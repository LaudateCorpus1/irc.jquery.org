[02:31:15] <Cork> um, why use eval though?
[02:31:35] <Cork> there is really no need for eval, and it is just a bad idea
[05:48:27] <codecutter> i'm looking a 'neat' way to check if an image fits the container (height wise) if not stretch it, initially on page load then during browser resize
[06:08:08] <Cork> codecutter: why not just put it as a background?
[06:28:11] <codecutter> Cork: I need to able to modify the position of the image using jquery's draggable
[06:29:08] <codecutter> placing it inside the image tag enables to add the offset value directly to the img tag
[06:30:02] <codecutter> besides draggable doesn't work with background imgs
[06:42:25] <Cork> ya, well you would have to either leave the img tag without width/height so you get the intristic size
[06:42:32] <Cork> or you have to load the image in a canvas
[06:42:38] <Cork> there is no other way to get the size
[06:47:59] <codecutter> intrinsic value option works but displaces the offset value
[06:48:10] <codecutter> i may need to tweek it a little
[06:48:28] <Cork> the what?
[06:48:46] <codecutter> position value set by draggable widget
[06:48:52] <codecutter> its no longer acurate
[06:48:58] <codecutter> on reload
[06:49:06] <Cork> ya, you most likely want to use a separate img tag for that
[06:49:27] <codecutter> how would that work?
[06:49:28] <Cork> as javascript can't calculate the size of things before load if you use intristic size
[06:49:48] <Cork> you leave the image fixed size, put the url in an img tag and wait for the load event on the image tag
[06:50:00] <Cork> then grab the height and width to get how big the real image is
[06:50:14] <Cork> then you can do your calculations
[06:50:34] <codecutter> i'll try that
[06:51:25] <Cork> you can do it with the normal img tag, but then you can't initialize draggable until the document load event has fired
[06:51:34] <Cork> and that you most likely don't want to do
[10:04:06] <gnstaxo> hello. who knows a js lib or jquery plugin to render simple markdown?
[13:42:07] <destramic> im trying to create a slider https://jsfiddle.net/rptuogx0/  it slides, but what i want is if you keep pressing the right button the order will change and the divs will come from the left, same if you press the left button the order changes and the div slide from the right

[13:50:59] <destramic> anyone about please? https://jsfiddle.net/u8L7e0v3/    im on the right track now
[18:36:47] <t432> center the image on page load then position https://codepen.io/apprence/pen/KKVwKBN
[18:37:03] <t432> center the image on page load ttps://codepen.io/apprence/pen/KKVwKBN
[19:53:34] <robertparkerx> how do you import jquery-migrate es6 ?
[19:53:51] <robertparkerx> I'm using import jQuery from 'jquery'
[21:18:53] <xae-x12> How would you go about using the current link that refreshes the captcha image to also refresh the captcha audio source? https://dpaste.org/HLvW
[21:21:15] <Hoppelhase> Doesn't $("#audioSource").attr("src", ...) work?
[21:21:51] <Hoppelhase> I don't know how audio streams are handled, perhaps you have to make a control reload the stream too
[21:23:07] <xae-x12> hmm what function would i put that in?
[21:23:58] <xae-x12> well i would assume it works the same way as the way the image is generated with the key since the keys are the same
[21:24:01] <Hoppelhase> Where you reload the image
[21:25:13] <xae-x12> Like this? https://dpaste.org/HLZq
[21:25:58] <Hoppelhase> Yes
[21:26:18] <xae-x12> ok i will give it a try
[21:26:27] <xae-x12> var audio = document.getElementById('audio');    audio.load();
[21:26:49] <xae-x12> That loads the audio tag again so i was wondering if you could do something like that for the source
[21:27:14] <Hoppelhase> Perhaps you have to call that too
[21:28:10] <xae-x12> That same audio.load()? Or would i need to change it to var source = document.getElementById('audioSource');   source.load();
[21:29:49] <Hoppelhase> I'd use $("#audioSource").get(0).load()
[21:30:27] <Hoppelhase> No wait, $("#audio"). Those are two different elements
[21:31:12] <xae-x12> ok like this? https://dpaste.org/A9iA
[21:32:36] <Hoppelhase> Does it work?
[21:33:14] <xae-x12> hold on im going to try
[21:37:27] <xae-x12> oh man i forgot that i have to test it on my linux computer my mac can't install sox and flite to test it i don't think
[21:38:08] <xae-x12> I have to switch PCs. I will come back later and let you know if it worked or not.
[21:38:50] <xae-x12> sox and flite are what turn the text in the image to speech audio
[21:39:00] <xae-x12> flite specifically sox just adds brown noise
[21:39:43] <xae-x12> but thank you for your help so far hoppelhase (y)  I hope it works
[21:40:04] <xae-x12> I will post the solution to stackoverflow for others of the django package to enjoy :)
[21:41:28] <Hoppelhase> Okay
[21:41:28] <xae-x12> when it is figured out of course
[22:12:02] <gnstaxo> how do I remove "controls" from <video controls> with jquery?
[22:17:35] <Hoppelhase> $("video").removeAttr("controls")
[22:43:48] <gnstaxo> thanks
[22:44:13] <xae-x12> back hoppelhase. It did not work. getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of undefined
[22:44:20] <xae-x12> for $("#audio").get(0).load()
[22:45:33] <xae-x12> and Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'load' of null
[22:45:43] <xae-x12> when i use var audio = document.getElementById('audio');    audio.load();
[22:52:01] <xae-x12> I have to put something inside of load() but what?
[22:52:04] <Hoppelhase> xae-x12: That means there is no element with ID "audio" in the current DOM
[22:52:16] <xae-x12> ooh let me check
[22:52:35] <Hoppelhase> What is the result of console.log($("#audio").length)?
[22:52:54] <xae-x12> i think it is because after changing PCs I forgot to include the audio ID
[22:53:00] <xae-x12> i'll try that too
[22:54:16] <xae-x12> nevermind i didn't have the IDs in the HTML and it worked :)
[22:54:30] <xae-x12> thank you, you are a genius :)
[22:54:52] <Hoppelhase> lol, thanks
[22:55:58] <xae-x12> and the crowd over at django on stackoverflow goes wild
[22:56:39] <xae-x12> You will hopefully have helped many people from this
[22:59:19] <Hoppelhase> Was that a django bug?
[23:03:30] <xae-x12> not a bug but i have seen others in the issues section of github say they didn't know how to do it. Plus I also wanted it for my site. Hopefully the maintainer of github will add it to the documentation
[23:04:06] <xae-x12> The maintainer of github doesn't update his code based on issues he just waits for pull requests
[23:04:17] <xae-x12> and doesn't help people with common use cases like this
[23:04:55] <xae-x12> Like i see a comment from years ago saying how to refresh the audio source with no solution for it lol
[23:05:30] <xae-x12> yet it is one of the most popular captcha django packages
[23:05:48] <xae-x12> because it avoids recaptcha cookies for cookie law that is the good thing
[23:06:19] <Hoppelhase> I see
[23:06:43] <xae-x12> yea django-recaptcha has 40+ bugs i reported a few
[23:07:07] <xae-x12> so i am using django-simple-captcha instead which is what you just helped with
[23:07:58] <xae-x12> My next task is to hopefully get the python channel to help me with django-csp nonce bug i found
[23:08:15] <xae-x12> bc i need it also and it is less secure the way it is now lol
[23:52:40] <gnstaxo> how can I download jquery's documentation as a PDF?
