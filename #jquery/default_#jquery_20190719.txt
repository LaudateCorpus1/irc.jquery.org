[00:24:31] <sixfingeredamish> hi
[00:25:23] <sixfingeredamish> I'm trying to use delegated event handlers. I only have access to div.modalContainer, but this div has many layers of children
[00:26:33] <sixfingeredamish> div.modalContainer > .jquery-modal > .modal > a.close-modal (which I what I want)
[00:26:50] <sixfingeredamish> How would I even select a.close-modal when it is many layers deep?
[00:42:22] <Uhkis> without seeing the actual html: $('.modalContainer').on('event', '.close-modal', function() {});
[00:57:52] <sixfingeredamish> Turns out I had a syntax issue
[00:57:58] <sixfingeredamish> $(".modalContainer").on( "click", "a.close-modal", function() { ended up working :)
[13:29:02] <Jan> how do I bind a onclick-Event to an element that is loaded later via ajax?
[13:56:16] <pavonia> Jan: Either directly via $elem.on("click", ...) or as delegated handler on the container via $cont.on("click", "elem", ...)
[14:05:46] <Jan> pavonia: If I just do an $(right_now_nonexistant_element).on("click"... it doesn't seem to work after the element is loaded.
[14:06:30] <pavonia> Right, because the element doesn't exist at that time
[14:07:14] <pavonia> So either bind it after it has been created, or use the event delegation approach
[14:14:58] <Jan> If by $cont you mean $("#the_element_where_its_being_loaded_in") then my mistake must be somewhere else, because that's what (I think) I'm doing.
[14:20:02] <pavonia> Show your real code then
[14:23:22] <Jan> Ha! Given that I'm basically right made me look harder. Thanks!
[14:25:09] <Jan> The problem was $("#elem notyetexisting").on(... instead of $("#elem").on(click, "notyetexisting"...
[14:25:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah - delegation :)
[21:17:53] <beshoo> how can sellect this button
[21:17:53] <beshoo> <button type="button">TEST</button>
[21:18:04] <beshoo> what is the sellector to catch it ?
[21:18:16] <beshoo> can i catch it by the TEST string ?
[21:18:37] <beshoo> $('What should i type')
[21:28:02] <pavonia> You should give it an id and match on that via "#myid"
[21:28:15] <beshoo> i don't have contall on the page
[21:28:25] <beshoo> i know that it should have an id
[21:28:42] <beshoo> but i don't have contall on the page , i am doing headless crowling
[21:30:34] <pavonia> Then "button[type=button]", but it will also match other buttons with that type
[21:54:45] <beshoo> Array.prototype.find.call(document.getElementsByTagName('button'), btn => btn.textContent === 'Testing'));
[21:54:54] <beshoo> this make the trick
