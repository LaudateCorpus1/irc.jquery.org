[00:06:09] <jonnu> adam007: jCarousel?
[00:06:56] <jonnu> adam: or just another carousel.  any carousel will do it, most allow you to slide other content (such as LIs) instead of just images or what have you.
[00:08:14] <adam007> owh ok thanks :) i will try it

[00:39:02] <suhail_ssw> Hi guys
[00:40:12] <suhail_ssw> I am not getting anything on screen. is anybody typing?
[00:41:44] <iateadonut> no
[00:44:41] <suhail_ssw> hi
[00:45:13] * xec|work hides
[00:45:32] <suhail_ssw> anybody there?

[00:45:52] <suhail_ssw> yes
[00:46:02] <irenicus09> hi guys..any quickstart guide for a jquery n00b?
[00:46:53] <xec|work> ok cool, a good tip is to read the topic on any channel you enter - on this one, for instance, happens to say "Just ask!" among other things ;)
[00:47:47] <xec|work> irenicus09: on the jquery.com front page there are four links in the middle, under the heading "Getting Started With jQuery"
[00:49:25] <xec|work> irenicus09: but it's pretty much aimed at people who already know javascript (and css)
[00:49:46] <suhail_ssw_> hi
[00:49:46] <irenicus09> xec|work: what if someone doesn't know javascript...where does he start off then? :P
[00:49:53] <coldhead> ?101
[00:49:56] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[00:50:19] <irenicus09> xec|work: it's like you're trying to build a wooden house but you don't have an axe to chop off a tree

[00:52:53] <suhail_ssw_> Problem:Using jQuery, Edit href of <a> tags on html page that belong to my Domain(website) And leave the <a> tags of other sites as they are. (Without using .each )
[00:53:36] <adam007> please :(
[00:53:47] <suhail_ssw_> Problem:Using jQuery, Edit href of <a> tags on html page that belong to my Domain(website) And leave the <a> tags of other sites as they are. (Without using .each )
[00:53:58] <xec|work> suhail_ssw_: don't repeat yourself
[00:54:26] <suhail_ssw_> Sorry
[00:54:55] <suhail_ssw_> <xec|work> Can u help plz
[00:55:08] <xec|work> adam007: there are about a thousand slider plugins, i'm sure googling and reading forums etc will be more efficient than irc for you
[00:55:32] <xec|work> suhail_ssw_: why on earth are you avoiding .each() ?
[00:56:05] <xec|work> dam i sound like a bitch to day
[00:56:09] <xec|work> today*
[00:56:24] <suhail_ssw_> <xec|work> i dont need plug-ins. I need the 1 or 2 lines code that will chain together different selectors and methods and give me the answer.
[00:56:45] <xec|work> suhail_ssw_: .each() is not a plug-in
[00:56:55] <adam007> xec i already search but im not find someone tell me edit nivo slider plugin but i dont know how to edit it
[00:57:23] <suhail_ssw_> Bcoz using that i was able to do the thing.. But i am wondering whether i can do the same without .each ... May be in one line of code
[00:57:38] <iateadonut> $('a').css('href', 'something');
[00:57:47] <iateadonut> or maybe $('a').attr('href', 'something');
[00:57:57] <coldhead> suhail_ssw_: just remove the newlines in your each() function and hey presto - 1 line of code
[00:58:08] <xec|work> coldhead++
[00:58:18] <coldhead> you can't do it without each
[00:58:24] <coldhead> unless you want them all to be the same
[00:58:24] <iateadonut> of course, i don't understand what you're talking about leaving tags of other sites as they are.
[00:58:25] <suhail_ssw_> I know what "each" is
[00:58:46] <coldhead> at the end of your fancy selector you will have all your site's links selected.... and you will then set them all to the same thing
[00:58:56] <coldhead> only each lets you manipulate them individually
[00:59:51] <suhail_ssw_> <iateadonut> i have to edit href of <a> of my site and append querystring to them. got it?
[00:59:56] <coldhead> $('a[href^="/"], a[href^="http://ursite.com/"]').attr('href', 'THIS CLOBBERS EVERYTHING')
[01:00:08] <NodeX> use prop()
[01:00:41] <coldhead> if you want to add the query string to DIFFERENT links you HAVE to use each() because you will need to access each original href
[01:00:45] <coldhead> keyword is each
[01:00:52] <coldhead> each each each each ima eachu
[01:02:37] <D4> I've got right: 0; and I'm animating left: 0; but how do I completely remove right: 0;? Unless I do, it sees it as.. well like 100% width
[01:03:04] <iateadonut> append querystring?
[01:03:41] <coldhead> you COULD do it in one line if you write a plugin to provide appendToHref()
[01:03:49] <coldhead> that plugin will probably use each :D
[01:03:55] <suhail_ssw> <coldhead> But my code should work on any domain. so i wrote var myDomain = $(location).attr('hostname'); to get domain name.
[01:04:04] <xec|work> D4: yeah you can't do that without removing the "right" property, and then i expect something will jump, time to rethink it ;)
[01:04:21] <coldhead> that doesn't preclude you from using each()
[01:04:30] <xec|work> D4: setting both right and left will stretch it (or squeeze)
[01:04:49] <iateadonut> what's the purpose of this?
[01:05:28] <D4> sigh, going nuts on this damn button - xec|work I'm going with the 'fixed' property to make it scroll with the element, but it really doesn't work well
[01:05:40] <suhail_ssw> so, after that i wrote $('a[href*=myDomain]').prop('href',$(this).prop('href')+"?name=abc");
[01:06:08] <suhail_ssw> but this line isnt working :(
[01:06:25] <xec|work> suhail_ssw: "this" is going to be the global object there
[01:07:05] <xec|work> suhail_ssw: using each, you can access each element individually, which is key to your logic
[01:07:19] <xec|work> makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:07:41] <coldhead> suhail_ssw: http://jsfiddle.net/rQD2P/
[01:08:05] <coldhead> suhail_ssw: in your one liner, `this` will refer to window
[01:08:07] <suhail_ssw> thank u :)
[01:08:15] <coldhead> you have to use each() to make this be what you want
[01:08:51] <coldhead> let us never speak of this again
[01:11:36] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/748892/ hm, how get a.href or img.src value after click a.btn link?
[01:12:31] <coldhead> HM
[01:12:44] <xec|work> eshlox: you'll have to do some DOM traversing to find the image, probably see ?closest
[01:12:45] <bot-t> eshlox, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:13:14] <xec|work> eshlox:  to find the containing div, and then you can see ?find
[01:13:15] <bot-t> eshlox, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[01:13:31] <NodeX> $('.btn').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); var p=$().parents('div'); var i=p.find('img'); var a=p.find('a'); });
[01:13:33] <eshlox> $(this).closest('img').attr('src')?
[01:13:51] <eshlox> uhm
[01:14:12] <xec|work> eshlox: no, read the docs, there are nice examples there
[01:14:29] <NodeX> The answer is ^^#
[01:14:33] <xec|work> NodeX's code is close but missing something essential ;)
[01:14:36] <NodeX> i is the image, a is the a
[01:14:53] <NodeX> var p=$(this).parents('div');
[01:14:56] <NodeX> (typo)
[01:15:27] <xec|work> NodeX: still not quite there
[01:15:33] <NodeX> lol and how is that ?
[01:15:45] <xec|work> but spoonfeeding is not very heplful
[01:15:48] <coldhead> eshlox: http://wklej.org/id/748894/
[01:15:55] <xec|work> NodeX: there are multiple a elements in that div
[01:16:00] <coldhead> spoonfeeding helps people shutup sometimes
[01:16:06] <NodeX> and?
[01:16:12] <NodeX> he wanted the image and the anchor
[01:16:18] <coldhead> and GREAT WORK EVERYONE TAKE 5
[01:16:26] <NodeX> he/she
[01:16:31] <coldhead> don't tell me what he wanted you gobshite
[01:16:35] <coldhead> i'll kill all of you
[01:16:43] <soee> does backslash has to be addedd in any special way inside regular expr ?
[01:16:45] * xec|work hides behind NodeX
[01:16:48] <coldhead> i love you guys
[01:16:55] * irenicus09 takes out his AK
[01:17:08] <coldhead> it has special meaning in a regex so you have to escape it, soee
[01:17:14] <NodeX> if you really want to filter out the button clicked then add not($(this))
[01:17:18] <coldhead> /\\/ // matches a literal \
[01:17:46] <NodeX> eshlox : you really should add some classes or ID's to your elements
[01:17:49] <soee> ok let me try
[01:18:15] <coldhead> good luck kids
[01:18:28] <xec|work> NodeX: there is a class on both the anchors
[01:18:39] <NodeX> $('.btn').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); var p=$(this).parents('div');  var a=p.find('.thumbnail'); var i=a.find('img'); });
[01:19:18] <NodeX> boom
[01:19:43] <xec|work> :D
[01:20:15] <xec|work> but what is the href and the src?!
[01:20:41] <NodeX> a = the a object and i = the image object
[01:21:00] <NodeX> if the user can't get the props from the object trhe web development is not the trade for them
[01:21:05] <NodeX> the*
[01:21:15] <NodeX> then*
[01:21:38] <xec|work> but but but alert(i) just giefs [object Object] ?!
[01:21:48] <xec|work> haalp
[01:22:12] * xec|work dies in a fire
[01:22:31] <NodeX> why would you ever alert an object
[01:22:42] <NodeX> infact why would you alert anythign when you can console.log
[01:23:00] <xec|work> alert is the only way to debug javascript, everyone knows this
[01:23:01] <NodeX> or is this that sarcasm thing I've been hearing baout
[01:23:04] <NodeX> about*
[01:23:17] <xec|work> +10 point
[01:23:18] <xec|work> s
[01:23:33] <Whirl3d> wow, did I stumble into #CSS by accident?
[01:23:59] <NodeX> lolol
[01:24:06] <xec|work> Whirl3d: if you did, surely someone would have called you names by now
[01:24:37] <NodeX> yeh like farty-pants
[01:24:45] <xec|work> burn!
[01:26:10] <Whirl3d> Oh, I just noticed all the heckling and thought for sure I had picked the wrong channel. Usually this channel is full of love and support--peppered of course with the occasional bit of sarcasm for contrast.
[01:26:34] <Whirl3d> I must've just rejoined during the peppering. LOL
[01:26:56] <NodeX> that's what she said
[01:28:19] <xec|work> Whirl3d: i got out of bed on the wrong side this morning, dunno why but i feel like hitting someone with a stick. i don't have a stick and am not allowed to hit people at work unfortunately, but readily accessible i have a keyboard and irc
[01:28:37] * xec|work eyeballs the channel
[01:28:40] <Whirl3d> beat me daddy, beat me. LOL
[01:28:44] <xec|work> rofl
[01:28:54] <xec|work> this just got way out of hand really quickly
[01:29:51] <NodeX> I thought this was a family oriented channel
[01:29:57] <NodeX> turns out its Object oriented
[01:30:05] <NodeX> "boom boom"
[01:30:26] <xec|work> can't make a family without fucking, i always say
[01:30:46] <soee> any idea why this: [a-zA-ZąćęłńóśźżĄĘŁŃÓŚŹŻ0-9\-\/]{0,20} throws error when / is in side string ?
[01:31:34] <noaXess> hey all
[01:32:06] <noaXess> someone has working fancybox inside fancybox script?...
[01:32:19] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/GR0w8L2y Why this returns "Uncaught ReferenceError: e is not defined"?
[01:32:36] <xec|work> soee: yes, \ is the escape character, and as such, would need to be escaped itself
[01:32:48] <xec|work> soee: so if you want to match a \ do \\
[01:32:52] <quicksilver> rethus: because e is not defined :)
[01:33:04] <soee> xec, i want to escape only "/"
[01:33:06] <quicksilver> rethus: you probably intend e to be the name of the parameter to the event callback
[01:33:13] <quicksilver> rethus: then ...function(e){...}
[01:33:13] <raj> with .sortable(), if I add additional li's in the containing ul (the ul had .sortable() run on it), will it allow sorting of those li's as well, without having to rerun sortable?
[01:33:17] <soee> or it doesn't have to be escaped
[01:33:19] <soee> ?
[01:33:22] <quicksilver> rethus: (you did also mis-spell preventDefault)
[01:33:45] <rethus> ah, ok. i tryed before wit (e) .. now i see.
[01:33:47] <rethus> thanks
[01:33:54] <xec|work> oh sorry misread that
[01:34:41] <xec|work> ?eval /\//.test("/")
[01:34:43] <bot-t> xec|work: true
[01:34:54] <Whirl3d> oh gawd, I just spent the last half hour desperately trying to figure out why console was logging [object object] instead of the jquery object...just realized, you can't use console.log("showing "+jqobj), you need console.log("showing ",jqobj); How miserable.
[01:35:00] <xec|work> soee: does that answer your question?
[01:35:21] <Whirl3d> Now I have to undo all the frantic crap I was doing to get to the bottom of this typo... not good
[01:36:32] <quicksilver> xec|work: you do need another level of escaping if you've represented the regex as a string, such as in a jquery selector
[01:36:42] <quicksilver> (could possibly what was happening to soee)
[01:40:27] <Trisox> any one know wy it opens both dropdowns http://jsfiddle.net/ftBL5/10/ ?
[01:43:27] <Zhy> are you binding the opening to the dropdown class? because the class is not unique and applies to both dropdowns
[01:44:31] <Trisox> well this is twitter bootstrap
[01:44:46] <Trisox> but need it to work on old version of jquery dont ask me wy...
[01:45:20] <Zhy> :) I'm not familiar with twitter bootstrap, sorry
[01:45:25] <Zhy> was just a guess, really :>
[01:45:32] <quicksilver> icky missing out of semicolons
[01:45:49] <quicksilver> don't recommend that style personally.
[01:46:52] <quicksilver> it seems very important that that code can correctly calculate $parent
[01:46:59] <quicksilver> and I don't follow how it would work
[01:47:22] <quicksilver> it seems to look for 'data-target' and 'href' attributes you're not using
[01:47:26] <Trisox> this is the twitter bootstrap code
[01:47:33] <Trisox> ahh :)
[01:48:26] <Trisox> well http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#buttonDropdowns
[01:52:44] <DannyZB> Question : What do you usually do when you want to distribute a plug-in that uses other plug-ins inside ?
[01:53:00] <DannyZB> I have a jQuery plug-in that uses jQGrid and plupload
[01:53:45] <noaXess> i need the link/url i clicked to $.get() the data from that link and put the response data into a div and open a dialog.. :)..
[02:01:26] <raj> how can I disable the movement of one item with sortable?
[02:08:31] <Zhy> $( ".selector" ).sortable({ cancel: 'button' })  "Prevents sorting if you start on elements matching the selector."
[02:08:59] <Zhy> if you need to do this on a fly you could addClass someclass and then cancel: '.someclass' in your sortable
[02:09:04] <Zhy> *on the fly
[02:16:28] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/ftBL5/14/ 	$('body').bind('click.dropdown.data-api', toggle, Dropdown.prototype.toggle); works but shows 2  $('body').on('click.dropdown.data-api', toggle, Dropdown.prototype.toggle); shows one .on is doing something fancy how can i -->NOT<-- use on
[02:24:40] <sh0ne> Guys, I have a problem with a simple script. I have a hidden select tag in html page and I want to print the name ($(this).attr('value')) and along that to clone that select tag to a div whenever I click the button. The thing is when i click the button first time it prints the name and besides that a select tag like it should, but when I click it again the name appears normal but the select tag is printed twice, when I click the third
[02:24:40] <sh0ne>  time, the name appears and besides that a select tag a four times, and so on. Does variables in JS remember the old value? http://pastebin.com/BeuT2JyN
[02:30:22] <Trisox> sh0ne: clone clones also events if i remember correctly

[02:35:51] <diverdude> Anybody used plupload in here before? I have problems disabling resize of images
[02:48:49] <rethus> how can i slice a div and put it into aother location
[02:55:27] <Whirl3d> when using .then on a deferred to attach a resolve callback, if I want to attach multiple callbacks, do I have to do multiple .thens or can I pass an array of callback handlers like def.then([showImage, addImage], addImage);
[02:55:31] <nFFF> slice a div?
[02:56:03] <nFFF> Whirl3d, can't you put your code in one callback?
[02:56:15] <Whirl3d> not easily
[02:56:15] <nFFF> You can place multiple .then in your code or .success
[02:56:47] <Whirl3d> I'll try it with .success, thanks.
[02:57:17] <Whirl3d> .done fires for both resolve and reject, right?
[02:57:32] <jonkersjoe> hi, does anyone know how to stringify this http://jsfiddle.net/MW4HF/1/ ?
[02:57:38] <nFFF> Check the docs, not sure of top of head
[02:57:47] <Whirl3d> will do. thanks for the reply

[02:59:00] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[02:59:21] <Whirl3d> yeah. success is a custom callback for load, not deferreds...I think
[03:00:15] <Whirl3d> fyi, .done accepts the array of callbacks.
[03:04:21] <nFFF> Yea sorry was presuming you where using defferreds in an AJAX request
[03:05:23] <nFFF> Yea just read the docs you can chain done's, and supply any number of arguments
[03:05:37] <nFFF> wierd was arguing with someone about this 3-04 weeks ago
[03:06:35] <Trisox> nfff is there something that .on can do that live delegate and bind cant?
[03:06:42] <Trisox> that you know of
[03:07:31] <nFFF> Trisox, the other two are deprecated, the question is, is there something live, delegate and bind can do that on cant?
[03:08:12] <Nece228> hello

[03:08:21] <Trisox> well i have got a script using on but the version of jquery is 1.4.x
[03:08:24] <Nece228> html: items.join('')
[03:08:37] <Nece228> does this mean that after html: i can write html code?
[03:08:51] <Trisox> i need to build it to use bind but somehow it doesnt work
[03:11:11] <Trisox> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/ftBL5/14/ any idea's ?
[03:12:08] <Trisox> sorry this one http://jsfiddle.net/ftBL5/15/
[03:12:19] <soee> anyone who have some expirience with jq tools tooltip ?

[03:27:54] <jpic> i'm mainly wondering if what i'm trying to do with the overrides system is ok, i "invented" it so althought it works, i'm not confident
[03:28:10] <jpic> using $.extend(someobj, overrides)
[03:32:37] <Nece228> can i animate .remove() event?
[03:36:29] <Xotix> Nece228 you could make any animation which looks like it gets removed and the nactually call remove()
[03:39:28] <nmee> Hi, I currently use $('.container').append('<div...>') to create a new div element, but is there a better way to create a new object that lets me immediately retrieve the jQuery object for the new element?
[03:40:18] <Nece228> Xotix: for example?
[03:40:32] <Nece228> $(this).parent().parent().animate({}).remove();
[03:40:46] <Nece228> this is my line inside curly brackets i need to do something to make it hide
[03:40:59] <quicksilver> nmee: var foo = $('<div ....>').appendTo($('.container'))
[03:41:04] <suhail_ssw> Hi guys i am back :)
[03:41:11] <Xotix> idk. slide it away, change height to 0 or width or change its aehm hwo do you call it … liek dim it. :P
[03:41:25] <Nece228> how to slide it away?
[03:42:17] <suhail_ssw> Anybody here?
[03:43:27] <nmee> quicksilver: thanks!
[03:44:42] <Xotix> Neco228 e.g. $('#element').animate({ left: −500, }, 500).remove();  this would position your element from whatever location it has to −500, probably isn't very useable for your need. Try to do something with opacity or height/width. you must experiment
[03:45:31] <Lachezar> Hello all. Can I style my site to follow a jquery theme? Any pointers?
[03:46:15] <Xotix> Lachezar use the css classes of the themes? there are for sure some articels around.
[03:47:23] <Lachezar> Xotix: I would think so, but failed to find any reading...
[03:47:53] <Lachezar> Xotix: Many explanataions how to write a theme, but not how to apply a ready theme to an existing page.
[03:49:06] <Nece228> does .fadeOut hide the element or removes it completely?
[03:49:27] <Xotix> Lachezar then just check it out yourself. the theme generator always creates the same files with the same classes.
[03:58:50] <jacb0z1> I have this function with a timeout, it is set to run each minute. When the function runs, it appends some items to a list, and fires a plugin that scrolls that list. The problem is, that each time the function run, the plugin multiplies. so, after three minutes, the list fires the scroll animation 3 times
[03:59:17] <jacb0z1> after appending items to the list, this fires: var stn = $('#news').scrollNews({timeout:rssSpeed,speed: 2000});
[03:59:34] <jacb0z1> then i fire the timeout: t=setTimeout('getNews()',newsUpdate*60*1000);
[04:00:24] <jacb0z1> is it me or the plugin that is the problem ?
[04:00:39] <irenicus09> hi anyone knows whats the best free jquery plugin for an image scroller with cool transitions?
[04:01:34] <dr0id> google does
[04:01:44] <jacb0z1> irenicus09: Nivo
[04:02:00] <irenicus09> jacb0z1: thanks
[04:02:29] <irenicus09> dr0id: google already did answer me...I was just asking for opinions..
[04:02:37] <dr0id> nivo
[04:06:20] <NodeX> irenicus09 : define cool
[04:13:39] <Zhy> I need to retrieve (and change ) the html contents of a few divs with a certain class, but I can only access the first occurrence of said class - any way around that?
[04:14:19] <Zhy> basically I need something like if($('.edit').html() ==='Click to edit'){/* change the content of the div */ }
[04:26:43] <NodeX> Zhy .. each()
[04:26:46] <quicksilver> Zhy: use .each() to loop through them all
[04:35:03] <Zhy> oh bob saget I thought I'd tried that ... thanks NodeX and quicksilver. One thing though:
[04:35:35] <Zhy> $.each('.edit', function(){  /* blabla*/     }); I'm doing it like this, how would I access the html of only the current .each object?
[04:38:38] <frgr> Hi
[04:39:27] <frgr> Im trying to parse a json from a php script (json_encode()) with jQuery. Does anyone know  whats wrong there? http://jsfiddle.net/mrjxz/1/
[04:40:29] <frgr> I have no idea what could be the problem.
[04:41:12] <Nicke\> Is it possible to reparse stumbleupon and reddit buttons upon ajax request?
[04:42:27] <frgr> Just alert(json); show "null"
[04:42:49] <quicksilver> Zhy: not like that, no.
[04:43:01] <frgr> jesus. Every secound a person join or part.
[04:44:12] <Zhy> quicksilver: hmm how else then? I'm a bit at a loss here. It seems to iterate correctly through all occurrences of '.edit'
[04:44:40] <quicksilver> Zhy: $('.edit').each(function() { ... refer to this... } )
[04:45:09] <NET||abuse> hmm
[04:45:50] <frgr> Im trying to parse a json from a php script (json_encode()) with jQuery. Does anyone know  whats wrong there? http://jsfiddle.net/mrjxz/1/
[04:46:27] <Zhy> Thanks a lot quicksilver :) what really makes me mad is that that was the first thing that I tried... apparently incorrectly at the time... oh well :D
[04:47:12] <NET||abuse> i have a module,   (function(parent){ var initvals, foo = parent.foo = parent.foo||{} ;  foo.init=function(args){ initvals=args;} foo.check=function(){console.log(initvals);} })(mymodule||{});
[04:47:32] <NET||abuse> running oh, i forgot to return parent at the end there.
[04:47:40] <frgr> .....
[04:47:54] <quicksilver> Zhy: you're very welcome :)
[04:48:12] <NET||abuse> anyway,   var mymodule = (function(parent){...etc )(mymodule||{});
[04:48:25] <quicksilver> frgr: I don't believe you need to parseJSON if you set dataType: "json"
[04:48:31] <quicksilver> frgr: as far as I remember it parses it for you
[04:48:43] <frgr> hmm, i take a look
[04:48:43] <quicksilver> (and that console.log appears to be saying that)
[04:48:57] <quicksilver> data is already a javascript object (JSON already parsed)
[04:49:12] <granden> To be able to slide an image left to right and vice versa. in a div. How would I do it, now I got like <div id="slide"></div> and using jquery I want to slide in a new picture from right to left when clicking a button.
[04:49:12] <NET||abuse> anyway, when i run var args = {somekey:'value'}; mymodule.foo.init(args); mymodule.foo.check();   i can't see the values of the object in the console anyway
[04:49:16] <granden> My first thought was using .click(animate())
[04:49:43] <granden> but how do I tell animate what where it should be animated so it dont animate the clicked link.
[04:49:52] <frgr> quicksilver: you are right :D thanks
[04:51:18] <soee> how can i access checkbox with name like this: name="test[foo][]" and if its value = 0 than all other checkboxes with the same name should be checked etc ?
[04:53:36] <LondonGuy> Hi room, wondering if anyone could help me out with some code that expands text area vertically automatically. It doesn't seem to be having effect if I use it at the end of a chain and only works when i apply it to the end of a selector e.g. $('textarea').autoGrow();

[04:58:15] <andr0id> hey guys, how can i add a dropdown with search filters on this plugin: http://tablesorter.com/docs/ ?
[04:58:30] <andr0id> lets say that the dropdown has few predefined values
[05:00:28] <diverdude> anybody used plupload and experienced when not resizing images, it throws an error: Failed to move uploaded file ?
[05:01:04] <andr0id> i havent, cause i use php for image uploads
[05:02:23] <andr0id> and check folder and file permissions
[05:03:51] <diverdude> andr0id: permissions are ok
[05:03:57] <diverdude> andr0id: are 777
[05:04:14] <andr0id> paste the code somewhere so we can take a look at it
[05:04:19] <granden> http://agfoto.se/acte/index.html
[05:04:35] <granden> Got like that, but when clicking one of the top images the corresponding image below should slid in.
[05:04:41] <granden> From correct side.
[05:04:49] <granden> I did give it a try with what I thought should do it
[05:06:11] <andr0id> try adding a function that gets the clicked image, and that one to be the value of the img inside the div.
[05:07:19] <granden> andr0id: hmm
[05:07:37] <andr0id> initialy, the value is: ''
[05:07:51] <granden> andr0id: Don't really get it. Could you give an example.
[05:08:25] <andr0id> first, get the content of the div.
[05:08:33] <andr0id> it should be ''
[05:08:36] <andr0id> next
[05:08:56] <andr0id> when image clicked, uste the animate method
[05:09:08] <andr0id> better now?
[05:11:18] <granden> andr0id: Hmm, think so, will give it a try.
[05:12:08] <granden> andr0id: Will you be here a while? I have to run out of office for a while and probably would need a little bit help when I'm back with this.
[05:12:20] <granden> about 20-30 minutes just.
[05:12:24] <andr0id> i dont know
[05:12:43] <andr0id> if i am, will help
[05:17:38] <granden> Ok, $('#id1').click(function(){ $('#slide').addHTML('<img src="image1.png">').animate({'left' : '400px'},1000)

[05:24:55] <raj> jeffsmykil, nice
[05:25:11] <andr0id> or you can try this: put them in sepparate divs, and use the accordion slide effect
[05:25:48] <xec|work> raj: step 6 is "click the x on tab 1" and step 7 is "click tab 1" ?
[05:26:02] <granden> andr0id: Hmm, what?! :)
[05:26:38] <raj> shoot, let me restate
[05:26:42] <xec|work> raj: so, step 6, remove tab 1, step 7 click the tab you just removed? :P

[05:28:55] <diverdude> how do i turn off resizing in plupload lib?
[05:29:10] <raj> xec|work, ^^
[05:29:53] <raj> basically, the form disappears and therefore the href in the tab's <a> cannot retrieve the body
[05:31:07] <Zhy> raj: when I click on tab 1 at last everything stays as it is ... using chrome
[05:31:11] <Whirl3d> has anyone else had any problems with animate durations not processing correctly? I put in a duration of 8000 expecting an 8 second animation and it still happens instantly.  Any ideas before I go any further?
[05:31:20] <raj> I'm using chrome as well
[05:31:26] <Zhy> Strange Oo
[05:31:27] <xec|work> raj: i don't think i'm strong enough with the force for this, i get confused by all the steps :D
[05:31:49] <xec|work> in firefox nothing happens as well
[05:31:52] <raj> really? I should combine some steps to make it seem shorter
[05:32:03] <Zhy> ah wait, icannot switch to tab 1
[05:32:06] <Zhy> it stays at tab 4
[05:32:08] <xec|work> but you do not activate tab 1, and uncaught exception: jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier
[05:32:40] <ansimation> I've got a weird issue with this page here http://173.168.172.225/fandistro/dev/projects/new/step2/ - when you toggle 'make all full length' it works as it should but for some reason the checkbox isn't getting a check. the markup shows a checked="checked" being added and removed but it's not actually visible for some reason? here's the code the handles the toggleing http://pastebin.com/1GzCGD81
[05:32:56] <raj> error occurs in FF as well
[05:33:08] <raj> xec|work, yes, that's the error
[05:34:20] <diverdude> how do i turn off resizing in plupload lib?
[05:35:14] <xec|work> raj: yeah it seems it removes the wrong tabs content
[05:35:35] <ansimation> diverdude,  dont pass the option iirc. checks the docs it's in there i saw it last week
[05:35:42] <raj> but then wouldn't there be duplicate content in one of the remaining tabs?
[05:35:45] <xec|work> raj: i did my own arbitrary steps and are left with buttons for tab 1 and 2 but forms 2 and 3
[05:35:59] <raj> interesting
[05:36:05] <diverdude> ansimation: if i dont pass the option the file fails to upload
[05:36:11] <raj> why in the world is that ocurring?
[05:36:16] <andr0id> granden: cant find my source now, better asc xec|work
[05:36:25] <raj> *occurring
[05:36:35] <ansimation> are the files being chunked?
[05:36:51] <ansimation> they may be too large to upload unless they're resized
[05:37:07] <xec|work> andr0id: what? did i miss something?
[05:37:20] <ansimation> also check your max upload size and max post size values in php.ini if you dont want to chunk
[05:37:44] <andr0id> its a question that granden asked, but i cant find my tricky little book to help him
[05:37:53] <andr0id> so if you can, hel him
[05:37:54] <diverdude> ansimation: how can i check if they are chunked?
[05:38:34] <granden> xec|work: got this, http://agfoto.se/acte/index.html
[05:38:36] <xec|work> raj: i think it has to be in the remove logic somewhere
[05:38:55] <raj> yeah, that's what the stack is pointing at
[05:39:00] <raj> but I don't see how this could be happening
[05:39:01] <ansimation> if you're not passing chunk_size as an option it isnt chunking. try chunk_size: 50000 or something and see if it works then
[05:39:05] <granden> xec|work: And I would like it so that when pressing one of the images at the top
[05:39:05] <raj> it's a straight forward remove
[05:39:27] <granden> it should slide in the corresponding image
[05:39:36] <granden> id1=i1 id2=i2 etc etc.
[05:39:49] <granden> from right to left.
[05:40:53] <xec|work> granden: slide in what image? i see four image buttons - you want to move the one you click into the red frame?
[05:40:55] <ansimation> anyone have a chance to look at my checkbox issue?
[05:41:09] <granden> xec|work: I got four images in that red frame.
[05:41:13] <jeffsmykil> you try to help an engineer and you just end up fucking things up
[05:41:14] <granden> But they got style="display:none";
[05:41:47] <granden> they should be invisible first, bet when pressing image at the top the correct image should slide in from the correct side if you get what I mean
[05:41:51] <granden> and the current image should slide out.
[05:42:01] <xec|work> oh that's weird, they weren't showing up in my dom, but after a refresh i see them - okay i get you so far
[05:42:29] <ansimation> so pass in an id when the top image is clicked. onclick="return doSomething(2);"
[05:42:32] <granden> xec|work: Strange, perhaps the upload to my ftp was a bit slow.
[05:42:58] <ansimation> then in do something, slide out the current image, and in the box with id 2
[05:43:12] <Edited> help-me
[05:43:15] <soee> i have element that show sup onclick, how can i make him hide when user press mouse outside this element ?
[05:43:35] <granden> ansimation: Was that to me?
[05:43:42] <ansimation> yeah
[05:43:47] <granden> Ok
[05:44:12] <granden> so I add that onclick to all four images.
[05:44:17] <granden> with corresponding number id.
[05:44:19] <Edited> plugin RSS com media?
[05:44:27] <granden> but doing the sliding is something I dont really know how to do.
[05:44:44] <ansimation> at the top that slide in the big images. i havent looked at your page but based on what you've been saying thats how i think i would go about doing it
[05:44:49] <raj> leaving me xec? =T
[05:44:56] <xec|work> granden: i wouldnt worry about the id's, you can use their index as long as you want the second button to link to second image etc
[05:45:00] <Edited> rss plugin exists with media
[05:45:04] <Edited> rss plugin exists with media?
[05:45:15] <granden> xec|work: Yeah exactly thats how I want.
[05:45:24] <xec|work> raj: yeah i'm not strong enough in the force yet
[05:45:26] <granden> Also going to add 2 more buttons later on, one prev and one next.
[05:45:34] <ansimation> .animate() makes animating things easy
[05:45:41] <xec|work> granden: how good are you at css?
[05:45:48] <raj> :) lol, k
[05:46:08] <granden> xec|work: No jedi. I'm ok I would say.
[05:46:36] <xec|work> granden: i'm thinking you could use positioning and hidden overflow
[05:46:38] <jeffsmykil> 1st world problem: when Amazon doesn't have what you want on Prime.
[05:46:54] <raj> ok, time to close my eyes real tight, fold my hands together, and ping ajpiano
[05:47:09] <granden> xec|work: Can you make it a slideing in effect using that?
[05:47:14] <raj> if you're up there, I could really use your help right now =)
[05:47:16] <xec|work> granden: if you make every image position: absolute; inside the red frame you remove them from normal flow, and then you can manipulate margin-left to animate
[05:47:18] <jeffsmykil> raj: I will prepare the chicken for you
[05:47:54] <xec|work> granden: for instance, margin-left: 100% would put an image to the right of the frame assuming all images are the same size as the red square
[05:48:37] <xec|work> granden: margin-left: 0; is center and margin-left: -100%; would be to the left
[05:49:04] <xec|work> ?animate @ granden
[05:49:04] <bot-t> granden, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:49:33] <xec|work> granden: if any of this sounds confusing to you don't hesitate to let me know
[05:49:41] <raj> damnit, completely at a standstill till I can solve this issue
[05:49:42] <granden> Hmm
[05:50:05] <granden> Just to check if I understand.
[05:50:24] <granden> 1. Add all images, put them to the right of the redbox. So they wont show.
[05:50:34] <granden> When clicking an image on the top they should slide in
[05:50:38] <xec|work> raj: sometimes i rewrite an entire function or method a different way just because i cant find out what i did wrong ;)
[05:50:42] <granden> by changing margin-left:
[05:50:47] <granden> ?
[05:50:55] <xec|work> granden: yeah that could work
[05:50:57] <raj> xec|work, you mean my fiddle?
[05:51:25] <granden> xec|work: Not what you meant?
[05:51:37] <Edited> rss plugin exists with media?
[05:51:38] <Edited> rss plugin exists with media?
[05:51:40] <raj> i changed my function's codes a couple times before determining I needed to ask
[05:51:48] <raj> functions' codes
[05:52:21] <granden> xec|work: If you check the site now, it looks kind of crazy.
[05:52:28] <xec|work> granden: what you said makes sense, now you got the first image sliding in. to find out which one you can see ?index
[05:52:29] <bot-t> granden, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[05:53:22] <granden> that last part I did not understand at all. with index.
[05:53:33] <xec|work> granden: the images don't have position: absolute; so they are not removed from the flow (my idea requires them to be on top of eachother)
[05:53:47] <raj> xec|work, anyone else I can look out for besides ajpiano that would be knowledgeable enough in UI to solve this?
[05:53:47] <granden> oh
[05:54:57] <granden> xec|work: Added position:absolute; to all images now.
[05:55:01] <xec|work> granden: when you click a button, find its index, and then you find the corresponding image by index from the slide div
[05:56:46] <xec|work> granden: also, text-align: center; isn't going to work well with this idea
[05:57:56] <xec|work> granden: but the next step would be to check to see if an image has margin-left set to 0, if so move it left
[05:58:45] <xec|work> and then it is done moving left, put it back to the right so it's ready to move again
[05:58:47] <granden> xec|work: oh, that was something old.
[05:59:23] <granden> xec|work: But clicking an image to the left of the current should have the big image slide in from the left to right. Iy you get what I mean?
[05:59:47] <xec|work> ohh you want the entire set to move back and forth?
[05:59:59] <granden> yes
[06:00:08] <xec|work> then i would do something entirely different :D
[06:00:12] <granden> oh
[06:00:14] <granden> sorry
[06:00:18] <granden> Was not that clear.
[06:00:20] <granden> My bad.
[06:01:00] <xec|work> when you are at image 1 and click image 4, do you want to scroll past 2 and 3 or just slide in 4 at once
[06:01:43] <granden> just slide in image 4 at once.
[06:02:02] <xec|work> ok then you can still keep most of this logic
[06:02:22] <granden> hmm
[06:02:23] <xec|work> you just add another check to see if it is left or right
[06:02:47] <xec|work> and maybe start out with image 1 being visible?
[06:03:01] <granden> Yes, image 1 should be visible from the begining.
[06:03:22] <granden> I would like some sort of arrow if possible to slide above the first for images
[06:03:28] <granden> to indicate which one being active
[06:03:34] <granden> maybe not possible?
[06:03:51] <xec|work> anything is possible with a bit of over-engineering
[06:03:56] <xec|work> i am great at that
[06:04:07] <granden> if possible it should, if on img1 pressing img4 it should slide past img2 and img3
[06:04:08] * xec|work looks over his shoulder
[06:04:23] <granden> not just jump directly to img4
[06:04:29] <granden> so kind of both on that one.
[06:04:36] <xec|work> granden: usually i use an "active" class to keep track of what is visible or active at any given time
[06:05:34] <granden> xec|work: Can I pm you with a suggestion?
[06:05:39] <xec|work> granden: if you want to scroll past images you could place all the images beside eachother in one long table row for instance
[06:05:44] <xec|work> and then slide the entire thing
[06:06:04] <xec|work> make each cell the same size as the frame
[06:06:23] <xec|work> find the offset or do some simple math
[06:06:41] <xec|work> i'm just throwing out ideas here ;D
[06:06:52] <granden> yeah, ok to PM you with a suggestion?
[06:07:09] <xec|work> sure why not
[06:07:43] <manuchill> howdy
[06:08:51] <Colin3440> Why is this code: $(".checkbox").on("click", function() { console.log(this); }); giving me this error: TypeError: $(".checkbox").on is not a function. Am I doing something wrong with .on()?
[06:08:58] <shwaiil> Q: I'm having some dificulties in doing a Smooth Horizontal Slide. Can someone have a look in my code and give me some tips on how to achieve this ? I think i'm doing it wrong, I'm using setTimeout and .Animate. It looks very sticky and not smooth, specially when I do this code in image gallery etc. Thanks for looking! http://jsfiddle.net/QRq3y/37/
[06:09:12] <xec|work> Colin3440: what version of jquery are you using?
[06:09:17] <manuchill> does anyone know a nice scroller which scrolls a bunch of listitems from right to left based on requestanimationframe && jquery?
[06:09:42] <Colin3440> the newest
[06:09:55] <Colin3440> oh wait i might not.
[06:10:36] <Colin3440> yeah that was the problem. nevermind
[06:12:22] <shwaiil> manuchill: I'm writting my own, but there's smooth div scroll, try google with this keywords.
[06:14:56] <manuchill> shwaiil, thx will have a look at it
[06:16:45] <BigWings> does anyone know of a good online editor that I can use to design layout elements for my webpage?
[06:17:12] <BigWings> something where I can draw a div with the mouse, add styles to it easily etc etc
[06:17:18] <shwaiil> BigWings: http://speckyboy.com/2010/01/11/10-completely-free-wireframe-and-mockup-applications/
[06:17:27] <BigWings> I have been looking around and can't find anything good
[06:17:42] <johnkpaul> BigWings: what do you define as good?
[06:18:00] <shwaiil> BigWings: you should check some articles and do more testing. Sometimes, you have to stick with what's available and what works better
[06:18:05] <johnkpaul> there's nothing that will always be of high fidelity, WYSIWYG's aren't that good
[06:18:29] <shwaiil> OBS: About my last question on Smooth Scrolling, I've done a quick update. Any tips will still be appreciated, thank for looking http://jsfiddle.net/QRq3y/38/
[06:18:56] <BigWings> i can't find something where I can just draw a div, then draw one inside that, tell it to stick to the border of the parent, etc etc
[06:19:11] <BigWings> but it looks like I might have missed the 'wireframe' keyword
[06:19:14] <johnkpaul> I think that dreamweaver will do that, but you'll have to learn all how to use it, BigWings
[06:19:24] <Whirl3d> Adobe has a new app coming out that will do that. YOu can download it for free right now
[06:20:05] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: brackets?
[06:20:13] <johnkpaul> or edge?
[06:20:44] <johnkpaul> or neither? I should keep more track of adobe's offerings
[06:20:49] <Whirl3d> No I don't think it is either of those. I just downloaded it let me check
[06:20:53] <BigWings> Whirl3d: which one?
[06:21:45] <branant> I've got some nested ul's in my nav menu: <ul><li>Item 1<ul><li>1</li></ul></li></ul>
[06:22:03] <branant> How can I select ALL children of ul li
[06:22:15] <johnkpaul> gho5t: just saw this in the html5 weekly and thought you'd be interested http://buildnewgames.com/taming-the-svg-beast/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email
[06:22:20] <raj> johnkpaul, are you a jquery-ui user?
[06:22:22] <johnkpaul> ?children @branant
[06:22:22] <bot-t> branant, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[06:22:35] <Whirl3d> Adobe Muse
[06:22:50] <johnkpaul> raj: on ocassion, yes
[06:22:56] <Whirl3d> http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/muse/
[06:22:58] <branant> johnkpaul: but for that I need 'this' correct?
[06:23:00] <johnkpaul> ah, thanks Whirl3d
[06:23:07] <Lundy> Hi guys, iv got a jquery shoutbox which looks for new posts ever XXX seconds and also got one to check for online users. But these are doing lots of requests.... is there anyway I can cut down on "bandwith" requests all the time?
[06:23:37] <johnkpaul> branant: what do you mean? $("ul li").children() will give you all of the immediate children
[06:23:58] <branant> johnkpaul: even though there is many li's inside the ul
[06:24:01] <Lundy> when I look at it in FireBug i just see a mass list of requests scrolling for days lol !!!! there must be a better way
[06:24:12] <Whirl3d> of course flash 6 is supposed toassemble into html5, but I'll believe it when I see it.
[06:24:13] <raj> johnkpaul, I'm dealing with an error I can't figure out
[06:24:14] <johnkpaul> Lundy: decrease the time between retrys?
[06:24:36] <johnkpaul> Lundy: or add some logic that will slowly decrease the time logarithmically until a new post is found
[06:25:00] <johnkpaul> ?tias @branant
[06:25:01] <bot-t> branant, Try It And See
[06:25:11] <Lundy> johnkpaul: that would only slow down the speed off the shoutbox... i kinda what it "instant" like Facebook chat
[06:25:24] <johnkpaul> raj: what's the error, are you using the unminified jquery ui?
[06:25:33] <branant> johnkpaul: Ah thanks, tried it, doesn't work.
[06:25:37] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/EfRfY/1/ if you: 1) click the `+` sign 2) drag Tab 1 to the third position 3) click `X` on Tab 3 4) click `X` on Tab 4, you'll see the error
[06:25:41] <branant> johnkpaul: what else you got :)
[06:25:53] <johnkpaul> branant: can you make a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do
[06:25:57] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @branant
[06:25:57] <bot-t> branant, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS.

[06:26:05] <branant> yup will do one sec
[06:26:08] <johnkpaul> raj: :D you need to start looking into unit testing
[06:26:26] <johnkpaul> I hate having to go through so many steps to reproduce an issue
[06:26:32] <Lundy> johnkpaul: do you know how I could make it INSTANT like facebook chat but keep bandwith down ?
[06:26:45] <johnkpaul> Lundy: websockets?
[06:26:49] <raj> johnkpaul, it just sounds long cuz I broke it up so much!
[06:26:54] <johnkpaul> is there some reason that you're worried about bandwidth
[06:27:07] <raj> essentially, it's removing the wrong form, it seems
[06:27:23] <raj> the form from Tab 1 is still present
[06:27:42] <raj> (noticeable if you write some text in the textboxes)
[06:27:43] <johnkpaul> raj: switch to using the unminified jquery ui
[06:27:51] <johnkpaul> at least then you can read the code around where the error is thrown
[06:28:13] <EdwardIII> harrumph
[06:28:36] <johnkpaul> Lundy: I don't know all of the math behind this, but I have seen successful implementations of "real time" chats that update in a logarithmic fashion, down to some lower limit
[06:28:39] <EdwardIII> does $(this, 'ul') mean the object 'this' AND all 'ul' tags? i don't think it does, seems to be something to do with context but can't find the right doc
[06:29:15] <Lundy> johnkpaul: not so much, just would rather help the server cut down like the load and generally speed up the site
[06:29:27] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: I don't believe that there is an option for the second argument to be a string
[06:29:35] <johnkpaul> ?jquery @EdwardIII
[06:29:45] <johnkpaul> does that not work, bot-t
[06:29:47] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[06:29:51] <raj> johnkpaul, http://jsfiddle.net/EfRfY/3/
[06:30:03] <EdwardIII> ahhh
[06:30:28] <gho5t> johnkpaul: i left last night before i saw if you had responded to my svg manipulation issue. any luck?
[06:30:40] <johnkpaul> Lundy: I'd be very surprised if small bits of text are impacting your bandwidth unless you have many many users, what is your interval time now?
[06:30:55] <johnkpaul> gho5t: I didn't try, I just came across that link in my morning reading
[06:31:15] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: mm, so $(this).find('some-elem') vs $('some-elem', this)?
[06:31:21] <smykes> stupid question time: can you load an image into a variable?
[06:31:24] <gho5t> which link?
[06:31:49] <johnkpaul> raj: so trace in the debugger backwards to find out where $show.length comes from
[06:32:09] <Whirl3d> smykes, you can load an image without attaching it to the dom by storing a reference to it in a variable.  yes
[06:32:10] <johnkpaul> gho5t: http://buildnewgames.com/taming-the-svg-beast/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email
[06:32:34] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: they are equivalent in functionality, but .find() is faster
[06:32:42] <gho5t> ah thanks
[06:32:46] <smykes> Whirl3d not sure that will solve my problem, but it's worth a try
[06:32:57] <johnkpaul> smykes: what do you mean "into a variable"
[06:33:02] <Whirl3d> what's your problem?
[06:33:06] <johnkpaul> into a dom object?
[06:33:11] <johnkpaul> you can create a new img tag, and set the src
[06:33:15] <johnkpaul> or you can create a new javascript image object
[06:33:22] <johnkpaul> ?g javascript Image() constructor @smykes
[06:33:24] <bot-t> smykes, DevGuru JavaScript OBJECT: Image - http://www.devguru.com/technologies/ecmascript/quickref/image.html
[06:33:43] <sahbeewah> Lundy: are you using long polling?
[06:33:48] <Lundy> johnkpaul:    setTimeout('waitForMsg()',  2000);
[06:33:58] <raj> johnkpaul, where do you see $show.length?
[06:34:00] <smykes> Whirl3d I'm making a service call for a url to an image, and I have to get the height and width of it and I think on first load its trying to get the height and width before the image is in place
[06:34:04] <Lundy> sahbeewah: I do not know what that is
[06:34:33] <Lundy> ?jsfiddle
[06:34:34] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:34:35] <johnkpaul> raj: did you read through the code where the error is thrown?
[06:35:19] <Lundy> I know this isnt the cleanest but its been working for me .... http://jsfiddle.net/ymt9a/
[06:35:20] <raj> ah, i see
[06:35:20] <sahbeewah> so with long polling you reduce the amount of request dramatically, by increasing the timeout of the request
[06:35:35] <sahbeewah> so it just waits there, and you can get like an instant response, like how facebook does it
[06:35:43] <Whirl3d> smykes, what I do is this:  I create a javascript image object, load the image, setup a load handler that records the h and width
[06:36:04] <smykes> Whirl3d now that might work
[06:36:28] <Whirl3d> var image=new Image(); var img=$(image); img.load(successHandler).error(errorHandler).attr("src", url);
[06:37:00] <Whirl3d> but the next step you have to do is:   if (image.complete) loadSuccess(image);
[06:37:23] <Lundy> sahbeewah: how would I do that ?
[06:37:29] <Whirl3d> "loadSuccess" is the loadhandler. That fires in case the image is cached in IE
[06:38:09] <dethkrieg> General coding question: At work we have no structure or documentation in place on how to code so each of my projects is completely different thant he last one, no consistency. It agitates me but I feel I can't fix this. How to deal with this?
[06:38:18] <sahbeewah> i was experimenting with it the other day http://sahbeewah.com/chat
[06:38:18] <dethkrieg> It's web dev
[06:38:27] <smykes> Whirl3d ok I'm going to try this
[06:38:29] <sahbeewah> i don't think it scales very well though
[06:38:47] <sahbeewah> since i'm using a lamp stack on a shared host
[06:39:24] <quicksilver> it scales perfectly well if you're using the right server-side technology.
[06:39:34] <johnkpaul> sahbeewah: did you use any php library to help with the server side of comet?
[06:39:40] <quicksilver> but there are quite a lot of interesting choices and trade-offs
[06:39:50] <Lundy> sahbeewah: coiuld I pm you ?
[06:39:53] <quicksilver> and also, different approaches work best with different browsers :(
[06:40:03] <sahbeewah> no i just wrote it in plain php
[06:40:09] <sahbeewah> +ajax+jquery
[06:40:26] <smykes> Whirl3d is the IE portion in one of the call backs?
[06:41:22] <smykes> Whirl3d like this? http://pastebin.com/NM8ywGeM
[06:41:34] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: if .find is faster how come jquery doesn't use it internally for handling context?
[06:41:57] <raj> johnkpaul, I dunno, really not able to figure this one out
[06:42:09] <raj> I tried breaking on // show new tab and stepping backwards
[06:42:11] <raj> but that didn't work
[06:43:07] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: I don't know the details tbh, my guess is that when explicitly using .find() some assumptions can be made that work has already been done
[06:43:19] <johnkpaul> it would be interesting to go through the source and understand it though, I just haven't taken the time
[06:43:32] <EdwardIII> agreed
[06:43:32] <johnkpaul> raj: you're adding the break point to your code?
[06:43:50] <gho5t> johnkpaul: setting "null" as the namespace works. Not sure why explicitly setting it didn't work, unless it was the wrong namespace: http://jsfiddle.net/4eqEC/10/
[06:44:01] <raj> to jquery-ui.js
[06:46:05] <johnkpaul> raj: ok, so do you know where the variable $show is set?
[06:47:07] <johnkpaul> gho5t: I don't know, but I'm glad you got it working!
[06:47:16] <johnkpaul> and taught me how to use SVG in the process ;)
[06:47:33] <gho5t> yeah that was my intent : )
[06:48:39] <Whirl3d> smykes, sorry. one minute
[06:50:40] <smykes> Whirl3d im trying a slightly different way i found
[06:50:41] <raj> johnkpaul, it's an anonymous function( clicked, $hide, $show ) on line 11373
[06:50:53] <smykes> using load
[06:51:11] <raj> oh, no, sorry--> $show = self.element.find( self._sanitizeSelector( el.hash ) );
[06:51:16] <shoky> a
[06:51:32] <voot545> anyone know of a CDN that hosts jQuery with Access-Control-Allow-Origin?
[06:51:33] <johnkpaul> ok raj, good, so what is el.hash?
[06:52:22] <raj> this.anchors.bind( o.event + ".tabs", function() {var el=this,...}
[06:52:52] <smykes> Whirl3d trying this
[06:52:52] <smykes> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/02/preload-images-with-jquery.html
[06:53:28] <johnkpaul> raj: I don't know what that last line was for, but it seems like your problem is that jquery ui tabs are looking up el.hash, and finding nothing
[06:54:16] <Whirl3d> smykes, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7vBNg/
[06:55:06] <raj> i have no idea why that would happens
[06:55:09] <raj> *happen
[06:55:18] <shoky> gho5t: no need for setAttributeNS  : http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4eqEC/11/
[06:55:26] <raj> i'm just calling .tab('remove',somehref)
[06:55:27] <smykes> Whirl3d is the way i pasted in no good?
[06:55:44] <johnkpaul> so raj, find out what el.hash is
[06:55:49] <johnkpaul> by printing it out in the console
[06:55:56] <johnkpaul> and then see if you have already removed that element
[06:56:07] <raj> k
[06:56:22] <gho5t> shoky: what in the hell. no idea why this wasn't working yesterday
[06:56:37] <shoky> yesterday you werent modifying the tspan
[06:56:45] <gho5t> yeah i was
[06:56:57] <shoky> o, i didnt see that
[06:57:36] <gho5t> hrm
[06:57:38] <gho5t> whatevs
[06:57:40] <gho5t> thanks
[06:58:06] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7vBNg/1/
[06:58:14] <Whirl3d> with comments ^^
[06:58:54] <smykes> i see that, rereading now Whirl3d
[06:59:28] <smykes> I don't understand how it preloads the image if it doesn't have the url until the attr after the load
[06:59:41] <Whirl3d> it doesn't
[06:59:50] <Whirl3d> .load for images is only an event handler
[06:59:53] <Whirl3d> it's not loading it
[07:00:07] <Whirl3d> it's just listening for the load event
[07:00:07] <smykes> its just waiting until its in the dom?
[07:00:18] <Whirl3d> it just waits until you give it a src
[07:00:40] <Whirl3d> then, it loads automagically and when complete, fires the load handler
[07:01:00] <Whirl3d> think of it like click...
[07:01:30] <Whirl3d> someting.click(clickhandler)    it waits until a click is made to fire the handler
[07:01:33] <shoky> that last if is necessary?
[07:01:33] <raj> johnkpaul, it gives the id of the body associated with the tab clicked on, nothing to do with removal of a tab
[07:01:40] <Whirl3d> the same is true for load in this context.
[07:01:46] <raj> morning shoky
[07:01:52] <shoky> sup raj
[07:02:16] <Whirl3d> the last if allows for the bug in IE where cached images refuse to fire the load event
[07:02:24] <raj> crappy morning, dealing with issues
[07:02:25] <shoky> ah
[07:02:52] <shoky> better fix those!
[07:03:08] <Whirl3d> It also helps with tiny images that load before the load handler is assinged. but That's why I assing the load handler before the src attribute
[07:03:13] <johnkpaul> raj: ok, does that ID still exist in the dom?
[07:03:22] <smykes> thanks Whirl3d this is unfortunately a kind of urgent fix ill have to go back later and take a deeper liik
[07:03:29] <shoky> Whirl3d yeah, so only for IE bug.. makes sense ;P
[07:03:59] <raj> johnkpaul, nope
[07:04:12] <raj> it removed the wrong ID at some point
[07:04:26] <johnkpaul> ok, then you know what your issue is, raj
[07:04:43] <johnkpaul> so now you have to look through what happens when you click the x
[07:04:45] <raj> hehe, I knew that from the start, but I haven't been able to follow the removal
[07:04:48] <johnkpaul> and see how it ends up in an incorrect state
[07:04:59] <johnkpaul> raj: but now you can, because you have the unminified jquery ui
[07:05:11] <raj> the remove goes through like a million functions
[07:05:14] <gho5t> is it possible to make a jsfiddle private
[07:05:41] <shoky> don't share the link?
[07:06:08] <andr0id> http://fun.regielive.ro/imagini/animale/mai-incet-ce-esti-iepure-15912.html#main that is just f**in funny :D
[07:06:12] <gho5t> do they list them all somewhere
[07:06:40] <shoky> in your user page
[07:07:11] <johnkpaul> raj: it is just code, whether or not it is a million functions
[07:11:51] <EdwardIII> heh if you flick between the elements rapidly the dropdowns fade out: http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/
[07:14:29] <raj> johnkpaul, in fact, when I step through it (I'm alternative btwn pressing Step Over Next Fnctn Call and Step Into Next Fnctn Call, I never get to any .tabs('remove',...) stuff
[07:14:38] <raj> just goes through the jquery selector it seems
[07:15:03] <johnkpaul> raj: you call .tabs('remove,... in your own code, right?
[07:15:08] <johnkpaul> put a breakpoint there, and step into
[07:15:09] <raj> yes
[07:15:23] <raj> k, i did
[07:15:41] <raj> var jQuery = function( selector, context ) {return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );}
[07:17:08] <johnkpaul> raj: step out and step into again
[07:17:16] <johnkpaul> that's the creation of the jquery object on the same line
[07:17:29] <johnkpaul> or put a new line between the creation of the jquery object and .tabs("remove'..
[07:28:36] <zelrik> is there a replacement for jQuery.handleError?
[07:28:43] <zelrik> looks like it was removed
[07:30:38] <zelrik> hello :|
[07:31:47] <shoky> helo
[07:31:57] <shoky> you shouldn't use a global error handler
[07:32:09] <zelrik> it s not me
[07:32:14] <shoky> (unless its your own)
[07:32:14] <zelrik> it s ajaxfileuploader
[07:32:35] <shoky> $.handleError was never a documented function
[07:33:12] <zelrik> which is like the only plugin I found to upload a file
[07:33:40] <shoky> there's http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[07:35:15] <zelrik> how do I install it
[07:36:18] <shoky> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup
[07:39:05] <tifification> if you invoke $.ajax with the async: false option, the line ofter $.ajax should run until after the success callback has run, right?
[07:39:18] <tifification> I mean "shouldnt run"
[07:39:43] <tifification> Or could there be a race between the next line and success?
[07:40:35] <johnkpaul> tifification: assuming that the ajax call _is_ successful, you are correct, the next line will not run until after the success callback has finished
[07:41:09] <tifification> hmm
[07:41:13] <tifification> thx
[07:42:33] <johnkpaul> no problem, tifification
[07:46:41] <zelrik> shoky: it s not using a form anymore is ti
[07:47:16] <shoky> it can use a from
[07:47:56] <stefancrs> hey, if I want to get the bottom of a div, relative to bottom of browser window, how would I go about doing that?
[07:48:04] <stefancrs> this is for lazy loading content as you scroll...
[07:49:01] <lathan> ?hi
[07:49:02] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[07:49:08] <gho5t> position: absolute;
[07:49:23] <gho5t> put relative on the container
[07:49:26] <Jon47> ?position @ stefancrs
[07:49:26] <bot-t> stefancrs, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[07:49:39] <Jon47> wait maybe not that one
[07:49:40] <Jon47> ?offset @ stefancrs
[07:49:41] <bot-t> stefancrs, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:49:55] <stefancrs> sorry, but how does that give me relative to screen?
[07:49:58] <Jon47> and then compare that to $(window).scrollTop()
[07:50:02] <stefancrs> ah ok
[07:50:05] <stefancrs> thanks!
[07:50:08] <Jon47> actually maybe you can just use scrolltop
[07:50:10] <Jon47> ?scrollTop
[07:50:11] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[07:50:45] <Jon47> play around, you should be able to make it work with one of those
[07:52:34] <stefancrs> Jon47: yeah, I should probably be able to use scrollTop + outerHeight on the element at hand...
[07:52:36] <lathan> $(window).scrollTop() - $(item).offset().y should work
[07:53:34] <raj> johnkpaul, I've gotten to the point where (I think) I've pinpointed the issue, but have no idea how to resolve it
[07:53:54] <ShaunR> how can i pull/get the #location section of a url?
[07:53:54] <johnkpaul> ok, what do you think the issue is
[07:54:18] <raj> http://68.46.138.78:8080/testtabs ... again, if you add 1 tab, and then move Tab 1 to position 3, then remove Tab 3 and then Tab 1
[07:54:21] <johnkpaul> ShaunR: window.location.hash
[07:54:24] <raj> you can see it in the console
[07:55:09] <johnkpaul> see what, raj, the error?
[07:55:09] <raj> the removed <li><a> doesn't match the removed form
[07:55:15] <james13433> How can I get an illegal attribute such as price="" ?
[07:56:06] <raj> there are 3 significant console.logs. One is the index, the other is the href of the <a>, and the third is the id of the <form>
[07:56:09] <Jon47> james13433: .attr('price')
[07:56:12] <raj> for each removal, that is
[07:56:13] <Jon47> jquery doesn't care if  it's invalid or not
[07:56:30] <Jon47> why woudl you ask that question in irc instead of just testing it out first
[07:56:41] <james13433> thats what I tried jon but got Nan
[07:57:00] <Jon47> if it's NaN then that's what it's set to
[07:57:07] <raj> but I have no idea why it's removing the wrong index when removing tab 1
[07:57:10] <james13433> I think it because its on a select
[07:57:34] <james13433> so the price="" is atctiuy an attribute for the selected option not the select?
[07:59:13] <stefancrs> lathan: hm, how does that tell me how much of the item that is outside of the screen (at the bottom) ?
[07:59:22] <stefancrs> lathan: if too little is, I want to load more content into it
[07:59:55] <johnkpaul> raj: so continue your debugging
[07:59:56] <stefancrs> lathan: shouldn't I have to use window scrollTop + item offset + item height?
[08:00:04] <johnkpaul> where is el set?
[08:00:06] <stefancrs> (as in a combo of those
[08:00:20] <james13433> jon47 http://jsfiddle.net/M6y7J/
[08:00:24] <raj> johnkpaul, there's no el here
[08:01:24] <zelrik> shoky: is that how it would work: http://pastebin.com/rYzDsmy6 ?
[08:01:41] <johnkpaul> raj: what do you mean? you have a console.log statement printing out el.hash
[08:01:42] <lathan> stefancrs: right, yes, I didn't realize that was what you wanted to do
[08:01:51] <lathan> stefancrs: I came in in the middle of your request
[08:01:57] <shoky> zelrik: i donno, is that what the docs say
[08:02:09] <raj> johnkpaul, oh, but that's just to view a tab
[08:02:16] <raj> i'm trying to debug removal of a tab
[08:02:31] <raj> cuz it's removing the wrong form
[08:02:35] <zelrik> shoky: I glued stuff together from the doc, gonna give it a try
[08:02:37] <raj> the wrong $panel, that is
[08:02:54] <stefancrs> lathan: np :) and it works now and you helped me get there :)
[08:03:37] <NoiseEee> james13433: http://jsfiddle.net/M6y7J/2/
[08:03:43] <raj> i don't understand how the $panel and $li (which I'm printing to the console) have different indexes
[08:03:44] <Jon47> james13433: the (this) in your scenario is the select element, not the option
[08:03:52] <Jon47> so yeah, price is not set
[08:03:54] <raj> that's the root of the problem
[08:03:57] <NoiseEee> james13433: but why wouldn't you be storing the price in the "value" property of your option??
[08:03:57] <raj> that they have different indexes
[08:04:20] <james13433> NoiseEee, its a security issue
[08:04:32] <Jon47> NoiseEee: I could imagine that the prices are set on the backend, and you just pick the index of the price you want to use
[08:04:41] <james13433> indeed
[08:04:41] <NoiseEee> james13433: yeah, uh, and what solution is being provided by having a "price" attribute????
[08:04:52] <Jon47> if you set the price in javascript / html then anybody could just edit the code and pick their own price
[08:05:08] <james13433> NoiseEee the price on the frontend is just so I update the price, as options are selected
[08:05:16] <Jon47> it seems to me like the price should be the text node of the option
[08:05:20] <james13433> the displayed price that is
[08:05:22] <Jon47> "price 1" doesn't really help anybody
[08:05:31] <james13433> No but that would say for example Blue
[08:05:32] <james13433> Red
[08:05:34] <james13433> Yellow
[08:05:34] <chm007> Which book would you recommend about jquery / jquery-ui ?
[08:05:41] <sebumd> Howdy all.  I need to reproduce a site with similar features to this one using jQuery, anybody have an idea?  http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/williamkentridge/flash/
[08:06:45] <sebumd> I see a pretty cool example that uses jQuery.kinetic: http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/DraggableImageBoxesGrid/
[08:06:46] <Jon47> at any rate, you're right NoiseEee, putting it into another attribute isn't any safer than having it as the value, but it probably facilitates communicating with the backend
[08:06:50] <NoiseEee> james13433: at the very least consider using html5 valid "data-" options.  <option value='someUPCCode' data-price="1.45" data-whatever="okay">etc</option>
[08:07:08] <james13433> If I was coding it I would, but its already deep in the cms
[08:07:13] <james13433> from scratch*
[08:07:45] <johnkpaul> raj: so, you are on the right track
[08:07:46] <NoiseEee> right, any price presented anywhere on the front-end of anything is merely for display and can/will be manipulated, so why bother with any front-end fake-security measures regarding price?
[08:07:48] <sebumd> Can any jQuery pros recommend potential plugins that I'd want to use?  We might outsource that project by the way if someone was interested..
[08:07:53] <johnkpaul> you need to find out what the remove funtion is doing
[08:08:01] <raj> i see what it's doing
[08:08:22] <johnkpaul> so why is it removing the incorerct form?
[08:08:29] <james13433> NoiseEee what do you mean by "so why bother with any front-end fake-security measures regarding price?"
[08:08:53] <raj> somehow $li and $panel have different indexes for the same element
[08:09:01] <raj> i mean, for the related elements
[08:09:17] <raj> index = this.anchors.index( this.anchors.filter( "[href$='" + index + "']" ) );
[08:09:32] <james13433> The reason I have the price attribute is so say for example you select Would you like an extra Monitior fro your computer, and I click yes then I can update the whole product price.
[08:09:44] <NoiseEee> james13433: gotcha.
[08:09:49] <johnkpaul> so raj, when you reorder the tabs
[08:09:52] <johnkpaul> do you also reorder the panels?
[08:10:00] <johnkpaul> I mean, when you reorder the $lis, do you reorder the $panels?
[08:10:10] <raj> no
[08:10:14] <raj> the panels are simply referenced
[08:10:26] <raj> by the href in the <a> within the <li>
[08:10:40] <johnkpaul> well from what you described, that could be the problem?
[08:10:47] <johnkpaul> maybe jquery ui assumes that the tabs and then panels are in the same order
[08:11:01] <johnkpaul> and by reordering them, and breaking that assumption, it is acting incorrectly
[08:11:02] <raj> k
[08:11:13] <johnkpaul> raj: I don't know if this is correct, I am making a guess based on what you've told me
[08:11:16] <raj> cool, so how can I resolve?
[08:11:21] <raj> i think you're right
[08:11:35] <johnkpaul> I dont' know how you can resolve, but you know the problem, so you can look for a solution
[08:11:38] <raj> cuz jquery ui isn't reordering the indexes of the panels within the widget
[08:12:22] <raj> i mean within the widget object
[08:12:39] <zelrik> shoky: that's not working at all
[08:13:22] <raj> oh crap http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4524
[08:13:26] <raj> 3 years ago!
[08:13:44] <raj> oh
[08:13:45] <raj> call refresh
[08:13:48] <raj> :)
[08:13:53] <raj> ...testing
[08:17:23] <shoky> zelrik: i dont really know what you're doing or trying to do
[08:17:28] <sebumd> Anyone have any solution to my issue?
[08:17:51] <sebumd> or specific plugin recommendations
[08:23:50] <shoky> raj you're using 1.9?
[08:24:13] <raj> shoky, 1.8.20
[08:24:13] <zelrik> shoky: fileupload is not a function
[08:24:20] <zelrik> shoky: that s the error I get now
[08:24:28] <shoky> raj then how're you calling refresh?
[08:24:32] <raj> damn, that explains that
[08:24:38] <shoky> :D
[08:25:15] <shoky> zelrik: from what i remember you need to call .fileupload() on a jquery object
[08:25:28] <raj> woulda been here for another 2 hours before I realized that
[08:25:31] <shoky> that is the form or the fileinput
[08:25:38] <zelrik> shoky: I did
[08:25:46] <shoky> you did $.fileupload  no/
[08:25:47] <shoky> ?
[08:26:00] <zelrik> I fixed that since then
[08:26:07] <shoky> k so dono ;p
[08:26:07] <raj> haha, you're a fileupload master
[08:26:16] <shoky> thanks to my fileupload buddy ;)
[08:26:22] <raj> haha ;)
[08:26:32] <zelrik> I also added some files that were missing
[08:26:43] <zelrik> iframe transport and ui widgets
[08:27:04] <shoky> ?paste
[08:27:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:27:24] <DaveJ|UK> I have found a strange but with jquery .append(). If I do $('#fslot1').append('Test'); I don't get anything, but if I put an alert box before it then it works. Am I being dumb or is this likely to be a bug?
[08:27:29] <DaveJ|UK> bug*
[08:27:46] <shoky> most likely the former
[08:27:51] <DaveJ|UK> heh
[08:27:54] <shoky> ;p
[08:28:18] <DaveJ|UK> $('#fslot1').length indicates that it exists
[08:28:21] <raj> how can I get the latest version of 1.9?
[08:28:24] <DaveJ|UK> i cant think what else the probl;em could be
[08:28:27] <raj> jquery-ui
[08:28:40] <ryanneufeld> ?append @ DaveJ|UK
[08:28:40] <bot-t> DaveJ|UK, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[08:29:15] <shoky> raj maybe http://view.jqueryui.com/1.9m7/
[08:29:45] <shoky> http://view.jqueryui.com/ usually has latest stuff  afaik
[08:30:10] <DaveJ|UK> appendTo() does exactly the same
[08:30:17] <EdwardIII> hey
[08:30:30] <EdwardIII> is there a way to make something opaque so it works in IE8?
[08:30:35] <shoky> ?paste @ DaveJ|UK
[08:30:35] <bot-t> DaveJ|UK, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:30:40] <zelrik> shoky: http://pastebin.com/AjZZTSwb
[08:30:44] <EdwardIII> but not as part of an animation, just, "strait up, make this opaque, no messing"
[08:32:23] <EdwardIII> just setting .css({opacity: '0'}) doesn't working in IE8, which kinda makes sense
[08:33:21] <shoky> zelrik: i think you're supposed to call .fileupload before the submit occurs
[08:33:33] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: that should work, jquery glosses over the differences in syntax for you
[08:33:35] <shoky> it's supposed to catch the submit on its own
[08:33:43] <shoky> or if you manually submit
[08:33:43] <johnkpaul> perhaps your element does not "have" layout
[08:33:44] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: hrm, it doesn't though heh
[08:33:59] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html
[08:34:08] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: tried that too
[08:34:14] <raj> shoky, it's pretty different, not sure this would be a good idea (in case it breaks everything else of mine)
[08:35:40] <raj> actually, they only have a jquery.ui.tabs.js
[08:35:50] <raj> i'm using a combined version of all the js files
[08:35:55] <raj> "custom" so to speak
[08:36:47] <zelrik> shoky: not sure what you mean
[08:36:54] <raj> would it be foolish of me to forego a single file and instead individualize all the components?
[08:37:40] <shoky> only in production i guess
[08:37:54] <vl1234> hi hi i am getting error message from java program like that...........<%String failed=(String)request.getAttribute("failed"); 	if(StringUtils.isNotEmpty(failed)){	out.println(failed);}%>......i need is how to display this message in popup using jquery
[08:38:28] <shoky> zelrik: which setup example are you following
[08:38:31] <raj> ok, then follow up question, do you think it's possible to pull off line 168 forward within my page's code? http://view.jqueryui.com/1.9m7/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js
[08:38:47] <raj> or would that have to be in jquery-ui.js ?
[08:38:54] <zelrik> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[08:39:00] <raj> as in, can I customly "refresh"
[08:39:08] <zelrik> I have a form instead of a simple input
[08:40:18] <shoky> raj i wouldnt pull off functions from there, but that bug ticket you posted has some workarounds no?
[08:40:58] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: here's a test case that doesn't work in ie8: http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/3/
[08:41:51] <shoky> zelrik: so you see how he calls .fileupload  in the dom-ready handler.. not just on form submission
[08:41:59] <Blindie> hello, is there any plugin ore tutorial to make en page transition like this? http://www.thisisbliss.com/
[08:42:06] <Blindie> i mean only the fade effect
[08:42:10] <raj> thanks shoky, overlooked the workaround
[08:42:16] <raj> i'll give that a shot
[08:42:21] <shoky> gluck ;>
[08:42:40] <raj> btw, johnkpaul, thanks for walking me through the debugging
[08:42:45] <raj> much appreciated :)
[08:43:11] <EdwardIII> also if i'm going about this in a stupid way, feel free to correct me anyone!
[08:43:39] <shoky> i also had some opacity issues in IE8 that i havent solved yet
[08:43:47] <shoky> i so dont feel like getting into that :\
[08:43:50] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: I don't have ievms setup on my current machine yet, so I don't have immediate access to ie8, but I'll put it through browsershots
[08:44:02] <johnkpaul> raj: no problem, I am glad that you worked through it
[08:44:29] <EdwardIII> shoky: heh, like a raincloud of cross-browser pain
[08:44:33] <shoky> :(
[08:44:55] <EdwardIII> actually i should point out i'm testing with ie9 in ie8 mode
[08:45:16] <johnkpaul> oh, EdwardIII, I don't know if I'd trust that
[08:45:22] <johnkpaul> just use the ms official vms
[08:46:00] <zelrik> shoky: you mean the $(function () { part ?
[08:46:00] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: looks like it works in ie7
[08:46:06] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: http://browsershots.org/screenshots/17837da434ad0d2ff5ff560e3b31c13e
[08:47:01] <EdwardIII> okie doke, time to close everything to get some mem for ievm heh
[08:47:24] <shoky> zelrik: yea
[08:47:40] <zelrik> hm
[08:47:47] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: http://browsershots.org/http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/3/show/# if you want to keep track as ie8 is finished
[08:47:49] <zelrik> that part I dont understand actually
[08:48:15] <shoky> $( function() { ... } )   <--- that?
[08:48:34] <shoky> that's exactly the same as  $(document).ready( function() { ... } )
[08:49:01] <zelrik> ok
[08:49:07] <zelrik> I have to put that somewhere
[08:49:10] <zelrik> in my js
[08:49:29] <shoky> yes.. mm. do you know jquery? :)
[08:49:35] <EdwardIII> there must be a tutorial somewhere for this man
[08:49:48] <zelrik> shoky: I am learning as  I go
[08:49:52] <Blindie> is there an plugin for crossfade page transition?
[08:50:11] <shoky> zelrik: learn at least the basics before attempting to use plugins
[08:50:15] <Guest5445> hi, I'm having a little problem with jquery: http://pastebin.com/3x7dwr0w this works correctly when the page is loaded the first time/refreshed, but it doesn't work anymore when you access that same page through an ajax call..I'm currently playing with the delegate method and it partially works, I just can't get the href value: http://pastebin.com/N2gncWFt any hint? (it's in coffee)
[08:50:37] <zelrik> shoky: not enough time ^^
[08:50:43] <shoky> zelrik: otherwise how would you understand the plugin examples
[08:51:34] <shoky> if you dont have enough time to learn the basics then anything further would be a waste of what time you do have
[08:52:05] <shoky> i'm not saying go through the whole API docs
[08:52:06] <zelrik> shoky: I thought I understood the basics
[08:52:21] <rudraram> how to create hover appear menus?
[08:52:27] <Eviltwin> Guest5445: I don't think most people here read CoffeeScript so I'd recommend compiling it to JavaScript
[08:52:30] <zelrik> but there are still basic things I am stuck on
[08:52:31] <Eviltwin> For the paste
[08:52:34] <Eviltwin> Or put in both
[08:52:45] <EdwardIII> johnkpaul: i don't get it, i'm testing that fiddle here in ie8 on an ievm from MS and it's not working heh
[08:53:01] <shoky> zelrik: oks. so i'd suggest putting that document ready handler in your script and calling the .fileupload from inside it
[08:53:11] <shoky> like he does in the example
[08:53:38] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: hmm, I don't know, that's very odd
[08:53:50] <johnkpaul> I'd be very surprised if it worked in ie7 and _not_ ie8

[08:54:25] <Ecchi> Hello guys, I have a newbie question that I already asked in javascript channel, but you seem more active so I'll ask it here too
[08:55:12] <Ecchi> I'd like to be able to expand/collapse tags on my wordpress blog, so I'm about to use code like this: http://andrijeski.net/jstest/poisample.html
[08:55:27] <Ecchi> but if I add more content/divs only one is displayed.
[08:55:51] <Ecchi> since the posts and tags are generated, I don't know how to insert different id's for each div
[08:55:58] <Ecchi> any nice way to solve this?
[08:56:25] <shoky> EdwardIII: that seems like the same issue i had
[08:56:42] <shoky> opacity on doc load didnt have any effect
[08:56:47] <shoky> only afterwards
[08:56:52] <shoky> hmm
[08:57:17] <rudraram> http://themeforest.net/item/auzora-one-page-portfolio-and-business-theme/full_screen_preview/102832  ------ how to create these kind of menus?
[08:57:21] <zelrik> shoky: another thing I dont understand is why there is not submit button in that example
[08:57:49] <rudraram> +bot-t: thanks but i want the menus like in the link      http://themeforest.net/item/auzora-one-page-portfolio-and-business-theme/full_screen_preview/102832
[08:58:20] <shoky> zelrik: by default, that plugin sends the files as soon as you select them
[08:58:29] <rudraram> ryanneufeld: ya like in the link       http://themeforest.net/item/auzora-one-page-portfolio-and-business-theme/full_screen_preview/102832
[08:58:45] <shoky> zelrik: if you dont want it to do that you need to override the 'add' callback
[09:00:29] <EdwardIII> shoky: doesn't seem to make a difference whether it's onload or afterwards (see the oink button): http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/4/
[09:01:15] <Ecchi> -.-
[09:02:27] <EdwardIII> looking through the jQuery source to see how fadeIn works, but all i can spot is: fadeIn: { opacity: "show" },
[09:02:40] <zelrik> shoky: I keep getting the same error
[09:05:22] <EdwardIII> actually looks like jquery might even apply that itself sometimes: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L207
[09:05:50] <raj> welp, that still doesn't work http://68.46.138.78:8080/testtabs
[09:06:39] <EdwardIII> ah, think i'm going to go home heh
[09:06:44] <EdwardIII> thanks for all your help guys
[09:07:29] <raj> in fact
[09:07:34] <raj> it looks like it's worse
[09:07:43] <raj> what kinda bs
[09:08:33] <Dr4g> it's not entering my loop, wtf ?
[09:08:37] <Dr4g> for(i = 0; i < response.content.length; i++) {
[09:08:42] <Dr4g> response.content.length is 12
[09:09:59] <shoky> then it's probably entering the loop
[09:13:39] <zelrik> shoky: actually, I don't see fileupload defined anywhere in the plugin files
[09:14:38] <Dr4g> shoky: console.log(i); is doing nothing in the loop
[09:14:50] <shoky> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/5/
[09:15:11] <shoky> ?paste @ Dr4g
[09:15:11] <bot-t> Dr4g, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:15:45] <shoky> if you do console.log(response.content.length) on the line before the 'for' , it writes 12?
[09:15:49] <explodes> Is there any way to disable input on an input field while still submitting the data?
[09:16:18] <explodes> I've seen it on comcasts website where you use "shipping info for billing info" and the fields are disabled
[09:16:26] <Dr4g> shoky: it would appear that Mustache.render() call within the loop is breaking execution, with no errors logged to the console. Pasting now.
[09:16:57] <shoky> within the loop?
[09:17:02] <shoky> you said it wasn't entered
[09:17:33] <Dr4g> it's entering, hitting mustache call and stopp execution
[09:17:44] <Dr4g> https://gist.github.com/d2570122b3e48ebcd9f1
[09:17:45] <shoky> so it's entering, problem solved
[09:20:19] <Dr4g> shoky: problem not solved. execution is halting on the mustache call
[09:20:22] <Dr4g> with nothing in error log
[09:21:06] <shoky> original problem solved
[09:21:11] <shoky> now you have a mustache problem?
[09:21:22] <Dr4g> it would appear so.

[09:22:54] <shoky> zelrik: are you intentionally putting the document ready handler inside another function?
[09:23:26] <zelrik> shoky: I am putting it in the function that loads the apge
[09:23:29] <zelrik> page*
[09:23:45] <shoky> why
[09:24:14] <zelrik> you told me it should defined before I use it
[09:24:35] <shoky> don't put it in another function
[09:24:57] <shoky> i told you what should be defined?
[09:25:39] <zelrik> gah I am lost now
[09:25:47] <zelrik> where that thing should go
[09:25:55] <shoky> just follow the example
[09:26:00] <shoky> same place as he put it
[09:26:23] <shoky> or just in some <script> that's inside the <head> part
[09:26:34] <zelrik> ok

[09:26:50] <shoky> O_O
[09:29:01] <james13433> Where can i store json data that I have retrieved via ajax for use later on ? for example on change
[09:29:44] <shoky> in a variable, or you can use .data() on a dom element
[09:31:13] <zelrik> shoky: if I put it outside, it will be loaded before I even define #fileupload though
[09:34:29] <shoky> when do you define it
[09:34:54] <OverMyHead> Is it possible I can get someone to take a quick glance at a site to see if there's an obvious jQuery conflict or something of that nature? I'm pretty lost right now
[09:35:10] <shoky> not so far
[09:35:11] <rhizmoe> actual questions would help
[09:35:21] <zelrik> shoky: when I load the page with that function I showed you
[09:35:37] <zelrik> which is in a prototype
[09:35:54] <OverMyHead> sure Rhizmoe -- basically I'm trying to use a calendar plugin, and it won't work with just this theme... works with every other theme. link: http://goo.gl/WLo1M
[09:36:02] <shoky> zelrik:  generateProfileDiv()  creates the #fileupload element ?
[09:36:19] <zelrik> yeah
[09:36:30] <OverMyHead> rhizmoe: It should have an event that shows on the 1st and 15th, as well as a small popup on mouse hover when going over dates with events
[09:36:50] <shoky> zelrik: ok so remove the document ready handler and just call .fileupload inside there
[09:36:56] <james13433> how would I store in a variable with the id a element.
[09:37:45] <shoky> zelrik: like this http://pastebin.com/Ja9D5Sri
[09:38:13] <shoky> james13433: what?

[09:38:39] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: http://browsershots.org/screenshots/f702fd17dbd7f8793f736a7f6bf341d5 apparently it is not working in ie8
[09:38:43] <johnkpaul> I don't know why though
[09:38:59] <shoky> jkp
[09:39:19] <shoky> it works if you set the opacity of the <li>s
[09:39:28] <shoky> instead of the containing <ul>
[09:39:43] <shoky> as in http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/5/
[09:39:55] <johnkpaul> ah ok, shoky, thanks
[09:40:10] <johnkpaul> I wonder why though, ul is block level and has layout and all that jazz
[09:40:23] <shoky> IE8 is MS and all that jazz
[09:40:37] <shoky> haslayout or not ;p
[09:42:43] <Dr4g> Anyone here used/using Mustache.js ? I have an issue that i'm looking to get help with.
[09:44:23] <johnkpaul> shoky: sure, but which one! :) http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html
[09:44:49] <shoky> hehh
[09:44:58] <shoky> it's simple: there is only one MS
[09:57:02] <gho5t> Dr4g: i am.
[09:57:21] <Dr4g> gho5t: have you tried the conditional block yet?   {{#someVar} ... {{/someVar}
[09:57:31] <gho5t> yeah
[09:58:00] <Dr4g> gho5t: did you try it with just a standard boolean (someVar) or was someVar here a list (array) ?
[09:58:30] <gho5t> i've done it with a boolean
[09:59:04] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use tinymce?
[09:59:34] <gho5t> both actually
[09:59:41] <Dr4g> gho5t: https://gist.github.com/ea4a661f6c64e1b0ae55 <-- my template
[10:00:04] <Dr4g> when mustache finds {{/showPriceRange}}, it gives me this error "Section named "showPriceRange" was never opened"
[10:00:22] <Dr4g> I'm using mustache exports.version = "0.5.0-dev";
[10:01:07] <gho5t> the way you have it looks right but you didn't close {{ title }} above correctly
[10:01:17] <james13433> So in my example, http://jsfiddle.net/AjnD4/ that works if I only have one partNumber, however I need to have multiple partNumbers, each with there own products that can be got later with onChange. How do I do that?
[10:02:00] <Dr4g> gho5t: your second pair of eyes are genius :D
[10:02:06] <gho5t> indeed : )

[10:26:57] <acodispo> Hello all.
[10:27:03] <acodispo> I am trying to use the unload event to hold a page until ajax has finished executing. The specific case is that I send data to the server via ajax whenever I get a 'blur' event on an INPUT. Unfortunately, clicking a link on the page (to load another page) triggers the blur event but the ajax doesn't usually have enough time to finish. I get a 'prompt aborted by user' JS error. Any ideas?
[10:28:51] <gho5t> when you fire the ajax you could disable the default behavior of all anchors, and then re-enable them when the ajax completes
[10:29:29] <melle> acodispo: Nice: Rethink your approach. Nasty: Add onclick events to all anchor elements and postpone the actual event
[10:31:29] <Dreamer3> does query have a built in a way i can quickly determine if i'm being passed a string or jquery result?
[10:31:33] <james13433> If I have "products":[{"color":"Black"},{"color":"Blue"},{"color":"White"}] how do I get at each of the values?
[10:31:46] <Dreamer3> so my function can take either an ID or a jquery object
[10:31:47] <james13433> I'm being dumb probably but It doesn't want to work
[10:32:43] <james13433> if I just alert it I get [object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
[10:32:49] <acodispo> gho5t, melle: I tried disabling default behavior on anchors, but don't like the thought of users clicking uselessly till the ajax finishes. I tried async: false but that had the same result (clicks did nothing until Ajax was finished). Is there a way to delay or postpone the anchor's behavior, then execute it when the ajax is done?
[10:32:49] <johnkpaul> Dr4g: check for the .jquery property
[10:32:56] <johnkpaul> Dreamer3: ^^
[10:33:06] <Dreamer3> hmmm

[10:39:27] <granden> Anyone?
[10:39:28] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGda/74/
[10:39:32] <granden> who could help me?
[10:41:25] <melle> acodispo: let the anchors write to some sort of queue, which is processed after the ajax request has completed (using a callback)
[10:42:06] <acodispo> melle: Okay, I think I get that. Thanks!
[10:42:43] <melle> acodispo: yw
[10:43:02] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGda/75/ Anyone please? Really need some help.
[10:43:11] <granden> The background, why aint it fading in?
[10:44:28] <melle> james13433: if the key is known (per your example "color") you could use sth like for (var i in products) { alert(products[i]['color']); }

[10:48:05] <shoky> .each( function() { $(this).on(....
[10:48:19] <ajpiano> ...
[10:48:23] <Keith___> Yes I would prefer not to use this
[10:48:31] <shoky> or just .on, yes ;)
[10:48:32] <Keith___> it can be ambiguous
[10:48:48] <ajpiano> Keith___: you don't need to use .each() to bind a handler to everything in the set... .on implicitly iterates the set
[10:49:19] <shoky> it can be confusing, not ambiguous
[10:49:22] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGda/78/
[10:49:24] <granden> solved it.
[10:49:35] <Keith___> right...
[10:49:38] <granden> shoky: For some reason yours did not work
[10:49:48] <granden> but I solved the problem
[10:49:54] <granden> now there is only one really irretating bug.
[10:49:57] <shoky> granden: mine worked, all i did was remove the overflow:hidden to show you that the fading is working fine
[10:50:04] <granden> ah
[10:50:06] <Jon47> Keith: if you insist.. .each( function(el) { $(el).on(.... it does the same thing as
[10:50:08] <shoky> it was the position that was the problem
[10:50:14] <granden> shoky: Ok
[10:50:18] <granden> I see
[10:50:22] <granden> But I got one bug left
[10:50:43] <shoky> Jon47: function(index, el)
[10:50:47] <granden> If I run this in safari
[10:50:52] <granden> or some versions of chrome

[10:51:18] <granden> it does not slide out/in from the correct side of the div.
[10:51:19] <Jon47> shoky: touche, my bad
[10:51:31] <granden> Seams to be some problem with margin-left:-100% in safari
[10:51:35] <granden> anyone have had the same problem?
[10:51:37] <shoky> granden: works on my chrome ;p
[10:51:51] <granden> Yeah, just some special versions seams like it, but safari dont work
[10:51:53] <granden> and that is a must
[10:52:19] <ProLoser|Work> your FACE is a must

[10:52:50] <granden> ProLoser|Work: Haha ;)
[10:53:04] <ProLoser|Work> what's the issue?
[10:53:06] <rosieres> At the moment Chrome throws a unknown identifier . . .
[10:53:26] <ProLoser|Work> rosieres: break it up into more lines and figure out where
[10:53:36] <ProLoser|Work> and uh
[10:53:39] <ProLoser|Work> you have a syntax error
[10:53:44] <ProLoser|Work> on the last line
[10:53:51] <ProLoser|Work> BOOYA
[10:54:09] <shoky> rosieres: you're missing a few pluses
[10:54:13] <ProLoser|Work> you would have known that if you were awesome like me
[10:54:21] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGda/78/ - any idea why the slider wont work in Safari?
[10:54:23] <rosieres> ;-)
[10:55:22] <ProLoser|Work> granden: wfm
[10:55:27] <granden> ?
[10:55:32] <ProLoser|Work> works for me
[10:55:46] <ProLoser|Work> sorta
[10:55:48] <ProLoser|Work> weird
[10:55:51] <ProLoser|Work> what's it doing wrong?
[10:56:10] <granden> ProLoser|Work: If you go the the image most to right
[10:56:13] <granden> the yellow one
[10:56:15] <rosieres> shoky or ProLoser: THx . . . parent().find() should be right ? why do i get a NAN ?
[10:56:16] <granden> and then click on the black
[10:56:18] <smykes> In JQUI the date picker seems to send 4:00 AM as a time, is there a way to change that so it sends current time?
[10:56:22] <ProLoser|Work> ya i am noticing that
[10:56:24] <ProLoser|Work> it's trippy heh
[10:56:34] <granden> it slides in  and out wrong
[10:56:36] <granden> any ideas why?
[10:56:46] <ProLoser|Work> rosieres: break your code up into smaller peices so you can debug each function call individually
[10:56:48] <ProLoser|Work> instead of guessing
[10:57:00] <granden> ProLoser|Work: Understand the bug? Any idea of solution?
[10:57:38] <raj> shoky, guess what, that workaround fixed the exact case I had, but there are an infinite number of other random cases that cause the same error
[10:57:57] <ProLoser|Work> granden: why are you coding it like that?
[10:58:45] <granden> how should i else do it?
[10:59:26] <ProLoser|Work> float them left and adjust the container, not each child
[10:59:42] <ProLoser|Work> think about it, you're doing calculations on multiple child elements which cause them to behave inconsistently
[10:59:50] <ProLoser|Work> instead of just doing 1 calculation on a container
[10:59:59] <ProLoser|Work> that's how most sliders are done
[11:00:04] <ProLoser|Work> this is assuming the order doesn't really change
[11:00:09] <ProLoser|Work> anyway
[11:00:35] <ProLoser|Work> looks like jquery can't animate a negative margin to 0 properly on safari? i'm not sure exactly
[11:01:24] <shoky> raj: :(
[11:01:28] <ProLoser|Work> in fact, different versions of jquery are giving different behaviors
[11:01:32] <ProLoser|Work> you're definitely diw
[11:05:26] <shoky> granden: its sliding for me on safari
[11:13:44] <whatthepoop> what's the most reliable way to detect when the document inside an iframe has loaded (similar to $(document).ready()...) from within that iframe, *not* the parent page it's in?
[11:14:36] <lathan> whatthepoop, if(document != top)
[11:14:43] <lathan> whatthepoop, not double checked answer...
[11:15:38] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: have the framed document call a function in the parent on load
[11:16:10] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: sorry, this iframe is an embeddable "widget embedded
[11:16:17] <whatthepoop> embedded in third-party's pages
[11:16:48] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: then you can't reliably know when its loaded, afaik
[11:16:49] <whatthepoop> I'm basically just trying to execute some javascript when the iframe's document has loaded fully, independent of the page it's on
[11:17:13] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: hmmm, interesting.. I'm seeing some hacky-looking methods, but I feel like I'm missing something.. thanks
[11:18:05] <whatthepoop> lathan: sorry, not following. how would I make use of that?
[11:19:05] <lathan> whatthepoop, oh, I thought you were asking if you were in a frame
[11:19:21] <lathan> whatthepoop, what you are asking is running into cross domain security
[11:19:29] <whatthepoop> lathan: ah, nope, but now what you said makes sense then :)
[11:19:50] <lathan> whatthepoop, these parent frames are on other domains? (even https vs http, or different subdomains)
[11:20:21] <whatthepoop> lathan: hmm, I assumed that wasn't the case with iframes.. I've always thought they're sort of run as if they're totally from the domain they're being served from, so there's no cross domain issues unless the parent page is trying to talk to the iframe or vice versa
[11:20:39] <lathan> nope, they are still frames @ whatthepoop
[11:21:15] <whatthepoop> lathan: the parent pages that the iframes reside on are on different domains, yes.. the iframe's src is pointing to a document on our server, but the iframe is being embedded elsewhere, similar to how youtube does with their video embed code
[11:22:04] <koden> I have been looking all over the internet for a way to limit the characters and line numbers of a textarea. all of them seem extremely long and complicated, I feel there is a quick and easy solution for this. Can anyone help out?
[11:22:05] <lathan> so: about.com has an iframe to server.com
[11:22:06] <whatthepoop> lathan: well, damn, all these years I had no clue...
[11:22:15] <lathan> whatthepoop, that just doesn't work
[11:22:21] <koden> I basically want to limit to 45 chars per line and only allow 2 lines
[11:22:28] <lathan> whatthepoop, unless you have cooperation of the domain that is hosting it
[11:22:43] <Mac_Weber> how to get a number after the hash in http://example.com/test#5 using window.onhashchange? .match does not work on the newURL
[11:23:03] <lathan> Mac_Weber, window.onhashchange is an event function
[11:23:07] <lathan> Mac_Weber, you want location.hash
[11:23:12] <lathan> ?mdc location.hash @ Mac_Weber
[11:23:32] <vl1234> hi how to get error java response  using jquery
[11:23:44] <Mac_Weber> lathan: I'm doing it on the hash change. I need the number on the new URL
[11:23:46] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: window.location.hash.match(/\d+/)
[11:23:50] <whatthepoop> lathan: thanks, looks like I have some reading to do
[11:24:03] <lathan> whatthepoop, look up cross domain security
[11:24:54] <lathan> ajpiano, are you someone who can get bot-t back online? seems its gone
[11:25:05] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: window.location.hash already returns only the part after the hash. But it does not work inside window.onhashchange, I must use the field newURL
[11:25:58] <whatthepoop> lathan: thanks, I'm vaguely familiar with the cross domain limitations, I just never ever realized that iframes are subject to them.. I always assumed that the 'src' of an iframe is sort of running in its own domain entirely from the parent page, almost exactly as if you were looking at the 'src' document in its own browser window
[11:26:25] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: oh ok, so then what is your question?
[11:26:33] <johnkpaul> you want to find the fragment of the newURL?
[11:26:42] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: www.joezimjs.com/javascript/the-lazy-mans-url-parsing/
[11:27:23] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: yes, I want to get "5" from the newURL  http://example.com/test#5
[11:27:41] <lathan> whatthepoop, no, because then I'd make my site have an iframe with 100% height and width, load it with your online banking page, and then log your username /password
[11:28:06] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: did you read that blog post?
[11:28:17] <johnkpaul> or, you could newUrl.split("#")[1]
[11:28:28] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: it is not opening here
[11:29:37] <interopc1p> in the chrome javascript console, how do I set a div display to block (when it's hidden)?
[11:30:02] <interopc1p> ("#div_id").display = block doesn't work
[11:30:08] <interopc1p> is this possible?
[11:30:11] <johnkpaul> interopc1p: using jquery?
[11:30:13] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: .split worked fine. Thanks a lot!
[11:30:27] <interopc1p> johnkpaul: sure
[11:30:29] <johnkpaul> $("#div_id").css("display","block")
[11:30:30] <lathan> $('#div_id').show() @ interopc1p
[11:30:42] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: no problem
[11:32:31] <felipe_Brz> hi my autocomplete widgets work ok if I cycle through the dynamic list with the keyboard, but I really needed to detect a click event on the dynamic list but I can't seem to be able to... has anyone ever come across this?
[11:32:31] <whatthepoop> lathan: hmm, just to make sure I'm being clear.. my goal is *not* for the parent page to tell when the iframe is loaded, but rather for the iframe itself to be self-aware of when it's finished loading, regardless of which page/domain it's embedded on. I'm not trying to have the iframe interact with the parent page, nor the parent page interact with the iframe.. does everything you just said still apply?
[11:32:48] <interopc1p> johnkpaul: thanks so much!
[11:32:53] <whatthepoop> lathan: and my apologies for being thick-headed here :)
[11:34:30] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: then a  $(function() {})  in the iframe would indicate that
[11:34:56] <NoiseEee> "the document is ready".  or a body.onload thing.
[11:35:20] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: ha, that's what I thought, but the standard $(document).ready().... isn't firing. is that because 'document' refering to the parent page's document, even though it's being used in the iframe?
[11:35:36] <lathan> whatthepoop, you are wanting the child frame to be able to touch the parent frame.
[11:35:43] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: it'll fire, in the iframe (assuming the iframe is also loading jquery)
[11:36:04] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: they are indeed self-contained documents/DOMs
[11:36:05] <lathan> NoiseEee, he wants the frame to bind an event to the parent's document.ready
[11:36:11] <koden> can anyone help out with limiting characters and lines in a textarea
[11:36:14] <lathan> NoiseEee, $(top).ready(...)
[11:36:27] <lathan> NoiseEee, except cross domain security should stop that from working
[11:36:39] <whatthepoop> lathan: ok, then I definitely have a total misunderstanding of the security model with iframes.. I thought they're two totally separate sandboxes documents.. hmm
[11:36:47] <rosieres> how do I make an alert, that tells me what kind of element $this is ?
[11:36:49] <johnkpaul> interopc1p: no problem
[11:36:50] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: try explaining again your goal.
[11:37:29] <lathan> whatthepoop, the can connect to each other, but cross domain security zaps you if you aren't the same domain
[11:37:58] <thelastbaldwin> has anyone ever encountered trouble with $.extend and accessing the extended object's prototype property?
[11:38:08] <thelastbaldwin> I'm able to add methods to my object, but no properties of the original object are accessible
[11:39:06] <ryanneufeld> thelastbaldwin: see ?jquery.extend()
[11:39:17] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: ha, ok. I'm simply trying to detect within the iframe itself when itself is loaded, regardless of what parent page/domain this iframe is embedded on. the iframe's document ('src') doesn't care about the state of the parent page it's embedded on, nor should the parent page care about the state of the iframe's document. I just want to execute some javascript in the iframe's 'src' document once the it itself has finished loading
[11:39:25] <ryanneufeld> ?extend @thelastbaldwin
[11:39:31] <ryanneufeld> dang no bot-t
[11:39:41] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/ @ thelastbaldwin
[11:39:47] <thelastbaldwin> would I use ?.extend instead of myObject.prototype?
[11:40:25] <thelastbaldwin> I've already created myObject by using $.extend, so I think that's where an issue is arising
[11:40:41] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: so pretend there is no iframe involved whatsoever, and have the iframe load jquery and call $(function(){})
[11:40:48] <ryanneufeld> thelastbaldwin: read all the words. like deep
[11:40:49] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: my apparently-wrong assumption is that $(document).ready().... within that iframe's src document would fire when the iframe document is fully-loaded like it would any other page, but it's not working that way
[11:40:49] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: im confused as to what the iframe has to do with anything
[11:40:58] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: of course it does
[11:41:21] <thelastbaldwin> ryanneufeld roger doger
[11:41:23] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul:  weird
[11:41:31] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: event.newURL.split("#")[1] does not work on IE
[11:41:34] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: I am, too! :) I've assumed it's essentially it's own 100%-detached HTML document with it's own DOM.. no js conflicts, etc
[11:41:58] <ryanneufeld> thelastbaldwin: it might help you. no promises though
[11:42:06] <whatthepoop> NoiseEee: ok, than I'm missing something else.. let me take another look at what I've written.. thanks for the patience....
[11:42:15] <NoiseEee> whatthepoop: what is your $(document).ready() function trying to do though, whatthepoop?   $(function() {alert('loaded!');}); in the iframe should most definetly fire
[11:42:31] <lathan> NoiseEee, whatthepoop: here is what he wants, but won't work: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/MEHtr/
[11:42:43] <lathan> and this page: http://jsbin.com/ahohev/5/edit
[11:43:20] <Mac_Weber> to tendo problema para pegar o novo hash, agora incompatibilidade com o IE usando event.newURL.split("#")[1]
[11:43:31] <lathan> NoiseEee, whatthepoop, the jsfiddle page has a frame pointing at jsbin, and in the error log you get: Permission denied to access property 'nodeType'
[11:43:35] <ryanneufeld> Mac_Weber: hablo englas?
[11:43:50] <lathan> ?bot
[11:43:57] <lathan> the bot-t is offline right now
[11:43:58] <Mac_Weber> ryanneufeld: wrong channel for the last message, sorry
[11:44:07] <ryanneufeld> Mac_Weber: np, just checking :p
[11:50:17] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: are you checking the parameter to your event handler or window.event?
[11:51:02] <johnkpaul> if you're not using jquery bbq to handle it, you'll need to gloss over the differences between modern browsers and IEs yourself
[11:54:24] <lathan> whatthepoop, here's my example with doc ready working:
[11:54:24] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/MEHtr/1/
[11:54:24] <lathan> http://jsbin.com/ahohev/8/edit
[11:54:44] <whatthepoop> bunnies!
[11:55:14] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: hummm I'm on Drupal 7, it says it uses jquery bbq... let me see how to use it...
[11:57:22] <whatthepoop> lathan, NoiseEee: ok, now it's working.... I've got no idea what was wrong, but after moving a few things around and commenting/uncommenting stuff, it's working exactly as I'd expected it would, and as NoiseEee says it should.. it was probably a stupid little typo somewhere, which wouldn't be the first time....
[11:57:38] <lathan> hate those
[11:57:38] <whatthepoop> lathan, NoiseEee: again, thanks so much for the patience...
[11:57:42] <lathan> np
[11:58:01] <lathan> johnkpaul, Mac_Weber, regular jquery (not sure about bbq) doesn't handle the oldURL and newURL event attributes
[11:58:05] <whatthepoop> lathan: even worse when you drag two people into the mess without realizing it was user error all along.. :/ again, thanks it's very much appreciate.
[11:58:09] <whatthepoop> *appreciated.
[11:58:14] <lathan> lol
[11:59:06] <Mac_Weber> lathan: it is handling. It is just nod doing .split() on the newURL
[11:59:20] <lathan> have a live demo?
[11:59:21] <Mac_Weber> lathan: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onhashchange
[12:00:12] <jimk> Hey
[12:00:46] <jimk> Hey buttholes, whats cracking :)
[12:01:01] <granden> shoky: Yeah it slides in safari
[12:01:06] <lathan> Mac_Weber, not a problem for me: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rwuhN/
[12:01:11] <granden> but there seams to be some problem with sliding reverse in safari
[12:01:13] <granden> tried that?
[12:01:22] <jimk> Shutup!!
[12:01:38] <jimk> (jimk) Shutup!!
[12:01:49] <jimk> (jimk) (jimk) Shutup!!
[12:02:23] <jimk> (jimk) (jimk) Shutup!!
[12:02:25] <Mac_Weber> lathan: it is working on Chrome, but not on IE
[12:02:32] <jimk> (jimk) (jimk) Shutup!!
[12:02:39] <jimk> (jimk) (jimk) Shutup!!
[12:03:48] <lathan> evil IE
[12:04:31] <lathan> Mac_Weber, perhaps that's because its not supported until IE 8?
[12:05:03] <Mac_Weber> lathan: I'm on IE9
[12:05:10] <lathan> hm
[12:05:23] <lathan> I draw the line on IE bugs........ LOL
[12:05:23] <Raydiation> is there a built in cookie support?
[12:05:38] <Raydiation> like read out the value of a cookie
[12:05:58] <Mac_Weber> lathan:  it is getting the newURL, but newURL.split is not working there, only on firefox and chrome
[12:05:58] <lathan> Mac_Weber, ok, uncomment out that first section, and look for the url value you want
[12:06:02] <lathan> really?
[12:06:07] <lathan> is newURL not a string?
[12:08:09] <lathan> Mac_Weber, try it with these extra debugging alerts: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rwuhN/1/
[12:09:23] <DannyZB> I have a jQuery plug-in which depends on 2 other ( pretty big ) plug-ins
[12:09:31] <DannyZB> whats the fastest way to load additional scripts ?
[12:09:47] <DannyZB> using $("<script />" , { src: "blah.js" } ) is incredibly slow
[12:12:12] <lathan> DannyZB, by "slow" do you mean time for browser to load it, or time for you to type it?
[12:12:23] <DannyZB> browser load time
[12:12:29] <DannyZB> http://www.online-vault.net/jdiskonline/example.html
[12:12:31] <DannyZB> see for yourself
[12:12:39] <DannyZB> it takes +- 10 sec to load for me
[12:12:44] <DannyZB> took 2 sec before
[12:12:52] <DannyZB> (with the same scripts )
[12:16:03] <lathan> 4.62 seconds
[12:16:29] <DannyZB> It's a plug-in
[12:16:34] <DannyZB> being this slow is unacceptable
[12:16:39] <lathan> okay..7...hm
[12:16:42] <Mac_Weber> lathan: undefined
[12:17:17] <DannyZB> it was pretty fast before , I think the browser just isn't caching the scripts when loading this way
[12:17:25] <DannyZB> how fast is $.getScript ?
[12:17:30] <lathan> DannyZB, you have 37 requests going out.....your lucky you only get that speed
[12:17:37] <ajpiano> DannyZB: so doing var s = document.createElement("script"); document.head.appendChild( s ); is appreciably faster somehow?
[12:17:42] <lathan> DannyZB, its an ajax call
[12:18:01] <DannyZB> lathan : I know
[12:18:12] <DannyZB> before I loaded the scripts dynamically it would load in 2 seconds
[12:18:35] <lathan> DannyZB, that is because statically, it has all the scripts immediately and can start immediately
[12:18:43] <ajpiano> DannyZB: loading the scripts dynamically is not what we call "a great idea"
[12:18:56] <lathan> DannyZB, by making a plugin load them, then it has to load the plugin, then start loading the other scripts
[12:18:56] <DannyZB> I'm distributing it as a plug-in
[12:19:12] <DannyZB> It's dependant on jqGrid
[12:19:22] <DannyZB> the other option is to let users load 3 scripts themselves .. which sucks ><
[12:19:25] <ajpiano> so ship it with jqgrid and tell them it has to be included somehow
[12:19:47] <lathan> try to join your scripts together, try to make the images with sprites
[12:20:01] <ajpiano> DannyZB: forcing them to have the 3 requests and dynamic load sucks even more
[12:20:04] <ajpiano> ^^
[12:20:10] <DannyZB> well that fucking sucks lol
[12:20:18] <ajpiano> you should solve the problem of the multiple scripts with a build process
[12:20:32] <DannyZB> ajpiano : build process ?
[12:20:36] <ajpiano> yes
[12:20:54] <DannyZB> embed the scripts in one gigantic scripts ?
[12:20:58] <DannyZB> script *
[12:21:03] <ajpiano> like, something that minifies and concats your JS and CSS for use in production
[12:21:17] <ajpiano> etc
[12:21:28] <DannyZB> ajpiano : I'm not sure I can do that , the other scripts are under different licenses
[12:21:41] <ajpiano> you don't have to do it
[12:21:57] <ajpiano> you just make it clear that it's a dependency
[12:22:10] <DannyZB> I think I'll go with that
[12:22:24] <DannyZB> and I'll minify the script once I make it beta
[12:23:19] <ajpiano> having a plugin that asynchronously loads its dependencies the first time someone tries to instantiate it
[12:23:21] <SmashingX> I need to know some part of code in jquery that when I select a checkbox it selects a radiobutton depending on what checkbox I select, can anybody help me on this?
[12:23:24] <ajpiano> is definitely something to avoid :p
[12:23:37] <lathan> DannyZB, also, about 1/3 of your time is in delays on the server end...having a good server / cluster would also help those who use your plugin
[12:23:51] <DannyZB> lathan : my script is super fast , I tested it inside-out
[12:23:52] <ajpiano> lathan: btw i have no dominion over bot-t
[12:23:59] <DannyZB> the dynamic loads were a hinderance
[12:24:07] <DannyZB> + I made a badass installed
[12:24:12] <lathan> ajpiano, oh well....it should be made harder to get it to disconnect...
[12:24:14] <DannyZB> INSTALLER *
[12:24:56] <ajpiano> DannyZB: you should check out grunt if you are interested in setting up some build steps for your plugin
[12:25:11] <ajpiano> lathan: bot-t is kind of like an independent operating ghost nowadays
[12:25:14] <lathan> DannyZB, by delays on the server end, I mean when the web page goes to download the images / scripts, there is transmission time for the request,  server delay while it processes, and then download time
[12:25:20] <jstat> Hey guys on http://goo.gl/uSr6B I'm using a jquery slider/video player for the black box on the right, but for some reason it plays the fist time you visit the site but when you go back to it, it just never loads, hard refresh works but I'm wondering if anyone has seen this before
[12:25:24] <lathan> ajpiano, shame...I really like using it
[12:25:28] <ajpiano> cause temp01 is the runner of bot-t but temp01 fell off the internet
[12:25:36] <DannyZB> lathan : I'll add it to the "wishlist" lol
[12:25:39] <lathan> lol
[12:25:41] <DannyZB> First I need it to be reliable
[12:26:08] <DannyZB> -bot-t
[12:26:14] <DannyZB> bot: kill all humans
[12:26:19] <lathan> the bot is offline
[12:26:21] <lathan> :(
[12:29:03] <vargero> hey guys ... i want to ask a very simple question: i display a list of power plants on my page, each plant is a div with id "plant-1" for example. inside each of this divs i have a span with id "power-1" that displays a values corresponding to the power being generated that moment (i'll make ajax calls to update this values every now and then). I want to know if is there an easy way to access
[12:29:03] <vargero> this spans and divs, giving that they will be created dynamically on server side (meaning that i can't have a predefined table.
[12:29:29] <brettfrable> http://www.quora.com/Brogramming/How-does-a-programmer-become-a-brogrammer
[12:29:35] <lathan> vargero, define what you mean by "access"
[12:30:00] <lathan> vargero, $('#plant-' + id) or $('#power-' + id)
[12:30:18] <vargero> one thing is that i want to put a mouseover event on this divs, but not using obstrusive javascript
[12:30:39] <lathan> try making a simple example with jsfiddle
[12:30:47] <lathan> jsfiddle.net @ vargero
[12:30:52] <DannyZB> Guys , I need opinions of a design : http://www.online-vault.net/jdiskonline/index.html
[12:31:13] <DannyZB> the lines at the bottom are placeholders for more content *
[12:31:37] <vargero> but this solution you gave, is it to create on server side a ginormous script or does jquery recognize the  $('#plant-' + id) sintax?
[12:31:52] <lathan> jquery does
[12:32:07] <lathan> vargero, but I don't know what you are trying to do, so I can't choose the best solution
[12:32:39] <jstat> Anyone ??
[12:35:18] <defaultro> hey folks, I would like to add a welcome window using modal window. I was given the html file where I need to add it. Where do I insert the code?
[12:35:45] <DannyZB> "add it " ? you want to load the window content from a file ?
[12:35:59] <defaultro> no, i can hardcode it
[12:36:11] <DannyZB> so whats the question ?
[12:36:18] <defaultro> oops, sorry was confusing
[12:36:36] <DannyZB> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[12:36:39] <defaultro> let's say you visited some sites. My boss wants me to add a modal window
[12:36:58] <defaultro> where there is a button so he can click it to close
[12:37:19] <defaultro> yup, something like that
[12:37:24] <defaultro> is that called a modal window?
[12:37:48] <defaultro> i was given the design of the box. It's a simple white box in the middle of the screen
[12:37:57] <defaultro> with few text on it and buttons
[12:38:25] <defaultro> do I add the code to <body onload="......"> ?
[12:39:12] <Zzaichik> awww yeah onload
[12:39:40] <defaultro> ok
[12:39:43] <Zzaichik> $(window).load(function () { // in here });
[12:40:04] <defaultro> should that be placed after <body>
[12:40:25] <defaultro> maybe i should see a source code so it's clearer. I'm new to jquery
[12:40:28] <Zzaichik> defaultro: don't listen to me, I need to go and read through your previous comments first.
[12:40:41] <defaultro> oh ok :)
[12:40:48] <Zzaichik> hang on a sec. ;)
[12:41:02] <ccohn_> Using Google Analytics to track click events on an href. In Safari, the request to the tracking gif is cancelled as soon as the page linked in the href starts to load, and the event is not tracked. Can I prevent default and then set the page location? Is there a better idea?
[12:41:38] <defaultro> thanks
[12:41:59] <jstat> Hey guys on http://goo.gl/uSr6B I'm using a jquery slider/video player for the black box on the right, but for some reason it plays the fist time you visit the site but when you go back to it, it just never loads, hard refresh works but I'm wondering if anyone has seen this before
[12:46:13] <Zzaichik> defaultro:  yeah I think that all you need to do is add the html to the page you want it to show up in, then when the page has been loaded / is ready, than show that element.
[12:46:16] <Zzaichik> right?
[12:46:27] <defaultro> yup
[12:46:32] <defaultro> that;s all i want to do
[12:46:49] <defaultro> if possible, the modal window shouldn't be resisable
[12:46:50] <defaultro> z
[12:47:13] <lathan> defaultro, read the documentation about it, and fine the setting to disable resize
[12:47:22] <defaultro> k
[12:47:26] <vargero> lathan: here is the link to jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/EsHrV/. It didn't work but at least it explains better what I want to do.
[12:48:27] <Zzaichik> ?.ready() @ defaultro
[12:48:40] <Zzaichik> maybe not
[12:49:25] <defaultro> k, I need to read the doc :)
[12:50:04] <lathan> Zzaichik, the bot is down :(
[12:50:32] <Zzaichik> awww
[12:51:00] <lathan> vargero, when using fiddle, always set it to have jquery included on the page (left sidebar)
[12:51:08] <nFFF> vargero, whats wrong with that code? :S
[12:51:34] <tocka> Hey
[12:51:38] <heyxi> hey
[12:51:54] <nFFF> hey
[12:52:06] <lathan> vargero, try this version: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/EsHrV/2/
[12:52:51] <lathan> ?hi
[12:52:51] <lathan> Bot-t: :)
[12:52:51] <tocka> Is it possible to get rss feeds using jquery
[12:52:53] <tocka> ?
[12:53:11] <lathan> tocka, aren't rss feeds just xml?
[12:53:13] <heyxi> how to load the html tag script using .load() function??
[12:53:25] <tocka> well yeah :/
[12:53:50] <lathan> tocka, $.get('url',function(){...}, 'xml')
[12:53:55] <lathan> tocka, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:54:09] <tocka> thank you
[12:54:09] <tocka> :)
[12:54:16] <vargero> lathan: thanks, exactly what i needed ... but my mind isn't jquery ready yet
[12:54:16] <johnkpaul> tocka: in case your rss feed is not in the same origin, I've used this https://github.com/dawanda/jquery-rss/blob/master/src/jquery.rss.js
[12:54:20] <lathan> heyxi, can you be more specific?: $('div').load('url-to-new-html')
[12:54:40] <lathan> johnkpaul, oops..nice catch
[12:54:40] <vargero> nFFF: the wrong part was my idea, basically
[12:55:03] <johnkpaul> lathan: your answer was correct too! I don't think tocka mentioned if it was on his own domain orn ot
[12:55:07] <lathan> vargero, well, you put in my code, but I was assuming you had an id and wanted to find the element
[12:55:13] <lathan> johnkpaul, don't think so...
[12:57:32] <heyxi> i just  use   $('div').load('target.html')  to load the target.html and it did, but the scripts in the target.html  is missing.
[12:58:22] <vargero> lathan: i thought that somehow it would understand that any element of the page that had an ID starting with "#plant-" would be taken in consideration when clicked
[12:58:49] <vargero> sorry if i can't express myself better in english ;/
[12:58:54] <lathan> vargero, its fine.
[12:59:16] <heyxi>  i can't express myself better in english  too.
[12:59:28] <lathan> vargero, you could do something like $('div[id^=plant-]') but make sure you only have it search inside of a container, because id^= is much slower than #
[12:59:48] <Krinkle> BRB
[13:00:12] <lathan> vargero,
[13:00:12] <lathan> $('[id^=plant') //bad
[13:00:12] <lathan> $('#container[id^=plant]') //less bad
[13:00:12] <lathan> $('#container div').click(.....) // much better
[13:01:24] <Azra-el> hi guys... how can i have 2 animations on 2 divs happening at the same time not sequentially? :P
[13:02:14] <raj> what's the correct way to setup the tabindex for textboxes within a jquery-ui dialog? if I put it in the html, won't it interfere with the tabindex of the rest of the page?
[13:02:15] <nFFF> Usually that question is the other way around :D
[13:03:02] <Azra-el> nFFF are u reffering to my question? ^^
[13:03:12] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: it should work just fine, just set the animation on each div, they should be async without you doing anything
[13:03:32] <nFFF> Azra-el yes :)
[13:05:05] <Azra-el> http://pastie.org/3885985
[13:05:24] <Azra-el> maybe im doing it wrong.. im just starting .. but now they are not async.. they happen sequentially
[13:06:09] <ccohn_> Having problems with Google Analytics asynchronous tracking beacon being interrupted on click(). Is there a suggested model for doing a preventDefault() and then triggering the events? Using trigger() or setting the browser's location?
[13:06:42] <lathan> AzaToth, not sure what you are wanting...is this anything like it: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/TQq3V/
[13:07:00] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: your adding one animation to every element
[13:07:11] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: and one animation to the clicked one
[13:07:51] <Azra-el> well.. yeah.. i need all divs of the class card to move down 50px but i only want the clicked div to animate the opacity to 0
[13:08:03] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: try $('.card').not(this).animate({ bottom: '-=50'}, 'slow');
[13:08:29] <Cork[home]> and followed by (this).animate({ bottom: '-=50', opacity: 'hide' }, 'slow');
[13:08:41] <Azra-el> aaah... so i should animate all BUT the clicked and JUST the clicked separatelly
[13:08:42] <Cork[home]> *$(this)
[13:08:51] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: yes
[13:09:03] <Cork[home]> Azra-el: else you put them into animation queue
[13:09:45] <Azra-el> dude.. that not(this) is absolutelly sugarrific :D
[13:09:55] <lathan> Azra-el, add this option to the animate: "queue": false
[13:10:22] <Azra-el> been a mootools user in the past just trying to learn jquery for a phonegap app and im hitting the ground running :)
[13:11:03] <lathan> Azra-el, change "slow" to { duration: "slow", "queue": false }
[13:11:33] <lathan> Azra-el, that tells jquery.fx to NOT use its queue (the "feature" to make effects go in order 1 at a time)
[13:12:25] <nFFF> lathan surely it makes more sense/more elegant to use .not()
[13:12:26] <nFFF> ?
[13:12:36] <lathan> nFFF, not, for what?
[13:12:42] <Azra-el> thank u lathan... i got what a que is :P but the thing is that cork's way is better since im'm going to need some animations happening at the same time and some qued (same divs)
[13:13:00] <ericandrewlewis> i'm attemping to replace cdn in all the srcs of iframes on page load. am i using this incorrectly here?
[13:13:00] <ericandrewlewis> jQuery("iframe").attr('src', this.attr('src').replace('cdn', '') );
[13:13:05] <lathan> Azra-el, well, that queue: false can be set on a per effect basis
[13:13:17] <nFFF> lathan, your way isn't recommended
[13:13:19] <ericandrewlewis> (obviously wrapping this in a document ready function)
[13:13:27] <nFFF> the queue was happening to a bad code design
[13:13:32] <nFFF> the answer isn't to hack around it
[13:13:38] <lathan> yah...
[13:13:39] <nFFF> the answer ist he re-design :>
[13:13:42] <lathan> true
[13:13:52] <nFFF> the reason the queue was happening is becuase the first animation was being applied
[13:13:58] <nFFF> when it wasn't meant to
[13:14:03] <lathan> nFFF, ah...didn't read Cork's suggestion
[13:14:29] <shoelessone> Hi all! Quick question! Can I pass in an entire function call, with parameters, as a parameter to another function?
[13:14:45] <lathan> sh0ne, function(){ newFunc(arg1, arg2, ...) )
[13:14:47] <lathan> *}
[13:14:51] <lathan> sorry sh0ne
[13:14:56] <lathan> shoelessone,     ^^^^^^^
[13:15:18] <shoelessone> One sec, I'm pasting some code together..
[13:15:32] <shoelessone> (but thank you very much lathan!)
[13:22:37] <shoelessone> So, here is what I'm talking about:
[13:22:39] <Whirl3d> $(".bgImages:visible").not(":first")?   or $(".bgImages:visible").gt(0) ? Or $(".bgImages").filter(":visible").not(".bgImages:visible:first")?  if I am trying to get all but one of the visibile bgImages...
[13:22:43] <shoelessone> https://gist.github.com/54f5afcf1957bbba8b37
[13:23:47] <nFFF> ?tias @ Whirl3d
[13:24:13] <lathan> shoelessone, you want call or apply
[13:24:15] <lathan> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[13:24:17] <lathan> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[13:24:32] <lathan> shoelessone, exactly what you want, ^^^
[13:25:17] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I got enough time to try every possible combination to see which is fastest or most effecient, great idea. Or maybe, I could rely on the expertise of someone who was more familiarwith selectors and their relative speed/cost/readability values....hmmm
[13:25:18] <shoelessone> apply? or call? I've seen call, but the strange thing (and I htink I'm being an idiot here) is that I'm including the parameters in the function call.. So I'm not sure if the function is evaluated before it's sent to the function, or
[13:25:21] <lathan> Whirl3d, $('.bgimages:visible') and $('.bgimages').filter(':visible') are virtually the same, although the 2nd string parse in filter could take a little more
[13:25:26] <shoelessone> I guess I could just add the parameter is a third parameter
[13:25:37] <lathan> shoelessone, apply is if you have the arguments in a list and don't know how many arguments there are
[13:25:46] <lathan> shoelessone, call is if you have 3 variables and want to use them
[13:26:01] <Whirl3d> So the pseudo selectors are generall faster?
[13:26:07] <lathan> Whirl3d, they should all work
[13:26:19] <Whirl3d> sure. Which is best, though.
[13:26:24] <Whirl3d> or is there a better way?
[13:26:29] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, btw
[13:26:33] <lathan> Whirl3d, technically the .gt(0) is faster because it doesn't have to do string parsing on :first....
[13:26:36] <lathan> :not(:first)
[13:26:39] <shoelessone> Thanks lathan, much appreciated! <3
[13:26:47] <lathan> unless you have a huge page it probably doesn't matter Whirl3d
[13:26:51] <lathan> np @ shoelessone
[13:27:34] <lathan> Whirl3d, but probably fastest would be: $('.bgImages:visible').gt(0)
[13:27:41] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reminder...too easy to get sidetracked with making code that Eviltwin will approve of. LOL
[13:27:43] <lathan> Whirl3d, but you have to start nitpicking to notice the difference
[13:28:04] <lathan> lol
[13:28:25] <Whirl3d> He is the master at taking two or three pages of my code and rewriting it in 1 function. I swear
[13:28:32] <nFFF> slice() is fastest
[13:29:00] <lathan> nFFF but it requires it to be outside of the jQuery object...so depending on what Whirl3d wants to do with it afterwards....
[13:29:13] <hacks> How do I select elements that have sibling next to them?
[13:29:17] <lathan> Whirl3d, chaining sure is fun....
[13:29:21] <PIlotBob> probably more of a styling issue, but does anyone have an idea of why floats inside an accordion div in IE8 would look like a stairstep. They render properly in Chrome and FF. (yes I know, IE sucks)
[13:29:24] <hacks> a specific sibling?
[13:29:33] <lathan> hacks, google: jquery sibling selector
[13:29:49] <hacks> I don't want to "get" the sibling though
[13:29:53] <larzen-wrk2> question... I am using jQuery UI and I instantiate ONE object from within another, and set the parent as a options{ parent: }. Now, can I execute functions within that parent object, or do I have to do callbacks?
[13:29:53] <lathan> PIlotBob, check your whitespace / linespacing
[13:29:57] <hacks> I want to get the element that has a sibling
[13:30:27] <PIlotBob> lathan: of what element?
[13:30:43] <nFFF> $('*').siblings('.foo').end();
[13:31:14] <larzen-wrk2> jQueryUI widget model : jq1 creates jq2, and i want jq2 to call a function within jq1. Is this possible?
[13:31:15] <nFFF> wait that wouldn't work
[13:31:23] <lathan> whitespace between the accordian elements, check the lineheight.....idk..evil IE @ PIlotBob
[13:32:10] <PIlotBob> lathan: hmm... you mean whitespace in the markup? The accordions look fine, it is the controls inside it?
[13:32:23] <lathan> nFFF wild guess: $('*').filter(function(){ return $(this).siblings().length})
[13:32:33] <ccohn_> Is there a "right" way to stop a click event on an href and then repropagate it?
[13:32:36] <lathan> PIlotBob, do you have a demo? jsfiddle?
[13:32:53] <lathan> ccohn_, event.preventDefault()
[13:33:17] <hacks> #hasSibling ~ #elementIWantToSelect will give me the element I want, ONLY if the sibling proceeds the selector. I'm looking for the opposite, I want to get the element if IT proceeds the sibling.
[13:33:23] <lathan> ccohn_, the repropagating it is harder
[13:33:44] <nFFF> lathan thats seems like a nice way
[13:34:00] <lathan> hacks, $('*').filter(function(){ return $(this).siblings().length})
[13:34:03] <ccohn_> lathan: I see trigger(), but I don't quite understand it.
[13:34:06] <vargero> i'm getting that annoying uncaught syntax error: unexpected token message. anyone care to take a look? https://aqx.floripa.com.br/page.htm It is basically the code lathan wrote inside my page
[13:34:32] <hacks> lathan: I don't think that does what I'm trying to do.
[13:34:36] <PIlotBob> lathan: I can try to see if I can do a demo.
[13:35:39] <larzen-wrk2> anyone? anyone with jqueryui widget experience here?
[13:35:39] <nFFF> hacks, well your question really isn't phrased right: 'element that has a sibling' should be 'elements that are siblings'
[13:36:44] <lathan> hacks, jQuery.extend(jQuery.extr[':'],{ 'hasSibgling': function() { return $(this).siblings().length > 0; } } );
[13:36:44] <larzen-wrk2> I have one "widget" that creates a child widget, and I want the child widget to execute a function in the parent widget. Is this possible?
[13:36:44] <lathan> hacks, then :hasSibgling
[13:36:45] <lathan> larzen-wrk2, a lot of things are possible...you are being a bit to vague for us to help
[13:36:45] <hacks> nFFF: "Element that is a sibling before another element"
[13:37:27] <larzen-wrk2> lathan. let me paste...
[13:37:34] <nFFF> hacks, what does that mean though, there could be 4 siblings, you want the first 3?
[13:37:35] <lathan> hacks, like $('div ~ span ~ img') ?
[13:37:44] <lathan> a span with a div before it and an img after it?
[13:38:07] <lathan> hacks, you want an element that is a sibling of another?
[13:38:09] <cesarstafe> people, a simple question but I don't know the answer
[13:38:17] <lathan> ?ask
[13:38:26] <cesarstafe> is possible to get a value of h4 tag?
[13:38:31] <lathan> no
[13:38:33] <lathan> .html
[13:38:40] <lathan> $('h4:first').html()
[13:38:59] <cesarstafe> $('h4#954840304954').html();
[13:39:04] <cesarstafe> can work ?
[13:39:04] <lathan> cesarstafe, the label in an h4 is inside the <h4> and </h4> so its called the innerHTML
[13:39:04] <lathan> yes
[13:39:11] <lathan> watch numerical ids though....
[13:39:15] <lathan> can break
[13:39:47] <PIlotBob> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/PtLGT/ interesting, it does it there in chrome before I even wrap it with the accordion.
[13:40:00] <cesarstafe> lathan: great
[13:40:04] <lathan> IDs are not allowed to begin with a number @ cesarstafe
[13:40:10] <cesarstafe> I'll try
[13:41:53] <lathan> PIlotBob, add jquery please....
[13:41:55] <lathan> never put something in jsfiddle without setting up the javascript libraries....
[13:42:25] <cesarstafe> lathan: it works! many thanks for your quick answer! ;-)
[13:43:02] <lathan> cesarstafe, really, watch out for your IDS...they are against the specifications. IE may break
[13:43:27] <lathan> cesarstafe, try something like h954849394954 instead
[13:43:32] <PhonicUK> hey everyone

[13:46:56] <multiHYP> I am very frustrated with fadeIn in jquery. everyone says I should put it in the window.load, but it won't work there. if I put it in document.ready it works but is inconsistent. also, display: none; for the (images in this case) to be faded in fails, if I do display: hidden; then nothing fades in really, just appears.

[14:06:56] <jonkersjoe> shoky: how would I be able to resolve it ?
[14:07:08] <shoky> larzen-wrk2: i changed it to a direct method call instead of the widget-style method call
[14:07:23] <larzen-wrk2> oh interesting. I wonder why that works?
[14:07:31] <shoky> jonkersjoe: by not have circular structure in your objects
[14:07:35] <shoky> having*
[14:07:52] <shoky> larzen-wrk2: because its a direct method call, there's no reason why it shouldn't work
[14:10:44] <David_Bradbury> I'm trying to change the preserveAspectRatio attribute of an SVG element using jQuery. Instead of changing it, it seems to just add its own lowercase version of it (preserveaspectratio)
[14:10:59] <David_Bradbury> Any ideas why it won't modify the original attribute?
[14:11:40] <shoky> SVG DOM is different than HTML DOM
[14:12:17] <shoky> sometimes you need to change attributes on different elemnts to get the effect you want
[14:12:24] <David_Bradbury> But isn't the SVG element part of the HTML DOM?
[14:12:31] <shoky> thats most of what i know to tell you ;p
[14:12:49] <shoky> it is, but uhh its different, i dont really know the details ;)
[14:14:07] <shoky> if you search the channel logs for maybe 6-7 hours ago some dude was having a similar issue changing "x" attribute on an svg element
[14:14:26] <shoky> he found some solution at the end which was to change it for some other element instead... donno ;)
[14:15:29] <johnkpaul> David_Bradbury: you can't use setAttribute with svg elements
[14:15:32] <johnkpaul> as .attr does under the hood
[14:15:38] <johnkpaul> you need to use setAttributeNS
[14:15:48] <shoky> jkp thats not always true
[14:15:54] <David_Bradbury> Well, it isn't an SVG element, it is the actual SVG tag itself. Javascript's setAttribute seems to work
[14:15:57] <shoky> and it wasn't true in the case earlier today
[14:16:01] <shoky> we just thought it was, for a while
[14:16:10] <johnkpaul> oh really? I thought the solution with NS(null)
[14:16:18] <shoky> NS(null) is the same as no NS
[14:16:22] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[14:16:35] <johnkpaul> well then don't listen to me, ask the #svg channel on irc.mozilla.net
[14:16:38] <shoky> the solution was to change it on some <tspan> element instead of the <text> he originally tried
[14:16:44] <shoky> but i donno how that works
[14:16:53] <johnkpaul> oh, tspan is an svg tag?
[14:16:55] <shoky> nor how he found it out ;P
[14:17:09] <shoky> no idea
[14:17:23] <shoky> i just remember looking at his last fiddle and seeing something like that
[14:19:16] <David_Bradbury> Raphaeljs makes me a sad panda. I'm going to have to reprogram some of it to get it to do what I want =/
[14:22:52] <granden> Hello
[14:22:57] <nFFF> David_Bradbury
[14:23:04] <granden> Got some problem with my jquery
[14:23:14] <nFFF> nothing in svg jquery that can help?
[14:23:19] <granden> margin-left dont seam to be able to be -100% in safari, works in every other browser.
[14:23:41] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/granden/h2ETE/1/ - have a jsfiddle there
[14:23:49] <granden> of what I have done
[14:24:12] <David_Bradbury> nFFF: Well, I fixed my issue. My issue now is that Raphael.js has simplified things too much. I may use SVG jQuery, but we'll see
[14:26:23] <granden> Anyone?
[14:27:30] <easytiger> if i have web page and i have many elements to update every 10 seconds.. what's the best approach to communicate with my backend?
[14:27:47] <easytiger> i.e i'll be pulling lots of json
[14:33:09] <shoky> $.getJSON , setTimeout  ?
[14:33:48] <easytiger> shoky: @me?
[14:33:56] <shoky> yes
[14:33:56] <Bankzilla> |\/\/|
[14:34:42] <shoky> a crown, for me?
[14:34:59] <Bankzilla> was trying to make a new line instead it sent
[14:35:04] <Bankzilla> :(
[14:35:08] <shoky> :(((
[14:36:48] <granden> shoky: You remember my safari-problem with sliding images? My internet connection got interrupted for some reason but back now, did you have any solution to it or any idea on how to solve it?
[14:37:58] <shoky> when i tried it on safari it seemed fine
[14:38:29] <shoky> maybe i didnt know what problem to be looking for
[14:39:04] <jonkersjoe> hi, how would i access the parents property/members from a child object ?
[14:39:22] <shoky> DOM parent?
[14:39:27] <jonkersjoe> I'm not using protypal inhereitence ?
[14:39:31] <jonkersjoe> no not the dom
[14:40:00] <shoky> then what do you mean by parent
[14:40:29] <granden> shoky: Ok, http://jsfiddle.net/granden/h2ETE/ created a new fiddle. If you try that one in another browser then safari, lets say firefox, and you press the blue image at top, and then the red.
[14:40:33] <granden> You see how it should work
[14:40:46] <granden> and doing the same procedure in safari animates the transitions differents
[14:41:28] <granden> in safari the image is always comeing in from the right
[14:41:33] <granden> even if it should be coming in from the left
[14:41:37] <granden> shoky: *
[14:41:57] <jonkersjoe> shoky: in my example http://jsfiddle.net/MW4HF/1/ I was trying to stringify the object but it had a circular reference because I had "this" of the parent being passed to the child. I did this so that I can keep a link between parent and the child. However, since stringify is causing a circular reference exception, I'm resovle it by removing the "this" and looking for another way to access the parent from the child
[14:42:54] <shoky> granden: you mean the background?
[14:43:38] <granden> shoky: the image inside the #slide div
[14:43:42] <granden> not the #slidebg
[14:43:48] <granden> the hockeyplayer img
[14:43:48] <Bankzilla> no bot today
[14:44:33] * PhonicUK pokes shoky
[14:45:07] <granden> shoky: Do you get what I try to explain?
[14:45:08] <blez> is there a way to tell if the content is outside the visible window?
[14:46:40] <phoenixsampras> help!!, i can figure out how to use JSONP with jquery, is there any step by step tutorial plz
[14:47:12] <shoky> jonkersjoe: donno how to solve your issue
[14:47:13] <David_Bradbury> I think Google is broken today
[14:47:21] <StormTrooper> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+jsonp
[14:47:26] <shoky> jonkersjoe: you can't just reference the "parent"
[14:47:29] <Bankzilla> must have something to do with bot-t missing
[14:47:29] <shoky> without a .. reference
[14:47:41] <shoky> PhonicUK: yes?
[14:47:48] <PhonicUK> shoky, new video!
[14:48:02] <PhonicUK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lGwqi8L_g
[14:48:05] <shoky> yes.
[14:48:10] <granden> shoky: Anything?
[14:48:14] <shoky> granden, sec
[14:48:15] <PhonicUK> no more floating toolboxes :)
[14:48:20] <granden> ok, sorry.
[14:48:35] <shoky> PhonicUK: this excites my nutsack
[14:48:49] <PhonicUK> what do yuo think of the UI changes?
[14:49:00] <shoky> sec, checking grandens stuff
[14:50:11] <shoky> granden: sorry i dont see a difference. maybe im using a different safari version or smth
[14:50:19] <granden> hmm
[14:50:25] <granden> which version of safari do you use?
[14:50:32] <shoky> well, i dont
[14:50:35] * blez waves
[14:50:37] <blez> is there a way to tell if the content is outside the visible window?
[14:50:42] <shoky> but
[14:50:57] <shoky> 5.0.5 ;S
[14:51:02] <shoky> i have no idea if that is old or new
[14:51:10] <shoky> im guessing old
[14:52:49] <granden> not that old, I got 5.1.5
[14:53:07] <granden> shoky: So you mean, if you click the yellow hockeyplayer at the top
[14:53:15] <granden> and after that presses the blue one
[14:53:23] <granden> the blue one slides in from the left
[14:53:24] <granden> ?
[14:53:33] <granden> NOT from the right side of the div.
[14:53:51] <shoky> yep
[14:54:04] <shoky> im running it on OSX snow leopard 10.6.8
[14:54:16] <shoky> @ virtualbox .. . . . . . . .
[14:55:10] <granden> damn it
[14:55:20] <granden> running it in lion, with safari 5.1.5
[14:55:25] <granden> it does not work correctly
[14:55:37] <shoky> sori ;\
[14:55:42] <mistenkt> anyone who could help me out for a few minutes with etch.js ?
[14:56:10] <granden> is there any other way to slide an image left to right and right to left in a div?
[14:56:15] <shoky> PhonicUK: i've seen docking panels before.. they are nice. u r l33t.
[14:56:17] <granden> other then animate and margin-left?
[14:56:45] <shoky> animate left ?
[14:58:23] <granden> shoky: ?
[14:58:32] <shoky> animate 'left' property
[14:58:35] <shoky> no?
[14:59:44] <granden> but I would still need a negative value
[14:59:45] <granden> ?
[15:00:02] <shoky> depends on the direction
[15:00:12] <shoky> i guess it'd be opposite sign from the margin-left
[15:00:22] <granden> hmm
[15:00:37] <granden> dont really follow, do you mind try it in my fiddle?
[15:01:43] <]Darker[> hi guys

[15:11:57] <ansimation> I've got a weird issue with this page here http://173.168.172.225/fandistro/dev/projects/new/step2/ - when you toggle 'make all full length' it works as it should but for some reason the checkbox isn't getting a check. the markup shows a checked="checked" being added and removed but it's not actually visible for some reason? here's the code the handles the toggleing http://pastebin.com/1GzCGD81

[15:24:13] <antipattern> i want to set up a jqueryui datepicker using $(document).on ... it seems to be working using more or less what i found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2386718/jquery-live-failing-with-jquery-ui-datepicker
[15:24:38] <mparodi> Hello
[15:24:39] <antipattern> but i dont understand what i'm using (why are they calling removeClass? or destroy?) and i'm wondering if there's a beter way
[15:24:54] <mparodi> is there any way to get the height of a textarea?
[15:25:32] <mparodi> I'm not talking about .height(), it doesn't consider the scroll bars
[15:28:13] <granden> Ok, now I got a little jquery ui problem
[15:28:19] <granden> its the range slider.
[15:29:00] <granden> http://agfoto.se//acte/undersida.html
[15:29:04] <granden> thats the url for it
[15:29:12] <granden> so far just the demo
[15:29:32] <granden> but price range, I would like it to be shown at the begining and end of the slider.
[15:30:08] <StormTrooper> I have my own question, but it's a bit noobish.
[15:30:40] <StormTrooper> http://paste.debian.net/168105/ doesn't work... the URL in question exists. Am I simply making a simple JS noob mistake here?
[15:32:15] <StormTrooper> nvm
[15:32:26] <Bankzilla> shoky: whats your actual job occupation?
[15:32:30] <StormTrooper> I might be handcrafting my JSON wrong.
[15:33:09] <Bankzilla> StormTrooper:  www.jsontlint.com
[15:35:54] <raj> what's the correct way to setup the tabindex for textboxes within a jquery-ui dialog? if I put it in the html, won't it interfere with the tabindex of the rest of the page?
[15:39:46] <StormTrooper> Bankzilla, turns out my JSON was wrong, as I predicted
[15:40:00] <shoky> Bankzilla: i'm a coder..
[15:40:46] <granden> jqueryui was pretty difficult
[15:43:05] <granden> Did a simple image in photoshop on how I would like the range slider
[15:43:06] <granden> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2214049/ui.jpg
[15:43:10] <granden> if anyone would like to help
[15:43:38] <ryanneufeld> granden: you should be able to do that with jqueryui
[15:43:57] <granden> yeah I know, I got the sample right now
[15:44:04] <granden> http://agfoto.se/acte/undersida.html
[15:44:21] <granden> but dunno how to put the min/maximum at the begining/end.
[15:45:15] <imsky> hnngr
[15:45:49] <ryanneufeld> granden: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range that might be of some help
[15:52:19] <granden> ryanneufeld: yeah, but dont really get it, mind helping out a little bit?
[16:00:02] <granden> can you have a selector with multiple id's?
[16:00:03] <granden> like
[16:00:12] <granden> $("#id1 #id2")
[16:00:13] <granden> ?
[16:02:32] <danzik17> when you receive an ajax error, how can you tell if the error is a result of the user navigating away from the page while the request is still pending? so far i've got request.readyState === 0 && request.statusText === "error" .... wondering if there's a better way
[16:04:19] <Less_Seen> granden separate them with commas
[16:06:49] <granden> Less_Seen: Hmm
[16:06:55] <granden> ok
[16:07:01] <granden> thanks, but for some reason it wont work
[16:07:02] <granden> http://agfoto.se/acte/undersida.html
[16:07:03] <Less_Seen> $("#id1,#id2")
[16:07:07] <granden> got it like that now
[16:07:45] <granden> do you see what I try to achive?
[16:11:06] <granden> Less_Seen: ?
[16:11:44] <Less_Seen> sorry, i am pretty busy atm..
[16:11:45] <s-cream> hi, what is jquery???
[16:11:50] <granden> Less_Seen: Oh, ok.
[16:12:19] <granden> I will go to sleep and give it a new try tomorrow. 01:12 here, going to work 08 :)
[16:12:34] <granden> did not notice the clock until now.
[16:12:40] <granden> Good night everyone
[16:12:49] <Less_Seen> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[16:12:49] <s-cream> anyone?
[16:14:09] <Bankzilla> s-cream: Jquery is a javascript library to help write longer javascript features shorter
[16:15:14] <s-cream> Bankzilla: thx, just testing if you guys are still awake... ;-)
[16:15:59] <Bankzilla> There's always people here, they're most likely just coding and only flick back every now and then
[16:16:25] <s-cream> like me... and probably you...
[16:16:32] <imsky> and me
[16:16:41] <s-cream> imsky: ++
[16:16:48] <imsky> i lubs you internet stranger
[16:16:49] <Getty> this channel lost its culture
[16:16:50] <imsky> s-cream++
[16:16:54] <imsky> Getty, you lie
[16:16:58] <imsky> i am this channel's culture
[16:17:00] <Getty> there is no channel anymore, just a support chat
[16:17:09] <imsky> lol that's because of nazi ops
[16:17:18] <Getty> lol
[16:17:29] <imsky> it's the way it goes for everything on freenode
[16:17:36] <Getty> its more like cause of the culture that was populated after the first grow of the channel
[16:17:43] <imsky> first it's cool and exciting, then it's full of IT nerds trying to center a box on a screen
[16:17:59] <Getty> hey, on #duckduckgo we keep the channel with high offtopic frequency, that keeps the channel and the culture alive
[16:18:07] <imsky> trudats
[16:18:08] <Getty> LOL!
[16:18:41] <Bankzilla> duckduckgo lol
[16:18:49] <Getty> :)
[16:18:49] <Bankzilla> hated that game, i never got picked
[16:19:06] <Bankzilla> they always picked the fat kids cause they never got caught
[16:19:06] <zkirill> Why does jQuery.hasData() work but $.hasData() doesn't?
[16:19:28] <danzik17> zkirill: did you call $.noConflict at some point
[16:19:39] <zkirill> danzik17: not that I'm aware of
[16:19:42] <Getty> Bankzilla: hehe i actually talk more about duckduckgo.com, but if this topic is so emotional for you, i better shouldnt ;)
[16:19:59] <imsky> ddg is dece, but it's somewhat slow
[16:20:01] <Bankzilla> lol
[16:20:07] <danzik17> zkirill:  does the following return true in your console:           $ === jQuery
[16:20:08] <s-cream> or open like jQuery(function($) { .. });
[16:20:08] <Bankzilla> duckduckgo.com sfw?
[16:20:13] <imsky> yes
[16:20:15] <Getty> imsky: we are working on it
[16:20:26] <imsky> good luck amigo and godspeed
[16:20:27] <zkirill> danzik17: spelling mistake, i'm an idiot, thanks anyway
[16:20:34] <imsky> my favorite ddg search: !g *
[16:20:35] <snover> safe for work until you search for porn
[16:20:43] <snover> then not safe unless you work in porn
[16:20:52] <imsky> so it's safe on balance
[16:20:56] <snover> yes, definitely
[16:25:29] <Getty> bankzilla: i mean, if you have 3 billion tickets you have 3 million users, so why not let them help you?
[16:25:39] <Getty> its just an organisational thing, and a question of "do we wanna care?"
[16:26:54] <ei2matrix> Hi guys, question, I'm trying to post dinamic data with uploadify, I read the doc but I can't found a way to post it, nothing work. I know that maybe this isn't a channel but well, if somebody know something about will help me a lot!
[16:26:59] <antipattern> Bankzilla: no tracking, that's their main value proposition afaik.  when the fbi serves them with a court order for all your search history, they won't have anything to give them.  i don't think they make any claim to have better search results
[16:27:14] <antipattern> at least, not yet
[16:34:48] <Getty> antipattern: yes, as we are using other peoples index we are not going to say that ever :)

[17:14:22] <KwikkSilva> hey all
[17:14:25] <KwikkSilva> people around
[17:17:24] <shoky> ttt
[17:20:59] <Bankzilla> console.debug(logInfo);
[17:44:52] <Azra-el> how can i increment the current z=index value of a div? $(this).css("z-index", '+=1') doesnt seem to be it :)
[17:45:48] <Eviltwin> $(this).css("z-index", parseInt($(this).css("z-index")) + 1)
[17:47:13] <Azra-el> how about it it was on a whole class? $(".card").not(this).css('z-index','+=1') ;
[17:52:38] <phoenixsampras> oh i suffer… jsonp
[17:56:19] <systemfault> Eww, jsonp
[17:57:10] <Azra-el> still cant manage it damn it.... if i have  $(".card").not(this).css('z-index','+=1') ; it doesnt really work as i ant it.. need to increment the zindex based on the current zindex of each particular div of that class
[17:58:45] <shoky> $(...).each( function() { var el=$(this); el.css('z-index', parseInt(el.css('z-index')) + 1); } )
[17:58:47] <systemfault> Azra-el: Eviltwin gave you the answer...
[17:59:47] <Azra-el> i must have missunderstood something
[18:01:21] <Azra-el> yes.. i did and it works perfect.. missunderstdood
[18:07:52] <Azra-el> nope.. doesnt work :( http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/
[18:11:29] <jjjrmy> Can someone help me with my Jquery? I had these nice buttons that toggled the view of something and now they just don't seem to work anymore. :(
[18:12:08] <Jon47> ?ask
[18:12:30] <jjjrmy> Oh yeah, and here is the site: http://fylez.me/
[18:12:33] <jjjrmy> ?ask
[18:14:34] <Jon47> jjjrmy: where is the code that binds those buttons to the view of something?
[18:15:04] <jjjrmy> Jon47: Line 122 is starts on.
[18:15:17] <Jon47> of what file?
[18:15:23] <Azra-el> anybody can give me any hints on http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/ ? the zindex increment isnt working as it should
[18:15:28] <jjjrmy> Jon47: Index
[18:15:43] <Jon47> oh i see
[18:16:20] <jjjrmy> Jon47: It worked earlier today too, dunno why it stopped.
[18:18:57] <Jon47> jjjrmy: something with your responsiveness, the class name of the buttons on the ".visible-phone" version of hte page (which is display:none!important) differs from the class name on the actually visible buttons, and the visible buttons don't seem to have any events bound to them
[18:19:40] <jjjrmy> Jon47: Resize the page to the size of a phone and the button will show up.
[18:19:46] <Jon47> great
[18:19:55] <Jon47> you still don't have events bound to the buttons at a regular browser size
[18:20:19] <jjjrmy> Jon47: becaues they don't show up at a regular size.
[18:21:06] <Jon47> i see three buttons, which do nothing, and that's the problem right?  the answer is there is no javascript binding any handlers to their click event, so of course they do nothing
[18:21:40] <Jon47> gotta run, good luck with it
[18:21:50] <jjjrmy> thanks man!

[18:29:11] <preinheimer> I've got "var form = $( this ).children('form');" developed after submitting a form via a dialog box. I'd like to obtain the value of the various form inputs and input areas. What's the right way to go about that? I've got a lot of dialog boxes on that page so I don't necesarily have the ID for each input element.

[18:47:26] <arnpro> hey guys, does anybody know how this site http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/scoreboard make it possible to auto update the games dashboard without ajax requests? they dont show in the firebug/chrome console... and it is not flash
[18:49:01] <preinheimer> You're sure it's not flash? http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/mlb/gamecenter/league_wide_alert.swf
[18:49:52] <Azra-el> http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/ any tips regarding why the zindex increment is not working as it should?
[18:50:35] <arnpro> preinheimer: oh didn't notice, but that's just that tiny frame there, what about the table wrapping it??
[19:05:33] <rosieres_respawn> does anybody know a chrome extension that simulates slower internet connections ?
[19:15:22] <marke> rosieres_respawn you could just cap the connection speed on the network interface
[19:19:30] <rosieres_respawn> marke INDEED !! -> trickle does it ;-) THX

[19:27:59] <Phizes> just so you know, I just wanted to leave you with an altered sense of reality and not actually kill you :(
[19:33:16] <Phizes> coldhead: Have coffee and realise that hundreds of people if not more have benefitted from your existence and edgey support answers

[19:43:46] <tga> hello
[19:45:02] <tga> quick check, do I understand correctly that getJSON on '/foo?mycallback=?' will do jsonp?

[20:02:03] <defaultro> hey folks, my officemate added a draggable dialog window to our  main page(dev environment). I was tasked to add a jquery dialog window too. However, this dialog is a welcome box(with continue button) and I would like to hide his dialogue window. Is that possible?
[20:03:36] <Talon_> his window is prolly some kinda containing element like a div, just find it and set its style display to none
[20:04:04] <defaultro> k
[20:04:26] <defaultro> then once I click my Continue button on my dialog, how do I tell it to become visible?
[20:04:37] <defaultro> document.getElementby?
[20:04:45] <Talon_> same thing, only instead of none, it would most likely be block
[20:04:56] <defaultro> k
[20:05:27] <defaultro> i'm very confused on his code since everything was written in Kohana :(
[20:06:40] <defaultro> maybe, it's the <div class=welcome>
[20:06:49] <Talon_> defaultro: got a link?
[20:06:57] <defaultro> it's developement env
[20:08:04] <walles> hello anyone can help ?
[20:08:29] <defaultro> Talon, did you see my message?
[20:09:46] <jstout24> what's a command to change uri encoding from + to %20
[20:10:54] <Talon_> jstout24: i think its encodeuricomponent or something like that
[20:11:27] <Talon_> and + would be %2B anyways.

[20:12:28] <danzik171> when you receive an ajax error, how can you tell if the error is a result of the user navigating away from the page while the request is still pending? so far i've got request.readyState === 0 && request.statusText === "error" .... wondering if there's a better way
[20:31:50] <Bankzilla> danzik171: if a user redirects from the page they'll never see the error
[20:35:06] <danzik171> Bankzilla: normally yep, but in this case there's a window.alert being shown.  this is a shared component, so i can't modify it and break other teams' assumptions about the blocking nature of the handler IF an error occurs, but modifying the error handler to ignore that specific scenario is reasonable enough
[20:39:22] <davisee> i want to use jquery in a module. is there any reason not to just add on to the $ namespace instead of using jquery "under the hood"?
[20:47:19] <sacho> what if some other module does the same thing
[20:56:14] <joobie> hi guys.. how can i get this to work? http://pastebin.com/PsPWkZHR .. item is basically given in this sorta format .. onclick="removeDanceItem(this);" from an input button
[20:58:48] <zyltoid> anyone know how i can get a tooltip for an entire 'block' of data instead of just the 2 points, using flot?
[21:00:59] <xp_prg2> hi all I am trying to dynamically create unordered lists within unorderedlists I know how to add a ul and li with .append but what if i want to append to what I just added, how do I get its handle to append to it?
[21:02:01] <rakl> Is the cancan gem still reliable? hasn't been updated for quite a qhile
[21:14:13] <xp_prg2> I want to dynamically create an unordered list and insert more unordered lists into it
[21:14:18] <xp_prg2> any ideas how I do that?
[21:15:40] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: var list = $('<ul/>'); list.append('<li>lorum ipsum'</li>').append('<ul><li>lorum ipsum'</li></ul>');
[21:16:53] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: or you could make a separat dom element for each html tag and append them togeather
[21:17:05] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: or you could concat a long html string and just append that
[21:22:15] <xp_prg2> Cork[home] I want to append a list but then I want to add to the list I appended
[21:22:36] <xp_prg2> how do I get a handle to the list I added?
[21:23:51] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: var new_list = $('<elm>my new html</elm>'); list.append(new_list);
[21:24:23] <xp_prg2> I think I am starting to get it
[21:24:33] <Cork[home]> its the simplest way, else you can use list.find after you'v added it
[21:24:39] <xp_prg2> my brain is trying to understand recursive list approach to construct a tree like structure
[21:25:18] <Cork[home]> what most ppl has a problem with is the destinction between a dom fragment and html
[21:25:41] <xp_prg2> but can't I just keep a handle to the ul dom element and just add more li's to that etc... ?
[21:25:49] <xp_prg2> as well as new ul's ?
[21:25:54] <Cork[home]> sure you can
[21:26:02] <Cork[home]> thats what i did in the first example
[21:26:13] * xp_prg2 hugs Cork *hard*
[21:26:15] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: var list = $('<ul/>'); list.append('<li>lorum ipsum'</li>').append('<ul><li>lorum ipsum'</li></ul>');
[21:26:32] <xp_prg2> its not all platonic either
[21:27:19] <xp_prg2> seriously thanks!
[21:27:37] <Cork[home]> you can even do something like list.append($('<li/>').test('lorum ipsum')) if you prefer that
[21:27:53] <xp_prg2> test?
[21:27:53] <Cork[home]> s/.test/.text/
[21:27:55] <Cogito> hi everyone, any recommendations for handling time input? looking at https://github.com/perifer/timePicker/ which looks pretty good
[21:28:21] <Cogito> looking for simple and mobile/touch compatible
[21:32:28] <Cogito> hmmm http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ looks pretty good too
[21:34:25] <Cork[home]> Cogito: your going to run it along side datepicker?
[21:35:11] <Akuma> hello, I'm trying to get a click event for a class of things, however when I do $('[class⁼myclass_]').click(function(){ alert('x');}); only the first click works
[21:35:17] <Akuma> on a single item
[21:35:32] <tlynch> hello?
[21:35:33] <Akuma> then if I click on any other item having a similar class
[21:35:35] <Akuma> nothing happens
[21:35:59] <Akuma> type: class^=myclass_
[21:36:01] <Cogito> Cork[home]: no, it will only be for time
[21:36:09] <Cork[home]> Akuma: you should be doing .myclass not class=
[21:36:50] <Akuma> it wasn't =
[21:36:55] <Akuma> it was ^=
[21:36:57] <Akuma> typo
[21:37:18] <Cork[home]> Akuma: so you want it to bind to all element except the ones with the class?
[21:37:40] <Akuma> I want to bind all elements for which class starts with "myclass_"
[21:37:41] <xp_prg2> Cork if I have n = $('<li/>');
[21:37:51] <xp_prg2> how do i add the content in between the li?
[21:38:03] <Cork[home]> Akuma: you really, really, REALLY shouldn't be doing that
[21:38:15] <Cork[home]> Akuma: your losing all benefits of using class if you do
[21:38:24] <xp_prg2> figured it out nm
[21:38:42] <Cork[home]> Akuma: add a grouping common class to all of those elements instead
[21:38:45] <Akuma> it can be an id
[21:39:07] <Cork[home]> Akuma: then you can select on that instead, and get all the pre index goodness from the dom
[21:39:10] <Akuma> the point is I can't create a click function for each of my items
[21:39:26] <Cork[home]> Akuma: cause your structuring your html wrong
[21:39:30] <Akuma> I want to all be able to react to a single .click using the jquery selector
[21:39:30] <Cogito> xp_prg2: why are you using <li /> ? If you are doing html5 you don't need the slash - ie just use <li>
[21:39:52] <Cork[home]> xp_prg2: n.html() or n.text()
[21:40:03] <tlynch> Hello everyone, first time here so I do not know the rules..... but my question is, if a 3rd party external script writes to the document using document write, and I want to dynamically add it to the page after the page has loaded, how do I add the script so it executed in the context of the page?
[21:40:04] <xp_prg2> my unorderlist is not indenting at all
[21:40:13] <xp_prg2> what css controls that?
[21:40:25] <tw2113> ul ?
[21:40:28] <xp_prg2> ya
[21:40:30] <tw2113> padding?
[21:40:32] <tw2113> margin?
[21:40:34] <tw2113> text indent?
[21:40:39] <Cork[home]> Cogito: if you don't do <li/> you need to do <li></li>
[21:40:44] <Cork[home]> else you have broken html
[21:40:56] <tw2113> you can omit the </li> Cork[home] ;)
[21:41:01] <xp_prg2> tw2113 ul lists embedded inside of other ul lists naturally indent
[21:41:06] <Cork[home]> tw2113: it depends on the structure
[21:41:09] <xp_prg2> I think it is because I set list-style: none
[21:41:11] <Cork[home]> it sometimes fails
[21:41:23] <tw2113> xp_prg2 that controls the bullets
[21:41:34] <xp_prg2> tw2113 what controls that actual indenting?
[21:41:42] <tw2113> text-indent, padding, margin
[21:41:46] <Cogito> Cork[home]: that is not true, in general
[21:41:57] <Cogito> that is an xhtml idiom, not html5
[21:42:05] <xp_prg2> tw2113 it has always been indented by default before
[21:42:06] <xp_prg2> oh well
[21:42:09] <xp_prg2> thanks tw2113
[21:42:11] <Cogito> ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/li
[21:42:14] <tw2113> something un-indented it then
[21:42:17] <Cork[home]> Cogito: what i meant is the exclusion of </elm>
[21:42:23] <tw2113> use firebug/inspector to look at it
[21:42:34] <Cork[home]> Cogito: and if you use /> it fixes those
[21:43:06] <Cork[home]> the problem is mainly for fragments thought
[21:43:12] <Cogito> if you don't have a closing tag, then you can still use <li>. if you are not allowed to use just <li> you should have a closing tag
[21:43:13] <Cork[home]> *though
[21:43:16] <Cogito> at least in html5
[21:43:22] <tlynch> anyone have experience controlling where or what context a dynically added script tag executes?
[21:43:22] <Cogito> xhtml is different, of course
[21:44:22] <Cork[home]> tlynch: if you append html with jquery you should NEVER use document.write
[21:44:25] <Cogito> tlynch: a script tag will execute as soon as it is rendered
[21:44:46] <Cork[home]> tlynch: cause script tags will be cropped out of the html and executed in head so they will be out of context
[21:45:40] <tlynch> A 3rd party tool called storify forces you to place <script src="___"></script> inline where you would like their story to display
[21:45:48] <tlynch> and it works for a standard page
[21:46:12] <tlynch> (I asked them to change their code so you could set a paramater for where they would append the html and they said no)
[21:46:34] <tlynch> but my pages are loaded via JSON, so the script tag is excuted in the global context
[21:46:34] <Cork[home]> tlynch: you would have to select an element after you've appended the html and do $('selector')[0].innerHTML = '<script>'
[21:47:16] <tlynch> I tried using html() and append() and in both cases the script executed in the head
[21:47:19] <Cork[home]> jquerys append, html, prepend... will look for it and move it if its in the normal html
[21:47:31] <Cork[home]> ya
[21:47:35] <Cork[home]> thats intentional
[21:47:45] <tlynch> ok, I will give innerHTML a shot
[21:49:41] <tlynch> $("#storify")[0].innerHTML = unescape('%3Cscript src="http://storify.com/nicolehollway/loop-media-hub-entertainment-and-media-roundtable.js"%3E%3C/script%3E');
[21:50:58] <tlynch> that appends the script, and I can view it in the DOM, but it did not execute
[21:51:09] <Cork[home]> Cogito: http://www.htmldrive.net/items/demo/1005/like-iPhone-jQuery-scroller-Date-and-Time-picker
[21:51:49] <Cork[home]> tlynch: and its appended as a real dom element and not text?
[21:52:20] <Cork[home]> that is <script> is a dom element and not text added to the page
[21:52:21] <tlynch> let me look
[21:53:01] <tlynch> all I know is using the chrome inspector it appears in the DOM
[21:53:39] <Cork[home]> does the net panel show the loading of the script file?
[21:54:25] <tlynch> no
[21:54:30] <tlynch> the js is not loaded
[21:54:43] <Cork[home]> hmm
[21:59:25] <Akuma> my scripts don't seem to be executed after an ajax call ( the calling piece gets reloaded as the response from the ajax call)
[22:00:26] <Akuma> basically, I can click on an item a first time and it behaves normally, the data is reloaded from the ajax response, but the new list no longer executes the jquery call to click
[22:00:31] <tlynch> if I place <script> ..</script> tags in the content that is returned via JSON it is executed when it is placed in the page, but in the global context
[22:00:47] <tlynch> well, thats because the event is no longer bound to that object
[22:01:16] <tlynch> if you added the event with .on( ) then you can add more elements and it will still handle the event
[22:01:54] <Akuma> instead of .click I would be using .on?
[22:02:05] <Cork[home]> tlynch: script tags is always executed in the global context
[22:02:20] <Cork[home]> tlynch: you want the script tag to have a reference in the dom, thats something else
[22:03:01] <tlynch> right, I was jsut replying to Akuma
[22:04:01] <Akuma> tlynch: I guess the call would be to the parent of the element I'm clicking and not the element itself
[22:04:13] <Akuma> since the element is getting regenrated by the ajax call
[22:04:15] <joobie>                                 $(item).closest('li').remove().fadeOut(800);
[22:04:15] <joobie>  .. the fadeout doesnt work on this, it removes fine though.. any idea why?
[22:05:32] <joobie> nevermind got it
[22:05:53] <Akuma> tlynch: wonderful, it worked
[22:05:56] <Akuma> Thanks
[22:06:01] <tlynch> Akuma - on and live are slightly different in how they function, live gets caught further up the document tree, on is handled at the right place in the propagation as far as I know
[22:07:04] <tlynch> Cork - so, I just tried to look at the javascript that I am trying to write to the page:
[22:07:04] <tlynch> http://storify.com/nicolehollway/loop-media-hub-entertainment-and-media-roundtable.js
[22:07:19] <tlynch> that JS also makes a json call
[22:07:33] <tlynch> (I had to de-obfusicate (sp?) it to see what it did)
[22:07:40] <tlynch> I think this is too big of a mess
[22:07:59] <tlynch> it works perfectly in a static page, placing the script tag where you want it
[22:14:56] <Cork[home]> tlynch: http://jsfiddle.net/HYKP4/6/
[22:15:06] <dman777_alter> does anyone use the estro jquery effect slider?
[22:16:16] <tlynch> CORK - YOU ROCK
[22:16:26] <Mariaa> is there a way to call a function before the execution of function that is associated with window.load ?
[22:16:37] <Cork[home]> i would like to hit the one that wrote that script a bit though
[22:16:48] <Cork[home]> its construction SUCKS
[22:17:03] <tlynch> (I am glad I helped the other guy so that I dont feel like a complete leech)
[22:17:56] <Cork[home]> Mariaa: in some browser you can listen for when the dom is loaded
[22:18:06] <Cork[home]> Mariaa: it will trigger before load
[22:18:17] <Cork[home]> but some ie versions doesn't support it
[22:19:06] <Mariaa> the function attached to window.load is slideshow which takes some time to load, so i was thinking of displaying the first slide there untill the slideshow loads
[22:19:27] <Mariaa> but i surely want something that is compatible with all browsers
[22:19:54] <Cork[home]> Mariaa: best would prob be to generate the first slide in html server side
[22:20:10] <Cork[home]> that way it loads as fast as possible
[22:22:45] * tw2113 waves at Mariaa 
[22:22:56] <Mariaa> to generate the first slide in html and then start the slideshow from slide # 2 Cork[home]?
[22:23:02] <Mariaa> hi tw2113 :)
[22:24:35] <Cork[home]> Mariaa: i meant have the first slide ready positioned in html when the page loads
[22:24:46] <Cork[home]> Mariaa: and then load the slider and let it replace it
[22:25:33] <tlynch> 'night Cork, thanks again
[22:25:45] <Cork[home]> tlynch: gnight
[22:29:40] * tw2113 got to use bacon ipsum tonight
[22:30:50] <dman777_alter> what is the the animation called where I could have like three large squares and one extra large one in the forground while the other 2 in the back...and to switch to the other they would caouresale?
[22:35:12] <Cork[home]> dman777_alter: carousel ex. http://www.webdevelopers.eu/shop/5/demo
[22:39:05] <dman777_alter> Cork[home]: thanks
[22:45:44] <Mariaa> Cork[home]:  $(window).load(function() {  $('.firstslide').remove();  $('.flexslider').flexslider();});
[22:45:58] <Mariaa> i did this, if thats what you meant
[22:46:11] <Cork[home]> ya, that looks fine
[22:49:17] <guy> 'form select[name="ay[category_id]"] option[value="' + data.category + '"]'
[22:49:22] <guy> how do I search by option "label"?
[22:49:45] <guy> <option>this is label</option>
[22:50:52] <Cork[home]> guy: :contains
[22:51:13] <Cork[home]> guy: note though, thats really not a fast way to select things
[22:51:29] <guy> What's the alternative?
[22:51:58] <Cork[home]> why do you need to select by the label?
[22:53:39] <guy> Because while I am storing data in database id,name; the data I am given from Facebook is only Category name. This function is used to pre-fill the form based on app id.
[22:54:52] <guy> So, I have "Games", I need to check if such option is available in my select input and make it the active option accordingly. While the input itself is <option value="some int ID">Games</option>
[22:55:42] <guy> maybe filter() will be faster than contains?
[22:56:29] <Cork[home]> no
[22:56:36] <Cork[home]> it would need :contains
[22:57:07] <Cork[home]> guy: how many options are we talking about, and how often are you going to run the selector?
[22:57:20] <Whirl3d> \me wonders what bacon ipsum is?
[22:57:26] <guy> Not too many (<40), rarely.
[22:57:39] <Cork[home]> guy: use contains
[22:57:58] <Cork[home]> it will be slow, but its few enough elements to no matter much
[22:58:09] <guy> So, this is bad idea?
[22:58:09] <guy> $('form select[name="ay[category_id]"] option').filter(function(){ return $(this).text() == data.category; })
[22:58:32] <Cork[home]> guy: ah the function callback
[22:58:38] <Cork[home]> nope, that works fine too
[22:58:47] <Cork[home]> its prob a little faster then contains
[22:58:57] <Cork[home]> (as contains search for sub strings)
[22:59:13] <guy> Thus I asked, as it seemed so.
[22:59:39] <Cork[home]> guy: didn't think you mean the function callback feature of filter :)
[22:59:44] <Cork[home]> *meant
[23:00:11] <guy> Otherwise it would have been the same as extending the $() query ...
[23:00:23] <Cork[home]> .filter(':contains(' + data.category + ')') vs .contains(data.category)
[23:00:58] <Cork[home]> guy: but ya, the callback is prob the best solution
[23:05:22] <dman777_alter> i like the estro ken burns plug in. i'm kind of new to plugins for jquery. does it come with documentation if i buy it?
[23:26:13] <fivetwentysix> How do I resume the event action after calling preventDefault()?
[23:27:26] <Cork[home]> you can't
[23:27:31] <Cork[home]> you need to retrigger it
[23:27:50] <fivetwentysix> lol ok
[23:27:51] <Cork[home]> this.event_name usually works
[23:27:58] <Cork[home]> *this.event_name()
[23:28:20] <Cork[home]> fivetwentysix: if its click on links it won't though
[23:28:28] <Cork[home]> those are special
[23:28:29] <fivetwentysix> yeah
[23:28:29] <fivetwentysix> doesn't work
[23:28:35] <fivetwentysix> i'm clicking on a button
[23:28:40] <fivetwentysix> maybe i set a variable or something
[23:28:42] <fivetwentysix> to true
[23:28:44] <fivetwentysix> and retrigger yeah?
[23:28:47] <Cork[home]> no
[23:29:04] <Cork[home]> only option is to not set preventDefault until you know it should
[23:29:16] <fivetwentysix> i don't want to set preventDefault
[23:29:24] <fivetwentysix> but it won't execute this ajax request
[23:29:30] <fivetwentysix> before i do it
[23:29:38] <Cork[home]> ah
[23:29:46] <Cork[home]> whats the default action?
[23:29:46] <fivetwentysix> and there's no way for me to ensure the request finishes before going to save...
[23:29:48] <Cork[home]> submit?
[23:29:50] <fivetwentysix> yeah
[23:30:01] <Cork[home]> $('form').submit()
[23:30:08] <fivetwentysix> ah
[23:30:21] <fivetwentysix> but i need to take my button value
[23:30:26] <fivetwentysix> because my form has 2 buttons
[23:30:36] <fivetwentysix> and the server responds to each button value differently
[23:30:39] <Cork[home]> set it in a hidden field
[23:38:13] <Whirl3d> this is going to soudn stupid and I apologize in advance. when you define a method applied to an element's prototype, that method becomes available to all elements made from the same prototype, correct? is there any way to force an object /element to inherit methods from another prototype without wrapping the lement in an instance of the new protype?
[23:38:53] <Whirl3d> I have got to get a new keyboard. sorry
[23:39:29] <defaultro> hey folks, what does $(document).ready mean in jquery?
[23:39:54] <Whirl3d> it means "wait until the dom is loaded before doing the things inside of this function"
[23:40:07] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, i read it okay =) i cant answer it of course as it it is ight years beyond my level, but i understood you =)
[23:40:09] <defaultro> oh ok, thanks a lot
[23:40:23] <coldhead> defaultro: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#Launching_Code_on_Document_Ready
[23:41:08] <defaultro> thanks a lot
[23:42:12] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, thx 8)
[23:44:57] <Whirl3d> It seams like I keep runing into the same pattern over and over and writing the same kinds of code over and over when an abstract class could really provide the functions I keep needing. The pattern is simple: you have a collection of objects that have data associated with them. With the collection, you have one "active" element and the rest are waiting...
[23:45:35] <Lyfesaver> i am running into a similar wall, Whirl3d....
[23:45:38] <Whirl3d> so I am always writing showElement() and hideElement() but in the context of each different kind of element. (say menu items, or slides, or thumbnails, input elements in a form...
[23:45:48] <Lyfesaver> but on much simpler scale
[23:46:41] <defaultro> i think I am going to explode, LOL
[23:47:11] <coldhead> good times
[23:47:14] <coldhead> great friends
[23:47:21] <coldhead> quiznos
[23:47:26] <defaultro> i've been reading a very huge php code which was written in KOhana, plus it has tons of jquery codes which I am very new at :(
[23:47:48] <coldhead> you're gonna make it, defaultro
[23:47:50] <coldhead> hang in there!
[23:47:56] <defaultro> even inserting a simple modal window, I can't do it :(
[23:47:59] <coldhead> we haven't lost anyone yet
[23:48:08] <coldhead> or at least not without hushing it up
[23:48:11] <defaultro> the kohana code is killing me
[23:48:23] <Whirl3d> much to our chagrin
[23:48:24] <coldhead> mmm that's a matter for yourself >: )
[23:48:24] <defaultro> i've been on my pc for almost 18+ hours now
[23:48:36] <tw2113> only 18?
[23:48:38] <tw2113> lightweight
[23:48:45] <defaultro> daily
[23:48:51] <tw2113> i repeat
[23:49:02] <Whirl3d> pshaw. After 18 years, tw2113 and I will talk to you about it. LOL
[23:49:26] <tw2113> i'm 28, and i don't think i was online at 10
[23:49:31] <defaultro> I'm almost a month now and should they be expecting from me especially the app is so huge?
[23:49:37] <tw2113> i was 4 years away in 1993
[23:49:40] <Whirl3d> okay, so I'm old. Rub it in. LOL
[23:49:48] <defaultro> what do you think folks?
[23:49:48] <tw2113> 29?
[23:49:58] <defaultro> or am I just a slow learner?
[23:50:11] <tw2113> i dunno, are you?
[23:50:18] <defaultro> i don't think so
[23:50:31] <Whirl3d> defaultro, coupel of things to consider. One: have you oversold yourself?
[23:50:37] <defaultro> it's just that it's my first time to hear kohana and I also have never used jquery
[23:50:45] <Whirl3d> and two: if not, than maybe it's  a compliment
[23:50:59] <defaultro> no, they told me that as long as i have php skills, it hsould be fine
[23:51:03] <tw2113> i wouldn't expect anyone to master jquery in a month
[23:51:24] <Whirl3d> No, but a good working knowledge in a month is not unreasonable.
[23:51:55] <defaultro> no, i was very busy with the servers, that was for the whole week or even more
[23:52:43] <Whirl3d> Once you understand the model behind jquery, you start to be able to guess methods....it's just the intricate stuff that requires coldhead's input.
[23:52:52] <defaultro> k
[23:53:01] <defaultro> but also kohana which is so confusing
[23:53:15] <Whirl3d> That's gonna be the thing that I, for one, cannot help with
[23:53:21] <tw2113> do remember that php and js are different beasts
[23:53:22] <Whirl3d> I have never ever heard of it.
[23:53:47] <defaultro> i'm studying them both at the same time :( as well as trying to understand the app
[23:54:27] <tw2113> aye, different syntax...you're in for a head of swill
[23:54:43] <tw2113> unless you already have php pretty well
[23:54:43] <coldhead> defaultro: you will struggle to completely understand kohana, and you probably don't need to
[23:54:45] <defaultro> yes, different syntax but I'm understanding it a little now
[23:54:47] <coldhead> just let the magic work
[23:54:52] <Whirl3d> Worry less about the jquery and more about kahona. There are lots of brilliant and generous folks here that can help with jQuery if you are wiling to learn and not fight people when they give you answers.
[23:55:03] <defaultro> ok
[23:55:30] <coldhead> truthiness
[23:56:09] <Whirl3d> Honestly, this group of people is unique and you'll be surprised how supportive people will be. But get the PHP stuff down, so when you ask for help in here, you can know exactly what you are looking for.
[23:56:09] * tw2113 googles "kahona"
[23:56:10] <defaultro> any idea what this line would me
[23:56:12] <defaultro> mean
[23:56:36] <Whirl3d> which line?
[23:56:40] <defaultro> mr.load.register(function() {
[23:56:57] <defaultro> inside is $.window({
[23:56:59] <coldhead> tw2113: it's just a framework like codeigniter
[23:56:59] <defaultro> let me pastebin it
[23:57:04] <tw2113> ah
[23:57:07] <coldhead> a horror to back slowly away from
[23:57:13] <Lyfesaver> lol
[23:57:16] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[23:57:35] <tw2113> i've heard CI isn't in the greatest shape right now too
[23:57:53] <defaultro> pastebin.com/T00fNHhE
[23:58:24] <defaultro> that code I posted opens up a window on left side
[23:58:31] <coldhead> tw2113: i'm at a shop using a joomla install from the 90s
[23:58:40] <coldhead> i YEARN for codeigniter's not great shape
[23:58:48] <defaultro> but the most confusing thing is that, how does it get populated with values
[23:58:49] <coldhead> that would be paradise to me
[23:59:35] <defaultro> did you see the code folks?
[23:59:56] <Whirl3d> defaultro,  are you sure that this is using jQuery? Because lot of architectures use $
