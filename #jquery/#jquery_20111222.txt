[00:14:46] <ximarin> I'll give it a try at least :)
[00:18:14] <tavl> anyone here ever used the jQuery maphilight plugin?
[00:32:31] <tavl> anyone knows how to resize an image map (poly)? couldn't find any robust solution... :(
[00:54:05] <aple> How can I perform an action IF something BECOMES checked?
[00:55:15] <aple> That is, WHEN it becomes checked, like... the second someone checks it BOOM! fire an event!
[00:55:19] <IvanKuzev> i think its a change event
[00:55:29] <IvanKuzev> but you need to check for checked after that
[00:58:57] <aple> k
[00:59:00] <AdvoWork> is there some kind of plugin/similar i can use as a db table editor?meaning if ive got a table with 5 fields, jquery will somehow show/allow editing of those fields?
[01:06:10] <surfdue> whats the most efficient way to do a mass search of all div.path's html to determine if any of them = a certain string.
[01:06:22] <surfdue> i can do .path each, but I am not sure if thats the fastest/most efficient.
[01:09:38] <aple> IvanKuzev: Thanks man! Worked perfect! :)
[01:27:01] <coppa> uh uh http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11096
[01:36:37] <martndemus> I'm trying to create a constructor like object like $("selector"), but I can't figure out how it ends up returning jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[n], because all i can get to is returning jQuery.fn.jQuery.init without the array like index at the end
[01:36:47] <martndemus> does anybody here know?
[01:38:29] <yan_nick> is there a way to do this easier? http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/qKDCB/
[01:40:58] <xec> yan_nick: is that script doing what you want it to do?
[01:43:38] <yan_nick> xec: yo
[01:43:55] <yan_nick> xec: but i do notlike the if else
[01:44:58] <xec> looks fine to me, tbh
[01:45:01] <yan_nick> xec: oh i need to close the .content when you click the h2
[01:45:16] <yan_nick> should i copy the if else part and put it into a bind click function for h2?
[01:46:45] <xec> yan_nick: depends on what you want the behaviour to be, really, you might be better off with two handlers, yes
[01:47:14] <xec> one on h2 to open + prevent bubbling, and one anywhere else to close
[01:47:52] <xec> or rather, the one on h2 you can use toggleClass
[01:48:12] <xec> if you want to be able to close it as well, by clicking the h2
[01:48:32] <yan_nick> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/qKDCB/1/ ?
[01:48:46] <yan_nick> xec: cannot close it by clikcing h2
[01:50:19] <xec> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/2/
[01:51:07] <martndemus> Can anyone with knowledge of how jQuery internally works walk me through how the constructor works?
[01:51:59] <aple> Anyone know how to load 5 posts at a time?
[01:52:04] <xec> i thought jquery was a box of magic
[01:52:06] <aple> Derp wrong channel
[01:52:11] <gloomer> lol
[01:52:21] <Anticom> hi all
[01:52:41] <yan_nick> xec: the block should not close on content clicking
[01:52:43] <yan_nick> .content
[01:53:32] <xec> yan_nick: then bind to h2, not the box...
[01:53:36] <xec> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/3/
[01:53:46] <Anticom> i need a possibility to create multiple instances of a div and remove them all at once again. The problem is, that i don't want to use classes for that, because the manipulated DOM is unknown and i don't want to remove any "native" dom elements, coming with the website already
[01:54:00] <Anticom> any ideas, on how to do that
[01:54:00] <Anticom> ?
[01:57:11] <aple> Anyone know how to load posts with jQuery in WP?
[01:57:16] <xec> yan_nick: removed some of the old code; http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/5/
[01:57:27] <aple> Like "Load 5 more posts"
[01:57:27] <Anticom> aple WP?
[01:57:30] <aple> Wordpress
[01:57:39] <aple> Asking in both channels. :)
[01:57:39] <Anticom> .post() ?
[01:58:03] <Anticom> ah sorry, my fault
[01:58:15] <Anticom> so you mean loading blog entries with jq?
[01:58:30] <Anticom> @ aple
[01:58:53] <Anticom> if that is what you want: build a php wrapper class around it and use $.ajax()
[01:59:26] <aple> Yeah, I'm trying to load 5 posts from a certain category at a time
[01:59:28] <X99> anticom,you mean you want to create some div instances and also can remove them all when you want to ,is it?
[01:59:34] <aple> What do you mean php wrapper class?
[01:59:44] <Anticom> X99 yea
[02:00:05] <Anticom> x99 i've thought about storing the dom references in an array but dno how to do that
[02:00:17] <Anticom> aple: or since wordpress has rss support you could try to get the rss stream an parse the xml
[02:01:05] <Anticom> aple with php wrapper class i mean a custom class, catching the stuff out of the db, format it the way you want (JSON e.g.) and display it so you can catch it with ajax
[02:03:09] <X99> I think you can use a temp var to save the total of the div, and add the id number to every div,it looks like <div id="id_N"></div>
[02:03:20] <X99> @Anticom
[02:04:02] <X99> so when you want to remove them all ,just for $("#id_" + i).remove() :)
[02:04:58] <Anticom> x99 haha but i neither want to use id's because of same problem
[02:05:08] <Anticom> and removing is not the problem (:
[02:05:31] <Anticom> it's about instanciating a new jq div object, make it visible and store the reference in an array
[02:06:06] <xec> that shouldn't be too hard?
[02:06:15] <xec> not that i have tried :P
[02:06:47] <Anticom> xec neither do i :D but i realy have no clue on how to do that like PROPERLY
[02:06:48] <martndemus> Nobody here knows how jQuery internally works? :(
[02:06:49] <X99> um...I'm not very clear.sorry
[02:07:07] <Anticom> quick and dirty, yea, but i as a wise man once said: don't write code today, that you can not debug tomorrow ;)
[02:07:27] <Anticom> martndemus ?
[02:07:37] <Anticom> just load the dev version and take a look
[02:07:52] <aple> Anticom: Catching stuff out of the DB? This seems above me . :)
[02:08:03] <martndemus> Anticom: yeah im looking, but i can't figure out a step that the constructor function makes
[02:08:41] <Anticom> aple then try the rss stuff or ask at wp, wether there's any plugin to generate JSON formatted blog posts
[02:09:17] <xec> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/6/
[02:09:42] <aple> Thanks Anticom
[02:12:28] <xec> Anticom: in an array: http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/7/
[02:13:16] <Anticom> xec that's what i came up with: http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/8/
[02:13:37] <Anticom> but somehow it's adding wrong
[02:13:54] <Anticom> and removing doesn't work at all lol
[02:14:06] <Kambfhase> never use `new Array()`. use [].
[02:14:22] <Kambfhase> elements.length is not a function
[02:14:35] <xec> well, you keep cloning the clones
[02:15:26] <Anticom> xec there you go: <div class="sample">sample</div>
[02:15:28] <Anticom> oops
[02:15:33] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/9/
[02:15:54] <Anticom> Kambfhase thanks, seen that myself... but why don't use new Array()?
[02:16:23] <Kambfhase> its slowwer, bad API design and bad style.
[02:17:20] <Anticom> Kambfhase well, it's more the OOP style i'd say
[02:17:20] <Kambfhase> btw, if your buttons have IDs simply do $('#add') much faster.
[02:17:36] <Anticom> Kambfhase it's not about performance
[02:17:40] <Anticom> it's about proper code
[02:17:51] <Anticom> and this was only an example piece
[02:18:01] <xec> how is [] not proper code
[02:18:03] <xec> anyway
[02:18:04] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/qKDCB/10/
[02:18:15] <xec> just modified your remove function
[02:18:35] <Anticom> xec i wanted to remove them all at once ;)
[02:18:41] <xec> oh okay
[02:18:42] <xec> hehe
[02:18:43] <Anticom> so it was right alreayd
[02:18:46] <Anticom> dy*
[02:18:47] <Anticom> :P
[02:18:54] <Anticom> but thank's for your approach
[02:19:00] <Anticom> brb
[02:19:11] <Kambfhase> why dont you just use .empty() ?
[02:20:24] <dirkpennings> when I'm trying to call a function $.showLoader() in my document.ready() it fails "$.showLoader() is not a function".. my function is within my $.extend() part of the script. what can I do to fix this? settimeout? load the extends before my document ready fires?
[02:21:25] <Kambfhase> load the extends before my document ready fires? << I'd prefer this
[02:24:18] <surfdue> can you use javascript on a jquery variable? for example $(this).attr('rel').replace('foo', 'bar');
[02:24:58] <sheldonh> jquery makes a lot more sense after chapter 4 (functions) of JavaScript: The Good Parts
[02:25:01] <dirkpennings> Kambfhase, ok so when I place my $.extend() part above my document.ready it is solved, or is it still possible to have a "timing" problem?
[02:25:40] <Kambfhase> dirkpennings: timing problems are alwayys possible. but thats what I'd tryed.
[02:25:47] <xec> surfdue: yes. .attr('rel') will return a (js) string
[02:25:57] <surfdue> xec: hey your up late
[02:25:58] <surfdue> :)
[02:26:10] <xec> actually, it's lunchtime now :)
[02:26:16] <surfdue> xec: REALLY?
[02:26:24] <surfdue> xec: i never showed you my grand scheme :)
[02:26:39] <surfdue> i have shown Eviltwin :)
[02:26:56] <dirkpennings> Kambfhase, will try to put it above the doc.ready..  thanx :)
[02:26:56] <xec> will it enslave the world?
[02:27:03] <surfdue> xec: + more
[02:27:09] <xec> awesome :D
[02:27:14] <Kambfhase> np, and good luck.
[02:27:19] <surfdue> xec: wanna see?
[02:27:23] <xec> sure
[02:27:27] <surfdue> ok ill pm u in a secon
[02:27:31] <surfdue> second, need to push it :)
[02:28:31] <xec> salt-n-pepa style
[02:32:48] <dirkpennings> Kampfhase, seems to solve my issue
[02:32:50] <dirkpennings> :)
[02:35:24] <surfdue> xec: before I show you i have to finish this one function
[02:35:37] <surfdue> whats the most efficient way to do a mass search of all div.path's html to determine if any of them = a certain string.
[02:35:44] <surfdue> i can do .path each, but I am not sure if thats the fastest/most efficient.
[02:40:12] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query and js. i have a problem: on document ready, i create several absolute positioned divs sometimes their outside of the visible area. but it seems that the body on which they are append doesn't change in its size. its still that big as the visible browser area â€¦ someone a hint how to fix that?
[02:41:50] <xec> mightym: this has more to do with the way css works than js/jquery
[02:42:45] <mightym> xec: sure, but do i have to calculate the body hight on my on depending on my elements and adjust it with js?
[02:43:52] <xec> if I was you i would reconsider using absolute positioning, tbh, but of course you can set a height/width with js
[02:44:18] <xec> ?height @ mightym
[02:44:18] <bot-t> mightym, .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[02:44:45] <xec> you can also *set* the height by supplying a value
[02:45:50] <mightym> xec: yes, the question was more if i have to. and yes i need to position them absolute cause they are draggable elements. thx a lot for your help!
[02:46:05] <AdvoWork> is there some kind of plugin/similar i can use as a db table editor?meaning if ive got a table with 5 fields, jquery will somehow show/allow editing of those fields?
[02:49:46] <xec> mightym: i don't think you need position: absolute; for draggables?
[02:51:30] <xec> AdvoWork: you can probably find some grid plugin that will do that, http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35122722/Grid-OtherGrids
[02:56:44] <mazzachre> When making a jqueryui widget, is it possible to get a function run only once... I am creating a dialog for a widget, and I don't want to create a new dialog for each instantiation, one should suffice
[02:57:38] <fadeh> hello, got an issue I can't really figure out by myself. It should be something really stupid but... I'm using jquery tabs to display some tabs (brilliant) and all works fine except the content inside the tabs, which has some html tags, doesn't display correctly (for example: <strong> tags doesn't render at all etc). Did anyone have the same problem?
[02:58:17] <IvanKuzev> mazzachre make a check for the dialog before initialization
[02:58:53] <fadeh> [I checked with firebug that the all the tags are passed correctly in the jquery tab content]
[02:59:46] <mazzachre> IvanKuzev: hmmm, ok
[03:08:49] <martndemus> Is there someone here that knows the jQuery source inside out and can explain me how a part of the $() constructor works?
[03:14:45] <stergium> to_anyone_that_could_know: is there a way to make .toggle() use rightclick instead of click event?
[03:16:33] <martndemus> I think the event object from $('elem').click(function(event) {}) has a property that returns the button clicked
[03:17:49] <dr0id> bind a click event and on e.which == 3 toggle
[03:18:32] <woozly> how to trigger moving div outside of container in .sortable() ?
[03:18:33] <stergium> dr0id doent toggle need a click event to .. .toggle?
[03:18:45] <woozly> I want to move element outside of box and remove it
[03:20:26] <aple> Hey guys, this keeps getting returned as NaN http://paste.pocoo.org/show/524453/
[03:20:48] <aple> I define var offset, then try to auto increment it, but for some reason it's returning NaN :(
[03:21:29] <stergium> aple try setting a starting value for offset
[03:21:34] <Kambfhase> well
[03:21:41] <Kambfhase> oofset is undefined.
[03:21:43] <Jee5us_work> aple - u have no value for offset
[03:21:48] <Kambfhase> ?eval undefined + 1
[03:21:49] <bot-t> Kambfhase: NaN
[03:25:05] <poppiez> I'm trying to .animate() a width using a percentage value. isn't this possible?
[03:26:03] <mightym> does someone know if i can use the query draggable stack management on click?
[03:28:37] <s0u][ight> hi guys, what is wrong with this snippet? http://pastebin.com/8sXC4565
[03:38:40] <arRoo> What is the best way to determine the <li> with the biggest height in a <ul>? At the moment I am iterating through <li>'s with .each() and checking each element individually, but I wonder if there's a better solution
[03:43:03] <aple> Thanks guys
[03:46:52] <aple> Is there a clever way to append loaded data into a div?
[03:47:24] <aple> That is, I have this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/524460/
[03:47:39] <aple> And when I click it, I can get it to add to the offset and load said post
[03:48:01] <aple> But I'd really like for it to simply add the post onto the end of the stuff that's already there.
[03:48:03] <Theaxiom> Anyone here familiar with extjs/sencha touch?
[03:48:12] <Theaxiom> the people in the #extjs channel are worthless idlers
[03:53:14] <poppiez> I'm trying to .animate() a width using a percentage value. isn't this possible?
[04:02:17] <poppiez> nvm, got it working
[04:03:38] <mightym> or maybe is there a way to bind a on click event to the drag event of query draggable?
[04:06:55] <BinaryKitten> arRoo still want the tallest Li?
[04:07:24] <arRoo> BinaryKitten: well yeah, was just asking if there was a better option performance-wise, can't really imagine how iterating would give me the best performance
[04:07:29] <BinaryKitten> filter
[04:07:42] <BinaryKitten> in theory it's the still the same
[04:08:24] <BinaryKitten> bare with me... though.. have an idea.. going to test it on fiddle
[04:10:26] <mightym> well thank you anyway!
[04:13:34] <arRoo> BinaryKitten: any luck :p?
[04:13:50] <mazzachre> If I make a dialog in the constructor of a widget, how do I open that dialog in a function in the widget?
[04:13:52] <BinaryKitten> just putting the html/css in .. now the js
[04:16:01] <mazzachre> Also, I seem to be doing this wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/QLsjR/
[04:16:41] <BinaryKitten> arRoo seems that a .each is the only way
[04:17:01] <BinaryKitten> if you already knew the tallest then .filter woul work
[04:17:43] <arRoo> BinaryKitten: no I don't, that's the main reason why I am doing the each() iteration ... http://pastebin.com/2zU2jfQX
[04:18:33] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/3KZHR/ = filter
[04:18:39] <arRoo> just seems a bit odd, it felt as if there'd be a jquery function that'd do a better job
[04:18:54] <BinaryKitten> arRoo internally it would have to loop anyway
[04:19:17] <arRoo> yeah I guess that's true :P
[04:19:52] <BinaryKitten> arRoo drop lines 3,4 and 5
[04:20:22] <arRoo> lol yeah, they're not needed
[04:20:23] <BinaryKitten> also the else on 6
[04:20:41] <BinaryKitten> i do that all the time as well, that's why i noticed it
[04:22:22] <arRoo> it's a silly mistake of the mind, no point checking for 0 if you already know it's going to be smaller than your height()
[04:22:47] <arRoo> it's not really a mistake, just redundant coding :p
[04:23:38] <BinaryKitten> arRoo yes..
[04:23:49] <BinaryKitten> redundant code gets cleaned up at the end
[04:24:02] <BinaryKitten> also..
[04:24:04] <arRoo> hehe doubt it'll all get cleaned up in this project
[04:24:08] <BinaryKitten> small improvement arRoo
[04:24:17] <BinaryKitten> let me update the pastebin
[04:26:46] <BinaryKitten> arRoo http://pastebin.com/M0cF4DBE
[04:27:26] <arRoo> BinaryKitten: when you said you saw an improvement I already knew what you meant
[04:27:31] <arRoo> I did it different though :)
[04:27:40] <BinaryKitten> :)
[04:27:53] <BinaryKitten> how did you do it?
[04:27:55] <arRoo> http://pastebin.com/6xJS2P3C
[04:28:00] <arRoo> think that's even shorter/faster
[04:28:19] <BinaryKitten> meh
[04:28:42] <BinaryKitten> i prefer more verbosity
[04:29:00] <BinaryKitten> mainly because my eyes don't see the if chaning the maxHeight
[04:29:05] <arRoo> don't think it'll matter much as it's such a simple operation :P
[04:29:19] <BinaryKitten> true, in the end 1 dom search is better
[04:29:21] <arRoo> I usually like more verbosity too
[04:29:28] <BinaryKitten> if you can, reduce the selector
[04:29:51] <arRoo> I can't hehe, only needs to work for that specific one :)
[04:30:16] <BinaryKitten> is there more than 1 #overview ?
[04:30:42] <ohcibi> http://jsfiddle.net/afmzp/ is it not possible to get this css-definition?
[04:31:20] <BinaryKitten> ohcibi is that a valid style?
[04:31:36] <arRoo> on every page, yes, but now that I see it, I can remove some of the selector's path
[04:31:50] <arRoo> but we're talking <50ms I'm sure
[04:31:55] <arRoo> <20ms even I think
[04:32:00] <BinaryKitten> on every page load?
[04:32:08] <arRoo> it's only on 1 page
[04:32:21] <BinaryKitten> in the end, it's best practice
[04:32:25] <arRoo> I know, you're right
[04:32:33] <BinaryKitten> if you decide to go against it, then that's cool too :p
[04:32:34] <arRoo> always try to reduce everything to minimum
[04:32:42] <ohcibi> BinaryKitten: its a css3-style... used on NetTV browsers
[04:33:36] <ohcibi> BinaryKitten: but it seems like only the opera tv simulator is supporting it 8-) thats why i need the value to implement a js-solution, could put the information into data-attributes, but i dont like that
[04:33:39] <BinaryKitten> are you running that code on NetTv browsers?
[04:34:05] <BinaryKitten> because as you just said other browsers won't support it
[04:34:19] <BinaryKitten> if they don't support it .css won't be able to retreive it
[04:34:22] <ohcibi> BinaryKitten: i'm running it in the opera tv simulator..
[04:34:37] <BinaryKitten> css talks to the style property of the element. not the style attribute
[04:34:39] <ohcibi> BinaryKitten: it supports the style (as it influences the navigation-flow)
[04:34:53] <BinaryKitten> sorry .css talks to....
[04:35:15] <surfdue> hey BinaryKitten
[04:35:17] <ohcibi> BinaryKitten: yes okay, i got it, wont work in the fiddle.. but the tv simulator is using the style (navigation works) but the property is still empty
[04:35:54] <BinaryKitten> ohcibi have you tried on the actual system
[04:36:05] <BinaryKitten> because there might be an issue with the simulator
[04:36:14] <ohcibi> (also as far is i read its not meant to be a nettv-special style but a css3-style so it should be supported anyways actually)
[04:36:24] <BinaryKitten> but it is beyond what i can do to help, sorry
[04:36:30] <ohcibi> no problem
[04:36:45] <BinaryKitten> ooh
[04:36:49] <BinaryKitten> try navUp
[04:37:12] <BinaryKitten> normalisation of hyphenated items
[04:37:16] <BinaryKitten> hey surfdue
[04:37:36] <BinaryKitten> yay! the bot's back!

[04:42:49] <sheldonh> will this bind an event handler to all elements that have class foo applied? $(".foo").bind("click", function(e) {...});
[04:43:08] <ravenzz> yes
[04:43:50] <sheldonh> and a console.log("got event") inside the event handler should show up in the firebug console's All tab?
[04:44:38] <ravenzz> what do you mean by saying "All"
[04:45:15] <sheldonh> ravenzz: firebug's console has tabs All, Errors, Warnings, Info, Debug Info. i expected to see my console.log("got click") show up in the All tab
[04:45:20] <ravenzz> ah yes
[04:45:51] <ravenzz> anyway if you are binding that click event on anchors
[04:45:52] <sheldonh> weird. doesn't show up, and yet doing something deliberately stupid in the event handler displays an error message in the tab
[04:45:58] <ravenzz> you should prevent its default action
[04:46:05] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ sheldonh
[04:46:05] <bot-t> sheldonh, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[04:46:46] <sheldonh> ravenzz: i don't think i have a default action. it's a button not a submit. but let me read and do and see, thanks
[04:46:55] <beepbeep_> onChange of a select tag, is there an easy way to access to previous value?
[04:46:55] <ravenzz> k
[04:48:23] <sheldonh> ravenzz: argh! everything's working fine, i just needed to double-tap refresh. i hate that about modern browsers. thanks for the help! :)
[04:48:47] * sheldonh <3 $(event.target).parent()
[04:49:29] <sheldonh> oooo. clone() doesn't clone handlers. fun times :)
[04:49:44] <jeffsmykil> is there something wrong with this? $(".logo").effect("pulsate", {times:5}, 3000);
[04:50:19] <beepbeep_> sheldonh, it does
[04:50:29] <beepbeep_> first parameter of clone() method
[04:50:38] <beepbeep_> withDataAndEventsA Boolean indicating whether event handlers should be copied along with the elements. As of jQuery 1.4, element data will be copied as well.
[04:51:04] <sheldonh> god, this is so much better than prototype!
[04:51:33] <Jon47> ha!  I remeber the same feeling
[04:52:31] <sheldonh> i love that the design prefers unchecked failures, so i don't keep having to check whether my selector found something. brilliant
[04:53:01] <Jon47> one big thing I disliked about prototype was the heinous syntax for invoking a method on each member of a collection of elements
[04:53:08] <nisseni> how can I refresh a div after a call?
[04:53:17] <Jon47> nisseni - what do you mean by "refresh" a div?
[04:53:41] <sheldonh> Jon47: yeah! iteration by default. genius!
[04:54:32] <nisseni> Jon47: I have a table with som entries, I add an entry to the db via a call, when I refresh the page I get the new entry in the table, but I want to refresh the table after the call is made and the entry is in the db
[04:55:07] <Jon47> Nisseni - there are a million answers to your question
[04:55:17] <nisseni> Jon47: I only need one
[04:56:12] <Jon47> use ajax to make the call and update the div using javascript
[04:56:56] <sheldonh> nisseni: maybe you could write a callback for this? http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[04:57:03] <jeffsmykil> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> should include the effect package
[04:57:06] <jeffsmykil> right?
[04:57:08] <Jon47> personally I'd recommend having the db service respond using json
[04:59:06] <Hackwar> hi folks, I have a loading issue... I'm resizing a background image upon DOMready, but its not always working.
[04:59:27] <Hackwar> every X times it simply shows the image without resizing
[05:05:38] <richardjprice> hello, what is a good way of kindof attaching some html to the coordinates where mousedown event was called
[05:08:55] <sheldonh> struggling to find the answer to this in the docs... does jquery support xpath selectors?
[05:10:13] <cheater> hi guys
[05:10:53] <sheldonh> oooo. firebug has $x(xpath-selector). nevermind :)
[05:11:02] <cheater> i have a fairly complex page here with some jquery which is being triggered when it shouldn't. it makes an element disappear when i click on another element and i'd like to debug it, specifically find which function is being triggered and how to turn it off. can someone help me figure out how to do this in firebug?
[05:11:42] <cheater> i hadn't done fron-end stuff in some time so i could be a bit rusty with all the new-fangled doohickeys
[05:11:58] <cheater> but i guess i just need to be able to trace where the onclick is being handled
[05:19:36] <logicrises> cheater, has the element got a class or id
[05:20:17] <logicrises> cheater, the reason I ask is because you could search this within firebug script tab... its very fast and cool
[05:21:27] <cheater> logicrises: the disappearing element is a label, so i can perhaps search for that. the element firing the event is an input. they have no ids or classes.
[05:22:05] <logicrises> have you got a URL?
[05:23:52] <cheater> logicrises: unfortunately no
[05:24:01] <cheater> i can also not create a minimal case
[05:24:10] <cheater> i think i've found the event using Eventbug
[05:24:19] <cheater> however, it's minified.
[05:24:27] <cheater> need to find the real source now.
[05:24:55] <cheater> hmm..
[05:25:08] <sheldonh> does minification save more bandwidth charges than it costs developer time? :(
[05:25:14] <cheater> however, the focus event handler is defined inside jquery.min.js
[05:25:19] <cheater> so i'm guessing that's part of jquery
[05:25:39] <logicrises> cheater, it could be a number of things
[05:25:56] <logicrises> Its prob how jquery is being used rather than jquery... whats the version
[05:31:06] <joris> Hi. Is there a shorthand for animating an element at an angle?
[05:31:17] <surfdue> erg
[05:31:21] <joris> I don't want to rotate the element, just have it slide over a line that is at an angle
[05:31:32] <surfdue> Eviltwin: you still asleep
[05:31:36] <surfdue> I need a jquery expert lol
[06:00:49] <juha_> has anyone seen this sort of issue with google maps + jquery hovering, that when the popup on the map icon opens, you hover the popup and if there's an icon under the popup, it hovers that icon (even though it's under other element) and the popup moves to that icon..
[06:07:44] <cheater> woop, found it, thanks guys
[06:07:59] <cheater> logicrises: thx :)
[06:09:48] <zungmou> :-D
[06:12:34] <myzf> is there a event for a inputbox when a value would insert?
[06:13:55] <fris> myzf .change
[06:14:11] <myzf> thanks
[06:14:37] <zungmou> this is a basic question
[06:17:00] <surfdue> yawn i was up all night
[06:18:12] <zungmou> surfdue what's up?
[06:18:17] <surfdue> zungmou: nm you
[06:18:26] <surfdue> got a MAJOR issue delaying my further development atm.
[06:18:33] <surfdue> I have no idea how to fix this bug. its terrible -.-
[06:19:08] <zungmou> what kind of your bug?
[06:19:55] <surfdue> zungmou: some sort of javascript/css bug with Ace (aka skywriter, aka bespin)
[06:20:10] <surfdue> it just started recently too. so I def caused it, with css I think..
[06:29:45] <sheldonh> jquery-ui is awesome. two lines of javascript, and my list is sortable. mmmmm
[06:30:08] <surfdue> sheldonh: lol
[06:30:54] <dr0id> I wish they wanted us to write 3 lines :/
[06:32:11] <sheldonh> hmmm. my sortable is a fieldset containing divs. the divs contain inputs. when i try to drag an input, an input outside the sortable receives focus, and i can't drag?
[06:32:33] <recentlydeceased> hi folks, using autocmplete in a search box and trying to get specific list elements to have a certain class added to them, depending on what they are.  the numerous list options have a bunch of array data - one of which is 'style'
[06:33:11] <xrated> Can you re-create these things in jsfiddle??
[06:33:13] <xrated> ?*
[06:34:18] <recentlydeceased> say I have 'style' => 'baseball' for some items annd 'style' => 'rounders' for others, I want to be able to style the baseball items by adding a class.  I'm a complete js noob, any help?
[06:35:17] <recentlydeceased> at the moment I have $("ul li").addClass(item.style); -- but it's applying that class to ALL the list items!
[06:36:16] <xrated> recentlydeceased:  $("ul li.baseball").addClass(item.style)
[06:36:17] <recentlydeceased> to clarify, it's adding 'baseball' as a style to EVERY list item, even the ones that don't have 'style' => 'baseball' set
[06:36:20] <xrated> Is that what you mean?
[06:36:44] <recentlydeceased> 2 secs
[06:36:44] <sheldonh> PEBKAK: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4429
[06:39:08] <recentlydeceased> xrated, no.... I mean I have a bunch of arrays (baseball, rounders, etc) that are all merged and sent via ajax to the autocomplete search function
[06:40:46] <recentlydeceased> I have added 'style' to one of these arrays (baseball), and I want to then apply this 'style' to the relevant array items that are shown in the search results, but at present the style applies to all data in the array
[06:42:47] <recentlydeceased> rephrase that last part... the style applies to every single result -- every single array item from every array (even the ones with no 'style' set)
[06:44:56] <MysterOnyx> anyone good with jplayer?
[06:46:37] <recentlydeceased> xrated, any ideas?  I realise my descriptive skills are somewhat lacking :/
[06:46:53] <xrated> Sorry, I wasn't reading. I'm in the office.
[06:47:17] <xrated> I don't know off-hand what would be your problem, if I had more time to help you I would try. My advice it to replicate this on jsfiddle
[06:47:23] <xrated> And post it here
[06:47:26] <xrated> Someone else is help
[06:47:58] <kborchers> recentlydeceased: r u using the UI autocomplete?
[06:48:29] <MysterOnyx> could someone check out my jsfiddle? I'm trying to figure out why the 2nd sound plays on the first jplayer... http://jsfiddle.net/xMEaq/
[06:49:49] <recentlydeceased> kborchers, yeah
[06:50:14] <surfdue> hwllo kborchers
[06:50:33] <kborchers> recentlydeceased: ok, what you'll need to do is write a custom _renderItem to apply the styles when necessary
[06:50:42] <kborchers> check out http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[06:50:49] <kborchers> that should put you on the right track
[06:50:55] <kborchers> hi surfdue
[06:50:59] <surfdue> kborchers: how are you
[06:51:10] <recentlydeceased> kborchers, thank you!
[06:51:15] <kborchers> np
[06:51:29] <kborchers> surfdue: fine u
[06:51:43] <surfdue> kborchers: decent... just really frustrated with a certain js plugin
[06:53:14] <kborchers> surfdue: yeah, saw that. unfortunately not too familiar with Ace. what's the issue?
[06:53:35] <surfdue> kborchers: i believe its more of a css issue, but it needs someone with that jquery/javascript experience to debug it
[06:53:42] <Nomikos> I'm using .each() to style some elements, and add hover events for them, both based on width of content. But then one can also add more elements dynamically, how do I each() those? .live() isn't gonna work I think?
[06:53:55] <surfdue> kborchers: seems that depending on the size of the browser window when the tabs switch (hide/show) it causes the editor to mess up.
[06:54:26] <kborchers> u have a link?
[06:54:50] <Nomikos> Is there a way to run some function on new elements (by class/selector) as they appear on the page?
[06:55:36] <surfdue> kborchers: ya its got a login though i can pm it to you
[06:55:44] <kborchers> ok
[06:55:45] * Nomikos learns live() is deprecated
[06:55:56] <kborchers> Nomikos: use .on()
[06:56:07] <Nomikos> yeah. same question though :)
[06:56:32] <Nomikos> I don't think there's an event for "appears on page", not sure how to do it
[06:57:11] <Pilate> there are mutation events, but you should be fine with either .delegate or .on
[06:57:24] <Nomikos> "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on()."
[06:57:38] <Nomikos> I'll look at delegate
[06:57:47] <kborchers> Nomikos: assuming you are adding the elements to the dom, you can run your function at that time on those elements
[06:58:06] <Nomikos> kborchers: .. why didn't I think of that.
[07:01:05] <mazzachre> OK, worked more on it... http://jsfiddle.net/QLsjR/3/ Now I am kind of stuck... How do I open the dialog in the function? using dialog.dialog("open"); does nothing...
[07:03:52] <mazzachre> Can anyone help with this?
[07:05:07] <IvanKuzev> three.js
[07:05:17] <IvanKuzev> ops.i meant to tyope join
[07:07:43] <mazzachre> Also, I can't quite figure out what to do with event handling here... Like, from the button handler, how do I set the options? And on option update, how do I make the widget reflect that?
[07:08:04] <recentlydeceased> kborchers, this is what I've been given to work with, do I need to completely rewrite the renderItem code?
[07:08:43] <sphinxxx> can you not pass an xml file direclty to .parsexml ?
[07:09:39] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/q3XBx/
[07:10:49] <Nomikos> test.xml would need to sit in the root of the user's computer?
[07:11:41] <Nomikos> or, ehrm. I mean.. try getting the data with .get()
[07:12:27] <kborchers> recentlydeceased: you should be able to copy that example i gave you, do a check for the item.style and if it exists, add it to the li and you're good to go
[07:12:56] <recentlydeceased> kborchers, ok, I'll dive into it... ;)
[07:13:29] <sphinxxx> ah that works, thanks
[07:14:09] <MysterOnyx> anyone here use jplayer?
[07:14:34] <timing> MysterOnyx: yeah moi
[07:14:55] <timing> MysterOnyx: started with it a few weeks ago, it's awesome :-)
[07:15:37] <MysterOnyx> timing do you think you could eyeball some code to figure out why mine's not working?
[07:17:12] <NoiseEee> whats more expensive?  initializing var a = $('#id').selectorStuffEtc()  or  starting with an existing jquery object, but needing to do a bunch of parent(.selector) and children(.selector) to get to that same #id ?
[07:17:21] <Nomikos> Is there an equivalent for .each() when you /know/ there will be only be one element in the set?
[07:17:41] <xrated> NoiseEee, it's almost always more efficient to select by id than anything else since it uses the universally supported getElementById
[07:18:06] <NoiseEee> and i shouldn't be concerned about the new jquery object
[07:18:56] <xrated> No, I mean. You could do some QUnit tests to see if your .parent('selector here') is faster than '#blah blah'
[07:19:05] <xrated> But in either case you'll get a new jQuery object returned.
[07:19:17] <timing> MysterOnyx: sure, where is the code?
[07:19:25] <timing> MysterOnyx: and also, did you read the docs?
[07:20:04] <NoiseEee> xrated: merci
[07:20:11] <MysterOnyx> http://jsfiddle.net/xMEaq/ - I have read the docs, and I still cannot figure out why this is happening. The problem is that the 2nd sound file is being played by the first player, and the 2nd player doesn't work. If I remove the 2nd player, the 1st sound correctly plays in the 1st player.
[07:20:15] <xrated> No worries.
[07:21:45] <mazzachre> Anyone who can point me in the right direction? How do I open the created dialog? And how do I trigger the setting of options from that dialog in my own widget? (dialog internally used in widget) http://jsfiddle.net/QLsjR/3/
[07:22:17] <Pilate> MysterOnyx: why in the world are you adding so much html via JS
[07:22:47] <MysterOnyx> pilate I didn't want to add it via php
[07:22:59] <MysterOnyx> figured if I'm using jscript for everything else, I might as well stick with it
[07:23:14] <Pilate> facepalm
[07:23:22] <MysterOnyx> do you have another solution?
[07:24:00] <ethicalhack3r> Hi, I was wondering if anybody could help. I would like to call the 'loadPopup()' function in http://webwordcount.com/js/popup.js when scanStatus == 'limit' in http://webwordcount.com/js/count.js
[07:24:05] <kborchers> mazzachre: you open a dialog with .dialog("open"); you set options with .dialog("option", optionName, value); ... it's all in the docs
[07:24:14] <kborchers> ?ui.dialog @ mazzachre
[07:24:15] <bot-t> mazzachre, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[07:24:54] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Wasn't asleep but just got to my machine
[07:25:11] <MysterOnyx> Pilate I'm somewhat new to javascript.. what's the better way to add all of the html?
[07:25:14] <Eviltwin> surfdue: And you're supposed to just ask your questions, not look for topic experts
[07:25:17] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[07:25:18] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:25:22] <kborchers> well, looks like i can retire because Eviltwin has arrived ;)
[07:25:38] <Eviltwin> Eviltwin will be in and out
[07:26:33] <Eviltwin> So don't go anywhere :P
[07:26:35] <StPiere> what does this select : $('> div', this) ??
[07:26:41] <StPiere> thats from an plugin
[07:26:43] <kborchers> heh
[07:26:53] <Eviltwin> StPiere: Any div that's an immediate child of the element in "this"
[07:26:53] <mazzachre> kborchers: Ya, I know, I can read the docs... Now I make a widget that creates a dialog pr. instantiation, it creates this dialog in the constructor but I can't then reference the dialog from other functions in the widget... So that is what I am asking
[07:27:08] <ethicalhack3r> If anyone can help me I can donate £10 to them or their charity of choice. My JS/Jquery skills suck and I don't have the time to learn it right now.
[07:27:08] <StPiere> thanks
[07:27:13] <Eviltwin> StPiere: I'm pretty sure UI dialog uses something like that at one point
[07:27:30] <mazzachre> kborchers: And from the window (when open...) when I finish using it, how do I get back to the widget that triggered the opening in the first place, in order to trigger it's settings?
[07:27:36] <surfdue> Eviltwin: yatta yatta.
[07:27:41] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, help how?
[07:27:43] <surfdue> Eviltwin: your the only guy I think can fix it.
[07:27:50] <surfdue> and I cannot move forward till i fix it :(
[07:27:57] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: Hi, I was wondering if anybody could help. I would like to call the 'loadPopup()' function in http://webwordcount.com/js/popup.js when scanStatus == 'limit' in http://webwordcount.com/js/count.js
[07:28:58] <timing> MysterOnyx: I don't get it
[07:29:02] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, what is the problem then?
[07:29:14] <timing> MysterOnyx: what's up with all that html generated by js?
[07:29:34] <Eviltwin> ethicalhack3r: You mean you want to run some code when scanStatus changes?
[07:29:42] <timing> MysterOnyx: which play button do I have to click?
[07:30:00] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: loadPopup() doesn't trigger when scanStatus = 'limit' (when I put loadPopup() in the else if)
[07:30:16] <WholemealLoaf> NoiseEee, I was mildy curious too. Here's a spurious example to compare performance. (It would obv depend on what kind of traversal you'd be doing to get the second element) http://jsperf.com/two-jquery-selections-vs-one-with-traversal
[07:30:19] <timing> MysterOnyx: also, maybe you should change the fiddle so the locations of the audio files are accessible
[07:30:36] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, can i see the html file?
[07:30:39] <JSM87> Hi guys, I have 8 images, 2 in each row. I only want 4 visible at any time but i want to use jquery to scroll through them. is there a good plugin that can do this. jquery cycle is the right type of idea but thats based on scrolling 1 image at a time
[07:30:49] <kkuno> hi
[07:30:50] <NoiseEee> hey thanks WholemealLoaf :)
[07:30:53] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: sure, 2secs
[07:31:00] <kkuno> I have a list with a length
[07:31:05] <kkuno> how can I erase it?
[07:31:09] <Eviltwin> WholemealLoaf: I would nix the console.log's
[07:31:14] <WholemealLoaf> NoiseEee, np. Realised I probably traverse more than I need to as well.
[07:31:17] <kkuno> so that list.length ---> 0
[07:31:19] <WholemealLoaf> Err yeah ok
[07:31:29] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: http://webwordcount.com/count.php?u=rZCENk6w
[07:31:39] <MysterOnyx> timing, there was a play button that started both of them, but I took it out until i can debug this. All of that code is in the jscript so that it doesn't have to be in every html file I use. It can simply call a function instead.
[07:31:48] <Eviltwin> WholemealLoaf: http://jsperf.com/two-jquery-selections-vs-one-with-traversal/2
[07:32:05] <Eviltwin> kkuno: I believe list.length = 0 works
[07:32:17] <kkuno> mmmh I'll try, thanks Eviltwin
[07:32:29] <WholemealLoaf> Cool ta
[07:33:31] <Eviltwin> getElementById is wicked fast compared to everything else
[07:33:37] <WholemealLoaf> yeah seems so
[07:33:51] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, http://webwordcount.com/js/popup.js needs to be loaded before http://webwordcount.com/js/count.js
[07:33:54] * WholemealLoaf deletes all jquery traversal methods
[07:34:14] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: 2secs, I will give it a shot
[07:34:32] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, and put allof your js togather, preferrably before the </body> tag
[07:34:50] <astropirate> *right before
[07:36:12] <MysterOnyx> timing when I comment out the second player call in the html, the 1st sound plays in the first player
[07:36:33] <MysterOnyx> so the problem has something to do with the 2nd run through of initializing the jplayer
[07:36:43] <BinaryKitten> WholemealLoaf  you know if you just pass #X to jQuery, it passed through to getElementById nicely?
[07:37:03] <WholemealLoaf> sans quotes?
[07:37:09] <BinaryKitten> with quotes
[07:37:10] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: doesn't seem to trigger
[07:37:21] <kul> How can I get the number for each <li> element ?
[07:37:22] <Eviltwin> $("#foo") does document.getElementById("foo")
[07:37:29] <Eviltwin> kul: see ?.index
[07:37:29] <bot-t> kul, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:37:33] <BinaryKitten> exactly Eviltwin
[07:37:41] <WholemealLoaf> well yeah i knew that, same with qsa right?
[07:37:56] <BinaryKitten> nope not same with QSA
[07:38:08] <BinaryKitten> as qsa doesn't exist on all browsers
[07:38:15] <Eviltwin> Not every browser supports QSA and jQuery has lots of selectors that QSA doesn't support
[07:38:32] <WholemealLoaf> well no but I mean the native method is used where possible, falling back to jquery magic, same as getElementById
[07:38:43] <BinaryKitten> but the simpler you keep your selector, the easier things are
[07:38:47] <WholemealLoaf> yar
[07:38:48] <Eviltwin> Well it alwaysuses getElementById
[07:38:55] <Eviltwin> But getElementById is always fast
[07:38:59] <Eviltwin> It's basically one hash table
[07:39:04] <Eviltwin> QSA is another story
[07:39:18] <Eviltwin> It's still faster by a long shot than doing the traversal in JS
[07:39:23] <Eviltwin> But it's still not as fast
[07:39:35] <Eviltwin> as getElementById
[07:39:43] <BinaryKitten> but yes, WholemealLoaf if there is a browser based method that will get stuff fast in the same way then jQuery will use that
[07:40:00] <WholemealLoaf> yep, got it :)
[07:40:15] <BinaryKitten> :)
[07:40:18] <crewnecktech> can I make a .hover() work only on the opaque sections of a transparent png instead of the whole image area?
[07:40:50] <BinaryKitten> WholemealLoaf pop quiz  which is better $('div#a')
[07:40:58] <BinaryKitten> or $('#a')
[07:40:59] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, are you sure the else if is being called?
[07:41:18] <WholemealLoaf> I would guess its #a
[07:41:21] <BinaryKitten> also which is better $('div.a') or $('.a')
[07:41:33] <BinaryKitten> WholemealLoaf correct on num1
[07:41:39] <WholemealLoaf> div.a cos it uses getElementsByTagName?
[07:42:09] <BinaryKitten> the second is browser dependant
[07:42:17] <WholemealLoaf> figures
[07:42:40] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: yea, because everything else in there triggers apart from loadPopup() and centerPopup()
[07:42:40] <BinaryKitten> heh, sorry the 2nd was a trick question..
[07:42:47] <WholemealLoaf> Sure I read a post somewhere comparing all these cross-browser
[07:43:15] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: maybe the functions aren't 'global' enough?
[07:44:13] * BinaryKitten shudders at mention of the g word
[07:48:34] <MysterOnyx> cssSelectorAncestor: "#jp_container_"+$end <<<< am I doing this wrong?
[07:49:18] <astropirate> ethicalhack3r, i'm not sur whawts wrong, i'd have to sit and go through your whole code to figure out whats going on
[07:51:15] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: would you consider yourself an expert?
[07:51:25] <BinaryKitten> nope
[07:51:34] <BinaryKitten> just a informed user
[07:51:40] <BinaryKitten> *an informed user
[07:52:11] <Mkop> is there a one-line way to say "make this div look like a jquery-ui widget?"
[07:52:37] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: hmm.. damn I need a wiz to help me debug this
[07:52:53] <surfdue> so far two brave souls have tried.
[07:53:16] <DCameronMauch> question about javascript core - if I have some code currently executing when an event is triggered, does the current code and the event handler run simultaneously, or some the current code suspend until event handler completes?  so basically, is javascript multithreaded?
[07:53:29] <ethicalhack3r> astropirate: no problem, thanks for looking
[07:53:50] <pifantastic> DCameronMauch: nope, 1 thread
[07:54:12] <pifantastic> DCameronMauch: unless you utilize WebWorkers
[07:54:17] <DCameronMauch> so current code would have to be suspended until handler completes
[07:54:36] <pifantastic> DCameronMauch: unless the handler does something asynchronously
[07:54:44] <pifantastic> like an Ajax request
[07:54:47] <DCameronMauch> or handler would have to wait, but I assume event handlers take priority
[07:54:58] <DCameronMauch> event triggers are async, aren't they?
[07:55:15] <BinaryKitten> code is executed in order...
[07:55:22] <BinaryKitten> but events triger whenever
[07:55:22] <kzrdat> hi
[07:55:52] <kzrdat> I'm tring to chang a div class on a other div hover
[07:56:01] <surfdue> lol @ that
[07:56:32] <surfdue> javascript triggering in order is like determining the difference in fl. oz between two identical cinnabuns.
[07:56:39] <dirkpennings> can someone help me? I try to shift an array, but the first loop my black thumb isn't shifted at the right way, in the second loop it is.. http://jsfiddle.net/dirkpennings/kf3v8/
[07:57:00] <surfdue> one way to control it, make each line a setTimeout and raise the ms every line.
[07:57:00] <kzrdat> is it correct? $("div.addstep1").mouseover(function(){
[07:57:00] <kzrdat>     	$(infopop).removeClass().addClass("popstep1");
[07:57:00] <kzrdat>     }).mouseout(function(){
[07:57:00] <kzrdat>     	$(infopop).removeClass().addClass("poptheglock");		
[07:57:00] <kzrdat>     });
[07:57:03] <BinaryKitten> yep surfdue but a two script tags will load in order
[07:57:03] <surfdue> -.-
[07:57:11] <BinaryKitten> kzrdat DO NOT PAST TO CHANNEL!
[07:57:16] <surfdue> i just died.
[07:57:19] <kzrdat> sorry :S
[07:57:27] * surfdue keels
[07:57:42] <BinaryKitten> kzrdat removeClass ... which class?
[07:57:56] <BinaryKitten> and no
[07:58:02] <BinaryKitten> don't use mouseover...
[07:58:15] <BinaryKitten> every minute movement of the mouse will ad the class again
[07:58:36] <BinaryKitten> use mouseenter and mouseleave
[07:58:38] <kzrdat> ok
[08:00:36] <sphinxxx> does code after a GET ajax request fire before the success on the request?
[08:00:55] <BinaryKitten> sphinxxx yes
[08:01:11] <BinaryKitten> unless you have a massively lightning fast response time
[08:01:21] <BinaryKitten> at which case, most likely it will
[08:01:33] <dirkpennings> nvm, got it
[08:01:53] <BinaryKitten> ajax(callback); othercode();  othercode will run while ajax call is processing..
[08:02:02] <sphinxxx> so how can I best wait for the success to run the remaining code, i'd have to throw it in a function and call it in the success state?
[08:03:16] <yogurt_truck> sphinxxx: look at the docs for.get(), it accepts callback, one of which fires on success
[08:03:41] <ramontayag> i want to include the aloha script tag (http://aloha-editor.org/builds/development/latest/doc/guides/output/using_aloha.html) dynamically based on a certain condition. i know that $getScript can add a script, but how do I add a script tag with a data-aloha-plugins attribute?
[08:04:33] <JSM87> hi im looking for a good jquery slider that can scroll images up not accross
[08:06:23] <Eviltwin> ramontayag: $("<script>",{src:"...","data-aloha-plugins":"..."}).appendTo("head")
[08:07:22] <ramontayag> Eviltwin, I tried something like that and it works, but how do I have a callback that executes after the file has loaded?
[08:07:46] <Eviltwin> JSM87: http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/?#demo
[08:07:54] <Eviltwin> And hit "Vertical" on the right
[08:08:15] <kzrdat> I know it's a noob question but I reall don't have knowledge at all in Javascript or in Jquery but can I apply my code to a id? I only see examples with class in the Api
[08:08:27] <Eviltwin> ramontayag: I don't know if every browser supports it but I think you can do $("<script>",{...}).load(function(){...}).appendTo("head")
[08:08:55] <ramontayag> ah thanks Eviltwin, will try
[08:09:18] <Eviltwin> kzrdat: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#selectors
[08:09:36] <Eviltwin> It can understand all of those selectors
[08:09:47] <Eviltwin> Well
[08:10:01] <Eviltwin> Definitely all of these: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching
[08:10:07] <Eviltwin> Most of those other ones
[08:10:12] <Eviltwin> Actually, right here: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:10:49] <e-anima> hmm i got some problems understanding the basic preload concept. preview_link = $(this).attr('data-hover-preview'); preloaded_hover = $('<img/>').attr('src', preview_link);
[08:10:57] <Eviltwin> kzrdat: You should read through this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[08:11:07] <Eviltwin> kzrdat: Then read through this: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:11:08] <e-anima> i thought the second part adds an element in the memory, and so its avaliable
[08:11:38] <Eviltwin> e-anima: What?
[08:11:44] <sphinxxx> i can't figure out why the console.log is runnign twice here:  http://jsfiddle.net/yKXjA/
[08:11:53] <e-anima> i am basically trying toi preload an image
[08:12:33] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: It's actually not running at all there
[08:12:40] <Eviltwin> e-anima: Okay
[08:12:49] <kzrdat> thanks for your links Evil Eviltwin
[08:13:20] <sphinxxx> eviltwin, thats not the full code, on my page it logs twice
[08:13:31] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: Then you called it twice
[08:13:37] <Eviltwin> Add a breakpoint
[08:13:41] <Eviltwin> And look a the stack traces
[08:13:58] <Eviltwin> If you don't know how to do that, read through this: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:16:46] <kul> var listItems = $(" ul.banner_list li").size() <-- I m using this to know the size of li's in my ul but in that li's there are more ul and li's. But I dont want to count those li's I just want to count the parent li's how can I get that ?
[08:16:51] <sphinxxx> eviltwin, why did you say it wouldn't fire at all?
[08:19:51] <mathi> hi
[08:20:11] <mathi> I can't make a simple alert working on IE (tried with 6 and 7)
[08:20:12] <mathi> http://pastebin.com/Um9LZADq
[08:20:20] <kul> any1 ?
[08:20:21] <mathi> it works on chrome, firefox, safari, opera, ...
[08:20:51] <mathi> it's just $(document).ready(function() { alert('hello'); }
[08:20:57] <pifantastic> kul: try $(" ul.banner_list > li").length
[08:21:30] <Nomikos> mathi: are there any errors?
[08:21:36] <mathi> Nomikos, no
[08:21:46] <Columcille> mathi: does ie support script type="application/javascript" ?
[08:21:46] <mathi> IE6 doesn't display any error or warning
[08:21:53] <kul> thanks pifantastic
[08:21:55] <kul> :)
[08:21:58] <Nomikos> huh. trying..
[08:22:40] <mathi> Columcille, ooooo changing to text/javascript solves the problem for IE6
[08:22:47] <mathi> strange that in IE7 I still have no alert
[08:23:03] <Columcille> odd
[08:23:37] <Dave_Stein> where's the best latest version of selectmenu? for some reason in jq 1.7 using delegate/on is not working for selectmenuopen
[08:23:48] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: I'm saying that the purpose of jsFiddles is to make a WORKING demo of your problem and your demo isn't working
[08:23:56] <mazzachre> How long is stuff on jsfiddle saved??
[08:24:09] <sphinxxx> eh
[08:24:09] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: I've got some that are six months old
[08:24:13] <sphinxxx> nevermid i got it working
[08:24:47] <mathi> Columcille, it's an issue with the IE7 browser, everything is working now
[08:24:49] <mathi> thanks!!
[08:24:50] <Vaerros> hm, what's up with jqueryui calendar localization? it seems like I could combine all needed locale 'definitions' into a single js file and put a single defaulter at the end
[08:25:08] <Columcille> mathi: good deal.
[08:25:26] <Nomikos> mathi: what was it?
[08:25:26] <Eviltwin> Vaerros: I think they just wanted to keep it all as small as possible
[08:26:06] <mathi> Nomikos, had to change <script type="application/javascript"> by <script type="text/javascript">
[08:26:20] <Nomikos> mathi: also for IE7?
[08:26:26] <mathi> Nomikos, yes
[08:26:27] <Eviltwin> type="text/javascript" is correct
[08:26:36] <Eviltwin> It's the right MIME type for JavaScript
[08:26:38] <Nomikos> ok
[08:26:57] <pifantastic> just leave that shit off
[08:26:58] <pifantastic> <script>
[08:27:00] <ramontayag> Eviltwin, your suggestion seems to load the script but it doesn't execute the function in "load"
[08:27:00] <pifantastic> BOOM
[08:27:02] <Columcille> Eviltwin: There are a few accepted mime types, and some favor application/javascript these days, but older browsers won't recognize it
[08:27:02] <Nomikos> Yeah, sometimes they /do/ adhere to standards
[08:27:02] <mathi> what is application/javascript MIME type for ?
[08:27:03] <ramontayag> i tried ff and chrome
[08:29:31] <Nomikos> huh, TIL http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.html#sec-7.1
[08:30:51] <Eviltwin> ramontayag: Try .bind("load ready",function(){...})
[08:31:07] <BinaryKitten> .bind?
[08:33:19] <surfdue> Eviltwin: remember the site I showed you yesterday
[08:33:27] <surfdue> that is the one I am currently having problems with :(
[08:33:27] <ramontayag> Eviltwin, doesn't work either. this is my code. it's coffeescript. https://gist.github.com/1510910
[08:34:26] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Just ask your question
[08:34:26] <crewnecktech> can I make a .hover() work only on the opaque sections of a transparent png instead of the whole image area? googling for it is tough due to other transparency problems, thought maybe someone here would know!
[08:35:12] <Nomikos> hmm.. are image maps still html5-allowed?
[08:35:16] <surfdue> Eviltwin: you dont rememeber me from last night?
[08:35:24] <surfdue> not to mention the other plentiful days we have spoken?
[08:35:48] <pifantastic> crewnecktech: there is no "easy" way to do that, no
[08:35:57] <pifantastic> you're going to have to get clever
[08:36:04] <crewnecktech> Nomikos: not sure I've ever used an image map before..
[08:36:30] <Nomikos> crewnecktech: nah, I haven't seen 'm since the bad old days of html 3.2 :)
[08:36:58] <crewnecktech> pifantastic: thanks, for the answer, any ideas on cleverness for this particular concept?
[08:37:08] <Nomikos> but those at least gave you arbitrary clickable shapes on an image, not sure if hover would work with that, but..
[08:37:12] <crewnecktech> Nomikos: gotcha ;)
[08:38:03] <crewnecktech> I suppose I can cut it up into multiple images, it's MOSTLY blocky... :)
[08:38:26] <kul> I would like to append 2 div items in my html with text content as "1" and "2" if number of list-items are 2 who is that possible
[08:38:27] <kul> ?
[08:38:30] <Nomikos> crewnecktech: is this inspiring? http://www.workwithchoicecuts.com/demo/html-image-map-revisted/index.htm
[08:38:38] <Eviltwin> surfdue: I do remember you
[08:38:45] <surfdue> Eviltwin: gurd.
[08:38:55] <Eviltwin> But you keep hinting that you have a problem you need to solve before continuing
[08:38:57] <surfdue> Eviltwin: as you may rememeber the project is behing a login :P
[08:38:59] <Eviltwin> BUt not the actual problem :P
[08:39:11] <crewnecktech> Nomikos: ooo, that's what I want to do, I'll have to look at that source code
[08:39:52] <crewnecktech> Nomikos: thanks for the inspiration and pointers!
[08:40:07] <kul> *I mean how is it possible
[08:40:09] <Nomikos> crewnecktech: you're welcome :) I'm a little amazed that this made it through all the versions
[08:40:33] <Nomikos> Figured it'd have gone the way of frames and font tags
[08:40:51] <surfdue> Eviltwin: yes I do, remember how I am using ace.
[08:40:53] <crewnecktech> Nomikos: ha!!  his article on the topic mentions: "Back when Hamsterdance and Mahir Cagri were famous a HTML Image Map was a useful tool to web designers. "
[08:41:00] <Dave_Stein> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8606827/why-are-delagate-on-not-working-for-jquery-selectmenu :/
[08:41:17] <surfdue> Eviltwin: well somehow last night during my plentify mods to css i have caused the editor to become very buggy when switching tabs, resizing the browser, etc.
[08:41:17] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Yes and remember how I told you to just ask your question :P
[08:41:27] <Nomikos> crewnecktech: I KNEW IT!
[08:41:39] <surfdue> Eviltwin: so I need a third person to look at this and see what I am missing..
[08:41:50] <surfdue> i only modified html, frontend js, and css
[08:41:55] * Nomikos strokes his long, gray beard
[08:42:29] <Eviltwin> Well this sounds like you're looking for a needle in a haystack
[08:42:33] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ surfdue
[08:42:34] <bot-t> surfdue, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[08:42:44] <kul> I would like to append 2 div items in my html with text content as "1" and "2" if number of list-items are 2 who is that possible
[08:42:48] <Eviltwin> But from what I recall you were using git
[08:42:58] <Eviltwin> So you can bisect
[08:43:03] <surfdue> Eviltwin: you know I cant use jsfiddle. i would have to rewrite the entire site -.-
[08:43:13] <supsup> Eviltwin what does jdb stand for
[08:43:35] <Eviltwin> surfdue: You know that the point of a jsFiddle is not to put your whole website in it, right?
[08:43:40] <Eviltwin> It's to isolate the issue
[08:43:44] <Eviltwin> The specific issue
[08:44:22] <Eviltwin> supsup: "JavaScript Debug"
[08:44:32] <Eviltwin> supsup: Play on gdb
[08:44:36] <surfdue> Eviltwin: impossible.. i cant reproduce ace on jsfidover 30 js files
[08:45:06] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Then I'm sorry but you're going to have to use git bisect or something to isolate what was causing the problem
[08:45:12] <surfdue> but its chill iust try harder
[08:45:21] <Eviltwin> git bisect should make it easy
[08:45:45] <supsup> Eviltwin : thanks
[08:46:10] <Eviltwin> supsup: I added it after people came here and dumped a thousand lines of code in a jsFiddle and asked us why it wasn't working
[08:46:21] <supsup> ~~
[08:46:48] * crewnecktech wishes he had a long, gray beard
[08:47:48] * Nomikos wishes he had moved on from webdev about 10 years ago..
[08:48:07] <amitprakash> Hi, can my webpage at x.domain.com make a $.ajax request to y.domain.com ?
[08:48:15] <Eviltwin> amitprakash: No
[08:48:27] <Nomikos> jsonp?
[08:48:35] <amitprakash> Eviltwin: so SOP restricts to sub-domains, not just domains
[08:48:52] <kborchers> hey Dave_Stein you got a fiddle for that?
[08:48:59] <Eviltwin> amitprakash: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[08:49:02] * supsup wishes he was a baller
[08:49:57] <Nomikos> amitprakash: it's not trivial, but this might help https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[08:50:06] <Eviltwin> Although by manipulating document.domain, you can make a request to a superdomain I believe
[08:50:24] <amitprakash> Nomikos: will look into it , thanks
[08:50:29] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: not yet. my week is slamming me to hell so i just reverted and have to work on something else in the hopes of getting an answer to go back to 1.7
[08:50:40] <Dave_Stein> but like i asid in my post i cant remember where i got that copy of selectmenu
[08:50:42] <dp> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8595526/automatically-resizing-fancybox-with-an-iframe-for-content -- can anyone help with my question?
[08:50:42] <Dave_Stein> it was somewhere on git
[08:51:06] <Eviltwin> dp: Is it the same domain?
[08:51:15] <dp> Eviltwin: yes
[08:51:15] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/selectmenu/
[08:51:50] <Eviltwin> dp: Perhaps var h = $("iframe").contents().find("body").height();
[08:51:55] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: i dont think it was the one frm you guys. i think it was an interim between filmanet groups and yours
[08:51:56] <Eviltwin> Then $("iframe").height(h);
[08:51:58] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[08:52:04] <Eviltwin> $("iframe").css("height",h);
[08:52:04] <Dave_Stein> but i do know its still calling ._trigger which is ui's
[08:52:11] <Dave_Stein> so i dont know why delegate woudlnt pick it upt
[08:52:16] <meesebyte> I want jquery to pick a random image from a list of images for an image animation. Best way to do so?
[08:52:39] <Dave_Stein> random number which is key of array
[08:52:40] <dp> Eviltwin: the problem is that the height that's returned from that doesn't seem to actually match the height of the element
[08:52:59] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: var images = $("img"); var rand = images.eq(Math.floor(Math.random()*images.length));
[08:53:02] <meesebyte> Right now, the image is defined by "var $img = $('#mc')"
[08:53:04] <meesebyte> oh
[08:53:05] <meesebyte> k
[08:53:11] <muszek> hi... I wanna store options for my script in html5's data-*.  is there any ready solution for that or at least a good practice to follow?
[08:53:36] <dp> Eviltwin: once sec, and I'll show you
[08:53:42] <meesebyte> eviltwin: so "img" can be replaced with a class right?
[08:53:47] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Sure thing
[08:54:42] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: oohhh, you should switch to ours. i just tested that delegate against ours and it works fine
[08:55:12] <meesebyte> Thanks, eviltwin.
[08:55:15] <Dave_Stein> yeah i was planning on doing that real soon
[08:55:24] <Dave_Stein> i just was hoping for a fix for my current one
[08:55:40] <kborchers> there are still issues being worked out but getting close
[08:55:42] <Dave_Stein> a few of my apps will easily be able to switch to yours but my current one, i need more qa to do that
[08:55:44] <meesebyte> You have a lot of free time eviltwin? You are here all the time and help everyone out. Awesome, dude. :D
[08:56:01] <Dave_Stein> yeah we all hate the current selectmenu that isnt official ui
[08:56:02] <Dave_Stein> dying for yours
[08:56:03] <Dave_Stein> :)
[08:56:16] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: you got a link to the one giving you problems?
[08:57:08] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: let me just give you a link to the script on my site
[08:57:17] <dp> Eviltwin: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/841/selection20111222115417.png/ (1)  http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/215/selection20111222115523.png/ (2) and http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/805/selection20111222115534.png/ (3)
[08:57:19] <kborchers> ok
[08:57:54] <Dave_Stein> http://prosite.com/assets/js/jquery/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js it says to go to your docs but i didn't get it from there - i also made some mods to fix bugs myself like when it fired focus at the wrong time and made my browser jump scrollbar
[08:59:49] <Dave_Stein> i don't know why it would be the plugin itself if its calling ._trigger properly
[09:01:59] <Eviltwin> dp: Could it be due to margin/padding?
[09:02:29] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: i'm supposed to do some ui work this weekend, maybe i'll be able to help bang out some remaiining selectmenu bugs
[09:03:14] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: if u do, you may want to coordinate with felix cuz i know he is actively working on it
[09:03:42] <Dave_Stein> whats his IRC/twitter?
[09:04:09] <MysterOnyx> anyone good with jplayer
[09:04:12] <Dave_Stein> In the next week or so I'm revamping one of our sites pretty hard and we want to get a good selectmenu to replace the current crap so I can probably get time to work on UI while at work
[09:04:47] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: honestly not sure on those. i usually just contact him via the githubs
[09:05:05] <kborchers> check that branch. he is all over it
[09:05:09] <Dave_Stein> okay i'll find him later
[09:06:25] <Dave_Stein> so screw this plugin im using, im just gonna use 1.6 on prosite for now and bump up to 1.7 a lil later after selectmenu is set
[09:06:33] <Dave_Stein> back to work for me
[09:06:44] <NoiseEee> wondering if i'm missing something in jqueryui.... http://jsfiddle.net/cN3UM/2/ versus http://jsfiddle.net/cN3UM/3/ where the axis constraint along "x" completely changes where the helper is rendered?  I need the axis restricted, but not at the place its happening on
[09:06:46] <martndemus> Anyone here that knows how the source code of jquery works?
[09:07:02] <NoiseEee> martndemus: uhhhhhh....
[09:07:21] <martndemus> is that a yes?
[09:07:27] <NoiseEee> martndemus: its javascript.
[09:07:36] <NoiseEee> martndemus: what does your question even mean?
[09:07:44] <martndemus> no shit sherlock, but i mean how it internally works
[09:07:49] <supsup> lol
[09:08:55] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: hey, not sure without a working version of that selectmenu to test but it may be that the menu is appended to the body, so the event may not actually bubble to the form. try delegating to body to test
[09:12:39] <NoiseEee> anyone?
[09:13:16] <jubby> Hey everyone! Using "each" how can I check within the each to see if it's the first or last? https://gist.github.com/1511041
[09:14:04] <pifantastic> jubby: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[09:14:31] <pifantastic> the first argument to the callback you supply to each() is the index of the current item
[09:14:36] <martndemus> jubby, before the each, make a variable that contains the length of the 'array' and a counter variable
[09:14:42] <pifantastic> no dont do that
[09:15:40] <martndemus> (im propably too vanilla js)
[09:15:59] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: i had tried that earlier in firebug with no luck
[09:16:33] <LordThumper> jubby: Would this work $(".element").each(function() { if(this).first() { // code } })
[09:16:34] <pifantastic> martndemus: https://gist.github.com/1511056
[09:16:37] <pifantastic> oops
[09:16:40] <pifantastic> jubby: https://gist.github.com/1511056
[09:16:48] <sphinxxx> if i have an xml file, i can't put javascript code between <code> </code> without it throwing an xmlparseentity ref error?
[09:17:03] <pifantastic> jubby: or yes, look into first() and :first as LordThumper
[09:17:03] <rue> It needs to be CDATA?
[09:17:04] <pifantastic> said
[09:17:29] <NoiseEee> martndemus: http://simonwillison.net/2007/aug/15/jquery/ is a read along your question, albeit referencing an older version of jquery
[09:17:42] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: hmm, not sure then. sorry
[09:18:07] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: its all good.the more reasons i have to help out felix the better so it can get out faster for everyone :)
[09:18:12] <jubby> first() return the length of the "eaches" but the argument worked for me
[09:18:15] <martndemus> NoiseEee: let me take a look
[09:18:18] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: My ceo didnt look happy when i said id help out during work but whoops :D
[09:18:34] <jubby> pifantastic: Thank you friend.
[09:19:06] <martndemus> NoiseEee: that's how jQuery works from the outside :(
[09:19:26] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: tell 'em I said help us, help u. ;)
[09:19:34] <MysterOnyx> I have an object that's not initializing correctly. I know this because when I copy the same initialization code into a button function, and I click the button, the object initializes correctly. Can someone help me figure out why it's not initializing correctly on page load?
[09:19:51] <Dave_Stein> i told him we need a good selectmenu and it's either me helping youguys or me writing my own lol
[09:20:25] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: also, keep in ming official selecemenu i think is slated for 1.9 which is still a ways out. of course you can always use before but ...
[09:20:55] <NoiseEee> wondering if i'm missing something in jqueryui.... http://jsfiddle.net/cN3UM/2/ versus http://jsfiddle.net/cN3UM/3/ where the axis constraint along "x" completely changes where the helper is rendered?  I need the axis restricted, but not where its being rendered. afaik i'm doing everything like http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement , except for returning a custom helper.
[09:20:59] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: yeah i know
[09:21:13] <meesebyte> eviltwin: I don't really know where I would put the images that var rand would pick. here's what I had before that http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/ZCt5n/5/
[09:21:19] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: should work for 1.8 tho unless there was some huge overhaul on 1.9 which I don't think there was?
[09:21:39] <sphinxxx> why do fadeins/fadeouts / animations take longer in firefox to fire, than in chrome?
[09:21:56] <dp> ok. it seems that it's down to the fact that the dom isn't actually finished when jquery is firing $(document).ready(). if I put a setTimeout in to change the height of my element after 1 second, FF and Chrome both set it properly. IE is another beast altogether
[09:21:58] <richardjprice> by default, if i were to drop a draggable clone onto a droppable, would it stay or disappear?
[09:40:50] <nitzer> hey! i think i found an error while parsing xml
[09:43:25] <Rock[]> hi
[09:43:59] <Rock[]> I'm having an interesting issue with a functionality of jqueryui
[09:44:02] <nitzer> if you pass this xml : http://webservice.oca.com.ar/oep_tracking/Oep_Track.asmx/Tracking_Pieza?Pieza=3492200000000000003&CUIT=&NroDocumentoCliente= to jQuery, the $('xml').find('Table') just return empty dom's
[09:44:53] <Rock[]> using append(Node) does not trigger some magical stuff while append(text) does
[09:45:53] <Rock[]> using append(Node) first, than append(text) with what is the same html results in the Node part having its attributes changed however
[09:46:18] <Rock[]> so it seems like the *magical* attribute changing only happens when appending text in this case
[10:01:45] <grid_> hey
[10:03:23] <grid_> can someone help me here? http://fiddle.jshell.net/UWTLN/1/ really appreciated
[10:04:01] <grid_> i only look for a solution to have any parent function working in this jsfiddle
[10:04:26] <grid_> my programmer couldnt get it to work last night
[10:05:28] <Jon47> grid_ you paying?
[10:05:52] <grid_> Jon47: he is a friend
[10:06:00] <Jon47> hehe, ok
[10:06:05] <grid_> or do you mean to you?
[10:06:12] <zurdo13> hello I'm new to jquery I'm trying to hide a div in html when using a select tag does not work
[10:06:29] <zurdo13> http://pastebin.com/sGnxjjmD
[10:06:46] <grid_> Jon47: i want to use the show/hide function from the popup
[10:08:28] <nitzer> zurdo13: that's never going to work
[10:08:50] <nitzer> zurdo13: you should bind the event change of the select to do the switch you want
[10:10:31] <zurdo13> bind
[10:10:33] <zurdo13> ?
[10:12:24] <h4ruh1> grid_: try loading jQuery on http://jsfiddle.net/UWTLN/show/, it onloads MooTools.. and second, try using live('click', function() { ... }) instead of click(functin() {..})
[10:12:59] <velts_> or is using the new jquery you can .on
[10:13:08] <nitzer> zurdo13: http://pastebin.com/BbYE06a2
[10:13:18] <h4ruh1> he's using 1.8 :/
[10:13:22] <nitzer> or using live()
[10:13:42] <nitzer> $(elem).live('event',function(){console.log('wololo')})
[10:14:41] <velts_> nitzer: if he is using jquer 1.7 or above .live is deprecated
[10:14:44] <h4ruh1> *I mean 1.6
[10:14:45] <nitzer> bind(live|on) is like capturing the event and executing something when that event occurs
[10:14:53] <nitzer> live isn't newer than on and bind?
[10:14:59] <velts_> ohh
[10:15:25] <nitzer> i think that live is 1.8+
[10:15:30] <velts_> no live is deprecated in 1.7 and above
[10:15:31] <ajpiano> ?!?!!?!?!
[10:15:35] <h4ruh1> 1.7+ is on()
[10:15:43] <velts_> h4ruh1: correct
[10:15:49] <meesebyte> Eviltwin: for "var images = $("img"); var rand = images.eq(Math.floor(Math.random()*images.length));" How do I even implement it or give images to it?
[10:15:54] <h4ruh1> 1.7 below is live, delegate or bind
[10:15:55] <djQuery> grid_: also there is no dom element called parent so your selector will never return anything
[10:16:03] <velts_> yah or .live
[10:16:05] <meesebyte> do I just have to hide the images in the page?
[10:16:30] <nitzer> yep , thats right , my memory failed ;p on is newer than live
[10:17:08] <meesebyte> oh, I think I've got it
[10:17:15] <meesebyte> just have to list the images...
[10:19:02] <grid_> h4ruh1: it is actually http://jsfiddle.net/UWTLN/1/ but can you give an example?
[10:21:22] <martndemus> Anyone here that has a good knowledge how jQuery internally works? I've got some questions about the jQuery constructor function
[10:21:33] <grid_> djQuery: can you be more specific?
[10:22:31] <martndemus> specifically how jQuery makes it's psuedo array
[10:22:39] <martndemus> of DOM elements
[10:23:15] <grid_> djQuery: is it possible what i want?
[10:24:00] <martndemus> i'm trying, as a hobby project, to recreate a jQuery ish library with subset of jQuery functions,
[10:24:31] <djQuery> grid_: dunno been bouncing back and forth trying to learn node and 10 other things at once. the example you most recently linked to is nothing like what I was looking at before and I missed the origian Q
[10:25:00] <h4ruh1> grid_: Your iframe's src, http://jsfiddle.net/UWTLN/ contains $(document).ready() but doesn't onLoad jQuery
[10:26:13] <djQuery> grid_: ok here it is $("parent.show_hide").show();
[10:26:44] <JAAulde> `.data()` with no params returns a map of all data.  Is there any simialr thing available for getting back a map of all attributes?  `.attr()` does not provide such a thing.
[10:26:47] <joshsmith> if I'm using a custom template (in a script type="text/template"), how can I access the id of the div within that template with jQuery?
[10:26:47] <djQuery> so from the iframe you are trying to get a hold of the parent?
[10:27:03] <grid_> djQuery: yes
[10:27:10] <joshsmith> I'm trying to do something like what Backbone does in its views render method, but just on my own
[10:27:16] <h4ruh1> grid_: It onLoads MooTools instead, another thing.. $('parent.show_hide') does not exist.
[10:27:20] <grid_> h4ruh1: yes, i see there is no jquery libary inside the iframe
[10:27:57] <shadyhax> .join #html
[10:27:57] <socialhapy> shadyhax: Sorry, admins only
[10:28:03] <grid_> so with the jquery libary inside the iframe it would be $("parent.show_hide").show(); ?
[10:28:34] <shadyhax> what is a good website where i can search for jobs in my area?
[10:29:33] <djQuery> $('.showhide', parent.document).hide();
[10:29:40] <djQuery> grid_: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[10:29:55] <grid_> hehe
[10:30:00] <JAAulde> Is there any way, native to jQ, to get a map of all attrs on an element?
[10:30:05] <djQuery> in the iframe you need to put the selector in the context of the parent item
[10:30:13] <andrew9183> damn i need a function like dothisifie7()
[10:30:33] <djQuery> ?browser
[10:30:33] <bot-t> jQuery.browser: Contains flags for the useragent, read from navigator.userAgent. We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser may be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[10:31:00] <djQuery> andrew9183: although feature detection would be much better
[10:31:07] <JAAulde> ^^ yes
[10:31:09] <djQuery> andrew9
[10:31:38] <Nomikos> Does anyone know if it's possible to grab .sortable() settings from the .sortable element somehow? I'm trying for example axis: $(this).data('axis'), but little luck so far..
[10:31:46] <andrew9183> have you used modernizr ?
[10:32:01] <djQuery> andrew9183: and I blelive $.browser is going to \has been depreciated
[10:32:03] <ajpiano> Nomikos: you can use $(this).sortable("option", "axis")
[10:32:12] <Nomikos> In .sortable()'s start & stop functions I /can/ use $(this)
[10:32:29] <andrew9183> ah
[10:32:46] <ajpiano> JAAulde: you might want to look at Element.attributes
[10:33:03] <andrew9183> hi ajpiano
[10:33:06] <Nomikos> ajpiano: hmm.. I wanted to avoid using seperate lines, since there might be more sortable lists on one page with different settings
[10:33:29] <ajpiano> Nomikos: i think you can get the entire options object out of the instance, 1 sec
[10:33:53] <JAAulde> ajpiano: sure, will do.  Just wondered if there was anything in the jQ API for consistency in my code.  Thanks
[10:34:45] <ajpiano> Nomikos: $("#yourSortableElement").data("sortable").options will give you the whole object
[10:35:46] <grid_> h4ruh1: i now have it like http://jsfiddle.net/vgtUZ/1/
[10:35:56] <Nomikos> ajpiano: ok; I was trying to have basic settings for any sortable element, and add specifics via data(), but #id works as well I guess
[10:36:12] <ajpiano> whaaaat
[10:36:19] <ajpiano> that's not at all what i'ms saying you have to do
[10:36:32] <ajpiano> Nomikos: are you saying you want to set some defaults for *all sortables* beforehand
[10:36:37] <Nomikos> ok, misunderstanding :-)
[10:36:49] <martndemus> ajpiano: can you help me explain how a part of the jQuery constructor works? The part is where 'this.context = this[0] = selector' ends up being a psuedo array, i think i understand what it does there, but if i try to recreate it, it doesnt really work, so i must be missing a step.
[10:36:54] <ajpiano> Nomikos: a) there's an entire API for getting and setting option values in jquery ui
[10:37:23] <Nomikos> ajpiano: yeah, sorta - I have the external script file with the handler for it, which talks ajax, and which is used for several sortable lists
[10:37:30] <ajpiano> Nomikos: b) if you want to have some shared defaults, just create them at the top of your page and then extend those when initing all your different sortables
[10:37:31] <grid_> h4ruh1: what do you think about it?
[10:37:58] <ajpiano> var defaults = { axis: "y"}   $(".something").sortable( $.extend({handle: ".wat", defaults})
[10:38:10] <Nomikos> ajpiano: and was hoping I could put some small values (axis, distance) in the tags
[10:38:34] <ajpiano> martndemus: i can never remember how that part works exactly,
[10:38:45] <martndemus> ajpiano: shit D=
[10:38:45] <ajpiano> Nomikos: you can do that, just read them out before you setup the sortable
[10:39:26] <Nomikos> ajpiano: hmkay, I'll rewrite it a little
[10:39:38] <ajpiano> martndemus: are you asking how, at that point, 'this' is already array-like
[10:39:56] <djQuery> grid_: http://jsfiddle.net/vgtUZ/4/
[10:39:56] <ajpiano> Nomikos: you also may be vaguely interested in see ?g damian edwards unobtrusive jquery ui
[10:39:58] <bot-t> Nomikos, jQuery.ui.unobtrusively - NuGet Gallery - http://nuget.org/packages/jquery.ui.unobtrusively
[10:40:05] <ajpiano> that's not it
[10:40:11] <ajpiano> oh wait, yes it is :p
[10:40:11] <djQuery> please look at both pages referenced int eh first page
[10:40:40] <Nomikos> bookmarked for when I am more awake :-)
[10:41:09] <Eviltwin> Wait {handle: ".wat", defaults} ?
[10:41:23] <Eviltwin> $.extend({handle: ".wat", defaults})
[10:41:30] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't that be $.extend({handle: ".wat"}, defaults)
[10:41:48] <grid_> djQuery: it will not load the function from the popup, does it?
[10:41:52] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: typos, they happen :)
[10:42:06] <MysterOnyx> is it possible in jquery to search the html file's directory for files of a certain type and then load each file name into an array? Or is this best suited for javascript?
[10:42:30] <ajpiano> martndemus: if you post on the forum in developing jquery i will try to noodge someone to give you a good answer
[10:42:45] <martndemus> ajpiano: will do
[10:43:55] <Nomikos> MysterOnyx: that's best done by a serverside script, methinks
[10:44:02] <Eviltwin> martndemus: this.context = this[0] = selector is the same as this[0] = selector; this.context = selector
[10:44:26] <MysterOnyx> Nomikos ok
[10:45:11] <martndemus> Eviltwin: that i understand, i think ill go and explain my whole problem in detail on the jquery forum right now
[10:45:22] <ajpiano> martndemus: jQuery.merge is where the .length of the collection is manually mantained
[10:46:11] <grid_> djQuery: hmm :)
[10:51:43] <monk12> Hey Eviltwin, I took to analyzing the code I saw on stackoverflow yesterday (that tries to explain how jquery works by posting a simpler example)... Posted my step by step logic flow here... but the main part stumps me for now: http://jsfiddle.net/qXFzc/11/ Wasnt sure if anyone can fill in the gap on what the code is acheiving.
[10:51:49] <grid_> djQuery: what will be different with this http://jsfiddle.net/vgtUZ/4/ in order to get it to work?
[10:52:33] <monk12> (code just creates a plugin similar to jquery that makes a alert box)
[10:54:01] <djQuery> grid_: sorry dude gotta run
[10:54:31] <djQuery> grid_: there is plenty of stuff on the intertubes about calling the parent page from an iframe
[10:54:38] <andrew9183> grid: what are you trying to achieve ?
[10:54:57] <grid_> ok man see you, yeah, i tried that with my friend, but he couldnt get it to work
[10:55:20] <grid_> andrew9183: i want to call the function in the parent from the iframe
[10:55:35] <grid_> Show/hide
[10:58:05] <djQuery> grid_: if the funciton is actualy defined in the parent then you can just call parent.functionname
[10:59:46] <Eviltwin> monk12: I believe this is a little closer to what happens: http://jsfiddle.net/qXFzc/12/
[11:00:31] <monk12> oh my, ok let me analyze that and come back with some questions.
[11:00:43] <monk12> thanks!
[11:00:52] <grid_> djQuery: you would make me happy if you could make any simple example so we can build our page on that working example
[11:01:41] <grid_> it works usually that way, but i want to make it to work with the popup right now, seems to be a little bit more complicated
[11:04:38] <monk12> Eviltwin, maybe silly question... but when calling "new foo.fn.init(arg)"  .... Does it basically do this "new foo()  .fn   .init(arg)" or "new ( foo.fn.init(arg) )" [init returns this, and creates new instance of this].
[11:04:42] <monk12> Not sure whats going on there.
[11:05:07] <Eviltwin> More like the latter
[11:05:22] <Eviltwin> foo.fn.init is the thing being instantiated
[11:05:54] <andrew9183> hey Eviltwin
[11:07:37] <monk12> Eviltwin,  Why is the constructor property explicitly mentioned? [i think i read about some bug that occurs if you dont explicitly set the constructor, wasnt sure if thats why you put it]
[11:09:21] <grid_> h4ruh1: can you help?
[11:09:29] <Eviltwin> I believe that's to facilitate copying of the object
[11:09:39] <Eviltwin> By being able to access the constructor
[11:09:53] <martndemus> ajpiano, Eviltwin: my problem explained -> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-constructor-internals
[11:10:17] <Eviltwin> martndemus: That's empty for me
[11:10:37] <martndemus> ah, its  "Awaiting moderation!"
[11:11:27] <ajpiano> not anymore :)
[11:12:41] <martndemus> thanks
[11:13:11] <Eviltwin> martndemus: Now as soon as you've wired the money, I'll take a look :P
[11:13:18] <surfdue> hola
[11:13:41] <martndemus> Eviltwin: http://img1.etsystatic.com/il_fullxfull.192652309.jpg
[11:13:55] <surfdue> Eviltwin: how much
[11:13:59] <surfdue> digital money is easy
[11:14:30] <Eviltwin> Actually I think I have a pledgie going after the fifth-or-so "I owe you a beer"
[11:14:50] <Eviltwin> Here it is: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[11:15:13] <surfdue> id plegde if u fixed this bug
[11:16:34] <martndemus> Eviltwin: Ill do it, if you can help me with my problem
[11:17:24] <freeed> Hey guys.. anyone know if I can somehow pull a google hosted version of jquery ui with only a few items.. like just core, mouse, widget, and draggable?
[11:17:35] <surfdue> I WAS FIRST
[11:17:38] * surfdue shoves martndemus
[11:17:41] <surfdue> lol
[11:17:42] <freeed> As opposed to just calling https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js
[11:18:07] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Wasn't your issue not much more specific than "something broke. can you fix it?"
[11:19:13] <surfdue> Eviltwin: no i have an exact bug that is easy to reproduece
[11:19:16] <surfdue> reproduce
[11:19:26] <Eviltwin> Easy to reproduce in a dozen lines?
[11:19:39] <surfdue> no easy to reproduce on my site with chrome or firebug
[11:20:14] <poppiez> I've created this autocomplete plugin for input fields. on blur I have the list. I want to apply a click handler on each item in the list. when I click the list, the blur event triggers, hiding the list before the click occurs. how can I prevent this?
[11:20:21] <poppiez> on blur I hide the*
[11:20:39] <Eviltwin> surfdue: So you're saying that given the thousands of lines of code you have in play there, you can easily reproduce the bug
[11:20:59] <surfdue> yes but the bug is only reproducable with the exact order of all the lines of code
[11:21:20] <surfdue> and then once its reproduced its easy to see it, I just don't have the necessary skils to look at the reproduced results and say oh.. X = 1
[11:22:44] <Eviltwin> The problem is that unless you can trim the code down substantially, that means it could be any of those thousands of lines causing the problem
[11:22:59] <Eviltwin> And it's tempting to say "Well it's obviously from this section or file"
[11:23:14] <Eviltwin> But if it were, you should be able to separate that out and still reproduce it
[11:23:50] <Eviltwin> Have you gone through this? http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[11:23:59] <Eviltwin> Do you know how to debug with breakpoints and stack traces?
[11:25:43] <Eviltwin> What I keep trying to explain is that I don't have familiarity with your codebase
[11:25:53] <Eviltwin> And to get familiar would require a lot of time on my part
[11:25:55] <surfdue> Eviltwin: yes its not even having to do with debugging
[11:26:03] <surfdue> its just the way one or two css classes are acting with Ace
[11:26:09] <surfdue> i just cant target which ones
[11:26:11] <Eviltwin> How is it not having to do with debugging?
[11:26:53] <surfdue> Eviltwin: its both more complex and moresimple then you think
[11:27:01] <Eviltwin> Read right here: http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/elements-styles.html
[11:27:26] <surfdue> Eviltwin: so you willing to take a look? if its an easy fix ill def throw you a few coffees
[11:27:28] <surfdue> starbucks ones. ::p
[11:27:40] <Eviltwin> I'll take a look but no promises
[11:28:09] <xrated> http://xkcd.com/979/
[11:28:19] <Eviltwin> xrated: Yes
[11:28:28] <xrated> I feel the need to share this.
[11:28:32] <xrated> felt*
[11:28:49] <Eviltwin> It's worse when they reply saying "Nevermind, I fixed it."
[11:28:53] <Eviltwin> But nothing else
[11:29:12] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Give me the step-by-step to reproduce
[11:29:14] <xrated> That's really really frustrating >.>
[11:30:38] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way (some setting, etc) to tell jquery to warn me when I call a function on a selector that has no matches (ie no such element)?
[11:30:55] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Not exactly, no
[11:31:30] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, any way it can trigger an exception, yell at me, etc instead of silently ignoring it?
[11:31:37] <Eviltwin> But you could probably do something like $.fn.check = function() { if(this.length == 0) console.warn("Empty jQuery Collection! Selector: "+this.selector) };
[11:31:48] <sphinxxx> is it unwise to have an "about" section on the same page  (in a toggled div), or should it get its own page
[11:31:49] <Eviltwin> And then periodically call .check()
[11:31:53] <Eviltwin> Oh, and return this at the end
[11:32:17] <Eviltwin> Alternatively you can do what I did in one case and overload $ to check the return type
[11:32:30] <Eviltwin> But that only works for $() not results from like .parent() or anything like that
[11:34:32] <surfdue> Eviltwin: sure, pm?
[11:34:41] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Yeah, that's fine
[11:35:35] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Actually, you might want to overload pushStack
[11:37:07] <aarobc_work> So Is there  a way to tell if a div has finished loading if I'm loading it via ajax?
[11:37:19] <Misiur> Hi there, I'd like to know if I have something like $('.element').something({ a: __HERE__ }); - what should I place to get $('.element') ?
[11:38:08] <Eviltwin> Misiur: There's nothing you can place. You'd have to do var x = $(".element"); x.something({ a: x });
[11:38:39] <Misiur> Eviltwin: Ok, thanks
[11:39:24] <grid_> Eviltwin: i see you are talking about parent, can you help me with http://jsfiddle.net/vgtUZ/4/ i want to open the function in the parent from the iframe in the popup
[11:40:34] <chovy> how do i get the first item given var itms = $(".foo");
[11:40:45] <chovy> items.get(0).width() doesn't work.
[11:40:53] <chovy> i need to get the width of the first item.
[11:41:16] <Eviltwin> chovy: .eq
[11:41:56] <aarobc_work> Is it just not possible?
[11:44:34] <webPragmatist> how can i selectâ€¦ perform this on li > a ONLY if li only contains an a?
[11:44:46] <webPragmatist> right now i have $("#internal_menu_ul > .top > a")
[11:45:48] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: Can you explain a little further?
[11:46:05] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work: As soon as you do .html or .append or whatever, the elements are there
[11:46:16] <Eviltwin> If you're using .load, I'm pretty sure there's a callback
[11:46:43] <aarobc_work> Eviltwin: could you elaborate? I've looked through the documentation but nothing seems to work.
[11:46:53] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: something like this i suppose but maybe using just the selector engine
[11:46:54] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jqddswt6usfjvzjsoswzwg
[11:47:31] <webPragmatist> btw that doesn't work
[11:48:23] <Eviltwin> aarobc_work: Actually could you? Could you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[11:48:44] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: What's the selector supposed to do? Can you try explaining that a little further
[11:49:35] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: basically if the <li> only contains an <a> then go nuts and continue doing whatever is supposed to happen in the browser naturallyâ€¦ otherwise don't
[11:49:41] <webPragmatist> (do anything)
[11:50:35] <webPragmatist> li being .top
[11:51:16] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: just something quick to prevent the browser from going anywhere if there is a subnavigation mention
[11:53:18] <Rock[]> can anyone explain to me why the following line would return 0?
[11:53:20] <Rock[]> $('#my-id').ready(function () { alert ($('#my-id').length); });
[11:53:30] <Rock[]> it shouldn't, ever, right?
[11:53:32] <webPragmatist> pass $ into function($) ?
[11:54:14] <webPragmatist> that's my guessâ€¦ but i'm not going to pretend to understand scope in js heh
[11:54:26] <Rock[]> like: $('#my-id').ready(function ($) { alert ($('#my-id').length); }); ?
[11:54:42] <Rock[]> quick reply, but not yet
[11:54:47] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: actually this is stupid of me â€¦ of course that length is going to be >0
[11:54:53] <webPragmatist> needs to be like $(this)
[11:55:37] <Rock[]> wait, are you responding to me?
[11:56:21] <Nomikos> ajpiano: so, am I mad? :-) http://pastebin.com/jJh9qHLx
[11:56:45] <mattalexx> How can I find a select option by its contents? Is there a selector for that?
[11:57:00] <mattalexx> ... by the text inside, I mean
[11:57:05] <ajpiano> Nomikos: you can set all the options at once, and you could do it on init :)
[11:57:15] <sokie> ther ready() method is for the DOM, use load() on specific items
[11:57:32] <Nomikos> ajpiano: I'm not sure I understand, isn't this on init?
[11:57:40] <ajpiano> "in a sense"
[11:57:47] <jeffsmykil> this is a css question but you guys are more helpful... http://jsfiddle.net/65HaZ/2/  in IE 8 the left corner doesnt show
[11:57:51] <ajpiano> i'm saying you could have the options fetched before you call sortable
[11:57:51] <beepbeep_> Rock[]: I've never seen ready used like that
[11:57:54] <jeffsmykil> any idea why>
[11:57:57] <Nomikos> ajpiano: the first part is what I always had, I just added the each() loop
[11:58:09] <ajpiano> gimme a min Nomikos
[11:58:12] <sokie> ther ready() method is for the DOM, use load() on specific items @Rock[]
[11:58:13] <Nomikos> sure
[12:00:07] <Rock[]> using $(document).ready(..) results in the same problem though
[12:00:12] <Rock[]> always returning 0
[12:01:47] <ajpiano> Nomikos: http://pastebin.com/RwUgfebQ
[12:02:35] <SkyFlyer> I have a page that I load and i'm trying to get a large json response from another server.  It's a few seconds back as I need that object to load all the data on the page.  I do a ton of object manipulation on the response.. I can set it to a variable if I set async to false... but I still want the page to load and everything else to load and not have my script stop it all? async... what's best way to do this?
[12:06:54] <Mech0z> is .net 4.5 the version for win8 ?
[12:07:27] <Nomikos> ajpiano: I /think/ I get it mostly.. but I don't get what's happening with "config = " on the 3rd line - that is usually where the context of a selector would sit, right?
[12:07:27] <NoiseEee> SkyFlyer: best way to do what?
[12:07:43] <ajpiano> what
[12:07:49] <ajpiano> Nomikos: omggg
[12:07:52] <ajpiano> typ0o
[12:08:02] <ajpiano> missing paren
[12:08:19] <ajpiano> http://pastebin.com/xzdsMdsE
[12:08:21] <Nomikos> ah ok, so config is just another global var
[12:08:33] <Nomikos> I thought I was missing something :)
[12:09:13] <Nomikos> I'll have to look into extend, never used that
[12:09:47] <SkyFlyer> i'm just having issues understanding some of the scoping with ajax and callbacks.  trying to read more on it.  It looks like now I can allow my script to only run if the response back from the call is success, else run function failure();
[12:10:01] <ajpiano> Nomikos: it doesn't have to be global, i'm just illustrating a pattern
[12:10:10] <Nomikos> ajpiano: of course, right
[12:10:38] <shesek> Nomikos, config is actually created in the scope its declared in, the `var` in the previous line applies to it too
[12:11:10] <TheoMurpse> Suppose I have an anchor tag with parameters included in the URL (url.html?p1=a&p2=b). I want to change the request to be made as a POST request. What is the easiest way to do this with jquery?
[12:11:11] <shesek> you should put all that in a function to create a scope, rather than having it create global variables (as it would if it were top-level code)
[12:11:14] <Nomikos> yeah, I didn't mean global as in bad global, just as in 'next to sortables'
[12:11:44] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/65HaZ/3/
[12:11:48] <shesek> you should probably wrap it in $(function() { .... }), or an IIFE - (function() { .... })()
[12:12:13] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: #css
[12:12:30] <shesek> ajpiano, it is kinda weird to put that `update` function in a `config`  object, tho
[12:12:33] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: you ever been in there?
[12:12:34] <jeffsmykil> lol
[12:12:40] <ajpiano> shesek: no it isn't
[12:12:54] <Nomikos> shesek: nah, I do use the same update function for each of the 3 lists on this page
[12:13:17] <poppiez> I have a string "Apples are red" and some user input in a variable. let's say this variable contains "App". how do I match this in my initial string and wrap it in <span></span>?
[12:13:18] <shesek> how is a function considered configuration?
[12:14:11] <Nomikos> Configuration is telling a program how to behave, right? This tells it to trigger ajax if update happens
[12:14:22] <shesek> poppiez, well, the way that should've worked is 'Apples are red'.replace(user_input, '<span>' + user_input + '</span>', 'g')
[12:15:00] <shesek> but since the 3rd argument for replace doesn't work on all browsers, you're gonna have to create a regex using new RegEx (make sure to escape the user input and add the `i` flag)
[12:15:14] <shesek> Nomikos, no, configuration is configuring the program
[12:15:29] <shesek> 'telling a program how to behave' is a much more general description
[12:15:38] <shesek> you can apply it to every piece of code, really
[12:15:42] <ajpiano> shesek: are you *really* trying to insist that it *doesn't* make sense to have a reusable callback inside of some default configuration optoins
[12:15:57] <ajpiano> shesek: it's a config option for his particular setup, he could name the variable anything he wants
[12:16:21] <poppiez> shesek: isn't there a way to actually insert what the pattern returns as matching instead of the variable? something like using $1
[12:16:26] <shesek> ajpiano, sure he can... but it seems odd. If I were to skim a long code looking for a function, and see a `config` object, I would skip right thru it
[12:16:38] <shesek> poppiez, yes, \1
[12:16:47] <ajpiano> that says more  about you than it says about the pattern
[12:17:23] <sphinxxx> how can i stop an animation from happening when the user starts scrolling?
[12:17:32] <ChuckWorries> how to fix black flashes on IE6 during animation on transparent png's?
[12:17:36] <shesek> he can also name the variable 'kologomolo', its just doesn't say anything about what that variable contains
[12:17:50] <sphinxxx> chuckworries, stop using IE6 :)
[12:18:05] <ajpiano> shesek: so if he called it "options", now it magically makes sense?
[12:18:05] <shesek> variable names should be meaningful - `options` would be a better name than `config` in this case, IMHO
[12:18:09] <ChuckWorries> i have no choice my school loves IE
[12:18:26] <sphinxxx> unless you're in china, there's no reason to support ie6
[12:18:31] <poppiez> shesek: hmm, that doesn't seem to work. it returns
[12:18:39] <ajpiano> shesek: consider the hair split
[12:18:44] <poppiez> shesek: I can't even output the char here, it's some sort of unicode char
[12:18:45] <shesek> ajpiano, well, not magically - it makes sense because that variable now has a meaningful name, but yes
[12:18:48] <ChuckWorries> it also appears on IE8
[12:18:50] * Nomikos sticks to his nameless code for now :-)
[12:18:55] <ChuckWorries> forget IE6 lololol
[12:19:15] <shesek> ajpiano, I'm sorry, "hair split"?
[12:19:21] <shesek> not sure what that means
[12:19:43] <ajpiano> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hair-splitting
[12:20:09] <sphinxxx> ajpiano, what's the best way to test the efficiency of your site's js? (like an actual mathmetical way )
[12:20:30] <ajpiano> the profiling tools ?
[12:20:36] <ajpiano> in chrome dev tools, etc?
[12:20:36] <ChuckWorries> anyone?
[12:21:06] <shesek> I think that having meaningful variable names contributes a lot to code readability and maintainability, which are both important factors for me when I program
[12:21:14] <mattalexx> sphinxxx, You might like http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/
[12:22:01] <sphinxxx> ajpiano, i like the profiling tools for debugging a certain issue, but im looking for something of a "score" of my js
[12:31:30] <denbuzze> Hey all, on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7850 I saw that the sortable plug-in is being rewritten from scratch. Does anyone know what the ETA on this is?
[12:33:06] <Eviltwin> denbuzze: Sounds like a question for #jqueryui-dev
[12:33:21] <denbuzze> Eviltwin: Thanks
[12:34:00] <xckpd7> question: let's say I want to pull a data attribute and grab a class based on it
[12:34:18] <xckpd7> is the best way just to concatenate a period at the end or is there a more elegant way
[12:34:27] <xckpd7> I mean at the beginning, whoops
[12:34:30] <Eviltwin> I think that's the best / only good way
[12:34:57] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: thanks I'll go for that then
[12:34:57] <Eviltwin> If it gets fed to QSA it needs to be in that form
[12:35:06] <xckpd7> QSA....
[12:35:31] <xckpd7> oh k got ya
[12:35:51] <Eviltwin> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kn5_uxTVAkcJ:https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll
[12:39:14] <sphinxxx> anyway to prevent the weird screen spaz that happens if you try to scroll during a jquery scrolling animation?
[12:39:51] <Eviltwin> Not that I'm aware of
[12:40:09] <Eviltwin> Throw a fixed opacity: 0 div over the whole page so the user doesn't actually scroll?
[12:40:20] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you have any CSS chops?
[12:40:37] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Not really
[12:40:40] <Eviltwin> The people in #css do
[12:40:41] <sphinxxx> jeffsmykil, what you need
[12:40:52] <RobSpectre> I'm hiding some DOM elements with a slideUp - is there a way to refresh the page size without just refreshing the whole page?
[12:41:49] <Eviltwin> RobSpectre: If you want to refresh the page, refresh the page. If you want to do something else, do something else
[12:41:59] <jeffsmykil> sphinxxx: http://jsfiddle.net/65HaZ/3/
[12:42:14] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: Protip.
[12:43:01] <Eviltwin> I'm honestly not sure how those two things are connected other than by a "-"
[12:43:25] <Zogot> Evening all
[12:43:38] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: Issue is that when I slideUp those elements, the interface pulls up with it, but does not fill the browser window.
[12:43:55] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: Leaving a blank spot in the browser window the size of the elements I'm hiding.
[12:44:05] <Eviltwin> Correct
[12:44:10] <Eviltwin> That's becahse the height of the element changes
[12:44:32] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: Yup - so your recommendation is to expand those small elements to fill the size of the elements I'm hiding?
[12:44:48] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: Or is there an easier way to make those elements fill the available space without a page refresh?
[12:45:15] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by page refresh?
[12:45:27] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure how that's supposed to fix the problem
[12:45:35] <jeffsmykil> sphinxxx: any semblance of help  would be greatly appreciated
[12:45:42] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: location.reload()
[12:45:53] <Eviltwin> RobSpectre: And how exactly does that help you?
[12:46:01] <sphinxxx> jeffsmykil, im on a mac so can't test the ie8 issue, but try using normalize.css
[12:46:06] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: The empty space gets filled.
[12:46:10] <sphinxxx> from the html5 boilerplate
[12:46:12] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding the slideUp -> reload connection
[12:46:16] <Eviltwin> At all
[12:46:24] <RobSpectre> Eviltwin: kk - thanks for your help.
[12:46:33] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ RobSpectre
[12:46:33] <bot-t> RobSpectre, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:47:12] <jeffsmykil> sphinxxx: more than I got in CSS thanks
[12:48:49] <jeffsmykil> sphinxxx: unfortunately no dice
[12:49:26] <sphinxxx> hm, maybe a margin issue?
[12:49:40] <jeffsmykil> that;s the problem with these things
[12:49:42] <jeffsmykil> it could be anything
[12:49:50] <jeffsmykil> and works fine in ie7 and ie9
[12:52:19] <gorhgorh> hi there
[12:52:43] <pifantastic> hi
[12:53:04] <ChuckWorries> how to fix black flashes on IE8 during animation on transparent png's?
[12:53:44] <Brodingo> there is none
[12:54:09] <ChuckWorries> oh no
[12:54:11] <Brodingo> two things at once too hard
[12:54:22] <jeffsmykil> ugh the jquery ui modals dont even work in ie 8
[12:54:29] <pifantastic> bro
[12:54:33] <pifantastic> I bet they do
[12:54:37] <pifantastic> but you're fucking it up
[12:54:42] <pifantastic> THERE I SAID IT
[12:54:45] <jeffsmykil> probably the case
[12:55:03] <jeffsmykil> and I bet you have no friends, because you're a douche bag.  There I said it ;)
[12:55:11] <pifantastic> probably the case
[12:55:27] <pifantastic> but maybe next time
[12:55:29] <Brodingo> ?g ie8 black png transparency
[12:55:29] <pifantastic> you'll think
[12:55:30] <bot-t> Brodingo, javascript - PNG Transparency Problems in IE8 - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1251416/png-transparency-problems-in-ie8
[12:55:42] <ChuckWorries> IE is such a pain in the ass
[12:55:44] <pifantastic> before you just blat out a frustrated and useless comment like that
[12:55:55] <jeffsmykil> ChuckWorries: amen
[12:55:59] <Brodingo> IE is really cool and fun to use
[12:56:14] <pifantastic> One time IE saved my dog from drowning in a well
[12:56:18] <ChuckWorries> IE6... legend.
[12:56:19] <pifantastic> and then took us out for burgers
[12:56:20] <sphinxxx> can people grow some chops and just stop supporting IE completely
[12:56:26] <sphinxxx> then youll how quickly it phases out
[12:56:30] <ChuckWorries> and my school still uses it
[12:56:34] <NoiseEee> sphinxxx: some people actually design for a clients etc that use it
[12:56:35] <Brodingo> lol yeah good idea
[12:56:39] <NoiseEee> sphinxxx: we get your gist

[12:59:32] <kborchers> actually that's just wasting my time which isn't appreciated

[13:17:40] <`teh1> instead of parent().parent().parent(), which seems silly

[13:30:39] <RingZer0> Im using fancybox to load up an external URL, but I keep getting: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://wordpress.org/. Origin http://www.txinsurance.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:30:54] <yan_nick> hey guys, it's possible to reset the url when it was manipulated with history api?
[13:30:56] <yan_nick> history.pushState(null, null, 'foo'); -> how can i reset it to the original url?
[13:31:08] <RingZer0> but I have used FB many times before and am not new to jquery...
[13:31:51] <RingZer0> yan_nick: what do you mean "reset" the url?
[13:31:52] <kborchers> ?sop @ RingZer0

[13:32:15] <imsky> bot-t you're back
[13:32:22] <yan_nick> RingZer0: so i can get the original url
[13:32:27] <yan_nick> RingZer0: before manipulating

[13:32:38] * bot-t hugs kborchers back
[13:33:01] <RingZer0> kborchers: thanks.  but I still am not sure how FB does it on their website
[13:33:53] <RingZer0> see, on http://www.fancybox.net/ they do it right in their example area.
[13:34:37] <RingZer0> but with their example as the bot has said, complains, but still displays... the complaint: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://www.fancybox.net/ from frame with URL http://maps.google.com/?output=embed&f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=London+Eye,+County+Hall,+Westminster+Bridge+Road,+London,+United+Kingdom&hl=lv&ll=51.504155,-0.117749&spn=0.00571,0.016512&sll=56.879635,24.603189&sspn=10.280244,33.815918&vpsrc=6&hq=London+Eye&rad

[13:35:06] <RingZer0> kborchers: yeah, i am launching with options object type:'iframe'

[13:36:44] <gorhgorh> hi there, i have a silly problem with a .each func, i want to add the value of  radio button that are showed/hided with a checkbox , to do that i made a func that loops for :checked checkbox and then add the checked radiobutton.val() , i have 2 radio lists but if i select 2 radio options, it just sums the first val two times, any clue ? (http://jsfiddle.net/Z85Mn/5/)
[13:38:26] <RingZer0> gorhgorh: since javascript does not have a concat opperator it relys on + ... therefore if your variable's data type is int, it will add.  try .tostring
[13:39:24] <gorhgorh> i want it to be added, infact :)
[13:40:10] <gorhgorh> but yep i chanded this line, to a +=
[13:40:16] <gorhgorh> http://jsfiddle.net/Z85Mn/6/
[13:41:16] <RingZer0> lol  all about the operator
[13:41:34] <gorhgorh> my problem is different, if i check the 2 cheboxes, it add twice the first radio button not the first and the second one
[13:42:20] <gorhgorh> this is a .each issue i guess â€¦ but i'm quite silly when it comes to js â€¦ grrr :)
[13:43:13] <kborchers> RingZer0: you also need the iframe class on that link
[13:43:26] <kborchers> not very clear in their docs but i see that in their examples
[13:43:44] <sphinxxx> gorhgorh, i dont really understand the problem
[13:44:10] <gorhgorh> sorry, it is diffuclt to explain simply
[13:44:17] <gorhgorh> i'll try a better explanation
[13:44:33] <gorhgorh> if you check the 2 checkbox in my example
[13:44:42] <gorhgorh> and select only ONE radio button
[13:45:01] <gorhgorh> it will add twice the value of the radio button
[13:45:06] <sphinxxx> right
[13:46:03] <gorhgorh> what i want is :  if the 2 check box are checked, and 1 radio only is selected, it outpu it's value
[13:46:18] <gorhgorh> il 2 radio options are selected it add them
[13:47:02] <gorhgorh> now it add twice the first value, or twice the second if none in the first select are checked
[13:47:15] <gorhgorh> is it clearer ?
[13:47:29] <RingZer0> kborchers: so weird, i will try with that.
[13:47:29] <grid_> djQuery: i made already a solution, it is just parent.test(); that seems to work, blah :) in the index.html i have set test(): to alert("blah");
[13:47:30] <sphinxxx> ok
[13:48:01] <grid_> djQuery: strange that my friend couldnt find the solution, he is programmer 20 days a week
[13:48:06] <kborchers> i modified your site via the chrome dev tools to add that class and it worked fine so that should do it RingZer0
[13:48:56] <ShaunR> how do i get an elements name in jquery... i was trying alert($(this).parent().getElementByName()); but no go.
[13:49:03] <RingZer0> kborchers: omg, that is rediculas
[13:49:40] <RingZer0> such an awesome plugin, but dang.  you'd think users could control their own selectors
[13:50:49] <kborchers> RingZer0: you can keep your fb class but you just have to add the iframe class as well
[13:52:10] <nsheretic> does anyone know how i could access the elements of an iframe with jquery without refreshing the entire page?
[13:52:23] <nsheretic> i try doing $('#frame').contents().html()
[13:52:30] <nsheretic> but that refreshes my whole page for some reason
[13:52:38] <nsheretic> i'm not even trying to do a refresh
[13:52:44] <nsheretic> i'm just trying to get the value of an element in the iframe
[13:54:59] <kborchers> ?contents @ nsheretic
[13:54:59] <bot-t> nsheretic, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[13:55:56] <nsheretic> yes, that is what i'm using
[13:56:04] <nsheretic> but all it's doing is refreshing my entire page

[13:57:45] <sphinxxx> gorhgorh, i'm redoing it in the fiddle, almost done
[13:58:17] <gorhgorh> whaoo thanks sphinxx an explanation would have benn enought :)
[13:58:51] <gorhgorh> i understand what was going wrong, but no clue on how to fix it hÃ©hÃ©h
[13:59:47] <sphinxxx> it can be done with a lot less code
[13:59:54] <m3t4> Ìû
[14:00:37] <gorhgorh> i'm a silly css addict, this must be my heavyest script ever wrote :)
[14:00:52] <gorhgorh> i really need to learn a lot more about js  =(
[14:01:37] <gorhgorh> anyone have some good link for a total noob to learn, by the way ?
[14:01:40] <chovy> how do i get the first item in a list of items returned by $(".items")
[14:01:56] <kborchers> ?eq @ chovy
[14:01:56] <bot-t> chovy, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:02:09] <Snerf> if a .resize() event called when you change the height/width of an object?
[14:02:12] <Snerf> is..
[14:02:13] <chovy> kborchers: i thought there was a .get() for that.
[14:02:51] <xckpd7> is there a low level presentation / tutorial on doing live/delegate? I already know the basics of what it does, I just want to know if there is a presentation / human explanation / etc
[14:03:51] <sphinxxx> gorhgorh, why do you hav e the values of the radios different that the number its showing?
[14:04:08] <gorhgorh> cause i'm silly ;)
[14:04:10] <kborchers> chovy: get would give you the first element eq would keep it as a jQuery object i believe
[14:04:17] <gorhgorh> there was text before
[14:04:27] <gorhgorh> i changed it to number for the fiddle
[14:04:55] <gorhgorh> and yes i did realised that the 3 "label" had a 4 value :)
[14:07:30] <chovy> i have a list of jquery objects that are radio buttons, how would i check if anyone of them is selected?
[14:08:22] <kborchers> ?is @ chovy
[14:08:22] <bot-t> chovy, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[14:08:25] <kborchers> :selected
[14:13:02] <sphinxxx> gorhgorh: http://jsfiddle.net/Z85Mn/24/
[14:13:33] <RingZer0> kborchers: I just have 1 more thing, i have read the documentation, read other ppls posts on it, but can't get height/width to work.
[14:13:59] <gorhgorh> thanks a LOT sphinxxx â€¦ i'll try to learn from that !!!
[14:14:14] <sphinxxx> it's a little more complicated than i thought it would be
[14:14:27] <RingZer0> this is exactly what i have for its init:  $('a.iframe').fancybox({ 'width' : 800, 'height' : 600, 'type' : 'iframe', 'autoScale' : false });
[14:14:35] <sphinxxx> and also the total doesn't reset if you uncheck a checkbox, but that's an easy fix
[14:15:48] <gorhgorh> this is already a good starting point, i need to understand what you did, and tweak it to make it work, thanks again anyway
[14:15:54] <JStalin> hi, I just stumbbled on some problem. I'm writting on some modification to some system I don't want to mess with the existing code to much. I'm adding a button to a table row. But table row has click event assigned, which shows some menu. I don't want my button to show this menu. How the hack do it?? Again: button is a child of a cell which is a child of row.
[14:16:12] <JStalin> Am I allowed to do such a thing?
[14:16:21] <JStalin> is it possible?
[14:16:42] <gorhgorh> and yes, this seems simple at first, but is a bit more complex when you get down to details :)
[14:17:03] <RingZer0> understand your transversing selectors
[14:17:20] <RingZer0> .parents('tr:eq(0)')
[14:18:30] <JStalin> I don't want to change existing code. Just assign new click event to button. How to block menu from showing from inside button.click(function()) ?
[14:18:58] <NoiseEee> JStalin: not going to happen without adjusting code
[14:19:13] <NoiseEee> JStalin: your new button automatically fires the listener in the parent
[14:19:38] <JStalin> damn, that what I was afraid of
[14:20:02] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: hey there.
[14:20:10] <JStalin> thx
[14:20:56] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: can you take a look at this: http://www.txinsurancepro.com/fancy-example/ and tell me why the box opens up so small?
[14:21:32] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: .fancybox() init is on line 97
[14:22:05] <NoiseEee> css
[14:22:09] <NoiseEee> im not looking through a bunch of code
[14:22:13] <NoiseEee> but basically, css.
[14:22:48] <NoiseEee> you can look at fancybox docs/support if there is any
[14:23:16] <MysterOnyx> alright, I'm trying something new. Now I'm trying to create jplayer instances via php. However, it doesn't seem to be working. Could you check this code and see why? http://jsfiddle.net/kQfHd/1/
[14:23:48] <MysterOnyx> I don't know if what i'm doing is even possible, but I'm trying to use php to echo out scripts
[14:23:50] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[14:24:12] <MysterOnyx> ok
[14:24:31] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: it supports height/width options
[14:24:37] <RingZer0> that dont seem to be applying
[14:24:57] <MysterOnyx> this is what the browser sees: view-source:http://mysteronyx.com/new_audio/new_audio3-attempt-jplayer.php
[14:24:57] <pentarex> hey guys can someone help me...  I want to create a dynamic table with .each loop, after calling .getJson but my <tr> is closed before the <td> why is this happening... this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/pentarex/Zqkzz/ (it will not work because of the servlet I am calling)
[14:25:09] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: the code is also only like 8 lines
[14:25:39] <pentarex> the structure looks like this <tr></tr><td>...</td><td>...</td>
[14:26:05] <NoiseEee> pentarex: append your <td>s to the <tr>, then finally append the <tr> to the table
[14:26:16] <NoiseEee> also, you don't append closing tags.
[14:26:38] <jaequery> anyone know how i can turn a postive number into a negative number?
[14:26:50] <NoiseEee> RingZer0: try '800px' instead of 800
[14:26:55] <pentarex> NoiseEee: what should I do with the closing tags? dont close them?
[14:27:47] <NoiseEee> pentarex: You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[14:27:49] <NoiseEee> sorry
[14:27:50] <pentarex> and also NoiseEee.. how I should append them to the <tr> ... $(Â¨tdÂ¨).append(Â¨<td>Â¨);
[14:27:54] <NoiseEee> pentarex: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:28:09] <pentarex> NoiseEee: its not php but whatever :)
[14:28:21] <NoiseEee> pentarex: create a <tr> element.  var tr = $('<tr>');   append your new TDs to tr.
[14:28:43] <pentarex> NoiseEee: thank you I will try it :)
[14:29:02] <MysterOnyx> ok, I fixed a missing quote. The page visibally looks correct, but the play button doesn't work. Can someone tell me if what I'm doing is even possible: view-source:http://mysteronyx.com/new_audio/new_audio3-attempt-jplayer.php
[14:29:45] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: learn to look at your debugger/console
[14:29:52] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: the mysteries are there to be solved!
[14:30:46] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: edit.mp3 => 'edit.mp3'
[14:31:02] <MysterOnyx> that's one problem lol, sorry I made a few dumb errors
[14:31:02] <exnihilo> If I have a div tree that is made up of container divs, each of which has header divs and body divs (which may have container divs), and I get $('.container'), what is the best way to .find('.header') that won't pull the headers from any child containers?
[14:31:40] <kborchers> ?children @ exnihilo
[14:31:41] <bot-t> exnihilo, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[14:31:44] <NoiseEee> exnihilo: http://api.jquery.com/children/
[14:32:11] <RingZer0> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/NJeQc/
[14:32:33] <MysterOnyx> NoiseEee one question... at the part where I'm initializing the jplayer at the beginning of the script, should I enclose it with a $(function()?
[14:33:26] <exnihilo> ya, I saw children, so here is my situation.  I'm trying to make a patch for jquery collapse because the original code doesn't take into account nested elements with the same class, and I don't know that the "header" item will always be in children
[14:33:49] <exnihilo> of course I could be greedy and fix it for myself and not put in a pull request :)
[14:33:52] <NoiseEee> RingZer0: with plugins, you'll get more help on the google rather than here, as people may not be familiar with it at all.  www.gog.is/fancybox/setting/width/height
[14:34:23] <NoiseEee> exnihilo: then .first() the find ?
[14:35:13] <exnihilo> I could do that, the original code lets you use multiple header objects (I use the term header, in his case they are expand triggers)
[14:35:56] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: there's a lot of things that could be better really :)   for one, you probably don't need 3 different .jPlayers; you set the mp3 of the single jPlayer object on demand and always call the same one
[14:36:04] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: but thats up to you to code/implement
[14:36:04] <Eviltwin> exnihilo: What's the problem with the nested ones?
[14:37:16] <exnihilo> basically, you pass $('.myexpandclass') and the original code does $('.myexpandclass').find(triggers) which gets all child triggers, and you end up doing a wrapInner on the same element multiple times
[14:38:17] <Eviltwin> exnihilo: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[14:38:55] <Snerf> does the .resize() event only work for window ?
[14:39:22] <Eviltwin> Snerf: Yes, I believe so
[14:39:34] <Snerf> well, that blows
[14:39:37] <Snerf> ok..
[14:39:41] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to detect the change in an element's height, I don't think there's any way to do that
[14:40:13] <pifantastic> Snerf: have whatever is causing the element to resize trigger a custom event
[14:40:48] <pifantastic> elements don't tend to resize on their own, unless the window is also resizing
[14:41:02] <Snerf> thats exactly it. I am using browser on Android Tablet, and my div's are not showing the overflow at all properly, no scroll br, and it is sizing the elements all wrong as a result
[14:41:05] <someprimetime> how can i add append a div when bound to a scroll only once?
[14:41:20] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: see ?.one
[14:41:20] <bot-t> someprimetime, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[14:41:22] <someprimetime> e.g. user scrolls and i append a div somewhere, but it only adds itself once
[14:41:26] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks
[14:41:31] <someprimetime> B)
[14:42:33] <Snerf> ok. so if i call the elements resize event, would that make it trigger its resize event?
[14:42:34] <Eviltwin> That means that the next time that event happens, the handler gets triggered
[14:42:37] <Eviltwin> And then never again
[14:43:12] <pifantastic> Snerf: rework that question
[14:43:30] <conanbatt> hey guys. I am working in a gaming application similar to chess. I want a user to configure settings of a game through a dialog, and when he clicks "Save", its actually opens up a new tab in the browser. Normally i do this with an anchor, but somehow putting a jquery-button-anchor in the dialog doesnt work so weel
[14:43:31] <conanbatt> well
[14:43:36] <Snerf> pifantastic, would $(div).resize() call $(div).resize(function() {
[14:43:52] <pifantastic> Snerf: yes
[14:43:55] <conanbatt> because the button in the dialog is a button first, and an anchor later, it eats up the click first,
[14:44:01] <Snerf> pif, thanks.. will try that out
[14:44:03] <pifantastic> http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[14:44:29] <Snerf> pifantastic, the docs dont even tell you it only works for window, i read them
[14:44:54] <pifantastic> "The resize event is sent to the window element when the size of the browser window changes:"
[14:44:58] <pifantastic> that is directly from the docs
[14:45:12] <Snerf> pifantastic, doesnt say it does not work for others tho, its misleading
[14:45:29] <Snerf> anyhoo.. will try it out.. thanks

[14:49:28] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: does one() need to be bound to an event?
[14:49:47] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Uh, yeah, what did you think it does?
[14:50:04] <Krinkle> someprimetime: it's line bind() but it does unbind() after it's triggered for the first time
[14:50:12] <someprimetime> cause say i have $(window).bind('scroll', function() { â€¦ and want to insert it in thereâ€¦
[14:50:26] <someprimetime> because i'm cloning a div and want to append a drop shadow css class i have for it once
[14:50:57] <Krinkle> you don't bind one() to an event, one() is what binds the event.
[14:51:02] <Krinkle> to an element
[14:51:26] <Krinkle> someprimetime: bigger picture please, jsfiddle or jsbin perhaps ?
[14:51:33] <someprimetime> ok h/o one sec
[14:51:49] <Krinkle> or alternatively Just Do It, and see what happends
[14:52:04] <someprimetime> Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/J4JNT/
[14:52:19] <someprimetime> see where it says stickyDiv.append('<div class="drop_shadow"></div>');?
[14:52:30] <someprimetime> right now it's appending that class every single time i scroll down
[14:52:34] <someprimetime> i just want to add it once
[14:52:43] <someprimetime> so i'm not even sure one() would be the proper method to use?
[14:52:55] <MysterOnyx> Can someone check out my updated code? I'm trying to figure out why jplayer won't play the sound when I click play: http://jsfiddle.net/aWqW2/1/
[14:53:32] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/UaF22/
[14:54:28] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense
[14:54:40] <Krinkle> someprimetime: Why not just append that div outside the bind('scroll') ?
[14:55:06] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: eh not really :|
[14:55:16] <Eviltwin> Great :P
[14:55:18] <someprimetime> Krinkle: because it needs to be added only when the top portion of the page is hidden
[14:55:20] <someprimetime> haha
[14:55:32] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: How about this? http://jsfiddle.net/UaF22/
[14:55:39] <Krinkle> so add it before the bind, save it in a variable and call show() from the bind()
[14:55:48] <Krinkle> and potentially call hide() somewhere else
[14:57:50] <gorhgorh> sphinxxx: thanks again, i'll tweak it more tomorow, but i'm close to the goal :)
[14:58:01] <gorhgorh> good night everybody ;)
[14:58:16] <surfdue> Eviltwin: ps the fix was changing the hide/show to opacity
[14:58:26] <Krinkle> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/J4JNT/1/
[14:58:32] <surfdue> otherwise moving the divs caused the resize to be called.
[14:59:02] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Nice
[14:59:14] <Krinkle> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/J4JNT/3/
[14:59:15] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i did however discover another issue when i did that.. lol
[14:59:39] <Eviltwin> Good luck on that one
[14:59:49] <surfdue> Eviltwin: this one dosnt seem as complex..
[15:00:04] <surfdue> Eviltwin: atleast this one is very predictible it happens every time not speradically
[15:00:36] <Eviltwin> Sorry, you've exhaused the time I've allocated to your issue ;)
[15:01:01] <surfdue> aww i can make it upto you :p
[15:01:06] <someprimetime> Krinkle: i love you in a very bromance kind of way
[15:01:09] <MysterOnyx> Eviltwin I know you're not great with jplayer, but I think my problem is a general javascript / jquery problem. Could you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/aWqW2/1/
[15:01:15] <someprimetime> i was trying to do a ghetto version of that, but it works
[15:01:17] <Krinkle> someprimetime: :)
[15:01:20] <someprimetime> thanks a ton bud
[15:01:26] <Krinkle> you're welcome
[15:01:27] * surfdue wishes ajpiano was around
[15:01:30] <someprimetime> and thanks Eviltwin as well
[15:01:31] <surfdue> he knows ace. :P
[15:01:34] <someprimetime> *goes to study your code*
[15:01:36] <MysterOnyx> I have an alert that's supposed to go off in the middle of that script, but it doesn't happen
[15:02:09] <MysterOnyx> why that code isn't running is beyond me
[15:02:40] <Eviltwin> MysterOnyx: Thought I explained this to you yesterday
[15:03:24] <MysterOnyx> Eviltwin which part
[15:03:32] <Eviltwin> You were here as andrrres right?
[15:03:37] <MysterOnyx> yea I switched
[15:03:59] <AfroTurf> if I want to find all the li's that are showing is it .find("li:visible") ?
[15:04:45] <MysterOnyx> evil I completely changed my approach to the site, as you can see from the code
[15:05:45] <Eviltwin> MysterOnyx: I'll give you a hint
[15:05:52] <Eviltwin> The problem is on the left side of the screen
[15:06:21] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[15:07:22] <AfroTurf> does ":hidden" find display:none; ?
[15:07:28] <Eviltwin> ?:hidden
[15:07:29] <bot-t> :hidden: Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[15:07:34] <Eviltwin> Look
[15:07:39] <Eviltwin> At that link
[15:07:40] <coldhead> ?tias
[15:07:40] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:08:04] <Sudden_> if i have a <a href="xyz"> inside a <td class="hi">. and i want to trigger .click on the td. can jquery know which specific <a href="xyz"> that's inside just that <td> that was clicked? so i can fetch the href attribute and do a window location on that?
[15:08:25] <surfdue> Eviltwin: fixed :)
[15:08:26] <AfroTurf> oh ya says it right there :)
[15:08:33] <AfroTurf> i don't know how to look sometimes
[15:08:39] <imsky> Sudden_: yes
[15:08:40] <MysterOnyx> coldhead I restarted my site from scratch today, and for some reason one of my scripts is not running. Would you be able to take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/aWqW2/1/
[15:08:44] <imsky> ?g jquery event target @ Sudden_
[15:08:44] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: Only one <a> inside?
[15:08:45] <bot-t> Sudden_, event.target – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[15:08:51] <Eviltwin> Or only one <a href="xyz">?
[15:09:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I misread
[15:09:32] <Sudden_> Eviltwin: a normal <a> hyperlink inside
[15:09:38] <MysterOnyx> sorry coldhead, here's the one without onLoad: http://jsfiddle.net/aWqW2/2/
[15:09:42] <Eviltwin> Yeah something along the lines of $("td.interesting").click(function(e) { $(e.target).closest("a").attr("href") });
[15:09:57] <Sudden_> ty :)
[15:09:59] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to jquery  and wonder how i could solve this: i have a json object like this http://pastie.org/3059738 and wonder if there is an way to check for the highest "top" value, and if there are several results return me the one with the highest height
[15:10:09] <Eviltwin> MysterOnyx: That MooTools may also be screwing with you, set it to No-Library
[15:11:05] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: But I have to ask why you're not binding to the A itself
[15:11:08] <MysterOnyx> here it is with no library http://jsfiddle.net/aWqW2/4/
[15:11:18] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: Or simply allowing for the default behavior
[15:11:30] <destryalhmns> hello jquery
[15:11:35] <coldhead> MysterOnyx: it's better to avoid onclick= when you're using jQuery
[15:11:35] <imsky> hello
[15:11:38] <coldhead> use ?click
[15:11:39] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:11:41] <surfdue> Eviltwin: this is lookin real nice now.. :P
[15:11:47] <surfdue> i think it can be my new girlfriend
[15:11:47] <destryalhmns> anyone here jquery mobile?
[15:12:02] <MysterOnyx> coldhead ok I'll change that
[15:12:10] <surfdue> Eviltwin: any good with names?
[15:12:12] <Eviltwin> MysterOnyx: Correction, avoid using onclick
[15:12:13] <Sudden_> hm, the final result i want is to have the whole td as a hyperlink. i have a script that puts out several links, should i go about this in another way?
[15:12:25] <Eviltwin> surfdue: What do you mean?
[15:12:39] <Eviltwin> MysterOnyx: Regardless of whether it's with jQuery or not
[15:12:48] <MysterOnyx> ok
[15:13:22] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3966027/make-link-in-table-cell-fill-the-entire-row-height ?
[15:13:44] <destryalhmns> if anyone does do jquery mobile can you tell me why the <meta name="viewport" content="blah"> does not seem to be supported by ipad or android tablets??
[15:14:03] <imsky> it is supported, just not the way you want
[15:14:10] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6459806/how-to-make-entire-td-a-link
[15:14:11] <Sudden_> thanks Eviltwin, that's probably a better way to solve it :)
[15:14:21] <destryalhmns> i cant get it to do anything
[15:14:22] <Eviltwin> Sudden_: That last link has a checkmarked solution
[15:14:24] <Eviltwin> Look at that
[15:14:42] <destryalhmns> not set dimensions, or disable user zoom, or se tthe initial scale
[15:15:00] <destryalhmns> it just flat out doesnt work... and im like ...what the hell
[15:15:02] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: That's really not got anything to do with jQuery, does it?
[15:15:13] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: I use this for one iPhone thing: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;">
[15:15:16] <Eviltwin> Give that a shot
[15:15:49] <destryalhmns> like i said it doesnt work
[15:15:56] <destryalhmns> it will take more than 3 seconds of google
[15:15:58] <mightym> well thanks you anyway!
[15:16:36] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: And like I said, I use that for a REAL, LIVE, WORKING iOS web app
[15:16:39] <Eviltwin> And it works perfectly fine
[15:16:47] <Eviltwin> So you've fucked something up somewhere else
[15:17:21] <destryalhmns> hold on..
[15:17:24] <Eviltwin> mightym: Sometimes we miss questions
[15:17:30] <Eviltwin> mightym: What's the problem?
[15:18:08] <mightym> Eviltwin: ah no problem, i just asked this: hey guys, I'm new to jquery  and wonder how i could solve this: i have a json object like this http://pastie.org/3059738 and wonder if there is an way to check for the highest "top" value, and if there are several results return me the one with the highest height
[15:18:18] <destryalhmns> this is the code and a picture i posted on an apple foum https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3558031?start=0&tstart=0
[15:18:23] <mightym> i found sty calles Math.max.apply
[15:19:02] <destryalhmns> and the problem isnt specific to that example... the viewport when used like that (or in any other way) is not working for me
[15:19:05] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: Pretty sure you want a semicolon, not a comma
[15:19:09] <mightym> but a) I'm not sure how to use that on a json object b) how to retune the matching element i a good way
[15:19:15] <destryalhmns> and it is kind of a jquery thing because of jquery mobile
[15:19:26] <destryalhmns> no its a comma
[15:19:38] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: So you're sure it's the right way to do it but it's not working...
[15:19:45] <destryalhmns> exactly
[15:19:57] <destryalhmns> 100% sure its the right way and 100% sure its not working
[15:19:59] <Eviltwin> And my way (which uses a semicolon and works in a REAL, LIVE, WORKING iPhone web app) is wrong
[15:20:04] <the_beginner_web> Hello
[15:20:29] <the_beginner_web> i need help please
[15:20:35] <the_beginner_web> with date picker !
[15:20:36] <Eviltwin> mightym: So you're trying to find a "max" element?
[15:20:43] <destryalhmns> well i could try a semicolon
[15:20:52] <destryalhmns> but all documentation everywhere on the internet says comma
[15:21:10] <destryalhmns> im just trying to get it to do anything
[15:21:14] <destryalhmns> thats just an example
[15:21:16] <coldhead> MysterOnyx: this is kind of a debugging nightmare, i have changed the code in your fiddle and i still see alert('hi')
[15:21:25] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: Like I said, I want you to try what I typed verbatim
[15:21:30] <Eviltwin> And see if it works
[15:21:34] <the_beginner_web> can any one help me ?
[15:21:34] <Eviltwin> I really don't care if you think it's wrong
[15:21:36] <the_beginner_web> please
[15:21:40] <Eviltwin> the_beginner_web: see ?ask
[15:21:40] <bot-t> the_beginner_web, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:21:49] <destryalhmns> i will try it
[15:21:52] <the_beginner_web> i want to change the date form
[15:21:55] <the_beginner_web> of date picker
[15:21:58] <destryalhmns> the tablets are at work so i cant try right now
[15:22:05] <mightym> Eviltwin: yes but i don't need the value to returned, i need the complete "sub object" â€¦ in this case the note with key x
[15:22:22] <Eviltwin> mightym: I'll show you
[15:22:27] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web  dateFormat option
[15:22:27] <destryalhmns> okay well thanks for the lead
[15:22:37] <Eviltwin> mightym: Are you always checking for the max top
[15:22:43] <Eviltwin> Or are you sometimes looking for others?
[15:22:54] <the_beginner_web> i'm beginner .. where can i find dateFormat option
[15:22:58] <the_beginner_web> or how can change it ?
[15:23:04] <mightym> Eviltwin: only max top
[15:23:14] <Eviltwin> the_beginner_web: Read through the options here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[15:23:21] <mightym> Eviltwin: ah eh â€¦ sometimes for max width ...
[15:23:35] <mightym> but i can adjust it if i know how its works for height :)
[15:23:48] <the_beginner_web> i was there but i don't know how to change it ? what to do ?
[15:23:55] <the_beginner_web> what file i must change ?
[15:24:00] <courpse> This may seem silly, but you can have 2 .click() right?
[15:24:06] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ the_beginner_web
[15:24:06] <bot-t> the_beginner_web, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[15:24:07] <courpse> Each on different selectors.
[15:24:10] <Eviltwin> courpse: As many as your heart desires
[15:24:17] <courpse> Eviltwin, I gathered.
[15:24:25] <Eviltwin> mightym: Does this have a "length"?
[15:24:33] <Eviltwin> Like an array
[15:24:44] <the_beginner_web> i'm confused a lot ! any way thank you :)
[15:25:01] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ the_beginner_web
[15:25:01] <bot-t> the_beginner_web, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[15:25:02] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web when you call the datepicker method you pass it a set of options
[15:25:26] <BinaryKitten> the options are listed on the datepicker's page on the options tab
[15:25:37] <BinaryKitten> with examples and explanations
[15:25:39] <the_beginner_web> you mean $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker(OPTIONS ?);
[15:25:44] <mightym> the "notes" node has a length, its length can vary
[15:25:44] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web yes
[15:25:49] <surfdue> i didnt see your response earlier sorry
[15:25:51] <surfdue> my client messed up
[15:25:54] <surfdue> @ Eviltwin
[15:25:57] <Eviltwin> mightym: But the length corresponds to the number of notes?
[15:26:10] <mightym> yes
[15:26:25] <the_beginner_web> i want to change the date form to dd-mm-yy, and i want to change the / to - : so what option i must use ?
[15:27:04] <destryalhmns> good god there is a jquery mobile channel!!!!!!!!
[15:27:19] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: Calm down
[15:27:22] <Eviltwin> Everyone here is a volunteer
[15:27:26] <Eviltwin> No one is obligated to help you
[15:27:28] <Eviltwin> Be patient
[15:27:32] <destryalhmns> ?
[15:27:41] <the_beginner_web> i want to change the date form to dd-mm-yy, and i want to change the / to - : so what option i must use ?
[15:27:45] <courpse> Well this is balls, my minimal case works on jsfiddle but not locally.
[15:27:51] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web date format
[15:28:12] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: Could you code him an example? I don't think he's understanding
[15:28:14] <the_beginner_web> i mean what code i must put between ( ) ?
[15:28:49] <Eviltwin> mightym: Have you worked with console.log before?
[15:28:53] <the_beginner_web> Eviltwin : yes thanks i need an exemple :)
[15:29:04] <the_beginner_web> no ! :/
[15:29:44] <mightym> Eviltwin: you mean a output to the browser console?
[15:29:47] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin i would but the examples are there on the docs page.
[15:29:52] <Eviltwin> mightym: Yup
[15:29:52] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web  http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[15:30:00] <mightym> Eviltwin: yes
[15:30:01] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: Oh, perfect
[15:30:09] <the_beginner_web> Thanks All :)
[15:30:56] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web you will need to click options then the arrow next to dateFormat
[15:31:23] <the_beginner_web> $.datepicker.parseDate('yy-mm-dd', '2007-01-26'); ?
[15:32:18] <the_beginner_web> oh okay options then date format
[15:32:46] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web yep. it's an option you set as part of the datepicker
[15:33:02] <the_beginner_web> okay thanks :)
[15:33:18] <the_beginner_web> Yesssssssss it work :)
[15:33:29] <BinaryKitten> didn't doubt it for a moment
[15:33:30] <the_beginner_web> Thank you very much :) :D
[15:33:39] <BinaryKitten> the_beginner_web  when in doubt, consult the docs 1st
[15:33:43] <Eviltwin> mightym: http://jsfiddle.net/VhWFH/
[15:33:47] <Eviltwin> Err
[15:34:02] <Eviltwin> mightym: http://jsfiddle.net/VhWFH/1/
[15:34:07] <BinaryKitten> sorry to rtfm you but thats where i go to get you the answers
[15:34:13] <the_beginner_web> what is this ?
[15:34:15] <the_beginner_web> o.O
[15:34:17] <the_beginner_web> link ?
[15:34:43] <surfdue> what method does jquery ui use for tabbing?
[15:34:47] <the_beginner_web> any way it's work :)
[15:34:54] <Eviltwin> the_beginner_web: You see how there's someone else's nickname at the front with a colon
[15:34:58] <Eviltwin> the_beginner_web: That means its for someone else
[15:35:06] <the_beginner_web> oh ok
[15:35:10] <Eviltwin> You're not the only one here
[15:35:16] <the_beginner_web> i must go now .. thanks & bye :)
[15:35:21] <Eviltwin> surfdue: You mean like in their code?
[15:35:28] <mightym> Eviltwin: uh, thank you very very much! i will  try to understand it right now â€¦ thx so much :)
[15:35:37] <Eviltwin> mightym: I think I explained well enough there
[15:35:40] <Eviltwin> One thing to note
[15:35:45] <Eviltwin> I switched the way the "notes" is represented
[15:35:59] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i found out the issue heres the lodown give me a suggestion where to move forward. When I am doing the hide/show thing i need to issue a manual resize for the plugin to work correctly.. probably due to changing display block / hidden. However when using opacity's everything worked fine, EXCEPT i couldnt click on the editor because technically they were all layered on top of each other, just hidden... DUR
[15:36:11] <Eviltwin> You were mapping each thing like 0:, 1:, 2: with a length: 3
[15:36:16] <mightym> Eviltwin: ah i see
[15:36:17] <surfdue> so I guess I have a few options.. do this the right way, or use z-index and opacity :P
[15:36:19] <Eviltwin> That's basically an array so I just made it an array
[15:36:37] <Eviltwin> If you aren't familiar with the syntax, there are pretty pictures here: http://json.org/
[15:36:38] <mightym> Eviltwin: thats find, i don't need the index, i thought its a must
[15:36:46] <mightym> fine
[15:36:50] <mightym> not find
[15:37:57] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Use a z-index if you need to
[15:38:13] <surfdue> ok that seems to work
[15:38:16] <surfdue> jeez its so ugly.. lol
[15:38:27] <surfdue> im just making the hidden ones 0 and the front one 9999
[15:38:35] <surfdue> ugly as in the code, not my design
[15:38:39] <surfdue> my design is scrumptious
[15:40:05] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i really think you will enjoy what I am doing now :P
[15:40:49] <surfdue> Eviltwin: its not much, but you've been pledged.. I hope i get some sort of priority support now... ;)
[15:41:29] <BinaryKitten> surfdue have you signed up to the fairly priced VIP list?
[15:41:47] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: no but i just gave Eviltwin some mula. :P
[15:41:58] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Guess it depends on how much you've pledged :P
[15:42:03] <surfdue> (and its better then monopoly funds)
[15:42:08] <surfdue> Eviltwin: $25 to start
[15:43:04] <Eviltwin> Thanks
[15:43:10] <surfdue> <3
[15:43:25] <surfdue> Eviltwin: I think we could mutally assist each other.
[15:43:42] <josh9> i use jquery and got some event handling inside document.ready. i also have some js functions i am calling from those events. it terms of namespacing and organizing my code, where should i locate those functions? should i have myApp = {}; and myApp.myFunction = function myFunction(){console.log('hi')}; ?
[15:43:48] <Eviltwin> Well I can't make any promises about availability or assistance here
[15:43:51] <Eviltwin> I'm purely volunteer
[15:44:04] <Eviltwin> But I did spend a fair bit of time helping you yesterday and today
[15:44:17] <Eviltwin> Far more than anyone else
[15:44:19] <BinaryKitten> josh9 don't name your functions
[15:44:28] <josh9> BinaryKitten: why?
[15:44:33] <BinaryKitten> myApp.myFunction = function() { }
[15:44:50] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you have myApp.myFunction AND myFunction out there
[15:45:52] <josh9> BinaryKitten: ok
[15:45:57] <KWhat_Work> there a history.pushState plugin for jquery ?
[15:46:03] <BinaryKitten> josh9 also use closures where possible
[15:46:16] <BinaryKitten> KWhat_Work jquery bbq
[15:46:20] <josh9> BinaryKitten: ok
[15:46:35] <surfdue> Eviltwin: thus why i pledged :)
[15:47:02] <surfdue> Eviltwin: if it wasnt for you and ajpiano i wouldnt be able to launch this app in beta on newyears
[15:47:17] <KWhat_Work> BinaryKitten: that also deal with location.hash when needed or is it a html5 only solution
[15:47:49] <BinaryKitten> it works with all sorts of theings KWhat_Work
[15:48:40] <BinaryKitten> surfdue you haven't pledged, you've donated (sorry pedant in me) pleged is like promising
[15:49:49] * BinaryKitten gets all pedantic and then goes to get food as she's probably grumpy due to lack of food
[15:49:55] <Eviltwin> It's because I used pledgie
[15:50:25] <Eviltwin> http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[15:51:02] <coldhead> We've raised $28.00, but still need $999,972.00!
[15:51:02] * BinaryKitten grumbles .... ** damn silly site naming people learn to use the language damnit!
[15:51:09] <coldhead> read for the stars, Eviltwin
[15:51:15] <coldhead> reach* good grief
[15:51:23] * BinaryKitten walks off slowly mumbling to her self
[15:51:32] <Eviltwin> coldhead: It asked for a goal
[15:51:38] <coldhead> merry christmas, BinaryKitten!
[15:51:39] <Eviltwin> So I went optimistic
[15:51:48] <coldhead> well played, ET
[15:52:03] * BinaryKitten bungles over and hugs the breath out of coldhead :D
[15:52:26] * coldhead retracts his poisonous spikes
[15:52:36] * BinaryKitten is immune
[15:53:02] <coldhead> i would ordinarily get all uppity at someone asking for $$ in #jQuery, Eviltwin, but seeing as how it's you... <3
[15:53:09] <Eviltwin> Hah
[15:53:17] <Eviltwin> I threw it up because in my first week or two here
[15:53:28] <Eviltwin> About 30 people promised me a beer if I ever saw them in person
[15:53:37] <Eviltwin> In like Sweden or Austraila or whatever
[15:53:45] <coldhead> i have an amazon wishlist for those people :D
[15:53:48] <someprimetime> what do i use to find out if there is a specific class within a div? like hasClass, but to look deep inside all children elements of a parent div?
[15:53:51] <Eviltwin> And I don't plan on leaving the States any time soon
[15:54:09] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: where are you from?
[15:54:12] <Eviltwin> surfdue: $("parent:has(.class)")?
[15:54:16] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Chicago
[15:54:23] <Eviltwin> Err that was also for you someprimetime
[15:54:28] <Eviltwin> The $("parent:has(.class)")
[15:54:29] <someprimetime> haha ok awesome thank you
[15:54:35] <someprimetime> chicago seems like a nice place to visit
[15:54:40] <someprimetime> i'm from SF/bay area
[15:54:48] <Eviltwin> So that's all things that match "parent" and has something inside with class "class"
[15:55:00] <coldhead> chicago has the best recording studio in the world
[15:55:02] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: perfect, worked flawleessly
[15:55:05] <someprimetime> flawlessly, rather
[15:55:15] <Eviltwin> Guess your sentence wasn't flawless
[15:55:15] <someprimetime> coldhead: no wonder kanye west is so popular
[15:55:20] <coldhead> >: |
[15:55:29] <someprimetime> burn :(
[15:55:37] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Which studio are you referring to?
[15:55:41] <someprimetime> or should i say wind burn cause it's chicago
[15:55:41] <coldhead> it's true, and any retort looks racist
[15:55:47] <coldhead> electrical audio, Eviltwin
[15:59:15] <courpse> alert($('.class').attr('id')); //html has <div class="class" style="border: 1px solid #000;" id="test">
[15:59:20] <courpse> It returns undefined.
[15:59:25] <courpse> Um, why?
[16:00:01] <Eviltwin> When are you running that code?
[16:00:16] <courpse> oh.
[16:00:50] <Eviltwin> 'Cause it works fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/jxyxA/
[16:00:51] <courpse> Heh, its just directly in a <script>, i was trying to debug where $('.class').click(function() { alert('test'); }); wouldn't even trigger.
[16:01:01] <Eviltwin> Doc ready
[16:01:18] <courpse> Something weird is happening, :/
[16:01:38] <Eviltwin> Alright, BBL guys
[16:01:41] <Eviltwin> Good luck to all
[16:01:50] <coldhead> have fun Eviltwin
[16:21:02] <someprimetime> if I assign a container to a variable such as var container = $('#container'); how can I reference just the #container later on with using the variable I assigned it to?
[16:33:58] <zoran119> how can i do something like $('.blah').on('load,click', function() {.....
[16:34:28] <zoran119> so do this thing when the matched elements are clicked, but also when they are loaded....
[16:54:02] <abjorn> so for you slow pokes who missed it: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/

[17:40:48] <borillion>  how is this site doing its menu's http://evault.com/, when you click on for example "Why EVault?" the next page that loads has it with a different backround?
[17:42:35] <kkuno> I don't remember:
[17:42:50] <kkuno> how can I select the i th element of a jquery object
[17:43:05] <kkuno> like  $('div')[i]
[17:51:06] <borillion> kkuno, $("div:eq(2)")
[17:51:28] <borillion> kkuno, but the first one is = 0 not 1
[17:56:22] <kkuno> borillion, thanks
[18:02:28] <yan_nick> hey guys, o
[18:02:40] <yan_nick> how can i detect whether i'm currently hovering an element
[18:03:14] <coderDJ412> hi yan_nick
[18:03:17] <coderDJ412> hello all
[18:03:23] <yan_nick> hey coderDJ412
[18:03:42] <eddiemonge> yan_nick: bind an event to mouseover?
[18:05:01] <eddiemonge> check e.target
[18:05:38] <dismist> yan_nick $('.selector').hover(function() { function() { ..object entered.. }, function() { ..mouse leaves object..} );
[18:05:57] <yan_nick> have problems with fancybox and mouseover, i try...
[18:05:58] <LordThumper> I am using placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight'on a sortable list
[18:06:29] <LordThumper> It is highlighting the position where the <li> will be inserted. is there any way to highlight the entire list?
[18:06:31] <cvelde> hey there, i got a question about .live : is it actually able to sort the importance of handlers like css? e.g. if id had one ("a").live and one ("a.foo").live handler, will it handle a.foo over a?
[18:07:24] <yan_nick> dismist: eddiemonge http://pastebin.com/i0tmGq8Y
[18:07:46] <yan_nick> but when fancy box displays a new image my hover isn't executed :c
[18:07:55] <eddiemonge> cvelde: itll attach them both but you should try to stop using live
[18:08:23] <yan_nick> cvelde: dich gibt es ja auch noch :D
[18:08:26] <eddiemonge> yan_nick: what are you trying to do?
[18:08:55] <yan_nick> eddiemonge: the image caption should be displayed when hovering the fancy box image
[18:09:05] <cvelde> eddiemonge: well yeah, but what will ("should" to be more precise) actually happen if i attach both and click <a class="foo">bar</a>?
[18:09:47] <eddiemonge> cvelde: both will be fired, in the order you attached them
[18:09:53] <coderDJ412> can someone explain to me why doing p[p.lenght] = 10; add to an array
[18:09:55] <coderDJ412> ?
[18:10:38] <yan_nick> coderDJ412: do you want compare? then use ==
[18:10:48] <coderDJ412> i don't want to compare
[18:10:58] <coderDJ412> i just want to know what's happening
[18:11:11] <coldhead> because arrays are 0 indexed, so an array with 3 elements will have indexes 0, 1, 2 and when you assign the element with index p.length that will be 3, a new element
[18:11:29] <coldhead> but don't do it that way, it's horrible
[18:11:29] <eddiemonge> ?eval var arr = ['a','b','c']; arr[arr.length] = 'd', arr.length
[18:11:31] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 4
[18:11:44] <coldhead> ?mdc push
[18:11:45] <bot-t> coldhead, push - MDN - Mutates an array by appending the given elements and returning the new length of the array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[18:12:10] <cvelde> eddiemonge: any idea how to do it cleanly without attaching a different class to all other links?
[18:12:19] <coderDJ412> thanks guys
[18:12:46] <eddiemonge> cvelde: do what?
[18:13:03] <coderDJ412> coldhead, i'm not doing it that way
[18:13:07] <cvelde> eddiemonge: well, have a handler for all links but a different one for specific links
[18:13:26] <eddiemonge> coderDJ412: the point was that you should be
[18:13:28] <coderDJ412> i am using head first jquery book and it does it that way in one of the scripts
[18:13:41] <eddiemonge> ?filter @ coderDJ412
[18:13:41] <bot-t> coderDJ412, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:13:59] <coldhead> thanks for letting us know, coderDJ412, i'm going to contact the publishers to complain
[18:14:26] <olinux> how to check if any of <select multiple> are selected?
[18:15:41] <olinux> ok i see .val() returns null
[18:15:42] <coderDJ412> coldhead, look at line 100 on  here: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1999278909
[18:16:45] <eddiemonge> wow that is full of not goodiness
[18:16:53] <coldhead> ross, thanks coderDJ412
[18:16:56] <coldhead> gross*
[18:17:07] <eddiemonge> i didnt even get past line 10
[18:17:17] <coderDJ412> coldhead, wow
[18:18:04] <cvelde> is it really wasting 60 lines to create a set of cards?
[18:18:07] <coderDJ412> coldhead, do you see what i'm talking about
[18:18:19] <coderDJ412> cvelde: its a book for beginners
[18:18:28] <eddiemonge> a bad book
[18:18:28] <coderDJ412> with NO programming exprience
[18:18:35] <gloomer> olinux object:selected?
[18:18:37] <coderDJ412> its help me understand a lot
[18:19:13] <cvelde> coderDJ412: even then, why learn it the bad (but simple) way? sometimes you have to hammer your head against the wall ;-)
[18:19:23] <eddiemonge> why are there two ace of clubs?
[18:20:14] <coderDJ412> programmer mistake :)
[18:20:22] <coderDJ412> Take it easy i'm a beginner, lol
[18:21:00] <coldhead> you're doing fine, coderDJ412
[18:21:08] <coldhead> that code just follows some bad practices
[18:21:25] <coldhead> case in point, you had to ask about that business with p[p.length]
[18:21:33] <coderDJ412> line 107 and 108 confused me
[18:21:52] <coldhead> i'm sure you'll learn from it but keep going when you're done :D
[18:21:55] <coderDJ412> my other js books told me that it added to the arrary
[18:21:59] <cvelde> eddiemonge: and the ace of hearts is missing *sob*
[18:22:07] <coderDJ412> i just added
[18:22:19] <eddiemonge> used_cards.push(index); hand.cards.push(c);
[18:22:22] <coderDJ412> i copy and pasted and then did a find and replace
[18:22:56] <coderDJ412> before i looked at my other js book, i thought the lenght property was read only
[18:23:05] <coderDJ412> just found out it was read and write
[18:23:21] <coldhead> it's not a great thing that it's writeable
[18:23:48] <cvelde> why would you do such a thing? o.O
[18:25:26] <coldhead> because you are perverse, i guess
[18:25:30] <coderDJ412> lol
[18:25:50] <coderDJ412> i'm saying that to say that now the code makes more sense to me since i know its writable
[18:26:00] <coderDJ412> i didn't write the code, the book did
[18:26:03] <coderDJ412> i'm just following
[18:26:10] <coldhead> no one is blaming you, coderDJ412
[18:26:18] <coldhead> it's going to be okay
[18:26:21] <coldhead> it's not TERRIBLE code
[18:27:08] <coderDJ412> cool
[18:39:06] <coderDJ412> Does anybody in here still buy books?
[18:45:29] <caaakeeey> do people here use anythign special for forms?
[18:45:39] <coldhead> html
[18:46:16] <coldhead> caaakeeey: here's some nice html5 form stuff http://24ways.org/2009/have-a-field-day-with-html5-forms
[18:46:18] <eddiemonge> coderDJ412: http://jsfiddle.net/P4Rfy/
[18:48:34] <coderDJ412> thanks eddiemonge!
[18:49:38] <caaakeeey> coldhead, thanks
[18:53:12] <eddiemonge> i still buy books
[18:53:49] <coderDJ412> i just got the js & jquery missing manual books in the mail!
[18:53:54] <coderDJ412> so excited to read them
[18:55:12] <Rndnick> hi
[18:55:32] <Rndnick> is there a way i can let create a div that cancles all on upper divs
[18:56:31] <gloomer> ?
[18:56:47] <gloomer> dont understand question
[18:56:55] <eddiemonge> divs have cankles now?
[18:56:55] <Rndnick> like
[18:56:59] <Rndnick> ignore the parent dive
[18:57:09] <Rndnick> *div
[18:57:19] <eddiemonge> what do you mean when you say ignore the parent div?
[18:57:27] <gloomer> ignores its css style?
[18:57:29] <gloomer> or?
[18:57:33] <Rndnick> gloomer : yes
[18:58:06] <gloomer> do
[18:58:21] <gloomer> $('#object').removeClass('class');
[18:58:30] <gloomer> and remove the parent div css
[18:58:34] <eddiemonge> Rndnick: no
[18:58:51] <eddiemonge> css children inherit from the parent
[18:59:00] <eddiemonge> you would have to override all its styles
[18:59:24] <Rndnick> im putting my main div in an unknown parent div
[18:59:31] <Rndnick> so i cant toutch it
[18:59:55] <eddiemonge> why would you do that?
[19:01:58] <Rndnick> why would i do what
[19:02:16] <Rndnick> its just the current situation
[19:34:54] <cpgo>  I'm calling $.ajax with dataType set to json and php header('content-type: application/json'); but the data on my complete function is an Object with readyState, status, responseText, etc. Shouldn't the data be a json object?
[19:37:22] <courpse> using $('.class').click(function() { }); doesn't seem to trigger when DOM is used to create an element later on, do i need to use a different function than .click?
[19:37:53] <danzik17> cpgo: no, the first argument for complete is the jqxhr.  success uses the dataType converter.
[19:37:53] <cpgo> courpse, look at .live()
[19:38:25] <courpse> Ta.
[19:39:02] <cpgo> danzik17, docs say success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)
[19:39:28] <courpse> cpgo, Yep, much better thanks.
[19:39:29] <danzik17> cpgo: yes.  you didn't say success, you said complete.
[19:39:39] <cpgo> oh
[19:39:47] <cpgo> sorry
[19:50:18] <mos`> i heart jquery
[19:50:45] <JakeyChan> me too
[19:51:03] <JakeyChan> question, what's api can get the html content of dom ?
[19:51:12] <JakeyChan> not the dom children
[19:53:53] <dr0id> ?
[19:54:24] <JakeyChan> get full html string including the selected element itself
[19:56:34] <dr0id> outerHTML
[19:57:41] <JakeyChan> dr0id: thanks !
[19:58:39] <dr0id> don't thank me yet, cause this time there's no support in FF, LOL
[20:00:48] <dr0id> you could actually try adding a block element to the dom, then clone the node, get the innerHTML of the new dom node and then remove the dom node from dom.
[20:01:08] <JakeyChan> ok. actually, it doesn't work
[20:01:11] <JakeyChan> :)
[20:02:04] <dr0id> outerHTML should work in anything but FF
[20:02:26] <dr0id> ohh, check the second answer here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8263071/how-to-get-the-full-html-string-including-the-selected-element-itself
[21:14:08] <aaairc> how can you test whether a selector actually found an element in your html, or if the selector found nothing?
[21:15:12] <aaairc> .size() == 0?
[21:15:26] <aaairc> $().size() == 0... would that do the trick?
[21:17:01] <jaequery> if theres a string like http://www.bla.com/hello ,  how can i just get the bla portion out?   sometimes the string is http://bla.com/hello , http://subdomain.bla.com/hi ... etc ...
[21:22:20] <gloomer> using javascript string functions
[21:23:19] <voot545> learn regex
[21:24:56] <gloomer> or just use php parse url
[21:25:54] <voot545> there's a 3rd party javascript library parseuri I think it's called; it can also do that
[21:30:02] <markamber> I am not really good with JQuery yet, how would I make a tooltip that fades in and moves up (like coda download) and have it show up whenever a user has its cursor hovering over a table row (I know I am using tables, deal with it) and assemble the tooltip based on the items data attributes (like data-tooltip, data-preview-image)
[21:30:45] <markamber> I am kind of limited on how I can implement things because I am using php and listing things from a database
[21:43:20] <gloomer> markamber, that is many problems in one
[21:43:24] <gloomer> just take it one step at a time
[21:54:35] <markamber> gloomer: sorry, I left for a sec
[21:55:33] <markamber> gloomer: so I can handle the actual tooltip popup
[21:55:55] <gloomer> ok
[21:56:14] <markamber> my question is with the dynamic content creation
[21:56:35] <markamber> can I just use any div and show it?
[21:57:47] <gloomer> ya
[21:58:11] <gloomer> your going to be getting info from row of td element your  on
[21:58:28] <gloomer> so just monitor  .hover
[21:58:35] <gloomer> and use parent to get whole row
[21:58:44] <gloomer> and iterate td's to pull info for tooltip
[22:01:37] <markamber> so I can create some sort of div and append the elements from (this) like this.data('tooltip') or however you access, and then append more of the div like closing tags and opening new ones, then append the content (details) and then append closing the tags and closing the div and then just position that and show it with the animations right gloomer
[22:04:37] <gloomer> sounds good to me :)
[22:04:51] <gloomer> easier said then done but not too bad
[22:06:28] <markamber> gloomer: isn't everything
[22:07:08] <markamber> gloomer: actually I take that back, so many things (like tech support) are way easier done than said
[22:07:16] <destryalhmns> anyone do jquery mobile?
[22:07:31] <markamber> yes
[22:07:33] <markamber> but not me
[22:07:36] <destryalhmns> awesome
[22:07:41] * markamber just had to say that
[22:07:52] <destryalhmns> ...
[22:08:12] <destryalhmns> too bad, i was going to give $1000 to the first person who did jqm
[22:08:21] <destryalhmns> you see, i am from the jqm publishers clearing house
[22:09:08] <gloomer> lol
[22:09:13] <joshualibrarian> how can I select the nth element of a certain class (in a certain div) from the dom?
[22:10:12] <destryalhmns> start with something like $(mydiv).find(class :nth)
[22:10:23] <gloomer> :nth-child()
[22:11:27] <joshualibrarian> oh sweet, referencing now.  thanks, gloomer!
[22:12:00] <gloomer> np
[22:12:12] <Zxurian> http://americancruiselines.com/electronic_brochure.php - can anyone tell me why my mousemove() event isn't working in internet explorer? (click on the large brochure display for zoom, you'll be able to se the proper effect in any other browser)
[22:13:38] <destryalhmns> fyi in firefox you see image boxes before the image loads
[22:14:08] <Zxurian> yea, it's just work in progress right now, but I want to make sure the actions work before I move onto refinement
[22:14:08] <destryalhmns> looks good in chrome
[22:14:21] <Zxurian> ie is what's killin' me right now
[22:14:28] <destryalhmns> actually, it might be okay in ff, i have everything disabled so i can use it to view dirty pornography
[22:16:14] <destryalhmns> did you put an alert box at the front to verify it never goes in there?
[22:16:42] <Zxurian> never goes in where?
[22:16:50] <destryalhmns> mouse move handler
[22:17:11] <destryalhmns> this http://pastebin.com/Mg8syE5U
[22:17:38] <Zxurian> so adding an alert inside mousemove, doesn't fire in ie
[22:18:08] <Zxurian> i know the div being binded to is at the top most level through css checking
[22:18:46] <destryalhmns> script debugging enabled in ie?
[22:19:38] <Zxurian> it is, and no problems reported
[22:19:52] <destryalhmns> wait
[22:19:55] <destryalhmns> it works for me
[22:20:02] <destryalhmns> its supposed to zoom on mou over
[22:20:04] <destryalhmns> ?
[22:20:07] <Zxurian> zoom yes
[22:20:13] <destryalhmns> yep, works
[22:20:14] <joshualibrarian> gloomer:  so I've got what appears to be the number of the current slide in a var called current... I want the current-th element with class="slide"... so...
[22:20:14] <Zxurian> and scroll when you move mouse
[22:20:14] <joshualibrarian> $('.slide : nth-child('+current"')')
[22:20:14] <joshualibrarian> no?
[22:20:36] <destryalhmns> dont believe me... give me a sec..
[22:21:17] <Zxurian> destry: the effect is supposed tto be that you click to zoom in, then move hte mouse over the zoomed in image, and it'll auto-scroll the image in percentage to the mouse over the div
[22:21:56] <Zxurian> destry: works in every browser, but ie, and it's bugging the crap out of me. Is it possible that Ie doesn't bind the mousemove event to div that's got display: none ?
[22:22:54] <gloomer> joshualibrarian $('.slide' :nth-child(numVariable)).whatever
[22:23:10] <gloomer> err sorry bad quotes
[22:23:13] <gloomer> quotes go around whole thing
[22:23:22] <gloomer> joshualibrarian $('.slide :nth-child(numVariable)').whatever
[22:23:25] <joshualibrarian> aha!  thank you!
[22:23:37] <meesebyte> Assistance por favor: (ping: Eviltwin) I've tried to make .goodies explode(fade effect) when I click the .portclick block with no luck. http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/Y9rbK/232/
[22:23:50] <destryalhmns> z-index?
[22:23:52] <destryalhmns> isk
[22:23:55] <destryalhmns> *idk
[22:24:08] <destryalhmns> but in my opinion "it" (whetever it is) looks a lot better in ie
[22:24:45] <Zxurian> no, z-index isn't it. the div with the event is top-most, that I alreayd checked
[22:25:30] * destryalhmns makes a test page
[22:28:14] <joshualibrarian> hmm.. syntax error.
[22:28:42] <joshualibrarian> I'm pretty new to jquery, I don't have to escape from the string to insert the variable?
[22:30:42] <gloomer> yes escape var
[22:30:55] <gloomer> just concat with +
[22:33:01] <destryalhmns> well the mouseover method is working in ie
[22:33:03] <destryalhmns> http://pastebin.com/mC8HUUCK
[22:33:18] <Zxurian> destry: lol,, yea, just found th eissue
[22:33:29] <destryalhmns> what was it?
[22:34:00] <dismist> i need to save areas of an ajax'd interface (for example, when a user clicks on an option in a select box, a list of configurable options is loaded up below it...).  Should I write the configuration into a jSON object and save it into a data element with jquery for each select item?
[22:34:01] <Zxurian> destry: apparently if I don't put "something" inside the div, ie doesn't actually render it as an element, or whatever the technical term is
[22:34:10] <Zxurian> destry: i just added a background, and it works fine now
[22:34:23] <destryalhmns> oh yeah
[22:34:34] <destryalhmns> lots of times &nbsp; is used
[22:34:47] <Zxurian> destry: hate ie
[22:35:15] <joshualibrarian> what method is handy for finding out about an object I've gotten from a selector?  to see, say, what kind of object it is, what are it's attributes?  Is there a handy function like that?
[22:35:28] <gloomer> dismist, there are many proven methods for ajax select drop downs
[22:35:31] <gloomer> why reinvent the wheel
[22:35:33] <Zxurian> destry: interestingly, &nbsp; doesn't work
[22:35:37] <dismist> gloomer: please advise
[22:35:50] <destryalhmns> that's weird
[22:35:54] <dismist> for each item in the drop-down, there's about 10 different configuration options that can be set
[22:35:55] <destryalhmns> well as long as it is working
[22:36:24] <Zxurian> destry: lol, adding &nbsp; just makes the mosuemove event work over the actual footage occupied by the "space", not the entire blocked out div
[22:36:26] <dismist> on the change event, i'd like to ask the user if they want to save changes to current item before loading saved changes from another item
[22:36:43] <destryalhmns> sounds like you need to size that div
[22:37:01] <dismist> yeah whats this talk about a div with no content in it being rendered as non-existant?
[22:37:03] <Zxurian> destry: it already has width & height dimensions
[22:37:07] <dismist> thats not true at all.. not even in ie6
[22:38:10] <Zxurian> http://americancruiselines.com/electronic_brochure.php - example
[22:38:32] <Zxurian> != IE : mousing over the entire div works properly, and scrolls the image properly
[22:38:46] <Zxurian> == IE: only when mousing over the actual text, does it properly active the .mousemove() event
[22:39:03] <Zxurian> (in example, click on a brochure image to zoom in to see problem
[22:39:15] <destryalhmns> I DONT LIKE IT
[22:39:28] <destryalhmns> its too clunky
[22:39:40] <destryalhmns> just let them download the brochure if they are blind
[22:39:58] <destryalhmns> or link them to something bigger
[22:40:05] <destryalhmns> OR
[22:40:06] <Zxurian> it's not up to me. customer gets what customer wants.
[22:40:10] <destryalhmns> nm no one cares what i think
[22:40:37] <destryalhmns> customers need to be kept in line
[22:40:42] <gloomer> ya, i broke it in chrome using left button
[22:40:44] <destryalhmns> give me their number
[22:41:40] <Zxurian> after it goes live, feel free to call them. americancruiselines.com
[22:42:01] <destryalhmns> at least put the zoom div not directly over top of the brochure
[22:42:24] <Zxurian> destry: that is what they want.
[22:42:58] <Zxurian> my only issue rightt now is why ie / jquery isn't doing what it's supposed to be doing (as far as my knowledge of both goes)
[22:43:56] <gloomer> they can't possibly want the zoom positioned there its like impossible to use
[22:43:59] <gloomer> put it below or something :)
[22:44:22] <Zxurian> it's been gone over many times with them. That's what they want
[22:44:44] <destryalhmns> so the ie div problem is its just not sized right?
[22:45:02] <Zxurian> it is sized in css.
[22:45:12] <destryalhmns> but not rendered right
[22:45:17] <Zxurian> the problem is the mousemove eveent only seems to be working over the actual text, not the entire div
[22:45:33] <destryalhmns> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[22:45:41] * destryalhmns sees the text
[22:45:59] <Zxurian> even using developer tools within ie, you can click the selector, and try to hover over it, and it won't actually select the hover div unless you mouse over the text, even though the div actually occupiees the entire space
[22:46:13] <Zxurian> hell, even mouseing over the text, ie develoepr tools shows the blue outline around the entire idv
[22:46:42] <destryalhmns> its doing something for me
[22:46:47] <destryalhmns> i think the problem is the plugin
[22:46:58] <destryalhmns> move your mouse around a lot
[22:47:03] <destryalhmns> it does something
[22:47:14] <Zxurian> it's supposed to
[22:47:23] <Zxurian> but over the entire div, not just the text in the top corner
[22:47:37] <destryalhmns> no it is moving, thats what im saying
[22:47:41] <destryalhmns> the plugin is bad
[22:47:53] <Zxurian> it's not a plugin, it's from scratch
[22:48:10] <gloomer> only problem he is having is jquery mouseover event on div in ie whatever
[22:48:15] <destryalhmns> it works
[22:48:19] <Zxurian> yes, thank you gloomer
[22:48:30] <Zxurian> destry: in everything but ie
[22:48:35] <destryalhmns> for example, when i move the mouse right in the div area, the picture moves left (opposite of what it should)
[22:48:52] <Zxurian> destry: no, that is what should be happening
[22:48:59] <destryalhmns> lol idk then
[22:49:04] <destryalhmns> thats not what happened in chrome
[22:49:46] <Zxurian> that's unique to you then. page works fine for me in ff/chrome, on multiple machines
[22:50:03] <Zxurian> rather, "page works" = click tto zoom in, them mouve mouse over zoom-in to scroll image
[22:50:34] <Zxurian> in ie, the scrolling only activates when you move the mouse over the "HOVER ME" text in the top left corner, instead of the entire blocked out div like it does in ff/chrome
[22:50:52] <destryalhmns> no it doesnt
[22:50:57] <destryalhmns> im trying to tell you
[22:51:04] <destryalhmns> it works across the entire div
[22:51:27] <gloomer> which versionof ie
[22:51:30] <gloomer> ill test it
[22:51:36] <destryalhmns> 9
[22:51:36] <Zxurian> currently, i'm running IE9
[22:51:44] <destryalhmns> ill make a video...
[22:52:12] <Zxurian> i would love it if it's just my machine
[22:53:47] <gloomer> ya i see the issue
[22:54:24] <Zxurian> gloommer: thank you, at least i'm not going crazy
[22:54:24] <gloomer> what's your jquery selector look like
[22:54:26] <gloomer> and which event
[22:54:33] <gloomer> mouseover?
[22:54:34] <gloomer> hover?
[22:54:38] <gloomer> enter/exit
[22:54:46] <destryalhmns> uploading to youtube now...
[22:54:54] <Zxurian> http://pastebin.com/Mg8syE5U
[22:55:10] <Zxurian> mousemove
[22:55:23] <Zxurian> rather, binding the hover div to the mousemove event
[22:55:25] <destryalhmns> 45%
[22:56:54] <gloomer> Zxurian whats css look like on that div
[22:57:33] <destryalhmns>  http://youtu.be/dZqsQjhhj00
[22:57:41] <Zxurian> http://pastebin.com/XY7rU2fw
[22:57:50] <destryalhmns> or maybe this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZqsQjhhj00&feature=youtu.be
[22:58:13] <dismist> any way to preventDefault on the change event of a selectbox so that the next item does not get selected (there are ways beyond clicking and tab/arrow keys to change a select box's selected item
[22:58:18] <gloomer> Zxurian try adding background-image: url(#);
[22:58:20] <gloomer> to hover div
[22:59:11] <Zxurian> aaaand, now it works properly
[22:59:22] <Zxurian> destry: that's odd, I didn't get that effect no matter how many times I tested it
[22:59:46] <Zxurian> gloomer: so apparently ie has to have "something" to fill the entire div for the mosuemove event to move properly, if it's filled with nothing/
[23:00:26] <destryalhmns> yeah that is odd
[23:00:53] <gloomer> ya thats why i figure if it thinks image for whole bg it will fire
[23:01:06] <dismist> how do you stop the value of a select box from changing?:
[23:01:28] <gloomer> disable the select box
[23:01:40] <dismist> on what? on change?
[23:01:48] <Zxurian> how bizarely odd of ie. at least I know a workaround for it. I was actually about to attempt a background color with an opacity of 0,  but your method might be slightly cleanre
[23:01:53] <Zxurian> [cleaner]
[23:02:22] <gloomer> dismist, on whatever event that you want to disable the box
[23:02:44] <dismist> when someone tries to change the item, i want to prompt them and ask if they are sure
[23:02:45] <destryalhmns> it could be because im on a multi monitor system
[23:02:55] <gloomer> then monitor the .change
[23:02:56] <destryalhmns> but ive never ever had any problems before
[23:03:00] <dismist> would look pretty cheesy if it switched items then switched back and prompted them
[23:03:34] <destryalhmns> even with the most fily pornographic sites
[23:03:43] <destryalhmns> *filthy
[23:03:53] <destryalhmns> LIKE THIS ONE...
[23:04:18] <destryalhmns> http://www.hulu.com/watch/267770/orf-universum-documentaries-magic-of-the-mountains
[23:04:27] <gloomer> ya filthy
[23:05:32] <gloomer> dismist, use $('').change
[23:05:34] <gloomer> or mousedown
[23:05:56] <dismist> .change switches the item before you can preventDefault on it
[23:05:56] <Zxurian> destry: odd, but at least I got it solved for the time being. thanks for the assistance
[23:05:59] <Zxurian> gloomer: thanks to you as well
[23:06:09] <gloomer> np
[23:07:02] <destryalhmns> ^ (its still @#%5ed up in ie)
[23:07:29] <gloomer> just script them to chrome download page if they land with ie
[23:08:32] <dismist> mousedown would probably work but what if the sneaky little bastard changes it with their keyboard?>
[23:08:43] <dismist> or the million other ways you can alter thigns
[23:10:14] <gloomer> if (navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer) {window.location="http://www.google.com/chrome";}
[23:10:19] <gloomer> fix all your problems :)
[23:10:43] <gloomer> dismist, then just monitor .change event
[23:11:00] <gloomer> or monitor event for each way they can change it
[23:11:02] <gloomer> keydown
[23:11:03] <gloomer> etc
[23:11:05] <dismist> i am saying i cant monitor that event because the option switch occurs before that event launches
[23:11:15] <dismist> they could use a 3rd party program to change it
[23:11:27] <dismist> all the accessibility shit they have out nowadays
[23:11:53] <gloomer> lol, then what are you going to do ?
[23:12:03] <gloomer> you can either monitor events or not :)
[23:12:08] <gloomer> not really many options besides that
[23:20:00] <destryalhmns> so.... anyone have experience with meta name="viewport"???
[23:21:34] <gloomer> for ?
[23:23:09] <destryalhmns> need it for mobile apps
[23:23:24] <destryalhmns> like on mobile apps the user can zoom in so you need it to get screen dimensions
[23:24:54] <gloomer> $('meta[name="viewport"]').attr('content', '.....');
[23:25:03] <destryalhmns> with jquery mobile, for example, the page transitions are messed up if the page is bigger than the screen. so you need a way of making sure the page isnt bigger than the screen
[23:25:11] <destryalhmns> doesnt work
[23:25:12] <gloomer> ya
[23:25:16] <gloomer> which is what that is for
[23:25:26] <destryalhmns> no seriously
[23:25:28] <destryalhmns> trust me
[23:25:29] <destryalhmns> hold on...
[23:25:38] <destryalhmns> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3558031?start=0&tstart=0
[23:25:54] <destryalhmns> and ive tried that and every other method
[23:25:58] <gloomer> <meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height,width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0" >
[23:26:03] <destryalhmns> doesnt work
[23:26:22] <destryalhmns> i mean maybe on a phone it works
[23:26:27] <gloomer> how doesn't t work?
[23:26:36] <destryalhmns> but ive tested on an android tablet and an ipad2, doesnt work
[23:26:50] <gloomer> what about it "doesn't work"
[23:26:52] <destryalhmns> however, sites like wikipedia, yahoo, and npr are rendered correctly
[23:26:52] <gloomer> and what is your code
[23:26:55] <destryalhmns> nothing works
[23:27:12] <destryalhmns> cant set dimensions, cant set allow-scroll (or whatever it is) to false
[23:27:21] <gloomer> lets see your page jsfiddle
[23:27:28] <destryalhmns> i just linked it
[23:27:35] <destryalhmns> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3558031?start=0&tstart=0
[23:28:48] <gloomer> put it on jsfiddle so i can mess with it don't have link to your img
[23:29:24] <destryalhmns> i dont think it will work because of the browser you would be using but hold on and ill put it up
[23:30:30] <destryalhmns> need to change images to divs, although that should not change the problem
[23:35:41] <destryalhmns> http://jsfiddle.net/destryalhmns/HNKAu/
[23:36:12] <destryalhmns> thats not a good platform to test on
[23:37:03] <gloomer> ya i don't have a good mobile tester
[23:37:53] <dismist> u dont have that adobe thing
[23:38:00] <dismist> device central or whatever the fuck they call it
[23:39:51] <destryalhmns> they have an android one too but it is slow..... 10x slower than you would think anything would be in 2011
[23:40:16] <LordThumper> jquery for android?
[23:40:27] <destryalhmns> android emulator for windows
[23:40:37] <destryalhmns> or should i say..
[23:40:39] <LordThumper> oh ok
[23:40:47] <LordThumper> yes i used to develop for android
[23:40:52] <LordThumper> the emulator is terribad
[23:41:09] <destryalhmns> jquery mobile capable android webkit browser emulator for windows 7
[23:41:11] <LordThumper> Used to prefer uploading the .apk to the phone to debug lol
[23:41:43] <destryalhmns> ...for testing of the meta name = viewport tag
[23:43:03] <LordThumper> oh
[23:43:25] <LordThumper> Dunno how jquery works for an android phone...
[23:43:44] <destryalhmns> works the same
[23:44:02] <destryalhmns> but really the main problem is the display size and general shitty quality of mobile devices
[23:44:08] <LordThumper> oh
[23:44:19] <destryalhmns> google jquery mobile
[23:44:26] <LordThumper> ok
[23:45:20] <LordThumper> Yeah well the project I am working on, I think I will port it to tablets someday
[23:45:25] <LordThumper> So that should come in handy
[23:45:41] <destryalhmns> it takes 2-3 days to learn
[23:45:44] <destryalhmns> super easy
[23:45:51] <LordThumper> I have seriously started using jQuery 2 weeks ago
[23:46:22] <LordThumper> 40 hours a week, mixed coding. And I already got decent in it, so not surprised
[23:47:09] <LordThumper> I was lucky javascript syntax is familiar, as I usually code in C#
[23:47:13] <destryalhmns> you ever do css?
[23:47:16] <LordThumper> So that came quite handy
[23:47:22] <LordThumper> Yeah abit
[23:48:02] <destryalhmns> now i know we are on dangerous ground because youre a noob and im a dork and people on the internet gravitate towards hatred
[23:48:17] <destryalhmns> and this is sort of a joke but actually more of a slightly humorous observation
[23:48:19] <destryalhmns> ready?
[23:48:24] <LordThumper> sure
[23:48:49] <destryalhmns> when you set up a border in css, doesnt it KIND OF feel like you are ordering a penis?
[23:48:54] <destryalhmns> for example...
[23:49:03] <destryalhmns> 2px solid Black
[23:49:03] <hrwath> ;-o
[23:49:10] <LordThumper> lol
[23:49:14] <destryalhmns> kink od like ordering a penis? no?
[23:49:42] <khmer_> 5px ridged cyan
[23:49:45] <LordThumper> Well, it is kind of funny, but I never thought of it that way :) Because I usually 0px solid Black :P
[23:50:08] <destryalhmns> lol
[23:50:27] <destryalhmns> theres no reason to get defensive, no one was calling anyone else gay..
[23:50:39] <dismist> so what
[23:50:42] <LordThumper> lol I was not getting defensive
[23:50:47] <dismist> smells gay in here
[23:50:57] <khmer_> yeah plus if you add css animation
[23:51:18] <khmer_> transition: border 1s ease-in
[23:51:53] <destryalhmns> its a shame so few people get the outstanding quality of that joke
[23:52:20] <destryalhmns> "joke"
[23:52:27] <gloomer> programming and jokes don't work to well most the time
[23:52:39] <LordThumper> Why not?
[23:53:03] <LordThumper> Because jokes are not syntaxically correct?
[23:53:04] <LordThumper> lol
[23:53:15] <gloomer> haha
[23:53:18] <gloomer> fake laugh...
[23:53:35] <LordThumper> oh well, it was worth a try
[23:53:42] <destryalhmns> lol
[23:54:06] <hrwath> it was almost funny :)
[23:54:16] <LordThumper> thank you, thank you
[23:54:31] <hrwath> keep trying
[23:54:38] <hrwath> do what you believe in :)
[23:55:20] <khmer_> for (var D = 0; 8===D; D++) { // lol
