[03:31:40] <k0nichiwa> If the accordion was previously collapsed, ui.oldHeader and ui.oldPanel will be empty jQuery objects.
[03:31:46] <k0nichiwa> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#event-activate
[03:32:00] <k0nichiwa> how do i test if a 'jquery object' is empty ?
[03:33:20] <Cork> k0nichiwa: .length > 0
[03:34:15] <k0nichiwa> not $.isEmptyObject ?
[03:34:35] <Cork> that is for testing if an object is empty, not a jquery object
[03:34:45] <Cork> $.isEmptyObject({})
[03:34:46] <k0nichiwa> thx what i thought .. but didnt know the test you gave
[03:35:00] <Cork> jquery objects are an array like object
[03:35:10] <Cork> so you just check its length
[03:49:28] <k0nichiwa> seems im getting resizable plugin, accordian and sticky plugins all working together decently
[03:49:59] <k0nichiwa> only thing is when i make the accordian sticky it kind of bounces at the top as you scroll -- but it does stick, just not as smooth as ud like
[03:51:08] <Cork> how are you making the element sticky?
[03:53:22] <k0nichiwa> Cork hold on ill show u the link, plugin
[03:53:36] <k0nichiwa> http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/
[03:54:03] <k0nichiwa> im using the accordian to hide a map until user wants to see it
[03:54:19] <k0nichiwa> so it only has one element in it, its just used to hide and reveal the map
[03:54:36] <k0nichiwa> but when the map is in - use i want it sticky so it doesnt scroll off the page
[03:54:48] <k0nichiwa> so i use the sticky plugin to make the accordian stick when the map div is open
[03:54:53] <Cork> k0nichiwa: check what position value the element gets when it is "stuck"
[03:55:03] <Cork> that is most likely what causes the jittering
[03:55:12] <k0nichiwa> how would tha thelp me
[03:55:23] <k0nichiwa> i dont see how that would allow me to fix the problem
[03:55:35] <Cork> if you don't know what the problem is you can't ever fix it
[03:57:45] <k0nichiwa> i actually applied the resizable plugin to th emap and that worked also
[03:57:53] <k0nichiwa> kind of surprised it was so easy
[03:58:18] <k0nichiwa> with the map inside the accordian
[06:02:22] <memelord> One question if I may ask please, does anyone knows can I add somehow functionality to active dates in jquery datepicker so if today is 3 May when I click it I want to do me something for example to fetch some data.. ? Is it possible :)
[06:03:43] <Cork> wow... that is one messed up sentence...
[06:04:04] <preference> memelord: not sure if .click() would be what you want
[06:04:08] <Cork> memelord: check .datepicker('widget') and then you can attach most any thing you want
[06:04:54] <memelord> nah thats not problem but need to get which day is today and from that information to load data related to that day
[06:05:29] <preference> check the contents of the box after it's been selected and use that?
[06:08:17] <memelord> Yes, but by default I only see when inspect there is available data-year and data-month but no day.. Day is only what I need. If you understand what Im trying to say.

[06:21:43] <jmaister> Hi! I have an issue where I need to load a script async that needs a different jQ version. Is it possible to somehow scope the script to use a certain version?
[06:21:51] <jmaister> I don't have control over the script contents
[06:34:09] <ryan_ford> can you use an IIFE and noConflict?
[07:05:29] <Cork> ryan_ford: that question doesn't really make sense
[07:06:14] <Cork> jmaister: you can isolate jquery, but it is normally better to fix it so they can use the same version
[07:06:21] <ryan_ford> if he has 2 versions, he could pass in jQuery.noConflict and use that within the IIFE couldn't he?
[07:06:28] <Cork> jmaister: jquery is quite big and you don't really want to load multilple versions
[07:06:44] <Cork> noConflict(true) if you mean that ya
[07:07:14] <jmaister> Cork: Well, this site is a shitshow anyway
[07:07:20] <Cork> but but it is normally a really messy solution
[07:07:22] <jmaister> I'd not use jQuery at all if it was up to me
[07:07:58] <ryan_ford> what is the feature you need to support? I wonder if it would be easier to just add that in somehow instead
[07:08:01] <Cork> jmaister: what is requiring the different versions?
[07:08:17] <Cork> or just pick a jquery version that has both
[07:08:25] <Cork> or possibly jquery-migration.js
[07:08:33] <jmaister> It's a Microsoft™ Dynamics® Portals site and that uses an ancient version of jQ, then the UI uses Unify bootstrap stuff which uses jQ > 3.0
[07:08:59] <Cork> jmaister: what is the ancient version=
[07:09:01] <Cork> *?
[07:09:17] <jmaister> 1.9.1 I think
[07:09:26] <Cork> that isn't ancient
[07:09:38] <jmaister> 5 years is an internet eon
[07:09:42] <ryan_ford> i think that's what you get from code.jquery.com without specifying a version, right?
[07:09:57] <Cork> ya, but in compatibility point of view you most likely can just replace the 1.9 version
[07:09:59] <ryan_ford> the defacto
[07:10:09] <Cork> jmaister: though note 1.x isn't older then 3.x
[07:10:13] <Cork> they are different branches
[07:10:15] <ryan_ford> wouldn't he lose some i.e. support?
[07:10:22] <jmaister> Cork: I've tried that, but it breaks the site
[07:10:23] <Cork> if you leave 1.x ya
[07:10:44] <ryan_ford> the 2 migrations sound like best case
[07:10:49] <jmaister> Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery version 1.9.1 or higher, but lower than version 3
[07:10:56] <Cork> jmaister: btw why does it require 3.x that is insane...
[07:10:58] <ryan_ford> lol
[07:11:17] <jmaister> Idk anything about jQuery versions. I usually don't use it
[07:11:31] <jmaister> Would something that requires 3.x run on 1.9.x normally?
[07:11:45] <Cork> 1.12 is api compatible with 2.2
[07:11:55] <Cork> 3.x is a bit of a rewrite but not that big
[07:12:06] <Cork> jmaister: mostly ya
[07:12:45] <jmaister> Hm. Ok, I'll try that first then, and perhaps any plugins that doesn't want to play ball
[07:12:52] <jmaister> *replace
[07:13:03] <Cork> jmaister: 1.9 has .on and that has been one of the bigger changes in jquery in the last quite a lot of versions
[07:13:10] <jmaister> *sigh* I hate other people's code :P
[07:13:30] <jmaister> Cork: Like $(document).on()?
[07:13:35] <Cork> ya
[07:13:40] <jmaister> that's useful
[07:13:42] <Cork> or $('selector').on()
[07:13:47] <jmaister> aye
[07:13:56] <Cork> well before 1.7 is was just $(document).bind()
[07:14:00] <Cork> so not much of a difference
[07:14:04] <Cork> just name change
[07:14:20] <Cork> (they merged bind and delegate and called it on)
[07:30:54] <chrios> Wondering if anyone can give me a hand with creating a dynamic form using JQuery
[07:31:30] <chrios> I have a table and a button after it
[07:31:37] <Cork> chrios: make a jsfiddle and go as far as you can get and then ask for help
[07:31:47] <chrios> Okay, doing that now
[07:35:16] <chrios> Do I have to use their "collaborate" feature to share this fiddle?
[07:36:39] <Cork> no, just click save
[07:36:55] <Cork> (it is actually the preferred solution)
[07:39:56] <chrios> https://jsfiddle.net/kh0dznbv/
[07:40:14] <chrios> Okay cool so I've put the skeleton of what I'm trying to achieve here
[07:41:12] <Cork> and what is it you don't know how to do from here?
[07:41:16] <chrios> But I can't get the button back!
[07:41:51] <chrios> I've put an event listener on the "cancel" button to append the "add ingredient" button to the "ingredient" table
[07:42:07] <Cork> we.. you call detatch
[07:42:10] <Cork> so you remove the row
[07:42:46] <chrios> Yeah, when a user clicks cancel, I want the input fields to be replaced with the button originally (in my full app, the button is a bootstrap block button)
[07:43:10] <Cork> btw if ("#addIngredientButton") is not something that works
[07:43:25] <Cork> that is case will always be true cause !!"#addIngredientButton" == true
[07:43:54] <chrios> Okay so I can remove that if statement then I guess..
[07:44:13] <chrios> https://jsfiddle.net/kh0dznbv/2/
[07:44:20] <Cork> and also, as you detach and reuse the elements you don't need to bind click again and again
[07:44:37] <Silmarilion> The oldest date I can set in jQuery date picker is 1900-01-01, is there a way to set an earlier date?
[07:45:23] <chrios> Cork: You've lost me there... What do you mean? Am I approaching this the completely wrong way? Maybe some pseudo code?
[07:47:54] <chrios> Should I create toggleButton and toggleRow functions to toggle the elements, then bind the click event on the buttons calling those functions?
[07:48:25] <chrios> Sorry I'm a bit of a noob at javascript so I'm a little lost here
[07:48:27] <shadowswalker> hello guys, I have two button with same id="details" which has on click event as $("#details").click(function(){}) here with the help of $(this) I do something but only first button with that ID works, why ?
[07:51:28] <Cork> chrios: this should get you going https://jsfiddle.net/kh0dznbv/3/
[07:51:51] <Cork> shadowswalker: it is an id aka unique
[07:52:04] <Cork> shadowswalker: if you want multiple elements with the same selector use a class
[07:52:46] <shadowswalker> Cork: got it man, should use 'class' for this type of purposes
[07:52:51] <shadowswalker> thanks
[07:53:19] <Cork> well if you don't want to identify a specific element, don't use an id
[07:53:25] <Cork> it is kinda part of the name
[07:59:48] <chrios> This is better: https://jsfiddle.net/kh0dznbv/4/
[08:00:08] <chrios> I used the toggle() function and set the addIngredientRow display: none; in css
[12:45:19] <Groveport> Not sure how to make this toggle - https://jsfiddle.net/3g7wLuy3/
[14:53:11] <rudy> neato
[14:54:25] <Guest2727> ok
[14:54:36] <Guest2727> is this cowboy
[14:54:56] <Guest2727> ben_alman
[15:03:37] <ben_alman> is this the bass player?
[16:42:12] <vish93> hey guys in tinymce I have https://pastebin.com/atXemymm for valid elements. But, aria-label gets removed
[16:43:20] <vish93> even though I have added |aria-label
[19:34:37] <k0nichiwa> why do i have to sometimes enclose creation of  widget in $( function() { ... } ) ... odesnt that cause invocation on ducment ready ?
[19:34:47] <k0nichiwa> if im in document ready i shouldnt need it
[19:43:17] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa erm.
[19:43:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:43:58] <robertmaxrees> you're doing a doc ready in a doc ready?
[19:44:48] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa mind showing an example of this?
[19:48:08] <k0nichiwa> sure hold on
[19:49:33] <k0nichiwa> https://github.com/mysociety/jquery-multi-select/blob/master/demo/index.html#L42
[19:49:54] <k0nichiwa> just wondering if that construct is done so it executes on doc ready event ?
[19:52:15] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[19:52:27] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said it was within another doc ready
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> because yeah, that's what that does.
[19:53:50] <robertmaxrees> though you shouldn't need it in this case.
[19:54:14] <robertmaxrees> anyway i gotta go.
[19:54:18] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[19:54:52] <k0nichiwa> oh ok ... well its bnot in a doc ready handler THERE
[19:55:02] <k0nichiwa> i know, but ive put 'em inside my main doc ready handler
[19:55:11] <k0nichiwa> and they dont seem to work if i remove them from the inner doc ready handler
[19:55:17] <k0nichiwa> but i probaby just made a mistake
[22:17:38] <jak2000> hi all
[22:18:06] <jak2000> bootstrap have some buttons, but only 6,7 different buttons, wich framework recommend me with more buttons?
