[01:25:41] <Tekla> $('tr:last td') <-- this selects the tds in the last row of any table, right?
[01:26:29] <Tekla> is it the equivalent of $('td','tr:last')?
[02:04:00] <alxy> I have a question concerning third party library build on top of jqmobile: http://nativedroid.godesign.ch/v0.2.3/icons.html If you type "ca" in the input, you will seee a list of icons. However, only two icons are working (via data-icon attrivute), the rest isnt. I have no clue, why only a very small amout of icons appear, while the othrs dont
[02:04:12] <alxy> Can anybody have alook on this one and tell me why?
[02:28:33] <HiMaX> hello, why must i use the $(document).ready(function() { } instead of onload="func();" ?
[02:29:30] <HiMaX> why people laugh me and make fun of me when i use the onload="func();" ?
[02:37:56] <teitoklein01> hi guys, how do I add a value to input type = text with class as identifier
[03:47:02] <wa5ted> anyone know how to do paralax effect without js
[03:49:12] <zagaza`> http://css.dzone.com/articles/cool-parallax-scrolling-effect
[03:49:34] <wa5ted> that link
[03:49:37] <wa5ted> it looks terrible
[03:50:02] <zagaza`> what looks terrible?
[03:51:27] <wa5ted> the paralax on that link
[03:51:30] <wa5ted> the example
[03:51:32] <zagaza`> yep
[03:52:00] <zagaza`> css doesnt detect scrolling.. so you need to do it with transitions like that when clicking an internal link
[03:53:07] <wa5ted> true
[04:51:09] <Satche> Hello
[04:51:30] <Satche> I work on a project and i wonder if it is possible to create a kind of parallax using horizontal scrolling
[04:51:53] <Satche> Maybe it's a bit difficult because divs would scroll at different speed
[04:52:48] <Satche> like div.foreground=v ; div.midground=v-1; div.background=v-2 â€¦ etc.
[04:53:13] <Satche> Do you think it is possible ? Maybe someone have some links to share ?
[05:05:43] <Ventox> I have fixed top bar ... How can I create something that when Im starting to scroll down the bar`s class changes ?
[05:14:23] <Polar_> Ventox: just bind scroll event to something like $(".divclassname").attr('class', 'newclassname'); and add some logic
[06:22:47] <tristan1990> noob question: Can I use regular JavaScript in jQuery Mobile?
[06:24:54] <frank_o> tristan1990: Sure
[06:26:56] <tristan1990> frank_o Great. I've started building an app for ionic framework with angularjs. I've realised that I'm actually out of my depth. All I want to do is create a Google API autocomplete search to say the opening times of the selected store, display the store on the map. - Is there a much simpler way that I am missing for this? I'm thinking using jQuery may be a shorter learning curve
[06:41:17] <frank_o> tristan1990: Dunno sorry
[06:41:34] <tristan1990> No probs - any suggestions welcome!
[08:12:14] <ezz> I want to use templates in jQuery, how I can do that?
[08:49:00] <karamazo_> Any suggestions on a plugin for form styling?
[08:56:16] <roothacker> hey, I am encountering an issue with Ajax and Form post, where cancelling all AJAX calls made earlier to form post doesn't help in the speedy form post(instead the browser waits), not able to understand whether client side is the issue of concern or the server side
[08:56:16] <roothacker> replacing the form post condition with clicking on a hyper link poses the same issue
[08:56:16] <roothacker> also, this issue is replicated on both Chrome and Firefox
[09:12:10] <Velveeta> roothacker: what do you mean cancelling all ajax calls? a) are you talking about xhr.abort(), and b) how many ajax calls are you making to post a form?
[10:05:32] <djam90> I am having trouble with jQuery UI range slider. My code is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11119245 , the slider won't work. If I change it to use just numbers instead of the variables at the top then it works as usual. What am I doing wrong?
[10:09:20] <audran> Jadenn, check out the cache option for $.ajax - https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:09:36] <BillCriswell> djam90: min and max needs a number and .val() returns a string.
[10:10:03] <djam90> DAMN
[10:10:06] <djam90> Seriously?
[10:10:06] <BillCriswell> djam90: You could put a + before $('#used_car_min_price').val() and the other one and you should be ok.
[10:10:12] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:10:26] <djam90> what does putting the + there do?
[10:10:44] <BillCriswell> If the string is numeric it'll turn it into a number.
[10:10:54] <djam90> awesome
[10:10:59] <djam90> that has indeed fixed it
[10:11:02] <djam90> thanks a lot
[10:11:06] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:26:57] <Jadenn> audran: thanks for looking, but it turns out the cruft was added by cloudflare
[10:28:09] <wa5ted> dman it
[10:28:17] <wa5ted> Velveeta left again
[10:33:56] <shoky> it's just you now
[10:54:35] <CyberBotX> I was wondering if jQuery had a way of hooking into the browser's stylesheet changer. For example, in Firefox, if the user goes to View -> Page Style and picks a different stylesheet.
[10:58:27] <caleb_io> CyberBotX: I think maybe you can use onload on the stylesheet.
[10:58:36] <caleb_io> I don't think the CSS gets loaded until the user selects it, so you could probably determine it then.
[10:58:59] <CyberBotX> That's not true, even alternate stylesheets get loaded if they are in a link tag in the head.
[11:01:28] <caleb_io> Hmm, I wonder if there is any property that gets added to the ones that are inactive.
[11:02:01] <CyberBotX> There is a DOM property called disabled, yeah.
[11:02:33] <CyberBotX> It isn't that I can't figure out which stylesheet is the active one, it is more that I want to react when the stylesheet is changed from the browser's menu.
[11:03:40] <caleb_io> Well there's most likely not going to be an event for that so you'll probably have to monitor for the active stylesheet changing.
[11:04:09] <CyberBotX> Alright, just wanted to see if there was something I could hook in to. Thanks.
[11:05:48] <roothacker> Velveeta the ajax calls start after the page load, while the calls are in progress, if I click on a hyperlink, then the page takes sometime before reloading the page
[11:06:35] <roothacker> and even though, I abort all the ajax calls, still the browser takes the same X amount of time before reloading the page
[11:10:51] <roothacker> checking out the network tab in console also displays the networks as cancelled, though the amount of time, to do the redirection to another page increases as multiple of the number of ajax calls
[11:14:23] <hxm> i have this http://pastebin.com/1wv6BFGf which works, I see in the log how it works, but I dont see any alert, it appears a new window
[11:14:26] <hxm> what do I fail so hard
[11:19:26] <hxm> is jquery 1.10
[11:20:53] <caleb_io> You're doing 'event.preventDefault();" but where is the `event` coming from?
[11:21:07] <caleb_io> You've not got an argument named event in the function.
[11:33:12] <dcorbin_> When I call "$.ajax()", and specify "dataType: json", jquery appears to send "application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01" as the Accept header.  Why is sending "*/*?
[11:33:32] <dcorbin_> And more importantly, how I can make it NOT send that.
[11:34:47] <shoky> dcorbin_: "accepts" option
[11:42:34] <hxm> caleb_io: I changed it, but still the same http://ejecutor.bot.eggdrop.es/ click on Entrar and type anything
[11:43:43] <dcorbin_> shoky:  When I use "accepts", my accept header is undefined. :(
[11:45:15] <dcorbin_> shoky: do I need them both?
[11:45:41] <caleb_io> hxm: you have a js error on the page
[11:45:49] <caleb_io> "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'superfish' "
[11:46:28] <hxm> but that's the menu, the ajax is still working or no?
[11:47:24] <hxm> i disabled that but still
[11:47:44] <dcorbin_> shokay - reading the doc closer, it says "accepts" should be a "PlainObject".  But I'm not clear on how to represent "application/json" as "PlainObject" it will understand.
[11:50:17] <caleb_io> hxm: make sure the code in your document ready is actually getting ran (put a console log in there)
[11:50:44] <lilltiger> I im using this "http://vanderlee.github.io/colorpicker/" and in the documentation it says there is a function "setColor" but how do I call it? $("#my_colorpicker").setColor(color); dosent works, it says there is no such function.
[11:53:49] <BillCriswell> lilltiger: Are you including the plugin?
[11:54:22] <lilltiger> BillCriswell: yes, it shows up and works as it should, I just need to be able to set the color on the fly
[11:54:52] <lilltiger> BillCriswell: But I dont know how to call any of itäs own methods
[11:55:31] <caleb_io> I think you want to do $('#my_colorpicker').colorpicker('setColor', args..)
[11:56:08] <caleb_io> Or in your initialize the original .colorpicker might give you an object you have to keep around to call methods on.
[11:57:02] <lilltiger> caleb_io: trying it
[11:57:09] <caleb_io> Just tried it on their demo, it works.
[11:57:27] <caleb_io> You can also do $('#my_colorpicker').data().colorpicker to get the actual colorpicker object,
[11:57:39] <caleb_io> However it probably returns that same object from the initial .colorpicker
[11:58:51] <lilltiger> caleb_io: indeed $('#my_colorpicker').colorpicker('setColor', args..) works just fine, thanks
[11:59:01] <hxm> caleb_io: right, is not being executed, no idea why
[11:59:45] <caleb_io> I've never seen the on ready done that way.. just do $(function() { }); instead.
[11:59:56] <caleb_io> with all of your stuff being inside the function body.
[12:00:19] <caleb_io> It looks like your way would work, but just ruling things out
[12:06:50] <hxm> caleb_io: I moved it to the <head> and worked, but then I read your last lines and I tried it at the footer, and right, works
[12:06:52] <hxm> thanks
[12:07:00] <caleb_io> np
[12:07:04] <hxm> i found the jQuery(document). in the jquery doc
[13:57:22] <shoky> dcorbin_: sorry had to go. still need help with that?
[14:23:27] <dcorbin_> shoky: I got it working, by using a beforeSend function.  But it seems really braindead to me.
[14:39:49] <oquidave> hello could someone please help me here with jquery submit() function. It's not working for me http://pastebin.com/mZriNhNS thanks
[14:40:33] <oquidave> chrome console is giving the error Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[14:41:01] <shoky> oquidave: just don't call preventDefault if you want it to submit
[14:42:09] <oquidave> shoky: okay, let me try that
[14:43:54] <oquidave> shoky: i've commented it out...however, how come it still submits even when ive a  return function in the if statement
[14:44:08] <shoky> what?
[14:44:52] <shoky> returning has no affect on the submit
[14:45:01] <oquidave> shoky: see my if statement. It displays an error message to the user when no radio button is checked and prevents form submission...but it doesn't
[14:45:11] <shoky> it doesn't do anything to prevent it
[14:45:26] <shoky> "return" isn't supposed to prevent anything
[14:46:01] <shoky> maybe you mean "return false"  and that still wouldnt do anything here, only in the actual event handler callback (the function in line 11)
[14:46:14] <shoky> but it's better to just call e.preventDefault() when you want to prevent it
[14:46:23] <oquidave> shoky: so how do i prevent it...that's why i had put the e.preventDefault(); and then manually activate submssion with $("#quiz_form").submit();
[14:46:34] <shoky> just call e.preventDefault() IF you want to prevent
[14:46:41] <cfurrow> you should put your e.preventDefault() where your 'alert' is now, and remove the 'return'
[14:46:41] <shoky> and don't call .submit()
[14:47:02] <cfurrow> and remove your .submit() call inside your callback
[14:52:55] <oquidave> cfurrow: okay, it works now. My question is what's the use of the .submit() function then especially since i've been reading across the web that its used for this purpose http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9765695/why-cant-i-manually-submit-this-form and
[14:54:26] <cfurrow> oquidave: .submit() without a callback submits a form. .submit() with a callback defined adds a callback to the form submission that will run when the form is trying to be submitted. a form can be submitted via a .submit() call, or from a button press that submits the form.
[14:55:34] <LocusAsaf> if I want to continually make an ajax request until the server responds with a non-empty json response, is there a clean way to accomplish that?
[14:57:33] <cfurrow> you want to poll a server via ajax? maybe something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1406580/jquery-ajax-polling-for-json-response-handling-based-on-ajax-result-or-json-con
[14:57:54] <cfurrow> I assume there is a jquery polling lib out there, but I haven't had a need for one yet.
[14:58:00] <LocusAsaf> cfurrow: I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to client side scripting, should I not be using ajax?
[14:58:14] <cfurrow> no, that is exactly what you need to be doing
[14:58:31] <cfurrow> I just was clarifying what you were after.
[14:58:48] <LocusAsaf> alright I'll take a look at the article
[15:01:39] <LocusAsaf> what's xhr_data?
[15:01:48] <YamakasY> is it possible to "change" a formvalue using a ajax post ? I need to post a form with an #submit, check it and when it's not OK I need to resubmit it with #resubmit instead of #submit
[15:04:31] <oquidave> cfurrow: if i get your right, this is wrong code ...$("#customForm").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();(this).submit();});
[15:04:33] <cfurrow> LocusAsaf: xhr_data is XMLHTTPRequest
[15:04:49] <LocusAsaf> cool thanks
[15:05:28] <cfurrow> oquidave: it's odd, for sure. why stop the event from continuing (via e.preventDefault()) and then submit it anyway (this).submit()) ?
[15:08:18] <oquidave> cfurrow: am still very confused, but thanks the help. Hopefully i'll get to understand it better..afterall my code is working (for now)
[15:08:24] <cfurrow> oquidave: Use .submit(function(e){}) when you are altering the behavior of a form submit by validating, or something else. If inside that function(e){} you do validation, and the validation returns 'false', you should THEN call e.preventDefault() to prevent the form from submitting, and then you can show error messages, or whatever.
[15:09:04] <oquidave> cfurrow: much clearer
[15:09:12] <cfurrow> Hope it's helpful
[15:10:12] <hongpong4> i have a DOM element where something calls jquery to give it HTML style attribute height / width , how do i determine/ trace what called jquery to impose that direct style attribute? thanks
[15:12:00] <cfurrow> hongpong4: that's a bit of a mess. you could attempt to set a breakpoint in jquery's code (horrible idea, time consuming, etc). you could also add a jquery method hijacker to attempt to capture calls to $('something').style(), but that would also be a mess. i don't know of a clean/easy way to do it. there aren't any hooks like that that i know of.
[15:12:43] <cfurrow> hoisting jquery methods may be your only way, but even then you'd have to set breakpoints in order to get a stack trace, and try and determine the source.
[15:14:01] <hongpong4> thanks cfurrow . i tried using the Chrome devtools break on attribute change, and it brought me into the midst of jquery, perhaps some careful use of 'step into' that eludes me would help
[15:14:39] <cfurrow> hongpong4: perhaps. it may take some time, but you should get there eventually.
[15:19:47] <hongpong4> thanks cfurrow - i have to run off to work now but i appreciate it. anyone can PM me w any other tips tracing DOM attribute changes - i think this window will run out of buffer before i get back
[15:27:42] <josePHPagoda> Hello everyone!  So I'm working on someone elses code, trying to make some basic modifications
[15:28:36] <josePHPagoda> http://hastebin.com/picenoxuho.hs
[15:29:19] <josePHPagoda> that's the code I"m trying to change.  From what I understand, it looks like it's checking if "data-selected" is the element.  What I'm trying to do is make it check the contents of the selected attribute
[15:29:26] <josePHPagoda> how's the best way to go about that?
[15:29:33] <josePHPagoda> (I'm fairly new to jquery)
[15:35:09] <decx> josePHPagoda as a selector: $('[data-attribute="value"]') on an element if (el.data('attribute') === 'value')
[15:36:23] <josePHPagoda> decx: I understand the beginning, but not the el.data part
[15:36:35] <josePHPagoda> is that to check the element data?
[15:37:02] <decx> yes
[15:37:38] <josePHPagoda> so with the example I posted, what do I change?
[15:37:53] <josePHPagoda> i'm looking at it and your example
[15:37:56] <decx> you can extend that is
[15:38:08] <decx> .is([data-selected="whatever"])
[15:38:15] <josePHPagoda> oh?
[15:38:21] <josePHPagoda> and would that do both checks at the same time?
[15:38:33] <josePHPagoda> it would check the attribute and if it's equal to a certain value?
[15:39:23] <decx> yes, data-attributes land in a datalist relating to that element
[15:39:44] <josePHPagoda> ok
[15:39:46] <josePHPagoda> so let me try this
[15:39:48] <josePHPagoda> one second
[15:40:59] <decx> there are some caveats to that, as shown here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xe72j/
[15:41:31] <josePHPagoda> checked = ( $(z).is([selected='selected']) ) ? "checked='checked'" : "";
[15:41:34] <josePHPagoda> would something like that work?
[15:41:45] <decx> i have no idea what checked does elsewhere
[15:42:18] <decx> you missed a data-
[15:42:25] <decx> you need that when you check attributes
[15:42:59] <decx> there's a difference, it's subtle but the fiddle shows what happens
[15:43:49] <josePHPagoda> hmm, unsure how to use the fiddle...
[15:43:50] <josePHPagoda> :(
[15:43:54] <josePHPagoda> sorry for being such a noob
[15:44:26] <decx> if you start to use the console you'll ascend to halfnoob without any effort
[15:44:38] <josePHPagoda> lol
[15:44:54] <josePHPagoda> my ascension out of noobhood will hopefully be swift
[15:44:56] <decx> firebug or chrome tools have a console, that will output anything you want
[15:45:46] <josePHPagoda> yeah, I know that
[15:45:53] <josePHPagoda> i've done some super basic js stuff
[15:46:05] <josePHPagoda> but a lot of the innards get me
[15:48:14] <decx> afaik when your browser gets the page it creates a datalist for every element containing its data-attributes, you can access that with .data(). In the fiddle it shows that simply changing attr('data-attribute','value') doesn't update the datalist
[15:48:37] <josePHPagoda> let me give some more context
[15:48:44] <josePHPagoda> http://andreamariani.net/lab/zurbfoundation5-multiselect/
[15:49:31] <josePHPagoda> i'm using that, and it's working wonderfully, but instead of using <option data-selected> I want to use <option selected='selected'>
[15:49:49] <decx> why?
[15:50:05] <josePHPagoda> i've already got my framework outputting selected="selected"
[15:50:21] <decx> ah just selected
[15:50:41] <josePHPagoda> does that context help at all?
[15:50:44] <decx> nevermind then
[15:50:55] <decx> you can just do .is(':selected')
[15:51:01] <Winters> http://pastebin.com/BtKvaC44 --I would like to send a string to a web api, using jQuery. On the server side I'm using ASP.NET, C#. Am I sending the string data correctly to the api? Is there an easier way to send the string to the api using jQuery, or do I have to send the string as a key-value pair? How do I receive the string on the server side?
[15:51:52] <josePHPagoda> hmm, I'm curious as to how that would work
[15:53:06] <josePHPagoda> ah, it works
[15:53:09] <josePHPagoda> but now I'm wondering how...
[15:53:24] <shoky> Winters you're sending it correctly sure. what's not easy about that?  on the server side you will have it as a GET param called 'search'
[15:53:41] <Winters> aha
[15:53:51] <Winters> so, just string search as a param
[15:54:02] <shoky> a param called 'search'
[15:54:23] <decx> josePHPagoda is() just gives back true or false, and it accepts all the selectors that jquery can use, for option elements that includes :selected
[15:54:40] <Winters> shoky: but I have to declare it as get(string search) ?
[15:54:41] <josePHPagoda> ah
[15:54:42] <josePHPagoda> cool
[15:54:45] <josePHPagoda> i was not aware of that
[15:54:55] <shoky> Winters: i doubt it, but that's not a question for this channel
[15:55:44] <Winters> shoky: ok
[17:53:13] <YamakasY> what could be a reason that my ajax post does not stop in running the code from start to end ?
[17:54:57] <YamakasY> it finally turns my post into a get
[17:55:56] <YamakasY> so I get a very shor "success" and than it goes trough and runs through and goes back to the start of my page
[17:56:48] <LocusAsaf> can someone show me a simple example of the correct way to add rows/cells to a table?
[17:57:48] <LocusAsaf> I guess also I should add I've got a json object that I'm using to populate the new rows
[18:02:22] <LocusAsaf> I'm getting a warning from my IDE about improper jquery usage on the following selector, "$('#topsupplies > tbody')" does anyone know why?
[18:03:52] <tw2113> do they explain what they mean by improper?
[18:03:53] <shoky> LocusAsaf they probably want you to do $('#topsupplies').children('tbody') or smth
[18:03:53] <caleb_io> Not sure why it would be giving you a warning, seems fine.
[18:04:16] <tw2113> if it's phpstorm, probably "inefficient"
[18:04:18] <caleb_io> It could be blowing up on the child selector.
[18:11:40] <LocusAsaf> tw2113: it didn't explain, just gives a warning
[18:12:04] <LocusAsaf> thanks guys just curious
[18:19:51] <hugo_m> anyone here read secrets of the javascript ninja by john reiseg?
[18:20:01] <hugo_m> the creator of jquery
[18:20:06] <arschmitz> hugo_m: i have
[18:20:11] <hugo_m> cool
[18:20:19] <hugo_m> i just read the first two chpaters
[18:20:34] <hugo_m> but theres a question i have on a code sample
[18:20:42] <arschmitz> ok
[18:20:48] <hugo_m> the part where he talks about testing suites
[18:20:51] <hugo_m> in chapter 2
[18:21:06] <hugo_m> and its code that tests asynchronous code
[18:21:12] <arschmitz> ok i dont have the book in front of me but im pretty familier
[18:21:17] <hugo_m> ok
[18:21:21] <YamakasY> anyone an idea ?
[18:21:32] <hugo_m> let me paste the code on a paste site
[18:22:12] <arschmitz> ok
[18:22:31] <YamakasY> is it possible to let an ajax script die ?
[18:22:41] <YamakasY> so stop id
[18:22:43] <arschmitz> YamakasY: what do you mean let it die?
[18:22:44] <YamakasY> stop it
[18:22:59] <YamakasY> arschmitz: stop it where you want using die(); or so
[18:23:20] <hugo_m> http://pastie.org/9096555#
[18:23:55] <arschmitz> can you give some sort of example what your trying to do? under what conditions would you want to cancel a request?
[18:23:55] <hugo_m> what is the purpose of line 21-22?
[18:24:49] <hugo_m> i understand the purpose of having resume() in lines 46 and 54
[18:25:08] <hugo_m> but i don't know why he has that added if( !paused) resume(), inside runTest()
[18:26:41] <arschmitz> hugo_m: just a sec let me take a look
[18:26:52] <hugo_m> k thanks
[18:27:12] <YamakasY> arschmitz: just let some script stop in the success or error
[18:27:12] <shoky> hugo_m to run the next test, no?
[18:27:18] <YamakasY> or runs through now :S
[18:27:52] <hugo_m> shaky, well after looking at the code for like half an hour or so
[18:27:57] <arschmitz> YamakasY: well there are success and error callbacks
[18:28:03] <arschmitz> you should just use those
[18:28:21] <arschmitz> hugo_m: yes as shoky said it runs the next test in the array
[18:28:30] <YamakasY> arschmitz: I use them but I see them for less than a second and it goes back to the index and load that
[18:28:31] <arschmitz> though the extra if i cant see the need for
[18:28:32] <shoky> hugo_m: line 20  executes the current test. then it calls resume again to schedule the next runTest
[18:28:38] <arschmitz> shift cant effect paused
[18:28:47] <shoky> it's not just shift
[18:28:50] <arschmitz> and pasued was checked on line 19
[18:28:52] <shoky> it runs the function
[18:28:56] <shoky> ()()
[18:29:15] <shoky> and the functions here do call pause
[18:29:20] <shoky> well one of them
[18:29:22] <arschmitz> shoky: oh your right
[18:29:25] <shoky> ah no both
[18:29:33] <arschmitz> because those test there are testing the test suit it self
[18:30:14] <arschmitz> so it runs the next test assuming its not paused
[18:31:22] <hugo_m> well
[18:31:41] <hugo_m> I've tried to think about the process how the code would execute on the computer in my head
[18:31:51] <hugo_m> and when the second test is queued
[18:32:01] <hugo_m> it calls runTest
[18:32:11] <hugo_m> every time a test is queued, runTest is called
[18:33:25] <shoky> right
[18:33:34] <hugo_m> so i thought why add that check if !paused, resume, it would be superfluous i thought
[18:33:37] <arschmitz> hugo_m: if its been paused it wont run
[18:34:15] <shoky> yup
[18:34:19] <arschmitz> so in the tests they call pause on the first line
[18:34:54] <arschmitz> so when the second test is queued paused is true
[18:34:55] <shoky> hugo_m: runTest is called 1st time -> does queue.shift()() which calls the test function -> does pause() and setTimeout
[18:35:04] <hugo_m> aha i think thats the answer i was looking for arschmitz
[18:35:35] <arschmitz> so then when resume is called it resets paused to false and runs the next test
[18:37:04] <hugo_m> yea i see now
[18:37:06] <hugo_m> thanks guys
[18:37:24] <arschmitz> hugo_m: no problem its a great book i think
[18:37:29] <hugo_m> it is yea
[18:37:48] <hugo_m> can't go wrong with creator of jquery as an author
[18:38:03] <hugo_m> ive tried to read the definitive guide
[18:38:10] <hugo_m> only got through the first 10 chapters though
[18:38:12] <hugo_m> its huge
[18:39:09] <hugo_m> its cool that i can come online on freenode
[18:39:25] <hugo_m> and find people who read the book or understand the code
[18:40:02] <hugo_m> the book is also pretty short which i like
[18:40:08] <hugo_m> and the font is a lot bigger
[18:40:18] <hugo_m> so its readable, and takes less time to read
[18:47:25] <gtek1k> does anyone use or recommend http://demos.jquerymobile.com/ ? Also what is a best plugin/way to implement touch functionality on tablet/mobile etc
[18:49:03] <arschmitz> gtek1k: i use and recommend it but i might be biased im one of the developers :)
[18:49:21] <gtek1k> well I was going to just add a touch plugin but came across it
[18:49:30] <gtek1k> so wondering if I need to step my game up and learn/use it
[18:49:56] <arschmitz> gtek1k: depends what your trying to do with it big difference between jqm and a simple plugin for using touch events
[18:50:19] <gtek1k> how might I know when its good to use jquery mobile
[18:50:32] <gtek1k> seems more related to form elements or adding the ajax layer
[18:50:34] <arschmitz> its going to be specific to your projects needs
[18:50:43] <gtek1k> well I do many projects lol
[18:50:46] <arschmitz> gtek1k: its a full mobile framework
[18:50:57] <gtek1k> mostly just wordpress informative based sites with good design
[18:51:08] <arschmitz> gtek1k: well you would need to decide for each one if its needed and makes sense like any other tool
[18:51:38] <gtek1k> what would you say is the main benefit or best case to use it
[18:52:21] <arschmitz> well it handles touch event abstraction, has mobile optimized widgets, and a navigation framework using ajax and page transitions
[18:52:30] <arschmitz> as well as the css framework part of it
[18:53:13] <gtek1k> hmm
[18:53:22] <gtek1k> touch event abstraction sounds cool
[18:53:25] <arschmitz> so if those are things you need in your project or are trying to make a mobile specific version of something
[18:53:38] <gtek1k> and thats cool you're one of the devs, thx for chattin arschmitz
[18:53:40] <arschmitz> gtek1k: you can also use the download builder to pull out just the parts you need
[18:54:04] <arschmitz> so if all you want is the touch stuff you can pull out just that
[18:54:12] <gtek1k> well as good as responsive is, im learning more that separate mobile site has the benefit of each only loading content they are using
[18:54:31] <gtek1k> some sites I notice have large images, where on mobile they are sized down... smarter to load the smaller version?
[18:54:33] <arschmitz> gtek1k: well jquery mobile is responsive out of the box also
[18:54:54] <arschmitz> its not just for mobile it can be used anywhere
[18:55:16] <arschmitz> gtek1k: there are many plugins and polyfils for responsive image loading
[18:58:01] <gtek1k> man now my head is spinning
[18:58:18] <arschmitz> gtek1k: ha ha
[18:58:19] <gtek1k> so if I was using WP jquery mobile is not ideal or just as useable?
[18:58:44] <arschmitz> gtek1k: there are lots of wordpess themes using jquery mobile
[18:58:58] <arschmitz> so they work just fine together
[19:01:18] <gtek1k> any samples you know of ?
[19:01:47] <arschmitz> gtek1k: http://www.mobilizetoday.com/freebies/jqmobile
[19:05:06] <gtek1k> thanks for the info/chat arschmitz
[19:05:13] <gtek1k> are you available for any freelance work?
[19:05:28] <arschmitz> gtek1k: no problem happy to help
[19:06:00] <arschmitz> gtek1k: im afraid not i no longer take side work
[19:06:09] <gtek1k> you work for jquery or?
[19:06:32] <arschmitz> im an independant contractor but the jquery foundation has contracted all of my time
[19:06:45] <gtek1k> lol sounds good man congrats
[19:06:55] <gtek1k> what other languages you write/enjoy if I can ask
[19:06:57] <arschmitz> gtek1k: thanks its actually my dream job :)
[19:07:12] <arschmitz> gtek1k: i do mostly front end so mostly javascript
[19:07:28] <gtek1k> what if you need to use a DB
[19:07:31] <arschmitz> but i also do small amounts of php i wrote c++ for about 10 years
[19:07:39] <gtek1k> u like node.js ?
[19:07:42] <arschmitz> for DB i generally just use mysql
[19:07:49] <arschmitz> gtek1k: yes i use node a lot
[19:08:03] <arschmitz> gtek1k: im helping someone develop a bug tracker in node
[19:08:09] <gtek1k> pretty cool implementation I worked a little on with node.js and backbone
[19:08:15] <gtek1k> but for me WP is much easier
[19:08:27] <arschmitz> gtek1k: all the jquery websites are wordpress
[19:08:37] <gtek1k> lol go figure
[19:08:46] <gtek1k> wow ur right
[19:08:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[19:08:54] <gtek1k> and I hear WP now has a built in JS API
[19:09:00] <gtek1k> I have not used it yet
[19:09:05] <arschmitz> ours is not a normal setup
[19:09:12] <gtek1k> but have a project coming up need dynamic updates through web sockets
[19:09:22] <arschmitz> its actually all managed through github not through any sort of admin area
[19:09:48] <arschmitz> gtek1k: socket.io works well i used it recently
[19:09:48] <gtek1k> hmm not sure I understand exactly
[19:10:09] <arschmitz> gtek1k: we dont use the wordpress admin area to add change or remove content
[19:10:18] <arschmitz> its all managed with xml in a github repo
[19:10:28] <gtek1k> so a custom admin interface?
[19:10:31] <gtek1k> that generates XML
[19:10:34] <gtek1k> or they just wirte in XML
[19:10:42] <arschmitz> just write xml
[19:10:45] <gtek1k> lol
[19:10:49] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com

[19:15:18] <arschmitz> lol yea
[19:15:32] <gtek1k> thinking about integrating with stripe.com
[19:15:38] <gtek1k> seems pretty easy
[19:15:56] <arschmitz> we use them
[20:09:52] <LocusAsaf> how I do properly iterate over this object http://bpaste.net/show/WL2xAJlfXEgLcWM5aKT2/ with each?
[20:11:03] <acidjazz> LocusAsaf: uh
[20:11:26] <acidjazz> LocusAsaf: i could literally paste you the jquery each page
[20:11:44] <LocusAsaf> what?
[20:12:29] <LocusAsaf> I'm not sure what you mean
[20:16:37] <wa5ted> hey guys
[20:16:43] <wa5ted> is there anyway in css
[20:16:51] <wa5ted> where if i resize a window
[20:17:07] <wa5ted> i can set whcih part of a background image the resize should be focused around
[20:21:17] <LocusAsaf> acidjazz: can you clarify please?
[20:50:57] <xorl> I'm going to preface this with, I suck with javascript and ask away anyways, I have a form with a select box that I want to populate when the value of another select box is changed, I found an example here
[20:51:00] <xorl> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19036821/jquery-ajax-using-ajax-to-populate-select-boxes-in-a-dynamic-form
[20:51:09] <xorl> Is there a better way to do that without having to create the table of data?
[20:52:36] <xorl> I have a page that generates an array of zones from ec2 and I want it to populate the box based on some value, i've already coded the page on the backend to support this just, javascript is a crutch
[21:17:20] <shoky> xorl yeah you don't need to create a table if what you want is to populate a selectbox
[21:17:30] <xorl> shoky yeah I found a good tutorial
[21:17:52] <shoky> oks
[21:17:58] <xorl> shoky showed me how simple it actually was to just select, getjson from the output I already created, parse it and do a for loop over it to create the new select boxes
[21:17:59] <xorl> :D
[21:18:14] <shoky> yep that should do it ;p
[21:19:42] <xorl> at least I understand what it meant
[21:19:45] <xorl> I suck with JS haha
[21:26:51] <wa5ted> shoky: how would i convert vertical scrolling into horizontal scrolling. Eg. scrolling down on a track pad or using a mouse wheel will make a div scroll to the right
[21:41:34] <shoky> wa5ted listen for scroll events and change the scrollTop/scrollLeft properties, i guess
[21:41:49] <wa5ted> yeah
[21:41:55] <shoky> though..
[21:41:56] <wa5ted> what if my overflow-y: hideen
[21:41:59] <wa5ted> hidden
[21:42:05] <wa5ted> though that shouldnt make a difference
[21:42:11] <shoky> then there is no vertical scrolling to convert ;P
[21:44:48] <wa5ted> well icant have that vertical bar scowing
[21:44:54] <wa5ted> showing
[21:45:02] <wa5ted> is there anywayi can detect scroll amount
[21:45:19] <wa5ted> i wanna kinda do something like apple.com mac pro site
[21:45:29] <wa5ted> where you swipe and it changes
[21:45:35] <wa5ted> or you scroll and it changes
[21:52:48] <wa5ted> shoky: ^any ideas
[21:56:27] <shoky> donno what site you're talking about
[21:56:41] <shoky> and i donno shit about swipes
[22:02:06] <shoky> wa5ted but check this crap out :P http://jsfiddle.net/EUEur/2/show/light/#a
[22:02:38] <wa5ted> nice
[22:02:46] <wa5ted> but i dont want it to verticla scroll
[22:02:49] <wa5ted> just horozontal
[22:03:00] <wa5ted> convert vertical scrolling to horizontal scrolling
[22:03:33] <shoky> that's what it's doing, or trying to
[22:03:49] <shoky> at least in chrome
[22:04:07] <shoky> but if you start at the top of the page, you can't scroll up
[22:04:15] <shoky> i.e. you can't scroll left
[22:04:25] <shoky> that's what the #a is for :(
[22:09:31] <wa5ted> true
[22:10:09] <wa5ted> shoky: is it possible to soothly change between background images using transistion
[22:10:14] <wa5ted> css property
[22:16:17] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/5zKS3/3/    <-- how do i send the html in the textarea as html to the div with id=cool or id=coolname ?
[22:16:47] <tables> basically, i wanna send html in textarea as html to a div
[22:23:34] <teitokle_> test join
[22:28:16] <solta> hello everyone
[22:29:37] <solta> i'm having a problem with tjqgrid events. i did a web search and there was no relevant results to my problem. the problem is that the afterSubmitCell event is raised after i enter edit mode , and not as the name suggests, after cell value is submitted.
[22:30:08] <solta> anyone else here has had such an experience ?>
[23:13:39] <lolmaus> I would like to share a jQuery plugin written in CoffeeScript. Not sharing a JS version would be a bad practice. But  version controlling an auto-generated file is also considered to be a bad practice! What do i do?
[23:29:12] <fattest> how do i change the colors for my graph? http://jsbin.com/uzosiq/258/embed?javascript,live the documentation shows "barColors", but i can't figure it out
