[00:00:02] <Cork> Puck6633: ya, though you have to tetter android through the adb command
[00:00:08] <Cork> its quite a hassle
[00:00:23] <Cork> but ya, it is possible
[00:00:37] <Cork> (and you have to enable remote debugging in the desktop browser)
[00:01:26] <Puck6633> Interesting. With Chrome and Android it's apparently not that difficult.
[00:01:28] <Puck6633> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging
[00:02:03] <Puck6633> It doesn't even seem to require the Android SDK. Probably still requires the phone's USB driver, but I think that's all.
[00:06:44] <mirko> hello - i'm looking for a way to select elements which have classes X, Y, Z - even if not explicitly declared but inherited from a parent
[00:06:50] <mirko> example: http://pastebin.com/8DwmFcPL
[00:07:33] <Puck6633> mirko: Shouldn't it just be the CSS selecter '.classname *'?
[00:08:15] <mirko> Puck6633: if i go for "content" i also get the div only having "content"
[00:08:25] <Puck6633> Or rather, '.classname, .classname *'
[00:08:38] <Puck6633> Since the first selector won't select elements that actually have the class.
[00:08:44] <mirko> That's a union then
[00:09:10] <mirko> hmm, what does the asterisk do?
[00:09:54] <emocakes> stuff
[00:10:08] <mirko> emocakes: great!
[00:10:11] <emocakes> !!
[00:10:12] <Puck6633> Selects any element. The space selects children so '.classname *' selects any child of an element that has the class 'classname' (which means the element would have inherited the class properties)
[00:11:36] <mirko> Puck6633: sorry, but i don' get that applied on my problem/usecase.. i want all the 'saved' ones which have also declared 'content' or a parent has
[00:13:22] <Guest8051> WHAT
[00:13:49] <toast_man> i just want to be toast man
[00:14:45] <Puck6633> mirko: The same principle applies, you just want to select saved instead of any element: '.content.saved, .content .saved'
[00:31:04] <mirko> Puck6633: thanks!
[00:47:33] <toast_man> hey
[00:47:39] <toast_man> i wrote a simple JSONField script
[00:47:45] <toast_man> should i release it or something?
[00:47:49] <toast_man> do people need stuff like that?
[00:48:42] <vaibhav10jain> I need to validate some form fields which are dynamically created. Tried using bootstrap formvalidation. But stuck on this issue http://goo.gl/gQ8gJ8 . Can someone please help me.
[00:50:15] <vaibhav10jain> Is their any plugin to validate form field by Id. Which supports regex????
[00:51:14] <anli> I added a reference to jquery in a nunit test like this: /// <reference path="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js" />
[00:51:21] <anli> I still get $ as undefined
[00:51:57] <anli> Sorry, QUnit
[02:03:35] <Larado> hi, i got this form done in BS, and want to make it look a bit prettier, how can i do that, id like the all the elements to come together perhaps, i e close to each other or connected in some way http://i.imgur.com/JxS0IYH.png
[02:24:39] <Cork> Larado: look into the classes and ids of the form and write a different theme
[02:24:52] <Cork> not really a question for jquery though => #css
[02:25:46] <boaseter> Hi, when using $.ajaxSetup with headers-option for basic authentication, i see that the request is done with two request, an options-request and then the real request... is it possible to execute those in one roundtrip, or am i missing someting fundemental by asking that?
[02:26:48] <Larado> Cork ok sort of got the look i was looking for http://jsfiddle.net/xmw1gwk4/1/
[02:27:17] <Larado> can you tell me though how i can change the text in the input ie if .NET is select change the .COM on the button to show .NET
[02:27:19] <Cork> boaseter: if you see an option request it means your doing a cross domain post
[02:27:34] <Cork> boaseter: and no you can't do them as one call, the option call is mandatory for xss
[02:27:41] <boaseter> Cork: correct
[02:27:46] <boaseter> ok, clear, thanks
[02:28:34] <Cork> boaseter: the remote server has to answer the option call so the browser knows the server can handle cross domain post without security breaches
[02:29:37] <vfpt> Is anyone familiar with "unspecified error"s when trying to append a link (stylesheet) element to a document's head on IE8?
[02:29:56] <Cork> Larado: you would have to bind click actions on the li elements
[02:30:15] <vfpt> I just spent a long time trying to reproduce this on jsfiddle with no luck, maybe I needed to manually set the entire document structure... When I gave up the fiddle itself was showing up garbled
[02:30:45] <vfpt> The unspecified error comes from buildFragment
[02:31:05] <boaseter> Cork: ok, i just hoped there was a way to do a one-time handshake-request, then for all succeeding calls just a normal request...
[02:31:31] <Cork> boaseter: similar calls should be cached
[02:31:44] <Cork> but ya, it will be one call for each set of params
[02:32:10] <Cork> but ya, its better to avoid cors as much as possible
[02:33:17] <Cork> vfpt: haven't fiddled with ie8 for a long time, and even then never injected <link rel="stylesheet">
[02:33:25] <Cork> might be ie doesn't support it
[02:33:38] <vfpt> According to my research it should
[02:33:42] <Cork> (this isn't something you should do anyway)
[02:33:53] <vfpt> Microsoft says createStylesheet only works for up to 31 stylesheets, and then recommends injecting the element
[02:34:02] <vfpt> How would you do this then?
[02:34:12] <Cork> do what?
[02:34:29] <Cork> you've only said what solution you've tried to implement
[02:34:30] <vfpt> Adding a stylesheet to a programmatically created window without a document source
[02:34:35] <Cork> not what you're trying to do
[02:34:54] <boaseter> Cork: the reason for cors is that i use one api for multiple applications, the api and the applications do have the same top-domain, however.
[02:35:24] <vfpt> var win = window.open(); addStylesheetTo(win, stylesheeturl); ?
[02:35:35] <vfpt> (Needless to say this works flawlessly on firefox and chrome)
[02:35:38] <Cork> vfpt: again, what are you trying to do?
[02:36:02] <vfpt> I need to copy stylesheets from the current document into the new window. I don't know how to be any more specific?
[02:36:26] <Cork> ah, sorry i missed the last part of the last line >_<'
[02:36:37] <Larado> Cork so i got this now, but obviously the Caret sign in the button would get replaced, how can i prevent that http://jsfiddle.net/xmw1gwk4/2/
[02:36:50] <Larado> or if you can optimize this a bit from what i got aswell
[02:37:57] <Cork> vfpt: so your checking if document.createStyleSheet exist and uses it for ie?
[02:38:39] <vfpt> I did not try that yet, since it seemed to me the jquery method should work for every browser and the 31 stylesheets limit worries me a little
[02:38:47] <vfpt> This is a generic function that should work for any document
[02:38:58] <vfpt> I cannot be sure that all of them have 31 or fewer stylesheets
[02:39:15] <vfpt> And unfortunately I can't ditch IE8 either; not my decision
[02:39:23] <Cork> Larado: if you don't have an api for changing the text in the button use http://jsfiddle.net/xmw1gwk4/3/
[02:40:36] <Cork> vfpt: from a few quick googles nope
[02:40:45] <Cork> append <link> works in ie9+
[02:42:20] <vfpt> I guess I'll try createStylesheet then... Not cool, microsoft
[02:42:35] <Cork> vfpt: your using a none standard browser
[02:42:37] <Cork> what do you expect
[02:42:49] <Cork> there is a reason why most ppl has dropped support for ie8 :)
[02:43:18] <Cork> vfpt: should be ease enough to do
[02:43:29] <Cork> you could even write a tiny jquery plugin for it
[02:43:56] <vfpt> I can't change corporate policy. Yeah it won't be a problem as long as no document has 32 stylesheets or more
[02:44:17] <vfpt> If someone complains I guess I'll use it to push for IE11
[02:44:26] <Cork> ie10+ is enough
[02:44:33] <Cork> ie9 if you have to
[02:45:02] <Cork> also ie8 never was much of a blocker
[02:45:19] <Cork> well at least not with xp gone
[02:45:40] <vfpt> IE8 is the default on windows 7, though, right?
[02:45:44] * kansi says hi
[02:45:58] <Cork> vfpt: it was for a little while at the beginning
[02:46:24] <Cork> but i think that was pre release
[02:46:53] <Cork> ya, win7 beta used ie8
[02:47:07] <Cork> oh wait, no it was in release
[02:47:30] <Cork> damn... could have sworn win7 had ie9...
[02:48:17] <miCSu> hm, I thought so too
[02:48:23] <Cork> well that just stands to show why the browser shouldn't be part of the os...
[02:51:20] <Larado> Cork ok, i can do it that way, thought there would have been a cooler way to change the text, anyway i think it looks much better and more closer to what i was looking for from the original image
[02:52:20] <Cork> Larado: look into the api for the dropdown menu you use now
[02:52:32] <Cork> Larado: the problem is if you modify the text you will remove the child element
[02:52:48] <Cork> and you can't do anything about that without an api, as there isn't anything holding the text
[02:52:55] <Larado> yep
[02:53:11] <Larado> ill check it out, got quite far so im happy
[02:53:48] <Larado> need to figure out why there is a space between WWW and the textbox and also make the width of the TLD lager and should be good to go
[02:54:32] <kansi> i am trying to build a jquery plugin which has an internal "_state" variable (which has default value) to store some data in the plugin. now I initiate the plugin on new element and then remove the element after i am done, but when i try to initiate the plugin again on new element the internal variable seems carry forward the values it had in its last
[02:54:32] <kansi> instance of the plugin, how can i get to reset "_state" to default in its new instance.
[02:54:42] <Cork> Larado: space? where?
[02:55:11] <DRSK> I've set up a class to *stop* transitions in CSS and I'm adding this class to my element, however it seems to remove the class too fast for it to actually "mean something" so the question is how I could force a redraw/paint or something inbetween adding/removing the class so that I can skip a transition when desired?
[02:55:20] <Larado> there is a space between the WWW button and the input box, but dont worry i need to sort out what of BS is causing it
[02:55:28] <Larado> just need to plat around with the BS controls
[02:55:29] <Cork> kansi: the scope of the plugin is for the life time of the page, not per element
[02:55:31] <Larado> i got it
[02:55:46] <Cork> kansi: if you want to store state per element use .data()
[02:56:04] <kansi> ok
[02:56:17] <Cork> DRSK: height()
[02:56:23] <DRSK> on anything?
[02:56:30] <Cork> on the element with the animation
[02:56:44] <DRSK> All right, I was trying outerHeight but to no effect, thanks I'll try height
[02:56:52] <Cork> basically you need to trigger a reflow of the page
[02:57:07] <Cork> and asking for element calculation is the simplest way of doing that
[02:57:36] <Cork> DRSK: outerHeight should work too
[02:57:49] <DRSK> hmm.
[03:03:04] <DRSK> Cork » for some reason it's still *firing* to fast so basically it's running the transition anyway. Any ideas?
[03:03:21] <Cork> ?demo
[03:03:21] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:04:05] <DRSK> Cork » would it be ok to pm the url? It's not finished etc
[03:04:29] <Cork> i don't have the time to dissect a full page
[03:04:33] <DRSK> I guess I could make an example using the code I have though
[03:09:31] <DRSK> Cork » umm yeah this went sideways but seems to be "working" :: http://jsfiddle.net/6th28qyg/ the line I'm having issues with is 179 in the js
[03:10:18] <DRSK> basically what I am trying to do is to have it "continous" rather than jumping back to slide 0
[03:18:29] <Mark_2> can anyone pelase take a look at my website and tell me why the ‘unslider.js’ plugin isn’t working properly? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/jquery
[03:20:31] <Cork> DRSK: are you telling me to parse the minified script?
[03:20:59] <DRSK> Cork » that's just Modernizr below it, sorry. Couldn't get it in as a resource
[03:21:22] <Cork> ah the real code is lower down
[03:21:54] <DRSK> Yeah sorry; couldn't find an URI to a stripped down modernizr custom build so I just put it up there. My bad :/
[03:21:57] <Cork> DRSK: btw you've missed code for none webkit browsers
[03:22:27] <DRSK> Cork » in the CSS you mean?
[03:22:32] <Cork> yes
[03:22:44] <DRSK> Ah yeah, I haven't prefixed it yet
[03:22:48] <[Non]> hi i have a code under the document ready but it doesnt work even if with settimeout, but its working on console
[03:23:29] <kansi> /close
[03:23:32] <[Non]> what does that mean?
[03:24:02] <Cork> DRSK: the change needs to be around line 93-95
[03:24:13] <Cork> setting it as you modify a variable won't do anything
[03:24:40] <visof> hi
[03:24:46] <Cork> so from where you're running you need to do it around this.transition();
[03:24:47] <visof> i'm trying to show gif while AJAX request complete then hide it, what i did is http://pastie.org/9860239 , the problem is, the first click on the link don't give me gif, but the second click on the same page give me the loading gif
[03:25:02] <visof> i can't really figure it out, can anybody help me?
[03:25:22] <Cork> ?past @ [Non]
[03:25:26] <Cork> ?paste @ [Non]
[03:25:27] <b-ot> [Non]: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:26:12] <DRSK> Cork » oh I just had that piece of code to set it initially on load because I'm randomizing the currentSlide at init so I'd want it to be *transitioned' there as well. But the part I'm not getting is why the .height() at line 179 isn't triggering a reflow so that the removeClass works as intended
[03:26:16] <Cork> visof: you mean you want to show it UNTIL complete?
[03:26:22] <Cork> not on complete?
[03:26:41] <visof> Cork: yeah, it's working but not for the first click
[03:26:56] <Cork> DRSK: it does, but you haven't changed the style value yet
[03:27:02] <Cork> DRSK: so it doesn't do anything
[03:27:10] <Cork> after that you then remove the class again
[03:27:19] <Cork> and then something reads the variable and do the change
[03:27:34] <visof> Cork: .show() do
[03:27:48] <visof> i pasted the whole code i'm using
[03:27:54] <DRSK> Cork » so what if I were to have the removeClass in the function transition? Perhaps in the transitionEnd thing?
[03:28:05] <Cork> visof: yes, and the code is fine, it just doesn't match what you asked for
[03:28:15] <visof> Cork: so what is missing?
[03:28:29] <Cork> visof: if you want to do what the code displays it should work find
[03:28:41] <Cork> if you want something different to happen, you would have to explain it
[03:29:22] <[Non]> Cork: i want to paste it but its working on logged in user only
[03:29:25] <Cork> *it should work fine
[03:29:46] <Cork> [Non]: make an example of the problem
[03:29:50] <[Non]> and in that file every code is working beside this.. do you think maybe i can make this function and call function?
[03:29:50] <Cork> we can't mind read
[03:29:53] <visof> Cork: what i want exactly is, i should view loading gif till request complete
[03:29:53] <[Non]> okay
[03:30:12] <Cork> visof: and that is what the pb does
[03:30:27] <visof> Cork: what do you mean?
[03:30:33] <Cork> ...
[03:30:49] <Cork> http://pastie.org/9860239 <-- does that
[03:31:25] <visof> Cork: my page has some links when press first link i don't get loading gif, when this complete and press another in the same page, i got loading gif
[03:31:31] <visof> why the first don't work
[03:31:34] <visof> ?
[03:31:41] <visof> that's the problem i can't understand
[03:33:15] <[Non]> http://jsbin.com/dowivanoqe/1/edit?html,js,output
[03:33:17] <[Non]> i think thats?
[03:39:43] <[Non]> Cork - Could you look at it?
[03:40:14] <Cork> [Non]: your doing cross document access
[03:40:22] <Cork> ready only checks the current document
[03:40:49] <Cork> [Non]: also are you sure your allowed to actually access the parent document?
[03:43:06] <[Non]> hmm
[03:43:18] <[Non]> if i wont use parent, will code work?
[03:44:10] <[Non]> no its still not working..
[03:44:23] <[Non]> lets say; i want to get width of iframe, but i cant do it without parent
[03:46:28] <Cork> [Non]: http://jsfiddle.net/tj2u9kzc/
[03:46:36] <Cork> works fine here
[03:47:09] <Cork> (one page load it waits for 2 sec, then loads the html that takes 5 sec to get)
[03:49:27] <[Non]> umm
[03:49:40] <[Non]> okay it works now i get the idea
[03:49:47] <[Non]> thanks!
[03:50:04] <[Non]> can i ask you one more question(i not write any code, just curious the logic)
[03:50:22] <Cork> you just did :)
[03:50:27] <Cork> (don't ask to ask)
[03:50:34] <[Non]> lets say i want to give padding and this is depends to button number
[03:50:51] <[Non]> i mean if i have 2 .scButton class, then give padding:10
[03:51:15] <Cork> so all of them should have padding: 10?
[03:51:20] <Cork> or just the second one?
[03:51:23] <[Non]> all of them
[03:51:30] <Cork> css can't help you there
[03:51:47] <[Non]> if ($(".scButton").eq(2)) , is that right to start?
[03:51:59] <Cork> the best you could do was to add a class to body on page load
[03:52:09] <Cork> and have a small js script add the correct class
[03:52:36] <Cork> $('body').addClass('button-count' + $('.scButton').length);
[03:52:52] <visof> Cork: can you help me to find out what's going on?
[03:53:42] <Cork> opps sent the link to the wrong nick >_<'
[03:53:59] <Cork> visof: this was meant for you http://jsfiddle.net/tj2u9kzc/
[03:54:00] <[Non]> =))
[03:56:01] <DRSK> Cork » I managed to get it working! Thank you for your input; I failed to understand I wasn't doing anything hence the added class didn't have an effect.
[03:56:14] <Cork> :)
[03:56:18] <DRSK> I got this though: this.$navPrev.on( 'click', $.proxy( this.navigate, this, 'prev' ) ); and I was wondering if I should be using bind instead?
[03:56:38] <Cork> DRSK: depends on what browsers you need to support
[03:56:47] <DRSK> "modern" above IE9
[03:56:56] <[Non]> hmm.
[03:57:12] <[Non]> i will give a shot
[03:57:13] <Cork> DRSK: then it is up to you
[03:57:43] <Cork> prosy isn't super performant, but i don't think the code needs to be
[03:57:47] <Cork> so either way work
[03:58:06] <DRSK> Cork » I basically tried making use of the data in .bind such as .bind( 'click', { direction: 'prev' }, self.navigate ) but for some reason everything else inside navigate was "outside" the scope so e.g. this.currentSlide was undefined (I'm guessing that's the "this" in the proxy call)
[03:58:45] <Cork> you're binding 'click' as this
[03:59:16] <Cork> if you want to forward the local this, you want .bind(this, 'click', { direction: 'prev' }, self.navigate)
[03:59:26] <DRSK> ooohh
[03:59:43] <Cork> though not sure why you want to forward 'click'
[03:59:57] <Cork> a better option is prob to use the data option for on/bind
[04:00:16] <DRSK> Men either I thought I was sending the local thing so that I could access its vars
[04:01:26] <Cork> DRSK: i think you've mixed up what bind in jquery and bind in native js does
[04:01:31] <Cork> those are two different things
[04:02:22] <DRSK> So you mean the better option would be to do $el.on(this, 'click', { dir: 'prev' }, self.navigate ); ? Or wait hang on not following entirely, what did you mean when you said use the data option for on/bind ?
[04:02:22] <Cork> and i'm not sure which one you're actually trying to use...
[04:02:32] <Cork> no
[04:02:47] <Cork> if you want navigate to have a reference to self as this
[04:02:52] <Cork> you have to bind that reference
[04:03:10] <Cork> alternatively you can have .on forward the reference (what i usually do)
[04:03:23] <Cork> but then you can't use this inside the function as a reference to the instance
[04:03:35] <Cork> you have to use event.data.self instead
[04:03:38] <Cork> (as an example)
[04:04:15] <DRSK> Hm almost following you, so you'd do something like $el.on('click', { self: this, ?
[04:04:34] <Cork> this.$navPrev.on('click', $.proxy(this.navigate, this, 'prev')) becomes this.$navPrev.on('click', this.navigate, { self: this, direction: 'prev' })
[04:04:35] <DRSK> sorry I am a bit lost ^^
[04:05:06] <Cork> and in navigate you do function(event) { event.data.self.instanceMethod(event.data.direction); }
[04:05:09] <DRSK> Ah then I access "self" in navigate
[04:05:36] <Cork> DRSK: but note this means this will be the element, not the instance
[04:05:46] <Cork> you would have to forward that too
[04:05:49] <DRSK> Right, gotcha on that point at least :P
[04:06:15] <Cork> this is how i prefer to do it, as it keeps the event handler working as you normally expect them to
[04:06:47] <DRSK> Should I perhaps not use 2 .on but one instead and have it decide if it's next or prev based on the clicked el?
[04:07:03] <Cork> ya
[04:07:20] <Cork> it's easy enough to do
[04:07:33] <DRSK> Thanks, I'll try that instead! Thanks for your input as always Cork - much appreciated.
[04:10:28] <axscode> hi guys, how can i check if a dynamic element has been added to body?  like if $(body).hasClass('runOnThisPage') { var t=setInterval(function(){ CHECK_ELEMENT_IF_HAS_BEEN_ADDED_TO_BODY  },500)};
[04:10:47] <Cork> axscode: you can't cross browsers
[04:11:00] <Cork> had the code that adds the element notify you instead
[04:11:25] <axscode> hmmm nope, it is added by a different script that i cannot modify.
[04:11:37] <axscode> is there other solution?
[04:11:38] <Cork> in the future you can use mutationobservers, but they aren't cross browser yet
[04:12:05] <Cork> axscode: you might be able to wrap the call that adds the element and have it notify you
[04:12:12] <Cork> is the page using jquery?
[04:12:15] <Cork> sorry
[04:12:25] <Cork> is the script using jquery?
[04:12:33] <axscode> like i have to check every  half seconds if the element appeared or something..
[04:12:39] <Cork> no
[04:12:46] <Cork> you should never do that
[04:13:08] <visof> Cork: there is no result shown http://jsfiddle.net/tj2u9kzc/
[04:13:09] <Cork> firstly is this for your own page or browser scripting?
[04:13:10] <axscode> oh my.. any solution?
[04:13:32] <visof> works
[04:13:44] <axscode> my own page, but i cannot modified the one that adds <audio> to the body
[04:13:59] <Cork> axscode: is the script using jquery to modify the page?
[04:14:09] <axscode> yes yes
[04:14:18] <axscode> but i dont know how to trace.
[04:14:20] <Cork> you know if it uses .html or append ?
[04:14:40] <Cork> or before, after or...
[04:14:45] <axscode> hmm... im not sure really..
[04:14:56] <Cork> if you know what function it calls you can replace that function with a wrapper
[04:15:05] <Cork> and that way get a hook into the code
[04:15:31] <trini7y> i am trying to hide and show this <div> http://jsfiddle.net/aoamr02r/ but it will be hidden when ready
[04:15:47] <axscode> ok how to put hook into the code?
[04:16:36] <trini7y> http://jsfiddle.net/aoamr02r/2/ thats is the new link
[04:17:19] <Cork> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/a5khuhek/
[04:17:27] <axscode> ty hecking
[04:18:00] <Cork> axscode: a better option is to get the script auther to add a hook/callback for you to use
[04:18:33] <Cork> axscode: but this is a less terrible then setInterval solution if nothing else works
[04:18:43] <trini7y>  i am trying to hide and show this <div> http://jsfiddle.net/aoamr02r/2/ but it will be hidden when ready
[04:19:07] <Cork> trini7y: you already asked 3 mins ago you don't need to repeat your self THAT often
[04:19:38] <kqr> hey! if I'm curious about which arguments jquery pass to a handler function tied to a particular event, where do I look that up?
[04:19:42] <Cork> trini7y: toggle isn't supported anymore
[04:19:55] <Cork> trini7y: it was removed in 1.9
[04:20:09] <trini7y> ok thanks
[04:20:12] <axscode> audioVisualizer.appendTo($previewWrapper).height($previewWrapper.height());
[04:20:25] <axscode> is it appendTo
[04:20:34] <trini7y> can you help me correct the code and  Cork
[04:21:04] <Cork> axscode: so wrapp appendTo and this is the jquery object with the video tag somewhere in it
[04:21:21] <axscode> ill try now thanks corky
[04:23:27] <trini7y> Cork: am waiting
[04:23:53] <Cork> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/a5khuhek/2/

[04:28:10] <Mark_2> is there any slider plugin that supports touch screen?
[04:28:40] <Cork> ?g jquery touch punch
[04:28:42] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery UI Touch Punch - Touch Event Support for jQuery UI → http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[04:30:32] <Mark_2> um, slider.
[04:30:37] <Mark_2> like image slider.
[04:30:43] <Cork> so slideshow
[04:31:08] <Cork> (yes i know many slideshow authors love to overload the slider term)
[04:31:36] <Mark_2> i applied unslider, but for some reason the slider is dead http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[04:31:38] <Cork> and don't have recommendation there
[04:31:55] <Mark_2> sigh. due date is in 6 days
[04:31:57] <Cork> most slideshows is extramly buggy written so i tend to write them my self
[04:32:07] <Mark_2> the prize is macbook pro 15”
[04:32:20] <Mark_2> cork, can you give me your slider then? ;P
[04:32:26] <Cork> Mark_2: please use the correct term so ppl don't have to be confused
[04:32:34] <Mark_2> i see i see
[04:32:42] <Cork> ?g css3 slideshow
[04:32:44] <b-ot> Cork: A Pure CSS3 Cycling Slideshow - Smashing Magazine → http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/25/pure-css3-cycling-slideshow/
[04:33:13] <Cork> hmm not the one i used as a base, but close enough
[04:33:37] <Mark_2> i hate css3 based slider
[04:33:52] <Mark_2> it’s even more complicated than jquery version.
[04:35:52] <Cork> Mark_2: yes, it gets a bit more complicated cause they try to do it right
[04:36:02] <Cork> something 99% of all jquery slideshows don't
[04:37:09] <axscode> Hi Cork,  undefined is not an object (evaluating '$.fn') i usually start jQuery(
[04:37:38] <Cork> axscode: ah, (function($) {})(jQuery)
[04:37:48] <Cork> instead of the wrapper i added
[04:38:09] <axscode> ah got it thanks
[04:47:17] <pyCasso> would scraping an embeded twitter widget violate the twitter policy?
[04:47:40] <Cork> heh, wrong channel for that question
[04:48:29] <pyCasso> yeah, just wondering. using jquery to scrap the twitter widget for restyling.
[04:48:35] <Cork> pyCasso: if you can find a copyright of the widget you could answer it
[04:48:43] <Cork> else you would have to contact the one that owns the code
[04:48:59] <Cork> ah, restyling
[04:49:13] <Cork> that falls into branding policies
[04:49:20] <Cork> and ya, you have to ask twitter about that
[04:50:16] <pyCasso> yeah, the brand is still intact. i.e twitter icons and twitter seal. just better styling for my site
[04:50:27] <prohobo> hey, im coding in a module pattern like "var JsonField = {}"
[04:50:34] <prohobo> and adding all functions and vars to the object
[04:50:41] <Cork> pyCasso: branding usually include colors, spacing, margins and so forth too
[04:50:49] <prohobo> but i dont understand how this coding pattern allows for multiple instances of a "module"
[04:51:01] <prohobo> how can i assign an instance of JsonField to another variable?
[04:51:05] <Cork> prohobo: it doesn't
[04:51:11] <prohobo> god damn it
[04:51:26] <Cork> prohobo: you have to have a constructor for that
[05:15:48] <axscode> one last, how will i know what hook are called for the entire process of the page during that of adding element
[05:20:24] <Cork> axscode: hook?
[05:20:48] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/a5khuhek/2/
[05:21:02] <axscode> the one you created, i will check what has been triggered instead
[05:22:10] <Cork> what has been triggered?
[05:22:16] <Cork> sorry you're losing me
[05:22:44] <axscode> how to know what has been triggered .append, .appendTo, .prepend.. etc..
[05:23:02] <Cork> axscode: you explicitly wrap the appendTo call
[05:23:16] <Cork> so only those call will be caught
[05:23:47] <prohobo> nice
[05:23:56] <prohobo> REVEALING module pattern is much better
[05:24:00] <prohobo> i can easily make it static
[05:24:05] <prohobo> or instantiating
[05:24:19] <axscode> Cork, i tried i thought that was it, seems not triggering any on appendTo
[05:24:44] <Cork> axscode: then the scrip either uses it's own version of jquery
[05:24:53] <Cork> or isn't using appendTo
[05:25:06] <axscode> yes i might traced the wrong one
[05:25:11] <Cork> also you will have to replce the code in line 4-6
[05:25:16] <Cork> that is just a template
[05:25:40] <axscode> yes ive tried show, append prepend, html etc..
[05:25:45] <axscode> ill try browser debugger
[05:25:49] <Cork> no your missing the point
[05:25:58] <Cork> line 4 is the if(this.filter('p').length > 0) {
[05:26:13] <Cork> you have to do the search for the element you care about in there
[05:26:25] <Cork> else you will catch all calls to the function
[05:26:32] <Cork> even the ones that isn't from that script
[05:30:01] <prohobo> is this sexy or is this meh? http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-multiple-javascript-objects-when-using-the-revealing-module-pattern
[05:30:20] <prohobo> as a structural pattern
[05:30:57] <mbrzuzy> does myCalc = Calculator() instantiate a new object or is it just a reference to Calculator?
[05:31:05] <prohobo> instantiate
[05:31:15] <mbrzuzy> oh sweet
[05:31:45] <prohobo> so far this is working great for me
[05:31:56] <prohobo> i don't like having to list all my funcs in the return tho
[05:32:02] <prohobo> but that doesn't seem like an actual problem
[05:33:32] <Cork> prohobo: i would prob move most of those function into the prototype instead
[05:33:34] <Everie> hi guys, i've tried articulating this little question as simple as possible... it's quite noob stuff i think, http://pastebin.com/VmE83qX6
[05:33:45] <Cork> kinda silly to duplicate all that code for each instance
[05:34:59] <prohobo> Cork, i have no idea how to make a prototype so :D
[05:35:09] <prohobo> thanks
[05:36:14] <Cork> prohobo: function MyClass() {}; MyClass.property = { func1: function() {} };
[05:36:27] <Cork> var a = new MyClass(); <-- doesn't clone func1
[05:36:38] <Cork> opps
[05:36:47] <Cork> MyClass.prototype = { func1: function() {} };
[05:37:07] <Cork> prohobo: prototype is how js does inheritance
[05:37:48] <prohobo> ah i see
[05:38:15] <prohobo> so just push the functions to the prototype?
[05:38:29] <prohobo> leave vars/options in the class func
[05:45:18] <delboy1978uk> $(this).animate({   -webkit-transform: 'rotate(180deg)';   });     SyntaxError: invalid property id. How do i sort this?
[05:46:25] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: quote the property.
[05:46:45] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: I'm still not sure that'll work how you're expecting though.
[05:46:51] <delboy1978uk> its the dash that's screwing it up, i have it in quotes now and it says SyntaxError: missing } after property list
[05:47:05] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: No ; either.
[05:47:15] <delboy1978uk> yup removing those :P
[05:47:25] <decx> since when does animate do non numerical values?
[05:47:34] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: You should probably just be using CSS to do this though.
[05:48:08] <prohobo> Cork, that doesn't seem to be working for me...
[05:48:26] <delboy1978uk> it didnt work decx probably never lol
[05:48:38] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: Instead of animating add a class to the element and toggle that.
[05:50:19] <delboy1978uk> thats what im actually doing lol
[05:50:30] <delboy1978uk> at least im on the right track :P
[05:51:10] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: http://jsbin.com/vacowaziqe/1/edit?css,js,output something like this
[05:52:29] <Cork> prohobo: http://jsfiddle.net/qLsq24p0/
[05:54:32] <delboy1978uk> awesome ok its toggling, but can i transition it smoothly?
[05:57:04] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[05:57:23] <[Non]> Cork: Hi
[05:57:35] <[Non]> When the page loaded i want to jQuery search in specific div, can i do that?
[05:57:50] <[Non]> I mean, i want to search scContainer only, anyway to do that?
[05:58:00] <delboy1978uk> $('#div').find('div.whatever');
[05:58:10] <mariusz> i have a weird problem — i have a checkbox in a modal and for some reason if I do $('#checkbox').prop('checked'), or .is(':checked'), it always returns false.
[05:58:19] <mariusz> got any idea why this might happen?
[05:58:36] <Cork> [Non]: either use $().find() or you can combine it $('.scContainer <selector here>')
[05:59:22] <Cork> mariusz: make sure #checkbox only exist once in the page
[05:59:27] <delboy1978uk> mariusz: show us a paste
[06:00:12] <Cork> mariusz: $('[id="checkbox"]').length == 1
[06:01:34] <delboy1978uk> got it just needed 	transition: transform .5s;
[06:02:49] <prohobo> ty Cork
[06:15:39] <Everie> hey jquery people :)
[06:16:09] <Everie> can anyone help with a noob javascript to jquery question?
[06:16:10] <mariusz> Cork: yeah, I use Avgrund, turns out it clones the template so I have it twice now...
[06:16:30] <Cork> ?ask @ Everie
[06:16:31] <b-ot> Everie: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:16:52] <Everie> http://pastebin.com/VmE83qX6
[06:17:02] <Everie> yeah, uhm.. i've shaped it as a paste
[06:17:09] <Everie> because it's kinda complicated to explain
[06:17:20] <Cork> please ask the question in the channel
[06:17:24] <Cork> at least the outline of it
[06:17:43] <Everie> uhm, i have an old js function, and want to know how to write it in jquery
[06:18:01] <Cork> $('#dataElem').html()
[06:18:12] <Cork> wait... ug...
[06:18:19] <Cork> that old code doesn't even work
[06:18:26] <Everie> could be
[06:18:36] <Everie> i wrote it in the pastebin window
[06:18:44] <Cork> it generates a string of the html in "#dataElem"
[06:18:57] <Cork> it stores this string in dataDiv
[06:19:08] <Cork> and then replaces the content of dataDiv with the data in "data"
[06:19:20] <Cork> and exists the function (nullifying anything it did with dataDiv)
[06:19:39] <Cork> so... what are you actually trying to do?
[06:19:55] <Everie> hmm, well tbh i would use this.. just thought you could.. but uhm, if you say var dataDiv = document.getElementById("dataElem")
[06:20:11] <Everie> and then datadiv.innerHTML = "hi";
[06:20:18] <Cork> ah, makes more sense
[06:20:20] <Everie> should work if names are correct
[06:20:31] <Cork> $('#dataElem').html('hi')
[06:20:37] <Everie> anyway, make innerHTML of this div.. the output of the jquery function
[06:20:41] <Everie> yeah ok
[06:21:07] <Everie> but then there's this part:         $.get('/data.php', function(url) {
[06:21:23] <Everie> i understand i can edit the data.php part
[06:21:36] <Everie> but not really sure how things are put together in jquery
[06:22:02] <Cork> Everie: $('#dataElem').load('/data.php');
[06:22:20] <Everie> :o
[06:22:24] <Everie> alright :)
[06:22:27] <Cork> :D
[06:22:51] <Everie> and now how do i call this with fx. loadData() from a link?
[06:22:56] <Cork> or if you prefer $.get('url', function(url) { $('#dataElm').html(url); });
[06:23:04] <Cork> but those two do the same thing
[06:23:11] <Everie> yeah ok
[06:23:33] <Cork> Everie: you would have to bind event listeners for link clicks
[06:23:42] <Everie> oh
[06:24:01] <Cork> $(doucment).on('click', '.class-matching-the-elements', loadData);
[06:24:03] <Cork> for example
[06:24:05] <Everie> so i can't do href="javascript:loadData();" with jquery?
[06:24:09] <Cork> no
[06:24:18] <Everie> ok
[06:24:20] <Cork> you shouldn't use javascript: anything ever
[06:24:26] <Everie> lol ok
[06:24:28] <Cork> even without jquery
[06:24:42] <Everie> alright, noted
[06:24:43] <Cork> same for on<event-type-name> in the html
[06:25:08] <Everie> do you mean instead of onLoad?
[06:25:09] <Cork> Everie: also unless you intend to use the href="" url to something meaning full
[06:25:14] <Cork> you shouldn't use <a> tags
[06:25:20] <Cork> use <button> instead
[06:25:27] <Cork> you can style it to your harts content
[06:25:27] <Everie> hmm, ok
[06:25:37] <Everie> yeah, i see what you mean
[06:25:42] <Cork> *hearts even
[06:25:49] <Everie> :)
[06:26:07] <Cork> basically never ever use <a> unless it by it self is a working link
[06:26:30] <Everie> hmm, ok
[06:26:30] <Cork> and you for example want to make it more efficient then doing a full page reload through js
[06:26:46] <Cork> that is a perfect example of when you SHOULD use a link
[06:26:49] <Erwat> Cork: wait, really? never use <a> ?
[06:26:56] <Everie> well, i just wanna update some divs actively
[06:27:06] <Everie> i got it working with normal js
[06:27:07] <Erwat> ohhhh, you meant in this case; i see
[06:27:17] <Cork> Erwat: i mean never use <a href="">  <a href="#">  <a href="javascript:void(0)"> or so on
[06:27:29] <Cork> it should always have a functional url in them
[06:27:34] <Cork> if you use an <a> tag
[06:27:35] <Erwat> yes pls
[06:27:40] <Everie> hehe, ok
[06:27:51] <Everie> so <button> then
[06:27:53] <Erwat> because i hate middle clicking on something and it putting the url as javascript:void(0)
[06:27:59] <Everie> i guess you can make some stylish buttons
[06:28:03] <Cork> Erwat: ya, same here
[06:28:09] <Everie> lol
[06:28:14] <Everie> i never use middle click
[06:28:15] <slax0r> Cork: someone followed that "never use <a>" way too strictly in our company, and they did, <span class="some-class">name</span> $(".some-class").click(function() { window.location = "url"; });
[06:28:20] <slax0r> I thought I was going to throw up
[06:28:20] <Cork> Everie: you can make a button look just like a link if you like
[06:28:44] <Cork> slax0r: uuuuugggggg!!!!!
[06:28:49] <Everie> Cork, yeah.. i'm alright with css :)
[06:28:50] <Cork> slax0r: please let me kill them!!!
[06:28:58] <Everie> it's just jquery that is a mystery to me
[06:29:02] <Cork> ya, i've hit those sites too, and i hate it
[06:29:02] <slax0r> Cork: gladly! here, take my katana
[06:29:14] <Erwat> Everie: why use it then?
[06:29:16] <Cork> XD
[06:29:38] <Everie> Erwat, because it looks smoother than normal js for some things
[06:29:43] <Everie> like fetching .php stuff
[06:29:48] <Cork> Erwat: things is usually a mystery until you know it
[06:29:50] <slax0r> but I do use href="#", for placeholders, when the link to that action does not exist yet and I don't even know whre it will be located exactly :)
[06:30:09] <Everie> i really hate href="#" links though
[06:30:11] <Cork> slax0r: ya, me too, nothing strange with that
[06:30:31] <Everie> i avoided the going to non-existent-hash with javascript input though :D
[06:30:37] <Everie> but i'll do buttons from now on
[06:30:41] <Everie> promise :)
[06:31:06] <Cork> i'm glad jquery-ui finally fixed that longstanding bug
[06:31:17] <Cork> i was getting tired of patching there dialog plugin :/
[06:31:48] <Cork> (or the autocomplete for that matter)
[06:31:59] <slax0r> what bug?
[06:32:05] <slax0r> I rarely used those two tbh
[06:32:10] <Cork> the close button in dialogs used to be <a href="#">
[06:32:22] <Cork> and same for all entries in the dropdown from autocomplete
[06:32:44] <Cork> so i had to monkey patch the code to replace them with sane code
[06:32:54] <slax0r> oh
[06:33:17] <Cork> i know why they did though, you have to to support ie5.5
[06:33:32] <Cork> and they have finally dropped that support
[06:33:57] <Cork> (:hover doesn't work on any element other then a in ie< 5.5)
[06:34:42] <Cork> and not sure but i think the same goes for the hover event...
[06:35:13] <Everie> alright, lastly... as far as i've understood this line $(doucment).on('click', '.notAlink', loadData); calls a function called loadData when i click a button with the class="notAlink", right?
[06:35:31] <Cork> yes
[06:36:01] <Cork> ?g api.jqeury.com delegate
[06:36:02] <b-ot> Cork: Sorry, no results for ‟api.jqeury.com delegate”.
[06:36:05] <Everie> alright, so then how does $('#dataElem').load('/data.php'); know it's name is loadData?
[06:36:10] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[06:36:12] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:36:14] <Everie> trying to find that part in backlogs of the chat
[06:36:19] <Cork> Everie: you might want to read that page
[06:36:24] <Everie> alright
[06:36:25] <Cork> it explains how delegation works
[06:36:34] <Cork> (what that on line was)
[06:36:37] <Everie> nice bot feature though :)
[06:37:11] <Cork> Everie: it doesn't
[06:37:19] <Cork> you would have to create a function with that name
[06:37:28] <Cork> or use an anonymous inline function
[06:37:40] <Cork> $(doucment).on('click', '.notAlink', function() { $('#dataElem').load('/data.php'); });
[06:37:58] <Everie> alright
[06:38:15] <Everie> that last line looks essentially like i wanted it to
[06:38:35] <Cork> i love shrinking 20+ lines to one line with jquery :)
[06:38:38] <Cork> its so satisfying :D
[06:38:42] <Everie> hehe, i bet
[06:39:11] <Everie> i'm slowly starting to see a pattern in the setup of the lines
[06:39:33] <Everie> but it's just so different to me :)
[06:39:58] <slax0r> hm, if I clone an element, change it around a bit, then prepend/apend it somewhere, would it be wise to "unset" this clone?
[06:40:01] <slax0r> and how
[06:40:06] <Cork> Everie: it isn't that different actually
[06:40:29] <Cork> as soon as you stop thinking of $ as something special and just a function name like any other
[06:40:35] <Cork> things start to clear up
[06:40:48] <Everie> yeah
[06:40:59] <Everie> i guess it's the way i'm used to defining things
[06:41:11] <Everie> i'll figure it out
[06:41:14] <Everie> in time
[06:41:24] <Everie> this has been a great help though
[06:41:30] <Cork> slax0r: as long as you have no global variables holding onto it you should be safe
[06:41:42] <Everie> still need to test it in action, which i'm going to now
[06:41:51] <slax0r> no, the var holding the clone is defined in the function
[06:42:03] <slax0r> oh, right, they will be auto-unset at end of scope
[06:42:05] <Cork> Everie: $() creates a set of matched elements wrapped in a jquery object
[06:42:17] <slax0r> sometimes I need a high 5...with a chair...in the face
[06:42:24] <Everie> see now you're talking gibberish :)
[06:42:27] <Cork> Everie: all the other functions is then prototype functions of that object and it works on the set inside it
[06:42:50] <Cork> Everie: hmm you might want to learn some basic js too ^^'
[06:42:51] <Everie> hmm, ok
[06:43:11] <Everie> Cork, i'm getting to the learning it all part
[06:43:15] <MikeD_> i have a refresh button inside a div, the click handler uses .empty() then appends new content...  but after the second click, i'm getting double content
[06:43:18] <Everie> just need to finish this project, heh :D
[06:43:56] <Cork> Everie: ya, i used to be a believer in the "learn from the bottom up", until i found out its a horrible way to learn
[06:44:24] <Cork> you want to learn from about the middle down, have enough working to "have fun"
[06:44:32] <Everie> not even starting with "hello world" gets you nowhere quick when trying to learn a new language :D
[06:44:35] <Cork> else its often too much
[06:44:46] <Everie> yeah, nicely put :)
[06:45:12] <Everie> it's been quite some years since i learnt all this stuff last time though
[06:45:26] <Cork> so about ~ 13+ years ago i would have said "you should learn javascript first"... ugg
[06:45:29] <Everie> when <blink> was still frequently used
[06:45:42] <[Non]> hey, there is  a site which coded with angular and when you change menu it doesnt reload, what im trying to do is; if "a" div has "selected" do the thing. but it has to work when menu is changing
[06:45:49] <[Non]> how can i track it?
[06:46:01] <Cork> Everie: kinda shows javascript: isn't even referenced now days
[06:46:14] <Everie> yeah :)
[06:46:29] <Cork> but ya, i started WAY back in the dark ages of web development
[06:46:54] <Cork> when document.write / .writeln was the new "dynamic" features of the web...
[06:47:07] <Everie> haha
[06:47:24] <Everie> man i've had some fights with document.write
[06:47:42] <[Non]> i guess its not easy
[06:47:46] <Cork> its the black sheep of the dom model
[06:48:24] <Everie> it was such a relief to come back to webcoding a couple of years later and you can handle the page easier
[06:48:32] <Everie> however, ALOT have happened last couple of years
[06:48:36] <Cork> [Non]: should be doable, just check for the class on click
[06:49:05] <[Non]> im thinking of use .change function
[06:49:10] <Cork> Everie: ya, i worked with it through the worst of it
[06:49:18] <Cork> and... it made me want to cry sometimes
[06:49:29] <Everie> oh i can imagine
[06:49:39] <Cork> [Non]: change is for form elements not links
[06:49:50] <[Non]> oh jeez
[06:49:51] <Everie> that's where i am now, just more new stuff :)
[06:50:20] <Cork> Everie: the worst time was when web browser development started to move again
[06:50:23] <Everie> i'm coping quite well though, this is the first time i gave in and asked irc... after a couple of weeks
[06:50:28] <Cork> but you still had to support ie5
[06:50:33] <Cork> UGG T_T
[06:50:35] <Everie> oh shit, yeah
[06:50:45] <Everie> luckily that was all fixed when i came back
[06:50:47] <Everie> :D
[06:51:08] <Everie> still not fun to work with <audio> and such though
[06:51:16] <Cork> when it was at worst i coded a separate version for ie < 6
[06:51:18] <Everie> and then there's mobile browsers
[06:51:20] <Cork> separate html and everything
[06:51:50] <Everie> that sounds painful, Cork :)
[06:51:53] <Cork> and the css for ie6 was about twice as big as the rest of the other browsers combined (for the "normal" view)
[06:51:57] <Cork> ya, it was
[06:52:27] <Cork> hen a few years later ppl complained about ie6 support, sure that's still bad, but.. ya
[06:52:44] <Cork> it's pain on a different level
[06:52:50] <Everie> haha
[06:53:23] <Everie> i honestly don't even give a hoot about ie anymore. i read on reddit that there's a new team dev'ing it now.. and it should apparently change name?
[06:53:29] <Everie> but i just can't be arsed
[06:54:02] <Cork> not change name no
[06:54:08] <Cork> but they are developing a new engine
[06:54:13] <Everie> aah
[06:54:15] <Cork> though ie10+ is quite fine
[06:54:23] <Cork> i don't have a problem with it
[06:54:30] <Everie> well, according to the AMA it should actually be quite good
[06:54:45] <Cork> biggest problem is that you basically need a full windows install to test for it
[06:54:51] <Cork> and... ya, not a big fan of that
[06:54:59] <Everie> but i mean, when designing, i am happy if it works in firefox and chrome. ie users are lucky if it looks okay to them
[06:55:12] <Camaban> I have to support ie7 at work still
[06:55:21] <Everie> :(
[06:55:37] <Cork> i know places that still have a mandatory ie6 support
[06:55:51] <axscode> if i have a classname how can i know what element it is? like <div class='magic'></div><span class='lildevil'></span>
[06:55:58] <Everie> i'm glad i'm not working with this professionally yet :o
[06:56:18] <Cork> axscode: you mean you want to get the name of the element?
[06:56:21] <Everie> i can be okay with "it works" :)
[06:56:31] <axscode> yes if its div or span in this case
[06:57:16] <Cork> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/qk10r4hL/
[06:58:12] <Everie> btw, what are your preferred editors for javascript/php/web stuff? .. i can't help but thinking there must be something better than notepad++ ... at least with better variable overview like eclipse.. just not heavy like eclipse :D
[06:58:27] <Cork> anything == sublime text
[06:58:46] <Cork> or if i need be text only interface (console) == vim
[06:59:56] <Everie> oh, i love the presentation of sublime already (from their front page)
[07:00:18] <Cork> ya, its close to a developer addiction now days :)
[07:01:14] <Everie> :)
[07:01:25] <Everie> and i guess it also has auto-indent
[07:01:39] <Cork> sure
[07:01:53] <Cork> the most addictive feature is the multi edit
[07:02:08] <Everie> yeah, i saw it, but will see how it is to work with
[07:02:12] <Cork> where you can select places with a specific word and then get duplicate cursors at each place
[07:02:17] <axscode> ah thanks, one more... how about var $element = "<div class='magic'><span class='lildevil'></span></div>";   how can i detect '.magic'  tagName if its in the variable?
[07:02:24] <Everie> but it had some feautures tha looks very handy
[07:02:25] <Cork> so you can edit like 25 places in the file at the same time :)
[07:02:41] <Everie> yeah, better than a dodgy replace command
[07:02:47] <Everie> i like it :)
[07:03:26] <Cork> axscode: $($element).filter('div.magic'
[07:03:28] <Cork> opps
[07:03:36] <Cork> axscode: if($($element).filter('div.magic').length > 0)
[07:03:38] <mooncup> 16:01 < Cork> the most addictive feature is the multi edit
[07:03:41] <mooncup> I love that feature
[07:03:44] <axscode> hmmm
[07:03:44] <Cork> if $element is a string that is
[07:03:52] <mooncup> not enough to make me give up the ide-y stuff from netbeans though
[07:03:58] <mooncup> jumping to function declarations etc
[07:05:58] <cordovafan8> Hello. I am having an issue with jquery mobile dialog('close'). It seems that no matter what I do, this will refresh the parent page, and cause it to hang while reloading. Is there a way to prevent dialog('close') reloading the parent page?
[07:06:20] <Everie> oh, i'm really liking sublime text :o.. the more i'm looking at it
[07:06:27] <Everie> i'm buying this @ payday \o/
[07:16:14] <prohobo> so i think i found a problem with revealing module pattern
[07:16:36] <prohobo> i can't call jquery UI functions within a module function i think
[07:16:48] <prohobo> well i'm going to have to do something to workaround it
[07:17:53] <prohobo> nvm
[07:18:00] <prohobo> put the files in the wrong folder
[07:18:02] <prohobo> :D
[07:18:24] <DRSK> Anyone know how to translate3d(100vw-widthofel,0,0) to "immitate" right: 0; ?
[07:18:29] <ashka> hi, on this short code $('elem').on('click', function() { $(this)...; $.get('url', function(data) { //here }); }); what is the best way to access the current elem at "//here" that is accessed with $(this) one "level" above ?
[07:18:53] <vulpes-> Hi, how can I make .next() continue back at 0 ? it's working with what i got but once it reads that last sibling, it of course can't pick the next one, i'd like to have it start over with the first sibling
[07:20:58] <BillCriswell> vulpes-: $(this).next() || $(this).parent().find('.foo').first() could work... unless you're dealing with a collection in which can you just keep track of an index.
[07:21:10] <vulpes-> ashka: kind of a vague question, but there's a lot of ways. Here's one: $(this).parent().find('thatelementtype');
[07:21:23] <shoky> || won't work for that
[07:21:29] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: i should have mentioned it's a ul with lis
[07:22:24] <BillCriswell> shoky: Good point.
[07:22:33] <BillCriswell> vulpes-: Do you have them in a collection?
[07:23:02] <newer> hello
[07:23:04] <newer> question
[07:23:05] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: yes a <ul>
[07:23:08] <newer> I am getting this error DataTables warning: table id=DataTables_Table_5 - Requested unknown parameter '17' for row 0. For more information about this error, please see http://datatables.net/tn/4
[07:23:20] <newer> I think it is because some cells of the data table are empty
[07:23:26] <BillCriswell> vulpes-: I mean like... var $lis = $('li');
[07:23:35] <newer> I can not find the way of preventing it..
[07:24:30] <newer> I have tried using columns.defaultContent ...
[07:24:34] <newer> any expert on that area?
[07:24:40] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: hm, no not like that. Simply put im doing $('li.scur').next().fadeIn();
[07:24:43] <shoky> ashka: $('elem').on('click', function() { var $elem = $(this); ... $.get('url', function(data) { $elem }); });
[07:26:12] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: I like where your thoughts are though, are you suggesting there's a way to make it like a list, sort of like an array, that it can keep doing next in and repeat?
[07:26:24] <BillCriswell> vulpes-:
[07:26:25] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:26:47] <vulpes-> I'm not sure how to go about doing that
[07:26:53] <ashka> shoky: okay, I wasn't sure this was the "cleanest" way. thanks
[07:27:44] <vulpes-> shoky: Miracle worker, I didn't get his question at all =]
[07:27:46] <newer> I am getting TypeError: nTd is undefined in  jquery.dataTables.js:1673
[07:28:01] <ashka> vulpes-: sorry, it wasn't very clear in the first place
[07:28:37] <vulpes-> ashka: yeah, sometimes it's hard to relate what we know to another person ;]
[07:29:15] <BillCriswell> vulpes-: http://jsbin.com/duyora/6/edit?html,js,output something like this
[07:30:06] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: I'v tried so many things by now, but resulted in either not looping or getting index of -1 and things like that.
[07:30:22] <vulpes-> BillCriswell: Fantastic, this is a new approach to me. Thanks a lot :]!
[07:30:24] <shoky> i like:   index = (index + 1) % itemsCount;
[07:30:41] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ooo fancy.
[07:30:54] <vulpes-> shoky: what does the % do in there
[07:31:40] <shoky> vulpes-: it's a mod operator, gives the remainder of division
[07:33:31] <shoky> 0%3 = 0,   1%3 = 1,   2%3 = 2,  3%3 = 0,   4%3 = 1,    5%3 = 2,  etc    cycles between 0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,etc
[07:34:21] <vulpes-> neat, thanks for explaining
[07:34:38] <shoky> np
[07:41:31] <vsoftoiletpaper> hi
[07:41:45] <vsoftoiletpaper> how does jquery find the height of elements with display: none?
[07:42:19] <vsoftoiletpaper> does it momentarily display the element?
[07:45:16] <vulpes-> yes but with visibility:hidden; I believe
[07:45:44] <vulpes-> but have you tried it out and see what happens?
[07:46:30] <vulpes-> it should be able to still get a height px value for you
[08:00:41] <multi_io_> how do you select all elements with two specific CSS classes?
[08:01:15] <vulpes-> multi_io_: just space the names $('class1 class2')
[08:01:51] <vulpes-> woops
[08:01:52] <vulpes-> with a .
[08:02:08] <vulpes-> .class.class2
[08:02:26] <vulpes-> (in my defense, addclass can do ('class class2') ;p
[08:03:05] <baako> hi guys I am trying to remove the li long with the image wrap in it if the value in li data-id is no longer in the array. I have try it like this http://kopy.io/n3a75 but it doesn't seem to remove the image
[08:03:19] <multi_io_> vulpes-: ah, without a space in between
[08:03:23] <baako> and the li where am i going wrong?
[08:03:28] <multi_io_> ok thanks
[08:03:31] <vulpes-> np
[08:05:37] <multi_io_> can you also select for a class and a style?
[08:05:55] <vulpes-> multi_io_: why a style, that seems odd to do
[08:06:07] <multi_io_> i.e. all elements that have two .class1.class2 and style display:block
[08:06:52] <cryptopsy> how do i place a jqueryui accordion to the right side of an image? Right now it's being placed under it
[08:07:41] <AlexR__> float the image left
[08:08:01] <AlexR__> jsfiddle your html
[08:08:30] <cryptopsy> style="float:left;" ?
[08:08:49] <cryptopsy> now the image is part of the accordion
[08:08:52] <vulpes-> multi_io_: i might be mistaken but that's kinda tricky for something that can be solved easier by adding another class to those that are hidden
[08:09:16] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: its an img inside an a href , if that matters
[08:09:20] <vulpes-> multi_io_: say 'hide' then target that with your jQuery. and .hide {display:none} in your css file
[08:09:44] <AlexR__> cryptopsy: show some code, it all depends on how your html is layed out
[08:09:49] <AlexR__> laid out*
[08:10:05] <multi_io_> vulpes-: yeah, I probably should
[08:10:21] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: http://sprunge.us/SRKc
[08:10:47] <AlexR__> you said your image is inside an a tag?
[08:11:05] <cryptopsy> it had <a href="main.html> </a> around it
[08:11:14] <cryptopsy> i just took it out for testing
[08:11:26] <AlexR__> then the <a> should have a float left
[08:11:39] <AlexR__> the .accordion div should also have float left
[08:11:54] <cryptopsy> i want the accordion to be on the right side of the image
[08:11:55] <AlexR__> or display: inline-block
[08:12:25] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: it works with float left in both
[08:12:41] <cryptopsy> if i use inline-block do i still need float-left in <a> ?
[08:12:50] <vulpes-> multi_io_: don't give yourself a headache, nothing wrong with that approach :]
[08:13:11] <AlexR__> a might not need anything, i'm not great on my css-- it depends on what the default display type of a is (which actually might be inline block already)
[08:13:28] <AlexR__> try to just do inline block on the div (which i know has a default display of "block")
[08:14:05] <cryptopsy> the accordion div?
[08:14:42] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: with inline-block, the accordion goes to the bottom
[08:14:46] <cryptopsy> its on the right side but at the bottom
[08:15:06] <AlexR__> then just do the float lefts
[08:15:20] <cordovafan8> I am completely stumped. I cannot figure out how to stop dialog('close') reloading the parent page.
[08:15:33] <AlexR__> http://jsfiddle.net/z6edg1qm/
[08:15:43] <cryptopsy> i want it all to be centered vertically and horizontally on the page , so im going to put it in a surrounding div. can i give float to that div?
[08:17:24] <AlexR__> play with it and see what happens
[08:18:00] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: when i center it vert+horiz with position:absolute left:50% top:50% , it no longer places the menu to the right
[08:18:05] <cryptopsy> so lets see with float now ..
[08:18:08] <baako> hi guys I am trying to remove the li long with the image wrap in it if the value in li data-id is no longer in the array. I have try it like this http://kopy.io/n3a75 but it doesn't seem to remove the image. I have done console.log on the selectors var and i habe notice [data-id='2'],[data-id='1']. The thing is my database is only selecting id which are active so if id 2 was to be inactive shouldn't the var statuses[] update the list?
[08:18:24] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: i don't understand what float is doing
[08:18:30] <baako> but instead it is still keeping all the id including the inactive id
[08:18:40] <baako> how can I stop this?
[08:19:01] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: doesn't work with float, here's the updated code: http://sprunge.us/ShVG
[08:19:05] <AlexR__> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float
[08:19:21] <AlexR__> cryptopsy: please use jsfiddle, that way i can actually see the code working
[08:19:33] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: i can just upload it to my server, is that ok?
[08:19:45] <AlexR__> jsfiddle is easier since i can edit it in real time
[08:19:54] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: but hard for me to paste
[08:20:02] <cryptopsy> copy buffer r screwed up
[08:20:07] <vulpes-> cryptopsy: you want help. work for it ;]
[08:20:21] <AlexR__> jsfiddle has a tidy up button
[08:20:25] <AlexR__> it'll fix all the weirdness
[08:21:25] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: how does jsfiddle know where to find my js?
[08:21:39] <AlexR__> you don't need your js in this case
[08:21:41] <AlexR__> it's just styles
[08:22:11] <cryptopsy> this is huge pain in the ass, so here you go
[08:22:23] <cryptopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/k8d0gbdk/
[08:22:58] <AlexR__> can you paste your styles in as well?
[08:23:20] <cryptopsy> i dont have my own style, its just the default jqueryui style sheet
[08:23:34] <AlexR__> okay
[08:23:52] <cryptopsy> style.css doesn't exist
[08:24:41] <nutzz> I have a text input field on my web app and every time a user clicks a specific button the value that is in that text field is send to the serverv via ajax. At the beginning, I used someting like this( $.post('path', {value: $("#text_field_id").val()})) it didn't work, it gaved me bad request error 400. I read more a about ajaz and post request and I found something about a serialize method
[08:25:01] <nutzz> with it it works, but the value of $("#text_field").serialize() is ""
[08:25:40] <nutzz> what's the proper way of sending the value of that text field via ajax to the server?
[08:26:26] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/zm6eba40/ sorry to be a pain, its my first day using jquery
[08:26:37] <BackEndCoder> i am trying to make a php array into a readable js obj
[08:26:51] <BackEndCoder> it would seem wrapping it in a json_encode isn't how it needs to be
[08:27:04] <BackEndCoder> i have 2 examples, the wrong broken one, and the dummy data that works
[08:27:15] <BackEndCoder> how can i make it sparse as a valid js data input, thanks
[08:28:20] <BackEndCoder> my orignal attempts are var data = "Array";
[08:28:40] <baako> BillCriswell:
[08:31:51] <xelim> BackEndCoder: use JSON.parse(string); to convert json encoded string to js object(or array)
[08:32:52] <BackEndCoder> thanks i will google that
[08:35:24] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: is it centering for you?
[08:35:30] <AlexR__> working on it
[08:35:33] <BackEndCoder> var data = JSON.parse(<?php echo json_encode($applicant_countries);?>); looks ok ?
[08:35:40] <BackEndCoder> getting some werid error with my doctype now
[08:35:41] <BackEndCoder> :(
[08:35:58] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: position:absolute; left:50%; top:50%; is not centering it relative to window size, which is what i want
[08:36:16] <AlexR__> try position:relative on the parent
[08:36:33] <cryptopsy> AlexR__: that's interesting, it fixes the float
[08:36:49] <cryptopsy> it's still not centering though
[08:37:34] <xelim> BackEndCoder: var data = JSON.parse('<?php echo json_encode($applicant_countries);?>');
[08:37:42] <BackEndCoder> thanks :D
[08:38:47] <snover> are you serious
[08:38:56] <xelim> cryptopsy: try adding -<prefixes>-transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
[08:39:04] <cryptopsy> where?
[08:39:04] <snover> var data = <?php echo json_encode($applicant_countries); ?>
[08:39:10] <snover> json is javascript
[08:39:12] <snover> for goodness ake
[08:40:08] <xelim> cryptopsy: on the element that you want centered
[08:40:35] <xelim> cryptopsy: ex: position:absolute; left:50%; top:50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
[08:40:45] <cryptopsy> xelim: didn't do it
[08:42:04] <cryptopsy> xelim: what you suggested is the same as display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle;
[08:45:03] <xelim> cryptopsy: if you take a look here http://jsfiddle.net/k8d0gbdk/4/, you can see that it's centered relatively to the document
[08:46:14] <xelim> BackEndCoder: snover is absolutely right, if you are directly injecting json in the html you should use his solution
[08:51:58] <rochadt> test
[08:52:19] <baako> hi guys I am trying to remove the li long with the image wrap in it if the value in li data-id is no longer in the array. I have try it like this http://kopy.io/n3a75 but it doesn't seem to remove the image. I have done console.log on the selectors var and i habe notice [data-id='2'],[data-id='1']. The thing is my database is only selecting id which are active so if id 2 was to be inactive shouldn't the var statuses[] update the list? but instead it is
[08:52:19] <baako> still keeping all the id including the inactive id. How can I stop this?
[08:53:40] <cryptopsy> xelim: http://i.imgur.com/eZoN3IR.png
[08:54:06] <cryptopsy> and notice the accordion isnt to left of the image
[08:54:27] <xelim> cryptopsy: what browser are you using ?
[08:54:40] <cryptopsy> webkit-tk
[08:54:41] <cryptopsy> gtk
[08:54:50] <cryptopsy> here's what i see http://i.imgur.com/0jrpbIx.png
[08:55:13] <baako> lol cryptopsy
[08:55:52] <xelim> cryptopsy: ok, lets try with -webkit prefix http://jsfiddle.net/k8d0gbdk/5/
[08:57:03] <cryptopsy> works
[08:57:14] <xelim> cryptopsy: phew :D
[08:57:17] <cryptopsy> accordion is under picture though
[08:57:20] <cryptopsy> should be on right
[08:57:49] <xelim> cryptopsy: try expanding the container a little
[08:58:08] <xelim> cryptopsy: you are centering the container, right ?
[08:58:26] <cryptopsy> yes
[08:58:33] <cryptopsy> the container doesn't have a size therefore it should accomodate it
[08:58:46] <cryptopsy> and its still not centering when i put it in my code
[08:58:52] <cryptopsy> its slightly off to the left, like 20%
[08:59:28] <xelim> cryptopsy: hmm so there is probably something else that is messing up ...
[08:59:37] <cryptopsy> with position:relative the menu is in the right place and the top margin of the image is center veritcally, but they're not centered horizzontally
[09:00:12] <cryptopsy> fixed does the thing as absolute in this case
[09:00:38] <cryptopsy> this didn't work either http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/09/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/
[09:03:19] <xelim> cryptopsy: the only solution i can think of is to expand the container
[09:03:50] <cryptopsy> this would be easier without float
[09:04:44] <cryptopsy> xelim: think i got it
[09:05:00] <cryptopsy> well its centered with block-inline on accordion and float on the image
[09:05:07] <cryptopsy> but they're overlapping !
[09:05:32] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/KEDQSSM.png
[09:06:14] <cryptopsy> xelim: works when i remove float from image
[09:06:21] <cryptopsy> but the menu is not to the right
[09:06:28] <cryptopsy> how come not? it is block-inline'ed
[09:06:44] <xelim> cryptopsy: if you can add the styles to your fiddle i could be able to do more
[09:06:53] <cryptopsy> xelim: dont have a style
[09:06:57] <cryptopsy> file doesn't exist
[09:11:11] <cryptopsy> looks like jqueryui uses fixed-height inline style
[09:16:16] <xelim> cryptopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/k8d0gbdk/7/
[09:16:49] <cryptopsy> looks ok in jsfiddle
[09:17:33] <the8thbit|work> hm, which I check an ID's position or offset, I'm getting undefined
[09:18:00] <the8thbit|work> but the element itself exists
[09:18:18] <the8thbit|work> I can print its jquery object to the console
[09:18:26] <cryptopsy> xelim: doens't work when i merge those changes to my file
[09:18:36] <cryptopsy> it centers but the menu is under the pic
[09:19:05] <cryptopsy> here's the file just in case i made a mistake
[09:19:12] <cryptopsy> http://sprunge.us/SPHM
[09:20:09] <the8thbit|work> this is what I'm trying: console.log($j("#request_search_t1_header_row").offset());
[09:21:19] <petzup> hy, need little help with my code.. i can't figure how would i make to automaticly fill next ul with <li> which are limited... http://jsfiddle.net/u6ynurty/
[09:23:16] <xelim> cryptopsy: have you considered the styles on the right of the fiddle
[09:23:50] <v0lksman> hey all!  I know this isn't really a jquery question but I've had lots of luck in this channel for issues like this figured I'd try:  http://jsbin.com/zekopozosi/1/
[09:24:26] <v0lksman> can't figure out for the life of me why the right margin is suddenly ignored when the affix module fixes the position of my nav component
[09:28:12] <Omar-> v0lksman right margin in buttons?
[09:28:15] <cryptopsy> xelim: ah no, forgot
[09:28:29] <v0lksman> Omar-: no of the container
[09:28:40] <v0lksman> suddenly the buttons bleed out of the container
[09:28:45] <night-owl> can anyone recommend a lightweight datepicker plugin?
[09:30:27] <cryptopsy> xelim: now my image is warped,
[09:30:37] <cryptopsy> but its centered and the menu in the right place
[09:30:53] <cordovafan8> is there any reason not to do a $(selector).dialog('close'); in the onclick of a button inside the dialog itself?
[09:31:08] <cryptopsy> xelim: menu goes under the pic if i remove the image size parameters from container img
[09:31:14] <BackEndCoder> snover, thanks for the help, it didn't like the json pure
[09:31:24] <BackEndCoder> i manged to get it worked with the JSON.sparce
[09:31:50] <cryptopsy> xelim: works if i remove all the padding and image resize
[09:32:19] <cryptopsy> xelim: well it semi works ... when the browser is in full screen everything is ok but when its just large enough (theres like 5px line above and below), the menu is placed under the image!
[09:32:26] <cryptopsy> mind blowing
[09:33:29] <cryptopsy> what's even weirder, if i resize the to a window of the same wdith but larger height, menu is placed undernearh image
[09:33:46] <cryptopsy> even though, both image and menu fits in the width of the browser window, inline
[09:34:18] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/NcpoKID.png
[09:35:11] <cryptopsy> works with menu width is 300px but not when its 400px ... image is 500px
[09:35:55] <cryptopsy> heres pic of it working; http://i.imgur.com/LYYWNaZ.png
[09:36:56] <cryptopsy> you can see it here on my server; cpov.info
[09:37:48] <cryptopsy> xelim: gonna go try it in windows brb
[09:41:35] <Omar-> v0lksman shrink screen http://jsbin.com/zozetevoco/1
[09:43:31] <v0lksman> Omar-: not sure what you mean
[09:43:47] <v0lksman> when resizing the viewport the error persists
[09:43:47] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/zozetevoco/1 try this
[09:44:06] <Omar-> maybe you just need to add "white-space: normal;" to .btn-cta
[09:44:30] <v0lksman> same...as soon as the button row becomes affixed the right edge of the container is the edge of the view port
[09:44:55] <v0lksman> setting max-width: on the .affix class seems to help but seems dirty
[09:45:10] <xelim> cryptopsy: add `white-space: nowrap;` to the container this should fix it
[09:45:43] <Omar-> oh I didnt see the js there
[09:45:51] <Omar-> I thought it was a css-related issue
[09:46:08] <Omar-> v0lksman ^^
[09:46:51] <v0lksman> Omar-: well it is a CSS related issue triggered by a JS event that changes the position from relative to fixed
[09:47:46] <Omar-> v0lksman i'm trying to figure out the issue. What I can see is that text in buttons is bleeding out of the wrapping container of each
[09:47:52] <Omar-> is that the issue?
[09:49:00] <v0lksman> not yet...that will likely be fixed once the width of the row containing the buttons is set to within the "container" width which is the problem...it's bleeding out to the right of that container width when fixed
[09:49:04] <Omar-> oh got it, it appears when you scroll
[09:49:11] <v0lksman> Omar-: yes...sorry
[09:49:19] <Omar-> order now bleeds out
[09:49:21] <v0lksman> trying to explain but not very articulate it appears... :)
[09:49:47] <v0lksman> Omar-: yes but all the buttons increase in width cause they think there is the extra space...
[09:50:45] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I think I've read about 20 of your stackoverflow replies today :D
[09:51:11] <cordovafan8> maybe I'm assuming you're someone else, but it seems a coincidence
[09:51:26] <vulpes-> I are Omar!
[09:52:52] <cordovafan8> you are Omar? I'm confused now
[09:52:57] <Omar-> v0lksman just add left: 0; to .btn-vta
[09:53:24] <Omar-> cordovafan8 hi, I quit contributing to SO since 2 weeks or so
[09:53:39] <Omar-> cordovafan8 https://expertflow.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/another-trusted-user-said-goodbyte-to-stack-overflow/
[09:53:41] <cordovafan8> :o, why?
[09:53:56] <Omar-> I'm better off here and on jQuery forum
[09:54:43] <cordovafan8> ah, well I've been trying out a lot of your suggestions re: dialogs, nothing yet, but I'm still trying :)
[09:55:51] <Omar-> cordovafan8 if you have any question regarding jQM, let me know :)
[09:56:03] <v0lksman> Omar-: nope...didn't work...but I don have a solution that I'll run with.  Have spent far too long on this issue and working (however hacky) is better than not... ;)
[09:56:30] <v0lksman> what I ended up doing is setting my .affix class to a max-width on my device breakpoints
[09:56:51] <Omar-> v0lksman the issue is when the menu is fixed, it should be forced to go left as you have negative margins (-15)
[09:57:25] <v0lksman> Omar-: it's not off by only 15px though...it's off by any amount past the right of the "container" class
[09:57:42] <Omar-> yea i've seen it
[09:58:25] <Omar-> v0lksman sorry, cta-buttons class not .btn-cta
[09:58:51] <cordovafan8> Omar-: Sure. I'm having issues with $(selector).dialog('close') in jqm. Basically I'm showing a disclaimer that will pop up as a dialog (using $.mobile.changePage() on pagebeforeshow), but when I close the dialog, the parent page seems to 'freeze' for a few seconds. I think this is because dialog('close') is forcing a reload, and displays the page too early.
[09:59:07] <cordovafan8> I'm looking for any possible workaround I can find
[09:59:25] <Omar-> when you are you calling the dialog? and which jQM version are you using?
[09:59:33] <v0lksman> Omar-: still tweaking numbers but the added CSS at the bottom is my fix:  http://jsbin.com/sopewamahe/1
[09:59:50] <Omar-> v0lksman left: 0; added to .cta-buttons
[09:59:56] <v0lksman> will try
[09:59:57] <v0lksman> :)
[10:01:10] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I'm using jqm 1.3.1 (I know this is not good, but I don't have a choice) and I'm opening the dialog in my delegate function for my main page on 'pagebeforeshow'. I tried out pagebefore change per one of your suggestions, but it didn't seem to fire.
[10:01:14] <v0lksman> Omar-: close but no cigar..that then makes that row edge to edge in the viewport...I need it centered with all the margins and padding of my "container" class
[10:07:51] <Omar-> cordovafan8 sorry I was afk
[10:08:06] <Omar-> cordovafan8 opening a dialog on pagebeforeshow isn't a good idea
[10:08:36] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I previously had it in pageshow, is that a better idea?
[10:09:18] <Omar-> well, there's a drity work around, using setTimeout
[10:09:32] <Omar-> because most likely the dialog will be closed on such events
[10:09:34] <cordovafan8> basically I check a localstorage variable, and if it's not set, I open the dialog, which sets the localstorage variable, and the dialog is never opened again.
[10:09:38] <Omar-> what do you want to achieve?
[10:09:41] <mirko> is there anything which would help me to json-fy like this? http://pastebin.com/hc4mjAwZ
[10:10:11] <Omar-> cordovafan8 on startup? or later within navigation?
[10:10:15] <mirko> or - what's best practice to name form fields to have some structured in a proper way?
[10:10:23] <mirko> and not just flat as key=value ?
[10:10:31] <robertmaxrees> mirko depends.
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> mirko your backend should generally handle that mapping for you.
[10:10:52] <Omar-> v0lksman the problem is bootstrap css is interferring
[10:11:01] <robertmaxrees> names in the form map to names in the back, and the back does all the transforms for you.
[10:11:10] <mirko> robertmaxrees: i was thinking about this and i figured the backend should provide a sane API
[10:11:11] <cordovafan8> Omar-: so far the opening has worked fine for me, it's the closing which is freezing. Perhaps because it returns to the pagebeforeshow delegate long after subsequent events (ie pageshow etc) have fired?
[10:11:20] <mirko> and i find it more saner structured that way than just flat
[10:11:34] <robertmaxrees> mirko except in cases like forms, which are inherently key=value :)
[10:11:34] <cordovafan8> Omar-: sorry I was scrolled up, this webclient doesn't go to the bottom
[10:11:47] <Omar-> cordovafan8 maybe events are racing
[10:11:52] <mirko> robertmaxrees: however that API is not just used by that web app
[10:11:52] <Omar-> can u create a fiddle?
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> mirko you can try to build that, but i'd let your backend handle it for you.
[10:12:00] <mirko> robertmaxrees: okay, thanks
[10:12:23] <cordovafan8> Omar-: what I want to achieve is open a dialog on first run of application only, close it, then go back to main page without reload
[10:13:04] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I will try. I'm not sure I can reproduce the behavior though, since I don't know where the problem is yet heh
[10:13:06] <Omar-> cordovafan8 http://stackoverflow.com/a/26833994/4469330 try one of these solutions
[10:13:16] <Omar-> pagebeforechange instead of pagecontainerbeforechange
[10:13:47] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: make the dialog your actual first page, pre-fetch your actual first page
[10:14:03] <arschmitz> set a cookie when you go to dialog first time
[10:14:21] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: then in pagecontainerbeforechange check the cookie
[10:14:31] <arschmitz> if its set redirect to the index page
[10:15:18] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I like the pre-fetching idea. I am not sure I can make the dialog my first page because of the way its built up, but I will try out Omar's link first and get back to you.
[10:18:35] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: ok let me know if you need help im on of the devs for JQM
[10:19:03] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: thanks man, I appreciate all suggestions. I'm just slow :)
[10:19:15] <Omar-> cordovafan8 arschmitz solution is correct too
[10:19:28] <Omar-> not to mention he's jQM dev leader
[10:19:41] <Omar-> i'm just a jQM fan
[10:19:56] <Omar-> arschmitz what do you think about http://stackoverflow.com/a/26833994/4469330 ;)
[10:20:50] <arschmitz> Omar-: thats essentially exactly what i just said i think
[10:21:00] <arschmitz> execpt i said you need both not just one to cover al cases
[10:21:24] <Omar-> arschmitz which one you find more appealing, mobileinit or beforechange?
[10:21:25] <arschmitz> oh execpt i advised use of pre-fetch
[10:21:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: you need both
[10:21:38] <arschmitz> because you cant redirect on first load
[10:21:40] <Omar-> pre-fetch in case of SPM
[10:21:47] <Omar-> yeA?
[10:22:06] <cordovafan8> oh now I remember why the pagebeforecreate was wonky, because I can't bind it to a particular id, so using it in delegate is not great :x
[10:22:15] <Omar-> or like I did, make dialog div as first div in page container
[10:22:40] <Omar-> pagecreate can be delegated to a specific id/class
[10:22:57] <cordovafan8> oh did I use the wrong one again *scrolls up*
[10:22:58] <Omar-> in 1.3 all events can be delegated except for pagebeforechange
[10:23:02] <Omar-> lol
[10:23:06] <cordovafan8> lol
[10:23:11] <arschmitz> Omar-: remember those are going away
[10:23:21] <Omar-> arschmitz I know, he's using 1.3
[10:23:33] <arschmitz> oh ok
[10:23:35] <Omar-> cordovafan8 is it possible to upgrade to 1.4?
[10:23:45] <Omar-> it's much better for you and us :P
[10:23:49] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: i really would not recomend using 1.3 on something new at this point
[10:23:54] <arschmitz> its nearly 2 years old
[10:24:58] <cordovafan8> arschmitz , Omar- : I would *looooove* to use jqm 1.4 or higher
[10:25:06] <cordovafan8> but I can't
[10:25:31] <Omar-> hmmm you must have inherited a project using jqm 1.3
[10:25:40] <cordovafan8> even 1.3.2 would be better, but we're in it now unfortunately
[10:25:47] <cordovafan8> yes
[10:26:25] <Omar-> no problem, cordovafan8 1.3 is still better than previous versions
[10:27:42] <cordovafan8> also have cordova in case that matters. I just went through changing the whole bootstrap the other day, fun times.
[10:28:03] <Omar-> i have 0 experience in cordova
[10:28:19] <cordovafan8> Anyway, trying to open dialog (via changepage) on pagecreate succeeds, but I get the same problem 'freeze' on close.
[10:28:45] <cordovafan8> do I need preventDefault and/or setTimeout for the dialog creation?
[10:29:11] <Omar-> cordovafan8 have you tried the solutions? or arschmitz's one?
[10:29:38] <Omar-> cordovafan8 pagecreate of what? the dialog? or the first page in your app (DOM);
[10:30:22] <cordovafan8> the first page of the app.
[10:30:52] <cordovafan8> I was trying the stackoverflow solution, but the pagebeforechange can't be bound, and the pagecreate doesn't have data.toPage I think
[10:30:54] <Omar-> cordovafan8 it's better to listen to pagebeforechange since it triggers before pagebeforecreate
[10:31:13] <Omar-> cordovafan8 you dont need to bind it
[10:31:35] <Omar-> if(typeof data.toPage == "object" && typeof data.absUrl == "undefined" && !condition) { this means the first run/startup
[10:32:03] <Omar-> toPage is an object and absUrl is undefined == on start up
[10:32:13] <cordovafan8> Omar-: but the pagebeforechange listener will run on each pageload though
[10:32:17] <cordovafan8> even if it won't do anything?
[10:32:59] <Omar-> yup it will
[10:33:08] <Omar-> that's why mobileinit is another solution
[10:33:39] <Omar-> cordovafan8 http://plnkr.co/edit/ik7oz5tWsl2IWMWF5Df4?p=preview
[10:33:59] <Omar-> btw, are you using SPM or MPM?
[10:34:08] <Omar-> single page model or multi-page model?
[10:34:22] <cordovafan8> multi
[10:34:33] <cordovafan8> the disclaimer is a different html
[10:34:34] <Omar-> cordovafan8 https://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/redirect-on-start-up/
[10:34:39] <cordovafan8> which is part of why this is so hard, heh
[10:34:46] <Omar-> you mean dialog.html?
[10:34:55] <Omar-> or a div within same index.html?
[10:35:33] <Omar-> cordovafan8 i'm leaving now
[10:35:40] <Omar-> i'll try to catch on you later
[10:35:55] <Omar-> cordovafan8 arschmitz will assist you
[10:35:57] <cordovafan8> Omar-: thanks for your help man, I will try your suggestions
[10:36:05] <Omar-> you're welcome cordovafan8 :)
[10:36:10] <cordovafan8> :)
[10:36:49] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: sorry i'm only half paying attention ping me if you need something i'm likely not actually looking in here.
[10:36:49] <cordovafan8> to answer your question, my dialog is in disclaimer.html (as div data-role="dialog" and is the only div in body)
[10:37:10] <Omar-> then you're using a "single page model"
[10:37:20] <cordovafan8> Omar-: oh jeepers, you're right
[10:37:33] <cordovafan8> I meant that I had mutliple htmls, but you're right duh
[10:37:56] <Omar-> pre-fetch it as arschmitz
[10:37:59] <Omar-> said
[10:38:01] <Omar-> $( document ).on( "mobileinit", function() {
[10:38:01] <Omar->   $.mobile.autoInitializePage = false;
[10:38:01] <Omar->   if ( condition ) {
[10:38:01] <Omar->     $(function() {
[10:38:01] <Omar->       $("body").load("login.html [data-role=page]", function(data) {
[10:38:02] <Omar->         $.mobile.initializePage();
[10:38:02] <Omar->       });
[10:38:03] <Omar->     });
[10:38:03] <Omar->   }
[10:38:04] <Omar-> });
[10:38:06] <robertmaxrees> woah
[10:38:12] <Omar-> sorry
[10:38:13] <Omar-> :/
[10:38:14] <robertmaxrees> careful there :)
[10:38:26] <Omar-> [data-role=dialog] instead of [data-role=page]
[10:38:43] <Omar-> laters!
[10:38:49] <cordovafan8> I'll give it a shot, thanks!
[10:53:20] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: so I am prefetching the page I want to popup as the dialog. This displays fine, but loading the main page afterwards (via mobile.changepage) breaks some things. Is it possible to load the main page behind the dialog, so I don't have to load it after the dialog?
[10:53:53] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: what do you mean "behind"
[10:54:04] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: a dialog is a page
[10:54:08] <cordovafan8> also I have to figure out how to get the transitions back
[10:54:14] <arschmitz> it just has slightly different history handling and style
[10:54:35] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: what you want is to prefetch the page though not the dialog
[10:54:45] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I guess I mean load them simultaneously, so that when I dismiss the dialog, the main page doesn't have to be loaded? Is this possible?
[10:54:56] <cordovafan8> ah
[10:55:01] <arschmitz> yes thats what pre-fetching does
[10:55:09] <arschmitz> it puts them both in the dom at the same time
[10:56:29] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I think I must have misread Omar- 's example above then, it appeared he was saying to prefetch only the dialog.
[10:57:54] <cordovafan8> OMG IT WORKS YOU ARE A GOD AMONG MEN
[10:58:40] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: No problem it does help i run the project so i have a pretty good idea what works and does not :-)
[10:59:27] <cordovafan8> OMG THIS FIXES 5 other bugs
[10:59:29] <cordovafan8> lol
[10:59:52] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: awesome glad to help
[10:59:55] <cordovafan8> if this works on my device I'm going to do a dance
[11:05:51] <Sal> i have many multi-paged lists in a one page app. whats the best way to keep each page counter?
[11:06:11] <Sal> writing it on every page jeader element?
[11:06:44] <Sal> or, make a query on counting the list childrens?
[11:07:02] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:07:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to handle pagination?
[11:07:14] <Sal> i have it
[11:07:31] <Sal> but i just found out that i have 1 page counter for all lists
[11:07:52] <Sal> so when 1 list gets to pafe 2, when i switch to anothe rlists, it starts on page 3
[11:08:17] <Sal> si i need to keep a page counter for every list
[11:08:25] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: can you foresee any reason calling this prefetching AFTER mobileinit bind would be a problem? Since I'm using cordova I need to defer most page functionality until after deviceready as well.
[11:08:37] <Sal> just wondering what could be the best way to keep them all
[11:08:43] <Sal> maybe an associative array?
[11:08:44] <robertmaxrees> Sal without seeing an example of your code, it's really hard to understand what problem you're having.
[11:09:22] <Sal> robertmaxrees, its not a jquery problem, so there's really nothing to see
[11:09:42] <Sal> i'm just asking what could be the best way to keep many page counters
[11:09:43] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to maintain state for each paginated list so you know what page each one is on, i'd add a data-attribute to it that has the current page number, or store state somewhere else and tie that state back to the list somehow.
[11:09:52] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: um in a cordova app im not 100% sure
[11:10:13] <arschmitz> in the browser you want it because if someone refreshes you want to skip the dialog
[11:10:17] <robertmaxrees> Sal the nice thing about the latter solution is it's a little more robust, but it might be overkill for waht you're trying to accomplish.,
[11:10:20] <arschmitz> and so the new page has to be there
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: would it be possible to combine them into a single file?
[11:11:03] <Sal> robertmaxrees, so, a data attr on each list header element would be the best?
[11:11:03] <arschmitz> with 2 pages in the body?
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> Sal not on the header, no.
[11:11:20] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: yes, but I've tried that a few times now with no success
[11:11:26] <robertmaxrees> Sal i'd do it on the wrapper for the list.
[11:11:29] <cordovafan8> maybe I'm just doing it wrong?
[11:11:32] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: put them both in a single page
[11:11:37] <arschmitz> make the dialog the FIRST page
[11:11:39] <Sal> yes, hreat
[11:11:41] <Sal> thanks
[11:12:08] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: make sure both pages have id's
[11:12:29] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: in mobileinit if the user is logged in already
[11:12:33] <robertmaxrees> Sal alternatively, use the plugin pattern and have that manage state for you instead.
[11:12:47] <arschmitz> $( "#dialogid" ).remove()
[11:13:04] <arschmitz> you dont even need to wait for mobile init actually
[11:13:32] <arschmitz> just a sec let me make a demo
[11:14:01] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: so I am already calling $.mobile.initializePage manually in my post-mobileinit prep-function.. anything I do MUST be in that function
[11:14:13] <arschmitz> ok thats fine
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> just do it there then
[11:14:49] <arschmitz> with cordova i HIGHLY recomend this approach
[11:15:07] <arschmitz> since your app has a single entry point
[11:15:25] <arschmitz> then you dont have to handle every single page change
[11:16:30] <baako> hi guys I am trying to remove the li long with the image wrap in it if the value in li data-id is no longer in the array. I have try it like this http://kopy.io/n3a75 but it doesn't seem to remove the image. I have done console.log on the selectors var and i habe notice [data-id='2'],[data-id='1']. The thing is my database is only selecting id which are active so if id 2 was to be inactive shouldn't the var statuses[] update the list? but instead it is
[11:16:30] <baako> still keeping all the id including the inactive id. How can I stop this?
[11:16:54] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: you mean for all pages, or just this dialog? I can't change from single pages to one big one at this point, I'm too far gone :P
[11:17:10] <arschmitz> just the dialog
[11:17:16] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: just a sec im making you a demo
[11:18:45] <cordovafan8> thanks :)
[11:19:06] <robertmaxrees> baako try .get() instead of .join(',') on that .map() call.
[11:19:30] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm
[11:19:51] <robertmaxrees> the array syntax is for an array of elements, not selectors.
[11:20:49] <robertmaxrees> baako this looks like a race condition to me.
[11:21:08] <baako> race?
[11:21:23] <robertmaxrees> the code after the $.get() call is running before it completes.
[11:21:33] <robertmaxrees> move that to after the $.each() call instead.
[11:24:16] <baako> robertmaxrees: i have move it between the .each and  var status = this.id; and still the id doesnt get removed
[11:24:34] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[11:24:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you popped it in the wrong place.
[11:25:55] <BlueProtoman> Hm...you know how when you press and hold a key, multiple keydown events are fired?  How can I prevent that?  (Possibly with JQuery)
[11:26:10] <robertmaxrees> baako wait woah sorry - my bad.  probably just confused you.
[11:27:48] <baako> robertmaxrees:
[11:27:49] <baako> http://kopy.io/BBy7i
[11:28:07] <robertmaxrees> baako sorry about that - i misread your code.  roll that back :)
[11:28:26] <baako> dont know if you know a bit of php but http://kopy.io/v0KHg i am select the id , etc only if the online_status is 1
[11:28:38] <baako> and if it is 0 it means they are offline which means it is not selected
[11:29:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm curious to see a copy of the data in question.
[11:29:07] <robertmaxrees> not the php that generates it.
[11:29:35] <baako> robertmaxrees: [data-id='2'],[data-id='1']
[11:29:43] <robertmaxrees> baako i mean the data from your backend.
[11:29:44] <robertmaxrees> not that.
[11:30:14] <baako> robertmaxrees: its just a mysql users table with columns and one of the columns name is online_statuc
[11:30:17] <baako> robertmaxrees: its just a mysql users table with columns and one of the columns name is online_status
[11:30:26] <baako> which get updated when the user sign in
[11:30:35] <baako> and get updated again when they sign out
[11:30:37] <robertmaxrees> baako great - that doesn't tell me what format the data is in when it gets returned to the browser.
[11:30:48] <baako> robertmaxrees: json
[11:31:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to build a functioning jsfiddle to play with.
[11:31:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why a copy of the data would be nice.
[11:31:20] <baako> you need my database?
[11:31:23] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:31:30] <robertmaxrees> the JSON that the $.get() call is getting.
[11:32:35] <baako> 0: {id:1, status:1}
[11:32:35] <baako> id: 1
[11:32:35] <baako> status: 1
[11:32:35] <baako> 1: {id:2, status:1}
[11:32:36] <baako> id: 2
[11:32:37] <baako> status: 1
[11:32:52] <baako> sorry guys
[11:32:56] <baako> robertmaxrees: [{"id":1,"status":1},{"id":2,"status":1}]
[11:33:08] <baako> id is the user id
[11:33:19] <baako> and the online status
[11:35:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/mhjwubxt/ this works.
[11:35:12] <robertmaxrees> are you sure .slideDown() is what you want?
[11:36:24] <krambiorix> hi, i have the name of a variable in a variable. How can i get the variable itself?    example: var v = "foo";     mydata = v -> this will be a string, I want it to be the variable foo
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix i'd make that the property on an object instead
[11:37:00] <baako> robertmaxrees: i just want to remove it from the broswer thought slidedown will do iy
[11:37:02] <baako> it
[11:37:24] <robertmaxrees> baako that's not what slideDown does.
[11:37:39] <robertmaxrees> compare my last fiddle with http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhjwubxt/1/
[11:37:48] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix is is possible for you to make that minor change>?
[11:38:49] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, nice idea!
[11:38:57] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: my windows machine is going to shut down because it's stupid. I will be right back.
[11:38:59] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix because then you can just do myObject[mydata]
[11:39:55] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yes indeed
[11:39:59] <krambiorix> good thinking!
[11:40:19] <[Non]> Hi
[11:40:28] <robertmaxrees> you can do the same thing with globals, but having dynamic global var names floating around is a little gross :)
[11:40:56] <[Non]> http://www.theinmancompany.com/portfolio.php is there anyone now
[11:41:08] <[Non]> these type of slider?
[11:41:13] <[Non]> im sure i was seen this
[11:41:23] <robertmaxrees> [Non] i don'
[11:41:36] <robertmaxrees> *don't see a carousel on that page.
[11:42:12] <[Non]> yeah but im asking if there is some plug in or something slides
[11:42:18] <[Non]> middle of this site, i want to slide them
[11:42:43] <robertmaxrees> [Non] bxslider is one choice, though i'd avoid using a carousel at all if possible.
[11:43:56] <cordovafan8> back :D
[11:49:53] <baako> robertmaxrees: doesnt seem to work for me
[11:50:00] <robertmaxrees> baako which one?
[11:50:18] <baako> .hide()
[11:50:20] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/mhjwubxt/
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> what do you see in the result area?
[11:50:47] <baako> nothing
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> do you see the list item that says "I should go away"?
[11:51:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhjwubxt/2/ what about this?
[11:54:56] <baako> robertmaxrees: try adding it in a function and do this http://jsfiddle.net/mhjwubxt/3/
[11:55:15] <baako> because that is how i am doing it and see if  it works
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> err, fix the syntax error first.
[11:56:25] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhjwubxt/4/ - this works.
[11:56:47] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/mhjwubxt/5/
[11:57:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, those both work just fine.
[11:57:34] <robertmaxrees> without a 404'd image - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhjwubxt/6/
[11:57:36] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, thanks that worked (putting it in an object)
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix fsho.
[11:58:29] <baako> robertmaxrees: try changing 15 to 1 and 1 to 15
[11:58:31] <baako> dont work
[11:58:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:58:56] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/mhjwubxt/7/
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> that works for me.
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> after one second, the existing <li> goes away and the other ones show up.
[12:04:40] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/UNL9k dont work for me the image is still then. when setInterval it should remove offline user but it dont
[12:04:56] <robertmaxrees> baako in the fiddle or on your site?
[12:05:09] <baako> site
[12:05:15] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[12:05:20] <baako> nope
[12:05:24] <robertmaxrees> have you tried using a debugger or anything?
[12:05:32] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the error there's not really much i can do.
[12:06:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhjwubxt/8/
[12:06:03] <beasty_> did you overide the window.console ? perhaps?
[12:06:06] <baako> robertmaxrees: debugger like what? am console logging everything
[12:06:21] <robertmaxrees> try something like this instead - just do a wholesale replacement of that container.
[12:06:35] <robertmaxrees> baako your browser has a debugger for javascript - you can step through code and watch it execute.
[12:07:12] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[12:07:15] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: you still here sorry got pulled away
[12:07:25] <robertmaxrees> Hi arthurvr :)
[12:07:37] <arthurvr> Hi robertmaxrees! How’s your day going?
[12:08:01] <robertmaxrees> pretty well.  recovering from my weekend in Vegas.  yours?
[12:08:47] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: all going well :)
[12:27:53] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: yep, but I fixed almost all my problems with your idea already :D
[12:28:15] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: http://jsbin.com/qokeje/4/
[12:28:18] <cordovafan8> if you made a demo, I would still love to see it though, just in case I did it wrong
[12:28:21] <cordovafan8> nice, thanks!
[12:28:23] <arschmitz> that will work for every edge case
[12:28:56] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: to simulate "loggedin"
[12:29:05] <arschmitz> it just using ?loggedin in the url
[12:29:18] <arschmitz> you could replace the logic there with however your tracking yoru user sessions
[12:29:29] <cordovafan8> cool.
[12:30:07] <cordovafan8> I will review this before I submit my build
[12:30:39] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: it has two pages but everything is basicly faked so jqm only ever sees one page
[12:30:42] <cordovafan8> but I ended up not using the prefetching, but just stuffing the disclaimer in my main page as the first div (dialog role), then calling dialog.close and a remove() in a settimeout
[12:31:02] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: yeah this avoids the need for setTimeouts and stuff
[12:31:19] <cordovafan8> cool, I'll take a peek :D
[12:31:30] <cordovafan8> thanks a lot for your time  man
[12:31:33] <cordovafan8> I spent 3 days on this
[12:31:39] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: no problem
[12:36:36] <[Non]> http://www.theinmancompany.com/portfolio.php is there plugin? that site's middle image thumbnails slider version?
[12:36:45] <[Non]> like when you clicked one, other will be pushed
[12:37:01] <robertmaxrees> [Non] not sure what you're asking.
[12:37:46] <[Non]> are you seeing that pages middle images?
[12:37:49] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:37:53] <[Non]> traditional etc..
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:38:19] <[Non]> yes, now think like this, if i go to click traditional will be opened to left and image will be full screen or whatever
[12:38:30] <[Non]> i was seeing this im sure of it! but i dont know what they called
[12:39:03] <robertmaxrees> horizontal expand on click.
[12:39:34] <[Non]> accordion
[12:39:35] <[Non]> yes!!
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> that's one, yeah.
[12:42:01] <[Non]> thanks
[12:56:48] <cordovafan8> if I have a page in the dom #page, and I modify the contents and haven't stored the originals, how can I set it back to the original?
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> you can't.  you have to store the original stuff somewhere.
[12:57:25] <cordovafan8> basically a page refresh, but where you have multiple data-role="page" on the same html
[12:57:43] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: really? I can do it with location.reload(), but it flashes a white screen, which is annoying
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> oh for JQM?  something tells me it's the same answer, but no clue.
[12:57:57] <cordovafan8> yeah jqm, sorry
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> the original state doesn't get stored anywhere afaik.  you have to explicitly do it.
[12:59:35] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: it's in the files
[12:59:55] <robertmaxrees> once the browser loads them, that part is a little less relevant.
[13:00:38] <robertmaxrees> you can't really ask the browser "hey get me the little bit that was originally in the file".  you could try to load a minimal fragment of just the thing you care about/.
[13:01:11] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: it should like you should detach() what ever it is you need to store
[13:01:16] <arschmitz> and save refrence in a variable
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> that's a good idea.
[13:01:30] <arschmitz> and then put it back when ever you need it if thats what your really want
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> i always forget about .detach()
[13:02:03] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: yeah gotta be careful with it dont want to leave tons do detached DOM lying around.
[13:02:17] <cordovafan8> I'm just after a fresh page refresh basically. I don't particularly care about the state so much.
[13:02:20] <arschmitz> espically in a JQM single page app
[13:02:47] <arschmitz> if you want a refresh then you really need to ... refresh lol
[13:03:12] <arschmitz> otherwise everything is going to save state and be left around
[13:04:01] <cordovafan8> ok, I guess I can live with location.reload() for now
[13:04:08] <krambiorix> does anyone use jquery flot/plot here to show graphs?
[13:09:29] <OnceMe> How can I avoid appending text with html tags
[13:09:47] <OnceMe> so append(text); where text is "<strong>tyets</strong>"
[13:10:01] <OnceMe> it bolt's tyets and I want to append it exactly how it is with tags.
[13:10:04] <OnceMe> bolds*
[13:13:02] <mirko> probably that's a dumb question but i just don't get it: why is the ajax-call by default transforming data into this http-form-syntax?
[13:13:10] <mirko> i mean, JSON is fine - why not transfer json?
[13:24:39] <_DB> sup guys how can I "["index","add","edit","delete"]"  turn this into a array?
[13:25:57] <zeroquake> stoing reference information to some data by using their array index ? what do you guys think ?
[13:29:00] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: So one thing I just noticed is that having the dialog as the first div, it seems to ignore data-history="false" ?
[13:29:23] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: yes
[13:29:35] <arschmitz> the first page MUST have a history entry
[13:29:35] <cordovafan8> is there a way around that?
[13:29:45] <cordovafan8> balls
[13:29:56] <arschmitz> yes use the jsbin i liked to because then you are replacing the first page content
[13:30:05] <arschmitz> so you dont have to worry about the history
[13:32:45] <cordovafan8> I've got to read it closely, so I'll have to do it later
[13:48:27] <TuxBrother> Is advanced positioning in a webpage while keeping the positions while resizing?
[13:48:41] <TuxBrother> a thing for jQuery?
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> TuxBrother have an example?
[13:52:30] <TuxBrother> robertmaxrees: Yes, wait a moment
[13:55:33] <TuxBrother> robertmaxrees: Are you here tomorrow?
[13:55:44] <robertmaxrees> i can't make guarantees :)
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> generally, yeah.  along with lots of other folks.
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like what you want is for stuff to stay in a single spot on a page.
[14:01:01] <TuxBrother> robertmaxrees: I can't get it online now, here is a screenshot: http://testomgeving.gehostvoorklanten.nl/example.png
[14:01:48] <TuxBrother> It was hard to get these in position using CSS
[14:02:09] <TuxBrother> And when I did a bit of resizing (responsiveness), it got all screwed up
[14:02:34] <TuxBrother> I bet there are better ways to do that, right?
[14:05:58] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what exactly you're trying to do.
[14:06:02] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be excellent,
[14:07:01] <lbracher> Hi there! I need to center a div with background image on screen and pops it out. I tried popup overlay plugin, but it only worked on FF and also tried jqueryui position, without success. Do you know how to do that? Thanks in advance!
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> lbracher are you looking for a modal?
[14:09:38] <lbracher> robertmaxrees: yes, I could accomodate that on a modal
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> lbracher i'm not sure what you're looking for that's different from a modal.
[14:10:52] <robertmaxrees> is it that you're looking for a background that isn't a simple alpha-transparency dealio?
[14:11:31] <lbracher> robertmaxrees, I just need to popup a div with an image on background that will show centered on FF, IE and Chrome. The image is ready, I can put an alpha outside the image as well.
[14:12:27] <robertmaxrees> jqmodal is a personal favorite.  popup overlay sounds like it works, you just need to fix the problem with it.
[14:12:34] <robertmaxrees> lots of modal plugins/libs out there.
[14:13:30] <lbracher> robertmaxrees, I'll give a look. Thank you! :)
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> my guess is that you mad a minor css problem that broke the other plugin you were trying to use.
[14:15:22] <Webchat-user> Has cordovafan8 left?
[14:15:46] <baako> why is this crap not working has it is intended to? http://kopy.io/UNL9k
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> baako i gave you the solution earlier.
[14:16:14] <baako> is .get not working has it is might to?
[14:16:30] <baako> worked on jsflidder but not on this web app
[14:16:48] <robertmaxrees> baako we have no way of knowing - have you checked the network tab in your dev tools to make sure things are working fine on that front?
[14:20:12] <baako> robertmaxrees: no error
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> console.log() out the returned data inside that $.get() callback, first thing.
[14:34:00] <baako> robertmaxrees: you mean the "data" in the function here  $.get('{{ URL::route("current-online-users")}}', function (data) {
[14:34:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.  the returned data.
[14:35:44] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://postimg.org/image/d29bsan8r/#
[14:35:57] <t0astt> what would be the most efficient way to select a table row based on it's data-id attribute?
[14:36:26] <robertmaxrees> baako try console.log(JSON.stringify(data)); and toss out the data here.
[14:36:31] <robertmaxrees> t0astt by not doing it at all :)
[14:36:33] <robertmaxrees> for .filter() for it.
[14:37:21] <baako> robertmaxrees: [{"id":1,"status":1}]
[14:38:04] <t0astt> Thanks robertmaxrees
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> t0astt start with a subset of elements and do a .filter() or a .find() or something.
[14:41:24] <baako> is it my jquery version robertmaxrees
[14:41:30] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/pbbhH/879/ Could someone please help me figure out so that after I pick an item from the auto select that it submits the form? But it needs to direct to store_locator?VALUE_OF_zipcode ?
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> a straight up $('[data-id="somevalue"]') is slow.
[14:41:36] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: How about this? They say it's a better way than .filter http://stackoverflow.com/a/13623261
[14:41:47] <t0astt> ah you beat me to it
[14:42:00] <robertmaxrees> baako in the fiddle pls.
[14:42:01] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:46:19] <baako> http://postimg.org/image/yljvjo9h7/ robertmaxrees
[14:46:46] <robertmaxrees> something seems off here.
[14:47:02] <baako> yellow is the web broswer, blue is the console log and red is mysql database status field
[14:47:21] <baako> the is one user online 1
[14:47:28] <baako> it is shown on the console log
[14:47:31] <robertmaxrees> by "off" i mean "i'm not getting the full picture from you"
[14:47:38] <robertmaxrees> i gave you the fix to this earlier.
[14:47:47] <baako> but on the web broswer is is still showing 2 when it should be 1
[14:47:49] <robertmaxrees> but it seems like the goalposts keep moving.
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> then you're selecting something incorrectly or something else is off.
[14:48:22] <baako> i am doing select id, status from users where status = 1
[14:48:33] <baako> i am only selecting users that are online
[14:48:37] <robertmaxrees> baako the javascript doesn't care what the backend says.
[14:48:50] <robertmaxrees> rather, it only cares what data gets returned.
[14:48:53] <baako> which means when the status is set to 0 it will not be in the json anymore
[14:49:20] <robertmaxrees> the specifics of what the sql is doing is sort of irrelevant.  i know exactly what you're trying to accomplish and have given you a functioning example.
[14:49:43] <baako> robertmaxrees: has you can see in the red circle. the json data only contain the online user
[14:49:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that you've got a bad selector somewhere.  i'd hit up fixingthesejquery.com if i were you.
[14:49:56] <baako> so what did you by i am selecting something wrong?
[14:50:07] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/pbbhH/880/ Here we go this one has the autocomplete working. Just need to figure out how to get the zip varible so that on select it posts to the url?zipcode
[14:50:34] <robertmaxrees> baako if the data is right and the UI is wrong, it's something between those two parts.  pop open your debugger and start stepping :)
[15:07:56] <mvpgraff> So is there an open issue with jquery-ui and chrome on draggable/droppable? My items are overlapping on the page load, but will fix it self if I move an item. It works fine in all other browsers except for chrome.
[15:08:37] <robertmaxrees> mvpgraff i'd ask in #jquery-dev
[15:08:41] <robertmaxrees> or search in github
[15:20:12] <frabblerock> can anyone here help me with grunt
[15:22:17] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock you can try, might have more luck elsewhere though :)
[15:23:36] <frabblerock> [1/26/15, 6:22:00 PM] Brett Frable: http://jsbin.com/fetiki/2/edit?html,css,js
[15:23:36] <frabblerock> [1/26/15, 6:22:24 PM] Brett Frable: My grunt file keeps concatenating font awesome into the main.css file
[15:23:36] <frabblerock> [1/26/15, 6:22:29 PM] Brett Frable: can’t figure out why
[15:23:36] <frabblerock> [1/26/15, 6:22:40 PM] Brett Frable: its throwing errors for me.
[15:23:38] <frabblerock> [1/26/15, 6:23:27 PM] Brett Frable: it’s hosted on a cdn, so i obviously don’t want it also in the main.css file
[15:24:03] <robertmaxrees> careful with the spam there :)
[15:24:21] <frabblerock> sorry
[15:24:47] <robertmaxrees> have you tried in #Node.js btw?
[16:08:01] <lbracher> robertmaxrees, bPopup solved the issue. Thank you anyway! :)
[16:08:07] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[16:31:47] <OnceMe> how can I find closest element in a box?
[16:32:27] <OnceMe> I have 10 box1 classes on page, and inside each box1 I have class: supertip, and so 3 supertip classes inside each box1, so 30 supertip's in total
[16:32:38] <OnceMe> I dont know how on click to call only clicked supertip class
[16:32:39] <OnceMe> any idea?
[16:34:23] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe you asked like two questions :)
[16:34:29] <OnceMe> ?
[16:34:32] <OnceMe> Thats one question :D
[16:34:36] <buzzlewoo> hello!
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> " how can I find closest element in a box?" and then "I dont know how on click to call only clicked supertip class"
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> could you show an example maybe?
[16:35:30] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/wLgPVAbU
[16:36:19] <OnceMe> I set handle on osomeclickingthing 'click' function event  { $this = this; $box.closest('.box1').find('someclickignthing'); }
[16:36:29] <OnceMe> that usually should work but only when I have only one someclickingthing
[16:36:34] <OnceMe> now I have three of them and got issues ;(
[16:36:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find all .someclickingthing elements inside the box?
[16:37:25] <OnceMe> no
[16:37:28] <OnceMe> only clicked one
[16:37:33] <OnceMe> thats my issue ;(
[16:37:39] <OnceMe> and on click I show textbox
[16:37:57] <OnceMe> but textbox got showed for all someclcikingthing in box1
[16:38:00] <OnceMe> other boxes are fine
[16:38:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L1366mcm/1/ ?
[16:39:51] <OnceMe> hmm
[16:39:57] <OnceMe> maybe because I was trying to append textarea
[16:39:59] <OnceMe> and not class
[16:39:59] <OnceMe> ?
[16:40:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L1366mcm/2/
[16:40:30] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter.
[16:40:52] <robertmaxrees> your .closest('.box1').find('someclickignthing'); example from earlier doesn't really make much sense.
[16:41:02] <OnceMe> yeah but
[16:41:06] <OnceMe> I have other button
[16:41:16] <OnceMe> maybe my example is not good
[16:41:18] <OnceMe> let me think
[16:41:36] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to append to all .someclickingthing elements?
[16:41:41] <OnceMe> no
[16:41:56] <OnceMe> the thing is, I have separate clicking link
[16:42:05] <OnceMe> such as <div class="clickme">Click</div>
[16:42:18] <OnceMe> and other <div class="hiddendiv appendhere"></div>
[16:42:29] <OnceMe> so when you click on Click it appends to appendhere
[16:42:31] <OnceMe> which is hidden div
[16:43:04] <robertmaxrees> so you want to append .someclickingthing to the hidden div?
[16:43:16] <OnceMe> yes
[16:43:20] <OnceMe> wait
[16:43:34] <OnceMe> I use delegate
[16:43:37] <OnceMe> is that bad?
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> it's deprecated, but should work fine.
[16:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm still not sure what the actual issue is.
[16:44:13] <robertmaxrees> are you having trouble getting the clicked elemenmt?
[16:44:43] <OnceMe> can I somehow trace what elements are clicked etc?
[16:44:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L1366mcm/3/
[16:45:02] <robertmaxrees> the $(this) object is the clicked element.
[16:45:10] <robertmaxrees> my example there uses the delegated syntax of .on()
[16:45:17] <robertmaxrees> which you should be using instead of .delegate
[16:48:19] <OnceMe> it does not work huh
[16:48:43] <robertmaxrees> wjhat version of jquery are you using?
[16:49:14] <OnceMe> 11.2
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid version.
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.2?
[16:50:03] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: Hey, you around? I am struggling to understand your jsbin. I am a jqm noob.
[16:51:04] <OnceMe> yes
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe can you create a functioning fiddle of your issue then?
[16:53:52] <OnceMe> nvm
[16:53:55] <OnceMe> I solved it finally
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[16:54:03] <OnceMe> I had to open chrome console and check dom
[16:54:09] <guideX> how do I always show an ajax loader during page change, or ajax event, without doing it myself everytime
[16:54:11] <OnceMe> I was having a wrong elements in closest
[16:54:20] <OnceMe> my dom is very complex so is not that easy to form jsfiddle
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe okay.
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> guideX create a function that you call to handle those things for you.
[16:55:07] <guideX> robertmaxrees: yeah but, I want it to automagically show the loader without me programming it in everytime
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> that's why you make convenience functions for that.
[16:55:25] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees:how to I check if I clicked on link
[16:55:29] <guideX> I know I can use ajaxStart(function, but what about when I move to a new page?
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe that doesn't make sense.
[16:55:33] <guideX> don't want to micromanage it
[16:55:44] <OnceMe> because now I just append textarea and show it on click
[16:55:48] <OnceMe> so div is displayed.
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> guideX you can check this out: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> but i'd highly suggest avoiding it and creating convenience methods instead.
[16:56:36] <robertmaxrees> or creating your own plugin that you call instead of jquery directly.
[16:56:43] <guideX> oh intersting
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe your question doesn't make sense.  you bind an event listener and it fires - that's how you check.
[16:57:05] <OnceMe> toggle worked
[16:57:05] <OnceMe> :D
[18:02:47] <cuppy> How do I add a variable in a selector again? Somthing like $("#mydiv[myvar]") ?
[18:04:19] <systemfault> String concatenation.
[18:28:36] <kevireilly> cuppy: IE: $("#mydiv[" + myVar + "]");
[18:29:17] <ExtraSteve> I love jquery
[18:29:24] <ExtraSteve> I just want everyone to know that
[18:29:28] <ExtraSteve> That is all.
[18:30:52] <OnceMe> cool story bro
[18:31:15] <ExtraSteve> :)
[18:33:00] <kevireilly> and jQuery loves you, ExtraSteve ;)
[18:42:09] <ExtraSteve> kevireilly: :)

[20:47:47] <satio> hey there i need some help
[20:47:48] <satio> http://jsfiddle.net/cxh2ttbw/
[20:47:59] <satio> i function not running at first time
[20:48:07] <satio> hw can i do that
[20:50:59] <satio> drag the user voice mail device any thing you want
[20:51:23] <satio> and add to the voicamil admin admin
[20:51:27] <satio> see that
[20:52:15] <satio> hey there i need some help
[20:52:17] <satio> satio	http://jsfiddle.net/cxh2ttbw/
[20:52:18] <satio> my function not running at first time
[20:52:20] <satio> satio	hw can i do that
[20:52:21] <satio> satio	drag the user voice mail device any thing you want
[20:52:23] <satio> satio	and add to the voicamil admin admin
[20:52:24] <satio> satio	see that
[20:52:41] <DanKnox> what are you hoping it will do?
[20:53:10] <satio> on first time i want to make my functio
[20:53:14] <satio> work
[20:53:21] <satio> bit it's not
[20:53:34] <satio> on second time it's work
[20:54:24] <DanKnox> i see
[20:54:42] <satio> i don't know what's the problem
[20:55:04] <satio> i tried to find but i can't find
[20:55:34] <DanKnox> on a side note... in the future it may be helpful to name variables something meaningful instead of "f", "j", "co", "foo"
[20:55:49] <DanKnox> and why does call = 2 ?
[20:55:53] <satio> yeah sure why not
[20:56:05] <satio> i want to start id with 2
[20:57:42] <DanKnox> when you call $("#cart").droppable you are activating it as an element that can receive dropped items
[20:57:54] <satio> yes
[20:57:56] <DanKnox> so the first time the drago function is called it sets up the drop area
[20:58:01] <DanKnox> then the second time it actually works
[20:58:26] <satio> but i want to work at first time
[20:59:21] <DanKnox> yeah so you need to move the $("#cart").droppable({options}) outside of the drago function
[20:59:40] <satio> are you sure it's work
[21:02:40] <satio> Danknox will you do it in my fiddle
[21:03:23] <DanKnox> sure
[21:03:42] <satio> hope it's work
[21:12:17] <DanKnox> am i missing something or is the drago1 function identical to drago except it calls itself recursively?
[21:12:30] <satio> yes
[21:13:14] <satio> i am design drago function for dropping on cart
[21:13:24] <satio> and drogo1 for ol in li
[21:13:29] <satio> clear
[21:13:33] <DanKnox> so you plan to change it later?
[21:13:46] <satio> no i can't change
[21:14:01] <DanKnox> you can reuse the same function for dropping
[21:14:06] <satio> yes
[21:14:16] <satio> and it's work
[21:17:33] <DanKnox> it appears as though you can't have a droppable within a droppable
[21:17:57] <DanKnox> http://jsfiddle.net/Lzsmzxvg/
[21:18:18] <DanKnox> though your code is a bit messy so i didn't really spend too much time figuring out what your intent was
[21:18:58] <satio> DanKnox it's complete
[21:19:01] <satio> http://jsfiddle.net/cxh2ttbw/1/
[21:19:28] <DanKnox> that's all you wanted?
[21:19:45] <DanKnox> you don't want them to be able to drag in to the main cart as well?
[21:20:32] <DarkGhost> hello all, quick question: I was working on an app a little bit ago and tried using .setup for ajax calls and sending an Authorization header or whatever.. but it didn't send for all my ajax calls any ideas why?
[21:23:25] <satio> oooh no problem thanks for help
[21:23:26] <satio> it's helpfull
[21:23:41] <DanKnox> no problem... sorry i misunderstood
[22:13:48] <satio> how to find the last li id of ol
[22:14:03] <satio> $("#cart ol:first").find("li").length;
[22:14:10] <satio> is it a right function
[22:14:33] <arthurvr> that’s going to get the amount of elements in that selection, not the selection itself
[22:14:40] <arthurvr> that’s what `.length` does
[22:16:03] <satio> find the linght of li
[22:16:12] <satio> sorry length of li
[22:16:40] <arthurvr> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/hon18ut7/
[22:17:12] <arthurvr> but length outputs the amount of elements you selected: http://jsfiddle.net/hon18ut7/1/
[22:17:57] <satio> but i need the last  li id value
[22:18:13] <satio> $("#cart ol").last().find("li").prop("id");
[22:18:46] <arthurvr> that selects all li’s in the last ol
[22:19:11] <arthurvr> but .prop(‘id’) works fine
[22:19:32] <satio> instead of ("id")
[22:19:56] <arthurvr> what do you mean? That’s like… exactly the same
[22:20:13] <satio> 	$("#cart ol").last().find("li").prop('id');
[22:20:15] <Uhkis> attr, not prop
[22:20:23] <satio> ok
[22:21:00] <Uhkis> $('#cart ol > li:last-child').att('id'); should work fine too
[22:21:11] <Uhkis> attr*
[22:22:04] <arthurvr> prop() works perfectly fine in this case
[22:23:58] <Uhkis> id is not a property, it's an attribute so attr should be used
[22:26:41] <satio> http://jsfiddle.net/cxh2ttbw/2/
[22:26:49] <satio> $("#cart ol:first").find("li").length;
[22:26:57] <satio> it's wirk fine in my iddle
[22:27:08] <satio> Uhkis
[23:14:16] <satio> http://jsfiddle.net/cxh2ttbw/
[23:14:26] <satio> function is not running at first time
[23:15:58] <satio> on second time it's work fine
