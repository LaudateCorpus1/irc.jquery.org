[00:04:21] <bobdobbs> I'm having an issue with getJSON. I have this code fragment working: http://pastebin.com/qS2c7Q3D
[00:05:25] <bobdobbs> I want to dump the response to console so that I can inspect it. But console reports:  "[object Object]"
[00:05:40] <bobdobbs> And that's a string. I can't click on it to inspect anything
[00:05:48] <bobdobbs> but if I
[00:06:17] <bobdobbs> If I just paste in the value of req into my browser navigation bar, I get back a json object.
[00:06:31] <bobdobbs> So, I'm certain that req is a valid request
[00:34:14] <bobdobbs> I've rewritten that function: http://pastebin.com/Qy1R6NrD
[00:37:11] <bobdobbs> but I'm getting pretty much the same result: the string [Object object]. No actual object is being produced.
[00:38:59] <bobdobbs> I get the same result for $.get as well
[00:41:03] <bobdobbs> So, how do I get the actual response data from a jquery ajax request?
[00:56:47] <developerme> hey I need a help in hiding effects in Jquery
[00:57:23] <developerme> i need a div to be hidden like it drops down
[00:58:08] <developerme> i trided ('#id').hide('drop') but it didn't work
[00:58:17] <developerme> any advice?
[00:59:17] <bobdobbs> 'drop' isn't a possible for hide
[00:59:19] <arc_> that's some patience
[00:59:29] <arc_> he quit
[00:59:37] <bobdobbs> heh
[00:59:44] <bobdobbs> maybe his irc client died
[01:00:22] <arc_> webirc, he may have accidentally closed the tab i guess
[01:13:46] <bobdobbs> is it a bad idea to store html inside a data attribute?
[01:14:06] <bobdobbs> It feels kinda wrong. And miight break the dom
[01:15:34] <arc_> seems like a pretty bad idea
[01:16:12] <amincd> Hi, a very beginner question: I'm dynamically adding an element to my page, and the class styling is not being applied for some reason. I am doing something wrong?
[01:16:33] <amincd> *Am I
[01:18:14] <bobdobbs> amincd:
[01:18:36] <bobdobbs> amincd: are you familiar with your browsers debugging tools?
[01:18:42] <amincd> yes
[01:18:45] <bobdobbs> k
[01:19:16] <bobdobbs> there's no reason why an injected element shouldn't have styles applied. chances are that it's a minor bug in your stylesheet.
[01:19:21] <arc_> it should work. typo in class name?
[01:21:14] <amincd> Ok, I'm going to test a couple things
[01:23:06] <amincd> yeah, the injected element definitely doesn't have styles injected. All of the other CSS on my page works
[01:23:45] <arc_> try manually creating an element to which the styles should be applied
[01:25:10] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/sLhwwgod/ i mean you can see for yourself here, it works in theory
[01:25:25] <amincd> K
[01:25:35] <arc_> without being able to look at your code we can't really go any further
[01:27:35] <amincd> arc_: my code is top secret
[01:27:49] <amincd> joking, it's actually too big to paste
[01:28:01] <arc_> k
[01:29:32] <amincd> I'm trying to add a styled table to the encrypted results. This is the source code: https://github.com/Amincd/passencrypt
[01:30:17] <amincd> The table would be defined here: https://github.com/Amincd/passencrypt/blob/master/formulate.php
[01:33:01] <amincd> The CSS is here:
[01:33:02] <amincd> https://github.com/Amincd/passencrypt/blob/master/default.php
[01:33:03] <arc_> well you were right about it being too big
[01:33:34] <amincd> yea..
[01:40:51] <amincd> thanks for the help. I'll give it another try later
[02:11:01] <hellyeah> yo
[02:11:16] <hellyeah> so beforeShownDay expect an array to return
[02:42:15] <HeavenSucks> how can I define $('body').delegate once and use it more
[02:59:06] <hellyeah> hey anyone here
[03:01:40] <DirtyFinn> jep
[03:04:34] <hellyeah> please check line 23 i try to get datae value from datepicker. Let me tell what my aim is. You can create datepickers as many you want. For example you select 21  Jan and 26 Jan in the datepickers. And you create new one i want to see 21,22,23,24,25,26 disabled in the datepicker you create. How can i do that?
[03:04:37] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/30/
[03:05:41] <hellyeah> do you know anything about it?
[03:05:54] <DirtyFinn> i hate datepickers :)
[03:05:59] <DirtyFinn> let me see
[03:06:13] <hellyeah> :XD
[03:07:54] <DirtyFinn> so you want to create datepickers dynamically
[03:08:33] <hellyeah> yes
[03:08:44] <hellyeah> when you click create button
[03:08:50] <DirtyFinn> ah yes
[03:08:54] <DirtyFinn> I see the problem
[03:09:02] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:09:38] <hellyeah> what is the problem?
[03:11:33] <hellyeah> HeavenSucks: hang out with this https://jsfiddle.net/4og1sebu/6/
[03:12:01] <DirtyFinn> so you have the "default" input fields (.from and .to) for datepickers and that works fine. but then you add another set of input fields with the same class names. the problem is your code doesn't understand which field it should read and so it might read wrong field [to be continued...]
[03:12:49] <DirtyFinn> [...continuing] when you have two .from fields, which one is var start (line 93) reading?
[03:12:50] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:13:50] <hellyeah> well there is each there
[03:14:11] <hellyeah> and i used this when in each "each" it will read current datepicker i guess
[03:14:33] <DirtyFinn> but yuo need the values from previous one?
[03:14:38] <DirtyFinn> *you
[03:15:07] <hellyeah> i am not using that function yer actually problem is in line 23
[03:15:12] <hellyeah> beforeShownDay
[03:15:42] <hellyeah> if you take a look line 37
[03:15:48] <hellyeah> it works as expected
[03:16:46] <hellyeah> for example select a date from "from" and see what will happen in "to" https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/31/
[03:17:08] <Mark__> hi hellyeah meet you again.
[03:17:08] <DirtyFinn> why not add the start and end dates to arrays when you select one. you wouldn't need .each() each time...
[03:17:22] <Mark__> i see youâ€™ve been working with your datepickers
[03:17:24] <hellyeah> Mark__: hey
[03:17:37] <hellyeah> Mark__: yes
[03:18:01] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: i am not really good i just try to learn stuff
[03:18:09] <hellyeah> if you have any change pls let me know
[03:18:14] <hellyeah> and show me
[03:18:41] <hellyeah> Mark__: do you know about datepickers
[03:19:02] <Mark__> no.
[03:19:08] <hellyeah> xD
[03:19:09] <DirtyFinn> this isn't code of someone who isn't good :)
[03:19:09] <Mark__> i need to work on my wordpress theme first.
[03:20:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:20:32] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: let say i am in the beginning of road
[03:20:39] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: do you have any fix?
[03:22:25] <DirtyFinn> not yet
[03:22:29] <DirtyFinn> let me think
[03:22:33] <DirtyFinn> ...
[03:22:37] <hellyeah> thank you
[03:22:46] <hellyeah> dont mad at me :)
[03:23:07] <slax0r> do you ever do any bit code without asking a gazillion questions, and annoying others to do the work for you here? seems like past few months, all I see is your name popping up :)
[03:23:17] <DirtyFinn> i'm not :)
[03:23:30] <hellyeah> :XD
[03:23:58] <hellyeah> slax0r: sorry for bothering i am trying :xd
[03:24:23] <slax0r> you're not bothering me, I can't help you anyway, not really a frontend dev :)
[03:24:29] <slax0r> I was just wondering aloud
[03:24:44] <hellyeah> :)
[03:24:54] <hellyeah> i have improvement fortunately
[03:25:17] <hellyeah> slax0r: are you nodejs guy?
[03:25:30] <slax0r> no
[03:25:35] <slax0r> more of a php/python/c++ guy
[03:25:48] <hellyeah> ic
[03:25:56] <slax0r> although, I haven't done c++ for so long, I doubt I can still call myself that
[03:27:55] <gonssal> hellyeah: http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/
[03:28:23] <hellyeah> let me take a look
[03:29:21] <DirtyFinn> hellyeah: I'm getting error "TypeError: $.datepicker[(("_" + options) + "Datepicker")] is undefined" when I click on any of the non-first .from fields
[03:30:23] <DirtyFinn> nevermind :)
[03:30:46] <hellyeah> gonssal: do you think this is the solution for my issue?
[03:32:28] <gonssal> I think it's a better solution than what your are trying to do. Just my opinion.
[03:32:31] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: i will be right back
[03:32:40] <DirtyFinn> ok
[03:32:46] <hellyeah> gonssal: i will take a look
[03:50:22] <hellyeah> hey
[03:50:37] * hellyeah just one last thing then everything is done
[03:50:57] <DirtyFinn> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/33/
[03:51:38] <DirtyFinn> if you didn't create new datepicker every time but instead took the values and inserted them into input fields you created...
[03:51:48] <DirtyFinn> do you see where I'm going with this?
[03:53:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:53:34] <hellyeah> insert them into input fields you create as next input field?
[03:55:25] <DirtyFinn> user clicks 'create' > create two input fields > put datepicker values into the new input fields > disable the new input fields (I didn't do this to the example) > set empty values to datepicker fields
[03:55:46] <DirtyFinn> > rinse and repeat
[03:56:05] <hellyeah> yeah last input field you set empty
[03:56:48] <hellyeah> but it didnt disable date range
[03:57:44] * hellyeah looking
[03:57:59] <DirtyFinn> that's what you get to do :)
[03:58:10] <DirtyFinn> that's what you get to do :)
[03:59:18] <DirtyFinn> I'm not writing your code for you. I merely push you to the right-ish direction so you can experience it yourself :)
[04:00:01] <hellyeah> so
[04:01:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:01:35] <hellyeah> $('.from').last().val('');
[04:01:36] <hellyeah>         $('.to').last().val('');
[04:01:45] <hellyeah> it is empty when you create input boxes
[04:01:51] <hellyeah> why do you make empty?
[04:02:47] <DirtyFinn> just to point out something happened. you don't have to make them empty if you don't want. just remove those lines if you feel so :)
[04:03:10] <DirtyFinn> or set any other value if you like
[04:04:11] <hellyeah> you just clone it if $('.from').length is smaller then 2 right
[04:04:25] <DirtyFinn> yes
[04:04:47] <DirtyFinn> so that it creates the first visible datepicker fields
[04:05:10] <DirtyFinn> now that I think about it, you could just make the existing fields visible instead...
[04:05:35] <hellyeah> you mean input boxes right?
[04:05:41] <DirtyFinn> yep
[04:06:30] <hellyeah> the thing you do is really different from my example https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/31/  i dont understand the difference i am sorry
[04:08:14] <DirtyFinn> the idea is this: instead of creating million datepickers, store the selected values somewhere and have only the one datepicker (or two, depending how you count it).
[04:09:00] <hellyeah> var newfields = "<input class='fromvalue' type='text' value='" + fromvalue + "' /><input class='tovalue' type='text' value='" + tovalue + "' /><br/>";
[04:09:30] <hellyeah> so last datapickers you created is empty
[04:09:40] <hellyeah> you set it in createdatapickers function
[04:10:01] <hellyeah> so you just use before to add defined datapickers
[04:10:15] <hellyeah> thanks to this you dont need to build datapickers again and again
[04:10:18] <DirtyFinn> I don't create a single datepicker, i'm just setting the existing one empty
[04:10:18] <hellyeah> is that true?_
[04:10:27] <DirtyFinn> those are not datepickers
[04:10:37] <DirtyFinn> they are just input boxes
[04:10:44] <hellyeah> well let me try again
[04:10:46] <DirtyFinn> nothing makes them datepickers
[04:10:59] <DirtyFinn> it's all in the code :)
[04:11:00] <hellyeah> instead of creating you are using same inputboxes over and over again
[04:11:07] <DirtyFinn> yes
[04:11:19] <hellyeah> by setting value empty if it small then 2
[04:11:19] <DirtyFinn> well... yes
[04:11:28] <DirtyFinn> ummm...
[04:11:45] <hellyeah> smaller
[04:12:05] <hellyeah> if($('.from').length < 2){ you clone it
[04:12:27] <hellyeah> is that true?
[04:14:21] <hellyeah> the only thing i dont undersand why you used before()
[04:14:39] <DirtyFinn> when you come to the page the first time, there is the one .from field and one .to field. They are hidden, yes? then you clone those fields and then you ahe one visible .from field and one visible .to field. Yes? at that point you have two .from fields and two .to fields. one of each is visible and one invisible. The if($('.from').length < 2) basicallt just checks that one .from field is visible
[04:14:53] <hellyeah> and did you choose that way for performance gain?
[04:15:06] <hellyeah> yes they are hidden
[04:15:38] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: ic what your logic is
[04:15:57] <hellyeah> i just wanna be better this is absolutely better code :)
[04:16:42] <hellyeah> i have to handle some issue i think
[04:17:06] <hellyeah> like disabling input box or avoid creating new input boxes when current one is empty
[04:17:09] <DirtyFinn> in you original example you created the new datepicker below (after) the old ones. so the datepicker "you work with" is the bottom one. the .before() sets the created input fields no top of the datepicker. this way my sample looks the same as yours.
[04:17:19] <hellyeah> how does it help me to disable range of dates
[04:17:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:17:57] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: i understood
[04:17:58] <DirtyFinn> it doesn't. you do that the same way you were doing it before
[04:18:01] <DirtyFinn> or something
[04:18:38] <DirtyFinn> my point all along. Never use more than one datepicker if you don't absolutely have to
[04:18:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:19:02] <hellyeah> datepicker is heavy or what?
[04:19:12] <DirtyFinn> because more you have datepickers the more difficult it will be handling it all. I know from experience
[04:19:40] <DirtyFinn> I would'nt call datepicker heavy. it's just crap :)
[04:19:48] <DirtyFinn> but inevitable cram :)
[04:19:52] <DirtyFinn> *crap
[04:20:09] <DirtyFinn> unavoidable if you wish
[04:20:12] <DirtyFinn> :)
[04:20:19] <hellyeah> why it is crap?
[04:20:38] <hellyeah> but inevitable
[04:20:41] <hellyeah> so face the music
[04:20:46] <hellyeah> you gonna use it
[04:20:46] <hellyeah> :X
[04:20:51] <DirtyFinn> :)
[04:20:52] <DirtyFinn> yep
[04:20:59] <hellyeah> html5  has datepicker i guess
[04:21:09] <hellyeah> firefox and safari didnt implement it yet
[04:21:51] <hellyeah> do you have anything to say about disabling range of dates in next datapickers?
[04:21:57] <DirtyFinn> the thing is (in all languages) if you use a library, the chances are the creators of that library never thought the one situation you have and that is going to cause spaghetti code :)
[04:22:20] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: i understood
[04:22:33] <hellyeah> btw what i meant is disable data of range in another datapickers
[04:22:41] <hellyeah> this design can avoid me to do that
[04:22:46] <DirtyFinn> i got it
[04:22:51] <hellyeah> because each time i am settting this to null
[04:22:53] <BostonGeorge2k> hi, i try to debug javsscript code and i am getting two errors on that single line: http://pastebin.com/9sTvsQ8J
[04:22:56] <BostonGeorge2k> any ideas? :/
[04:23:01] <hellyeah> can it be the ccase?
[04:23:25] <DirtyFinn> i think the datepicker supports disabling date ranges
[04:23:35] <DirtyFinn> shouldn't be too difficult
[04:23:49] <DirtyFinn> (but when I try to do it it wouldn't work :))
[04:23:53] <hellyeah> yes i already disabled the data between.from and .to
[04:24:07] <DirtyFinn> ok. great
[04:24:16] <hellyeah> what i need to do is to disable dates in other datepickers
[04:24:25] <hellyeah> you got what i meantioned
[04:24:33] <hellyeah> for example you choose 21 and 25
[04:24:41] <hellyeah> and create new datepickers
[04:24:56] <hellyeah> i have to see 21,22,23,24,25 disabled
[04:25:08] <DirtyFinn> does this help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30331543/disabling-specific-dates-from-html-datepicker-jquery ?
[04:25:09] <hellyeah> last thing i need to do actually
[04:25:27] <hellyeah> i covered all cases except this
[04:26:02] <hellyeah> i will take a look this question
[04:26:04] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:26:41] <hellyeah> brb
[04:30:24] <DirtyFinn> BostonGeorge2k, could we have a little more code to get the context or what you are trying to achieve with this?
[04:31:23] <BostonGeorge2k> sure, but its not really beauty http://pastebin.com/CQZ44KQd
[04:31:56] <BostonGeorge2k> line 49
[04:34:01] <DirtyFinn> is that supposed to be a string or regex? or something else?
[04:37:13] <imox> morning Iâ€™m trying to use this plugin http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/# but when call the function tocify() then the API adds only the class tocify-hide to my div but not more
[04:38:47] <DirtyFinn> imox, you have the jQueryUI Widget Factory?
[04:38:56] <imox> yes
[04:39:06] <imox> I donâ€™t get any errors
[04:39:08] * Kartagis cleans DirtyFinn
[04:39:17] <DirtyFinn> :D
[04:39:20] <DirtyFinn> that felt good
[04:40:00] <BostonGeorge2k> i honestly hvae no idea
[04:40:10] <imox> at first the widget was missing and I got an error ;) but not the function will called but I got only an empty div ;(
[04:40:52] <DirtyFinn> what else should you get? what does this library do?
[04:41:20] <imox> to create the menu
[04:41:49] <DirtyFinn> like theo ne on the left?
[04:42:04] <DirtyFinn> ah. i see
[04:42:33] <DirtyFinn> can we see your code?
[04:43:04] <imox> yes this on the left
[04:43:51] <imox> http://pastebin.com/3v4UGrAi
[04:43:57] <imox> this is my html
[04:44:07] <imox> and I just call this function $('#toc').tocify()
[04:44:34] <DirtyFinn> this is not html
[04:44:45] <imox> sure jade
[04:45:57] <imox> http://pastebin.com/CCgh0TTc
[04:46:01] <imox> this is my html ;)
[04:47:01] <DirtyFinn> are you supposed to have a list (<ul><li></li></ul>) inside your div? does Tocify require that?
[04:47:55] <DirtyFinn> as i see it, now there's just a div. you expect Tocify to magically fill it with the content you want? :)
[04:49:53] <imox> yes of curse
[04:50:42] <imox> not magically ;) normaly ;) you can read this in the documentation and also can see this in a example from them
[04:52:23] <DirtyFinn> it is magic, I say
[04:52:37] <imox> anyway magic or not ;)
[04:54:33] <DirtyFinn> I mean, i don't see the list elements in your html (or jade). I'm just wondering if you don't have it there
[04:54:55] <imox> this makes the API for me
[04:55:03] <imox> read the doc ;)
[04:58:31] <DirtyFinn> humor me. put this inside the div and try <ul><li>q</li></ul><ul><li>q</li><ul><li>w</li></ul><ul><li>w</li></ul></ul><ul><li>q</li></ul><ul><li>q</li></ul>
[04:59:33] <imox> DirtyFinn: noooooo
[04:59:39] <imox> this makes this API for me
[04:59:43] <imox> read the doc
[05:00:02] <DirtyFinn> where does the api get the api get the menu items?
[05:00:09] <DirtyFinn> I'm not reading the doc :)
[05:00:16] <imox> form the h2, h3, h4 ......
[05:01:09] <imox> DirtyFinn: http://pastebin.com/DCwqWcdL
[05:01:22] <imox> you can see here this works an could u find an ul ?
[05:07:35] <DirtyFinn> have you tried to remove the id's from your h2s and h3s (as if that would help :))
[05:10:08] <imox> no no tired ^^
[05:11:41] <imox> same problem
[05:12:37] <DirtyFinn> could you show your code? like all of it not just html?
[05:13:04] <DirtyFinn> well. not "all of it" if there's a lot of it but i guess you get the point
[05:13:39] <imox> yeahh but not really possible because I use a big framework with requirejs backbonejs â€¦..
[05:14:26] <DirtyFinn> maybe some of the libraries conflict with this one?
[05:14:31] <imox> no
[05:14:45] <imox> the API also do sth. ;)
[05:14:58] <DirtyFinn> can't tell what's wrong there without seeing code
[05:15:00] <imox> the api adds the calls tocify-hide to my div
[05:15:03] <imox> but not more
[05:15:16] <DirtyFinn> it is possible i couldn't do anything with the code either :)
[05:15:34] <imox> yes ;(
[05:16:32] <imox> but the doc from this API is really incomplete
[05:16:44] <DirtyFinn> they usually are
[05:17:08] <imox> unfortunately a lot of JS docs ;(
[05:17:39] <imox> I donâ€™t like really Java but the java docs mostly very good
[05:31:04] <BostonGeorge2k> could someone recommend a js minifier that does not break my js ? :/
[05:35:09] <DirtyFinn> http://jscompress.com/
[05:35:31] <DirtyFinn> but if it breaks your code, maybe the problem is with the code.
[05:35:59] <DirtyFinn> use the magic word "var" and a mystical semicolon (;) to vaoid problems
[05:42:08] <Nanor> I'm using autocomplete on a modal form, when I type in the data it doesn't appear, but when I press the down arrow it cycles through matches
[05:42:20] <Nanor> I think the dropdown is appearing behind the modal - how can I fix this?
[05:43:15] <DirtyFinn> can you set z-index for the options container?
[05:43:38] <Nanor> hrm, good shout. I'll look into that
[05:46:34] <Mark__> hey whatâ€™s the jquery function that can replace a href when click on a button?
[05:47:13] <Nanor> a bit off topic but does anyone know if you can get click into a class through the developer tools - similar to control + clicking in an IDE?
[05:48:30] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, $('#element-id').attr('href') = 'http://www.whatever.com';
[05:49:03] <Mark__> thanks.
[05:49:08] <DirtyFinn> np
[05:50:28] <Mark__> do i have to use it with the onclick events or is it standalone?
[05:50:45] <DirtyFinn> use it with the onclick
[05:51:04] <DirtyFinn> *inside the onclick function
[05:54:02] <Mark__> for some reason this doesnâ€™t work, what did i miss? https://jsfiddle.net/869fj1ty/
[05:54:03] <CMFDesign> Hey guys. I'm new to jQuery (really new) and yesterday I used it to make text change inside a div upon hover.
[05:54:23] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, let's see
[05:54:39] <CMFDesign> http://178.159.11.199/promotional-goodies/index.html - this is the site. However, how would I make the text colour and background also change on hover?
[05:56:53] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, $("#link").attr("href", "http://www.yahoo.com");
[05:57:01] <DirtyFinn> tha't how it's done :)
[05:57:06] <DirtyFinn> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dGZJLW
[05:57:07] <Mark__> oh is it just the link?
[05:57:18] <CMFDesign> I am referring to the header area btw.
[05:58:29] <Mark__> hey DirtyFinn , the fiddle doesnâ€™t seem to work either..?
[05:58:39] <Mark__> i click on the button, and nothing happens.
[05:58:49] <DirtyFinn> yes.
[05:59:18] <DirtyFinn> try this $('.main_top_center_top_title').attr('href', 'http://www.ike.co.kr/NEW/ikebooks/books_introduce.asp');
[06:00:24] <Mark__> sorry, but nothing happens..
[06:00:39] <DirtyFinn> so the point is to set the href attribute with the .attr() method. .attr([selector], [value])
[06:00:50] <Mark__> sec.
[06:01:05] <DirtyFinn> do you have several elements with the class main_top_center_top_title?
[06:02:53] <Mark__> i donâ€™t think so.
[06:02:56] <Mark__> sec
[06:02:58] <DirtyFinn> ok
[06:03:08] <CMFDesign> DirtyFinn: Can you take a look at my issue when you get a sec?
[06:03:16] <Mark__>  $('.main_top_center').attr('href', 'http://www.ike.co.kr/NEW/ikebooks/books_introduce.asp'); this doesnâ€™t work.
[06:03:20] <Mark__> and here ismy website
[06:03:22] <DirtyFinn> sure
[06:03:28] <Mark__> http://www.ike.co.kr/English/main.html
[06:03:37] <CMFDesign> Its the last thing holding off a project from being complete and I am stuck totally haha
[06:04:38] <Mark__> and i have another question for you DirtyFinn  if you donâ€™t mind.
[06:04:38] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, you are trying to change the href attribute of a div?
[06:04:43] <Mark__> hmm?
[06:05:14] <Mark__> im simply trying to connect to the address above when click on a specific button
[06:05:22] <Mark__> which in this case itâ€™s .main_top_center
[06:05:38] <DirtyFinn> what you mean by 'connect'?
[06:06:04] <Mark__> enter the specific page when click on the button.
[06:06:15] <Mark__> im not sure if im explaining in the right sense.
[06:06:32] <Mark__> but you get the point.
[06:06:39] <DirtyFinn> so you click a button and want to go to another page?
[06:06:54] <Mark__> yeah the first question i aksed whas how i can replace href using jquery.
[06:06:57] <Mark__> *asked
[06:07:17] <DirtyFinn> because divs (.main_top_center is a div) don't have href attribute. only anchors (<a>) have
[06:07:38] <DirtyFinn> href is not same than redirect :)
[06:07:42] <CMFDesign> http://178.159.11.199/promotional-goodies/index.html - The top header I created the text hover with jQuery, but I want to make it so that on hover the background and text colour changes. Any takers?
[06:07:45] <Mark__> oh. right. i thought what you gave me was linking a specific div to a link page
[06:08:12] <Mark__> how should  i go about?
[06:09:11] <DirtyFinn> if you want to redirect the user to another page use window.location.href = "http://www.something.com" inside the onclick function
[06:10:14] <Mark__> could you be kind to write the simple code for me?
[06:10:38] <DirtyFinn> CMFDesign, you can use css on this (or jquery if you want) [to be continued...]
[06:10:56] <Mark__> and i have a second question, if anyone can help me out,
[06:11:00] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, I don't know what you want. you're not amking any sense
[06:11:10] <DirtyFinn> *making
[06:11:14] <Mark__> DirtyFinn: ...
[06:11:36] <Mark__> i think *what i want * is quite obvious through numeruos times of explanation
[06:11:42] <CMFDesign> DirtyFinn: Ok, I'm listening...
[06:11:46] <Mark__> that i want to move on to the specific page when i click on the button,
[06:11:47] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, you click a button. then what is supposed to happen?
[06:11:49] <Mark__> but thanks for your help.
[06:11:52] <DirtyFinn> ok
[06:12:14] <Mark__> but the thing is that the code you gave me and the even the fiddle you made yourself
[06:12:18] <Mark__> was not functioning.
[06:12:24] <Mark__> but i appreciate your help though.
[06:12:44] <DirtyFinn> because it was not for the problem i thought you had
[06:13:50] <CMFDesign> DirtyFinn: So, which is easier the CSS route or the jQuery route?
[06:14:06] <DirtyFinn> Mark__, put this inside the onclick function:   window.location.href = "http://www.something.com";
[06:14:14] <DirtyFinn> just replace the url
[06:14:16] <Mark__> okay. thanks
[06:14:27] <DirtyFinn> CMFDesign, let's see
[06:15:27] <CMFDesign> DirtyFinn: It would be cool if the text changed as soon as you hovered in the box, rather than over the text itself but I couldn't figure that out either. Ideally when hovering in the box, the text will change, as will the text colour and background colour of the div.
[06:15:56] <DirtyFinn> CMFDesign, in css .pass:hover{ color: '#f20000'} changes the text color on hover
[06:18:32] <CMFDesign> ok cool
[06:18:34] <DirtyFinn> CMFDesign, oops, it's .pass:hover{ color: #f20000}
[06:18:46] <DirtyFinn> without quotes :)
[06:18:50] <CMFDesign> Yeah I noticed lol
[06:19:35] <CMFDesign> Nope, still doesn't work :P lol
[06:21:10] <DirtyFinn> CMFDesign, here's a sample on how to handle in jquery http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NxwyxJ
[06:21:37] <CMFDesign> ok but how about the background?
[06:21:44] <CMFDesign> I want the text and background to change together?
[06:22:44] <DirtyFinn> if you reload thet page (codepen) i just linked to you, I made a change
[06:22:47] <DirtyFinn> i added background: #00f200;
[06:22:50] <DirtyFinn> to the css
[06:23:44] <DirtyFinn> so basically you just give the element a class when hovering and the css linked to the class makes the job
[06:25:09] <CMFDesign> DirtyFinn: I started learning jquery yesterday,so I've not a clue how I'd apply that to my scenario.
[06:26:13] <CMFDesign> So I've got the text to change, just not the background lol
[06:26:20] <DirtyFinn> you have this page already... is it some sample by someone else?
[06:27:10] <DirtyFinn> i have to go to eat at this point
[06:27:18] <DirtyFinn> but i'll be back
[06:28:25] <cannap> why jquery for hover? :D
[06:34:39] <CMFDesign> cannap: This is how I was told it should be done
[06:34:59] <CMFDesign> So I had to go and learn how to do it for text hover, then I now cannot work out how to make the background of the box change on hover lol
[06:35:05] <cannap> k but when he will only change color with this dont do it :D
[06:35:25] <CMFDesign> The text changes also.
[06:35:40] <CMFDesign> Ok, so you tell me how do I change the background color of that box on hover?
[06:36:17] <Nanor> Can someone explain how I can get this autocomplete list to appear above the modal? http://i.imgur.com/6H82iaI.png
[06:36:36] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/otu4eotp/ @CMFDesign it would go with pure css
[06:36:42] <cannap> but im not sure what you want to do later
[06:37:13] <CMFDesign> Ok, but in my example how would you achieve this?
[06:37:19] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/otu4eotp/2/
[06:37:29] <CMFDesign> Bear in mind the text in the box also changes? Can you look at my site and help me apply it to that?
[06:37:54] <cannap> which site?
[06:38:02] <cannap> you mean the codepen link?
[06:38:12] <CMFDesign> So can you help me apply this to my site now please cannap? http://178.159.11.199/promotional-goodies/index.html
[06:38:13] <cannap> sry i joined a bit later
[06:38:22] <cannap> i only saw the codepen link
[06:38:29] <cannap> where?
[06:38:37] <CMFDesign> cannap: Its cool, so its that top box. When hovered into I wanted the text to change and then colours to change.
[06:38:50] <cannap> on which class is the hover
[06:38:52] <CMFDesign> Currently the hover text is the same colour as the bg text, so it isn't working lol, 2 secs
[06:39:17] <CMFDesign> refresh now and hover on top box
[06:39:50] <CMFDesign> So you can see the text changes on hover...but I want the background of the box to change also
[06:39:55] <cannap> the yellow?
[06:40:12] <CMFDesign> Yes, the background of the header box.
[06:40:30] <CMFDesign> so when you hover, the text changes, the text colour changes and the box background changes :)
[06:40:38] <cannap> yea
[06:40:39] <cannap> this wont work
[06:40:43] <cannap> because you have inline style
[06:40:52] <cannap> you cant override inline styles when you use a css file
[06:40:53] <cannap> for this
[06:41:11] <CMFDesign> So i need to set the background box colour in CSS rather than inline?
[06:41:14] <cannap> yes
[06:41:17] <CMFDesign> Then use :hover to change on hover?
[06:41:20] <cannap> yes
[06:41:28] <CMFDesign> Cool, you see how the text changes on hover currently...
[06:41:40] <cannap> then you can do as exmaple .box:hover .someInnerClass { changec color }
[06:41:43] <CMFDesign> is there any way to make that happen when you hover inside the div, rather than just the text?
[06:42:13] <cannap> we should talk in #web because has nothing todo with jquery^^
[06:43:00] <CMFDesign> ok, are you there?
[06:48:31] <Nanor> Can someone explain how I can get this autocomplete list to appear above the modal? It just stays behind and never shows http://i.imgur.com/6H82iaI.png
[07:00:14] <hellyeah> when you select a dates via datepickers then create element and pick other dates. But i want to disable range of date then you select in pervious elemen  t. Any help or suggestion i tried to write smt smt like that in line23. pls help me to figure it out thnaks https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/31/
[07:02:52] <sl33k> hi guys. i am struggling to write a selector for a tag <script data-main="anything">.
[07:04:25] <slax0r> sl33k: script[data-main='anything'] ?
[07:04:49] <sl33k> slax0r: i dont want to hard-code the anything part.
[07:05:04] <sl33k> would a wildcard like * do?
[07:08:17] <slax0r> but, why would you want that then?
[07:08:27] <Limarson> sl33k: $('[data-ng-if]') is selecting all elements with data-ng-if on my site, so most likely $('script[data-main]') should work
[07:08:40] <slax0r> script[data-main] will do btw
[07:08:46] <slax0r> but I fail to see the point in this
[07:10:28] * DirtyFinn is back
[07:10:40] <slax0r> and still dirty
[07:10:46] <DirtyFinn> yup
[07:10:55] <slax0r> but you are a viking, so you are allowed to be dirty
[07:11:03] <DirtyFinn> yup
[07:19:41] <hellyeah> no one around?
[07:21:38] <DirtyFinn> i'm here
[07:22:33] <DirtyFinn> that's not much, though
[07:23:30] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: but you dont know how to solve my problem tho :XD
[07:23:51] <DirtyFinn> which problem was that again?
[07:24:41] <hellyeah> disable range of date
[07:24:48] <hellyeah> do you understand that problem?
[07:24:50] <DirtyFinn> ah. that one
[07:24:56] <hellyeah> i can meantion again
[07:24:58] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:25:25] <DirtyFinn> i understand what you're trying to achieve, but i don't have the solution
[07:25:44] <hellyeah> no problem
[07:25:51] <hellyeah> this is last step i need to do
[07:25:58] <hellyeah> i am designing frontend for a project
[07:26:10] <hellyeah> when i do this step it will be done
[07:29:48] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys, I wrote a small site which has a jquery datepicker, I set the language to danish which I got from a script fil e"$.datepicker.setDefaults($.datepicker.regional["da"]);"   .. now I launched my site on an IIS on an English server, and now the datepicker treats the inputs as English, even though I changed the date/time settings on the server to danish, and got the regional script file...   I got 19/1/2016 when I pick a date
[07:29:51] <P3nnyw1se> I don't know where to make changes
[07:30:43] <P3nnyw1se> Its danish on the danish machine.. and English on the ENglish server.. even though I got the regional settings
[07:53:47] <jmdrawneek> Does anyone know how to stop a checkbox from being checked when there's no click event?
[07:57:35] <DirtyFinn> you mean that the box is (maybe) checked and after some time it unchecks itself?
[07:57:51] <DirtyFinn> $( "#x" ).prop( "checked", false );
[07:58:07] <DirtyFinn> that would uncheck it but not autonomously
[07:58:52] <jmdrawneek> Basically I'm trying to delay a checkbox being submitted
[07:59:51] <DirtyFinn> oh
[07:59:59] <DirtyFinn> sounds... funky
[08:00:09] <jmdrawneek> I've got an annoying project where they want fake ajax. So I need to stop the checkbox from being picked in as changing do a silly animation then carry on
[08:00:18] <jmdrawneek> Yea I know :o/
[08:00:54] <jmdrawneek> Ah thinking about it maybe I could just interrupt the label click trigger
[08:01:12] <sl33k> slax0r: hey. do you mind if i share a grunt plugin script?
[08:02:35] <slax0r> sl33k: why me?
[08:04:00] <jmdrawneek> Is there an opposite of e.preventDefault();?
[08:04:14] <hellyeah> hey
[08:04:36] <hellyeah> why do you need opposite?
[08:05:01] <DirtyFinn> $('form').submit() ?
[08:05:19] <jmdrawneek> So I could preventDeault, do some stuff then then retrigger it
[08:05:37] <DirtyFinn> check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5651933/what-is-the-opposite-of-evt-preventdefault
[08:05:51] <DirtyFinn> the first answer
[08:06:38] <jmdrawneek> Ah perfect
[08:06:48] <jmdrawneek> Thanks

[12:52:08] <deadevilboy> hi guys
[12:52:13] <deadevilboy> enlight me
[12:52:24] <deadevilboy> I am adding html code dinamically
[12:52:59] <deadevilboy> and one of the selects should trigger a hidden div when an option is selected
[12:53:09] <deadevilboy> I am delegating the on change
[12:53:14] <deadevilboy> but it is not working
[12:53:17] <duch_kazatel> show us :)
[12:55:25] <deadevilboy> duch_kazatel: wait cause it is a lot of code
[12:55:29] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:55:31] <duch_kazatel> i don't want all of it.
[12:55:33] <duch_kazatel> just an example.
[12:55:41] <deadevilboy> and I'm trying to put in on fiddle
[12:55:52] <duch_kazatel> back up - for your delegated listener, are you binding to something that exists on pageload?
[12:56:00] <deadevilboy> yes
[12:56:05] <deadevilboy> I always use document
[12:56:26] <deadevilboy> because that code is being allocated on a pageload
[12:56:39] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid document, but okay.
[12:57:56] <deadevilboy> why duck?
[12:57:58] <deadevilboy> duch
[12:57:59] <deadevilboy> sorry
[12:58:24] <deadevilboy> just for learning purposes of course
[12:58:30] <duch_kazatel> you're making it filter every time that event fires.  i'd bind to a more contextually relevant place.
[12:58:55] <duch_kazatel> something could be capturing the event and preventing it from bubbling.
[13:03:05] <deadevilboy> duch_kazatel: I see the point then
[13:13:15] <deadevilboy> duch_kazatel: it's working
[13:13:19] <deadevilboy> sorry to bother u
[13:13:47] <deadevilboy> I had the }); for the function() and then I forget to close on the event handler
[13:13:48] <deadevilboy> lol
[13:13:55] <deadevilboy> I need an IDE
[13:13:57] <deadevilboy> hahahaha
[13:16:55] <duch_kazatel> first stop is always the console to check for errors ;)
[13:24:04] <cipher__> Is it possible to retrieve the GET parameters with jquery?

[14:30:15] <shoky> hellyeah-home: for a bit
[14:32:10] <hellyeah-home> actually i understand the logic you get all dates with prevall() and beforeshown day just disable the day before those days and beforeshownday must return an array but i couldnt do the solution can you help me little bit about that https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/30/
[14:32:38] <shoky> :\
[14:33:11] <hellyeah-home> am i wrong?
[14:34:21] <shoky> you need to loop over the previous rows.  .datepicker("getDate")  only gets one date. but you're doing "getdate" instead of "getDate" and you're running it on the wrong elements
[14:34:50] <duch_kazatel> hrmmm.
[14:36:59] <hellyeah-home> hmm
[14:37:04] <hellyeah-home> just a sec
[14:38:41] <hellyeah-home> shoky: still wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/43/
[14:39:16] <hellyeah-home> lemme try smt
[14:39:26] <shoky> hellyeah-home: you're running .datepicker("getDate")  on the row <div>s , not on the datepickerrs.. and you're not looping over them
[14:39:46] <shoky> and you're not checking if its in the range.. you didnt' really do anything.
[14:39:53] <hellyeah-home> i understand smt let me try
[14:40:02] <shoky> i'll just do it for you :\
[14:40:09] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[14:40:16] <duch_kazatel> that seems to be the problem.
[14:40:27] <duch_kazatel> they're not doing their own work - people just keep doing it for them.
[14:40:40] <shoky> i wait a couple days before doing a step for them...
[14:40:49] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[14:40:56] <shoky> trying to get them to progress on their own in the meantime.. not working so far :(
[14:41:20] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a fundamental misunderstanding about something then.
[14:41:26] <shoky> code :)
[14:41:31] <duch_kazatel> eeexactly ;)
[14:42:03] <shoky> hellyeah-home i'll do this step for you but promise to analyze it for a year until you understand it 100%  thx
[14:42:41] <hellyeah-home> yes
[14:42:44] <hellyeah-home> i promise
[14:43:04] <hellyeah-home> once upon a time i didnt know anything
[14:43:10] <hellyeah-home> thank you
[14:43:14] <hellyeah-home> i will be better
[14:46:30] <shoky> oh i see you now disable the previous rows
[14:46:49] <shoky> anyway i'm doing a gross job with duplication, but it works, you're welcome to clean it up :)
[14:46:58] <shoky> it's also not performant
[14:47:06] <shoky> checking previous rows for each date
[14:47:14] <shoky> but whatevs
[14:47:33] <shoky> hellyeah-home: https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/44/
[14:48:55] <hellyeah-home> shoky: thanks
[14:49:09] <hellyeah-home> i will look at it if you have time later
[14:49:13] <hellyeah-home> can we discuss it?
[14:49:25] <shoky> sure
[14:49:31] <hellyeah-home> thank you
[14:50:32] <XHFHX> Hi there. How can I update the DOM after I appended something with JQ? I know there is .on(..) but this doesnt help me for this particular problem I want to solve: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8275978/3475778
[14:50:46] <XHFHX> I always get 0 as index
[14:51:41] <hellyeah-home> i dont know jq
[14:51:48] <hellyeah-home> but you append element to the body
[14:51:49] <XHFHX> jquery
[14:51:49] <hellyeah-home> ?
[14:51:53] <XHFHX> hes
[14:51:56] <XHFHX> *yes
[14:51:57] <hellyeah-home> ah i am sorry
[14:52:10] <hellyeah-home> not good about abbreveation
[14:52:15] <hellyeah-home> do you have fiddle?
[14:52:49] <XHFHX> wouldn't help pretty much because it's a python project :/
[14:52:56] <XHFHX> with templates and so on
[14:53:06] <XHFHX> i'll see if I can do a minimal example
[14:54:18] <paulvd> hello, $("a").trigger("click"); works fine on existing elements, what if i want to trigger a click on ajax element
[14:56:12] <hellyeah-home> XHFHX: if you can do people here can help you better
[14:56:35] <XHFHX> yeah, I'm working on making the minimal example working :D
[14:57:41] <XHFHX> https://jsfiddle.net/85cssw3x/
[14:57:54] <XHFHX> hellyeah-home: jquery is missing on the import
[14:57:58] <XHFHX> otherwise it should work
[14:58:32] <hellyeah-home> you should include jquery 2.1.3
[14:58:51] <XHFHX> well, ok, but  it won't solve the problem ;)
[14:59:14] <XHFHX> why isn't there a simple function on JQuery that updates the DOM to it's current state? Would be much easier this way ;)
[15:00:40] <hellyeah-home> i well i am not expert
[15:01:00] <hellyeah-home> where is .video-content on html markup
[15:01:13] <hellyeah-home> or you created dynamically
[15:01:33] <paulvd> ?
[15:01:53] <XHFHX> thats a div where add-video-div is inside, sorry, forgot that to include
[15:02:12] <hellyeah-home> paulvd: i didnt say smt to toyu
[15:02:53] <hellyeah-home> hmm problem you always see 1. video right
[15:02:59] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: the DOM gets updated immediately after appending something to it
[15:03:02] <hellyeah-home> you want 1.video 2.video 3.video..
[15:03:25] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: of course, the "view source" of a browser doesnt change, but look at your DOM in webdev tools
[15:03:45] <XHFHX> NoiseEee: Yeah, but not the jQuery DOM changes
[15:03:51] <NoiseEee> no
[15:03:56] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: im not sure what your issue is
[15:04:00] <NoiseEee> but what is a "jquery DOM"
[15:04:07] <XHFHX> well, the DOM that jquery uses
[15:04:39] <XHFHX> because every .close I click I get a 0 as response
[15:05:54] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: your issue is that you are watching for ".close" clicks before any exist in the DOM
[15:06:02] <hellyeah-home> you may initialize value each time you click
[15:07:29] <NoiseEee> arrays are 0-based right?
[15:07:48] <XHFHX> NoiseEee: Well, yeah, but how do I fix this?
[15:07:50] <hellyeah-home> yes?
[15:07:59] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: fix what?
[15:08:02] <XHFHX> y
[15:08:16] <XHFHX> that jQuery counts/see's the other .close
[15:08:26] <XHFHX> for some reason the count mechanism doesn't work anymore
[15:08:38] <XHFHX> from here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8275978/3475778
[15:09:23] <duch_kazatel> XHFHX i think you're confused
[15:09:27] <NoiseEee> i'll say
[15:09:28] <duch_kazatel> you probably need delegation.
[15:09:45] <NoiseEee> and you should probably explain what you are trying to do without pointing to stack overflow issues
[15:09:49] <duch_kazatel> jquery sees the current "active" document - you're probably binding to things before they exist.
[15:09:50] <paulvd> hello, $("a").trigger("click"); works fine on existing elements, what if i want to trigger a click on external js html
[15:10:04] <duch_kazatel> paulvd that sentence doesn't make sense.
[15:10:09] <NoiseEee> you're trying to figure out which "x" was clicked / which "video" to remove XHFHX?
[15:10:12] <duch_kazatel> that will trigger click all 'a' tags.
[15:10:21] <XHFHX> NoiseEee: Exactly
[15:10:30] <duch_kazatel> XHFHX do you have a jsfiddle?
[15:11:05] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: you do know that you're explicitly passing a count of "1" every time in that code, right?
[15:11:33] <XHFHX> duch_kazatel: yeah, but it's a lot of work to include everything as I work in flask. Heres a non-working fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/85cssw3x/
[15:11:44] <duch_kazatel> slow way down duder.
[15:11:49] <duch_kazatel> getting ahead of yourself.
[15:11:57] <XHFHX> NoiseEee: yeah, that has something to do which isn't shown in the excerpt of the code
[15:12:05] <duch_kazatel> do you have a more complete example of your html?
[15:12:45] <XHFHX> duch_kazatel: acutally there's only one div missing, i'll update it
[15:13:25] <XHFHX> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/85cssw3x/3/
[15:13:38] <paulvd> hello, $("a").trigger("click"); works fine on existing elements, what if i want to trigger a click on external js html
[15:15:13] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: also https://jsfiddle.net/85cssw3x/5/ should get you going
[15:17:20] <paulvd> i think nobody knows lol
[15:17:21] <XHFHX> NoiseEee: Thanks, I have also thought of this but I don't think it's an optimal solution because it adds some not really necessary code if jQuery would only update it's DOM :/
[15:17:29] <XHFHX> *adds
[15:17:40] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: you are fundamentally misunderstanding what is happening
[15:17:46] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: which isn't going to lead to a 'solution'
[15:17:58] <NoiseEee> there is no issue with 'jQuery would only update its DOM'
[15:18:01] <NoiseEee> zero.
[15:18:16] <XHFHX> mh, ok
[15:19:01] <XHFHX> well, whats the problem then? Why do I always get a 0-count on elements added with jQuery afterwards, but a proper count on "manually" inserted elements?
[15:19:02] <badcss> Can someone help me with sticky.js on my website?
[15:19:39] <badcss> for some reason it's becoming sticky way before the element is close to leaving the viewport
[15:19:43] <badcss> i think it has to do with floats
[15:22:58] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: what do you think $(this).index does in your code?
[15:23:40] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: because i'm guessing you think its doing something that its not :)
[15:24:46] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/85cssw3x/6/ look!  now its all returning "1" because of the <span> I put in front of the button
[15:25:07] <NoiseEee> XHFHX: so... you don't want .index, there is no 'jquery not updating the DOM' issue or anything like that.  good luck!
[15:25:29] <NoiseEee> https://api.jquery.com/index/ (for reference)
[15:27:48] <XHFHX> mh, ok. Thanks NoiseEee!
[15:28:13] <XHFHX> ahhh
[15:28:14] <NoiseEee> no prob XHFHX
[15:28:21] <XHFHX> yeah. I get it^^
[15:39:46] <badcss> Can someone help me?
[15:39:52] <duch_kazatel> what's your question?
[15:42:34] <badcss> https://jsfiddle.net/1oo73yd7/
[15:42:40] <badcss> Sorry I was trying to put it in a jsfiddle
[15:42:59] <badcss> I am trying to make it so when you click the button .view-gallery
[15:43:14] <badcss> it simulates a click on the closest picture which will trigger a lightbox
[15:43:39] <badcss> i only copied over one image of the gallery but there are multiple galleries on the page
[15:43:44] <duch_kazatel> so .closest() is for ancestors.
[15:43:45] <badcss> with only 1 picture showing on each gallery
[15:44:09] <badcss> oooh- would it be .find() then?
[15:44:09] <duch_kazatel> kind of like .parent()
[15:44:24] <badcss> I was trying to climb the DOM tree
[15:44:44] <duch_kazatel> i'd give these more contextual classes.
[15:45:14] <badcss> It's all being done within a page builder of a client's WP site
[15:45:16] <duch_kazatel> but yea, .closest() goes "up", starting at the current element and stops when it finds something that matches your selector. .find() goes "down" and gets everything that matches your selector.
[15:45:30] <arc_> are you not able to add another class to an element?
[15:45:40] <duch_kazatel> also, you probably don't want to use .trigger() - explicitly call the method to show the lightbox.
[15:46:48] <badcss> 1 sec, making the page viewable
[15:47:00] <duch_kazatel> err...
[15:47:02] <duch_kazatel> no thanks :)
[15:47:02] <badcss> http://clubautosport.net/event-center/venue-spaces-2/ - pass: development
[15:47:54] <badcss> so if .closest goes up the dom tree
[15:48:04] <badcss> i could have it find .et_pb_module
[15:48:13] <badcss> and then I could use .find to get the first link
[15:48:18] <badcss> right?
[15:48:19] <duch_kazatel> i wouldnm'
[15:48:22] <duch_kazatel> *wouldn't do it that way.
[15:48:27] <badcss> oh
[15:48:30] <duch_kazatel> modify the templates and give classes to things instead.
[15:48:43] <badcss> i cant, there is no page template behind it
[15:48:47] <badcss> it uses a page builder interface
[15:48:50] <badcss> it's really old
[15:48:53] <badcss> from like 2012
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> you're going to want to put some structure around this, otherwise, you're going to be getting constant support calls :)
[15:49:25] <duch_kazatel> but you're understanding the basic idea.
[15:49:40] <duch_kazatel> also - you want to try to call the lightbox show method directly instead of triggering a click.
[15:49:48] <badcss> ok
[15:49:59] <badcss> what are the drawbacks to using a trigger click?
[15:50:29] <duch_kazatel> you're proxying logic through the DOM, which is confusing and not what it's made for.
[15:50:48] <duch_kazatel> you might also trigger other things that you don't really want to trigger - you care about opening the lightbox.  make sense?
[15:50:56] <badcss> gotcha
[15:51:41] <hellyeah-home> proxying logic
[15:51:49] <hellyeah-home> i really dont understand what does it mean
[15:53:02] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah-home so what he wants to do is launch a lightbox, right?
[15:53:38] <hellyeah-home> i guess i couldnt follow i clean up my house
[15:53:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:53:49] <hellyeah-home> but proxying lgic seems interesting usage
[15:54:50] <arc_> instead of directly calling the function, he's basing it on the relationship between the element that was clicked on and something else in the dom. it's a very tenuous way of doing it
[15:55:04] <duch_kazatel> ^
[15:55:33] <arc_> especially if you didn't write the dom yourself ...
[15:55:43] <hellyeah-home> i am confused it is supposed  to use click directly on element?
[15:55:51] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:56:00] <duch_kazatel> you avoid calling logic that way entirely.
[15:56:04] <duch_kazatel> call the function you want directly.
[16:27:43] <persina> I am using jquery 2.1.4 and IE is complaining: Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener', any ideas?
[16:27:52] <duch_kazatel> what version of IE?
[16:28:31] <persina> IE 11
[16:28:37] <arc_> what object
[16:30:00] <persina> arc_: What do you mean?
[16:30:15] <duch_kazatel> persina they're looking for specifics
[16:30:30] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing that error by virtue of including jquery 2.1.4 on a page.
[16:30:59] <persina> duch_kazatel: It's being thrown by this jquery line: a.addEventListener("load",I,!1))),H.promise(b)}
[16:31:07] <duch_kazatel> that's not jquery.
[16:31:19] <persina> duch_kazatel: Its jquery-2.1.4.min.js
[16:31:19] <duch_kazatel> you mean it's happening within the library?>
[16:31:24] <duch_kazatel> show your code.
[16:31:27] <persina> duch_kazatel: Yes
[16:31:30] <duch_kazatel> sounbds like you might be using something incorrectly.
[16:31:47] <persina> duch_kazatel: It works fine in every other browser... sec lemee bpaste
[16:32:48] <persina> duch_kazatel: https://bpaste.net/show/afdee1cde1db
[16:33:36] <duch_kazatel> open the stack trace in IE - what does that look like?
[16:34:11] <arc_> don't you need $(document) not $('document')
[16:34:19] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:34:36] <duch_kazatel> (was trying to help them learn to use the debugger, but yeah that's probably doing it)
[16:34:41] <arc_> oh heh
[16:34:47] <duch_kazatel> it's all good.
[16:36:54] <persina> duch_kazatel arc_: Still getting the error after I made that change...hmm
[16:37:06] <duch_kazatel> can you make a fiddle?
[16:37:38] <persina> duch_kazatel: I think there is an issue with the actual jquery library
[16:37:45] <duch_kazatel> persina i really doubt that :)
[16:38:04] <arc_> also, is there any code that appears before what is in that paste
[16:38:12] <arc_> may be some syntax error prior to that
[16:38:16] <duch_kazatel> you're alleging that there's a very basic bug with a library used by something like 75% of the top million sites on the web.
[16:38:36] <duch_kazatel> :0) can you show us the actual error in a fiddle or somethinbg?
[16:40:19] <persina> duch_kazatel: K, just need to remove the other js libraries that I'm linking too
[16:40:47] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:40:54] <duch_kazatel> so you can replicate the bug without those?
[16:41:34] <persina> duch_kazatel: I have it showing the error with just jquery being linked.  Ill make the fiddle now
[16:52:12] <persina> duch_kazatel: http://imagebin.ca/v/2U2SJsK1Xzay
[16:52:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah, don't care about that.
[16:52:25] <duch_kazatel> i need YOUR code :)
[16:52:31] <duch_kazatel> i have a feeling something is making a bad call.
[16:52:43] <lyhr> is there a method i can use to replace a parameter in another javscript function on a page? i want to replace the /page/... in window.open("/page/timeoutwarn.jsp"
[16:52:53] <duch_kazatel> lyhr nope.
[16:53:08] <lyhr> damnit!
[16:53:28] <duch_kazatel> you coudl try to redeclare the function, but i have a feeling that's... not really what you want to do.
[16:53:39] <duch_kazatel> and i'm not even sure you can actually do that with that method.
[16:54:25] <lyhr> interesting so it is included in a function declaration of course if i redeclared the entire function would that possibly work
[16:54:30] <persina> duch_kazatel: The fiddle doesn't show the error idk why arg
[16:54:47] <duch_kazatel> persina screenshot the console.
[16:55:03] <duch_kazatel> lyhr that's not going to work in this case i don't think.
[16:55:24] <lyhr> ok will brainstorm on other ideas
[16:55:31] <duch_kazatel> just fix the code making the call.
[16:56:06] <persina> duch_kazatel: http://imagebin.ca/v/2U2TWBPZU1y6
[16:56:26] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[16:56:39] <duch_kazatel> you're in IE7 mode.
[16:56:41] <duch_kazatel> that's why it's broken.
[16:57:14] <duch_kazatel> absolutely not an issue with jquery :)
[16:57:36] <persina> duch_kazatel: What do you mean? When I go to about it says IE11
[16:57:45] <duch_kazatel> look at the first line of your console.
[16:57:58] <duch_kazatel> "The attached page targets document mode 7."
[16:58:45] <persina> duch_kazatel: Does that mean its IE7 and not 11?
[16:58:58] <duch_kazatel> that means IE is running as if it were 7 and not 11.
[16:59:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a compatibility thing.
[16:59:19] <duch_kazatel> this on an intranet site?
[16:59:37] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:17:41] <bonks> Is there a more efficient way, using jquery, to check if at least one item matches a condition rather than using $.grep, which enumerates all items?
[17:40:10] * taplar hates ice
[18:25:58] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to get either a dom element or a jquery object wrapping that element. But instead I get a string: http://pastebin.com/MVWW1THZ
[18:26:10] <bobdobbs> The string I get back is "[Object object]"
[18:26:22] <duch_kazatel> "memberEl: " + memberEl is coercing it.
[18:26:26] <duch_kazatel> you need to do memberEl
[18:26:29] <bobdobbs> oh sorry. It's "[object Object]"
[18:26:43] <bobdobbs> ah, ok
[18:27:11] <bobdobbs> phew, that's better. much relief.

[18:40:27] <duch_kazatel> BiHguy don't paste into the channe.
[18:40:32] <duch_kazatel> make a jsfiddle instead.
[18:40:41] <BiHguy> ok, sorry
[18:40:47] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 i sent you a link to the docs on mdn.
[18:40:51] <duch_kazatel> why didn't you read them?
[18:40:57] <jak2000> yes
[18:41:01] <jak2000> read
[18:41:06] <duch_kazatel> obviously you didn't.
[18:41:08] <jak2000> this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[18:41:37] <duch_kazatel> then you'd know that's not how you use bind.
[18:41:42] <duch_kazatel> also, you don't want a for loop here.
[18:41:48] <taplar> BiHguy: it looks like your doing this.x which isn't proper object notation in your case.  your probably after this[x]
[18:42:48] <duch_kazatel> also, jak2000 you don't want to do the timeout where you're doing it.
[18:43:15] <jak2000> ok too tested: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/acoa8Lku/2/
[18:43:22] <jak2000> duch_kazatel checking your advices...
[18:43:38] <duch_kazatel> please read the docs for bind.
[18:43:59] <jak2000> then the for is correct in the function: calculaGanador  right?
[18:44:03] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:44:05] <duch_kazatel> you don't want for at all.
[18:44:55] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/acoa8Lku/3/
[18:44:57] <duch_kazatel> this is what you want.
[18:46:47] <jak2000> yes...
[18:47:12] <jak2000> now i want stop when xContador =10
[18:47:12] <jak2000> thanks
[18:47:20] <duch_kazatel> should be pretty easy.
[18:51:20] <jak2000> tried: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/acoa8Lku/4/   :(
[18:51:40] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:52:30] <BiHguy> i want to make a Method with (argumentX) for an Object, and later that I can call object.method(argumentX), and that argument is Object.property ?
[18:52:31] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to run window.setTimeout(calculaGanador.bind(this, usuarios), 4000);
[18:52:51] <duch_kazatel> BiHguy taplar already gave you an answer :)
[18:55:08] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/acoa8Lku/7/   :)
[18:55:43] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 sure.
[18:55:57] <jak2000> but...
[18:56:06] <duch_kazatel> you want === though
[18:56:19] <jak2000> if (xContador===10)
[18:56:28] <jak2000> but the timer continue running?
[18:56:42] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't.
[18:57:09] <duch_kazatel> also you have a syntaxerror in your code.
[18:58:13] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/acoa8Lku/8/
[18:59:05] <bobdobbs> I do 'find()' on an dom element. I get back this: http://pastebin.com/TWCK7tQM
[18:59:13] <bobdobbs> How do I get the actual html out of that?
[18:59:17] <duch_kazatel> .html()
[18:59:31] <bobdobbs> oh geez. that sounds simple.
[18:59:34] <duch_kazatel> :)
[18:59:38] <bobdobbs> :D
[18:59:44] <taplar> do you want just the child html?
[18:59:54] <bobdobbs> yes
[18:59:54] <taplar> *child(ren)
[18:59:57] <taplar> k
[19:00:04] <jak2000> duch_kazatel thanks
[19:00:25] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 shoulda thanked me yesterday or whenever it was i gave you this fix ;)
[19:02:24] <jak2000> yes
[19:02:26] <jak2000> for the code
[19:02:29] <jak2000> man test: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/acoa8Lku/8/
[19:02:37] <jak2000> the first time you press button calcular work
[19:02:47] <jak2000> but press again.... and not count again
[19:03:02] <duch_kazatel> why do you think that is?
[19:03:05] <bobdobbs> If I replace find() with children() I get the same construct. I assume its an object.
[19:03:19] <duch_kazatel> bobdobbs it's a jquery object.
[19:03:22] <duch_kazatel> not the same methods though.
[19:03:23] <taplar> bobdobbs: yep, but it's not guarenteed to be the same result
[19:03:30] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[19:03:44] <diofeher> hey guys, how can I improve that for performance?  $('.btns').find('button.btn').click(function() { alert(this.innerHTML); });
[19:04:21] <taplar> diofeher: is it slow?
[19:04:54] <diofeher> nope, but someone said me that I still could improve that, but I can't see where
[19:05:00] <duch_kazatel> diofeher delegation.
[19:05:00] <bobdobbs> ok. If I do .html on that object that I get back, I get another object.
[19:05:06] <bobdobbs> I'm gonna pastebin my source...
[19:05:06] <diofeher> taplar,
[19:05:12] <duch_kazatel> bobdobbs make a fiddle ;)
[19:05:45] <bobdobbs> ok
[19:05:46] <taplar> diofeher: as duch said you can use a delegate.  i don't know that's your -see- a performance boost though
[19:05:54] <taplar> *that you'll
[19:06:03] <duch_kazatel> diofeher yeah you're not going to see a real performance increase.
[19:06:12] <duch_kazatel> also $('.btns').find('button.btn') doesn't make sense.
[19:06:21] <duch_kazatel> $('.btns') should be fine.
[19:06:26] <diofeher> duch_kazatel, taplar and what would be the difference using delegate?
[19:06:45] <duch_kazatel> diofeher delegated handlers bind a single listener and wait for events to bubble up.
[19:06:59] <duch_kazatel> but you'd have to totally rework your handler and what you're targeting.
[19:09:47] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/acoa8Lku/10/ done
[19:09:51] <jak2000> now much thanks
[19:09:55] <bobdobbs> I haven't used jsfiddle in years. I'm not really sure how to use it: https://jsfiddle.net/nf5b9gs2/
[19:09:59] <bobdobbs> But there's my code, anyway
[19:10:38] <duch_kazatel> bobdobbs so what's the problem you're having?
[19:10:52] <diofeher> duch_kazatel, I see, thanks.
[19:11:03] <bobdobbs> duch_kazatel: one sec. I think I've seen a possibly related bug. I'm gonna do a small clean up...
[19:11:46] <bobdobbs> ok: https://jsfiddle.net/nf5b9gs2/1/
[19:12:07] <duch_kazatel> you realize there's nothing in blocklink, right?
[19:12:18] <bobdobbs> So the issue: I'd like to get the html of $(".post-content")
[19:12:46] <duch_kazatel> the html or the text?
[19:12:55] <bobdobbs> the html
[19:13:22] <bobdobbs> Now, I do get something back with my current code. But I get back an object. And I don't know how to get the html from that object.
[19:14:23] <bobdobbs> Usually if I run a query using a dom traversal method  from the console I'll get something back that looks more like html.
[19:14:27] <duch_kazatel> one sec :)
[19:14:39] <bobdobbs> I used to do this stuff all the time . I've gotten very rusty
[19:15:35] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nf5b9gs2/3/
[19:16:06] <BiHguy> ok, so I need in  object method to use this[x] notation?
[19:16:20] <duch_kazatel> BiHguy make a fiddle.
[19:16:25] <duch_kazatel> it's really hard to follow along.
[19:21:52] <bobdobbs> aww, I was about to thank duch. but he went away
[19:24:43] <BiHguy> https://jsfiddle.net/e53v6xcb/4/
[19:25:17] <taplar> ok, so first, 'x' is undefined on line 15
[19:26:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e53v6xcb/5/ included jquery
[19:33:10] <BiHguy> ok, I can use firstStudent.show(fname); and fname is propetry of firstStudent object
[19:33:46] <taplar> you can so long as it is passed in as a string and accessed with this[variable]
[19:34:55] <taplar> or you could pass in the property and just alert on the variable
[19:36:13] <BiHguy> yes!!! first one is working
[19:36:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e53v6xcb/8/
[19:38:19] <BiHguy> thanks
[20:45:03] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm currently trying to force the activity of a certain plugin (jquery-number) to stop when I click a button is there any way to accomplish this?
[20:45:17] <neanderslob> more context to the question as well as an example are here in my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/neanderslob/pduLvzu1/11/
[20:45:27] <robertmaxrees> define "force the activity to stop"?
[20:45:55] <robertmaxrees> so you want the unformatted value?
[20:46:52] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: more precisely, I want the unformatted value to be pasted into the textbox and remain unchanged by the plugin after the button click
[20:47:33] <robertmaxrees> "i want the unformatted value to be pasted into the textbox" - you lost me.
[20:48:14] <robertmaxrees> you mean that it changes the value back when you try to fix it?
[20:48:45] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: yes, I believe that's what I mean
[20:49:44] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: jquery-number comma delimits the value, which is fantastic until I want to submit it
[20:50:02] <robertmaxrees> are you submitting this as a normal form or via ajax?
[20:50:16] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: normal form
[20:50:32] <robertmaxrees> jquery number overrides the default .val() behavior, so your stripping isn't doing anything.
[20:50:50] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: yep, that's the idea
[20:51:05] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: so is there a way that I can manually kill jquery-number?
[20:51:16] <robertmaxrees> you could have a hidden input that you put the real number in and then disable the input you have number tied to.
[20:51:48] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll have to replace the input entirely with an identical one.
[20:52:02] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: hah, yea I looked at that possibility, seems like a pain to do for all my numerical inputs
[20:52:14] <robertmaxrees> the plugin doesn't offer any alternative.
[20:53:35] <neanderslob> So you can't "kill" a plugin once it's been loaded?
[20:53:42] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[20:53:54] <neanderslob> I was afraid of that
[20:54:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd roll your own formatter or do something else tbh.
[20:54:32] <robertmaxrees> great case of a plugin not meeting your needs :)
[20:54:52] <neanderslob> yea, I think I'll pursue other plugin alternatives
[20:54:57] <neanderslob> thanks for having a look
[20:55:02] <robertmaxrees> sure\
