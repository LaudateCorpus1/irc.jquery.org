[00:31:41] <dblosevn> Hey anybody around?
[00:32:02] <dblosevn> GOt an issue Ive ran into a few time and have found a solution yet for
[00:32:49] <sammich> ?ask dblosevn
[00:33:31] <sammich> clearly the bot is on holiday
[00:34:13] <dblosevn> I am iframing a 360 model within a jquery mobile site, the 360 also is written with jquery mobile. and when a dialog pops inside the 360 its impossible to close it, jqm on the parent page takes over the events in the iframe somehow even though in this case its cross orgin im lost
[00:34:22] <dblosevn> http://lxedev.com/corephonegap/product-detail-360.html
[00:34:37] <dblosevn> click a hotspot then try to close it
[00:34:48] <dblosevn> sorry
[00:35:06] <dblosevn> click another tab then click 3d 360 then click a hotspot then try to close it
[00:36:20] <sammich> so I get the video/thing in the frame
[00:36:33] <sammich> and I click on the circle in the top left of that video area
[00:36:49] <dblosevn> ya it goes back a tab instead of closing the popup
[00:36:51] <sammich> it takes me to another frame, but it doesn't close the iframe
[00:37:26] <dblosevn> clicking the circle should show the 360 again
[00:37:52] <sammich> gotta say, the transistion direction is really throwing me ;)
[00:38:19] <dblosevn> ya i know imma fix that lol
[00:38:30] <dblosevn> the designer is still laying the pages out
[00:38:59] <dblosevn> if you look at http://assets.catkiosk.com/global/360/ipad/ap1000e-en-product-360.html youll see that the dialogs close when you click them
[00:39:20] <sammich> yeah, just did that
[00:39:24] <dblosevn> it works when in an iframe only when jquery mobile isnt on the parent page
[00:39:36] <sammich> why the iframing though, it's not super responsive
[00:39:59] <dblosevn> the content will be local on the device, and its an optional asset
[00:40:29] <dblosevn> I guess I could read the html file into a div with phonegap
[00:40:46] <sammich> I've not used phonegap, only jQM
[00:40:59] <sammich> vanilla, and only for one small proj so far
[00:41:00] <dblosevn> well its about the same
[00:41:21] <dblosevn> just your frontend and back end are the same entity for the most part
[00:41:50] <dblosevn> kind of like developing with node almost all the code is js
[00:41:53] <sammich> I'd probably try to ajax in the page
[00:41:57] <sammich> .load()
[00:42:31] <dblosevn> ya I considered that theres multiple versions of it being I cant make it responsive
[00:43:01] <dblosevn> Well I probally could but it would take a ton of work I couldnt gt approval for
[00:43:16] <dblosevn> the hotspot calculations mainly
[00:43:51] <sammich> ah, that's what phonegap is
[00:44:11] <sammich> those build one, port to many IDEs
[00:44:31] <dblosevn> there absolutely positioned in 36 spot which is totally dependant of the width and height being fixed
[00:45:21] <dblosevn> ya, I had to write a couple plugins for this so ill have to port the plugins to other platforms but the core of the app will be portable
[00:46:07] <dblosevn> Im suprised I am having this problem though being in this case the frame is cross orgin, I would think the iframe wouldnt have access to the parent document and viseversa
[00:47:19] <sammich> hmm, I don't know what could be happening, maybe a hashchange is kicking the parent page
[00:47:25] <dblosevn> although I may have CORS configured on assets.catkiosk.com cant rememeber and if I did its allowing *
[00:49:23] <dblosevn> wonder how much it would break it to upgrade jquery mobile on the 360
[00:50:27] <sammich> apparently there's gonna be a new version in the near future
[00:52:06] <dblosevn> these 360s are 2 years old lol they use 1.0
[00:52:26] <dblosevn> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/560 looks like others are having the issue
[00:52:26] <b-ot> dblosevn: Issue #560 by JamesNK (31mon 4w ago): jQuery Mobile + iframe causes the parent page to jump to the iframe when a link is clicked
[00:53:44] <sammich> from 2 years ago...hah
[00:54:02] <sammich> looks like you're SOL unless you build it into the source
[00:54:48] <dblosevn> ya, closed no fix
[00:59:13] <dblosevn> and im assuming that the close button on a jqm dialog fires window.history.back
[01:14:34] <ph88> is it possible to listen to a change of #something in an url and handle it like an event ?
[01:16:01] <dblosevn> Finally after over a year I figured that out lol
[01:16:20] <dblosevn> ?g jquery.hashchange @ ph88
[01:16:20] <b-ot> ph88: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery.hashchange @ ph88”.
[01:16:45] <dblosevn> ph88 https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange
[01:16:49] <ph88> lol dblosevn  :P  thx
[01:16:56] <dblosevn> bot failed lol
[01:17:11] <dblosevn> prolly was looking at the jquery docs though so it might have been my fail
[01:17:19] <ph88> oh 3 years old plugin :(
[01:17:26] <dblosevn> I used it recently
[01:17:37] <dblosevn> its only needed for browsers that dont support the event
[01:17:51] <ph88> like a polyfill ?
[01:17:56] <dblosevn> ya
[01:18:30] <ph88> how does it work without the polyfill ?  (in a browser that supports it)
[01:18:37] <ph88> i just listen to a  "hashchange
[01:18:37] <dblosevn> it uses an iframe hack on a timer to determine hashchange and fires a custom event
[01:18:39] <ph88> " event ?
[01:19:06] <dblosevn> ya but it wont work in older browsers hence the plugin
[01:19:14] <ph88> oh window.onhaschange ... ok
[01:19:27] <ph88> Introduced in Gecko 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6 / Thunderbird 3.1 / Fennec 1.0)
[01:19:35] <dblosevn> chrome supprots it
[01:19:36] <ph88> that's good enough for firefox
[01:19:40] <ph88> dunno about chrome yet
[01:19:51] <ph88> IE im not even gonna bother with :P
[01:19:54] <dblosevn> ie > 9 I think
[01:20:05] <ph88> ok all good then, i dont need the plugin ... ill bookmark it anyway though
[01:20:55] <ph88> thx man !
[01:21:06] <dblosevn> sammich: I figured it out
[01:21:25] <dblosevn> had to upgrade to jqm latest and set chageHash to false
[01:21:30] <sammich> ah, excellent
[01:21:34] <sammich> easy :)
[01:23:50] <okdamn> hey ho let's go!
[01:24:03] <okdamn> how do i disable page scrolling without using overflow:hidden?
[01:25:05] <dblosevn> thats an odd question care to explain
[01:25:10] <ryorky1> what is the easiest way to tell if a file has been dropped in a droppable zone?
[01:25:49] <dblosevn> $('file').change() ?
[01:26:00] <okdamn> dblosevn:  uh? :P
[01:26:10] <okdamn> i want to let the scroll bars but diable scrolling event
[01:26:13] <okdamn> on body
[01:26:39] <ph88> why not make a screenshot of the scrollbars and put them in as a picture ? :P
[01:27:03] <dblosevn> $('body').on('scrollstart', function() { return false; });
[01:28:16] <dblosevn> might want to add some conditions to that though so you can override it
[01:28:32] <dblosevn> that would effectively make the page not be able to scroll at all
[01:30:02] <dblosevn> oh ryorky1: you mean if a file was dropped in a drop zone thats not a file input?
[01:33:16] <okdamn> dblosevn:  scrollstart?? :P
[01:33:32] <dblosevn> its a jquery event
[01:33:34] <okdamn> i don't think scrollstart is supported o jquery
[01:33:37] <okdamn> sure? :O
[01:33:39] <boytoy_> http://jsbin.com vs http://codepen.io ...
[01:33:41] <okdamn> which jquery version? :O
[01:33:44] <dblosevn> ?g jquery.scrollstart
[01:33:44] <b-ot> dblosevn: scroll - jQuery scrollstart, scrollstop and very quick scrolling issue ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9739967/jquery-scrollstart-scrollstop-and-very-quick-scrolling-issue
[01:34:35] <okdamn> b-ot:  dblosevn but it's a work around script, jquery doesn't support scrollstart by default right?
[01:34:36] <b-ot> okdamn: my reply is no.
[01:34:56] <okdamn> b-ot:  as you want
[01:35:03] <dblosevn> lol
[01:35:12] <dblosevn> i found it in the pqm api
[01:35:19] <dblosevn> looking in jquery api
[01:35:20] <okdamn> dblosevn:  uh?
[01:35:24] <dblosevn> *jqm
[01:35:36] <dblosevn> http://api.jquerymobile.com/scrollstart/
[01:36:45] <ryorky1> dblosevn:  I just need to be able to detect if a file is dropped in a dropzone
[01:37:00] <okdamn> dblosevn:  it's jquery mobile!!!!!
[01:37:05] <okdamn> lol i'm on desktop
[01:37:30] <dblosevn> binding to the change event of the file input, should handle both dropping a file and a user browsing a file
[01:37:49] <dblosevn> okdamn: as I said im trying to find it in the query api
[01:37:56] <okdamn> dblosevn:  so you suggest on(scrollstart, return false; ) ?
[01:38:04] <okdamn> and return true; for re-enable ?
[01:38:13] <dblosevn> what is wrong with my j key
[01:38:25] <daslicht> http://screencast.com/t/O4yxUtmnkCSf
[01:38:25] <daslicht> when css animations are playing some parts of the webpage get less bright
[01:38:25] <daslicht> you can see it in my video : Watch the "AngularJS Animations" Fonts
[01:38:27] <daslicht> why?
[01:38:29] <daslicht> how to prevent such kind of ugly stuff?
[01:38:33] <daslicht> not jequery specific but probably somone here knows it?
[01:38:50] <dblosevn> ok guess I was wrong thats only in the mobile api
[01:38:55] <dblosevn> there are plugins though
[01:40:06] <dblosevn> http://james.padolsey.com/demos/scrollevents/scroll-startstop.events.jquery.js
[01:40:30] <dblosevn> and yes you would return true to allow scroll
[01:41:30] <dblosevn> daslicht: looks like a weird overscroll issue
[01:41:43] <daslicht> I mean the Font
[01:41:46] <dblosevn> oh
[01:41:53] <dblosevn> I read something on that yesterday
[01:41:55] <daslicht> the AngularJS font in teh heading
[01:42:02] <dblosevn> hold up ill find it
[01:42:04] <daslicht> i saw that on any css3 animation
[01:42:08] <daslicht> it looks so ugly
[01:43:07] <daslicht> see: http://www.nganimate.org/angularjs/ng-repeat/3d-scale
[01:43:12] <dblosevn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3461441/prevent-flicker-on-webkit-transition-of-webkit-transform
[01:43:32] <dblosevn> the only issue with that fix is it can crash some mobile browsers
[01:43:57] <dblosevn> the android browser in perticular
[01:44:18] <dblosevn> @ daslicht
[01:44:35] <daslicht> i look
[01:44:59] <daslicht> I think its a different issue
[01:45:17] <daslicht> since even non animated things look ugly
[01:45:22] <daslicht> anything on teh page gets affected
[01:45:27] <dblosevn> I have the issue on a project im builging now
[01:45:46] <dblosevn> ya my header flashes when I animate something else
[01:45:51] <daslicht> ugly
[01:45:54] <daslicht> soo ugly
[01:46:09] <dblosevn> -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; fixed it but force closed chrome on android
[01:46:22] <daslicht> aha
[01:47:05] <daslicht> i try ity
[01:47:13] <dblosevn> seems to only happen when i use woff fonts
[01:47:29] <daslicht> http://plnkr.co/edit/byMc6Xc7Z3JCCqSFJQIv?p=preview
[01:47:32] <daslicht> not working here
[01:47:36] <dblosevn> if i use ariel it doesnt
[01:49:39] <okdamn> hey oh let' s go!
[01:49:45] <dblosevn> ya it does http://plnkr.co/edit/4LgxPw2GULJTtXMBaiaM?p=preview
[01:50:20] <dblosevn> the nav bar doesnt resize during the transition anymore
[01:50:33] <dblosevn> I added a line to style.css
[01:51:39] <daslicht> cool
[01:51:43] <daslicht> hm me too
[01:51:48] <daslicht> let me have a look
[01:51:59] <daslicht> ahh
[01:52:01] <daslicht> I see
[01:52:06] <daslicht> cool
[01:52:10] <daslicht> thank you VERY much
[01:52:19] <daslicht> now I am more motivated to use css3 animations
[01:52:28] <dblosevn> np
[01:54:45] <okdamn> boostrap 3 relased
[01:54:47] <okdamn> check it out guys
[02:12:39] <aaairc> hey is jquery.metadata.js part of the core jquery, or is that a seperate plugin that I have to load?
[02:44:30] <mrHAT> ok, i have an element with contenteditable="true" where i want to restrict user input to only numbers, how can i do it ?
[04:51:21] <dblosevn> HEy guys got a question, I am trying to override jQuery with a macro and I am doing something wrong, http://dblosevn.chosd.com/184
[04:53:12] <dblosevn> basically I want to be able to user jQuery(selector) and it run through my macro first changing the scope to the active page in jqm
[04:53:47] <dblosevn> as well as optionally override the scope
[04:54:51] <s1n4> hey, how can I refresh my selector?
[04:55:09] <dblosevn> s1n4: ?
[04:57:18] <sammich> usually calling the selector again will do it
[04:57:36] <s1n4> dblosevn: I'm using bootstrap popover with a selector like this: '.cls:not(:contains('..'))' but popover doesnt realize when my element's content changed
[04:58:46] <s1n4> it doesnt behave as I want (after changing content of my element)
[04:59:13] <dblosevn> ?demo @ s1n4
[04:59:13] <b-ot> s1n4: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:59:49] <sammich> do you have event handlers bound to the elements?
[04:59:53] <sammich> that have changed?
[05:00:09] <dblosevn> need to know how the content changed and what the selector is meant to do when it does change to answer that question
[05:01:20] <s1n4> sammich: just a 'click' that will change the content
[05:01:42] <sammich> how does the bot work
[05:01:46] <sammich> ?docs
[05:01:55] <sammich> use .on()
[05:02:09] <dblosevn> ?jquery.on
[05:02:13] <dblosevn> ? jquery.on
[05:02:17] <dblosevn> i forgot lol
[05:02:21] <dblosevn> ?g jquery.on
[05:02:22] <b-ot> dblosevn: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:02:31] <sammich> ?g
[05:02:38] <sammich> which one is the right one?
[05:02:46] <dblosevn> ?g is google
[05:02:47] <b-ot> dblosevn: Is Google Making Us Stupid? - Nicholas Carr - The Atlantic → http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/
[05:03:04] <dblosevn> theres another command for jquery api
[05:03:11] <dblosevn> cant remember what it is
[05:03:28] <dblosevn> mdn is the mozzila mdn
[05:03:40] <s1n4> dblosevn: my workflow is something like: a click handler which calls ajax and change an element's content based on the response of ajax call
[05:04:47] <dblosevn> if the ajax response do you know that the selector should match? eg something like ret.showpopover = true?
[05:05:18] <dblosevn> *in the not if the
[05:06:13] <s1n4> what?
[05:07:12] <dblosevn> when your ajax callback fires do you know at that time is the selector should match?
[05:07:17] <s1n4> the selector matches before and after the ajax call, but it shouldnt match after the ajax response
[05:07:45] <dblosevn> so always after the response it should no longer match?
[05:08:13] <sammich> so, I'm guessing you know what the new selector should be?
[05:08:34] <dblosevn> instead of matching on content: match on a class thats there on page load and remove that class after the response
[05:08:40] <dblosevn> its a faster selector anyways
[05:08:53] <s1n4> dblosevn: yeah, it should no longer match
[05:09:28] <s1n4> sammich: the new selector is as the old one
[05:09:36] <dblosevn> hold on
[05:09:41] <sammich> I was just looking for how to remove a handler bound with .on()
[05:09:45] <sammich> I spent 1 minute googling this
[05:09:48] <sammich> and it hit me
[05:10:23] <s1n4> sammich: I suppose neither .on nor .live can help
[05:10:49] <sammich> I gotta say, I'm still not clear on what your intention/issue is here
[05:11:07] <s1n4> dblosevn: let me give it a shot
[05:12:18] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/urJaE/
[05:12:33] <dblosevn> @ s1n4
[05:13:04] <sammich> wait, can't you just use .off() then?
[05:13:14] <dblosevn> he could
[05:13:40] <Errietta> hi, i'm not sure how to explain it, but you now how facebook has the ability to show more posts/content as you scroll down? is there a pplugin (jquery or otherwise) that you know will do soemthing like that?
[05:13:43] <dblosevn> except I think .off only removes jquery events?
[05:13:59] <sammich> of course
[05:14:00] <dblosevn> and the selecotr is bootstrap
[05:14:09] <sammich> ah
[05:14:17] <sammich> well, use bootstrap?
[05:14:40] <dblosevn> I think my method would work reguardless
[05:15:02] <dblosevn> as the class will no longer exist on the element so the selector wont match
[05:15:31] <dblosevn> ?g jquery unlimited scroll @ Errietta
[05:15:32] <b-ot> Errietta: Planet freenode → http://planet.freenode.net/
[05:15:38] <dblosevn> grrr
[05:15:41] <dblosevn> ?g jquery unlimitedscroll @ Errietta
[05:15:41] <b-ot> Errietta: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery unlimitedscroll @ Errietta”.
[05:16:25] <Errietta> um ok i'll google for that :D
[05:16:29] <dblosevn> ?g jquery infinite scroll
[05:16:30] <b-ot> dblosevn: paulirish/infinite-scroll · GitHub → https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[05:16:39] <dblosevn> brains not awake yet lol
[05:16:45] <Errietta> right  thanks
[05:17:26] <dblosevn> np
[05:17:46] <dblosevn> oh wait I know why the issue still exists
[05:18:24] <dblosevn> because the events were bound at pageload when the selecotr matched just because the selector doesnt match anymore doesnt change the fact the the events are still bound to the element
[05:18:49] <dblosevn> youll have to use bootstrap to remove the events
[05:19:46] <sammich> yeah, that's because you're still thinking delegates
[05:20:48] <dblosevn> or you could $('element-that-shouldnt-trigger-popover-anymore').data('show', false);
[05:21:04] <dblosevn> and that will stop bootstrap form showing the popup again
[05:22:30] <dblosevn> s1n4: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14267054/bootstrap-how-to-remove-click-event-from-button last response
[05:23:46] <dblosevn> im tihnking I might break too much with my problem :-(
[05:24:04] <dblosevn> was hoping there was an easy way to make a macro around jQuery
[05:25:25] <dblosevn> to automatically change the scope
[05:25:43] <sammich> you mean context?
[05:25:43] <s1n4> dblosevn: thanks, I have to find another approach
[05:26:13] <dblosevn> s1n4: did you read the last comment on that post, that will solve your problem
[05:26:18] <s1n4> is it possible to do something when an element's content changed? is there any binding for changes?
[05:26:37] <sammich> mutate?
[05:26:37] <dblosevn> just add the data param after the response
[05:26:48] <sammich> use the callback?
[05:26:54] <dblosevn> I dont think elements have a change event if there not form fields
[05:27:16] <sammich> I was just reading about how you handle change events on contenteditable fields
[05:27:35] <dblosevn> that is basically a form field
[05:27:35] <s1n4> dblosevn: I did, but cant help
[05:27:52] <sammich> a div with onchange?
[05:28:18] <dblosevn> do something like $.get(url, function() { $(buttonselector).data('show', false); });
[05:28:29] <josefrichter> stupid question: what does a red line in safari inspector mean? I get 200 code, but the red files don't seem to load. see screenshot http://d.pr/i/bB5X
[05:28:51] <sammich> well, that's a 200 respose
[05:29:33] <dblosevn> seems your server is reporting errors as 200
[05:29:44] <dblosevn> red generally means a failed request
[05:30:05] <dblosevn> click on one of them and look at the response headers
[05:30:45] <s1n4> I found the way, thats DOMSubtreeModified, thanks a lot
[05:30:48] <josefrichter> dblosevn this is the response detail http://d.pr/i/2sAt
[05:31:33] <josefrichter> dblosevn any ideas? it's a jquerymobile webapp in iOS7 simulator. it works fine in iOS6 simulator, but fails to load resources in iOS7..
[05:32:07] <dblosevn> phonegap?
[05:33:14] <dblosevn> @ josefrichter if it is phonegap make sure you have <access origin="*" /> in your config.xml
[05:33:37] <josefrichter> dblosevn nonono phonegap :-)
[05:33:58] <josefrichter> pure html + jquery mobile running in iOS7 Safari
[05:34:03] <dblosevn> dunno then
[05:39:53] <josefrichter> dblosevn ok thanks anyway
[05:40:04] <zec_> http://jsfiddle.net/WQeua/ - Is it too extreme to make alias for the elements? (ex. FileInputs: $("#fileInputs")) ?
[05:41:26] <sammich> I think for #ids it might be overkill
[05:41:57] <sammich> but if it's for a set of elements that don't change much, should be worth it?
[05:52:16] <enthrops> How can I save and later restore an event handler?
[05:56:34] <dubphil> Hello, I have this code : http://jsfiddle.net/uzApR/2/ working on jsfiddle but not on my page, no error in the javascript console, how can I debug more ?
[06:04:40] <lord4163> How do I select like the first, second third and so on element?
[06:05:37] <sammich> slice()
[06:06:08] <sammich> .slice(0, 2)
[06:06:18] <sammich> oh, just one, is eq()
[06:08:17] <lord4163> sammich: $('nav a').eq(0).css('color: #E01B5D;'); ?
[06:12:09] <sammich> css('stylename', 'value')
[06:15:34] <lord4163> sammich: yeah found that :P\
[06:43:27] <dubphil> I'm pulling my hair... is it possible that a toggled div (visible/invisible when click) prevent something in this div to give a click event ?
[06:45:42] <dubphil> this code works well in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/uzApR/2/ but in my document, it is a dynamically filled div with a toggled behavior
[06:46:57] <dubphil> I see the div and it's elements in bugzilla, but when I click on one element the alert doesn't show, any idea ? The code is in the ready() function already
[06:47:26] <dubphil> no error in the javascript console, i'm lost :(
[06:58:12] <jop008> What is the most common javascrit version running in all main browsers?
[07:08:11] <jop008> I think 1.5
[07:08:45] <jop008> having a list with methods on it use the prototype to  add method to the list (list is an array)
[07:09:32] <jop008> methods on the list are delete add update entries
[08:03:25] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[08:04:03] <Bloomberg> Someone could help me to refresh my jtable when I select a filter option in a left side list?
[08:04:12] <Bloomberg> http://www.jtable.org/apireference#met-reload
[08:21:37] <Bloomberg> someone here plz?
[08:21:38] <Bloomberg> hey
[08:33:36] <dinopetrone> writing a jquery plugin and i'm curious if it's best practice to namespace my functions like:
[08:33:48] <dinopetrone> $('.fb').social.facebook(options)
[08:33:53] <dinopetrone> $('.fb').social.twitter(options)
[08:33:58] <dinopetrone> etc
[08:34:07] <dinopetrone> or if should go without the .social
[08:40:50] <dinopetrone> yeah…namespacing :) ty
[08:41:11] <dabear> tell me how that could work:p
[08:41:29] <dabear> use socialFacebook(options) instead
[09:26:00] <Barelds> Hello, not sure if this is quite the right place... But I just wrote my first jquery plugin- and since it's my first I probably did a bunch of thigns wrong. Where do I go to share it and/or get feedback?
[09:44:44] <zok> I have a button I want to bind a click event to. When the button is clicked, I want it to force a <select> to have one of it's <option> tags become selected.
[09:44:57] <zok> I know how ot bind the click event to the button - but how do I make it select an option?
[10:04:08] <Barelds> zok: still here?
[10:04:13] <Barelds> still need help with that?
[10:08:12] <zok> Nope, I think I got it :)
[10:08:14] <zok> Thanks though!
[10:10:19] <zok> Apparently I needed to use attr() or prop()
[10:10:23] <zok> attr seemed to do the trick
[10:15:08] <dubphil> hello ! I'm coding a chat and I use a javascript function that ask every second to the server if there is a new message the problem is that it make a mysql query every second even if there is no new message.
[10:15:41] <dubphil> is there a way to store the last message_id and check if there is a new ?
[10:15:53] <dubphil> how can I store this last id ?
[10:16:42] <intellix> I guess this is more a PHP/MySQL question rather than JS :D
[10:16:58] <intellix> as if you're storing this information on the client, you're going to get royally abused
[10:17:12] <intellix> yeah… the last message I received was one from 10 years ago....
[10:17:31] <dubphil> intellix: yes I think, in a session variable then
[10:17:45] <dubphil> thanks
[10:17:51] <Barelds> dubphil: something you could consider doing (assuming you're confident your server won't be troubled by it)
[10:17:56] <intellix> actually, lemme check how I implemented mine :D I can't remember
[10:18:08] <Barelds> is making your ajax requests wait when there is no new text
[10:18:29] <intellix> I doubt this is the best implementation, but I have a chat that does that on here (sorry for the plug): http://www.konoro.org/
[10:18:43] <intellix> when you login, theres a chat button and you can check the console there :P
[10:18:55] <Barelds> ie: while(!new_messages) { new_messages = get_messages(); sleep(1000); }   (or whatever)
[10:19:19] <intellix> ah, I'm doing: last_id=12312
[10:19:20] <Barelds> it will give you faster responses, less requests, but unfortunately more concurrent connections
[10:20:04] <intellix> the absolute best solution is publish/subscribe really but….. :P
[10:20:12] <dubphil> storing the last id in a session var is better I think finally
[10:21:58] <Barelds> is this at all a place to get feedback on plugins written or anything like that? I just finished writing my first jquery plugin
[10:22:07] <Barelds> and I've surprisingly quite pleased with the result
[10:30:45] <e-anima> hi all
[10:32:20] <dubphil> it is impossible in fact with php session variable
[10:40:43] <e-anima> how would i save a value in an span so i can usi it with some js hover stuff. i used <span itemid=1></span> but thats not valid html any tips?
[10:41:15] <Soraka> Anyone can help me integrate in my script a Load More button? i need guide where to place the code, i am trying to solve this for couple of days
[10:41:28] <Soraka> I understood some parts of how it works tho.. i cannot get it working
[10:47:47] <Soraka> anyone can help me with a load more button? thankz
[10:49:11] <Guest79067> any help with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17900039/vertical-and-horizontal-align-of-divs
[10:49:36] <Soraka> Any help with load more ? - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17891688/add-load-more-button-to-my-list-that-i-fetch-from-database
[10:50:57] <V8Energy> is there something like this: $("#slideshowu*") - basically return all the elements which have  an id that contains "slideshowu"?
[10:55:35] <Soraka> anyone there that can help with load more button integration?
[10:57:09] <ph88> V8Energy: you shouldn't have multiple html with the same ID .. use classes instead
[10:57:34] <Soraka> ph8 can you help me too please
[10:57:41] <Soraka> with load more button situation
[10:57:44] <Soraka> i am stack here:(
[10:58:51] <Barelds> e-anima:
[10:58:59] <Barelds> you should use data-blabla="stuff"
[10:59:06] <e-anima> thx
[10:59:07] <Barelds> prefix your custom data tag with data-
[10:59:18] <ph88> Soraka:  you use php ?
[10:59:43] <Soraka> yes sir i use php and jquery
[10:59:48] <Soraka> so its implicated for me
[10:59:56] <Soraka> i am null in jquery
[10:59:59] <Soraka> i know basic php
[11:00:00] <Barelds> v8Energy
[11:00:01] <Barelds> there is
[11:00:04] <Barelds> but its different
[11:00:13] <ph88> Soraka: you should break your problem down in smaller steps and ask smaller concrete questions about the problems you run into
[11:00:23] <Barelds> you would do something like $("[Id^=blabla")
[11:00:29] <Barelds> not 100% sure of ^= is the correct one
[11:00:32] <Barelds> going to look it up
[11:00:50] <Soraka> I see, ph8 that makes sense, well my first problem is my content is created by Jquery in my container
[11:01:01] <Soraka> How can i add on top of that a Load More button?
[11:01:13] <Soraka> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17891688/add-load-more-button-to-my-list-that-i-fetch-from-database
[11:01:32] <ph88> V8Energy:  i misunderstood the question  ... like Barelds  says it's  "[id^=slideshowu]"
[11:02:04] <Barelds> I think that should work, havent found it though
[11:02:20] <ph88> Soraka:  what's your container ?
[11:02:33] <Soraka> Its my content box or how to call it, a div id=results
[11:02:49] <Soraka> and with ajax it generates a list <li = ...
[11:02:57] <ph88> why is that a problem that your content is created in your container ?
[11:03:01] <Barelds> Sorake $("bla").append("html");
[11:03:20] <Soraka> Yes i did that and managed to add the Button Load More but now
[11:03:30] <Soraka> my ajax is looping until all results are received
[11:03:36] <Soraka> shall i pastebin the ajax code?
[11:03:39] <Barelds> sure
[11:03:40] <Soraka> so you can see what i talk about?
[11:03:41] <Soraka> ok
[11:04:11] <Soraka> AJAX CODE - http://pastebin.com/rvaZQFse
[11:04:28] <Barelds> just a heads up
[11:04:29] <Barelds> you can do
[11:04:34] <Barelds> $.post({bla bla
[11:04:36] <ph88> show your php code too
[11:04:41] <Soraka> my php isset -> http://pastebin.com/8VHwT616
[11:04:51] <Soraka> hm, check my php too first
[11:04:56] <Soraka> i do a isset for $.ajax
[11:05:04] <Soraka> and there we have the SQL baby that gets content
[11:05:07] <Soraka> now what i need is
[11:05:21] <Soraka> to implement into this code somewhere the load more function and button
[11:05:34] <ph88> repaste of the JS code:  http://pastebin.com/14wfgPGH
[11:05:52] <Barelds> to "load more"
[11:05:55] <Barelds> basically you need 3 things
[11:06:04] <Soraka> Ok, i am all ears :D
[11:06:09] <Barelds> 1: the id / timestamp of your latest data
[11:06:13] <ph88> repaste PHP code:  http://pastebin.com/FtwJYKuH
[11:06:41] <Barelds> 2: tell the server: give me everything newer than [result from step 1]
[11:07:02] <Barelds> 3: add it, and update your "latest data" bit
[11:07:09] <Soraka> I know the logic Barelds, i read a lot about it but my issue here is i dont know any jquery almost at all
[11:07:24] <Soraka> and i am worried i will "ruin all" because
[11:07:28] <Soraka> i have no clue where to add this steps
[11:07:45] <ph88> Soraka: both your PHP and your javascript are not very good code
[11:07:51] <Soraka> oh:(
[11:07:54] <Soraka> that is bad news
[11:08:04] <Barelds> you could do something like
[11:08:15] <Soraka> i bought it.. hoped it was profeesionally done..
[11:09:03] <Barelds> if only your jquery isnt so good, you could try something like
[11:09:07] <Soraka> pretty disappointed to hear that.. maybe later you can point me out what is bad done, but now for this load more...
[11:09:23] <Soraka> yes i know little more php, i understand it
[11:09:30] <Soraka> 70% :P
[11:09:36] <ph88> Soraka: the code is very noob ... less then amature
[11:09:42] <Soraka> wah... :|
[11:09:44] <Barelds> var lastId = $("#container > div").last().attr("data-id");
[11:09:44] <Barelds> $.post("url", {data}, function(data) {
[11:09:44] <Barelds> $("#container").append(data);
[11:09:44] <Barelds> });
[11:09:51] <ph88> amateur *
[11:10:02] <Barelds> it's not super elegant, but it's very simple and should be easy to adjust your other code to
[11:10:11] <Soraka> ok so
[11:10:14] <Soraka> what you do here
[11:10:32] <Soraka> in the example you sent me
[11:10:47] <Soraka> you add a attribute
[11:10:50] <Soraka> or what exactly
[11:10:54] <Soraka> and then append data to the container?
[11:10:56] <Barelds> I assume all your data items are put inside an element with the Id="container"
[11:11:19] <Soraka> yes mine is id=results but w/e same
[11:11:20] <Barelds> inside that container all your data items are, each data item is a <div> with data-id="number"
[11:11:36] <Soraka> at mine is <li>
[11:11:39] <Soraka> but lets say its a div
[11:11:55] <Barelds> now the first line basically finds the last Id for you that's inside #container (or #result)
[11:12:04] <Soraka> <li id='l_555' class='clinic_list'>
[11:12:07] <Soraka> smth like that
[11:12:24] <Barelds> $.post("url", { id: lastId } , function(data) { ....
[11:12:36] <Soraka> so last id, its like last-child in CSS?
[11:12:41] <Soraka> it knows the last to pick?
[11:12:41] <Barelds> yes
[11:12:44] <Soraka> ok nice
[11:13:00] <Barelds> ideally the id should be numeric so that you can more safely sort it
[11:13:12] <Soraka> yes well the last id lets say its 10
[11:13:16] <Soraka> since i fetch 10 results right?
[11:13:19] <Soraka> by default
[11:13:29] <Barelds> if you give it the id 10, then sure
[11:13:32] <jimi_> es que si o es que no
[11:13:36] <ph88> jimi_: english
[11:13:46] <jimi_> ph88, what's up?
[11:13:47] <jimi_> oh
[11:13:49] <ph88> o_O
[11:13:55] <jimi_> n/m lol i thought i was typing in another window
[11:13:59] <ph88> lol
[11:14:04] <Soraka> I see, well then how i send this number that i found out from lastId
[11:14:09] <Soraka> to the SQL to continue the fetch
[11:14:16] <Barelds> ph88, any chance you could have a look at a jquery plugin I wrote and give me your thoughts?
[11:14:21] <ph88> oki
[11:14:28] <Soraka> D:
[11:14:28] <Barelds> in $.post
[11:14:33] <Barelds> you have a data attribute
[11:14:34] <Barelds> so:
[11:15:03] <Barelds> $.post(YourUrlHere, { your data } , function(data) { your result handler });
[11:15:08] <Barelds> your data in this case is:
[11:15:16] <Soraka> 10
[11:15:17] <Barelds> { last_id: lastId }
[11:15:18] <Soraka> or?
[11:15:19] <Barelds> now in PHP
[11:15:26] <Barelds> you can do $_POST["last_id"]
[11:15:30] <Barelds> to get your Id
[11:15:55] <Barelds> you said you have <li> items right?
[11:15:55] <Soraka> i see, uhm pretty complex
[11:15:58] <Soraka> yeah
[11:16:26] <Soraka> my content gets generated with <li> </li> that have some classes
[11:16:30] <Barelds> if you could make your <li> items into <li data-id="1"></li><li data-id="2"></li> etc etc
[11:16:45] <Barelds> then you could get the last Id from that
[11:17:12] <Soraka> yes but not sure what i do
[11:17:14] <Soraka> with this last id
[11:17:21] <Soraka> i must $_POST
[11:17:25] <Soraka> it in the load more?
[11:17:25] <ph88> what kind of items are they ?
[11:17:27] <Soraka> to continue?
[11:17:41] <Soraka> ph8 you talk with me or about the plugin Barelds made?
[11:17:47] <ph88> with you
[11:17:57] <Soraka> Ok, its a list of results from Google Map
[11:18:05] <Soraka> with store locator
[11:18:14] <Soraka> that is added in my database
[11:18:31] <Soraka> so i fetch all of them nice atm, but its bad if 10.000 stores are;p
[11:18:36] <Soraka> to fetch all 10.000 at each refresh
[11:18:39] <Soraka> its stupid
[11:18:48] <Barelds> yeah
[11:19:00] <Soraka> will kill my "bad script" in 5 seconds:D
[11:19:07] <Soraka> so i try to think to optimize it or smth
[11:19:13] <Soraka> to hold some traffic.. hopefully
[11:19:14] <ph88> how much you paid for it ? o_O
[11:19:16] <scar> im using bx slider and have mutliple sliders on 1 page. im using an outside pager using the bx slider control functions such as .goToPrevSlide() -- how can i manage these sliders all on one page? is it possible to create a variable say foo5, and access foo5.goToPrevSlide() but in a manner such as foo + the_id_needed.goToPrevSlide() ?
[11:19:36] <Soraka> 25$ not much its already a templated by google made similar to this
[11:19:43] <Soraka> but this person made from that
[11:19:45] <Soraka> this one
[11:19:47] <scar> i suppose i could have broken that up into 2 separate questions since the 2nd question is less-specific to BX
[11:20:09] <Soraka> Barelds how much would you request for help me add this load more via Team Viewer? if you do sort of things
[11:20:16] <Soraka> or ph8.. any of you who can handle it
[11:20:37] <ph88> scar:  use the dom element you bind your bx slider to to reference the slider you want
[11:20:42] <Barelds> soraka
[11:20:57] <Barelds> it's only a button with "show more"?
[11:21:02] <Soraka> yes
[11:21:06] <Soraka> I mean to work show more
[11:21:14] <Soraka> not just the button, but also to load each time you press
[11:21:15] <Soraka> 10 more posts
[11:21:26] <scar> ph88, so $('.my_slide5').goToNextSlide() is the same as var my_slide5 = $('.my_slide5).bx_slider(); my_slide5.goToNextSlide() ?
[11:21:34] <Barelds> how about this, I help you and you give me however much it's worth to you :p
[11:21:54] <Barelds> as in, you dont have to break your bank
[11:22:04] <Barelds> just pay what you feel is reflected in the result
[11:22:30] <ph88> scar: my_slide5 = $('.my_slide5).bx_slider();  then if you do my_slide5.goToNextSlide()   it will be as if you do: $('.my_slide5).bx_slider().goToNextSlide();
[11:22:41] <ph88> so it's not the same as $('.my_slide5').goToNextSlide()
[11:22:51] <scar> ph88, well i dont want to re-initiate the bxSlider
[11:23:01] <Soraka> Yes, i personal messaged you
[11:23:04] <scar> i'll be using the goToNextSlide with on click
[11:23:05] <Soraka> Can you talk there?
[11:23:26] <ph88> scar: you have to read the bx slider documentation and find out how you can call methods on your bx slider
[11:24:00] <ph88> Soraka: start a new irc chatroom for you, Barelds and me
[11:26:40] <scar> ph88, so can i create a variable like foo + my_id = $('.slider').bxSlider() ?
[11:26:54] <scar> then reference (foo + my_id).goToNextSlide() ?
[11:28:00] <ph88> scar:  look at the bottom here Public Methods http://bxslider.com/options  there is examples of what you want
[11:28:20] <scar> ph88, yes i understand, but i have multipel sliders so i need specific ids created
[11:28:34] <scar> outside of bx slider, can i creat a variable name using + ?
[11:29:08] <ph88> scar:  you can use 1 jquery selector for all your sliders probably. Then you can loop on those elements with each. Attach a new slider to each of them ... and reference that with a variable you put in an array
[11:29:21] <ph88> or you can write for every slider like you see in the example ...
[11:30:01] <scar> ph88, but the list i need is dynamic. it loops thru categories. if a category is added, i need the slider to auto populate
[11:30:26] <scar> ill probably loop thru each slider and also use the output of the html to generate ids starting at 1 or 0 then follow thru with jquery maybe
[11:30:30] <ph88> scar: show some code of how the categories are created
[11:30:43] <scar> simple foreach() loop in php, for this example
[11:31:12] <ph88> then you need to put that list of categories as a json so you can make a array out of it
[11:31:21] <scar> hm
[11:35:59] <ph88> scar: im making something
[11:37:32] <scar> hmm
[11:40:18] <ph88> scar: http://pastebin.com/p9UcUcVu
[11:42:02] <ph88> scar: only thing that code does not do is to place the new element in the DOM ... so that still needs to be done some way
[11:43:20] <scar> hm
[11:43:46] <scar> creating an aarray of sliders
[11:43:51] <ph88> why not
[11:44:12] <ph88> it depends on the code you already have
[11:44:14] <ph88> which i dont know
[11:44:17] <scar> no im saying thats perfect i think
[11:44:23] <scar> bc i can easily use an integer slit
[11:44:53] <ph88> you need to figure out where you want to sliders in your layout
[11:45:02] <ph88> if you want all of them to be in the #container box
[11:45:04] <ph88> then you can do
[11:45:10] <scar> on('click', function() { the_slot = $(this).attr('data-slide-slot'); slider[the_slot].goToNextSlide();  });
[11:45:15] <scar> can that work?
[11:45:17] <ph88> $('#container').append(el);
[11:46:01] <ph88> if the_slot is an integer from 0 counting up ...
[11:46:25] <ph88> or you can have a list of slot names and use that as id's to your sliders
[11:46:50] <ph88> Soraka, Barelds: how is it going ?
[11:50:18] <scar> ph88, why can i not do $.each('.my_sliders', function() { $(this).bxSlider(); }); ?
[11:50:33] <fschuindt> Guys, I have a block in my code "$gallery_container.scrollPagination({", it calls a plugin for scroll pagination, but I want to stop the execution of this block/plugin execution when certain variable gets false. I don't have idea how to make it :/
[11:51:02] <scar> ph88, oops pastd weird
[11:51:27] <ph88> scar:  i didn't know you already had <ul>'s in place that you want to turn into a slider ... so in the code i wrote i was creating them on the fly. You can do that too
[11:52:55] <scar> ph88, http://jsfiddle.net/E8K6j/
[11:53:01] <scar> am i doing it wrong?
[11:53:53] <scar> nvm forgot parenthesis
[11:53:53] <scar> lol
[11:54:07] <ph88> var all_sliders  !=  $all_sliders
[12:02:03] <ph88> scar: if you make the elements before hand .... how do you match the amount of elements with the amount of categories you get form the server ?  you just leave some of the <ul>'s unused ?
[12:03:04] <scar> ph88, here's what i did
[12:04:08] <scar> http://pastebin.com/VgZ490tW
[12:04:43] <scar> data-feed-id was generated with the php using a simple  count var that  $count++; would increase in the loop
[12:05:44] <ph88> ye that's nice
[12:05:55] <ph88> all_sliders  don't need to create this variable though
[12:06:07] <ph88> but aside from that your code looks solid
[12:06:21] <ph88> line 17 & 23 : put var
[12:06:38] <ph88> line 4 too
[12:07:59] <scar> sweet
[12:08:05] <scar> didnt think of placing them in array and using int slots
[12:08:08] <scar> thanks ph88
[12:08:17] <scar> i was trying to dynamically  create a car name
[12:08:21] <scar> var
[12:08:47] <ph88> np scar http://pastebin.com/FBQf0cVa
[12:09:28] <scar> ph88, why globalize the feed_id ?
[12:09:50] <ph88> eh var is just for that local function scope, no ?
[12:10:21] <ph88> put on line 22    var a = 'b';  and put a breakpoint there ... then see if feed_id exist
[12:14:04] <ph88> that var a = 'b'; is just for clarity that it's really halting on line 22 and hasn't entered the code at line 23 yet
[12:21:51] <Whirl3d> What's the new alternative to jsfiddle...I thought it was csbin, but it's not.
[12:22:13] <Whirl3d> okay, I am retarded. Sorry

[12:47:56] <amaroks_> hi
[12:53:00] <mhahn> i'm trying to trigger a custom event only once
[12:53:09] <mhahn> i have a watcher that watches for an element to appear on the page via setInterval
[12:53:10] <mhahn> if ($(selector).length) {
[12:53:10] <mhahn>     $(selector).trigger('elFound');
[12:53:10] <mhahn> }
[12:53:10] <mhahn> $(selector).one('elFound', function(event) {
[12:53:10] <mhahn>     console.log('found element: ' + selector);
[12:53:11] <mhahn> })
[12:53:41] <mhahn> that is always logging "found element" though, i though it would only happen once due to use of "one"
[13:04:38] <terrycojones> I just released a more flexible version of $.when in case anyone's interested http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/terry/2013/07/27/jquery-when2-a-more-flexible-way-to-work-with-jquery-deferreds/
[13:04:49] <gregtom6> hy all
[13:05:18] <terrycojones> It lets you collect all results (including errors) or resolve on first success, along with the normal $.when behavior of rejecting on first error.
[13:10:58] <gregtom6> I wanted to use a function popover: $('.eventPresent').popover({  I have declared the function in a javascript: !function ($) {"use strict";var Popover = function (element, options) {this.init('popover', element, options)} etc.
[13:11:58] <gregtom6> Why the browser says: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'popover'  ???
[13:13:02] <polishnorbi> I'm looking for a simple image slideshow plugin, that I can reload with new images based on a button click. Any suggestions?
[13:18:50] <ogk1000> anyone have a good way to get some tweets displayed on a site? tried using this but its broken http://www.queness.com/post/14004/easiest-way-to-retrieve-twitter-timeline-and-hashtags-twitter-oauth-api-11/page/2
[13:21:54] <JoshBlease> Can anyone help me with the flot plugin?
[13:23:53] <JoshBlease> I want to color each bar in a bar chart on its own, like this example but with the true bar being green http://joshblease.co.uk/Maths/Admin/chart.php#graph3
[13:25:44] <JoshBlease> I want to color each bar in a bar chart on its own, like this example but with the true bar being green http://joshblease.co.uk/Maths/Admin/chart.php#graph3
[13:42:31] <JoshBlease> Does anyone now how to colour each bar in a flot bar graph?
[13:46:19] <dblosevn> is there a way to clear the history stack in jqm?
[13:48:36] <ryanneufeld> dblosevn: I don't think so
[13:49:07] <dblosevn> ya i see a method to clear it going forward but not back
[13:49:33] <ryanneufeld> AFAIK and I could be mistaken, jqm uses pushState when available
[13:49:57] <dblosevn> $.mobile.urlHistory.clearForward()
[13:50:11] <dblosevn> seems to cler everything forward of the current page
[13:50:56] <ryanneufeld> $.mobile.urlHistory.stack
[13:51:32] <Dorfrod> can someone evaluate my function and help me understand why it isn't adding anything to the #result div http://pastebin.com/bW82vPrk
[13:51:43] <dblosevn> ya im looking at that in the console now wondering how to not break it but clear it lol
[13:52:24] <dblosevn> I should probally store the current page in the stack then empty the stack and add the current page back
[13:53:30] <ryanneufeld> dblosevn: yeah, I'm not sure messing with the stack is such a great idea though
[13:53:37] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz ^^
[13:54:05] <dblosevn> I want my phonegap app to exit if the back button is pressed when on the main screen of the app
[13:54:18] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: you can use data.result instead of data['result']
[13:54:49] <dblosevn> the only way it will do that is if its the first page in the stack and cant go back anymore
[13:55:45] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: also, without seeing your html it's hard to help
[13:55:55] <ryanneufeld> ?fiddle
[13:55:59] <Dorfrod> alright... jsfiddle coming up
[13:57:43] <Dorfrod> http://jsfiddle.net/z3atb/
[14:00:33] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: http://jsfiddle.net/z3atb/1/
[14:00:42] <ryanneufeld> I made a couple changes to your JS
[14:00:43] <ryanneufeld> try that
[14:00:46] <ryanneufeld> and watch your console
[14:01:40] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: Also, i recommend binding to the submit event
[14:01:47] <ryanneufeld> and not click on the button
[14:02:03] <Dorfrod> alright.  what changes did you make?
[14:02:19] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/z3atb/2/
[14:02:39] <ryanneufeld> I changed it from using the submit callback
[14:02:44] <ryanneufeld> to using .done()
[14:02:51] <ryanneufeld> and added .fail()
[14:03:09] <ryanneufeld> also changed it to be on submit of the form instead of onclick of the submit button
[14:03:20] <ryanneufeld> that way it works if a user hit's enter to submit
[14:07:39] <Dorfrod> ok... now i don't understand what the console just shot at me
[14:08:10] <thin> could someone tell me why the 2nd alert() does not work in IE9 http://jsbin.com/avelox/2/edit
[14:08:27] <TeddyMurray> sure let me check it out
[14:09:17] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: pastbine the output
[14:10:08] <TeddyMurray> oh
[14:10:12] <TeddyMurray> thin
[14:10:43] <TeddyMurray> nvm
[14:11:20] <thin> yo
[14:11:21] <TeddyMurray> for some reason i think its script sh
[14:11:22] <Dorfrod> http://pastebin.com/Wm4SLGAF
[14:11:23] <TeddyMurray> <script type="text/javascript">
[14:11:44] <TeddyMurray> when i changed it to that, it worked fine
[14:11:52] <thin> if that was the case neither of the alerts would run.
[14:12:04] <TeddyMurray> try to change it, it works
[14:12:12] <thin> brb trying
[14:13:23] <ryanneufeld> Dorfrod: http://jsfiddle.net/z3atb/3/
[14:13:25] <ryanneufeld> try that
[14:14:19] <thin> TeddyMurray: updated http://jsbin.com/avelox/6/edit
[14:14:25] <thin> still only 1 alert in IE9
[14:14:32] <thin> 2 alerts in firefox and chrome
[14:14:47] <TeddyMurray> press run with js in the top right corner
[14:16:41] <thin> http://jsbin.com/avelox/6/edit  This is only giving 1 alert in IE9
[14:17:06] <thin> Are you running it in IE9?
[14:25:32] <thin> anyone else have any idea?
[14:47:22] <Barelds> anyone still here?
[14:51:38] <Dorfrod> and i'm just an idiot
[14:52:05] <Barelds> nothing wrong with being an idiot ;)
[14:53:48] <Gazpacho> what do you want barelds
[14:58:14] <Barelds> o_o @ Gazpacho, mostly just feedback on a jquery plugin I wrote
[14:58:31] <ph88> Barelds: how did it go with Soraka  ?
[14:58:34] <Gazpacho> hmm, i can't help there
[14:58:50] <Barelds> @ ph88, pretty well, I solved most of his problems I think
[14:59:09] <Barelds> code was pretty messy
[14:59:33] <Barelds> but some things will simply have to take their time
[15:13:54] <grafi> what plugin?
[15:16:41] <Barelds> can I link here?
[15:16:51] <grafi> i dont see why not
[15:16:57] <Barelds> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/visual-timer-plugin-my-first-jquery-plugin-feedback-wanted
[15:17:18] <Barelds> there are (or used to be) quite a lot of channels where posting links was against the roles and bots would auto-kick you
[15:17:34] <Barelds> I frankly havent used IRC in around 8 to 10 years
[15:19:06] <grafi> oh well, you are still here
[15:19:10] <grafi> so its probably okay :P
[15:19:30] <Barelds> hehe
[15:22:09] <Barelds> are you having a look grafi?
[15:22:23] <grafi> looking at it :P
[15:22:32] <grafi> why dont you use github?
[15:22:38] <grafi> or something similar
[15:22:46] <grafi> where i can view the code online :P
[15:23:13] <Barelds> im a nab o_o
[15:23:22] <Barelds> ill go throw this on github, 1 sec
[15:23:28] <Barelds> (or more, probably)
[15:26:42] <grafi> im just saying, downloading and extracting can be barrier for people wanting to look at the code
[15:27:03] <grafi> apparently people are lazy
[15:29:08] <Barelds> I agree, just setting it up takes me a while- dont have a whole lot of experience using git
[15:30:57] <grafi> yeah that was a pain for me too
[15:31:17] <grafi> especially generating the ssh keys on windows
[15:33:44] <Barelds> https://github.com/wimbarelds/TimeCircles
[15:34:22] <Barelds> I should probably have moved the git repos a few folder down >_<
[15:34:36] <grafi> hrhr
[15:37:38] <Barelds> also added the github in the thread
[15:38:44] <grafi> that will probably help getting feedback
[15:38:47] <grafi> i'd imagine
[15:41:22] <Barelds> oh wow
[15:41:29] <Barelds> bootstrap 3 rc1 came out?
[15:41:35] <Barelds> when did that happen
[15:41:57] <Barelds> I would guess recently since the download button doesnt work o_o
[15:42:22] <grafi> hm i read about that today
[15:42:29] <grafi> so hopefully pretty recently
[15:42:49] <grafi> if the date is in the past the plugin counts up?
[15:43:51] <Barelds> yeah
[15:43:53] <grafi> that confused me for a second looking at the examples :P
[15:44:07] <grafi> but cool
[15:44:17] <grafi> if only i had something to count to ...
[15:44:19] <Barelds> you can set data-date (past or present), and you can also set data-timer (time from now in seconds)
[15:44:31] <Barelds> if you use the timer
[15:44:46] <Barelds> then start/stop will actually stop/start the timer
[15:45:02] <Barelds> with data-date it will jump ahead if it's been stopped for a while and you start it
[15:45:11] <Barelds> since, well- you didnt actually stop time itself :p
[15:45:16] <grafi> ill pick the lowest hanging feedback fruit and tell you that some kind of readme that explains this a bit would be a good idea
[15:45:21] <grafi> documentation and such
[15:45:23] <grafi> :P
[15:45:37] <Barelds> yeah absolutely agree
[15:45:53] <Barelds> I started work on this I think thursday or wednesday
[15:45:53] <grafi> you should also pick a license for the plugin, so that others can actually use it
[15:46:08] <grafi> yeah i know how it is
[15:46:42] <Barelds> it wasnt inutially a jquery plugin (you can see from the _plain.js)
[15:47:01] <Barelds> initially**
[15:47:10] <grafi> yup
[15:47:22] <Barelds> there is some basic stuff in the css file about "license-ish" stuff
[15:47:29] <Barelds> which should probably be in all files
[15:47:59] <Barelds> but- if you read that- what license would you say is closest to that?
[15:48:29] <grafi> tricky questions :P
[15:49:08] <grafi> i think forjquery plugins its considered best practise to license them the same way jquery is licensed, so that you can actually use the plugin everywhere jquery can be used
[15:49:44] <Barelds> that sounds like a rather sensible option :p
[15:49:51] <grafi> but of course all that licensing stuff sucks even more than keeping docs up to date
[15:50:02] <grafi> :P
[15:50:27] <Barelds> haha
[15:50:49] <Barelds> you think there's CDN for bootstrap 3 yet?
[15:51:26] <Barelds> appears there is
[15:52:26] <grafi> haha
[15:52:35] <grafi> flatstrap
[15:52:40] <Barelds> ?
[15:53:54] <grafi> my first though was it looked very much like the new php docs ... but thats probably due to the color :P
[15:54:13] <Barelds> ah
[15:54:21] <Barelds> I like php documentation though
[15:54:37] <grafi> i didnt mind the old one
[15:54:44] <grafi> its okay though
[15:54:50] <grafi> once you get a little more used to it
[15:55:39] <grafi> The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a jQuery project.
[15:55:39] <grafi> You are free to use any jQuery project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact.
[15:55:51] <grafi> that would probably what you intended in your css
[15:56:14] <Barelds> aye
[15:57:41] <grafi> perfect :P
[16:00:10] <gehrc> Hey everyone -- big surprise, I'm having issues with IE 10!!
[16:00:41] <gehrc> I'm using the superfish plugin for my nav menus, and when someone goes to click on the child item that appears, the item disappears and doesn't follow the link.
[16:01:18] <gehrc> Sometimes after some fiddling, it'll work though, but it's very sporadic and I can't seem to figure out what I do that makes it decide to work suddenl.y
[16:02:04] <grafi> have some code for us to look at?
[16:02:24] <gehrc> Sure... let me grab the superfish script I've modified.
[16:03:40] <gehrc> http://pastebin.com/VBfpRUFH
[16:04:07] <santiissopasse> I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'Text' on line 18 of http://jsfiddle.net/RL38D/ could someone take a look and see if there's a glaring syntax error or something?
[16:04:41] <gehrc> And also I'm using supposition to detect items going off the page: http://pastebin.com/yfiG4MF9
[16:05:29] <shoky> `api text @ santiissopasse
[16:05:29] <b-ot> santiissopasse: .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[16:05:38] <grafi> Barelds as far as I can see theres nothing blarringly wrong with the plugin, the basic best practices you've ... practised :P not an expert though :P
[16:06:10] <Barelds> thanks :)
[16:06:31] <grafi> also it looks nice
[16:06:32] <grafi> :P
[16:06:36] <Barelds> id like to find a way to better separate what should be private / public
[16:07:13] <santiissopasse> b-ot: Yeah, I tried it with innerText() too but got the same error, I don't think its related to the method
[16:07:14] <Barelds> but im not sure how to do that without functions being created many times
[16:08:59] <Barelds> @grafi
[16:09:12] <Barelds> what about chainable
[16:09:16] <Barelds> and erm
[16:09:38] <shoky> santiissopasse: follow the docs. it's .text()  not .Text()
[16:10:14] <Barelds> being able to manipulate the current instance of the class by called $("#bla").TimerCircles() instead of it creating a new instance
[16:11:04] <grafi> have you looked at the jquery help pages for plugins then?
[16:11:33] <grafi> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[16:12:06] <Barelds> only at the basic one
[16:12:13] <Gazpacho> remember, "the docs" are not on w3schools
[16:12:14] <Barelds> and I already broke 1 of the conventions there :p
[16:12:16] <Gazpacho> they never are
[16:12:20] <shoky> Barelds: i like this one http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[16:12:48] <Barelds> since I didnt return this.each(function....
[16:13:24] <Dorfrod> how do you do HTML5 validation on a form that uses e.preventDefault()?
[16:13:24] <grafi> yeah i just realized :P
[16:13:37] <grafi> i thought you did though xP
[16:13:45] <grafi> must be getting tired :|
[16:15:53] <grafi> anywayd the basic/advanced pages will help you with that :P im off to bed :)
[16:16:04] <Barelds> good night
[16:16:05] <Barelds> and thanks
[16:17:02] <Barelds> I return an object, because I feel like that should be preferable. But Im not sure if thats the best way
[16:17:16] <Barelds> or if theres something im not seeing that would make the alternative better
[16:20:11] <santiissopasse> shoky, b-ot : you were right it was bc i was doing Text, not text. Still don't understand why innerHTML or innerText didn't work
[16:20:49] <shoky> santiissopasse: innerHTML and innerText are properties of DOM elements, not of jquery objects
[16:21:30] <santiissopasse> ok, that makes sense
[16:23:41] <hye> hi
[16:23:56] <hye> is there a jquery equivalent of jquery mobile's mobile.changepage?
[16:24:49] <shoky> that does what?
[16:25:10] <hye> the same thing... just gets an external page via ajax
[16:25:15] <hye> i think its .get if i am not mistaken
[16:31:21] <hye> nope didnt work
[16:31:26] <hye> .get and mobile.changepage not the same
[16:36:20] <scar> whats the best way to replicate the <marquee></marquee> html with js?
[16:36:35] <scar> i just want scrolling text, perhaps using ul/li for item containers? idk
[16:36:50] <Barelds> err
[16:36:56] <veQue> ahh
[16:36:58] <Barelds> why not marquee?
[16:37:33] <veQue> I've used marquee... once.
[16:37:51] <veQue> =) is bored and googling cool uses for jquery
[16:38:26] <Barelds> if you're feeling chatty, you mind giving me feedback on a plugin I wrote? first plugin ive written so Im looking for feedback
[16:39:41] <veQue> sure. do i have to dig through code?
[16:39:50] <veQue> or just try it out?
[16:40:01] <Barelds> if you'd like, otherwise just functional feedback is ok
[16:40:12] <Barelds> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/visual-timer-plugin-my-first-jquery-plugin-feedback-wanted
[16:42:13] <veQue> looks pretty, works in firefox, job well done.
[16:42:21] <Barelds> lol
[16:42:50] <veQue> Barelds: I'm seeing a bit of artifacts
[16:43:01] <veQue> don't really know why
[16:43:11] <Barelds> any chance you could get a screenshot?
[16:45:38] <Barelds> hmm the bootstrap 3 buttons are more flat than the 2.3 ones, not sure I like the flat
[16:45:45] <veQue> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=56414
[16:45:58] <veQue> the pink one
[16:46:24] <Barelds> hmm could be a rounding error
[16:46:36] <Barelds> i'll be a little more aggresive in clearRect()
[16:47:09] <veQue> looks cool. how long have you worked on it?
[16:47:15] <scar> Barelds, really use marquee??
[16:47:16] <scar> ;p;
[16:47:18] <scar> lol
[16:47:22] <scar> just apply some good css?
[16:47:34] <Barelds> 2 or 3 days, only 1 day with a decent time input
[16:48:11] <Barelds> scar; people are reluctant to use a lot of HTML elements because they're "in bad taste" or whatever. I say if there is an element that does precisely what you want, why not use it o_o
[16:48:22] <wad> Hi folks. I'm kinda stuck on my jquery UI code right now. I'm trying to make a button be disabled, but I get an exception when I include this line: $(".zButtonItemDumpDisabled").button("option", "disabled", true);
[16:48:47] <wad> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on button prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[16:48:49] <Barelds> err
[16:49:01] <scar> Barelds, how fancy can marquee be styled, even thru old versions im curious since it's a very old element
[16:49:15] <Barelds> $(".zButtonItemDumpDisabled").attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[16:49:32] <scar> or just attr('disabled', true) or false
[16:49:42] <zamba> hi there.. i want to implement a simple counter.. it should count up from a given time.. what should i use for this?
[16:50:01] <Barelds> ... I created that zamba
[16:50:04] <Barelds> today
[16:50:19] <zamba> Barelds: oh?
[16:50:29] <Barelds> unfortunately I have not yet written documentation, but its pretty simple- have a look at:
[16:50:35] <Barelds> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/visual-timer-plugin-my-first-jquery-plugin-feedback-wanted
[16:50:51] <Barelds> is that more or less what you're looking for?
[16:52:04] <zamba> more or less.. but i guess i want it much more simple.. this should be a clock timer for a sports match.. so i know when the game started.. and i basically want to start the timer from (now - whengamestarted)
[16:52:49] <Barelds> if you dont enter any paramters
[16:52:56] <Barelds> it counts from [now] upwards
[16:54:08] <Barelds> though if it needs to be simpler- you can not currently disable the circles :(
[16:54:11] <zamba> it looks like your code is overkill compared to my needs.. though it looks fine :)
[16:54:36] <Barelds> you can set it to update only once per second
[16:54:39] <zamba> exactly.. i don't need the circles.. i just need "Played: mm:ss" (where mm and ss are counting)
[16:54:43] <Barelds> which will dramatically reduce the overhead
[16:54:49] <Barelds> but yeah
[16:54:56] <scar> Barelds, how to change speed, etc of marquee? any way? prob #css ?
[16:55:46] <Barelds> I have no idea scar
[16:55:49] <scar> like on hover, stop it
[16:55:50] <scar> oh
[16:55:50] <scar> k
[16:56:02] <Barelds> if you want to have more control you could either go jquery or css
[16:56:21] <Barelds> jquery will give more flexibility
[16:58:28] <LindsayMac> a little happiness ??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=NMeuwYvlBI0  (only has mood enhancing effecrt with sound on) lol
[16:58:36] <LindsayMac> sorry.. I just felt this room needed a little uplifting
[16:59:06] <Barelds> o_o
[16:59:40] <LindsayMac> tell me that didnt make you smile?
[16:59:50] <wad> Barelds, scar, thanks that worked, sort of. I don't get an error, and the button is disabled, but it doesn't *look* disabled. The jQueryUI stuff to show a disabled button is somehow not invoked.
[17:00:23] <zamba> every implementation of this problem seems overengineered
[17:00:24] <Barelds> are you using bootstrap or anything alike?
[17:00:48] <wad> Barelds, I'm not sure what bootstraps is (sorry, I'm a js newb), but I am using requireJS.
[17:01:00] <Barelds> wad: google bootstrap
[17:01:03] <wad> ok
[17:01:39] <wad> Oh, I see. No, just using plain old jQueryUI. :)
[17:02:00] <Barelds> well, I dont think jquery would change the way a button looks
[17:02:06] <Barelds> from it being disabled
[17:02:13] <Barelds> other than browser default visual changes
[17:02:42] <Barelds> zamba: writing something quick for you
[17:03:45] <wad> Barelds, it does on other buttons in my app. The disabled buttons are darkened.
[17:03:54] <wad> I think it's a jQueryUI thing.
[17:04:38] <Barelds> wad: link?
[17:04:40] <zamba> Barelds: you are?
[17:04:53] <Barelds> yes
[17:04:53] <zamba> Barelds: i've just started out with the <span class="matchclock">00:00</span> ;)
[17:04:58] <Barelds> just give me a minute zamba
[17:05:02] <zamba> Barelds: sweet :)
[17:05:49] <wad> Barelds: Sure, go to zerbat.com. See how some of the buttons are disabled.
[17:06:13] <Barelds> wad: with jquery or without?
[17:06:28] <wad> Those are disabled with jqueryUI. Here's the code that does it:
[17:06:45] <Barelds> err, sorry I meant
[17:06:47] <Barelds> Zamba
[17:06:51] <Barelds> with or without jquery
[17:06:52] <wad>                 $buttonLoadGame.button("option", "disabled", false);
[17:07:13] <wad> It's on the button method, which invokes magical jQueryUI stuff. :)
[17:07:53] <wad> For some reason, when I try that same code on some other buttons (that are dyanamically added to the DOM), I get that funky exception.
[17:08:09] <zamba> Barelds: preferably with
[17:08:20] <wad> Like I'm trying to call the option method on something that hasn't been initialized yet.
[17:08:22] <zamba> Barelds: but maybe pure js is the best way to go..?
[17:08:40] <zamba> but i'm already using jquery, so
[17:09:28] <Barelds> see private message zamba
[17:10:06] <Barelds> @ wad
[17:10:09] <wad> ?
[17:10:21] <Barelds> try this
[17:10:25] * wad perks up
[17:10:28] <Barelds> $(".zButtonItemDumpDisabled").attr('disabled', 'disabled').addClass('disabled');
[17:10:40] * wad tries delightedly
[17:11:00] <Barelds> im only guessing that they use a class called disabled to trigger the disabled look
[17:11:40] <Barelds> ah change it to:
[17:11:45] <Barelds> $(".zButtonItemDumpDisabled").attr('disabled', 'disabled').addClass('ui-disabled');
[17:12:08] <wad> Barelds, that disables the button, but it's not styled at all.
[17:12:16] <wad> oh, hang on
[17:12:24] * wad must try the latest
[17:12:28] <Barelds> :p
[17:12:50] <wad> ah, same thing.
[17:12:55] <wad> No style on the button.
[17:13:00] <wad> I can push it, want to see the result?
[17:13:04] <Barelds> sure
[17:13:47] <wad> Okay, refresh zerbat.com (dispose of the js cache, of course). Click "new game", hit OK a couple of times, then go to the Inventory tab. You'll see it there.,
[17:14:06] <wad> Ah shoot.
[17:14:07] <wad> Hang on.
[17:14:37] <wad> okay, now try it.
[17:14:41] <Barelds> i dont see anything -O
[17:14:47] <wad> I missed a step. -_-
[17:14:55] <wad> It's there now, I think. Checking myself...
[17:15:26] <wad> Yep, it's there. Be sure to clear javascript cache.
[17:16:04] <Barelds> right
[17:16:28] <wad> :)
[17:16:59] <Barelds> you havent given it role="button"
[17:17:14] <wad> Ah....
[17:18:18] <Barelds> which is possible why the .button( think didnt work
[17:18:25] <wad> ah
[17:18:44] <wad> I'm not sure how to set roles. Lemme google it
[17:19:07] <Barelds> I manually added it
[17:19:08] <Barelds> then did
[17:19:15] <Barelds> $("#buttonItemDump_1").button();
[17:19:21] <Barelds> and now it looks good + disabled
[17:20:01] <wad> ah!
[17:20:09] * wad tries
[17:20:21] <Barelds> that was after manually adding the role="button"
[17:22:47] <wad> It works!
[17:22:53] <wad> Barelds, thanks a ton!
[17:23:00] <wad> By the way, what does "barelds" mean?
[17:23:56] <wad> I think I see how this is working. First, set the disabled attribute on it. Then call the JQueryUI button method on it.
[17:24:56] <Barelds> @wad: I dont think it means anything. Just my last name
[17:26:50] <wad> Cool. My last name is "Wadsworth". Hence "wad". :)
[17:27:06] <Barelds> ... of the wadsworth constant?
[17:29:28] <Barelds> yes/no?
[17:31:26] <wad> hmm?
[17:31:29] <wad> Wadsworth constant?
[17:31:31] * wad googles it
[17:31:48] <Barelds> .. someone with your name invented the Wadsworth constant
[17:31:53] <wad> AHAHAAAA! Never saw that before!
[17:32:08] <Barelds> it means that you can start any video  at 30% to skip to the relevant part
[17:32:11] <Barelds> youtube implemented it
[17:32:15] <Barelds> &wadsworth=1
[17:34:42] <wad> Thanks for sharing that with me.
[17:34:50] <Barelds> :D
[17:34:57] * soahccc was about to say the same
[17:35:04] <Barelds> I thought I was talking to internet celebrity for a moment :p
[17:39:54] <wad> Heh, yeah, I'm not much of a celeberity. :) Although I do have  a photo with me and the guy who invented Ruby! And I've met the guy who invented Java, too.
[17:40:22] <Barelds> nice
[17:41:08] <wad> Oh, and I created zerbat.com. Does that make me famous?
[17:41:35] <Barelds> Im not sure it does
[17:42:04] <Barelds> I begrudgingly admit I had not heard of it before
[17:42:21] <sammich> holy gradients
[17:42:41] <Barelds> lightish yellow to white?
[17:42:49] <Barelds> maybe some baby blue
[17:44:22] <veQue> wad: you are the zerbat creator?
[17:44:27] <veQue> oh man.
[17:44:37] * wad beats his chest and lets out a Tarzan yell
[17:44:39] <veQue> =)
[17:44:47] <wad> :-D
[17:44:54] * veQue decides to go check zerbat out
[17:45:30] <veQue> =)
[17:45:30] <wad> Prepare to be underwhelmed. It's just my "learn javascript" project.
[17:45:36] <wad> Very-much under construction.
[17:45:50] <veQue> well that sounds great
[17:46:01] <veQue> i got much to learn myself
[17:46:47] <wad> What's more fun to build than a game? :)
[17:46:50] <Barelds> personally;
[17:47:19] <Barelds> jquery is great, jquery mobile less so. I'd recommend getting into underscore or alike before jquery mobile
[17:47:39] <Barelds> also node.js can be interesting if you have a server to run it on
[17:48:48] <wad> I'm not doing anything mobile.
[17:49:03] <Barelds> if its purely for visual aid
[17:49:12] <Barelds> I would strongly recommend using bootstrap
[17:49:31] <Barelds> less invasive, more... stuff
[17:49:41] <sammich> the jquery ui look is so dated
[17:49:58] <sammich> how I hate the look of their widgets
[17:50:10] <Barelds> also jquery mobile is frankly too heavy for many actual mobile devices
[17:52:47] <wad> So bootstrap is the preferred way to go these days. Interesting.
[17:53:06] <wad> Well, I'm already going strong with jQueryUI, so I think I'll just keep with this for now. I can always change it later. :)
[17:54:05] <sammich> does bootstrap do animations or is it just a theme/widget factory?
[17:55:00] <Barelds> animations are minimal and mostly limited to widgets
[17:55:24] <Barelds> jquery + bootstrap is what I use mostly,. sometimes with underscore (mostly if I need .debounce)
[17:55:53] <sammich> I'm wondering if I can drop jQuery UI from my libraries
[17:57:58] <Barelds> I dunno, some jQuery UI things are still pretty nice
[17:58:09] <Barelds> I only really include it when Im using it though
[18:00:33] <sammich> color animation
[18:00:37] <sammich> not that I use it
[18:01:26] <sammich> anyone used https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit?
[18:01:50] <sammich> or https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced?
[18:03:17] <Barelds> not me
[18:04:11] <sammich> I got told at work the other day that we only need to support IE9+ :)
[18:04:23] <Barelds> nice :D
[18:04:24] <sammich> I think CSS3 animations are in there
[18:04:36] <Barelds> though frankly, IE8 and up arent so horrible
[18:04:40] <sammich> it's true
[18:04:47] <veQue> http://laughingsquid.com/how-to-scramble-hard-boiled-eggs-inside-their-uncracked-shell/ sorry unrelated to coding... but wow.
[18:04:58] <Barelds> having to be compatible with IE6 was the true hell :p
[18:05:00] <sammich> only thing we're missing is drag and drop support
[18:06:19] <sammich> sorry, but I hate egg whites
[18:06:35] <sammich> that just dilutes the yummy creamy yolk
[18:08:51] <veQue> still gotta admit, it's pretty cool
[18:10:32] <Barelds> anyone here familiar with bootstrap affix?
[18:12:34] <sammich> ooh, jquery mobile 1.4alpha
[18:12:42] <Barelds> o_o
[18:12:55] <sammich> they've gone...flat!
[18:13:16] <Barelds> :o
[18:13:18] <Barelds> link?
[18:13:29] <sammich> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-alpha.1/dist/demos/
[18:15:03] <Barelds> hmm looks better- though a bit... bulky still
[18:15:15] <sammich> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/07/25/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-4-0-alpha/#download
[18:15:28] <sammich> more CSS work, less manual selection
[18:16:09] <Barelds> pretty bad lightning storm here
[18:16:12] <Barelds> might have to go
[18:16:19] <Barelds> if it gets closer
[18:16:28] <sammich> since when does nature mean you have to stop using stuff
[18:16:47] <sammich> well
[18:17:17] <sammich> houses built here have to have surge protection built into the main line
[18:18:24] <Barelds> sure, but if its close enough risk of damage is still increased
[18:59:26] <Quest> In http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#snap-to If i drag a div to "snaptarget" div.    will the dragged div be shown INSIDE it as its child element in the dom?   i hit f12 on browser but showing contrary. is there a way to check and be sure?
[19:03:14] <sammich> draggable just means an element gets an absolute position and moved somewhere in the page, not the DOM
[19:03:31] <sammich> the snap-to is for logical placement for the user
[19:08:58] <Quest> sammich,  what if i need to change location in dom for its parent?
[19:09:16] <sammich> droppable?
[19:09:22] <Quest> sammich,  for elaboration i made a post for others to benefit too . http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17904314/drag-drop-and-change-parent-of-a-div-in-dom
[19:09:30] <Quest> sammich,  same happens with droppable
[19:10:32] <sammich> I think you need to use events
[19:10:40] <sammich> detach and append
[19:13:10] <Quest> sammich,  how would i get the div id to which the dagged div is being dragged to?
[19:14:10] <sammich> the handler will pass in an event and the dragged element
[19:14:22] <sammich> look under .drop(event)
[19:14:30] <Quest> sammich,   hm
[19:14:32] <Quest> ok
[19:14:56] <sammich> I've done this recently so it'll work
[19:17:16] <Quest> sammich,  can you show your code
[19:19:14] <sammich> drop: function(e, ui) { $(e.target).append($('#'+ui.draggable.id).detach()); }
[19:19:22] <sammich> off the top of my head
[19:19:47] <Quest> what do you mean by off the top of my head
[19:20:05] <sammich> e.target is the element being dropped on
[19:20:18] <sammich> ui.draggable is the element being dragged, then then dropped
[19:20:53] <sammich> it means I didn't copy it from somewhere, I wrote it from memory
[19:21:10] <Quest> isnt it the div with some id that is being dropped into some other div?
[19:21:42] <Quest> i want to catchup IDs later. of parent and of child(that was dragged and dropped)
[19:21:59] <Quest> sammich,  was i able to make it clear?
[19:22:43] <sammich> okay, let me make an example for you
[19:22:55] <Quest> ok!
[19:30:40] <Quest> sammich,  are you asad?
[19:30:49] <sammich> almost there
[19:31:29] <Quest> ok
[19:31:41] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/
[19:32:20] <sammich> that css() was to get rid of the relative positioning
[19:35:03] <Quest> parent divs (doppables) and one draggable that may enter either many times. how about to drop the dragme back to source?
[19:35:15] <Quest> sammich,  great clode by the way
[19:36:16] <Quest> sammich,  great code* by the way
[19:36:33] <sammich> thanks, I got that
[19:36:35] <sammich> :)
[19:37:08] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/1/
[19:40:01] <sonOfRa> Quest, for some more examples with drag/drop, with some constraints on the items, see my latest little project: http://jsfiddle.net/l33r0y/yrLbE/48/
[19:40:38] <Quest> sammich,  great
[19:40:42] <sonOfRa> code needs some overhaul, but most of the draggable stuff is pretty clear
[19:40:49] <sammich> ah, that's pretty cool
[19:41:32] <sammich> don't see border-radius on tds much
[19:41:59] <sammich> z-index on ui-draggable-helper should be set higher
[19:43:06] <sonOfRa> What exactly does that do? I don't quite understand what the "helper" is in the context of draggable
[19:43:30] <sammich> hmm, doesn't work anyway. I was just seeing that the draggable gets hidden behind the divs holding the text in the tds
[19:43:42] <sammich> but I know what's happening now
[19:44:08] <sammich> .ui-draggable-helper is the class given to the draggable element on start of drag
[19:44:50] <sammich> oh, sorry, helper is for sortable
[19:45:27] <sonOfRa> huh, why does it not happen when the C... elements are dragged?
[19:45:33] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/yrLbE/49/
[19:45:36] <sonOfRa> Only hidden behind the div when A.. are dragged
[19:46:12] <sonOfRa> cool, thanks
[19:47:09] <sammich> the first thing I did to get my current job was build this elaborate sortable/droppable widget
[19:47:54] <sammich> that was almost a year ago now, and that attempt was a mess now I look back at it
[19:48:16] <sonOfRa> this is my first jquery-thing ever really. I'm usually more on the server side with things
[19:48:25] <sammich> sortables are easier though, since they handle the 'moving' (remove append)
[19:49:06] <sonOfRa> I tried with sortable/grids at first, but that didn't lead to any good results
[19:50:15] <sammich> I've got a bunch of droppables connected to a slideout sortable
[19:50:18] <Quest> sonOfRa,  wow...
[19:51:41] <sammich> Quest: a simple alternative :) http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/2/
[19:51:54] <sammich> simpler*
[19:52:58] <sammich> sonOfRa: consider storing $(this) at the top of your functions
[19:53:23] <sammich> like var $el = $(this); every time you do $(this) it's actually building the jQuery element from the this object
[19:54:54] <Quest> sammich,  but thats sortable.
[19:54:56] <lhunath> I have an input in a li; and a click() handler on the li; whenever I click into the input, the li click handler triggers; how do I stop that?
[19:55:06] <sammich> Quest: it's an alternative
[19:55:25] <Quest> so its draggable and dropable and sortable . at the same time?
[19:55:37] <sammich> mostly
[19:55:49] <sammich> you have to configure it as such
[19:55:57] <sammich> with connectWith
[19:56:13] <Quest> sammich,  nice. I liked the green shadow appearing on sonOfRa 's fiddle when something is dragged to a cell
[19:56:30] <Quest> and yellow box still remains until its droped
[19:56:48] <Quest> sammich,  on nice. very nice sammich  . you made good use of it
[19:56:50] <sammich> yeah. those interaction widgets have stacks of events you can configure
[19:57:04] <Quest> sammich,  thanks!
[19:57:10] <sonOfRa> you can handle those with hoverClass, or if it's not fine-grained enough, with the over:/out: events
[19:57:10] <sammich> say for 'over()' you can add a class like 'overClass'
[19:57:12] <Quest> sonOfRa, thanks!
[19:57:23] <Quest> sammich,  oh
[19:58:29] <sammich> if you look at his fiddle JS at line 200
[20:03:18] <sonOfRa> anyways, if you have any questions regarding that, ask now, I'm gonna go sleep soon, since it's already 5am
[21:31:40] <avocado> i have this page http://pastebin.com/KYWpd2Cz and i have some problem that i don't understand. if i click any of the buttons twice in a row, the 2nd time i click a button, it basically freezes. what am i supposed to be doing?
[22:42:51] <paulvd> is there a jquery accorion ui plugin which does this http://www.dishpromotions.com/dishnet.asp
[22:43:09] <paulvd> sliding tabs
[22:49:20] <sammich> that's just a slider
[22:49:28] <sammich> so lookup 'sliders'
[23:02:30] <pjp> Hi, I'm making a $.post request using jquery-1.10.1; It's works in Chromium, but not in Firefox 22, has anyone faced this before?
[23:05:01] <ravenzz> ?demo
[23:05:01] <b-ot> ravenzz: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:05:41] * pjp clicks
[23:09:40] <pjp> ravenzz: how do I create a demo on jsfiddle.net ? I'm new to it, never used it before.
[23:09:58] <pjp> b-ot: ^
[23:10:24] <ravenzz> basically you paste your code on each panel (html, js, css)
[23:10:35] <ravenzz> just the one needed to reproduce the issue
[23:11:00] <ravenzz> then you  select jQuery from the Framework & Extensions panel on the left
[23:25:51] <pjp> ravenzz: I've the html and JS copied there -> http://jsfiddle.net/ZFKk9/
[23:26:24] <ravenzz> ok man, this is bad! action="javascript: add_feed();"
[23:26:39] <ravenzz> you should separate your html and js
[23:27:15] <pjp> ravenzz: Oh, I'm trying to do that, but not sure what is the best practice for that,
[23:27:25] <pjp> ravenzz: how do I go about it?
[23:27:49] <ravenzz> let me show you how
[23:27:54] <sammich> type="submit" action="post"? with a submit listener?
[23:28:09] <sammich> (i'm just guessing, I'm not made these forms in a long time)
[23:28:14] <sammich> I've*
[23:28:47] <pjp> sammich: but form will need some action to along with submit and post, no?
[23:29:06] <pjp> sammich: what is submit listener?
[23:29:13] <sammich> your action ;)
[23:29:22] <sammich> jquery event handler
[23:29:53] <sammich> wait for raven to get back
[23:30:27] <pjp> sammich: okay
[23:32:10] <ragsagar> Is it possible to do multiple suggestions in a textarea with typeahead.js ?
[23:34:43] <ravenzz> pjp http://jsfiddle.net/tyk39/
[23:34:50] * pjp clicks
[23:36:21] <ravenzz> pjp if js fails it will still work, because of the proper form action
[23:36:36] <pjp> ravenzz: I see,
[23:36:43] <sammich> ah, see, totally wrong
[23:36:52] <sammich> me, that is
[23:37:14] <pjp> ravenzz: Thanks so much, trying it on localhost.
[23:37:23] <ravenzz> yw
[23:37:45] <ravenzz> pjp local webserver?
[23:37:51] <pjp> ravenzz: yep
[23:37:56] <ravenzz> ah ok
[23:40:32] <pjp> ravenzz: I find JS & jQuery syntax and working pretty non-intuitive, how you wrote function ($) { $(function{ ...)) etc. is there a good tutorial to understand these things?
[23:41:38] <ravenzz> yes
[23:41:53] <pjp> ravenzz: is it function inside function and in the end (jQuery), which is a parameter ?
[23:42:03] <ravenzz> either the doc, or try this http://jqfundamentals.com/
[23:42:40] <pjp> ravenzz: I see, okay, I'll do that.
[23:42:42] <ravenzz> pjp $ is just an alias of the jQuery object
[23:42:56] <ravenzz> the outer function in javascript is called IIFE
[23:43:16] <pjp> ravenzz: IIFE?
[23:43:26] <ravenzz> which is the acronym for Immediately-invoked function expression
[23:43:40] <pjp> ravenzz: I see,
[23:44:04] <ravenzz> it is a function that it is declared and exectured immediately
[23:44:23] <pjp> ravenzz: immediately, as in?
[23:44:36] <pjp> ravenzz: on page load?
[23:44:48] <ravenzz> as soon as your js run
[23:45:49] <ravenzz> pjp do you know what a scope is in js?
[23:47:00] <pjp> ravenzz: nope, I'm quite an amateur web programmer
[23:47:09] <pjp> ravenzz: just starting,
[23:50:31] <ravenzz> long story short: in js you can declare stuff inside a function and those are available only within that function body or its inner functions
[23:50:53] <pjp> ravenzz: ah okay,
[23:52:07] <ravenzz> so usually people use to wrap their code with a IIFE so that their app specific functions, variables and the like won't be global
[23:52:33] <ravenzz> sorry my english is quite bad, so I suck at explaining thing properly
[23:53:32] <ravenzz> that's why you may want to use (function ($) { /* your stuff here */ }(jQuery));
[23:53:48] <ravenzz> function () {} <- this is a regular function
[23:53:54] <pjp> ravenzz: I see,
[23:54:00] <ravenzz> function () {}() <- this is an IIFE
[23:54:15] <pjp> ravenzz: right,
[23:54:43] <ravenzz> function (message) { console.log(message); }("hi there")
[23:56:29] <pjp> ravenzz: what is "hi there" ? message? you are defining a function and calling it at the same time?
[23:56:54] <ravenzz> yes, that is the same as this:
[23:57:12] <ravenzz> function myFunction(message) { console.log(message); }
[23:57:25] <ravenzz> myFunction("hi there");
[23:57:35] <ravenzz> well almost the same
[23:58:04] <ravenzz> you can try it on the chrome dev tools: function (message) { console.log(message); }("hi there")
[23:58:05] <pjp> ravenzz: Aha, hmmn, this second form is better, at least I can follow what is happening
[23:58:15] <pjp> ravenzz: yep,
[23:58:49] <ravenzz> well sometimes you don't need to define it. you just want it to be a wrapper (remember the scope thing)
[23:59:31] <ravenzz> so you create an anonymous fn which is an IIFE
