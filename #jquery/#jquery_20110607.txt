[00:00:05] <wkmanire> pr0?
[00:00:23] <ryrych> professional
[00:00:29] <wkmanire> ryrych: If it works it is good enough until it causes a problem.
[00:01:17] <wkmanire> I would only really be concerned if you planned on distributing your plugin by itself.
[00:01:46] <ryrych> wkmanire: why?
[00:02:14] <ryrych> it is not so bad :)
[00:02:21] <wkmanire> In that case you need to be careful not to cause collissions in .data in case other plugins are being attached to the same elements.
[00:03:20] <ryrych> wkmanire: I store all needed information in lightbox structure which is built once per page
[00:03:42] <ryrych> I donâ€™t worry about collision
[00:03:50] <wkmanire> Right, since your usage is specific to your application I`m sure its a perfect match.
[00:04:22] <ryrych> wkmanire: thanks, I am still learning and looking for best approaches :)
[00:07:11] <wkmanire> ryrych: Thats a healthy attitude. To be honest with you, I don't even know what professional means anymore. There are a lot of people who are way better developers than me making less money than me, and a lot of people who are way worse than me making more. :/ Web dev trends are coming and going so quickly anymore... and most of us cannot even begin to consider our applications in the same way giant tech company's like google do...
[00:07:28] <nevvermind1> quick question: can i insert values in some inputs *in another site*? cuz.. uhm... i don't think you can
[00:07:31] <wkmanire> ryrych: I would say, just make sure your code is reliable, tested and well documented.  Beyond that what else can you do?
[00:08:04] <wkmanire> nevermind1: What are you trying to do?
[00:08:26] <mcsilvio> hi all. question: can i lay my dom elements out explictly with javascript/jquery without using css?
[00:09:00] <nevvermind1> someone askd me this. i thought it was nonsense. but then i realised i didn't have strong arguments against him. that means i don't fully understand hhtp & co
[00:09:35] <ryrych> wkmanire: :) yeah, I try to do my best and document my code well
[00:09:43] <wkmanire> nevvermind1: Well, that is sort of vague...
[00:10:17] <wkmanire> mcsilvio: You want an absolute layout but without using .css() functions?
[00:10:23] <nevvermind1> can i use some curl-ish, jquery-ish magic to actually go to a site where i would find some inputs already populated?
[00:10:33] <mcsilvio> wkmanire: yes.
[00:11:12] <wkmanire> mcsilvio: You'll have to drop down to the native style member of each element you want to adjust. Not sure what the benefit of that would be though since jQuery does that cross-browser compliant for you.
[00:11:34] <wkmanire> nevvermind1: Yes, but not from the browser in most cases.
[00:12:12] <nevvermind1> that's the catch: i know you can *send* the form data, but to *view* it as a pre-populated webpage i don't think it's possible
[00:12:13] <wkmanire> nevvermind1: If you run chrome with --disable-web-security you can do cross-domain stuff, but you`d be better off just writing a python script, or running some javascript through node at that point.
[00:12:36] <mcsilvio> wkmanire: well to tell the truth, i have a layout that is both fixed and fluid. i was hoping that with javascript I could force an absolute rendering depending on the pane size. and then redraw the view with every resize.
[00:12:53] <mcsilvio> because the css looks too unclean
[00:14:09] <nevvermind1> ok, simple terms: say I feed the string "hello worlds" to X. That X then sends me to www.google.com with its main search input already populated with "hello worlds".
[00:14:24] <wkmanire> mcsilvio: I think I understand better now. Have you seen the $.css() method? You can say $("#myElement").css("position", "absolute").css("top", "10px").css("left","10px") and so on.
[00:14:35] <amid_hasan> do you guys know how I can get my horoscope daily using jquery/json from yahoo?
[00:14:47] <wkmanire> nevvermind1: Only if that site is running serverside code and you did a GET request.
[00:15:07] <wkmanire> serverside code that is expecting that, or perhaps client side javascript that will populate the form from the querysting.
[00:15:09] <wkmanire> etc...
[00:15:32] <nevvermind1> a, some sort of API on that site's part
[00:15:44] <wkmanire> But you cannot write client side code that will be in effect after the browser navigates.
[00:16:00] <nevvermind1> that's my thought, also
[00:16:07] <nevvermind1> thanks
[00:16:22] <wkmanire> amid_hasan: See if yahoo provides a JSONP service that grants access to their horoscope data.
[00:16:53] <amid_hasan> wkmanire: i doubt it, but could be wrong
[00:16:57] <wkmanire> if so, you can use jQuery.ajax and friend's to consume it. Other than that you'll have to $.GET the page contents and then string or DOM parse it.
[00:17:15] <wkmanire> $.get()*
[00:20:08] <wkmanire> Good night all.
[00:20:36] <mcsilvio> wks: thanks good night!
[00:20:37] <amid_hasan> night wkmanire
[00:22:00] <devinrolsen> wkmanire, got it!
[00:22:33] <iszak> coldhead, Y U NO TALK?
[00:22:37] <devinrolsen> .find() was causing the issue. $frame.contents().bind() works.

[00:27:03] <KingDosser> Hey Guys
[00:27:30] <KingDosser> I am trying to do an AJAX call but for some reason my code is sending a post and a get?
[00:27:52] <amid_hasan> KingDosser: in the url?
[00:28:02] <amid_hasan> you are seeing the key/value pairs in the url?
[00:28:19] <KingDosser> What url?
[00:28:40] <JKarsrud> your url
[00:28:58] <amid_hasan> exactly
[00:29:27] <amid_hasan> Post your code
[00:38:44] <FeileX> Good evening.... morning, and or afternoon.  :)
[00:39:00] <FeileX> Had a quick question if any of the gurus are online
[00:39:39] <Morkel> Does jquery have an insertInto() method? I found insertAfter and Before but how can i insert code into a dev?
[00:39:40] <Morkel> div
[00:40:49] <sacho> how would you imagine such a function working
[00:41:03] <styol> Morkel: $('#thediv').html('insert salsa here');
[00:42:05] <Morkel> styol: but this replaces the old content
[00:42:33] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/appendTo http://api.jquery.com/prependTo
[00:42:51] <Morkel> ajpiano: Thank tou
[00:43:19] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/prwpkuivczdugzg0e6peq amid_hasan
[00:43:42] <JKarsrud> FeileX: just ask bro ;)
[00:43:55] <JKarsrud> No need to see if any of the gurus are online
[00:44:03] <JKarsrud> tho ajpiano seems to be here at this hour
[00:44:14] <ajpiano> i'm going to sleep
[00:44:15] <ajpiano> :p
[00:45:14] <FeileX> Doh.
[00:45:26] <FeileX> forgot to ask.... its been a long night.... anyways...
[00:45:39] <JKarsrud> ajpiano: good for you! Have a good one :)
[00:45:54] <FeileX> Trying to work with Selectors
[00:45:59] <coldhead> hi KingDosser, iszak
[00:46:06] <KingDosser> Hey coldhead :)
[00:46:06] <coldhead> sorry, drunken stupour
[00:46:08] <KingDosser> Hows it going mate
[00:46:13] <iszak> coldhead, <3
[00:46:19] <coldhead> adequately
[00:46:23] <FeileX> code so far is :
[00:46:24] <FeileX>  onclick="trigger_box(this);"
[00:46:27] <JKarsrud> ugh
[00:46:30] <JKarsrud> :P
[00:46:32] <iszak> coldhead, how's the ruby going?
[00:46:37] <JKarsrud> inline event handlers :(
[00:46:41] <iszak> you should really wait until beer o'clock
[00:46:42] <coldhead> FeileX: don't ever use onclick again
[00:46:48] <JKarsrud> coldhead++
[00:46:49] <JKarsrud> :)
[00:46:56] <coldhead> use click() like a proper person
[00:46:58] <KingDosser> coldhead Can you tell me why in http://pastie.org/private/prwpkuivczdugzg0e6peq I get a post and a get sent?
[00:46:59] <JKarsrud> FeileX: make a jsfiddle on it? :)
[00:47:03] <JKarsrud> ?jsfiddle
[00:47:12] <FeileX> 		function trigger_box(element){
[00:47:12] <FeileX> 			var id =  jQuery(element).data('triggerId');
[00:47:13] <JKarsrud> where's bot-t?
[00:47:32] <JKarsrud> FeileX: paste your code somewhere
[00:47:35] <JKarsrud> not in here :)
[00:47:37] <coldhead> ruby is good, iszak, high hopes for a job with it soon
[00:47:40] <FeileX> mkay
[00:48:39] <iszak> coldhead, congrats!
[00:48:47] <coldhead> finger xed
[00:48:48] <FeileX> PasteBin ok for ya'll?  http://pastebin.com/YKcBMiCp
[00:49:19] <JKarsrud> FeileX: okay, and what is the problem?
[00:49:43] <FeileX> when I do that var id and var type are both undefinded
[00:49:52] <FeileX> according to chrome and IE8
[00:50:01] <coldhead> KingDosser: what i see here should just issue a POST, no GET
[00:50:11] <KingDosser> http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/
[00:50:18] <JKarsrud> yes, probably because you have dashes in your data attribute, and not in your code
[00:50:21] <FeileX> Doh....
[00:50:23] <coldhead> unless it's also submitting a form maybe?
[00:50:28] <coldhead> login?
[00:50:45] <KingDosser> one sec will just make you one
[00:50:46] <FeileX> i was workign with a dataset plugin... changing to .data() fixed it
[00:52:31] <KingDosser> coldhead: username: dev, pass: abc123
[00:53:26] <coldhead> sup NOTEBOOK
[00:55:57] <KingDosser> Any ideas coldhead ?
[00:56:34] <makinen> how can I check whether there are more elements before I call selector's next() method?
[00:57:12] <coldhead> KingDosser: i would guess it's trying to submit your form when you hit enter
[00:57:21] <KingDosser> but it wasnt before?
[00:57:23] <coldhead> although hmm, why would it do it via ajax
[00:59:06] <coldhead> KingDosser: maybe the requested page is sending back a new URL?
[00:59:22] <coldhead> it is
[00:59:30] <coldhead> your POST request is getting a 302
[01:00:02] <KingDosser> what does that mean?
[01:00:04] <coldhead> location:/mynt/add_task.php/ is in the response headers
[01:00:27] <coldhead> so jQuery is loading that slightly different URL for you when the POST is done
[01:00:34] <coldhead> and throwing it away, i guess
[01:00:47] <coldhead> maybe you have some / appending rule in your .htaccess?
[01:00:51] <KingDosser> how do i fix it?
[01:01:08] <coldhead> it depends what's happening on the server side
[01:01:18] <coldhead> if it's something in the .htaccess you should take it out
[01:01:30] <coldhead> and if you din't know what the fuck then try setting a 200 header with php's header()
[01:02:10] <KingDosser> Okay gtg cheers mate
[01:02:23] <coldhead> OR you could just have the ajax request go to add_task.php/ in the first place
[01:02:32] <coldhead> #quickfix
[01:09:34] <coldhead> i have moved from vodka to guinness

[01:10:04] <timing_> uhl
[01:11:56] <coldhead> my poor neighbours
[01:29:01] <sdio> seriously? didn't your father figure tell you never to mix vodka with piss?
[01:29:21] <sdio> very disappointed in you, coldhead.
[01:30:36] <coldhead> my father is dead
[01:31:13] <sdio> well, if he didn't give you basic "being a man" instructions, I'm not going to grieve very much.
[01:32:24] <coldhead> all he taught me about drinking was "if you need to drink secretly at work, a good place to hide your liquor is in the cistern of the toilet"
[01:32:54] <sdio> sound advice.
[01:33:07] <sdio> a true gem.
[01:33:29] <dr0id> lsthemes IS BACK coldhead
[01:33:36] <coldhead> WHAT THE FUCK
[01:34:24] <Roy__> hi
[01:34:38] <sdio> who the hell is lsthemes!
[01:34:49] <coldhead> thx dr0id
[01:34:59] <dr0id> cool, and that wasn't a good advice :P
[01:35:18] <sdio> dr0id: it was. be quiet, child.
[01:35:29] <dr0id> ...
[01:35:32] <dr0id> uggh @ cistern
[01:35:40] <Roy__> need some help in jQgrid
[01:35:47] <Roy__> can u help ??????
[01:36:41] <coldhead> can you be more specific, Roy__ ?
[01:37:08] <Roy__> i m using inline editing facility in jqGrid.
[01:37:26] <Roy__> well i m working in asp.net with jQuery
[01:37:37] <Roy__> i have updated cell values in jqGrid
[01:38:08] <Roy__> but when i click on sort it s been lost
[01:38:13] <Roy__> i mean the edited values
[01:38:33] <Roy__> it is again fetching the original data from json
[01:39:24] <coldhead> can you paste your code on jsfiddle or somesuch?
[01:40:06] <larsemil> so i have several tables on a page, below each table i have a "export to excel" link. When i click, it sends with ajax the table content to excel.php. How would i go around to have the excel.php actually return a file to download when using ajax?
[01:40:41] <MACscr> what validation plugins are you guys using? i cant seem to figure out how to control where the errors appear next to the fields when using jquery.validate.min.js
[01:41:06] <coldhead> MACscr: you should be able to contrl it with CSS
[01:41:23] <coldhead> it's quite configurable anywya
[01:41:37] <coldhead> larsemil: i'm not sure that can be done
[01:42:25] <larsemil> okay. so if not using ajax, there has to be a method to "go2url" instead?
[01:42:44] <coldhead> larsemil: window.location = 'whatever.xls';
[01:43:04] <Roy__> http://jsfiddle.net/5h68Z/  fsfidlle link
[01:43:13] <coldhead> thx ro
[01:43:25] <coldhead> roy*
[01:44:28] <Roy__> yes
[01:46:40] <_ramo> hello
[01:46:49] <Roy__> hi
[01:47:06] <coldhead> did you look at this, Roy__ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2109754/jqgrid-reload-grid-after-successfull-inline-update-inline-creation-of-record ?
[01:47:09] <coldhead> it seems to be related
[01:47:17] <coldhead> i am not a jQgrid user, sorry
[01:47:57] <larsemil> coldhead: perfect! thanks. now i have sortable tables in the brower and can export them to excel with a click.
[01:48:10] <_ramo> i try to fetch a parameeter from the url like this on ready: var objectid = jQuery.getUrlVar('eprs[r]');	if(objectid == 'undefined' || objectid.length == 0) { but in firebug i always get the message, that objectid is not defined
[01:48:14] <rump> .
[01:48:17] <_ramo> does anyone know what i'm doing wrong here?
[01:48:32] <coldhead> good job, larsemil!
[01:49:09] <Luuxx> hi
[01:50:09] <MACscr> coldhead: hmm, how about instead of messages for the validation, it simply highlights the field?
[01:50:36] <coldhead> MACscr: it should add an "error" class already, for you to style
[01:50:50] <coldhead> an i think you can tell it another class to add instead if you prefer
[01:51:23] <MACscr> coldhead: crap, you are correct. Me need sleepy =P
[01:51:40] <coldhead> I HAVE TO EAT AND REST GOOD DAY
[01:51:56] <koichirose> Hello. The change() method on a form is not fired if I set a checkbox value with .attr(). is this by design? here's some code: http://pastie.org/2031418
[01:52:10] <Roy__> i tried but it is not working in my case can u go through the code which i have send
[01:52:34] <tehopeologist> can anyone explain to me why my slider's about 915 pixels to the right when it shouldn't be?  http://www.xecorporation.net/newvision
[01:52:46] <tehopeologist> the bgimages should be autocentered
[01:53:00] <tehopeologist> but i think the bxslider plugin's messing something up
[01:56:38] <Roy__> thank you for your precious time dear.......
[01:56:50] <Roy__> anyway help me if you get any more thread on the same
[01:57:03] <coldhead> koichirose: that is by design
[01:57:21] <coldhead> you can trigger change manually with trigger when you update the attr, if you need to
[01:57:40] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[02:04:29] <mduerksen> i'm sure this has been asked before, but google doesnt tell my anything: i need 'prevUntil', but *inclusive*, how would i do that? i'm aware of the '+ *' trick in 'nextUntil', but that won't help me with 'prevUntil'
[02:04:33] <koichirose> coldhead: thanks, I'll look it up
[02:06:32] <_ramo> how can i pass a value to a next page?
[02:11:16] <koichirose> coldhead: I don't understand why, in this case, trigger('submit') is different from .submit()
[02:17:41] <Rahly> because trigger doesn't do real event calling
[02:18:36] <Rahly> for example, all custom events never get called with trigger
[02:19:40] <ryrych> how can I destroy() on particualar wrapped element? is it $foo.plugin("destroy")?
[02:20:42] <Rahly> depends on the plugin... most plugins do not provide a way to undo their changes
[02:22:37] <ryrych> Rahly: is it to me? :)
[02:23:58] <koichirose> Rahly: ok, but what's the difference here?
[02:24:57] <merlin1978> I have 50 HTML Select and have the same options, is there a way to attach the options to all HTML Select with just specifying the id or class?  I have tried some code but it only attached the option to the first HTML Select it finds and did not attach the options to all HTML Select with the same ID
[02:25:33] <Woet> merlin1978: class="dropdown" - $(".dropdown")
[02:26:30] <Rahly> not sure what here is
[02:27:02] <merlin1978> Woet: I have tried using Class also but did not work for me
[02:27:22] <denyerec> hey chaps, having a hard time googling for this one, but what does $$ represent in jQuery?
[02:27:31] <denyerec> Obviously $('.something'); is a normal selector
[02:27:39] <denyerec> But Google REALLY doesn't like searching for $$ :)
[02:27:46] <denyerec> (Heck, I even tried bing!)
[02:28:18] <Rahly> jQuery('.something') ?
[02:28:43] <denyerec> isn't that the same as $('.something');
[02:28:45] <merlin1978> This is what I did http://pastebin.com/t22zFU68
[02:28:53] <Rahly> yes but is google searchable
[02:29:12] <denyerec> Hmmm.
[02:29:17] <Woet> denyerec: i just searched for "jquery dollardollar"
[02:29:19] <Woet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1463867/javascript-double-dollar-sign
[02:29:29] <denyerec> Ok woet
[02:29:34] <Rahly> lol
[02:29:35] <denyerec> I'm off to abuse my co-worker right now
[02:29:37] <Woet> or, denyerec: http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Development-Scripts-js/HTML-Tools/DOM-Builder-67291.html
[02:29:42] <Woet> This jQuery plugin defines the double-dollar ($$) function which can be used to create DOM
[02:29:46] <denyerec> That'll do me, thankyou most kindly!
[02:29:50] <Rahly> wouldn't have it been easier to use a $('select').each() ?
[02:29:50] <Woet> you're welcome
[02:30:28] <merlin1978> Woet: What do you think of the code http://pastebin.com/t22zFU68
[02:30:45] <Woet> merlin1978: where is the html? where are the classes?
[02:31:47] <merlin1978> Woet: The HTML part is just a plain HTML Select with the corresponding ID
[02:32:04] <Woet> merlin1978: okay, where are the classes then? what are you trying to do? what isn't working?
[02:32:35] <denyerec> Dang. I'm still confused.  $ == $$ ?
[02:32:53] <Rahly> $$ is just another variable name, it could mean ANYTHING
[02:32:56] <denyerec> Right.
[02:33:02] <Roy__> want to edit cell value and sort it again. But it is againt fetching old data. how to save the edited values in client side before i acutally update to database. using inline edit
[02:33:03] <Rahly> i could be a function, it could be a value
[02:33:04] <denyerec> And the DOM plugin seems to use it.
[02:33:05] <Roy__> anybody please
[02:33:13] <denyerec> To "create dom!"
[02:33:20] <Rahly> thats up to plugin then
[02:33:27] <denyerec> Alright, makes sense. I'll have him inspect it and see what plugin is defining it.
[02:33:30] <merlin1978> Woet: I am looking for a way to simply this because I have many HTML Select to fill up and I have to make this code addOptionsToCombo($('#selectMenuKeys19'),optionArray);  for every HTML Select
[02:33:32] <denyerec> Thanks muchly :)
[02:33:37] <Rahly> rtfm?
[02:34:04] <merlin1978> Woet: sorry I meant simplify
[02:46:57] <DragoneneWork> oO wait what
[02:47:06] <DragoneneWork> was that denyerec right there
[02:47:24] <DragoneneWork> I used to be on the same IRC channel as him a million years ago, roughly
[02:50:41] <ryrych> OK, Iâ€™ve taken the code from the widget factory
[02:54:40] <js[fn]> I have a jQuery plugin that accesses a RESTful API and returns deferred.promise() however I'd like to know if it's possible to modify data that comes from the API prior returning.  I've had a brief nose about within the promise but the location of the actual data isn't obvious
[02:55:31] <mekwall> js[fn]: preFilter perhaps?
[02:55:38] <mekwall> ajaxPrefilter even
[02:55:39] <mekwall> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[02:57:24] <js[fn]> mekwall: cheers, I'll take a look at that
[02:57:49] <mekwall> js[fn]: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Converters <-- that's more what you are looking for
[02:58:02] <mekwall> prefilter is called before the request :p

[03:15:01] <gf3> you don't have to, rosieres
[03:15:24] <gf3> rosieres: but if you don't, then jQuery has to lookup the element every time, which is slow

[03:36:47] <toxz> i have a json result with the key 'return'. if i do result.return i get an error in ie6....  - any ideas how to access this key?
[03:37:18] <markj> toxz https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words
[03:37:23] <markj> dont use it :)
[03:37:57] <toxz> markj - maybe theres a way like result.get('return')   :-9
[03:38:32] <markj> its a reserved keyword so you shouldnt be using it for anything but what its purpose is
[03:38:39] <markj> do you not have control over the json?
[03:39:56] <toxz> markj - ah i think i can do result['return']
[03:40:11] <dragoonis> ?eval jQuery.inArray(81, [81, 90, 05])
[03:40:18] <dragoonis> how to test this ? :)
[03:41:49] <markj> you might be able to toxz but i would really recommend against it
[03:42:21] <xec> dragoonis: you can use console in chrome, safari or firebug
[03:42:30] <toxz> markj - me too - but the "backend guy" says - no we cant change this now anymore
[03:42:48] <xec> dragoonis: it should return 0 - same as: [81, 90, 05].indexOf(81)
[03:43:03] <dragoonis> ah right
[03:43:06] <dragoonis> if() would fail
[03:43:21] <markj> i'd recommend a new job if your backend guys are retards :]
[03:43:29] <toxz> markj - in chrome theres no problem to do result.return - ie6 produces an error
[03:43:44] <xec> dragoonis: you get -1 if its not matched
[03:43:52] <dragoonis> xec: so if(inArray) !== -1)
[03:43:52] <dragoonis> ye
[03:43:54] <dragoonis> ?
[03:43:58] <markj> as its reserved there is no guarantee that will work in all browsers / future browsers
[03:44:01] <xec> dragoonis: that should work, yes
[03:44:21] <xec> dragoonis: apart from "inArray)" ?
[03:44:33] <dragoonis> obviously
[03:44:50] <dragoonis> hmm, check this
[03:44:51] <dragoonis> console.log($.inArray(81, ["81", "73", "33", "1"]))
[03:45:03] <dragoonis> i get -1
[03:45:11] <dragoonis> is it because it's a string and i'm matching integer ?
[03:45:13] <xec> yes, youre checking integer vs string
[03:45:16] <dragoonis> meh
[03:45:20] <dragoonis> parseInt() then ?
[03:45:39] <xec> cant you just do $.inArray("81", ["81", "73", "33", "1"])
[03:45:46] <dragoonis> naw
[03:45:51] <xec> why
[03:46:32] <dragoonis> xec, aye i just converted the first param to a string to match
[03:48:45] <xec> =)
[03:49:06] <dragoonis> xec, cheers!
[03:49:51] <xec> btw, if you type in oneliners in the console, you shouldnt need to wrap it in console.log()
[03:49:59] <dragoonis> I know
[03:50:08] <dragoonis> I was getting random output on my console so i  came here
[03:50:15] <dragoonis> but i used jsfiddle to fix the issue
[03:50:22] <xec> oh ok :)

[04:07:17] <Narcissus> you will need to rebind iirc rosieres
[04:07:41] <rosieres> iirc ?
[04:07:43] <xec> rosieres: or use .live('mouseenter',...)
[04:07:54] <xec> iirc = if i remember correctly

[04:43:12] <rns> *why the post data doesn't change
[04:44:49] <ablomen> rns, you are always submitting the first form, not the current form
[04:45:29] <rns> ablomen, how do I update it to submit from the current form?

[04:47:28] <Bongs> hi, how can i make normal  http request with delete method in jquery?

[04:47:44] <rosieres> ;-)
[04:48:30] <xec> rosieres: read up on what .live() does here: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:49:03] <gonchs> hi..I'm a jquery/js newbie .. does anyone have a time to help me with a simple question? I want to insert new <img> tag here - http://pastie.org/private/wljvirzr0pjuvmfjcihqw and don't know which method of those http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/  should I use to do so...
[04:49:42] <ablomen> gonchs, append
[04:50:08] <rns> ablomen, that seems to work for the first form, but not the second
[04:51:09] <gonchs> ablomen: nice...easy enough, thanks :)
[04:51:31] <xec> rosieres: basically, .live() binds to root of document and checks whenever you mouseover something, if the css rule "#test.show" matches
[04:51:34] <ablomen> rns, well you disable the send button without re-enabling it
[04:51:52] <ablomen> oh wait your not, nvm
[04:52:19] <rns> ablomen, would it have something to do with having 2 submit buttons on the second form? http://jsfiddle.net/R4GrE/3/
[04:53:08] <ablomen> rns, i see only one form... paste your html too
[04:53:15] <Trisox> BUuuuRrrPPppppppp
[04:53:19] <Trisox> ^^
[04:53:26] <rns> ablomen, http://jsfiddle.net/R4GrE/4/
[04:54:57] <ablomen> rns, well for one your html is not valid, for example you have multiple elements with the id senbutton, while every id has to be unique on the page, first make sure your page is valid
[04:55:11] <ablomen> since afaik the code should work on a valid page
[04:56:39] <rns> ablomen, how do I get the js to recognize all of the send button id's then if they all have different names?
[04:57:04] <ablomen> rns, use classes
[04:58:33] <rns> ablomen, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/R4GrE/5/
[04:58:53] <ablomen> rns, well you have to change the html too..
[04:59:31] <rns> ablomen, forgot to paste that in, but it is changed.  It still is not working though.. http://jsfiddle.net/R4GrE/6/
[05:00:58] <ablomen> rns, like i said, make sure the html is valid, with only this snippet i can't see what else is wrong
[05:01:31] <ablomen> also, you don't have form actions defined
[05:02:17] <ablomen> or the proforma_table element, so there's not much i can do with this example
[05:09:18] <Klevre> I want to make a div move along with the scroll bar, how do I do that?

[05:20:51] <Skola> presses what button?
[05:20:53] <Skola> keyboard or mouse?
[05:21:01] <vidarw> a click event
[05:21:47] <Skola> click anywhere or?
[05:21:52] <vidarw> so basically i just need help with the code that changes the selected value in the <selection> <option> element
[05:21:59] <Skola> ah right
[05:22:05] <mtcwilliam> when they click a form button?
[05:22:10] <Skola> does val() not work?
[05:22:13] <Skola> for this?
[05:22:15] <xec> vidarw: you can do .val() on the select element iirc
[05:22:39] <Skola> $('option').val('whatever')
[05:22:46] <Trisox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKm5xQyD2vE&NR=1

[05:25:34] <Bongs> is there any way to make normal http call in jquery
[05:25:47] <mtcwilliam> as in ajax call?
[05:25:50] <Bongs> no
[05:26:01] <Bongs> withour using .post/.get/.ajax
[05:26:23] <Klevre> seutje: Then it'd stay in the same place no matter how much I scroll
[05:26:32] <ablomen> Bongs, you want to change the page?
[05:26:37] <Bongs> yes
[05:26:41] <mtcwilliam> window.location?
[05:26:45] <ablomen> window.location = "google.com"
[05:26:48] <Klevre> I want to calculate where the slider of the scrollbar is and position the div right next to slider position
[05:27:38] <Bongs> the scene is, I am poping out a delete confirmation box using jQuery UI dialog... on clicking delete button it should make normal http request with method = delete
[05:28:14] <seutje> Klevre: heh, good luck!
[05:28:24] <Klevre> seutje: It's not possible?
[05:28:36] <seutje> Klevre: did I say that?
[05:28:54] <Klevre> nvm
[05:31:40] <mtcwilliam> bongs: cant you just return false to stop it doing?
[05:32:24] <Bongs> :( no
[05:33:27] <cerzi> is it possible to nest some kind of image carousel inside a jqueryUI modal dialog? how easy would it be to modify an image carousel plugin to allow the user to make a selection, which closes the modal and shows the selected image on the original page?
[05:33:51] <Bongs> I just want the ruby-on-rails delete confirmation appear like jQuery UI dialog, but the delete should work like normal delete function
[05:35:56] <jomofcw> cerzi it is possible yea, but should not be so easy that you expect. You just have to open the modal with the HTML of the caroussel, then apply the carroussel to the HTML, then bind some action on some element.
[05:37:08] <cerzi> jomofcw: thanks - I guess there isn't already a plugin that does this somewhere out there already? ;_; am kinda new to all this!
[05:37:37] <jomofcw> cerzi it should not exists, sorry. Because it's too specific.
[05:38:19] <cerzi> jomofcw: i was quite surprised i couldn't find anything, as what im after is basically some kind of modal image selector. but yes it is relatively specific
[05:39:41] <jomofcw> Yep, you could easily find modal script (as the jQuery UI one), and acroussel script. But the 2-in-1 I think nop.
[05:39:59] <cerzi> aw ok - well thanks for the help :)
[05:40:06] <RyanD> I could build one :D.
[05:40:13] <Jagan_> I have a problem with Jquery validator plugin. If user checks a radio button, I have to apply three validations for a text field. one its mandatory, two it is numeric and three its min length shud be 5. I am using some thing as following, but its not working. If radio is checked, mandatory validation is applied, and if radio is not checked other validations are applied. I want to apply all validations only if radio is checked.  If ra
[05:40:28] <RyanD> But from a UI standpoint it already sounds clunky, albeit not knowing specific function.
[05:40:36] <cerzi> RyanD: do you reckon itd be easier to build from scratch than to combine plugins?
[05:40:38] <Jagan_> : { 		"required":"#myRadio:checked", 		"minlength":5, 		"number": true 		} 	}
[05:40:56] <RyanD> Use existing jq ui modal code + build carousel inside?
[05:42:01] <cerzi> RyanD: the full thing is basically 2+ empty picture frames sitting in the body of the html, of fixed width/height... when a user clicks an empty frame, a modal image viewer-type thingy pops up, and when the user clicks an image (or an icon) that image pops into the empty frame as a thumbnail
[05:42:34] <cerzi> so basically its an image selector that displays a thumbnail of the chosen image on the original page
[05:43:02] <RyanD> Yeah. I'd do as I said then.
[05:43:04] <johanhar> Hi. Where can I find a list of methods, that I can do on the DOM element P? I have selected it with $("#p") ...
[05:43:20] <RyanD> http://jqapi.com/
[05:43:22] <johanhar> I want to add a child node of text inside the paragraph

[05:43:38] <RyanD> .html...
[05:43:45] <mekwall> js[fn]: np, happy I could help
[05:43:51] <johanhar> RyanD: thanks
[05:44:01] <cerzi> RyanD: one of the hurdles ive had is making a carousel plugin interactable, most of them seem to be purely for illustrative purposes
[05:44:12] <RyanD> cerzi: explain?
[05:44:31] <RyanD> I may disappear out of nowhere, FWIW. Once another dev gets in here I've got a mess of CMS work to do.
[05:44:54] <cerzi> as in, being able to add an icon that onclick'd closes the modal *and* returns the image as a thumbnail
[05:45:29] <cerzi> or if i was a jquery master i would also allow the image to be cropped whilst inside the modal, and the cropped image returned as a thumbnail.. but ill leave that bit out for now hehe
[05:45:50] <cerzi> it could be there is just a much simpler way to do this that ive missed
[05:45:55] <RyanD> ok, bind a click event to the icon that triggers a close of the modal, and writes .attr src for the thumb?
[05:46:38] <cerzi> ok- so it sounds like its possible - need to go fill myself in on some syntax stuff though :)

[05:46:50] <laerti> Hello im using a cufon font but my jquery menu submenu items goes to back of the cufon ,  please any suggestion
[05:46:56] <cerzi> the other option would be just to chicken out and simply use a dropdown box with URLs or labels instead of images
[05:46:58] <RyanD> http://jqapi.com/#p=attr
[05:47:09] <RyanD> to change img src of the main body image.
[05:47:13] <cerzi> but if possible id really like to do it the graphical way
[05:47:19] <cerzi> cool, thanks for the help :)
[05:47:39] <RyanD> No, this isn't too hard at all.
[05:47:55] <RyanD> One function w/two lines of code to get what you just described.
[05:48:18] <RyanD> If this isn't something you need done today (Like I said, I'm going to go MIA at some point this morning)
[05:48:22] <cerzi> great :D and that includes the jquery ui dialog plugin and carousel?
[05:48:28] <RyanD> oh.
[05:48:30] <RyanD> No, lol.
[05:48:36] <cerzi> i mean, it doesnt have to
[05:48:38] <RyanD> Use JQ UI to build your modal.
[05:48:41] <cerzi> if theres a better way
[05:48:50] <RyanD> THEN inside of that, build a carousel (recommend fixed-width for the modal)
[05:49:32] <dwarder> helo, i'm using 1.5 which version of http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.7/jquery.validate.min.js should i use?

[05:49:48] <RyanD> dwarder: update.

[05:55:54] <mogaj> do i have to download anyother file other than jquery to get accordion to work ???
[05:56:22] <laerti> RyanD  please take a look now
[05:56:34] <RyanD> dwarder: For your purposes, surely.
[05:56:46] <RyanD> laerti: mtcwilliams read it.
[05:57:37] <laerti> thankkk  youuuuu it works
[05:57:43] <laerti> i had 3 hours on that
[05:57:43] <seutje> mtcwilliam: 1 is plenty
[05:58:08] <mtcwilliam> :)
[05:58:14] <mtcwilliam> just wanted to make sure
[05:58:55] <dwarder> RyanD: thank you
[05:59:19] <RyanD> Don't hold me to it, but I haven't come across any issues myself, I'm unsure if there are core team members on here o rnot.
[05:59:21] <RyanD> *or not.
[06:06:47] <Klevre> seutje: Can't figure it out
[06:06:52] <Klevre> any ideas?
[06:07:53] <mtcwilliam> Klevre: What's up?
[06:08:08] <Klevre> I'm trying to get slider position of the scrollbar
[06:08:21] <Klevre> and display a div right next to it
[06:12:25] <rns> anyone know why this works in chrome but not firefox (page still reloads)?  http://jsfiddle.net/R4GrE/6/
[06:15:27] <HannesP> the return value of $("<td>") is a reference to the newly created TD element, an nothing else, right?
[06:20:37] <chachan> guys, is there a way to know when a tab becomes inactive and when becomes active?
[06:21:08] <AdvoWork> hi, im doing this: http://pastebin.com/iMTPMSmp to style my table, but im appending a row, and other tds etc, but they arent styled like my tables are. Any ideas please?
[06:47:28] <Rahly> i wish jquery triggered custom events
[06:50:36] <mattp_> hey guys, i want to submit some custom data with ajaxForm
[06:50:52] <mattp_> it lets you pass a data: object, but i want to pass data on the fly
[06:51:07] <mattp_> ie at the time of submission, not when i bind the form at document ready
[06:52:08] <rosieres> can somebody help me to get the parent node and replace smth ? http://jsfiddle.net/CGf6g/1/
[06:59:14] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: what's your exact goal?
[07:01:57] <rosieres> dxgriffiths: I have to put my content into a new window because of printing purposes ..... If you press print - the id="h1" should be printed also . . . afaik this is not possible with jquery - thatÂ´s why this approach . . .
[07:04:24] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: Ok, looking.
[07:06:38] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: Ok, so what type of object is myone.
[07:07:24] <rosieres> myone is a div container
[07:07:58] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: How about after this line though? var myone = this.parentNode.id.replace('s', 'h');
[07:08:11] <dxgriffiths> What object type is that going to generate.
[07:08:29] <killfill> hi
[07:09:13] <diamonds> Hi friends
[07:09:15] <rosieres> dxgriffiths: originally i wanted to clone the id="h1" with this . . .  but for some reasons it doesntÂ´ work
[07:09:16] <Klevre> seutje: var $scrollPos = $(window).scrollTop() + (($(window).scrollTop() / $(document).height() * 100) / 100 * $(window).height());
[07:09:25] <diamonds> I can't figure out why why my object is being treated as a string: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Sh4MHXYZ
[07:09:45] <diamonds> how can I... make it an object?
[07:09:46] <seutje> Klevre: why u telling me? wanna show off how often u can repeat a selector for no reason at all?
[07:10:00] <diamonds> maybe this is a javascript question...
[07:10:45] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: So what do you want to do with the id, just print it out?
[07:11:22] <Klevre> seutje: No, wanted to show the solution I came up with and see if there could be any improvements made
[07:11:59] <rosieres> dxgriffiths: as you can see I want to do the same like with popp
[07:12:54] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: Ok, so what's printing out now... undefined, right? So the question is, what kind of object is myone and why is myone.innerHTML printing out as undefined.
[07:13:00] <Klevre> seutje: What do you mean by repeating a selector for no reason?
[07:13:21] <diamonds> perhaps I have the wrong response content-type header (?)
[07:13:53] <dxgriffiths> diamonds: which line are we looking at?
[07:14:15] <diamonds> dxgriffiths: mostly 19 & 30
[07:14:26] <diamonds> I tried to provide plenty of context
[07:14:40] <diamonds> I'm trying to get line 23 or 25 to work
[07:15:25] <seutje> Klevre: make it fixed and remove the first "$(window).scrollTop() +", much smoother imo
[07:15:52] <rosieres> dxgriffiths: thatÂ´s why IÂ´m asking here. . . . I just want to get the parents node ID and replace a part of it, clone it and then print it . . .
[07:15:52] <seutje> Klevre: $(window); $(window); is needless repetition
[07:16:42] <diamonds> this seems like a similar issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/249692/jquery-wont-parse-my-json-from-ajax-query
[07:17:34] <diamonds> dxgriffiths: ##javascript says json.parse
[07:17:47] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: Right. So I'm helping you figure it out :) What kind of object does replace() return? Tip: it's not an HTML element.
[07:18:47] <dxgriffiths> diamonds: Did you notice in the stackoverflow example that dataType is set to 'json'?
[07:18:53] <ryanneufeld> rosieres: get the element, clone it, then change the id.
[07:19:07] <diamonds> dxgriffiths: ahhh.... you are correct!
[07:19:17] <diamonds> that does the parsing for you, presumably?
[07:19:49] <dxgriffiths> diamonds: it's supposed to. If you continue having a problem after that, then the responses to his question may help.
[07:26:11] <Stefunel> guys, how do I add a function to a radio button on click?
[07:26:37] <dxgriffiths> Stefunel: what have you tried already?
[07:31:47] <merrick> I have CSS filters that use checkboxes to hide elements in the search results.  Whenever a user clicks any checkbox, all the checkboxes are serailized and stored in a cookie.  When the user returns to the results page however, the correct check boxes are still checked, but all the search results are visible again.  Any ideas anyone?
[07:34:15] <dxgriffiths> merrick: is the code to restyle the results you want hidden being re-run at the right time?
[07:35:53] <merrick> yes.  when the user returns to the search results page, i use php to check the coookie and then depending on the cookie value 'checked=yes' is printed on the input element.  Ex.  $filterValues['radio'] == "asc") ? "checked='yes'" : '';
[07:36:20] <merrick> and $fitlerValues is set like this:
[07:36:20] <merrick> parse_str($_COOKIE['filters'], $filterValues);
[07:37:58] <rosieres> dxgriffiths: took a time  . ..  but I understand && thank you !! http://jsfiddle.net/CGf6g/4/
[07:38:19] <dxgriffiths> rosieres: Awesome! You're welcome.
[07:39:01] <[THC]AcidRain> if anyone has any computer informative articles they would like to donate to my website. plz msg me.
[07:39:20] <dxgriffiths> merrick: Which code takes the values of the checkboxes and changes the style of the results though?
[07:40:48] <BillCriswell> j #css
[07:40:56] <BillCriswell> Opps.
[07:41:24] <JeroenDeDauw> I'm passing a string to $.trim(), and for some reason this is stopping execution of my JS, without throwing any error.
[07:41:24] <JeroenDeDauw> I have element.contents().each( function() { var foo = $.trim( this.data );
[07:41:24] <JeroenDeDauw> Where typeof this.data is "string"
[07:41:38] <JeroenDeDauw> Anyone an idea what might be going on? I'm a bit mystified.
[07:42:16] <JeroenDeDauw> (element is a jQuery object)
[07:42:25] <merrick> dxgriffiths:  let me find that.  one moment...
[07:43:20] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: you might have to post some code on jsfiddle or gisthub so we can help diagnose.
[07:44:03] <nokkusan> Good morning!
[07:44:20] <nokkusan> Can anyone answer a jQuery UI question?
[07:44:36] <TylerE> Number one rule of IRC, don't ask to ask, just ask.
[07:44:43] <nokkusan> Good point
[07:45:13] <nokkusan> I am "rolling my own theme" and then I click download, and what get's downloaded is all the default theme (grey)...this has worked in the past!
[07:45:57] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: sure, problematic code at line 133 here: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/LiveTranslate/includes/ext.lt.google.js?view=markup
[07:47:18] <nokkusan> I guess the question is: is anyone else having this issue?  I have tried with IE 8 and Chrome
[07:47:31] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: checking it out.
[07:51:43] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: what is this.data supposed to contain?
[07:55:11] <dxgriffiths> Strings of length greater than 0 presumably :)
[07:55:16] <JSM87> Hi guys, Im looking for something that can fully maximize and minimize a textarea to fill the screen. I dont need any features of a wysiwyg or their bloat. Just simply to maximize and then minimize (restore to its original position)
[07:55:40] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: the contents of the dom content node, a string
[07:55:49] <JeroenDeDauw> typeof this.data confirms it's a string
[07:56:07] <JeroenDeDauw> The string is a newline followed by a bunch of spaces in the first iteration, where it dies
[08:00:08] <kwaak> Hi, is is correct than when i'm using jQuery mobile framework, and I'm loading a second page (letting the framework handle it via Ajax) any <script> tags on the loaded page are not executed?
[08:00:32] <phlp> JeroenDeDauw: line 126 undefined should be in quotes
[08:03:10] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: Try adding an extra check like `&& this.data.match(/^\s*$/) == null` and see if it'll get past that first lot of whitespace.
[08:03:16] <JeroenDeDauw> phlp: sure, but that's not the issue
[08:03:31] <dxgriffiths> Before the trim.
[08:07:07] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: that code runs, but the result is not null
[08:09:09] <JeroenDeDauw> This is what I get when I console.log the result of that regex match:
[08:09:09] <JeroenDeDauw> ["\n								"]
[08:09:09] <JeroenDeDauw> 0 "\n								"
[08:09:09] <JeroenDeDauw> index 0
[08:09:09] <JeroenDeDauw> input "\n								"
[08:09:12] <JeroenDeDauw> Using FireBug that is
[08:11:02] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: Right, it'll only be null if there's something other than whitespace present.
[08:13:36] <Morkel> What does this code? "$(function() {......}
[08:13:38] <Morkel> "
[08:14:03] <dxgriffiths> Morkel: it's shorthand for supplying a function to run when the DOM is ready.
[08:14:07] <systemfault> Morkel: Same as $(document).ready(function()...
[08:14:15] <MickeySoFine> Hi All
[08:14:24] <Morkel> dxgriffiths, systemfault Thank you
[08:14:46] <MickeySoFine> how can I bind a class member function to a mousedown event?
[08:15:06] <systemfault> MickeySoFine: I would look for jQuery.proxy
[08:15:28] <systemfault> Or just use an inline closure..
[08:15:34] <systemfault> Both would work.
[08:16:22] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: that solved the issue, although now code exec is stopping at one of the checks in the if else part >_>
[08:17:42] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: which line?
[08:18:25] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: 147
[08:18:29] <dxgriffiths> k
[08:18:47] <JeroenDeDauw> Commenting out conditions I figured that it's not a single one that's causing the fail
[08:18:51] <JeroenDeDauw> At least 2 of them
[08:19:11] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: could it be that a text node wouldn't have an id attribute?
[08:20:09] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: yeah, that's it
[08:20:26] <JeroenDeDauw> I added "this.nodeType != 3 &&", which makes it work
[08:20:37] <dxgriffiths> Cool.
[08:21:48] <JeroenDeDauw> Meh
[08:21:55] <JeroenDeDauw> Now it's dying at the second iteration
[08:22:03] <janthony> http://pastie.org/2032811 - Any idea why this would trigger 30+ ajax requests instead of just one? Each ajax request has the same content in the response tab.
[08:22:08] <JeroenDeDauw> Probably the node does not have the spaces, and the trim is failing again
[08:22:56] <MickeySoFine> systemfault, I do this: $('myElement').mousedown( jQuery.proxy( this.mousedown, this ) );
[08:23:07] <MickeySoFine> inside my classes constructor
[08:23:19] <MickeySoFine> but the event doesnt seem to call my function
[08:23:43] <systemfault> Perhaps your selector isn't good
[08:24:02] <xec> janthony: maybe the click event got bound 30+ times?
[08:24:14] <systemfault> The one you're showing me now would select all elements of tag "myElement"
[08:24:37] <janthony> xec: Well I replaced $("#content").load($(this).attr("href")); with console.log('hello') and it only logged hello once.
[08:26:00] <dxgriffiths> janthony: yes, because the return false would stop any other bound handlers from being called anyhow. What does console.log($(this).attr("href")) generate?
[08:26:38] <xec> good point
[08:26:53] <janthony> dxgriffiths: Just tested that as well, it's only logging the current href.
[08:27:21] <dxgriffiths> janthony: and how many links are there?
[08:27:32] <MickeySoFine> systemfault, it appears the element is not created in the page at that point event though I have appened it to the parent element
[08:27:46] <janthony> dxgriffiths: 12 links
[08:27:48] <MickeySoFine> can I flush it to the page in some way?
[08:28:10] <janthony> dxgriffiths: In the menu that is.
[08:28:12] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: the issue with the conditions in the else if part appears to be doing $( this ), loose from the node type
[08:28:23] <dxgriffiths> MickeySoFine: you can use $(selector).live("mousedown"
[08:29:44] <dxgriffiths> janthony: where is the console.log when it prints out 30 times?
[08:30:15] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: you mean it's ignoring the node type check?
[08:30:50] <MickeySoFine> dxgriffiths, the selector is not yet valid as it doesnt exist in the dom yet
[08:30:55] <MickeySoFine> will that still work?
[08:30:58] <dxgriffiths> Yup.
[08:31:09] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: no, I mean that the prior assumption that that fail was caused by the node type being 3 (text node) is incorrect, as it fails even when it's not 3
[08:31:12] <freeed> Anyone know if there are plans to add touch support to jquery ui like draggable?
[08:31:27] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: oh, right.
[08:31:28] <JeroenDeDauw> And doing $(this) is enough to make it fail, so it's not the id attr either
[08:31:34] <freeed> ..without the use of an additional touch plugin?
[08:31:56] <MickeySoFine> ty! thats working awesome!
[08:31:59] <janthony> dxgriffiths: Wow, looks like it's being random now. With different results everytime. Sometimes it trys to load the page 5 times, some times 4 times, sometimes 7 times, etc. Like it's firing x amount of times randomy.
[08:32:01] <Vaerros> freeed: well, we've used the pbkakus(sp) jqueryui patch
[08:32:07] <Vaerros> freeed: works on iphone, ipad
[08:32:22] <Vaerros> and the android versions I tested
[08:32:27] <alaing> hi i have a container div with no set size I then have two inner divs. One is floated left and a wdith of 28%. Now the second div seems to drop below the first inner div if the width is wiider than the screen  but only in IE in FF it just stick them next to each other. any ideas?
[08:33:32] <cbobo> How can I get the label that is below an <input type="checkbox" /> <label>Stuff Here</label> ?
[08:33:52] <Vaerros> cbobo: next or siblings
[08:34:00] <alaing> $(':checkbox').next()
[08:34:05] <janthony> I think I figured it out. THanks!
[08:34:10] <freeed> Vaerros, got a link? googling that doesn't return anything :\
[08:34:12] <cbobo> okay, and then to get the value of the label, it is simply .val() ?
[08:34:15] <dxgriffiths> janthony: What was it?
[08:34:31] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: when you say it fails, what is it doing exactly?
[08:34:51] <cbobo>  check.sibling().val(); //like this?
[08:34:55] <janthony> dxgriffiths: I didn't change all of my templates yet, so some of the pages I was loading was loading a second #main-nav. So when I clicked on those pages it was adding more items of that select for the .click function
[08:34:58] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: stop code execution without throwing any error
[08:35:04] <alaing> can someone help me with a column column layout question?
[08:35:12] <alaing> two column
[08:35:51] <Vaerros> freeed: I *think* this is it: https://github.com/pbakaus/jquery-ui/tree/touchready
[08:36:11] <dxgriffiths> janthony: ah, thanks.
[08:36:15] <Vaerros> freeed: note that I only needed/tested draggable and droppable
[08:36:44] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: k. Do you have the latest version up?
[08:36:44] * JeroenDeDauw gives up for now
[08:37:02] <JeroenDeDauw> dxgriffiths: no, I'll try further later, thanks a lot for the help :)
[08:37:17] <dxgriffiths> JeroenDeDauw: no problem. Best of luck.
[08:43:08] <cbobo> How can I pass values into a function that is being called from .click ?
[08:43:39] <cbobo> Example: I am doing something like check.click(onClick);  then i have var onClick = function(datatopass) { stuff }
[08:44:07] <cbobo> i tried, check.click(onClick,"stuff to pass"); //however this does not populate the var datatopass
[08:44:11] <cbobo> what am I doing wrong?
[08:44:29] <Skola> what's the best way to animate the position of an image, performance-wise
[08:44:38] <systemfault> CSS3 :)
[08:44:40] <cbobo> also tried check.click('stuff2',onClick); still not working
[08:44:46] <Skola> right I feared that :p
[08:45:01] <freeed> I've noticed jquery mobile has been released and found some posts from julie 2010 from the jquery dev team stating they are working hard to add touch support to jquery ui... has this been accomplished? I can't find any info about it on the jquery blog and every post on the forum says to use a touch library, which won't work for my setup. ideas?
[08:45:09] <freeed> *july
[08:45:09] <Skola> it plays nice with jQuery I assume?
[08:45:13] <manwhocantbemove> is there anyway i can remove a file on multiple file input through jquery??
[08:45:30] <Skola> I really hate having my animations hanging somewhere between my stylesheets and my js :S
[08:45:36] <systemfault> Skola: I wouldn't bet on it. jQuery is made to work on every browser
[08:45:47] <Skola> yeah I thought of jQuery as fallback
[08:46:01] <Skola> buttt I'd much rather try to optimize the jQuery animations
[08:46:04] <Skola> they aren't huge
[08:46:14] <manwhocantbemove> hi all, is there anyway i can remove a selected file on a file input element??
[08:46:16] <Skola> but they happily eat up 100% CPU
[08:46:49] <Skola> does image compression help much?
[08:46:58] <systemfault> Unrelated afaik
[08:47:19] <Skola> I'm already going easy on the shadows and other fireworks
[08:47:31] <Skola> but need it smoother
[08:47:42] <AdvoWork> I've got: <input id="chosen_sortnew2" type="checkbox" checked="true" name="chosen_sortnew2"> and: $("#chosen_sortnew2 input:checkbox:checked").val() but i keep getting undefined, any ideas please?
[08:47:49] <mipo> hi
[08:48:02] <mipo> when I use jqueryuploadify
[08:48:09] <mipo> that send me this error!
[08:48:11] <cbobo> If I do something like: check.click(onClick("Stuff2")); //why can I not just do a var onClick = function (foo_) { alert(foo); }
[08:48:19] <cbobo> err function (foo)
[08:48:20] <mipo> $("#upload_files").uploadify is not a function
[08:48:22] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: you can use .click( [ eventData ], handler(eventObject) ), just remember that any properties you put in the eventData object will come through attached to the event.data object.
[08:48:22] <cbobo> thanks
[08:49:02] <cbobo> okay I will loook at the event object
[08:49:08] <TylerE> Does Jquery UI 1.8 *actually* work with jquery 1.3.2? Because for me the file errors on delegate not being a function. Delegate wasn't added until jquery 1.4.3
[08:49:46] <Skola> Tyler why use a version from the bronze age?
[08:49:52] <Skola> legacy code?
[08:50:04] <phlp> AdvoWork: use either the id or the input part of the selector. the space is meant to look for the input within the element that has that id which is not what you want
[08:50:05] <TylerE> yes
[08:50:09] <TylerE> it's an old drupal site
[08:50:16] <TylerE> and drupal really prefers exactly 1.3.2
[08:50:23] <Skola> terrible
[08:50:39] <Woet> and updating drupal is not a better option because..?
[08:50:41] <TylerE> I ask because jquery-ui *claims* to work with 1.3.
[08:51:01] <ajpiano> jquery ui 1.8 won't work with jquery 1.3
[08:51:03] <Skola> I don't think so
[08:51:06] <ajpiano> you have to use jquery ui 1.7.3
[08:51:09] <Woet> TylerE: it says 1.7.3
[08:51:10] <Woet> yes
[08:51:19] <TylerE> Woet: Because it's a highly cutomized legacy install, and many 3rd party modules we depend on don't work with newer drupal
[08:51:19] <Skola> yup
[08:51:28] <Woet> Quick downloads: Stable (Themes) (1.8.13: for jQuery 1.3.2+) | Legacy (Themes) (1.7.3: for jQuery 1.3+)
[08:51:43] <Woet> so use legacy jquery UI
[08:52:01] <TylerE> I can't. THe one thing I actually need is autocomplete
[08:52:03] <AdvoWork> phlp, i dont get you>? sorry
[08:52:06] <TylerE> which wasn't added until 1.8
[08:52:11] <TylerE> and I expected to work
[08:52:19] <cbobo> dxgriffiths: so I want to do something like var onClick = function(dataEvent) { alert(dataEvent.data) }; ? // In order to get the data that I passed to it?
[08:52:21] <TylerE> as Woet just pointed out, the website says 1.8.13 works with 1.3.2+
[08:52:23] <Skola> it won't work with 1.3.2-
[08:52:24] <Skola> :[
[08:52:32] <Woet> TylerE: i think that means higher than 1.3.2
[08:52:33] <TylerE> 1.3.2+ implies to me >= 1.3.2
[08:52:34] <ajpiano> TylerE: the copy is just unfortunatly slightly misleading
[08:52:36] <Skola> yep
[08:52:41] <TylerE> more than slightly misleading
[08:52:56] <TylerE> why not say jquery 1.4+ and be unambiguous about it?
[08:52:58] <Woet> it implies >= 1.3.2 to me too
[08:53:03] <phlp> AdvoWork: $("#chosen_sortnew2").val() should work, the input part of the selector on its own should also work, but both of them with a space separating will look for input within chosen_sortnew2 which doesnt make sense
[08:53:06] <Woet> but if you say it doesn't work, it implies > 1.3.2 apparently
[08:53:06] <ajpiano> TylerE, i'm trying to get that fixed now, it's super weird
[08:53:17] <ajpiano> unfortuntately, no matter how wrong that demarcation may be
[08:53:27] <ajpiano> that won't make autoocomplete magically work with 1.3.2
[08:56:01] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: That'll work. But dataEvent.data will contain other things aside from whatever you put in your custom object.
[08:56:02] <ajpiano> hm
[08:56:21] <cbobo> yes I know when I did that all i seen was an [Object]
[08:56:26] <cbobo> how can I access the string?
[08:57:04] <manwhocantbemove> how do you delete a file on a multiple input files?
[08:57:20] <systemfault> cbobo: How the hell are you getting that? Do you use alert to debug?
[08:57:47] <Skola> I use console.log allll the time, it's bad but it works :[]
[08:58:05] <cbobo> yes, I am using console.log however, for this example i said alert
[08:58:05] <systemfault> Skola: It's not bad..
[08:58:11] <cbobo> anyway, i am getting [object Object]
[08:58:14] <TylerE> Hah! Turns out it can work
[08:58:21] <TylerE> None of the autocomplete code depends on delegate
[08:58:23] <ajpiano> TylerE: yeah, i was in the middle of making a fiddle
[08:58:28] <Skola> well ya not that bad, but I also use it when I should write a test for it
[08:58:32] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: do console.dir instead.
[08:58:34] <ajpiano> i got corrected
[08:58:40] <TylerE> so if you build a custom download with JUST core and autocomplete, it does work
[08:58:41] <TylerE> cool
[08:58:51] <cbobo> okay I will change to console.dir and see if the results are different
[08:58:58] <TylerE> I was using googles hosted version which has everything
[08:59:12] <ajpiano> ah
[09:00:27] <TylerE> my lucky day I guess
[09:00:36] <cbobo> I get the same result
[09:02:00] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: which property are you trying to access?
[09:02:06] <cbobo> okay, console.dir(event); shows me some stuff
[09:02:10] <mateus73> Hi guys .. how can I get the current dimension X and Y of the browser window on JQuery?
[09:02:11] <cbobo> the one that I passed in
[09:02:25] <pdpi> Hey. I'm using jQuery.noConflict() to load two separate instances of jQuery. this arrangement works quite well, except that if I bind an event on one instance, and try to trigger it from the other, nothing happens
[09:02:36] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: so are you good now?
[09:02:38] <cbobo> you said that it converts it to an event object and then I use the event objet to get the data that I passed in
[09:02:42] <cbobo> hm not yet sir
[09:03:04] <cbobo> event.data is still undifined
[09:03:47] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: Click handlers always get an event object, all you're trying to do is add to the .data property of the event object.
[09:04:00] <phlp> mateus73: $(window).width();
[09:04:26] <dxgriffiths> .click({x: true}, function(event) { console.log(event.data.x) })
[09:04:29] <mateus73> phlp .. is the actual inner or outer width?
[09:05:33] <sgrover> having problems.  input box that *should* have a blur event handler.  Also have a blur handler on a div container a layer or two up from the input box.  This outer blur event never fires.
[09:06:08] <sgrover> Don't know why - can see it getting instantiated, but never fires.  Any thoughts?
[09:06:28] <cbobo> okay thank you sir, it is working
[09:06:34] <mateus73> Hey guys what is "this.offsetWidth" ?
[09:06:39] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: are you returning false at any stage?
[09:06:43] <dxgriffiths> cbobo: awesome.
[09:06:53] <sgrover> dxgriffiths: no.  cuz I don't want to stop bubbling.
[09:07:28] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: Can div elements blur?
[09:07:56] <sgrover> I would think that with event bubbling, it would intercept the blur from child elements... no?
[09:08:01] <yacc> Any idea if it's possible to concat jquery search results?
[09:08:34] <systemfault> yacc: jqapi.com is sometime better when you need to lookup for something..
[09:08:39] <ryanneufeld> anyone have any exp with .sort ?
[09:08:49] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: I googled it, blur events don't bubble up.
[09:08:53] <systemfault> A shame though, the search on api.jquery.com is just plain bad.
[09:08:54] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to figure out why this works in FF
[09:08:58] <ryanneufeld> but not chrome http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/AVBQM/2/
[09:09:11] <sgrover> dxgriffiths: I did see reference to that, but the docs I found seemed dated...
[09:09:43] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: Your experiment seems to confirm that it's correct, unfortunately.
[09:10:02] <sgrover> thanks.  So much for the "fast" fix then... :)
[09:11:31] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: This might be useful to you somehow: https://gist.github.com/162593
[09:11:53] <janthony> How would you animate to a margin: 0 auto; since you can't use shorthand properties with animate?
[09:12:39] <sgrover> dxgriffiths: thanks.  saw similar at http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/delegating_the.html
[09:13:04] <dxgriffiths> sgrover: ok no worries. Good luck with it.
[09:13:29] <dxgriffiths> janthony: marginLeft, marginRight, marginTop, marginBottom?
[09:13:44] <ryanneufeld> nvm, figured it out
[09:14:02] <janthony> dxgriffiths: Yeah, I tried: marginTop: 0, marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto' but didn't work
[09:15:11] <dxgriffiths> janthony: "In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings 'show', 'hide', and 'toggle'." Doesn't sound like auto is supported.
[09:15:37] <janthony> dxgriffiths: Gotchya. I'll have to look into an alternative method for doing this.
[09:16:29] <khaan> hi guys: sorry first and foremost for being a total n00b. I'm trying to load the content of a portion of an external page into a modal window. I ws trying to do something inline like <a href="javascript:function(){jQuery.load("<?php the_permalink() ?> #content";)}" - is that wrong?
[09:18:01] <dxgriffiths> khaan: It is a bit wrong, yeah.
[09:18:22] <khaan> dxgriffiths: what's the proper syntax please? :)
[09:20:59] <systemfault> KayT3: You might need to "echo" the link
[09:21:05] <systemfault> (Also)
[09:21:51] <dxgriffiths> khaan: Remove the outer function, and make it jQuery("#content").load("<? ?>")
[09:21:55] <KayT3> hmm
[09:22:10] <khaan> dxgriffiths: trying
[09:24:23] <khaan> dxgriffiths: btw #content is the part i should be loading from within the outside page...
[09:24:47] <dxgriffiths> khaan: oh, right.
[09:25:17] <pdpi> so, can anyone help me with events not working properly with two versions of jquery running in parallel? http://jsfiddle.net/mbCYJ/
[09:26:03] <khaan> dxgriffiths: so how could it be in that case?
[09:26:18] <ajpiano> khaan: you shouldn't be using onclick events
[09:26:23] <ajpiano> you should just put the link in the href
[09:26:27] <ajpiano> and then in jquery
[09:26:29] <ajpiano> do something like
[09:27:27] <khaan> ajpiano: i was trying something like <a class="colorbox-link" href="javascript:jQuery.load("<?php the_permalink() ?> #content")" >
[09:27:29] <ajpiano> $(function() { $("a.foo").click(function(e) {  $("#container").load(this.href + " #content");        }) ;    });
[09:27:38] <devinrolsen> morning all.
[09:27:55] <ajpiano> don't use javascript: or onclick or anything
[09:27:58] <dxgriffiths> khaan: you just have to specify an element for the content to go into.
[09:28:00] <ajpiano> bind events in javascript/jquery
[09:28:24] <khaan> content is loaded within the colorbox modal window
[09:28:29] <khaan> with the colorbox-link class
[09:28:38] <khaan> maybe i could generate another class as above and add it to that
[09:29:32] <dxgriffiths> khaan: jQuery("#colorbox").load(... if that's the id of the modal.
[09:30:23] <khaan> i will have to check if that's the name of the part
[09:30:36] <devinrolsen> I finally got a working copy of my script that will perform a global (not single page reports only) report of un-used selectors in your style sheets. http://tinyurl.com/3hzngcl check it out.
[09:30:57] <devinrolsen> Should help quickly audit large style sheets for some sites that need some clean up.
[09:31:07] <khaan> yes it's #colorbox
[09:31:48] <dxgriffiths> khaan: do you understand why it has to be jQuery(target).load(source data) ?
[09:31:57] <khaan> sure
[09:32:04] <dxgriffiths> Cool.
[09:32:04] <khaan> crystal clear to me
[09:32:05] <khaan> :)
[09:32:51] <khaan> dxgriffiths: my best next guess is class="colorbox-link" href="javascript:jQuery("#colorbox").load("<?php the_permalink() ?> #content")"
[09:33:10] <dxgriffiths> khaan: does it work?
[09:33:21] <khaan> dxgriffiths lol no :)
[09:34:20] <dxgriffiths> khaan: Make sure you're either escaping those double quotes or using single quotes inside the href string.
[09:35:04] <crankharder> what's the correct way to access the clicked element inside a click event?
[09:35:16] <ajpiano> crankharder: event.target
[09:35:47] <dxgriffiths> ajpiano: why not this?
[09:35:53] <ajpiano> same diff
[09:36:01] <dxgriffiths> crankharder: this.
[09:36:07] <ajpiano> you could screw around with this
[09:36:12] <ajpiano> and set it to be something else
[09:36:20] <ajpiano> event.target will always be the clicked element
[09:36:34] <ajpiano> no matter whether you've $.proxy'd the function, etc
[09:37:09] <dxgriffiths> crankharder: get all that?
[09:37:49] <pdpi> Anyone know why when you have two separate instances of jQuery, bind() one one instance doesn't pick up on the other's trigger() calls? http://jsfiddle.net/mbCYJ/
[09:38:05] <crankharder> yea, thanx :)
[09:38:22] <Kaapa> pdpi: that's weird - I was expecting the mouseup / mousedown effect to propagate to both $ and $m ....
[09:38:55] <Kaapa> pdpi: the bind gets registered against the dom?
[09:38:58] <ajpiano> pdpi: because they have separate storage areas for the events
[09:39:01] <Kaapa> or against the jquery wrapper?
[09:39:06] <eddiemonge> pdpi, you need to use noconflict when using multiple versions of jquery
[09:39:07] <ajpiano> and they're separate instances
[09:39:10] <ajpiano> so that's kind of the point
[09:39:48] <pdpi> ajpiano: I'd expect that the events would be more or less indistinguishable from "regular" events triggered by the user
[09:40:05] <ajpiano> triggered events and native events are in fact quite different
[09:40:07] <pdpi> eddiemonge: yeah, I am using noConflict()
[09:40:49] <pdpi> right. In that case, is there a workaround you can suggest?
[09:41:38] <Tidwell> pdpi: you still need to bind and trigger from both jquery namespaces - or just move all the code dealing with it into using only one of the jquery namespaces (recommended)
[09:42:50] <pdpi> Tidwell: yeah, that would've been my preferred approach. Except what I'm working on is a wrapper application sort of thing. It uses jQuery and a set of plugins to do its thing, and then loads an inner page that also uses jQuery, with a different set of plugins
[09:42:56] <pdpi> and different settings
[09:43:51] <pdpi> hence the need for two instances. But then I need (from the wrapper point of view) to be able to tell when the inner page is sending notifications like "finished processing" -- preferably without making changes to the inner page
[09:44:45] <Tidwell> pdpi: ouch :( - i suppose you could write a wrapper for .bind and .trigger that does it in both namespaces...but that seems like it would result in such a huge freaking mess - and you would have to modify your code in both places
[09:45:58] <necromancer> is there a performance hit when you use jsonp over json?
[09:46:21] <ajpiano> kind of like asking if there's a perf hit with a boat compared to a car
[09:46:28] <ajpiano> you can travel places in a boat you can't travel in a car, and vice versa.
[09:46:33] <Tidwell> necromancer: what?  jsonp is used when you need to go cross-domain
[09:46:46] <necromancer> right but jsonp also works when you're on the same domain
[09:46:57] <ajpiano> doing jsonp to your own domain is pretty silly
[09:47:06] <necromancer> i needed to do it once
[09:47:11] <Tidwell> ajpiano: unless you're using your own public api
[09:47:12] <necromancer> couldn't figure out why
[09:47:22] <ajpiano> i suppose
[09:47:28] <ajpiano> it's not unreasonable to do it
[09:47:35] <ajpiano> in any case, perf isn't really a concern
[09:47:43] <necromancer> yeah there's just extra code you have to write for jsonp, basically
[09:47:57] <ajpiano> yeah, the letter "p" in your dataType option
[09:47:58] <ajpiano> :p
[09:48:01] <Tidwell> yea, the overhead in both cases is in the http request - executing an anonymous function is trivial
[09:48:06] <Tidwell> lol
[09:48:38] <necromancer> ajpiano: nah if you're writing PHP on the backend you have to respond with $_GET['callback']."(".json_encode($someArray).")"
[09:57:25] <meowsus> I'm running into an issue with the following code. Both the hover-in and out functions work fine. In the OUT I'm trying to remove what i've done in the IN via $(whatever).removeAttr("style"). It works in linux Firefox, IE7-9 and Windows Firefox, but not webkit or mac firefox, since the .removeAttr("style") call isn't actually removing the style attribute
[09:57:26] <meowsus> http://pastie.org/2033226
[09:57:42] <meowsus> Any idea why that would be?
[09:59:41] <djQuery> meowsus: because those browsers are kinda  protecting the style attribute?
[10:00:44] <meowsus> djQuery, well... damn it... That was the most elegant way i could think to do it. Do i have to reset everything line by line? or is there another way to just revert everything done on the hover IN easily?
[10:00:57] <djQuery> meowsus: and by the way if you have allready done child = $(this).find("ul");   you dont need to do $(child).innerWidth(); you can just do child.innerWidth();
[10:02:28] <nym> hey guys, i'm doing a review of various frameworks
[10:02:32] <nym> https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak8IPGG6Z4dOdFBGbmlvSG0xR3lETEEycGMzSS1rdVE&hl=en_US
[10:02:33] <meowsus> djQuery, good catch. I guess that adds more unnecessary load, since it's already a jQ object
[10:02:35] <nym> (ui frameworks)
[10:02:45] <nym> if you have any suggestions, i would appreciate it
[10:03:36] <meowsus> So Chrome / Safari won't let jQuery remove the style attribute... is that it?
[10:04:29] <djQuery> meowsus: yes there were a lotta unnessary declaration of global variables, check this out instead http://pastie.org/2033277
[10:04:57] <djQuery> meowsus: it wont fix ur issue but it whould be faster\less overhead
[10:05:16] <ajpiano> meowsus: i haven't heard of that except for see ?9500
[10:05:17] <bot-t> meowsus, [#9500]  (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9500
[10:07:05] <djQuery> meowsus: couldnt you work around it by doing $(this).setAttr('style', '');
[10:07:23] <djQuery> just set it to nothing
[10:08:27] <meowsus> djQuery, right on, thanks, and apparently setAttr("style") does not play nice either
[10:08:30] <meowsus> I'll keep hammering around at it
[10:08:34] <meowsus> Thanks for the tips tho
[10:08:43] <ajpiano> there is no such thing as setAttr
[10:08:51] <djQuery> nym: listing the file size is a little missleading seeing as you dont have to load all of the ui unless your just to lazy just get the items that you need.
[10:08:55] <ajpiano> .attr("style", "") but that's what removeAttr is supposed to do
[10:09:32] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[10:09:42] <djQuery> nym: you might also want to list the ones that have a good CDN as the cdn would eliminate the file size as being a consideration in most cases
[10:10:28] <dtach> im trying to load a script with getScript and then run a function inside, but it's failing, but when i load the script as <script> in my doc the functions do work. http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/v3kgq/
[10:10:44] <dtach> but jsfiddle now adds a 404 error which i dont get
[10:10:59] <djQuery> dtach: have you looked at yep\nope.
[10:11:02] <nym> djQuery: yes, although i want to include an entire framework
[10:11:16] <dtach> at what?
[10:11:21] <nym> djQuery: i don't expect to be the only consumer, i'm working on the locker project
[10:11:31] <nym> http://lockerproject.org/
[10:11:33] <djQuery> nym: then you need to compare the individual widget that the frameworks comefrom
[10:11:45] <nym> dji'm sorry?
[10:11:51] <nym> djQuery: what do you mean
[10:11:53] <djQuery> dtach: see ?yepnope.js
[10:12:00] <bot-t> dtach, Wednesday, 2011-05-25 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110525.log.html
[10:12:41] <dtach> djQuery: nice, but maxmind is my 3rd fallback right now :)
[10:13:12] <dtach> oh nvm that comment
[10:14:03] <dtach> but i only want to load the script when the other checks for geolocation fail
[10:18:03] <djQuery> ?ui.tabs@ajpiano
[10:18:04] <bot-t> ajpiano, Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space. http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[10:19:03] <dtach> it was the cache messing up the url that broke it
[10:19:18] <dtach> mean getscript default setting
[10:20:03] <znow> I need to get a value that updates every 2 sec, from an external website, a stock value, how could I retrieve this by jquery and show it on my own site?
[10:20:40] <djQuery> znow: 2 secs? kinda intensive isnt it?
[10:21:07] <Skola> frmo an external site?
[10:21:13] <Skola> every 2 sec?
[10:21:15] <Skola> you're brave
[10:21:17] <djQuery> znow: ?sop
[10:21:25] <znow> djQuery: well that is just a test value, my quest is to retrieve the whole C20 index of stock values and get it on my own site, well some of the C20 stock values
[10:21:26] <djQuery> znow: see ?sop
[10:21:27] <bot-t> znow, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[10:21:48] <eddiemonge> znow, there should be an api to do that for the site you want to get it from
[10:21:49] <znow> Skola: just an example
[10:22:01] <dabbish> how do I return a value from a callback function? Should I just put the value in some div instead or what is the preferred way of doing it?
[10:22:01] <Skola> ja but you can't get stuff from other domain
[10:22:05] <meowsus> djQuery, thanks man, got it working. $(this).attr("style","") works fine
[10:22:06] <znow> eddiemonge: I do not know if I can get access to the API
[10:22:29] <djQuery> znow: and if there isnt you would need to do screen scraping on the server side to get it to work.
[10:22:40] <znow> djQuery: yeah
[10:22:52] <Skola> what backend you got? :[]
[10:22:58] <znow> but its just 5 stock values, that gets updated now and then
[10:23:02] <znow> Skola: RoR
[10:23:04] <eddiemonge> znow,  if you cant get access then you shouldnt be using it
[10:23:39] <eddiemonge> znow,  if its for stocks, there are plenty of sites that have apis you can tap into
[10:24:01] <znow> eddiemonge: its a danish C20 index, its called... dunno what site I should head for?
[10:25:04] <eddiemonge> ?g danish C20 index api
[10:25:05] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Mycella | Define Mycella at Dictionary.com - http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mycella
[10:25:24] <djQuery> znow: see ?lmgtfy CSO index api
[10:25:24] <bot-t> znow, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[10:26:01] <znow> djQuery: I already tried that, sir... nothing that I could see was worth looking into
[10:26:24] <Know1edge> What is the best way to find at what level deep a nested ul li is?
[10:30:13] <djQuery> Know1edge: thats an intresting Q.      var par = $(this).closest('li'), x = par.length, lvl = 0   while(x!==0){  par = par.closest('li'); lvl++; x = par.length;  }
[10:30:45] <djQuery> Know1edge: something to start with anyway
[10:30:59] <djQuery> might need to use parent instead of closest.
[10:31:40] <djQuery> znow: what is the site u are tryin to get it from now?
[10:31:44] <Know1edge> thanks djQuery ill give it a shot
[10:32:12] <znow> djQuery: I had a look at borsen.dk which is the Danish site for stock values and stuff.. but I headed over to euroinvestor.com to see if they had any thing I could use
[10:34:21] <znow> djQuery: I can see euroinvestor has a "stream" bla bla javascript, and the stream is used in the stock value's span tags
[10:40:39] <gym_jane> xec?
[10:45:45] <plov> if i had a grid of thumbnails and i wanted each click to load the corressponding image into a designated <div id="#full_image> area, would use load() be right?
[10:46:33] <djQuery> plov: no     $('#thumbnailcontainer').delegate(
[10:48:28] <djQuery> plov: $('#thumbnailcontainer').delegate('.thumbnailclass', 'click', function(){ var url=this.href.replace('thumbnail', '')  $("#bigimage').attr('src', url);   });
[10:49:17] <djQuery> plov: need to work out how to get the url your self as I dont know what you naming convention is for thumbnails\fullsize
[10:49:40] <plov> djQuery: yea, thank you, looking over the doc
[11:06:30] <plov> djQuery: apparently delegate can only follow tags? and not id/class ?
[11:07:27] <plov> for instance $('div').delegate('img'... works but $('#divcontainer).delegate('#thumbnails'.. won't
[11:08:15] <mipo> how to change browse button of file tag?
[11:08:59] <nail_> it works on any selector, but do you actually need .delegate()? If all your thumbnails are already present, you don't
[11:09:25] <eugeneBear> is there a way to display images on jquery mobile so that it fits within the mobile screen?
[11:09:59] <plov> nail_: i dont know, i'm just trying to when thumbnails are clicked load the full sized image in a designated #full_image area
[11:10:01] <mipo> nail_  you are with me?
[11:10:19] <mipo> nail_  sorry! I am wrong!
[11:10:42] <nail_> plov: so you don't fetch your thumbnails via ajax, right?
[11:10:47] <plov> nail_: i dont know the terminology ehre, but i'm guessing selector means HTML tags only? and it can't follow objects like #container .class
[11:10:55] <plov> nail_: nope
[11:11:11] <plov> thumbnails are loaded when page is first rendered
[11:11:25] <nail_> mipo: eh? :)
[11:11:29] <plov> i'm just trying to fetch the full image whenever thumbnails are clicked
[11:11:40] <mipo> nothing!
[11:12:14] <nail_> plov: no, selector are like CSS selectors (and some more)
[11:12:41] <nail_> plov: so you can just .bind/.click
[11:13:02] <plov> nail_: so is using delegate the right approach?
[11:13:20] <nail_> that will work, but .bind or .click are sufficient enough
[11:14:24] <plov> nail_: but if i use .bind or .click then i'd need to add a .load to fetch the image?
[11:14:40] <nail_> so, like $('.thumbnail').click(function() { $('#bigimage').attr('src', url); })
[11:15:05] <nail_> you don't need to load the image, changing the src attribute of an <img> tag will get it
[11:15:27] <plov> oh really, ok cool
[11:15:38] <mangos> hi! how can i make it so once a person clicks a click, that single link will load external pages into two separate DIVs?
[11:15:52] <eugeneBear> hi all, is there a way to display header images on a jquery mobile site so that it fits within the mobile screen?
[11:16:13] <elb0w`> Whats wrong with this? $("button[title='refresh']).click();
[11:16:16] <elb0w`> I want it to fire that button
[11:18:26] <nail_> elb0w`: you are missing a closing "
[11:18:52] <elb0w`> nail_: I just retyped that here
[11:18:57] <elb0w`> not on the actual page, its fine
[11:19:18] <freeed> eugeneBear, you probably need to specify this the device width in meta, like so: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
[11:19:37] <nail_> elb0w`: then there's nothing wrong, that will trigger the click handlers
[11:19:53] <eugeneBear> thanks freeed
[11:20:01] <elb0w`> nail_: I want to trigger the button press
[11:20:05] <elb0w`> as if the user clicked the button
[11:20:09] <eugeneBear> is the device width something i can call to get dynamically?
[11:20:10] <elb0w`> is it equiv to js .click() ?
[11:20:33] <eugeneBear> or do i need to sniff for the device and have predefined widths?
[11:20:40] <freeed> eugeneBear, dunno.. I just use that on all my mobile sites, scales appropriately for each device
[11:21:02] <freeed> eugeneBear, oh no, use that as-is
[11:21:08] <eugeneBear> oh ok
[11:21:09] <eugeneBear> ty
[11:21:13] <freeed> yah
[11:21:29] <elb0w`> Hmm, looks like its not finding it. Do I have to do something special for an iframe?
[11:21:53] <Rogi> is there a defacto way of transitioning through image gallery with jquery? Or is it still tricky and not handled in a generic way? (trying to stay away from plugins)
[11:22:02] <ajpiano> $("#yourIframe").contents().find(".something") elb0w`
[11:22:12] <elb0w`> ya just found that doc
[11:22:12] <elb0w`> thanks
[11:22:50] <freeed> ajpiano, love the bocoup site :) especially the source :)
[11:22:57] <ajpiano> :)
[11:23:35] <elb0w`> ajpiano: what if its in a frame in a frame?
[11:23:47] <elb0w`> do I chain at contents? or find
[11:25:05] <ajpiano> .contents().find("anotheriframe").contents().find() etc
[11:26:55] <elb0w`> ok
[11:27:23] <elb0w`> nice got it
[11:27:29] <elb0w`> ty
[11:28:03] <cerzi> hi all, im trying to create a modal dialogbox in jquery ui, but when it's clicked theres no overlay effect - instead, a load of whitespace seems to get added to the bottom of the page. anyone know what this could be?
[11:28:37] <Tidwell> cerzi: missing the jqueryUI css?
[11:28:49] <cerzi> *slapself* thats probably it, ta :)
[11:29:01] <GoGoGarrett> :P
[11:33:05] <cerzi> ok, so ive got the stylesheet linked and now its working properly, except the page seems to jump a few pixels to the left when the dialog pops up.. is that normal?
[11:35:06] <novadragon|2> hi all
[11:35:17] <novadragon|2> how are you all doing
[11:35:59] <novadragon|2> i am having a problem of using this script http://www.agilecarousel.com/carousel_example.htm in cmsms
[11:36:09] <alexwait> a function I am calling in jQuery.ready() clearing is running *after* the DOM has been loaded. Is this expected?
[11:36:34] <plov> how would i get the src of a img object ?
[11:37:04] <Tidwell> plov:   yourImageObject.src
[11:37:21] <plov> well that was easy lol
[11:37:25] <Tidwell> plov: or jquerified $(imgObject).attr('src')
[11:37:39] <balr0g> hello, why Chrome doest display the JSON info, and FF and IE do?: http://pastebin.com/z6kvyxJv
[11:37:57] <novadragon|2> hi
[11:38:44] <novadragon|2> http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/pastebin/4402
[11:38:54] <novadragon|2> it is lovly been ignored
[11:39:11] <novadragon|2> i cant get this script to work in cmsms
[11:39:20] <Tidwell> novadragon|2: im not familiar with that script, or cmsms, sorry
[11:39:49] <novadragon|2> it just doesnt load
[11:39:59] <novadragon|2> i get no errors
[11:40:19] <novadragon|2> as far as i know everything is correct
[11:40:49] <Tidwell> novadragon|2: what... it looks like you're making an ajax call... that has a document.ready inside of the callback function... that is certainly not right
[11:41:18] <novadragon|2> hw do i fix it
[11:41:29] <novadragon|2> =noobie
[11:42:54] <Tidwell> novadragon|2: you dont want to make the ajax call until document.ready so, get rid of it from inside the callback and put the ajax call inside of a document.ready
[11:43:24] <novadragon|2> please give me an example
[11:43:45] <ravenzz> novadragon|2 you should try to replace the $.getJSON with $.ajax
[11:43:56] <ravenzz> and then debug it
[11:44:29] <ravenzz> adding some breakpoints within the success: error: and complete
[11:44:33] <ravenzz> callbacks
[11:44:52] <novadragon|2> i am a noob at this
[11:44:52] <ravenzz> btw json = samedomain
[11:45:15] <ravenzz> is your page hosted on forum.esquire
[11:45:15] <ravenzz> ?
[11:45:30] <novadragon|2> yes
[11:46:36] <necromancer> ravenzz: getJSON uses jsonp, which allows cross-domain communication
[11:47:03] <novadragon|2> i am lost now
[11:48:13] <novadragon|2> so i replace $.getJSON with $.ajax
[11:48:38] <novadragon|2> then where do i call $.getJSON
[11:49:16] <ravenzz> you haven't to do that
[11:51:16] <ravenzz> novadragon|2 http://pastie.org/2033763
[11:51:23] <ravenzz> something like that
[11:52:31] <ravenzz> then look at your console to see what happens
[11:53:13] <novadragon|2> but the tld is missing in that request
[11:54:05] <novadragon|2> it should be http://forum.esquire.co.za/ the rest of the code
[11:54:29] <ravenzz> you have to make a requesto to http://forum.esquire.co.za/
[11:54:31] <ravenzz> ?
[11:54:33] <novadragon|2> but i am so lost
[11:54:43] <novadragon|2> what you guys saing to me i dont get
[11:56:15] <novadragon|2> i was using this http://www.agilecarousel.com/carousel_example.htm
[11:57:16] <ravenzz> novadragon|2 1st of all you have to understand if your ajax (getJSON) success or fails
[11:57:46] <novadragon|2> i undersand
[11:57:59] <novadragon|2> that
[11:58:10] <novadragon|2> but the link was wrong
[11:59:23] <ravenzz> which one? http://forum.esquire/uploads/gallery_script/agile_carousel_data.ph this?
[12:00:33] <novadragon|2> http://pastie.org/2033805
[12:00:37] <novadragon|2> look there
[12:00:46] <novadragon|2> yes that link
[12:04:55] <novadragon|2> yes
[12:06:43] <crankharder> is there a jquery way to do math on css('left')
[12:06:52] <crankharder> which returns a string ('100px')
[12:06:52] <Know1edge> whats the most efficient way to find if a an li has children
[12:07:11] <crankharder> ...or do I have to parse out the 'px' and then do math
[12:07:18] <Know1edge> children().size() > 0 ?
[12:07:34] <djQuery> ?size
[12:07:34] <bot-t> .size(): Return the number of DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[12:07:36] <crankharder> if(foobar.children().length)
[12:08:04] <djQuery> hmmm didnt know about size. seems kinda redundent when .length works find
[12:08:04] <BrandonZacharie> Know1edge: liElement.children.length
[12:09:53] <djQuery> ajpiano: with the rewrite of ui.tabs I know add is going away. is remove history as well?
[12:10:11] <djQuery> or rather does anyone know ^^^^^^^
[12:10:15] <ajpiano> i do belive so
[12:12:33] <janthony> Is there a way to animiate() an element on and off the screen w/o using position absolute? Like if I wanted it to fly in from the top left of the screen to the center of the screen. I would do margin, but I understand margin: 0 auto; isn't supported with.antimate()
[12:14:35] <djQuery> hmmm how to get the index of an li in a ul
[12:14:55] <djQuery> anyway without doing a loop through each one.
[12:15:07] <djQuery> I know the text of the li
[12:16:03] <trustedsage> Newbie Question: Does Jquery provide the functionality to select portion of displayed text in browser and then highlight selected text and background of selected text in other colors/fonts?
[12:17:26] <wolfe> no dojo devs here, what a shame :/
[12:26:06] <janthony> Is it possible to animate an element in from the top left of the screen to the center of the screen w/o position: absolute?
[12:26:34] <cerzi> im trying to set a click() action for clicking on an image in a modal window, using $(".db_img").click(function() { ...[close dialog, set an attribute[ (db_img is the class of these modal window images). however, opening the page with this new code causes the modal window content to spill onto the main page body before even doing anything..
[12:33:56] <eddiemonge> janthony, not very easily why?
[12:34:14] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ cerzi
[12:34:14] <bot-t> cerzi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[12:34:23] <janthony> eddiemonge: hehe, trying to animate elements on and off the screen to come in from top left into the center, top right into the center, etc.
[12:34:40] <eddiemonge> janthony,  but why without positioning?
[12:34:56] <janthony> eddiemonge: because the position they land to is margin: 0 auto;
[12:35:10] <janthony> to keep the element horizontally centered on the screen
[12:35:19] <eddiemonge> djQuery, you mean you want to find a li in a ul that has a certain text string in it?
[12:35:30] <janthony> also the absolute position element is not stretching horizontally when content is added to the element
[12:35:37] <janthony> er, vertically
[12:35:45] <eddiemonge> janthony, ok well it sounds like you need to fix your css
[12:36:19] <janthony> eddiemonge: I don't think absolute positioned elements can get bigger based on their content/child elements and have to have a height specified in the css.
[12:41:18] <Reite> How do I do "if (foo.length in [1, 2])" ?
[12:41:50] <djQuery> eddiemonge: I want to find the index of the li in the ul where the id of the li is some var
[12:42:15] <djQuery> Reite: see ?.contains
[12:42:15] <bot-t> Reite, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[12:43:17] <djQuery> Reite: errr rather see ?.inArray
[12:43:17] <bot-t> Reite, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[12:43:57] <djQuery> Reite: hmmm that might help with my issue
[12:44:21] <Reite> thanks
[12:44:23] <Reite> glad to help :P
[12:44:33] <necromancer> janthony: they don't have to have a height/width but it's best if they do. much easier to deal with
[12:46:49] <amid_hasan> hi
[12:47:50] <rixius> ajpiano: I need a tip for when you start working at a dayjob and their JS and jQuery is off-the-wall bat-sh*t stupid >_>
[12:48:03] <ajpiano> ok?
[12:48:25] <ajpiano> um, basically... you should use your shorter sword to slice your belly open and ensure an honourable death
[12:48:36] <ajpiano> sorry i've been learning about samurais
[12:48:40] <rixius> lol
[12:48:46] <rixius> sounds like a good plan ._.
[12:48:59] <rixius> but on a serious note, whens a new yayQuery comin'?
[12:49:09] <ajpiano> who knows
[12:49:11] <rixius> maybe a liveStreamed event at TXJS?
[12:49:24] <rixius> fi you're all four makin it?
[12:49:28] <rixius> s/fi/if
[12:49:28] <ajpiano> we'll all be there
[12:50:31] <djQuery> does inArray work on a jquery object?
[12:51:49] <Skola> what are you gonna test for?
[12:52:08] <djQuery> Skola: if an element is in it
[12:53:56] <Skola> you mean by ID or something?
[12:53:58] <Skola> $.inArray($('a').attr('href'), "/")
[12:54:00] <Skola> this works
[12:54:10] <ngharo> huh
[12:54:10] <Skola> if there's a link on my page which has href "/"
[12:54:17] <Skola> for example, but it's a bit backwards
[12:55:26] <djQuery> Skola: dont think your example would work as thats a string not an array
[12:56:34] <djQuery> Skola: you would need to split it first to be an array wouldnt you? or else just use $('a').attr('href').indexOf('/')
[12:56:54] <djQuery> which would probably be faster anyway
[12:57:04] <jeff_b> Anyone here have insight on how to use jquery.poppable? Or a pointer to something similar?

[12:58:00] <jeff_b> Yeah, that's where I started, but it has no usage instructions
[12:58:06] <djQuery> jeff_b: well seeing as how the plugin page for it has no documentation I wouldnt think so
[12:58:18] <djQuery> are u just lookin for a tooltip kinda thing?
[12:58:41] <jeff_b> Probably. Just want to pop over a simple box when a link is clicked
[12:59:10] <djQuery> there are a ton of tooltip plugins
[13:00:26] <jeff_b> Yep, I'll probably end up with another since poppable is also inscrutable ...

[13:08:31] <Krinkle> look at the second form on the page, perhaps that's what you want ?
[13:08:35] <glen1> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio - in the view source it says $( "#radio" ).button set, but the radio elements ids are radio1,radio2,radio3. How does that work
[13:08:45] <Krinkle> It takes care of the link between the image and the actual <form>, so you can change the css/imags etc.

[13:14:41] <djQuery> dont realy know what you are asking for there though
[13:14:55] <roddy> i'm wondering whether I've come across a bug - is it ok for $.filter() to error (in FF/IE, not in chrome) on certain strings? (tested with .ui-dialog:after, which indeed is not quite a valid selector, but the error halts the rest of the scripts)
[13:15:02] <roddy> (hi :)
[13:15:04] <djQuery> and that wasnt the link I was hopin for
[13:15:13] <m0dmd> hi :)
[13:15:23] <Krinkle> Why is the "selector" module not in the testswarm ?
[13:15:29] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1229/ (latest)
[13:15:51] <Krinkle> It has two failing tests, now there's no way of tracing when they failed...
[13:15:57] <deam> why does this result in an unrecognized expression? $("input[@name='conditions_radio']").change(function() {
[13:16:10] <djQuery> Krinkle: did you mean to ask in dev?
[13:16:10] <clarkbox> re getting the checked checkboxes in a collection - given that i already have a selector with all my checkboxes - is this the best way to get only the selected boxes out of the existing collection/selector: http://jsfiddle.net/ZU2Sd/

[13:17:24] <balr0g> ngharo, Krinkle, this is the output: http://pastebin.com/kSbx0qvx
[13:17:36] <clarkbox> this seems funky, in that jquery would have to deserialize the cbx selector (jQuery(cbx +':checked')). wouldnt there be a better way

[13:18:00] <janthony> I noticed that images being loaded is not included in $(document).ready() and the document will be ready for jquery execution before images are being loaded. Is there a way to do a conditional statement to state if all images from this container are finished loading, execute this jquery code?
[13:18:10] <clarkbox> thanks djQuery
[13:18:17] <janthony> before images are fully loaded*
[13:18:54] <m0dmd> like image preloading..
[13:18:59] <Krinkle> janthony: When the HTML is loaded/ready then document.ready fires
[13:19:07] <Krinkle> when all images are loaded, window.load fires.
[13:19:24] <Krinkle> $("#myDiv").load( function(){ .. }). might work
[13:19:32] <Krinkle> otherwise $(window).load
[13:19:40] <djQuery> janthony: var images = $('img').length; $('img').load(function(){  images--; if (images==0){ funkyfunk(); }    })
[13:20:17] <m0dmd> das funky
[13:20:19] <m0dmd> :)
[13:20:24] <clarkbox> hey djquery, why doesnt .find work?
[13:20:34] <djQuery> clarkbox: dunno
[13:20:48] <djQuery> because it only searches child elements?
[13:20:55] <janthony> Krinkle: I have 3000x3000 px images (5 of them) loading in a container to run through .cycle() , .cycle() shouldn't be able to load until the document is finished loading. However, it loads but when it gets to the second image, the image is still being downloaded to the client.
[13:21:08] <roddy> deam: waiting on my own answer but here's a shot, i believe you don't need the apostrophes , so try $( "input[@name=conditions_radio]" ).change( .. ) ?
[13:21:29] <m0dmd> janthony thats the reason to preload ur images
[13:22:03] <deam> roddy: I figured it out, I was using the old jquery syntax.. unfortunately
[13:22:16] <janthony> m0dmd: Right, which is what I'm going to do, but trying to figure out the conditional statement to do that.
[13:22:39] <deam> btw, I don't know if any jquery devs are around here, but thanks for making javascript a less painfull experience for a Python programmer! :D
[13:22:42] <janthony> djQuery: I'll try your method and see if that helps
[13:23:45] <janthony> Maybe I'm confused because I guess they aren't being preloaded due to them being display: none;
[13:27:04] <ngharo> balr0g: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416
[13:27:30] <djQuery> roddy: deam: the @ sign has been depreciated for a while. $( 'input[name="conditions_radio"]' )   and you need to qoute the item its looking for
[13:28:04] <deam> djQuery: I noticed, came across an old tutorial..
[13:28:15] <roddy> ah :) he already got it, but i can learn from that, thanks
[13:28:42] <jaequery> anyone know of a place that just have a collection of css snippets? and not just css templates?
[13:29:22] <roddy> i began digging into $().filter() to find out how to avoid erroring on selector ".ui-dialog:after" - it seems though that this is one of the more complicated functions, is that fair to say?
[13:29:23] <djQuery> ?g csstricks.com@jaequery
[13:29:24] <bot-t> jaequery, CSSTRICKS - csstricks | csstricks.com - http://csstricks.com/
[13:30:00] <djQuery> roddy: not familar with :after see ?:after
[13:30:01] <bot-t> roddy, .after() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[13:30:28] <phlp> http://css-tricks.com
[13:30:30] <djQuery> doesnt seem to exist roddy
[13:31:04] <jaequery> took me to a spam site
[13:31:10] <roddy> yeah, it's not a valid selector - i'm running through document.styleSheets[x].cssRules[y].selectorText and doing some stuff, which works in chrome but fails in IE/FF
[13:31:47] <djQuery> jaequery: sorry bout that phplp has the right link http://css-tricks.com/
[13:32:03] <roddy> so mainly i wanted to find out which kind of selectors error like that, so that i can create a small wrapper function that simply drops those selectors
[13:32:09] <roddy> maybe it's just :after, in that case i'm done ;]
[13:33:27] <jaequery> blah it's more a tutorial site
[13:33:39] <jaequery> i wanted to find more like a marketplace of just css snippets
[13:33:41] <djQuery> roddy never mind it does exist http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoelement-after
[13:33:49] <djQuery> just not very supported
[13:34:25] <djQuery> roddy: bet you have the same issue as with before.
[13:34:31] <djQuery> :before rather
[13:34:34] <roddy> probably, i'll test :}
[13:35:06] <roddy> indeed!
[13:35:25] <roddy> luckily i don't need it to work .. i just need it not to error :]
[13:35:26] <djQuery> from the description it is not something you would use as an actual selector in jquery but rather to inject stuff with css
[13:35:33] <roddy> right
[13:36:00] <roddy> i didn't imagine it could be used as a selector, precisely because it is used to inject
[13:36:06] <djQuery> roddy: then create a pseudo selector yourself. and just have it allways return true
[13:37:01] <djQuery> roddy: here is a script where I built a custom pseudo selector http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Sxz7T/
[13:37:21] <roddy> ooh, awesome .. that 'll do!
[13:37:23] <roddy> thanks :}
[13:37:31] <devinrolsen> I got a weird one, I'm using jquery to remove all contents from body, then append an iframe to body and point the iframe src to the current page. When I do this though the iframe wont load... is there nothing you can do to load an iframe of the current page?
[13:39:13] <balr0g> ngharo, so, i cant see what is the solution for this... im updated to Chrome 12
[13:39:37] <djQuery> devinrolsen: so you have a perfectly happy page that you remove everything from add an evil iframe and then point the page to load the iframe?
[13:39:51] <devinrolsen> yup
[13:39:56] <devinrolsen> for good reasons though.
[13:40:10] <ngharo> balr0g: you cant xhr to file:/// in chrome without the --allow-blagblah-from-files cmd line argument (the correct cmd line is found in the link i pasted you)
[13:40:15] <devinrolsen> http://www.devinrolsen.com/cssmunch/
[13:40:17] <djQuery> $(document.body).load(url)
[13:42:13] <djQuery> devinrolsen: ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[13:43:01] <devinrolsen> this little app is going to be a bookmarklet that parses your sites style sheets and gives you a report of un-used selectors. But in a bookmarklet version, while being on the home page of a site and trying to run the script, the iframe frame fails cause its trying to load the home page, while being on the home page..
[13:44:30] <balr0g> ngharo, yes, i already launched Chrome using chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files but it dowsnt work, why?
[13:45:21] <ngharo> balr0g: no idea.  maybe ask in #chromium
[13:48:16] <devinrolsen> djQuery, Im using this right now $frame.prop('src', 'http://' + $(location).prop('host')).load(...); and everything seems to work if indeed $(location).prop('host') is not = to the current page (home page to be exact).
[13:48:33] <jaequery> is $.browser really going to be deprecated?
[13:49:37] <systemfault> The doc mentions it may be removed.
[13:49:59] <systemfault> Anyway, it's bad.
[13:50:05] <jaequery> i wish they'd leave it
[13:50:10] <systemfault> Why?
[13:50:18] <jaequery> because i'm using it :)
[13:50:18] <systemfault> Use feature detection.. not browser.
[13:51:15] <jaequery> i tried that but didn't work
[13:51:26] <jaequery> i wanted to detect if browser supports CORS
[13:51:41] <jaequery> i am on jq 4.2, is that why?
[13:52:37] <systemfault> What's that?
[13:53:18] <jaequery> jquery 4.2
[13:53:33] <systemfault> I mean, CORS
[13:53:35] <systemfault> :/
[13:56:15] <systemfault> Hmm.. Seems unusable, that's why I never heard of it.
[13:56:25] <jaequery> Continuously Operating Reference Station
[13:56:49] <systemfault> I was prefering Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.. :/
[13:57:15] <jaequery> so it's unusable?
[13:57:43] <systemfault> Well, yeah if you care about most people.
[13:57:56] <systemfault> Since it seems to be IE8 and later. :/
[13:58:32] <systemfault> And for IE8, there's a notice that it works partially :/
[13:58:49] <systemfault> Personally, I'd still go with jsonp :/
[13:59:16] <systemfault> But I guess that CORS supports POST/PUT/DELETE and all.
[14:00:01] <jaequery> yes
[14:01:17] <glen1> is there a hasClass() equilivent for an radio input name
[14:02:55] <roddy> glen1  you can do something like $( el ).filter( 'input[type=radio]' ).length > 0
[14:03:28] <glen1> thanks roddy, is there also a way to get the name="" from the radio input?
[14:04:10] <glen1> roddy, oh its $(this).name
[14:04:19] <roddy> not sure how to combine 2 things, you could repeat filter -> $( el ).filter( 'input[type=radio]' ).filter( '[name=choice1]' ).length > 0
[14:04:39] <roddy> oh, misinterpreted that :}
[14:05:42] <jaequery> why john resig never hear
[14:05:48] <jaequery> here*
[14:05:57] <phlp> glen1: $(this).attr('name')
[14:06:23] <glen1> thanks phlp thats the one
[14:06:30] <glen1> jaequery, working? lol
[14:06:48] <jaequery> and why is john resig's username, jresig, and not jquery
[14:06:56] <poppiez> hi guys, anyone experiencing problems with firefox 4 and the jquery ajax form plugin? my JSON response is not parsed correctly in firefox 4 when sending Content-Type: application/json. only works if I send text/plain. anyone familiar with this? works in all other browsers
[14:07:26] <glen1> jaequery, do the people who made google call themselves google1, google2 lol
[14:07:37] <phlp> roddy: fyi you can append more attribute selectors on like 'input[type="radio"][name="choice1"]'
[14:07:49] <jaequery> exactly my point
[14:08:48] <roddy> yet more learnage! thanks :}
[14:08:50] <bobbobbins> hey, im building a plugin with potentially a whole lot of methods...and i'm thinking since different people will be adding to the methods, i'd like them in separate .js files...how do i do that?
[14:09:54] <bobbobbins> or is that not a good way to do things?
[14:12:30] <djQuery> bobbobbins: hmmm a plugin with plugins?
[14:13:15] <djQuery> if the plugin is a use plugin to your plugin maybe having it in a seperate file. but having everything "core" to your plugin would be prefered.
[14:13:26] <djQuery> I know jqgrid does this kinda thing
[14:14:36] <djQuery> bobbobbins: I realy like how the ui.widget factory allows for this to be handled easily
[14:14:48] <djQuery> especialy once 1.9 comes out
[14:16:23] <ccmonster> any help would be appreciated : the LI's dont see to appendTo the UL#custom_engines  --- http://pastie.org/2034488
[14:17:01] <d4rklit3> im trying to put text next to my input box ..   selectAll = $("<input/>", {type : "checkbox", value : "select_all", text: "Select All"});      ... but it doesn't show up
[14:17:05] <d4rklit3> do i need to do something different
[14:18:03] <ccmonster> selectAll.val('my value') i think
[14:18:12] <phlp> d4rklit3: use a label
[14:18:16] <d4rklit3> aah
[14:18:40] <ccmonster> oh next to it. woops, misread, and yes, use a label and make sure you add the for attribute
[14:19:07] <d4rklit3> ?
[14:19:10] <djQuery> ccmonster: have you seen this syntax for building elms on the fly.  $('<a></a>', {href: "http://www.google.com/cse?cref=" + $(this).text() +"&q=", text: this.title})
[14:19:21] <d4rklit3> selectAll = $("<input/>", {type : "checkbox", value : "select_all", label: "Select All"});
[14:19:21] <d4rklit3> ?
[14:19:29] <d4rklit3> that doesn't seem to work
[14:19:38] <colin3440> what is the best way to include a new .js file after the page has loaded?
[14:19:40] <ccmonster> huh djQuery ...?
[14:19:43] <phlp> label is a separate element
[14:19:56] <bobbobbins> djQuery: well its several widgets, but they're all bundled...im a pretty bad js programmer, so im trying to figure out the easiest and right way to do it
[14:19:57] <djQuery> d4rklit3: well an input doesnt have a label
[14:20:14] <d4rklit3> yeah
[14:20:17] <d4rklit3> checkbox just has text
[14:20:37] <ccmonster> ,text:'My Checkbox Text'
[14:20:45] <djQuery> d4rklit3: didnt even think it had that
[14:20:57] <d4rklit3> well u can add text to it when you write it out
[14:21:01] <ccmonster> yea, djQuery , i know that syntax.
[14:21:12] <ccmonster> no clue why I didnt do it that way.
[14:21:27] <djQuery> ccmonster: when properly formated makes it a lot easier to read in my opinion
[14:21:29] <crowemi> I'm running $.get passing 25 variables to PHP script which works fine, when I load the variables from a DB the $.get crashes the browser... does anyone know why this would be happening. The error I get from Chromes is jquery.js:58
[14:21:36] <ccmonster> I can see that
[14:22:13] <ccmonster> well programmatically, do you know what Im doing wrong? Why it isn't attaching to the UL?
[14:22:46] <djQuery> ccmonster: I typicaly do $('<li></li>').append($('<a></a>')).appendTo(cseContainer) anyway
[14:22:50] <ccmonster> when i log stuff out, it looks all kosher, so im a little confused
[14:23:02] <ccmonster> ahh that could would.
[14:23:31] <crowemi> I'm running $.get passing 25 variables to PHP script which works fine, when I load the variables from a DB the $.get crashes the browser... does anyone know why this would be happening. The error I get from Chromes is jquery.js:58
[14:23:39] <ccmonster> will the $('<li></li>').append($('<a/>')) put it inside the LI?
[14:23:55] <colin3440> ccmonster: yes
[14:23:57] <roddy> crowemi: if that jquery.js is minimized, a line number won't help much; if not, we'd need to know which version of jquery it is to get an idea what chrome is referring to. Perhaps better is to get a descriptive error message, for example from Firefox's error console
[14:24:06] <colin3440> ccmonster: oh wait nvm i have no idea
[14:24:13] <ccmonster> ok, for some reason i was thinking i needed to prepend in my pasties case
[14:24:25] <djQuery> ccmonster: AHHHH the li is not being appended to the ul becuase you have not added the ul to the document yet. so the '#custom_engines') select doesnt find it
[14:24:32] <roddy> crowemi: btw i'm just a guy, not a dev ;]
[14:24:52] <ccmonster> umm..line 11?
[14:24:53] <colin3440> there are so few female developers...
[14:25:01] <ccmonster> oh if only there were more :0
[14:25:09] <crowemi> True
[14:25:24] <swiggy> i have to elements with the same ID - i can easily change this, but i was wondering if it possible to have a selector that only selects that ID, but that is in a parent elemeents id? (ie: <div id="donot"><a id="selectthis">donotselect</a></div><div id="please"><a id="selectthis">select this</a></div>)
[14:25:33] <crowemi> roddy: I'll grab that
[14:25:41] <swiggy> i tried #('#please>#selectthis')
[14:25:43] <swiggy> but it didnt work
[14:25:49] <ccmonster> how can they hae the same ID? ID's only occur once in a dom
[14:25:52] <djQuery> now if you did cseContainer.find('#custom_engines').append(custom) that would work
[14:26:16] <ccmonster> whats wrong with Line 11 then djQuery ? I thought I was creating the Element there?
[14:26:27] <swiggy> because inside a form
[14:26:32] <swiggy> and i haev 2 selectboxs
[14:26:41] <crowemi> Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"  location: "JS frame :: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 7328"  data: no]
[14:26:44] <ccmonster> pastie example please?
[14:26:50] <djQuery> you are but #custom_engines has not been added to the dom yet so it wont find it
[14:26:50] <swiggy> but i will jut give it a diff id i was just wondering if its possible
[14:27:03] <ccmonster> hmm. ok
[14:27:09] <crowemi> any thoughts?
[14:27:22] <ccmonster> so what is the proper way to set it up given my example then?
[14:27:52] <djQuery> and at the top create a var $this = $(this) and get rid of all the $(this)s that you have and replace them with $this
[14:28:03] <ccmonster> ahh, i need to give it a local variable ... i got ya.
[14:28:20] <ccmonster> whats wrong with the $(this) as oppose to $this?
[14:28:49] <phlp> and declare custom
[14:29:02] <swiggy> ccmonster,
[14:29:04] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/hHHJvBdX
[14:29:04] <roddy> crowemi: hrm, i'm not sure yet.. could you paste the relevant parts of your code + the response on something like pastebin ?
[14:29:10] <djQuery> ccmonster: $(this) creates a new jquery object each time its called. OVERHEAD where var $this = $(this) only does it one time.
[14:29:28] <ccmonster> yea, i realized im referencing it later by the selector, but theres no selector yet as djQuery mentioned, since it's not on the dom
[14:29:32] <ccmonster> drr.
[14:29:37] <ccmonster> i see.
[14:29:41] <crowemi> roddy: yeah, I'll let you know when I have it up
[14:29:45] <ccmonster> Wow. So i need to get into that habit
[14:29:55] <ccmonster> i hate overhead.
[14:30:16] <ccmonster> unless my gf is involed. :)
[14:30:16] <djQuery> ccmonster: also there are times when its not neccessary\slower to use attr versus just this.href for example
[14:30:24] <ccmonster> i see.
[14:31:02] <ccmonster> so general rule is $this = $(this) , then $this.href, or $this.name is faster than the alternative
[14:31:56] <djQuery> no no $this.href would throw an error.
[14:32:44] <djQuery> this.href and $this.attr('href') ar the same thing. of course this.href is gonna be 10* faster as it is native to the browser
[14:33:54] <djQuery> ?down jsfiddle.net
[14:34:01] <bot-t> djQuery, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[14:34:04] <ccmonster> hmm, i didnt realize that
[14:34:12] <crowemi> roddy: http://pastebin.com/u/crowemi
[14:34:21] <djQuery> had a nice article yesterday that comapered them
[14:34:28] <crowemi> roddy: hopefully that is enough code to get a good idea.
[14:34:42] <d4rklit3> when i do .change on an a checkbox how do i get whether its on or off from the evnt
[14:34:54] <roddy> crowemi: should be :p i'll have a gander
[14:35:18] <ccmonster> soee, basically always do a $this = $(this) for performance
[14:35:30] <crowemi> roddy: you're awesome, thanks for taking a look... this has been an annoyance for the past two hours...
[14:35:45] <phlp> d4rklit3: $(this).is(':checked')
[14:35:53] <djQuery> ccmonster: yes
[14:36:12] <ccmonster> then after that, if i want to reference attributes and such, what are you suggesting to do?
[14:36:20] <ccmonster> $this.attr('attr') etc..?
[14:36:33] <ccmonster> i got confused for a second....
[14:36:48] <djQuery> ccmonster: and you need to learn how to use the word var instead of just sticking stuff out there
[14:37:00] <djQuery> in the global
[14:37:08] <d4rklit3> phlp:  thanks
[14:37:35] <roddy> crowemi: quick thought - it seems that the $.get request always expects a JSON object (last argument of the call) - this does produce errors when the response is something else
[14:38:07] <roddy> crowemi: so instead of echoing true in some instances, you could try echo json_encode( array( "boolean"=>"true" ) ) or something like that
[14:38:09] <ccmonster> where did i mention var?
[14:39:28] <crowemi> roddy: Okay.. so its always returning json
[14:40:35] <mateus73> Hi guys .. is it possible to keep a new popup window preminent above the parent window?
[14:40:39] <roddy> crowemi: yep, or alternatively only make $.get expect a json on certain requests, but i guess keeping the protocol on 1 datatype is easier
[14:40:48] <crowemi> roddy: that part was a little clunky, I'm still new to JSON and passing arrays via ajax
[14:42:11] <smallfoot-> the TR have 4 TD, how do I check if the first TD starts with letter 'a' ?
[14:42:14] <roddy> crowemi: makes life so much easier :D 1-to-1 relay of information from php to js ftw!
[14:42:28] <ccmonster> where did i mention var, djQuery ? wasn't sure what I said?
[14:42:36] <crowemi> roddy: True. Its weird because its been working fine like that. For example, in the PHP it will pass the test and echo true without crashing the frist time through, but when I reload the variables using $_COOKIE and DB it crashes
[14:43:30] <djQuery> ccmonster: thats just it you never had var anywhere in your function. meaning that all those vars you create where global vars no local.
[14:43:36] <smallfoot-> anybody know?
[14:43:49] <smallfoot-> if i use :contains it search all td and anywhere
[14:43:59] <roddy> crowemi: that's interestingly confusing
[14:44:02] <smallfoot-> if i use :first-child, how im supposed to use :contains?
[14:44:22] <djQuery> ccmonster function(){   thisisglobal = "test"; var thisislocal = "to the function";     }
[14:44:26] <crowemi> roddy: aka the first time through the form, it records the variables into a DB and then sets a cookie, then the second time through the use has the option to load previous values
[14:46:02] <phlp> smallfoot-: $('tr td:first').text().toLowerCase()[0] == 'a'
[14:46:03] <djQuery> ?101@ccmonster
[14:46:03] <bot-t> ccmonster, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[14:46:34] <smallfoot-> phlp, thanks
[14:47:37] <roddy> crowemi: didn't find any other apparent problems yet, is it still producing errors?
[14:48:13] <djQuery> ccmonster: here take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/yNVsd/1/
[14:48:16] <crowemi> roddy: I'm testing passing true like you suggested
[14:48:56] <crowemi> roddy: yeah, still crashing the browser
[14:49:09] <roddy> crowemi: forgot to mention that you would need to edit the if( data == true ) to if( data['boolean'] == 'true' ), but that wouldn't produce an error
[14:49:15] <smallfoot-> phlp, then how do i apply .css after that, cuz 'a'.css() dont work
[14:49:16] <ccmonster> looking....
[14:50:32] <ccmonster> what you want me to look for?
[14:50:39] <phlp> smallfoot-: var td = $('tr td:first'); if (td.text().toLowerCase()[0] == 'a') { td.css('background','red'); }
[14:50:58] <crowemi> roddy: I did change the if statement in the original file. I'm not testing for bool though, I'm testing for a string "true"
[14:52:10] <d4rklit3> how do i set a checkbox
[14:52:23] <d4rklit3> .val(":checked", true);
[14:52:44] <phlp> .prop('checked', true)
[14:53:59] <d4rklit3> awesome
[14:54:00] <d4rklit3> thanks
[14:54:20] <smallfoot-> phlp, i dont think that will check evrey first TD on every TR
[14:54:26] <roddy> crowemi: there's one other thing that often wrecks JSON 'communication', namely PHP errors & warnings .. maybe excessive debugging is the fastest way to resolve this, i.e. copy the entire $.get call, put it above the normal call, remove the "json" argument (as to avoid jQuery's interpreter crashing the browser), and replace the callback function by simply function( data ) { alert( data ); } so that you can see exactly what is passed
[14:54:35] <roddy> crowemi: or use a packet sniffer ;]
[14:55:30] <jlazaroff> question: does anyone know how i might get the boxes on the right to grow to the left when they're clicked on?  http://jakelazaroff.com/test/
[14:55:32] <smallfoot-> crowemi, you can also use Developer Tools in Chromium
[14:55:34] <djQuery> ccmonster: well theres a ton of changes there but it should work.
[14:56:04] <phlp> smallfoot-: $('tr td:first-child').filter(function() { return $(this).text().toLowerCase()[0] == 'a'; }).css('background','red');
[14:56:31] <crowemi> smallfoot: Developer Tools said error on function jquery.js:58
[14:56:38] <crowemi> roddy: I will try that and see what I get
[14:56:45] <d4rklit3> is it possible to convert an array to a json string w/ jquery. i want to create an array and send it to a php service as a json string via post.
[14:57:14] <ccmonster> yea, i prefer that way of creating elements.
[14:57:20] <ccmonster> habit in doing the other way.
[14:57:48] <ccmonster> you're right that it looks much cleaner.
[14:57:59] <djQuery> notice how I sprinked var around whereever I am actualy creating a var
[14:58:18] <crowemi> roddy: its still crashing, so probably not the JSON
[14:59:22] <crowemi> roddy: Its something with the $.get call, because I've tested it and thats where it crashes
[14:59:28] <crowemi> roddy: let met try one other thing
[15:01:07] <crowemi> roddy: yeah, still crashing even when simply echoing strings
[15:01:24] <roddy> crowemi: json-encoded strings ?
[15:01:27] <ccmonster> i noticed the sprinkling :)
[15:01:54] <crowemi> roddy: no, took the JSON out
[15:01:58] <djQuery> ccmonster: by the way I believe that addClass('cse').addClass('cse_external') could be reduced to addClass('cse cse_external') if you wanted to keep the other formating
[15:02:05] <roddy> crowemi: oh wow :9
[15:02:29] <crowemi> roddy: ha ha ha, hm...
[15:02:51] <roddy> crowemi: .. i'll have to start over ;]
[15:03:10] <ccmonster> yea i figured that when i saw the 'class':'cse cse_external' that you did
[15:03:40] <roddy> crowemi: did FF's error-message change?
[15:04:37] <crowemi> roddy: negative,  <?php   $today = date("Y-m-d");  ?>  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.11/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://
[15:04:45] <crowemi> oppssss
[15:04:48] <crowemi> sorry folks
[15:04:57] <smallfoot-> phlp, what if i wanted both 'a' and 'A' ?
[15:05:14] <ccmonster> btw djQuery , the elements are being created now, but the attributes and properties are not being set...sorta odd. http://pastie.org/2034751
[15:05:48] <crowemi> roddy: I do have an idea what the problem is..
[15:06:08] <phlp> smallfoot-: it should do both. that's why the toLowerCase() is there it converts all the text to lower then only has to check for 'a'
[15:07:22] <roddy> crowemi: then you're 1 idea ahead of me
[15:08:04] <crowemi> roddy: ha ha ha, its not looking good... ha ha ha
[15:08:38] <djQuery> ccmonster: some browsers dont like the $('<div/>') so I always do $('<div></div>') cept when I am workin with a self closing like $('
[15:08:45] <djQuery> input />')
[15:08:55] <ccmonster> i see
[15:08:56] <crowemi> roddy: nope, still crashing...
[15:09:12] <roddy> crowemi: you know what, that line number is in $.get's parameter serialization, i.e. before the request is made
[15:09:13] <djQuery> ccmonster: dont know if thats the issue just somethin I noticed
[15:09:19] <roddy> crowemi: what you've been trying to tell me all along
[15:09:22] <djQuery> which props arent being set?
[15:09:26] <ccmonster> yea, but the number of elements is correct, just all of their properties are blank
[15:09:29] <ccmonster> All of them
[15:09:36] <ccmonster> they are blank <a/> tags
[15:09:40] <ccmonster> and blank li's
[15:09:48] <ccmonster> however, nested properly
[15:09:59] <djQuery> ccmonster: tryit with <a></a> then?
[15:10:11] <ccmonster> i see
[15:10:26] <djQuery> can u put it into a fiddle with some html added to it?
[15:11:04] <roddy> crowemi: of all the JSON object keys in the second argument of the $.get request ,is any also the name of a function?
[15:11:08] <ccmonster> did that
[15:11:22] <ccmonster> this site is using Jquery 1.3.2. Maybe it doesn't like that syntax.
[15:11:33] <djQuery> ccmonster: probably
[15:11:35] <ccmonster> because, the previous syntax i was using, worked
[15:11:38] <ccmonster> i think that's it
[15:11:49] <roddy> crowemi: or value
[15:12:00] <crowemi> roddy: possibly... let me double check, lots of variables/functions
[15:12:01] <djQuery> ccmonster: why so old?
[15:12:09] <ccmonster> do you know if anything breaks between 1.4 and 1.3.2.
[15:12:21] <ccmonster> because the site is old and im forced to update stuff, not re-write it
[15:12:44] <ccmonster> and there is a lot of co-dependant, archaic, inefficient code that works, regardless of how bad or inefficient it is
[15:13:13] <ccmonster> and they are asking me to rewrite only a feature or two, and i dont want to go through the hassle of redeveloping a bunch of intertwined pieces
[15:17:07] <hahuang65> whay slider plugin do you guys use for showing anything (not just images)?
[15:17:31] <Brodingo> ?cycle
[15:17:33] <bot-t> Brodingo, Cycle Plugin | jQuery Plugins - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
[15:17:40] <djQuery> ccmonster: have u tested it with the newest anyways?
[15:18:02] <djQuery> unless they are doing a lotta json theres probably not much that will break
[15:18:22] <dabear> ?love @ bot-t
[15:18:23] <bot-t> bot-t, â™¥ U
[15:18:32] <dabear> aah
[15:18:33] <ccmonster> I have not. I just want to get this feature done. I am overhauling some other pieces later in the month. but they want a quick rollout for this other stuff
[15:18:35] <dabear> how cute
[15:18:51] <ccmonster> once this feature is checked off.
[15:19:06] <ccmonster> i can play with the backwords compatibility of jquery on this site ;0
[15:24:31] <crowemi> roddy: I can't find ait
[15:24:33] <jlazaroff> question: does anyone know how i might get the boxes on the right to grow to the left when they're clicked on?  http://jakelazaroff.com/test/
[15:24:43] <roddy> crowemi: it might be easier to test this the other way around, by changing all keys and values in the $.get request JSON to strings -> { 'arrive' : '' + arriveval, 'arriveother' : '' + arriveotherval, .. (dirty string conversion)
[15:25:23] <JonathanSampson_> Hello, all.
[15:27:04] <crowemi> roddy: that is super dirty... ha ha ha
[15:27:41] <roddy> crowemi: .. yeah, i have this bad habit to insert dirty code for debugging purposes and then forgetting about it .. :D
[15:28:53] <crowemi> roddy: ha ha ha, I just can't figure out why it runs perfect on the first round and fails the second time
[15:30:43] <roddy> crowemi: that's still just weird .. the line in jQuery to which FF referred is "value = jQuery.isFunction( value ) ? value() : value;", so that almost suggests that the second time around one of the values is not a normal string
[15:31:43] <crowemi> roddy: hmm... yeah, its having a problem converting a variable
[15:32:35] <crowemi> roddy: hangon, I'm posting the code for setting the second variables the $_COOKIE
[15:33:32] <roddy> crowemi: .isFunction is a wrapper for $.type, so if you were to put the second argument in a separate variable and then looping through it, alerting/printing the type, you may find out which variable is being a party-pooper.. e.g. $.each( json_request, function( i,x ) { alert( 'key ' + $.type(i)+' ' + i + ', value ' + $.type(x)+' '+ x ); } )
[15:34:54] <crowemi> roddy: I dont think the code every returns from the $.get()
[15:35:42] <emmajane> hey folks :)
[15:36:02] <roddy> crowemi: not sure if you're referring to json_request but i meant before the $.get call is made
[15:36:23] <roddy> crowemi: with json_request i mean the json object that is the second argument in the $.get call
[15:36:35] <emmajane> I'm trying to get a "first word of a heading" changed to a different colour. I thought it would be easy, except there's sometimes an extra nested tag (e.g. <a>). I thought I could stack children().html(), but it's (of course), not working.
[15:36:41] <crowemi> roddy: roger
[15:37:06] <crowemi> roddy: I found the variable... completely random, and lucky
[15:37:23] <roddy> crowemi: \o/!
[15:37:24] <crowemi> roddy: its the height and width variables
[15:37:31] <swiggy> how do i make a form elements disabled?
[15:37:57] <swiggy> i tried $(this) = $('#formid'); $this.attr('disabled',true);
[15:37:58] <roddy> crowemi: i wondered about those, but figured that if they were referred to without an jQuery object, they wouldn't qualify as functions
[15:38:00] <swiggy> but no luck
[15:38:29] <ccmonster> i have an txt  input for search called #txtinput , i have some links that I want to append the text in the search input onto the end of the href, however in the firebug console $('#txtinput').val() gets me the text, but in my code it says "an empty string"
[15:38:31] <ccmonster> what is the deal?
[15:38:49] <crowemi> roddy: I'm filtering them as a string...
[15:38:58] <emmajane> http://pastebin.com/0TZaG5Pu <--- line 5 is where I'm stuck.
[15:39:13] <crowemi> roddy: I don't know, I'll have to run more test.. I still don't know exactly why
[15:39:50] <amid_hasan> why doesnt this work? http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/9QMSp/4/
[15:42:34] <d4rklit3> just to make
[15:42:42] <d4rklit3> ie8 support jquery?
[15:43:01] <wontoner> amid_hasan: Your selector isn't working
[15:43:45] <djQuery> d4rklit3: no but jquery supports 1e8
[15:44:00] <d4rklit3> basically none of shit works in ie
[15:44:05] <d4rklit3> but works fine in ff and chrome
[15:44:19] <d4rklit3> is there firebug for ie?
[15:44:43] <djQuery> yes its called developer tools and is isntalled by default. hit the f12 button
[15:44:53] <wontoner> amid_hasan: I made an update to that code
[15:45:17] <Layke> Firebug !== Developer Tools.
[15:45:31] <Layke> It's godawful. A "net" tab wasn't even supported until version 9
[15:45:44] <d4rklit3> ok well i need to know wtfi s wrong w/ this in ie
[15:45:48] <d4rklit3> so i can hope to fix it
[15:46:07] <Layke> You can't view post data, log objects, do anything you would want.. but it is a start anyway
[15:46:13] <djQuery> amid_hasan: because val only works on inputs and selects basicaly you need $('#time').text()
[15:46:13] <Layke> If you can use firebug lite, then use that
[15:46:39] <d4rklit3> well like
[15:46:43] <d4rklit3> i hae 0 javascript on the page
[15:46:45] <d4rklit3> nothing works
[15:47:13] <djQuery> d4rklit3: then you probably have a javascript error.
[15:47:38] <djQuery> try pasting your code into a jsfiddle then click on the jslint button
[15:47:43] <crowemi> roddy: http://pastebin.com/u/crowemi checkout the placeorder.php
[15:47:58] <crowemi> roddy: that might give you a better understanding
[15:50:15] <crowemi> roddy: If you're looking at it... I just commented out the height and width jquery.val under the "yescookie" function
[15:50:23] <crowemi> roddy: that seemed to help...
[15:51:36] <crowemi> roddy: what a piece of s*$#! so irritating... I think its functional now...
[15:52:28] <roddy> crowemi: can't find jquery.val, but yay
[15:53:34] <crowemi> roddy: roger, I just commented it out on pastebin so you could see it... under this vall $("#yescookie").live("click", function(){
[15:53:37] <roddy> crowemi: but is it the json key or json value that is the problem? keys can easily be forced to be strings, but a global variable not so much
[15:53:43] <balr0g> hello, where top look what ajaxOptions can be setted? i don't know why this seems to putting some /ajax dir to my href: http://pastebin.com/5GA8w75u
[15:54:39] <d4rklit3> wow this is fucked up right here
[15:55:14] <roddy> crowemi: i've run into a lot of problems with json too, seems that nowadays i always write all keys and values as strings.. looks dirtier, but feels more safe
[15:55:17] <crowemi> roddy: I still have no idea what the problem was... it was setting the height and width value based on the values from the DB, I also had a function and set values based on what format the user chooses directly above the $("#height").val(data['NUMBER'];
[15:55:37] <crowemi> roddy: then you break them up on server side?
[15:56:46] <roddy> crowemi: no, i do still use json, it's just a syntactical change - instead of { a : 1 } i write { 'a' : '1' }
[15:56:51] <kojiro> damn, there seems to be a firebug bug where the console just stops printing until you close firebug, close firefox and then reopen both. It's bitten me twice now.
[15:57:03] <roddy> crowemi : with dirty string conversions ;]
[15:58:03] <crowemi> roddy: I see... well thank you for all your help!
[15:58:33] <nguyendh> how can i make a spinning wheel and disable form on submit ?
[15:59:18] <roddy> crowemi: no problem - just wish i could've done it faster than 3/4 of the time you already spent :} godspeed!
[15:59:51] <roddy> crowemi: 'i' -> you, i merely offered suggestions of course ;]
[16:02:11] <Aristata> How can I select a checkbox by value?
[16:04:11] <balr0g> where is the API to look what ajaxOptions can be setted? i don't know why this seems to putting some /ajax dir to my href: http://pastebin.com/5GA8w75u
[16:04:20] <systemfault> $('input[type="checkbox"][value="lulz"]') ?
[16:07:19] <coldhead> balr0g: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js
[16:09:38] <d4rklit3> ok so my stuff works in ie9, but ie8/7 is failsauce
[16:10:04] <d4rklit3> and the errors make NO sense at all..
[16:10:10] <d4rklit3> SCRIPT1028: Expected identifier, string or number       functions.js, line 20 character 29
[16:10:16] <d4rklit3> are you kidding me?
[16:10:50] <coldhead> have you tried linting your js?
[16:10:53] <coldhead> with jshint?
[16:10:59] <d4rklit3> what does that mean
[16:11:11] <coldhead> http://jshint.com/
[16:11:28] <d4rklit3> the js breaks when i do this; , {class: "approve" , html: "Approve" });3
[16:11:32] <d4rklit3> on class
[16:11:37] <d4rklit3> ie8 doesn't like class?
[16:11:41] <coldhead> class is a reserved word
[16:11:45] <systemfault> Heh.
[16:11:50] <d4rklit3> needs to be inquotes
[16:12:03] <coldhead> try jshint, it will catch that for you
[16:12:05] <roddy> d4rklit3: hey, i recognize that error.. often happens when a json object has a trailing comma, i.e. { a : b, }
[16:13:30] <d4rklit3> so even if i do "class" :
[16:13:32] <d4rklit3> still shit
[16:13:37] <jlazaroff> question: is there a way for me to keep an element's right side in place while i'm animating the width?
[16:13:58] <d4rklit3> roddy: i need that comma there because there is more than one property
[16:14:32] <coldhead> jlazaroff: you have to do a custom animate() that increases the width and repositions the element
[16:14:47] <roddy> d4rkl1t3: indeed, seems that IE just displays the same error for anything that breaks it's JSON interpreter
[16:15:07] <d4rklit3> so wtf
[16:15:11] <d4rklit3> lol
[16:15:25] <d4rklit3> i can't use jquery in ie8 because ie8 is not compatible w/ jquery syntax
[16:15:36] <roddy> JSON is outside of jQuery
[16:15:50] <roddy> so if you find a way to make IE take your JSON, jQUery should be ok
[16:16:00] <d4rklit3> what json?
[16:16:09] <d4rklit3> i don't see any other way to write an fucking object
[16:16:20] <d4rklit3> { key : value, next : value}
[16:16:22] <roddy> .. yeah, that's a good point
[16:16:26] <d4rklit3> thats an object
[16:16:29] <d4rklit3> wtf
[16:16:54] <coldhead> d4rklit3: http://www.jsonlint.com/
[16:16:58] <coldhead> does it validate there/
[16:17:01] <coldhead> ?*
[16:17:10] <coldhead> just the json
[16:18:01] <d4rklit3> Parse error on line 1: var currentCat;// ^ Expecting '{', '['
[16:18:02] <d4rklit3> wtf
[16:18:03] <jlazaroff> coldhead: okay, trying that.  thanks :)
[16:18:11] <d4rklit3> no comments?
[16:18:27] <d4rklit3> is that it? i can't have comments in my code for ie?
[16:18:28] <coldhead> it JUST parses json
[16:18:40] <coldhead> the var is not part of JSON
[16:18:49] <d4rklit3> but i need that var
[16:18:49] <d4rklit3> wtf
[16:18:57] <d4rklit3> can i not use global vars
[16:19:10] <coldhead> calm down, babe, it's going to be okay
[16:19:15] <d4rklit3> ok i need to cool it.. there is a reasonable explaination
[16:19:18] <coldhead> can you paste all your code somewhere?
[16:19:32] <kojiro> is there a difference between a global var and a var definition without the word 'var'?
[16:19:44] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/2035062
[16:20:08] <roddy> d4rkl1t3: hrm, no problem here getting IE7 to parse and work with var json = { 'class' : 'meh' }
[16:20:35] <d4rklit3> this is exactly why.. i didn't want to do this shit in the first place; all this cross browser crap. I miss actionscript :(
[16:20:48] <roddy> it does fail with { class : 'meh' } though
[16:21:04] <kojiro> is it a python parser? ;)
[16:21:11] <d4rklit3> i tried 'class'
[16:21:14] <d4rklit3> it still failed
[16:21:38] <coldhead> this validates with jshint var approve = $("<div/>", {"class": "approve", html: "Approve" });
[16:23:56] <d4rklit3> wow gay
[16:23:58] <d4rklit3> gay gay gay gay
[16:24:08] <d4rklit3> had to wrap everything with quotes  > : (
[16:24:18] <d4rklit3> ok well u live you learn
[16:24:56] <coldhead> d4rklit3: if you make sure everything you write validates with jshint you don't generally have problems between browsers
[16:25:00] <coldhead> that's what it's there for :)
[16:25:08] <roddy> d4rkl1t3: cross-browser implementations are a veritable route through hell, and it doesn't seem like it's freezing over just yet
[16:25:17] <gf3> reserved words
[16:25:37] <coldhead> gf3: is html a reserved word?
[16:25:37] <gf3> also reversed words
[16:25:42] <coldhead> not according to jshint
[16:25:59] <d4rklit3> coldhead i'll keep it in mind
[16:26:02] <gf3> coldhead: dunno of the top of my head
[16:26:18] <coldhead> off*
[16:26:22] <gf3> coldhead: most browsers let you do your own thing now
[16:27:01] <gf3> { if: { for: { while: { default: { class: { } } } } } }
[16:27:06] <coldhead> yeah it's my first day using browsers
[16:27:16] <coldhead> argh my eyes
[16:27:20] <gf3> I only have opera
[16:29:50] <gigamonkey> Suppose p is a paragraph in a div with overflow: scroll. If I do x = 0; $(p).prevUntil().each(function (i) { x += $(this).outerHeight(true); }) should x now be the appropriate value to set the div's scrollTop in order to put p at the top of the div?
[16:31:09] <gigamonkey> with outerHeight(true) it scrolls a bit too far. With plain outerHeight() it doesn't scroll far enough.
[16:31:58] <coldhead> gigamonkey: take the average?
[16:32:02] <coldhead> sorry idk
[16:32:41] <roddy> gigamonkey: if p 's relation to the div it's in has a vertical dimension (i.e. margin-top + padding-top + top > 0), is x accounted for?
[16:32:49] <blackboard> Hey guys
[16:32:52] <glen1> just curious whats the best way of collecting user statistics like ip, browser etc. Can this be done with jquery?
[16:33:22] <gigamonkey> roddy: I'm not sure what you mean.
[16:33:39] <blackboard> I am having problems with matching strings
[16:33:40] <gigamonkey> My theory is outerHeight(true) is supposed to include the margin (and thus the padding).
[16:33:44] <blackboard> in if/else statements
[16:34:20] <jlazaroff> coldhead: got it, thanks :)
[16:35:02] <blackboard> For example if(command[1] === 'delete'){ evaluates true if command[1] is add
[16:35:15] <blackboard> but else if(command[1] === 'add') also evaluates true
[16:36:04] <coldhead> can you put up a test case on jsfiddle, blackboard?
[16:36:13] <coldhead> cause that should kinda just work
[16:36:22] <blackboard> coldhead: http://blackboarddev.com/mynt/
[16:36:31] <blackboard> Login is same as last night if you remember
[16:36:35] <coldhead> no just the if/else bit
[16:36:50] <coldhead> guh I WILL DO IT MYSELF
[16:37:03] <kojiro> blackboard: ===?
[16:37:21] <blackboard> lol :P
[16:37:25] <roddy> gigamonkey: does prevUntil include the div p is in?
[16:37:32] <blackboard> Whats wrong with it kojiro?
[16:37:37] <gigamonkey> There's not something goofy about top and bottom margins of consecutive block elements getting coalessed is there?
[16:37:57] <gigamonkey> prevUntil returns siblings of of P so it shouldn't.
[16:38:12] <roddy> gigamonkey: i seem to recall some goofiness concerning IE + margins & paddings, but am unsure as to the details
[16:38:18] <gigamonkey> I'm on Chrome.
[16:38:25] <roddy> ok then
[16:38:33] * roddy ponders
[16:39:00] <kojiro> blackboard: nothing, but you seem to be being excessively strict

[16:39:27] <d4rklit3> so im trying to use serializeArray()
[16:39:28] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/2035133
[16:39:32] <coldhead> it Works For Me
[16:39:57] <d4rklit3> and i know that selector works since i tested it in a $.each statement and its all there, thought i can't serialize it, i get [ ] back from the console
[16:40:30] <roddy> gigamonkey: only thing i can come up with is that if the div p is in has a margin/padding, you should add that to x
[16:40:51] <blackboard> coldhead: Fail, the problem was with my if and else
[16:41:05] <coldhead> case cloased!
[16:41:13] <blackboard> the else used to only be one line so it was fine but i added more lines and there being no { } became a problem :P
[16:41:37] <coldhead> that's why douglas crockford says you should always use {}
[16:41:44] <Sava> hi all
[16:41:58] <d4rklit3> anyone?
[16:42:40] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: array is a reserved word
[16:43:37] <roddy> gigamonkey: perhaps .position() would work? ( http://api.jquery.com/position/ )
[16:44:38] <d4rklit3> ryanneufeld: that doesn't matter
[16:44:40] <d4rklit3> still nothing
[16:45:17] <gigamonkey> roddy: I think I tried that.
[16:45:40] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: you're also using it wrong, you have to use it on a form, not a group of inputs
[16:45:53] <ryanneufeld> ?serializeArray() @ d4rklit3
[16:45:54] <bot-t> d4rklit3, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[16:46:04] <kojiro> Anyone have a neat way to copy the css rules from a document to another document (in same origin) without causing any add'l http?
[16:46:15] <d4rklit3> yah man
[16:46:17] <d4rklit3> thats what im doing
[16:46:21] <d4rklit3> and its not working
[16:46:31] <ryanneufeld> no, that's not what you're doing
[16:46:47] <ryanneufeld> your selector is nput[name='approve_vid']
[16:46:51] <ryanneufeld> not a form
[16:47:11] <d4rklit3> well my checkboxes are not in a form
[16:47:27] <d4rklit3> i suppose i can wrap it in a form
[16:47:50] <d4rklit3> its just that its not a simple form, each "form item" is a div with divs inside it
[16:48:02] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: then you don't have valid html
[16:49:01] <d4rklit3> ok well then i'll need to manually serialize it
[16:49:07] <d4rklit3> how's them apples
[16:49:41] <coldhead> repugnant
[16:50:02] <d4rklit3> i dunno what better way to do it
[16:50:06] <d4rklit3> i just have a checkbox
[16:50:12] <d4rklit3> attached to each of these divs
[16:50:15] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: doesn't bother me at all, do whatever the fuck you want, I just told you what the problem is
[16:50:48] <d4rklit3> so my solution is throw my UX out the window?
[16:50:53] <d4rklit3> so i can use one method
[16:51:28] <ryanneufeld> I don't recall saying that
[16:51:57] <coldhead> you can roll your own serialise if you prefer, if you use jquery's it will assume your form elements are in a form
[16:52:28] <d4rklit3> yeah.. mine aren't a form unless i can wrap a form tag around a bunch of divs
[16:52:36] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: in fact, that's not even close to what i said, you posted a problem, got impatient when no one answered you with in 2mins. I offered you an explanation to why your code wasn't working
[16:52:44] <d4rklit3> ok ok
[16:52:46] <d4rklit3> sorry
[16:52:50] <d4rklit3> lets just relax
[16:52:58] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: divs are perfectly fine in a form
[16:53:02] <coldhead> indeed, i am going to enioy a beerbong in the tub
[16:53:04] <coldhead> brb
[16:53:09] <ryanneufeld> nice
[16:54:08] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: a form is a styleless element, so it has no effect on the layout of your page. you can pop it in without changing the CSS
[16:54:50] <ryanneufeld> ?form
[16:54:51] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Plugins/Validation/Validator/form - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/form
[16:55:03] <ryanneufeld> that was cool, but not what I wanted
[17:07:24] <d4rklit3> so here comes the really dumb question..   when i have this array, can i just toString() and then send that string via post to php that will decode the json to a php array?
[17:13:48] <roddy> d4rkl1t3: not sure about post, but if you use $.get( 'file.php', { somearray : [ 1,2,3,4 ] } ), you should be able to access $_REQUEST['somearray'] and find array( '1','2','3','4' )  in file.php  (since HTML delivers a GET request as a string, you'll get strings instead of numbers)
[17:14:04] <roddy> make that { 'somearray' : [ 1,2,3,4 ] }  :]
[17:29:58] <BenC[UK]> Evening guys, is anyone familiar with Highcharts?
[17:32:42] <ryanneufeld> d4rklit3: no
[17:33:56] <bryandowning> i just did a project with highcharts
[17:34:20] <BenC[UK]> http://jsfiddle.net/xsbWC/2910/
[17:34:23] <BenC[UK]> is what I have at the moment
[17:34:35] <bryandowning> haha wow
[17:34:44] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/lrvick/fH43h/5/ anyone know why value is undefined here ?
[17:35:56] <BenC[UK]> lrvick:  dont use attr, use .val()
[17:35:56] <BenC[UK]> http://jsfiddle.net/fH43h/6/
[17:36:44] <bryandowning> BenC[UK] so what's the problem?
[17:37:29] <BenC[UK]> bryandowning:  well, you see the area series.. I am trying to use them to set a period ... I want them to go top to bottom, I tried setting min: 0, max:1 so that its either all or nothing - but its not working
[17:38:03] <Aristata> if I am finding checkboxes by value, and two checkboxes have the same value, how can i drill down further?
[17:38:20] <Aristata> this isn't working $("input[type='checkbox'][id='resource_center_person_ids_'][value='1']");
[17:39:02] <DannyMac21> If my validation rules aren't running despite an empty form, but the.submitHandler is running, anybody have an idea why this would happen? This is using the Validation plugin on IE.
[17:39:09] <BenC[UK]> ah man, ignor eme, I found it
[17:39:40] <BenC[UK]> Aristata: why would you have two checkboxes with same id and same value?
[17:40:31] <bryandowning> haha
[17:40:50] <bryandowning> i was just formatting the json in that series so i could read it better, but you got it?
[17:41:32] <Aristata> BenC[UK]:  I just realized I can go by id
[17:41:38] <Aristata> and value combined
[17:41:38] <BenC[UK]> yeh
[17:41:50] <Aristata> Checkboxes should never have the same id right?
[17:41:58] <Aristata> or can they if they are part of a collection?
[17:42:09] <bryandowning> no tow elements should have the same id
[17:42:10] <BenC[UK]> bryandowning: yeah, well, almost, I have set the max to 1, but its going to 1.2
[17:42:10] <bryandowning> ever
[17:42:23] <bryandowning> *two
[17:42:29] <Aristata> the programer before me has all these ids the same
[17:42:31] <Aristata> blah
[17:43:09] <bryandowning> BenC[UK] there's totally like a value padding config
[17:43:16] <bryandowning> i remeber seeing that somewhere
[17:43:31] <bryandowning> it like pads tha max value i think
[17:43:47] <Archaic_G> anyone know how to play audio via jquery on a blackberry?
[17:43:53] <newbold> is there a way to make the main script wait for the "complete" function called in ajax() to finish up before proceeding? I've created some kind of awkward timing issue here in that my script depends on data from the complete function but that data isn't ready in time when the rest of it executes :(
[17:44:22] <ryanseddon> ?promises @ newbold
[17:44:25] <bot-t> newbold, #9203 (beforeSend doesnt take into account promises) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9203
[17:44:34] <newbold> woo promises
[17:44:36] <ryanseddon> 0_o thats not what I wanted
[17:44:54] <ryanseddon> but yes look into $.defered
[17:45:31] <newbold> ryanseddon: like http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/ ?
[17:45:41] <BenC[UK]> newbold: why not make the success call back call the rest of the script/
[17:45:51] <newbold> BenC[UK]: oh, now that's interesting
[17:45:58] <newbold> see, it's the simple stuff like that that nails me every time :P
[17:46:39] <xiljin> not sure if this is jQuery specific but perhaps someone has seen this and can point me in the right direction? I've got a table, when tabbing off the last text input a new TR is added via $.get and $('#table').append(data) .. the problem is that after the ajax call, the text in the preexisting inputs is getting reselected entirely or whereever the cursor was when the input was blurred.  This only occurs in Firefox 4 though, picture worth
[17:46:39] <xiljin>  a 1000 words?  http://i.imgur.com/4VlpI.png
[17:46:53] <bryandowning> newbold you could also set the async option to false in your ajax configs - not sure if that's best practice though
[17:47:15] <bryandowning> i can't get the highcharts docs to load
[17:48:28] <ryanseddon> synchronous xhr makes me stabby
[17:48:40] <bryandowning> haha stabby?
[17:48:59] <bryandowning> like you want to stab someone?
[17:49:19] <ryanseddon> it's an expression I don;t really want to stab someone, just don't block my ui if you can avoid it
[17:49:30] <newbold> heh it just hit me that "ajax" isn't very ajaxey if you kill the asynchronous aspect of it
[17:49:36] <newbold> sjax?
[17:50:25] <bryandowning> lol
[17:50:32] <bryandowning> that's basically what you're asking for
[17:50:48] <newbold> yeah :/
[17:51:08] <bryandowning> BenC[UK] found it
[17:51:14] <newbold> I'm too much of a noob to fully understand what I'm doing... I've copied copied and pasted enough stuff to work it out, kind of
[17:51:14] <BenC[UK]> maxPadding
[17:51:16] <bryandowning> maxPadding
[17:51:17] <bryandowning> lol
[17:51:19] <BenC[UK]> but.. its not working
[17:51:19] <BenC[UK]> :)
[17:51:30] <bryandowning> oh bum deal
[17:51:41] <newbold> I found that an alert() in just the right place kills the primary script thread but allows the forked ajax bit to complete
[17:51:55] <newbold> but that's obviously not the solution :P
[17:52:29] <iszak> Morning #jQuery
[17:53:06] <BenC[UK]> bryandowning: http://jsfiddle.net/j32Nr/2920/ is my current progress
[18:00:17] <bryandowning> it's the number of ticks
[18:01:31] <bryandowning> if you set tickInterval to 20 on the first Y axis and 0.1 on the second y axis you'll see what I mean
[18:03:10] <BenC[UK]> it seems it was the first axis
[18:03:25] <BenC[UK]> doesnt look like you can set a maxPadding for each yaxis
[18:04:29] <bryandowning> yeah i think it's getting confused because it's trying to figure out the range across the ticks
[18:04:36] <jdillick> Anyone know if there is there a good alternative method to set "checked", "selected", and "disabled" without using .prop() that won't break in 1.6.1?
[18:04:38] <bryandowning> on both sets of numbers
[18:05:01] <BenC[UK]> but the two sets of numbers are compleletly different scales
[18:05:10] <bryandowning> exactly
[18:05:36] <bryandowning> it can't figure out how to set the breaks on the different scales with the same number of ticks
[18:08:24] <bryandowning> totally got it...i think
[18:09:35] <bryandowning> http://jsfiddle.net/j32Nr/2921/
[18:10:24] <iszak> anyone buying chromebooks?
[18:10:39] <bryandowning> i don't plan on it

[18:11:19] <iszak> they're only $500
[18:11:21] <BenC[UK]> one more thing...
[18:11:25] <bryandowning> so i just set max and min padding on both to 0
[18:11:45] <bryandowning> and specified the tick interval for the secondary
[18:11:52] <ngharo> i'd consider getting one when/if my cr48 dies
[18:11:57] <BenC[UK]> you see how I have "points"
[18:12:07] <bryandowning> lol
[18:12:11] <bryandowning> i see lots of points
[18:12:12] <BenC[UK]> basically, the area chart shows if the room is occupied or not
[18:12:25] <bryandowning> oh right
[18:12:38] <BenC[UK]> blue if its empty, red  if its someone popping in the room, green if they're in there a long time..
[18:12:48] <bryandowning> so you just wait the points gone?
[18:13:02] <BenC[UK]> well, I want the area to be solid colour all along
[18:13:05] <BenC[UK]> if that makes sense
[18:13:32] <bryandowning> oh

[18:32:46] <newbold> when I was 10, I was dialing into local multi-line MajorDomo BBSes with the "teleconference" feature to troll people
[18:33:03] <newbold> but today, I'm a reformed troll. :)
[18:33:15] <newbold> (also known as an ineffective troll, *sigh*)
[18:33:26] <kojiro> "effective trolling"
[18:33:37] <newbold> kojiro: it exists!
[18:33:41] <kojiro> newbold: you mean like Sara Pal... COUGH
[18:33:42] <newbold> I just can't pull it off anymore
[18:33:46] <newbold> kojiro: oh lol
[18:33:54] <newbold> you know, I never thought of that as a form of trolling
[18:34:06] <savetheinternet> It would work better if Freendoe didn't strip the color control characters.
[18:34:10] <savetheinternet> It's supposed to be in blue too.
[18:34:20] <newbold> but to acknowledge it as trolling would mean you'd have to agree that she had the sense to engineer such a troll
[18:34:25] <newbold> which would be giving her way too much credit
[18:34:26] <ngharo> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/9e8P7/ seems to work in chrome
[18:34:29] <newbold> ergo, no troll
[18:34:33] <kojiro> savetheinternet: oh well done sir. I was most amused there for the moment I wasn't thinking about my next milkshake.
[18:34:44] <newbold> mmm milkshake
[18:35:11] <kojiro> newbold: is there such a thing as proxy trolling?
[18:35:21] <kojiro> newbold: like when you set idiots up with an idea so that they troll it for you?
[18:35:29] <newbold> kojiro: oooh, good question
[18:35:34] <newbold> that would be pretty sophisticated
[18:35:54] <ngharo> fox news
[18:36:00] <gf3> nox fews
[18:36:10] <kojiro> ngharo: oh I did lol. I lolled in real life.
[18:36:20] <ngharo> hehe
[18:36:50] <kojiro> so anyway... markitup editor (Jquery plugin) anyone? http://dpaste.com/551770/
[18:37:21] <ngharo> where does it fail?
[18:37:24] <kojiro> that callback *is* being called when I click the preview button, but the styles aren't being applied.
[18:37:56] <kojiro> If I call that very same function in firebug after the iframe is loaded, the styles apply.
[18:38:06] <coldhead> ack, gigamonkey was peter seibel!
[18:38:14] <kojiro> so I assume there's something out of sync
[18:38:18] <coldhead> https://gist.github.com/1013608
[18:38:40] <BoulderDave> im using jquery.form.js and jquery 1.5.2 and im getting $(options.target).attr("innerHTML", data).evalScripts is not a function on line 214 of jquery.form.js   ($(options.target).attr("innerHTML", data).evalScripts().each(oldSuccess, arguments);)       any ideas what this could be?
[18:38:55] <BoulderDave> (jquery form 1.0.3
[18:39:47] <BoulderDave> n/m got it.
[18:39:50] <BoulderDave> that jquery was very old
[18:41:29] <Whirl3d> what url can I use to add jqueryUI to jsfiddle?
[18:41:33] <kojiro> lol, that is a head without a dom
[18:41:47] <kojiro> I wonder why javascript didn't just throw an error
[18:45:25] <Whirl3d> anybody? jqueryUI, jsFiddle? it used to have the jquery UI check box.
[18:46:58] <kojiro> Whirl3d: maybe you're supposed to add the resource manually? :/
[18:47:02] <ngharo> Whirl3d: select jq 1.5.2 from jsfiddle
[18:53:15] <Whirl3d> kojiro, I tried using google's cdn, wouldn't work. Is jquery 1.6 supposed to return the "px" in css values? I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why $(something).width()+$(something).css("border-top-width") wouldn't work.
[18:53:34] <Whirl3d> ngharo, thx, I'll try it
[18:55:27] <kojiro> Should I expect $("iframe#foo").contents().ready(function() {}) to work as a way of attaching an onload event to a child iframe?
[18:56:21] <iszak> kojiro, no you should not expect it to work.
[18:56:55] <iszak> ?contents @ kojiro
[18:56:56] <bot-t> kojiro, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[18:57:09] <iszak> you'd apply it to the iframe, no the children
[18:57:15] <kojiro> oh duh
[18:57:19] <kojiro> iszak: thanks
[19:00:40] <fourcolors> hey all, im trying to create a styled button that will click a hidden file field and I created some code that looks like this http://pastie.org/2035509
[19:00:50] <fourcolors> now it doesn't upload the image
[19:00:53] <fourcolors> i mean
[19:01:00] <fourcolors> open the field_field dialog
[19:01:12] <fourcolors> am i going about this right?
[19:14:55] <fourcolors> hey is there a way to grab the file name from a file_file if you haven't yet uploaded but have select a file?
[19:17:32] <roddy> fourcolors : i believe it's simply the input elements' value
[19:17:47] <fourcolors> oh right thanks roddy
[19:18:12] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: some browsers have the files property on which will have a FileList object wheere you can grab info about a file, but this is only in certain browsers
[19:22:59] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: ok cool thanks. Is there a way to check to see if a file_field is done being used? basically I want to update a div tag after a user selects a file
[19:23:51] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: attach teh change event
[19:23:55] <ryanseddon> the*
[19:24:12] <fourcolors> oh change right didn't know that existed
[19:24:13] <fourcolors> thanks
[19:27:37] <electissimi> I need someone who has played with flot before to help me fix something
[19:28:00] <electissimi> The error I am getting is: "Invalid dimensions for plot, width = null, height = null"
[19:28:09] <fourcolors> is there a place I can reference things that can be used in .live() ?
[19:28:21] <fourcolors> like "click" and "change" etc ?
[19:28:36] <coldhead> sounds like the width and height are null
[19:28:43] <coldhead> can you paste the code somewhere, electissimi?
[19:28:56] <electissimi> yes
[19:29:27] <electissimi> http://pastebin.com/XPj3cZk1
[19:30:08] <electissimi> it's supposed to get the width and height automatically from the <div>
[19:30:28] <coldhead> can you paste all your code?
[19:30:33] <coldhead> i can't see what placeholder is
[19:30:38] <electissimi> the file would be huge
[19:30:54] <electissimi> it's jquery.flot.js
[19:30:55] <coldhead> oh well i'll just use my imagination then
[19:32:05] <electissimi> this is what i'm using to call it
[19:32:07] <electissimi> http://pastebin.com/tVSwLhPy
[19:32:12] <coldhead> thank you :)
[19:32:30] <coldhead> does the placeholder element have a css width and height specified?
[19:32:36] <coldhead> they do in the examples on the flot site
[19:32:50] <electissimi> <div id="donut" class="graph" style="width:600px;height:300px">
[19:33:01] <coldhead> that really looks right doesn't it
[19:33:02] <coldhead> >: \
[19:33:36] <diamonds> ack
[19:33:38] <electissimi> i've even tried just manually setting those variables...caused more errors
[19:33:57] <diamonds> I'm trying to check if a form (validated with jquery validate) is valid
[19:34:07] <diamonds> but only the fields are marked
[19:34:18] <coldhead> which browser is it breaking in, electissimi ?
[19:34:39] <electissimi> coldhead: chrome
[19:34:56] <electissimi> coldhead: and firefox, just checked it
[19:34:57] <coldhead> >: \
[19:35:46] <electissimi> it seems like placeholder.Width(); isn't grabbing it
[19:35:49] <coldhead> electissimi: try $('#donut').width() at the chrome console
[19:36:08] <diamonds> http://pastebin.com/2EtuwD00
[19:36:12] <coldhead> or jQuery('#donut').width()
[19:36:21] <electissimi> returns 600
[19:36:31] <coldhead> HMM
[19:36:32] <diamonds> how can I check for an error class on an input then return false up to ajaxForm?
[19:37:45] <coldhead> electissimi: what about you add console.log($('#donut').width()) just before you call flot
[19:38:00] <coldhead> and see if it's correct there
[19:38:44] <electissimi> coldhead:how would i do that?
[19:39:19] <electissimi> paste that into the console and check a log somewhere?
[19:39:53] <electissimi> coldhead: it returns 600 then undefined if just pasted in the console
[19:40:38] <fourcolors> i have some radio buttons and I would like to toggle an event when one of them is clicked and I have something that looks like this. http://pastie.org/2035615
[19:40:44] <fourcolors> this doesn't sime to work
[19:40:48] <fourcolors> seem*
[19:41:17] <keyo> Anyone know flot? I'm having problems with time series axis ticks
[19:41:57] <electissimi> lol i'm having issues with flot as well
[19:42:03] <electissimi> pie chart though
[19:43:12] <Whirl3d> Same class maybe?
[19:43:23] <Whirl3d> <-troll
[19:44:15] <coldhead> electissimi: http://pastebin.com/hSKVJi32
[19:44:18] <coldhead> i mean like that
[19:44:23] <coldhead> alert() or console.log()
[19:44:34] <coldhead> did it show 600 there?
[19:45:19] <electissimi> coldhead: returns null
[19:45:21] <electissimi> hmm
[19:45:38] <electissimi> maybe i have to put it after the <div?
[19:45:41] <coldhead> electissimi: are you calling flot inside a $(document).ready() wrapper?
[19:45:51] <electissimi> coldhead: yes
[19:45:57] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: what exactly are you trying to do?
[19:46:05] <coldhead> it sounds like the element doesn't exist yet
[19:46:22] <coldhead> and ready() should fix that
[19:46:35] <coldhead> but try moving the JS to the very bottom of the page
[19:46:43] <coldhead> and even maybe use setTimeout
[19:48:25] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: I have three radio buttons. Users may submit a post. A post can have a question, link or photo. they can only submit one at a time. I would like for every time they select a radio button that the appropriate field appear and the other fields dissapear
[19:48:33] <electissimi> coldhead: hmm it seems to work now
[19:48:36] <electissimi> that's odd though
[19:48:51] <coldhead> .ready() really should have been enough
[19:48:56] <electissimi> yeah
[19:49:05] <coldhead> anyway, onward and upward
[19:49:08] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: so I'm making div takes appear and disappear
[19:49:09] <electissimi> maybe something is interfering with it?
[19:49:45] <coldhead> keyo: can you pastebin your code and describe your problem?
[19:54:48] <keyo> coldhead: Lol, I just had xaxis{mode:"time"} in the series instead of the chart options.
[19:55:06] <coldhead> good work :)
[19:55:29] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: you could do something like this http://pastie.org/2035653
[19:55:40] <keyo> coldhead: do you know if it's possible to have axis labels beside the ticks? Like 'time' on the bottom
[19:55:56] <keyo> can't find that in the docs, but it has labelWidth, but I think this is for ticks
[19:56:34] <coldhead> keyo: i have just done that with html/css in the past
[19:56:58] <coldhead> then later a little cunt co-worker has redone the whole thing with some other graph library for some reason
[19:57:04] <coldhead> not that i;'m bitter
[19:57:10] <coldhead> but i swear i will kill him
[19:57:12] <keyo> coldhead: ahhaha
[19:57:29] <keyo> well this is a legacy php application. we all hate it
[19:57:47] <coldhead> it is ever thus
[19:59:07] <keyo> apart from the ugly text file docs, flot has been exactly what I wanted
[19:59:10] <runa> heyas. I'm looking for a plugin to display an overlay when an element is clicked. and I need it to a) start in the position where the clicked element is b) be dnd (so the user can move it out of the way). any hints?
[19:59:24] <coldhead> yes flot has been good to me
[19:59:29] <coldhead> and i like the oldschool docs
[19:59:44] <coldhead> it's quaint
[19:59:50] <keyo> they are good, they just need to be put on github or something in markdown format, much nicer to read
[20:00:08] <coldhead> runa: you can build that from jQuery UI components
[20:00:15] <coldhead> i'm not aware of an existing plugin
[20:00:52] <runa> coldhead: tnx!
[20:03:23] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: thanks.. um.. that doesn't seem to be working. no events are being made
[20:04:24] <Fernandos> hi
[20:04:47] <Fernandos> how can I work with elements that get inserted with the live() function into the dom?
[20:05:12] <Fernandos> because jqueryui.sortable doesn't recognize them..
[20:07:39] <coldhead> Fernandos: you probably need to re-sortable() them when you add them
[20:07:51] <coldhead> or there might be a way to add elements in the sortable() docs
[20:08:22] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: seems to be working for me? http://jsfiddle.net/ZdAWp/1/
[20:09:16] <Fernandos> coldhead: ahh and I thought that's a method that I will never need :D
[20:09:31] <Fernandos> you mean this I think .sortable( "refreshPositions" )
[20:09:35] <Fernandos> gonna try
[20:09:53] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: I wonder if this ryanfiat checkbox js thing is breaking it http://ryanfait.com/resources/custom-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons/
[20:10:01] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: ill post what my html looks like
[20:11:01] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: you don't need js to do custom checkboxes, well only for ie8 and down
[20:11:11] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: http://pastie.org/2035705
[20:11:31] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: really? oh I didn't know this. How can I do that. Should I be asking the css channel?
[20:12:17] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: http://www.thecssninja.com/css/custom-inputs-using-css </shameless self promotion>
[20:13:15] <fourcolors> fantastic ill read and implement. Im going to disable that other javascript and give your example a go however uno momento
[20:13:36] <Fernandos> k.. got it working by putting the sortable inside the live method.. that's suboptimal.. but works
[20:14:06] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: yup, works like a charm. Guess that other javascript was bad. Ok ill read your amazing article.
[20:15:43] <xcaliber> hi
[20:16:05] <xcaliber> can someone help me out with some basic jquery UI? I'm just trying to get a simple button to work.
[20:16:10] <xcaliber> look at: http://cloudclass.snsdcentral.net/test.html
[20:16:39] <Fernandos> coldhead: you damn genius ;)
[20:21:55] <xcaliber> can anybody help?
[20:22:46] <ryanseddon> xcaliber: it says there is no method button() in the error console
[20:22:54] <xcaliber> hmm...
[20:23:05] <xcaliber> but this is like a very basic scriptâ€¦ i don't understand why not
[20:25:48] <Fernandos> xcaliber: you should have jquery first then jqueryui..
[20:26:15] <Fernandos> and you have jquery twice
[20:26:15] <xcaliber> that isn't the problem.
[20:26:28] <xcaliber> it works now.. but i dont know why
[20:26:31] <xcaliber> i just copied and pasted something
[20:27:13] <xcaliber> if you take a look at the source nowâ€¦ it seems as if nothing changed right? but it works??
[20:27:24] <Fernandos> you remove the 2nd jquery call
[20:27:29] <Fernandos> I mean include
[20:28:47] <xcaliber> what do you mean?
[20:30:21] <Fernandos> xcaliber: it cannot work if you include jquery twice :)
[20:30:27] <xcaliber> ooh
[20:30:50] <xcaliber> i thought that jquery ui was diff from the other jquery haha
[20:31:58] <Archaic_G> anyone know how to play audio via jquery on a blackberry?
[20:32:48] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: your a good writer
[20:33:18] <ryanseddon> fourcolors: thanks!
[20:33:23] <Fernandos> xcaliber: jquery.ui is just a collection of ui widgets and jquery is just a javascript library that helps easies working with javascript.
[20:33:54] <xcaliber> right, but did i include jquery twice?
[20:34:11] <Fernandos> you had, but you removed one instance of it :)
[20:34:14] <xcaliber> does the jquery-ui download include the jquery framework?
[20:34:19] <xcaliber> ooh see that was where my confusion was
[20:34:42] <xcaliber> i didn't know that i didn't have to download the regular jquery if i downloaded jquery ui
[20:34:51] <xcaliber> meaning i didn't know the jquery ui pack included jquery :P
[20:35:27] <Fernandos> jqueryui comes with an old version of jquery, but they do so to guarantee functionality even though newer versions of jquery would work with jqueryui it's just a way to ensure quality.
[20:36:39] <xcaliber> ahh i see i see
[20:36:43] <Fernandos> there is the "possibility" that something new introduced in a newer jquery version wouldn't work with jqueryui..
[20:38:10] <xcaliber> haha wow
[20:38:22] <xcaliber> i should include the newer jquery then right?
[20:39:51] <Fernandos> xcaliber: yes you can. I'd check this out, it's a good read: https://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals
[20:40:47] <xcaliber> what am i supposed to be reading?
[20:41:07] <TheoMurpse> I've noticed that .change() is triggered on a dropdown when the mouse is used to change the dropdown to another value, but not when the keyboard is used. HOw can I trigger the change when the keyboard is used to change the value (i.e., using tab and up/down to navigate between form elements)
[20:43:32] <Fernandos> xcaliber: it's up to you :) it's some jquery fundamentals they teach over there.. here is the online version: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[20:44:23] <xcaliber> thanks! :D i appreciate it
[20:44:30] <xcaliber> do you use AIM by any chance :P
[20:45:08] <Fernandos> no
[20:45:15] <xcaliber> heh k
[20:45:30] <Fernandos> but I'm here quite often
[20:46:41] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: I just finished reading your article and I think it was a little bit above my head
[20:47:31] <fourcolors> ryanseddon: are you saying the basic concept for styling a radio button is to put an image over the button itself and make the real radio button disappear?
[20:48:26] <ryanseddon> just invisible, it's still there just has opacity set to 0;
[20:50:52] <fourcolors> i see ok ill give that a go
[20:56:58] <amid_hasan> Why isn't this localStorage page view counter working?? http://jsfiddle.net/tRLCF/
[20:58:41] <xcaliber> try something like $("#displayLoadedCount").html("stuff");
[20:59:37] <amid_hasan> working now: http://jsfiddle.net/tRLCF/3/
[20:59:51] <amid_hasan> thanks xcaliber. also messed up quoations in the div
[20:59:55] <amid_hasan> :P
[21:00:06] <xcaliber> np :P
[21:00:07] <amid_hasan> do you know of any mobile uses of localStorage?
[21:00:14] <amid_hasan> what can it be used for
[21:00:54] <Fernandos> amid_hasan: storing json responses in it..
[21:01:08] <ewproctor> What is the effect that I'm looking for, I want to have a list of 8 items, and when you click on each item, a single area gets changed.  Is it just a fade?
[21:01:20] <amid_hasan> yes
[21:05:07] <amid_hasan> Fernandos: do you have sample code how I would store a response? I am new to localStorage
[21:05:14] <amid_hasan> how do you parse it
[21:06:16] <amid_hasan> also, localStorage is key:value only, right?
[21:08:53] <RyanD|Home> dwarder yo
[21:09:22] <djQuery> amid_hasan: heres a good into http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/quick-tip-learning-about-html5-local-storage/
[21:11:26] <amid_hasan> djQuery: thanks!
[21:11:48] <amid_hasan> oh, i actually did that tut before
[21:11:48] <amid_hasan> haha
[21:11:54] <djQuery> amid_hasan: after watchin it for a bit its not as good as I thought
[21:12:05] <amid_hasan> i need to simulate iPhone like behaviour
[21:13:09] <djQuery> amid_hasan: never used one before so I wouldnt know
[21:13:22] <amid_hasan> Let's say I make an app that store values, like addresses. Would I use localStorage or webDB?>
[21:13:44] <djQuery> think webdb has fewer supported browsers
[21:13:52] <amid_hasan> I am limited to HTML5/js/jquery/css for my implementatoin
[21:14:18] <djQuery> ur allready gonna lose all the ie7 > losers with localstorage
[21:14:29] <djQuery> err users
[21:14:36] <djQuery> no I had it right the first time
[21:14:50] <amid_hasan> let me create a fiddle, and tell me if this would work based on my constraints
[21:15:38] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[21:16:41] <djQuery> gott learn canvas

[21:27:12] <djQuery> $('#sbt').click(function(){Â alert($('#pharmacy').val());});
[21:27:54] <djQuery> amid_hasan: worked for me u just had incorrect qoutes u had "#sbt'  instead of 'sbt'
[21:28:25] <djQuery> amid_hasan: you prob want a $('#sbt').click(function(e){Â e.preventDefault();Â alert($('#pharmacy').val());});
[21:28:35] <djQuery> amid_hasan: see ?preventdefault
[21:28:35] <bot-t> amid_hasan, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/

[21:36:17] <djQuery> use a cdn
[21:36:26] <wkmanire> oh wait, I misread that.
[21:36:31] <Rahly> you can host jquery yourself if you wish
[21:36:32] <djQuery> jquery has thier own cdn but I prefer the google one
[21:36:51] <babonk> djQuery: any reason?
[21:37:40] <wkmanire> Wow, I tried to correct myself and gave another window focus on accident. Then I closed my pidgin IRC window trying to give it focus again.
[21:37:43] <djQuery> babonk: seems like thats what most are using so they most likely allready have it cached
[21:37:49] * wkmanire is doing it wrong.
[21:38:00] <RyanD|Home> heh.
[21:38:08] <RyanD|Home> I had a lot of moments like that @ work today.
[21:38:14] <djQuery> babonk: think google sets the cache on it to 1 year as well
[21:38:20] <RyanD|Home> Coworker's mac has a scroll-button mouse (I'm used to the magic mouse)
[21:38:30] <amid_hasan> I want to extract the telephone number from a #detail div formatted as (415) 123-4567. How do I select this using jQuery?
[21:38:32] <RyanD|Home> and he's got his damned scroll button bound onclick to hide all windows.\
[21:38:41] <wkmanire> nice
[21:38:48] <amid_hasan> regex?
[21:38:49] <RyanD|Home> I'm REALLY curious what the use for that is, also, the world's most sensitive scroll button to clicking.
[21:38:53] <RyanD|Home> EVERYTHING disappears constantly.
[21:39:11] <RyanD|Home> which was really annoying, since I was writing a bunch of code isnide of a CMS, which was tedious enough as it was without UI quirks.
[21:39:45] <djQuery> amid_hasan: dont think jquery has anything other than getting the text of the div for you. after that its regex   var txt = $('#detail').text(); see ?.text
[21:39:46] <bot-t> amid_hasan, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[21:40:31] <amid_hasan> Because the phone number inside the #div is not wrapped inside a #telephone div how do I match it only?
[21:40:33] <djQuery> RyanD|Home: thats so he can hide the porn quickly
[21:40:53] <amid_hasan> ALT+F4 to hide porn quickly
[21:41:03] <amid_hasan> of FN+F4
[21:41:07] <amid_hasan> to go to sleep
[21:41:08] <wkmanire> Why hide it?
[21:41:09] <amid_hasan> lol
[21:41:14] <amid_hasan> from your mom
[21:41:17] <amid_hasan> or wife
[21:41:20] <coldhead> because you are ashamed
[21:41:42] <amid_hasan> no one wants to see you jerking off
[21:41:43] <djQuery> but he prob has one hand on mouse and one errr "occupided" so mouse would be faster
[21:41:59] <coldhead> ew ew ew ew ew
[21:42:02] <amid_hasan> lol
[21:42:17] <Rahly> lubing up the mouse?
[21:42:19] <amid_hasan> please change the topic, i am getting horny
[21:42:30] <wkmanire> What happen?
[21:42:51] <djQuery> got any canvas examples out there
[21:42:52] <wkmanire> coldhead: And you thought it was strange when ajpiano and I were talking about hockey.
[21:43:03] <amid_hasan> :P how do I match #detail div div div div.text('(213) 123-2131');??
[21:43:20] <Rahly> canvas is kinda fun
[21:43:28] <Rahly> i wish it was more like svg though
[21:43:30] <amid_hasan> djQuery: watch the Google IO talk about html5. helpful
[21:43:32] <RyanD|Home> amid_hasan what?
[21:43:35] <Rahly> or they made svg faster
[21:43:38] <RyanD|Home> amid_hasan also, link.
[21:43:43] <amid_hasan> ok

[21:44:16] <RyanD|Home> I was trying to go to bed soon too.
[21:44:19] <amid_hasan> I am trying to extract the phone number off a Walgreens store locator
[21:44:26] <amid_hasan> (because they dont have an api)
[21:44:33] <Rahly> lol
[21:44:43] <Rahly> i ripped all the zip codes out of the usps
[21:44:57] <Rahly> takes a few hours to run the script
[21:45:10] <amid_hasan> Rahly: give me give me please...
[21:45:18] <Rahly> give you what?
[21:45:21] <djQuery> so am i gonna need to redo it to have the tables actualy in the canvas? I was thinking about just having the canvas have a z-index of 1 and the tables having a z-index of 2.
[21:45:22] <amid_hasan> i need zip code/city references
[21:45:41] <djQuery> then drawing the connections between the tables on the canvas
[21:46:24] <amid_hasan> anyone, how do you match the phone number using jQuery?
[21:46:33] <amid_hasan> i.e. (123) 123-1234 format
[21:46:49] <djQuery> gues I could do it all in plain html by using divs with only borders on the top or right and just placing them correctly
[21:46:52] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: you need regular expressions
[21:46:55] <amid_hasan> and once match of format is made, extract the .text() value of the inside of the div
[21:48:33] <Rahly> http://dl748.dyndns.org:8080/zipcodes.csv
[21:48:44] <djQuery> amid_hasan: here is the pattern you need /^\(?(\d{3})\)?[-Â ]?(\d{3})[-Â ]?(\d{4})$/;Â 
[21:48:55] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: /\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}\-\d{4}/ <-- thats a crude one that will match the format you had (123) 123-1234
[21:49:22] <ryanseddon> amid_hasan: djQuery has a better one don't listen to me
[21:49:26] <amid_hasan> ryanseddon, djQuery: thanks!!
[21:49:32] <Rahly> i usually strip all non alphanumeric characters before parsing
[21:49:34] <keyo> so I scroll up and see all this talk about wacking it off :p
[21:49:44] <amid_hasan> keyo: haha
[21:49:59] <Rahly> did you get that amid?

[21:52:04] <amid_hasan> Rahly: wow, that's only 2 megs
[21:52:13] <Rahly> yup
[21:52:22] <Rahly> if you limit it to only P's, its a lot smaller
[21:52:40] <djQuery> amid_hasan: well u are not doing any kinda match.
[21:52:41] <amid_hasan>  How did you scrape this, if you don't mind me asking?

[21:55:04] <Rahly> yeah, 80344 zipcodes, if you take only P's its 42000
[21:55:20] <Rahly> rukubites: should
[21:55:24] <amid_hasan> djQuery: i need to match the pattern in order to get the number
[21:55:27] <amid_hasan> as i'm scraping
[21:55:44] <rukubites> Rahly: Thanks. Was a bit confused since jqueryui packages 1.5.1

[22:01:25] <amid_hasan> could i easily create a php script that scrapes the entire page, matches the phone number, and returns result original page requesting the phone number in json format?

[22:01:42] <Rahly> probably
[22:01:43] <amid_hasan> i dont know java
[22:01:50] <ryanneufeld> amid_hasan: yes, you could do it in PHP
[22:02:02] <ryanneufeld> "easily" depends on how well you know php
[22:02:03] <Rahly> you'd wanna store it in a db, so that you don't have to do realtime scraping though
[22:02:11] <ryanneufeld> ^^^ what he said
[22:02:11] <amid_hasan> I can scrape the site easy
[22:02:34] <Rahly> the zipcodes were pretty easy
[22:02:41] <amid_hasan> However, this will require some reverse parameter manipulation in the url to query by zip, city etc from walgreens' own site

[22:06:35] * ryanneufeld might regret this
[22:10:29] <amid_hasan> Does CORS work?
[22:10:51] <djQuery> amid_hasan: the site ur accessing has to allow it I think
[22:11:28] <amid_hasan> How do you allow a connection not of the same domain server side?
[22:11:42] <Rahly> you don't
[22:11:51] <Rahly> its a security feature
[22:12:00] <ryanseddon> set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[22:12:17] <ryanseddon> you can pass the wildcard ( not recommended) or a comma seperated list of domains
[22:12:21] <Rahly> i don't think thats works in all browsers
[22:12:27] <amid_hasan> The security feature is preventing me from calling a script from a mobile application which doesnt live on the same domain as the server script
[22:12:30] * amid_hasan blah
[22:12:39] <ryanseddon> IE8 and up and all other stable release browsers support it
[22:12:51] <amid_hasan> any of you heard of google jsonp allowing cross-domain calls?

[22:23:07] <littulb> i just know its something VERY simple

[22:30:36] <littulb> Can anyone tell me why im getting "undefined" when the checkboxes are checked????  http://jsfiddle.net/littulb/tq9ma/
[22:31:22] <ryanseddon> littulb: because this is the global object
[22:32:04] <ryanseddon> you need to do $(this).attr("id") in the change callback
[22:32:42] <littulb> You are absolutely right!!!!!!!!!! Thanks bro!
[22:33:04] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[22:34:52] <devinrolsen_> hey, I got another weird issue. If you go here in IE8/9 http://tinyurl.com/3hzngcl , the style sheet select box is only display the first letter of any option. Anyone ever see this before?
[22:35:06] <devinrolsen_> displaying*
[22:36:45] <bobbobbins> im using $.getJSON to pull in some data, but it has that callback function, and i wanted to have the data usable in my main function, how can i do that?
[22:37:14] <bobbobbins> is it just var data = $.getJSON?
[22:40:57] <bobbobbins> well no, that didn't work
[22:41:48] <coldhead> no, it runs in the background
[22:41:59] <coldhead> you have to do it in the callback
[22:42:35] <coldhead> if you need to access it outside the callback you can have the callback set a global variable
[22:42:45] <sorens3n> i would use a CPS style
[22:42:48] <coldhead> but the rest of the program has to poll for the variable to be set
[22:42:48] <sorens3n> and call forward
[22:42:56] <coldhead> so it's easier to do it in the callback
[22:43:02] <sorens3n> make continuation functions
[22:43:13] <coldhead> or use a Child Pornography System, as sorens3n suggests
[22:43:29] <coldhead> oops, wrong window
[22:43:43] <m0dmd> hey what's going on everyone
[22:43:48] <devinrolsen_> o0

[22:44:04] <Jakey> lol
[22:44:07] <sorens3n> let me know when you become a programmer ;)
[22:44:09] <Jakey> bad day sorens3n?
[22:44:10] <coldhead> sorry sorens3n
[22:44:16] <sorens3n> a bit.
[22:44:23] <abjorn> I look at #jquery for the first time in hours and I see the words "use a child pornography system"
[22:44:28] <abjorn> sounds about right.

[22:45:24] <abjorn> nah, had a job interview at HostGator today
[22:45:29] <abjorn> couldn't wiggle or waggle
[22:45:30] <m0dmd> How'd that go?
[22:45:40] <Ownatik> Hi, I've read that As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set. Before jQuery 1.6, what did it return?
[22:45:41] <abjorn> pretty good, I think I'm gonna get the job
[22:45:43] <coldhead> hey good luck with that, abjorn
[22:45:47] <abjorn> I know that shit left and right
[22:45:49] <m0dmd> Nice man.
[22:45:57] <m0dmd> What's the position?
[22:46:04] <coldhead> they're meant to be good employers
[22:46:08] <abjorn> oh, well, except I didn't remember what port IMAP uses so I didn't answer that question right rofl
[22:46:33] <abjorn> but it's not like they care about that
[22:46:36] <coldhead> and of course in a real life situation there's no way you could look up the port :(
[22:46:40] <abjorn> m0dmd: customer support
[22:46:53] <abjorn> coldhead: I know, how would I manage to do such a thing?
[22:47:08] <coldhead> DOOMED!
[22:47:32] <abjorn> It's not in the encyclopedia, so how could I look it up? If only there were an online encyclopedia...with more information...that anyone can edit...it would have stuff about port numbers and anything you could think of!....if only
[22:47:38] <m0dmd> Hahah
[22:47:55] <abjorn> can't look up port numbers, better drink my own piss
[22:48:19] <abjorn> I think RaceCondition timed out from IRC because of a Race Condition.

[22:56:31] <m0dmd> It increments :(
[22:57:07] <m0dmd> the focus() will run +1 everytime you close and open the form

[22:59:52] * coldhead wiggles
[23:00:48] <m0dmd> coldhead just copy/paste run firebug. Open the form > click the input fieldOne -> close form > open Form again > and watch the focus run +1
[23:01:51] <m0dmd> Ownatik backwards compatibility you could use native javascript :p
[23:02:27] <m0dmd> can you make sure your site works in IE5 please.
[23:02:38] <coldhead> i don't unnerstand, m0dmd
[23:02:52] <coldhead> why are you binding to focus every time you click?
[23:02:58] <coldhead> shouldn't that happen just once?
[23:03:05] <m0dmd> Exactly it should just happen once
[23:03:09] <m0dmd> Check out the version that works.
[23:03:12] <m0dmd> That removes the form.
[23:03:23] <coldhead> also why aren't these on jsfiddle where i can actually use them?
[23:03:31] <m0dmd> It works perfectly, but I would like to just hide/show my form instead of remove/show
[23:03:34] <coldhead> they both work fine in my imagination
[23:03:42] <m0dmd> Because you need to use firebug
[23:03:50] <coldhead> i can use firebug on jsfiddle
[23:03:52] <m0dmd> I don't know how to use firebug with jsfiddle :)
[23:03:54] <coldhead> not in my imagination
[23:03:56] <Ownatik> m0dmd, I used a library today which was not working with 1.6+. I had to fix this issue with the title attribute. I'd like to commit a fix to it so it works with both 1.5.2 ans 1.6. I don't think that's a silly idea.
[23:03:57] <m0dmd> OH alright kool let me add them
[23:04:33] <coldhead> Ownatik: attr() behaved slightly differently in jQUery 1.6 to previous versions
[23:04:39] <coldhead> and it's fixed in 1.6.1
[23:05:14] <Ownatik> I know, but $.attr("title") returns undefined in 1.6.1 too
[23:05:25] <Ownatik> while it returns an empty string in other version
[23:05:29] <Ownatik> how should I deal wth this
[23:05:32] <coldhead> i am unfamiliar with that method
[23:05:38] <coldhead> what is that the title of?
[23:05:48] <coldhead> $('foo').attr('title') is happy
[23:05:50] <Ownatik> well anything
[23:05:52] <Ownatik> why should it matter
[23:06:02] <coldhead> $.attr() is not very jQuery looking
[23:06:18] <Ownatik> I know .... this is for an example
[23:06:18] <hrwath> it's a title of a dot
[23:06:22] <m0dmd> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/C9BKG/2/
[23:06:25] <Ownatik> $("#yo").attr("title")
[23:06:27] <Ownatik> better?
[23:06:39] <coldhead> yes, that should give you the title in 1.6.1
[23:06:43] <Ownatik> it does
[23:06:44] <coldhead> thank you for clarifying
[23:06:47] <Ownatik> but if the title is not set
[23:06:59] <Ownatik> it returns undefined
[23:07:11] <Ownatik> while it returns empty string in lower versions
[23:07:18] <Ownatik> I need to check if it's set
[23:07:19] <m0dmd> So test for both
[23:07:36] <m0dmd> if( $("#yo").attr("title") == 'undefined' || $("#yo").attr("title") == )
[23:07:39] <m0dmd> if( $("#yo").attr("title") == 'undefined' || $("#yo").attr("title") == '' )
[23:07:57] <Ownatik> m0dmd thank you, my question was if there was any better solution
[23:08:03] <m0dmd> would be nice to add:$('#yo')
[23:08:16] <coldhead> m0dmd: i'm still pretty sure you shouldn't bind focus() every time
[23:08:27] <coldhead> but you can fix it with unbind like http://jsfiddle.net/C9BKG/3/
[23:08:56] <coldhead> Ownatik: gimme a sec to do you a kind of cheeky fix
[23:09:09] <m0dmd> coldhead thanx bud.
[23:09:34] <m0dmd> coldhead am I coding it wrong then
[23:09:58] <coldhead> m0dmd: i would bind the focus handler outside the click handler
[23:10:06] <coldhead> so it doesn't bind it again every click
[23:10:12] <coldhead> but maybe you have your strange reasons
[23:10:52] <m0dmd> Gotcha done
[23:11:06] <m0dmd> Yea, I just assumed that it needed to be within the click that shows the form
[23:11:19] <m0dmd> But thanx man. I just put it outside and it's working fine
[23:11:23] <m0dmd> Thanx man
[23:11:26] <m0dmd> u da mang
[23:11:44] <coldhead> you're welcome!
[23:12:45] <balr0g> hello, can anybody help with this kind of issue: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/getjson-character-encoding ?? i have JSON with utf8 chars, when rendered shows strange chars, please help
[23:15:44] <Hilton> Hello. First off, I know just enough jQuery and JS to be dangerous. Which isn't much. :) I have a form with a set of repeating fields. All id="size_3_width", etc. They are contained within a div of a similar id. I also have a hidden div which contains an empty set of these fields.
[23:16:56] <Hilton> What is the best/easiest way to duplicate that hidden div, change the ID, and change the IDs of all the contained elements?
[23:17:06] <Ownatik> Hilton First, never put 2 elements with the same ID.
[23:17:19] <Hilton> ...who said anything has the same ID?
[23:17:29] <Ownatik> They are contained within a div of a similar id
[23:17:36] <Hilton> similar, not same.
[23:17:40] <Ownatik> k good =)
[23:17:53] <Hilton> <div id="size_2"><input id="size_2_width"...><input id="size_2_height"...>etc
[23:19:39] <coldhead> Ownatik: http://jsfiddle.net/bTNRT/
[23:20:08] <poppiez> hi guys, anyone experiencing problems with firefox 4 and the jquery ajax form plugin? my JSON response is not parsed correctly (it asks me if I want to save the response as a javascript source file) in firefox 4 when sending Content-Type: application/json. only works if I send text/plain. works in all other browsers
[23:20:35] <Hilton> So far I have this:   $('#size_divToCopy').clone().attr('id', 'size_'+num)... but I need to change the IDs of the tags within said DIV (perhaps by replacing a temporary identifyer like ** with the number?)
[23:21:22] <Ownatik> coldhead thanks, taking a look.
[23:22:33] <m0dmd> coldhead do you worry about image preloading?
[23:22:42] <m0dmd> for small applications.
[23:22:53] <coldhead> only if the client complains
[23:22:59] <m0dmd> alright, no need :)
[23:23:13] <coldhead> and even then "worry" is probably too strong a word for it
[23:23:43] <mipo> how to select by name?
[23:23:51] <mipo> $(name)?
[23:23:52] <babonk1> Which autocomplete library should I use?  UI autocomplete?
[23:23:53] <mipo> how?
[23:24:01] <thinkfast> hey all, just wondering why im getting ReferenceError: Can't find variable: showMyVideos when using this code http://pastebin.com/CPLaUmVH
[23:24:02] <coldhead> $('a[name="some name"]')
[23:24:06] <JKarsrud> $([name=""])
[23:24:21] <thinkfast> if i just put an alert in the function it works fine, so it must be something else inside thats triggering the error
[23:24:36] <mipo> coldhead , JKarsrud : thanks
[23:24:40] <mipo> hi
[23:24:42] <Ownatik> coldhead: yup, duc punching seems to be the best solution ...
[23:24:45] <Ownatik> duck*
[23:24:51] <Ownatik> thank you
[23:24:58] <coldhead> no worries!
[23:25:42] <thinkfast> also it seems to only happen in safari
[23:25:52] <thinkfast> and on android
[23:25:56] <thinkfast> firefox works fine
[23:26:30] <coldhead> that's very annoying, thinkfast
[23:26:41] <coldhead> it looks fine to me
[23:26:46] <thinkfast> yeah me too
[23:28:43] <JKarsrud> hmm, the indenting is fooling me :P
[23:28:47] <coldhead> thinkfast: i doubt it would work but what about declaring the function with window.showMyVideos = function () {... etc
[23:29:33] <JKarsrud> coldhead++
[23:30:09] <JKarsrud> even though when declared like that, it should already be window.showMyVideos..
[23:30:11] <JKarsrud> I guess
[23:30:17] <coldhead> exactly
[23:30:28] <coldhead> but i don't know for sure that safari and android work properly
[23:30:44] <coldhead> but then again i can't get a plumber to visit
[23:30:51] <coldhead> i should shutup
[23:31:21] <JKarsrud> Nope, so maybe a closure and an explicit window.functionName = function() could do the trick
[23:31:27] <JKarsrud> I need to start working :P
[23:32:08] <JKarsrud> *goes to scrum board*
[23:35:39] <thinkfast> what a time to get disconnected haha, did anyone manage to see what the problem was with that code?
[23:37:01] <JKarsrud> thinkfast: http://pastie.org/2036231
[23:37:07] <JKarsrud> just to sum things up =)
[23:37:18] <thinkfast> ooo :D
[23:39:31] <JKarsrud> lol
[23:39:32] <thinkfast> what do you mean by closure sorry?
[23:40:26] <JKarsrud> I really meant an iffy (IIFE): (function() {â€¦.})();
[23:40:40] <JKarsrud> ?iffy
[23:40:44] <bot-t> JKarsrud, slight issue | jQuery Plugins - Something I noticed about this plug-in is if you hold down a key and then click the mouse and get the focus onto another textbox, it does not clear up unwanted characters and seems to break the rul... http://plugins.jquery.com/content/slight-issue
[23:40:47] <JKarsrud> ?iife
[23:40:48] <bot-t> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[23:41:31] <JKarsrud> lol, I love it when I think there's a bug in my JS, when all it was was some stupid labels that were connected to the wrong inputs :P
[23:42:39] <Fretta> I have a check box but i want to place an image on top of the checkbox if checked, would this be a jquery solution?
[23:42:51] <JKarsrud> Fretta: yes
[23:42:54] <JKarsrud> and an easy one at that
[23:43:09] <Fretta> JKarsrud what is it called?
[23:43:12] <JKarsrud> just look for :checked
[23:43:27] <JKarsrud> ?checked
[23:43:28] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[23:43:48] <Fretta> JKarsrud thnx will look now
[23:43:50] <JKarsrud> :)
[23:45:29] <coldhead> thinkfast: i doubt it would work but what about declaring the function with window.showMyVideos = function () {... etc
[23:46:21] <thinkfast> yeah im trying that now
[23:46:47] <thinkfast> nope
[23:46:52] <thinkfast> see i dont think this is the problem
[23:46:59] <thinkfast> because when i just put alert('hi'); inside the function
[23:47:01] <thinkfast> it triggers with no error
[23:47:12] <coldhead> woah
[23:47:21] <thinkfast> its something inside the function throwing a false error
[23:48:21] <JKarsrud> thinkfast: try doing bits and pieces of it then?
[23:48:32] <JKarsrud> like
[23:48:40] <JKarsrud> inserting code until it fails
[23:48:59] <thinkfast> yeah good idea
[23:49:20] <JKarsrud> oh wait
[23:49:23] <coldhead> JKarsrud++
[23:49:47] <JKarsrud> are you sure you can set the value of default?
[23:51:01] <JKarsrud> never mind, my IDE is having the fritz because it doesn't know what the object contains
[23:51:06] <JKarsrud> it seems
[23:51:57] <JKarsrud> http://gyazo.com/ff2d88027d8d8b2c568d837f04fe924b :)
[23:52:26] <krz> anyone using uploadify?
[23:53:44] <coldhead> i have used it, krz
[23:53:47] <thinkfast> do you think that could be the problem?
[23:53:49] <coldhead> never again though
[23:53:56] <krz> why so?
[23:53:57] <thinkfast> google using default as a bloody key
[23:54:04] <thinkfast> hmm
[23:54:08] <JKarsrud> maybe, but I kinda doubt it tho
[23:54:42] <coldhead> krz: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[23:54:53] <coldhead> that's less trouble
[23:55:16] <JKarsrud> thinkfast: might be why my IDE is complaining, but I don't know if that is why it fails
[23:55:29] <JKarsrud> but safari might have problems with it too :/
[23:56:36] <krz> coldhead: can that script send scriptData like uploadify does?
[23:57:06] <coldhead> i don't know i'm sorry, having to send scriptData was one of the things i hated about uploadify
[23:57:10] <coldhead> :(
[23:57:28] <krz> using uploadify to upload directly to s3
[23:57:30] <krz> works so far
[23:57:40] <coldhead> oh wow
[23:58:10] <krz> was just asking, because i had a different problem with it. but fixed it suddenly
[23:58:28] <coldhead> through the power of my despair, perhaps
[23:59:43] <JKarsrud> coldhead: what do you think about thinkfasts error being that google uses default as a key on the object?
