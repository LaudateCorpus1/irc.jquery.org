[14:06:47] <ckb> hey guys I'm using bootstrap's dropdown-menu and dropdown-item but even an anchor tag won't bubble up to the document.
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> ;) have a fiddle or something?
[14:07:20] <ckb> robertmaxrees, you do this to me everytime
[14:07:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> not trying to be a jerk - without seeing what you're doing, I can only make assumptions about what your html and js look like.
[14:08:36] <robertmaxrees> and those assumptions may in fact be wrong.
[14:10:04] <ckb> no I know. just proprietary info in here that I'd have to redact and it's troublesome
[14:10:06] <ckb> one sec
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking for a test case tho.
[14:10:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the actual code.
[14:13:51] <ckb> robertmaxrees, phone numbers, etc. I think I figured it out
[14:14:24] <robertmaxrees> right.  just a reduced test case :)
[14:14:53] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out though.
