[00:00:11] <popof_> Shazer[2]: im just saying its completely irrelevant
[00:00:17] <popof_> Shazer[2]: just google jquery slidehow
[00:00:19] <popof_> Shazer[2]: or something
[00:00:24] <popof_> if you dont want to make yoru own
[00:01:08] <Shazer[2]> It's for school, so I probably can't use another one.,
[00:01:15] <Shazer[2]> I want my web app to be flashy lol, not plain.
[00:01:18] <Shazer[2]> That's why I thought of this.
[00:01:35] <popof_> Shazer[2]: im not sure if you have a question
[00:02:19] <Shazer[2]> Well, I'm not sure how to do it..
[00:02:23] <Shazer[2]> Maybe I should just do something simpler.
[00:12:22] <rymate1234> ohi
[00:13:10] <rymate1234> trying to use ajax with jquery to make myself a web interface for mpd
[00:20:11] <rymate1234> For some reason though, the data isn't been sent to mediaControls.php, meaning nothing happens. My code is on gist - https://gist.github.com/4577261
[00:21:16] <rymate1234> .....does help if you actually download jquery.js
[00:25:23] <versatiletech> rymate1234: you need to use $(document).ready() and you might have you move line 19 all the way below line 168 since the jquery library might be loaded before you actually assign the click event
[00:25:43] <versatiletech> library might not be loaded*
[00:25:49] <rymate1234> ah
[00:28:35] <rymate1234> does $(document).ready() just get put into the end of my <script> tag?
[00:31:44] <rymate1234> great. now my mediaControls.php isn't working
[00:31:45] <rymate1234> -.-
[00:44:28] <ChrisBolton> I'm usingTwitter Bootstrap to style some items in a list. I'm also using a remote form to append in some items from the list. Any way to apply the same ss stylings t the current branches
[00:44:29] <ChrisBolton> ?
[00:45:51] <ChrisBolton>  Any way to apply the same stylings to the appending rows  that is?
[01:00:05] <angryasian> give all those rows a class? a css rule that applies to thet list would work too.
[01:04:19] <popof_> can I use .children() but only act on all but first child?
[01:06:30] <grafi> children(':gt(0)') should do the trick, i think
[01:07:37] <angryasian> I'm lazy I'd probably do $($('blah').children()[0]).stuff();
[01:10:16] <angryasian> Truth be told, when it comes to dealing with speficic children, I usually use regular javascript and not much jquery. Unless I feel that making the program go through a .each() loop can't do much harm.
[01:12:26] <grafi> $($('blah').children()[0]).stuff(); would just be the first child though wouldnt it?
[01:16:59] <angryasian> yes, isn't that what he wanted?
[01:18:14] <popof_> angryasian: all but :P
[01:18:22] <popof_> I used splice(1)
[01:18:23] <popof_> thank gus
[01:18:25] <popof_> guys
[01:18:57] <angryasian> oh, lol. Oops! Yeah its an array, do what you want with it. :)
[01:22:10] <popof_> :)
[01:28:34] <grafi> so its more of a slice/splice then ;)
[01:55:23] <Whiskey> Are it anyway to fix tables/td/tr in jQuery for Internet Explorer 6/7 so it work correct?

[02:32:10] <AlexC_> Morning
[02:33:04] <AlexC_> Using jQuery 1.9.0 (from Googles CDN), in MSIE8 I am getting "'jquery' is undefined" warning - however everything works just fine as expected. If I switch back to jQuery 1.8 the warning goes away. Anyone else experiencing this?
[02:37:10] <AlexC_> Seems to be coming from "//@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map"
[02:38:47] <brownfox> SOS: why I can't access the jquery website?
[02:39:06] <brownfox> SOS. I can't access the jquery website.
[02:39:41] <brownfox> It seems that my ip address is not allowed to access the site.
[02:42:37] <angryasian> restart your modem / try a new dns server?
[02:48:33] <AlexC_> fwiw, I've reported the bug as http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13274
[03:14:27] <Hapzz> i have a <div><a></a><span></span></div>
[03:14:37] <Hapzz> how do i traverse from a .click on the <a> to the <span>?
[03:14:45] <Hapzz> .siblings() didn't work

[03:15:21] <Hapzz> neither does .closest()
[03:24:16] <AlexC_> Hapzz: Take a look at the docs for .next()
[03:28:09] <Hapzz> thanks.
[03:28:51] <rymate1234> I have an issue with getting a jquery click handler to work. When I click on the button with the id "previous-track" (line 62), my javascript should execute. However, it isn't, and I don't even see my test alert? What am I doing wrong? D:
[03:29:02] <rymate1234> Code is at http://pastebin.com/Ryijib1W
[03:30:31] <[jmc]> rymate1234, instead of $(document).ready(...); you could just use $(...);
[03:30:53] <[jmc]> and maybe try $(element).on('click', function () {}); instead of $(element).click(...);
[03:31:25] <BinaryKitten> [jmc] there's not that much difference between .click(fn) and .on('click', fn)
[03:31:45] <rymate1234> .click(fn) is cleaner
[03:32:04] <BinaryKitten> "cleaner", depends on your definition
[03:32:13] <[jmc]> BinaryKitten, yeah but worth trying :D (and, isn't jquery deprecating .click handlers and just using .on in the future? or maybe my memory fails me)
[03:32:38] <BinaryKitten> [jmc] nah
[03:32:44] <[jmc]> ok
[03:32:51] <BinaryKitten> [jmc] it's bind, live and delegate that are deprecated
[03:33:06] * [jmc] takes note
[03:33:16] <[jmc]> thanks for clearing this up for me
[03:33:19] <BinaryKitten> np
[03:33:42] <BinaryKitten> internally .click proxies through to .on if you pass a fn
[03:33:46] <rymate1234> nope, makes no different
[03:33:52] <BinaryKitten> or it calls triggger if not
[03:35:27] <rymate1234> so instead of $(document).ready(...);
[03:35:38] <rymate1234> I use     $( ... );
[03:35:40] <rymate1234> ?
[03:35:46] <[jmc]> it should be the same, afaik
[03:36:21] <rymate1234> well, neither worked :(
[03:36:28] <rymate1234> This is fustrating ¨_¨
[03:36:52] <[jmc]> wait, use jsfiddle
[03:37:28] <rymate1234> uhh
[03:37:30] <rymate1234> l
[03:37:31] <rymate1234> k
[03:41:03] <AL3> $('div.drop').on({ 		'dragover': function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, 		'drop': function(e) { 			 			e.preventDefault(); 		}
[03:41:32] <rymate1234> it might be a while getting it onto jsfiddle
[03:41:51] <grafi> have you checked jquery is actually working rymate1234?
[03:41:55] <AL3> is there any way, I can find out the element's full path that was dropped in div.drop
[03:42:27] <rymate1234> how would I do that?
[03:43:16] <AL3> $('div.drop').on({ 'dragover': function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, 'drop': function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }
[03:43:21] <AL3> is there any way, I can find out the element's full path that was dropped in div.drop
[03:43:49] <grafi> open up devtools/firebug/inspector and try selecting an element oon the page with jquery
[03:45:05] <rymate1234> uh
[03:45:47] <rymate1234> well, I put an alert("test"); in my document ready bit
[03:45:51] <rymate1234> and it didn't work
[03:46:15] <grafi> that seems  to indicate that jquery isnt working properly
[03:50:01] <AL3> $('div.drop').on({ 'dragover': function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, 'drop': function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }
[03:50:01] <AL3> is there any way, I can find out the element's full path that was dropped in div.drop

[04:50:07] <angelazou> hi, I have created a nice jquery drag and drop quiz, it works great on laptops but not so on mobile and tablets
[04:50:31] <angelazou> I am not sure jquery mobile support drag and drop
[04:50:38] <angelazou> so what other alternatives do I have?
[04:57:42] <Hattara-pilvi> How do I get the pure content string from "$.get(file.txt):"?
[04:58:11] <corehook> hi all
[04:58:22] <corehook> why $.get(..,function()) dont call my callback ?
[04:58:56] <corehook> http://arbee-design.co.uk/static/jqchat/jqchat.js
[04:59:02] <corehook> callServer function
[04:59:13] <corehook> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.3.2
[05:17:08] <GoSox> how does one do a non-async post?
[05:23:30] <shoky> ?async
[05:23:32] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user‚Äôs ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[05:36:55] <corehook> ?get
[05:36:57] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[05:37:04] <cusco> ?load
[05:37:05] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[05:37:05] <b-ot> cusco, like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[05:37:21] <corehook> ?getJSON
[05:37:22] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:37:39] <cusco> ?ajax
[05:37:39] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:39:27] <GoSox> so I have a javascript that spits out an error, and then the form submits and the page is redirected, so the error console is cleared and I can't see the error
[05:40:29] <corehook> fuck jquery
[05:40:31] <corehook> fuck javascript
[05:40:35] <corehook> lame langauges :(
[05:40:46] <shoky> GoSox: there's usually an option to preserve logs upon navigation
[05:40:50] <GoSox> you may be right, but there is no alternative
[05:40:50] <cusco> js says fuck you too
[05:40:57] <shoky> GoSox: in chrome its in right-click on console
[05:41:23] <cusco> GoSox: stop the redirect or alert()
[05:41:50] <GoSox> cusco: i'm trying to stop the redirect, but theres an error in my js code that stops js and lets the form go ahead and submit
[05:41:59] <GoSox> so the error goes away so fast
[05:42:09] <cusco> alert() the error
[05:42:13] <GoSox> how?
[05:42:14] <corehook> cusco u js runner ?
[05:42:24] <cusco> corehook: my browser is
[05:42:26] <corehook> or runner :)
[05:42:40] <corehook> secretary*
[05:42:47] <corehook> so
[05:42:56] <corehook> WHY getJSON never call callback function ?
[05:43:00] <GoSox> nevermind ill just do this in chrome
[05:43:04] <cusco> GoSox: alert will sto the browser redirection untli you click ok, perhaps you can see the error in console that way?
[05:43:04] <corehook> on demo server it work correctly
[05:43:08] <cusco> ok
[05:43:10] <shoky> corehook add an error handler
[05:43:13] <GoSox> SAFARI 6's dev tools are SO TERRIBLE.
[05:43:18] <shoky> also use newer jquery :\
[05:43:26] <cusco> corehook: ... what are you trying to acomplish?
[05:43:28] <corehook> last ?
[05:43:33] <cusco> corehook: can we see some code?

[05:56:40] <corehook> syntax troubles?
[05:56:49] <corehook> on callServer ?

[06:04:04] <DansVC> hi
[06:04:18] <DansVC> hi
[06:04:31] <DansVC> someone?
[06:05:05] <shoky> anyone?
[06:06:27] <DansVC> how I can rexize the height with a div?
[06:07:04] <GoSox> how can I select a tag "span"? I have $(this).parent()  - and I want to tack on a 'span' at the end of that, so in other words it will be selecting any span that is a sibling of me
[06:07:06] <shoky> ?height
[06:07:07] <bot-t> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[06:07:11] <shoky> ?css
[06:07:11] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[06:07:52] <DansVC> i will try it
[06:08:04] <shoky> GoSox:  $(this).siblings('span')  ?
[06:08:12] <GoSox> oh its that easy? score
[06:08:28] <shoky> the longer way would be .parent().children('span')
[06:08:50] <GoSox> i didn't know you filtered those selectors like that, thats great
[06:09:41] <GoSox> When defining my own function, is there a way I can make one of the arguments optional?
[06:09:49] <GoSox> (slightly o.t. i know)
[06:10:19] <shoky> they're all optional
[06:10:32] <GoSox> they are?
[06:10:35] <GoSox> that seems odd
[06:10:35] <shoky> depending on how you use them
[06:12:15] <DansVC> I can use in the .css a javacript function like the div1.x_position=div2.height
[06:15:00] <DansVC> wellcome
[06:18:35] <smallfoot-> is .click() deprecated in favor of .on('click', function() ?
[06:18:54] <GoSox> i've heard different things in here, on that
[06:18:58] <smallfoot-> oh
[06:23:01] <GoSox> I'm using the following command to insert some data into my page. And it works great except i'm not getting the animation. It just instantly appears.
[06:23:04] <GoSox> $("#id").parent().append("code").hide().slideDown('fast');
[06:23:39] <smallfoot-> try putting .hide after .slideDown maybe
[06:23:56] <DansVC> It's possible put something in negative top?
[06:24:19] <Joestar79> hi all
[06:24:26] <smallfoot-> hi
[06:24:47] <Joestar79> I have an autogenerated HTML which doesn't have id or name for labels
[06:25:09] <DansVC> hi
[06:25:11] <cusco> autogenerate it different :p
[06:25:20] <Joestar79> so I'm trying to find  function or something with which I can find a certain label and hide it
[06:25:29] <DansVC> thanks to everyone I do my problem
[06:25:30] <Joestar79> cusco: I can't
[06:25:53] <Joestar79> I have to work with that one, and I need to hide both the control and the label in certain case
[06:26:18] <cusco> and how do you know wich element you want to .hide() ?
[06:26:21] <Joestar79> can't I use jQuery to find a control if I know the InnerHTML?
[06:26:34] <cusco> sure
[06:26:39] <cusco> .each()
[06:26:50] <Joestar79> because programmatically I know which control I have to hide, so I should also hide the associated label
[06:27:19] <Joestar79> cusco: suppose I wanna cycle on all the labels present on that page
[06:27:36] <Joestar79> $("label").each() that would do?
[06:28:00] <Joestar79> $("label") <-- does this mean cycle on all the labels present on the current page?
[06:28:16] <cusco> that I am not sure, you mean html element <label> ?
[06:28:23] <Joestar79> yes
[06:28:49] <cusco> then that would cycle them all, yes

[06:50:21] <GoSox> Is there a way to replace these three lines of code with something simpler, something like the commented out single line? (which doesn't' actually work)
[06:50:23] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/kZVfR/
[06:52:28] <GoSox> maybe appendTo
[06:54:25] <cusco> GoSox: errors here http://jsfiddle.net/kZVfR/
[06:54:51] <GoSox> say what? also i did just get it working using appendTo instead of append
[06:55:01] <cusco> nvm
[06:55:03] <GoSox> $("<span>"+$error_message+"</span>").appendTo( $($badid).parent() ).hide().slideDown('fast');
[06:55:07] <cusco> partent
[06:55:29] <GoSox> partent?
[06:56:03] <cusco> parent
[06:56:07] <cusco> I was missing the parent
[06:56:13] <cusco> http://jsfiddle.net/kZVfR/2/ - it works
[06:56:16] <cusco> yyour single line
[06:57:00] <GoSox> actually it doesn't, it's sliding down $("#ID"), not the appended tag, which is what i wanted
[06:57:04] <GoSox> and got, with appendTo()
[06:57:06] <cusco> ah
[06:57:34] <cusco> but once you called .parent() you're not owrking with the appended string
[06:58:13] <GoSox> i'm not sure what you mean
[06:58:34] <cusco> .hide() is being applied to the .parent()
[06:59:03] <GoSox> right, well my point was just that it wasn't being applied to the appended tag
[06:59:34] <cusco> right point taken
[06:59:37] <cusco> I'm no expert

[13:13:58] <woopwoop> $('#test').click(function() { $('#content').html('<a class="clickable">test</a>'}); how can I make an element bindable from something that's been injected by jQuery?
[13:15:13] <smallfoot-> .on('click', function() { ... });
[13:15:19] <LocalPCGuy> ?on
[13:15:20] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:15:52] <gf3> `api on
[13:15:52] <b-ot> gf3, .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:15:57] <gf3> `api on @ woopwoop
[13:15:58] <b-ot> woopwoop, .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:16:23] <woopwoop> does that work on elements that's been injected into the DOM after a dom ready?
[13:16:28] <LocalPCGuy> woopwoop you need to make the on a live or delegate style handler.
[13:16:53] <LocalPCGuy> woopwoop something like $('#test').on('click', '.clickable', function (e) {});
[13:16:58] <gf3> woopwoop: Read the section in the docs "Direct and delegated events"
[13:17:27] <LocalPCGuy> woopwoop so #test listens for the click to bubble up to it, and if the click was on a .clickable class then executes the callback
[13:17:51] <LocalPCGuy> and listen to gf3 - read the docs so you understand what is happening
[13:18:00] <woopwoop> thanks
[13:18:24] <rymate1234> hey
[13:18:34] <rymate1234> how do I chop a string in javascript?
[13:18:47] <woopwoop> .split
[13:18:51] <rymate1234> k
[13:18:57] <LocalPCGuy> ?substring @ rymate1234
[13:19:15] <scar> if i want to prevent users from submitting a form with the ENTER/RETURN key without any hiccups along the way, can i jsut $(my_form).on("submit", function()); ?
[13:19:18] <LocalPCGuy> there are a few different ways
[13:20:18] <woopwoop> if (keycode == 13) { preventDefault
[13:20:22] <rymate1234> As an example - how would I limit a string to the first 20 characters
[13:20:44] <LocalPCGuy> scar also, consider that is bad usability and accessibility to prevent the enter key from submitting the form
[13:21:04] <scar> LocalPCGuy, i want the user to use ENTER to submit, but i want it to subit only via ajax, so i want to prevent default
[13:21:18] <LocalPCGuy> rymate1234 myString.substring(0,20);
[13:21:20] <scar> so, $(my_form).on("submit", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[13:21:20] <scar> ?
[13:21:32] <scar> the form needs not refresh the page =P
[13:21:35] <rymate1234> ah, thanks!
[13:21:37] <LocalPCGuy> scar yes, preventDefault should do it
[13:21:49] <scar> use it with on("submit") for the form, or submit button?
[13:21:52] <Afflicto> if I have a javascript object "myobject = {}", can I somehow implement jquerys event handling so I can do myObject.trigger('thisevent') ?

[13:37:20] <gf3> JCii8: Works for me
[13:37:27] <LocalPCGuy> guy there is probably a better way to do it rather than using .browser
[13:37:28] <guy> right. API docs seriously lack proper marking for deprecated features.
[13:37:46] <JCii8> can you paste what you typed into the console to get it to select ?
[13:37:59] <guy> LocalPCGuy: yeah, window.chrome is just enough for me. Though, I thought since $.browser is already there I will use it.
[13:38:38] <LocalPCGuy> guy the api has this right at the top: "version deprecated: 1.3, removed: 1.9"
[13:38:51] <JCii8> gf3: can you paste what you typed into the console to get it to select ?
[13:39:26] <gf3> JCii8: $("#tabs").tabs('option', 'active', 1)
[13:39:43] <JCii8> what browser?
[13:39:45] <gf3> JCii8: http://cloud.gf3.ca/MIBy
[13:39:52] <guy> yeah, people don't read every heading each time they view API. @see http://uk3.php.net/eregi that's obvious notice

[14:31:07] <LocalPCGuy> console is available in the developer tools, but you have to have it open I believe
[14:31:21] <systemfault> EPIK: If you have a console.log statement and the debugger is not opened‚Ä¶ it crashes.
[14:31:33] <Fall> yay if window.console
[14:32:25] <hugo_moss> thanks guys
[14:32:31] <EPIK> well it still sounds as though that was his/her issue :]
[14:32:33] <nick_omega> does this make sense: function display_li(event){ return jQuery(this).css( 'visibility', 'visible' ); }
[14:32:35] <EPIK> but TIL
[14:32:43] <nick_omega> Fall ^^
[14:32:55] <Fall> yes
[14:34:04] <LocalPCGuy> hugo_moss console || console = { log: function() {} };
[14:34:04] <gf3> Should probably add window in there for good measure
[14:34:12] <QbY> Can anyone point me to a tutorial on form validation with jQuery?  I want to provide pop ups when invalid data is there (or mismatched password and confirmation) and disable the submit button.
[14:34:18] <LocalPCGuy> yah...doing it from memory too, so not sure if it is 100% correct
[14:35:33] <gf3> LocalPCGuy: Otherwise you have to use typeof to prevent errors if `console` doesn't exist
[14:35:55] <Fall> really?
[14:36:03] <Fall> if( window.console) ftw
[14:36:28] <gf3> Fall: window.console || window.console = {log: function(){}}
[14:36:56] <LocalPCGuy> gf3 yup, I have the snippet I use on my work machine, I think it has it like that
[14:36:59] <gf3> Or: (window.console && window.console.log) || window.console = {log: function(){}}
[14:37:06] <Fall> uh huh :)
[14:37:43] <LocalPCGuy> been meaning to put my snippets in a synced dir
[14:38:27] <hugo_moss> wait so that adds an empty function to prevent it from crashing
[14:38:31] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[14:38:43] <hugo_moss> why not implement your own console?
[14:38:49] <hugo_moss> while your at it ;)
[14:38:56] <hugo_moss> you're
[14:39:12] <Fall> you could use Firebug Lite for User Agents that don't have dev tools..
[14:39:14] <hugo_moss> im jk
[14:39:15] <gf3> hugo_moss: Because presumable you don't want debugging output in production
[14:39:20] <gf3> *presumably
[14:39:49] <nick_omega> could someone take a look at this?  not sure where its failing.  im calling it i believe: http://pastebin.com/9jwSiiQM

[14:40:10] <hugo_moss> im as happy as a little school girl
[14:40:18] <LocalPCGuy> there are a couple of console.log implementations like that - like http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/ or http://paulirish.com/2009/log-a-lightweight-wrapper-for-consolelog/

[14:43:55] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega not sure why you are returning the visibility call.
[14:44:08] <coldhead> gf3: it's always means it's
[14:44:16] <coldhead> it's the exception to all the apostrophe rules

[14:46:04] <Fall> That's a bit harsh, don't you think?
[14:46:05] <LocalPCGuy> acedrew_ are you just including jquery UI source as a JS call, or trying to use it through some sort of Wordpress plugin?
[14:46:18] <coldhead> Fall: gf3 is a perfectionist
[14:46:29] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy doesnt that load the page with the modified css
[14:46:32] <Fall> coldhead: Ah...
[14:46:35] <acedrew_> wp_enqueu script, to footer
[14:46:42] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy i mean just change the css
[14:46:46] <nick_omega> not reload
[14:46:54] <nick_omega> the entire page
[14:47:01] <acedrew_> Thanks everyone, even snarky responses are responses.
[14:47:04] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega not if you use event.preventDefault()
[14:47:28] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega or return false but that is a bit overkill to just stop the link from executing
[14:47:38] <tw2113> who was snarky?
[14:47:41] <acedrew_> And the chief difference gf3, is that wordpress JQ defaults to noconflict
[14:48:13] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy not sure how i should modify the code
[14:48:35] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy your jargon is a bit advanced for me
[14:48:39] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega make a jsfiddle as gf3 has suggested
[14:48:49] <nick_omega> i did that http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/
[14:48:53] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega you can then execute your code and play with it
[14:48:54] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy ^^
[14:48:55] <gf3> acedrew_: Wrap your scripts in ;(function($){ ‚Ä¶ })(jQuery);
[14:48:59] <LocalPCGuy> ah, missed that
[14:49:17] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy i directed it at gf3.. maybe why
[14:49:38] <gf3> nick_omega: First, your CSS selector is wrong
[14:49:51] <acedrew_> jguery ui is already that way, I'm using jQuery() in my scripts
[14:50:14] <gf3> nick_omega: Secondly, it's not very easy to click something that is invisible
[14:50:45] <acedrew_> it's not mine that are the issue, it's that jquery ui seems to be loading, but is not overloading the existing jQuery functions like it's supposed to.
[14:50:58] <gf3> nick_omega: Also you forgot to load jQuery in the sidebar
[14:51:02] <acedrew_> in particular the easing
[14:51:10] <gf3> nick_omega: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/3/
[14:51:40] <scar> if i have a selector selecting more than one item using a , how can i determine which was clicked?
[14:51:43] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega your script is working like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/2/ but the link is already visible in your example (plus there would be nothing to click if your CSS actually did make it hidden, as gf3 stated)
[14:52:06] <nick_omega> ok heres an update: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/6/
[14:52:44] <nick_omega> now whats happening is that the text is visible from the start before clicking the anchor
[14:53:10] <toad-br> <LocalPCGuy> i like http://jsfiddle.net/2XMMu/
[14:53:24] <coldhead> great work everyone, i'm really proud of you all
[14:54:05] <LocalPCGuy> scar "this" in your callback function will reference the DOM element that was clicked
[14:54:17] <nick_omega> gf3: i left out a key piece of html, please see the new jsfiddle.  you click the one and the other is supposed to become visible
[14:54:46] <LocalPCGuy> scar you can wrap that in a jQuery function if you need to use jQuery functionality - $(this)
[14:55:04] <gf3> nick_omega: No <style> tags in the CSS block
[14:55:14] <_acedrew> back, sorry
[14:55:25] <gf3> nick_omega: You can't have two elements with the same ID
[14:55:37] <nick_omega> ive updated the html.  now its not visible from the start.  sorry about that: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/7/
[14:56:19] <nick_omega> this one: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/9/
[14:56:24] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega don't overqualify your elements in your CSS - you don't need ul#demo-block for example, just do #demo-block
[14:57:02] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega and the li#more_info will not select the link, it looks for an li with an id of more_info
[14:57:54] <LocalPCGuy> toad-br I tried to use a log function rather than console.log, but could never get used to doing that - always would just start typing console.log and have to fix it
[15:00:24] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/10/
[15:01:09] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega changed the ids to classes so the pattern can be re-used for multiple elements and used jquery to navigate to the more_info_text li to show it
[15:02:01] <gf3> nick_omega: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/11/
[15:02:09] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy the anchor id gets read by jqeury which runs display_li which ive been told changes the css to display: visible.  not sure where im going wrong.  suspecting its return jQuery(this).css('visibility', 'visible'); not specifying the right html string?
[15:02:22] <nick_omega> jQuery*
[15:02:47] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega that works just fine, although I'd still not "return" that
[15:02:54] <LocalPCGuy> it is just referencing the wrong element
[15:03:12] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy my code works on your machine?
[15:03:43] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega this does: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/12/
[15:05:32] <nick_omega> gf3, thanks, that worked, ill study that
[15:05:43] <gf3> nick_omega: NP
[15:07:58] <nick_omega> im not sure which of your codes would be considered 'better' or more elegant
[15:08:14] <nick_omega> between gf3 and LocalPCGuy
[15:08:41] <gf3> nick_omega: They're different
[15:09:27] <gf3> nick_omega: You could technically combine his and mine for ultimate robustness and reusability
[15:10:06] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega mine probably ties it more closely to the DOM structure, which can be bad if you don't control that.  I agree with gf3, a combination would be better
[15:10:28] <nick_omega> now on a different topic, i bet it would be simple to add a slideout function to this, yes?
[15:11:59] <gf3> nick_omega: http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/13/
[15:16:22] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega you just need to update the visible function to use slideDown instead of change the visible attribute
[15:16:25] <LocalPCGuy> http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/14/
[15:16:43] <gf3> nick_omega: Also why visibility and not display?
[15:17:23] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega oh, I had to change visibility to display for the slideDown to work
[15:18:30] <nick_omega> gf3, i tried display: none first but for some reason it wouldn't work.  that was a while ago I don't recall the details
[15:20:59] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy did you change anything besides the code in the javascript box for http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/14/  its not working for me
[15:21:32] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega I changed the visbility: hidden in the css to display:none (and removed the display: inline)
[15:25:16] <toad-br> http://jsfiddle.net/7udyB/15/

[15:25:59] <toad-br> Afflicto, yes
[15:27:07] <Afflicto> Cool so I'm guess it's the same with <link rel="stylesheet"> too?
[15:27:58] <toad-br> Afflicto, I've never tried it = P

[15:32:16] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy: did you leave any of the other js and add js or should this replace any previously spoken of js (to simply become visible and slideout)?  I'm here http://jsfiddle.net/vEjhL/ and there's nothing being displayed or sliding
[15:32:47] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega in the one label /14/ it worked on my machine
[15:32:57] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega as a slideDown
[15:33:25] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega you missed a line in your JS
[15:33:27] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy i left out an li that i thought was irrelevant, maybe the closest is not working due to that, hmm
[15:33:51] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega nope, not in the HTML, it was a line missing in the JS
[15:35:33] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega specifically the click event
[15:38:04] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy: ive added in that js line, turns out i had it in the code just didn't copy/paste to jsfiddle.  this time ive pasted the extra line of html i have.  will the closest('li') choose that other line that comes before the li line we've been discussing?  this still isn't running correctly for me: http://jsfiddle.net/vEjhL/4/
[15:41:20] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega there is a typo in your HTML - iclass on the more_info li
[15:41:46] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega and you don't have jQuery selected in the framework
[15:42:02] <LocalPCGuy> http://jsfiddle.net/vEjhL/7/
[15:42:13] <nick_omega> oh my... there we go
[15:45:28] <nick_omega> now i just need to make it disappear as the slideshow moves to the next slide and start all over.... using this btw: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/slideshow/3.2/demo.html

[16:00:34] <mads-> BinaryKitten, hi. You helped me a day or two ago by answering what "$.newFunction" was for. You said it attached the newFunction to the jQuery prototype chain. I haven't been able to find information about this. Do you know what I would search Google for in order to find stuff about it?
[16:02:45] <coldhead> mads-: it's midnight monday morning for BinaryKitten
[16:04:52] <mads-> Then I hope he is sleeping :)
[16:05:00] <mads-> coldhead, do you know the answer to my question?
[16:05:30] <mads-> I'm just trying to find out why one would make a new function with $.newFunction instead of just newFunction?
[16:10:00] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy whats the purpose of preventDefault() in your code?  i dont see what it's doing
[16:10:23] <coldhead> i've never heard of newFunction i'm sorr
[16:10:23] <coldhead> y
[16:10:30] <coldhead> can't see any documentation for it either
[16:10:42] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega it stops the browser from executing/following the link
[16:11:13] <LocalPCGuy> mads- I'm with coldhead, never heard of a newFunction, and the string doesn't exist in the jQuery source code
[16:11:20] <mads-> coldhead, I'm sorry. newFunction is just a new function being created.
[16:11:28] <mads-> Let me show you the code in question :)
[16:11:47] <LocalPCGuy> mads- you mean new Function?
[16:12:12] <LocalPCGuy> mvr mind, I get it
[16:12:44] <mads-> http://ideone.com/c4UPRr - here it is.
[16:13:08] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy to prevent the href in the anchor?
[16:13:11] <mads-> Looking at $.addMembers I'm not sure what the "$." does there
[16:13:13] <nick_omega> from executing
[16:13:21] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega yup
[16:15:29] <mads-> LocalPCGuy or coldhead do you know what that means?
[16:15:47] <LocalPCGuy> mads- what is the goal of the function?  if it is a generic function that executes your code, there is no reason to attach it to the jQuery object
[16:15:50] <nick_omega> LocalPCGuy ok... thanks for that.  now, is it going to be very time consuming to make that div go back into hiding everytime this jquery plugin switches to a new slide by itself?
[16:16:38] <mads-> LocalPCGuy, that's what I'm trying to find out. So in this particular case there is no reason that $.addMembers just couldn't be plain and simple addMembers?
[16:17:00] <mads-> But, what would be a reason for adding a function to the jquery object?
[16:17:22] <coldhead> hanging it off jquery makes it accessible wherever jquery is accessible
[16:17:29] <coldhead> you're just using jQUery as a namespace
[16:17:33] <LocalPCGuy> mads- seems like it would be better as a standalone function.  You might look into putting all of your functions into an object literal though, to avoid adding it to the global namespace
[16:19:31] <mads-> Cool. I will look into it "adding to jquery object" seems to yield answers on google.
[16:19:51] <LocalPCGuy> look into object literal pattern as well
[16:21:01] <mads-> The way of putting stuff into a namespace, right?
[16:21:30] <LocalPCGuy> in effect
[16:22:22] <mads-> I know that one. I just wasn't sure what this particular piece of code did
[16:22:30] <coldhead> nothing special
[16:22:37] <LocalPCGuy> ok
[16:22:40] <coldhead> $.fn.newFucntion is speciall
[16:22:46] <mads-> So thank you :)
[16:22:51] <coldhead> $.newFunction is just hanging a fn off of jQuery
[16:22:52] <JosephFritzll> how to make a gay fuck a woman?
[16:22:53] <JosephFritzll> shit her into cunt
[16:23:17] <LocalPCGuy> ah, I see the 13 year olds found the channel
[16:23:56] <coldhead> BinaryKitten: stand down
[16:24:16] <JosephFritzll> LocalPCGuy u mad?
[16:25:22] <LocalPCGuy> nick_omega you may need to alter your HTML for it to work well in a tabs plugin, but depending on the plugin it should be fairly easy to use slideUp to hide the content on tab change
[16:40:00] <zim> Hi all. Got a problem passing objects please could someone have a look http://jsfiddle.net/9LAe6/
[16:41:27] <zim> God never seen #jquery so quiet
[16:42:47] <b1lly> is that bad
[16:43:02] <b1lly> zim: please tell me what the problem is and what your trying to accomplish
[16:43:22] <LocalPCGuy> zim you cannot return json there because it is defined in the callback function
[16:43:48] <zim> How would I get it out then?
[16:44:02] <b1lly> it's limited to the scope of the function
[16:44:32] <zim> Ty I get that but what is the correct wat to pass it out?
[16:44:55] <LocalPCGuy> zim one way is to run your code from the callback function, another is to setup the JSON variable outside of the scope and then access it within the scope
[16:45:13] <b1lly> you can declare the json variable outside the function
[16:45:32] <zim> I think I tried that but must have got it wrong
[16:46:03] <LocalPCGuy> zim actually, you need to call it from the callback function, because otherwise it won't be executed in the correct order
[16:46:35] <LocalPCGuy> zim I would setup a function that handles the content, and call that from the callback function, passing the data along to that function as a parameter
[16:46:36] <zim> Sorry you lost me.
[16:46:50] <b1lly> you can use the $.ajax method, and pass in asynchrounous: false
[16:47:07] <LocalPCGuy> zim yah...don't do that (asyn false)
[16:48:54] <zim> So very lost now? is there a way I can pass the object back to the original function?
[16:49:38] <LocalPCGuy> zim ajax is an asyncronous method, but your original function will continue to execute synchronously
[16:50:13] <LocalPCGuy> zim so no, you can't have your function "wait" for the response before executing the rest of the code (at least, it is a bad idea, as your entire program would hang while waiting for the response)
[16:50:47] <zim> TY. back to the drawing board

[17:41:33] <sunbeam> is there a way to test whether the location an element is in is outside the mentioned height of the parent?
[17:41:45] <sunbeam> (without using .top or offset as this doesn't work  consistently)
[17:42:15] <sunbeam> i'm using overflow: hidden and i'm trying to find which elements fall outside the box
[17:46:47] <coldhead> i don't know of a general solution for that, sunbeam
[17:46:59] <coldhead> i'd be testing offsets and width and such
[17:53:31] <sunbeam> yea i did
[18:07:19] <ctorp> Could anyone look at this: absurdnerd.com/wlion/ , and tell me why the first half of the table under "Archive" is not getting the .click handler that should be attached by the .each loop in the success handler for the index ajax request?
[18:09:12] <caleb_io> Seems like it is.
[18:10:44] <caleb_io> Altough when refreshing the page all of your tables are initially visible and then hidden.
[18:11:04] <hugo_moss> is there some way to control the loading order of fonts in a browser?
[18:12:24] <caleb_io> Aer you using Typekit or anything similar? Typekit uses WebFontLoader IIRC
[18:12:37] <caleb_io> And load order then shouldn't mader as it takes care of fout.
[18:12:43] <caleb_io> are*
[18:13:19] <ctorp> caleb_io: fixing the css now.
[18:13:41] <caleb_io> ctorp it seems though that they have the click events, although your request was rather vague.  I click on one of the articles and it takes me to the form view.
[18:13:47] <caleb_io> Is that the one you meant?
[18:14:19] <ctorp> Kinda. If I click the archive link, then the recent, then the archive, the first 5 or so items are not clickable
[18:15:31] <caleb_io> are you properly cleaning up the events when you switch tabs?
[18:16:09] <ctorp> caleb_io: I'm not sure. This is my first forray into js for this purpose.
[18:16:53] <caleb_io> I see, I haven't seen the code but it seems that's probably the cause.  The first 5 or so that are not clickable are the ones that are also shown on the recent page.
[18:16:55] <caleb_io> not sure if you noticed that
[18:18:01] <caleb_io> ah found out why.
[18:18:41] <caleb_io> So when you go to archive, it loads those with rows with #10, #11, etc.  You're binding to $('#10').click
[18:18:54] <caleb_io> when you go to Recent it also loads those articles and binds to $('#10').click.
[18:19:07] <caleb_io> When you come back to archive, it binds again to $('#10').click and those are still on the page just not hidden
[18:19:26] <caleb_io> seems you're only hiding the container divs,    $("#recent").hide();
[18:19:27] <caleb_io>     $("#index").hide();
[18:19:27] <caleb_io>     $("#details").hide();
[18:19:28] <ctorp> caleb_io so it is an issue with the items having the same id?
[18:19:56] <caleb_io> the simplest solution is for each "view" to prefix their rows with like "recent-10", "index-10", etc
[18:20:05] <caleb_io> and bind to $('#index-' + this.id)
[18:20:10] <caleb_io> and bind to $('#recent-' + this.id)
[18:20:12] <ctorp> Ahh
[18:20:22] <ctorp> Thank you so much!
[18:20:27] <ctorp> It would have taken me hours to realize that
[18:20:29] <caleb_io> But the bigger issue here is that you're not cleaning up your views in between tab switches.
[18:20:34] <caleb_io> You bind on top of bind.
[18:20:43] <ctorp> So I should be using .unbind?
[18:20:46] <caleb_io> So if I switched back and forth 100 times, I'd be in memory hell because you have all of these bindings.
[18:21:20] <caleb_io> I would actually say use .on and .off
[18:22:13] <ctorp> hmm
[18:22:20] <ctorp> I haven't dont that before. I'll read the docs.
[18:22:36] <caleb_io> Check this out ctorp: http://docs.jquery.com/Manipulation/empty
[18:22:56] <caleb_io> when you switch tabs you can call .empty on the container div which will remove all the events and remove the rows from the dom.
[18:23:54] <ctorp> !
[18:23:59] <ctorp> That looks so simple
[18:28:35] <ctorp> It worked. That was a 2 line fix. I'll have more time to fix it properly tomorrow with new id names
[18:29:45] <caleb_io> Awesome!
[18:29:54] <caleb_io> Let me know if you need anything else
[18:30:52] <wolfgang42> Is there an easy way to find out whether an element has a parent that's an <a> using jquery?
[18:31:08] <LocalPCGuy> ?closest
[18:32:03] <wolfgang42> LocalPCGuy: Was that for me? If so, I don't understand.
[18:32:06] <LocalPCGuy> wolfgang42 you can use .parent('a').length
[18:32:18] <LocalPCGuy> wolfgang42 are you looking for only the direct parent, or any parent?
[18:32:37] <wolfgang42> Any parent
[18:32:48] <caleb_io> .closest('a') then
[18:32:54] <LocalPCGuy> wolfgang42 .parent() looks at the direct parent, you can use .closest for any parent
[18:33:11] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot api closest @ wolfgang42
[18:33:12] <b-ot> wolfgang42, .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:33:37] <wolfgang42> Thanks :)
[18:33:59] <wolfgang42> That's exactly what I'm looking for
[18:34:09] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[19:28:12] <tiffanyAmber> hi guys!
[19:28:14] <tiffanyAmber> I have this
[19:28:15] <tiffanyAmber> 'onUploadSuccess' : function(file, data, response) { alert('The file was saved to: ' + data); } you know how can I use the data into a php var?
[19:30:54] <monk3y> tiffanyAmber: uh .. you mean you want to use the data once the upload has worked .. in jQuery on the client-side?
[19:31:57] <tiffanyAmber> I want to use it on a php var
[19:32:04] <tiffanyAmber> I want to use it later on php
[19:32:10] <tiffanyAmber> I have it on js but not on php
[19:32:16] <saimon69> any human here that know a bit of DOM?
[19:32:30] <tw2113> tiffanyAmber, you
[19:32:36] <tw2113> you'll have to ajax it into php
[19:32:42] <coldhead> tiffanyAmber: by the time the success handler runs PHP is already done with your dat
[19:32:44] <coldhead> a
[19:32:50] <coldhead> it's toooo laaaate
[19:32:51] <tw2113> by the time you're doing anything with JS, the php is already run
[19:32:58] <tw2113> what newbie said
[19:34:15] <saimon69> trying to get the index of the parent div where am clicking the 'move up' link, it returns -1 ergo am not doing it right - http://jsfiddle.net/rPkPg/
[19:37:48] <angelazou> hi, i have a jquery script that allows drag and drop
[19:38:03] <angelazou> it works very well on desktops, but doesn't on tablets and mobile devices
[19:38:23] <angelazou> i have already tried a hack called the touch punch, but it didn't seem to work
[19:39:24] <LocalPCGuy> angelazou it is likely that you would need to rewrite the drag/drop to handle both mouse and touch events
[19:39:46] <LocalPCGuy> angelzou or find one that already handles both (I don't know of one off-hand)
[19:39:56] <angelazou> I see, thanks
[19:40:04] <wolfgang42> I think with Apple touchpads at least there's a way to get it to generate mouse events
[19:40:24] <coldhead> guys i'm worried we're in another tech bubble
[19:40:30] <wolfgang42> I *think* that if you set onclick="void(0)" it forces it to generate mouse events
[19:41:14] <LocalPCGuy> wolfgang42 that probably wouldn't work for drag events, becuase in addition to the click event you need the mousemove event
[19:41:17] <coldhead> yikes
[19:41:23] <LocalPCGuy> wolfgang42 and seems like a bad idea
[19:41:42] <wolfgang42> Well, it was in Apple's official documentation
[19:41:55] <LocalPCGuy> coldhead definitely in a tech bubble, the question is, how long until it bursts - 1year?  5year?  longer?
[19:42:04] <tw2113> what type of tech bubble?
[19:43:00] <coldhead> maybe less
[19:43:11] <coldhead> tw2113: a spherical one
[19:43:36] <tw2113> ahhh
[19:44:25] <hugo_moss> is there some way to control the loading order of fonts in a browser?
[19:53:12] <krz> how do i check if a var is present?
[19:54:21] <coldhead> typeof some_var !== 'undefined'
[19:54:44] <krz> typ
[19:54:49] <krz> typeof(var) === 'undefined'
[19:55:17] <coldhead> that's how you test that it doesn't exist
[19:55:21] <LocalPCGuy> krz typeof is not a function
[19:55:46] <saimon69> anybody got a clue? am stuck
[19:59:28] <LocalPCGuy> saimon69 you should not be using javascript:function() in the href.  Look up .on for doing it all in the JS file
[19:59:44] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot api on @saimon69
[19:59:45] <b-ot> saimon69, .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:00:33] <saimon69> beside that how can i get the index?
[20:01:21] <LocalPCGuy> the on() callback function "this" will be set to the item that was clicked
[20:01:30] <LocalPCGuy> so you can do $(this).index()
[20:01:37] <LocalPCGuy> inside of your callback function
[20:03:12] <saimon69> LocalPCGuy: my final attempt is to be able to move those divs before or after each other to reorder them
[20:03:48] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot api after @saimon69
[20:03:49] <b-ot> saimon69, .after(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[20:04:29] <LocalPCGuy> so on click, you get the index of the element, find the next element, and then use after to insert the click element after the next element (and reverse for moveUp)
[20:04:49] <saimon69> LocalPCGuy: but i need the index of the other element to swap with, can i just do a index -1 for up and index +1 for down?
[20:06:11] <LocalPCGuy> saimon69 you'll want a collection of all of your divs (i.e. $('.element')), and on that you can do .eq(thisItemIndex + 1)
[20:06:17] <LocalPCGuy> (or -1)
[20:06:27] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot eq @saimon69
[20:06:33] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot api eq @saimon69
[20:06:34] <b-ot> saimon69, .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:08:15] <saimon69> LocalPCGuy: $('.element a.moveUp').click() might work too?
[20:08:31] <saimon69> or gotta use on?
[20:09:55] <LocalPCGuy> you could use .click - all it does is make a call to .on though
[20:09:59] <LocalPCGuy> just an alias
[20:38:36] <poot> hello. Ive loaded an image from a url with $.get() ... how do i append the loaded data into an image element? when i append it to a div, i see garbage
[20:42:34] <grafi> garbage?
[20:42:50] <trinadh> poot: appending the link with img tag to the div isn't possible..?
[20:43:16] <wolfgang42> He sees the raw image data
[20:43:20] <Afflicto> Has anyone used history.js ?
[20:43:25] <domo> how can I bundle jquery with some javascript of mine into one file?
[20:43:32] <tab1293> after loading html from another page with ajax, how do i refresh the dom so i can select newly added elements?
[20:43:35] <poot> right, its all strange characters
[20:43:48] <domo> would I simply add my js to the jquery source and load it normally?
[20:44:15] <Es0teric> has anyone here used slidesjs?
[20:44:38] <wolfgang42> domo: I believe so, yes
[20:44:55] <trinadh> poot : take a look at this..  http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/inline-images/
[20:45:10] <poot> ok
[20:45:11] <wolfgang42> tab1293: If you put it in the dom, it's in the dom. You shouldn't need to 'refresh' anything
[20:45:24] <Es0teric> ok so i am using slidesjs and for some reason, the navigation doesnt show... how do i fix that?
[20:46:42] <tab1293> wolfgang42: i guess the better question is how do you put it in the dom?
[20:47:19] <tab1293> because after i load external html into the page i cannot select it
[20:47:25] <Es0teric> nevermind
[20:47:57] <wolfgang42> tab1293: Something like document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML=documentText;
[20:48:29] <tab1293> wolfgang42: preferably with jquery
[20:49:11] <grafi> how do you do it currently tab1293 ?
[20:50:34] <tab1293> grafi: http://pastebin.ca/2305149
[20:50:42] <tab1293> tokenVal is null
[20:51:51] <grafi> probably because the get is async and not there yet, at the time you try to assign it
[20:52:16] <tab1293> so should i put it in the callback?
[20:53:00] <grafi> that would at least show the real text then
[20:54:48] <tab1293> grafi: http://pastebin.ca/2305150 still gives me undefined
[20:56:36] <grafi> yeah well still the same problem ;) the alert is executed before the callback is called therefore tokenVal is still undefined at that time
[20:57:16] <grafi> whats the overall goal you are trying to achieve?
[20:57:29] <coldhead> global domination
[20:57:43] <grafi> dont we all
[20:57:44] <grafi> ;)
[20:59:44] <tab1293> grafi im trying to load the token to later post to a php script
[21:00:35] <caleb_io> of course the alert will happen before, the $.get is processed and then it hits alert.
[21:00:53] <caleb_io> the callback (that stores tokenVal) doesn't get executed until the server responds, it's a callback.
[21:01:06] <caleb_io> you'd need to do the alert inside the callback if you ever wanted it to have a value.
[21:01:37] <grafi> and when woudl that 'later' be tab1293 ?
[21:02:55] <tab1293> when the user clicks a button or something grafi. so i guess the question should be how can i guranteed that this token is loaded before the user acts
[21:03:16] <caleb_io> disable the button until the success callback happens?
[21:03:39] <tab1293> i guess maybe i should just get the token in the php script
[21:03:46] <grafi> probably
[21:04:25] <tab1293> okay
[21:04:34] <tab1293> thanks anyway guys
[21:05:35] <coldhead> great work everyone
[21:05:44] <grafi> take 5
[21:05:45] <grafi> ^^
[21:12:02] <caleb_io> haha
[21:52:10] <mehwork> what's the diff between var e = $('#e') and var $e = $('#e') ?
[21:52:40] <wolfgang42> #1 makes a variable named e, #2 makes a variable named $e
[21:53:01] <mehwork> wolfgang42: but $e is more correct when assigning a jquery object?
[21:53:33] <wolfgang42> It's all a matter of style and personal preference
[21:53:36] <LocalPCGuy> mehwork it is good practice to put a $ before a variable that is a jquery object, but it is just a convention
[21:53:45] <mehwork> k
[21:54:09] <coldhead> if you don't follow that convention you're off my team
[21:58:09] * wolfgang42 really *ought* to follow that convention
[21:58:54] <coldhead> i think the more often you have $s in your code the more you can charge
[21:59:02] <coldhead> i haven't based this on science
[21:59:11] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[22:08:59] <krz> how do i return the li with the data attribute foo =1 ?
[22:09:00] <hariom> I have a typical requirement. One of the ajax is loading html content in background and another ajax gets fired when the user clicks a button. I want to insure that until the first ajax is done, second should wait (but second is dependent on click request or direct call to the url where no click happens). How to do that?
[22:09:37] <krz> basally want to return: <li data-foo="1">
[22:09:54] <coldhead> krz: $('[data-foo="1"]')
[22:10:03] <coldhead> slow though :(
[22:10:19] <Fall> li[data-foo="1"] :D
[22:10:48] <krz> thanks
[22:11:01] <coldhead> hariom: if you can be bothered learning to do it the right way you can do it with Promises and Deferreds
[22:11:18] <coldhead> if you are lazy you'd just disable the 2nd element until the 1st AJAX comes back
[22:12:50] <coldhead> my english rose, my lionheart
[22:24:03] <martisj> is there a way to listen for a class being added to an element?
[22:28:37] <coldhead> not across browsers
[22:29:44] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver
[22:29:45] <b1lly> martisj: what do you mean?
[22:30:07] <martisj> Nvm i'll find some other way of doing it
[22:30:13] <martisj> it's not very flexible.
[22:30:26] <b1lly> you can check to see if an element has a class
[22:30:37] <b1lly> but I don't think you can "listen" for an element to change
[22:31:26] <coldhead> you could monkeypatch addClass and test for it there
[22:31:37] <coldhead> people will hate you for it but it's fun
[22:32:03] <coldhead> much like clubbing baby seals to death
[22:33:06] <b1lly> monkeypatch?
[22:33:23] <b1lly> are you saying use something like "setInterval" and check the element
[22:35:41] <coldhead> i mean like http://jsfiddle.net/7ZL9J/
[22:37:02] <b1lly> oh
[22:37:10] <b1lly> like extending teh jquery addClass function
[22:37:36] <caleb_io> extend the jquery addClass function to trigger a class:add event on it?
[22:37:47] <caleb_io> then listen for $('#something').on('addClass', function() {});
[22:37:57] <coldhead> that would work nicely, yes
[22:38:01] <caleb_io> not sure if that's feasible but it may be the right solution in your case.
[22:38:28] <caleb_io> or even better.. make your own function that's like addClassAndNotify or something named better.
[22:38:32] <b1lly> thats really cool idea
[22:39:05] <coldhead> http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[22:40:00] <caleb_io> if it were me I would probably make a wrapper function that internally calls addClass, but then triggers the event.
[22:40:30] <caleb_io> or at least add an option to addClass that says trigger: true, or something.
[22:40:30] <coldhead> that's cleanest and doesn't break anything
[22:42:58] <warden23> Hello I'm trying to fix a clients website, as suddenly their menu dropdowns stopped working, is anyone able to tell me if the issue is superfish/jquery problem? http://www.churchlands.org.au/
[22:43:32] <warden23> Hovering over a dropdown should show the dropdown menu but even when you click it.. it takes you to a blank page..
[22:43:44] <caleb_io> it's a superfish problem
[22:43:52] <caleb_io> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[22:43:59] <caleb_io> superfish.js line 64
[22:43:59] <coldhead> http://www.churchlands.org.au/Portals/0/bodyscripts.js
[22:44:24] <caleb_io> that too ;)
[22:44:26] <coldhead> supernatural ministry huh
[22:44:39] <b1lly> caleb_io: when you extend a jquery function
[22:44:42] <warden23> it's a clients website not mine ;)
[22:45:01] <b1lly> why do you need to set var _oldfunc = $.fn.oldfunc
[22:45:01] <coldhead> yes no judgment
[22:45:11] <caleb_io> b1illy, because you need to still call the old function.
[22:45:22] <caleb_io> Usually a monkey patch isn't a replacement for the old function, it's just adding extra functionality to it.
[22:45:31] <b1lly> oh I see
[22:45:36] <caleb_io> so you save off _oldFunc and then overwrite it and call _oldFunc inside the overwritten function
[22:45:38] <coldhead> we call that "advise" in emacs
[22:46:00] <warden23> Is that problem hard to fix caleb_io?
[22:46:20] <b1lly> and why do you "return the invoked oldfunc"
[22:46:23] <caleb_io> well, I'd start off with having bodyscripts actually be there.. it may contain something that superfish needs.
[22:46:32] <b1lly> aka return _oldfunc.apply(...);
[22:46:43] <caleb_io> b1lly because you want the return value of it.
[22:46:52] <caleb_io> for instance patching addClass you'd want what addClass returns back.
[22:47:03] <caleb_io> as with jQuery you can chain things.... .addClass('test').addClass('test')
[22:47:07] <b1lly> AH
[22:47:08] <LocalPCGuy> warden23 looks like you are using the "latest" version of jquery, and when they updated to 1.9 recently, they removed $.browser, which your other script is still calling
[22:47:29] <LocalPCGuy> you should always peg your jQuery to a specific version and then update after testing
[22:47:30] <warden23> Oh okay, so if I use an older version of jquery it should fix it?
[22:47:33] <LocalPCGuy> (IMO)
[22:47:42] <LocalPCGuy> 1.8.x
[22:47:51] <warden23> Ok I will try that, thanks
[22:47:56] <LocalPCGuy> although it might be better to remove the dependency on $.browser
[22:48:15] <LocalPCGuy> that is in the superfish script
[22:48:24] <warden23> ah
[22:58:02] <grafi> $.browser is removed?
[22:58:03] <grafi> :o
[23:01:27] <systemfault> Yep, about time..
[23:02:46] <coldhead> sure has broken a lot of the interwebs :D
[23:03:10] <coldhead> OMG WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE DEPRECATED FEATURE I WAS RELYING ON IN SPITE OF THE WARNINGSSS
[23:03:19] <systemfault> Interwebz0rs had 6 jquery major versions to fix their plugins
[23:04:03] <warden23> so if I remove $.browser that could also fix my issue?
[23:04:53] <coldhead> warden23: unless you really feel like changing someone else's code i'd just use the older perfectly good jQuery
[23:05:08] <coldhead> if you stick with the latest version something else may break in it later
[23:05:27] <coldhead> and on that bombshell
[23:06:02] <warden23> except for the fact I can't find where jquery is being inputed on this messy site so going to try the browser thing first
[23:07:57] <warden23> I'm a newb when it comes to jquery hence why im here lol: could someone pls edit this to remove $.browser ? http://jsfiddle.net/8ynzD/
[23:08:43] <tw2113> tell the plugin author to update his script
[23:09:30] <warden23> i doubt he will
[23:09:31] <warden23> or she
[23:09:47] <tw2113> they will want to if they want to stay relevant
[23:10:03] <warden23> true, but i need an inbetween
[23:10:31] <vladikoff> i newbie js dev can fix that stuff up
[23:10:59] <warden23> if i just remove: if (sf.op.dropShadows  && !($.browser.msie && $.browser.version < 7)) menuClasses.push(c.shadowClass); lines it should be good enough?
[23:11:07] <warden23> there are 4 instances of it
[23:11:12] <vladikoff> ?tias
[23:11:13] <b-ot> vladikoff, Try it and see
[23:11:47] <warden23> 2 lines of it rather
[23:11:56] <warden23> line 64 and line 74
[23:12:30] <warden23> or from that line do I only remove: && !($.browser.msie && $.browser.version < 7))
[23:12:31] <warden23> ?
[23:13:11] <grafi> well you cant just remove some lines and expect it to work ;)
[23:13:33] <warden23> :(
[23:13:41] <tw2113> it'd take testing
[23:13:52] <tw2113> knowing what consequences there may be
[23:15:31] <warden23> ok removed the $.browser problem now it says:
[23:15:31] <warden23> Error: TypeError: menu is undefined
[23:15:31] <warden23> Source File: http://www.churchlands.org.au/Portals/_default/Skins/ccf/Superfish/superfish.js
[23:15:31] <warden23> Line: 35
[23:16:37] <warden23> hmm maybe working out where the jquery.min is inserted may be easier and just roll it back to 1.8.x as suggested just it's a messy site they have :p
[23:19:43] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/8ynzD/1/

[23:49:45] <aaas> I would like to place an elment (say, a diamond) relative to another elment (say a rectangle) along an relative x-axis.  could someone point me to the functions I would use to do this? or a search term for more info? or a jsfiddle?
[23:55:15] <maZtah> morning, how would i get the '#part' of an URL?
[23:56:57] <_sCoRpi> maZtah: window.location.hash
[23:57:15] <maZtah> thanks _sCoRpi !
[23:57:19] <_sCoRpi> welcome
[23:58:12] <xec> aaas: sounds like a job for css (?)
[23:58:43] <xec> what is a "relative x-axis" btw
[23:59:33] <aaas> xec well i just mean relative to the x-axis of the other element.  so I want to do it with javascript because I want to pass parameters to the javascript form the db
