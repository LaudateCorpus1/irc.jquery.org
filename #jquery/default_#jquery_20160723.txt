[10:30:24] <d2k> Hello, I have a website which has mobile clearly separated from desktop version. They both use the same HTML markup but the CSS is different going as far as replacing html-content-images with css-background-images. However the html-content-images still get loaded even their are masked.
[10:31:27] <d2k> Regarding this I have a question: Since the parsing let's Javascript load before image files is it possible to hinder the html-content-images from beeing loaded at all?
[10:32:21] <d2k> for network performance reasons this would be awesome and concluding my overall attempt
[10:34:32] <snover> d2k: no. also, you should probably be using <picture> or something.
[10:48:45] <WhirledPress> i can put a jquery object in a data-prefixed property of an element like data-dest=$(".someClass"), but can I do that on the element creation? $(
[10:49:24] <WhirledPress> $("<li data-dest="+$("#item")+"></li>");
[10:50:17] <shoky> WhirledPress: you can't put objects in attributes at all. attributes are strings
[10:51:04] <shoky> if you meant jquery .data() then you can do $('<li>').data('dest', whatever);
[10:51:10] <WhirledPress> how come you can say $("elem").data("dest",$("#item")); and reference $("#item") as a jquery object
[10:51:18] <shoky> because .data() is not data-attributes
[10:51:42] <WhirledPress> I don't know why I have such a hard time with that.
[10:51:44] <shoky> it uses an internal jquery cache in memory, not in any attributes on tags
[10:51:56] <shoky> .data() can only READ from data-attributes, not write
[10:52:05] <shoky> so just use .data()
[10:52:08] <shoky> to write and read
[10:53:04] <WhirledPress> shoky, thanks  jquery is pretty amazing that can cache that and keep track of it
[10:53:28] <shoky> it just keeps a property on the element that points to its internal data
[10:53:32] <shoky> pretty simple :P
[10:54:14] <WhirledPress> so maybe I should just keep the id of the referenced element rather than caching the jquery object...
[10:54:35] <shoky> why
[10:55:45] <WhirledPress> I guess because if it's a string, i could do $(($("elem").data("destid")) as easily as $("elem").data("dest");
[10:56:11] <shoky> why would you want to do the first and not the second?
[10:56:11] <taplar> but that would be an extra lookup
[10:56:39] <WhirledPress> which is worse, an extra lookup or hundreds of cached jquery objects?
[10:56:57] <shoky> it MIGHT be a good idea to do that if you had a LOT of these jquery objects but they arent in much use most of the time, and you have memory issues or something
[10:57:10] <shoky> cause keeping a reference to them in jquery data will keep them from getting garbage collected
[10:57:24] <shoky> but you only need to worry about that if you are seeing memory issues
[10:58:06] <shoky> do you keep a reference to those hundreds of jquery objects elsewhere too or just in the .data() ?
[10:58:29] <shoky> and what are you using this for anyway
[10:58:44] <shoky> what's the relation between the 2 elements
[10:58:52] <WhirledPress> I should really be more comfortable with js. I am preloading a bunch of images and then attaching them after they all successfully load.
[10:59:46] <WhirledPress> so I thought it would be good to store a reference to their intended destination in each one and then distribute them once they were all loaded
[10:59:56] <taplar> not sure you have to do that.  loaded images would be in the browser cache from that point onwards, so later when you display them they should be there
[11:00:12] <taplar> afaik
[11:01:01] <WhirledPress> But if 3 of the 5 images load, I don't keep any of them.
[11:01:18] <taplar> they'll be in cache wither you keep the object or not
[11:02:51] <shoky> why do you need to "distribute" them?
[11:02:52] <WhirledPress> So my thought was this: each testimonial has 5 images in it. A thumb, and basically 2 views (bg image and fg image). So I figured I would load each image only if the previous one didn't fail. As soon as one failed, I would quit loading
[11:02:56] <shoky> why aren't they already there to begin with
[11:03:33] <WhirledPress> So I load them without attaching them until I am sure they all work.
[11:03:52] <shoky> any reason for that?
[11:04:05] <WhirledPress> I thought this would be the most effective way to avoid loading a ton of broken testimonials.
[11:04:30] <shoky> why would they be broken :S
[11:04:37] <WhirledPress> These people have thousands of images and though I have tried to rename them for easy loading, it's proving to be a nightmare
[11:05:11] <WhirledPress> They didn't use any convention for the naming and they manually created dreamweaver pages for each one. Some look okay, but all are a mess.
[11:05:14] <shoky> sounds like that's where you should be spending your time then,  not making your own preloader from scratch ;p
[11:06:46] <taplar> thousands of images for testimonials...
[11:07:05] <WhirledPress> So I have most of them named like test_3_thumb.png  and just wanted to make a factory that loaded these sequentially.I'll just store the ID of the destination and show you what I've got. If you think it's a mess (which I am sure it is), I'll go back to dreamweaver and keep fixing them.
[11:07:32] <shoky> also if you do it like you said you're just making the images loading much slower, as they won't download in parallel
[11:07:40] <WhirledPress> They sell llamas. Thousands and thousands of llamas. It's a nightmare
[11:08:13] <taplar> llama testimonials?
[11:08:28] <WhirledPress> owner testiomnials about their purchases of llamas
[11:08:32] <shoky> "It really whips the llama's ass"
[11:08:36] <WhirledPress> I haven't even started the llama gallery's
[11:09:09] <jerit> what key has keycode 27?
[11:09:10] <taplar> lol, it's just confusing me.  if you don't believe the site after three or four testimonials, what are the others going to do?
[11:09:19] <WhirledPress> They have terabytes of really awful and cheesy llama pictures that they made on instagram...hearts and things. bleck
[11:09:32] <shoky> jerit: i believe google knows. but uhh ESC iirc
[11:10:22] <jerit> shoky would you believe I'm on keycode.info and I've been pressing buttons for the last 5 minutes?
[11:10:37] <WhirledPress> taplar, it's like this. You go to buy a lamma, they want previous owner testimonials for it. sometimes there are 3 or 4
[11:10:43] <WhirledPress> per llama
[11:10:49] <taplar> why not bind to document keydown and echo e.which? jerit
[11:11:03] <taplar> -_-
[11:11:04] <jerit> now I have to wonder, why there would be an onkeypress function in my contractors code that redirects the user to <?php echo base_url(); ?> if the Esc key is pressed
[11:11:25] <jerit> taplar there is such a binding but I'm trying to understand why it exists
[11:11:44] <taplar> i was meaning more for determining which key it was
[11:11:47] <taplar> 27
[11:11:56] <shoky> or.. google?
[11:12:03] <jerit> taplar, this is in my code
[11:12:03] <jerit> http://pastebin.com/BG5FNWgd
[11:12:25] <taplar> shoky sure, i was just responding to his 5 minute statement, :)
[11:12:35] <WhirledPress> so you could press esc to go to the home page
[11:12:40] <shoky> yah that was directed at him ;p
[11:13:02] <taplar> if that's what 27 is, sure
[11:13:14] <jerit> WhirledPress except base_url() is not the home page, its another website entirely
[11:13:40] <jerit> lemme start at the beginning...
[11:14:11] * WhirledPress pulls out a chair and grabs some coffee...
[11:14:28] <jerit> when I got to the website (my contractor wrote this), its supposed to load http://my_server_ip/website ... instead it loads http://remote_url_to_production_server/
[11:14:47] <shoky> "it" ?
[11:15:08] <jerit> when I browse to http://my_server_up/website I get the remote url instead
[11:15:23] <jerit> its actually redirecting me to the value of base_url
[11:15:25] <shoky> then there's a redirect
[11:15:33] <jerit> yes and this is the only one http://pastebin.com/BG5FNWgd
[11:15:41] <jerit> I don't know why my contractor did this
[11:15:50] <shoky> there can be redirects on the server-side too, not just client..
[11:15:52] <jerit> so trying to figure it out myself since he's not answering skype
[11:15:55] <shoky> check your network tab
[11:16:08] <shoky> make sure you "Preserve log"
[11:16:50] <shoky> from googling it looks like base_url() gives you the directory you are currenty in..
[11:17:10] <WhirledPress> so you have a website at 333.333.333.3333/website/index.html and instead you are getting 333.333.333.3333/index.html ?
[11:17:12] <shoky> so if you're on  http://foo/bar.php   it'll give you  http://foo
[11:18:07] <taplar> weird, i'm not finding it in the php docs
[11:19:14] <WhirledPress> looks like a drupal thing, maybe
[11:20:27] <jerit> shoky, in /sma/config/config.php, $config['base_url'] = 'http://imaj.plootopos.com';
[11:20:41] <shoky> codeigniter, looks like
[11:20:43] <jerit> ya
[11:20:59] <jerit> here's network tab -> http://i.imgur.com/YVp7bQe.png
[11:21:14] <shoky> 301 and 302 are redirects
[11:21:15] <jerit> I don't understand; if I'm requesting SiteA why immediately redirect to SiteB?
[11:21:27] <shoky> because the server is telling the browser to redirect
[11:21:38] <shoky> that's what 301 and 302 mean
[11:24:24] <WhirledPress> Sounds like your developer isnt doing anything nefarious, but you don't trust him and he won't reply, hire someone else.
[11:28:54] <jimsgems> hey! I don't really know any JS, but how do I pass values like this:  combineitems(droppable.data("item-type"),  draggable.data("item-type") ,"camohat");  to ajax fn, where the data has been set in js?
[11:29:54] <jimsgems> I guess what im asking is why isnt it taking the values in?
[11:30:34] <jimsgems> total nube. I know
[11:30:42] <arc_> what is combineitems
[11:31:16] <jimsgems> it's a fn. What im really doing is a rails app, but I have to feed it with ajax
[11:31:19] <arc_> is that the function you're trying to "pass" this data to
[11:31:25] <jimsgems> yes
[11:31:36] <arc_> you don't have to pass data
[11:31:45] <arc_> you set them and they are available in any scope after they are set
[11:31:55] <arc_> it becomes attached to the element in dom
[11:32:25] <jimsgems> u want a gist? i ll do a gist. Im not sure i getcha
[11:33:11] <arc_> the question is are you sure those are set
[11:34:46] <jimsgems> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1bd1e319d864c4b62eeef2d7aaa5a37d
[11:34:58] <jimsgems> i believe i set them with a json string
[11:35:27] <jimsgems> not 101% sure though
[11:36:16] <jimsgems>  my rails code is squeaky clean,
[11:37:59] <jimsgems> arc_: I can give u the whole file, but i think that would bore and possibly anger you
[11:38:26] <arc_> just console.log these values you are trying to retreive and see what it says
[11:41:32] <jerit> WhirledPress its not that I don't trust him, its that work needs to be done and he's not around to do it, so I'm trying to do it myself, but ... actually I just had an idea
[11:42:05] <arc_> jimsgems i have a feeling you are not having a problem with passing values but that the values you are trying to pass are not what you think they are
[11:42:43] <jerit> my idea worked... I set the base_url to my server's ip address and it sort of worked
[11:42:46] <jimsgems> arc_: u may be right.
[11:43:16] <jerit> only problem is the website isn't in http://server_ip/ but in http://server_ip/website but I think that's a relatively easy fix too
[11:43:36] <arc_> so did you try to console.log the values?
[11:44:00] <jimsgems> yes i put in console.log, where is the output supposed to be?
[11:44:23] <arc_> the console log is in the developer tools of your browser
[11:44:37] <jimsgems> console.log(draggable.data("item-type")) that is
[11:44:54] <arc_> the console is like a terminal for websites
[11:45:58] <PCatinean> Hey guys, how does one list all the available variables in the scope using the debugger?
[11:46:16] <jimsgems> im looking at it. what collumn should it be in?
[11:46:24] <arc_> what browser are you in
[11:46:30] <jimsgems> firefox
[11:46:39] <jimsgems> i can do chrome
[11:46:46] <arc_> there should be a tab called 'console'
[11:47:09] <arc_> which may be blank so you would have to refresh the page to see the output
[11:47:29] <jimsgems> there is. there are tabs within it called js, net, css ...
[11:47:45] <PCatinean> any1?
[11:47:47] <arc_> you should enable js
[11:47:47] <PCatinean> chromium here
[11:51:51] <jimsgems> arc_: not showing them. My objects have dissappeared though. This was part of the funciton, but was only supposed to happen when they were combined adn the result put in their stead
[11:53:10] <jimsgems> im gonna, put the objects back and try again
[12:12:15] <jimsgems> arc_: I got it, thanks arc_ . It was a syntax error (actually several of them!!!!)
[12:16:39] <lulul> guys why is my ajax post always sends data as url params ? http://notey.it/n/dGRm
[12:20:57] <jerit> lulul you're not specifying method: 'POST'
[12:21:17] <jerit> it defaults to GET so it'll always send as url params
[12:21:40] <jerit> http://notey.it/n/dGRn
[13:35:42] <scrupul0usOTG> hello, how would i modify the padding for body that has a class 'home' where in the stylesheet is defined body.hom
[13:44:27] <WhirledPress> I think it was last seen in #css
[14:37:26] <WhirledPress> So without preloading images, how do I determine if images haven't loaded?
[15:20:51] <maxpen> guys what is wrong with this? https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/fe64qv4p/
[15:23:28] <maxpen> I mean this https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/fe64qv4p/1/
[15:33:30] <systemfault> maxpen: You cannot expect .text() to return the same thing, that's very bad code.
[15:33:41] <maxpen> hmmm
[15:33:43] <maxpen> then what do I do?
[15:33:45] <systemfault> maxpen: Just for fun, console.log the length of the two strings
[15:34:04] <maxpen> can you edit what you mean?
[15:34:08] <maxpen> I'm tired
[15:34:11] <systemfault> https://jsfiddle.net/fe64qv4p/2/
[15:34:47] <maxpen> I get 46
[15:34:49] <maxpen> and 47
[15:34:52] <systemfault> Exactly.
[15:34:58] <maxpen> no idea what that means lol
[15:35:07] <maxpen> how to make it hide the h1
[15:35:17] <maxpen> how to make this run  if (checkpublish === "This Username Exists, please pick another one!") {
[15:35:41] <systemfault> checkpublish and ""This Username Exists, please pick another one!"  have different sizes.. how can you expect them to be the same?
[15:36:23] <systemfault> maxpen: Where does string "This Username Exists, please pick another one!" come from?
[15:36:27] <systemfault> In your actual code
[15:36:40] <systemfault> Not on the example you wrote
[15:36:55] <maxpen> well if the username is a duplicate
[15:36:57] <maxpen> it shows that
[15:37:01] <maxpen> in Wordpress
[15:37:11] <maxpen> and if that happens I want to disable the submit buttton
[15:37:40] <systemfault> maxpen: Ok, so there's no "nice solution",  the best one would be a regex
[15:38:03] <maxpen> no nice solution? but we are in jquery lol
[15:38:12] <maxpen> jquery was made for nice solutions
[15:38:21] <maxpen> how hard can it be to match the text inside the span
[15:38:24] <maxpen> with the if
[15:39:07] <systemfault> maxpen: Give me a minute, I'll show you something.
[15:39:14] <maxpen> great
[15:39:30] <systemfault> maxpen: There's no "nice" solution not because of jQuery but because it would involve changes to the HTML/WP
[15:40:08] <maxpen> what changes would that be?
[15:40:17] <maxpen> I'm using a plugin in wich I do all my custom code
[15:40:28] <maxpen> I got a js file loaded on the right screen
[15:40:34] <maxpen> all I need is a working piece of jquery code
[15:40:44] <systemfault> maxpen: https://jsfiddle.net/fe64qv4p/3/
[15:40:59] <systemfault> maxpen Would that work for you?
[15:41:24] <maxpen> I will try it out now and let you know
[15:41:30] <systemfault> Cool
[15:45:16] <maxpen> systemfault it worked!
[15:45:21] <systemfault> Great!
[15:45:23] <maxpen> genius!!!!!!!
[15:45:29] <maxpen> GENIUS
[15:45:31] <systemfault> And because it's a regex, it's slightly less bad
[15:45:33] <maxpen> hours I spent
[15:45:37] <maxpen> to figure this out
[15:45:37] <systemfault> Glad you got it fixed :)
[15:45:39] <maxpen> man my head
[15:45:46] <systemfault> I know how JS can be...
[15:46:57] <maxpen> indeed
[16:10:24] <WhirledPress> So how do I tell if all of my images load correctly without a preloader?
[16:10:49] <drej> you guess
[16:11:17] <WhirledPress> drats! back to using a preloader. lol
[18:47:55] <p0000> I'm trying to save my resized jquery-ui accordion handles to localstorage: http://pastebin.com/w0K6B5hS (line 55) so when the page reloads is positions correctly. Is there any documentation about this? I didnt see anything on the website.
[18:48:09] <p0000> -it positions
[21:25:01] <WhirledPress> anybody know of a simple sequential animation plugin? I need to animate one element and then another and then a third and I would like to do it sequentially.
[21:52:59] <D-rex> WhirledPress: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.queue/
[21:55:07] <WhirledPress> Thanks, Ill check it out. I wish someone would port the ancient Fuse library to jquery.
[21:56:21] <WhirledPress> is .queue still a thing? I thought it was deprecated.
[22:45:13] <WhirledPress> if you assign css to an element using jquery and you include css transitions, will it work?
[23:02:24] <D-rex> WhirledPress: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10237731/css3-transitions-inside-jquery-css
[23:05:07] <lonewaft> anyone have any idea how to get a jquery-ui slider to stay on the same height as the label? no matter what i do, the label seems to be over the slider
[23:20:51] <WhirledPress> D-rex, sorry I blocked stackoverflow from search results. thanks. Ill check it out.
[23:21:10] <WhirledPress> lonewaft, what do you mean by height? the height of the elements?
[23:21:30] <WhirledPress> lonewaft, can you make a fiddle of it?
[23:37:39] <lonewaft> whirledpress : https://jsfiddle.net/wetobdre
[23:51:34] <graphettion> lonewaft, don't cross post and this is more a CSS issue
