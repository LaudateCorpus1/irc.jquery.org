[02:07:46] <jop008> I want to find out if user clicked cancel or add
[02:09:00] <Woet> put the onclick on the actions instead?
[02:09:22] <jop008> found alert(event.target.id);
[02:09:41] <jop008> more generic code less code on the parent
[02:42:24] <Legie> hello, is anybody around who can help me out with little thing in jQuery? I already make button to switch div`s, but the problem is that in the 2nd div with google map doesnt show me the map. It works before since i just script for hide/show divs. Does anybody know? Thanks
[04:04:16] <paulvd> hello, what is this error related to ? JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data at line 1 column 200 of the JSON data
[04:05:17] <basiclaser> hey guys I have a tricky js-injection / css animation bug for you :) How can I make the lines print out in descending order instead of pushing eachother? http://jsbin.com/kevuti/1/edit
[04:05:36] <basiclaser> Could I fix that with jquery? or is it a problem inherent with injecting html?
[04:07:53] <K3|Chris> pushing each other?
[04:10:49] <K3|Chris> basiclaser: you have a very long list of options I think if the problem is just their order, either fixed position, or populate the paragraph tags first in the right order and then fill them or just change where you insert the HTML
[04:11:05] <K3|Chris> end of container or after first paragraph when starting second etc
[04:12:05] <basiclaser> K3|Chris: Hey there, I did initially try fixed and absolute, no dice
[04:12:45] <K3|Chris> should work fine as long as you don't create the paragraphs after page load
[04:13:01] <K3|Chris> if you do you need to apply that styling after you create them
[04:13:29] <basiclaser> K3|Chris: sorry, allow me to elaborate. . . I made a plugin which modifies facebook. This is injected after the page loads.
[04:13:40] * K3|Chris runs away screaming
[04:13:45] <basiclaser> :D
[04:14:05] <basiclaser> so yeh im not in control of any normal html tags, injection is my only avenue
[04:14:21] <K3|Chris> well you can still apply css using jQ/JS right?
[04:14:55] <K3|Chris> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:14:59] <basiclaser> yes, thats no problem. The css sheet you see in that JSbin is successfully loaded and applied when the html is eventually injected
[04:15:37] <K3|Chris> can manipulate css on a more granular level
[04:15:46] <K3|Chris> can apply the properties you want when you want them
[04:16:07] <K3|Chris> that's what you need to do generally speaking with dynamic content
[04:16:07] <basiclaser> ooh i think i got it! What if i inject the first line to the end of the body,and then the second line to the end of the first line? :D
[04:16:22] <K3|Chris> that's one option I mentioned yes
[04:17:26] <steven> does anyone know a plugin that smooths mousewheel scrolling? kinda need it to behave like using the scrollbar
[04:24:21] <lacrymology> hello, I'm trying to implement soring with jquery-ui.sortable(). I'm sorting a linear list, isn't there an event that will come with.. well, the old and new index? Because from what I see on the docs, I only get an x-y position
[04:26:54] <basiclaser> K3|Chris: sorry i thought i'd just share with you, the problem of text printing out 'upwards' instead of 'western style' was solved by injecting 'beforbegin' instead of 'afterend' as a position
[04:39:07] <lacrymology> is there a less silly way of doing this: ui.item.parent().children().index(ui.item)  ??
[04:54:28] <marknew> hi
[04:54:31] <marknew> sorry
[04:55:17] <marknew> can i ask about sliding 3 divs with separate links
[04:55:30] <basiclaser> do not ask to ask
[04:55:34] <basiclaser> jus ask
[04:55:37] <marknew> sorry
[04:55:42] <basiclaser> and dont be sorry
[04:55:43] <marknew> just new

[04:58:23] <cdkdang> help please.
[04:58:37] <cdkdang> having trouble looping through json results
[04:59:16] <lacrymology> cdkdang: what kind of trouble? be more specific,please? what are you doing?
[04:59:48] <lacrymology> Legie: how did it "work before"? before what?
[05:00:21] <lacrymology> Legie: IIRC, google maps creates the map with the original size of the container, so if you're creating it while it's hidden, it's very probable that that's your problem right there
[05:00:32] <cdkdang> [{"label":"abc","desc":"alphabet","row0":{"first":"a","second":"b","third":"c"},"row1":{"first":"x","second":"y","third":"z"}}]
[05:00:52] <lacrymology> cdkdang: how is that a jQuery object? looks like an array to me
[05:01:07] <lacrymology> cdkdang: sorry. json, not jquery. My bad
[05:01:14] <lacrymology> cdkdang: so what's your problem?
[05:02:01] <cdkdang> lacrymology. how do i access row0[first] then row1[first] with javascript?
[05:02:25] <cdkdang> using jquery autocomplete
[05:02:39] <cdkdang> php script gives me results in above format
[05:02:51] <cdkdang> jquery autocomplete can get "a"
[05:03:15] <cdkdang> using vf.item.row0.first
[05:03:23] <cdkdang> and "x"
[05:03:29] <cdkdang> using vf.item.row1.first
[05:03:42] <cdkdang> how do i loop through
[05:03:51] <lacrymology> that sounds like a really silly way of doing that, IMO
[05:03:58] <cdkdang> eg vf.item.row[i].first
[05:04:12] <lacrymology> cdkdang: you can do vf.item["row
[05:04:19] <lacrymology> cdkdang: you can do vf.item["row"+i].first
[05:04:46] <lacrymology> the problem is that you don't really have a count for how many "rowX" you have, do you?
[05:04:47] <cdkdang> ah okay thanks will try that right now
[05:05:05] <cdkdang> i do have count in vf.item.count
[05:05:14] <cdkdang> just not shown in simplified example
[05:05:17] <cdkdang> thanks heaps
[05:05:18] <lacrymology> ok
[05:05:19] <lacrymology> good luck
[05:05:20] <cdkdang> lacrymology
[05:05:31] <cdkdang> you the best
[05:05:43] <lacrymology> cdkdang: a question for #javascript rather than here, though
[05:07:33] <Legie> lacrymology : before i used script for show/hide divs it shows both maps. div was just beneath it. now i have one div hidden and using script to show 2nd div (and picture from google map doesnt load all image) if you understand me. Iam trying to ask if its posible that when i use script for show/hide divs can damage google maps image. If i need to reload it again or something. Because contain of both divs shows good, just map dont show wh
[05:08:00] <cdkdang> lacrymology: worked like a charm champ!
[05:08:09] <cdkdang> will try to ask in the right channel next time
[05:08:11] <cdkdang> cye
[05:08:12] <cdkdang> bye

[10:05:17] <OnceMe> <a href="#" class="whatset" id="index"></a>
[10:05:22] <phelix> I am using jquery so that when you scroll the down or up on the wheel that it srolls the page horizontally. This works fine. Is what I am trying to do though is change the background position depending if you scroll up or down on the wheel. Anyone able to help me figure that out?
[10:05:26] <OnceMe> var WHAT = $('.whatset').attr("id");
[10:05:30] <OnceMe> that WHAT is never set, why?
[10:07:00] <OnceMe> nvm
[10:14:26] <Operaiter> hey i got some informations via ajax and append them to my body element.  in another script i want to iterate over all elements by using each triggerd by pushing a button. but each dont see my dynamic add elements :/ may you have a hint for me?
[10:18:06] <Operaiter> sorry... there is some code for you :)
[10:18:07] <Operaiter> http://nopaste.eisscholle.net/index.php?id=ea24cf3225
[10:20:16] <phelix> Anyone know how to change the background position on mouse wheel scroll?
[10:21:33] <Operaiter> what do you mean phelix ?
[10:22:21] <phelix> I want to increase background positions up if scrolling up and down if scolling down
[10:22:45] <phelix> http://www.mindimage.net/
[10:23:32] <phelix> you can see small example here.. that image of those black lines is set to background.. when your browser is going left or right I want to change and update the background positioning. I have it so it works one direction. just can't get it to subtract again when going the other direction
[10:25:21] <Operaiter> it works in both directions by me? :)
[10:25:35] <phelix> yes but it keeps subtracting no matter what direction you are going
[10:25:42] <phelix> one direction it needs to add and the other subtract
[10:26:20] <Operaiter> sounds weired ;) sorry i've totaly no idear. but i'm a bloody beginner :P
[10:26:58] <phelix> dang.. i have it working one direction. Just need to figure out how to make it work in the other
[10:38:59] <aphorise> How can I trigger: input[type="text"]:valid after doing my checks on related input field?
[11:34:51] <phelix> this seems to work with the first element in the background-position: anyone know how I can modify this so that it also adds to the second background-postion ?
[12:36:38] <OnceMe> hello something is wrong
[12:36:39] <OnceMe> data: "lastmsg="+ID+"&what="+WHAT,
[12:37:04] <OnceMe> I send that via ajax and when I check if ($_POST['real']) == real it's not.
[12:39:03] <OnceMe> nvm
[12:40:02] <Arby01> conceptually, in mvc, if I have a handlebars template, a model.js, view.js and controller.js and depending on the browser device I want to change the html that "wraps" the template (in this case change a set of tabs to accordion and add an H3 some-title before the template) would the some-title variable exist in the controller or the view?
[13:34:34] <OnceMe> I have a small issue
[13:35:15] <OnceMe> when I call ajax call inside form which is also have ajax, I get outer ajax call
[13:37:29] <OnceMe> any help?
[13:39:26] <OnceMe> or better how do I select whole form except one part inside form?
[13:39:59] <OnceMe> nvm :not saved me
[14:39:18] <OnceMe> :not does not work
[14:40:34] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/MZ3XLLDS
[14:40:35] <OnceMe> why?
[14:45:02] <OnceMe> HALP
[14:45:10] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: That's not how that would work.
[14:45:36] <BillCriswell> All that :not would do there is if it was on the <form> element it wouldn't match it.
[14:52:07] <OnceMe> ah ok
[14:52:10] <OnceMe> so how to do it BillCriswell ?
[14:52:23] <BillCriswell> I don't understand what you're trying to do.
[14:52:24] <OnceMe> I'm clueless because I serialize data for form I have a lot of data
[14:52:47] <OnceMe> well I have inside <form> a hidden field which is visible on hover and a button to mark it as paid
[14:53:14] <OnceMe> and paid is input submit button inside another <form>
[14:54:00] <OnceMe> so I have form inside form, and I want <form class="superform> ..some data .. <form><input type="submit" name="paid"></form> </form>
[14:54:15] <OnceMe> so that second form is not selected by superform.form
[14:54:24] <OnceMe> I tried
[14:54:30] <BillCriswell> You're nesting forms? You sure that works?
[14:54:45] <OnceMe> <form class="superform> ..some data .. <div id="k"><form><input type="submit" name="paid"></form></div> </form>
[14:54:50] <OnceMe> and so :not(#k)
[14:54:54] <OnceMe> but that does not work
[14:55:26] <OnceMe> well yes I am nesting forms
[14:55:35] <BillCriswell> You can't nest forms.
[14:57:19] <OnceMe> eh
[14:59:32] <OnceMe> so how to do a visible trick with css only
[14:59:39] <OnceMe> if I put form outside of the box
[15:00:40] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: I'm not sure I'm following what you're trying to do.
[15:00:51] <BillCriswell> Do you have a demo somewhere or can you mock something up at jsbin.com ?
[15:03:29] <OnceMe> hmm better simpler question
[15:03:39] <OnceMe> is there a way for me to send ajax call based on a link
[15:03:53] <OnceMe> so <A href="#" id="1"></a>
[15:03:59] <OnceMe> so I send ID = 1 via ajax
[15:04:10] <OnceMe> its easier for me and everything else since its only one
[15:04:18] <OnceMe> object.
[15:05:57] <OnceMe> BillCriswell: ?
[15:06:36] <BillCriswell> You should use a number as id. You should probably do like data-id="1" then you can do like $('a').on('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); var $link = $(this); $.get($link.prop('href'), { id: $link.data('id') }).done(function() { /* All done (/ }); });
[15:07:23] <OnceMe> cool llet me test
[15:07:30] <OnceMe> where is ajax call actually?
[15:07:44] <BillCriswell> $.get() would be the ajax call.
[15:08:01] <OnceMe> I need to send data
[15:08:04] <OnceMe> via POST method
[15:08:17] <OnceMe> eh I need form
[15:08:47] <BillCriswell> I'd need to see what you're doing. If you can set up a demo at jsbin or something I can help more.
[15:08:55] <OnceMe> its very hard
[15:09:03] <OnceMe> its written all in OOP and its very complex
[15:27:37] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Okie doke.
[15:29:34] <aphorise> Is 	$("#my_form").validate(...)   part of jquery? - not sure why I am getting "is not a function"
[15:32:24] <BillCriswell> aphorise: It's a plugin.
[15:32:38] <BillCriswell> so it wouldn't be available with just jQuery by itself.
[15:32:46] <aphorise> BillCriswell  thx
[15:34:26] <pycasso> how do I disable click event in a mouseover function?
[15:48:12] <BillCriswell> pycasso: How would that situation come up?
[15:49:40] <pycasso> i have a product gallery that will load an image into a div on mouseover, however if users click the a link with send them to the full image
[15:49:57] <pycasso> the a link is used as a fallback if javascript is disabled
[15:59:04] <pycasso> BillCriswell:http://jsfiddle.net/nz83hep3/2/
[16:01:38] <pycasso> BillCriswell: better example http://jsfiddle.net/nz83hep3/3/
[16:03:56] <BillCriswell> pycasso: So when you mouseover the link it just updated another image, and when you click you don't want anything to happen?
[16:04:45] <pycasso> correct
[16:05:39] <pycasso> or would it be better to save the hassle. and just use a click?
[16:06:03] <pycasso> mobile users can't mouseover any way...
[16:07:15] <BillCriswell> pycasso: Yes.
[16:07:19] <BillCriswell> I'd just go with the click.
[16:08:27] <pycasso> thanks
[16:15:50] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[16:20:52] <axilla> we have a pizza place here called piecasso

[16:24:52] <Tomashe> hey guys i got something weird going on , when i do object = Container.children("#chats").find(".chats[data-id='"+value.id+"']"); i got  am assive object that basicly go tthe CHATS innerHTML inside and alot of other things
[16:25:03] <Tomashe> any idea why i can not jut catch what i wanted ?
[16:25:14] <Tomashe> which is the .chats[data-id='"+value.id+"']
[16:27:54] <Tomashe> i got something like that when i console.log object [prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: ".chats[data-id='8']", jquery: "2.1.0", constructor: function…]...
[16:32:13] <shoky_> Tomashe: that's what a jquery object looks like, what's wrong with it
[16:33:29] <Tomashe> im tryign to only select the .chats['data...
[16:33:55] <shoky_> that's what you're doing
[16:34:05] <shoky_> what makes you think it's not selecting that
[16:34:31] <Tomashe> cuz its exists and it still give me 0 on length
[16:35:02] <shoky_> then either it doesn't exist when you're doing that selection, or the selector is wrong somewhere
[16:35:17] <Tomashe> ok let me recheck
[16:36:33] <Tomashe> nop it exists and still give me 0 wierd
[16:36:45] <Tomashe> maybe cuz im doing live page updates
[16:36:49] <shoky_> make a jsfiddle if ya need more help with it. btw also check if just the .children("#chats") finds anything
[16:37:51] <Tomashe> chhats give me 1 which is ok
[16:39:29] <aphorise> Its very fragile & over-weighted that validate()
[17:22:17] <Appleman1234> Hi
[17:24:12] <Appleman1234> I have a perl script I am calling using .ajax, The perl script works find when called from the command line, and it works when I change the data type to html and add the relevant html header and footer in the perl script
[17:24:50] <Appleman1234> But when the data type is set to plain text, the data is returned is empty ?
[17:28:45] <skyjumper> hello all
[17:28:57] <skyjumper> looking for an alternative to jquery-tools scrollable
[17:29:00] <skyjumper> since it seems to be abandoned
[17:33:18] <YammYcoding> in a single word how .foo .bar could be? .foo.bar is the same?
[17:33:45] <tw2113> first one has bar being a descendent class of a dom element with a class of foo
[17:33:47] <YammYcoding> or .foo+.bar ?
[17:33:55] <tw2113> second one has them being on the same element
[17:34:11] <tw2113> <div class="foo"><span class="bar"></span></div>
[17:34:12] <YammYcoding> i want it descendent but can't use them separated
[17:34:13] <tw2113> vs
[17:34:25] <tw2113> <div class="foo bar"></div>
[17:34:39] <YammYcoding> jquery param needs 1 item without spaces
[17:34:51] <YammYcoding> can i get to .bar somehow?
[17:35:05] <YammYcoding> .foo>.bar or something?
[17:35:57] <tw2113> huh
[17:36:05] <red> typical css selector .foo.bar ?
[17:36:18] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/powiz/1/edit
[17:36:20] <YammYcoding> but is .foo.bar same as .foo .bar ?
[17:36:23] <red> or .foo > .bar if you want to select any .bars under .foo
[17:36:23] <tw2113> no
[17:36:27] <tw2113> i already explained why
[17:36:35] <tw2113> the space means descendent
[17:36:40] <tw2113> no space means the same element
[17:36:51] <tw2113> .foo.bar = <div class="foo bar"></div>
[17:36:56] <YammYcoding> can write .foo>.bar ?
[17:37:08] <tw2113> that would make it a direct descendent
[17:37:26] <tw2113> <div class="foo"><span class="bar"></span></div> would still match
[17:37:36] <YammYcoding> it's the button from youtube play it has generic name
[17:37:38] <tw2113> but <div class="foo"><span class="bar"><span class="bar"></span></span></div>
[17:37:40] <tw2113> would not
[17:37:48] <tw2113> at least if you were trying to select the most nested one
[17:38:19] <YammYcoding> the play button is waaaaay down the tree after tons of tags
[17:38:27] <tw2113> so don't use a >
[17:38:31] <YammYcoding> the foo is the outer div containing it
[17:38:42] <tw2113> .foo .whateverclassisontheplaybutton
[17:38:48] <YammYcoding> then inpossible? without space?
[17:38:52] <tw2113> yes
[17:38:59] <YammYcoding> damit =)
[17:39:01] <tw2113> don't exclude the space
[17:39:15] <tw2113> the space is needed
[17:39:23] <tw2113> and why are you saying damnit to that?
[17:39:37] <YammYcoding> cause i can pass only 1 item
[17:39:57] <tw2113> not following
[17:39:57] <YammYcoding> to the jquery code
[17:40:58] <YammYcoding> i'm trying to track video play events for analytics.
[17:41:02] <tw2113> ".foo .bar" is only one selector
[17:41:12] <YammYcoding> there is a plugin that expects a class name. but not with spaces.
[17:41:21] <tw2113> what a shitty plugin then
[17:41:27] <YammYcoding> :/
[17:43:11] <tw2113> if you want to track clicks on play buttons, just do a click handler callback that runs the analytics tracker function
[17:52:30] <YammYcoding> if I put the video inside a div, and set a click event to the div, can it behave like a click on the video?
[17:52:52] <YammYcoding> maybe with a display block or something
[18:09:22] <tw2113> i don't see what's stopping you from making your selector select the video itself and when you click on it
[18:13:00] <tw2113> $('.foo .bar').on('click',function(){ _paq.push(['trackPageView']); });
[18:13:16] <YammYcoding> tried that but didn't work
[18:13:45] <tw2113> not sure exactly how instantanious it's going to show up in your reports
[18:14:01] <YammYcoding> the video is embedded, that goes in iframe and yada yada yada can't select the video
[18:14:28] <tw2113> so it's a case of you're not selecting it properly because iframes are a bitch
[18:14:35] <YammYcoding> indeed ><
[18:15:04] <YammYcoding> i tried wraping the entire video in a div #foo, and tried the event on that, but didn't work :(
[18:15:19] <YammYcoding> unless i have to somehow say the div is clickable
[18:15:22] <tw2113> i think the iframe is going to be the biggest issue, not wrapper divs
[18:15:33] <sky> I'm confused. I have some json code returning {"balance":"5.00"}, in my ajax success I have alert(data.balance) showing 5.00, but when I try to do return data.balance I get undefined
[18:28:55] <Utils> Should be a simple issue. I have a <canvas></canvas> and I'm accessing the element in javascript $("canvas")[0] but when I call .toDataUrl() it will say that udnefined is not a function
[18:29:09] <Utils> canvas.toDataUrl should exist, but it doesn't. It's odd behavior.
[18:30:04] <Utils> I've verified that $("canvas")[0] exists, I did console.dir($("canvas")[0]); but toDataUrl() doesn't.
[18:30:29] <Utils> Oh!
[18:30:32] <Utils> Case sensitive.
[18:46:09] <Horacsio> hello?
[18:46:43] * skyjumper hears an echo
[19:07:55] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/v667fys0/ could some help me checking the if statement? this is using http://jqueryvalidation.org/valid from validation plugin.
[19:42:39] <YammYcoding> jQuery(".embedded-video").click( function() { _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Videos', 'Play', 'VideoFoo']);	} );
[19:42:46] <YammYcoding> why this don't work? :(
[19:43:11] <YammYcoding> for <div class=".embedded-video"><iframe youtube crap></div>
[20:00:00] <trevlar> YammYcoding: 2 reasons... 1) get rid of the dot in your class attribute. and 2) your site has no way of knowing what a user is doing inside another site's iframe on your page
[20:02:47] <YammYcoding> hmm
[20:02:51] <YammYcoding> so is impossible?
[20:03:25] <YammYcoding> there is no dot, i typo
[20:04:33] <trevlar> YammYcoding: yep. cannot be done with an iframe
[20:04:43] <trevlar> but youtube has a javascript api https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference
[20:07:27] <YammYcoding> here is what i'm trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/d199bzkk/

[21:09:37] <andrewSC> hi all
[21:10:51] <andrewSC> is it a best practice for a keypress listener to check the integer value stored in the event's 'which' property? I know the docs say that jquery normalizes input but I'm not sure if there was a best practice than doing a switch or if statement on just integer comparisons
[21:20:03] <yuung> is there a way to set an svg paths' stroke value to 'initial', like in css?
[21:20:10] <yuung> in my jquery, i'm changing the path stroke value to gray on hover; then i'd like to revert back to whatever it was originally
[21:20:18] <yuung> in my jquery, i'm changing the path stroke value to gray on hover; then i'd like to revert back to whatever it was originallyhowever when i try $("path").attr("stroke", "initial"), the paths go blank (presumably white; their original colors were red)
[21:20:35] <yuung> (more of an svg question than jquery, but #svg isn't very active)
[21:42:39] <wa5ted> yuung: why not directly set it to #ff0000
[21:42:42] <wa5ted> or what ever red you are using
[21:42:54] <wa5ted> its a jquery question but its svg manipulation
