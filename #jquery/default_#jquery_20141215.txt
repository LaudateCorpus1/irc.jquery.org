[00:14:56] <K4T> Sometimes I can see on web generated docs in html with blue sidebar on the left with search box inside on top of that sidebar. Who recognize it? I am searchign for tool which can generate docs like that for me.
[01:18:02] <mooncup> .not appears to not be working when another selector is passed in
[01:18:08] <mooncup> can it be used like this?
[01:19:32] <blackkbot> how?
[01:20:41] <blackkbot> $('*:not(*:hover)') gets all elements not being hovered
[01:20:58] <mooncup> 1 sec
[01:21:53] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/qvs1mozoyjpa1tsf5rwta
[01:22:00] <mooncup> the first one doesn't work, but the second one does
[01:24:10] <blackkbot> are you trying to hide all the elements that are not the closest one to it
[01:24:12] <blackkbot> ?
[01:24:43] <mooncup> I'm trying to hide all elements that arent its parent
[01:24:50] <mooncup> but $(this).parents() wasn't working either
[01:25:01] <mooncup> by parent I mean a few levels up, not direct parent
[01:25:37] <blackkbot> so siblings
[01:26:13] <mooncup> no
[01:26:15] <mooncup> parents
[01:26:35] <Laban> parents and grandparents...
[01:26:44] <mooncup> yeah
[01:27:44] <blackkbot> $('.whole-table-container').not($(this).closest($('.whole-table-container'))).hide();
[01:27:48] <blackkbot> is what you did wrong
[01:28:06] <mooncup> $('.whole-table-container').not($(this).parents()).hide(); is what I had originally
[01:28:15] <mooncup> but I couldn't get that to work either
[01:28:18] <mooncup> it just hides all of them
[01:30:04] <blackkbot> ok so $('*').each(function(){if($(this).contains($('.whole-table-container')))$(this).hide();});
[01:30:30] <blackkbot> but thats all parents
[01:30:39] <blackkbot> including dom
[01:30:40] <blackkbot> hmm
[01:30:41] <blackkbot> lol
[01:30:53] <mooncup> yeah but that shouldn't matter in theory
[01:31:11] <mooncup> wait
[01:31:22] <mooncup> yeah that wouldn't work I odn't think
[01:31:37] <blackkbot> i don't think so
[01:32:08] <blackkbot> its all parents soo the parents would include html>body>etc...
[01:33:09] <Uhkis> how about making a fiddle so this makes some sort of sense?
[01:33:49] <mooncup> a fiddle seems a bit unecessary
[01:34:00] <blackkbot> http://jsfiddle.net/Darbicus/y8jww2pw/
[01:34:00] <mooncup> I just want to compress this into a single statement
[01:34:02] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/qvs1mozoyjpa1tsf5rwta
[01:34:03] <mooncup> the second one
[01:36:21] <Uhkis> why..?
[01:38:11] <mooncup> because hiding it then showing it is silly
[01:38:21] <mooncup> it would be better to only hide ones that aren't it
[01:40:28] <Uhkis> even sillier is wasting time on something pointless and probably slower ;-)
[01:40:49] <blackkbot> sillier is my middle name
[01:41:01] <blackkbot> black sillier kbot
[01:41:14] <Uhkis> nice to meet you!
[01:41:21] <blackkbot> lol
[01:41:32] <blackkbot> yeah its does seem pretty fruitless
[01:42:12] <blackkbot> but learning to use css selectors is fun i think
[01:46:03] <mooncup> it's more of a learning process
[01:46:14] <mooncup> if I always just do stuff the quick and dirty way I'll never improve
[01:46:30] <blackkbot> well theres more than one way to skin a cat
[01:51:52] <djlee> Hi all, hopefully this type of Q is allowed here :P I'm looking for a plugin or at least some explanation as to how i might achieve an inline autocomplete. For clarity, i have a list of "tags" which will be placeholders for "mail merging" real data (for example: "hello {username}"), and i have a <textbox> for entering some text, when someone types the "{" character, i'd like some helper list to popup that filters as the
[01:51:52] <djlee> y type.... any idea on where to start with this?
[01:53:21] <suspicious_ee> djlee: googling "jquery autocomplete" is a good start
[01:54:55] <djlee> suspicious_ee: tried that, but autocompleters seem to be about autocompleting the entire string. I want to autocomplete on a word by word basis (and yes im also googling, i just happened think an IRC help channel might be able to help too)
[01:57:06] <suspicious_ee> djlee: perhaps https://github.com/yuku-t/jquery-textcomplete
[01:58:11] <djlee> suspicious_ee: seems to do the job! thanks! (god knows what you googled for, i've been looking for 30 minutes)
[01:58:18] <suspicious_ee> :)
[01:59:56] <latemus> I need to write a function that will let me pass in a variable, and output this http://pastebin.com/fw92T40R , where the name of that id is the value of the variable i'm passing in. io think i have done it correctly here, ==> http://pastebin.com/tuB6eY9A am i right? and then i could just call printSpinner( p1-content );
[02:01:06] <Cork> latemus: $('#' + idVar)
[02:01:59] <Cork> es6 is getting template strings, before that you can to concat
[02:02:07] <Cork> *you have to use
[02:02:30] <latemus> Cork: Thank you. i see, that'll be awesome :)
[02:02:51] <latemus> Cork: Did I use return correctly?
[02:03:05] <Cork> no
[02:03:10] <latemus> or do i need to escape all those single quotes in there somehow
[02:03:12] <Cork> you're returning an empty block
[02:03:23] <Cork> your setting the content to an element
[02:03:31] <Cork> you aren't really returning anything
[02:03:45] <latemus> Cork: hmm
[02:03:46] <latemus> ok
[02:03:55] <Cork> what is it you want to return?
[02:04:09] <Cork> the element matching #<idVar> ?
[02:04:40] <Cork> latemus: also i recommend using ['', '', ''].join('')
[02:04:43] <Cork> instead of +
[02:04:47] <Cork> makes the code more readable
[02:04:54] <latemus> i want to generate the $("#idvar").html('...'); block of script, which will generate the markup
[02:05:10] <Cork> script??
[02:05:17] <latemus> yeah
[02:05:20] <Cork> its just strings of html
[02:05:23] <Cork> no scripts
[02:05:43] <latemus> ... i need to generate $("#idvar").html('...'); in many places in my script
[02:05:50] <latemus> with a different id each time
[02:06:08] <Cork> ok, so you want to generate a "wrapping element" and append the html to it
[02:06:12] <Cork> and then return the new element?
[02:06:18] <latemus> so i thought i would wrap it in a function, and just call the function to produce the content wherever i need it
[02:06:42] <latemus> Cork: Yeah, that's correct.
[02:06:49] <Cork> latemus: then you need to create the element
[02:06:56] <Cork> $('#') searches it doesn't create them
[02:07:15] <latemus> Cork: Ohhhh okay cool
[02:07:25] <Cork> return $('<div>', { id: idVar }).html(<html string>);
[02:07:33] <Cork> is what you want
[02:07:45] <Cork> or what element you want to use
[02:08:02] <latemus> Cork: Man, you are a wizard with shiny skills :)
[02:08:17] <latemus> Cork: thank you so much!
[02:08:21] <Cork> np
[02:08:43] <latemus> :) Awesome
[02:08:48] <mdunbavan1985> Hi, does anyone know why when using $.each and then inside that $.get for a set of data urls it keeps randomizing the order of the elements?
[02:09:15] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: the loop fires the requests
[02:09:35] <Cork> and then the callbacks fire as the answers come back (after the loop ends)
[02:09:45] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: yes, it grabs the urls and then uses a .each to append some data to a page
[02:10:02] <Cork> that isn't what i meant
[02:10:05] <Cork> the loop doesn't append them
[02:10:12] <Cork> the loop sends the requests to the server
[02:10:33] <Cork> as the server processes the requests, and the responses gets back over the network they fire "as they come"
[02:10:38] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: yes it does sorry
[02:10:58] <Cork> so depending on how long each request take to answer for the server
[02:11:10] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: but when I check the data urls being fired they are in the correct order
[02:11:14] <Cork> and on what route the package takes (and if there is a package loss) you get randomization
[02:11:31] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: yes, but as i just said, that isn't blocking
[02:11:39] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: so there is not much I can do with it?
[02:12:11] <Cork> you can chain them so the next one only fires as the first one is done (will slow things down)
[02:12:22] <Cork> or you can tag them and only append them when you have the previous answers
[02:12:28] <Cork> or...
[02:12:33] <Cork> there is many solutions
[02:12:58] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: shall I show you my code so you can see whats happening?
[02:13:15] <Cork> sure
[02:14:17] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/scq96dqvtozyypr06lpw
[02:14:27] <Cork> (also please use jsfiddle.net
[02:14:28] <Cork> )
[02:15:15] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: create an array for the new elements in line 8
[02:15:55] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: push the new elements into it as you process the urls
[02:16:10] <Cork> and when the last url has resolved ($.when helps here)
[02:16:19] <Cork> append all of it to the page in one swoop
[02:16:35] <Cork> actually that might be even simpler
[02:16:46] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: push the elements inside the .get?
[02:17:46] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: would you mind just showing a quick eg
[02:17:55] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: $.when.call(null, $.map(dataUrl, function(url) { return $.get(url); })).then(function(data) {});
[02:18:07] <Cork> data will contain all the responses when all of them has resolved
[02:18:10] <Cork> just loop that
[02:18:31] <mdunbavan1985> inside the .each?
[02:18:35] <Cork> no
[02:18:40] <Cork> instead of all of it
[02:18:52] <Cork> then is where all the url has been resolved to content
[02:19:12] <Cork> and you need to loop each response and then each part of each response
[02:19:36] <mdunbavan1985> so to append that to a div I would do the append inside the .then function?
[02:19:42] <b0t> Hello, how to create metadescription with jquery?
[02:19:49] <Cork> you generally don't want to append in a loop
[02:19:59] <Cork> each append causes a reflow in the page
[02:20:03] <Cork> and it makes thing VERY slow
[02:20:10] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: whats a better approach?
[02:20:13] <Cork> you want to create an array, and then append the entire array in one go
[02:20:53] <Cork> then you reduce the reflows from O^n to 1
[02:21:05] <mdunbavan1985> create an array with all of the data I need and then append it all?
[02:21:24] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: before the $.each(data loop you create the array
[02:21:31] <Cork> then you .push the data to this array
[02:21:40] <Cork> after the loop you do $('target').append(arr);
[02:21:59] <ThoMe_> hiho
[02:22:21] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: or $('target').append(arr.join('')) if the array contains strings
[02:23:41] <b0t> Hello, how to create metadescription with jquery?
[02:24:10] <Cork> b0t: why would you want to?
[02:24:13] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: so inside the $.each do the $.when then create the array before the $.each and push all new elements to the new array and then append at the end
[02:24:28] <Cork> meta data only has a point if it is in the initial html header
[02:24:37] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: no
[02:24:42] <Cork> the other way around
[02:24:50] <b0t> Http://jsfiddle.net/4q69df3c/1/
[02:24:53] <b0t> I need
[02:25:12] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: you do $.when.call with the $.map+$.get calls
[02:25:20] <Cork> and in the .then you $.each loop the responses
[02:25:51] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: note this part: $.map(dataUrl, function(url) { return $.get(url); })
[02:26:03] <latemus> Cork: that function now outputs [object Object] instead of the html
[02:26:05] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: that ^ does the work for me
[02:26:41] <Cork> ah
[02:26:48] <Cork> you have an additional each loop
[02:27:25] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: you would have to collect the urls and put them into a combined array
[02:27:38] <Cork> if you want them to append in order to the same element
[02:28:06] <Cork> ah, wait sorry i read the code a bit wrong
[02:28:17] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: this is getting way more complex than I expected
[02:28:30] <mdunbavan1985> :)
[02:28:40] <ThoMe_> have a selectbox and when i change a option, then i would like get all options (values)
[02:28:43] <ThoMe_> $('#user_liste').click(function () { ...
[02:28:50] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: $.map($("#data-urls li"), function(elm) { return $.get($(elm).data('url')); })
[02:28:53] <ThoMe_> and then? :-)
[02:28:58] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: just a slight change from the old loop
[02:29:33] <Cork> latemus: yes you get an dom element back (wrapped in jquery)
[02:29:53] <Cork> latemus: if you want to get a string back you don't use jquery
[02:29:59] <Cork> just concat the strings
[02:30:22] <Cork> ThoMe_: .change should give you want you want
[02:30:52] <latemus> Cork: okay. can i use     return $('<div>', { id: idVar }).html(<html string>).text();
[02:30:56] <latemus> or .val()
[02:31:07] <Cork> ThoMe_: $.map($(this).find(':selected'), function(elm) { return $(this).val() });
[02:31:17] <Cork> latemus: no
[02:31:23] <latemus> hmm
[02:31:28] <Cork> that would give you the text content and no html
[02:31:33] <Cork> .html would give you the inner html
[02:31:41] <Cork> but as you only want the html you already have
[02:31:43] <b0t> Var nn = $("div.post_body").first().text().split(" ").slice(0, -1).join(" ") + "...";
[02:31:44] <b0t> $('meta[name=description]').attr('description', nn);
[02:31:44] <Cork> just do that
[02:31:52] <latemus> Cork: Okay, Thank you
[02:33:04] <b0t> Corky help
[02:33:23] <Uhkis> lol
[02:33:40] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: with that last bit of code, does that apply to what we talked about earlier for appending the array of data?
[02:34:12] <ThoMe_> Cork: i Need map?
[02:34:13] <Cork> b0t: meta tags is read as the page is parsed, it is pointless to add them with js after the fact
[02:34:21] <Cork> anyway gtg
[02:34:37] <b0t> Thanks
[02:43:08] <FilipNortic> Inside a each function does return work as break or continue?
[02:43:20] <b0t> .j php
[02:45:22] <ThoMe_> a select box, option entry, readonly is:  $(this).attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[02:45:22] <ThoMe_> or?
[02:47:41] <samuel02> How can I empty Access-Control-Request-Headers for a specific ajax request. Because of a bunch of prefilters this header is set for a preflight request to an external api and for that particular request I want that header to only contain x-requested-with
[02:49:11] <FilipNortic> ThoMe_: I think  $(this).prop("readonly",true) is considered better
[02:49:25] <ThoMe_> oh ok. thax filipi :)
[02:51:05] <Cork> ya, attr doesn't work for toggling preferences in all browsers
[02:51:24] <Cork> *properties
[02:51:54] <Cork> samuel02: you mean from the browser, or from script in the page?
[02:52:02] <Cork> cause the later can't do it
[02:53:06] <samuel02> Cork: I don't understand the difference? It's in a js application running in the browser. For most requests I'm dealing with my "own" server application and use e.g. an authorization header
[02:53:17] <samuel02> so I have a bunch of prefilters set up
[02:53:30] <samuel02> but for this particular request which goes to an external api
[02:53:40] <Cork> samuel02: there is a difference between chrome/priviliged code
[02:53:41] <samuel02> I get Request header field X-CSRF-Token is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
[02:53:43] <Cork> and content code
[02:53:52] <samuel02> I see
[02:54:00] <Cork> content code is what runs in a page, and it has close to no access to the browsers settings and caches
[02:54:27] <Cork> doesn't matter if you run in from your own server or not
[02:54:31] <samuel02> ok, well I don't think I have to touch any browser settings and caches
[02:54:56] <samuel02> I just need to remove all custom headers for this particular request
[02:54:56] <Cork> well the Access-Control-Request-Headers is cached by the browser
[02:55:07] <Cork> the browser only make the OPTION request once
[02:55:11] <Cork> and then caches the response
[02:55:15] <samuel02> so that it doesn't add them all to "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" in the preflight request
[02:55:21] <arup_r> Any body reading this book ? http://www.manning.com/derosa/
[02:55:50] <samuel02> Cork: really? so it caches that header once and uses the same for all requests no matter the destination?
[02:55:58] <Cork> yes
[02:56:10] <Cork> the OPTION call is "what are you allowed to send"
[02:56:17] <Cork> that is all it is meant to say
[02:56:19] <samuel02> I see..
[02:56:41] <Cork> if you would have to make a preflight call for every request you would make things slow
[02:56:45] <samuel02> So would I solve that? Since I guess that's what causes the external api, in this case vimeo to refuse the request
[02:57:01] <samuel02> Cork: well I can see it does a preflight request for this one
[02:57:12] <Cork> samuel02: it should only be once though
[02:57:15] <Cork> the first call
[02:57:34] <Cork> (per site its called from)
[02:57:50] <Erwat> yay! i just made my first chrome extension
[02:57:55] <Erwat> it was alot easier than i had thought
[02:58:09] <Erwat> but the initial examples i came up with on google weren't what i was looking for at all
[02:58:12] <samuel02> Cork: that doesn't seem to be the case here.. I see a lot of "OPTIONS" request in the network tab
[02:58:29] <Cork> samuel02: do you get any answers from the server though?
[02:58:42] <Cork> options is fired for every request if no answer is given
[02:58:49] <samuel02> yeah, from my "own" servers I have no issues
[02:58:58] <Cork> uh
[02:59:03] <samuel02> because there I can control the cors setup
[02:59:06] <samuel02> server-side
[02:59:16] <Cork> what do you're own server have to do with this?
[02:59:18] <samuel02> but now when I want to fetch some data from vimeo I get this issue
[02:59:36] <Cork> samuel02: option is requested from the remote server
[02:59:44] <Cork> if the remote server doesn't support cross domain ajax
[02:59:48] <Cork> you can't get around it
[02:59:51] <tuskkk___> I am using the following code to hide an error message, it works fine on all browsers, but on IE the cursor starts blinking rapidly for a second or two. On inspecting it in firebug, I see the some strange numbers reducing to zero and making display:none. How do I resolve it?
[02:59:53] <tuskkk___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uzV0Dm2A
[03:00:26] <Cork> samuel02: the option call is there to allow the remote server to OPT IN to cross domain ajax
[03:00:41] <Cork> it has to be explicitly answered for the feature to be allowed
[03:13:16] <mdunbavan1985> Hi does anyone know why I keep getting undefined on this function when getting data in a loop?
[03:14:00] <mdunbavan1985> $("#data-urls li"), function(elm) { $.get( $(elm).data('url'), function(data){ var body = data.body_html }, 'json');     });
[03:16:45] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: you've missed the point of what i tried to tell you
[03:17:10] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: use delegated and $.when to collect all the data in one swoop
[03:17:12] <Ayub_> has any one tried http://www.slideshare.net/jottley/cors-enable-alfresco-for-cors
[03:17:19] <Cork> sorry deferred not delegate
[03:17:33] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: that is what the $.when.call line i gave you before did
[03:18:17] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: sorry its being a pain is this
[03:18:54] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: you should read up on how .when works
[03:19:05] <Cork> it will help understand how it is meant to work
[03:20:48] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: sorry yes looking now. I think I will just rewrite the whole thing with this, which is basically what you did
[03:21:17] <Cork> yes
[03:21:20] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: http://jsfiddle.net/k186oj3z/
[03:22:04] <mdunbavan1985> ah okay, bit different to what I thought
[03:24:20] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: I need to return json data
[03:24:48] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: what you get doesn't change
[03:25:04] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: only difference is that you have an array of "data" instead of one callback for each
[03:25:21] <tuskkk___> can the hide() time of 400 cause this?
[03:25:24] <Cork> everything below that is the same
[03:26:04] <Cork> tuskkk___: .hide with a string or number causes animation yes
[03:26:23] <tuskkk___> Cork: no, excessive blinking
[03:26:30] <Cork> and animation is done by modifying height and then display
[03:26:37] <tuskkk___> in IE only
[03:26:49] <tuskkk___> yes, saw that
[03:27:03] <tuskkk___> but can it cause the cursor to go bonkers in IE?
[03:27:11] <Cork> is the element with the "cursor" inside the animated element?
[03:27:16] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: okay so If I want to access the json data for that how could I convert it as I need to be able to get that exact data
[03:27:32] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: it should behave exactly like before
[03:27:43] <Cork> requests[0] === data from first request
[03:27:52] <tuskkk___> Cork: no, outsite
[03:27:57] <tuskkk___> outside*
[03:28:03] <Cork> then not likely
[03:28:17] <Cork> but sure, it is possible
[03:28:22] <tuskkk___> just below the input box
[03:28:26] <Cork> what version of ie are we talking about?
[03:28:30] <tuskkk___> 11
[03:28:39] <Cork> tuskkk___: then even less likely * 2
[03:28:50] <tuskkk___> then how to trace what's causing it?
[03:29:23] <Cork> remove call one at a time until the problem goes away
[03:29:32] <Cork> then slowly add them back to find where it comes from
[03:29:34] <tuskkk___> oh
[03:29:52] <Cork> then create a minified testcase if you don't understand why it happens
[03:29:55] <tuskkk___> the problem is, I develop on Centos, its gonna be a mess
[03:30:08] <Cork> vm ftw
[03:30:18] <tuskkk___> hmm
[03:30:25] <tuskkk___> thanks, will check it out
[03:31:00] <Cork> tuskkk___: https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools
[03:31:23] <tuskkk___> Cork: been there already, thats a 5GB machine
[03:31:28] <Cork> ya
[03:31:32] <tuskkk___> am better off testing on local
[03:31:33] <Cork> not much you can do about that
[03:32:07] <Cork> tuskkk___: ie isn't really a browser, its just a ui infront of system libs
[03:32:11] <mdev> I wish jquery controls didn't suck so bad with big data
[03:32:16] <Cork> so you can't really "just" have the browser
[03:32:20] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: when I do console.log(data); I get 0,1,2,3 outputted..?
[03:32:20] <Cork> so you need full systems
[03:32:27] <mdev> 40k combobox entries and plugins and plugin is so insanely slow
[03:32:35] <tuskkk___> IE sucks
[03:32:36] <mdev> 42k whatever, shouldn't matter
[03:32:43] <tuskkk___> I dont know why people still use it
[03:33:15] <mdev> newer ie apparently nice
[03:33:22] <mdev> the IE dev team did AMA on reddit
[03:33:22] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: when you do $.each(requests you mean?
[03:33:33] <mdunbavan1985> yes
[03:33:42] <mdev> they been working hard to break IE's bad rep and newer versions are lot more standard compliant
[03:33:47] <Cork> ah ya
[03:34:06] <Cork> mdunbavan1985: $.each(arr, function(index, value)
[03:34:11] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[03:34:47] <Cork> (i never remember if $.each is the one that have value, index or $.map...)
[03:35:53] <mdunbavan1985> with $.each I can get the index with function(data,i) and then use 'i' as the iterator
[03:36:14] <Cork> like i said it is function(i,data)
[03:37:02] <mdunbavan1985> ^ thats causing the problems? I when I console.log responses I get correct output but I need the json data from that
[03:42:57] <negaduck> hi! i have some buttons with .trigger class. How can I distinguish them when I bind a click handler to them?
[03:44:02] <Cork> negaduck: you mean you add and remove this class?
[03:44:17] <Cork> or you just want to separate a group of buttons with this class?
[03:44:59] <negaduck> already found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4938876/jquery-find-id-of-clicked-button-by-class
[03:45:28] <Cork> doesn't really answer what you're trying to do though
[03:49:14] <granden> Hi, anyone know of a cool plugin that would automaticly decide if a text should be light or dark? Depending on the image that is in the backgorund?
[03:51:22] <Cork> granden: that would be costly how ever you do it
[03:51:47] <Cork> the plugin would have to load the image in a canvas and try to calculate the median of the image through that
[03:53:42] <mkc> I have   div#menu-1 > div.submenu-about    . how do I add .hover event to div.submenu-about  ?
[03:54:06] <mdev> javascript should be a lot faster, is ridiculous they can't make it faster than native code
[03:54:10] <Cork> uh, by selecting the elements and binding it?
[03:54:17] <mdev> billion dollar companies, smartest devs on the planet
[03:54:25] <Cork> O_o
[03:54:40] <Cork> mdev: funny, ha ha...
[03:55:17] <mkc> Cork: Could you write me such selector?
[03:55:23] <Cork> you just did
[03:55:34] <Cork> just remove the extra divs
[03:55:38] <mkc> well it does not work :/
[03:55:48] <Cork> ?paste
[03:55:48] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:57:19] <mkc> COrk:  just notice there are some other js errors.. this could be why it does not work
[03:57:44] <Cork> mkc: a side note don't EVER prefix an id with an element name
[03:58:00] <Cork> your slowing down the selector for no good reason
[04:00:21] <mkc> Cork: Thanks
[04:01:07] <Cork> same goes for classes, but there are situations where it is needed there
[04:02:14] <blackkbot> ive never really seen how much these things slow down the browser do you have any jsperfs of these things?
[04:02:26] <blackkbot> not saying i don't believe you
[04:02:38] <blackkbot> what you are saying sounds reasonable
[04:02:48] <Cork> blackkbot: in simple short selectors the speed difference is tiny
[04:03:08] <Cork> but if you have a long dom or a complex selector it can make a big difference
[04:03:15] <blackkbot> how about getElementsById vs a selector>
[04:03:33] <blackkbot> err element*
[04:03:40] <Cork> for #id ve getElementById the speed is the same in modern browsers
[04:03:53] <samuel02> Cork: I still don't understand your point? I have a server application (Ruby on Rails) and a JS client app which communicates with the server application without problems via a rest api. it uses headers such as Authorization and X-Csrf-Token for secure communication. So I have some prefilters which add these headers to all ajax requests. Now I want to make a
[04:03:53] <samuel02> request to the Vimeo oEmbed API instead which afaik supports CORS.
[04:04:02] <Cork> but yes spliting up the selector can make big differences
[04:04:34] <samuel02> the problem is in the preflight request the Access-Control-Request-Headers header is set to "accept, x-csrf-token, x-requested-with, authorization"
[04:04:34] <Cork> blackkbot: the main point is not specifying extra selectors before an unique selector is very easy to do
[04:05:04] <samuel02> Cork: but in the response from Vimeo: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With so it fails
[04:05:23] <samuel02> thus I would like to send only "X-Requested-With" for this particular request only
[04:05:23] <blackkbot> absolutely i agree good advice
[04:05:27] <samuel02> is that possible?
[04:05:46] <Cork> samuel02: you can't control what vimeo will accept
[04:05:52] <Cork> they set those values
[04:06:08] <samuel02> yeah, but I can control what I send?
[04:06:17] <blackkbot> only slightly
[04:06:42] <Cork> samuel02: you can to some degree, but the browser will restrict you
[04:06:55] <samuel02> Cork: Like I said, right now I'm sending Access-Control-Request-Headers:accept, x-csrf-token, x-requested-with, authorization but instead I want to send Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
[04:07:50] <samuel02> at least that's what I assume is the issue here?
[04:08:44] <Cork> samuel02: the browser sets what headers is in that header
[04:08:47] <Cork> as far as i know
[04:08:58] <Cork> you can't control it
[04:09:15] <samuel02> yeah but that depends on what headers are set on the xhr object
[04:09:18] <Cork> samuel02: OPTIONS is a trust query between the browser and the target site
[04:09:24] <samuel02> sure
[04:09:30] <Cork> the site making the request isn't really part of the trust chain
[04:09:56] <samuel02> so if I've set an Authorization header on the xhr object it will add it to Access-Control-Request-Headers when making the preflight request
[04:10:16] <samuel02> so what I need to do is to reset that header for this specific request
[04:10:30] <samuel02> but it seems like I can't just do xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', null);
[04:10:34] <Cork> well not for custom headers
[04:10:36] <Cork> ya
[04:10:36] <granden> Cork: Ok, so its not advised to do it then? Perhaps doing something similair but on server side?
[04:11:08] <Cork> granden: you might be able to do something with mix-blend-mode
[04:11:16] <Cork> but it is VERY new and not many browsers support it
[04:11:25] <granden> I just found this
[04:11:26] <granden> http://pastebin.com/kWGe8Pp7
[04:11:30] <blackkbot> xhr will actually block you if you attempt to change the origin or other cors things
[04:11:31] <granden> IS that a very heavy function?
[04:11:52] <Cork> granden: no, bu it only works with background COLORS not images
[04:11:59] <granden> Ah I see
[04:12:45] <Cork> granden: and that is where things gets ugly
[04:13:04] <Cork> granden: to do it against an image you would have to render the image and loop all pixels in the image
[04:13:07] <Cork> and then grab each color
[04:13:08] <granden> I see, ok. Will have to look up some PHP solution then.
[04:13:48] <Cork> but ya, keeping a "color" for the image is prob a better option
[04:13:52] <samuel02> ok so let's pose the question like this instead; is there any way I can override a request header set with setRequestHeader somewhere?
[04:14:02] <samuel02> i.e. remove custom headers
[04:14:11] <samuel02> which are set elsewhere in the js application
[04:14:25] <Cork> no, you would have to not call setRequestHeader
[04:16:25] <samuel02> ok, never mind, I found a way of solving it
[04:16:54] <samuel02> in that specific request I add xhr.setRequestHeader('authorization', undefined) in the beforeSend method
[04:17:13] <samuel02> that removes the custom header which causes the browser to generate the correct preflight request
[04:17:20] <samuel02> which makes it all work
[04:17:37] <samuel02> I tried to set it to null before and didn't think about the undefined value
[04:17:44] <samuel02> Cork: thanks anyways
[04:18:28] <Cork> samuel02: don't forget to test in all browsers
[04:18:36] <Cork> cause i'm not sure that is actually intended
[04:19:08] <samuel02> Cork: why not? I want to reset a header for a request I'm controlling
[04:19:28] <Cork> samuel02: you set the header in one place and want to undo it later
[04:19:42] <Cork> i'm far from sure that is actually specified in spec
[04:26:00] <samuel02> Cork: Ok.. I will test. That seems weird though that there wouldn't be any way of overriding a custom header
[04:28:01] <mdunbavan1985> Cork: hey hope your still here, managed to get some data which is great but ots only finding the first url from the list not all of them...
[04:28:32] <Ayub_> I have an issue with doing file upload with ajaxform..coudl some one assist me ?
[04:28:38] <Ayub_> UhKis: I am using https://github.com/malsup/form for ajax form file upload
[04:29:01] <Ayub_> UhKis: when I use older version of the ajaxForm plugin success callback is always invoked
[04:35:59] <Ayub_> Cork: have you tried https://github.com/malsup/form ? for cross domain file upload ?
[04:36:54] <Cork> sigh
[04:37:02] <Cork> man i hate web client chatters...
[04:37:15] <Cork> they always leave before you give them the answers to the question -_-'
[04:37:52] <Cork> Ayub_: no, now days i just require formData support
[04:38:13] <Cork> or fallback to plain form posts
[04:44:45] <Uhkis> Cork: /ignore *!*webchat@* :-D
[04:44:59] <Cork> ya, that really is an option
[04:45:12] <Cork> mdunbavan1985 has done it twice on me today...
[04:47:47] <stangeland> i have a td and in that td i have input fields. I have click event on both input field and td, but i want it such that if i click on the input field only the eventhandler for that input field should be fired and not its containing td field. is that possible?
[04:48:07] <stangeland> somhow to stop the event from bubbling up the hierarchy
[04:48:19] <Cork> stangeland: check if event.target == input in the td event handler
[04:48:33] <stangeland> ahh
[04:48:36] <Cork> stangeland: you can stop even from bubbling, but it is a bad idea
[04:48:44] <stangeland> ok, why bad idea?
[04:48:52] <Ayub_> Cork:formData support is not available on IE9 right ?
[04:49:02] <Cork> cause you might later depend on the event, but you sometimes kill it
[04:49:14] <Cork> so you create bugs that is very hard to find
[04:49:22] <Cork> <-- has does this exact problem my self
[04:49:30] <Cork> solution: rewrite the page from scratch :/
[04:49:38] <Cork> Ayub_: right
[04:49:48] <blackkbot> thats not a solution! just refactor
[04:49:54] <blackkbot> same difference tho
[04:50:08] <Ayub_> how do you manage file upload on IE 9 without formData support then ?
[04:50:21] <Ayub_> Cork:avoid ie 9 ?
[04:50:26] <Cork> blackkbot: at the point where i got the problem in question the entire page depended way to much on it
[04:50:59] <Cork> Ayub_: "<Cork> or fallback to plain form posts"
[04:51:04] <blackkbot> yeah everyone does it at some point or another
[04:51:30] <Cork> i learned my lessen then :)
[04:51:33] <Ayub_> Cork: could you give me an example of plain form post for file upload ?
[04:51:44] <Cork> so i almost never touch stopPropagation or return false; now days
[04:51:47] <Cork> for just this reason
[04:52:05] <Cork> Ayub_: <form action=""> <input type="file">
[04:52:26] <Cork> meaning i don't use ajax for browsers that don't do formData
[04:52:33] <Cork> they get the old full page reload
[04:53:11] <Ayub_> Cork: I want to use file upload in model form and dont want to navigate to any other page..I need to call rest api and show response on the same model form
[04:53:17] <Cork> it is a small enough market, and the function still "works"
[04:53:56] <Ayub_> Cork: if I use plain <form action=""> how can I show the response I get back from rest api ?
[04:54:18] <Cork> Ayub_: uh, you've used a none js submit form before right??
[04:54:39] <Ayub_> Cork: yes
[04:54:44] <Cork> Ayub_: then you know how it works
[04:54:49] <Cork> there is no magic there
[04:55:08] <Cork> you literally get what you send
[04:55:34] <Cork> Ayub_: i just separate ajax post and non ajax post on the backend
[04:55:36] <Ayub_> Cork: may be I fogot..for non js page navigates..I dont want to navigate the page..
[04:55:43] <Cork> and do a full page load if it isn't ajax
[04:55:51] <Cork> and just push the html that way
[04:56:10] <Cork> Ayub_: i'm not really saying you should do it this way
[04:56:18] <Ayub_> Cork: ok..
[04:56:23] <Cork> only what i do, and why i haven't tested what you asked
[04:56:32] <Erwat> when i press the "h" key
[04:56:44] <Erwat> why does the onkeydown event handler in chrome say the keyCode is 72
[04:56:45] <Cork> i don't put development time into supporting "moderny" features on legacy browsers
[04:56:51] <Ayub_> ok
[04:57:01] <Erwat> when "h".charCodeAt(0) gives me 104 and "H".charCodeAt(0) gives 72?
[04:57:11] <Cork> i only care for that they should get a functional experience
[04:57:23] <Cork> for as little work as possible
[04:57:41] <Erwat> Cork: do you have set up an IE6 tax?
[04:57:54] <Erwat> where you increases prices when viewed through IE6?
[04:57:59] <Cork> Erwat: ie<8 == not supported at all
[04:58:10] <Erwat> that's silly
[04:58:16] <Erwat> just double the price of everything
[04:58:25] <Erwat> every version lower than 8 multiplies price by two
[04:58:32] <Cork> Erwat: i don't want to manage the css hell needed to support ie6
[04:58:45] <Cork> i've done it enough i never want to get back there again
[04:59:35] <Cork> a css engine that can't even handle direct child selectors...
[04:59:41] <Cork> no thanks
[04:59:53] <Uhkis> id everything!
[05:00:36] <Cork> Erwat: when i did support ie6 its was about 5 days development time for none ie
[05:01:01] <Cork> and about 2 days to get it rendering in ie7 and ~7 days for ie6...
[05:01:10] <Cork> its just insane
[05:01:36] <Cork> and ie6's unique css file was about 5 times bigger then the normal one, cause you have to duplicate so freaking much
[05:02:05] <Erwat> "Hello, customer, we detected that you have been viewing it with an obsolete browser. Click here to pay the obsolete browser tax to view the webpage."
[05:02:06] <Cork> (specially for tree like css dropdown menus)
[05:02:43] <Cork> Erwat: i'd rather just send them html - css
[05:03:27] <Erwat> alternatively replace "customer" with your favorite derogatory term like "peasant"
[05:03:47] <stangeland> Cork, thank you
[05:04:24] <Cork> stangeland: np
[05:31:43] <blackkbot> she's a witch!
[05:31:50] <baako> hi guys. I have a html div which pop up when some contents when a button is clicked. In this div i also have a button and the job of this button is to alert a text when it is clicked. Unfortunately it doesn't do this. So I when I try it out on jsfiddle and the text get alerted. My question is. Is the browser not reading the "id" of this button because it is a pop up?
[05:32:47] <Cork> baako: is the content static or loaded through ajax?
[05:33:26] <blackkbot> when do you attempt to assign the function to the button
[05:33:29] <titii> I have a loop $('table').each .... how to make a condition to determine if th contain colspan or rowspan? to put here some aditional class.
[05:33:38] <blackkbot> before it exists more than likely
[05:34:09] <Cork> titii: welcome to table hell
[05:34:24] <Cork> titii: you would have to loop related table rows/columns and check for the attribute
[05:35:00] <titii> Cork: ty man, but which function or how to check for the attribute to get boolean?
[05:35:48] <blackkbot> $('table th[attr]')?
[05:35:51] <Cork> titii: $(this).closets('tr').prev().find('target-column-selector[rowspan]')
[05:35:53] <Cork> or example
[05:36:05] <Cork> *closest
[05:36:18] <baako> Cork: the content in the popup div is load via ajax
[05:36:30] <Cork> baako: then bind a delegated event handler on the div
[05:36:42] <Cork> and have it handle the click on the button
[05:36:43] <titii> Cork but i am looping the tables
[05:37:04] <Cork> titii: ya, so you have to figure out where the rowspan/colspan "would be"
[05:37:11] <Cork> and if it exist adjust based on it
[05:37:27] <Cork> titii: this is what i meant by table hell
[05:37:52] <Cork> there isn't anything to identify if something is shifted by colspan/rowspan except finding the td with the attribute
[05:38:00] <titii> Cork: but how to determine if the th contain that attribute to get boolean?
[05:38:08] <titii> basicly i am looping all tables
[05:38:14] <baako> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/3b33xf3f/ this is the jquery. which handle the on click of the button in the popup div.
[05:38:34] <Cork> titii: $(this).is('[colspan], [rowspan]')
[05:39:01] <Cork> where "this" is the th
[05:39:37] <Cork> baako: that is only html though
[05:40:15] <titii> Cork: hmmm so it looks to make another loop on any th in the table?
[05:40:24] <baako> Cork: am so sorry i accidently deleted the js but it is $('#update-music').click(function() {         alert('hello');      });
[05:40:36] <Cork> titii: you have to be MUCH more specific
[05:40:40] <latemus> What am i doing wrong on line 11 that is causing line 22 to fail? http://pastebin.com/bKVGqsWp I have ensured the api is returning a json string
[05:40:41] <Cork> you can't generically check for this
[05:41:09] <Cork> titii: you have to make a complex related search for each row (if you want to support full colspan/rowspan)
[05:41:29] <Cork> so what limitations you can put in the support makes all the difference
[05:41:34] <Cork> and what you need to do, and so on
[05:42:10] <Cork> latemus: wow lots
[05:42:20] <Cork> 1. your creating a local variable but try to access it globally
[05:42:35] <latemus> lol
[05:42:38] <Cork> 2. you try to use an async value outside its async scope
[05:42:55] <Cork> 3. you're mixing success and done (supported, but...)
[05:43:28] <Cork> latemus: just move the "data" attribute to done(function(data)
[05:43:36] <Cork> and use data[0] instead of userIdVal
[05:43:40] <latemus> im only using success.. nm you just answered it :)
[05:43:53] <latemus> oh, dont even bother to  rename it?
[05:43:56] <latemus> cool
[05:44:04] <Cork> and completely remove the success: callback
[05:44:48] <latemus> Thanks Cork . You bet, I will. I'd rather use .done but i wasnt sure if i could use the data object there, thanks for the education
[05:44:49] <latemus> :D
[05:45:04] <Cork> latemus: .done is exactly the same as success
[05:45:11] <latemus> haha perfect
[05:45:11] <Cork> except exposed through deferred
[05:45:18] <latemus> i see
[05:45:34] <Cork> same with error => fail
[05:45:39] <Cork> and completed => always
[05:45:52] <Ayub_> could some one check this fiddle ? http://fiddle.jshell.net/876fzzd5/5/
[05:45:58] <latemus> ohh, ok. this is ringing a bell from the api docs
[05:46:19] <Ayub_> always success function is called..I am making a cross domain ajaxForm submit
[05:46:34] <baako> Cork: i have try http://pastebin.com/9kTuT5yx but i dont get the alert message
[05:46:50] <Cork> heh
[05:46:57] <Cork> baako: read the docks
[05:47:17] <Cork> firstly you most likely want to use .on instead of .delegate
[05:47:21] <Cork> but you're syntax is wrong
[05:47:31] <Cork> *docs
[05:47:39] <Cork> ?g api.jquery delegate
[05:47:40] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:47:54] <Cork> baako: the $() selector should be a static parent
[05:48:09] <Cork> not the same as the selector you pass to the  handler
[05:48:37] <stangeland> What is the right way to set percentage width on a table if i want first column to be 15,next 50 and last 35? Do i have to set width on each td?
[05:49:23] <baako> Cork: i have try the button as the selector
[05:49:37] <Cork> stangeland: i usually just set the width + min/max-width on thead td/th
[05:50:04] <baako> Cork: got it now
[05:50:20] <titii> Cork: TY, the .is() solve my problem +best
[05:50:56] <baako> Cork: thanks and God bless
[05:51:05] <stangeland> Cork, ahh ok....and then the rest will adjust automatically?
[05:51:08] <Cork> yes
[05:51:20] <Cork> as long as you don't set conflicting values on another element
[05:51:28] <Cork> cause then... ya, not fun... :D
[06:01:37] <Ayub_> I am using iFrame resizer http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/
[06:02:12] <Ayub_> works good when the actual content height increases..however the height does not change when model dialog is opened..
[06:02:48] <baako> Cork: like i use delegate to attach a handler to the button event. do I need to do the same if i wanted to get a text. for example var songname = $('#songname').text(); doesn't work
[06:02:59] <baako> in terms of it doesn't get the text
[06:03:34] <Cork> baako: when you run $() you make a query in the page
[06:03:47] <Cork> baako: when that link runs the target of the selector must exist or you won't find anything
[06:04:05] <Cork> baako: also note that ids is page global unique
[06:04:12] <Cork> you can't have two elements with the same id
[06:06:38] <baako> Cork: i only have 1 id with that name
[06:07:00] <Cork> baako: then it is that the element doesn't exist when you query for it
[06:07:33] <baako> Cork: it is in that popup div andf it exist
[06:07:42] <baako> when i select in the broswer i can see it
[06:07:58] <Cork> but the see it happens after the ajax call right?
[06:08:02] <Cork> while the code runs before
[06:08:35] <Cork> (it's the most likely reason at least)
[06:09:02] <baako> Cork: http://pastebin.com/dVtKcJq5
[06:09:18] <Cork> O_o
[06:09:29] <Cork> your binding the click handler to EVERY DIV IN THE PAGE ??
[06:10:06] <Cork> anyway if that is true it just means songname is empty
[06:12:04] <baako> Cork: oh the delegate only works when i use div as the selector
[06:12:09] <baako> i didnt wotk when i try button
[06:13:57] <Cork> baako: read the documentation
[06:14:22] <baako> Cork: i have
[06:14:28] <Cork> baako: the syntax is $('static parent selector').delegate('target selector inside the static parent', 'event'
[06:14:44] <Cork> baako: then you need to read it one more time
[06:17:27] <sniperh4x0r> hey are there any jquery devs here form the boston area?
[06:17:34] <baako> Cork: thanks
[06:17:48] <sniperh4x0r> I'm trying to figure out what salary I should ask for going full time as a primarily jquery dev
[06:17:50] <sniperh4x0r> i do some php too
[06:17:54] <sniperh4x0r> and scss etc.
[06:18:08] <sniperh4x0r> i'm from the boston area
[06:18:27] <sniperh4x0r> i already told them 70k to start but I'm thinking maybe I should start higher and negotiate from there?
[06:19:56] <sniperh4x0r> Originally I was getting paid as a consultant and getting about 50k a year when I was going thru the consulting agency
[06:20:08] <sniperh4x0r> but I dont think my employers are even looking at that salary
[06:20:24] <baako> Cork: $( "body" ).delegate("#update-music", "click", function() { doesn't work either
[06:20:35] <sniperh4x0r> so I'm thinking I can start out off the bate and go with something high like 80k and see what they think about that?
[06:20:49] <Cork> baako: uh, that makes no sense
[06:21:00] <Cork> baako: are you sure the code runs at all?
[06:22:22] <baako> Cork: no error on the broswer. I have run it on firefox and chrome
[06:22:43] <baako> so i guess it runs because if i put alert("hello");
[06:22:46] <baako> i get the alert
[06:23:11] <Cork> can't help you more without seeing the problem
[06:23:12] <baako> but when i try to alert a variable i get blank alert
[06:23:43] <baako> and they is something in the input field
[06:24:28] <baako> Cork: i see
[06:24:36] <baako> .text wouldnt work but .val will
[06:24:49] <Cork> ah the target is input fields
[06:30:14] <pdcmoreira> Guys, i'm using select2 plugin which is initiated with $('#some_element').select2({ options }); I can pass it the option in this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21992727/display-result-matching-optgroup-using-select2 -- The thing is, i would like this to be the standard behavior, without having to copy/paste that option every time. Is that possible?
[06:48:41] <athan> Hi everyone, is there a way to perform a query on children of an element?
[06:48:58] <athan> something like $(".foo").within(someElem);
[06:49:28] <Cork> ?g api.jquery find
[06:49:30] <b-ot> Cork: .find() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/find/
[06:49:49] <athan> Cork: Thank you :)
[06:49:52] <Cork> np
[06:50:05] <Cork> athan: it is the reverse of how your wrote it though
[06:50:16] <Cork>  $(someElem).find(".foo");
[06:51:03] <athan> Cork: That makes sense. Is there any way to get the union of two queries?
[06:51:13] <athan> (sorry for bugging you :[)
[06:51:29] <Cork> $('').filter('')
[06:51:36] <Cork> or .not()
[06:51:41] <Cork> depending if you want to include or exclude
[06:52:13] <athan> Cork: Ahh perfect, thanks :)
[06:52:39] <Cork> $('.foo').not($(someElement).find('.foo')) :)
[06:53:19] <athan> Cork: That would take the difference? :s
[06:53:59] <athan> I'm trying to combine a few, all `<input>` and `<textarea>` tags
[06:54:26] <pdcmoreira> i usually do $('#dis_children', dat_parent)
[06:58:46] <Erwat> i just ran into an issue for the first time in my life
[06:59:03] <Cork> athan: that would result in all .foo elements that isn't a child of someElement
[06:59:04] <athan> pdcmoreira: Thank you :)
[06:59:05] <Erwat> where i could not use self.blah to call blah because it contained a hyphen
[07:01:05] <Cork> Erwat: heh first time?
[07:01:10] <Cork> you've been lucky then :)
[07:01:16] <Erwat> well not first time
[07:01:21] <Erwat> so far it has always been in a loop
[07:01:28] <Erwat> or similar, but i had never thought of a hyphen being an issue like that
[07:03:17] <Cork> well space is what i've seen the most
[07:04:36] <cjohnson> pdcmoreira: put your config in a globally accessible variable and use that global to pass to select2. or make a global function to do the same
[07:04:58] <cjohnson> var foo = function(selector) { return $(selector).select2({ your options }); };
[07:05:06] <cjohnson> foo('#some_element')
[07:06:09] <pdcmoreira> maybe include a "select2-init.js" with that, before the plugin?
[07:06:31] <pdcmoreira> and call the init function
[07:06:35] <pdcmoreira> hmm
[07:06:58] <pdcmoreira> ty
[07:23:17] <athan> hmm, so when using `.find`, the selectors are just appended -
[07:23:33] <cjohnson> appended?
[07:23:50] <athan> $("#foo").find(".bar, .baz") == $("#foo .bar, .baz")
[07:23:52] <cjohnson> the selector is called on the node you called .find on, and .find returns a new collection of the matching child elements
[07:23:53] <BillCriswell> athan: Essentially... if I'm understanding right.
[07:24:02] <athan> instead of $("#foo .bar, #foo .baz")
[07:24:26] <cjohnson> $('#foo').find('.bar, .baz') == $('#foo .bar, #foo .baz')
[07:24:27] <BillCriswell> $("#foo").find(".bar, .baz") == $("#foo .bar, #foo .baz")
[07:24:30] <cjohnson> no me BillCriswell
[07:24:34] <athan> o.o
[07:24:37] <cjohnson> heh
[07:24:49] <cjohnson> comma starts a whole new selector
[07:24:49] <BillCriswell> I won by .00002 seconds.
[07:29:47] <athan> What happened to `preventDefault`?
[07:30:17] <athan> wait nevermind, sorry
[07:30:24] <athan> I heard something about it getting deprecated
[07:31:56] <BillCriswell> athan: That would be a fun day.
[07:43:23] <notchris> Anyone decent with regex?
[07:45:35] <callumacrae> notchris: http://tryregex.com/ :D
[07:46:25] <cjohnson> don't ask to ask notchris
[07:46:26] <cjohnson> just ask
[07:47:56] <athan> notchris: It depends, are you using nondeterministic finite automata, or not?
[08:09:50] <BillCriswell> notchris: Shouldn't have to be hopefully.
[08:18:47] <Scriptonaut> could someone tell me what: $(function() { blah }); achieves?
[08:19:03] <Scriptonaut> is that the same as: (function() {})();
[08:21:29] <BillCriswell> Scriptonaut: No.
[08:21:43] <BillCriswell> The first one is basically a shorter form of document ready.
[08:22:04] <BillCriswell> The second is just an IIEF
[08:22:28] <Scriptonaut> oh, thanks :)
[08:22:39] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:13:01] <Conner05> my script loads fine on page load but after an ajax GET request one of my custom scripts stops working. I tried wrapping it in jQuery(function($) { //script }); and also jQuery(function($) { pageLoad() { //script } }); and neither works.
[09:14:29] <BillCriswell> Conner05: Are you looking for a click on an element or something event related?
[09:15:15] <Conner05> BillCriswell yes it's an on click event
[09:15:41] <BillCriswell> Conner05: You can use event delegation through .on().
[09:16:31] <BillCriswell> Conner05: You'd basically put the listener on an element that's always there and see what element it originates from.
[09:17:22] <Conner05> BillCriswell http://laravel.io/bin/Xy3bq that is my script. I get the "log" returned on page load but after this is ran: http://laravel.io/bin/Nkd9e I never get the "here" log on the event click
[09:18:53] <Conner05> that ajax call appends the <li> items on the <ul> that has the click event on it.
[09:22:31] <BillCriswell> Conner05: My recommendation still stands (I think)
[09:24:50] <robertmaxrees> Conner05 $('.dropdown-menu li').on( 'click', function( event ) { is bound to the lis
[09:25:10] <robertmaxrees> change that to $('.dropdown-menu').on('click', 'li', function(event) {
[09:25:14] <Conner05> BillCriswell I don't see how what I've done is different. Do you mean instead of the on click being on an element that's being modified put it on something that isn't being modified and see if it still works?
[09:25:50] <robertmaxrees> Conner05 he's suggesting you use event delegation.  se how my example adds an extra argument between the 'click' and callback?
[09:30:11] <Conner05> robertmaxrees yea I am trying to check it out but somehow I've screwed up my ajax request now even though I haven't even changed that function
[09:30:32] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:34:33] <Conner05> robertmaxrees that worked. Can you explain why?
[09:35:34] <VictorCL> hi I have this selector $("div[class^=clickzone_question_]") which would match 4 tags , how can I play just with the first one?
[09:35:47] <VictorCL> I mean how can I access the first element of the 4th?
[09:35:52] <BillCriswell> VictorCL: .first() or .eq(0)
[09:37:00] <BillCriswell> Conner05: Event listeners are only added once.
[09:38:17] <Conner05> BillCriswell so since there were no li items to begin with it didn't know what to do?
[09:38:43] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:39:00] <BillCriswell> I haven't been following very well though.
[09:39:36] <BillCriswell> But basically if you have <ul><li>Hi</li></ul> and you remove that <li> and add another <li> exactly the same in it's place it's a totally different element.
[09:39:46] <VictorCL> great thanks
[10:03:30] <stangeland> hi, isnt there a toggle class for 2 classes in jquery? so its toggling 2 different classes
[10:03:49] <robertmaxrees> you mean between two classes?  nope.
[10:04:03] <robertmaxrees> you can sort of cook that behavior in yourself, but it doesn't exist.
[10:04:46] <stangeland> ahhh toggleClass('glyphicon-chevron-up glyphicon-chevron-down')
[10:04:50] <stangeland> it was easy :)
[10:04:56] <robertmaxrees> Yeah, but that doesn't swap between the two necessarily.
[10:05:01] <stangeland> it does
[10:05:17] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/
[10:05:22] <robertmaxrees> reread the description ;)
[10:06:17] <stangeland> yeah i dont see the problem....first add the one then the other then the one etc
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:06:29] <stangeland> Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument.
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> toggle each class separately.
[10:07:46] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Maybe overthinking that?
[10:07:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1gpunx2d/
[10:08:06] <robertmaxrees> you can use it to do implicit swapping of classes.
[10:08:11] <robertmaxrees> but that's not really what it does.
[10:08:37] <robertmaxrees> for each class, add it if it doesn't exist, or remove it if it does.
[10:09:18] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ok I see what you're saying.
[10:09:38] <robertmaxrees> imo it's important because you can easily wind up with cases where you use other code to add/remove classes and suddenly wind up with a case like what i just showed.
[10:10:11] <stangeland> true that
[10:10:24] <stangeland> but here i am ONLY removing classes in one place
[10:10:30] <stangeland> its a minimize maximize case
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> i still don't like using implicit code for things like that, but whatever floats your boat.
[10:21:28] <wodim> hello, has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[10:21:35] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:24:14] <BillCriswell> wodim: Can we try that again.
[10:26:50] <robertmaxrees> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/has-anyone-really-been-far-even-as-decided-to-use-even-go-want-to-do-look-more-like
[10:29:44] <BillCriswell> What
[10:30:24] <robertmaxrees> old meme
[10:31:20] <BillCriswell> I must have missed this one.
[10:58:44] <mdev> such activities in here
[10:59:14] <BillCriswell> mdev: So much room for activities.
[10:59:29] <robertmaxrees> are people out today or something?
[10:59:33] <mdev> heh
[10:59:44] <mdev> robert probably have a case of the Mondays :p
[10:59:50] <robertmaxrees> hah
[11:35:30] <kal_crunchbang> Hi their, this code does not load the img that i want --> http://pastebin.com/jS8Y1W0k
[11:35:37] <kal_crunchbang> any ideas?
[11:35:58] <kal_crunchbang> alerts 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, ETC
[11:36:10] <robertmaxrees> what do you expect it do it?
[11:36:15] <robertmaxrees> *expect it to do
[11:36:45] <kal_crunchbang> its meant to be a gallery and show the next img on the list every 2.5 secounds
[11:37:03] <robertmaxrees> and what is it doing now?
[11:37:17] <cjohnson> .load is for reading ajax requests not for changing the src
[11:37:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:37:47] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you want .prop('src', pic[i]) instead
[11:38:01] <kal_crunchbang> ok
[11:41:07] <latestbot> I am using bootstrap dropdown, is there anyway, I can get the text of the focused <li>?
[11:41:21] <robertmaxrees> does it have a special class or anything?
[11:42:24] <mvpgraff> Is there a channel for Foundation?
[11:42:52] <latestbot> let me check?
[11:43:20] <robertmaxrees> mvpgraff try #zurb-foundation
[11:44:13] <latestbot> Not really
[11:44:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?  does bootstrap apply any special styling or anything?
[11:45:04] <robertmaxrees> you can use http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[11:45:06] <robertmaxrees> though it's slow.
[11:45:15] <latestbot> It just has role=“presentation”
[11:45:31] <mvpgraff> Maybe you can help. Have you used the tabs it brings recently? http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/tabs.html robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:45:51] <robertmaxrees> mvpgraff nope - i don't use foundation.
[11:46:06] <mvpgraff> Kk thanks! : p
[11:46:09] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, feel free to ask and provide a test case, but don't expect anybody in here to be able to answer.
[11:46:55] <latestbot> Essentially I am trying to write a unit test f
[11:47:45] <cjohnson> latestbot: then [role=presentation] will match it
[11:48:22] <robertmaxrees> imo avoid selecting on attributes that aren't ids or classes, though if it's just a unit test that should be ok.
[11:48:28] <latestbot> yeah
[11:48:28] <robertmaxrees> it'll just be a little slower than usual.
[11:48:32] <latestbot> let’s try
[11:49:24] <BillCriswell> It looks like there's an open class, at least on this one here: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-vertical
[11:49:43] <robertmaxrees> prolly.  trying to understand the "focused" part of that question.
[11:49:58] <BillCriswell> I'd think just opened.
[11:50:05] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[11:52:16] <stangeland> i can do $(this).find('input').hide() which works great. is there any way i can do find <input> AND <select> elements?
[11:52:54] <BillCriswell> stangeland: ,
[11:53:00] <latestbot> So I tried this, ($("li[role='presentation']").is(':focus').text()
[11:53:08] <latestbot> But it gives me an error
[11:53:40] <BillCriswell> latestbot: .is() returns a boolean.
[11:53:54] <latestbot> damn
[11:53:58] <latestbot> forgot
[11:54:17] <stangeland> BillCriswell, thanks
[11:54:49] <BillCriswell> stangeland: If you have to select textarea and other things there's :input as well which grabs all input elements.
[11:55:08] <stangeland> BillCriswell, ohh thats even better
[11:55:51] <BillCriswell> latestbot: Do you want the element that is active in the whole document?
[11:56:24] <latestbot> Well, let me explain my issue, I submitted a PR for an issue few days back
[11:56:48] <latestbot> Which also needs a unit test written for it
[11:57:08] <latestbot> This was my PR https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/15281
[11:57:41] <latestbot> I just need to check if on keydown the element with “.disabled” class gets skipped or not
[12:01:18] <mvpgraff> robertmaxrees Nvm, thanks I found the issue lol... Somehow there was a different character of " in my code ~_~
[12:01:28] <robertmaxrees> That's actually semi common,
[12:01:37] <robertmaxrees> some applications like to apply "smart quotes"
[12:01:53] <mvpgraff> lol
[12:03:59] <BillCriswell> latestbot: I'm not following exactly I don't think but I think you'd want to see if document.activeElement is .disabled?
[12:05:04] <BillCriswell> ok(!$(document.activeElement).is('.disabled'), '.disabled is not focused'); maybe?
[12:05:15] <BillCriswell> I need to learn to write tests.
[12:10:27] <latestbot> yeah, that might work
[12:10:43] <latestbot> I am pretty embarrased that I am stuck on such a small thing -_-
[12:11:14] <robertmaxrees> it happens sometimes.
[12:11:54] <BillCriswell> I only seem to get stuck on small things.
[12:15:30] <latestbot> Though through BillCriswell’s method, my test is passing :p
[12:15:38] <latestbot> I am not sure if that is good enough or not
[12:18:28] <BillCriswell> latestbot: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/tests/unit/dropdown.js#L32 is it related to this?
[12:19:20] <latestbot> I didn’t write this one
[12:19:33] <latestbot> But yeah kinda related
[12:21:10] <BillCriswell> I'd just try to base it off one of those.
[12:21:21] <latestbot> and it’s passing for ok(!$("li[role='presentation']:focus").is('.disabled'),"yes" ) too
[12:59:40] <graphettion> I have a back to top scroller. I want it to appear when it's greater than 100px. I have that and it works propery. But when I click the links, it keeps fading in and out when it's past 100px. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/atzx2s27/
[13:02:58] <Zzaichik> graphettion: it's because every time you click one of those buttons, it triggers the window scroll event.
[13:03:37] <graphettion> Ah, I've tried 'html, body'
[13:10:20] <Zzaichik> graphettion: it's doing what it's told to do - it's fading it in.
[13:10:32] <Zzaichik> That means, it's going from opacity 0 to opacity 1.
[13:12:19] <graphettion> I still don't understand. I guess I'll research.
[13:12:33] <robertmaxrees> what was the question?
[13:12:48] <Zzaichik> never mind, I figured it out - it's the default action of the links.
[13:13:15] <graphettion> Ah.
[13:13:17] <Zzaichik> graphettion: for the links at the top of the page, in their click events you need to prevent default action
[13:13:20] <graphettion> That makes sense.
[13:13:21] <graphettion> My bad.
[13:13:35] <graphettion> Errr!
[13:15:34] <latestbot> So my unit test got added as well
[13:15:48] <latestbot> My first OSS contribution is complete :D
[13:16:21] <graphettion> Zzaichik: Thank you! I appreciate the help.
[13:16:41] <Zzaichik> no problem! :)
[13:35:38] <BillCriswell> latestbot: Sweeeet
[13:35:51] <latestbot> Thanks to you, sir!
[13:37:49] <athan> Would jQuery's event system be good for implementing an internal application's communication architecture, or will it's events pollute in the DOM?
[13:38:24] <BillCriswell> latestbot: Glad my guess on how to do something was right haha
[13:38:27] <athan> Ideally I'd like the events namespaced to be available only to my application's class objects & things
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> athan your question seems a little unusual.
[13:39:04] <robertmaxrees> you'd traditionally use jquery events for the frontend.
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> though you can namespace them just fine, i'm confused about how youyr backend and frontend would pollute one another.
[13:39:33] <athan> robertmaxrees: I've got to implement a UX without any more dependencies
[13:39:43] <athan> and so far, organizing the UX into classes seems the best
[13:40:40] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use events as a way to do messaging between components?
[13:40:45] <athan> The backend event system is for form validation - when a set of fields are valid, (in my eyes) they trigger events that listeners (like a disabled "next" button, or disabled nav button) can respond to
[13:41:05] <athan> robertmaxrees: Yes, I am, but I don't want the component structure tied to the DOM
[13:41:06] <robertmaxrees> you're munging your separations of concern - your backend is not in the browser.
[13:41:17] <athan> or a particular heirarchy of components
[13:41:46] <athan> - I don't want event bubbling to be in the picture
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to do a lot of hacky stuff for that then.
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd consider doing something a little more purely functional instead
[13:42:16] <robertmaxrees> and explicitly call thingds.
[13:42:18] <athan> I'd ideally like a specific, absolute sense of which components are connected, without worrying about their DOM layout
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> *things
[13:42:35] <athan> robertmaxrees: Thanks :)
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> in that case, events aren't a very good choice since there's an inherent tie to elements at that point.
[13:43:32] <athan> robertmaxrees: I want that tie, though :(
[13:43:46] <robertmaxrees> you just said you don't want the structure tied to the DOM.
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> without bubbling
[13:44:18] <athan> The thing about this is that the system is reactive, it's hard to do FP stuff in raw js when you need simultaneous reaction between values
[13:44:25] <athan> kinda like mutual recursion
[13:44:43] <athan> robertmaxrees: Correct - I do not want the events tied to the _rest_ of the dom
[13:44:47] <athan> just particular elements
[13:44:56] <robertmaxrees> eh, i'd still do something more strictly functional.
[13:45:01] <athan> :s
[13:45:14] <robertmaxrees> using events means you're routing behavior through the DOM which always leads to problems.
[13:45:14] * athan fiddles
[13:45:25] <robertmaxrees> call logic explicitly instead.
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> have logic that updates things as required.
[13:46:09] <athan> robertmaxrees: Thank you :)
[13:46:26] <athan> robertmaxrees: How do you mean "update"?
[13:46:33] <athan> you mean like a $() query?
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:46:51] <robertmaxrees> whatever you want it to mean.  if you componentize things correctly, it could be anything.
[13:46:58] <athan> ~_~
[13:47:24] <robertmaxrees> it could be .text() calls, full on .html() calls, etc.
[13:47:38] <athan> robertmaxrees: But, what you _are_ saying is that jQuery's events can be used at the logic level, right?
[13:47:54] <robertmaxrees> errr, not necessarily.
[13:48:00] <robertmaxrees> you still have to bind listeners somewhere.
[13:48:00] <athan> in a namespaced way that's not interfering with the DOM?
[13:48:03] <athan> poooooo
[13:48:09] <athan> oh, that's okay
[13:48:11] <athan> OH
[13:48:14] <athan> that's what you mean
[13:48:33] <robertmaxrees> i would still avoid it - every time i see somebody going down that path, they end up regretting it.
[13:49:20] <athan> robertmaxrees: Maybe once I have some time to refactor this app, I'll have it compensate for flexability, but right now I just need a quick fix
[13:49:25] <athan> ideally I'd just go with backbone
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> what is the current problem you're solving for?
[13:50:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with React.js personally, but I don't like MVC soooo
[13:54:08] <BillCriswell> Vue is my homeboy.
[14:01:29] <tejas-manohar> http://i.imgur.com/d1hjngF.png
[14:01:35] <tejas-manohar> let me know whats up in that picture
[14:04:49] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: $ probably isn't jQuery.
[14:04:59] <tejas-manohar> oh
[14:05:20] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: Try typing $.fn.jquery and see if that returns a number.
[14:05:30] <BillCriswell> Well, a string, but you know what I mean.
[14:17:30] <Prometheian> I know I can use $.getScript to load a js file, but can I do the same with a css file?
[14:18:09] <Prometheian> Or do I just have to do $("head").append(myCSSFile)?
[14:21:26] <LindsayMac> does anyone know if the jquery date object knows what dates "this weekend" is?
[14:22:01] <Prometheian> You can find out using math
[14:22:48] <LindsayMac> Prometheian:  how?
[14:23:06] <LindsayMac> Prometheian:  find out which day of the week the current day is and move forward N days??
[14:23:19] <LindsayMac> Prometheian: I feel like jquery might have something like this though already done.. no?
[14:23:34] <Prometheian> Yeah, basically if day != saturday || sunday; day++; repeat
[14:23:38] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: not jquery, but date/time libs like http://momentjs.com/
[14:23:40] <Prometheian> I think javascript has something to handle that.
[14:24:03] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  was hoping that jquery had something
[14:24:16] <LindsayMac> I COULD do it in php but i'm deciding now which is best / fastest
[14:24:20] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: no, that's beyond jquery's scope.
[14:24:33] <LindsayMac> also since i'm doing it with an ajax query i'd like to keep it client side if i can
[14:24:34] <LindsayMac> ok
[14:24:36] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  thanks
[14:25:48] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  that script seems super useful since i'm making an event manager. nice
[14:25:58] <Prometheian> You'd have to do some annoying math with javascript's native bullshit, but new Date() gives "Mon Dec 15 2014 17:25:07 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)" for example
[14:26:07] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: its a great library
[14:26:48] <Prometheian> So new String(new Date()).substr(0, 3)
[14:27:27] <LindsayMac> Prometheian:  i know i can easily get today's date a number of ways.. I was hoping there was a library that found time 'bickets' like this weekend easily
[14:29:47] <kingfisher64> can someone kind help me with a basic text manipulation. I'm wanting to change the wording on an select dropdown option. I'm trying to reference #dropdown_layered_nav_product_brand option value "Any brand"
[14:30:12] <kingfisher64> to reword is to "Any Breed" rather than any brand (for a dogs website)
[14:30:34] <Prometheian> LindsayMac: I think moment js does
[14:30:40] <Prometheian> But I haven't touched it personally.
[14:34:06] <LindsayMac> Prometheian: looking into it .. its close
[14:35:09] <Prometheian> You could always use Date.now() to get your time from like jan 1 1970 or whatever the "beginning" date is, and calculate from there
[14:35:51] <LindsayMac> Prometheian:  yea that was the first suggestion and thought i had. I was hoping to not have to calculate if there was something out there.
[14:35:58] <LindsayMac> I dont like reinventing the wheel, so to say
[14:37:02] <Prometheian> Use C# :P
[14:37:14] <Prometheian> new DateTime().addDay(1) iirc
[14:37:29] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 share your code.
[14:39:06] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian did you get an answer about your original question?
[14:39:25] <LindsayMac> Prometheian: its a php powered environment.. not gonna go all out here ;) They arent paying me enough
[14:41:01] <Prometheian> robertmaxrees: I did not, but I'm doing head.append
[14:41:12] <Prometheian> LindsayMac, might be easier to do in backend then
[14:41:21] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian cool - css doesn't need to be "executed".  it works by virtue of existing.
[14:41:47] <LindsayMac> Prometheian:  well, running through JS wouldn't be bad since its an ajax query
[14:41:57] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac you want semantic datetime parsing, which is something you should really handle in your backend.
[14:42:15] <Prometheian> Do a post instead of a get, and use the returned data!
[14:42:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  and why not by something like moment?
[14:42:26] <LindsayMac> Prometheian: thats the other option.
[14:42:28] <robertmaxrees> does moment have knowledge of "this weekend"?
[14:42:30] <Prometheian> robertmaxrees: Cool, did not know! ty
[14:42:33] <LindsayMac> i was just trying to deicde which..
[14:42:40] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i am looking to see if it does,  but I believe so
[14:42:45] <LindsayMac> it deals with weekdays and weekends.
[14:42:50] <kingfisher64> it's okay it's done robertmaxrees. a friend helped me as I wasn't sure I was going to get the answer   $("#dropdown_layered_nav_product_brand option:first-child").text("All Breeds");
[14:42:52] <robertmaxrees> right, but not "this weekend"
[14:43:07] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 ah.  why not change taht in your backend btw?
[14:43:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i havent read all the docs but logic would think if it could exclude this weekend it could get it
[14:43:23] <LindsayMac> I literally JUST got the link so I dont know
[14:43:41] <LindsayMac> and I know PHP doesn't have that just yet AFAIK .. i'm just feeling out my options honestly
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac i'm confused - is your use case that you want people to be able to type "this weekend"?
[14:44:19] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i have a drop down for "this weekend" "this week" "tomorrow" etc
[14:44:39] <Prometheian> Populate from backend, ajax that shit.
[14:44:39] <LindsayMac> choosing one will pass an ajax query to my PHP script that searches my events for the dates involved..
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy - generate all that correctly with your backend.
[14:44:53] <robertmaxrees> instead of with JS
[14:44:55] <LindsayMac> So basically I just need to know what dates exist in "this weekend" before I start querying
[14:45:08] <LindsayMac> i've already got the actual dates of the events stored and query-able
[14:45:10] <robertmaxrees> you should let your PHP handle that.
[14:45:24] <LindsayMac> i thought MAYBE JS could do it just because I was reading around on it.. but I guess php is the best way.
[14:45:29] <LindsayMac> thats the initial way I was gonna do it
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> it could do it, but it's smarter to handle that in your backend.
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> and it'll be easier, too.
[14:45:55] <LindsayMac> okee dokee
[14:46:01] <LindsayMac> thats why i asked
[14:48:11] <Prometheian> I think the big issue here is the use of PHP at all, but that's me. ;)
[14:48:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:48:51] <robertmaxrees> php has a time and a place.
[14:49:07] <kingfisher64> robertmaxrees: don't know how!
[14:49:13] <kingfisher64> lack of skill?!!!
[14:49:26] <LindsayMac> PHP is fine.
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:50:02] <LindsayMac> its fine for certain things
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> i was saying "wat" about kingfisher64 because dude is weird.
[14:50:53] <LindsayMac> ah ok
[15:42:52] <bkboggy> do any of you guys know what frameworks were used to create Twitch and the new YouTube apps?
[15:43:11] <robertmaxrees> "the new youtube apps"?
[15:43:29] <bkboggy> "apps" was used for twitch and youtube conjunction
[15:43:31] <robertmaxrees> and twitch?  i'm confused.
[15:43:36] <bkboggy> but yes, YouTube appears to have a new look on their app
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> their mobile app?
[15:43:49] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: what are you confused about?  Twitch has an app
[15:43:49] <blackkbot> new look all together
[15:43:56] <bkboggy> blackkbot: Yes
[15:44:09] <robertmaxrees> you're asking in the jquery channel what framework a mobile app is using >.>
[15:44:17] <bkboggy> i don't know what other channel to use
[15:44:21] <blackkbot> less menus and more of a pain to get around on ... yay youtube
[15:44:37] <bkboggy> blackkbot: I like it... hmm
[15:44:50] <blackkbot> change frightens and confuses me
[15:44:59] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: and you're in jquery channel?
[15:45:04] <bkboggy> mt
[15:45:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:45:09] <bkboggy> blackkbot: and you're in jquery channel?
[15:45:15] <blackkbot> am i now?
[15:45:16] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: mistell
[15:45:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:45:34] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: you appear to be dazed and confused
[15:45:47] * bkboggy backs away slowly
[15:45:56] <blackkbot> alright alright alright
[15:46:07] <robertmaxrees> i just don't understand the logic behind coming in here to ask what frameworks the youtube mobile app is using hahaha
[15:46:17] <blackkbot> you got some jquery? you'd be a lot cooler if you did
[15:46:37] <bkboggy> blackkbot: i sure do
[15:46:54] <bkboggy> $('#socool')
[15:47:26] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: i just don't understand the logic of asking that sort of question, after i explained that I didn't know a better place
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> because that doesn't change the topic of this channel;.
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[15:47:52] <blackkbot> good point but ##javascript would be more appropriate
[15:47:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:48:06] <bkboggy> blackkbot: right on, i'll try there
[15:48:23] <blackkbot> and ill tell you to go away there ;p
[15:48:26] <robertmaxrees> (he's being funny)
[15:48:30] <bkboggy> lol
[15:48:43] <bkboggy> no funny...
[15:48:44] <blackkbot> they won't help but the might recognize it
[15:48:47] * bkboggy sobs..
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> http://developer.android.com/support.html
[15:49:31] <bkboggy> why would i care about android?  both apps were clearly created using a js/html-friendly framework
[15:49:37] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:49:45] <robertmaxrees> because perhaps somebody in one of those channels knows.
[15:50:03] <bkboggy> well, what makes you think that they wouldn't say the same thing about this channel?
[15:50:03] <blackkbot> maybe theres a youtube video about it
[15:50:10] <bkboggy> blackkbot: actually looked, nope
[15:50:23] <blackkbot> thats hard to believe
[15:50:35] <bkboggy> yeah
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> bkboggy because you're asking about how they made an app.
[15:50:38] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[15:50:39] <bkboggy> become a bliever
[15:50:50] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: which means what?
[15:51:00] <blackkbot> this is jquery not appquery
[15:51:12] <robertmaxrees> you could go to a channel dedicated to app development and ask there for information.
[15:51:14] <bkboggy> so?  we're all playing for the same team
[15:51:15] <robertmaxrees> perhaps they know.
[15:51:18] <nerium> Is there a say to set focus on the last element in this list? http://jsfiddle.net/vu5xavhg/
[15:51:32] <nerium> I want to scroll down to that particular element
[15:51:36] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: i'll do that
[15:51:39] <greengriminal> Given I am using jQuery sortable I noticed that when you click on an item it adds <li class='ui-state-highlight'>..</li>
[15:51:44] <robertmaxrees> "hey you'll probably have more luck over in this other place" is what we're saying.
[15:52:10] <robertmaxrees> nerium do you want to scroll to that element or focus on it?
[15:52:17] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: can't fault me for playing the spray and pray game, higher chance of success
[15:52:20] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Scroll to it
[15:52:30] <robertmaxrees> bkboggy actually, I can ;)
[15:52:33] <nerium> robertmaxrees: I want it to be vissble
[15:52:37] <blackkbot> document.body.firstElementChild.scrollIntoView() or the last element
[15:52:37] <bkboggy> robertmaxrees: and you do ;)
[15:52:38] <greengriminal> In other words what I want to do is create a div inside the li when the item is clicked on
[15:53:17] <greengriminal> I was wondering this may be possible with using the helper property
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> nerium you could use .last() to get the final li, get its scrollTop(), and then set the scrollTop() of the entire container.
[15:54:29] <nerium> robertmaxrees: I've already tried that. scrollTop calculates the distance to the top,
[15:54:50] <blackkbot> scrollIntoView() on the element
[15:56:13] <robertmaxrees> nerium http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vu5xavhg/1/
[15:59:24] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Hehe, that worked. Thanks!
[16:00:23] <blackkbot> $('div').scrollTop($('ul li').last()[0].scrollIntoView()); works too but yeah its longer
[16:00:46] <robertmaxrees> you could also use .get(0) instead of [0] if you wanted :)
[16:01:02] <blackkbot> ehh im just now learning to use jquery
[16:01:10] <robertmaxrees> ah that's why.
[16:01:12] <blackkbot> i see the 0 object when i dir the funciton
[16:01:27] <robertmaxrees> aye - .get() is the more "jquery way" of fetching that object.
[16:03:07] <blackkbot> it doesn't make sense to me that last() wouldn't return an object
[16:03:14] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[16:03:24] <blackkbot> yeah at [0]
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> [-1] actually.
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> (if that were to be a thing)
[16:16:58] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Hmm, it din't work. Try scrolling down to the bottom first http://jsfiddle.net/vu5xavhg/2/
[16:20:44] <nerium> Does anyone else know how to solve this? I need to set focus on an element in a scroll div
[16:20:45] <nerium> http://jsfiddle.net/vu5xavhg/2/
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> focus has nothing to do with what you want?
[16:28:24] <mdev> jquery should be built into browsers
[16:28:26] <mdev> who's with me?
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> not i
[16:30:11] <mdev> robert
[16:30:12] <mdev> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:30:20] <BinaryKitten> Nor I
[16:30:22] <mdev> I may still email google/mozilla and make it happen
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> fix the DOM instead.
[16:30:33] <mdev> just trying to speed up the web...no big deal
[16:31:01] <BinaryKitten> including a 3rd party js script into a browser will only slow things down, not speed it up
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason we need jquery is because browser vendors refuse to agree on things.
[16:31:21] <mdev> 100% speed up, because it could be native compiled or something
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> reread what I said ;)
[16:31:55] <mdev> well jquery works with all modern browers even IE
[16:32:03] <BinaryKitten> mdev i don't believe you know the impact of what you're asking
[16:32:10] <blackkbot> jquery handles the browsers for you and the code remains the same
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> right, and exists because browser vendors don't agree on standards.
[16:32:18] <BinaryKitten> but sure, if you want to.. go ahead and email google/mozilla
[16:32:21] <mdev> so if chrome came with it built in, native compile it or whatever, it could speed up jquery related stuff a lot
[16:32:37] <mdev> and give option to disable the native browser version if you insist on third party url version
[16:32:42] <mdev> best of both worlds
[16:32:58] <robertmaxrees> mdev why?
[16:33:05] <mdev> I have a combobox with 42k entries and jquery/browsers struggle hard atm
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> why not fix the browsers proper in that case?
[16:33:17] <mdev> what do you mean by fix the browsers proper?
[16:33:18] <blackkbot> no joke
[16:33:29] <BinaryKitten> a select with 42,000 entries?
[16:33:31] <mdev> jquery utilitizes javascript in an awesome way
[16:33:36] <mdev> Binary yup
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> mdev the reason we have jquery is to a) fill in cross-browser issues and b) abstract out the DOM.
[16:33:50] <BinaryKitten> i think you might need to rethink your stategy there..
[16:33:54] <blackkbot> since we have a magic wand to fix all browsers why not just update to es6 across the board
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> though b is becoming less and less of an issue.
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> blackkbot because ES6 has nothing to do with the DOM ;)
[16:34:12] <BinaryKitten> 42,000 elements will slow any page .. native compiled jQuery or nopt
[16:34:16] <mdev> Binary nah it's what the client wants, all the info loaded, not my fault browsers slow
[16:34:25] <blackkbot> yes but jquery is more than dom
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> blackkbot wat
[16:34:40] <blackkbot> every?
[16:34:46] <blackkbot> iterations
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> it has some utils built in, sure.
[16:35:09] <robertmaxrees> nerium how does the code you pasted not work?
[16:35:37] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Try scrolling down to the bottom of the list and wait for the callback to kick in
[16:35:51] <mdev> I use to write in raw js, was dumb
[16:36:01] <mdev> lot of messy code to cater to various browsers
[16:36:04] <blackkbot> you probably did it wrong
[16:36:05] <mdev> ajax being an example
[16:36:25] <robertmaxrees> nerium works fine >.>
[16:36:28] <mdev> blackbot ha funny you jump right to I must have been at fault
[16:36:31] <robertmaxrees> i think I see what you're talking about.
[16:36:35] <robertmaxrees> nerium one sec.
[16:36:39] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Cool :)
[16:36:51] <blackkbot> thats usually the problem mdev
[16:37:12] <blackkbot> tho yeah ajax is a pain
[16:37:14] <mdev> nah everything useful it seems like in raw js is retarded
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> not imo.
[16:37:32] <mdev> I once had to select a combobox or something and the line of code was insanely long
[16:37:35] <robertmaxrees> "raw js" (read: raw DOM) is getting easier all the time.
[16:37:36] <blackkbot> vanilla fwiw
[16:37:41] <mdev> where as jquery it was short and sweet
[16:37:47] <blackkbot> somewhat
[16:38:07] <blackkbot> but you can't predict what specific lines of code will do where as with javascript its more explicit
[16:38:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:38:18] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> nerium http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vu5xavhg/3/
[16:38:44] <blackkbot> no i can give you a line of code and its not clear what it does...  without context
[16:38:48] <blackkbot> of course context is everything
[16:39:05] <mdev> jquery is just beautiful, amazing all it does in such small amount of code
[16:39:08] <robertmaxrees> you can do that in JS and with jQuery
[16:39:12] <robertmaxrees> blackkbot
[16:39:15] <mdev> whoever created it is a legit dev for sure
[16:39:23] <blackkbot> resig
[16:39:25] <robertmaxrees> mdev lol it's a lot of people that work on it.
[16:39:39] <nerium> robertmaxrees: The problem is that the elements in the list are dynamicly loaded, so there isn't any good way to pre load their position
[16:39:40] <blackkbot> he went to RIT...
[16:39:42] <mdev> yeah but i'm sure there was just 1 guy/gal initally
[16:39:49] <mdev> that brought it to life
[16:39:50] <blackkbot> yeah resig
[16:39:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:40:11] <robertmaxrees> nerium sure there is.
[16:40:28] <nerium> robertmaxrees: How?
[16:40:31] <robertmaxrees> position
[16:41:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vu5xavhg/5/
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> mdev if browser vendors were to try to incorporate jquery into the browser natively, why not just fix the current problems with the DOM as-is?
[16:43:13] <blackkbot> because fixing things isn't what they do
[16:43:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> so why integrate jquery?
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:43:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a waste of time imo.
[16:43:54] <blackkbot> not their responsibility
[16:44:14] <robertmaxrees> it's not the chrome teams' responsibility to fix chrome?
[16:44:16] <blackkbot> well except when it doesn't fit to the spec
[16:44:42] <blackkbot> they all developed their browsers at the same time before they had a standard
[16:44:51] <robertmaxrees> no they didn't.
[16:44:59] <blackkbot> liek the css rules
[16:45:18] <blackkbot> webkit-bla bla
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> IE/Netscape, netscape became Mozilla, webkit became a thing.
[16:45:30] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[16:45:39] <blackkbot> but these are living things
[16:45:42] <robertmaxrees> and the standard is much older than you thing.
[16:45:43] <blackkbot> they are constantly being updated
[16:45:45] <robertmaxrees> *think
[16:45:54] <mdev> I don't see kekscore in ban list
[16:46:11] <robertmaxrees> err, the WHATWG spec is getting updated regularly, blackkbot
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> mdev okay?
[16:46:59] <mdev> err sorry wrong channel
[17:09:24] <robertmaxrees> http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-in-javascript/ interesting to read this almost 10 years after the fact.
[17:17:08] <GeekDude> Something I've never understood. What's the point of document onload?
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> it waits for all assets to have loaded.
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> handy when you need to account for images.
[17:17:43] <GeekDude> While normally they won'tve all loaded?
[17:17:51] <GeekDude> won't've? wont've?
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> Wouldnt've
[17:18:05] <robertmaxrees> compared to what though?
[17:18:47] <GeekDude> Is there any point to using onload when you're code doesn't depend on if the external assets have loaded yet?
[17:19:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> 1st off, it'd be $(window).load(), not document.
[17:19:30] <GeekDude> see, I'm very bad at jqurey
[17:19:40] <GeekDude> oh come on, I can't even type straight now >.<
[17:19:43] <robertmaxrees> 2nd, people sometimes use it as a way to work around an invalid document
[17:20:47] <GeekDude> $(document).ready(function() { });
[17:21:09] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[17:21:41] <GeekDude> I just don't clearly see when it's necessary and it isn't
[17:22:08] <Robdgreat> GeekDude: anytime you need to act on an element and thus need to make sure it's loaded when the code executes
[17:22:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, the document ready?
[17:22:32] <robertmaxrees> document ready is when you want to js in your <head> and have it act on elements in your markup.
[17:22:37] <GeekDude> Does javascript often run before the DOM is all there?
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> if it's in the <head>, yes
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> document ready makes it wait/.
[17:23:01] <GeekDude> huh, I thought javascript ran after the DOM loaded
[17:23:12] <robertmaxrees> if you put it before your closing body tag it does.
[17:23:18] <blackkbot> javascript runs in order
[17:24:12] <blackkbot> unless you put the code to execute on an event
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> then the binding runs in order :)
[17:24:34] <blackkbot> right
[17:25:35] <GeekDude> so my `$("img").click(function() { });` doesn't need to be in the $(document).ready bit
[17:25:50] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[17:25:52] <blackkbot> sure or after the img element exists
[17:25:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:26:01] <blackkbot> like at the bottom of the body
[17:26:04] <GeekDude> "unless you put the code to execute on an event" ?
[17:26:14] <GeekDude> Then I'm confused as to what that sentence implies
[17:26:23] <blackkbot> its either or
[17:26:30] <GeekDude> as in <tag onclick="javascript()">?
[17:26:45] <blackkbot> id really rather you never do that
[17:26:49] <GeekDude> lol
[17:27:24] <blackkbot> i mean it will work but it will confuse the hell out of you eventually
[17:28:24] <GeekDude> Javascript goes in the .js file, css in the .css file, and html in the .html file
[17:28:32] <GeekDude> so on so forth
[17:28:52] <blackkbot> thats usually a friendly way to do it
[17:30:42] <robertmaxrees> GeekDude basically.
[17:30:46] <robertmaxrees> here's the deal -
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> looking at this code: $('img').on('click', function() { console.log('ohai') });
[17:31:32] <GeekDude> make all image tags log to the console
[17:31:36] <GeekDude> when clicked
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> this is an event binding - the important part on pageload is the $('img').on(); - the img must exist for the binding to happen.
[17:31:49] <blackkbot> on click of the tag it logs to the console
[17:32:29] <robertmaxrees> the code in the binding (the function() {} bit) runs when stuff is clicked - that part doesn't rely on the document ready.
[17:32:36] <GeekDude> if I were to put that in a script tag halfway down the body, would only the top half have the binding applied, or would it apply to all items?
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> just the part where you bind to the element.
[17:32:54] <robertmaxrees> you could only guarantee that the first half would get the binding.
[17:33:07] <GeekDude> but web browsers do crazy stuff
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> don't rely on them.
[17:33:29] <GeekDude> that's why we use jquery!
[17:33:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't get past the event binding part though.
[17:34:00] <blackkbot> you can do addEventListener('click',function(e){if(e.target.tagName ==='IMG')console.log(e.target);});
[17:34:14] <GeekDude> That just screams ugly to my retina
[17:34:26] <Robdgreat> !
[17:35:27] <blackkbot> it doesn't bypass the binding it just binds the function to the click event on the window and then checks to see if the target is an img tag
[17:35:32] <blackkbot> and its not jquery
[17:36:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:36:06] <GeekDude> yeah, but that's a really ugly and inefficient way of doing things, isn't it?
[17:36:14] <robertmaxrees> "ugly", maybe.
[17:36:14] <blackkbot> depends
[17:36:15] <Robdgreat> GeekDude: as opposed to what?
[17:36:18] <robertmaxrees> inefficient, sort of.
[17:36:25] <Robdgreat> delegation is prettier
[17:36:28] <blackkbot> depends on how many elements you are listening to for clicks
[17:36:49] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat that's what he's using there.
[17:36:52] <robertmaxrees> just the native JS version.
[17:37:00] <robertmaxrees> you could do something similar with jquery.
[17:37:02] <Robdgreat> jquery delegation is prettier :P
[17:37:08] <blackkbot> somewhat...
[17:38:19] <robertmaxrees> i think it is.
[17:38:28] <robertmaxrees> though i wouldn't bind to window ever
[17:38:30] <blackkbot> jquerys is more like the do onevents events
[17:38:36] <robertmaxrees> if I can avoid it.
[17:38:50] <blackkbot> you don't put big functions on the window events
[17:38:56] <robertmaxrees> *anything
[17:39:03] <robertmaxrees> don't bind delegated listeners to window.
[17:47:09] <blackkbot> but with the dom controls like getElementsByTagName/ClassName you get a live object that updates when the dom is updated then if you check that 'array like' object against the event target or the document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX,event.clientY) you don't have to rerun any checks on the dom or anything.. its pretty clean except for the whole arraylike objects not having iteration functions
[17:47:09] <blackkbot> that just requires you call the Array.prototype iteration functions using .call or .apply
[17:47:20] <blackkbot> but yeah you could bind to the document rather than window
[17:48:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying don't bind that far up period.
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> bind lower.
[17:49:13] <robertmaxrees> i prefer the jquery selectors and leveraging jquery methods more.
[17:49:22] <robertmaxrees> but that's just me.  we're also in #jquery soooo ;)
[17:49:26] <GeekDude> :D
[17:49:35] <GeekDude> I think I might idle in here more often
[17:49:38] <robertmaxrees> granted you can use querySelectorAll()
[17:49:43] <robertmaxrees> but then you don't get .on()
[17:50:46] <blackkbot> well you get jQuery.on.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),'click',function(){console.log($(this));});
[17:50:49] <blackkbot> right?
[17:50:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> why would i do that?
[17:51:06] <blackkbot> why would you type querySelectorAll?
[17:51:10] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't.
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> if you have jquery, use it.
[17:51:21] <robertmaxrees> do so idiomatically.
[17:51:49] <blackkbot> but the live objects of getElementsByTagName have functions that can optimize
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:52:06] <blackkbot> meh
[17:52:09] <robertmaxrees> whatevs mang
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> either use jquery or don't.
[17:52:21] <blackkbot> oh im trying to im just stuck in vanialla
[17:52:23] <blackkbot> vanilla
[17:52:23] <robertmaxrees> not really sure why you're in here if you're going to basically say "don't use jquery"
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:52:42] <blackkbot> im not saying don't i just think vanilla is just as easy
[17:52:55] <blackkbot> aside from ajax and whatnot
[17:53:01] <GeekDude> "encodeURIComponent" is quite a mouthful
[17:53:04] <blackkbot> the .css is cool
[17:53:54] <blackkbot> quite whats the jquery version?
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> of encodeURICOmponent?
[17:54:24] <blackkbot> yeah. is there one?
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> ... nope.
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> why would there be?
[17:54:34] <blackkbot> or is that all backend
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> that's built-in
[17:58:16] <GeekDude> It's amazing the internet even works
[17:58:33] <GeekDude> especially as often as it does
[17:59:44] <blackkbot> yeah the series of tubes is really impressive
[18:00:09] <GeekDude> "Nobody agrees on quite how to do anything, but it all gets done anyways somehow"
[18:00:19] <blackkbot> lol a lot like hardware too
[18:01:08] <GeekDude> I'm rather interested in the fact that hamburgers generally fit together pretty well, even if you buy your hamburger ingredients from different people
[18:02:05] <blackkbot> idk hamburger ingredients don't really fit together they just sorta lay on top of one another
[18:02:15] <blackkbot> and sometimes barely that
[18:04:18] <GeekDude> If I wanted to spread my GET request across multiple lines, such that each key=value pair got its own line, is there a preferred syntax?
[18:05:29] <blackkbot> ? you mean the form or the object that contains the key value pairs
[18:06:51] <GeekDude> I'm just not familiar with jquery. I can just pass an object into the .ajax() function can't I
[18:07:27] <GeekDude> or not, I really have no idea
[18:07:55] <blackkbot> sounds correct to me
[18:08:06] <blackkbot> the whole request is in one object
[18:08:37] <GeekDude> data: {thing: "one", thing2: "two", thing3: $("#myID").value }
[18:08:57] <mdev> jquery needs an html mode
[18:09:11] <mdev> for ajax stuff, where it auto escaped incomming data
[18:09:27] <mdev> tired of parsejson breaking/whining unless I escape before it lands there
[18:11:42] <blackkbot> $() handles html
[18:11:44] <blackkbot> i thought
[18:13:38] <mdev> eh?
[18:13:41] <blackkbot> $('<script>var data = {a:"a"};</script>')
[18:14:05] <mdev> herm, i'll have to test that
[18:14:07] <mdev> thanks
[18:54:18] <blackkbot> is key supposed to be set to *@195.88.209.243?
[18:54:24] <blackkbot> chan mode
[18:55:28] <GeekDude> lol
[18:55:56] <GeekDude> he was trying to kick someone
[18:55:59] <GeekDude> [08:34] * robertmaxrees sets mode: +b *!*@195.88.209.243
[18:55:59] <GeekDude> [08:34] * robertmaxrees sets mode: +k *!*@195.88.209.243
[18:56:01] <blackkbot> yeah
[18:56:06] <blackkbot> its not supposed to be
[19:37:02] <vladikoff> KindOne, what's the deal
[19:37:34] <blackkbot> just repeating myself there shouldn't be a key here
[19:38:29] <KindOne> vladikoff, /mode #jquery -k

[19:45:50] <AcidRain2012> http://jsfiddle.net/pttmkjr9/5/ can anyone help me with this?
[19:45:59] <AcidRain2012> trying to set the text of updatetext
[19:47:06] <cjohnson> they come flooding in
[19:48:45] <jotterbot> hey guys, is there a way to test if a ZeroClipboard instance has already been applied to an element?
[19:48:45] <morficus> AcidRain2012: can you elaborate on what you are trying to do that is not working?
[19:48:53] <cjohnson> your line 7 isn't right AcidRain2012
[19:48:57] <cjohnson> it's not returning an element
[19:49:03] <jotterbot> i want to assign a ZeroClipboard instance only if one doesn't already exist
[19:49:04] <AcidRain2012> yea i just found this out
[20:22:04] <spudzee> how can I use the <input> tag to get a value typed in from the user into string format in jquery?
[20:22:45] <Velveeta> $('input').val()
[20:23:18] <Velveeta> replace $('input') with some unique identifier of that input, $('#myInput') or $('#email') or whatever... .val()
[20:23:51] <blackkbot> $('input:active').val()?
[20:25:16] <Velveeta> i don't active denotes an element being clicked down upon doesn't it?
[20:25:22] <Velveeta> maybe $('input:focus').val()
[20:30:44] <spudzee> I have a hard time understanding <input>
[20:33:23] <GeekDude> it's a strange tag
[21:11:24] <sodacrunch> hi, when you have a bunch of elements with same class, and you did a jquery statement when its clicked, if you use "this" doesnt it only apply to that element and not all elements with that same class?
[21:16:42] <cjohnson> sodacrunch: need more details. can you paste your code?
[21:17:12] <cjohnson> if you bound with .on, the listener is only called once per element, and only for one element (this)
[21:18:09] <cjohnson> if you do $('.foo').on('click', bar) it will call bar once per click, on all elements with class="foo"
[21:18:26] <cjohnson> this will refer to just the clicked element, not everything in $('.foo')
[21:18:37] <cjohnson> jquery docs for .on are a good place to read up
[21:26:13] <sodacrunch> cjohnson, made an example http://jsfiddle.net/bhsez2wd/4/ see this, on how there are 2 stories, both have "SHARE" and if you click it, it alerts a unique url/text?
[21:28:31] <Uhkis> my god :D parent().parent().parent().parent()
[21:29:10] <sodacrunch> I think I figured it out
[21:29:16] <sodacrunch> lol
[21:34:51] <Uhkis> sodacrunch: http://jsfiddle.net/bhsez2wd/5/ how about this instead
[21:36:48] <sodacrunch> Uhkis, whoa m8 it worked, thanks! much better, and your name makes me think or Urkel, do you know him
[21:37:15] <cjohnson> ideally closest over parents
[21:37:23] <cjohnson> more explicitly just one item
[21:40:04] <Uhkis> sodacrunch: nope
[21:41:31] <sodacrunch> Uhkis, what?! you dont recall URKEL?!?!?!
[21:41:40] <sodacrunch> http://i.imgur.com/98Ql2OU.gif
[21:41:42] <sodacrunch> thats him
[21:43:29] <Uhkis> i'm guessing they didn't show family matters in finland
[22:06:52] <blackhajime> anyone using fuelux ?
[23:37:16] <kuil09> hi
