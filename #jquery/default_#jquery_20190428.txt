[06:56:36] <Jasein> what is the current best method for handling resizing events to avoid the delayed and mulitple calls? is there a preferred dethrottle or debounce or ?
[07:30:35] <mikkeloscar> Hi, I'm writing a tampermonkey script to insert a link in a single page app (Google Chat) when you hover over certain threads. In short I have this: $("c-wiz[data-topic-id]").hover(function() { /*do things*/}
[07:31:58] <mikkeloscar> It works fine when I first load the page, but when I switch rooms the event no longer fires which I assume is because the DOM has been updated and new elements matching "c-wiz[data-topic-id]" are not picked up. What is the correct way to handle this use case?
[13:04:00] <spinningCat> anyone here use that plugin http://www.turnjs.com/
[14:09:08] <spinningCat> i found this example for flipbook http://jsfiddle.net/sach_a/r9o076xf/ but that seems menually handle something is there a better way to accompolish this?
[14:38:54] <destramic> ive taken tooltip hide and show from bootstrap....but for some reason my css wont work with the tooltip   https://jsfiddle.net/ehtku5cg/1/    anyone please?
[14:43:40] <Jasein> How can I calculate the distributed space between items in flexbox justify-content:space-between?
[14:44:45] <spinningCat> i think the distance in space-between depends on the width of container
[14:45:28] <spinningCat> you should check the width of element and calculate the space accordingly
[14:45:33] <Jasein> thanks for replying. I tried comparing the width of the container to the sum of item widths and it's constant on resizing.
[14:45:58] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/OGrwxe?editors=1111
[14:46:01] <spinningCat> for example width is 100px and you have 2 elements width is 12 px
[14:46:05] <spinningCat> 15px
[14:46:20] <spinningCat> the space filled by element is 30px and rest space is 70px
[14:46:27] <spinningCat> that must be mathematical calculation
[14:46:36] <Jasein> sure that makes logical sense, but it's not working like that for some reason.
[14:46:45] <spinningCat> ah well
[14:46:58] <spinningCat> in box model there must be some padding, margin etc.
[14:47:33] <spinningCat> i dont know exact method for calculating width of element i mean with + padding + margin + something else
[14:47:48] <spinningCat> you may want to use box-sizing: border-box if you didnt use that
[14:48:20] <spinningCat> also the calculation can change depends on unit you use like px, %, viewport units
[14:49:40] <spinningCat> i think it is more like css question
[14:51:01] <Jasein> what's strange is that I can shrink the page so it's about 300px wide and the container width and sum of the items width is still 450 and 730....
[14:52:45] <Jasein> What I am trying to do is tell when the window is too small to display all of the menu items. If it can show more than half of the menu items, then I want to be able to scroll the menu. Less than half-change to dropdown
[14:54:00] <spinningCat> as i said earlier calculation migght depend on unit you use
[14:54:05] <spinningCat> i am not expert on that ofc
[14:54:54] <spinningCat> you should ask that in css channel
[14:55:10] <Jasein> in jquery the calculations are standards to pixels I am pretty sure. It couldn't depend on units-that would defeat a major feature of jquery
[14:55:24] <spinningCat> i dont know about that
[14:55:34] <Jasein> I'll prove it to you.
[15:00:46] <spinningCat> okay
[15:01:14] <spinningCat> if i were you i will calculate page width after shrinking it
[15:02:13] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/JVzLRb?editors=1111
[15:05:46] <spinningCat> it seems different to me when i shirk the page
[15:07:11] <spinningCat> i think you can see more clear with window.resize
[15:07:48] <spinningCat> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gyEeWK?editors=1111
[15:08:14] <Jasein> that's because VW is viewport widths.
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> that's gonna give you performance issues btw
[15:08:25] <Jasein> oh thank goodness.
[15:09:03] <Jasein> robertmaxrees, can you help me figure out how to tell when my menu items are touching each other when using flex-box to distribute space between them?
[15:09:05] <spinningCat> robertmaxrees is expert
[15:09:12] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/OGrwxe?editors=1111
[15:09:15] <robertmaxrees> using flexbox?  head over to #css/
[15:09:23] <robertmaxrees> * #css
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> much more likely to get good help over there :)
[15:10:06] <Jasein> How will they be able to tell me how to calculate space between items? Isn't that a javascript or jquery thing?
[15:10:10] <spinningCat> Jasein,  i can suggest viewport units for font
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> Jasein you're using flexbox.  that's CSS.
[15:10:35] <spinningCat> so font will be smaller or bigger according to viewport size
[15:10:35] <robertmaxrees> don't use JS to handle layout issues.
[15:10:44] <Jasein> really?
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:10:48] <Jasein> Thanks.
[15:10:56] <robertmaxrees> use CSS.  js will give you big perf p-
[15:10:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:12:35] <diverdude> hi. why are the .probe divs not being shown here? https://jsfiddle.net/79o8f5px/2/
[15:12:42] <spinningCat> what does perf mean?
[15:12:52] <spinningCat> like hadhache
[15:12:53] <spinningCat> ?
[15:13:02] <robertmaxrees> spinningCat performance
[15:13:26] <robertmaxrees> diverdude https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w0ehr2zy/ ?
[15:14:32] <spinningCat> i see
[15:14:39] <robertmaxrees> diverdude you have css issues.
[15:14:43] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: yeah but when i take it outside the bootstrap div it looks like this: https://jsfiddle.net/16rhcxu8/ which is what i also expected to see inside the bootstrap div
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> right - you have a styling issue, not a js issue :)
[15:15:01] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: what sort of issues ?
[15:15:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w0ehr2zy/3/
[15:15:42] <destramic> ive taken tooltip hide and show from bootstrap....but for some reason my css wont work with the tooltip   https://jsfiddle.net/ehtku5cg/1/    anyone please?
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> basically, your css is off.  i'd hit up #css for more :)
[15:16:05] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: but why is it working outside the bootstrap container?
[15:16:14] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: and not inside
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> diverdude because you have css issues.  hit up #css for more :)
[15:16:49] <robertmaxrees> destramic so what about your css "won't work"?
[15:17:15] <robertmaxrees> destramic also, are you trying to use bootstrap's tooltips or jquery ui's?
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> i ask because mixing bootstrap and jquery ui is generally a bad idea.
[15:34:21] <destramic> robertmaxrees: bootstrap tooltip...as i wanrt to show and hide the tooltip...but i can't style it
[15:34:38] <robertmaxrees> so like
[15:34:47] <robertmaxrees> why use jquery ui and bootstrap side-by-side tho?
[15:36:42] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9vu7nbyr/1/
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ you're basically mixing and matching two frontend libraries that are stomping all over each other.
[15:43:26] <destramic> robertmaxrees: yes like that but i want to hide and show also
[15:43:28] <destramic> manually
[15:43:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:44:00] <robertmaxrees> then read up in the jquery ui docs on how to do it :)
[15:45:17] <destramic> robertmaxrees: thats what the bootstrap as for...but when i use it, i cant apply css to my tooltip
[15:45:24] <robertmaxrees> again
[15:45:30] <robertmaxrees> because you're mixing bootstrap and jquery ui.
[15:45:33] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause you problems.
[15:45:47] <robertmaxrees> you realize that there's no bootstrap added to that fiddle, right?
[15:45:55] <robertmaxrees> you added a bootstrap plugin without the rest of the library
[15:56:59] <destramic> robertmaxrees: i understand that, i just took the tooltip hide and show code and used that...https://jsfiddle.net/wx291ko8/   without ui and bootstap added it still doesnt work =/
[15:57:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't have bootstrap in that fiddle still.
[15:57:50] <robertmaxrees> ah - nvm.  ytou added it.
[15:58:05] <robertmaxrees> you'
[15:58:10] <robertmaxrees> *you're missing popper though - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> or you need to use the bootstrap bundle
[16:00:28] <Betal> robertmaxrees: got some things working, but can you helpme there? https://pastebin.com/hiHAM4MQ
[16:00:43] <Betal> this waitTeams gonna run a lot of times, right?
[16:01:00] <Betal> probably ill need to make the while another function and call it inside the waitTeams function
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:01:23] <robertmaxrees> do idea what you'
[16:01:30] <robertmaxrees> *you're trying to achieve Betal
[16:01:43] <Betal> the idea there is to force load a button
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> also missing functions in here.
[16:01:46] <Betal> and wait it load
[16:01:55] <robertmaxrees> "force load a button" meaning...?
[16:02:04] <Betal> exactly this, lol
[16:02:08] <Betal> it will click the button
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean you're trying to open a modal automatically?
[16:02:31] <Betal> in the SD_clickmodal yes
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> a few things:
[16:02:44] <Betal> but before I need to click this button that load the links that open the modals
[16:02:56] <Betal> (only me going to run this script, thats why)
[16:03:19] <Betal> I know is not so cool to click things for the user
[16:03:30] <Betal> but iam trying to automate for me this thing
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> 1: don't proxy logic through the DOM.  call the modal's "show" method or w/e instead.  2: load what links?  you've given me very little info and are being vague about why you think you need to do things this way.  is there ajax involved?
[16:03:47] <robertmaxrees> 3: while loops are gross :P
[16:04:07] <Betal> yes, ajax involved, thats why waiting
[16:04:11] <Betal> the idea is like that
[16:04:15] <robertmaxrees> do you control the ajax call?
[16:04:26] <Betal> no
[16:04:29] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[16:04:37] <Betal> because the domain is not mine
[16:04:47] <robertmaxrees> so this is a browser plugin or something?
[16:04:54] <Betal> like that
[16:04:57] <robertmaxrees> are you using the copy of jqueyr provided on the page?
[16:05:00] <Betal> (atm is a script that i run on console)
[16:05:02] <robertmaxrees> *jquery
[16:05:13] <Betal> yes
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> hook into the ajax events instead then.
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[16:06:34] <robertmaxrees> you could use $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(event, xhr, settings) {}); and check, for instance, settings.url to make sure you're firing on the correct call :)
[16:07:35] <Betal> so you mean I should create a event to execute when the ajax ends insted of wait randonly it ends
[16:07:39] <destramic> robertmaxrees: thank you
[16:07:53] <robertmaxrees> Betal *bind a listener, not "create a event" :)
[16:08:00] <Betal> ehh
[16:08:04] <robertmaxrees> Betal the event will fire whether or not you bind to it.
[16:09:17] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, avoid timeouts.
[16:09:33] <Betal> robertmaxrees: but this function gonna be call on every ajax success?
[16:09:45] <robertmaxrees> so again
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> you check the settings object so that you then only do what you want when it's the correct ajax call.
[16:10:09] <robertmaxrees> this is much, much better than using a timeout.
[16:10:10] <robertmaxrees> i promise.
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> also, you're doing a nested while with a nested settimeout, which is gonna cause you headaches.
[16:11:13] <Betal> it was a bit different, because was running just one time
[16:11:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:11:27] <Betal> the old code
[16:11:34] <Betal> I had without while
[16:11:34] <robertmaxrees> you have a recursive setTimeout within a while loop...
[16:11:40] <Betal> yeah
[16:11:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't want a while loop.
[16:11:49] <robertmaxrees> nor do you want a settimeout.
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> just add a callback using ajaxSuccess and make your life easier.
[16:13:35] <Betal>     $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(event, xhr, settings) {console.log("something");} should print somehting?
[16:13:44] <Betal> on every ajax that sucess?
[16:14:04] <robertmaxrees> if they're using jquery's ajax and you're not supplying your own version of jquery, yeah
[16:14:15] <Betal> I added this on console, but when I press the button, cant see 'something'
[16:14:36] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that you're waiting on aj ajax call then?
[16:14:46] <robertmaxrees> *an
[16:15:10] <Betal> well, the site load things and add on the DOM, so it is not on the page hidden
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:15:37] <robertmaxrees> the page can build markup without ajax.
[16:16:38] <Betal> but it load info, not random stuff. like links/users..
[16:17:04] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab and see if there are actual ajax calls firing :)
[16:17:45] <Betal> there is a POST, cause = xhr
[16:17:59] <robertmaxrees> does that happen when you click a link or on pageload?
[16:18:08] <Betal> the button
[16:18:21] <robertmaxrees> when you click the button?
[16:18:36] <robertmaxrees> if ajaxSuccess isn't firing then it's likely not using jquery's ajax.
[16:20:58] <Betal> well, in this case what we can do
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> Betal then you're stuck with a recursive settimeout call to check for the element's existense.
[16:21:39] <robertmaxrees> *existence
[16:21:54] <Betal> then we need the settimeout ?
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you added a while loop in your example tho.
[16:22:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah, in this case.
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/7136697/923919 just need something like this.
[16:23:19] <Betal> robertmaxrees: I think the site use angularjs, not sure
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: 'kay.
[16:23:34] <robertmaxrees> either way, check out that SO link.
[16:26:05] <Betal> first I need to click the button and wait the things to load
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> for that you'll likely need to dispatch a native click event.
[16:26:42] <Betal> after that I need to see if still buttons to click (the site dont load all in one click)
[16:26:52] <Betal> thats why my bad while
[16:26:54] <robertmaxrees> so there's some pagination in play?
[16:27:02] <Betal> likely
[16:27:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:27:11] <Betal> need to click, click again
[16:27:15] <robertmaxrees> being vague isn't helpful.
[16:27:16] <Betal> is the same button
[16:27:26] <Betal> lets say have 300 itens, it dont load all
[16:27:29] <robertmaxrees> okay - back way up.
[16:27:29] <robertmaxrees> stop
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> start from the beginning - what are you trying to build?
[16:27:57] <Betal> the main idea?
[16:28:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.  start from the beginning.
[16:28:20] <robertmaxrees> this changing recs stuff drives me bonkers lol
[16:28:38] <Betal> find a possible user on this page given some info of them (atm the avatar)
[16:28:56] <robertmaxrees> so a user search?
[16:29:11] <Betal> the idea is like that, a user is in a group, but the site only show the groups, need to click to see the users inside
[16:29:37] <Betal> so first I am trying to show all groups and latter click them
[16:29:45] <Betal> the part of code I sent was about show all groups
[16:29:45] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason they generally hide that info behind a button fwiw.
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> could be an expensive DB query.
[16:30:30] <Betal> there is another page saying the user should be there, but they dont say where
[16:30:42] <Betal> and manually find is really sad
[16:31:18] <robertmaxrees> have you thought about reaching out to whoever maintains/runs this site and ask for this feature?
[16:31:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd hate for you to build this out to only later be blocked or w/e
[16:32:32] <Betal> well, is possible to ask them, but until they really make this....
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:44] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:32:55] <robertmaxrees> well, that s.o. link has the element check on it.
[16:33:08] <robertmaxrees> so that's the beginning :)
[16:33:17] <Betal> yeah
[16:33:29] <robertmaxrees> simulating a click is pretty simple.
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> quick google search for that one.
[16:33:47] <Betal> is the .click(); line
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> is that not working?
[16:36:34] <Betal> ill do a test
[16:39:02] <Betal> iam thinking how ill do the 2 tests, because first we need to click the button and wait the groups to load, and then check again if the button still exists
[16:39:08] <Betal> or actually I can ignore the first part?
[16:39:16] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:39:35] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the page, your logic is something like:
[16:40:32] <robertmaxrees> actually
[16:40:38] <robertmaxrees> how do you know when there's no more to load?
[16:40:47] <Betal> when there is no more button
[16:41:31] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, you need that recursive call - is there a button?  if yes, click it and rerun the function.  if no, start clicking the members links or w/e
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> i gotta go for a bit.  the store is calling my name :)
[16:42:15] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[16:42:23] <Betal> okay
[16:42:28] <Betal> ill try this one
[20:20:31] <jll94> alright so i am trying to use jquery for a todo app list however when i add a new item i cannot add a strikethrough when that item is clicked, been struggling for some reason with this https://jsfiddle.net/gke5fsnv/
[20:23:49] <Ziberius> jll94: you are only applying the click function that toggles strike class on documen ready
[20:24:05] <Ziberius> you need to set it for the new item somehow
[20:27:33] <pavonia> Also use .each() on items
[20:29:25] <Ziberius> jll94: any reason why you iterate? you could also do it like this: https://jsfiddle.net/gke5fsnv/
[20:29:46] <Ziberius> ups sorry not sure if you can see my changes
[20:29:52] <Ziberius> i'll create a new one
[20:32:25] <Ziberius> https://jsfiddle.net/Ziberius/8v64zayj/1/
[20:32:54] <Ziberius> of course you'll have to specify the ul you are targeting in this case with a class or id
[20:37:43] <jll94> Ziberius: was not aware of this but thank you
[20:38:00] <jll94> idk i guess i am used to doing for loops for lists lol
[20:40:40] <Ziberius> jll94: ok no problem
[23:08:00] <ezio> I'm getting $ undefined because I have jquery loading at the bottom of my layout, and I'm trying to run a script from inside a view.  How can I wait until jQuery is loaded?
[23:08:21] <ezio> $(document).ready isn't going to work
[23:08:59] <ezio> I also don't want to put it in the head because of blocking
[23:16:38] <pavonia> ezio: You could add another script after the loading of jQuery which runs the initialization function
[23:17:01] <ezio> hmm.. good call.
[23:17:47] <pavonia> Setting a timeout and polling is another variant
[23:18:03] <ezio> I was doing that until you said that.  Makes more sense.
[23:22:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use timeouts if you're waiting for jquery to load.
[23:22:09] <robertmaxrees> put your code after jquery instead.
[23:29:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're writing modules that have dependencies, then solve that problem in a sane way, instead of recursive setTimeout calls, which will eventually cause you headaches.
