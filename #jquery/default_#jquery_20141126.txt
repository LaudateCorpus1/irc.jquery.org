[00:00:59] <Sherafff> why new formdata doesn't take the <select>?
[00:11:57] <redGod> can someone please point me to where I can learn how to responsively set an attribute. my searching has been futile
[00:13:45] <Cork> redGod: $(selector).attr('attribute', 'value') ?
[00:13:57] <Cork> redGod: have you tried searching api.jquery.com ?
[00:15:59] <redGod> Cork: $(selector).attr('attribute', 'value') is not responsive, thats what I am using now
[00:30:19] <Cork> redGod: "not responsive"??
[00:33:59] <redGod> Cork: the result is static, if the screen size changes the height attribute stays the same
[00:34:20] <Cork> redGod: javascript is functional not declarative
[00:34:39] <Cork> if you want to react when the window is resized you have to listen for the resize event
[00:44:18] <dokma> is this slow? 		$('option', estimate).each(function(i) { $(this).prop('selected', $('#estimateSubform option').eq(i).prop('selected'));	});
[00:44:35] <dokma> I have a feeling that eq(i) does O(n) each time...
[00:44:52] <dokma> or O(n/2)
[00:45:22] <Cork> dokma: what are you trying to do?
[00:45:37] <Cork> select all options that is selected in one at the other?
[00:45:37] <dokma> copy :selected from original to cloned form
[00:45:58] <Cork> dokma: fastest is prob to reset the second select
[00:46:00] <dokma> because .clonse doesn't copy :selected
[00:46:05] <Cork> and then only select :selected
[00:46:09] <Cork> and set those at the second one
[00:46:18] <dokma> ahhh... that makes sense
[00:46:24] <dokma> it is a single select
[00:46:38] <Cork> also you want to cache $('#estimateSubform option')
[00:46:45] <Cork> so you don't do the query on every loop
[00:47:08] <dokma> I want to keep the code lean though
[00:47:16] <dokma> a few cycles lost don't matter too much
[00:47:37] <Cork> doing the selection over and over again in a loop is NOT lean
[00:47:47] <dokma> lean as in less code
[00:48:27] <Cork> var subf=$('#estimateSubform option'); $('option', estimate).each(function(i) { $(this).prop('selected', subf.eq(i).prop('selected')); });
[00:48:32] <Cork> is not more code
[00:48:46] <Cork> if anything it is more readable
[00:49:02] <dokma> thanks
[00:49:25] <Cork> anyway'
[00:50:31] <Cork> dokma: anyway i would reverse that loop structure
[00:50:36] <Cork> then you can optimize the code better
[00:50:44] <dokma> how so?
[00:52:33] <Cork> dokma: estimate.prop('selected', false); $('#estimateSubform option').find('option:selected').each(function(i) { estimate.eq(i).prop('selected', true); });
[00:53:12] <Cork> gah no that won't work
[00:53:18] <dokma> estimate is a form
[00:53:27] <dokma> do you think I can set selected directly on it?
[00:53:43] <Cork> ok i'm running on fumes here
[00:53:47] <Cork> so no
[00:53:52] <dokma> where are you from?
[00:53:59] <dokma> it's 10am here (Croatia=
[00:54:03] <dokma> (Croatia)
[00:54:21] <Cork> i meant fumes as in, you don't share any context so i have to imagine what you are trying to do
[00:54:45] <dokma> ahhh, sorry about that
[00:54:49] <dokma> but I got your point
[00:54:51] <dokma> it makes sense
[00:55:30] <Cork> another solution would be to just bind a change event listener to the first select element
[00:55:38] <Cork> and set the same option in the second list
[00:55:44] <Cork> then you don't have to do the loop at all
[00:55:51] <Cork> but it isn't always what you want

[02:23:17] <mdev> so I have php output 50k combobox items and everytime I need to get which one is currently set I use $('#combo').find('option:selected').val();
[02:23:23] <mdev> only thing is that's incredibly slow

[02:27:14] <shoky> $('#combo').val()  and don't show 50k items :\
[02:27:27] <mdev> will that get the selected

[02:34:27] <PeterPorka> hello all, i have got a problem with equalTo, i googled for that problem over 3 hours all answers fails, here is my code: http://pastebin.com/7s6VamwP , please help
[02:38:35] <PeterPorka> sorry was disconnected
[02:39:51] <theshit123> hello, how can i discover if there is a div inside other div with a specific class? for example: http://pastebin.com/4abn53hR
[02:40:29] <Cork> theshit123: $(this).find('.bar').length > 0
[02:41:09] <Cork> theshit123: also you most likely want $(data).find('.too').each not $.eahc
[02:41:14] <Cork> *each
[02:42:14] <theshit123> what is different?
[02:43:35] <theshit123> ok, i am reading it from documentation
[02:44:05] <Cork> theshit123: mainly that $().each sets the this variable to the current element
[02:44:10] <Cork> while $.each doesn't
[02:44:17] <Cork> and it makes the code more readable
[02:45:15] <PeterPorka> any idea for the equalTo problem?

[03:13:05] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I have a <ul> with 2 <li>s in it and now I need to add more <li>s to it. The first 2 are created in PHP, the others are supposed to be done in JS on the client side. The problem is, that I want to have 2 before the existing <li>s, 10 between the two existing ones and 2 after the existing <li>s. Is there some nice way to do this without switching between .before() and .after()?
[03:17:08] <Cork> Hackwar1: .preopend and .append
[03:17:14] <Cork> *.prepend
[03:17:46] <Cork> but no you would have to call two separate functions
[03:17:51] <Hackwar1> ok
[03:18:07] <Hackwar1> I guess I have an idea...
[03:32:44] <Eels> Not sure whether this is the place to ask, but is there a way to find out which element is causing my page to load so slowly?
[03:37:21] <sacho> use your browser's profiling tools.
[03:37:32] <sacho> what makes you think an "element" is causing your page to load slowly/
[03:42:09] <Eckyecky> anyone experience with croppic.net?
[03:51:53] <sam-lapp> hi, it's possible to print an page without open it ?
[03:55:04] <Eckyecky> page?
[03:55:09] <Eckyecky> maybe a little more specific
[03:55:22] <sam-lapp> for example
[03:55:41] <callumacrae> Are jQuery promises quite slow? For some reason this simple test always takes ~100ms: https://github.com/Lostmyname/monkey/blob/master/test/tests.spec.js#L15-L19
[03:55:53] <sam-lapp> providing the link to window.print()
[03:56:22] <Eckyecky> try this: https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-printPage-plugin
[03:56:25] <sam-lapp> let's say im on http://intranet/page and want to print http://intranet/page2
[03:57:17] <Eckyecky> Can anyone help me solve this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27148450/trying-to-use-croppic-net-and-make-it-a-dropzone-can-anyone-figure-this-out
[04:02:11] <sacho> sam-lapp, no.
[04:02:53] <sam-lapp> sacho: no with window.print() right ?

[05:15:55] <disorder> hello
[05:16:05] <Omar-> hi everyone
[05:17:03] <Omar-> widget factory question: I have made a custom event; once event is dispatched, I wanto remove it (_off) and then re-attached it (_on)
[05:17:14] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/pomeze/edit?js
[05:17:53] <Omar-> the event is dispatched from with _handleScrollStop function
[05:18:06] <Omar-> using _trigger("eventname")
[05:18:07] <Cork> Omar-: why remove and add it back agaon??
[05:18:27] <Omar-> Cork i'm glad you've remove the ignore ;)
[05:18:32] <Omar-> it's a fix for iOS 8
[05:18:40] <Omar-> the event is firing twice
[05:18:43] * Cork nods
[05:18:49] <Omar-> only Safari not Chrome
[05:18:50] <Cork> ya, been there
[05:19:15] <Omar-> http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/infinite-scrolling/
[05:19:30] <Omar-> this is the original code but I have decided to convert it into an event
[05:20:37] <Cork> Omar-: ok, so just run ._off()._on() ?
[05:20:44] <disorder> I have a keypress event (on enter) in my code, and basically I dinamically create new input fields and such, click to create way, and I added a property field to it so I can regulate min and max length and name the inputs, it works on "enter" but only when I create one input by one and give them properties.. but when I create multiple inputs at the same time the enter only gives properties to the last created input.. my code is huge so here is just a part of
[05:20:44] <disorder>  it http://jsfiddle.net/awswss2q/ .. any of you worked with keypress events with a counter?
[05:20:58] <Cork> disorder: don't use keypress -- ever
[05:21:05] <Cork> it is deprecated and not cross browser
[05:21:16] <Cork> use keydown instead
[05:21:17] <Omar-> Cork this.element._off("scrollstop")?
[05:21:39] <disorder> hmm thanks for the first advice
[05:21:43] <Omar-> I want to remove it from element not document
[05:22:02] <Cork> Omar-: this._off(this.document, "scrollstop"
[05:22:40] <Cork> disorder: also not sure what the question is
[05:22:46] <Omar-> because jQM uses scrollstop for other purposes so I dont want to cause any malfunctionality in jQM
[05:22:47] <Omar-> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/5f622de9d3013f348957dd5beb7d206b7bae9e9c/js/widgets/pagecontainer.js#L85-L89
[05:23:09] <Cork> (try to separate the question from the facts, makes life easier for everyone)
[05:23:21] <Cork> Omar-: so use a namespace
[05:23:42] <disorder> how do I give properties to each input field that I create on enter, when I create multiple fields it only gives properties to the last created input
[05:23:43] <Cork> "scrollstop.my-private-namescope"
[05:24:39] <Cork> disorder: what is $itemWrap?
[05:24:39] <Omar-> Cork good idea. how can I define scrollstop.my-own to act like scrollstop native?
[05:24:48] <Cork> Omar-: built in
[05:24:59] <Cork> jquery splits events at dot
[05:25:12] <Cork> and treats the right side as a namespace
[05:25:51] <Omar-> mind my ignorance
[05:25:59] <Cork> Omar-: $(document).on('click.mine', func).trigger('click') // func is triggered
[05:26:22] <Cork> Omar-: $(document).on('click.not-mine', func).trigger('click.mine') // func is NOT triggered
[05:26:22] <Omar-> this._on(this.document, {
[05:26:23] <Omar->                 "scrollstop.myown": "_handleScrollStop"
[05:26:23] <Omar->             });
[05:26:38] <Omar-> will act like the built-in "scrollstop"?
[05:27:02] <Cork> hmm never used a string as the function part
[05:27:10] <Cork> would have to look into what that does
[05:27:34] <Omar-> "_handleScrollStop" is the handler a separate function
[05:27:47] <Omar-> "scrollstop" is native/built-in event
[05:28:04] <Cork> hmm
[05:28:08] <Cork> not part of the documentation :/
[05:28:12] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[05:28:52] <Omar-> it's tricky
[05:29:58] <Omar-> I'll try scrollstop.mine
[05:30:22] <Cork> ah
[05:30:38] <Cork> it delegates the event handler to widget if you don't give it a handler
[05:31:04] <Cork> but... how does it bind the function...
[05:31:08] <Omar-> scrollstop.mine didnt work
[05:31:19] <Omar-> it listens to "scrollstop" event
[05:31:34] <Omar-> whenever scrollstop fires, the handler works
[05:31:41] <Cork> Omar-: yes it is meant to listen for scrollstop events
[05:31:45] <Omar-> when bottom is reached, the event is fired
[05:31:51] <Omar-> yea exactly
[05:32:05] <Omar-> the custom event "bottomreached" is working as expected
[05:32:05] <Cork> namespace doesn't block out unprefixed events
[05:33:22] <Cork> ah, there we go
[05:33:35] <Cork> ( typeof handler === "string" ? instance[ handler ] : handler ).apply( instance, arguments )
[05:33:46] <Cork> that is how the string version works
[05:36:01] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I got a jQuery(window).width() in my script which is executed on .ready(). This reports 980px on my mobile and I already put the viewport meta tag into the header. I need to get the correct width, in order to have my mobile code working...
[05:36:12] <Hackwar1> a millisecond later, it works correctly.
[05:36:41] <Cork> Hackwar1: don't expect rendering to wait for js on mobiles
[05:36:44] <Cork> they won't
[05:37:31] <Cork> they are doing some quite grouse hacks on mobiles to get things perform semi ok
[05:37:55] <Hackwar1> the question is, how I can get the real resolution
[05:37:56] <Cork> Hackwar1: if you need to do things before rendering use @media in css
[05:38:06] <Cork> Hackwar1: wait for .load
[05:38:22] <Hackwar1> isn't .ready() later in time than .load()?
[05:38:22] <Eckyecky> can anyone figure this out? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27148450/trying-to-use-croppic-net-and-make-it-a-dropzone-can-anyone-figure-this-out
[05:38:29] <Cork> no, far from it
[05:38:35] <Hackwar1> ok
[05:38:38] <Cork> Hackwar1: read stands for dom ready
[05:38:47] <Cork> or the underlying DOMContentLoaded
[05:39:03] <Cork> it means just that "the initial html has been parsed and the dom is stable"
[05:39:12] <Cork> no third party content has been loaded
[05:39:16] <Cork> except blocking js
[05:39:20] <Hackwar1> ok
[05:39:31] <Erwat> mobile is annoying
[05:39:37] <Cork> .load is when all external resources has been loaded
[05:39:54] <Cork> not including js triggered ajax calls
[05:41:21] <Cork> Erwat: and yes mobile can be quite challenging
[05:41:34] <Cork> especially with older ios/android versions
[05:41:46] <Cork> as there browsers are R-E-A-L-Y crappy
[05:42:20] <Omar-> Cork hmmm I'm trying to understand that line :/
[05:42:36] <Cork> Omar-: it just checks if the handler is a string
[05:42:44] <Cork> if it is uses it as a key on the windows instance
[05:42:50] <Cork> else uses it as a function
[05:43:12] <Cork> and then applies the arguments on the function if finds through this
[05:43:38] <Hackwar1> Cork: sorry, but the "load" hint was BS.
[05:43:52] <Hackwar1> now my code is run even before the DOM is ready and that doesn't help me at all.
[05:44:13] <Omar-> Cork thanks a lot, I'm going to drive you crazy for sure because I dont understand any of this stuff lol. I'm not a programmer, just a hobbyist
[05:44:27] <Omar-> I'll try to play around with code
[05:44:28] <Cork> Hackwar1: uh that isn't possible
[05:45:35] <Hackwar1> at least its not correct when applying it to document
[05:46:50] <Omar-> Hackwar1 have you tried window.innerWidth?
[05:47:09] <Omar-> JS native
[05:47:26] <Omar-> or jQuery way $(window)[0].innerWidth
[06:29:58] <decx> what
[06:36:58] <emx> is $('[name="ElementNameHere"]') as performant as getElementsByName( 'ElementNameHere' )?
[06:39:47] <xec> emx: of course not, but depending on how many times you run the selector, it's not very likely to be a noticable difference
[06:40:04] <emx> xec, k, thanks
[06:40:18] <emx> (it's just that the code is anything but readable)
[06:41:23] <xec> as long as the reader knows about jquery and css attribute selectors it reads fine
[06:41:26] <Cork> i'm actually not sure that is true in todays browsers
[06:41:41] <Cork> they cross bread between the old an modern functions quite a bit
[06:42:05] <Seich> emx: No
[06:43:08] <emx> xec, maintainability is also about readability, independent of how much the reader knows.
[06:43:33] <emx> also complicated code (or selectors) drain the brain more than readable code (or selectors)
[06:44:09] <Cork> emx: i think the use of [name=""] is more commonly use hen getElementByName
[06:44:28] <Cork> as it is the same syntax you find in css files
[06:44:30] <xec> personally i read "getElementsByName" as "getElementByTagName" and had to re-read three times until i realized
[06:44:39] <Cork> ya, same here
[06:44:57] <emx> you two write to complicated code :P
[06:45:04] <emx> *too
[06:45:49] <Cork> emx: i don't think document.querySelector('[name="something"]') is more complicated then document.getElementByName('something')
[06:46:40] <Cork> and the former can be given a selector that expresses what it is much better then getElementByName ever can
[06:46:50] <emx> Cork, i disagree. the latter one is more readable to me. simply because it has easily interpretable characters
[06:46:55] <xec> i agree with Cork on this one, and we never agree on anything ;D
[06:47:02] <Cork> lol
[06:47:19] <Cork> xec: i have to disagree with you there :D
[06:47:23] <xec> lol
[06:47:25] <emx> but this is about maintainability and taste. we could discuss for ages.
[06:48:32] <xec> i'm sure you'll get quite the biased answer asking in #jquery though, you could try another forum
[06:48:35] <Cork> emx: about performance i would suggest looking into a jspref test for that
[06:49:01] <Cork> cause i seriously not sure modern browsers optimize getElementByName more then you get with that querySelector line
[06:49:28] <cjohnson> !microoptimizing
[06:49:33] <Cork> true
[06:49:41] <cjohnson> ;)
[06:49:56] <emx> Cork, it was more like a spontaneous question. i will look into it as soon as i generate a rainbowtablel for AES.
[06:50:05] <cjohnson> if you're bored, profile your code and find out what's actually taking up time instead of jquery vs querySelector
[06:50:22] <Cork> emx: take that time and put it into caching a query somewhere
[06:50:40] <Cork> that will have much bigger inpact on performance then this will ever have
[07:04:12] <pdcmoreira> guys, i have a bunch of <input ... name="time[0][start]"> where 0 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5... i'm trying to select them all like $('input[name="time[*][start]"]'), how can i do that?
[07:04:56] <decx> add a class
[07:06:00] <pdcmoreira> nvm
[07:06:26] <pdcmoreira> $('input[name^="time"]') works like a charm
[07:06:54] <cjohnson> nerp
[07:06:57] <paulvd> is there a way to check if a selection dropdown value has been selected?
[07:06:58] <cjohnson> time[0][end]
[07:07:08] <cjohnson> your selector will also pick up end
[07:07:15] <paulvd> select*
[07:07:15] <cjohnson> the correct answer is a class
[07:07:19] <paulvd> which has a valid value
[07:07:29] <decx> attribute selectors gets very slow when you have a bunch of inputs
[07:07:29] <cjohnson> check the $select.val() paulvd
[07:07:32] <pdcmoreira> cjohnson: yeah but i also want to do stuff with end
[07:07:50] <cjohnson> pdcmoreira: right but the point is you can't differentiate
[07:09:00] <garethdaine> Guys, Iâ€™m using Bootstrap 3â€™s modal event hooks and Iâ€™m trying to hook in to the â€˜hidden.bd.modalâ€™ event as described here, but itâ€™s not working. Hereâ€™s my code, http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/13GR, any ideas?
[07:09:07] <garethdaine> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-usage
[07:09:11] <paulvd> if(jQuery('.ginput_container select').val()){ this will work ?
[07:09:41] <paulvd> coz it doesnt work
[07:09:42] <cjohnson> that will check if that select's value is truthy, aka everything except value=0 or value=""
[07:09:56] <paulvd> hm
[07:10:46] <garethdaine> Odd, you have to use $(document) instead of the id of your modal like it describes in the bootstrap docs
[07:12:08] <pdcmoreira> cjohnson: $('input[name*="time"][name*="start"]') picks starts only
[07:12:28] <pdcmoreira> or $('input[name^="time"][name*="start"]')
[07:12:37] <paulvd> well that doesnt work
[07:13:20] <cjohnson> pdcmoreira: or you could just correctly add a class instead of making a messy selector that's still prone to bugs and false positives
[07:13:27] <cjohnson> paulvd: sure it does
[07:14:00] <pdcmoreira> cjohnson: that looks messy to you?
[07:14:13] <cjohnson> pdcmoreira: name="timestart" will match that. or name="start[0][time]".
[07:14:22] <cjohnson> yes, it's not very specific
[07:14:25] <cjohnson> and it's slow
[07:14:42] <pdcmoreira> :(
[07:14:49] <pdcmoreira> i was proud of that selector a minute ago
[07:14:52] <cjohnson> you're trying to make a selector that guesses at what you want instead of just using a class and being sure it's getting exactly what you want
[07:15:03] <cjohnson> it makes assumptions, assumptions lead to bugs
[07:15:41] <pdcmoreira> can i use something else than a class
[07:15:44] <pdcmoreira> like data-
[07:15:55] <pdcmoreira> or it's better to just use a class
[07:16:12] <cjohnson> sure. a class is slightly faster, but as long as you're doing something explicit I think it's fine
[07:17:19] <pdcmoreira> data-time="start"
[07:17:24] <pdcmoreira> data-time="end"
[07:17:50] <pdcmoreira> i don't like to miss classes, because i see classes as something generic-ish
[07:18:16] <pdcmoreira> i mean, a class can be used in any part of the ap
[07:18:17] <pdcmoreira> app
[07:18:53] <pdcmoreira> and i dont want to be looking at my custom.css for a .timestart class
[07:19:04] <pdcmoreira> just to remember that it was just for jquery
[07:19:11] <cjohnson> yeah I feel ya
[07:19:25] <pdcmoreira> with data- i can instantly see that i'm using that for code
[07:19:36] <cjohnson> I have been using data attributes more lately
[07:21:21] <pdcmoreira> as long as you are careful with the weird behaviour of jquery when setting x.data() or x.prop() or x.attr()
[07:21:43] <pdcmoreira> setting-getting
[07:22:01] <pdcmoreira> some change the DOM, some don't
[07:23:03] <pdcmoreira> for example, x.data() doesn't change the DOM, so if you write with x.data(...) and then read x.data() it outputs the original data in the DOM
[07:23:15] <paulvd> if(jQuery('.ginput_container select').val()){ ??
[07:23:29] <pdcmoreira> so you must do x.attr() to set the data, then read it with x.data()
[07:24:05] <cjohnson> .data is the only one that doesn't interact with the DOM, and intentionally so
[07:24:31] <paulvd> that doesnt work?
[07:24:42] <cjohnson> it's just confusing that the DOM is read into the data attributes on first read
[07:24:46] <cjohnson> yes it does paulvd
[07:24:59] <cjohnson> unless "doesnt work" means something else
[07:25:04] <cjohnson> ie your selector is wrong

[07:38:54] <reynierpm> hi and moorning, can I get some help on this SO topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27152972/bootstrap-3-modal-is-closed-when-enter-is-pressed-but-form-is-not-submitted-and
[07:40:28] <emx> what could be the reason for when iterating an object with $.each i get 0 as first key instead of the.. first key.
[07:42:59] <cjohnson> 0 is the first key then
[07:43:06] <cjohnson> log the variable
[07:43:19] <emx> cjohnson, i did. it's an object.
[07:43:28] <cjohnson> that doesn't mean it doesn't have numeric keys
[07:43:29] <emx> i paste the code, hang on
[07:43:33] <cjohnson> { 0: 'a' } is an object
[07:43:36] <cjohnson> with 0 as the first key
[07:45:27] <emx> cjohnson, http://pastie.org/9744927
[07:46:13] <cjohnson> it's $.each(validationRules, func...
[07:46:24] <cjohnson> $(something).each is for iterating over jquery collections
[07:47:13] <emx> i will never learn it. sorry for bothering :P
[07:47:14] <emx> thanks
[07:47:15] <cjohnson> and the callback params might differ, I can't recall. check the docs
[07:47:18] <cjohnson> no problem
[08:11:27] <pdcmoreira> guys, can i do var indexFound = $.each(arr, function(i, v) { if(something) return i; }) ?
[08:12:57] <BillCriswell> pdcmoreira: Are you trying to save the index to just get an element in that index?
[08:13:16] <pdcmoreira> no
[08:13:34] <pdcmoreira> i'm trying to save the index of the found item
[08:13:46] <pdcmoreira> (found means that "something" is true)
[08:14:01] <pdcmoreira> but i made it work
[08:14:12] <pdcmoreira> im doing var index = -1; before the loop
[08:14:22] <pdcmoreira> then when i find it, i set index = i;
[08:14:35] <BillCriswell> Using each there is overkill.
[08:15:06] <BillCriswell> That's why I was a bit confused haha.
[08:15:18] <BillCriswell> Wanted to make sure filter() wouldn't more suit your needs.
[08:15:27] <pdcmoreira> the thing is, i have the array with the jQuery objects
[08:15:55] <pdcmoreira> and then, in an event, i can get the object's name attribute with e.target.name
[08:16:23] <pdcmoreira> so i now need the index in the array in which the object has that name
[08:16:41] <BillCriswell> so arr is a jquery object?
[08:17:00] <pdcmoreira> arr is an array of jQuery objects
[08:17:18] <cjohnson> it's a jquery collection? or it's an array of jquery collections
[08:17:38] <pdcmoreira> its a jquery collection oO i guess
[08:17:56] <pdcmoreira> var arr = $('input[data-time=start]');
[08:18:00] <pdcmoreira> thats it
[08:18:05] <pdcmoreira> it gets some inputs
[08:18:18] <BillCriswell> And you want an element from that array?
[08:18:28] <pdcmoreira> no, i just want the index
[08:18:32] <cjohnson> for what purpose though
[08:19:12] <pdcmoreira> so i can go to the same position in the corresponding "ends" array
[08:19:22] <pdcmoreira> and get the previous object of that index
[08:19:52] <cjohnson> hrm, I wouldn't assume the order will be the same
[08:20:04] <pdcmoreira> so i have the 3rd start and i want to go to the 2nd end
[08:20:15] <BillCriswell> Let's say you have: var arr = $('input[data-time=start]'); You can do like... var oneYouWant = arr.filter(function () { return this.name === e.target.name }); then you can do like.. arr.eq(oneYouWant - 1);
[08:20:34] <BillCriswell> arr.eq(arr.index(oneYouWant) - 1); *
[08:21:01] <pdcmoreira> cjohnson: why wouldnt it be the same?
[08:21:18] <cjohnson> since your names are time[0][start] what I would do is read all the elements, both start and end, and then sort them all into an array using the index
[08:21:24] <cjohnson> that way they're explicitly paired
[08:23:06] <cjohnson> depending what you're trying to do here. if you just need to look them up one at a time, I would find the start elemenet and then use its name to find the end one
[08:24:10] <pdcmoreira> but if they're on the html in order
[08:24:11] <cjohnson> maybe I'm wrong but I don't think the order of a DOM query is guaranteed to be the order they appear in the DOM. generally it appears to work that way
[08:24:19] <pdcmoreira> can they not be in order in jquery?
[08:24:20] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... .index() says it should take a selector.
[08:24:36] <BillCriswell> pdcmoreira: I never experienced anything other than dom order.
[08:25:00] <BillCriswell> Ah, I was doing it wrong.
[08:25:10] <cjohnson> I haven't either but if it's not explicitly true I wouldn't necessarily rely on it. another consideration is what if one of the ends is missing
[08:25:13] <cjohnson> it would throw off the order
[08:25:19] <BillCriswell> pdcmoreira: var index = arr.index($('[name=foo]')); can work
[08:25:50] <pdcmoreira> hm
[08:26:10] <huma> is there a jquery way to update $foo after $foo.replaceWith(bar)?
[08:26:14] <BillCriswell> pdcmoreira: Even better, var index = arr.index(e.target);
[08:26:49] <BillCriswell> Maybe needs $(e.target)...
[08:27:06] <BillCriswell> Not, just the el works so e.target is good.
[08:27:29] <pdcmoreira> yeah!
[08:27:32] <pdcmoreira> awesome
[08:27:45] <pdcmoreira> var index = starts.index(e.target);
[08:27:48] <BillCriswell> The docs say it takes a selector. I wonder if that's a bug.
[08:29:13] <shoky> it can take a selector
[08:30:25] <BillCriswell> shoky: I'll try isolating it and proving myself wrong.
[08:30:53] <shoky> If a selector string is passed as an argument, .index() returns an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to the elements matched by the selector.
[08:31:29] <hackal> Hello please could you help me? I am looking for every 'a>img' on page. And I need to add attribute to <a> tag but I dont know how to target it since jQuery(this) targets to image and not the link. Here is example http://jsfiddle.net/k7ego2m8/ Thanks
[08:31:31] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah I tried that.
[08:32:16] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/index/ in the consloe I'm running $('li').index($('.dropdown')) and getting 6, $('li').index('.dropdown') returns -1
[08:33:49] <shoky> BillCriswell: because the first <li> is not a .dropdown
[08:34:23] <shoky> $('li').index('.dropdown')  is same as $('li').first().index('.dropdown')
[08:34:41] <BillCriswell> That seems weird?
[08:34:43] <shoky> which looks for the first <li> inside $('.dropdown')  (so to speak)
[08:35:03] <shoky> it's not meant to be used on a collection such as $('li')
[08:35:29] <shoky> rather  someDropdown.index('li')  to see out of the <li>'s, what's the index of someDropdown
[08:35:55] <doug64k> hackal: http://jsfiddle.net/k7ego2m8/1/
[08:36:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: Gotcha.
[08:36:19] <doug64k> BillCriswell: think of it like Array#indexOf
[08:36:56] <BillCriswell> I understand it now. It feels weird to me though.
[08:37:06] <doug64k> it does feel weird
[08:37:28] <shoky> it's weird
[08:38:56] <mitzev_> how can i spli a table row like: <tr><td>one</td><td>two</td><td>three</td> into <tr><td>one</td></tr><tr><td>two</td></tr><tr><td>three</td></tr> using jquery?
[08:39:07] <mitzev_> split/transform*
[08:39:13] <bbclover> Hey guys, using this plugin: https://github.com/dbushell/Nestable/blob/master/jquery.nestable.js you can do things like $('dd').nestable('expandAll'); where expandAll is a function in this plugin. What handles that? why is .nestable('someFunction') a thing?
[08:39:14] <hackal> doug64k: thanks
[08:39:57] <mitzev_> (i have 3 cells per row, and want to instead use jquery to turn it into 1 cell per row)
[08:40:13] <skullcrasher> if I have an event handler on('submit'...) and want to attach a form field to the sent form, do I have to do an e.preventDefault() or does it work if I just attach the field in the handler function?
[08:40:47] <hackal> doug64k: I see you also changed selector, will your example add the attribute to all 'a>img' ?
[08:41:25] <doug64k> hackal: $('a').find('b>c') is the same thing as $('a b>c')
[08:41:45] <hackal> ok thank you vm
[08:45:11] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: Trying to think of a clever way to do this instead of a way.
[08:45:35] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, k
[08:45:41] <G3ntoo> if I have a function inside of a for loop, is it possible to pass the number through? https://dl2.volafile.io/get/D9sTP5F0VEWyL/help.txt
[08:48:07] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: $('td').unwrap().wrap(function () { return '<tr></tr>'; });
[08:48:24] <cjohnson> bbclover: it binds $.fn.nestable which then calls their plugin code
[08:48:47] <bbclover> is $.fn.nestable something special
[08:48:52] <BillCriswell> Er actually $('td').unwrap().wrap('<tr></tr>'); mitzev_
[08:48:59] <cjohnson> $.fn is the prototype that collections extend from
[08:49:09] <mitzev_> trying
[08:49:09] <cjohnson> so $.fn.blah = 'a';  $('a').blah // a
[08:49:16] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zasepacopi/2/edit
[08:49:31] <bbclover> cjohnson: do you have some good reference for that?
[08:49:35] <bbclover> It's a very important thing huh?
[08:49:37] <mitzev_> checking
[08:49:45] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.fn.extend/
[08:49:55] <cjohnson> its how you extend jquery collections yep
[08:50:06] <cjohnson> most plugins use it
[08:50:38] <BillCriswell> I'm shocked $('td').unwrap().wrap('<tr></tr>'); works.
[08:50:59] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, works, thank ya
[08:51:04] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:51:11] <bbclover> thanks
[08:51:25] <mitzev_> do you think i should target each table on the page?
[08:51:52] <mitzev_> instead of doing $('td') ?
[08:52:21] <mitzev_> i dont really need to, because the all tables on the page need to be transformed anyway, just curious
[08:52:25] <jsys> Folks, React.JS vs. jQuery, what is the community's mood about those two? I like React.JS, I think it has some nice ideas, but I really prefer jQuery's "swiss army knife" approach to practical app writing
[08:52:30] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: Yes.
[08:52:35] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: Should always be specific.
[08:52:41] <mitzev_> :(
[08:52:44] <robertmaxrees> jsys two different tools.
[08:52:52] <BillCriswell> If all the tables need it I might not mitzev_.
[08:52:58] <cjohnson> they do different things, it's up to your application
[08:53:01] <robertmaxrees> one is a dom abstraction library, the other is an FRP library
[08:53:05] <jsys> robertmaxrees, sure but mostly solving the same problem - DOM interop
[08:53:08] <BillCriswell> but it could bite you in the ass when you add a table you don't wan tot do that to later.
[08:53:14] <robertmaxrees> jsys i'd disagree with that assessment.
[08:53:16] <cjohnson> if I were starting a project from scratch I would probably try to engineer it to avoid jquery
[08:53:16] <mitzev_> :), okay, true
[08:53:23] <cjohnson> but jquery is very useful for a lot of things
[08:53:33] <jsys> Yeah but why would you avoid jQuery
[08:53:36] <mitzev_> ok then, so after i have transformed, how would i get it back to original 3 cells per row?
[08:53:41] <robertmaxrees> because it's not always necessary to use.
[08:53:46] <jsys> Maybe jQuery isn't the problem, but the fact it "allows" poor code if you use it poorly
[08:53:49] <mitzev_> basically like a toggle thing
[08:53:59] <cjohnson> to me jquery is a glue between two mismatched interfaces
[08:54:01] <robertmaxrees> jsys react allows "poor" code, as well.
[08:54:20] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: I'd actually do that with CSS if it needed to toggle.
[08:54:26] <robertmaxrees> any library/framework does.  apples to oranges comparison imo.
[08:54:30] <cjohnson> I'd rather use one consistent interface. it's teh same reason I'd start a new server side project in JS instead of PHP as well
[08:54:39] <cjohnson> consistency front to back
[08:54:53] <jsys> robertmaxrees, sure, but I mean jQuery could be seen as being ambivalent towards spaghetti controllerviewmodels, while React.JS is clearly the view part, with a specific opinion about how data flows into it
[08:54:55] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, how would you do that?
[08:55:04] <mitzev_> i thought i needed js to do it
[08:55:17] <robertmaxrees> jsys right, because they do completely different things :)
[08:55:27] <robertmaxrees> they could even complement each other if you wanted them to.
[08:55:39] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: http://jsbin.com/zasepacopi/2/edit?css
[08:55:42] <mitzev_> you mean use js to apply styles?
[08:55:46] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: You'd still need JS, just less of it.
[08:55:48] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[08:56:26] <BillCriswell> I'd check that in a few browsers to make sure nested display: table-row;'s don't cause issues.
[08:57:05] <BillCriswell> Ah it starts to creep across the page lol
[08:57:14] <BillCriswell> Hmm...
[08:57:54] <mitzev_> hmm
[09:00:02] <BillCriswell> Doesn't do that in firefox.
[09:02:19] <BillCriswell> Rewrapping with Javascript would be annoying.
[09:02:39] <hackal> is there a way to select elements which is located after 'a > img'? http://jsfiddle.net/k7ego2m8/2/
[09:03:14] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: http://jsbin.com/zasepacopi/3/edit?css,js,output there we go.
[09:03:19] <BillCriswell> Better behaved.
[09:04:09] <cjohnson> next, hackal
[09:04:39] <BillCriswell> hackal: You would need to use .parent().next() though.
[09:04:48] <cjohnson> hrm, that might just be "next element in the jquery collection"
[09:04:57] <robertmaxrees> and use .data() for data attributes ;)
[09:05:44] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, ccant see any diff?
[09:05:52] <mitzev_> in the code
[09:06:08] <BillCriswell> The css is different.
[09:06:31] <mitzev_> lol sure?
[09:06:40] <doug64k> mitzev_: literal interpretation http://jsfiddle.net/1414jwb6/
[09:06:41] <BillCriswell> Instead of table.flat td { display: table-row; }  I do  table.flat, table.flat tr, table.flat td { display: block; }
[09:06:42] <mitzev_> :/
[09:07:10] <mitzev_> ok, i cant see the new css for some reaso
[09:07:22] <mitzev_> doug64k, checking
[09:07:26] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: http://jsbin.com/zasepacopi/3/edit?css,js,output
[09:07:35] <BillCriswell> vs http://jsbin.com/zasepacopi/2/edit?css,js,output
[09:07:55] <BillCriswell> You click toggle view a lot with /2/ it'll do some weird thigns with the table in Chrome.
[09:08:27] <mitzev_> ok i see it now
[09:09:05] <BillCriswell> doug64k: I coult not think of the word lineraize lol
[09:09:10] <BillCriswell> I went with "flat"
[09:09:14] <doug64k> :)
[09:09:28] <mitzev_> toodalize xD
[09:09:39] <hackal> robertmaxrees: how exactly does the .data() works? I just need to add attributes <a href="#" data-lightbox="image" data-title="title"></a>
[09:09:53] <mitzev_> 2dalization!
[09:10:00] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Also, $('td').unwrap().wrap('<tr></tr>'); worked with that, but I'm not sure how it didn't unwrap itself out of the table.
[09:10:02] <cjohnson> hackal: it stores it outside the DOM
[09:10:10] <cjohnson> but it reads from the data attributes for the first read
[09:10:34] <cjohnson> as long as you read it using .data and not .attr/.prop writing with .data is the right way
[09:10:37] <robertmaxrees> hackal .data() accesses/edits a cached version of the element's data.
[09:10:50] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for more.
[09:10:58] <robertmaxrees> but its generally what you really want.
[09:11:09] <doug64k> I'm not going for maximum cleverness though - my code runs reasonably fast and you can see what it does pretty obviously
[09:12:04] <hackal> robertmaxrees: I have lightbox library http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ I would use .data() only if this library reads it from .data() right?
[09:12:51] <doug64k> hackal: .data is for everyone to use
[09:12:54] <robertmaxrees> hackal are you trying to create the anchors/images using javascript?
[09:15:11] <doug64k> BillCriswell: yeah that is weird that it kept it in the dom
[09:15:12] <hackal> no I am adding lightbox to all my images in wordpress page. Images are already on page. But without lightbox attributes
[09:15:54] <robertmaxrees> hackal why not add them via the backend?>
[09:16:56] <hackal> I am not very familiar with php
[09:17:20] <doug64k> BillCriswell: yeah flatten is a good term - flattening usually means concatenating several arrays so in this analogy each row is one input array
[09:17:28] <robertmaxrees> lol you should learn and do it there anyway.  i'd avoid doing things like that with js.
[09:18:11] <hackal> robertmaxrees: so adding elements, attributes to dom with js is not good idea?
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> not when you can reasonably avoid it.
[09:18:46] <Eckyecky> can anyone help me solve this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27148450/trying-to-use-croppic-net-and-make-it-a-dropzone-can-anyone-figure-this-out ?

[09:58:25] <robertmaxrees> try http://fixee.org/paste/2rpdonb/
[09:58:35] <robertmaxrees> look at your console - that might tell you a little more.
[09:58:46] <unseensoul> Hi
[09:59:13] <robertmaxrees> Bogdaniel you could always check your network panel, as well, and make sure the request is succeeding.
[09:59:20] <robertmaxrees> also make sure your JSON is valid.
[10:01:02] <Bogdaniel> robertmaxrees yeap I was forgetting to encode in php I was returning a php array
[10:01:08] <robertmaxrees> there you go.

[10:01:49] <Jisan> I want to make a vertical scrolling timeline
[10:01:59] <Jisan> is there any plugin for this?
[10:02:20] <robertmaxrees> "vertical scrolling timeline" is pretty ambiguous.
[10:26:48] <stephen> Hola
[10:27:45] <robertmaxrees> helllo
[10:28:23] <Rlphlrn> stephen : do you speak english?
[10:28:53] <stephen> Yeah
[10:29:02] <stephen> Just a Texan greeting the crowd
[10:29:23] <robertmaxrees> and california
[10:29:28] <robertmaxrees> and lots of other places hahaha
[10:29:37] <Rlphlrn> ahhh
[10:36:51] <rubyonrailed> Hey, I'm redirecting a page via Javascript, and I want to use a .trigger('click') on an element after the page is redirected.  I have this currently https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b0ab1f64be0cf2f8bb3e  But I think the trigger is happening before the page is loaded.
[10:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to put the trigger code on the new page.
[10:52:07] <disgrntld> hello! I'm trying to learn promises, why isn't http://jsfiddle.net/33vc58xe/ printing 'third'?
[10:54:28] <cjohnson> .done() doesn't return the value of the callback inside synchronously
[10:55:01] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: That makes it difficult.  That page is accessed as the root_url, and I only want the jquery to load sometimes.
[10:55:22] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed you can't run the code on a page it's not included on.
[10:55:33] <robertmaxrees> once the new page loads, the click event code has disappeared.
[10:56:08] <disgrntld> cjohnson, then how do I sequence two promises so that I can attach a success callback to the second?
[10:57:08] <cjohnson> I think attach the .done inside the first .done, I'm not super familiar with jquery's deferreds
[10:57:22] <cjohnson> but there's a better way to sequence them let me look
[10:57:40] <disgrntld> thanks, I appreciate it
[10:58:26] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[10:59:03] <cjohnson> no wait this is for running them in parallel
[10:59:08] <cjohnson> like Promise.all
[11:00:24] <disgrntld> yea, I'm trying to do 3 async requests, the first two in parallel with $.when, and the third sequenced after them
[11:00:42] <cjohnson> oh well then that's what you want
[11:01:27] <cjohnson> $.when will let you say "when all these promises are fulfilled, resolve the new promise"
[11:01:37] <cjohnson> the third code block shows how to do that
[11:03:58] <disgrntld> that part works great, I can get the resolved values of the first two async requests and start the third, it's just any more done()s I attach still have the resolved values from before
[11:04:48] <disgrntld> meh, I'm gonna go eat lunch and mull this over, thanks for the help though, cjohnson
[11:07:59] <cjohnson> because you're referencing the outer promise
[11:08:07] <dp> can I chain something like $('#the-id').toggleClass('active').post() ?
[11:08:39] <cjohnson> disgrntld: .done(foo).done(foo).done(foo) will call foo with the args from the same promise each time
[11:08:49] <cjohnson> you need to attach your second done to the inner promise
[11:09:27] <robertmaxrees> dp sure.
[11:11:15] <dp> robertmaxrees: hrm. when I do that, I get "undefined is not a function"
[11:13:14] <robertmaxrees> dp on which part?
[11:13:53] <dp> from what I gather, the .post() part.
[11:14:10] <dp> $('#save-button').toggleClass('active').post(); triggers it
[11:14:26] <robertmaxrees> err, because there's no .post() method iirc.
[11:14:33] <dp> there's a $.post
[11:14:45] <robertmaxrees> right, not the same as what you're doing.
[11:14:46] <cjohnson> that's for making AJAX POST requests
[11:14:50] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to trigger a form post?
[11:15:02] <dp> yes. but I want it to happen immediately after the toggleClass
[11:15:05] <robertmaxrees> because that'd be .trigger()
[11:15:11] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('post'), specifically.
[11:15:53] <dp> well, I guess, no then. I want to make an AJAX submission. but I want to make sure it happens immediately after toggleClass()
[11:16:11] <robertmaxrees> then put your code after the toggleClass() call.
[11:16:52] <cjohnson> you can chain jquery collection methods but $.foo methods don't generally work like that
[11:17:50] <robertmaxrees> *most jquery collection methods.
[11:18:15] <dp> copy. thanks.
[11:34:07] <stephen> dp: Use promises
[11:34:38] <robertmaxrees> he left a while ago.
[11:39:08] <Robdgreat> this place is too classy for dp anyway
[11:39:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:39:20] <Robdgreat> here all week
[11:45:53] <nak> which characters need to be escaped in brackets when i do an expression like $("foo[...]") ?
[11:46:01] <nak> so far i know "/" needs to be escaped
[11:46:03] <nak> any others ?
[11:46:50] <NoiseEee> nak: what?
[11:47:27] <nak> $("a[href=http://invalid]") vs $("a[href='http:\/\/valid']")
[11:47:54] <nak> or hrm maybe it just needs quotes
[11:47:58] * nak checks
[11:49:12] <nak> ah okay nevermind
[11:49:29] <nak> $("a[href='http://valid']")
[11:49:38] <nak> all i needed was the single quotes around the url
[11:49:44] <nak> THANKS, ME
[11:49:50] <nak> thanks for making me question myself, NoiseEee
[11:49:58] <nak> it helped me find the solution
[11:50:09] <BillCriswell> When I have to escape I tend to use filter.
[11:51:04] <NoiseEee> nak: no worries. i solved a huge problem the other day with rubber duck debugging
[11:51:40] <nak> ^.^
[11:51:48] <nak> bless the rubber duck
[11:53:30] <aleray> using this layout http://jsfiddle.net/gc4x8ras/4/ is there a way to make the nav element sticky when it reaches top?
[11:57:25] <cjohnson> position: fixed
[11:57:41] <cjohnson> and read the scroll event to determine whether it should be fixed or not
[11:57:54] <cjohnson> bind to the scroll event and read the scroll position, scrollTop
[12:02:14] <aleray> cjohnson, the problem is that my element is nested in an element that is left floated
[12:09:35] <Azrael_-> hi
[12:10:38] <cjohnson> aleray: http://jsfiddle.net/j00k9kym/
[12:19:06] <_DB> sup guys im having a problem with an onclick , when I onclick it is supposed to simulate a onclick of a file uploader (single image) but for some reason it is submitting the form and opening up the file uploade
[12:20:04] <aleray> cjohnson, so if I don't specify a left value it will stay at the same place?
[12:20:16] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ _DB
[12:20:16] <b-ot> _DB: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:20:50] <JackLias> Hello!
[12:22:35] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/nnrjbvmz/
[12:29:18] <robertmaxrees> _DB you need to .preventDefault() on the submit event of the form.
[12:30:15] <_DB> robertmazrees I have that?
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:30:40] <_DB> yeah..lol
[12:30:43] <_DB> its on the fiddle
[12:30:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, are you in a document ready?
[12:30:58] <_DB> yeah
[12:31:21] <_DB> i just didnt add the doc ready to the script i uploaded
[12:32:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd abstract stuff out and not route through your UI in the first place if possible.
[12:40:56] <greek> Hi all. I'm using a droppable element (a table row) which grows in length when I drop cells into it. The table resides within a div of fixed width. The more cells I drop into the table, the more it grows, but when the table reaches the right-hand edge of the container div, it no longer allows me drop cells. Any idea how to overcome this so that the table keeps growing beyond the div's border?
[12:49:07] <rubyonrailed> How can I have something like this resize text with html tags?  http://jsfiddle.net/MYSVL/1064/
[12:50:25] <cjohnson> why not media queries instead of all this JS?
[12:52:06] <rubyonrailed> I'm not sure
[12:52:34] <Oka> >.>
[12:55:28] <rubyonrailed> Does anyone have an example wiht media queries
[12:55:46] <NoiseEee> rubyonrailed: i don't get what your goal is
[12:56:02] <NoiseEee> make text fit into a box no matter what the legibility?
[12:56:38] <rubyonrailed> Yeah, it resizes html tags with text to fit into the box.
[13:34:06] <stangeland> i am trying to update an image on button click, so i do this: $('.completionimgcontainer').empty().append('<img src="/static/img/completion.png"/>') but the image is not being updatd. How do i ensure the image is refreshed every time the button is clicked?
[13:35:17] <BillCriswell> stangeland: Like.. nocaching?
[13:35:28] <stangeland> BillCriswell, yeah
[13:36:10] <BillCriswell> Is the image being sent with the right http headers?
[13:36:35] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, add a cachebust to the end of the URL.
[13:36:35] <BillCriswell> You should set it to expire sometime in the past and the browser shouldn't cache it.
[13:39:02] <stangeland> BillCriswell, ahh fixed it
[13:39:10] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[13:39:27] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I can convince my girlfriend jackalope's are real.
[13:39:39] <stangeland> is she pretty?
[13:39:44] <BillCriswell> yes
[13:39:50] <stangeland> then no
[13:40:01] <BillCriswell> i can'tt tell if she's buying it or not.
[13:40:40] <BillCriswell> She's not.
[13:40:42] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> this is when you plant the seed: guacamole is in fact not a vegetarian dish
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> on account of you use guacamoles to make it.

[13:55:27] <kinesis> Hey, ,how can I detect by selector  when a div is overflowing? I have a masonry.js problem where a certain zoom level causes a div to bounce around like crazy...
[13:55:39] <kinesis> I need to detect when this happens and resize by css this div.
[13:58:23] <kinesis>  I have a masonry.js problem where a certain zoom level causes a div to bounce around like crazy... Does that mean that the bouncing div is overflowing? I need to resize it somehow by css.
[14:08:07] <regedit> hello
[14:09:37] <regedit> how do i operate on 2 separate jQuery selections at once?
[14:09:41] <regedit> eg. $('.some-selector) and $('.nother-selector').parentsUntil('.wtvr')
[14:09:54] <regedit> i'd like to do jQuery stuff upon both of them
[14:10:14] <cjohnson> you can do '.a, .b' to select both
[14:10:26] <cjohnson> if you already have 2 collections, there's a method to concat tthem let me check
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> that parentsuntil will prevent that from working though.
[14:10:31] <regedit> not when i need to obtain something's parentsUntil() though...
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> you can use .add()
[14:11:03] <robertmaxrees> $('.some-selector).add($('.nother-selector').parentsUntil('.wtvr')).someMethod()
[14:11:24] <regedit> ok great, thanks!
[14:11:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to modify the original collection btw.
[14:11:53] <robertmaxrees> check out the documentation.
[14:12:13] <regedit> i dont need it to, just wanna operate on both
[14:18:42] <kinesis> What would cause a masonry.js layout to bounce around at a certain zoom level? is it the horizontal overflow?
[14:19:14] <NoiseEee> kinesis: i'd check out masonry.js forums/support
[14:22:56] <kinesis>  They don't have one. The guy works at Twitter and is affluent. He's too busy to support masonry.
[14:23:29] <cjohnson> sounds like a consideration for choosing another tool or mastering it yourself
[14:23:59] <kinesis> Well I just want to detect whether the script is locked on placing that div over and over and resize it's css if it is.
[14:25:12] <cjohnson> well I just want to detect when a user is engaged in my content but there is no user.isActivelyPayingAttention() ;)
[14:25:24] <kinesis> I can help you
[14:25:34] <kinesis> We can trade.
[14:26:36] <regedit> what does 'return;' do within a .submit() handler? is it like returning false - cancels the submit?
[14:26:56] <cjohnson> it just stops executing the rest of the code in the handler
[14:27:03] <cjohnson> it's probably inside a conditional yes?
[14:27:10] <regedit> but will otherwise continue with form submission?
[14:27:49] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/jboxzwoa/
[14:27:56] <kinesis> Hey what's an event for when the user Zooms the browser in and out? Ctrl + -
[14:28:02] <kinesis> hmm..
[14:28:17] <regedit> in javascript null and undefined is often interchangable with false, and returning nothing is returning null or undefined, i think
[14:28:54] <regedit> cjwelborn: ROFL spectacular success
[14:29:01] <regedit> er cjohnson
[14:29:32] <regedit> must make jsfiddle-ception... *dramatic peer* 3 levels deep!...
[14:30:01] <cjohnson> often yes, but if the code is explicitly testing with === it's not interchangeable
[14:30:20] <cjohnson> I suspect jquery's .on dispatcher will only e.preventDefault if return value === false given the above fiddle
[14:32:40] <regedit> cjohnson: ok thanks
[14:48:07] <kinesis> I have the same problem as Hollman in this log: http://organicsearch.agency/conversations/i-need-to-detect-when-this/
[14:51:17] <cjohnson> yeah you asked already :P
[15:48:13] <Renarii> Can someone tell me the proper way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/zwj4v659/ It seems the selector is failing for some reason.
[15:49:17] <robertmaxrees> probably expect a non-jquery object.
[15:53:55] <Renarii> I'll ask in #javascript since it doesn't seem to be working with standard javascript selectors either. Thanks.
[15:56:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:15:13] <systemfault> Heh
[17:30:01] <Sherafff> i'm doing .focus() on a select/option element, it focus it, but it doesn't let me navigate the options with the arrow keys
[17:30:04] <Sherafff> is there a trick for that?
[17:33:33] <Sherafff> nevermind, it works, just doesn't work when i do it from the console
[17:44:04] <Xamper> If I dynamically add elements to the DOM with append(), can those elements then be selected with a jquery selector? or does that only work with elements that are loaded in the browser via the initial .html file?
[17:44:56] <doug64k> Xamper: yes they can be selected
[17:45:20] <Xamper> doug64k: Via the same process?
[17:45:24] <doug64k> yes
[17:46:00] <Xamper> doug64k: Ok thanks
[17:46:29] <doug64k> Xamper: are you having a problem with events?
[17:48:12] <doug64k> Xamper: this won't work: $('#doesnotexistyet').on('click', ...
[17:48:44] <doug64k> Xamper: but this would work no matter what: $(document).on('click', '#doesnotexistyet', ...
[17:49:11] <doug64k> more realistically, the selector would be a class
[17:51:53] <systemfault> IDs suck, we should just forget about them (Except for anchors)
[17:52:22] <doug64k> yeah ids do suck
[17:52:39] <Sherafff> Xamper: if you want to bind event to them you may have to use .live()
[17:53:11] <Xamper> doug64k: Sorta. I was trying to do $('#doesnotexistyet').append()
[17:53:16] <Xamper> Is that possible?
[17:53:22] <Sherafff> actually it's deprecated ...
[17:53:25] <doug64k> Sherafff: live is obsolete though
[17:53:32] <Sherafff> but check here if you need http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359018/in-jquery-how-to-attach-events-to-dynamic-html-elements
[17:53:58] <systemfault> .live is .dead :P
[17:54:05] <doug64k> Xamper: when does it exist. do you need to wait for document ready?
[17:54:23] <doug64k> $(function() { $('#mightexistbynow')... })
[17:54:44] <doug64k> it will wait for all of the elements to exist before running that function
[17:54:57] <Xamper> doug64k: Ok let me explain the scenario to you
[17:57:56] <Xamper> doug64k: It's a blogging app. The user post and its comments are dynamically loaded on page load using ajax with php/mysql. Now, in order for someone to be able to post a comment on that post, they will need access to the access to the id tag of the post (which is added to the dom dynamically)
[17:58:10] <Xamper> Do you see where I am going with this?
[17:58:44] <Xamper> *access to the id tag
[17:59:36] <Xamper> Well, not them, but me, I'll need access to the id tag of the post after the submit button event
[17:59:44] <Xamper> so I can do the database work
[18:21:18] <Sherafff> anyway to get a callback when .collapse("hide") from bootstrap is done?
[18:21:33] <Sherafff> .collapse("show") actually, whatever ...
[18:22:01] <Sherafff> i want to scroll and the focus on an input field after the collapse is shown
[18:22:33] <Sherafff> but for now, as there is no callback, it try to scroll to something that is hidden, and just go to a wrong position
[18:22:36] <Sherafff> i get a timeout..
[18:25:34] <Sherafff> i guess*
[18:39:00] <BillCriswell> Sherafff: There's a shown.bs.collapse event.
[18:39:55] <BillCriswell> Sherafff: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-usage look at the "events" section.
[18:39:58] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/Lc0jrrrc/1/ Well... I wanted to showcasea  bug here, instead I'm getting an error of "TypeError: this.source is not a function"
[18:40:19] <innociv_> Oh wait
[18:42:52] <innociv_> nvm i see that issue
[19:00:27] <Sherafff> BillCriswell: yeah, but i need a callback, then i can pass an argument (the id of the field i need to focus ..)
[19:03:08] <doug64k> Sherafff: try $(selector).promise().done(function() { ... anim is done ... });
[19:03:18] <doug64k> where selector selects the animating element(s)
[19:03:43] <doug64k> after you start the collapse thing
[19:08:58] <doug64k> Xamper: you probably want to use .closest to find the element for the post the find from there to get the descendent you need
[19:09:06] <doug64k> then .find from there*
[19:15:23] <BillCriswell> Sherafff: Where are you getting the id from?
[19:16:59] <Sherafff> an ajax response
[19:18:33] <BillCriswell> Sherafff: Are you trying to do something like? $.get('/id').done(function(id){ $collapse.on('shown.bs.collapse', function () { /* Something with id */ }); });
[19:21:35] <Sherafff> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/rXtAtp6e
[19:22:33] <Sherafff> i could be using the event with a global variable that let the function fired know what is the input to focus on, but i don't want to do it that way :(
[19:22:41] <BillCriswell> I don't click pastebin links lol
[19:23:06] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/jolukuqoci/1/edit?html,js,output can you put you code in here?
[19:24:18] <Sherafff> oO
[19:24:27] <Sherafff> ok
[19:24:31] <Sherafff> what's wrong with pastebin?
[19:24:55] <Sherafff> the code won't work in there, i would have to setup the whole thing..
[19:25:21] <Sherafff> i fixed it with a timeout so it's fine..
[19:25:44] <BillCriswell> The full page ads with video and sound turned on automatically.
[19:26:04] <Sherafff> it's either, i use a timeout, or i use a global var for the fired function by the event to know the ID
[19:26:11] <Sherafff> or i edit the code of bootstrap.js
[19:26:24] <Sherafff> to support callback
[19:26:56] <BillCriswell> I'm having a hard time following, but ok.
[20:18:06] <JoaquinLeon> Hi
[20:18:59] <JoaquinLeon> Someone can help me?
[21:00:15] <innociv_> How do I select the index of a selector based on what index it is of a class within its container?
[21:05:53] <BillCriswell> innociv_: $lis.index($('.some-class-on-some-li'))
[21:06:10] <BillCriswell> or if you already have a plain element you can pass it that.
[21:06:21] <BillCriswell> $lis.index(el);
[21:06:27] <innociv_> Yeah I'm trying that, but something is going weird when I try using .siblings('.class').addBack()
[21:06:50] <BillCriswell> I don't see the relation.
[21:08:05] <innociv_> $('#somediv p:eq(1)').index(
[21:08:12] <innociv_> wtf
[21:08:13] <innociv_> my keyboard is messing up
[21:08:31] <innociv_> I can't make a less than three. Holy shit
[21:08:50] <BillCriswell> That'll make development pretty tough.
[21:12:08] <innociv_> BillCriswell,  http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/1/
[21:13:02] <BillCriswell> innociv_: I usually do better with code, but I need an explanation here.
[21:13:18] <innociv_> it's one line :x  I want the index of the second p in the second div, where all I know is the 2nd p element.
[21:14:12] <innociv_> Oh oops I put indeX() in there twice
[21:15:03] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/2/ Okay here.
[21:15:11] <innociv_> From what I understand, this should be returning 1, not -1
[21:17:26] <BillCriswell> It sounds to me like you want 3?
[21:17:41] <innociv_> No
[21:17:51] <BillCriswell> The index of the second <p> element in #somediv is 3.
[21:17:58] <innociv_> I want index of similar elements of their contain
[21:18:22] <BillCriswell> so just among the <p> tags?
[21:18:51] <innociv_> among the p tags in its container.
[21:19:52] <BillCriswell> ...
[21:20:43] <Ansikt> .siblings('p') ?
[21:21:32] <Ansikt> wait, whoa, what
[21:21:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah I'm lost.
[21:21:56] <Ansikt> I just read the messages....I wasn't expecting that fiddle
[21:22:37] <BillCriswell> $('#somediv p').eq(2) will return the second <p> tag in that container.
[21:22:53] <gf3> *element
[21:22:55] <gf3> not tag
[21:23:24] <Ansikt> it sounds like he wants the index of the element with the index of 1....so....1?
[21:23:43] <BillCriswell> gf3: I'm notmrally pretty good about that.
[21:23:51] <innociv_> I tried siblings('p').addBack()
[21:23:59] <Ansikt> Oh, I see
[21:24:00] <innociv_> It just does not work like it should
[21:24:08] <gf3> BillCriswell: if u fuck up again you're out of here, bub
[21:24:12] <innociv_> Like .siblings('p').addBack() creates the correct list if you log it
[21:24:18] <BillCriswell> I so sowwy
[21:24:25] <innociv_> but the index() function is not seelcting the right index from that list
[21:24:29] <innociv_> it seems to be a jQuery bug...
[21:24:37] <Ansikt> So,no, it's correct
[21:24:47] <BillCriswell> I'm glad someone can follow this.
[21:24:50] <Ansikt> it's counting the h1.
[21:25:00] <innociv_> um, how is it correct in returning -1?
[21:25:09] <innociv_> Or counting the h1 when the h1 is not a p?
[21:25:20] <Ansikt> Because you're filtering really specifically.
[21:25:26] <innociv_> ?..
[21:25:32] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/3/
[21:25:33] <Ansikt> and because that's not how index works.
[21:25:49] <innociv_> Look again and explain how that's "correct" and how to correctly get what I actually want? :/
[21:25:59] <Ansikt> So, what is the number you're expecting?
[21:26:03] <innociv_> 1
[21:26:12] <innociv_> It's saying it's not in there. When it is
[21:26:12] <BillCriswell> innociv_: You've overcomplicating something. I just have no idea what.
[21:26:20] <innociv_> I am not
[21:26:25] <BillCriswell> You definitely are.
[21:26:29] <innociv_> I am not
[21:26:52] <innociv_> If I hover over the first logged object in firebug, I see it's that 2nd p.  If I hover over the other 3, I see the one before it, it, and the one after
[21:26:57] <innociv_> So that p is in that list but it's returning -1
[21:27:18] <innociv_> If that's not how index() works then how else do I get "1" out of there?
[21:28:33] <Ansikt> So you want to find the index of the element with an index of 1?
[21:28:41] <Ansikt> isn't that a tautology?
[21:28:52] <Oka> Mm.
[21:28:57] <innociv_> Yes to the first questin
[21:28:59] <Ansikt> At first I thought you wanted to count the h1 too....but...no?
[21:29:04] <innociv_> No. I don't
[21:29:14] <innociv_> index() by itself with no argument will count the h1
[21:29:50] <innociv_> I want the REVERSE of "$('#somediv p:eq(1)')"
[21:30:27] <Ansikt> but you're selecting by index so...
[21:30:30] <innociv_> Omg
[21:30:33] <innociv_> That's for an example
[21:30:34] <Ansikt> var index = 1;
[21:30:40] <innociv_> The code in my applicatin is not 1 line
[21:30:50] <innociv_> You want the whole 3000 lines of code?...
[21:31:07] <Oka> We want you to describe a logical issue.
[21:31:12] <BillCriswell> I'd be absolutely terrified to see that code.
[21:31:23] <innociv_> I don't know how to better describe it than that jsfiddle
[21:32:00] <innociv_> I know the element. I don't know it's index compared to similar siblings
[21:32:00] <Oka> $('#somediv').children('p').eq(0).index();
[21:32:04] <Oka> Is this what you want?
[21:32:13] <innociv_> Huh?... Why would that not be 0?
[21:32:13] <Ansikt> I think what you want is:http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/5/
[21:32:39] <innociv_> yes
[21:32:43] <Ansikt> with an argument it counts within the collection - without, it counts among siblings
[21:32:49] <innociv_> ..
[21:32:50] <innociv_> no
[21:32:53] <innociv_> no that' snot what I want
[21:32:57] <innociv_> Taht's just a way to return "1"
[21:33:03] <innociv_> I don't know the index!
[21:33:05] <innociv_> I need to find the index!
[21:33:28] <innociv_> Selecting an element with an example index is just an example so I can try and find the index!
[21:33:28] <BillCriswell> The index of the second p in #somediv amongst the p's... right?
[21:34:06] <innociv_> The index of an element, compared to SIBLING elements of a KNOWN class.
[21:34:15] <innociv_> Everything is unknown except the class of the element I need siblings of.
[21:34:25] <innociv_> the index of it compared to its siblings, rather
[21:34:45] <innociv_> If I already knew the index was "1", I don't know why people would think I wouldn't just put a variable of "1"....
[21:35:31] <Ansikt> innociv_, http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/7/
[21:36:02] <Ansikt> right exactly - that's what I was complaining about earlier when you were telling us you wanted the index of the second element.
[21:36:02] <innociv_> I DO NOT
[21:36:09] <innociv_> KNOW THE SELECTOR FOR THE PARENT
[21:36:27] <innociv_> The ONLY thing I know is the class of what I'm getting an index of.
[21:36:46] <Ansikt> The selector I added is to the child.
[21:36:55] <BillCriswell> I'm so annoyed but I want to understand what the hell you're asking.
[21:37:03] <Oka> I know, right BillCriswell.
[21:37:12] <Ansikt> not the parent.  Unless you mean the parent...which you had in your original example???
[21:37:37] <Ansikt> The element I added a selector to has literally no children
[21:37:56] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/8/ It needs to do this, if only it worked like it should.
[21:38:07] <innociv_> What that code says to do, I need to do. But apparently index() doesn't work like that.
[21:39:45] <innociv_> The only thing I have is a selector for an element, and I need the index of it compared to siblings of the same class in the same container.  A string fed into index() will not give this result.
[21:39:57] <innociv_> I don't understand what a selector supplied to index() is supposed to do if not this
[21:40:53] <innociv_> element supplied, rather
[21:41:26] <sacho_> what makes you think .addBack() returns a string..?
[21:42:02] <innociv_> I don't
[21:43:18] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/10/  See the logged element?  I need to find what index it is relative to those 3 logged elements.
[21:43:25] <sacho_> ok, what makes you think addBack() places your element as the first element in the jquery object?
[21:43:50] <innociv_> I don't think taht either...
[21:44:18] <innociv_> .siblings selects OTHER elements. It doesn't include what you are selecting siblings of. How would I find an index from a list that doesn't include the element?
[21:44:36] <sacho_> I know what the functions do
[21:44:45] <sacho_> but you're using them completely incorrectly
[21:44:53] <innociv_> Okay
[21:45:03] <innociv_> But how do I answer my original questn?
[21:45:06] <innociv_> on
[21:45:07] <innociv_> oge
[21:45:15] <innociv_> my keyboardi s so fucked up
[21:45:26] <sacho_> your original question is like 50 pages above and you just asked "I need to do what these functions are doing"
[21:45:32] <innociv_> How do I get the index of an element, out of other similar elements in the same container?
[21:45:36] <sacho_> so I had to go back and read what it was..
[21:45:45] <sacho_> addBack() wouldn't help you, it doesn't place the element back in its spot.
[21:45:51] <innociv_> I've asked and clarified that like 10 times, and don't know what else to say
[21:45:57] <sacho_> (because there is no such spot)
[21:46:01] <BillCriswell> What is "similar"?
[21:46:02] <innociv_> Oh. True.
[21:46:11] <innociv_> I know the elements class, that's it.
[21:46:27] <Ansikt> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/13/
[21:46:31] <innociv_> And addBack() problem is irrelevant
[21:46:33] <sacho_> innociv_, http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/14/
[21:46:39] <innociv_> when parent().children('p') doesn't work
[21:46:56] <sacho_> doesn't work because?
[21:47:01] <innociv_> That is wrong.
[21:47:05] <innociv_> It is index 1 not 2
[21:47:09] <innociv_> Index 2 counts the h1
[21:47:26] <sacho_> http://jsfiddle.net/0ar12pum/15/
[21:47:29] <sacho_> ..
[21:47:29] <Ansikt> sacho_, My answer's the same as yours, just filter for the p
[21:47:42] <innociv_> I think ansikt might work
[21:47:43] <Ansikt> yup
[21:47:45] <sacho_> so why doesn't children('p') work?
[21:47:48] <Ansikt> it does
[21:47:49] <Ansikt> same deal
[21:47:55] <innociv_> Yes ansikt's is right
[21:47:55] <Ansikt> yours is probably more accurate
[21:47:58] <Oka> children is better than find in this case
[21:48:30] <sacho_> ugh, your initial question was such an xy
[21:48:32] <BillCriswell> That was the most convoluted quesiton I've ever experienced in here.
[21:48:39] <innociv_> I don't understand what is so confusing about my questin
[21:48:56] <sacho_> <innociv_> How do I select the index of a selector based on what index it is of a class within its container? <--
[21:49:12] <innociv_> "How do I find the index of an element out of other elements that are the same class in the same container"
[21:49:33] <innociv_> Okay, I worded it really bad in that particular instance
[21:50:40] <BillCriswell> $('.my-el').prevAll('p').length could also work for some old school fun.
[21:51:31] <Ansikt> BillCriswell, That's clever.
[21:52:22] <BillCriswell> I'm sure I stole it from some cleverer person in here.
[21:52:33] <Uhkis> thief!
[21:52:46] <innociv_> Yeah that's good.
[21:53:09] <innociv_> probably more efficient. I don't know.
[21:54:23] <BillCriswell> Looks like some nerds were on top of it: http://jsperf.com/jquery-index-vs-prevall/4
[22:23:41] <innociv_> Nice
[22:25:45] <innociv_> Wow. Way faster than even simple .index() usage
[22:51:49] <root3d> could anyone help in debugging https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/23a27db894ee5ba350e9
[22:52:09] <root3d> slideup and down should work that way.
[22:55:46] <root3d> damn it.. calling on other div & expecting on other div.. gotcha..
