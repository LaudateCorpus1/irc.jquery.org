[11:00:16] <sdfgdfsgsdfg> hey, i'm getting a 522 when trying to download the latest release
[11:03:24] <shoky> yep seems the site is down
[11:05:41] <sdfgdfsgsdfg> can i just get the latest release from someone here? :D
[11:06:27] <sdfgdfsgsdfg> oh it's working now nm
[11:06:29] <shoky> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery
[11:06:48] <sdfgdfsgsdfg> thank you!
[11:52:24] <thusara97> hello
[11:52:52] <thusara97> I would like to know the future of the jquery migrate plugin?
[14:54:21] <SkitsVicious> can i :contain on onclick attributes?
[15:03:58] <SkitsVicious> i got this
[15:04:00] <SkitsVicious> `jQuery('.cell.offer__merchant').children('a').first().attr('href')
[15:04:05] <SkitsVicious> Â´jQuery('.cell.offer__merchant').children('a').first().attr('href')
[15:04:16] <SkitsVicious> w/e the fokken code prefix is
[15:04:36] <SkitsVicious> it gives me the href of the anchor
[15:04:46] <SkitsVicious> i need to check whether there is a certain string in that href
[15:04:49] <SkitsVicious> how would i do that?
[15:05:59] <SkitsVicious> got it.
[15:07:03] <vaidesh> you can use regex for matching that string within that href
[15:15:29] <SkitsVicious> what's the <code> control character?
[15:16:14] <SkitsVicious> anyway, why does jQuery('.cell.offer__merchant a').attr('href') only match the first occurance of a?
[15:18:17] <pavonia> .attr() only returns a single result (of the first matched element)
[15:18:26] <SkitsVicious> jQuery('.cell.offer__merchant a') matches all of them
[15:18:36] <SkitsVicious> oh.
[15:19:13] <SkitsVicious> is there somehting like a.href:contains('foo') the?
[15:19:21] <SkitsVicious> then*
[15:20:12] <pavonia> Is this what you want to apply to the result or to use a filter?
[15:20:21] <pavonia> *as filter
[15:21:48] <SkitsVicious> idk tbh
[15:22:12] <SkitsVicious> my problem is that the .attr only applies to the first result.
[15:22:31] <SkitsVicious> do i need to iterate through all of them?
[15:23:08] <pavonia> It depends on what you are trying to achieve
[15:23:23] <SkitsVicious> do you want me to show it to you?
[15:24:06] <SkitsVicious> it's not a big deal for you i am sure.
[15:25:34] <pavonia> Well yes :p
[15:25:39] <pavonia> or explain
[15:25:47] <SkitsVicious> https://geizhals.at/toshiba-n300-nas-systems-8tb-hdwg180uzsva-a2301745.html?hloc=at&hloc=de&hloc=eu&hloc=pl&hloc=uk#offerlist
[15:26:05] <SkitsVicious> you see in the list the second td with names of the vendors?
[15:26:15] <SkitsVicious> i want to highlight the cell for certain vendors.
[15:26:35] <SkitsVicious> jQuery('.cell.offer__merchant a').attr('href')
[15:26:52] <SkitsVicious> but the problem is it only returns the first match.
[15:28:22] <pavonia> You want .filter() or .each() on the result set, and check for each entry .attr()
[15:30:03] <pavonia> .each(function () { if ($(this).attr("href").contains("foo")) { ... highlight cell ... } }) something like this
[15:30:52] <pavonia> or collect the results with .filter() and apply .css() to the whole set
[15:31:33] <SkitsVicious> i'm not familiar with filter. i'll read into it. thanks for far :)
[16:12:49] <SkitsVicious> general question: is tampermonkey still state of the art?
[16:13:54] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to look at the last time it was released.
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> assuming by "state of the art" you mean "still maintained" - not really sure what you're actually asking there SkitsVicious
[16:15:33] <SkitsVicious> well.
[16:15:41] <SkitsVicious> is there something newer and better than it?
[16:16:06] <robertmaxrees> gotcha - dunno.  i'd search google, but my guess is that it's still one of the big players.
[16:16:29] <SkitsVicious> you do not use tampermonkey or alike?
[16:16:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.  also: this whole convo is way off topic for the channel ;)
[16:23:58] <SkitsVicious> indeed. :D
