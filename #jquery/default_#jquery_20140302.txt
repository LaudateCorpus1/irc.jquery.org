[00:07:17] <leshanks> Hi all - in http://jsfiddle.net/eXJeG/1/ (very simplified example), how can I reference the position in the array (without being dependant on 'i' from the loop)?
[00:07:57] <leshanks> In that example, it should return 2
[00:17:02] <Draleth> Is it possible to register a callback for when elements matching a selector are added to the dom?
[00:17:36] <Draleth> I.e. I want to call $(elements).timeago(); any time a "time.relative" element is added.
[00:19:30] <systemfault> Not really, there's a way but it only works on really recent browsers.
[00:20:22] <Draleth> How recent?  Link to a caniuse?
[00:21:18] <systemfault> http://caniuse.com/#feat=mutationobserver
[00:21:34] <IronY> does anyone know anything about data tables :(
[00:21:42] <Draleth> Thanks Ob^H^H^H IE.  :|
[01:26:19] <back2basics> easy question i'm sure:  how do you append an <a> tag in a <div>.  I would like to use the .attr() fn to add on attributes like href in a dictionary style but then I have to reselect the <a> tag and I would like to consolidate these 2 calls.
[01:29:36] <tw2113> do all the attributes first, then append
[01:51:18] <lemarc> this is a function using which I am sending POST request to my flask API but the sucess function if Jquery ajax is not working, I am getting the post data in the server, code http://pastebin.com/bpBcvVFM
[01:56:01] <systemfault> lemarc: What status code is the server returning
[02:26:37] <drnick_naeluh> system fault
[02:26:51] <drnick_naeluh> haha
[02:39:55] <lemarc> systemfault, I am not getting any reply, so activity on ajax request and server is getting the data
[02:41:03] <systemfault> lemarc: add a error handler
[02:45:52] <lemarc> systemfault, I am getting this : Status: parsererror and Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token d as errorThrown
[02:46:16] <systemfault> It probably means that the JSON returned by the server is invalid.
[02:50:07] <lemarc> systemfault, this is my return statment in python "return json.dumps({'status':'saved'})"
[02:50:49] <lemarc> systemfault, and when I do parseJSON the returned data and console log it, it logs null in console.
[02:52:15] <systemfault> You need to look in your browser's web inspector
[02:52:26] <systemfault> Look at the return of the XHR
[02:52:35] <systemfault> Look at the status code and the response
[02:52:58] <lemarc> systemfault, found the error, I dont need to parseJSON the recived data, it already is a json object
[02:53:04] <systemfault> Yeah
[02:53:30] <systemfault> lemarc: That's what it does when you add "dataType: 'json'"
[02:54:19] <lemarc> I thought it was just for sending data, while receiving I thought I need to convert back to json as I am sending dump from backend
[02:55:46] <systemfault> lemarc: With "normal" ajax, you would need to do it. It's jquery that does the conversion from JSON -> JS for you
[02:56:46] <lemarc> systemfault, been struggling for an hour now, thanks :)
[03:50:36] <Tomashe> hey guys , anyone knows a fully working solution for copy text to clipboard
[03:50:38] <Tomashe> ?
[03:50:57] <asdasd> anyone around
[04:03:12] <greg5green> Tomashe, i'm not aware of any that don't use flash if you need older browser support
[04:03:21] <greg5green> otherwise look at the HTML5 Clipboard API
[05:41:37] <Tomashe> greg5green : there is nothing like that available
[07:21:52] <Jattenalle> http://i.imgur.com/fGjfWsm.jpg my UI is coming along nicely :)
[07:23:33] <decx> what is it?
[07:23:44] <Jattenalle> decx, what do you mean?
[07:23:58] <decx> what, is, it
[07:24:07] <decx> :D
[07:24:24] <Jattenalle> the UI is jquery and jquery UI, the game is an MMORTS, Gods and Idols :)
[07:24:34] <Jattenalle> no it's not a browser game :P
[07:24:43] <decx> ah
[07:25:00] <Jattenalle> just using HTML/JS for the interface
[07:25:09] <decx> i thought you made a cool canvas particle universe, that would be most excellent for me right now
[07:25:11] <decx> :D
[07:25:15] <Jattenalle> haha, sorry :P
[07:25:46] <decx> i'm actually trying to implement particles in a canvas experiment, rects are expensive
[07:26:15] <Jattenalle> hm, i havent mucked with webGL too much, but you have access to shaders and vertex buffer objects?
[07:26:28] <decx> 2d only
[07:26:59] <decx> i dont even understand how to deal with image data programmatically, i think i'll put webgl off for now ;)
[07:27:01] <Jattenalle> doesnt matter, if you can use gl shaders and VBO's you could literally have hundreds of millions of "stars"
[07:27:06] <Jattenalle> ah
[07:27:27] <Jattenalle> yeah, might be best to take one step at a time ;)
[07:28:36] <Jattenalle> well give me a poke if you ever need fancy rendered space vistas
[07:28:49] <webdev-noob> Hey guys! I simply can't figure out how to do the VERTICAL alignment on a JQuery UI Spinner, like here: http://bseth99.github.io/projects/jquery-ui/2-jquery-ui-spinner-orientation.html    Can anyone give me a minimalistic example?
[07:28:52] <Jattenalle> literally just go into my game and take a bunch of screenshots :3
[07:29:27] <Jattenalle> webdev-noob, what has you stumped?
[07:29:38] <webdev-noob> The buttons will simply stay on the right
[07:29:54] <Jattenalle> do you have live code you can show?
[07:30:01] <Jattenalle> jsfiddle
[07:30:26] <webdev-noob> unfortunately not. what I have is an input on which I call .spinner with alignment. the thing I don't get is where these alignments are defined
[07:30:35] <webdev-noob> are they even at jquery ui per default?
[07:30:52] <decx> damn
[07:31:07] <decx> so much code for that spinner
[07:31:13] <Jattenalle> webdev-noob, looking at the source of the page you linked, it's using standard jquery stuff+ ui-spinner-vertical
[07:31:45] <webdev-noob> wait i try to put together a jsfiddle
[07:31:52] <decx> i actually made one myself a while ago http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xv5mf/3/
[07:31:54] <Jattenalle> webdev-noob, try having a look here http://bseth99.github.io/projects/jquery-ui/spinner-layout/jquery.ui.spinner.css
[07:31:58] <Jattenalle> it's the CSS your link loads
[07:32:06] <Jattenalle> *-vertical most likely what you're after
[07:32:20] <Jattenalle> seems it also changes some of the default jquery ui css
[07:32:56] <Jattenalle> decx, ooh, i like
[07:33:57] <webdev-noob> Well, I'm using that now: <input class=".ui-spinner-vertical" id="spinner" name="spinner" value="0.0">
[07:34:02] <webdev-noob> ah
[07:34:19] <decx> i probably missed 50 edgecases, every spinner i'm looking at has like 500 lines Jattenalle ;)
[07:34:29] <webdev-noob> wont change anything
[07:34:53] <Jattenalle> decx, looks solid enough to me :) mind if i use it?
[07:35:26] <webdev-noob> Well now the buttons vanished?
[07:35:41] <Jattenalle> webdev-noob, did you copy the css from that site? and the html it uses
[07:35:41] <decx> go ahead, Jattenalle
[07:35:42] <webdev-noob> http://jsfiddle.net/JZHb3/
[07:35:48] <webdev-noob> try this fiddle?
[07:35:49] <Jattenalle> decx, ty :)
[07:35:50] <decx> if you notice problems just fork that :>
[07:35:54] <Jattenalle> will do
[07:36:56] <webdev-noob> The difference is, at my local example even the input box is vanished.
[07:37:45] <Jattenalle> webdev-noob, just have to keep fiddling with it, sounds like you're missing something somewhere
[07:38:05] <webdev-noob> It doesnt work in the jsfiddle as well
[07:39:39] <webdev-noob> fiddling for over 2 hours. cant get it working hah :)
[07:39:53] <decx> you're not loading the spinner.js
[07:39:59] <decx> ^^
[07:40:29] <webdev-noob> which?
[07:40:54] <decx> /jquery.ui.spinner.js
[07:41:10] <Jattenalle> yeah you need jqueryui with its widgets
[07:41:17] <Jattenalle> i believe spinner relies on some other ones (not sure)
[07:42:30] <webdev-noob> I got it!
[07:42:36] <webdev-noob> but the style of the button is
[07:42:42] <webdev-noob> on my local copy just small blue buttons
[07:43:08] <webdev-noob> how come he has that cool grey buttons
[07:43:17] <Jattenalle> that'd be jquery ui css, you need to either change the overall style, or just use another css definition for it
[07:45:07] <webdev-noob> Might it be that i dont have these "icons"? down: "ui-icon-triangle-1-s",
[07:45:29] <Jattenalle> they're part of whatever jquery ui theme you've grabbed, if you dont have one, then you dont have the icons
[07:45:39] <Jattenalle> just missing the icons shouldnt affect the overall style of the button
[07:45:44] <webdev-noob> where can i grab a jquery ui theme
[07:46:01] <edoop> if you want cocnentred on a big medium-big idea and want to stard from 0 IDe, what ide would you choice?
[07:46:02] <Jattenalle> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ knock yourself out :)
[07:46:14] <webdev-noob> is there a bootstrap like
[07:46:40] <webdev-noob> what is this. how do i use this
[07:46:53] <webdev-noob> cant i just "include" or "set" a theme?
[07:47:11] <Jattenalle> click gallery, pick one you like, either download or edit it
[07:47:18] <Jattenalle> once downloaded you just use it as any other css
[07:50:09] <webdev-noob> incorporated the css
[07:50:14] <webdev-noob> didnt change anything. LOL
[07:50:32] <decx> right click, inspect check which styles are applying
[07:50:54] <decx> inspect and console.log all the things, it'll make your life much easier
[07:53:15] <webdev-noob> I just took smoothness but grrr

[09:42:01] <decx> i never worked with bootstraps carousel
[09:42:35] <decx> why are you trying to override this.indicators?
[09:43:14] <skypce> yes, i try to use indicators outside of the main div
[09:43:22] <skypce> of carousels
[09:43:33] <decx> but dont just overide it
[09:43:34] <skypce> the error ignore it
[09:43:43] <decx> that breaks the rest of your carousel
[09:44:00] <decx> i left it separate on purpose
[09:44:37] <skypce> very thank you decx
[09:46:54] <skypce> decx, if you have some css issue please tell me :D

[09:50:51] <skypce> mm
[09:51:08] <skypce> may be the thing that i will do it not the best practice
[09:51:23] <skypce> i will set the tag element in core of bootstrap
[09:51:38] <skypce> it is updated to 3.1 latest version
[09:51:54] <skypce> no need updates after long time
[09:52:13] <ankurk_> I just need to know how can I include live filter results while filtering through select?
[09:57:25] <Technical_13> If I have a table, and I know in this table there is a row with the first column = "<a href="//foo.bar">foo</s>" how do I get what is in column number 4 out of 5?  This is a DOM navigation question...
[09:58:37] <decx> $('td').eq(4) or $('td:nth-child(4)')
[09:58:42] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, use index access
[09:58:44] <Technical_13> $('table.thisClass').find('tr td a:contains("foo")').html(); gets me to the correct row and I need to know how to get to the 4td from there.
[09:58:52] <Jattenalle> what decx said ^^
[09:59:09] <decx> but put it in a context to minimize overhead
[09:59:24] <decx> $(myselector,parentcontext)
[09:59:46] <decx> so: $('td:nth-child(4)','#mytable')
[10:00:04] <decx> it's like $('#mytable').find('td...')
[10:00:07] <Technical_13> So, $('table.thisClass').find('td:nth-child(4)','tr td a:contains("foo")').html(); should work?
[10:00:09] <decx> but shorter
[10:00:56] <Technical_13> or $('td:nth-child(4)','table.thisClass tr td a:contains("foo")').html();  ?
[10:01:16] <decx> that's wrong syntax
[10:01:45] <decx> if you want to select multiple they have to be in teh same quotes
[10:01:59] <decx> $('.selector1, .selector2')
[10:02:21] <Technical_13> 'table.thisClass tr td a:contains("foo")' is in one set of quotes.
[10:02:34] <Technical_13> ?
[10:02:46] <decx> r $('td:nth-child(4), table.thisClass tr td a:contains("foo")').
[10:03:11] <Technical_13> but that's not the $('td:nth-child(4)','#mytable') that you just said.. lol
[10:03:31] <decx> context doesnt work like that if you want to select multiple
[10:03:37] <Technical_13> 'table.thisClass tr td a:contains("foo")' is my '#mytable'
[10:03:43] <decx> no
[10:03:44] <Technical_13> I only want the one cell.
[10:03:54] <Technical_13> I only want cell four
[10:03:54] <decx> that can't be a context for td
[10:04:17] <decx> context is one parent element
[10:05:07] <Technical_13> let me slap a fiddle together showing what I have, and what I want and you can show me what you mean.. just a sec..
[10:07:50] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, your selector is "all" of the td's, then you refer to the 4th one (the one you want) by index/child access
[10:08:35] <Jattenalle> just try what decx said, it's silly and confusing, but that's how CSS selectors work :P
[10:08:40] <Jattenalle> silly confusing and obnoxious :3
[10:08:40] <simpleuser> Hi there. I'm looking for a simple script to make appear or disappear ul lists. Any idea?
[10:09:01] <decx> $('ul').toggle() Kappa
[10:09:18] <Jattenalle> simpleuser, $('#mylist').hide() or .show() or .toggle()
[10:09:50] <decx> bets on what the implementation should be
[10:09:57] <decx> mine is on a submenu
[10:10:11] <Jattenalle> im going to go all out, and say it's some kind of homebrew accordion
[10:10:34] <decx> now we wait
[10:10:35] <simpleuser> ok thanks Jattenalle and decx
[10:10:46] <decx> cmon, dont leave us hanging here
[10:10:51] <simpleuser> ?
[10:10:56] <Technical_13> http://jsfiddle.net/ex3cL/1/  --- It should alert 42... it instead alerts 41... no good.
[10:10:56] <Jattenalle> what are you using it for simpleuser?
[10:11:03] <simpleuser> Jattenalle, oh ok
[10:11:11] <simpleuser> I'm using it to display a tree
[10:11:28] <simpleuser> And to be able to show or hide every level of it
[10:11:36] <decx> i think i won then
[10:11:37] <simpleuser> a list of embedded ul li
[10:11:47] <decx> self high five o/ \o
[10:12:03] <simpleuser> And why toggle is better?
[10:12:20] <decx> Technical_13 instead of relying on the content of a td, give the tr that you want to target a class
[10:12:26] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, alert($('tr:nth-child(2)').find('td:nth-child(4)').html()); ?
[10:12:31] <Technical_13> I can't
[10:12:35] <Jattenalle> if you always know which child it is
[10:12:40] <decx> and don't use alert but console, it will give you so much more
[10:13:07] <Technical_13> I can't change the structure of the table, that's in PHP which I don't have access to.
[10:14:16] <Technical_13> Okay... Maybe this will help explain... https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ACentralAuth&target=Technical-13 --- I want to get the edit count of the row for "en.wikipedia.org"
[10:14:37] <pom_life> I need a little help, I'm having a brainfart. > http://www.winningfundraising.net/ <   Here, directly beneath the header, there is a "Static_Content" table I'm using to hold three divs: Reviews, a slideshow, and Social. I placed them in a one-row table so they are in a straight line. For some reason, I can't think of how to place them correctly wit
[10:14:37] <pom_life> hout using a table. Using a table is archaic, a bandage solution and looks different in various browsers.
[10:14:48] <pom_life> Oh, shit, didn't mean to paste that here
[10:15:05] <Technical_13> I have no idea how many rows there are going to be (could be from 0-722).
[10:15:50] <Technical_13> But, I know that the first column of the row I want will always have an a element with a .html() of "en.wikipedia.org"
[10:16:36] <simpleuser> Jattenalle and decx : so you would recommend this ? http://jsfiddle.net/dqMPP/
[10:17:06] <Jattenalle> simpleuser, i'd make them actual links, so users know they can be clicked
[10:17:25] <Jattenalle> but sure, if that's what you need, it works :)
[10:17:56] <simpleuser> ok thanks :)
[10:18:29] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, so you dont really care about the entire table, just the rows that have the specific a href in them?
[10:18:44] <Technical_13> correct
[10:19:28] <decx> Technical_13 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ex3cL/3/
[10:19:59] <Technical_13> *sigh*  I'm guessing I'll have to do it the hard way and do a $('table.thisClass tr').each(function(){if($this.find('td a').html() === "foo"){useRow = $this.length}}); and then $('tr:nth-child(useRow)').find('td:nth-child(4)').html(); ??
[10:20:53] <Hilton> Can anyone suggest a plugin similar to Select2 which works a little better? In particular the "Tags" support (http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#tags) - I can use Bootstrap Typeahead for anything else. My problem with Select2, although it works great, is that the dropdown box is frequently drawn far below the page content for no apparent reason.
[10:21:42] <Technical_13> decx: that almost works, but it is http://jsfiddle.net/ex3cL/4/
[10:21:44] <Technical_13> :p
[10:22:01] <Jattenalle> Technical_13,  $('td a:contains("bar")').closest('tr').find('td')[3].innerHTML
[10:22:08] <Jattenalle> it's not pretty, it's not efficient, but it works :P
[10:22:09] <Technical_13> Yours was changing the 5th element.
[10:22:12] <decx> oh actually you can just skip the 3rd line
[10:22:20] <Jattenalle> add more selectors to the first one, to narrow it down to specific table
[10:22:55] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ex3cL/6/
[10:22:56] <decx> there
[10:22:57] <decx> one line
[10:23:04] <Jattenalle> http://jsfiddle.net/WD5fY/1/
[10:23:49] <Jattenalle> ooh, .eq()?
[10:24:03] <Jattenalle> nice, didnt know about that one
[10:24:20] <decx> :nth-child is just a shorthand for that i tihnk
[10:24:31] <decx> not a shorthand, an expression
[10:24:35] <Jattenalle> $('td a:contains("bar")').closest('tr').find('td').eq(3).html()
[10:25:22] <Jattenalle> one thing that's not been clear to me is, if you do $('thing stuff') how is that different from $(thing, stuff)
[10:25:31] <Jattenalle> err, add the missing ' to the second one
[10:25:38] <Jattenalle> it's the , between the two im not sure about
[10:25:52] <decx> you mean context?
[10:25:57] <Jattenalle> -> $('thing stuff') how is that different from $('thing, stuff')
[10:26:06] <decx> just multiple selectors
[10:26:10] <Hilton> Jattenalle: Same as CSS. "div p" looks for P within DIV. No other P, no DIVs at all. "div, p" matches all DIV and P anywhere.
[10:26:13] <decx> select all p and a $('p,a')
[10:26:25] <Jattenalle> Hilton, ah, yeah that's what i assumed :)
[10:26:44] <decx> but with many items on the page that can be horribly inefficient
[10:26:45] <Technical_13> Jattenalle: I expanded on what you had and: $('td a:contains("en.wikipedia.org")').closest('tr').find('td')[4].innerHTML.replace(/<\/?a(.*?)>/gi, '')
[10:26:48] <Technical_13> works perfectly.
[10:27:05] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, you might wanna change that [4].innerHTML to .eq(3).html()
[10:27:10] <Jattenalle> to keep it all as jquery
[10:27:14] <Hilton> Jattenalle: For example, I have in my code...             $.each(elem.find('input[name],textarea,select[name]'), function (k, inp) {
[10:27:57] <decx> i try not to use multiple selectors too much
[10:27:59] <Jattenalle> Hilton, aye
[10:28:17] <simpleuser> Jattenalle, decx : stupid question: I added <a href="#">...</a> to my ul elements to hide/show. The problem is that when I click on it, it put me on the top of the page
[10:28:18] <Hilton> Jattenalle: That matches all elements (beneath "elem" which I had saved from a previous query) which are an INPUT (WITH a name attribute, so I don't match controls I'm using for non-form input), a TEXTAREA, or a SELECT (again only with a name attribute).
[10:28:23] <simpleuser> Any idea to avoid this behavior?
[10:28:26] <Technical_13> $('td a:contains("en.wikipedia.org")').closest('tr').find('td').eq(4).html().replace(/<\/?a(.*?)>/gi, '') works as well.. :)  Thanks guys.  I knew I could count on you. :D
[10:28:40] <Jattenalle> simpleuser, <a href="javascript:void(0);"
[10:28:41] <decx> remove the href
[10:28:50] <Jattenalle> or what decx said
[10:28:53] <decx> na, just remove the href don't put js inline :>
[10:29:11] <Jattenalle> im just too used to shit browsers who can't handly anything at all :P
[10:29:19] <simpleuser> Jattenalle, decx : removing the href is valid for w3c?
[10:29:24] <Jattenalle> "No href? Well let's just crash the entire page then."
[10:29:31] <decx> hehe
[10:29:42] <Jattenalle> simpleuser, if it doesnt work, just do what i say with the inline javascript
[10:29:47] <decx> remember <a name="myanchor"> ?
[10:29:47] <simpleuser> ok thanks
[10:29:58] <decx> a never needed href ^^
[10:30:05] <Hilton> simpleuser: $('body').on('click', '#mylink', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* prevents default action of clicking link from happening. */ });
[10:30:17] <Jattenalle> decx, oh i know :P too bad some browsers didnt :P
[10:30:39] <decx> Hilton don't use body to liberally as a context
[10:31:00] <decx> too
[10:31:12] <Hilton> decx: Last thing I read said that that was now the preferred way to assign event handlers in the newest jQuery?
[10:31:43] <decx> yeah but always cook it down to the last not dynamically created parent
[10:31:50] <decx> $('#myparent').on
[10:32:16] <Hilton> decx: And if I'm assigning an event to elements that are littered all over the page? #container is just as big as body.
[10:32:48] <decx> the gains will be negligible
[10:32:54] <decx> damn thats a hard word
[10:34:04] <simpleuser> Hilton, don't understand. What does your code do?
[10:35:01] <Hilton> simpleuser: I was demonstrating that your event handler, which is what you should be using (not inline javascript), can start with e.preventDefault() to prevent the default action of clicking the link.
[10:36:10] <simpleuser> Hilton, oh ok thanks :)
[10:36:41] <m313> Hi
[10:39:09] <Technical_13> Can someone point me to the documentation for "return"?  I want to pass in three pieces of information to a function and have the function return two pieces when called.  Not sure how to do it.
[10:39:35] <Hilton> Technical_13: The only way to do that would be to return an array/object.
[10:39:43] <Hilton> That's basic Javascript.
[10:39:45] <Technical_13> That's what I was thinking.  Thanks.
[10:40:44] <Technical_13> I'll have to do it as an object because I want named keys and JavaScript arrays don't do that (like PHP associative arrays do).
[10:42:35] <Jattenalle> Technical_13, return {thing, stuff, meh: blah}
[10:43:53] <Technical_13> It will actually be: return {active: (true|false), showText: "string to alert to the user."};
[10:43:56] <Technical_13> but, yeah. ;)
[10:44:15] <Jattenalle> dont lie! thing, stuff, meh: blah is all the return you'll ever need! ;)
[10:44:40] <Technical_13> !cookie Jattenalle

[11:27:33] <tona> hello guys , have ever someone use sublime for jquery i watch one video , but when i typed <scritpt i saw it was completed , maybe i need to configure but i dont know whwre to start
[11:29:15] <Tomashe> Hey guys i got an ajax call, inside it i got a function that InitMap() , the problem is that map can only be loaded after the entire DOM is ready
[11:29:35] <Tomashe> so i wonder , should i put inside my .done of the ajax something like that
[11:29:43] <Tomashe> $("body").on("load",function() {InitMap();});
[11:29:47] <Tomashe> will it work ? or there is other wya
[11:36:44] <djcomidi> is there a way to make ajax calls only available for logged in users ?
[11:39:43] <systemfault> djcomidi: Some logic on the backend..
[11:39:51] <systemfault> The backend decides, not the frontend.
[11:49:41] <djcomidi> systemdefault thx for the answer

[12:01:09] <Manova> I want to make a sitemap kinda thing with unordered lists and lists etc. Is there anything jquery offers if I want to make these lists foldable?
[12:01:45] <systemfault> Manova: No, so look at jquery-ui or other plugins
[12:01:59] <Manova> systemfault: Okay, thanks
[12:01:59] <systemfault> jQuery is only a BOM/DOM abstraction layer with some utilities.

[12:25:35] <rnissl> Hi, in a dynamically created iframe, how do I add jquery support, so that the iframe content may call $.post()?
[12:30:06] <sess> same as in a normal page
[12:31:10] <the8thbit> If I want the equivalent of a POST request with action='/login', what arguments do I supply to .onsubmit()?
[12:32:08] <rnissl> sess, you mean <script src='jquery ...'>?
[12:32:42] <Woet> the8thbit: define "equivalent of a POST request".
[12:32:58] <sess> rnissl: yes
[12:33:11] <sess> you can think of an iframe as a complete standalone page render
[12:34:18] <rnissl> sess, actually, I don't want to get that iframe rendered, I just need it to get a different referer for $.post()
[12:35:15] <sess> regardless of of it's display: none or not
[12:43:22] <Hilton> If I have something like <input data-tags="[Foo, Bar]">, I can then use .data('tags') anywhere in JS that I can use array data. But the same doesn't seem to work with objects - trying to use a new extension and want to put my config options in each element, but .init(...data('options')) doesn't work (should be equivalent to .init({opt1: foo; opt2: bar;})
[12:43:55] <Hilton> Is there a way to make this work, or am I doing something wrong?
[12:59:56] <farn5w0rth> if i have a json array that i want to display, how do i use an each method to display this information? ex: if i had obj.Title1[0].Name and it gives me some value, how do i get all the values in the array?
[13:07:29] <ankurk_> I think I finally figured my own issue. yayy!
[13:15:30] <araujo> hello, is there any way to get jquery.load show data immediately called after receiving a specific amount of data from the server?, maybe after some delimiter, like a new line?.. instead of waiting for the whole data to be available
[13:20:12] <Technical_13> Where can I find a jQuery function that will let me display a prompt dialog with "Yes/No" buttons instead of "OK/Cancel"?
[13:20:38] <Technical_13> or an assimilation there of.
[13:20:59] <decx> and modal will do
[13:21:01] <decx> any*
[13:21:17] <decx> you can't change the text on confirm boxes afaik
[13:23:27] <Technical_13> I'll just use prompt() for now and I'll build my own box later using a library available on wikipedia... ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-morebits.js )

[13:33:29] <c4pr1> hi, looking for a developer to install a "parallax effect" on my website - paid job
[13:40:10] <TheGallery> damsceno it says on the documentation that you can disable days by returned "disabled" on the onRender event.
[13:40:29] <TheGallery> There is even an example with the checkin days
[13:41:41] <damasceno> TheGallery: I'm going to take a look. thank you.
[13:49:55] <onenine90> what are the best tools for testing cross browser compatibility - not just design, but front-end functionality too, such as jquery implementation ?

[14:30:38] <ronaldsmazitis> when I put text in those div tags they don't move
[14:30:50] <ronaldsmazitis> so whats wrong with jquery there
[14:31:28] <ronaldsmazitis> effect of having 3 colors appearing isn't such usable thing to do, but I can't put text in style tag

[17:55:18] <Erryl> Because I do not see the arrow in my menu, but that's probably because the wrong url is given to the image. But I can't find the place where to put the correct image
[18:09:54] <Erryl> I tried to replace all images with my icon, but I probably missed some
[18:57:49] <xmath279> Hello, I have a website that works approximately like that: http://jsfiddle.net/Qzt7E/3/ and the search popup doesn't work after loading a page using Ajax (if I add the attribute data-ajax="false" to my links, it will work), so it seems like the DOM gets reloaded and so the ID of the search popup gets doubled which causes troubles to display it. However, I was wondering what is the correct way to do it, as I found a topic regarding that issue but all I
[18:57:49] <xmath279>  found is that it is not the way to do it, which I already know. My URLs are built this way: ?p=x&status=x&... and I include a file, inc/x.php which contains a $content variable which is then output to the data-role="content" div.

[21:07:15] <shalini1992> hi, need help, how do we read a file through j query? and store it in a variable...!
[21:09:16] <shalini1992> ??
[21:12:37] <shalini1992> any help guys?
[21:12:44] <jphase> shalini1992: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[21:14:26] <shalini1992> thank u :) will check n revert back
[21:19:04] <shalini1992> jphase: i have a text file i just need to read the data from that file n display the data on html page, all this in backend
[21:19:53] <jphase> shalini1992: it's much easier to use a server-side language for that imo. do you not have a scripting language for the back end of your site?
[21:20:45] <shalini1992> jphase: python
[21:21:55] <jphase> shalini1992: well you can use python to grab a file and spit out the contents of your file into a variable for sure.
[21:23:46] <thepro4ever> use SimpleDateFormat
[21:23:50] <thepro4ever> wrong channel
[21:24:57] <shalini1992> jphase: yeah but it is like i have a jquery date picker, and a text file having datelist, so i need the dates in the datelist file to b be highlighted in the datepicker
[21:26:38] <jphase> shalini1992: sure, you can spit out the contents of that file onto the page to be used by a js variable
[21:27:30] <shalini1992> jphase: dint get u, can u elaborate please..
[21:28:39] <jphase> well, read the file with python into a variable like "data" - http://hastebin.com/yurakuwugi.tex
[21:29:12] <jphase> then you can spit out the contents of that variable into a <script> tag on the page so you can set a js variable (this is just an example of using a server-side approach)
[21:29:59] <shalini1992> jphase: ok, thank you, will try and revert back :)
[21:32:10] <shalini1992> jphase: i have one more issue here
[21:34:08] <jphase> shalini1992: am I supposed to guess what that issue is or?
[21:35:25] <shalini1992> jphase: oh sorry, i went back to discussing this solution with my team
[21:36:15] <shalini1992> jphase: the issue is, in this solution i will have to read the file everytime i refresh the data,
[21:36:38] <jphase> correct
[21:36:54] <shalini1992> jphase: so it is like i need previous dates intact n only new dates to b read n appended to the variable
[21:37:13] <shalini1992> is it possible?
[21:38:13] <jphase> so you're using jquery ui datepicker, and you want to read like a daterange from a file for limiting what the user can select? Tell me what you're trying to do as explicitly as possile
[21:42:18] <shalini1992> jphase: umm ok,  what i have is a folder containing reports of various dates, with date as folder name so in a calender i need to highlight the dates whose reports are already generated.
[21:43:48] <shalini1992> jphase: so i store the names of folders, that is dates in a text file for making things easy, and read that text file in python as u suggest, to get the datelist.
[21:44:21] <jphase> well I'd just use python to get the directory names personally
[21:44:31] <jphase> no need to create the extra step of file I/O
[21:45:31] <jphase> but yeah, you can grab the directory names from os.path I think, then you can spit them out as like a JSON object or something
[21:45:35] <shalini1992> haan i understood that if i use python, but as i was using jquery so i was confused.
[21:46:53] <jphase> well jquery and js is a front end language, so you really should be passing that off to js/jquery from your server side language
[21:46:55] <shalini1992> ok, well for now the problem seems to be solved i will inform u about the progress, thanks a lot.. :) for suggesting to use python
[21:47:05] <jphase> sure thing
[21:47:33] <jphase> but yeah, I'd recommend using a JSON string to pass to jquery
[21:48:42] <jphase> shalini1992: look into these:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10149263/extract-a-part-of-the-filepath-a-directory-in-python#10149358   -    http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html
[21:52:12] <Zed7> Hey can someone please checkout my stackoverflow post, I cant get my ajax form post working properly
[21:52:13] <Zed7> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22133662/jquery-mobile-ajax-form-submission-insert-data-into-mysql-db
[21:52:58] <Zed7> I have been reading through other stackoverflow posts with similar problems but havent found a solution, I am pretty sure its something small that I am not seeing
[21:59:52] <jphase> Zed7: I don't think you'll have to json_decode $_POST, php will just have the variables available in $_POST from jquery serialized data
[22:00:27] <Zed7> jphase: Oh I see, I will try that, thanks
[22:11:29] <Zed7> jphase: This has got it partially working. The data is now getting through to the database. However, when I log the $_POST variable to the console, I still get two results. And there is one cell of data that is missing from the inserted data.
[22:11:38] <Zed7> Here is a screenshot, http://i.imgur.com/z9UfMW7.png
[22:11:58] <Zed7> I have also updated my stackoverflow post to match the new php code
[22:12:34] <jphase> Zed7: have you confirmed the variable is there and the column name is correct on the insert
[22:14:01] <Zed7> Better version of the screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/NCT7eKW.png
[22:14:14] <Zed7> jphase: I have but I will double check it
[22:17:03] <jphase> btw, mysql_query is going to be deprecated very shortly ;)
[22:17:30] <Zed7> Oh I see :P Should I change to use the PDO method?
[22:17:54] <jphase> PDO is excellent yes :)
[22:18:11] <Zed7> Ok I should do that :)
[22:18:36] <Zed7> jphase: I added console.log(data); in my jQuery code and here is a screenshot of my console: http://i.imgur.com/rFlbPKy.png
[22:19:04] <Zed7> All the data is there, its just getting through for some reason
[22:20:18] <jphase> hmm, do like a die($postalCode);  or  ChromePhp::log($postalCode);  right after you set it
[22:20:43] <jphase> and/or log the sql string itself and see if it looks malformed
[22:20:54] <Zed7> ok cool
[22:28:39] <Zed7> jphase: Here is the result: http://i.imgur.com/27mLrDG.png
[22:28:59] <Zed7> The postCode data is there when it gets sent from jQuery but not there when it gets to PHP
[22:29:19] <Zed7> ill try  ChromePhp::log($_POST['postalCode']);
[22:30:36] <jphase> yeah
[22:30:38] <Zed7> $_POST['postalCode'] is empty
[22:31:11] <jphase> is it empty or is the key not even set?
[22:31:38] <jphase> well either way, that doesn't make much sense to me hmm
[22:32:23] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:32:32] <jphase> I have no idea Zed7, that should be coming across just fine
[22:32:43] <jphase> hi :D
[22:32:56] <Zed7> jphase: Yea thats what I thought, doesnt make sense
[22:33:05] <Zed7> hi Junior :)
[23:12:40] <Zed7> jphase: I tried GET instead of POST and now it works. Does that make sense to you? I dont get it haha
[23:12:53] <jphase> lol, none at all
[23:14:09] <Cork> Zed7: you using any framework server side?
[23:15:11] <Zed7> jphase: Just standard php, its a PhoneGap jQuery mobile app running through the PhoneGap emulator (Ripple)
[23:15:35] <Cork> hmm might be a phonegap thing
[23:16:01] <Zed7> Oops meant to put Cork:
[23:16:23] <jphase> not sure why phonegap would discriminate against just one key in your $_POST array though
[23:16:34] <Zed7> Yea possibly, I did find an article that said this: JSONP only allows type: "GET" but you can remove it altogether.
[23:16:44] <Cork> ah
[23:16:49] <Cork> sure phonegap
[23:16:56] <Zed7> jphase: Yea thats exactly what I thought
[23:17:02] <Cork> you can't have anything bug crossdomain
[23:17:11] <Cork> and ajax can't do cross domain by default
[23:17:15] <Cork> so it uses <script>
[23:17:21] <Cork> (and script can only be get)
[23:17:29] <Cork> Zed7: can you control the server?
[23:17:39] <Zed7> Oh!! that makes a lot of sense now
[23:17:45] <Zed7> Cork: Yes I can
[23:17:50] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[23:17:52] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[23:18:02] <Cork> try allowing * server hosts
[23:18:07] <jphase> he is
[23:18:09] <Cork> and then set crossDomain: true
[23:18:13] <Cork> in ajax
[23:18:19] <Cork> and you SHOULD be able to do post
[23:18:35] <Zed7> oh I see :) I'll try that
[23:18:37] <Cork> also you need to handle OPTIONS server side
[23:18:51] <Cork> as the browser will send that to the server before it does the post
[23:19:04] <Cork> and if it doesn't get a response it will block it
[23:19:27] <Zed7> which OPTIONS sorry?

[23:28:58] <chrislabeard> is there a plugin to achieve this effect when scrolling the page? http://sputnikcreative.com
[23:29:15] <chrislabeard> It looks like it detects the window height, then as the user scrolls it reduces the height
[23:30:14] <jphase> chrislabeard: if you mean the top section there, that's called parallax
[23:30:30] <chrislabeard> jphase: ah okay, i wasn't sure the right term to use when searching around
[23:30:58] <jphase> there's a couple of plugins out there like "superscrollorama" lol, funny name I know, but a lot of developers do that by hand
[23:31:49] <user258467> Hi how do I remove a CSS rules like this #foo:hover?
[23:32:59] <systemfault> You edit your stylesheet.
[23:34:14] <user258467> systemfault, I mean how do I do it via jquery, I need to override this rule
[23:36:12] <systemfault> user258467: I can think of two ways, 1) Use the DOM api to remove the rule from the loaded stylesheet 2) Create a <style> tag with a rule to override it and append it to the head.
[23:36:37] <systemfault> 2) is probably easier... 1) might require workaround for older browsers, I'm not sure
[23:38:30] <user258467> systemfault, I think I will try thanks
