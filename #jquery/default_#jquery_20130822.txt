[00:00:11] <Cork> aagii: that mean you from js request your server, your server requests the target site
[00:00:32] <Cork> aagii: no it would expose content leak
[00:00:54] <aagii> Cork: else do you know how to get content value in iframe. i tried to get, but get a permission error
[00:01:07] <Cork> aagii: ex you could do $('#hidden').load('https://facebook.com') and get your account information
[00:01:26] <Cork> aagii: like i said, you can if it is from YOUR domain
[00:01:33] <Cork> else it's blocked for said reason
[00:02:00] <aagii> ok
[00:02:18] <Cork> aagii: and in your in this case i mean the same domain as the request comes from
[00:02:47] <aagii> ok thank you
[00:02:47] <Cork> (cors might allow other domains, but that means you need to have server config access on the target site)
[00:03:18] <xec_> it also requires prayer
[00:03:29] <Cork> and ignorance for ie
[00:03:46] <Cork> and some mobiles
[00:03:59] <Cork> (like older iphones)
[00:06:53] <_pingu> Cork: your wrote: offsetParent.prop('scrollTop'). but what is working is: offsetParent().prop('scrollTop')
[00:06:56] <xec_> praying is futile when dealing with IE
[00:07:13] <Cork> _pingu: ya, you added $('table') i didn't
[00:07:20] <xec_> not that prayer is ever anything but futile, really
[00:07:26] <Cork> _pingu: i also said what i meant offsetParent to be
[00:07:56] <Cork> _pingu: and offsetParent() wasn't my initial tactic
[00:08:38] <Cork> xec_: browsers is going nuts when it comes to ui is my experience
[00:08:57] <Cork> xec_: the rest of them is actually stabilizing nicely
[00:09:20] <_pingu> Cork: the div around my table has no attribute scrollTop. In the whole source there is no such attribute
[00:09:30] <Cork> ...
[00:09:36] <Cork> ?g mdn scrollTop
[00:09:37] <b-ot> Cork: element.scrollTop - Web API reference | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollTop
[00:09:53] <Cork> _pingu: don't pick parts of the solution and then complain it doens't work >_<
[00:10:27] <Cork> _pingu: prop has no direct connection with attributes
[00:10:45] <Cork> _pingu: prop is for properties
[00:10:52] <Cork> attr is for attributes
[00:11:26] <Cork> but yes, browser expose attributes as properties, and some of those are modified versions of the attribute
[00:14:00] <_pingu> Cork:  I already tried element.scrollLeft on the div around the table, on the table itself and the tbody. nothing worked.
[00:14:39] <Cork> _pingu: it's not just "the div around the table" it need to be the offset parent
[00:14:46] <Cork> the element that has the scrollbar
[00:16:51] <mdev> how can I prevent a <button type="submit" from submitting
[00:17:10] <mdev> I tried $( "#buttonid" ).click(function(e)
[00:17:13] <mdev> then
[00:17:14] <Cork> mdev: you want to cancel the submission in one case?
[00:17:18] <Cork> or what?
[00:17:19] <mdev> e.preventDefault;
[00:17:30] <Cork> if you donät want it to be a submit use type="button"
[00:17:34] <_pingu> Cork: also tried offset parent. I can see the scrollbar in the table, but i can't see a scrollbar definition in the html source
[00:17:34] <mdev> yes stop submission so I can handle with javascript instead
[00:17:51] <Cork> mdev: you would have to bind .submit on the form
[00:18:02] <Cork> if you want to use preventDefault
[00:18:19] <mdev> oh ok, yeah changing to button fixed it :)
[00:18:20] <Cork> _pingu: what definition are you talking about?
[00:18:24] <mdev> thanks a lot
[00:18:39] <Cork> mdev: though you are creating a broken form if you do that
[00:19:10] <Cork> mdev: what you should do is bind click on the button, set a value on the form; and handle the submission from that event
[00:19:24] <Cork> (on the form that is)
[00:19:42] <Cork> mdev: you will break quite a few features in browsers if you use click instead of submit
[00:19:43] <_pingu> Cork: something like n your example: style="overflow: scroll"
[00:20:11] <Cork> _pingu: well the offset parent could be the window element
[00:20:17] <Cork> _pingu: if you don't have a specific one
[00:21:31] <mdev> cork it's all good, i'm pulling the data i'm after and submitting via ajax
[00:21:49] <Cork> mdev: no it's not
[00:22:02] <Cork> mdev: what i mean is you SHOULD do that in the submit event
[00:22:05] <Cork> not a click event
[00:22:08] <_pingu> Cork: my offsetParent is a div with tabs. but the command does nothing. why should it? the scrollbar does not scroll the tabs. it scrolls only the table. header and body
[00:22:14] <mdev> how is it not? you click button, it handles click event grabs data from text boxes etc..., submits via ajax then closes window or whatever
[00:22:28] <mdev> submit event clears the windows data text boxes etc...
[00:22:32] <Cork> mdev: and ppl that don't click the button, but ex. hit enter instead?
[00:22:50] <Cork> mdev: or ppl that can't see so they use application to submit the form?
[00:22:51] <Cork> or...
[00:23:01] <Cork> mdev: the browser handles that
[00:23:41] <Cork> form field storage is another thing that would break
[00:23:57] <mdev> huh?
[00:24:02] <seutje> ?down github.com
[00:24:02] <b-ot> seutje: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ It's not just you! http://github.com is down! (ECONNREFUSED)
[00:24:10] <seutje> OMFG NOES
[00:24:13] <mdev> enter is not an issue because the submit button doesn't have focus, the text boxes do
[00:24:21] <mdev> so they have to click to submit
[00:24:36] <Cork> mdev: the normal action for a form is to submit it on enter
[00:24:40] <Cork> so yes it is an issue
[00:24:55] <Cork> mdev: this is exactly what i meant, you are breaking how forms work
[00:25:38] <faraway> seutje: ah that explains my problem ^^
[00:26:07] <seutje> guess I'll scroll reddit or something
[00:28:08] <Cork> seutje: that reminds me about an image that someone modified from http://xkcd.com/303/
[00:28:22] <Cork> where they replaces compiling with github.com :)
[00:28:22] <mdev> ok Cork i'll just do listen on form submit
[00:28:27] <seutje> yeah, think I know the one ur talking about ;P

[00:30:22] <Krisostoomus>  hi...anyone can help me get country names to http://private-carsale.com/ worldmap/index.html ?
[00:30:23] <Cork> seutje: the sad part is that git was made to explicitly not have these problem...
[00:31:10] <seutje> yeah, I can work on this one project, but I was supposed to fix stuff in this other project, but I have to pull it first
[00:31:16] <seutje> figure out who broke DEV
[00:31:23] <faraway> i need to pull -.-
[00:32:46] <faraway> ah its back
[00:38:11] <faraway> Krisostoomus: whats wrong with this code itself? i don't see any licnense limitations that would prevent you form using it?
[00:38:28] <Krisostoomus> :D
[00:38:53] <Krisostoomus> how can i get the countires
[00:38:55] <Krisostoomus> ?
[00:40:49] <faraway> Krisostoomus: i would say they are included in the given link: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Geo-Projections#wiki-orthographic the library the code is based on ?
[00:43:31] <Krisostoomus> i personally think that its a bunch of bullshit there
[00:44:05] <Krisostoomus> there aint no country names.
[00:49:17] <Krisostoomus> you are god damn right
[00:52:52] <Nebros> good morning. can anyone tell me why my scripts are always blocked in the ie? i have always to unblock them manually... :(
[00:53:01] <faraway> Krisostoomus: well the "bunch of bullshit" is the whole math for the perspective rendering ;) it's up to you what you display, for further details you should probably ask in the ##d3.js channel.
[00:55:21] <Krisostoomus> thanks
[01:01:47] <echosystm> i have a tr with a click handler and then a button inside it also with a click handler
[01:01:58] <echosystm> when i click the button, the tr handler gets called
[01:02:01] <echosystm> how can i stop that?
[01:03:12] <Cork> echosystm: event.stopPropagation()
[01:04:23] <echosystm> i dont think thats the issue
[01:04:31] <echosystm> the button handler doesnt actually get called
[01:08:47] <echosystm> the handler for the button is bound before the tr
[01:08:59] <echosystm> so it seems like only the tr handler actually gets called
[01:10:00] <faraway> echosystm: how have you bound them directly or delegated ?
[01:10:02] <Cork> echosystm: no doens't work like that
[01:10:31] <Cork> echosystm: the bubble order means the button will be called first
[01:10:38] <Cork> even if you use delegate it will respect that
[01:11:58] <echosystm> ok i worked out what is going wrong
[01:12:20] <echosystm> in rails, ajax events don't occur unless they bubble up to the document :S
[01:12:34] <echosystm> so my thing stopping propagation stops it from happening
[01:12:56] <faraway> Cork: well i ment this situation:  if you have $(document).on("click", "tr button", â€¦.)   and $("tr").on("click", â€¦.) where the button is called later then the on of the tr. Or did that change ?
[01:13:06] <echosystm> this is now a rails question i think!
[01:13:11] <echosystm> thanks for your help gentlemen
[01:13:17] <Cork> faraway: ah
[01:13:24] <Cork> faraway: ya, that would be a probelm
[01:13:27] <Cork> *problem
[01:13:35] <Cork> echosystm: check if event.target is the button
[01:13:52] <Cork> echosystm: or move the tr check to delegate too
[01:14:36] <echosystm> Cork: tr will never be the target?
[01:14:41] <echosystm> it will always be the td
[01:15:07] <mdev> $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize()); how do include another variable i want to pass along
[01:15:28] <Cork> echosystm: no it's either the button or td
[01:15:51] <Cork> echosystm: unless you have collspace then you can click between the td's to hit the tr

[01:22:44] <rved> Could someone show me an example of jQote2 with JSON and using templates in separate files?
[01:22:48] <rved> i can't get this to work
[01:22:53] <rved> nor find examples
[01:27:39] <Cork> rved: $.get('template', function(data) { $.jqote(data, ...) })
[01:28:02] <Cork> rved: where the problem comes from
[01:28:03] <rved> do i need an extra plug-in for this?
[01:28:09] <Cork> no
[01:28:13] <Cork> $.get is jquery
[01:28:14] <rved> :O
[01:28:34] <Cork> and as long as you get the templet string jqote doens't care where it comes from
[01:29:09] <rved> or is it: jqoteload?
[01:29:14] <rved> instead of jqote?
[01:29:19] <gonnarule> hi everyone
[01:30:48] <faraway> does anyone know if it is possible to send compressed data with the jQuery.post ? I already have a library that deflates, but somewhere either already at the compression part or while sending, something is going horribly wrong :D â€¦ i'm just wondering if someone has already seen a working code that is sending compressed data using jQuery.post.
[01:31:06] <Cork> rved: there might be a jqoteload command/plugin, though i've never used it
[01:31:49] <gonnarule> question here about visibility or something like that : http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/ Could you please try to clic the button and say me why I can't see the property just after setting it ?
[01:32:00] <Cork> faraway: if it's gziped and marked like that in the header; the browser will inflate the data on the fly
[01:32:59] <faraway> Cork: the other way round â€¦ i want to deflate the date before sending and inflate on the server :D
[01:33:17] <Cork> faraway: hmm
[01:33:22] <Cork> never tried that
[01:33:39] <Cork> not even sure what you can do in that situation
[01:34:07] <jlebrech> what is built in validation?
[01:34:07] <mduvall> would anybody find this useful? i made the medium editing toolbar reusable: https://github.com/mduvall/grande.js
[01:34:40] <rved> Cork: what am i doing wrong? http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/jqote2.html
[01:35:43] <rved> I'm trying to load http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/example.tpl
[01:35:56] <rved> and i load json
[01:36:10] <Nebros> can anyone tell me why my scripts are always blocked in the ie? i have to unblock them manually... :(
[01:36:29] <faraway> Cork: well it is just testing if there would be performance benefits when saving bandwidth if upstream is is low. e.g. mobile devices or rural areas.
[01:37:05] <faraway> Cork: just a proof of concept nothing more :D
[01:38:04] <Cork> gonnarule: cause you always overwrite it with the return from the handler == undefined http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/1/
[01:38:25] <Cork> faraway: ya, all i said it i don't know much about it
[01:38:43] <Cork> faraway: i THINK you can get the browser to compress the traffic, but far from sure
[01:39:37] <Cork> jlebrech: hard to say without the context, but i guess it might be the validation the browser provides for form fields

[01:40:09] <jlebrech> Cork: what does this guy mean? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2587806/jquery-validation-plugin-require-2-checkboxes
[01:40:16] <jlebrech> in the answer
[01:40:51] <Cork> jlebrech: built into jquery.validate i suspect
[01:41:29] <jlebrech> Cork: just not sure what to do with that object :)
[01:41:42] <jlebrech> Cork: can just use html5 min, max
[01:42:00] <Cork> html form validation ya
[01:42:39] <Cork> though if you are using jquery.validate you are prob better of sticking with it
[01:42:45] <Cork> for consistency sake
[01:45:24] <gonnarule> Cork : thanks, damn I've got problems with this kind of code...
[01:45:51] <Cork> gonnarule: i would update the watch function
[01:46:09] <Cork> gonnarule: make it take the response from the function and check if it is undefined or not
[01:46:41] <Cork> or remove the capture of the return value all together if you don't want it
[01:47:25] <gonnarule> Cork : as you can think it's not my code, obviously. I'm just trying to get familiar with this concept
[01:48:26] <Cork> gonnarule: warning though, that code won't run in all engines
[01:48:46] <Cork> getters and setters is will experimental
[01:49:04] <gonnarule> so only new navigators ?
[01:49:05] <Cork> well not experimental, but very new
[01:49:10] <Cork> ya
[01:49:24] <gonnarule> I'm not going to use it anyway in my code
[01:49:24] <Cork> i know v8 and sm has it
[01:49:34] <Cork> but i don't think any other engines has it right now
[01:49:43] <gonnarule> v8 and sm are ?
[01:49:56] <Cork> v8 == chrome/chromium
[01:50:21] <Cork> sm is SpiderMonkey == all mozilla/gecko based browsers
[01:50:48] <rved> Cork: what am i doing wrong? http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/jqote2.html
[01:52:11] <Cork> rved: wheres the template?
[01:52:22] <rved> sec, ill try something first
[02:02:18] <rved> Cork: I'm trying to load http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/example.tpl into http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/jqote2.html
[02:02:24] <rved> but i can't get it to work
[02:02:25] <rved> :s
[02:02:28] <rved> bit stuck atm
[02:04:20] <Cork> rved: [11:03:54.913] SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list @ http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/jqote2.html:53
[02:05:14] <Cork> rved: you run $.getJSON IN $.jqote(
[02:05:19] <Cork> that won't work...
[02:05:33] <Cork> especially as you have ; after the getJSON call
[02:07:51] <rved> hmm, so how do i load json using jqote?
[02:08:09] <Cork> rved: you don't load it useing jqote
[02:08:17] <rved> ok, in var above?
[02:08:19] <Cork> rved: you load it and then template it with jqote
[02:08:35] <Cork> so jquote should run in the callback from getjson
[02:08:42] <gonnarule> Cork : what was the meaning to return something in the setter btw ? I'm trying to change it a bit, and no returns works too..
[02:08:47] <Cork> but you need the template before that
[02:09:11] <Cork> gonnarule: it is so the handler can modify the new value as it is set
[02:10:42] <gonnarule> Cork : I don't get it, "where" is going to return of the setter method ? As a setter should have no return right ?
[02:11:55] <Cork> gonnarule: not sure what you mean
[02:12:10] <Cork> var a = something.value = 10;
[02:12:15] <Cork> is that what you mean?
[02:12:18] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/2/
[02:12:57] <gonnarule> I mean, in the setter from the prototype, first code was using : return newval = handler.call(...);
[02:13:05] <gonnarule> why returning the result ?
[02:13:38] <gonnarule> Cork : in this code I just removed the return, and everything is fine too...
[02:13:53] <rynkan> I got a couple of images layered on top of each other, together they form a complete room (kitchen with sink, cabinets etc), how would i go on makin each visible item clicabe?
[02:14:45] <Cork> gonnarule: it is alert("property : " + myObj.myProperty); return undefined for me
[02:14:49] <gonnarule> visible because nothing is upon them, or visible because display != none or visibility =/hidden ?
[02:15:45] <gonnarule> Cork : with this new code ? (w/o the return in the setter ?)
[02:15:59] <Cork> gonnarule: the new code
[02:16:02] <gonnarule> Cork : working to me, the alert("property : " + myObj.myProperty); return bar to me
[02:17:41] <Cork> gonnarule: when you click the link?
[02:18:15] <gonnarule> I load : property : ""; I click : listener says me the changes from "foo" to "bar". And I've got the alert with property : bar
[02:18:48] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/3/
[02:18:51] <Cork> well something broke for you cause it doesn't work here
[02:18:54] <gonnarule> (just changed the alert)
[02:19:19] <Cork> "after click property : undefined"
[02:19:24] <faraway> hmmm why is the `$( elem ).triggerHandler( "remove" );` that is added to `cleanData` by jquery-ui not part of jquery itself?
[02:19:50] <gonnarule> damn.. would it be because I removed the return newval = handler.call(...) ? I just called the handler instead and set newval = val;
[02:20:28] <Cork> gonnarule: nope
[02:20:35] <Cork> something else changed too...
[02:20:49] <gonnarule> damn it's working to me. I'm on chrome
[02:22:17] <Cork> hmm wonder if it is that the value gets gc'ed
[02:23:32] <gonnarule> there is a garbage collector in js ?
[02:24:38] <Cork> uh... opps
[02:24:46] <Krisostoomus>  hey guys... how can i make it so, that when i click on a country, the name is displayed? http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index.html. Maybe this can help http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index%20-%20 Copy.html
[02:26:12] <rved> Cork: i still don't totally get it: http://test.robvaneckdesign.nl/jqote2.html
[02:26:41] <Cork> gonnarule: yes
[02:26:50] <rved> i load the json, if success, i load the template (with cdata script) into a div.. then i try to run my code
[02:26:51] <rved> ...
[02:26:53] <Cork> gonnarule: and yes it is gc killing it this works http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/5/
[02:27:15] <Cork> gonnarule: if you remove the return in the callback (return val) it breaks
[02:28:01] <gonnarule> Cork : well I just tried and it doesnt... damn I'm lost
[02:28:04] <gonnarule> with your code
[02:28:08] <Cork> rved: ajax is async, you need to use there callbacks
[02:28:10] <rved> Cork; could you have  a look at my code? Quite a bit of code for a simple thing
[02:28:26] <Cork> rved: you can't do var data = $.ajax() and expect to get anything
[02:28:42] <gonnarule> Cork : which sounds normal as the setter now don't set newval with the return of the handler, so handler doesn't need anymore to return something
[02:28:46] <rved> huh? i don't understand, it is working
[02:28:50] <seutje> xcept a deferred
[02:29:09] <Cork> rved: line 30
[02:29:54] <rved> oops
[02:29:57] <rved> that was not so pretty
[02:30:03] <Cork> rved: and you don't need the script tags if you load it the way you are
[02:30:19] <rved> so, inside example.tpl?
[02:30:21] <Cork> though you do have two separate templates in there
[02:30:23] <Cork> ja
[02:30:24] <rved> remove script tags
[02:30:33] <Cork> no you have two templates so...
[02:30:49] <rved> but then how would you recognize the id "header_tmpl"
[02:30:54] <Cork> as long as the id's don't conflict i think that should work
[02:30:55] <rved> if you'd remove the script tags
[02:31:06] <Cork> rved: by using the template string?
[02:31:18] <Cork> the id is to load the string from a script tag
[02:31:45] <janthony> Does jquery mobile events needs to be wrapped in something? All of the events work perfect on a browser/safari, but if I try bookmarking my page to home screen and running the app that way, none of the events work.
[02:32:15] <janthony> My events look like this: $(document).on('submit','#submit-test',function(){ with a return false at the end, also tried preventDefault()
[02:32:44] <rved> Cork: hmm, it feels a bit complicated, like too much code for something simple as load json and render a certain template
[02:33:04] <Cork> rved: cause you choose to over complicate it...
[02:33:43] <Cork> rved: you fetch a partial with html parse the theml to then look for an element you justt parsed to load a string from that element
[02:33:50] <Cork> instead of just having the string and using it
[02:36:40] <okdamn> hi how can i disable a <form> from submit and then re-enable it?
[02:36:44] <janthony> I"m also using data-ajax="false" so my custom.js functions can take over. Any ideas?
[02:37:18] <Cork> okdamn: i think prop('disabled', true) works
[02:37:47] <okdamn> <form disabled="disabled"> ?
[02:37:55] <Cork> ya
[02:38:20] <Cork> if it doesn't you would have to check it in a submit handler and prevent it there
[02:39:08] <okdamn> understood thanks
[02:39:11] <okdamn> testing it out :P
[02:40:17] <rved> Cork: well docs of jQote2 don't explain clear to me how i can load json and use separate templates
[02:40:34] <rved> i do like the plug-in, but there aren't much examples
[02:42:44] <Cork> rved: not sure why you mix the concepts together all the time
[02:42:56] <rved> me neither
[02:42:58] <okdamn> is $().on('submit'); available?
[02:43:00] <Cork> rved: jqote only care about templating
[02:43:09] <okdamn> on('submit') i mean
[02:43:16] <Cork> rved: it can load a template from a few set of sources, it doens't care about anything else
[02:43:36] <Cork> rved: where and how you get the data is up to you
[02:43:52] <Cork> rved: but the template and the data has to be in the page one way or another
[02:44:11] <Cork> okdamn: what do you mean available?
[02:44:44] <okdamn> can i use on('submit')
[02:44:45] <okdamn> ?
[02:44:50] <Cork> yes
[02:46:25] <okdamn> thanks
[02:47:08] <le_gars> I, I have question about lightbox. We have one at our site and we are having problem with the fact that sometimes when we click on something that is supposed to open in a lightbox. If all js is not loaded it does not open in the lightbox.
[02:48:11] <gonnarule> hi again
[02:49:08] <espen_mn> If I find my class (which is .promoted.book.123456) like this, var className = '.'+$(this).prop('class').split(' ').join('.'); how can I "skip the "promoted", leaving me with ".book.123456" ?
[02:49:35] <Cork> espen_mn: why would you need to do what??
[02:50:16] <Cork> espen_mn: if you want to store extra data use something like data-book-id="" instead
[02:50:22] <dokma> I'd like to pass all get parameters of the current page into an ajax call
[02:50:30] <dokma> what is the simplest way to do this?
[02:50:44] <Cork> window.location.search
[02:50:50] <espen_mn> Cork: I have some duplicate content ( so I will hide "anotherclass.book.123456"
[02:52:06] <Cork> ... ook...
[02:52:08] <espen_mn> Cork: thanks, will google that
[02:52:16] <Cork> espen_mn: $(this).prop('class').split(' ').slice(1).join('.')
[02:52:31] <Cork> espen_mn: the window.location.search was for dokma
[02:52:52] <dokma> Cork, thanks
[02:53:05] <espen_mn> Cork: Thanks again (the data-book-id was a good (better, I think) idea
[02:53:19] <Cork> espen_mn: cleaner if nothing else
[02:54:12] <gonnarule> Cork : damn it, even now (switched to firefox) when I completely remove the handler call in the setter, I still have the alert from the handler function... I'm so lost (or jsfiddle is trying to annoy me)
[02:54:25] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/7/
[02:54:29] <okdamn> thanks a lot
[02:54:35] <okdamn> bye :)
[02:55:33] <Cork> gonnarule: are you talking about the alert from line 71?
[02:55:35] <gonnarule> Cork : it really looks like firefox and chrome don't have at all the same behavior with this chunk of code. Working great on chrome, and firefox still call handler (should not) and set property to undefined
[02:56:00] <Cork> gonnarule: works ok for me except for a few gc problems
[02:56:01] <gonnarule> Cork : no, I'm talking about the alert line 63, from the handler
[02:56:25] <gonnarule> which handler is now commented in the setter from the prototype
[02:56:55] <Cork> gonnarule: ya, cause the gc is kicking you :)
[02:57:03] <gonnarule> why ?
[02:58:13] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/UWspC/7/#&towtruck=eurvwu09Hg
[02:59:03] <Cork> gonnarule: not fully sure, i would have to dig around with it to figure out why the gc kills the values
[02:59:08] <Cork> and i don't have the timer right now
[02:59:40] <gonnarule> ok no problem. I just would like to be sure about 1 or 2 points : why returning something in the setter method ?
[02:59:46] <gonnarule> this one I don't get
[02:59:56] <gonnarule> line 25ish
[03:00:01] <Cork> gonnarule: not fully sure, the specs arn't very clear
[03:00:11] <gonnarule> it's a mather of specs ?
[03:00:19] <gonnarule> setter HAS to return the value setted ?
[03:00:26] <Cork> no it's a matter of me not finding out why :)
[03:00:56] <gonnarule> damn, I though you were something like omniscient
[03:01:06] <gonnarule> :)
[03:02:32] <espen_mn> Cork: works (beautifully), thanks
[03:03:02] <Cork> gonnarule: also you might want to have a look at proxies
[03:03:35] <Cork> they are basically meant to do what you are trying to simulate with definedProperty
[03:03:51] <Krisostoomus> Hello..
[03:04:01] <gonnarule> well both chrome and firefox are on no proxy
[03:04:18] <Krisostoomus> why is Afganistan not red? http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index.ht ml Please help...Its from there http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330 modified.
[03:04:27] <Cork> gonnarule: no i know firefox supports it, i've even played with it
[03:04:50] <dytrivedi> vaishali: ping

[03:06:35] * seutje waves like a retard
[03:06:46] <Cork> :)
[03:06:59] * dytrivedi waves back, more or less like the same
[03:07:05] <seutje> nex ttime I feel like doing a project in SVG, kill me
[03:07:30] * dytrivedi strangulates seutje with his bear hands
[03:07:41] <vaishali>  /join #css  /join ##javascript
[03:07:46] <seutje> totally uncalled for!
[03:07:51] <beachandbytes> what are you doing in svg?
[03:08:00] <beachandbytes> rarely use it except for d3
[03:08:19] <vaishali> join ##css
[03:08:29] <Cork> seutje: whats wrong with svg?
[03:08:32] <seutje> recreating a flash game
[03:08:48] <seutje> well, inline SVG to be exact
[03:08:58] <Cork> shouldn't really matter much
[03:09:01] <seutje> FF & IE garble the markup when calling innerHTML on the parent
[03:09:11] <seutje> unable to interpret the markup they give me
[03:09:21] <Cork> seutje: why are you using innerHTML on an svg element?
[03:09:33] <vaishali> #css
[03:09:37] <seutje> webkit can't handle patterns with duplicate IDs so much that it just asplodes them when deleting a clone
[03:09:40] <Cork> vaishali: what are you doing??
[03:09:42] <seutje> Cork: no, on the parent
[03:09:50] <seutje> so I pass it as a string to canvg
[03:09:59] <vaishali> i m learning js
[03:10:10] <seutje> but FF and IE tend to strip spaces in between attributes and shit
[03:10:12] <Krisostoomus> how to mark afganistan red, like in http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330 on http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index.html ?
[03:10:20] <seutje> IE even duplicated an attribute for some reason
[03:10:26] <Cork> vaishali: by constantly saying channel names in the channel?
[03:10:27] <vaishali> cork:and also doing some freelancing work
[03:10:37] <seutje> also, IE fails to render most of the gradients/patterns, rendering them in black
[03:10:53] <Cork> vaishali: i was refering to why you keep saying client commands in the channel
[03:11:13] <Cork> seutje: ya, ie is special... with svg
[03:11:24] <Cork> vml normally works better there to my experience
[03:12:09] <Cork> seutje: you could have a look at raphaël, it is a nice lib if you want vector compatibility in browsers
[03:12:10] <vaishali> cork:  i m trying to add in css channel:)
[03:12:38] <Cork> vaishali: so fiddle with the commands in the status window so you don't echo them in the channel everything you make a mistake
[03:13:45] <vaishali>  /join #css
[03:14:02] <vaishali> now got it
[03:14:14] <seutje> Cork: yeah, I know, I chose the wrong library
[03:14:33] <Krisostoomus> most guys in here need just to go into right rooms like css or smthn'
[03:14:50] <seutje> werid thing is, when I pass IE's SVG string to canvg, it renders the colors properly on the canvas
[03:14:54] <Cork> Krisostoomus: true
[03:15:05] <Krisostoomus> ;)
[03:15:11] <seutje> and the whole thing is meant as an avatar-creator tool that lets you save it as a profile picture
[03:15:28] <seutje> so that actually works, u just can't see the avatar ur creating untill you generate the image :P
[03:15:33] <Cork> Krisostoomus: but the cross talk in the different web related channels is quite sever
[03:15:59] <Krisostoomus> still ;)
[03:16:01] <seutje> tbh, there's  a few channels that are pretty worthless, css and php being a few
[03:16:39] <Cork> #css has it's moments, but ya often it's just rude
[03:16:47] <Cork> #php is pointless
[03:17:04] <Krisostoomus> nope, im a php programmer
[03:17:27] <Cork> i remembered asking a question for a problem i had a good while back
[03:17:49] <Cork> got back a ton of responses of how i used string wrong and should do this and that for += and ++
[03:17:53] <dytrivedi> php, now where have I heard this?
[03:18:09] <dytrivedi> DIDN'T WE AGREE IN DOING ALL THINGS JAVASCRIPT?
[03:18:14] <Cork> and after trying to please the requests in the dump i got no answer what so ever about the original question >_>
[03:18:37] <Cork> got kinda fed up with that channel after that
[03:19:35] <faraway> dytrivedi:  at least when moving to page with much ajax or websocket usage it should be time to move away from one process per connection ^^
[03:19:51] <dytrivedi> hahaha
[03:21:04] <dytrivedi> .seen temp01
[03:21:04] <b-ot> dytrivedi: I have never seen temp01.
[03:21:09] <dytrivedi> sigh
[03:21:16] <dytrivedi> those were truly the days
[03:21:36] <hazamonzo> hey folks. I have an issue. I have a bunch of objects that i want to "restructure" to pull out only certain bits of information. Here is a screenshot of the contetnts i need to pull from a certain object (there are many objects as you can see). http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/22/plasma-desktopRQ2397.png Im looking at the $.map function to do this
[03:22:10] <hazamonzo> each one of those objects is a datum in my example. And this is what i've come up with so far. datums.map(function(d) {return d.atoms.series.value +";" + d.atoms.category.value; }).join("|");
[03:22:36] <Cork> hazamonzo: no map will only return arrays
[03:22:37] <hazamonzo> looking at the datums object afterwards, it would seem that they still contain ALL the properties or the original datum (in the screenshot)
[03:23:02] <hazamonzo> when i expected only a string of values (marked in red in the screenshot)
[03:23:02] <Cork> hazamonzo: also $.grep sounds more like what you want
[03:23:12] <dytrivedi> TIL $.grep
[03:23:20] <dytrivedi> I should hang out here more often
[03:23:30] <Cork> ?api $.grep
[03:23:31] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[03:23:37] <Cork> ?api jQuery.grep
[03:23:38] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[03:23:47] <frosch> Hi!  How to remove a css class from a jQuery html string?  Could someone explain to me why my example isn't working? http://jsbin.com/Ubawino/1/edit
[03:24:56] <faraway> frosch: because you don't change the string but the dom structure created out of the string
[03:25:38] <dytrivedi> frosch: just try to do $('#peepoo').find('foo').removeClass('bar');
[03:26:05] <dytrivedi> and then get $('#peepoo').html()
[03:26:45] <frosch> faraway: ok, I think I understand :)
[03:26:50] <frosch> dytrivedi: thank you
[03:27:08] <Cork> frosch: basically, jquery doesn't modify the html strings
[03:27:21] <Cork> frosch: so if you have a string parse it with $() you need to keep the dom around
[03:27:55] <frosch> Cork: ok, thanks for clarifying that :)
[03:29:02] <hazamonzo> Cork: ... well. these datum is an array of objects. I was thinking i could look through each datum, get thre properties i need from each, concatonate the properties into a string for each datum array and return a list of arrays with this one value (the string inside)
[03:29:05] <hazamonzo> Something like that
[03:29:13] <hazamonzo> To be honest, im in way over my head here :)
[03:29:32] <Cork> hazamonzo: ya that should work
[03:29:45] <Cork> and ya you would want $.map for that
[03:30:12] <hazamonzo> Yeah i was reading about that. So doing something like this... datums.map(function(d) {return d.atoms.series.value +";" + d.atoms.category.value; }).join("|");
[03:30:18] <hazamonzo> isn't going to work?
[03:30:38] <Cork> should
[03:30:42] <hazamonzo> applying the map function to the original array and returning the string arrays back into the datums?
[03:31:48] <Cork> js> print([{value:1},{value:2},{value:3},{value:4},{value:5}], function(v) { return v.value; }).join('|'))
[03:31:55] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:32:14] <Cork> oh bah..
[03:32:22] <Cork> also forgot it doesn't have jquery :/
[03:32:28] <hazamonzo> Hehehe
[03:32:39] <Cork> hazamonzo: but ya it should work just fine
[03:32:59] <hazamonzo> ahhh well im getting somewhere... i sent that code above to a new variable... so var something = datums.map.......
[03:33:13] <Cork> hazamonzo: just remember it returns the value it doesn't modify the original variable
[03:33:13] <hazamonzo> before and after. http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/22/plasma-desktopYM2397.png
[03:33:27] <hazamonzo> Cork: Right, i think that is where i was going wrong
[03:33:28] <Cork> hazamonzo: btw please no images of code
[03:33:34] <hazamonzo> Sorry mate
[03:33:35] <dytrivedi> ?pastebin
[03:33:40] <dytrivedi> ?paste
[03:33:41] <b-ot> dytrivedi: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:33:51] * hazamonzo checks if he can pastebin from chrome debugger
[03:34:09] <hazamonzo> yeah im familiar with pastebin :) We run another coding channel down the way :D
[03:34:15] <Cork> hazamonzo: preferably make an example of the structure in jsfiddle.net and run it there
[03:34:26] <Cork> much simpler to help you fix the problem
[03:34:49] <hazamonzo> Cork: Totally agree
[03:35:15] <hazamonzo> I think i have something i can use now though! Thanks for the help!

[03:47:02] <Cork> the is the one i use and it's tested on most major phones
[03:47:26] <Cork> (meaning iphone, android, fennec, firefox os)
[03:48:13] <bigawuc> is firefox major at all?
[03:48:27] <Gluesticky> But you can still scroll the page using drag too right? If it's not dragging the draggable.
[03:48:51] <Cork> Gluesticky: it depends on if you click the draggable or not
[03:49:06] <Cork> Gluesticky: but no you can't drag the page through the draggable
[03:49:06] <sammich> gotta include that on my project
[03:49:44] <Cork> bigawuc: nope they arn't
[03:49:50] <sammich> does that plugin do the 'fastClick' for click events, or does that leave them as is?
[03:50:33] <Cork> sammich: it does some click emulation
[03:50:43] <bigawuc> Any major phone makers adopting it? I think they made their move too late, android already is a monster as far as linux mobile os
[03:51:10] <Cork> bigawuc: android isn't really a linux phone though
[03:51:16] <sammich> Cork: but does that eliminate the 400ms delay?
[03:51:23] <Cork> bigawuc: thither is firefox os though
[03:51:55] <bigawuc> hmm, I thought android was linux based, thus, bash when rooted
[03:52:00] <Cork> sammich: touch end triggers click if you haven't moved, if that is what you mean
[03:52:26] <bigawuc> but my unix mac has bash too and I have a half way decent bash on windows machine
[03:52:27] <Cork> bigawuc: well if you mean an environment running in a vm ontop on linux ya
[03:52:28] <sammich> I guess I'll have to give it a try to see what it does
[03:52:38] <Cork> bigawuc: but the platform is java not linux
[03:53:02] <sammich> Android is Linux, but their Apps are run on a Java-clone VM
[03:53:11] <Cork> much of android is java too
[03:53:34] <sammich> you can write C++ apps for Android but they're obviously much more work
[03:53:38] <bigawuc> I see, I have been studying web app development such as php then got into javascript,
[03:53:51] <Cork> sammich: sure most of fennec is
[03:54:01] <bigawuc> I may have to join the bandwagon and go mobile, responsive might not cut it
[03:54:23] <Cork> bigawuc: don't agree, mobile is mostly about lock in
[03:54:43] <sammich> I greatly dislike sites that are fully responsive from desktop to mobile
[03:54:44] <Cork> and html is one of the best ways out from that
[03:54:45] <bigawuc> lockin? im a noob
[03:55:13] <Cork> bigawuc: if you make an app it will always be for a specific platform
[03:55:18] <bigawuc> I find mobile apps unimpressive, but I was spoiled by years of pcgaming
[03:55:34] <Cork> even if you port it to another platform it will still won't be a native app
[03:55:37] <bigawuc> I need to get over it and make one of those cheesy apps
[03:55:52] <sammich> Cork: guess you're waiting for a webGL port of Infinity Blade 2 or Real Racing 3?
[03:55:57] <bigawuc> so its always a java vm and not native?
[03:56:07] <sammich> most apps on Android are Java
[03:56:08] <Cork> sammich: no i find games for phone totally silly
[03:56:22] <bigawuc> What is expected out of the webRTC stuff?
[03:56:22] <sammich> oh well
[03:56:35] <bigawuc> Is that an area to start working with?
[03:56:44] <Cork> bigawuc: webrtc is quite interesting actually
[03:56:45] <Gluesticky> Damn gpl :-(
[03:56:58] <sammich> who says you can't casually game and then play 'pc' games when you get home?
[03:57:04] <Cork> bigawuc: it's mainly to allow two client to talk to each other directly
[03:57:26] <Cork> bigawuc: and i think it's going to have quite big meaning on the web in a while
[03:57:53] <Cork> sammich: i meant i find most all phone games a waste of space
[03:58:07] <sammich> space?
[03:58:10] <sammich> like memory?
[03:58:16] <Cork> sammich: they don't even reach up to the point of causal
[03:58:24] <Cork> ya
[03:58:25] <Cork> storage
[03:58:37] <sammich> what exactly is your definition of casual?
[03:58:58] <sammich> isn't a game of bejewelled casual?
[03:59:11] <Cork> something a bit more giving the marble
[03:59:19] <bigawuc> Cork, I agree, But I don't really know how to go about getting out in front of the rush toward it
[03:59:48] <bigawuc> The problem is going to be bandwidth.
[03:59:55] <sammich> Cork: come again?
[04:00:10] <Cork> sammich: so basically my definition of casual is not the same as brain killing

[04:01:37] <sammich> still not sure what you're getting at
[04:02:09] <Cork> daslicht: cause the first occurance is at position 3
[04:02:15] <Cork> js> print("dfgdfgdafgdfgdfgfg".search("[removed]"))
[04:02:23] <b-ot> Cork: 0
[04:02:26] <Cork> js> print("fgdfgdafgdfgdfgfg".search("[d]"))
[04:02:35] <b-ot> Cork: 2
[04:03:07] <Cork> sammich: that i find almost all android games to be about as good as the worst flash games out there
[04:04:09] <sammich> well, I find Real Racing 3, if you're into driving, a pretty awesome game
[04:04:16] <sammich> albeit, I've stopped playing it
[04:05:22] <sammich> a lot of good TD games out there
[04:05:49] <Cork> sammich: well the biggest reason android games sucks is cause there is no way to have a decent input solution
[04:06:12] <daslicht> Cork: shount ist search for the String "[removed]" inside "fgdfgdafgdfgdfgfg" ?
[04:06:18] <Gluesticky> Can't beat a mouse and keyboard!
[04:06:20] <Cork> only way to get something semi decent is to hook up a ps controller
[04:06:24] <daslicht> why is therer a hit for teh d ?
[04:06:29] <Cork> daslicht: [] is for ranges
[04:06:40] <daslicht> ohh
[04:06:49] <Cork> daslicht: [] means a collectionm and then it searches for each letter in that one
[04:06:57] <daslicht> ahh that makes sense
[04:07:00] <Cork> js> print("fgdfgdafgdfgdfgfg".search("\\[removed\\]"))
[04:07:00] <daslicht> thanks !
[04:07:07] <b-ot> Cork: -1
[04:07:11] <daslicht> yeah
[04:07:14] <Cork> might be what you are looking for
[04:07:21] <daslicht> exactly !
[04:07:30] <daslicht> i dodnt knew that the [] are operators
[04:07:49] <sammich> Cork: well, racing games are pretty natural, you just tilt the device
[04:07:59] <Cork> daslicht: search expects regex
[04:08:29] <daslicht> thanks
[04:26:05] <tonph`> hey guys
[04:26:39] <tonph`> http://pastebin.com/index/R4J7p3i4 - i have also was having trouble on this
[04:26:53] <tonph`> still i m , can some one has any idea ?
[04:27:18] <Cork> tonph`: would help if you ask the question
[04:27:52] <tonph`> yeah, in that snippet, i want to retreive the button whc triggerred the submit.
[04:28:12] <Cork> tonph`: most browser don't provide that information sadly
[04:28:25] <tonph`> i have multiple submit button for a single form, i want the click of the button in jQuery :(
[04:28:34] <Cork> tonph`: simplest is to bind a click event on the different buttons and set for example a hidden field to what you clicked
[04:29:04] <Cork> but ya, that is an annoying limitation in form elements
[04:29:14] <tonph`> unfortunately - i want to handle with submit ... :(
[04:29:33] <Cork> tonph`: i didn't mean you should handle the submit from click
[04:29:42] <Cork> tonph`: just the tracking of what button was clicked
[04:30:11] <tonph`> i wan the data-info ie. apple .. etc on that submit
[04:30:46] <tonph`> so my prob is, i  m not able to find whc button triggered that
[04:30:51] <_pingu> http://pastebin.com/NSKFbs1X  the Initializer is called 2 times when the page is loaded. once for each part which is  periodically refreshed by ajax requests. each part is represented by the element var. each part fires the event FrameworkX.UPDATED_EVENT after its refreshed, so the table automatic scrolls to the position given by xOffset. That works fine, but i don't understand exactly why....
[04:30:53] <_pingu> ...how many  ajaxStart handlers  does the code create, and why  is  the correct xOffset used for each part?
[04:31:08] <Cork> tonph`: cause cross browser they don't provide that like i said
[04:31:20] <Cork> tonph`: so you need to store the information your self
[04:31:41] <tonph`> how can i do that, i tried $thisEvent.find('button[type="submit"]:focus') in the form submit handler
[04:31:57] <tonph`> but this is not working in chrome :(, FF and IE works
[04:32:02] <Cork> tonph`: read the responses
[04:32:08] <Cork> i've already told you three times...
[04:32:30] <Cork> cause chrome normally don't have focus on anything other then input elements
[04:33:15] <tonph`> cork : any pointer exmple, that ll be nice
[04:33:29] <Cork> tonph`: read the RESPONSES!!! T_T
[04:33:36] <Cork> i've already told you...
[04:33:37] <tonph`> ok .. :(
[04:33:43] <_pingu> Cork: thanks for your help some hours before. so I'am several steps further. :-)
[04:33:47] <seutje> u could try fetch the focussed element
[04:34:06] <seutje> but if they hit enter from a textfield, it'll reference that textfield
[04:34:12] <Cork> seutje: no cause you won't have it
[04:34:26] <seutje> oh, it's a <button>
[04:34:34] <Cork> seutje: chrome don't put focus on most elements
[04:38:34] <seutje> yeah, apparently :/
[04:38:37] <Changa> Cork: do you remember the solution you offered me yesterday ? [13:04] <Cork> Changa: var options = ['<option></option>', '<option></option>', '<option></option>', '<option></option>'], categories = { cat1: [0,1,2,5,7] }; - [13:04] <Cork> Changa: then just build a list of html tags from the categories and options and replace everything in subcat
[04:38:43] <Changa> Can you expand on this slightly if you can?
[04:39:03] <Cork> Changa: fairly simple put each option as html into an array
[04:39:24] <Cork> Changa: and then combine them and build what should be in the sub select at every given time
[04:39:57] <Changa> ok lets see if it will work
[04:40:15] <Cork> Changa: i fiddled with the same things many years ago, and found the same limitations
[04:40:21] <Cork> was pre chrome though
[04:40:36] <Cork> but gecko was the only one that handled option elements like real normal dom elements
[04:40:47] <Cork> every one else had big problems if you started messing with them
[04:40:54] <Changa> I see
[04:41:14] <Changa> I have noticed lots of chrome specific bugs in my code on this latest project
[04:41:28] <Cork> Changa: well webkit, but ya
[04:41:57] <Cork> Changa: apple has been known for caring more about new flashy things instead of fixing bugs
[04:42:01] <Cork> it's a bit sad
[04:42:01] <seutje> IE has the best implementation for input elements!
[04:42:11] <Cork> (and one of the reasons google went for blink)
[04:42:14] <Changa> apple?
[04:42:20] <seutje> they made webkit
[04:42:23] <Changa> ah
[04:42:24] <Changa> ok
[04:42:33] <Changa> and chrome is webkit
[04:42:41] <seutje> sorta kinda :P
[04:42:45] <seutje> it's all very murky atm
[04:42:45] <Cork> Changa: apple is the one controling the webkit repo
[04:42:59] <Cork> Changa: webkit is the engine rendering the html
[04:43:01] <seutje> with chropera and blink and all
[04:43:05] <Changa> ok
[04:43:24] <Cork> Changa: same as trident == ie, gecko == firefox
[04:43:28] <Cork> and presto was opera
[04:43:31] <_pingu> could anybodey help, please?
[04:43:56] <Changa> these confuse me, but its good to know now that I need to know
[04:44:05] <sharpy35> hey guys
[04:44:39] <sharpy35> does anybody know how to enable the file upload progress with that fileuploading module?
[04:44:39] <sharpy35> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki
[04:44:52] <Cork> _pingu: what is the question?
[04:45:07] <sharpy35> i've tested in every browser and it works fine except of IE7-9
[04:45:23] <sharpy35> the demo page is running well on EVERY browser
[04:46:10] <_pingu> Cork: http://pastebin.com/NSKFbs1X  the Initializer is called 2 times when the page is loaded. once for each part which is  periodically refreshed by ajax requests. each part is represented by the element var. each part fires the event FrameworkX.UPDATED_EVENT after its refreshed, so the table automatic scrolls to the position given by xOffset. That works fine, but i don't understand exactly...
[04:46:11] <_pingu> ...why. how many  ajaxStart handlers  does the code create, and why  is  the correct xOffset used for each part?
[04:47:39] <Cork> _pingu: try make a jsfiddle where the problem is visible, i don't really follow
[04:49:48] <_pingu> Cork: that would take to much time. but thanks so far.
[04:56:46] <_pingu> Cork: I think i understand it now. the script is called 2 times, so each xOffset is in a different scope. when a part fires FrameworkX.UPDATED_EVENT it takes the correct xOffset of the ajaxStart handler in it's scope.
[05:01:44] <Krisostoomus> why is rotate not working? http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index.html
[05:22:40] <RabSimpson> hi folks, has anyone here produced a content carousel similar to that found on http://www.bbc.co.uk/ using jquery? i've been hunting around trying to find some decent instructions on how to reproduce it but not having any luck. i'm specifically *NOT* looking for photo gallery slider scripts. any ideas?
[05:23:17] <RRR2> you can read it's code
[05:25:18] <RRR2> RabSimpson: I don't see the content carousel on http://www.bbc.co.uk/ anyway.
[05:26:59] <RabSimpson> RRR2: i've been trying to pick through the code (it's not jquery, it's their own library called 'glow') and it's a mess. you can't see a huge carousel just below the weather info? it has large blue navigation buttons on the sides. it doesn't scroll automatically.
[05:30:17] <RabSimpson> RRR2: i've been trying to pick through the code (it's not jquery, it's their own library called 'glow') and it's a mess. you can't see a huge carousel just below the weather info? it has large blue navigation buttons on the sides. it doesn't scroll automatically.
[05:30:28] <RabSimpson> (just in case you timed out before you saw my response)
[05:31:21] <RRR2> I did
[05:31:24] <RRR2> Lol
[05:31:25] <RRR2> I hate this connection sometimes
[05:32:04] <RRR2> RabSimpson: BBC in your language?
[05:32:13] <RRR2> RabSimpson: Explore the BBC?
[05:32:53] <RabSimpson> RRR2: do you see 3 black lines with 'most popular', 'what's on' and 'explore' underneath them?
[05:33:11] <xec_> I don't see anything below the weather info, but at the very top theres a "from bbc news" slider
[05:33:45] <RabSimpson> they must have functionality in there to change it based on geolocation
[05:33:57] <RabSimpson> i've copied the source
[05:34:10] <RabSimpson> here it is: http://www.devsb.co.uk/gcss/
[05:35:15] <RRR2> HTTP Auth required
[05:35:21] <RRR2> pls
[05:35:29] <RabSimpson> ah, sorry, hold on
[05:36:12] <RabSimpson> try now
[05:36:41] <RRR2> Wow, so it's like a proxy
[05:36:56] <RRR2> It indeed is different
[05:37:55] <RabSimpson> and the underlying source is a mess, but then it's no doubt dynamic
[05:38:18] <RRR2> So that huge caroussel is what you want to imitate right?
[05:38:22] <RabSimpson> yup
[05:40:00] <RRR2> Well, I suggest you ignore most of the JavaScript and copy the css functionality so it seems
[05:40:53] <RRR2> You can organize the panes just like they do, but personally, I haven't done this.
[05:43:44] <RRR2> I'd probably have a hard time figuring out at what speed should the divs slide.
[05:52:57] <soee> what would be the best way to get data-x attribute value ?
[06:25:07] <seutje> ugh, I always forget splice mutates -_-
[06:26:16] <Changa> Cork: ashamed to ask, http://jsfiddle.net/Yb6sk/ , I am stuck dealing with arrays.
[06:28:36] <Changa> or anyone else, please have a look
[06:30:51] <Changa> I am basically trying to store the options of the select in a 2d array for further use. (next step - by selecting the main category, I will be able to add them to the options depending on their "cat")
[06:38:43] <iaj> Is there an easy jquery-ish way to, well if I have a string, to cut that string short if the last letter is a '8'.. eg if its 'foobar8' make it 'foobar' ?
[06:42:05] <usc911> Hey guys, I need to hover over one div to change the color of another, this works fine but when you stop hovering the div stays that color. Is there any way i can amend my code to go back to the original color? https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/c46d5fe43f48fc74123d
[06:46:10] <usc911> all good worked it out
[06:50:13] <Changa> I'm trying to add select options in an array, code not working is here -> http://jsfiddle.net/Yb6sk/1/
[06:50:43] <Roots47> Is there a way to select a range? IE $('.post-selector:gt(0):lt(6)'); â€¦ problem is, I want the zero'th item as well, not just greater than zero
[06:55:29] <DieHardMan> Can anyone help me with this, http://pastebin.com/N7paj5xg, need a way to get the two attributes from current element.
[06:57:22] <Brodingo> DieHardMan wrap it in an anon function
[06:57:34] <DieHardMan> tried that
[06:57:40] <DieHardMan> didnt work
[06:59:01] <Brodingo> this didnt work? trueSize: function () { return [$(this).attr('data-width'),$(this).attr('data-height')]; }
[07:03:21] <DieHardMan> this works: "trueSize: [500,500]", but this does not "trueSize: function () { return [500,500]; }"
[07:05:55] <Changa> How do I get class attribute of a HTML object stored in an array?
[07:06:06] <c4ptnh00k> .each()
[07:06:16] <Changa> yeah but how to I target the class?
[07:06:21] <Brodingo> ?map
[07:06:27] <c4ptnh00k> map
[07:08:24] <callumacrae> Would $('#id') and $('div#id') take the same amount of time to run?
[07:08:37] <callumacrae> I'm not sure if the sizzle getElementById optimisation would still work
[07:09:30] <Brodingo> either way its fast
[07:09:38] <crazydiamond> Hi. Can I list binded events somehow using latest jQuery version?
[07:10:50] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: here is your google search result http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2008592/can-i-find-events-bound-on-an-element-with-jquery
[07:11:37] <c4ptnh00k> crazy diamond: so the answer is yes you can look up the events bount to an element.
[07:11:47] <WimLeers> How do you specify primary and secondary user actions for dialog buttons? http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation mentions this but does not show it.
[07:11:52] <c4ptnh00k> bound*
[07:12:04] <buzzedword> callumacrae: http://jsperf.com/sizzle-getelementbyid-test -- here's a test case.
[07:12:41] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, that don't works for me
[07:12:47] <buzzedword> ID only is orders of magnitude faster
[07:12:58] <callumacrae> Aha, that's extremely different
[07:13:09] <buzzedword> same result for the nested ID
[07:13:11] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: what doesn't work? you have to be more specific
[07:13:28] <NoiseEee> callumacrae: $('div#someID') is just pointless
[07:13:33] <callumacrae> I know it is
[07:13:36] <callumacrae> I'm reviewing someone elses work
[07:13:40] <crazydiamond> I have an element (anchor), and some action happens when I click on it
[07:13:51] <buzzedword> adding one more test for argument sake
[07:13:56] <NoiseEee> callumacrae: FAIL THEM HARSHLY
[07:14:04] <NoiseEee> LOTS OF RED PEN
[07:14:21] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, but when I try to figure out, what the handler is
[07:14:24] <callumacrae> It's a jQuery course which was published a few years ago
[07:14:38] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, using the way you told me, it says "undefined"
[07:15:01] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: put it in a jsfiddle and I will look at it
[07:15:20] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, ok
[07:16:04] <buzzedword> callumacrae: yeah, using nested find statements, you can see the slowdown even further
[07:16:23] <buzzedword> that's using the fastest selector... lets see the slowest one now!
[07:18:10] <buzzedword> cool. not adding any more tests to http://jsperf.com/sizzle-getelementbyid-test -- its up to date. callumacrae, bottom line-- anyone doing el#id, fire them with fire.
[07:18:14] <buzzedword> well.. just reprimand them.
[07:22:17] <mrHat> ok, so i'm sending a char to a java applet using js and that char happens to be a \n which crashes js with : unfinished literal... how can i fix this ?
[07:22:51] <c4ptnh00k> escape character
[07:23:08] <mrHat> ?
[07:23:26] <buzzedword>  /\n
[07:23:39] <buzzedword> wait
[07:23:41] <buzzedword> thats not right
[07:23:43] <c4ptnh00k> \\
[07:23:48] <buzzedword> ^^ danke
[07:23:50] <mrHat> this is what i have : var t = '<?php echo "\x1D\x6B".chr(69).chr($bytes).$data ?>';
[07:24:20] <mrHat> chr($bytes) will (at chr(10) for example) output a \n
[07:24:33] <mrHat> that brakes everything
[07:24:36] <c4ptnh00k> \ is an escape character. if you want to read string with a \ in it you have to type \\
[07:24:38] <mrHat> so i should escape this in php ?
[07:24:53] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/PrBgw/4/
[07:25:03] <mrHat> but the data will no longer be sane
[07:26:10] <c4ptnh00k> javascript does not support literals so this is the only way that I know
[07:26:12] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, btw, a bit other http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/JZe26/ seems to work
[07:26:44] <mrHat> i could do String.fromCharCode() in js.. but that would be nasty
[07:26:50] <mrHat> i like to keep things separated
[07:26:53] <Changa> How do I get class attribute of a HTML object stored in an array?
[07:27:06] <Changa> .map is giving me results I am not expecting
[07:27:26] <buzzedword> mrHat: switch your single quotes in JS to double quotes. that's literally the only thing i can think of offhand
[07:27:28] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamod: what is difference in both?
[07:27:49] <mrHat> buzzedword tried that
[07:27:59] <buzzedword> mrHat: then I'm out of ideas
[07:27:59] <mrHat> unfortunately i don't think i can do it
[07:28:22] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: http://jsfiddle.net/JZe26/1/
[07:28:52] <c4ptnh00k> mrhat: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2553738/does-javascript-have-literal-strings  confirms what I was saying
[07:29:41] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, thanks
[07:29:46] <mrHat> \x00 does not need escaping
[07:29:59] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: no problem
[07:30:40] <c4ptnh00k> \n in a newline character is this being debated? seriously?
[07:31:16] <c4ptnh00k> is*
[07:33:09] <crazydiamond> c4ptnh00k, btw, I cannot see that in my actual page either. But I think this is 'cause there "on" jQuery function if used. I guess it is, say, selector-based, not element-based. Correct or not?
[07:34:42] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: any event ie .click() is just shorthand for .on('click', function(){});
[07:35:48] <c4ptnh00k> this returns and object so once you have the object you would then need treat it as such
[07:35:56] <c4ptnh00k> and= an
[07:37:04] <c4ptnh00k> crazydiamond: in short an element is a selector
[07:41:15] <fuchstronaut> I have a clickevent on a select element, how do i trigger click for specific option elements inside that selectbox?
[07:43:09] <fuchstronaut> nvm
[07:43:11] <Changa> c4ptnh00k: I'm trying to use map here but - all I'm getting are numbers. I need the class of the object stored in optionz array - http://jsfiddle.net/Yb6sk/6/
[07:43:24] <Changa> and for some reason it doesnt fire up in fiddle
[07:49:06] <c4ptnh00k> Changa:1 sec
[07:49:36] <Changa> ok
[07:50:51] <c4ptnh00k> Changa:console says theres an error in your array accessing
[07:51:09] <c4ptnh00k> so method must be jacked up. im looking at it now
[07:51:25] <Changa> thanks c4ptnh00k
[07:51:31] <Changa> first time I'm using .map
[07:51:51] <c4ptnh00k> np
[07:51:55] <Changa> its giving me numbers I can't make sense out of
[07:52:57] <c4ptnh00k> in the console you are outputting the array which is a collection of object. you need to go further than that
[07:53:21] <Changa> how?
[07:53:26] <Changa> what is a collection of object?
[07:53:41] <Changa> I just want to find the class of the object thats it
[07:54:04] <RohanBhangui> this is probably not a jquery question: but does anyone know how to trigger the backspace key when I click, for example, a button? I need it for codemirror editor
[07:54:27] <RohanBhangui> or even for that matter on demand
[07:55:51] <c4ptnh00k> rohanbhangui: keycode for space is 32
[07:56:14] <RohanBhangui> c4ptnh00k: ?
[07:57:02] <Changa> c4ptnh00k: with map, it will return to me each array index with contents listed as array?
[07:57:02] <AdamPDotty> keys are usually outside the browser
[07:57:05] <c4ptnh00k> changa: well you create optionz[$(this).val()] = $(this); this creates an array of all your options and each property therfore making it an object or a collection for your case you could use the 'option' selector and do a find for a class
[07:58:06] <c4ptnh00k> AdamPDotty: they are actually outside of the computer but you can still isten for them. You just have to have a good ear :P
[07:58:32] <RohanBhangui> AdamPDotty: so there is no real way of doing this? If not, is there any other way yu would suggest of doing this programmatically (i need more that just textarea.val().length-1)
[07:59:50] <AdamPDotty> You did not really tell us, what you want to do.
[08:00:13] <RohanBhangui> well
[08:00:42] <c4ptnh00k> changa: actually before I get to far into this what do you need it to DO like end result. there may be a different way
[08:01:10] <RohanBhangui> what i need to do is if i ress a button for example (or on demand for that matter) i need to be able to backspace(or delete) either the character just before caret or if a selection is made delete the selection
[08:01:53] <RohanBhangui> *press
[08:02:55] <tribbo> hi, I've got a beginner's question, I've got trouble calling a function via setInterval. it works once upon loading the page, but I've got a mistake somewhere with my setInterval line? http://pastebin.com/Q4CXk33f
[08:02:57] <Changa> c4ptnh00k - script gets all the subcategory options, stores them in an array - when user selects a main category - function checks the array, finds the subcategory objects with same class as category id selected by the user - inserts them as options to the select
[08:03:36] <c4ptnh00k> Changa: thanks
[08:04:14] <stijnherreman> scott_gonzalez: Regarding #9508, I'm not able to put this in a fiddle, but if I push to a global array instead of logging to the console, and then observe that array, it's filled with "September 1st". So this is no longer a console issue.
[08:05:40] <c4ptnh00k> rohanbhangui: $('#tbpass').keypress(function (e) {var enterKey = 13; if (e.which == enterKey)  $(this).closest("form").submit(); }); this is an example of listening to the enter key and handeling the event. backspace is keycode 8 so just modify as needed
[08:06:17] <Changa> c4ptnh00k be right back after a cig
[08:06:28] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[08:07:21] <fuchstronaut> Do i have to wait somehow for prependTo to prepend the element???
[08:07:32] <barad> hi im trying to use jquery validation plugin (http://jqueryvalidation.org/) and i dont know what is wrong here http://pastebin.com/yxMxLBMt the valid function always returns true. using jquery 1.9.1 (already tried with 1.9.0)
[08:07:57] <RohanBhangui> c4ptnh00k: the reason i need to be able to trigger on demand is that I need to be able to record the action and then sue the action at a later time (kind of like a play back)
[08:08:16] <dopie> is there a way for me to have a link and when the user clicks on a link it gets saved to his clipboard?
[08:08:40] <c4ptnh00k> RohanBhangui: but I just showed you how to listen to a keypress that is what you asked
[08:09:03] <RohanBhangui> but i need to trigger it ON DEMAND (i know about the keypress thing)
[08:09:17] <RohanBhangui> i need it for playback later
[08:10:50] <c4ptnh00k> what do you mean on demand? it's a listener. its always on demand
[08:11:49] <c4ptnh00k> if this is a keylogger then treat it as such with a string builder
[08:12:24] <krupnik> hi all
[08:12:53] <krupnik> I'm trying to repurpose some code from the peepcode ajax tut and not sure where I'm going wrong
[08:12:54] <krupnik> http://jsfiddle.net/krupnik/U6d4a/
[08:13:25] <krupnik> I keep getting Unexpected token ;  messages when I try to run this
[08:13:38] <krupnik> any help much appreciated
[08:13:53] <c4ptnh00k> use js hint
[08:13:59] <Changa> c4ptnh00k I'm back
[08:15:39] <krupnik> c4ptnh00k: jshint just telling me there's a missing semi-colon on line 22 - but there's one there.
[08:15:40] <c4ptnh00k> Changa: first fix is change var optionz = {}; to var optionz = [];

[08:17:18] <RohanBhangui> c4ptnh00k: thanks for your insight i will figure it out
[08:18:20] <c4ptnh00k> RohanBhangui: um ok if you feel like explaining yourself in more detail i could be of more help but your welcome anyways :P
[08:18:41] <tribbo> I got disconnected, I hope noone answered my question :)  // how can I call a function assigned to a variable via setInterval? the following is not working: http://pastebin.com/6Qfa0Tm3

[08:19:59] <krupnik> will try
[08:20:10] <BillCriswell> tribbo: jqxhr isn't a function.
[08:21:18] <c4ptnh00k> Changa: Im sorry man but i just dont see it. Having a rough morning apparently
[08:21:56] <BillCriswell> tribbo: You can do like... var jqxhr = function(){ return $.getJSON(); }; and you should be cool
[08:22:35] <tribbo> BillCriswell: thanks, that's what I thought I already had, I don't yet see the difference, I'll have a look
[08:23:08] <callumacrae> $("*").removeClass("highlight");
[08:23:09] <callumacrae> oh my god
[08:23:09] <Changa> Cork was the one who suggested this solution c4ptnh00k but he's not around today
[08:23:51] <BillCriswell> Where the hell as shoky been?
[08:24:16] <c4ptnh00k> Changa: it is a great way to do it, but not as familiar with .map() Bill probably knows
[08:24:31] <Changa> help me out BillCriswell :)
[08:24:34] <c4ptnh00k> dont you hear that bus bill?
[08:24:42] <RohanBhangui> BillCriswell: I bet he will be back soon
[08:24:53] <boytoy> BillCriswell: the idf prolly took him
[08:24:59] <boytoy> lulz
[08:25:49] <BillCriswell> He's hiding!
[08:25:55] <Fritz7> anyone used Handsontable ?
[08:26:30] <BillCriswell> Changa: What's your goal in this fiddle?
[08:26:57] <Changa> BillCriswell: script gets all the subcategory options, stores them in an array - when user selects a main category - function checks the array, finds the subcategory objects with same class as category id selected by the user - inserts them as options to the select
[08:32:42] <BillCriswell> Is there a reason you're approaching it this way with the subcats and a class?
[08:34:49] <Changa> BillCriswell when manipulating the list in chrome it messes up
[08:34:57] <Changa> Cork suggested this method to overcome the issues
[08:36:17] <BillCriswell> How were you attempting to manipulate it?
[08:38:03] <BillCriswell> Do you just want to repopulate it each time it's changed?
[08:39:02] <moxie_> I'm using jQuery 1.8.2 and am trying to send a cross-domain (I have a CORS policy in place) POST request via $.ajax but no matter what I doâ€¦ the request is going over as a GET and the OPTIONS preflight isn't even done.  Does anyone have any idea why this might be? I'm losing it.
[08:39:39] <Changa> BillCriswell
[08:39:57] <Changa> I was trying to do it via adding hidden class to hide and removing it to show
[08:40:04] <Changa> chrome didn't like that one
[08:40:19] <Changa> altho it worked in FF
[08:45:54] <BillCriswell> Changa: I found a dumb little plugin that makes it work in Chrome. http://jsfiddle.net/Yb6sk/9/
[08:46:48] <Changa> BillCriswell: stopped working after a couple changes?
[08:47:07] <BillCriswell> ha, it did
[08:47:10] <BillCriswell> what crap
[08:47:11] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:51:14] <Syrit> can any one please tell me, why $.get is not working, while $.ajax is working ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc1c830d0eba3da4895c
[08:53:01] <NoiseEee> Syrit: because they use different syntax. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[08:53:18] <NoiseEee> Syrit: personally i'm a fan of always using $.ajax
[08:53:50] <Syrit> i see, I tried providing the .get with only the url, and dataType, but it gives me a 400 badrequrest
[08:53:57] <Syrit> bad request*
[08:55:08] <ravenzz> ?getJSON @ Syrit
[08:55:13] <ravenzz> whatever
[08:55:28] <ravenzz> you can google it yourself
[08:55:57] <Syrit> sure i will, i am not her to be spoon fed :) only looking for keywords and some advice, and some thread tip :)
[08:56:35] <ravenzz> np
[08:56:44] <ravenzz> I was mad to the bot!
[08:57:05] <ravenzz> at*
[08:57:21] <Syrit> NoiseEee is a bot !?
[08:57:59] <ravenzz> no, well we use to have a bot here, but apparently is dead
[08:58:10] <BillCriswell> Changa: Ok, sorry about that haha. So many weird issues in that one but I ended up with this: http://jsfiddle.net/Yb6sk/10/
[08:58:21] <mdev> ravenzz make a new one, in node.js
[08:58:30] <mdev> make it fancy too
[08:58:37] <Syrit> oh i get one do you mean now ravenzz
[08:58:44] <BillCriswell> So help me if it's not fancy.
[08:58:57] <mdev> ^
[08:59:42] <ravenzz> mdev like colored and alternate caps
[09:00:48] <BillCriswell> I think some BBQ is calling my name.
[09:00:50] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone know how to do this correctly

[09:01:15] <maddog_> Hey, what's the alternative to ready() if I want to run a function regardless of a complete page refresh or an ajax reload?
[09:01:36] <BillCriswell> maddog_: You just don't put it in ready.
[09:01:48] <LoneSoldier728> ya u just include it
[09:01:51] <Changa> BillCriswell, thank you, this one works, care to explain me why? :)
[09:01:54] <LoneSoldier728> and it will run when it happens ol
[09:02:11] <LoneSoldier728> ready just makes sure the page is ready
[09:02:12] <BillCriswell> Changa: I am the Kenny Powers of coding. That's why.
[09:02:17] <LoneSoldier728> before it runs thats why it is there
[09:02:18] <Changa> \o/
[09:02:33] <Changa> BillCriswell can't thank you enough.
[09:02:47] <maddog_> BillCriswell: BillCriswell ok, so how would the code for that look like?
[09:02:47] <LoneSoldier728> and you arent looking for an alternative you are looking for something that does something different
[09:02:49] <BillCriswell> No problem! I'm looking at your old code to udnerstand why it wasn't
[09:02:57] <LoneSoldier728> an alternative would be the same job different way
[09:03:06] <maddog_> BillCriswell: sorry if that's a stupid question, but I'm not that familiar with js and jquery
[09:03:23] <LoneSoldier728> maddog_ it is just the code without the ready meatho
[09:03:24] <BillCriswell> maddog_: Whatever would have gone inside your .ready() business would just be out there.
[09:03:25] <LoneSoldier728> method
[09:03:45] <LoneSoldier728> if you show code maddog_
[09:03:48] <LoneSoldier728> we can help u better
[09:04:11] <BillCriswell> $(document).ready(function(){ $('el').addClass('foo'); }); would become $('el').addClass('foo');
[09:04:23] <LoneSoldier728> Bill do you know anything about facebook api
[09:04:26] <LoneSoldier728> or api in general?
[09:04:46] <maddog_> LoneSoldier728: This is my code: $(document).ready(function() {$('.comment').tooltip();});
[09:04:59] <LoneSoldier728> ya take out the $document.ready
[09:05:02] <LoneSoldier728> from around it
[09:05:06] <maddog_> BillCriswell: ok, let me try that
[09:05:11] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: I'm familiar with a few, but they can all be pretty different.
[09:05:19] <LoneSoldier728> so you should just have $('.comment').tooltip();
[09:05:31] <S3Xinfo> http://s3x.info/legs-up-full-view-of-beautiful-shaved-pussy-3/
[09:05:36] <BillCriswell> maddog_: If you put that code right before your </body> tag it'll be about the same as putting it in the head and using $(document).ready();
[09:05:58] <BillCriswell> I think that dude is in the wrong channel.
[09:06:12] <LoneSoldier728> Bill can you look at this and tell me if you can understand it hopefully : )
[09:06:14] <alainus> Has anyone got "undefined" in Autocomplete's request.item ?
[09:06:18] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18385515/retrieve-data-from-facebook-api-for-a-user
[09:07:39] <BillCriswell> Changa: I have no idea what's going on in the second part of this code.
[09:07:43] <maddog_> BillCriswell: ok, I see, so that's why it's currently not working. But as an alternative to putting it inside my body, is there a way to just delay the execution? 'Cause I'm using a sepparate file for my js and I'd like to keep it that way, if possible
[09:08:16] <Changa> what code BillCriswell?
[09:08:31] <BillCriswell> maddog_: Why do you want to delay the execution?
[09:08:50] <BillCriswell> The part with the each and the map inside it. Just not sure what the goal was there.
[09:09:44] <maddog_> BillCriswell: Because currently the scripts are at the top of my html file, which means the classes I wanna attach the functio to hasn't been loaded yet
[09:11:30] <BillCriswell> maddog_: If you have the scripts in your <head> and you're initializing them right before the </body> you're ok... If I'm understand right. Might be better to fiddle something up so I'm sure we're on the same page.
[09:11:38] <nhulea> Hi !
[09:12:18] <maddog_> BillCriswell: I'm not sure I can follow you. How would I initialize them?
[09:12:32] <awc737_> is there a reason .bind would work when .live does not?
[09:12:58] <BillCriswell> In your head say you have <script src="plugin1.js"></script><script src="plugin2.js"></script><script src="plugin3.js"></script>
[09:13:28] <maddog_> k
[09:13:38] <BillCriswell> You can start them $('.foo').plugin1();  $('.bar').plugin2();   $('.baz').plugin3(); right before the </body>.
[09:13:48] <awc737_> for some reason bind is working but live is not
[09:13:58] <awc737_> i thought live did everything bind does and more
[09:14:27] <maddog_> BillCriswell: ah ok, thanks for the explanation...since I'm on rails, I gotta find out the rails way of doing that. But I get the idead
[09:14:30] <maddog_> -d
[09:14:35] <maddog_> Thanks for your help guys :)
[09:14:43] <BillCriswell> Welcome

[09:17:57] <NoiseEee> don't need to update to use .on
[09:18:00] <NoiseEee> what version are you using?!
[09:18:07] <awc737_> don't have on in 1.6
[09:18:09] <rjcousineau> Hi, i'm looking to scroll a page to the bottom at a constant speed (not distance/time as the scroll speed changes based on how much content the page has), and then jump to the top and scroll again

[09:26:36] <per2> Hello all, trying to set up an alert whenever a session is about to expire and having trouble getting it to work. The following code will execute automatically whenever a request is sent, instead of waiting 10 second http://pastebin.com/dx2zjXbh
[09:27:48] <per2> any help would be greatly appreciated
[09:28:55] <NoiseEee> per2: drop the () in the setInterval call
[09:32:12] <per2> even when I type in setInterval(alert('session expired!'), 10000); - in my chrome browser - it still fires off instantly instead of waiting 10 secs
[09:32:34] <NoiseEee> per2: did you read what i just wrote?
[09:32:48] <NoiseEee> in both those cases, the function is invoked right away because of ()
[09:33:57] <NoiseEee> per2: setInterval(alertUserSessionExpired,10000);
[09:34:06] <per2> I see, I'm suppose to move the method call outside the setInterval method
[09:34:19] <NoiseEee> no, you just don't invoke the bloody thing right away with ()
[09:34:35] <NoiseEee> alternatively, setInterval(function() { //do something},10000);
[09:36:30] <per2> that worked, thanks for the help
[09:36:36] <per2> not sure why it worked
[09:36:47] <NoiseEee> read what i typed it explains why.
[09:37:07] <jop008> If I do $("#page").trigger('create'); my header title element is gone it is added by an html insert
[09:41:07] <per2> NoiseEee: is it because i'm assigning a function to a variable that it's able to delay the function call?
[09:45:46] <per2> found answer - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11403357/why-do-i-have-to-omit-parentheses-when-passing-a-function-as-an-argument
[09:46:04] <NoiseEee> per2: in both those cases, the function is invoked right away because of () and not a REFERENCE to the function
[09:48:51] <virgomoon> Good afternoon, all!  I have a jquery function that uses .load( <url> ) to replace the content of a <div> .. in that html it loads is an anchor tag <a data-role=button>..</a> but it doesn't get the 'jquerification' treatment (adding the requisite classes and such) so it just shows the <a>s as basic links.  How do you get that block of html to be passed through jquery to have all that added?
[10:05:11] <jop008> I have a problem with updating the title in the header I want to make a fiddle but it doesn't run see this http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/bxfhM/95/
[10:07:14] <cpierce> how do i get <option value="not this">I NEED THIS</option> from a select box with jquery
[10:07:23] <doug65536> jop008: isnull and getsession are not defined
[10:07:45] <doug65536> cpierce: .text()
[10:07:57] <cpierce> doug65536: it's returning all of them at once
[10:08:24] <prbc> It's better to use delegate instead of on?
[10:08:34] <doug65536> cpierce: oh, get just the selected thing's text?
[10:08:54] <cpierce> doug65536: yeap
[10:09:13] <jop008> I updated it but no run http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/bxfhM/96/
[10:10:04] <doug65536> cpierce: select.options[select.selectedIndex].text
[10:11:05] <doug65536> jop008: isnull is still being called
[10:11:27] <doug65536> jop008: why is a string being passed to isnull?
[10:12:36] <jop008> line 139 but there is no line 139
[10:17:34] <prbc> It's better to use delegate instead of on?
[10:18:55] <doug65536> prbc: delegate *is* on with different parameter order. delegate calls on
[10:19:33] <doug65536> prbc: all of those things (click/bind/delegate) are just wrappers around on
[10:19:59] <doug65536> prbc: no, on is better
[10:20:17] <LoneSoldier728> hey doug
[10:20:24] <doug65536> prbc: but I don't know exactly what you are saying. you can get bubbled events with on
[10:20:49] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: hey
[10:20:51] <LoneSoldier728> do you know how I can POST info received from facebook api
[10:20:56] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18385515/retrieve-data-from-facebook-api-for-a-user
[10:21:02] <LoneSoldier728> that is the SO question I posted
[10:21:09] <LoneSoldier728> I basically am receiving the info in a function
[10:21:59] <LoneSoldier728> so I was wondering how do I actually post it, do i just add fields and then call a js post
[10:22:17] <LoneSoldier728> the actual problem is that I cannot include jquery in jade
[10:22:35] <LoneSoldier728> so the function getFBData
[10:22:56] <LoneSoldier728> is returning data which is info, and now I want to post it instead of alert(data. etc...
[10:23:49] <jop008> I do this $("#title").html ("blablabla"); no error message but no blabla there is an id with title
[10:24:06] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: so the login works? and you want to send info to your server?
[10:24:43] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[10:24:49] <LoneSoldier728> basically I have the getFBData
[10:24:57] <prbc> doug65536: why on is better?
[10:24:58] <LoneSoldier728> function that gets data
[10:25:18] <LoneSoldier728> but now I am actually trying to throw that data somehow into a POST
[10:25:23] <doug65536> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/100/
[10:25:32] <prbc> doug65536: using on I have to bind events every time a load new content, delegate binds de wrapper tag
[10:25:46] <LoneSoldier728> I guess how do u post without jquery maybe that is what I need?
[10:25:51] <LoneSoldier728> and just throw it in the function
[10:26:31] <doug65536> prbc: actually, you are wrong about the difference between bind and on. all of those variations call on. bind is just 'on' with the second parameter null. you can use on to get events from a wrapper tag
[10:26:59] <doug65536> prbc: see the jquery source for on, bind, delegate, etc
[10:27:02] <doug65536> prbc: they all call on
[10:27:11] <doug65536> prbc: they are all 1 liners
[10:27:35] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $.post
[10:27:49] <prbc> doug65536: I wasn't talking about jquery.bind function
[10:28:15] <prbc> doug65536: I mean, I have to rebind elements in DOM, when new content is loaded
[10:28:17] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $.post('my_url.php', data, function(response, status, xhr) { ... completion handler })
[10:28:26] <doug65536> prbc: yes, use on
[10:28:56] <doug65536> prbc: you seem to have an idea that 'on' has to be bound directly to the controls. that's wrong
[10:29:01] <LoneSoldier728> ya does $.post work in jade hm if it does then i got it
[10:29:30] <doug65536> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/100/
[10:29:42] <wild_oscar> hi. I need to pass a variable to a function I'm defining. I'm doing it as such: jQuery.fn.extend({	    toggleAnswers: function (disable) {....} });
[10:30:20] <prbc> doug65536: I understand now! on can do the same thing as delegate
[10:30:36] <doug65536> prbc: yes
[10:30:48] <prbc> doug65536: but i think it wasn't like this before, right?
[10:31:14] <prbc> when live was not deprecated
[10:31:34] <doug65536> prbc: yes. those variations of on are just helper wrappers that actually call on for you with parameters set to some default or reordered
[10:31:37] <wild_oscar> what is the difference between passing variables like this or as options?
[10:32:00] <wild_oscar> eg: datepicker(){ format: yyyy-mm-dd}) ?
[10:32:10] <prbc> doug65536: nice, thanks! :D

[10:38:32] <awc737_> Do you think I can track a click on a Youtube video?
[10:38:58] <andrewho83> if you overlay something over the video yeah
[10:39:03] <andrewho83> but that's a little hacky
[10:39:09] <awc737_> hmm
[10:39:29] <awc737_> i'm supposed to track for analytics each time a video is played
[10:39:47] <andrewho83> how is the video being played
[10:39:51] <andrewho83> does the user have to click it ?
[10:39:57] <awc737_> yeah just youtube embeds

[10:42:53] <virgomoon> I have a jquery function that uses .load( <url> ) to replace the content of a <div> .. in that html it loads is an anchor tag <a data-role=button>..</a> but it doesn't get the 'jquerification' treatment (adding the requisite classes and such) so it just shows the <a>s as basic links.  How do you get that block of html to be passed through jquery to have all that added?
[10:44:01] <doug65536> virgomoon: you must be talking about jquery mobile, right?
[10:44:09] <virgomoon> yes
[10:44:29] <virgomoon> sorry, had my head buried in it so long I didn't think to mention that
[10:46:27] <doug65536> virgomoon: try $('#my_div').contents().each(function() { $(this).trigger('create'); });
[10:47:08] <virgomoon> in the .load callback I assume, right?
[10:47:13] <doug65536> virgomoon: yes
[10:48:20] <doug65536> virgomoon: I'm not sure if the .contents().each(  is necessary. you might want to also try $('#my_div').trigger('create')
[10:49:49] <virgomoon> no .. that didn't change anything
[10:49:51] <virgomoon> hmm
[10:50:02] <virgomoon> lemme try the shortened version
[10:51:04] <virgomoon> holy stink!
[10:51:05] <virgomoon> it worked
[10:51:22] <virgomoon> ok, now I gotta go figure out why :) thx, doug65536
[10:55:54] <doug65536> virgomoon: the contents each was probably too aggressive - it probably triggered a create on something that jqm doesn't like
[10:56:19] <doug65536> virgomoon: the short version works because it already does the children
[10:56:45] <virgomoon> ah, ok .. and if you do all of them it would, in theory, do them all multiple times since each walks down the tree?
[10:58:34] <virgomoon> I gotta run for a bit .. thanks for the help, doug65536
[10:59:32] <doug65536> virgomoon: yes it would probably to (n^2)/2 creates
[11:07:58] <doug65536> virgomoon: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/wPnrR/1/
[11:17:01] <virgomoon> whoa .. cool
[11:21:34] <brettfrable> hey yall
[11:22:47] <brettfrable> not really that skilled with jquery
[11:23:00] <brettfrable> but in short i have a json file storing data
[11:23:08] <brettfrable> and a form where the user types in a postal code
[11:23:33] <brettfrable> it is suppose to search that json file and return the result to console of the member who has that postal code
[11:23:36] <brettfrable> how would i do this
[11:23:42] <brettfrable> with a form input field
[11:24:52] <awc737_> if an iframe is within an <li>, why does a .on click method not fire if the iframe is clicked
[11:25:02] <awc737_> if I click just barely outside the iframe, in the <li>, it triggers
[11:25:05] <brettfrable> anyone
[11:25:11] <NoiseEee> awc737_: its a different document.
[11:25:16] <awc737_> darn
[11:25:34] <awc737_> i thought my li would behave like an overlay
[11:34:59] <raphie> is there a way to do "lazy" jQuery?
[11:35:04] <raphie> jQuery selectors, I mean
[11:35:33] <tw2113> lazy?
[11:35:38] <NoiseEee> what does that mean raphie
[11:35:47] <raphie> as in, only evaluating the selectors once they're used
[11:36:07] <doug65536> store it as a string, then put $() around it when you want to use it
[11:36:30] <raphie> doug65536: I guess that's a good point
[11:37:31] <raphie> is it possible to pass in a function instead?
[11:37:37] <raphie> a function that returns a jquery element
[11:41:51] <doug65536> raphie: call it yourself
[11:42:05] <doug65536> raphie: my_function().text("set some text")
[11:42:19] <doug65536> raphie: I don't see what that gains you
[11:44:05] <raphie> doug65536: I'm writing a framework for website tours. users specify elements using a selector. sometimes, however, the element won't exist before the tour starts, so using a function lets the element be fetched right when it's needed
[11:51:17] <sunbeam> hi, the Firebug cursor/pointer does not show up anymore. does anyone know how I can get it back?
[11:52:15] <doug65536> sunbeam: about:addons
[11:52:20] <doug65536> make sure it is enabled
[11:52:35] <doug65536> sunbeam: what cursor/pointer?
[11:52:38] <NoiseEee> o.O
[11:52:46] <sunbeam> doug65536: where you click elements on the page
[11:52:47] <sunbeam> with
[11:53:08] <sunbeam> doug65536:  just the default one that has always been there
[11:53:17] <sunbeam> left top of the firebug window
[11:54:10] <sunbeam> Its not there anymore
[11:54:13] <doug65536> sunbeam: I've never seen it not be there
[11:54:27] <sunbeam> doug65536: yea strange huh, cleared cache, reinstalled plugin
[11:54:50] <doug65536> sunbeam: try pulling down the bug menu and going options -> reset all options
[11:55:39] <doug65536> about:config will have TONS of things to look at (type firebug at the top)
[11:56:03] <sunbeam> doug65536: already did
[11:56:56] <sunbeam> and the close button on the right top is neither there
[11:57:28] <doug65536> sunbeam: in about:config look for extensions.firebug.hideDefaultInspector
[11:57:47] <doug65536> sunbeam: or just type inspect at the top of about:config
[11:58:37] <sunbeam> doug65536: its set as false
[11:58:53] <doug65536> sunbeam: in about:addons disable and reenable firebug
[11:59:03] <guester> i think i know the answer but if anyone wants to tell me how much of an idiot i am, i'll handle it. JQ moved to amd in source recently, am i right thinking this is only for internal uses? what i was hoping i could do is something like require(['jquery/core', 'jquery/selector'], function (jq, selector) {// do stuff using just the selector})
[12:00:05] <sunbeam> doug65536: did, same
[12:00:12] <sunbeam> :(
[12:00:24] <doug65536> sunbeam: lol. ok, read the comment I put on the questin here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3754604/how-to-get-firebug-to-break-on-exception
[12:02:09] <sunbeam> doug65536: stop sign = pause sign ?
[12:02:16] <sunbeam>  Click the little stop sign icon at the bottom until it is purple.
[12:03:10] <sunbeam> ok done
[12:03:37] <sunbeam> doug65536: and now
[12:03:50] <doug65536> sunbeam: go to elements tab and click magnifying glass at the bottom
[12:04:14] <sunbeam> elements tab on chrome?
[12:04:17] <doug65536> yes
[12:04:24] <sunbeam> done
[12:04:28] <doug65536> then mouse over stuff. click something to go to the html
[12:04:38] <sunbeam> done
[12:04:46] <doug65536> there's your element selector
[12:04:59] <sunbeam> I need this in firebug
[12:05:00] <sunbeam> in firefox
[12:05:03] <doug65536> why
[12:05:16] <sunbeam> because i like it better
[12:05:19] <doug65536> I hate to say it but firebug sucks
[12:05:47] <doug65536> how braindead is it for a debugger not to be able to break into the program at an exception?
[12:06:15] <sunbeam> how do you mean?
[12:06:41] <doug65536> your scripts will crash and firebug is oblivious
[12:07:06] <sunbeam> CTRL+Shift+C works btw
[12:07:11] <sunbeam> for firebug
[12:07:20] <doug65536> yeah? what does that do
[12:07:43] <doug65536> you can see for yourself that firebug is broken. where is the button? it's screwed up
[12:07:56] <sunbeam> Yep
[12:08:07] <sunbeam> but i'm more interested how suddenly it was broken :)
[12:08:24] <doug65536> chrome has an excellent debugger. you should learn to use it. it is far better than firebug
[12:08:50] <doug65536> I actually dislike chrome. it's not stable. but the debugger is so good I put up with that
[12:09:14] <sunbeam> hmm
[12:09:28] <doug65536> if firebug worked properly I would never touch chrome except cross browser tests
[12:10:29] <doug65536> you know that ridiculous list of source files (pull down menu) in firebug? if you go to sources tab, a *great* source code selector is there if you click the sources tab, then sources tab at the left
[12:10:52] <doug65536> if you don't see the "left" sources tab, click the little right arrow thing at top left
[12:11:10] <doug65536> in chrome
[12:11:41] <doug65536> it's a tree of domain/directories/files
[12:11:47] <sunbeam> OK
[12:12:37] <sunbeam> Lol
[12:12:37] <sunbeam> even the older Firebug versions have this
[12:12:37] <sunbeam> what can this be
[12:13:33] <sunbeam> installed a much older version
[12:13:35] <sunbeam> its gone :)
[12:13:48] <sunbeam> i mean it appears now
[12:14:44] <sunbeam> but now it doesnt do anything anhymore
[12:15:56] <Deas> how does one get cordinates of an image (x,y) and load it back up to show something like a pin
[12:16:15] <doug65536> Deas: load it back up?
[12:16:22] <Deas> eg, if u click on an image, ull place down a pin that shows for everyone that visits that site
[12:17:33] <doug65536> Deas: exactly how to position the pin depends on the page structure
[12:18:28] <Deas> doug65536: define 'page structure'
[12:18:50] <doug65536> whether the image is a child of a positioned div, whether the pin has the same parent as the image
[12:20:49] <Deas> ok so lets assume it's a full-screen image
[12:20:53] <Deas> nothing else on the page
[12:21:09] <doug65536> Deas: image is positon: fixed?
[12:21:20] <Deas> yes
[12:21:50] <doug65536> you do $('#my_pin').offset($('#my_img').offset())
[12:22:05] <sunbeam> doug65536: installed 1.10.6 now
[12:22:12] <sunbeam> doug65536: do you think this can cause any issues?
[12:22:24] <sunbeam> (1.10.6 inspector works btw)
[12:23:19] <doug65536> sunbeam: I wouldn't know, I gave up on firebug a while ago. any debugger that won't break into the code at uncaught exception is unusable for me
[12:24:27] <doug65536> sunbeam: if all it could do was freeze the program at an exception, that would be usable
[12:24:50] <sunbeam> i don't know, i've never needed this
[12:24:54] <sunbeam> in when cases do you need this/
[12:25:16] <doug65536> you've never had the browser abandon the rest of the script because you tried to access a member of undefined?
[12:25:37] <doug65536> browsers just drop the rest of the script at first uncaught exception
[12:25:46] <sunbeam> doug65536: ahh of course
[12:25:51] <sunbeam> I have webdeveloper toolbar for this
[12:26:08] <doug65536> yes, well chrome can pause the program for you automatically, without you doing anything like setting breakpints
[12:26:25] <NoiseEee> im pretty sure you can get firebug to do that as well
[12:26:40] <doug65536> NoiseEee: I'd like to see how
[12:27:04] <NoiseEee> break on all errors?
[12:27:15] <doug65536> NoiseEee: yeah? try it
[12:28:39] <doug65536> NoiseEee: it had no effect when I used it
[12:28:50] <NoiseEee> well thats silly :)
[12:29:06] <doug65536> NoiseEee: also, pull down the little menu thing in sources tab. it has "track try/catch". also no effect as far as I can tell
[12:29:07] <prbc> xit
[12:30:12] <NoiseEee> doug65536: just quickly tested it and it seemed to work for me
[12:30:21] <doug65536> firebug also kills performance - it disables native code generation when enabled
[12:30:32] <NoiseEee> "p is not definedÂ You can disable/enable break notifications in panel's tab menu." with the usual play/step/etc icons
[12:32:05] <doug65536> NoiseEee: where is break on all errors
[12:32:25] <NoiseEee> the pausebutton/stopsign in 'console' tab
[12:32:58] <Deas> doug65536: offset isnt exactly what i wanted; it needs to end up on where i am clicking, not just where the image starts
[12:34:07] <doug65536> Deas: you didn't expect it to magically know that you wanted it where you clicked right? you need to get the click coordinates in the click handler
[12:34:20] <doug65536> Deas: event.pageX and event.pageY
[12:34:37] <Deas> that's what i was asking for lol
[12:34:43] <lagrz> hello :)
[12:34:49] <doug65536> Deas: oh ok then :)
[12:35:47] <doug65536> Deas: there should also be offsetX and offsetY if you want coords relative to the object
[12:36:34] <lagrz> I have a question, when using the .append() method with an array for parameter do you guys know if jq automatically takes advantage of document fragments?
[12:44:06] <Deas> doug65536: and how would i obtain those variables?
[12:46:13] <doug65536> Deas: .on('click', function(PARAMETER_HERE) { PARAMETER_HERE.pageX; })
[12:46:21] <lagrz> Deas: i think that's built into the event obj
[12:47:04] <Deas> ah, pardon me for using .click(function() {
[12:47:05] <Blaster> hey I have a script that makes an AJAX call, and then on Success it populates a field with some data.   But for some people on some browsers, the Ajax response never gets returned (spinner icon just keeps spinning).  Any reason this might happen?
[12:47:26] <Blaster> This only occurs maybe one out of every 10 times for certain people on slower connections
[12:47:27] <doug65536> Deas: just make the handler take a parameter
[12:47:39] <msafi> Why is the entire jQuery library enclosed in (function(window,undefined) {})(window);?
[12:48:01] <doug65536> Deas: .click is a wrapper that calls .on, so it's common practice to just call on yourself
[12:48:15] <Deas> ah
[12:48:18] <Deas> i see.
[12:48:30] <doug65536> Deas: .click has to see if you're setting a handler or calling click, so it has more overhead too. small difference
[12:48:40] <doug65536> calling click()

[12:50:23] <shoky> wat?
[12:50:32] <msafi> Okay, I'll watch this hour long presentation...
[12:50:51] <msafi> Hopefully, it'll answer my question...
[12:51:32] <shoky> msafi: okok it's so inside the function they can be kinda sure that window is really the window object, and undefined is really undefined
[12:51:47] <doug65536> msafi: so the minifier can make a short name for undefined, to limit scope, and so they can use $ inside there when the user of jquery has disabled $
[12:51:59] <shoky> and also it creates a new local scope for everything inside so it doesn't pollute the global scope
[12:52:32] <doug65536> same thing for window, minifier can give it a short name
[12:53:00] <doug65536> sorry $ thing is unrelated thing that you do when making plugins
[12:53:35] <msafi> So how is it that jQuery and $ are visible outside of this local scope?
[12:53:59] <doug65536> msafi: they assign it to window.$ and window.jQuery
[12:54:10] <msafi> Ah, okay...
[12:54:11] <doug65536> msafi: window is the global scope
[12:54:34] <msafi> Thanks for the explanation shoky, doug65536!
[13:01:19] <Xander1> anyone familiar with blueimp jquery file upload - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - im trying to start upload on form submit
[13:01:28] <Xander1> working on a fiddle
[13:04:07] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: I'm using it
[13:04:13] <c4ptnh00k> unfortunately
[13:04:19] <quansai> Is there a way to load a div when I've clicked another div which when clicked, it unhides the parent of the div I want to show? So we have [ div parent [ child ] ] [ clickable div ]  When the clickable div is clicked, [ child ] is shown. I want to load [ child ] only when [ clickable div ] is clicked, as opposed to [ child ] loading at page load.
[13:05:21] <Xander1> @c4ptnh00k i have it set up so that it's part of a form
[13:08:51] <Xander1> @c4ptnh00k can i send you a jsfiddle to take a look at?
[13:09:57] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: yes
[13:13:15] <c4ptnh00k> quansai: is the div you are wanting to click a child of the hidden parrent?
[13:13:32] <quansai> c4ptnh00k: No.
[13:15:14] <Xander1> @c4ptnh00k http://jsfiddle.net/kxKJn/
[13:15:30] <c4ptnh00k> quansai:$('elem').on('click', function(){$('selector').show()});
[13:16:11] <Xander1> so i have a form that i want to add a functionatlity of attaching an image if user would like to
[13:16:34] <Xander1> so i have an input and a submit - and by themselves they work
[13:16:46] <c4ptnh00k> right
[13:16:58] <Xander1> tehn i added the blueimp jquery fileupload and it does create "preview" of the image
[13:17:09] <Xander1> but when i look at my $_POSTâ€¦image is not there
[13:17:23] <Xander1> only message field comes through
[13:18:01] <c4ptnh00k> so the way this plugin works is it uses a <input type="file" name="img" multiple> not a single file input like you have fiddled.
[13:18:27] <Xander1> multiple?
[13:18:42] <c4ptnh00k> yes a multiple file input

[13:24:06] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: that was just step one. At this point you should look at an example because you are going to have to hook into alot of things
[13:24:45] <Xander1> what do you mean ?
[13:24:45] <c4ptnh00k> brettfrable: for your problem we can just build the string
[13:25:01] <brettfrable> would you mind showing me
[13:25:02] <italianstallion> My first question is: If I just re-install jQuery (and possibly jQuery UI) as it is right now, will that bomb my site out or anything??
[13:25:13] <c4ptnh00k> brettfrable: yes doing it now
[13:25:13] <brettfrable> i know I'm 75% there
[13:26:06] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: gimme a sec
[13:26:35] <Xander1> Thank you
[13:29:35] <c4ptnh00k> brettfrable: also this wont work in fiddle because of ajax, but you knew that http://jsfiddle.net/9htP8/1/      give that a try
[13:30:27] <italianstallion> [~c4ptnh00k] can you help with this?
[13:30:50] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: gimme a few helping 2 others right now
[13:30:57] <italianstallion> k thanks
[13:31:35] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: what approach are you taking php, asp.net, angularJs?
[13:31:52] <Xander1> @c4ptnh00k php
[13:32:29] <Deas> lets say i have an grid, of 32px/32px; how would i snap that when using div.offset()
[13:32:43] <Deas> the grid is @ an img
[13:33:42] <c4ptnh00k> Xander: have you read this? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki#php
[13:34:03] <Xander1> yes
[13:34:11] <Xander1> i got it workign on one part of the app
[13:34:20] <Xander1> where its just a file upload
[13:34:29] <Xander1> and extra data transmits with it
[13:34:34] <c4ptnh00k> ok so what is breaking exactly
[13:34:53] <Xander1> files are not coming through to the $_POST
[13:35:44] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: you do not install jquery you merely reference to it. but im getting to your other questions in just a sec
[13:36:27] <c4ptnh00k> Xander1: are you getting any errors in your console?
[13:37:04] <Xander1> i followed that guide for https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data-and-save-to-database - on that other separate part - it works, user attaches image and then a field appear to create a custom title and pass it over
[13:37:12] <Xander1> no in my console, doesnt show any errors
[13:37:34] <Xander1> i looked at network and all variable go through, except file
[13:37:44] <c4ptnh00k> so the image data is passing but not the image?
[13:38:14] <Xander1> not even image data
[13:38:26] <Xander1> nothing about image(s) is coming through
[13:38:37] <NoiseEee> Xander1: you know that you can't send files via ajax/xhr right?
[13:38:42] <NoiseEee> Xander1: you can via XHR2
[13:38:53] <NoiseEee> Xander1: or using a hidden iframe
[13:39:06] <Xander1> but that will eliminate IE browsers, right?
[13:39:49] <c4ptnh00k> NoiseEee: I dont believe thats entirely true
[13:39:57] <italianstallion> @c4pth00k - thanks! The guy said "there are two instances of jquery library" and "you need to load a library in your template instead which can be used by any modules"; also said to "add a jquery library instance the the template file index.php".. basically I need to know now to do this..
[13:40:49] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: open the page that has it and delete the reference and then add it to your template page
[13:41:58] <italianstallion> I know how to find the template, edit it, all that jazz, just never worked with jQuery before, so a noob at this part.. using joomla php so modules everywhere as opposed to single html pages..
[13:42:39] <italianstallion> but the same advice should work if I find the slider module template and delete the reference and add it to the page template instead.. right?? lol
[13:42:42] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: try find in files because I have no idea where the previous guy put the references
[13:44:16] <italianstallion> and all it is a "<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>" line I add to the template?? seems to easy..
[13:45:06] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: If you just need to add the reference to the page that is all.
[13:46:14] <c4ptnh00k> you and also use jQuery.noConflict() if you are woried about other versions conflicting.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[13:46:46] <italianstallion> ok so once I've gotten this line in my template, and taken it out of the existing module, how do I "link" to it from that module and other modules I'll be installing??
[13:47:04] <italianstallion> or will they do that on their own??
[13:48:15] <jsbkkj> this is a long shot, but anyone know if there's a native OSX app for snippets / text expansion that lets you tab cycle through caret positions?
[13:48:33] <c4ptnh00k> when you referenced jquery it gets loaded first and anything in a <script> tag or an external js file will be run against the references
[13:48:36] <jsbkkj> tried all of them i swear, text expander, snippets etc
[13:48:53] <jsbkkj> ST2 lets you, but I want something global over the OS
[13:49:03] <NoiseEee> c4ptnh00k: its true
[13:49:08] <c4ptnh00k> jsbkkj: nope sorry
[13:49:19] <jsbkkj> text expander is the closest I can find
[13:49:21] <Deas> anyone point me to an ajax jquary with php+sql loading+saveing data example?
[13:49:23] <DarkGhost`> Hello everyone, http://privatepaste.com/2d694c3c84 I have this jquery plugin someone made, and it is called by $('#full-height-slider').pexetoSlideshow({}); I was wondering how to call the showNext() function inside that jquery plugin ?
[13:49:48] <jsbkkj> function( | ) { | }
[13:49:52] <InphraRed> hi
[13:49:54] <jsbkkj> i wanna tab cycle through the |'s
[13:50:10] <jsbkkj> I guess better start learning ObjC
[13:50:20] <c4ptnh00k> NoiseEee: i can send the data in a stream though through ajax
[13:50:47] <italianstallion> gotcha.. so basically I call the library in the template, that gets loaded first, and any modules or plugins will reference that template library call automatically..
[13:50:58] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[13:51:02] <Deas> can anyone point me to an ajax jquary with php+sql loading+saveing data example?
[13:51:03] <DarkGhost`> anybody? its a fairly simple question
[13:51:05] <InphraRed> I have an html document and some links, those links on click call jquery's '.load' function and targets a designated div.    Everything works fine, except if also have '.load' functions called within the HTML targets... they do not successfully load into their respective divs.
[13:51:15] <InphraRed> embedded .load() functions I suppose.
[13:53:11] <InphraRed> how do I get the embedded .load functions to actually work from .load(ed) functions.
[13:53:15] <DarkGhost`> Hello everyone, http://privatepaste.com/2d694c3c84 I have this jquery plugin someone made, and it is called by $('#full-height-slider').pexetoSlideshow({}); I was wondering how to call the showNext() function inside that jquery plugin ?
[13:53:21] <italianstallion> beauty.. thanks @c4pth00k !! I'll be back if I need that big brain of yours again :)
[13:54:25] <c4ptnh00k> italianstallion: lol im wrong most of the time, but your question was luckily easy enough for me to fumble through it :P
[13:54:49] <italianstallion> ha i'll try get some harder ones for ya ;)
[13:55:05] <InphraRed> italianstallion maybe he can help with mine :P
[13:55:54] <c4ptnh00k> InphraRed: honestly I just dont understand the problem at all. NoiseEee would be better help
[13:56:48] <InphraRed> $('.target-div').load('/newcontent.html');   within "newcontent.html" it also wants to use jquery .load functions.  but they will not work.
[13:57:27] <InphraRed> only the 'first' .load function will load content from the server into it's respecitve DOM target.
[13:58:56] <DarkGhost`> anybody here?
[13:59:31] <InphraRed> DarkGhost I'm here, just got here waiting for someone to address my problem.
[13:59:38] <Lui_> why
[13:59:47] <DarkGhost`> lol well mine is kind of a basic question just wondering how to do it
[13:59:56] <c4ptnh00k> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613287/making-successive-jquery-loads-in-nested-pages-work  this is the only thing i found
[14:01:12] <InphraRed> c4ptnh00k unfortuantely that has no solution or uggestion.
[14:01:20] <c4ptnh00k> exactly
[14:02:57] <c4ptnh00k> the .load should just wait untill that entire document has been loaded to the dom and then that ones .load should fire when needed. try triggereing them manually and see if its just the .load thats not fireing off
[14:03:22] <InphraRed> the loads fire off
[14:03:39] <InphraRed> the secondary ones fromwithin loaded content do not work.
[14:04:26] <InphraRed> I can tell they fire off becuase they have effect on the target divs.  FOrexample, I'll have default content within the target div and it'll be cleared.  but the "new" content will never be displayed within the embedded target div
[14:06:03] <c4ptnh00k> hmm. sorry dunno
[14:06:14] <c4ptnh00k> nothing to look at
[14:06:37] <InphraRed> it's ok
[14:06:55] <InphraRed> I'll just readjust my design for something that will work.
[14:07:23] <InphraRed> another problem I'm having is binding form submits from the loaded content as well.
[14:07:53] <InphraRed> firebug shows that the posts are being made, but the javascript to bind to the submits never get touched.
[14:09:25] <InphraRed> scratch that, I'm confused from my trial and error attempts.  with using jquery .post() function, the posts aren't made and the "submit" event is never intercepted.  I tried two or three different examples from google... none of them work from content rendered from .load().
[14:10:16] <red6m> I add multiple spinners on page. First one for some reason get's different styling then others.
[14:10:22] <red6m> any suggestions?
[14:10:58] <InphraRed> red6m the first one is inheriting CSS attributes from parent tags?
[14:15:19] <red6m> InphraRed, first spinner has these classes on buttons: "ui-spinner-button ui-spinner-up ui-corner-tr ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-button-text-only" and allof the consequent spinners only: "ui-spinner-button ui-spinner-up ui-corner-tr"
[14:15:46] <red6m> I'm srsly confused why that would happen...
[14:19:17] <crankharder> can I get to the api docs for an old version of jquery somewhere?
[14:23:13] <Deas> $.post() jquary example please, with the php
[14:23:23] <Deas> i dont think it's calling the php file :/
[14:23:28] <NoiseEee> i think they're just in the api docs? and listed as removed/deprecated @ crankharder   what particular method?
[14:37:26] <brettfrable> c4ptnh00k you still here
[14:37:36] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[14:38:30] <brettfrable> you know why this isn't working
[14:38:31] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/8dCRd/
[14:38:42] <brettfrable> as far as window.location
[14:38:46] <brettfrable> it's not going to the page
[14:45:52] <Deas> anyone know why fopen in php using $.post() can't open the file? :3
[14:46:23] <Deas> php file and textfile is in the same dir
[14:48:20] <pixelpimp> i bet it's the reason in the error message
[14:49:35] <c4ptnh00k> brettfrable: in fiddle it doesnt work because u did not reference jquery
[14:49:59] <brettfrable> no i mean in my local dev
[14:54:05] <c4ptnh00k> brettfrable: http://jsfiddle.net/8dCRd/4/
[14:54:11] <c4ptnh00k> see if that helps

[15:24:41] <brettfrable> please help
[15:25:35] <brettfrable> please
[15:28:05] <brettfrable> oksushi
[15:28:09] <brettfrable> you good with js
[15:41:10] <brettfrable> pixelpimp
[15:41:27] <brettfrable> so I'm doing something json
[15:41:32] <brettfrable> and console is logging it correctly
[15:41:43] <brettfrable> but this is taking me to an undefined url
[15:41:49] <brettfrable> instead of getting the actual path value
[15:41:53] <brettfrable> window.location.href = location.hostname + '/' + data.result.path;
[15:44:25] <raphie> how do I write a selector that matches the text contents of an element exactly? :contains('foo') matches <div>foo</div> but also <div>baz foo bar</div>, but I only want the first one
[15:44:40] <pixelpimp> what does the string you're passing it look like?  if you don't have a scheme (e.g. http://) it might interpret it as a relative path, no?
[15:45:12] <brettfrable> this is where I'm bring taken
[15:45:12] <brettfrable> http://liberal.local/liberal.local/undefined
[15:45:17] <brettfrable> string looks like so
[15:45:48] <pixelpimp> I think you can use a regexp there
[15:46:15] <brettfrable> Object {is_success: true, result: Array[1]}
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> is_success: true
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> result: Array[1]
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> 0: Object
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> electorate_member: "Canberra"
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> electorate_postal: "Canberra"
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> first_name: "Tom"
[15:46:16] <brettfrable> has_member: "1"
[15:46:17] <brettfrable> id: "954"
[15:46:17] <brettfrable> is_partner: "0"
[15:46:18] <brettfrable> last_name: "Sefton"
[15:46:18] <brettfrable> nid: "17944"
[15:46:19] <brettfrable> path: "member/tom-sefton"
[15:46:19] <brettfrable> postal: "2902"
[15:46:54] <brettfrable> what do you think?
[15:46:55] <pixelpimp> raphie: try :contains('^foo$')
[15:47:10] <raphie> pixelpimp: ooh, didn't know you could use a regex. thanks man
[15:47:16] <pixelpimp> i don't know that you can
[15:47:29] <pixelpimp> but ^ is supported in some places; that might be one
[15:48:01] <raphie> nope, you can't
[15:48:25] <brettfrable> ?
[15:55:39] <pixelpimp> raphie: looks like it'll take a filter like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15364298/make-jquerys-contains-select-only-exact-string
[15:56:50] <pixelpimp> brettfrable: so you need the http:// so it's not being interpreted as a relative URI.  but your data.result.path is undefined - probably you meant something like data.result[0].path
[15:58:02] <brettfrable> i need the http where
[16:00:19] <brettfrable> where can i put the http
[16:00:28] <pixelpimp> is that a real question? :/
[16:00:35] <pixelpimp> it goes at the beginning of the URI
[16:00:39] <brettfrable> right
[16:00:44] <brettfrable> but in the script
[16:00:53] <pixelpimp> at the beginning of the URI... :/
[16:01:05] <pixelpimp> the one you're setting as your .href
[16:01:29] <brettfrable> 			window.location.href = 'http://' + location.hostname + '/' + data.result[0].path;
[16:01:29] <brettfrable> 	
[16:01:31] <brettfrable> like that?
[16:01:47] <pixelpimp> yep
[16:02:10] <pixelpimp> unless it's not http, of course (i have no idea)
[16:02:14] <brettfrable> nope
[16:02:16] <brettfrable> doesnt work
[16:02:23] <pixelpimp> define "doesn't work"
[16:03:41] <jvost> I am trying to figure out ajax, and it looks like it's firing (I get an action timer), but then it finishes, and nothing happens. How would I use firefox to debug it?
[16:03:51] <brettfrable> window.location.href = 'http://' + window.location.hostname + '/' + data.result[0].path;
[16:03:54] <brettfrable> that works
[16:04:34] <brettfrable> so adding in the [0]
[16:04:36] <brettfrable> what was that
[16:05:04] <brettfrable> is that basically the array
[16:05:10] <brettfrable> of items
[16:05:27] <brettfrable> specifically what would that be calling
[16:05:30] <brettfrable> in a json file
[16:05:32] <brettfrable> so i understand
[16:17:55] <oste> is it possible to invoke code when an event is finished firing?
[16:19:24] <Deas> any1 know what permissions fopen (php) needs? c.c all im getting is "Permission denied" (using jQuaries "post" func ..)
[16:32:49] <brettfrable> helllo
[16:36:23] <Fritz7> hello has anyone used Handsontabl e?
[17:32:11] <veQue> hi
[17:32:56] <veQue> just a question, for someone that's smart. why is it that some .mp3 files ask that i open them with an app and others can play directly in my firefox window?
[17:43:01] <doug65536> veQue: probably the content type in the response headers
[17:43:50] <doug65536> veQue: can you show an example of both?
[17:44:46] <doug65536> veQue: if that isn't it, the ones that play in browser are probably html5 audio tags
[17:45:52] <veQue> yeh. let me find the links
[17:50:29] <veQue>  http://media.xlr8r.com/files/downloads/mp3s/Sterling%20Thrones.mp3 -will download to my hd // http://podcast.randomgeeks.com/show/Random-Geeks-11_Milk-and-Cereal.mp3  this one opens in firefox
[17:51:12] <doug65536> veQue: the one that plays in browser is an html5 audio tag
[17:51:38] <veQue> how does that work?
[17:51:54] <veQue> i'd prefer if they just played in firefox
[17:52:16] <veQue> no way to avoid the downloading?
[17:52:30] <doug65536> veQue: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
[17:52:48] <doug65536> veQue: why do you say no way to avoid? I just told you it's an HTML5 audio tag
[17:53:04] <veQue> oh
[17:53:20] <doug65536> veQue:  <audio src="url...">
[17:53:28] <veQue> i'm talking as a user. not a developer now
[17:53:32] <veQue> =)
[17:53:38] <doug65536> veQue: ok lol
[17:53:50] <veQue> thanks, great help
[17:53:53] <doug65536> veQue: it's a simple thing that you put in your html to put a player there
[17:56:15] <doug65536> veQue: I'll show you something that will let you do that
[17:56:16] <Mattx> Hi
[17:56:30] <Mattx> what's the most sane way to bind an event to show?
[17:56:49] <Mattx> I want to execute a unction whenever an element is visible/hidden
[17:57:00] <Mattx> function*
[17:58:08] <doug65536> Mattx: you can't
[17:58:17] <Mattx> of course you can
[17:58:21] <doug65536> Mattx: not cross browser anyway
[17:58:32] <Mattx> well, you can always pool :P
[17:58:36] <doug65536> Mattx: how do you know you can
[17:59:06] <Mattx> dogarrhea, in the worst case you can pool and check something every N ms
[17:59:13] <Mattx> poll **
[17:59:15] <doug65536> why would you poll
[17:59:31] <Mattx> I don't want to do so, that's why I'm asking if there's a better way
[17:59:52] <Mattx> I read there are some functions for some browsers, like watch() in mozilla
[18:00:01] <Mattx> but yeah, it seems it's not cross browser
[18:01:01] <doug65536> what is it you want to do
[18:01:24] <Mattx> I'm using foundation (I actually tried with bootstrap as well)
[18:01:35] <Mattx> and I want to call a function when the breakpoints are reached
[18:01:47] <Mattx> but it's not supported natively in these frameworks
[18:02:43] <Mattx> so I was going to bind an event to some of the elements that are hidden when the screen is resized
[18:04:02] <doug65536> veQue: here is a thing to try it out http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4dxgB/2/
[18:05:00] <doug65536> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4dxgB/3/
[18:05:30] <doug65536> Mattx: there are jquery plugins to give you callbacks when the breakpoints are crossed
[18:05:44] <Mattx> oh, really? I didn't find them
[18:05:46] <Mattx> let me see
[18:06:17] <doug65536> Mattx: http://xoxco.com/projects/code/breakpoints/
[18:06:46] <doug65536> Mattx: http://xoxco.com/projects/code/breakpoints/example.html
[18:08:18] <doug65536> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4dxgB/6/
[18:08:29] <Mattx> doug65536, it polls
[18:08:50] <Mattx> every 250ms
[18:09:06] <doug65536> Mattx: lol, really?
[18:09:09] <Mattx> yep
[18:09:09] <doug65536> sucks then
[18:09:13] <Mattx> https://github.com/xoxco/breakpoints/blob/master/breakpoints.js
[18:09:38] <Mattx> interval = setInterval(function() { ... }, 250)
[18:09:46] <veQue> doug65536 cool
[18:09:53] <doug65536> Mattx:  here's my resize debouncer  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pHKJU/
[18:11:32] <doug65536> Mattx: no polling. it prevents having to handle an excessive number of resize events
[18:11:53] <Mattx> nice, let me read it
[18:13:29] <Mattx> ok, something like that should work
[18:14:16] <Mattx> the only problem is that I'll have to hardcode the breakpoints, which are defined by bootstrap not me
[18:19:11] <gvo> I have a progressbar where I set disabled:true at creation time and test to see if it is disabled and it is, however it's being displayed.   Any ideas?
[18:24:56] <sayd> im looking at the tests in jquery-validation and see a line like validator.errors().filter(':visible'). it appears to be matching elmeents with style="display:none;" seems broke?
[18:32:31] <doug65536> gvo:I don't  think disabled means invisible
[18:32:47] <gvo> OK what's it mean?
[18:33:36] <doug65536> gvo: maybe it does... are you sure your selector is correct?
[18:33:58] <gvo> Hi Doug.  I think so  http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FEL/1/
[18:34:21] <doug65536> jqm docs are crap as usual. it says "Disables the progress par if set to true". what kind of idiot writes documentation like that. reminds me of boost docs
[18:34:28] <doug65536> bar*
[18:34:46] <gvo> lol I understand.
[18:35:13] <gvo> It's reverse logic.
[18:36:07] <gvo> Just for the heck of it I changed it to false.  Didn't help
[18:37:20] <doug65536> gvo: I think that is disabled
[18:37:37] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z5FEL/5/
[18:37:50] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z5FEL/6/
[18:38:32] <gvo> But I wanted an indeterminate bar.
[18:38:36] <doug65536> no need for those jqm data attributes http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z5FEL/7/
[18:38:41] <doug65536> gvo: if you want to hide it, hide it
[18:39:28] <gvo> I know.  But I was sort of trying to use it the right way, or what I though was the right way.  Off to hidey land.
[18:40:09] <doug65536> gvo: since when does disabled mean hide. I would stay away from stupidity like that if I could :)
[18:41:04] <doug65536> gvo: I'm going to look at source and see if I can figure out what 'disabled' actually means
[18:41:08] <gvo> I understand a form element being disabled means it's still visible, but since you don't really interact with a progress bar...  Oh well.
[18:41:18] <gvo> I figured it out.
[18:41:31] <gvo> Disabling it causes it to fade.
[18:41:46] <doug65536> exactly, so it "matches" disabled controls
[18:41:52] <gvo> But for some reason it won't start up disabled.
[18:41:55] <doug65536> that makes sense
[18:41:58] <gvo> Yes.
[18:42:11] <gvo> Thanks.
[18:42:17] <doug65536> np
[18:42:43] <gvo> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FEL/10/
[18:44:21] <doug65536> gvo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z5FEL/12/
[18:45:14] <sayd> ok im drunk, nm
[18:48:52] <doug65536> gvo: lol
[18:48:54] <doug65536> gvo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z5FEL/14/
[18:49:22] <doug65536> gvo: I'm easily amused when I'm tired
[18:49:26] <gvo> lol I like crazy!
[18:50:00] <gvo> I was wondering if it was the hour or substance abuse. ;)
[18:52:10] <doug65536> I'm stuck trying to find a silly bug. I'm making a 3D slider... http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/54/
[18:52:38] <doug65536> I can't see why it jumps right to the end immediately
[18:53:15] <doug65536> around line 118 it is supposed to do linear interpolation from the current values to the new values but it just jumps right to the end - it makes no sense
[18:54:34] <gvo> interval is in seconds or milliseconds?
[18:54:40] <doug65536> ms
[18:54:46] <gvo> Or micro seconds?
[18:54:57] <doug65536> ah... I think you just found it...
[18:55:07] <doug65536> I am dividing by time then multiplying by a value from 0 to 1
[18:55:40] <doug65536> gvo: much better http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/55/
[18:55:53] <doug65536> gvo: now the offsets are wrong though
[18:56:13] <gvo> That's better than jump to the end.
[18:57:23] <doug65536> gvo: yes thanks, your question pointed my eyes right at the bug :)
[18:57:38] <beachandbytes> doug65536,  http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FEL/15/
[18:57:43] <beachandbytes> crazy psychedilic now :)
[18:58:10] <doug65536> beachandbytes: lol, there we go...
[18:58:26] <gvo> doug65536: You are most welcome but I didn't do anything.  And I'm off to visit the sandman.
[18:59:08] <gvo> beachandbytes: Good!
[19:01:32] <Ernstoneded> hi guys, could anyone help a minute
[19:02:06] <Ernstoneded> http://jsfiddle.net/x8dSP/1336/  markers open windows fine, but the last opened marker does not close, anyone?
[19:02:11] <jarray52> I'm looking at a piece of code that has jquery event handlers bound to page elements. When I hover over elements, the cursor changes, and when I click overlays appear on the page. I want to find the javascript code that attaches the jquery event handler. How does one do this?
[19:02:32] <beachandbytes> look for the id or class of the item that you hover for
[19:03:40] <jarray52> beachandbytes: I tried this. The problem is that the page has multiple ids, classes, and other elements. It's unclear what combination of elements were used to attach the handler.
[19:04:34] <doug65536> jarray52: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FEL/15/
[19:04:42] <doug65536> that attaches click handlers to the buttons
[19:05:39] <beachandbytes> jarray52 do you have an example of the page
[19:06:39] <beachandbytes> nothing shows up for me Ernstoneded
[19:08:03] <jarray52> doug65536:  I'm trying to understand your comment.
[19:08:30] <jarray52> doug65536: Are you suggesting an alternative technology or suggesting that jsfiddle may be used in my source code?
[19:08:37] <Ernstoneded> shit what have i done now
[19:08:55] <doug65536> jarray52: jsfiddle is great for showing your code because we can fix/test/debug it on there
[19:09:08] <doug65536> jarray52: then post a link back to you with changes
[19:09:19] <Ernstoneded> http://jsfiddle.net/x8dSP/1342/
[19:09:24] <Ernstoneded> i posted the wrong url sorry
[19:10:29] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: over 1300 revisions?!
[19:11:02] <Primer> Hi, I'm developing a system using $(document).bind('customEvent', handler) then issuing $(document).trigger('customEvent') but it seems there are contexts in which the triggering isn't being caught. I'm wondering if using $(document) for this is really the best practice.
[19:11:24] <Primer> And if not, what is?
[19:11:40] <jarray52> doug65536: It would take me a while to get the code in a format that I can post on jsfiddle. I'll work on that if there is no other option.
[19:11:43] <doug65536> Primer: try $('body').trigger('customEvent')
[19:11:55] * Primer tries
[19:12:16] <Ernstoneded> nope
[19:12:28] <Ernstoneded> i was trying to find my example but could not
[19:12:41] <Ernstoneded> didnt bookmark what i was working and and its not in history
[19:12:46] <jarray52> beachandbytes: What makes this issue difficult is the number of javascript libraries that are used. I'm wondering if there is a debugging tool that will find the javascript code that attaches an event handler.
[19:12:50] <Primer> sigh...I have a feeling I'm just doing something stupid, but that didn't work either
[19:12:54] <Ernstoneded> so found a working version and added my code
[19:12:58] <doug65536> jarray52: it doesn't have to run, you could slap an example piece of html in the top left thing, save that, and show us a link
[19:13:42] <jarray52> doug65536: The problem is not with the html. The problem is with the javascript/jquery.
[19:13:47] <Primer> I'm using $.ajax({..., error: handler, timeout: 2, }) and issuing my $(whatever).trigger from the error handler
[19:14:09] <doug65536> jarray52: no, the problem is you're saying "there's a bunch of random html, how do I attach event handlers". how are we supposed to answer that?
[19:14:15] <Primer> I can't imagine this is so far out of context that it's not defined somehow
[19:14:36] <sammych> okay, this isn't great. async:false is deprecated. Need to change stuff to callbacks :(
[19:14:49] <Primer> guess I'll setup a fiddle
[19:15:50] <Ernstoneded> that markers now load doug65536 ?
[19:16:26] <Primer> ok, nm, it was a logic issue
[19:16:30] * Primer hangs head in shame
[19:16:32] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: what? yes, the pushpins are there when I test it
[19:16:40] <jarray52> doug65536: I'm asking a different question. I have html and javascript/jquery code with the event handlers attached. I want to find the location in my code where the event handler was attached. My question is whether there is a debugging tool or method that can help me answer that question.
[19:16:49] <Ernstoneded> when you click a marker the info window opens?
[19:16:58] <Ernstoneded> but if you click another the last does not close
[19:17:37] <doug65536> jarray52: my suggestion is switch to the readable (not the .min.js one, the .js one) jquery, and put a breakpoint at on: function() { ...
[19:18:06] <doug65536> jarray52: then you can look at the call stack and see if the caller is the problem spot
[19:19:24] <jarray52> What do you mean by function() { ...  The document ready? Or, the event handler itself?
[19:19:47] <doug65536> jarray52: all event attaches end up calling 'on' in jquery
[19:21:07] <beachandbytes> you can use event tracing in chrome jarray52
[19:21:12] <doug65536> jarray52: to be clear: put a breakpoint in jquery, in the 'on' function
[19:21:12] <beachandbytes> if you know what event it is
[19:21:32] <doug65536> beachandbytes: I think he wants to track down what code attaches the event handler
[19:22:08] <beachandbytes> if you know what dom element the event is on that should be pretty easy
[19:22:54] <jarray52> doug65536: Your suggestion is a great idea. I will try that after hearing beachandbytes out. The only problem with your suggestion is that I have to click through 100 or so event attaches before coming to the relevant one.
[19:23:22] <doug65536> jarray52: 100? what kind of page is this?
[19:23:41] <jarray52> doug65536: maybe less than 100.. I don't know.
[19:24:09] <beachandbytes> use a use a conditional breakpoint jarray52
[19:24:21] <beachandbytes> break when it gets to the type of element you want
[19:24:56] <jarray52> beachandbytes: I can find the actual event handler by clicking on firefox/chromes debugger "pause on entry". However, that stops me in the event handler not the code that does the attaching.
[19:25:59] <jarray52> beachandbytes: I don't know the condition. I'm not sure what combination of ids/classes were used to attach the event handler.
[19:26:47] <doug65536> jarray52: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/ef694f6cc77674fc119b8bfa32c74aa456b84eb6/src/event.js#L742
[19:28:31] <doug65536> jarray52: code that actually sets up the event handler https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/ef694f6cc77674fc119b8bfa32c74aa456b84eb6/src/event.js#L40
[19:30:17] <doug65536> jarray52: you might be able to use a hack where you intercept 'on' calls and console.log out the parameters, then call the real 'on'.
[19:30:23] <doug65536> jarray52: let me see if that works...
[19:31:43] <jarray52> doug65536, beachandbytes: I received a lot of helpful suggestions. I'm trying them out.
[19:33:28] <doug65536> jarray52: it does work: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/
[19:34:04] <beachandbytes> ahh thats cool
[19:34:08] <beachandbytes> i learned something new
[19:41:07] <doug65536> beachandbytes: yes, the way javascript treats functions as values is beautiful
[19:41:42] <doug65536> beachandbytes: I learned that trick in Lua
[19:42:25] <beachandbytes> haven't played with Lua ever
[19:42:29] <beachandbytes> has been on my list for a while
[19:42:57] <doug65536> beachandbytes: javascript is very much like lua. completely different object oriented syntax, but very similar
[19:43:43] <doug65536> beachandbytes: has same closure semantics and "functions are values" symantics.
[19:43:53] <doug65536> s/y/e/
[19:44:02] <jarray52> beachesandbytes: I'm trying to use the event listeners tab within chrome devtools. I'm now paused at the start of the event. What do I do now?
[19:44:14] <jarray52> doug65536: I will try your suggestion next.
[19:47:04] <doug65536> jarray52: greatly improved logging, outputs what elements got the event attached http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/2/
[19:47:32] <doug65536> jarray52: mousing over it in the console log highlights it on the page
[19:50:32] <doug65536> jarray52: improved again. now it numbers the attachments in the log and you can make it break at a specific number http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/3/
[19:50:40] <jarray52> doug65536: I'm looking at your code.
[19:52:10] <jarray52> So, I stick this in jquery and attach to a relevant class/id, and clicking will give me all the relevant event handlers attached to that item?
[19:52:38] <jarray52> I guess I could even stick the javascript inside my html page.
[19:52:56] <doug65536> jarray52: make that code I showed you run really early or definitely before the stuff is attached. it will intercept all event attaches and log them to console
[19:53:19] <doug65536> jarray52: once they are in the console, you can mouse over the things under selector: in the log and they will highlight in the page
[19:53:32] <jarray52> doug65536: That does more than I thought it did.
[19:53:35] <doug65536> once you figure out which event you want to catch, look at what number it is at the top
[19:53:46] <doug65536> then change attack_break to that number
[19:53:52] <doug65536> it will break in when that event is attached
[19:54:05] <jarray52> Cool
[19:54:19] <jarray52> Let me try this. This has to work.
[19:54:28] <Ernstoneded> anyone?
[19:55:02] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: a marker?
[19:55:11] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: oh the map thing
[19:55:51] <Ernstoneded> yeah
[19:56:07] <Ernstoneded> if you click a second marker you expect the first marker to close
[19:57:58] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: looking...
[20:03:04] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/x8dSP/1350/
[20:03:25] <Ernstoneded> thx
[20:03:27] <Ernstoneded> what was the issue ?
[20:03:31] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: line 36 and line 72 thru 76
[20:04:21] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: I just added a thing that tracks the current window, and closes the current window before creating a new one
[20:04:35] <doug65536> s/window/infowindow/
[20:04:40] <Ernstoneded> so if current_info / infowindow
[20:04:50] <Ernstoneded> not == null
[20:05:21] <Ernstoneded> so i dont even need this line:  			infowindow.close(map, markers.marker);
[20:05:30] <Ernstoneded> i have removed it and it still works :)
[20:05:44] <Ernstoneded> thx doug
[20:05:48] <Ernstoneded> you done this before?
[20:05:51] <doug65536> Ernstoneded: yeah, I'm not sure. this is first time I looked at their api
[20:06:21] <LoneSoldier728> hm ok i am trying to think what is a better route should i use this
[20:06:21] <LoneSoldier728> https://www.addthis.com/get/sharing#.UhbRMhush8E
[20:06:30] <LoneSoldier728> or actually talk to facebook api myself
[20:06:36] <LoneSoldier728> and create the button manually?
[20:06:55] <LoneSoldier728> i think the only difference is that add this resells what user's do
[20:06:55] <Ernstoneded> i was thinking of adding things like directions
[20:07:08] <Ernstoneded> not sure if it will work without wifi
[20:07:17] <jarray52> doug65536: Do you know why I'm getting this error with your code? https://dpaste.de/K0mfY/
[20:07:20] <LoneSoldier728> because it seems that they sell data information of what people's behaviors are
[20:08:25] <doug65536> jarray52: make sure that my code runs after jquery is loaded
[20:08:46] <doug65536> jarray52: that's in fiddle?
[20:09:29] <jarray52> doug65536: That's in the actual application. I pasted the console output. The home: <x> are the line numbers.
[20:09:47] <jarray52> doug65536: I did make sure the code runs after jquery.
[20:09:51] <jarray52> is loaded.
[20:09:52] <doug65536> jarray52: did you leave any out?
[20:10:11] <doug65536> jarray52: it looks like you didn't grab all the code
[20:10:22] <doug65536> jarray52: it's as though you didn't copy line 3
[20:10:53] <doug65536> var orig_on = $.fn.on; is in the code in your page?
[20:11:29] <jarray52> Yes.
[20:11:46] <jarray52> I'm using an old jquery version.
[20:11:59] <doug65536> what version. I'll try to adapt it
[20:12:44] <jarray52> 1.6.1
[20:12:54] <jarray52> I'm not sure that is the problem though.
[20:12:58] <Ernstoneded> anyone used phonegap to create mobile app ?
[20:13:17] <doug65536> jarray52: ok, it crashes in fiddle with 1.6.4... let me see if I can fix it
[20:14:01] <jarray52> doug65536: Just realized that jsfiddle allows the selection of jquery versions. That is so cool!
[20:20:14] <doug65536> jarray52: this should work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/7/
[20:20:29] <doug65536> oops, remove debugger statement though
[20:21:57] <doug65536> jarray52: remove "use strict" if it causes you any trouble as well
[20:22:12] <doug65536> jarray52: makes js more picky to help find bugs
[20:39:36] <jarray52> doug65536: Now, I load your code immediately after jquery. However, I'm not getting any console output. Here is the output I do get.  https://dpaste.de/CuKv5/
[20:47:08] <lethjakman> hey, I have a little string that appends a bunch of <tr><td>'s to a table and I'm wondering if there's a cleaner way to do it. it looks like this:
[20:47:14] <lethjakman> $('#search_table').append "<tr><td>" + media['name'] + "</td><td>" + media['creator'] + "</td><td>" + media['media_type'] + "</td></tr>";
[20:48:18] <lethjakman> I apologise...that's coffeescript, that would need ('s around it.
[20:48:24] <lethjakman> but other than that it's the same.
[20:53:39] <doug65536> lethjakman: that is not safe. you need to escape things like < and & in html
[20:55:34] <doug65536> jarray52: that is strange. the fiddle works correctly, right?
[20:56:44] <doug65536> jarray52: can you show me an example of an event being attached in jq 1.6.4?
[20:56:50] <doug65536> .1 I mean
[20:59:02] <jarray52> I will upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and see if that works.
[21:00:03] <tw2113> why so low of a version number?
[21:04:20] <doug65536> lethjakman: var tab = $('#search_table'); var row = $('<tr/>'); row.append($('<td/>').text(media.name)); row.append($('<td/>').text(media.media_type)); tab.append(row);
[21:04:33] <lethjakman> doug65536: ahh I see what you're saying
[21:04:40] <lethjakman> is there a better way to append html elements though?
[21:05:12] <lethjakman> doug65536: ahh ok that makes sense, thank you.
[21:05:26] <doug65536> lethjakman: np
[21:05:30] <lethjakman> that looks cleaner too :)
[21:10:40] <jarray52> doug65536: https://dpaste.de/LfpRD/
[21:11:24] <jarray52> That's with Jquery 1.6.4.
[21:11:43] <doug65536> why does it look like the fiddle?
[21:11:56] <doug65536> <p class="by_class"> etc
[21:12:27] <jarray52> What do you mean by why does it look like the fiddle?
[21:12:58] <doug65536> "the fiddle" is the thing on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/7/
[21:13:35] <doug65536> those lines from line 17 thru 22 are just tests
[21:13:43] <doug65536> that's all the output you get?
[21:14:42] <doug65536> jarray52: oh sorry. I didn't change one of the names. this one should work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CGE4D/9/
[21:15:29] <doug65536> jarray52: don't bother grabbing the $('#by_id... and the rest
[21:15:35] <doug65536> jarray52: they are just tests
[21:15:53] <doug65536> jarray52: just copy up to line 16
[21:16:02] <doug65536> lines 3 thru 16 to be safe
[21:23:59] <jarray52> doug65536: That works. I have 13 events.
[21:25:42] <doug65536> jarray52: cool
[21:26:55] <jarray52> doug65536: However, the selector is blank for all 13 events.
[21:28:12] <doug65536> jarray52: the objects that the selector "selects" are on the lines that follow the "selector:" line
[21:28:36] <doug65536> if you mouse over those it will highlight those objects on the page
[21:31:47] <jarray52> doug65536: Do you mean mouse over in "inspect element" mode?
[21:32:23] <doug65536> jarray52: in the console output
[21:33:31] <jarray52> I don't get additional output when I mouse over or click on elements. Jquery's calendar object just pops up.
[21:33:36] <jarray52> jquery-ui.
[21:36:18] <lethjakman> is there a way to make sure that my global ajax complete is called before my global ajax success?
[22:11:46] <jarray52> doug65536: Is there a professional debugging tool that does what your script intends to do?
[22:12:16] <doug65536> jarray52: not that I know of
[22:12:25] <doug65536> what output do you get in the console?
[22:12:58] <doug65536> lethjakman: that is impossible. the whole idea of "complete" is that it is called *after* either success or error
[22:13:56] <lethjakman> doug65536: switched it to a ajaxSend and it actually makes more sense that way anyways, thanks :)
[22:14:57] <doug65536> jarray52: can you show a few things from the output of the script?
[22:16:09] <jarray52> doug65536: https://dpaste.de/wJVg7/
[22:16:54] <jarray52> doug65536: sorry... that was the wrong page.
[22:22:02] <jarray52> doug65536: https://dpaste.org/fs4Ef/
[22:22:19] <Cronoh> what should i look at if my sortable events are not firing?  The list is sortable but start and update events are doing nothing, im trying to console.log right after with no success
[22:31:15] <doug65536> jarray52: ok it is working as expected
[22:31:53] <doug65536> jarray52: what I was saying was, if you mouse over the html in the console, such as <a rel="nofollow" data-remote.... etc it will highlight that thing on the page
[22:32:45] <doug65536> jarray52: is one of those events one that you want to see where it is attached from?
[22:33:49] <doug65536> you can also right click on those things and you can jump to the html for it
[22:34:12] <doug65536> you could also put "debugger" inside the function in my code, and it will stop at each event attach
[22:34:38] <doug65536> then on the right side of the sources tab, you can look at the call stack, and click on items, and it will take you to that code
[22:35:32] <doug65536> debugger;    <-- that will break into debugger when executed
[22:36:01] <tonph> guys - yesterday i was stuck with multiple form submit button, and handling the button value, still stuck
[22:36:13] <tonph> any help please... http://jsfiddle.net/tonph/8GQTh/16/
[22:36:39] <tonph> here i want to get the button value which triggered the submit on form submit..
[22:39:10] <sammych> alrighty. I have a small (300KB) item listing (it might become much larger later, maybe towards 1MB) and I'm deciding between having the data that file be loaded by AJAX when it's required, or having the whole listing loaded at load but only if the date modified has changed.
[22:40:49] <sammych> Basically, it'll be a JSP file with a public var that stores the JSON string. Each time the page is polled, that JSP will check the alter_date on a table holding this data. If that data is updated, the JSON string is updated, the response date is set to the new alter_date
[22:41:05] <sammych> the real Javascript question is this:
[22:41:21] <sammych> is keeping a 1MB object in memory a good idea?
[22:41:56] <sammych> keeping in mind this app will be running from iPads to full powered tablets like Surfaces
[22:42:13] <doug65536> tonph: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8GQTh/22/
[22:42:57] <doug65536> tonph: oops http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8GQTh/23/
[22:43:06] <doug65536> was getting name instead of value
[22:45:38] <jarray52> doug65536: Where does one find the attachment point when stopped at the debugger? I inserted the debugger statement at the very beginning of your code.
[22:46:00] <doug65536> jarray52: in the sources tab, on the right side there is a call stack display
[22:46:09] <doug65536> each item in that list goes back one call
[22:46:22] <jarray52> in chrome?
[22:46:25] <doug65536> yes
[22:46:42] <tonph> thanks doug65536: but ll not be able to handle as submit as i have `content.on('submit', '#myform', formSubmit);`
[22:46:53] <doug65536> tonph: why
[22:47:17] <doug65536> tonph: yes what you had was useless
[22:47:41] <doug65536> tonph: you can't find out what they clicked from there
[22:48:24] <doug65536> tonph: you're saying, "what I had won't work, but I have to keep it like this, can you fix it without changing it?"
[22:48:24] <tonph> doug65536 : so looks like it is not possible to find who clicked the submit, if iwe try to handle as submit ...
[22:49:23] <tonph> doug655336 : if the way i m trying not possible ,then i think i have to change it.
[22:49:40] <doug65536> tonph: if it went through as a normal submit, the server would see foobar=<whatever>
[22:49:57] <doug65536> but in js I'm not sure that's possible. .serialize() can't know
[22:50:37] <doug65536> tonph: do you need to simulate "normal" behavior, and pass foobar=<the value> in an ajax submit?
[22:50:57] <doug65536> tonph: it would help if I knew the real problem, not just this narrowed down thing
[22:51:42] <doug65536> tonph: so my solution was to capture the click of submit buttons, backtrack from there to find the form, then I can get information about the submit click
[22:52:01] <doug65536> tonph: if you need to add that information to the serialize() I can help with that
[22:52:12] <tonph> yesh ,removing the serialize() and normal submit through ajax submit - that is fine i think
[22:55:05] <jarray52> doug65536: I just realized that your function produces a lot more console output in Firefox.
[22:55:15] <jarray52> doug65536: I meant Chrome
[22:55:29] <jarray52> It produces more console output in Chrome than Firefox.
[22:55:32] <Cronoh> wtf man jquery sortable is acting query, im trying to get the toArray function to work after the update event fires, but its giving me the object as a result
[22:55:36] <doug65536> jarray52: ah, yes. I thought you were using chrome already
[22:55:43] <Cronoh> acting weird**
[22:55:47] <doug65536> jarray52: no wonder you didn't know what I meant :)
[22:57:43] <jarray52> doug65536: I was using both. I typically use Firefox for development but you were refering to Chrome; so, I had it open.
[22:57:43] <doug65536> tonph: this change should simulate a "real" submit if you want to use ajax to do it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8GQTh/29/
[22:58:13] <doug65536> tonph: it adds the name and value to the data, like a real submit would have
[22:59:06] <doug65536> tonph: is that what you were looking for?
[22:59:38] <doug65536> jarray52: did you see the call stack?
[23:01:25] <tonph> doug65536 : thanks yes this is cool.. still i found the way i did with submit is a bit weird.
[23:02:24] <jarray52> doug65536: It says {anonymous function}. That's it.
[23:02:39] <doug65536> jarray52: click it - it will take you there
[23:04:25] <jarray52> doug65536: Am I suppose to insert a debugger statement or set your attach_break. You wanted me to set your attach_break, right?
[23:04:51] <doug65536> jarray52: you still have a debugger; statement in the function in my code?
[23:05:47] <doug65536> jarray52: if you put debugger; inside the function, it will pause execution at each event attach...
[23:06:00] <jarray52> doug65536: There were two debugger statements initially. One at the beginning and one inside the if block that tests if attach_seq == attach_break.
[23:06:04] <doug65536> then you can look at the call stack and click on entries in the call stack to look at caller's code
[23:06:54] <doug65536> jarray52: ah ok. to make it break every time, put debugger; as the first line of that function
[23:06:56] <jarray52> doug65536: With the debugger statement at the beginning, I cannot click anonymous function. It is greyed out. Deleting that one and using attach_break=0, i get.
[23:07:20] <doug65536> none of the console output looked like what you are looking for?
[23:07:48] <jarray52> ah right... that's sort of obvious from your code.
[23:09:27] <sammych> who wants to tell me how browser file caching works on mobile?
[23:09:49] <sammych> I want to store a 1MB file in cache and/or localstorage
[23:09:55] <sammych> well, 1MB of data
[23:12:27] <doug65536> sammych: I think the best you can do is fetch json, and let it cache, and let the browser worry about that
[23:12:52] <doug65536> sammych: if it can cache, it will cache. if it has to refetch, it will refetch
[23:13:27] <doug65536> sammych: if you've already decided you're going to store it, then store it
[23:13:34] <doug65536> sammych: what's the question
[23:14:58] <jarray52> doug65536: This is exactly what I want. Thanks for your help.
[23:14:59] <sammych> the question is if I get all the data on load, and never worry about using AJAX to get the parts I need
[23:15:07] <doug65536> jarray52: np
[23:17:34] <sammych> doug65536: the data is an occasionally updated listing of items. I would normally fetch items via AJAX that I haven't already got in the local cache. Or I could skip that whole chicanery and have all the data local
[23:18:05] <sammych> that local cache starts from blank, and builds up as the user looks at items via the front end
[23:18:59] <doug65536> sammych: if you use GET requests, the ajax will be cached automatically. your ajax requests will instantly return data from the cache if it has already been retrieved
[23:19:26] <doug65536> sammych: and the browser is free to store it to flash memory if necessary - it's not forced to keep it in RAM
[23:19:55] <sammych> doug65536: the requests will rarely, if ever, have the same params
[23:20:16] <sammych> because I send out a list of itemIDs I don't have, and it'll get all of them
[23:20:24] <doug65536> sammych: then what do you mean by "caching"
[23:20:30] <doug65536> you know what caching means right?
[23:20:37] <sammych> fine, let be clearer
[23:21:16] <sammych> I have a local 'cache' that updates as the user uses app. It's built up via AJAX calls
[23:21:57] <sammych> my question is using GET to get the entire listing that's now being picked at by those small AJAX requests
[23:22:28] <sammych> so basically, that file will be a static web resource, that I'll use to fill out the local cache in JS
[23:23:08] <sammych> it's basically the original 'on demand' system, except that I load everything at the beginning
[23:23:32] <sammych> so I'll never request stuff on demand
[23:23:43] <sammych> I think I should've started with that
[23:23:53] <sammych> 'on demand' or load up 1MB of JSON
[23:24:28] <sammych> final clarification
[23:24:52] <sammych> GET -> JSON -> var itemListing = JSON.parse()
[23:25:41] <doug65536> sammych: HTML5 spec suggest allowing at least 5MB for local storage
[23:25:46] <doug65536> but that is only a suggestion
[23:26:43] <doug65536> sammych: do you know how to use local storage already?
[23:26:45] <Tamborine> hey guys. I have a counter that I'm counting down and writing to a span to let a user know how long they have left. Can someone tell me why .text() is never populating the span? console.log does produce the number counting down correctly..... http://pastebin.com/zZ1UdH3n
[23:27:20] <sammych> doug65536: LS is a consideration. So I could have the JSON sit in LS. On load I'll see if the local storage data is up to date, otherwise, I'll request for the whole listing
[23:27:35] <doug65536> Tamborine: the variable 'time' is not present in the paste
[23:27:54] <sammych> doug65536: yeah I've used it before
[23:28:11] <Tamborine> doug65536: sorry that was a typo as I stipped it back for a pastebin... it is actually calling timerTotal
[23:28:16] <Tamborine> .text(timerTotal);
[23:29:00] <doug65536> Tamborine: there's nothing wrong with that code then
[23:29:26] <doug65536> Tamborine: I'm not sure how well - works in an id. I'd guess it's ok but I'm not sure
[23:29:44] <doug65536> Tamborine: that control has id="logout-countdown" ?
[23:29:48] <doug65536> that element
[23:29:55] <Tamborine> doug65536: my thoughts exactly... a console.log(timerTotal) produces a corret countdown, but the .text is not writing to the div.. I have confirmed the div is there and console logs as the correct object span#logout-countdown
[23:31:56] <doug65536> Tamborine: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ywp96/3/
[23:32:45] <sammych> ugh, never mind, I'll make that a roadmap improvement
[23:33:17] <doug65536> Tamborine: span works too http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ywp96/4/
[23:33:24] <Tamborine> what that?
[23:33:56] <doug65536> Tamborine: you've never seen jsfiddle before?
[23:34:10] <Tamborine> no no.. what the as in why is it working for you ;)
[23:34:27] <doug65536> Tamborine: my guess is app.config.userActionTimeout is your problem
[23:34:47] <doug65536> other than that - check your console. script is probably crashing somewhere
[23:39:38] <doug65536> Tamborine: is the id in the html #logout-countdown?
[23:39:46] <doug65536> Tamborine: I've made that mistake before
[23:41:34] <dreamhawk> hello, can someone help me with some, strange "getJSON" problem? getJSON + each... on one server i can use $.each(data, function(index) { console.log(data[index].ConsumerID) }); for example, on the other server, i can not... And it frustrates me, i cant find what is wrong really
[23:42:33] <doug65536> dreamhawk: you are doing it the hard way
[23:43:12] <doug65536> dreamhawk: shouldn't that be $.each(data, function() { console.log(this.ConsumerID); })
[23:43:23] <dreamhawk> doug65536: probably ^^, but ive tackled with this problem since yesterday, and now i am a bit.. lost..
[23:44:00] <dreamhawk> doug65536: i can try... but the example i gave, is a working example on another server... well, atleast i think its working, its not complaining, but on this other site, it always returns "undefined"
[23:44:18] <doug65536> dreamhawk: yeah I'm not suggesting that will fix it
[23:44:23] <doug65536> what do you mean "another server"
[23:44:42] <doug65536> it's obvious that the problem is on the server then, right?
[23:44:59] <doug65536> did you put a breakpoint in the each function and look at 'data' ?
[23:45:07] <dreamhawk> doug65536: my home server with jquery 2.x and .. i think latest jquery ui aswell
[23:45:29] <dreamhawk> doug65536: i did a console.log(data) to see what came back, and the values are there.
[23:45:56] <doug65536> dreamhawk: yes I don't care about the one that works. I mean the one where there is a problem
[23:46:35] <dreamhawk> doug65536: there we are using jquery 1.8.1 . And "this.ConsumerID" did not work, returned "Undefined"
[23:46:40] <doug65536> dreamhawk: does the 'each' loop even run? you probably aren't getting any callback when it doesn't work
[23:47:33] <dreamhawk> yes, cause .each(data, function(i,v) { console.log(i +":"+ v); }); is working
[23:47:42] <dreamhawk> it returns the data.
[23:48:25] <doug65536> dreamhawk: put this somewhere near startup: $.ajaxSetup({error: function(xhr,message) { console.log('Ajax error: ' + message); }});
[23:49:06] <doug65536> dreamhawk: forget the working one. you're telling me the one with a problem is "working"?
[23:50:16] <dreamhawk> doug65536: i meant that .each(data, function(i,v) { console.log(i +":"+ v); }); is working on the server where data[index].ConsumerID is not working... and that blows my mind
[23:50:55] <doug65536> dreamhawk: oh ok. yes, well that's what each is for. you might as well use a "real" js for loop to do what you were doing
[23:51:28] <doug65536> dreamhawk: the whole idea of each is that it looks up the value for you
[23:51:48] <dreamhawk> doug65536: probably, i've just followed my own working example... but i get confused when it doesnt work on server 2
[23:52:09] <doug65536> dreamhawk: is it fixed or not?
[23:52:52] <dreamhawk> doug65536: not fixed.
[23:53:11] <doug65536> did you put the ajaxSetup I posted in?
[23:53:31] <doug65536> please stop confusing me by talking about the working one
[23:53:34] <dreamhawk> yes, but it didnt return anything
[23:53:42] <dreamhawk> I am not talking about the working one ^^,
[23:54:20] <doug65536> so it prints all that stuff to the console, yet it doesn't work...
[23:54:28] <doug65536> I'm lost
[23:54:57] <doug65536> <dreamhawk> yes, cause .each(data, function(i,v) { console.log(i +":"+ v); }); is working
[23:55:22] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yes, that one returns data on the "not working" server..
[23:56:08] <dreamhawk> doug65536: but i want to declare it to variables, and "i.ConsumerID" is not wokring, and "v.ConsumerID" is not working... :)
[23:57:05] <doug65536> dreamhawk: in the working output, you see ConsumerID:<some value> ?
[23:57:55] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yes, thats correct, i see it in console.log, then i want to add it to variable
[23:58:08] <doug65536> then don't use each
[23:58:20] <doug65536> that information is already "in a variable". data.ConsumerID
[23:59:24] <dreamhawk> but what if i have to loop it ?
[23:59:58] <doug65536> dreamhawk: there is no "what if". does the server randomly return arrays or single objects?
