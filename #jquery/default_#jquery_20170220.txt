[02:34:18] <terens> hello
[02:35:02] <terens> any idea how to have easy templates ?
[02:35:10] <terens> without using any templating engine
[03:30:52] <al_nz1> evening
[03:31:22] <Cork> terens: there is the build in template feature in the js standard
[03:31:39] <Cork> terens: though that isn't as much templates as just a way to create dom structures
[03:32:03] <terens> is it compatible
[03:34:21] <Cork> not really, it is fairly new
[03:34:42] <Cork> you can do <script type="text/template" id="my-template"></script> though
[03:36:54] <al_nz1> I cant work out why when I submit my form only some of the form fields are in the POST? http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/index1.html
[03:37:53] <Cork> al_nz1: some fields don't have names
[03:40:31] <al_nz1> Cork: take for example proximity, it shows up, location type doesnt?
[03:41:09] <Cork> al_nz1: <select size="3" class="selectpicker" id="locationtype" th:field="*{locationtype}" title="Choose" required="true"> <-- no name=""
[03:41:22] <Cork> id != name
[03:42:41] <al_nz1> Cork: my bad - just reread ur answer
[03:42:44] <al_nz1> great
[03:42:45] <al_nz1> thanks
[03:43:05] <al_nz1> i need to get some zz, late here
[03:43:08] <al_nz1> back in morn!
[03:43:10] <al_nz1> thanks again
[04:16:25] <terens> Hi. Any idea how to have templates without
[04:16:51] <terens> templateting framework
[04:18:29] <Cork> terens: i've already answered that
[04:58:24] <printForever> how to get the value (name) of the last key in object? Object.keys(myObject).last???
[04:59:03] <Cork> printForever: var keys = Object.keys(myObject); keys[keys.length -1]
[04:59:40] <printForever> I will try it
[05:00:55] <printForever> Cork I'm getting 9 instead of 19
[05:01:06] <Cork> printForever: objects isn't ordered
[05:01:15] <Cork> so it is the value added last, not highest
[05:01:16] <printForever> so .sort
[05:01:24] <Cork> it is also strings
[05:01:29] <printForever> ok
[05:01:29] <Cork> so 9 > 1
[05:01:54] <Cork> printForever: sounds like what you should do is use an array not object
[05:02:06] <printForever> I can't
[05:03:09] <printForever> I'm getting a output of an object
[05:03:24] <printForever> being sorted staring with 10, 11, 12... and ending in 7, 8, 9
[05:03:30] <printForever> I've used .sort()
[05:03:33] <Cork> ya, as it is strings
[05:03:44] <printForever> oh
[05:03:52] <Cork> object keys are always strings
[05:04:03] <printForever> so I should convert it to int before sorting?
[05:04:17] <Cork> or just have the output use an array >_<
[05:04:23] <Cork> but ya
[05:04:23] <printForever> ok ok ok
[05:04:30] <printForever> can Array have key value pair?
[05:04:40] <Cork> sure [{}, {}, {}]
[05:04:51] <printForever> oh
[05:05:23] <printForever> so [ {10: 800}, {11: 900}, {12: 200}]
[05:05:46] <Cork> well the number should prob be the index in the array
[05:05:57] <Cork> cause else you aren't gaining anything from your current structure
[05:06:33] <printForever> ?
[05:06:38] <printForever> isn't it already index?
[05:06:47] <printForever> I mean, by default
[05:07:16] <Cork> i meant like [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,800,900,200]
[05:07:37] <Cork> unless you commonly will have gaps in the number serie though
[05:07:51] <Cork> (or a huge gap to the first number)
[05:09:41] <printForever> hm...
[05:09:47] <printForever> stupid question
[05:09:53] <printForever> can I sort the object?
[05:11:03] <printForever> It cant be used as an index
[05:11:11] <printForever> it has to be a key value pair
[05:11:36] <Cork> no, you can't
[05:11:40] <Cork> objects don't have an order
[05:12:01] <printForever> so I can either have a multidimensional array or an object
[05:12:04] <printForever> and I can't sort an object
[05:12:10] <printForever> well f...ck
[05:12:13] <Cork> or you can have an array of objects
[05:12:35] <Cork> [{id: num, value: ""},{id: num, value: ""}] is a fairly common structure
[05:12:41] <printForever> ummmm like [ {10: 800}, {11: 900} ]
[05:12:48] <printForever> oh
[05:12:49] <Cork> depending on what data you're working with
[05:13:16] <printForever> ummmm like [ {id: 10, value: "800"}, {id: 11, value: "900"} ]
[05:14:13] <printForever> but it would call for different...
[05:14:17] <printForever> I get it
[05:14:18] <Cork> ya, though you might want to replace "value" with something descriptive
[05:14:34] <printForever> then I would have to change everything
[05:14:38] <Cork> also it doens't have to be a string if it really is a number
[05:15:02] <Cork> (the "900" part)
[05:15:20] <printForever> right
[05:15:35] <Cork> it is one of the reasons to not store values in keys, as the value part can have any format, while keys are always strings
[05:16:18] <printForever> its strange that one can't sort object by key
[05:16:23] <printForever> without moving it to array
[05:17:48] <Cork> printForever: not really, you can't sort hashes either
[05:17:57] <Cork> (from other languages)
[05:18:06] <printForever> oh
[05:18:12] <Cork> heck in some languages hashes is explicitly random in order
[05:18:18] <Cork> not "keeps order" as it is in js
[05:19:11] <Cork> and then we have php that is completely confused and can't say what is array or not :D
[05:24:26] <printForever> why is that?
[05:24:39] <printForever> or what do you mean by that?
[05:24:47] <Cork> array(value, value,value) == array
[05:24:53] <printForever> ok
[05:25:03] <Cork> array(key => value, key => value) == object/hash
[05:25:07] <Cork> THAT is why
[05:25:10] <printForever> oooooh
[05:25:18] <printForever> but... I've never seen it like that
[05:25:25] <printForever> for me it was just a an array with key/value
[05:25:40] <Cork> ya, but no other language agrees with them
[05:25:43] <printForever> and you're comparing it with object and hash
[05:25:51] <printForever> php... smarter
[05:25:53] <printForever> :D
[05:25:58] <Cork> no, just confused
[05:26:07] <printForever> they are special
[05:26:10] <Cork> ya
[05:26:50] * Cork realizes he haven't been using php for so long that he has started to forget the array syntax...
[05:37:16] <hamdjan> hi
[05:38:26] <hamdjan> how can i match one of two class?   this matches currently only "view1", but i want that it matches also the class "view2":       $('.view1').on('touchstart', function(e)
[05:44:39] <ctmarco> Hello all!
[06:59:41] <Cork> hamdjan: separate them with comma
[07:45:54] <KhursheedAli> Hi, I'm new to GSoc and opensource community. I want to start contributing in open source community. Any guidelines related to 2017 GSOC projects and from where to start with.
[07:54:16] <Cork> KhursheedAli: best is prob to ask in #jquery-dev
[07:57:28] <KhursheedAli> @CorK sure, thank you.
[08:07:34] <codecutter> Cork: around?
[08:08:35] <codecutter> have a look at this highchart, what do you think the white parts represent? http://picpaste.com/areaa-chart-8Yd2BNaN.png
[08:09:41] <MassDebates> Looks Like Buffalo Wild Wings' stock chart
[08:10:09] <Cork> codecutter: zeros or null values in the graph
[08:10:55] <codecutter> i thought that was the case.
[08:11:33] <Cork> though the second one makes me thing you might have a third track
[08:11:54] <Cork> but ya, donno
[08:11:54] <codecutter> you mean 3 series?
[08:11:57] <Cork> ya
[08:12:17] <Cork> how it cuts through both the red and green looks suspicious
[08:12:36] <codecutter> 3rd series being null values?
[08:12:58] <codecutter> hmm
[08:12:59] <Cork> no being max and a few zero or null values (namely two)
[08:13:25] <Cork> but ya, impossible to tell from an image
[08:13:54] <Cork> you could inspect the generated svg and see if it is a separate layer causing the white area
[08:14:06] <Cork> it if is it's a separate serie
[08:14:16] <Cork> else it is a value in one of the other
[08:14:24] <Cork> thirdly possible is a rendering bug
[08:14:27] <codecutter> i think i see it now
[08:15:09] <codecutter> red section represents negative, green, positive and white represents neutral
[08:15:24] <codecutter> does that make sense?
[08:15:54] <codecutter> red=negtaive, green=positive, white=neutral
[08:16:09] <Cork> i don't know what you're plotting so can't say
[08:16:19] <codecutter> i know
[08:19:29] <beeryboy> hey i was wondering if anyone knew if bootstrap is ignored when appended as i cant seem to get my bootstrap when appended but it works when added to the source html
[08:19:52] <YokoBR> hi folks
[08:20:27] <YokoBR> I'm trying to reorder li's with css order, but it's not working. Could somebody give a shot? This is the code https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/
[08:20:42] <Cork> beeryboy: => ##bootstrap
[08:21:11] <beeryboy> sorry i tried joining bootstrap but it didnt come up, i shall try again
[08:21:41] <Cork> note the double ##
[08:22:27] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/2/
[08:23:10] <Cork> YokoBR: i would strongly recommend using event handlers instead of event attributes, makes the code a lot cleaner to follow
[08:23:26] <Cork> YokoBR: also you can use relative dom element and skip the ids
[08:23:48] <Cork> $(this).closest('li')
[08:23:51] <YokoBR> Cork: I can't, because it will refresh the inner html, and I need to keep the inner html's changes
[08:24:04] <YokoBR> oh, i see
[08:24:07] <YokoBR> that can be done :)
[08:24:32] <dglambert> morning
[08:24:32] <Cork> also use delegated event handlers, again removes the problem you're talking about
[08:33:02] <codecutter> Cork: how do i make it look like the above? https://jsfiddle.net/aj6Lbd6y/
[08:33:08] <codecutter> the one*
[08:36:10] <codecutter> i need to sync all 3 series with the date
[08:36:42] <codecutter> lets assume red=negative, green=positive and white=neutral
[08:40:36] <MacroMan> Can I use prop() with my own attribute names?
[08:42:19] <Cork> MacroMan: you prob want to use .attr there
[08:42:37] <Cork> MacroMan: also, as you meantioned it, make sure you prefix your own attributes with data-
[08:43:15] <Cork> as else it risks colliding with spec changes and cause problems for you and them (if it gets common enough) in the future
[08:44:06] <Cork> MacroMan: but .prop('') as calling [''] on the raw dom element
[08:44:15] <Cork> so everything you can get there works
[08:48:37] <MacroMan> Cork, Thanks. I'll prob use data() method as it handles boolean
[08:49:07] <Cork> MacroMan: note though that .data parses the attribute and stores it in a cache in jquery
[08:49:21] <Cork> and if it has an entry in the cache it won't check the attribute on the element
[08:49:33] <Cork> it is normally fine, as long as you write and read using .data()
[08:49:37] <Cork> but it is worth knowing
[08:51:15] <MacroMan> Didn't know that it was chached, thanks for letting me know.
[08:51:40] <Cork> MacroMan: it is cause .data() supports compex data structures
[08:52:06] <Cork> you can store data-something="{\"key\": [1,2,3]}"
[08:52:32] <Cork> and .data('something').key == [1,2,3]
[08:52:54] <Cork> and that's quite nifty :)
[08:54:56] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/rtofd6jt/
[08:55:45] <MacroMan> Cork, Got that thanks
[08:56:13] <Cork> note you need to use &quot; in the json
[08:58:43] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/aj6Lbd6y/
[09:00:15] <codecutter> how do i make this chart (highchart)  https://jsfiddle.net/aj6Lbd6y/ look like the one you see here: http://picpaste.com/areaa-chart-8Yd2BNaN.png
[09:01:01] <Cork> codecutter: what, you mean color?
[09:01:09] <codecutter> no
[09:01:19] <codecutter> you can ignore the color
[09:01:30] <Cork> then what are you asking for?
[09:01:37] <codecutter> i'm talking about the pattern, and smooth curve
[09:02:01] <YokoBR> please, guys, could someone help me with this? -> https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/7/ I've already done Cork's hints
[09:02:41] <codecutter> notice how my example had a sharp corner, unlike the other chart which has a smooth curve
[09:03:21] <Cork> YokoBR: https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/8/
[09:03:39] <codecutter> also, it would help if the pattern is also similar so I can see how each series works
[09:04:34] <codecutter> date range  should be 7 days
[09:04:57] <codecutter> actually ignore date range
[09:05:23] <codecutter> that will complicate things
[09:05:29] <codecutter> keep things simple for now
[09:05:56] <YokoBR> Cork: it doesn't work
[09:06:59] <codecutter> actually the sharpness of the corner maybe dependant upon the data
[09:08:58] <Cork> YokoBR: ya, it was to use delegated instead of adding one event listener for each row
[09:09:22] <Cork> YokoBR: the problem is that css order isn't working on those elements for some reason (not fully sure why)
[09:09:27] <Cork> so order is always 0
[09:09:32] <Cork> (on all of the elements)
[09:16:07] <Cork> YokoBR: also isn't it just simpler to move the elements in the dom tree then fiddling with the css order?
[09:17:23] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/10/
[09:17:41] <YokoBR> Cork: yep, but they were not changing order. I've updated it, not it barelly works.
[09:18:49] <Cork> YokoBR: https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/15/
[09:18:57] <Cork> much simpler XD
[09:19:52] <YokoBR> Cork: As I said, I can't use that because it would "update" the html (li's inner html), and I need to preserve it
[09:20:04] <YokoBR> Because I can change it
[09:20:15] <Cork> YokoBR: but you will change the inner html when you update the style attribute too
[09:20:36] <Cork> you can't do any changes except through classes on a parent if you can't change anything on the dom element
[09:23:00] <YokoBR> Cork, this is a better example of "why not", https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/16/. In my application, I have iframes that can have their innerhtml changed
[09:23:13] <YokoBR> that solution would refresh the iframe
[09:23:40] <Cork> ah, and it changes it based on dom position?
[09:24:59] <Cork> in that case you will have to loop over all lis every time a button is pressed and modify the order value of all of them
[09:25:21] <Cork> else you will always have problem with elements getting the same number (eventually)
[09:25:40] <Cork> i would prob create an array of all the elements the first thing i do in the event handler
[09:25:50] <Cork> and then restructure it to be the "correct" order
[09:26:01] <Cork> and then loop over the array and set the index to the order on the element
[09:26:22] <Cork> how ever you do it will be messy though
[09:27:09] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/0a9x0yyy/18/
[09:33:42] <codecutter> Cork: did you manage to do it?
[09:34:54] <Cork> codecutter: haven't looked is a bit busy right now
[09:35:04] <codecutter> ok, nvm
[09:47:22] <Duikb00t> hi
[09:47:25] <Duikb00t> I tried using detach
[09:47:39] <Duikb00t> But without success I would like to remove a div and all other elements in that item.
[09:47:51] <Duikb00t> Not hiding, removing from the dom.
[09:48:01] <Cork> Duikb00t: if you just want it gone, just use .remove()
[09:48:13] <Cork> .detatch() is if you plan on attaching it again later
[09:48:17] <Duikb00t> oh
[09:53:17] <terens> Hello is there a way to bind data from json to html view ?
[09:53:26] <terens> without frameworks
[10:00:50] <PanicAtTheKernel> Why does $("#image") return a div with the id image, but also a div with a data-type="image"
[10:01:02] <PanicAtTheKernel> Shouldn't it only return the div id named image
[10:04:40] <codecutter> Cork: one more thing, how do I add text to the chart like you see here (notice the text that is in the center of the chart) http://picpaste.com/areaa-chart-8Yd2BNaN.png
[10:07:05] <codecutter> nvm
[10:07:20] <hlve> nvm
[10:16:27] <z1haze> what would the javascript equivalent of this be? `self.tool.children('.annotate-redo').attr('disabled', self.storedUndo.length === 0);` where self.tool is the jquery object
[12:49:28] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[12:49:42] <taplar> :)
[12:50:05] <taplar> everyone gets presidents day but us, :'(
[12:50:29] <taplar> and all the bots
[12:50:35] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:51:29] <hlve> I'll bot you.
[12:51:44] <taplar> mmm, you promise?
[12:51:54] <hlve> I wouldn't ever lie to you.
[12:52:03] <taplar> i've been hurt before
[12:53:45] <taplar> like saturday.  bestbuy cancelled my monitor order!  >:(
[12:55:06] <taplar> though that does remind me i wanted to see if pokemon was going to be on switch
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> whaaaaat?!
[12:56:04] <taplar> hmm?
[12:56:13] <robertmaxrees> they cancelled it?
[12:56:40] <taplar> yeah dude.  i ordered it wednesday, got a call on friday and saturday, answered it saturday and they said it was out of stock
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> fffff
[12:57:14] <taplar> so, guess newegg will get my $$$
[12:57:16] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[12:57:57] <taplar> to be fair, they did try to give me the same discount on another monitor i had been looking at, but yeah.  it takes 2 days to know something on your website is out of stock?
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised heh
[12:58:26] <taplar> i mean, i know, personally, keeping track of on hand can be a B, but damn
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that's pretty bad.
[12:59:18] <taplar> my inner conspiracist tells me they just didn't want to knock off the $200 for it so it's "out of stock"
[12:59:27] <hlve> lol
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:48:06] <monk12|2> hey all, quick question... I have a CORS web server and it responds to my Angular requests fine... now I created a standalone jquery page that responds to another endpoint on the system, but Im getting this error:
[13:48:10] <monk12|2> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://mydomain.com/api/getstudent?token=1231234. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Credentials flag is 'true', but the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header is ''. It must be 'true' to allow credentials. Origin 'http://mydomain.com' is therefore not allowed access.
[13:48:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean your server has cors enabled?
[13:49:00] <monk12|2> do i need that header? i don't think so since my other api endpoints work fine. this one endpoint is specifically for that standlaone getStudent endpoint...
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta satisfy the requirements of the request.
[13:50:48] <monk12|2> it does send back the headers for CORS: http://pastebin.com/y8NaniEP
[13:50:52] <monk12|2> from the java side.
[13:51:18] <monk12|2> and for OPTIONS request, stop processing since it doesn't need to enter any Controllers (just respond back and then allow the real POST/GET to come through)
[13:51:22] <taplar> typo on that header line?
[13:51:36] <taplar> looks like it's missing a closing ')'
[13:51:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too.
[13:51:52] <monk12|2> taplar: sorry i removed some code there
[13:52:25] <monk12|2> be4 pasting into pastebin. its fine/compiles. ) is there in real life (removed some comments and accidentally removed that ')' in my pastebin hehe)
[13:53:13] <monk12|2> Im just curious if "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true" is needed. my other CORS app says otherwise.
[13:53:17] <monk12|2> jquery sends over : xhrFields: { withCredentials: true }, headers: { 'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('user:pass') },
[13:53:43] <robertmaxrees> errm
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> monk12|2 it's saying that the flag is true but the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header is ''
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe your preflight requests aren't getting the right headers.
[13:54:38] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're setting those same headers for OPTIONS calls.
[13:54:43] <monk12|2> i don't even send it... commented out on that page... but it works without it for a CORS request to the same app (the angular app has a different endpoint, but this 'add CORS response' filter runs for all requests).
[13:55:21] * hlve slaps monk12|2 with a trout.
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're removing the credentials flag.
[13:55:27] <taplar> 'cors request to same app' ?
[13:55:47] <robertmaxrees> he probably means it's the same app with multiple endpoints that he's hitting via CORS.
[13:56:14] <taplar> just curious if he's thinking non-cors requests are 'working cors requests'
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> monk12|2 the error is literally that you have credentials set to true but that particular request is getting an empty value for "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" for that particular call.
[13:56:32] <monk12|2> robertmaxrees: correct. that header isn't needed for the angular requests to the same app (diff endpoint, same CORSFilter.java runs for all requests to the app)
[13:56:43] <robertmaxrees> gotta make sure you're setting headers correctly for GET, POST, and OPTIONS calls.
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> then something is inconsistent with your endpoints.
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> or your calls.
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> because your server isn't responding with the right 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' value
[13:57:26] <monk12|2> K. yah, i wonder how the angular app sends CORS requests over Basic Authentication without needing to return the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials. weird.
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> check the raw response headers.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> look to see if there's a difference.
[13:58:33] <monk12|2> I'll take a look at the link you sent. Thanks robertmaxrees. I'm enjoying that trout hlve :). I took a look at the headers in Network panel, but I'll double-check, maybe missed something
[13:59:03] <monk12|2> from jquery's end.... is it true Basic Authentication def needs withCredentials for jQuery?
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery issue from what i'm seeing.
[14:04:44] <robertmaxrees> the error is at the browser level.
[16:03:16] <php105> can anyone help me with this please? http://jsfiddle.net/qapv8kja/    notes are added in scipt
[16:04:26] <taplar> left/right arrows seem to work for me
[16:05:56] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[16:06:01] <php105> taplar: not when you type in there
[16:06:18] <taplar> ah
[16:06:18] <php105> but im trying to get numbers only
[16:06:22] <php105> =/
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> if (this.value.length == $(this).attr('maxlength')) { ?
[16:06:32] <php105> bit of a pig
[16:06:43] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing it.
[16:06:53] <taplar> check the key code in keyup or cancel it if you change focus so keyup isn't triggered
[16:07:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:08:03] <taplar> also, for readability sake, i often find some sort of object useful for this type of storage.  var Keys = { LEFT: 37, RIGHT: 39 }; and then if (e.keyCode === Keys.LEFT) ...   much more readable
[16:09:12] <php105> ok so i need to check keys on keyup and keydown?
[16:09:25] <taplar> or cancel the event if you change focus in keydown
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> they're separate handlers.
[16:10:01] <hlve> you're separate handlers
[16:11:19] <php105> could i do it under one handler?
[16:11:22] <php105> to minimize code
[16:12:11] <hlve> ooooof, taplar. I like that.
[16:12:28] <taplar> are you trying to restrict the input to digits only?
[16:12:32] <hlve> i didn't realize you could break that down like that.
[16:12:46] <taplar> yah, iirc, if you cancel the keydown, keyup will not fire
[16:12:54] <php105> taplar: yes
[16:13:05] <php105> taplar: only numbers 0-9
[16:13:46] <hlve> right, keyup follows keydown. if you unbind keydown, keyup never hits
[16:15:38] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that? ;)
[16:15:44] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gy4omuhg/
[16:16:00] <hlve> unbinding and preventdefault
[16:16:01] <hlve> are different
[16:16:09] <hlve> so yes, i'm sure about that lol
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> "unbind keydown"?
[16:16:19] <robertmaxrees> watr
[16:16:21] <robertmaxrees> *wat
[16:16:42] <hlve> .unbind('keydown');
[16:16:42] <hlve> yes
[16:16:50] <hlve> o_O
[16:16:55] <robertmaxrees> they keyup will still fire >.>
[16:17:10] <hlve> idk.
[16:17:21] <robertmaxrees> since they're two separate events.
[16:17:25] <php105> ok thank you
[16:17:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gy4omuhg/1/
[16:17:34] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:17:40] <hlve> ah
[16:17:43] <hlve> you're right
[16:17:45] <hlve> i'm dumbdumb
[16:17:48] <hlve> ignore me.
[16:17:51] * hlve goes away forever.
[16:18:46] <robertmaxrees> haha it's all good.
[16:18:54] <taplar> hmm
[16:20:13] <taplar> wonder what i'm thinking about
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:21:05] <taplar> could have swore that worked.
[16:32:44] <taplar> that's going to get more complicated though for the left and right check if your maxlength is ever > 1
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:33:08] <taplar> personally i'd just do the input check and let the users (shift) tab themselves
[16:33:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 the argument is that people want excel-style input.
[16:33:32] <robertmaxrees> which is lol
[16:33:54] <taplar> well i can see auto advancing them once they type the max chars, but that'd be as far as i'd go
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah pretty much.
[16:54:22] <php105> thank for your help guys
[16:54:23] <php105> http://jsfiddle.net/hj5zev9g/
[16:54:28] <php105> think i did it all now :)
[16:55:33] <taplar> what is line 15 doing?
[16:57:00] <hlve> something line 14 isn't.
[16:57:04] * hlve giggles
[16:57:30] <taplar> tru
[16:58:36] <hlve> enough sillyness for me.
[16:58:40] <hlve> have a goodnight, all
[17:06:15] <php105> ...?
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:15:05] <php105> im getting an error on previous.val().length
[17:15:53] <taplar> what's previous.length?
[17:16:27] <php105> http://jsfiddle.net/hj5zev9g/
[17:16:40] <php105> line 30
[17:16:48] <taplar> no, i mean, when you encounter that error
[17:16:54] <taplar> what is the actual value of previous.lengtH?
[17:17:22] <php105> value  length 0
[17:17:26] <php105> yes
[17:18:51] <taplar> not the value, the length of previous
[17:19:12] <taplar> if you're in the first element and you hit the left arrow there would not be any previous
[17:38:26] <php105> can someone tell me when using backspace it says length of input is 1? http://jsfiddle.net/hj5zev9g/1/
[17:38:31] <php105> in console
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> because there's one $(this)
[17:39:00] <taplar> keydown fires before the input is applied to the input field
[17:40:44] <php105> ummm how can i fix this please?
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to fix?
[17:41:37] <robertmaxrees> do you want the length of the input's value?
[17:43:29] <php105> yes please...if input has no value then i want to go back to prev input#
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> then get the lenght of the value.
[17:43:53] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the jquery object of the element itselfg.
[17:44:18] <robertmaxrees> could use this.value.lenth instead.
[17:47:50] <php105> robertmaxrees: thank you worked wonderfully
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> understand what the problem was?
[17:48:12] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/hj5zev9g/2/
[17:48:18] <php105> yes
[17:49:03] <php105> $(this) refering to .validation-pin basically..?
[17:49:42] <robertmaxrees> in an event handler, it's the jquery element that initiated the event.

[22:10:59] <jbu> Hi all, I'm trying to use jquery-ui's datepicker plugin.  The example shows to load the jquery-ui css and js files which are quite huge.  I would like to download just the subset of those files that are needed for the datepicker.  So I went to the CDN: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jqueryui/1.9.2 and picked out the datepicker.min.js/css files individually.
[22:11:02] <jbu> Loading my page, nothing happened, so I then <script> imported the jquery.ui.core.min.js file and now at least a SEMBLANCE of the datepicker appears.  So now my question is how do I know what the minimum set of jquery-ui files is that's necessary to show my individual component?
