[04:58:20] <tdev> Hello I'm new to jQuery and I'm trying to get a better understand of how to intercept this
[04:58:22] <tdev> https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c0ecb79ba2a6c4eff01f2ae9a59e3b6a9fdd4be1/assets/js/frontend/checkout.js#L469
[04:58:34] <tdev> as I would like to set it to false
[05:02:39] <Cork> bind a checkout_place_order event handler on the element $form and return false in it
[05:03:44] <tdev> thanks will try that now
[09:18:29] <tdev> how do I make sure that this is never fired in my own jQuery script for woocommerce please
[09:18:30] <tdev> https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c0ecb79ba2a6c4eff01f2ae9a59e3b6a9fdd4be1/assets/js/frontend/checkout.js#L35
[09:37:39] <Cork> tdev: you mean you want to prevent your submit handler from catching that form?
[09:38:02] <Cork> or you want to prevent that form event handler from fireing for a specific form?
[09:43:16] <Clex> Hi! Is there an XSS with $("input[name='" + foo + "']")?
[09:53:16] <Cork> Clex: not very but if you really care you can do $('input').filter(function() { return this.name == foo; })
[09:53:23] <tdev> I   want to prevent that form event handler from fireing for a specific form in order to bind my handler
[09:53:38] <tdev> or fire mine whatever is easier
[09:53:54] <Cork> tdev: you would have to prevent it from binding with checkout_form or monky patch the plugin
[09:54:02] <Clex> Cork: that looks better indeed, thanks.
[09:54:33] <tdev> jesus christ I knew it and I lost four days I guess I learned jQuery so it's cool
[09:54:39] <tdev> thanks a lot
[09:54:53] <Cork> Clex: it might also be .filder(function(elm) { return elm.name == foo; }) i never remember what function sets this and who doesn't
[09:55:09] <Cork> .filter*
[10:00:54] <Clex> Cork: 'k, I'll check
[15:51:22] <snatcher> there $obj1, $obj2, $obj3, $obj4 ... is there a way to combine different jquery objects into jquery object? $([$obj2, $obj4]) doesn't work
[15:55:45] <makr8100> myArrayOfObjects = []; myArrayOfObjects.push($obj2); myArrayOfObjects.push($obj4);
[15:56:32] <snatcher> makr8100: need jquery object with jquery objects not an array
[15:57:41] <snatcher> $([$obj2[0], $obj4[0]]) also doesn't work if any object returns undefined
[16:01:05] <snatcher> in my case have multiple jquery objects [$obj1, $obj2, $obj3, $obj4, ...] and want to apply different jquery object methods on different combinations of them, $([$obj2, $obj4]).someJqueryObjectMethod(); $([$obj1, $obj3]).someJqueryObjectMethod(); ... is it possible?
[16:02:42] <shoky_> snatcher:  $obj1.add($obj2).add($obj3)
[16:03:34] <shoky_> can also .add($obj2, $obj3, ...)
[16:04:39] <shoky_> actually not sure you can do the multiple args one with jquery objects
[19:19:25] <impliednude> I need to convert some jquery to vanilla js. plain boring, etc.. Anyone have any resources? the code I am dealing with is very simple.
[19:21:12] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/t953njk6/ anyone mind assisting pretty please? ^_^
[19:25:21] <Feldmaus> document.querySelector() and elem.innerHTML = ... is what you need
[19:28:42] <impliednude> what about keyup event monitoring?
[19:32:30] <shoky_> impliednude:  document.querySelector(...).addEventListener('keyup', (e) => { const v = e.target.value; })
[19:32:38] <shoky_> impliednude: http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
[19:37:53] <impliednude> shoky_> I dont need jquery, I need the equiv without having to get a CE to do so -laughs-
[19:38:16] <dw1> that wasnt jquery
[19:38:20] <dw1> that was vanilla
[19:39:05] <impliednude> that is vanilla, just saying. I wish there was a method of taking simple code like my example and generating vanilla js
[19:39:38] <dw1> find & replace
[19:39:41] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:39:49] * impliednude eyerolls
[19:40:09] <dw1> might be a script around somewhere
[19:40:11] <dw1> if not it's up to you
[19:41:08] <shoky_> impliednude: you asked for resources for converting jquery to vanilla js. that is exactly what the link i gave you is
[19:41:22] <shoky_> i never said you need jquery
