[00:01:37] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: hash is c or ruby or python it is objects in js
[00:01:59] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: to answer the question you have to create a new object and copy over the key+values you want
[00:02:22] <Cork> actually are you sure you asked that in the wrong channel?
[00:02:29] <Cork> that looks like ruby to me
[00:03:37] <IPhoton> I have a question for jquery mobile if anyone has access here. I want to know how to create a home button on top nav so it always points to the homepage
[00:03:50] <IPhoton> not in a regular server, but as a phone app in webview
[00:04:03] <IPhoton> I know you how to do it in regular href
[00:12:57] <jumanji> hi guys how do I look for an xpath in each xpath evaluation? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25441401/javascript-look-for-xpath-inside-element
[00:23:21] <Greener> Where "ui" is a .draggable() element, what does $(ui.draggable) mean? As far as I know .draggable isn't a property of ui, the way that "helper" might be. I don't understand the code but it's the only thing that works.
[00:57:57] <xec> Greener: are you sure that the "ui" is an element?
[00:59:51] <Greener> I'm not 100% sure of what it is, no
[01:00:00] <Greener> http://i.gyazo.com/fc0cffb85b59499a16e79c6168f1f216.png <--- console output of "event" and "ui"
[01:00:17] <xec> Greener: it's quite common (and done so in the examples) to have "ui" be the name of the second parameter of callbacks
[01:01:47] <Greener> I don't really know what that is, but that's google fodder for tomorrow
[01:02:02] <Greener> As long as I'm not missing some part of the api, that's good enough for now
[01:12:03] <xec> Greener: if you show us your whole code (preferably in a working state at jsfiddle.net) it might be easier to tell what you're trying to do
[01:12:17] <Greener> Will do
[01:12:26] <Greener> It does work, I just don't know why :)
[01:13:27] <xec> in the image you posted, i don't see any parameter on the second object named "draggable" so i'm guessing it's used in another context
[01:17:43] <kk1> has anyone used dform here?
[01:18:31] <xec> kk1: maybe, but you're much more likely to get a response if you ask a full question and a demo to look at ;)
[01:19:43] <kk1> xec: sure
[01:20:08] <kk1> xec: i was looking for if someone has extended it to use javascript validation function
[01:25:30] <Greener> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/vz6pcdy8/
[01:30:47] <emx> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ <-- it says that "As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated;"
[01:31:01] <emx> is async: false in general deprecated?
[01:31:12] <emx> or only when used with this $.Deferred?
[01:31:18] <Cork> it is depricated in the dom platform
[01:31:29] <Cork> no new features is added to sync xhr
[01:31:54] <Cork> and it is a VERY BAD idea to use it
[01:32:12] <Cork> and you should structure your site to work with async instead
[01:32:21] <emx> errr. lammy just PMed me this: show gratis (solo hooy) --> http://s422803032.mialojamiento.es/
[01:32:27] <m3th0d> mornin
[01:32:35] <Greener> I didn't mention that earlier but I got the same PM
[01:32:40] <Cork> emx: report it to #freenode
[01:32:41] <Greener> No idea who to report that to
[01:33:23] <Cork> emx: also you can do /mode <your nick> +R to not have to bother
[01:33:30] <Cork> and not things won't happen
[01:33:48] <slax0r> o.O
[01:33:56] <Cork> we've gotten a lot of those spammers lately
[01:34:10] <slax0r> oh, so I get those from this chan?
[01:34:15] <Cork> no
[01:34:19] <Cork> you get those from a user in the chan
[01:34:29] <Cork> it monitors joins and sends the pm
[01:34:40] <xec> Greener: http://jsfiddle.net/vz6pcdy8/1/
[01:35:05] <emx> Cork, so in short: don't use async: false..
[01:35:11] <Cork> emx: yes
[01:35:16] <emx> Cork, k, thanks
[01:35:28] <slax0r> Cork: yes, ofc from a user in this chan :)
[01:35:29] <Cork> emx: async: false will frees the page
[01:35:33] <xec> Greener: if you look at the console, it looks like the .draggable is some sort of collection containing the <p>
[01:35:50] <Cork> emx: and in some situations the entire browser
[01:36:07] <emx> Cork, thought so.
[01:36:10] <Cork> emx: and it will stay like that until the connection gets an answer or times out (BAD user experience)
[01:36:28] <xec> i.e. the draggable element (and "ui" is just a container object)
[01:36:35] <Cork> so ya, async: false is the lazy developers way out
[01:36:40] <Cork> with no real excuse
[01:36:44] <Greener> I guess that's that, then. Thanks a bunch. No idea where that's documented though.
[01:37:26] <Cork> emx: $.ajax().done().fail().always() means you can almost always handle this without the need for sync ajax
[01:37:27] <xec> Greener: http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop
[01:37:53] <Cork> (without much code change that is)
[01:38:08] <MrTopless> Hey, how to pass what $('element').html(function(/*How to put html return here?*/){});
[01:38:15] <Greener> I'm still tripped up by how printing the ui itself to the console doesn't show ui.draggable
[01:38:30] <Greener> I'm not new to programming but am very new to JS
[01:38:31] <Cork> MrTopless:  $('element').html((function(/*How to put html return here?*/){})());
[01:38:57] <Cork> well not in the argument
[01:39:02] <xec> Greener: it does, but only inside the drop event
[01:39:05] <Cork> MrTopless:  $('element').html((function(){ /*How to put html return here?*/ })());
[01:39:14] <Greener> Ohhhhhhhh
[01:39:25] <Greener> Got it
[01:39:34] <emx> Cork, i can handle async calls. but a coworker wants me to change a plugin in a way that would require sync ajax calls. now i know i don't have to make the effort :)
[01:39:37] <MrTopless> Cork, so how to put .html returned value inside function variable, so I could use it in funcion?
[01:39:47] <Greener> Thanks a ton xec
[01:39:53] <Cork> emx: :)
[01:39:54] <xec> Greener: also, the ui.draggable is already a jquery object, so no need to wrap it in $()
[01:40:01] <shoky> .html can take a function too  .html(function(i, oldHtml) { return ... })
[01:40:02] <Greener> Noted
[01:40:05] <xec> Greener: just do ui.draggable.clone()
[01:40:22] <Cork> MrTopless: you mean you want to send the html from the element into the inline function=
[01:40:24] <Cork> *?
[01:40:31] <MrTopless> Cork, yes :-)
[01:40:52] <Cork> MrTopless: (function(html){ alert(html); })($('element').html());
[01:41:16] <MrTopless> Cork, thanx, where can I read about this?
[01:41:34] <Cork> MrTopless: donno it is quite simple it is a self execution function declaration
[01:41:50] <shoky> MrTopless if you want to use it to then set the html with .html()  then you can use what i wrote above.  http://api.jquery.com/html/#html-function
[01:41:54] <Cork> (function(html) {})(input); is the same as
[01:42:09] <Cork> var something = function(html) {}; something(input);
[01:42:42] <MrTopless> Cork, how can I figure out names of variables which are returned from function, without looking at jquery lib?
[01:46:05] <MrTopless> Cork, it says undefined var. So html doesn't work.
[01:46:34] <MrTopless> it means .html(), doesn't return variable called html, which can be used to modify returned element.
[01:50:07] <sacho_> you cannot return variables.
[01:50:58] <sacho_> functions return values.
[02:01:12] <MrTopless> How to pass .html() returned data into inline function?
[02:02:59] <MrTopless> shoky, thanx, skipped that. Will try it out :-)
[02:05:28] <mjsey89> Hi all
[02:06:26] <MrTopless> shoky, I've tried function(index, oldHtml), function(htmlString), well it returns Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[02:06:47] <MrTopless> jQuery('.main-thumbnail').html(function(htmlString){ return htmlString.css({'width':'150px !important','height':'150px !important'}); });
[02:08:44] <hackal> Hello I have simple navigation http://jsfiddle.net/zvcdyfpm/. I would like to have children items hidden and when clicked on parent they would be slide down. please could you point me what functions should I use?
[02:10:20] <Lindrain> I'm having a bit of a problem with jquery. I want to get the offset of an element, but there are a bunch of elements that are hidden above it
[02:10:30] <Lindrain> how do I make jquery disregard those when calculating the offset?
[02:10:35] <Jattenalle> MrTopless, that's not how you'd do that
[02:10:58] <Jattenalle> MrTopless, to apply CSS you'd just do:  jQuery('.main-thumbnail').css({
[02:13:13] <mjsey89> Im having trouble with nested lists for a menu, I've managed to get it to work that the parent list elements hide when the next parent is clicked but if that parent has sub menu it also hides
[02:13:15] <mjsey89> http://jsfiddle.net/h287a8b5/1/
[02:14:49] <MrTopless> Jattenall,e that not I want to do. I want to get that html into variable, leave original as it is and keep modified one in variable for use in other function.
[02:14:59] <MrTopless> Jattenalle, that not I want to do. I want to get that html into variable, leave original as it is and keep modified one in variable for use in other function.
[02:15:22] <Jattenalle> that's not how you'd do that
[02:15:33] <Jattenalle> var stuff = $('wahtever').html();
[02:15:39] <Jattenalle> $(stuff).css(wahtever);
[02:15:41] <Jattenalle> is what you want
[02:15:56] <MrTopless> oh thats my problem :-)
[02:16:01] <MrTopless> I forgot to add $()
[02:16:08] <Jattenalle> no... read the code
[02:16:10] <MrTopless> I though variable already has those inside
[02:16:26] <MrTopless> thought*
[02:18:48] <MrTopless> Jatenalle, when I do:'...' + $(productImg).css({'width':'150px','height':'150px'}) + '...'; I get this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'css' of null
[02:19:11] <MrTopless> Should I use width() and Height() instead?
[02:19:24] <Jattenalle> i have no idea what you're trying to do
[02:19:56] <decx> is that css() in a string?
[02:20:01] <decx> now i've seen it all
[02:20:03] <MrTopless> I'm trying to resize thumbnail which is 68x68 in its original container, but original image size is 6 times larger, so I want to set it bigger
[02:20:20] <MrTopless> For display in WindowBox
[02:20:25] <decx> just means that productImg doesnt exisat
[02:21:04] <MrTopless> decx I've used this as example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16086201/jquery-changing-style-of-html-element
[02:21:09] <Cork> decx: no .css shouldn't throw exceptions from that
[02:21:17] <MrTopless> decx it exists if I don't use .css
[02:21:40] <Cork> decx: $(null).css('width', 1); works just fine ;(
[02:21:42] <Cork> *;)
[02:21:55] <systemfault> jQuery is possibly not loaded.
[02:22:05] <Cork> or it isn't jquery
[02:22:06] <Jattenalle> it is, but not as $
[02:22:07] <decx> oh, right
[02:22:41] <Jattenalle> i'm givng up though, call me pissy, but i dont have the time to teach someone basic fundamental programming logic, like "how do you return a variable?"
[02:22:43] * Jattenalle sighs
[02:22:58] <systemfault> Jattenalle: How do I return a variable? PLZ
[02:23:17] <Jattenalle> systemfault, deltree system32 | y

[02:24:08] <decx> Jattenalle i load html with ajax and my buttons don't work anymore :(
[02:24:12] <systemfault> Cork: Hmm, I won't try it, you're probably lying like Jattenalle !
[02:24:23] <Jattenalle> decx, hey now, i do that, and my buttons work :3
[02:24:36] <Cork> systemfault: if your on a moderately modern linux kernel that kommand will be blocked ^^
[02:24:54] <systemfault> Cork: I'm on osx... so I don't know if it has --preserve-root
[02:24:58] <Cork> ah

[02:29:02] <stephan> hi
[02:29:15] <stephan> anyone has experience with WebServices/SOAP?
[02:29:24] <Cork> ?ask
[02:29:25] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:29:44] <stephan> by easy words what is WSI standard?
[02:31:37] <Cork> stephan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Interoperability
[02:31:45] <stephan> Cork: :]
[02:33:39] <systemfault> People still use SOAP? :P
[02:34:05] <pragma-> I hope so.
[02:34:08] <Cork> systemfault: sadly they do
[02:34:23] <Cork> makes me cry everytime i have to use it though
[02:34:37] <stephan> Cork: me too:(
[02:36:45] <MrTopless> Cork, Jattenalle, decx, figure it out, its old jquery. It uses jQuery instead of $
[02:37:19] <Cork> MrTopless: that isn't old just either something else is using $ or you load jquery with noConflict()
[02:37:37] <MrTopless> Cork, got it.
[02:37:41] <shoky> MrTopless: you're also including prototype lib which overwrites $
[02:38:00] <MrTopless> got it
[02:38:08] <MrTopless> thanx
[02:38:16] <Cork> ya, prototype loves exceptions
[02:38:36] <Cork> used it before jquery was a thing (hated it)
[02:39:18] <stephan> if i wanna get some elements by other page and process them should i use only curl and php (or other server-side language)? there is nothing more JS-like or jquery-like?
[02:39:47] <Cork> stephan: client side can't do it as browsers will block it
[02:39:59] <Cork> your only option client side is <iframe>
[02:40:15] <Cork> well or <object> or <frame>
[02:40:29] <stephan> but i don't want to show website in website but get some data from html from other side.
[02:40:47] <Cork> ya, then you can only access it if the remove server explicitly allows it
[02:41:19] <mooncup> morning
[02:41:21] <stephan> you talking about ajax here, right?
[02:41:38] <mooncup> how do I change the GET parameter used for AJAX autocompletes?
[02:41:41] <mooncup> It's defaulting to "term"
[02:42:08] <Cork> mooncup: you can't
[02:42:18] <mooncup> you used to be able to :<
[02:42:21] <Cork> you would have to use a source function and do your own ajax call
[02:42:49] <mooncup> yeah I was thinking about that
[02:42:54] <Cork> source: function(request, response) { $.ajax(url, { /* your options*/ }).done(response); }
[02:42:54] <mooncup> seems like such overkill though
[02:42:59] <mooncup> I'll change it on the serverside instead
[02:43:00] <mooncup> thanks!
[02:43:10] <Cork> mooncup: it is not really overkill
[02:43:17] <Cork> it leaves the most flexibility
[02:43:23] <Cork> and it isn't really much code
[02:43:59] <mooncup> blergh
[02:44:09] <mooncup> does autocomplete call that function anyway if you set an ajax source?
[02:44:29] <Cork> mooncup: you set the function instead of the source url
[02:44:44] <Cork> "url" in the ajax call shoulbe be where you set the source address
[02:44:46] <mooncup> yeah I know that
[02:44:52] <mooncup> I was wondering about how jquery handles it internally
[02:45:06] <mooncup> when I say "that function" I mean $.ajax
[02:45:08] <Cork> if(typeof(source) == 'string')
[02:45:09] <mooncup> not my anonymous function
[02:45:16] <Cork> if(typeof(source) == 'function')
[02:45:20] <Cork> and so on
[02:45:25] <mooncup> ah fair enough
[02:45:31] <mooncup> so I'm actually speeding things up technically
[02:45:32] <mooncup> woop
[02:45:51] <Cork> mooncup: not really
[02:45:51] <mooncup> thanks Cork
[02:46:00] <mooncup> just let me have this one :(
[02:46:00] <Cork> it should be same speed as before
[02:46:11] <Cork> you just replace its built in ajax call with your own
[02:46:39] <shoky> there might be a nanosecond difference, and it MIGHT be in mooncup's favor. so there.
[02:47:05] <Cork> lol
[02:47:28] <shoky> :x
[02:47:34] <mooncup> that's what I wanted to hear!
[02:47:51] <Uhkis> lol
[02:48:38] <Cork> mooncup: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/autocomplete.js#L365
[02:49:08] <Cork> as long as your function is more efficient then line 375 you will save time ;P
[02:49:16] <mooncup> well would you look at that
[02:49:29] <Cork> (function is line 392)
[02:50:42] <Cork> mooncup: so { data: { my_prop: request.term } }
[02:52:29] <mooncup> thanks very much
[02:52:37] <mooncup> you've put my mind at ease
[02:53:02] <mooncup> I can sleep happy tonight knowing I didn't add 0.001s overhead to my application
[02:53:16] <Uhkis> that's a millisecond
[02:54:08] <mooncup> those milliseconds add up!
[02:54:10] <Uhkis> nano second is million times less ;-)
[02:57:03] <mooncup> hm does javascript not allow you to create objects from other object values?
[02:57:08] <mooncup> apparently this isn't valid:
[02:57:09] <mooncup> drawAttendees({ ui.item['id'] : ui.item['name'] });
[03:10:40] <shoky> mooncup: right you can't do it with an object literal. only:  var obj = {};  obj[ ui.item['id'] ] = ui.item['name'];
[03:14:10] <davlefou> hi,
[03:15:19] <davlefou> How i can do an reccurence with each?  http://pastebin.com/jfGZbpt7
[03:20:47] <bkhl> What is the best practice for getting the resolve arguments from the Deferreds to $.when() inside the handlers?
[03:21:35] <bkhl> s/Deferreds to/Deferreds given as arguments to/
[03:23:59] <sacho_> $.when(promise1, promise2).then(function success(value1, value2) {})
[03:24:33] <sacho_> not sure what you're really asking for
[03:25:16] <mooncup> yeah thanks shoky
[03:49:46] <rajlaksh> I need help
[03:50:16] <rajlaksh> This code does not work inside .js file jQuery( document ).ready(function() { alert( "ready!" ); });
[03:50:37] <Cork> rajlaksh: more context needed
[03:50:46] <Cork> 1. is jquery added to the page?
[03:51:08] <rajlaksh> but it work with without document ready :)
[03:51:12] <Cork> 2. is jquery loade BEFORE the js resource you have this written in?
[03:51:49] <rajlaksh> 1. Jquery loaded
[03:52:09] <rajlaksh> 2. jquery loaded before that js file :)
[03:52:19] <Cork> rajlaksh: you have a link?
[03:52:25] <rajlaksh> localhost
[03:52:47] <Cork> check your browsers console for errors
[03:52:58] <Cork> it's basically the only tip i can give you
[03:52:58] <rajlaksh> no error shows
[03:53:27] <rajlaksh> console.log print nothing when i add it in document ready
[03:53:46] <Cork> cause the code isn't executing at all for some reason
[03:54:08] <Cork> ex. check that the resource is requested and loaded
[03:54:17] <rajlaksh> But without document ready console.log works :)
[03:54:48] <rajlaksh> var $j = jQuery;
[03:55:00] <Cork> only thing one might get from that is 1. jquery fails to load 2. you have syntax error or 3. something your not mentioning is failing
[03:55:12] <Cork> so ya, to little into to tell
[03:56:07] <rajlaksh> My is this http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[03:57:10] <rajlaksh> here is code $( document ).ready(function() { console.log( "ready!" ); });
[03:57:25] <rajlaksh> $ is replaced with $j
[03:57:39] <rajlaksh> because $ is not a Function WP
[04:00:04] <Uhkis> could those whitespaces generate something weird?
[04:00:17] <Uhkis> chaninii is a new spam bot btw
[04:11:00] <MrTopless> Cork, maybe you can help me track down "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token } " at http://www.boomerangz.eu/catalog/product/view/id/18/s/toeless-yoga-tabi-socks/category/11/?___store=en&___from_store=lt because Console show error at <head> or <Doctype>
[04:11:16] <MrTopless> And there is no javascript
[04:11:25] <MrTopless> and all javascript is wrapped in docmuent ready
[04:11:34] <MrTopless> It happends on notify me click event
[04:12:33] <Cork> i don't get it
[04:12:40] <Cork> MrTopless: try clearing your cache
[04:12:54] <MrTopless> Cashe of broser?
[04:12:57] <Cork> yes
[04:12:59] <MrTopless> Try subscribing
[04:13:05] <MrTopless> i turned off cache
[04:13:20] <MrTopless> on chrome via network
[04:13:31] <Cork> no error
[04:16:57] <MrTopless> have you sbuscribed?
[04:17:10] <MrTopless> +did you got success message?
[04:18:32] <adamski2600> Can anyone point me in a good direction for creating a plugin?
[04:20:20] <MrTopless> Cork, you have to press Bring it back
[04:20:22] <MrTopless> then notify me
[04:20:41] <MrTopless> notify me doesn't submit ajaxForm
[04:20:51] <MrTopless> because it gets unexpected token }
[04:21:25] <Cork> MrTopless: your evaling js somewhere
[04:21:53] <MrTopless> Cork, what does that mean?
[04:22:08] <Cork> your doing eval on a string to execute js in the string
[04:22:27] <Cork> that is why you get the problem in locating the code
[04:22:33] <Cork> cause it is on line 11 in the string
[04:22:35] <thaifood> hi Cork  happy Friday
[04:22:39] <Cork> and you have no file to reference
[04:22:47] <Cork> thaifood: heh, thx the same ^^̈́
[04:23:21] <Cork> MrTopless: are you using something like require.js?
[04:25:45] <MrTopless> Cork, list of scripts: http://pastebin.com/XgVwbDs2
[04:26:04] <Cork> ya, i see that list from the site
[04:26:34] <Cork> but yes eval is evil among other things for this reason
[04:26:39] <Cork> it is really hard to debug it
[04:27:48] <phoenixsun> I am getting a 'cannot call methods on autocomplete prior to initialisation error' . Not sure how to tackle it.
[04:28:40] <murosai> does anyone know if i use jquery selectmenu how can i add .data() to select options?
[04:28:41] <Cork> phoenixsun: your giving autocomplete a string instead of an object
[04:29:20] <phoenixsun> Cork: I thought everything in jQuery was a object. Guess not
[04:29:24] <Cork> MrTopless: my tip is to rip out script references one at at time
[04:29:33] <Cork> and then check if the error goes away
[04:29:36] <MrTopless> ok
[04:29:38] <Cork> to locate where it comes from
[04:29:53] <Cork> phoenixsun: kinda but not really
[04:30:07] <Cork> what i meant with the comment before was
[04:30:26] <Cork> initializing autocomplete expects to get nothing or { option: value }
[04:30:46] <Cork> if it gets a string it expects to be method calls on the autocomplete plugin
[04:31:12] <Cork> this is how all widget factory plugins work (the entire ui is build ontop of widget factory)
[04:33:37] <phoenixsun> Cork: so if I do want to pass a string to it. Do I (a) find some way of wrapping to string into an object or … actually even if  make a function and that function accepts a string and returns it. its the same problem.
[04:33:59] <Cork> phoenixsun: what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:34:15] <Cork> cause that question doesn't really make sense
[04:34:46] <phoenixsun> Cork: use a string as a data source for the autocomplete widget, indirectly if needed.
[04:34:59] <phoenixsun> an array/string
[04:35:12] <Cork> phoenixsun: then you would have to give it as a source
[04:35:17] <Cork> not an option
[04:35:25] <Cork> ?g api jquery ui autocomplete source
[04:35:27] <b-ot> Cork: Autocomplete Widget | jQuery UI API Documentation → http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[04:35:37] <phoenixsun> I am on there already
[04:36:15] <Cork> then you might be better served by the examples here http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[04:45:53] <Kikokimo> Hello, does anybody knows how to get the datePicker to work correctly in a modal ?
[04:46:19] <Uhkis> how is it not working correctly?
[04:54:32] <qq_> is any one there??
[04:54:46] <qq_> need help for ajax process
[04:55:26] <bl4ckdu51> qq_: what is the problem exactly?
[04:55:39] <Cork> ?ask
[04:55:42] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:55:44] <bl4ckdu51> /names makes you know if anyone is here
[04:56:16] <qq_> i am using two function for some process
[04:56:34] <qq_> both fn work together
[04:57:06] <qq_> but i want after complete ajax response second fn is working  but currently both fn working
[04:57:25] <Cork> qq_: "working"?
[04:57:37] <Cork> you mean it executes?
[04:57:53] <Cork> actually i think you need to make a fiddle
[04:57:56] <Cork> ?p
[04:57:59] <Cork> `p
[04:58:02] <Cork> ?paste
[04:58:03] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:58:31] <qq_> my query is that how can i hold second function untill first function send sucess response
[04:59:15] <qq_> let see my code
[04:59:15] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com $.when
[04:59:16] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.when() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[04:59:38] <qq_> can i paste my code here
[04:59:40] <qq_> ??
[04:59:44] <Cork> not directly no
[04:59:52] <Cork> use the fiddle link b-ot linked to
[05:00:05] <Cork> and paste the link here
[05:01:23] <qq_> ok
[05:01:25] <qq_> http://fixee.org/paste/0af1yqe/
[05:01:31] <qq_> plz see my cide
[05:02:18] <Cork> so you want CheckGeneratedForms to wait for ProcessAjax?
[05:02:26] <qq_> yes
[05:02:49] <Cork> your calling it in success
[05:02:52] <Cork> that should work
[05:03:17] <Cork> but your checking for return values from CheckGeneratedForms in there
[05:03:23] <Cork> and that WON'T work
[05:03:41] <Cork> ajax is async
[05:03:53] <Cork> so return will always execute before the success callback
[05:04:04] <Cork> so bool will always be "undefined"
[05:04:15] <Cork> instead do return $.ajax
[05:04:23] <Cork> and in ProcessAjax
[05:04:39] <Cork> hmm
[05:04:39] <Cork> no
[05:04:48] <Cork> one min
[05:07:22] <qq_> so plz tell me what need to change in code for excute properly
[05:08:11] <Cork> something like this http://fixee.org/paste/0af1yqe/#pasteEdit=&url=ys8ywtr
[05:09:17] <Cork> qq_: basically the problem is you relied on return from an ajax call, and that doesn't work
[05:09:35] <qq_> thanx
[05:09:39] <qq_> let me try
[05:09:58] <Cork> the code is completely untested so it might have typos or bugs or what not
[05:10:04] <Cork> but the basic idea should work
[05:11:00] <Cork> qq_: also you need to understand what the code does
[05:11:04] <Cork> and not just copy cat it
[05:11:43] <qq_> ok
[05:22:47] <phoenixsun> Cork: I think the autocomplete is working now cos its adjusting the div size when I type. I just can't see anything. I have tried '.ui-autocomplete; z-index: 444 !Important;' that didn't work
[05:23:37] <Cork> phoenixsun: make sure the source matches what autocomplete expects
[05:24:20] <phoenixsun> that is matches but I senses its a styling or z-index issue now
[05:24:34] <ggt> With jquery ui, how can we get hold of object where tab is created?
[05:25:16] <Cork> ggt: you mean for the tabs plugin?
[05:25:41] <Cork> tabs('widget') should get you somewhere there and then you most likely have to do the rest manually
[05:29:01] <ggt> Cork  , yes tab plubin.  how do i use tabs('widget')  ?
[05:29:08] <ggt> plugin*
[05:29:22] <Cork> ggt: all ui plugins have a widget method
[05:29:35] <Cork> if you call it it will give you the outer widget element
[05:29:48] <slax0r> Cork: personal question, feel free to tell me to shove it, but, how on earth do you get any work done, if you're constantly helping others? :)
[05:29:53] <ggt> but which object should i rn it upon?
[05:29:58] <ggt> run*
[05:30:06] <Cork> slax0r: multitasking?
[05:30:18] <slax0r> I can't code and help someone out with their code
[05:30:23] <Cork> ggt: the element you ran .tabs on by default
[05:30:40] <Cork> slax0r: i do go silent from time to time
[05:30:45] <Cork> when i hit comlicated parts
[05:30:51] <ggt> cork - but that is the problem. I need to find which element "owns" the tab
[05:31:11] <Cork> ggt: i don't really follow
[05:31:52] <ggt> I have this page. I want to remove tabs on that page. I don't which element the tab was created upon. How can I find it ? (for a browser userscript)
[05:32:53] <ggt> s/I don't /I don't  know/
[05:32:57] <MrTopless> fixed it
[05:32:57] <Cork> ggt: just search the code tree for the .tabs( line
[05:33:14] <ggt> How can we find this through code?
[05:33:48] <MrTopless> Cork, fixed it, instead of ajaxForm, used jQuery.ajax and called it by jQuery.on('click','#submitbutton',function() {}) event. :-)
[05:33:52] <Cork> ggt: you would find what initiates the plugin
[05:34:11] <Cork> MrTopless: so the problem was in ajaxForm?
[05:35:03] <MrTopless> Cork, not yet sure it used to work before I've made code changes, but I think it wasn't ajaxForm, it was the method I pass form from variable to html.
[05:35:37] <MrTopless> So I didn't change the method, but specified elements.
[05:35:47] <Cork> well as long as it works
[05:36:41] <ggt> Cork:how? There must be some way we can test if an element has been "used" in creating a jquery tab?
[05:39:14] <MrTopless> Maybe if I would check if that variable is I don't know how its called.
[05:39:14] <Cork> ggt: not that i know of no
[05:39:36] <MrTopless> How event is called, when data from variable is loaded into html?
[05:39:40] <MrTopless> And how to check that?
[05:39:46] <Cork> ggt: you MIGHT be able to do something horrible like looping through the entire data cache in jquery
[05:39:56] <Cork> and check if any of them points to tabs
[05:40:11] <Cork> and then find the element identified by that extando
[05:41:05] <Cork> jQuery.cache <-- cache
[05:41:32] <MrTopless> If that condition is satisfied and key from that printed form is clicked after the form is printed, to do ajaxForm function.
[05:41:54] <MrTopless> Cork, how to check if html from variable is printed?
[05:42:04] <Cork> MrTopless: no events are fired when you parse html
[05:42:37] <Cork> basically the code adding it would have to fire a fake event if you want one
[05:42:38] <MrTopless> So its not recommended to parse forms from variables?
[05:42:59] <Cork> sure it is
[05:43:05] <Cork> you just won't get events for it
[05:43:32] <MrTopless> And how to cause fake event?
[05:43:59] <Cork> $(target).trigger('the-event-name-you-want-to-create')
[05:44:10] <MrTopless> Cork, nice. :_)
[05:44:39] <Cork> though often a callback or something not dom related
[05:44:51] <Cork> is the correct way to handle logic communication
[05:44:53] <Cork> and not events
[05:45:08] <Cork> events is to allow code parts that knows nothing about each other to talk
[05:46:32] <MrTopless> Cork, okay, so how to listen for that event?
[05:46:42] <Cork> like any other event
[06:34:16] <BillCriswell> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvmT5VXIMAAf_bF.jpg:large lol
[06:39:58] <Cork> BillCriswell: lol nice XD
[06:42:56] <phoenixsun> it the best method of reading JSON into one's JS using xmlhttp?
[06:43:35] <Cork> phoenixsun: if you mean what is, then just make the ajax call
[06:43:36] <phx> if you just want to parse a text into a structure then eval('('+jsonstring+')') does the job
[06:43:43] <Cork> and have the server send the correct json back
[06:43:57] <Cork> phx: euh...
[06:44:02] <Cork> just use JSON.parse()
[06:44:06] <Cork> why evil...
[06:44:10] <phx> sorry, i wasn't aware of that one
[06:44:58] <phoenixsun> first I will get the JSON loaded then next is the parsing :)
[06:45:18] <Cork> phoenixsun: are you using $.ajax?
[06:45:55] <Cork> cause if you do just send the correct content-type and you will get parsed json
[06:46:02] <Cork> no manual parsing needed
[06:46:14] <phoenixsun> Cork: I was trying to implement it using xmlhttp but it seemed long winded so I am going to try ajax now
[06:46:51] <Cork> $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { alert(data.keyInJson) });
[06:46:55] <Cork> done :)
[06:46:57] <systemfault> phoenixsun: So... instead of ajax, you're going to use ajax? :P
[06:48:46] <phoenixsun> ok my terminology have been lacking a little bit
[06:48:49] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody, i'm getting a weird issue with ajax and jquery, the request (xhr) argument into the ajax, if I do xhr.getResponseHeader() is returning me text/html instead application/json, but If I inspect the headers given by the server, it returns me as content-type: application/json why jquery.ajax is converting that request into text/html ?
[06:49:02] <phoenixsun> I am guessing that both methods fall under the same umbrelaa
[06:49:21] <Cork> Germanaz0: you have a link?
[06:49:31] <Germanaz0> no, its on localhost
[06:50:00] <Cork> Germanaz0: i can only gess, but i would expect the header to be wrong in some way
[06:50:12] <Germanaz0> the problem is that the function gives me text/html instead application/json
[06:50:22] <Cork> what function?
[06:50:55] <Germanaz0> xhr.getResponseHeader("content-type")
[06:51:10] <Cork> and what does Content-Type give you?
[06:51:16] <thaifood> Any ideas why IE9 with jQuery 2.1.1 says:  Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener'   my site works fine in IE10, chrome and FF
[06:51:32] <Germanaz0> using this  xhr.getResponseHeader("content-type") return text/html; charset=ut-8 and with curl, returns the application/json
[06:51:35] <Cork> thaifood: most likely cause your site runs in compatibility mode
[06:51:39] <DarsVaeda> I have a form with two submit buttons, I need to differentiate on click which one was used to submit the form, what is the best practice on this?
[06:51:41] <thaifood> it is not
[06:51:53] <thaifood> if you mean the button in the address bar
[06:52:09] <DarsVaeda> have a click handler on the buttons and submit the form with the click?
[06:52:13] <Cork> the site might be in compatibility mode event without shoing it in tha button
[06:52:21] <bl4ckdu5t> If $('element).text() gives what's in the element, and $('element).html() brings what's in the element too, what's the difference between the both methods?
[06:52:24] <thaifood> hmm
[06:52:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: bind click handlers and set a value on the form on click
[06:52:50] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and then handle it from the submit event
[06:53:14] <systemfault> bl4ckdu5t: Try both methods with the following string '<strong>HELLO</strong>'
[06:53:14] <DarsVaeda> I see thanks
[06:53:55] <systemfault> bl4ckdu5t: One returns the text... the other html :P
[06:54:44] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks systemfault
[06:55:11] <bl4ckdu5t> so its HTML is interpreted that's why it appears like text()
[06:56:24] <bl4ckdu5t> I've got a little issue though. I have a case where I checked if($('element').text() === 'Submit'){//do this}else{// do that}
[06:56:33] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: the dom isn't html
[06:56:41] <Cork> so no .html serializes the dom into html
[06:56:42] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:
[06:56:45] <OnceMe> :)
[06:56:53] <thaifood> Cork: i turned off all compatability mode including the stupid default for intranet but i get the same error.
[06:56:53] <Cork> and .text returns just the text in the element (and child elements(

[06:58:20] <thaifood> k
[06:59:02] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:good I solved that slow ajax load and is this comet simulation http://pastebin.com/AX8y4uQM ?
[06:59:31] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: I don't recall this problem, glad you got it sorted out though.
[06:59:55] <OnceMe> eah now I have this issue, is this going to kill my server?
[07:00:03] <OnceMe> is this comet or regular xhr call?
[07:00:17] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure what comet is.
[07:00:34] <Cork> open a new connection as soon as the old one closes
[07:00:40] <OnceMe> a model
[07:00:46] <Cork> and if you don't have any data close the connection
[07:00:53] <OnceMe> Cork so is this comet which I pasted?
[07:00:54] <Cork> so you create a connection storm against the server
[07:01:21] <Cork> OnceMe: looks more like a straight puller
[07:01:23] <thaifood> Cork, I already have this:   http://fpaste.org/127724/08716060/
[07:01:33] <Cork> that makes a request every 10 seconds to check for updates
[07:01:42] <Cork> so no that isn't comet
[07:01:49] <OnceMe> ok how can I modify it to be comet?
[07:01:54] <OnceMe> comet is more efficient as I understood
[07:01:57] <OnceMe> as it connects only once.
[07:01:58] <Cryp71c> Transitioning up in jquery version. Previously we were using .live for an ajax application and now are moving to explicitly .on() however in order to get it to work (as 95% of thea plication is populated via ajax) I'm forced to do $('body').on('focusin', 'input.dob', function() { });
[07:02:00] <BillCriswell> Cork: So keep requesting shit till shit stops returning?
[07:02:19] <Cork> OnceMe: no comet is about the most costly form you have
[07:02:25] <Cryp71c> I'm concerned for performance being worse than before (when using .live) because of the number of event bubblings that must occur being higher?
[07:02:30] <Cork> as it constantly creates new connections
[07:02:38] <Cork> OnceMe: there is no one connection
[07:02:53] <OnceMe> how to modify it then
[07:02:58] <Cork> and the closest you have is ajax stream, and it has sevear memory leak
[07:03:11] <Cork> OnceMe: if you want to use ajax that is about the best you can do
[07:03:16] <BillCriswell> Cryp71c: live was probably doing close to the same thing.
[07:03:26] <Cork> have the server keep the connection open for as long as possible and you have long pull
[07:03:33] <Cork> and that is about the best you can do with ajax
[07:03:39] <Cork> OnceMe: or move to websocket
[07:03:48] <Cork> and you can have true push communication
[07:04:19] <OnceMe> websocket and php implementation does not go together
[07:04:23] <Cork> ya
[07:04:34] <Cork> so long pull is what you have to play with
[07:04:47] <Cork> or just pull
[07:05:00] <Cork> as long pull takes up php processes
[07:05:19] <phelix> http://mindimage.net anyone have an idea how I can get the car to rotate as it gets close to the hill?
[07:05:22] <OnceMe> well I'm polling for 10seconds
[07:05:41] <Cork> your pulling every 10 seconds not for 10 seconds :)
[07:06:01] <Cork> or rather your pulling with 10 seconds interval, not every 10 seconds
[07:06:23] <Cork> OnceMe: and that is the most server efficient way you can implement pulling
[07:06:33] <Cork> and with php, the best you can do
[07:08:22] <RhinoBoss> If I add a sortable option after initialization, do I only need to do it once? For example, I want to disable sorting for items with a specific class. Do I need to call that option everytime the class gets added to an item to refresh it, or does it happen automatically?
[07:08:24] <RhinoBoss> ex: $("#grayList").sortable( "option", "items", "div:not(.ui-state-disabled)");
[07:12:27] <RhinoBoss> If I add a sortable option after initialization, do I only need to do it once? For example, I want to disable sorting for items with a specific class. Do I need to call that option everytime the class gets added to an item to refresh it, or does it happen automatically?
[07:12:28] <RhinoBoss> ex: $("#grayList").sortable( "option", "items", "div:not(.ui-state-disabled)");
[07:17:03] <BillCriswell> RhinoBoss: Looking at the docs it seems like you only need to do it once.
[07:17:25] <stef1a> what's the best way to hide a parent class that has specific children classes? should i just look for the parent class, check if find(child-class-selector) matches the child class selector i want, and then hide the parent if true?
[07:17:53] <BillCriswell> stef1a: You can use .has()
[07:18:08] <BillCriswell> stef1a: So like, $('.parent').has('.child').fadeOut('slow')
[07:18:08] <stef1a> BillCriswell: oh, so then just if (parent.has(child))?
[07:18:30] <RhinoBoss> BillCriswell: thank you
[07:18:38] <BillCriswell> If child is an element that should work as well.
[07:19:58] <BillCriswell> Hmm..
[07:20:33] <stef1a> BillCriswell: sweet. it works! thank you!
[07:20:44] <stef1a> and that's simpler than using an if statement :-)
[07:21:03] <BillCriswell> If depends on what you have to do in the if.
[07:22:58] <stef1a> my case is simple enough that an if statement isn't necessary, although i see what you mean
[07:23:54] <BillCriswell> Now I get why the bin I set up wasn't working. I was putting JS in the CSS panel.
[07:27:35] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Here's the demo I was trying to get to you sooner, but it shows the different ways to use .has(): http://jsbin.com/pizuhopekeqa/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:28:46] <stef1a> BillCriswell: i don't see any js there
[07:29:25] <BillCriswell> Hm.. didn't seem to update.
[07:30:35] <thaifood> Cork, fixed... the browser was in Quirks mode, resetting to IE9 Standards fixed it
[07:31:42] <BillCriswell> Ugh, .foo($) = bye bye jsbin lol
[07:32:25] <phoenixsun> Cork: in the ajax implementation you suggested I assume that it wouldn't progress to the function .done() is there was a problem loading the Json?
[07:34:01] <Hypfer> hi everyone. I am halfway in making a slide out menu on the top of a webpage similar to the menu that pops up with windows rdp or virtualbox in fullscreen
[07:34:08] <Hypfer> however it doesn't quite work
[07:34:14] <Hypfer> I'll put it in a fiddle
[07:34:31] <BillCriswell> stef1a: http://jsbin.com/kuwagozupuku/1/edit there we go.
[07:34:37] <BillCriswell> Not sure what was up.
[07:34:46] <matrixdevuk> Hey guys
[07:34:57] <matrixdevuk> How could I store a function within a json array?
[07:35:11] <stef1a> BillCriswell: great. thanks again!
[07:35:27] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:36:43] * matrixdevuk starts to dance due to ... swag?
[07:38:39] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell do you know how I could achieve my goal?
[07:39:41] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Are you trying to save it to local storage or something?
[07:39:57] <matrixdevuk> Basically, I want to have something where I can put in commands
[07:39:57] <matrixdevuk> like
[07:40:08] <msafi> Hi guys, I have $('.my-videos') selector which returns multiple elements from the page. I want to store some custom data for each of those elements, but if I do $('.my-videos').data('key', val), this data is shared between all those video elements.
[07:40:17] <msafi> How can I store custom data for each element?
[07:40:30] <BillCriswell> msafi: $('.my-videos').eq(0)
[07:40:40] <BillCriswell> 1, 2, 3 etc
[07:40:40] <matrixdevuk> var Storage = ["help":function(){alert("for help, see the support tab");}];
[07:40:45] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell that's kinda what I want
[07:40:53] <fission6> i have a bunch of <ul> tags being rendered to the page, i want to "cut" all the <li>'s after the 4th one in each <ul> to help trim down the bullet points per object i am listing, how would i remove all <li> after the 4th one per each <ul>
[07:40:58] <matrixdevuk> But obviously, no alerts because they suck :P
[07:41:08] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Do you need to transport this data or is it just happening on the page?
[07:41:23] <msafi> BillCriswell: I don't think that would work for me
[07:41:29] <matrixdevuk> It'll have something like $("#output").append("Hi!");
[07:41:33] <msafi> BillCriswell: here's what I'm trying to do https://gist.github.com/msafi/3cf97915b11bc5f4876c
[07:41:34] <matrixdevuk> In each one
[07:41:38] <BillCriswell> Becuase you can do var Storage = { "help": function () { alert("Yo"); }}; just fine.
[07:41:46] <matrixdevuk> Oh, thanks!
[07:41:55] <matrixdevuk> That's such a relief
[07:42:24] <BillCriswell> then Storage.help() would call that function.
[07:42:32] <BillCriswell> Er, method.
[07:43:08] <BillCriswell> msafi: So you want to do it in the data call here?
[07:43:30] <matrixdevuk> Awesome
[07:43:39] <msafi> BillCriswell: my issue is that the selector has multiple elements and I want each of them to have unique data values
[07:43:49] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell how could I add spaces?
[07:43:52] <matrixdevuk> like, so I can have
[07:43:53] <BillCriswell> msafi: Where are these unique values froming from?
[07:44:06] <matrixdevuk> "about name": function(){}
[07:44:13] <msafi> BillCriswell: They are flags that I'd like to set on each video to help me keep track of its status
[07:44:30] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Storage['about name']()
[07:44:37] <BillCriswell> But that's icky.
[07:44:38] <matrixdevuk> Thanks!
[07:44:41] <matrixdevuk> :D
[07:44:43] <BillCriswell> aboutName would be better.
[07:44:47] <matrixdevuk> Damn BillCriswell, you're going ham
[07:44:53] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell I'm designing a terminal web-app thing
[07:44:55] <matrixdevuk> For my website
[07:44:56] <matrixdevuk> lol
[07:45:08] <matrixdevuk> So people can type commands such as "about name" and they get >> Samuel Lewis
[07:45:23] <alphis> anyone good with preg_match php style regexp?
[07:45:30] <alphis> i realize its offtopic ;P
[07:45:52] <alphis> but im trying to match alphanum and {}[]:, chars ....having some trouble
[07:46:13] <BillCriswell> msafi: You can loop through them with .each() and set them that way. TO be honest not sure what you're saying haha.
[07:46:26] <msafi> BillCriswell: Yeah, I'll try that.
[07:46:33] <Hypfer> okay, fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lwkr09j1/ Main problem is that the menu opens instantly, I'm unable to click on anything below it and it opens when the mouse is near the whole upper border and not just the menu area
[07:47:02] <BillCriswell> msafi: I just checked to see if you can pass .data() a function for the second argument like .attr() and .css() but it doesn't seem you cna.
[07:48:45] <msafi> BillCriswell: thanks for your help. I'll try .each! :)
[07:49:36] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/xmukh8p8/ Anyone have an idea how I can get the car to rotate and move up at a specific spot then go back down that little hill?
[07:49:56] <BillCriswell> msafi: http://jsbin.com/quvitekohipi/1/edit?html,js,output I think is what you're going for?
[07:50:51] <fission6> any ideas how to trim all <ul> down to the first N <li>'s
[07:51:13] <msafi> BillCriswell: Yeah, I think so, but now I'm getting very strange behavior in my setup. Let me check.
[07:51:40] <BillCriswell> fission6: $('ul ul').remove()?
[07:51:47] <fission6> ?
[07:52:00] <BillCriswell> That's my guess for what you're tring to do.
[07:52:43] <phoenixsun> in my json call .getJSON(url, function(data){stuff to view data});   I keep getting a 'function undefined error''. What am I missing. I put a fail method there to make sure it wasn't a load error. It never triggered the error.
[07:53:59] <fission6> that not even close
[07:54:09] <fission6> maybe you mis understood my prob or i wasn't clear BillCriswell
[07:54:32] <BillCriswell> fission6: I thought you want the uls only so deep. Now that I reread it only only want the first X lis.
[07:55:06] <BillCriswell> fission6: $('ul li').slice(0, 5).remove() should handle it.
[07:56:03] <fission6> i want to limit all <ul>'s multiple per page to have the first 5 <li>'s
[07:56:22] <fission6> for each UL, remove all LI after the 5th one
[07:56:31] <BillCriswell> fission6: I meant .slice(5)
[07:56:53] <fission6> unfortentaly that doesn't appear to handle the multiple UL tags
[07:57:05] <fission6> just keeps the first 5 lis on the page
[07:57:16] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell How could I check if Commands['abc'] exists?
[07:57:23] <BillCriswell> fission6: http://jsbin.com/dawoguvejomi/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:57:45] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: if ( Commands['abc'] )
[07:57:53] <matrixdevuk> you sure that'd work?
[07:57:59] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:58:02] <matrixdevuk> alrighty
[07:58:38] <fission6> BillCriswell: that jsbin looks great, thank you
[07:58:52] <BillCriswell> Also, Commands.abc is easier to read so I'd use that.
[07:59:52] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: http://jsbin.com/cemepitotuje/1/edit
[08:01:00] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell I have this and it refuses to work: var value = $("#terminalInput").value(); if (cmds[value]) { cmds[value](); }else{ alert("NOT FOUND!!!!"); }
[08:01:10] <matrixdevuk> it shoudl say not found
[08:01:13] <matrixdevuk> should*

[08:05:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/cemepitotuje/3/edit?js,output this might be easier to read... but I'm also not sure how safe "in" is to use..
[08:05:41] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell I was using .value() :P
[08:05:46] <matrixdevuk> thanks for the .val() thing
[08:05:48] <BillCriswell> Ah, missed that.
[08:05:49] <matrixdevuk> works now
[08:06:21] <BillCriswell> Cool
[08:06:26] <BillCriswell> I could go for a nice bagel.
[08:06:51] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell I'll buy you one!
[08:06:51] <matrixdevuk> ;D
[08:07:27] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:27:30] <Uhkis> BillCriswell and his bagels :)
[08:28:58] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell how could I keep the scroll bar to the bottom of my div always
[08:28:59] <BillCriswell> They sound really good right now.
[08:29:06] <matrixdevuk> for example, I prepend an item such as a <p> to my div
[08:29:12] <matrixdevuk> append*
[08:29:22] <matrixdevuk> and then like a live chat, it stays at the bottom of the div
[08:29:49] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: I'd probably just scrollTo(10000000) or something if I'm prototyping.
[08:30:03] <matrixdevuk> how does that work?
[08:30:16] <matrixdevuk> Would I do like $("#myDiv").scrollTo(9999999999999)
[08:30:17] <matrixdevuk> ?
[08:30:40] <BillCriswell> Yes, think that could work?
[08:31:26] <matrixdevuk> well, that didn't work
[08:31:27] <matrixdevuk> lol
[08:31:29] <BillCriswell> I think it might be $('#myDiv').get(0).scrollto(0, 9999999);
[08:31:36] <matrixdevuk> ah, ok
[08:31:36] <BillCriswell> Er, scrollTo *
[08:31:53] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: You can do $('#myDiv').scrollTop(9999999) probably.
[08:31:57] <BillCriswell> Keep it jQuery.
[08:32:31] <matrixdevuk> hmm
[08:32:57] <matrixdevuk> nope :(
[08:33:08] <matrixdevuk> no errors either
[08:34:04] <decx> use scrollHeight prop
[08:34:15] <matrixdevuk> decx how do it r b work
[08:34:26] <decx> it do
[08:34:45] <matrixdevuk> decx teech me
[08:34:56] <matrixdevuk> givem me lesun
[08:35:10] <decx> scrollTop(mycont.prop('scrollHeight'))
[08:35:55] <BillCriswell> decx: Nice.
[08:36:13] <BillCriswell> Forgot about that.
[08:37:54] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell you bein forgetful
[08:37:58] * matrixdevuk tuts
[08:38:02] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:38:04] <BillCriswell> Always.
[08:38:30] <matrixdevuk> nope :/
[08:38:35] <matrixdevuk> Remember that this is a div
[08:38:37] <matrixdevuk> not a textarea
[08:38:48] <matrixdevuk> I need to scroll down the div
[08:39:30] <decx> doesnt matter
[08:39:48] <matrixdevuk> well, it apparently does
[08:40:06] <matrixdevuk> oh wait
[08:40:07] <matrixdevuk> i know why
[08:40:08] <matrixdevuk> lol
[08:41:15] <matrixdevuk> nope
[08:41:17] <matrixdevuk> Nothing :(
[08:41:36] <matrixdevuk> pasting code
[08:42:51] <matrixdevuk> decx BillCriswell http://p.mduk.pw/paste.php?id=25
[08:43:18] <robertmaxrees> 'enterkey'?
[08:43:40] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: http://jsbin.com/zikalusetoqa/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:43:49] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees custom function
[08:43:55] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[08:44:59] <matrixdevuk> $("#terminalOutput").scrollTop($("#terminalOutput").scrollHeight); - BillCriswell - not working
[08:45:00] <matrixdevuk> :(
[08:45:27] <BillCriswell> scrollHeight isn't a jquery property, it's from the DOM.
[08:45:51] <BillCriswell> So you'd need to do $('#terminalOutput')[0].scrollHeight or  $('#terminalOutput').get(0).scrollHeight
[08:45:56] <matrixdevuk> ok
[08:46:21] <matrixdevuk> still nope :/
[08:46:32] <matrixdevuk> $("#terminalOutput").scrollTop($("#terminalOutput")[0].scrollHeight);
[08:46:35] <matrixdevuk> using that
[08:47:21] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Do you have overflow: auto; on that div?
[08:47:27] <matrixdevuk> no
[08:47:31] <matrixdevuk> overflow-y: scroll;
[08:47:53] <BillCriswell> Is there any other error?
[08:48:01] <matrixdevuk> no errors at all, ill double check
[08:48:11] <matrixdevuk> yeah, no errors
[08:48:20] <BillCriswell> ok.. because the demo does work and if you have exactly that then...
[08:51:13] <decx> dont need no [0] for scrollHeight
[08:52:10] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh duh prop.
[08:52:17] <BillCriswell> Like you did 3 minutes ago.
[08:52:45] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: http://jsbin.com/zikalusetoqa/2/edit?js,output
[08:52:46] <decx> but i took a shower for like 15 minutes
[08:52:50] <decx> imposter !?
[08:53:55] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:54:18] <BillCriswell> decx: Think a command line tool to make form elements would be stupid?
[08:54:25] <BillCriswell> I am thinking about doing it...
[08:54:38] <BillCriswell> Well.. not a command line tool, but a tool that has a commandline.
[08:54:48] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell that code u sent
[08:54:50] <decx> like that autosuggest thing you had yesterday?
[08:54:53] <matrixdevuk> it didnt scroll down automatically for me
[08:54:56] <matrixdevuk> ._.
[08:55:06] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[08:55:06] <decx> i dont see the application
[08:55:26] <BillCriswell> just for generating form html real quick
[08:55:30] <decx> it's like a less cool syntax completion in an editor
[08:55:58] <decx> and people who don't want to write html will just be confused anyway :>
[08:55:58] <BillCriswell> Yeah I guess that's what it would basically be doing.
[08:56:52] <BillCriswell> I think I'll just do it for fun at this point.
[08:57:04] <decx> forms and fun? you are a strange man
[08:57:25] <BillCriswell> trying to think of the most intuitive way for like a build string, like maybe: checkbox Hobbies hobbies['foo'] Some Value
[08:57:57] <BillCriswell> I did a bit of it in Vue last night: http://jsfiddle.net/307qtk1L/
[08:59:03] <decx> i'll never get used to this kind of html
[08:59:34] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm trying to embrace it, it is really weird for me too... but it's really damn easy to follow at the same time.
[08:59:51] <decx> i like what jsfiddle do that could be cool expanded
[09:00:17] <decx> write input press tab, input gets created with focus on type, and then with arrow down up you could set the type
[09:00:22] <decx> does*
[09:01:18] <BillCriswell> decx: That's how I'm thinking about it. You hit enter and the input stays and you can modify that command a bit... At least I think that's what you mean.
[09:01:35] <BillCriswell> I'll group them up based on the names provided.
[09:03:19] <Lawhater> How in jquery do i add a class to a tag but remove it from any other tag that has it?
[09:03:38] <Lawhater> I have li tags but i want to apply a class "selected" to only one of them at a time.
[09:03:49] <decx> i use siblings
[09:03:56] <robertmaxrees> $('*').removeClass('theClass'); $('yourThing').addClass('theClass');
[09:04:01] <robertmaxrees> limit that first selection.
[09:04:05] <robertmaxrees> or use siblings.
[09:04:07] <decx> $(this).addClass('blah').siblings().removeClass('blah')
[09:04:09] <robertmaxrees> a few different choices.
[09:04:20] <decx> * ... really?
[09:04:26] <decx> go and get some coffee man :D
[09:04:40] <robertmaxrees> "limit that first selection" ;)
[09:04:59] <decx> yeah like $('.theClass') for example ^^
[09:05:03] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:05:22] <robertmaxrees> $('theClass').removeClass('theClass'); $('yourThing').addClass('theClass');
[09:05:37] <Lawhater> well
[09:05:45] <Lawhater> they are list elements so i cant do thisClass
[09:05:49] <Lawhater> because wouldnt that get all of them?
[09:06:01] <robertmaxrees> sure you can - they have the class you want to get rid of.
[09:07:01] <Lawhater> robertmaxrees here is my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/wwkh8dw6/
[09:07:12] <Lawhater> When I select a Li element, it applis the class but doesnt remove any from the other one
[09:08:21] <decx> there Lawhater http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4zrffmLw/
[09:08:40] <decx> 7 characters for a fiddle id wow
[09:08:56] <Lawhater> decx thanks
[09:09:17] <Lawhater> decx somehow mine works there too :S
[09:09:41] <Lawhater> decx so now after doing this i can get the text of the li element right since only sleected one has the selected class
[09:09:57] <Lawhater> This is mine updated it works :S http://jsfiddle.net/wwkh8dw6/1/
[09:10:36] <decx> there are odd/even pseudo selectors for css you know
[09:11:32] <BillCriswell> :nth-child(even) weee
[09:11:43] <decx> if you click the li you don't need the selected class to get its text waddaya mean
[09:13:00] <Lawhater> So what i want is that. When someone selects a li element that to highlight it (apply the .selected class) but I also want the text of that div
[09:13:30] <decx> what like $(this).text()
[09:14:13] <decx> i have to cook dinner today 18er
[09:17:49] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell can you help meeeee :((((
[09:18:01] <matrixdevuk> I really am confused
[09:19:58] <Lawhater> Its not working :S
[09:20:32] <Lawhater> robertmaxrees can u assist? http://bpaste.net/show/0c40b4a4b1dc
[09:22:54] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell? :(
[09:28:41] <phoenixsun> is it possible to return an object from the .ajax() success method?
[09:29:30] <matrixdevuk> phoenixsun U WOT M8
[09:29:34] <phoenixsun> to return the 'data' from the function (data) 'function'
[09:29:53] <matrixdevuk> it is possible
[09:29:59] <matrixdevuk> it's a function
[09:30:03] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: return { data: data };
[09:30:05] <matrixdevuk> functions return anything
[09:30:14] <thinkxl> you just need to be sure that data exist
[09:30:22] <thinkxl> if (data) { return {data:data} }
[09:31:08] <phoenixsun> and method is itself held in a function, will that act as the return statement for the containing function?
[09:31:34] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: what you are trying to do ?
[09:31:41] <thinkxl> you can return it as a promise too
[09:32:54] <phoenixsun> I created a function and I passing a string that then forms part of the ajax call which is in the function. That I want to pass the data back to the original calling point of the function
[09:33:16] <phoenixsun> if that makes sense
[09:33:36] <phoenixsun> the ajax itself is within an function
[09:33:47] <phoenixsun> a*
[09:34:04] <robertmaxrees> can you show us your code?
[09:34:09] <thinkxl> yes, better
[09:34:17] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: show us your code
[09:34:41] <phoenixsun> thinkxl: ok I will try
[09:40:11] <phoenixsun> thinkxl: Think is not functional cos there are many pieces I would have to recreate. But its shows where I am trying to return the JSON and exit the function http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=JASeTRLdIa
[09:40:59] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun so you want to return from your ajax, and then have that data return from the parent function?
[09:41:04] <robertmaxrees> because that won't do what you think it will.
[09:41:05] <phoenixsun> yes
[09:41:22] <phoenixsun> I figured as much so I didn't even try to run that
[09:41:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to hook into the .done() callback
[09:42:00] <thinkxl> what robertmaxrees said
[09:42:11] <robertmaxrees> var MyNewTitle = IdToTitle(nextId); won't ever be what you want it do, so any logic that relies on the returned data from your ajax should instead be done within the .done() metho on the ajax.
[09:42:12] <phoenixsun> ok I will go and look it up
[09:42:50] <phoenixsun> actually I tried that previously
[09:43:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ar11ttct/
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> this is what you wnat.
[09:43:07] <robertmaxrees> no to return out of the function.
[09:44:00] <phoenixsun> thats I am currently doing things
[09:44:27] <phoenixsun> I have a function I call doSomething(data) out of the success or in your call done() function
[09:44:37] <phoenixsun> but that just means that its not as elegant
[09:44:50] <phoenixsun> if I still cant return the data as such
[09:45:25] <thinkxl> what you mean about elegan?
[09:46:06] <phoenixsun> I can't return the json data to the function that originally called it
[09:46:30] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: adding a callback?
[09:46:50] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun because it's async.
[09:46:57] <robertmaxrees> the request fires off and your code keeps going.
[09:47:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't pause execution
[09:48:32] <phoenixsun> ok the simplification of my question is how would you best use the 'data' from the ajax call? Assign to some global variables? or variable with a larger/wider scope?
[09:48:39] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[09:48:57] <robertmaxrees> any logic that relies on the returned data should be placed within the .done() callback.
[09:49:28] <thinkxl> that is why node.js is so painfull :P
[09:49:29] <thinkxl> and funny
[09:49:38] <robertmaxrees> nah, not to me.
[09:49:48] <phoenixsun> right its forces you to change your thinking
[09:49:52] <phoenixsun> a little anyway
[09:49:58] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[09:50:05] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: it forces to change your mind into the javascript way
[09:50:05] <robertmaxrees> just requires you to think about callbacks.
[09:50:10] <thinkxl> and promises
[09:50:29] <thinkxl> http://callbackhell.com/
[09:50:36] <thinkxl> phoenixsun: ^
[09:50:40] <phoenixsun> lol I will look at that site
[10:17:46] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell
[10:17:48] <matrixdevuk> You there?
[10:17:58] <Hornet> not a stupid question, honest; any reason a jquery .post would trigger fail status, when it didn't actually fail?
[10:18:06] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Yes.
[10:18:15] <Hornet> I'm watching the request go off in firebug, response is given almost instantly
[10:18:19] <matrixdevuk> Hornet nope
[10:18:27] <Hornet> .done does nothing, only .fail works
[10:18:40] <matrixdevuk> it's .success I think
[10:18:43] <matrixdevuk> might be wrong
[10:18:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:18:46] <thinkxl_> Hornet: you trying jsonp ?
[10:18:53] <robertmaxrees> .done() and .fail() are the preferred ones now, matrixdevuk
[10:18:56] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell Can you try and help me do this scroll thing?
[10:19:02] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees I still use .success
[10:19:05] <Hornet> I used the inline one originally, and that didn't work either
[10:19:16] <Hornet> thinkxl: it's sending and recieving json yes
[10:19:36] <thinkxl> Hornet: I got some problems getting the data in fail
[10:19:41] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk you should swap to .done() and .fail() instead.
[10:19:44] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: I said all I could about that. UNless you set up a fiddle I can't really help.
[10:19:49] <thinkxl> Hornet: that was because server won't allow jsonp
[10:19:56] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell do you have team viewer?
[10:20:01] <BillCriswell> No.
[10:20:18] <Hornet> thinkxl, this is localhost, no reason why it shouldn't work
[10:20:29] <robertmaxrees> Hornet and your data is valid
[10:20:31] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:20:40] <Hornet> er yes
[10:20:47] <Hornet> firebug reports it in the json tab
[10:20:53] <Hornet> it's not text soup
[10:21:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean jquery was able to parse your data successfully ;)
[10:21:17] <Hornet> {'status':'success'} if it can't parse that then someone needs a lobotomy
[10:21:31] <robertmaxrees> try .fail(function jqXhr, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log(errorThrown) });
[10:21:33] <robertmaxrees> give this a shot.
[10:21:42] <Hornet> one moment good sir or madman
[10:22:17] <Hornet> I assume you missed a bracket?
[10:22:34] <robertmaxrees> .fail(function () {jqXhr, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log(errorThrown) });
[10:22:39] <robertmaxrees> wait, crap.
[10:22:40] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:22:51] <Hornet> I know what you mean, already sorting it
[10:23:01] <robertmaxrees> .fail(function (jqXhr, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log(errorThrown) }); there we go.  missing a paren
[10:23:10] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell is it possible the idea that you have is wrong? I'm trying to make it kinda like facebook chat
[10:23:12] <matrixdevuk> or this, even
[10:23:25] <matrixdevuk> where as soon as an item is added to the div, it scrolls to the bottom
[10:23:31] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: I showed you it working though lol
[10:23:37] <matrixdevuk> You didn't
[10:23:41] <BillCriswell> Yes I did.
[10:23:43] <matrixdevuk> the code you sent me didn't work :(
[10:23:49] <matrixdevuk> As in, the fiddle you sent me
[10:23:53] <matrixdevuk> it didnt scroll to the bottom
[10:24:15] <Hornet> parser error...
[10:24:21] <robertmaxrees> Hornet ;)
[10:24:28] <Hornet> expected property name or } at like 1 column 2 of json data
[10:24:29] <robertmaxrees> Hornet then the issue is your data.
[10:24:50] <Hornet> {'status':'success'} is the data
[10:24:52] <Hornet> that's valid
[10:25:03] <robertmaxrees> are your headers correct?
[10:25:06] <Hornet> yes
[10:25:14] <Hornet> applicationjson
[10:25:14] <robertmaxrees> request and response?
[10:25:21] <Hornet> request no idea
[10:25:53] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: http://jsbin.com/puluhiponefi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:26:16] <Hornet> hah
[10:26:23] <Hornet> just tried it with no headers, and it worked
[10:26:27] <Hornet> what the flying frak
[10:26:38] <robertmaxrees> Hornet sounds like a mismatch of some kind.
[10:26:49] <Hornet> content-type: application/json is apparently too good for jquery
[10:26:52] <Hornet> how mad
[10:26:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:27:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like bad response headers.
[10:27:17] <Hornet> those are pretty standard json headers
[10:27:21] <robertmaxrees> or request headers.
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> if you think you found a bug, by all meands head over to #jquery-dev and tell them :)
[10:28:07] <Hornet> they never listen without a fiddle
[10:28:39] <robertmaxrees> you're asking them to just take your word otherwise.
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> i still say your headers were wrong.
[10:28:48] <Hornet> and obviously, headers aren't doable on a fiddle, and I sure as heck don't have time to isolate and deploy the issue on my server
[10:29:02] <robertmaxrees> request or response
[10:29:10] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: http://jsbin.com/puluhiponefi/2/edit?js,output
[10:29:46] <Hornet> it's the response header 'Content-type: application/json'
[10:29:49] <matrixdevuk> hmm
[10:29:53] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell it doesnt work with mine
[10:29:55] <robertmaxrees> and request header, Hornet?
[10:29:57] <matrixdevuk> ill re-paste my code
[10:29:57] <matrixdevuk> :/
[10:30:07] <Hornet> it's fine when I comment that header out
[10:30:10] <Hornet> request I have no idea
[10:30:23] <robertmaxrees> try fixing your request header and see if that resolves it.
[10:30:28] <Hornet> gzip, deflate
[10:30:31] <Hornet> 'fix' how?
[10:30:35] <Hornet> it's an ajax request
[10:30:39] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:30:43] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: With your code.
[10:30:44] <BillCriswell> ?
[10:30:44] <robertmaxrees> you can change your request headers.
[10:30:54] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell yes
[10:31:12] <Hornet> why would I need to...?  I know what the server does, I wrote the backend too
[10:31:20] <Hornet> as just said the issue is the response header
[10:31:39] <BillCriswell> Okie doke.
[10:31:44] <robertmaxrees> read the docs about the contentType and dataType options in ajax, Hornet
[10:31:57] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ <- make sure these are correct within your ajax request.
[10:32:25] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell http://p.mduk.pw/paste.php?id=26
[10:32:54] <Hornet> what would you suggest I set them too?
[10:33:19] <Hornet> it's adding x-requested-with as it should do
[10:33:39] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: and terminalOutput has a height and an overflow scroll on it, right?
[10:34:21] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell height: 350px;	width: 80%; margin: 10px auto;	background: #222; color: #fff; border-radius: 2px; overflow-y: scroll;
[10:35:48] <BillCriswell> Can you scroll the div manually?
[10:35:52] <matrixdevuk> Yes
[10:36:57] <Hornet> moving on anyway... non-issue now what I've worked out the cause
[10:37:02] <Hornet> will debug jquery when time allows
[10:37:06] <Hornet> eta next decade
[10:37:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:37:08] <BillCriswell> The items get appends but it doesn't scroll?
[10:37:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery issue, but ok.
[10:37:25] <matrixdevuk> yes, BillCriswell
[10:37:31] <matrixdevuk> it all works 100% perfectly
[10:37:35] <Hornet> if jquery won't parse json when told that it is, something is up
[10:37:36] <matrixdevuk> except the scrolling issue
[10:38:06] <Hornet> the request sent is 100% irrelevant to what is returned
[10:38:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:38:17] <robertmaxrees> but believe what you want :)
[10:38:24] <Hornet> I could send it stating that it's encoded as swiss cheese and the server would return the same
[10:39:02] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: There must be more to it.
[10:39:09] <matrixdevuk> nope
[10:39:09] <matrixdevuk> :/
[10:39:16] <matrixdevuk> hmm
[10:39:27] <matrixdevuk> maybe if i add a delay to it?
[10:39:32] <matrixdevuk> using setTimeout or something
[10:40:07] <robertmaxrees> is this content getting added via ajax?  and if so, are you running your logic in the done callback for it, matrixdevuk?
[10:40:13] <matrixdevuk> No.
[10:40:21] <robertmaxrees> to which question?
[10:40:24] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: If I don't need one then you shouldn't.
[10:40:37] <matrixdevuk> They enter a command into an input
[10:40:49] <matrixdevuk> and it executes a function depending on the command entered
[10:40:59] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/puluhiponefi/2/edit?js,output basically this, but his with the exact same setup apparently isn't working
[10:41:01] <matrixdevuk> and that returns a value to append
[10:41:04] <matrixdevuk> then is scrolls
[10:41:07] <matrixdevuk> it*
[10:41:11] <matrixdevuk> or well, it supposed to
[10:41:29] <robertmaxrees> no console errors or anything?
[10:41:48] <BillCriswell> "nope"
[10:42:09] <BillCriswell> brb, beta 2 time bitchessss
[10:42:49] * matrixdevuk is confused
[10:42:54] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees do you have team viewer
[10:42:59] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk then it's super hard to help you - if you can't show us what you've got and we're able to give you a functioning example, how do you expect us to assist?
[10:43:06] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk nope.
[10:43:30] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees Bill's last example worked, but not when i put it on my file
[10:43:31] <matrixdevuk> lol
[10:44:00] <robertmaxrees> then it's probably an issue with selectors, css, your version of jquery, invalid markup...
[10:44:09] <robertmaxrees> this is why it's hard to help you without seeing an isolated example.
[10:44:20] <matrixdevuk> jquery-latest.min.js
[10:44:25] <matrixdevuk> css is basic
[10:44:30] <robertmaxrees> what url are you using for jquery?
[10:44:43] <matrixdevuk> I downloaded http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[10:45:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:45:24] <robertmaxrees> so 1.11.1
[10:45:33] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, dunno mano.
[10:45:39] <robertmaxrees> without an example we can't really help.
[10:46:24] <matrixdevuk> I've given you my source
[10:46:29] <matrixdevuk> http://p.mduk.pw/paste.php?id=26
[10:46:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not a complete example.
[10:46:49] <matrixdevuk> ill screenshot the dom
[10:46:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[10:46:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to be helpful.
[10:47:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to type it out ;)
[10:47:26] <robertmaxrees> btw prop('scrollHeight') smells to me.
[10:48:03] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees https://www.dropbox.com/s/obftne8krw2ydiy/Screenshot%202014-08-22%2018.47.52.png?dl=0
[10:48:19] <matrixdevuk> Well, you'd only need to type <div id="terminalOutput">
[10:48:20] <matrixdevuk> :/
[10:48:35] <robertmaxrees> also, divs don't have val()
[10:48:39] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for inputs.
[10:48:45] <matrixdevuk> i know
[10:48:53] <matrixdevuk> and terminalInput is an input
[10:49:13] <robertmaxrees> i can't see it in your screenshot - please share the code for that page via a fiddle.
[10:50:26] <robertmaxrees> this should be simple enough that you can create a test case on jsfiddle.
[10:55:02] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/matrixdevuk/ov38LpLf/
[10:55:29] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were using jquery 1.11.1?
[10:55:42] <matrixdevuk> ?
[10:55:54] <robertmaxrees> the jquery version in the dropdown was set to 1.6.x
[10:55:58] <robertmaxrees> still works fine with 1.11.1
[10:56:22] <matrixdevuk> i am using whatever jquery-latest.min.js is
[10:56:28] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle wasn't.
[10:56:39] <matrixdevuk> i mean, on my file
[10:56:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, the fiddle works fine.
[10:56:41] <robertmaxrees> soooo.
[10:56:47] <matrixdevuk> I literally downloaded jquery-latest.min.js
[10:57:01] <matrixdevuk> but, it still doesnt work with 1.6.4
[10:57:09] <robertmaxrees> it works with both for me in the fiddle.
[10:58:31] <matrixdevuk> you sure?
[10:58:36] <matrixdevuk> it doesn't scroll down for me
[10:59:00] <robertmaxrees> sec
[10:59:30] <matrixdevuk> it's meant to go to the bottom <p> of the div
[10:59:42] <matrixdevuk> to give it a live chat-like effect
[10:59:46] <matrixdevuk> or, terminal effect
[11:00:03] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[11:00:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:02:23] <robertmaxrees> your css yo.
[11:02:42] <robertmaxrees> you need the styles he showed you on #terminmal, not .top
[11:02:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ov38LpLf/3/
[11:05:28] <Woet> so, any idea why .hasClass is failing on me? http://jsfiddle.net/un3ppve3/
[11:08:30] <robertmaxrees> path ?
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> path is not an element
[11:09:16] <robertmaxrees> aaaah svg.
[11:09:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery can't read SVG iirc
[11:19:27] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees what did you change?
[11:19:53] <robertmaxrees> I told you :) changed the .top selector to #terminal.
[11:21:41] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees what line?
[11:21:48] <robertmaxrees> in your css >.>
[11:22:18] <robertmaxrees> line 38 - i changed .top to #terminalOutput
[11:24:25] <guideX> how come bundling jquery doesn't work usually
[11:24:33] <robertmaxrees> works for me.
[11:24:36] <guideX> oh hmm'
[11:24:59] <robertmaxrees> wht breaks for you?
[11:25:31] <guideX> there's a lot of jQuery is not defined type errors
[11:25:36] <guideX> $ is not defined
[11:25:37] <guideX> etc
[11:25:45] <robertmaxrees> how are you bundling it?
[11:25:55] <guideX> with Squishit
[11:26:04] <guideX> a .net bundling framework
[11:26:27] <robertmaxrees> your files are included after jquery, right?
[11:26:32] <guideX> jquery is first
[11:27:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the file, but it sounds like you're doing something wierd.
[11:27:08] <robertmaxrees> *weird
[11:27:46] <guideX> don't think jquery gets bundled when I try
[11:27:51] <guideX> maybe that's the problem..
[11:27:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:28:02] <guideX> all the other files do, weird..
[11:34:03] <guideX> ah there we go
[11:34:12] <guideX> bad cache I guess
[11:34:17] <guideX> thanks!
[11:35:28] <juslintek> Guys do you know what that slider like grid view stuff on dole frontpage is called? http://www.dole.com
[11:35:51] <robertmaxrees> no specific name for it afaik
[11:35:55] <juslintek> those grid view extndables
[11:36:26] <robertmaxrees> what part of the page?
[11:36:33] <juslintek> top
[11:36:36] <juslintek> below menu
[11:36:46] <robertmaxrees> where it slightly zooms in on mouseenter?
[11:36:53] <juslintek> yes
[11:37:04] <robertmaxrees> and that click interaction?  dunno if there's a specific name for it.
[11:37:25] <juslintek> Wonder if there are any premades for that one :-)
[11:37:31] <robertmaxrees> there may be.
[11:37:42] <juslintek> But dont know how to look for it :-D
[11:39:38] <juslintek> Thumbnail based browsing place, where I could find that sort of frameworks?
[11:39:50] <BillCriswell> juslintek: Should be able to replicate it pretty easy animating background size.
[11:39:56] <robertmaxrees> that wouldn't be a framework anyway
[11:40:10] <juslintek> well premade
[11:40:13] <juslintek> whatever it is
[11:40:22] <juslintek> I want to remake it on wordpress
[11:40:24] <robertmaxrees> there probably isn't anything premade - BillCriswell's suggestion is pretty good.
[11:41:39] <decx> it's a technique called zoom
[11:41:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:42:05] <decx> add panning and you can be overly pretentious and say "ken burns effect"
[11:42:35] <BillCriswell> Hm, background-size doesn't seem animatable?
[11:42:57] <BillCriswell> .... I'm doing something wrong.
[11:43:55] <BillCriswell> What the hell am I doing wrong.
[11:45:04] <BillCriswell> Am I doing anything glaringly wrong? http://jsbin.com/loxazutifixe/1/edit?html,css,output
[11:46:06] <BillCriswell> Might ned to use an image.
[11:46:53] <decx> no i did that
[11:47:40] <BillCriswell> YES YOU DID
[11:47:43] <BillCriswell> What, I don't know.
[11:48:21] <OverflowDude> Guys, how do I perform a certain action when user gets to a certain element (by scrolling)?
[11:48:42] <decx> maybe setting background after background-size overrides something?
[11:49:08] <OverflowDude> I want to fade in section of the text for example when a user gets to the bottom of the page.
[11:49:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Not sure.
[11:49:56] <decx> yep
[11:50:08] <decx> background: after background-size: kills the transition
[11:50:15] <BillCriswell> Thanks a lot Obama.
[11:50:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Very interesting. Good catch.
[11:50:46] <BillCriswell> Wonder if that's a bug.
[11:51:02] <BillCriswell> Can you set background-size in background shorthand?
[11:51:17] <decx> url("http://placekitten.com/600/600") repeat scroll center center / 100% auto transparent
[11:51:32] <decx> says firebug
[11:51:45] <decx> not like i can remember that
[11:52:39] <BillCriswell> I always fuck up shorthand everything.
[11:52:56] <BillCriswell> juslintek: http://jsbin.com/loxazutifixe/2/edit I did it with a div and an img tag here.
[11:53:28] <BillCriswell> transform scale thingie would probably be easier.
[11:54:38] <BillCriswell> scale is much easier. I am a dumbas.
[11:55:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/loxazutifixe/3/edit?css,output there we go.
[11:55:55] <BillCriswell> The first way would allow older browers to pretend like they know what they're doing though.
[11:58:06] <juslintek> Found what that is. Its TweenMax and TimelineMax
[11:58:35] <matrixdevuk> Thanks robertmaxrees
[11:58:41] <BillCriswell> juslintek: or just the CSS I gave you haha
[11:59:02] <decx> tweenmax is just a way for flash devs to get used to not flash
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk figure it out?
[11:59:28] <matrixdevuk> Yeah
[11:59:34] <matrixdevuk> had to mess with your css change tho
[11:59:39] <matrixdevuk> to make it look like original
[11:59:42] <matrixdevuk> but it's perfect now
[11:59:42] <matrixdevuk> :D
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - do you understand what your problem was?
[11:59:47] <matrixdevuk> yes
[11:59:50] <matrixdevuk> :)
[12:01:11] <robertmaxrees> that's why we asked for a fiddle ;)
[12:01:16] <BillCriswell> juslintek: http://jsbin.com/loxazutifixe/4/edit?css,output weee
[12:01:25] <juslintek> BillCriswell, well that mouse over stuff is easy, the other part, where div grows in :-)
[12:01:36] <juslintek> Is tougher
[12:01:52] <BillCriswell> Oh I didn't click.
[12:02:11] <robertmaxrees> change positioning and z-index, then animate width and height.
[12:02:13] <robertmaxrees> (bam)
[12:02:28] <decx> gotta add rotate(720deg) to the hover transform
[12:02:32] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:03:39] <OverflowDude> Nevermind, I figured it out.
[12:03:42] <juslintek> Well okay okay, its not that hard, but still, in the end I need to make js and css runing on wordpress for dynamic use so interface stuff invovled for stupid users.
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> bwuh?
[12:06:16] <juslintek> By interfance I mean assigning pages or posts to those div which animate in and as well image insert interface.
[12:07:28] <BillCriswell> CSS is all grown up. =')
[12:09:10] <BillCriswell> I just took a total guess at something and it completely worked.
[12:09:19] <BillCriswell> Going to be a good weekend/week vacation.
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> oh shit!  you out next week?
[12:09:35] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:09:52] <BillCriswell> Bill will be south of the border.
[12:09:53] <robertmaxrees> very nice.  staycation or what?
[12:09:56] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[12:10:30] <BillCriswell> Yeah, riveira maya in mexico... should be awesome.
[12:10:40] <robertmaxrees> very nice.
[12:13:48] <BillCriswell> I wish I knew excel.
[12:14:10] <BillCriswell> I hate this program. I feel liek if I could use it properly I'd hate it a lot less.
[12:14:32] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/xrX4VV0.gif <- was it somebody in here that called this endusers.gif?
[12:14:53] <BillCriswell> whoever did was hilarious.
[12:15:25] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvmT5VXIMAAf_bF.jpg:large
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> yyeeeeessssssssssssssss
[12:15:43] <robertmaxrees> we've come a long way.
[12:16:03] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, i dont get it, why did you link a perfectly normal screenshot of IE working as intended?
[12:16:11] <robertmaxrees> Jattenalle *IE6
[12:16:12] <BillCriswell> Hahah
[12:16:39] <Woet> I had to log off, but any idea why .hasClass is failing on me? http://jsfiddle.net/un3ppve3/
[12:16:50] <robertmaxrees> Woet you can't read SVG with jQuery iirc
[12:17:05] <Woet> hm, that's a shame
[12:17:28] <robertmaxrees> it's not like nomal DOM so jquery gets confused.
[12:17:28] <Woet> guess i'll have to manually check if the string is in .attr('class')
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> are you even able to select elements?
[12:17:57] <robertmaxrees> also inspecting the dom showed me that node didn't have that element anyway.
[12:17:57] <Woet> not sure, the code on jsfiddle is all i tried
[12:18:14] <Woet> why would .attr('class') work if it doesn't have that element?
[12:18:31] <robertmaxrees> just going off what i saw in the inspector.
[12:18:36] <Woet> well, it's there for me
[12:18:38] <robertmaxrees> also try .prop('class');
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> what does that tell you?
[12:18:52] <Woet> [object SVGAnimatedString]
[12:19:05] <robertmaxrees> vs .attr('class')?
[12:19:18] <Woet> .attr says "arc pie layer category1 aaa"
[12:19:27] <Woet> you should get the alert in my jsfiddle code
[12:19:57] <robertmaxrees> welcome to the wacky world of attr vs prop
[12:20:04] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not a fan of alerts for debugging.
[12:20:07] <Woet> me neither
[12:20:10] <Woet> but on jsfiddle I prefer it
[12:20:15] <robertmaxrees> why not console.log()?
[12:20:25] <Woet> i use it, i changed it to alert for the purpose of linking it here
[12:20:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:21:11] <Jattenalle> geez, i think my friend just came across the worst site ever designed... http://www.aerolithgaming.com/
[12:21:17] <Woet> instead of making people here open the link and not seeing anything, I changed it to alert so it's obvious
[12:21:30] <robertmaxrees> they'll know to look at the console, Woet ;)
[12:21:45] <Woet> alright
[12:21:49] <Woet> same problem tho
[12:22:06] <Woet> i'll just use .indexOf on attr('class')
[12:22:21] <robertmaxrees> the issue here is hasClass is looking at the class property iirc.
[12:22:23] <robertmaxrees> not the class attribute.
[12:22:31] <Woet> ah
[12:22:31] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Damn.
[12:22:33] <robertmaxrees> which is generally what you want in html.
[12:22:45] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, i herd u liek carousel, so we made all of it carousel, even the background!
[12:22:46] <BillCriswell> Why do people need to mess with the scrolling.
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> Jattenalle i'd love to know what that site has but i can't read anything
[12:23:08] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, aaw, is it the white text on flashing white background?
[12:23:17] <Jattenalle> i found that a genious, clean, next-gen design decission
[12:23:19] <robertmaxrees> or the grey text on the grey background
[12:24:28] <Woet> robertmaxrees: just using ($(this).parent().attr('class').indexOf('category1') != -1) now.
[12:24:50] <robertmaxrees> Woet you want > -1
[12:25:00] <robertmaxrees> err, hah
[12:25:03] <Woet> what's the difference in this case?
[12:25:04] <robertmaxrees> same diff really.
[12:25:06] <Woet> indeed.
[12:25:09] <robertmaxrees> just so used to >
[12:25:16] <robertmaxrees> shorter, accomplishes the same thing.
[12:26:01] <Woet> i'll just say != is faster, 50% chance i'm right
[12:26:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:43] <axilla> hi all, we have been using simplemodal in our application for sometime now and its worked great for us, until today when we decided we needed a nested modal..  we're looking for alternatives to simplemodal, but it MUST support persistance of form values and things like that.  Does anyone know if jqmodal does support persistance or of another modal that is very lightweight and has the feature set i'm looking for?
[12:29:26] <robertmaxrees> "nested modal" sounds really awkward.
[12:31:56] <FoolsRun> Hi, I need to step through a set of <li>s and compare a class on each to the previous item's class, and if they don't match, insert </ul><ul>. Does anyone have a quick example for this?
[12:32:41] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun bwuh?
[12:32:52] <robertmaxrees> why not just explicitly wrap each one with a ul instead?
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> *each class with a UL, i mean.
[12:33:07] <robertmaxrees> Woet http://jsperf.com/not-equal-neg-1-vs-greater-than-neg-1
[12:33:25] <Woet> damn!
[12:33:37] <Woet> did we have an ops command?
[12:33:38] <Woet> !ops
[12:33:39] <Woet> .ops
[12:33:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[12:33:50] <Woet> raaamina is spamming PM
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm an op.
[12:34:08] <FoolsRun> robertmaxrees: I have a set of <li>s that are in order by category, and have a class on them reflecting that category, but they're all in a single <ul>. I want to break them into separate <ul>s
[12:34:39] <Woet> ty
[12:34:45] <robertmaxrees> hah, vladikoff has it.
[12:34:45] <Woet> also, Textual master race
[12:35:06] <decx> somebody hasn't mode +R'ed up
[12:35:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:35:23] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun any reason you can't do that in your backend?
[12:35:54] <robertmaxrees> decx not sure why we haven't done that actually.
[12:36:20] <FoolsRun> robertmaxrees: a few reasons, actually. One of which is that I don't want to tear apart this plugin's templating system.
[12:36:27] <matrixdevuk> GUYZ
[12:36:35] <matrixdevuk> IT'S RAINING QUERIEZ
[12:37:08] <decx> robertmaxrees well it would be overkill for a support channel but you can mode yourself to prevent unauth from querying
[12:37:21] <decx> /mode decx +R
[12:39:20] <robertmaxrees> FoolsRun i'd just remove the ul, get your list of classes and for each one create a new ul, append the appropriate LIs to each, remove the old, shove in the new.
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> you could try to .each(), but relying on order always feels weird to me.
[12:40:13] <decx> didnt know you were an anarchist
[12:40:24] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:40:27] <FoolsRun> Ahh, I see. just move the lis into whole new lists
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:41:48] <FoolsRun> That's even easier, since all I have to do is grab all the lis with the class
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:41:56] <FoolsRun> Cool
[12:41:57] <FoolsRun> Thank you!
[12:42:09] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees and BillCriswell - look what I integrated! https://www.dropbox.com/s/rfib79s70a7x4d4/Screenshot%202014-08-22%2020.41.57.png?dl=0
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk what is this for btw?
[12:42:54] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees a more interactive version of my website
[12:42:54] <matrixdevuk> lol
[12:43:04] <robertmaxrees> who is the intended audience?
[12:43:05] <matrixdevuk> My current site is static, with one bit of animation
[12:43:14] <matrixdevuk> anyone who wants a more fun experience
[12:43:18] <matrixdevuk> it will be optional
[12:43:31] <matrixdevuk> default will be the current one, and this will just be a little bit of fun on the side :P
[12:43:33] <robertmaxrees> >.> okay then
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> i know my day is interesting when I wind up on pages like http://www.quirksmode.org/js/strings.html
[12:45:05] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees can I pm you?
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> sure i suppose
[12:45:41] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: lol
[12:46:24] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Why are you reading this?
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering how .indexOf() and .length work under the hood for strings.
[12:47:15] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell
[12:47:20] <matrixdevuk> You're on yosemite beta 2, right?
[12:47:22] <BillCriswell> Oh, that's a level deeper than I care to go.
[12:47:26] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: Yes.
[12:47:40] <hellhound> hey guys, I got a weird problem related to jqXHR objects. I'm binding the ajaxSuccess event to the document and doing a form submission targeting another frame (to upload files asynchronously). The thing is that for some weird reason jqXHR.getAllResponseHeader() shows an empty string
[12:47:58] <hellhound> and I'm not doing cross-origin requests
[12:48:13] <hellhound> all is being done on the same host
[12:48:28] <matrixdevuk> BillCriswell how long did beta 2 take to download and install?
[12:48:43] <matrixdevuk> I am debating wether or not to upgrade from beta 1
[12:49:03] <hellhound> and I know for sure that the header I want is on the response because I can see it on my browser
[12:49:41] <BillCriswell> matrixdevuk: I guess it was like 15 minutesish?
[12:49:53] <BillCriswell> I didn't wait for the download.. I think it snuck that in the background.
[12:51:06] <matrixdevuk> Really?
[12:51:12] <matrixdevuk> No wonder my internet has been lagging for ages
[12:51:12] <matrixdevuk> lol
[12:51:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, think it usually does that.
[12:51:57] <robertmaxrees> brb lunch
[12:52:01] <hellhound> anyone willing to help me out?
[13:00:59] <matrixdevuk> Hey guys, just for helping me out, I've added this to my web app thingy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lh0faze1b8j4d6p/Screenshot%202014-08-22%2021.00.43.png?dl=0
[13:02:02] <cjwelborn> Finally #jquery getting the recognition it deserves.
[13:02:07] <matrixdevuk> ;D
[13:02:16] <matrixdevuk> ONLY 780 users here
[13:02:19] <matrixdevuk> it needs more
[13:03:45] <robertmaxrees> there's usually over 800
[13:04:08] <matrixdevuk> OVER EIGHT HUNDRED!!!!
[13:04:11] <robertmaxrees> been a little slow lately.
[13:07:14] <Rel> Any idea why the first call to .width() would take 1000ms while subsequent calls take 1 ms?
[13:07:26] <a_b_c_> .
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12414150/jquery-width-method-performance
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> Rel ^
[13:14:21] <Rel> No dice, .css("width") has the same issue
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[13:19:32] <cjwelborn> matrixdevuk: spelling error under RELIABILITY on your site. It's 'Whether' not 'wether'..i know you knew that. I'm just pointing out the location.
[13:19:58] <matrixdevuk> rlly
[13:20:07] <matrixdevuk> i did dat
[13:20:21] <robertmaxrees> "Wether we talk human or server reliability, you can count on me for both."
[13:21:26] <matrixdevuk> I'm confused hre
[13:21:35] <matrixdevuk> "It's 'Wether' not 'wether'"
[13:21:39] <matrixdevuk> Seems the same thing to me
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> it should be Whether
[13:22:03] <matrixdevuk> OHHHH
[13:22:04] <matrixdevuk> I see
[13:22:05] <robertmaxrees> they's saying "you have wether instead of whether
[13:22:05] <matrixdevuk> lol
[13:22:27] <matrixdevuk> Fixed!
[13:22:29] <matrixdevuk> Thanks lol
[13:22:37] <robertmaxrees> what's with the rogue script tag at the end of the page?
[13:22:50] <cjwelborn> matrixdevuk: quick turnaround time :)
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> also you should use a type attribute on all those.
[13:24:08] <robertmaxrees> also you're missing an html tag...
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> because <!--[if (gt IE 10)|!(IE)]> <html lang="en"> <![endif]--> doesn't do what you think it does.
[13:25:37] <robertmaxrees> read http://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/add-body-class-just-for-ie/
[13:28:05] <cjwelborn> I've always wanted to read about what the browsers actually do when there is no 'type' attribute for script and style tags.
[13:28:10] <matrixdevuk> oh
[13:28:16] <matrixdevuk> ok
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> cjwelborn they assume what you mean.
[13:28:31] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk also you should probably run your stuff through a validator.
[13:28:34] <matrixdevuk> Good thing that
[13:28:39] * matrixdevuk is not a frontend developer ;D
[13:28:46] <cjwelborn> robertmaxrees: which is 'text/javascript' for script and 'text/css' for style tags right?
[13:28:51] <robertmaxrees> wep
[13:28:54] <robertmaxrees> *yeo
[13:29:00] <cjwelborn> heh
[13:29:02] <matrixdevuk> It's a bootstrap theme from wrapbootstrap.com
[13:29:11] <matrixdevuk> So don't blame me for the problem
[13:29:12] <matrixdevuk> lol
[13:29:14] <cjwelborn> Well I like to be explicit. Python has taught me that.
[13:29:30] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk eeehhh...
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> 'it's a theme - totally not my fault!' is kind of flaky imo.
[13:29:48] <matrixdevuk> It's not my fault
[13:29:53] <matrixdevuk> I know basically nothing about front end
[13:29:55] <matrixdevuk> I know basics
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> why not learn? :)
[13:30:03] <matrixdevuk> Nah
[13:30:13] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:30:14] <matrixdevuk> Backend is where my brain goes amazeballs
[13:30:26] <matrixdevuk> Although, js is something i am getting into
[13:30:33] <matrixdevuk> Especially now with this terminal :D
[13:30:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:30:54] <robertmaxrees> oh the thin on your site?
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[13:32:14] <ionico> hi
[13:32:32] <ionico> do you know the plug in jquery datatables?
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> we've heard of it.
[13:33:58] <glook> does the usage of jQuery() automatically become $j() ?
[13:34:07] <cjwelborn> matrixdevuk: what is this link: https://github.backendweb.email/ under 'BUSINESS -> BackendWeb'? (i swear I'm not trying to rip your site to pieces, just trying to help)
[13:34:21] <robertmaxrees> glook nope.
[13:34:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a noconflict thing.
[13:34:29] <matrixdevuk> its good at you're doing it
[13:34:38] <matrixdevuk> i need to change the https to http
[13:35:14] <cjwelborn> ahh..i see it works with http now.
[13:35:17] <matrixdevuk> fixed
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you redirecting from your domain to github like that?
[13:36:14] <matrixdevuk> not mine
[13:36:17] <matrixdevuk> its bew's
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> kay
[13:37:01] <glook> Thanks.  I've got some mixed jQuery and Prototype code.  Blech.
[13:37:11] <robertmaxrees> glook D:
[13:37:15] <robertmaxrees> kill the prototype.
[13:37:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:40:19] <Bray90820_> Can you add video to lightbox?
[13:41:04] <ionico> this is my problem,  i was using the jquery datatable plugin very happy, i was using it in this simpliest configuration,  i was populating the data in the same file it was the table trought php,  the problem started when the data grow so much that the table was too slow,  so the way to fix this is using the server side processing method that has datatables ,  but my big problem is that it works
[13:41:04] <ionico> lika a charm when all the data comer directly from the database,  and not all of my data comes from the database, for example one field is the result of adding records from other tables
[13:41:15] <ionico> what would you do in my case?
[13:41:22] <ionico> hope you can understand me
[13:43:01] <robertmaxrees> ionico you'll have more luck at the forums on their site and asking there.
[13:43:08] <robertmaxrees> Bray90820_ which one?
[13:44:42] <EGreg> hey y'all
[13:44:44] <EGreg> jQuery trigger doesnt'w rok
[13:44:48] <EGreg> why? I don't know
[13:44:51] <Bray90820_> robertmaxrees: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[13:46:12] <EGreg> $(jQuery._data(element, "events")).mouseup.length -> 2
[13:46:16] <EGreg> $(element).trigger('mouseup') <-- does nothing!
[13:46:18] <EGreg> doesn't hit any breakpoints
[13:46:21] <EGreg> WHY??
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> EGreg preventdefault on anything?
[13:46:42] <EGreg> yes, but shouldn't it trigger the handlers?
[13:46:48] <jenia> hello. I have a jquery-mobile collapsible. I want to place some buttons inside its header. pressing them should not expand or collapse the collapsible. Is that possible?
[13:47:24] <jenia> i thnk I found. thanks ;)
[13:47:56] <robertmaxrees> EGreg not if you're stopping propagation or something funky.  fiddle?
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> Bray90820_ should be able to.
[13:49:24] <Bray90820_> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[13:50:12] <jenia> robertmaxrees, I stop the propagation for clicking buttons inside a collapsible's header. like so: http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/z3hsb/
[13:50:16] <jenia> is that alright?
[13:51:15] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, sure, but you don't need both methods in there.
[13:51:21] <EGreg> OK fixed it :)
[13:51:25] <EGreg> it was my own code of course hehe
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> also, use console.log() for debugging instead of alert jenia
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> EGreg what was it?
[13:51:55] <jenia> thanks a lot
[13:51:56] <EGreg> My library was wrapping the callback in its own callback
[13:52:00] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:52:01] <EGreg> in its own wrapper
[13:52:11] <EGreg> and that wrapper was looking for the mouse to be near the thing that was being clicked
[13:52:22] <EGreg> (among other things that wrapper cancels a click if mouse or finger moves too much)
[13:52:28] <EGreg> makes sense now.
[13:52:51] <EGreg> OK this teaches me a lesson ... do NOT use the view to manipulate the controller code
[13:52:57] <EGreg> I was going to simulate a click (use the view as a controller)
[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> EGreg D:
[13:57:48] <stef1a> can someone point me to a resource that explains how to reorder items in a list with dropdown menus so that when the index of one is updated, the index of the one it's replacing in the list is also updated? (i.e. they swap their indices)
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> stefia do what now?
[13:59:44] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: it's not unreasonable for me to assume you've filled out a form where different items are organized, say from 1 to 10, and the form lets you reorganize the items. say we have a=1, b=2, c=3, etc... If we update c to 1, then a should automatically be updated to 3 in the form
[13:59:52] <stef1a> something like that
[13:59:56] <BillCriswell> I think they want the options in a select element to match the order of some div elements.
[14:00:08] <stef1a> (he)
[14:00:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm still lost.
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> is BillCriswell right?
[14:01:06] <stef1a> i have a list of items that appear in a certain order, and i want the user to be able to reorder them with dropdown selects where each option represents a possible position of the item
[14:01:28] <robertmaxrees> my confusion is the "list" - is this a <ul>?
[14:01:35] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: not necessarily.
[14:02:00] <stef1a> BillCriswell is correct except the currently selected option is the item's position
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> you can move elements around just fine.
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> using stuff like .after()
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> and insertAfter()
[14:02:48] <stef1a> no no
[14:03:02] <stef1a> i don't want to change the actual appearance -- that will be taken care of when the form is submitted
[14:03:15] <stef1a> i just want to change the selected options for the _other_ items in the list
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> then where is the order changing?
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> aaah you want to change values in selects?
[14:03:31] <stef1a> yes!
[14:03:32] <BillCriswell> stef1a: So like [ [ 1 V ] I am the first item ] [ [ 2 V ] I am the second item ] then when you change 2 to 1 it puts it at the 1st position?
[14:03:44] <BillCriswell> [ 1 V ] = ASCII select.
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> stef1a there's no "resource" as far as I'm aware.
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> stefi shouldn't be too hard to write something like that yourself though.
[14:04:26] <stef1a> okay. like i said, all i want to do is change the selected option of c=3 if i update the option of a=1 to a=3
[14:04:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:04:39] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy to do.
[14:04:42] <stef1a> yeah i think that shouldn't be too hard now that i've spitballed it around with you guys
[14:04:46] <stef1a> thanks!
[14:04:46] <robertmaxrees> you'd use the change event.
[14:05:23] <BillCriswell> (o) = ASCII radio.
[14:05:26] <BillCriswell> This could be fun.
[14:05:36] <BillCriswell> [         ] = input.
[14:08:28] <cjwelborn> ▁▃▅▇█▃ = ascii bar graph.
[14:08:49] <cjwelborn> except its not ascii.
[14:09:41] <matrixdevuk> Guys, lammy is a spam bot
[14:09:44] <matrixdevuk> Ban it
[14:09:53] <matrixdevuk> It spammed me earlier with a .es site
[14:09:55] <cjwelborn> Yes, I got the spam from lammy too.
[14:09:59] <robertmaxrees> gracias.
[14:10:02] <robertmaxrees> taking care of it.
[14:10:20] <stef1a> matrixdevuk: can confirm
[14:10:37] <robertmaxrees> hah vladikoff again
[14:10:43] <matrixdevuk> I'm trying to get them klined by freenode
[14:11:03] <matrixdevuk> vladikoff is using textual!
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> you said that earlier >.>
[14:11:15] <matrixdevuk> did I?
[14:11:26] <matrixdevuk> kden
[14:11:32] <robertmaxrees> woah nvm that was somebody else.
[14:14:22] <Bray90820_> robertmaxrees: Could I also put the lightbox in an area tag
[14:14:32] <hellhound> hey guys, in which cases when binding an ajaxSuccess event the response's headers get completely wipeout?
[14:15:10] <robertmaxrees> Bray90820_ nope. area is empty.
[14:15:24] <robertmaxrees> you could bind a listener to manually launch stuff though
[14:15:44] <Bray90820_> robertmaxrees: my bad I ment an image map
[14:16:08] <robertmaxrees> not gonna change my answer >.>
[14:16:24] <Bray90820_> Image maps arn't blank tho
[14:16:37] <robertmaxrees> image maps take <area> tags and invisible content.
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're trying to do :)
[14:17:34] <Bray90820_> I basically want to make an invisible link to a lightbox
[14:17:59] <matrixdevuk> ...
[14:18:03] <Bray90820_> I guess I could just try it out and see if it works
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> you want to click an <area> and have that launch a lightbox?
[14:18:11] <hellhound> btw guys, is there a way to get the request's URI from a jXHR object?
[14:18:13] <Bray90820_> Yes
[14:18:21] <matrixdevuk> <a style="color: transparent">
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> Bray90820_ yeah, so use event listeners and bind to the various clicks.
[14:19:20] <Bray90820_> matrixdevuk: If I do that tho I can't have absolute placement
[14:19:33] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk that's not what i mean by "transparent content"
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Transparent_content_model
[14:19:39] <Bray90820_> robertmaxrees: I wanted just part of an image clickable
[14:19:53] <Bray90820_> If you were to look at the image it makes sense
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> sure - you need an image map, and then bind to the area's click event.
[14:20:48] <Bray90820_> I so totally thought you said blind
[14:20:51] <Bray90820_> \my bad again
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:21:23] <Bray90820_> I think I am good now
[14:21:27] <robertmaxrees> mmk
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> modern.ie makes my life so much easier these days
[14:53:07] <setRed> hello
[14:53:30] <droid909> guys is slideDown() 'whenable'?  $.when($('#elem').slideDown()).then(function( goes after slidedown animation finished  ));
[14:54:41] <robertmaxrees> iirs it's deferred, yeah.
[14:55:06] <robertmaxrees> also the second arg is a done callback as well.
[14:55:13] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .done().
[14:55:53] <droid909> robertmaxrees: hmm, i never used .done is it the same?
[14:56:00] <droid909> can you show an example?
[14:56:01] <robertmaxrees> droid909 the same as what?
[14:56:02] <droid909> please
[14:56:21] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it...
[14:56:23] <droid909> robertmaxrees: as $.when
[14:56:41] <robertmaxrees> $('#elem').slideDown().done(function() { /* your code here */ });
[14:56:50] <thinkxl> droid909: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:56:53] <thinkxl> here are some examples
[14:56:56] <droid909> robertmaxrees: ohh, that is awesome thanks
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> it's the deferred/promises setup.\
[14:58:19] <robertmaxrees> the docs are a helluva drug.
[15:10:48] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees
[15:10:54] <matrixdevuk> I have a query
[15:11:01] <matrixdevuk> Here it goes:
[15:11:13] <matrixdevuk> var arr = cmds[value]();
[15:11:22] <matrixdevuk> returns {"0":"hi"};
[15:11:26] <matrixdevuk> then
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:11:40] <matrixdevuk> I can't do: arr.forEach(k, v){ console.log(v); };
[15:11:46] <robertmaxrees> fiddle please
[15:11:47] <thinkxl> lol
[15:11:59] <matrixdevuk> that's literally all i have
[15:12:01] <matrixdevuk> lol
[15:12:11] <robertmaxrees> your array isn't an array, sooo.
[15:12:18] <matrixdevuk> ook
[15:12:21] <matrixdevuk> how do i make it one ok
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> and what you've given me is not valiud JS
[15:12:40] <robertmaxrees> fill in the holes :)
[15:13:54] <matrixdevuk> pls tell me how to forEach a json array and correct my return array/object whatever
[15:13:56] <matrixdevuk> lol
[15:14:00] <robertmaxrees> JSON Array?
[15:14:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:14:05] <matrixdevuk> ye
[15:14:17] <matrixdevuk> how to maik json array
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you can for...in on objects or use an iterator/forEach() on an array.
[15:14:34] <robertmaxrees> what's your data?
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> are we assuming what you gave me earlier?
[15:15:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g7bvuv7f/
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> there is a sublte (but important) difference.
[15:16:08] <droid909> robertmaxrees: so .then is lie .done but .then also have a function in case of failure, right? that is the difference?
[15:16:14] <droid909> lie =like
[15:16:36] <robertmaxrees> droid909 .fail() and .done() both exist.
[15:16:41] <robertmaxrees> go read the docs about deferred objects.
[15:17:14] <droid909> robertmaxrees: yes, i'm reading, i just wanted to confirm the difference between .then and .done
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk part of the issue is objects are key/value pairs, while arrays are indexed values.
[15:17:41] <robertmaxrees> droid909 you're convoluting stuff.
[15:18:11] <droid909> robertmaxrees: convoluting?
[15:18:20] <droid909> in what sence?
[15:18:37] <droid909> sense
[15:18:48] <robertmaxrees> .when is for queues of stuff.
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> .done() is for a single callback.
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[15:19:07] <droid909> aha, got it, thanks
[15:19:16] <matrixdevuk> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:19:20] <matrixdevuk> Saved me, once again ;D
[15:19:29] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk not sure what you're asking at this point, but opkay.
[15:19:49] <matrixdevuk> Well, you still got me on the right tracks
[15:19:49] <matrixdevuk> lol
[15:19:53] <matrixdevuk> So, thank you!
[15:19:54] <matrixdevuk> ;D
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk even better - arrays ARE objects.
[15:20:13] <robertmaxrees> they just have special keys.
[15:20:49] <matrixdevuk> well, i got it working 'cuz you
[15:20:52] <matrixdevuk> ty :)
[15:20:52] <robertmaxrees> kay
[15:20:55] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing?
[15:21:00] <robertmaxrees> because there is a right way and a wrong way.
[15:26:52] <robertmaxrees> matrixdevuk http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g7bvuv7f/2/
[15:27:03] <matrixdevuk> robertmaxrees I already got it btw
[15:27:23] <robertmaxrees> what did you wind up doing?
[15:27:28] <robertmaxrees> you said that but didn't show me what you needed.
[15:28:12] <robertmaxrees> there are good ways and bad ways to do these kinds of things, which is why i'm asking matrixdevuk
[15:28:22] <matrixdevuk> I had to remove the key
[15:28:39] <robertmaxrees> show me what you did?

[15:37:09] <John3k> Hello!
[15:38:21] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:42:42] <John3k> I'm planning to use jQuery Waypoints combined with animate.css to let my blog entries fade in when the user scrolls to them. My problem is that all blog entries get animated because they all use the same class name. How can I animate each entry when they hit the viewport without using unique class names for each entry? http://pastebin.com/5YU69k4s
[15:43:01] <robertmaxrees> detect which one is currently visible.
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> and/or do an .each() and set waypoints for each one separately.
[15:43:41] <John3k> hm, i thought I am doing that with Waypoints.js
[15:44:04] <John3k> ok , i will read the doc on that thanks
[15:44:14] <robertmaxrees> no idea how waypoints works, but you need to be able to tie each waypoint back to the addClass()
[15:49:32] <matrixdevuk> imma be upgradin' to yosemite beta 2
[15:52:11] <phoenixsun> I have realised that the Chrome JS console can't show objects
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> sure it can.
[15:52:22] <phoenixsun> oh?
[15:52:36] <phoenixsun> well I have seen it write [object, object]
[15:52:39] <phoenixsun> etc
[15:52:46] <phoenixsun> but I don't know whats in them
[15:52:47] <robertmaxrees> how are you writing the objects out?
[15:53:01] <phoenixsun> console.log(array)
[15:53:07] <phoenixsun> and its an array of objects
[15:53:08] <John3k> robertmaxrees, thanks i got it :)
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> John3k cool
[15:53:32] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun have an example?
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> because you should be able to browse through it just fine.
[15:53:58] <phoenixsun> you want to see the output?
[15:54:01] <robertmaxrees> the array
[15:54:11] <phoenixsun> it doesn't show anymore
[15:54:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:54:44] <phoenixsun> it used  to show [object, object, object] etc
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> click on that
[15:55:36] <phoenixsun> now that its an array like [ [object, object] [object, object]] and it shows nothing now
[15:55:56] <phoenixsun> its working fine though
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> huh
[15:56:10] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're tyring to say
[15:56:22] <phoenixsun> the array is working the way I want it to
[15:56:29] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/H1i4lGp.png <- click on the thing
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> you click on the object in the console.
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> you can browse it that way.
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> it doens't write out a string for you.
[15:56:53] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[15:57:12] <phoenixsun> let me look at it again quickly
[15:57:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/11z69a30/1/
[15:58:41] <phoenixsun> yeah I see that you can look inside it in the example you have shown me
[15:58:54] <phoenixsun> that you can the option to click and drill down
[15:59:05] <phoenixsun> I never remember seeing that in my console
[15:59:19] <phoenixsun> when it was a simple array of objects it used to show obj
[15:59:47] <phoenixsun> now that is an array of arrays of shows nothing in the console
[16:00:08] <phoenixsun> maybe if I output one of the objects it would work
[16:00:11] <phoenixsun> I will try that now
[16:01:26] <chee> jquery color example on https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ is brok

[16:01:31] <chee> 4 me
[16:03:52] <morenoh149> I have an htmlstring. How do I get a string of the words that aren't in html tags. aka the copy of the webpage?
[16:05:20] <zzaichik> you're trying to pull some text out of your webpage?
[16:05:23] <zzaichik> .text();
[16:05:45] <morenoh149> zzaichik: thanks
[16:05:51] <zzaichik> np
[16:13:20] <morenoh149> zzaichik: seems like .text() still return javascript on certain pages
[16:13:37] <morenoh149> i'm building this wordgrep.org
[16:14:00] <morenoh149> if you do cyclingforums.com search for 'api' it'll return true
[16:14:14] <morenoh149> it's search the js on that page as well
[16:18:43] <morenoh149> is there a quick way to assign '$' to jquery in chrome dev tools?
[16:18:52] <morenoh149> say I want to use jquery on a random site I visit
[16:20:47] <zzaichik> morenoh149: is this what you're trying to do?  http://jsfiddle.net/gntvd49b/
[16:21:06] <zzaichik> grab text from an element?
[16:22:35] <zzaichik> Or more general: http://jsfiddle.net/gntvd49b/1/
[16:23:11] <morenoh149> zzaichik: mmm nope I'm building wordgrep.org
[16:23:39] <morenoh149> it grabs the html from a whole bunch of sites and searches for a pattern within their copy
[16:24:05] <morenoh149> but for certain sites like cyclcingforums.com the jquery .text() method returns the copy and some javascript
[16:24:10] <morenoh149> I'd like just the copy
[16:25:15] <stan_man_can> I have an array of elements that I want to loop through every time the user presses the space bar
[16:25:18] <stan_man_can> any way to do this?
[16:25:50] <morenoh149> stan_man_can: http://devdocs.io/jquery/keypress
[16:26:10] <tejas-manohar> is it possible to programmatically register and login to a github account?
[16:26:15] <stan_man_can> morenoh149: i know that I just don’t know how to iterate through the array only on the key press
[16:27:02] <morenoh149> stan_man_can: $(document).ready(function() {
[16:28:51] <morenoh149> hmm I though you could bind keypress to the body :/
[16:29:34] <stan_man_can> morenoh149: I don’t mind if we have to detect it based on the textbox
[16:30:02] <morenoh149> $(document).keypress(function(event) { // you can do it on the document would be the whole page
[16:30:14] <stan_man_can> the current element in the array will populate the text box, user wiill hit space and it will move on to the next item in the array
[16:31:19] <morenoh149> okay so bind keypress to the input field
[16:31:25] <morenoh149> what else is the problem?
[16:31:57] <morenoh149> tejas-manohar: if you know the credentials then yes
[16:37:24] <tejas-manohar> morenoh149: how would i go about that? not in code just logically like what methedology
[16:40:08] <morenoh149> tejas-manohar: well you're best off using something like oauth or their api. But if you can do it in a browser you can always script a headless browser
[16:40:18] <morenoh149> tejas-manohar: what do you want to do?
[16:41:12] <tejas-manohar> morenoh149: building a small bot to do some small stuffl, just for play not for public use or anything dont want gh to be mad more for fun
[16:41:22] <morenoh149> just found out about the jqueryify chrome extension. it's sick
[16:41:23] <tejas-manohar> im more looking at registering
[16:41:30] <tejas-manohar> i can auth programmatically for sure
[16:41:53] <morenoh149> tejas-manohar: oh like a bot that registers accounts on github?
[16:42:22] <tejas-manohar> morenoh149: well registering is a first step it doesnt just do that
[16:42:27] <tejas-manohar> that would be puer spam lol
[16:42:36] <tejas-manohar> but yeah i need to register an account in the bot process
[16:42:41] <tejas-manohar> should i just build a spider
[16:42:43] <tejas-manohar> with lioke cheerio?
[16:43:45] <morenoh149> i think http://phantomjs.org/
[16:43:56] <morenoh149> basically a headless scriptable browser
[16:45:45] <robertmaxrees> weee
[16:45:47] <robertmaxrees> workbeer!
[16:46:15] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: so like the early days of Facebook then
[16:46:24] <phoenixsun> coding and beer
[16:46:24] <robertmaxrees> we've been around for a while ;)
[16:46:40] <phoenixsun> thats true
[16:46:45] <phoenixsun> are you in gmt time?
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> PST
[16:47:07] <phoenixsun> ah thats a lot better then
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[17:00:42] <tejas-manohar> anyone know lots about proxies?
[17:00:53] <robertmaxrees> what kind of proxies?
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar you mean like http://api.jquery.com/jquery.proxy/ ?
[17:03:09] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: well, its a mix of node and jq in an app right now and interacts with both
[17:03:21] <tejas-manohar> basically,  im building a small application that allows you to compare stars on github of two users
[17:03:24] <tejas-manohar> like what theyve starred
[17:03:33] <tejas-manohar> and then you can auth and star from their list
[17:03:37] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with proxies?
[17:03:43] <tejas-manohar> just for fun, i want it to be completely client side
[17:03:47] <tejas-manohar> “Because of some security-related limitations, Github prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application."
[17:03:49] <tejas-manohar> https://github.com/tejas-manohar/gatekeeper
[17:04:07] <tejas-manohar> ive deployed this to https://compstar.herokuapp.com/
[17:04:16] <tejas-manohar> and im going to host the main app on github pages
[17:04:25] <robertmaxrees> still not following where proxies come into play.
[17:04:25] <tejas-manohar> look at the oauth steps, where do i send the reqeusts from?
[17:04:32] <tejas-manohar> the gatekeeper thing is a proxy per se
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:05:14] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: u see what i mean?
[17:05:30] <robertmaxrees> kind of offtopic for the room.
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> =/
[17:05:52] <tejas-manohar> ugh
[17:05:55] <tejas-manohar> you think youll be able to help?
[17:05:58] <tejas-manohar> i can pm?
[17:06:01] <robertmaxrees> but the repo's readme has instructions for you.
[17:06:02] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:06:48] <robertmaxrees> this is pretty cut and dry though
[17:07:29] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: i read the instructinos
[17:07:35] <tejas-manohar> where do i GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize from?
[17:07:39] <tejas-manohar> teh client side app on github pages?
[17:07:49] <tejas-manohar> isnt a GET just anything like an a href on a button
[17:08:01] <tejas-manohar> how does oauth/authorize know which app im authing with>?
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> the heroku side
[17:08:47] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: hmmm, how woukld i play that out?
[17:08:51] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:08:55] <tejas-manohar> me neither lol
[17:09:06] <robertmaxrees> still off topic either way =/
[17:09:10] <tejas-manohar> users would go to heroku app and then click auth and the rest of their stuff would happen in gh pages?
[17:09:11] <robertmaxrees> good luck though
[17:09:13] <tejas-manohar> thanks
[17:21:53] <John3k> ohh no i figured out that my visitor won't see any content if js is disabled because content isn't visible by default :D
[17:22:51] <John3k> opacity: 0; by default and get's 1 on animation
[17:22:52] <John3k> hmm
[17:23:03] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[17:24:33] <John3k> maybe i should add the hidden class with js
[17:24:44] <robertmaxrees> depends on what all you're doing, but yeah.
[17:24:52] <robertmaxrees> couple different ways to handle that.
[17:25:03] <John3k> i guess, i'll try that one first :)
[17:29:12] <John3k> hm no this won't work because the content is visible for a seconds before it gets hidden by js
[17:29:16] <John3k> looks odd
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> <noscript> tags.
[17:30:36] <John3k> maybe load the css that includes the hide class in <noscript>
[17:30:46] <robertmaxrees> or just put your style tag in there.
[17:30:52] <John3k> or that^^
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> or don't to the fade thing./
[17:30:55] <John3k> i'll try
[17:31:15] <John3k> i like fading it a little :)
[17:31:18] <robertmaxrees> eh
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid it if you can.
[17:34:10] <John3k> because of what type of reasons? compatibility ?
[17:34:21] <John3k> or the "annoying factor"?
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> you're making me wait to use your site.
[17:34:35] <John3k> got you
[17:36:35] <John3k> your solution works nice, thx
[17:36:46] <robertmaxrees> fsho

[18:51:14] <tejas-manohar> hey im building an app that auths with github’s api (well through oauth github thing)
[18:51:18] <tejas-manohar> how do i test it locally?
[20:24:12] <BlackHorn> can anyone help me? i'm trying to get my div to show and hide on clicking a link and then to disappear when i click my overlay, but it's not registering clicks. I've tried a few things and it's not working. Maybe someone can help me do it? i know it's a simple thing to do. my code is here. http://pastebin.com/tVEVcb0H
[20:29:13] <BlackHorn> sorry, disconnected, anyone got any help?
[21:26:23] <chriys> hey guys
[21:26:23] <chriys> do you know how to simulate 500 connection to my website watching a link I want to test my server.
[21:28:07] <SebastianSML> with php you can do this: header("HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server Error");
[21:29:34] <SebastianSML> look at here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4162223/how-to-send-500-internal-server-error-error-from-a-php-script
[21:39:53] <Woet> chriys: https://www.google.com/search?q=load+testing
[21:40:07] <Woet> SebastianSML: pretty sure he meant 500 connections, not a 500 error
[21:40:26] <benlieb> I'm calling the following funciton on ready(), which predictably displays the bootstrap tooltip. I now am needing to have tooltips work on ajax-loaded content as well. How would I re-write this to allow new ajax-loaded elements to have the proper behavior: https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/e7c419761ba9c30f94a4
[21:40:47] <SebastianSML> my bad :) it's too early morning for me :)
[21:41:09] <benlieb> Would I have to call this in every ajax success method?
[21:42:18] <chriys> thx Woet
[23:51:06] <HowardwLo> ello!
[23:51:11] <HowardwLo> I need some assistance: https://dpaste.de/6LgE
[23:51:34] <HowardwLo> I am trying to check if #product_holder exists in the ajax response data
[23:51:46] <HowardwLo> its coming back as undefined, even though i see it in the elms log
[23:57:29] <HowardwLo> anyone? :)
