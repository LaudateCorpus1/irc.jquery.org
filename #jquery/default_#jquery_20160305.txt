[02:10:15] <hellyeah> hey
[02:10:25] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[04:55:33] <gauravgrover95> I am finding difficulty implementing AJAX in jquery? Can someone help
[05:29:51] <afmza> does anyone know of some documentation that can show me how to apply css to a hyperlink depending on the current route with sammyJs?
[05:37:51] <berpcor|2> Hello. I need help.
[05:37:52] <berpcor|2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[05:37:57] <berpcor|2> Doesn't work.
[05:38:04] <berpcor|2> I need to get array values from URL.
[05:38:22] <berpcor|2> http://site.com/some?arr[fasdf][agasdf]=3
[05:38:38] <berpcor|2> I need arr[fasdf][agasdf]=3
[05:38:59] <berpcor|2> Array may be of any depth
[05:39:04] <berpcor|2> I can have many arrays
[05:54:11] <berpcor|2> Anyone here?
[06:35:28] <pickandmix> $("#countdown").attr("src", "{{url_for ('static', filename = "'lib/images/'+count+'.png'")}}"); Can anyone see what's wrong with my code?
[06:35:46] <pickandmix> It's outputting this GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/%27lib/images/%27+count+%27.png%27 404 (NOT FOUND)
[06:36:03] <pickandmix> I don't understand the %27? and my count is supposed to be at 4
[06:38:33] <Minu> %27 is ' character i js
[06:38:35] <Minu> *in
[06:40:03] <pickandmix> Minu: is my code correct, at the '+count+' part
[06:53:27] <Minu> pickandmix: try it this way $("#countdown").attr("src", "{{url_for ('static', filename = "lib/images/"+count+".png")}}");
[06:53:37] <Minu> this is right
[06:55:01] <Minu> did you get it?
[07:48:52] <pickandmix> Minu: So sorry!
[07:49:05] <pickandmix> Minu: I didn't have any notification, I just did a hardcode method instead :/
[07:49:35] <pickandmix> Minu: But I'm pretty sure I tried your that line before. It doesn't work too
[08:33:13] <Minu> pickandmix try it now
[08:33:26] <Minu> i just tried it and it worked
[09:42:30] <puchacz> hi, I know jquery does not officially support svg
[09:42:35] <puchacz> what should I use then please?
[09:42:50] <puchacz> this? http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[09:43:04] <puchacz> it is not on official list of plugins either
[10:05:26] <decx> d3.js
[10:09:01] <puchacz> decx: but isn't d3.js (1) separate from jquery and (2) oriented towards charts?
[10:09:09] <puchacz> rather than general graphics?
[10:09:23] <decx> it is separate
[10:09:35] <decx> it's not for charts
[10:09:42] <decx> it's for visualizations
[10:10:39] <decx> in the end you draw lines, polygons, rects and circles
[10:11:28] <puchacz> decx: my use case is as follows: load up a raster image (say png or jpg) and let user draw rectangles on it
[10:11:28] <decx> apart from doing legwork with d3, snap.svg seems to be popular
[10:12:18] <puchacz> but I don't want canvas as I want to send full data to back to server of what user is drawing, so feels like I need DOM
[10:12:30] <decx> why
[10:12:39] <puchacz> why send to server?
[10:12:46] <decx> why not just send rect data
[10:13:11] <decx> "here server, this images is 100x100 and a rect with with w and height h is at x,y
[10:13:33] <puchacz> you are right, it will be just rectangle data, but it feels as if with canvas I would have harder time to remove or move rectangle in browser prior to submit
[10:13:42] <decx> not really
[10:14:04] <puchacz> semi transparent rectangle, sketch it first, then adjust position, then hit submit
[10:14:26] <puchacz> would you use svg or canvas for it?
[10:14:33] <decx> canvas
[10:14:41] <puchacz> directly or any specific library?
[10:15:00] <decx> send imagedata to canvas, catch mousedown events to start drawing rects, catch mouseup to stop drawing rects
[10:15:13] <decx> and then on submit just send the array with the rect data
[10:15:42] <decx> old similar approach for cropping
[10:15:43] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/g4mgh965/12/
[10:16:21] <puchacz> yes, but my understanding is that it does not remember what was under the rectangle, it is no longer image with rectangle atop of it, but merged raster data. wouldn't I need to "remember myself"  what was below the rectangle to allow for it to be moved?
[10:16:59] <puchacz> ah, ok, I will analyse your example
[10:17:00] <puchacz> thanks
[10:17:15] <decx> looking back on it it's not really relevant after all ^^
[10:17:28] <decx> just remembered doing rects on images a few months ago ^^
[10:17:51] <puchacz> not relevant?
[10:17:51] <decx> you have the raster data of your image
[10:18:03] <decx> what you draw on a canvas doesnt matter
[10:18:23] <decx> what you draw doesnt matter, you just need to save the rect data
[10:18:36] <puchacz> good
[10:18:40] <decx> did i mention that what you draw doesnt matter
[10:18:41] <decx> ^^
[10:18:49] <decx> i'm in a loop help
[10:19:00] <puchacz> decx: break :-)
[10:19:03] <puchacz> you are out of the loop now
[10:19:25] <decx> bad news, i was in a higher order function, you should have returned :)
[10:19:54] <puchacz> my further flow was supposed to send data to server and use some linux programs like imagemagic to make changes on image as user requested
[10:20:06] <puchacz> but this is really relevant, so just letting you know
[10:20:11] <puchacz> irrelevant I mean
[10:20:49] <decx> i dont even know why you want to draw rectangles on images ^^
[10:20:59] <puchacz> it does not matter, does it ;) ?
[10:21:05] <decx> well yeah it does
[10:21:30] <puchacz> user will select parts of image to have "annotations" on it or to extract parts of images as separate ones.
[10:21:45] <decx> right
[10:21:53] <puchacz> by annotation you can imagine a picture of a dragonfly and somebody selects a part and says "it is abdomen"
[10:21:56] <decx> so you only want image dimensions and rect dimensions and position
[10:22:06] <decx> with that data you can do everything you want serverside
[10:22:10] <decx> be it crop or whatever
[10:22:22] <decx> but there's no need to change your image before sending it to the server
[10:22:35] <puchacz> no, only to give transient feedback on selection
[10:22:44] <puchacz> but not literally change png in client
[10:22:50] <decx> right that's why you draw on canvas
[10:23:08] <puchacz> okay, so my svg explorations were completely misguided, correct?
[10:23:21] <decx> you can do the same thing with svg
[10:23:30] <decx> i just like canvas ;)
[10:23:34] <puchacz> okay
[10:24:19] <puchacz> I started playing with svg but I discovered jquery is not really supporting it and I need to give exact dimensions to image prior to any rendering
[10:24:59] <puchacz> svg feels alien when embedded in html, but my mileage is just few hours
[10:33:17] <puchacz> decx: do I need this for canvas please? http://projects.calebevans.me/jcanvas/
[10:34:50] <decx> you dont need anything
[10:35:07] <decx> if you dont want to get into canvas or svg why dont you just draw spans?
[10:35:12] <decx> or divs
[10:35:35] <puchacz> it is not that I dont want to, I am sitting on a fence where to invest my time :-)
[10:35:58] <decx> have an image container div with the image and when you mousedown on it draw divs at these positions absolutely and save the coordinates
[10:36:13] <puchacz> this could work
[10:37:24] <puchacz> actually, I don't want divs - what if I want to upgrade my "selection" tool later to let user draw a "lasso" around a part of image rather than rectangle
[10:37:51] <puchacz> is svg and canvas equally suitable for "lasso/freehand" selection?
[10:38:19] <puchacz> server would get a series of points where mouse travelled
[10:38:24] <puchacz> probably easy with both
[10:38:39] <puchacz> and temporary feedback on selection in browser?
[10:38:57] <decx> well you catch mouse positions while you're drawing
[10:39:09] <decx> and then use that as polygon points in svg or canvas
[11:19:01] <chrisml> should i use jasmine or mocha? idk
[11:28:45] <uagarwal744_> Hi, I'm interested in contributing to jQuery Mobile - Bug Hunt and/or jQuery UI - Native select button for GSoC'16. Any advice for what should be my first step?
[16:38:29] <albedoa> style question: if i have var items = $(".items"); should i prepend my variable with a dollar sign like $items?
[16:39:56] <Minu> albedoa: i don't think so
[16:40:06] <albedoa> Minu thanks
[16:40:24] <Minu> you're welcome
[16:40:25] <Uhkis> albedoa: coders choice, i do that to differentiate jquery objects for other vars
[16:40:32] <Uhkis> from*
[16:40:56] <albedoa> Uhkis cool, thank you
[17:24:08] <acidjazz> i never do that
[17:24:12] <acidjazz> too phpy
[17:24:18] <acidjazz> even though i like php
[17:46:06] <Cypris> i've noticed a lot of <select> replacements hide the actual select element and use ul/li, div/span, etc.. styled to look and act like select with better functionality. I cannot seem to find a way to disable them though. For example, once an item is selected, a form is populated. Beyond read-only form tasks, the select list needs to be locked and until user clicks either save or cancel. any ideas? right now i'm working with js-listbox.
[17:51:16] <Cypris> or rather.. instead of dicking with js-listbox.. if someone knows a styleable jq listbox that allows you to lock the currently selected item, thats fine too
[17:57:22] <Cypris> i'm not being impatient in asking this.. just curious, is anyone paying attention to this chat room?
[17:58:16] <shoky> sometimes
[18:01:16] <Cypris> And there was one.
[18:05:21] <shoky> Cypris: you can disable the <select> with selected attribute,and a good select replacement should read that, and should have a way to disable/enable
[18:05:44] <shoky> Cypris: e.g. select2 lets you do that
[18:06:28] <Cypris> o
[18:07:03] <Cypris> oops. I mean I'll have to check that out. I found jqxListBox which does it too.
[19:10:14] <sofly> hey guys, I’m trying to use the basic example of appendTo() and it’s just doing nothing, and not throwing any errors
[19:10:17] <sofly> is this something anyone’s seen?
[19:10:28] <sofly> have a document on click that works great, another element is being appended (an <input>)
[19:10:30] <sofly> $("<p>Test</p>").append('.ingredient-list');
[19:10:40] <sofly> that line does absolutely nothing, and is ripped directly out of the docs lol
[19:11:59] <shoky> sofly: you used appendTo
[19:12:08] <shoky> sofly: er i mean, append
[19:12:34] <sofly> ah yeah, shoky that was a typo… appendTo doesn’t work :(
[19:12:52] <sofly> $("<p>Test</p>").appendTo('.ingredient-list');
[19:13:00] <sofly> that’s what is in my code, and it still doens’t append the <p>
[19:13:15] <shoky> sofly: that should work fine, if the selector is right and the element exists at the time you run that
[19:13:27] <sofly> yeah, it should. hmm very odd
[19:13:45] <shoky> sofly: https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/g4w8ek14/
[19:14:13] <sofly> yep shoky
[19:14:38] <sofly> lemme send you the entire bit of code
[19:14:39] <sofly> sec
[19:14:56] <shoky> make a jsfiddle that shows the problem
[19:15:31] <sofly> uh ok
[19:27:12] <sofly> i guess here so far shoky, but absolutely none of it works
[19:27:13] <sofly> https://jsfiddle.net/137Lhm6u/2/
[19:27:21] <sofly> it should add 2 inputs and a “test” if you click on the “add” div
[19:28:31] <sofly> in my application locally, the 2 inputs append OK, but the “Test” doesn't
[19:29:27] <shoky> sofly: check your console. you have a syntax error on line 7
[19:29:53] <shoky> sofly: and after you fix that, fix your selector in line 1
[19:30:15] <sofly> okay those 2 fixed: https://jsfiddle.net/137Lhm6u/4/
[19:30:32] <sofly> thanks lol, those were both from me translating the garbage code to try to make it more readable :(
[19:30:42] <shoky> check your console.
[19:30:53] <sofly> yeah, i’m looking at the console.
[19:31:03] <sofly> “index” is missing, i can remove that for now.. one sec
[19:31:39] <sofly> ok
[19:31:40] <shoky> and you have another bad selector.
[19:32:04] <sofly> … yeah
[19:32:09] <sofly> that 2nd bad selector might do it
[19:32:10] <sofly> :
[19:32:13] <sofly> https://jsfiddle.net/137Lhm6u/7/
[19:32:14] <sofly> wow
[19:32:23] <sofly> rough times for me here
[19:32:24] <sofly> hahahhaha
[19:32:28] <sofly> thank you shoky for babying me :)
[19:32:53] <shoky> np ;p  hope you learned to check your console and your selectors :D
[19:33:35] <sofly> yeah, the selectors is the big one for me
[19:33:40] <sofly> shaking my head at myself, haha

[23:43:24] <copyjosh> Have a gulp file that among other things, optimizes all images an 'assets' folder and puts them in a public directory. .  in this public directory though is a folder for user uploads. When gulp is run, the contents of this folder are dropped. From google, I find that there is a way to ignore directories, but have not found an answer to this problem.
[23:58:09] <acidjazz> copyjosh: lets see that gulp code of the image optimization
[23:58:25] <acidjazz> waddya mean ignore the folder
