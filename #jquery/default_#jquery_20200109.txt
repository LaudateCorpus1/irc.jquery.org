[02:59:53] <dimi1947> is there any easy way to download all these at once or do I have to go one by ome:https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/themes/base/images
[03:00:14] <Cork> dimi1947: git clone?
[03:02:01] <dimi1947> I do not see git clone anywhere in the page
[03:02:31] <Cork> command line tool?
[03:02:41] <Cork> as in how you download a git reop
[03:02:45] <Cork> *repo
[03:03:20] <dimi1947> I shouldd it fork it first
[03:03:46] <Cork> no, not unless you want to modify it
[03:04:02] <Cork> just clone the read-only https address
[03:04:37] <dimi1947> I do nor know how to do that with an editor(vim etc)
[03:04:46] <Cork> you don't
[03:05:46] <Cork> but sure, download them one by one from the github web ui, it sounds like it is the easiest for you
[03:06:28] <dimi1947> I do not know how to clone...I do use VIM but my understanddingg of it is limited...so I will go wi the latter
[03:06:44] <Cork> git is not a vim command...
[03:08:44] <Cork> (but seriously, how can you be a developer and not know what git is...)
[03:09:42] <dimi1947> I know what git is of course...I am just not familiar with its commands...
[03:16:18] <Uhkis> of course git is a vim command, just use :!git ;)
[03:16:53] <Cork> :)
[03:17:03] <Cork> i meant it more as "you don't need vim to use it"
[03:17:22] <Cork> especially if you want to use it to fetch a list of files
[03:26:19] <Uhkis> of course. and i fully agree, every dev should know git, at least the basics
[03:30:28] <dimi1947> how am i going to clone the images without VIM?
[03:31:14] <dimi1947> command line tool you said...VIM is one
[03:33:42] <Uhkis> open your shell, cd to where ever you want it, git clone <url to repo> [target dir]
[03:38:10] <dimi1947> Uhkis:so this is not right according to the above  git clone https://github.com/ambicoder/jquery-ui/tree/master/themes/base/images
[03:38:28] <Cork> no, you clone the repo not a folder
[03:38:37] <dimi1947> hmmm
[03:39:24] <dimi1947> what is the correct command then?
[03:39:33] <Uhkis> git clone https://github.com/ambicoder/jquery-ui
[03:41:13] <dimi1947> yes it worked now...I must say though it is incovenient though you cannot clone a folder
[03:42:32] <Uhkis> probably because git is not a download tool
[03:42:43] <dimi1947> anyway...thanks
[03:51:56] <dimi1947> Cork:the images you pinpointed me in github does not correspond to the theme I have downloaded...where I will find the correct ones?
[03:53:55] <dimi1947> I must first find out what theme I have actually downloaded
[03:56:14] <Cork> dimi1947: the github images is the base images, it is then modified for the different themes (or the builder adjusted colors)
[03:56:40] <Cork> dimi1947: the images for a specific theme you can find in code.jqueryui.com, as long as it is a standard theme and not a custom one
[03:57:03] <dimi1947> Cork:we are talking about standard here...
[03:57:31] <dimi1947> how am I going to find out whih theme I downloaded...I cannot remember
[03:57:49] <Cork> uh... how would i know?
[03:58:22] <Cork> not like i have access to a log with what options you used in your builder config
[03:59:02] <dimi1947> I supposed the code in the files must have some related info...
[04:03:16] <dimi1947> anyway...I will investigate...
[04:28:01] <dimi1947> I found a solution after all...
[14:00:18] <z1haze> i need to hook a vuejs click event handler into a a jquery event handler function.. how would i go about doing that? eg in vue i have my own click handler, and i want to just forward that click event through to execute the jquery handler.. however jquery handlers by default always have a $(this) and the event.. so im confused
[14:01:21] <z1haze> in jquery the code is like this `const onClickAddAddress = function (e) {` and its binded with $(selector).click(onClickAddAddress)
[14:03:31] <z1haze> i know how to do like .call(this) on the function and that binds this correctly, but how do i get the event in there
[17:34:01] <ckb> @robertmaxrees, care to help me out on a complex scenario?
[17:34:15] <ckb> at a loss here
[17:34:19] <robertmaxrees> ckb if you have questions, just ask the channel - don't ping specific people :/
[17:34:41] <ckb> It's not specific to jquery
[17:34:47] <ckb> I just need someone :(
[17:35:03] <robertmaxrees> then ask in a channel suited to the topic :)
[17:35:28] <ckb> I tried asking in php, and they told me to bugger off
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> is it a PHP question?
[17:35:43] <ckb> It's more of a sysadmin question
[17:35:50] <ckb> but I don't know where to take it
[17:36:02] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome to drop it here and i can try to point you in the right direction.
[17:36:31] <ckb> even if it's not even remotely related to jq?
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:39:41] <ckb> the VOIP client I work for wants to be able to download call logs from their console. The files are stored outside of apache's directives. Is it easier for me to use apache directives on 100+ clients to access these logs (the server has a firewall that won't let anything but whitelisted IPs acceess)
[17:39:58] <ckb> the console is a seperate server
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> head over to #httpd in that case.
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> they'll be able to help.
[17:40:51] <ckb> thanks
[17:40:55] <robertmaxrees> also: i think your question got cut off.
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[17:41:14] <ckb> I don't really know how to word it.
[17:41:44] <robertmaxrees> "Is it easier for me to use apache directives on 100+ clients [...]" - easier than what, for starters ;)
[17:42:34] <ckb> see... it's not just an apache or php issue
[17:42:58] <ckb> it's like /join #logistics
[17:42:59] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd still ask in channels related to the subject :)
[17:43:12] <ckb> k thanks rob
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> *robert :)
[17:44:32] <ckb> sorry :(
[17:44:37] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good duder.
[17:44:39] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[17:44:42] <ckb> I feel super defeated right now
[17:44:51] <robertmaxrees> why??
[17:45:10] <ckb> ^^^^^
[17:45:19] <robertmaxrees> ?? because you're solving a problem?
[17:46:07] <ckb> "solving" is a bold adjective
[17:46:17] <robertmaxrees> that's what software engineering is all about though.
[17:46:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:47:09] <ckb> fair.... I just feel theres a better solution.
[17:47:22] <robertmaxrees> then what is it?
[17:47:39] <ckb> if I knew I wouldn't be here asking? :)
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> so then you feel like there MIGHT be a better solution, not that there IS one :)
[17:48:43] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there's all sorts of ways to tackle problems like this, ranging from running some kind of automated script once a day to telling the client "no".
[17:49:39] <ckb> the problem is my solution requires all 100+ client servers to update their apache config
[17:50:04] <ckb> stuff like that happens a bit?
[17:50:28] <robertmaxrees> why does the number of servers matter?  you have some kind of automated way to updating those, right?
[17:50:44] <ckb> no...
[17:50:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a great time to build one :)
[17:50:57] <ckb> I'm not getting paid enough to do that kind of stuff
[17:51:14] <robertmaxrees> that could be as simple as writing an automated script to ssh into each box and do the update.
[17:51:33] <ckb> It would work if we use the same password for each server, right?
[17:51:43] <robertmaxrees> do you use a different password for each box?
[17:51:47] <ckb> yes
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> wait, so you only have one admin account on each machine??
[17:52:23] <robertmaxrees> and not some kind of shared account that can handle the config updates?
[17:52:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like y'all have some infra updates to run at this point :) good thing you have a legit business case to go along with it.
[17:52:55] <ckb> it's a VOIP business... each business has their own box to handle inbound/outbound calls
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> so? :)
[17:53:23] <ckb> I didn't set it up :)
[17:53:27] <robertmaxrees> and?
[17:53:33] <robertmaxrees> you have a need to update it.
[17:53:54] <ckb> he doesn't have the money to do it.
[17:54:01] <ckb> he just wants the web app
[17:54:04] <robertmaxrees> then you need to tell the client no.
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:54:45] <ckb> well thank you robertmaxrees
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> tbh if any of my folks told me "i'm not going to do that because it's above my paygrade and i didn't write it."  i'd probably take a long hard look in the mirror and figure out where i failed as a manager to make them feel that wayu.
[17:55:54] <ckb> tbh, if it were me I would have 2-3 servers handling the VOIP services
[17:56:02] <ckb> for all 100+ clients
[17:56:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> virtualization is a helluva thing.
[17:56:39] <ckb> but, that's not how they have it set up.
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> sure.  sounds similar to a previous place i worked.
[17:56:54] <ckb> and they have no budget to change it
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> though not that extreme.
[17:57:22] <robertmaxrees> heh, gonna have to spend money at some point to write those admin scripts.
[17:57:23] <ckb> so, I, human, want to learn to adapt.
[17:57:50] <robertmaxrees> also have a valid case to create a shared maint. account for that kind of automated scripting.
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> anyway, got a meeting.  good luck :)
[19:43:38] <grid-> hey
[19:43:39] <grid-> quick question, https://jsbin.com/quxogewero/1/edit?html,js,output this will get the current value and the value of the previous column of where you click, but i need to get the title of the column (th) by clicking on any (tr) in the corresponding column, how i get this?
[19:43:49] <grid-> using jquery
[19:44:34] <robertmaxrees> "clicking on any tr in the corresponding column" - i think you mean "td", not tr/.
[19:45:05] <grid-> i need the th value
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> reread what i just said.
[19:45:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:45:31] <robertmaxrees> you want the corresponding th for the td you clicked, yeah?
[19:45:50] <grid-> for example when i click on Maria Anders or Francisco Chang i need to get Contact
[19:45:56] <grid-> yes
[19:46:20] <grid-> my api sets the columns dynamically so i never know if the user clicks if he clicks on the right column value
[19:46:50] <grid-> i make an if statement after it to do the actual criteria later
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> couple ways to skin this cat - if you can't change the HTML at all, you'll need to get the .index() of the clicked td, then find the corresponding td in the first tr.
[19:49:19] <grid-> https://jsbin.com/widulipabi/1/edit?html,js,output
[19:49:23] <grid-> something like this
[19:50:20] <robertmaxrees> that's... no lol
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dyr2z14g/
[19:50:34] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[19:52:11] <grid-> nice
[19:53:02] <robertmaxrees> at least if you want it to be actually abstracted.
[19:53:12] <robertmaxrees> your version seems to show that you'll know which row gets which title.
[19:57:19] <grid-> yes
[19:57:24] <robertmaxrees> so you will??
[19:58:57] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/j2adnLws/ this is something like the goal: if contact is clicked then it has to find the index of Country and it has to write console.log(); the value of the same row where you click on that's on country
[19:59:26] <robertmaxrees> huh???
[19:59:29] <robertmaxrees> you lost me.
[19:59:41] <grid-> my api generates the the columns
[19:59:46] <robertmaxrees> you said this.
[20:00:05] <grid-> so i don't know which index for the nthchild country has
[20:00:08] <robertmaxrees> "is clicked then it has to find the index of Country"
[20:00:22] <robertmaxrees> *"if contact is clicked then it has to find the index of Country"
[20:00:27] <robertmaxrees> why does it need the index of country?
[20:00:40] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to print out the entire row?
[20:01:12] <grid-> let's say if you click on a row in the column Contact then it has to console.log(); the value that's in country, but it doesn't know where country is (yet), you get me?
[20:01:39] <robertmaxrees> sure, though i guess the "why" behind that is lost on me.
[20:01:53] <grid-> so it returns the value of contact and the value of country
[20:02:00] <robertmaxrees> right, why do you need that though?
[20:03:08] <grid-> the why is this: i have an api that has column visibility so the user can set dynamic his columns to show or hide, so if it hides columns between contact and country and he clicks on contact, then the index will never be the same on country, the index can only be found with a find
[20:03:34] <robertmaxrees> are you generating this table yourself?
[20:04:00] <grid-> https://datatables.net/extensions/buttons/examples/column_visibility/simple.html
[20:04:03] <grid-> looks like this
[20:04:10] <robertmaxrees> so you're using datatables?
[20:05:11] <grid-> it's working like that but i use a different technique with datatables to show hide the columns because it's been adjusted a lot
[20:05:21] <grid-> yes
[20:05:35] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/type/column-selector
[20:05:37] <grid-> datatables has it's own api functions too
[20:05:51] <grid-> yes
[20:05:58] <robertmaxrees> just use that and call it a day then.
[20:06:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:06:53] <grid-> but i use scrollx and statesave with datatables too and with that it will clone the actual columns, so the index will be lost until you will search like you did with jquery again for it
[20:07:09] <robertmaxrees> did you read the page I just linked?
[20:07:14] <grid-> yes i know it
[20:07:34] <robertmaxrees> you can select columns by name.
[20:09:04] <grid-> are you able to return the value of country here https://jsfiddle.net/j2adnLws/ ? between the ( ... } of the first find of contact?
[20:09:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not using datatables.
[20:09:40] <grid-> no but it's using the same dom structure
[20:09:48] <robertmaxrees> datatables has a method to do what you want.
[20:09:50] <grid-> datatables just makes tables too
[20:10:22] <robertmaxrees> it has a way for you to select by column name.
[20:10:25] <robertmaxrees> why not use that?
[20:13:42] <grid-> tried this on my #example2 table: https://datatables.net/reference/api/column().header() (but that didn't work)
[20:13:55] <robertmaxrees> why didn't it work?
[20:14:07] <robertmaxrees> Were you getting an error of some kind?
[20:14:26] <grid-> and the jquery functions not datatables oriented are working fine
[20:14:33] <grid-> i don't really know exactly
[20:14:55] <robertmaxrees> so your solution wasn't to fix what was broken, but instead try to reimplement core datatables functionality?
[20:14:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:15:11] <robertmaxrees> tbh - i'd go back and get the datatables stuff working correctly instead.
[20:15:36] <grid-> yes and no, i need a solution now, i'm on a timeline that it would have been fixed already :)
[20:15:46] <grid-> if it's working i will go for the datatables way
[20:15:53] <robertmaxrees> go that direction.,
[20:15:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of hacking around it.
[20:16:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll wind up with more, bigger headaches.
[20:17:02] <grid-> ok but can you give me a change to let me show here https://jsfiddle.net/j2adnLws/ to repeat on the previous code to write the value of country to console.log?
[20:17:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:17:28] <robertmaxrees> are you asking me to write more code?
[20:17:37] <grid-> so it's fund the correspondening eq of country
[20:18:00] <robertmaxrees> lol so you want an "example"?
[20:18:05] <grid-> s/it's fund/it will found
[20:18:09] <grid-> yes
[20:18:21] <robertmaxrees> that's... not how this channel works :/
[20:18:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't do dev work for free, compadre.
[20:19:22] <grid-> ok
[21:07:50] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/t7r6yw45/ can anyone help me with line 13? i need the value of the correspondending eq
