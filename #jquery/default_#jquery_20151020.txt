[00:58:49] <freezevee> I am trying to getJSON a nested json and I can't find how to read nested data http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=Athens,gr&units=metric&cnt=1&appid=bd82977b86bf27fb59a04b61b657fb6f
[00:58:56] <freezevee> can anyone help ?
[00:59:15] <freezevee> for example data.list.temp.day
[00:59:38] <freezevee> list is an array so I tried data.list[0].temp.day but it doesn't work
[01:01:43] <coldhead> freezevee: it often helps to add a "debugger" statement to your code inside the function that processes the getJSON request. then you'll have access to data inside your console and you can try it out experimentally, so first try data.list, then data.list[0].temp or whatever
[01:02:06] <freezevee> coldhead: I did it but it still returns either undefined or an error in firebug
[01:02:23] <coldhead> even if you just try inspecting 'data'?
[01:02:44] <coldhead> if data itself is undefined then it's not a problem with nested JSON, i think
[01:02:49] <freezevee> I see the object but can't find how to read list
[01:02:50] <freezevee> https://gist.github.com/chrisvel/2d1b818b261e1d7bbda7
[01:02:54] <Uhkis> freezevee: data.list[0].temp.day works fine, are you sure it actually is json?
[01:03:04] <freezevee> hmmm no
[01:03:10] <freezevee> that's a good question
[01:03:19] <freezevee> it "looks like" json
[01:03:33] <Uhkis> freezevee: http://jsfiddle.net/oxne1qhk/
[01:05:00] <coldhead> http://jsonlint.com/ is happy with it
[01:05:10] <freezevee> so the problem is in my getJSON function
[01:06:02] <coldhead> i think the problem is what you originally said, how to access the nested data, and i still say it helps to drop into the debugger and try the code out one piece at a time
[01:07:40] <coldhead> freezevee: http://jsfiddle.net/oxne1qhk/1/
[01:08:03] <coldhead> i added comments to show you the successive things i typed once paused in the debugger to find a particular value
[01:08:08] <freezevee> .ajax and .get work
[01:08:16] <freezevee> only getJSON has the issue
[01:08:29] <freezevee> I guess it's something with the iteration
[01:08:57] <coldhead> no getJSON works pretty happily here too: http://jsfiddle.net/oxne1qhk/2/
[01:33:01] <coldhead> bye forever, freezevee

[03:34:48] <zizzl> Hey all, looking for recommendations here: I have a menu (<ul>) that I want to make responsive. So when in a smaller screen, I'd like to have a label "Filter" on the menu and it expands to show the menu items
[03:53:19] <iiwiiwiii> if i use `$.ajax` and get an empty response with the statuscode 201 i want to rerequest the url set in the "Location" header. The problem is that jquery tries to parse the response body which is empty and fails. What's the best way to workaround that? Currently i'm hijacking the error handler and check if the status is 201 and rerequest there.

[05:42:24] <momomo> is there a way to way for a style to be completely loaded and rendered before some javascript can be executed ?
[05:56:34] <momomo> is there a way a good way to wait for the height to be correct? right now setTimeout is required becasue of some wierd shit
[06:01:00] <Uhkis> $(document).ready() should be enough
[06:03:37] <momomo> Uhkis, no, it still gives me the incorrect height
[06:04:04] <Uhkis> ?demo @ momomo
[06:04:04] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:06:05] <momomo> it's going to be pretty hard
[06:06:15] <momomo> $(window).load( .. ) seems to fire a bit later
[06:06:20] <momomo> but not enough
[06:06:43] <momomo> is is there another one perhaps ?
[06:10:19] <momomo> it seems to only occur in chrome, not ff
[06:12:50] <arc_> place stylesheets above any scripts in your html file
[06:13:24] <momomo> yes, done .. i've even made sure that its loaded using js and tried onload

[07:06:50] <|RicharD|> guys how I can pick a element by a selector that is name=post[body] ?
[07:07:22] <|RicharD|> I've tried with $("form name[post[body]]") but say syntax error
[07:08:46] <shoky_> $("form input[name="post\\[body\\]"])
[07:24:44] <Cork> |RicharD|, shoky_: $('form input[name="post[body]"]')
[07:24:58] <Cork> no need for the \ escape if you quote the attribute value
[07:25:08] <|RicharD|> ehm
[07:25:11] <|RicharD|> I've tried with:
[07:25:14] <shoky_> o right
[07:25:21] <|RicharD|> $("form#new_post [name='post[body]']")
[07:25:30] <|RicharD|> but give me: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[07:25:30] <Cork> |RicharD|: that should work
[07:27:03] <Cork> |RicharD|: http://jsfiddle.net/5ors9bkb/
[07:29:38] <|RicharD|> k
[07:29:43] <|RicharD|> maybe I've problems in other places
[07:29:46] <|RicharD|> now I look in it
[07:41:20] <|RicharD|> Cork: ok fixed
[07:41:36] <|RicharD|> Cork: there was a problem in another part of my app - sorry!
[07:44:25] <kirua>  is it possible to import a css stylesheet file and use jquery to scoop it to one class or one div only ?
[07:48:27] <Cork> kirua: no
[07:48:48] <Cork> html has scipe for <style> tags, but not all browsers support it
[07:48:52] <Cork> uh...
[07:48:55] <Cork> *scope
[07:49:19] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style#A_scoped_stylesheet
[07:49:44] <Cork> scratch that, most doesn't support it
[07:50:17] <kirua> yeah thats why i cant use it
[07:50:24] <kirua> its not supported by chrome
[09:53:39] <odigem> how to navigate Jssor slider with arrows/bullets with my transition?
[10:14:18] <codecutter> is there an alternative to hasClass? it seem to be failing on dynamic content
[10:14:32] <codecutter> always returning false
[10:15:00] <Cork> codecutter: hasClass works on the set of element you selected
[10:15:03] <codecutter> i can see the class is there in dom
[10:15:17] <Cork> is the element in the selection?
[10:15:28] <Cork> var selection = $('selector')
[10:15:38] <codecutter> yes.
[10:15:41] <codecutter> let me get a pastebin
[10:15:43] <codecutter> 1 se
[10:15:44] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[10:15:46] <codecutter> sec*
[10:15:52] <Cork> not a pastebin
[10:16:38] <codecutter> nvm
[10:17:08] <codecutter> is there an alternative?
[10:17:15] <Cork> why would there be?
[10:17:30] <codecutter> how about attr?
[10:17:38] <Cork> attr is for reading html attributes
[10:17:42] <Cork> not checking states of the dom
[10:18:14] <Cork> hasClass works just fine you just have to find what else is breaking
[10:39:54] <lvegerano> Hello anyone here familiar with At.js? I would like to remove the click functionality after and element is inserted but I don't see how can this be done in the docs
[10:42:29] <kfrz> So I have a group of panels, I need to be able to select by some text in the heading of one of them
[10:42:49] <kfrz> how would i do this if there are many many panels??
[10:43:06] <kfrz> All I have passed in is the text I need to match
[10:43:17] <kfrz> but there could be many with the same, I need the first
[10:57:21] <taplar> kfrz: you could match with a custom find() and then get the first one
[10:58:11] <taplar> actually a custom filter would probably be better
[11:28:30] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to convert a serialized string from jquery ui sortable into a json object?
[11:37:16] <taplar> Es0teric: you already have the string?
[11:37:23] <Es0teric> taplar yep
[11:37:47] <taplar> you can parse it with JSON.parse, or if you have to support older IE versions then $.parseJson()
[11:46:27] <Es0teric> taplar_afk
[11:51:00] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to convert a serialized string from jquery ui sortable into a json object?
[11:51:38] <Kartagis> is it possible to use something like function onSuccess(res+var) ? var is a variable
[11:52:09] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis use toArray() instead.
[11:53:03] <Kartagis> duch_kazatel: can you give me an example?
[11:53:09] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-toArray
[11:53:16] <duch_kazatel> var sortedIDs = $( ".selector" ).sortable( "toArray" );
[11:53:56] <Kartagis> oh, is it possible that you replied to Es0teric but highlighted me?
[11:54:07] <duch_kazatel> errr, yep.
[11:54:08] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[11:54:12] <Kartagis> np
[11:54:21] <duch_kazatel> but your question - what do you mean onSuccess?
[11:54:35] <duch_kazatel> like, you want to pass your own var to a success handler?
[11:54:50] <duch_kazatel> because that's a little wonky.
[11:54:56] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ah i see
[11:55:30] <Kartagis> duch_kazatel: yes, but it has to be multiple. so instead of 10~ success callbacks, I do in one
[11:55:48] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis huh?  can you provide an example?
[11:57:05] <Kartagis> I've been developing this phonegap app, and I'm supposed to select 10~ images from the library
[11:57:10] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel that toArray can work but it doesnt quite give me the position number
[11:57:32] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric the index of each thing is the number.
[11:57:42] <Kartagis> so, instead of doing 10 times work, I thought I could do in one callback
[11:57:54] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis are you working with ajax?
[11:58:06] <Kartagis> aye
[11:58:10] <duch_kazatel> use promises :)
[11:58:22] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel http://pastebin.com/F8WMuG7Y
[11:58:23] <Kartagis> I don't make promises
[11:58:26] <Kartagis> jk
[11:58:39] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric make a fiddle.
[11:58:46] <Es0teric> the logic is there
[11:58:49] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:58:57] <duch_kazatel> i really hate it when people share pastes of code - where are you lost?
[11:59:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well that right there appends a new li in a ul
[11:59:18] <duch_kazatel> the index of each thing in the array returned by toArray is the index of it in the sortable.
[11:59:37] <Kartagis> I'm just so close to finishing this app, so switching to promises is a no no for me atm
[11:59:46] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel not true
[11:59:48] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis uh..
[11:59:57] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis except that fixes your problem.
[12:00:00] <duch_kazatel> super easy way to handle it.
[12:00:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric oh okay.  well that's what the docs say.
[12:00:16] <duch_kazatel> so without building it out in a fiddle i dunno what to tell you.
[12:01:24] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis all you really need is https://bpaste.net/show/8fbb6a555ae9
[12:01:56] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i see
[12:01:57] <Es0teric> ok
[12:02:05] <Es0teric> well i will try a couple things then put it in a fiddle
[12:19:31] <DarkSector> Hey guys, I am looking for a jquery plugin that allows me to draw various shapes using my mouse (polygons or predefined shapes as well as insert images) like drag and drop etc? Does anyone have any suggestions?
[12:20:03] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you'll find anything jquery based without including some kind of SVG lib on top of that.
[12:20:40] <DarkSector> I am looking for anything to get started really
[12:20:49] <DarkSector> Any suggestions are welcome
[12:21:40] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes
[12:22:18] <duch_kazatel> http://paperjs.org/examples/
[12:22:34] <duch_kazatel> probably lots of other choices.
[12:27:17] <noahmg123> does anyome know any good jQuery plugins that can create a search for a json file (with relevant filters)?
[12:27:58] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 jquery ui has autocomplete, there's also typeahead.
[12:28:29] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: OK. Just fyi I mean through not for. oops.
[12:28:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> oh, i understood what you meant.
[12:29:54] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: hmmm. OK. Well here's the deal. I have a set of images with metadata attached (name of photo, name of photographer, id #, name of state). So I would like a search area where they type in any combination of these filters (besides id #) and use a select menu on the state.
[12:30:19] <noahmg123> And they can select the images.
[12:30:33] <noahmg123> multi-select
[12:30:37] <duch_kazatel> yep.  jquery ui autocomplete or typeahead.js
[12:30:52] <duch_kazatel> there are others out there, just can't remember the names right now.
[12:31:31] <Es0teric> how do i get the index of an array?
[12:31:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric i think you mean of an item in an array, right?
[12:31:50] <duch_kazatel> and it depends on what you're doing.
[12:31:52] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah
[12:31:55] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok. I will take a look. I already have it written in php, js and ajax, but json will be easier if I need to edit it in the future.
[12:32:54] <Es0teric> so duch_kazatel how would i get the index of an item in an array?
[12:33:00] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that depends.
[12:33:12] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I am looking actually for something like this (http://rvera.github.io/image-picker/) with filters. Can typeahead do that?
[12:33:27] <duch_kazatel> what are you doing?  are you using forEach() on it?  are you in a for loop?  Or do you have a string and want to look up what index it is in the array?
[12:33:53] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 "with filters" meaning...?
[12:34:37] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 do you have an example of what you're trying to build?
[12:34:49] <duch_kazatel> because i wonder if you'll be able to find anything out of the box that fits the bill.
[12:35:41] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: OK. What I meant by filters was search boxes (for each of the metadatas I listed)
[12:36:04] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 wait back waaaay up - so you want a different box for each datapoint?
[12:36:22] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yes. Sorry for the confusion.
[12:36:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you're not really going to find anything out of the box as far as i know.
[12:36:49] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to build that custom
[12:37:25] <taplar> i keep thinking some sort of application of $.grep
[12:37:30] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok. Thx, anyway. I may just use a pagnation pluigin and my php solution for now.
[12:38:05] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 what you COULD do is build out all of those inputs and, on click or whatever, collect all those values and hand them over to your server.
[12:38:09] <duch_kazatel> and let that handle everything els.
[12:38:10] <duch_kazatel> *else.
[12:39:00] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you're sending a whole lot of data to the frontend that doesn't need to be there.
[12:39:04] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: that is what I have now with php, except it does not use json. I wanted json mainly so it would be simpler to handle.
[12:39:12] <duch_kazatel> eeeh.
[12:39:23] <duch_kazatel> as that data grows, it'll get way slow though.
[12:39:39] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yeah. but what else could I do?
[12:39:43] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those few cases where i'll point out that performance will very quickly become an issue.
[12:39:53] <duch_kazatel> send the query to your backend and have it go from there.
[12:39:58] <duch_kazatel> instead of filtering through JSON client-side.
[12:42:11] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: OK, here is what is happening. I have on input and on change handlers on my current search elements which runs an ajax to a php script that runs a function to grab the photos and uses a foreach to filter it.
[12:42:26] <duch_kazatel> there's your first problem then.
[12:42:33] <duch_kazatel> your php shouldn't send all that extra data back.
[12:42:44] <duch_kazatel> your php should be sending back just the data you need.
[12:42:48] <duch_kazatel> also: don'
[12:43:00] <duch_kazatel> *don't use forEach() to filter something when you have .filter() available :)
[12:43:20] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: the php has the foreach, so it is only sending back what is needed.
[12:43:31] <duch_kazatel> that's good then - that's what you want.
[12:44:29] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yeah, it's still a bit slow, but I think there may be a better solution which I may do in the future.
[12:44:44] <duch_kazatel> optimize youyr backend queries then.
[12:44:54] <duch_kazatel> but don't send all that data to the frontend - that'll get slow real quick.
[12:45:08] <duch_kazatel> i'd make sure your DB queries are snappy and optimize your php.
[12:46:17] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yeah. I think the best solution would be to send the query with the filters instead of grabing everything using foreach to filter it out. Do you think that will make much of a difference?
[12:46:47] <taplar> i do
[12:47:00] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 let's frame it this way: DBs are good at storing and retrieving data, right?
[12:47:07] <lvegerano> Hello anyone here familiar with At.js? I would like to remove the click functionality after and element is inserted but I don't see how can this be done in the docs
[12:47:17] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yes.
[12:47:36] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 so it would stand to reason then that your db is where you ask for relevant data, instead of the PHP, right?
[12:48:20] <duch_kazatel> lvegerano looks like it doesn't support that maybe?  seems like a very basic lib.
[12:49:22] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: yeah, I am actually using a premade php unction to grab the photos and not a raw DB call (because they are actually "technically" wordpress posts). It just get's messy when there are multiple filters involved an when a user only uses one or two of them.
[12:49:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah, don't use PHP for that part.
[12:50:09] <lvegerano> duch_kazatel: yeah I was wondering if anyone new of a workaround :)
[12:50:35] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok.
[13:00:51] <Es0teric> how do i chain dynamically adding new html elements in a ul ?
[13:01:20] <taplar> Es0teric: it's better to append an array at the end
[13:01:30] <Es0teric> taplar what do you mean?
[13:02:10] <taplar> var lis = []; lis.push(newli1);  lis.push(newli2); ....; ulvariable.append(lis)
[13:02:53] <Es0teric> taplar but.. how would that work though?
[13:03:21] <Es0teric> taplar also what if i want to push inside of the li and not outside of it?
[13:03:41] <taplar> you can manipulate the created element however you want
[13:05:10] <Es0teric> taplar ah i see ok
[13:05:19] <Es0teric> and then when i want to append all of them to a certain element i just do appendTo() ?
[13:05:47] <taplar> $parent.append(children) or $children.appendTo($parent)
[13:06:40] <taplar> the main point with this is to limit the number of times you change the dom
[13:06:54] <taplar> jquery will create a fragment for you for your elements so only one change happens
[13:12:07] <taplar> you could also use map if you don't want to keep track of the array yourself
[13:21:19] <codecutter> Cork: if i uncomment lines 5 & 6 then no nothing function (line 10) has effect, when comment it only the else block is true. If I remove the function on line 1 altogether than its fine. What could be the cause of this? (unable to reproduce problem in jsfiddle). http://pastebin.com/3JfpAskn
[13:22:09] <codecutter> this.select is a flight framework selector e.g. translate to $(..) in jq
[13:24:30] <codecutter> let me try that again! if i uncomment lines 5 & 6, function on 10 has no effect, if removed then only the else block on function line 10 is true. If the whole function on line 1 is removed altogether than its fine. What could be the cause of this? (unable to reproduce problem in jsfiddle). http://pastebin.com/3JfpAskn
[13:24:45] <taplar> so your saying this.select('showAllCompanies') == $('showAllCompanies')
[13:25:07] <taplar> ?
[13:25:27] <codecutter> tapler: this.select('showAllCompanies') = $('.foo');
[13:25:40] <taplar> k
[13:27:03] <taplar> dunno, you could console the selector and make sure it's matching what you think it should be
[13:27:13] <codecutter> it is.
[13:27:23] <codecutter> been at it all day.
[13:27:51] <taplar> and if you console log the outerHTML what do you see?
[13:28:05] <codecutter> hang on.
[13:28:44] <duch_kazatel> codecutter so let's reframe this: you've given us a paste of code but cannot give us a reproducable version of it.  we have no markup to look at, as well.  using this, we're supposed to magically understand what may or may not be happening based on your description?
[13:28:47] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:29:54] <duch_kazatel> you know that something about your code doesn't work, but you're not sure what/why/how/etc.  so there's a misunderstanding somewhere - so describing the problem to us seems a little... unusual.
[13:31:51] <taplar> also, side point, i'm not sure that is a legitamate use of toggleClass
[13:32:04] <codecutter> console.log($companyTable.outerHTML); is undefined
[13:32:28] <taplar> prop('outerHTML')
[13:34:23] <codecutter> tapler: 'show-all' class is not there.
[13:34:26] <codecutter> hmm
[13:34:58] <codecutter> well, that explains why else block is always true.
[13:36:28] <taplar> huh, nvm on that toggleClass comment
[13:36:53] <codecutter> i wasn't refering to that comment
[13:36:57] <taplar> ik
[13:37:10] <taplar> just me double checking myself, :)
[13:37:20] <duch_kazatel> he'd rather not wreck himself
[13:38:17] <codecutter> i think i am getting back the original node and no the updated node dynamacally replaced just before...
[13:42:24] <codecutter> tapler: That helped, atleast not i know i am apply the css to the wrong node. thanks
[13:42:31] <codecutter> now*
[13:42:43] <taplar> cool
[13:43:16] <taplar> well, not cool, but ya know
[13:46:53] <madsara> Hey -- someone look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/mc4uL119/1/ I'm losing an object when I call JSON.stringify()
[13:47:27] <codecutter> i know :)
[13:47:48] <madsara> Yeah?
[13:49:16] <madsara> Because they're functions?
[13:50:03] <duch_kazatel> madsara they were replying to somebody else.
[13:50:52] <taplar> madsara: but yeah, are lat and lng functions? it's looking like that
[13:50:58] <madsara> Ok
[13:51:13] <duch_kazatel> what do those constructors return?
[13:51:15] <madsara> So I can't stringify that
[13:51:50] <duch_kazatel> they don'
[13:52:01] <duch_kazatel> *yeah, those don't return simple objects.  they contain object references.
[13:52:48] <duch_kazatel> err, function references.
[13:52:49] <duch_kazatel> anyway
[13:58:46] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Is it possible to take that .slideToggle we worked on yesterday and make it slide from the top left instead of from the top? Or will I have to play with .animate for that?
[13:59:27] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ i'ma point out that i barely remember what i ate for breakfast (and i eat the same thing every day) so i have no idea what you're talking about ;)
[14:00:17] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel I'm the same way http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/6/
[14:00:33] <derekZero_> Except I think I skipped breakfast today :\
[14:00:49] <taplar> madsara: if you really want to -> https://jsfiddle.net/mc4uL119/3/
[14:01:15] <duch_kazatel> so derekZero_ did you read the docs for http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/ ?
[14:01:42] <duch_kazatel> because the first paragraph after all the method definitions is pretty clear.
[14:01:46] <duch_kazatel> "The .slideToggle() method animates the height of the matched elements."
[14:02:33] <derekZero_> I looked at it, but didn't see anything about changing the direction. thx
[14:02:49] <duch_kazatel> i just pasted the relevant line.
[14:02:53] <duch_kazatel> slidetoggle animates the height.
[14:02:54] <duch_kazatel> soooo :)
[14:03:19] <derekZero_> So I will need to change my approach to .animate, got it.
[14:07:09] <xniz> anyone have any problems with inaccurate window height in portrait view for mobile devices? i seem to be having an issue with a web page not properly determing the viewport size
[14:07:46] <xniz> http://goldbuyersva.com/xnizstudio/portfolio.html
[14:07:51] <kenelliott> hello, I'm working with ember and a rails api on localhost. and only in chrome i get a a long delay when doing requests. Using chrome devtools profiles it shows that it is in an idle state for 92% of the time. This only happens in chrome. My question is does anyone have any advice on how to debug this? OSX, EmberCLI, Rails w/ Foreman. I know it is kind of vague but I'm not sure how to debug it further.
[14:08:30] <kenelliott> http://cl.ly/image/3M0S1l1K2Y2g
[14:09:03] <xniz> when you click on one of the thumbnails on lets say an iPhone 6 in landscape view, the photo and container for the photo viewing plugin pops up properly, but it assumes that the toolbar is also displaying on the screen, thus cutting off the height making the div not fill the entire viewport
[14:09:07] <lordjancso> how should i load templates with javascript? for example i have a 2 panel layout. buttons on first panel, and if you press each button, on panel second will appear a content, which should come from an another file (i'm using nunjucks as templating engine)
[14:09:17] <kenelliott> added some console logs to jquery ajaxTransport.send and see it start the request - then after the delay the callback gets hit.
[14:09:39] <duch_kazatel> kenelliott you'll need to deep dive into each function call and see what's up.
[14:09:46] <duch_kazatel> kenelliott fwiw you
[14:09:55] <duch_kazatel> *you'll probably have more luck in ##javascript.
[14:10:31] <duch_kazatel> xniz are you able to make an isolated test case page?
[14:10:32] <kenelliott> thanks duch_kazatel not sure what function is deeper than ajaxTransport.send - that seems like where the buck stops in regards to the ajax request.
[14:10:51] <duch_kazatel> kenelliott yeah, hit up ##javascript.
[14:10:55] <xniz> duch_kazatel, i was just trying to figure out how i can go about showing you exactly what is happening...
[14:11:28] <duch_kazatel> xniz sometimes breaking it out into a standalone case will help you figure it out.
[14:11:29] <xniz> maybe a screenshot from my phone?? the photo-viewer works fine in landscape view, and on desktop browsers, oddly, its setting the wrong height in landscape view on mobile devices
[14:11:45] <duch_kazatel> xniz i can't debug a screenshot :)
[14:11:59] <xniz> duch_kazatel, well no, but maybe so you can see the problem. i dont think its code related..
[14:12:04] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:12:21] <xniz> maybe something in the browser.. its iffy... do you have an iPhone?
[14:12:24] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:12:27] <xniz> well
[14:12:37] <duch_kazatel> but you should handle cases like that ;)
[14:12:44] <duch_kazatel> can you replicate using chrome's emulator?
[14:13:37] <xniz> essentially, when you start scrolling on Safari on an iphone, the footer toolbar appears, and oddly, the missing pixels from the height of my photo viewer matches the toolbar height
[14:13:50] <xniz> its like, "the toolbar is currently visible" when its not.. if that makes sense
[14:13:53] <duch_kazatel> xniz so can you replicate using the chrome emulator?
[14:13:56] <xniz> let me try
[14:13:57] <xniz> one moment
[14:15:41] <xniz> duch_kazatel, works fine in the emulator.
[14:15:51] <xniz> no missing pixels from the background container in regards to height
[14:15:56] <duch_kazatel> okay, then it's a webkit quirk.
[14:16:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah, no idea in that case.  sorry!
[14:16:16] <duch_kazatel> i might look at something like ghostlabs to help you troubleshoot.
[14:17:55] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  im with you...i think its a safari issue.. :/
[14:18:28] <xniz> like i said, its cutting off the background container height to match the height of the footer toolbar. so again.. its taking away from the height because the toolbar is "visible" when it isnt..
[14:18:36] <duch_kazatel> i believe you.
[14:18:44] <duch_kazatel> but i'm not sure how you expect me to help :)
[14:18:53] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  i dont :P
[14:18:59] <xniz> gonna have to figure that out on my own hehe
[14:19:01] <duch_kazatel> ghostlab might be a good call here.
[14:19:06] <xniz> alright look into it
[14:21:14] <xniz> hehe.. when i flip my phone into landscape, the footer address bar position changes into a header address bar, and it works fine. stupid safari heh
[14:25:23] <xniz> duch_kazatel, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724 ...  the issue is not fixed. jQuery is reporting the height minus the bar. when the document scrolls and the bar disappears, the height is not recalculated. just if your interested in reading
[14:25:53] <duch_kazatel> closed as a "can't fix".
[14:25:54] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[14:26:31] <xniz> i know... seems like it could be an easy fix... i mean.. if the toolbar is not visible, then readjust the height.. lol
[14:26:52] <duch_kazatel> "If the discussion in the pull request above wasn't clear enough, we are unable to fix the issue with Safari. I will re-close this as cantfix to make that clear. You should try to convince Apple that this is a problem. "
[14:26:56] <duch_kazatel> not a jquery thing to solve.
[14:27:25] <xniz> duch_kazatel, i agree
[14:27:40] <duch_kazatel> also,  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/764 seems to suggest a fix.
[14:33:46] <xniz> duch_kazatel, thanks. ill read up on it. i knew it was browser related, but i seem to get positive feedback in here, so i typically come here when im dealing with javascript/jquery stuff
[14:34:10] <duch_kazatel> okay?
[14:36:55] <xniz> and..fixed.. :)
[14:37:31] <xniz> var winheight= window.innerHeight ? window.innerHeight:$(window).height() seemed to do the trick. cheers
[14:48:08] <codecutter> why is the second statement false and whats the correct syntax? http://pastebin.com/NT4GJYE1
[14:48:58] <codecutter> line 4 should be comTable (same variable)
[14:49:15] <duch_kazatel> use .eq() btw
[14:49:17] <duch_kazatel> not []
[14:49:43] <duch_kazatel> then you can do $comTable.eq(0)
[14:50:28] <duch_kazatel> try console.log($comTable.eq(0).prop('class'));
[14:50:31] <duch_kazatel> what does that give you?
[14:52:48] <codecutter> i get "comp-mentioned"
[14:52:56] <duch_kazatel> there you go then.
[14:52:58] <codecutter> no "show-all"
[14:53:17] <bed777> hi
[14:53:22] <codecutter> trying to check for "show-all"
[14:53:25] <duch_kazatel> codecutter no idea then.  can you make an example?
[14:53:36] <codecutter> strange, huh?
[14:53:56] <duch_kazatel> codecutter something about your code seems really unusual to me.
[14:54:08] <duch_kazatel> this.select('showAllCompanies'); is worrying.
[14:54:09] <codecutter> alas, i'm unable to reproduce it jsfiddle
[14:54:14] <bed777> http://dpaste.com/2R8CHZT
[14:54:15] <duch_kazatel> what is "this.select()"
[14:54:16] <bed777> any ideas?
[14:54:20] <codecutter> thats just a selector
[14:54:29] <codecutter> working with a framework here
[14:54:38] <duch_kazatel> er.
[14:54:43] <duch_kazatel> what does that framework return?
[14:54:49] <duch_kazatel> bed777 what plugin?
[14:54:51] <codecutter> this.select can be translated to $()
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> codecutter no it can't.
[14:55:23] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're using custom tags.
[14:55:25] <codecutter> this.select('foo') == $('.foo')
[14:55:32] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:56:03] <codecutter> foo in this.select('foo') is a variable, which in turn points to $('.foo');
[14:56:11] <bed777> jquer plugin 1.4.1
[14:56:18] <bed777> maybe the solution is just to upgrade the plugin
[14:56:26] <bed777> according to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18486165/remove-cookie-using-jquery-not-working
[14:56:40] <duch_kazatel> codecutter that seems way off.  are you sure you're returning the right thing?  i feel like that might be related.
[14:57:16] <codecutter> have a look this https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/v1.x/doc/base_api.md#this.attributes
[14:57:27] <duch_kazatel> back up.
[14:57:32] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery?
[14:57:36] <codecutter> yes
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> okay - so then what you want is to pair your example down to just that bit.
[14:58:22] <codecutter> let me get another pastebin just in jq
[14:58:24] <codecutter> 1 sec
[15:03:56] <codecutter> How about now? http://pastebin.com/Xpt9dLcE
[15:04:45] <codecutter> notice that '.show-all' is visible on line 11
[15:07:02] <duch_kazatel> dunno then mang.
[15:07:12] <duch_kazatel> that's how hasClass() works.
[15:08:17] <codecutter> strange behaviour, right?
[15:08:45] <codecutter> Cork: around?
[15:09:31] <duch_kazatel> codecutter did you try hasClass in your latest code?
[15:09:45] <codecutter> ofcourse!
[15:09:52] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, something isn't adding up.
[15:10:45] <Es0teric> how do i make this dynamically in jquery: http://pastebin.com/H5TJJMdV
[15:10:58] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric using strings.
[15:11:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel example?
[15:11:34] <duch_kazatel> $('<div>some text</div>');
[15:11:43] <codecutter> works fine if i remove the following function and its listener  http://pastebin.com/S6DrsDsr
[15:12:10] <duch_kazatel> codecutter do you have any console errors?
[15:12:17] <codecutter> no
[15:12:20] <duch_kazatel> have you tried using a step debugger?
[15:12:32] <duch_kazatel> something here seems WAY off.  that code should have no impact.
[15:12:34] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah but how do i split it into sections
[15:12:40] <Es0teric> and then combine everything?
[15:12:43] <codecutter> i dont have one set up
[15:12:44] <Es0teric> once its all right
[15:13:13] <duch_kazatel> duch_kazatel you really want a templating engine.
[15:13:33] <duch_kazatel> err, Es0teric
[15:14:02] <Uhkis> lol
[15:14:32] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel underscorejs has a templating engine right?
[15:14:35] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:17:35] <codecutter> hmm
[15:17:45] <codecutter> i think i see the problem
[15:17:53] <codecutter> thanks to debugger
[15:17:59] <duch_kazatel> and what's the issue?
[15:19:02] <codecutter> this function is being called every time i click on that element http://pastebin.com/S6DrsDsr
[15:19:12] <codecutter> the actual function is called after
[15:19:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:19:46] <duch_kazatel> way lost, but ok.
[15:20:41] <codecutter> yeah. sorry. I have alot of flight specific events in the background, which i did not paste
[15:21:04] <codecutter> but i think i see whats happening
[15:21:09] <codecutter> thx
[15:23:01] <arup_r> I have 3 events bound on the parent, and a child have one of them. But the child event listening those parent events also,it bubbles up. How can I stop it? I tried event.stopImmediatePropagation(); but it didn't worj
[15:23:04] <arup_r> work
[15:23:41] <duch_kazatel> arup_r could be all sorts of issues - make a fiddle ;)
[15:23:43] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:24:01] <arup_r> I wrote a Coffescript :)
[15:27:56] <mentoc> I just opened an index.html file to see this in the <script> section: {% for (var i=0, file; file=o.files[i]; i++) { %}   What is that?
[15:32:40] <codecutter> fixed
[15:33:14] <codecutter> had to place following inside the function e.stopPropagation();
[15:33:14] <codecutter>  e.preventDefault();
[15:33:27] <codecutter> not i need the last one
[15:33:32] <codecutter> not sure*
[15:34:11] <duch_kazatel> mentoc looks like some kind of templating setup.
[15:34:29] <mentoc> duch_kazatel: ah, k I'll look into that. thanks.
[15:34:51] <codecutter> thats all, folks!
[15:35:32] <duch_kazatel> arup_r let's make a deal.
[15:35:59] <duch_kazatel> if I can create a simplified fiddle of your problem without being 100% sure is going on, will you actually start trying to make test cases?
[15:36:15] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel I achieved my coveted diagonal motion, but is there a way to make it look like a more naturally moving triangle instead of a square that bounces into a triangle? http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/7/
[15:36:33] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ not sure what you mean.
[15:36:53] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you want to animate the left property instead.
[15:38:34] <duch_kazatel> arup_r so basically, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLtLgk7k/
[15:38:41] <duch_kazatel> you have the same handler bound to both elements, right?
[15:38:48] <duch_kazatel> and you want it to fire only once?
[15:39:17] <derekZero_> Correct
[15:39:28] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: Here is mine https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/59448f42364de7e1f227.  Not able to stop propagation for beforeSend and complete events using event.stopImmediatePropagation() ..
[15:39:30] <derekZero_> Oh, that guy.
[15:39:36] <duch_kazatel> arup_r no more coffeescript.
[15:39:38] <arup_r> sorry for coffescript
[15:39:43] <arup_r> ok.. deleting
[15:39:48] <duch_kazatel> please stop with the cfscript.  i can't read it, and this isn't a paired down example.
[15:40:00] <duch_kazatel> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLtLgk7k/ - does this illustrate the problem you're having?
[15:40:03] <arup_r> one min.. I will delete it
[15:42:02] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: yes same issue
[15:42:27] <duch_kazatel> arup_r notice how i'm providing just enough code to reproduce the problem?
[15:42:27] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[15:42:43] <arup_r> hum saw it
[15:42:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLtLgk7k/1/
[15:43:02] <duch_kazatel> this is one way to fix it.
[15:43:21] <jak2000> how to remove a , from a number by sample: wstrnum="1,239.00"  i need convert to "1239.00" how to
[15:43:32] <arup_r> I tried, but didn't work for me
[15:43:34] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 by using .replace()
[15:43:43] <jak2000> ok thanks
[15:43:52] <duch_kazatel> arup_r it works fine in the fiddle.  make sure you're passing the event object correctl.
[15:43:56] <duch_kazatel> *correctly
[15:45:19] <arup_r> I am passing event correctly. I tried http://makandracards.com/makandra/1122-cancelling-event-propagation-with-jquery everything except false from here
[15:45:27] <m2n> I have some html structure as <h1><a href="someurl">abc</a> Some text</h1> , can anyone plz temme how can I replace "Some text" using jquery ? $('h1').text('new text') will remove a tag
[15:45:35] <duch_kazatel> araujo i don't see your code.
[15:45:45] <duch_kazatel> err arup_r
[15:46:00] <duch_kazatel> m2n you need to use .contents() to select the specific text node.
[15:46:01] <arup_r> ok
[15:47:31] <m2n> duch_kazatel, thanks for the pointer.. I will look into it...:)
[15:47:52] <arup_r> my JS code http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/NGXXgG
[15:48:10] <duch_kazatel> (wat)
[15:48:30] <duch_kazatel> lol what does this have to do with the stuff from earlier?
[15:48:35] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[15:49:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to check the docs for rails.
[15:49:38] <arup_r> haha
[15:49:42] <arup_r> I did.
[15:49:43] <duch_kazatel> because that's not a native event.
[15:49:50] <duch_kazatel> so rails defines the callback signature
[15:50:12] <duch_kazatel> fwiw the signature can't change from function(event, xhr, settings) to function(xhr, settings)
[15:50:19] <arup_r> that is simple. The concept here is it is bubbling.. rails is not responsible.. it is me and my Jquery understanding
[15:50:33] <duch_kazatel> except rails modified the way .on() works.
[15:50:39] <arup_r> yes, Rails does callback
[15:50:39] <duch_kazatel> so it isn't that simple.
[15:50:45] <duch_kazatel> right, raisl modified how .on() works.
[15:50:54] <duch_kazatel> so your code is no longer really using jquery.
[15:51:55] <duch_kazatel> .on() dopesn't send "xhr" or "settings" to the callback.  it sends an event object and then extraParameters.  there's a chance your xhr object is actually the event object.
[15:52:04] <duch_kazatel> but that's not jquery.
[15:54:00] <arup_r> No. see the table: https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/ajax#custom-events-fired-during-data-remote-requests
[15:54:19] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:54:24] <arup_r> It is pretty simple. But some where I increased the compleity
[15:54:30] <duch_kazatel> oh okay.
[15:54:32] <duch_kazatel> then good luck.
[15:54:35] <arup_r> event as a param are always added
[15:54:36] <duch_kazatel> fwiw your answer is inside that page.
[15:54:40] <duch_kazatel> but whatevs duder.
[15:54:44] <arup_r> nah. they didn't say
[15:54:49] <duch_kazatel> actually they do.
[15:55:09] <duch_kazatel> parameters after event*
[15:55:28] <duch_kazatel> what does that first asterisk say? * All handlers bound to jQuery events are always passed the event object as the first argument. Extra parameters denotes the parameters passed after the event argument. E.g. if the Extra parameters are listed as [xhr, settings], then to access them, you would define your handler with function(event, xhr, settings){}. See this article for a more in-depth
[15:55:28] <duch_kazatel> explanation.
[15:55:36] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your first event handler is wrong.
[15:57:10] <placidb> I'm using a negative css margin-top on an inner element, with an overflow: hidden on an outer element to provide some 'push out' toggle interaction using css3 transitions. I calculate the inner element's margin-top position on document ready. but this results in the inner element being slid out of view. what can I do to prevent the animation to occur on page load? I've tried chaining two .css()
[15:57:11] <placidb> calls and also separating the calls, but no luck. any opinions?
[15:57:52] <duch_kazatel> placidb can you... make a fiddle ;)
[16:02:52] <placidb> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/g1g539t5/
[16:03:56] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue?  rereading your description, is sounds like you don't want this to happen on pageload, right?
[16:04:03] <placidb> exactly
[16:04:09] <duch_kazatel> then delete the code...?
[16:04:13] <placidb> ??
[16:04:25] <placidb> I don't want the inner element to be visible after the page has loaded
[16:04:26] <duch_kazatel> "i have code that's doing something.  i don't want it to do it"
[16:04:39] <placidb> so I try hiding it upon page load, but it results in an unwanted animation
[16:05:00] <duch_kazatel> ah, that's because you're using .css() to set a transition.
[16:05:10] <placidb> I'm looking for a way to set margin-top, without triggering the transition
[16:05:30] <duch_kazatel> basically, you can't.
[16:06:01] <duch_kazatel> somebody else might have an idea, though.
[16:06:13] <placidb> I think I understand
[16:06:42] <placidb> but I wonder what margin-top value is being used as the 'base value' for the transition
[16:06:51] <placidb> if you set the transition after the margin-top was set
[16:06:55] <placidb> shouldn't that become the new base?
[16:07:01] <placidb> or is it always 0?
[16:07:20] <placidb> perhaps this question belongs in #css ..
[16:08:09] <cuppy> Not exactly sure how to ask my question ... $(document).ready() fires when things settle down, but it appears that I have some reactive things happening after that, possibly JS related. Is there a listener I can use for when all JS settles as well?
[16:08:33] <duch_kazatel> cuppy sounds like you're tackling window load vs document ready.
[16:08:51] <duch_kazatel> you can't guarantee it, but you can try $(window).load() and see if that's any close.
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> *closer
[16:08:57] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/8/ This works on fiddle, but without width: 0; Chrome will lose the integrity of the triangle on toggle and become a polygon. Is there a browser fix for that?
[16:09:12] <cuppy> duch_kazatel, thanks - I'll try it.
[16:09:14] <derekZero_> width: 0; being in the #menu CSS property
[16:09:23] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ i'm confused by your problem.
[16:09:31] * derekZero_ xD 
[16:09:35] <duch_kazatel> why can't you have width: 0;?
[16:10:28] <xniz> derekZero_,  cool effects :P
[16:10:34] <derekZero_> Without width: 0; in the #menu CSS property the bounce animation will extend so far to the right that it gains another corner.
[16:10:47] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ why is having width: 0; a problem?
[16:10:52] <derekZero_> xniz thx. I just wish it would behave like a good little effect.
[16:10:59] <chriscalip> hello trying to figure out the selector for <a href="#tester">Tester</a>
[16:11:35] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel I can go without it in fiddle and the triangle will stay. When I open the original file in my Chrome browser the triangle will extend until it gains another corner and becomes a polygon.
[16:11:46] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip do what now?
[16:12:00] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ when you omit the width: 0;?
[16:12:05] <derekZero_> Yes
[16:12:12] <duch_kazatel> so what happens if you leave it in?
[16:12:42] <derekZero_> If I leave it in the triangle will stay, but it will not bounce to the right right corner. It acts like a linear animation on the way out but will bounce back in.
[16:12:56] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel : I am trying to hook in to the event on click of the a tag with a href value of "#tester"
[16:13:10] <duch_kazatel> so you need a maximum width on it
[16:13:12] <chriscalip> trying to figure out the selector for that
[16:13:16] * derekZero_ :O 
[16:13:28] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip give the tag a class or something then.
[16:13:44] * derekZero_ think duch_kazatel has a point. 
[16:13:49] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel , I dont have access to the a tag generation..
[16:14:01] <duch_kazatel> yuck
[16:14:05] <duch_kazatel> you need an attribute selector.
[16:14:07] <duch_kazatel> but those are slow.
[16:14:17] <chriscalip> ill take it
[16:14:18] <duch_kazatel> so make sure you pair down to a section of the document first.
[16:14:45] * derekZero_ :\ 
[16:14:54] <chriscalip> its inside a <li> tag with a class="tester2"
[16:15:08] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Just tried it, and the triangle behaves the same whether width or max-width slaps it on the wrist :O
[16:15:22] <derekZero_> It defeats the bounce to the right... hmmm
[16:15:24] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip then target through that LI instead.
[16:16:38] <chriscalip> with that data, <li class="tester2"><a href="tester"></a></li> whats the selector?
[16:16:52] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip do you know how you'd select that with CSS?
[16:16:53] <xniz> .tester2 a?
[16:17:12] <duch_kazatel> (hey don't hand out the answer ;) )
[16:17:19] <xniz> sorry.. :P
[16:17:27] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: fixed it. want to see fixed Coffee code? :p
[16:17:28] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel i dont know .. but thanks for the guidance
[16:17:34] <duch_kazatel> arup_r nope.
[16:17:44] <arup_r> ok.
[16:17:48] <xniz> chriscalip, to select that hyperlink, it us .test2 a
[16:17:54] <xniz> err .tester2 a
[16:17:59] <xniz> that is how you would "grab" it so to speak
[16:18:09] <duch_kazatel> arup_r for future reference, you need to really use JS "snippets" in here, not coffeescript.
[16:18:20] <arup_r> ok
[16:18:25] <arup_r> I will remember
[16:18:31] * derekZero_ has shapes in his shapes 
[16:18:41] <xniz> derekZero_, lol :P
[16:18:47] <duch_kazatel> i know that tomorrow you're going to come here tomorrow and ignore that, but it's worth mentioning arup_r ;)
[16:19:04] <chriscalip> xniz how to do add additional with filter . only a href="tester" ..
[16:19:21] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip use an attribute selector or .filter()
[16:19:27] <derekZero_> One day I will perfect these silly animations, and I'll give you guys the url so you can celebrate it's success over breakfast cereal.
[16:19:29] <chriscalip> err i mean a href="#tester"
[16:19:36] <arup_r> I am so tired, that I am lazy here
[16:19:43] <xniz> derekZero_, will be waiting hehe.
[16:19:45] <chriscalip> ok ill google attribute selector..
[16:20:02] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip i'd opt for .filter() mostly because it'll be a bit quicker.
[16:20:39] <duch_kazatel> and easier to read imo
[16:21:00] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel got some access restrictions in play.. only have access to giving the jquery selector.
[16:21:09] <chriscalip> using an api
[16:21:10] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip huh?
[16:21:13] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:21:15] <xniz> sheesh i should have finished my graphic design course.. >.<... i feel like what im working with is so plain ugh
[16:21:25] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip so you're not using jquery?
[16:21:27] * derekZero_ chews cereal loudly 
[16:21:38] <xniz> derekZero_, at least css can do some funky stuff
[16:21:57] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel I dont have access to doing $('.tester2 a')  I can only give the jquery selector to an api
[16:22:06] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:22:10] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty bad.
[16:22:17] <chriscalip> yup
[16:22:22] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[16:22:23] * xniz watches...
[16:23:19] <xniz> derekZero_, got any other funky animations you've done?
[16:23:26] <xniz> def some cool stuff
[16:24:01] <cuppy> handlebars.js stuff is messing with my $(document).ready() functions. It doesn't matter where I put it - at the top, very bottom, whatever - handlebars is still running after. Any ideas? Did try $(window).load().
[16:24:23] <duch_kazatel> cuppy what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:24:24] <derekZero_> xniz Thx. No, right now I'm hashing out some stuff I've been learning so I can rework my portfolio.
[16:25:15] <derekZero_> My first draft had some animations, but not as exciting as this. Slide and fadeIn. Looked like a PowerPoint.
[16:25:26] <xniz> derekZero_, awesome.. im working on getting my portfolio up as well. im more of a coder than designer though so my website is a bit plain. i am a bit experienced in photoshop and illustrator, but i am horrible at drawing on paper so :/
[16:25:35] <xniz> derekZero_, yeah that one is way cool
[16:26:03] <xniz> derekZero_, http://goldbuyersva.com/xnizstudio/portfolio.html is some of my work
[16:26:23] <cuppy> duch_kazatel, I'm just trying to change some text if it is a certain string. if ( $('#mydiv').text() === 'foo' ) { $('#mydiv').text('bar') };
[16:26:42] <duch_kazatel> cuppy why not do that via handlebars then?
[16:26:42] <placidb> duch_kazatel: fyi, I found the solution. now using an !important rule which turns off any transitioning that I remove on page load.
[16:27:07] <xniz> derekZero_, any channels on here for general topics?
[16:27:21] <duch_kazatel> #web
[16:27:31] <xniz> cool
[16:27:42] <derekZero_> xniz Looks nice. Thought about auto loading on scroll instead of the Show More button?
[16:28:31] <derekZero_> xniz Sometimes I hit up #programming and #web. I've been on jQuery a lot lately just because that's the newest thing I've been reading on. I guess I spend more time in whatever room is relevant to what I'm reading.
[16:28:44] <xniz> derekZero_, actually.. no i hadnt lol. but thanks for the idea, i may give it a go
[16:29:23] <duch_kazatel> xniz why have a "load more" at all on there?
[16:29:48] <xniz> duch_kazatel, good question...
[16:30:08] <derekZero_> xniz I like that you have pricing mentioned on there. I've seen most portfolios leave that a mystery.
[16:30:10] <duch_kazatel> also: compress your images and use smaller ones for the thumbnails.
[16:30:13] <xniz> i was thinking of the page loading quicker with less thumbnails, but i guess it doesnt matter because the images are fetched anyways... not like im appending it
[16:30:37] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel Idk, I like his large thumbnails just because they're nice pics.
[16:30:48] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i meant ;)
[16:30:53] <derekZero_> ah, sorry
[16:31:10] <xniz> well.. i went with the large thumbnails for two reasons... 1) i didnt want to compress 20+ images lol, and 2) i like how the thumbnails zoom in and center on the origin
[16:31:13] <plamb> is it possible to link to a page and when that page loads its scrolled to the bottom (or to an anchor)
[16:31:25] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating what i said,.
[16:31:36] <duch_kazatel> you're loading full size images into those thumbnail spots.
[16:31:37] <xniz> im sorry?
[16:31:46] <duch_kazatel> so the user has to download the entire full res image.
[16:32:03] <duch_kazatel> even if they never click it.
[16:32:06] <xniz> duch_kazatel, Yes... I understand.
[16:32:14] <duch_kazatel> so compress 'em down and reduce the size on them :)
[16:32:23] <duch_kazatel> plamb do you control the other page?
[16:32:29] <plamb> yes
[16:32:39] <duch_kazatel> then sure - give that element an ID and use a hash in the url.
[16:32:40] <derekZero_> xniz You provide code and graphics for your clients?
[16:32:42] <xniz> duch_kazatel, compress them as in resize them?
[16:32:52] <plamb> all you have to do is provide the hash in the url eh
[16:32:54] <xniz> derekZero_, yes. but just simple graphics. nothing too fancy
[16:32:57] <duch_kazatel> xniz and compress them as in reduce their filesize.
[16:33:05] <derekZero_> Neato
[16:33:13] <duch_kazatel> http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php is your friend.
[16:33:58] <xniz> duch_kazatel, but if i compress them, then I will have to have two separate images? one for the thumbnail view, and one for the actual photo viewer?
[16:34:15] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:34:32] <xniz> derekZero_, i do alot of things, but i am best with photo manipulation and i've got a small photography studio in the back of my store to photograph small objects
[16:34:40] <xniz> duch_kazatel, yeah.. i wanted to avoid that lol :(
[16:34:48] <xniz> so much work... but it makes sense.. saves bandwidth for mobile viewers
[16:34:50] <duch_kazatel> xniz so you want to punish your mobile users? ;)
[16:34:51] <derekZero_> Neat
[16:34:52] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[16:35:00] <xniz> duch_kazatel, :(..
[16:35:08] <duch_kazatel> programming is hard ;)
[16:35:10] * derekZero_ sinks in his chair 
[16:35:17] * xniz smacks forehead
[16:35:25] <plamb> duch_kazatel:  is it url/#hashtoanchor or url#hashtoanchor
[16:35:31] <duch_kazatel> plamb either one.
[16:35:36] <plamb> o-oh
[16:35:43] <blitz-_> If i click a table row with id=blabla, how do i select the third cell with on('click')?
[16:35:54] <xniz> duch_kazatel, well... maybe ill open photoshop and get to it :P
[16:36:04] <duch_kazatel> or use imagemagick...
[16:36:09] <duch_kazatel> it can automate all of that for you.
[16:36:13] <xniz> oh?
[16:36:17] <xniz> a collection of images?
[16:36:30] <duch_kazatel> yep.  batches that kind of stuff like a champ.
[16:36:57] <xniz> gotcha.. i bet i could find some extensions for photoshop to do that as well.. or it probably already has that feature.. just hadnt found it heh
[16:37:04] * xniz googles..
[16:37:17] <xniz> im on my company computer and dont really want to install anymore software. :/
[16:37:27] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[16:37:28] <duch_kazatel> it's a tool.
[16:37:34] <duch_kazatel> reduces the work you have to do.
[16:38:21] <xniz> I'll give it a go and see what happens :) if anything ill just uninstall it later or hide it from the desktop.. my boss wont know any better heh
[16:38:23] <duch_kazatel> also i'm kind of surprised you give pricing like that.
[16:38:31] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[16:38:48] <xniz> duch_kazatel, im just starting out. and it also says, prices are subject to change :P
[16:39:14] <duch_kazatel> great, so now you've got a client who bought the thousand dollar package and suddenly changes scope ;)
[16:39:23] <xniz> changes scope how so?
[16:39:31] <xniz> wants more work?
[16:39:52] <duch_kazatel> "hey so we didn't actually want the site you made - we have this whole other vision.  you'll do that for the same price, right?"
[16:40:15] <xniz> If im already paid for the first one, sure... ill keep taking their money
[16:40:27] <duch_kazatel> but they won't want to pay you for the first one.
[16:40:31] <duch_kazatel> becuase they "didn't use it" ;)
[16:40:43] <xniz> well, thats just something that i will have to outline in my "guidelines"
[16:40:46] <duch_kazatel> they were advertised to for 8 pages, but they wound up not using them.  see the issue?
[16:40:49] <duch_kazatel> no guidelines - contracts.
[16:40:53] <duch_kazatel> protect yourself and the client.
[16:40:56] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[16:40:57] <xniz> duch_kazatel, gotcha
[16:41:18] <xniz> thank you, sincerely for the advice. because i really am kind of lost on the business end of this
[16:41:50] <duch_kazatel> warning: NSFW language, but a fantastic talk about the subject - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U

[16:42:43] <xniz> duch_kazatel, another thing is that, I am requiring security deposits as well. whatever the percentage may be
[16:42:49] <xniz> but again, in the end, the contract is what matters
[16:42:53] <duch_kazatel> 100%
[16:43:03] <duch_kazatel> you can also charge by the hour.
[16:43:06] <duch_kazatel> that's a big one, too.
[16:43:16] <duch_kazatel> but you have to protect yourself and your craft.
[16:43:52] <xniz> hmm.. i had thought about that. but the thing is that, i might spend 2 hours tinkering with something and scrap it... then its like "well, i just worked 2 hours and have no result, but you still have to pay me"... and i dont want to be that guy... i mean.. i know i have to make money but idk... its touchy
[16:44:02] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:44:04] * derekZero_ likes the security deposit idea 
[16:44:14] <duch_kazatel> you still spent 2 hours researching and designing.
[16:44:17] <xniz> derekZero_, for sure.. either way, i get at least some moeny for my time
[16:44:17] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of your estimate.
[16:44:24] <duch_kazatel> which you multiply by three.
[16:44:34] <xniz> duch_kazatel, hmmm ... i see
[16:44:41] <derekZero_> duch still thinks they owe you more money :)
[16:44:47] <xniz> hehehe
[16:44:48] <duch_kazatel> like, you spent time working on it.
[16:44:51] <duch_kazatel> it's valid work.
[16:45:00] <duch_kazatel> rarely does somebody get it right on the first try.
[16:45:03] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: gonna watch that just because of the title, have no idea what's going on though
[16:45:04] <xniz> duch_kazatel, I agree. but consumers don't always realize that
[16:45:14] <duch_kazatel> xniz then you educate them.
[16:45:20] <duch_kazatel> they disagree?  you don't want them.
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> the customer who doesn't value your time and expertise isn't worth either.
[16:45:43] <derekZero_> xniz Maybe use infographics or videos in a Solutions tab or something?
[16:45:46] <duch_kazatel> you don't tell them what they're worth ;)
[16:45:50] <derekZero_> I might do that.
[16:46:07] <xniz> duch_kazatel, compelling :)
[16:46:14] <Kamuela> actually, from bits and pieces this convo looks awesome. i'm gonna read it
[16:46:25] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela that video is all about why you get a contract.
[16:46:33] <duch_kazatel> and how your lawyer makes you money.
[16:46:35] <duch_kazatel> stuff like that.
[16:46:39] <duch_kazatel> gotta protect the craft.
[16:46:47] <Kamuela> have you ever watched um
[16:46:50] <Kamuela> House of Lies?
[16:47:08] <xniz> indeed... well, I have went through a lot of differetn scenarios in my head, as to what could happen, but ulimately, the contract is what protects me, and the consumer
[16:47:15] <derekZero_> developers are some of the most valuable agents to a company. You generate most of their potential.
[16:47:24] <xniz> derekZero_, i agree..
[16:48:01] <duch_kazatel> xniz also, charging enough means that the rest of us keep making enough for our valuable niche skillset.
[16:48:17] <duch_kazatel> don't devalue yourself - when you do, you devalue the rest of us.
[16:48:37] <xniz> well my idea is meet with local businesses, who already have presence on the web, but whose websites are NOT mobile friendly... then go in and (if their logo design is trending and appropriate for their image as a business) ill keep the logo, and redesign/recode their website and make it mobile friendly.
[16:48:41] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: basically in House of Lies there was $20mil bonus that was owed to the main show's agency, and the guy just didn't pay. and it came down to you can't really do anything about it because litigation alone would make you lose since your budget is lower
[16:48:42] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  thank you :)
[16:49:19] <duch_kazatel> xniz that's awesome - great wheelhouse to have.  just don't inadvertently screw yourself in the process ;) don't show your cards too early.
[16:49:20] <Kamuela> in fact Alan Weiss talks about it in his book as well. He said contracts are important but basically you need to really trust your client because when it comes down to it, a contract cannot protect you once you've already "paid" and the client does not
[16:49:40] <xniz> over 70% of the local websites i've found for small business are absolutely horrible on mobile viewing platforms.. and if you think about it, most consumers browse from mobile operating systems, statistically speaking. and that rate is increasing annually
[16:49:56] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela those are exceptional cases.  and that's why you build language into the contract that stipulates extra cash if you get jerked around.
[16:50:02] <xniz> duch_kazatel, I will take into consideration what you told me, for sure. and rework that pricing page
[16:50:14] <duch_kazatel> xniz don't have a pricing page is my entire point.
[16:50:31] <xniz> duch_kazatel, gotcha. what could i replace it with then... hehe
[16:50:40] <duch_kazatel> highlight the services you offer - don't show your hand too early.
[16:50:59] <xniz> duch_kazatel, well also, i forgot to mention is i do local tech work as well for local businesses
[16:51:00] <duch_kazatel> show what you've done, testimonials if you have them, and what sort of services you offer.
[16:51:08] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - you can provide estimates for those.
[16:51:11] <xniz> that is something i could actually price
[16:51:14] <xniz> exactly
[16:51:15] <duch_kazatel> eeeh.
[16:51:19] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't price that out either.
[16:51:25] <Kamuela> I charge by the week and ask for upfront
[16:51:26] <xniz> well Estimate rather
[16:51:40] <duch_kazatel> "estimates" as in "what you quote the client for the potential"
[16:51:52] <Kamuela> it's basically a weakness of mine that I do that, i never really know how to price myself so i just decide screw it, just compensate my time
[16:52:13] <Kamuela> but yes the best thing to do would be to price by value
[16:52:16] <Kamuela> value-added
[16:52:16] <derekZero_> http://jsfiddle.net/r6kbjeud/8/ This is the same code in two different places. But this one shows a polygon instead of a triangle http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qOpxbG Why does I suffer duch_kazatel? max-width didn't save me either :\
[16:52:17] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela hourly is fine depending on what they're looking for - you're really quoting how many hours, not how much each is worth.
[16:52:19] <xniz> hmm... maybe I will just outline all the services I offer, and leave the pricing to contracts like you said
[16:52:42] <duch_kazatel> xniz yep - do those one on one.  have your base hourly price and then show people how many hours things can take.
[16:53:04] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: how i'm going right now is upfront weekly and i tell them that none of my estimates in terms of time are bonafide, that it's just upfront weekly however long it takes. and if there's no payment, the work stops
[16:53:20] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela that's one way to do it.
[16:53:34] <duch_kazatel> but when they stop and they didn't provide you any notice, that's a waste of your time.
[16:53:57] <duch_kazatel> now you need to spent time to find another client to replace them - so you should really have a stipulation about some kind of notice ahead of time.
[16:54:06] * derekZero_ floats between two dimensions like jQuery purgatory. 
[16:54:17] <duch_kazatel> 2 weeks to 30 days.  that way you have time to find your next client in case things get wonky.
[16:54:19] <Kamuela> i don't disagree with that, except you're just building in more things to chase, aren't you duch_kazatel
[16:54:31] <Kamuela> i'd rather just put that into that weekly number, incorporate all costs there
[16:54:33] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[16:54:39] <duch_kazatel> you have to value your time.
[16:55:09] <Kamuela> I do, that's why I charge weekly. And in that time is not just raw hours worked, but it incorporates what I lose when I lose a client
[16:55:09] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ what are you expecting to happen?
[16:55:24] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela then you're penalizing your active clients on a false pretense ;)
[16:55:48] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel I wish everything would happen the way it does in the jsfiddle. But my browser shows me what happens in the pencode insted :O No comprende
[16:55:59] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: i'm just trading risk for money
[16:56:05] <xniz> oh yeah also... http://goldbuyersva.com was my first official web design/code job. I made $500
[16:56:17] <duch_kazatel> i can't make you change, but that's why a lot of places require you to provide cancellation ahead of time.
[16:56:20] <duch_kazatel> saves you headaches down the road.
[16:56:34] <xniz> there are some pages i need to re optimize for mobile, but it was an easy job, (and for my boss anyways) so i didnt think about money
[16:56:35] <duch_kazatel> xniz huh? i'm seeing the same issue on both.
[16:56:38] <duch_kazatel> err, derekZero_
[16:56:39] <Kamuela> no I'm not arguing just for the sake of arguing, I value your experience because I know it's a lot more than my own
[16:57:29] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel I've played with width and max-width to find they have similar consequences.... I don't know what to poke next...
[16:57:48] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ again, what should it look like instead?
[16:58:00] <duch_kazatel> like, only extend out far enough to have the triangle and no wider?
[16:58:22] <derekZero_> It should bounce toggle into a triangle. Not a polygon duch_kazatel
[16:58:28] <derekZero_> Yes
[16:58:38] <derekZero_> But without sacrificing the bounce.
[16:59:02] <derekZero_> I can make it extend into a perfect triangle, but only with a linear effect even thought I'm using easeOutBounce
[16:59:10] <derekZero_> though*
[17:00:00] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r6kbjeud/9/embedded/result/
[17:00:03] <duch_kazatel> so like this?
[17:00:28] <derekZero_> Correct
[17:00:37] <duch_kazatel> so max-width ;)
[17:00:51] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r6kbjeud/9/
[17:00:55] <derekZero_> :O You poked the #parent....
[17:01:35] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel You sir, must be a mage.
[17:01:52] <DubstepCraig> Is there a way for me to define a function to run after a click event from within that click event?
[17:02:06] <duch_kazatel> wut
[17:02:27] <Zzaichik> haha
[17:02:39] <derekZero_> mage = magician duch_kazatel
[17:02:48] <duch_kazatel> i meant DubstepCraig
[17:02:54] <derekZero_> ah
[17:02:58] <kfrz> I'm working in .net, using selenium and jquery extensions to write integration tests
[17:03:26] <kfrz> Is there a "best practice" or "better" way to select elements from an angular page rathe than just straight - up $("") jquery
[17:03:41] <kfrz> I mean to say, is there a way to use the angular stuff on the page (not familiar with ang)
[17:03:42] <duch_kazatel> kfrz you can use native selectors.
[17:03:48] <DubstepCraig> Example: <div onclick="dothis() dothisaftertheclickevent()"> - is this possible?
[17:03:52] <duch_kazatel> kfrz otherwise, go to an angular channel.
[17:03:56] <duch_kazatel> DubstepCraig woah.
[17:04:01] <duch_kazatel> so 1: don' use onclick
[17:04:08] <DubstepCraig> I have too :(
[17:04:11] <duch_kazatel> why?
[17:04:22] <DubstepCraig> Because I am using a templating system
[17:04:22] <Kamuela> Still watching that vid duch_kazatel
[17:04:27] <duch_kazatel> DubstepCraig so?
[17:04:47] <duch_kazatel> DubstepCraig is it that things wouldn't work with the new elements as you were adding them to the page?
[17:05:07] <DubstepCraig> Exactly
[17:05:12] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[17:05:48] <DubstepCraig> It's kinda messy because I'm using ajax too
[17:05:50] <Doxin> so I'm having trouble getting the size of an image. it seems to always return 0x0 even though I made sure the image is visible and loaded when this function gets called: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/POQ5I7BeOGAgkzMIiJGB/
[17:05:57] <duch_kazatel> DubstepCraig that's fine - same difference.
[17:06:00] <duch_kazatel> delegation is what you want.
[17:06:07] <DubstepCraig> Okie dokie
[17:07:10] <kfrz> duch_kazatel: native to Angular? I googled but to no avail
[17:07:31] <duch_kazatel> kfrz native to the browser.  otherwise, i'd look for channel specific to angular.
[17:08:19] <kfrz> ok
[17:08:37] <Kamuela> kfrz: #angularjs
[17:13:28] <kfrz> Thanks guys
[17:13:37] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: is there an example somewhere of a contract to use?
[17:15:22] <xniz> alright...
[17:15:26] <xniz> duch_kazatel, http://goldbuyersva.com/xnizstudio/services.html :P
[17:15:31] <xniz> no numbers
[17:15:41] <xniz> obviously, ill have to spice the page up a bit on the layout end.. but mehh
[17:17:05] <Doxin> so I'm having trouble getting the size of an image. it seems to always return 0x0 even though I made sure the image is visible and loaded when this function gets called: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/POQ5I7BeOGAgkzMIiJGB/
[17:17:40] <xniz> brb smoke
[17:22:51] <F^3> Is it possible to append an audio element (with controls enabled) from a blob url? It appends the audio element, but shows the play button greyed out, time 0:00, and the speaker muted.
[17:23:43] <duch_kazatel> Doxin can you make a fiddle?
[17:23:53] <duch_kazatel> also, that's a lot of code to get an image size?
[17:24:18] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: well obviously it's doing stuff to the images asides from getting their size.
[17:24:31] <duch_kazatel> right, but your issue is trying to get image size ;)\
[17:24:57] <duch_kazatel> check this out http://stackoverflow.com/a/17089832/923919
[17:24:57] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: look, I can totally make a fiddle and then in the fiddle it'll work perfectly, and I'll be none the wiser.
[17:25:11] <duch_kazatel> woah duder
[17:25:14] <duch_kazatel> no need to get snippy.
[17:25:20] <Doxin> wasn't intended as snippy
[17:25:40] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: my point is, I don't think I can extract the problem from my code.
[17:25:49] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.
[17:25:56] <Doxin> ...
[17:26:18] <duch_kazatel> why can't you?
[17:26:35] <Doxin> look, I'll try, but I bet it'll work fine in the damn fiddle.
[17:26:48] <duch_kazatel> and what would that tell you?
[17:27:49] <duch_kazatel> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hnqnv9q6/
[17:28:06] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: that I'm doing something mysterious wrong. I'm already aware of that.
[17:28:36] <duch_kazatel> i think you might want the native naturalWidth and naturalHeight
[17:28:49] <Doxin> yeah trying that now
[17:29:40] <Doxin> naturalWidth and naturalHeight are undefined.
[17:29:50] <duch_kazatel> how are you using them?
[17:29:57] <duch_kazatel> $('img').naturalWidth ?
[17:30:05] <Doxin> no, this.naturalWidth in an event
[17:30:21] <duch_kazatel> and you're sure 'this' is the correct scope?
[17:30:29] <duch_kazatel> err, context
[17:30:47] <Doxin> yes.
[17:30:52] <duch_kazatel> dunno then!
[17:30:53] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[17:31:07] <Doxin> I can't even get the load event to fire in the jsfiddle
[17:31:15] <duch_kazatel> mind showing me what you've got?
[17:31:48] <Doxin> sure, sec
[17:32:05] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: this should be what I'm doing in my actual code as well roughly https://jsfiddle.net/2xdnskom/
[17:32:23] <Doxin> ah actually the real code is different, but lets get that event working first.
[17:32:42] <duch_kazatel> err.
[17:32:55] <duch_kazatel> well, that'll never really work because the load event is firing before you bind the listener./
[17:33:36] <Doxin> ah you're right I dun goofed. sec
[17:34:30] <duch_kazatel> so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xdnskom/1/
[17:34:50] <Doxin> yes that
[17:34:58] <Doxin> that should be what I'm doing in my code exactly
[17:35:24] <duch_kazatel> so you're creating the img tag and binding to it before appending anything?
[17:35:53] <Doxin> yes
[17:36:23] <duch_kazatel> wait crap.
[17:36:30] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: relevant code: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/FNJyPAFug0ZGX0VP9qmO/
[17:36:41] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: if all images are loaded it calls the function that tries getting the size
[17:36:45] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xdnskom/2/ doesn't work.
[17:37:01] <Doxin> how so?
[17:37:07] <xniz> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIcM21l61TE <--- this one played after the link you gave me duch_kazatel ... sounds interesting heh

[17:37:09] <duch_kazatel> ... look at it.
[17:37:23] <duch_kazatel> Doxin it's not functioning ;)
[17:37:28] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: I am getting a nice 600x400 in my console, although somehow the image isn't loading
[17:37:33] <duch_kazatel> Doxin right.
[17:37:35] <duch_kazatel> that's my point.
[17:38:07] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: I have the exact opposite problem. the image shows but no size.
[17:38:23] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xdnskom/3/ you have something closer to this.
[17:38:48] <Doxin> I very well don't.
[17:38:56] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[17:38:58] <duch_kazatel> you very well do?
[17:39:12] <Doxin> I don't call append inside the onload
[17:39:14] <duch_kazatel> you create an image, bind a listener, and append that image within the listener.
[17:39:15] <Doxin> I call it after.
[17:39:24] <duch_kazatel>  imagelist.append(img)
[17:39:30] <duch_kazatel> you sure do call it in the handler.
[17:39:33] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: oh
[17:39:38] <Doxin> I can see how that's confusing
[17:39:48] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: imagelist is not an element
[17:40:05] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: the last line in my paste is the actual appent
[17:40:07] <Doxin> *append
[17:40:18] <duch_kazatel> so you're not giving me the full story.
[17:40:30] <duch_kazatel> so you have an element that you're appending images to that you then append to the document
[17:40:32] <duch_kazatel> right?
[17:40:34] <Doxin> no.
[17:40:41] <duch_kazatel> i give up then.
[17:41:02] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: #staging is just some element. imagelist is an object that happens to have an append method that just sticks the element in a list for imagelist.reflow to use
[17:42:06] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I'm diving into developing my own jQuery plugin.. My question might be stupid so bear with me: how do I know from inside the plugin what div was it called upon?
[17:42:21] <duch_kazatel> Doxin i see the issue.
[17:42:23] <hydraidm801> having trouble building a string line 15 https://jsfiddle.net/reoqje8o/2/
[17:42:24] <Doxin> oh?
[17:42:51] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xdnskom/5/ is ultimately what you want.  you need to bind the listener before you add the source for the image.
[17:43:00] <Doxin> oh
[17:43:03] <Doxin> duh
[17:43:03] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ the 'this' object.
[17:43:09] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: but
[17:43:15] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: my onload /does/ get called
[17:43:26] <duch_kazatel> Doxin i'm seeing that is NOT the case in this fiddle.
[17:43:27] <duch_kazatel> soooo..
[17:43:29] <Kamuela> yea I liked the just pay me talk, I'd say the part that most interests me is the defensive aspect of it, and how everything is very clear
[17:43:41] <Doxin> yeah dummyimage is too fast for it to work that way :P
[17:43:53] <duch_kazatel> Doxin try it my way.  see if that works.
[17:43:59] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: I just did. same problem
[17:44:10] <duch_kazatel> Doxin dunno then mang.  sorry
[17:44:26] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 ou can't do multiline strings like that.
[17:44:36] <Doxin> ah!
[17:44:40] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: I managed to replicate it
[17:45:06] <hydraidm801> duch_kazatel, I did that for code clarity, its all on one line on my machine
[17:45:12] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/s90a3eut/ seems to exhibit the same error
[17:45:21] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 ... not very clear then ;)
[17:45:24] <duch_kazatel> show us the code you have.
[17:46:20] <hydraidm801> duch_kazatel, https://dpaste.de/GXKv
[17:46:21] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: I forgot a small bit: https://jsfiddle.net/s90a3eut/2/
[17:46:22] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, I see, is there any way I can have an array of options like (img1,img2,img3..imgN) ?
[17:46:46] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 $.each(json.__all__[0].code, function(k, v) { doesn't make sense - that's a string.
[17:47:27] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[17:47:30] <duch_kazatel> you should read these.
[17:47:41] <ZeuZ> I'm on them but the (options) part I don't quite get
[17:48:01] <duch_kazatel> basically, 'this' represents all the elements that were selected.
[17:48:21] <duch_kazatel> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#using-the-each-method
[17:49:08] <hydraidm801> I need help with line 15 https://jsfiddle.net/reoqje8o/2/
[17:49:16] <duch_kazatel> ...'
[17:49:39] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 don't link code that doesn't match what you have - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/reoqje8o/3/
[17:49:44] <duch_kazatel> also: look at your console
[17:49:54] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, not sure that's entirely what I meant.. I mean suppose this: $("divA").plugin(img1,"text1",img2,"text2"..,imgN,"textN");
[17:50:06] <ZeuZ> the idea is do for each tuple, one thing
[17:50:20] <ZeuZ> like with img1 and text1, one thing, img2, text2, another thing
[17:50:31] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ not a tuple ;)
[17:50:43] <duch_kazatel> so you want all the args passed to the plugin?
[17:50:48] <ZeuZ> yeah :P
[17:51:00] <ZeuZ> sorry haha dunno why the word tuple came to my head :P
[17:51:02] <duch_kazatel> that's... kind of gross.
[17:51:31] <duch_kazatel> but you'll basically need to use the arguments object.
[17:51:42] <duch_kazatel> why are you supplying arguments like thjat?
[17:52:21] <ZeuZ> just because I thought it would be confortable
[17:52:27] <ZeuZ> comfortable*
[17:52:34] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ eeeh... use an object for options.
[17:52:36] <hydraidm801> duch_kazatel, did you change anything? Cause I didn't see anything work
[17:52:40] <duch_kazatel> and pass in an array of stuff.
[17:52:53] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 i updated it to match the code from your other paste.
[17:53:35] <duch_kazatel> Doxin easy
[17:53:50] <duch_kazatel> var img = $("<img>"); - img is a jquery object.
[17:54:45] <duch_kazatel> jquery objects don't inherit DOM properties and methods - need to access the underlyng element for that to work - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s90a3eut/3/
[17:54:52] <duch_kazatel> that's why 'this' works but 'img' doesn't
[17:55:26] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 your entire $.each() doesn't work because you're trying to enumerate on a string.
[17:55:32] <hydraidm801> ah its the hash
[17:55:40] <hydraidm801> the hash is what messes up the string
[17:55:44] <duch_kazatel> json.__all__[0].code is #id_start_date_0
[17:55:49] <duch_kazatel> why are you running each on a string?
[17:56:06] <hydraidm801> its not a string here
[17:56:09] <hydraidm801> its an array
[17:56:20] <hydraidm801> I made a simplified version for the fiddle
[17:56:20] <duch_kazatel> so you meant json.__all__?
[17:56:37] <hydraidm801> json.__all__.code is an array
[17:56:38] <duch_kazatel> your simplified version wasn't indicative of your actual code then ;)
[17:56:47] <duch_kazatel> but ok
[17:56:50] <hydraidm801> well all I asked was for help with one stirng
[17:56:53] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:57:06] <duch_kazatel> and i was pointing out that the entire $.each() wasn't working.
[17:57:12] <hydraidm801> I was very specific and figured it out myself
[17:57:12] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, ok and to get each object on the array passed as arguments?
[17:57:14] <xniz> thanks for the talk guys. nite!
[17:57:35] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 nothing in what you gave us what helpful on our end :) glad you figured it out though.
[17:58:07] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#accepting-options
[17:58:32] <duch_kazatel> so you'd basically do $.fn.myPlugin = function(options) { options.someArray };
[17:58:55] <duch_kazatel> then you have $('.someClass').myPlugin({someArray: [1, 2, 3]});
[17:59:31] <ZeuZ> oh then I think I messed up my design
[17:59:47] <ZeuZ> let me show you something then you can tell me how it could work or how to redesign it
[18:01:16] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, http://pastebin.com/CCHKqaSc
[18:01:34] <ZeuZ> in that example, (and sorry for the annotations) how can I tap into each object?
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> arguments
[18:02:14] <ZeuZ> but arguments[0] would be the first? or how do I use the $.expand() ?
[18:02:28] <duch_kazatel> the arguments object IS the array in this case.
[18:02:47] <duch_kazatel> traditionally, you'd pass in a plain object.
[18:02:47] <ZeuZ> oh cool, so arguments[n] wouuld represent each object, correct?
[18:04:11] <duch_kazatel> and you can't use "arguments" as the name.
[18:04:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rbkhzrbv/
[18:04:38] <duch_kazatel> your slide1 and slide2 object were invalid btw.
[18:05:47] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, :O wait, why?
[18:05:54] <duch_kazatel> it's a reserved word
[18:06:20] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments
[18:07:51] <ZeuZ> oh sorry, I meant why the objects were invalid
[18:08:12] <duch_kazatel> you were missing a key in both of them.
[18:08:31] <duch_kazatel> https://bpaste.net/show/30a7d17caab5
[18:08:37] <duch_kazatel> the subtext items are invalid.
[18:09:51] <ZeuZ> oh, stupid me.. I forgot that yeah.. now, in the example you shared it prints out the name of the div they were called upon, how would I do the console.log() on the url key of each one?
[18:10:08] <duch_kazatel> the what now?
[18:10:35] <duch_kazatel> the example i shared is enumerating through all the slides you passed in.
[18:10:50] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rbkhzrbv/ --> instead of foo bar baz as a result, log "url" and "url2"
[18:11:08] <ZeuZ> for each of the divs
[18:11:10] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:11:14] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't log foo bar baz.
[18:11:25] <duch_kazatel> do you have your developer tools open?
[18:12:37] <ZeuZ> I was compleately looking other place entirely sorry, I get it now
[18:12:40] <ZeuZ> at least for now :P
[18:12:41] <ZeuZ> thanks!
[18:12:46] <duch_kazatel> cool
[18:13:50] <Doxin> how do I pass stuff to a callback in the context of a for loop? doing for(i=0;i<10;i+=1){var foo=data[i]; $(...).on("load",function(){<do something with data>})} doesn't work since it only ever operates on the last value foo gets
[18:14:01] <duch_kazatel> Doxin that's a really bad idea.
[18:14:09] <duch_kazatel> generating functions with for loops is pretty bad.
[18:14:22] <Doxin> so how do I do this then?
[18:14:29] <Doxin> because it's not optional functionality.
[18:14:31] <duch_kazatel> attach data to notes using data attributes.
[18:14:36] <duch_kazatel> *nodes
[18:14:52] <Doxin> how does that help.
[18:15:02] <duch_kazatel> then you access that data within the event handler.
[18:15:23] <Doxin> oh DUH
[18:15:26] <Doxin> I can just use this
[18:15:32] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[18:29:51] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/rbkhzrbv/1/ ---> why doesnt it show the images?
[18:30:08] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[18:31:42] <duch_kazatel> there are a couple things going on.
[18:32:05] <duch_kazatel> first off, there's no "crearSlider" - there's a "createSlider".
[18:32:12] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/rbkhzrbv/2/ --> "Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of undefined)
[18:32:27] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[18:32:34] <duch_kazatel> so 'this' inside that forEach() isn't the element.
[18:32:51] <duch_kazatel> since the function is getting called from within forEach(), not the plugin.
[18:33:19] <ZeuZ> how should I get the div then?
[18:33:32] <duch_kazatel> first off, $("div_destino")
[18:33:35] <duch_kazatel> fix your selector.
[18:34:04] <duch_kazatel> second off, you can create a variable that you assign to 'this' in your handler, or bind the forEach callback to the correct context.
[18:35:33] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/rbkhzrbv/3/ --> that doesn't error but still no image..
[18:35:53] <duch_kazatel> don't do $(div)
[18:35:57] <duch_kazatel> just div is sufficient
[18:36:13] <duch_kazatel> and look at the inline styles on the images...
[18:36:20] <duch_kazatel> visibility:hidden;
[18:37:39] <ZeuZ> getting rid of iti, the images appear like broken, although the link is valid..
[18:37:58] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[18:37:59] <ZeuZ> does that happen because of jsfiddle or is there something wrong still?
[18:38:16] <duch_kazatel> google is likely blocking you from doing that.
[18:38:47] <ZeuZ> but the browser is able to reach the link on its own
[18:39:03] <duch_kazatel> right.  google is not allowing you to load that logo image on other pages.
[18:39:26] <duch_kazatel> imagine what would happen to their hosting if they allowed everybody to just load that logo on any page they wanted?
[18:39:30] <Doxin> how do I get the size of the browser viewport? that is *excluding* the part you can scroll to. doing $(window).height() gives me a number that's larger than my screen even is.
[18:40:19] <duch_kazatel> Doxin you sure about that?
[18:40:38] <duch_kazatel> $(window).width() should be correct.
[18:40:50] <Doxin> duch_kazatel: height
[18:40:55] <duch_kazatel> same story.
[18:40:57] <Doxin> I'm getting 6901 pixels height
[18:41:00] <duch_kazatel> .height() should be fine.
[18:41:01] <duch_kazatel> hr,,,
[18:41:03] <duch_kazatel> *hrmmm
[18:41:33] <duch_kazatel> window.innerHeight
[18:41:56] <Doxin> yeah that works
[18:49:43] <mrtAkdeniz> hey guys
[18:50:04] <mrtAkdeniz> I have a problem but have no idea is it releated to jquery or angularjs
[18:50:23] <mrtAkdeniz> i'm using jquery for in page effects
[18:50:41] <mrtAkdeniz> if I use alert(); before function, effects work
[18:50:54] <mrtAkdeniz> but if I delete alert, effects stop working..
[18:51:16] * duch_kazatel looks at his magic crystal ball
[18:51:20] <duch_kazatel> weird.  i can't see your code.
[18:51:35] <mrtAkdeniz> you want whole angular project?
[18:51:51] <duch_kazatel> the relevant code might be nice?
[18:51:55] <duch_kazatel> dunno how you expect us to help.
[18:52:00] <mrtAkdeniz> ok wait a sec
[18:53:39] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, http://codepaste.net/cahnaj
[18:53:46] <mrtAkdeniz> oops sorry
[18:54:05] <derekZero_> What's the best resource for learning to build a jQuery slider from scratch?
[18:54:16] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ you mean like a carousel?
[18:54:18] <mrtAkdeniz> hmm jsbin also need resources
[18:54:22] <derekZero_> yes
[18:54:30] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[18:54:58] <derekZero_> thx
[18:54:59] <duch_kazatel> build something that you can actually use instead :)
[18:55:41] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, it is a template, and have 4-5 js file, css files etc
[18:55:53] <duch_kazatel> mrtAkdeniz so let's back way up.
[18:56:03] <duch_kazatel> because you're convoluting this :)
[18:56:03] <mrtAkdeniz> which part you want idk, and I pasted angular part
[18:56:26] <duch_kazatel> you have a document ready that runs .css() - that .css() doesn't work unless there's an alert there?>
[18:56:39] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel guh... I still want to learn it. Oh well.
[18:56:39] <mrtAkdeniz> nope, css part is working
[18:56:47] <mrtAkdeniz> but animations won't work
[18:56:53] <duch_kazatel> what animations?
[18:57:04] <mrtAkdeniz> transition?
[18:57:06] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ i wouldn't learn how to build something you shouldn't ever really use in the first place.
[18:57:19] <duch_kazatel> mrtAkdeniz... so the css transitions aren't working?
[18:57:23] <duch_kazatel> the ones you apply with .css()?
[18:57:29] <mrtAkdeniz> yeah
[18:57:37] <mrtAkdeniz> but if I use alert before it, after click ok on alert
[18:57:41] <mrtAkdeniz> effects work
[18:57:53] <mrtAkdeniz> I mean, items load with effect as needed
[18:58:02] <duch_kazatel> okay - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k2v448f1/1/ add the relevant markup here then.
[18:58:06] <mrtAkdeniz> without alert, they are on there with no move, just there..
[18:58:09] <duch_kazatel> not all the angular stuff, just the relevant html.
[19:00:34] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, so.. I downloaded the images, placed them in the same directory and changed the paths to relative paths, and the images still won't load :(
[19:01:14] <ZeuZ> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/rbkhzrbv/4/
[19:01:24] <ZeuZ> filenames I have checked
[19:01:41] <ZeuZ> they won;t load there, of course, but should load here.. right?
[19:01:45] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/mrtakdeniz/k2v448f1/4/
[19:02:18] <mrtAkdeniz> here you go, I added also css but this messageses opacity is 0
[19:02:23] <mrtAkdeniz> but did not find on there..
[19:04:36] <duch_kazatel> ZeuZ there's no URL property on any of those objects.
[19:04:43] <duch_kazatel> there's an img property though.  is that what you mean?
[19:05:53] <duch_kazatel> mrtAkdeniz i don't see it doing anything in there even with the fiddle.
[19:05:54] <ZeuZ> D'ough! silly me, better take a break, sleep depravation plus non being proficient is hampering me
[19:06:10] <duch_kazatel> *even with the alert in the fiddle.
[19:06:39] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, yeah i know.. this template uses js for it
[19:06:45] <mrtAkdeniz> let me upload whole project to server
[19:06:47] <mrtAkdeniz> so you can see?
[19:06:49] <duch_kazatel> no.
[19:06:52] <duch_kazatel> isolate the issue.
[19:06:52] <mrtAkdeniz> ok :(
[19:07:11] <duch_kazatel> so what SHOULD be happening here?
[19:07:12] <mrtAkdeniz> what you mean by isolate?
[19:07:29] <mrtAkdeniz> oh i got it, i tought you told "skip it."
[19:07:30] <duch_kazatel> i mean your issue is apparently with trying to apply css transitions, not your entire angular app.
[19:07:49] <arc_> protip: if you are going to automatically tab me over when i finish entering the proper number of characters into your field, preventdefault on tab when one of those fields is focused
[19:08:27] <duch_kazatel> mrtAkdeniz huh?
[19:08:33] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, template uses some algorithm for change page
[19:08:40] <mrtAkdeniz> and angular uses ngroute for change page..
[19:08:47] <duch_kazatel> mrtAkdeniz i don't understand what that has to do with applying css transitions.
[19:09:00] <mrtAkdeniz> if I show you template's naked form -without angular- you can understand me i think..
[19:09:10] <duch_kazatel> wut
[19:09:26] <duch_kazatel> i don't know angular, and what you're asking me is how to make a css transition work.
[19:09:34] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, http://washington.bitballoon.com/messages.html
[19:09:36] <mrtAkdeniz> here you go
[19:09:40] <mrtAkdeniz> click a message
[19:09:44] <mrtAkdeniz> and you'll understand me
[19:09:51] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[19:09:55] <duch_kazatel> this doesn't help me help you.
[19:09:58] <duch_kazatel> sorry!  good luck :)
[19:10:59] <mrtAkdeniz> i can't show you what is my problem without upload to server.. :S
[19:11:01] <mrtAkdeniz> it is impossible
[19:11:26] <mrtAkdeniz> just give me a min to upload it. but problem is simply that, if I use alert, effects work, if I won't, effects won't.
[19:11:29] <duch_kazatel> you need to isolate your issue from your angular code.
[19:11:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to look at it if you upload it.
[19:11:37] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[19:11:55] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, no worries, thanks for your time :\
[19:12:19] <duch_kazatel> for the record, your issue is with css transitions applied via jquery, not angular.
[19:16:09] <_August_> ​/j #​#bootstrap
[19:21:37] <mrtAkdeniz> duch_kazatel, yeah i know, i did it. angular have methods for dom manipulations?
[19:22:06] <duch_kazatel> dunno - you'd need to find their docs or a channel about angular.
[19:42:26] <_August_> can someone take a quick at this? i am trying to add this onto my site but for some reason the animation is very laggy and isnt accurate for when it triggers via the if statement
[19:42:28] <_August_> http://pastebin.com/KkrQvjQP
[19:43:23] <duch_kazatel> eeek
[19:43:31] <duch_kazatel> okay, coupla problems here.
[19:43:39] <_August_> lay it on me
[19:43:46] <duch_kazatel> 1: notice how often the scroll event fires?
[19:44:01] <_August_> yeah everytime the window scrolls
[19:44:12] <duch_kazatel> right, so any time you cal $() is sloooowwww
[19:44:35] <duch_kazatel> so anything you can select ahead of time is a win.
[19:45:02] <_August_> i wasnt sure wha twas a good function to use for that, im trying to calculate when a element hits the top of the window then it would tigger the animation
[19:45:46] <duch_kazatel> so this https://bpaste.net/show/45e9a38454e9 is a better place to start.
[19:45:48] <duch_kazatel> but wait!
[19:45:57] <duch_kazatel> you're also queueing up a bunch of .animate() calls.
[19:46:01] <duch_kazatel> that's also a no-no.
[19:46:53] <duch_kazatel> you should also add/remove a class and detect for that on top of your scrollTop() comparison
[19:47:07] <_August_> thought about it
[19:49:49] <_August_> this still make the animation not trigger accuratly, the padding doesnt go to 0 until after a few secs
[19:49:53] <_August_> http://74.124.200.188/~leogold/
[19:49:59] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle instead yo.
[19:50:06] <_August_> scroll down to the black menu
[19:50:14] <duch_kazatel> iiif you make a fiddle instead ;)
[19:50:29] <_August_> ok
[19:50:33] <_August_> its really weird tho
[19:51:05] <duch_kazatel> why not just use sticky.js?
[19:52:02] <_August_> didnt want to change since its pretty much working with bootstraps affix
[19:52:05] <duch_kazatel> or any of the other plugins out there?
[20:03:59] <gambl0re> hey guys, i have a question
[20:11:10] <jphase> :\
[20:13:03] <hydraidm801> how can I set a global variable inside an onclick ?
[20:13:30] <duch_kazatel> avoid doing that in the first place.
[20:13:51] <duch_kazatel> and don't use onclick=
[20:14:10] <hydraidm801> k once again I'm asking a very specific question
[20:14:35] <duch_kazatel> and i'm letting you know the base approach is flawed ;)
[20:14:40] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you just set it.
[20:15:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/08m39s4u/
[20:15:47] <hydraidm801> I try to set $.CurrentDate.month = 10 on click but later when I try to call it its not there
[20:16:06] <duch_kazatel> does $.CurrentDate exist?
[20:16:27] <duch_kazatel> and are you sure that $ is truly global
[20:18:09] <hydraidm801> I set $.CurrentDate = new Object at the begining
[20:18:26] <hydraidm801> I just assumed $ would be global
[20:18:34] <duch_kazatel> don't use new Object - use {};
[20:18:43] <hydraidm801> why so?
[20:18:44] <duch_kazatel> and check to make sure $ exists and is global.
[20:18:50] <duch_kazatel> new Object() is slower and unnecessary.
[20:18:58] <duch_kazatel> object literals don't carry around the extra cruft, too.
[20:19:30] <hydraidm801> like all the getters and setters?
[20:19:44] <duch_kazatel> don't use getters and setters if you can avoid it.
[20:20:08] <hydraidm801> you should write a book. Javascript: Don't use it!
[20:20:20] <duch_kazatel> crockford already wrote it ;)
[20:20:32] <hydraidm801> well he talks about the good parts
[20:20:38] <duch_kazatel> it's called JavaScript: The Good Parts.  coupla things i disagree with, but he covers topics like that.
[20:20:59] <hydraidm801> I've read it many times. Its right here next to me on my desk
[20:21:06] <duch_kazatel> good :)
[20:21:36] <hydraidm801> It's mostly a book of gotchas but there is some great stuff in it
[20:21:54] <duch_kazatel> i'm well aware.
[20:22:01] <duch_kazatel> the object and array literal stuff is good.
[20:23:44] <arc_> did you change your nick because of that one guy who kept misspelling it :p
[20:24:01] <duch_kazatel> lol this was the name he was misspelling.
[20:24:05] <duch_kazatel> oh wait it wasn't.
[20:24:07] <duch_kazatel> derp.
[20:24:10] <duch_kazatel> and nah, was hiding.
[20:24:11] <arc_> robertmatrix
[20:24:14] <arc_> oic
[20:24:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah i remember that now.
[20:24:21] <duch_kazatel> so frustrating.
[20:24:25] <arc_> lolz
[20:27:01] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/317223/ <--- is this so wrong?
[20:28:11] <duch_kazatel> it's broken, yeah.
[20:28:29] <duch_kazatel> and you can just use forEach()
[20:30:25] <duch_kazatel> you're missing a closing curly and closing paren.
[20:30:35] <duch_kazatel> var img[i] = $('<img class="'img'+i">'); is really strange.
[20:30:42] <duch_kazatel> img is undefined.
[20:31:32] <duch_kazatel> you're aslo missing some plus signs there.
[20:32:59] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[20:34:06] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/317224/ something like this?
[20:38:52] <shoky> Kartagis:  imageUris.forEach(function(uri) { $('<img class="img">').attr('src', uri).appendTo('#otherpicture'); })
[20:40:51] <shoky> Kartagis: or for better performance do the actual DOM append only once at the end:  var images = imageUris.map(function(uri) { return $('<img class="img">').attr('src', uri)[0]; });  $('#otherpicture').append(images);
[22:41:02] <MinusGix> Can't you change the text of a button like: $(".buttonName").text("a Name") ?
[22:43:26] <rcyr> TIAS?
