[01:54:56] <IAG> hey guys
[01:55:28] <IAG> I just want to ask some advice how to learn jquery
[01:56:57] <Zarthus> please do not pm users
[01:57:03] <Zarthus> just ask your question
[02:25:00] <[E]sc> is there something wrong with the jqueryui custom theme roller? or am i just a retard that doesn't know how to use it properly? because the custom css scope doesn't get added to my css file until after the component containers or is that what is supposed to happen?
[04:01:12] <Firzen> Trying to set up a pagecontainer widget with two pages in one HTML document. They have data-role="page" and class="jqr-page". I assumed (documentation didn't tell me) I had to call $('.jqr-page').pagecontainer() to initialize it, then like $('#idofonepagediv').pagecontainer('change') to change to the page? My Fx console tells me there was an error in the jQuery mobile lib when calling toPage. Unfortunately I can't find a backtra
[04:01:12] <Firzen> ce. Any idea what I could be doing wrong?
[04:04:11] <Firzen> Do I have to include jquery-ui manually when using jquery-mobile?
[04:12:06] <Firzen> Am I maybe confusing features? Does the $.mobile.changePage function load a website via AJAX and display it without technically moving to another website? Is the pagecontainer widget thing that allows the definition of multiple pages in one HTML document/on one site, then switching between them a jquery-ui feature?
[04:48:25] <lenswipe> hey guys
[04:48:27] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/pfs2Ch53
[04:48:39] <lenswipe> I'm trying to make it so that each instance of that fades out after creation
[04:48:44] <lenswipe> right now they all fade out at the same timec
[04:48:55] <lenswipe> can someone tell me how I *should* be doing it
[04:50:21] <lenswipe> nevermind
[04:50:22] <lenswipe> i figured it out
[05:14:46] <binni> is it possible to make jquery ui resizeable plugin use percentages instead of pixels (px)? my div's width is defined in % but when I use the plugin it turns it into px
[05:18:03] <rved> i have a hidden <select> ... on the responsive mobile website, i want an a href click to open the select option on mobile phones
[05:18:09] <rved> how do i do this with jquery?
[05:18:19] <rved> i was thinking like
[05:18:26] <rved> $('#btn-range-select').click(function(e){ $('#range-select select > option ').focus();
[05:18:42] <rved> select.click
[05:18:45] <rved> something like that
[05:18:48] <rved> instead of focus
[06:46:10] <ZeuZ> I've got this textarea, ID='results', I want to change the text to the response of my server in an ajax response, preserving what was there allready, I've tried $('results').text($('results'.text() + data) but textarea contents won't change, what am I doing wrong?
[06:51:46] <decx> ZeuZ $('#results').text(function(_,text){ return text + data });
[06:57:35] <ZeuZ> decx, ain't there a more direct, or easy way?
[06:57:57] <decx> how much more direct can it be?
[06:59:09] <decx> if you don'T want to do anything else with the existing text you can juts do $('#results').append(data)
[07:02:01] <ZeuZ> decx, not working, though
[07:02:13] <decx> your error is somewhere else then
[07:02:31] <ZeuZ> http://fulldownloads.webege.com/index.html?datos=1234test1234 -> the third time you hit "Probar" it'll load a text file into the Resultado textarea..
[07:02:41] <ZeuZ> the data is in the variable, because alerting it shows it
[07:03:00] <ZeuZ> but yet it won't get loaded into the textarea
[07:04:11] <decx> <textarea id="Resultado"
[07:04:18] <decx> $('Resultado').append
[07:04:29] <decx> check your selector
[07:04:46] <ZeuZ> $('Resultado').append(data);
[07:05:10] <ZeuZ> check the javascript file at http://fulldownloads.webege.com/script.js
[07:05:13] <decx> $('#id'), $('.class'), $('tag'), $('[attribute]')
[07:05:21] <ZeuZ> oh damn
[07:05:22] <ZeuZ> got it
[07:05:26] <decx> ;)
[07:08:52] <ZeuZ> is there any way to, say, have something happen in the middle or each time a ajax request receives data?
[07:11:46] <decx> beforeSend
[07:11:52] <decx> use it like .success
[07:12:06] <binni> Does anyone know if the ui components in the following URL are part of some HTML5 UI Kit or if it's specifically designed by Webflow for their own use?: https://webflow.com/img/marketing/feature-big-style.png
[07:21:32] <decx> it's just a stylesheet binni

[08:38:53] <decx> ;)
[08:41:15] <BillCriswell> Sundays are stupid.
[08:44:27] <decx> that's just the effect of its vicinity to monday
[08:54:32] <BillCriswell> decx: Fair enough.
[08:54:55] <michelem> hello folks
[08:55:13] <BillCriswell> Ayyyy
[08:55:23] <michelem> I make a blocking ajax() call to test availability and auth in an API. I need to return such availability to the caller.
[08:56:21] <michelem> I tried testfun = function { return $.ajax({ async: false, … error: function() { return false; }}); }. This does not work. What's the right way?
[09:00:22] <BillCriswell> What do you expect testfun to be michelem?
[09:01:25] <Hyperking> Hello, Im looking for a small ajax plugin for my static site. any suggestions?
[09:02:34] <BillCriswell> You'd have to be more specific Hyperking.
[09:02:45] <BillCriswell> What do you want it to do... just make an ajax request?
[09:03:23] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: looking for a plugin that will load pages into a div without refreshing browser
[09:03:37] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: You could just use jQuery's .load for that.
[09:03:40] <decx> the smallest "plugin" ;) $('a').click(function(){ $('#main').load($(this).attr('hre)+' #main')})
[09:03:51] <decx> hre even
[09:04:10] <decx> the fuck
[09:04:14] <BillCriswell> decx: haha
[09:04:15] <decx> hre
[09:04:27] <Hyperking> the plugin would need to update head data and body class
[09:04:39] <decx> i just cant write 'hre i think my replacer script is not good enough
[09:04:42] <Hyperking> decx: too small lol
[09:05:17] <decx> oh right i replace f ' on my inputs because you're all in the f network on my bnc ;)
[09:05:46] <michelem> got it. For the archives, the trick is to define, inside the ajax callbacks, a variable local to the caller function. The caller function then returns that variable after the synchronous ajax call
[09:08:32] <BillCriswell> michelem: sjax isn't typically a good practice.
[09:09:59] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: What does your source data look like? If you have a JSON file or something like { css: ['foo.css', 'bar.css'], page: 'foo.html', title: 'Foo' } you could read that and do the things youw ant with what's returned.
[09:10:34] <Hyperking> BiillCriswell: source data is all static html files
[09:11:46] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: Just just want to grab some html elements from it and put it into the current page?
[09:11:53] <michelem> I'm aware of that. I accept the blocking for the length of the timeout I specified
[09:12:37] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: yes, and update the title, meta content and body class after ajax
[09:15:30] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: That would just be a lot of picking out parts of the source HTML. Not sure you'd find something specific enough to do that?
[09:20:07] <decx> roll it yourself, a multipurpose plugin will just be overbearing
[09:29:36] <djam90> I have a simple script where you click "Delete" button and it will delete an image by ajax. but at the moment it just hides the div containing it. code is here: http://pastebin.com/FmFvi80K  But I am unable to do it more than once. I can't delete more that one...
[09:31:41] <decx> looks like you have multiple buttons with the id deleteImageButton
[09:31:55] <djam90> ohhhhhhhhh damn
[09:31:56] <djam90> yeah
[10:10:24] <LindsayMac> anyone here remember a while back a website being posted across a few of the web design inspiration blogs that had a giant grid of every lego mini fig ever made? I am trying to find that again
[10:11:57] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: you can check http://irc.jquery.org/
[10:12:05] <ryanneufeld> and see if you can find the link in the backlogs

[10:12:24] <LindsayMac> Oh I have NO IDEA if it was ever even mentioned in here
[10:12:34] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:12:55] <LindsayMac> I'm not going to filter through logs either.. i'm just asking in here because if there is someone else who remembers it, they might be here

[11:28:52] <Vytenis> Hello. As I read from documentation a mouseenter event should be run only once as mouse enters? Am I right?:)
[11:30:11] <Tori> Vytenis: yes that is right
[11:30:12] <ummk> When I run this code I get that my function callbackCount is not defined, http://pastebin.com/xtGTEZHy cant it load functions from external files?
[11:35:15] <Vytenis> Hm. So I am doing everything right, how ever can`t find the reason why the scroll is not working. It seems that somehow the script under mouseenter is repeated always (from the developer tools I can see this), how ever can`t figure out what is causing this strange behavior. Maybe somebody have seen this situation?
[11:35:38] <Vytenis> Code is realy simple: http://pastebin.com/LnzscsGG
[11:51:17] <skinux> Is jQuery.Min truly light-weight or simply lighter than jQuery "full"?
[11:54:45] <Vytenis> Could it be that ajax load makes "ignore" mouseenter event and after it the new "mouse enter" is initiated?
[12:04:03] <Vytenis> So anybody has an idea how to make ajax load of content and not to "reload" "mouseenter" event?
[12:07:24] <rafaelrinaldi> Vytenis: do you really need to make this request every time when `mouseenter` is fired?
[12:07:52] <Vytenis> rafaelrinaldi: yes I do. The cart content can be updated
[12:12:31] <rafaelrinaldi> Vytenis: can you upload a snippet on JSBin or any equivalent so we can see what's going on for ourselves?
[12:18:54] <decx> load('index.php?route=module/cart > *') is probably the problem
[12:19:24] <decx> what's the > * supposed to do
[12:23:23] <Vytenis> rafaelrinaldi: tryed to include ajax call with full link. http://jsbin.com/fozupeje/2/ . (cleaned out php to get the full idea). decx: it is in the default call made in shopping cart core. How ever after deleting the call nothing changed
[12:25:22] <decx> there's no jquery loaded
[12:27:21] <decx> f'Vytenis http://jsbin.com/fozupeje/3/edit
[12:28:22] <Vytenis> decx: updated my link. The strange thing is that it works there as intended. The scroll is working. How ever at my development platform it reloads ;o
[12:29:43] <Vytenis> http://laikinas.graztai.lt/drills is the link. Issue is with adding x (x>7) different products into the cart. I want to have a normal scroll. How ever it doesn`t allow to scroll. AS in http://jsbin.com/fozupeje/2/ (with all the code) it is working normaly
[12:34:53] <tona> how can i get one value in one  tag <input  using jquery i am trying to ge it using var valor=$("#txtvalor1").attr();

[12:44:05] <tona> and what should i do with it
[12:44:28] <Vytenis> decx, rafaelrinaldi: thank you for trying to help. Made a workaround tho the problem for performance still exists :)
[12:45:15] <tw2113> set up a minimal example of what you're trying to do and presently failing with

[13:07:43] <tona> i have typpe evetything
[13:08:04] <kartoffeldenndoh> Hi, maybe someone is so friendly to check following example: http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/
[13:08:04] <tona> http://jsfiddle.net/FeHxP/
[13:08:05] <LindsayMac> tona:  save and share the link here please
[13:08:37] <tona> done
[13:08:47] <kartoffeldenndoh> I want to show Table "xxx" by hovering Table row "jojo"
[13:10:27] <tona> LindsayMac  http://jsfiddle.net/FeHxP/ here the code
[13:10:54] <LindsayMac> tona:  http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/FeHxP/1/
[13:11:31] <LindsayMac> the selector is the identification for the element that you want to pull the info from. In this case I gave it the id="txt_name" and then told the JS to get the value of the element with the id of txt_name
[13:11:51] <LindsayMac> then just made a quick keyup function to show you that you can make an alery everything you type something and get the new updated value
[13:13:27] <tona> ok thank you very much
[13:13:55] <kartoffeldenndoh> Hi, maybe someone is so friendly to check following example: http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/
[13:13:58] <kartoffeldenndoh> I want to show Table "xxx" by hovering Table row "jojo"
[13:22:43] <NicoJuicy> anyone knows knockout? (there isn't anyone answering in their channel)
[13:23:40] <tona> LindsayMac one queston more i promise the last for today, when i click one button i am getting one name and with that name i can look up information on mysql using php , but the big question how could i link jquery send two parameteres to php language and return the result to put it on jquery
[13:26:41] <kartoffeldenndoh> Hi, maybe someone is so friendly to check following example: http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/
[13:26:41] <kartoffeldenndoh> I want to show Table "xxx" by hovering Table row "jojo"
[13:28:52] <LindsayMac> tona:  you have to serialize it send it as JSON or something like that.
[13:28:58] <lareth> Hello, how can I create an external function that calls jquery? when I call this function from the console in dev tools, i get undefined.
[13:29:05] <LindsayMac> tona:  THAT is a lot more work, however.. if you dont know what you're doing especially
[13:39:52] <NicoJuicy> Anyone knows how to fix this knockoutjs binding? http://jsfiddle.net/DMf8r/
[13:40:37] <tona> LindSayMac just ask you a good manual to start, i know php just jquery i am learning
[13:41:41] <LindsayMac> tona:  google "sending info from jquery to php"
[13:41:50] <LindsayMac> tona:  also read up on JSON to PHP
[13:42:03] <NicoJuicy> then it's not hard
[13:42:17] <NicoJuicy> then you need $.get :p
[13:42:42] <NicoJuicy> for getting info
[13:42:46] <NicoJuicy> and $.post for posting it
[13:43:01] <NicoJuicy> any the serialize function before posting
[13:43:23] <LindsayMac> NicoJuicy:  umm... what you just said makes ZERO sense to someone who is new to this
[13:43:28] <tona> ok thank guy
[13:43:36] <LindsayMac> so yea.. it kinda IS that hard.
[13:43:44] <kartoffeldenndoh> Hi, maybe someone is so friendly to check following example: http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/
[13:43:44] <kartoffeldenndoh> I want to show Table "xxx" by hovering Table row "jojo"
[13:43:49] <LindsayMac> not impossible, but hard if you have no idea what you're doing.
[13:44:08] <NicoJuicy> just go to the jquery website and lookup ajax, post & get
[13:44:20] <tona> ok
[13:44:21] <LindsayMac> kartoffeldenndoh:  i looked at your example and have no clue what you're asking.. what is table-xxx ?
[13:44:25] <NicoJuicy> what do you want to do with that example?
[13:45:27] <NicoJuicy> ps. you didn't include the jquery library
[13:46:05] <kartoffeldenndoh> NicoJuicy thanks for reply... do u see the table row with content "1 2 3"? I want to show another table when the mouse hovers about this table row.
[13:46:27] <kartoffeldenndoh> Oh yeah, stupid me.
[13:46:56] <kartoffeldenndoh> Still not working. ^^
[13:47:24] <NicoJuicy> You want to show another table when hovering a row inside the table?
[13:47:33] <NicoJuicy> it's a dynamic generated table?
[13:47:48] <kartoffeldenndoh> Yes, exactly. No, static content.
[13:47:50] <LindsayMac> can't you just do that with CSS ?
[13:48:04] <NicoJuicy> not if it's dynamic i suppose, that's why i'm asking ;)
[13:48:05] <kartoffeldenndoh> Not in the way I want to do it. I think I believe so.
[13:48:09] <LindsayMac> #table tr:hover #othertable { }
[13:48:16] <NicoJuicy> it's a dynamic generated table ;)
[13:48:36] <NicoJuicy> http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/3/
[13:48:39] <NicoJuicy> (not fixed yet)
[13:50:08] <kartoffeldenndoh> Usually I have more than one row and I want to show different content each row. How to "adresse" each row via CSS?
[13:50:40] <LindsayMac> just because it's dynamically generated doesn't mean you can't use CSS
[13:50:41] <NicoJuicy> http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/4/
[13:50:42] <NicoJuicy> now it's fixed
[13:50:42] <NicoJuicy>    $("table.xxx").fadeIn("slow").show(); instead of $(this).find("table.xxx")
[13:50:53] <kartoffeldenndoh> Ah now I remember my problem. I want to use an effect. I think it's only possible with jquery.
[13:50:58] <NicoJuicy> Fixed... http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/4/
[13:51:07] <NicoJuicy> liek i said 2 minutes ago :p
[13:51:10] <NicoJuicy> like...
[13:51:16] <NicoJuicy> 3 :P
[13:51:24] <LindsayMac> kartoffeldenndoh:  you can use CSS3 transitions
[13:51:50] <NicoJuicy> kartoffeldenndoh http://jsfiddle.net/X2X88/4/
[13:51:52] <NicoJuicy> jeeez
[13:51:59] <kartoffeldenndoh> Aaaaaahhhh... okay... like u see I'm kinda new to this stuff. Thank you very so much!
[13:52:04] <NicoJuicy> k ;)
[13:52:12] <NicoJuicy> you understand the mistake?
[13:52:17] <kartoffeldenndoh> That makes sense now. ^^
[13:52:19] <kartoffeldenndoh> Ye.
[13:52:22] <NicoJuicy> great
[13:52:46] <kartoffeldenndoh> Things can be so easy sometimes. ^^
[13:54:07] <kartoffeldenndoh> Thank you again and have a nice day.

[15:20:39] <oik741> Hi guys, please help me, i try to redefine behavior of SUBMIT action on form
[15:20:39] <oik741> $(document).on('submit','form[data-async]', function(event) { $(this).ajaxForm(options)});
[15:20:39] <oik741> this handler works only on second, third click
[15:21:32] <oik741> but if i'm replace function(event) with ajaxForm(options) everythings seems ok, but i can't prevent default =)
[15:21:53] <oik741> *default behavior
[15:22:26] <lareth> I have the code in http://jsfiddle.net/YE8RV/ and I am trying to hide some tr elements in a table. When I try that in the "hiding" code in the console it wokrs fine. When I try that on the actual click event, it works only partly (only the first selector (before the comma) is triggered. How can I fix that?
[15:23:18] <ryanneufeld> lareth: none of your td's have the class comment
[15:23:51] <lareth> These are the "trigger" td that I am shoiwng with the click event
[15:24:18] <lareth> let me update the code there with a sample from the tds with the class comment
[15:26:01] <ryanneufeld> either way, what I would do, is put a data- attr on the links
[15:26:18] <ryanneufeld> and have that attr contain a class or id for what needs to be hidden
[15:26:22] <ryanneufeld> then just use that as your selector
[15:27:54] <lareth> ryanneufeld updated http://jsfiddle.net/YE8RV/1/
[15:28:42] <lareth> Can you please give an example as I am really still learning in the front end world.

[15:37:00] <alexherbo2> Hi
[15:37:32] <alexherbo2> which plugin provide similar functionnality to https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-smooth-scroll ?
[15:37:46] <alexherbo2> It does not work for me.
[15:37:54] <alexherbo2> http://alexherbo2.github.io/wiki/exherbo.html
[15:38:10] <alexherbo2> https://github.com/alexherbo2/alexherbo2.github.io/blob/source/assets/coffee/script.coffee#L65
[15:38:31] <alexherbo2> (plain javascript works)
[15:38:50] <alexherbo2> node_reference.get(0).scrollIntoView() #L65
[15:38:55] <alexherbo2> but no smoothly
[15:40:39] <ryanneufeld> `demo @alexherbo2
[15:40:39] <b-ot> alexherbo2: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:41:48] <ryanneufeld> alexherbo2: are you using coffeescript?
[15:46:57] <alexherbo2> ryanneufeld: yes
[15:47:09] <ryanneufeld> try #coffeescript then
[15:47:27] <alexherbo2> it is not coffeescript problem
[15:47:31] <alexherbo2> specific
[15:47:36] <ryanneufeld> doesn't look like a jquery problem
[15:47:58] <ryanneufeld> if the code works as is, but not when put through coffeescript, where then would the problem be?
[15:49:07] <alexherbo2> (plain javascript works) = when not using jquery smooth scroll plugin
[15:49:28] <alexherbo2> but using built-in scrollIntoView()
[15:50:04] <alexherbo2> the issue is that smoothScroll() (jquery) does just nothing
[15:50:53] <ryanneufeld> what does the code look like that's calling it?
[15:51:44] <alexherbo2> https://github.com/alexherbo2/alexherbo2.github.io/blob/master/js/script.js#L80
[15:52:08] <ryanneufeld> alexherbo2: that's not what I asked
[15:52:22] <ryanneufeld> you're including the library
[15:52:37] <ryanneufeld> oic
[15:53:05] <ryanneufeld> you're changing the node reference many times
[15:53:12] <alexherbo2> scrollTo seems works
[15:53:18] <alexherbo2> but is buggy
[15:53:24] <ryanneufeld> what does console.log(node_refernce) give you?
[15:53:31] <ryanneufeld> is it a jquery object, or a dom node
[15:53:38] <alexherbo2> very slow
[15:53:43] <ryanneufeld> try $(node_reference).smoothScroll();
[15:54:36] <ryanneufeld> and it looks like you're using https://raw.github.com/balupton/jquery-scrollto/gh-pages/lib/jquery-scrollto.js not the one you linked before
[15:55:13] <alexherbo2> ryanneufeld: updated a quite of times
[15:56:18] <alexherbo2> $(node_reference).smoothScroll() does not work better
[15:56:18] <ryanneufeld> quite of times?
[15:56:33] <alexherbo2> ryanneufeld: many times
[15:56:45] <ryanneufeld> you're supposed to just load smoothscroll liek this $('a').smoothScroll();
[15:56:55] <ryanneufeld> so any link, will use the smooth scroll
[15:57:18] <ryanneufeld> alexherbo2: https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-smooth-scroll
[15:57:22] <ryanneufeld> check the readme.md
[15:57:41] <alexherbo2> why this restriction ?
[15:57:54] <ryanneufeld> restriction?
[15:57:58] <ryanneufeld> it's convenience
[15:58:13] <ryanneufeld> you just specify which anchor tags you want it applied to
[15:58:24] <ryanneufeld> that's generally how jquery plugins work
[15:58:39] <ryanneufeld> selectsomething-dot-dosomefunction()
[15:58:45] <alexherbo2> it can only jump on anchor ?
[15:58:52] <ryanneufeld> I don't know
[15:58:59] <ryanneufeld> if you read the docs, you'd know
[15:59:15] <ryanneufeld> but typically navigation is done with links
[15:59:26] <alexherbo2> anchor will mess with history
[15:59:38] <ryanneufeld> doesn't need to
[15:59:44] <ryanneufeld> all it will do is change the hash
[15:59:51] <ryanneufeld> Add back button support by including a history management plugin such as Ben Alman's BBQ. See demo/bbq.html for an example of how to implement this.
[15:59:57] <ryanneufeld> from the smoothscroll documentation
[16:00:38] <alexherbo2> ryanneufeld: it implies my headers should be link
[16:00:44] <alexherbo2> i don’t want :D
[16:01:01] <alexherbo2> it is not convenience to me
[16:01:22] <ryanneufeld> what
[16:01:23] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:01:48] <ryanneufeld> why would your headers have to be links?
[16:02:17] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[16:08:45] <everett> I have a text input inside a div, and that div listens to click events through jQuery
[16:09:01] <everett> how do I prevent clicking inside the text input from triggering the event?
[16:17:11] <BillCriswell> everett: You could do $('div').on('click', ':not(input)', doSomething);
[16:21:56] <BillCriswell> everett: Oops.
[16:21:58] <BillCriswell> That's actually wrong.
[16:23:52] <BillCriswell> everett: http://jsbin.com/kekarufi/1/edit?css,js,output might work
[16:23:56] <BillCriswell> Well, does work.
[16:36:18] <zalem-developer> i'll probably get kicked out the room for asking such a stupid question.  i have an input type of 'button' and when clicked....it displays a calendar...when the date is picked, it posts back to my controller.  i don't want the value of my button to change to the date...how can I prevent this?  thanks
[17:09:54] <ryanneufeld> everett: check the event object that's passed into your click handler like I do here http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/
[17:14:28] <zalem-developer> anyone have a good example of a button when clicked displays a calendar and when a date is selected, it posts back to an action in a controller?
[17:14:42] <ryanneufeld> jquery ui date picker
[17:15:15] <zalem-developer> yes, i'm using that but i'm having problems
[17:15:41] <zalem-developer> http://pastebin.com/HNNrSEd9....i don't want the text on the button to change
[17:19:14] <ryanneufeld> zalem-developer: it's crude, but it seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/9pw33/
[17:20:20] <zalem-developer> i don't see a date picker when i click the button
[17:20:33] <ryanneufeld> zalem-developer: odd
[17:20:34] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-altField
[17:20:44] <ryanneufeld> zalem-developer: it works for me
[17:21:22] <zalem-developer> tried it in firefox and safari....the calendar doesn't show
[17:22:16] <ryanneufeld> zalem-developer: why do you need it to be a button?
[17:22:25] <ryanneufeld> typically people use this on a text field
[17:22:57] <zalem-developer> because it will be the only textfield on the screen and it looks rather tacky
[17:23:08] <zalem-developer> weird that it only works in IE
[17:23:17] <ryanneufeld> that is weird
[17:23:19] <ryanneufeld> it works fine here
[17:23:42] <ryanneufeld> The thing is though, you're gonna have to put the date in an input field
[17:23:50] <zalem-developer> i'll have to find a different way then
[17:23:59] <ryanneufeld> you can also style the inputs to look better
[17:24:09] <ryanneufeld> I'd ask around tomorrow durring the day
[17:24:15] <ryanneufeld> it's pretty slow in here today
[17:24:20] <zalem-developer> i'm using bootstrap....i wanted to use their version to do modals/datepickers...and it doesn't work in IE
[17:24:22] <zalem-developer> so I was trying this
[17:24:37] <ryanneufeld> it should work in IE
[17:24:43] <ryanneufeld> that's the point of it
[17:24:46] <ryanneufeld> isn't it?
[17:24:47] <zalem-developer> i'm an iOS developer and I got given this crappy stuff to finish up
[17:25:26] <zalem-developer> well....i couldn't get it to work...it worked fine in other browser
[17:25:45] <zalem-developer> https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker/issues/17
[17:26:46] <zalem-developer> thanks for trying to help...i do appreciate it
[18:41:03] <mdev> anyway exciting/major changes coming to the next version of jquery?
[18:49:30] <Moult> can i use jquery to simulate a file drag and drop event?
[20:22:01] <tona> hello guys
[20:22:15] <tona> when can i post value in jquery to php
[20:22:40] <tona> i just want to post one value, how could i do it
[20:25:13] <Moult> tona: ajax?
[20:26:40] <tona> but could you give a example
[20:28:31] <kneekoo> tona: for an example it would help if you would be more specific about your need
[20:29:59] <pragma-> I have needs that I need.
[20:30:19] <kneekoo> :D
[20:31:13] <kneekoo> pragma-: so have I the need for my needs to need me as I need them
[20:31:26] <tona> ok , basically i have one button when i press it , i want to send one value like one name and process it into another file , but basically i want to post one value , i know how php can get that value, just the problem is how to post one simple value
[20:32:20] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm having an issue I'll try to explain to the best of my ability...here is the paste: http://jsbin.com/wajisiha/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output    basically, those 3 tabs at the bottom(featured, 5% back, and Find A Store) are running on the jquery i pasted in there...they work good mostly, but they're kind of glitchy, and i don't know why, if you mess with them a bit, they end up doing some really weird things like
[20:32:20] <bobbobbins> toggling in reverse...I'm not sure how to correct it, can someone help out?
[20:33:09] <kneekoo> tona: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[20:33:15] <kneekoo> $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[20:33:29] <kneekoo> would that help?
[20:34:57] <tona> then name and time two post right ?
[20:35:24] <bobbobbins> i tried adding a stopPropagation in there to see if that would help, but it didn't do anything
[20:36:22] <kneekoo> tona: to post a single value you can do this: $.post( "test.php", { var_name: "value" } );
[20:36:41] <tona> ok
[20:36:51] <tona> thank i really appreciated your help
[20:38:03] <kneekoo> it's like having a regular form with a single value, like <input type='text' name='var_name' value='your_value'> and you would post it in the traditional way with <input name='submit' type='submit' value='Submit your data'>
[20:38:14] <kneekoo> ok, I hope it will work for you :)
[20:39:01] <tona> ok i am retrieving the value with  echo $_GET["valor"]; but it doesnt show me anything, i have $.post("obtenerdatosporingeniero.php",{valor:"20"});
[20:40:18] <shoky> post sends a POST, not a GET
[20:40:51] <kneekoo> tona: use echo $_POST['valor']
[20:41:16] <tona> in fact of i have change it before and it doesnt work yet
[20:41:29] <tona> i am missing womething but i dont know what is that?
[20:41:31] <kneekoo> or if you really need GET, then $.get( "test.php", { var_name: "value" } );
[20:41:44] <tona> ok let my try
[20:42:31] <tona> no i have changed it and i can not see any value
[20:43:05] <shoky> ?paste
[20:43:06] <b-ot> shoky: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:43:11] <Moult> tona: posting your code might help, it sounds like a pebkac error
[20:43:12] <pragma-> ?
[20:43:19] <pragma-> ??
[20:43:24] <tona> ok let me write
[20:43:37] <pragma-> ??foo
[20:43:43] <pragma-> ?foo
[20:43:47] * pragma- stares at b-ot
[20:44:24] <kneekoo> tona: you said you wanted to post one simple value, so you can do that now
[20:44:47] <tona> yes but i want to reover in seconf file
[20:44:57] <kneekoo> if you also want to display it, then you need ajax
[20:45:17] <tona> why
[20:45:33] <kneekoo> ajax sends some data to a script and also offers you the result of that script
[20:45:35] <shoky> $.get and $.post are ajax
[20:46:04] <tona> then how should i post the info using ajax
[20:46:23] <shoky> with $.get or $.post is fine
[20:46:54] <tona> it like the above lines described here
[20:47:02] <shoky> yes
[20:47:32] <tona> but i have used it and i am not able to see my value in seconf file
[20:47:39] <shoky> and we told you to post some code.
[20:47:57] <tona> ye you are right
[20:49:53] <tona> here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/YZ8RR/
[20:50:16] <bobbobbins> anyone have a chance to look at mine? Its driving me crazy
[20:50:16] <tona> these lines are into my file
[20:54:17] <shoky> tona we've already seen this code. you are not being helpful
[20:55:30] <tona> ok let me paste all my code
[20:56:18] <tona> http://jsfiddle.net/YZ8RR/2/
[20:56:45] <tona> you can go the last part where say mensaje1
[20:59:10] <bobbobbins> here is my code again: http://jsbin.com/wajisiha/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[21:02:38] <tona> shoky have you seen the last part where say mensaje1 , i dont knwo waht i am missing
[21:03:45] <shoky> tona:  looks ok. though i see you're including the same .php that youre sending the ajax to, its embedded in this page.. not sure what you're trying to do there
[21:05:54] <tona> ok , one single screen i am handling two differents contents you know one graphic, when one user click one special color, it will return one list on another part on my screen
[21:06:30] <tona> it is clean my explanation shoky
[21:07:02] <tona> shoky if you have a example how to post one value and recover for me is ok , it will help me so much
[21:12:35] <bobbobbins> if anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated, I've been stumped for days now
[21:28:01] <tona> can i post one value with jquery and use this value posted in same file , i want these because i need to process two datas on same page
[21:36:28] <tona> ok i have the solution and i would like to share this information guys .ajax can not post one value on the same page rather than we should use this
[21:36:29] <tona> window.location = "http://127.0.0.1/paperless/graficas.php?valor=10";
[21:37:57] <Moult> tona: by the way, your code exhibits quite a few poor coding practices (i'm looking at the php you threw up on jsfiddle) - might want to consider recoding it
[21:38:56] <shoky> bobbobbins:  an easy fix is to give more space to "#tabs ul"   that currently has left: 50.2%
[21:39:14] <shoky> e.g. change to 40%
[21:39:39] <bobbobbins> shoky: can you explain how that would fix it? i'm not sure i follow
[21:40:30] <shoky> er actually thats not a good fix, only works on certain sizes
[21:40:56] <shoky> bobbobbins: when you slideToggle the content div it's causing the <ul> width to suddenly jump and not fit in the half-window size you gave it
[21:41:21] <bobbobbins> oh, but if i do that, won't the tabs themselves be spaced that far apart too?
[21:41:25] <shoky> which causes the floating <li>'s to jump some
[21:43:26] <bobbobbins> hmm, i just tried it and it didn't fix the issue
[21:58:06] <shoky> bobbobbins: my real recommendation is to use  * { box-sizing: border-box }   and fix-up the few minor issues it introduces. because it's much much nicer and easier to work with
[21:58:19] <EvanCarroll> is the quickest way to create elements in jquery, or to create a tree using $("<tag>", {attr list});
[21:58:23] <EvanCarroll> or, is there a faster way?
[21:59:55] <BillCriswell> EvanCarroll: The quickest way would be with document.createElement Id imagine, but I doubt it's saving enough time to worry about it?
[22:00:57] <Intii> Hey all, I'm having some trouble with superscrollorama and navigation links. The navigation doesn't jump to the right place. I tried the solution here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18457577/play-through-pinned-elements-in-superscrollorama but that doesn't work for me either.
[22:01:02] <BillCriswell> shoky: Dang right.
[22:01:17] <Intii> I know the chief problem is the who we are section animating. What can I do to fix it? Here is the site: http://198.199.68.66/element18-animate/#
[22:09:40] <Jonno_FTW> hi
[22:10:12] <Jonno_FTW> I have a slider that changes the value of an input field, how do I detect the change in value?
[22:10:40] <Jonno_FTW> $('#slider_value').change() doesn't work
[22:13:37] <shoky> bobbobbins: did some of it for ya.. http://jsbin.com/wajisiha/5/edit
[22:14:51] <shoky> Jonno_FTW: depends on what slider you're using. you need to use one of their events/callbacks
[22:15:28] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[22:15:38] <bobbobbins> huh, so far so good, i can't get the problem to replicate yet, thanks!
[22:15:46] <Jonno_FTW> shoky: i'm using jquery-ui
[22:16:38] <Jonno_FTW> nvm I found it
[22:51:15] <DelicateFlower> is there a function that does f("div", "hello") -> "<div>hello</div>"?
[22:52:33] <Jonno_FTW> DelicateFlower: why don't you write it yourself?
[22:53:01] <Jonno_FTW> you don't even need jquery for it
[22:53:01] <DelicateFlower> Jonno_FTW: well if there is one, I ought not to reinvent the wheel
[22:53:11] <Jonno_FTW> it's 1 line
[22:53:43] <Moult> DelicateFlower: I have a script, but it costs 5USD per website per month. pm me for details.
[22:54:09] <Jonno_FTW> function f(html,content) return "<"+html+">"+content+"</"+html+">";
[22:54:19] <Jonno_FTW> that'll be $4.99 please
[22:54:25] <Moult> nooooooo :D
[22:55:13] <Jonno_FTW> html attributes are $2.99 extra
[22:56:44] <DelicateFlower> yeah but what if i want to add optional attribute features?
[22:56:52] <DelicateFlower> suddenly it's not so simple
[22:57:09] <DelicateFlower> and it seems like something jquery would have
[22:58:16] <BillCriswell> You could do $('<div>', { html: "Whatever", "class":"snazzy" });
[23:00:47] <tw2113> why does jquery core need to provide html constructor functions?
[23:00:56] <DelicateFlower> never say need
[23:01:06] <DelicateFlower> never said*
[23:01:13] <tw2113> but you expected it to have something like that
[23:04:36] <DelicateFlower> does it?
[23:05:01] <BillCriswell> You just need to make a string.
[23:08:50] <basiclaser> how can i prevent this number from rounding up? www.basic-laser.com/100b You can see that it is rounding up if you compare it to the number in the page tab. how prevent this?
[23:12:47] <Cork> basiclaser: what is the math your doing when you get the rounding?
[23:37:49] <DelicateFlower> can i append a jquery object to a dom object?
[23:39:46] <Cork> DelicateFlower: well jquery works with dom objects
[23:39:53] <Cork> the jquery object is just a wrapper
[23:39:59] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[23:43:48] <DelicateFlower> i want to use the after method which is on a jquery object
[23:43:54] <DelicateFlower> but i want to use it on a dom object
[23:44:07] <greg5green> $(yourdomobjecthere).after
[23:44:07] <Cork> so wrap the dom element with jquery
[23:44:12] <Cork> ya
[23:44:26] <greg5green> im not sure if the after method has it
[23:44:42] <greg5green> but you can all a lot of the methods with $.method(object, regular args too)
[23:44:54] <greg5green> or else, im full of crap and im making that up
[23:45:03] <greg5green> because as i said it, it sounded kind of dumb
[23:45:19] <greg5green> but the first part is DEFINITELY TRUE
[23:45:34] <pragma-> greg5green: please use less drugs
[23:45:56] <greg5green> dont worry, this insanity is only caused by using dojo at my day job
[23:49:11] <Cork> greg5green: $.method and $().method is never the same
[23:49:46] <Cork> in the core jquery that is
[23:49:57] <Cork> some plugins might do the same in both
[23:52:29] <greg5green> $().map/$.map
[23:52:33] <greg5green> $().each/$.each
[23:52:37] <greg5green> $().data/$.data
[23:52:43] <jnor> hi, I'm using a popup menu script (bootstrap). When a link is clicked a function clearmenu() is called and the navbar is closed quickly before pageload. Can I somehow repress this behaviour without editing bootstrap js?
[23:53:06] <greg5green> 3 examples of things that do the same thing, just with a slightly different path because of the arguments
[23:53:10] <Cork> greg5green: and all of those are doing totalyl different things
[23:53:28] <Cork> $.map is for generating arrays $().each will generate jquery objects
[23:53:35] <Cork> opps $().map
[23:53:37] <Cork> same for .each
[23:53:44] <greg5green> touche
[23:53:54] <Cork> data is an exection ya
[23:54:01] <Cork> it works the same with both
[23:54:09] <Cork> but it is the only one
[23:54:33] <greg5green> and even with $().map, it would still call $.map
[23:54:38] <Cork> greg5green: $.map and $().map is as much the same thing as $().filter and $.grep
[23:54:42] <greg5green> or at least ht epirvate function
[23:55:10] <Cork> they both work with arrays, but that is about it
[23:55:20] <greg5green> filtering and maping an array are much
[23:55:33] <greg5green> different
[23:55:51] <Cork> greg5green: $.grep filters the values in an array
[23:56:00] <Cork> and returns a new array with the matched values
[23:56:09] <greg5green> yes, as expected
[23:56:11] <Cork> $().filter filters the dom elements matching the selector
[23:56:23] <Cork> and returns a new jquery object with the matched elements
[23:56:36] <Cork> the different is the same as for $().map and $().each
[23:56:46] <Cork> *difference
[23:57:02] <greg5green> yes, that is true, but i did not read your language to mean that
[23:57:03] <Cork> only difference is that .grep has another name
[23:57:25] <Cork> so no $.map and $().map is NOT the same thing
[23:57:39] <greg5green> there is a slight difference
[23:57:53] <Cork> there is a big difference
[23:58:25] <Cork> $().map(function() { return this.value; }) won't give you an array of the values
[23:58:43] <Cork> it will give you a broken jquery object where it tries to use strings as dom elements
[23:59:14] <Cork> $.map($(), function(elm) { return elm.value; }) will on the other hand give you an array
[23:59:15] <Cork> with strings
