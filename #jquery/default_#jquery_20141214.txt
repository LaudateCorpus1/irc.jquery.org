[02:40:38] <sorush20> does accordion only work with h3
[02:42:38] <simi> sorush20, ?
[02:51:48] <sorush20> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[02:51:57] <sorush20> its only working with h3
[02:57:18] <kerunaru> sorush20: http://jsfiddle.net/vwvmdgh4/
[03:17:17] <sorush20> kerunaru: I wonder if there are any conflicts
[03:19:34] <sorush20> here is my site
[03:19:43] <sorush20> http://islingtontrainingcourses.co.uk/v2/index.php/microsoft-excel-expert
[03:27:48] <kerunaru> Well… You have an error in your script :)
[03:28:38] <kerunaru> sorush20: check your browser's console
[03:33:23] <sorush20> I honestly haven't got a clue how to fix this , I'll have to change jobs.
[03:33:51] <sorush20> I know enought css and html but java script and jquery none
[03:34:12] <sorush20> this is a damd nightmare
[03:36:53] <kerunaru> sorush20: Ok. You need to put a dot after the $ sign
[03:37:23] <kerunaru> sorush20: $searchword -> $.searchword for example
[03:38:22] <kerunaru> sorush20: Oh! Sorry, my fault… That's fine
[03:38:47] <sorush20> I just did and the accordion isn't appearing
[03:42:25] <sorush20> i guess thats that then
[03:46:46] <kerunaru> Try to change jQuery(function($) to $(document).ready(
[03:57:00] <kerunaru> sorush20: And you need to tidy up your page a little bit (U^_^). Put all the logic you want on the ready event in the same $(document).ready() declaration
[04:06:04] <sorush20> no your speaking to a brick wall I'm just not ready for jquery I have no idea about where the brakets go
[04:06:27] <sorush20> have a look now but nothing has happened
[04:22:11] <kerunaru> sorush20: You have a H4 tag misplaced
[04:22:20] <kerunaru> sorush20: Lesson Seven:
[04:22:45] <kerunaru> Put that outside the div like the others H4
[04:23:06] <kerunaru> I only want to rip off the errors and then let see if we can make this work ;)
[04:35:20] <jdo_dk> Does anyone know, if it is possible to search google, but using jquery ?
[04:35:43] <Woet> jdo_dk: what are you trying to do? what is your end goal?
[04:36:32] <jdo_dk> I want to hit "google" with 3 different queries and see the "hits" on each query/search. Some kind of "battle" between 3 queries
[04:37:35] <jdo_dk> Woet: ^^
[04:39:56] <Woet> jdo_dk: google no longer offers their search API, so you can't do it
[04:40:14] <jdo_dk> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&q=stack
[04:40:21] <jdo_dk> What about that one ?
[04:42:38] <Woet> jdo_dk: pretty sure it's deprecated
[04:42:55] <jdo_dk> But if i can get results using it. :)
[04:43:28] <Woet> just be aware it can go down at any time
[04:46:02] <jdo_dk> Sure. :)
[05:12:59] <DaniG2k> is there a good js image cropping tool out there?
[05:13:11] <DaniG2k> the most popular one I'm seeing is jcrop which is 2 years old :\
[05:13:21] <DaniG2k> seems to be the de-facto javascript image cropping tool
[05:14:59] <OnceMe> hello
[05:15:04] <OnceMe> how can I protect my DOM from XSS attack?
[05:15:24] <OnceMe> such as $('.div').append("<script>alert("xss");</script>");
[05:16:52] <OnceMe> I tried text.replace(/[!"#$%&'()*+,.\/:;<=>?@[\\\]^`{|}~]/g, "\\\\$&");
[05:16:54] <OnceMe> does not work
[05:17:46] <sonotos> DaniG2k: like http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html
[05:18:17] <DaniG2k> sonotos: yes that seems to be the one everyone uses
[05:18:50] <sonotos> and you don't like it cause it's 2 years old?
[05:19:40] <DaniG2k> sonotos: I'm just wondering if it will depend on an old version of jquery
[05:20:02] <sonotos> no it doesn't
[05:20:22] <DaniG2k> k
[05:20:25] <DaniG2k> I'll give it a shot
[05:20:32] <OnceMe> .html() worked

[08:28:06] <ilithium> Afternoon all :)
[08:28:48] <ilithium> Quick Q for anyone conscious: is there a selector for any element which has specific attribute, i.e. I want to find all elements which have the 'data-helper' attribute
[08:36:49] <ilithium> Ah, found it - the solution is $('[attributename]')
[08:53:24] <Justice> Say you create a div in jquery code and want to add something after that specific div? Append inserts and After  does nothing
[08:53:26] <Justice> ideas?
[09:36:52] <shoky> .after() works for me
[09:37:34] <shoky> well, assuming the div was added to the dom
[09:42:54] <Justice> shoky: hm that may be the issue but i solved it actually by using append in jquery but on another place in the code.
[09:43:31] <Justice> shoky: more like this = http://codepad.org/GYTzN5Yt
[09:43:51] <Justice> though im getting blank icons on the button for some reason.

[09:47:53] <sharax> Exactly the same as it would
[09:48:06] <sharax> Where do I start?
[09:50:58] <systemfault> Hmm...
[09:51:03] <systemfault> What?
[09:52:39] <sharax> I would like this site to work
[09:53:01] <sharax> Separate pieces of information but beautiful
[10:48:13] <stangeland> I am calling a server which returns a binary image stream by doing $('.myimg').attr('src','/myimgresource/p1=1&p2=2'). It takes some secs to generate the image. Is there some easy way to show a load bar while the request is waiting?
[10:49:41] <RizziCR> stangeland: u can use lazyload plugin
[10:50:03] <stangeland> RizziCR, how does that work?
[10:52:20] <RizziCR> u set as src the loading image (some load gif, ajaxloader image) and as data-original attribute the link to the generated image
[10:52:45] <stangeland> RizziCR, ok, so its not possible to set a bar going from 0 to 100 ?
[10:53:08] <RizziCR> oh.. i overread this.. sorry
[10:53:54] <RizziCR> if your server put out some progress information, u shurly build such a progress bar
[10:54:37] <RizziCR> but i think without such information its hard to build such a progress bar
[10:55:30] <RizziCR> u then have to estimate how long the image generating needs
[10:56:18] <RizziCR> so.. easyer is just show an loading animation without a progress state..
[12:40:25] <madprops> if i get the .height() on loading images, will i get the height of what has been loaded or will i get it's full height?

[14:45:04] <latemus> http://pastebin.com/7SMWC8LP If if want to use any of these variable i am setting within the success : { } object, then the code that will use them must be nested within that object, is that correct?
[14:46:02] <latemus> in other words, i cannot use variables defined in one .js file in another
[14:46:50] <latemus> if they are are assigned within jquery.ajax({}); ?
[14:47:31] <latemus> their scope is limited to within the .ajax function, right?
[14:48:04] <latemus> or to it's parent doc.ready() ?
[16:05:57] <cjohnson> yes latemus you can't access cpuPrice outside of success
[16:06:05] <cjohnson> unless you expose it explicitly in some way
[16:10:47] <reynierpm> if I have a JSON result like this {"natural_nombre":"Elvio Ramon","natural_apellido":"Chavez Gonzalez","natural_fecha_nacimiento":{"0":"1979-03-22T00:00:00.000-04:00"},"natural_sexo":{"0":"M"},"valid":true} how do I get the natural_sexo M value and the natural_fecha_nacimiento value?
[16:11:02] <reynierpm> this is inside a $.get().done callback
[16:11:17] <cjohnson> did you already parse it into an object with JSON.parse?
[16:11:27] <cjohnson> or by telling jQuery to do it by giving it dataType=json
[16:11:51] <reynierpm> chjohnson I just access them as $('#natural_nombre').prop('readonly', true).val(data.result.natural_nombre);
[16:12:12] <reynierpm> cjohnson but that ones is causing problems
[16:12:46] <reynierpm> cjohnson waits a minute let me check someting
[16:12:50] <cjohnson> console.log(data)
[16:13:03] <cjohnson> is it a JSON string or is it already parsed into an object?
[16:14:44] <reynierpm> is parsed as object
[16:15:00] <cjohnson> and you used console.log(data) to *verify* that?
[16:15:13] <reynierpm> console.log(data.result)
[16:15:16] <reynierpm> and yes
[16:15:19] <cjohnson> and what does that give you
[16:15:30] <cjohnson> can you screenshot it?
[16:15:37] <reynierpm> yep waits
[16:17:23] <reynierpm> here http://imgur.com/7Hf2wp4,w5ya87o
[16:17:27] <reynierpm> there are two images
[16:18:31] <cjohnson> data.result.natural_sexo.0 // M
[16:18:43] <reynierpm> let me try
[16:18:43] <cjohnson> why are you returning an object with 0 as the key though?
[16:18:53] <cjohnson> Make it return "natural_sexo": "M"
[16:18:58] <cjohnson> or
[16:19:06] <cjohnson> "natural_sexo": ["M"]
[16:19:09] <cjohnson> if you actually do want an array
[16:19:09] <reynierpm> well I do not I parse a XML from server side PHP and the XML comes as you see
[16:19:35] <cjohnson> I suspect you're doing some parsing wrong
[16:19:40] <cjohnson> if you're getting {"0":"M"}
[16:19:54] <cjohnson> where it seems you should be just getting "M"
[16:20:46] <cjohnson> reynierpm: I mean think of it this way. This record appears to be a person. do you think a person's sex is going to be an array? will a person have multiple sexes?
[16:20:58] <cjohnson> a person usually only has one sex
[16:22:05] <reynierpm> cjohnson you are right person can has only one sex or not (joke) but this is how the remote URL (REST Webservice) returns that data, I am parsing it using simple_xml_load from PHP
[16:22:13] <reynierpm> and data.result.natural_sexo.0 does not work
[16:22:30] <cjohnson> can you paste the XML for this record?
[16:22:54] <reynierpm> waits
[16:24:29] <cjohnson> oh and I was mistaken it would be .natural_sexo[0]  (because 0 is not a valid variable name)
[16:24:44] <cjohnson> but you should prob still fix the underlying data issue
[16:25:41] <reynierpm> cjohnson here http://pastie.org/9780756
[16:26:18] <cjohnson> see, sexo isn't an array here
[16:26:28] <cjohnson> something in your PHP is turning it into an object/array
[16:26:34] <reynierpm> cjohnson and this is how I am parsgin from PHP side
[16:26:35] <reynierpm> http://pastie.org/9780758
[16:27:39] <cjohnson> can you var_dump($naturalApellido); and var_dump($naturalSexo); on line 8 and see what that gives you?
[16:28:38] <reynierpm> $naturalApellido "Chavez Gonzalez"
[16:28:49] <reynierpm> $naturalSexo SimpleXMLElement {#2596 ▼   +"0": "M" }
[16:29:20] <reynierpm> and the same happens with $naturalFechaNacimiento SimpleXMLElement {#2666 ▼   +"0": "1979-03-22T00:00:00.000-04:00" }
[16:29:37] <reynierpm> for some reason gets converted to SimpleXmlElement
[16:30:18] <cjohnson> ok this is getting pretty offtopic but let's try one thing before we give up
[16:30:22] <cjohnson> var_dump($xmlObj->data_saime->sexo->child);
[16:30:25] <cjohnson> what's that give you?
[16:30:43] <reynierpm> yes I know
[16:31:05] <cjohnson> var_dump($xmlObj->data_saime->sexo->__toString());
[16:31:05] <cjohnson> I mean
[16:31:19] <reynierpm> SimpleXMLElement {#2674}
[16:31:33] <cjohnson> okay very last thing I'm gonna try
[16:31:43] <cjohnson> var_dump((string)$xmlObj->data_saime->sexo);
[16:31:45] <cjohnson> hehe
[16:32:02] <reynierpm> waits
[16:32:14] <reynierpm> $xmlObj->data_saime->sexo->__toString() this returns M
[16:32:21] <reynierpm> so is the right
[16:32:32] <reynierpm> the value I posted before was for the first try
[16:32:38] <reynierpm> let me see if that fixes the JS issue
[16:32:41] <reynierpm> waits
[16:32:56] <cjohnson> the (string) answer will probably also return M
[16:33:04] <cjohnson> I would use (string) instead of calling ->__toString() explicitly
[16:33:21] <reynierpm> you mean to a type cast?
[16:33:36] <cjohnson> yep. (string)$foo; is the same as $foo->__toString()  in PHP
[16:33:45] <reynierpm> (string) $xmlObj->data_saime->sexo
[16:33:46] <reynierpm> that?
[16:33:47] <cjohnson> yep
[16:33:48] <reynierpm> ah okey
[16:33:56] <reynierpm> waits give me a minute let me try
[16:34:24] <cjohnson> sure
[16:36:22] <reynierpm> cjohnson thanks it works
[16:37:59] <cjohnson> awesome!
[16:57:12] <P0rk> Hello, all. How do I check a radio button when it is clicked to see if it's selected and if it is already, select the last radio button in the group?
[17:05:40] <P0rk> is it terrible terrible to do $("#something").children().html(); to get the innerHTML of $("#something")?
[17:05:47] <cjohnson> if it's clicked, wouldn't it already be checked?
[17:05:59] <cjohnson> and if so the "select last button in group" would never happen
[17:06:03] <P0rk> That's the point. If you click it I want to select the "BLANK" option
[17:06:23] <cjohnson> so if I select option B, you want to prevent me from selecting option B
[17:06:30] <cjohnson> and instead select the blank option?
[17:06:45] <P0rk> If you click the currently selected radio button, unselect it and instead select the blank option
[17:06:54] <cjohnson> oooh, I see
[17:07:04] <P0rk> and then of course the blank option is hidden
[17:07:18] <P0rk> so it's kind of like a checkbox, but uses the radio button
[17:08:07] <cjohnson> .on('click', function() { if ($(this).prop('checked')) { $("input[name='"+ $(this).prop('name') +"']").last().prop('checked', true); } });
[17:08:10] <cjohnson> something like that
[17:08:30] <cjohnson> why not just... use checkboxes?
[17:08:35] <P0rk> beautiful...i couldn't wrap my head around the input selector
[17:09:26] <P0rk> I need only 1 form variable
[17:10:11] <P0rk> Well, it's more like 150....but five options for each.
[17:10:14] <cjohnson> you could also just uncheck the radio button
[17:10:17] <cjohnson> on click
[17:10:20] <cjohnson> if it's checked
[17:10:21] <P0rk> how?
[17:10:26] <cjohnson> .prop('checked', false)
[17:10:51] <P0rk> lemme see if that works.
[17:12:48] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/a6pu6L3d/
[17:13:41] <P0rk> I swear on a stack of bibles I was told you couldn't unselect a radio button.
[17:13:56] <P0rk> Thanks. I have spent at least 3 months fighting with thi
[17:17:57] <cjohnson> I'm not 100% sure it works everywhere. I seem to remember hearing or observing that same thing myself
[17:18:02] <cjohnson> I suspect some older IE won't let you
[17:18:04] <cjohnson> but screw IE :D
[17:18:06] <P0rk> $("input:radio").on("click",function(e) {console.log($(this).prop("checked"));}); always returns true
[17:18:34] <P0rk> how do I access the form variable identified by name?
[17:18:41] <P0rk> *form variable value
[17:18:45] <cjohnson> input[name=foo]
[17:18:48] <cjohnson> as selector
[17:19:09] <P0rk> don't know why I have such a barrier there. Can't get that through my head.
[17:19:11] <cjohnson> or :input[name=foo] if you need it to work with selects and textarea
[17:21:52] <P0rk> so, with radio  buttons, $("input[name="+$(this).prop("name")+"]').val() will tell me which radio button is selected on click, right?
[17:22:47] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Lcofndt8/79/
[17:22:58] <P0rk> so ignore the ugliness, just look at the last function.
[17:23:09] <cjohnson> no you just bind that method to all radio buttons
[17:23:13] <cjohnson> the .on that I gave
[17:23:29] <cjohnson> $('input:radio').on(... ^ code up there ^ ...)
[17:24:05] <cjohnson> when the given radio button is clicked, it says "if this radio is checked, find all radio buttons sharing its name, find the .last(), and check it"
[17:24:24] <P0rk> NOw, I don't need that if I can uncheck them
[17:24:31] <cjohnson> but I think the uncheck is better, just do $(this).prop('checked', false) inside the if statement instead
[17:24:45] <cjohnson> if ($(this).prop('checked')) { $(this).prop('checked', false); }
[17:24:55] <P0rk> always returns true on click
[17:25:01] <cjohnson> what returns true?
[17:25:04] <P0rk> $(this).prop("checked");
[17:25:10] <P0rk> always returns true
[17:26:14] <P0rk> $("input:radio").on('click',function(e) {console.log($(this).prop('checked'));});   will always return true
[17:26:42] <cjohnson> oooh right, that makes sense
[17:26:46] <cjohnson> when you click it, you check it
[17:26:55] <P0rk> So I think you have to compare the value of the radio button clicked with the value of the group to determine if it's the currently selected one to uncheck it
[17:27:02] <P0rk> that was a mouthful
[17:27:08] <cjohnson> no, not with the group
[17:27:29] <cjohnson> let's see...
[17:27:30] <P0rk> * all the same named elements
[17:27:42] <cjohnson> nope I don't think you need any other radio buttons to figure out how to uncheck
[17:28:18] <cjohnson> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4957207/how-to-check-uncheck-radio-button-on-click
[17:28:28] <cjohnson> browsers do weird things with radio buttons
[17:28:34] <cjohnson> so the solution is a little complicated
[17:29:26] <P0rk> hence back to my original idea
[17:29:30] <P0rk> rather than unchecking it
[17:29:44] <P0rk> I'll select the "hidden" value making it look unchecked
[17:29:47] <cjohnson> well, complicated once, not complicated to implement
[17:29:55] <cjohnson> I bet if you dump this code onto your page, everything will work neatly
[17:30:03] <cjohnson> the top answer
[17:30:13] <cjohnson> I think your original idea is, overall, more complicated
[17:30:56] <cjohnson> requires ongoing knowledge of your hidden radio button, and the backend will have to understand what it means, etc
[17:30:56] <P0rk> If it comes down to it, I won't have the uncheck option. THat is plain ugly.
[17:31:15] <cjohnson> what is ugly? unchecking radios?
[17:31:17] <cjohnson> I agree ;)
[17:31:37] <P0rk> no more than the backend would have to know what to do with unanswered questions
[17:33:27] <cjohnson> it should already be handling that case
[17:33:30] <cjohnson> this is a new special case
[17:33:40] <cjohnson> if you want to adapt this logic to other forms, you have to port the backend logic to each additional form
[17:33:49] <cjohnson> vs the uncheck solution which will just work
[17:34:07] <P0rk> How do I get the current value of a form element with radio button controls?
[17:34:57] <P0rk> Seriously. click it too fast and that solution sucks
[17:53:00] <P0rk> Much Much easier solution: http://jsfiddle.net/vo6yr9tu/10/
[17:55:59] <P0rk> aha. Even better. LOL http://jsfiddle.net/vo6yr9tu/11/
[18:01:39] <cjohnson> hah. that's terrible
[18:01:44] <cjohnson> seems to work tho
[18:03:20] <cjohnson> try it in different browsers though P0rk
[18:03:35] <cjohnson> the reason the solution was so complicated is because some browsers will re-order how the events fire for radio buttons
[18:03:44] <cjohnson> may not work everywhere
[18:04:01] <P0rk> But click doesn't care about all that.
[18:04:07] <P0rk> mouseup and down does
[18:04:57] <P0rk> you want click to fire last.
[18:08:40] <P0rk> LOL The more I look at the solution you provided, the more I am blown away that you prefer it. I hope I get to the point in my programming skills to understand why that's better.
[18:09:21] <P0rk> and your solution uses mouseout. Won't work on tablets
[18:13:38] <P0rk> on any device that doesn't fire mouseout (or if mouseout isn't fired because the cursor goes off the viewport), it leaves bindings on those individual radio buttons. This is a complete shambles of an answer.
[18:19:26] <cjohnson> I said I prefer a solution that does unchecking
[18:19:55] <cjohnson> to one that uses a hidden blank radio
[18:20:04] <cjohnson> as to the specific implementation, yours is roundabout and subject to side-effects from other code
[18:20:32] <cjohnson> I deal with bugs from side effects often enough to prefer code that isn't subject to them
[18:37:18] <spudzee> I need help with something
[18:37:32] <spudzee> making a jsfiddle now
[18:40:09] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/49Lc1ep5/ how can I make a click-drag style navigation system similar to google maps?
[18:50:38] <P0rk> spudzee, that's funny. the idea behind jsfiddle is to create a testbed where you can ask for help when you get stuck.
[18:51:07] <P0rk> Did you try Googling it? There are tons and tons of examples.
[18:51:21] <spudzee> I know, but it seems that whenever I ask a question on here, I always get a "make a jsfiddle". I couldn't find anything when I googled around
[18:51:26] <spudzee> could you link some
[18:52:39] <P0rk> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geometry-headings
[18:52:58] <P0rk> sample code and everything
[18:53:52] <P0rk> When folks ask you to make a fiddle, it's because they want to see your work to help you figure out where you went wrong.
[20:00:33] <latemus> is there a way to put multiple lines of code inside of a $("#id").html(' and the closing ');
[20:01:05] <latemus> if there is a return in-between the single quotes, the .html() fails
[20:01:58] <cjohnson> you can end the string with a ' +
[20:01:59] <latemus> the api docs fro .html say nothing about it. its a small thing but its making my code less readable
[20:02:02] <cjohnson> and continue it on next line
[20:02:08] <cjohnson> html('foo' +
[20:02:10] <cjohnson> 'bar')
[20:02:38] <cjohnson> you'll have to put in any \n that you want manually
[20:02:43] <cjohnson> with double quotes
[20:02:43] <latemus> cjohnson: THANK YOU
[20:02:52] <cjohnson> no prob
[20:07:52] <blackhajime> hello, someone from jquery ... i'm new in jquery .. i'm in problems ... here the parts http://dpaste.com/2V79Z5K
[20:23:08] <latemus> is it possible ot write a function like this http://pastebin.com/azmegypz so that whatever i pass in to the function (x) will be the name of the #id ? I guess I am really asking: can i place a value, x in this case, within the anonymous function's paranthesis and use that value within the function?
[20:24:02] <latemus> i want the value i place within the function(x) to become the name of the id in that example
[20:25:14] <all-liquid> this
[20:27:07] <LuciusSir> any idea why "     $(profSelect).trigger("change");
[20:27:07] <LuciusSir> "
[20:27:20] <LuciusSir> doesn't fire the event handler ?
[20:27:29] <cjohnson> latemus: check the docs for .on, they'll explain how your callback should be formed, as well as how to access the element the event triggered on
[20:27:43] <cjohnson> LuciusSir: console.log(profSelect.length); on the line above
[20:27:57] <latemus> cjohnson: thanks again
[20:28:16] <LuciusSir> it has two items
[20:28:20] <LuciusSir> thats not the point lol
[20:28:47] <cjohnson> well first we wanted to make sure your trigger is working
[20:29:05] <cjohnson> now put a console.log at the top of the event handler you're curious about
[20:29:32] <LuciusSir> oh dude i know what it should be doing
[20:29:37] <LuciusSir> it should be updating another dropdown
[20:29:51] <LuciusSir> it works when i do it via the browser
[20:29:54] <LuciusSir> just not in the script
[20:30:06] <cjohnson> "it works" is exactly what we're trying to define
[20:30:11] <cjohnson> you need to figure out where it's breaking
[20:30:24] <cjohnson> so for the handler on that other dropdown
[20:30:30] <LuciusSir> you think its breaking when i invoke it with .trigger() ?
[20:30:35] <cjohnson> put a console.log at the top of the handler to see when it's getting run
[20:30:51] <cjohnson> not sure, that's what we're trying to find out
[20:30:59] <cjohnson> maybe your binding is wrong
[20:31:19] <LuciusSir> ...shit
[20:31:21] <LuciusSir> it does run
[20:31:24] <cjohnson> ;)
[20:31:25] <LuciusSir> .....
[20:31:34] <LuciusSir> wth why is not working it pulls from a static object :(
[20:31:49] <cjohnson> so now you've eliminated .trigger and your binding so now it's the body of your event handler not behaving as you intended
[20:31:58] <cjohnson> you are now an expert debugger
[20:32:08] <cjohnson> repeat process
[20:35:08] <LuciusSir> i know how to debug :P I jsut figured if it worked it would work lol
[20:35:19] <LuciusSir> heres the issue, it does everything its supposed to
[20:35:27] <cjohnson> I hate when that happens
[20:35:49] <LuciusSir> it just doesn't append the element to the select like it should, even tho it does that when i manually click the select and fire th event that way
[20:35:55] <LuciusSir> but it hits the line
[20:35:56] <LuciusSir> lol
[20:36:00] <cjohnson> right so step through everything
[20:36:02] <cjohnson> I even gave you hints
[20:36:08] <LuciusSir> i diiiidddd
[20:36:09] <LuciusSir> lol
[20:36:14] <LuciusSir> thats my point
[20:36:17] <cjohnson> ensure the selector you're using to find the element to append to is returning something (check .length)
[20:36:23] <cjohnson> clearly not
[20:36:27] <cjohnson> or it would be working righ tnow
[20:36:29] <cjohnson> ;)
[20:36:42] <cjohnson> make sure what you're appending is what you expect it to be
[20:36:46] <cjohnson> all that good stuff
[20:37:28] <cjohnson> jsfiddle is always a good way to share your code
[20:41:21] <LuciusSir> cjohnson:  for whatever reason $(select-var) is returning an empty element which is why no options ar estarting
[20:41:22] <LuciusSir> question
[20:41:33] <LuciusSir> does the dom get updated AFTER the functionc all ends or during ?
[20:42:09] <LuciusSir> oh fuck i know what i did
[20:42:34] <LuciusSir> now it works.. grrr
[20:42:46] <cjohnson> hehe
[20:42:56] <cjohnson> ladies and gentlemen...debugging
[20:43:14] <cjohnson> DOM operations happen synchronously LuciusSir
[20:43:16] <LuciusSir> i add the completed row at the end of the function, so calling trigger(change) before that caused it to not update the current options which doesn't make sense in part because i can build the selects before its added to dom
[20:43:48] <cjohnson> aha
[20:43:48] <blackkbot> but you didn't build them before you are trying to grab them from the dom
[20:44:11] <LuciusSir> this is true, because one i referenced by var the other i referenced by ID !
[20:44:36] <LuciusSir> you a smart one :)
[20:44:46] <LuciusSir> i must study ab psych now so i don't fail my test tommorrow.. grr
[20:44:52] <LuciusSir> ty cjohnson :)
[20:44:56] <LuciusSir> and blackhajime
[20:45:00] <LuciusSir> blackbox*
[20:45:04] <blackkbot> close enough
[20:45:07] <blackkbot> heh
[20:45:37] <cjohnson> o/
[20:46:21] <LuciusSir> wow... you can get drunk by swishing around alcohol in your mouth and not swallowing
[20:46:23] <LuciusSir> heh
[20:46:34] <LuciusSir> i was trying to cure a toothache earlier and not drink
[20:47:05] <blackkbot> you can get drunk from inhailing alcohol
[20:47:14] <Uhkis> mouth is pretty good at absorbing stuff
[20:47:26] <blackkbot> you can absorb it through any mucus membranes
[21:08:39] <blackhajime> what this error means : "TypeError: $(...).validate is not a function" ?
[21:12:53] <slick-> hello, how do i check if a string is contained on the page
[21:13:01] <slick-> I'm sleep and failing hard at google this
[21:13:09] <slick-> sleepy
[21:23:20] <systemfault> Probably something like if ($('body').text().indexOf('something') !== -1)
[21:24:08] <snover> slick-: what are you actually trying to do?
[21:25:01] <Laban> Seems that my JQuery scripts are not working on html that has been outputted by jquery. Any common pit that I've fallen into?
[21:28:51] <slick-> done
[21:28:55] <slick-> thanks friends
[21:28:59] <slick-> ended up just using my brains
[22:06:50] <latemus> i have a function which calculates a value, and stores it in a variable. i want to make that one variable accessible to a sibling function. is this possible?
[22:07:26] <latemus> the sibling function will not work correctly if it is a child of the first function
[22:26:32] <cjohnson> return
[22:26:39] <cjohnson> is how you make functions give things to other functions
[22:27:21] <cjohnson> or the "this" keyword, if they're on the same object
[22:57:12] <latemus> cjohnson: thanks again man
[22:58:14] <cjohnson> :)
[23:10:00] <Ayub_> I have an issue with doing file upload with ajaxform..coudl some one assist me ?
[23:10:30] <Uhkis> probably
[23:11:34] <Ayub_> UhKis: when I use older version of the ajaxForm plugin success callback is always invoked
[23:11:52] <Ayub_> even when the actual file upload is a failure..
[23:13:16] <Ayub_> UhKis: I am using https://github.com/malsup/form for ajax form file upload
[23:17:58] <Ayub_> has anyone tried this plugin ?
[23:18:00] <Ayub_>  https://github.com/malsup/form
