[00:21:13] <buzzybron1> hi
[00:21:32] <buzzybron1> i have a problem with focus on an input element with ios
[00:21:42] <buzzybron1> when i do a focus, it does not scroll to the element
[00:21:48] <buzzybron1> how can i fix this
[00:27:08] <marcules> buzzybron1, the default behaviour on those devices is scroll-to-focus; did you somehow override onFocus on the input field?
[00:31:15] <sl33k> hi guys
[00:31:47] <buzzybron1> marcules: testing for that now
[00:31:49] <sl33k> please I need help understanding construction of date in jquery date picker: couldn't understand this line: minDate: new Date(1999, 10 - 1, 25),
[00:31:56] <sl33k> especially the 10-1 part
[00:32:54] <systemfault> sl33k: The -1 is because the Date object is retarded, months are 0-based
[00:33:35] <systemfault> So the guy wants october so it’s 10… but since months are zero-based in JS, he substracts 1 from it.
[00:34:01] <systemfault> You could write 9 if you wanted but the programmer left 10 - 1 to make it more obvious it’s because of Date that sucks
[00:35:59] <marcules> I wonder why days aren't 0-based
[00:37:05] <systemfault> marcules: Because the dudes at Sun decided that.
[00:37:15] <systemfault> back in ~1995
[00:38:46] <systemfault> (Yes… you read it well, the JS Date object was copied almost verbatim from Java 1.0)
[00:39:19] <marcules> ...
[00:39:20] <marcules> nice
[00:39:57] <sl33k> systemfault: ah! thanks
[00:40:07] <sl33k> thought it was some new syntax i didnt know about :D
[00:42:15] <sl33k> systemfault: also this says there are only four ways of creating date, http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp.  the option used in datePicker method above not included
[00:43:16] <systemfault> Use better references. w3schools sucks
[00:43:37] <systemfault> sl33k: With JS, if you want to know about X… then google for: MDN X
[00:43:45] <systemfault> So in your case… MDN Date
[00:44:05] <systemfault> You’ll find this page
[00:44:05] <systemfault> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[00:44:13] <systemfault> Look at the fourth constructor
[00:47:34] <sl33k> systemfault: thanks mate. should hang out here more often
[00:47:44] <systemfault> You’re welcome
[00:47:58] <marcules> http://www.w3fools.com/ @sl33k
[00:48:10] <marcules> It's really not a good source
[00:55:05] <w1z> What would be the best approach for copying multiple text boxes / anything in jQuery
[00:55:28] <Cork> w1z: what do you mean by copying?
[00:55:31] <Cork> cloning?
[00:55:45] <Cork> or you want to copy the values inside the form element
[00:55:48] <Cork> or..?
[00:55:53] <w1z> so I'm basically trying to copy a ton of elements from 1 object to another...
[00:55:59] <w1z> sorry my girlfriend is in my ear -_-
[00:56:01] <w1z> lol
[00:56:10] <w1z> Here...
[00:56:34] <w1z> cork, www.biztagram.com/memowotoru/memowotoru.html
[00:56:34] <Cork> w1z: hmm, better explain what you are trying to do
[00:56:46] <w1z> thats a basic idea but it's in javascript.
[00:57:05] <w1z> if you use it it will copy, but will copy too much.. I need more control.
[00:57:38] <Cork> ok so you want a set of form elements to what?
[00:57:43] <w1z> then again i don't have any control statements in it.
[00:57:44] <Cork> duplicate the form so you can enter it again?
[00:57:52] <Cork> you need to explain what you are trying to do
[00:58:10] <Cork> btw your html is invalid
[00:58:35] <w1z> It combines all the text boxes values into the textarea below.
[00:58:59] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biztagram.com%2Fmemowotoru%2Fmemowotoru.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:00:16] <w1z> right, i haven't validated the document in a long time.. sorry
[01:00:43] <Cork> well sure, i just posted that while waiting for something i can answer on
[01:00:52] <Cork> you still haven't answered the questions
[01:01:46] <w1z> Cork, ok, would it be easier to use jquery to process the text boxes into the text area? or would the script work fine?
[01:02:21] <Cork> w1z: you have a form with elements, you want to "copy" something about that form to something
[01:02:31] <Cork> the something needs to be specific not fluffy
[01:02:44] <Cork> cause depending on what you want to do the solution differs
[01:03:35] <w1z> Cork, it already works just fine, i just have issues when i add more elements, and some formatting issues.
[01:03:53] <w1z> Cork, let me formulate my problem and question a bit better than.
[01:03:57] <Cork> w1z: so by guessing freely i take it you might want to: take a form collect the values form the fields and add those <name>: <value>\n to the last textarea?
[01:05:18] <w1z> Cork, yes, but there are some issues with it, like it adding input boxes without really being filled out... so I guess I need to put some control statements... my other question is, would this be easier accomplished with jQuery or just plain JS?
[01:06:48] <Cork> w1z: btw jquery is missing from that page
[01:07:18] <w1z> its declared at the bottom
[01:11:35] <kuns> Hi, I am trying to find the closest div and show it, but only the closest. When I tried to use :first it only work the first time. http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/
[01:12:07] <kuns> How can I show the cloest div, only... and if I hover the next the next becomes visible and so on
[01:12:17] <kuns> It seem to stop after :first
[01:15:35] <Cork> w1z: http://jsfiddle.net/rb49u/
[01:16:52] <Cork> kuns: please include the html section needed for the code
[01:18:04] <kuns> Cork: give me a second then
[01:19:24] <joland9> does anyone know how to compare 2 arrays that look like this? array2 = [{"a": "XX"},{"a": "YY"}]];
[01:19:28] <joland9> array2 = [{"a": "XX"},{"a": "YY"}]];
[01:19:36] <flam_> what do you mean with comparing?
[01:19:45] <flam_> like are all keys and values of their objects the same?
[01:19:51] <joland9> yes
[01:19:52] <Cork> joland9: you would have to loop the arrays and compare the keys and values
[01:20:28] <joland9> yes like this: $.each( arr1, function( keya, valuea ) {
[01:20:28] <joland9>     $.each( arr2, function( keyb, valueb ) {
[01:21:18] <Cork> yup
[01:22:19] <kuns> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/1/ hovering the gray box should show the black box
[01:24:15] <joland9> i tried this http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/ but that doesnt work
[01:24:17] <Cork> kuns: http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/2/
[01:26:46] <kuns> hm Cork
[01:26:53] <kuns> what if the difference between first() and :first?
[01:27:18] <Cork> kuns: :first is called through sizzle that then calls back into jquery to call .first()
[01:27:31] <Cork> so basically more code to do the same thing
[01:27:57] <kuns> Oh okay
[01:28:45] <Cork> joland9: http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/1/
[01:29:15] <Cork> hmm this can be optimized btw...
[01:29:39] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/2/
[01:31:09] <Cork> opps forgot the objects
[01:31:23] <marcules> Cork, why did you leave same in the loop?
[01:31:45] <Cork> marcules: the script is wrong
[01:32:05] <Cork> marcules: but but same is needed to be used to detect if the arrays differ
[01:32:20] <flam_> joland9, http://pastebin.com/D95WPpdN maybe something like that (using, underscore.js) i didn't test that though
[01:32:51] <joland9> Cork: i got in the console.log “Error!: arrays differ” but both arrays are the same...
[01:32:52] <marcules> Cork, if you return right after setting it, there is no point in setting it
[01:32:56] <flam_> uhm, and obj1.isEqual(obj2) should be _.isEqual(obj1,obj2)
[01:33:05] <Cork> marcules: sure it is
[01:33:12] <Cork> the variable is used in the function
[01:33:18] <meteorNewbie> * testing if I can chat unregistered *
[01:34:23] <Cork> leave that code for now
[01:34:29] <Cork> it is far from what i indended
[01:34:31] <marcules> Oh I see you're just leaving the function
[01:34:33] <Cork> i will post a fixed version soon
[01:35:24] <joland9> flam_: using underscore.js,  i prefer not to load more plugins/libs  jquery …should be… able to do the trick
[01:35:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/3/
[01:35:56] <Cork> there a fixed version
[01:36:02] <marcules> joland9, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7837456/comparing-two-arrays-in-javascript < why not use this implementation?
[01:36:11] <flam_> it's not a plugin but a cool library
[01:36:56] <meteorNewbie> Hi all! I would love if someone could help me refactor this to something elegant (just a small but ugly code snippet). http://liveweave.com/41M4fS
[01:37:47] <Cork> joland9: what browser support do you need btw?
[01:37:58] <Cork> is ie9 ok?
[01:38:20] <joland9> marcules: i have been discussing with some other programmer the difference between [1,2,3] and [{"a": "XX”}]
[01:38:40] <buzzybron1> i have a problem with focus on an input element with ios
[01:38:43] <joland9> marcules: it’s simply not the same
[01:38:44] <marcules> Well the first is an array of primitives and the second an array of dicts
[01:38:53] <sacho_> $s?$v?
[01:38:54] <buzzybron1> when i do a focus, it does not scroll to the element
[01:39:01] <buzzybron1> how can i fix this
[01:39:05] <Cork> joland9: the reason is that you can't objects
[01:39:07] <joland9> cork: i tested it and it works beautifully
[01:39:16] <Cork> joland9: if you do obj1 == obj2
[01:39:19] <marcules> joland9, if you scroll further down the answer he's describing comparing dicts
[01:39:26] <Cork> i just checks if the object is the exact same object
[01:39:29] <buzzybron1> when i perform a remove instead of focus, it's removing, but when i am doing a focus on the element, nothing happens on ios
[01:39:44] <meteorNewbie> sacho_ they are special functions for setting variables (or page items as they are called in Oracle Apex)
[01:40:02] <Cork> joland9: that scripts fail if array2's object has keys missing in array1's object
[01:40:16] <meteorNewbie> sacho_: they are special functions for setting variables (or page items as they are called in Oracle Apex) (or rather setting and getting)
[01:40:18] <sacho_> meteorNewbie, how do you want us to refactor code that's not working
[01:40:36] <joland9> cork: meaning that if array1 has 2 and array2 has 3 elements???
[01:41:01] <meteorNewbie> sacho_: ok, sorry. I'll try to clean it up. Didn't think it would mattar too much.
[01:41:08] <Cork> joland9: sameArrays([{ a: 1, b: 2, c:3 }], [{ a: 1, b: 2, c:3, d: 4 }]) == true
[01:41:26] <joland9> ohhh :/
[01:41:45] <joland9> thats not what i was looking for
[01:42:08] <Cork> joland9: this fixes that http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/4/
[01:42:12] <Cork> but it only works in ie9 and up
[01:42:38] <marcules> joland9, the answer's in the link above - first layer is to compare/iterate arrays, second layer is to compare the dicts in the arrays - both is described there
[01:42:52] <Cork> and loop optimizing
[01:42:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/5/
[01:43:28] <Cork> and a typo fix http://jsfiddle.net/RLFKx/6/
[01:44:16] <kuns> I tried to learn about the prevAll and nextAll functions Cork tried to teach me but I guess I failed. http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/4/
[01:44:24] <kuns> the var entry remains null
[01:44:28] <kuns> I guess am missing something
[01:44:52] <Cork> kuns: http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/5/
[01:45:16] <kuns> aah, I see
[01:45:20] <kuns> you have to select the parent
[01:45:22] <Cork> kuns: closest searches parents, prev and next searches siblings
[01:50:29] <joland9> cork: so you say it won’t work on ie8 ? (i have no idea how many still uses those)
[01:50:55] <Cork> joland9: yes i uses Object.keys and that is > ie8
[01:51:23] <kuns> yet var entry seems to have the value "null", hmm...
[01:51:25] <Cork> joland9: and if you can't use Object.keys you would have to loop and count the keys in the object
[01:51:30] <kuns> can I see what element it grabbed somehow?
[01:51:58] <Cork> kuns: sure console.log(entry)
[01:52:10] <Cork> or console.log($(this).closest('td')
[01:52:18] <Cork> )
[01:53:23] <kuns> I have to grab the tr parent it seems
[01:53:49] <Cork> not if the html you had is correct
[01:55:25] <Cork> ah right
[01:55:40] <Cork> you sorry the td doesn't have the class...
[01:56:12] <Cork> kuns: http://jsfiddle.net/et73B/8/
[01:58:02] <kuns> Cork: yeah :)
[01:58:22] <joland9> Cork: IE 7-8 doesnt support much http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/
[01:58:31] <Cork> joland9: i know
[01:58:48] <joland9> Cork: i wonder about mobile browsers tho
[01:59:25] <Cork> joland9: browsers other then ie has supported object.keys for quite some time
[01:59:35] <Cork> so the mobile versions should support it just fine
[01:59:41] <Cork> though i haven't tested it my self
[02:00:30] <joland9> Cork: than i should be in the clear, this thing is for checking permissions during a fb login
[02:00:44] <Cork> O_o
[02:00:59] <Cork> joland9: permissions should be controlled server side, not client side
[02:01:24] <joland9> Cork: currently most used browsers: http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php
[02:01:50] <Cork> joland9: it isn't that simple to answer
[02:02:09] <joland9> Cork: meaning?
[02:02:09] <Cork> the stats fail quite a bit
[02:02:27] <Cork> so you shouldn't take them as more then just a very wide general direction
[02:02:36] <joland9> Cork: true, but if you compare with others.. than you might have a general idea
[02:02:41] <Cork> if you need more correct stats you should log your own site
[02:03:03] <joland9> thats for sure
[02:03:10] <Cork> joland9: no, cause those stats is based on users that allow those tracking js files
[02:03:16] <Cork> and many block those
[02:03:23] <joland9> me included :)
[02:03:57] <joland9> you simply can take the risk anymore
[02:04:02] <joland9> cant
[02:04:22] <Cork> joland9: what you could do is add a shim for ie < 9
[02:04:32] <Cork> that implements Object.keys
[02:04:50] <Cork> but again, you should do permission handling server side, not in js
[02:05:14] <Cork> js is not a secure environment, so checks there can be faked quite easily
[02:05:20] <joland9> well, that how the api of facebook works
[02:05:47] <joland9> auth2.0 they call it?
[02:06:13] <Cork> haven't looked into it
[02:06:23] <joland9> for what i heard, a less insecure way that the previous auth1.0
[02:06:26] <Cork> but it sounds like that api should be used server side
[02:06:28] <Cork> and not in the page
[02:06:53] <joland9> they offer php but also javascript api
[02:07:07] <Cork> joland9: of if you mean the array is a list of things you're allowed to do
[02:07:18] <joland9> security in facebook is a joke anyway :)
[02:07:21] <Cork> and not something saying if the it should be allowed
[02:07:27] <Cork> that would be a totally different thing
[02:07:32] <Cork> joland9: i know
[02:07:46] <Cork> that is one of the reasons i don't have an account
[02:08:02] <Cork> and forbid ppl to have me in there facebook account
[02:08:53] <joland9> yes i do very like with Soc. Network also
[02:09:06] <joland9> but thats probably the most of us… programmers
[02:09:29] <joland9> only the dumbass post their whole life stories online
[02:09:32] <joland9> anyways
[02:09:58] <joland9> in order to get the permissions you have to make a call to the FB.api
[02:10:01] <joland9> FB.api('me/permissions', function(response) {
[02:11:01] <marcules> Why do you want to check locally again if the user has said permissions? To (visually) disable some text fields?
[02:11:03] <joland9> the way they work with to exchange an accessToken
[02:11:41] <joland9> they can change permission any time later..
[02:12:05] <joland9> and to work with the app, certain permissions are needed
[02:12:45] <joland9> users can revoke 1 or more permissions per app
[02:13:06] <joland9> even if they have accepted them at initial stage
[02:15:16] <joland9> Cork: as for the < IE 9, dont bother… those ancient browsers wont probably work with lots of other features anyways
[02:15:26] <Cork> true
[02:15:55] <Cork> i usually don't support ie< 9 anymore either (since win xp died)
[02:17:22] <joland9> Cork: i wonder what type of ppl still uses IE 8, and if they do serious internet banking on them :)
[02:17:35] <IRConan> lots do I expect
[02:17:54] <Cork> joland9: mostly ppl blocked to update from corporation it
[02:18:04] <Cork> and ppl that just don't run updates at all
[02:18:21] <Cork> (aka. pirated windows xp users)
[02:18:25] <joland9> right@
[02:18:38] <dbt_> I've worked on a number of banking sites and they have to support legacy browsers
[02:19:08] <dbt_> legal compliance along with outdated infrastructure
[02:19:16] <Cork> dbt_: my experience is rather the opposite
[02:19:25] <Cork> banks normally only support legacy browsers
[02:19:50] <Cork> if you have problem with there site, the number one thing they request is that you use ie
[02:19:56] <Cork> and normally ie < 10
[02:19:59] <joland9> here there are local governments that pay microsoft..cos upgrade intime… so they pay for personal patches
[02:21:06] <joland9> Cork: isnt that the old days?
[02:21:32] <Cork> joland9: nope, that is still today
[02:21:49] <joland9> from all browsers i think IE is the unsafest (depending on the user ofcourse)
[02:22:10] <joland9> where is that? Romania?
[02:22:38] <Cork> joland9: sweden
[02:22:47] <dbt_> I was recently working on a banking site specifically aimed at offshore banking for the very wealthy to save on tax etc, most of my time was making it work in IE6. Not got any good stats on the number of millionaires who run IE6
[02:23:06] <joland9> hmmm i consider Sweden pretty uptodate
[02:23:07] <dbt_> but the bank isisted that was the baseline
[02:23:10] <Cork> they haven't heard that news that most users don't use ie anymore...
[02:23:15] <Cork> joland9: it is
[02:23:21] <Cork> except for bank supports
[02:23:56] <joland9> IE6…. you gotta be kidding
[02:23:56] <marcules> dbt_, 5.5 and 6 are shit requirements, I feel sorry for you
[02:23:58] <Cork> dbt_: ouch that sucks
[02:24:11] <Cork> marcules: 5.5 is much much worst then ie6
[02:24:16] <buzzybron1> within jquery how can i call the select body object?
[02:24:27] <dbt_> $('body')
[02:24:35] <Cork> or $(document.body)
[02:24:56] <marcules> Nah, I had one project where we had to support 5.5+6, and the difference was not really that big (but there wasn't much fancy stuff either) - most problems in 5.5 were with CSS interpretation on my end
[02:25:31] <Cork> marcules: ie5.5 is much worse when it comes to click events and z-index
[02:25:53] <Cork> as click only works on <a> tags (so no click on <span> and so on)
[02:25:55] <dbt_> not had to support 5.5 for a good while thankfully
[02:26:05] <Cork> same here
[02:26:28] <Cork> 5.5 was... 4-5 years ago
[02:27:03] <joland9> 5.5 is that Windows 98?
[02:27:11] <Cork> no
[02:27:16] <joland9> :)
[02:27:18] <Cork> window 2k win me and so on
[02:27:26] <joland9> windows 95?
[02:27:34] <Cork> 98 didn't get anything after 5 if i remmeber correctly
[02:27:40] <Cork> joland9: heh nooo
[02:27:42] <marcules> position:relative everywhere for 5.5 :D
[02:28:03] <Cork> marcules: ya, and position: absolute is ~ position: fixed... >_<
[02:28:08] <marcules> yup
[02:28:08] <joland9> the good old days of Netscape
[02:28:09] <marcules> ^^
[02:28:51] <marcules> actually getting absolute to work is a pain - zoom: 1 for everyone
[02:28:55] <marcules> Fucking hasLayout
[02:29:01] <Cork> ya
[02:29:08] <dbt_> oh yeh
[02:30:05] <marcules> My job description in that project was "dojo development" - ended up being "the IE CSS guy"
[02:30:19] <Cork> lol ouch
[02:50:31] <callumacrae> Is there a way to always add something to the end of a URL of an AJAX request without writing a wrapper function for $.ajax?
[02:51:17] <callumacrae> So I can write $.get('/blabla') and it'll GET /blabla?user_token=something
[02:51:48] <Jattenalle> callumacrae, no, wrapper it is
[02:51:58] <arthurvr> Maybe u can do that by overwriting jQuery.get?
[02:52:26] <callumacrae> Definitely don't want to override $.get, could be dangerous
[02:52:34] <callumacrae> It'll stick with a wrapper function for now
[02:53:43] <flam_> i'm thinking of something similar: is there a way to automatically add csrfToken: <some var> to all POST/PUT/DELETE ajax requests parameters
[02:54:28] <callumacrae> The solution to that would be the same as the solution to my problem
[02:54:36] <flam_> yeah, pretty much
[02:54:45] <callumacrae> Looks like a wrapper function is the best option though
[02:55:24] <joland9> do you guys comment console.log on production pages or do you keep them “logging”?
[02:55:45] <callumacrae> If you're using console.log on a production page, you're doing it wrong
[02:57:17] <joland9> nope, i am working locally but i wonder if you comment all the console.logs when the pages are going online
[02:57:33] <callumacrae> Why do you have console.logs in your application?
[02:58:27] <joland9> you wont see them unless you turn on firebug or such
[02:59:22] <callumacrae> console isn't defined in IE8, and so any code with console.log in won't work in IE8
[02:59:32] <callumacrae> Again, why do you have console.log in your code? It's not a good way to debug stuff
[03:00:20] <arthurvr> callumacrae: just make sure including this script: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/js/plugins.js
[03:00:29] <arthurvr> Then it isnt breaking in ie8
[03:00:47] <callumacrae> Why would you do that? Just don't use console.log in production code, if at all
[03:01:06] <joland9> callumacrae: not sure if you know what i mean
[03:01:12] <callumacrae> Y'all need to discover the debugger
[03:02:04] <joland9> callumacrae: what do you mean?
[03:02:12] <joland9> firebug?
[03:02:15] <callumacrae> .-.
[03:02:22] <arthurvr> Notice if you're using grunt you can use this to strip all console.log statements out of you code: https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-strip-debug
[03:02:24] <callumacrae> What are you actually using console.log for? Looking at variables?
[03:02:47] <joland9> debug
[03:03:22] <callumacrae> Yeah, use the debugger
[03:03:27] <callumacrae> Dunno how to do it in Firebug
[03:03:36] <callumacrae> But the debugger is *way* better than putting console.log everywhere
[03:03:52] <callumacrae> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_G2kHiqU60 possibly
[03:05:35] <callumacrae> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6006340/how-to-set-breakpoints-using-firebug
[03:05:37] <joland9> funny… the YT link you just posted is about Firebug
[03:05:51] <callumacrae> Yes, why would I link you to Chrome DevTool docs? lol
[03:06:33] <joland9> ur own prev. statement: “callumacrae: Dunno how to do it in Firebug”
[03:07:00] <callumacrae> And I still don't, I haven't watched the video :-)
[03:07:12] <joland9> :/
[03:07:24] <callumacrae> Next time you want to use console.log, just write "debugger;" instead, and magic will happen
[03:12:47] <EdwardIII> hey, is it possible to make jQuery validate trigger on a selectbox's change, and not on click? preferably for a single rule, but could do it for the whole validator i guess
[03:13:49] <dbt_> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[03:15:33] <EdwardIII> ok i've hooked it up manually with $('select').change($('form').valid()); but it seems to trigger when the dropdown is clicked, not just when the select value changes
[03:17:00] <minato> i have a problem in jquery mobile app using phonegap ,please help me. i have created a form <form method="post" action="http:://script address.php" data-ajax=false> the form submits properly.and i see output from php page, but how do i go back? if i give anchor url to index.html it will search for index.html on website not the index.html in the app to which i want to be navigated.
[03:18:56] <arthurvr> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/2WGaz/1/
[03:19:02] <EdwardIII> ah, jquery validate has it's own click event that needs disabling
[03:19:03] <EdwardIII> job done
[03:22:48] <arthurvr> minato: use ajax for your form. Doing it that way is simply submitting the data and redicting to that page. You could get the return value from that page page with ajax, and then load it into your page.
[03:23:49] <minato> ok,so i have to learn form submission using ajax right?do you of any resources?
[03:25:10] <arthurvr> It isnt really 'learning', it's super easy. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:26:06] <joland9> callumacrae: magic? i guess ur reffering to the FF debugger, what a bummer
[03:26:39] <minato> arthurvr: yea i got it. thanks :)
[03:27:06] <callumacrae> Dunno, I use Chrome
[03:28:32] <joland9> same, default debugger
[03:31:51] <minato> arthurvr: http://pastebin.com/fQTRU9Ag  any improvements to this?
[03:33:17] <systemfault> minato: Never use .click to handle form submission, use the “submit” event of the form element
[03:33:33] <arthurvr> minato: http://pastebin.com/vByF2dNE
[03:34:11] <arthurvr> Use 'submit' event, e.preventDefault and you forgot to include data
[03:34:22] <systemfault> arthurvr: missing t on line  13 :P
[03:34:27] <systemfault> (it happens)
[03:34:32] <arthurvr> oops
[03:34:35] <arthurvr> :-)
[03:37:14] <minato> working thank you guys :)
[03:47:26] <ryorky1> was wondering if someone could take a quick look at the javascript/css3 menu I created.  It works great when the screen is maximised, but when it is minimised to the mobile size, it breaks, i.e. the mobile menu doesn't work as it should.  The problem appears to be with the divs that I have inserted in the <nav> tags when I add them, the web version works properly, but the mobile version is broken and vice versa.  Here is a gist of it w
[03:47:26] <ryorky1> hen the mobile version isn't working:  http://jsfiddle.net/8WA5B/
[03:47:58] <momo_> Hi, I need help concerning the dialogbox
[03:48:09] <momo_> Is someone free to help me out please
[03:49:50] <momo_> DialogBox, not working for modal.  The latter is also set as modal!
[03:50:19] <ryorky1> momo_:  post a jsfiddle example
[03:50:32] <ryorky1> or rather a link to a jsfiddle
[03:50:43] <arthurvr> jsfiddle / jsbin would be handy indeed
[03:51:55] <ryorky1> <arthurvr>:  any idea what might be breaking in my fiddle:   http://jsfiddle.net/8WA5B/ when the screen size gets to the mobile size?
[03:52:29] <ryorky1> arthurvr:  ^^
[04:07:50] <supreme__> Hi, Iam doing a jsonp request to my backend, which is on another port. but I get parseerror all the time even tho it's correct on the backend.
[04:07:56] <supreme__> Any ideas?
[04:13:34] <arthurvr> What method? $.getJSON? If you're using $.ajax, make sure that dataType is specified as 'jsonp'
[04:14:01] <kuns> I'm trying to get the amount of table rows in a table, var trcount = $('.result tr').size();
[04:14:07] <kuns> however, it returns the double amount.
[04:14:14] <kuns> does it count both <tr> and </tr> ?
[04:14:32] <arthurvr> kuns: why .size? Use .length wil work
[04:14:38] <kuns> I tried that
[04:14:40] <kuns> same result
[04:15:42] <Cork> kuns: don't use .size() it is deprecated
[04:15:44] <Cork> use .length
[04:16:38] <Cork> and all it does is size: function() { this.length })
[04:16:48] <arthurvr> kuns: http://jsfiddle.net/C8BtM/
[04:18:33] <arthurvr> Indeed dont need .size: it's a shortcut for length... http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.size
[04:20:01] <Cork> and http://api.jquery.com/size/
[04:20:09] <Cork> "version deprecated: 1.8"
[04:21:58] <qwe321> Hi.Could someone explain me what is the difference between $(".class").animate(prop, duration).animate(other prop, duration) and $(".class").animate(prop, duration, function(){ $(".class").animate(prop, duration)}) ? Thank you
[04:22:19] <Cork> qwe321: very little
[04:22:31] <Cork> qwe321: functions that animate queue by default
[04:22:52] <Cork> the callbacks is needed if you want to do something like .text('done!')
[04:24:00] <wfq> Hi guys
[04:24:35] <qwe321> so I guess the preferred way is to chain .animate.animate if I don't need to modify some other object on callback
[04:25:33] <Cork> qwe321: exactly
[04:25:35] <wfq> I have inherited a code that is using jquery.validate. The problem I am having is that I need to do some further validation after the button of the form has been clicked. Is there anyway to call the submit event manually? For example add an onclick event to the submit button and then from within the onclick call the submit event
[04:25:48] <qwe321> Thank you @Cork
[04:25:52] <Cork> np
[04:26:26] <arthurvr> wfq: $('form').trigger('submit')
[04:26:43] <Cork> wfq: you can add custom validators to jquery.validate
[04:26:52] <Cork> it is prob the better approach
[04:27:40] <wfq> arthurvr thanks. Cork could you please point me out any good doc relating this issue? Can I actually add custom validation on onclick events with Jquery.validate?
[04:28:12] <Cork> wfq: http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[04:28:27] <wfq> was actually looking at that page
[04:32:39] <wfq> I can guess I am looking for something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7445423/validate-a-form-on-click-event-with-validator-jquery
[04:40:08] <meteorNewbie> Right!
[04:40:09] <meteorNewbie> After cleaning up my example I call upon the gods of jQuery/JS to help me refactor this code snippet into a thing of beauty. http://liveweave.com/Rfcxsj
[04:40:34] <meteorNewbie> sacho_: You like? :)
[04:48:48] <meteorNewbie> Removed superfluous jQuery UI lib and css: http://liveweave.com/ZbdPew
[05:27:47] <meteorNewbie> Wow, this place died...
[05:27:58] <systemfault> oh really?
[05:28:08] <meteorNewbie> oh, life! :)
[05:28:54] <meteorNewbie> No one wanna take a crack at my code challenge? :)
[05:34:25] <meteorNewbie> It took a good hour or two to beat this uglie into submission so I'd really appreciate any thoughts.
[05:36:23] <systemfault> I don’t feel like doing a challenge...
[05:36:31] <systemfault> If you want to show us your code, go ahead.
[05:36:54] <jcool> I am able to delete and add row of tables on runtime
[05:37:08] <jcool> however if the row being deleted is last row then I dont want to delete it
[05:37:14] <jcool> how can I achieve same?
[05:37:52] <systemfault> jcool: Just check the number of row before? If that number is 1… don’t delete
[05:38:16] <jcool> systemfault, right now its like this
[05:38:16] <jcool>  $('#mytable tbody>tr:last').last().remove('#mytable tbody>tr:last');
[05:38:41] <systemfault> o_O
[05:39:08] <jcool> :o
[05:39:19] <arthurvr> You're doing :last 3 times?
[05:39:30] <systemfault> arthurvr: he REALLY wants it to be the last!
[05:39:45] <arthurvr> one is enough :-)
[05:40:09] <jcool> new row is addded at last and similary deletion is done on last row added in table
[05:41:24] <meteorNewbie> If you know a little more JS than I do this will probably be a breeze for you: same link as before http://liveweave.com/ZbdPew
[05:41:45] <systemfault> jcool: var myTable = $('#mytable'); if (myTable.find('tr').length > 1) { myTable.find('tr:last-child').remove(); } //something similar
[05:42:04] <jcool> systemfault, got that ;)
[05:42:46] <systemfault> meteorNewbie: So, what's the idea?
[05:43:58] <meteorNewbie> Try it out and you'll see. I have to work within the confines of the functionality but I get the feeling there is a much more elegant way to solve this.
[05:45:07] <jcool> $('#mytable tbody').closest('tr').is('tr:only-child') ?
[05:45:11] <jcool> something like this?
[05:45:15] <meteorNewbie> Like what if I could store my elements in an array and just loop through all the elements instead of testing them one by one.
[05:46:56] <meteorNewbie> Or I would be a little happier if I could just apply switch case on this scenario but I don't see how that would be possible.
[05:47:35] <meteorNewbie> Well, there is an ugly way but...
[05:47:41] <systemfault> meteorNewbie: I'll try something.
[05:48:04] <meteorNewbie> Cool :-)
[05:51:09] <systemfault> meteorNewbie: A test: http://jsfiddle.net/wk8s9/
[05:52:18] <arthurvr> http://liveweave.com/fU6V1v
[05:52:35] <meteorNewbie> systemfault:I like what I see at a quick look. I'll test if this works. Thanks!
[05:53:27] <meteorNewbie> arthurvr: Thanks, I'll study this one too!
[05:53:39] <arthurvr> check out this one, its a little shorter http://liveweave.com/VwtOxm
[05:54:00] <meteorNewbie> arthurvr: Sweet :)
[05:56:07] <arthurvr> meteorNewbie: shorter again: http://liveweave.com/s1aF6Q
[05:56:55] <meteorNewbie> arthurvr: hehe
[05:57:44] <arthurvr> meteorNewbie: better selectors http://liveweave.com/Y5zPRq
[05:59:25] <arthurvr> meteorNewbie: think this is final version http://liveweave.com/1DEfKx
[05:59:38] <systemfault> lol
[05:59:42] <systemfault> Is it a code golf?

[06:03:07] <sl33k1> hi guys
[06:03:18] <sl33k1> working on some ajax thingy...
[06:04:18] <systemfault> Lucky!
[06:04:20] <sl33k1> I have Region, Branch, And User...i want Branches to be loaded on Region, and Users to be loaded on Branch change....R, B & A are all drop down select options
[06:04:25] <sl33k1> please i need guidance
[06:04:58] <sl33k1> currently i have B changing on R chaneg event through Ajax, ditto for B & A*(userAccount too)
[06:05:15] <arthurvr> sl33k1: jsfiddle would help?
[06:05:16] <sl33k1> problem is when Region changes, branch changes too, but user account doesnt change
[06:05:44] <sl33k1> wondering if i should bind region change even to call useraccount load too
[06:08:30] <sl33k1> solving this by tyeing dependency on success completions
[06:09:05] <hackal> hello is there a way to target element according to its attribute value?
[06:10:30] <systemfault> hackal: Yes.
[06:12:02] <arthurvr> hackal: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[06:12:05] <hackal> I have custom attribute "for" in some elements. How could I target them. for example <label for="test">
[06:12:27] <systemfault> hackal: $('label[for="test"]')
[06:12:41] <hackal> alright thank you very much for help
[06:13:59] <antlong> what exactly would setInterval, x, 1000 / 60 do? specifically the 1000 / 60?
[06:15:16] <Cork> antlong: frames per second?
[06:15:27] <Cork> if it is, that would be a really bad idea
[06:15:51] <antlong> Cork onUpdate() does 3 updates
[06:16:02] <antlong> is that diving 1000 by 6 though?
[06:16:12] <antlong> 60*
[06:16:18] <Cork> 1s == 1000 ms
[06:16:28] <Cork> a cycle on a screen os 60
[06:16:32] <Cork> so 1000 / 60
[06:16:38] <Cork> os==is
[06:16:53] <antlong> so once save per minute?
[06:16:56] <Cork> no
[06:17:05] <Cork> one update per frame the screen can draw
[06:17:10] <antlong> wtf
[06:17:12] <Cork> but it won't
[06:17:22] <antlong> whats a reasonable figure for that to be?
[06:17:33] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame
[06:17:57] <Cork> ?g requestAnimationFrame
[06:17:58] <b-ot> Cork: window.requestAnimationFrame() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[06:18:26] <Cork> setInterval is a really bad idea for this too
[06:18:42] <Cork> cause if say the computer becomes busy
[06:18:54] <Cork> so the execution of the function callbacks takes more then 16.6 ms
[06:19:03] <antlong> Cork https://github.com/antlong/multiverseminer/blob/master/src/main.js#L50
[06:19:07] <Cork> you will start queuing more then one call
[06:19:17] <Cork> so after a while you run constantly
[06:19:47] <arthurvr> indeed, really bad for performance and slow computers will crash
[06:20:06] <Cork> Anticom: use requestAnimationFrame with a fallback to setTimeout
[06:20:16] <Cork> and use Date to get the diff from the two calls
[06:20:24] <Cork> and from that diff find what frame you should draw
[06:20:34] <antlong> Cork so this is what i want? https://gist.github.com/joelambert/1002116#file-requestanimframe-js-L3
[06:21:01] <Cork> Anticom: no, it use window.setInterval
[06:21:05] <Cork> (line 12)
[06:21:20] <Cork> you never ever ever want to use setInterval for things like this
[06:22:47] <antlong> I'm a little confused
[06:22:56] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[06:22:58] <antlong> im replacing my function with the one you suggested?
[06:23:04] <Cork> antlong: heres a better example http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/
[06:23:42] <Anticom> Cork you'r polling the wrong one :D
[06:23:50] <Anticom> howdy btw
[06:23:53] <Cork> Anticom: ya, i noticed that
[06:23:54] <Cork> sorry
[06:23:56] <Anticom> haha np
[06:24:26] <Cork> and o/
[06:24:45] <antlong> so then i just add my onUpdate() right under that render()?
[06:25:41] <Cork> antlong: no, instead of
[06:25:48] <antlong> oh ok
[06:26:00] <Cork> antlong: though the requestAnimateFrame should be last not first
[06:26:09] <Cork> but that doesn't matter much
[06:26:14] <Cork> as js is single threaded
[06:26:52] <antlong> and i don't change anything in the top fundction?
[06:26:59] <antlong> the window.req one
[06:27:03] <Cork> nope
[06:27:10] <Cork> that is how it should look
[06:27:26] <Cork> its a shim that makes sure window.requestAnimationFrame exist in all browsers
[06:27:38] <Cork> removes prefixes if an unprefixed doesn't exist
[06:27:52] <Cork> or create one based on setTimeout if not supported
[06:28:33] <joland9> Cork: with code you gave me i am still getting the wrong err var http://liveweave.com/EAgRp8
[06:28:59] <Cork> antlong: actually you could change one thing in the top function if you like
[06:29:27] <antlong> what would that be?
[06:29:43] <Cork> window.setTimeout(function() { callback(new Date().getTime()); }, 1000 / 60)
[06:30:10] <Cork> and (function animloop(timestamp)
[06:30:25] <Cork> you then store the old timestamp
[06:30:28] <joland9> Cork: according to the test the result should be; err = 0
[06:30:32] <Cork> and compare that to the new timestamp
[06:30:42] <Cork> get how many frames you should skip
[06:31:11] <Cork> joland9: sorry, can't look at it now, i need to go
[06:31:51] <joland9> anyone who knows why err = 1 instead of 0?  http://liveweave.com/EAgRp8
[06:34:42] <meteorNewbie> Okay! I had a good look at both examples and they are great but I realize I made a mistake in explaining my restrictions. The checkbox id is must not be the same as the state id. I applied this to systemfaults version http://liveweave.com/V3QmhC so you can see what I mean.
[06:35:24] <meteorNewbie> systemfault: Would you mind having a look at my update?
[06:38:10] <meteorNewbie> arthurvr: I like your version but alas I cannot use it.
[06:43:13] <antlong> does unbeforeunload work for a closed window in addition to refreshed?
[06:43:34] <decx> anybody know what was going on with freenode last night?
[06:46:36] <NaKroTeK> Hi, can someone look after my code, I'm missing the part where my iFrame fire a download file for the client. http://pastebin.com/DsQ64cvH
[06:47:39] <BillCriswell> decx: No idea. Anything on their twitter feed?
[06:48:11] <meteorNewbie> systemfault: I think I might be able to build on your version. Thanks for the help!
[06:48:37] <BillCriswell> decx: Not seeing anything on there actually. Not sure.
[06:48:46] <decx> nothing, and i don't feel like entering the cesspit that is #freenode
[06:48:59] <decx> still can't connect to my usual server
[06:49:15] <decx> i have to use port 6667 on amsterdam, yuk
[06:49:17] <BillCriswell> decx: I didn't even know you cuold choose which one lol.
[06:50:15] <decx> maybe the ssl certificate ran out? is that a thing that happens?
[06:58:00] <mbrzuzy> hey guys, is there any good way to add drag-drop file functionality to a contact form? I'm not seeing any good way to have both at once
[07:04:39] <decx> add more stuff to the form that processes the data blob`?
[07:08:15] <rahuldroy> hi guys, does anyone know a clean way to run a js function after all other scripts have executed on a page?
[07:09:01] <Maverickz> Hi guys, i would like your help please, i'm begginer in jQuery
[07:09:26] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: Put it after all the scripts before it.
[07:10:37] <Maverickz> I have an object [ { "brands" : "hh", "number": "10" }] that i want to change to [ { "label" : "hh", "data": "10" }]
[07:10:57] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: can you confirm that chrome doesn't execute scripts in parallel? as couple of them have $('document').ready on them
[07:16:26] <BillCriswell> Maverickz: You can use map or just loop through them.
[07:17:03] <BillCriswell> var mapped = items.map(function(item){ return { label: item.brands, data: item.number } });
[07:18:16] <Maverickz> i'm using flotcharts, that takes label and data as parameters, but in my rest api i've other names
[07:18:16] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: The document.readys would run in order when the document is ready.
[07:18:53] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: ok cool
[07:19:03] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: Thanks for your help
[07:19:08] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: No problem.
[07:19:17] <BillCriswell> Maverickz: The code I gave you should do what you asked.
[07:19:39] <Maverickz> BillCriswell: thanks, i'm going to google about map()
[07:20:25] <BillCriswell> Maverickz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map - if you need support for IE8- you could use jQuery's $.map instead.
[07:21:02] <Maverickz> thanks BillCriswell
[07:21:07] <BillCriswell> No probem.
[07:21:40] <decx> the normal map isnt supported in old ie?
[07:22:25] <BillCriswell> decx: Looking like it's only available in IE9+
[07:26:12] <Maverickz> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/gNdmSbaX is it correct ?
[07:27:31] <BillCriswell> "mapped = data.map((data) ->" this line looks funny, but I also don't know coffeescript.
[07:27:45] <DeliriumTremens> hi
[07:28:16] <decx> BillCriswell with this hack you can use normal map with old ie http://i.imgur.com/D2xnNj0.png
[07:28:28] <decx> huehuehue
[07:28:45] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on haha
[07:28:55] <Maverickz> BillCriswell: hehe i forgot a (
[07:29:11] <decx> never done 3d? that's a normal map :(
[07:29:33] <BillCriswell> decx: I haven't. I don't do anything fun really.
[07:29:52] <BillCriswell> Fucking around trying to get gems to play nicely usually.
[07:30:07] <decx> lol
[07:31:59] <BillCriswell> "That thing that was working yesterday? Nope... not today Bill."
[07:32:17] <FarLight> BillCriswell
[07:32:26] <BillCriswell> I mean sure, I probably messed something up. But it's no excuse dammit.
[07:32:26] <FarLight> Are you any relation to Billy Crystal
[07:32:34] <BillCriswell> FarLight: Yes.
[07:32:55] <FarLight> I'm imagining what you're saying in his voice now
[07:33:49] <BillCriswell> Can't even recall what he looks like.
[07:34:02] <BillCriswell> Oh come on I'm like... 1.05x better looking than this guy.
[07:34:27] <FarLight> So you say
[07:35:04] <FarLight> Everyone's good looking on the internet
[07:35:32] <decx> good lord he looks like the guy from battlestar galactica nowadays
[07:35:36] <decx> i mean babylon 5
[07:35:48] <BillCriswell> FarLight: That's true, that's true.
[07:36:08] <FarLight> You guys leave Billy alone!
[07:36:15] <FarLight> I'm sorry  I brought him up.
[07:37:05] <Forbidd3n> anyone that can help me with toggleClass and slideUp/Down with nested UL LI's?
[07:37:17] <BillCriswell> FarLight: Haha
[07:37:33] <Forbidd3n> I  basically want a ul if class dir is there, to slide down the next nested ul
[07:37:40] <Forbidd3n> and close all other ul's
[07:37:49] <Forbidd3n> set an attribute of data-open to the ul
[07:39:38] <FarLight> what do you mean the next nested ul?
[07:40:58] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Those patterns that auto close open stuff drive me nuts.
[07:42:15] <BillCriswell> If something above it closes automatically then your eyes need to follow it  up the page, it's just a mess.
[07:42:36] <BillCriswell> I'd try to talk whoever out of auto-closing before it gets too far.
[07:42:49] <decx> if you spend enough time calibrating the transitions so you don't have that little bump because the heights are not perfectly aligned accordion menus can be pretty cool
[07:43:35] <BillCriswell> The only time an accordion menu is OK to me is if it's on Weird Al's official site.
[07:43:53] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: It is a tree structure and I need to close the other dirs in the list to keep track of the current open dir so the user knows what dir they are uploading files to
[07:44:19] <decx> fiddle up
[07:44:34] <antlong> if i initialized a module, and i need to use it inside of another file, i don't do  var x = new x(); what do i do?
[07:44:49] <antlong> I'm using require.js btw, and its included
[07:45:34] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: OS X doesn't close them ones that aren't "active" automatically.
[07:46:10] <BillCriswell> doesn't close the ones*
[07:46:41] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Wouldn't the highlighted folder be the one you upload to?
[07:47:48] <Forbidd3n> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/bSNTS/
[07:48:03] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: yes, it could be that way I guess
[07:48:21] <Forbidd3n> but could get confusing if they have multiple tiers open
[07:49:11] <Forbidd3n> either way I would have to remove the class of the others clicked and then add the background color class to the one that is clicked
[07:49:26] <Forbidd3n> still moving things around with the eyes, no?
[07:49:43] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/decx/bSNTS/1/
[07:50:27] <Forbidd3n> decx: thanks. anyway to close the dir if it is open and they click it again
[07:50:39] <decx> chacnge show to toggle
[07:51:08] <decx> although that could fuck up something
[07:51:35] <Forbidd3n> ok, now when I click folder 2 and the child folder 2.1 it closes the parent
[07:52:04] <decx> yeah because that click bubbles up
[07:52:14] <decx> you can do it, i bolieve in you
[07:52:26] <Forbidd3n> ok, I will try to tackle it from here, thanks for the help
[07:55:04] <Forbidd3n> decx: can I do it in the chain or a separate command?
[07:56:07] <decx> it involes an e and a stop, an immediate, a propagation and a ()
[07:56:23] <evangeline_> hello guys: can somebody take a look at my web site http://www.proteansec.com/ and tell me what to do to keep the image below highlighted even when mouse leaves the image: currently I've implemented the functionality with CSS sprites, but I guess I also need some jQuery ?
[07:56:53] <BillCriswell> decx, Forbidd3n: http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/1/edit?html,js,output This is kind of what I was thinking.
[07:58:43] <BillCriswell> Very rough, but the gist.
[07:59:32] <decx> evangeline_ extend your :hover rule with a class which you can attach to your element on mouseenter with jquery
[08:00:27] <evangeline_> decx, can you give me any hints/tutorial where such a thing has been done?
[08:00:48] <decx> that's just basic traversal
[08:00:54] <decx> you can do it
[08:01:18] <decx> *sings the producers song*
[08:01:36] <evangeline_> decx, how can I extend the :hover rule with a class ... I've never heard of it
[08:02:01] <decx> .services:hover, .services.hovered { new background position }
[08:04:46] <evangeline_> decx, ok I've added: div.services-malware:hover, div.services-malware:hovered { ... }
[08:04:55] <decx> no
[08:08:16] <evangeline_> decx, I don't know why I have to set  .services:hover, .services.hovered { ... }, if each service has it's own CSS element; how can I set the background element if each service has it's own icon
[08:09:05] <decx> your css logic is overly verbose
[08:09:43] <evangeline_> decx, what do you mean?
[08:10:06] <decx> every .services-center has the background: url("/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sprite_products.png")
[08:10:18] <decx> instead of setting that for every one separately you do it once
[08:10:34] <decx> and then just background-position the relevant classes
[08:14:32] <decx> evangeline_ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8McSb/
[08:15:30] <decx> i'm sure if you restructured a bit you wouldnt even need js
[08:16:02] <decx> like have icons in a list and descriptions in a child element or something
[08:16:25] <djQuery_> seed = $divGame.children('div').get(x).addClass('green');
[08:16:45] <djQuery_> does .get return a jquery object?
[08:16:48] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: Will it work with nested dir's?
[08:16:57] <decx> get returns a vanilla object djQuery_
[08:17:07] <decx> therefore no jquery methods
[08:17:19] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ -> http://api.jquery.com/get/ check out the "returns"
[08:17:21] <decx> eq() for the jquery thing
[08:17:43] <djQuery_> decx, duch_kazatel gues I have to do nth child selector then
[08:18:02] <decx> eq
[08:18:10] <evangeline_> decx, ok I've changed what you've said to optimize the CSS code, but now all the images are dobled
[08:18:15] <evangeline_> s/dobled/doubled/
[08:18:29] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ you can use .eq() instead.
[08:19:36] <decx> evangeline_ you have services-center on the heading below the div as well, either give the icons another class name or css div.services-center (i suggest a better classname like .icon)
[08:19:44] <evangeline_> decx, ah, it's because the services-center is assigned to the text as well
[08:20:41] <decx> yes, with an .icon class name you attach your jquery events and css background image to that and do your background position stuff in .services-malware etc
[08:20:46] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, well if it hadn't hung on my I could
[08:21:28] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ huh?
[08:21:31] <decx> how good can protean security be anyway, they got wiped out 50000 years ago
[08:21:41] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, screen froze
[08:21:49] <evangeline_> decx, ok, I've changed it, thank you for the optimization tip, but how can I now leave the icon highlighted (orange) even after mouseleave ... and until the next mouseenter ?
[08:21:58] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ weird
[08:22:03] <decx> evangeline_ check my fiddle
[08:22:11] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, bad part of using something that outputs as you type
[08:24:55] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, still not working is return jquery object but complaining about addClass
[08:24:56] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/yicun/2/edit
[08:25:40] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf.  jsbin just locked up my browser.
[08:25:48] <evangeline_> decx, yeah I've checked your code, but all the services now have the hat as an icon (but each should have a different icon)
[08:26:13] <FarLight> The hat icon is a good one though
[08:26:15] <decx> obviously you need to add the background positions for the separate icon classes yourself
[08:26:35] <decx> i'm only helping, busy work costs money ^^
[08:26:47] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ it
[08:27:00] <duch_kazatel> *it's because $divGame.children('div') isn't working.
[08:27:03] <antlong> is anyone familiar with http://fastly.github.io/epoch/real-time/#line ? I'm trying to understand how to send the chart data
[08:28:19] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, had a typo
[08:29:00] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[08:39:37] <djQuery_> now to just add some collision detection and them keyboard controls
[08:39:40] <evangeline_> decx, ok I've changed it according to your tip, but I guess I screwed something up; could you take a quick look ?
[08:40:04] <djQuery_> evangeline_, like?
[08:40:07] <djQuery_> link
[08:40:55] <evangeline_> djQuery_, www.proteansec.com
[08:42:00] <devwork> I'm having an issue with my ajax requests are failing silently in 2.x and in 1.x they are firing the error callback with the status 'no transport'
[08:43:13] <devwork> It works on some browsers but the machine I'm having the issue with is embedded so i'm a bit limited in what I can test. Is there a way to get a more verbose error?
[08:43:21] <decx> i was trying to find it but 30 js files are too much for me too check evangeline_
[08:43:43] <djQuery_> evangeline_, you shouldnt have your jQuery(document).ready   inside your hide_hovered
[08:44:13] <djQuery_> remove line 706 and line 709
[08:44:17] <evangeline_> decx, it is in the main index file, not in any special .js
[08:44:23] <djQuery_> 708 rather
[08:44:24] <decx> SyntaxError: missing } after function body
[08:44:55] <decx> don't repeat all that for every class
[08:45:06] <decx> just one time for .services-icon
[08:46:20] <djQuery_> evangeline_, lets work from here
[08:46:21] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/diqujo/1/edit
[08:46:55] <djQuery_> evangeline_, first you should need more than 1 jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
[08:47:05] <antlong> has anyone had issues installing d3 with require.js?
[08:47:22] <djQuery_> everett, 2nd you shouldnt nest a jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { inside another function
[08:47:48] <djQuery_> everett, sorry ment for evangeline_
[08:48:01] <evangeline_> djQuery_, I've changed the code according to what decx said, can we start from the current code (if you refresh)?
[08:49:09] <evangeline_> djQuery_, btw: how do you guys see the error so quickly; what tools do you use, I'm interested because it can come in handy in penetration testing ?
[08:49:40] <djQuery_> evangeline_, hit f12 in your browser then click on the console tab
[08:49:45] <duch_kazatel> i don't think normal dev tools are good for that kind of thing, but all major browsers have an inspector of some kind now.
[08:50:04] <duch_kazatel> hell, even IE 11 has really good tools.
[08:50:18] <djQuery_> evangeline_, your not getting any errors now related to javascript anyway
[08:50:23] <evangeline_> djQuery_, yeah I'm using them myself, but chrome doesn't actually display the line number - I was wondering whether you use something different, apparrently not
[08:50:36] <djQuery_> evangeline_, yes it does
[08:50:47] <djQuery_> in console over to the far left
[08:51:00] <djQuery_> then you can just click on it to go to that line in the file
[08:51:06] <evangeline_> if I press refresh, the console prints: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[08:51:08] <djQuery_> evangeline_, thats all I use
[08:51:29] <djQuery_> evangeline_, yeah and thats pointing to the first line
[08:51:30] <evangeline_> to the far right it says: (index):1
[08:51:53] <evangeline_> yeah, but the first line is fine, isn't it?
[08:52:12] <djQuery_> evangeline_, just refreshed and didnt get it
[08:52:41] <djQuery_> evangeline_,  instead of having to this over and over again  $('#desc-malware').addClass('hide');
[08:53:14] <djQuery_> for each one is there something that they all have in common that you can search for?
[08:53:41] <devwork> it seems that my issue is coming from the $.ajax method-- is there a safe way to reimplement the xhr method?
[08:53:57] <duch_kazatel> devwork O.O what are you trying to do.
[08:54:05] <evangeline_> djQuery_, yeah, they are all part of the desc class
[08:54:08] <duch_kazatel> and what problem are you having?
[08:54:34] <devwork> My problem is that I have an embedded system that sometimes requires the use of an http proxy
[08:54:45] <devwork> When the proxy is enabled, my ajax calls fail
[08:54:54] <duch_kazatel> what errors are you getting?
[08:55:05] <devwork> 1.x says 'no trainsport', 2.x fails silently
[08:55:10] <djQuery_> evangeline_, so just $('.desc').addClass('hide');
[08:55:19] <devwork> *transport
[08:55:29] <evangeline_> djQuery_, yes, makes sense and it's a lot cleaner
[08:56:12] <duch_kazatel> devwork that sounds wrong to me - sounds like the proxy is doing some things it shouldn't.
[08:56:24] <devwork> to implement the proxy, our sdk modifys the XMLHttpRequest-- this isn't something that we can change
[08:56:31] <evangeline_> djQuery_, just updated
[08:56:58] <devwork> And it works outside of jquery however we are switching to backbone which requires it for ajax.
[08:56:59] <duch_kazatel> devwork you're going to have a helluva time then.
[08:57:18] <devwork> Does jQuery have any mechinism to replace methods?
[08:57:29] <djQuery_> evangeline_, some of you images are timing out as well
[08:57:43] <devwork> like could I just $.ajax = mymethod?
[08:57:48] <evangeline_> djQuery_, which ones ?
[08:57:48] <duch_kazatel> javascript does, but I'd caution against solving this problem in javascript/jquery land.
[08:58:08] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm having a bit of a debate here in the office about jquery widgets and plugins. I wasn't really able to find a definetive argument by googling, anyone have some insight here?
[08:58:15] <djQuery_> evangeline_, GET https://www.proteansec.com/wp-content/themes/Avada/images/ls_next.png net::ERR_TIMED_OUT
[08:58:21] <duch_kazatel> devwork wait what browsers are you getting that error in?
[08:58:22] <checkit> ^ what the difference is
[08:58:36] <duch_kazatel> checkit the difference between a widget and a plugin?
[08:58:44] <decx> semantics
[08:59:00] <devwork> Its a webkit based set top box for televisions.
[08:59:06] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Yessir
[08:59:27] <duch_kazatel> I'd argue a "widget" is a visual modular thing, whereas a plugin is anything that extends jQuery.
[08:59:33] <duch_kazatel> at least when talking about jquery.
[09:00:29] <evangeline_> djQuery_, weird because the image is there:
[09:00:32] <evangeline_> # du -sh wp-content/themes/Avada/images/ls_next.png
[09:00:32] <evangeline_> 4.0K    wp-content/themes/Avada/images/ls_next.png
[09:00:38] <evangeline_> it could be the CDN thing
[09:00:48] <duch_kazatel> checkit for instance: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie plugin.
[09:01:07] <devwork> Normally I would be against hacking core, but in this case I'm really struggling to find the root cause since I don't have an inspector on the platform which is failing
[09:01:13] <checkit> duch_kazatel: That was argument as well
[09:01:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.iceburg.net/jqModal/ plugin that's also arguabley a widget.
[09:02:27] <evangeline_> djQuery_, ok, so I now I have somewhat optimized CSS, but the images are still not left highlighted when the mouse leaves the current icon ...
[09:02:27] <djQuery_> evangeline_, http://jsbin.com/diqujo/1/edit
[09:05:35] <djQuery_> evangeline_, what part of the screen is that on
[09:06:28] <djQuery_> evangeline_, those nice icons at the bottom?
[09:07:10] <evangeline_> djQuery_, ok I've changed the code according to the snippet: the 6 icons on the Home screen are highlighted if you hover over them (orange) ... but once the mouse leaves the icon, the icon is no longer highlighted (light grey) ... I would like to leave the icon highlighted (orange) until the next icon is selected
[09:07:13] <evangeline_> djQuery_, yes
[09:07:48] <evangeline_> djQuery_, thank you for expressing your opinion about icons being nice :)
[09:25:57] <devwork> Has anyone here worked on the ajax methods? I'm having trouble figuring out an issue in the inspectPrefiltersOrTransports method
[09:26:35] <devwork> Its failing, but i can make a raw xhr without issue
[09:33:30] <EminenceHC> I am using this jquery code to find the sum whenever an input with class .sum-fields changes. However when a new field is added dynamically and the value is changed it is not included in the calculation. How can I have this calculation work on dynamically created fields? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/e2aba75fcf3cb34c47c9
[09:34:14] <duch_kazatel> event delegation
[09:34:31] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks Ill check it out.
[09:34:32] <duch_kazatel> also -  $(".sum-hours").each(function() {
[09:34:34] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[09:34:47] <EminenceHC> What is wrong with it?
[09:34:57] <duch_kazatel> totally unnecessary.
[09:35:09] <EminenceHC> Which part is unnecessary?
[09:35:18] <duch_kazatel> you can just do y
[09:35:18] <duch_kazatel> [2014:07:11:09:34:31] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks Ill
[09:35:20] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[09:35:23] <duch_kazatel> $(".sum-hours").keyup(function() {
[09:35:23] <duch_kazatel> that
[09:35:36] <duch_kazatel> no need to .each() - that part is implied.
[09:35:42] <duch_kazatel> what's the parent container that you're adding these to?
[09:36:00] <EminenceHC> Oh ok.. don't wrap it in that right just add the selector to the keyup?
[09:36:08] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:36:24] <duch_kazatel> what's the parent container you're appending the .sum-hours to?
[09:37:44] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Its an input. Do you want to know the parent of the input?
[09:38:11] <duch_kazatel> yes - the parent that exists on pageload.
[09:38:30] <EminenceHC> The most immediate parent?
[09:38:53] <EminenceHC> <div class="controls">
[09:38:58] <duch_kazatel> and that exists on pageload?
[09:39:17] <duch_kazatel> ie all new .sum-hours are children of that single element?
[09:39:39] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Oh i see what you mean.. no I will find that one.
[09:39:59] <decx> i think that paragraph is pretty good http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:40:59] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I made it this:  <div class="exists-on-page-load">
[09:41:12] <duch_kazatel> lol.
[09:41:15] <EminenceHC> :)
[09:41:44] <EminenceHC> Also when I remove that .each wrapper and append the selector to the keyup like you mentioned my output is NaN
[09:41:48] <duch_kazatel> then it'll look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/R7N4y/1/
[09:42:45] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Scratch that.. your code works perfectly. I understand now.
[09:43:13] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I have so much platonic love for you right now.. haha
[09:43:28] <duch_kazatel> also - $('div #total-amount') is unnecessary and inefficient :)
[09:43:32] <duch_kazatel> just do #total-amount
[09:43:38] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Gotcha
[09:47:39] <berpcor> Stupid question. I written a peace of code (it works in a specific page). When I open a different page I have error in console and all of the rest f code doesn't work. Why?
[09:47:53] <duch_kazatel> what's the error in the console?
[09:48:53] <berpcor> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[09:49:04] <berpcor> In the code I work with DOM.
[09:49:13] <duch_kazatel> that means your selector is bad.
[09:49:59] <berpcor> Yes, I understand that. But earlier I was writing my code in a different way (not object-oriented) and it worked...
[09:50:12] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:50:22] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing your code?
[09:51:42] <berpcor> http://laravel.io/bin/n56Qk
[09:52:16] <decx> no filter element on your new pag
[09:52:17] <decx> e
[09:52:17] <duch_kazatel> is this in a document ready?
[09:52:38] <decx> .filter*
[09:52:38] <berpcor> No, it is at the end of my page
[09:53:48] <duch_kazatel> when you say "open a different page", do you mean you're loading a new page, or is it getting ajax'd in?>
[09:54:59] <berpcor> Yes, there is no filter on my page. As I said, earlier I put everything in document ready and was writing code in a procedural way and it worked everywhere. Even if the current page has no any element...
[09:55:12] <berpcor> A new page
[09:55:26] <berpcor> Without Ajax.
[09:55:40] <duch_kazatel> why do it OO?  why not functional?
[09:56:21] <berpcor> I am exploring a new things )
[09:56:43] <duch_kazatel> this cose assumes .filter exists.  you'll have to manually check if it doesn't.
[09:56:54] <duch_kazatel> you could instead do it functionally, though you'll have the same problem.
[09:57:33] <berpcor> For now I did the following. I added span.page-class (flags) on pages and check for length.
[09:57:51] <berpcor> This is the right way of doing such things?
[09:58:05] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[10:00:04] <berpcor> When it could be not applicable?
[10:01:42] <duch_kazatel> why run the code at all if that element doesn't exist?
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> why couple your page data to your code so tightly?
[10:01:55] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:06:41] <decx> *oh lebron james going back to the cavs, let's see what the heat fans think* --- this subreddit is private
[10:07:08] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: What am I to do then. Load separate peace of code for each page?
[10:14:57] <w00tb3ast> Need a bit of help, I have a string that is essentially a cookie and I am removing a substring from it but all the other string are indexed and I need to re-index them, can anyone help (I'm not good with regEx etc). Fiddle is: http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/1/
[10:17:20] <duch_kazatel> berpcor sorry was away.  in some cases, yes.
[10:17:47] <duch_kazatel> berpcor we have some files that are on every page, and others that are included only on specific pages.
[10:18:08] <berpcor> It slows down page loading...
[10:18:23] <duch_kazatel> not if you do it right?
[10:18:41] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to minify everything into one big file.
[10:21:26] <berpcor> And what should I do?
[10:21:34] <berpcor> Teach me...
[10:24:30] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: you still there
[10:24:35] <w00tb3ast> Anyone got any idea of how I can change a whole bunch of numbers in a string? I have a string (that is essentially a cookie) with some numbers in it that I need to re-index? Fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/1/
[10:25:04] <Forbidd3n> first, thanks for your example and I agree with you in regards to sliding. I like the highlighted part of it. works much better.
[10:25:20] <Forbidd3n> quick question though, it doesn't toggle the selected class - it doesn't remove it on click
[10:25:44] <Forbidd3n> well it does, but when you click to close it, then selected is still there not removed
[10:26:16] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, well you could start by doing a split on it first on ,
[10:26:23] <djQuery_> get it into a nice array
[10:26:30] <duch_kazatel> berpcor it's a pretty big subject, but you can basically do what I'm suggesting.
[10:27:12] <berpcor> Ok
[10:27:28] <BillCriswell> You betcha.
[10:27:30] <BillCriswell> Sadly.
[10:27:36] <BillCriswell> One day I won't be.
[10:27:44] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ yeeesss....
[10:29:18] <duch_kazatel> berpcor basically you have your big ol' file that's included on every page, and then have one file that's specific to each page.  after the initial cache, you should be fine.
[10:29:37] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, then just loop through the array and see if '[' + number ']' exists
[10:29:38] <duch_kazatel> just make sure you organize your code well in those files and you're a-ok
[10:30:04] <w00tb3ast> so what if I wanted 2 to go down to 1 then 3 to go down to 2 that all part of the loop?
[10:30:06] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, next time i would try putting it in something like localstorage instead of a cookie if possible
[10:30:24] <w00tb3ast> Yeah I wish I could have haha
[10:31:36] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: the reason is because here it is removing all selected - $dirs.find('a').removeClass('selected'); and then it toggles it back on here $a.toggleClass('selected'); because it was already removed
[10:31:58] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Stil have the url?
[10:32:01] <Forbidd3n> anyway to remove all selected except for the one that is currenlty clicked
[10:32:07] <Forbidd3n> http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/3/edit
[10:32:13] <Forbidd3n> there is your url
[10:32:16] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: Got it, thanks.
[10:32:42] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, dang thats actualy not easy
[10:33:15] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/2/edit
[10:33:20] <djQuery_> split into an array first
[10:33:55] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, loop through the array and extract the number between [] discard it if it is = to number
[10:34:23] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: not selecting it the first time round hmm
[10:35:17] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/4/edit this might be better
[10:35:18] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, if the [num] is < number then just add it to a new array
[10:35:33] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: My brian was kind of everywhere this morning.
[10:36:03] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, do a string.replace in it if it is larger than your num and then add it to the array if it is greater than your num
[10:36:36] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, finaly do a .join on the new array and put it back in the cookie
[10:36:48] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, pain but you can do it
[10:38:38] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: still not working - the issue is that it is removing all selected classes and then toggle of course readds it because it was removed previously
[10:39:33] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: I'm not using toggle on selected in http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/4/edit
[10:39:48] <BillCriswell> I'm only toggling the open state
[10:40:03] <Forbidd3n> not on the class selected
[10:40:17] <Forbidd3n> see above you are removing the selected class from all 'a'
[10:40:34] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Right.
[10:40:35] <Forbidd3n> then toggleClass('selected') on the current 'a', which is adding it since it was previously removed
[10:40:57] <BillCriswell> toggleClass('selected') is not in the link I gave to you.
[10:41:00] <Forbidd3n> I tried to change this to addClass, but didn't seem to work
[10:42:54] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: ok on the new link you gave me click on Meow 4 and then Ribbit 1 then meow 5
[10:43:08] <Forbidd3n> it doesn't add teh selected unless you click meow 5 twice
[10:43:30] <BillCriswell> It adds it for me on the first click.
[10:43:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/xuqafeki/4/edit you're looking at this link, right?
[10:45:18] <Forbidd3n> yeah, click meow 4, then ribbit then meo4 again it selects it but it is closed therefore it shouldn't be selected correct
[10:45:36] <Forbidd3n> it should only select it, 'highlight' it when it is open even when clicked, correct?
[10:45:52] <decx> i wonder what's 'better' $dirs.find('a').not($a) or $li.siblings().find('a')
[10:45:56] <w00tb3ast> sorry got disconnted.
[10:46:09] <w00tb3ast> I'm still struggling with my string loop/re-indexing thing
[10:46:15] <Forbidd3n> decx: they do the same thing correcf/
[10:46:17] <Forbidd3n> correct
[10:46:27] <decx> well yeah
[10:46:40] <Forbidd3n> li selects less of them I guess
[10:46:47] <Forbidd3n> versus dir selects all
[10:46:53] <BillCriswell> $li.find('a') would be enough wouldn't it?
[10:46:55] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, have you looked at jquery ui menu?
[10:47:28] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: The last thing you clicked is "active"
[10:47:52] <Forbidd3n> anyway to get it to be active highlighted only if it is open?
[10:48:01] <Forbidd3n> if that makes sense
[10:49:16] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, if you click on something else to colapse it what you clicked on would be active higlighted
[10:50:08] <Forbidd3n> djQuery_: yes, but if you parent was open and child was active and highlighte and then you click parent it would close since it is toggling which is correct, but it highlights it as though it was active
[10:50:28] <Forbidd3n> it works the way it is suppose to, it seems as it is a preference thing I guess
[10:50:50] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, there would be no way to togle close otherwise
[10:50:57] <w00tb3ast> ok I've updated the fiddle djQuery_ but still struggling to get my head around it
[10:51:43] <Forbidd3n> I will just add a link at the top that says close all and it will remove selected/open from all 'a'
[10:51:43] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, you went off line so I closed it
[10:51:50] <w00tb3ast> http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/4/
[10:51:51] <devwork> Is there a way to override defaults in the jqxhr object?
[10:51:55] <Forbidd3n> thanks very much BillCriswell, it is much appreciated!
[10:52:05] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: So you're going to have something "selected" that's hidden from the users view?
[10:52:11] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: No problem.
[10:53:22] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, test to see if it has open   but does not have selected
[10:53:43] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, if so add selected and do not toggle open unless it has both
[10:53:57] <djQuery_> Forbidd3n, but might cause more headaches
[10:54:48] <BillCriswell> in OSX there's a triangle to toggle open and closed and you have to click the file name to actually select it, but once a selected items parent is closed it's no longer selected.
[10:55:16] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ sorry to bug but did you get that fiddle link?
[10:55:29] <Forbidd3n> djQuery_: I will leave it the way it is and give a close all option
[10:56:19] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Okie doke.
[10:58:08] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/5/
[10:59:37] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/6/
[10:59:51] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, does it realy matter what the numbers are?
[11:00:06] <Sefid_par> How can I do css change one after another (not changing). on different selections.
[11:00:18] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ yeah they need to be sequential because it is used to build a list
[11:00:28] <duch_kazatel> Sefid_par wut
[11:00:48] <Sefid_par> wut?
[11:00:52] <Sefid_par> what is wut?
[11:00:56] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, looks like you going to be learning a lot of indeOf, substring
[11:01:05] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ so totalCount is actually the cookie_count value being pulled from the cookie
[11:01:21] <duch_kazatel> Sefid_par it's "what" but in a confused mannger - could you re-explain what you wnat?
[11:02:14] <Sefid_par> I want to change one element's color and after a delay change another one.
[11:02:46] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/7/
[11:02:48] <duch_kazatel> you could use setTimeout() to do that.
[11:03:03] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ it doesn't seem to be actually pushing things to the array
[11:03:08] <Sefid_par> duch_kazatel: Thank you.
[11:03:36] <duch_kazatel> $('#thing1').css('color', 'blue'); setTimeout(function() {$('#thing2'.css('color', 'red'))}); <- something like this.
[11:03:50] <BillCriswell> Sefid_par: http://jsbin.com/duyora/6/edit I used this not too long ago.
[11:04:17] <BillCriswell> http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/ this is a good post from a while ago about it as well.
[11:14:31] <djQuery_> w00tb3ast, http://jsfiddle.net/EH7Ah/10/    I seem to have substring wrong here
[11:14:40] <djQuery_> been a long time since I have used it
[11:20:08] <djQuery_> num = temp.match('\['+[\d.] + '\]');
[11:20:15] <djQuery_> I hate regular expressions
[11:20:30] <djQuery_> need to match   "[23]"
[11:20:49] <mdev> yeah regexp is tricky stuff
[11:23:51] <djQuery_>  num = temp.match('\['+[\d*] + '\]');
[11:23:54] <djQuery_> still not there
[11:26:04] <devwork> djQuery_: match [23] expliitly?
[11:26:13] <devwork> or any number in brackets?
[11:26:35] <djQuery_> devwork, (\[\d*\])
[11:27:23] <devwork> is that the working one?
[11:27:56] <djQuery_> devwork, should be but causing me unexpected token  errors
[11:28:03] <w00tb3ast> djQuery_ thanks of the help I think I might be doing it differently my boss doesn't like the way it works haha :S
[11:28:04] <djQuery_>  num = temp.match(\[\d*\]);
[11:28:16] <devwork> you need a delimiter?
[11:28:41] <devwork> /\[d*\]/g ?
[11:29:07] <djQuery_> devwork, only want the first
[11:29:13] <devwork> ah
[11:29:34] <devwork> its been a while since i've used regex on a day to day basis :P
[11:30:12] <djQuery_> devwork, num = temp.match(/\[\d*\]/); this works
[11:34:01] <devwork> yeah, you need the delimiters
[11:36:08] <djQuery_> this site is pretty cool http://www.regexr.com/
[11:51:44] <devwork> thats really cool djQuery_
[11:52:16] <devwork> Oreilly's "mastering regular expressions" is a really good resource too
[11:55:25] <Forbidd3n> is it possible to use toggleClass to change the class name between classes? for example I have a folderOpen and folderClose class and if open I want to toggle to close and if closed I want to toggle to open
[11:55:46] <djQuery_> sure
[11:55:51] <djQuery_> just put them both on there
[11:55:52] <Forbidd3n> I tried toggleClass('open close'); but that just removes one and adds the other is that correct?
[11:56:05] <Forbidd3n> I might have something wrong, thanks djQuery_
[11:56:50] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n toggleClass() just removes if it's there, and adds if it's not
[11:59:40] <devwork> Forbidd3n: one solution could be to assign two classes: folder and folderOpen
[11:59:52] <Forbidd3n> devwork: I have it working, thanks though
[11:59:58] <devwork> gotcha
[12:00:03] <devwork> np
[12:08:36] <meisth0th> hello
[12:09:06] <meisth0th> how can i revert the function i apply on .hover() on unhover?
[12:09:13] <meisth0th> i don't want to revert all the things manually.
[12:14:06] <decx> what thlngs
[12:15:45] <w00tb3ast> Quick question how to I remove something from document.query
[12:15:57] <djQuery_> decx, dont you have the psychic plugin installed in your chat
[12:16:08] <w00tb3ast> document.cookie*
[12:17:29] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: Set it, but make the date in the past.
[12:18:29] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: Much easier to google that.
[12:18:57] <w00tb3ast> BillCriswell how do you mean? my cookie gets created like this: http://jsfiddle.net/bZT6L/
[12:19:42] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: You'd need to set the expire date to a time before now.
[12:20:00] <w00tb3ast> any amount of time before now?
[12:20:15] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:20:33] <BillCriswell> Why the hell are they called cookies?
[12:20:42] <BillCriswell> I want to google that... kind of.
[12:20:43] <devwork> because they are bad for you.
[12:21:22] <devwork> whichever department is responsible for localstorage/cookies/etc at w3 really needs to step up their game
[12:21:45] <BillCriswell> Haha I like localStorage
[12:22:02] <BillCriswell> It appears the word "cookies" goes back a while.
[12:22:05] <devwork> its better than cookies but the lack of object support is just dumb.
[12:22:34] <w00tb3ast> hmmm
[12:22:34] <djQuery_> could we just get mongodb in the browser please
[12:22:51] <devwork> i was about to say something along those lines djQuery_
[12:23:07] <devwork> native key/value pairs would be so much nicer than sqlite
[12:23:09] <BillCriswell> I just stringify when I need to do that.
[12:23:24] <devwork> well you can't stringify everything
[12:23:30] <BillCriswell> There used to be WebSQL.
[12:23:30] <devwork> cyclical references and such
[12:23:36] <devwork> websql still exists
[12:23:39] <devwork> but its sqlite
[12:23:50] <BillCriswell> websql in the browser?
[12:23:59] <jParkton> make it bill!
[12:24:03] <devwork> yeah
[12:24:04] <jParkton> I will help
[12:24:13] <jParkton> as in add comments
[12:24:16] <jParkton> LOL
[12:24:25] <basiclaser> hey guys, if im taking a string of numbers separated by spaces, i seem to get only the first number
[12:24:31] <devwork> i think i found a legit bug in jquery 2
[12:24:41] <devwork> :P
[12:24:43] <basiclaser> and only index[0] is defined
[12:24:56] <BillCriswell> devwork: http://html5doctor.com/introducing-web-sql-databases/
[12:24:58] <jParkton> basiclaser: 0.o
[12:25:08] <devwork> i know, but i hate sql :P
[12:25:09] <jParkton> seperated by spaces?
[12:25:22] <devwork> nosql ftw
[12:25:22] <jParkton> var this = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]; ?
[12:25:26] <wfq> hi guys
[12:25:45] <jParkton> jello
[12:25:45] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Do you have a demo somewhere?
[12:25:47] <mdev> why is nosql useful
[12:25:52] <mdev> isn;t far less powerful than sql?
[12:26:02] <jParkton> no
[12:26:13] <djQuery_> jParkton, well thats not a string thats an incoctly made array
[12:26:18] <jParkton> its a database, a db can be made using almost anything
[12:26:18] <basiclaser> jParkton: the input is a string of characters which im trying to coerce into an array, or even just print as a string, but only first char shows.. its nodeschool.io learn node exercise 2 :P
[12:26:26] <jParkton> djQuery_: Obviously
[12:26:40] <jParkton> I only put it there to understand basiclaser query
[12:26:43] <devwork> its really dependant on usecase mdev, sometimes you don't want a relational db
[12:26:44] <BillCriswell> I've only ever played with nosql never actually used it for anyting.
[12:26:55] <jParkton> oh
[12:26:58] <jParkton> Baby steps?
[12:27:22] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Are you doing something like parseInt("1 3 4", 10) ?
[12:27:29] <devwork> basiclaser: Although there are many array like methods in strings they are not the same as the actual array ones
[12:28:06] <basiclaser> jParkton: im taking inputs from process.argv
[12:28:07] <djQuery_> basiclaser, https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues
[12:28:14] <jParkton> yes
[12:28:24] <basiclaser> thanks :)
[12:28:32] <jParkton> bashusr: you need it like console.log(process.argv[2])
[12:28:43] <jParkton> there is your numerical inputs index
[12:28:45] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: I think you might want like... process.argv.slice(2)
[12:28:46] <jParkton> [2]
[12:28:49] <bashusr> no i don't
[12:28:54] <xMopxShell> hey, in $.animate, is there a way to specify a start value and an end value?
[12:28:56] <jParkton> also what bill said
[12:29:12] <jParkton> xMopxShell: .animate(params, here)
[12:29:14] * bashusr goes back to sleep ;-)
[12:29:16] <basiclaser> jParkton: yeh i do that as you said but it just sees 2 3 3 2 as 2
[12:29:23] <jParkton> ohh
[12:29:24] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Nighty night!
[12:29:26] <basiclaser> ill try slie
[12:29:29] <jParkton> put your code somewhere
[12:29:31] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: night!
[12:29:34] <devwork> ^
[12:29:36] <jParkton> jsfiddle or hastebin
[12:29:41] <devwork> it sounds like a type issue to me.
[12:29:54] <jParkton> its only a one line string you need to verify that one
[12:29:54] <xMopxShell> jParkton: that's the ending position. is there a way to specify the start there too?
[12:30:09] <decx> that start is what it is
[12:30:12] <jParkton> xMopxShell: if you look at the docs it tells you
[12:30:15] <jParkton> I think?
[12:30:39] <xMopxShell> jParkton: I didn't see it.
[12:30:49] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: That should give an array of eerything after "node" and "filename"
[12:30:53] <decx> why do you need the start

[12:31:33] <BillCriswell> Do you have a link right to the question?
[12:31:45] <jParkton> xMopxShell: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animate-properties-options
[12:31:49] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: sorry its running in console
[12:31:53] <jParkton> options is the obj you need
[12:31:55] <BillCriswell> Ohyeah.
[12:31:59] <jParkton> start, stop
[12:32:28] <jParkton> basiclaser: the issue is the for loop
[12:32:32] <xMopxShell> jParkton: isn't that just a callback fn?
[12:32:32] <jParkton> it is not needed
[12:32:32] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Is it the one where you sum up all the numbers passed after: node foo.js 2 3 4 5
[12:32:45] <jParkton> yes Bill
[12:33:04] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: yes, im trying to iterate through it as a string, because the whole coercing to numbers thing didnt work out either
[12:33:21] <wfq_> hi guys
[12:33:38] <xMopxShell> I see, they're in the promise
[12:33:54] <devwork> basiclaser: that seems like a bad idea
[12:33:56] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: incidently, are nested arrays ( process.argv[2[i]] ) valid?
[12:34:00] <jParkton> basiclaser: console.log(process.argv.reduce(function(x+y){return Number(x)+Number(y)}));
[12:34:06] <jParkton> something like that
[12:34:07] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: If you do process.argv.slice(2) that'll return [2,3,4,5]
[12:34:07] <devwork> type abuse!
[12:34:12] <jParkton> lol
[12:34:27] <devwork> BillCriswell has the right answer
[12:34:37] <BillCriswell> process.argv.slice(2).reduce(function(prev, cur){ return prev + cur }, 0); is what I think I used.
[12:34:40] <xMopxShell> jParkton: it appears those values are not used to start the animation
[12:35:06] <jParkton> bra
[12:35:11] <jParkton> google has da answers
[12:35:12] <decx> what's your usecase to feed starting values to animate
[12:35:13] <jParkton> one sec
[12:35:17] <decx> i don't get it
[12:35:28] <basiclaser> jParkton: BillCriswell great thanks very much ill study your answers
[12:35:33] <decx> just write it in the css
[12:35:49] <wfq> guys I just don't know where to start by. I have inherited the worst javascript code ever. I have tried to add a .submit(event) to do a futher check at the last moment in spite of using jquery.validate. It happens that when I click that button an a figure is wrong I show a red label message next to that field. Until here all good. If I press that button twice the bloody label get hidden - display:none
[12:35:52] <jParkton> xMopxShell: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2884221/how-to-start-stop-restart-jquery-animation
[12:35:57] <jParkton> possibly?
[12:36:12] <jParkton> decx: is right
[12:36:17] <jParkton> just use css animations
[12:36:35] <decx> that too but that's not what i mean
[12:36:36] <wfq> If I comment out the validate () method that is as well in the same module the problem disappears. Never mind if I press the button X times the message will remain there for as long as the user do not type in the write one
[12:36:54] <wfq> what on earth is happening here? I am desperate. I just can't figure out what is going on here
[12:37:12] <xMopxShell> jParkton: jquery is reading some properties wrong in IE. so I want to manually specify them
[12:37:34] <jParkton> ahh
[12:37:38] <jParkton> IE hax
[12:37:53] <jParkton> also IE has issue with Jquery
[12:37:53] <mdev> when I do memcache.connect(function() {}); I can't wait for it to finish before continuing can I, only when it finishes will it call that callback?
[12:37:59] <jParkton> so might wanna test it a bit
[12:38:05] <mdev> ignore the memccache I just mean functions like that in general
[12:39:03] <BillCriswell> basiclaser: Not sure if those numbers will come through as numbers so you may need to do like +prev + +cur
[12:39:11] <wfq> any idea please?
[12:39:50] <devwork> does anyone know if error behavior changed in 2.x from 1.x?
[12:39:59] <devwork> wfq: can you jsfiddle?
[12:40:03] <jParkton> wfq, Dione Warwick works like that, we cannot
[12:40:06] <basiclaser> BillCriswell: i really appreciate it! will study it in the morn
[12:40:07] <basiclaser> peace
[12:40:12] <BillCriswell> Later.
[12:43:39] <wfq> I know guys. It is impossible to take the fucking messy code. Someone should be shot dead if he is still alive.
[12:44:23] <decx> you didnt post any code yet
[12:51:16] <xMopxShell> jParkton: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4211461/using-jquery-animate-to-start-at-one-value-and-end-at-another
[12:51:20] <xMopxShell> last answer will work :D
[12:51:27] <jParkton> nice!
[12:51:40] <jParkton> I despise IE for that reason
[12:51:41] <jParkton> lol
[12:51:52] <jParkton> get a real browser pl0x
[12:53:38] <wfq> Is tehre any way of adding as one more rule in the validate method on jquery.validate that the final result (form valid or invalid) depends on the outcome of the .submit event?
[12:55:17] <djQuery_> dang these arent easy if you don't know node
[12:55:55] <Joergi> Hi guys!
[12:56:31] <Joergi> I have two lines of code, where I want to know, if there is a better, a nicer way of writing them. Here they are:
[12:56:51] <Joergi> 	if (isset($values['value'])) {
[12:57:00] <Joergi> if ($values['value'] != '') {
[12:57:09] <thinkxl> Joergi don't paste code in here, use pastebin or jsfiddle
[12:57:29] <jParkton> djQuery_: indeed
[12:57:31] <BillCriswell> Joergi: Think you want php?
[12:57:57] <jParkton> lol
[12:58:11] <jParkton> one line
[12:58:15] <jParkton> what a penis
[12:58:28] <BillCriswell> You can do if(isset($values['value'] && !empty($values['value'])) { }
[12:59:28] <djQuery_> jParkton, keep getting an extra output of undefined on the 3rd one
[13:00:06] <jParkton> of the baby steps one?
[13:00:27] <Joergi> BillCriswell: The thing is that I don't know, if $values['value'] is defined - it might be missing, which - without the isset() - gives me a warning... :-(
[13:00:48] <BillCriswell> Joergi: Right, in my example I'm doing both: if(isset($values['value'] && !empty($values['value'])) { }
[13:01:10] <jParkton> &&
[13:01:10] <wfq> Right. I think I understand the problem. Is there anyway to make all the rules defined within the validate method to run only at the time of submit please?
[13:01:21] <jParkton> wfq yes
[13:01:39] <jParkton> add a function('submit', somecallback
[13:02:35] <wfq> JParkton but where? Do you mean within the validate method?
[13:03:09] <djQuery_> jParkton, https://gist.github.com/djQuery/bc6f3520b8d898a874bb
[13:03:53] <jParkton> im not familiar with the validate method wfq, but you can make an anon function and make the callback .validate()
[13:03:59] <djQuery_> jParkton, sometimes I am an idiot
[13:04:09] <jParkton> oh that one
[13:04:17] <Joergi> BillCriswell: Ha, fine! :-) I didn't know _that_ was the way to check for the existance and emptiness of an index _without_ getting a warning!
[13:04:18] <duch_kazatel> wfq which plugin is it?
[13:04:20] <jParkton> I dunno I gave up for a few lol
[13:04:26] <Joergi> BillCriswell: Thanks!
[13:04:58] <Joergi> Last question: Do you know the name of a channel about PHP here on IRC? #php is invitation only...
[13:05:02] <wfq> jquery.validate
[13:05:26] <A_Nonny_Mouse> I want to make a very dynamic menu that rings of smartphone apps in the body of my page. Can I use jquery to do this?
[13:05:39] <BillCriswell> Joergi: You probably want ##Php
[13:05:44] <BillCriswell> Er, ##php
[13:05:55] <BillCriswell> not sure fi the capital makes a difference, but you definitely want ##php
[13:06:04] <wfq> I think that could do: http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-validation-validate-form-submit/
[13:06:57] <Joergi> BillCriswell: Gives me "Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services"
[13:07:23] <BillCriswell> Joergi: You need to register your nick.
[13:07:23] <Joergi> Sems I need to register my nick...
[13:07:34] <Joergi> Argh...yeah. ;-)
[13:07:48] <Joergi> Will do next time!
[13:07:57] <Joergi> Thanks again for your help! Bye!
[13:08:16] <A_Nonny_Mouse> How can I use jQuery to make an animated menu? I dont mean accordion, I mean something custom like floating pictures that
[13:08:29] <BillCriswell> /msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
[13:08:32] <BillCriswell> that should do it
[13:08:37] <A_Nonny_Mouse> when clicked on open up a tree of pictures underneath that then lead to some other page
[13:08:37] <BillCriswell> No problem. later
[13:09:00] <duch_kazatel> A_Nonny_Mouse sure.
[13:09:12] <duch_kazatel> that's a normal menu with pictures instead of text.
[13:10:40] <A_Nonny_Mouse> But I want the square menu pictures to shrink away from the selected one
[13:10:53] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Like theyre making room for it to expand
[13:11:03] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a job for masonry maybe?
[13:11:08] <A_Nonny_Mouse> and I dont want it to just be a drop down
[13:11:21] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Id like something more pyramidal?
[13:11:30] <A_Nonny_Mouse> like a TREE tree
[13:11:40] <A_Nonny_Mouse> masonry?
[13:11:47] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Ill check it out right now
[13:11:49] <duch_kazatel> then you want canvas probably.  there are some folks here that are good with that.
[13:11:59] <duch_kazatel> masonry is good for rectangular layouts
[13:12:32] <jParkton> lolwut?
[13:12:35] <jParkton> anonymoose?
[13:12:55] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Hrmm
[13:12:59] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Canvas
[13:13:08] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Ill look at that as well!
[13:13:11] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Thank you
[13:13:20] <jParkton> or racket
[13:13:21] <duch_kazatel> have you seen an example of wtf you're trying to do?
[13:13:23] <jParkton> sceme
[13:13:25] <jParkton> lol
[13:15:04] <A_Nonny_Mouse> Lol :P I'm sure I have somewhere
[13:15:22] <A_Nonny_Mouse> I've got it drawn out on my office wall and on paper
[13:15:31] <jParkton> nice
[13:15:37] <duch_kazatel> welp
[13:17:10] <wfq> Is there anyway that a form is not completely validated as true until further check up has been done when using jquery.validate? That further checkup is done when clicking on the submit button. That shouldn't be that difficult. I am not familiar at all with jquery.validate and before I strip the whole code I just want to explore this possibility
[13:17:24] <duch_kazatel> "checkup"?
[13:17:45] <wfq> When validate is run () it alerts of some errors but the form won't be completely valid until further validation has been done via submit event
[13:17:46] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to validate only on click?
[13:17:49] <wfq> that's all I need
[13:18:09] <duch_kazatel> so you need to validate with data that you're returning?
[13:18:58] <jParkton> isnt there a validation plugin?
[13:19:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah, jquery.validate
[13:19:09] <jParkton> oh
[13:19:11] <duch_kazatel> but his question doesn't really make sense to me.
[13:19:16] <duch_kazatel> trying to understand wtf he's trying to do.
[13:19:17] <wfq> duch_kazatel don't know what you mean. I am just trying to validate something that else at the submit time because it can't don on the fly
[13:19:20] <jParkton> I think it is the lingo barrier
[13:19:22] <jParkton> :)
[13:19:50] <duch_kazatel> wfq try to explain what you want without using technicaly words.
[13:19:53] <duch_kazatel> *techical
[13:19:56] <wfq> ok
[13:19:59] <wfq> let's me try
[13:20:56] <jParkton> I think he means I want to validate the form but after it is submitted only
[13:20:57] <wfq> I have a very messy code from someone. This guy is using jquery validate to validate the form. The problem is that some fields require some more complex validation. I am trying to do that via the submit event
[13:21:06] <wfq> but what is the problem? Let me explain
[13:21:10] <jParkton> lol
[13:21:59] <wfq> the validate function runs before my submit event obviously. The form is valid according to the defined rules so it is hiding all error labels that the submit event created
[13:22:20] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:22:22] <wfq> the solution is to make sure that the validate function do not return true until my further cheks are done
[13:22:36] <duch_kazatel> wait are you adding more validation yourself?
[13:22:37] <wfq> somehow like hold on until you get the rerturn of the submit method
[13:22:42] <duch_kazatel> and doing it outside of jquery validate?
[13:22:57] <wfq> Yes
[13:23:05] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[13:23:18] <wfq> because I have no idea how to do inside
[13:23:22] <wfq> have tried 1000 things
[13:23:24] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea.
[13:23:28] <wfq> I know
[13:23:28] <duch_kazatel> read the docs.
[13:23:35] <wfq> that is the question I am trying to ask :).
[13:23:48] <duch_kazatel> okay - what are you adding?
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> what does the submit to the server have to do with anything?
[13:23:57] <wfq> that example doesn't work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5252373/jquery-validate-rule-only-at-submit
[13:24:09] <wfq> absolutely nothing
[13:24:19] <duch_kazatel> okay.  so you're adding validation rules?
[13:24:20] <wfq> when the form is submit further validation is done
[13:24:29] <wfq> but no simple ones
[13:24:34] <wfq> not simple such required or number
[13:24:43] <duch_kazatel> you can define your own validators.
[13:24:50] <wfq> it is more complex than that. Thy are semantic rules
[13:24:51] <duch_kazatel> *rules
[13:25:06] <duch_kazatel> doesn't change my response - you can do custom validators.
[13:25:08] <wfq> 7.0 is float number but it may no make sense at all however 6.99 yes
[13:25:25] <duch_kazatel> that's legit.
[13:26:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8NCmf/1/ -> you can define your own validators just fine.
[13:26:51] <duch_kazatel> don't do additional validation outside of jquery validate.  either rip it all out and roll your own, or do everything inside of it.
[13:28:20] <wfq> right I get that I need to add custom validation within validate. But what about if the validation of those custom methods is to be done only when the user press thes ubmit. How do I do that please?
[13:28:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryvalidation.org/valid/
[13:29:16] <duch_kazatel> after you call .validate() to init everything, you can call .valid() to tell you if all is well.
[13:29:52] <duch_kazatel> do you want to submit the whole form via ajax?
[13:30:18] <wfq> no
[13:30:23] <wfq> but I think I get the idea
[13:30:26] <wfq> thanks a lot
[13:31:23] <duch_kazatel> kay
[13:31:26] <wfq> the steps are now clear: I add as many custom validation as I need within validate to make sure that the form make sense from a semantic point of view and then use valid() to make sure that the form is really valid
[13:31:50] <wfq> because I can guess that the custom added methods won't be triggered until I call valid()
[13:31:53] <duch_kazatel> or use the submitHandler() instead.
[13:32:08] <duch_kazatel> custom added ones can work like normal ones.
[13:32:21] <wfq> ok got it
[13:32:29] <wfq> thank you very much duch_kazatel
[13:32:34] <duch_kazatel> that's what that extra rules: bit is all about.
[13:34:15] <duch_kazatel> using my example from before: <input required type="text" name="zipCode" id="zipCode" /> for that custom one should work fine.
[13:35:09] <antlong> what do i need to use to remove  all objects that contains a specified property from a large obj
[13:35:35] <djQuery_> ?remove
[13:35:41] <duch_kazatel> enumerate over the properties, look for the objects with that prop, and go to town.
[13:35:53] <duch_kazatel> though "remove" is a shaky thing - why are you removing them?
[13:36:16] <antlong> the main object is being returned to a view, so if they have a property, i need to filter them
[13:36:35] <djQuery_> wtf when did we get an ends with?
[13:37:19] <duch_kazatel> antlong okay
[13:37:45] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete
[13:38:50] <antlong> thank you
[13:55:33] <AnTi_MTtr> has anyone ever tried to do a jquery sliding caption with a div
[13:55:37] <AnTi_MTtr> instead of an img element
[13:55:52] <AnTi_MTtr> seems like a lot of the caption libs are <img> tag oriented
[13:56:11] <AnTi_MTtr> so if you're using css background-image properties instead, you dont have a lot of options
[13:57:26] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a marquee or something?
[13:57:43] <AnTi_MTtr> duch_kazatel: for example, take this caption librarY: http://captionjs.com/
[13:57:55] <AnTi_MTtr> if you look at its examples it uses the <img > tag to create the caption
[13:58:19] <AnTi_MTtr> since i have no img tag i need one ehtat works with a div element
[13:58:23] <AnTi_MTtr> instead of an img element
[13:58:38] <duch_kazatel> should be pretty easy.
[13:59:04] <duch_kazatel> look at the rendered html.
[13:59:29] <AnTi_MTtr> its an img tag with the -data-caption option set
[13:59:38] <duch_kazatel> that's not the rendered HTML.
[13:59:49] <duch_kazatel> rendered HTML is different than the HTML you see there.
[14:00:04] <AnTi_MTtr> where do you see rendered html?
[14:00:10] <duch_kazatel> your inspector.
[14:00:14] <AnTi_MTtr> i am
[14:00:18] <AnTi_MTtr> im looking at the html in firebug
[14:00:27] <AnTi_MTtr> and i see an img tag with the -data-caption option set
[14:00:30] <duch_kazatel> notice the figure tag and figcaption?
[14:00:41] <AnTi_MTtr> yeah some tag called figcaption
[14:00:49] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[14:00:50] <AnTi_MTtr> with an itemprop option
[14:01:08] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh ok
[14:01:15] <AnTi_MTtr> so you're saying if i just use those elements in my div
[14:01:16] <duch_kazatel> you can ignore the prop and type - the figure tag and its styling are the important bits.
[14:01:17] <AnTi_MTtr> it hsould load
[14:01:20] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:01:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying you can replicate what that plugin does by doing to divs what they're doing to IMGs.
[14:02:23] <AnTi_MTtr> i see
[14:02:38] <AnTi_MTtr> so the <figcaption> tag, ive never seen that, is that html5?
[14:02:57] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption
[14:02:58] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:03:06] <duch_kazatel> `mdn figure
[14:03:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: <figure> - HTML | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure
[14:04:00] <AnTi_MTtr> can i get around using the figure element?
[14:04:03] <AnTi_MTtr> i need these to be divs
[14:04:24] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[14:04:28] <duch_kazatel> you could use other elements.
[14:04:30] <duch_kazatel> same basic concept.
[14:04:36] <duch_kazatel> the <figcaption> is the important part.
[14:04:39] <duch_kazatel> and the styling used.
[14:05:40] <AnTi_MTtr> hmm
[14:06:22] <AnTi_MTtr> ok so any hints on what jquery id use to hid/show the <figcaption> element?
[14:06:32] <AnTi_MTtr> or div
[14:06:36] <AnTi_MTtr> it can be a div right?
[14:06:50] <duch_kazatel> you can't use figcaption without the figure tag.
[14:06:52] <AnTi_MTtr> i dont see why not if im writing the js by hand anyways
[14:06:58] <duch_kazatel> you can use any tag.
[14:06:59] <AnTi_MTtr> yeah thats what im saying, i cant use a figure
[14:07:09] <AnTi_MTtr> ok so i can use a div, gotcha
[14:08:29] <AnTi_MTtr> duch_kazatel: so what would be a good as far as the jquery goes
[14:08:39] <TheSin> quick question on $.ajax, in data: { } I have a json string I want to pass to my php script, but php is getting it already decoded, how can I stop the auto decode?
[14:08:40] <AnTi_MTtr> some sort of sliding fx
[14:09:38] <duch_kazatel> AnTi_MTtr append an element to the parent container, positioning it so it's bottom aligned.
[14:09:39] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[14:09:44] <decx> just write the 5 lines it takes to display a caption block after you mouseover your div
[14:10:21] <duch_kazatel> or do that.
[14:10:22] <AnTi_MTtr> duch_kazatel: yup thats straight forward
[14:10:23] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[14:10:28] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/decx/aX9Yd/
[14:10:47] <AnTi_MTtr> that looks great
[14:10:54] <AnTi_MTtr> just need to modify it to use one of those fancy fxs'
[14:10:58] <AnTi_MTtr> let me see
[14:11:27] <AnTi_MTtr> http://api.jquery.com/slideup/
[14:11:29] <AnTi_MTtr> something like that
[14:11:50] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[14:12:04] <blakespot> How do I scroll a certain # of pixels down page without animate - just instantly (jump)?
[14:13:09] <duch_kazatel> blakespot $('html, body') scrolltop()
[14:13:14] <duch_kazatel> or use a normal anchor
[14:15:10] <joephilly> hey nerds
[14:15:55] <duch_kazatel> welp
[14:16:16] <blakespot> duch_kazatel: I need to scroll down the page x # of pixels tho
[14:16:32] <joephilly> I'm using jquery 1.4.4 and opening a dialog whilst preventing a submit buttons click behavior. Then when I call .click or even trigger('click') it doesn't seem to be triggering. Any ideas why?
[14:16:36] <duch_kazatel> blakespot http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/#scrollTop-value
[14:16:40] <duch_kazatel> use scrollTop()
[14:16:51] <duch_kazatel> joephilly why are you still using 1.4.4?
[14:17:04] <joephilly> duch_kazatel, because thats what this website uses
[14:17:31] <duch_kazatel> welp
[14:17:55] <sweet2k4> anyone know if .prop isnt working with jquery.js?ver=1.11.0?
[14:18:11] <duch_kazatel> either way, you're preventing default and then trying to CLICK.
[14:18:49] <joephilly> yeah. how long will preventDefault prevent?
[14:18:59] <duch_kazatel> always
[14:19:09] <duch_kazatel> you can see if the click was synthetically triggered or not, though.
[14:22:20] <blakespot> tnx
[14:22:30] <joephilly> hmm
[14:22:40] <joephilly> well the preventDefault goes away the next time I clickt he button by hand
[14:22:45] <joephilly> so tis not forever
[14:23:49] <duch_kazatel> then you're removing that handler somehow.
[14:24:23] <joephilly> well.... I dont think so
[14:26:41] <joephilly> i would assume preventDefault just prevents for hte duration of that operation
[14:27:37] <duch_kazatel> !paste

[14:31:15] * RandalSchwartz waves at the channel
[14:31:25] <AnTi_MTtr> the only part im having trouble iwth is how to create the caption div slide out, then slide it in
[14:31:38] <AnTi_MTtr> right now it just kidna pops in
[14:31:38] <RandalSchwartz> my dart SPA has suddenly become a jquery SPA :)
[14:31:54] <RandalSchwartz> since dart isn't quite ready
[14:36:56] <decx> AnTi_MTtr well you can always go mental http://jsfiddle.net/decx/TVXx8/14
[14:38:42] <Eiam> whenever I see people do stuff like var $blah, is that some kind of shorthand for var blah = $('blah'); ?
[14:39:09] <Eiam> or are they just for some weird reason naming a variable with a $?
[14:39:15] <decx> it's just something to rmember that it's jquery related
[14:39:41] <AnTi_MTtr> decx: wow you did that allw ith css alone
[14:39:43] <Eiam> ? I'm having trouble locating what it does..
[14:39:43] <AnTi_MTtr> thats pretty cool
[14:39:45] <decx> i don't like all the $ it pollutes the codepicture
[14:40:02] <Eiam> so; whats it do?
[14:40:28] <decx> AnTi_MTtr content: attr(); can get attributes, it's not old ie safe but of course more efficient than a css solution
[14:40:40] <decx> Eiam it does nothing
[14:40:49] <AnTi_MTtr> decx: does that have pretty good browser support?
[14:40:58] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh
[14:40:58] <Eiam> so its no different from var blah;
[14:41:09] <Eiam> OH
[14:41:11] <Eiam> i see what you mean
[14:41:16] <decx> var $blah = $('.mything'); var blah = document.querySelectorAll('.mything')
[14:41:18] <Eiam> it means like the object chains you are dealing with are jquery
[14:41:20] <antlong> whats the best way to time a function in console? I need the time code in the html
[14:41:25] <antlong> timer*
[14:41:42] <Eiam> decx: ys I was more trying to understand if the $blah was *doing* anything with the $
[14:41:44] <decx> yeah it's like a visual clue, this isnt a native object or a string or whatever
[14:41:46] <Eiam> and i see what you mean now. Its a reminder to the user
[14:41:49] <Eiam> right i got it, okay
[14:41:56] <Eiam> thats interesting never seen that befoer
[14:42:01] <Eiam> thank you
[14:42:03] <decx> it's pretty common
[14:42:09] <Eiam> I guess not in our code base =)
[14:42:14] <decx> but purely cosmetic
[14:42:17] <Eiam> (it confuses me, clearly hah)
[14:43:56] <decx> antlong https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console.time
[14:45:11] <joephilly> is there a way I can get jquery dialog to block?
[14:47:01] <joephilly> I know the answer is no. Not sure why I even ask
[14:48:05] <decx> block?
[14:48:38] <antlong> i just keep getting undefined
[14:48:45] <joephilly> ugh. stupid webforms
[14:49:04] <joephilly> I cant just submit the form. I have to actually call the click on the button. lame
[14:55:58] <frank_o> When emulating say the iPhone 5 from Chrome dev tools, why am I getting 1700px from `$(window).height();`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ebkeq/embedded/result/
[14:57:48] <djQuery_> joephilly, what do you mean?
[14:59:30] <djQuery_> decx, I like making my vars with $x = $('somefilter')
[14:59:45] <djQuery_> lets me remember later that its a jquery object
[15:00:07] <RandalSchwartz> I think the thing I'm most amazed at right now with jquery is that I can generate data-foo="bar" items for an option-select input, and pick those out as meta data for the selected itmes.
[15:01:02] <djQuery_> RandalSchwartz, you can do that for any item
[15:01:07] <RandalSchwartz> ... $(':input[name=the_input] :selected').map(function () { return $(this).data('foo') }
[15:01:09] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[15:01:35] <RandalSchwartz> it took me a while to sort out how I was going to do that.
[15:01:56] <djQuery_> heck people have been adding custom attributes to elems a long time before jquery
[15:01:58] <RandalSchwartz> $client wanted clientside button to do something with data derived from selected items.
[15:02:15] <RandalSchwartz> well - I'm still a bit new to client-side programming
[15:02:27] <djQuery_> 1999 here
[15:02:41] <duch_kazatel> but data-* is now officially kosher.
[15:02:45] <duch_kazatel> just don't select on them :)
[15:02:47] <joephilly> RandalSchwartz, you're the git guy, aren't ya?
[15:03:00] <RandalSchwartz> git and perl and floss weekly yeah
[15:04:44] <joephilly> RandalSchwartz, congrats on having nice teeth
[15:06:33] <frank_o> decx: you dont prefer $ in your vars right?
[15:07:05] * RandalSchwartz . o O (nice teeth?)
[15:07:07] <frank_o> if it really doesnt matter id rather not have them
[15:07:11] <decx> i dont
[15:07:15] <frank_o> cool
[15:07:20] <RandalSchwartz> oh... twit.tv/floss - my podcast
[15:08:44] <joephilly> RandalSchwartz, oh. I just remember talking to you in #git 2 years ago and you helping me. Now i'm the team's git expert :p
[15:09:06] <joephilly> I remember watching a presentation explaining some things about git and that helped a lot
[15:15:49] <wfq> afda
[15:16:00] <AnTi_MTtr> decx: that css caption you showed me, is there a way to have it not appear if there is not caption= option in the parent div?
[15:16:48] <AnTi_MTtr> maybe ill just add a caption class to the div
[15:17:19] <RandalSchwartz> here's my updated git talk - https://vimeo.com/35778382
[15:17:26] <RandalSchwartz> it expands on the one I did as a google tech talk
[15:19:32] <wfq> the most difficult yet. Is there anyway of getting the errorPlacement customed for a particular rule only?
[15:19:38] <wfq> in jquery.validate
[15:20:35] <wfq> I can guess I just need to check within the errorReplacement function what element is
[15:21:25] <decx> AnTi_MTtr i dont know what you mean, caption option?
[15:22:01] <AnTi_MTtr> ok i got it
[15:22:07] <AnTi_MTtr> i just used a secondary class
[15:22:37] <AnTi_MTtr> that was much easier than trying to do it in js
[15:22:44] <AnTi_MTtr> but i hope its doesnt break on ie9
[15:26:02] <antlong> object.filter(function(v) is giving me two different results on the page vs in console, are there pitfalls with using this?
[15:27:50] <decx> are you loggin inside the filter function?
[15:30:33] <antlong> i was just reading what was in console, decx
[15:31:07] <antlong> basically i assign the original var to the result of the filter, but all of the items are showing up
[15:34:30] <wfq> how do I custom as well the error label to be shown as part of the error message when using jquery validate. Please see that I mean the label element itself and not the message
[15:34:55] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you can, but i might be wrong.
[15:35:47] <decx> when in doubt add a class
[15:36:12] <wfq> oh god this is killing me...
[15:36:26] <duch_kazatel> wfq why do you need to change the element?
[15:36:27] <decx> label.error { normal } .myinterestinginput + label.error { custom style }
[15:38:03] <wfq> duch_kazatel, when I click a the button of the form I show the label error by using a custom method somewhere else rather than next to the object. However that label must disappear on an onchange event otherwise will confuse the user
[15:38:32] <duch_kazatel> are you still doing that thing where you're validating outside of your validator?
[15:38:35] <wfq> decx, sorry I mean the label element for a particular rule only. Is that possible?
[15:38:53] <wfq> duch_kazatel no. I am doing it within the validate method
[15:39:32] <duch_kazatel> then your statement doesn't make sense.  mind explaining without technical talk again? ;)\
[15:39:38] <decx> just add a class to the input you want to style a custom error label for
[15:39:48] <duch_kazatel> wait that's all they want to do?
[15:40:03] <decx> with .class + label.error you can then apply a style to the label element after that class
[15:40:19] <wfq> decx, I am with you in one sec
[15:40:28] <decx> no
[15:41:32] <wfq> duch_kazatel when clicking on the form button a rule is triggered.  But if the user goes to that element and try to type soemthing that label must disappear until the button is clicked again, should an invalid input be provided again
[15:42:58] <wfq> the guys who wrote this piece of shit has an onchange event added out of the validate method
[15:43:39] <duch_kazatel> wfq uh
[15:43:50] <wfq> let's suppose the following
[15:43:56] <duch_kazatel> wfq i'm using that plugin, to problem.
[15:43:58] <duch_kazatel> soooo..
[15:44:19] <wfq> I am not talking about the jquery.validate code :)
[15:44:33] <wfq> but the guy who wrote the code I am dealing with
[15:44:43] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[15:44:49] <wfq> sorry getting back to the my example
[15:45:11] <duch_kazatel> you know that jquery validate should automatically do what you want, right?
[15:45:52] <wfq> I have an amount that when clicking on the submit button it will show an error saying that the amount is required should this field have not been provided.However when the user try to amend it the error should disappear until the submit button is clicked again to re-validate it
[15:46:38] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2086287/how-to-clear-jquery-validation-error-messages
[15:47:08] <djQuery_> google + stackoverflow is always win
[15:47:32] <wfq> no way
[15:48:36] <duch_kazatel> yes way
[15:48:41] <wfq> I was trying to follow the guy who coded this. I think I should have stopped hours ago and go back to the documentation and rewrite everything. I was lazy when I thought about it about I would have avoided hours of silly questions, swearing at him and plenty of tirenes
[15:49:07] <wfq> *sencond about = but
[15:49:51] <djQuery_> wfq, sounds like you could just put that in a focus event for you field
[15:50:32] <djQuery_> well unless it is automagicaly focusing the first field with an error
[15:50:36] <wfq> in the other hand, resetForm will wipe out all the errors in the form I can guess
[15:50:58] <antlong> http://jsfiddle.net/3Q7R4/ line 11 is working in my console, and only returning one match. on my site, 56 objects appear in the ui.
[15:52:18] <wfq> duch_kazatel that example is for an extra button "cancel". I shall pull that thread
[15:53:25] <decx> wfq same principle http://jsfiddle.net/decx/DtL57/
[15:56:48] <wfq> thanks decx.
[15:57:31] <wfq> you are using html5 here aren't you?
[15:58:29] <decx> the + selector works back to ie7
[15:58:32] <djQuery_> wfq, looks like he is some
[15:58:37] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:00:21] <wfq> Thanks guys for your input. I am going to re-structure the whole code. This guy's code is laughable
[16:00:50] <wfq> do you want to laugh a little bit?
[16:01:29] <wfq> let's laugh. I am going to show you some code that this guy did
[16:01:40] <decx> please don't
[16:01:51] <djQuery_> what I dont like about that example is if you dont fill out a field it places your cursor in the field hiding the error message for the field
[16:02:20] <wfq> here we go: http://pastebin.com/Kk9R24Jh
[16:02:46] <wfq> don't tell me that this guy should not have been shot dead right after he did that sausage :)
[16:03:02] <decx> like i'm gonna read all that
[16:03:31] <wfq> decx, ha. I don't want you to but don't you think that by the look of it is just laughable?
[16:04:35] <wfq> how on earth can someone who is developing for mayor corporation do such piece of s***
[16:06:58] <djQuery_> dang Stan Lee is getting old
[16:07:43] <decx> maybe you're getting old, but stan lee has been old for 25 years
[16:09:11] <djQuery_> im only 14
[16:11:22] <decx> after 1 it's all downhill
[16:15:30] <jParkton> lol 1
[16:15:38] <jParkton> nursing ftw!
[16:16:01] <djQuery_> once you don't have someone to wipe your ass anymore
[16:24:55] <kitikonti> hi everyone
[16:27:32] <wfq> how do you wipe out a textbox when a particular selectbox choice is taken with validate? I mean for the same fields you can use focusCleanUp:true? Should this be done out of the validate?
[17:15:49] <jParkton> https://gist.github.com/jparkton/ba19a7310f2e1bd9f60c
[17:16:15] <jParkton> For some reason I cant do innerHTML = name[map]
[17:16:23] <jParkton> is there a way to do it?
[17:16:33] <jParkton> HTML()
[17:16:37] <jParkton> I dunno
[17:18:37] <duch_kazatel> .html() is the jquery method.
[17:18:47] <duch_kazatel> if you want to just to text, .text() is what you want.
[17:25:03] <jParkton> ah
[17:25:06] <jParkton> ty dutch
[17:25:15] <jParkton> why doesnt using innerHTML work?
[17:25:23] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[17:25:28] <duch_kazatel> and what are you running it against?
[17:25:42] <duch_kazatel> because it should work just fine.
[17:26:31] <jParkton> https://github.com/jparkton/firebaseLogin/blob/master/libs/js/main.js
[17:26:38] <jParkton> that is what I am doing
[17:26:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't see where you're using it.
[17:27:11] <jParkton> but how do I make my logo name[map]
[17:27:33] <jParkton> https://github.com/jparkton/firebaseLogin/blob/master/libs/js/main.js#L38
[17:27:40] <duch_kazatel> okay, first up, var name= [ "jParkton" ]; this doesn't make sense.
[17:27:53] <jParkton> its an array
[17:27:55] <jParkton> lol
[17:27:59] <jParkton> slim
[17:28:01] <duch_kazatel> right - why?
[17:28:09] <jParkton> just to hold something
[17:28:17] <duch_kazatel> that you don't use?
[17:28:27] <jParkton> no
[17:28:37] <jParkton> I want to make var map = user.id
[17:28:47] <jParkton> then use that ID to name[map]
[17:28:53] <jParkton> om
[17:28:59] <jParkton> I understand now
[17:29:01] <duch_kazatel> if you want map to be a number, use parseInt()
[17:29:06] <duch_kazatel> not Number()
[17:29:11] <jParkton> okk
[17:29:17] <jParkton> but also
[17:29:23] <jParkton> there is a flaw in my logic
[17:29:24] <jParkton> lol
[17:29:26] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:29:34] <duch_kazatel> you only have name[0] available.
[17:29:39] <jParkton> yeah
[17:29:46] <jParkton> so map - 1?
[17:30:05] <jParkton> mycurrent id is 1 the next will be two and the index will need to be 1
[17:30:18] <duch_kazatel> but why do you need the array at all?
[17:30:36] <duch_kazatel> or is this just for testing.
[17:30:39] <jParkton> just to hold usernames for a minute
[17:30:43] <jParkton> yeah tot est
[17:30:54] <duch_kazatel> okay - then you need to -1 if the user.id is off by one.
[17:31:23] <jParkton> ok so var map = parseint(user.id - 1);?
[17:31:39] <systemfault> o_O
[17:31:40] <duch_kazatel> parseInt(user.id - 1, 10)
[17:32:01] <duch_kazatel> but this whole exercize is kind of strange - why not return a user object instead?
[17:32:05] <systemfault> That line doesn’t make much sense to me… substracting 1 from a strinf
[17:32:08] <systemfault> string
[17:32:09] <duch_kazatel> you're not exposing all your users via js, are you?
[17:32:27] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah, it'd be parseInt(user.id, 10) - 1
[17:32:45] <duch_kazatel> a little too much workbeer today.
[17:32:49] <jParkton> lol
[17:32:57] <jParkton> only for the moment
[17:33:17] <jParkton> once I get the basic stuff working correct I will make it connect to a database of some type
[17:33:25] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[17:33:30] <duch_kazatel> that's a strange way to work.
[17:33:41] <jParkton> I am strange
[17:33:56] <jParkton> as long as I learn something and get better is all I am after
[17:33:57] <jParkton> lol
[17:34:15] <duch_kazatel> that's the issue though - you're picking up some bad habits >.>
[17:34:32] <jParkton> ok
[17:34:37] <jParkton> how should I do it?
[17:34:45] <duch_kazatel> build out back to front imo.
[17:35:19] <duch_kazatel> start with the backend, and then build out the frontend.  when you find something else you need for the frontent, add it.
[17:35:34] <jParkton> I dont know how
[17:35:43] <duch_kazatel> that's why you start.
[17:35:45] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:35:57] <jParkton> ok what do I need
[17:36:02] <jParkton> the database I reckon
[17:36:03] <duch_kazatel> what are you building?
[17:36:08] <jParkton> who knows
[17:36:10] <jParkton> lol
[17:36:16] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[17:36:25] <jParkton> Im just logging in a user and changing the view
[17:36:34] <jParkton> based on login
[17:36:47] <duch_kazatel> then it's hard to suggest anything.  you could use postgres, mysql, mssql, mongo, couch....
[17:37:04] <jParkton> firebase has my users
[17:37:11] <jParkton> but there is no name
[17:37:39] <duch_kazatel> btw firebase IS your data store.
[17:38:09] <ozcan7778> hey guys how can i pass this variable into inner scope? http://pastebin.com/2DQ5BTX9
[17:38:33] <duch_kazatel> ozcan7778 where is names defined?
[17:38:42] <jParkton> so how do I map my user.id to my firebase.io/users and map that to a different view?
[17:38:43] <duch_kazatel> is it within another function?
[17:38:56] <duch_kazatel> jParkton dunno - that's something you need to ask in a firebase channel ;)
[17:38:57] <ozcan7778> no just behind these lines
[17:39:03] <jParkton> they never respond
[17:39:12] <jParkton> too busy doing cool shit I assume
[17:39:22] <duch_kazatel> jParkton this is a channel for jquery, so you won't get much firebase help here.
[17:39:37] <duch_kazatel> ozcan7778 try to console.log(names) instead.
[17:39:38] <jParkton> so why is it being discussed
[17:39:39] <jParkton> nerd
[17:39:46] <duch_kazatel> jParkton huh?
[17:39:49] <jParkton> lol
[17:40:07] <duch_kazatel> not a great way to get help ;)
[17:40:36] <duch_kazatel> ozcan7778 jquery has function level scope and supports closures.  any var in a scope exists in all child scopes, as well.
[17:41:49] <sc_> but not parents!
[17:41:54] <ozcan7778> duch_kazatel: but first console.log prints as is, in a child jquery scope prints undefined. makes no sense
[17:43:08] <jParkton> duch_kazatel: it was a yolk
[17:43:25] <duch_kazatel> ozcan7778 then you're breaking out of scope.
[17:45:30] <duch_kazatel> ozcan7778 can you setup a jsfiddle of what you're doing?
[17:46:12] <ozcan7778> duch_kazatel: yes i am going to try

[23:51:31] <trwww> I'm trying to figure out how to pass additional parameters to $.each when iterating over an object.

[23:51:40] <trwww> but if I change the array to an object: http://jsfiddle.net/Arbe3/1/
[23:51:51] <trwww> I can't figure out how to get the key from the key/value pair. Any advice?
