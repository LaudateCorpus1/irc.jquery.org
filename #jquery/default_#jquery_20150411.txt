[04:04:06] <lionrouge> hi
[04:04:24] <lionrouge> may i save a result of jQuery selector to an array and use it later?
[04:04:42] <lionrouge> may i insert this result in another selectors?
[04:05:03] <arthurvr> lionrouge: I don‚Äôt know exactly how you mean that. Mind doing a fiddle/jsbin?
[04:05:17] <lionrouge> ok
[04:11:57] <lionrouge> arthurvr, smth. like this: https://jsfiddle.net/tcdy5o75/4/
[04:15:15] <arthurvr> lionrouge: that should work, but you used your ids wrong. The selector is  basically wrong in this example.
[04:15:41] <lionrouge> why?
[04:17:20] <arthurvr> lionrouge: The sign `#` selects the element with the ID of ‚Ä¶
[04:17:29] <arthurvr> lionrouge: and your elements have id=‚Äù#b‚Äù
[04:17:40] <arthurvr> why the selector would select id="b"
[04:18:13] <arthurvr> lionrouge: if the id in the html is correct, you need a second `#` in your selector
[04:18:16] <arthurvr> like this: https://jsfiddle.net/tcdy5o75/5/
[04:18:22] <lionrouge> oh, i see
[04:18:29] <lionrouge> a really stupid mistake
[04:18:53] <lionrouge> thank you
[04:58:38] <jop008> anyone advice on a good date picker?
[04:59:10] <arthurvr> jop008: do you need some feature in specific?
[04:59:32] <jop008> only valid dates in format dd-mm-yyyy
[05:00:10] <jop008> so no leeters and only in thsi format
[05:00:10] <jop008> This one is not doing what I want http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.1/datepicker/
[05:00:48] <arthurvr> why doesn‚Äôt it?
[05:01:34] <arthurvr> There are many datepickers out there but the jquery ui one is generally a good choice lol
[05:01:36] <jop008> try it
[05:01:40] <jop008> it wont work
[05:01:57] <jop008> you can fill in 1331 and leave the field for example
[05:02:44] <arthurvr> jop008: That‚Äôs validation, has nothing to do with the datepicker itself lol
[05:02:52] <arthurvr> jop008: but if you want that it‚Äôs possible.
[05:03:09] <jop008> valid dates I want immedeately good dates
[05:03:34] <jop008> so not after form send after field update I want good dates whatever you call it
[05:05:17] <jop008> how is this possible?
[05:05:41] <arthurvr> jop008: just use html5 validation therefor lol
[05:06:04] <jop008> but html5 is not working in all browsers
[05:07:15] <arthurvr> jop008: as I said also just try jQuery UI.
[05:07:17] <arthurvr> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[05:07:38] <arthurvr> but using that other one it‚Äôd be possible though but don‚Äôt have time to explain
[05:08:50] <jop008> but you can fill in 1341 It must work well on mobile devices as well
[05:11:24] <bepolite> just curious, jop008  which date do you want "1341" to be
[05:11:41] <arthurvr> yeah I guess you just want it to block something like that huh?
[05:13:06] <hissz00n> hello everybody
[05:13:12] <hissz00n> I've got a problem
[05:13:17] <hissz00n> who can help me please?
[05:13:23] <bepolite> hissz00n: just ask
[05:13:32] <arthurvr> ?ask @ hissz00n
[05:13:32] <b-ot> hissz00n: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:13:44] <hissz00n> bepolite: arthurvr: thank you
[05:13:45] <jop008> 1351 is an invalid date
[05:13:58] <jop008> the user is not allowed to fill this like that
[05:14:29] <hissz00n> jop008:sorry for jumping in late? You just want to validate a datepicker or what was your question?
[05:15:06] <hissz00n> html5 input[type="date"] is nt it?
[05:15:16] <hissz00n> anyways my question
[05:15:23] <hissz00n> you want to see the code?
[05:15:28] <arthurvr> ?paste @ hissz00n
[05:15:28] <b-ot> hissz00n: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:15:31] <jop008> validate a date so user can fill in dates in format dd-mm-yyyy and not anythign else
[05:15:47] <hissz00n> jop008: uh that's just a regex isn't it
[05:16:22] <jop008> I don't know it must have gui as well
[05:16:31] <jop008> datepicker with validation
[05:16:45] <hissz00n> jquery ui datepicker + regex sounds simple
[05:16:55] <arthurvr> hissz00n: he wanted something more mobile focussed
[05:17:09] <hissz00n> arthurvr: okay thanks
[05:18:00] <jop008> sounds simple but not to me :-(
[05:18:14] <hissz00n> my question is regarding animation. arthurvr: bepolite: are you guys willing to help?
[05:18:20] <arthurvr> yes we are!
[05:18:24] <jop008> so this one http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.1/datepicker/ with a regex?
[05:18:27] <arthurvr> at least I am lol
[05:18:29] <Uhkis> not simple with regex
[05:18:33] <jop008> regex after field lost focus
[05:18:42] <hissz00n> Uhkis: Why?
[05:18:57] <arthurvr> like the most common regex ever lol
[05:19:05] <hissz00n> ^ exactly.
[05:19:07] <Uhkis> because of ranges?
[05:19:20] <hissz00n> how would that be a problem?
[05:19:31] <jop008> but how to use it with a gui?
[05:20:29] <robmal> You are looking for a mask plugin.
[05:20:33] <jop008> I can;t find good examples
[05:20:48] <jop008> if that how you call it :-)
[05:20:52] <hissz00n> jop008: after my question I'll write something up for you
[05:20:55] <robmal> http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/
[05:21:00] <Uhkis> hissz00n: do tell a simple regex for month only?
[05:21:53] <jop008> Good tip sounds good !
[05:23:35] <hissz00n> so this is what I've got. http://jsbin.com/majocofaqu/1/edit?js,output try hovering fast. I don't want them to repeat :(
[05:23:53] <arthurvr> yup every time you hover over them they end up in the queue of that element, without the queue getting cleared or stopped.
[05:24:16] <arthurvr> fairly easy to fix but I recently rewrote the queues article on learn.jquery.com so I'm going to redirect you to there lol
[05:24:27] <arthurvr> there you go sir http://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[05:25:01] <hissz00n> oh well arthurvr that's quite awesome
[05:25:08] <hissz00n> thanks for the hint
[05:25:11] <hissz00n> reading up on it now
[05:25:20] <hissz00n> I didn't even know it existed
[05:25:41] <hissz00n> is it handy for other things then that?
[05:25:45] <arthurvr> sure it is
[05:25:49] <arthurvr> read the article hint hint
[05:25:59] <hissz00n> haha will do will do
[05:26:05] <hissz00n> thanks for your help
[05:26:18] <adv_> how can i apply an id to an img ?
[05:26:36] <arthurvr> adv_: let me create a fiddle for you :)
[05:26:36] <Uhkis> ?api attr @ adv_
[05:26:36] <b-ot> adv_: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[05:26:43] <arthurvr> oh well there you go
[05:27:23] <adv_> well i know which img it is, i just want to patch it with an id
[05:27:36] <hissz00n> it's element.id so you should use jQuery().prop isn't it?
[05:27:51] <arthurvr> hissz00n: Id is a tricky one but Uhkis was correct.
[05:27:52] <Uhkis> http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2 to be exact
[05:28:22] <hissz00n> arthurvr: in what way tricky?
[05:28:44] <arthurvr> go google lol
[05:28:54] <hissz00n> I already found an article about it. Thanksszzzz
[05:29:54] <hissz00n> Thanks for the stunning article btw arthurvr. Issue fixed.
[05:29:55] * bepolite wonders why people use "google" instead of "search"
[05:30:42] <arthurvr> `to google` is officially accepted as a verb in the english language lol
[05:30:42] <Uhkis> because duckduckgo is terribly slow to type vs. google
[05:31:11] <arthurvr> basically because nobody uses other things than google isn‚Äôt it
[05:31:30] <hissz00n> yeah guess that's why
[05:32:30] <Uhkis> a lot of people have switched to duckduckgo and others because googles ads and stuff
[05:32:55] <hissz00n> do you ever find useful stuff using ddgo? such a pain
[05:33:04] <hissz00n> plus google does much more for me than the search
[05:33:07] <Uhkis> s/people/foilhats/ maybe :D
[05:33:07] <bepolite> i use ddgo and Its awesome
[05:33:30] <bepolite> startpage is a great alternative too
[05:33:59] <hissz00n> Ones are less than the others but everything which isn't google is a pain IMHO
[05:34:00] <bepolite> "arthurvr> basically because nobody uses other things than google isnít it" Really
[05:35:09] <hissz00n> don't forget that we're like a super nerdy community but that the average people probably don't know what google does
[05:35:29] <arthurvr> the average people doesn‚Äôt hang out in here and the average grandmother uses IE6 lol
[05:35:59] <Uhkis> where does average grandma use IE6? :D
[05:36:05] <Uhkis> belgium?
[05:36:43] <arthurvr> lol I was overreacting. There are still countries where IE8 is like above 7% by the way
[05:36:50] <robmal> Neitherlands!
[05:37:00] <arthurvr> really?
[05:37:42] <hissz00n> what browser support do you guys do these days?
[05:37:50] <arthurvr> I never support IE anymore. Like at all not anymore. Latest version of all other browsers.
[05:38:23] <arthurvr> But I only work on development focussed site where IE total is like ~2%
[05:38:28] <Uhkis> around 2005 i made a redirect to firefox.com if user used IE on my page :D
[05:39:13] <hissz00n> these days safari is like the IE of a few years ago lol
[05:39:17] <arthurvr> Yeah
[05:39:44] <arthurvr> totally true. Everybody complains about IE but the amount of bugs safari had lately is like terrible
[05:40:13] <hissz00n> arthurvr: that's the reason of the latest jQuery patch release right?
[05:40:16] <arthurvr> yup
[05:42:29] <Uhkis> so what if safari bugs, get a real computer instead of a mac ;D
[05:43:38] <hissz00n> mac is like the only computers where you can do webdev on in a serious way isn't it
[05:43:44] <hissz00n> well yeah expect linux
[05:44:20] <hissz00n> and hey safari on windows is even worse
[05:44:30] <arthurvr> does that still exist wow
[05:44:35] <arthurvr> what‚Äôs the userbase these days
[05:44:46] <Uhkis> i think you can still get some very old version of it on windows
[05:45:11] <hissz00n> Uhkis: of what? Safari?
[05:45:36] <arthurvr> ha yeah it still exists
[05:45:42] <Uhkis> hissz00n: yes safari
[05:45:45] <arthurvr> o/
[05:48:15] <MeowZedong> hissz00n: Linux is a great way to develop, but if your work spills into 3D animation, movie editing, or Adobe anything, the preference would spill to Windows or Mac. More Mac mostly.
[05:48:29] <MeowZedong> hissz00n: but you can build a custom rig and run Windows, you cannot do that with Mac.
[05:49:07] <MeowZedong> you can build a custom rig that runs Linux too
[05:49:15] <hissz00n> why would i care about 3d animation haha
[05:49:27] <hissz00n> i'm a javascript developer
[05:49:34] <Uhkis> because webgl
[05:50:14] <hissz00n> good point
[05:51:21] <hissz00n> what browser do yall use for web dev work btw
[05:51:52] <arthurvr> opera and chrome mostly why?
[05:53:21] <hissz00n> arthuvr: interested just
[05:53:31] <arthurvr> okay
[05:59:56] <jop008> is there a clever way to determine a form is ditry meaning it has changes but not saved yet
[06:00:12] <jop008> when user navigates from page a warning should be given
[06:00:19] <arthurvr> depends on what you mean with ‚Äòsaved‚Äô
[06:00:44] <arthurvr> might use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload
[06:00:53] <arthurvr> though you can‚Äôt so stuff like window.alert and similar
[06:01:37] <jop008> saved in database
[06:02:01] <arthurvr> jop008: well yeah but how do you send it to that database lol? fiddle welcome.
[06:02:13] <jop008> the onbefore unload must detect pending changes
[06:02:38] <arthurvr> yeah but you cannot (or are very unlikely) to be able to save it then by eg. an ajax request
[06:02:57] <arthurvr> might use localstorage if you only don‚Äôt want the user to lose text
[06:07:09] <hissz00n> arthurvr: can I ask you another question?
[06:07:15] <arthurvr> ?ask
[06:07:15] <b-ot> arthurvr: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:07:38] <hissz00n> Uhkis: bepolite: or one of you maybe?
[06:09:24] <Verzlo> Hi, how would I loop through this json to display all results on the page, https://jsonblob.com/55291cdae4b0237a964c0de9. because $.each isn't doing it properly.. just showing [Object][object]
[06:10:12] <Verzlo> This is the script im using atm http://hastebin.com/apesarejat.js
[06:19:20] <bepolite> Verzlo: why don't you use dataType: 'json', in the ajax call
[06:22:10] <bepolite> Verzlo: which $each loop are you refering to
[06:22:22] <bepolite> I've tested your code and It works as expected for me
[06:23:37] <arthurvr> That said, nested loops which all do DOM manipulation after DOM ready. The worst performance ever. perf matters
[06:24:01] <arthurvr> anyways let‚Äôs focus on the actual problem
[06:24:15] <arthurvr> are you sure your server returns the right data?
[06:25:47] <bepolite> Also, you can't append a JSON object to a div $('#server-monitor').append(serverres);
[06:26:14] <arthurvr> that too lol
[06:26:45] <arthurvr> Verzlo: but if you fixed it please think about the performance of that snippet :)
[06:28:07] <adv_> how can i watch if background-size has changed in an img ?
[06:28:25] <adv_> i want to print 'foo' whenever there's a change
[06:28:33] <misutowolf> Hey guys, got a question.   I'm trying to select/manipulate some DOM that's inserted by another part of my jQuery code...it doesn't seem to be working.  Is that not something you can do?
[06:28:55] <arthurvr> you can do that normally. Please create a fiddle so we can take a look.
[06:28:59] <misutowolf> http://pastebin.com/8k9eQQUQ
[06:29:25] <misutowolf> I've got a pastebin, I can do a fiddle real quick though, I'm not used to messing with them, haha
[06:29:43] <bepolite> So which part of your code isn't working
[06:29:48] <bepolite> Whic select statement
[06:29:55] <arthurvr> yeah but keep in mind that the $.get is async
[06:30:02] <arthurvr> which is likely to be your problem.
[06:30:08] <arthurvr> otherwise, fiddle please.
[06:30:23] <misutowolf> Creating one, sec.
[06:30:24] <arthurvr> but yeah that will be the reason
[06:30:31] <arthurvr> you‚Äôll need a delegated event
[06:30:52] <arthurvr> since when you‚Äôre binding the handler the element does not exist yet (ajax requests are async)
[06:31:09] <arthurvr> anyways I‚Äôm off but that‚Äôs the problem lol
[06:31:27] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/L96cv4jy/
[06:31:50] <misutowolf> Ah, I see what you mean.
[06:31:55] <hissz00n> Yeah arthurvr is right
[06:32:03] * misutowolf reads about delegated events.
[06:32:19] <hissz00n> read up on async code and delegated events
[06:32:30] <hissz00n> or just create the elements before the request comes in
[06:33:08] <misutowolf> Ah, yeah.   Well, the creation of the elements is based on the data that comes in (number of elements being made).   It's for some homework for a class.
[06:33:14] <misutowolf> I think I can figure it out though, thanks a lot for the help.
[06:33:20] * misutowolf fiddles around with code.
[06:33:21] <misutowolf> jQuery is neat.
[06:33:40] <arthurvr> the problem is that the events get attached before the element exists
[06:33:49] <arthurvr> so delegated events will help
[06:33:53] <arthurvr> or just attach it in the callback
[06:33:53] <misutowolf> I understand.
[06:33:58] <arthurvr> k
[06:33:59] <misutowolf> *nod*
[06:34:14] <misutowolf> Ooh, I didn't think about using the callback for that.
[06:34:28] <arthurvr> if you have any more questions shoot lol
[06:34:32] <misutowolf> I haven't written async code in a while.  :P
[06:35:06] <arthurvr> misutowolf: I wouldn‚Äôt know anymore how sync feels
[06:35:14] <arthurvr> haha
[06:35:19] <misutowolf> haha
[06:38:23] <misutowolf> Oh shit, it works!
[06:38:28] * misutowolf dances
[06:38:31] <arthurvr> it does
[06:38:32] <bepolite> hahahah
[06:38:42] * arthurvr dances together with bepolite and misutowolf 
[06:38:48] <bepolite> At times I get scared when code works
[06:38:56] <misutowolf> I do believe that my professor will probably be impressed.  I think the other people in my JS class are all oost
[06:39:04] <bepolite> hahah
[06:39:04] <misutowolf> and are all just stealing code from places at this point and modifying it
[06:39:08] <misutowolf> lost*
[06:39:21] <misutowolf> I'm the only one who has any previous code experience at all, haha
[06:39:44] <misutowolf> In class when he gave this assignment, he told people to just try basic animations
[06:39:44] <arthurvr> misutowolf: can you send us the link to the code atm? We might be able to give some more hints lol
[06:39:50] <misutowolf> i was like "can I just do ajax instead'
[06:39:51] <arthurvr> misutowolf: haha
[06:39:52] <bepolite> LOL last year, a lecturer taught us javascript in 2 hours  and jquery the next 2 hours
[06:40:00] <misutowolf> 'animations are lame, ajax is amazing'
[06:40:09] <misutowolf> and people just looked at me like i was speaking russian
[06:40:14] <misutowolf> "wut."
[06:41:04] <robmal> Oh c'mon, check out http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js and tell me it's not amazing.
[06:41:15] <adv_> how can i watch if background-size has changed in an img ?
[06:42:06] <misutowolf> that is actually pretty cool
[06:42:06] <arthurvr> misutowolf: about your code, what‚Äôs the deal with ‚Äù$("#repos").html(‚Äù‚Äù);‚Äù?
[06:42:06] <bepolite> adv_: background-size as a css attribute?
[06:42:16] <adv_> no
[06:42:21] <adv_> err
[06:42:22] <adv_> yes
[06:42:30] <misutowolf> arthurvr: to wipe the container for results before i send something out
[06:42:36] <arthurvr> misutowolf: why don‚Äôt you just replace the html instead of clearing it out and then appending stuff again?
[06:42:42] <misutowolf> oh, i guess i could do that
[06:42:55] <arthurvr> saves you an operation and a repaint.
[06:42:58] <misutowolf> so my first thought was just "wipe the slate clean, then send a thing"
[06:43:21] <arthurvr> and it saves the user a flash of empty content
[06:43:41] <arthurvr> that was a good thought actually, just pointing out :)
[06:44:05] <arthurvr> misutowolf: also your prof isn‚Äôt going to like the missing semicolon on line 4.
[06:44:17] <bepolite> adv_: http://darcyclarke.me/dev/watch/
[06:44:30] <misutowolf> This is true.  :P
[06:44:50] <arthurvr> misutowolf: just pointing out some extra stuff :) sorry for being critical :)
[06:45:09] <misutowolf> Oh, that's fine.   I'd rather have mistakes and stuff pointed out to me than not.  It's the only way to learn.
[06:45:20] <arthurvr> sure. you‚Äôre welcome!
[06:45:25] <misutowolf> :D
[06:45:46] <arthurvr> another performance thing I had
[06:45:52] <misutowolf> Ugh, I'm nervous.  On an unrelated note to coding, I'm playing in my first big Magic (card game) tournament tomorrow morning.
[06:45:52] <arthurvr> but maybe you don‚Äôt want to go that deep?
[06:46:01] <sonotos> robmal: it's nice until you want to export it as pdf / document
[06:46:05] <arthurvr> misutowolf: success!
[06:46:57] <misutowolf> I had planned to go with friends to spectate, but when I told my local shop owner, he told me if I wore a shop t-shirt to represent the store, that I could borrow his competitive deck and play if I wanted
[06:47:08] <misutowolf> So I figured I'd give it a shot, haha.
[06:47:11] <adv_> bepolite: just tried that, doesn't work
[06:47:34] <misutowolf> So now I have a free t-shirt and my first tournament
[06:47:43] <arthurvr> misutowolf: have fun! :)
[06:49:08] <bepolite> well adv_ thats kinof old
[06:49:15] <bepolite>  I think https://github.com/RickStrahl/jquery-watch is more recent
[06:49:27] <misutowolf> Ugh, fuck Splinter Twin.  That deck is so annoying.
[06:50:41] <misutowolf> I will be back sometime later.   Thanks again, guys.  I appreciate the help for sure.
[06:51:26] <adv_> bepolite: i'll try thanks!
[06:52:12] <arthurvr> That last one seems like a really bad plugin. Wouldn‚Äôt use that but it‚Äôs your choice.
[06:52:27] <arthurvr> take a look at the source code, I mean.
[06:52:42] <arthurvr> https://remysharp.com/2010/06/03/signs-of-a-poorly-written-jquery-plugin
[06:53:21] <bepolite> adv_: I just tried the first one and It worked
[06:53:40] <arthurvr> adv_: if it didn‚Äôt work for you please post a fiddle or a jsbin
[06:53:47] <arthurvr> or did you do that already lol?
[06:54:56] <bepolite> quite simple. just 4 lines
[06:55:14] <arthurvr> robmal: that site you posted looks quite awesome
[06:55:38] <arthurvr> although they have some perf profiling to do lol
[06:55:42] <arthurvr> so janky
[07:00:16] <ello> Hello
[07:00:20] <ello> Question
[07:00:45] <adv_> arthurvr: why badly written?
[07:00:51] <ello> decx: arthurvr: is one of you around?
[07:00:58] <arthurvr> ello: I am here :)
[07:01:05] <arthurvr> adv_: that second plugin you mean?
[07:01:12] <adv_> yes
[07:01:49] <arthurvr> adv_: various things. Take a look at the source code: https://github.com/RickStrahl/jquery-watch/blob/master/src/scripts/jquery-watch.js
[07:01:56] <adv_> saw that
[07:02:00] <adv_> but i can't tell
[07:02:15] <arthurvr> adv_: line 60 for example. It overwrites native methods and could break other code that way.
[07:02:33] <arthurvr> just one example.
[07:02:36] <adv_> do you have an alternative to propose?
[07:02:40] <adv_> plugin
[07:02:45] <arthurvr> that first plugin lol
[07:03:06] <adv_> didn't work
[07:03:24] <arthurvr> it works (and is known therefor). If it didn‚Äôt work that‚Äôs a problem with your code lol
[07:03:38] <arthurvr> also things like https://github.com/RickStrahl/jquery-watch/blob/master/src/scripts/jquery-watch.js#L152
[07:04:07] <arthurvr> plus the author didn‚Äôt bother to use a decent code style or linter
[07:04:20] <arthurvr> all signs of a poorly written plugin.
[07:04:32] <ello> arthurvr: okay thank you.
[07:04:58] <ello> reading jQuery source code is advised to learn jQuery better isn't it?
[07:05:26] <arthurvr> it can be handy and is actually something I would advise every javascript developer but you shouldn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt learn jQuery that way lol
[07:06:03] <ello> arthurvr: Okay arthurvr I was just watching paul irishs screencasts that's why
[07:07:35] <adv_> bepolite: just tried and it errors
[07:07:45] <adv_> with < not expected or something
[07:07:57] <bepolite> let me create a fiddle
[07:08:03] <arthurvr> adv_: please post code, as said before.
[07:08:17] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions last paragraph.
[07:08:26] <arthurvr> we can‚Äôt help you without.
[07:08:42] <ello> arthurvr: I had a question about one rule can you help me?
[07:08:47] <arthurvr> I  can always take a look
[07:09:41] <ello> this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L252
[07:10:06] <ello> why does that passed code execute globally? It's all still in the scope of jQuery.globalEval isn't it?
[07:10:48] <arthurvr> ello: it creates a new <script> and adds the script you pass to it. That <script> gets added to the document and thus will get executed in the global scope.
[07:11:12] <ello> oh and what's with the last rule?
[07:11:25] <arthurvr> removes that <script> element from the DOM
[07:11:47] <ello> oh
[07:11:52] <ello> well thanks arthurvr and everybody else
[07:12:24] <ello> this is such an awesome channel
[07:12:30] <arthurvr> lol it is
[07:12:35] <ello> by
[07:12:36] <ello> e
[07:12:41] <arthurvr> b
[07:12:42] <arthurvr> ye
[07:15:51] <bepolite> kik
[07:19:04] <adv_> lmao
[07:19:41] <serge> Hey! I want to get involved in open source. Any suggestions anybody?
[07:19:57] <robmal> Buy me a beer.
[07:20:20] <serge> Who of you does open source frequently?
[07:20:25] <serge> robmal: lol
[07:20:38] <serge> robmal: if you buy me two
[07:21:08] <robmal> I'll give you all my sources for that one beer ;-)
[07:21:30] <arthurvr> serge: I am quite an open source addict. Any questions in specific?
[07:21:45] <serge> no just interested. where do you work on?
[07:22:33] <arthurvr> A whole bunch of stuff. I‚Äôm a team member at Html5 boilerplate, yeoman, jQuery and TodoMVC. But you should find the projects you‚Äôre interested in.
[07:22:37] <adv_> bepolite: https://github.com/jackmoore/wheelzoom/blob/2.0.0/jquery.wheelzoom.js
[07:22:42] <serge> okay thanks.
[07:22:44] <serge> arthurvr
[07:23:00] <adv_> does it work with this?
[07:23:00] <bepolite> adv_: http://jsbin.com/seyakisimu/1/
[07:24:30] <serge> arthurvr: any good first bug you can suggest me? hard to find something. Or anyone else?
[07:24:44] <bepolite> adv_: Does "what" work with weelzoom
[07:24:52] <arthurvr> yes but let‚Äôs move out of #jquery
[07:24:54] <adv_> bepolite: the css watch
[07:25:09] <bepolite> I don't know
[07:25:11] <bepolite> I havent' tried it
[07:25:23] <serge> sounds okay, see you. anyone else tips?
[07:25:53] <bepolite> serge: don't get fustrated if your pull request is not merged
[07:26:06] <bepolite> People think differently
[07:26:19] <serge> Okay. Thanks bepolite!
[07:26:54] <arthurvr> Try to find a project you‚Äôre passionated about. Don‚Äôt send PRs just to send PRs.
[07:27:06] <arthurvr> Also, don‚Äôt limit contributions to PRs. Try to talk to people.
[07:29:14] <bepolite> adv_: So you wanted to use the attribute change event to fire when an image is zoomed?
[07:29:22] <adv_> bepolite: exactly
[07:29:31] <bepolite> LOL
[07:29:33] <serge> still searching for a good first bug. bepolite you've got suggestions?
[07:29:40] <bepolite> serge: which project?
[07:29:56] <serge> something interesting front-end
[07:29:59] <bepolite> LOL
[07:30:04] <adv_> check lkml
[07:30:05] <bepolite> Read what arthurvr said
[07:30:29] <serge> alright
[07:31:01] <bepolite> serge: <arthurvr> Try to find a project youíre passionated about
[07:34:24] <serge> bepolite: can't one of you suggest something? I don't have any idea
[07:34:26] <bepolite> adv_:  I think this is what you need
[07:34:27] <bepolite> img.addEventListener('wheel', onwheel);
[07:34:27] <bepolite> 			img.addEventListener('mousedown', draggable);
[07:34:53] <serge> pasting code in the channel is against the rules if I may say that
[07:35:15] <arthurvr> pasting huge snippets is, these were 2 lines come on
[07:35:30] <bepolite> serge: have you built websites before?
[07:35:43] <serge> haha yes
[07:35:44] <bepolite> which tools did you use? bootstrap?
[07:35:49] <bepolite> jquery etc
[07:35:56] <serge> bootstrap jquery angular
[07:35:59] <adv_> bepolite: this is with the 1st plugin right? the old one
[07:36:16] <bepolite> That has nothign to do with the plugins I have you adv_
[07:36:41] <bepolite> Forget about those plugins. You dindn't come straight with your question earler
[07:36:45] <adv_> bepolite: but i want to check the background-size css property
[07:36:53] <adv_> i want to get its value
[07:36:59] <serge> bepolite: does that make sense? I know how to use many more tools
[07:37:37] <bepolite> serge: Is there any tools which you feel you can improve
[07:37:40] <bepolite> ?
[07:37:53] <arthurvr> All those tools are open source and have tons of open tickets
[07:38:01] <arthurvr> just pick one and try to dig in
[07:38:28] <bepolite> adv_: You're not still clear
[07:39:08] <serge> adv_: Please ask clear on-topic questions with a code example in a fiddle.
[07:39:19] <arthurvr> ^ I told that before isn‚Äôt it lol
[07:39:34] <bepolite> adv_: If you want a plugin that determines when the "background-size" property has changed, use http://jsbin.com/seyakisimu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:39:51] <bepolite> ^^ as an example
[07:40:24] <serge> bepolite: can I ask you a question? did you wrote that fiddle?
[07:40:45] <serge> is caching selectors not a best practice anymore?
[07:40:57] <arthurvr> it is but it‚Äôs a fiddle not real life code‚Ä¶
[07:41:03] <serge> ya but still
[07:42:01] <bepolite> I'm not sure I follow serge
[07:42:24] <serge> I was suggesting a performance improvement on your fiddle
[07:42:29] <serge> but arthurvr is right
[07:42:34] <serge> no big dealzz
[07:42:59] <bepolite> Ahh too many " $('#server-monitor')"??
[07:43:12] <serge> exactly.
[07:44:09] <serge> another question
[07:44:16] <serge> jQuery.cssNumber when is that ever useful
[07:45:31] <bepolite> serge: It's used by .css() to determine if it needs to add px to unitless values
[07:45:53] <adv_> bepolite: can't get it to work
[07:46:03] <adv_> i mean with wheelzoom integration
[07:46:18] <serge> adv_: do we have to say it again. Please include the code. We can't debug stuff this way.
[07:47:58] <adv_> div is [object NodeList]
[07:48:08] <bepolite> lol
[07:48:28] <arthurvr> we can‚Äôt know anything with that. Please include code. The problem is likely to be totally unrelated.
[07:53:45] <kokut> Hello, i need to get the height of the document or #main-wrapper but i'm getting different values even after issuing the command inside document.ready, is tehre anything else i can try?
[07:54:00] <kokut> im using (selector).outerHeight();
[07:54:31] * bepolite is away: I'm busy
[07:54:38] <arthurvr> kokut: could you fiddle something?
[07:55:34] <kokut> arthurvr: theres not much to fiddle man, my script works its just probably not the right way to do it in this scenario because a lot of stuff might be added after the document.ready is launched, thats why i need a different approach...
[07:56:01] <kokut> i'm getting completely different values, sometimes 700 sometimes 1800... etc
[07:56:18] <arthurvr> kokut: That‚Äôs why I asked to fiddle something. You might be totally doing it wrong lol. But it can be tricky to say the least.
[07:56:35] <kokut> arthurvr: i'm doing it right, its just not the right approach
[07:56:40] <kokut> for my scenario
[07:56:47] <kokut> thats why i'm asking for a different method
[07:59:36] <arthurvr> kokut: well the stuff that depends on the height just needs to run after your style/dom changes.
[08:05:50] <adv_> bepolite: figured it out. thanks. but how can i print the current background-size value?
[08:06:55] <arthurvr> `api css @ adv_
[08:06:55] <b-ot> adv_: .css(): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:09:07] <adv_> thanks
[08:10:40] <kokut> arthurvr: yea thats why i need to delay the calculation a lil bit
[08:11:12] <arthurvr> kokut: can you quickly explain what exactly is your use case?
[08:11:25] <arthurvr> mostly this kind of things sound like bad idea lol
[08:16:33] <fabiobik> what im doing wrong? $('input[name="login[username]:visible"').val();
[08:16:45] <fabiobik> i want to select by name and visibility
[08:17:47] <fabiobik> i found the problem
[08:17:55] <fabiobik> missing ] to close
[08:17:55] <fabiobik> $('input[name="login[username]"]:visible').val();
[08:18:31] <Hamzar> please i have this code works great with jquery , but when i try to use with jquery mobile it breaks as jquery mobile have a different page archecture : http://pastebin.com/ce0eJnT5
[08:19:26] <Hamzar> the code role is simple : it calss loadContent when the user scroll to bottom ..
[09:09:05] <Rushmead> Hello
[09:10:07] <Rushmead> I'm having an issue where on page load i use Ajax to load in some forms into a div, however my $("form").submit code doesnt work however if i manually put the code there it works fine
[09:10:11] <Rushmead> Anyone know the issue?
[09:44:30] <jop008> I have a slider select one of the options is selected when I disable the field the selected option is gone
[09:56:49] <bepolite> jop008: fiddle?
[09:57:19] <jop008> I changed it to this   $('#715_coverage_only_fire_aircraft').change(function () {
[09:57:20] <jop008>     $(this).val('1');
[09:57:21] <jop008>   })
[09:57:42] <jop008> but doubt if it is not changing because it changed endlessly
[10:04:28] <Rushmead>  I'm having an issue where on page load i use Ajax to load in some forms into a div, however my $("form").submit code doesnt work however if i manually put the code there it works fine
[10:04:54] <bepolite> jop008: but the code above says that the element should always have a value of '1'
[10:05:03] <bepolite> Isn't that what you want?
[10:06:36] <jop008> yes that's what I want but the code don't work
[10:06:53] <bepolite> jop008: then do a fiddle
[10:07:14] <bepolite> I'm not the problem is not with the piece of code you showeed
[10:07:25] <jop008> this is the html code <div class='ui-field-contain  hidden '><label for='715_coverage_only_fire_aircraft' >Brand vliegtuigschade standaard niet aanpasbaar:</label>
[10:07:25] <jop008>           <select name='715_coverage_only_fire_aircraft' id='715_coverage_only_fire_aircraft' data-role='slider'  data-mini='true'>
[10:07:26] <jop008>               <option  value='0'>nee</option><option  selected  value='1'>ja</option>
[10:07:27] <jop008>           </select></div>
[10:07:32] <bepolite> Fiddle
[10:07:52] <bepolite> jop008: do you know what a fiddle is
[10:07:52] <bepolite> ?
[10:07:57] <arthurvr> Please don‚Äôt paste chunks of code in the channel.
[10:07:58] <arthurvr> jsfiddle or jsbin please
[10:07:59] <arthurvr> ?paste @ jop008
[10:07:59] <b-ot> jop008: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:08:02] <jop008> and in js I have this $('#715_coverage_only_fire_aircraft').prop('disabled', true);
[10:08:09] <bepolite> lol
[10:08:23] <jop008> but selected is gone
[10:08:46] <arthurvr> First create a fiddle and then we can take a look :)
[10:13:06] <jop008> is there a fiddle with standard jquery mobile 1.4.5 some where which I can use?
[10:13:43] <arthurvr> jop008: there you go
[10:13:44] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/mutugeniwa/1/edit?html,output
[10:14:52] <jop008> new bin and then?
[10:15:14] <jop008> I was used to the old jsfiddle
[10:15:15] <arthurvr> the one I posted has jQuery mobile and jQuery in it. Just start with cloning that one.
[10:15:28] <arthurvr> file > clone
[10:15:51] <jop008> Now I try with only one option in the select then it can not be changed as well
[10:43:56] <vacho> how do i loop though all the form elements.. lets say my form is $('#filter-form'). ..how do I parse through each form field?
[10:45:15] <kokut> vacho could u explain a lil bit more what u wanna do
[10:45:40] <vacho> I want to push all my form input fields to a json object.. like this.. aoData.push( { "name": "_token", "value": $('#csrf-token').val() }
[10:45:49] <arthurvr> that‚Äôs not difficult
[10:45:54] <arthurvr> lemme fiddle something for you
[10:45:59] <arthurvr> give me 10 minutes
[10:46:01] <vacho> kokut: I am doing that for a specific field in my form..but I am sure there must be a way to prase through
[10:46:12] <kokut> vacho: yea i've done that many times
[10:46:16] <vacho> arthurvr: wow thanks man.. arthurvr note that I have some checkbox fields where the name is "group[]
[10:46:18] <kokut> its good when ur fields don't belong to a form
[10:46:46] <vacho> "group[]" .. there might be multiple "group" checkboxes selected..e.g. value=1 value=2 value=3 etc
[10:46:58] <DelphiWorld> yo all
[10:48:52] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/x0b5nhu4/ , i want to convert this to dynamic size , not the hardcoded 1140*400 (in the js )
[10:48:58] <adv_> any ideas?
[10:51:27] <DelphiWorld> is there a good way to display a splash screen?
[10:53:24] <Katronix> Hi all, can someone look at http://mjmagic.greensnakedesign.com/ and tell me what the spinning wheel is for? how do I get rid of it?
[10:54:41] <arthurvr> vacho: probably won‚Äôt get to it but you just need the following things
[10:54:53] <arthurvr> https://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[10:55:04] <arthurvr> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:55:17] <arthurvr> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[10:55:29] <arthurvr> vacho: sorry!
[10:55:39] <adv_> arthurvr: help?
[10:55:56] <arthurvr> adv_: what‚Äôs up?
[10:56:01] <adv_> ^
[10:56:03] <DelphiWorld> adv_: better to dont montion people:P
[10:57:00] <arthurvr> Yeah just pinging in random people to help you doesn‚Äôt make sense
[10:57:18] <DelphiWorld> lol
[10:58:59] <Katronix> Anyone know?
[10:59:11] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I'm having a problem
[10:59:22] <JosefDe> I'm doing this:     $('.uploadInfos').on('mouseover','.uploadButton', function(){
[10:59:38] <JosefDe> And inside that function I'M doing this:         $(this).parents('.uploadInfos').unbind();
[11:00:12] <JosefDe> The problem is, that the second code snippet disables the events for all elements inside ".uploadInfo".
[11:00:14] <JosefDe> How can I fix this?
[11:01:03] <bewilled> Hello guys, I am using jquery mobile and loading a navbar asynchrounsoly via ajax (the components gets to the page after the page has been loaded) So when the widget shows, only the raw html is shown. How do I make this widget appear as a jquery mobile component?
[11:01:29] <abijeet_> JosefDe, what version off jQuery are you using?
[11:01:35] <JosefDe> moment I'm looking
[11:01:42] <abijeet_> should try .off instead of .unbind
[11:01:56] <JosefDe> 1.10.2
[11:02:28] <JosefDe> off doesn't fix the problem
[11:02:39] <JosefDe> I replaced "unbind" with "off" but still the same issue
[11:06:00] <shoky_> JosefDe: .off('mouseover', '.uploadButton')    or use an event namespace
[11:06:49] <JosefDe> Your suggestion doesn't fix it. The strange thing is, that only if I click "uploadButton" only then mouseover for "info" works
[11:08:22] <n0rd> hello everybody
[11:08:55] <n0rd> The other day I met a javascript performance pro guy over here. Any idea who was that?
[11:10:15] <n0rd> arthurvr? are you around?
[11:10:25] <arthurvr> what‚Äôs up n0rd?
[11:10:34] <arthurvr> dunno but don‚Äôt consider me as a pro lol
[11:11:33] <n0rd> arthurvr: I have a snippet which seems to cause thousands of repaints? Any ideas? It's a simple loop and an if statement?
[11:11:53] <n0rd> http://pastebin.com/7mTFHN5F
[11:12:03] <arthurvr> Man that snippet is actually the worst. Let me explain you some things lol
[11:12:41] <arthurvr> first of all, and you might consider it as nitpicking but you should really cache selectors.
[11:12:52] <arthurvr> this selects the #table 600 times.
[11:13:03] <bewilled> How do you initialize widgets that get to the page after it has finished loading?
[11:13:21] <arthurvr> second thing, the :visible selector causes a repaint.
[11:13:28] <arthurvr> 300 times, actually.
[11:13:44] <n0rd> makes sense. is there more?
[11:13:48] <arthurvr> yes lol
[11:14:03] <arthurvr> you append to the table 300 times.
[11:14:27] <arthurvr> you might as well cache those strings into a string and only manipulate the DOM once.
[11:14:34] <arthurvr> Understood?
[11:14:51] <arthurvr> by the way is this a snippet literally from your code? what‚Äôs your use case?
[11:15:18] <n0rd> do you suggest I remove the :visible?
[11:15:27] <arthurvr> well where do you use it for?
[11:15:43] <n0rd> check if the element is actually there. Not to act on absent elements isn't it?
[11:15:57] <arthurvr> totally right +1! But you shouldn‚Äôt do that using :visible
[11:16:08] <arthurvr> you can just check if an element exists using the .length property
[11:16:17] <arthurvr> a jquery object is array-like
[11:16:25] <arthurvr> so you can check for the numeric length property.
[11:16:36] <n0rd> which is zero if that element doesn't exist?
[11:16:42] <arthurvr> right
[11:16:54] <n0rd> oh well I refactored my code a little thank you.
[11:17:20] <n0rd> you're my hero today arthurvr
[11:17:27] <arthurvr> you‚Äôre welcome!
[11:19:58] <n0rd> arthurvr: can you help me with something else?
[11:20:09] <arthurvr> I cannot, but the rest of the channel can :)
[11:20:28] <n0rd> okay then I come back later
[11:20:33] <arthurvr> no
[11:24:13] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I'm registering qtip-Event-Handler inside my own mouseover-event-handler. But somehow qtip is not reacting to mouseover then. How can I fix it?
[11:24:32] <arthurvr> JosefDe: You want to do a fiddle or a jsbin maybe?
[11:24:37] <JosefDe> sure
[11:24:48] <arthurvr> awesome. This way we can take a look :)
[11:28:04] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/bc80tkma/2/
[11:28:47] <arthurvr> qtip isn‚Äôt included in your fiddle?
[11:28:49] <JosefDe> oh wait qtip is missing as library
[11:28:54] <JosefDe> yeah. sorry, wait a second
[11:29:14] <arthurvr> No problem!
[11:29:32] <Hamza> guys anyone here have a good knowledge on jquery mobile?
[11:29:48] <arthurvr> Just ask. Please don‚Äôt look for topic experts.
[11:29:52] <arthurvr> ?ask @ Hamza
[11:29:53] <b-ot> Hamza: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:29:58] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/bc80tkma/3/
[11:30:12] <JosefDe> arthurvr: That should work
[11:30:21] <Hamza> arthurvr : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29579749/make-load-more-on-scroll-bottom-works-with-jquery-mobile/29580820#29580820
[11:30:44] <Uhkis> qtip is still not a function there
[11:30:54] <JosefDe> Uhkis: What do you mean?
[11:31:05] <arthurvr> look at the console.
[11:31:08] <Uhkis> JosefDe: js error in console
[11:31:10] <arthurvr> qtip isn‚Äôt defined
[11:31:21] <JosefDe> I don't get any error message
[11:31:50] <JosefDe> ah you're right
[11:31:53] <arthurvr> once you hover over it you‚Äôll get the error
[11:32:13] <Hamza> any help please guys?
[11:32:58] <Uhkis> anyways, doesn't qtip() just initialize qtip on the element? i think you should use trigger('qtips-event-here')
[11:33:49] <JosefDe> Uhkis: How should I change my code?
[11:34:09] <arthurvr> JosefDe: first make sure the library is defined.
[11:34:32] <Uhkis> from the docs: $('.selector').qtip('toggle', true); // Show  all tooltips belonging to the selected elements
[11:34:35] <JosefDe> It's defined in my local application, I don't know why jsfiddle doesn't accept the link "http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/qtip2/2.2.1/jquery.qtip.min.js"
[11:35:02] <albedoa> https://gist.github.com/albedoa/3adad60fcd5c5116b435 i have this $widget element that i want to remove on click, but also follow any links on the $widget if they are clicked. however, the element is removed before the link click can be triggered. how can i register the click?
[11:35:17] <arthurvr> because jsfiddle is loaded over https, JosefDe. The link you included uses http.
[11:35:18] <Uhkis> Blocked loading mixed active content "http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/qtip2/2.2.1/jquery.qtip.min.js"
[11:35:20] <arthurvr> browsers don‚Äôt like that
[11:35:26] <JosefDe> Wow!
[11:35:33] <JosefDe> Uhkis: Thanks. That worked!
[11:35:45] <JosefDe> Can you explain why I have to do this?
[11:36:03] <JosefDe> Why isn't doesn't qtip() initializing enough?
[11:36:48] <arthurvr> because they bind things to mouseenter as well and may want to show it before you init it.
[11:37:08] <arthurvr> as in the docs, init happens before the actual mouseenter
[11:37:25] <arthurvr> http://qtip1.com/demos/content/basic like there
[11:38:14] <arthurvr> preferably on document ready
[11:38:19] <arthurvr> JosefDe: ^
[11:38:32] <Hamza> guys any help please im tired fro this problem
[11:38:34] <Hamza> from
[11:39:13] <arthurvr> Hamza: if somebody has the time and wants to they‚Äôll take a look. Asking 3 times in 8 minutes doesn‚Äôt help.
[11:39:36] <Hamza> ok arthurvr
[11:39:42] <arthurvr> ;)
[11:40:42] <JosefDe> hmm..
[11:41:12] <arthurvr> JosefDe: you should init .qtip on doc ready and trigger it just on mouseenter
[11:41:29] <arthurvr> JosefDe: which the plugin just handles for you
[11:41:30] <JosefDe> I still don't get why
[11:41:44] <JosefDe> I don't get why I have to do manual triggering
[11:41:52] <arthurvr> you‚Äôre taking care of what the plugin should do for you.
[11:41:53] <JosefDe> I mean "toggle" stuff
[11:41:57] <arthurvr> I‚Äôll show you
[11:42:05] <JosefDe> Yeah. I don't get why init isn't enough
[11:43:45] <arthurvr> JosefDe: this for example: https://jsfiddle.net/bc80tkma/7/
[11:43:59] <arthurvr> works without the trigger because you call fn.qtip before the mouseenter happens
[11:44:07] <arthurvr> which is generally what you want
[11:44:11] <arthurvr> anyways I‚Äôm off guys. Byet
[11:44:15] <arthurvr> ~bye!
[11:44:32] <abijeet> JosefDe, can you please post a jsfiddle or something?
[11:44:37] <abijeet> unless its solved..
[11:44:47] <arthurvr> abijeet: it is lol
[11:44:56] <vacho> arthurvr: back! :) did u get something up?
[11:45:13] <abijeet> arthurvr, what was the issue if I may ask..
[11:46:01] <arthurvr> vacho: read up on the stuff I posted. don‚Äôt really have the time but posted some links which may help ;)
[11:46:20] <arthurvr> abijeet: ask JosefDe :)
[11:46:23] <vacho> arthurvr: oh ok.. i actually been trying for a day now..with no luck..I might just find another way
[11:46:47] <JosefDe> ok..
[11:46:55] <JosefDe> thanks
[11:47:01] <JosefDe> bye verybody
[11:47:07] <arthurvr> vacho: should be as easy as a loop using .each(), pushing to array, json.stringify.
[11:47:11] <abijeet> or not :)
[11:47:24] <abijeet> no problem, good he got it sorted..
[11:47:43] <vacho> arthurvr: do you mind just giving me the code for the loop..?? I will figure out how to solve the multiple "group[]" thing..but just being able to parse through my form and append to that JSON
[11:47:45] <abijeet> vacho, can you repeat your query?
[11:48:09] <arthurvr> vacho: $(‚Äòform‚Äô).find(‚Äò:input‚Äô).each(function () {}) should work fine
[11:48:39] <arthurvr> inside of the function $(this) refers to the input/button/checkbox whatever
[11:48:42] <Hamza> arthurvr could you help with my question please?
[11:49:00] <vacho> abijeet: yes in a sec.
[11:49:00] <arthurvr> Hamza: As I said, please don‚Äôt repeat stuff and please don‚Äôt ask people in specific.
[11:49:33] <Hamza> i will not ask you an other time i will see semeone here who could help me ok thanks

[11:53:57] <cookiepus> Hello!
[11:53:59] <vOOdle> hello everybody
[11:54:14] <vOOdle> is this the right syntax for tween hooks? http://pastebin.com/vEJa5pgi
[11:54:29] <arthurvr> it totally is bro
[11:55:07] <vOOdle> thanks arthurvr any idea why it doesn't work for me?
[11:55:15] <arthurvr> what version of jQuery are you using?
[11:55:21] <vOOdle> 1.7 I think
[11:55:26] <arthurvr> well that‚Äôs kind of a problem
[11:55:34] <arthurvr> it‚Äôs 1.8+
[11:55:36] <vacho> abijeet: check this out... aoData.push( { "name": "group", "value": 5 } .. see that? that works fine... but my problem is follwing.. I have a class of checkboxes called class "group-filter-checkbox" where the "name=group[]" ... how do I append all checked group[] to my aoData JSON?
[11:56:06] <vOOdle> oh well I updated and it freakin' works !
[11:56:10] <vOOdle> awesome you rock arthurvr
[11:56:55] <cookiepus> I have probably a very n00b question, but that's what I sort of am. i am using Jquery easy UI, and trying to change my page to react.js... my widgets stop working when moved into react. what i THINK happens is... jquery UI basically rewrites the widgets, but when they are rendred by react, they are rendered somehow after jqueryUI tried to do that. Does this make ANY sense?
[11:57:31] <arthurvr> cookiepus: could you try to create a fiddle? Many people will be willing to help you
[11:57:51] <cookiepus> arthurvr, awesome idea.
[11:59:06] <vOOdle> in the jQuery.Tween constructor is unit some kind of specific unit or should it be my choice?
[11:59:22] <arthurvr> the thing is actually that it should be a unit you choose
[11:59:24] <arthurvr> like ‚Äòpx'
[11:59:33] <vOOdle> you rock twice as much arthurvr
[11:59:36] <vOOdle> thank you
[11:59:40] <vOOdle> this jquery thing is so amazing
[11:59:56] <arthurvr> you‚Äôre welcome
[12:00:38] <cookiepus> ok another dumb q arthurvr . jQuery Easy UI is not in the library dropdown on jsfiddle. i tried looking for one on a cdn, nope
[12:00:46] <cookiepus> am i missing how to do this
[12:02:06] <arthurvr> cookiepus: let me cdn something up for you lol
[12:02:22] <arthurvr> cookiepus: there you go
[12:02:23] <arthurvr> https://cdn.rawgit.com/ni-jmatthiesen/jQuery-EasyUI/master/jquery.easyui.min.js
[12:02:34] <cookiepus> arthurvr,  you are awesome
[12:02:37] <arthurvr> cdn of jQuery EasyUI 1.3.5
[12:02:45] <cookiepus> i also think jsfiddle actually has it i just didn't look for it the right way
[12:02:56] <arthurvr> I don‚Äôt think it has it.
[12:04:13] <arthurvr> I wouldn‚Äôt say jQuery easyUI is dead but it‚Äôs not the most alive piece of software lol
[12:04:37] <arthurvr> it has still open bugs from 2011 without any response
[12:04:38] <arthurvr> loll
[12:04:49] <Uhkis> what on earth is jquery easyui
[12:06:00] <vacho> abijeet: did you get a chance?
[12:06:49] <arthurvr> Uhkis: it was a little more popular 4 years ago lol
[12:06:58] <abijeet> I'm sorry I'm dc'ing out so much
[12:07:04] <abijeet> Just setting up my new system
[12:07:18] <abijeet> i think i didnt get what you said.
[12:07:25] <arthurvr> Uhkis: cookiepus: In general I‚Äôd suggest to avoid it. It‚Äôs a piece of dead software.
[12:07:41] <Uhkis> yeah it looked even more outdated than jquery ui ;)
[12:08:49] <abijeet> vacho, i'll come back in a while, sorry.
[12:09:47] <arthurvr> Uhkis: You saw the new theme and stuff?
[12:09:57] <arthurvr> of jQuery UI I mean
[12:10:06] <Uhkis> arthurvr: no, where is it
[12:10:20] <arthurvr> nowhere atm. Let me show you something really quick.
[12:10:38] <arthurvr> you might have seen it it‚Äôs not that new
[12:10:43] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/fuqasizude/1/edit?html,js,output is ‚Äòold‚Äô huh
[12:11:22] <arthurvr> and this would become the new default theme in the future http://jsbin.com/mozasuhigi/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:11:35] <arthurvr> not sexy but better
[12:11:54] <Uhkis> way better
[12:12:21] <vOOdle> arthurvr: the new 'base' theme is far from done isn't it?
[12:12:26] <arthurvr> yeah
[12:12:28] <arthurvr> gotta leave
[12:12:32] <arthurvr> meeting time for this guy
[12:12:42] <vOOdle> bye and thanks for the help arthurvr
[12:12:48] <vOOdle> and it's freaking better indeed
[12:14:02] <arthurvr> Uhkis: looks not bad huh
[12:14:17] <Uhkis> so much better
[12:14:50] <vOOdle> that++
[12:15:46] <cookiepus> arthurvr, I just made my first fiddle: ) http://jsfiddle.net/5v4m35yz/1/
[12:17:49] <arthurvr> give me half an hour cookiepus. Just calling in on a meeting
[12:18:03] <vOOdle> have fun arthurvr

[14:12:14] <Trudko> guys after clicking on some td element in tr I want to find out  order of the element(if it's first, second etc )
[14:17:30] <Trudko> nvm got it
[14:17:53] <albedoa> http://jsfiddle.net/9g92t7sk/ i wrote a question in this fiddle. can y'all have a look?
[14:26:54] <shoky_> albedoa: use .detach() instead of .remove() if you want to keep the removed element's event handlers
[14:28:11] <shoky_> albedoa: alternatively, use event delegation (see docs for .on)
[14:28:55] <albedoa> awesome thank you shoky_ !!
[15:39:09] <bewilled> Why when I set data-icon="heart" I get a plus sign instead in jqm?
[15:43:40] <cambazz2> hello, i have a <div id="main"> <div></div> .. <div class="a"></div> .. <div></div> </div> and I want to find the index of the div with class a
[16:10:16] <bepolite> cambazz2: there?
[16:13:10] <bepolite> $('.a').index()
[16:13:15] <bepolite> cambazz2: ^^
[16:28:29] <cambazz2> bepolite: thank you very much
[16:28:41] <bepolite> np
[16:32:21] <cambazz2> I am using this slimScroll plugin, and i want to make ajax calls when it hits top and botton, which i do, but like when i scroll to bottom, it will make 1 ajax call, load up new stuff but then to scroll one more you have to push the scroll a bit up and then down again, how can i avoid this behaivor
[16:47:09] <acidjazz> whats hte latest on comet vs websockets
[17:27:35] <user__> hi everyone
[17:27:49] <user__> how can i change input value dynamically and at the same time simulate onkeyup
[18:03:53] <Verdaniss> user__ have you tried .val() and .keyup()?
[18:06:51] <user__> Verdaniss, yep the keyup did the trick thanks :D
[18:36:51] <acidjazz> whats hte best webscoket jquery plugin
[18:36:54] <acidjazz> or should i even use one
[18:43:41] <tw2113> not sure websockets and jquery mix that well. I don't think websockets are all that DOM based
[19:05:00] <Verdaniss> acidjazz, you probably want a javascript websocket plugin, rather than a jquery one :P
[19:05:00] <Verdaniss> websockets on the JS side are relatively easy iirc
[19:12:04] <luaboy> is .getJSON standard function ?
[19:13:15] <acidjazz> Verdaniss: yea im noticing that
[19:13:22] <acidjazz> Verdaniss: tahnks yea just using it raw is working well nice
[19:23:17] <luaboy> how to execute javascript in a browser?
[19:24:02] <albedoa> luaboy which browser?
[19:24:56] <albedoa> in Chrome you can open the Developer Tools and go to the Console tab
[19:27:17] <luaboy> albedoa:ie
[19:27:26] <albedoa> luaboy no idea
[19:29:53] <albedoa> i have a container div with margin-top: 60 and a body with no margins. $('body').offset.top is returning a value of 60. is this correct?
[19:30:38] <luaboy> albedoa:how do I put js code into a html page to execute it ?
[19:31:36] <albedoa> luaboy you put it between a <script> tag
[19:32:00] <Verdaniss> it's probably a quirk of css margins albedoa
[19:32:16] <Verdaniss> try setting padding-top: 60px on body and no margin on container?
[19:32:51] <albedoa> Verdaniss i will try that thank you
[19:44:11] <luaboy> albedoa:$.getJSON('/boll/', function(bolldata) {} , how to do if I„ÄÄneed to query /boll/ at other ip ?
[19:47:56] <Verdaniss> $.getJSON('http://otherip/boll', function(bolldata) {});
[22:50:16] <Katronix> Hi all, is this a good channel to get help with jQuery UI in? or jQuery Mobile?
[22:54:22] <bepolite> yes Katronix
[22:55:01] <Katronix> bepolite: thank you.
[22:55:23] <bepolite> just ask
[22:58:44] <Katronix> Is there any documentation on how to move a Bootstrap script to jQuery Mobile?
[22:59:30] <bepolite> how to migrate from bootstrap to Jquery Mobile?
[23:00:47] <Katronix> bepolite: yes exactly
[23:00:55] <bepolite> I think they have different uses
[23:01:23] <bepolite> But I haven't found any documentation though
[23:08:55] <Rashu> Why is it that when I use the .map function + this.text() I get: TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'this.text()')
[23:12:25] <rcyr> this is a normal DOM node, you need to jQuery-ify it to access its .text() function
[23:12:33] <rcyr> $(this).text()
[23:16:12] <Rashu> rcyr oh got it. that makes sense. rcyr do you have any documentation that describes the difference between simply this vs $(this)?
[23:16:21] <Rashu> I don't think i really understand the difference
[23:17:05] <rcyr> "this" is a "normal, non-jquery" DOM node.
[23:17:38] <rcyr> What jQuery does is that is "wraps" DOM node to augment them with more functions
[23:18:24] <Rashu> i see
[23:18:42] <Rashu> and text() is a jquery function, so it needs the wrapper?
[23:18:46] <Rashu> wrapper being $( )
[23:19:16] <bepolite> yes Rashu
[23:19:24] <Rashu> :) thanks guys!
[23:41:44] <luaboy> what does the function submit() really do ? what url does it use ?
[23:42:51] <bepolite> luaboy:  it submits the a form to the URL gotten from the "action" attribute in the <form> tag
[23:42:54] <MeiR-> luaboy, it uses the url from "action" attribute from the selected form tag
[23:43:07] <bepolite> ?api submit @ luaboy
[23:43:07] <b-ot> luaboy: .submit(): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[23:44:47] <luaboy> what is the relation between ajax and jquery ?
[23:45:21] <bepolite> Jquery helps you make ajax calls easily
[23:45:34] <bepolite> luaboy: do you know what ajax is?
[23:46:20] <luaboy> bepolite:not really
[23:46:21] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I get the error "TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'this.timers.show')". Don't know why this problem occurs. Can anyone help me please?
[23:47:59] <MeiR-> JosefDe, seeing your code will help us to help you, but without that, I guess that "this.timers" is not refrreing to a valid object
[23:47:59] <bepolite> ?learn ajax
[23:48:10] <bepolite> luaboy: https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[23:48:16] <bepolite> You've got to do some reading
[23:48:34] <MeiR-> JosefDe, additionally, you probably meant .show() and not .show
[23:48:42] <luaboy> MeiR-:do I need to specify the host's ip in the action tag for url ?
[23:49:12] <JosefDe> No I don't mean show(). I copied the exact error message and pasted it in here
[23:49:14] <JosefDe> it says "show"
[23:49:20] <MeiR-> luaboy, if the page is under the same hosting, then no
[23:49:52] <MeiR-> JosefDe, so instead of making assumptions, please pastebin your code
[23:49:58] <JosefDe> ok
[23:52:27] <Celelibi> Oh, hi.
[23:52:49] <MeiR-> JosefDe, in developer tools, does the error mention a line number in your script?
[23:53:01] <JosefDe> No. It tells me a line in the qtip library
[23:53:17] <luaboy> MeiR-:what is the root path for this page ?
[23:54:18] <Celelibi> Is there a way to see what are the functions waiting for the document to be loaded before being executed? In addition, can I state that my function would be run last?
[23:55:37] <MeiR-> JosefDe, and you know what part of your own script causes it?
[23:57:24] <MeiR-> luaboy, you can use relative paths or absoulte paths. assuming i have a form in http://example.com/site/form_files/form.html , and i want the action to be http://example.com/action.php
[23:57:41] <MeiR-> so i can set the action attribute in 2 ways:
[23:57:57] <bepolite> Celelibi: dev tools?
[23:57:58] <MeiR-> <form action="../../action.php">
[23:58:06] <bepolite> how do you want to see the functions btw?
[23:58:09] <MeiR-> or: <form action="/action.php">
[23:59:49] <JosefDe> MeiR-: http://jsfiddle.net/josefde80/wvk3aohr/
[23:59:52] <Celelibi> bepolite: what do you mean?
