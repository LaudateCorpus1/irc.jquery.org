[00:04:10] <Yahav> how can i achive this?
[00:07:05] <shomon> hi, I'm trying to get a form element to appear, and another and another, until a total of 3 are there. I'm following this tutorial - but http://charlie.griefer.com/blog/2009/09/17/jquery-dynamically-adding-form-elements/ ... I already have other javascript on the page. How do I make this work alongside them?
[00:07:30] <shomon> do I just take out document.ready? at the beginning, and put the rest on it's own?
[00:13:24] <KOTRET> anyone can tell me where i need to write my code to disable / enable my submit-button using the form-validation-plugin?
[00:22:55] <foxkid> Hi there... I began studying (x)html, css and javascript and now I want to start my studies on with jQuery
[00:23:01] <foxkid> my question is:
[00:23:39] <foxkid> using only jQuery can I put away javascript in my pages?
[00:24:09] <foxkid> I meant begin to use only jQUERY. and more more javascript.
[00:25:39] <kollapse> Hi. I'm having a little problem with the scrollTo plugin. I have a page that contains a table with about 200 rows (tr), each one with its own ID. Using scrollTo to scroll to the first couple of rows works well but as I choose a bigger ID and a row that is further down on the page, scrollTo's scroll exhibits an ever-growing offset. For example scrolling to rows 1,2,3 will work well, but scrolling to rows 100,110 will not scroll them to the top of
[00:25:41] <kollapse> the page, but rather the middle.
[00:26:30] <KOTRET> foxkid: you can use jQuery for many things, but in some cases you have to write own js. its better to know sth about general JavaScript istead only understand the syntax of jQuery
[00:27:15] <foxkid> thank you KOTRET for the answer.
[00:30:23] <Lochlan> I'm traversing the DOM, right bow I have a rubbish string e.g. children().children() because it goes down two levels
[00:30:27] <Lochlan> i can do find() instead
[00:30:38] <Lochlan> anyone have any comments? which is better?
[00:38:24] <Sam-T> is there a getClass() method to get classes from a selected element?
[00:38:39] <aibo> hello, how can i get `money` value from this form using jquery? http://pastie.org/2384710
[00:38:43] <Superman_> how to validate the radio group.. If there is any selected or not and print message accordingly??
[00:47:16] <KOTRET> aibo: $('input[name="money"]').val() ?
[00:47:38] <bjhaid> anyway i can ensure a jquery-ui dialog takes complete control of the browser rather than a single page once it displays?
[00:48:13] <KOTRET> Superman_: see http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/milk/
[00:49:29] <KOTRET> bjhaid: of course not, that would be a nightmare
[00:50:21] <bjhaid> KOTRET: i am polling and when a message is received i want the user to know with a dialog pop-up, but if they are not on the page that wouldnt occur
[00:50:50] <KOTRET> you can try a real popup window
[00:51:20] <KOTRET> or an alert, this often focuses the browser and makes it blink in the taskbar
[00:51:47] <bjhaid> KOTRET: how do i handle that, ( i would have very limited control on styling an alert)
[00:53:13] <KOTRET> bjhaid: i know, alert is system-depeding styled ;D
[00:54:20] <KOTRET> Superman_: your fiddle works as expected, where is the problem?
[00:54:54] <Superman_> I just need to check if there is something selected and it should work on pressing a submit btn
[00:55:15] <Superman_> both tasks.. should work on submit btn
[00:55:54] <KOTRET> so? just add your code in the click-function of the button
[00:56:04] <Keichi> hello all
[00:58:21] <Keichi> May I ask anyone some help for a multiple instance of jquery plugin in one page ?
[00:58:33] <kollapse> Can the :eq() selector be used with multiple indexes? For example $("li:eq(1,2,10,12)") for selecting the first, second, tenth and twelth list entries ?
[00:59:13] <Keichi> here's the page : http://kamuistudio-devs.fr/hangar/temp.html  you should notice yourself what's the problem is :)
[01:03:18] <Superman_> ..
[01:04:15] <Superman_> ..
[01:05:00] <KOTRET> Keichi: in your case you need 4 instances of showroom, you only have one var showroom holding only one div
[01:07:48] <Keichi> KOTRET: you mean '4 instances inner my js file' ?
[01:08:20] <KOTRET> Keichi: watch your jsfile: its only one var
[01:08:49] <KOTRET> of course the value of the var's div is overwritten by the last showroom.init
[01:08:59] <KOTRET> you need 4 vars :)
[01:09:50] <KOTRET> that does not mean you make 4 vars in your jsfile but make it an object and call showroom1 = new showroom('mydiv...')
[01:11:59] <Keichi> alright, but how can I make it an object ?
[01:13:45] <jQuestion> hi ! I would like to know how to make the function "change()" on an input after doing a replaceWith on this input? In my case I replace an <input text> with a select and the change() event does not respond, any ideas?
[01:14:49] <Cork> jQuestion: you mean the old event handle doens't respond?
[01:15:46] <jQuestion> Cork: hi, I have a change event on id=#idTest which is an <input text> ; then I replaceWith #idTest such as <select id=idTest> and my change event does not work anymore
[01:16:26] <Cork> jQuestion: the events is bind on the dom element, if you replace them, the event is removed
[01:16:37] <Cork> you can use live if you want it to stick around
[01:16:42] <Cork> ?.live @ jQuestion
[01:16:43] <bot-t1> jQuestion, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:16:47] <KOTRET> Keichi: http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2008/09/javascript-classes-for-n00bs/
[01:17:19] <jQuestion> haa ok Cork ! I would have think that replaceWith changes the DOM !
[01:17:39] <Cork> jQuestion: you can't change the dom nodeType
[01:17:44] <Cork> it has to be replaced
[01:18:10] <jQuestion> Ok ! I'm gonna try live thx you !
[01:19:41] <KOTRET> jQuestion: you also can define the function for change in a var and call it manually in your select-change too.
[01:20:17] <jQuestion> KOTRET: but my new select does not appear in the DOM I think
[01:21:22] <Cork> jQuestion: everything visible on the page has to be in the dom
[01:22:38] <jac0bz1> Hi! i'm a bit confused here... http://pastebin.com/aeP7WezT .. Whenever i press the "uplevel". i get a blank return....
[01:24:28] <Cork> jac0bz1: what do you see in the net tab?
[01:24:38] <Cork> is the data sent from the server?
[01:24:50] <jac0bz1> yes
[01:25:20] <Cork> your sending json?
[01:25:22] <jac0bz1> but if i alert(st); i get undefined
[01:25:26] <jac0bz1> no
[01:25:34] <Cork> whats data.st then?
[01:26:03] <jac0bz1> data is not defined
[01:26:15] <jac0bz1> this is inside the click function for .uplevel
[01:27:05] <Cork> jac0bz1: ok, lets back up, have you verified what you get in callback(data.st);?
[01:27:35] <Cork> if you don't get the right thing there what happens in the click doesn't matter
[01:28:21] <jac0bz1> i'll be back later.. i have to think about what im doing wrong
[01:29:57] <jac0bz1> Cork; http://pastebin.com/mrjMZwvp
[01:30:14] <jac0bz1> When i press ".uplevel" it fires of the function "loadDir" twice
[01:30:22] <jac0bz1> first time with the right result
[01:30:30] <jac0bz1> the second time with undefined
[01:31:42] <jac0bz1> no wait.. the loadParent is running twice it seems
[01:32:12] <Cork> jac0bz1: sounds like you bind the event twice somewhere
[01:32:30] <jac0bz1> the code i pasted is all the code i got
[01:32:56] <Cork> well its only the js, so can't really tell anything from it
[01:33:06] <VeXii> just a f.y.i but youre url strings a missing quote chars ?
[01:33:24] <Cork> jac0bz1: you would have to build a working example or give a link to the page for me to be able to help you
[01:33:29] <jac0bz1> the php code just returns a: a sring b: html of files list
[01:33:30] <Cork> ?p @ jac0bz1
[01:33:30] <bot-t1> jac0bz1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:34:16] <Cork> VeXii: it doesn't its php in a js var
[01:34:44] <VeXii> yeah but the php quote's gets removed and you have a string whith out quotes
[01:35:07] <Cork> VeXii: thers quotes outside the php tags
[01:35:24] <Cork> jac0bz1: start by constructing a redused testcase with no php
[01:35:30] <Cork> static html and js
[01:36:28] <jac0bz1> will do
[01:36:54] <Cork> its actually quite likly that you will spott the cause when you do :)
[01:47:03] <oquidave_> hello guys, i have a table with each row assigned a div id, now i want to select content of a specific cell/column in a particular row using ...........var name = $("#tr_8 td:eq(1)").text(); but am failing...
[01:47:17] <oquidave_> i need some help, thanks
[01:47:55] <dr0id> .html() , also setup a testcase if possible
[01:48:04] <dr0id> and you you give ids to each tr ?
[01:48:07] <oquidave_> the row id is #tr_8 and contains a checkbox, name and phone column
[01:48:07] <dr0id> why you*
[01:48:22] <oquidave_> dr0id, yes
[01:48:31] <dr0id> no
[01:51:58] <oquidave_> my table souce code looks like this ...http://pastebin.com/EdYZJdVX
[01:52:21] <oquidave_> i want to extract the name of the the checked name
[01:52:27] <dr0id> Heh
[01:52:37] <dr0id> basically you have a table without <table></table> ?
[01:56:50] <oquidave_> dr0id, i do have those tags, that is just an extract part of the table
[01:57:03] <dr0id> you can't have table > div > tr , that's invalid html
[01:58:20] <oquidave_> dr0id, okay, so i just have to assign each tr with an id for indentifcation?
[01:59:03] <dr0id> if you want to, but you don't need to
[01:59:30] <dr0id> as you can do table tr:eq(X)
[02:00:32] <oquidave_> dr0id, thanks, where X is what since it's a large table
[02:00:46] <dr0id> a number - index
[02:00:51] <dr0id> ?tias
[02:00:51] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[02:01:56] <oquidave_> dr0id, how will i know that index since the table is generated dynamically from the server side?
[02:02:15] <dr0id> ok, why do you need to identify them uniquely ?
[02:03:19] <oquidave_> dr0id, each table row has a checkbox, so when a user checks a particular item on the row, their actions they perform to that item like delete, edit that particular item
[02:03:44] <oquidave_>  dr0id, you get?
[02:04:05] <dr0id> kinda, you could use $(this).closest('tr'); in the checkbox's click event
[02:04:37] <DarsVaeda> Hi, I open a dialog window and need js to work in this, but the js is loaded before the popup opens so it does not work, I could put the functions needed in dialog.ready() but that is kinda redundant - is there a way to "reload" the js I need so it works in the dialog too?
[02:04:55] <dr0id> ?live
[02:04:55] <bot-t1> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:04:55] <oquidave_>  dr0id, okay, let me try that ...thanks man
[02:05:09] <dr0id> ?delegate
[02:05:10] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:05:23] <dr0id> have a good day!
[02:07:42] <DarsVaeda> oh I think that was for me :) thanks
[02:12:47] <oquidave_> can i pass a variable value to jquery like   var div_id='#test';   $(div_id).text();
[02:13:03] <gnarf> oquidave_: of course
[02:13:41] <oquidave_> gnarf, okay thanks
[02:14:18] <DarsVaeda> hmm does not work :(
[02:14:38] <gnarf> ?newContent @DarsVaeda
[02:14:39] <bot-t1> DarsVaeda, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:18:14] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm getting a load of items via json
[02:18:20] <EdwardIII> i want to make a little ticker thing that fades between the items
[02:18:24] <oquidave_> gnarf, i've something like this....http://pastebin.com/5RXbHkqK
[02:18:32] <EdwardIII> what's the best approach here? create an iterator object and rebuild it periodically?
[02:18:40] <oquidave_> gnarf, but it's not extracting the right value
[02:25:11] <DarsVaeda> newContent does not work either, I think I'm doing something wrong...
[02:25:11] <DarsVaeda> basically I have this line "$('.element').cFunction({ foo: "bar" });", that is loaded in a js somewhere in the header, I need to place it in dialog.ready() to have it work in the dialog too
[02:26:09] <DarsVaeda> so with "newContent" I would do : "$('.element').newContent( function() { this.cFunction({ foo: "bar" }); )" right?
[02:27:50] <IAMJONNY> hi, i have a ui slider and when and it has a max of value of 100 and a minimum of 1, if i drag it to 50 i want the colour of the input (where the value goes) to change colour? does anyone know how i would do this? i tried using change() but it it only changes to the colour red when i modify manually by typing in a value over 50
[02:29:52] <oquidave_> gnarf, it's okay, just missed something, thanks
[02:33:07] <sandstrom> is it possible to upload files using ajax without base64 encoding the file and sending as a string?

[02:39:29] <feisar> hi, I would like to create a slideshow but for a few divs containing <p> tags, could someone give me a few pointers?
[02:45:57] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[02:45:58] <Oana-> Who want to talk with a beauty girl msg me
[02:46:04] <DarsVaeda> do sortables work on multi-level lists?
[02:46:06] <Double_Rainbow> i know there is document.load
[02:46:47] <Double_Rainbow> but is there something i can use, like i wait for a facebook like button to load completely before i actually do my css modifications on it?
[02:47:13] <Double_Rainbow> the facebook iframe element has a default width that is way too large
[02:47:26] <Double_Rainbow> i need to patch it after it loads
[02:48:56] <EdwardIII> hrm, confused
[02:49:09] <EdwardIII> i'm returning someArray[i], but it's coming out as [Object object]

[02:54:34] <formers> hi is there an alternative UI library that uses the Jquery core (not jquery ui) ?
[02:54:49] <sean`> jquery tools
[02:55:10] <sean`> best is jquery diy
[02:55:50] <StyXLT> morning, anyone who tried using jQuery autocomplete had an error: a.element.propAttr is not a function ?
[02:56:09] <formers> thanks sean, jquery diy ?
[02:56:29] <StyXLT> i've included core, widget and position files as it depends on it
[02:56:58] <sean`> formers, jquery do it yourself bro
[02:57:04] <formers> ahh right
[02:57:05] <sean`> grab a keyboard and start typing :p
[02:57:22] <formers> write less do more ?
[02:57:39] <sean`> write more  do more
[02:58:17] <sean`> formers, lotta times plugins just don't cut it, and the simplest solution is to just do it yourself (imo)
[02:58:33] <sean`> also, relialibity can be an issue
[02:58:44] <blackspotwiggins> word
[02:58:55] <blackspotwiggins> 90% of plugins are rather bad
[02:59:10] <sean`> but, that's why stuff like jquery ui comes in.. they try to cut it (and do a decent job) and keep it reliable
[03:00:25] <formers> yeah I'm current;y trying to assess what we should be doing 1) continue to use jquery and write our own plugins, 2) use the plugins, 3) try and use Dojo/Ext JS with jquery, 4) move away from jquery. Problem with jquery plugins is the ongoing support etc..
[03:01:02] <sean`> formers, the answer lies within
[03:01:17] <sean`> once you giive/gain more perspective on what you're trying to achieve, it'll be a lot more clear
[03:02:56] <formers> pretty much looking for a rich User interface library (different widgets etc - date picker, spinner, possibly edit in place, editor, tree view, tabs, buttons, stylised radio/select)
[03:03:49] <fbdevuser> jquery.tmpl how can I replace ${key} with values in? <div id="mydiv">hello ${username}</div> ?
[03:05:42] <seutje> OHAI sean` !
[03:06:16] <sean`> olas!
[03:07:14] <bjhaid> is window.open built into the standard jquery?
[03:07:14] <DarsVaeda> can a draggable be a droppable too?
[03:07:23] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, no
[03:07:26] <sean`> lol
[03:07:27] <blackspotwiggins> its the javascript addon
[03:07:49] <blackspotwiggins> also look for googleit plugin
[03:07:49] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: would it work with jquery?
[03:10:42] <ablomen> bjhaid, jquery _is_ javascript, all default javascript objects/functions (like window.open) work, no matter if you use jquery or not
[03:12:32] <bjhaid> ablomen: thanks, got it working need to read up its options
[03:13:25] <James-_> hello
[03:14:57] <James-_> i try this : i have js file name test , in this file i have var test=[{test1,test2test3}] ect    in my php i try to pu this alert(test);   but     firebug say test is not defined why ?
[03:17:55] <sean`> James-_, is this your real life code? or just sample code
[03:19:41] <PeeterWork> James-_: Perhaps you forgot to include the JS file?
[03:20:34] <James-_> no PeeterWork the js is include
[03:20:41] <James-_> so i don t understand
[03:21:06] <blackspotwiggins> James-_, that line is so full of syntax errors
[03:21:45] <James-_> hum ?
[03:22:01] <blackspotwiggins> which part did you not understand
[03:22:33] <James-_> why test is not defined
[03:23:11] <PeeterWork> If your JS file is loaded, you should get some JS errors beforehand in the console
[03:24:15] <coldhead> ?eval var test=[{test1,test2test3}]
[03:24:16] <bot-t1> coldhead: SyntaxError: invalid object initializer
[03:24:36] <coldhead> something like that?
[03:24:40] <James-_> hum maybe it s because js is load just before /body no ?
[03:25:10] <blackspotwiggins> James-_,maybe its because SYNTAX ERROR. can you read ???
[03:25:53] <PeeterWork> blackspotwiggins: He would get the syntax errors in console before the alert call...
[03:26:06] <coldhead> ?eval var test=[{test1: 'test2test3'}];
[03:26:07] <bot-t1> coldhead: undefined
[03:26:24] <coldhead> no YOU'RE undefined, bot-t1
[03:26:35] <blackspotwiggins> PeeterWork, yes
[03:26:37] <PeeterWork> If his console doesn't have the syntax errors, he doesnt include/load the external JS file
[03:26:38] <blackspotwiggins> if  he could read
[03:27:21] <coldhead> blackspotwigginsm PeeterWork: maybe it's because js is load before /body ??
[03:27:31] <coldhead> oops, comma fail
[03:27:58] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, well if in php you pu alert(test) it also not work?
[03:28:15] <PeeterWork> James-_: Could you replicate your problem on jsfiddle.net ?
[03:28:38] <coldhead> blackspotwiggins: this my php: <?php alert(test) how to fix?
[03:28:47] <coldhead> i am using jquery
[03:28:54] <coldhead> jquery.php
[03:28:56] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, first day?
[03:29:03] <hooloovoo> =D
[03:29:11] <PeeterWork> You guys are extremly funny, however it doesn't really help him.
[03:29:58] <coldhead> none so blind as those who won't see
[03:30:48] <hooloovoo> coldhead: Jquery is not php. You can't try to execute it as such.
[03:37:38] <DarsVaeda> I have a multi-level droppable list where I drag a draggable item onto and return the id of the element dropped
[03:37:59] <DarsVaeda> this works, BUT it does not work on nested list elements, as there the id of the parent is returned
[03:38:07] <DarsVaeda> how do I get the correct id there?
[03:38:15] <bjhaid> i have this line in my code: $("<div>").html(g).dialog({ });, I am trying to replace this with,             var go = $("<div>").html(g);
[03:38:15] <bjhaid>             window.open(go, "_media", 'width=500,height=500,titlebar=no,toolbar=no');   but this doesnt work, any reason why?
[03:39:11] <DarsVaeda> if jsfiddle would load I can provide code
[03:39:12] <SkipperMix> I am trying to make a validator that validates that one date input field (If filled out, its not required) is lower (Older) than another date input field, I am then using this validate method I wrote (which might be very wrong) http://pastebin.com/815z6res
[03:39:59] <SkipperMix> What is the things I called "DateIn:" mean? how do they refere to textfields in the form?

[03:43:16] <SkipperMix> DarsVaeda taht link dont work?
[03:43:24] <DarsVaeda> not?
[03:43:45] <DarsVaeda> jsfiddle is very slow for me at the moment :(
[03:43:45] <SkipperMix> or maybe my workplace just cant enter jsfiddle
[03:44:13] <johnline3> $({'.projects a:first-child','.testimonials a:first-child'}).css('margin-left','0');
[03:44:30] <johnline3> is this line correct for these multiple selectors?
[03:44:34] <seutje> bjhaid: first argument to window.open is a string, not a jquery collection
[03:44:44] <DarsVaeda> how was that function again to prevent subelements to be recognized as parent elements
[03:45:14] <seutje> children?
[03:45:23] <krogant> how can i test to see if a series of page loads (in iframes) have "timed out"? just a simple setTimeout for 35s or so?
[03:45:29] <NoReGreT> I have a select with several options, how can i trigger an event when an option is selected ?
[03:45:29] <bjhaid> seutje: i see all i need to do is name the div tag and parse it in
[03:45:31] <DarsVaeda> whatever you call them :)
[03:45:44] <seutje> DarsVaeda: I meant .children()
[03:45:55] <seutje> NoReGreT: change event on the select
[03:46:14] <NoReGreT> seutje: and where will be the value ?
[03:46:45] <seutje> on the select, or it's .children(':selected'), not sure
[03:49:11] <seutje> NoReGreT: http://jsbin.com/uquyad
[03:54:11] <xec> johnline3: maybe this is what you're after? $('.projects a:first-child, .testimonials a:first-child')
[03:55:07] <oDesk> hello all
[03:56:40] <oDesk> i want to block multiple clicks on an object which could cause multiple Ajax call at the same time for the same object
[03:57:30] <oDesk> the event for the object triggered by  .click(function(){});
[03:58:35] <SkipperMix> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7091670/how-do-validate-one-datetime-is-newer-than-another-datetime-clientside-and-post-w
[03:58:37] <xec> oDesk: i'm not sure if theres an 'official' or commonly accepted solution for that, but what i usually do is set a variable to check for at start of the ajax call, and set it back after its done
[03:59:27] <DarsVaeda> http://jsbin.com/adeciw -> if you drag "meeting notes" onto "Flash" it alerts "2" which is the id of "Components" but "flash" has id 3 which should be returned
[03:59:30] <DarsVaeda> how do i do that?
[04:00:57] <johnline3> thanks xec
[04:01:34] <xec> oDesk: alternative solution could be to disable the click event while the ajax request is being processed
[04:02:02] <oDesk> xec: i'll use the first suggestion
[04:03:39] <quang> anybody here ?
[04:03:47] <quang> i have some question
[04:03:56] <xec> nobody is here
[04:04:22] <quang> oh
[04:04:43] <quang> what is "you" :))
[04:04:55] <xec> it's an english word
[04:04:57] <xec> xD
[04:05:24] <xec> just go ahead and ask your question, no need to ask if you can ask, or if people are here
[04:05:38] <quang> i have some confuse about drop and drag
[04:05:52] <quang> where i can find document
[04:06:12] <opius> Hi, i found a script for a facebook-style chat, i was wondering if anyone can help me understand it.. It's says it's a widget plugin, and can be used with whatever communication protocol i want, but i don't understand how to implement it. (I'm a asp.net developer, the chatengine is almost complete using mysql)
[04:07:17] <quang> @opius: mabye shre your link
[04:08:32] <opius> http://www.cs.illinois.edu/homes/wenpu1/chatbox.html
[04:11:27] <ablomen> opius, it's only ui, you will need to create your own scripts to send, receive and save chat messages
[04:15:11] <opius> i'll probably figure it out, just wanted to get started understanding the ui :)
[04:15:35] <carbonhat> I have several text inputs in a form that are modified by a callback function from a file uploader gizmo (KCFinder) -- I can't figure out how to detect when the empty inputs are populated......change, keyup, onpaste, keypress...none of them work
[04:17:27] <carbonhat> i found a solution on stack overflow for monitoring the input with setInterval, but I have like 8 inputs and don't want to be monitoring all of them several times per second
[04:17:54] <coldhead> you can't detect changes made by JS
[04:18:04] <coldhead> as in there's no event triggered
[04:18:15] <coldhead> so that's why the setInterval solution
[04:18:40] <coldhead> otherwise you might like to check the docs on your gizmo to see if it fires an event you can listen for
[04:19:01] <coldhead> OR you can maybe give it a function to call when the uploads are done
[04:19:02] <seutje> ?g kcfinder
[04:19:04] <bot-t1> seutje, KCFinder web file manager Homepage - http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/
[04:19:36] <coldhead> and give it like function () { $(this).trigger('my_custom_upload'); }
[04:19:38] <andrun> will you help me convert this from Prototype to jQuery http://pastie.org/2385432
[04:19:40] <coldhead> and bind to that guy
[04:20:49] <carbonhat> coldhead - thanks for the info. I'll dig some more in the documentation for kcfinder to see what I can find.
[04:21:21] <carbonhat> I'm sure it all makes perfect sense to some, but I'm baffled by the fact that there's no event triggered when JS makes changes to the dom.
[04:21:23] <seutje> window.KCFinder.callBack() method for single file or window.KCFinder.callBackMultiple() for multiple files.
[04:21:41] <seutje> there is, in fancy smancy browsers
[04:22:19] <carbonhat> seutje - I saw those functions when I was reading through the code last night, but couldn't figure out how to bind to the window.KCFinder.callBack() in my form controller script?
[04:22:49] <carbonhat> my brain gets all melty when JS passes stuff from one popout window back to my form
[04:24:30] <seutje> there's an example in the docs...
[04:24:54] <seutje> window.KCFinder.callBack(function() { console.log('HOLLA!'); });
[04:25:14] <seutje> bah, who capitalizes the B in callback? :/
[04:26:19] <carbonhat> lol someOne is a litTle camelCase crAzy
[04:26:37] <opius> g bnu nyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin
[04:26:39] <seutje> INORITE
[04:26:53] <carbonhat> I just found the docs example -- thanks for pointing me in the right direction, seutje !
[04:27:05] <seutje> pretty weird from some1 who named their library SEVENTEENLETTERSINFULLCAPSwithsomemorechars
[04:27:29] <opius> sorry, my son climbed the table, and sat on the keyboard :P
[04:27:31] <seutje> and I can't stop reading it as KFC-inder
[04:27:37] <carbonhat> indeed. the gizmo is nifty, but i'm not fond of digging through their source code
[04:27:50] <carbonhat> mmm....KFC....chikkken....mmmm
[04:27:52] <seutje> ?g kfc finder
[04:27:53] <bot-t1> seutje, Store Locator - KFC.com - http://www.kfc.com/storelocator/
[04:27:58] <carbonhat> hahaah
[04:27:59] <seutje> :D
[04:28:09] <sean`> seutje, that kcfinder is koole
[04:28:32] <blup> lol
[04:29:25] <seutje> looks very similar to IMCE
[04:33:41] <DarsVaeda> http://jsbin.com/adeciw/edit#javascript,html,live -> how do I make the second level (drag something onto "Flash") return the correct id? it returns the parent id instead
[04:37:49] <DarsVaeda> may this be a bug?
[04:38:50] <carbonhat> okay, so I have my callBack function doing its thing -- except my openKCFinder function is outside my document ready function, but my callback is trying to fire a function that's defined inside my document ready function...
[04:39:11] <carbonhat> how do I fire a function defined inside document ready function from outside document ready function?
[04:39:50] <chjj> carbonhat: you dont
[04:40:01] <carbonhat> lol...oh.
[04:40:21] <chjj> define it outside the ready function, or eventually throw out a reference to it somehow
[04:40:25] <carbonhat> i'm trying to move my 'outside drf' function into my drf...we'll see if it works
[04:40:57] <rpcesar> ran into a weird bug with a really weird fix, maybe someone could explain this to me. I am working on an anchoring system and ran into this in a unit test. I have 2 divs with an id, both of these are given a height, width, and background color in CSS (no position). I am essentially trying to align the 2 (the specifics are much more complicated) basically aligning div#1's left to div#2's right.
[04:41:29] <rpcesar> i grab the position of div#2 using position() , as well as calculating the right with width, etc.
[04:41:34] <rpcesar> now heres the interesting bit
[04:42:25] <rpcesar> if I go div2.css({position:absolute, left:div2precalc, top:div2precalc}); i see #1 drop below #2 on the render
[04:42:45] <HardPhuck> i need an advice, i have a menu that slides down with the page
[04:42:50] <HardPhuck> http://css-tricks.com/examples/ScrollingSidebar/
[04:42:51] <HardPhuck> like this
[04:42:57] <rpcesar> HOWEVER, if I call div2.css({position:absolute}); followed by the left and top (regardless of whether i position it beforehand), it will perform as expected
[04:42:58] <andrun> will you help me convert this from Prototype to jQuery http://pastie.org/2385432
[04:43:20] <HardPhuck> but the problem is that sometimes the menu has a lot of elements, which sometimes exceed viewport size
[04:43:38] <HardPhuck> then the last ones are never seen, and though not clickable
[04:45:13] <rpcesar> I want to know why setting position and THEN setting the other properties gives me different behavior from setting them all together.
[04:46:51] <rpcesar> here is the relevent code. ignore the anchor and resolve, those resolve identically on both trials, you can replace that with a given width and height.
[04:46:52] <rpcesar> http://pastebin.com/jd46JrGX
[04:47:48] <rpcesar> i want to know why that commented out code would change the behavior
[04:47:58] <rpcesar> what am I not understanding.
[04:48:10] <rambo3> debugging ?
[04:48:30] <rpcesar> lol
[04:49:12] <rpcesar> not sure how you debug something like this, im wondering how this behavior is defined, whether I am looking at a browser bug (chrome btw), or what exactly this issue is
[04:49:34] <rambo3> I just connected to this chanel dude
[04:49:57] <rpcesar> here is the relevent code. ignore the anchor and resolve, those resolve identically on both trials, you can replace that with a given width and height. [07:45] <rpcesar> http://pastebin.com/jd46JrGX
[04:50:12] <rpcesar> I want to know why setting position and THEN setting the other properties gives me different behavior from setting them all together.
[04:50:18] <rpcesar> i want to know why that commented out code would change the behavior
[04:50:33] <rambo3> How do i pass element in jquery . <img onclick="remove(this)" /> <script> remove(el){  $(el).parent().remove($(el)) ;} </script>  doesnt work
[04:50:56] <anli_> Can't I use element.is('[disabled]') to see if an element is disabled?
[04:51:34] <anli_> oh, .is(':disabled')
[04:52:16] <rpcesar> ... nevermind then. rambo, you cannot use "this" within an onclick. heck, you should be avoiding onclick. give the image an id. attach to its click handler with jquery
[04:53:45] <rpcesar> and yes anli_, .is(':disabled') would work, however selectors like that can be slower, it may be better to simply test for the attribute without a selector. ie myelement.attr("disabled");
[04:54:13] <rpcesar> that should return either true or "disabled" (I forget which, I think the behavior changed at some point)
[04:54:22] <anli_> I dont care a lot about faster or slower :)
[04:54:28] <anli_> "more beautiful" is the real value
[04:54:44] <w5> rpcesar: why is ':disabled' slower?
[04:54:51] <anli_> However, seems that .is(':disabled') does not work very well, will always return true
[04:55:06] <rpcesar> its using a selector vs checking an attribute directly
[04:55:22] <rpcesar> for a single element case, its useless bloat
[04:55:24] <Andy-> hey guys if I've written a basic scoller using .hide('slide'....); and I leave it open on a tab which isn't active and then go back to it it completely spacks out
[04:55:26] <sean`> seutje, yeah, but imce isn't that super IMO
[04:55:31] <Andy-> any ideas?
[04:56:21] <rpcesar> andy: what is a scoller, and why are you building it with .hide()
[04:56:26] <anli_> If you do something to improve performance, and nobody would notice the increased performance, then you have done a useless task :)
[04:56:33] <Andy-> it's a list of links
[04:56:38] <Andy-> 1 hides next 1 appears
[04:56:58] <rpcesar> im guessing your accidently getting an element mixed up and hiding the whole thing
[04:57:05] <rpcesar> perhaps something is attached to a resize event
[04:57:07] <Andy-> if the tab is left active
[04:57:12] <Andy-> and I leave it
[04:57:14] <Andy-> it never breaks
[04:57:24] <rpcesar> switching out can cause a resize.
[04:57:26] <Andy-> it's only if I goto a different tab, leave it and come back
[04:57:29] <rpcesar> do you have any weird resize code?
[04:57:35] <Andy-> nope nothing
[04:57:41] <rpcesar> can you post a link?
[04:57:49] <Andy-> I'll get a pastebin
[04:57:55] <rpcesar> link to a page please
[04:58:05] <Andy-> not feasible unfortunately
[04:58:07] <Andy-> all local dev
[04:58:11] <rpcesar> i shouldent even be helping people right now, i certainly don't have time to test like that.
[04:58:39] <Andy-> that's fine I'll just see if someone else is around which does :)
[04:58:44] <rpcesar> np
[04:58:56] <Andy-> It's a very random bug and tbh isn't a massive issue
[04:59:08] <Andy-> you literlly have to swap tabs, leave it for a while then go back to said tab
[04:59:15] <Andy-> anything else won't replicate it
[04:59:40] <rpcesar> unfortunately i couldent tell you much without running it
[05:01:05] <Andy-> rpcesar, s'cool
[05:03:51] <birdpoop> Hi , i retrieve a li element with ajax and after i loop through my document performing a function on these li's but it does not work, it does work on li's that were already present
[05:04:15] <seutje> so awesome to get design guidelines that have like "16.55pt" in it
[05:05:44] <miss_spelling> anyone have experience of firing 3rd party adverts after onload using jquery?  I've created a script but I can't execute the code that the advertisers use, it's based on <script> tags in page and I have no idea how to execute those, I wanted to try and do friendly iframes but unfortunately these external scripts generate the iframe... any suggestions welcome
[05:05:54] <seutje> lemme just font-size: 22.06666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666667px real quick
[05:06:39] <rpcesar> birdpoop: how did you write your selector?
[05:07:05] <w5> birdpoop: the li elements you retrieve with ajax, do you insert them somewhere?
[05:07:10] <DarsVaeda> is any jqueryUI dev on here or where would i find them?
[05:07:19] <seutje> miss_spelling: I've come to the conclusion that advert scripts are designed to break when they're implemented in a non-dirty way
[05:07:28] <seutje> advert need that doc.write, yo!
[05:07:32] <w5> DarsVaeda: there is #jqueryui-dev for that
[05:07:37] <DarsVaeda> ahh thx
[05:07:57] <miss_spelling> seutje: I hear you my friend, stillw ant to try and get round it!
[05:07:58] <birdpoop> 1: i use append on an ul to add the li 2: i use the classname of a span within the li to call it like so: $('.classname')
[05:08:04] <seutje> ?gl
[05:08:04] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[05:08:16] <miss_spelling> lulz
[05:08:20] <seutje> well that doesn't exist anymore :/
[05:08:47] <w5> birdpoop: are you sure that your append work?
[05:08:54] <seutje> miss_spelling: I wish you much strength and perseverance
[05:09:06] <rpcesar> ive done it.
[05:09:10] <birdpoop> definetly i can see all the pictures and other things that are in it
[05:09:15] <rpcesar> its possible. its tricky, but definately possible
[05:09:25] <miss_spelling> seutje: been reading this http://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/iframe-loading-techniques-performance looks promising
[05:10:03] <w5> birdpoop: you have something like: <ul><li class="classname"></li>...<li class="classname"></li></ul> ?
[05:10:20] <miss_spelling> I would be fine if it weren't for the fact the external scripts create their own iframes
[05:10:32] <rpcesar> ill give you a hint
[05:10:45] <rpcesar> the trick involves overloading document.write
[05:11:49] <birdpoop> about that except the element im calling is within the li <ul><li></li>...<li // the appended one><span class="ClassImTryingToCall"></span></li></ul>
[05:12:51] <rpcesar> miss_spelling: there is always a solution if you are willing to look outside the box. odds are noone around here will be able to help you though
[05:13:03] <rpcesar> or some of us need bribed.
[05:14:26] <w5> birdpoop: can you show us some of your js code
[05:14:32] <birdpoop> sec
[05:14:42] <w5> birdpoop: use pastebin please
[05:16:16] <eml> Is there a way through jquery that I can do something like: var name='somename'; {name: 'somevalue'} and name in the object would be replaced by somename? I suppose serializing is the correct word
[05:17:10] <miss_spelling> rpcesar: can you suggest a box to break out of?
[05:17:30] <miss_spelling> sorry just read up
[05:17:48] <birdpoop> w5: http://pastie.org/2385625 , the each finds all elemennts with the given class except for the new one
[05:19:39] <miss_spelling> rpcesar: thanks for the hint...  I believe http://wd.iworld.com/forum/showthread.php?t=195112 is along the right track
[05:20:26] <birdpoop> i know the loops a bit double but that was just to find the bug
[05:20:52] <w5> birdpoop: .timeCountdown is the class in the span?
[05:21:15] <birdpoop> the span has that class yes
[05:21:37] <w5> birdpoop: I think I understand the problem
[05:22:29] <w5> birdpoop: you should put $('.timeCountdown').each(function() {}); inside the callback of $.get('/first_ending/', ..)
[05:22:59] <SPYGAME> how can i send a POST request to a script back to my server ?
[05:23:07] <w5> birdpoop: you are treating an asynchronous call as something synchronous
[05:24:15] <w5> birdpoop: I think it does not work because jquery tries to execute something on .timeCountdown but these elements do not exist yet
[05:24:31] <birdpoop> yes that was it indeed, tyvm
[05:24:39] <w5> birdpoop: :)
[05:24:46] <w5> birdpoop: anytime
[05:24:49] <birdpoop> i get it a bit now
[05:25:10] <birdpoop> it probably executes the .get after all the other code?
[05:25:12] <catcatcat> does anyone know how can i select all labels for inputs?
[05:25:44] <w5> birdpoop: I don't understand your question

[06:05:34] <EdwardIII> catcatcat: i'm a noob, so i doubt i'll be able to help, but pastebinning your code is probably a good idea
[06:05:49] <duellsy> anybody successfully got phpunit working?
[06:06:13] <w5> EdwardIII: +1
[06:06:20] <duellsy> sorry, wrong room
[06:07:30] <catcatcat> ok this is my code: http://pastebin.com/WuYjCbCH and i am using this plugin http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator and trying to add method to it is instructed here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod
[06:09:00] <w5> EdwardIII: what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:09:35] <EdwardIII> w5: i want to fade-in a paragraph of text, fade it out, then fade in another, different paragraph of text
[06:09:40] <EdwardIII> w5: cycling through the 'items'
[06:13:29] <w5> EdwardIII: 'items' is an object?
[06:15:22] <EdwardIII> w5: it's a function with a closure... but 'items' works OK
[06:15:28] <EdwardIII> it's just the jquery stuff i'm not so sure on :)
[06:15:44] <EdwardIII> i think the problem lies around #28
[06:17:44] <PeeterWork> Anyone got any info on if using a ContextMenu is a good idea?
[06:21:21] <Bubbi> Hi Guys, I was wondering if any of you have any good solutions to using animate() with transparent PNG images in IE6,IE7 and IE8? I have tried a few solutions that are not working great for me.. http://www.dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_belatedPNG/  and http://www.viget.com/inspire/jquery-ie-png-24-ie-black-background-issue-solved/
[06:22:42] <w5> EdwardIII: how to load content in the div?
[06:23:33] <w5> EdwardIII: how do you load content in the div?
[06:23:41] <Bubbi> The problem with the different solutions I have tried, is that the png image is a background on an element, that is animated and it doesn't work with those two solutions as far as I have tried
[06:24:31] <EdwardIII> w5: with append. if i comment out 2 of those lines: https://gist.github.com/1151521 # i get hello world followed by goodbye world, ad infinitum
[06:24:48] <EdwardIII> but i want it to fade out the existing p, then replace it with the new one
[06:25:20] <w5> EdwardIII: well find the existing p in the div first using an appropriate selector
[06:25:40] <w5> Bubbi: have you tried http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/ ?
[06:26:47] <hiryu_> hello
[06:27:53] <Bubbi> w5: Nope, and right now i'm trying to load the website.. I think that the google code website went down in the same second as you wrote..
[06:28:33] <Bubbi> their frontpage is up, but i can't get further and their searchfunction on the page is not responding either (just keeps connecting)
[06:28:48] <w5> Bubbi: same for me
[06:28:55] <w5> hiryu_: hi
[06:31:11] <Bubbi> w5: hah, finally it sent me this page: "502. That’s an error" ...  "Please try again in 30 seconds. That’s all we know."
[06:31:42] <Guest42576> Hello all, does any one know how to mid for loop cause the screen to update?
[06:32:17] <Guest42576> ex i have an array of items but im calling $(mySel).text(status); in the middle of it after each call
[06:32:47] <Guest42576> However, the screen wont update until the loop it complete.
[06:34:35] <catcatcat> hey everyone i am trying to add a function after validation like this:   $("#contact-form").validate({}, function(){bla bla}); but does not work any ideas?
[06:36:30] <Bubbi> w5: Now google code is up and running again. I haven't tried it as I mentioned, so I am just about to try it out
[06:36:31] <Sean-Der> What is the best to tell if a certain div is empty? .length appears to find the amount of elements? I am looking for a text counter really to find if a div is empty or not?
[06:37:19] <w5> Bubbi: good.
[06:37:20] <rambo3> Sean-Der: just a guess .html() ==""
[06:38:07] <ajpiano> $("elem").is(":empty")
[06:38:39] <Sean-Der> ajpiano: That just returns a T/F I can use an IF statement?
[06:38:39] <w5> ajpiano: +1
[06:38:49] <ajpiano> ?tias
[06:38:49] <w5> Sean-Der: yes
[06:38:49] <bot-t> Try It And See
[06:40:16] <w5> EdwardIII: I almost have a solution, wait for it...
[06:43:55] <Sean-Der> Hmmm... :empty works great is there an opposite? :full?
[06:44:41] <ajpiano> !$("elem").is(":empty")
[06:45:38] <gf3> custom selectors FTL
[06:46:12] <e-anima> is there some kind of selector wildcard?
[06:46:28] <e-anima>  $('#edit-notify-type', context).hide();   i want to select everythind that is #edit-notify-type*
[06:46:35] <moglino> hi ya. what mouse do you recommend for working long hours?
[06:47:20] <xec> e-anima: [id^=edit-notify-type]
[06:47:20] <hariom> How to get scrollbar into a fixed hight div ? I have a div that dynamically gets data. How to get scrollbar if there is more data that can fit in div ?
[06:47:46] <e-anima> $('[id^=edit-notify-type]', context).hide();
[06:47:49] <e-anima> like this?
[06:47:50] <Brodingo> overflow: scroll
[06:47:52] <xec> right
[06:47:52] <hariom> This div is actually a sliding window
[06:47:59] <e-anima> ok i will try that
[06:48:20] <xec> ^= means starts with
[06:49:29] <dytrivedi> hi moglino
[06:50:13] <moglino> hi
[06:50:13] <bot-t> (1 min 4 secs ago) <dytrivedi> tell moglino no mouse. just use your mind to control the cursor.
[06:50:38] <hariom> Brodingo: Thanks that has worked. How to get rid of horizontal scroll bar?
[06:50:53] <Brodingo> maybe overflow-x: hidden
[06:55:11] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/N8YDGKpP
[06:55:22] <hariom> Brodingo: it works. Thanks
[06:55:34] <Sean-Der> Does anyone have any idea why if the alert in there the hide works? But if I comment out nothing happens?
[06:56:38] <xec> Sean-Der: sense. you make none
[06:57:38] <Sean-Der> xec: Hahh none sense I make young skywalker
[06:57:55] <Bubbi> w5: Now I've tried the IE7 javascript (IE9.js from the library) and it doesn't fix the problem. It only makes sure that IE 5.5 - 6.0 shows png images correctly when png's are used normally. Not while the animate() or any other jQuery opacity effect is used on the image.
[06:58:00] <xec> "why if the alert in there" ?
[06:58:04] <Sean-Der> In the function I posted in pastebin for some reason the button hide ONLY works if I have the alert before it
[06:58:15] <Kronuz> hey there!
[06:58:23] <Sean-Der> But if I comment out the alert all the sudden it doesn't work!
[06:58:50] <Kronuz> I have this problem about jQuery UI (using selectable and draggable): http://jsfiddle.net/P2keM/1/
[06:58:54] <xec> ok now i understand what you mean
[06:59:06] <xec> but it still doesnt make much sense :D
[06:59:18] <Sean-Der> xec: Me or why it doesn't work hah?
[06:59:32] <Kronuz> how can I make the selectable items selectable by click? …why doesn't it work the way I have it?
[06:59:48] <xec> commenting out an alert (assuming youre doing it right) shouldnt affect anything but the alert
[07:00:01] <Sean-Der> Just doing a //
[07:00:12] <w5> Bubbi: have you tried this http://jc-designs.net/blog/2010/07/ie-png-problem-when-used-with-jquery-animate/ ?
[07:00:17] <Sean-Der> For some reason the lack of an alert kills the function
[07:00:36] <xec> yeah, that doesnt make any sense :)
[07:01:10] <Bubbi> w5: coincidentally I've just found that page myself :-) I'll just take a read and hopefully i will return with a positive answer
[07:01:16] <xec> you didn't put \\ by mistake or something?
[07:01:51] <w5> Bubbi: good luck
[07:01:55] <Sean-Der> xec: Even if I remove it completely it kills it!
[07:02:05] <Sean-Der> xec: Could I cheat the system and do some silent alert?
[07:02:18] <Brodingo> Sean-Der is it in a doc ready funciton
[07:02:30] <Bubbi> w5: Thanks :-) Hope it works.. i've spent 3-4 hours already, just researching for a solution..
[07:02:38] <xec> Brodingo is onto something
[07:02:45] <xec> the alert makes your script wait
[07:02:55] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[07:02:58] <Sean-Der> Could I do a wait for .001 sec?
[07:03:03] <w5> Brodingo: np
[07:03:04] <xec> hehe
[07:03:04] <Sean-Der> I don't know how though :/
[07:03:08] <w5> Bubbi: np
[07:03:10] <Brodingo> no, you could put it in a doc ready function
[07:03:34] <Sean-Der> Its nested inside a big doc ready though?
[07:03:59] <xec> and the button is not created by the script?
[07:04:35] <Brodingo> also, all this while loops business is kinda ugly you should do an .each()
[07:04:40] <xec> im just thinking out loud, that last thing doesnt make sense
[07:04:42] <Sean-Der> Can you show me an example of what you are saying? Could it have something with it being called in with an Ajax function?
[07:05:07] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: Can you should me what you mean by doc ready? I have something else in mind
[07:05:14] <xec> do you have an url to your entire code?
[07:05:18] <Brodingo> ^
[07:05:35] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/Tc1NL7yx
[07:05:45] <Sean-Der> Its a work in progress so its alot of spaghetti code
[07:06:21] <xec> looks like only your .get is inside the document ready?
[07:06:31] <xec> or wait
[07:06:32] <Brodingo> should put that stuff in the success callback of the load method
[07:06:50] <Sean-Der> No everything else works correctly I think its ok?
[07:08:32] <xec> youre right, just lacking indentation
[07:09:04] <Sean-Der> xec: Sorry, bad coding practices I am learning as I go
[07:09:58] <Brodingo> Sean-Der here: $("#" + product + prodloop).load("productgets.php?dropdown=" + droploop, function(){ // while loop stuff here });
[07:11:55] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: I am confused what are you asking/telling?
[07:12:33] <Brodingo> youre using a load function, and the while loops to hide things is executing before the stuff is loaded
[07:12:44] <Brodingo> put that functionality in the callback of the load function
[07:12:46] <Brodingo> for great justice
[07:12:47] <xec> line 27
[07:13:07] <Brodingo> knowing how ajax works gets you all the girls
[07:13:23] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: Ahhh! Thank you thats where I messed up. Ok I will adjust
[07:14:57] <w5> EdwardIII: are you here?!
[07:15:52] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: http://pastebin.com/rHbCssxb I get what you are saying but isn't the load done when the loop starts?
[07:16:07] <supsup> odd is firefox 6 triggering true for ie6? in jQuery?
[07:16:31] <Brodingo> Sean-Der thats not how ajax works
[07:16:36] <Brodingo> and thats why you dont get the girls
[07:16:44] <rbanffy> Hi folks. What is the standard practice when jQuery breaks on a specific TV-embedded browser? Can we fix it and submit a patch? Should we submit a patch to the jQuery Mobile folks?
[07:16:50] <Brodingo> ?ajax101
[07:16:51] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[07:17:16] <supsup> nevermind
[07:17:31] <xec> Sean-Der: the load will not stop the script and wait for result and then do the loop
[07:18:25] <xec> Sean-Der: so the solution is to do the loop after the load is done, and you can do that by supplying it as a callback - if i understand correctly
[07:18:30] <xec> i'm new at this too xD
[07:19:00] <uchuff> answered my own damn question while typing it out
[07:19:02] <Sean-Der> Ok makes sense just never manipulated my .load with callback so struggling at first!@
[07:19:03] <uchuff> like a boss
[07:19:23] <uchuff> first time i've used .live(), pretty handy
[07:19:30] <EdwardIII> w5: sorry got caught up in something else!
[07:19:37] <EdwardIII> w5: https://gist.github.com/1151521
[07:19:59] <EdwardIII> w5: seems to work OK using the method in that post!
[07:20:07] <w5> EdwardIII: I have something working
[07:20:19] <w5> EdwardIII: which post?
[07:21:11] <m4xx> I'm trying to make my tab navigation auto scroll. I've got it mostly working but it's slightly off, it always partially hides the last element. Anyone care to help me out? http://jsfiddle.net/64Z5E/11/
[07:22:13] <Brodingo> wow this is annoying
[07:22:27] <m4xx> talking to me Brodingo?
[07:22:43] <BillCriswell> I think it could be a pretty cool effect
[07:23:12] <Brodingo> maybe
[07:24:19] <w5> EdwardIII: here my working version: https://gist.github.com/1151612
[07:24:22] <shomon> I'm trying to show a form element if it's filled in. But I do  if ($('#formelement').val()!='')... and it never seems to match that
[07:24:32] <shomon> what would it be equal to if it was never set?
[07:24:50] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: Thanks for the help I got it working!
[07:24:53] <shomon> if I do an alert for the .val() of the element, it doesn't print anything...
[07:24:59] <Brodingo> cheers
[07:26:04] <shomon> can I just do if($('#formelement').val) {do stuff} ??
[07:26:35] <w5> shomon: on which element is #formelement applied to?
[07:26:42] <shomon> an input element
[07:27:09] <shomon> just a regular input box, although it has a jquery datepicker attached
[07:27:24] <Brodingo> dont forget the parens, val is a method
[07:27:34] <shomon> aah okay, will try that
[07:27:35] <w5> shomon: then do $().attr('value')
[07:27:51] <w5> shomon: then do $(#element).attr('value')
[07:28:00] <Brodingo> wat
[07:28:03] <Brodingo> no
[07:28:15] <shomon> aah okay. I think it's the last one w5 said.
[07:28:29] <w5> and I forgot the quotes of course!
[07:28:40] <w5> EdwardIII: what do you think?
[07:29:49] <shomon> that worked fine - it was the brackets, thanks very much!
[07:30:39] <m4xx> it seems that it's off by about 5 pixels per tab
[07:31:21] <m4xx> if i were to add 60 to the value of scroll_area it seems to work
[07:31:54] <w5> m4xx: why not add a padding right to the ul?

[07:38:04] <Brammm> Hi guys. I'm encountering a really weird IE8 behavior: I have multiple select fields, that have a class "blargh". I have a $('.blargh').change(function() {}); that gets called perfectly in Chrome, FF, IE9
[07:38:09] <Brammm> but you guessed it, not in IE8
[07:38:09] <anli_> The "getting help on irc" link that w5 invoked seems to be the best written one I have seen
[07:38:26] <Brammm> Anyone got a clue what might be causing this?
[07:39:11] <w5> anli_: +1
[07:40:39] <w5> Brammm: http://stackoverflow.com/q/208471 might help
[07:41:30] <Brammm> w5 thanks. I've just noticed though it's probably a bug somewhere else in my code. If I comment everything except the change event, it does work :p
[07:41:45] <w5> Brammm: cool
[07:41:51] <Brammm> w5: not really :p
[07:42:05] <w5> Brammm: I mean 'cool it's not jquery' :p
[07:42:07] <Brammm> There are  700 lines of javascript, this is gonna take a while :p
[07:42:08] <Sonderblade> if i click on a <tr> element with the class "header", how can i set display: none on all <tr>'s below that <tr> until the next <tr> with class "header"?
[07:43:05] <w5> Sonderblade: use next() and test for the presence of the class
[07:43:41] <Sonderblade> w5: ?
[07:44:34] <m4xx> xec, mind if i pm?
[07:44:54] <xec> i'm off in a minute, i'm afraid
[07:46:06] <w5> Sonderblade: you have a table like this one: <table><tr class="header"></tr>  <tr></tr>  <tr></tr> <tr></tr>  <tr></tr>  <tr class="header"></tr></table> ?
[07:46:34] <Sonderblade> w5: yes
[07:47:00] <nail_> there is .nextUntil()
[07:47:15] <nail_> ?nextUntil @ Sonderblade
[07:47:15] <bot-t> Sonderblade, .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[07:48:28] <w5> nail: I did not know this one
[07:48:45] <w5> I think this what he needs
[07:50:56] <EdwardIII> yeaaah boy, i'm the king of functional programming now
[07:51:17] <w5> EdwardIII: you solved your problem?
[07:51:44] <m4xx> xec, i fixed the problem you encountered but my original problem still remains, still cant get the last tab to completely show:  http://jsfiddle.net/64Z5E/15/
[07:51:48] <EdwardIII> w5: i did ^
[07:51:55] <EdwardIII> w5: https://gist.github.com/1151521
[07:52:08] <EdwardIII> w5: thanks for your tips
[07:52:14] <m4xx> oops http://jsfiddle.net/64Z5E/16/
[07:53:05] <w5> EdwardIII: here is my version: https://gist.github.com/1151612
[07:53:39] <w5> EdwardIII: max and increment() are not really necessary
[07:54:46] <EdwardIII> w5: that is nicer
[07:55:16] <w5> EdwardIII: what is nicer?
[07:55:23] <EdwardIII> w5: your code
[07:55:46] <w5> EdwardIII: thanks
[07:56:15] <EdwardIII> although i need to keep the max (items could get pretty big) - your way is more elegant
[07:56:22] <EdwardIII> you elegant swine
[07:57:11] <w5> EdwardIII: I mean max is not necessary because it's the same as array.length
[07:58:09] <EdwardIII> w5: but array.length could get into the hundres and i only want it to display the first 5 elements
[07:58:20] <EdwardIII> but it's cool! i see what you mean
[07:58:32] <w5> EdwardIII: I understand
[08:00:04] <w5> EdwardIII: I was glad to help, I will leave now.
[08:00:31] <EdwardIII> although there is something kinda weird, i'm seeing "jj" in the chrome console
[08:02:20] <w5> EdwardIII: jj?
[08:04:06] <kapowaz> is there a jQuery method to determine what the index value of an element is within its parent container? e.g. n for an unordered list?
[08:04:48] <danheberden> kapowaz .index(), but prevAll().length is pretty handy
[08:04:55] <EdwardIII> w5: yep, 'jj'
[08:05:58] <danheberden> kapowaz if you're looking to loop through all the li's to get all the index values, better start higher up: get .children(), iterate through that set and keep an index
[08:06:09] <danheberden> so you aren't querying the dom every <li>
[08:06:44] <interopcop> how do you iterate over all children?  is there a children().each?
[08:08:11] <danheberden> interopcop there is .children(), and there is .each()
[08:08:12] <nullwire> can anyone tell me how to alert('something') on the change event for this? http://premiumsoftware.net/cleditor/docs/GettingStarted.html#cleditorMethod
[08:08:15] <danheberden> ?children @ interopcop
[08:08:16] <bot-t> interopcop, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[08:08:18] <danheberden> ?each @ interopcop
[08:08:18] <bot-t> interopcop, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:09:29] <danheberden> nullwire since they don't fire events you have to pass a functoin into it
[08:09:40] <danheberden> .chance( function() { alert( 'somthing' ); } );
[08:09:43] <danheberden> *change
[08:10:22] <danheberden> looks like it does fire an event, it's just not clear if they namespace it
[08:10:41] <Sonderblade> nail_: i tried that but it doesnt work.. i think
[08:10:41] <danheberden> so $( yourElement ).bind( 'change', function() { alert('something'); });
[08:10:52] <nullwire> danheberden, ah thank you
[08:12:09] <m4xx> when using overflow:hidden. is it possible to get the total width that the hidden content is?
[08:12:43] <sinneD> hey ajpiano, are you there?
[08:12:55] <ajpiano> kinda
[08:13:06] <nail_> Sonderblade: http://jsfiddle.net/KgvDR/ click on '2'
[08:13:14] <kapowaz> danheberden: I should have thought to try .index(), cheers
[08:13:19] <sinneD> sup man, you remember you helped me with some code yesterday?
[08:13:29] <ajpiano> sinneD: i know :)
[08:13:30] <sinneD> ajpiano: this code: http://jsfiddle.net/7qhVb/3/
[08:13:30] <kapowaz> it's less for iteration and more for determining if I'm looking at a specific index element
[08:14:01] <ajpiano> yep
[08:14:08] <w5> nail_: nice
[08:14:46] <sinneD> I've been messing with it, and I noticed that when I use it in the form of $.tasks({'action':'getlists'}) it picks up the passed option
[08:15:01] <ajpiano> sinneD: oh whoops
[08:15:07] <ajpiano> i forgot to pass the options along in the $.fn.tasks
[08:15:08] <sinneD> but when using $("#taskList").tasks({'action':'getlists'}) it doesn't pick up
[08:15:13] <sinneD> only the defaults
[08:15:23] <ajpiano> just make it so it's $.when( $.tasks(options) ).then....
[08:15:28] <iEatChildren> im not really sure where to ask this...maybe someone can point me in the right direction. Basically im want to have videos on my mobile website open using the default video player on the device. for example f you go to http://m.wimp.com/bikeskills/ on an android phone it will open up fullscreen instead of playing on the web page itself...how do i do this? just link to the video file directly?
[08:16:11] <sinneD> ajpiano: do you mean I should put my options in fn.tasks as well?
[08:16:33] <ajpiano> sinneD: they're already defined as an argument, i just forgot to pass it along into the actual $.tasks function
[08:16:48] <sinneD> ajpiano: how would I do that?
[08:16:51] <ajpiano> just make it so it's $.when( $.tasks(options) ).then....
[08:17:01] <ajpiano> sinneD: how long have you been programmin the javascripts :)
[08:17:34] <sinneD> ajpiano: since a month, I've been coming from python and erlang
[08:17:38] <sinneD> it's much different :)
[08:17:44] <Sonderblade> nail_: thanks now it works
[08:18:10] <ajpiano> well i'm sure in both python and erlang they have the concept of passing something from one function to another function to another function :)
[08:18:23] <sinneD> that's what I mean, don't we already pass it with: $.fn.tasks = function( options ) {
[08:18:36] <ajpiano> sinneD: no
[08:18:43] <ajpiano> well, yes
[08:18:50] <ajpiano> it is getting passed into the jquery plugin function
[08:18:54] <ajpiano> but then a couple lines later
[08:19:00] <ajpiano> i actually call "$.tasks"
[08:19:05] <ajpiano> but i wasn't passing the options argument to *that*
[08:19:36] <sinneD> I see
[08:19:49] <sinneD> in that case I changed it to $.tasks(options)
[08:19:52] <sinneD> now it works :)
[08:20:17] <sinneD> I don't think you need any if logic for it
[08:20:32] <ajpiano> that's all you had to do
[08:20:38] <sinneD> great
[08:20:47] <sinneD> thanks again man, I appreciate it :)
[08:21:11] <sinneD> I know about parsing, I wasn't realizing we're basically calling the same function, but in a different way :)
[08:24:40] <Sonderblade> when you use .toggle() to toggle visibility on a selection, is there a good way to check if the toggling showed or hide the selected items?
[08:26:00] <zulax> would this not work? $('#album-art > img').attr('src','ok');
[08:26:27] <jproffer> not sure about the selector
[08:26:28] <m4xx> try prop instead of attr
[08:26:59] <jproffer> his attr syntax is right
[08:27:03] <m4xx> or is prop for bool
[08:27:42] <Marcus11> when entering a value in my autocompelte field i see this in firebug: d.element.propAttr is not a function
[08:27:42] <jproffer> prop is for dom
[08:28:08] <Marcus11> code looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZfAqA/
[08:28:44] <zulax> ok
[08:32:33] <johnline3> hey guys
[08:32:35] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/btkYT/1/
[08:32:46] <johnline3> i need some help with tabs and multiple gallerias
[08:33:28] <johnline3> i cant work out the best way to trigger the correct slideshow when the corresponding tab link is clicked
[08:34:05] <jeffsmykil> Im getting an uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #    from this: http://pastie.org/private/rbpnelh9puyi498ssg9vra
[08:34:22] <bezidejni> hi guys
[08:34:26] <bezidejni> i have a quick question
[08:34:29] <bezidejni> http://jsfiddle.net/SKVAS/
[08:34:55] <bezidejni> when i check a checkbox, another field on the form should become disabled
[08:35:04] <bezidejni> and it works alright
[08:35:52] <bezidejni> but when i submit the form and it reshows with errors and my data, the checkbox is checked but the field isn't disabled
[08:36:30] <bezidejni> is there any way other than to manually check if the checkbox is checked and disable the field
[08:36:44] <bezidejni> because i feel that leads to duplicate code which i'd like to avoid
[08:36:48] <m4xx> $('.checkbox_class').prop('checked');
[08:36:56] <e-anima> is there a way to trigger a fucntion on load? i did like $('input[id^=edit-notify]', context).trigger('change');
[08:37:10] <e-anima> but thats only @change of the checkbox if i click it
[08:38:31] <bezidejni> that would trigger the event, right?
[08:38:49] <bezidejni> but won't change the checkbox checked status?
[08:41:25] <terminal_case> I have a question regarding the hide function in jquery, for anyone that cares to answer.
[08:42:45] <NL_Ed> Can someone look at my script and tell me why the form isnt submitted after pressing .noSubmit http://pastebin.com/S8PS3GHY
[08:45:50] <timing> terminal_case: I was searching for your question, but couldn't find it, did you hide() it?
[08:46:23] <timing> NL_Ed: the submit() in .noSubmit call's your own submit();
[08:46:28] <timing> which returns false
[08:46:43] <terminal_case> @timing, lol, my bad, I was merely announcing that I had one. I was just now pasting my code into jsfiddle and about to provide a link
[08:48:51] <NL_Ed> timing: What do you mean?
[08:49:38] <NL_Ed> timing: Ah right I get you, so what would be the work around
[08:50:14] <timing> NL_Ed: I think by not adding a submit button, but a normal button
[08:50:28] <timing> NL_Ed: then the normal button calls submit() if it's okay
[08:51:04] <timing> NL_Ed: but maybe you can detect in the submit() if it was called by you or by the form itself
[08:51:30] <terminal_case> it's rather long, and the html is incomplete because I only pasted the relevant bits, but the code is here:
[08:51:30] <terminal_case> http://jsfiddle.net/gsurr326/AT3Te/2/
[08:51:31] <NL_Ed> how about
[08:51:35] <muzone> Hey! Why is it a big no-no to put JavaScripts in the head?
[08:51:37] <terminal_case> eh, sorry
[08:51:39] <terminal_case> I'll wait
[08:52:00] <NL_Ed> timing: How about, instead of form.subit(function() have #id").click
[08:52:06] <NL_Ed> timing: That would work wouldnt it?
[08:52:43] <jita> I have an image and i want to add 2 classes to it, one is javascript and other is css style like <img src="javascript css_style" but whenever i do that, javascript does not work, if i apply it as id then it works perfectly, any ideas?
[08:52:45] <timing> NL_Ed: yeah I think so!
[08:52:57] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[08:53:08] <terminal_case> Note: for some reason, the code works fine in jsfiddle, but not in firefox. I'm getting the error, "c.replace is not a function"
[08:53:09] <timing> NL_Ed: I have to go, but I think you got it :-)
[08:53:36] <terminal_case> @Jita, what exactly do you mean?
[08:53:52] <terminal_case> you're not applying any classes in that example
[08:54:26] <muzone> Hey! Why is it a big no-no to put JavaScripts in the head?
[08:54:33] <muzone> There was a URL you guys used to share
[08:54:33] <RealSolid> is there a nice way to overlay some text over a div
[08:54:54] <Brodingo> probably
[08:55:05] <RealSolid> say i have a <div class='blah'></div><div>Text I want over blah</div>
[08:55:20] <NL_Ed> Thanks timing
[08:56:14] <Brodingo> RealSolid well you could put the text in the div, you could use position:relative or absolute, negative margins, a lot of things that dont require jquery
[08:56:22] <muzone> Anybody know of a decent article why JavaScripts should be loaded in the footer and not the header?
[08:56:35] <Brodingo> so it doesnt block
[08:56:38] <jita> terminal_case: i have an image, and i use jquery script to create rollover effect to that image, now i apply that script using <img class="script">
[08:56:42] <Brodingo> </article>
[08:56:43] <RealSolid> negative margins dont work because i dont know the height
[08:56:46] <interopcop> danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/97stU/1/ doesn't work.  I don't know why.  an you steer me in the right direction?
[08:56:58] <jita> terminal_case: and also there is a style sheet defined for the positioning of that image, and i want to apply that too
[08:57:11] <RealSolid> i just want something to be able to "Fill" the div area
[08:57:46] <Brodingo> sounds like you should put it in the div and z-index it above the other elements
[08:57:50] <terminal_case> muzone, here's a link to one that mentions the problem briefly: http://michaux.ca/articles/the-window-onload-problem-still
[08:58:13] <jita> terminal_case: sorry what i meant was <img class="jquery css_style">
[08:58:38] <terminal_case> alright. so, you have those styles defined in the stylesheet, yes?
[08:58:50] <jita> terminal_case: yes
[08:58:58] <Brodingo> those are some good class names
[08:59:06] <terminal_case> jita: and by rollover effect, you mean it will show/hide on rollover? or change?
[08:59:25] <jita> terminal_case: it will switch between 2 images, for mouse rollover
[08:59:57] <RealSolid> Brodingo: except the div inside wont take up the full height will it?
[09:00:38] <Brodingo> position: absolute; top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0
[09:01:12] <terminal_case> jita: okay. do you want animation or anything? because I'm thinking you could just hide/show the elements in question; as in, hide the first, show the second.
[09:02:14] <muzone> much obliged terminal_case :-))
[09:02:26] <terminal_case> muzone: you're welcome :)
[09:02:33] <jita> terminal_case: something like this http://www.elated.com/articles/css-rollover-buttons/
[09:02:56] <terminal_case> oh oh oh
[09:03:23] <terminal_case> I get it. you want to define in your stylesheet one class that's css_style and one that's css_style:hover
[09:03:56] <jita> terminal_case: its not hover, its separate script to do that task, to create hover effect
[09:04:28] <guy> how do I iterate through an object?
[09:04:37] <terminal_case> jita: So you have your own hover effect you want to apply?
[09:04:41] <guy> say I have an object {foo: 'bar'}
[09:04:42] <jita> like <img class="css_style script_to_execute_roll_over_effect">
[09:04:42] <tbranyen> ?each @ guy
[09:04:43] <bot-t> guy, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:04:47] <jita> terminal_case: yes
[09:04:59] <tbranyen> guy: $.each(obj, function( key, val ) { });
[09:05:22] <Thomas`-> hey all. is there anyway to get the current GET parameters as a string in format attr1=val1&attr2=val2 etc?
[09:06:02] <GoodAD> niko is a hacker who take ircop power for make pedophilia with innocent people, police make your job, stop niko now!
[09:06:05] <guy> I get data.each is not a function
[09:06:13] <sahilsk> hello guys.  Novice, here. This plugin is working fine in Firefox,chrome but working partially in IE8. Any help would be great. http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/ksjJX/
[09:06:37] <jita> terminal_case: it works fine if i alter script to use 'id' rather than class like <img id="script" class="style">
[09:07:12] <terminal_case> Hmm.. I gotta be honest, I may not be the best one to answer this question. I'm a bit new to jquery myself.
[09:07:49] <terminal_case> I actually came here to ask a question but ended up trying to help lol.
[09:08:03] <jita> lol
[09:08:07] <jita> no probs
[09:11:44] <gemclip> can someone tell me why this selects the checkbox in IE but no other browser? http://jsfiddle.net/d8Sds/ and what change should I make to select it in all browsers?
[09:12:16] <gemclip> specificly this line: $("form :checkbox:checked").css("border", "3px solid red");
[09:14:22] <formers> jita: If you want to do rollover, then the article that you showed is the best way to do it
[09:16:38] <strawberrybunny> I've got a div that contains nothing and has a background-image set on it. I have tried to use jQuery.click() to set a window.open() call so that hypothetically, it'll open a link when I click the div. Unfortunately, the div shows the link mouse icon when I hover over it, but does absolutely nothing when clicked
[09:16:48] <strawberrybunny> http://dev.xgames.weyak.ae/
[09:17:00] <strawberrybunny> The backgrund image is supposed to be a link
[09:17:00] <jita> formers: have to use photoshop for that, and i am quite inexperienced at that :(
[09:18:21] <formers> or if you want to via jquery then do $("#myIdasSelector").hover(function(){$(this).removeClass("myOldClass").addClass("myNewClass");},function(){$(this).removeClass("myNewClass").addClass("myOldClass");}) and state your image url within the myOldClass css definition and myNewClass css definition;
[09:18:33] <tomkane> anyone: when I do an ajax POST, I'm getting back a response with the data in json format. but the response comes back as a download file. the only difference between my response http headers and those of a properly working POST response is the my response headers LACK a header named 'vary' with content value of 'Content-Type'. could that cause my browser to be looking for a downloaded file? :-S
[09:20:01] <formers> jita: you now only need to use photoshop if you want an image displayed. The arcticle that you showed uses one image, you can do it using two images if you want
[09:21:00] <formers> Alternatively, don't use an image at all... if you're not experienced with CSS then you can create css outline using this site: http://www.cssbuttongenerator.com/
[09:22:22] <formers> you can also use Jquery using toggleClass() instead of removeClass().addClass()
[09:22:52] <gemclip> was I clear enough what I was looking for? if not please let me know
[09:23:55] <jita> ok thanks
[09:24:03] <e-anima> i am trying to check an input that lies in a div that has an id that contains ... if ($('div[id^=edit-notify-type] input', context).attr('checked') ) {
[09:24:14] <e-anima> that is not working, any tips?
[09:27:04] <formers> e-anima: can you try $("div#edit-notify-type input[type=checkbox]).is(":checked")
[09:29:41] <sahilsk> hello guys.  Novice, here. This plugin is working fine in Firefox,chrome but working partially in IE8. Any help would be great. http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/ksjJX/

[09:31:50] <terminal_case> I'm having a weird issue... my code works in jsfiddle, but not in firefox O.o
[09:32:01] <terminal_case> http://jsfiddle.net/gsurr326/AT3Te/3/
[09:32:18] <terminal_case> I get the "c.replace is not a function" error.
[09:36:28] <formers> terminal_case: sorry I'm not getting that error in firefox
[09:38:11] <terminal_case> formers: That's weird... what version of firefox are you using?
[09:38:39] <formers> version 5.0.1
[09:39:00] <formers> on a mac
[09:39:38] <terminal_case> Hm. I get the same thing in ChromePlus though too.
[09:40:47] <terminal_case> And in IE 9....
[09:41:54] <terminal_case> I guess it could have to do with other parts of the page, or perhaps other javscript I'm including.
[09:44:23] <faint545> I'm trying to add a class to a link when the link is clicked for my rails app but i cant seem to get it working... this is pretty much all i have: https://gist.github.com/1151979
[09:44:44] <hugolp> Im looking for a spinbox, any recommendations?
[09:47:47] <bobsomebody> after using .load() it seems that none of the previously bound events are valid, how can I remedy this situation?
[09:48:25] <m4xx> bobsomebody: can you post an example?
[09:48:57] <terminal_case> Okay, that's really weird... just an update, formers; I commented out a few lines of code in a later linked js file that extended the object prototype, and it works now.
[09:49:40] <bobsomebody> its all on localhost unfortunately
[09:49:58] <terminal_case> bobsomebody: use jsfiddle

[09:50:52] <terminal_case> hmm? oh, I see.
[09:51:00] <formers> ok cool
[09:51:13] <terminal_case> Hey, i wasn't sure I could help, I was just letting him know that's a good way to share it lol
[09:51:21] <greytrilby> hi @ajpiano - thanks for your help the other day - rewrote the code using a counter in the end (as it needed to be in a autoplay loop, but couldn't have got that far without your kind assist!
[09:51:26] <bobsomebody> its pretty simple to explain, its a listing of products, everything works for add to cart and so on, but once I load page 2, it fails
[09:51:47] <ajpiano> greytrilby: awesome :)
[09:51:50] <bobsomebody> i can no longer add things to cart, or select options in the loaded area
[09:51:55] <evinclav> terminal_case , yea, the problem is, after ajax load of page . i need to rebind form #ajax callback
[09:52:01] <evinclav> terminal_case and i dont know how : )
[09:52:06] <bobsomebody> lol
[09:52:08] <Woet> since when do div's go full width instead of just wrapping the content?
[09:52:11] <bobsomebody> hi evinclav
[09:52:22] <terminal_case> Well... nor do I lol. Sorry :/
[09:52:29] <evinclav> really need to get the beer :  )
[09:52:31] <evinclav> illbe late

[09:52:34] <evinclav> ;)
[09:53:15] <greytrilby> @evinclav - make a function that makes the links do their linky thing, and then call that function in the 'success' part of the ajax call
[09:53:34] <bobsomebody> Server not found Firefox can't find the server at www.tr.im.

[09:54:58] <evinclav> ajpiano , not it ;)
[09:55:13] <evinclav> i got it greytibly, and it might be the solution
[09:55:14] <ajpiano> lol
[10:07:25] <lduros> I'm stuck on this: if I have the following object: var TEST = { blah: { blob: function() { alert('triggered'); } } } -- (bear with brackets) -- I can acces my function like this: TEST.blah.blob() -- however, if I were to enter it for a callback? How would I call it? I tried: 'TEST.blah.blob' but I get 'TESTblahblob' is undefined. Thanks
[10:08:01] <hugolp> so no one can recommend a spinbox widget for jquery?
[10:08:32] <lduros> I should say the ajax method from which I enter the callback is within TEST.blah, so I was thinking maybe there's a way to get to the other function another way?
[10:11:31] <lduros> I guess function() { TEST.blah.blob(); } works but for some reason I can't pass the data
[10:12:35] <faint545> can JQUERY handle pop ups out of the box?
[10:12:46] <faint545> a simple popup
[10:13:58] <lduros> faint545: you mean real popups (new windows)?
[10:14:12] <faint545> lduros, yes.
[10:14:52] <e-anima> how could i trigger a function like this n pageload? http://screensnapr.com/v/Vt9T03.png
[10:14:52] <Blazento> when using jquery ui's accordion, the elements below the accordion hop up and down on the page when the accordion goes up and down... any easy way to avoid this or make it more graceful?
[10:15:17] <lduros> faint545: I have never tried to make a real popup. I usually load content in a div that's floating
[10:15:26] <lduros> popups are blocked by browsers most of the time these days
[10:15:56] <lduros> a div with css position:absolute; and on top of the rest
[10:16:53] <mosdefcc> Hi there could anyone help with a mootools query?
[10:17:03] <faint545> lduros, alright
[10:17:40] <zoned> nickserv keeps telling me incorrect password... which i highly doubt, but is there a forgot password feature?

[10:18:49] <faint545> lduros, i need to be able to render a new page though. am i able to do that with your method?
[10:18:53] <mosdefcc> it is javascript
[10:19:01] <Brodingo> then go to javascript
[10:19:03] <mosdefcc> i need some help with chain events
[10:19:53] <zoned> how can i get nickserv to send me my password? sendpass tells me i "am not authorized"
[10:20:17] <mosdefcc> ok Brodingo thanks anyhow
[10:20:25] <Brodingo> good luck

[10:32:34] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i align inline 3 tables inside tabs?
[10:32:42] <swiggy> the content for the dialog (the jquery ui tabs) is loaded via ajax, so if i put my jquery tabs init inside my ajax page - it will load correctly i assume?
[10:32:57] <swiggy> put up a fiddle and i can fuck with it for you
[10:34:57] <JacobSingh> Is there any way to respond to a change the location of a frame?
[10:35:04] <mbtez> what's the thing you're supposed to do when your browser returns a lot of "what is $" errors?
[10:35:11] <mbtez> JacobSingh:  yes
[10:35:25] <JacobSingh> mbtez: ? :) !
[10:35:28] <mbtez> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1554396/change-content-in-iframe-with-jquery
[10:35:35] <mbtez> frame or iframe.. it's probably the same
[10:35:43] <JacobSingh> mbtez: not quite
[10:35:48] <JacobSingh> I want to respond to the event
[10:35:54] <JacobSingh> so some other code is changing the src of the frame
[10:35:55] <mbtez> what event ?
[10:35:59] <JacobSingh> and I want to know when it does that
[10:36:02] <mbtez> oh
[10:36:23] <mbtez> document.write(parent.document.getElementById('ifr2').src);

[10:38:14] <janua> Hello... Would anyone be able to tell me what is wrong with this? When i click "1" it works fine. But if you run from the start and click "2", it doesn't organise like it should.. But it does if you click "1" first... http://jsfiddle.net/wSmBw/
[10:38:58] <JacobSingh> mbtez: yes, that gets it
[10:39:04] <JacobSingh> it doesn't respond to when it changes though
[10:39:06] <mbtez> nice :P
[10:39:18] <mbtez> janua: try asking in #jquery  :P
[10:39:22] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i align inline 3 tables inside tabs?
[10:39:33] <mbtez> j/k hold on
[10:39:36] <janua> mbtez: This is #jquery
[10:41:38] <mbtez> how  strange
[10:41:48] <mbtez> it seems to be assuming they have position:absolute, any idea why ?
[10:42:08] <SoulRaven> i can't use float: left or right, because when i use float, the table ar not any more inside the tabs
[10:42:11] <janua> I think it might be masonry that is doing that
[10:45:42] <mbtez> beetsme
[10:46:03] <mbtez> personally i would just do float:left and dynamically change the width
[10:46:10] <mbtez> jquery or not
[10:49:56] <bjhaid> i create a variable within a function and i need to access it within another function, how do i do this?
[10:50:22] <mbutubuntu> bjhaid, did you use var constructor?
[10:50:45] <bjhaid> mbutubuntu: yes, but even when i removed it the variables were not accesible
[10:51:20] <mbutubuntu> bjhaid, maybe a function try to get that variable before its definition...
[10:51:45] <kborchers> bjhaid: you need to declare your var outside of the scope of both functions. and don't just remove var to make it global ... global = bad
[10:51:46] <m4xx> bjhaid: you will have to either declare the variable globally or pass it as an argument to the second function.
[10:52:17] <bjhaid> mbutubuntu: let me paste my codes
[10:52:50] <mbutubuntu> kborchers, and m4xx are right
[10:53:19] <m4xx> anyone think this is user-friendly, if not how can i improve it? http://jsfiddle.net/zhrGy/
[10:54:55] <bjhaid> https://gist.github.com/1152148
[10:55:27] <m4xx> would it be better to have the first and last 15px or so trigger the scroll left and right?
[10:55:54] <bjhaid> kborchers: still from the same problem from yesterday, your approach didnt work, but i find that i can append to from the dialog search button but somehow i need to delay the append till the query results arrive
[10:57:00] <supsup> sahilsk:  a start anyway http://jsfiddle.net/5F2e9/1/  unsure what ur trying to do with that link
[10:57:51] <kborchers> bjhaid: so why not just append in the success callback of the post?
[10:59:26] <bjhaid> kborchers: how do i get that work?
[10:59:38] <kborchers> ?post @ bjhaid
[10:59:38] <bot-t> bjhaid, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:00:11] <mbutubuntu> bjhaid, did you solve the variable problem?
[11:00:14] <bjhaid> kborchers: the response comes from a messaging queue
[11:00:46] <bjhaid> mbutubuntu: the issue with the variable i think is because its value is empty @ the time the function calls it
[11:00:52] <kborchers> is that in the code you provided?
[11:01:44] <bjhaid> kborchers: yes
[11:01:57] <rns> I am looping through forms in a formset and I want to hide all but the one.  Can I do this in jquery?
[11:02:11] <mbutubuntu> bjhaid, probably
[11:02:47] <bjhaid> kborchers: the query occurs in line 61, and the response are in line 6-13
[11:03:10] <bjhaid> kborchers: i mean pickup from the queue (6-13)
[11:04:35] <mbutubuntu> is there any method to get the property of an object where value is = "someValue" ?
[11:04:39] <bjhaid> kborchers: anyway one can identify the first dialog pop-up so i can append the result to it directly?
[11:04:43] <mbutubuntu> somethink like indexOf for arrays
[11:05:05] <kborchers> bjhaid: so do you just have dialog after dialog popping up? that could get really annoying
[11:06:43] <bjhaid> kborchers: once a message is available from the queue a pop-up is shown and if a query is made another pop-up takes over it, they keep occuring as many times as a message is gotten, so i want to ensure that the query is appended into the dialog that issued the search
[11:09:08] <obscureVar> i need to "walk" an object to find out of a term is a "key" that could be multiple levels deep. any ideas?
[11:09:14] <obscureVar> *if
[11:09:41] <obscureVar> i'm hoping there is a pattern that i don't know about.
[11:11:02] <obscureVar> can you see me?

[11:13:30] <obscureVar> ajpiano: ok. thanks.
[11:18:35] <greytrilby> Oh wise jedi of the jQuery - what, in your experience, is the best way to pause a 'setInterval' function and pick up where it left off?

[11:19:32] <swiggy> i have a <form id="manageform">, and I want to set all the <input>'s on the form to value ""... what would my selector look like???    $('#manageform input').val('');  ????
[11:20:06] <kborchers> swiggy: yep, that's what i would do
[11:20:28] <swiggy> but i do not want the button's value to be null
[11:20:41] <draginx> http://pastie.org/private/mj7l291ocr06fzkwkpyja any idea why the images will *not* fade even though length > 0?

[11:25:51] <kborchers> swiggy: in case you have more than just text inputs to reset http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/6PfYg/3/
[11:27:10] <bjhaid> krborchers: any ideas on my code?
[11:27:23] <bjhaid> kborchers: any ideas on my code?
[11:28:02] <kborchers> bjhaid: nope, too confusing without seeing it working and still don't like the idea of multiple dialogs
[11:28:58] <gnarf> mbutubuntu: You mean you want to know which key in the object contains "value" ?
[11:29:02] <kborchers> swiggy: one more time ;) submit and reset input types http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/6PfYg/5/
[11:29:03] <swiggy> ty danzik17 and kborchers
[11:29:27] <swiggy> perfect

[11:29:33] <swiggy> ty
[11:29:36] <mbutubuntu> gnarf, yes
[11:29:51] <kborchers> just make sure they have an option with a "" value, i think you need that for it to work

[11:46:02] <fbarrow> Anybody here on the core team?
[11:46:24] <ajpiano> fbarrow: what's up
[11:47:01] <fbarrow> I'm about to start making a bunch of UI components in jquery, and I wanted to know if I could get them added to the UI package
[11:47:09] <fbarrow> is there any active dev on that?
[11:47:16] <ajpiano> yes, a lot
[11:47:41] <ajpiano> we don't typically accept arbitrary contributions of jquery ui widget based componenets, rather we encourage you to just realease them on your own
[11:47:51] <fbarrow> in particular the one i'm making that I hate not to share is mimic ted.com frontpage effect they have in flash but doing it in jquery
[11:47:58] <fbarrow> ok
[11:47:59] <ajpiano> we tend to go through a bit of progress and prioritisation and speccing in terms of adding components to jquery ui
[11:48:14] <kborchers> fbarrow: what are you working on? have you seen wiki.jqueryui.com?
[11:48:35] <fbarrow> nope nothing yet so thanks forthat link
[11:48:38] <fbarrow> any other resources?
[11:48:57] <ajpiano> fbarrow: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[11:49:06] <fbarrow> sweet
[11:51:06] <fbarrow> any advice on setting up a sandbox for widget dev?
[11:51:31] <ajpiano> fbarrow: you can clone the jquery ui repo and start from the functional tests
[11:52:03] <ajpiano> they have the html/js/css included all properly etc
[11:53:59] <interopcop> can anyone give me an example of how to toggle a checkbox which is identified as a child of a target checkbox?  I already have code to identify that the target checkbox has been clicked, but now I need to check the children if the parent is checked, and uncheck the children if the parent is unchecked
[11:54:25] <interopcop> http://jsfiddle.net/97stU/1/ - that's what I have
[11:55:26] <fbarrow> can you direct me to where i can find docs on how to run tests?
[11:56:17] <sean`> interopcop, http://jsfiddle.net/97stU/2/
[11:57:01] <ajpiano> fbarrow: you just go to tests/unit/index.html in a browser
[11:57:08] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit
[11:58:03] <fbarrow> yep i found it
[11:58:05] <fbarrow> sweet perfect.

[12:05:47] <melvinram> I'm trying to create an effect similar to that on http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/people/source/basic#36d8986 where when you put your mouse on an object (Trigger), it shows another object (Extended Info) . The main difference is that the Extended Info object will overlap the Trigger object and I want the user to be able to move their mouse and interact with the Extended Info object. This is what I have so far
[12:05:47] <melvinram> https://gist.github.com/17808f65a0f3e9acc4d8
[12:05:56] <rns> anyone know why my element isn't showing here? http://dpaste.com/596722/
[12:06:22] <melvinram> The problem with the above is that as soon as the mouse goes on the Extended Info object, it hides it because technically it's leaving the Trigger object
[12:06:49] <kborchers> rns: what is #selected_tenant?
[12:07:26] <melvinram> What I need is a way to detect if the mouse is currently on a particular objecgt
[12:07:27] <rns> kborchers, it's the id of my select tag
[12:08:43] <kborchers> rns: you really shouldn't show/hide options. i don't think IE plays well with that
[12:08:47] <melvinram> What I need is a way to detect if the mouse is currently on a particular object … I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1273566/how-do-i-check-if-the-mouse-is-over-an-element-in-jquery but I'm wondering if there is a better way
[12:09:31] <rns> kborchers, what are my other options?
[12:09:35] <kborchers> melvinram: why not just bind to the mouseover/mouseout events of the object. then you'll know when over or out
[12:10:09] <melvinram> kborchers: thats what I'm doing https://gist.github.com/17808f65a0f3e9acc4d8 but I need to bind it to two objects
[12:10:39] <kborchers> rns: why are you hiding and showing options?
[12:10:56] <kborchers> melvinram: what do you mean?
[12:11:11] <rns> kborchers, I am hiding/showing forms selected from a dropdown menu
[12:11:51] <melvinram> kborchers: http://www.whiteriverhurstlanding.com/ put your mouse over the About Your New Home box
[12:11:56] <kborchers> rns: wait, so you're hiding and showing forms, not the options?
[12:12:11] <rns> kborchers, yes the form itself via a div tag
[12:12:39] <kborchers> rns: are you using the same id for the div as the option? if so ... no no!
[12:13:10] <rns> kborchers, yes I am currently...how else could I do it?
[12:13:15] <kborchers> melvinram: ok, so i mouse over and it shows, what is not working right?
[12:13:42] <kborchers> rns: do you need the value of the option for anything else? why not use that?
[12:13:48] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/ECdqR/5/  <- my fiddle for table rows sortable.... it works fine it the page is not scrolled.... if I scroll lower and try drag a row, the helper (cloned row) is shown a lot higher (the scroll diff higher).... how to solve this?
[12:13:50] <melvinram> kborchers: if you mouse over, it shows but if you move your mouse into the that box, it hides it
[12:14:01] <melvinram> I think I've got a solution… let me try
[12:15:03] <Lion31> cannot demonstrate on fiddle since the content is shown in an iframe :S
[12:15:06] <rns> kborchers, sorry, that is how I have it set up now.  The div ids match the option values
[12:15:34] <kborchers> rns: well you are pulling the option id when trying to hide, not the val()
[12:16:15] <Lion31> oh, fu.cks up only in FF :S
[12:16:27] <Lion31> in chrome wrks ok
[12:17:38] <Lion31> damn in opera works fine too :S
[12:17:44] <rns> kborchers, ah thanks!  I switched it to .val() and now it works!
[12:17:45] <kborchers> melvinram: i would have var closeTimer; outside of your bindings. then in mouseleave of your new home div, do closeTimer = setTimeout(function()... and hide your div in there with a short timeout.
[12:17:47] <kborchers> then
[12:18:07] <kossakov> hi there
[12:18:24] <Lion31> but this is only for my admin.... and Iwill always use FF for it... so can somebody tell me how to avoild the mess-up in FF?
[12:18:40] <rns> kborchers, now is there a way to grab all forms to hide instead of manually listing them out?  These forms are populated dynamically
[12:18:41] <kborchers> in the mouseover of the popup div, do clearTimeout(closeTimer); which will stop it from hiding. and do your close again in the mouseout of the popup div. make sense?
[12:18:50] <kossakov> could anybody recomend me any plugin to achive anything similar to slider looking like this http://gk.24auto.pl/public/img/strazak.png ?
[12:19:05] <kborchers> $("form").hide() @ rns

[12:20:38] <ErrorMcError> I am  trying to find a way to get the servers current timestamp and its turning out to be a pain in the ass
[12:20:44] <ErrorMcError> does jquery not have any native timestamp functions?
[12:21:07] <rns> kborchers, that hides all forms on my page instead of just the ones in my formset I am working with.  Any other way?
[12:22:37] <kborchers> rns: can you show me the code?
[12:24:22] <kborchers> Lion31: what version of UI are you using?
[12:25:40] <Lion31> latest
[12:25:45] <Lion31> and I figured it out
[12:25:55] <frankstallone> exit
[12:26:04] <Lion31> overflow:auto;  <- put it to the parent element... in mycase to tbody
[12:26:06] <frankstallone> that needed a bit more than that huh =)
[12:26:17] <ErrorMcError> is it possible to get a formatted server timestamp with jquery?
[12:26:23] <Lion31> as suggested here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5791886/jquery-draggable-shows-helper-in-wrong-place-when-scrolled-down-page
[12:27:06] <rns> kborchers, here you go: http://dpaste.com/596733/
[12:28:41] <melvinram> kborchers: https://gist.github.com/17808f65a0f3e9acc4d8 for some reason it's not working. any ideas why?
[12:29:55] <kborchers> rns: try changing $('#tenant_set-1-id, #tenant_set-2-id, #tenant_set-3-id').hide(); to $(this).closest("table").find("form").hide();
[12:31:36] <kborchers> melvinram: yes, put var timeoutId; just after your $(document).ready then get rid of the var before timeoutId in other places. then change your clearTimeout's to clearTimeout(timeoutId);
[12:32:33] <_rob_> $.get('url', function(data) { console.log($(data).find('title').text()); });  // gives me the current page url instead of the title of the document I am retrieving. Any ideas?
[12:32:41] <rns> kborchers, hmm that doesn't seem to be working.  Could I just loop over all the values in my dynamically populated option list, and then hide all forms with an id matching the option value?
[12:33:19] <melvinram> kborchers: got it working. thanks.
[12:33:26] <ErrorMcError> :-(
[12:33:26] <kborchers> melvinram: np
[12:35:32] <kborchers> rns: i am confused by lines 20 through 29. why are you ending that table on line 26? what divs are you closing on lines 28 and 29?
[12:35:42] <kborchers> those numbers are in your pasted code
[12:36:28] <_rob_> $.get('url', function(data) { console.log($(data).find('title').text()); });  // gives me (an empty string) instead of the title of the document I am retrieving. Any ideas?
[12:36:32] <_rob_> ^empty string not url
[12:36:43] <_rob_> but the title is there
[12:39:37] <rns> kborchers, this should be clearer: http://dpaste.com/596738/
[12:40:06] <alaing> is there a way in jquery to detect if a user has flash and/or SVG install?
[12:41:10] <kborchers> rns: i'm sorry, what i said earlier obviously won't work :/ here's what you do
[12:41:46] <kborchers> on line 34 of your lates paste, add var formID = $(this).find('option:selected').val(); then
[12:43:22] <kborchers> that would push line 34 to 35 and 35 to 36 so then $("#"+formID).closest("table").find("form").hide(); replaces new line 35 and $("#"+formID).show(); replaces new line 36. make sense?
[12:47:28] <rns> kborchers, like this? http://dpaste.com/596743/
[12:48:14] <kborchers> rns: almost, line 34 should be $("#"+formID).closest("table").find("form").hide(); and don't forget your semicolons!
[12:49:05] <billy_ran_away> So I've got a form that my server returns a data attachment that when submitted normally prompts the browser to save the file, the thing is it can take a while to generate the file so I'd like to splash up a spinner dialog, which I've already written and use in other parts of the site.
[12:49:14] <gemclip> can someone tell me the correct syntax for this? $("ul").attr("list-style", "none");
[12:49:29] <kborchers> rns: one small change ... just a sec
[12:49:32] <billy_ran_away> So I need callbacks to start the spinner and stop the spinner, problem is the only way to provide those hooks that I know of at least is to use an Ajax request...
[12:49:49] <billy_ran_away> Which of course means JS gets the response and thus no broswer prompt.
[12:49:53] <billy_ran_away> Anyone have any suggestions?
[12:50:45] <gemclip> is "list-style" wrong?
[12:50:51] <kborchers> rns: in order for your shows to work like you have them, line 34 will need to be $(this).closest("table").find("form").each(function() { $(this).hide(); });
[12:51:33] <Nitrxgen_> probably not the best place to ask, but I need some extra eyes, can someone take a look at a document of mine? it features a DIV and an external css file, the css file is loaded but it's not applying my styles to the damn div element
[12:52:01] <Nitrxgen_> I ask to ask 'cause I want to pm the link, stuff isn't finished to be released into the wild
[12:52:06] <ErrorMcError> is there a way to get a formatted timestamp in jquery?

[12:57:39] <destinydriven> hey guys, I'm having some issues with Nivo Slider on IE8. It's skipping the first image. I have tried solutions from nivo slider faq support site and I've even tried to force browsers to use ie7 compatibility mode but still problem persists.  Link is http://stlucianic.org
[12:58:02] <rns> kborchers, hmm still doesn't seem to be working for some reason.  http://dpaste.com/596749/
[12:58:38] <kborchers> rns: do you see what is wrong with this? $(this).parent()hide();
[12:58:43] <d3str0y> nivo slider thats an image slideshow right
[12:59:28] <destinydriven> d3str0y: yes it is
[12:59:41] <rns> kborchers, sorry missed that on the paste, but still not working: http://dpaste.com/596751/
[13:00:11] <b1lly> lets say i have an event listener on a class... and than i append something to the page, after the page is loaded with that class... the event listener doesnt seem to trigger because it wasnt loaded during the initial load... is it possible to refresh the dom so that the event listener will detect the new element?
[13:00:50] <Brodingo> ?delegate @ b1lly
[13:00:51] <bot-t> b1lly, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:00:52] <danzik17> b1lly:  What you want is delegate/live:  http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:02:00] <kborchers> rns: ok, and on line 39 you should have });  you do realize that i guarantee your browser is throwing errors on all of these issues that you could debug yourself, right?
[13:04:20] <ErrorMcError> well basically i have a button that when its clicked, updates a table cell with the current timestamp but I don't see how to format it
[13:04:31] <ErrorMcError> ie: $currentRow.find("td:eq(3)").html(Date());
[13:04:49] <b1lly> danzik so i do $('body').delegate('.thisclass', 'click', function() {        //action }); ?
[13:05:02] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: Different guy here, similar question...
[13:05:11] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: Know of a way to have form submit callbacks without submitting the form with Ajax?
[13:05:15] <gemclip> can someone tell me the correct syntax for this? $("ul").attr("list-style", "none");
[13:05:19] <gemclip> is "list-style" wrong?
[13:05:25] <kborchers> ErrorMcError: that link i gave you shows you how to format the date and time in the examples
[13:05:30] <rns> kborchers, sorry I was trying to paste in that snippet without a commented line.  I actually have the closing tags in my code but it still isn't working. Any ideas? http://dpaste.com/596753/
[13:05:43] <Brodingo> billy_ran_away have the callback as a named function and jsut call it
[13:06:04] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: How do I trigger the callback?
[13:06:19] <danzik17> b1lly:  pretty much
[13:06:21] <kborchers> rns: ok, now wrap all of the code in those script tags in $(function() { ...code here... });
[13:06:23] <Brodingo> either bind it and use trigger or like this function();
[13:06:32] <eddiemonge> gemclip: use .css
[13:06:36] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: The reason I ask I have a form that a user submit that returns an xml file and using RAILs has the browser prompt with a file save as dialog.
[13:06:49] <b1lly> and even if i append an element to the page later on it will detect it and bind the event listener click to it>
[13:06:49] <Nitrxgen_> gemclip, "listStyle" maybe?
[13:07:02] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: When I use Ajax JS just shallows the whole response and the browser gets nothing...
[13:07:13] <Nitrxgen_> since you're using the JavaScript syntax, not the CSS syntax
[13:07:19] <eddiemonge> gemclip: $('ul').css('list-style', 'none');
[13:07:29] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: But it takes a while to generate the file and I'd like to display my spinner Raphael thing while they wait...
[13:07:35] <Nitrxgen_> or that
[13:07:41] <danzik17> b1lly:  Read up on 'event bubbling'.  The listener/handler is never attached directly the the elements throwing the event
[13:07:43] <Brodingo> b1lly it doesnt bind directly to the element, it bind to a parent and checks the event.target
[13:08:12] <billy_ran_away> But what parent is watching for the browser to finish with the submit response?
[13:08:28] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: Becasue remember I'm not using Ajax....
[13:08:37] <b1lly> thx
[13:08:48] <ZedPepsi> Hello guys. I have an extremely simple question. I would like the JQuery equivalent to the following thing -- by replacing alert() with JQuery's dialog. Can someone help me out? Here is the complete HTML page: <html><body><a href="#"	onclick="alert('hello, world')">beep</a>
[13:09:16] <rns> kborchers, like this? http://dpaste.com/596756/
[13:09:30] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: look at the examples/documentation for http://jqueryui.com
[13:09:37] <kborchers> yes
[13:09:47] <Brodingo> billy_ran_away so you need to set up a .submit() handler that calls ajax and that ajax has a callback
[13:09:52] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[13:10:14] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: No because the Ajax callback just shallows my response, I want the browser to handle it like it normally does
[13:10:14] <gemclip> eddiemonge: nahh didnt work
[13:10:22] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: Thanks for the suggestion. I already have, but the example is a little bit too big for me to understand completely. Which is why I've come here hoping for a real short version.
[13:10:26] <billy_ran_away> But for there to be a callback before it does handle it...
[13:10:34] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: Is that possible?
[13:10:40] <Brodingo> - _ -
[13:10:54] <rns> kborchers, for some reason this is still not working
[13:11:00] <eddiemonge> gemclip: works for me
[13:11:08] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: Yea but my other choice would be to do an Ajax request and on success dump my response and response header back to the browser
[13:11:12] <eddiemonge> gemclip: so if it doesnt work, its something else happening.
[13:11:13] <kborchers> rns: ok, then without seeing it in action, i probably can't help much more
[13:11:43] <rns> kborchers, okay thanks for the help so far
[13:12:11] <izepstan3> someone know about apache if this thing produces cookies like 0c3af6f178646b61e5ad8711c24dffcc920a0f7ds%3A5%3A%22de_de%22%3B instead of de_de
[13:12:38] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi  $('element').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('<div><p>Content</p></div>').dialog(); });
[13:12:44] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo my server's reponse is a special one that instructions to the browser to save this file... so a file save as box pops up for saving the xml file rather than display inline in the browser.  This XML is for exporting huge datasets so it takes a hot minute to generate, hence the spinners.
[13:12:54] <gemclip> eddiemonge: retarded dreamweaver
[13:13:07] <gemclip> the attr worked
[13:14:01] <gemclip> the so did the css. it was my deamweaver
[13:14:05] <eddiemonge> gemclip: you should really use css since that is a css attr and not a tag attr
[13:14:06] <richthegeek> hi, got an interesting puzzle for you all, related to $.tmpl
[13:14:23] <richthegeek> how would I do a "less than" or "greater than" without using < or > ?
[13:14:41] <clippy> it seems like youre trying to use dreamweaver for something, let me help you with that
[13:14:52] <gemclip> eddiemonge yeah I know just playing with a tutorial
[13:15:01] <eddiemonge> richthegeek: %gt;
[13:15:07] <eddiemonge> &gt; &lt;
[13:15:09] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: Thank you very much for the tip. Let me please try again -- the problem is that I've never used JQuery before and right now I'm struggling with very basic things. So for example, it says in the JQuery doc that if I do $(foo).dialog(), it will open a dialog. Clearly there has to be something else happening. What is foo? What is the simplest complete html page that would work? Is it like this? <html><body><div id="foo">hell
[13:15:20] <richthegeek> eddiemonge: ah, &gt; failed because of the ;
[13:15:30] <eddiemonge> gemclip: a tutorial told you to use attr instead of css?
[13:16:16] <gemclip> no it was doing  $("a").attr("target", "_blank"); I was jsut playing with dropping in stuff
[13:16:19] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: have you included the jquery js file, jqueryui css file and jqueryui js file?
[13:17:21] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: I'm not sure -- I include this file: jquery-1.6.2.min.js
[13:17:36] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: to use dialog, you also need to include jqueryui files.
[13:17:58] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: Ah I see. Give me a minute to get that. Do I need anything else?
[13:18:28] <gemclip> eddiemonge: thanks for the help.
[13:18:57] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: to use jqueryui you need those three files
[13:20:56] <gf3> NO U
[13:21:24] <eddiemonge> ?mlu
[13:21:24] <bot-t> much like urself
[13:21:29] <gf3> AY!
[13:22:06] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: do i need the jquery.js that came with the jquery-ui.js or can i use the one i was already using? do i dump the jquery-ui-1.8.15.custom.css file in the same directory as everything else or do I have to maintain a special directory structure? what about the images subdirectory next to the css file?
[13:22:24] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: new to web development?
[13:23:59] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: that's difficult to answer. i've done some projects over the year but my main job has nothing to do with web development -- i'm an academic. i'm just making a web app for people to do some calculations. i am a good programmer but i am certainly not a career web developer
[13:24:45] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: but i have programmed web things before. http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~loisel/kanagame/kanagame.html
[13:26:04] <jordotech> can someone quickly tell me how to round to 2 decimal places?
[13:26:22] <tbranyen> toFixed(2)
[13:26:22] <bitwise_> anyone know why building jquery is failing? i cloned the github repo and ran make. getting an error when the linting occurs
[13:26:23] <tbranyen> on your number
[13:26:30] <tbranyen> ?eval 5 .toFixed(2)
[13:26:31] <bot-t> tbranyen: "5.00"
[13:26:37] <eddiemonge> bitwise_: what error?
[13:26:47] <snover> tbranyen: the correct answer was to see ?lmgtfy javascript round decimal places
[13:26:47] <bot-t> tbranyen, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[13:26:57] <tbranyen> oh right
[13:27:03] <jordotech> thanks tbranyen
[13:27:12] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: doesnt matter where you put the files as long as you correctly state the path when referencing them
[13:27:17] <bitwise_> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/2387737
[13:27:40] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: i'm just wondering if the jquery.js files already have hardcoded paths in them
[13:28:20] <eddiemonge> ZedPepsi: there are no path references in the javascript files. the css have references to images but as long as you keep the .css file with the images folder it is fine
[13:28:45] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: ok so i have to put the images directory next to the .css file
[13:30:17] <ZedPepsi> eddiemonge: ok i'm gonna go off and try some things now. thanks for the help.
[13:44:00] <_rob_> $.get('url', function(data) { console.log($(data).find('title').text()); });  // gives me (an empty string) instead of the title of the document I am retrieving. Any ideas?
[13:44:37] <eddiemonge> _rob_: that wont work if you are returning a full html page
[13:45:00] <friedbyte> is there a selector for a div after a div#sidebar?
[13:45:05] <_rob_> eddiemonge, so it seems. but it works with other elements
[13:45:59] <_rob_> so should i just regex it before i wrap it with $() ?
[13:46:07] <_rob_> or is there a better way?
[13:46:52] <mek1> Im sending a json response back to my ,ajax success and error function, but how do I get data out of it?
[13:47:13] <mek1> I send valid json according to jsonlint
[13:47:23] <_rob_> mek1, use $.getJSON() or $.parseJSON()
[13:47:45] <kborchers> friedbyte: you mean inside #sidebar or on same level as sidebar? In: $("#sidebar > div") and same level $("#sidebar").siblings("div") or .next() if immediately after or .prev() immediately before
[13:47:48] <friedbyte> sibling was what I was looking for in case anyone cares
[13:48:11] <friedbyte> kborchers, thanks!
[13:48:16] <kborchers> np
[13:48:51] <mek1> _rob_: even from inside a .ajax function?
[13:49:14] <_rob_> mek1, inside a $.ajax() use $.parseJSON()
[13:49:18] <obscureVar> how do i: if $('.foo').text() === "bar" then set that dom element's .text() to "something else"?
[13:49:26] <_rob_> or you could use $.getJSON() instead of $.ajax()
[13:49:46] <d3str0y> someone recommend me a good crossbrowser jquery image slideshow
[13:50:15] <_rob_> d3str0y, cycle
[13:50:18] <destinydriven> d3str0y: don't go with nivo
[13:50:22] <d3str0y> jcycle
[13:50:28] <d3str0y> no nivio
[13:50:38] <d3str0y> why you say that, just because you have problems with it?
[13:52:50] <d3str0y> the JQuery Cycle Plugin webpage doesn't say anything about what browsers its compatible with
[13:52:53] <destinydriven> d3str0y: ie8 has issues with it
[13:53:32] <d3str0y> jQuery.popeye is cool too
[13:53:33] <_rob_> d3str0y, I haven't noticed any problems in any browsers with cycle, not that there aren't any, i just haven't found any
[13:53:34] <d3str0y> but has problems with IE
[13:53:46] <d3str0y> because its css3 based
[13:55:20] <mek1> _rob_: something along this way? http://dpaste.org/C8fY/
[13:55:59] <_rob_> mek1, yeah, without the alert. use console.log to view the object in firebug or chrome
[13:56:32] <mek1> Just gives me 'null'
[13:56:51] <_rob_> ah that's the error callback not success
[13:57:06] <_rob_> if the error callback is called then your json doesn't make it back to the browser
[13:57:14] <_rob_> it means there was an error in the ajax request
[13:57:17] <_rob_> check the url
[13:57:28] <mek1> I send a http 400 response to make sure it goes to the error function, i pass along a dict that validates with jsonlint as valid json, i have application/json as the mimetype
[13:57:36] <mek1> anything I missed?
[13:58:06] <bitwise_> eddiemonge: any idea on that build error?
[13:58:18] <_rob_> mek1, data isn't passed to the error callback so you need to check the xhr
[13:59:37] <rns> anyone know why this isn't hiding my elements? http://dpaste.com/596776/
[14:01:33] <kborchers> rns: does your val have the # in it? if not, you need tenant_list.push("#"+$(this).val());
[14:03:05] <_rob_> rns, assuming #tenant_list is a select, try $('#tenant_list option').each()
[14:04:32] <kborchers> rns: you should do it like $("#selected_tenant option").each(function() { $("#"+$(this).val()).hide(); }); and not even mess with the array
[14:06:11] <vinadelmar> hello. i have a qunit question: i need to write unit tests for the core of a library. i cannot imagine another way of writing them within the library core itself. because these functions are all private. so i would have to maintain two file, ex : core.js and core-test.js
[14:06:38] <vinadelmar> and try that both files contains the same code (except the unit tests for the first)
[14:06:58] <vinadelmar> is this thought flawed ?
[14:09:13] <rns> kborchers, that line worked....now to figure out how to display the selected option!
[14:10:00] <rns> ahh nevermind got it!
[14:10:18] <kborchers> cool
[14:11:00] <nullwire> I have two separate strings - from one I need to get the first character, from the other I need to get the last two characters. How can I do this?
[14:11:31] <kborchers> ?substr @ nullwire
[14:11:32] <bot-t> nullwire, caret | jQuery Plugins - IT IS UPGRADE OF THIS PROJECT: "fieldSelection" http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fieldselection Changelog: * Fixed IE bug with '\r\n' newline symbols. * Added 'setSelection' function. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/caret
[14:11:35] <kborchers> doh
[14:11:56] <kborchers> nullwire just use javascript substr
[14:12:03] <_rob_> vinadelmar, yes
[14:12:20] <rns> kborchers, is there a way to get all of my forms to hide before I even change my selection from the dropdown?
[14:12:26] <nullwire> kborchers, oooh its javascript, no wonder I couldn't find any documentation for substr. I knew it existed
[14:12:27] <nullwire> thanks
[14:12:46] <vinadelmar> _rob_, please elaborate :)
[14:13:46] <kborchers> rns: hmmm, you could cheat and just call $('#selected_tenant').change();
[14:13:49] <_rob_> vinadelmar, you don't write unit tests for private methods, only the public interface. The public interface relies on those private methods so are essentially being tested as well
[14:13:52] <shaft0> If I have a group of elements with class names with a numerical suffix (ie item-1, item-2), is there a way to find the max value of these using jquery?  They're dynamically generated, so it could be 1-5, could be 1-300, is that possible?
[14:14:42] <kborchers> shaft0: are they in the dom in order?
[14:14:55] <shaft0> Yes, they will be listed in order
[14:15:30] <shaft0> ...Sort of, actually.  There are two elements to each group (item-1, description-1, item-2, description-2)
[14:15:34] <vinadelmar> _rob_, for diverse reasons the API is also contained into the same file defining these private methods. so testings only that part of the file, should be "just fine"
[14:15:35] <vinadelmar> ?
[14:15:44] <kborchers> shaft0: try $("[class^='item-']:last")
[14:16:04] <vinadelmar> nullwire, actually the mozilla developer network has a pretty decent documentation
[14:16:21] <shaft0> kborchers: Will that return a number, or an element?
[14:16:30] <kborchers> element
[14:17:13] <rns> kborchers, that worked, thanks
[14:17:17] <kborchers> np
[14:17:44] <kborchers> shaft0: to be more precise a jQuery object containing the last element in the selection
[14:17:51] <shaft0> I want to get a number, so I can implement a loop on them, so I'd need a number for a max value, if that makes sense, though I guess I could get that element, and then get the chunk of that string with the number to get the number i need
[14:17:56] <shaft0> Yeah, that makes sense, thanks!
[14:18:34] <_rob_> shaft0, if you wanna loop through them all just use $("[class^='item-']").each()
[14:18:48] <Jarred> Hi all
[14:18:58] <Jarred> Does jquery support HTML5 <var/> tags?
[14:19:18] <shaft0> _rob_:  Cheers, that would actually work better
[14:19:29] <_rob_> Jarred, im sure you could try it and find out in about 10 seconds
[14:22:35] <rns> anyone know how I can force a selection in a dropdown?
[14:23:03] <kborchers> rns: what do you mean?
[14:23:23] <vinadelmar> rns, <option selected="selected"/> ?
[14:23:43] <rns> kborchers, well I want to store the currently selected value in a cookie and then when the form is submitted and reloaded I want to get the value of the cookie and make that the chosen option, and thus the displayed form
[14:24:08] <kborchers> $("#selectID").val(theStoredVal);
[14:28:07] <LolTheGame> ohai
[14:46:05] <rns> anyone know what's wrong with this? http://dpaste.com/596797/
[15:01:56] <shaft0> _rob_: looping through using .each was exactly what I needed, thanks!
[15:07:28] <vinadelmar> rns, try putting that code inside $(function(){ /*all your code here...*/});
[15:07:48] <bricker> Are there any elegant solutions already written for choosing event start and event end in one datepicker popup?
[15:08:11] <vinadelmar> event handlers must be set after the dom has finished to load
[15:10:17] <ray_> how can I do a math expression in the {{if}} with tmpl?
[15:35:25] <ccmonster> where is paul_irish when you need him
[15:35:44] <ccmonster> wondering how you possibly fire the html5boilerplate script process correctly from within eclipse
[15:39:46] <tomeo> hi
[15:40:22] <ccmonster> hi
[15:40:56] <tomeo> $('.toggle-menu').next('.side-menu').toggle('fast', function() {}); This is running toggle() on .toggle-menu instead of the next .side-menu as I thought it would. Doesnt next() return an object of the next .side-menu?
[15:42:43] <bricker> tomeo: next is for elements of the same type
[15:42:44] <da-beginner> how do i do a fade toggle without shifting the content beneath?
[15:43:18] <matthewmcvickar> da-beginner: You want the element on top to disappear but the element below it to stay in the same place?
[15:43:25] <ccmonster> $('.element').fadeOut().stop(true,true).toggle();
[15:43:26] <ccmonster> perhaps
[15:43:33] <da-beginner> matthewmcvickar: that's correct
[15:43:41] <bricker> tomeo: so unless you're doing .toggle-menu.side-menu it probably won't work. is side-menu inside of toggle-menu?
[15:44:27] <tomeo> bricker: no, .toggle-menu is a h3 and .side-menu a ul
[15:44:46] <da-beginner> ccmonster: not working :)
[15:45:04] <matthewmcvickar> da-beginner: That's a CSS issue, not a JS issue. There could be a lot of solutions to that problem, but the simplest would probably be a wrapper element around the top element with its height set. That way when the element inside fades in or out, anything below it won't move.
[15:45:11] <ccmonster> actually that shouldnt work, because the toggle would bring them back
[15:45:25] <ccmonster> and that's a blocking issue i believe
[15:45:45] <ccmonster> as matthewmcvickar just mentioned, if your elements are wrapped, you should be able to stop the jumpyness
[15:46:10] <da-beginner> ok thanks
[15:46:24] <ccmonster> however da-beginner , a demo is best for people to help you out
[15:46:28] <matthewmcvickar> da-beginner, ccmonster: Depending on your set up you could also absolutely position one or both of the elements that you don't want to be affected by the flow of the document
[15:46:29] <ccmonster> ?demo @ da-beginner
[15:46:29] <bot-t> da-beginner, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:47:05] <ccmonster> sure, absolute positioning would be a workaround, although maybe not ideal.
[15:47:06] <matthewmcvickar> da-beginner, ccmonster: +1 on the demo. It's difficult for us to tell what would work best in your situation without seeing exactly what you want to do.
[15:47:13] <matthewmcvickar> ccmonster: Agree.
[15:47:48] <ccmonster> fiddle that 'ish da-beginner and we can help you out much easier.
[15:47:50] <ccmonster> :)
[15:49:03] <matthewmcvickar> This might not be the right room, but I'm having issues with jPlayer in IE7. The playlist demo works on jPlayer's site but not on the site I'm using it. The page in question is this one: http://hallowbaloo.com/radio.html
[15:49:10] <bricker> tomeo: well $('.toggle-menu').next() looks for the next "sibling" of the object you gave it, in this case the next object with class 'toggle-menu'.
[15:49:24] <tomeo> oh :/
[15:50:03] <ccmonster> ?traverse @ tomeo
[15:50:04] <bot-t> tomeo, .closest() - Get the first ancestor element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:50:13] <ccmonster> ?traversing @ tomeo
[15:50:14] <bot-t> tomeo, Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[15:50:18] <ccmonster> there we go :)
[15:50:35] <tomeo> I think my elements are on the same DOM-level though
[15:50:40] <eddiemonge> bricker: actually no. it looks for the next block level element after the element with class toggle-menu
[15:50:42] <eddiemonge> ?next
[15:50:43] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:50:54] <bricker> eddiemonge: well then
[15:51:07] <bricker> eddiemonge: I misunderstood that method, thank you for correcting me
[15:51:14] <ccmonster> in firebug, if you click on the element, you can often go and see what the nextElement, or sibling, or children would be according to the dom
[15:51:16] <eddiemonge> tomeo: that was for you too
[15:51:24] <tomeo> eddiemonge: thanks
[15:51:26] <ccmonster> sometimes its easier than fiddling with different traversals
[15:51:54] <tomeo> ccmonster: nice, but firebug is outdated according to firefox :( new version today
[15:52:05] <ccmonster> you mean ff 6?
[15:52:15] <ccmonster> that wont change the dommodel
[15:52:16] <tomeo> ccmonster: yes
[15:52:34] <ccmonster> you can always just log the object to the console and get the same thing.
[15:52:43] <tomeo> no it wont, but it will force firebug to write some new code as their current version is not compatible
[15:52:43] <eddiemonge> or you can just look at the markup
[15:53:08] <ccmonster> eddiemonge, that's always the first option :)
[15:53:09] <eddiemonge> tomeo: all they have to do is change the version number. firefox hasnt changed really in terms of plugin support
[15:53:17] <tomeo> ah
[15:53:21] <ccmonster> Im assuming it isnt clear from the markup, or he's hunting and pecking
[15:54:28] <ccmonster> although, ff6 i think now includes its own web developer bar, and the firebug dev has left, i think for the google chrome team
[15:54:38] <tomeo> ccmonster: its very clear from the markup
[15:54:51] <tomeo> ccmonster: however, I can only find methods for getting parents or children
[15:54:57] <ccmonster> ah, well then just pick the right selector and or traverser
[15:55:02] <ccmonster> :)
[15:55:02] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: joe hewitt left a long time ago.
[15:55:16] <ccmonster> couple months back , right?
[15:55:36] <eddiemonge> like a couple of years ago
[15:55:55] <ccmonster> umm..i thought i saw something about the main firebug dev leaving just recently.
[15:56:06] <tomeo> two block elements after each other are considered siblings right? even if they are not the same type of tag
[15:56:23] <eddiemonge> tomeo: right
[15:57:14] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: he left facebook recently
[15:57:15] <amirite> whats the correst/most correct way to extend a jquery ui widget? for example, i want to customize the autocomplete widget because i use a very complex set of very similar parameters in multiple places throughout my application
[15:58:26] <ccmonster> yes, and JUST recently, as in last month said he's no longer working on firebug
[15:59:25] <ccmonster> just return the widget, and then attach to the events.
[15:59:40] <amirite> not sufficient
[15:59:46] <amirite> i'm hacking it at a low level
[15:59:56] <amirite> i need to either extend it or rewrite it
[16:00:14] <amirite> so i ask again, is there a correct or best way to extend jUI widgets
[16:00:17] <eddiemonge> amirite: have you looked at the example on the examples page? it shows how to do it with the custom autocomplete
[16:00:40] * amirite checks
[16:00:42] <amirite> thanks for the tip
[16:01:06] <ccmonster> which example are you referring to eddiemonge ?
[16:01:16] <ccmonster> custom data & display?
[16:01:28] <amirite> do you have a link eddie?
[16:01:41] <ccmonster> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[16:01:45] <ccmonster> perhaps he means that one?
[16:02:19] <ccmonster> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Developer_Guide
[16:02:25] <amirite> im reading there
[16:02:42] <ccmonster> good luck
[16:03:48] <DrkShadow> Is there any way to "fake" the base URL of the page I'm at? I'm at tests/assembly.html, which runs javascript out of ../inc/js/... but the issue is that, even if I change src= in the <script> lines, those pages reference code from ../ and I can't change the paths.
[16:04:39] <DrkShadow> Can't come up with any good way to do it without a tests/ subdirectory, as I really need specific HTML to do some of the tests.
[16:05:07] <eddiemonge> DrkShadow: use absolute paths:  http://domain.com/path/to/your/files
[16:05:28] <bitwise_> base tag maybe?
[16:05:40] <DrkShadow> gawd, maybe I should just find a way to load javascript into the page if I click a special area 3 times that'll run the tests..
[16:06:06] <bitwise_> <base href="..." />
[16:08:20] <DrkShadow> hmm..
[16:10:16] <DrkShadow> base definitely works.. thanks :-)
[16:10:48] <nul0op> hello guys. trying to do drag & drop between two browser windows.
[16:11:13] <nul0op> if i only call ".attr('draggable', 'true')" on the source element. it's ok, the element can cross browser window
[16:11:30] <nul0op> but if I use '.draggable({ helper: 'original' })', it doesn't ...
[16:11:55] <nul0op> is there any magic there ?
[16:48:01] <aroman> if I connected to change() on an <input> that was a radio, every time the radio selection is called each of the radios should cause change() to be emitted, right?
[16:48:36] <aroman> err, actually, just the other radio that was selected
[17:22:18] <DrkShadow> I have an object, and I want to select all input nodes anywhere underneath it: $(object).children('input') -- but that jquery selects only input nodes that are children. How can I select all descendant input nodes?
[17:24:06] <deadlyicon> does anyone know where in the jQuery source live events are triggered?
[17:24:55] <DrkShadow> .find..
[17:25:35] <ndss56> i have <p>some text goes here</p> that i want to make fade and then dissapear in like 5 secs
[17:25:41] <ndss56> how is this done?
[17:26:15] <coldhead> deadlyicon: is it not the line trigger: function( event, data, elem, onlyHandlers ) {
[17:26:17] <coldhead> ?
[17:26:43] <coldhead> ndss56: $('p').fadeOut(5000)
[17:26:47] <coldhead> ?fadeout
[17:26:48] <bot-t> .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[17:26:59] <ndss56> coldhead: thanks.
[17:28:07] <ndss56> coldhead: fading to transparent means its still in the html?
[17:28:19] <coldhead> yes
[17:28:39] <coldhead> $('p').fadeOut(5000, function () {$(this).remove();})
[17:29:22] <ndss56> coldhead: does that remove text only or removes the <p>'s as well?
[17:29:40] <coldhead> it removes the entire p
[17:29:55] <ndss56> coldhead: ok i just want to remove the text.
[17:30:03] <coldhead> $('p').fadeOut(5000, function () {$(this).empty();})
[17:30:35] <andrun> please help me http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7092070/convert-prototype-ajax-responders-to-jquery
[17:30:35] <ndss56> coldhead: thanks.
[17:31:28] <deadlyicon> does anyone know where in the jQuery source live events are triggered?
[17:31:36] <deadlyicon> *where
[17:32:49] <coldhead> deadlyicon: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L277
[17:32:52] <coldhead> is that not it?
[17:35:35] <jaequery> hola
[17:38:09] <coldhead> if anyone has me /ignored please let me know, so i won't bother talking to you
[17:38:09] <coldhead> thx
[17:42:27] <ndss56> coldhead: i'm noticing some css changes when using $('p').fadeOut(5000, function () {$(this).empty();}). <-- does this effect css?
[17:45:31] <coldhead> ndss56: the fadeOut is done by manipulating the CSS, yes
[17:45:46] <coldhead> you will need to do $('p').show() to restore it
[17:48:10] <DrkShadow> javascript must have no concept of a call stack.. otherwise, given that and all the variables that are copied around, it would be _huge_..
[17:55:38] <ndss56> coldhead: so it overrides my css for <p>?
[17:57:34] <coldhead> ndss56: only the opacity
[17:57:57] <coldhead> and i /think/ it might change display to block if it isn't already
[17:58:04] <coldhead> but p should be display:block anyway
[18:01:14] <ndss56> coldhead: just noticing a couple of changes. the spacing in p is increased and font is different.
[18:05:56] <coldhead> ndss56: that's not usual jQuery behaviour
[18:06:21] <coldhead> ndss56: link us to a demo?
[18:06:57] <vmassuchetto> I'm using AJAX to insert some HTML into an initial document. Is there any way of also mapping the elements on the inserted section through jQuery's selectors?
[18:07:48] <ndss56> coldhead: im guessing its because i havent set a style for p so maybe its using a query default. i'll see if i can override it first.
[18:09:03] <coldhead> ndss56: jquery ain't got no business with your style, it just changes what it needs to. it's usually just the opacity. everything else should remain as it is, even if it's just the browser default
[18:09:52] <filipiz> Guys... do you know to explain what's the difference between promisse.pipe(...) and promisse.then(...)?
[18:10:37] <filipiz> the promisse.pipe(...) return another promisse... and then dont...  is that?
[18:21:01] <ndss56> coldhead: yes you are right. but i do notice something odd. i have border around <p> after fadeOut() the text + border fades away. but when i do show() the border does it reappear.
[18:21:20] <ndss56> *does not reappear.
[18:22:20] <DrkShadow> fade and show should only set display and opacity. Shouldn't affect border.. shouldn't..
[18:23:22] <ndss56> DrkShadow: apparently does.the fadeOut is applied to <p> so everything fades.
[18:24:17] <ndss56> might have to put a nested <span> to hold text and fade that instead.
[18:25:30] <DrkShadow> that won't fade the border.
[18:26:08] <ndss56> i dont want border to fade thats the point. i will put border around <p>.
[18:26:44] <ndss56> i just found it odd that border didn't reappear after show()
[18:27:01] <ndss56> when i originally set fadeOut on <p>
[18:27:42] <DrkShadow> that is odd..
[18:28:23] <ndss56> DrkShadow: yup.. anyway history now. moving on.
[18:30:00] <DrkShadow> I _HATE_ writing tests for GUI software.
[18:31:59] <ndss56> why can't you test the GUI directly?
[18:33:51] <ndss56> <p><span class="foo"></span></p>
[18:34:20] <ndss56> when i set fadeOut() on span. it doesn't fade but it does dissappear after 5 secs.
[18:34:28] <ndss56> lol
[18:34:59] <coldhead> ndss56: my guess is that the border isn't drawn around an empty element
[18:36:21] <ndss56> coldhead: what has border around span have to do with it not fading? there is a border around <p>
[18:38:25] <abjorn> ...
[18:38:28] <abjorn> every now and then
[18:38:29] <abjorn> at work
[18:38:36] <abjorn> we get someone in support chat who comes in and asks
[18:38:50] <coldhead> i don't know, ndss56, it's my first day
[18:38:52] <abjorn> "When does the narwhal bacon?"
[18:39:00] <abjorn> and then leaves
[18:39:04] <abjorn> and gives a bad arting
[18:40:08] <ndss56> coldhead: first day? you seem to know alot about jQuery.
[18:40:58] <abjorn> coldhead is a total noob
[18:42:53] <RobW> how do I stop a div that uses .load from resizing to 0?
[18:42:59] <RobW> and/or auto resize to fit content..
[18:43:27] <iateadonut> when using $.ajax, how do i take the response and turn it into a variable that can be used outside of $.ajax?
[18:43:36] <iateadonut>  success: function(msg) { ... } ?
[18:43:38] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/eywKS/1/ <-- test case: does not fade out
[18:44:22] <RobW> iateadonut: have a global variable... var myGlobal = ''; $.ajax(url, function(msg) { myGlobal = msg }); ?
[18:44:36] <ndss56> abjorn: if hes a total noob then i'm the king of noobs.
[18:44:39] <abjorn> ew, global variable?
[18:44:47] <abjorn> pls no
[18:45:00] <RobW> abjorn: he clearly said outside of the $.ajax scope
[18:45:04] <iateadonut> RobW, thanks.
[18:45:15] <RobW> iateadonut: you can also pass msg to another function if you don't want to use a global..
[18:45:17] <abjorn> so?
[18:45:18] <Lampoon> so are you
[18:45:24] <abjorn> global isn't the only scope out there bro
[18:45:30] <RobW> ndss56: fades out for me ;\
[18:45:54] <ndss56> RobW: right then it must be an IE8 issue.
[18:46:07] <abjorn> put it in a function scope or namespace it preferably.
[18:46:12] <abjorn> avoid global variables
[18:46:36] <coldhead> ndss56: it's been a long day
[18:46:43] <abjorn> coldhead you're a jquery noob amirite?
[18:46:46] <RobW> ndss56: set span to display: block
[18:46:49] <coldhead> first day, abjorn
[18:46:53] <abjorn> day 1
[18:46:57] <coldhead> how's hostgator?
[18:46:57] <RobW> or inline-block
[18:46:57] <abjorn> dawn of the first day
[18:46:59] <ndss56> RobW: will do
[18:48:01] <ndss56> RobW: it works now but the font is totally whack, its like insanely bold/pixelated.
[18:48:11] <abjorn> it's prett cool, coldhead
[18:48:23] <abjorn> ive been waiting forever on getting word about whether i got the html/css dev position yet tho
[18:48:34] <RobW> ndss56: you may have to adjust your css accordingly
[18:48:55] <ndss56> RobW: that was seen in jsfiddle.
[18:49:05] <abjorn> the creative lead there said he liked my work but wanted to give me a project to test me on, been waiting for like 2 weeks on that
[18:49:52] <RobW> idk.
[18:51:17] <ndss56> RobW: anyway, i think your awesome.
[18:53:08] <iateadonut> how can i pass msg to another function?
[18:54:12] <iateadonut> i'm actually using ajax within a function.
[18:54:51] <iateadonut> which otherwise has no problem changing the value of var same3 = 2; defined at the beginning of the script (global variable)?
[18:55:19] <iateadonut> but within $.ajax, i can't get same3 to be defined as msg, and then able to be used just outside of $.ajax within that same function.
[18:55:37] <IMTheNachoMan> what is the correct event to attach to an input to fire everytime the user types osmething?
[18:55:37] <abjorn> of course, it's asynchronous
[18:55:55] <abjorn> the callback in $.ajax is going to be called after that function has already completed
[18:55:57] <abjorn> in almost every case
[18:56:21] <iateadonut> ah.
[18:56:51] <iateadonut> so what do i do about that?
[18:56:57] <abjorn> Writing asynchronous code takes some getting used to, especially if you're used to using other programming languages with no concept of asynchronous programming.
[18:57:15] <abjorn> You do what you need to do with it in the callback function.
[18:57:26] <iateadonut> ok.
[18:57:27] <iateadonut> thanks.
[18:57:30] <abjorn> np
[18:57:47] <RobW> does anyone know why an $("div").load() call makes that div have a height of 0?!?
[18:58:34] <abjorn> it doesn't, but your callback in the event might
[18:59:51] <RobW> $("div").slideUp('fast', function() { $(this).load(url, function() { $(this).slideDown(); }); });
[18:59:55] <bananasontoast> Is anyone here familiar with the jQuery UI Tooltip that is currently being built? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tooltip
[18:59:57] <RobW> ^- that's really it.. :\
[19:00:12] <bananasontoast> I am having troubles with making some changes and I know it's a newbie error, just need some help
[19:00:34] <abjorn> Make sure the callback for .load() is being called at all
[19:00:36] <abjorn> it probably isn't
[19:01:02] <RobW> it is.
[19:01:23] <abjorn> got a jsfiddle for it?
[19:01:31] <RobW> seriously, the height is being set to 0... in firebug there's no explicit property for this, but the layout tab shows 0
[19:01:43] <RobW> sec I'll try to make a jsfiddle ex
[19:01:52] <abjorn> k
[19:02:55] <IMTheNachoMan> what is the difference in $(element).data(…)   and element["…"] = '''
[19:04:20] <abjorn> .data() value's aren't stored as a variable on the dom elemetn
[19:04:26] <abjorn> element, even
[19:04:53] <eon1> I think I found a bug in one of the demos on jqueryui.com for the datepicker...
[19:05:10] <abjorn> well, okay, it is KIND of stored as a variable on the dom element
[19:05:15] <abjorn> it sets a property on the element
[19:05:22] <IMTheNachoMan> so whats the benefit from one over the otehr?
[19:05:22] <abjorn> data-varname="value"
[19:05:31] <IMTheNachoMan> except the event properties...
[19:06:57] <eon1> in this demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range , when you click on one of the dates it clears the anchor string from the page's url
[19:07:13] <eon1> but in all the other demos clicking on dates leaves the anchor string intact
[19:09:21] <RobW> abjorn: http://jsfiddle.net/d6mhg/
[19:09:51] <RobW> agh wait, jsfiddle decided not to return anything 1 sec
[19:10:25] <RobW> let me just upload the files.
[19:10:58] <abjorn> I thought you were using .load somewhere
[19:11:15] <RobW> see pm
[19:11:43] <coldhead> lol cyber
[19:14:37] <abjorn> you know it coldhead
[19:20:20] <bartmax> if I have a $(selector).each(function() {$(this).find('a.somelink').click(function() {// do something})); later I create a new DOM element that matches the 'selector' and I want the click to work like if it was a 'live' binding. is that possible using $.each or should I change the select logic ?
[20:20:28] <erretrert> hihihiihi
[21:06:37] <shripad> hello :)
[21:07:06] <shripad> is it possible to use $.get along with $.proxy?
[21:07:56] <Cork> shripad: proxy is just a scope function, it doesn't really change anything for ajax
[21:08:08] <Cork> shiawuen: but it depends on what you want to do
[21:08:24] <Cork> *shripad
[21:08:35] <shripad> how then would i change the scope of 'this' inside an ajax callback?
[21:08:49] <Cork> you can't
[21:09:09] <Cork> you would have to store the this variable in a temp variable in the proxy
[21:09:19] <shripad> hmm... isn't that a bit restricting? :)
[21:09:35] <Cork> its how this variables work in javascript
[21:09:44] <Cork> not much jquery can do about that
[21:10:28] <shripad> you can change the scope of this inside ajax callback... is it a design decision by the jquery core team to exclude this functionality?
[21:11:22] <shiawuen> function makeCB(thisObj, fn){ return function(){ fn.apply(thisObj, [].slice.call(arguments)) } }
[21:11:39] <shiawuen> that way you can control the this obj of the callback
[21:12:08] <shripad> perfect! thanks shiawuen :)
[21:12:58] <shiawuen> I accidentally get pull in =\
[21:28:29] <gnarf> ?jQuery.proxy @shiawuen
[21:28:30] <bot-t> shiawuen, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[21:29:18] <gnarf> Cork: also, incorrect, the ajax has a context option
[21:29:21] <gnarf> ?jQuery.ajax
[21:29:22] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:29:46] <gnarf> context: This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks. By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax). For example specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for the complete callback of a request, like so:
[21:30:02] <shiawuen> gnarf: I not always have/need jQuery, so I need to self make some helper that just do the things I needed it to do
[21:30:29] <Cork> gnarf: ah, true i forgot that one
[21:30:37] <gnarf> shiawuen: awesome, just pointing out that you're in a jQuery support channel so rather than suggesting writing some code they already have, you might want to suggest the jQuery method that does it
[21:31:32] <shiawuen> gnarf: honestly, I never use the $proxy before =P
[21:31:36] <gnarf> but that guy who actually needed that problem solved already left
[21:31:56] <gnarf> shiawuen: well now you know you have it
[21:31:59] <gnarf> shiawuen: ;)
[21:32:26] <gnarf> and maybe next time you're in a jQuery environment and have need to write your own function again, you'll remember it
[21:32:32] <shiawuen> gnarf: I keep things simple
[21:32:58] <opius> after i have done a load, how do i access the data immediatly afterwards? $('#errorConsole').append($('#loadTest').text()); gives me nothing
[21:34:01] <gnarf> opius: you don't you access the data in the callback for load
[21:34:01] <Cork> opius: use the complete callback in the load call
[21:34:03] <shiawuen> opius: $('#sth').load(url, function(){ /* try your work here */ })
[21:34:21] <gnarf> the load hasn't happened "immediately after"
[21:34:25] <kenperkins> has this bitten anyone else?
[21:34:26] <gnarf> it has to wait for load to finish
[21:34:27] <kenperkins> http://www.clipboard.com/clip/LR58kGbzAllnhW_M
[21:34:39] <opius> then this gets a bit complicated :P
[21:34:48] <gnarf> kenperkins: setting shorthand should work
[21:34:57] <gnarf> kenperkins: animating shorthand will not
[21:35:07] <gnarf> kenperkins: reading shorthand also will be inconsistent
[21:35:20] <kenperkins> we were reading it and running into lots of problems
[21:35:25] <gnarf> opius: no it doesn't
[21:35:30] <kenperkins> (inconsistencies as you say)
[21:35:50] <opius> gnarf, well. im a beginner
[21:35:50] <gnarf> kenperkins: "expected"
[21:35:55] <kenperkins> :)
[21:36:01] <gnarf> opius: well, the first "a" in AJAX is asyncronus
[21:36:11] <gnarf> asynchronus*
[21:36:11] <kenperkins> I'm just happy the linked worked for you gnarf
[21:36:19] <opius> yeah :)
[21:36:40] <gnarf> kenperkins: really tho, you shouldn't be reading shorthand props
[21:36:49] <shiawuen> how about hack like do setTimeout to check again and again? @gnarf @kenperkins
[21:36:51] <kenperkins> yea, we changed our code
[21:36:58] <gnarf> shiawuen: horrible design
[21:37:02] <shiawuen> :P
[21:37:05] <gnarf> opius: see ?p
[21:37:06] <bot-t> opius, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:37:12] <shiawuen> but it works for me :D
[21:37:14] <gnarf> show me what you got
[21:37:19] <gnarf> or tried and failed
[21:37:32] <gnarf> shiawuen: ever hear of race conditions?
[21:37:47] <gnarf> you have an event that will be exectued when your request finishes, use it
[21:38:05] <gnarf> using a setTimeout to guess how long its gonna take is just dumb
[21:38:06] <shiawuen> well…i used it only if the things really really f*ck up
[21:38:10] <shiawuen> normally callback will do
[21:38:28] <gnarf> callback will ALWAYS do
[21:38:35] <gnarf> if it doesn't then you have another error
[21:38:40] <gnarf> you just don't know it yet
[21:38:48] <shiawuen> gnarf: even css animation?
[21:39:17] <gnarf> shiawuen: there are browser events for property animation completion
[21:39:23] <opius> http://jsfiddle.net/PJHmx/
[21:39:24] <opius> :P
[21:39:40] <shiawuen> gnarf: where ?
[21:40:26] <opius> most of the code is from a chat ui i found
[21:41:38] <gnarf> shiawuen: "transitionEnd"
[21:41:45] <gnarf> or rather transitionend
[21:41:57] <gnarf> but its vendor prefixed
[21:42:03] * gnarf hunts for nimbus slides
[21:43:00] <gnarf> http://nimbu.in/txjs/#slide17
[21:43:22] <gnarf> right arrow through it
[21:43:23] <gnarf> its slides
[21:43:48] <gnarf> prefixed OTransitionEnd webkitTransitionEnd and mozTranisitionEnd i think
[21:44:08] <shiawuen> gnarf: wonder how I missed it =\
[21:45:00] <gnarf> shiawuen: welcome to life on the edge
[21:45:14] <gnarf> I wouldn't know if I weren't giving a presentation on animation at jqcon
[21:45:21] <gnarf> :)
[21:45:25] <shiawuen> too much channel to follow =\
[21:46:08] <gnarf> I'm working on a wrapper for jQuery UI AnimateClass & CSS Transitions
[21:46:20] <gnarf> as the main demo of the presentation
[21:46:31] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[21:46:55] <androoid> where at
[21:46:57] <shiawuen> btw…for opius code, wouldn't it work if the following code move into the callback for the .load() ?
[21:47:31] <shiawuen> I meant the the code after the .load()
[21:48:49] <shiawuen> gnarf: any estimate of the release?
[21:48:55] <opius> $("#loadTest").load('get.aspx?userId=' + $('#<%= FindControl("hiddenId").ClientID %>').val(),loadBoxes); ... then created a function called loadBoxes with the code inside.. that didn't work.
[21:48:59] <Adman65> anyone know of a plugin that will generate N colors for labeling? Not random colors but  shades ?
[21:49:02] <gnarf> shiawuen: before my presentation? :)
[21:49:05] <gnarf> oct 1
[21:49:27] <gnarf> opius: where did you define loadBoxes
[21:49:30] <gnarf> cuz thats a good pattern
[21:49:32] <shiawuen> gnarf: I didn't when is jqconf
[21:49:34] <gnarf> and define "doesn't work"
[21:49:41] <gnarf> ?jqconf
[21:49:44] <bot-t> gnarf, #5516 (Make submit, change and select events compatible with .live ... - Opened 21 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5516
[21:49:45] <shiawuen> too far for me to attend =(
[21:49:59] <gnarf> http://events.jquery.org/2011/boston/speakers/
[21:50:02] <opius> gnarf, ill post the new code
[21:50:48] <gnarf> also
[21:50:56] <gnarf> is that ASP in the middle of JS?
[21:51:00] <gnarf> or even ruby?
[21:51:03] <gnarf> if so i will punch you
[21:51:07] * gnarf raises a fist
[21:51:07] <shiawuen> looks like ASP.NET
[21:51:17] <opius> http://jsfiddle.net/PJHmx/1/
[21:51:20] <opius> asp.net yes
[21:51:43] <shiawuen> <%= FindControl("hiddenId").ClientID %> = ASP.EVIL
[21:51:50] <gnarf> horrible idea
[21:51:58] <wkmanire> Whats he trying to do?
[21:52:00] <opius> im just grabbing a control's name..
[21:52:08] <wkmanire> find an element rendered in an INaminingContainer?
[21:52:10] <gnarf> still horrible idea :)
[21:52:19] <wkmanire> INamingContainer*
[21:52:27] <gnarf> but
[21:52:28] <opius> im not that smart :P
[21:52:29] <opius> :)
[21:52:41] <gnarf> well, take my advice, don't put that code in your js file
[21:52:54] <gnarf> also
[21:53:06] <shiawuen> gnarf: if he dont do that, he basically cant get the ID
[21:53:12] <gnarf> rather than var loadBoxes = function() you can function loadBoxes() {
[21:53:16] <shiawuen> though he still can use calss
[21:53:20] <shiawuen> class*
[21:53:34] <opius> im a moron and defined the function in the wrong place ? ..
[21:53:39] <opius> hehe
[21:53:41] <gnarf> opius: nope
[21:53:45] <gnarf> its in the right place i think
[21:53:48] <gnarf> some other tips
[21:53:56] <gnarf> "this" in the load callback should be #loadTest
[21:54:12] <gnarf> try console.log( $(this).text() );
[21:54:17] <gnarf> or even console.log ( this );
[21:54:21] <gnarf> debug your stuff
[21:54:23] <gnarf> ?ftj
[21:54:23] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[21:55:00] <gnarf> since "doesn't work" is a really big definition
[21:55:20] <opius> when you brought it up, firebug won't work for me anymore..
[21:55:26] <opius> get some error
[21:55:26] <gnarf> maybe even just console.log( this, arguments ) so you can see a) the "this" b) the "arguments"
[21:55:31] <gnarf> opius: i suggest chrome anyway
[21:55:36] <gnarf> chrome dev tools are hot
[21:55:39] <gnarf> and built in
[21:55:44] <opius> ohh..
[21:56:00] <gnarf> you'll still have to fix your firebug problem someday though
[21:56:12] <gnarf> because you need to test in like 5 browsers if you really wanna make sure things are working
[21:56:47] <gnarf> also
[21:56:53] <gnarf> is .load() getting HTML?
[21:57:51] <opius> yes, but im generating a textstring on an empty page
[21:58:18] <gnarf> its html tho right? like you are actually displaying the content?
[21:58:26] <gnarf> if not, don't use .load() :)
[21:58:27] <opius> yes
[21:58:29] <gnarf> k
[22:01:11] <notwen> hi - could someone help me with a piece of jqueryui autocomplete code? I've done as the demo shows but I can't seem to get it to work (retrieves data, does not drop down)
[22:03:17] <gnarf> ooo, they posted the schedule for the talks :)
[22:05:44] <david542> hi, in a slideshow, how would I get the class of the image being faded in? for example: http://dpaste.com/597000/
[22:09:15] <opius> i need like 2h sleep, been up way to long to grasp anything of this atm. but thanks for the help gnarf. ill start debugging when i wake up :)
[22:09:46] <jellosea> does anybody know of a plugin that lets me automatically add more textboxes if i add text to one?
[22:10:16] <saganbyte> jellosea, why do you need a plugin for that
[22:10:29] <jellosea> i mean just one that is packaged well
[22:10:38] <jellosea> like with an (x) that lets me delete a line
[22:10:40] <saganbyte> you can just append a textbox each time someone adds text
[22:10:41] <jellosea> of textboxes
[22:11:30] <saganbyte> jellosea, do you want to add textboxes or delete em?
[22:11:48] <jellosea> both, i have a textbox and list pair
[22:11:57] <jellosea> and if i fill that up, i want it to generate another pair
[22:11:59] <jellosea> and so on
[22:12:11] <jellosea> but also it would be nice if i dont want one of them i can click an x and have those get deleted
[22:12:19] <jellosea> get the pair deleted
[22:12:29] <jellosea> does that make sense
[22:12:51] <saganbyte> all i know that all this is very possible, just needs some more clarity
[22:13:20] <saganbyte> do you have something online that probably doesnt work but is online
[22:13:20] <jellosea> saganbyte: yeah its definitely possible
[22:13:31] <jellosea> no i don't, i know how to do this myself too
[22:13:40] <saganbyte> i see
[22:13:43] <jellosea> i just want to know if there is some sort of pguin/example
[22:13:49] <jellosea> taht i can use instead of writing it myself
[22:13:49] <david542> hi, could someone please help me out with how to get the class of an element fading in?
[22:14:10] <saganbyte> my personal opinion is to NOT add more js files when you can do it with a few lines of lean code
[22:15:04] <saganbyte> david542, what event caused the element to fade in?
[22:15:28] <david542> saganbyte: thanks for the response. it's a basic slideshow -- http://dpaste.com/597000/
[22:15:39] <david542> and I'm trying to fade in/out the buttons at the same time as the image
[22:17:05] <saganbyte> david542, i think there is a property to check if an item is being animated
[22:17:08] <saganbyte> if( $(elem).is(':animated') )
[22:18:14] <david542> hmm
[22:18:27] <david542> how would I apply that to the slideshow to get that
[22:18:54] <saganbyte> david542, you could probably run a loop on th items on .gallery-slider elements
[22:19:17] <david542> you mean just set the duration the same?
[22:19:26] <david542> or loop it based upon the image being active?
[22:29:47] <coalhead> talk at you later, da-beginner
[22:39:01] <MagBo_htc> o/ want to stream <script>s through iframe to fake server push. is it possible? my current implementation works but has a huge delay
[22:41:26] <MagBo_htc> another question (minor) -- how to prevent page from using loading animations during iframe streaming?
[22:43:05] <saganbyte> if( $("body").find("iframe") ) $(".preloader').hide()
[22:44:30] <Cork> MagBo_htc: your prob better of with long pulls
[22:44:54] <Cork> loading data through an iframe has some annoying encoding problems
[22:47:43] <MagBo_htc> well, I have rather funny web server and I have implemented multipart data handling plus forking and manipulating a process to stream <script>s over http.
[22:48:41] <MagBo_htc> I was surprised that they don't execute at the moment when they are received by the browser
[22:49:33] <MagBo_htc> simply don't want to lose the code I've already written. but if you have a better idea -- can you explain a bit?
[22:50:30] <MagBo_htc> just to be sure that we understand each other -- I need a way to manipulate the page based on erlang events in the system.
[22:50:34] <Cork> MagBo_htc: just set the server timeout to a farly high number and use ajax
[22:50:53] <Cork> MagBo_htc: when you get a complete or error just open a new connection
[22:51:09] <Cork> (also calld comet)
[22:52:07] <MagBo_htc> I'm more serverside guy and actually don't have much experience in js, dom and html processing. just was trying to implement an oldschool idea basing on common sense
[22:53:01] <Cork> MagBo_htc: additionally theres another problem with keeping a iframe open and pushing script over it
[22:53:06] <Cork> and thats memory consumption
[22:53:08] <MagBo_htc> Cork, eh, okay. so I'll use xmlhttp right?
[22:53:17] <Cork> yes
[22:55:07] <coalhead> or use flash
[22:55:14] <coalhead> a lot of people are doing that now
[22:55:30] <MagBo_htc> no wai
[22:55:52] <Cork> ya, until websockets comes
[22:55:57] <MagBo_htc> Cork
[22:56:03] <Cork> (comes to you can relay on it)
[22:56:14] <MagBo_htc> 's idea sounds good
[22:57:01] <MagBo_htc> yeah. websockets are great and really basic idea.
[22:57:33] <MagBo_htc> I was really surprised that they aren't implemented yet.
[22:57:46] <Cork> MagBo_htc: what i decribed is fundamentally what server-sent-events implements
[22:58:01] <coalhead> we still haven't cured the common cold
[22:58:07] <coalhead> or put a woman on the moon
[22:58:13] <Cork> MagBo_htc: they are, but it has had some major security bumps, so its been disabled for quite some time
[22:58:14] <MagBo_htc> ))
[22:58:18] <Dravekx> Hi.
[22:58:45] <Cork> MagBo_htc: but the new 08 revision looks like it will stick
[22:58:58] <MagBo_htc> xtc, I need you ))
[22:59:11] <Cork> though it will prob take around 15-20 years until you can count on it :/
[23:00:15] <MagBo_htc> Cork, ok, I'll rewrite my serverside code to serve stuff VIA ajax
[23:01:01] <MagBo_htc> but do you have an idea about why that iframe guy wasn't working as an instant push-console?
[23:01:51] <Cork> MagBo_htc: this is skraping from the back of my mind, so this might have some misses in it
[23:02:19] <MagBo_htc> hopefully I won't write web soft in that twenty years.
[23:02:40] <Cork> MagBo_htc: but if i remeber correctly; if you stream data through a normal http stream, the browser (at least some) will run the scripts when the stream data goes over x kb in size
[23:03:20] <Cork> MagBo_htc: so you have to add trailing padding in the stream after the script tags so that the browser parses it
[23:03:24] <Cork> or something like that
[23:03:28] <MagBo_htc> sounds like the behaviour I was facing.
[23:03:57] <MagBo_htc> trailing padding?
[23:03:57] <Cork> the thing is, all those script tags AND the padding stays in memory until the page stops loading
[23:04:06] <Cork> so you have a potentally big memory hog there
[23:04:43] <Cork> MagBo_htc: ya you add the <script></script> tags and then x space characters just so theres enough data sent to trigger the parser
[23:04:46] <MagBo_htc> ah, you mean tons of useless info?
[23:04:52] <Cork> yes
[23:05:20] <Dravekx> how can I add toggle to this so the button stays down when clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/PBACV/
[23:05:31] <Cork> so you would have to reload the iframe on intervals just to free up the memory
[23:05:37] <MagBo_htc> oh, that clearly is a bad practice. thanks for your help. that was really useful.
[23:09:53] * coldhead nosebleed
[23:10:38] <Dravekx> anyone have a clue...
[23:10:41] <Dravekx> lol
[23:12:17] <Cork> Dravekx: use a class instead of :hover/:active
[23:12:44] <Cork> then toggle it with addClass/removeClass or toggleClass
[23:14:38] <Dravekx> Cork, ok :)
[23:15:43] <MagBo_htc> Cork lol, I've declared variable Shit and appending it to each <script> guy. and the module works ))
[23:16:09] <Cork> :)
[23:16:15] <MagBo_htc> I've got my fun, now it's time to rewrite everything.
[23:41:33] <simulation> hello guys, how can i copy the select elemet with the selection to another select element ? anyone knows ?
[23:42:27] <WickedSik> @simulation: Do you have a scenario for that?
[23:44:29] <simulation> WickedSik: idk really :S but i must do that :S i have 2 select menu, one of them is "beginning city selection" the other is "ending city selection" and if user wants the "ending city selection" same with "beginning city selection" they will click a link and copy it ?
[23:44:36] <simulation> WickedSik: but how ?
[23:44:39] <simulation> WickedSik: :)
[23:47:24] <simulation> WickedSik: any idea ?
[23:48:07] <orl> Hi!
[23:48:24] <simulation> orl: Hi!
[23:49:18] <WickedSik>  simulation: so let me get this straight, you have a select-element which contains the start of a selection-array, and an element which contains the end of the selection-array?
[23:49:50] <WickedSik> simulation: why not use a <select multiple> ?
[23:51:01] <simulation> WickedSik: the select menu means same values with diff meanings :S so i cant use multiplie selection :S
[23:51:59] <WickedSik> simulation: do you have some code to start on?
[23:52:01] <simulation> WickedSik: for example both select menus have Paris, Londra,Berlin but one of the select menu means begininng of the trip the second one is means ending of the trip ?
[23:53:18] <WickedSik> Ok, and you want to add the selected-item from the first menu to the second?
[23:53:52] <orl> I've got a problem using load and ready. Let me try to explain it: I've got a page on which links are using .load() to load the content of an article (http://pastebin.com/DzZ5SEPZ). In this article, some things has to be highlighted when mouseover, and there is a jQuery script for this (should think whether I can do another way). I'm using .live(), as the elements to be highlighted didn't exist when the script was loaded. It works for one
[23:54:37] <WickedSik> orl: doesn't sound like a problem... what's the problem in this?
[23:54:46] <simulation> WickedSik:  yeah i want to copy selection form first one to second one ? :S
[23:55:20] <orl> WideSick : the problem is that one of the scripts highlighting things works, but both the others don't, even if I wrote them the same way.
[23:55:41] <orl> WideSick: this one works http://pastebin.com/hyddbKEW
[23:55:49] <simulation> WickedSik: i have solved it
[23:55:52] <WickedSik> orl: it's WickedSik
[23:55:55] <orl> WickedSik:
[23:55:59] <WickedSik> simulation: tell me :D
[23:56:01] <simulation> WickedSik: :)) thanks even
[23:56:03] <orl> yeah, just was it (and forgot to use tab!)
[23:56:19] <orl> WickedSik: http://pastebin.com/TrU2fGNR this one doesn't work
[23:56:27] <simulation> i just use this ="var beginingVal = $("#cyot-beginningregion > :selected").val(); 		$("#cyot-endingregion").val(beginingVal);"
[23:56:33] <orl> s/was/saw (morning, here)
[23:57:08] <WickedSik> simulation: it works for the same menu's, but it won't work if the element doesn't exist in the menu
[23:57:36] <WickedSik> simulation: I thought that was the case, but you just want to set the value of the second-menu to the selection of the first-menu
[23:58:21] <simulation> WickedSik: but the select menu values r same, this is for only making form usr friendly, if u need target location same u dont need to select it u just click "my target is same with beginning" :)
[23:58:25] <simulation> WickedSik: isnt it ?
[23:58:49] <WickedSik> simulation: I think so yes
[23:59:03] <WickedSik> orl: what version of jQuery are you using?
[23:59:13] <simulation> w
[23:59:21] <simulation> WickedSik: thanks :)=
[23:59:50] <WickedSik> orl: $().live() doesn't work on the mouseenter event
