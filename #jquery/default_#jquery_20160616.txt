[01:06:37] <abbot> I have a semantic-ui question
[01:06:41] <abbot> can I ask here?
[02:05:02] <muley> jqueryius: https://jsfiddle.net/hhyhh8z8/4/
[03:45:48] <viewty> Hi all. Why does https://jsfiddle.net/7nm0h301/ give error serverDate.split is not a function please?
[03:46:22] <Cork> viewty: cause serverDate is an array
[03:46:41] <Cork> you want serverDate[1].split(":")
[03:46:44] <viewty> oh bugger. me being stupid :o
[03:47:05] <viewty> heh... I use serverDate[0] later... forgot it when sorting out the time -.-
[03:47:15] <viewty> Thanks ^
[03:47:21] <Cork> viewty: also i would recommend looking at moment.js
[03:47:29] <Cork> it provides ways to parse dates
[03:48:30] <Cork> viewty: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/
[03:48:43] <viewty> Cool thanks
[03:54:04] <jqueryius> muley: thanks
[03:54:17] <jqueryius> I was also able to use prevAll() and nextAll()
[03:54:20] <jqueryius> same result
[03:54:24] <jqueryius> thank you
[05:41:59] <nicolas_FR> hi there ! I would like to push jquery validate errors messages in an already existing element (I have to calculate which one depending on the input), but I don't see how to achieve this
[05:42:29] <nicolas_FR> errorPlacement is not working, and I don't want to create a new element, I want to replace already existing text by the error message
[05:43:43] <nicolas_FR> (we're using opentip-jquery to display tooltips, and we want to replace their "normal" message with the error message if validation is false
[06:41:54] <anix> hi everyone. for a web app we have developed a UI based on Bootstrap 3 and jQuery, with a growing collection of maybe 12 plugins now for modal dialogs, buttons, input, autocomplete, plus some mustache.js for template rendering (server + client side), and some other JS tools. there is only a very small script that ties everything together, so nothing really big
[06:42:43] <anix> i like how this approach works perfect with deep links (including that modals are opened automatically for specific URLs) and search engine optimization
[06:43:40] <anix> however, i would like to add some features to dynamically update the UI at certain events and load more content via JSON/AJAX calls instead of complete pages
[06:45:19] <anix> basically, some parts should be a little more like a single page app. however, when looking around, i see plenty of JS frameworks, but i didn't find any that can pick up state from a server-side served document and progress to a SAP-style UI from there
[06:49:28] <anix> would also be cool to not throw away all the jQuery plugins and the UI that is familiar to the users
[06:53:41] <anix> i would think that there are also other jQuery users that mix there plugins with frameworks or libraries to achieve a UI that behaves like conventional (server-side produced) apps, but after initialisation behave more like a single page app, with-out doing everything twice
[06:57:58] <anix> for example, the To Do demo app from ToDoMVC.com all start with an empty to-do list. in contrast to that, i want that the server generates the HTML markup with already existing items and after page load the JS part will treat the list the same as if it was a result of user interactions or created programmatically
[07:02:53] <anix> has anyone tried this based on jQuery? are there frameworks or libraries that support such things?
[07:55:34] <donguston> hello
[09:12:09] <Eylith> Hi !
[09:12:23] <xec> Hi Eylith!
[09:12:37] <Eylith> I'm doing a small thing to search strings in a given txt
[09:12:49] <Eylith> and hightlight the text found
[09:13:03] <Eylith> but I have trouble wraping the exact text, and not the entiere element
[09:13:20] <Eylith> I'm quite new to web too, any idea on how to do this ?
[09:13:29] <decx> it's not trivial
[09:13:33] <Cork> Eylith: you have to add multiple instances for each element
[09:13:35] <xec> hmm, you'd have to generate new html
[09:13:38] <decx> best use an existing solution
[09:13:41] <Cork> as you can't span multiple elements
[09:13:50] <decx> example i did years ago: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/suegot4r/
[09:14:19] <Eylith> ooow, really :'
[09:14:21] <Eylith> :'(
[09:14:24] <taplar> yeah i was thinking you couldn't do it with 'plain text'
[09:14:27] <Eylith> decx: this is it decx
[09:14:51] <Eylith> that's too bad, my code works well ,just it highlight the entiere element
[09:15:13] <Cork> an optional solution is to absolute position the marking on an element you put behind
[09:15:26] <Cork> but if you have scrollable areas it becomes a real pain
[09:15:29] <taplar> lol, interesting
[09:15:46] <Cork> it is how browsers do it for search
[09:16:20] <Cork> actually it doens't have to go behind as we have pointer-events now days
[09:16:29] <Eylith> Cork: sorry I don't understand
[09:16:43] <Cork> Eylith: you could put a fixed element atop of the entire page
[09:17:01] <Cork> and then put highlighting in it and have the text marking that way
[09:17:18] <xec> how do you find the position of the text though
[09:17:18] <Cork> but if any elements move relative (scroll) it will break
[09:17:45] <Cork> ya, it is doable but messy
[09:19:24] <Cork> basically you select the text and grab the clientRects from that
[09:19:41] <Cork> you will have to handle fragments though so that becomes fun
[09:20:06] <Eylith> h, I might now be advanced enought apparently x)
[09:20:15] <Eylith> thanks though, I'll try some string black magic too
[09:20:20] <Eylith> see what I can get
[09:20:36] <Eylith> I might not*
[09:21:00] <taplar> black magic.  another soul lost to the dark side
[09:21:16] <Eylith> come on
[09:21:17] <notchris> lol
[09:21:21] <Eylith> web was black magic anyway
[09:21:38] <notchris> the only thing magic about the web is that we still use it
[09:21:43] <taplar> your saying charlotte was a sith lord?!
[09:21:57] <notchris> or away messages vs statuses
[09:21:59] <AwkwardCough> it fits the cannon
[09:22:00] <decx> i never actually used the thing i did, but if you dont search the bible or some long ass paragraph it'll probably work out
[09:22:08] <decx> ^ Eylith
[09:22:28] <Eylith> you mean performance issue  ?
[09:22:29] <xec> for strings (like he asked) this should be really more than good enough
[09:22:39] <decx> right
[09:22:53] <xec> it will break if you try any sort of semi complex html, but...
[09:23:13] <decx> yeah see i just cache the base html and when i highlight it'll be a plain base
[09:23:14] <Eylith> decx: nooo, it's just an internal search tools to search in 30Mo+ html report
[09:23:17] <Eylith> :''''(
[09:23:35] <xec> then good luck with that, dude :D
[09:23:37] <taplar> Mo?
[09:23:41] <Eylith> I'm sooo doomed
[09:23:43] <xec> months i guess
[09:24:33] <decx> i never used it because browser search is good enough btw
[09:24:40] <xec> Eylith: cant you just open the html in a browser and have them use CTRL+F
[09:24:40] <Eylith> taplar: that's what happen when C++ dev try to make web reports :D
[09:24:44] <xec> what decx said
[09:24:58] <Eylith> xec: no cause the browser does not search in hidden blockss
[09:25:19] <Eylith> my code don that's the main reason I'm doing it actually
[09:25:24] <Eylith> -don +do
[09:25:31] <taplar> can't highlight in hidden blocks either...
[09:25:36] <xec> ok you're making less sense
[09:25:54] <xec> like taplar says, you cant highlight hidden stuff...?
[09:25:55] <Eylith> sry for my broken eng
[09:26:15] <Eylith> since the search is done on a html taht we generate, I know exactly how it's done
[09:26:28] <Eylith> and I know what to do to make those blocks visible
[09:26:30] <xec> how what is done?
[09:26:43] <Eylith> the report
[09:29:24] <taplar> i'd try decx's suggestion then
[09:30:07] <taplar> and throttle your search
[09:30:16] <taplar> or debounce, which ever
[09:35:47] <notchris> taplar: Do you remember that localStorage thing I was doing yesterday?
[09:36:05] <taplar> vaguely
[09:36:29] <notchris> taplar: Well I was trying to duplicate an object, which worked out well
[09:36:39] <notchris> taplar: I want to save the data to a file, should I use json?
[09:36:53] <taplar> probably the easiest method
[09:37:10] <notchris> can i write to a json file with jquery though?
[09:37:11] <taplar> save to a file?
[09:37:32] <taplar> js in the browser, afaik, cannot write to the machine
[09:37:44] <notchris> right
[09:38:09] <MikeD_> is local storage sufficient persistence to "save" whatever you're putting in there?
[09:38:11] <Cork> taplar: that isn't correct
[09:38:17] <Cork> you can save to a file
[09:38:22] <taplar> huh
[09:38:25] <Cork> what you need to do is generate a Blob
[09:38:39] <Cork> then you use URL.createBlobURL()
[09:38:52] <Cork> and that url can be used to trigger a download save dialog
[09:39:05] <taplar> ah, so you can, but it required user interaction
[09:39:09] <Cork> yes
[09:39:21] <Cork> createObjectURL btw not Blob
[09:39:54] <Cork> also if you plan to stor larger quantities of data you should avoid local storage
[09:40:12] <Cork> it is VERY inefficient as it requires the browser to keep all the data in memory
[09:40:22] <Cork> a better option is indexedDB
[09:41:30] <Cork> (btw the keeping in memory is true even if you go to a page on the domain that doesn't use localStorage at all)
[09:41:58] <taplar> or store some identifier(s) in localstorage to use to get the stored info from the server
[09:42:20] <Cork> that is an option
[09:42:37] <decx> so basicly https://jsfiddle.net/hc3s2p9k/1/
[09:43:09] <Cork> decx: exactly :)
[09:45:25] <Cork> there is work ongoing for requestFileSystem()
[09:45:33] <Cork> but it isn't in browsers yet
[10:35:02] <Ales> is this kind of structure being used in jquery practices? http://pastebin.com/3N9WBp0n
[11:02:08] <soee> hi, any  suggestion how can i horizontal list have centered inside container on active item ?
[11:26:55] <decx> soee:  offset of element to its parent becomes negative offset of the parent
[11:49:41] <z1haze_work> I want to have a promotion show on my website for users once a day that is slidedown on page load but after 5 seconds it slides up. After the first time they view the site, it will load hidden.. how can I do that so every 24 hours it will 'reset'
[11:56:26] <decx> cookies
[11:58:35] <babycodeur> Hey all ! After a $.post i update the data attribute $('.icon-heart').attr('data-countnotif', countfavoris - 1) but when i try to retrieve the new data i got the old value console.log($('.icon-heart').data('countnotif'));
[11:59:19] <taplar> use data() to set it
[12:00:16] <babycodeur> @taplar, thx. Can you explain why this working ?
[12:54:02] <taplar> data() caches the value, attr() does not
[12:54:06] <taplar> iirc
[12:54:18] <taplar> so choose one or the other, :)
[12:59:01] <tocka> Hi guys, could someone please explain to me how is this website http://www.eginstill.com/ achieving the effect: when you scroll down the images appear to the left side like 50-70px.. I cant figure out hows its done :|
[12:59:43] <printForever> been looking at this page http://the-hundert.pr.co/presskit but I can't find out what Lightbox they are using... I've went through all the JS files loaded on the page and I can't find it
[13:04:18] <tocka> printForever
[13:04:21] <tocka> I think its custom made
[13:04:25] <printForever> tocka, mee too
[13:04:42] <printForever> because they aren't using any libraries that I can see.
[13:04:55] <tocka> One that I can see that they are using in the slider is http://mediaelementjs.com/
[13:05:39] <printForever> right
[13:06:19] <tocka> so yeah..
[13:06:24] <tocka> printForever can you help me with my issue? :D
[13:10:25] <printForever> what is it?
[13:45:14] <z1haze_work> can you assign cookie values of true/false or does it have to be a string?
[13:47:01] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie
[13:49:20] <Uhkis> empty evaluates to false and non-empty to true
[13:49:46] <z1haze_work> ah i see, well cool
[13:52:58] <pleasemybigga> Hey, guys. I'm trying to GET a page with jquery to refresh captcha
[13:53:16] <pleasemybigga> but in Firefox it literally goes there instead of happening in background
[13:58:21] <pleasemybigga> Hey, guys. I'm trying to GET a page with jquery to refresh captcha [20:53] <pleasemybigga> but in Firefox it literally goes there instead of happening in background
[13:58:37] <pleasemybigga> Come on, I'm sure one of you can help mayne,,
[14:00:32] <taplar> show us your logic if you would
[14:01:54] <Uhkis> pleasemybigga: you might wanna ask a question
[14:01:55] <pleasemybigga> @taplar http://pastebin.com/Ei2G0PRw
[14:02:12] <pleasemybigga> the question is how do I fix it so that Firefox also works in the same way it shold
[14:02:21] <pleasemybigga> Currently in Chrome everything happens in background
[14:02:42] <pleasemybigga> but in Firefox the ajax for captcha makes Firefox browser actually go to the URL
[14:03:42] <Uhkis> data.length is less than 5 on firefox
[14:04:58] <Uhkis> i blame that url
[14:05:57] <taplar> what url are you saying it goes to?  the endpoint your hitting with the ajax?  or are you saying it's doing the reload?
[14:08:57] <taplar> btw, you can use Date.now() to get the milliseconds instead of two stepping it
[14:09:10] <taplar> and $(...).prop( 'disabled', true/false )
[14:09:57] <pleasemybigga> <taplar> what url are you saying it goes to?  the endpoint your hitting with the ajax?  or are you saying it's doing the reload?
[14:10:12] <taplar> o_O  i'm aware of what i typed dude
[14:10:14] <pleasemybigga> 'taplar the only problem is that it goes to ?captcha=xxxxxxxxx in firefox
[14:10:47] <taplar> your saying it actually makes the page change to that url, not that it's making that ajax call?
[14:10:53] <pleasemybigga> Yes
[14:12:14] <taplar> when does 'buyingButton' get called and what is it's relation to the '#capcha' variable?
[14:50:41] <notchris> How to select a range
[14:50:42] <notchris> $('li.fields:gt(9):lt(11)')
[14:52:28] <taplar> $('li.fields').slice(9, 11)
[14:53:14] <taplar> may have to alter those numbers
[14:54:25] <notchris> yep!
[14:54:26] <notchris> :D
[14:54:27] <notchris> ty
[15:10:11] <thoraxe> ok, more dumb jquery (Really javascript) questions
[15:10:23] <thoraxe> actually nvm, lemme TIAS first
[15:11:14] <ploop> when I use $.each to append the value of every element of an array, and those values contain unicode escapes like \u65e5, literally those 5 characters get inserted to the document instead of the single character that those characters represent
[15:11:19] <ploop> is there a way to fix that?
[15:13:21] <ploop> (when I say "append" I mean $.append, as in I'm writing every element of the array into a place in the document, I'm not mutating the array in any way)
[15:23:39] <thoraxe> so, i have an .ajax call that has an .always on it
[15:24:09] <thoraxe> it appears that when you get a 500 at the remote side, your "result" object is different than when you get a 200...
[15:24:39] <thoraxe> https://jsfiddle.net/n9cwyr0a/
[15:24:57] <thoraxe> in this case, when the endpoint returns a 500, "result" contains a completely different object
[15:25:19] <thoraxe> actually there's a better way to do this.
[15:58:46] <pleasemybigga> hey uh
[15:58:49] <pleasemybigga> @taplar are you still there
[16:02:11] <notchris> lol
[16:06:53] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me and tell me why it won't bring in my data attributes on each button click? https://jsfiddle.net/s3yarb5L/
[16:07:10] <_TWG_> I get undefined on my local machine when I watch the console.
[16:12:20] <_TWG_> I guess everyone is gone now
[16:27:18] <kevireilly> _TWG_: #deleteRow doesn't exist which is possibly a start
[16:33:42] <_TWG_> kevireilly: here is an updated link https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/s3yarb5L/1/#&togetherjs=VEcAMdr05w
[16:34:58] <_TWG_> https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/s3yarb5L/2/ kevireilly
[16:35:02] <_TWG_> Sorry about that.
[16:36:13] <kevireilly> _TWG_: e.relatedTarget doesn't exist, perhaps you intend e.target or e.currentTarget?
[16:37:44] <_TWG_> They produce the same issue.
[16:38:18] <_TWG_> I'm trying to load my two data attributes into my modal when the hyperlink is clicked.  I'm not even sure that I should be using e.target, etc.
[16:39:26] <kevireilly> _TWG_: presumably you need to locate the correct target element first before being able to fetch data off of it
[16:40:03] <kevireilly> I actually don't really understand the .on({ 'show.uk.modal': fuction(e){ ... }}) approach
[16:40:07] <_TWG_> When i used e.relatedTarget, I assumed that it was doing it.
[16:40:45] <kevireilly> _TWG_: especially when unexpected things are happening, evaluate specifics like the event. Set a breakpoint or log the event or anything else where specifics are required
[16:41:13] <_TWG_> I'm loggin the e right after I open the function.  Going through it now.
[16:41:42] <kevireilly> at least in chrome, e.relatedTarget is undefined
[16:42:20] <_TWG_> It was for me too
[16:42:46] <kevireilly> so that is the second problem: make sure you're passing jQuery the proper reference for the element in question
[16:43:01] <kevireilly> or the proper selector or what have you
[16:47:51] <z1haze_work> anyone use packery? I am having trouble with what i think is a z-index issue: http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/XKKxRv when clicking on a grid item, it should slide down a content div, and then readjust,but the slide down is being hidden behind the lower item, I either want it on top or the shift to happen simultaneously
[17:00:05] <taplar> _TWG_: https://jsfiddle.net/s3yarb5L/3/
[17:02:34] <_TWG_> taplar, the name isn't showing in the modal text like it should.
[17:02:46] <taplar> you can fix that, :P
[17:04:12] <_TWG_> taplar thanks for that.  I changed it to text and it worked just fine.
[17:04:21] <_TWG_> I really do appreciate the help.
[17:07:41] <VeryBewitching> I'm having an issue with an on click event handler in IE 10 using jQuery.  This is the result of JSON.stringify($(this)) inside the event: {"0":{"jQuery220090039931215484461":{"events":{"click":[{"type":"click","origType":"click","guid":27,"namespace":""}]}}},"context":{"jQuery220090039931215484461":{"events":{"click":[{"type":"click","origType":"click","guid":27,"namespace":""}]}}},"length":1}
[17:07:58] <taplar> don't stringify a jQuery object
[17:08:00] <VeryBewitching> I'm trying to get a reference to the element the event fired from
[17:08:07] <VeryBewitching> taplar: It was to inspect it
[17:08:16] <VeryBewitching> IE 10s console is terrible
[17:08:56] <taplar> 'this' would be the element the event fired from
[17:09:13] <VeryBewitching> Lemme look at that one
[17:09:45] <taplar> actually that depends on if the event bubbled, so it depends
[17:12:52] <VeryBewitching> Ya, been messing with this for a while.  I have other on click events that work properly (on the same page); this one is behaving strangely.
[17:14:39] <VeryBewitching> So, in this Gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8b0e73abe2fdb26bebb976a7696fe27e the second event works, but the one above it reports null for the data attribute.
[17:15:57] <taplar> your probably running into issues with ->
[17:16:04] <taplar> -> doesn't change what 'this' is
[17:16:35] <taplar> try using ev.target
[17:16:40] <VeryBewitching> I have.
[17:16:47] <VeryBewitching> ev.target is a string
[17:16:49] <VeryBewitching> No kidding
[17:17:16] <VeryBewitching> And it's the URI on the A element this triggers from

[18:25:42] <theLearner> hello
[18:25:48] <theLearner> I just need some help
[18:26:10] <theLearner> this is the website: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BzzGde?editors=1010
[18:26:13] <theLearner> please help
[18:26:52] <theLearner> my problem is: if I drag out the object many times from the droppable it will deduct many times against the placeHolderOne variable
[18:27:27] <theLearner> I only want the drag even to deduct once even if I drag the draggable away from the droppable many times
[18:27:36] <theLearner> is my message clear?
[18:28:16] <theLearner> by dragging many times, I mean dragging or shaking the draggable back and forth from the droppable many times
[18:28:51] <theLearner> when this happens I only want the placeHolderOne variable to be deducted with the value of 1 only ONCE and not many times
[18:28:53] <theLearner> please help
[18:30:49] <theLearner> even if the draggle is remove already but when you keep of dragging the mouse cursor over the droppable the subtraction process still happens
[18:30:53] <theLearner> please help
[18:34:02] <Siphion> theLearner: i didn't get the problem :(
[18:34:20] <theLearner> Siphion: try dragging the draggable into the droppable
[18:34:40] <Siphion>  is the droppable the green one?
[18:34:50] <theLearner> then drag away the draggable out of the droppable and try doing it many times without releasing your mouse cursor
[18:34:55] <theLearner> yes the green one
[18:35:17] <Siphion> ok, and it logs "placeholder: 1"
[18:35:22] <theLearner> when you shake the mouse cursor in and out of the green box the subtraction process continues even if the draggable is removed
[18:35:27] <theLearner> yes
[18:36:13] <theLearner> when you drag out and shake the cursor in and out of the droppable (without releasing your mouse cursor) the subtraction process continues
[18:36:47] <theLearner> what I want is even if you do dragging in and out many times subtraction should ONLY HAPPEN ONLY once
[18:37:12] <theLearner> Siphion: help me :(
[18:38:51] <Siphion> what do you want to accomplish? do you want to subtract >only< when you release the click?
[18:39:27] <Siphion> ahhhh! i got the problem
[18:39:33] <theLearner> Siphion: what I want is subtract ONLY one time even if the mouse cursor is not yet release
[18:39:42] <Siphion> i can replicate the problem, gonna check
[18:40:10] <theLearner> because when the mouse is not release and you keep on dragging the mouse in and out without releasing the subtraction process still continues
[18:40:56] <theLearner> what I want is TO SUBTRACT ONLY ONCE when the object is drag out AND EVEN IF THE MOUSE IS DRAG IN AND OUT from the droppable
[18:41:07] <theLearner> Siphion: thanks man
[18:41:13] <theLearner> I have been spending two hours on this already
[18:41:44] <Siphion> just put: $(ui.draggable).removeClass("dragMe") when you subtract
[18:43:08] <Siphion> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wWWQmV?editors=1010 theLearner
[18:45:54] <theLearner> Siphion: $(ui.draggable).removeClass("dragMe")
[18:46:01] <theLearner> is this the only thing you did?
[18:46:05] <Siphion> yes
[18:46:08] <theLearner> add that line above
[18:46:10] <theLearner> wow
[18:46:11] <theLearner> man
[18:46:16] <theLearner> you are cool
[18:46:21] <theLearner> :)
[18:46:31] <Siphion> you just couldn't see it, no problem
[18:46:53] <theLearner> been using jquery for two years
[18:46:55] <Siphion> it's just like when you let something fall on the floor
[18:47:00] <theLearner> I still bump into this kind of situation
[18:47:21] <theLearner> any suggestions how I can improve better
[18:47:30] <Siphion> and on the floor there's a carpet with symbols and drawings
[18:49:42] <theLearner> Siphion: how long have you been using jquery
[18:50:08] <Siphion> eh, years
[18:50:20] <Siphion> 4-5 years
[18:50:55] <theLearner> Siphion: wow
[18:51:25] <theLearner> how do you overcome situations where you get bugs like that one I encounter just now
[18:51:39] <theLearner> do you always get to figure out the solutions all the time on your own
[18:58:31] <_MysT> Anyone around?
[19:03:29] <_MysT> Anyone feel like helping me troubleshoot why jQuery & Regex isn't working autoformat the phone number on my checkout page?
[19:07:02] <snover> _MysT: don’t ask to ask; https://rurounijones.github.io/blog/2009/03/17/how-to-ask-for-help-on-irc/
[19:36:12] <TML> I have been trying to get DOM's TreeWalker to walk the Attr nodes, but that's impossible as of DOM4. Is there something in jQuery that will allow me to visit every node in the document?
[19:42:32] <Siphion> probably jQuery('*') :/ TML
[19:42:51] <Siphion> but maybe you want to do a better query
[19:42:54] <TML> * only finds Nodes, and Attrs aren't nodes. :(
[19:43:31] <Siphion> What's the grammar of the attr you're looking for?
[19:43:50] <TML> I'm trying to walk the entire tree, visiting every single item
[19:44:40] <Siphion> Sorry i don't get it :(
[19:44:49] <Siphion> Can you make an example?
[19:45:43] <TML> https://jsfiddle.net/dxpmn85s/
[19:46:57] <TML> I want to touch every node, attr, comment, and entity
[19:47:58] <TML> and CDATA section
[19:56:21] <SlizardWizard> I this button which adds an extra 5 fields to a form, and <button> which is supposed to delete these extra inputs. I am using append() to create the inputs. I am then trying to bind the action of delete to the button but for some reason i can't find it
[19:57:15] <SlizardWizard> Here is the code https://gist.github.com/SlizardWizard/2123f2eb04051c458d33f49fbd525e8b
[19:57:42] <SlizardWizard> I am not really happy with it at all, so tell me all issues and ways to make it better
[19:59:33] <TML> Siphion: e.g., I'm looking for a javascript solution to https://3v4l.org/S0Z4v. I first tried to do it with straight JS, but the Attr issue. Then I tried jQuery, but find('*') doesn't match Attr's either. I don't understand why Attrs are being treated as second-class citizens.
[20:01:25] <snover> TML: they aren’t second-class citizens, but they are also not Nodes (any more). for each Element you will need to just look at its `attributes` property. Try `document.createTreeWalker` or `document.createNodeIterator`.
[20:02:21] <TML> snover: I'm using document.createTreeWalker; it doesn't visit Attr
[20:03:09] <TML> Tried both NodeFilter.SHOW_ALL and NodeFilter.SHOW_ALL|NodeFilter.SHOW_ATTRIBUTE (just in case "all" just didn't mean "all" anymore)
[20:03:30] <snover> because they are not nodes
[20:03:46] <TML> snover: Making them "not Nodes", AFAICT, has had the effect of making them second-class citizens.
[20:03:54] <snover> like i said, literally all you have to do is, if the node is an element, iterate its `attributes` property
[20:04:09] <snover> they aren’t part of a dom tree either, they are associated with elements. you can’t have an attr without an element.
[20:05:05] <TML> You can't have an element without a document - does that mean Element will be removed too, and I'll need a special kind of logic to iterate elements?
[20:05:50] <snover> i don’t understand the arguing that is going on here…
[20:06:36] <TML> It's not argument. I'm trying to understand what the correct way is to iterate a DOM document with a single kind of loop.
[20:07:02] <TML> Having 6 different kinds of loop is a non-starter
[20:08:36] <TML> it just doesn't seem realistic that the WHATWG gave us no way to walk the entire document as of DOM4
[20:11:34] <snover> function doSomething(n) { if (n.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) { for (var i = 0; i < n.attributes.length; ++i) { doSomething(n.attributes[i]); } …do things… } var walker = document.createTreeWalker(…); while (walker.nextNode()) doSomething(walker.currentNode);
[20:12:25] <snover> i’m really curious about what it is you want to do to everything including Attrs
[20:13:02] <TML> one set of logic for Attr, one for CDATASection, one for Entity, one for EntityReference, one for Notation, and one for everything else?
[20:13:48] <snover> i’m curious what web platform you have been working on that is not full of insane decisions too, that would make you think that walking a dom would not also be insane :)
[20:14:36] <TML> snover: I will be handed a document about which I can assume absolutely nothing; I must walk this document in an automated fashion and filter, select, or replace certain items.
[20:16:18] <snover> you’ll never see Entity or EntityReference since those aren’t things any more
[20:16:47] <TML> I can't assume that. Some of the documents might be from 1999.
[20:16:51] <snover> same thing with CDATASection
[20:17:09] <TML> Or from someone who read the spec and decided to exercise all the corner cases.
[20:17:59] <snover> it would be hard for that to be a thing since they were never even implemented in most browsers
[20:18:10] <TML> I'm not limited to browsers
[20:18:57] <TML> In fact, most of the documents I will be consuming are likely to be machine generated XML/XHTML that have never interacted with a web browser.
[20:19:58] <TML> But I cannot exclude the possibility that someone is trying to slip proprietary data past the filter by hiding it in some kind of object that is technically valid, but not widely supported.
[20:20:43] <TML> If the document isn't valid, it will be rejected before it ever gets to me. I'm only concerned with valid, but unusual edge-cases.
[20:21:23] <snover> well you are going to have an interestingly impossible time at whatever this abstract filtering task is i guess. you will never be able to use a browser dom to do it, that’s for sure.
[20:22:15] <TML> I'm not worried about the browser DOM
[20:22:53] <TML> *shrug* I guess I'll just implement it in PHP.
[20:23:09] <snover> ok. look out for the billion laughs!
[20:24:06] <TML> Just mind-boggling that JavaScript let this happen.
[20:24:30] <TML> Was hoping jQuery would have a sane alternative, as it so often does to the weird decisions in JavaScript.
[20:25:39] <snover> good luck!
[20:25:41] <TML> snover: Thanks for trying, anyway :)
[20:27:03] <TML> The PHP solution is already complete - was actually pretty much just the example I sent over earlier.
[20:27:49] <TML> snover: :) Much obliged. Sorry - I'm on a train, so the connection is spotty.
[20:27:59] <TML> have a good remainder of the day
[20:59:46] <SlizardWizard> I have this button which adds an extra 5 fields to a form, and <button> which is supposed to delete these extra inputs. I am using append() to create the inputs. I am then trying to bind the action of delete to the button but for some reason i can't find it
[20:59:51] <SlizardWizard> Here is the code https://gist.github.com/SlizardWizard/2123f2eb04051c458d33f49fbd525e8b
[20:59:57] <SlizardWizard> I am not really happy with it at all, so tell me all issues and ways to make it better
[21:30:16] <momsthewurd> I had to write some proxying php code to make cross domain requests -- for the most part everything works and I'm running the application locally. However one of the apis (not my code) errors in the body of its $.ajax call every single time--UNLESS I insert async:false, then it succeeds every time.
[21:30:45] <momsthewurd> I only found this out because stepping through the code with the debugger would always work but running normally always failed.
[21:31:28] <momsthewurd> This is totally new to me I have no idea how to debug this error. Obviously I can't just freeze the page.
[21:39:45] <limbera> i am building a pretty complicated form in jquery - with dynamically added sections of inputs, and within those sections further dynamically added <select> elements etc..
[21:40:04] <limbera> are there any good articles you know of that teach the best way to maintain that sort of structure with state etc..?
