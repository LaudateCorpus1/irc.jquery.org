[02:26:00] <smoke_> i have a ajax request with a json variable with "setpoint":[{"1":7.3000001907349},{"1":7.4000000953674},{"1":7.5},{"1":7.5999999046326},{"1":7.6999998092651},{"1":7.8000001907349}]} how do i get the setpoint data with the "1"? normally it was setpoint[0][1]
[02:40:35] <codechewing> smoke_ You want json.setpoint[0]
[02:40:58] <codechewing> if json is your variable name containing; {"setpoint":[{"1":7.3000001907349},{"1":7.4000000953674},{"1":7.5},{"1":7.5999999046326},{"1":7.6999998092651},{"1":7.8000001907349}]};
[02:41:52] <smoke_> codechewing, well, i have an ajax call and in my success function im using data["schedule"][0] that works fine, but data["setpoint"][0]["1"] isnt working
[02:45:19] <codechewing> are you sure the property key "1" exists on the returned json?
[02:46:33] <smoke_> let me see what i get with stringify
[02:47:25] <smoke_> oh wow
[02:47:30] <smoke_> ok i found out what was going on
[02:47:34] <smoke_> thank you codechewing
[02:48:05] <codechewing> welcome :)
[03:48:43] <rindolf> Hi all.
[04:20:52] <iDevelop> rindolf:
[04:20:57] <iDevelop> You there?
[04:24:38] <rindolf> iDevelop: hi.
[04:24:43] <rindolf> iDevelop: yes, I am.
[04:24:59] <iDevelop> rindolf: I'm designing an email template right now
[04:25:04] <iDevelop> I could use some feedback
[04:25:13] <rindolf> iDevelop: OK.
[04:25:27] <iDevelop> Mind popping over to see it a sec? I can show you and get feedback
[04:25:34] <rindolf> iDevelop: where?
[04:25:42] <iDevelop> I'll query it to you
[04:25:45] <rindolf> iDevelop: OK.
[04:25:48] <rindolf> iDevelop: don't flood.
[04:37:31] <smoke_> is there a way to include a javascript file inside a ajax success event?
[04:38:04] <dipika> c
[04:38:13] <dipika> ccff
[04:38:21] <dipika> hello
[04:45:29] <rindolf> smoke_: hi.
[04:45:40] <smoke_> hi
[04:45:41] <rindolf> smoke_: you can include JS code in the AJAX response.
[04:45:57] <smoke_> do i need a custom function?
[04:45:57] <rindolf> smoke_: and eval it or whatever (but it can be dangerous).
[04:46:04] <rindolf> smoke_: a custom function?
[04:46:08] <smoke_> just eval?
[04:46:13] <rindolf> smoke_: do you control the AJAX service?
[04:46:17] <smoke_> eval()?
[04:46:22] <smoke_> yes
[04:46:28] <rindolf> smoke_: JS has an eval.
[04:46:40] <rindolf> smoke_: I don't know exactly how to use it.
[04:46:45] <smoke_> ya i know about it, just eval the new javascript in the ajax success event?
[04:46:52] <smoke_> k ill look into it
[04:46:55] <smoke_> thanks
[04:47:01] <rindolf> smoke_: then you can have it send JSON where one of the values contains some JS code.
[04:47:07] <rindolf> smoke_: you're welcome .
[05:37:55] <juboba_> why does $('<body asd="jkl">jkgh</body>').attr('asd'); return undefined?
[05:39:06] <rindolf> juboba_: doesn't the <body /> tag already exist?
[05:39:16] <juboba_> ?
[05:40:03] <rindolf> juboba_: $('<a href="foo">Hello</a>').attr('href') - is working fine.
[05:40:56] <rindolf> juboba_: there's one global body element for the document - I'm not sure you can easily create a new one.
[05:41:38] <juboba_> uhm, I'm managing xmpp stanzas
[05:41:58] <juboba_> rindolf: yes, your example and any other tag works fine
[05:41:58] <rindolf> juboba_: what are those?
[05:42:14] <juboba_> i.e. chat messages
[05:42:24] <juboba_> xmpp is a protocol for communication
[05:42:24] <rindolf> juboba_: ah.
[05:42:30] <rindolf> juboba_: I know what XMPP is.
[05:42:33] <juboba_> ok
[05:42:43] <rindolf> juboba_: but what does it have to do with jQuery?
[05:42:44] <juboba_> dang
[05:42:47] <juboba_> hehe
[05:42:59] <juboba_> I can use jQuery for treating the responses from the server :P
[05:43:06] <juboba_> as they are XML
[05:43:48] <rindolf> juboba_: is it an HTTP-based protocol?
[05:44:58] <Mottie> juboba_: see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2 ... When passing in complex HTML, some browsers may not generate a DOM that exactly replicates the HTML source provided. As mentioned, jQuery uses the browser"s .innerHTML property to parse the passed HTML and insert it into the current document. During this process, some browsers filter out certain elements such as <html>, <title>, or <head> elements. As a result, the elements inserted may not be repres
[05:46:39] <sonotos> juboba_: use http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsexml/
[05:49:31] <juboba_> rindolf: I'm using BOSH wich translates HTTP requests to XMPP
[05:50:03] <juboba_> thanks sonotos
[05:50:07] <juboba_> and all
[05:50:47] <rindolf> juboba_: you're welcome .
[05:50:56] <sonotos> are you building an own xmmp lib or are you using an existing one?
[05:51:25] <juboba_> I'm using Strophe
[05:52:01] <sonotos> intresting, thx
[06:35:48] <juboba_> sonotos: do you have any idea of what to do if '\' characters are included in the message?
[06:36:08] <juboba_> parseXML fails if there are '\' characters are included in the message
[06:36:24] <juboba_> I need this because messages may contain LaTeX code
[06:37:06] <prtksxna> juboba_: Is it escaped? \\
[06:37:16] <juboba_> no
[06:37:35] <juboba_> I wouldn't know when to escape it
[06:37:47] <juboba_> when the message arrives I should
[06:37:55] <juboba_> before parsing it
[06:39:30] <rindolf> juboba_: does it happen even if the XML is valid?
[06:39:46] <juboba_> no, if the XML is valid, then everything shines
[06:39:58] <rindolf> juboba_: ah.
[06:40:07] <rindolf> juboba_: well, valid XML can contain backslashes.
[06:40:42] <juboba_> <mytag>\(hello\)</mytag> is invalid
[06:40:55] <juboba_> according to jQuery
[06:40:57] <juboba_> not to XML
[06:42:01] <juboba_> xml validators say it's fine
[06:42:50] <juboba_> but $.parseXML("<mytag>\( \vec{E} \)</mytag>"); say it's invalid
[06:43:20] <juboba_> it processes it as ( ec{E} )
[06:43:44] <juboba_> it's interpreting \(
[06:44:03] <juboba_> even replacing " with '
[06:44:28] <rindolf> juboba_: that's due to JS' quoting/escaping.
[06:44:49] <rindolf> juboba_: it translates \v into a vertical tab.
[06:44:55] <juboba_> yes
[06:45:05] <juboba_> but what should I do?
[06:45:11] <juboba_> the messages are going to come this way
[06:45:23] <rindolf> juboba_: you need to escape the \ inside the string.
[06:45:25] <juboba_> I can't manage how the message gets sent because multiple clients can be used
[06:45:38] <rindolf>  $.parseXML("<mytag>\\( \\vec{E} \\)</mytag>");
[06:45:51] <juboba_> rindolf: by replacing s/\/\\/?
[06:45:57] <rindolf> juboba_: yes.
[06:46:00] <juboba_> ok
[06:46:10] <rindolf> juboba_: it shouldn't matter for user input.
[06:47:05] <juboba_> msg_obj.replace('\\', '\\\\');?
[06:47:23] <juboba_> that should work
[07:22:34] <rindolf> juboba_: hi.
[07:22:40] <rindolf> juboba_: why do you have to do that?
[07:22:51] <rindolf> juboba_: note that .replace does not work in place.
[07:48:33] <StephenS> Cork here?
[07:55:32] <jkymmel> https://github.com/jkymmel/Projer/blob/master/js/loadmore.js line 35
[07:55:46] <jkymmel> it should duplicate the html element, right?
[07:58:57] <rindolf> jkymmel: I think so, but I'm not an expert.
[07:59:36] <jkymmel> that's what it should do, I think, but it seems to do nothing...
[08:00:10] <hrrz> hi, i'm using arbor js to draw graph. I have 2 questions 1. how can i style the nodes themselves? 2. is there a way to use force graph but one node to remain static?
[08:31:42] <ozoness> Hi guys. I'm triggering some custom events. Should I catch them using bind() or on()?
[08:33:04] <Clorith> on
[08:33:43] <Clorith> bind has been deprecated since 1.7
[08:37:00] <skypce> hello guys
[08:38:33] <rindolf> skypce: hi.
[08:38:58] <ozoness> Clorith: ah nice thanks. And do you have idea how can I target from on the element where I triggered the event? E.g: $('.variation:first').trigger('customEvent'); $('.variation').on('customEvent', function(){ console.log($(this)); });
[08:39:23] <ozoness> Id'd like that last $(this) to be '.variation:first'
[08:39:54] <skypce> hello rindolf
[08:39:59] <skypce> i need some of help
[08:40:03] <skypce> i have this : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ozDgJ
[08:41:01] <skypce> i have this : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ozDgJ i have many .item.clearfix .imgBg items , i want move the .imgBg for each .active and put it in #testimonal-wrapper. please any help will be welcome
[08:41:35] <rindolf> skypce: can't you use $( ... ).forEach( ... )?
[08:43:05] <Clorith> ozoness: You're about ot make the same mistake I did when I went into the world of .on :P
[08:43:31] <Clorith> You could target it better if you do $(parent).on('event', 'target element', function() );
[08:43:43] <StephenS> Shouldn't this function be called each type I write a char in a input box, actually it is, but attachwaiter is called only the 1st time, http://pastebin.com/U0jfBRMp
[08:43:56] <StephenS> each time*
[08:44:11] <rindolf> skypce: do you want to put the HTML markup of the item there instead?
[08:44:25] <StephenS> but when I keep typing i don't get waiting.. why?
[08:45:41] <bakflash> hello, well it's likely you'll have a big facepalm with this question,but can't figure out whats my proplem :/ ... I've loaded jquery in my header, and later in the head I have a <script> block trying to use a jquery function    if ($(window).width() < 960) {         but it throws an undefined exception .. why is the script block not knowing the imported jquery? :/
[08:45:43] <skypce> rindolf, yes i want that when active the class item.clearfix (item.clearfix.active) the .imgBg will be moved to #testimonial-wrapper
[08:45:59] <rindolf> StephenS: you have too much logic inside the on... handlers.
[08:46:31] <rindolf> skypce: see http://www.elated.com/articles/jquery-removing-replacing-moving-elements/
[08:46:32] <StephenS> ?
[08:46:34] <StephenS> I don't, it's trivial
[08:47:07] <StephenS> rindolf can you check it and fix it?
[08:47:14] <rindolf> StephenS: no, I cannot.
[08:47:28] <StephenS> It works for the first letter, but once livesearch popped up, it does not show waiting anymore.
[08:47:29] <rindolf> StephenS: some people recommend attaching .on handlers.
[08:48:38] <StephenS> whats event?
[08:48:43] <StephenS> on( "keydown",...?
[08:49:20] <skypce> thank you rindofl
[08:49:22] <skypce> thank you rindolf
[08:49:34] <rindolf> skypce: you're welcome .
[08:49:47] <rindolf> StephenS: don't know offhand.
[08:55:23] <StephenS> ..
[09:05:14] <StephenS> or at least tell me how to do it onblur="" I have a $("#livesearch").hide() when I blur out of inputbox, however, it blurs out asap, even when I hit a link on livesearch pop-up box rindolf, any idea how to check if link is pressed?
[09:05:49] <skypce> rindolf, i have this now : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ehqks
[09:06:13] <skypce> the problem is when the slider advance to next .active element the imgBg doesnt change
[09:09:17] <rindolf> StephenS: well, maybe declare a function and call that.
[09:10:40] <StephenS> ok rindolf $('a#livesearch').click(function() { //should stay #livesearch }else { $("#livesearch).hide() });
[09:10:46] <hrrz> hi, i'm using arbor js to draw graph. I have 2 questions 1. how can i style the nodes themselves? 2. is there a way to use force graph but one node to remain static?
[09:11:25] <StephenS> so if link is inside #livesearch box, box should stay, since it will disappear on a next redirect, and if is not inside #livesearch box or it's just blurred without pressing any link it should hide itself.
[09:11:49] <rindolf> StephenS: what?
[09:12:30] <StephenS> I want to close #livesearch box, if I click anywhere on a page, and I think the best solution is onblur?
[09:15:57] <rindolf> StephenS: don't know off hand.
[09:20:07] <davidsharer> Morning
[09:20:23] <davidsharer> Are the couchdb APIs extensible?
[09:20:40] <davidsharer> let's say I wanted to add a _users attribute to a POST/GET _session response
[09:20:43] <davidsharer> is that possible?
[09:22:47] <BillCriswell> davidsharer: Think you've wandered into the wrong channel.
[09:23:02] <davidsharer> BillCriswell: you are correct haha
[09:23:53] <BillCriswell> StephenS: What's your goal?
[09:24:17] <StephenS> to remove #livesearch div when I click outside of it anywhere on a page.
[09:24:32] <skypce> hey guys can help me with this, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ehqks
[09:24:41] <skypce> in codepen doesnt work
[09:24:44] <skypce> but in my localhost yes
[09:25:10] <skypce> the problem is that the image doesnt change when slideshow advance to next item
[09:25:14] <skypce> the imgBg
[09:25:18] <BillCriswell> StephenS: $(document).on('click', function () { if ($(e.target).closest('#livesearch').length === 0){ $('#livesearch').hide(); } });
[09:26:07] <BillCriswell> That's looking at the element that triggered a click anywhere on the document then checks if it's parent or self is #livesearch
[09:26:22] <BillCriswell> If it's ancestors, not just parent.
[09:27:18] <StephenS> ypeError: undefined is not a function
[09:27:57] <StephenS> BillCriswell ?
[09:31:53] <BillCriswell> StephenS: http://jsbin.com/dazup/1/
[09:33:05] <StephenS> yes I c/p your function and it does not work o.0
[09:33:21] <skypce> how can i update html when slideshow .active class go to next?
[09:33:41] <StephenS> blah I didnt used 2.10
[09:34:09] <StephenS> BillCriswell Thanks, works perfectly!
[09:34:20] <BillCriswell> StephenS: 2.10 wouldn't matter.
[09:34:29] <BillCriswell> I forgot the event in the code I gave you.
[09:34:37] <StephenS> it does, I use v1.6.1 :D
[09:34:44] <BillCriswell> function () { i .... should have been function (e) { i
[09:35:04] <StephenS> yes I edited that and still got an error, I updated jQuery and works fine.
[09:35:40] <BillCriswell> StephenS: That's not using anything that isn't available in 1.6 though.
[09:37:57] <BillCriswell> StephenS: Nevermind. I'm wrong.
[09:38:13] <StephenS> hmm I switched back to 1.6
[09:38:16] <StephenS> not working ;[
[09:38:29] <BillCriswell> StephenS: The 1.6 version fo that would need to do $(document).click(function(e){...}); instead of .on
[09:38:31] <StephenS> how to make it work in 1.6?
[09:38:44] <BillCriswell> BUT you should probably upgrade anyway haha
[09:39:07] <StephenS> Yes that works now
[09:39:28] <StephenS> but as you can see my html, when I focus again I get a #livesearch showed again, and your code just kills it
[09:39:42] <StephenS> this: onfocus="if (this.value.length >= 1) { showResult(this.value); }else {  $('#livesearch').hide(); }"
[09:40:32] <StephenS> name of input textbox is: name="search"
[09:40:39] <StephenS> maybe to exclude that somehow?
[09:42:07] <StephenS> BillCriswell ?
[09:43:02] <BillCriswell> StephenS: Your logic is throwing me pretty good here.
[09:43:08] <StephenS> :D
[09:43:20] <BillCriswell> So when the focus you want to do what?
[09:43:33] <StephenS> to show #livesearch
[09:43:33] <BillCriswell> ... or when they blur do you want to hide #livesearch if it's empty
[09:43:42] <StephenS> if you ever used fb, you would know :D
[09:43:57] <StephenS> it doesn't matter if they blur now
[09:43:59] <BillCriswell> I use facebook.
[09:44:03] <BillCriswell> Uh, ok.
[09:44:04] <StephenS> your code works fine and doing blur thing
[09:44:15] <StephenS> but it hides it when I focus on search inputbox
[09:44:47] <BillCriswell> Well if it's empty that's exactly what you're telling it to do.
[09:44:56] <StephenS> yes and that works
[09:45:13] <StephenS> but I had to keep pressing backspace to make it 0 chars
[09:45:55] <StephenS> now with your code I just click somewhere outside of livesearch and it hides which is fine, but text remains inside input field, so when I focus on inputbox, livesearch shows and hides all at the same time, which your code does hiding.
[09:46:11] <StephenS> I just want to exclude it on focus
[09:46:31] <StephenS> so on focus, livesearch remain showed
[09:46:59] <BillCriswell> It's like you're making this complicated on purpose.
[09:47:31] <BillCriswell> I have to run. Good luck, though!
[09:47:35] <StephenS> ;[
[09:51:11] <skypce> guys
[09:51:12] <skypce>  var $html = $(".item.clearfix.active").find(".imgBg");
[09:51:12] <skypce>     $("#testimonial-wrapper").html($html);
[09:51:14] <StephenS> yeah I solved it!
[09:51:47] <skypce> i have this two lines the problem is that not update when next .active is selected
[09:51:50] <rindolf> StephenS: that's great.
[09:52:04] <StephenS> it is!
[09:52:07] <rindolf> skypce: where's the code?
[09:52:22] <rindolf> skypce: did you try using a debugger?
[09:52:47] <rindolf> skypce: on the channel.
[10:11:49] <joshuaw> are there any jQM users here/
[10:11:50] <joshuaw> ?
[10:12:41] <joshuaw> I am trying, to figure out what is the best way to do a login page
[10:13:14] <joshuaw> should it be the first page? or should it be a second or third and some kind of redirect is used?
[10:13:53] <rindolf> joshuaw: jQuery Mobile?
[10:15:16] <joshuaw> rindolf: yes
[10:15:41] <joshuaw> it is easier to make the login the first page
[10:15:46] <joshuaw> but I think it shouldn't be first
[10:16:09] <joshuaw> in jQuery Mobile the first page is the main page
[10:16:23] <joshuaw> and I think that the main page of the app should be the first page
[10:16:31] <joshuaw> am I wrong for thinking this way
[10:18:47] <joshuaw> I would prefer to make it the last page in the list of HTML pages and programmatically force the user to log in and then once logged in when ever they go to the main URL they get the main page instead of having to see the log in again
[10:27:16] <Sergonium> you know anything about sessions (server side) joshuaw?
[10:27:39] <joshuaw> Sergonium: some
[10:30:03] <joshuaw> Sergonium: did you have a question or are sessions part of your explanation to my question?
[10:31:13] <Sergonium> well yea, you talk about html pages, you you literally mean static html pages?
[10:31:38] <joshuaw> have you tried jQM?
[10:31:56] <joshuaw> in 1 html file there can be a lot of 'pages'
[10:32:08] <joshuaw> they are changed with AJAX
[10:32:28] <joshuaw> the first 'page' listed in that 1 html file is the first thing that is shown
[10:32:37] <joshuaw> and you can then navigate to the other pages
[10:32:53] <joshuaw> so it doesn't fit with the old paradigm really
[10:33:47] <joshuaw> as for static, that 1 pages is partially static but there are some dynamic lists with in it
[10:34:50] <Sergonium> i am not into jQM but its handy to log in before even actually being able to request the logged in pages trough ajax or not
[10:35:31] <joshuaw> I don't follow?
[10:35:52] <joshuaw> I know that back in the day we would use a DMZ to log in
[10:36:06] <joshuaw> and then once authenticated you get access to the site
[10:36:24] <Sergonium> anyway, once the session with the log in exists you have to push in what ever kinda format your "first page" with the proper properties, like not showing a login screen for example
[10:37:30] <Sergonium> whatever format you do that in is up to you (plain html or even xml that is parsed by your scripts), but it still has to be generated server side in case sessions die or whatever
[10:38:19] <joshuaw> getting things secured and keeping it that is not really my issue
[10:38:37] <joshuaw> it is a very specific jQuery Mobile design question
[10:38:57] <joshuaw> should the login page be the first or top 'page' or not
[10:40:40] <joshuaw> there is always the option to separate the login page from the app page
[10:41:06] <Sergonium> after a quick look, you're talking about the multi page template structure right?
[10:41:07] <joshuaw> but the only examples I have seen have the login as the main page and that just doesn't feel right
[10:42:11] <joshuaw> by multi page template, do you mean all the pages in one html file or more then 1 html file?
[10:42:34] <Sergonium> multiple in one html
[10:42:44] <joshuaw> that is what I am talking about
[10:43:58] <Sergonium> anyway i would just put it in one of those multiple pages, whatever feels best, but just make sure these pages do not contain any info that should be only seen by logged in users. when logged in just generate a whole other multipage structure to start with (or mutate the current one trough ajax)
[10:44:34] <joshuaw> all the date gets generated after login
[10:44:42] <joshuaw> so that there is no worry there
[10:45:53] <joshuaw> once the user is authenticated the main page does a GET to retrieve the data and create a list of the returned info
[10:47:01] <Sergonium> you can easily remove whole login divs or whatever trough javascript if the login passed and load a bunch of new content in new page divs or w/e (and then if you totally reload and are still log in generate it server side properly like that too). there are many ways to do this
[10:47:43] <joshuaw> yeah, my problem is that there are lots of ways
[10:47:57] <joshuaw> I was curious if anyone else has done this
[10:48:12] <joshuaw> I can always do what all the simple examples do
[10:48:23] <joshuaw> make the login the main page
[10:49:09] <joshuaw> I guess I will just have to try several different things out
[10:49:23] <joshuaw> and see which feels best from the users perspective
[10:49:40] <joshuaw> this is really a UI related question
[10:53:00] <Sergonium> from a users perspective i would just want to see some information and maybe a button linking to the login part or preferably the login area itself in it too if its not too much interfering with the rest of the page content
[10:53:18] <Sergonium> as first page to see
[10:54:32] <joshuaw> thanks Sergonium, I should have thought of that
[10:54:42] <Sergonium> maybe a small user / password field on top
[10:54:51] <joshuaw> yup
[10:54:55] <joshuaw> like most sites
[10:55:04] <joshuaw> show something but not any data
[10:56:08] <joshuaw> I was just thinking of requiring the user to login before they saw anything
[10:57:43] <Sergonium> yea sorry if i might have talked too much of the technical side:P being half sleepy and after reading over your question another time the actual question got more clear:)
[10:57:54] <Sergonium> became*
[11:00:49] <joshuaw> no worries
[11:01:05] <joshuaw> I should have said it was a UI question not a security question
[11:45:55] <skypce> hey guys can help me with this pleaase?
[11:45:55] <skypce> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hKnmJ
[11:46:41] <skypce> when change .active element to next i want move .imgBg html to #testimonial-wrapper :)
[11:49:03] <jdo_dk> Any hints for showing nice info/error messages in jquerymobile?
[11:58:48] <joshuaw> jdo_dk: are you looking for a popup or validation?
[11:59:08] <jdo_dk> joshuaw: Just a sec. :D
[11:59:19] <joshuaw> then you will want http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[11:59:22] <joshuaw> it rocks
[12:00:10] <jdo_dk> joshuaw: Bootstrap has classes like this: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts
[12:00:18] <jdo_dk> I just want something similar in jquerymobile.
[12:00:56] <joshuaw> I haven't tried that
[12:01:25] <jdo_dk> Just "css-classes" like: info, error, warning, etc..
[12:01:26] <joshuaw> but if you want just form validation then what I gave you will appear similar to what you showed
[12:01:54] <joshuaw> well, if you can't find it, maybe write your own plugin ;)
[12:01:57] <jdo_dk> Joshuaw: I see. But i think i use jquery mobile the wrong way.
[12:02:15] <joshuaw> how are you using it?
[12:02:27] <joshuaw> to make desktop apps :D
[12:02:50] <jdo_dk> a form -> submit -> process data -> show page again with info about success / error.
[12:03:19] <joshuaw> that is similar to what I am doing
[12:04:24] <jdo_dk> thats why i need css to style error / success statuses.
[12:04:37] <joshuaw> hmm
[12:04:57] <joshuaw> well, I either return data (succues) or an error message
[12:05:14] <joshuaw> *success
[12:05:34] <jdo_dk> as a dialog ?
[12:05:39] <joshuaw> no
[12:05:58] <joshuaw> it displays it along with the form item that is in error
[12:06:10] <joshuaw> and different error messages depending what is wrong
[12:06:11] <jdo_dk> jquery validation does ?
[12:06:14] <joshuaw> yes
[12:06:19] <jdo_dk> I know.
[12:06:20] <joshuaw> it ROCKS
[12:06:36] <jdo_dk> I know, have been using it in a "pure" jquery app earlier.
[12:06:44] <jdo_dk> Just looked for another solution on this.
[12:06:48] <joshuaw> ah
[12:06:57] <joshuaw> I don't know everything out there
[12:07:06] <joshuaw> so there maybe something like that
[12:07:07] <jdo_dk> joshuaw: I will try to create a "simple" response for now.
[12:07:10] <jdo_dk> Thanks dude
[12:07:15] <joshuaw> sure
[12:07:21] <joshuaw> good luck
[12:20:08] <jdo_dk> joshuaw: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/docs-headers.html <-- look at the bottom. I can use the ui-bar. :D
[12:28:48] <joshuaw> jdo_dk: but that is a header or footer
[12:29:03] <jdo_dk> Works ok. :D
[12:29:11] <joshuaw> ok
[12:29:38] <joshuaw> what version of jQM are you on?
[12:29:49] <joshuaw> because that changed in 1.4
[12:30:18] <joshuaw> jdo_dk: ^^^
[12:30:33] <jdo_dk> 1.3.2
[12:30:59] <joshuaw> then consider it an FYI
[13:56:04] <astroo-> hello people
[13:57:58] <ozoness> Hi guys! I'm using this way to add methods to my plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1117086/how-to-create-a-jquery-plugin-with-methods It works great but the only problem is I can't chain after calling the plugin
[13:58:34] <ozoness> In my previous plugins I used return this; to be able to chain, but I'm not sure how to do it in this case...
[14:00:45] <astroo-> those who want to help in a project that will be the "home" of peoples with chat and information, private me please
[14:04:10] <kirk_6606> Sorry, this is unrelated but does anyone know of a CSS irc channel? I've searched but all I've gotten are channels for counterstrike...
[14:05:36] <BillCriswell> kirk_6606: #css
[14:06:37] <kirk_6606> BillCriswell: Okay, i feel stupid now. =) thanks!
[14:06:49] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:14:17] <skypce> guys
[14:14:24] <skypce> what is wrong with this: jQuery('.item.clearfix imgBg').each(function(i)
[14:14:24] <skypce>   {
[14:14:24] <skypce>     $("#testimonial-wrapper").html($(this));
[14:14:24] <skypce> });
[14:15:09] <Cork> skypce: you most likely don't have an element <imgBg>
[14:15:15] <Cork> .imgBg ?
[14:15:40] <skypce> sorry sorry
[14:15:41] <skypce> yes
[14:15:45] <skypce> i forget the point
[14:15:51] <Cork> also you don't need to wrap this in $() to pass it to .heml()
[14:15:51] <skypce> thanky ou Cork
[14:16:03] <doug65536> skypce: I wouldn't do that
[14:16:24] <doug65536> the .html($(this)) part I mean
[14:16:46] <skypce> how needs to be so?
[14:17:12] <Cork> skypce: this is a dom element and .heml can handle them
[14:17:18] <skypce> ((this))
[14:17:24] <Cork> no need to wrap them in a jquery object before passing it in
[14:17:30] <Cork> no just .html(this)
[14:17:50] <Cork> skypce: btw another question
[14:18:01] <Cork> skypce: why replace everything in an id in a loop?
[14:18:03] <skypce> thank you people
[14:18:07] <Cork> doesn't really make sense
[14:18:16] <Cork> you will always just get the last element in the loop
[14:18:35] <skypce> i want find all images from slide that have .active class and put they to #parent-div
[14:18:51] <skypce> do you know some way to do this¿
[14:18:52] <doug65536> skypce: all but the last iteration of the loop will be overwritten
[14:19:00] <Cork> .html won't do that
[14:19:05] <Cork> you want .append
[14:19:16] <skypce> ok
[14:19:18] <skypce> i will test
[14:19:33] <Cork> skypce: and when we're at it :)
[14:19:38] <Cork> you can remove the loop ^^'
[14:19:46] <skypce> i have many images
[14:19:52] <skypce> mmm doesnt change
[14:19:59] <skypce> http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/italia2/index.html
[14:20:13] <Cork> jQuery('.item.clearfix .imgBg').appendTo("#testimonial-wrapper");
[14:20:25] <Cork> that should do the same thing as your loop
[14:21:19] <skypce> it doesnt change image when carousel go to next slide
[14:21:43] <skypce> can you check the site for see behaviour
[14:21:51] <skypce> http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/italia2/index.html
[14:22:05] <skypce> u:preview p:querty2014
[14:24:51] <Cork> where is the script?
[14:26:00] <skypce> http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/italia2/js/theme.js
[14:26:06] <astroo-> who not help lose the chance with the project, maybe becomes the biggest and best thing on the internet if peoples want and go alive   bye people
[14:26:24] <skypce> Cork, it begin from line 25 :)
[14:26:42] <tw2113> what project did i miss out on from astroo- ?
[14:26:52] <skypce> i am nulled for jquery :S

[14:29:51] <skypce> sure
[14:29:53] <skypce> :)
[14:30:16] <skypce> Cork do you understand the problem?
[14:30:35] <tw2113> astroo-, i wasn't actually interested in participating, i just wanted to see what it was about
[14:30:44] <Cork> skypce: still trying to understand the page
[14:30:54] <tw2113> allo Cork
[14:31:07] <Cork> o/
[14:31:18] <astroo-> a project that will be the "home" of peoples with chat and information, private me please
[14:33:24] <Cork> skypce: ok, i think i've groked what your trying to do
[14:34:01] <Cork> skypce: only thing i can't find yet is prettyPhoto meant to do the animation?
[14:34:18] <skypce> mmm no it is right
[14:34:20] <skypce> no problem with it
[14:35:49] <Cork> skypce: my point was you said "change image when carousel go to next slide"
[14:36:32] <Cork> skypce: but i can't find anything hooking into what ever is doing the carousel
[14:36:56] <skypce> the image is inside item.clearfix
[14:37:01] <skypce> the first item inside it
[14:37:06] <skypce> i need move to parent folder
[14:37:20] <skypce> for use all width
[14:37:26] <skypce> of page
[14:38:36] <Cork> uh
[14:38:55] <Cork> then i'm not sure i actually follow what you're trying to do
[14:38:59] <aliocha> hi everyone !
[14:39:41] <Cork> skypce: so you don't want the red banner to change with the carousel?
[14:39:57] <skypce> yes
[14:40:04] <skypce> i want that change it
[14:40:22] <skypce> in a beginning it is green
[14:40:29] <Cork> but the script you added moves the images OUT of the carousel
[14:40:29] <skypce> i dont know why show red
[14:40:37] <skypce> yes
[14:40:49] <Cork> meaning the carousel won't affect them
[14:41:07] <skypce> mmm
[14:41:23] <skypce> yes you are right
[14:41:26] <skypce> mm
[14:41:37] <skypce> ok i will try to do this with css
[14:41:40] <skypce> thank you anyway
[14:41:44] <Cork> np
[14:45:36] <Alina-malina> is it possible to see live what is happening in database (user registration, sessions track) with jquery or should i use some socketio stuff? so it show in reali time?
[16:17:36] <shoky> i'll just put this here ... http://i.imgur.com/JC0faZc.jpg
[16:17:49] <shoky> sfw
[16:19:07] <tw2113> oh god what is that in the background shoky
[16:20:08] <shoky> oo didn't notice that
[16:20:33] <shoky> looks like a yummy cartridge
[16:20:59] <BillCriswell> It doesn't look real.
[16:21:07] <tw2113> it looks shopped
[16:21:13] <tw2113> and i've seen some shops in my day
[16:21:21] <shoky> no it's real ok
[16:21:27] <shoky> don't make me mad
[16:21:29] <tw2113> a real shop, we know
[16:21:32] <tw2113> :D
[16:21:51] <BillCriswell> Haha I don't know if it's shopped or not, but something about it doesn't seem real.
[16:22:43] <tw2113> i wish my nose would stop showing off with how consistently it can run
[16:22:46] <shoky> nice eyes + whole face distortion
[16:22:54] <shoky> + who knows how this dog looks normally
[16:23:04] <shoky> = no shop. Grrr
[16:24:47] <tw2113> i meant the background being shopped, not the dog
[16:25:02] <shoky> oh. you're even wronger then
[16:25:11] <shoky> soon you'll say this is a shop http://i.imgur.com/wB3xJdm.jpg
[16:26:04] <tw2113> you want a shop? I'll show you a shop http://shopfrontelegy.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/baconshop-cambridgest-aylesbury-hp20-6333_1200.jpg

[16:27:28] <Horacsio> hi, why doesn’t this http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/sd9cT/1/ shows and hide the menu on mouseover?! or hover?
[16:28:20] <tw2113> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:28:44] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/sd9cT/
[16:29:18] <maxer> anyone use the jquery file uploader? i cant seem to get the example to work-
[16:29:20] <tw2113> same error
[16:29:33] <tw2113> Horacsio, you don't have jQuery loaded
[16:31:04] <Horacsio> but I do now… (I think) http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/sd9cT/
[16:31:22] <tw2113> TypeError: $(...).hoverIntent is not a function
[16:32:15] <Horacsio> is not?! :S f....
[16:32:16] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/sd9cT/
[16:32:27] <tw2113> Horacsio, do you even have your browser console open?
[16:33:20] <tw2113> this hoverintent? http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[16:33:39] <Horacsio> I’m sorry tw but got this from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6539835/jquery-menu-slide-up-from-from-bottom-of-screen-on-hover and I though… well I thought it should be controled… :(
[16:33:40] <tw2113> gonna need to load that via external resource
[16:34:03] <tw2113> at least for the sake of your jsfiddle
[16:36:37] <Horacsio> can I load http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.js in that external field? just by pasting the url?
[16:37:02] <tw2113> try it and see
[16:44:38] <Horacsio> tried and stilll doesnt work…
[16:45:25] <Horacsio> I want to hover Catergories word
[16:49:13] <ophi491> Is the setInterval method okay to use?
[16:51:00] <wewillc> ophi491, for?
[16:51:30] <wewillc> I may have missed the first part of that conversation lol
[16:56:49] <m312> ...I have a list of links in a ordered list
[16:57:01] <systemfault> ophi491: No, it’s a method that should be forgotten. http://www.erichynds.com/blog/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern
[16:57:02] <ophi491> wewillc Just in general, is it one of those things everybody avoids?
[16:57:17] <m312> I want to capture every link click and instead of having the page reload, I want jquery to capture the link and load the contents in a div
[16:57:20] <m312> how ?
[16:57:29] <ophi491> systemfault oh okay
[16:59:29] <ophi491> systemfault thanks for the  link
[16:59:37] <systemfault> You’re welcome
[17:03:10] <ophi491> m312 I dont really know what you mean. You want to load the html of the clicked page into a div? or the link itself
[17:08:42] <anom> http://jsfiddle.net/JPE4M/ is there a better way to remove all .active classes when clicked anywhere on the screen?
[17:20:25] <usaaabb> hi anom, with  var self = $(this);
[17:20:42] <usaaabb> do you set the same button
[17:20:43] <wewillc> m312, so then you want to do $("a").click(function(e){e.preventDefault();}); and then have the click do an ajax request into a div?
[17:21:57] <anom> usaaabb, var self would be the clicked .dropdown element. Though I've sinced updated the code here: http://jsfiddle.net/JPE4M/1/ I think this is better.
[17:22:17] <anom> But i'm not happy with writing - $('.dropdown').removeClass('active'); twice :(
[17:27:43] <wewillc> m312: For example: $("a").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $.ajax({url:$(this).attr('href'),success:function(result){$("#div1").html(result); }});});
[17:43:39] <irdan> has anyone used select2 in the following way: initialize a list of tags from localstorage, and query a remote source if a new tag is entered?
[17:45:04] <wb_twerp_> when two divs are placed inline one is slightly below the other
[17:45:08] <wb_twerp_> why does that happen ?
[17:45:16] <wb_twerp_> ofcourse table > table-cell fixes it
[17:50:45] <BillCris_> wb_twerp_: You mean display inline?
[17:56:21] <wb_twerp_> display:inline-block;
[17:59:30] <BillCriswell> wb_twerp_: They should be at the top unless you're doing something else interesting.
[18:03:53] <wb_twerp_> BillCriswell: example here - http://jsfiddle.net/wbsrvc/UMQLn/
[18:06:29] <Crucials> wb_twerp_: one of them is height 100%, and then other height 100px
[18:06:45] <BillCriswell> wb_twerp_: vertical alignment as well.
[18:06:58] <BillCriswell> The default vertical alignment would be baseline I believe.
[18:08:02] <BillCriswell> Yes. So if you have one at 100px and one at 100% that'll have them aligned at the "bottom"ish
[18:08:35] <wb_twerp_> BillCriswell: silly me, yeah vertical-align:top would align them to top
[18:08:38] <wb_twerp_> thanks
[18:09:18] <BillCriswell> wb_twerp_: You have to be careful with vertical align
[18:09:25] <BillCriswell> I mean inline-block*
[18:09:52] <BillCriswell> You should probably be using floats here.
[18:14:55] <wb_twerp_> BillCriswell: why are floats a better option. I have two child divs that renders 2 thirdparty grids side-by-side. Toggling only one grid and resizing other doesn't work well in case of floats.
[18:15:04] <wb_twerp_> table > table-cell just works
[18:17:18] <BillCriswell> wb_twerp_: inline-block brings weird margins in.
[18:33:25] <wa5ted> you know how someone can create a table using css propertt 'display: table' , etc.  is there anyway to specify the number of cells that a single cell can cover
[18:33:36] <wa5ted> what i mean by that is say a standard cell covers 4 units in a row
[18:33:53] <wa5ted> so a row has 4 cells each covers 4 units
[18:33:57] <wa5ted> so 16 units per row
[18:34:02] <wa5ted> what if in row 2
[18:34:09] <wa5ted> i want a 2 cells
[18:34:23] <wa5ted> with 1 cell covering 4 units and the other cell covering 12 units
[18:34:27] <wa5ted> how can i specify this in css
[18:34:47] <wa5ted> ^ any ideas
[18:34:56] <wb_twerp_> i am not sure if that is possible.. haven't seen any such property.. there is one on i think the table element
[18:34:58] <wb_twerp_> colspan
[18:35:29] <wa5ted> wb_twerp_: the table i hae built doesnt use the table tags but rather the css properties for display: such as table, row, cell
[18:35:37] <wa5ted> i figured colspan would do it
[18:35:46] <wa5ted> but in this case i want to do it this way
[18:35:55] <wa5ted> perhaps i can specify the width of each cell?
[18:36:50] <wb_twerp_> yeah that should work.
[18:37:09] <wb_twerp_> but that is still js solution ?
[18:37:18] <wa5ted> nope
[18:37:22] <wa5ted> i think it can be done via css
[18:37:36] <wa5ted> but usually jquery people are css ninjas so i asked here :)
[18:39:08] <wa5ted> wb_twerp_:  also is there anyway to css positio cell text to the right hand side of each cell
[18:39:12] <wa5ted> and slightly over flow
[18:39:18] <wa5ted> so as to be on the right edge of every cell
[19:00:59] <LoneStar99> hello need help parsing some json, with multiple arrays -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23586431/how-to-format-json-parent-child-array-for-json-parsing
[19:01:08] <wb_twerp_> wa5ted: yeah by dynamic I was thinking that cells aredynamic
[19:01:31] <wa5ted> yeah
[19:01:43] <wa5ted> wb_twerp_: dont sweat onmy question i decided to go another way for now
[19:01:54] <wa5ted> the project is a proof of concept and displaying the content
[19:02:03] <wa5ted> i can do another way
[19:02:06] <wa5ted> thanks for your help :)
[19:02:44] <wb_twerp_> wa5ted: text-align: right on table-cell works, i guess
[19:02:52] <wa5ted> true
[19:02:53] <wb_twerp_> damn this css should have an irc channel
[19:02:57] <wb_twerp_> where ppl respond :D
[19:03:01] <wa5ted> lol
[19:03:30] <wa5ted> wb_twerp_: ive learned over time that #jquery is good enough, the people here must be css ninjas to be any good at helping you out with jquery
[19:04:50] <LoneStar99> anyone here know how to parse json with multiple arrays?
[19:05:27] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: It seems like you just want to loop through .response?
[19:06:34] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: I can loop through "instances" successfully, but a no go with "pricing"  ...
[19:07:14] <LoneStar99> JSON is valid, but perhaps it is not formatted correctly for desired results??
[19:07:26] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: It's valid, but you're over writing values.
[19:07:41] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: http://pastie.org/pastes/9164121/text
[19:08:59] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: After that's parsed you only have 1 pricing and 1 instances property to go through.
[19:10:59] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: console.log( flavors ); and just poke around in there.
[19:12:05] <RedstoneSheep> I got this really weird problem with ajax(). It won't call _any_ callbacks, although the request is made an succeeds
[19:12:41] <RedstoneSheep> It's a post to the same host using a relative URL
[19:13:00] <RedstoneSheep> datatype is text, so it can't be any json errors
[19:13:25] <BillCriswell> RedstoneSheep: What happens if you don't set a dataType?
[19:13:39] <RedstoneSheep> BillCriswell: same, aka nothing
[19:14:00] <BillCriswell> Did you spell success or done right? Have any code to look at?
[19:14:19] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: pretty much what I need is the following format -> http://pastebin.com/xrEW1aCJ
[19:15:45] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: You can't get that with the way your data is set up. You'll need to change the JSON.
[19:16:20] <RedstoneSheep> BillCriswell: yes it's definitely spelled right, will share code in a sec
[19:17:07] <RedstoneSheep> $.ajax('/tools/render_markdown', {type: 'post', data: {text: 'test'}, success: function(data) {console.log('hello')} })
[19:17:19] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: yeah reformatting, but can you provide the simple syntax, kinda lost...
[19:18:14] <BillCriswell> RedstoneSheep: Is there an error in the console form some other script?
[19:18:33] <RedstoneSheep> BillCriswell: nope, nothing
[19:18:46] <BillCriswell> What if you add error: function(){ console.log('nope'); }
[19:18:59] <RedstoneSheep> BillCriswell: still nothing
[19:19:30] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: I can't do anything for you with that JSON. You need to set it up so it comes out in a way where you can do that.
[19:23:57] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell:  ok rewriting
[19:25:13] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: what jquery version?
[19:25:43] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: how does this syntax look -> http://pastebin.com/a4rnPerA
[19:26:12] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: uh, it comes with ruby on rails. can I check via console somehow?
[19:26:19] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: jQuery.fn.jquery
[19:27:20] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: 1.10.1
[19:27:29] <skypce> hello all
[19:27:38] <shoky> ok then it's not what i suspected ;S
[19:27:47] <skypce> i need a plugin for do this bars: http://imagebin.org/310146 what do you recommend me please?
[19:28:16] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: there's nothing wrong about your code snippet. got this online?
[19:29:17] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: no just local, i'll try xmlhttprequest and see if that gives me any more information
[19:29:46] <shoky> you see the request succeeding in the devtools network tab?
[19:31:05] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: oooh, I think I figured it. The site has http basic auth, I just forgot cause the browser cached it. Wondering why jquery doesn't give me any errors though
[19:31:21] <BillCriswell> skypce: jQuery UI Slider can work.
[19:31:32] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: it's responding 403?
[19:31:47] <BillCriswell> skypce: http://jqueryui.com/slider/#steps most notably
[19:32:03] <skypce> thank you BillCriswell
[19:32:05] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: hmm actually no. this wasn't the problem
[19:32:32] <BillCriswell> skypce: Googled a bit and came across this, should get you 80% there. http://jsfiddle.net/6zqFq/305/
[19:33:31] <skypce> thank you BillCriswell i will use the last
[19:38:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:57:10] <RedstoneSheep> BillCriswell, shoky: i'm still having trouble. the request is successful, returns an http 200 and the expected body. but it just won't execute any callbacks. it's so frustrating..
[19:58:04] <RedstoneSheep> also, using xmlhttprequest worked, however that won't explain why it doesn't work with jquery
[19:58:35] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: maybe rails has some script that's messing with it ?
[19:58:53] <shoky> i know i've seen rails people using jquery do stuff like  .on('ajax:success')  and shit like that
[19:59:00] <shoky> no idea about it myself
[19:59:32] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: yes it adds a few things, but afaik it doesn't modify anything
[20:00:38] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: i'll try with vanilla jquery
[20:01:46] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: same result with vanilla jquery
[20:02:31] <shoky> can you post the full code for the jquery one and the xhr one, and also show the request and response from the network tab
[20:02:38] <shoky> that, or set up a live link ;p
[20:03:07] <shoky> also what exactly do you mean by vanilla jquery
[20:03:13] <Marquez> hello i have a problem with lavalamp
[20:03:14] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... github is down?
[20:03:17] <shoky> yep
[20:03:32] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: I just mean original jquery that's definitely not touched by rails
[20:03:46] <shoky> oks
[20:05:40] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: i tried $.post, but that's the same problem. it works but no callbacks
[20:07:32] <shoky> yea $.post is just a shortcut to $.ajax
[20:08:37] <RedstoneSheep> i know, I thought maybe it would show me something that gets me any further
[20:12:18] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: I give up, I'll use xmlhttprequest.
[20:12:30] <RedstoneSheep> thanks for trying to help, though
[20:12:30] <shoky> why not do what i asked
[20:12:45] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: must have missed it, what did you say?
[20:12:56] <shoky> <shoky> can you post the full code for the jquery one and the xhr one, and also show the request and response from the network tab  <shoky> that, or set up a live link ;p
[20:13:17] <RedstoneSheep> ok, sec
[20:19:11] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: code for jquery/xml: http://hastebin.com/iwahipuyab.js
[20:20:21] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: network inspector: https://i.imgur.com/6peS0Kg.png
[20:22:46] <edrahn> Is there any way to get the values a form would submit, without parsing the dom?
[20:27:50] <shoky> RedstoneSheep: no idea, sry. something else must be going on there
[20:28:13] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: okay, thanks for the help. I'll stick to xml then
[20:28:15] <BillCriswell> edrahn: You can use .serializeArray()
[20:28:46] <edrahn> BillCriswell: thanks
[20:29:09] <shoky> er
[20:29:19] <BillCriswell> What happened there? haha
[20:29:22] <shoky> spammer
[20:29:27] <BillCriswell> Ewwwwwwww
[20:29:28] <shoky> in PM
[20:35:44] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: interesting. it doesn't work in FF but works in chromium
[20:40:25] <RedstoneSheep> shoky: All of a sudden it works. I didn't change a tiny bit of the code. WTF firefox!
[20:41:40] <shoky> derp
[20:46:31] <LoneStar99> would it be overkill for jquery to compare json parameters from two different resultsets or should that be done via mysql and php?
[21:00:25] <dman777_alter> ugh...how can I get chromium to stop automatically pausing in the debugger when jquery is loaded?
[22:04:57] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: decided to scratch that complex json and keep it simple... thanks
[22:05:10] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: No problem!
[22:05:40] <duch_kazatel> happy saturday folks
[22:08:10] <duch_kazatel> wow.  dead in here tonight.
[22:10:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha it is
[22:10:25] <duch_kazatel> how goes, BillCriswell?
[22:10:35] <duch_kazatel> isn't it like 1 over there right niw?
[22:10:37] <duch_kazatel> *now
[22:10:44] <BillCriswell> It goes it goes. Watching It's Always Sunny.
[22:10:50] <duch_kazatel> nice
[22:10:58] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah. Didn't feel like going out tonight for whatever reason.
[22:11:25] <duch_kazatel> you sound like a homeowner.
[22:11:34] <duch_kazatel> or, as my mom would say, like you're ready to have kids.
[22:11:46] <BillCriswell> Haha either.
[22:13:12] <duch_kazatel> I finally got fluid for my humidor again so i've been nursing some stuff back to health including some really good pipe tobaccos.
[22:14:35] <BillCriswell> Nice. Never got into smoking anything really.
[22:17:56] <duch_kazatel> i quit smoking cigarettes a little over 2 years ago, but cigars and pipes stuck around.
[22:19:11] <BillCriswell> I think being around 2 parents smoking a 2 packs a day my whole life just kind of ruined me haha
[22:19:40] <duch_kazatel> my parents were like that originally too!  they both quit.  you'd think i woulda never picked up.
[22:20:27] <BillCriswell> Mine are still going strong. Drives me nuts.
[22:20:41] <duch_kazatel> that's rough.
[22:21:47] <BillCriswell> I mean luckily I don't live at home, just visiting is tough.
[22:23:22] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet.  that can't be fun to be around.
[22:25:46] <duch_kazatel> I am getting more and more interested in rust, which sucks because my compyany has no real interest in using it.
[22:26:13] <BillCriswell> Don't even actually know what that is.
[22:27:26] <BillCriswell> Seems interesting.
[22:27:34] <duch_kazatel> it's a language being written by a dude at mozilla.  it's being used for their Servo layout engine and seems pretty promising.
[22:30:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell working on anything interesting?
[22:31:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Right now just messing with browserify / gulp. I really need to think up something and just build it instead of just working on the best work flow haha
[22:31:48] <duch_kazatel> haha
[22:31:59] <BillCriswell> browserify is pretty sweet though
[22:32:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah?  doesn't it let you ship node packages to the browser or something?
[22:32:32] <BillCriswell> Yes, pretty easily too.
[22:33:04] <BillCriswell> The file it makes is pretty big... but it's pretty easy to manage things.
[22:33:14] <BillCriswell> I like handling things through npm
[22:33:41] <duch_kazatel> npm splitting from node was a smart smart smart choice.
[22:34:38] <Genitrust> hey guys, any idea why the jquery doesn't work at *all* on this page?
[22:34:40] <BillCriswell> You mean npm doesn't come with node anymore?
[22:34:40] <Genitrust> wallofcoins.com
[22:34:46] <duch_kazatel> wallofcoins.com
[22:34:50] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[22:34:59] <duch_kazatel> and I mean npm is now a separate org.
[22:35:33] <BillCriswell> Ohhh
[22:35:35] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust what isn't working?
[22:36:30] <Genitrust> when you click "private invitation", nothing happens
[22:36:33] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust i can see and use jQuery on the page right now.
[22:36:33] <Genitrust> it should respond
[22:36:39] <Genitrust> with firefox?
[22:36:43] <Genitrust> oh whoops, i forgot that detail -.-
[22:36:49] <Genitrust> this doesn't work with firefox
[22:36:51] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust yep.  clicking that link throws a 500.
[22:36:56] <BillCriswell> Genitrust: Haha oh.
[22:37:10] <Genitrust> duch_kazatel: what link?
[22:37:14] <Genitrust> (the "button" link?)
[22:37:34] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/VQqfmtN.png
[22:37:47] <duch_kazatel> the "private invitation" button.
[22:37:52] <Genitrust> oooh "console -> all" i didn't know that
[22:38:10] <Genitrust> man, i get nothing under there -.-
[22:38:34] <duch_kazatel> your django server is throwing an error about country_code.
[22:38:53] <Genitrust> can you show me more about the error?
[22:38:59] <duch_kazatel> http://wallofcoins.com/api/sendInviteCode
[22:39:07] <duch_kazatel> hit that - what do you get there?
[22:39:18] <duch_kazatel> "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'country_code'"
[22:39:44] <Genitrust> i mean, when you click the button, does the request send parameters to the API?
[22:40:39] <duch_kazatel> looks like there's a 'phone' param that's empty.
[22:40:51] <duch_kazatel> the csrfmiddlewaretoken has a value though
[22:41:11] <Genitrust> interesting
[22:41:23] <Genitrust> i wonder if the javascript is unable to grab the 'phone' value correctly?
[22:41:34] <duch_kazatel> i didn't enter a phone value ;)
[22:41:49] <Genitrust> oh lol
[22:41:53] <Genitrust> now try entering one :D
[22:41:55] <duch_kazatel> oddly enough, i can;t enter anything.
[22:42:18] <Genitrust> wtf? javascript disabled in my firefox? haha
[22:42:29] <duch_kazatel> where's your code?
[22:42:50] <Genitrust> http://wallofcoins.com/static/wallofcoins/js/main.js
[22:43:44] <Genitrust> sweet, ok now i at least have a lead... now that my javascript is enabled lol
[22:43:47] <Genitrust> thanks for your time :) i appreciate it
[22:43:49] <duch_kazatel> brb
[22:43:54] <Genitrust> you do any coin stuff btw?
[22:45:52] <duch_kazatel> all right.  and no i don't.
[22:47:15] <duch_kazatel> btw i'd rather you didn't pm me ;)
[22:47:29] <Genitrust> ok:)
[22:47:45] <Genitrust> have you heard of any of those digital coins?
[22:47:53] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Night dude.
[22:48:12] <duch_kazatel> Genitrust which?
[22:48:20] <Genitrust> 'any'
[22:48:27] <Genitrust> i guess there's just... so many -.-
[22:48:34] <duch_kazatel> yea, tons of them.  bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, etc.
[22:49:59] <Genitrust> oooh, in firefox, does a function passed to keyup event need to have an event returned?
[22:50:28] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[22:51:03] <Genitrust> ah, i see now the problem is in the javascript...
[22:51:30] <duch_kazatel> line 379 - that func
[22:52:41] <Genitrust> ya i see now.. thanks!
[22:52:46] <Genitrust> i'm using a javascript lint. should've used that before
[22:52:54] <Genitrust> our js dev will now know this @.@
[22:53:23] <duch_kazatel> wait.  87
[22:53:25] <duch_kazatel> that func
[22:54:39] <duch_kazatel> either way, one of those two.  maybe both
[22:56:05] <duch_kazatel> something seems off with that init - i would watch the input change event personally.  let the user actually finish their input, but that's me.
[23:30:49] <edoop> Do you have listened about an example to get all posts  of a fb public group using API ?. I want make an intelligent app cross-mobile device

[23:46:09] <duch_kazatel> that's hours away from me.
[23:47:12] <edoop> i always  regard  your area when native digital ignore history of web
[23:47:58] <duch_kazatel> "my area" is pretty far away from where you're thinking of.
[23:49:35] <edoop> In my region of italy DSL cable has arribed  more or less 8 years ago
[23:50:19] <edoop> we have been  happy when it will arribed :)
[23:50:22] <the_last> hiya, is there a way to go to a parent by referencing it? atm i've having to do: $(this).parent().parent() to go back 2 parents, but the problem is i need to do it conditionally, and so the number of steps back varies. if i could do $(this).parentwithclass(".comment") and it'd go directly to the parent with that class regardless of how many steps back it is that'd solve my problem, but $(this).parent(".selector") doesn't seem to do that
[23:50:56] <duch_kazatel> edoop imagine driving from rome to prato - that's about how far i am from silicon valley :)_
[23:51:12] <duch_kazatel> the_last you want .parents()
[23:51:35] <duch_kazatel> the_last .parents('.comment')
[23:51:59] <the_last> dutch_kazatel: hmm that didn't seem to work either :/
[23:52:14] <the_last> ill try again
[23:52:18] <the_last> maybe i did something wrong
[23:52:19] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you suing?
[23:52:22] <duch_kazatel> *using?
[23:52:55] <the_last> duch_kazatel: v1.11.0
[23:53:01] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it?
[23:53:07] <duch_kazatel> a small working example, i mean.
[23:53:11] <the_last> okay ill try
[23:54:19] <duch_kazatel> heads up - my battery is about to die :)
[23:54:21] <edoop> Duch_kazatel  about  my question  i mean if you have  an idea  or to know  an example to get all post by public facebook group
[23:54:40] <edoop> I want extract the initial post :)
[23:55:05] <duch_kazatel> edoop http://stackoverflow.com/a/22839769/923919
[23:55:25] <duch_kazatel> edoop go read up on FQL.
[23:56:21] <edoop> sorry i ignore mean  of FQL ... facebook library?
[23:56:42] <duch_kazatel> !a facebook fql
[23:56:47] <duch_kazatel> !g facebook fql
[23:56:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Facebook Query Language (FQL) Reference - Facebook Developers → https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/
[23:57:17] <duch_kazatel> edoop facebook's documentation is pretty good.  hit up their API docs for more info.
[23:58:13] <edoop> sure.  Just  need  a brief example by js  , i will see your hint
[23:58:31] <edoop> I want to lead  an idea
[23:58:32] <duch_kazatel> edoop learn how to craft your own example ;)
[23:59:23] <the_last> duch_kazatel: hopefully i can get it finished before then haha
[23:59:46] <duch_kazatel> the_last you've got like 5 minutes at best >.>
