[00:03:59] <django_> how can i find
[00:04:05] <django_> <select name='something'
[02:04:39] <behzad900> hello i want a question
[02:18:37] <robhol> :3
[02:36:02] <jangoh> hi! i have a AJAX call that return PHP array like array('january' => 12, 'February' > 10)  i want to convert the array to js var from response data array  to  labels : ["January","February"]   and chartdata : [12,10]    for my chart
[02:36:29] <Cork> jangoh: so your returning unparsed php?
[02:36:35] <Cork> or do you mean you generate json?
[02:37:02] <Stummi> there should be some php libs to produce json
[02:37:09] <Cork> no
[02:37:14] <Cork> it is built into the language
[02:37:21] <Cork> json_encode
[02:37:24] <Stummi> yeah, or this
[02:37:39] <Cork> (or something like that... was a while since i used it last)
[02:37:42] <Stummi> don't know anything about php :)
[02:37:58] <jangoh> Cork its wordpress loop and storing data like this   $data = array(date("F", strtotime($order->order_date)) => $inc )
[02:38:17] <Cork> jangoh: if you want help with php your in the wrong channel
[02:38:25] <robhol> and wrong language
[02:38:29] <Cork> jangoh: javascript can't parse php
[02:38:56] <Cork> jangoh: look at the response from the server in the browsers network tab
[02:39:09] <Cork> jangoh: grab what it returns and put it into a jsfiddle
[02:39:36] <jangoh> Array
[02:39:36] <jangoh> (
[02:39:36] <jangoh>     [November] => 3
[02:39:36] <jangoh> )
[02:39:36] <jangoh> Array
[02:39:42] <Cork> O_o
[02:39:48] <Cork> ok then you have a problem
[02:39:56] <jangoh> its the ajax response
[02:39:57] <Cork> that is php data dump
[02:40:04] <Cork> it isn't something javascript can use
[02:40:20] <jangoh> maybe i need to parse before return?
[02:40:30] <Cork> no you need to convert it to json
[02:40:30] <Stummi> jangoh, fix the php side
[02:40:37] <Cork> in php
[03:11:17] <jangoh> Fork thanx json_encode($data);   works
[03:11:49] <jangoh> var result = $.parseJSON(data);
[03:11:50] <jangoh>                     $.each(result, function(k, v) {
[03:11:50] <jangoh>                         labeldata.push(k);
[03:11:50] <jangoh>                         chartdata.push(v);
[03:11:50] <jangoh>                     });
[03:12:12] <jangoh> this is my loop to get data and works perfect for map :)
[03:12:43] <jangoh> Cork :)
[03:13:14] <Cork> jangoh: no, that is the wrong solution
[03:13:30] <Cork> jangoh: set the response header to be correct and you won't need $.parseJSON
[03:14:59] <jangoh> may be there is better work around will check later thanx bbl
[03:33:03] <DreamStiffler> hi guys. im trying to do a tool tip on a form. once submit, whicever field that is filled incorrectly will show tooltip. Tool tip will dissapear when the field is clicked. How do i do this?
[03:33:38] <Cork> DreamStiffler: what are you using for tooltip?
[03:35:05] <DreamStiffler> Cork: i was looking for javascript but found jquery
[03:35:12] <DreamStiffler> Cork: if thats what you mean
[03:35:17] <Cork> it wasn't :)
[03:35:47] <Cork> i mean are you use <input title="tooltip message"> or do you want to use a javascript lib for the tooltip?
[03:41:22] <DreamStiffler> Cork: javascript
[03:41:32] <Cork> uh
[03:42:01] <Cork> no i mean do you want to modify the tooltip shown through title="" or do you want to use a custom tooltip solution?
[03:42:07] <Cork> if the later you would have to pick one first
[03:42:47] <DreamStiffler> Cork: custom tooltip sir
[03:42:52] <DreamStiffler> maam
[03:42:57] <Cork> ok, then look around for one you want to use
[03:45:06] <DreamStiffler> Cork: ok maybe ill go for th etitle
[03:45:19] <DreamStiffler> Cork: coz im not sure what a customized tooltype is like
[03:45:58] <Cork> DreamStiffler: hmm, actually you know tooltip normally only show on mouse over?
[03:46:24] <Cork> are you sure you don't mean to just show validation messages along side the field?
[03:47:21] <DreamStiffler> Cork: i do know that it normally shows on mouse over. Ok yeah validation along side the field sounds OK but just that i have some field beside each other with no space.
[03:47:36] <DreamStiffler> Cork: thats why i prefer tool tip so it hovers over
[03:50:20] <Cork> DreamStiffler: you might want to look into something like http://qtip2.com/demos/
[03:50:35] <Cork> where you can control when the overlay is shown
[03:52:29] <DreamStiffler> Cork: saw something like qtip just now. didnt realize theres qtip2. thanks. looking at it now
[03:57:58] <km4> hi
[03:58:44] <km4> why this code: if($(window).width()<1200){}); dont work good if refresh web ?
[03:58:52] <DreamStiffler> Cork: apparently this is too much to study for a quick fix. but interesting. thanks anyway
[03:59:09] <Cork> km4: where are you running it?
[03:59:22] <Cork> DreamStiffler: np
[04:48:18] <DreamStiffler> Hi guys i tried json...newbie question here
[04:48:40] <DreamStiffler> Can i ask a little about json here? its not syntax or code...just the logic
[04:48:56] <DreamStiffler> What i mean is the idea.
[04:50:21] <DreamStiffler> Whats the difference if i create a page which would have tables with each row has 2 columns which is name and age. And compared to a page/txt file that has {name:ali,age:baba} in json?
[04:50:28] <DreamStiffler> the two is the same no?
[05:18:09] <fattest> When I submit a form, my jquery does " e.preventDefault();" so it prevents the page from refreshing. I do my ajax processing from there, eg if username == "" etc. How do I exit, or return, out of the function now?
[05:18:18] <fattest> if I do "return false", it refreshes the page
[05:18:46] <Pazician_> How can I transform this to work with addresses instead of long and lat? the .js file: http://pastebin.com/4muQiP4H JSON file: http://pastebin.com/bYy0ES7m
[07:37:56] <Daghdha> How/where should i fill the error in my file collection with templated file uploads simitar to:  <tr class="template-download{{if error}} ui-state-error{{/if}}">
[07:38:06] <Daghdha> I set the error value but it doesn't seem to be used by the template
[07:40:12] <Daghdha> I think i just putting it in wrong location or the template is not right. I see the uploaded bad file, it just doesn't g et flagged with my error message
[07:40:53] <taplar> is that javascript?  never seen that syntax in js
[07:42:58] <Daghdha> It is inside <script id="template-download" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">
[07:43:44] <taplar> interesting
[07:45:25] <taplar> idk much about that, but here's a page some dude is talking about it http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-working-with-the-official-jquery-templating-plugin--net-14991
[07:47:23] <Daghdha> seems like it could help me further, thanks. i will have anotehr stab at it
[07:48:48] <Duikb00t> owlslider users heree?
[07:49:04] <Duikb00t> I have no 1 slide and I don't want the slider to go back to 1 on autoplay I want to loop it :D
[07:49:45] <Mark___> how do i make this script automatically execute without me clicking on the button? anyone? http://imgur.com/kOYFux0
[07:50:35] <taplar> just execute the function?
[07:58:06] <jak2000> is possible in an ajax function return html and a json? (or a variable)? thanks
[07:58:57] <taplar> jak2000: what do you mean 'return'?  the endpoint or the method?
[07:59:01] <jak2000> when do the .done?
[07:59:10] <jak2000> }).done(function (xhtml) {
[07:59:15] <taplar> ah
[07:59:22] <jak2000> here the ajax return an html right>
[07:59:22] <taplar> sure, your endpoint can return html
[07:59:26] <jak2000> is possible return both?
[07:59:32] <jak2000> a json variable?
[07:59:34] <taplar> one at a time, or together?
[07:59:46] <jak2000> same time
[08:00:08] <taplar> you can, however you'll need to structure your response so you know how to get the two separate pieces
[08:01:09] <taplar> you could always stick the html in as one of the json key value pairs fwiw
[08:01:30] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/zvyh <--- what's wrong with this? I don't see it in DOM
[08:02:07] <taplar> Kartagis: did you put a console.log in there to see that it is being called?
[08:02:21] <jak2000> understood
[08:02:26] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[08:05:00] <Kartagis> taplar: yea, console.log(canvas) is producing results
[08:05:23] <taplar> length of > 0 i assume?
[08:08:11] <Kartagis> taplar: hrm, length = 0 but I thought I'd see them in markup
[08:08:20] <Kartagis> guess I was wrong
[08:08:24] <taplar> 0 would mean it's not finding the elements your looking for
[08:08:34] <manrig> Can anyone help me troubleshoot owl-carousel ? https://github.com/smashingboxes/OwlCarousel2/issues/69 ( http://karakycandles.com.au )
[08:08:52] <Duikb00t> taplar I think you can help me
[08:08:58] <Duikb00t> It's not with 'coding'
[08:09:13] <Duikb00t> I had to make a slider with some links after every image.. it all works fine
[08:09:21] <Duikb00t> But some external person will set it on his website .
[08:09:31] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to port it to the external user?
[08:09:43] <Duikb00t> Now I have just a index.htm file and an assets folder.
[08:09:54] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to deliver it better than that?
[08:10:27] <taplar> so you made a slider that some one else will put on their website?
[08:10:36] <Duikb00t> Yes
[08:11:36] <taplar> i'll preface this with there might be a better solution
[08:11:49] <Duikb00t> preface ?
[08:11:55] <Duikb00t> doubt?
[08:11:59] <Duikb00t> Never heard of that word :D
[08:12:11] <Duikb00t> And google translate it giving me something totaly out of context
[08:12:12] <taplar> but it would seem you'd do that by either providing the other person with the code to make the slider on their page, or they could use an iframe to display your slider
[08:12:23] <Duikb00t> bah irame :D
[08:12:26] <Duikb00t> iframe*
[08:12:27] <taplar> um
[08:12:37] <Daghdha> or they could DL it in codebehind and inject it in some rather bad practice extravaganza
[08:13:07] <taplar> http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preface
[08:13:17] <taplar> sorta like saying
[08:13:25] <Duikb00t> Oh ok
[08:13:27] <taplar> "before i say this, you should know..."
[08:13:28] <Daghdha> I say this, because i recently stumbled upon just that
[08:13:53] <Duikb00t> Normally a webdev should be able to put it on their site
[08:14:24] <Daghdha> Yes, what i suggested is insane. And frankly that DEV should be shot.
[08:16:02] <Kartagis> can I prevent user scroll?
[08:16:21] <taplar> you can set overflow:hidden in css
[08:16:55] <taplar> or possibly bind on scroll and cancel it
[08:17:23] <bojanlazic> How could I DRY this one http://jsfiddle.net/wqbts731/ ?
[08:17:50] <taplar> which part?  just the handler or...
[08:18:11] <taplar> well actually the handler is unique too
[08:18:50] <bojanlazic> :/
[08:19:14] <taplar> hold on, i got something brewing
[08:21:31] <taplar> an option: http://jsfiddle.net/wqbts731/1/
[08:23:13] <bojanlazic> oww nice one taplar
[08:23:21] <taplar> map is awesome, :)
[08:23:37] <bojanlazic> never saw it before
[08:24:04] <taplar> it lets you translate one collection of objects into another collection
[08:24:41] <Daghdha> Just had to goolge it $.map that is. Also never saw it before.
[08:25:11] <bojanlazic> thanks bro, you saved me :)
[08:25:15] <taplar> lots of times where your doing an each() over something trying to get something off of/with them, you could do it with map
[08:26:37] <Kartagis> taplar: say, I did window.location.href = "#div" and I canceled scroll. I can still go back, right?
[08:26:55] <Kartagis> this is mobile btw
[08:27:07] <taplar> ah
[08:27:37] <taplar> i would assume so, but your getting outside of my comfort zone, heh.  i've only barely played around in the moblie pool
[08:27:53] <taplar> *mobile, can't even spell it
[08:28:23] <taplar> are you trying to prevent horizontal or vertical scroll?
[08:28:35] <Kartagis> vertical
[08:29:02] <taplar> what about zoom?
[08:29:52] <taplar> oooh, yeah, that could be weird
[08:29:55] <Kartagis> I'm making an ajax call and displaying results on the same page. but I don't want to remove stuff so that I can go back. I thought of this
[08:30:44] <taplar> hmm, though maybe a zoomed pan isn't a 'scroll'
[08:30:45] <Kartagis> I'll make extra divs and add to those instead of removing everything and adding to main div
[08:31:04] <Kartagis> do you think this might work?
[08:31:49] <taplar> have you considered display: none on the 'pages' you don't want them to be able to scroll to?
[08:32:20] <taplar> i believe that's the approach that jquerymobile takes
[08:32:44] <Kartagis> yea, I'm doint that right now
[08:32:48] <Kartagis> doing
[08:33:08] <Kartagis> but instead, I thought I'd add an extra div
[08:34:00] <bojanlazic> taplar: can u check the code once again for error, something is not connected right and I check my ID's they are named animation1, animation2 etc
[08:34:58] <taplar> k, i'm going to comment out the Waypoint element in the fiddle since it's not present so that error goes away first
[08:36:36] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/wqbts731/2/
[08:37:48] <Daghdha> not getting anywhere :( How in a collection of files in json do i specifiy wich one are sicceeede and wich one filed. I see it has file.error but i don't understand how i should return it in my json
[08:38:01] <Daghdha> succeeded
[08:38:30] <taplar> Daghdha: that's all up to you, how you structure your json
[08:40:12] <Daghdha> it's part of the response to a file upload. I assume that code expects the error to be at a certain loation with certain values
[08:40:34] <Daghdha> always null now though in my .js not sure how i can get it filled from server side
[08:41:28] <taplar> what are you using to do the upload?
[08:41:49] <Daghdha> jquery-fileupload
[08:43:19] <taplar> and your doing the 'add' approach?
[08:43:27] <Daghdha> The json returned is: http://pastebin.com/2B290A9E
[08:43:44] <bojanlazic> taplar: thanks mate
[08:44:01] <taplar> bojanlazic: get it figured out?
[08:44:58] <taplar> Daghdha: oh
[08:45:05] <taplar> so it's not an 'error'
[08:45:19] <taplar> atleast from the http standpoint
[08:45:40] <Daghdha> Ah.. yes. The server has decided the file was invalid. I want to repsond in such a way blueimp/jquery-fileupload flags it as such in the GUI
[08:46:10] <Daghdha> it return 200 yes
[08:46:13] <taplar> ah, ok, so is it the Type that your talking about or?
[08:47:21] <Daghdha> No
[08:47:41] <Daghdha> Type is filled with a value if the file was valid
[08:48:04] <taplar> gotcha, so since it is not filled, Error tells you what was wrong?
[08:48:14] <Daghdha> I expect the Error in that json to be automatically used as a parameter and it BECOMES the error in the template
[08:48:35] <taplar> oh, i don't believe your going to have that automatically
[08:48:51] <taplar> your most likely going to have to write something in the success() callback that does that logic
[08:48:55] <Daghdha> it somehow knows the name though
[08:49:18] <manrig> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27006239/owl-carousel-image-not-right-size-at-first - how do I call it after DOM ? --- need help owl-carousel please..
[08:52:09] <bojanlazic> taplar: it's not working still :/
[08:52:52] <bojanlazic> http://postimg.org/image/wjbq4pp7r/
[08:53:33] <taplar> it looks like it is processing and finding the objects
[08:54:38] <bojanlazic> mhm but it's not adding the classes on scroll with waypoint
[08:55:22] <taplar> well the last modification i had on the fiddle wasn't using the waypoint.  did you change it back to construct the waypoint objects?
[08:57:56] <bojanlazic> Nah I just copy the code you gave me
[08:58:04] <taplar> :P
[08:58:17] <bojanlazic> and put it inside the $(function(){
[08:58:18] <bojanlazic> :D
[08:58:43] <taplar> i'm just some dude in a chatroom.  don't blindly copy and paste the code, ;)
[08:59:13] <bojanlazic> I don't get it really well now, which part should I modify
[08:59:14] <bojanlazic> :D
[08:59:56] <taplar> so the main part i took out last in the fiddle was the new Waypoint() around the {} object
[09:00:02] <taplar> so you'd need to put that back
[09:01:15] <bojanlazic> your referring to this new Waypoint({
[09:01:19] <taplar> yep
[09:04:15] <taplar> brb
[09:04:31] <bojanlazic> when you get back check this out http://jsfiddle.net/wqbts731/3/ :D
[09:04:44] <bojanlazic> Not even sure how to put it arround
[09:05:08] <bojanlazic> so newby sorry :/
[09:08:40] <bojanlazic> tried this also http://jsfiddle.net/wqbts731/4/ but still nothing
[09:11:46] <taplar> it'd be like the commented part above it
[09:12:02] <taplar> new Waypoint({ ..options.. })
[09:35:51] <Daghdha> Man it's driving me insane. Only thing missing is that the template doesn't know there is an error for thaht file. It does come in with json. I verified it.
[09:36:08] <Daghdha> But apparently the error in my file is not the same error as used here: <tr class="template-download{{if error}} ui-state-error{{/if}}">
[09:37:23] <taplar> well... the case is different
[09:38:21] <Daghdha> True Taplar: but same applies for <td class="name">${name}</td>
[09:38:37] <Daghdha> I can make it return a lowercase error. Don't think it matters. I will test now.
[09:40:19] <Daghdha> OMG
[09:40:39] * Daghdha gives taplar a manly hug.
[09:40:44] <taplar> my work is done!
[09:40:45] <Daghdha> That was actually it
[09:40:46] <taplar> :D
[09:41:06] * taplar drops the mic
[09:41:09] <Daghdha> I mean it does something totally unexpected. But i can figure that out :)
[10:03:50] <xenaxon> is it possible to open a local file by clicking a link????
[10:03:54] <xenaxon> the file is in the same folder as the js application
[10:03:56] <xenaxon> I want to open the file in the default windows application for the file...
[10:04:28] <xenaxon> I made a link to the file but neither the open or save popup appears.... and it doesn't do anything.
[10:32:32] <Guest56037> is "$('a:first') instanceof jQuery" equivalent to "!($('a:first') instanceof jQuery)"?
[10:32:44] <Guest56037> is "!$('a:first') instanceof jQuery" equivalent to "!($('a:first') instanceof jQuery)"?
[10:33:25] <taplar> are you doing that exact statement?
[10:33:32] <Guest56037> no
[10:33:47] <Guest56037> i am checking a function argument
[10:33:52] <taplar> gotcha
[10:35:17] <taplar> logically i believe you would need the !()
[10:35:27] <taplar> you wouldn't do the not on the variable
[10:37:17] <Guest56037> true
[10:37:29] <Guest56037> but im unable to find a way to test it
[10:37:45] <Guest56037> it seems that it doesnt matter if i put () or not
[10:40:52] <Guest56037> "The ! operator precedes the instanceof operator."
[10:40:59] <Guest56037> you were right taplar
[10:41:58] <Guest56037> in php its the other way around :)
[10:42:56] <mooncup> that's because in php it's a function
[10:43:02] <mooncup> whereas in javascript it's an operator
[11:39:16] <abishek> Is there a way to setup a jquery draggable on element that is below another DOM element?
[11:42:24] <zeroquake> any idea why jquery selector for a id returns empty while , getSelectorById returns the node
[11:42:43] <taplar> zeroquake: what are the statements?
[11:43:12] <zeroquake> $("#someid")  vs document.getSelectorById(someid)
[11:43:44] <taplar> getElementById ?
[11:44:44] <taplar> in any case if 'someid' is an id then $('#someid') should work
[11:44:44] <zeroquake> yes sorry
[11:45:02] <zeroquake> my id is like "xyz:yz:abc:bnm"
[11:45:10] <taplar> oh, nasty
[11:45:13] <zeroquake> special character is throwing jquery off
[11:45:14] <zeroquake> yup
[11:45:16] <taplar> you have to escape your :'s
[11:45:27] <zeroquake> yes , will try it out
[11:45:30] <zeroquake> thank you taplar
[11:45:49] <taplar> double slash i believe
[11:52:44] <Es0teric> how do i force an image's width using jquery?
[11:52:48] <Es0teric> because it seems that .width() isnt doing it
[11:53:03] <taplar> your doing width(value) ?
[11:53:30] <Es0teric> taplar yep
[11:53:53] <taplar> should work iirc, got an example?
[11:54:14] <Es0teric> taplar $('.header-on a img').width(168)
[11:54:32] <skinux> Anyone have experience using jQuery.sheet?
[11:55:04] <taplar_> stupid network.
[11:55:10] <taplar_> i mean like a fiddle of the issue
[11:55:36] <Es0teric> taplar nah
[11:55:38] <Es0teric> id ont have one
[11:55:44] <taplar_> cause you could fall back on css() but width() should do it
[11:57:15] <taplar_> http://jsfiddle.net/1gdmu5L8/
[11:59:00] <taplar_> you don't have any styling on the element that's doing a width: !important on it are you?
[11:59:13] <taplar_> cause that would prevent the inline style override
[12:31:53] <claytonzaugg> Can anyone recommend a good channel I can ask specific errors from JS for ie8What channel should I ask when, dealing with JS errors, if "Break on Error" is enabled by default for ie8 in dev tools?
[12:32:07] <claytonzaugg> Whoops
[12:32:11] <claytonzaugg> What channel should I ask when, dealing with JS errors, if "Break on Error" is enabled by default for ie8 in dev tools?
[12:32:26] <robertmaxrees> lol we got the idea ;)
[12:32:39] <robertmaxrees> what what does the break on error option have to do with anything?
[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm i get it - i would maybe hit up ##javascript?  browser compat is a funky thing.
[12:34:23] <claytonzaugg> Thanks robertmaxrees, and ultimately I guess it doesn't matter if it's on or not, the errors need to be fixed regardless.
[12:34:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> :) usually they're pretty trivial to fix.
[12:58:48] <martixy> Hello. My .position({ at: "top+75" }) refuses to work.
[12:59:08] <martixy> of: window...
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/position/
[12:59:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn't accept any args.
[13:00:17] <martixy> Oh, right... this is jqueryUI.
[13:00:18] <taplar> plagurist
[13:00:27] <martixy> Where it does.
[13:01:16] <robertmaxrees> dunno then - would need to see a fiddle of it broken.
[13:01:36] <martixy> Hm... let me try.
[13:02:07] <martixy> Actually nvm.
[13:02:11] <martixy> Figured it out.
[13:02:16] <robertmaxrees> awesome - what was it?
[13:03:00] <martixy> I was having a thin wrapper to handle the defaults and didn't include the position option.
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> hah - fair enough.
[13:09:36] <lyhr> when calling function showHide(shID) {....} from an <a tag will the double quotes break this? <a href="#" id="phone" onclick="showHide("numbers");return false;">More numbers...</a> VS. <a href="#" id="phone" onclick="showHide('numbers');return false;">More numbers...</a>
[13:09:48] <taplar> yes
[13:09:56] <robertmaxrees> yes, and you shouldn't use onclick anyway ;)
[13:10:12] <lyhr> uh oh why is that
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> because putting javascript inside your html makes things harder to read.
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[13:10:43] <taplar> your mixing your C in with your V yo
[13:11:23] <marcus1060> Hi there, is $(document).on(cordova.admob.onAdLoaded, function() {}); not the same as document.addEventListener(admob.events.onAdLoaded, function() {});? Because the jQuery version is not working.
[13:11:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:11:50] <robertmaxrees> they're not the same.
[13:12:00] <robertmaxrees> the event name is different in those examples/
[13:12:17] <lyhr> i am using $(".someclass").parent().append(' <a href="#" id="phone" onclick="showHide('numbers');return false;">More numbers...</a>');  and having the single quote in there i thing is breaking that statement
[13:12:27] <robertmaxrees> lyhr don't use that.
[13:12:31] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated event listener.
[13:13:10] <marcus1060> Ah yeah, ignore that, they are the same in the code.
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> is that supposed to be a string?
[13:14:03] * lyhr is looking into using a delegated event listener
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events lyhr
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> and please make sure you actually read all of that - it seems like a lot but it'll change how you approach event listeners.
[13:14:42] <marcus1060> It's a var that contains a string
[13:14:48] <lyhr> TY reading into that now
[13:15:20] <robertmaxrees> marcus1060 no idea then.  there are some differences between jquery and native event handlers so maybe that's the issue?  i doubt it though.
[13:18:17] <taplar> lyhr: on, there's another issue with your logic which was kinda missed.  looks like in your code snipplet your reusing ids.  that's not valid
[13:18:48] <robertmaxrees> potentially.
[13:18:57] <taplar> unless i'm just reading that wrong
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> *potentially reusing ids.
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> they were comparing two snippets, neither of which are a good idea :)
[13:20:24] <lyhr> taplar: the code works but breaks when i am inserting into another page using the append function.  i only included enough from the code to ask about the single vs double quotes. i could post all of the code if interested
[13:20:38] <taplar> nah, i was just being an idiot
[13:21:23] <taplar> not uncommon
[13:21:41] <lyhr> humans are idiots so u were just being human
[13:21:55] * taplar thinks he made a friend
[13:21:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:24:36] <marcus1060> Oh, the issue is namespaces in on. Is there anyway to disable the use of namespaces?
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> you mean event namespaces?
[13:25:30] <marcus1060> Yes,
[13:26:01] <marcus1060> The event I'm trying to use is "appfeel.cordova.admob.onAdLoaded", but jquery is trying to turn it into namespaces
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> oh that, yeah.
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of - you might need to escape the periods?
[13:26:45] <Pazician> How can I target the right one, I thought I could use data-attributes for this, this is how my code looks like http://pastebin.com/warning.php?p=1 Also, I should maybe mention that I'm working with Google API and what I want is when a user clicks a flag the marker dialog should show up for that specific country
[13:27:02] <robertmaxrees> Pazician wrong link.
[13:28:27] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I guess you want a jsfiddle, right?
[13:28:35] <robertmaxrees> Pazician when DON'T I ;)
[13:28:46] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Hehe, here you go: https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/1/
[13:35:44] <taplar> so is your question about ln 59-61?
[13:36:33] <Pazician> taplar: Yep, correct
[13:36:39] <taplar> for one thing your calling that function from inside a for each
[13:36:48] <taplar> so that binding is going to happen multiple times
[13:37:18] <Pazician> taplar: Right, I just moved it outside now
[13:38:04] <Pazician> So what it currently does, it triggers all the dialogs at once - I want the specific one only to show
[13:38:21] <taplar> what's your updated fiddle?
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> who changes a fiddle and then doesn't share the update?
[13:38:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:38:44] <taplar> Paz
[13:38:45] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/2/
[13:38:47] <taplar> :)
[13:39:09] <Pazician> I literally just moved the click event outside the loop
[13:39:15] <taplar> ok, so now your issue is the marker will be undefined
[13:39:28] <robertmaxrees> Pazician still very relevant because of side effects that can happen.
[13:39:34] <taplar> so what you could do is put that marker on the div as a data element
[13:39:53] <taplar> and then use it in your click handler
[13:40:22] <taplar> you'll need to find which one to put it on though
[13:42:15] <Pazician> Well, this is how my HTML looks like https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/3/
[13:42:41] <taplar> does the class always match the data element?
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> *attribute.
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> not element ;)
[13:42:55] <taplar> sorry
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> (i'ma be that guy today apparently :( )
[13:43:10] <taplar> lol
[13:43:12] <Pazician> Lol
[13:43:14] <taplar> it's fine
[13:43:48] <Pazician> I don't understand the part where the data attributes come in, when the specific one should show up
[13:44:06] <taplar> so you need to know what marker goes with which div
[13:44:16] <taplar> by attaching the marker to the div, that lets you know
[13:44:22] <taplar> and you don't have to look it up later
[13:44:25] <taplar> you just access it
[13:44:49] <Pazician> Right, so in the practical way how should it look like - I'm all green on this part
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:45:08] <robertmaxrees> what part specifically are you lost on with that?
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> instead of asking for an example, let's see if we can't guide you :)
[13:45:28] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I don't understand how the data attribute should be written
[13:45:44] <taplar> just think of a data attribute as a variable on the dom element
[13:45:44] <Pazician> The function, more likely
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery data attributes
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> dammit b-ot
[13:46:05] <taplar> :)
[13:46:39] <jquery116> i'm using jQuery.getJSON, in the .done function(data) .. data is an object with members returned in this order: 3=>item_object, 6=>item_object, 1=>item_object. I then use jQuery.each(data, function(i, item) .. the problem is the each reorders the object members, ordering by the number of it's name. i don't want that. I want them to come out in the order they are in the object.. any way I can acommplish this?
[13:47:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery116 is it an array?
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> or an object?
[13:47:10] <jquery116> object
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> can you actually show an example of the object?
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> because your representation doesn't make sense.
[13:47:51] <jquery116> i just did.. it's an object.. who's members are each an item object.. the members names are numerical
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> JSON/javascript.
[13:48:23] <jquery116> {"7":{"id":"7","name":"Sales & Discounts","description":"One or two notifications monthly, featuring recently discontinued, or clearance items, special sale items, and even site-wide promos! This one you do NOT want to miss out on!","entered":"2015-10-23 15:45:23","listorder":"0","prefix":"","rssfeed":null,"modified":"2015-10-29 14:49:07","active":"0","owner":"1","category":""},"8":{"id":"8","name":"Newsletter","description":"Our mo
[13:48:32] <Pazician> Ouh
[13:48:36] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you're SOL.
[13:48:41] <robertmaxrees> objects don't have an inherent order.
[13:48:49] <robertmaxrees> in javascript, you cannot rely on them.
[13:49:09] <jquery116> what if i created an array of the order I want.
[13:49:16] <robertmaxrees> arrays, however, DO have a guaranteed order.
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> so that would work.
[13:49:21] <jquery116> and loops thru that.. each time picking out the member object i want.
[13:49:37] <taplar> you'd just iterate
[13:49:38] <robertmaxrees> then you can just use native forEach()
[13:49:45] <jquery116> yeah but it comes back as an object..
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> if order is important, you need an array.
[13:49:57] <jquery116> the order is a hard coded constant for the entire app.
[13:50:18] <jquery116> so I can just make an array loop thru it in the correct order picking out the correct object member each time.. think that would do it.
[13:50:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack - if order is important, your backend should output an array.
[13:50:46] <taplar> if you make it an array, and order the array in the correct/intended order, then you don't have to 'pick' them out.  you would just iterate over them
[13:50:48] <robertmaxrees> because that's the datatype you want in the frontend.
[13:51:07] <jquery116> it's php outputing an associative array in the back end.
[13:51:16] <jquery116> which ends up being an object when you convert it to json.
[13:51:20] <robertmaxrees> right - so fix that you put out a plain javascript array.
[13:51:43] <jquery116> you mean manually output the json.
[13:51:49] <taplar> no, just take off the keys
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> ^ i don't know php but this sounds right.
[13:52:04] <robertmaxrees> remove those keys so you get an array.
[13:52:40] <taplar> your doing something like $myarray( "key" => value )
[13:52:49] <taplar> just do array_push($myarray, value)
[13:53:28] <Pazician> Would it work if I would set a class on the JSON description, like wrap it all around and then user the data-attr to find the specific one?
[13:54:47] <taplar> i still had the question from earlier if your class always matched your data-flag value
[13:55:01] <taplar> cause if you had that on the response you could look up the element by class
[13:56:06] <taplar> but yeah you need something on the message that lets you know how to find the related div
[13:56:26] <Pazician> Oh, well that was the thing I came up with now - sorry I didn't understand you before... How can I write that in my current code?
[13:56:55] <taplar> is there something on the message already that matches those classes?
[13:57:28] <Pazician> Yes, there's a "wrapper" that has the class as the data-flag has
[13:57:31] <Pazician> So it should match
[13:58:08] <taplar> ok, so use that wrapper to look up the div
[13:58:46] <Pazician> Right, but the thing is that I've no idea how to get it done with the code I currently got
[13:59:06] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/3/
[13:59:27] <taplar> yeah, so how do you access the wrapper variable?
[13:59:48] <Pazician> It displays as it fetches the data from the JSON file
[14:00:06] <Pazician> Oh, it's not a variable tho it's just an class
[14:00:06] <taplar> no, i mean, the variable
[14:00:15] <Pazician> Which variable?
[14:00:52] <taplar> so i'll ask again.  does the message your getting back from json already have something on it that directly matches the class/data-flag of the elements?
[14:00:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:02:27] <Pazician> You guys gotta think I'm retarded or something, honestly... Well, I've a wrapper around the description or the data that fetches in the dialog, which has the same class of the name that the data-flag has - are you following?
[14:02:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> not an ok word.
[14:02:45] <Pazician> What's that?
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> "retarded"
[14:02:59] <Pazician> Oh, sorry...
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> Kind of derogatory ;)
[14:03:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, you should really show us.
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> describing code/data isn't very helpful.
[14:03:46] <Pazician> Right, what do you wanna see?
[14:03:54] <robertmaxrees> anything/everything that is relevant.
[14:04:01] <taplar> an example of the response would be helpful
[14:04:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're about to describe the response, for instance, show us what that looks like.
[14:04:22] <robertmaxrees> any time you find yourself describing code/data, just show us an example.
[14:04:43] <Pazician> Well, hmmm... Are you guys willing to join a join.me conversation for live demo?
[14:04:48] <Pazician> Since it's local
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> just show the data.
[14:04:53] <taplar> in this context, a single example of a 'city' would be fine
[14:05:00] <jquery116> yeah problem is.. and just trust me on this.. the app needs the keys.
[14:05:02] <robertmaxrees> no need for a demo.
[14:05:09] <jquery116> the keys are the ids
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery116 the backend does, right?
[14:05:12] <robertmaxrees> not the frontend.
[14:05:28] <robertmaxrees> if the frontend ALSO needs them, then you need to have an "ID" field in the object.
[14:05:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery116 we can't change the way the language functions - objects have no inherent order.
[14:06:07] <taplar> you didn't learn that power robert?  psssha
[14:06:09] <jquery116> well in this real world.. i'm time constrained. I'm going to have to hack it. put in a comment to fix it next time I get time to refractor
[14:06:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:06:24] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude, duder
[14:06:29] <Pazician> Well, let me just examplain - what happens now when I click on one of the flags, every dialog that's available gets triggered - which I don't want. If flag called swe is triggered then the specific dialog should show up just for that country, are you guys following?
[14:06:35] <jquery116> really. If i changed the output array i'd have to change all sorts of other stuff
[14:06:36] <robertmaxrees> Pazician we aren't following.
[14:06:49] <jquery116> there are things in the front end that use that id as well.
[14:06:50] <robertmaxrees> show us code/data.
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery116 should be a relatively quick change, but ok.
[14:07:10] <jquery116> yeah not that bad.
[14:07:15] <jquery116> but i have a whole bunch of stuff that needs to be done asap.
[14:07:20] <jquery116> have to hack it.
[14:07:27] <taplar> ok, alternative
[14:07:38] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/4/
[14:07:45] <jquery116> in fact i better get doing and continue working
[14:07:50] <taplar> keep it as an object, but put an extra key value pair on it with the value being an array of the needed ordering
[14:07:51] <jquery116> thanks for the help
[14:07:54] <Pazician> Line 63, triggers every dialog
[14:08:00] <taplar> little duplication, but whatevs
[14:08:00] <jquery116> yeah i could do that..
[14:08:09] <jquery116> add an extra array inside the object.
[14:09:45] <Pazician> Are you guys following here, or are you guys finding this all confusing?
[14:09:54] <taplar> i don't see an example of the data
[14:11:34] <taplar> change line 38 to be console.log(JSON.encode(city)); and put one of those print outs into the fiddle
[14:11:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:12:04] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:12:30] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you seem to struggle with basic troubleshooting and fiddles and things.  i feel like your questions are really broad.
[14:13:02] <Pazician> Of course you think that, you're like God to these things
[14:13:13] <robertmaxrees> nah, not god.  i just notice a pattern.
[14:13:35] <Pazician> Right, I don't get this basic simple things...
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> right - have you read http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 ?
[14:13:58] <taplar> repetition and history are big things.  you just learn over time
[14:14:06] <Pazician> Like, how hard should it be to get the specific data-attr to match another
[14:14:18] <taplar> we don't know
[14:14:24] <taplar> which is why we're asking for more information
[14:14:48] <taplar> the lookup is easy
[14:14:52] <taplar> but only if you have the data
[14:15:11] <Pazician> Don't you know how to say like "If this data-attr matches this, then target that one - otherwise keep looking"
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> selecting elements via data attributes is a Bad Idea™.
[14:15:41] <taplar> "If this data-attr matches this"  i'm trying to find out if you have 'this' already available to use or not
[14:17:16] <Pazician> What's "this" then?
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:17:23] <taplar> lol
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> we don't know.
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> that's literally what taplar is trying to figure out.
[14:17:43] <Pazician> I know "this" = the current element, but I've no idea how should I know that?
[14:17:48] <Pazician> It's not targetted
[14:17:58] <robertmaxrees> is this in relation to a click event?
[14:18:06] <Pazician> I want just to find the class that has the same name as the data-attr
[14:18:11] <Pazician> Yes
[14:18:23] <Pazician> It's in a relation to a click event
[14:18:31] <robertmaxrees> then you have a literal 'this' object.
[14:19:01] <robertmaxrees> var classToSelect = $(this).data('somename'), $theElementYouWant = $('.' + classToSelect);
[14:19:26] <taplar> they all match though so i'm not sure what that's going to do
[14:19:32] <taplar> err, why do that
[14:19:55] <robertmaxrees> i thought the data attribute value of the clicked element matched the class of the thing we're trying to select.
[14:20:20] <taplar> from the markup he has given the data-flag and class of a given element match
[14:20:24] <taplar> they are not shared
[14:20:33] <Pazician> "if data-attr matches with the class, trigger and show that element or in this scenario the dialog, if it's not matching well don't do anything and do not trigger all of the dialogs"
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> Pazician repeating your description hasn't helped so far :)_
[14:20:58] <taplar> your missing a part.
[14:21:09] <taplar> we're trying to find the element, related to the json response
[14:21:24] <taplar> or i thought that's what we were doing
[14:21:47] <robertmaxrees> Pazician taplar and I are both confused about what the problem is - that's why a functioning, paired-down fiddle is really helpful.
[14:21:55] <Pazician> Are you guys thinking about the element that has the class same as the flag has?
[14:22:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:22:03] <taplar> no
[14:22:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> so lost
[14:22:11] <Pazician> Ugh...
[14:22:16] <taplar> your clicking a div
[14:22:25] <taplar> you want to mark the related city on the map
[14:22:27] <taplar> yes?
[14:23:16] <Pazician> Yes
[14:23:17] <Pazician> Correct
[14:23:24] <taplar> so we need to relate a div to a city
[14:23:28] <Pazician> So when the div-flag element is clicked then show the city dialog
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> so what ties that div to the map marker?
[14:23:36] <taplar> in the case of the google map, to a city marker
[14:25:11] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What ties, is the same name?
[14:25:19] <taplar> how do you know that?
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> Pazician answering a question with a vague question isn't helpful.
[14:25:30] <Pazician> Bcuz, I've set a class
[14:25:42] <taplar> that has nothing to do with the json respone
[14:25:44] <taplar> response
[14:25:55] <taplar> what about the city object or marker object relate to a div?
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> the div needs something (like a data attribute) that then helps it relate to the map marker.
[14:27:12] <Pazician> So both of them need a data-attr?
[14:27:18] <Pazician> I'm seriously not following here
[14:27:28] <robertmaxrees> we're asking you questions.
[14:27:31] * taplar tags robertmaxrees 
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> specific questions.
[14:28:02] <robertmaxrees> the div needs something (like a data attribute) that then ties it to the correct map marker.
[14:28:16] <Pazician> Right, and I've done that
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> with what?
[14:28:29] <Pazician> With setting the same class name and the data-attr
[14:28:47] <robertmaxrees> so the div's data attribute matches the class on the map marker?
[14:29:05] <Pazician> From JSON file: "title": "<div class='swe'>
[14:29:18] <Pazician> Yes, it matches the data-attr name
[14:29:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:29:43] <Pazician> You asked me a question that I answered
[14:29:51] <robertmaxrees> the answer does not match the question.
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:31:30] <Pazician> This is from my JSON file: "title": "<div class='swe'><h3>Stockholm</h3>", and the data-attr in the HTML has a data-attr name that's called "swe" same as the div class
[14:31:58] <Pazician> Are you guys following?
[14:34:54] <taplar> so city.title is like "<div class='swe'><h3>Stockholm</h3>"?
[14:37:52] <Pazician> Right
[14:37:59] <taplar> yay!
[14:38:17] <taplar> alright, pop this some where in your function
[14:38:36] <taplar> console.log($(city.title).prop('class'));
[14:40:17] <Pazician> I just get this: Uncaught ReferenceError: infowindow is not defined
[14:40:28] <Pazician> Since it's outside I guess
[14:40:37] <taplar> comment out the line related to ln 64
[14:40:38] <taplar> for now
[14:41:10] <Pazician> City doesn't get defined either
[14:41:26] <taplar> city is undefined on line 38?
[14:41:43] <taplar> that log needs to be in geoCity()
[14:42:03] <Pazician> Oh, you mean I should pass in the console.log inside the geoCode function?
[14:42:22] <taplar> execute it in geoCode(), yes
[14:44:48] <Pazician> I get "swe" in console
[14:44:52] <taplar> :)
[14:45:17] <taplar> so now, you have a way to get the class associated with a city
[14:45:25] <taplar> which also just so happens to be a class on your div
[14:45:46] <taplar> what can you do with that?
[14:46:26] <Pazician> Match it right?
[14:46:32] <taplar> yup
[14:46:59] <taplar> and once you have found your div, you can attach the infowindow and marker on it for later use in the event handler
[14:47:24] <Pazician> Hmm...
[14:47:26] <Pazician> Hold on
[14:47:30] <Pazician> How do I match it?
[14:47:40] <taplar> how do you lookup an element by class?
[14:47:51] <Pazician> if statement?
[14:48:09] <taplar> are you familiar with $(selector)?
[14:48:36] <Pazician> Not really
[14:49:17] <taplar> you needs to do some readin, :)  http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[14:49:42] <Pazician> Yeah, I got that
[14:49:53] <Pazician> I know about the selectors, like $(this) and all that
[14:50:00] <taplar> that's not a selector
[14:50:27] <Pazician> Well, what's that?
[14:50:31] <martixy> In jQ-UI, how can I tell if any dialog is open?
[14:50:33] <taplar> that's just a conversion
[14:50:49] <taplar> $('#id') or $('.class') are selectors
[14:50:59] <Pazician> Oh, right
[14:51:03] <taplar> or other forms of actual dom lookups
[14:52:32] <Pazician> How do I match the class, I can't use hasClass() right?
[14:52:37] <Pazician> That's not right I guess
[14:52:52] <taplar> i kinda just told you a couple of lines back
[14:53:21] <Pazician> I don't understand, I'm so lost man
[14:53:29] <taplar> $('#id') or $('.class') are selectors
[14:54:30] <taplar> martixy: you could probably check if it is visible.  otherwise, there should be an open event you can do stuff in
[14:54:35] <Pazician> It's not just one selector
[14:54:40] <taplar> nope
[14:54:58] <Pazician> So I guess it would be wrong if I did like 10 of these...
[14:55:04] <taplar> yep
[14:55:17] <Pazician> So how can I get to use of the data-attr?
[14:55:28] <taplar> forget the data-attr.  we're after class
[14:55:57] <Pazician> Alright, so $("swe, fin...")?
[14:56:09] <taplar> nope, we want just the one related to our current city
[14:56:18] <Pazician> $(this)?
[14:56:18] <taplar> and don't forget the '.' in front of your classes
[14:56:22] <Pazician> right
[14:57:09] <Pazician> I've no idea, is targetting every class the right way?
[14:57:21] <Pazician> Like I did above?
[14:57:22] <taplar> have you ever did any string concatenation in javascript yet?
[14:57:37] <Pazician> Maybe I've just that I don't know the name of it
[14:58:05] <taplar> like var x = 'me'; x = x + " and you";  would result in x being "me and you"
[14:58:18] <Pazician> Yeah, I've done that
[14:58:22] <taplar> ok
[14:58:30] <Pazician> Like on line: 51?
[14:58:44] <taplar> so, we know that to lookup a class in jquery we use a selector following the pattern of '.classname'
[14:59:04] <taplar> in our case, our classname is coming from our city.title line
[14:59:15] <taplar> which i had you console earlier
[14:59:34] <taplar> so you have your classname, and we know the syntax, so...
[15:00:12] <Pazician> So, what's the next step?
[15:00:21] <taplar> indeed.  ?
[15:01:03] <Pazician> Should I go bby targetting each class, like I showed above, like using the +?
[15:01:18] <taplar> the one you did above you were doing multiple at once
[15:01:18] <Pazician> I don't understand... Sorry
[15:01:24] <taplar> we just want the current one
[15:01:28] <taplar> each time
[15:01:41] <Pazician> Right, how do I do that?
[15:01:49] <taplar> construct your selector
[15:01:59] <Pazician> Can I use the data-attr for these things?
[15:02:03] <taplar> no
[15:02:19] <Pazician> Alright, so hmm...
[15:03:00] <Pazician> Man, honestly I don't know
[15:03:46] <taplar> we got $(city.title).prop('class') from earlier giving us our class, such as 'swe'
[15:03:46] <Pazician> Oh, I think I got it
[15:03:53] <taplar> yeah?
[15:04:15] <Pazician> Like this? $('.' + $(this).data('flag')).on('click', function() {
[15:04:23] <taplar> no
[15:04:25] <taplar> 'ish
[15:04:39] <taplar> atleast your concatenating a selector now, heh
[15:04:56] <taplar>  but no, we're still in geoCode()
[15:05:12] <Pazician> Hmm... Alright, then I don't know
[15:05:30] <Pazician> Oh, maybe I should use $(city.title)?
[15:05:40] <taplar> $(city.title).prop('class') gives you 'swe'
[15:05:40] <Pazician> But, doesn't that give all the classes?
[15:05:49] <taplar> or whatever the class is on that current city
[15:06:13] <taplar> so we need to use string concatentation to build a selector to find the div on the page with that class
[15:07:06] <Pazician> Which strings do we need to concatentinate?
[15:07:17] <taplar> you need to build the '.classname' pattern
[15:07:47] <Pazician> But how are we able to get the specific one?
[15:08:07] <taplar> your getting it off of the city.title like i've shown above
[15:08:52] <Pazician> Like this? $(city.title).prop('class').on('click', function() {
[15:08:57] <taplar> forget the binding
[15:08:59] <taplar> for now
[15:09:03] <taplar> we're not there yet
[15:09:19] <taplar> we need to get the div to attach the infowindow and marker to it
[15:09:33] <taplar> small steps
[15:09:37] <Pazician> Right
[15:10:07] <Pazician> So basically, I don't need the data-attr?
[15:10:11] <taplar> nope
[15:10:16] <taplar> lol
[15:10:48] <Pazician> It's funny ha
[15:11:00] <Pazician> Alright, so...
[15:11:05] <Pazician> What's the next step here
[15:11:12] <taplar> build your selector
[15:11:44] <Pazician> So what's my selector, like this? $(".flags div") and then maybe find the city.title?
[15:13:59] <taplar> '.swe'
[15:14:07] <taplar> or '.no'
[15:14:11] <taplar> or '.fin'
[15:14:32] <taplar> those are the classnames, no?
[15:15:04] <Pazician> Can't I use the data-attr for these things? So everytime I add a new one I need to add the class name to these right?
[15:15:18] <taplar> your classname would need to match
[15:15:28] <taplar> but look ups with a class are faster
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> FAR faster.
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> and they're meant for selecting - data attributes are not.
[15:16:32] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/5/ - This is now showing all the dialogs
[15:16:58] <taplar> your binding in your function again...
[15:17:40] <robertmaxrees> basically, your marker.addListener('click', function() { and $(".swe").on('click', function() { cannot be inside of geoCode
[15:18:43] <Pazician> Well then I get unidentified things going on
[15:20:14] <robertmaxrees> right, so then we fix those.  your entire approach is basically off ;)
[15:22:06] <taplar> we're working up to fixing your event binding.  you could comment it out for now
[15:23:09] <Pazician> So I should comment out from line 62 to 64?
[15:23:33] <taplar> yup, for now
[15:24:02] <Pazician> And what should I do instead?
[15:24:23] <taplar> continue on with constructing your selector
[15:24:34] <taplar> we need to select the div associated with our city
[15:24:54] <robertmaxrees> Pazician are you aware with what the underlying problem is?  why taplar is having you do that?
[15:25:37] <Pazician> I'm really lost I don't understand - honestly, I've been trying this shit all day, like over 10+ hours now...
[15:25:58] <robertmaxrees> so that's the first half of your problem, but the issue is you're binding event listeners inside of a loop
[15:26:07] <taplar> sounds like break time, heh
[15:26:07] <Pazician> The first thing was the Google API markers, that didn't workout with the JSON thing, and etc...
[15:26:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd step away for a little bit.
[15:26:28] <Pazician> taplar: Yeah, but I gotta get this done
[15:26:31] <taplar> temporary burnout can really exaserbate a problem
[15:26:35] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> like, it's only going to take you longer.  take a break.
[15:27:02] <Pazician> Let me try to understand this, so I can go to bed...
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> you're not able to see the forest amongst the trees.
[15:27:26] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Deep, thanks for that
[15:27:43] <robertmaxrees> Pazician if you don't understand why it's broken, trying to understand how to fix it doesn't really make sense.
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:28:19] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[15:28:31] <Pazician> There's a way
[15:28:47] <Pazician> I know that, but I just have a hard time to understand
[15:29:15] <taplar> sure, but it's more benificial if we lead you to the solution rather than just giving it to you
[15:29:39] <taplar> and lack of sleep can really keep you from picking up on things
[15:30:10] <taplar> or just some time away to decompress
[15:31:30] <taplar> can't tell you how many time's i've been working a problem, and being frustrated with it, and then on the drive home going, "....son of a b****"
[15:31:42] <Pazician> Hehe
[15:31:53] <taplar> :)
[15:32:21] <Pazician> Basically, do I need to use the $(this)? Sorry for dumb question, but honestly I'm like a child learning how to ride a bike
[15:32:37] <taplar> you will use that in the event handler, but we're not there yet, ;)
[15:32:38] <tkdaj1> does anyone know how to make the datepicker from JQuery UI only open on my button event I've written? I don't want it to pop up when the input field gains foxus
[15:32:39] <tkdaj1> focus
[15:32:59] <Pazician> So, what the before that step?
[15:33:07] <Pazician> What's the step before that*
[15:33:28] <taplar> 1) find the div associated with our city.title's class
[15:33:40] <Pazician> Stop right there
[15:33:50] <Pazician> Hold on, how do I find the RIGHT div
[15:33:57] <taplar> by class
[15:34:02] <Pazician> Using $(this) and find()?
[15:34:04] <taplar> no
[15:34:04] <Pazician> Oh
[15:34:29] <Pazician> Alright, hold on let me take my shirt off, pissing me off
[15:34:54] <Pazician> Alright, I'm ready!
[15:35:18] <Pazician> So, basically, I should do $(".swe, .fin...").?
[15:35:26] <taplar> yes, but one at a time
[15:35:43] <Pazician> Is it right to repeat myself?
[15:35:51] <taplar> what do you mean?
[15:36:08] <Pazician> Do I not repeat myself when I do that way?
[15:36:12] <taplar> nope
[15:36:21] <taplar> within the confines of geoCode() your only doing it once
[15:36:57] <Pazician> This is the part I really don't follow
[15:37:06] <taplar> what's confusing you?
[15:37:34] <Pazician> I get confused on how to get the class. Let me give you an example on how I think you're meaning
[15:37:56] <Pazician> $(".swe").on('click', func... And do we for each one?
[15:38:01] <taplar> nope
[15:38:05] <taplar> that's a binding
[15:38:07] <taplar> forget binding
[15:38:18] <taplar> we're just after the lookup on the front part
[15:38:52] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $(".swe");
[15:39:00] <taplar> where 'swe' is variable
[15:39:50] <Pazician> Alright, I do the variables and what should I do with them, how do I check them?
[15:39:58] <Pazician> Using a if statement?
[15:40:00] <taplar> what do you mean check?
[15:40:21] <Pazician> What should I do then?
[15:40:37] <taplar> once you have your div, put the infowindow and marker variables on it with data()
[15:40:54] <taplar> because you need those later in your event handler
[15:41:04] <ornerymoose> I’m getting a 403 Forbidden message in the Chrome javascript console when loading my page (it’s in a Ruby on Rails 4 Application served on a CentOS server): why would this be? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/62b2127dc54fb7b28d2d
[15:41:05] <Pazician> I removed my data-attr since you told me we don't need them
[15:41:13] <taplar> we're going to be adding some dynamically
[15:41:30] <taplar> you didn't need your original one for lookups
[15:41:45] <Pazician> Like before, I'm all lost on this part
[15:42:01] <Pazician> Can you please do a example?
[15:42:14] <taplar> so you got the div lookup down?
[15:42:38] <Pazician> No, I don't understand how should I lookup?
[15:43:18] <taplar> so this is the lookup
[15:43:19] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $(".swe");
[15:43:24] <taplar> but 'swe' is variable for us
[15:43:37] <taplar> we get that off of the city.title as mentioned before
[15:43:50] <taplar> which we can use string concatenation to build the selector with
[15:44:04] <Pazician> This is my current code: https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/6/
[15:44:36] <taplar> you gots to leave your binding out of your function man
[15:45:14] <Pazician> Like this then? https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/7/
[15:46:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/8/
[15:47:16] <taplar> now, your doing your lookups statically.  we want to use the class from the city.title to do our lookup
[15:47:46] <Pazician> Alright, so I've my variables stored and what should I do with them?
[15:48:02] <taplar> no, your not done.  your doing your lookup wrong
[15:48:40] <Pazician> I guess I'm far away from done
[15:48:42] <Pazician> Lol
[15:49:10] <Pazician> This trigger thing is just the beginning - my client has so much more than this in mind, lol
[15:49:17] <taplar> $(city.title).prop('class') gives you 'swe' or whatever the class is on that guy
[15:49:22] <taplar> and we need '.swe'
[15:49:27] <Pazician> Right
[15:49:31] <taplar> so build that
[15:49:53] <Pazician> Inside the function or outside?
[15:49:57] <taplar> inside
[15:50:07] <Pazician> Alright, got it
[15:50:14] <Pazician> $(city.title).prop('class') after that?
[15:50:27] <taplar> what are you trying?
[15:50:37] <Pazician> Lookup?
[15:50:46] <taplar> how? what command are you doing?
[15:51:01] <Pazician> I literally just copy&pasted this: $(city.title).prop('class')
[15:51:10] <Pazician> Is it wrong?
[15:51:11] <taplar> but it needs a '.' on the front of it
[15:51:46] <Pazician> I'm not following, does the "class" ned a dot before?
[15:51:56] <taplar> a class selector is '.classname'
[15:52:08] <Pazician> Right, so $(city.title).prop('.class')?
[15:52:12] <taplar> no
[15:52:32] <taplar> $(city.title).prop('class') gives you 'swe'
[15:52:41] <Pazician> I guess it's so annoying trying to explain something a dumb ass like me
[15:52:42] <Pazician> Right
[15:52:44] <Pazician> I get that
[15:52:48] <Pazician> If I console.log that
[15:52:52] <taplar> so we need to append a '.' to the start of that string
[15:52:59] <Pazician> OOH
[15:53:01] <Pazician> Maan
[15:53:03] <Pazician> I got you
[15:53:04] <Pazician> Alright
[15:53:05] <taplar> lol
[15:53:14] <Pazician> I'm so slow tonight
[15:53:26] <taplar> ok, for future reference.  was my use of concatenation over append hurting you?
[15:54:01] <Pazician> Like this? $(city.title).html('.').prop('class');
[15:54:15] <taplar> '.'+ thestring
[15:54:19] <Pazician> Right
[15:54:37] <Pazician> Didn't thought about that onoe
[15:55:03] <Pazician> So like this? $(city.title).prop('.' + 'class');
[15:55:32] <taplar_> stupid network.  did i miss anything?
[15:55:39] <Pazician> So like this? $(city.title).prop('.' + 'class');
[15:55:45] <taplar_> no no
[15:55:55] <taplar_> your trying to cram too much together
[15:56:13] <Pazician> So like this? $('.' + city.title).prop('class');
[15:56:29] <taplar_> move the '.'+ outside before it all
[15:56:44] <Pazician> How do you mean?
[15:56:57] <taplar_> '.'+ $(city.title).prop('class');
[15:57:15] <Pazician> Alright, got it
[15:57:19] <taplar_> make sense?
[15:57:22] <Pazician> Yep
[15:57:27] <taplar_> you need some sleep dude, heh
[15:57:56] <Pazician> Yeah, sooner or later - let's finish this up
[15:58:15] <taplar_> so that constructs your selector
[15:58:25] <Pazician> Right
[15:59:00] <taplar_> so now use it to find the div and put it in a variable so we can put some data on it
[16:00:20] <Pazician> Like this? var find = '.' + $(city.title).prop('class').find('.flags div');
[16:00:29] <taplar> $(selector)
[16:01:08] <Pazician> Yeah, it is a selector right?
[16:01:12] <taplar> yep
[16:01:20] <Pazician> So, it's right?
[16:01:28] <Pazician> So far?
[16:01:28] <taplar> not the way you have it
[16:01:35] <taplar> $(selector) is the format
[16:01:47] <Pazician> I don't understand
[16:01:56] <Pazician> We can keep like this allnight, I guess...
[16:02:04] <taplar> '.'+ $(city.title).prop('class')  <-- that's the selector, no?
[16:02:18] <Pazician> Right
[16:02:28] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $(selector);
[16:02:41] <Pazician> Oh, so
[16:02:53] <Pazician> var find = '.' + $(city.title).prop('class').find(variable);
[16:02:54] <Pazician> ?
[16:03:04] <taplar> no, simple substitution
[16:04:12] <Pazician> Like this? var find = '.' + $(city.title).prop('class') + variable;
[16:04:25] <Pazician> Man, I don't understand
[16:04:33] <taplar> i'm not sure how your chaning $() into that concatenation line
[16:04:36] <taplar> *changing
[16:05:11] <taplar> if i said '3' is x and then i said var y = 6 + x, how would you substitution that to make it one statement?
[16:05:33] <Pazician> x + i?
[16:05:40] <taplar> what?! lol
[16:05:44] <taplar> dude your trolling me
[16:05:48] <Pazician> Lol, I'm lost
[16:06:17] <Pazician> Honestly, for real - I don't understand, really
[16:06:23] <taplar> if '3' is x and var y = 6 + x then i could just one line it with var y = 6 + 3; no?
[16:06:43] <Pazician> I guess
[16:06:51] <Pazician> I don't know - I'm not following
[16:06:51] <taplar> ?
[16:07:03] <taplar> i tell you what 'x' is
[16:07:03] <Pazician> Oh
[16:07:06] <taplar> and then i use it
[16:07:08] <Pazician> Yeah, I got it
[16:07:20] <Pazician> I understand that part
[16:07:36] <taplar> so i tell you that '.'+ $(city.title).prop('class') is the 'selector'
[16:07:45] <taplar> and var $divOnPage = $(selector)
[16:07:53] <Pazician> Yeah?
[16:08:01] <taplar> so if you substitute it
[16:08:17] <Pazician> Substitute what?
[16:08:27] <taplar> selector into the divOnPage line
[16:08:53] <Pazician> Yeah, that's what I'm doing var find = '.' + $(city.title).prop('class') + variable; "variable" is the .swe
[16:08:58] <taplar> no, it's not
[16:09:16] <Pazician> Then I don't really understand
[16:09:18] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $('.'+ $(city.title).prop('class'));
[16:09:33] <Pazician> Right
[16:09:39] <Uhkis> you can do it taplat!
[16:09:52] <Uhkis> taplar can do it also!
[16:10:03] <taplar> lol
[16:10:08] <Pazician> taplar: Is this looking right? https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/9/
[16:10:27] <taplar> no
[16:10:34] <Pazician> Ugh...
[16:10:56] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $('.'+ $(city.title).prop('class'));
[16:11:01] <Pazician> Oh
[16:11:02] <taplar> ^ is verbatum one of the things you need
[16:11:25] <Pazician> Like this? var find = $('.' + $(city.title).prop('class'));
[16:11:30] <taplar> verbatum
[16:11:36] <taplar> i may be spelling that wrong
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> verbatim ;)
[16:11:44] <taplar> k
[16:11:45] <robertmaxrees> (because i'm that guy)
[16:11:48] <taplar> lmao
[16:12:01] <Pazician> Does it look right?
[16:12:08] <Pazician> This? var find = $('.' + $(city.title).prop('class'));
[16:12:15] <taplar> no
[16:12:25] <taplar> var $divOnPage = $('.'+ $(city.title).prop('class'));
[16:12:30] <taplar> copy and paste that into the code
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:12:39] <taplar> i never say that but...
[16:12:53] <Pazician> Alright, then what's the next step?
[16:12:55] <taplar> i'm dieing...
[16:13:03] <Pazician> Lol
[16:13:11] <robertmaxrees> Pazician are you actually learning anything through this experience?
[16:13:14] <Uhkis> not dying at least!
[16:13:20] <taplar> fk
[16:13:22] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yes Iam
[16:13:26] <taplar> i hate you guys
[16:13:33] <taplar> lol
[16:13:36] <Uhkis> :-D
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> because this sure looks like you're coding by proxy
[16:14:27] <Pazician> Sure, you're right but I'll study the code after it's done and be sure to understand it - otherwise I'll come here and let you guys explain it for me
[16:14:45] <robertmaxrees> so how much are you going to pay taplar then?
[16:14:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:15:00] <Pazician> Heh
[16:15:03] <Pazician> Good one
[16:15:06] <taplar> shinies?!
[16:15:09] <robertmaxrees> because he's doing your job for you and it's a disservice to you and him.
[16:15:47] <Uhkis> but its fun to watch so its a service for us other people
[16:15:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:15:52] <Pazician> Right, if I would be acting like that we all would be like living in a fancy houses and such
[16:15:56] <taplar> did i say i hate you guys?
[16:16:17] <Uhkis> we love you too taplar :)
[16:16:20] <robertmaxrees> Pazician not just that, the point of the channel is to help you learn.  which isn't happening here.
[16:16:23] * taplar grumbles
[16:16:43] <taplar> gonna make me throw on a linkin park song
[16:17:04] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: You're right, and as always I do really appreciate your help, every single time
[16:17:13] <Uhkis> taplar is clearly learning about patience
[16:17:22] <taplar> oh dude, i got that in spades
[16:17:22] <robertmaxrees> Pazician it's not about appreciation.
[16:17:26] <robertmaxrees> it's about the point of the channel.

[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[16:21:53] <Pazician> My question is where I should pass in the variables I got on line 62 and 63
[16:22:06] <Pazician> Where do I get to use them?
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> taplar ^
[16:22:40] <Pazician> Are you guys really making fun of me?
[16:22:43] <taplar> i'm trying to clock out.  all you guys, ^_^
[16:23:03] <robertmaxrees> Pazician we're not making fun of you.  i'm pointing out that you're not really asking for jquery help.
[16:23:29] <Pazician> What kind of question am I asking then?
[16:23:52] <robertmaxrees> one related to jquery :)
[16:25:33] <Pazician> I got it
[16:25:36] <Pazician> It's working
[16:26:03] * Pazician hive-fiving him self
[16:30:14] <Pazician> Thank you for your time and all the help, I do really appreciate it! How ever this code worked out https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/11/
[16:30:39] <Pazician> I'm done for today guys, thank you again - good night :)
[16:53:06] <madprops> is there a way to find the bottom y of an element without doing calculations?
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:57:16] <madprops> how can i find the height between an element and it's parent element, like top to top
[16:57:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> like, the offset?
[16:58:30] <madprops> yeah
[16:58:50] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[16:58:53] <robertmaxrees> that should help.
[16:59:19] <madprops> what's the difference between offset and position ?
[16:59:28] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain the difference.
[17:00:43] <madprops> oh i get it
[17:13:29] <madprops> $(this).find('.post_content').position().top is not working as expected
[17:13:38] <madprops> it should be giving me like 46
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> and what are you getting instead?
[17:13:52] <madprops> but it appears to be giving me the offset relative to the document
[17:14:00] <madprops> bigger numbers
[17:14:11] <robertmaxrees> it gives you the position relative to the closest offset parent.
[17:14:18] <madprops> i tried it before manually and it worked
[17:14:33] <madprops> which should be it's parent div no?
[17:16:44] <madprops> :_:
[17:19:01] <robertmaxrees> closest offset parents aren't always the first parent container.
[17:19:03] <robertmaxrees> css and all that.
[17:20:02] <FrameFever> can anybody exaplain me who will trigger this function call? http://pastebin.com/FC1WQfq7
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> "who?
[17:20:22] <robertmaxrees> meaning...?
[17:20:35] <FrameFever> I always thought I have to use: $(document).ready(function(){...});
[17:20:48] <robertmaxrees> that's just for document ready.
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> this is using an IIFE.
[17:20:54] <FrameFever> but somehow this code is invoked
[17:21:24] <robertmaxrees> right, it's an IIFE.  even if you took the IIFE off it'd run.
[17:21:36] <FrameFever> IIFE means what?
[17:21:54] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=iife :)
[17:22:16] <robertmaxrees> the (function($) { })(jQuery); “wrapper”
[17:24:13] <FrameFever> robertmaxrees: I use the bootstrap spy plugin in it
[17:24:18] <robertmaxrees> cool?
[17:24:27] <FrameFever> but only when I put this code in: $(document).ready(function(){..
[17:24:37] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what the document ready does?
[17:24:45] <FrameFever> I don't get a javascript error because of the missing spy plugin
[17:25:02] <FrameFever> This is an event triggered by the browser
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> that means you’re not loading things in the proper order.
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> actually jquery’s document ready is a little more complicated than that.
[17:25:23] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that’s the basic gist.
[17:27:00] <FrameFever> robertmaxrees: your right
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> could you tell my wife that? ;)
[17:27:14] <FrameFever> some js files were not correctly ordered in the markup
[17:27:45] <FrameFever> Hey Nancy, Robert was right!
[17:55:59] <acidjazz> well you better get refunds for those orders then FrameFever
[19:26:13] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here using angularjs, or recommend an alternative?
[19:26:22] <jeffreylevesque> just trying to gauge what technology to use
[19:28:35] <robertmaxrees> depends on the project.
[19:29:02] <jaz1z> Question
[19:29:22] <jaz1z> Someone told me to screw learning vanilla js and go straight for framework. Good or bad idea?
[19:29:23] <robertmaxrees> retort
[19:29:29] <robertmaxrees> bad
[19:29:30] <jaz1z> robertmaxrees, haha nice
[19:29:41] <cannap> jeffreylevesque the newest shit is react^^
[19:29:50] <robertmaxrees> but don’t use it if you don’t need to.
[19:30:01] <robertmaxrees> worse than using a good framework is misapplying one.
[19:31:18] <jeffreylevesque> cannap: you like react more than angularjs
[19:31:36] <cannap> i dont know
[19:31:41] <cannap> i still learning react
[19:31:47] <cannap> i cant tell much about for now
[19:32:04] <cannap> i only know this serverside stuff is easy but im to o stupid to setup hotreload
[19:32:05] <robertmaxrees> react solves a different problem than angular fwiw.,
[19:32:46] <cannap> you should read some vs things and pro and cons of each framework
[19:32:52] <robertmaxrees> and when to use each.
[19:32:59] <jeffreylevesque> this is my very ugly js - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/tree/master/src/js
[19:33:12] <jeffreylevesque> i want to make it more elegant, in any reasonable way
[19:33:20] <cannap> jquery code looks always ugly^^
[19:33:21] <robertmaxrees> why are you checking in your dependencies?
[19:33:39] <jeffreylevesque> like jquery libraries?
[19:33:39] <robertmaxrees> this is what npm is for :)
[19:33:57] <cannap> jquery is the lib
[19:34:06] <jeffreylevesque> should i consider angularjs?
[19:34:10] <cannap> jquery is not a framework its more a tool that makes 10 lines to one line
[19:34:11] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn’t./
[19:34:21] <jeffreylevesque> howcome?
[19:34:27] <robertmaxrees> there are better ways to do what angular does.
[19:34:44] <robertmaxrees> react + flux, for instance.
[19:34:54] <jeffreylevesque> this is particularly ugly - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> you need a templating engine.
[19:35:15] <jeffreylevesque> i should be using some kind of templating, and granular functions
[19:35:52] <cannap> test make the hello world examples
[19:35:52] <robertmaxrees> also, any time you’re reusing a value you should save it to a variable.
[19:37:08] <robertmaxrees> also, learn about es5 array methods like every, some, foreach etc.
[19:38:26] <robertmaxrees> and don’t do $('form ' + selector) - prepending elements onto your selectors is counterproductive.
[19:39:25] <jeffreylevesque> i'm watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YJM4zz8jnU

[19:39:59] <robertmaxrees> they both do two different things - angular is a full MV* framework.  react is just the V
[19:40:17] <cannap> when you will use react and flux then use alt for flux
[19:40:20] <cannap> is very easy
[19:40:21] <robertmaxrees> angular values things like 2-way data binding, where react is much more functional.
[21:29:55] <abishek> is there a way to use wild card characters to search for a dom element? $('.somthing-*')
[21:34:09] <jphase> abishek: yes although it's kinda resource heavy... $('[class$="something"]')  = any class that ends with *something, $('[class^="something"]')  = any class that starts with something*, $('[class*="something"]')  = any class that has *something* in it
[21:34:50] <abishek> jphase, thnx
[21:35:17] <jphase> if you're going to do that it's better to get as specific with your selector as you can, so you'd probably want like.... $('#container > div[class$="something"]')
[21:35:24] <jphase> the more specific the better
[23:04:10] <Foxhoundz> Is there a lightweight version of jquery that includes just the cross-platform selector library
[23:04:20] <rcyr> sizzle?
[23:04:24] <Foxhoundz> :O
[23:04:25] <Foxhoundz> of course
[23:04:33] <rcyr> That said...
[23:04:49] <rcyr> If you don't need to support older browsers, the DOM already has that.
[23:04:59] <Foxhoundz> yeah I know
[23:05:03] <Foxhoundz> but I do need to support older browsers
[23:05:05] <Foxhoundz> IE8+
[23:05:36] <Foxhoundz> querySelector() needs a polyfill
[23:15:09] <rcyr> IE8 supports querySelector but unfortunately... is limited to CSS2 selectors and the attribute selectors of CSS3
[23:33:21] <d3m0n> http://demo.kaliumtheme.com/main/masonry-v2/
[23:33:44] <d3m0n> Anyone know what that image loading/transitioning plugin called?
[23:45:56] <neredsenvy> Anyone able to help with: https://gist.github.com/SterlingDuchess/b3700f9cec8e867a5631
[23:46:23] <neredsenvy> I want to add class open to #open-menu when user clicks on a in p under #open-menu
[23:46:48] <neredsenvy> I know how to do it using .parent().parent() but I have been advised not use that since it's performance consuming.
[23:47:45] <arc_> why can't you just select #open-menu, it's a unique identifier
[23:47:54] <arc_> you don't need to traverse the dom
[23:48:34] <arc_> wait what is this click event
[23:49:12] <arc_> just bind the event to .dropdown-toggle
[23:49:44] <arc_> and do $('#open-menu').addClass('open');
[23:51:21] <neredsenvy> arc_, There are multiple #open-menu that would open all of them
[23:51:35] <arc_> that is not valid html
[23:51:37] <neredsenvy> I need it to open parent #open-menu only
[23:51:46] <arc_> you cannot have more than one id that is the same
[23:51:49] <arc_> that is the entire purpose of ids
[23:52:00] <arc_> they must be unique
[23:52:24] <neredsenvy> ok changed to class
[23:52:27] <neredsenvy> does not matter
[23:52:43] <neredsenvy> https://gist.github.com/SterlingDuchess/bc910b069ca986fc17c9
[23:52:45] <neredsenvy> Updated
[23:52:50] <arc_> well, if you must have more than one of those menus, and you must traverse the dom, then use .closest()
[23:53:08] <arc_> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:54:30] <neredsenvy> Wouldn't that be the same as simply calling .parent().parent() : /
[23:55:33] <arc_> performance-wise? probably not, but i don't know. if you're trying to select a non-unique parent element by the element you are clicking on, you have to traverse the dom
[23:55:36] <arc_> there's no way of getting around that
[23:56:12] <arc_> what you can do is assign a unique id to each menu and select that
[23:56:26] <arc_> otherwise, you have to traverse the dom
[23:58:36] <neredsenvy> Will .parse().parse() have to traverse dom two times or ?
[23:59:19] <arc_> i would imagine that closest() would be more efficient than parent().parent() but i'm not an expert in performance
[23:59:35] <arc_> you can test it if you want
