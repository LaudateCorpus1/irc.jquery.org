[00:50:12] <spinningCat-work> hey i have a small question i have for "info" icon on the image. When you do mousenter i wanna show some text. If you do mouse enter in different image, i want to hide pervious story container and show current story container. Any suggestion about that this is what i tried https://jsfiddle.net/bmtjLn1e/42/
[02:19:46] <Cork> spinningCat-work: you mean replace instead of animate or what?
[02:19:58] <Cork> you're already doing what you're asking for
[02:22:03] <spinningCat-work> like first story is shown when you do mouseneter first image then let say you do mouse enter second info icon first story will diseppear and second one will appear
[02:22:38] <spinningCat-work> well
[02:22:41] <spinningCat-work> yeah
[02:22:42] <spinningCat-work> :d
[02:23:16] <Cork> i fail to see the difference from what you have :)
[02:24:00] <spinningCat-work> this is better https://jsfiddle.net/qevfy9n7/
[02:24:29] <spinningCat-work> Cork,  It was early and i was sleepy okay thank you for response
[02:24:48] <Cork> np
[02:26:37] <spinningCat-work> is it possible to mkake this animation from up to bottom?
[02:29:28] <Cork> sure, you want to only animate the height of the element and not the width

[03:15:06] <shangul> Hello. how to use this plugin? https://github.com/AnSavvides/jquery.linky I have included it in my html file but there is no function with name "linky" in $ or $(selector) Thanks for helping.
[03:15:48] <Cork> shangul: it uses $.fn.linky so $().linky()
[03:16:13] <Cork> also it has examples on the readme page
[03:17:56] <shangul> But there is not function as $().linky perhaps I am including it in the wrong way? Here's how I include it: https://notabug.org/bananaphone/vm-irc/src/master/index.html
[03:18:07] <shangul> s/is not/is no/
[03:19:00] <Cork> no that should work
[03:19:10] <Cork> well your html is broken
[03:19:43] <Cork> also i hope you don't try to use jquery in js/app.js
[03:19:50] <Cork> as it won't work
[03:30:41] <spinningCat-work> Cork,  can be width or height
[03:30:47] <spinningCat-work> i need to ask this to client
[03:31:23] <Cork> spinningCat-work: then you need to use .animate
[03:32:02] <spinningCat-work> I see
[03:32:23] <spinningCat-work> performance of jquery animate is good for mobile?
[03:33:01] <Cork> spinningCat-work: it is what hide(number), show(number) and slide* uses
[03:33:28] <Cork> if you want better performance you need to use key-frame, but that also means you can't use dynamic widths
[03:33:43] <Cork> (key-frame can only animate between known sizes)
[03:34:26] <Cork> (and by known sizes means: known without first rendering the object)
[03:35:49] <spinningCat-work> it is prons and cons
[03:36:17] <Cork> its the classic performance vs ease of use
[03:41:11] <shangul> Cork, my html is broken? How can I fix it? moving <script> tags to <head>?
[03:41:37] <spinningCat-work> Thanks Cork
[03:41:44] <Cork> shangul: https://validator.w3.org/
[03:41:58] <spinningCat-work> shangul,  did you check console?
[03:42:10] <shangul> spinningCat-work, Yeah. nothing there
[03:42:35] <Cork> but the error is a missing attribute value quote
[03:42:39] <Cork> might be more
[03:43:00] <Cork> hense why i linked the validator
[03:44:56] <shangul> Thanks. The only problem was what you said however I tried to fix many Warnings, too!
[03:45:15] <Cork> shangul: did you see the question about apps.js?
[03:45:51] <shangul> <Cork> also i hope you don't try to use jquery in js/app.js => This?
[03:46:01] <Cork> yes
[03:46:25] <shangul> I'm using jQuery there and it is working
[03:46:37] <Cork> then app.js include jquery and that is why you get the problem
[03:46:56] <Cork> the plugin and a new set of jquery is loaded at the end of the page
[03:47:14] <Cork> but app.js is called in head so it runs before they are loaded
[03:48:51] <shangul> Cork, What about "defer"?
[03:49:29] <Cork> shangul: isn't really a solution
[03:50:00] <Cork> if you want jquery to work in scriopt loaded in head you need to load it before them
[03:50:10] <Cork> (in head)
[03:51:48] <shangul> aha
[03:51:53] <shangul> I'll try
[03:52:31] <Cork> shangul: also know you can use two version of jquery in a page, and then the plugin will be in the one loaded last before you loaded the plugin
[03:52:50] <Cork> shangul: so i recommend you make very sure you don't load two jquery versions
[03:53:31] <shangul> Thanks for the advice :)
[03:55:30] <Cork> yw
