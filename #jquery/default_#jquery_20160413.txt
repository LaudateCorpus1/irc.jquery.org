[01:48:57] <claytonzaugg> is there a simple approach to adding commas to numbers in the dom?
[01:50:37] <claytonzaugg> I'm returning calculated totals, but they're appearing as 12345 instead of 12,345
[01:59:44] <suexec> claytonzaugg, could you fiddle an example that's not working ?
[02:00:08] <claytonzaugg> Actually, I just discovered numeral.js
[02:00:25] <claytonzaugg> perfect for what I need!  Thanks for checking back suexec
[02:00:33] <suexec> claytonzaugg, cool . Good luck :)
[02:02:18] <suexec> claytonzaugg, you could also use the function provided here, http://www.mredkj.com/javascript/numberFormat.html , if you don't need a framework for further formatting
[02:02:35] <claytonzaugg> Hmm, I'll check that out as well.
[02:02:59] <claytonzaugg> Ah, very cool indeed! Thanks!

[06:25:35] <swensson> Hello guys, im trying to delete 2 values from my mysqli DB with php with a click of a button. Can anyone please assist me?
[06:27:24] <tuskkk___> have three methods, each of them fire an ajax call to the server, how do we detect the collective complete?
[06:56:12] <jonkristian> Do i have to bind sortable on drop to make sortable inside a draggable element work after it has been dragged and dropped? Not really sure how to tackle that, any ideas would be greatly appreciated :)
[06:56:37] <jonkristian> I've found that before drag-and-drop i can sort inside a draggable, but not after.
[06:57:09] <jonkristian> sort inside meaning i have a sortable list inside the element, just for clarity.

[09:09:54] <islalobo> files is value from an input field
[09:10:20] <islalobo> I tried appending in the manner above, but console.log(formData); appears to be empty
[10:42:12] <Fernando-Basso> Why wouldn't $(this).closest('.foo').remove() not work when I am using `on()` to bind the event and the selector does find the element (I see it when I log it).
[10:43:34] <Fernando-Basso> $imageList.on('click', '.preview-wrap .del-no', function (evt) {
[10:43:34] <Fernando-Basso>     $(this).closest('.remove-confirm').remove();
[10:43:34] <Fernando-Basso> });
[10:44:51] <Fernando-Basso> If I log `this` inside that anonymous function it does show the element (although hovering over it on the console does not highlight the element on the page, like if it they were not the same object).
[10:45:26] <Fernando-Basso> I am adding the confirmation box with $jqobj.append("<html str...").
[10:46:19] <Fernando-Basso> Even $(this).remove does not remove the element itself.
[10:46:27] <Fernando-Basso> I mean, $(this).remove()
[10:50:22] <Penorsaurus> https://jsfiddle.net/rosefox911/4zgfyfk0/
[10:50:27] <Penorsaurus> What am I doing wrong here?
[10:50:41] <Penorsaurus> it's always returning the boxc as checked.
[10:53:24] <NoiseEee> Penorsaurus: you ALWAYS get a jquery object back from a selector
[10:53:36] <NoiseEee> Penorsaurus: check it's length to see if it actually has anything you wanted ;)
[10:53:44] <Penorsaurus> ah, I see.
[10:54:16] <Penorsaurus> so if its em pty, then its not checked.
[10:54:49] <NoiseEee> if the length is greater than 0, it's checked.
[10:55:05] <NoiseEee> rather, your selector has found matching elements to be precise
[10:55:29] <Penorsaurus> $('.checkbox').attr('checked',true);
[10:55:33] <Penorsaurus> something like that then
[10:56:06] <NoiseEee> well, that will give mark all .checkboxes with a checked attribute of true
[10:56:18] <NoiseEee> in that case you would use .prop btw
[10:58:42] <Penorsaurus> I just want to determine if the box is checked or not.
[10:59:34] <fischimhaus> Penosaurus, isn't the :checked selector what you are looking for?
[10:59:45] <Penorsaurus> I would assume so.
[10:59:57] <Penorsaurus> so (".drstk-map-story input[type='checkbox']:checked")
[11:00:08] <fischimhaus> yes
[11:00:28] <Penorsaurus> https://jsfiddle.net/rosefox911/4zgfyfk0/1/
[11:00:48] <Penorsaurus> wrong selector
[11:00:59] <Penorsaurus> is there a way to stop jsfiddle from overwriting lines when I type
[11:01:03] <Penorsaurus> mega annoying
[11:01:05] <fischimhaus> with this way you select it.. but if you want if it is checked you could also do a if ( bla.is(':checked') )
[11:01:44] <Penorsaurus> fischimhaus, https://jsfiddle.net/rosefox911/4zgfyfk0/3/
[11:01:46] <Penorsaurus> why is that wrong
[11:02:22] <fischimhaus> because you just get an jquery object by the selection you did
[11:02:28] <fischimhaus> wait a mom pls
[11:02:32] <Penorsaurus> I see.
[11:02:37] <Penorsaurus> so if I did is(:checked)
[11:02:41] <Penorsaurus> then it would return true or false.
[11:03:45] <fischimhaus> I guess you want to get "updated" whenever the box is checked or not?
[11:03:51] <Penorsaurus> No.
[11:03:54] <Penorsaurus> Only once.
[11:04:01] <Penorsaurus> so an on change isn't required.
[11:04:07] <Penorsaurus> on runtime basically, if its checked or not.
[11:06:10] <fischimhaus> https://jsfiddle.net/4zgfyfk0/4/
[11:06:19] <fischimhaus> that's how you approach it
[11:06:47] <Penorsaurus> let me try it
[11:10:27] <Penorsaurus> fischimhaus, thanks that worked
[11:10:33] <fischimhaus> No problem ;)
[11:11:00] <fischimhaus> You can use this method to check for all kind of selectors that you use in the $('...') part
[11:11:21] <Penorsaurus> yeah
[11:11:23] <Penorsaurus> good to know
[11:56:54] <Penorsaurus> fischimhaus, https://jsfiddle.net/rosefox911/3r7k1nf3/2/
[11:56:58] <Penorsaurus> what am I doing wrong here?
[11:57:03] <Penorsaurus> why is it undefined?
[11:57:40] <fischimhaus> you mean the add button?
[11:58:02] <fischimhaus> Penosaurus
[11:58:17] <Penorsaurus> right.
[11:58:33] <Penorsaurus> when I click the add buttom it should produce a console log wi th the values entered.
[11:59:11] <robertmaxrees> <a href="#" type="button" id="submit_custom_item">Add</a>
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not an input.
[11:59:17] <robertmaxrees> that's an <a> tag.
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> woops nvm ignore mne hahaha
[11:59:29] <Penorsaurus> lol\
[11:59:57] <robertmaxrees> wait where is custom_item_image_url ?
[12:00:00] <fischimhaus> Penosaurus, because you have a selector for an id but your elements are input without the id. What you declared as their id is their name-tag
[12:00:03] <fischimhaus> *attribute
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> # is for IDs.
[12:00:30] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[12:00:39] <Penorsaurus> that is why
[12:00:48] <Penorsaurus> lets see
[12:00:53] <fischimhaus> give them an ID or search for their name
[12:00:55] <Penorsaurus> yupe
[12:00:57] <Penorsaurus> that fixed it
[12:01:06] <Penorsaurus> works 100% now
[12:01:07] <Penorsaurus> thanks :)
[12:01:20] <fischimhaus> you are welcome
[12:01:43] <fischimhaus> I am off now, bye /)
[12:02:14] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, what if I wanted to add multiple custom items
[12:02:19] <Penorsaurus> and add t hem to a hash table of sorts.
[12:02:34] <robertmaxrees> there are no "hash tables" in js.
[12:02:37] <Penorsaurus> basically, store multiple custom values in a var, for further use.
[12:02:38] <robertmaxrees> i assume you mean an object.
[12:02:58] <robertmaxrees> and there are a few ways.  any reason you can't use an array?
[12:03:02] <Penorsaurus> so custom_entry 1 has a url, title description, custom_entry 2 has the same.
[12:03:03] <robertmaxrees> because that'd be really easy.
[12:03:22] <Penorsaurus> an array within an array?
[12:03:29] <robertmaxrees> or an array of objects.
[12:03:36] <Penorsaurus> can you show me an example?
[12:03:45] <robertmaxrees> what part are you confused by?
[12:03:57] <Penorsaurus> so an object would have the 3 fields
[12:04:04] <Penorsaurus> and that object would be added an an rray, correct?
[12:04:10] <Penorsaurus> I am confused how I would construct that object.
[12:04:28] <Penorsaurus> var box = {}; // my object
[12:04:28] <Penorsaurus> var boxes =  []; // my array
[12:04:29] <Penorsaurus> like so?
[12:04:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:04:38] <Penorsaurus> ok.
[12:04:49] <robertmaxrees> or you could do an array of arrays.
[12:05:02] <robertmaxrees> and then .find('input').map().get()
[12:05:40] <Penorsaurus> i'll try the object thing first.
[12:07:02] <GrundeLL> Hello
[12:07:43] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/rosefox911/3r7k1nf3/3/
[12:07:45] <Penorsaurus> works fine :)
[12:08:21] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing var custom_item_description = $("#custom_item_description").val(); before the hanlder?
[12:08:34] <Penorsaurus> mmm
[12:08:38] <Penorsaurus> I guess I don't need to.
[12:08:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:35:08] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, how would I extract the objects from the array now?
[12:35:12] <Penorsaurus> using each()?
[12:54:17] <taplar> Penorsaurus: https://jsfiddle.net/3r7k1nf3/4/    what's the question?
[12:55:53] <Penorsaurus> taplar, I got it :)
[12:55:54] <Penorsaurus> thanks
[12:55:59] <Penorsaurus> ZI used anm each

[13:41:44] <jez9999> Hi guys; I have some code whose "live" event handler is not working.  Please could you check it to see what I've done wrong?  Yes, I know 'live' is deprecated but I'm using an old version of jQuery so please humour me.  Code: http://pastebin.com/KmB1hAVq
[13:43:03] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[13:43:23] <robertmaxrees> and what happens when you place a console.log('foo') as the first line of the handler?
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> jez9999
[13:49:02] <jez9999> 1.6.1
[13:49:18] <robertmaxrees> and what happens when you place a console.log('foo') as the first line of the handler?
[13:49:47] <jez9999> well when i break inside it, it doesn't break
[13:49:50] <jez9999> so it isn't calling it
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> okay.  that means you're either not binding, or the code is never running.
[13:50:09] <jez9999> it is running
[13:50:16] <jez9999> it breaks on the removeClass line
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> "well when i break inside it, it doesn't break"
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly at odds with what you just said.
[13:50:34] <jez9999> yes
[13:50:39] <jez9999> i mean inside the live callback
[13:50:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> it runs but it doesn't?
[13:51:06] <jez9999> it doesnt break inside the live callback for mouseover..., but it does inside the click one
[13:51:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah. jQuery(menuEntry).live('mouseover mouseout', function(ev){ THIS isn't working.
[13:51:33] <jez9999> yep
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> fwiw why are you binding inside of a binding?
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of a bad thing to do.
[13:51:52] <jez9999> because the elemenmt gets created on click
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> then why use .live() at all?
[13:52:34] <jez9999> for the mouseover... you mean?
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:52:51] <jez9999> yeah i could just use .mouseover or something
[13:52:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:53:03] <robertmaxrees> just move the binding outside of the parent .live() call.
[13:53:22] <robertmaxrees> binding inside of other bindings is a bad idea.
[13:53:24] <jez9999> but the element gets created on click
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> .live() creates a delegated listener.
[13:53:37] <jez9999> yeah
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't matter when the element gets created.
[13:53:51] <robertmaxrees> that's why you used to use live vs. bind
[13:53:59] <jez9999> but to bind to this specific div, i need to bind AFTER it's been created
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> you're not binding TO the div.
[13:54:12] <robertmaxrees> you're binding to the document.
[13:54:23] <jez9999> back up a second
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> nothing in jQuery(menuEntry).live('mouseover mouseout', function(ev){ relies on anything happening before it.
[13:54:52] <jez9999> so i want to bind to the element that gets created when another element gets clicked
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:55:21] <robertmaxrees> just pass that inner live a selector that matches the element you care about.
[13:55:24] <jez9999> because that's the element i need to do stuff on
[13:55:38] <robertmaxrees> >.> but you don't need to do that inside of the first live call.
[13:55:39] <jez9999> the element doesnt have anything useful to select on
[13:55:44] <jez9999> thats why im checking innerText
[13:55:45] <robertmaxrees> then give it a class.
[13:55:52] <jez9999> i cant, it's not my code doing the rendering!
[13:55:57] <jez9999> (yes the rendering is crap)
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:56:11] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle then?
[13:56:17] <robertmaxrees> because something here isn't adding up.
[13:57:22] <jez9999> im saying "when this menu button is clicked, match a container with class X.  search that container for a DIV with this text, and attach these event handlers to that DIV"
[13:57:36] <robertmaxrees> except you're not attaching the handlers to that div at all.
[13:57:42] <jez9999> i can't match the container before the click because it is created after the click
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> then check within the mouseenter mouseout listener if your element matches particular criteria.
[13:58:18] <jez9999> i thought $element.live() bound to the $element
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> becuase what you're doing now will stack bindings over and over.
[13:58:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:58:25] <jez9999> what does it do then
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> it creates a delegated listener.
[13:58:54] <Side_FX> Why would I get "TypeError: 'append' called on an object that does not implement interface FormData" in  code: http://pastebin.com/1GcDrGYx
[13:59:49] <jez9999> robertmaxrees: you mean in every call to the live callbacks, check every DIV's innerText?  seems inefficient
[13:59:58] <jez9999> wouldn't it be better to do that just once, on the initial click?
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> no reason to.
[14:00:13] <jez9999> well what criteria can i use?
[14:00:18] <jez9999> to match the desired div?
[14:00:22] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your markup looks like.
[14:00:28] <jez9999> <div>some text</div>
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> hence the request for a fiddle.
[14:00:49] <robertmaxrees> i highly doubt you just have a div stuck as a child of body.
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a hierarchy you can select on.
[14:01:06] <jez9999> the point is, the div i want to match has nothing but text
[14:01:16] <jez9999> so how do i match THAT div
[14:01:36] <robertmaxrees> Side_FX no idea.  i'd have to see it break.
[14:01:37] <jez9999> (hint: it's innerText)
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> jez9999 through a parent element.
[14:01:54] <robertmaxrees> again, make a fiddle and i can show you.
[14:01:58] <jez9999> the parent element has multiple children
[14:02:07] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* you're giving me nothing to work with.
[14:03:01] <jez9999> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/ha48e6zj/
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what're you trying to accomplish here?
[14:03:27] <jez9999> attach hover events to the About div
[14:03:49] <robertmaxrees> so about is the only one that should trigger the hover event listeners?
[14:04:25] <jez9999> yes
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> because you're using jquery 1.6, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ha48e6zj/1/
[14:09:02] <jez9999> hmm
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> this uses .live() the way it was meant to be used.
[14:09:16] <jez9999> i'm surprised that's more efficient.  jQuery is having to do a CSS match every time
[14:09:24] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not happening there.
[14:10:00] <robertmaxrees> well, it's not happening the way you think it is.
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> and the performance impact is negligible.
[14:10:20] <jez9999> each time any event bubbles doesnt jQuery have to analyze whether the selector matches?
[14:10:28] <taplar> no
[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> very cheap operation.
[14:10:39] <jez9999> ok...
[14:10:45] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing performance problems"?
[14:10:55] <jez9999> guess not
[14:10:59] <robertmaxrees> because premature optimization is the devil.
[14:12:53] <robertmaxrees> any plans to update to a more recent version of jquery?
[14:13:25] <jez9999> oh
[14:13:40] <jez9999> :contains only checks whether it contains the text, not whether it's the full text
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> Right.  there are a few different ways to be more particular about what you want.
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> because you're using 1.6 you're limited in the convenience methods, but there are ways to work with that.
[14:14:56] <jez9999> so any suggestions?
[14:15:15] <jez9999> (it's not my choice as to what ver of jQuery is used sadly, we're working with another company's software)
[14:17:19] <robertmaxrees> wait do you have multiple childen of .main-menu that contain the text "about"?
[14:17:40] <jez9999> potentially
[14:18:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, there are two ways I'd go about your predicament: either use .each() and set a var for the element you want, or change the binding to just be on all those divs and check inside to see if the text matches whatever.

[14:20:21] <bilb_ono> has anyone used soundclouds track seeker? where you slide the track back and forth across the pin as opposed to sliding the pin back and forth
[14:20:40] <bilb_ono> I want to put a slider like that on my website
[14:20:52] <bilb_ono> does anyone know a good jquery timeslider plugin that does that?
[14:21:36] <jez9999> robertmaxrees: my original code is using each() and setting a var...
[14:21:46] <robertmaxrees> jez9999 inside of another event handler.
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't ever bind within another event handler.
[14:22:20] <jez9999> ok so could you give a code example of how it should be done?
[14:22:26] <robertmaxrees> i just did.
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ha48e6zj/3/
[14:22:35] <jez9999> not the "match all divs" way
[14:22:39] <jez9999> the former way you said
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:22:46] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ha48e6zj/3/ ?
[14:23:09] <jez9999> i can but im interested in the first way you said
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> but you've alreayd done it.
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not suyre why you're asking me.
[14:23:30] <jez9999> because it wasnt working?
[14:23:45] <jez9999> i did something wrong, not sure what
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, .live() needs you to use $() with a selector.
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> forgot all about that.
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> can't take an opject.
[14:24:28] <robertmaxrees> *object
[14:25:10] <jez9999> ah
[14:25:13] <jez9999> that explains it
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't determine the object ahead of time, basically.
[14:25:17] <decx> i object!
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> no u
[14:25:38] <jez9999> but i could use static binding for the mouseover/mouseout events
[14:25:47] <robertmaxrees> not if you're dynamically creating the elements.
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> don't create bindings within other bindings.
[14:25:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[14:25:59] <jez9999> how come
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> because you create them multiple times.
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> harder mental overhead, too.
[14:26:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ha48e6zj/3/ is exactly the right way to do it.
[14:26:34] <jez9999> ok guess i'll do that
[14:26:36] <robertmaxrees> given you constraint of 1.6
[14:26:54] <jez9999> so out of interest, how would you do it in the latest jquery
[14:27:33] <robertmaxrees> very similarly.  your html is holding you back a lot.
[14:27:42] <jez9999> no, their html
[14:27:47] <robertmaxrees> you know what i mean.
[14:27:57] <robertmaxrees> "your html" == "the html you're using"/
[14:28:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ha48e6zj/5/
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> this just moves the binding down to $('.main-menu')
[14:28:35] <jez9999> right
[14:28:41] <robertmaxrees> which is better overall.
[14:28:44] <robertmaxrees> imo.
[14:30:17] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[14:49:52] <ohcibi> is there something like `contains` for an exact match?
[14:53:03] <taplar> elaborate?
[17:09:42] <Scriptonaut> I have a jquery object, and I would like to bind to the document and catch an event affecting a child element of my jquery object. Is this possible? So I have like: element = $(".somediv"); and I want to do: $(document).on 'click', element.find(".somechild"), function() { ...
[17:10:02] <Scriptonaut> but I know you can't pass jquery objects when binding on document like that, you just have to pass a selector
[17:14:30] <jphase> Scriptonaut: I'd set the element variable to the selector itself and then create the DOM object by wrapping it in $() personally
[17:14:33] <NoiseEee> why do you think you want to do what you are asking?
[17:14:56] <jphase> then you can pass the selector as the delegated event listener in the second param, and when you need the object you can use $( element )
[17:15:01] <Scriptonaut> I don't have the selector, it's passed into my module
[17:15:14] <Scriptonaut> all I have is the jquery object
[17:15:37] <jphase> hmm, I got nothin' then heh
[17:15:42] <Scriptonaut> ah, thanks anyways
[17:16:05] <NoiseEee> so why don't you just jqueryObject.on('click',function() {}) ?
[17:16:20] <NoiseEee> what makes you think you need to bind it do 'document' ?
[17:16:25] <NoiseEee> s/do/to/
[17:16:25] <b-ot> Correction, <NoiseEee> what makes you think you need to bind it to 'tocument' ?
[17:16:29] <NoiseEee> ha
[17:16:32] <Scriptonaut> because, the markup is added asynchornously after page load
[17:16:33] <jphase> hah
[17:16:43] <jphase> Scriptonaut: then bind it AS you add it asyncronously
[17:16:58] <jphase> you don't NEED a delegated event listener, just use .on on the object as you append it
[17:17:19] <jphase> $('<li>').appendTo( 'body' ).on('click', function() { // stuff });
[17:17:23] <Scriptonaut> I could do that, it's seperated quite a bit in this homegrown framework though.
[17:17:47] <jphase> it's honestly cleaner in terms of memory to do it that way anyhow
[17:17:52] <Scriptonaut> ya
[17:17:57] <jphase> it's not going to run the event on the entire document - just the needed element
[17:19:45] <NoiseEee> Scriptonaut: can;t you just give that 'new thing' a class of some sort?
[17:22:06] <Scriptonaut> yes, it does have a class
[17:23:54] <NoiseEee> so then you can just delegate with $(document).on('click','.theClassOfThingsAdded', function() {} )
[17:30:13] <Scriptonaut> The problem is there are tons of things with this class, I specifically need the one that is the child of my element. I figured it out, I ended up binding it when I add it to the page
[17:35:17] <bilb_ono> does anyone know a good timeslider plugin where the “current time” pin stays still and you slide the slider with all the times instead
[17:35:22] <bilb_ono> as opposed to sliding the pin
[18:09:34] <FeyFre> people, any libraries to draw interactive charts using JS on client side?
[18:12:00] <jerit> so I want to hide a div when the user is at the top of the page but show it when they scroll past the top of the content, any ideas?
[18:57:09] <jose3_> I.e if its a form field I would use ```<%= f.text_field :title, class: "form-control" %>```, but what do I use for a dropdown option-select menu?
[18:57:30] <jose3_> what  should I use because form control doesnt work?
[19:17:37] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[19:17:53] <jose3_> wee
[19:18:26] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ what's your question?
[19:19:27] <robertmaxrees> feel like i missed half.
[20:12:16] <Megamos> Working with javascript always makes me sad, cause I'm so bad at it. Anyone feel like making me happy by explaining why my delete button isn't working in this pen, http://codepen.io/megamos/pen/MyVvdW?editors=1111 ? Deleting works on my site, but it calls a page reload even when using preventDefault.
[20:18:49] <shoky> Megamos: first of all doing .attr("id", "template") sets the id to template.  you want  .attr("id") === "template"
[20:19:38] <shoky> Megamos: and 2nd issue is that the delete buttons in new rows did not exist on page load, where the query $(".deleteOccasion")  happens.  so that query only finds the first row's button.
[20:20:33] <shoky> Megamos: you should use event delegation, catch the event in a container element that exists e.g. #occasions.  read about event delegation in the docs for .on()
[20:21:01] <Megamos> shoky: thanks mate. Shall do.
[20:23:07] <acidjazz> megamos so emotional
[20:23:09] <acidjazz> about it
[20:25:50] <Megamos> everytime I need to write some js in my rails app I get headaches. To me, wierd shit is happening and I can't debug anything mostly. But I know it's just my lack of knowledge.

[21:06:21] <TheHackOps> I have a click event bound like so, .on("click",".class",() => {console.log($(this).data('blaa'))})
[21:06:34] <TheHackOps> But I keep getting undefined from the data
[21:06:50] <TheHackOps> when I directly access the element through the console, It works
[21:10:43] <taplar> i thought one of the perks of => was that it didn't change what 'this' referred to
[21:11:51] <TheHackOps> taplar, Should make no difference
[21:11:57] <TheHackOps> I am compiling it down to es5 with webpack
[21:12:31] <taplar> *shrug* have you tried just console.log(this) to see what it is?
[21:12:36] <TheHackOps> welp
[21:12:38] <TheHackOps> I was wront
[21:12:39] <TheHackOps> wrong
[21:12:46] <TheHackOps> the arrow function makes a big difference
[21:12:49] <taplar> yep
[21:12:58] <TheHackOps> sadface
[21:14:27] <TheHackOps> Time to diff them
[21:14:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3d4un18e/
[21:15:07] <TheHackOps> oh'
[21:15:09] <TheHackOps> good god
[21:15:15] <taplar> :)
[21:15:22] <TheHackOps> It completely changes the scope of this
[21:19:22] <TheHackOps> what if I pass this into the arrow function
[21:19:39] <taplar> i don't think you can
[21:20:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3d4un18e/1/ <-- so this doesn't work for you?
[21:20:43] <TheHackOps> Ill give it a shot
[21:23:47] <TheHackOps> taplar, even more weird shit happens
[21:23:54] <TheHackOps> it works sometime
[21:23:58] <taplar> heh, awesome
[21:24:01] <TheHackOps> sometimes, and then stops working
[21:24:25] <TheHackOps> it works until the page has loaded
[21:24:28] <TheHackOps> lol
[21:24:32] <taplar> :/
[21:26:38] <TheHackOps> taplar, Back to the old style of functions i go
[22:43:39] <vanny> hi all
