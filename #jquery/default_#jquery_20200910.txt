[23:16:41] <baruna> hi, somebody here? https://jsfiddle.net/ymsuvrxt/1/ what's wrong with my regexp? I'm getting some unexpected results. why isn't it just putting [[ and ]] to the strings in replacements?
[23:16:59] <robertmaxrees> baruna that's not a jquery question ;)
[23:17:29] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ok sorry
