[03:51:13] <nikio_> Which library should i use if I have to spin up a webapp userinterface within two days. It has to have a good look and feel and the library should be easy to work with. So far I am considering JQuery Mobile or Bootstrap.
[04:01:58] <thedonut> 2 days eh
[04:18:54] <sopparus> you better be fast
[04:29:52] <nikio_> : D
[04:29:57] <nikio_> fine
[04:30:01] <nikio_> ill go for jquerymobile
[04:32:53] <localh0st> Hey, I've got problem with file download via js on Firefox, I've used temporary <a> element with attributes and triggered .click() action on it, it was working a couple of months ago but now it's doing nothing... something have changed recently? This is my code: https://pastebin.com/NyJNFsYA
[04:33:21] <localh0st> it doesn't log any errors to console on firefox, on chrome is works nicely
[04:34:07] <localh0st> (url leads to generated pdf file)
[04:34:17] <Cork> localh0st: could you make a jsfiddle?
[04:35:01] <Cork> i suspect the reason is the download property is meant to be used with data uris, not sure if it is actually expected to work with remote resources
[04:35:53] <Cork> (also this question is prob better asked in #firefox (with a testcase))
[04:35:59] <AdamPDotty> Also FF has decided to pollute global scope (if you work with IDs).
[04:36:18] <localh0st> Cork: I'll try to append the element to the document's body and then trigger click on DOM element, maybe this is the reason, give me a sec...
[04:36:37] <Cork> localh0st: ya i know what you're trying to do
[04:36:53] <Cork> the problem is normally following links is restricted to trusted event
[04:37:01] <Cork> and js triggered events aren't
[04:42:45] <localh0st> Cork: ok, appending 'link' variable to document.body with .appendChild(link) fixed the problem
[04:43:35] <Al_nz1> Cork: dont suppose you could do me a favour?
[04:43:39] <Cork> ah, the link wasn't in the document, ok ya that i would expect to have undefined behavior
[06:44:32] <Robinson> Is there a way to add jquery ui manually to jquery?
[06:44:54] <Robinson> like something similar to this? $.ui = require("jquery-ui);
[06:45:20] <Robinson> I'm trying to browserify jquery-ui and jquery but it doesn't seem to be working
[06:45:30] <Robinson> however doing it the regular way through html scripts works
[07:11:19] <Cork> Robinson: jquery ui extends jquery not just $.ui
[07:11:36] <Cork> for example it replaces toggleClass/addClass/removeClass
[07:14:06] <Robinson> Cork, in other words there is no way then hmmm
[07:14:12] <Robinson> no easy way*
[07:14:21] <Cork> not that i know of at least
[07:29:20] <adv_> anyone can help with this? https://codepen.io/maddenamy/pen/RreXwo this works fine but when i put var elem = $('#navigation');
[07:29:20] <adv_> var swipe = new Hammer(elem); it results in error
[07:31:46] <Cork> adv_: put is where?
[07:31:55] <`ph8> Hi all, i'm using $.ajax to make a request to a backend service, which responds with a 303 - i want to catch that 303 and do some things rather than have jquery follow it automatically (which is what seems to be happening at the moment). If i use `statusCode` it only tells me about the 200 resulting from the redirect rather than the redirect itself, can anyone help?
[07:32:20] <Cork> `ph8: you can't
[07:32:22] <adv_> Cork, on top , instead of new Hammer (document)
[07:32:35] <Cork> `ph8: 3xx responses are transparent to js with xhr so you can't ever see them
[07:33:36] <Cork> adv_: Hammer expects dom elements not jquery objects https://jsfiddle.net/7kdx48on/
[07:33:54] <`ph8> Cork: oh noes!
[07:34:09] <`ph8> So instead of returning a 303 from my backend i should 200 on some kind of special object that i parse and decide to redirect off in my client?
[07:34:11] <Cork> `ph8: the only option you have is to modify the server to not send a redirect
[07:34:42] <Cork> well there is the option to use the new js fetch command instead of xhr, but the browser support is quite low as it is so new
[07:34:46] <adv_> Cork, ah thanks. let me whip up something, maybe you can help
[07:35:03] <adv_> is codepen broken btw?
[07:35:24] <Cork> i don't trust codepen or jsbin for collaborate editing
[07:35:43] <Cork> they work fine as long as only one person modifies them, but loses changes left right and center if more then one modifies them
[07:37:43] <adv_> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/gbfmqe60/
[07:38:12] <adv_> i want to begin cycling through the thumbnails when a swiperight is happening on a specific thumbnaill
[07:38:19] <adv_> *thumbnail
[07:40:03] <Cork> adv_: why not just bind the two events separately?
[07:40:42] <adv_> Cork, not sure what you mean
[07:41:38] <Cork> instead of .on('swipeleft swiperight', function() { if ... })
[07:41:55] <Cork> just do .on('swipeleft', function() {}).on('swiperight', function() {})
[07:42:48] <Cork> i don't have touch device i can use here so debugging hammer becomes quite hard (never used it before)
[07:43:30] <Cork> adv_: but i talked about this https://jsfiddle.net/gbfmqe60/1/
[07:44:00] <adv_> Cork, you can swipe right with the mouse
[07:45:07] <Cork> ya, sometimes, but the swipeleft event doesn't work
[07:45:09] <adv_> Cork, the problem is the cycling begins and ends on all thumbs, i want just the specific thumb
[07:45:35] <`ph8> thanks Cork!
[07:46:08] <adv_> yeah same thing for me too, maybe it locks up somewhere?
[07:46:43] <Cork> adv_: i suspect the hammer head plugin is the problem
[07:47:19] <adv_> head?
[07:47:34] <Cork> lol -head :)
[07:47:43] <adv_> i don't care that much about the left one
[07:47:57] <burzum> this.element.append($(this.settings.formTemplate)); why is this showing me [object Object] instead of the markup? formTemplate is a string of html
[07:48:10] <adv_> can i use $(this) to target specific thumb?
[07:48:58] <Cork> yup
[07:49:16] <Cork> and that might actually be one of the reasons for the problems
[07:49:23] <Cork> you have <a> tags inside the slides
[07:49:33] <Cork> and those are by default draggable
[07:50:15] <adv_> 		$(this).find('.slides').removeClass('active').cycle('resume');
[07:50:55] <Cork> .closest
[07:50:57] <Cork> not .find
[07:51:00] <Cork> .find looks for children
[07:51:13] <Cork> actually...
[07:51:22] <adv_> [cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector
[07:51:24] <Cork> your already targeting the slides, so you don't need find or closest at all
[07:51:36] <sigdk> this function fails at line when the program is deployed on one machine but not when on another: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/032213fbeefe5c292e2b4771983cc4a7  (error: "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined")  In both cases the call to the backend successfully returns a json. Any insight?
[07:51:51] <adv_> Cork, can i use preventdefault for <a> or smth?
[07:52:20] <adv_> https://jsfiddle.net/gbfmqe60/2/
[07:54:11] <sigdk> *at line 10
[07:54:25] <Cork> ah, now i see, the swipe the parent ul not the lis
[07:57:48] <Cork> adv_: hammer.on isn't jquery on functions they have different structures https://jsfiddle.net/gbfmqe60/3/
[07:58:16] <Cork> swipeleft didn't work cause you can't combine them in one event handler as you can with jquery.on
[07:59:14] <Cork> sigdk: same browser model and version?
[07:59:45] <sigdk> Cork, yes, same client. I just deploy it in different machines
[07:59:48] <Cork> also i would console.log(data)
[07:59:50] <adv_> Cork, thanks but will only work on the first thumb
[07:59:59] <adv_> i suspect this is because of the [0]/
[08:00:00] <adv_> ?
[08:00:22] <Cork> ya
[08:00:28] <adv_> Cork, you can combine them
[08:00:36] <Cork> you would have to check Hammers documentation if it can handle multiple elements
[08:00:51] <Cork> and in what format that would be
[08:01:12] <adv_> Cork, https://codepen.io/jtangelder/pen/lgELw
[08:01:46] <Cork> adv_: that only uses one element
[08:01:57] <Cork> document.getElementById('myElement'); <-- only returns one element
[08:02:00] <Cork> (ever)
[08:02:09] <adv_> yes
[08:02:23] <adv_> ah the problem is wrapping hammer around each one of the thumbs?
[08:02:31] <Cork> no
[08:02:46] <Cork> the problem is you need to see if there is a way to use hammer with multiple elements not just one
[08:03:30] <adv_> https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer.js/issues/163
[08:03:33] <adv_> like this one?
[08:03:36] <Cork> else you will have to do something like $(".slideshow-block").each(function() { new Hammer(this); })
[08:03:56] <Cork> no
[08:04:10] <Cork> that is about a problem with multiple images in the same slide
[08:04:20] <Cork> not multiple slides
[08:04:30] <MikeD_> "the problem is wrapping hammer around each one of the thumbs?"  <-- i'm glad i didn't miss that before it scrolled off my screen  :)
[08:05:03] <Cork> MikeD_: lol didn't even think about that XD
[08:06:05] <adv_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32261384/is-there-a-way-to-have-one-hammer-event-for-multiple-objects
[08:06:25] <adv_> Cork, would that help?
[08:06:39] <adv_> lol MikeD_
[08:06:47] <adv_> haha
[08:06:56] <sigdk> Cork, data looks like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bd97e45e7756a6b943f91ab1cb16cf76   console.log(users); is undefined though.... do you see anything weird in the json?
[08:10:12] <Cork> sigdk: is this the content of data or data.data?
[08:10:46] <Cork> also if you do console.log(typeof(users)) what does it give you?
[08:11:06] <Cork> ah, wait no that can't be it...
[08:11:22] <sigdk> what you see in the url is data.    users = data.data; prints undefined
[08:11:38] <sigdk> I'm wondering whether that's even a json
[08:11:57] <Cork> so you want to do data.map not users
[08:12:09] <Cork> cause there is no data property in the data variable
[08:12:28] <sigdk> Cork, there is. The array
[08:12:35] <Cork> ya, exactly
[08:12:43] <Cork> [] not { data: [] }
[08:12:51] <hellyeah> can i use .scroll events for any object?
[08:13:06] <Cork> hellyeah: sure, if you fire the scroll event your self
[08:13:17] <Cork> but the browser won't fire events for none dom elements
[08:13:52] <hellyeah> none dom elements? what do yuou mean?
[08:14:10] <Cork> ok, lets back up a bit, what do you mean by object?
[08:14:20] <hellyeah> ah sorry
[08:14:29] <hellyeah> i mean elements, div
[08:14:35] <Cork> cause there are quite a few things that are objects in js :)
[08:14:49] <Cork> then i don't understand what you're asking about...
[08:14:52] <hellyeah> sorry for confusing in terminology
[08:15:00] <hellyeah> i will show you
[08:15:20] <sigdk> Cork, isn't this a valid json: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d213a4ef9d1966739602714a5efe9b5f   ? How should it be?
[08:15:22] * hellyeah opening js link
[08:15:56] <Cork> sigdk: as long as ... isn't the actual content of data sure it is
[08:17:09] <sigdk> I really don't get it. excuse me
[08:17:19] <adv_> Cork, any idea?
[08:17:38] <adv_> also found http://jsfiddle.net/ekdfokc5/9/
[08:17:59] <Cork> adv_: not really, i gave you a solution though
[08:18:28] <adv_> Cork, is that the one in the last fiddle?
[08:18:33] <hellyeah> Cork:  circle follow mouse movement i want to make it scroll when you move object below area of the page. Do i need to use infinite scrolling for that? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nuc7ay42/16/
[08:19:13] <Cork> adv_: i gave it to you in the channel
[08:19:32] <hellyeah> sigdk:  https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-json--active-8817
[08:20:29] <sigdk> hellyeah, have you also identified the problem?
[08:21:05] <hellyeah> sorry i just got like you have problem about constructing JSON
[08:22:10] <hellyeah> Cork:  why scroll event is not fired? Can you help me about that?
[08:22:37] <Cork> hellyeah: cause scroll is when the page is scrolling
[08:22:44] <Cork> not when the overflow height is changing
[08:22:45] <sigdk> Cork, I think the problem is that the headers are not set to application/json
[08:22:55] <hellyeah> ah hmm
[08:25:41] <hellyeah> Cork:  any suggestion to solve that issue?
[08:27:15] <Cork> hellyeah: sadly it is complicated as window is super special and not the same cross browsers
[08:27:51] <hellyeah> so i have to use different tricks for every browser?
[08:27:59] <hellyeah> damn
[08:28:59] <hellyeah> is there any other solution for that?
[08:29:25] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/nuc7ay42/17/
[08:29:44] <hellyeah> Cork:  not sure i need scroll i just need to do smt like that please click "play"
[08:30:29] <hellyeah> damn
[08:31:08] <hellyeah> ah i see
[08:31:20] <hellyeah> Cork:  why + 20 ?
[08:39:52] <Cork> hellyeah: just to give a little margin around the object
[08:40:19] <Cork> else you get the window height/width + the size of the circle and no a pixel extra
[08:41:47] <hellyeah> is it like that Cork https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nuc7ay42/18/ ?
[08:42:24] <Cork> why you're asking me? :D
[08:42:38] <hellyeah> dont know :p
[08:42:56] <hellyeah> anyway sorry it doesnt work on firefox btw
[08:42:59] <Cork> it was you who wanted the feature, so you should be able to answer if it does what you want ^^'
[08:43:04] <Cork> hmm
[08:43:09] <hellyeah> this solution works for chrome
[08:43:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:43:44] <hellyeah> let me check for that
[08:44:10] <hellyeah> but i got a question it work when you move object to right or down but not working if you move object left or up why is that?
[08:44:46] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't get a negative scroll offset
[08:44:52] <hellyeah> ah
[08:45:03] <hellyeah> understand
[08:50:10] <Cork> hellyeah: ah, i see what it is, firefox updates the scrollHeight async so it doesn't work
[08:50:17] <Cork> donno about a solution for that then
[08:50:36] <hellyeah> oh damn
[08:51:38] <hellyeah> hmm i should use game engine probably
[08:51:52] <Cork> or just use canvas
[08:52:23] <Cork> then you can pan what you want to have as a background how every you like
[09:15:48] <leetflakes> best way to include a custom embed script that uses Zepto and then continue with jQuery?
[09:17:57] <adv_> Cork, can you help? http://jsfiddle.net/736pce37/
[09:18:28] <adv_> Cork, did the multiple hammer binding but not sure about line 18 in js . doesn't work
[09:27:15] <Cork> adv_: are you sure hammer can work without ul/lis?
[09:27:23] <adv_> yes
[09:27:37] <adv_> view-source:http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/basic.html
[09:28:04] <adv_> Cork, this is better http://jsfiddle.net/rm80km47/1/
[09:28:21] <adv_> i have doubletap instead of swipe to make debugging easier
[09:30:07] <Cork> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/rm80km47/3/
[09:31:51] <adv_> Cork, hm it doesn't cycle for me
[09:31:55] <adv_> broken images?
[09:32:00] <adv_> it blinks
[09:32:13] <Cork> possibly
[09:32:31] <adv_> no, the images are not the problem
[09:32:50] <adv_> i also removed lazyload , http://jsfiddle.net/rm80km47/5/
[09:32:57] <adv_> still doesn't work
[09:35:23] <adv_> Cork, weird
[09:36:21] <adv_> ah
[09:36:23] <adv_> it's the css
[09:39:55] <adv_> Cork, now it works, but there's a glitch during the start, at the loading of the images
[09:40:00] <adv_> visual glitch
[09:42:15] <leetflakes> is it common for an external script to cause $ to become undefined?
[10:00:34] <maslo> how would I find all elements that have class .form-control and also attribute disabled="disabled" ? would the following work find('.form-control[disabled="disabled"]').length
[10:08:00] <Duikb00t> hi, can jquery compare classes that are added on the fly?
[10:08:33] <Duikb00t> I have this https://kopy.io/Bcwcu#ecWJk9wvjQVuJC  code but it seems it's not able to check if that element has a class validor not
[10:21:20] <localh0st> Duikb00t: it should work, do you catch any errors?
[10:21:46] <Duikb00t> Go tit woheoheoew
[10:21:49] <Duikb00t> got it *
[10:22:34] <localh0st> Duikb00t: ?
[10:22:41] <Duikb00t> Yeah no idea what happend but it works
[10:22:44] <Duikb00t> now
[10:22:54] <localh0st> fine ;)
[10:25:37] <Duikb00t> thx
[10:28:20] <adv_> Cork, hm so i added <a> to the slides and now it's not working
[10:28:31] <adv_> how can i use preventdefault or something to overcome this?
[10:29:06] <JrWebDev> $('.button').on('change, function() { if ($(this).prop('checked')) { $('.button2').prop('disabled', true) } else { $('.button2').prop('disabled', false) }   when i first load my page the .button2 is disabled.  only when i click the checkbox will it work
[10:29:36] <JrWebDev> when i first load the page .button2 is enabled***

[11:08:34] <catbadger> hey all!
[11:28:56] <dimi1947> take a look here https://hastebin.com/diyubetofu.pl and just tell me if the result of a serialize operation(the string produced)seems ok to you given the values of the name attributes)
[11:29:51] <dimi1947> if you want me I can prepare a fiddle
[12:04:01] <emporio> Can someone solves this?

[12:14:09] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[12:23:35] <catbadger> emprorio why is your html bad?
[12:25:56] <catbadger> emporio you can pm me. i'm busy and at work
[12:26:13] <emporio> catbadger: hi will do
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[12:28:16] <pheurton> is there a way to .serializeArray only certain elements in a form, i.e. they have a certain class applied?
[12:29:13] <robertmaxrees> pheurton https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ -> " operates on a jQuery collection of forms and/or form controls."
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> so you can do $('.someClass').serialieArray();
[12:29:25] <robertmaxrees> should work fine :)
[12:31:07] <pheurton> Thanks. It says you can operate on a collection of form controls, but that doesn't seem to be working for me. I must be doing something wrong
[12:31:24] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us in a fiddle?
[12:32:02] <pheurton> I would but it's time for me to go home ;)
[12:32:04] <pheurton> thanks for the help
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[12:36:32] <catbadger> emporio https://jsfiddle.net/nrdqw70o/
[12:38:25] <catbadger> emporio this is a totally incorrect fix, but should work around the php problem in your theme
[12:38:46] <emporio> can I just apply it as-is?
[12:39:10] <catbadger> probably not. it's more of an illustration. you will likely need to apply other container selectors
[12:39:27] <catbadger> if you don't want to fix the php error in your theme, my fix is a workaround.
[12:40:34] <emporio> ok let me change some values
[12:40:48] <emporio> perhaps you can apply the fix also on the SO question?
[12:40:59] <emporio> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45038916/make-srcset-attribute-work-for-internet-explorer-in-broken-html-tag
[12:41:11] <emporio> get some points
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:42:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the backend you're using?
[12:42:13] <emporio> it's Wordpress PHP
[12:42:21] <emporio> with a theme we boguht called Electro
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd contact the theme dev and let them know
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> regardless of how you fix.
[12:46:07] <emporio> yeah
[12:46:16] <emporio> now there are no images showing since I applied the fix
[12:46:22] <emporio> I guess that solves it :p
[12:46:54] <robertmaxrees> heh, you paid for the theme - any reason you can't ask them to fix?
[12:48:57] <catbadger> emporio i did put it on SO
[12:48:59] <catbadger> ;)
[12:49:24] <emporio> ok ;)
[12:49:51] <catbadger> emporio I'm a wordpress guy as well. If you're looking to have it fixed. email me (pmed email address)
[12:50:11] <emporio> i no get email address
[12:50:34] <catbadger> just sent
[12:50:51] <catbadger> I am not available until 6pm(GMT-8)
[12:50:55] <catbadger> ;)
[12:51:08] <catbadger> but can maybe take a look on my break or something.
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> lol.  really should be handled by the theme dev.
[13:12:53] <catbadger> i agree, but if the theme dev isn't fixing it, I can provide a fix for a nominal fee that will get it up and running

[13:18:21] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/255scqtj/1/
[13:18:43] <plamb> it may be the case that i can only do it by reloading the page, i just wanted to check
[13:20:37] <taplar> what url?
[13:20:57] <plamb> http://www.snappydata.io/download#snappydownload
[13:20:59] <plamb> i guess
[13:21:14] <plamb> adding that hash fires a little chatbot thing
[13:21:26] <plamb> i wanted to see if I could have it open when download is clicked vs having to reload the page
[13:21:38] <taplar> so you want to go to that url in the current window/new window?
[13:21:59] <plamb> in the current window, but is it only possible to do that by reloading the page?
[13:22:17] <taplar> you can reference the window.location to change the current pages url
[13:22:38] <plamb> hmm i wonder if that would do it
[13:22:56] <plamb> so would it just be window.location("http://www.snappydata.io/download#snappydownload")
[13:24:29] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location
[13:29:01] <plamb> window.pushState may be what i want
[13:29:27] <plamb> or maybe replaceState
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> do you want hashes or new urls?
[13:30:28] <plamb> this third party chatbot requires a url its running on loaded with a named hash, in this case "#snappydownload"
[13:30:54] <plamb> im not sure if i could just append a hash to the URL to trigger it
[13:30:56] <plamb> need to try
[13:35:45] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/255scqtj/3/
[13:35:46] <plamb> hmm
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> you window.location.hash if you want to set the hash.
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> for the current page i mean.
[13:38:03] <plamb> ill try that
[13:38:57] <plamb> would it be like this
[13:38:58] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/255scqtj/7/
[13:39:18] <plamb> oh wow that worked
[13:39:22] <plamb> thank you
[13:39:23] <robertmaxrees> aye.  though there's literally no reason to do that btw.
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> <a href="#snappydownload" class="fileFormat">.tar</a>
[13:40:12] <plamb> right but that href already has to point at that third party github URL
[13:40:15] <plamb> to download the file
[13:40:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[13:40:33] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> i gotcha
[14:33:37] <royalty> hello, i have a question about passing data between functions in jquery
[14:34:36] <royalty> for example suppose I have this code $('.form-class').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.ajax({})} suppose i wanted to pass the form's $(this) to the ajax function success message
[14:34:46] <royalty> i mean
[14:34:51] <royalty> to the ajax success function
[14:35:37] <royalty> if anyone wants i can make my question more clear
[14:35:44] <taplar2> scope it before perform the ajax call
[14:36:01] <royalty> what do you mean by scope it?
[14:36:13] <taplar2> var $form = $(this);  $.ajax({...., success: function(){ /* i can use $form in here */ }})
[14:36:21] <royalty> ahhh
[14:36:22] <royalty> alright
[14:36:28] <royalty> thanks
[14:37:55] <royalty> just curious
[14:38:10] <royalty> suppose i was given the greenlight to use ES6, this is hypothetical
[14:38:21] <royalty> would i somehow be able to utilize the => to achieve the same thing?
[14:38:27] <taplar2> then you wouldn't have to do that
[14:38:37] <taplar2> arrow functions should allow you to use the 'this' as the form still
[14:39:02] <royalty> i see, would that mess up the ummm, this of the ajax function somehow and ruin it or something? I'm just curious
[14:39:24] <royalty> so if i were to do it in es6 would it be success => function(data) {}
[14:39:26] <taplar> not unless you are using the 'this' in the success for other things
[14:39:34] <taplar> yep
[14:39:41] <taplar> err, no
[14:39:45] <taplar> success => {}
[14:39:52] <taplar> blah, lol
[14:39:52] <royalty> oh weird
[14:39:53] <royalty> lol
[14:40:05] <taplar> success: data => { /* do stuff */ }
[14:40:15] <royalty> one day i plan to learn react native more so only reason i'm curious
[14:40:21] <royalty> stuck doing paid client work now
[14:40:24] <royalty> it makes the $.$
[14:40:36] <taplar> :)
[14:41:08] <taplar> in general, if you only have one input and one statement it's just
[14:41:14] <taplar> input => operation
[14:41:25] <taplar> if you have multiple inputs
[14:41:35] <taplar> (input1, input2) => input1 + input2
[14:41:37] <taplar> or whatever
[14:41:42] <taplar> if you have multiple statements
[14:42:07] <taplar> input1 => { /* my multiple statements, does not implicitly return result */ }
[14:42:15] <royalty> I'll try and keep that in mind when I get to that stuff
[14:42:37] <taplar> personally i'd suggest looking into the use of babel
[14:43:02] <taplar> it will let you write ES6 now, and will compile down to ES5 for now until it gets more prevalent
[15:26:09] <adv_> what plugin should i use for lazy loading images on mobile (viewable in the viewport) ?
[17:15:41] <Braden`> Hello!
[17:15:53] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/6BR450H5 <-- Is there a way to make all post data from the forms also included in that ajax call?
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> "all post data from the forms"|?
[17:16:48] <taplar> what is #uploadImage ?
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:17:14] <robertmaxrees> i mean, yeah.  there is.
[17:17:18] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  Form, sorry
[17:17:19] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial.
[17:17:25] <robertmaxrees> you mean the current form?
[17:17:25] <Braden`> Typo ftw
[17:17:29] <Braden`> Yes
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> are you tryinmg to upload images?
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> along with form data?
[17:17:40] <Braden`> Currently its sending a binary file
[17:17:48] <Braden`> But I don't see any other form data
[17:17:57] <Braden`> unless its called something other than $_POST on the php side
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the form moarkup?
[17:20:52] <robertmaxrees> lol these dudes asking in multiple channels at once
[17:22:01] <Braden`> Sorry
[17:22:13] <Braden`> I asked in JS and realized I would get kicked out because its JQuery
[17:22:14] <EastFlow> I hate when my postbackUrl doesn't work.. grrrrr.. stupid apis
[17:22:32] <Braden`> It was my short-sightedness
[17:22:36] <Braden`> I mean no disrespect.
[17:22:42] <robertmaxrees> it's all good meng.
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> anyway, form markup?  the jQuery side of things looks okay./
[17:23:11] <Braden`> I will jsfiddle it
[17:32:08] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  https://jsfiddle.net/Braden1/zzaf7r1q/
[17:33:28] <robertmaxrees> just on a hunch: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zzaf7r1q/1/
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> also:  you don't have multiple uploadImage ids right?
[17:38:16] <paulvonhoesslin> anyone there
[17:38:23] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:38:54] <paulvonhoesslin> how do I get the scroll position of a div wrapper, that inside a parent div
[17:39:02] <paulvonhoesslin> that has a overflow of scroll
[17:39:29] <paulvonhoesslin> the div.wrapper's height is much larger than the parent div
[17:40:16] <robertmaxrees> $('div').scrollTop();
[17:40:27] <robertmaxrees> where 'div' is the parent element that has a scrollbar.
[18:17:37] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/y1w1rzrL/7/
[18:17:45] <bigLanky> I have that, and it kind of works, but having some issues
[18:18:05] <bigLanky> so basically I am just filtering my results based on the checked boxes
[18:18:24] <bigLanky> so to do this, check Braintree, Express Checkout, Payflow Pro, then you can see how it filters the table
[18:18:41] <bigLanky> then, select Website Payments Pro 3.0, again, the list filters
[18:18:42] <robertmaxrees> btw you're includign jquery on that fiddle twice.
[18:19:08] <bigLanky> uncheck Website Payments Pro 3.0 and all results set back to normal
[18:19:16] <robertmaxrees> bigLanky ^^^
[18:19:34] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/y1w1rzrL/8/
[18:20:11] <robertmaxrees> also: are you able to whittle this down to not need almost 900 lines of markup?
[18:20:31] <bigLanky> it seems to work ok with 2 options, but any more than that it's no go
[18:20:37] <bigLanky> yeah 1 sec
[18:21:31] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm guessign your issue is that when you check 2 or more filters, you want all results that have any of those options, not results with just those options?
[18:22:58] <robertmaxrees> aaaah it'
[18:23:05] <robertmaxrees> *it's just when you uncheck it.  gotcha
[18:24:04] <Al_nz1> I have a ajax-bootstrap select dropdown ( https://github.com/truckingsim/Ajax-Bootstrap-Select ) which works well sending data to the backend. But if I am loading data from the database I am having trouble to get the selected value displayed in the ajax bootstrap selected. To try and work it outmyself i looked at how the DOM is changing when a value is selected - then I would at least know what
[18:24:05] <Al_nz1> html is generated, it seemed that selected="selected" was added in the <option value="xx" ... tag but when I hand edited this to verify it didnt change the current selection. How to work out whats going on?
[18:24:09] <robertmaxrees> woah
[18:24:10] <Al_nz1> apologies if too far OT
[18:24:32] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 uh... gotta fiddle with a basic question?
[18:24:58] <robertmaxrees> is it that you';re trying to set an option in a select?
[18:26:25] <Al_nz1> essentially - but the dropdown has a text box, type in a few characters and a result set is sent to the dropdown to populate the list. If I am sending a completed form to the view, I need it to display the selected value in this dropdown.
[18:26:49] <robertmaxrees> "a completed form"?
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> you mean the markup itself?
[18:26:56] <Al_nz1> so it can both set a value and display a value
[18:27:32] <Al_nz1> make sense?
[18:27:39] <robertmaxrees> "If I am sending a
[18:27:39] <robertmaxrees> completed form to the view,
[18:27:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ stuck on that.
[18:27:56] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle and show us the data you're shuttling back?
[18:28:10] <robertmaxrees> because, as we've explored before, setting an option for a select is trivial.
[18:28:52] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes - I havent forgotten - but as I pointed out I have edited the dom to add selected="selected" and it didnt change whats displayed in the dropdown
[18:29:05] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn't be editing the DOM to do so :)
[18:29:12] <robertmaxrees> dunno how that's relevant in this case.
[18:30:19] <Al_nz1> I thought that if I could make the rendered view change by editing it directly, then at least I would know what html I need to get the server to produce.
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> you shoudln't be sending back HTML.
[18:30:48] <Al_nz1> assuming i could edit the rendered view correctly to get it to show the selected value - that was my reasoning
[18:31:30] <Al_nz1> what do you mean I shouldnt be sending back html?
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> you... shouldn't send back html.
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> like, send JSON.
[18:32:03] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out what html to use for that plugin you linked?
[18:32:17] <Al_nz1> when the form is loaded - its html. when the form is submitted isnt that also html?
[18:32:32] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out what html to use for that plugin you linked?
[18:32:39] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes to get it to display the selected value
[18:32:54] <robertmaxrees> did you read the minimum requirements on that github repo?
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/truckingsim/Ajax-Bootstrap-Select#requirements check out the second bullet point on that.
[18:34:24] <Al_nz1> yes I did. And as I said the ajax dropdown works in so far as it will get a filtered list to populate the dropdown. But when the form loads I need it to display a already selected value if one is returned from the database.
[18:34:43] <robertmaxrees> "when the form loads" as in "when the page loads"?
[18:35:00] <Al_nz1> yes
[18:35:16] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to initialize the plugin with a preselected value.
[18:35:27] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: nicely put
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> classic x/y type question ;)
[18:36:21] <Al_nz1> yes I did. And as I said the ajax dropdown works in so far as it will get a filtered list to populate the dropdown. But when the form loads I need it to display a already selected value if one is returned from the database.
[18:36:25] <Al_nz1> bugger sorry on that
[18:36:27] <Al_nz1> repost
[18:36:33] <Al_nz1> I think I have found the answer though
[18:36:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:36:48] <Al_nz1> there is a preserve selected
[18:37:26] <Al_nz1> that sound like what I want
[18:37:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:38:07] <robertmaxrees> so in the future, describe the basic thing you're trying to accomplish instead of explaining your method.  when you explain the method before the goal, we have absolutely no context on what you're trying to do :)
[18:38:46] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: putting it so succintly is an art
[18:39:02] <robertmaxrees> nah, just gotta start with "I'm trying to do x"
[18:43:39] <bigLanky> robertmaxrees yeah so on mine when you uncheck it only works for 2
[18:43:43] <bigLanky> but adding a 3rd breaks it
[18:43:50] <bigLanky> I need the results to have ALL filters enabled
[18:46:21] <robertmaxrees> so your code looks a little convoluted.
[18:46:23] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:46:30] <robertmaxrees> mind if I make somne suggestions on an alternative approach?
[18:48:52] <robertmaxrees> bigLanky
[18:49:03] <bigLanky> sure
[18:49:09] <bigLanky> you see what I am trying to do right?
[18:49:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're trying to show any TR that has at least one product ID that matched any selected checkbox
[18:49:44] <bigLanky> basically have thsi table with a bunch of rows... then each <tr> has a data-products attribute which contains a list of integers and these integers correspond to each checkbox
[18:50:06] <bigLanky> yeah, so if I have multiple product ID, the <tr> needs to contain ALL
[18:50:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:50:15] <robertmaxrees> ah./
[18:50:18] <robertmaxrees> okay/
[18:51:06] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/y1w1rzrL/11/
[18:51:12] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple to do really.
[18:51:14] <bigLanky> there is a better version of the HTML
[18:51:14] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[18:52:43] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I am not sure preserveSelected is the answer - the default is true, so it should be doing it anyway
[18:53:20] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 make a fiddle then.
[18:53:20] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: preserveSelected is about keeping the selected between ajax requests to and from server
[18:53:30] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i can't see what you're seeing.
[18:53:36] <Al_nz1> how do I replicate the ajax in a fiddle?
[18:53:40] <Al_nz1> I could post a screenie
[18:53:48] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:53:52] <robertmaxrees> how does a screenshot help?
[18:53:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:53:58] <robertmaxrees> shjow the code and an example ajax response.
[18:54:13] <robertmaxrees> you can emulate ajax in jsfiddle.
[18:56:17] <Al_nz1> not my fiddle but this is the plugin in a fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/codeandcloud/a5r2vyu2/
[18:56:28] <robertmaxrees> okay./
[18:56:34] <robertmaxrees> can you update to demonstrate the issue you're having?
[18:56:58] <Al_nz1> load the select picker with a inital value
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> great - update it :)
[18:57:24] <Al_nz1> update it to what? that is the problem. If I could do that I wouldnt have a issue?
[18:57:41] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried at least.
[18:57:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5r2vyu2/116/
[18:58:09] <Al_nz1> I tried to manuipulate the dom to add a selected="selected" in the relevant option
[18:58:12] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> okay back up.
[18:58:22] <robertmaxrees> don't "manipulate dom" for stuff like this.
[18:58:23] <Al_nz1> but it doesnt load with a inital value?
[18:58:36] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle i just sent does.
[18:58:41] <robertmaxrees> it defaults to India
[19:00:03] <Al_nz1> hmmm
[19:01:27] <Al_nz1> so - thats not happening at my end. If I cant edit the DOM - what steps can I take to troubleshoot this?
[19:01:35] <robertmaxrees> edit your html.
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> editing "the DOM"
[19:01:44] <robertmaxrees> is too late.
[19:01:57] <robertmaxrees> gotta render with the proper initial value.
[19:03:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y1w1rzrL/15/ bigLanky this closer to what you want?
[19:03:47] <Al_nz1> I am putting what I think is the correct html in : https://pastebin.com/U97ZV0Lm
[19:04:05] <robertmaxrees> ps selected="selected" - just need "selected"
[19:04:09] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[19:04:26] <Al_nz1> but the selected option is not in the rendered html
[19:04:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5r2vyu2/117/
[19:04:36] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[19:04:49] <bigLanky> kind of, but looks like this is showing OR
[19:05:49] <robertmaxrees> that should be inclusive... hrmm.
[19:05:51] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/y1w1rzrL/16/  <-- my take on it
[19:06:08] <Al_nz1> maybe its the template processing engine thats screwing with the html thats going out
[19:06:17] <Al_nz1> I am not sure how to inspect what its generating
[19:06:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar hah, similar concept.
[19:07:04] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 is that the only element with .selectpicker as a class?
[19:07:25] <Al_nz1> no
[19:07:39] <robertmaxrees> what about reportstation?
[19:07:44] <Al_nz1> yes
[19:07:47] <Al_nz1> only one
[19:08:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5r2vyu2/118/ would somethiong like this help?
[19:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you could ditch the .val() and that'll give you the element itself/.
[19:12:25] <Al_nz1> lemme see what that produces
[19:14:39] <Al_nz1> dunno - its saying undefined
[19:15:00] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#reportstation').find(':selected').length);
[19:15:04] <robertmaxrees> what does that give you?
[19:18:05] <Al_nz1> 1
[19:18:14] <robertmaxrees> but the .val() gave you undefined?
[19:18:45] <Al_nz1> sorry I was using class not it. now it gives ""
[19:18:54] <Al_nz1> *not id
[19:18:58] <robertmaxrees> what if you ditch the .val() ?
[19:19:05] <robertmaxrees> should give you a clickable dom node
[19:19:43] <Al_nz1> yes it does
[19:24:39] <Al_nz1> now what?
[19:24:53] <Al_nz1> is this related : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14804253/how-to-set-selected-value-on-select-using-selectpicker-plugin-from-bootstrap ?
[19:33:39] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea because i don't know what your actual issue is Al_nz1
[19:33:48] <robertmaxrees> flying totally blind.
[19:34:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to change the selected value after it's initialized?
[19:34:58] <Al_nz1> no, on page load, i need the inital value selected (which comes from backend)
[19:35:11] <robertmaxrees> which i've shown you how to do.
[19:35:26] <Al_nz1> but it doesnt work this end
[19:36:03] <robertmaxrees> so try this: view the page source in your browser (not via the dev tools, but right-click -> view page source) and find that particular select.
[19:36:07] <robertmaxrees> and then share the markup.
[19:36:37] <Al_nz1> should I be able to set the selected item in console using a jquery selector? with .text and .val?
[19:36:53] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to do that at all.
[19:36:58] <robertmaxrees> .text() is not the right tool for the job.
[19:37:07] <robertmaxrees> .val() is if you're doing it after pageload.  but you're not./
[19:37:09] <Al_nz1> but for diagnostic purposes - is that helpful
[19:37:16] <robertmaxrees> why would it be helpful?
[19:37:22] <Al_nz1> thats what I am asking you
[19:37:26] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:37:27] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:37:37] <Al_nz1> it was a suggestion
[19:37:38] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[19:37:55] <robertmaxrees> you mentioned that maybe the markup is bad.
[19:38:04] <robertmaxrees> so verify the markup.

[19:38:21] <robertmaxrees> that's when you view source on the page?
[19:38:23] <Al_nz1> i note that the selected is not there. no idea why not
[19:38:25] <Al_nz1> yes
[19:38:34] <robertmaxrees> so what backend are you using?
[19:38:59] <Al_nz1> springboot which is passing it through thymeleaf
[19:39:14] <robertmaxrees> so then you need to fix that problem.
[19:39:33] <robertmaxrees> make sure there you get the selected attribute on there and you'll be g2g
[19:39:43] <Al_nz1> ok. thanks
[19:50:22] <adv_>  http://jsfiddle.net/vnus6xm3/11/, i need to get rid of line 2 in js because i want it to work on mobile, where there is no mousedown. can i convert it to hammer.js somehow?
[19:50:30] <proka> im getting with the $.get from google maps, but i want to put the values in a nicer way how to do this URL is $.get(url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=" + crd.latitude + "," + crd.longitude + "&key=API_KEY";...
[19:51:14] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: Im gtg
[19:51:18] <Al_nz1> thanks for the steer
[19:56:50] <robertmaxrees> proka what do you mean "put the values in a nicer way"?>
[19:57:29] <robertmaxrees> adv_ you want touchstart  maybe?
[19:58:05] <robertmaxrees> #rip
[19:58:12] <adv_> robertmaxrees, is that hammer.js?
[19:58:16] <robertmaxrees> that's native
[19:58:35] <adv_> robertmaxrees, i would prefer hammer.js to be portable 100%
[19:58:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:58:45] <adv_> in order to be*
[19:58:57] <robertmaxrees> $('.ts-inner').on('mousedown touchstart'
[19:59:06] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:59:29] <adv_> does that work on all mobile browsers?
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> http://caniuse.com/#search=touchstart
[20:00:16] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's all the browsers people generally care about.
[20:03:50] <adv_> http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/
[20:03:52] <adv_> is this any good?
[20:04:21] <adv_> i want to load images only when they appear on the viewport of the mobile device
[20:04:23] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/eisbehr-/jquery.lazy looks pretty low-key.  decent number of stars
[20:04:26] <adv_> robertmaxrees, thanks, that works
[20:04:36] <robertmaxrees> we wrote our own thing for that adv_
[20:04:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to do.
[20:05:05] <adv_> robertmaxrees, why write your own, sounds pretty common
[20:05:24] <robertmaxrees> because it was easy enought to do and nobody really offered a good solution for what we needed.
[20:05:34] <robertmaxrees> super simple to build really.
[20:05:52] <adv_> robertmaxrees, on the previous fiddle how can i reset to thumbnail 1 ?
[20:06:02] <adv_> set the container to thumb1
[20:06:28] <adv_> robertmaxrees, if it's simple why nobody offered a good solution? :/
[20:06:34] <robertmaxrees> i'
[20:06:44] <robertmaxrees> *i'd have to read the docs for whatever plugin you're using.
[20:06:48] <adv_> can you elaborate on your solution?
[20:07:01] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:07:03] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty basic.
[20:07:11] <adv_> i'm using cycle to cycle through
[20:07:48] <robertmaxrees> use data-src for all image tags.  on scroll, check for visibile imgs.  for those that are, set their src to whatever is in data-src
[20:09:43] <robertmaxrees> no clue for your weird carousel thing, tho i gotta ask: why are you using a carousel?
[20:10:27] <adv_> robertmaxrees, it was the easiest way for me to adapt that code
[20:10:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:10:45] <adv_> robertmaxrees, do you have a jsfiddle
[20:10:46] <adv_> ?
[20:10:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:10:52] <adv_> for what you describe
[20:10:55] <robertmaxrees> of the in-house lazy loader?
[20:11:06] <robertmaxrees> i ain't giving it away ;)
[20:11:12] <adv_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8325375/how-to-restart-a-cycle-that-has-been-stopped
[20:11:14] <adv_> lol why?
[20:11:26] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it's easy enough to build on your own.
[20:11:31] <robertmaxrees> or find your own plugin (shrug)
[20:11:53] <adv_> i'm not a web dev :/
[20:12:03] <robertmaxrees> so i should give you free code
[20:12:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:13:24] <robertmaxrees> also: if you're not a web dev, why are you writing code?
[20:13:25] <robertmaxrees> i'
[20:13:39] <robertmaxrees> *i'd argue writing code kind of qualifies you as a bit of a dev.
[20:14:45] <adv_> found the answer to the cycle plugin
[20:14:49] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[20:15:00] <adv_> i'm trying to wing it
[20:15:06] <adv_> it's for a personal project
[20:15:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just learn to code?
[20:15:14] <adv_> lol
[20:15:36] <adv_> i am a dev but js is a pain for me
[20:15:43] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that hard.
[20:17:54] <adv_> https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear ?
[20:20:05] <adv_> so for those that appear?
[20:20:13] <adv_> change data-src to src
[20:24:37] <royalty> adv_, inspect element on the demo page buddy
[21:11:11] <adv_> hm so touchstart breaks scrolling
[23:05:44] <Braden`> Hello!
[23:09:22] <Braden`> When I have an ajax call that is submitting a file, is it also possible to send all of the fields of the same form?  (e.g. $_POST items that appear on the PHP side)?
[23:13:54] <Braden`> Anyone?
