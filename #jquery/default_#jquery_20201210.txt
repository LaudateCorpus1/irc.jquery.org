[08:13:32] <cloud69> Trying to make a supersimple jQuery slider for my flexbox slides: https://codepen.io/weeeeeeeee/pen/eYddoMN - what'd be the best strategy here? Show one slide, hide it and move it to the back of the list, show the next one etc.?
[08:22:30] <undefined_bob> cloud69: I'm sorry, I can't really help you with that. I once tried to build a slider too but I failed. Then I used one of those available ready to go scripts and modified it a bit: https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/oQLvxR
[08:22:42] <undefined_bob> maybe that code can help you a bit
[08:24:25] <undefined_bob> or this one but they are quite similar https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/rQaboE
[08:25:52] <cloud69> undefined_bob: Thanks man! But yeah thats the thing, those ready made scripts are a bit too much
[08:26:05] <cloud69> Especially since I have slides with a lot of their own CSS
[08:30:45] <undefined_bob> cloud69: yeah I see. You could try to throw everything/every function you dont need out of the script. Or you can wait if someone with more knowledge here replies. But it has been a bit quiet in here the last days
[08:31:11] <cloud69> Thanks again Bob!
[08:31:14] <undefined_bob> but if you're patient, I think Robert will come online later
[15:48:47] <errorous> Hello. This is a thing, but I don't know the name, term, tech whatever. So say I have 9 sections in html, 3x3. the very middle one is in viewport. How would I call this functionality, where I can, on mobile, just swipe and move through the screens/views
[15:49:05] <errorous> only one of the sections can be in the viewport
[15:49:11] <robertmaxrees> that's a carousel
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> wait but it's 3x3??
[15:49:50] <robertmaxrees> so it's a carousel with horizontal and vertical movement??
[15:49:56] <errorous> robertmaxrees yeah
[15:50:00] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like it'll be really confusing to your end users.
[15:50:36] <errorous> and not a circular one, you cant go from 3rd coiumn to first
[15:50:54] <errorous> is there a name for that, other than carousel?
[15:51:05] <robertmaxrees> i've never even seen that in the wild.
[15:51:11] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing this somewhere?
[15:51:37] <errorous> come on? yeah, but forgot where
[15:51:46] <errorous> do you understand what I'm trying to achieve?>
[15:51:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm serious - never actually heard of that.
[15:52:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i do.  i don't know that there's a name for that since it's probably not all that common.
[15:52:12] <errorous> then I probably didn't explain well
[15:52:20] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like a 2d carousel.
[15:52:58] <errorous> so, let's say I have 3x3 sections, say divs, on a page. Each one of those sections represent a screen. I just wanna be able to swipe through them, both horizontally and vertically.
[15:53:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:53:37] <robertmaxrees> like a carouself.
[15:53:42] <errorous> or even better yet. you know on most modern pages on mobile, when you swipe down, it just shows different section
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> *carousel
[15:53:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a bad idea heh
[15:53:52] <errorous> just puts the whole section in the viewport
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> hijacking scroll behavior is generally a bad time.
[15:54:07] <errorous> yeah, not my idea tho
[15:54:23] <errorous> like I would ever give myself a task like that
[15:54:30] <robertmaxrees> mindblowing when designers don't consult with devs on stuff like this first.
[15:55:20] <errorous> robertmaxrees swipe navigation!!!
[15:55:23] <errorous> it's a thing
[15:55:24] <errorous> :)
[15:55:28] <robertmaxrees> for vertical stuff sure.
[15:55:32] <errorous> for both
[15:55:38] <errorous> https://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/swipe-page/capetown.html
[15:55:39] <robertmaxrees> but the horizontal+vertical concept i've literally never seen.
[15:55:59] <errorous> yeah, well, I don't really need to sync by row\
[15:56:03] <errorous> so it makes it easier
[15:56:46] <errorous> say that each column is actually a page, with sections as rows. when I swipe left or right, I get the topmost section of said column in viewport
[15:57:01] <robertmaxrees> and that component would be called a full-page carousel in today's terminology.
[15:57:04] <errorous> if I swap vertically I get next/previous section
[15:57:23] <robertmaxrees> since it's just the left/right behavior.
[15:58:11] <errorous> well, it's top/bottom as well
[15:58:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm referring to that jqm example./
[15:58:27] <errorous> oh, ok
[15:58:28] <robertmaxrees> it's the horizontal AND vertical scroll hijacking at the same time that i've never seen.
[16:57:53] <sydbarret>  i dont understand  what line 24 does https://bpa.st/QKKA
[16:58:15] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[16:58:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:58:28] <sydbarret> robert
[16:58:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:58:33] <sydbarret> but where does it bind it?
[16:58:55] <robertmaxrees> look at the code.
[16:59:01] <robertmaxrees> pretty clear where it binds the listener.
[16:59:25] <sydbarret> line 10?
[16:59:30] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[16:59:36] <sydbarret> so should just work without line 24_
[16:59:37] <sydbarret> ?
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> nope :)
[17:00:03] <robertmaxrees> line 24 is removing the event binding and then calling submit again to actually submit the form.
[17:00:27] <robertmaxrees> guessing this is validating an input field on form submit.
[17:01:19] <sydbarret> so is the only way to do it?
[17:01:32] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to do that, but they're a little more complicated.
[17:03:04] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[17:03:05] <sydbarret> but why  $('#ajax_form').submit(); wouldnt work instead of line 24?
[17:03:17] <robertmaxrees> think about it.
[17:03:22] <sydbarret> i thought preventdault stop
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> you call submit on the form without unbinding the event listener.  what would happen?
[17:03:28] <sydbarret> the form for being submit
[17:04:09] <sydbarret> i dont know what an event listener is ? which one is it in this code?
[17:04:18] <sydbarret> the e parameter?
[17:04:22] <robertmaxrees> we just talked about this...
[17:04:24] <robertmaxrees> line 10.
[17:04:30] <robertmaxrees> that's binding an event listener for the submit event.
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> with the event listener, every time the form is submitted, it's stopped to run the validation.  if you call .submit() again without removing the event listener, then it'll just run the validation again.
[17:05:54] <sydbarret> ok thanks
[17:07:35] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/ - this is an excellent resource for learning the basics.  it'll help you to better understand the code.
[19:59:13] <irthewinner> guys, how can I get all texts to array of my ".classItems" ?
[19:59:24] <robertmaxrees> .map().get()
[19:59:44] <robertmaxrees> pass a function to .map() that returns the text of the element.
[19:59:45] <irthewinner> hmm
[20:00:02] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle and we can step through it together :)
[20:00:31] <irthewinner> sec i will upload it mate
[20:00:49] <irthewinner> or wait wait , no need to upload , it's one line
[20:01:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:01:23] <irthewinner> const categories = $('.menu_item_text').text().ToArray();   //// im trying to get each text to array (put it in categories array)
[20:01:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle with some example markup - that's not how you do that.
[20:01:57] <irthewinner> ok sec :D
[20:02:12] <cloud69> Oh hey!
[20:02:17] <cloud69> Anybody know how to make a slider out of this? https://codepen.io/weeeeeeeee/pen/eYddoMN
[20:02:17] <cloud69> The slides have a lot of CSS in them so unfortunately I can't use stuff like https://flickity.metafizzy.co/
[20:03:13] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 huh?
[20:04:25] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 do you mean "how can I make this a carousel without using a plugin"?
[20:04:33] <cloud69> Yes sir
[20:04:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty big question :/
[20:05:01] <cloud69> Damn
[20:05:12] <robertmaxrees> search around online and you'll get the basic idea.
[20:05:24] <cloud69> I can't just use jquery to slide in the first slide, then hide it, move it to the back of the list, and then slide in the next slide?
[20:05:26] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask: why not use a plugin and modify your HTML/CSS to conform to what it needs?
[20:05:37] <robertmaxrees> or, y'know, don't use a carousel since they're generally not a good idea.
[20:05:51] <robertmaxrees> lol yes, you CAN use jquery to do that.  so do it. :)
[20:07:59] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=bxoDjTaQnV
[20:08:07] <irthewinner> here mate , im trying to get this to array
[20:08:25] <cloud69> i have to use one unfortunately. its for this ecommerce site. they all got sliders to show off their latest marketing campaigns :/
[20:09:58] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner mind saving that instead of using togetherjs
[20:09:59] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:10:13] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 lol no, we don't all do them :)_
[20:10:24] <irthewinner> sec
[20:10:30] <cloud69> :D
[20:10:42] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner thanks - togetherjs wigs out and doesn't work half the time.
[20:10:50] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[20:10:55] <cloud69> haha
[20:11:50] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: it makes great points.
[20:12:31] <robertmaxrees> we stopped using them partially because accessibility is a nightmare but also because users are basically blind to them.
[20:12:41] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/cjnsztmw/
[20:12:42] <cloud69> hmmmm
[20:12:48] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: i like what im hearing
[20:13:08] <robertmaxrees> go google it.  you'll see what's up.
[20:13:14] <cloud69> will do!
[20:13:31] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner perfect - so first off - just need the span tags :) https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zrsm25kx/
[20:13:42] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner next up - check out the jquery docs on .map()
[20:13:57] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner this one: https://api.jquery.com/map/
[20:14:04] <irthewinner> robertmaxrees, so I need to pass a map right? ok sec let me check mate
[20:14:18] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:14:21] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i said at all.
[20:14:42] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner use the map method.
[20:14:46] <robertmaxrees> read the docs for more info :)
[20:15:00] <irthewinner> ok im reading :D
[20:22:17] <irthewinner> robertmaxrees, thanks mate :) worked!
[20:22:22] <irthewinner> I did it like this: const categories = $('.menu_item_text').map(function(){return $(this).text();}).get();
[20:24:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:24:05] <robertmaxrees> well done :)
[20:32:06] <irthewinner> btw seems like I cant use jquery array if I wanna call an async function
[20:32:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:32:39] <irthewinner> from the example above, I added:
[20:32:41] <irthewinner> categories.forEach(cat => renderContent(cat));
[20:32:50] <irthewinner> /renderContent is an async function
[20:32:53] <irthewinner> /
[20:33:08] <robertmaxrees> still don't follow.
[20:33:17] <robertmaxrees> categories isn't a jquery object there.
[20:33:19] <robertmaxrees> it's an array.
[20:33:50] <irthewinner> yeah but the strange thing is, if i put normal array like: categories = ['aasdas','bbbb','ccc'];
[20:33:52] <irthewinner> it will work
[20:33:55] <robertmaxrees> and renderContent being async wouldn't do anything weird there.  mind clarifying the issue?  maybe show the code?
[20:34:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, show the actual code in a fiddle then.
[20:34:20] <irthewinner> ok sec mate
[20:35:14] <irthewinner> ah maybe something with the map or get() that breaks it (cuz the console says: "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: categories.each is not a function"
[20:35:19] <irthewinner> sec i will upload code
[20:38:47] <irthewinner> strange, it works on jsfiddle hmm
[20:38:56] <robertmaxrees> did you copy/paste the exact code?
[20:39:00] <robertmaxrees> or recreate it? :)
[20:39:14] <robertmaxrees> 'cause your error and the code you shared here doesn't match.
[20:39:21] <irthewinner> yes mate, it's strange :S works there but not on browser (cuz of promise error)
[20:39:25] <robertmaxrees> are you doing categories.each or categories.forEach
[20:39:34] <irthewinner> categories.forEach
[20:39:47] <robertmaxrees> then dunno.
[20:39:51] <robertmaxrees> would have to see it.
[20:40:46] <irthewinner> but the strange part is: if i put instead of: const categories = $('.menu_item_text').map(function(){return $(this).text();}).get();
[20:40:49] <irthewinner> const categories = ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"];
[20:40:54] <irthewinner> it will work
[20:41:12] <robertmaxrees> console.log(categories.length);
[20:41:15] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[20:41:19] <irthewinner> 3
[20:41:37] <robertmaxrees> with the jquery version?
[20:42:26] <irthewinner> sec let me  check , it's from npm package
[20:42:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:42:38] <robertmaxrees> so confused lol
[20:42:47] <robertmaxrees> that .map().get() combo is giving you an array.
[20:42:54] <irthewinner> i installed it from npm :D sec let me check the version of jquery
[20:43:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:43:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean are you getting 3 with the .map() code?
[20:43:51] <irthewinner> jquery-3.5.1.min.js
[20:43:57] <irthewinner> yes mate getting 3
[20:44:03] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[20:44:22] <robertmaxrees> that error means you're likely running .each on a non-jquery object
[20:44:24] <irthewinner> i think it's something with Promises (ecmascript) that breaks it
[20:44:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:44:50] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($.fn.jquery); in the console
[20:44:59] <robertmaxrees> or rather, in your code.
[20:45:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[20:45:20] <irthewinner> 3.5.1
[20:45:46] <robertmaxrees> so async being in play won't break anything.
[20:45:53] <robertmaxrees> unless you have a race condition going on.
[20:45:58] <robertmaxrees> are there multiple async calls involved here?
[20:46:04] <irthewinner> yes
[20:46:18] <robertmaxrees> heh, mind sharing more code then?
[20:46:30] <irthewinner> ok sec :D
[20:50:38] <irthewinner> hmm the thing is i dunno how to share that code :P but it a function that calls for something in DB, like this: const count = await categoryInfo.getCount(categoryName);
[20:50:45] <irthewinner> this is what categoryInfo is:
[20:50:55] <irthewinner> async get(categoryName, sess) { const data = await $.get(`/${categoryName}/${sess}`); return data; }
[20:51:13] <irthewinner> i mean this code async getCount(categoryName) {
[20:51:40] <robertmaxrees> please paste that in a fiddle.
[20:51:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of in the channel.
[20:51:54] <irthewinner> jsfiddle will handle the DB related stuff? ok sec i will try
[20:51:59] <irthewinner> i mean ajax calls
[20:52:00] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have to function.
[20:52:05] <robertmaxrees> just need to see the code itself.
[20:52:12] <irthewinner> ah sec
[20:54:29] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/cjnsztmw/
[20:54:50] <robertmaxrees> that's the same code as before?
[20:54:51] <irthewinner> ops wait , wrong link :P
[20:55:46] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/cjnsztmw/1/
[20:56:05] <robertmaxrees> mw/
[20:56:05] <robertmaxrees> [2020:12:10:17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> that's the same code as
[20:56:07] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[20:56:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6k5u32bx/
[20:56:25] <robertmaxrees> there we go - your html was invalid in the example fwiw.
[20:57:08] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: it won't change anything but you can replace that last line with just categories.forEach(cat); :)
[20:57:33] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing with renderContent?
[20:58:03] <robertmaxrees> that return, i mean.
[20:58:13] <irthewinner> call ajax from a class and rendering html data depends on results from DB
[20:58:30] <robertmaxrees> so in this code, you just return out of renderContent, which doesn't make sense.
[20:58:34] <robertmaxrees> can you show me more context?
[20:59:02] <irthewinner> i extracted it from the class (it's a return from class to function)  yeah should be return from class to that function
[20:59:14] <robertmaxrees> "return from class"??
[20:59:16] <irthewinner> ok sec
[20:59:23] <robertmaxrees> there's something here that doesn't make sense.
[20:59:26] <irthewinner> i will put the whole code
[20:59:40] <robertmaxrees> so long as we're not talking, like, a thousand lines, sure :)
[21:04:19] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/cjnsztmw/2/
[21:04:52] <robertmaxrees> lol you know what i'm going to tell you about that HTML pane ;)
[21:06:06] <robertmaxrees> if you run this code, just like this (with that unknown code removed), do you still get the error?
[21:06:19] <irthewinner> yes mate
[21:06:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jn810bsm/ with the invalid html removed./
[21:06:35] <irthewinner> it says something about promises
[21:06:44] <robertmaxrees> right, we're tracking down why.
[21:06:46] <irthewinner> Uncaught (in promise)
[21:06:52] <robertmaxrees> correctr.
[21:06:54] <robertmaxrees> *correct.
[21:07:09] <robertmaxrees> we're trying to figure out where in this process things are falling apart.
[21:07:20] <robertmaxrees> i am very clear that it says "in promise".  i can read ;)
[21:07:47] <robertmaxrees> how is a_function_runs_on_page_load called?
[21:08:47] <irthewinner> it's getting called from an async function that runs on page load
[21:08:58] <irthewinner> a function that checks if user is logged in and stuff like that
[21:09:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jn810bsm/1/
[21:09:07] <robertmaxrees> irthewinner what happens if you do this?
[21:09:26] <robertmaxrees> sorry, this https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jn810bsm/2/
[21:09:46] <robertmaxrees> do you get foo or bar?
[21:09:51] <irthewinner> to remove the const categories = ? etc
[21:09:58] <irthewinner> sec let me check
[21:10:00] <robertmaxrees> see second fddle.
[21:10:01] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[21:10:13] <robertmaxrees> i accidentally left that jquery line out.
[21:11:07] <irthewinner> ah i get foo
[21:11:11] <irthewinner> dont get bar
[21:11:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so our issue is likely inside getCount.
[21:12:33] <robertmaxrees> any networking console errors?
[21:12:38] <irthewinner> ok sec let me check what I have there
[21:13:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if you're padding in strings padded with whitespace or other issues.
[21:13:55] <irthewinner> hmm no network errors
[21:14:24] <robertmaxrees> okay.  replace that 'foo' with categoryName
[21:14:31] <irthewinner> wait , maybe because im using more than async function inside the renderContent function?
[21:14:42] <irthewinner> im using 2 there (awaits)
[21:14:56] <robertmaxrees> is the console.log('bar') after both of them?
[21:15:00] <robertmaxrees> or just the first one?
[21:15:11] <irthewinner> the first one runs
[21:15:15] <irthewinner> the second not running
[21:15:20] <robertmaxrees> ...
[21:15:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kl
[21:15:28] <robertmaxrees> i can't help you if i'm not looking at the same thing, so.
[21:16:09] <irthewinner> ok i will remove everything and run only the Count and test
[21:16:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jn810bsm/3/ do something like this.
[21:16:43] <robertmaxrees> comment out the rest of renderContent :)
[21:17:19] <irthewinner> oh i commented all and now exactly like the jsfiddle code
[21:17:24] <irthewinner> still not working yeah, strange
[21:17:34] <robertmaxrees> ok.  so what's 'categoryName' in your console?
[21:17:35] <irthewinner> if i put other await call it will work
[21:17:41] <irthewinner> let me check whats inside the count
[21:19:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, totally lost at this point lol
[21:20:11] <irthewinner> yeah :D ok sec mate
[21:20:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not really giving me anything to work with.  taking stabs in the dark.  the issue is clearly that get call not doing what you think it's doing, so i'm guessing you're giving it something it isn't expecting.
[21:22:24] <robertmaxrees> you could zero in even further on that by adding console.logs before/after that $.get
[21:22:36] <irthewinner> https://jsfiddle.net/vh213yqt/
[21:22:40] <irthewinner> this is the strange part:
[21:22:45] <irthewinner> i see console log of:
[21:22:52] <irthewinner> foo and a
[21:23:38] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so getCount is seeing something it doesn't expect.
[21:24:00] <irthewinner> maybe it's something about mongodb count documents?
[21:24:32] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i can't really speculate because i have no frame of reference to code I can't see, the rest of your stack, etc.
[21:24:40] <robertmaxrees> what's the change you make this get this to function?
[21:25:01] <robertmaxrees> the one where you declare the array directly.
[21:25:33] <irthewinner> if i put array directly it will work :S
[21:25:42] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[21:26:07] <irthewinner> i mean like this for example const categories = ['aaa','bbb','ccc']; with the same code above
[21:26:34] <irthewinner> this will work but if i use: const categories = $('.menu_item_text').map(function(){return $(this).text();}).get();
[21:26:39] <irthewinner> i get promise errors
[21:27:12] <robertmaxrees> 'k well
[21:27:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/170vz9th/
[21:27:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess your html differs in some meaningful way, or there's some other js in play that you're not showing me.
[21:28:02] <irthewinner> i will uncomment the code inside "count" and see if it will work , sec
[21:29:38] <robertmaxrees> also might be worth checking to see what those get calls are even returning.
[21:29:42] <robertmaxrees> make sure those are doing what you expect.
[21:31:05] <irthewinner> weird thing :S i removed everything from that getCount method (in class)
[21:31:09] <irthewinner> still not working
[21:31:13] <irthewinner> but works for other methods
[21:31:21] <irthewinner> maybe the name is not good? sec let me check
[21:31:36] <irthewinner> like:
[21:31:38] <irthewinner> await categoryInfo.get
[21:31:39] <irthewinner> works
[21:31:41] <irthewinner> await categoryInfo.getCount
[21:31:43] <irthewinner> not working
[21:31:58] <robertmaxrees> then $.get(`/count/${categoryName}`); is the issue.
[21:32:09] <irthewinner> oh
[21:32:36] <robertmaxrees> that api endpoint may be breaking on whatever you feed it
[21:33:35] <irthewinner> hmm ok i will do some console logs there and check what breaking it
[21:34:05] <robertmaxrees> could also look at the request in the network tab and see what the request url and response body are.
[21:49:21] <irthewinner> im investigating the issue
[21:50:43] <robertmaxrees> have you checked to see what you're passing into the get?
[21:50:54] <irthewinner> oh i think i know whats wrong there
[21:50:55] <irthewinner> dam
[21:51:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[21:51:11] <irthewinner> it's because of uppercase >_<
[21:51:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:51:26] <irthewinner> the strings there, im dealing with lowercase
[21:51:35] <irthewinner> but i forgot to lowercase them
[21:51:42] <irthewinner> damn /facepalm :P
[21:51:45] <robertmaxrees> this is why showing the markup, etc as-is is important.
[21:51:47] <robertmaxrees> but okie.
[21:51:55] <irthewinner> thanks alot for the help mate :D
[21:51:56] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[21:52:11] <irthewinner> robertmaxrees, you're the real MVP :D
[21:52:21] <robertmaxrees> just pointing you in the right direction :)
