[04:20:28] <Kraas> Hi, is it possible to keep a string of html as is when converting it to a jQuery object? See this https://jsfiddle.net/p28z4wjs/1/ the data attribute quotes changes for example.
[04:31:00] <Cork> Kraas: the dom has specific syntax and the html string isn't kept
[04:31:21] <Cork> the html you get out is generated from the dom structure and no you can't choose how it will look
[04:32:03] <Cork> Kraas: you can just html entity encode the " if you want to use them in a " element though
[04:32:29] <bigLanky> https://jsfiddle.net/onkLh2z6/
[04:33:09] <bigLanky> right now I have 5 questions/select options... 1 and 2 are simple yes/no... #3 only shows up if #1 is set to Yes and #4 only shows up if #2 is set to yes
[04:33:10] <Cork> Kraas: https://jsfiddle.net/p28z4wjs/2/
[04:33:33] <bigLanky> #the problem I can't figure out is how to get #5 to show when both 1 AND 2 are selected as Yes
[04:34:59] <Cork> bigLanky: i would prob add a class to all elements that other select elements depend on
[04:35:16] <Cork> and when any of them changes grab all of them and feed them to showSelectDependents
[04:35:28] <Cork> and then just go over each one of them and make sure they are xyz
[04:35:54] <Cork> (also i would prob use classes on the depentent elements so you don't have to have hardcoded elements in the showSelectDependents)
[04:36:19] <bigLanky> ah ok that makes sense
[04:36:30] <Kraas> Cork: I see. Unfortunately I don't have control of the markup. Thanks for answering though :)
[04:36:37] <bigLanky> so I would toggle #1, then scan all selects, see only #1 is selected
[04:36:41] <Cork> bigLanky: something like <select name="question3" class="dependent question1 yes">
[04:36:56] <bigLanky> then, when #2 is also set to yes, a check runs that sees that #1 is set to yes and #2 are set to yes
[04:37:11] <Cork> and then you can just do $('.depentent.question1:not(.yes)').hide()
[04:37:31] <Cork> and $('.depentent.question1.yes').show()
[04:37:54] <Cork> where the last class is question1.val()
[04:38:23] <bigLanky> so what about when I have this
[04:38:34] <bigLanky> <select name="question5" class="dependent question1 question2 yes">
[04:38:53] <Cork> hmm on second thought it would have to be <select name="question3" class="dependent question1 question1-yes"> ...
[04:39:11] <bigLanky> ah ok
[04:39:19] <bigLanky> that would work
[04:39:29] <Cork> might be better to do <select name="question5" class="depentent" data-question1="yes" data-question2="no">
[04:39:50] <bigLanky> so I could grab all class names for questionX, then check to make sure there is a correspoding class of questionX-yes for all
[04:40:10] <Cork> then you can do $('.dependent[data-question1]:not([data-queston1="yes"]')
[04:40:10] <bigLanky> ah yeah I like that better too
[04:40:36] <Cork> you can itterate on this many levels
[04:40:42] <bigLanky> yeah
[04:40:52] <Cork> but ya i would put the relevant data in the elements and keep the js code dumb
[04:40:55] <bigLanky> so qhen question1 is toggled to Yes, how do I update the data-question1 param?
[04:41:05] <Cork> you don't
[04:41:25] <Cork> what you do is "this element depends on question1=<dependent value>"
[04:41:29] <bigLanky> so data-question1 pulls the actual value of select name='question1' ?
[04:41:39] <Cork> so when question1 changes you find all dependents and update them
[04:42:20] <bigLanky> yeah so by default it will be data-question1="no" but then how do I update it to yes
[04:42:23] <Cork> you can run a each loop over the $('.dependencies') and grab there name and value
[04:42:30] <Cork> no, you don't get it
[04:42:47] <Cork> ex 5 depends on that question1 is yes and question2 is yes and question 4 is no
[04:43:15] <bigLanky> ok yeah I get that
[04:43:21] <Cork> that would be <select name="question5" class="dependent" data-question1="yes" data-question="yes" data-question4="no">
[04:43:33] <bigLanky> ok
[04:43:41] <Cork> the decition is in the change event for the dependency select element
[04:44:10] <Cork> hope that makes a bit of sense
[04:44:47] <bigLanky> so that would be the original rendering?
[04:45:02] <Cork> it would be statically in the html ya
[04:45:13] <bigLanky> then what happens when i toggle question1 to yes or to no? do those values update in the select element
[04:45:58] <bigLanky> or would I use the JS to check to make sure question1=yes, question2=yes, question4=no
[04:49:24] <Cork> bigLanky: something like this https://jsfiddle.net/onkLh2z6/2/
[04:52:58] <bigLanky> which elements would get class="dependency" ?
[04:53:12] <bigLanky> question 1 and 2?
[04:53:19] <Cork> bigLanky: the elements other select elements depend on
[04:53:43] <Cork> it is just an optimization, you can just use 'select' if you want all to be considered
[05:07:12] <bigLanky> Cork
[05:07:12] <bigLanky> https://jsfiddle.net/onkLh2z6/7/
[05:07:19] <bigLanky> i might be missing something here
[05:07:36] <bigLanky> my alert in the .each(data, function.. section is not getting called
[05:09:32] <Cork> bigLanky: ya, <select name="question3" class="dependent question1 yes"> is meant to be <select name="question3" class="dependent" data-question1="yes">
[05:09:49] <bigLanky> oh ok wasnt sure if we were still using that format
[05:09:49] <Cork> actually case sensitive so <select name="question3" class="dependent" data-question1="Yes">
[05:10:40] <Cork> bigLanky: $(this).data() grabs all the data-* attributes on the select element
[05:11:08] <Cork> bigLanky: if you don't want to occupy all the data attributes you can use data-question="<json object>"
[05:11:15] <Cork> it would just be a slight change
[05:12:18] <Cork> that would be <select data-question="{&#x22;question1&#x22;:&#x22;Yes&#x22;}"> instead of data-question1="Yes"
[05:29:37] <bigLanky> getting close
[05:29:37] <bigLanky> https://jsfiddle.net/onkLh2z6/20/
[05:29:51] <bigLanky> line 11 of the JS is causing all fields to change
[05:32:52] <bigLanky> here we go - https://jsfiddle.net/onkLh2z6/21/
[05:33:09] <bigLanky> so now #5 is only showing when question1 is true
[06:09:37] <pascal> Hi   ,
[06:11:58] <pascal> Why mousemove event doesn't works on mobile browser? How to solve? I've tried $(document).on("mousemove touchmove", function(e){
[06:15:04] <oded> I'm trying to run the test suite. I tried grunt test as well as grunt watch, which seem to run the tests. However - I changed the tests to fail and they still succeed, what am I doing wrong?
[06:16:06] <oded> Maybe that's to go in #jquery-dev
[06:16:33] <oded> supposed to go*
[06:53:35] <oded> Nothing?
[07:07:47] <sonu_nk> https://pastebin.com/hrd2v5XA i want to set a flag after ajax true but seems some issue... flag not set and not working
[07:09:02] <Cork> sonu_nk: ajax is async so you can't run things "after"
[07:09:13] <Cork> use the .done() callback
[07:10:12] <sonu_nk> so no need to work with Success : ????
[07:10:22] <sonu_nk> should it replace with .done ()
[07:10:23] <sonu_nk> ?
[07:17:04] <sonu_nk> Cork, actually issue is :  i have two fields first one is optional.. but it should valid.. so i am checking first one field value with ajax.. if ajax says its true then next process should work.. its not required that both should exist..any one or two can exist..
[07:17:41] <Cork> sonu_nk: use $.when then
[07:18:05] <Cork> then you can send both ajax calls at the same time, and then validate both when all are done
[07:18:44] <Cork> it can event handle dynamic number of ajax calls
[07:19:35] <sonu_nk> but the first field is option. it will only check if its present only,....
[07:19:42] <Cork> sure
[07:19:43] <sonu_nk> now $.when is ok for this ?
[07:20:37] <Cork> var validators = []; if(something) { validators.push($.ajax); } $(somethingElse) { validators.push($.ajax); } $.when.apply(null, validators).done(function() {})
[07:21:10] <Cork> dune will be called when all the ajax calls in validators has completed
[07:21:52] <Cork> don't remember the format of the arguments, but the responses are in there in arrays if i remember correctly
[07:22:38] <Dro> hello, i want to add an onclick action for a button so it go to an url indicated in the value of a radio button.. how can I do that please?
[07:23:48] <Cork> Dro: you can't really do that, if you can add a <a> tag around the button and update its href that is normally better
[07:24:02] <Cork> Dro: you can simulate some of it by doing window.location = new url
[07:24:18] <Cork> but it won't support the normal open in tab and so on browsers normally support
[07:25:16] <Cork> an alternative is to style an a tag to look like a button and have the radio button replace the href value when changed
[07:25:29] <Cork> THAT is prob the best option if you can go there
[07:31:49] <Dro> Cork, for the <a> how can I get the value of the radio button ?
[07:31:58] <Dro> to add it in the href ?
[07:44:11] <Cork> Dro: $('input[type="radio"]').on('change', function() { $('a').attr('href', this.value); });
[07:44:29] <Cork> the a tag would not need any separate js code
[07:58:40] <oded> Anyone knows how to run jQuery tests?
[08:49:00] <JrWebDev> whats the opposite effect of $("#id").prop("disabled", true);  how do i remove disabled true or re-enable?
[08:51:12] <JrWebDev> nevermind i got it
[10:10:40] <MikeD_> haha, what is the opposite of true?
[10:28:49] <Cork> MikeD_: yup, i found that one really funny too
[10:56:23] <zenox> i'm trying to append some rows into a tab in a certain place, so i thought i'd put a div as a wrapper where i want to place the rows, but they're appearing outside the table - is this right?
[11:03:43] <Cork> zenox: yes, tables can't contains anything except thead, tbody, tfoot and tr
[11:05:41] <zenox> ah that'd make sense, thanks Cork
[11:52:38] <VX> im trying to add some userscript functionality to a timesheet application, when you add a time in a date square, the fields in the bottom get activated, but it seems their values are stored in variables, the script it minized and extensive, how can i find where the values would be, for instance, the typed text "Some Content" http://pasteboard.co/veZZxMQG.png
[12:01:35] <zenox> VX, you ask an impossible question!
[12:02:48] <VX> thats what they said to Charles Babbage
[12:03:56] <robertmaxrees> VX you said these values are store in variables somewhere?
[12:04:07] <VX> what i am wondering is say in chrome, if i set a break point, and view local variables, is there a way to filter so i can see the variable with the content matched ? or even run something against the variables
[12:04:43] <VX> robertmaxrees im trying to find the code that is affecting the bahavior, of that interface, not having much luck
[12:04:45] <robertmaxrees> "filter so i can see the variable with the content matched" as in...
[12:04:48] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[12:05:45] <robertmaxrees> well, is any of the code bound to an event handler?
[12:06:30] <VX> im sure, but i cant find it, doesnt help that the code is minimized
[12:06:40] <zenox> finding the variables is one thing - doing something with them isanother because the code is minified
[12:07:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:07:37] <robertmaxrees> so what are you planning on doing after finding it?
[12:08:33] <VX> robertmaxrees some entries are recurring, have the same information etc, i want to automate the process to speed up entry
[12:09:17] <robertmaxrees> but you won't have access to those vars outside of the handlers.
[12:10:20] <VX> it seems that each time square has a set of variables, so when you select it, it populates the inputs at the bottom
[12:10:54] <robertmaxrees> okay - and if you can't access those variables from outside those handlers, how do you expect to work with them?
[12:11:49] <VX> lets cross one bridge at a time ;)
[12:11:55] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[12:11:57] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/v4wcpymx/
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> try changing someVar outside of that function.
[12:14:04] <robertmaxrees> even better: https://jsfiddle.net/v4wcpymx/2/
[12:14:42] <VX> robertmaxrees thanks
[12:14:57] <robertmaxrees> so try to modify someVar and thing have that handler print out the new value.
[12:15:12] <robertmaxrees> without changing anything within the function.
[12:17:09] <VX> robertmaxrees i believe you, you had me at "try changing someVar outside of that function"
[12:17:33] <robertmaxrees> so really your challenge is to find a different result to solve that problem :)

[12:22:24] <Violinist> wow
[12:22:50] <Violinist> i almost could not find a bug
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:23:56] <Violinist> u dont want to know
[12:24:00] <Violinist> believe
[12:24:01] <Violinist> me
[12:24:11] <robertmaxrees> uh, okay?
[12:33:42] <JrWebDev> i have multiple div's coming from a foreach loop (each with inputboxes and a button), how do i grab data from within this div such as the element input with id="inputbox" from within this div when i clic... input box with id=input, $('#id').val()  when i tell jquery $('#id').val() it always gives me the first iterations value...if this where a btn click it would be easy...just $('btn').click(function() { $(this).value() }); but how do i dig
[12:33:42] <JrWebDev> further
[12:36:40] <JrWebDev> is it possible to do a $(this).$('#id').val() ?
[12:38:04] <jugglinmike> JrWebDev: use the `find` method
[12:38:14] <jugglinmike> as in $(this).find('#id').val()
[12:38:25] <JrWebDev> let me see if that works
[12:42:46] <JrWebDev> its not really working
[12:43:33] <JrWebDev> does the search go up in code
[12:43:54] <JrWebDev> jugglinmike,
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev first off - .find('#id') doesn't really make sense.
[12:44:33] <robertmaxrees> you should only ever have one element with a given ID.
[12:45:07] <JrWebDev> im actually using a class not an id...so find('.id')
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> and .find() doesn't go "up", it goes "down".
[12:45:32] <JrWebDev> dang
[12:45:46] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us your html?
[12:45:48] <JrWebDev> so technically i would have to put my button above the code
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic question?
[12:46:08] <JrWebDev> i guess
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.  sounds like you just need to develop some familiarity :) go to https://jsfiddle.net/ and paste the html into the html box.
[12:47:03] <JrWebDev> ok let me draft up this as simple as possible in jsfiddle
[12:50:17] <JrWebDev> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/gyewcxqe/
[12:50:29] <robertmaxrees> err...
[12:50:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:50:30] <JrWebDev> its a php for loop
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> so toss in multiple inputs
[12:51:15] <JrWebDev> yeah all within their own divs with padding of course around them..forgot to put div
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> do multipoles to make the markup more indicative :)
[12:52:08] <JrWebDev> what do you mean robertmaxrees
[12:52:50] <JrWebDev> so yeah each input will have a button...when i click that button i want to see the input value for that inputbox associated within that div
[12:53:11] <JrWebDev> i mean i wanna see the input value associated with that button
[12:53:29] <robertmaxrees> could you add the relevant div and stuff then?
[12:53:41] <JrWebDev> well i mean its simple
[12:53:46] <JrWebDev> hold on
[12:53:47] <robertmaxrees> like, does each button/input combo have a single div?
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> or does one div hold all of them,?
[12:54:11] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/gyewcxqe/2/
[12:54:25] <JrWebDev> each has within its own div
[12:54:52] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/gyewcxqe/3/
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> so I'd stick a class on those divs called something like input_group and then use .closest() to get there, then .find() to get the input.
[12:55:31] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/4pQTb/ - how would I change this back to input=number on submit?
[12:55:44] <JrWebDev> okay heres my example with the div having a name
[12:55:46] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/gyewcxqe/3/
[12:55:47] <impliednude> or input=text
[12:56:01] <JrWebDev> div class="div_container"
[12:56:42] <JrWebDev> so $(this).closest('.div_container').find('.country').val()
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev yep.  use a better name for that div tho.
[12:57:09] <robertmaxrees> use something that actually describes that content.
[12:57:16] <JrWebDev> okay
[12:57:23] <JrWebDev> well let me see if that code works though
[12:57:27] <robertmaxrees> you said you have multiples of these?
[12:57:31] <JrWebDev> yes
[12:57:36] <JrWebDev> a for each loop spitting them out
[12:57:44] <JrWebDev> so all divs will have the same class name
[12:58:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/gyewcxqe/4/
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> works fine ;)
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> and will all those buttons have show_country_btn as a class?
[12:58:23] <JrWebDev> yup
[12:58:39] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/4pQTb/22/ = I need to change this back on submit so that way it retains its values. Basically client wants to choose between drop down or input=numbers. Please assist. Thank you and blessings
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> impliednude bind a submit handler and change .prop('type', 'whateveryouwant');
[13:00:47] <robertmaxrees> impliednude though I gotta ask - why do you want that?
[13:01:25] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> I am working on the ui for a existing module for wordpress that's not mine. the company wants it "yesterday" and my work is complying.
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> impliednude you realize that the dropdowns should post to the server the same way, right?
[13:02:05] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> they do?
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> they should...
[13:02:36] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> thing is the drop downs dont have name="productsToAdd[4254][quantity] as part of the updated dom
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> do the original inputs?
[13:03:36] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> yep. which is confusing me
[13:03:49] <robertmaxrees> sopoo why not copy them over?
[13:03:56] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> check the code on jsfiddle and I don't know how >.>
[13:04:06] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> truth be told not a ui type person. just php
[13:04:26] <impliednude> so js is abstract and mainly copypasting
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you just copy those names over, it'll work fine.
[13:04:52] <impliednude> how would you copy the names and other attributes over to that select conversion
[13:05:00] <robertmaxrees> just like you do with the ID.
[13:05:40] <impliednude> ahh
[13:05:44] <impliednude> okay :) thank you
[13:05:49] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[13:06:00] <robertmaxrees> that should post the exact same way as the text inputs.
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> so you should be fine.
[13:06:07] <JrWebDev> perfect robertmaxrees
[13:06:09] <impliednude> awesomesauce

[19:29:57] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/d911380cf3a030869012900b9d44e5c0
[19:30:35] <Darmani> This kinda works, but for some reason it only works on certain comment containers? On others it never reaches the bottom (even if I'm at the bottom).
[19:51:52] <bjsnider> i was working on a reset button for a half hour, and it looked like it should work, and the console output was correct, but it wasn't working. that's when i remembered that pesky event.preventdefault
