[07:54:28] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:55:23] <jak2000> rindolf!
[07:56:24] <rindolf> jak2000!
[08:42:15] <jak2000> jquery, how to: wich recommend me for disable Enter key of all the form? (and the F5, alt+F4) ?
[10:45:14] <sonja> ionic? phonegap? meteor? what are people using nowadays to publish a html/css/js app on smartdevices?
[11:15:28] <Jittler> Q: Working on a WordPress site and there's a plugin I'm trying to replace the click handler code for. It looks like this: $( 'body' ).on( 'click', {CLASS OF TARGET}, function(){ and I'd like to disable that function. I'm sure it's just a single-line thing with .off() but I can't seem to pass the right arguments. I also tried removing the click handler from the target with no success.
[11:15:51] <Jittler> It's not named or anything, so I'm lost on how to specifically target that function.
[11:21:42] <Elyx`Aw> Jittler > $('body').off('click',function(){});
[11:22:15] <Elyx`Aw> But store your on 2nd parameter in a variable
[11:22:18] <Elyx`Aw> and send the same to off
[11:22:47] <Jittler> Right, but I can't modify the .on() because it's inside a plugin and when the plugin updates, it will be overwritten.
[11:23:04] <Jittler> So I have to manage this without any form of variable.. just the signature as it is.
[11:25:18] <Elyx`Aw> $( "p" ).off( "click", "**" ); ?
[11:25:48] <jak2000> best way for saving data, preventing the user close chrome? cookies?
[11:28:07] <Elyx`Aw> Depends on size of the data
[11:28:08] <shoky> Jittler: $('body').off('click', {CLASS OF TARGET})
[11:28:52] <Jittler> I actually have that currently with no effect. I'm trying to find out if it's because my snippet is being ran before the plugin.
[11:29:05] <jak2000> mmmmm so so characters, 500 characters... (a invoice so so)
[11:31:00] <Jittler> Is there something that immediately follows $(document).ready()?
[11:31:16] <shoky> immediately?
[11:31:20] <shoky> something?
[11:31:58] <shoky> another $(document).ready, i suppose
[11:32:31] <Jittler> No, I'm about to try $(window).load() .. I meant is there an event that fires after ready() that I can hook my .off() to so I don't have to go digging into WP priorities to make sure it runs after the plugin's .on()
[11:32:34] <Jittler> Will report back, brb.
[11:32:57] <shoky> window.load follows yes. hardly immediately
[11:36:50] <Jittler> Yeah, that did it. Ended up structured like this (including WP's required no-conflict wrapper):  jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $(window).load(function() {...$( 'body' ).off( 'click', {TARGET});
[11:38:22] <shoky> don't need the window.load to be inside document.ready
[11:41:50] <sonja> PhoneGap vs Ionic?
[12:13:38] <Rcmainak> hello! everyone.
[12:14:10] <Rcmainak> is it right place to ask questions about jQuery validation plugin??
[12:15:24] <Rcmainak> I think there is a minor bug in validation plugin. Need HELP.
[12:22:36] <lambada355> hello I need calendar plugin. User can select only 1 week and week start friday to saturday
[12:27:19] <DanielDC> hey guys i got some object that i look in it , inside the loop i $.each(data,function(key,value){ value.test = 1 }); now if i gout out of the loop and console.log(data) i have that value.test = 1 inside of it , even those i set it just inside the loop, more then that, even if i save the data on a new varible var data1 = data; and loop on that data1 object and set the test inside it , when i
[12:27:19] <DanielDC> console.log(data) i have the test element inside.
[12:27:23] <DanielDC> anyone can explain it to me ?
[12:28:00] <rindolf> lambada355: I REcall finding a nice Calendar widget (not jQuery-related I think) but i'm not sure it can do that.
[12:29:22] <lambada355> what ?
[12:30:54] <shoky> DanielDC: inside the loop,  value is a reference to the actual item in your data array. so if you change its properties, they will really change
[12:31:17] <rindolf> Rcmainak: hi.
[12:31:24] <rindolf> Rcmainak: it is a good place i think.
[12:31:57] <shoky> DanielDC: same thing if you do:   for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {  var value = data[i];   value.test = 1;  }
[12:32:08] <lambada355> I can select week but when I changed first day, calendar is crash
[12:32:40] <DanielDC> http://jsfiddle.net/xpsqrpy5/4/
[12:32:58] <DanielDC> but i saved the original data on a new VAR
[12:33:16] <shoky> DanielDC: you didn't save the data, you just copied a reference to the same data
[12:33:18] <DanielDC> so if i made change on the old var why its changes the copy of it
[12:33:22] <DanielDC> i see
[12:33:26] <DanielDC> so how do i clone it
[12:33:26] <DanielDC> ?
[12:34:42] <lambada355> If first day is sunday, there isnt problem but when I changed first day sunday to friday, I cant select week correctly
[12:34:42] <shoky> $.extend is one way
[12:35:07] <Rcmainak> rindolf: I'm using the validation plugin but it does not provide any way to verify the address in a form. Am I doing it wrong???
[12:35:13] <DanielDC> what about .clone()
[12:35:19] <DanielDC> is that the same?
[12:35:29] <shoky> no, .clone() is for DOM elements
[12:35:34] <DanielDC> ohh i see
[12:35:40] <DanielDC> so how does that extend works ?
[12:35:41] <rindolf> Rcmainak: what kind of address?
[12:35:44] <DanielDC> var data = ?
[12:36:39] <DanielDC> jQuery.extend({}, data); i guess
[12:37:01] <shoky> yes, or  $.extend(true, {}, data)   if you want a deep copy
[12:37:30] <DanielDC> deep copy means?
[12:37:47] <Rcmainak> rindolf: company or home address. Actually it accepts special charters part of the address which is okay. but if I type +++--*//*/*- in the address field it does not throw any error message.
[12:38:11] <shoky> means it's a recursive copy, it clones each property, and for each property that is an object, it also recursively clones its properties, and so on
[12:38:23] <rindolf> Rcmainak: ah, interesting.
[12:38:43] <DanielDC> thats good then
[12:38:44] <rindolf> Rcmainak: where is the source of the plugin?
[12:38:53] <shoky> it's good, for some purposes :P
[12:39:37] <Rcmainak> rindolf: Should I open a new Issue in github repository.
[12:39:57] <DanielDC> thanks bro!
[12:40:01] <lambada355> http://jsfiddle.net/manishma/AVZJh/light/  it is perfect  but I cant change first day to friday  http://jsfiddle.net/r73yho9w/ like that
[12:40:10] <lambada355> how can change first day friday?
[12:40:22] <rindolf> Rcmainak: please let me take a look to see if i can spot an obvious problem.
[12:40:25] <shoky> np DanielDC
[12:43:23] <Rcmainak> rindolf: Is there any mailing list for jQuery community like mozilla have for its contributors.!!
[12:43:57] <rindolf> Rcmainak: there may be . I know there are web forums and also stackoverflow.com .
[12:44:29] <rindolf> Rcmainak: why aren't you compliant with my request?
[12:44:44] <rindolf> s/compliant/complying/
[12:57:49] <Rcmainak> rindolf: I don't know what compliant does.
[12:58:50] <rindolf> Rcmainak: I asked for a link to this plugin's source code.
[13:00:34] <Rcmainak> rindolf: I'm using the official jQuery validation plugin.
[13:01:12] <rindolf> Rcmainak: what makes it "official"? Which one is it - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jquery%20validation%20plugin ?
[13:02:10] <Rcmainak> the first one. jqueryvalidation.org
[13:10:07] <rindolf> Rcmainak: can you post a reproducing example?
[13:17:38] <lambada355> hello http://jsfiddle.net/r73yho9w/ how can select 1 week 1 line ?
[13:38:25] <lambada355> http://jsfiddle.net/m35ztb5r/ how can select from friday to saturday in 1 line ?
[13:38:29] <rindolf> Oh, Rcmainak left.
[13:39:16] <lambada355> who can help me
[13:39:40] <lambada355> I need like that http://jsfiddle.net/manishma/AVZJh/light/ but start from friday
[14:02:16] <Xgc> lambada355: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-firstDay
[14:18:36] <lambada355> Xgc I can change first day but if I change first day to friday, cant select 1 line week
[14:18:46] <lambada355> http://jsfiddle.net/r73yho9w/ look please
[14:18:58] <lambada355> I want select 14 to 20
[14:19:04] <lambada355> inline
[14:19:14] <lambada355> like that http://jsfiddle.net/manishma/AVZJh/light/
[14:19:37] <Xgc> lambada355: That's a bug.  Report it.
[14:21:01] <lambada355> how can report it
[14:21:14] <Xgc> lambada355: Yell at the author.
[14:21:25] <lambada355> jquery ui ?
[14:21:33] <Xgc> lambada355: I would think so. Yes.
[14:22:10] <lambada355> hmm how can I do ?
[14:22:18] <lambada355> another plugin or idea ?
[14:22:32] <Xgc> lambada355: Also, grab the source and offer a fix.  That might be helpful.
[14:24:09] <lambada355> I am writing bug to github
[14:32:19] <Xgc> lambada355: datepicker seems to refer to some ISO standard for determining the week.  So even if you want to show weeks starting on Friday, when you select a specific day, datepicker may be returning the associated ISO week, not your defined week.
[14:34:43] <Xgc> lambada355: It's possible you can override that behavior directly by adjusting calculateWeek to use your function, instead of this: calculateWeek: this.iso8601Week, // How to calculate the week of the year
[14:35:33] <lambada355> select week function :             $('.week-picker').find('.ui-datepicker-current-day a').addClass('ui-state-active') ?
[14:35:54] <lambada355> help me please
[14:35:57] <lambada355> I cant do it
[14:38:38] <Xgc> lambada355: Could be a separate plug-in just for week-picker.
[14:39:48] <lambada355> hmm
[14:42:51] <lambada355> how can do it
[14:42:57] <Xgc> lambada355: This is probably the line of interest: startDate = new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate() - date.getDay());
[14:43:10] <acidjazz> STARDATE
[14:46:46] <Xgc> lambada355: Just grab that plug-in and adjust the logic to use your start day of week, not just date.getDay().  That's probably accessible via the datepicker plugin.

[18:32:32] <Cheabred> some one help me figure out why a dynamicly added thing will not work with .click() ?
[18:32:32] <Cheabred> https://jsfiddle.net/m4ubvhqf/4/
[18:49:43] <Max-P> Cheabred: it works, it's just that it doesn't exist yet when you call .click(), so you bind click on nothing
[18:50:17] <Max-P> Add the .click() before the .appendTo() and it will work
[19:01:52] <Cheabred> so just swap the functions locations ?
[19:02:31] <Cheabred> so do i need to have the button hidden and then change it to visible instead of adding it ?
[19:16:05] <Cheabred> alright, thanks for the help Max-P :D got it working knowing that i needed to have the element there before it loads XD
[19:16:27] <Cheabred> its been a LONG time since i have done jquery haha :D
[19:16:39] <Max-P> Cheabred: It doesn't matter if the element is in the page or not, as long as it exists somewhere
[19:17:26] <Max-P> $('#add_more_options') just scans the page for an element with id="add_more_options" and .click adds the event handler to them all
[19:18:08] <Max-P> So you can make it invisible if you want, but you don't have to. Your $('<i ...') creates one, and you can use it to add a click handler to it
[20:10:19] <rom1504> anyone know how to add anchors to a jquery datatable (so that I can give a link to someone and it would scroll to the correct line) ?
[20:10:53] <rom1504> my current page : http://prismarinejs.github.io/minecraft-data/
[20:34:15] <rom1504> well I managed to add anchors link in cells
[20:34:27] <rom1504> but it doesn't go to that anchor somehow
[20:54:27] <acidjazz> minecraft DATA
[20:54:44] <acidjazz> whats this for rom1504
[20:59:04] <TeddyMurray> hi, my jquery dialog box is missing the X inside the button -- anyone have this problem before?
[21:02:54] <rom1504> alright figured it out using jquery animate
[21:03:07] <rom1504> acidjazz: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data
[21:03:30] <rom1504> used for building custom client/server in js,java,python
[21:05:46] <acidjazz> so it just sends data?
[21:05:52] <acidjazz> from a miencraft server?
[21:06:09] <acidjazz> what for?
[21:11:43] <rom1504> what ?
[21:12:05] <rom1504> no I mean, we use minecraft-data project to *build* minecraft client and server in javascript
[21:12:24] <rom1504> for example https://github.com/mhsjlw/craftyjs
[21:12:36] <rom1504> or https://github.com/rom1504/rbot
[21:13:41] <rom1504> so anyway, here is what I was trying to do http://prismarinejs.github.io/minecraft-data/?d=blocks#redstone_torch , works well :)
[21:14:29] <acidjazz> why build em in js?
[21:14:30] <acidjazz> for fun?
[21:15:11] <rom1504> why not ?
[21:15:17] <rom1504> but js is nice
[21:15:29] <rom1504> much less verbose than java for example
[21:16:22] <acidjazz> sure
[21:16:28] <acidjazz> jsut wondering since its originally in java
[21:16:31] <acidjazz> if there was another reason
[21:16:56] <rom1504> well, there are implementation of minecraft server and client in many languages now
[21:17:14] <rom1504> but yeah, possibly node.js might be faster in some cases
[21:17:42] <rom1504> but the main reason is because it's nicer to code in js ^^
[21:18:41] <rom1504> (we're quickly getting off topic though, you might be interested by #mcdevs though)
[21:19:40] <acidjazz> well that and it must be fun coding a minecraft server
[21:19:44] <acidjazz> rather than somethign new :)
[23:18:36] <Utils> If I had something like $("<div><div><span></span></div>...</div>") would jquery use the outer most element?
