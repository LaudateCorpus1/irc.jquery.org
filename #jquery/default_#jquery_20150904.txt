[00:02:09] <idiot> I have some screenshots of recipes that I would like to put on 4x6 cards but still be able to read the words. Is there a way to do this are am I going to have to print them out on full sheets of paper? They are not on a computer they are on a tablet
[00:02:24] <Cork> idiot: do i have to go and ask them to have you kicked too=
[00:02:27] <toomus> idiot: nice nick ;)
[00:02:28] <Cork> *?
[00:02:37] <Cork> toomus: it is a spammer
[00:34:55] <EugenA> If I click on one radio button I put white overlay over a form. But I still can access it with TAB key. What would be best approach to disable access to that form? simply remove tabindex from fields?
[00:44:17] <biostrace> hello
[00:47:36] <claytonzaugg> For anyone that knows meteor, based on this code, https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/5cd34c365fbc6d9aa693 is there any reason why I am not getting the list of Categories populated, even though the browser console shows 6 when I type Categories.find().count()?
[00:48:37] <biostrace> i have a question about Chrome Extension, jquery and localstorageDB , can anyone help ?
[00:58:39] <Cork> biostrace: you're better of taking chrome extension development in a channel for that
[00:59:07] <biostrace> thanks
[00:59:43] <Cork> claytonzaugg: meteor isn't jquery so you should take it in there support channel/forum/what ever
[01:00:31] <claytonzaugg> Cork, thanks for the heads up, I posted it there as well, slow night, was hoping I might anyone with knowledge in here.  I'll keep it in #Meteor from here out.  Thanks
[01:01:23] <Cork> claytonzaugg: the framework is quite new so i wouldn't expect it to be too active
[01:01:45] <Cork> so ya, you most likely will have to accept it takes time to get answers
[01:01:58] <claytonzaugg> For sure.  Here's to hoping answers arrive!  :)
[01:39:24] <Xatenev> Cork: wanna take a look at #css again? :P
[01:40:02] <dapseen> hello, i am new to jquery, is there any script i can use to create the type of slide found on https://www.amazon.com/gp/gw/ajax/s.html

[01:57:02] <bongjovi> I'm trying to use $(document).on('click'... on a div inside a google map, is this outside the scope of document?
[01:58:29] <Cork> bongjovi: maps is normally loaded in an iframe if i remember correctly
[01:58:38] <bongjovi> ah that makes sense
[01:58:48] <Cork> (inspect the dom and see)
[01:58:53] <Cork> haven't used it in a long while
[01:59:00] <Cork> and the api has changed quite a bit since
[02:01:38] <Macaveli> If you run a website in an iframe is it possible to change things on the site you "iframing" via JQ? Like labels for Example
[02:02:47] <Cork> only if they fall into the same security context (same domain normally)
[02:10:43] <penggunaphp> Hello..
[02:14:29] <penggunaphp> any body here?
[02:14:37] <km4> yes
[02:21:24] <instance> hey anyone here familiiar with jquery mobile
[02:22:05] <penggunaphp> ofcourse
[02:23:36] <instance> i'm using it with phonegap and i'm loading external html files via JS for an mvc template
[02:23:41] <instance> $('#content').load(location+".html"
[02:23:54] <instance> thing is i don't know if this works with the back button
[02:24:55] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/jmw7jmmp/5/ <--- what's wrong with line 20 of javascript pane or what else can I do?
[02:40:30] <blinky_> Hi guys, could someone tell me what I am doing wrong here, I am not getting the alert. - http://jsfiddle.net/96ngdwmc/
[02:43:14] <Cork> blinky_: 1. don't use event attributes, 2. don't use alert for debugging, that is what we have console.log for
[02:43:22] <Kartagis> callID is not defined
[02:43:46] <Shadow> Hi, I am trying to get jQuery to set selected in a multiselect but its not working. http://jsfiddle.net/jf9u96ns/4/
[02:44:17] <Cork> blinky_: http://jsfiddle.net/96ngdwmc/1/
[02:45:20] <Cork> Shadow: your css is breaking the page... (blocks the loading...)
[02:47:38] <Shadow> Cork: sorry, try now http://jsfiddle.net/jf9u96ns/5/
[02:48:06] <Cork> Shadow: you can't set select with an array to val
[02:48:13] <Cork> val only works for single select
[02:48:24] <blinky_> cheers cork.
[02:48:24] <Cork> you have to check what the plugin has to manage that
[02:49:25] <Shadow> If I comment out line 1 it selects them
[02:50:24] <Cork> Shadow: cool, that is actually news to me
[02:50:42] * Cork goes to read the code to figure out how that is possible
[02:52:39] <Cork> ah
[02:52:48] <Cork> cool, wonder when that was added
[02:53:23] <Cork> Shadow: anyway, the plugin replaces the select element
[02:53:33] <instance> with jquery mobile, is there a way to have one header that stays that same, and then just load all the other content externally
[02:53:40] <Cork> so it won't behave like it normally would (and this is why you should normally avoid doing this)
[02:53:52] <Shadow> Any idea how I can get it to work with the plugin
[02:54:11] <Cork> you would have to check the documentation of the plugin
[02:54:28] <Cork> i suspect it has either a refresh function or a set function
[02:55:56] <Cork> Shadow: http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/#Methods
[02:56:12] <Shadow> From what I can see this is what they say to use $('select.SlectBox')[0].sumo.selectItem(2);
[02:57:16] <Shadow> but how can I replace 2 with "Ladies Fashions"
[02:57:48] <Cork> again check the plugin documentation
[02:57:53] <Cork> the answer might be "you can't"
[02:59:13] <Shadow> Ok thanks
[03:01:40] <jhave> Hello
[03:01:48] <jhave> I have a problem with this
[03:01:50] <jhave> http://jsfiddle.net/u1vjtg46/
[03:02:05] <jhave> How do i gets its calculate correct ?
[03:02:48] <Cork> jhave: what is the problem with it?
[03:03:17] <Cork> also $(' #priceLeft.h3 ') .h3 is pointless, you already have an id
[03:03:29] <Cork> just use $('#priceLeft')
[03:03:53] <Cork> jhave: also don't add space at the beginning and end of the selector
[03:05:12] <jhave> i look like i have found my first fail :(
[03:05:46] <jhave> but the value need to be posted in #priceRight.h3 as [value]kr
[03:06:23] <Cork> ah, you want the h3 child
[03:06:38] <Cork> jhave: have you read about css seletors?
[03:06:46] <Cork> that is what $() uses
[03:07:06] <Cork> so $('#priceLeft.h3') should be $('#priceLeft h3')
[03:07:43] <jhave> Cork, are you sure ?
[03:08:05] <Cork> jhave: quite
[03:08:21] <Cork> $('#priceLeft.h3') means "find the id priceLeft that has a class "h3"
[03:08:37] <jhave> ohhh :)
[03:08:37] <Cork> and as ids are unique that makes no sense
[03:08:57] <Cork> $('#priceLeft h3') means "find the h3 element that has a parent with the id priceLeft"
[03:09:16] <Cork> (css selectors read from right to left)
[03:10:18] <jhave> Hmm its dont like to work :(
[03:11:38] <jhave> Its need to work when a user change the dropdowns its calculate on new and change the value for H3 to value+kr
[03:12:18] <Cork> well then i recommend adding a separate span for the value
[03:12:45] <Cork> meaning change <h3>0ok</h3> to <h3><span>0</span>kr</h3>
[03:13:04] <Cork> then you just change the selector to '#priceLeft h3 span'
[03:13:11] <jhave> ok, its make sense :)
[03:16:18] <jhave> Cork, do its not calculate correct now ?
[03:20:22] <jhave> I have updated the script
[03:20:23] <jhave> http://jsfiddle.net/u1vjtg46/3/
[03:41:16] <Cork> jhave: well if you're calculating correctly is more then i can say
[03:41:37] <Cork> jhave: ah, another thing
[03:41:50] <Cork> you shouldn't use option:selected in the value selectors
[03:41:59] <Cork> you want the .val of the select element
[03:42:18] <km4> var q = [1,2,3,4]; q[0].remove(); and i got typeerror why ?
[03:42:27] <Cork> jhave: http://jsfiddle.net/u1vjtg46/4/
[03:42:44] <Cork> km4: cause arrays doesn't have a method "remove"
[03:43:05] <Cork> if you want to remove the first element in the list you use .shift()
[03:43:32] <decx> or splice
[03:43:49] <Cork> well splice is if you want to manage elements further in the list
[03:44:11] <Cork> but .shift/.pop is preferable if they do what you want
[03:44:16] <km4> i will remove this elem
[03:44:35] <Cork> that isn't elements
[03:44:39] <Cork> its numbers in an array
[03:45:32] <decx> isnt it called elements
[03:46:20] <Cork> decx: based on earlier questions i suspect he is mixing things up again
[03:46:22] <km4> ok how i must use if i need remove only 3 or 2 numbers ?
[03:46:37] <Cork> km4: make a code example of what you want to do
[03:46:43] <km4> ok
[03:48:31] <jquery> hi
[03:48:45] <jquery> does jquery UI includes jquery core?
[03:48:55] <Cork> no
[03:49:02] <Cork> it depends on it
[03:49:06] <jquery> so I have to include both of them?
[03:49:09] <Cork> yes
[03:49:11] <jquery> ok
[03:49:25] <Cork> javascript libs should never include there dependencies
[03:49:37] <jquery> sorry what?
[03:49:41] <Cork> cause then you get conflict if the page need to use that lib separately
[03:50:10] <Cork> jquery: if a lib, like ex jquery-ui included jquery "core" you would have to use the version of jquery.js it included
[03:50:22] <Cork> if you had something that depended on an older version you would be screwed
[03:50:49] <Cork> so, a lib should never include its dependencies, it should require that you included them, in what ever way "you" as the site administrator want
[03:51:18] <jquery> so that is why jquery ui does not include jquery core...
[03:51:22] <Cork> yes
[03:51:28] <jquery> got it thanks :)
[03:52:27] <jquery> does jquery ui support IE8 ?
[03:52:34] <Cork> 1.x does
[03:52:36] <Cork> 2.x doesn't
[03:52:37] <jquery> ok
[03:53:00] <jquery> whats new in 2.x compared to 1.x ?
[03:53:37] <Cork> some code clean up, some optimization doable cause ie<9 is dropped
[03:53:53] <jquery> ok
[03:53:54] <Cork> and some features not possible in ie<9 (like errors for jsonp calls)
[03:54:03] <jquery> ok
[03:54:20] <Cork> but they are meant to be feature compatible
[03:54:37] <Cork> 1.9+ and 2.0+ is meant to have the same features
[03:55:02] <Cork> meaning 1.9 and 2.0, 1.10 and 2.1 and so on
[03:55:18] <km4> guys http://jsfiddle.net/fcmmw5c9/1/
[03:55:29] <Cork> 3.0 is meant to be a large rewrite from what i've seen
[03:55:30] <jquery> Cork:  thanks, good day bye
[03:55:34] <km4> i will remove popup in categories
[03:56:29] <Cork> km4: http://jsfiddle.net/fcmmw5c9/2/
[03:57:23] <km4> not working for me ;P
[03:57:47] <Cork> not sure if highshart will trigger an update from modifying the array
[03:57:53] <Cork> most likely doesn't
[03:59:10] <decx> high shart tehehehe
[03:59:50] <km4> ;/
[04:11:34] <decx> use setData btw
[05:22:48] <rubinhozzz> I'm using JQM. I have a flipswitch, but whenever I try to use it by code, I get an error: Error: cannot call methods on flipswitch prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh' ....... Then, I checked through the web and I was using document.ready instead of document.pageinit, so I changed this, but still I get the error! What can it be happening?
[05:31:16] <alturic> If I knew I was going to eventually (as in they generate in real-time on the server) always have say... 50 files in a given directory, and each file is a <button> on a page... is there any way to have angular or jquery "know" if the 50 files exist? So if files 1-10 exist, the <button> has a different class to it versus a non-existent file? I'm trying to wrap my head around if this is something
[05:31:16] <alturic> strictly server-side or if it could be done client-side... I'm thinking even if it was client-side capable, it would have to try hitting all 50 files in order to know if they existed... blah.
[05:34:35] <A___> hi good people!
[05:35:17] <A___> does anybody tested jquery mobile on iOS 9 Beta?
[05:55:19] <km4> http://jsfiddle.net/wgu97Lt8/ why they box trembles/shakes ? if i mousover ? not normal smooth,easing transform ?
[05:56:10] <Xatenev> km4: dont understand?
[05:56:48] <Cork> km4: you use mouseover/out
[05:56:55] <Xatenev> aah, you move the box to the right
[05:56:59] <Cork> so when the element move out from the cursor it triggers to go back
[05:57:01] <Xatenev> and then ur not "mouse over" anymore
[05:57:36] <Cork> km4: the simplest solution is to add a parent that has a constant position (and has the needed size of it all)
[05:57:43] <Cork> and bind the event there instead
[05:57:46] <km4> its move fine when i dont move my mous on the link
[05:58:15] <Cork> ya, cause the mouse event isn't triggered unless you move the mouse
[05:58:16] <Xatenev> km4: because the mouesover event checks only if your mouse moves or not
[05:59:16] <Cork> (also you can do that animation without needing js)
[05:59:23] <Cork> just use :hover
[06:03:40] <km4> http://pages.revox.io/latest/form_elements.html look, this sidebar, working very nice not like my ;/
[06:03:49] <km4> they too have mouseout i guess
[06:05:13] <Cork> km4: except it doesn't move away from the cursor like your does
[06:07:08] <Saturn812> hi! Looking for help. I have a group of 3 inputs. Each input has it's own type. Thier name are the following "input[$][{input_type}]. I want to change $ to a counter, so inputs with a same group would have one number. How would i go about doing it?
[06:07:47] <Cork> Saturn812: not sure what you mean
[06:07:59] <Cork> are you looking for a way to replace the $ in the string?
[06:08:11] <Saturn812> yes, but i need to replace it in a group of 3
[06:08:18] <Cork> .replace('$', counter++); would do that
[06:08:40] <Cork> or ya groupId or how ever you want to store the replacement value
[06:09:06] <Cork> >> print("input[$][{input_type}]".replace('$', 3))
[06:09:22] <Cork> ah, the bot is down again
[06:09:32] <Saturn812> that would replace $ with 3?
[06:09:52] <Cork> Saturn812: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[06:10:13] <Cork> sounds like you need to read up on standard js functions
[06:10:21] <Saturn812> that's not what i meant
[06:10:57] <Saturn812> i need 3 inputs have a similar value replaced. Then increase value of counter and replace next three input with one number
[06:11:16] <Cork> Saturn812: ya, so you have to loop the elements, modify the value you get from name
[06:11:23] <Cork> and replace the name with the new string you want
[06:11:47] <Cork> there is no built in "find element and modify the string in attribute x" if that is what you're looking for
[06:12:05] <surianup> I hvae an issue on my x-axis tickes D3 graph
[06:12:07] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/emporio/xpvsjz1s/19/
[06:12:30] <Saturn812> for loop is just looks agly :(
[06:12:30] <surianup> I have data from 2006 but x-axis ticks are displaying from 2007 but I need to display from 2006
[06:12:43] <Cork> Saturn812: well so use $().each
[06:12:52] <Cork> you still have to loop it
[06:13:14] <Cork> well there is an option to give a function to .attr and do the loop that way
[06:13:18] <Cork> but it is still a loop
[06:14:02] <surianup> can anyone help me on D3 line chart
[06:14:16] <Saturn812> yeah, that's what i am planning to do. Make a ('#id').attr and change the name with counter. For each input separately. Thank you, Cork
[06:16:16] <Cork> Saturn812: http://jsfiddle.net/r7hL1umy/
[06:16:30] <surianup> hello cork
[06:16:49] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/emporio/xpvsjz1s/19/ I need your help please
[06:25:58] <Saturn812> Cork, looks like i have to wrap in it .each to iterate throu all of them
[06:26:13] <Cork> Saturn812: check the fiddle i gave you
[06:26:22] <Cork> yes you have to loop it, but attr can do that
[06:26:30] <Saturn812> but it doesn't?
[06:26:34] <Cork> it does
[06:26:36] <Saturn812> it only changes the first element
[06:26:39] <Cork> check the effect on the fiddle
[06:27:26] <Saturn812> ah, probably my mistake, i use id for selector
[06:27:39] <Cork> id can only ever match one element
[06:27:52] <Cork> as it by definition is an id of the element so == unique
[06:28:23] <Saturn812> that complicate things...
[06:28:31] <Cork> not really
[06:28:41] <Cork> use a class if you want multiple elements
[06:31:32] <Shadow> Hi, I have a string that is like this: Test No1, Test No2, Test No3     How can I get it to look like this: "Test No1", "Test No2", "Test No3"
[06:32:02] <Cork> Shadow: could you wrap the first one in "" so it is easier to see what it exactly looks like?
[06:33:28] <Shadow> The looks like "Test No1, Test No2, Test No3" without double quotes
[06:34:00] <Cork> well if it is a string it needs them to reprecent that they are a string (or single quotes)
[06:34:10] <Cork> "Test No1, Test No2, Test No3".split(', ') would do
[06:35:46] <Shadow> thank you
[07:23:25] <blinky_> Could someone have a look at this code for me please.  I beleive it may be a little difficult to understand what is going on but I will try to explain.  I have an input to which the user starts to input a name, as the user inputs the ajax is checking the database and providing a list.  The list is populated fine, when the user selects a name from the list the script will call the php script, populate a session and reload that form, this is fine.  The
[07:23:25] <blinky_> issue I am having is if I start to type one name, then backspace and start with a new name it only shows the rows returned from the first name? - http://jsfiddle.net/96ngdwmc/3/

[07:53:12] <morphyeys> have a nice evening and a great weekend guys see you!
[08:02:50] <silverdust> I am inside a .getJSON() making another .getJSON() request and I have a value from the nested requested to use within the outter scope so I had set a var foo; and inside the nested requested a foo = data; console.log(foo) inside the nested request callback works but it fails in the outter callback
[08:03:35] <silverdust> How is the best way to have my data available to the outter callback as I've already defined it there?
[08:05:00] <NoiseEee> silverdust: peek at https://api.jquery.com/jquery.deferred/ and http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:05:21] <NoiseEee> actually you can still use it with .getJSON
[08:05:36] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/ and look for "The jqXHR Object"
[08:08:12] <silverdust> NoiseEee: honestly I'm lost. I don't see the deferred doing the work of passing the variable to the scope where I need it
[08:08:34] <silverdust> or maybe it's not just so easy to comprehend on a first read
[08:08:52] <silverdust> And there's no examples
[08:09:48] <zumba_ad_> so a backbonejs dev told me that backbone fetch() calls sync() which calls $.ajax. He also told me that $.ajax returns $.Deferred object. Is this true?
[08:10:01] <NoiseEee> silverdust: i think the idea is that you shouldn't do an xhr request within an xhr request
[08:10:15] <NoiseEee> silverdust: so start there; make the second one after the first completes successfully
[08:11:35] <NoiseEee> zumba_ad_: yes
[08:11:43] <zumba_ad_> cool :)
[08:11:49] <zumba_ad_> thanks a lot for the confirmation
[08:12:29] <zumba_ad_> The culprit is how we prototype backbonejs' fetch which is now using deferred. However, there is no need because backbonejs sync uses $.ajax which returns deferred "D
[08:12:31] <zumba_ad_> :D
[08:12:59] <zumba_ad_> and the good thing that happened is that I am now able to capture errors using .fail
[08:13:02] <silverdust> ok I think I understand better. Will try that thanks
[08:13:17] <Luun> hey all, I’ve also got a deferred question. If I get a promise by doing $.when and attached some deferred objects, is there any good way for me to attached extra conditions onto this promise after the fact?
[08:13:35] <Luun> it looks like the promise doesn’t have a “when” method for me to attach more deferred objects
[08:14:18] <silverdust> NoiseEee: pm? Just for a short question
[08:15:32] <shoky> Luun: what do you mean by attaching extra conditions after the fact?  and by attaching deferred objects?
[08:16:13] <NoiseEee> sorry no time silverdust, but asking in channel will get more eyes on to help everyone
[08:16:19] <NoiseEee> also http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/making-promises-with-jquery-deferred.html is a nice resource bbiab
[08:20:59] <silverdust> I get .getJSON(...).done is not  function
[08:22:11] <shoky> silverdust show your code
[08:24:23] <silverdust> here http://pastie.org/10397130
[08:26:44] <shoky> silverdust you can't access stuff from the inner getjson callback outside of it, only inside. why not put it inside?
[08:28:05] <silverdust> NoiseEee just said to put it in the .done()
[08:28:47] <shoky> and?
[08:28:56] <silverdust> but I just thought rather than trying to make the category variable available from the nested request I can just make all the DOM insertions right in there
[08:29:27] <shoky> you can, put the DOM insertion in the inner getjson callback, that should work
[08:29:48] <silverdust> but I'll really like to know for future reference. If I was to pass category outside, how will that be
[08:30:03] <silverdust> Like to make it available in the scope of the outter callback
[08:30:09] <shoky> you don't
[08:30:28] <shoky> it's only available after the getjson request is completed
[08:30:36] <shoky> by that time, the outer function is already long finished
[08:32:09] <KingL4> hello all im getting an additional undefined div with this code http://laravel.io/bin/529zJ I think it has to do with the for loop. I don't know enough on what i can do here though
[08:33:13] <silverdust> ok thanks shoky , NoiseEee
[08:41:15] <KingL4> can anyone explain why this is giving me an extra blank div element? i think its in the for loop but i don't know http://laravel.io/bin/529zJ
[08:41:52] <robertmaxrees> is files an array?
[08:42:23] <robertmaxrees> (some more info would be nice)
[08:43:23] <KingL4> its the object from uploader. I am using plupload and FilesAdded is an option you can add http://www.plupload.com/docs/Uploader#FilesAdded-event
[08:43:39] <robertmaxrees> share an example of the data, then.
[08:43:44] <robertmaxrees> stringify it and make a fiddle.
[08:43:52] <KingL4> so files is all the files i am uploading.
[08:44:07] <robertmaxrees> for in can cause some headaches which is why i asked.
[08:47:14] <KingL4> umm so conceptually files is the object of all the files that are uploaded var i im assuming is the iteration through the object, right? is that why you use Var I in...? Because you are iterating through an object? is there another way to iterate through an object. Like for reg for loops you can loop through an array, for example, upto the (LENGTH-
[08:47:15] <KingL4> 1) of that array since arrays start at index 0. Does all that make sense because I just want to know if there are other ways to do what  this for loop is doing
[08:48:02] <robertmaxrees> for loops on arrays are kind of a bad idea too, but for in on objects can accidentally try to hit the prototype chain.
[08:48:49] <robertmaxrees> which is why you either avoid them or make sure you do them correctly.  need to use hasOwnProperty or use a forEach against the array made by Object.keys()
[08:51:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0qdhLmhq/ these are the two "smart" ways to enumerate over objects.
[08:53:59] <KingL4> I got it to work! removed the for and just used plupload.each so now it looks like this: http://laravel.io/bin/kWroX I still don't understand too much about js objects but getting there
[08:54:20] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to help you understand heh
[08:54:22] <robertmaxrees> but cool.
[08:58:51] <KingL4> robertmaxrees yea lines 15-17 looks like .each right? the var in your above example (lines 9-11) you're checking if the object has a propname but isn't propname a number, like an iteration.
[08:59:06] <robertmaxrees> you said it's an object, not an array.
[08:59:14] <robertmaxrees> arrays have numeric keys, objects typically don't.
[08:59:24] <KingL4> if propname is the attributes within the object wouldn't line 10 always be true?
[08:59:37] <robertmaxrees> and for in loops can go up the prototype chain.
[08:59:42] <robertmaxrees> which is generally not what you want.
[09:00:39] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/jmw7jmmp/10/ <--- why is this not showing me any results back? please select 'child character' from 'kategorisi' dropdown and hit the button
[09:01:32] <Kartagis> not appending anything rather
[09:02:53] <KingL4> robertmaxrees so hypothetically if i had an object with mutiple functions and functions within functions are you saying the For in will loop through everything even those nested? i know I have to still study some so this will be my last question lol
[09:07:10] <NoiseEee> KingL4: no
[09:07:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:07:28] <robertmaxrees> it's the inheritance model of javascript.
[09:59:59] <Inspiral> is there a way I can pause javascript and execute each function one by one until I find the function that is running for a given element?
[10:00:09] <robertmaxrees> debug
[10:00:26] <Inspiral> so the step over functions in the debugger should work for this?
[10:00:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:00:34] <Inspiral> i see the pause and thats ok
[10:00:39] <Inspiral> right it didnt seem to work
[10:00:40] <Inspiral> ill try again
[10:00:41] <robertmaxrees> well, theoretically.
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[10:01:19] <Inspiral> some javascript is removing elements from a select box and im trying to figure out what is doing that
[10:01:43] <robertmaxrees> how many scripts on the page?
[10:02:01] <Inspiral> a fair few, its a wordpress site with a load of plugins
[10:03:36] <robertmaxrees> i might start disabling plugins to start with.
[10:03:47] <robertmaxrees> you can also set dom breakpoints in some browser, but that might not be helpful here.
[10:03:54] <Inspiral> yeh, i was looking for a quicker way than that
[10:36:16] <Kartagis> is it possible to slide page like jquery mobile does, without jq mobile
[10:36:18] <Kartagis> ?
[10:36:40] <robertmaxrees> it's just javascript soooo...
[10:36:49] <Kartagis> uhm
[10:37:04] <Kartagis> what do I need to read?
[10:37:16] <robertmaxrees> could always read through the jqm source.
[10:39:15] <based_pdev> if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe
[10:39:23] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:39:33] <robertmaxrees> you could abstract out the relevant bits.
[11:51:34] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[12:00:53] <gordon1> hello
[12:01:08] <gordon1> need a little help running the jquery source tests
[12:01:43] <gordon1> i tried running them in Firefox, file:///...jquery/test/index.html
[12:02:00] <gordon1> but the AJAX tests don't run -- they need a PHP environment
[12:02:15] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:02:16] <gordon1> how do I run these properly?  (I'm on Ubuntu)
[12:02:22] <gordon1> sorry for the n00b question
[12:02:39] <robertmaxrees> there's a full setup - https://github.com/jquery/jquery#running-the-unit-tests
[12:19:08] <gordon1> @robertmaxrees -- thank you
[12:19:22] <gordon1> this worked for the master branch of the source
[12:19:58] <gordon1> it doesn't work for branch 2.1-stable -- fails "Task 'jshint:all' failed"
[12:20:29] <gordon1> but I think the master branch will do for what I have in mind
[12:20:31] <gordon1> thanks again
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> what're you trying to do?
[12:21:11] <gordon1> really, look at the unit tests to see how Deferred works
[12:21:14] <gordon1> and promises
[12:21:24] <robertmaxrees> like, how to use them?
[12:21:28] <robertmaxrees> because that's easy
[12:21:33] <gordon1> yes, and how to test them
[12:21:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, simple to use.
[12:21:47] <robertmaxrees> and test.
[12:23:09] <gordon1> Well, I think I get them, but not sure on the testing of them.  Hoping the jquery source tests will help
[13:21:16] <NitroLiq> Anyone know of a tut or something that goes over simple menu logic (i.e., click one icon a div slides in, click another, previous div slides out and a new div appears, etc.)?
[13:21:46] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easily done yourself.
[13:23:23] <NitroLiq> Ive been hitting stack exchange but not really finding what I'm looking for.
[13:23:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because it's pretty basic stuff.
[13:23:50] <robertmaxrees> like, just this side of "hide/show elements on click"
[13:25:09] <NitroLiq> That's what's driving me nuts. You'd think the info would be readily out there
[13:25:33] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> what part are you getting hung up on?
[13:26:52] <NitroLiq> I think I'm just getting confused with what I have going on in the CSS and what I need to happen in jQuery.
[13:27:07] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got and we can try to help :)
[13:27:18] <NitroLiq> I get the gist that I have to check whether something hasClass active
[13:27:30] <robertmaxrees> actually, you don't need to do that :)
[13:27:43] <NitroLiq> trying not to overthink things
[13:28:30] <NitroLiq> I can show you what I have on my node server but aside from adding/removing an active class for a selected item, I've removed the rest of the code
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> do it inh a jsfiddle.
[13:29:05] <NitroLiq> give me a few
[13:29:16] <logany> is there any way I can remove the last script element from my doc's <head> ?
[13:29:31] <robertmaxrees> logany removing it via js would do you much good.
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> *don't
[13:29:56] <logany> wouldn't* :P
[13:29:57] <robertmaxrees> err, **won't do you much good - i cannot type today >.>
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:30:18] <logany> howcome? It's putting in css there thats messing up my design :/
[13:30:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to remove the CSS.
[13:30:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't guarantee that you're going to remove it in time is what i mean.
[13:31:15] <logany> robertmaxrees: might I show you my page so you can see what I'm trying to remove?
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> post it to the channel i guess.
[13:31:29] <logany> don't care how it gets removed though just that it does
[13:31:35] <robertmaxrees> do it through your backend then.
[13:31:50] <logany> http://www.smartpeeps.co.za
[13:31:53] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq i don't normally do this but http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/89mdwLyd/
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> really basic concept.
[13:32:03] <robertmaxrees> logany so what's the issue?
[13:32:14] <logany> robertmaxrees: check where the menu is?
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> what menu.
[13:32:24] <logany> across the top
[13:32:29] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> (fully describe the problem)
[13:32:56] <logany> it's out of position on account of the <style> element in the page header that's being rendered with CDATA in it
[13:33:27] <robertmaxrees> "out of position"?
[13:33:38] <logany> it should be against the very top of the page
[13:33:48] <logany> ie: margin-top: -14px;
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> looks right to me.
[13:34:22] <logany> might I ask you to screenshot it?
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> do you mean the element below it is being pushed down a few px?
[13:34:52] <logany> nope... the menu items themselves are being pushed down. Everything else is fine
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/26SHTTl.png
[13:35:33] <logany> wtf with that now?
[13:35:36] <robertmaxrees> that's from the very bottom of my toolbar to the bottom of the viewport
[13:35:40] <logany> seems like I've got a cached copy
[13:35:54] <robertmaxrees> chrome looks broken though.
[13:36:42] <logany> which browser are you using there?
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> firefox.
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> #SmartpeepMainMenu_SkipLink > img - killing that fixes things.
[13:38:20] <robertmaxrees> just display: none; that and you should be good to go.
[13:39:33] <logany> I'm sooooo confused now coz I refreshed after clearing my cache and it's working fine now
[13:39:40] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> chrome looked busted to me/.
[13:41:02] <gambl0re> sup shorty?...
[13:41:41] <logany> so weird robertmaxrees ... looks fine now so like, everything I know about web design has just been invalidated or something lol
[13:46:45] <NitroLiq> Robert: Thx for the fiddle. Essentially this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqeJKb is where I'm at now.
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> follow the example i gave you.
[13:47:08] <NitroLiq> The way I was thinking about the logic was using one of the icon classes
[13:47:23] <NitroLiq> and doing an if/esle
[13:47:31] <NitroLiq> else
[13:47:34] <robertmaxrees> why do you need a conditional?
[13:48:26] <NitroLiq> If such and such icon is selected, animate this div, else...something else.
[13:48:41] <robertmaxrees> right, don't do it that way.
[13:48:44] <NitroLiq> I knew it was wrong so I scratched it. That's where I was having the hang up
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> look at the way i did it with the fiddle.
[13:49:05] <robertmaxrees> follow that pattern instead.
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> your method couples things together way too much.
[13:52:18] <NitroLiq> That's what I was trying to fix
[13:57:25] <paulong_> Hi i have this problem http://imgur.com/jZ5V6ZM I can't open none of my hmtl on the brwoner
[13:57:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[13:57:51] <paulong_> i've using jquery mobile
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> trying to use ajax it looks like.
[13:58:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[14:01:22] <paulong_> look the last part http://imgur.com/c8JsI26
[14:01:35] <CapnKlutch> Hi can I please get some help
[14:01:46] <CapnKlutch> Why is this not converting the second match? - http://jsfiddle.net/dqnmj6ta/
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch just ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will.
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> paulong_ you need to run that on a server it looks like.
[14:02:00] <robertmaxrees> not off your hard drive.
[14:02:26] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch do what now?
[14:02:28] <CapnKlutch> it is converting the 1H but not the 2H in the same input feild
[14:02:39] <CapnKlutch> Look at 2nd column
[14:02:53] <CapnKlutch> Is should convert 2H to 2♥
[14:02:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a global regex.
[14:03:04] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, how?
[14:03:14] <CapnKlutch> Don't know what that is
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dqnmj6ta/1/
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[14:03:43] <paulong_> but I've been use my brwonse , where i can see my html
[14:03:48] <paulong_> i dont get it
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> paulong_ welcome to web development.  setup a local server and see how that goes.
[14:04:14] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, thank you so much
[14:05:00] <paulong_> hahaha ty, but I'm not sure how can I do that xD
[14:06:00] <logany> paulong_: if you're using a windows OS, try xampp or wamp server
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> or just nginx or apache.
[14:06:08] <logany> that'll take care of most of it for you
[14:06:19] <robertmaxrees> really simply stuff :)
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> *simple
[14:06:43] <paulong_> i have wamp server let me find out how xD
[15:38:45] <ThePendulum> I am having trouble reinitializing DataTables after it has been initialized without data. If it's first initialized with data, it reinitializes fine. Does anyone know how to initialize DataTables 'empty' safely?
[16:13:41] <asidjazz> paulong_: nginx
[16:13:54] <asidjazz> paulong_: brwonse ?
[16:14:39] <asidjazz> paulong_: lil miguel campello there?
[16:14:56] <asidjazz> so italian of you
[16:16:27] <roger1> Hi, I have a css class that is used twice and I want to append a div to both of them.  This doesn't seem to work though.. Any ideas?   var test_div = document.createElement('div');          $('.test-class')[0].appendChild(test_div);  $('.test-class')[1].appendChild(test_div);
[17:39:38] <deweydb> how would i go about finding the first parent dom node that has a certain class?
[17:53:26] <shoky> deweydb: .closest('.class')
[19:43:52] <Cheaterman> js is not funny
[19:43:58] <Cheaterman> but jquery makes it much better \o/
