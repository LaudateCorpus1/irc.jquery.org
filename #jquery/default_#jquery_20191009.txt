[07:16:19] <heyheyehe> hey gyus, how u doing?
[07:17:03] <heyheyehe> :thinkingFace:
[07:22:13] <thykka> gyus??
[07:39:11] <Cork> isn't that kinda obviously a typo?
[07:40:13] <thykka> porablyb
[15:18:34] * taplar plays lonely violin
[15:18:38] <robertmaxrees> haha
[15:19:08] <taplar> too redundant?
[15:19:32] <robertmaxrees> nah.  lonely fiddle would be though.
[15:19:53] <taplar> wait, which one is the small one at your chin?
[15:20:09] <robertmaxrees> hahaha fiddle and violin are the same thing.
[15:20:14] <taplar> -_-
[15:20:15] <robertmaxrees> exact same instrument.
[15:20:31] <taplar> i'm not a smart man robert.  you can't do that to me....
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> difference is, nobody cares when you spill a beer on a fiddle.
[15:21:32] <taplar> lol, are you in concert, ...... or front porch?
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[15:22:22] <robertmaxrees> is the average person wearing shoes or nah?
[15:23:02] <taplar> are you familiar with one bellzbub?
[15:23:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:23:33] <taplar> within the great state of georgia?
[15:23:43] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:23:48] <taplar> ah, you must have a violin then
[15:23:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:24:18] <robertmaxrees> you hear about the power shutoffs out here?
[15:24:27] <taplar> no?
[15:24:54] * taplar just found an ap article
[15:25:05] <robertmaxrees> Couple electric companies are shutting off power up and down the state because of weather conditions.
[15:26:34] <taplar> Is your home in that area?
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> it is.  and work.  but they only shut down part of my town.
[15:27:57] <taplar> I'm assuming your workplace has backup generators?
[15:28:15] <robertmaxrees> yep, but legislation says we can't run them for very long.
[15:28:20] <taplar> -_-
[15:28:30] <robertmaxrees> and they only provide power to some systems.  HVAC is not one of them.
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> luckily most of us can work remotely.
[15:30:05] <taplar> has there been any public discussion about updating their infrastructure so the wind is less of an issue?
[15:30:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:30:30] <robertmaxrees> not much you can do, really.  50mph+ gusts aren't really something you can protect against.
[15:30:44] <taplar> could go underground with the lines potentially
[15:31:06] <robertmaxrees> eh, that doesn't necessarily solve everything though.
[15:31:21] <robertmaxrees> you're still going to have overhead lines within towns, and trees falling is a real thing.
[15:31:32] <taplar> yeah
[15:31:38] <robertmaxrees> also it's the low humidity that's a concern, as well.
[15:31:43] <robertmaxrees> not just the wind.
[15:32:12] <robertmaxrees> so an underground transformer can blow, throw sparks, and boom.
[15:32:38] <taplar> has there been much talk around you of people going, "welp, time to start looking into solar for my house"
[15:33:54] <robertmaxrees> CA already requires solar panels on all new houses.  but the grid has to be there - solar isn't viable for everybody.
[15:34:08] <taplar> wow, didn't know that
[15:34:25] <taplar> *the requirment part
[15:35:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.  though they relaxed that for campfire victims since otherwise that would've held up rebuilding efforts.
[16:12:20] <taplar> from awkwardCough: "if its classy its a violin... if its folksy then is a fiddle"
[16:12:29] <taplar> i guess he would know, he does enjoy green tea
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[16:35:41] <taplar> yeah, with pinkie finger UP!
