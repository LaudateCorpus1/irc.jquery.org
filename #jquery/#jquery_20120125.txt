[00:03:05] <progrock`> ok sleep time
[00:12:11] <hendry> Can I add a button with a click event? WWhen I click the button, it doesn't console.log http://jsfiddle.net/sSa5X/3/ :/
[00:14:09] <ablomen> hendry, you need $("<button>Just a test</button>").insertAfter(this).click(...
[00:14:20] <ablomen> you are now binding the click event on the pre element
[00:15:48] <hendry> ablomen: could you please edit the http://jsfiddle.net/sSa5X/3/  since test</button>").insertAfter(this).click(... is not working
[00:16:27] <ablomen> hendry, well update the code in there with what you tried, i'm not going to write the code for you, just help you help yourself ;)
[00:16:32] <mindis|wurk> i'm surprised <button> works
[00:17:01] <hendry> ablomen: sorry, it does work
[00:17:23] <ablomen> mindis|wurk, why? it's  still in the html5 spec
[00:18:00] <mindis|wurk> ablomen precisely. HTML5 is an unpredictable bomb :)
[00:18:11] <ablomen> hehe yeah i agree
[00:21:36] <zoot> hi
[00:21:45] <zoot> is the download function broken?
[00:22:01] <zoot> i only get corrupted .zip-files
[00:22:08] <zoot> using http://jqueryui.com/download
[00:23:33] <zoot> the http header says the file should be around 300kb

[00:24:55] <kevindougans> try a different browser
[00:24:58] <kevindougans> or empty your cache
[00:25:15] <Nocatfarts> reboot your computer ;)
[00:25:22] <kevindougans> i've had a similar problem on another site before and emptying the cache resolved it
[00:25:40] <donCams> hello... is there a function i can use to select an element with a certain rel attr
[00:26:03] <donCams> <a rel="1"></a>, so I would need to select a tag with rel == 1
[00:27:16] <siovene> donCams: shooting randomly, but have you tried 'a[rel="1"]'?
[00:28:30] <donCams> siovene, actually thought about that after I asked the question. lol
[00:29:46] <disappearedng> does jquery's each have a bind context you can pass in?
[00:39:27] <jobbmon> any idea why jplayer might cause my page to display loading symbol forever until i hit play on all videos?
[00:39:47] <jobbmon> it also seem to postpone my print stylesheeet from loading

[01:36:06] <WesleyL> hi, got a question, I'm triggering a click event on some checkboxes, how do I make sure the default event is executed before any handler I attached to the event I'm triggering?
[01:37:19] <the_voice-> Hi
[01:37:47] <the_voice-> can someone help me fix this error: 44TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#myform).ajaxForm')
[01:38:19] <the_voice-> the form id="myform"
[01:38:38] <siovene> the_voice-: do you have mismatching quotation marks there?
[01:39:56] <the_voice-> you mean in the form declaration do I use double quotes and in the query statement do I use single quotes?
[01:41:29] <ravenzz> the_voice- maybe you miss an '
[01:41:32] <ravenzz> $('#myform) <-
[01:41:34] <ravenzz> $('#myform') <-
[01:41:41] <the_voice-> nope
[01:42:08] <the_voice-> my browser would have picked up on it
[01:42:08] <the_voice-> no mismatches
[01:42:08] <the_voice-> * not my browser I mean netbeans
[01:42:19] <siovene> That's the way you pasted it, though.
[01:42:31] <ravenzz> anyway it should be ajaxForm();
[01:42:38] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[01:43:07] <the_voice-> I'll post it in pastebin
[01:45:35] <ravenzz> the_voice- it would be better if you reproduce it on jsfiddle
[01:46:28] <the_voice-> http://pastebin.com/1GyJ9HQQ
[01:46:31] <the_voice-> thats the pastebin
[01:46:34] <the_voice-> jsfiddle?
[01:48:13] <siovene> the_voice-: needless to say you have included the ajaxForm plugin code, right?
[01:48:16] <ravenzz> well this make sense, I am not sure that ajaxForm({ is allowed. ajaxForm(function(){ is correct
[01:49:55] <siovene> ravenzz: you sure? From memory, you do pass a dictionary to ajaxForm.
[01:50:44] <ravenzz> I am not sure
[01:51:30] <the_voice-> it worked in another scenario..
[01:51:31] <siovene> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#ajaxForm
[01:51:52] <siovene> the_voice-: your code looks fine from here. Are you including the ajaxForm plugin js?
[01:52:32] <ravenzz> the_voice- try this http://pastebin.com/jzA6Q0J3
[01:55:09] <the_voice-> siovene good call, dammit I was including javascript/forms.js but not javascript/jQuery/jquery.form.js
[01:55:12] <the_voice-> thanks
[01:55:15] <ravenzz> ..
[01:55:26] <the_voice-> stupid stupid stupid mistake :(
[01:56:25] <siovene> :)
[01:57:04] <the_voice-> we have all done it… it's one of those mistakes I would have spent 12 hours looking for.. I hate those mistakes..
[01:57:09] <the_voice-> They are always the hardest to find
[01:58:48] <ravenzz> the_voice- these are the 1st ones you check
[02:00:20] <the_voice-> I did check it first, but I saw the javascript/forms.js :)

[02:04:59] <Flizzer> Hi ! I use focusout event on an input but it only works in Firefox, not in IE 6 / 8 , is there a trick?
[02:06:03] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Flizzer
[02:06:04] <bot-t> Flizzer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:08:41] <kul> Need 1 small help
[02:10:03] <siovene> kul: help is not something that can be quantified like that. Rather, you need *some* help.
[02:10:31] <kul> yea true
[02:10:44] <siovene> kul: also, see topic. Just ask.
[02:11:02] <kul> I have made 1 slide show
[02:11:08] <kul> and I would like to loop it
[02:11:36] <kul> so when a user clicks on next button and last element is loaded next element must start from 1st
[02:15:54] <DEADB33F> Is there a painless way to add an event listener to an element which gets called whenever any children are added?
[02:16:28] <DEADB33F> Its for a userscript, so I don't have access to the code which adds the children.
[02:22:23] <ravenzz> ?newContent @ DEADB33F
[02:22:23] <bot-t> DEADB33F, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:23:08] <DEADB33F> I'll check it out, thanks.
[02:23:11] <ravenzz> yw
[02:27:46] <DEADB33F> hmm, I don't think that's going to work as it requires calling a function when the new elements are added... which then adds the callbacks to the new content.
[02:28:09] <DEADB33F> I think, unless I'm reading it wrong.
[02:31:45] <bonhoffer> what is the preferred day to put data in a div, is there something like <div id="foo" data="1,2,3">
[02:32:17] <bonhoffer> i know jquery tries to keep content separate from data, but i just need to do it . . .  :)
[02:35:50] <bonhoffer> so if i have data_location_id="123" in my div, get_attr is the way to pull it?
[02:49:33] <Renkineko> hi :)
[02:52:30] <bonhoffer> how can i load a variable inside $('foo').datepicker( var a = 1}
[02:53:31] <bonhoffer> beforeShow ?
[02:55:27] <Renkineko> I have a little problem with datepicker, and google is not really a good bro right now... I'm developing an application in php/xjax, and sometimes I need to regenerate all the page in a xjax request... But when I'm doing it, the ui-datepicker-div node disappear, and I can't restore it... So, is there a solution to destroy (the method destroy doesn't fit my case...) totaly and reinit the datepicker ?
[02:56:00] <Renkineko> bonhoffer : what do you want to do exactly ?
[02:56:28] <bonhoffer> Renkineko: i'm using datepicker like an event calendar
[02:56:54] <bonhoffer> i want to access the id of the div that datepicker is attached to to pull events
[02:57:26] <bonhoffer> <div class="dp" id="123> and i want to do an ajax call off the url events/123
[02:58:00] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. With jQuery's animation() effect, if I have a whole bunch of animations one after the other, does the next animation wait until the current animation is executed? When I test this it seems to be the case, but I'm just wondering if I should rather implement a callback to guarantee the serial execution. Thanks
[03:00:20] <bonhoffer> Renkineko: does that make sense?
[03:01:08] <Renkineko> I don't understand where's your problem... You want to do an ajax call when you choose a date ?
[03:01:49] <Renkineko> (I want to precise, I'm not an expert, just trying to help in the waiting to be helped :p)
[03:04:31] <bonhoffer> Renkineko: i want an ajax call onload that gets a bunch of events from a database based on the id of the div the datepicker is attached to
[03:09:00] <Renkineko> ok got it, i'm searching
[03:12:22] <bonhoffer> Renkineko: i see a way: http://jsfiddle.net/Tobbe/JrkSN/3/

[03:48:40] <stevefrost> How can I check if a change event was fired by a keypress event?
[03:51:27] <_ikke_> stevefrost: A keypress event does not fire a change event
[03:51:48] <stevefrost> it does when the keypress is enter :)
[03:52:03] <_ikke_> stevefrost: n/m
[03:53:11] <_ikke_> stevefrost: try event.which
[03:53:46] <stevefrost> event.which is not set when you grab the change event
[04:07:12] <_ikke_> afaik, it's not possible then
[04:07:20] <_ikke_> but I could be missing something
[04:26:35] <fRAiLtY-> Using a jQuery datepicker, how can I turn the date around so when selected it appears as dd/mm/yyyy not mm/dd/yyyy http://www.blackwellprint.co.uk/ws2/ (click on delivery date to see).
[04:38:00] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/g2bxh9sbrp9f5pb0qhvayw - I have this, which works, however, I have 10 #splint_storlek - do I make a for loop for that or?
[04:40:58] <CasW> Hey guys, I want to load an image and have a callback when it's loaded; $("img").load() doesn't seem to do the trick? (Of course, "img" is replaced by the specific id of the img in my code)
[04:41:51] <larsemil> u use $("#img") i presume?
[04:41:54] <larsemil> with the hash
[04:42:30] <CasW> Well, yes, if I regard the specific id, yes ;) ("img" regards all images in the HTML, IIRC)
[04:42:46] <CasW> But the problem is, that the callback is called, but the image doesn't seem to be loaded
[04:45:04] <larsemil> CasW: i used $(window).load(function() {} ); but that of course loads all im ages.
[04:45:09] <larsemil> images
[04:45:45] <CasW> $(window).load("someSource", function() {}); I suppose?
[04:46:14] <larsemil> nope, like i wrote. that does the trick for me.
[04:46:45] <CasW> Isn't doing the trick for me...
[04:47:22] <CasW> What I want, is when I click on an image, the image loads a new one (from lorempixel.com)
[04:47:55] <larsemil> ah load like retrieve. i see. the ajax call.
[04:51:07] <RK_> hi there
[04:51:42] <RK_> the jquery.com website no longer links to jq mobile, the 2 projects have splitted ?
[04:54:07] <Cork> RK_: i doupt they would split
[04:55:26] <drvanon_> wow, many people online here
[04:55:46] <drvanon_> Will somebody listen to my question?
[04:55:54] <CasW> Of course
[04:56:02] <RK_> ok, thx
[04:56:07] <drvanon_> nice
[04:56:28] <drvanon_> it's  because i want to make something pretty hard
[04:56:44] <drvanon_> and to learn a whole new language is a bit much for me
[04:56:48] <RK_> drvanon_:  shoot :-)
[04:57:07] <drvanon_> what I want to do:
[04:57:32] <drvanon_> If you hover over a lettre the rest should come out of it
[04:57:42] <drvanon_> so you have one big H
[04:57:57] <drvanon_> if you hover over it there should come out o,m and e
[04:58:12] <drvanon_> and that should form a link
[04:58:20] <drvanon_> is that possible?
[04:58:51] <RK_> yes, but might make your page heavy to read, and user experience becomes poor
[04:59:45] <drvanon_> RK_: Why would it?
[04:59:57] <drvanon_> i mean bout the user experience
[05:00:09] <drvanon_> sounds pretty funny to me
[05:01:28] <drvanon_> RK_: and why would it slow the page
[05:01:29] <RK_> drvanon_: because it will look like a xmas tree to the end user ...
[05:01:53] <drvanon_> RK_: oh,
[05:02:03] <drvanon_> RK_: Then you got me wrong
[05:02:26] <drvanon_> RK_: I want it to come OUT of the Tree
[05:02:26] <RK_> drvanon_: depending on the amount of text / elements you'd endup putting a ton of event listeners
[05:03:11] <drvanon_> RK_: And if i make only the H a link
[05:03:19] <drvanon_> oh
[05:03:23] <drvanon_> youre away
[05:03:33] <drvanon_> anybody else knows the answer
[05:03:35] <drvanon_> ?
[05:05:52] <drvanon_> nobody?
[05:07:38] <drvanon_> :-(
[05:09:35] <nVee> hey there, how do I get the value of a checked radio button? I can see if it is checked, but I ahve a group of radio buttons and need to get the value of the checked/selected one
[05:14:38] <xec> nVee: select the checked one with :checked , then do .val()
[05:14:42] <drvanon_> shall i post my question again?
[05:15:24] <xec> nVee: something like $(".radioButtonContainer :checked").val() could work, i think
[05:17:11] <drvanon_> How can I get Jquery to roll/move/etc. letters out of a big letter/image when i hover over it
[05:17:18] <drvanon_> and it must be a link
[05:17:25] <drvanon_> any suggestions?
[05:17:52] <xec> drvanon_: what do you have so far?
[05:18:16] <drvanon_> nothing, i have no experience, they just said, ask the jquery IRC
[05:18:20] <drvanon_> but if you mean website
[05:18:28] <drvanon_> this: www.drvanon.leerik.nl
[05:18:37] <xec> who is "they"
[05:18:57] <Bheam> yo
[05:18:59] <drvanon_> A guy with who i am designing that site
[05:19:19] <Bheam> is there any way to search for elements with a certain css attribute set? or is that not supported by any dom and would be slow as hell?
[05:20:01] <xec> Bheam: just use [attribute]
[05:20:20] <xec> Bheam: like, $('[title]') will select anything with a title attribute
[05:20:21] <drvanon_> xec: The guy with who i am designing that site
[05:20:26] <ximarin> Bheam: $("bla[attribute=]").
[05:20:29] <Bheam> OH I MEANT css style
[05:20:53] <xec> oh, missed the css part
[05:20:59] <Bheam> style="-custom-style: blah blah;"
[05:21:49] <drvanon_> xec: do you know how to do that?
[05:22:26] <xec> drvanon_: not really.. maybe if you had a starting point i could give directions
[05:22:29] <ximarin> hm, tricky, maybe like $("bla").each(function(){ if($(this).css("-custom-style") != "" })
[05:22:44] <Bheam> ximarin: yea but that'd be slow
[05:22:54] <ximarin> Bheam: absolutely
[05:22:56] <Bheam> i suppose my approach is the only one.. i'm pairing the style with a class=""
[05:23:20] <ximarin> why dont you create a special attribute for them?
[05:24:03] <Bheam> won't that ruin all kinds of validation?
[05:24:05] <xec> Bheam: you can do something like [style*="whatever"]
[05:24:10] <ximarin> smth like data-blabla="1" and $("[attribute=data-blabla]").doStuff
[05:24:28] <xec> Bheam: where "whatever" is anything inside the style attribute
[05:24:35] <ximarin> xec does that work?
[05:24:47] <xec> ximarin: havent tested it
[05:24:48] <Cork> Bheam: yes it will be slow as hell
[05:25:29] <Cork> Bheam: to do a css selector you would have to select all elements, then fetch the attribute, then fetch the string, then regex match it for the css value your looking for
[05:25:47] <Cork> Bheam: (this is what the browser have to do)
[05:25:58] <Cork> so you should really be using id's or classes
[05:26:55] <drvanon_> hey you guys know how to make a super big link H where a o, m and e come out
[05:27:09] <ximarin> agree with cork, it has to look the dom all the way down
[05:27:33] <drvanon_> ?
[05:27:52] <Cork> drvanon_: H a o m e??
[05:27:53] <ximarin> at least a class-selector and then look in this pool for the style you need
[05:28:12] <Cork> drvanon_: if thats abrevertions, type it out
[05:28:48] <drvanon_> a ome
[05:28:59] <xec> Cork: i believe he wants it to spell Home when its done :p
[05:29:18] <drvanon_> Cork: A o and a m and a e
[05:29:29] <xec> Cork: as in "a o" = "the letter o" = o
[05:29:31] <ximarin> that is confusing :D
[05:29:38] <Cork> ya...
[05:29:42] <drvanon_> xec: your right
[05:29:49] <drvanon_> sorry h=guys
[05:30:02] <drvanon_> I really need it
[05:30:20] <Cork> drvanon_: you mean you have it to start with an H and the rest of the character be animated out from it?
[05:30:38] <drvanon_> Cork: yes, you know whta I mean
[05:30:42] <ximarin> biuld a div for every char and use .animate
[05:31:07] <ximarin> and let them dance on the screen ^^
[05:31:10] <drvanon_> nice
[05:31:14] <drvanon_> thanks
[05:31:18] <Cork> wouldn't use div though
[05:31:24] <Cork> a span is more correct
[05:32:07] <drvanon_> span? what is a span?
[05:32:16] <ximarin> hm, ok, yes, depends on what to do, if you just want them to show up, you may use spans, to mave them around I would use a div
[05:33:21] <drvanon_> so a div
[05:33:24] <drvanon_> okay
[05:33:35] <drvanon_> gonna search info bout that
[05:33:36] <ximarin> <span>H</span><span>o</span><span>m</span><span>e</span> <-- ow hide the last three spans and then let them show up one after the other
[05:34:32] <dddbmt> Is append() sync?
[05:34:48] <Cork> yes
[05:34:55] <dddbmt> thx (y)

[05:39:20] <drvanon_> ximarin: that's one hack of a website
[05:40:27] <drvanon_> ximarin: how do i edit it in such way it only does dat when i hover over it?
[05:40:31] <drvanon_> $(selector).hover(handlerIn, handlerOut)
[05:40:33] <drvanon_> like that
[05:40:56] <drvanon_> ximarin: but it didn't work when i put it above
[05:42:48] <ximarin> drvanon_: http://jsfiddle.net/BDUZE/6/
[05:43:21] <drvanon_> ximarin: so close
[05:43:34] <drvanon_> let's watch if i can do that to
[05:43:40] <ximarin> you will :)
[05:44:38] <drvanon_> ximarin: http://jsfiddle.net/BDUZE/7/
[05:44:41] <drvanon_> muhahah
[05:47:05] <ximarin> drvanon_: nice :) but try to use .animate and do not hide the spans, but make them transparent
[05:47:27] <ximarin> so they take up the place they need even after 'hiding'
[05:48:01] <drvanon_> ximarin: but, uhm,
[05:48:19] <drvanon_> ximarin: (damn how am i gonna say this?)

[05:51:24] <ximarin> thx drvanon_ ;) it was a good way to pend my last 10 minutes at work today :D
[05:51:41] <pachet> $('td').each(function(){console.log($(this).outerWidth());}) is returning the width of the longest text within that cell's column
[05:51:55] <pachet> i tried making a simple test case, but it's working fine there
[05:52:17] <pachet> any pointers? :[
[05:53:07] <Cork> there http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/5/
[05:53:11] <Cork> now it actaully works
[05:53:47] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody
[05:54:12] <symbolic> Hey
[05:54:12] <Germanaz0> I have a question, about how to set request header on the plugin ajaxForm
[05:54:22] <Germanaz0> I need the X_REQUESTED_WITH headers to be sent
[05:54:34] <xec> Cork: it behaves funny if you hover off and on again rapidly, you end up with stuff like "H  e"
[05:54:43] <Cork> xec: ya
[05:54:53] <Cork> its that it doesn't clean up after its self if you hover it again
[05:55:19] <Cork> oh
[05:55:24] <Cork> and i forgot an if statement XD
[05:56:04] <KOTRET> jquery ui themeroller is down`?
[05:56:15] <KOTRET> i mean the sample page
[05:57:20] <Germanaz0> someone knows how to use jquery ajaxForm plugin ?
[05:57:34] <Germanaz0> bcs is not sending X_REQUESTED headers
[06:00:18] <Cork> man jfiddle is slow...
[06:01:04] <Cork> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/7/
[06:01:05] <Cork> :)
[06:01:11] <Murof> :)
[06:02:01] <Murof> cool
[06:02:08] <xec> same issue still, but the guy left anyway :P
[06:02:36] <Cork> lol
[06:02:42] <Cork> that wasn't really the point
[06:02:47] <Cork> it was just a fun thing :)
[06:03:12] <Cork> xec: the last issue is fixed in 8
[06:03:19] <Cork> forgot to reset the old events
[06:03:51] <cgiGeek> thats cool
[06:04:22] <Murof> I was thinking something like jsfid but to somewhat smart-edit pages or link gdocs to render a page content...
[06:04:25] <aFeijo> hi folks, I have the value from an <select> <option> element, how to position my select in that option?
[06:05:20] <Murof> couldnt understand your situation...
[06:05:40] <aFeijo> Murof, was that msg for me?
[06:05:49] <Murof> hell yeah
[06:05:58] <trevor> If you are looking to get the value for the option... $('select').find(':selected')
[06:06:12] <aFeijo> trevor, no, I want to change the current option in my select
[06:06:16] <aFeijo> the opposite
[06:06:17] <pachet> to answer my own question, i was apparently trying to get the width() on those 'td' elements before they'd been properly rendered in the <tbody>
[06:06:37] <Murof> isnt it by changing the 'selected' property ?
[06:06:45] <pachet> i thought that dom rendering racecases like this weren't present in newer browsers, but i guess i that's not accurate
[06:06:54] <Murof> or even better, the own select element has it
[06:07:50] <aFeijo> I try with $('select').val() and with the selected attribute, I will check again
[06:08:07] <aFeijo> it worked with val(), thanks!
[06:08:32] <Murof> ok :) if you where trying to select the Nth element was like
[06:08:59] <Murof> $(bla).eq(Nth).attr('selected','selected');
[06:09:01] <Murof> val will work
[06:09:06] <Murof> but not sure if in all times :)
[06:09:07] <xec> Cork: i had some fun too ;) http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/9/
[06:09:23] <aFeijo> to my scenario val() will do fine
[06:09:31] <xec> not nearly as cool effect of course
[06:09:32] <Murof> so enjoy
[06:10:01] <xec> and ugly hack requiring to know the size of the first letter :P
[06:10:33] <Murof> oh...text width isnt it
[06:11:12] <aFeijo> lunch break
[06:11:12] <Murof> does you found a way to get it with precision ?
[06:12:23] <xec> Murof: was that to me?
[06:14:35] <Murof> hell yeah :)
[06:14:58] <Murof> xec: I had always trouble with text length
[06:17:00] <aloiscochard> yo peeps
[06:17:28] <aloiscochard> how can I create a selectors than find a <script> with a specific 'src'?
[06:17:51] <aloiscochard> I can do $('script) and have all script, but how to get one with src of '/ajax_request/liftAjax.js' ?
[06:18:46] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/g2bxh9sbrp9f5pb0qhvayw - I have this, which works, however, I have 10 #splint_storlek - do I make a for loop for that or?
[06:19:02] <pachet> $('script[src="/ajax_request/liftAjax.js"]')
[06:19:04] <Murof> I never tried it but you answer me...is SRC one attribute ? ^^
[06:19:06] <pachet> aloiscochard^
[06:19:09] <raj> $("script[src*=mysrc]")
[06:19:13] <Murof> pachet let him discover -_-
[06:19:26] <aloiscochard> pachet++
[06:19:30] <raj> oh right, left out the quotes inside
[06:19:32] <Murof> pachet-- -_-
[06:19:36] <aloiscochard> thanks  guys!!
[06:20:19] <aloiscochard> Murof: you right, I should have found it myself in doc
[06:20:24] * aloiscochard is too lazy
[06:20:29] <raj> Cork, gotta question for you whenever you're free
[06:20:31] <pachet> i never really understood why people wax pedantic
[06:20:51] <Murof> :aloiscochard well the selectors page will be your friend from now on
[06:21:21] <Murof> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:21:22] <Murof> :)
[06:21:55] <kedarm> Is there a jQuery way to do the GitHub-fame "Copy To Clipboard" icon?
[06:22:15] <aloiscochard> Murof: oh way better than http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/jquery-selectors.htm ... I should forget google and go directly in official doc! ty
[06:22:30] <Murof> :aloiscochard np!
[06:23:05] <BMCouto> Hi, why can't i fire a change event on a select with display:none?
[06:23:22] <kedarm> I find it hard to believe that copy to clipboard function uses flash!
[06:23:57] <pachet> Murof: maybe you can nurture your instinct to instruct by helping me with my issue
[06:24:17] <pachet> i'm appending 'td' elements to a table, and i'm wanting to get each td's width immediately after the .append
[06:24:18] <Murof> kedarm: search for window.clipboardData
[06:24:34] <kedarm> Murof: thanks! Found http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[06:25:05] <Murof> pachet: I have no universal knowledge, I would make some tests, by first printing the object returned after the append
[06:25:22] <pachet> but the width returned is different when i first call .width(), vs if i grab the widths in a setTimeout callback to defer outside the current block
[06:25:51] <pachet> but even with setTimeout,  the amount of delay i need to get the correct width is inconsistent
[06:26:05] <Murof> pachet: why would your width change ?
[06:26:07] <pachet> i'm guessing it just fluctuates based on how long it takes the browser to render those elements as table cells
[06:26:46] <scratcha> can anyone suggest how i might optimise the responsive background image animation here: http://tinyurl.com/7r25edg ?
[06:26:51] <Murof> pachet: this could be some stupid question but, is your JS in the footer of your page ?
[06:27:08] <pachet> Murof: nope
[06:27:49] <Murof> pachet: would be good to move it there, yuo could garantee that the JS will be applied only to a rendered page
[06:28:44] <Murof> could give you more browser power to render stuff, after everything
[06:28:57] <Murof> but wuld not solve your append->reading issue
[06:29:40] <jeffreylevesque> hello
[06:29:49] <scratcha> no takers ?
[06:30:16] <Murof> scratcha: didnt look at your link...let's see what you got
[06:30:34] <scratcha> everything works,, I'm just concerned about performance
[06:30:46] <scratcha> rbis.js
[06:30:47] <pachet> Murof: i don't see how that would apply, since I'm adding the 'td's dynamically after page load
[06:31:03] <Murof> pachet: browser workload only, nto solving the append->read
[06:31:11] <scratcha> fairly confident my transitions should be a bit smoother
[06:32:02] <Murof> scartcha: the slider transitions is a bit laggy btw, are you using any equation ?
[06:32:29] <scratcha> the background image slider ?
[06:32:36] <scratcha> or the smaller image slider in the middle ?
[06:32:45] <Murof> pachet: another doubt, are you appending a 'td' with a fixed with, or are you appending it and the content afterwards and letting it flexible ?
[06:33:13] <Murof> scartcha: the smaller, lets see the back
[06:33:25] <Murof> scartcha: the background is a bit more laggy
[06:33:35] <pachet> flex - that's the whole point
[06:33:42] <scratcha> the smaller is using nivo slider,, so I'm confident its OK, i think the performance issues stem from rbis.js
[06:33:46] <Murof> scartcha: Chrome - 16.0.912.75 m
[06:34:00] <scratcha> if you check out that script., the slideToTarget() function is responsible for the animation
[06:34:10] <scratcha> i'm not sure how to go about optimising it
[06:34:47] <bonhoffer> i'm trying to test this: http://jsfiddle.net/PGmFv/2/
[06:35:05] <bonhoffer> but i'm getting XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://raw.github.com/.../my.json. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[06:35:32] <bonhoffer> the json i want to serve is behind a firewall -- any idea how i can get some json?
[06:35:45] <bonhoffer> i guess i could put it in a div tag and pull via html
[06:35:52] <Murof> pachet: that way you fuck me up, you cant set width or height with a flexible content in a one way to go, I would give it some "adjustment" time, to read the browsers changes
[06:36:12] <pachet> yeah, that's exactly what i'm asking
[06:36:19] <pachet> how much adjustment time ;o
[06:37:08] <bonhoffer> I thought github raw would be a good way to pull in json
[06:37:24] <Murof> pachet: If you have bugzilla you can see your pages load time, I would test it several times and see a good timing, will depende in a lot of things, client connection speed, page optimization, content load, etc...
[06:37:49] <Murof> pachet: could get better if you know the content size, that way you could alread add the future contents w/h to the parent
[06:38:06] <pachet> this is more of a general question i guess
[06:38:19] <pachet> on how to avoid racecase between browser repaint and DOM calcs
[06:38:22] <pachet> ;{
[06:38:23] <iamcurio> does anyone know why my image jumps when i hover on javascript? i can provide a link if that helps - just want to know if its the css or that i am using the wrong javascript
[06:38:25] <bonhoffer> i guess i could put the json itself in the $.getJSON("{1,2,3}")
[06:38:40] <Murof> pachet: yeah
[06:39:20] <Murof> pachet: Im doing something like it right now, a dictionary, with 10 elements per letter, and they expand
[06:39:45] <bonhoffer> any thoughts on: http://jsfiddle.net/PGmFv/2/
[06:39:53] <Murof> pachet: But I do have one expected height for each one
[06:40:01] <bonhoffer> I think i'm really close . . . (always close)
[06:41:11] <Murof> scratcha: for you I would look not only for transition effects but, for a animation equation like easiIn, ExpoOut, I was trying to remenber one really good
[06:41:31] <Murof> scratcha: but the name just blured out...
[06:41:35] <scratcha> easing ?
[06:41:45] <Murof> scratcha: yup
[06:41:57] <scratcha> i wonder if that will resolve the issue
[06:42:10] <Murof> scratcha: Ive seen tons of galleries with heavy images sliding like a boss
[06:42:21] <scratcha> yeh ?
[06:42:26] <Murof> scratcha: or at least in chrome they should
[06:42:27] <iamcurio> does anyone know a good full width carousel like on the gucci site: http://www.gucci.com/uk/category/m/bags#look635564lookA113 ? really need one
[06:43:34] <Murof> scratcha: I see...when your website is free it slides good enough, but when the middle slider start to transit its image, the background becomes laggy
[06:44:18] <Murof> iamcurio: Id try to type this exactly same thing on uncle google, 100% width jquery carousel or just jquery carousel :)
[06:44:55] <scratcha> Murof: thats it,, i don't understand why :(
[06:44:55] <Murof> iamcurio: u will find tons of webdesign source websites, you m ay find even things you will need later
[06:46:49] <Murof> scratcha: its related to code optimization and of course browser rendering
[06:47:26] <Murof> scratcha: if only one rendering is not 100% imagine the browser moving 2 big images
[06:48:07] <Murof> scratcha: thats the why I though about the easing, with a more dry animation code, you could lessen the weight on your page
[06:48:37] <Murof> scratcha: btw nice design, 960grid ?
[06:49:38] <iamcurio> Murof: i can't seem to find anything with a scroll bar as well or that still have the other images visible on the side of the carousel
[06:53:33] <bonhoffer> http://jsfiddle.net/PGmFv/7/ <-- even closer (i think)
[06:53:50] <bonhoffer> any thoughts greatly appreciated
[06:54:03] <Murof> iamcurio: your would be more a content slider...
[06:54:16] <Murof> bonhoffer: gonna take a look soon
[06:54:26] <bonhoffer> if i manually load the events array it works fine
[06:54:47] <g[r]eek> Hi guys I am having a problem with jQuery ui dialogs. Example: index.php has a link to form.php, which when clicked, opens form.php in a fancybox. This form, when submitted, has it's validation errors outputted in a jQuery ui dialog. However for some reason everytime I click on the form link and then submit an invalid form, the dialog object is recreated and I end up stacking on dialog on top of the next. Any ideas where I can start look
[06:54:48] <g[r]eek> ing? If there are no ideas based on my abstract description then I'll put together a pastebin
[06:54:56] <iamcurio> Murof: any ones you would recommend for the full width?
[06:55:40] <g[r]eek> I've tried calling dialog("destroy") before I initialise the dialog in form.php, but this doesn't help
[06:55:57] <g0th> hi
[06:56:01] <g[r]eek> (my think was along the lines of "If exists, delete; Then create"
[06:56:19] <g0th> I have something like  <div class="foo"><div class="bar"/></div>
[06:56:23] <Murof> iamcurio: customize this one -> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/10/07/slider-gallery/
[06:56:31] <g0th> how do I select the class "bar" inside "foo" ?
[06:56:59] <g0th> e.g. a "bar" inside a "foo2" should not be selected
[06:57:20] <Murof> iamcurio: could give you a nice result, alread have the scroll, the arrows, and you customize the content, I didnt take a long look in it but, its something like that you need :)
[06:58:02] <Dexec> Gentlemen, how can I use the starts with AND ends with selectors for checking the same name?
[06:58:32] <Murof> bonhoffer: taking a look at your link...
[06:58:51] <iamcurio> Murof: sweet looks like that could work
[06:58:56] <anli_> What is a good choice for "custom"?
[06:59:01] <anli_> :)
[06:59:02] <bonhoffer> i have a running example, but i want to work with getJSON, and i can't get that to work
[06:59:16] <g[r]eek> g0th, $("div.foo div.bar")
[06:59:30] <bonhoffer> Murof: for example, this works fine
[06:59:31] <bonhoffer> http://jsfiddle.net/Zrz9t/2/
[06:59:36] <Murof> iamcurio: good to know :)
[06:59:39] <Dexec> I've tried this: var results = $('#myDiv').children('[name^="thisIsTheStart"]', '[name$="thisIsTheEnd"]');
[06:59:47] <bonhoffer> Murof: but this does not: http://jsfiddle.net/PGmFv/7/
[06:59:47] <Dexec> and this   I've tried this: var results = $('#myDiv').children('[name^="thisIsTheStart"]').('[name$="thisIsTheEnd"]');
[07:01:03] <Murof> bonhoffer: looking, your talking just about the events ?
[07:01:33] <bonhoffer> Yes, i'm just trying to get events to load via JSON instead of an explicit variable
[07:01:59] <Murof> Not event taking a longer look, I would try to see if there are 2 methods of doing it
[07:02:28] <Murof> one method is the before the instance was born and the other is after the instance
[07:02:40] <g0th> thx
[07:03:10] <iamcurio> Murof: one last thingâ€¦ have you seen any where you have for example 3 always visible in the middle and then the ones on the edge and faded out and unclickable ?
[07:03:10] <Murof> like normally all jqueryUI components have the the ('options','xxxx') attribute so you can manipulate afterwards
[07:04:12] <Murof> iamcurio: only in flash Ive seen it, but you can for sure, do it in jquery, by adding classes and removing classes
[07:05:26] <_ramo> hi
[07:05:37] <_ramo> is there a jquery function to escape html strings?
[07:05:45] <_ramo> and that is crossbrowser compatible?
[07:06:32] <Murof> _ramo: tried to look for jquery escape string ?
[07:14:13] <bonhoffer> Murof: are you saying "one method is the before the instance was born and the other is after the instance" to recommend i put the getJSON elsewhere in my function
[07:14:33] <bonhoffer> i would recommend before . . . if I can do it
[07:14:42] <bonhoffer> but i might have several calendars on a page
[07:14:53] <bonhoffer> so i wanted to use this.id to select the data
[07:15:24] <Uriziel> how to check if image has not loaded properly (i.e. not found)?
[07:18:03] <drvanon_> hey guys

[07:19:26] <drvanon_> why?
[07:19:51] <xec> what do you mean
[07:19:51] <drvanon_> does my server need software?
[07:20:01] <drvanon_> hey xec
[07:20:20] <xec> what's the site, what happens?
[07:20:36] <drvanon_> xec: well i wrote that bit of code in to the html
[07:20:50] <xec> do you have a url?
[07:20:59] <drvanon_> drvanon.leerik.nl
[07:21:07] <drvanon_> it's not even near done
[07:21:09] <drvanon_> but
[07:21:51] <xec> what's supposed to happen, and where did you put the script
[07:21:57] <drvanon_> http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/1/
[07:22:05] <drvanon_> that's supposed to happen
[07:22:20] <xec> on the left menu?
[07:22:39] <drvanon_> xec:
[07:22:47] <drvanon_> xec: got the problem
[07:22:58] <computer2000> help pls: i need to remove all <a href...> elements, leaving only its html content... how?
[07:23:00] <drvanon_> xec: my mate did'nt put in
[07:23:12] <drvanon_> xec: where should he do that?
[07:23:24] <computer2000> so <a href="dddfaaf">blabla</a> becomes blabla
[07:43:26] <Jonno_FTW> how can I select all rows from a table, excluding the first row
[07:43:26] <Jonno_FTW> ?
[07:58:48] <Murof> If my multi-page/search-like dictionary works gonna do it as a plugin for large collections
[07:59:35] <gregory___> hmm, I have a tricky problem
[08:00:29] <gregory___> I have an ajax site, that dynamically loads the main part of the webpage
[08:01:01] <gregory___> when it loads that (or changes the main part), I want the loaded file to include some js that then gets called.
[08:01:54] <Murof> and wheres the problem ?
[08:01:55] <rogeruiz> so on completion of the ajax request?
[08:01:59] <rogeruiz> or some time later on?
[08:04:05] <rogeruiz> gregory___: fiddle up some example
[08:04:19] <gregory___> roger_raymond, yep, on completion of the ajax request
[08:04:26] <gregory___> I'm trying a new tactic now...
[08:04:46] <tehfedaykin> has anyone seen any good discussions anywhere on how http://www.newzealand.com/int/ works?
[08:05:55] <Murof> tehfedaykin: why "how" it works ?
[08:06:25] <tehfedaykin> I want to do something similar to the way there is a new image for each scroll event
[08:07:06] <tehfedaykin> and not quite sure where to start
[08:07:06] <Murof> well...you have the scroll event, and you have a fixed background, you have a nice preloading before everything starts and well compressed images
[08:07:09] <Murof> what else ?
[08:07:26] <mantas322> okay
[08:07:30] <mantas322> I have a question
[08:07:45] <mantas322> why is jquery.js preventing my refular javascript functions
[08:08:00] <Jonno_FTW> If I have $("tr").each(function() {... } how do I get the name attribute of the first td in each tr ?
[08:08:04] <Murof> masntas322: shouldnt
[08:08:46] <Murof> Jonno_FTW: $(this).find('td').first() would solve if yuor not talking about performance...
[08:08:58] <mantas322> claims they are "undefined"
[08:09:12] <mantas322> but when i exclude the jq.js file it works
[08:09:14] <mantas322> hmmm
[08:09:15] <mantas322> :/
[08:09:20] <Jonno_FTW> Murof: thanks, the row only has 5 cells, so I don't think it will matter
[08:09:28] <mantas322> I'm clearly not understanding some jquery fundimentals here
[08:09:31] <Murof> tried not only declaring they inside the ready() statement but inside a variable ?
[08:09:50] <pachet> mantas322: are you trying to call native functions on the jq object :[
[08:09:58] <mantas322> no
[08:10:08] <mantas322> I simply have a function which redirects
[08:10:13] <Murof> mantas322: cant imagine your situation
[08:10:25] <mantas322> but when the .js file is included it claims its not defined
[08:10:30] <mantas322> on mobile browsers
[08:11:08] <pachet> mantas322: sounds like your functions were declared in a different scope
[08:11:10] <Murof> mantas322: any function you call he returns undefined for you ?
[08:11:10] <mantas322> on all browsers....... I mist be doing something wrong
[08:11:22] <mantas322> how can that be? isnt the entire scope just tyhe page?
[08:11:52] <Murof> mantas322: try declaring then inside $(function(){ ...
[08:11:54] <mantas322> yes Murof, just one function containing a windo2w.location redirect
[08:12:09] <Murof> mantas322: do some tests and tell us the results
[08:12:14] <mantas322> i've been reading this http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/16/jquery-examples-and-best-practices/
[08:12:22] <Murof> mantas322: hum...
[08:12:44] <pachet> >> (function(){function foo(){//};})(); foo @ mantas322
[08:12:57] <kampsun> Hmm. I have a code, that gets json object by ajax request and fills some inputs. Weird thing is, it only works if I had breakpoints to the $(input).val(ajaxdata) spots in firebug. Hat might give?
[08:13:11] <pachet> bleh, can't remember the trigger for bot-t
[08:13:18] <pachet> if he even has one
[08:13:41] <kampsun> If I don't add breakpoints I can see that I can get data, but it isn't to the input value
[08:13:55] <kampsun> isn't added*
[08:13:55] <Murof> kampsun: code timeline, you code is being executed before some stuff, try moving all code to the bottom of the page
[08:14:23] <kampsun> I think it allready is
[08:14:54] <Murof> kampsun: is the input.val() called after ajax return ?
[08:15:05] <Murof> success: function(){ ... ?
[08:15:52] <sven_oostenbrink> http://pastebin.com/gqzizTAW Anybody an idea what this is about? I select a <div> that has child divs, but for the love of me, I can not select these child divs! .children() returns nothing, .find() returns nothing either..
[08:16:13] <Jonno_FTW> Murof: I get undefined when I do var id = $(this).find('td').first().attr("name");
[08:16:20] <sven_oostenbrink>  (Pastebin contains jQuery code and console.log output)
[08:16:22] <symbolic> kampsun: put your code on jsfiddle
[08:16:23] <Jonno_FTW> but the name should be 1
[08:16:54] <sven_oostenbrink> The div I select, and the sub divs as well, were added to the DOM by jQuery dynamically
[08:16:57] <Murof> Jonno: try 'alerting' the element, for example, alert ->  $(this).find('td').first().html()
[08:17:12] <Murof> Jonno: and so you will find yourself in the code
[08:17:38] <sven_oostenbrink> Als, if I console.log the jQuery object, I get the div and the sub divs, but if I console.log the object.html(), I get an empty string? how is that possible?
[08:17:45] <sven_oostenbrink> (demonstrated in the pastebin as well)
[08:18:09] <symbolic> sven: whats the style attibute on parent div?
[08:18:27] <intangir> what selector do i use to find a child element of a table with a certain class.. im using 'td:nth-child(1)' but i only want to get the first td of a cerain table with a specific class (the td doesnt have a special class)
[08:18:43] <sven_oostenbrink> symbolic: not sure, I didn't add style.. It might be related?
[08:18:44] <Jonno_FTW> Murof: I figured it out, i didn't want the cell, I wanted the link within it!
[08:18:54] <Ezep> Sorry, this is jQueryUI's support channel too? or only jQuery?
[08:18:55] <intangir> not all tables on page.
[08:19:31] <sphinxxx> how do i force a script to load synchronously?
[08:19:35] <sphinxxx> when i'm appending it to the head
[08:19:36] <sven_oostenbrink> symbolic: What I have done, though, is .hide() and .show() that div
[08:19:39] <Murof> Jonno: good :)
[08:20:04] <erichynds> sphinxxx: document.write
[08:20:15] <Murof> Jonno: dont know how you achieved but you can dry it to find('td > a')
[08:20:51] <Jonno_FTW> how is that different from find('td a') ?
[08:21:06] <Paolo85> Hello
[08:21:26] <Paolo85> I'm starting a new project in a couple of months
[08:21:28] <mantas322> this is so bizzare
[08:21:33] <Paolo85> and I want to use jquery
[08:21:49] <Paolo85> I was wondering if someone can suggest an up to date tutorial
[08:22:04] <Paolo85> to start from 0 having already a good knowledge of JS
[08:22:27] <sven_oostenbrink> symbolic2: That is still you?
[08:22:32] <danzik171> Jonno_FTW: one is a descendant selector, one is a children selector.  see http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:22:39] <Jonno_FTW> Paolo85: the mozilla reference is a good one
[08:22:54] <techouse> man...what on earth was i thinking using ajax to return whole chunks of html instead of json data :/
[08:22:56] <sven_oostenbrink> symbolic2: Anyway, also tried selectors like $('#ISChatUsers_' + room + ' > div'), same result, nothing..
[08:23:04] <techouse> rawr.....redo :P
[08:23:34] <Murof> Jonno: its different in the meaning of '>' means containing or so, 'td > a' would be something like 'A td element containing one 'a' element", I dont know if theres a workaround using space or not :) but the "explicit" way is using '>'
[08:23:50] <sven_oostenbrink> mantas322: IRC?
[08:23:50] <Murof> Jonno: *one or more :)
[08:24:22] <mantas322> no
[08:24:31] <mantas322> my jquery confusion and rage
[08:24:36] <intangir> what selector do i use to find a child element of a table with a certain class.. im using 'td:nth-child(1)' but i only want to get the first td of a cerain table with a specific class (the td doesnt have a special class)
[08:25:05] <Paolo85> Thank you!
[08:25:10] <mantas322> OoooooooH!
[08:26:00] <sven_oostenbrink> Same here.. Why is my selector returning a div with sub divs, and selecting the children (or find or whatever) returns nothing?!
[08:26:02] <buremba> I want to select only an element's children not other descendants, how can I do that?
[08:26:08] <Murof> intangir: (your-table[class=your-class] > td).eq(child-number) or .first() or just use the class name....
[08:26:17] <gregory___> rogeruiz, Murof, see http://www.nomoregrapes.com/test/index.html and page1.html (view source code) for what I want to do.
[08:27:01] <Murof> gregory: i saw it
[08:27:21] <kampsun> Murof: input.val() is called in a $.get()'s success callback.
[08:27:55] <Murof> gregory: if you want to uso js after its loaded change your load to -> .load('url', function(){...code after load });
[08:28:14] <techouse> intangir: not how nth-child works in jq
[08:28:36] <techouse> it gets ALL the children into an array and gets the 1st element
[08:28:43] <gregory___> Murof, any idea how I could achieve that then, or am I asking for too much?
[08:29:02] <rogeruiz> gregory___
[08:29:05] <Murof> kampsun: try 'alerting' the contents of 'data' to see if you figure something out
[08:29:16] <techouse> intangir: so you have 2 options: cut down useless child nodes or add a class to that thing you want selected
[08:29:37] <buremba> anyone: I want to select only an element's children not other descendants, how can I do that?
[08:29:46] <gregory___> rogeruiz, yes?
[08:29:54] <ajpiano> buremba: use .children()
[08:29:59] <rogeruiz> gregory___, the .load has the ability to use a func called complete()
[08:30:04] <gregory___> oh, I'm not noticing all messages (will read up)
[08:30:07] <Murof> gregory: $(".content").load( $(this).attr("href"), functino(){ ... Try calling your js functions here ... } );
[08:30:10] <rogeruiz> .load( url [, data] [, complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)] )
[08:30:27] <rogeruiz> you want to put your completion code within that complete func
[08:30:48] <rogeruiz> gregory___, complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)A callback function that is executed when the request completes. is this what you are looking for?
[08:30:51] <Murof> rogeruiz: try reading too so you dont flood with double information
[08:31:03] <rogeruiz> Murof, sorry
[08:31:17] <Murof> rogeruiz: nop
[08:31:37] <sven_oostenbrink> http://pastebin.com/gqzizTAW I am getting desperatly crazy here.. Why is it that I can select the div, but not its children? I already tried giving a unique class name to the child divs, and selecting on that class, but I still can not select them.. What could I possibly be doing wrong here?
[08:31:53] <kampsun> .. Just ike that started working. Maybe it was just a server hiccup.
[08:32:07] <buremba> ajpiano: I will it jQuery.each and "$('parent').childrens().each(function()" doesn't work. :/
[08:32:18] <Murof> sven: jsfiddle it
[08:32:19] <buremba> it must be in one selector
[08:32:20] <ajpiano> buremba: it's children() not childrens()
[08:32:40] <Murof> kampsun: try some use cases to garantee it
[08:35:13] <danzik171> given a selector like div:foo:bar:baz - anyone happen to know what order the pseudos are processed in?
[08:36:47] <Murof> danzik171: I would guess left-to-right
[08:37:04] <Murof> danzik171: or parent-to-child
[08:37:08] <intangir> wow inernet exporer is being extremely inconsistent about selecting nth-child elements
[08:38:09] <gregory___> rogeruiz, Murof, ah yes putting it in the complete function (and not commenting out the function call, duh) makes it work, thanks
[08:38:25] <rogeruiz> gregory___ any time
[08:38:33] <gregory___> my actual code is more complicated, but I can work in a complete function now I know I need to do that
[08:38:38] <gregory___> makes sense actually
[08:38:50] <Murof> gregory: should make
[08:39:31] <symbolic2> Sven: post your code and html on jsfiddle.net
[08:40:17] <Murof> symbolic2: alread told it, guess hes doing it...
[08:40:44] <symbolic2> Sven: that way we can actually run it
[08:40:55] <symbolic2> Ok
[08:41:08] <z0ned> <img id="test" class="t" src="test.jpg" />    $("#test") does not return an HTMLImageElement ... furthermore, $(img.t).each(function() { console.log(this);)}) .... DOES give me an HTMLImageElement.  why?
[08:42:30] <sven_oostenbrink> If I use append() to add an element with class "x" to the DOM with jQuery, will jQuery then later be able to select on that element with $('.x') ? Dumb question, but it seems now that jQuery appends elements, but after that, is completely unable to find these same elements again..
[08:42:39] <Murof> z0ned: try consoling $(this) not this
[08:42:56] <ajpiano> z0ned: because jQuery selections return jQuery objects, whereas inside of a jQuery.each loop it gives you a DOM element
[08:43:01] <ajpiano> as 'this'
[08:43:06] <z0ned> ahh.
[08:43:13] <Murof> z0ned: or change the upper guy to get(0);
[08:43:28] <Murof> z0ned: and there you have yuor DOM element...
[08:43:39] <Murof> z0ned: like ajpiano said...
[08:44:03] <z0ned> makes sense, figured out my problem. thx
[08:44:22] <Murof> z0ned: thank yourself for understanding ^^
[08:45:42] <goldstar> I have the following input <input type="text"  name="email" /> and am using $('input[name="email"]').val() to get its value, but its returning undefined. ideas ?
[08:46:18] <mantas322> WHY!
[08:46:23] <mantas322> WHY undefined
[08:46:28] <techouse> intangir: anything below IE9 and nth-child is impossible, unless you use selctivizr.js
[08:46:37] <techouse> or the adjacent css selector
[08:46:45] <techouse> which is VERY impractical
[08:46:52] <Murof> goldstar: cant imagine it not working
[08:47:06] <goldstar> Murof, wasnt in document.ready
[08:47:08] <goldstar> :)
[08:47:53] <Murof> goldstar: try looking harder next time :)
[08:48:09] <drvanon_> okay
[08:48:13] <drvanon_> new problem
[08:48:18] <drvanon_> who wants one?
[08:48:21] <Murof> mantas322: put it already in jsfiddle...
[08:48:35] <Murof> drvanon: just throw it in the ground
[08:48:40] <drvanon_> okay
[08:48:44] <drvanon_> i have a site
[08:48:48] <Murof> drvanon: but if its something easy you pay me a coffee

[08:48:59] <drvanon_> ooh, shit
[08:49:09] <drvanon_> then i'll shut my mouth
[08:49:18] <drvanon_> I'm new to jquery
[08:49:22] <Murof> drvanon: let me guess, is it about your menu ?
[08:49:34] <drvanon_> lookalike
[08:49:36] <drvanon_> howcome?
[08:49:56] <drvanon_> anyway, the question
[08:50:07] <drvanon_> i have one beatiful menu
[08:50:13] <drvanon_> (i really like it)
[08:50:23] <amok> hi there
[08:50:26] <drvanon_> but now it starts with the top
[08:50:28] <amok> Using JQ-UI
[08:50:34] <symbolic2> Goldstar: set an empty value= attri in the input tag
[08:50:42] <drvanon_> and if i want to select the under one
[08:50:43] <Murof> drvanon: hum...
[08:50:48] <drvanon_> he has to open them all
[08:50:54] <drvanon_> I no like that
[08:51:14] <symbolic2> I tried it and it worked for me
[08:51:35] <Murof> symbolic2: read the conversation...he alread solved it ^^
[08:51:39] <drvanon_> Murof: Any suggestions>
[08:51:53] <drvanon_> who me?
[08:51:56] <Murof> drvanon: can you tell me how are you telling the fonts to animate?
[08:52:10] <amok> Using JQ-UI - when using BUTTONSET, I call onclick action. But RADIO changes its values AFTER my custom action triggered..Is there any method like "after COMPLETE" or something like this ?
[08:52:21] <LukeNukem> Hello
[08:52:26] <amok> LukeNukem, hello )
[08:52:30] <LukeNukem> im trying to echo php text inside a jquery plugin
[08:52:33] <LukeNukem> but its not working.
[08:52:52] <Murof> drvanon: looking your js...
[08:52:54] <amok> yes.. coz PHP doesnt process js scripts
[08:53:12] <LukeNukem> umm err
[08:53:20] <amok> but if your JS script is in PHP script, it might work
[08:53:20] <LukeNukem> :(
[08:53:26] <LukeNukem> js script is inside a php script
[08:53:42] <drvanon_> Murof: http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/1/
[08:53:44] <amok> HEY PEOPLE !! Really need help with JQUERY UI
[08:53:44] <drvanon_> this way
[08:53:45] <LukeNukem> done it before with jquery UI, but im using a plugin
[08:53:55] <Murof> drvanon: thanks :)
[08:54:05] <amok> LukeNukem, maybe you should escape text ?
[08:54:12] <drvanon_> Murof: graag gedaan
[08:54:21] <LukeNukem> wait
[08:54:47] <LukeNukem> ok i was using <?php echo implode($text); ?>
[08:55:02] <LukeNukem> when i got rid of $implode, i got array..as output..the array has strings
[08:55:03] <drvanon_> Murof: wait
[08:55:11] <Murof> drvanon: yes ?
[08:55:16] <drvanon_> Murof: that's just one
[08:55:29] <Murof> drvanon: I duplicated here
[08:55:39] <drvanon_> Murof: ahh, sorry , said nothing
[08:55:44] <Murof> drvanon: http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/13/
[08:55:52] <Murof> drvanon: using this example
[08:57:14] <Murof> drvanon: how should it behave?
[08:59:46] <kampsun> about my ajax and form problem. It seems it's still dodgy, working and not working seemingly "randomly".
[09:00:26] <Murof> kampsun: thats the why I told you to test it more before moving to production
[09:01:07] <Murof> kampsun: to workaround it you could delay with setTimeout with 500 should be good
[09:01:23] <symbolic> Yuck
[09:01:24] <kampsun> Murof: Fortunately 'production' isn't something critical. Yeah, I thought about timeout
[09:01:28] <Murof> kampsun: but the best thing to do is to read all your code, theres something our of order
[09:01:49] <mehale> is there a changelog from 1.7x to 1.5.x?
[09:01:49] <mehale> var height = Math.ceil ( $('iframe').contents().find('#widgetcontainer').attr('scrollHeight') / 10 ) * 10 + 15; /// used to work and stopped when I moved to 1.7.1 -- now is NaN
[09:02:26] <LukeNukem> hello, it has worked but i was wondering if its possible to change the height of the popup according to the php text ;s
[09:02:52] <ajpiano> mehale: try using .prop("scrollHeight")
[09:03:00] <mehale> ah, thanks
[09:04:30] <LukeNukem> can someone answer my question
[09:06:17] <tehfedaykin> can you explain more LukeNukem
[09:06:34] <LukeNukem> um im using this php notifcations plugin to echo out errors after form processing
[09:06:53] <LukeNukem> suppose there are a lot of errors, there is not enough space to echo on the notifcation bar
[09:06:54] <LukeNukem> so it looks ugly
[09:06:56] <LukeNukem> like this
[09:06:56] <tehfedaykin> and what do you want to do
[09:07:46] <LukeNukem> http://gyazo.com/edf76f2f30a68d1e54a1de7ff2a293a2
[09:12:45] <mantas322> omg
[09:12:49] <mantas322> what the hell just happened
[09:13:31] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/X4KpMHpr
[09:13:37] <LukeNukem> can anybody tell me what that code does
[09:14:28] <Eviltwin> Negates the div's height?
[09:14:42] <Eviltwin> Oh
[09:14:44] <Eviltwin> No
[09:14:47] <Eviltwin> Sets the top to the negative height
[09:14:55] <Eviltwin> So the bottom is right at the top of the parent
[09:15:10] <Eviltwin> This is how you hide an element so that it can slide in from the top
[09:15:12] <LukeNukem> o.o
[09:15:17] <LukeNukem> does that mess with the height of my div?
[09:15:23] <sphinxxx> no
[09:15:24] <LukeNukem> i mean does it change the height values?
[09:15:25] <Eviltwin> No, just the top
[09:15:46] <LukeNukem> ok so i want to set the notifcation height to be auto, that is according to the text inside it..
[09:15:50] <Eviltwin> This could also be done as var div = $("div#info_message"); div.css("top", -div.height());
[09:16:01] <LukeNukem> i tried removing height attribute in css but that does not do it
[09:16:07] <LukeNukem> set it to height: auto;
[09:16:09] <LukeNukem> but no luck
[09:16:14] <LukeNukem> so how do i doi t?
[09:16:57] <Murof> drvanon: except for the animations, this is more simple, try to customize it: http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/16/

[09:20:37] <Murof> Ezep: who knows ? I came here to discuss something and ended helping
[09:20:43] <Murof> Ezep: just bring the problem
[09:20:53] <Ezep> Murof: that's the IRC spirit my friend
[09:21:12] <Murof> Ezep: hope so :)
[09:21:28] <objNoob> Hi - I'm using <td><a href='#' onclick='showComments(this.parentNode.parentNode)'><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-comment"/></a></td>
[09:21:43] <objNoob> In IE 8 that shows two comment icons in the table cell :(
[09:23:37] <Ezep> The 'problem' (or my ignorance) is with jQueryUI's datepicker. When I change days's background color (or any css attribute with jQuery.css) the changes remains, but when I do an action (like click over a day or change month) is like the datepicker refresh it's content
[09:24:00] <Murof> Ezep: hum...
[09:24:03] <Ezep> Is there a way to not restore the default state of the widget?
[09:24:39] <Murof> Ezep: my own experience, I changed all the colours I needed in the themeroller
[09:24:43] <Ezep> I'm using a color picker to change the color of many elements of the datepicker
[09:24:48] <Murof> Ezep: tried once, redeclaring the ui-default classes

[09:28:55] <Ezep> Custom (and very plain)
[09:29:11] <Murof> Ezep: and the ui.js is pointing to it too ? the themmed js version
[09:30:02] <Ezep> Emm, no.. are not the js the same?
[09:30:19] <Murof> Ezep: I dont think so, try changing to test
[09:30:27] <Ezep> Good idea, brb
[09:30:30] <Murof> theres one ui.js in yuor theme
[09:30:35] <Murof> k :)
[09:31:00] <sven_oostenbrink> Can I select display: none (hidden) elements?
[09:31:43] <Murof> sven: with js yes, if not, how could you turn then visible again? ^^
[09:32:24] <Murof> sven: but if your talking about selecting them in your page, the answer is no, display:none means not rendering it anymore
[09:35:22] <Ezep> Murof: no way !, I tried too with demos in ui's website (I used this: $('#Calendar .ui-widget-content a.ui-state-default').css('color','#000000' ) (too short to pastebin)
[09:35:34] <Ezep> Sorry, remove the #Calendar
[09:36:01] <Murof> Ezep: and he returned to the default colour ?
[09:36:07] <Ezep> Murof: yes
[09:37:57] <Murof> Ezep: almost funny :)
[09:38:28] <park> sup, i am getting a strange result using the animate function i was wondering if someone had some insite
[09:38:36] <Murof> Ezep: I would look for something like "changing jquery-ui theme color dynamically"
[09:38:52] <BFranks> So I enabled my debugger, I clicked to insert a breakpoint on the line after the error.. it moved the breakpoint to the end of the function? I refresh the page.. nothing new.. I clicked 2 lines under the error, that inserted a breakpoint, I reload the page.. nothing new in the scope variables.. I can't "pause" it just says "pausing" .. I need help with the help
[09:39:11] <Ezep> Murof: my boss wouldn't this is funny, haha !
[09:39:17] <park> i am animating the heights on multiple objects but often the height on two of the objects become out of sync with the rest
[09:39:25] <Ezep> think*
[09:39:46] <park> i call stop(true , true) on all objects
[09:40:17] <park> if i just use the css function instead of animate there is not a problem
[09:40:34] <sven_oostenbrink> Murof: Thing is, I am selecting a DIV which is hidden, but for some reason I cant select its child elements...
[09:41:43] <Murof> Ezep: Thnking here, look for a way, to change your theme
[09:42:26] <Murof> sven: build your code here and send us -> http://jsfiddle.net
[09:42:29] <Ezep> Murof: thanks ! I will keep investigating
[09:44:07] <Murof> Ezep: ok, and I do have a guess why he does overwrite, because he will dynamically use addClass, the class that is inside the CSS file, that way, the changes you made by using the .css attribute will be loss
[09:44:09] <Murof> lost*
[09:44:44] <Murof> Ezep: thats the most logical conclusion
[09:45:08] <Murof> park: use jsfiddle to show your problem more conciselly
[09:46:01] <Ezep> Murof: yes, I thinked that the behavior of the 'onclick' event over the day was doing something like this
[09:46:43] <Ezep> Maybe I'm missing a method or something more jqueryuified
[09:49:46] <sphinxxx> i need jsonp help :(
[09:49:51] <Murof> Ezep: yes something that would maintani the class you modified or call the addClass everytime, just like controlling the object after instantiated with ('options'
[09:50:39] <sphinxxx> does a php page have to return the json,  or can it just be a .json file?
[09:52:28] <Murof> sphinxxx: depends the way you are doing things...
[09:53:16] <Murof> sphinxxx: with php you yill just echo the return in json_encode(...) and the $.ajax call will be of dataType: 'json'
[09:53:19] <BFranks> Oh nevermind JSFiddle won't load my work either now.. http://jsfiddle.net/LzJPL/3/
[09:53:34] <Murof> sphinxxx: with file you will make a diff move, by using something like getJSON()
[09:53:43] <Murof> sphinxxx: look for those ^^
[09:54:29] <Murof> BFranks: what where you expecting from your code ?
[09:55:10] <Murof> BFranks: remove that google load, you have all the lbiraries at your left
[09:55:14] <Murof> worked for me :)
[09:55:27] <Murof> BFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/LzJPL/4/
[09:55:42] <donCams> hello
[09:56:37] <Murof> donCams: hello
[09:57:05] <sven_oostenbrink> What is faster? $('a > b') or $('a', 'b') or $(a).find(b) ?
[09:57:07] <donCams> i have a text area and i need to insert some string to where the cursor is in the textarea (similar to an editor). any tips?
[09:57:30] <BFranks> Murof: Ahhh thanks.. Now back to why this gives me errors on my local setup.. Probably be back here in 30 mins going 'yep it's fer sure broke how do I insert a breakpoint so I can see why it's saying TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'selectable'
[09:57:49] <oliver_g> hello
[09:58:26] <shoelessone> hey guys! q: I have a form that has a drop down menu with potentially 1-150 items in the drop down. I don't have control over the backend or rendering of the page, but I was asked to create some sort of "search" if the drop down contains > 10 elements. I was wondering if anybody had any advice as to how they would go about it.
[09:58:27] <Murof> sven: I would go with 'a > b'
[09:58:41] <muhoo> is it really still true that keycode doesn't work on firefox?
[09:58:58] <Eviltwin> shoelessone: Perhaps http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ ?
[09:59:11] <oliver_g> I'd like to apply a filter function to a set of elements, and show() all matching elements, and hide() all non-matching ones... what would be the fastest implementation?
[09:59:12] <Murof> donCams: look for something like appending to selected position, appending to cursor, something like this
[09:59:13] <muhoo> one of the first hits on google was an article stating that it doesn't. maybe it's very old?
[09:59:23] <shoelessone> Eviltwin: omg. Could it really be this easy!?
[09:59:43] <Eviltwin> oliver_g: Just hide all elements then show the matching ones
[09:59:49] <BFranks> Really.. "Object [object Object] has no method 'selectable'" should be a problem with includes?
[09:59:56] <Murof> BFrank: no method selectable, means either your not under Jquery ready function, or didint loaded the library
[10:00:04] <BFranks> like there's a Jquery function not loaded?
[10:00:05] <Eviltwin> BFranks: Where is the error coming form?
[10:00:07] <Eviltwin> from*
[10:00:11] <Eviltwin> Give the relevant section of code
[10:00:18] <oliver_g> Eviltwin: with ~5000 <li> elements the initial hide() seems to be rather slow
[10:00:40] <Ezep> Murof: that would be great... or a way to take the style each time the datepicker 'refresh'
[10:00:43] <Eviltwin> oliver_g: In what browser?
[10:00:55] <Eviltwin> And why do you have 5000 LIs
[10:00:57] <NoiseEee> oliver_g: the problem is display 5000 <li> elements, period!!
[10:01:04] <oliver_g> Firefox 3.6 (it's what we have to work with)
[10:01:06] <sphinxxx> but murof, can i use a .json when i'm requesting it with ajax, using jsonp?
[10:01:07] <Murof> oliver: try changing hide to css display:none and test
[10:01:21] <sphinxxx> so for example, i have a .json file that exists on another server
[10:01:23] <oliver_g> Eviltwin: and there are 5000 elements possible, but usually filtered down to ~100
[10:01:39] <sphinxxx> and i need to access it through an ajax request on another domain
[10:01:48] <Murof> sphinxxx: never tried, but shouldnt exist this limitations
[10:02:03] <Murof> sphinxxx: because lots of webservices does it
[10:02:15] <sphinxxx> i thought with jsonp you had to use a backend language like php
[10:02:29] <oliver_g> Murof: I'll try that!
[10:02:40] <Murof> sphinxxx: there must be someone to get your request
[10:02:50] <BFranks> Eviltwin: It's pointing to this  http://jsfiddle.net/hCTJd/1/  (Marked with ------>  )  when it says "Object [object Object] has no method 'selectable'"
[10:02:51] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: By .json do you mean a static file with the suffix ".json"?
[10:03:14] <Murof> sphinxxx: just like the webservice is in server-side language and answers you
[10:03:29] <Eviltwin> BFranks: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:03:34] <Eviltwin> So that doesn't work for you?
[10:03:59] <BFranks> Eviltwin: I'm using this page verbatim (http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#serialize) I am not experienced enough to be assuming something needs an extra call or anything?
[10:04:29] <BFranks> So if there should be a init () load.stuff;  .. well I need that.. :(
[10:04:45] <Eviltwin> You need to include jQuery and then after including jQuery, include jQuery UI
[10:04:55] <Eviltwin> And then after both of those, have the relevant script
[10:05:49] <mika2> I have a question -  new to jquery but loving it.  I'm using a Selectable that when click gets data from a php file and shows in a div    initially it worked great but as I added more it now doesn't work on the initial load of the page but if I use one of the other widgets it then starts working?  I"m confused as to why it doesn't work the first time the page is loaded is the .get not loaded the data yet?
[10:05:49] <BFranks> This is my code verbatim http://pastebin.com/8nk0TnpP
[10:06:12] <sphinxxx> Eviltwin, yes a static file .json
[10:06:15] <BFranks> There's no loading errors.. just the missing selectable method error
[10:06:33] <mika2> welllllll BFranks
[10:06:41] <mika2> i added the .error() after the .get
[10:06:58] <mika2> and it does error but I can't get the error  but if I use another widget and then click the SELECTABLE  it starts to work
[10:07:09] <mika2> which makes me believe my php is ok and .get call is ok just a loading order issue
[10:07:35] <BFranks> mika2: But it's so simple? :)
[10:08:26] <mika2> is it?
[10:08:27] <mika2> :-)
[10:08:50] <kyb> hi
[10:09:00] <ohestjohnz> i got a question about checking to see if any children of an element has focus
[10:09:15] <kyb> objContent.children().each(function (i) {
[10:09:15] <kyb>                     if (height + this.clientHeight > options.height) {
[10:09:26] <kyb> this.clientheight works in all browswers
[10:09:30] <kyb> but ie7
[10:09:38] <kyb> what should i do to make it work in ie7
[10:09:52] <kyb> it gets it back as object instead of headerelment
[10:09:57] <kyb> or paragraphelement
[10:10:16] <BFranks> mika2: Well the 2 google lines seemed totally odd.. So I nuked them both and it loads fine.. breakpoints work.. WTF.. why such an ASS example on the main site?
[10:10:18] <kyb> how do i make ie 7 convert it to the proper type
[10:11:06] <mika2> uh?
[10:11:20] <BFranks> "windows update"
[10:11:51] <BFranks> (sorry I never get good answers either unless Thumbs is on.. )
[10:12:08] <kyb> i mean
[10:12:16] <kyb> ie7 doesnt get the clientheight
[10:12:26] <kyb> it doesnt know what this is
[10:13:03] <mika2> ok is there a way to load .get data into a global variable to be used all ova my site??
[10:13:20] <symbolic2> kyb: perhspd yoi
[10:13:29] <skamikaze> ?getJSON @ mika2
[10:13:30] <bot-t> mika2, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:14:09] <symbolic2> kyb: perhaps you need to check browser ver and check for ie7
[10:15:07] <mika2> thanks  dont' know what JSON is but about to learn!!
[10:15:12] <mika2> you guys rock.
[10:15:41] <symbolic2> Json is vital to sny js spp
[10:16:21] <kyb> what
[10:16:32] <kyb> oh
[10:16:47] <kyb> and what do i do after i detect thta its ie7
[10:16:50] <kyb> what do i do
[10:17:51] <symbolic2> You calculation will use a diff property for ie7
[10:18:53] <kyb> which one is that
[10:18:58] <symbolic2> You have to know the equivalent of clientheight in ie7
[10:19:05] <kyb> it comes back as object
[10:19:09] <kyb> well the problem is
[10:19:10] <kyb> this
[10:19:16] <kyb> comes back as object
[10:19:19] <kyb> in ie7
[10:19:30] <kyb> in other browsers its headerelement
[10:19:35] <kyb> or paragraphelement
[10:19:40] <symbolic2> Whats in the object?
[10:19:44] <kyb> idk
[10:19:47] <kyb> how do i find out
[10:20:24] <kyb> http://www.script-tutorials.com/creating-modern-jquery-pagination-for-content/comment-page-1/#comment-16083
[10:20:28] <kyb> basically
[10:20:29] <symbolic2> Console.log it and see. Do you use fire bug?
[10:20:42] <kyb> this pagination doesnt work right in ie7
[10:20:43] <mika2> looked at firebug  installed it
[10:20:47] <mika2> dont' know what's it's telling me
[10:20:49] <mika2> kinda confusing
[10:20:50] <kyb> well im tryin to debug it in ie7
[10:20:53] <kyb> it works in firebug
[10:20:56] <kyb> firefox
[10:21:05] <kyb> im tryin to fix in only for ie7
[10:21:46] <symbolic2> I thought fire bug lite worked in ie7
[10:22:09] <symbolic2> I could be wrong
[10:23:05] <mika2> So what's really annoying to me is that I have to have the same code just witha  different $('#selectable1')   $('#Selectable2')  for each widget  i want to attempt to write a jquery plugin for my selectables so I can use the same one all over my site  any easier way to reuse widgets
[10:23:18] <symbolic> What about ie8 or 9?
[10:23:28] <mantas322> everything works.
[10:23:33] <mantas322> im sorry for yelling at u jquery
[10:25:20] <kyb> it works in ie 8 9
[10:25:24] <kyb> just not 7
[10:25:41] <kyb> my boss says we got to support 7
[10:25:55] <symbolic> Yep. Understand
[10:26:13] <Murof> kyb: say this to your boss "Stop supporting the stone age" even if IE7 is not that old and all
[10:26:25] <muhoo> Murof: that never works
[10:26:28] <mika2> @murof   i agree
[10:26:35] <Murof> muhoo: worked here
[10:26:46] <kyb> cant do that
[10:27:04] <Murof> muhoo: I do write full supported pages, but the full supported here means "visible" not "functional"
[10:27:17] <muhoo> right. derading gracefully is good.
[10:27:21] <muhoo> degrading, sorry
[10:27:32] <drvanon_> Murof: I am sorry I didn't react any more, but had to eat
[10:27:47] <drvanon_> Murof: did you underwhile find the solution?
[10:27:57] <Murof> no prob. So I do give people a chance to see the page, but not 100% working, thats when the pops come and says that the browser and all is outdated and bla bla bla
[10:28:29] <Murof> drvanon: I sent it to ya a couple minutes ago
[10:28:34] <Murof> drvanon: let me find
[10:29:05] <drvanon_> Murof: Thanks
[10:29:16] <drvanon_> Murof: (in advance)
[10:29:59] <BFranks> Anyone spot how I broke ctrl+select support?  http://jsfiddle.net/dF7ck/   ... Only way I can select multiple now is by dragging a box ... need to fix the ctrl+click function
[10:30:05] <symbolic> The equivalent of clientheight in jquery is: $(window).height()
[10:30:33] <Murof> drvanon: I said that I took out some code, and simplified to the point it would work
[10:30:40] <Murof> drvanon: http://jsfiddle.net/9tkYC/16/ start from here and customize
[10:33:53] <Murof> ten ours trololo for you guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkfVdrtLcRs =)
[10:33:57] <Murof> hours*
[10:35:29] <BFranks> Hahaha http://jsfiddle.net/dF7ck/1/ looks identical to http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#serialize and yet the ctrl+click function only works on the demo pages?
[10:36:38] <Murof> BFranks: actually look the source from here --> http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/serialize.html
[10:36:45] <skamikaze> BFranks: add jqueryui resources ..
[10:38:29] <BFranks> skamikaze: How would I add them? jfiddle should be loading them as it's loading jQuery UI 1.8.16 ?
[10:39:02] <BFranks> (My pages are using jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js
[10:39:15] <BFranks> (which is all the elements)
[10:40:46] <drvanon_> Murof: looks pretty niet
[10:41:09] <drvanon_> Murof: result: drvanon.leerik.nl
[10:42:11] <Murof> drvanon: Gratz! the rest now is up to you customizing it ^^
[10:43:02] <dunkel2> is it possible to make a selector that gets all the li of a menu, but one ?
[10:43:53] <Murof> dunkel2: yes it is
[10:44:08] <dunkel2> i have one li with a class
[10:44:21] <dunkel2> and i want to select all the others that doesnt have that class
[10:45:41] <Murof> dunkel2: you should use not
[10:46:23] <blindMoe> will $('#foobar').live('load', function() { $(this).addClass('bar'); }); run on elements loaded via ajax?
[10:46:27] <dunkel2> menu li:not(.myclass)
[10:46:31] <pootietang> hey guys, how can I target a specific jqueryui tab when loading a page?
[10:46:31] <ColKurtz> does typeof on an image object return 'object' ?
[10:46:51] <Murof> dunkey: $('ul > li:not(li[class])').each( ...
[10:47:23] <Murof> dunkey: basically, will get all 'li' elements except those who have 'class' attribute, ust having it empty is enough
[10:47:45] <dunkel2> let me try it thank you :D
[10:47:47] <BFranks> OMFG.. I actually had to REMOVE jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js  ... then I had to download the .js packages from http://jqueryui.com/ui/ ... NOW my pages work like the demos.. ;p
[10:48:00] <Murof> dunkey: no prob, Im the one to thank you if you learn
[10:48:09] <lugzer_> hi
[10:48:17] <Murof> BFranks: gratz!
[10:48:58] <BFranks> Murof: Why would the whole package not work where individual components did? That's not right.. something is broken.
[10:49:25] <pootietang> anyone can give me a tip on how to target a specific tab?
[10:49:35] <lugzer_> does jquery have a functionality built in which allows to make element with fixed position (that works in all browsers)? i just found that there are some plugins for that..
[10:49:48] <Murof> BFranks: because there must be some diffenrece between the distribuition
[10:50:21] <Zzaichik> a specific tab? Does this tab have a unique id or classname?
[10:50:28] <Murof> BFranks: I usually include only what im using, so I include individual components from jqueryUI, thats the why, I open the "stand-alone' window of their show-case
[10:50:39] <pootietang> yes each tab has a unique id
[10:50:49] <Zzaichik> well there you have it. ;)
[10:51:28] <pootietang> I'm new to jquery and I don't know how to pass the call
[10:52:30] <Zzaichik> target the id of the tab.  $('#id-name').click( $(this).hide(); });
[10:52:44] <Zzaichik> I really don't know what you're trying to do
[10:53:19] <Zzaichik> $('#id-name').click(function() { do something });
[10:54:36] <saliak> I'm trying to create a ui widget and I think i'm missing some basic syntax.  I've stripped by issue down to a simple example (http://jsfiddle.net/5ANXT/).  Based on (http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory), there should be a .disabled() method that calls .option('disabled',true).  for some reason this doesn't seem to work.  any ideas?
[10:55:10] <pootietang> I am using 3 jqueryui tabs on a page but depending on where the user comes from, I want to display the content of a specific tab.
[10:56:46] <pachet> does jquery clean up ties to elements replaced with .html()?
[10:57:05] <Zzaichik> pootietang: that's a bit more involved. You are going to have to research jquery a bit.
[10:59:11] <Zzaichik> ?jquery @ pootietang
[10:59:12] <bot-t> pootietang, jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[11:00:08] <pootietang> I'm beginning to get a hold of it
[11:00:12] <pachet> from jquery source: jQuery.cleanData( elem.getElementsByTagName( "*" ) );
[11:00:16] <pootietang> still reading the FM
[11:00:18] <pachet> answering my own question, z
[11:00:33] <ColKurtz> using jquery's on() for binding, if you use it to delegate, $(this) returns the selected element (the container), right?
[11:00:54] <ColKurtz> and the variable passed in the function is the event object
[11:01:04] <ColKurtz> so how do you access the element that was clicked?
[11:02:09] <Jon47> ColKurtz
[11:02:16] <Jon47> you can use the e.target
[11:02:28] <Eviltwin> pachet: I believe .html effectively (or maybe exactly) does .empty().append(...)
[11:02:32] <ColKurtz> oh thanks jon
[11:02:36] <Jon47> it will tell you the deepest element that the event occurred on
[11:03:00] <Jon47> so it won't necessarily be the actual element that you delegated events from
[11:04:48] <ColKurtz> what about e.currentTarget Jon47 ?
[11:04:59] <ColKurtz> is that the container?
[11:05:06] <Jon47> ColKurtz actually i wasn't aware of that one
[11:05:13] <Jon47> it might be exactly what you're looking for
[11:05:21] <ColKurtz> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_currenttarget.asp
[11:05:28] <dnsdds> I'm doing a .show("blind") inside a table cell and the border-bottom lags in place in Chrome at least... any idea?
[11:05:31] <Jon47> aaaa no not w3schools!
[11:05:32] <ColKurtz> "The currentTarget event attribute returns the element whose event listeners triggered the event."
[11:05:52] <ColKurtz> i'm not sureif that means it's the container element
[11:05:59] <Jon47> http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[11:06:14] <ColKurtz> Jon47, can you recommend a better resource documenting native javascript objects?
[11:06:27] <Jon47> MDN is pretty good
[11:06:50] <rogeruiz> ColKurtz: MDN is much better than w3fools
[11:07:12] <rogeruiz> dochub.io scrapes the Mozilla Developer Network
[11:07:24] <rogeruiz> http://dochub.io/ would be a good site to use
[11:07:28] <Jon47> w3schools is mostly not so bad but occasionally it will have bad things(outlined here: w3fools.com)  and the problem is you don't know when it's right or wrong, so it sort of make teh whole thing hard to trust
[11:07:35] <vincent77> buona sera
[11:07:36] <ColKurtz> hum
[11:08:03] <ColKurtz> mdn says it's under repair
[11:08:56] <g0th> join git
[11:09:24] <ColKurtz> dochub looks cool. but when i search for 'event' there are no results
[11:09:25] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:09:25] <Jon47> "doc hub".. or "do chub"
[11:10:12] <Jon47> ColKurtz - search in DOM, not JavaScript
[11:10:46] <ColKurtz> le sigh
[11:10:48] <ColKurtz> didn't notice that
[11:10:49] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:11:00] <Jon47> should be in both, heh
[11:11:04] <blindMoe> is there a way to  have a selector that will select specific elements that have a class but not another class ?
[11:12:08] <chrisinajar> blindMoe: yes, check the selector docuemntation on the jquery site. it's one of the examples.
[11:12:29] <rogeruiz> Jon47: i agree with that
[11:12:29] <blindMoe> hrmm didn't see it on there
[11:12:33] <rogeruiz> it could be in both though
[11:12:38] <blindMoe> I see :not() which I am guessing is what I need
[11:12:46] <rogeruiz> just fork the project on github
[11:13:31] <ColKurtz> actually e.currentTarget is what i was looking for Jon47
[11:13:34] <hlveheart> is there a way to use window.open and specify a window location (like top left, etc.?)
[11:13:37] <chrisinajar> blindMoe: yup
[11:13:41] <ColKurtz> works like a charm
[11:13:59] <ColKurtz> it should be provided as a second variable in the function
[11:14:28] <ColKurtz> $('.container').on('click', 'img', function(event, target){ }
[11:14:30] <ColKurtz> that would be nice.
[11:14:31] <Jon47> ColKurtz - sick, i laerned somethign too ;)
[11:14:38] <chrisinajar> blindMoe: though you generally want to avoid a situation like that by fixing the classes on your dom objects
[11:14:38] <ColKurtz> well
[11:14:43] <ColKurtz> i haven't tested it on other browsers yet
[11:14:44] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:15:01] <ColKurtz> but in firefox it returned the correct element
[11:15:04] <ColKurtz> the img i clicked on
[11:15:09] <Jon47> I've been using $(e.target) and then trying to detect if it's got the class name of the element I delegated events from, and if not, then searching the DOM untilI find it, which is super janky, looking forward to using .currentTarget now
[11:15:32] <blindMoe> chrisinajar: the problem I am having is that specific elements are being loaded by ajax ( for which I cannot have a callback ) that need some jquery ran on them... .live() and .on() are not working with the 'load' event on those elements so I am forced to run a setInterval on it
[11:16:58] <hlveheart> is there a way to use window.open and specify a window location (like top left, etc.?)
[11:18:17] <Murof> hlveheart: I dont remenber...
[11:18:30] <Murof> hlveheart: you can btw do something like mapping what is top-left etc...
[11:18:36] <Murof> hlveheart: and make it by the top and left
[11:19:19] <Murof> like { top-left: moveWindow(0,0)... where movewindow will change the window left:0px and top:0px
[11:19:20] <beardbar|work> Hi jquery champs, I want my section height to be adaptive/responsive to the end users browser windows height. http://jsfiddle.net/AxQev/2/ that way on smaller screens they don't have such a long scroll.  cheers.
[11:20:44] <Murof> beard: look how to get window size, set your sectio height to it
[11:20:48] <troydm> what's the simplest way to delete all elements from div using jquery
[11:20:51] <troydm> ?
[11:20:54] <Murof> beard: just it
[11:21:10] <Zzaichik> troydm: .remove()
[11:21:11] <Murof> troydm: (div > *).remove();
[11:21:29] <Murof> Zzaichik: nice ;)
[11:21:29] <troydm> thx
[11:21:37] <Zzaichik> beardbar|work: nice job on commenting. ;)
[11:22:43] <beardbar|work> Zzaichik: dont give me credit, i found the script online from here http://blog.medianotions.de/en/articles/2009/smoothscroll-for-jquery
[11:23:07] <beardbar|work> murof: duh, basically get hieight and update the section css. forhead slaps
[11:23:25] <Murof> beardbar: simple as that ^^
[11:23:57] <volkman> hello room :)
[11:24:00] <Zzaichik> well then never mind.
[11:24:03] <Zzaichik> hah
[11:24:26] <Murof> volkman: w8 till the room answers you >:)
[11:24:51] <hlveheart> is there any way to specify a window location (like top left, etc...) with window.open?
[11:24:54] <volkman> is it more efficient to traverse the dom within a selector or just to establish a new jquery object?
[11:25:05] <iamcurio> anyone know a good content slider with the same functionality like this: http://www.gucci.com/uk/category/f/women_s_ready_to_wear#look2768lookA113   - the way the inactive products are still visibleâ€¦ full width content slider ?
[11:25:38] <Murof> volkman: be more specific
[11:25:38] <volkman> not sure if that's entirely clear
[11:25:46] <volkman> so
[11:25:51] <Murof> iamcurio: you again man
[11:26:04] <volkman> i have a jquery object $('#somediv')
[11:26:12] <Murof> volkman: hum
[11:26:13] <volkman> i want its parent 3 levels up
[11:26:19] <volkman> which has an id as well
[11:26:20] <iamcurio> Murof: yupâ€¦. it doesn't quite do it the one you showed meâ€¦
[11:26:26] <volkman> is it better to do parent().parent().parent()
[11:26:33] <Murof> volkman: I would be serious about re-thinking my code
[11:26:40] <volkman> ?
[11:27:12] <Murof> volkman: changing the elements order or putting something that can be used to identify like 'rel=...'
[11:27:21] <volkman> this is just an exampleâ€¦ wondering about which is more efficient
[11:27:24] <Zzaichik> iamcurio: they're using jQuery UI, you can probably find a decent plugin - just google it.
[11:27:36] <Zzaichik> Or utilize jQueryUI
[11:27:57] <Murof> volkman: depend on the situation, the crawler will take longer or not, it all depends on your dom structure
[11:28:15] <volkman> k
[11:28:33] <Murof> volkman: if you are 50 levels down and want one parent() its gonna be faster to use .parent() than $(parent-name)
[11:28:40] <iamcurio> Zzaichik: sweet il have a look
[11:28:45] <Murof> volkman: as simples as that
[11:28:51] <Ring0`> Hey. I don't get why it doesn't revalidate after selecting "credit card", I appreciate help! [ http://jsfiddle.net/WFA7S/ ]

[11:29:02] <LukeNukem> hello
[11:29:05] <LukeNukem> i created a function
[11:29:11] <LukeNukem> and then when i call the function later on, it does not work
[11:29:31] <Zzaichik> LukeNukem: need to see it
[11:29:33] <Murof> ring0: nobody here is polak, write it in english :D
[11:29:39] <Zzaichik> ?jsfiddle @ LukeNukem
[11:29:40] <bot-t> LukeNukem, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[11:29:46] <Ring0`> Sorry for the previous link, http://jsfiddle.net/WFA7S/1/
[11:29:46] <Murof> ring0: or whathever language is that
[11:29:51] <Ring0`> This one is updated
[11:30:04] <Murof> ring0: better :D
[11:30:04] <LukeNukem> sorry, this code has php in it too, so cant jsfiddle
[11:30:06] <Ring0`> First time I was using jsfiddle, I thought it get auto updated
[11:30:25] <hlveheart> is there any way to specify a window location (like top left, etc...) with window.open?
[11:30:25] <Murof> ring0: works fine here
[11:30:26] <someprimetime> what's the best selector for targeting everything after a particular br tag?
[11:30:42] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/brSfyYrF
[11:30:44] <aca20031> define 'after'?
[11:30:51] <aca20031> descendants? siblings?
[11:30:54] <Ring0`> Murof: Not until you push confirm, it doesn't require from you to put CC no after selecting CC as method
[11:30:54] <someprimetime> say I have 5 paragraphs separated by <br> tags
[11:30:57] <viewsrc> @h1veheart -- you can move the window after you've created it using the handle window.open returns
[11:31:00] <someprimetime> I want to target everything after the first br tag
[11:31:11] <LukeNukem> i define the function in line 657 and call it in line 728
[11:31:15] <LukeNukem> 718*
[11:31:20] <LukeNukem> Zzaichik,
[11:31:27] <someprimetime> Paragraph one <br> (target everything from here on out) Paragraph 2 <br>
[11:31:29] <hlveheart> viewsrc, explain? o.o
[11:31:45] <LukeNukem> right click >> view source
[11:31:48] <LukeNukem> on your browser
[11:31:56] <CharlieM75> anyone have much experience with jqGrid?
[11:31:58] <Ring0`> Murof: the problem is that it only checkes it `on start` if cc was default method, it WOULD ask you about number and name
[11:32:19] <aca20031> someprimetime i cant think of any selector way atm. id just do a .each on all siblings and if (before br) continue
[11:32:37] <someprimetime> aca20031: word thanks
[11:32:41] <someprimetime> i figured it wouldn't be so cut and dry
[11:33:02] <LukeNukem> umm can someone answer my question
[11:34:00] <viewsrc> @h1veheart: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+%2B+popup+%2B+window+%2B+move&l=1#
[11:34:05] <aca20031> 'it does not work' is a bit vague dont you think LukeNukem?
[11:34:14] <aca20031> try making your first line a console.log('made it!')
[11:34:23] <aca20031> and see if thats printed (ie see if the function is ever called)
[11:34:44] <LukeNukem> sorry im using a plugin and im new to jquery and javascript.
[11:34:49] <LukeNukem> it works when i define the function right before i call it
[11:35:23] <LukeNukem> oh ok nevermind
[11:36:28] <aca20031> oook

Problem is, the ($("p", xhr.responseXML)) part matches the "p" elements of my *current* document, basically moving objects from my document around, instead of matching for the "p" element in my xhr.responseXML.

[12:16:11] <joshualibrarian> Is it a better practice to fetch all the DOM objects that I'm going to use throughout and store them in var's or to run the selectors more often?
[12:17:06] <eddiemonge> store in vars
[12:18:33] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/g2bxh9sbrp9f5pb0qhvayw - I have this, which works, however, I have 10 #splint_storlek - do I make a for loop for that or?
[12:20:58] <DimmuR> I have own filter for datatables with checkbox. I also have "sDom": '<"top"lf<"toolbar">>rt<"bottom"ip>' - what is the best way to put my checkbox with fiter inside .toolbar so it would work? Now i hide my checkbox and move it to toolbar but then .click() doesn't work
[12:21:43] <eddiemonge> nisseni: what do you mean you have 10 #splint_storlek?
[12:22:17] <nisseni> eddiemonge: I have 10 fields with the same id, and then I would probably give each id an unique number
[12:22:41] <eddiemonge> nisseni: you shouldnt. ids are supposed to be uniqe
[12:22:50] <eddiemonge> classes are reusable
[12:23:03] <nisseni> eddiemonge: yeah, of course
[12:23:12] <blindMoe> would $('.test.').live('load', function() { $(this).addClass('bar'); });  be run on items loaded via ajax?
[12:23:27] <nisseni> and the id is already in a foreach loop, so I can give them all a unique id
[12:23:28] <blindMoe> it doesn't seem to be working and I am not sure that it is my fault
[12:25:11] <nisseni> eddiemonge: var splint_storlek = $('#splint_storlek'); - should I put that within a for loop and set an increasable variable for each new var?
[12:25:36] <Turncoat> if you are wanting to mess with a group of items, give them all a class and not an id
[12:25:44] <Turncoat> as eddiemonge stated.
[12:27:58] <jeffreylevesque> how do you test if an element is display:block

[12:34:09] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to use :not but instead of using it in conjunction with a selector, use it with an instance of an element
[12:34:24] <ProLoser|Work> like $('.tooltip:not('$someEl')')
[12:34:26] <ProLoser|Work> or something
[12:35:05] <joshualibrarian> What's the syntax to dynamically remove a CSS tag entirely, such as this one:
[12:35:05] <joshualibrarian> #nav_control a:hover { background-position: 0 108px; } ?  Is there a nice clean way to disable/re-enable  this bit of CSS entirely?
[12:35:33] <aaronmcadam> ProLoser|Work: like $someEl[0].id?
[12:35:46] <eddiemonge> ?not @ ProLoser|Work

[12:37:28] <ProLoser|Work> i was thinking about filter
[12:37:35] <ProLoser|Work> but will it match elements?

[12:37:59] <jeffreylevesque> how do you check if an element is has .hide() applied to it?
[12:38:04] <aaronmcadam> if jsfiddle would bloody log me in I would have showed u already
[12:38:04] <aaronmcadam> lol
[12:38:20] <aaronmcadam> jeffreylevesque: it would have olddisplay data prop[
[12:38:21] <aaronmcadam> jeffreylevesque: it would have olddisplay data prop
[12:38:28] <nisseni> eddiemonge: thanks, but there's something else I'm missing... not working
[12:38:42] <thang> jeffreylevesque: $(element).is(":visible")
[12:38:45] <aaronmcadam> or, jeffreylevesque, is(':hidden')
[12:38:49] <jeffreylevesque> i dont' know what that means lol but i've tried f ( $('#foo').is(':visible') ) {
[12:38:56] <hlveheart> is there any way to specify a window location (like top left, etc...) with window.open?
[12:39:12] <aaronmcadam> how would it be visible if it was hidden?
[12:39:14] <aaronmcadam> exactly?
[12:39:27] <jeffreylevesque> it's a click() event
[12:39:37] <aaronmcadam> you want hidden, not visible
[12:39:38] <jeffreylevesque> each time an elemnt is clicked
[12:39:43] <jeffreylevesque> another element slideToggles
[12:40:02] <aaronmcadam> lovely nginx error on jsfiddle :)
[12:40:03] <jeffreylevesque> i want to know when an item is toggled into visibility or hiden
[12:41:10] <jeffreylevesque> is(':hidden') is saying the item is always hidden
[12:41:19] <blindMoe> aaronmcadam: yeah jsfiddle is really laggy right now for me
[12:41:19] <aaronmcadam> why don't u just use the callbacks?
[12:41:25] <jeffreylevesque> but it's visible lol
[12:41:27] <aaronmcadam> you'll know whether it's hidden or not there
[12:41:33] <aaronmcadam> got 502 dude
[12:42:17] <aaronmcadam> well, u wouldn't even have to check its visibility
[12:42:25] <aaronmcadam> you'd know by which callback it is
[12:42:35] <jeffreylevesque> then i'd need two events
[12:42:41] <aaronmcadam> what?
[12:42:41] <jeffreylevesque> one callback to hide
[12:42:43] <jeffreylevesque> one to show
[12:42:46] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[12:42:51] <aaronmcadam> toggle does that for u
[12:42:58] <jeffreylevesque> yeah
[12:43:04] <aaronmcadam> ?toggle
[12:43:05] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[12:43:17] <aaronmcadam> but, it also takes a callback
[12:43:22] <aaronmcadam> u with me yet?
[12:43:41] <jeffreylevesque> im using slideToggle('slow') lol
[12:43:47] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/ how can i hide everything after the first 2 <br>'s?
[12:44:33] <aaronmcadam> what are u actually trying to do jeffrey
[12:45:01] <aaronmcadam> in your callback for slideToggle, you will know that it is visible
[12:45:02] <jeffreylevesque> toggling a <ul> to visiblity
[12:45:25] <aaronmcadam> because it will call once the slide down is complete
[12:45:30] <jeffreylevesque> than hide it
[12:45:35] <aaronmcadam> do u know what I mean
[12:45:40] <aaronmcadam> by callback?
[12:46:01] <jeffreylevesque> it's hidden by default in jQuery
[12:46:23] <jeffreylevesque> than slideToggle('slow') makes it visible and hides it
[12:46:37] <Eviltwin> jeffreylevesque: Use .toggle(fn, fn)
[12:46:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah so?
[12:47:01] <aaronmcadam> what are u trying to do??
[12:47:20] <aaronmcadam> do u just want to slide it down or something?
[12:47:23] <jeffreylevesque> i need to know when my item is visible
[12:47:31] <jeffreylevesque> so i can add some css when it's visible
[12:47:31] <aaronmcadam> k one min
[12:47:40] <jeffreylevesque> when it's not displayed everything is fine
[12:47:41] <aaronmcadam> you should add a class
[12:47:51] <aaronmcadam> one minute
[12:47:53] <jeffreylevesque> when it toggles into visibility it adds padding
[12:48:33] <jeffreylevesque> ok i'll just addClass()
[12:48:39] <jeffreylevesque> if it hasClass(), then remove it
[12:48:53] <jeffreylevesque> if it hasClass then my css wil do it's thang
[12:48:55] <jeffreylevesque> lol
[12:48:57] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[12:49:15] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/mqgirllqyaggkk6qehqtq - the first field works fine - the second does not, what's wroing?
[12:49:40] <polorix> Hey guys. I figure this is simple but I have no idea how to do it. Using this updated script, how would I make the rolled over image revert back to the original on mouseout? http://www.selfcontained.us/2008/03/08/simple-jquery-image-rollover-script/
[12:49:59] <aaronmcadam> jeffreylevesque: why don't u just add the class to the html?
[12:50:08] <aaronmcadam> why do u need to know if it is visible?
[12:51:09] <nisseni> anyone?
[12:52:23] <jeffreylevesque> because when visible it adds extra space to the top
[12:52:31] <jeffreylevesque> but i figured out how to fix it
[12:52:37] <jeffreylevesque> im just going to add class
[12:52:38] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[12:52:46] <jeffreylevesque> addClass()
[12:52:49] <maxaud> I'd like to animate something like .slideToggle() but I want the top 100px to stay visible when it's toggled to hidden.. how would I do this?
[12:52:53] <aaronmcadam> the callback only runs once the animation is complete
[12:53:00] <aaronmcadam> you'd need a beforeStart cbacvk
[12:53:14] <aaronmcadam> s/v/
[12:53:42] <Murof> nisseni: nothing aparently wrong, normally if just the first one succeed its cause after the first conditional, JS found one error, and stoped
[12:53:56] <aaronmcadam> maxaud: damn u don't ask for much do ya :p
[12:54:13] <aaronmcadam> maxaud: you're gonna have to use 2 divs
[12:54:29] <maxaud> aaronmcadam: dang, I was hoping to avoid that.
[12:54:36] <aaronmcadam> not without fuckin around with overflows
[12:54:59] <nisseni> Murof: true, but I can't see any errors :(
[12:55:09] <maxaud> aaronmcadam: can't I animate to certain heights? though the dividers will be a dynamic height.
[12:55:19] <aaronmcadam> animate to a height?
[12:55:34] <aaronmcadam> that's fun let me see
[12:57:07] <polorix> Anyone? I know there is supposed to be an after effect for the hover state, don't know if that is old jquery or not
[12:57:55] <juha____> polorix: mouseout?
[12:57:57] <aaronmcadam> ok
[12:58:06] <aaronmcadam> maxaud: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/LqptY/
[12:58:20] <polorix> juha____: well yeah, but it uses .hover
[12:58:46] <aaronmcadam> right so you could toggle this
[12:59:12] <juha____> polorix: $(selector).mousein().mouseout();
[12:59:27] <polorix> juha____: did you take a look at that link i posted?
[12:59:38] <maxaud> aaronmcadam: I'll have to mess around with it so I can use dynamic hieghts.
[12:59:38] <aaronmcadam> yeah maxaud i reckon u could do it that way
[12:59:39] <juha____> polorix: nope, just joined this channel
[12:59:47] <aaronmcadam> oh i just set that
[12:59:47] <maxaud> aaronmcadam: thanks
[12:59:48] <Murof> nisseni: just put this fragment of code into jsfiddle and we can see it working
[12:59:49] <aaronmcadam> it should work
[12:59:57] <polorix> juha____: oh ok, http://www.selfcontained.us/2008/03/08/simple-jquery-image-rollover-script/
[13:00:00] <juha____> polorix: only thing that comes to my mind about "hover after effect" i mouseout
[13:00:01] <nisseni> Murof: will do
[13:00:11] <aaronmcadam> i just set it so I had some numbers to play with maxaud, it should work fine if u do $(el).height()
[13:00:35] <aaronmcadam> be careful about including padding,margin etc in ur offsets tho
[13:00:38] <maxaud> aaronmcadam:  hmm, ok.
[13:00:54] <juha____> polorix: shouldn't mouseout work just fine with hover? if not, try changing hover to mousein and add mouseout
[13:00:54] <tom[]> a datepicker inside a jui dialog is displaying as soon as the dialog opens. why is that? and how to prevent?
[13:00:59] <aaronmcadam> I've come up against it before
[13:01:03] <aaronmcadam> ?outerHeight
[13:01:04] <bot-t> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[13:01:16] <aaronmcadam> think that's the one I used
[13:01:30] <juha____> polorix: oh, also, there is two function calls on that example, first one is mousein, second is mouseout
[13:01:57] <juha____> polorix: $(selector).hover(function() {my_mousein();}, function() { my_mouseout(); });
[13:02:09] <aaronmcadam> no need to do that
[13:02:27] <aaronmcadam> $(selector).hover( my_mousein, my_mouseout );
[13:02:34] <polorix> juha____: ah ok, does that example do that? http://www.selfcontained.us/2008/03/08/simple-jquery-image-rollover-script/
[13:02:37] <aaronmcadam> no need for the anon func just to call a func juha____
[13:03:02] <polorix> aaronmcadam: or i guess you could take a look
[13:03:09] <aaronmcadam> why are u using js for a rollover?
[13:03:12] <juha____> aaronmcadam: true, i placed them there as an example
[13:03:18] <polorix> in the comments someone stated they wanted to know how to go back to the original image on mouse out
[13:03:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah just style stuffs :)
[13:03:35] <polorix> aaronmcadam: images will be loaded dynamically
[13:03:41] <aaronmcadam> right
[13:03:47] <aaronmcadam> ok dammit, no sprites :D
[13:04:02] <polorix> :P
[13:04:08] <aaronmcadam> yeah so a simple hover with 2 callbacks will do
[13:04:31] <aaronmcadam> but you'd need to store the ext reference to the hoveredIm
[13:04:33] <aaronmcadam> img
[13:04:36] <polorix> aaronmcadam: Thats what i'm assuming, but i wanted to use that already written script, but i don't know a thing about jquery :P
[13:04:44] <aaronmcadam> great
[13:04:47] <juha____> bot-t: tell coldhead i need him
[13:04:47] <bot-t> juha____, Okay.
[13:04:52] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ polorix
[13:04:54] <bot-t> polorix, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[13:05:04] <polorix> Thank you
[13:05:05] <nisseni> Murof: same thing in jsfiddle... where do I go from here?
[13:05:22] <aaronmcadam> polorix: you've used js before right?
[13:06:01] <polorix> aaronmcadam: nope, just know enough to be dangerous so to say, i can edit and modify small things, but can't write from scratch
[13:06:09] <aaronmcadam> I've done stuff like this before it's very easy
[13:06:24] <aaronmcadam> hover, change img, revert to old img
[13:06:29] <aaronmcadam> on mouseout
[13:06:47] <aaronmcadam> eine momento
[13:07:07] <polorix> aaronmcadam: oh, i believe you, i just can't actually write it, i understand the logic and how it's done, just not the syntax, i guess i was asking for a handout, my apologies :P
[13:07:17] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[13:09:20] <moesti> hi, i load a website with ajax and want to hide a selector if the document is loaded
[13:09:25] <moesti> $(document).on('load', '#create-content', function(){
[13:09:27] <moesti>         $('#create-content').hide();
[13:09:29] <moesti>     });
[13:09:36] <moesti> i donÂ´t know the right event
[13:09:54] <sphinxxx> moesti, on window load?
[13:09:58] <NoiseEee> load a website with ajax?
[13:09:59] <moesti> yes
[13:10:05] <NoiseEee> surely not a website.  not <html> tags and all.
[13:10:05] <sphinxxx> you can use window load or dom ready
[13:10:22] <moesti> not a website only a div
[13:10:25] <NoiseEee> moesti: anyways... that would go in your callback.
[13:10:33] <sphinxxx> if using an ajax request, you do it on a the success callback
[13:10:44] <sphinxxx> i'm not familiar with using .on  in that way though
[13:11:26] <moesti>   $(document).on('click', '#create-page', function(){
[13:11:28] <moesti>         $('#create-content').toggle("fast");
[13:11:30] <moesti>     });
[13:11:32] <moesti> this works
[13:11:52] <moesti> i thought its possible to change the event
[13:12:23] <NoiseEee> moesti: again, the "hide my selector" part comes in your success callback function itself, the one that is updating your <div> with new content
[13:12:52] <moesti> can u show me an example with callback?
[13:13:02] <polorix> aaronmcadam: I appreciate it
[13:14:01] <NoiseEee> moesti: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:14:09] <moesti> ty
[13:15:01] <moesti> oh ok i think u mean on complete
[13:15:15] <aaronmcadam> polorix: done
[13:15:24] <aaronmcadam> polorix: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/LqptY/
[13:15:31] <polorix> aaronmcadam: :| already?
[13:15:37] <aaronmcadam> yerp
[13:15:45] <Eviltwin> moesti: Please don't post more than one or two lines directly to chat
[13:15:50] <Eviltwin> moesti: Use pastebin for longer posts
[13:16:05] <moesti> oh ok
[13:16:07] <moesti> sry
[13:17:04] <Eviltwin> More than one or two lines of code
[13:17:06] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/ any way to hide everything after the first 2 <br>'s?
[13:17:07] <Eviltwin> Chat is obviously fine
[13:17:25] <someprimetime> was thinking of possibly wrapping the rest of it in a div that's hidden
[13:17:37] <polorix> aaronmcadam: oh shoot, that's just one image specified in the jscript? I pretty much just want all <img>'s in #right to rollover to their image name but with _c.jpg after.
[13:17:49] <aaronmcadam> that was just an example
[13:17:56] <polorix> aaronmcadam: but that made me understand something else much better :)
[13:17:59] <aaronmcadam> it's up to u how u wanna specify the sources
[13:18:23] <aaronmcadam> I don't know what ur usecase is remember i can't see ur app, nor do i want to
[13:18:28] <Murof> nisseni: sry for the wait, even if its the same thing, pass me link, so I can see the stuff
[13:18:32] <polorix> thats why i wanted to know how to modify that existing script to just go back to it's src image on mouse out or at the end of .hover
[13:18:42] <aaronmcadam> i'm sure you can figure out a way to pull the sources from the list of img
[13:18:48] <nisseni> Murof: yeah, I have to make a user in order to save it, right?
[13:19:09] <Murof> yes
[13:19:18] <aaronmcadam> polorix: the new Image() stuff is just preloading the img so u don't see a flash while it loads on hover for the first time
[13:19:35] <Murof> just click save
[13:19:39] <Murof> and copy the url to me
[13:20:03] <Murof> just ignore the part about a user... :)
[13:20:18] <Murof> http://jsfiddle.net/funny_code_here/ <-- will look like this
[13:21:22] <juha____> has anyone else experienced any weird loading issues with amazon s3? it seems that sometimes it's not loading my images or javascript and is blocking other content from loading, which is a pain.
[13:21:49] <nisseni> Murof: haha, "or use the save button", sometimes I'm blind... http://jsfiddle.net/SKpKP/
[13:22:09] <nisseni> Murof: first one working, not the second
[13:22:48] <Murof> nisseni: ok gotta look
[13:22:59] <nisseni> Murof: thanks
[13:24:08] <Murof> nisseni: give me a test case, pair of values to test
[13:24:15] <aaronmcadam> weird juha____ rackspace's cdn is awesome, dunno :)
[13:24:26] <nisseni> Murof: just try a number over 3200
[13:25:02] <nisseni> Murof: it should add html if the value in "Storlek" is over 3200
[13:25:24] <Murof> nisseni: there are no 10 elements, hes gonna throw error after first time...
[13:25:45] <Murof> nisseni: let me see what else
[13:26:05] <nisseni> Murof: ok, well, in the real case there's a for loop that makes 10 elements
[13:26:40] <Murof> ah ok
[13:26:56] <moesti> how can i set an autocomplete on ajax loaded content?
[13:26:57] <moesti> $("#search").autocomplete({"source":["test1", "test2", "test3"]});
[13:27:07] <moesti> after callback donÂ´t work
[13:27:18] <nisseni> Murof: setting the for to limit at 2 still doesn't work
[13:27:42] <Murof> nisseni: my update -> http://jsfiddle.net/SKpKP/1/
[13:27:59] <Murof> gonna try 2 now
[13:28:48] <nisseni> Murof: thatone doesn't work...
[13:29:26] <Murof> I just removed the loop and changed the way the red message was appering
[13:29:33] <Murof> correcting the loop now =_=
[13:29:49] <Murof> when ur using jquery u use the childs property, not loop throw 1...10
[13:29:59] <Murof> but lets maintain that for now
[13:30:04] <endberg> hi everyone
[13:30:22] <Murof> well ur giving a return, how can we finish the for ?
[13:30:37] <nisseni> return false?
[13:30:38] <Murof> done
[13:30:45] <Murof> return abort the operation
[13:30:55] <Murof> look -> http://jsfiddle.net/SKpKP/2/
[13:31:20] <tom[]> when a jui dialog closes, how does it make sure jui widgets "inside" it (e.g. a datepicker on a form input) also close?
[13:31:25] <Murof> nisseni: the "return" behavior is not jquery related by, logical related...you should study some more algoritms
[13:31:50] <Murof> you could improve yuor code with jquery by changing it to
[13:32:01] <tom[]> does jui send an event to the widgets inside?
[13:32:02] <jaequery> hi, got a simple question, i have a date string like, 2011-03-23 00:00:00,   how can i convert that into 03/23/11 ?
[13:32:10] <endberg> Id like to know, is this line correct? $('div.cItem:eq(itemcounter)').toggleClass('selected');
[13:32:30] <Murof> $('input .rackeresult').each(function(){ ... treat it here
[13:32:31] <nisseni> Murof: ah, works like a charm doing like that
[13:32:54] <nisseni> Murof: how do I get the i value?
[13:33:04] <nisseni> Murof: I guess that's instead of the for loop?
[13:33:16] <Murof> the each property gives you the index, but you wouldnt need it
[13:33:28] <Murof> code...).each(function(index){ ... code
[13:37:34] <nanni> ciao
[13:37:37] <nanni> !list
[13:38:10] <someprimetime> is it possible to hide everything after the first two <br>'s here: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/ ?
[13:38:41] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Not simply/directly
[13:39:00] <Eviltwin> Most jQuery methods act on elements which does not include text
[13:39:14] <juha____> aaronmcadam: robert scoble could be good enough reason to move over :P
[13:39:21] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, i was just trying to find something that targets just text after a <br>
[13:39:39] <Eviltwin> And jQuery's not really designed for that
[13:39:41] <someprimetime> this is due to using nl2br built in to pylons, so i think I'll write an nl2p helper instead
[13:39:55] <someprimetime> so i can target the p's instead of br's
[13:40:42] <aaronmcadam> juha____: what ya mean?
[13:41:14] <aaronmcadam> has anybody gotten rack connect to work?
[13:41:36] <juha____> aaronmcadam: he does awesome podcasts/blog articles, he's also working at rackspace
[13:41:40] <aaronmcadam> we're trying to spin up cloud servers, they're still trying to work it out themselves between teams
[13:41:53] <aaronmcadam> I know the name, didn;'t know he was at rs
[13:42:22] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: It's kind of messy but you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/n4jnr/1/
[13:42:37] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you think i could just do a count of all the text and grab the length and anything after X amount of characters, hide that?
[13:42:42] <Eviltwin> But yeah, <p>'s would be more ideal
[13:43:32] <Eviltwin> I don't recommend by doing it as character offsets in HTML
[13:44:28] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: right. good point. and you may think that solution is messy, but i think it works and it's exactly what i need to do
[13:44:36] <someprimetime> thanks
[13:45:23] <moesti> http://dpaste.de/7JV06/
[13:45:39] <moesti> can someone tell me why it is sometimes still indicates whether i hide it?
[13:45:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Just read through it and understand how it works before blindly plugging it in
[13:45:45] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: absolutely.
[13:45:46] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: api.jquery.com is your friend
[13:45:53] <someprimetime> yeah there is a bunch of new stuff here
[13:46:03] <someprimetime> i love your solutions though. they actually help me learn new stuff
[13:46:32] <Eviltwin> Also a lot of people don't realize, but this documents everything the $(...) can do: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:46:47] <maxaud> aaronmcadam: so .height() in my case is being run on a table and it's only returning the height of the thead, not the whole table. Know how I can get the height of the whole table that's using display:table ?
[13:46:57] <chovy> moesti: what do you mean?
[13:47:18] <endberg> Please help: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/  I'd like to make this selection, but its not working: $('div.cItem:eq(itemcounter)').toggleClass('selected');
[13:47:28] <moesti> i mean i hide the element on the callback, but sometmes it shows up
[13:47:39] <Eviltwin> Oh, and there should have been a comma in there instead of a semicolon but it didn't make a difference in this case: http://jsfiddle.net/n4jnr/1/
[13:47:49] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: i've never seen $('<div>', {id: "hide_me"})â€¦ is that preferred over the wrap() method?
[13:47:53] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/n4jnr/2/ *
[13:48:10] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: It's another way of writing $("<div id='hide_me'>") that I find more readable
[13:48:20] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah that's cool. pretty clean
[13:48:23] <moesti> http://dpaste.de/7JV06/
[13:48:48] <Eviltwin> endberg: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/
[13:49:12] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do, .wrap isn't exactly what you're looking for
[13:49:22] <Eviltwin> If you do $("p").wrap("<div>")
[13:49:32] <Eviltwin> That wraps each P tag in its own DIV
[13:49:33] <moesti> i seems the requerst doesnÂ´t finish so that there is no selector to hide
[13:49:36] <endberg> thank you very much!
[13:49:53] <Eviltwin> moesti: Sounds like a problem with your server
[13:50:02] <someprimetime> ah, right. no this is exactly fine.. i was intending to wrap all of the elements after the 2nd br in that hidden container, which this does.

[13:57:43] <andrew9183> wow masonry is awesomeness
[13:58:43] <joshualibrarian> What selector can I access a ":hover" CSS entry with?
[13:58:56] <Eviltwin> ?
[13:59:09] <Renegade001> Has anyone any idea on how I could calculate acceleration via holding down an arrow key to control a character?
[13:59:13] <Eviltwin> "access a ":hover" CSS entry"?
[13:59:42] <Phrogz> Renegade001: wut?
[13:59:49] <joshualibrarian> Eviltwin:  in CSS the hover is set with "#nav_control a:hover {background-position: 108px}
[14:00:12] <Phrogz> Renegade001: If it's linear acceleration, add a constant amount to a velocity each constant time period while the key is down?
[14:00:25] <Renegade001> The longer you hold it down, the further it accelerates but with keydown, it fires every ~500ms and I can't maintain Date.time()
[14:00:29] <joshualibrarian> I want to be able to change that background position when it's hovering (temporarily).
[14:00:45] <Renegade001> Phrogz: That's what I want to do but, keydown fires seperate events
[14:00:47] <joshualibrarian> btnRight.hover().css('background-position', '0 0'); doesn't do it.
[14:01:10] <Renegade001> Am I going to have to track time between each event and check to see if a new acceleration has started?
[14:01:27] <Renegade001> That was a terrible explanation but I hope you might get the jist
[14:02:43] <Phrogz> Renegade001: use keyup to detect when it was released?
[14:02:58] <joshualibrarian> I can access the REGULAR (not hovering) background-position easily! with btnRight.css('background-position, '0 0')
[14:03:09] <Renegade001> Phrogz: Oh how did I not realise that >.<
[14:03:16] <Renegade001> Phrogz: Thank you!
[14:03:20] <Phrogz> You're welcome :)

[14:15:42] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: any idea why my alert isn't triggering? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/4/
[14:16:30] <someprimetime> i'm using replaceWith, which is why I am putting delegate on that target selector
[14:16:53] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You're using .delegate wrong
[14:16:57] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: see ?.delegate
[14:16:58] <bot-t> someprimetime, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[14:18:52] <trevor_> no
[14:18:56] <trevor_> position: fixed
[14:19:51] <trevor_> and zIndex: 9999 or some number higher than all viewable elements
[14:20:02] <trevor_> or z-index in css
[14:21:02] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/29/
[14:21:38] <joshualibrarian> So, even though I'm removing the HREF attribute, and the "link hand" disappears, if you click right or left WHILE it's moving, it gets... OFF KILTER!
[14:21:41] <joshualibrarian> Any ideas?
[14:21:54] <joshualibrarian> like, hit left and while it's moving hit left again.
[14:23:26] <joshualibrarian> the removal of href seems to work to prevent you from getting outside the bounds, but it's not working during the animation!
[14:28:10] <Zzaichik> .stop(true, true)  right before the .animate({})  probably
[14:30:37] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks. http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/6/ almost got it
[14:30:54] <someprimetime> am i using undelegate properly?
[14:31:08] <someprimetime> as of now, if you click to show more then click to see less, it only works once
[14:31:18] <someprimetime> i figure the click event needs to be unbound, right?
[14:31:31] <aaronmcadam> why does it need to unbound dude?
[14:34:40] <endberg> bye and thanks again
[14:35:58] <someprimetime> aaronmcadam: you're right. i don't think it does
[14:36:06] <joshualibrarian> BOTH links should be disabling BEFORE the animation, so why the hell does a click on them still have an effect?!  http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/29/
[14:36:06] <someprimetime> but i'm trying to find out why each event won't trigger more than once
[14:36:11] <someprimetime> do I need to stop propagation?
[14:36:31] <aaronmcadam> u must be delegating wrong
[14:37:02] <djQuery> someprimetime: think you could keep the click on there without undelgating it.
[14:37:05] <joshualibrarian> is there like a mouse-click queue or something I can disable?!
[14:38:34] <aaronmcadam> why do u need to disable them?
[14:38:53] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: .stop()
[14:39:06] <aaronmcadam> u want the animation to stop before the next click
[14:39:18] <someprimetime> no, but it just won't work after the first click on each of them
[14:39:26] <someprimetime> like try to click show more/less a bunch of times
[14:39:52] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik: I don't want to stop the animation, just let each one finish before the user can start anther one.
[14:40:31] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/29/ click on the next or prev buttons and then click on them again while the animation is going, you'll see my problem.  They're supposed to line up neatly each time.
[14:40:39] <djQuery> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/n4jnr/7/
[14:40:42] <aaronmcadam> wow dude
[14:40:47] <dethkrieg> so Jquery had a validator. In this validator you can setup rules, using a rules object. is there anyway to access this object, if so, how? (http://pastebin.com/fhv1SFPV)
[14:40:51] <someprimetime> ah preventDefault(0
[14:40:53] <someprimetime> woops
[14:40:57] <someprimetime> preventDefault(), rather
[14:41:01] <someprimetime> had a feeling i should be doing that
[14:41:05] <someprimetime> thanks djQuery
[14:41:08] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:41:26] <djQuery> someprimetime: notice that I got rid of the some of the ids
[14:41:32] <someprimetime> i used stopPropagation() but that obviously didn't do it
[14:41:37] <someprimetime> yeah, a little leanrt
[14:41:42] <someprimetime> leaner gah can't type today
[14:42:04] <someprimetime> i was planning on using toggle() eventually, but just wanted to get it working first :P
[14:42:09] <someprimetime> thanks man i appreciate the help
[14:42:11] <aaronmcadam> dethkrieg: $('form').rules()
[14:42:15] <aaronmcadam> try reading the docs first
[14:42:18] <aaronmcadam> :)
[14:42:44] <joshualibrarian> oooh, clearQueue!
[14:42:53] <aaronmcadam> dethkrieg: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules
[14:43:37] <djQuery> hmmmm the toggle class doesnt seem to be working there
[14:44:04] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: .clearQueue() is about the same as .stop(true)
[14:44:05] <dethkrieg> thanks aaronmcadam
[14:44:08] <aaronmcadam> np
[14:44:11] <Zzaichik> so yeah, either way should work
[14:44:33] <someprimetime> djQuery: that intended for me?
[14:44:37] <someprimetime> if so i'm working on it atm
[14:44:48] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: I would still recommend using .stop(true)
[14:44:56] <djQuery> what that the toggleClass doesnt seem to be working yes
[14:44:59] <djQuery> kinda
[14:45:14] <someprimetime> the toggle class works fine
[14:45:19] <someprimetime> but you got rid of $less, which contained the text
[14:45:29] <someprimetime> i'll just do some logic with the text
[14:45:48] <someprimetime> $(this).text() == 'Show More' ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More';
[14:45:49] <someprimetime> or something
[14:46:00] <aaronmcadam> use ===
[14:46:04] <djQuery> someprimetime: yes I was gonna to a has class at the end to see what to set the text to
[14:46:14] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  Still isn't working, am I putting it in the the wrong place?
[14:46:24] <Eviltwin> Use ====
[14:46:28] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:46:34] <aaronmcadam> ~=
[14:46:35] <joshualibrarian> I should have it not before but right after the animate call?
[14:46:38] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: it needs to go right before the .animate for both the left and right click events.
[14:46:46] <Zzaichik> no, right before
[14:47:26] <joshualibrarian> that's where I put it, and still the same behavior
[14:47:53] <Zzaichik> hmmm
[14:48:08] <Zzaichik> give me the jsfiddle link again
[14:48:12] <Zzaichik> updated
[14:48:12] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/29/
[14:48:49] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  you see I commented out my other failed solution and added the stops...
[14:49:19] <someprimetime> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/8/
[14:49:21] <someprimetime> done
[14:49:24] <someprimetime> :) thanks
[14:49:42] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: soo close.
[14:50:03] <Zzaichik> navList.stop(true).animate({})
[14:50:03] <djQuery> someprimetime: coool
[14:50:36] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian:  OR navList.stop(true, true).animate({})
[14:52:18] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  ahh... trying...
[14:53:44] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  Oohho!  it works with stop(true, true) but not stop(true).  :)
[14:54:06] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  Thank you!  still haven't gotten the hang of this daisy chaining functions thing.
[14:54:25] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: Awesome!  Yeah stop(true, true) clears the queue as it should.  My pleasure. good luck
[14:54:41] <Zzaichik> or prevents a queue rather
[14:54:42] <aaronmcadam> ?stop
[14:54:42] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:55:28] <joshualibrarian>  I'm still stuck on how to access the :hover properties of the left/right buttons to turn the hovers off when they are otherwise disabled!
[14:55:38] <joshualibrarian> same fiddle...http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/33/
[14:56:10] <aaronmcadam> you'll have to suppress the hover
[14:56:21] <aaronmcadam> just cuz you've removed the href doesn't remove the hover event u kno
[14:56:30] <Zzaichik> I'd do it with classes and have the styles be in the CSS
[14:56:42] <aaronmcadam> cursor : default
[14:56:49] <Zzaichik> yep
[14:56:59] <Zzaichik> and whatever colors
[14:57:26] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam:  I know it doesn't remove the event, but how do I supress it?
[14:59:01] <aaronmcadam> never tried to preventDefault on a hover
[14:59:16] <aaronmcadam> doesn't make sense really
[14:59:22] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian:   Surpress  it? Elaborate.
[14:59:28] <aaronmcadam> you'd have to add a class
[14:59:29] <djQuery> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/n4jnr/11/
[14:59:38] <aaronmcadam> and then say .class:hover { cursor : default }
[14:59:41] <aaronmcadam> in ur css
[14:59:48] <chee> coldhead: what
[15:00:48] <someprimetime> djQuery: what'd you change?
[15:01:22] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam:  I'm confused... already in the css: #nav_control a:hover {		
[15:01:22] <joshualibrarian> 	background-position: 0 108px;
[15:01:22] <joshualibrarian> }
[15:01:36] <aaronmcadam> there's no cursor property there dude
[15:01:49] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam:  but at the same time as I disable the href, to turn the link off, I also want to turn off the rollover.
[15:02:00] <aaronmcadam> yeah use a class man
[15:02:08] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem
[15:02:35] <aaronmcadam> ?addClass @ joshualibrarian
[15:02:36] <bot-t> joshualibrarian, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[15:02:42] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam:  so add a class to the a?  sorry, I'm a noob and don't quite get it.
[15:02:48] <Zzaichik> .addClass('no-hover-state');  CSS ->  .no-hover-state{ whatever }
[15:02:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah I got that lol
[15:03:09] <aaronmcadam> also, you shouldn't be using #
[15:03:19] <aaronmcadam> as the href but maybe that's confusing u more lol
[15:03:42] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam: should I use '_blank' ?
[15:03:50] <aaronmcadam> javascript:void(0)
[15:03:56] * joshualibrarian frowns.
[15:04:01] <Zzaichik> haha
[15:04:05] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:04:08] <Zzaichik> duuude
[15:04:17] <aaronmcadam> brainfuck lol
[15:04:46] <djQuery> someprimetime: count how many times you were doing $(this)
[15:05:02] <djQuery> kinda nitpiky but they add up after a while
[15:05:27] <aaronmcadam> are you an actual librarian? :D
[15:06:27] <joshualibrarian> aaronmcadam: informally.
[15:06:30] <Compeeler> sup
[15:06:34] <aaronmcadam> that's so cool :D
[15:06:54] <Compeeler> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9011726/jquery-simple-collision-error    can anyone answer me jquery question
[15:07:09] <aaronmcadam> simple collision?
[15:07:14] <Compeeler> yes
[15:07:22] <aaronmcadam> ?
[15:07:33] <Zzaichik> alright so here's what you want to do; go to the programming section and get the book for JavaScriptâ€¦     just kidding.
[15:07:35] <Compeeler> the question is in the link dude
[15:07:41] <aaronmcadam> jesus no
[15:07:48] <aaronmcadam> libraries have js books from 97
[15:07:53] <aaronmcadam> that'd do more harm than good lol
[15:08:14] <aaronmcadam> maybe try to learn programming first really heh
[15:08:28] <Compeeler> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9011726/jquery-simple-collision-error  i dont know if anyone here could answer
[15:09:09] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:09:12] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:09:20] <aaronmcadam> collision detection u meant
[15:09:24] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: In the area you want to suppress the hover,  add in .addClass('disabled-link') then in your CSS, target that classname and have it do whatever you want style-wise. Which I'm guessing is cursor: default;
[15:09:28] <Compeeler> yeah
[15:09:53] <aaronmcadam> dude
[15:09:56] <aaronmcadam> make it a jsfiddle
[15:09:59] <Zzaichik> hmmm, maybe toggleClass()
[15:10:02] <aaronmcadam> add it to ur SO post
[15:10:07] <djQuery> Compeeler: ?DEMO

[15:10:22] <aaronmcadam> just the same kyb

[15:10:44] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:10:44] <kyb> what

[15:11:00] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem
[15:11:06] <kyb> they want to do pagination
[15:11:07] <v0lksman> hello all!  is there a way to stop jquery ui from adding ui css classes to a widget?
[15:11:12] <aaronmcadam> they?
[15:11:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:11:16] <Compeeler> man, collision detection in jquery is messed
[15:11:25] <djQuery> kyb    $('divselector').css('display', 'block')
[15:11:28] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs @ Compeeler
[15:11:28] <bot-t> Compeeler, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:11:47] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: there's a few game libs out there
[15:11:53] <aaronmcadam> what u need is an algorithm
[15:12:13] <aaronmcadam> $('divselector').show()
[15:12:16] <aaronmcadam> same thing
[15:12:27] <Compeeler> Did i do the div1 and div2 thing right
[15:12:54] <Compeeler> divselector?  checks collisions?
[15:13:06] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:13:15] <aaronmcadam> that wouldn't make any sense
[15:13:19] <aaronmcadam> to add that to a library like jq
[15:13:26] <kyb> hey
[15:13:55] <Murof> Good night for ya guys ^^
[15:14:01] <Compeeler> soooooooo, i  guess um
[15:14:02] <Murof> happy coding

[15:15:37] <Murof> for now...
[15:15:41] <Murof> its enough
[15:15:48] <Zzaichik> that'll do
[15:15:54] <Murof> yeah :)
[15:15:55] <Compeeler> i still dont see the problem in my code, the collisions should work
[15:15:57] <aaronmcadam> I find most of the time actually reading the docs is beyond some people
[15:16:21] <aaronmcadam> did u make the fiddle Compeeler

[15:21:05] <Compeeler> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/1/   here it is bros, an updated version of the prob
[15:21:30] <kyb> ok
[15:22:22] <Zzaichik> hehe joshualibrarian  Here you go. http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/36/
[15:22:46] <Compeeler> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/3/   can anyone help me with collision in jquery
[15:23:15] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: Now I have to ask, do you see what I did? What was happening?
[15:23:20] <kyb> http://jsfiddle.net/bWFhj/
[15:23:22] <kyb> hi
[15:23:27] <kyb> this is not working?
[15:23:36] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  er... all I see is that you added !important...
[15:23:36] <aaronmcadam> ur code no worky Compeeler
[15:23:47] <Compeeler> whats wrong with it
[15:23:55] <kyb> mine
[15:23:57] <kyb> is no worky
[15:24:03] <Compeeler> it always thinks that there is a collision
[15:24:12] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: yep. And it works, right?
[15:24:14] <joshualibrarian> what, the semi-colon?
[15:24:22] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik: yes, it works!
[15:24:34] <Compeeler> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/3/    here it is again <<<<< if anyone could help, you will be blessed
[15:24:39] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: your CSS was over writing itself. So basically if it has a class of .disabled, that color takes priority with the !important
[15:24:58] <joshualibrarian> Zzaichik:  OH!
[15:25:01] <aaronmcadam> oh i get it
[15:25:30] <kyb> i dont get it man
[15:25:35] <kyb> its not copying
[15:25:41] <joshualibrarian> I had not even heard of that property!
[15:25:45] <Compeeler> woo hoo,
[15:25:47] <aaronmcadam> kyb: ur fiddle was wrong http://jsfiddle.net/bWFhj/1/
[15:25:55] <khmer> kyb: you don't need a script tag in the javascript panel of jsfiddle
[15:25:58] <Compeeler> :(
[15:26:07] <Compeeler> did you get what was wrong with mine
[15:26:12] <aaronmcadam> and it wasn't using jquery
[15:26:29] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian:  Well there you go! You learned.
[15:26:31] <joshualibrarian> THANK YOU!
[15:26:42] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian:  no problem
[15:26:48] * joshualibrarian is learning.  :)
[15:26:48] <Compeeler> i need to learn too, http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/3/
[15:26:55] <Zzaichik> hah
[15:27:00] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: so u want it to do something once it hits the other button
[15:27:06] <Compeeler> yeah :)
[15:27:06] <khmer> holy crap, jsfiddle supports scss and coffeescript now
[15:27:06] <khmer> IT BEGINS
[15:27:21] <aaronmcadam> ha! i was just thinking about having sass on it khmer
[15:27:28] <aaronmcadam> sexual
[15:27:29] <Zzaichik> Compeeler: indent your js man. I wasn't going to do it for you.
[15:27:46] <Zzaichik> having sass or less?! that would be man
[15:27:48] <aaronmcadam> awesome!
[15:27:52] <khmer> aaronmcadam: i agree
[15:27:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah it has scss!
[15:27:59] <khmer> extra sexual
[15:28:19] <Compeeler> uhh, do you mean the tidy up button
[15:28:22] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[15:28:33] <aaronmcadam> chriiiist
[15:28:38] <aaronmcadam> that's some if statement
[15:28:43] <Compeeler> chirst help me with my collisions
[15:28:52] <aaronmcadam> that logic is mental
[15:29:12] <Compeeler> logical
[15:29:15] <aaronmcadam> refactorrrr
[15:29:30] <aaronmcadam> and add in logs so u can see what's actually happening
[15:29:49] <Compeeler> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/6/
[15:29:57] <aaronmcadam> u got zero way of finding out which clause is true
[15:30:01] <Compeeler> ok i indented,
[15:30:17] <aaronmcadam> now change each clause into a function call
[15:30:20] <Zzaichik> where?!  how?! what?!   oh I found it - wow, I canna believe it
[15:30:20] <aaronmcadam> so u can tell
[15:30:33] <Compeeler> ya i did remembar
[15:30:40] <aaronmcadam> u didn't
[15:30:43] <Compeeler> button0button1()
[15:30:49] <aaronmcadam> still got a huge if statement
[15:30:58] <Compeeler> very huge
[15:31:01] <aaronmcadam> I'd slap somebody on my team for that
[15:31:08] <Compeeler> o god
[15:31:12] <aaronmcadam> how are u meant to read that
[15:31:16] <Zzaichik> baahahah - that is awesome.
[15:31:25] <Compeeler> i guess u sound it out
[15:31:29] <aaronmcadam> we got 4 subclauses
[15:31:34] <aaronmcadam> that's amazing
[15:31:58] <Compeeler> okk sooo the problem was
[15:32:03] <khmer> that's a hell of a test
[15:32:05] <Compeeler> do you know what the problem was
[15:32:06] <aaronmcadam> ohh 2 of em are nested
[15:32:17] <aaronmcadam> that's nice
[15:32:19] <Compeeler> nesting!!!!! i knew it!!! maybe
[15:32:40] <Compeeler> ok i didnt know it
[15:32:40] <aaronmcadam> if you refactored each test into it's own isBlah function it'd be easier
[15:33:07] <Compeeler> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[15:33:24] <aaronmcadam> u don't really need to bracket expressions
[15:33:28] <Compeeler> that would be alot
[15:33:34] <aaronmcadam> due to the way it gets evaluated
[15:33:38] <Compeeler> ok braackets = bad
[15:33:49] <aaronmcadam> (1+3) > (2+5)
[15:33:51] <aaronmcadam> no
[15:33:54] <khmer> i've got an amazing way to do it
[15:33:55] <aaronmcadam> but makes it harder to read
[15:33:59] <khmer> you guys are gonna love this
[15:34:04] <Compeeler> ok noted
[15:34:08] <aaronmcadam> plugiiiin
[15:34:22] <aaronmcadam> I'd say just the left value
[15:34:24] <aaronmcadam> would work
[15:34:34] <aaronmcadam> the left css prop
[15:34:39] <Compeeler> so i kill everything else
[15:35:00] <Compeeler> div1.offset().top + div1.outerHeight(true)  is on the left, i keep that one?
[15:35:14] <Compeeler> sry i dnt really get ya man
[15:35:46] <khmer> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/7/
[15:35:55] <khmer> BOOM
[15:36:25] <aaronmcadam> got exception
[15:36:26] <Compeeler> ok, i am clicking the link and i am very exicted
[15:36:32] <aaronmcadam> div1OffsetLeftPlusOuterHeightLessThanDiv2OffsetLeft is not defined
[15:36:35] <sphinxxx> what's absolutely necessary in an http header
[15:36:37] <sphinxxx> just host?
[15:36:40] <aaronmcadam> that's one crazy var name
[15:36:41] <khmer> aaronmcadam: oh whoops
[15:36:52] <khmer> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/8/
[15:37:01] <khmer> forgot to rename both instances
[15:37:16] <khmer> anyway, that's not a full refactor, but it should be a clue :)
[15:37:26] <Compeeler> okok i am clicking again, very excitingly
[15:37:44] <aaronmcadam> doesn't work
[15:37:46] <Compeeler> ahhh, is it supposed to do the same thing as before
[15:37:59] <aaronmcadam> it just immediately turns blue
[15:38:02] <Compeeler> oooooooooo
[15:38:13] <Compeeler> thx for trying my friend
[15:38:37] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:38:51] <aaronmcadam> so it's not actually animating right up against the button
[15:39:00] <aaronmcadam> due to ur left and top algo
[15:39:02] <aaronmcadam> so right
[15:39:14] <Compeeler> right
[15:39:42] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/La4je/5/
[15:39:45] <aaronmcadam> not perfect but
[15:40:02] <Compeeler> wow, nice!!! your beautiful
[15:40:10] <aaronmcadam> that ok?
[15:40:24] <Compeeler> it seems to work over here very well
[15:40:33] <aaronmcadam> might be some edge cases
[15:40:38] <aaronmcadam> not a pun :P
[15:41:06] <Compeeler> soo, this will only work if it touches the left side?
[15:41:08] <aaronmcadam> is it gonna be moving back left?
[15:41:09] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:41:14] <aaronmcadam> well
[15:41:18] <aaronmcadam> it's the left position
[15:41:30] <Compeeler> ah maybe, im just using this an example
[15:41:34] <khmer> here's another refactor that should get you closer
[15:41:34] <khmer> http://jsfiddle.net/NugcE/9/
[15:41:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:41:42] <aaronmcadam> the left won't change
[15:41:49] <aaronmcadam> there's no "right" property
[15:42:23] <BFranks> Finally got http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#display-grid doing something I want.. last issue I have with it is there's a '.' that just floats around near the cursor when I click the last element (box)
[15:42:41] <Compeeler> khmer, ummm i think its still doing the same thing as in the begining
[15:42:50] <BFranks> The "." doesn't show on any other boxes.. so it's kinda strange?
[15:43:01] <khmer> Compeeler: i'm not changing functionality; i'm just refactoring it to make your code clearer
[15:43:13] <khmer> also to save a few function invocations and perform better
[15:43:15] <Compeeler> ooooh i see, nice!!!
[15:43:19] <khmer> you shouldn't be calling div1.offset() five times
[15:43:24] <techouse> when sending a JS object over to PHP using $.ajax how does one go about? i know how to send simple data and arrays, but how do i send an object and use that with PHP
[15:43:27] <khmer> when it's the same result each time during execution
[15:43:30] <techouse> the same way as with arrays?
[15:43:36] <Compeeler> i most certainly should be not
[15:43:54] <chovy> techouse: you want to post a JSON object?
[15:44:25] <chovy> techouse: http://www.intelligrape.com/blog/2010/06/11/jquery-send-json-object-with-an-ajax-request/
[15:44:27] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: what did u want to happen when it comes back left
[15:44:30] <aaronmcadam> again
[15:44:34] <aaronmcadam> reset to black?
[15:44:47] <Compeeler> ah, same thing i guess
[15:44:55] <aaronmcadam> well it will already be red
[15:44:56] <Compeeler> change red again,
[15:45:07] <aaronmcadam> or do u want it to go black again once it's gone past the other button?
[15:45:07] <Compeeler> wait o, i mean
[15:45:16] <Compeeler> yeah,
[15:45:35] <Compeeler> that would be superb
[15:45:45] <techouse> chovy: actually i don't know how how to go about this.... never really gave objects in JS much of a thought
[15:45:47] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/La4je/8/
[15:45:51] <Compeeler> quick question, does this work with up and down too
[15:45:55] <aaronmcadam> gotta get it so it can see the right edge tho
[15:46:13] <techouse> what i did was make an object with 2 properties and well, used that in the $.ajax data segment
[15:46:21] <aaronmcadam> that's where the actual width will have to be looked at
[15:46:29] <techouse> you're saying i should make it to an json object first?
[15:46:57] <aaronmcadam> good old netsplit
[15:46:58] <Compeeler> woooooha
[15:47:05] <BFranks> Oh wait.. this is probably more jQueryUI FUD.. Cause on the demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#display-grid  .. dragging a selection area does not leave the dashed-gery selection lines visible, but on my version it does..
[15:47:06] <techouse> damn it :P
[15:47:09] <techouse> netsplit
[15:47:30] <BFranks> better than a ban_ana_split
[15:47:30] <aaronmcadam> right Compeeler this is where you can start adding back in some conditions
[15:47:46] <aaronmcadam> how is it fud exactly? lol
[15:48:00] <aaronmcadam> WrongContextException
[15:48:04] <Compeeler> coolness, soo, this method works, if it collides at direction? or only left and right
[15:48:13] <Flobin> Hi everyone. I have a (php + jquery) contact form on my website, but it's not working, so I was wondering if you guys could either help me make it work or maybe point me in the direction of a really simple contact form that even I can't screw up.
[15:48:15] <aaronmcadam> did u see my latest fiddle
[15:48:21] <Compeeler> yeah dud
[15:48:22] <aaronmcadam> i got it going back and forth
[15:48:28] <Flobin> the form in question is here http://viastedebouw.nl/event/index.php if you click on inschrijven
[15:48:32] <aaronmcadam> but it only goes red once it hits the left edge
[15:48:43] <aaronmcadam> so we need another function for the left key
[15:48:48] <Flobin> and I got it from here: http://www.scriptgenerator.net/78/ContactForm-v2/
[15:48:52] <sphinxxx> whats a good jquery image slider plugin if all i want is a simple slide or fade of a few images, with a "dot" navigation, thats all i need
[15:49:04] <Compeeler> lets say, the button was going up and down then colliding. would that work with this method?
[15:49:59] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: Sounds pretty easy to code natively
[15:51:19] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/La4je/9/
[15:51:34] <aaronmcadam> Compeeler: it looks like we're gonna need to look at an edge detection algorithm
[15:51:47] <Compeeler> ah dude, i dont think it works from the right side colliding
[15:51:51] <aaronmcadam> I mean rebuld it back up
[15:52:01] <aaronmcadam> I explained that already
[15:52:04] <Compeeler> .css('left')+button.xsize
[15:52:11] <aaronmcadam> xsize?
[15:52:21] <Compeeler> could we do something like that, to test for right side
[15:52:30] <Compeeler> ooo i mean width
[15:52:38] <barraponto> has http://planet.jquery.com/ been abandoned?
[15:52:42] <chovy> techouse: http://jsfiddle.net/rz8he/
[15:52:49] <aaronmcadam> is that valid?
[15:52:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:53:06] <aaronmcadam> that's what i said Compeeler
[15:53:19] <Compeeler> ooooo, naice
[15:54:33] <kyb> how do i copy text into an array
[15:54:41] <Compeeler> man o man
[15:54:58] <Compeeler> jquery was awesome until the collision checking
[15:55:10] <Eviltwin> ?
[15:55:12] <BFranks> Oh ok I see what I am doing.. as I am selecting I'm building an index of the 'values' of the <li> elements in the <ol> .. as I select the last element it would hit an 'undefined' value which is probably halting the current execution.. So if I drag a box around all elements except the last, the cleanup works.. but the moment I hit the last box it hangs and there's no cleanup done
[15:55:24] <aaronmcadam> what are u on about Compeeler don't blame jQuery lol
[15:55:49] <Compeeler> there should be an event already built in or something
[15:55:58] <Eviltwin> A jQuery event for...?
[15:56:17] <aaronmcadam> that'd be stupid
[15:56:24] <aaronmcadam> Eviltwin: edge detection
[15:56:34] <Compeeler> it would be the best man
[15:57:41] <Compeeler> gtg peace
[15:57:44] <aaronmcadam> no the use case isn't general enough
[15:57:46] <aaronmcadam> ha
[15:58:31] <Eviltwin> It would be the best if jQuery had events for what I wish jQuery had events for
[15:58:31] <aaronmcadam> first "bros" and thennow "peace"
[15:58:33] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:58:59] <aaronmcadam> i kept saying see ?jsisjs to him but to no avail
[15:58:59] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:59:15] <techouse> chovy: in order to use JSON.stringify one has to include json.js / json-sans-eval.js or can jquery do it on its own
[15:59:32] <aaronmcadam> $.writeMyCodeForMe() is a brilliant method Eviltwin
[15:59:47] <aaronmcadam> no techouse, only parse
[16:00:05] <aaronmcadam> check for the native JSON object first before u include it
[16:00:41] <techouse> aaronmcadam: meaning?
[16:00:43] <chovy> techouse: what browsers do you need to su pport?
[16:01:00] <techouse> chovy: from ie7 upwards :/
[16:01:07] <aaronmcadam> if (typeof JSON == 'undefined') {
[16:01:07] <aaronmcadam>     document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='/js/json2.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
[16:01:07] <aaronmcadam> }
[16:01:14] <aaronmcadam> sorry bout the multiline lads
[16:01:21] <techouse> aah, that, ok
[16:01:36] <aaronmcadam> webkit and ffox have it natively
[16:01:44] <aaronmcadam> no point downloading an extra script
[16:02:07] <techouse> well, if i don't use objects i end up having to make 2 ajax calls
[16:02:11] <techouse> so... :/
[16:02:16] <aaronmcadam> what?
[16:02:26] <aaronmcadam> ?serialize @ techouse
[16:02:26] <bot-t> techouse, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[16:02:34] <aaronmcadam> see ?serializeArray otherwise
[16:02:34] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[16:02:35] <aaroninfidel> anyone wanna race? http://coderace.me
[16:02:40] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:02:53] <aaronmcadam> I'll check that some time
[16:03:12] <aaronmcadam> can I use vim?
[16:03:13] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:03:35] <aaroninfidel> nope unfortunately its a web based editor
[16:03:36] <aaronmcadam> snippets and zen coding ftw if there's html races haha
[16:03:38] <aaroninfidel> but its not too bad.
[16:03:39] <chovy> techouse: json2
[16:03:42] <chovy> if < ie7
[16:03:45] <aaronmcadam> what is it?
[16:03:47] <aaronmcadam> Ace?
[16:03:55] <aaronmcadam> CodeMirror?
[16:03:57] <techouse> chovy: ok
[16:03:57] <aaroninfidel> probably a fork of it
[16:04:19] <chovy> techouse: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1480393/alternatives-of-json-stringify-in-javascript
[16:04:20] <aaronmcadam> if < IE7?
[16:04:29] <aaronmcadam> ie7 has native JSON?
[16:04:46] <nicholasschulz> I might have overdone the whole jquery thingy.. Because when users navigate the jquery lags because the content must load (so slideDown() is having a latency before it know how much to expand)â€¦ Any solution to this? Try clicking the "Selg" nav http://bannaky.com/
[16:05:10] <aaronmcadam> slide it down in the callback
[16:05:23] <aaronmcadam> if it's ajax content
[16:05:49] <nicholasschulz> now I use load()
[16:05:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:05:54] <chovy> aaronmcadam: sorry, if <= IE7
[16:06:01] <aaronmcadam> ie8 has native?
[16:06:07] <chovy> yea
[16:06:07] <aaronmcadam> didn't get that memop
[16:06:09] <aaronmcadam> shite
[16:06:23] <aaronmcadam> nice
[16:06:26] <chovy> nobody gets the memos from MS.
[16:06:35] <red_square> nicholasschulz you keep loading jquery
[16:06:44] <red_square> I know have 10 copied of it in your page
[16:06:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:06:48] <red_square> now!
[16:06:54] <josh9> i am fetching a json file from my own machine and get a 'access-control-allow-origin' error. i use backbone.js if it matters.
[16:07:09] <aaronmcadam> is this chrome?
[16:07:10] <nicholasschulz> aaronmcadam will ajax solve this? and why?
[16:07:10] <chovy> josh9: cross domain?
[16:07:11] <josh9> exercise.activities.fetch({async: false});
[16:07:13] <aaronmcadam> with the file protocol?
[16:07:15] <josh9> chovy: yes
[16:07:20] <aaronmcadam> haha oh god no nicholasschulz
[16:07:28] <chovy> josh9: you need to add the headers in your response.
[16:07:28] <aaronmcadam> depends how you're using load
[16:07:49] <josh9> chovy: it's just html + js. no server code involved.
[16:08:03] <aaronmcadam> is it chrome?
[16:08:05] <josh9> chovy: i follow this tutorial - http://blog.chariotsolutions.com/2011/12/introduction-to-backbonejs-with-jquery.html
[16:08:09] <josh9> aaronmcadam: yes. chrome
[16:08:10] <chovy> josh9: like a local file?
[16:08:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:08:14] <chovy> From the desktop?
[16:08:15] <josh9> chovy: correct
[16:08:19] <aaronmcadam> and are you loading the file with the file protocol?
[16:08:21] <chovy> yeah. that won't work.
[16:08:22] <aaronmcadam> file:///
[16:08:29] <chovy> Setup a web server.
[16:08:31] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:08:33] <aaronmcadam> node
[16:08:36] <aaronmcadam> 3 line web server
[16:08:36] <josh9>  url: "exercise.json"
[16:08:44] <aaronmcadam> could even paste it here in irc for ye
[16:08:44] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:09:09] <Eviltwin> People need to stop following tutorials
[16:09:24] <josh9> aaronmcadam: so i have to set up my sinatra/node server?
[16:09:27] <chovy> aaronmcadam: http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/one_line_python.html
[16:09:31] <aaronmcadam> josh: var connect = require('connect');
[16:09:32] <aaronmcadam> connect.createServer(
[16:09:32] <aaronmcadam>   connect.static(__dirname + '/public')
[16:09:32] <aaronmcadam> ).listen(10000);
[16:09:34] <aaronmcadam> simples
[16:09:35] <chovy> josh9: http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/one_line_python.html
[16:09:42] <josh9> ok. thank you guys
[16:10:01] <chovy> or install apache
[16:10:09] <aaronmcadam> nginx even
[16:10:12] <aaronmcadam> doesn't matter
[16:10:17] <josh9> i like sinatra
[16:10:26] <aaronmcadam> whatever gets the job done
[16:10:30] <chovy> i would use whatever your production env. will use.
[16:10:34] <josh9> but the node.js sounds cool as welll
[16:10:37] <aaronmcadam> i love node cuz i just have to paste my server file anywhere
[16:10:42] <aaronmcadam> and i get a server
[16:10:44] <aaronmcadam> zero config
[16:10:58] <aaronmcadam> handy for livereload
[16:11:11] <chovy> i like php still. every web host supports it.
[16:11:24] <chovy> to run node js you need to overpay for hosting.
[16:11:25] <techouse> chovy: LOL google closure compresses json2.js from 17kb to 2.5 kb?!
[16:11:28] <aaronmcadam> because the websockets protocol keeps bloody switching around, the file:// protocol fucks up
[16:11:30] <techouse> w00t
[16:11:57] <aaronmcadam> chovy: I'm just talkin bout simple static servers for local dev when that's all u need
[16:12:17] <aaronmcadam> like Pow for mac
[16:12:34] <chovy> mac has apache built in.
[16:12:34] <aaronmcadam> but i'm on linux so I use my tiny node static server file
[16:12:52] <aaronmcadam> it has some special stuff in it's hosts
[16:12:54] <chovy> if i were developing a node app i would use node.
[16:13:27] <aaronmcadam> so would I lol
[16:14:15] <aaronmcadam> I just like the lack of hoop jumping i get with node
[16:14:20] <igcewieling> I have two very similar lines of JQuery code, one generates an error, one does not.
[16:14:26] <aaronmcadam> nice
[16:14:30] <igcewieling> Works: $('#route_edit .btn_switch_name').html('via ' + $('#route_edit select[name="btn_switch_sid"] option:selected' + '').text());
[16:14:46] <igcewieling> Doesn't work: $('#route_edit .btn_switch_name').html('via <span style="font-weight:bold;">' + $('#route_edit select[name="btn_switch_sid"] option:selected' + '<span>').text());
[16:14:55] <chovy> aaronmcadam: do you have your config file on github?
[16:14:55] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[16:15:01] <aaronmcadam> config?
[16:15:04] <aaronmcadam> for what?
[16:15:08] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: Recheck your patantheses
[16:15:14] <Eviltwin> parantheses*
[16:15:19] <Eviltwin> Where the span starts and ends
[16:15:21] <chovy> aaronmcadam: your node server
[16:15:23] <igcewieling> the one which does not work generates aUncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: > error in jquery-1.7.1-min.js
[16:15:26] <aaronmcadam> think so one min
[16:15:57] <aaronmcadam> i'll stick it up now
[16:16:00] <chovy> jquery has a 'background: none' bug which crashes IE8
[16:16:13] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: Look at your '<span>' and where it is
[16:16:22] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: thanks.  I don't know how I missed that.
[16:16:35] <Eviltwin> Please spend a little more time looking at your code before running here
[16:18:46] <someprimetime> so http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/13/ does br: not target <br /> tags? only <br> ?
[16:19:13] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[16:19:39] <someprimetime> well i mean, if i put in <br> in the html markup, it works fine
[16:20:00] <someprimetime> but <br /> is what is being generated by pylons
[16:20:01] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Open up Firebug or whatever
[16:20:07] <Eviltwin> You have a glaring error
[16:20:14] <someprimetime> wat
[16:20:17] <someprimetime> k 1 sec
[16:20:39] <aaronmcadam> chovy: https://github.com/aaronmcadam/node_static_server/blob/master/static_server.js
[16:20:39] <someprimetime> oh wtf http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/14/
[16:20:45] <someprimetime> ok, weird
[16:20:46] <someprimetime> this works
[16:21:00] <someprimetime> ugh. damn mako templates
[16:21:20] <someprimetime> i hate when stuff works on jsfiddle and then i convert it into existing code and it fails
[16:21:22] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin
[16:21:54] <nicholasschulz> Can one use beforeSend() when using $.get ?
[16:22:06] <nicholasschulz> or load () ?
[16:22:25] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: Both $.get and .load use $.ajax internally
[16:23:01] <nicholasschulz> So that is a yes, correct? How do you implement it?
[16:23:19] <Eviltwin> You use $.ajax instead of $.get or .load when you want to beforeSend
[16:23:33] <nicholasschulz> Got it, thanks :-)
[16:26:38] <aaronmcadam> chovy: here, had to mess with the repo: https://github.com/aaronmcadam/node_static_server
[16:33:04] <chovy> aaronmcadam: that will actually serve files?
[16:33:08] <aaronmcadam> yup
[16:33:18] <aaronmcadam> refresh the page i've added a quick readme
[16:34:08] <imsky> wat abjorn wat
[16:34:09] <chovy> aaronmcadam: https://github.com/chovy/nodejs-stream/blob/master/stream.js
[16:34:21] <chovy> I had to put headers etc. in mine.
[16:34:28] <chovy> look at line 92.
[16:34:55] <aaronmcadam> why aren't u using connect?
[16:35:18] <aaronmcadam> wow dude
[16:35:24] <aaronmcadam> connect.static is there for a reason lol
[16:35:44] <abjorn> imsky: sup
[16:35:55] <imsky> tired from writing scheme code abjorn
[16:35:57] <imsky> head horts
[16:36:01] <imsky> want sleep
[16:36:55] <chovy> aaronmcadam: i didn't know about connect.static
[16:37:01] <aaronmcadam> now ya do :)
[16:37:16] <aaronmcadam> nice firehose project
[16:37:26] <chovy> yea
[16:37:32] <aaronmcadam> why are u redefining variables?
[16:37:33] <chovy> it isn't very usable.
[16:37:37] <chovy> It's just a stream.
[16:37:40] <aaronmcadam> var options = ...
[16:37:44] <aaronmcadam> var options = ...
[16:37:45] <abjorn> lol why were you writing scheme, imsky
[16:37:54] <aaronmcadam> and then again
[16:37:56] <aaronmcadam> that's bad form
[16:38:10] <imsky> abjorn: i'm in school for that science of computers
[16:38:29] <aaronmcadam> actually that whole thing could be refactored way down chovy
[16:38:30] <chovy> aaronmcadam: yeah. this code actualloy needs some refactoring.
[16:38:48] <aaronmcadam> seriously heh
[16:38:53] <chovy> i should put them in a doTwitter() and a doMeetup() function, but I'm not sure how to organize it.
[16:39:10] <aaronmcadam> don't make the function names specific
[16:39:23] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn't matter whether it's twitter or not
[16:39:56] <aaronmcadam> is the spawning working ok toh
[16:39:58] <aaronmcadam> tho*
[16:41:02] <aaronmcadam> you need a requestHandler function chovy
[16:42:39] <aaronmcadam> anyway i'm out cya
[16:44:04] <abjorn> imsky: oh my word
[16:44:24] <imsky> abjorn: it's due in 4 hours. i started 2 hours ago
[16:45:04] <imsky> wanna fuck your brain a little? write a prog that figures out all the unbound variables in a prog
[16:45:11] <someprimetime> anyone know off the top of their head which of these functions aren't compatible with 1.5.2? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/n4jnr/14/
[16:45:34] <someprimetime> i always use 1.7 on jsfiddle, and on my dev server use 1.5.2
[16:45:57] <someprimetime> ah, is()?
[16:46:06] <someprimetime> no.
[16:48:06] <_zoggy_> i need to add some tabs to a page. i have two div of content (a pre with some info inside). i see jquery ui works fine.. but i'd have to have each tab a unique id.. i'd rather just use the same class name... but jui doesnt like this..
[16:48:11] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: It is .is
[16:48:13] <_zoggy_> suggestions on solution / plugins  to try
[16:48:40] <someprimetime> ah, yeah i noticed that the newer version of is compares objects rather than strings (introduced in 1.6)
[16:48:52] <Eviltwin> Ye
[16:48:53] <Eviltwin> s
[16:49:01] <abjorn> imsky: motherofgod.jpg
[16:49:14] <imsky> abjorn: lol :[
[16:49:25] <imsky> then there's this fuckery
[16:49:45] <imsky> (((((a b) c) d) e) f))))))))))
[16:50:05] <imsky> which at some point becomes ((((((free-var a) (free-var b)) (free-var c)) (var 2)) (var 1)) (var 0))))))
[16:51:32] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: since "is" is usually a stop word in searches, is there an equivalent to is that i can find somewhere?
[16:51:42] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Read what it does
[16:51:45] <someprimetime> or would $(this) === $marker
[16:52:04] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: That's answered on the first page of jqfundamentals, I believe
[16:52:28] <someprimetime> ?jqfundamentals @ someprimetime
[16:52:29] <bot-t> someprimetime, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[16:52:52] <someprimetime> oh this is the money shot
[16:52:55] <someprimetime> thanks
[16:59:16] <imsky> abjorn: wtf mate. i just solved the problem that's been stumping me for hours
[16:59:34] <imsky> I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW I KNEW WHAT TO TYPE
[17:01:09] <aximilation> imsky: I think that means you just got lucky
[17:01:10] <aximilation> :D
[17:01:18] <imsky> i think this is what genius feels like
[17:01:27] <imsky> OOPS A MAJOR DISCOVERY
[17:04:23] <richardr> The 'pageload' event in jQuery Mobile doesn't fire if you navigate to pages within the jQuery mobile experience using AJAX. Is there any event to detect page load (after dom loaded) in jQuery Mobile AFTER the initial load?
[17:12:31] <abjorn> lol imsky
[17:16:39] <kyb> hi
[17:16:44] <kyb> does split work by tags
[17:17:01] <kyb> i mean if i run into <pagebreak></pagebreak>
[17:17:03] <kyb> i wanna split it
[17:17:55] <chovy> kyb: what are you trying to do?
[17:18:12] <chovy> $("pagerank").text() // ?
[17:18:52] <kyb> well i got a long paragraph
[17:18:57] <kyb> and they want to do some kinda pagination
[17:19:05] <kyb> so they want to add a tag
[17:19:10] <kyb> into the paragraph
[17:19:14] <kyb> like <pagebreak/>
[17:19:28] <kyb> and then when jquery sees that it splits it into an array
[17:19:35] <kyb> and the index of the array is the pages
[17:19:46] <kyb> and when a user clicks on the page numbers at the bottom
[17:19:52] <kyb> it will load the div with different htmal
[17:20:10] <kyb> but how do i split on the tag?
[17:20:25] <kyb> var substr = $('#hidden-div').text().split("pagebreak");
[17:20:29] <kyb> that doesnt seem to do
[17:20:30] <kyb> it
[17:22:31] <kyb> hello
[17:24:45] <raadad> hey guys
[17:24:54] <kyb> damn it
[17:24:58] <kyb> .text()
[17:25:04] <kyb> doesnt take tags within the div?
[17:25:08] <raadad> :)
[17:25:10] <kyb> how do i get all the content?
[17:25:23] <raadad> im using bootstrap css, how do i adjust
[17:25:24] <Tobbi> Is there an easy way to make sure registered handlers are not registered multiple times on a specific element?
[17:27:10] <patrick99e99> is there a more hip way to write:  if ($('foobar').css('opacity') != '1')   ?
[17:32:12] <symbolic> kyb: so pagebreak only appears once at the bottom of each page?
[17:35:53] <symbolic> kyb: if pagebreak is always a sibling to the div (which contains all page content) then its easy in jquery
[18:07:48] <richardr> Is there a dedicated IRC channel for jQuery Mobile?
[18:08:55] <CaptDoDo> #jquerymobile
[18:13:45] <solidus-lake> is there a way to delay initializing anything untill after all images are loaded?
[18:27:09] <patrick99e99> hey buddies... Is there a more cool way to write if ($('#foo').css('opacity') != '1')) { ... }  ?
[18:28:16] <Bankzilla> patrick99e99 why are you looking for a more cool way? it's not a fashion competition
[18:28:23] <Bankzilla> If it works it work right
[18:29:18] <rchgonzaga> You mean ... Cool way or right way ?
[18:29:41] <polorix> hey guys, this may be a fun one on trying to figure out. Look at the date box i have on this site and then look at it in ie9: http://midwestclaims.ca/
[18:34:27] <patrick99e99> Bankzilla: I want to be in style with the times, man
[18:35:16] <Bankzilla> patrick99e99: your statement is correct, from what i see that is as basic as you can write it
[18:36:17] <dsdeiz> hi! is there a way to select "#something" but not "#".. tried ^= but it still selected "#"
[18:37:17] <Bankzilla> dsdeiz are you talking about you want to get info from something with the id of #something?
[18:39:12] <dsdeiz> anything like #[some text]
[18:39:14] <bonhoffer> hmm. . .if i know the url returns json, why is this not working? $.getJSON("/calendar/events/4f20ba65fdffdc4ce8000003",function(events) { alert(events); });
[18:39:15] <tw2113> should it be possible to use the jQuery Cycle plugin where clicking the slide links to an external url?
[18:41:15] <tw2113> guess i spoke too soon
[18:47:37] <Bankzilla> dsdeiz: can you give an example of the code you're trying to access as I can't picture what you're talking about
[18:48:16] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: you're missing the success parameter
[18:48:57] <bonhoffer> Bankzilla, thanks
[18:49:09] <Bankzilla> ?getjson @bonhoffer
[18:49:09] <bot-t> bonhoffer, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[18:50:52] <bonhoffer> Bankzilla, i'm confused, i have a datepicker that attaches to <div id="123" class=".calendar"></div>, i want to getJSON for the url "/data/123" how can i do that?
[18:51:29] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: for a start why do you have a class called ..calender?
[18:51:57] <firebalrog> Lol
[18:52:24] <bonhoffer> ha
[18:52:28] <bonhoffer> i don't
[18:52:48] <bonhoffer> class="blog_calendar" reality -- but i might have multiple calendars per page
[18:54:53] <bonhoffer> so i want get json from "/data/123" for <div id="123" class="foo"></div>
[18:56:36] <Bankzilla> $.ajax({ url:  'data/123', datatype: 'json', success: function(){..} });
[18:56:37] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: wouldn't you simply do
[18:56:48] <bonhoffer> there is no try -- just do
[18:58:18] <dsdeiz> Bankzilla: i'm trying to find a way to match a tags with hrefs that would contain a hashtag but not an element with just a hashtag in it
[18:58:45] <dsdeiz> this seem to work fine a[href*=#]:not(a[href$=#]) not sure if it's right tho
[18:59:14] <ch3mical_> dsdeiz: use classes to mark the anchors you want to match
[19:02:52] <abjorn> Ahh, Linus Torvalds, with such enlightening G+ posts as "Our cat is defective"
[19:02:53] <Bankzilla> dsdeiz: Are you talking about flags? if not I'm not to sure what you're trying to say
[19:03:55] <bonhoffer> Bankzilla, did you comment get cut off  .. . would love to see the end . . .
[19:04:45] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: my example i pasted above my comment by mistake
[19:04:58] <bonhoffer> ah . . . i see
[19:05:17] <bonhoffer> no i can't do that -- i don't know the id 123
[19:05:52] <abjorn> imsky: You ever watch Portlandia?
[19:06:03] <imsky> abjorn: seen all the episodes brah
[19:06:03] <bonhoffer> that is my problem . . . want get json from "/data/xxx" for <div id="xxx" class="foo"></div> where xxx is an arbitrary id
[19:06:10] <abjorn> lol
[19:06:13] <abjorn> im just starting to watch it
[19:06:23] <imsky> it's a good show
[19:06:32] <imsky> you'll never look at austin the same way
[19:06:48] <abjorn> lol
[19:07:14] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: The calendar is attched to the div with id="xx"? why not listen for the click event and get the parents id. Then you can preform your ajax call
[19:07:40] <bonhoffer> there is no click event . . . i need the events to load on dom loading
[19:11:37] <Bankzilla> How is the id getting set?
[19:12:37] <kyb> how do i add <a tags inside a div with jquery?
[19:14:21] <firebalrog> .append('<a....
[19:14:33] <bonhoffer> Bankzilla, the page is served up by ruby
[19:14:41] <bonhoffer> so the id exists in the page
[19:20:01] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: gimmie a sec setting up a jsfiddle
[19:20:12] <bonhoffer> thanks!
[19:21:55] <Tobbi> Does .val understand += ?
[19:22:09] <Bankzilla> bonhoffer: http://jsfiddle.net/WpCEB/ It's broken due to data/xxx not existing but this is what you are wanting i think
[19:22:20] <bonhoffer> looking
[19:23:28] <Bankzilla> ahh my bad should be http://jsfiddle.net/WpCEB/1/
[19:29:39] <bonhoffer> looking again . .
[19:30:14] <bonhoffer> ok -- i like that -- there might even be an each iterator, right?
[19:31:55] <Bankzilla> i don't think it would be needed
[19:32:16] <Bankzilla> up to you though, you have a base code now
[19:32:39] <abjorn> imsky: rofl this bicyclists bit...SURE REMINDS ME OF HOME
[19:32:50] <bonhoffer> Bankzilla, very appreciated
[19:32:55] <imsky> that whole show is going to remind you of your life soon abjorn
[19:33:48] <abjorn> lol
[19:38:15] <codepal> I'm at a dead end -- what I want to do, and what my skills are at opposition --- http://jsfiddle.net/t9kPy/
[19:38:46] <codepal> I need to hide the div / make the div that's popping up visible to start with instead..
[19:38:53] <codepal> but then I can't test on visibility....
[19:40:10] <firebalrog> See dialog in jquery ui
[19:40:17] <bonhoffer> so close . . .i have "03/12/2011" and i want .valueOf() so i want to cast to a date
[19:40:50] <bonhoffer> this isn't working (new Date("03/12/2011")).valueOf()
[19:42:08] <bonhoffer> there is $.datepicker.parseDate("mm/dd/yyyy", "03/12/2011")
[19:42:48] <codepal> http://jsfiddle.net/t9kPy/1/ --- is working but not very elegant
[19:42:53] <codepal> dialog?
[19:44:15] <codepal> ohhhh dialog!
[19:44:21] <codepal> well thanks
[19:44:34] <detaos> hello all.  i'm loading some dynamic html via an AJAX call and would like to turn one of the text boxes into a date picker, but calling $("#editset_date").datepicker(); after the html has loaded has no effect.
[19:45:15] <aca20031> have yo uadded the loaded html to the dom of the current page?
[19:45:20] <aca20031> s/yo u/you/
[19:45:55] <detaos> document.getElementById("#editor").innerHTML = loaded_html;
[19:46:06] <detaos> -#
[19:46:21] <aca20031> which you do -before- you try to call .datepicker yes?
[19:46:27] <detaos> yes
[19:47:00] <detaos> oh no!  thanks mate!
[19:47:02] <mouse-_> hey guys ! i was wondering if anyone knew of any plugins that would show text in a teletype-like format/speed (300/1200 baud or whatnot)
[19:47:05] <aca20031> lol
[19:47:36] <detaos> i'm still trying to get used to this anonymous function call thing and its implications on code execution order.
[19:49:31] <jiMuBao> has any one has experience with jquery mobile's scroll view ?
[19:50:02] <jiMuBao> basically i want it to scroll to the bottom when page on load
[19:50:03] <firebalrog> codepal: did you find dialog in the jquery-ui
[19:50:59] <codepal> nm - sorted it with delay(), fadeIn() & fadeOut()
[19:51:08] <codepal> much tidier / nicer
[19:51:18] <codepal> dialog isn't really what I need
[19:51:29] <codepal> as I'm doing a panel type popup from the bottom of the page
[19:52:19] <firebalrog> well worth the look
[19:52:59] <detaos> mouse-_: don't know of any plugins, but it's be relatively trivial to store user input in a buffer and output characters from the buffer in a delayed fashion using setTimeout.
[19:54:23] <Bankzilla> jiMuBao join #jquery-mobile
[19:55:03] <Bankzilla> jiMuBao: my bad it's #jquerymobile
[19:56:19] <solidus-lake> is there a way to bind a function to an event?
[19:56:35] <solidus-lake> ie, dont attach a function to an event from an object, but bind a function to be called on an event globally
[19:57:54] <codepal> so yeah -- firebalrog == final results = http://jsfiddle.net/t9kPy/2/
[19:58:16] <solidus-lake> i guess i could do .on
[19:58:23] <solidus-lake> on any element i want to bind that event too
[19:58:31] <Bankzilla> ?bind @solidus-lake
[19:58:32] <bot-t> solidus-lake, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[19:58:32] <solidus-lake> i guess thats the thing to do
[20:02:23] <firebalrog> codepal: nice job
[20:02:29] <codepal> thanks!
[20:02:32] <codepal> wb
[20:03:06] <codepal> only extra thing is to move the arrow up to the top of the open div
[20:05:55] <joshualibrarian1> If I create a .click event handler from a selector which will cover multiple items in the DOM, what is the syntax for accessing the current object that was actually clicked on?  Like this:  $('#nav .navList a').click(function({ var x = this.attr('id'); });
[20:10:38] <kborchers> joshualibrarian1: $(this).attr("id");
[20:12:43] <solidus-lake> this is very wierd
[20:14:25] <joshualibrarian1> kborchers:  every time I try it, I get "missing : after property id"... can I not do var x = $(this).attr("id"); ?  do I have to chain something after it?
[20:15:00] <kborchers> ?demo @ joshualibrarian1
[20:15:00] <bot-t> joshualibrarian1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:19:50] <kyb> does jquery .split work in ie7?

[20:44:34] <Symbolic> Josh: I see the problem
[20:45:01] <joshualibrarian1> it still doesn't work!
[20:45:30] <Symbolic> You passed a javascript object as a func param

[20:50:32] <Symbolic> For click function, I would use function(e) {...
[20:50:34] <codepal> firebalrog, -- whew finished, only because I like fiddling : http://jsfiddle.net/t9kPy/3/ :
[20:51:28] <Symbolic> You have function({... which is wrong
[20:52:01] <joshualibrarian1> OH
[20:52:58] * joshualibrarian1 finds jquery syntax confusing.
[20:53:38] <firebalrog> codepal: not quite arrow should not be put on box until after the box is displayed in endind animation but still only a little way to go
[20:53:58] <firebalrog> bottom line nice
[20:54:23] <Symbolic> josh: it is just standard javascript
[20:55:05] <kborchers> ?learn @ joshualibrarian1
[20:55:06] <bot-t> joshualibrarian1, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:56:53] <Symbolic> I have a lots of experience with javascript but I'm new to jquery
[20:57:37] <firebalrog> think syntatical sugar to work with dom
[20:57:40] <imsky> abjorn: fffffffuuuuuuuu still had 2 problems left
[21:00:32] <abjorn> lol
[21:00:34] <abjorn> get on it, son

[21:02:19] <Phrogz> Quiet, you two.
[21:02:20] <abjorn> you know
[21:02:21] <abjorn> just
[21:02:21] <progrock`> Symbolic: if you have a lot f experience with javascript, and know css.. should take a whole 30 mintes o become a pro
[21:02:52] <abjorn> that might be a bit of an exaggeration, progrock
[21:02:58] <imsky> abjorn: scheme gangstas for life!
[21:03:00] <progrock`> abjorn: I dont tihnk so
[21:03:07] <imsky> the funny thing is you can rewrite most of that in idiomatic js
[21:03:19] <progrock`> maybe an hour.... not to omuch you need to cover if you really know JS and CSS
[21:03:31] <abjorn> imsky: I've had way too little sleep and done way too much work to even make heads or tails of that
[21:03:46] <abjorn> difference between being a pro and have a good grasp of it
[21:03:51] <abjorn> @progrock
[21:03:54] <Symbolic> I have, but dont know all tricks of the trade
[21:04:01] <abjorn> no one does
[21:04:10] <abjorn> except ben_alman
[21:04:11] <imsky> abjorn: you and me both buddy, i've been up since 8 AM doing prop logic and proofs of prime numbers and shit
[21:04:18] <progrock`> abjorn: if we're judging pro based on sa 2 standard deviatiosn fom average person in here.. then no
[21:04:26] <abjorn> woah now

[21:04:55] <imsky> one day i'll look back on these times
[21:04:58] <imsky> and wonder wtf (if (or (null? ls) (not (memq (car bl) ls))) is
[21:05:06] <abjorn> me too
[21:05:10] <abjorn> I'll start doing that right now
[21:05:24] <imsky> SO READABLE AND ELEGANT
[21:05:31] <imsky> even has procedural programming BUILT RIGHT IN
[21:05:36] <abjorn> just like my coffeescripts
[21:05:41] <imsky> >:|
[21:05:46] <abjorn> rofl
[21:05:51] <imsky> coffeescript: considered doucheful
[21:05:58] <abjorn> lol
[21:06:14] <abjorn> coffeescript considered: an unnecessary compile step
[21:06:43] <imsky> no no
[21:06:48] <imsky> no my friend
[21:06:48] <progrock`> ugh, I just cant get over the lak of 'var' in coffeescript
[21:06:50] <imsky> let me tell you something
[21:07:02] <abjorn> http://i.imgur.com/PyGXd.jpg
[21:07:22] <imsky> first you write things in dart, then compile to js, then transcode to coffeescript, and then put it into coffee-clojure or whatevs, and then finally run it in a scheme interpreter
[21:07:40] <imsky> clojurescript, that's it
[21:07:56] <imsky> MOR ELEGENT
[21:08:49] <abjorn> that guy

[21:12:44] <abjorn> progrock`: then you do it, they take it, never call you back, and use what you made in production?
[21:13:00] <progrock`> I really wasnt very interested in them.. but if I didnt have other offers, i was gonna consider... but yeah.. got plenty of offers betwen then
[21:13:09] <abjorn> i kid, but idk maybe
[21:13:13] <abjorn> i suppose it depends on how well they pay
[21:13:31] <progrock`> abjorn: haha, no they ar a little too big to pull that kind fo shit.. andn they did call bacj.. just way too late, and way too shitty a position
[21:14:08] <abjorn> well, I got an email about them wanting to set up an interview and all, at least from the sounds of it
[21:14:15] <progrock`> tho never talked money, who knows.. maybe tey pay well.. but if you know what youre doing, and in a big city.. ou better  be making 6 figures
[21:14:27] <abjorn> after they saw my github lol

[21:15:38] <imsky> bro if you work in advertising
[21:15:45] <imsky> then legit mates
[21:15:58] <imsky> because nowhere else do you get to dick around with the latest tech
[21:16:05] <imsky> and force IT interns to make it work with IE6
[21:16:21] <abjorn> lol
[21:16:28] <progrock`> imsky: totally wrong... advertising you have to support majority of browsers.. sucks
[21:16:39] <progrock`> my current positoin, no IE support what so ever, lol
[21:16:46] <abjorn> he's saying you can make interns do it
[21:16:51] <abjorn> which would be lol
[21:16:52] <progrock`> heh, goodluck with that one
[21:17:02] <abjorn> I don't think it quite works like that
[21:17:15] <imsky> abjorn: i'm getting into the ads business, you better believe it works like that

[21:18:30] <imsky> are you retired progrock`
[21:18:47] <abjorn> idk, honestly I do really like working at hostgator, so idk that i'd move
[21:19:14] <progrock`> retired, lol.. no, i got a few years before that one.. quite a few
[21:19:18] <abjorn> oh lol btw imsky they rewrote our frontend chat system again it looks like
[21:19:26] <abjorn> but now it's using html5 boilerplate!
[21:19:27] <imsky> lol
[21:19:30] <abjorn> becausethat's something that's needed
[21:19:31] <imsky> THIS TIME WITH BUZZWORDS
[21:19:36] <abjorn> ^
[21:19:50] <imsky> abjorn: i'm using that portable node to quickly prototype/test js
[21:19:51] <imsky> so good
[21:19:56] <coldhead> html5 boilerplate is so last year, it's all about twitter bootstrap now
[21:20:04] <imsky> coldhead: bootstrap v2
[21:20:05] <progrock`> abjorn: wow, I'm in shock host gator stays in busines.. at least thir VPS offerings are sub par
[21:20:10] <abjorn> they did make it look somewhat professional looking: https://chatlite.hostgator.com
[21:20:15] <abjorn> progrock`: shared hosting
[21:20:17] <abjorn> that's why
[21:20:21] <progrock`> oh, gtcha
[21:20:23] <abjorn> and dedis to a smaller extent
[21:20:34] <abjorn> there's not a lot of cost overhead to get fully managed dedis so
[21:21:04] <abjorn> nah, trust me the company is doing real well for itself
[21:21:19] <progrock`> heh, we pay rackspace something lik 20k a month for all out shit, lol
[21:21:26] <abjorn> VPS aren't it's strong suit imo, at least not with companies like linode and rackspace
[21:21:37] <abjorn> but it's just different parts of the market, you know
[21:22:03] <progrock`> yup... glad to be using the vps side of things.. but obviously I see why a lot of people go shared if they dont know their shit
[21:22:29] <abjorn> even if you do there's plenty of situations where shared hosting makes more sense
[21:22:39] <progrock`> but never got the kind of speed I can get from even a 6/month vps compared to a shared service
[21:22:47] <abjorn> like my site, i have no reason to have some vps or dedi or something
[21:22:52] <abjorn> its a fuckin wp blog
[21:23:01] <abjorn> a $5 shared hosting account will do me
[21:23:05] <abjorn> sorry, $10
[21:23:11] <progrock`> abjorn: maybe.. but the xperience doesnt hurt.. and I lik ehaving cotrol over everything
[21:23:26] <abjorn> well, i mean, i have a vps, but its not for my blog
[21:23:44] <abjorn> my site's with hostgator, but my vps isnt
[21:23:53] <progrock`> hmm.. once I got one vps.. all other hostings were shut down.. had no need for them
[21:24:25] <progrock`> and actually.. my cheapest vps, on rapidxen, is my favorite
[21:24:40] <abjorn> Well, the VPS is specifically for a site I'm building, so.
[21:26:28] <imsky> vps is for srs business
[21:26:36] <imsky> not node.js running clojurescript
[21:27:00] <abjorn> lol
[21:27:03] <abjorn> 2bad
[21:27:05] <abjorn> im usin 4 node
[21:27:13] <imsky> 4 node of node?
[21:27:37] <progrock`> hahha, yeah.. i got a few vpses for node and mongo
[21:27:49] <abjorn> yeah node and mongo
[21:27:51] <abjorn> is what im running
[21:28:03] <abjorn> i switched to the mongo dark (or light, depending on your view) side
[21:28:28] <progrock`> hed, depends on your needs.. quite useful if you have no need fo a relational db
[21:28:30] <imsky> k/v stores are pretty kewel, but document store is keweler
[21:28:31] <progrock`> heh*
[21:28:42] <abjorn> it's a document store though
[21:28:46] <imsky> troll successful
[21:29:01] <abjorn> u trol u
[21:29:05] <imsky> o me
[21:29:13] <abjorn> o u
[21:29:33] <abjorn> it totes is
[21:29:35] <imsky> hmm i think it's like this
[21:29:35] <progrock`> abjorn: so, who you using for your vps?
[21:29:41] <abjorn> linode
[21:30:02] <progrock`> ahh, yeah I have one with them
[21:30:17] <progrock`> half a dozen with rackspace, and a couple with rapidxen
[21:30:20] <abjorn> I really like them, it's a very nice setup
[21:30:25] <taipres> I got lot of cheap vps's listed on my site at http://cheapvpsdeals.info/
[21:30:33] <abjorn> I may consider rackspace at some point, I have a friend who works there
[21:30:33] <progrock`> yeah, no complaints.
[21:30:36] <imsky> stage 1: new web tech comes out like mongo/node, all the early adopters get on it. stage 2: some adopters really like the tech and dedicate a couple years to it, building expertise. stage 3: new tech comes out and a bunch of early adopters jump on it. the older adopters have now made a career out of their early obsession, and see no reason to switch
[21:30:39] <taipres> from various companies, i don't get payed for it, is to help others
[21:30:54] <taipres> just posted a sick 1, 1Gbps/unmetered 10a month, 10 highest I allow
[21:30:55] <imsky> CIRCLE OF LIFE MAN
[21:30:56] <abjorn> imsky: lol yeah true
[21:30:57] <taipres> but nice specs
[21:31:24] <progrock`> taipres: heh, I'll stick with my 3... have had nothing but bad experiences outside of them
[21:31:46] <abjorn> I probably could've gotten a job a rackspace, but I would've had to commute to san antonio every day for like 6 months
[21:31:57] <abjorn> which
[21:31:58] <abjorn> no fun
[21:32:01] <abjorn> i would go mad
[21:32:07] <progrock`> I just truel love rapidxen's apoach.. 2 mbit gauranteed... your monthly fee is your monthl fee no matter what
[21:32:09] <taipres> progrock which providers, i'm always looking to add more even though i'm backed up
[21:32:22] <progrock`> taipres: rapidxen, rackspace, and linode
[21:32:49] <progrock`> abjorn: heh, I got an hour a nd a half to 2 hour commute.. need to move soo
[21:32:53] <loius541> SOPA wins :S -> http://adf.ly/50eZt
[21:33:08] <abjorn> yeah im not clicking that link
[21:33:13] <imsky> i did :'|
[21:33:19] <abjorn> gayporn?
[21:33:21] <imsky> and IM GLAD
[21:33:25] <imsky> it's a chick with huge tits
[21:33:28] <abjorn> rofl
[21:33:36] <imsky> http://imgchili.com/show/4382/4382030_1253560641833.jpg
[21:33:39] <progrock`> lol, "please ait" oh well
[21:34:01] <abjorn> To be fair, there are some edge cases where HostGator's VPS are kind of ideal. Mostly just when you need a cPanel/Plesk shared hosting kind of setup, but without restrictions like only being able to send 500 emails an hour (so, for spammers).
[21:34:18] <abjorn> dat cpanel is expensive on it's own, yo
[21:34:28] <abjorn> like, ludicrously so
[21:34:32] <progrock`> no kidding. but no need for me
[21:34:49] <progrock`> they offer free cpanel with all vpses?
[21:34:55] <abjorn> nope
[21:35:00] <abjorn> our cpanel is $10 a month
[21:35:05] <imsky> lolwat
[21:35:08] <imsky> my cpanel is $0
[21:35:08] <abjorn> plesk is free for a year, then $5 a month
[21:35:10] <progrock`> oh, ok.. plenty of places offer for $7 i believe
[21:35:13] <abjorn> yeah idk
[21:35:14] <taipres> progrock: maybe can get you to list specs too in a comment if I post those :D
[21:35:18] <taipres> little cat /proc/cpuinfo action
[21:35:19] <abjorn> we add charges on vps for a lot of things
[21:35:22] <abjorn> that we dont for dedis
[21:35:23] <imsky> i know lol
[21:35:25] <taipres> and download speed test with wget hehe
[21:35:27] <imsky> VPS is a scam
[21:35:36] <abjorn> lol
[21:35:41] <abjorn> idk about that
[21:35:48] <imsky> PAAS IS THE FUTURE
[21:35:50] <taipres> VPS not a scam
[21:35:53] <progrock`> taipres: sorry no time.. they should be wel lknown enough
[21:36:07] <progrock`> taipres: and you can always talk to the owner of rapidxen, the only non big name of the 3
[21:36:37] <taipres> yeah but problem with asking providers if they run that on their top box lol
[21:36:39] <progrock`> taipres: BTW, whats your site got on lowendbox ?  ;)
[21:36:41] <taipres> pretty bias
[21:36:54] <loius415> SOPA wins :S -> http://adf.ly/50eZt
[21:36:54] <taipres> progrock considering leb is finished, i'd say a lot
[21:36:58] <abjorn> http://cheapvpsdeals.info/jolly-works-hosting-13year-openvz-vps-128mb-in-phoenix/
[21:36:59] <abjorn> I like how this host only allows ircd and not bots
[21:37:01] <taipres> hes handing LEB off to a spammer apparently
[21:37:04] <progrock`> heh, yeah, rapidxen is very liekly not gonna pull any bs..
[21:37:13] <taipres> my sites already more useful just new and doesn't have community behind it yet
[21:37:19] <taipres> traffic pickin up though
[21:37:30] <imsky> progrock`: stop selling rapidxen
[21:37:34] <imsky> jesus christ
[21:37:38] <taipres> lot of LEB offers expired anyway and I got some exclusives to my site listed hehe
[21:37:39] <abjorn> rofl
[21:37:48] <progrock`> imsky: heh, just my preference.. in fact, they have plenty of problems... I just like them
[21:37:51] <abjorn> only im allowed to try and sell a host, cause i work for one!@
[21:38:02] <imsky> progrock`: i already have the rapidxen tab open in firefox, you're just aggravating me
[21:38:15] <imsky> RAPIDXEN IS THE BEES KNEES MAN I NEVER HEARD OF TOO MUCH MARKETING
[21:38:15] <abjorn> i stick wit mah linode
[21:38:17] <progrock`> imsky: i dont real care if I am
[21:38:36] <imsky> of course you don't
[21:39:24] <progrock`> id be much happier with rackspace if their fucking control panel wasnt so slow
[21:39:33] <loius932> SOPA wins :S -> http://adf.ly/50eZt
[21:39:45] <imsky> lol i love this guy
[21:39:46] <taipres> abjorn yeah lol, nothin I can do
[21:39:49] <imsky> he's just trying to make some money
[21:40:22] <progrock`> imsky: .000001 of a penny at a time.. would do bete rbegging for money on the sbway
[21:40:40] <imsky> yes sir
[21:40:44] <imsky> abjorn: https://jobs-razorfish.icims.com/jobs/search?ss=1&searchKeyword=&searchLocation=16753-16799-Austin&searchLocation=16753-16769-Chicago&searchCategory=&searchRadius=5&searchZip=
[21:40:55] <imsky> austin's blowin up
[21:41:00] <taipres> i'm gonna change the gray theme to a blue one, once I finish it
[21:41:05] <taipres> get a new logo probably
[21:41:27] <abjorn> iimsky: *shrug*
[21:41:56] <taipres> http://rapidxen.net prices pretty bad for what they offer
[21:42:05] <taipres> but at least it shouldn't be oversold which is good
[21:42:49] <progrock`> taipres: ehh, i've had horrible experience with any other sub 10 provider.  But, im sure some aint horrible
[21:43:06] <Tcalp> anyone see anything wrong with this  ? : $("div.testimonials").parent().height((cHeight) + 120) + 'px');
[21:43:21] <Tcalp> ohh
[21:43:23] <Tcalp> lol
[21:43:38] <abjorn> o.o
[21:43:50] <Haprog> not maching brackets
[21:44:03] <Haprog> one ) too many?
[21:44:13] <imsky> DONT REMIND ME
[21:44:21] <imsky> (NOT (REMIND ME))
[21:44:31] <abjorn> rofl
[21:44:41] <abjorn> WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE PARENTHESIS
[21:44:45] <taipres> progrock yeah there's some good ones out there
[21:44:51] <imsky> scheme is like ruby, which is why i hate it
[21:44:59] <imsky> it tries to be cute and anachronistic
[21:45:09] <imsky> (CAR '(1 2 3)) => 1
[21:45:15] <imsky> oh you mean [1,2,3][0]?
[21:45:18] <imsky> yeah car makes sense
[21:45:24] <progrock`> taipres: ive tried probably a dozen... jsut not worth the time usually.. I'l always have my miny boxes with rapidxen.. and anything big linode or rackspace
[21:45:54] <imsky> GSUB GSUB GSUB
[21:45:56] <progrock`> scheme.. soo old.. now haskell.. fun :)
[21:45:59] <taipres> progrock, sorry to hear that, but if you're happy with them, awesome :)
[21:46:00] <imsky> no.
[21:46:05] <imsky> haskell is forbidden
[21:46:07] <progrock`> taipres: very
[21:46:31] <progrock`> imsky: lol.  sadly never did anything cool with it.. though was gonna make a site with hakyll
[21:46:40] <progrock`> but we use scala in my office... best of both worlds
[21:46:42] <imsky> nobody ever has progrock`
[21:46:52] <imsky> haskell is the language programming nerds use to build street cred
[21:46:56] <progrock`> imsky: not true.. funcitonalis on the rise
[21:47:00] <imsky> yeah sure it is
[21:47:21] <imsky> call me when you land that juicy haskell contract
[21:47:26] <progrock`> strict, statically typed funcitonal languages are about as good as it gets for business logic
[21:47:43] <abjorn> lol imsky
[21:47:59] <imsky> abjorn: i'm surrounded by haskell-wielding douchebags on campus bro
[21:48:00] <abjorn> nothing but jaboscripts is good nuff for you, imsky <3
[21:48:20] <imsky> that and c
[21:48:33] <abjorn> idk
[21:48:39] <imsky> ++
[21:48:43] <abjorn> ew
[21:48:49] <imsky> you shut your whore mouth
[21:48:53] <abjorn> I WILL NOT
[21:48:54] <progrock`> imsky: well funcitonal languages were always popular in academics
[21:48:55] <imsky> iterators generators drooool
[21:49:03] <abjorn> utrol
[21:49:08] <imsky> progrock`: yeah because they don't have to deliver anything on time
[21:49:19] <imsky> their favorite languages: scheme and java
[21:49:23] <imsky> need i say more?
[21:49:25] <abjorn> lol java
[21:49:34] <progrock`> umm.. no really.. more for their link to lambda mathematics
[21:49:37] <progrock`> not*
[21:49:55] <imsky> progrock`: there are ways to make non-retarded lisps
[21:50:06] <imsky> unfortunately all these ways have bypassed academia for decades
[21:50:17] <abjorn> public const static inherit void method() const
[21:50:17] <imsky> CAR MAKES SENSE RIGHT GUYS, AND CDR TOO!
[21:50:27] <imsky> head and tail were just too constricting
[21:50:29] <abjorn> thats how i feel when looking at java
[21:50:35] <imsky> lol u nub
[21:50:43] <imsky> public static void main(String[] args){}
[21:50:45] <imsky> memory bro use it
[21:50:51] <abjorn> WHATEVER HOMO
[21:51:00] <progrock`> lol.. i accidently deleted my cdn files on rackspace.. yet they are still up, oh well
[21:51:15] <abjorn> that's probably not something you should accidentally delete
[21:51:19] <imsky> lol
[21:51:22] <imsky> academic
[21:51:25] <imsky> WHOOPS
[21:51:43] <progrock`> abjorn: not liek ti was my work stuff, lol.. jsut my personal shit.. couldnt really care
[21:51:49] <abjorn> lol I love those "i accidentally my public_html" support chats
[21:51:53] <progrock`> abjorn: just need my personal stuff up when applying for jobs, lol
[21:52:11] <imsky> C-style is good because it can map onto von neumann architectures
[21:52:19] <imsky> lisps were always the weird fruity kid at the table
[21:52:39] <abjorn> I once told a customer in chat to delete the default.html file in their public_html because it was the getting started page we add by default. And I watched as he deleted everything in his home directory.
[21:52:44] <imsky> and haskell, ml, and whatever else
[21:53:21] <progrock`> imsky: so, your a computer science major making fun of other computer science majors for being nerds?
[21:53:41] <abjorn> you'll never understand him
[21:53:44] <abjorn> like i understand him
[21:53:46] <imsky> lol
[21:53:47] <progrock`> heh
[21:53:47] <abjorn> NO ONE KNOWS HIM LIKE I DO
[21:53:58] <abjorn> it's the bond
[21:53:59] <abjorn> of
[21:54:00] <abjorn> the wiggle
[21:54:03] <imsky> progrock`: you ever get annoyed by the kid who's into cars a little too much
[21:54:15] <imsky> he knows all about DOHC and SOHC, camshafts and alternators
[21:54:27] <imsky> and acts all smug when you don't use the latest air filter or whatever
[21:54:34] <progrock`> imsky: if I did, I would simply walk away from him, lol.. and, lol.. I know a fair deal myself about cars
[21:54:41] <abjorn> I don't!
[21:54:46] <imsky> progrock`: imagine being stuck in a classroom for a few semesters with that kid
[21:54:49] <abjorn> I have no idea about anything you just said
[21:55:00] <progrock`> imsky: its collegem you can leave class antime you want
[21:55:08] <imsky> progrock`: holy shit are you trollin
[21:55:08] <progrock`> and not show up any time you want
[21:55:11] <abjorn> that would defeat the point
[21:55:12] <abjorn> of
[21:55:14] <abjorn> college
[21:55:16] <imsky> it's lecture, you have to go
[21:55:24] <imsky> did you even go to college progrock`
[21:55:27] <abjorn> >pay lots of money to take classes
[21:55:27] <abjorn> >leave classes
[21:55:29] <imsky> i think you don't know how it works
[21:55:31] <progrock`> abjorn: nah, not for me. .I just needed th epiece of paper, and a few years of guilt fre fun
[21:55:43] <imsky> lol?
[21:55:51] <abjorn> well that's
[21:55:51] <abjorn> not
[21:55:53] <abjorn> usually how it works
[21:55:54] <progrock`> imsky: lol, yeah, engineering degree to be exact
[21:55:54] <imsky> yeah that's retarded
[21:56:11] <imsky> guilt-free fun? like torturing mannequins?
[21:56:11] <imsky> wtf
[21:56:17] <progrock`> no, retarded is not having fun in college
[21:56:27] <imsky> what you said was retarded
[21:56:30] <imsky> "leave any time"
[21:56:34] <progrock`> and no job ever asked me baout GPA or anything liek that..
[21:56:38] <imsky> people in my field of study can be overbearing annoying nerds
[21:56:44] <imsky> i'm not an overbearing annoying nerd, so i find them
[21:56:47] <imsky> overbearing and annoying
[21:56:51] <abjorn> lol
[21:56:52] <progrock`> imsky: umm, i left anytime I felt liek it... its your option.
[21:57:01] <imsky> progrock`: man you're one spiffy troll
[21:57:06] <abjorn> it's an option, just not a good option
[21:57:07] <imsky> people go to graduate
[21:57:12] <progrock`> trolling the trolls, you know how it is
[21:57:14] <imsky> well..smart people
[21:57:25] <imsky> the dumbasses go into journalism and studio arts
[21:57:44] <progrock`> abjorn: depends. i dont work n the feild my degree was.. I just used it as an excuse for hwy I didnt work for the time being
[21:58:02] <abjorn> lol
[21:58:03] <abjorn> my friend
[21:58:04] <abjorn> in another chan
[21:58:07] <abjorn> (11:57:22 PM) poisonar1s: every fucking ruby project on github is fucking rails
[21:58:12] <imsky> progrock`: that's the other thing, i write software for a living. most of these haskell-loving dbags don't do anything with that knowledge
[21:58:23] <imsky> abjorn: ruby would have a 2-people user base without DHH and zed shaw
[21:58:45] <progrock`> imsky: ehh, some of the haskel lpeopel who have applid to my company were some of the best programmers.. and like i said, we use scala.. so functional if 50% of it
[21:58:45] <abjorn> rofl
[21:58:57] <imsky> progrock`: selection bias buddy, they graduated college and went to get a job
[21:59:13] <progrock`> imsky: half the developers in my company dont have degrees for that matter
[21:59:31] <imsky> a degree's not required, i'm just saying it from a college perspective
[21:59:37] <imsky> college brings like-minded people together
[21:59:43] <imsky> and what i learned is i don't want to work with nerds
[22:00:04] <progrock`> imsky: well thtas definitely somethign good to take out of school I suppose
[22:00:24] <imsky> no kidding. i think you've been out of that experience too long
[22:00:31] <imsky> the horror's just a faint memory
[22:00:36] <progrock`> heh, graduated 3 years ago.. not too long
[22:00:40] <imsky> faint memory
[22:01:03] <progrock`> but yeah, I just squeked my way through
[22:01:18] <progrock`> to much fun with the drugs and alcohol.. as well as the pussy
[22:01:55] <coldhead> too*
[22:02:03] <imsky> lol he's been misspelling things all day
[22:02:04] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[22:02:06] <progrock`> lol, thank you sir
[22:02:12] <abjorn> you pipe in for the first time in like an hour
[22:02:14] <imsky> ^ nerdery right there
[22:02:22] <progrock`> yeah, laptop keyboard is pretty bad.. plus I cant type for shit anyway
[22:02:39] <abjorn> oh, you, coldhead <3
[22:02:56] <Soopaman> anyone else poke around the enyo2 framework that was just released by hp?
[22:03:06] <imsky> IM GOOGLING IT AS WE SPEAK
[22:03:23] <imsky> webos? lolwut
[22:03:33] <imsky> i'm trying to make money here, not work on the platform equivalent of haskell
[22:03:55] <abjorn> lol
[22:03:56] <Soopaman> hey, nothing wrong with haskell
[22:04:04] <abjorn> ohboyherewegoagain.jpg
[22:04:13] <Soopaman> but take a look at the framework
[22:04:40] <progrock`> OK, on a serious note, any of you guys actually have a good IDE for primarily javascript?... been using IDEA at work, and not really liking it... going back to VIM soon.. though I do enjoy some of the IDE feaures
[22:04:46] <Soopaman> i'm kinda curious if i've lost my mind
[22:05:13] <abjorn> I just use sublime text 2, progrock`
[22:05:18] <progrock`> considering giving eclipse a shot since its got nice vim integration
[22:05:21] <abjorn> Because I am a follower so that is what I do.
[22:05:29] <Soopaman> progrock`: I'm in the same boat, rely on textwrangler and a tab open to google
[22:05:30] <abjorn> I do what the newsletters tell me to do
[22:05:40] <imsky> let (lx, rx) = B.splitAt n' x in (ByteRope $ l |- lx, ByteRope $ rx -| r)
[22:05:43] <abjorn> but no, really, sublime text is realfuckinneato
[22:05:44] <imsky> THIS IS VERY READABLE I AGREE
[22:05:47] <Soopaman> java ide's make me sad
[22:06:00] <progrock`> Soopaman: yeah, well I use it since its not half bad for scala
[22:06:02] <abjorn> you're in luck, then, sublime text is PYTHONS
[22:06:09] <progrock`> Soopaman: but for JS.. ehh.. it kind ablows
[22:06:25] <Soopaman> i still dream of the day firebug goes standalone
[22:06:27] <abjorn> god damnit, just use it
[22:06:28] <abjorn> http://www.sublimetext.com/2
[22:06:45] <progrock`> abjorn: if it has vim integration, id be sold
[22:06:45] <Soopaman> 'cause at times i swear it's the only reason i still use firefox
[22:06:46] <imsky> abjorn: i used it, wasn't that great
[22:07:07] <imsky> not a big upgrade over geany or np++
[22:07:22] <imsky> oh my god
[22:07:22] <progrock`> abjorn: nevermind, is it windows only?
[22:07:24] <imsky> l :> s -> fmap (+ getSum (measure l)) (L.reverse (B.elemIndices x s)) ++ treeEIE l
[22:07:27] <abjorn> no?
[22:07:29] <abjorn> not windows only
[22:07:35] <Soopaman> imsky: truth be told, I'm an erlang guy, but with a good framework anything is usable :P
[22:07:36] <imsky> wtf is that shit above
[22:07:38] <abjorn> if it wasn't windows only web devs wouldnt be going gaga over it
[22:07:42] <abjorn> *if it was
[22:07:45] <progrock`> oh , looked likt it was
[22:07:50] <imsky> haskell you horrible son of a bitch
[22:07:51] <imsky> l :> s -> fmap (+ getSum (measure l)) (L.reverse (B.elemIndices x s)) ++ treeEIE l
[22:08:03] <imsky> is that a pipe at the end
[22:08:07] <imsky> and at the beginning?
[22:08:20] <abjorn> lol that was what i thought
[22:08:28] <abjorn> COULD BE WORSE
[22:08:30] <abjorn> could be
[22:08:30] <imsky> abjorn: http://code.google.com/p/yi-editor/source/browse/yi/src/library/Data/ByteRope.hs
[22:08:32] <abjorn> :(){ :|:& };:
[22:08:36] <imsky> aww c fork bomb

[22:17:01] <imsky> he wrote mongrel
[22:17:10] <imsky> before mongrel, rails was 1000x as slow
[22:17:17] <imsky> but he's a c hacker so he made it go supa fast

[22:18:25] <imsky> hnnnggggggg rails is magic

[22:20:51] <imsky> rails in red

[22:21:20] <imsky> i bet $500 2 years from now node will be the dominant new hotness
[22:21:21] <abjorn> ic
[22:21:34] <imsky> we're still a ways away from enterprise hysteria
[22:21:43] <systemfault> imsky: I'm still unsure... the async model can be a bitch :/
[22:21:45] <imsky> but it's coming
[22:21:49] <imsky> systemfault: bro, compared to rails?
[22:21:55] <imsky> CUCUMBER PASSENGER NINJA DOJO
[22:22:00] <imsky> yeah fuck that shit, fuck bundler and gems
[22:22:03] <systemfault> imsky: I cannot compare, I haven't even tried rails
[22:22:48] <fulcan> I got lavalamp to finally work but now my hyperlinks don't work? if I right click and open new or new window they work, but not an 'on-self'?? I am hopelessly lost  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/540892/  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/540891/
[22:22:59] <imsky> abjorn: even more depressing
[22:23:00] <imsky> http://www.google.com/trends/?q=node.js,ruby+on+rails,+django+python&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[22:23:07] <imsky> i always knew python was a scam
[22:23:09] <imsky> but man
[22:23:31] <imsky> how humiliating is it to be outgunned by a 2 year old javascript framework
[22:23:33] <kyb> how do i make the text bigger in a <a tag
[22:23:42] <systemfault> I never seen python as a language of the web :/
[22:23:48] <imsky> reddit runs on it, systemfault
[22:23:50] <systemfault> More like the new "perl"
[22:23:53] <kyb> how is python a scam
[22:23:54] <imsky> google uses it in huge amounts too
[22:24:02] <systemfault> imsky: I know.. still :/
[22:24:10] <imsky> kyb: sold as a panacea to the php/java crappiness
[22:24:16] <imsky> DJANGOS GREAT OMG
[22:24:24] <kyb> whats django
[22:24:32] <imsky> never you mind grasshopper
[22:24:33] <kyb> well what happened
[22:25:13] <kyb> ok django is a python web framework
[22:25:21] <kyb> i mean how is it a scam
[22:25:33] <codepal> imsky, your chart is off -
[22:25:34] <codepal> http://www.google.com/trends/?q=node.js,+ruby+on+rails,+django&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[22:25:36] <imsky> it's hyperbole kyb
[22:25:45] <youngin> fuck rails

[22:25:56] <codepal> django is bd
[22:26:02] <imsky> codepal: lol you sexy bastard. yes, chris brown movies and leo dicaprio have a lot to do with web dev
[22:26:10] <imsky> GOOD JOB
[22:26:22] <youngin> i love rails though
[22:26:31] <imsky> youngin: you just said you hate it
[22:26:54] <kyb> lol
[22:27:08] <imsky> wait codepal YOUR CHART is off http://www.google.com/trends/?q=node,+rails,+django&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[22:27:19] <kyb> so its between rails nodejs and python   how bout asp.net mvc?
[22:27:29] <codepal> yeah what about!
[22:27:29] <imsky> kyb that's where the boring money is, sure
[22:28:15] <kyb> ya
[22:28:40] <imsky> asp.net mvc is about 20-25x node.js
[22:28:45] <youngin> imsky: i just like the drama hehe
[22:28:50] <kyb> what?
[22:28:52] <imsky> youngin: oh u trol
[22:28:59] <kyb> how is it 20-25x
[22:29:00] <youngin> and the makeup sex that follows

[22:29:10] <imsky> kyb: its got a 20x larger market share
[22:29:18] <kyb> how
[22:29:23] <kyb> by google trends?
[22:29:27] <joshualibrarian1> When I look at the .html() of a selected DIV object, it doesn't include the actual <div> tag with it's id and classes!  Is there a handy function that extracts the whole div?
[22:29:28] <kyb> or user base
[22:29:29] <imsky> by job openings
[22:29:45] <kyb> how bout compared to others
[22:29:48] <imsky> abjorn: wanna make a bet that ms acquires node?
[22:29:53] <imsky> or joyent for that matter
[22:30:28] <skim1776> how is it possible to make droppable divs with jquery to fix draggable items within them in a certain place?
[22:30:44] <kyb> what i wanna know is
[22:30:47] <systemfault> imsky: That would be weird...
[22:30:57] <imsky> systemfault: how? they already endorse jquery
[22:30:59] <systemfault> imsky: I don't think it's impossible though...
[22:31:06] <imsky> they get paid every time an android is sold
[22:31:10] <systemfault> imsky: How is node.js related to jquery?
[22:31:15] <systemfault> (Beside the Javascript part)
[22:31:17] <imsky> systemfault: it's jaboscript mayne
[22:31:20] <imsky> also azure runs node
[22:31:25] <imsky> clearly they want to do this
[22:31:44] <kyb> ya
[22:31:47] <systemfault> imsky: Azure running node is definitely a better argument than "they endorse jquery" :/
[22:31:48] <kyb> node js owns
[22:31:58] <imsky> systemfault: well why would they endorse jquery?
[22:32:08] <imsky> ms has invested in javascript since the 90s man
[22:32:17] <imsky> windows is essentially html + js
[22:32:22] <systemfault> imsky: lol
[22:32:22] <kyb> are u serious?
[22:32:30] <codepal> gradual decline of Microsoft =-- http://www.google.com/trends/?q=node.js,+%22ruby+on+rails%22,+%22django+python%22,+%22asp.net%22&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0
[22:32:32] <kyb> i thought it was win32
[22:32:33] <systemfault> imsky: Stop le trolling ;)
[22:32:45] <abjorn> o.o
[22:32:58] <imsky> lolol
[22:33:02] <imsky> Winkey-R
[22:33:03] <imsky> wscript
[22:33:06] <imsky> type it in nubs
[22:33:12] <systemfault> MS is just beginning to care about javascript again
[22:33:17] <imsky> windows has had native javascript since like '98
[22:33:26] <imsky> asp runs javascript too
[22:33:28] <imsky> the old asp
[22:33:32] <abjorn> *shrug* I don't think ryah would let microsoft own node if he could help it. And if he had no choice...well, he'd probably just fork it and call it something else.
[22:33:35] <systemfault> imsky: But it has always been a second grade citizen...
[22:33:38] <abjorn> I would imagine, anyways
[22:33:38] <imsky> abjorn: it's not his, it's joyent's
[22:33:43] <abjorn> I know it isn't
[22:33:46] <systemfault> imsky: VBScript was "the" interpreter
[22:33:47] <imsky> systemfault: yeah, but so what? didn't you get the JQUERY thing?
[22:34:00] <kyb> well
[22:34:03] <fulcan> I got lavalamp to finally work but now my hyperlinks don't work? if I right click and open new or new window they work, but not an 'on-self'?? I am hopelessly lost  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/540892/  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/540891/
[22:34:03] <systemfault> I couldn't care less about jquery... to be honest :/
[22:34:08] <imsky> not the point
[22:34:08] <kyb> windows 8 is gonna be javascript
[22:34:11] <imsky> kyb exactly
[22:34:12] <kyb> for sure
[22:34:18] <imsky> the new metro apps are all html5
[22:34:21] <imsky> it's not on accident
[22:34:23] <kyb> ya
[22:34:27] <imsky> they're not, like, REACTING to the market
[22:34:33] <systemfault> imsky: Well... yes it's an accident :/
[22:34:35] <imsky> it's the same active desktop shit from '98
[22:34:58] <systemfault> imsky: MS.. has their plan worked, we'd be using WPF applications...
[22:34:59] <kyb> bye bye silverlight
[22:35:09] <imsky> systemfault: wut
[22:35:10] <systemfault> and silverlight.. yes.
[22:35:32] <kyb> why didnt wpf take off?
[22:35:38] <imsky> kyb because it's like rails
[22:35:41] <imsky> proprietary and temporary
[22:35:46] <systemfault> imsky: jscript just began to be good... with ie9
[22:35:51] <skim1776> is it possible to make draggable element be dropped only into certain place within droppable area?
[22:35:52] <imsky> i can't believe you nubs don't see the strategy
[22:36:00] <imsky> js has been in COM/OLE since the old ages
[22:36:03] <kyb> rails is temp?
[22:36:07] <imsky> you could string together windows shit with js...
[22:36:13] <imsky> that's more than you can do in osx or linux
[22:36:13] <donCams> hi. can anybody recommend a jquery plugin for uploading files like in facebook?
[22:36:22] <imsky> kyb: what future do you see for it?
[22:36:30] <kyb> idk rails
[22:36:37] <kyb> i code in asp.net mvc actually
[22:36:50] <kyb> but i thought rails was suppose to b good
[22:36:55] <imsky> lol keep dreaming
[22:37:05] <kyb> whats wrong with it
[22:37:09] <imsky> plz restart your server when you make a change sir
[22:37:22] <kyb> sreious?
[22:37:37] <kyb> u got to restart the server?
[22:37:38] <imsky> lol
[22:38:10] <systemfault> imsky: You're weird... your words seems to be a mix of lulz/trolling/facts
[22:38:35] <imsky> nah you just don't want to admit that ms has a stake in this js thing
[22:38:52] <imsky> apple has no stake, google has a huge stake
[22:38:59] <abjorn> ? what, of course they do, they have from the beginning, it's a fact of browser history
[22:39:01] <bot-t> abjorn, #7535 (Firefox Console error: Unexpected token in attribute selector ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7535
[22:39:06] <imsky> abjorn: inorite
[22:39:08] <abjorn> lol
[22:39:10] <skim1776> does anyone know how to make draggable element drop only into certain divs?
[22:39:11] <abjorn> bot-t lol
[22:39:12] <systemfault> imsky: MS never cared about the web(since IE4), that was their problem.
[22:39:25] <imsky> systemfault: since ie6 good sir, and because they won the browser wars
[22:39:37] <imsky> ms invented ajax...jesus christ mayne
[22:39:43] <abjorn> They had a stake in it early on in the sense that they wanted to own it before killing it off.
[22:39:45] <systemfault> imsky: It was an accident.
[22:39:55] <imsky> yes yes, everything good ms ever did is an accident
[22:40:00] <abjorn> allowing js to create http requests is an accident?
[22:40:02] <systemfault> imsky: And it wasn't meant to be "something standard"
[22:40:13] <imsky> systemfault: i think you're old enough to remember the browser wars
[22:40:18] <abjorn> not only to make http requests, but async http reuests?
[22:40:19] <imsky> standard = whatever netscape/ms did first
[22:40:24] <abjorn> doesn't sound like an accident to me
[22:40:26] <imsky> there was no standard
[22:41:01] <imsky> same with webkit and today's browsers too
[22:41:07] <systemfault> abjorn: Well, you had to initialize some proprietary component to access it. I don't think MS wanted devs to use it the way we do nowadays.
[22:41:32] <systemfault> And XHR arrived later in other browsers.
[22:41:36] <imsky> yeah, outlook web access was so secret
[22:42:16] <imsky> google made it big, ms invented it, firefox patched it in
[22:42:24] <imsky> that's the whole story brother
[22:42:28] <systemfault> It wasn't digg?
[22:42:31] <imsky> digg?
[22:42:34] <imsky> lolwat
[22:43:18] <theBrettman> does anyone agree they should change the name of javascript to C Script?
[22:43:21] <kyb> ya man
[22:43:28] <kyb> digg used ajax
[22:43:28] <imsky> no, it already has a generic name
[22:43:42] <theBrettman> but it has more to do with C than Java
[22:43:49] <systemfault> javascript is ugly.... ecmascript is even worse.
[22:43:53] <theBrettman> in fact, it has nothing to do with Java
[22:44:10] <kyb> how does it have anything to do with c
[22:44:10] <systemfault> theBrettman: It has instanceof :P
[22:44:12] <imsky> kyb : digg was launched in '04, gmail came out a full half-year before it
[22:44:17] <theBrettman> well they use C to do everything with java
[22:44:19] <imsky> owa was in 2000
[22:44:29] <abjorn> javascript has nothing to do with C or Java, so it's a moot point
[22:44:31] <theBrettman> oops, I mean with javascript
[22:44:42] <theBrettman> abjorn, what r u talking about?
[22:44:55] <theBrettman> javascript can't run without an engine
[22:44:58] <abjorn> It has curly brackets, that's about it.
[22:45:01] <theBrettman> engines written in C
[22:45:02] <kyb> lol
[22:45:06] <kyb> so what
[22:45:06] <abjorn> Yeah, but you could write that in anything
[22:45:08] <theBrettman> what do you think interprets it?
[22:45:10] <imsky> this turned retarded really fast
[22:45:11] <abjorn> That doesn't make the language related to C
[22:45:19] <kyb> ya
[22:45:23] <kyb> abjorn is right
[22:45:30] <kyb> u can write the interpreter in javascript
[22:45:33] <kyb> if u want
[22:45:34] <abjorn> ^
[22:45:36] <kyb> or java
[22:45:38] <theBrettman> all languages are pretty much based from c tho
[22:45:41] <theBrettman> even java
[22:45:44] <abjorn> ...
[22:45:45] <kyb> no
[22:45:49] <abjorn> uhm
[22:45:50] <kyb> fortran isnt
[22:45:50] <abjorn> no
[22:45:51] <abjorn> not really
[22:45:51] <systemfault> omh...
[22:45:52] <theBrettman> well not all
[22:45:57] <systemfault> That discussion...
[22:46:01] <theBrettman> but more than 90%
[22:46:05] <abjorn> nope
[22:46:08] <kyb> neither is lisp
[22:46:12] <kyb> or xml
[22:46:21] <theBrettman> xml is not a language
[22:46:24] <theBrettman> it's a markup
[22:46:25] <abjorn> well lets not get into non-programming languages, kyb
[22:46:32] <abjorn> it's a language, just not a programming language
[22:46:46] <kyb> is lisp a programming langauge?
[22:46:50] <theBrettman> yes
[22:46:51] <systemfault> yes
[22:46:54] <theBrettman> lisp is awesome
[22:46:54] <kyb> its the same category as xml
[22:46:57] <imsky> i love me some trols
[22:47:02] <abjorn> wait
[22:47:02] <abjorn> what
[22:47:06] <kyb> yes
[22:47:08] <systemfault> lol
[22:47:08] <abjorn> lisp, same category as xml, what
[22:47:10] <abjorn> WHAT
[22:47:12] <abjorn> GET OUT
[22:47:12] <kyb> it is
[22:47:13] <theBrettman> rofl
[22:47:15] <abjorn> GET OUT
[22:47:26] <kyb> look at the comaprison of lisp to json to xml
[22:47:28] <abjorn> I will not take this level of trolling in my #jquery
[22:47:31] <systemfault> Then JSON is a programming language :/
[22:47:33] <imsky> abjorn: i concur
[22:47:33] <systemfault> lol
[22:47:34] <abjorn> I shall not accept it
[22:47:40] <kyb> look it up
[22:47:43] <imsky> you can't compile xml into .exe
[22:47:45] <abjorn> I don't need to
[22:47:47] <imsky> therefore xml is not like lisp
[22:47:49] <kyb> its called functional language
[22:47:54] <imsky> BULLETPROOF LOGIC
[22:48:03] <kyb> um no
[22:48:06] <theBrettman> xml does nothing, it is just markup
[22:48:17] <theBrettman> real code handles the markup
[22:48:29] <kyb> http://quoderat.megginson.com/2007/01/03/all-markup-ends-up-looking-like-xml/
[22:48:31] <systemfault> XSLT is already closer to a programming language :)
[22:48:31] <kyb> read that
[22:48:43] <kyb> lisp is markup
[22:48:47] <abjorn> no
[22:48:48] <abjorn> no
[22:48:48] <theBrettman> so is there a javascript not made from c?
[22:48:49] <abjorn> no it isn't
[22:48:57] <theBrettman> lisp is not markup
[22:48:58] <abjorn> you're so fundamentally wrong it's not even funny
[22:49:19] <theBrettman> go learn it, it won't take long
[22:49:25] <theBrettman> can learn it faster than css
[22:49:26] <abjorn> theBrettman: Yes there is, there's Rhino, for one.
[22:49:30] <theBrettman> ahhh
[22:49:34] <kyb> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LispVsXml
[22:49:36] <theBrettman> I dint kno that
[22:50:01] <theBrettman> I wonder y they called it lisp instead of list?
[22:50:02] <systemfault> And I don't know any javascript interpreter written in C.
[22:50:04] <imsky> i just killed your argument
[22:50:05] <imsky> http://progmatism.com/software/kamen/
[22:50:11] <systemfault> They're all written in C++ :/
[22:50:20] <imsky> systemfault: not all you mangina
[22:50:29] <abjorn> mangina lol
[22:50:34] <theBrettman> c is short for c++ lol. it's easier than reaching with meh pinky!
[22:50:42] <imsky> oh wow
[22:50:46] <abjorn> what
[22:50:47] <abjorn> no
[22:50:47] <imsky> breathtaking trolability
[22:50:51] <abjorn> C is a different language
[22:50:54] <cyberRodent> I feel compelled to add this link http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html
[22:50:59] <systemfault> Oh shit.. the trolling level is over nine-thousand.
[22:51:13] <imsky> it's 9000e9000
[22:51:15] <theBrettman> I know C is not object oriented
[22:51:25] <theBrettman> unless it's objective C which isn't C either, lol
[22:51:26] <abjorn> well okay, at least you understand they are different
[22:51:51] <theBrettman> is AT&T even responsible for Objective C?
[22:51:59] <abjorn> don't know, don't care
[22:52:04] <abjorn> no one cares about obj-c
[22:52:14] <systemfault> theBrettman: I thin it was the NeXT guys who invented it.
[22:52:31] <systemfault> Hmm... people programming apple crap do care about Objective-C
[22:52:38] <theBrettman> I wonder how they got away with that?
[22:52:39] <abjorn> no
[22:52:44] <abjorn> it wasn't created by next
[22:52:49] <imsky> yes it was
[22:52:51] <imsky> yes it was
[22:52:51] <abjorn> it predates that quite a bit
[22:52:59] <theBrettman> it was smalltalk I think
[22:53:01] <imsky> we have always been at war with eurasia
[22:53:33] <theBrettman> idk
[22:53:35] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C
[22:53:35] <abjorn> "Objective-C was created primarily byÂ Brad CoxÂ and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their companyÂ Stepstone."

[22:54:12] <abjorn> nope too busy listening to puscifer
[22:54:22] <imsky> indigo children indigo children
[22:54:25] <abjorn> lol
[22:54:33] <abjorn> nosir
[22:54:35] <abjorn> The Undertaker
[22:54:41] <theBrettman> eww, it starts with a rainbow
[22:54:43] <theBrettman> puke
[22:54:50] <imsky> uhh
[22:54:53] <abjorn> I've found recently that Puscifer is...like, really, really popular at my work.
[22:54:53] <imsky> you better be like
[22:54:56] <imsky> 14 years old
[22:55:07] <imsky> otherwise i'll drive to wherever you are and slap the shit out of you
[22:55:27] <imsky> "Alonzo Church also invents every language that will ever be but does it better. His lambda calculus is ignored because it is insufficiently C-like. This criticism occurs in spite of the fact that C has not yet been invented."
[22:55:29] <imsky> qft
[22:55:38] <theBrettman> oh no, reggae!
[22:55:44] <imsky> "If C didn't exist, it would need to be invented." --Voltaire
[22:55:50] <muzone> youngin: cool stuff man
[22:55:50] <theBrettman> nagging repitition
[22:56:05] <muzone> theBrettman: nagging repetition?
[22:56:12] <imsky> nagging repetition
[22:56:15] <theBrettman> yep
[22:56:20] <muzone> reggae music is nagging repetition?
[22:56:27] <imsky> i thought it was nagging repetition
[22:56:45] <theBrettman> makes me wanna hit something
[22:56:48] <theBrettman> everyone else on earth likes it
[22:56:52] <youngin> muzone: whities man, fuck it :-)
[22:57:07] <youngin> they are only sensitive to light, not to sound
[22:57:19] <youngin> which explains why most of their music sucks
[22:57:28] <imsky> abjorn: it really is a testament to history that dmr died before his language did
[22:57:34] <theBrettman> I like music with feeling
[22:57:35] <youngin> and all this hating on the music of colored folks
[22:57:46] <youngin> just goes to show that they can't really feel the music in the first place
[22:57:54] <youngin> it's like trying to teach a new language to a child
[22:57:59] <imsky> plz sirs
[22:58:03] <imsky> #web is ---> that way
[22:58:03] <muzone> hehe
[22:58:10] <muzone> youngin: good point
[22:58:13] <theBrettman> some r n b is ok
[22:58:28] <muzone> youngin: kinda like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin_theory yeah? (if you exclude all the racist mumbo-jumbo)
[22:58:37] <muzone> theBrettman: where is your music? the music you made yourself?
[22:58:47] <theBrettman> the only bob marley song I like is the guns n roses version, lol
[22:58:52] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[22:58:58] <abjorn> imsky: true nuff
[22:58:59] <muzone> if you're gonna hate on music you probably know nothing about, at least show us your own music so we got something to judge you by
[22:59:02] <theBrettman> oh, I have recorded my music but it's not online or anything
[22:59:11] <abjorn> imsky: I have mad respect for C, I do not have mad respect for C++
[22:59:16] <youngin> well put it up!
[22:59:24] <imsky> abjorn: you will when you have to CONCATENATE STRINGS
[22:59:34] <theBrettman> I don't have complete songs, they either have lyrics no music, or music no lyrics
[22:59:39] <abjorn> lol
[22:59:40] <abjorn> well
[22:59:43] <abjorn> there's that
[22:59:44] <imsky> don't forget the null byte fml
[22:59:44] <Jonno_FTW> I have a table of rows with input elements that are <input> and <select>, how do I select all the <td> with :input ?
[22:59:47] <theBrettman> what abjorn?
[22:59:53] <abjorn> ?
[22:59:54] <theBrettman> what's wrong with objects?
[22:59:59] <imsky> wut
[23:00:01] <abjorn> Absolutely nothing.
[23:00:06] <systemfault> Loving C is pure fetischism...
[23:00:07] <imsky> say it again huh
[23:00:16] <imsky> systemfault: that's why i set my sights on c++
[23:00:18] <theBrettman> so y u don't have respect for the ++?
[23:00:28] <youngin> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[23:00:32] * youngin is now playing: Roots Rock Reggae - Inside the Jamaican music scene (1977): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Z1Ln-cDnY
[23:00:41] <imsky> */IGNOOOOOORE*
[23:00:42] <theBrettman> c and c++ both created by at&t
[23:00:42] <Jonno_FTW> I thought this was a jquery discussion channel :S
[23:00:52] <systemfault> C++ could be simpler... but is overall a better tool to tackle complexity
[23:00:57] <muzone> ooh nice youngin
[23:00:58] <theBrettman> yes, jquery's deep roots, lol
[23:01:04] <imsky> deepest
[23:01:30] <muzone> youngin: check it out new since we last spoke http://home.no/mritz/mrender1.mp3
[23:01:36] <abjorn> theBrettman: What's wrong with C++ is that it essentially tacked on Object Oriented features onto a language not designed for it, creating a mix of nonorthogonal features and language design which makes for a rather unpleasant development experience when used in a sufficiently complex program.
[23:01:51] <abjorn> I realize that was a mouthful.
[23:01:55] <systemfault> Hmm
[23:01:59] <theBrettman> ah
[23:02:02] <systemfault> abjorn: s/C++/PHP
[23:02:02] <abjorn> It's my way of saying: shits wack, yo
[23:02:04] <youngin> muzone: solid, real solid
[23:02:06] <abjorn> rofl
[23:02:08] <imsky> abjorn: and v8 is written in it
[23:02:09] <imsky> ULTIMATE TROL
[23:02:17] <theBrettman> is erlang a compiled language?
[23:02:21] <abjorn> systemfault: When I was typing that I was going to put "What's wrong with C++ and PHP"
[23:02:24] <abjorn> but decided not to
[23:02:28] <systemfault> abjorn: :P
[23:02:54] <imsky> c++ is pretty kewel actually
[23:03:02] <imsky> you playa hatas betta not playa hate
[23:03:15] <theBrettman> funny thing is opera's engine pwns v8
[23:03:19] <systemfault> imsky: I'm still reading that looonnnng Zed rant, it's cool
[23:03:27] <theBrettman> but opera isn't as functional as chrome
[23:03:27] <imsky> systemfault: you can see why he got famous
[23:03:31] <abjorn> It was cool until other languages came around that do it's job better. Everyone always laughs at me when I say this, but I think Go does object oriented systems programming a whole lot better.
[23:03:32] <systemfault> theBrettman: JScript too
[23:03:44] <abjorn> No one ever takes me seriously when I mention Go :(
[23:03:58] <theBrettman> what's a Go?
[23:04:02] <systemfault> abjorn: Nobody cares about go... just google and you :/
[23:04:08] <abjorn> http://golang.org/
[23:04:16] <abjorn> I know, I don't know why ;-; it's a very nice language
[23:04:26] <abjorn> no one ever wants to try it
[23:04:28] <imsky> because C already exists and D is better
[23:04:43] <theBrettman> never checked out D, just chuckle when I hear the name
[23:04:46] <abjorn> psh, neither of those have the actor model built in
[23:04:51] <imsky> lolwut
[23:04:56] <systemfault> D is cool but will probably never be popular.
[23:05:01] <imsky> just like go
[23:05:02] <systemfault> Because C++ is "good enough"
[23:05:15] <imsky> and better
[23:05:38] <theBrettman> where's ruby fit in to all this?
[23:05:43] <imsky> lol
[23:05:44] <theBrettman> I thought it was the fastest?
[23:05:50] <imsky> the trol is getting brave
[23:06:16] <theBrettman> or as they say "rapid prototyping"
[23:06:20] <systemfault> Ruby seems like a nice language :/
[23:06:31] <imsky> systemfault: quick, how do you replace text in ruby?
[23:06:39] <theBrettman> ruby likes script.aculo.us
[23:06:45] <systemfault> imsky: I said.. "seems"
[23:06:51] <imsky> hnnnggggglol
[23:06:56] <theBrettman> script.aculo.us = wanna be jquery
[23:07:09] <imsky> 5.times.the.memory.usage.
[23:07:19] <abjorn> ruby's a nice language, just not...you know..."efficient" with resources
[23:07:21] <theBrettman> and their pages r broken
[23:07:26] <theBrettman> try the tabs demo, lol
[23:07:33] <systemfault> Owww come on...
[23:07:45] <systemfault> I think that jQuery sucked bad at 1.4
[23:08:01] <systemfault> It improved a lot during the last year
[23:08:10] <systemfault> Cleaner API
[23:08:16] <theBrettman> cuz everyone likes it better than prototype
[23:08:37] <abjorn> er, i wouldn't say script.aculo.us is a jquery wannabe
[23:08:40] <theBrettman> whatever happened to yui?
[23:08:41] <abjorn> considering it was released first
[23:09:03] <systemfault> If it wasn't of the jQuery ecosystem, I would probably use YUI3
[23:09:07] <systemfault> Way cleaner.
[23:09:15] <systemfault> And easier to write plugins.
[23:09:16] <theBrettman> yeah, I think ur right... which is not a good thing
[23:09:19] <theBrettman> but some of their latest features copied jquery
[23:09:47] <theBrettman> yeah, yui is easier with the json too but yui can also use jquery
[23:10:10] <Cork> abjorn: script.aculo.us is the same as prototype, a collection of small scripts thrown togeather
[23:10:28] <abjorn> another reason I wouldn't call it a jquery wannabe
[23:10:29] <theBrettman> I still haven't checked out mootools. I used to wanna get into dojo toolkit
[23:10:33] <abjorn> doesn't have the same scope
[23:10:36] <Cork> abjorn: they wheren't built as a framework, and thats why they have so many inconsitencies and problems
[23:11:07] <abjorn> systemfault: Personally, if there was no jQuery I think I'd probably use dojo
[23:11:22] <imsky> heretic
[23:11:25] <systemfault> abjorn: That's the only lib I haven't tried :/
[23:11:30] <systemfault> ... yet
[23:11:57] <theBrettman> it used to be the biggest but idk how it's development is going now
[23:12:14] <theBrettman> and spry is a good joke to tell anytime
[23:13:04] <theBrettman> abjorn, y does that tutorial have chinese characters?
[23:13:27] <abjorn> systemfault: It's one definitely worth checking out
[23:13:41] <abjorn> you'll come back to jQuery, obviously, because it's more fun to use, but it's still nice
[23:14:21] <theBrettman> and jquery is simple
[23:14:32] <theBrettman> jquery ui on the otherhand...
[23:14:47] <theBrettman> I almost think they shoulda called it something else without the jquery name...
[23:14:48] <systemfault> jQueryUI is just bad...
[23:15:10] <theBrettman> not jquery's fault
[23:15:15] <systemfault> I know..
[23:15:33] <theBrettman> maybe githubs fault? lol
[23:15:49] <systemfault> The devs fault?
[23:16:13] <theBrettman> github error code: sorry, your code is to retarded to enter the repository.
[23:17:23] <theBrettman> nothing is as bad as wordpress plugin developers tho
[23:17:33] <theBrettman> they don't know what objects are
[23:17:48] <systemfault> Well... Wordpress is PHP
[23:17:53] <imsky> abjorn: i'm computing quotients and remainders using euclid's algorithms
[23:17:57] <theBrettman> yeah, php does classes
[23:18:00] <systemfault> I don't expect most PHP programmers to know programming.
[23:18:11] <theBrettman> they're just wannabe php programmers
[23:18:15] <imsky> abjorn: it's more exciting than this irc bitchfest
[23:18:18] <systemfault> That's why they're called "PHP Programmers" and not "Programmers"
[23:18:40] <JesperA> systemfault is there anything you dont hate on?
[23:18:46] <systemfault> JesperA: Sure!
[23:19:03] <systemfault> Javascript, jQuery, C++, Java, C#, Haskell, my job, my wife
[23:19:05] <abjorn> imsky: lol im still reading that rails is a ghetto thing
[23:19:10] <abjorn> i should be in bed tbh
[23:19:16] <imsky> can't believe you've never read it
[23:19:49] <Eviltwin> You don't hate on C#?
[23:19:52] <Eviltwin> What's wrong with you?
[23:19:58] <systemfault> No, wonderful language.
[23:19:58] <Jonno_FTW> wow
[23:20:11] <Jonno_FTW> since when was I in #language_wars
[23:20:17] <imsky> lol php hate is obsolete
[23:20:23] <systemfault> Probably the cleanest C-family language.
[23:20:28] <systemfault> imsky: It can't be...
[23:20:39] <imsky> systemfault: check your php version by running php -i
[23:20:46] <Eviltwin> C is the cleanest C-family language
[23:20:49] <imsky> if it says 5.3.*, hate is obsolete
[23:20:50] <theBrettman> C# is VB in disquise
[23:21:07] <systemfault> imsky: meh..
[23:21:21] <theBrettman> honestly, both of them r just .net
[23:21:30] <rgr> C# is a complete mongrel. Confused as to what it is.
[23:21:46] <NivenHuH> why would "some string" instanceof String  yield false, but  "some string".constructor == String yield true?
[23:21:50] <systemfault> rgr: If you want to see a mongrel.. see Scala.
[23:21:56] <systemfault> C# is damn clean.
[23:22:16] <systemfault> Even a MS-hater should be able to recognize that.
[23:22:49] <theBrettman> I'm curious to check out erlang
[23:22:56] <systemfault> NivenHuH: Javascript has primitive types :/
[23:23:05] <Eviltwin> "It has no global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes."
[23:23:09] <Eviltwin> Alredy sounding bad
[23:23:49] <theBrettman> prolly cuz non-blocking style?
[23:24:27] <Eviltwin> "Managed memory cannot be explicitly freed"
[23:24:30] <Eviltwin> Also sounding bad :P
[23:24:41] <theBrettman> yuck
[23:24:57] <systemfault> Can't see the problem...
[23:25:05] <systemfault> Most languages have GCs nowadays..
[23:25:39] <imsky> except for
[23:25:41] <Eviltwin> Doesn't mean they don't have an explicit free or that GC is a good thing
[23:25:43] <imsky> the fastest one
[23:25:46] <imsky> (s)
[23:26:38] <systemfault> Java is ultra-fast.. you never need to play with the GC..
[23:26:52] <Eviltwin> "Java is ultra-fast"
[23:26:55] <Eviltwin> There's your problem
[23:27:09] <imsky> java -server maybe
[23:27:11] <rgr> Most languages have gcs??? Since when. They encourage crap lazy programmers IMO.
[23:27:11] <abjorn> night ya'll
[23:27:16] <imsky> lata abjorn
[23:27:27] <theBrettman> gn
[23:29:32] <codepal> what's that widget / plugin that warns people they're using an oldish browser?
[23:30:19] <JesperA> http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jquery+old+browser+warning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
[23:31:10] <theBrettman> we should petition against IE
[23:31:15] <theBrettman> y hasn't that happened yet?
[23:31:23] <rgr> Why?
[23:31:24] <theBrettman> all developers hate IE
[23:31:33] <rgr> No they don't
[23:31:39] <theBrettman> jquery makes it easier but still
[23:31:41] <systemfault> I don't really hate IE >= 8
[23:31:45] <rgr> They hate old ie
[23:32:00] <rgr> In cowboy days.
[23:32:05] <theBrettman> well, I don't hate them as much now that they finally support inline-block but still...
[23:32:18] <rgr> That's life.
[23:32:23] <codepal> we should petition server upgrades from php 5.2 too...
[23:32:26] <systemfault> I pretty much never use inline-block :#
[23:32:28] <systemfault> :/
[23:32:32] <mindis|wurk> i hate all IE. just right now i'm looking at scrollbar appearing in chrome and FF but not in IE ;)
[23:32:44] <theBrettman> cuz ur used to using float or inline
[23:32:45] <theBrettman> lol
[23:32:49] <rgr> Then hate Mozilla too
[23:32:53] <theBrettman> float is abused whore
[23:33:11] <theBrettman> mozilla has crap javascript engine
[23:33:14] <systemfault> theBrettman: That's it baby.... but it works :)
[23:33:15] <JesperA> <!--[if IE 6]>
[23:33:15] <JesperA> <<![endif]-->
[23:33:24] <systemfault> theBrettman: Hmm, the second best?
[23:33:33] <JesperA> eftewer
[23:33:45] <theBrettman> v8 is 2nd
[23:33:55] <theBrettman> I forget what opera's is called. it's smoking fast
[23:33:55] <systemfault> theBrettman: What is first then?
[23:33:58] <JesperA> so much hate here today :S
[23:34:02] <systemfault> theBrettman: Since when?
[23:34:15] <theBrettman> if they could just join google, I would be happy
[23:34:25] <theBrettman> wow, go dl O
[23:34:27] <systemfault> Anyway... even if opera's engine was 10 times faster than chrome's.... nobody would still using it :)
[23:34:31] <theBrettman> it's screamin fast
[23:34:40] <theBrettman> it's too but they lack the features of chrome
[23:34:46] <theBrettman> so i still prefer chrome
[23:35:37] <theBrettman> I think cuz they keep spending their efforts making new js engines cuz this is like the third one in the last year or two
[23:36:17] <theBrettman> but benchmark their engine. big difference!
[23:37:19] <theBrettman> maybe it's been a few more yrs than that but still... I guess carakan came out in '08
[23:37:34] <theBrettman> before that was futhark
[23:37:43] <codepal> is browser-update.org safe to use on my site?
[23:37:56] <codepal> anybody here use it?
[23:38:13] <theBrettman> why would u?
[23:38:24] <theBrettman> I don't think there's anyone out there using old browsers
[23:38:28] <theBrettman> if they do, screw em
[23:38:35] <theBrettman> they'll update pretty quick
[23:38:41] <theBrettman> no one supports that old stuff with their code
[23:39:11] <systemfault> Well... we're still stuck supporting IE7 and up
[23:39:29] <theBrettman> meh, windows updates... I already stopped supporting IE7
[23:39:54] <theBrettman> ppl that don't know what their doing find windows updates entertaining
[23:39:55] <systemfault> IE7 isn't that difficult to support
[23:40:07] <theBrettman> is too
[23:40:08] <theBrettman> lol
[23:40:33] <theBrettman> no inline block
[23:40:33] <theBrettman> I <3 inline-block
[23:40:42] <systemfault> Well..it kind of does...
[23:41:01] <theBrettman> inline-block pwns floating and positioning
[23:41:14] <theBrettman> and can still be floated and positioned
[23:41:24] <systemfault> Meh...
[23:41:40] <systemfault> inline-block always means "spacing problems"
[23:41:50] <Eviltwin> inline-block can do the same thing as float and a clearfix
[23:42:12] <theBrettman> yes but much less painful
[23:42:19] <systemfault> I prefer to use floats without the clearfix.
[23:42:26] <Eviltwin> And vertical-align
[23:42:39] <theBrettman> especially when it's a pain to throw a class on stuff in wordpress
[23:42:56] <theBrettman> either hardcode, with a filter, or with jquery
[23:43:17] <theBrettman> systemfault, is that a joke?
[23:43:25] <systemfault> Why would I joke?
[23:43:36] <systemfault> I don't joke at 2h45 am :/
[23:43:37] <theBrettman> collapsed elements much?
[23:43:49] <systemfault> theBrettman: create a new BFC... much?
[23:43:59] <theBrettman> what's a bfc?
[23:44:05] <systemfault> Most of the time using overflow:hidden
[23:44:10] <systemfault> Box Formatting Context.
[23:44:23] <systemfault> A BFC contain floats
[23:44:24] <theBrettman> sounds like a pain
[23:44:44] <systemfault> Usually, it only means to add "overflow: hidden" to the parent
[23:45:01] <theBrettman> just as bad as clearfix
[23:45:09] <systemfault> Can't see how.
[23:45:28] <theBrettman> well not really cuz u can do it in css and don't have to add a class to an element
[23:45:54] <systemfault> I want my markup to stay clean.
[23:45:59] <theBrettman> then again, u don't have to add a class to an element either way... just means more css code
[23:46:27] <theBrettman> you guys know anything about json2.js?
[23:46:33] <systemfault> theBrettman: Why?
[23:46:49] <systemfault> It's crockford's JSON parser/stringifier
[23:47:04] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: What about it?
[23:47:13] <theBrettman> sounds really interesting
[23:47:19] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[23:47:22] <systemfault> :/
[23:47:25] <systemfault> Wow.
[23:47:29] <theBrettman> if it does what i think it does, it's going to change the word, again
[23:47:32] <systemfault> json2.js is interesting :/
[23:47:33] <theBrettman> *world
[23:47:40] <theBrettman> the cycle part
[23:47:53] <theBrettman> cuz I was thinking of using json for like everything
[23:48:07] <systemfault> Hmm everyone do that already? :/
[23:48:20] <theBrettman> and I wonder if it could make my json more dynamic for grabbing page content
[23:48:27] <mindis|wurk> grrr. how do i replicate overflow-y: auto; behavior from FF and chrome in IE?
[23:48:27] <theBrettman> idk how to explain what I mean
[23:48:58] <theBrettman> ohwell, I should find an example
[23:50:28] <DEADB33F> If I have an element with a class attribute of "selected id-457sad link", is there an easy way to get the id value from the prefixed classname, or is it a case of doing a regex match?
[23:51:04] <theBrettman> not finding any examples for recycle and retrocycle :(
[23:51:06] <Eviltwin> DEADB33F: regexes is the answer
[23:51:42] <systemfault> theBrettman: :P
[23:51:48] <DEADB33F> Though so, wasn't sure if jQuery had some fancy way of handling prefexed classes though.
[23:52:08] <theBrettman> that is the fancy way, lol
[23:52:13] <Eviltwin> DEADB33F: Classes aren't supposed to be used that way anyway
[23:52:27] <theBrettman> good point
[23:52:36] <Eviltwin> jQuery tries not to encourage bad practices
[23:52:53] <DEADB33F> yeah I know, am making a userscript though, so have no control over how the classes are used.
[23:53:12] <Eviltwin> Like I said
[23:53:14] <theBrettman> more efficient coders = less buggy plugins
[23:53:22] <Eviltwin> Regardless of how much it's not your fault that it's set up that way
[23:53:23] <theBrettman> good reusable code
[23:53:28] <Eviltwin> jQuery's not going to make it easier for you to do bad things
[23:53:58] <theBrettman> I still avoid reg exp like the plague
[23:54:04] <Eviltwin> ...why?
[23:54:07] <systemfault> Same :P
[23:54:09] <mindis|wurk> nice IE. overflow-y: scroll; works for one div but not for another
[23:54:19] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Because they're unreable...
[23:54:23] <systemfault> unreadable
[23:54:24] <theBrettman> never really used em so I don't know them very well
[23:54:37] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Sounds like you just don't know how to read them
[23:54:39] <theBrettman> I should learn it sometime
[23:54:48] <theBrettman> pretty much, lol
[23:55:12] <theBrettman> maybe it's a good thing cuz I might abuse it, lol
[23:55:21] <theBrettman> like a php programmer
[23:55:50] <Eviltwin> The unreadable ones I see are usually when people are trying to match a non-regular language
[23:55:58] <theBrettman> php programmer thinks reusable code means he can copy/paste it, lol
[23:56:03] <Eviltwin> Which they aren't designed to do
[23:56:14] <systemfault> theBrettman: I wish you were joking...
[23:56:26] <Eviltwin> But I've yet to see a "better" or more efficient solution
[23:56:29] <theBrettman> or if ur doing something really low lvl
[23:56:50] <theBrettman> classes that php has that php programmers r scared of
[23:57:22] <theBrettman> namespaces r beautiful
[23:57:34] <systemfault> Well...
[23:57:37] <systemfault> The concept, yes.
[23:57:43] <systemfault> How PHP implemented them... no
[23:58:19] <theBrettman> yeah, I shoulda wasted my php learning on perl instead
[23:58:31] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:58:40] <Eviltwin> Much more useful language
[23:58:53] <theBrettman> javascript pwns perl now tho
[23:59:03] <Eviltwin> You don't know Perl
[23:59:32] <systemfault> Any language using the dollar sign is repulsive to me :/
[23:59:44] <Eviltwin> I see
[23:59:46] <theBrettman> BASIC? lol
[23:59:53] <systemfault> theBrettman: Right ;)
[23:59:55] <theBrettman> $ is string
[23:59:57] <Eviltwin> You're one of those people who picks langauges by the minor syntactic details
