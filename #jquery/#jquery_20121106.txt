[00:00:20] <Cork> ok that makes that peas of code more understandable
[00:01:04] <Cork> swe_ET: ok, if you want to store that object for later use use .data('myPlugin', new MyPlugin())
[00:01:27] <Cork> that way you can access it the next time its called through the interface
[00:05:48] <Cork> swe_ET: you also want to do something like this http://pastebin.com/UgtjGuvc
[00:07:07] <anli> Strange, I get a warning about "duplicate declaration" if I declare a variable both in an if block and in the else block
[00:07:25] <anli> (resharper in visual studio warns about that)
[00:07:40] <Cork> jslint?
[00:07:48] <Cork> ah
[00:08:01] <ravenzz> Cork I am converting a select into an ul, would you set the select value each time a new option is selected (specially in the case of multiple selects) OR change the select's value on submit?
[00:08:10] <Cork> anli: ya, they only statically analyze it
[00:08:13] <tw2113> do var variablename once
[00:08:24] <tw2113> and then just assign as necessary
[00:08:32] <ravenzz> what is the best solution in terms of performance?
[00:08:34] <Cork> anli: and as the two variables are defined in the same scope you get the warning
[00:08:34] <ravenzz> s
[00:08:36] <faraway> anli: scopes are per function not like other languages where it is per block
[00:09:03] <anli> Hm, I did not realize that
[00:09:07] <anli> But now when you say it
[00:09:48] <Cork> ravenzz: you mean like a "value" on the ul element?
[00:10:21] <qdest> Hey guys, been trying to improve my jQ and I figured creating a plugin would be a good way to get going. So I would like some constructive criticism, what I could do better and what I should not be doing. One thing that comes to mind is the // Errors I've done, could there be a better way? Appreciate your input! --> http://jsfiddle.net/aakBx/25/
[00:10:31] <Cork> ravenzz: depends on how generic it needs to be, cause if it
[00:11:03] <Cork> ravenzz: *'s waiting for submit someone might try to get whats selected and get the wrong value
[00:11:16] <ravenzz> uhm
[00:11:21] <ravenzz> that's correct..
[00:11:30] <Cork> ravenzz: and just storing it in an array or what you need, shouldn't cause performance problems
[00:11:36] <ravenzz> I'd like it to be as general as possible
[00:11:48] <Cork> then i would store it on use action
[00:11:56] <Cork> click/keypress/similar
[00:12:25] <ravenzz> I actually have a prototype, but is slow...because of a non 100% smart logic I guess
[00:13:13] <ravenzz> so I was trying to refactor / rethinking
[00:13:13] <Cork> ravenzz: is it suppose to support multiple selected options?
[00:13:18] <ravenzz> sure
[00:13:20] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/DBBzT/
[00:13:44] <Cork> then i would just use an array
[00:13:54] <Cork> and push/slice it from it
[00:14:05] <Cork> provide a function to get the values
[00:14:18] <pedda> hi all
[00:14:30] <pedda> i have a script which is replacing the src of an img..
[00:14:44] <pedda> how can i catch the change event with jquery ?
[00:14:54] <Cork> you can't
[00:14:57] <pedda> the change..script is not written in jquery
[00:15:03] <pedda> hmm
[00:15:03] <Cork> there is no event for changing src
[00:15:18] <pedda> so i need to adjust the change script itself?
[00:15:19] <Cork> you can catch the load event when the image loads (if the src is different)
[00:15:30] <ravenzz> Cork actually I think that I could change the select's value each time, and have a special case for "Select All" in which I use an array, instead of call the schange() function for each elem
[00:15:34] <Cork> if you want to know when the src is changed yes
[00:15:50] <pedda> i want to add some reflection with reflection.js for dynamicalle loaded images
[00:15:57] <pedda> *dynamically
[00:16:19] <pedda> but the loaded images are don't have the required css class
[00:16:39] <tw2113> so add the class?
[00:19:05] <pedda> i'm trying .. just started with this :-P
[00:32:26] <Draeli> salut
[00:32:43] <ravenzz> Cork btw what is the benefit of using slice over delete?
[00:32:51] <ravenzz> hi Draeli
[00:33:08] <Cork> you can't delete in an array
[00:33:21] <Cork> that will be the same as doing arr[index] = undefined
[00:33:24] <ravenzz> dalete array[index]
[00:33:30] <Cork> ^
[00:33:32] <ravenzz> delete
[00:33:48] <ravenzz> is that bad?
[00:34:16] <Cork> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr[2] = undefined; arr.length
[00:34:18] <ravenzz> I mean, if you slice, it has to "reallocate" the array
[00:34:19] <bot-t> Cork: 5
[00:34:28] <Cork> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; delete arr[2]; arr.length
[00:34:29] <bot-t> Cork: 5
[00:35:07] <ravenzz> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.slice(0,1); arr.length
[00:35:08] <bot-t> ravenzz: 5
[00:35:22] <Cork> slice doens't modify the array
[00:35:25] <Cork> you need to store it
[00:35:33] <ravenzz> oh sure
[00:35:47] <dirkpennings> hi guys, I'm struggeling with promise() and queued ajax requests, can someone point me out how I can use a done() function when completed all ajax calls? http://jsfiddle.net/9TG8t/56/
[00:35:47] <Cork> and sorry its splice not slice
[00:35:54] <ravenzz> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5], foo = arr.slice(0,1); foo.length
[00:35:55] <bot-t> ravenzz: 1
[00:36:01] <dirkpennings> (using this plugin http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/)
[00:36:11] <Cork> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.splice(2); arr.length
[00:36:12] <bot-t> Cork: 2
[00:36:16] <dirkpennings> maybe it can be much easier, but can't figure it out :(
[00:36:17] <Cork> wrong...
[00:36:38] <Cork> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.splice(2, 1); arr.length
[00:36:40] <bot-t> Cork: 4
[00:36:49] <Cork> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.splice(2, 1); arr
[00:36:50] <bot-t> Cork: [1, 2, 4, 5]
[00:36:56] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:37:19] <Cork> so thats why delete is a bad option
[00:37:21] <ravenzz> now I agrre
[00:37:26] <ravenzz> agree*
[00:37:49] <ravenzz> I mean I wasn't getting the advantage of using slice
[00:37:58] <ravenzz> but splice, yep make sense
[00:38:05] <greek> Hi fellas. I have a row with around 10 <td> cells. I'd like to get the position of a cell when I click on it, ie: when I click on the 3rd cell I want to see 3 (or event 2 is fine if we start counting from 0). Thanks
[00:38:12] <ravenzz> thank you
[00:38:28] <Cork> ravenzz: well slice works too
[00:38:44] <Cork> ravenzz: but you need to take the slice before what you want to remove and the slice after
[00:38:53] <Cork> but that would be the same as splice :D
[00:39:37] <Cork> ?.index @ greek
[00:39:38] <bot-t> greek, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[00:40:06] <ravenzz> do you mean arr = arr.slice(2, 1) ?
[00:40:13] <Cork> no
[00:40:48] <ravenzz> why would you get the slice before?
[00:40:56] <Cork> [arr.slice(0, x), arr.slice(x+1, arr.length)].join()
[00:41:10] <Cork> cause else you would lose the slice on either end
[00:41:37] <Cork> wait... hmmm join might return a string there
[00:41:46] <ravenzz> yea
[00:41:49] <greek> Cork thanks that worked
[00:41:50] <ravenzz> concat
[00:42:01] <Cork> ya
[00:42:28] <Cork> Array.concat(arr.slice(0, x), arr.slice(x+1, arr.length))
[00:42:29] <Cork> :)
[00:42:41] <ravenzz> oh well sure
[00:42:43] <Cork> but like i said thats basically the same as splize
[00:42:50] <ravenzz> I never read the slice documentation before
[00:42:51] <Cork> *splice
[00:42:59] <ravenzz> sorry
[00:43:12] <Cork> i mainly use it for strings
[00:43:29] <Cork> but a string is basicalle just an array of characters so...
[00:43:35] <Cork> *basically
[00:43:51] <ravenzz> yes
[00:44:19] <Cork> (almost said bytes there, but thats not true at all for js :D )
[00:44:30] <ravenzz> :d

[00:55:19] <yousaf> i am rendering around 1200 records on a page, its very slow so I need to use jquery to load say 30 records at a time and when users scroll down they will see more records
[00:55:36] <yousaf> I need some guidance on how I could implement this
[00:57:37] <da-beginner> hi, can i talk about backbone.js here? i'm a beginner and need some pointers on this template i've just installed
[00:58:08] <bigkevmcd> yousaf: http://railscasts.com/episodes/114-endless-page-revised might help

[01:00:22] <Cork> yousaf: check on infinite scroll
[01:00:42] <yousaf> Thank you Cord and bigkevmcd
[01:00:45] <greek> Cork the .index() is working great. I'm now trying to replace a td whose index is 5 with another td. My row is #parts, so how would I do something like $("#parts td[whose index is 5]").replaceWith("<td>new...</td>") ?
[01:01:44] <Cork> $('#parts td').eq(5)
[01:02:15] <bt9> How do I get a reference to the jquery tools tab object outside of a callback?
[01:02:35] <bt9> so i can call the equivalent of this.getPanes() etc
[01:02:36] <Alpha64> how can i select a lot of elements and transform them into progressbars? they all have different id's
[01:02:44] <Alpha64> by class?
[01:06:22] <Alpha64> <div class="prog">50%</div> suppose i have a bunch of divs like this and i want to transform them into a progressbar
[01:06:45] <Alpha64> with the percentage inside the div
[01:07:05] <Hooloovoo> Alpha64: you can use percentages in css
[01:07:38] <Hooloovoo> Alpha64: so basically, set a container outside each .prog div
[01:07:40] <Alpha64> $(".prog").progressbar( $(this).html()); ?
[01:08:02] <Hooloovoo> hmmm... you have a progressbar plugin?
[01:08:07] <Alpha64> jquery ui
[01:08:23] <jae> <div class="prog"><div class="status" style="width:50%;"></div></div>       div.prog{position:relative;} div.status{ position:absolute;}
[01:08:23] <Hooloovoo> oh
[01:08:34] <jae> there alpha
[01:08:35] <Hooloovoo> making a progressbar is so easy i wouldn't use a plugin
[01:08:38] <jae> simple html
[01:09:49] <Alpha64> mhmh
[01:10:33] <Cork> Hooloovoo: agreed
[01:11:41] <greek> Cork thanks works :)
[01:12:42] <bt9> anyone know how to get a ref to tools tab objects outside of callback?
[01:12:59] <ravenzz> Cork is this ok? http://jsfiddle.net/eGKXM/1/ or instead of mapping the "siblings" values into an array I should slice for each sibling?
[01:13:56] <ravenzz> splice*
[01:14:38] <Cork> ravenzz: what is it you're trying to do?
[01:14:54] <nathanstaines> i've got a js file with a number of .on('click') events. I'm wondering what the best way to structure the file would be? Currently they're all inside a Immediately-Invoked Function Expression.
[01:15:13] <Cork> ravenzz: are you trying to reimplemented inArray?
[01:15:15] <tom_may> hey guys, I use a selector to select some links $("div#some_container a.checked"). I now want to concatenate all href values to a string. $("div#some_container a.checked").each(function{str += this.attr(''href);}); doesn't seem to work,.. how would I do this?
[01:15:52] <ravenzz> when you select a bunch of items (in a multiple select) and you stop holing CTRL if you click on an option, it will be selected
[01:16:58] <Cork> heh this brings back memory :)
[01:17:15] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/4FP3A/ <-
[01:17:19] <Cork> i fiddle with the same problems back when i created a grid widget a few years back :)
[01:17:55] <ravenzz> ehe
[01:19:47] <Cork> ravenzz: if you store the reference to what was selected last
[01:19:58] <Cork> ravenzz: then you can use nextUntil
[01:20:06] <Cork> and get a list of all the elements quite easily
[01:20:15] <Trisox> hey cork
[01:20:28] <Cork> o/
[01:20:45] <Trisox> \o/
[01:21:28] <nathanstaines> I'm sure there's a better way to structure this js file: http://jsfiddle.net/sZ7Jv/ any tips?
[01:21:44] <ravenzz> Cork siblings() is not only about nextUntil
[01:22:08] <Cork> nathanstaines: you could combind the different $('div.accordion') listeners
[01:22:22] <Cork> $('div.accordion').on('show').on('hide')
[01:22:27] <Cork> sam for basket
[01:23:05] <Cork> $('#change-address').find('a').on('click') could be a delegated event listener instead
[01:23:23] <Trisox> should i use document.body.clientWidth or $( document ).width() ?
[01:23:26] <Cork> same for $('p.more-less').find('a')
[01:23:55] <Cork> is that even the same thing?
[01:24:00] <Trisox> think so
[01:24:25] <nathanstaines> Cork: I thought .delegate() was superseded by .on() ?
[01:24:28] <Cork> Trisox: you need to test really careful when you start using the different width values on document, window and body
[01:24:40] <Trisox> yea i know
[01:24:40] <Cork> Trisox: what you get differ quite a lot from browser to browser
[01:24:51] <Cork> and i don't remember in what way
[01:24:53] <Trisox> its ie8 only
[01:25:09] <Cork> nathanstaines: yes and no, but you'r not using a delegated selector
[01:25:09] <Trisox> so that saves me some testing
[01:25:22] <nathanstaines> and what about the structure of the file? is it normal to just have all the .on('click') events inside one IIFE?
[01:25:38] <Cork> nathanstaines: on doesn't really supersede delegate, its a combined function for all event bindings
[01:25:56] <Cork> nathanstaines: only one of the old functions that really changed is live, thats depricated
[01:26:17] <Cork> nathanstaines: if you want to express delegate with on its .on('event', 'target', function)
[01:26:41] <Cork> ( for delegate its .delegate('target', 'event', function) )
[01:27:12] <Trisox> Cork: i got some preformence problems on ie8
[01:27:20] <Trisox> so i go back to native js no jquery
[01:27:27] <Trisox> speed it up a little
[01:27:28] <nathanstaines> so that would make it $('p.more-less').on('click', 'a', function()) ?
[01:27:39] <Cork> Trisox: find what causes the slowdown instead
[01:27:48] <Trisox> animation :)
[01:27:56] <Cork> Trisox: in many places it doesn't matter, its better to fix the performance problems
[01:27:58] <Cork> ya
[01:28:15] <Trisox> problem is that animation always will be slow in ie8
[01:28:20] <Cork> nathanstaines: in that situation yes
[01:28:38] <Cork> Trisox: cause ie8 is slow; period
[01:28:42] <Trisox> yea
[01:28:44] <Trisox> i know
[01:28:51] <Cork> though at least not as slow as ie7
[01:28:55] <Trisox> every bit win = win at this point
[01:29:00] <Trisox> dont have to suport ie7 :D
[01:29:11] <tolborg> I want to do cross browser form element styling. Which plugin/s do you use?
[01:29:18] <Cork> if you support ie8 its a small task to support ie7 as far as i know
[01:29:42] <Cork> tolborg: plugin?
[01:29:46] <Cork> its called css
[01:29:50] <Trisox> true Cork but if i dont have to
[01:30:06] <Cork> tolborg: and a few of them you should stay away from
[01:30:14] <Cork> like select elements and file inputs
[01:30:15] <tolborg> Cork.. hehe.. you know what i mean.. a plugin like uniform.js
[01:30:43] <tolborg> Cork.. unfortunately I have a mad designer who wants custom elements :(
[01:31:04] <Cork> tolborg: then ask him if he want mobile support
[01:31:16] <Cork> cause those will break that
[01:31:27] <tolborg> Cork.. this one works on iphone at least: http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-selectBox/
[01:32:04] <Cork> yes, it "works" but in the form that it designs the element the same as on desktop
[01:32:19] <Cork> overflown elements works REALLY badly on mobile
[01:32:38] <Cork> so if you replace select elements and render it like desktop it won't work well on mobile
[01:33:12] <Cork> tolborg: mobiles normally use a "overlay" list for select elements
[01:33:27] <tolborg> so does this one actually
[01:33:31] <Cork> and you don't want to replace that one, cause the will degrade the usability of the site quite a lot
[01:33:55] <tolborg> I think that this one just disables on mobile
[01:34:05] <tolborg> and uses mobile user agent styling
[01:34:18] <Cork> jiks...
[01:34:47] <nathanstaines> Cork: I've made the changes you suggested http://jsfiddle.net/sZ7Jv/1/ still not sure about the varibles I have declared half way down the page like nav and navItem, should I wrap that bit in a function of it's own?
[01:36:24] <Cork> nathanstaines: why don't you just do var navItems = $('#head .nav li'); ?
[01:37:14] <nathanstaines> good call ;)
[01:37:41] <Cork> $(this).parent() => $this.parent()
[01:37:58] <Cork> in $('p.more-less').on('click', 'a', function() {
[01:38:50] <coppa> whoo ho I am a super star lol
[01:39:04] <coppa> I v got 11 star of a jquery plugin in github
[01:39:46] <coppa> if any of those interested of automatic ajax navigation hyper mobile friendly https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[01:40:18] <Cork> nathanstaines: looks like $('a.add-cart').on('click') and $('a.add-wishlist').on('click') could be merged if you separate the siblings call
[01:41:10] <Cork> nathanstaines: $('input[name="inputDelivery"]').on('change') could use an array for the id's and remove all the duplicated code
[01:41:28] <coppa> the plugin also fix the show&hide address bar on each link-click
[01:42:11] <Trisox> Cork: its mostly the use of tweenlite.js witch slows it down
[01:42:38] <Cork> nathanstaines: $('#accordion-basket').on('show').on('hide) could be combined in a toggle if you move the text() into hidden spans in the html instead (where it belongs)
[01:43:02] <Cork> tweenlite.js?, never heard of it actually :)
[01:43:12] <Trisox> ?tweenlite.js
[01:43:14] <bot-t> Trisox, Couldn't find "tweenlite.js" in jQuery Docs.

[01:44:11] <nathanstaines> Cork: I understand about the accordion-basket toggle but you lost me with the other two points sorry.
[01:44:29] <nathanstaines> I would I separate the siblings call?
[01:45:16] <coppa> tweenlight seems a weird plugin
[01:45:53] <Trisox> well true it is but helps with animation a lot
[01:50:57] <Cork> nathanstaines: http://jsfiddle.net/sZ7Jv/2/
[01:51:13] <Cork> nathanstaines: something like that (a bit of hack an slash but i hope you get the idea)
[01:52:15] <hExDJ> I have a php form with a radio button selection of 4 possible items, but the values change, would it be possible to know if the 12t, 2nd, 3rd or 4th button is selected? meaning without checking its value?
[01:52:34] <hExDJ> 12t=1st
[01:53:08] <Cork> hExDJ: bind a delegated event listener on the form that listens for click on the option elements
[01:53:29] <nathanstaines> Cork: yeah thanks, that's real helpful ;)
[01:53:32] <GabrielR> huh, why does this:  $('#part1_frame1').fadeTo(900,1).delay(5000, MyFunction);    call MyFunction immediately and not after 5 seconds?   I though the function call is a completion call
[01:53:46] <hExDJ> cork: not sure I got that, do you have an example?
[01:54:49] <Cork> hExDJ: $('form').on('click', 'option[name="my_options"]', function(event) {});
[01:54:55] <Cork> bah sorry
[01:55:01] <Cork> hExDJ: $('form').on('click', 'input[name="my_options"]', function(event) {});
[01:55:56] <hExDJ> cork that will listen for the click, but will it tell me the index of the radio button?
[01:56:44] <Cork> GabrielR: you're creating a delay queue with a first value delayed for 500 ms and it has the name of MyFunction (object id)
[01:57:11] <Cork> GabrielR: if you want to wait for the fadeTo, you need to use it's compete callback
[01:57:26] <Cork> hExDJ: $(this).val()
[01:57:50] <Cork> hExDJ: and depending on how you did it $(this).index() might work
[01:58:10] <Cork> ?.delay @ GabrielR
[01:58:11] <bot-t> GabrielR, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[01:58:12] <hExDJ> but that will give me the value, which is what I want to avoid since the value changes
[01:58:21] <Cork> ah
[01:58:28] <Cork> then you can try using the .index()
[01:59:06] <hExDJ> k, will give it a try, thanks
[02:00:16] <GabrielR> heh, Cork  so the question is so common it has an auto bot response.  Awesome
[02:00:37] <Cork> GabrielR: no, ? can look up anything in api.jquery.com
[02:00:38] <Eviltwin> GabrielR: It's an API method
[02:00:44] <Eviltwin> Clearly documented on api.jquery.com
[02:01:50] <GabrielR> Clearly is a matter of interpretation.  The Jquery docs are aroundthe quality of the Sony ps2 graphics processor assembly code references
[02:02:03] <GabrielR> Thanks for the help Cork.
[02:02:30] <Cork> not sure how you get ".delay(duration, [queueName])" to be ".delay(duration, function)"
[02:02:42] <Cork> find it quite clear that it doens't take a function callback
[02:04:02] <Eviltwin> The jQuery docs are extensive and extremely thorough
[02:09:08] <GabrielR> Starting a doc flame war isn't why I came. hehe.  Thanks for the help guys.   I was clearly overlooking basic information.  That takes me pretty far along on solving my animation issues
[02:09:22] <GabrielR> God I love IRC
[02:09:25] <Trisox> :)
[02:12:40] <bt9> is there a jquery tools channel?
[02:13:52] <Cork> bt9: http://jquerytools.org/forum/tools/
[02:13:59] <bt9> ty
[02:14:50] <ezhilvanan> Hi bt9 u can get jquery irc channel
[02:15:07] <bt9> you mean this one? :)
[02:15:56] <ezhilvanan> plz refer http://blog.jquery.com/2007/02/17/the-jquery-irc-channel/
[02:16:04] <rethus1> i use this plugin in: http://www.slidesjs.com/ on http://www.aerobis.com/ but the slide stumble before stopped...
[02:16:25] <ezhilvanan> slide for Mobile or Web App?
[02:16:27] <rethus1> i search a lot in my css, but i didn't found the reason. Anyone can give me a hint?
[02:16:30] <Cork> ezhilvanan: he asked about jquery tools
[02:16:38] <bt9> web app
[02:16:46] <Cork> ezhilvanan: thats not part of jquery's library
[02:17:00] <ezhilvanan> I'm sorry Cork
[02:17:55] <Cork> bt9: you might find someone in here over time that know the lib
[02:18:21] <Cork> all i know about it is that its similar to jquery-ui but a bit hacksh in its coding
[02:18:37] <bt9> no worries
[02:18:45] <Cork> (that might have changed since i looked at it though)
[02:19:30] <bt9> hmm that forum link you posted, I can't seem to login to post in it
[02:20:22] <rethus1> first slide seems to be well, but following wil fill
[02:20:25] <rethus1> flip
[02:20:33] <Cork> bt9: you need to go into the correct section first
[02:21:56] <Cork> bt9: that said, i've never used it so donno how it works
[02:22:06] <bt9> yes but new thread button gives 'authentication required' notice with no link to register/login
[02:22:17] <bt9> strange
[02:27:37] <Cork> bt9: they might depend on some plugin or something (you might need a "license" or something to access it)
[02:51:54] <motox> How can I pass a variable into the callback function with .animate?  example:  $('#foo').animate({'top':'20%'},{duration:3000,easing:'swing',complete:function(myvar)
[02:54:34] <Eviltwin> motox: http://jsfiddle.net/p5y5e/
[02:56:48] <motox> eviltwin> That is assuming that myvar is a global though
[02:56:58] <motox> In this case it is not a global, nor do I want it to be
[02:57:13] <Eviltwin> It's a non-local
[02:57:41] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/p5y5e/1/
[02:57:45] <Eviltwin> Works the exact same way
[03:01:01] <motox> ok, thanks
[03:01:10] <motox> As long as its not global, I will do that then
[03:06:23] <bonhoeffer> if i have a reference to my <div> with 'this' and i want the url of an anchor inside that div, what is the best way to reference that?
[03:06:48] <Eviltwin> $(this).find("a").attr("href")?
[03:07:11] <vividrain> maybe someone can help me with jquery-ui tabs cacheing?
[03:07:32] <Eviltwin> I'm out unfortunately
[03:07:36] <vividrain> I've got a set of nested tabs created with { cache: true }, but the first one that opens always reloads the first it is reselected
[03:07:37] <Eviltwin> This is my last message for the evening
[03:10:37] <bonhoeffer> Eviltwin, thanks!
[03:14:10] <bonhoeffer> $(this).attr("href").split("/") -> ["", "events", "75"] -- i want the 75 -- why doesn't $(this).attr("href").split("/")[2] work?
[03:14:45] <Cork> ?eval var split = ["", "events", "75"]; split[2]
[03:14:47] <bot-t> Cork: "75"
[03:14:51] <Cork> should work just fine
[03:15:39] <bonhoeffer> hmm ... does, sorry, i had a syntax error
[03:17:23] <ezhil> Hi
[03:18:03] <ezhil> Which is the Best tooltip to apply on any element jquery
[03:18:29] <jae> alt="tooltip"
[03:18:47] <Cork> s/alt/title/
[03:18:52] <Cork> alt isn't a tooltip
[03:18:53] <treeprogram> Hi, how would I remove the 'selected' attribute from an 'option' element in order to deselect the default selection in an a select element drop down?
[03:19:25] <ezhil> I need to apply on td elements
[03:19:34] <ezhil> is it possible?
[03:19:40] <ezhil> bu using alt?
[03:20:09] <treeprogram> For example, a list of animals inside <select><option value="lion">lion</option><option value="cow">cow</option><option value="></option></select>
[03:20:49] <treeprogram> sorry, the last <option> should be <option value="bird" selected></bird>
[03:21:27] <treeprogram> and I want to remove the 'selected' attribute upon a button click so the user no longer sees the 'bird' option selected
[03:21:37] <ezhil> treeprogram:$('#mySelect option:selected').removeAttr('selected');
[03:23:58] <treeprogram> ezhil thanks, would $("option:selected").removeAttr("selected"); work? Because I'm trying it and the default selection remains
[03:24:48] <ezhil> then apply this selected attr to ur first element of the dropdown
[03:25:23] <GeO2> hey
[03:25:39] <GeO2> how can I use jquery to apply a css filter to an element ?
[03:25:49] <treeprogram> ezhil but I want to select another option element upon button click, so the flow would be: remove selected attribute from option element, add selected attribute to another option element
[03:25:54] <ezhil> or use $('#mySelect').val('new value');
[03:25:56] <GeO2> something like div { +filter: grayscale(100%); }
[03:26:09] <GeO2> I'm used to $.css()  but I don't know the syntax for filters
[03:26:50] <ezhil> Ge02: #selector.css('color', 'red');
[03:27:26] <Myx0x3> im not sure how to dont sort empty objects.. im useing "stupid table plugin"
[03:27:45] <GeO2> ezhil : that is to apply a basic css rule, I try to apply a filter such as +filter: grayscale(100%); (CSS 3)
[03:28:33] <ezhil> Ge02 : I'm sorry. I dont know that.
[03:29:20] <ezhil> button.click(function(){ $('#mySelect').val('new value');})
[03:29:54] <ezhil> treeprogram: try the above code
[03:30:14] <treeprogram> ezhil if I use $('#myselect').val(new value); then the site user wouldn't be able to select the option that was written over any more, right?
[03:30:42] <treeprogram> ezhil oh I just saw that one min
[03:31:10] <Cork> treeprogram: .val on the select element just changes the selection, not the options in it
[03:31:30] <treeprogram> Cork oh I see
[03:32:45] <motox> Eviltwin> Are you still online?
[03:32:47] <GeO2> ezakimak found it, .css('-webkit-filter','grayscale(100%)'); for instance
[03:33:15] <Cork> GeO2: that only works in webkit though
[03:33:25] <Cork> (with or without the prefix)
[03:33:59] <Cork> opera doesn't support filter at all, and gecko uses svg file references for its filters
[03:34:18] <Cork> (ie doesn't support any of them in ie9, not sure about ie10)
[03:34:20] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a simple way of passing a returned js variable to PHP?
[03:34:44] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ajax is only way to get the data from js to the server
[03:34:55] <fRAiLtY-> Ok
[03:35:06] <Cork> unless you're doing full page posts or gets
[03:35:21] <ezhil> which is the best tooltip that can apply on any element?
[03:35:44] <motox> How can I pass a variable into the callback function with .animate?  example:  $('#foo').animate({'top':'20%'},{duration:3000,easing:'swing',complete:function(myvar){doSomething();}});   I can't set var myVar = x; before the animation call because the animation call is in a loop, so it will change before the animation finishes
[03:35:50] <fRAiLtY-> I have a returned jQuery variable that I want to pass into a PHP function..
[03:35:52] <ezhil> Hi Cork, Do u 've any idea?
[03:36:29] <ezhil>  which is the best tooltip that can apply on any element?
[03:36:42] <Cork> ezhil: http://www.webdesignbooth.com/15-jquery-plugins-to-create-an-user-friendly-tooltip/
[03:36:52] <Cork> my personal fav is beautytip
[03:37:03] <Cork> i've heavily mod the code for my self though
[03:37:03] <GeO2> Cork : .css('-webkit-filter','grayscale(100%)').css('filter','grayscale(100%)').css('-moz-filter','grayscale(100%)').css('-ms-filter','grayscale(100%)').css('-o-filter','grayscale(100%)');  should do it
[03:37:20] <GeO2> well for all the modern browsers at least
[03:37:36] <Cork> GeO2: sure, IF the browsers supported them
[03:37:43] <Cork> but .css('-moz-filter','grayscale(100%)').css('-ms-filter','grayscale(100%)').css('-o-filter','grayscale(100%)'); isn't supported
[03:37:47] <Cork> GeO2: no
[03:38:15] <Cork> GeO2: gecko has only support for ex -moz-filter: url(filter.svg#grayscale);
[03:38:20] <ezhil> thanks Cork
[03:38:20] <Cork> opera doesn't support it at all
[03:38:29] <Cork> and ie 9 at least has no support
[03:38:43] <ezhil> what's up treeprogram?
[03:39:02] <Cork> ?mdc filter @ GeO2
[03:39:08] <bot-t> GeO2, Array filter method - JavaScript | MDN - Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter

[03:40:06] <GeO2> oki
[03:40:18] <personne> hi I need some help, I want to get the id of a <div> when i'm clicking on it, but not the <div>'s id parent, how to?
[03:40:37] <Cork> GeO2: funny enough i fiddled with this extensively just a weak ago :)
[03:41:09] <Cork> ah, right sorry forgot
[03:41:25] <GeO2> yo ustill have it ?
[03:41:29] <motox> personne:     <div onclick="$(this).attr('id')">
[03:41:41] <GeO2> I'd like to run my own tests on it
[03:41:44] <Cork> ie has support through its weird progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage syntax
[03:41:50] <motox> personne:     <div onclick="alert($(this).attr('id'))">
[03:42:06] <Cork> GeO2: have it?
[03:42:10] <personne> ok thx i'll try now
[03:42:18] <Cork> i'm using it on a web app i'm implementing
[03:42:25] <motox> make sure you add the id="dfsdf" in there too
[03:42:40] <Cork> thats why i fiddled with it, i wanted to reduce the number of images i needed as much as possible
[03:42:48] <Cork> (for mobile support)
[03:44:06] <GeO2> I mean you still have a fiddle link so I can see your work?
[03:44:09] <personne> motox: but i want to make possible to select the <div> parent if i click on it
[03:44:35] <Cork> GeO2: ah, no it wasn't jsfiddle
[03:44:36] <personne> so if i click on a children a have the children alert and the parent too
[03:44:45] <GeO2> oki
[03:44:52] <Cork> i meant it literally
[03:44:53] <Cork> :)
[03:45:25] <personne> motox :and i don't want the parent's alert
[03:45:34] <Cork> trial and error trying to make it work in gecko, webkit and presto
[03:45:57] <Cork> GeO2: the sad part is that presto has no support for filters at all
[03:46:03] <Cork> didn't expect that
[03:46:04] <ezhil> personne : a.click(){ this.parent.attr('id'); }
[03:49:32] <ezhil> personne: try this: <div id="divID"><a onclick="alert($(this).parent.attr('id'))"></a></div>
[03:49:53] <personne> ezhil: well I have only <div> like that <div id="1">     <div id="2"></div>      <div id="3"></div>    </div> And i want that: if i click on the div with id=3  only alert with this one, and if i click on the div with id =1 only the alert of this one
[03:50:31] <personne> I mean the first clicked
[03:51:37] <ezhil> do u have <a> tag inside the all divs
[03:51:42] <personne> no
[03:51:46] <personne> only div
[03:54:02] <ezhil> u already have the ids right?
[03:54:12] <ezhil> inside the div tag
[03:54:18] <personne> yes
[03:56:11] <ezhil> then $('#1 or #2 or #3').click(function(){ alert(this.attr('id'));}
[03:56:54] <Cork> or??
[03:56:59] <Cork> that doens't work
[03:57:08] <ravenzz> uhm, can someone help me to figure out what is wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/ggV6B/ ? After the initialization the console outputs the correct current value for each select, when I select a new value (try with the 3rd select) selectMenu is called and $select.val() is null
[03:57:17] <Cork> $('#1, #2, #3') is how you write it in css
[03:57:42] <ravenzz> selectMenuChange() is called sorry
[03:57:54] <ezhil> otherwise use common class for all divs and write a click event
[03:57:56] <personne> Is it possible?
[03:58:30] <ezhil> $('.class').click(function(){ alert(this.attr('id')); })
[03:58:44] <Cork> personne: this.id should give you the id of the clicked element
[03:59:04] <Cork> ezhil: this doens't have an attr function
[03:59:45] <personne> cork: yes but when i click on the inner div the parent div is clicked too and i don't want to call it
[03:59:50] <soee> if i have some function like lightbox assigned to element ($(elem).lightbox(); )- how can i remove it from element ?
[04:00:07] <Cork> personne: check if event.target == this
[04:00:30] <Cork> .click(function(event){ if(event.target === this) {} });
[04:01:04] <Cork> personne: or you can use event.stopPropagation() on the other elements
[04:01:29] <ezhil> Cork: Neither this.id or $(this).attr("id") will work if the element does not have an explicitly defined id.
[04:01:32] <Cork> personne: depending on what precession you need
[04:01:37] <personne> ok i try it
[04:01:45] <Cork> ezhil: true
[04:01:48] <GeO2> Cork : a nice site about filters http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/filters/
[04:02:07] <Cork> ezhil: my .attr remakr was that you ran it on this.attr
[04:02:40] <Cork> GeO2: nice, but inaccurate
[04:02:57] <Cork> it only checks the css3 new defined value
[04:03:02] <Cork> there is more support then that
[04:03:09] <ezhil> well thanks
[04:04:30] <Cork> GeO2: ie has support through its old filter system, gecko has support through svg files, webkit has it through the new standard and presto has no support
[04:07:43] <personne> Cork: it don't work, pipo1 & pipo 2 are my ids
[04:07:47] <personne>  $('#zonePref').click(function(event){ if(event.target === "pipo1") {alert("1")}else if(event.target === "pipo2"){alert("2")} });
[04:08:04] <Cork> uh, what?
[04:08:14] <Cork> your listening on $('#zonePref')
[04:08:29] <personne> it is the global div
[04:08:55] <Cork> is $('#zonePref').on('click', '#pipo1, #pipo2', function(event) {}); what you're trying to do?
[04:09:14] <Cork> ah btw you're checking agenst a string
[04:09:20] <Cork> target is a dom element
[04:10:11] <Cork> personne: $('#zonePref').click(function(event){ if(event.target.id == undefined) { return } if(event.target.id === "pipo1") {alert("1")} else if(event.target.id === "pipo2"){alert("2")} });
[04:10:40] <ravenzz> actually if you need to do that dirty thing
[04:10:46] <ravenzz> just bind it twice
[04:10:50] <Cork> true
[04:11:04] <Cork> that's what delegate is for
[04:11:18] <Cork> $('#zonePref').on('click', '#pipo1', function(event) {});.on('click', '#pipo2', function(event) {});
[04:11:24] <ravenzz> ^
[04:11:38] <ravenzz> without the semicolon :)
[04:11:46] <Cork> LOL
[04:11:59] <Cork> $('#zonePref').on('click', '#pipo1', function(event) { {alert("1") }).on('click', '#pipo2', function(event) { {alert("2") });
[04:12:01] <Cork> there :)
[04:12:33] <xec_> and the extra {'s :D
[04:12:40] <Guest88844> Cork: 2 id's ... wy ?
[04:13:00] <ravenzz> noow tha you are free, could you help me ? :]]
[04:13:06] <Cork> lol
[04:13:06] <Trisox> doesnt look very optimized
[04:13:12] <Cork> Trisox: its not
[04:13:15] <Trisox> oke ;)
[04:13:17] <Cork> but its better then the original
[04:13:25] <Trisox> agreed
[04:13:58] <ravenzz> anyway it really depends on what he was/is trying to do..
[04:14:19] <ravenzz> maybe he just need the digits from the ID?! maybe not.
[04:14:38] <Cork> or maybe the alerts is just to test
[04:15:06] <Trisox> i never act on mabye's
[04:15:15] <Trisox> :p
[04:15:19] <Cork> you prefer to assume? :)
[04:15:26] <personne> Cork: well i don't kknow why but it don't work..
[04:15:31] <Trisox> no... thats worse
[04:15:36] <Cork> :D
[04:16:04] <Cork> personne: $('#zonePref').on('click', '#pipo1', function(event) { alert("1") }).on('click', '#pipo2', function(event) { alert("2") }); doesn't work?
[04:16:13] <Cork> or did you try one of the earlier ones?
[04:16:28] <Trisox> not  if pipo 2 or 1 is outside the zonePref
[04:16:29] <Trisox> :p
[04:16:53] <Cork> exactly cause if that one doesn't work your structure isn't what you described
[04:16:59] <personne> there are in
[04:18:20] <Cork> ravenzz: about your problem sorry, too much code, could  try to have a look at it when i get home in about two hours
[04:18:54] <ravenzz> mh well actually the issue is pretty restricted to 1 or 2 line of code
[04:19:00] <Trisox> ravenzz: link to code?
[04:19:00] <personne> http://pastebin.com/Ey5g295x    ok it work but i have again 1 & 2 in alert
[04:19:50] <Cork> personne: i had some extra {} in there -_-' you can remove those
[04:20:03] <Cork> (around the alerts)
[04:21:18] <personne> yep i did it but when i click on pipo2 i have always the alter 1
[04:21:22] <personne> alert*
[04:21:49] <ravenzz> Trisox, Cork http://jsfiddle.net/ggV6B/1/ here the IIFE create the UL from the Select + sets the Select value if there were selected options. This is what you see in the console when you run the script. But when you select an option (try with the 3rd UL) the selecMenuChange() function is called, and here the Select value is NULL (wtf), see the console
[04:22:31] <PY1NB1> how bad is it to call  $(document).ready( function(){... more than once?
[04:22:49] <Cork> personne: http://jsfiddle.net/8kGrf/3/
[04:22:51] <Cork> wfm
[04:23:02] <Cork> ah, wait
[04:24:08] <Cork> personne: http://jsfiddle.net/8kGrf/4/
[04:25:15] <Cork> PY1NB1: not bad at all
[04:25:24] <PY1NB1> oh, great! thanks :)

[04:35:02] <havvg> hi there, when aborting an jqXHR and later on requesting the same resource again, the request is not fired, is there an option required to have the request being made?
[04:35:25] <Alopex> Hello! http://pastebin.com/Mh4JHtLz    and i'm trying autocomplete to complete on facebook friends (fbFriends) but autocomplete does not work. In console, fbFriends returns a lot of [object Object]s
[04:35:54] <Cork> havvg: are you making a new ajax request? or are you trying to reuse the old jqXHR object?
[04:36:24] <Cork> havvg: the reason i'm asking is cause if you cancel a request or not shouldn't matter
[04:36:37] <Cork> (for future requests that is)
[04:36:54] <seutje> Alopex: why are u settings the value of the same element twice in rapid succession?
[04:37:05] <havvg> hm.. dunno, have to check the backbone source, gimme a bit of time :)
[04:37:25] <seutje> Alopex: also, that "FB.init" statement doesn't do anything, does it?
[04:37:48] <seutje> gotta actually call the function
[04:38:18] <Alopex> you mean data and label both = name? Well, i read from somewhere data has to be present. And FB init is working. i just didn't paste the code of it because i know that it works and though of it as irrelevant
[04:38:58] <Cork> Alopex:   $("#userautocomplete").val(ui.item.data); $("#userautocomplete").val(ui.item.label);
[04:39:16] <Cork> ?eval "#userautocomplete" === "#userautocomplete"
[04:39:19] <bot-t> Cork: true
[04:39:35] <soee> i have ul element with some height set, is it possible to animate this list to change its height from current height to height required to show all items ?
[04:40:07] <Cork> soee: sure
[04:40:14] <havvg> Cork, it's a new one on every request
[04:40:32] <Alopex> Cork : that shouldn't be there, i just didn't have anything to do with the data field (so i but it there), cos i only need label and value
[04:40:35] <Cork> might need some hankering though, not sure if animate supports 'auto'
[04:41:03] <Cork> havvg: then it shouldn't have anything to do with it
[04:41:20] <Cork> havvg: you prob staring at the wrong problem :)
[04:41:27] <ravenzz> ....
[04:41:35] <Cork> (and yes that is quite easy to do)
[04:41:39] * ravenzz iditos
[04:41:42] <ravenzz> -s
[04:41:43] <Cork> <_<
[04:42:03] <Cork> ravenzz: what are you talking about
[04:42:48] <ravenzz> i was calling the selectMenu's reset method, instead of just bind the plugin
[04:42:55] <soee> Cork, more tips ?
[04:43:00] <Cork> ravenzz: heh
[04:43:03] <ravenzz> $("select").selectMenu("reset")
[04:43:08] <ravenzz> :
[04:43:09] <ravenzz> °
[04:43:38] <Cork> soee: you could try $('select').animate({ height: 'auto' });
[04:43:59] <Cork> soee: you might have to calculate the needed height though, not sure if animate does that for you
[04:44:44] <soee> Cork, this way it just shows it good but withot any animation
[04:45:14] <havvg> hm.. Cork, what I'm doing: I'm loading polygons for a google map (some of them contain much data), when the user alters the input and the prev. request has not yet finished, it's being aborted, so only the request for the current input is active and will refresh the map upon completion
[04:45:15] <Cork> ok, so you need to calc it
[04:45:48] <Cork> soee: var old_height = $('selector').height(); $('selector').css('height', 'auto'); var height = $('selector').height(); $('selector').height(old_height); $('selector').animate({ height: height });
[04:46:25] <Cork> havvg: you might land in cache problems
[04:46:36] <Cork> that's the only reason i can think of
[04:46:38] <havvg> on aborted requests?
[04:46:43] <Cork> ya
[04:46:58] <havvg> ah, so it's chrome caching the result? - that may be true :(
[04:47:01] <Cork> the browser thinks it has it in cache and doesn't request it
[04:47:19] <Cork> might even be a browser bug
[04:47:25] <Cork> test it in another browser and see
[04:47:45] <Cork> havvg: an option is to avoid the cache
[04:47:57] <Cork> but that will increase the netload
[04:48:29] <Cork> it would be a quite simple way to test if its actually caused by the cache
[04:48:38] <karstenk1977_> Please someone who knows jQuery Tools? Whats this for an error? http://steuerkanzlei.tom-develop.com/
[04:49:06] <karstenk1977_> It isn´t the hash for the id, is it?
[04:50:03] <asker> is it possible to resize the browserwindow?
[04:50:34] <Cork> asker: only if you created it through window.open, AND the user has that option enabled in its settings
[04:50:52] <seutje> Alopex: should work if u enter the App ID afaict:
[04:50:53] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/QG47N/
[04:53:02] <asker> Cork: so its not for everyone
[04:53:33] <Cork> asker: its heavily restricted cause of all the abuse it's been under through the years
[04:54:01] <asker> ok, is there anyway to stop user making the window-width smaller then 800px?
[04:54:13] <Cork> (pop-unders, pop-overs, hidden windows (width=0,height=0) and so on
[04:54:22] <asker> or do i have to make a responsive design to solve it?
[04:54:25] <Cork> asker: no
[04:54:41] <Cork> you can force scrollbars
[04:54:58] <Cork> body { min-width: 800px; }
[04:55:23] <Cork> (or what ever element you want to put it on)
[04:58:07] <asker> kk ty
[04:58:11] <asker> i will try some stuff
[05:01:16] <ezhil> How to find Missing Dates B/w 2 dates in Jquery or Mysql Query?
[05:02:58] <havvg> Cork, I added debug auto into the complete callback, which isn't printed, I guess this confirms the browser (or anything else but jquery) is caching the request?
[05:03:10] <havvg> s/auto/output
[05:03:39] <Cork> havvg: try adding an extra junk param to the request
[05:03:47] <Cork> &nocache=true
[05:03:58] <Cork> or rather =timestamp
[05:04:26] <Cork> Date url + '&' + Date.now()
[05:04:30] <Cork> bah
[05:04:33] <Cork> * url + '&' + Date.now()

[05:10:03] <ezhil> Cork : need to store these dates into an array
[05:10:22] <havvg> oh crap, thank you Cork :) - I was caching the results around the requests (the collection being built) on the wrong event!
[05:10:35] <havvg> working now as expected :)
[05:10:40] <Cork> :)
[05:11:21] <Cork> ezhil: you can create a start date, then have a loop where you step it up one day until its not < then the end date
[05:13:01] <ezhil> Cork : i got the Dates.. But is there any SQL Query available to find missing dates?
[05:13:29] <Cork> uh.. heh you're a bit off topic for that :)
[05:13:57] <Cork> ezhil: straight of my head, no i think you would have to check each date
[05:14:14] <Cork> ezhil: but that question is prob better asked in a more suited channel
[05:14:46] <ezhil> Cork: u r right
[05:14:52] <ezhil> thanks Cork
[05:15:09] <slartsa> ezhil: i'd dump the data and process it
[05:18:13] <ezhil> slartsa: thanks for ur reply.. I want SQL Query to get the Missing dates, How?]
[05:23:14] <slartsa> as I said, I'd dump the data, process it and either push modified data back or create new data to sql
[05:24:45] <treeprogram> Hi, can any one suggest how I can turn a Javascript object into data that can be stored in a cookie? I'm guessing it needs to be serialized. Can I do this inside a jquery function? If so, how?
[05:26:25] <Cork> treeprogram: JSON.stringify(obj)
[05:26:39] <Cork> treeprogram: it can't have dom elements or function references though
[05:27:01] <soee> how can i get left margin value ?
[05:27:44] <Cork> soee: css('margin-left') though that's not perfect
[05:27:57] <soee> any better way ?
[05:28:13] <Cork> soee: not for specifically one side no
[05:29:01] <treeprogram> Cork, thanks, but I actually tried JSON.stringify() and for some strange reason, it didn't work. There are no dom elements or function references in the object too. Would this work:  $string=JSON.stringify(obj);  $.cookie("the cookie", string);  ?
[05:29:20] <treeprogram> sorry, no $, PHP mode
[05:29:31] <Cork> depends on whats in the js object
[05:29:38] <Cork> you might heave to encode the json string too
[05:30:24] <treeprogram> Cork how do I encode json string?
[05:30:39] <Cork> treeprogram: window.encodeURI(string)
[05:30:53] <treeprogram> Cork arigato
[05:31:34] <Cork> treeprogram: but simplest is to just check the generated json before its encoded, and make sure it contains what you need

[05:37:00] <evilgeenius> *easiest
[05:37:04] <Cork> evilgeenius: $(window).bind('scroll')
[05:37:12] <Cork> check scrollTop
[05:38:16] <evilgeenius> Cork: Won't checking scrollTop continuously when scrolling cause too much load?
[05:38:33] <Cork> evilgeenius: not really
[05:38:50] <evilgeenius> Cork:  k.  Thanks for the knowlege
[05:38:51] <Cork> just make sure to do as little work as possible, and you should be fine
[05:39:24] <Cork> window.scrollTop is more or less a direct variable access (not sure if its on window or document, you have to test that)
[05:39:51] <simpleweb> does anyone knows how  i can catch the value of all h3 elements?
[05:40:03] <Cork> evilgeenius: a tip though don't do alert(window.scrollTop) ;)
[05:40:14] <Cork> that's a really good way to hang your browser :D
[05:40:32] <Cork> simpleweb: you mean the text content?
[05:40:40] <simpleweb> yeah
[05:40:56] <Cork> var headers = $.map($('h3'), function() { return $(this).text(); })
[05:41:04] <Cork> damn sorry
[05:41:12] <Cork> var headers = $.map($('h3'), function(eln) { return $(elm).text(); })
[05:41:31] <simpleweb> I'll try thx :D
[05:41:33] <Cork> sigh.. and s/eln/elm/
[05:48:38] <simpleweb> how can i properly print the array i get back from this function? member:identifier:cork
[05:55:30] <seutje> depends what you mean by "properly" and by "print"
[05:56:47] <simpleweb> i did it...
[05:56:53] <simpleweb> but got another question
[05:57:25] <simpleweb> i do this: $('h3.ce_headline').text()
[05:58:19] <simpleweb> and i get back all titles but i would like to get them back single so i can edit them before print them

[06:57:54] <Myx0x3> trytrytry: use setInterval
[06:59:48] <bt9> cork: at least I think it was you earlier on
[07:00:20] <bt9> didn't realise jquery tools was so inactive, swapped out for jquery ui and animated tabs working fine now
[07:01:10] <trytrytry> Myx0x3: thanks :)
[07:04:28] <jacta> if I have a variable that contains seconds, right now it runs as a timer every second - is there a way to update another input field every time 54000 seconds is passed(15min)
[07:04:37] <jacta> like a timer that shows 15 mins interval
[07:07:17] <jacobroufa> hey room
[07:07:23] <BillCriswell> jacta: You mean setInterval?
[07:08:07] <jacta> BillCriswell, as it is right now it updates an hidden field every second, i was to update a text field with 0.25 hours interval(15 min)
[07:08:28] <jacobroufa> ive got a widget that loads in content via ajax and then initializes tabs on that content... and a setTimeout that fetches new data every 60s via ajax, in the same format/layout
[07:08:29] <jacta> so the seconds are allready up and running, but cant figure out to add 0.25 to text field
[07:08:42] <jacobroufa> problem is, when the new data comes in, the tabs break
[07:09:49] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.html widget http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/widget.js line 39 inits tabs
[07:10:07] <BillCriswell> 15 * 60 * 1000
[07:11:38] <BillCriswell> jacta: If I'm understanding right.
[07:11:41] <jacta> BillCriswell, but how can I make a script that can automaticly set it into textfield every 15 * 60 * 1000 seconds?
[07:11:57] <jacta> i can jsfiddle if you want a base?
[07:12:33] <BillCriswell> jacta: var update = setInterval(function(){ $.get(..); }, 15 * 60 * 1000 ); you mean?
[07:15:17] <FinalAngel> is there a way to travers within the same level to an element above the list: http://jsfiddle.net/Q9HCK/ I would like to get superparent-1 through the class or superparent-2 if its subitem-5 or 6?
[07:16:54] <jacta> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/sQeDW/ - so when 15 min is passed, it needs to add 0.25 to the first field - like a stopwatch with 15 mins interval
[07:19:51] <scar> it dont display?
[07:19:53] <scar> oops
[07:22:34] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/FMzK9/ how can make just  Show only the UL from the selected parent ?
[07:23:58] <xec_> FinalAngel: .prevAll() could probably do the job http://jsfiddle.net/Q9HCK/1/
[07:24:26] <BillCriswell> jacta: Sorry dude phone.
[07:24:45] <jacta> No problem at all, BillCriswell
[07:25:30] <FinalAngel> xec_: but than I get the problem if i switch to subitem-6 where I should get subparent-2
[07:25:41] <FinalAngel> xec_: playing with prevUntil atm
[07:26:27] <xec_> FinalAngel: what? subitem-6 does get superparent-2
[07:26:52] <xec_> did you see the demo?
[07:27:02] <FinalAngel> xec_: ah kay first() is the key :)
[07:27:19] <xec_> yes, as you only want the first match
[07:27:31] <FinalAngel> thanks!
[07:27:34] <xec_> np :)
[07:31:13] <jacta> BillCriswell, i can wait :)

[07:42:10] <jacobroufa> anyone here a .tabs() guru?
[07:42:43] <Pnoexz> jacobroufa: dont ask to ask, just ask
[07:43:02] <jacobroufa> lol i have asked a couple times to no avail
[07:43:05] <jacobroufa> but since you insist :p
[07:43:22] <jacobroufa> ive got tabs that break when i fetch new content via ajax
[07:43:59] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.html this works when i init the tabs after the first ajax, but when my setTimeout kicks in and my next ajax call happens, the tabs do not reinit
[07:44:08] <Absolute0> I need to redraw everything in a large into a much smaller div, scaling everything down. Is there a quick way of doing this, without manually iterating over all the elements and changed the css for each?
[07:44:26] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/widget.js line 39 is tabs init
[07:45:10] <jacobroufa> timer is 60s atm, so it doesnt break right away.
[07:45:15] <Pnoexz> Absolute0: tried using #thatDiv * {width:80%}?
[07:47:51] <jjb123> Hey everyone, quick question. So I'm trying to make an embeddable jQuery widget and I'm using this code: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2174733/401208 To keep it from interfering with the page. I was wondering if there's a way to include other external JS scripts from within this code so I don't have to put my whole widget in one file.
[07:47:53] <jjb123> Any ideas?
[07:48:10] <jacobroufa> Pnoexz - funny thing is, it doesnt pop any errors when it breaks
[07:48:13] <jjb123> The external JS scripts would still need to use the overloaded $ in the callback function
[07:51:34] <jacobroufa> jjb123 - make an array with your scripts' sources and run an $.each() to iterate through them and add them all.
[07:52:20] <jacobroufa> in the large if statement, all the code there can be applicable to any external script, only the source need change, so just put the each inside of that if
[07:52:23] <jjb123> jacabroufa: How would I add them? jQuery.getScript()?
[07:52:50] <jacobroufa> and set the source to the variable representing the array youre iterating over
[07:55:43] <jacta> BillCriswell, are you still not here?
[07:58:08] <jjb123> jacobroufa: Hum, I see. One of my extra scripts uses jQuery though. If I load the script up there, would it still use the overloaded $ operator from when I loaded jQuery (to not interfer with the page)? Also, that file only contains a class that the main script would need to use, so would the callback even need to be called?
[07:58:20] <jacta> Can anyone help me out with this: http://jsfiddle.net/sQeDW/
[07:58:21] <BillCriswell> jacta: Yeah, just got back. Sorry, that lady was brutal.
[07:58:35] <jacta> oh, now you have latest link :)
[07:58:40] <jacta> oooh, sorry to hear, are you okay? :(
[07:58:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah, she just wouldn't stop tlaking haha.
[07:58:59] <BillCriswell> jacta: http://jsfiddle.net/sQeDW/1/ like this?
[08:00:41] <jacta> princip seems correct, but aint it (15*60) instead of % 15?
[08:01:03] <jacta> its every 15 mins, am I right, but yep, seems like you have a good point, niiice though
[08:01:06] <jacobroufa> jjb123 - hrm
[08:01:25] <jacobroufa> jjb123 - i dont know that i looked close enough at that script.
[08:01:34] <jacobroufa> so all your scripts need to load after your version of jquery?
[08:03:04] <jacobroufa> load them in the same way i suggested, separate from the above function that loads your specific jquery ver, inside of the part that says "//Widget code here"
[08:03:15] <jacobroufa> but before your widget code
[08:03:33] <jacobroufa> that should work, and not interfere with your version of jquery
[08:04:11] <jjb123> jacobroufa: Yep. I have an existing script that I'm trying to make embeddable. Right now it consists of some HTML containers, jQuery, a jQuery plugin, a script to setup the interface, and a script to run the application. First I'll use jQuery to add the containers to the page, then the interface script will populate them, then the application script will take over.
[08:04:43] <jjb123> jacobroufa: Ah, yeah I was thinking that but I didn't know if the scripts would be loaded at the top level and use the normal $ (if it's present, i.e. if an old version of jQuery is loaded on the page)
[08:05:07] <jacobroufa> if youre inside the wrapper function, you should be using your own version of jquery
[08:05:15] <jacobroufa> $.fn.jquery
[08:05:18] <BillCriswell> jacta: Well yeah, but I didn't want to wait 15 minutes to see if my logic was right haha.
[08:05:38] <jacta> BillCriswell, good point, but you're so right :)
[08:05:42] <jacta> smart way btw
[08:06:00] <jacobroufa> jjb123 - log or alert that somewhere, if youre not sure which version of jquery youre using
[08:08:56] <jjb123> jacobroufa: Hum, yeah I think I can see how this would work.
[08:08:59] <jjb123> Thanks for your help!
[08:09:08] <jacobroufa> jjb123 - glad to help. good luck :)
[08:16:27] <RLa> jquery mobile does not apply stylesheet on ios 3.1.2 (oldest iphone)
[08:16:39] <RLa> Debug Console says No Errors
[08:17:06] <RLa> server log shows it fetches the stylesheet
[08:22:12] <BillCriswell> RLa: Are a lot of your users using that? Scary to think so.
[08:24:13] <RLa> BillCriswell, at the moment, 100%, doing this app for testing
[08:24:33] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[08:24:34] <RLa> BillCriswell, it just have no theme for iphone?
[08:33:46] <Forrestr> Why would my $("#process").modal("show"); from http://pastebin.com/SCUUDHvP still show even after I remove it from the click function? I also can't get it to hide even with the .ajaxComplete function, why would it be doing this?
[08:34:28] <saba> I need to window.open('/foo/', '_blank') inside a AJAX callback (success), however this might trigger many popup blockers. Thus I'm thinking of using a hidden <a> on the page, changing the attributes on that and .trigger(). Any suggestions on this subject? I have not dealed with many popup blockers before.
[08:34:55] <saba> in Chrome with my settings calling window.open () inside the callback opens a new window, calling window.open outside of the callback opens a new tab instead.
[08:37:04] <pifantastic> saba: calling .click() on an <a> will trigger attached event handlers, but I don't think it will actually "click" the link
[08:38:01] <saba> pifantastic: heh, you're absolutely right.
[08:38:19] <Taar779_w> pifantastic: is there a way around that?
[08:38:28] <pifantastic> saba: http://jsfiddle.net/Rswsn/1/
[08:38:38] <pifantastic> nope, that's there to prevent you guys from making the web awful
[08:38:42] <pifantastic> ;)
[08:39:42] <saba> pifantastic: I actually only need to open a window from an AJAX callback without having the browser to treat it different from a normal window.open(). Nothing bad about that.
[08:40:21] <RLa> BillCriswell, looks like jquery 1.8 does not work on old iphone
[08:40:23] <Taar779_w> pifantastic: personally I'm just trying to warn the user that they are leaving the page with unsaved changes. If they decide to leave the page than it should follow the link they just clicked.
[08:40:27] <pifantastic> saba: popping up a new window is *generally* bad UX
[08:40:36] <RLa> BillCriswell, switched to 1.7, now works
[08:40:52] <BillCriswell> RLa: That's rough. Wonder what the big difference is.
[08:41:12] <saba> pifantastic: generally yes, in case of a file download, no :-)
[08:41:14] <pifantastic> Taar779_w: you can use onbeforeunload
[08:41:17] <RLa> i thought support for old ies was dropped
[08:41:17] <pifantastic> ?onbeforeunload
[08:41:24] <bot-t> pifantastic, #12547 (window.onbeforeunload fires twice with IE8 under special ... - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12547
[08:41:29] <pifantastic> grr
[08:41:43] <pifantastic> Taar779_w: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[08:41:55] <NoiseEee> saba: target the file(download) to a newly created iframe
[08:42:18] <saba> NoiseEee: ah, of course! nice. Thanks :-)
[08:42:20] <cusco> hi
[08:43:06] <Taar779_w> pifantastic: I did look into that but one of the problems I had is firefox doesn't allow for custom messages. Therefore the user doesn't know why he/she is being asked if they like to leave the page.
[08:43:11] <cusco> Im using .appent() to add <tr><td>asd</td></tr> to a tabble, right?, now after that I'm declaring that table as a .dataTable() but the fields are not sorting... why?
[08:44:52] <saba> NoiseEee: works like a charm. Thanks again
[08:52:36] <aqeel> ok guys if i z-index the object and view in chrome it is not having any effect for the specified css...
[08:52:54] <aqeel> other browsers are ok
[08:53:25] <NoiseEee> np sab
[08:55:03] <MrPunkin> Anyone in here using Mustache.js / Hogan.js and have an opinion on how to trigger template-specific javascript after render? Kind of an afterRender callback, if you will?
[09:02:18] * zps {action text}
[09:02:34] <cusco> Im using .appent() to add <tr><td>asd</td></tr> to a tabble, right?, now after that I'm declaring that table as a .dataTable() but the fields are not sorting... why?
[09:04:14] <aqeel> in google chrome the loaded content into the object is making an extra layer laid on top of object but this behaviour is not happening in any other browser
[09:10:21] <army> hi guys, i ran into a little trouble here, have been trying to google it and checked documentation but was not successful yet. i have 3 ID's present in a document, and them i'm appending another set of div's to the document through .ajax()
[09:10:35] <army> now from the ones that i got, i don't want the div's with the already present IDs to be appended
[09:11:02] <army> i already managed to create the array with the present ids
[09:11:18] <army> but how can i filter out all elements from a .find() result before calling .appendTo ?
[09:11:34] <army> *all elements that match any of the IDs in the array
[09:11:56] <aqeel> use recursion
[09:12:40] <aqeel> well all elements any of the ids.....are your ids specific if not i rather say choose class
[09:13:00] <aqeel> only one speciic id per element
[09:13:07] <aqeel> else make use of class
[09:13:07] <army> it's the monthly headlines, so yeah, each of them is called December, November, etc
[09:13:13] <army> id='December'
[09:13:29] <army> and i don't want the headlines to be duplicated, however if they are not present, i want them shown
[09:14:18] <aqeel> how exactly are you calling on this....are these in seperate external file
[09:14:40] <army> var ids = []; $jQ("#list .date").each(function(){ ids.push(this.id); });$jQ(data).find('#list .item, #list .date').appendTo('#list');
[09:14:51] <army> i'm sorry, pressed enter by accident
[09:15:04] <army> getting it from an external ajax call
[09:15:12] <army> GET call
[09:16:17] <aqeel> is there anything already shown or are you populating all by ajax
[09:16:25] <army> yes it's shown already
[09:16:36] <army> it's a basic html page, and this is what happens when you 'load more'
[09:16:38] <aqeel> is the div empty first then loads via ajax
[09:16:44] <army> it's already filled
[09:18:41] <army> i could also switch from ids to class names if that's more convenient
[09:18:58] <aqeel> no in this case id is better
[09:19:18] <army> something like going through classes with name december and hiding every one after the first
[09:19:19] <army> aha okay
[09:20:21] <aqeel> class are used if u have common denominator
[09:22:43] <army> so any idea how to filter them out?
[09:24:47] <xiam> so I've been working on this plugin, what do you think? http://jsfoo.org
[09:34:30] <josefig> how can I set this for IE support? http://pastie.org/5335889
[09:35:37] <evilgeenius> Is it easy to count the number of the checked check boxes that have class 'checker' using jquery?
[09:35:45] <evilgeenius> Is it easy to count the number of checked check boxes that have class 'checker' using jquery?
[09:36:27] <getsetbro_> yes it is easy to count the number of checked check boxes that have class 'checker' using jquery?
[09:37:08] <jacobroufa> evilgeenius - $('input.checker').length;
[09:37:20] <shoky> forgot :checked
[09:37:35] <evilgeenius> jacobroufa: but how many of them have been checked?
[09:37:40] <jacobroufa> evilgeenius - $('input:checked.checker').length;
[09:37:48] <jacobroufa> shoky - thx
[09:37:50] <getsetbro_> $(".checker:checked").length;
[09:37:55] <evilgeenius> jacobroufa: u beauty
[09:38:53] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.html my widget tabs break after new data is fed via ajax
[09:38:58] <jacobroufa> anyone care to help?
[09:39:21] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/widget.js line 39 is tabs init
[09:44:14] <jacobroufa> anybody? bueller?
[09:44:26] <MistuhKurtz> restate the question good sir
[09:44:53] <shoky> jacobroufa: what's this supposed to do?  .done(widget, self.init())
[09:45:32] <jacobroufa> in my widget, i have an ajax function that populates a template. on that first ajax call, tabs are initialized. then a setTimeout runs so that every X seconds new data is fetched. when the new data is fetched, tabs are reinitialized but they dont work.
[09:45:36] <jacobroufa> so they break
[09:46:07] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[09:46:08] <jacobroufa> shoky - it calls the widget and then reinits the setTimeout, respectively, when the data is fetched.
[09:46:15] <MistuhKurtz> create a jsfiddle and I'd be happy to look at it.
[09:46:38] <shoky> jacobroufa:  self.init() is the return value  of calling self.init
[09:46:48] <shoky> jacobroufa: i think you meant just 'self.init' ?
[09:47:52] <shoky> jacobroufa: anyway, try:  $('#results').tabs('destroy').html(template(json)).tabs().addClass(...
[09:50:53] <jacobroufa> shoky, that gets me "cannot call methods on tabs prior to initialization"
[09:51:27] <jacobroufa> MistuhKurtz - http://jsfiddle.net/nfcrt/
[09:53:06] <shoky> oh the same line also does the first initialization?  uhh then.. var r = $('#results'); if (r.is('.ui-tabs')) r.tabs('destroy');  r.html(..).tabs().addClass..
[09:54:26] <shoky> or just use a flag.. whatever
[09:55:12] <jacobroufa> shoky - you genius :)
[09:55:35] <shoky> ;]

[10:14:37] <csehl> im loading pages with jQuery's load. It works for everyone so far, there is only one company having some network hardware that is throwing a network error on ajax loads. any clues where i could start to search? were talking about ordinary jQuery.load() into a div here
[10:15:39] <getsetbro_> I have a single page web app with jQuery Mobile. If you open it with a hash at the end it will browse to that "page" - my.com/index.html#pageThree - how do i disable that but make sure the back button keep working?
[10:16:05] <firstclassfunc> how can I force jquery to show errors? When I do $.getScript(...) it doesn't throw an error if the URL isn't found
[10:18:30] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/hXjsiCLG this works fine, but how can I make the dialog box hidden ? I want to make it visible with a function
[10:20:05] <vacho> ajpiano: how u doin?
[10:24:03] <vacho> anyone? :)(
[10:29:17] <YammYcoding> hi guys. I have a page with some text in portuguese then i want to add the same text in english, is there any jquery trick I could use to add two flag icons, and hide one and show another on the same page?
[10:29:41] <firstclassfunc> how can I force jquery to show errors? When I do $.getScript(...) it doesn't throw an error if the URL isn't found
[10:31:53] <aqeel> vacho .hide() and .show()
[10:32:09] <keirlav87>  i have an app made with slim that uses alot of ajax calls, and I have a middleware function that checks requests to the ajax routes using isAjax() method - what would be a good status code to return if a call is made to the ajax routes by non-ajax means?
[10:32:40] <aqeel> or css...display hidden at first and with function display block or something....or use .show()
[10:34:07] <sg> hi hi
[10:34:48] <vacho> aqeel: no..seems like dialog calls show automatically..even if i hide it it shows.
[10:36:01] <ajpiano> vacho: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-autoOpen
[10:36:27] <vacho> ajpiano: that's what I was looking at.. but how do I pass that? I am loading dialog in a wierd way because the content i through ajax...can u look?
[10:36:33] <vacho> I dont' know where exacly to pass those vars.
[10:37:32] <sg> why doesn't jQuery mobile apply styles from new pages that it loads with ajax?
[10:37:41] <sg> and how can i get said styles to be applied
[10:38:01] <ajpiano> vacho: when you initialisee the dialog
[10:38:07] <ajpiano> .dialog({autoOpen: false});
[10:43:16] <vacho> ajpiano: don't laugh: http://pastebin.com/EthDUqdL
[10:43:54] <ajpiano> what am i supposed to be looking at here
[10:46:01] <someprimetime> damn that formatting
[10:46:16] <someprimetime> spread out like whoa
[10:46:42] <vacho> ajpiano: 	$( "#dialog" ).dialog({ 		autoOpen: false,
[10:46:56] <ajpiano> vacho: that should work
[10:46:57] <vacho> I think I know!! give me a sec.
[10:49:03] <vacho> ajpiano: please look at line 9, http://pastebin.com/9vQ1P4m9 .. when I remove "open" as parameter, it does in fact not show the dialog box, but how do I open it at a later time?? currently, it's there and hidden..how do I make it visible?
[10:50:27] <firstclassfunc>  function existsInWindow(variable) { return this[variable] !== undefined }   // How do you make this work?
[10:53:36] <slikts> are there any examples of publishing widgets both as standalone and using jquery ui?
[10:53:41] <fission6> anyone have a rec for transforming youtube links to embeded videos?
[10:54:23] <ajpiano> vacho: i legitimately have no idea what you're asking and am very busy
[10:54:37] <ajpiano> .dialog("open") opens an instantiated dialog, "close" does the opposite
[10:54:44] <ajpiano> and autoOpen exists, i thought you were unaware of it.
[10:54:47] <ajpiano> i can't debug right now
[10:56:25] <vacho> last line (9), when I don't pass the "open" parameter, it does not display the dialog box, which is what I want.. I wan't to open it later in the code..how do I call it again to open it?
[10:56:40] <vacho> opss, sorry..nevermind then ajp! thanks
[10:57:29] <NackNick> is there a way to remove a character in a input field once its been entered?
[10:57:49] <NackNick> im trying to do a areacode validation and idiots keep putting 1 as the 1st number -_-
[10:58:40] <catcher> NackNick, sure, you can manipulate fields with .val()
[10:59:29] <NackNick> yeah i figured val would be the 1st place to start but is there something that says if val == 1 clear input field?
[10:59:36] <NackNick> better yet
[10:59:50] <NackNick> if val and 1st character == 1 clear input field
[10:59:55] <catcher> NackNick, that 'something' is your code.
[11:00:30] <NackNick> is there a function to clear the input field?
[11:00:45] <catcher> yep, .val()
[11:00:46] <catcher> :)
[11:00:54] <catcher> just set it to blank
[11:01:00] <catcher> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:01:16] <NackNick> for a sec i was confused, but your right
[11:04:01] <MistuhKurtz> $("input").on('blur', function(e){ var first = $(this).val().slice(0,1); if(first == 1){ /* do stuff */ }  });
[11:04:09] <MistuhKurtz> NackNick,
[11:04:51] <NackNick> is it better to have blur or keypress?
[11:05:07] <Teduardo> is there an easy way to show <div id=stuff></div> when a user clicks on a text link with <a id=stuff> otherwise just hide <div id=stuff>?
[11:05:42] <fission6> anyone?
[11:05:42] <NoiseEee> Teduardo: but elements aren't allowed to have duplicate IDs
[11:05:46] <MistuhKurtz> personally I use jQuery Validate for my forms so I would probably create a custom validation method and let the plugin handle showing the error and stuff
[11:06:27] <MistuhKurtz> NackNick, I wouldn't manipulate the value on keypress or change, that's disorienting UX
[11:06:48] <MistuhKurtz> you could show the error on the change event, just not manipulate the value
[11:07:02] <Teduardo> NoiseEee: okay so what if the div was called stuff1 and the link was called stuff?
[11:07:10] <NackNick> hmm, ok thanks
[11:07:15] <MistuhKurtz> but it sounds like you're trying to build fault tolerance (automatically strip any leading 1s) rather than alerting the user of their error
[11:07:17] <NoiseEee> Teduardo: "called" ?
[11:07:43] <NackNick> yeah, i was going to use the alert but theres enough of them on here
[11:08:09] <MistuhKurtz> you could use that little line of code i wrote for the basis of a quick one-off, but again I would recommend using this plugin, especially if you're validating multiple fields: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[11:08:26] <NoiseEee> Teduardo: a good way would be to use the html5 "data-" attribute to connect the two.  <div id='rockMe'></div>  <a href='#' data-divid='rockMe'>show the div</a>
[11:09:01] <NackNick> normally i would use the plugin but its just this one field that need validation
[11:09:57] <NoiseEee> Teduardo: that lets you do something like:  $('a').on('click',function() { $('#'+$(this).attr('data-id')).show() });
[11:10:35] <MistuhKurtz> Teduardo, you can do <a href="#stuff" /> <div id="stuff"> $('a').click(function(e){ var target = $(this).attr('href'); $(target).show(); });
[11:11:09] <catcher> NackNick, if I were you, I'd bind it to the submit button click event.  The user is better off not knowing it's happening, if I understand your situation right.
[11:11:51] <MistuhKurtz> NackNick, and if catcher is right in how you want to handle it, it would then be best left to your server-side form processor
[11:11:59] <catcher> also true
[11:13:52] <NackNick> hmm
[11:14:41] <MistuhKurtz> although I don't think it's uncommon to have an input correct the formatting as soon as blur
[11:14:49] <fission6> anyone have a youtube link to embed snippet
[11:17:13] <Teduardo> MistuhKurtz: Wouldn't that match anytime any link was clicked?
[11:17:46] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, it's just a piece of example code
[11:17:58] <MistuhKurtz> it's up to you to hone your selectors etc. so that it works for you
[11:18:25] <MistuhKurtz> it's easier when discussing problems to isolate and simplify them and not get caught up in unnecessary details
[11:19:27] <personne> hi I want to add some CSS to a div with Jquery like that: $("#"+elmt).css("background-image" , "linear-gradient("+hex+","+$('#test2').val()+")" );  but i want to set all the possibilities like 	background-image:-moz-linear-gradient(green, blue); /* Firefox */ & same for chrome safari... how to?
[11:21:40] <personne> someone can help me?
[11:23:24] <blink> Hello could some tell me how can i strip all the html tags as soon as i paste it in the textarea ? this is what i have now http://jsfiddle.net/mekBn/
[11:24:10] <blink> it prevents when typing it in but when you paste it, it wont remove them
[11:30:19] <mg983> Hi guys. I'm having a really weird issue on a site I am working on, only in chrome (not in safari either). If you load http://popdust.com/2012/11/06/beyonce-jay-z-hurricane-sandy-new-york-angels-generator/ in firefox and scroll down the page, a sharebox appears and follows you down. If you load the same page in chrome, the sharebox pops up and doesn't follow you until
[11:30:34] <mg983> you are much lower on the screen, but if you follow the CSS it *should* be following me all along (position:fixed, top:280px;) --- what's bizarre is if you use inspector and remove the position:fixed and readd it it appears where it should be. can someone take a look and see if i am missing something or if this is a weird bug?
[11:32:59] <someprimetime> boy i think dey like boy boy i think dey like me
[11:33:44] <someprimetime> @mg983 put a float on it
[11:33:44] <b-ot> someprimetime, definitely being used as one ;)
[11:34:11] <someprimetime> b-ot: i don't know if you are some kind of bot-t impersonator but i don't know if i like it yet
[11:34:11] <b-ot> someprimetime, no YOU ARE some kind of bot-t impersonator but i don't know if i like it yet
[11:35:16] <mg983> someprimetime: doesn't help
[11:35:27] <mg983> someprimetime: i added float:left to it...
[11:35:47] <someprimetime> can you post a fiddle?
[11:36:04] <therealklanni> Anyone know off the top of your head how jQuery is handling click vs dblclick events? As in, not responding to a click when it's actually a double click?
[11:36:19] <mg983> someprimetime: it's a full site unfortunately, it would be almost impossible to replicate... i've been using the inspector to troubleshoot it
[11:36:26] <therealklanni> Because in standard dom events click will fire even if the event is technically dblclick
[11:36:52] <therealklanni> So both events fire
[11:38:01] <blink> are there any on paste events ?
[11:38:03] <someprimetime> you can't handle a click event and a doubleclick event on the same target i believe
[11:38:07] <someprimetime> it's one or the other
[11:38:24] <therealklanni> blink: use change or keyup
[11:38:35] <someprimetime> mg983: not sure sorry i can't really go in and debug that since i'm @work
[11:38:57] <therealklanni> someprimetime: false
[11:39:03] <someprimetime> well you can
[11:39:06] <slash_nick> I'm afraid i'm misusing event.target and would like to understand it better https://gist.github.com/4026881 .. alert("I blurred!") doesn't fire (i'd like it to)
[11:39:07] <someprimetime> but how will you decide which one it is?
[11:39:14] <therealklanni> someprimetime: I have events for both, but I don't want click to fire when it registers as dblclick
[11:39:16] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.onpaste @ blink
[11:39:28] <someprimetime> well that's just a bad design
[11:39:33] <blink> therealklanni i tried but it wont work only onkeyp works one moment
[11:40:14] <someprimetime> click will fire first before doubleclick obviously. you could set a variable to true and false depending if two clicks have been registered
[11:40:22] <therealklanni> blink: change is a "blur" event so that's why I suggested either/or usually people trying to check for pasting want to immediately register it, but keyup can get expensive quick
[11:40:31] <blink> http://jsfiddle.net/mekBn/ try to type < > in the textarea it works but something like that but on paste event
[11:40:41] <therealklanni> someprimetime: I'm not asking how to handle it, reread my question :)
[11:41:24] <therealklanni> someprimetime: I already know how to differentiate the events. I was asking if anyone knew how jQuery was doing it before I check the source. I'm just trying to see if jQuery's method is better.
[11:41:53] <blink> therealklanni http://jsfiddle.net/mekBn/1/ its not working
[11:42:54] <yeahdef> Hi, would this be a good place to ask a question about the jquery validation plugin?
[11:42:57] <someprimetime> therealklanni: http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[11:43:24] <therealklanni> I'm not acutally using jQuery, I'm just "comparing notes"
[11:43:33] <someprimetime> lol then read that
[11:43:36] <someprimetime> it'll tell you everything you need
[11:44:14] <therealklanni> someprimetime: that actually doesn'
[11:44:20] <therealklanni> t tell me ANYTHING I asked lol
[11:44:43] <therealklanni> You're not understanding the question
[11:44:46] <someprimetime> it didn't tell you anything because you didn't attempt to read it
[11:44:47] <therealklanni> Thanks anyway
[11:44:54] <someprimetime> This method is a shortcut for .bind('dblclick', handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger('dblclick') in the third. The dblclick event is sent to an element when the element is double-clicked. Any HTML element can receive this event. For example, consider the HTML:
[11:45:32] <therealklanni> someprimetime: I have read it already. Look dude, you aren't understanding my questions and your persistence is just wasting my time, so I'm going to just ignore you now
[11:45:43] <someprimetime> ok idiot
[11:45:49] <NackNick> Oo
[11:45:51] <KWhat_Work> Are event listeners called asynchronously?
[11:45:57] <someprimetime> if you aren't using jquery why would you for one event method?
[11:45:57] <therealklanni> I'm not using jQuery, genius
[11:46:11] <someprimetime> go ahead and reinvent the wheel
[11:46:40] <KWhat_Work> therealklanni: now I am curious, what are you doing
[11:47:07] <NackNick> reinventing the wheel
[11:48:08] <therealklanni> KWhat_Work: I am working with Google Maps API, they have their own click event handlers, hence no jQuery. I am just using a method of my own design to differentiate my click events from my double click events on the same element. I only wanted to "compare notes" with jQuery's method of differentiation to see if there is a more efficient way.
[11:48:45] <therealklanni> Referencing the jQuery API docs (which I am already quite familiar with) doesn't tell me anything about what I want to know. :)
[11:48:58] <someprimetime> sounds like he just needs to namespace his events
[11:49:00] <KWhat_Work> i would suggest reading the src
[11:49:03] <someprimetime> dblclick.mine
[11:49:42] <therealklanni> KWhat_Work: that was my intent, I merely threw out a "hey does anyone know __ off the top of your head" but then *some people* misread that and ran with it
[11:49:45] <KWhat_Work> someprimetime: based on what he just said that is not the correct answer
[11:50:01] <therealklanni> lol
[11:50:04] <therealklanni> Thank you
[11:51:15] <joflow> Hi all. I'm close to tearing my hair out - seems i'm having a conflict with Jquery UI and another library I'm loading. I've looked into the no_conflict options but they are probably not what I need in this case. I'm loading this library here -> https://github.com/andreassolberg/jso/blob/master/jso.js and Firebug ends up spitting 'TypeError: $.oajax is not a function'. Anyone ?
[11:52:04] <KWhat_Work> therealklanni: Start digging: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js  Only person that would be able to give you any useful info would be a developer and this is not really a dev channel.
[11:52:15] <therealklanni> Anyway, thanks (to those of you who took the time to ask for more clarification on my original questions instead of trying to draw your own conclusions about what I'm trying to do) for trying
[11:52:41] <therealklanni> KWhat_Work: yeah, it was a shot in the dark :)
[11:53:01] <slash_nick> I'm afraid i'm misusing event.target and would like to understand it better: https://gist.github.com/4026881 ... can someone take a look at this and see if they can help a bit?
[11:55:59] <MistuhKurtz> slash_nick, for stuff like that you should set it up on jsfiddle so people can play around with it
[11:57:30] <blink> therealklanni can you help me fix this please http://jsfiddle.net/mekBn/2/ or anyone thats free
[11:57:30] <slash_nick> k one sec
[11:57:46] <blink> i just want to prevent all html tags on paste
[11:57:55] <NoiseEee> blink: many things wrong; for one, choose jquery in the library
[11:58:00] <NoiseEee> blink: for two, dump the inline JS
[11:58:10] <blink> ok
[11:59:15] <NoiseEee> blink: for three, what is if ( text ) supposed to do
[12:00:00] <joflow> anyone that could help me with my conflict issue ?
[12:00:03] <blink> NoiseEee i thought.text("" ) this prevents the html tags
[12:00:08] <blink> that jquery function
[12:00:27] <blink> and i just assigned variable to it and if it is true execude the code
[12:00:30] <NoiseEee> but what exactly are you testing for blink?
[12:00:35] <NoiseEee> if whats true?
[12:00:53] <blink> that function to prevent all html tags
[12:01:03] <NoiseEee> blink: prevent all html tags?
[12:01:07] <blink> like when you paste something it removes the html tags automatically
[12:01:09] <blink> yes
[12:01:17] <NoiseEee> blink: what are you trying to do?
[12:01:54] <blink> i have an output from ajax and it shows the textarea or buttons whatever i write in html format
[12:02:00] <blink> so i want to prevent it
[12:02:09] <blink> it works for the server side
[12:02:24] <blink> but i want to prevent on the browser side also
[12:02:35] <blink> so not allowing anyone using <>
[12:03:05] <blink> im super worry about security always
[12:03:16] <NoiseEee> blink: your onkeyup seems to do that already
[12:03:28] <NoiseEee> blink: and nothing matters until the backend anyways
[12:04:01] <blink> yes thats true but people still can paste the code and it will execute those script during that time when it shows when submitting ajax
[12:04:24] <NoiseEee> i tried pasting <blink> into it, it stripped it out... and what do you mean "execute" ?
[12:04:48] <NoiseEee> where/how is anything being executed?
[12:05:16] <blink> execute i mean when i write <textarea> </textarea> i dont want them to see that actull textarea when submitting the form
[12:05:34] <blink> but rather make them see textarea texatrea
[12:05:47] <NoiseEee> i don't follow
[12:07:11] <blink> http://jsfiddle.net/mekBn/3/ it does not remove it when pasting
[12:07:28] <keebler> Trying to apply a css class to a specifc JSON value. if(value != "I"){ $("#clk").addClass("clocked");} Yet, it only applies it to the first itteration of that value, not to the remaining 12 matching.
[12:07:41] <keebler> This is all inside a jQuery xTemplate.
[12:07:58] <Forrestr> Why would my $("#process").modal("show"); from http://pastebin.com/SCUUDHvP still show even after I remove it from the click function? I also can't get it to hide even with the .ajaxComplete function, why would it be doing this?
[12:09:46] <slash_nick> Hey guys... trying to overcome my lack of understanding of `event.target` and `this`... here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rthbound/YmK65/2/ :)
[12:12:17] <rakl> I have a list of elements and I want to key through them using up/down arrows. Is there a pseudo element/state I can target for styling the element I'm currently on?
[12:12:20] <rakl> Something like li:hover, but for keys
[12:12:55] <rakl> Or better question, how do I target an element that's selected by keying through
[12:13:09] <slash_nick> something like "addClass('active')" on focus, "removeClass('active')" on blur?
[12:13:34] <slash_nick> err... that was to rakl ^
[12:13:51] <rakl> yeah i think so
[12:14:37] <blink> i never thought that removing html tags on paste can be so diffrent than onkeyup
[12:15:53] <slash_nick> rakl: just do that then? $("li").focus(function(){ $(this).addClass('active')}).blur(functio(){ $(this).removeClass('active') })
[12:17:14] <slash_nick> rakl: definitely a typo in there sorry
[12:18:44] <slash_nick> regarding event.target... anyone know where I can find documentation on its methods/functions?
[12:20:16] <rakl> thanks slash_nick, i think our problem is a little deeper than that, i'm realizing now. taking a quick break, i'll ask again in half an hour or so
[12:20:34] <slash_nick> ok rakl
[12:21:56] <kristofers> i created a function in a file and included it on my index file but when trying to use the function my button using onclick="formData()" i get a ReferenceError: formData is not defined
[12:25:07] <firstclassfunc> let's say I want to use getScript to get a script, do wahtever, then remove any trace of that script and its variables. whats the best way to do so?
[12:26:02] <blink120> sorry dc
[12:26:33] <slash_nick> if anyone's trying to help with that fiddle i posted... nevermind, i got it. thanks.
[12:27:12] <retrostyle|15> hi guys
[12:28:09] <keebler> Figured out the solution on my own using an if statement in xtemplate. 				{{if tech.clocked =="I"}}
[12:28:12] <retrostyle|15> anyone knows a best practice for page hendling
[12:28:12] <keebler> shit
[12:28:15] <keebler> 				<p class="clockedin">${tech.clocked} </p>
[12:28:16] <keebler> damn right click
[12:28:19] <keebler> 				{{/if}}
[12:28:30] <pags> keebler: stick to cookies
[12:29:19] <keebler> pags: mmm, I need to make some. Wish my company wasn't forcing us to use xtemplates.
[12:46:45] <goddard> how can i get two variables out of a response variable on an ajax call
[12:47:22] <seich-> what are you receiving?
[12:50:23] <goddard> Seich: i am using php and ajax
[12:50:30] <goddard> I want to send two variables
[12:50:53] <Seich> goddard: you could send json from the server
[12:51:25] <goddard> ok so i use json_econde for php side and then my "response" variable in jquery how can i access that?
[12:51:33] <goddard> response['blah'] ?
[12:51:44] <Seich> goddard: yeah, basically
[12:51:55] <Seich> goddard: it's usually better to go with the dot though
[12:52:04] <goddard> oh ok
[12:52:05] <Seich> like: response.blah
[12:52:09] <Seich> but it's the same
[12:56:20] <goddard> cool cool let me test it out
[12:59:21] <sx> if I have a listener: $(document).on('click', 'div', function(){ //etc..});    and then I add 1000 divs
[12:59:36] <sx> will this create 1000 listeners (ie potentially lag really bad)
[13:00:32] <shoky> sx: no that's only one single event listener
[13:00:54] <sx> so it would be trivial how many divs I add to the page?
[13:00:58] <sx> for performance
[13:01:03] <shoky> on every click on any element, it will check if the clicked element is a div, and if so, run your handler
[13:01:09] <shoky> yeah
[13:01:14] <sx> awesome
[13:07:02] <goddard> Seich: i sent this with my php script {"test1":"test1","test2":"test2"}
[13:07:21] <goddard> and my variable is response and i did a console.log(response.test1) and it was undefined
[13:07:32] <shoky> and console.log(response) ?
[13:07:39] <Seich> goddard: try console.log(response)
[13:08:21] <FrameFever> how can I check if an image is visible to the user?
[13:10:02] <Seich> FrameFever: as in, is in the screen? or has loaded?
[13:10:39] <goddard> Seich: it returned {"test1":"test1","test2":"test2"}
[13:11:01] <Seich> goddard: is it a string? or an actual json object?
[13:12:04] <FrameFever> Seich: on the screen
[13:12:28] <FrameFever> I have a container div, where I have several images put int
[13:12:48] <FrameFever> not all images in the container are visible
[13:13:00] <goddard> Seich: i do a json_encode with php
[13:13:01] <FrameFever> because of overlow:hidden
[13:13:12] <goddard> Seich: do i need to do something else?
[13:13:13] <shoky> goddard: use dataType:'json'  or .getJSON, or have your php send the right content-type header
[13:13:24] <FrameFever> how can I do a check now?
[13:13:34] <shoky> goddard: or just $.parseJSON(response)
[13:14:05] <keebler> What would be the "proper" way to do an alert() in jQuery? Or are alert(),confirm(),submit() still acceptable jquery/html5 modal uses?
[13:14:51] * keebler is just now getting into jquery/html5 after a web-dev hiatus of 10 years.
[13:15:10] <shoky> there's no proper way.. and jquery adds nothing to the mix
[13:15:47] <shoky> and submit() has nothing to do with the other two
[13:15:49] <keebler> Well, jquery plugin solutions like knockout or such. I know it's all just javascript.
[13:16:05] <shoky> knockout has nothing to do with jquery, and isn't a plugin..
[13:16:11] <Seich> keebler: It's fine to use them
[13:16:17] <shoky> so, donno what you're asking about
[13:16:39] <Seich> They are not as asthetically pleaseant though
[13:16:54] <FrameFever> does anybody know how to do it?
[13:17:05] <Seich> so you can easily get a plugin or make one to get some control over how it looks
[13:17:11] <relipse> http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=32772.0
[13:17:28] <Seich> FrameFever: You could so some math I guess
[13:17:41] <Seich> get the element's scrolling position
[13:17:51] <Seich> and the windows height
[13:18:10] <Seich> that way you can calculate if it's currently in view
[13:18:13] <keebler> shoky: Just trying to make sense of what the current young guys are saying here at work that using alerts/confirms are antiquated and will be deprecated eventually. But all I can find that is to be debrecated are the use of modal windows in general.
[13:18:44] <FrameFever> Seich: I thought there is some general solution for this problem
[13:18:55] <FrameFever> but yeah, I can do it my self
[13:19:06] <Seich> FrameFever: I don't think there is... :| perhaps a plugin like waypoints
[13:19:07] <someprimetime> alerts and confirms being deprecated? says who?
[13:19:10] <shoky> keebler: alert() just does what it does, it's very simple. you can pop up your own elements instead.. those will probably look nicer and won't block the browser/javascript like an alert() does
[13:19:13] <Seich> FrameFever: or something along those lines
[13:19:15] <someprimetime> buncha noobs i'd bet
[13:20:08] <Bauer1> guys, I have a simple html form submission (with jquery mobile loaded) - when I submit the form, I get 'undefined' message, even though checking the response of the request, it returns proper HTML code with the call to jquery mobile JS files, why? is that not a valid jquery mobile HTML?
[13:20:37] <someprimetime> wut
[13:20:37] <b-ot> For some reason this doesn't sign in when I barely start using it and when i try to go to it and it isn't signed it, I can't sign in on that page.
[13:21:40] <Bauer1> someprimetime: I mean my problem is like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7787461/why-am-i-seeing-a-value-of-undefined-on-screen-when-i-submit-form-in-jquery-mo except including jquery mobile loader in the HEAD of the response page, isnt solving the "undefined" error
[13:21:44] <keebler> someprimetime: I think they were just talking about modal in general, but when I mentioned using alerts they scoffed and went on about how it's poor/improper now to use them. Since I'm new to all these new ways to write simple html, I'm just trying to do my homework. Last time I wrote anything of worth, CSS2 was just starting to be implmented in phoenix(what is now Firefox).
[13:22:10] <shoky> it's not improper if what you want is an alert (with all that comes with that)
[13:22:30] <someprimetime> keebler: tell them that they are noobs and everything has a purpose
[13:22:30] <shoky> it's only improper in a certain context , for example if you care about UI :)
[13:22:37] <someprimetime> i still use confirms
[13:22:59] <Seich> if you are using them for what they should be used, then you are fine.
[13:23:34] <keebler> Well, the only thing I'll really need is to use a confirm. We're working on some mobile apps and I'm coming from a hardware C background trying to work on UI to interact with my programs.
[13:24:27] <someprimetime> when you use a confirm on mobile, it'll use the native prompt which is nice
[13:24:30] <someprimetime> i belive?
[13:24:36] <keebler> They're using xtemplates too, which from my understanding HAVE been deprecated by jsRender?
[13:24:36] <someprimetime> i don't do native apps so i couldn't care less
[13:24:44] <keebler> someprimetime: yes. it does
[13:24:54] <shoky> if your site does anything in the background (e.g. some ajax polling some server every N seconds).. an alert/confirm can block those
[13:25:08] <keebler> tons of ajax
[13:25:46] <keebler> But the only real alert is on first-load before any real ajax is run.
[13:26:10] <keebler> I'm trying to replace it though with a dialog with manipulatable content.
[13:26:21] <keebler> manipulative
[13:26:39] <shoky> lol.
[13:37:33] <qbmaniac> Hi all
[13:37:34] <bot-t> (576 hours ago) <coldhead> tell qbmaniac I will never forget you
[13:37:44] <qbmaniac> D:
[13:38:41] <qbmaniac> Does anyone know if there is a function in JQuery to run X function only once after Y element is inserted (created) in the DOM?
[13:38:57] <qbmaniac> I'm not talking about .live, .bind or .on
[13:39:07] <qbmaniac> because those bind an event to a selector
[13:40:01] <qbmaniac> what I want is that, say, 5 seconds after the page is loaded suddenly a <div class="test"></div> appears in the document. I want JQuery to go AHA! when .test appears, and do an alert("here you are");
[13:40:32] <YammYcoding> is function() the same as function () ?
[13:40:37] <qbmaniac> yep
[13:40:45] <YammYcoding> ah okey just checking =)
[13:40:50] <tw2113> except for the space
[13:40:56] <tw2113> that's a bit different, otherwise, the same
[13:41:02] <qbmaniac> haha
[13:42:47] <qbmaniac> Does anyone have an idea on how to solve my query?
[13:43:13] <qbmaniac> Sorry about being a pain in the arse, but I've had this question for years now with no solution
[13:45:43] <NoiseEee> qbmaniac: http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion
[13:46:04] <onekt> years :)  ?
[13:46:23] <qbmaniac> Literally
[13:46:32] <qbmaniac> Thanks NoiseEee exactly what I was looking for.
[13:46:33] <NoiseEee> qbmaniac: related http://www.backalleycoder.com/2012/04/25/i-want-a-damnodeinserted/
[13:46:42] <qbmaniac> So, does bind, on, or live not do any of this then?
[13:46:49] <KWhat_Work> Why does preventDefault() need to be called before anything else?  Are events now being delivered async ?
[13:46:55] <NoiseEee> no, literally the only thing dependable is a css animation hack
[13:46:56] <qbmaniac> I would have thought JQuery would have a handler for this
[13:47:07] <NoiseEee> qbmaniac: jquery can't handle it if the browsers cant
[13:47:47] <qbmaniac> damn, oh well, thanks NoiseEee
[13:53:40] <rideh> what's the proper way to do this: $('.delete').onclick(function(){captureID=this.id;}); ?
[13:54:46] <rideh> dynamically created elements - i am making delete buttons with an id set to a unique id for each element. how do I use the value of the id?
[13:55:22] <KWhat_Work> use the id attribute?
[13:55:34] <rideh> KWhat_Work: yes
[13:55:35] <shoky> jquery don't got .onclick
[13:55:43] <NoiseEee> $('#commonParentToDynamicallyAddedItems').on('click','.delete',function() { console.log($(this).prop('id')); });
[13:55:49] <rideh> yeah sorry bout that
[13:56:18] <rideh> NoiseEee: thanks thats exactly it. so .prop lets me grab value of any attribute?
[13:56:20] <shoky> this.id didn't work..?
[13:56:35] <NoiseEee> rideh: a property
[13:56:59] <tlkr> $(this).prop('id');
[13:57:38] <mib_mib> hi guys, if i have a script1.js that has a document.ready() statement, and then i load another script scrip2.js that has another document.ready() statement, will the  document ready in script1 always run before the document ready in script 2?
[13:57:45] <rideh> ok thanks guys
[13:58:43] <KWhat_Work> mib_mib: i dont think its guaranteed but more than likely yes
[13:58:45] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[13:59:15] <mib_mib> what does that mean? are you saying that there are race conditions or not?
[14:00:05] <KWhat_Work> I am saying browsers load stuff top down, but there is nothing described by the w3c that says they must do that.
[14:00:40] <KWhat_Work> mib_mib: it would be a race condition if file 1 takes 10 ms to load and file 2 takes 5ms to load
[14:01:13] <mib_mib> KWhat_Work: are you sure? doesn't the browser execute the javascript in order that its included?
[14:01:24] <KWhat_Work> ummm let me double check the standard
[14:03:14] <snover> scripts are executed in document order, always, unless you add the async attribute.
[14:03:27] <mib_mib> KWhat_Work: i'm not sure either
[14:03:55] <snover> i know, what i just said was very confusing
[14:04:28] <rideh> NoiseEee: i'm getting unexpcted token this with $(this)
[14:04:36] <dblosevn> as snover said, scripts are always excuted syncronously on page load unless you include async=true
[14:05:28] <KWhat_Work> Are events delivered sync or async?
[14:06:35] <snover> wat
[14:06:36] <b-ot> How can make this mutually exclusive using a jquery? Please help
[14:06:46] <mib_mib> KWhat_Work: if it is just a regular script tag
[14:07:52] * KWhat_Work needs a js debugger

[14:11:40] <shoky> rideh: dpd.notes.del({
[14:11:56] <rideh> yeah supposed to pass it an object
[14:11:58] <shoky> but you didn't put an actual object there
[14:12:01] <shoky> key:value pairs
[14:12:18] <rideh> bah i see what i did
[14:12:29] <rideh> api for del function doesnt take an object while everything else seems to
[14:13:56] <FrameFever> I have an array of "li" items, and they should be inserted into the ul after a certain "li" in one go
[14:14:03] <FrameFever> is there some shortcut for this action?
[14:14:21] <rideh> shoky: thanks for spotting that
[14:14:22] <shoky> ?after
[14:14:23] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[14:14:39] <rideh> anyone have thoughts on deployd?
[14:15:04] <FrameFever> shoky: I knew this method
[14:15:19] <FrameFever> shoky: maybe you know a short cut for this action?
[14:16:05] <FrameFever> but this list, how it is, after the element
[14:16:10] <FrameFever> -but
[14:16:12] <FrameFever> +put
[14:16:18] <shoky> $(liToInsertAfter).after( arrayOfLisToInsert )  ?
[14:17:58] <FrameFever> shoky: what array expect jquery?
[14:18:06] <FrameFever> an array with jquery elements?
[14:18:08] <shoky> an array of elements
[14:18:20] <shoky> a jquery object is fine too..
[14:18:41] <shoky> read the docs, i linked you
[14:26:33] <FrameFever> shoky: using "before" seems not to work like using "after"
[14:26:49] <shoky> oh?
[14:27:23] <FrameFever> I have an array of elements first index 1, last index 5
[14:27:39] <shoky> uh
[14:27:46] <shoky> arrays start at index 0
[14:27:51] <shoky> but ok..?
[14:28:32] <FrameFever> ahh wait it is different
[14:28:44] <FrameFever> now I mean ID
[14:28:59] <FrameFever> Array{5,4,3,2,1} to better visualize it
[14:29:08] <shoky> huh?
[14:29:34] <FrameFever> now using before with this index will place before "6"
[14:29:48] <FrameFever> will result in this html struct 5,4,3,2,1,6
[14:29:58] <FrameFever> shoky: do you understand?
[14:30:05] <shoky> that's usually what 'before' means
[14:30:11] <Hereisanotherlie> I'm trying to find out how I can do a hover on an li to do a slide down/slide up on a ul below it
[14:30:50] <FrameFever> okay it will place it before in the same manner like using after
[14:31:05] <FrameFever> calling after element by element, it will work different
[14:31:21] <Hereisanotherlie> this is what I have so far but its not working if you do it a couple times http://jsfiddle.net/Lfg8J/
[14:31:44] <Hereisanotherlie> oh whoops thats the wrong one
[14:32:09] <Hereisanotherlie> http://jsfiddle.net/Lfg8J/1/ there
[14:32:31] <FrameFever> shoky: using push_front for arrays is not available for javascript?
[14:33:31] <Eviltwin> JavaScript has push, pop, shift, unshift instead of push_back, pop_back, pop_font, and push_front
[14:34:39] <YammYcoding> is that wrong? $(".us").click( function() { $(".portuguese").hide(); $(".english").show(); }
[14:34:47] <Hereisanotherlie> I feel like I just need to remove something on the mouse leave idk what it is though
[14:35:01] <YammYcoding> i set <a href class="us"> english </a>
[14:35:15] <YammYcoding> and <div class="english">
[14:35:20] <shoky> Hereisanotherlie: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Lfg8J/2/  a bit better
[14:36:29] <shoky> YammYcoding: if you close that click( with a )  then it won't be "wrong"
[14:36:37] <Eviltwin> YammYcoding: http://jsfiddle.net/aaS7Z/
[14:36:37] <Hereisanotherlie> shoky: yeah that's working a lot better thank you
[14:37:08] <YammYcoding> other than that, it's correct? cause I click and nothing happens
[14:37:26] <shoky> did you check Eviltwin's fiddle
[14:37:29] <Eviltwin> Are you using $(document).ready ?
[14:37:50] <YammYcoding> oh wait. no! rofl
[14:38:05] * YammYcoding facepalm
[14:38:25] <YammYcoding> i knew it was something stupid =)
[14:39:37] <YammYcoding> hmm damm not that yet
[14:40:17] <YammYcoding> this jsfiddle runs jquery automagicaly?
[14:40:18] <Eviltwin> YammYcoding: Try adding an alert like this one: http://jsfiddle.net/aaS7Z/1/
[14:40:38] <Eviltwin> Yes, it "runs jQuery" "automagically"
[14:40:39] <Eviltwin> Sure
[14:40:49] <YammYcoding> i put a breakpoint but it doesn't even enters it
[14:40:54] <YammYcoding> cool thing =D
[14:41:00] <shoky> it helps that jquery is selected as framework on the left..
[14:41:39] <shoky> put 'debugger;' in your code if breakpoints dont help
[14:44:33] <YammYcoding> ah it worked! thanks! it was some typos from my blurry vision :p
[14:45:27] <YammYcoding> i blame that damm all-day-migraine :p
[14:45:51] <KWhat_Work> Is there a way to tell what widget was created on what element?
[14:47:03] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: Do you know the widget or the element in question?
[14:47:36] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to find the widgets associated with an element or the elements associated with a widget?
[14:48:09] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: the former, widgets associated with elements
[14:49:11] <Eviltwin> The .data() has an object for each widget
[14:49:35] <Eviltwin> Alternatively if you know the types of widget you're interested in
[14:49:43] <Eviltwin> $("#myelem").is(":ui-resizable") etc
[14:50:07] <Eviltwin> See this for more info: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[14:50:19] <YammYcoding> if i set the .click event to an image directly, can i remove the a href around it ?
[14:50:57] <KWhat_Work> oh nice thanks Eviltwin
[14:53:35] <YammYcoding> i want a button to be an image for one language, or toggle to the image of another language.
[14:53:46] <YammYcoding> how could i do this?
[14:54:16] <YammYcoding> like. <img src="pt"> or <img src="us">
[14:54:22] <YammYcoding> if click one, toggle to the other
[15:00:21] <razzi> YammYcoding, what do you mean with toggle when speaking of an image?
[15:02:29] <YammYcoding> i have two images as flags for two languages.
[15:02:39] <YammYcoding> when click A, hide B, and viceversa
[15:03:04] <YammYcoding> but also when click A, shows div A, and hides div B
[15:04:23] <YammYcoding> this show hide makes it complicated a little
[15:06:28] <YammYcoding> http://pastebin.com/sWeud7tH
[15:06:33] <YammYcoding> this seems wrong
[15:06:44] <YammYcoding> i might be doing it the most complicated way as i always do :)
[15:07:17] <YammYcoding> the us,pt are the buttons.
[15:07:28] <YammYcoding> the bigger are the divs contents for each button
[15:08:02] <redheadphones> how can i pass a different 'this' to a jquery-ui slider 'slide' callback?
[15:09:07] <redheadphones> i've got it wrapped up in an object, and would like to have access to other functions in the object when it fires
[15:09:38] <black_warlock> items in jqui are defined as ui.item
[15:11:22] <black_warlock> who can help me serializing 3dimensional objects ?
[15:11:28] <TelFiRE> I just tried about a dozen different jQuery scroll bars. None of them work. Either they do absolutely nothing or throw js errors. I need one that works and doesn't require fancy markup! Anyone?
[15:12:23] <black_warlock> did you try the one on dynamic drive ?
[15:12:34] <black_warlock> TelFiRE ?
[15:12:38] <black_warlock> http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex11/facescroll/index.htm
[15:12:47] <black_warlock> it works perfectly
[15:12:48] <TelFiRE> let me give that one a shot
[15:12:56] <black_warlock> tested
[15:13:05] <Toup> YammYcoding I guess I would add another class to your two english elements, and one to your portuguese elements, and then do something like that http://pastebin.com/uq8EEE3D
[15:13:29] <Toup> so that you can alway add elements to be shown/hidden tied to a language without having to alter your js
[15:18:23] <TelFiRE> black_warlock: I just plugged that in
[15:18:36] <TelFiRE> While the results are more promising than every other one I've tried, they are not good :s
[15:19:08] <TelFiRE> all my content is in a tiny column now, and completely impossible to scorll
[15:19:25] <shoky> jScrollPane worked ok for me
[15:19:36] <shoky> didn't use it too much though
[15:21:23] <black_warlock> but you can personalize the css dam
[15:23:37] <TelFiRE> it seems stuff works on the left side of my page which is fairly straightforward
[15:24:08] <TelFiRE> but sadly the right side of my page has some elements that are absolute and such and I guess it's wigging all the scrollbar plugins out. You'd think if overflow:auto can work it'd be doable :s
[15:26:23] <chare> How do i do something like       holder = $("#board");  $("holder > div > span")
[15:27:08] <black_warlock> TelFiRE overflow auto works ?
[15:27:26] <TelFiRE> black_warlock: yeah
[15:27:31] <TelFiRE> works fine, as expected
[15:27:32] <dblosevn> grr why wont this work, ... $(this).closest('a').prop('title', 'Collapse sidebar'); where this is div in <a><div>
[15:27:43] <TelFiRE> throw any kind of jquery scrollbar plugin and it never works at all
[15:28:09] <TelFiRE> http://urgent.cpstest1.info/ if anyone cares to have a look. The right column is what's giving me woes. Seems to work well in left.
[15:30:41] <TelFiRE> might just be something weird in the css :S but if I just set that div it creates to left:0 right:0 it doesn't create the right side scrollbar, I can however see a horizontal scroll bar appear when I hover...
[15:31:06] <dblosevn> nevermind, i had my title backwards it was working
[15:32:56] <black_warlock> but did you check is there the related image of personalized scrollbar?
[15:33:09] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/mdd3a/2/
[15:34:03] <TelFiRE> umm not sure what you mean
[15:34:25] <black_warlock> i dunno which script are you using we cant image whats wrong
[15:34:32] <TelFiRE> http://urgent.cpstest1.info/
[15:34:40] <TelFiRE> I used the one you recomended
[15:34:44] <TelFiRE> FaceScroll
[15:36:36] <black_warlock> i dont get it
[15:36:38] <black_warlock> whats this?
[15:36:56] <TelFiRE> It's the site I'm working on....
[15:37:03] <TelFiRE> And trying to get to scroll properly
[15:37:19] <TelFiRE> the left side works fine and the right side is totally hosed by the plugin
[15:39:43] <black_warlock> i dotn get you mane if auto scroll works
[15:39:58] <black_warlock> must works also the personalized scrollbar
[15:40:10] <black_warlock> you are missing something
[15:40:39] <TelFiRE> No
[15:40:46] <TelFiRE> the plugin does not work applied to the right side
[15:40:49] <TelFiRE> that is simply not the case
[15:40:53] <TelFiRE> I have posted direct link with evidence
[15:41:04] <TelFiRE> I am calling the scrollbar the exact same way in both cases
[15:41:06] <TelFiRE> one works, one does not
[15:41:19] <TelFiRE> there's something with my style and/or markup that is bugging out the scrollbar plugin
[15:42:05] <black_warlock> im inside that page
[15:42:15] <black_warlock> and i dont see any jq ui loaded insde code
[15:42:31] <TelFiRE> I'm sorry you don't see it
[15:42:44] <TelFiRE> it's there
[15:42:55] <TelFiRE> the plugin is running
[15:42:58] <TelFiRE> there are no errors
[15:43:04] <black_warlock> ah yes i found it
[15:43:04] <TelFiRE> it works perfectly well on the left side.
[15:43:29] <TelFiRE> I know my markup is quite obscure
[15:43:43] <TelFiRE> but unfortunately a lot of it is out of my control
[15:44:20] <black_warlock> one sec
[15:45:42] <TelFiRE> thanks for looking appreciate any advice. And glad you mentioned this plugin, at least it's got me further than the last 12
[15:48:22] <black_warlock> i dont find this line
[15:48:34] <black_warlock> $('#demo1').alternateScroll();
[15:48:39] <black_warlock> or
[15:49:15] <black_warlock> $('.alt-scroll-holder').alternateScroll();
[15:49:49] <TelFiRE> black_warlock: it's in urgentrx.js line 45
[15:50:06] <TelFiRE> if you're looking at a version from a certain time frame, I may have it commented out.
[15:50:11] <black_warlock> try giving another name
[15:50:19] <black_warlock> to the second div
[15:50:20] <TelFiRE> i was testing if I could just run jQuery('#zone-preface').alternateScroll(); from console. It does the same thing
[15:50:43] <TelFiRE> I tried applying it to jQuery('#zone-preface .grid-12').alternateScroll(); instead too and same thing happens
[15:50:54] <TelFiRE> not sure why the name would affect anything. As I said I don't have a lot of control over this markup
[15:51:03] <black_warlock> hum
[15:51:33] <black_warlock> try with $('name').live()..alternateScroll()
[15:51:40] <black_warlock> try with $('name').live().alternateScroll()
[15:51:56] <TelFiRE> I cssed it a bit and I can see the scrollbar sort of flash before it disappears
[15:52:15] <TelFiRE> trying that
[15:52:30] <TelFiRE> it doesn't like the live()
[15:52:43] <Forrestr> $("#dpp_button[id^='dpp_button-'").click(function() {  What would be the correct syntax to target each id with id="dpp_button-1" / dpp_button-2 / etc..
[15:52:45] <TelFiRE> uncaught typeError: cannot call method 'replace' of undefined, giving errors from jquery itself
[15:54:09] <black_warlock> what jquery are you using with jqui ?
[15:54:18] <black_warlock> you know you have to use 1.7.2 ?
[15:54:35] <black_warlock> because the last jq 1.8 its bugged with jq-ui ?
[15:55:07] <TelFiRE> no I can't use that new of a jquery
[15:55:13] <black_warlock> jq-ui 1.18 must be used with jquery 1.7.2
[15:55:32] <black_warlock> hu ? why ?
[15:55:46] <TelFiRE> 1.5.2
[15:55:49] <TelFiRE> is the latest I can have
[15:56:14] <TelFiRE> there are other conflicts with newer jqueries within the framework I am using. But if this was a problem, the left side would not work.
[15:56:35] <black_warlock> ahhh
[15:58:05] <black_warlock> huuuu
[15:58:10] <black_warlock> i think i understood
[16:02:35] <TelFiRE> oy dammit
[16:02:45] <TelFiRE> I had it working by changing some styles around and messing around in console
[16:02:48] <TelFiRE> but I can't get it again
[16:02:50] <shoky> Forrestr: $('[id^="dpp_button-"]')  but you should really use a shared class for that
[16:07:22] <black_warlock> TelFiRE also in the normal script it makes problems
[16:07:35] <TelFiRE> ?
[16:07:36] <Forrestr> Thanks shoky
[16:07:38] <black_warlock> if there are 2 box with the same class it wont work
[16:07:52] <TelFiRE> I was just trying that
[16:07:53] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/mdd3a/8/
[16:08:04] <black_warlock> check it out i duped the box
[16:08:13] <black_warlock> and in the second doesnt work
[16:08:52] <black_warlock> instead it works if names are different
[16:08:53] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/mdd3a/9/
[16:08:58] <black_warlock> see?
[16:09:09] <TelFiRE> it doesn't work because you were calling it on #demo3 which doesn't exist in markup
[16:09:30] <black_warlock> but
[16:09:54] <black_warlock> no no
[16:10:00] <black_warlock> there are 2 demo1 !!!
[16:10:03] <TelFiRE> black_warlock: those are ids not classes. you can't have multiple identical ids, so it's not surprising that it would bug out.
[16:10:09] <TelFiRE> classes work fine
[16:10:15] <TelFiRE> anyway this is totally unrelated to my issue
[16:10:35] <TelFiRE> it's a unique id, there's not others on the page
[16:10:46] <TelFiRE> I did try applying it to .block once, of which there are many, but that didn't work anyway
[16:11:04] <shoky> TelFiRE: ttry removing position:absolute  for  .js-enabled #zone-preface .block
[16:11:46] <black_warlock> aye for classes works
[16:12:06] <TelFiRE> shoky: I need it :/ animation doesn't work without it
[16:12:33] <TelFiRE> Dammit though! It works!
[16:13:07] <shoky> TelFiRE: well it's causing the height of its container to be computed as 0, which is the problem
[16:13:12] <TelFiRE> ahhh it works anyway :D the scroll bar must end up absoluting it anyway because it isn't doing what it did before
[16:13:21] <TelFiRE> thank you so much! One last curiosity though
[16:13:26] <TelFiRE> it's giving me a horiz scrollbar
[16:13:35] <TelFiRE> any ideas why it thinks it's a little too wide?
[16:13:41] <TelFiRE> everything in there should be flexible
[16:16:08] <shoky> i dunno.. lots of small paddings everywhere
[16:43:35] <MrPunkin> Just to be sure I understand correctly… delay only works on jQuery animations, and there is no way to chain in a delay of something such as an element empty
[16:50:28] <pentarex> hey guys I have a problem http://pastie.org/private/e3oijjw8obtwia7ji4zyg I cannot append this div because the second ajax success is little bit slower ... this is the problem $('#info'+i).append('<div id="subtitles'+j+'">' + subs.items.item[j].filename +'</div>');
[16:52:33] <shoky> MrPunkin: you can .queue(..) anything you want
[16:54:10] <MrPunkin> shoky: how would that delay the running of .empty() for 250 milliseconds?
[16:54:22] <shoky> pentarex: by the time the success callback is called, the outer loop is already long finished. so 'i' would not be what you want it to be
[16:54:33] <MrPunkin> shoky: no animations or effects, just delaying stuff from running for a time period
[16:54:41] <pentarex> ok I will try something different
[16:54:46] <shoky> MrPunkin:  either setTimeout or .queue(..)
[16:55:08] <MrPunkin> shoky: setTimeout is fine, but it's not chainable. Guess there isn't a way to do what I want
[16:56:24] <shoky> .delay(250).queue(function(next) { $(this).empty(); next(); })
[16:57:01] <MrPunkin> shoky: delay only works on fx
[16:57:05] <MrPunkin> according to the docs
[16:57:14] <MrPunkin> right?
[16:57:26] <shoky> no
[16:57:29] <MrPunkin> or does your queue method bypass that by placing the stuff in the callback?
[16:57:37] <shoky> it only works on the queue names 'fx' which is the default queue
[16:57:41] <shoky> named*
[16:57:58] <shoky> if you don't pass a queue name to .queue(..)  then it defaults to 'fx'
[16:58:14] <MrPunkin> shoky: Okay thanks. I'll give it a try
[16:59:31] <shoky> i meant of course, .delay works on any queue, 'fx' being the default
[16:59:54] <MrPunkin> gothca
[16:59:59] <MrPunkin> *gotcha
[17:01:25] <shoky> pentarex: use $.each it'll make your life easier
[17:02:04] <blink> Hey shoky
[17:02:11] <shoky> hy blink
[17:02:39] <blink> that function for the counter worked perfect :)
[17:02:59] <shoky> heh. glad to hear
[17:04:09] <blink> Yes could you look at this for me http://jsfiddle.net/nSMw4/18/ i want to strip all the html tags right when people paste something, it work now when you start to type < > but not on paste
[17:04:38] <blink> i dont know what im doing wrong thought the html() function was for removing html tags
[17:04:47] <shoky> you have a syntax error
[17:05:23] <blink> let me look
[17:06:49] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nSMw4/19/
[17:07:47] <shoky> i hope that's not the only way you plan to keep the data 'secure' ;]
[17:08:19] <blink> let me look at it and yeah of course not the server side security for that is already done :)
[17:08:41] <shoky> then why bother with this :\
[17:08:56] <blink> thats why when i refresh the page after submiting ajax the strip tags trim and real escape function takes care of eveyrything
[17:09:06] <shoky> i mean, maybe show the user a warning or smth, but this is just annoying
[17:10:17] <blink> yeah but there is really no need to use < > for anything and it just creates a lot of problems so i would rather not let people use it
[17:10:36] <blink> let me test this
[17:13:51] <blink> shoky yeah it work on the main textarea :) this is amazing,you dont know how much i thank you
[17:14:59] <blink> when i finish the site maybe i could write some little section with thanks to your help, its those little things that really matters
[17:15:26] <shoky> heh that's ok, thx ;p
[17:17:45] <blink> been working 4 months right now on this project should be done soon :)
[17:39:30] <bodhibyte> hello : )
[17:40:27] <airshock> Hi all. I'm new to jQuery and am running into a bit of a problem. Trying to use the jQuery UI dialog widget to show a dialog both when slink is clicked on a form and when that form is submitted, but neither are working. Details to follow.
[17:41:05] <airshock> Every time I click the link I get the error, "Type error, <page URL> is not a function" while its evaluating the function that controls what happens when that link is clicked.
[17:41:24] <airshock> Here is the jQuery/JS code, the file is named dialogs.js: var exit = function() {
[17:41:24] <airshock> $(this).closest('.ui-dialog-content').dialog('close');
[17:41:24] <airshock> }
[17:41:24] <airshock> var dlgoptions = {
[17:41:24] <airshock>         buttons: {
[17:41:24] <airshock>             "OK": exit
[17:41:24] <airshock>         }
[17:41:25] <airshock> };
[17:41:26] <airshock>                 $(function () {
[17:41:27] <airshock> function signin(){
[17:41:27] <airshock>         $('#sicongratsdlg').dialog(dlgoptions);
[17:41:28] <airshock>         return false;
[17:41:28] <airshock>     };
[17:41:29] <airshock> function whatsthis(){
[17:41:30] <airshock>         $('#whatsthisdlg').dialog(dlgoptions);
[17:41:30] <airshock>         return false;
[17:41:31] <airshock> };
[17:41:31] <airshock> });
[17:41:48] <tw2113> jsfiddleplz
[17:42:08] <airshock> And here is the code for the HTML/HP page that contains the form and includes the dialogs.js file.
[17:42:10] <airshock> http://pastesite.com/83375
[17:42:33] <airshock> Anyway, any assistance on what I'm doing wrong is greatly appreciated, as I can't for the life of me figure out what's going on or how I can fix things.
[17:43:20] <coldhead> can you link to a live demo, airshock ?
[17:45:32] <airshock> coldhead: http://audioshout.com/index2.php (temporary live demo, the "What's this" link is what is supposed to open the dialog, and so is form submission)
[17:47:12] <coldhead> why are you using onclick= ?
[17:47:33] <bodhibyte> I'm trying to click a row in order to alert the value of the row's column with class getMyValue, http://jsfiddle.net/JPQPR/6/
[17:47:36] <airshock> Shoot, for some reason my first paste didn't work, this is the code for dialogs.js: http://pastesite.com/83374
[17:49:16] <bodhibyte> anybody know how to get this to work?
[17:49:24] <airshock> coldhead: Pretty much because I don't know of a better way to do that.
[17:49:37] <coldhead> $('#whatsthis').click(whatsthis);
[17:51:04] <airshock> coldhead: And then I just remove onclick= from the HTML but keep everything else the same?
[17:55:25] <airshock> Removing the onclick= and using the .click method or whatever that's called solved the link problem, but the form still doesn't show a dialog when submitted like it's supposed to for some reason.
[17:58:24] <coldhead> did you update the demo airshock ?
[17:58:29] <coldhead> i can take a look once you have
[17:58:51] <airshock> Yep, go ahead and refresh.
[17:59:13] <coldhead> are you using onsubmit?
[17:59:24] <coldhead> yes you are
[17:59:26] <coldhead> same deal
[17:59:30] <airshock> coldhead: Oh also note when trying to submit the form, the first name, last name, and username fields have to be filled out otherwise it will generate an error. The dialog is only supposed to show on a successful submission, otherwise errors are generated.
[17:59:40] <coldhead> give the form an ID
[17:59:59] <coldhead> then $('#form_id').submit(function () {signin(); return false;});
[18:02:27] <pentarex> shoky: I´ve tried var index; index=i; into the for loop and assing in the success $(¨#info¨+index).append(....) but again nothing was appended to info
[18:04:30] <airshock> coldhead: Just updated the demo with that (replaced form_id with my actual ID) but that didn't work, unfortunately. Safri doesn't give any syntax errors or etc. though.
[18:05:33] <coldhead> airshock: <form name="signin" method="post" action="/index2.php" onsubmit="signin();">
[18:05:37] <coldhead> that's what i see on the demo
[18:05:45] <coldhead> no ID and you still have onsubmit
[18:05:50] <coldhead> like it's the 1980s
[18:08:56] <airshock> coldhead: Forgot that I still had onsubmit=, and didn't realize the form tag was missing an ID. Anyway, just corrected those two things and now things work without any issues. I wish there was a way to get the error messages for invalid entries to all be dialogs too but since that's part of the PHP code of the page I don't think it's possible.
[18:09:41] <coldhead> airshock: consider using html5 validation attributes
[18:09:52] <coldhead> i.e. <input type="text" required="required">
[18:09:58] <coldhead> or <input type="email">
[18:10:08] <coldhead> you get some decent free validation and errors that way
[18:10:12] <snover> coldhead: nice mix of html and xhtml
[18:10:49] <coldhead> it's a lingua franca, snovesy
[18:11:00] <coldhead> ANYWAY THE BROWSER ACCEPTS IT SO SHUT UP, THAT'S WHY
[18:15:01] <airshock> coldhead: Ah, OK, though I may have to change the PHP code a the top of the page that handles errors if I used the HTML 5 tags, will have to research that. Notice now I use echo statements to produce the JS standard message boxes.
[18:15:42] <coldhead> yes, it's ingenius of you
[18:19:25] <airshock> coldhead: If I had known about jQuery UI back when I wrote all the erro handling code I could have used that, and I'm sure there's some great way to incorporate it now I just don't know how to do it.
[18:19:45] <coldhead> well now you know to look into it for next time
[18:21:54] <airshock> coldhead: Yep. My only other question now is, after you close the dialog upon successful submission of the form, the form values still remain. Is there a way using jQuery to have the form cleared?
[18:22:07] <coldhead> ?mdc reset
[18:22:09] <bot-t> coldhead, counter-reset - CSS | MDN - The counter-reset CSS property is used to reset CSS Counters to a given value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/counter-reset
[18:22:18] <coldhead> that is not helpful, bot-t
[18:22:19] <bot-t> coldhead, Stored "that".
[18:22:33] <coldhead> goddamn you
[18:22:42] <coldhead> ?mdc form.reset @ airshock
[18:22:46] <bot-t> airshock, form.reset - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - reset resets the form to its initial state. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/form.reset
[18:23:01] <coldhead> it's not jquery, airshock, it's pure classic vanilla JS
[18:25:56] <airshock> coldhead: Thanks, didn't know about that.
[18:30:51] <airshock> coldhead: Any particular reason why when the form is submitted with noe errors, the congratulations dialog appears for a second then disappears as the page reloads itself?
[18:31:47] <coldhead> probably because the page is reloading
[18:32:01] <coldhead> you might want to use AJAX to submit the data without a refresh
[18:33:15] <airshock> coldhead: Can you point me in the right direction on how to do that? Pretty much clueless when it comes to AJAX.
[18:36:34] <coldhead> airshock: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
[18:36:51] <coldhead> read the earlier stuff too if need be, all very educational

[18:43:36] <pentarex> sry...
[18:44:54] <airshock> coldhead: Thanks.
[18:46:59] <vedder_> hey guys im wondering how to avoid having the alert message when im redirected succesfully.. i can manage the messages to validate but when it is ok i need to get rid of the message http://pastie.org/5338142
[19:03:58] <YammYcoding> i added a div with more content that it fits in a prettyphoto popup. The vertical scrolls didn't work, anyone knows if it's a bug?
[19:04:28] <YammYcoding> or maybe a missing setup?
[19:34:10] <airshock> WOuld someone mind taking a look at the following code and telling me what exactly my syntax error is and how I can fix it? Browser says it's on line 55, but everything looks fine to me. Then again though I am visually impaired and sometimes my screen reader screws up reading symbols. http://pastesite.com/83389
[19:38:34] <CountryGeek> airshock: maybe line 55 should be removed?
[19:40:41] <coldhead> ?beauty @ airshock
[19:40:41] <bot-t> airshock, please beautify your horrible code at http://jsbeautifier.org <3
[19:41:33] <CountryGeek> airshock: Probably the last line as well
[19:45:14] <airshock> Removing lines 55 and the last one helped and solved the problem. Thanks. :)

[21:10:47] <coldhead> good chat CountryGeek
[21:11:30] <CountryGeek> coldhead: it's late, wasn't paying as much attention as I should've
[21:12:02] <coldhead> it was a welcome distraction, don't worry!
[21:12:17] <coldhead> makes me wish i were using activerecord

[21:15:19] <CountryGeek> I was doing the same thing 4 mos ago, but we decided to bite the bullet and move it all over.   Still tryin' to heave this monster over the fence
[21:15:45] <CountryGeek> I won't miss those SQL queries "carved out of wood"
[21:16:15] <CountryGeek> I may miss the performance, though =-O
[21:18:23] <coldhead> performance is overrated
[21:18:34] <coldhead> you can just cache and throw SSDs at the problem
[21:29:31] <katsh> if i do $('#sex').something, is there a way to find out which html element that class is in?
[21:29:49] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: ssds almost make perf optimizations pontless... almost
[21:32:06] <coldhead> can you rephrase that question, katsh ?
[21:32:14] <coldhead> i am too stupid to understand
[21:37:24] <katsh> say i have <div id="abc">..</div>
[21:37:54] <katsh> then in jquery i do $('#abc').something to find out what element #abc is an attrinute of
[21:38:03] <katsh> ya feels me dawg?
[21:38:07] <dwarder_> if i set div to display:none will it still be accesseble for .text ?
[21:38:07] <dwarder_> ?
[21:38:14] <katsh> no
[21:38:20] <coldhead> katsh: do you mean what it's parent is?
[21:38:28] <katsh> coldhead: no. what IT is
[21:38:32] <coldhead> ohh
[21:38:41] <katsh> what html tag it is in
[21:38:41] <coldhead> $('#abc')[0].tagName
[21:38:45] <coldhead> (i think)
[21:38:46] <katsh> ty sir
[21:40:03] <dwarder_> katsh: no, for me?
[21:40:21] <dwarder_> if i set div to display:none will it still be accesseble for .text ?
[21:40:30] <katsh> yes no for you
[21:40:48] <dwarder_> thank you for you :)
[21:40:54] <katsh> it you don't see it when view the page's source, it won't get .text
[22:39:50] <someprimetime> coldhead: are you asleep sweet prince
[22:41:06] <coldhead> no i am not
[22:41:56] <someprimetime> oh you
[22:42:04] <someprimetime> did i wake you from your beauty slumber?
[22:42:31] <coldhead> only in a spiritual sense
[22:44:28] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RrmNm/15/ how would you go about having the buttons increment/decrement +/- 2 depending on if you've already voted either up or down? without having it go < 0 though
[22:44:58] <someprimetime> e.g. reddit voting
[22:46:11] <Cork> someprimetime: reddit only allow you one vote right?
[22:46:34] <Mage> your votes dont count
[22:46:37] <someprimetime> Cork: yeah... there are a bunch of different cases though when you deal with the score having more downvotes than upvotes
[22:46:49] <someprimetime> i've aleady done it, but it's sloppy as hell with too many if statements
[22:47:02] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/bHfFj/
[22:47:04] <someprimetime> original ^
[22:47:07] <Cork> someprimetime: so you would have to store each users vote separately
[22:47:10] <someprimetime> i kept finding more cases
[22:47:12] <coldhead> someprimetime: i'd do whatever Cork says
[22:47:34] <someprimetime> Cork: the actual voting works (on the server) i've already written that
[22:47:35] <Cork> else you have no way of telling if the use has voted, and let them change it
[22:47:41] <someprimetime> but it's just to give the user quick visual feedback
[22:48:24] <Cork> are you sending there current state to the page when the page loads?
[22:48:31] <someprimetime> yep
[22:48:33] <Cork> ok
[22:49:19] <someprimetime> i put in the upvote/downvote class on page load (if they've voted or downvoted) and show the count
[22:49:23] <someprimetime> with # of upvotes and downvotes
[22:49:42] <Cork> so what is it you need help with?
[22:50:00] <randomdev> Can someone help me resolve a jquery conflict?
[22:50:11] <Cork> converting the button to a direction?
[22:50:24] <Cork> ?ask @ randomdev
[22:50:25] <bot-t> randomdev, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:50:31] <someprimetime> i need help figuring out the best way to decrease the user's vote if they a) already voted up b) are voting down.. so say the score is initially 1.. they vote.. it brings it to 2... then they click down vote and now it should bring it to 0
[22:50:43] <randomdev> ok.. what is the best way to resolve a jquery conflict?
[22:50:52] <someprimetime> but say the initial score is 0.. they vote up.. new score == 1... then they vote down.. new score needs to be 0 (can't go below 0)
[22:51:07] <Cork> randomdev: you mean a conflict with another framework?
[22:51:10] <someprimetime> Cork: the button currently is a direction `up` or `down`
[22:51:22] <randomdev> I think its 2 jquery modules conflicting
[22:51:35] <randomdev> joomla modules sorry
[22:51:40] <randomdev> using jquery
[22:51:43] <someprimetime> joomla.. ouch
[22:51:53] <someprimetime>  i mean yay joomla
[22:51:57] <randomdev> yeah gets hard to see whats loading what :/
[22:52:10] <Cork> randomdev: if its joomla conflicting then you would have to ask them
[22:52:13] <beachandbytes> someprimetime
[22:52:31] <Cork> jquery is normally built in a way that they don't conflict
[22:52:36] <randomdev> its not joomla as such, but 2 modules using jquery (an rss reader and an image lightbox slider thingy)
[22:52:40] <someprimetime> yo
[22:53:00] <Cork> randomdev: you mean like they require there own version of jquery or what?
[22:53:06] <randomdev> yeah
[22:53:07] <someprimetime> randomdev: in paul irish's 10 things i learned from the jquery source he discusses the noconflict code if you're interested ;D
[22:53:13] <someprimetime> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_qE1iAmjFg
[22:53:14] <randomdev> tho i tried disabled one of the jquery loads and then it didnt work
[22:53:26] <Cork> someprimetime: so you just want to prevent it from going below 0 or "initialvalue" ?
[22:53:34] <paul_irish> it's a good watch

[22:59:08] <paul_irish> he is, yeah
[22:59:27] <someprimetime> man i just started using sass like last week and it's game changing
[22:59:29] <randomdev> http://jsfiddle.net/sLgDM/1/ like that ?
[22:59:40] <Cork> randomdev: but that seams to be a joomla specific file so i'm mostly just guessing
[22:59:44] <bnb_dev> In plugin authoring http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[23:00:05] <Cork> (cause its not a jquery plugin)
[23:00:26] <Cork> randomdev: yes, give that a shot
[23:00:47] <randomdev> i was going to try something like $.noConflict(); before the $
[23:00:57] <randomdev> will try your suggestion now
[23:01:16] <bnb_dev> why we use this.each to return  this ?
[23:01:21] <paul_irish> how goes Cork
[23:01:47] <Cork> paul_irish: fiddeling with a hary ruby route :/
[23:02:12] <Cork> bnb_dev: its not to return
[23:02:18] <paul_irish> o
[23:02:23] <randomdev> ergh ticker is references someplace and is causing a new error var MyRSSReaderTicker138 = new Ticker("MyRSSReaderTicker138",{ etc etc
[23:02:31] <paul_irish> so fiddly
[23:02:33] <Cork> bnb_dev: its just a combination of this.each(); return this;
[23:02:49] <randomdev> but i did find $('MyRSSReaderTicker138').addEvent('mouseleave', function() {MyRSSReaderTicker138.resume();}); so maybe i will try wrapping that
[23:03:02] <Cork> randomdev: thats not jquery
[23:03:09] <bnb_dev> Cork: in Maintaining Chainability, I did not understand return this.each(function() { ...
[23:03:15] <Cork> that's another framework or some from of small helper
[23:03:49] <Cork> bnb_dev: return this.each(function() {}); is a shorthand for this.each(function() {}); return this;
[23:04:14] <Cork> bnb_dev: each and return doesn't really have anything to do with each other
[23:04:46] <Cork> the return is just to make sure you can chain jquery calls after your plugin
[23:05:04] <Cork> and each is so the plugin works on each element in the selector (not just the first one)
[23:05:38] <bnb_dev> Cork: ok I got
[23:06:26] <bnb_dev> one thing more that is confusing me
[23:06:28] <garbagecollectio> anyone there
[23:06:31] <garbagecollectio> for javascript help
[23:06:42] <Cork> ?ask @ garbagecollectio
[23:06:43] <bot-t> garbagecollectio, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:08:22] <bnb_dev> Cork: can you explain $.fn.lockDimensions
[23:08:38] <Cork> bnb_dev: what about it?
[23:09:09] <bnb_dev> I mean lockDimensions  is the property of prototype ?
[23:09:26] <Cork> its a member of prototype yes
[23:10:07] <bnb_dev> and prototype  is the constructor or constructor's property ?
[23:10:30] <someprimetime> that just adds it to the jQuery prototype
[23:10:46] <Cork> bnb_dev: i think you over think it a bit
[23:10:47] <someprimetime> so you can $('.attach-it').toYourDOM();
[23:10:50] <someprimetime> or something else
[23:11:00] <Cork> $.fn is what you get when you use a selector
[23:11:14] <karstenk1977_> what is wrong? jQuery("a[rel]").each(function(n){       jQuery(this).attr('rel','#'+'link_'+n);       id = 'link_'+n;       element = jQuery(this);       jQuery(this).bind('click', function(e) {         url = $(this).attr("href");         getContent(element, url, id);         return false;       });     })
[23:11:25] <Cork> $.pluginname is what you use when you use thing directly on jquery like $.each or $.get
[23:11:33] <someprimetime> karstenk1977_: for starters, your syntax
[23:11:36] <someprimetime> damn yo
[23:11:40] <someprimetime> jsfiddle?
[23:11:46] <Cork> secondly that you dump code in the channel
[23:11:51] <Cork> ?p @ karstenk1977_
[23:11:53] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:13:52] <bnb_dev> Cork: thanks
[23:15:09] <randomdev> hmm this might be a mootools problem
[23:15:32] <randomdev> i will try there thanks for the help
[23:18:09] <karstenk1977_> please have a look
[23:18:10] <karstenk1977_> http://jsfiddle.net/bFWdX/1/
[23:18:55] <karstenk1977_> lucky the example in jsfiddle is working, but the problem is in live site "id" isn´t the correct one
[23:19:46] <Cork> karstenk1977_: you'r not declaring your variables
[23:20:04] <Cork> you should ALWAYS use var before you use your variables
[23:20:04] <karstenk1977_> I think the each function to not know the correct relative value of id
[23:20:20] <Cork> you id is in the global scope
[23:20:23] <Cork> same with url
[23:20:47] <Cork> so you have one of each for all the bind click events
[23:26:56] <karstenk1977_> Why does it work in jsFiddle ( http://jsfiddle.net/bFWdX/3/ ) but not in my site ( http://steuerkanzlei.tom-develop.com/#!/405 ) ????
[23:28:04] <Cork> karstenk1977_: define "not working"
[23:28:44] <someprimetime> breakpoint episode was pretty good
[23:28:44] <karstenk1977_> html won´t be appended to the right div
[23:28:45] <someprimetime> not bad
[23:28:58] <Cork> karstenk1977_: when doing what?
[23:29:07] <someprimetime> learned some new things nice job to yarek for being so on it with the questions
[23:29:10] <karstenk1977_> click a related link
[23:29:22] <Cork> you mean in "Wieso wir" ?
[23:29:48] <karstenk1977_> yes this are the test links
[23:31:22] <Cork> wheres the code you posted in jsfiddle?
[23:31:25] <Cork> (on your page)
[23:31:33] <karstenk1977_> if you like you I can show you with teamviewer
[23:31:49] <karstenk1977_> in scripts.js header
[23:32:19] <someprimetime> teamviewer?
[23:32:21] <someprimetime> dafuq
[23:32:27] <someprimetime> this is not liveperson
[23:32:48] <karstenk1977_> who is not a liveperson?
[23:32:55] <someprimetime> everyone here
[23:33:03] <someprimetime> we're bots
[23:33:06] <karstenk1977_> haha
[23:33:16] <someprimetime> nah but just post a fiddle
[23:34:01] <Cork> karstenk1977_: you have an error in on of your selectors
[23:34:07] <DataLess> DataLess bot activated
[23:34:22] <DataLess> Hi Dave
[23:34:22] <Cork> simplest way to find where is to load an unminified version of jquery
[23:34:24] <karstenk1977_> i know, but not wher
[23:34:25] <karstenk1977_> e
[23:34:47] <Cork> debugging with a minimized version of jquery is close to hopeless
[23:34:56] <siovene> Hi. Is there a way to "watch" whether a particular element is going to get is font-size property changed?
[23:35:20] <karstenk1977_> one moment i change it
[23:35:22] <siovene> I'l like to prevent certain elements to get their font-size too small, but I would rather not poll.
[23:35:22] <someprimetime> Cork: i know a way ;)
[23:35:25] <someprimetime> prettyprint son
[23:35:44] <Cork> someprimetime: sure, but that doens't help full true
[23:35:47] <Cork> *through
[23:35:52] <someprimetime> haha i keed i keed but i do love it
[23:36:01] <someprimetime> it's excellent for learning what other people are doing imo
[23:36:03] <Cork> someprimetime: you still just have a heap of pointless names and no comments
[23:36:25] <someprimetime> which is the case in most prod environments after being ran through some sort of minifier
[23:36:32] <someprimetime> fair point.
[23:36:52] <Cork> someprimetime: ya, but you normally don't run your development env though it
[23:36:54] <Cork> for just that reason
[23:37:20] <someprimetime> just watched that breakpoint episode and was amazed that you can now edit sass within chrome
[23:37:24] <someprimetime> chrome is google's only good product imo
[23:37:53] <karstenk1977_> ok Cork I´ve changed it
[23:38:12] <Forrestr> How would I set a global variable on a click function to determine which <i id="dpp_status- it belongs to? http://pastebin.com/L6qdRZZZ
[23:38:46] <someprimetime> Forrestr: you could use the $(this) context
[23:38:54] <someprimetime> in your event handler callback
[23:40:35] <karstenk1977_> now I get the error TypeError: obj is undefined [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten]        length = obj.length,
[23:42:11] <karstenk1977_> something wrong with my .each()  ???
[23:43:08] <someprimetime> it means you never defined an object
[23:43:11] <someprimetime> it doesn't exist
[23:43:22] <karstenk1977_> ?
[23:43:23] <someprimetime> and you are trying to run an operation on it
[23:44:24] <karstenk1977_> don´t understand, cause my selector works fine
[23:44:43] <Cork> karstenk1977_: jQuery(overlayDiv).next(".contentWrap") won't work
[23:44:47] <Cork> you want .find not .next
[23:44:59] <Cork> contenWrap is a child of that element not a sibling
[23:57:48] <EnginA> there was no cross platform DOM manipulation events, right ?
[23:57:56] <EnginA> i.e. attribute added, changed, removed
