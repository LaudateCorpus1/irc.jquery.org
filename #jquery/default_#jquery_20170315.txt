[01:49:00] <sonu_nk> hi i am facing some conflict issues.. like TypeError: $.getScript is not a function from my file   render_form.js ..... and TypeError: $.ajax is not a function  from other liab..  my code is here.. http://pastebin.com/P0QzzfgL
[01:58:22] <sonu_nk> why the lot of issues coming with latest jquery 3 like conflicts
[02:11:55] <Omega> sonu_nk, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40991919/jquery-3-slim-ajax-basic-example#40992041
[02:13:33] <sonu_nk> uhhhhh...
[02:15:07] <Omega> You probably want min version and not slim version
[02:18:03] <sonu> Omega, thank you././ i am looking for a strong block which will never create conflict issue.. wht can you give me from your experience ? jQuery(function($){  .....    });   or other are strong solution there..
[03:19:02] <tokam> Hello, I like to implement smoth scrolling but the location of my object changes during scrolling
[03:46:06] <sonu> tokam, like parallex animation
[03:46:18] <tokam> what is it?
[03:46:25] <tokam> I animated again after the animation
[03:46:38] <tokam> and used the 1st animation as approximization
[03:46:39] <sonu> https://www.google.co.in/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=parlaex+site+&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=RfHIWNWDM-bn8Aek25j4AQ#channel=fs&q=parallax+site+tutorial&*
[03:47:02] <sonu> i believe you like this..
[03:53:02] <sonu>  $('#_form-render-wrap-form :input'); is it will also consider the <button > if not then why its coming in  $('#_form-render-wrap-form :input');
[03:53:02] <tokam> its cool
[03:53:03] <sonu> ?
[04:31:31] <IhrFussel> If I have a PHP script that echoes a div with an id, will Jquery automatically add it to the DOM when loaded? Or in other words: Can I directly manipulate it with Jquery or do I need to add the div yet to another div via append() first?
[04:32:19] <Cork> IhrFussel: if a php scripts adds anything to a page it happens before it is sent from the server
[04:32:41] <Cork> IhrFussel: so to jquery it will be as if it was there statically
[04:33:07] <IhrFussel> No I'm loading the div with ids via ajax...the divs are records from a db
[04:33:13] <Cork> IhrFussel: if your php script do this as a response to an ajax call, then yes you have to add the response to the page first
[04:33:51] <Cork> though you can parse the response and do "things" with it before you add it to the page
[04:34:26] <Cork> var dom = $($.parseHTML(data)); dom.find('#the-id').autocomplete()
[04:34:41] <Cork> $('#target').append(dom)
[04:34:51] <IhrFussel> Cork, but can I just do append(<div>"+responsewithid+"</div>"); ?
[04:35:02] <Cork> sure
[04:35:03] <IhrFussel> Oh I see
[04:35:04] <sonu> IhrFussel, i have a exmple for you... https://nareshkumar632.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=7
[04:35:05] <Cork> its just a string
[04:35:18] <Cork> but you can't add events to the string before you append it if you do it like that
[04:35:18] <sonu> view this much closer i think what you are doing..
[04:38:01] <IhrFussel> sonu, That is a lot of code and looks very complicated
[04:38:46] <sonu> ys.. they are doping same you like.. all the script html coming from php file
[04:38:59] <sonu> Cork, is here. he is good enough.. :)
[04:39:15] <sonu> he will give you much closer solution..
[04:39:29] <IhrFussel> Cork, so can responsewithid also contain multiple divs with unique ids and after appending I can select them via $("#idfromphp")?
[04:39:40] <Cork> IhrFussel: it is just a string
[04:39:53] <Cork> as long as it is a valid set of html partials it works just fine
[04:40:22] <Cork> (meaning all start and end tags are present and nested in the correct way)
[04:40:47] <IhrFussel> Yes but I mean will the browser identify all the IDs as real elements when appending?
[04:41:18] <Cork> IhrFussel: you seam to think something special happens cause it is loaded as an ajax call
[04:41:20] <Cork> it doesn't
[04:41:32] <Cork> it becomes part of the dom just like it would if it was there from the start
[04:41:39] <Cork> so all normal rules apply
[04:41:49] <IhrFussel> I want to load a div with a timestamp from PHP and then manipulate that particular timestamp in JS
[04:42:00] <Cork> ->> so all normal rules apply <<-
[04:42:59] <IhrFussel> Ok thanks and it's also a reliable way to just append the responses?
[04:44:13] <Cork> IhrFussel: i would prob have included the <div> in the response from the server
[04:44:20] <Cork> so you just have to do .append(response)
[04:44:27] <Cork> but other then that, sure
[04:48:21] <IhrFussel> Cork, so I can do echo "<div><span id='user_$somenumber'>$dbdata</span><span id='time_$timestamp'>$timestamp</span></div>" and when I append it all spans can be identified...great
[05:09:32] <woodrag> how do i replace . by , ? variable.replace(".",","); does not work ... ;-(
[05:10:24] <Cork> woodrag: it will return the new string
[05:10:28] <Cork> it doesn't modify it in place
[05:11:48] <woodrag> Cork: when i use: var new=old.replace(".",","); it does not work either.... ;-(
[05:13:14] <Cork> woodrag: https://jsfiddle.net/x12j0f7k/
[05:13:27] <Cork> note though it will only replace the first instance of .
[05:13:49] <Cork> to replace all of them https://jsfiddle.net/x12j0f7k/1/
[05:14:18] <woodrag> Cork: Thanx! I will test....!
[05:21:10] <woodrag> Cork: the problem is different..... When i insert a . into a number input field the value i try to fetch with $('#name').val() is empty. When i het rid of the . it works.....
[05:21:51] <Cork> woodrag: number formats the field automatically, you can't control it
[05:22:11] <Cork> the value should always be with . in it
[05:22:42] <Cork> (the formating is done using the systems locale)
[05:23:04] <woodrag> but in dutch that is a , instead of a .
[05:23:22] <Cork> then use a dutch locale for the browser
[05:29:41] <woodrag> Cork: But how do i fetch the value of a number field to do a check if it is valid?
[05:29:53] <Cork> woodrag: .val()
[05:30:01] <Cork> just like you did
[05:30:14] <Cork> if it isn't valid for the field it returns an empty string if i remember correctly
[05:30:23] <woodrag> when a . is entered val() returns an empty string.... ;-(
[05:30:59] <Cork> i think you need to change min so it allows decimals
[05:32:19] <woodrag> in the number field notation?
[05:33:54] <Cork> woodrag: https://jsfiddle.net/h7xory8o/
[05:34:53] <Cork> and finally https://jsfiddle.net/h7xory8o/1/
[05:35:46] <woodrag> but now enter 6.55 into the field....
[05:35:58] <Cork> ya?
[05:36:30] <Anticom> woodrag: value **hint**
[05:36:57] <Cork> woodrag: if you need to enter 6,55 or 6.55 depends on your systems locale
[05:37:12] <Cork> hit the arrow in the input field and see what it uses
[05:37:38] <Anticom> btw since when is the event called "change *input*" ?
[05:37:47] <Cork> Anticom: it is two events
[05:38:03] <Anticom> Cork: oh ._.
[05:38:07] <Cork> Anticom: it is the change even and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[05:38:23] <Anticom> captain derpner striked again :)
[05:38:28] <Cork> but ya, many have missed it and uses the keyup event instead
[05:38:51] <Anticom> What's the advantage of input over keyUp?
[05:39:05] <Cork> it triggers when the value is merged into the string
[05:39:21] <Cork> so you don't end up in a "before it happens" state as keydown does
[05:39:30] <Cork> but you can still prevent the change like you can in keydown
[05:39:41] <Anticom> oooh, that's clever
[05:39:50] <Cork> it only fires for event that will actually modify the field (so no problem with esc and what not)
[05:39:53] <Anticom> thanks for the elaboration
[05:40:00] <Cork> and it will fire for paste and cut events
[05:40:19] <Cork> so basically it fires as soon as the input field is changed
[05:40:30] <Cork> a warning though, it doens't fire at all for <select> elements
[05:40:36] <Anticom> and the change event is needed for the input controls?
[05:40:48] <Cork> na, not really
[05:40:55] <Anticom> but?
[05:40:56] <Cork> i just started with it and just appended the input
[05:41:10] <Anticom> okay so input is sufficient
[05:41:10] <Cork> didn't want to bother with if there was a need for it for the testcase
[05:41:19] <Anticom> that confused me for a second
[05:41:36] <Cork> well it is needed if you want to catch both input events and change events
[05:41:46] <Cork> cause that is exactly what that does
[05:42:13] <woodrag> Thanx!
[07:07:49] <Kadigan_KSB> Hey... How would I go about detecting what's the problem if my lightBox is requesting "null"? >_>
[07:09:40] <Kadigan_KSB> Wait... I think I found it.
[07:13:50] <Kadigan_KSB> Yes. In my hastiness I was attaching it to the wrong element (forgot to add " a" to my selector, was attaching to the div itself).
[07:24:04] <Kadigan_KSB> Cork: just out of curiosity, this on-change event will also fire if I modify the contents via code?
[07:24:17] <Kadigan_KSB> (referencing the discussion from 10:40)
[07:24:24] <Kadigan_KSB> (Local time; 2:30h ago)
[07:30:24] <rominronin> hey
[07:31:30] <rominronin> I'm building a one-pager out of fullpage.js. I've downloaded the examples and noticed the html is out of date. where does one begin when building html from scratch these day? ()
[07:32:07] <rominronin> (I'm so used to building with CMSs, I've lost touch with notepad-to-host site building)
[07:34:35] <Cork> Kadigan_KSB: no
[07:34:52] <Cork> Kadigan_KSB: events are fired based on user actions, never code
[07:45:59] <Anticom> rominronin: usually you begin with an empty file :>
[07:46:17] <Anticom> i don't really get what you're asking for. Also are you sure #jquery is the right channel?
[07:47:24] <rominronin> Anticom: #web and #html are currently asleep/idle
[07:47:49] <rominronin> I was looking at the html5 boilerplate project, that's the kind of thing I'm looking for.
[07:48:11] <rominronin> there are just some outdated things going on in the fullpage.js examples.
[07:49:06] <Anticom> rominronin: fork the repo and update them :> I think just no one cares sadly
[07:49:24] <rominronin> anticom you may be right
[07:50:21] <rominronin> but I'm kinda not certain what current best practices might be, considering how long its been since I've written a page without copy-pasting another html <head>
[07:50:48] <rominronin> for now, I'll just copy what the bootstrap project are using
[07:51:07] <Kadigan_KSB> Cork: okay, so that's in-line with what I observed and gotten used to. Thanks.
[07:53:00] <Kadigan_KSB> rominronin: if you're out-of-touch with what the best practices/standards currently are, I'm not sure you can find a quick'n'dirty guide for that, sorry. If it's been a long while (like "since HTML 4.01" long, like me), then you'll just need to re-learn.
[07:53:38] <Cork> rominronin: are you asking for what the needed tags for a valid minimal html file is?
[07:53:39] <rominronin> shortly after <!doctype html>, so quite a while
[07:53:42] <Kadigan_KSB> Things've gotten simpler, that's for sure. Quite in-line with how JS is getting more and more complex these days... not to mention heavy.
[07:54:13] <Cork> rominronin: if yes, then this is what you want https://paste.debian.net/920006/
[07:54:16] <rominronin> Cork: *sort of*
[07:54:31] <Kadigan_KSB> Used to be a time that when someone asked me how they could do something in JS, I'd just tell them to come no closer to JS than a yardstick's length if he could help it...
[07:54:57] <Cork> <_<
[07:55:08] <Cork> i've been quite found of js for many many years
[07:55:16] <Cork> though i still don't want to run it on the server :P
[07:55:49] <Kadigan_KSB> Not me. I've seen it break a gazilion times since '98, and at some point I just stopped bothering to look it up - just went w/ flash, or whatever was good for interactivity at the time.
[07:55:53] <rominronin> i like js ONLY for the things I can't do with css
[07:56:15] <Cork> rominronin: that is the right way to do it
[07:57:02] <Kadigan_KSB> Still, the attitude on the web sure has changed over the years... Used to be you didn't do something that major browsers didn't support. Now, you just put it in and wait a month for the major players to catch up.
[07:57:31] <rominronin> cork maybe. but clients often demand features that are only achievable in time with js and jquery libraries
[07:57:37] <Kadigan_KSB> I guess it -has- to be that way, considering how many different things are now available, incl. mobiles...
[07:58:15] <Cork> rominronin: ya, sure, but even then you should try to keep it as css as much as possible
[07:58:18] <Kadigan_KSB> Has browser detection seen improvement? I remember it being flakey at best, and easily spoofable.
[07:58:28] <Cork> as the browser knows what happens there, so it is always much faster
[07:58:47] <realies> i've touched on this yesterday, but never got around how to make it better - https://dpaste.de/r5i7
[07:58:48] <Cork> Kadigan_KSB: ya, it has been deprecated and considered a really bad practice
[07:59:03] <realies> any way of not having to .toArray()?
[07:59:04] <Cork> now days feature detection is used instead
[07:59:15] <Cork> realies:  i told you this yesterday
[07:59:18] <Kadigan_KSB> Cork: makes sense...
[07:59:24] <rominronin> Kadigan_KSB: yeah. until I moved to Austria i never realised how language migth affect feature importance. css hyphens is my example: German words can get very long. hyphenation on mobile is necessary. css hyphens:auto is not supported by chrome or ie on windows - that's two very major browsers on that platform,
[07:59:36] <Cork> realies: use $.map not $().map
[07:59:50] <realies> oh, that'd give me a this from a jquery context?
[08:00:00] <rominronin>  in English we just pick a shorter word for titles and menu links, so it's 'fine'
[08:00:09] <rominronin> but in German, it's not always an option
[08:00:17] <Cork> realies: $.map does the same thing as $().map except $().map will wrap the result in a jquery object
[08:00:34] <Kadigan_KSB> rominronin: it's a bit of an issue on Polish websites as well, esp. when you get 'blessed' with a design from management living in another country... Bleh.
[08:00:36] <Cork> realies: so $.map($(), function(elm) { return this.... });
[08:01:22] <Kadigan_KSB> rominronin: in other words, "how can we translate this accurately within the space allotted?" :D Even -computer games- have gotten better about -that-...
[08:02:20] <Cork> Kadigan_KSB: on irc - mean strike over :)
[08:02:25] <Cork> i guess you mean _
[08:03:07] <rominronin> yeah, there are a great many more conservative (old fashioned) clients here in Austria, so explaining why their longer, more accurate word has to be replaced with a shorter, more generally applicable word, can be tough
[08:03:54] <MikeD_> can you present the options:  "shorter word or smaller font?" so they feel like they're helping to solve the problem rather than being told they can't have what they want
[08:04:07] <realies> Cork, but that'd need a .toArray() as well
[08:04:13] <Cork> no
[08:04:19] <Cork> $.map() returns an array
[08:04:46] <realies> thanks
[08:05:18] <rominronin> smaller font is the only real way to solve the problem without adding a lot of extra cost. hypens: auto goes in there by default, and one day the browsers will all support it. it just won't be a few months.
[08:05:36] <Cork> realies: https://jsfiddle.net/stwf5fwr/
[08:05:49] <realies> any performance difference between return $(elm).data ("id") and return elm.getAttribute("data-id")?
[08:05:57] <realies> I guess the latter doesn't call the jquery lib
[08:06:10] <realies> Cork, yes it works, thank you
[08:06:17] <MikeD_> overflow: ellipsis and title="superlonggermanwordenwurst"
[08:07:09] <Cork> rominronin: btw chrome has supported hypenation since 55
[08:07:16] <Cork> donno about ie though
[08:07:20] <Cork> (or edge)
[08:07:38] <MikeD_> also, get rid of all language - just use emoji - the Egyptians already solved this problem of limited real estate on tombs with heiroglyphs
[08:07:51] <Cork> lol
[08:08:34] <rominronin> Cork: http://caniuse.com/#search=hyphens
[08:08:53] <MikeD_> "Wait, is that a bird eating a snake?"  no, that's heiroglyph for the "feedback" link
[08:08:54] <rominronin> hyphens: auto support is *for now* only on mac, and that's the one that works
[08:09:08] <rominronin> MikeD_: LOL
[08:09:13] <Cork> rominronin: ya, read the description
[08:09:23] <Cork> 'Chrome < 55 and Android 4.0 Browser support "-webkit-hyphens: none", but not the "auto" property.'
[08:09:40] <Cork> aka. chrome >= 55 does support it
[08:16:16] <realies> when comparing arrays, do you need to do the opposite order as well as demonstrated here? http://jsfiddle.net/Vitzkrieg/SdkRZ/
[08:18:43] <realies> oh, not is a filter function
[08:19:19] <Cork> realies: $() isn't really for comparing numbers or strings though
[08:19:29] <Cork> it is for managing dom elements
[08:19:44] <Cork> your better of using $.inArray or one of the built in array methods
[08:22:02] <realies> Cork, but inArray expects a single value
[08:22:19] <Cork> yes so you have to make a nested loop check
[08:23:02] <Cork> realies: the .not() method your currently using is working by accident, and there is no guarantee what so ever it will keep working with future versions of jquery
[08:23:20] <Cork> as .not is meant to be used to filter dom elements, not arrays
[08:27:25] <Cork> realies: https://jsfiddle.net/52xaa0a8/
[08:27:45] <Cork> opps stray variable
[08:27:53] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/52xaa0a8/1/
[08:28:06] <realies> i was gonna say (JSON.stringify(arr1.sort()) === JSON.stringify(arr2.sort()));
[08:28:07] <realies> haha
[08:34:22] <MikeD_> what real use is there for comparing two arrays like that?
[08:34:46] <Cork> MikeD_: to know if two array matches
[08:35:13] <Cork> (i'm actually doing the exact same thing at the moment, in ruby though)
[08:35:23] <MikeD_> what kind of stuff would you have in two arrays that you'd want to check for 'match' ?
[08:35:55] <Cork> MikeD_: for me i get an array of fields with errors, and want to know what stage i'm based on what errors are in there
[08:36:15] <Cork> *stage i'm in based on*
[08:36:54] <Cork> (if your on stage 5 but you have errors from a field that exists in stage 1, you should be bumped back to stage 1)
[08:38:50] <MikeD_> so array A is 'all good' and array B is 'current state' and you're trying to see if 'current state' is 'all good' ?
[08:39:30] <Cork> MikeD_: i have an array of arrays, and loop over those arrays, checking if they match with the "current state"
[08:39:38] <MikeD_> sorry if I sound either dense or argumentative, i'm just not reasoning about the generic case without an instance example
[08:39:38] <Cork> if it does it means that is the state i should be in
[08:40:32] <Cork> another difference between my case and realies is that i do an or check (any of them) not all of them
[08:40:34] <MikeD_> heh, please tell me you have a comment or two for the maintenance programmer :)
[08:40:45] <Cork> but i can quite easily see that as a reason too
[08:40:58] <Cork> MikeD_: i am the maintenance programmer
[08:41:12] <Cork> and the check (in ruby) is actually a bit more complicated then i said
[08:42:25] <Cork> MikeD_: if you care to see https://paste.debian.net/920016/
[08:42:25] <MikeD_> so what do you think of the sort&stringify both array solution?
[08:42:48] <Cork> its an old hack
[08:43:09] <Cork> and it works as long as you don't need to have none native values (numbers and strings)
[08:43:24] <Cork> but if you for example need to store complex things like a dom element it blows up
[08:43:37] <Cork> so i tend to avoid it
[08:43:41] <MikeD_> yeah, and that you don't care about cheaper length checks skipping the majority of the work
[08:44:06] <Cork> it is also a bit costly both in the form of cpu and memory as you need to convert both arrays to strings and then compare the strings
[08:44:50] <Cork> and two nested for loops to do the fast checks are simple enough to write
[08:44:58] <Cork> so i don't see the point of doing it that way
[08:45:21] <MikeD_> in your paste, are steps 1/2 identified by index position since they're both blank?
[08:45:29] <MikeD_> 1 and 2
[08:45:49] <Cork> they are steps that are currently empty :)
[08:45:57] <Cork> haven't added fields there yet
[08:46:05] <Cork> it will come
[08:46:13] <MikeD_> kk, just curious
[08:46:32] <Cork> but ya i miss rubys [] & [] in js sometimes
[08:46:36] <Cork> gives nice syntax
[08:46:47] <MikeD_> Do you have additional metadata around prompting language for each step?
[08:47:12] <Cork> this code is just there to adjust the @guide_step variable
[08:47:26] <Cork> it doesn't do anything visible (it controls what visible things are visible though)
[08:47:33] <MikeD_> hehe
[08:48:04] <MikeD_> thanks
[08:48:11] <Cork> if you check the first line in the function it grabs the step from the input form
[08:48:15] <MikeD_> my team doesn't do enough code review / discussion
[08:48:20] <Cork> and then it makes sure you can actually be where you say you are
[08:48:22] <Cork> basically
[08:48:40] <MikeD_> enough = any
[08:48:52] <Cork> ya, that is a common problem
[08:49:04] <Cork> was like that here too when i started (11 years ago)
[08:49:20] <MikeD_> too bad really, because most of them aren't capable of thinking through the process of making a PB*J much less writing a whole app
[08:49:55] <Cork> and just the process of talking with someone about a code change most of the time result in making it better
[08:50:14] <Cork> heh, the person you talk with doesn't even always have to understand coding XD
[08:50:25] <MikeD_> rubber ducking, yup
[08:50:42] <Cork> heh that reminds me
[08:52:43] <Cork> damn i lost it...
[08:53:17] <MikeD_> that looks like a joke and a punchline
[08:54:00] <Cork> i have a link to a rubber duck debuggin site, but i can't find the damn bookmark right now
[08:54:11] <Cork> AH there it is http://duckie.me/
[08:58:21] <MikeD_> this is great
[08:58:47] <AndChat460649> Help
[08:59:21] <sonu> my this ajax call http://pastebin.com/98YaXW3q not returning anything .. console just showing me post data...but not any response in debugger
[08:59:58] <AndChat460649> Jquery 3.1 is not supporting searchable drop down.. How to use it
[09:00:03] <Cork> sonu: bind a .fail handler
[09:00:07] <AndChat460649> Jquery 3.0 and 3.1
[09:00:08] <Cork> you json might not parse
[09:00:33] <AndChat460649> Cork
[09:00:49] <Cork> searchable dropdown is that a jquery plugin?
[09:01:07] <sonu> Cork, this is working perfect with i am using ajax call from same domain . but from other domain it having issue.. not any thing in respose
[09:01:31] <AndChat460649> Yes cork it is jquery plugin
[09:01:34] <Cork> sonu: unless the server supports (and sends) cors headers you can't make ajax calls cross domains
[09:01:53] <Cork> AndChat460649: then you have to see if there is an updated version of the plugin that support jquery 3.x
[09:02:01] <Cork> AndChat460649: or use an older version of jquery
[09:02:21] <AndChat460649> But older jquery are vulnerable and that is 10.3
[09:02:27] <Cork> uh...
[09:02:28] <Cork> no
[09:02:40] <AndChat460649> Uses old browser too
[09:02:41] <Cork> there are three up to date versions of jquery
[09:02:48] <Cork> 1.x, 2.x and 3.x
[09:03:03] <Cork> they are all supported and up to date if you use the latest patch version
[09:03:31] <Cork> 1.x has ie < 9 support 2.x doesn't and 3.x is a rewrite
[09:03:36] <AndChat460649> Is it possible to use 3.x
[09:03:45] <Cork> sure, update the plugin to work with 3.x
[09:04:14] <AndChat460649> Using updated plugin but then it is freezing
[09:04:23] <AndChat460649> Downloaded updated jquery
[09:04:34] <Cork> sounds like the updated version still doesn't support 3.x
[09:04:50] <Cork> so you have to fix that, or use an older version of jquery
[09:05:02] <Cork> you can't tell jquery to somehow make the plugin compatible...
[09:05:10] <AndChat460649> Damn
[09:05:15] <Cork> <_<'
[09:05:16] <AndChat460649> Okay cork
[09:05:27] <Cork> you really thought it would be possible??
[09:05:44] <AndChat460649> Idk I thought there is some alternative for that
[09:05:58] <Cork> sure the alternative is to use the 1.x or 2.x serie
[09:06:06] <Cork> it is there among other things for this exact reason
[09:06:18] <AndChat460649> But then it is vulnerable
[09:06:21] <Cork> no
[09:06:23] <Cork> ... T_T
[09:07:14] <Cork> none vulnerable is not equal with "highest version number"
[09:07:47] <AndChat460649> Jquery.searchable drop down.js
[09:09:42] <AndChat460649> Thanks Cork
[09:11:34] <AndChat460649> Thought using latest jquery is like transforming to latest
[09:21:46] <sonu> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42810819/ajax-for-cross-domain-is-not-responding
[10:05:00] <Blendify_> so I have, https://ghostbin.com/paste/x4yek but I do not want anything to happen when you click on a link that is already clicked. How would I go about this?
[10:19:19] <some_David2> anyone has a minute to explain URL anchor tags?
[10:20:24] <some_David2> in some cases they do not change the URL when link is clicked, so how does they handle the request then if window.location.hash is useless in this case?
[10:33:56] <ep-wi> if I have a <LI> how can I grab the next <LI> in the <UL> the fastest?
[10:35:36] <ep-wi> if I have a <LI> how can I grab the next <LI> in the <UL> the fastest?
[11:07:37] <MikeD_> perhaps the not-really-cryptic .next() method
[11:21:56] <taplar> i like it when you create a new service and then a day or so later, they decide they don't need it any more
[11:23:42] <MikeD_> if not for the exercise in futility, I wouldn't get any exercise at all
[11:23:59] <taplar> heh
[12:00:14] <linuxcable23> helllo does anyone know about jspdf and then using a sharepoint rest api to save pdf files with out saving first to the users pc ?
[12:01:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:02:02] <taplar> i dunno about jspdf, but the sharepoint docs are shit
[12:02:09] <taplar> but either way, not sure how that relates to jquery
[12:03:19] <linuxcable23> well in jqurey could i create a var to save the pdf and then put it into an upload field for a user or is that something that will not work ?
[12:03:42] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:03:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't make vars in jquery fwiw.
[12:03:53] <robertmaxrees> you make them in js :)
[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> also: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn769086.aspx
[12:06:16] <taplar> ever since i had to deal with sharepoint, any time someone brings up uploading pdfs and crap i keep suggesting just sticking them in the db as a blob, lol
[12:06:28] <taplar> traumatic experience
[12:07:33] <linuxcable23> ok so a blob should work if i save my pdf to that and then call the blob in the rest api i am guessing
[13:57:32] <ntman4real> hello all.  Anyone on?  Have a semi-simple question
[13:57:48] <taplar> just ask man
[13:57:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:57:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:58:30] <ntman4real> ok thanks.  So I just want to know how I can use an external RSS feed for my site using this jquery script.  http://www.jqueryscript.net/slider/Responsive-jQuery-News-Ticker-Plugin-with-Bootstrap-3-Bootstrap-News-Box.html
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> that page shows you.
[13:59:23] <robertmaxrees> note that the external feed has to allow CORS.
[13:59:50] <ntman4real> It shows static population but where would I put the external RSS URL?  I tried feedUrl: 'http://...' in the function to no avail
[14:00:47] <robertmaxrees> this assumes you're render it out to the page first, instead of having the plugin do it.
[14:00:58] <robertmaxrees> but again, in lots of cases you won't be able to use an external feed.
[14:01:53] <ntman4real> ok so I need to render it first?
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> per those docs, yeah.
[14:09:43] <vacho> I am trying to unselect a select-dropdown by $('input[type=select][name=public_debt_rating][option]').prop('selected', false);
[14:09:46] <vacho> but it's not working
[14:10:25] <robertmaxrees> gotta set the val.
[14:10:32] <taplar> [option] ?
[14:10:44] <vacho> taplar: i tried without, and still does not work
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ also that.  the selector is way wonk.
[14:10:53] <taplar> no, i was asking what that is meant to do
[14:11:06] <vacho> $('input[type=select][name=public_debt_rating]').val('')
[14:11:24] <vacho> tried that too, no luck.
[14:11:30] <taplar> i'd recommend setting the name also as the class and just select on that
[14:11:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:11:38] <robertmaxrees> input type="select"?
[14:11:59] <robertmaxrees> you want $('select');
[14:12:08] <vacho> $('select[name=public_debt_rating]')
[14:12:11] <vacho> let me try that
[14:12:16] <taplar> use a class man
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:12:53] <vacho> $('select[name=public_debt_rating] option').prop('selected', false);
[14:12:55] <vacho> thanks, that worked
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:13:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:13:08] <vacho> is this not a good way? $('select[name=public_debt_rating] option').prop('selected', false);
[14:13:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a nasty selector.
[14:13:21] <taplar> you know how you tell kids something is hot and they touch it anyway?
[14:13:23] <vacho> robertmaxrees: what is nasty about it?
[14:13:23] <robertmaxrees> give it a class instead, yo.
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> don't select on attributes.
[14:13:33] <robertmaxrees> use classes/IDs.
[14:13:36] <vacho> I will give it  class, but what is the difference?
[14:13:42] <vacho> robertmaxrees: ok will do..but I just want to know why :)
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> speed.  readability.
[14:13:55] <taplar> your browser is geared to lookup ids and classes super fast
[14:14:09] <vacho> taplar: does it matter on todays computers?
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.theSelectIWant') vs $('select[name="someLongNameHere"]');
[14:14:21] <robertmaxrees> which of those is easier to read?
[14:14:31] <vacho> this is giving me job security since it's not very readable
[14:14:34] <taplar> you should always try to learn best practices
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> vacho newp.
[14:14:47] <taplar> and 'computers' is very generic.  pcs, mobile devices.  performance varies
[14:14:48] <robertmaxrees> that actually jeopardizes your future.
[14:15:09] <vacho> ok, I will use an ID
[14:15:24] <robertmaxrees> purposefully writing code that's harder to read is a great way to make people not like you.
[14:15:31] <taplar> lol
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:22:51] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to retrieve images from a web-based quiz in bulk for migration to a different system, but some of the images have the same filenames while being different images. I've written a script to the identifies the images and sets them up with an anchor configured with the download attribute and a modified filename to make each name unique. But the download attribute seems to be ignored. I've already confirmed that the URLs of the
[14:22:51] <tsukasadt> images are on the same domain/protocol/port as the page the anchor is being generated on, so the cross-domain blocking shouldn't apply. The script works perfectly beyond the download attribute being ignored. I've tried a pure JavaScript version of the script with the same results. Could anyone tell me what I've done wrong? https://thepasteb.in/p/Y6hJcVorl7O57cn
[14:25:53] <taplar> what is the download attribute supossed to do?
[14:27:00] <taplar> because your browser is going to prevent some link logic for links that are 'clicked' by a program rather than the actual user
[14:27:19] <tsukasadt> In HTML5 is forces the anchor to trigger a download of the hyperlink reference using the default name if not new name is provided.
[14:27:31] <taplar> yeah, you probably can't do that
[14:33:27] <tsukasadt> taplar, it does seem to work programmatically. I simplified it to test and it worked with the Google logo. I'm thinking this may not be an issue with my script but the server. :S
[14:35:34] <tsukasadt> Yeah, I think it's the server. I just tested the simplified script on the one I'm actually trying to pull images from and it's not working. So, it's not a jQuery/JavaScript issue. Sorry to waste your time. ^^'
[14:35:44] <robertmaxrees> mime type and header controls that kind of stuf iirc.
[14:38:06] <tsukasadt> I'll have to ask an HTML support room if the would affect it, but all the images loaded in the browser at the proper MIME type, so I doubt that's the cause.
[14:38:28] <robertmaxrees> heh you'd be surprised about mime types vs extensions and what some browsers will tolerate.
[14:39:12] <tsukasadt> Well, if it were the MIME type, the PNGs wouldn't be listed in the Developer Tools with a png type.
[14:41:06] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.  combo of factors.
[14:41:40] <tsukasadt> Yeah, trouble is figuring what they are. I REALLY don't feeling like manually downloading and renaming 784 images.
[14:42:17] <robertmaxrees> why do this via js btw?
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> seems like an odd choice.
[14:43:24] <tsukasadt> How else would I bulk download all images on the page?
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> quick python script.
[14:43:46] <tsukasadt> I don't know Python. :(
[14:43:56] <robertmaxrees> quick and easy to figure out :)
[14:44:04] <robertmaxrees> could also do something with node + phantomjs.
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> lots of options,.
[14:44:47] <robertmaxrees> hell i build a meta tag scraping service in python.  whole app is like 101 lines iirc.
[14:45:59] <tsukasadt> Hmmm, odd, the MIME when directly accessing the images is "document" but when embedded as an image is correct.
[14:46:17] <robertmaxrees> might use curl to check that one.
[15:19:19] <MikeD_> any idea why .draggable() makes a div stick to the mouse and never actually stop dragging?
[15:25:57] <MikeD_> ... well, clicking on the scrollbar and dragging the scroll indicator caused unwanted behavior, using the handle property of the option object makes the problem go away
[15:35:26] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, taplar, I think I got it using a roundabout process in pure JavaScript (doesn't seem to work in jQuery). Basically I'm converting the image to a canvas, then to a data URL, and that gets downloaded.
[15:35:48] <taplar> sure
[15:42:55] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, taplar, Confirmed that this worked with the bulk script. Thanks for helping me figure out where the problem was. :)
[16:17:31] <realisation> I have two jquery modals, the first one being pretty tiny, but that has an option to open up another modal to complete a separate function. When that second modal opens (after the first closes), it's a much larger modal and has a problem that the scroll function is not working, so it is being cut off at the bottom.
[16:17:58] <robertmaxrees> realisation why have two modals?
[16:18:00] <realisation> I can fix it from the console by calling .modal().show() on it, but when I'm at a loss of how to make this automatic
[16:18:09] <realisation> two separate functons, just the way it is right now
[16:18:31] <robertmaxrees> i might consider replacing the current modal's contents.
[16:18:40] <realisation> I just need a quick fix for now
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap?
[16:19:03] <robertmaxrees> or jqui?
[16:19:12] <realisation> I tried adding a data attribute isOpen and calling .modal().show() a second time on opening the particular second modal, but that didn't do anything. although it's the same code from the console
[16:19:45] <realisation>  it is a bootstrap modal that has some jquery .modal() implementations
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:05] <robertmaxrees> still bootstrap.  either way, you can bind to the modal's "shown" event.
[16:20:34] <realisation> I have to avoid a stack overflow, how would I do that?
[16:21:09] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-events
[16:21:31] <realisation> I feel like .calling show() from the console is fixing some other aspect that for whatever reason isn't being set properly on the initial hiding of the other modal/showing of the modal in question
[16:21:44] <robertmaxrees> well...
[16:21:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah - the docs even say to not open multiple modals at the same time: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
[16:22:00] <robertmaxrees> first warning note there.
[16:22:10] <realisation> right, it shouldn't be doing that though
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> correct, because opening multiple modals isn't supported.
[16:22:28] <realisation> however of course the event listeners are just kind of thrown in there
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> you're doing something that the library itself tells you to avoid :)
[16:22:49] <realisation> well no not necessarily, it is closing one and showing another
[16:23:00] <realisation> but technically it might not sous out that way
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> might have to wait until the first one closes.
[16:23:25] <robertmaxrees> or just replace the contents of the current one and make the contents scrollable.
[16:23:53] <realisation> icic I can just use an on closed event same as a shown event
[16:24:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:26:27] <realisation> thanks for you help
[16:26:37] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[16:46:43] <jak2000> hi all, jquery-ui have a control for drag from a list to other?
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> docs have an example of that iirc.
[16:53:13] <jak2000> wich?
[16:53:14] <jak2000> pls
[16:54:04] <robertmaxrees> ui.jquery.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[16:56:28] <jak2000> ooo i need this exactly :)
[16:56:28] <jak2000> https://johnny.github.io/jquery-sortable/
[16:56:43] <jak2000> robertmaxrees.....
[16:56:45] <jak2000> thanks
[17:01:27] <jak2017> working
[17:06:02] <robertmaxrees> jak2017 what do you need modified?
[17:06:05] <robertmaxrees> we can help you for free in here.
[17:06:13] <robertmaxrees> instead of PMing people hoping for a response.
[17:06:26] <jak2017> robertmaxrees shhh
[17:06:31] <jak2017> ok i tell here
[17:58:21] <zenox> gah there are so many flat-file markdown "cms's" around. too many to view
[18:16:22] <qakhan> hi all, is it right syntex    if ($('#status').is(":checked")? 1 : 0);
[18:17:22] <taplar> is() returns a boolean
[18:18:06] <qakhan> I want to use if statment like that
[18:18:18] <taplar> but why?  why have a ternary?
[18:18:32] <taplar> your saying if ( true ? 1 : 0 )
[18:18:40] <qakhan> yes
[18:18:48] <taplar> if it's true, then 1, which is true
[18:18:54] <taplar> if false, then 0, which is false
[18:18:55] <qakhan> yes
[18:18:59] <taplar> just use the is()
[18:19:26] <qakhan> how can you please give me example?
[18:19:35] <taplar> i just explained it
[18:19:48] <taplar> you already have the true/false from the is().  there's not reason for the ternary
[18:19:57] <taplar> not/no
[18:20:54] <qakhan> $('#status')  is checkbox. i want to see it checkbox is checked then 1 else 0
[18:21:27] <taplar> with the if that you have if you take off the ? 1 : 0 it will literally function exactly the same
[18:21:34] <taplar> re-read what i said for why
[18:23:29] <qakhan>    if ($('#status').is()? true : false);
[18:23:33] <qakhan> not working
[20:16:10] <dglambert> yo yo
[20:21:11] <dglambert> Hey, what is the criteria to have a ajax call fail()
[20:21:50] <dglambert> Does status code account for failuer?
[20:48:26] <shoky_> yup
