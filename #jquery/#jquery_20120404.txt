[00:31:09] <raj> with history.js, do I use regular js/$ to detect if the back button is hit? and then do things accordingly with that? or does history.js have an event for that?
[00:33:13] <poppiez> will a form stop submitting if you remove the form element?
[00:33:49] <coldhead> probably not
[00:37:38] <poppiez> coldhead: thx :)

[00:46:15] <yamama> Hello. Is there a plugin that allows zooming and panning on an image, and to insert markers / refresh the markers when changing zoom or pan ?
[00:47:53] <Eviltwin> Not that I'm aware of but it shouldn't be *too* hard
[00:50:02] <yamama> Eviltwin: I agree. i'm just in a bit of rush, hence the question. Found  Shiftzoom.js, on which i could add qtip2. Wondering if there were any better options
[00:58:05] <nights``> hm
[00:58:42] <nights``> anyone know how to use ajaxStart and ajaxStop for various elements of a form without having them activate more than one panel at a time?
[00:59:00] <nights``> like for a specific ajax event
[00:59:11] <Cork> you would have to build your own mutex
[00:59:30] <Cork> like a value on the form you check if something else is shown
[01:00:20] <nights``> hm
[01:00:46] <nights``> but that will only work if i know which ajax event was sent?
[01:00:58] <Cork> no
[01:01:03] <nights``> so it comes down to me being able to indentify the ajax event no??
[01:01:14] <Cork> why would it?
[01:01:30] <nights``> i mean, otherwise if you just randomly take the mutex
[01:01:40] <nights``> how do you know that the right element snatched it?
[01:02:06] <Cork> the mutex is to block the other not to direct to how should see it
[01:02:07] <nights``> unless your solution depend on the answer from ajax
[01:02:25] <Cork> *who
[01:02:35] <nights``> yeah, but say that we have three divs 1, 2, 3  and  three ajax calls, A B C
[01:03:04] <nights``> if I call B then 2 should get activated; what i mean by activiated is basically show/hide
[01:03:25] <Cork> nights``: set the context for the ajax call
[01:03:27] <nights``> however, right now, any of the A|B|C would activate all 1 2 3
[01:03:34] <nights``> how?
[01:03:41] <Cork> ?.ajax
[01:03:41] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[01:03:50] <Cork> "context"
[01:04:05] <bittyx-work> hi all, i'm having a bit of a problem with ariel flesler's jquery.preload plugin. i preload some images using the plugin (backgrounds for some divs that are initially hidden), and i can confirm through firebug's net panel that they are, in fact, being downloaded correctly. however, when i show the initially hidden div, the images get requested from the server again, as if they weren't preloaded at all. what gives?
[01:04:56] <Cork> bittyx-work: the images show in the net pannel yes
[01:05:03] <nights``> Cork: i see what you mean....then maybe thats sufficient and i dont need ajaxStart/Stop at all?
[01:05:11] <Cork> bittyx-work: but they should be marked as loaded from cache
[01:05:11] <nights``> just so convinient
[01:05:25] <Cork> nights``: yes
[01:06:27] <bittyx-work> Cork: nope, i can see that the requests actually take place (and i can also visually confirm that the image isn't visible at the same moment when the div is shown, but a few moments later, after it downloads)
[01:06:53] <bittyx-work> Cork: i have an online test, if you would like to check
[01:07:01] <Cork> bittyx-work: sure
[01:07:02] <bittyx-work> Cork: mind if i pm you the url?
[01:07:17] <Cork> go ahead
[01:08:07] <raj> I've got an object such as `var myobj = {'test':'test', 'checked_items':['1stthing','2ndthing','anotherthing']}`, however, when I try making a query parameter out of this with $.param(myobj), it's returning `test=test&checked_items%5B%5D=1stthing&&checked_items%5B%5D
[01:08:19] <raj> =2ndthing
[01:08:23] <raj> ...etc
[01:08:34] <bittyx-work> Cork: pm'd. you can see, for example, the frame-video.png - the background for the menu that drops down when you click the "video" link in the navigation bar
[01:08:52] <raj> I was expecting checked_items=1stthing,2ndthing,anotherthing
[01:09:04] <bittyx-work> Cork: the image gets loaded once by $.preload(), but it gets requested again when the container div drops down and actually shows it
[01:09:05] <raj> and in fact, if I had spaces in there, I plan on making them _
[01:09:37] <bittyx-work> Cork: i've even tried setting preload's enforceCache option to true, but to no avail
[01:09:49] <raj> plus, I have no idea why the [ and ] are being encoded to %5B and %5D, and why they are sitting right next to the key
[01:10:11] <nights``> cork: which is the better pair to use for activaiting a loading div?
[01:10:18] <Cork> bittyx-work: "Response Headers From Cache"
[01:10:19] <nights``> beforeSend / complete
[01:10:20] <nights``> or
[01:10:24] <nights``> beforeSend / success ?
[01:10:25] <Cork> it loads from cache for me
[01:11:05] <bittyx-work> Cork: which browser are you using? maybe it's my firefox that fails to do the right thing?
[01:11:16] <Cork> bittyx-work: not though that modern browser discards the decoding, and that has to happen before it can render it
[01:11:31] <Cork> bittyx-work: that message was from ff11
[01:11:42] <Cork> but i get the same from chrome
[01:12:04] <bittyx-work> Cork: what do you mean by "discards the decoding"? i'm not sure i understand...
[01:12:06] <Cork> and yes you get network trafic as it checks if the image has changed
[01:12:18] <bittyx-work> (actually, i'm sure i don't understand)
[01:12:24] <Cork> bittyx-work: you have the following steps a browser does:
[01:12:25] <Slydder> hey all. I am trying to get a drag and drop box working but am having problems because the box I am wanting to drag has other divs in it that are selected instead of the parent div which encloses all that I am wanting to drag and drop. anyone have an idea how I can get this working?
[01:13:07] <bittyx-work> Slydder: copy/paste the selector you use to initialize the .draggable or whatever
[01:13:36] <bittyx-work> Slydder: i'm betting you're doing something like $('#some-id div') instead of $('#some-id > div') or $('#divs-id')
[01:13:45] <Cork> bittyx-work: 1) it requests the image from the server 2) it stors it in cache (disk or memory) 3) it prepares to draw the image 4) it decodes the png/jpg/what ever to raw pixel data 4) it renders it 5) if ts not needed in a certen amount of time it throws it away
[01:14:09] <Cork> bittyx-work: so 3-5 happens each time the image is drawn unless its within a certen amount of time
[01:14:34] <Slydder> bittyx-work: here is what I currently have. http://pastie.org/3725548
[01:14:37] <Cork> if the image is offscreen or hidden its not drawn so ...
[01:14:37] <coldhead> it's sad how it's thrown away
[01:15:16] <bittyx-work> Cork: but isn't the whole point of preloading precisely to make the browser download images before they are shown, so that when they do get shown, they get shown immediately?
[01:15:17] <Slydder> as you can see trying to select the div "breaking-news" will not work because of the other divs on top of it.
[01:15:37] <Cork> bittyx-work: its to make the image be stored in cache
[01:15:38] <slebbo> I am a jquery (and javascript) beginner, wonder if there
[01:15:44] <Cork> to not the the network load
[01:15:59] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: If you remember from yesterday, here's my code with the table selection row/cols http://pastie.org/3721030 The Mage:: part is where my table is instantiated and doesn't work on that one, or on the tables returned by AJAX… what am I doing wrong
[01:16:11] <raj> Cork, whenever you get a chance, I've got a couple query param questions
[01:16:11] <Cork> bittyx-work: the rendering delay is depending on the amount of memory the user has
[01:16:21] <bittyx-work> Cork: ah, okay - so my problem is still that the preloaded images, even though they are in the cache, get downloaded again anyway when the div is shown first
[01:16:33] <Cork> bittyx-work: no
[01:16:44] <Cork> they get loaded from cache and redecoded again
[01:16:51] <slebbo> there is a smart way in jquery to show a specific picture in a period of time?
[01:16:51] <Cork> not redownloaded
[01:17:01] <Cork> check the responce from the server its 304
[01:17:16] <bittyx-work> Cork: but that's what i'm saying - i'm not getting 304 not modified, but 200 ok again
[01:17:27] <Cork> uh...
[01:17:32] <bittyx-work> Cork: and i can tell by the timeline and network traffic that images are indeed loaded again
[01:17:37] <Cork> then it looks like you have a wierd cache setting
[01:18:00] <Cork> try a clean firefox profile
[01:18:05] <slebbo> like; ”2012-01-01 to 2012-04-04 show: spring.jpg"
[01:18:36] <bittyx-work> Cork: okay, i'll do that, thanks. i just wanted to see if i was doing something wrong, or misunderstanding how preloading is supposed to work
[01:19:02] <Cork> bittyx-work: nope and for me it does what i would expect it to do (on your page)
[01:19:36] <Nece228> hello
[01:19:41] <Cork> slebbo: so have an if statement that use different urls
[01:19:45] <Nece228> can anyone explain why my stupid code doesnt work?
[01:19:46] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/88761544
[01:20:00] <slebbo> but it
[01:20:18] <Cork> ?p @ Nece228
[01:20:18] <bot-t> Nece228, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:20:18] <slebbo> how do i define the timeperiod with the time-object?
[01:20:30] <Cork> and include everything that matters for your question
[01:20:52] <coldhead> the good news is your stupid code DOES work Nece228 http://jsfiddle.net/tymbm/
[01:20:53] <Cork> including where you bind the element, how the html looks like and things like that
[01:20:59] <coldhead> so perhaps you are not including jQuery?
[01:21:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: If you remember from yesterday, here's my code with the table selection row/cols http://pastie.org/3721030 The Mage:: part is where my table is instantiated and doesn't work on that one, or on the tables returned by AJAX… what am I doing wrong. It works in the fiddle so it's obviously something I've got wrong here?
[01:21:02] <coldhead> or your ID is wrong?
[01:21:24] <bittyx-work> Cork: cool, thanks a lot for trying it out. i'll do some research to see what's wrong with my firefox cache handling. bye.
[01:22:18] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to get your head around async and server and client side
[01:22:18] <coldhead> bye bittyx
[01:22:29] <Nece228> coldhead: well thats my html file: http://paste.opensuse.org/65625407
[01:22:36] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: feels like we've had this discusion numerus times
[01:23:03] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: when you bind the listners on an element it needs to exist
[01:23:18] <Cork> if you later add it through ajax it will be a different element
[01:23:37] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so if you want it to still work use delegated event listners
[01:23:38] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Really? If the table is rendered on page-load by Mage::… whatever then including the selector script after that should work no? Ignoring the ajax for a sec
[01:24:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: its still ajax
[01:24:18] <Cork> that means its not part of the code when it renders
[01:24:28] <Cork> its added dynamically afterwards
[01:24:44] <Cork> oh wait
[01:24:48] <Cork> you mean that part
[01:24:51] <fRAiLtY-> It's not lol
[01:24:52] <fRAiLtY-> Yep
[01:24:58] <Cork> ya sure the first table should work
[01:25:06] <fRAiLtY-> Exactly.. doesn't :D
[01:25:08] <fRAiLtY-> No JS errors
[01:25:28] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: when i checked it yesterday the table bound was replaced so its another one in code
[01:25:36] <Nece228> coldhead: it doesnt work i dont know why doesnt even matter how hard you try
[01:25:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i checked what table refered to and it was a table not in page
[01:26:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and i told you to initiate table on each change event to grab the current one
[01:27:52] <Slydder> hey all. I am trying to get a drag and drop box working but am having problems because the box I am wanting to drag has other divs in it that are selected instead of the parent div which encloses all that I am wanting to drag and drop. anyone have an idea how I can get this working? http://pastie.org/3725548
[01:30:43] <Slydder> got it
[01:34:50] <vectorshelve> Cork: how is the taggloud working here.. its so awesome.. -> http://techblog.daveastels.com/2006/10/29/rspec-on-rails/
[01:36:19] <vectorshelve> Its flash
[01:36:40] <Cork> taggloud you mean the tagcloud?
[01:38:12] <Cork> vectorshelve: but ya, its flash though there is nothing in it that can't be done with modern canvas
[01:38:25] <Nece228> coldhead: i still cant figure that out
[01:39:01] <vectorshelve> Cork: Can I do something similar using jquery ? no right... :( but its so awesome :)
[01:39:36] <Cork> vectorshelve: well to some degree
[01:39:40] <vectorshelve> Cork: You must have seen better tag clouds.. any refernces for my app will be welcomed.. Its static now
[01:39:57] <Cork> you would have to have a lot of absolute positioned elements and moved them around in zorder and things
[01:40:03] <Cork> but its defenitly doable
[01:40:08] <xec> Nece228: wrap it in a docready
[01:40:21] <xec> Nece228: or include your script after the button
[01:40:25] <vectorshelve> Cork: yes but using jquery it wouldnt be as cool as it looks using flash :)
[01:40:29] <Nece228> xec: ok lemme try
[01:40:37] <vectorshelve> any best jquery tag clouds you have seen ?
[01:42:09] <Nece228> xec: thanks, it works now. didnt knew that document ready is required

[01:46:30] <xec> Nece228: doesnt look like it's working to me, jQuery is not loaded, there is no element with ID "button" etc ;)
[01:46:33] <vectorshelve> nFFF: I meant what did you search for that led you to the page

[01:50:45] <Larholm> that's a jquery/canvas tagcloud thingy-majick, took me 5 seconds on google to find
[01:51:23] <Nece228> yeah
[01:51:38] <Nece228> anyways its working i can guarantee you like one hundred percents
[01:52:16] <vectorshelve> Larholm: html 5 :)

[01:58:39] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What do you mean? The table is there on page load… ?
[01:58:55] <fRAiLtY-> Then after it is something referring to the table.. is that wrong?
[01:59:21] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: at least when i checked yesterday its replaced directly after load though
[02:00:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: compare table[0] with $('#forgot the id')[0]
[02:00:15] <fRAiLtY-> Only if selections are selected. As standard it's just there. Check http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing as I'm confused :x
[02:00:18] <Cork> its not the same element
[02:01:44] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes but before the event for line 745 runs async to that the table is replaced
[02:02:04] <fRAiLtY-> Are you just doing plain view-source?
[02:02:04] <Cork> so the table variable points to a table that isn't visible
[02:02:09] <Cork> no
[02:02:20] <Cork> i'm puting a breakpoint at line 745
[02:02:40] <fRAiLtY-> … so bottom line what do I need to do to get it to work?
[02:02:43] <Cork> and table[0] !== jQuery('#300gsm-gloss-flyers')[0]
[02:03:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to wait for the ajax call (where ever it is) to complete BEFORE you do the rest
[02:03:14] <Cork> what you have now is racy
[02:03:34] <Cork> then you need to grab the new table and use that instead of the old
[02:04:21] <fRAiLtY-> But the first table is not loaded by AJAX...
[02:04:41] <Cork> so?
[02:04:52] <fRAiLtY-> So it should work on the first table??
[02:04:53] <Cork> its replaces, when its replaced the old table doesn't matter
[02:05:08] <Cork> it should work untill you change the options yes
[02:05:10] <Cork> and it does
[02:05:49] <Cork> as soon as you change #attribute129 it breaks cause then its all useing a table that isn't visiblel anymore
[02:06:00] <Cork> *visible
[02:06:03] <fRAiLtY-> But when I change the first option, the table isn't changed.. it's the same table? Ajax only comes into play on the 3rd drop-down. So making a change on the 1st and 2nd drop-downs shouldn't have an effect, as they're attribute127 and 128..
[02:06:28] <Cork> sure, and its only then that the code that changes markings act
[02:06:41] <fRAiLtY-> Oh wait I see
[02:06:43] <fRAiLtY-> twat
[02:06:44] <Cork> they explicitly listen on 129 and 130
[02:06:47] <fRAiLtY-> Grrr!
[02:06:54] <fRAiLtY-> Need a holiday :x
[02:07:21] <fRAiLtY-> See where I've gone wrong now, got my attributes wrong :x
[02:07:25] <fRAiLtY-> wrong numbers lol
[02:07:29] <Cork> lol
[02:07:35] <fRAiLtY-> god.. thank god it's a long weekend
[02:07:47] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry :P
[02:07:51] * fRAiLtY- feels silly
[02:08:32] <vectorshelve> when I do dom=document.getElementById('question_description_ifr').content in the firebug console. I get undefined :-/
[02:09:38] <vectorshelve> Cork: ^^ what's wrong ?
[02:10:47] <vectorshelve> when I do dom=document.getElementById('question_description_ifr')  returns and iframe butdocument.getElementById('question_description_ifr').content returns undefined
[02:11:38] <PavelloZ> wow, iframe content, serious hacking in the horizon ;)
[02:12:33] <Cork> vectorshelve: if i remember correctly its contentDocument not content
[02:12:55] <vectorshelve> Cork: ok will try with contentDocument thanks
[02:13:06] <Cork> or you could just do $('#question_description_ifr').contents()
[02:14:34] <vectorshelve> Cork: ok
[02:15:02] <vectorshelve> Cork: I am trying to type text into tinymce editor using selenium IDE.. hell of time.. nothing working for me
[02:15:28] <Cork> vectorshelve: have you checked so it doesn't have an api?
[02:15:43] <Cork> tinymce that is
[02:17:38] <vectorshelve> Cork: tried this -> http://rakeshloki.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/input-text-into-tinymce-text-area-using-selenium-rc/ and this -> http://nickbartlett.com/wordpress/selenium-ide-and-tinymce/ neither works

[02:24:19] <Woet> itatitat: and did you test it on jsfiddle?
[02:24:27] <Woet> itatitat: because you didn't even select jquery on the left.
[02:24:42] <Woet> itatitat: missing HTML too.
[02:24:57] <itatitat> ah!; okok, I can test it, thanks
[02:25:20] <Cork> itatitat: the code looks valid though, so its a start :)
[02:29:12] <vectorshelve> Cork: any luck for me ? :) with selenium
[02:30:34] <Turbohao> is it possible to get the background color of a canvas element?i have a gradient bg, i tried with context.getImageData(x, y, 1, 1).data but i always get 0
[02:30:44] <Turbohao> x and y are the mousecoördinates
[02:32:44] <nights``> cork: does "success" or "beforeSend" in anyway override the "update" behaivour?
[02:33:55] <aro> has anyone used paul irish's infinite scroll? how do you submit the ajhax request
[02:36:06] <aro> is it just psuedo ajax or can you use it with ajax requests
[02:39:46] <deacs> Hey
[02:40:52] <deacs> is anyone availbale for helping a noob with jQuery.get function
[02:42:46] <vishrayne> ajax callback stuff rite ?
[02:43:42] <aro> no
[02:43:53] <aro> i think i got it
[02:43:54] <aro> :)
[02:45:47] <deacs> yeah thats right
[02:46:36] <deacs> looking to update a part of my page with  mysql
[02:46:42] <vishrayne> deacs, what's your issue ?
[02:47:56] <deacs> well i have basicly no knowlegde of jquery/ajax - i have a page with a list of items in my database (by name of id), and underneath that i would like to show the entire contents of the db table without having to refresh the entire page
[02:48:13] <vishrayne> ok
[02:48:42] <deacs> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[02:48:46] <deacs> i have read this page
[02:49:06] <deacs> except I though i need to download the jquery plugin before i can start coding
[02:49:21] <deacs> or am i lost in my train of thought?
[02:50:19] <vishrayne> just follow the guide, like the example something like this might help you sort out ur issue "$.get("test.php", function(data){
[02:50:19] <vishrayne> alert("Data Loaded: " + data);
[02:50:19] <vishrayne> });"
[02:50:52] <deacs> mkay but like i said - dont i need to download a jquery plug in?
[02:51:04] <deacs> before i can start writing js code
[02:51:09] <vishrayne> nope just the jquery library
[02:51:22] <deacs> how do i acces the jquery library?
[02:51:35] <poppiez> how do you use $.ajax when one of the input fields is of type file?
[02:51:42] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Here's a good one, I've swapped out my attribute id's and it selects nicely now.. just.. the wrong thing.. ? lol http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[02:52:03] <vishrayne> deacs, either put this to ur page -> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[02:52:08] <Cork> poppiez: depends on how old the browser is, if it doesn't have the File api, you don't
[02:52:17] <vishrayne> or download and include latest jquery.min.js
[02:52:28] <deacs> ah ok
[02:52:36] <deacs> that is the entire jquery library?
[02:52:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I *think* it's because it starts off selected when it shouldn't..  and it seems to offset maybe?
[02:52:50] <poppiez> Cork: so I'd have to use something like jquery.form.js?
[02:52:51] <vishrayne> nope the essential kinda stuff
[02:53:00] <deacs> ok thanks alot
[02:53:08] <vishrayne> :)
[02:53:41] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ugg you have the choos an Option as the first in the select
[02:53:56] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so... make the classes start at 1 not 0 and it should work fine :/
[02:54:10] <deacs> vishrayne, does that go anywhere on the page or must it be put in the head?
[02:54:17] <Cork> (remove the +1 on line 752 too)
[02:54:42] <Xotix> Can't i do .focus(function() {})?
[02:54:49] <vishrayne> head
[02:54:53] <Cork> Xotix: you can
[02:54:54] <deacs> thanks mate
[02:55:00] <vishrayne> no probs
[02:55:31] <Xotix> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/6wKc5/ so what's wrong here? tested in chrome
[02:56:28] <Cork> Xotix: don't put things thats not in body in the html section
[02:56:43] <Xotix> Cork what?
[02:56:51] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6wKc5/1/
[02:57:09] <Cork> you get <html><head></head><body><html><head>...
[02:57:10] <Xotix> ah
[02:57:32] <Xotix> anyway, still doesn't work :)
[02:58:33] <Cork> Xotix: alert($("*:focus").attr("id")); won't ever work :)
[02:58:47] <Cork> it will always be focus on the button "show ID for Focused Item"
[02:58:56] <Cork> (as it get s focus when you click it)
[02:59:26] <Xotix> Cork, the anon. function never get's called. Cork, I'm setting the focus to the div after the click
[02:59:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6wKc5/2/
[02:59:59] <Cork> Xotix: you'r mixing up event listner and trigger
[03:00:01] <Xotix> Cork, i know the second button doesn't work. The problem is about the focus the div button
[03:00:29] <Cork> .focus(function() {}); is the same as .on('focus', function() {});
[03:00:36] <Xotix> Cork, it's simpel. onClick I'm setting the focus to the div and get the ID of the new focused element.
[03:00:39] <Cork> .focus(); is the same as .trigger('focus');
[03:00:59] <Cork> Xotix: check the last fiddle link
[03:01:22] <Xotix> so focus(function() {}); is like bind? it calls function when div get's focused?
[03:01:31] <Cork> yes
[03:01:56] <Cork> its the same as click() and mousemove and so on
[03:02:15] <Xotix> ups, nice mistake, thanks
[03:03:27] <Cork> Xotix: those functions is just shorthands for (was .bind not its .on)
[03:03:38] <incidence> Hello. I'm making my own jQuery plugin, how can I use other already loaded jquery plugins in mine? $.colorbox -> like, when calling colorbox I get: "has no method 'colorbox'"
[03:03:40] <Cork> so its not "like" bind it is bind
[03:04:12] <Xotix> .on('focus' function() is an alias for bind, isn't it?
[03:04:19] <Cork> oposit
[03:04:24] <Xotix> having the paras set like that
[03:04:25] <Cork> bind points to .on
[03:04:35] <Xotix> ah, possible
[03:04:38] <Xotix> sure?
[03:04:42] <Cork> everything goes through .on and .off nowdays
[03:05:05] <Xotix> thought on links to bind if you have set the params like that, hmm. Anyway, thanks!
[03:05:42] <Cork> Xotix: bind: function( types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, null, data, fn ); }, unbind: function( types, fn ) { return this.off( types, null, fn ); },
[03:06:04] <Xotix> hm ok thanks :)
[03:06:30] <Cork> same for delegate, undelegate live and die
[03:07:12] <avidal_> is it possible to set the element that will be selected when tab is pressed?
[03:07:25] <nlogax> check out the tabindex attribute, avidal_
[03:07:31] <avidal_> cheers
[03:07:59] <Cork> avidal_: or you can use the event from when the tab changes and use .focus()
[03:08:03] <Renari> Would anyone be able to help me with this code: http://pastebin.com/TXPpxUxU I'm not sure what's wrong, the console says unexpected identifier. Do I have to declare data as a variable or something?
[03:10:06] <dekub> Renari: "<h2 class="blockhead">Preview</h2><div class='blockrow'>"+data+"</div>" just change double quote to single quote "blockhead"
[03:10:15] <incidence> So, what I mean: How can I use 3rd party jQuery plugins within my own?
[03:10:51] <Cork> incidence: just use it, but make sure to load the plugin you depend on BEFORE your own
[03:12:17] <incidence> Cork: Yea, jQuery just doesn't find it. I'm trying to launch colorbox from my own plugin using $.colorbox(settings); =)
[03:12:21] <Renari> Thanks, that fixed the error but it still doesn't seem to be working :\ <div class="preview">is empty after clicking the preview button.
[03:12:53] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Have sorted classes so it starts as col1 now, same problem on both the row and the cols it's offset by 1… :/
[03:13:30] <beancurd> Renari: put a bunch of alert('message'); at various points of your code to see if everything is executing.
[03:13:31] <iman> hi, how can I add a specific css class to add sub element at the same time, such these <li> which are embedded in an <ul> tag http://dpaste.com/726684/
[03:14:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I think it's because "Choose an option…" is counted as an option, but if it's taking the selected values this shouldn't matter should it?
[03:14:08] <itatitat> Ive a question
[03:14:18] <itatitat> I want to select a field, an input
[03:14:20] <itatitat> inside a form
[03:14:27] <beancurd> aye.
[03:14:44] <itatitat> the problem is that my input is inside a table
[03:14:47] <itatitat> my question is
[03:14:52] <raj> Cork, someone in ##javascript mentioned that there's a flaw with .each() and I ended up disconnecting ...he was saying something about it doing something backwards
[03:14:55] <Xotix> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/6wKc5/3/ how can i make the second div selectable?
[03:15:00] <Xotix> *focusable
[03:15:11] <iman> itatitat, use element's ID to access it
[03:15:24] <itatitat> jummmmm ok
[03:15:32] <iman> itatitat, $('#foo').val();
[03:15:38] <itatitat> yes, I know I know
[03:15:40] <iman> itatitat, var temp = $('#foo').val();
[03:15:50] <itatitat> but my problem is diferent because I have many forms and many inputs
[03:15:54] <itatitat> my question is
[03:16:17] <itatitat> can I select, for example, the inputs of the first form, without to write all the tree between form and my input?
[03:16:27] <itatitat> with something like parent or something like that?
[03:16:31] <beancurd> huh.
[03:16:34] <Turbohao> form:first?
[03:16:47] <Turbohao> $(#form:first)
[03:16:47] <itatitat> yes, that work, but.....and the way between the form and input?
[03:17:05] <itatitat> is bored to repeat the same way all time
[03:17:14] <itatitat> form table tr td input
[03:17:16] <itatitat> ....fuck
[03:17:24] <itatitat> can I jump in anyway?
[03:18:28] <Renari> Hm everything seems to be working fine if I alert(data); it shows the correct output.
[03:18:40] <Renari> which would mean something is wrong with this line: $('#preview').html("<h2 class='blockhead'>Preview</h2><div class='blockrow'>"+data+"</div>");
[03:18:50] <itatitat> I made something like this
[03:18:50] <itatitat> .bigForm:first table tr td :text
[03:19:01] <itatitat> but.......buff....
[03:19:12] <itatitat> im sure I can do this nicer
[03:19:13] <Renari> it doesn't seem to be selecting <div class="preview"></div> and putting the code in it.
[03:19:45] <iman> Renari, $('.ul.li').removeClass("sm"); , is it true ?
[03:19:46] <itatitat> how can I rewrite this selection?
[03:20:56] <itatitat> hello!
[03:21:01] <itatitat> how can I make this nicer?
[03:21:02] <itatitat> .bigForm:first table tr td :text
[03:21:08] <itatitat> this selection is very bored
[03:21:17] <Renari> iman: um pasting that in console returned tnothing I don't see how removing a class that doesn't exist helps
[03:21:59] <iman> Renari, this is for example
[03:22:35] <iman> that class is for example, is that main structure correct ?
[03:24:02] <Renari> um doing $('#preview').removeClass("preview"); didn't remove the class from the div no
[03:24:30] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Row works nicely, cols still is +1, I've removed the +1 and re-set the classes as you said.. :/
[03:27:15] <Xotix> is there a known problem when redirecting the paste by changing the focus to a element which has left: −1000px;?
[03:29:01] <Renari> nvm I fixed it
[03:35:02] <karthibhai> HI
[03:38:47] <jonny> hello can some one help me with a json feed to export some on its content in to a div containter

[03:41:49] <fRAiLtY-> lol a bit blatant
[03:41:52] <aro> is there a way to style the loading message
[03:42:06] <aro> with infinitescroll
[03:43:34] <Renari> *sigh* I don't think my data is getting sent properly but looking up docs says I'm doing it right
[03:43:37] <Renari> http://pastebin.com/4cgQvcY4
[03:43:55] <Renari> the first alert outputs the data I'm trying to send
[03:44:06] <Renari> however the second one which is after it sends outputs nothing
[03:44:27] <fRAiLtY-> Here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing I have a selector script, if you choose options from drop-down 1 and drop-down 2 ONLY it highlights where you are on the table. Drop-down 2 works fine, but  Drop-down 1 seems to be offset by 1 column, why? http://pastie.org/3726137 Drop-down 1 is attribute128 and drop-down 2 is attribute127
[03:46:30] <aro> man i could use some herbal supplements right now
[03:46:35] <aro> too bad there isnt anyone around to help me
[03:47:09] <fRAiLtY-> aro: You're in luck…. :D
[03:48:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i'll have a look
[03:48:55] <fRAiLtY-> I removed all the +1's
[03:49:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: check the selection list
[03:49:19] <Cork> its not in the same order as the pable
[03:49:23] <Cork> *table
[03:49:35] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, that's the issue?
[03:49:41] <Cork> ues
[03:49:43] <Cork> *yes
[03:49:50] <fRAiLtY-> Cool ok
[03:49:55] <Cork> your using position indexes
[03:50:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the col<num> needs to match the index of the list in the select
[03:50:56] <Cork> how you do that is up to you :)
[03:50:57] <fRAiLtY-> So sort the table as per the drop-down and all is well?
[03:51:16] <Cork> or reanange the col<num> yes
[03:51:30] <fRAiLtY-> Ugly no? I'll sort the table
[03:51:44] <Cork> i meant both worjs
[03:51:46] <Cork> works
[03:51:55] <Cork> man i type like shit right now -_-
[03:52:13] <Cork> prob a bit to drowsy from the lunch
[03:54:56] <_ikke_> Hmm, weird, I can't scroll with the arrow keys anymore on api.jquery.com
[03:55:17] <astkfour> has anyone here worked with chrome extensions? i'm having a problem displaying a jquery nav bar from the backgound page
[03:55:28] <_ikke_> oh, one-off issuee
[03:55:30] <_ikke_> issue
[03:56:34] <Cork> astkfour: if i understand what you mean correctly; you can't display anything from the bg page
[03:56:41] <Cork> you need to send message to the front end
[03:59:19] <astkfour> yes basically as long as the extension is enabled it will show this menu. no matter what page the user is on.
[03:59:54] <Cork> your readding it to the current page or how do you overlay it?
[04:01:04] <astkfour> well thats the thing i'm not sure if I am doing it correctly i created background.html in the manifest and this is what is inside the background page http://pastebin.com/NjK7AxXG
[04:01:38] <astkfour> i enable the extension and load a webpage and nothing appears
[04:02:07] <Cork> astkfour: (as far as i know) bg pages is for doing bg work, like loading extra data
[04:02:10] <Cork> its never visible
[04:02:50] <Cork> to comunicate with it you use window.sendMessage
[04:04:01] <Cork> this feels quite a bit off topic for this channel though
[04:04:45] <Cagelin> Hi guys. Can anyone tell me how to trigger a change event after a checkbox checkstate has been set automatically?
[04:05:02] <Cagelin> I need to trigger the event after setting the checked attribute via a script (not user click)
[04:05:10] <Cork> $(elm).change()
[04:05:15] <Cagelin> doesn't work Cork
[04:05:15] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[04:05:27] <Cagelin> No error.
[04:05:33] <Cagelin> Nothing, it simply doesn't trigger the event
[04:05:35] <Cagelin> at all.
[04:05:41] <raj> Cork, you haven't gotten rid of me yet... still trying to get this working :)
[04:05:44] <Cork> Cagelin: caniuse is a bot :)
[04:06:05] <Cagelin> I know, but just to be clear, I've tried about anything. Even a on a global scope it doesn't get triggered :/
[04:06:12] <raj> I'm trying to get instanceof Array to work properly http://jsfiddle.net/FwHbL/32/
[04:06:28] <Cagelin> I set the checkbox checkstate like this: $("input[type='checkbox']", this).attr('checked', 'checked');
[04:06:28] <raj> i think the issue is that I'm returning something, which makes no sense
[04:06:34] <Cagelin> but that doesn't trigger the change event somehow :/
[04:06:36] <Cork> Cagelin: need to see a demo, .trigger or .change() works, i've used it countless times
[04:06:49] <astkfour> oh well i fiugred i was using jquery to make this i would come here
[04:06:52] <raj> but I'm not sure what to do with the queryizedObj for the iteration
[04:06:57] <Cagelin> ohh.. trigger() might help in my case
[04:07:14] <Cork> Cagelin: change() is a shorthand for trigger('change')
[04:07:19] <Cork> its the same thing
[04:07:36] <Cagelin> yeah, didn't thought of triggering the event manually :p
[04:07:41] <Cagelin> that'll work, thanks =]
[04:08:39] <astkfour> Cork would you be interested in getting this working for me? i can pay you via paypal? i've been at this for a few hours now and I am not getting anywhere lol
[04:08:43] <Cork> Cagelin: changing values your self never triggers events
[04:08:55] <Cork> astkfour: sorry no time
[04:08:58] <Cork> <-- at work
[04:09:35] <Cork> break?
[04:09:39] <Cork> bah
[04:09:44] <Cork> raj: where does it break?
[04:09:48] <astkfour> haha ok thanks
[04:15:52] <silverhand> How do I pass the current selector in the following syntax? $('selector').mouseover(custom_function(this_selector)); ?
[04:20:14] <nVee> hey guys. I am using jqueryUI sortable and want to move input boxes from one box to another, and on post, I only want the values posted of the 2nd box. I figured I could set all input boxes to disabled and remove the disabled attribute if it's within the 2nd box, but it still posts all the input box values
[04:20:39] <raj> Cork, it shouldn't be showing [object+Object]
[04:21:00] <raj> it should have run queryizeObj on that
[04:27:20] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/FwHbL/33/
[04:27:35] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/FwHbL/34/ even
[04:28:28] <Cork> remeber though that Array is instance of Object
[04:28:43] <Cork> ?eval [] instanceOf Object
[04:28:47] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[04:28:55] <Cork> ?eval ([]) instanceOf Object
[04:28:56] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[04:29:01] <Cork> -_-
[04:29:25] <Cork> ?eval (([]) instanceOf Object)

[04:40:05] <aJacom> Hi. I'm trying to add a .click() binding, but apparently its already binded by another function, what can I do
[04:52:21] <coachz> hi, anyone know a jquery menu that looks  like application menus, like this?  http://i.imgur.com/xVf4g.png
[04:52:39] <coachz> that one is called Memu but the site appears to have died
[04:53:10] <aJacom> http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/d7kzd/ <- This works great on the fiddle. But doesn't on the website :(
[04:54:22] <Lobosque> is there a way to change the url the user typed without reloading the site?
[04:55:16] <coachz> Lobosque:  maybe      $('a[href=a.html]').attr('href', 'b.html');
[04:57:18] <walidvb> i have an issue, and i don't know yet what my solution should be... it's on smaller resolution screens.. any advice?
[04:57:23] <walidvb> www.plak-records.com
[04:58:22] <walidvb> basically header is fixed, and you scroll horizontally ,but on small resolution screens you also scroll up and down, which is not ok in my case
[04:59:11] <walidvb> any suggestions? i thought of integrating a jScrollbar in the info div, under each release
[04:59:23] <Cork> Lobosque: yes and no, you can to some degree in some browser, but theres limitations
[04:59:50] <Cork> Lobosque: history.replaceState allows you to change the path on the same domain in modern browsers
[04:59:58] <Cork> ?mdc replaceState
[04:59:59] <caniuse> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[05:00:10] <walidvb> but not too keen on using jScrollbar..
[05:01:10] <Lobosque> Cork I just need to change the anchor partn
[05:01:20] <Cork> you mean the hash?
[05:01:35] <Cork> try setting window.location.hash
[05:01:51] <Cork> (haven't tried)
[05:05:08] <itatitat> hi guys
[05:05:10] <itatitat> ive a problem
[05:05:15] <itatitat> I've an option select
[05:05:19] <itatitat> is filled with ajax
[05:05:34] <itatitat> I must see a valor, depending what option I select
[05:06:07] <itatitat> the problem is that when I'm going to change the option selected, in that moment, automaticlly change
[05:06:16] <itatitat> before I select a new option
[05:06:44] <itatitat> with the click in the arrow of the option select change automaticlly the option selected
[05:06:56] <itatitat> maybe is because I mustnt use the even click
[05:06:59] <itatitat> or.....onchange?
[05:07:02] <itatitat> what happen?
[05:07:12] <coachz> Does anyone know of a jquery menu plugin that looks like windows application menus ?
[05:07:57] <Cork> coachz: not sure what look your refering to
[05:08:21] <Cork> coachz: the look would have to depends on a special version
[05:08:25] <coachz> like this  http://i.imgur.com/xVf4g.png
[05:08:49] <Cork> you mean just a toolbar menu?
[05:08:52] <coachz> yeah
[05:09:02] <coachz> um no
[05:09:06] <Cork> i think jquery ui has one in the making
[05:09:13] <coachz> you see  http://i.imgur.com/xVf4g.png
[05:09:23] <Cork> ya?
[05:09:23] <coachz> for picking functions like in an app
[05:09:34] <Cork> ya, a toolbar menu
[05:09:36] <coachz> with that look
[05:09:45] <Cork> the look is just css
[05:09:46] <coachz> i didn't know it was called that
[05:09:48] <coachz> ok
[05:09:57] <Cork> and can't really be dependent on the os
[05:10:28] <Cork> coachz: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[05:10:34] <Cork> http://view.jqueryui.com/menubar/demos/index.html#menubar|default
[05:10:56] <Cork> oh...
[05:11:00] <Cork> looks like its landed :)
[05:11:47] <coachz> yeah that menu doesn't look anything like windows apps menus
[05:11:57] <Cork> sure it does
[05:12:05] <Cork> all you need to do is replace the css
[05:12:31] <Cork> all the plugin dictates is the functionality, not design
[05:12:32] <coachz> sorry, i'm not good enough to do that, i would need to see an example
[05:13:49] <coachz> bit yahoo layoffs today,  bummer :-(
[05:13:49] <ThemNuts> sup guys i'm using jqgrid and i want to add a custom button on the navigation. I got the button and it looks ok but i can't set the onClick event like i have with the Ondoubleclick in the list. What can i do to give it similar functionality? http://pastebin.com/hhE2p56R
[05:29:20] <kraai__> hi, is there a way to NOT send cookies with a $.ajax request?
[05:30:08] <Cork> use a cookieless subdomain
[05:30:27] <timing> kraai__: not that I know of, but isn't there a way to ignore it server side becuase you somehow know it's the request where you want to ignore the ookie?
[05:31:35] <kraai__> i could set an ignore field somewhere but would prefer to just dont sent them
[05:32:01] <aismail_> hi everyone, what's the most ellegant way to monitor additions to dom which match the selector "div .myclass" ?
[05:32:07] <Cork> kraai__: browsers sets the cookie and doesn't have control over that
[05:32:26] <kraai__> Cork: Oke thanx
[05:32:48] <Cork> *and js doesn't
[05:36:01] <Fox`> is there no way around using form tags when submitting a file to an iframe?
[05:36:41] <Cork> you can put the parameters as get variables
[05:36:54] <Cork> url?key=val&key=val
[05:37:06] <Cork> but if you need a post, then no
[05:37:26] <bartmax> you can do get & post at the same time.
[05:38:05] <Cork> uh... you can't do post without a form
[05:38:19] <Cork> if you want it to update a window that is
[05:39:12] <aismail_> for my question: maybe an alternative to jquery livequery exists?
[05:39:30] <aismail_> (it seems to be abandoned, latest release in 2009)
[05:40:27] <Cork> aismail_: make sure you use a plugin that doesn't depend on setInterval though
[05:40:42] <aismail_> I know, but probably on IE that's the only way
[05:40:45] <aismail_> do you have any suggestions?
[05:41:08] <Cork> there is one that basicall builds a wrapper around jquerys dom manipulation
[05:41:09] <aismail_> livequery seems to be doing what live() is actually doing, I need only the event that a new type of element was added
[05:41:14] <Cork> that is the best solution
[05:41:21] <aismail_> which one?
[05:41:38] <Cork> to look for when commands that will change the dom happens
[05:41:49] <Cork> instead of using timers or expensive events
[05:42:28] <aismail_> another way in which I've seen this implemented is by disciplined coding (adding all the HTML through a method and only using that method for it)
[05:42:32] <aismail_> probably quite similar to what you're saying
[05:43:01] <Cork> thats extreamly close ya
[05:43:11] <Cork> and its the least costly way to do it
[05:43:25] <aismail_> but is there a ready-made way to do it?
[05:43:40] <Cork> not build into jquery no
[05:43:40] <aismail_> I just want to prototype the idea for now, we can build it on a full-scale afterwards
[05:43:51] <aismail_> what about the plugins?
[05:44:01] <Cork> i've seen a few mentioned here
[05:44:46] <aismail_> let's say my usecase is counting all the <div/>'s in the current DOM
[05:44:56] <aismail_> and displaying that counter whenever divs are added / removed
[05:49:19] <nFFF> Guys http://jsfiddle.net/ENytV/1/
[05:49:32] <nFFF> Can anyone advise why the last object is return all 9 elements
[05:49:35] <nFFF> instead of one
[05:50:54] <quicksilver> nFFF: because that's what remove does?
[05:51:07] <quicksilver> it returns the things you removed...
[05:51:14] <nFFF> Yea figured that
[05:51:36] <nFFF> perhaps I should ask, is it possible to retrieve the non removed elements
[05:51:44] <nFFF> or do I need a new select0r
[05:52:41] <quicksilver> you can use .end() to go back to previous selections
[05:52:50] <quicksilver> I must admit I prefer just to save things in variables myself.
[05:53:09] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/end/
[05:56:28] <Masko> Guys I want to pick second option of select which way is better $("#mySelect").children().eq(1).attr('selected', 'selected'); or   $("#mySelect").val($("#mySelect").children().eq(1).val());
[05:56:55] <Cryp71c> I have a handful of input elements that I'd like to consolidate some of their code. Essentially, they all use ajax to call methods (each has a different one). The code I'd like to consolidate is like this: http://www.intelliot.com/2008/06/jquery-pause-or-delay-for-live-ajax-search/
[05:57:23] <nFFF> quicksilver, mhow would vars help?
[05:57:31] <nFFF> if return always returns the removed elements
[05:57:34] <Cryp71c> ..hrm, nvm.
[05:57:46] <nFFF> remove*
[05:58:11] <nFFF> I could simply select the remaining elements on the DOM using a selector
[05:58:24] <nFFF> but Im hoping to do it with the original object
[06:01:30] <lc0423593> hey guys  is there a GUI Builder for JQ ?

[06:06:18] <jita> I am using jquery easy tabs and i am getting this error while i load the page Uncaught Error: The specified default tab ('li:first-child') could not be found in the tab set. ?
[06:06:31] <quicksilver> nFFF: (a) I was wrong about contains, it's not a method, you'll have to use .filter().
[06:06:44] <quicksilver> nFFF: (b) what you wrote makes no sense, you can't just chain from remove().
[06:07:02] <quicksilver> the return value of remove() only contains the ones which aren't Refurbished.
[06:09:56] <jita> yet i can access it in debug console
[06:09:57] <jita> $('li:first-child')
[06:10:03] <jita> it gives me the li element
[06:17:39] <Masko> Guys I want to pick second option of select which way is better $("#mySelect").children().eq(1).attr('selected', 'selected'); or   $("#mySelect").val($("#mySelect").children().eq(1).val());
[06:23:04] <quicksilver> Masko: $("#mySelect").prop('selectedIndex',1);

[06:27:43] <nmittal_> Hi guys..i have one canvas on my page and want to make sure that when the browser is resized the canvas is resized too.. how can i do that
[06:34:23] <Putr> hi! I need to lazyload images into a crosell, but i need to write the code that feeds the images to the carousell.
[06:35:16] <TandyUK> nmittal_: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[06:36:24] <avidal_> how can i selected all inputs within a form (inluding text, select, options, buttons)
[06:36:35] <avidal_> select even
[06:38:45] <nmittal_> TandyUK, thats perfect thanks
[06:44:36] <ptrin> Hey, I have a bit of jquery used for accessible "fancy" select dropdowns: https://gist.github.com/2301069 . The issue is that I want to be able to detect up and down cursor key presses but some browsers seem to eat them.
[06:47:08] <nmittal_> how can i make sure that the canvas is filling the whole page when the page is loaded
[06:50:07] <rroelofs> avidal_: $(":input")   http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[06:51:29] <rroelofs> avidal_: altho you might want to do something like $("#formid").filter(":input") for better performance
[06:51:44] <avidal_> thanks
[06:59:05] <rroelofs> nmittal_: why do you need js for this.  does css width:100%; height: 100% not work?
[06:59:57] <nmittal_> rroelofs, nope
[07:01:11] <nmittal_> rroelofs, setting it to 100% just stretches the canvas.. but internal drawing code in the canvas still sees the height and width set in code
[07:02:26] <nmittal_> rroelofs, so for example if I am drawing a circle in code.. and set height width to 100% it looks like an ellipse
[07:02:59] <rroelofs> nmittal_: and your resize event handler can't re-query the canvas size and update those numbers?
[07:03:32] <rroelofs> I think we are going to need a fiddle or demo url to be much help
[07:03:52] <nmittal_> rroelofs, resize event handler works fine when the window is resized.. but not the initial page laod
[07:07:00] <rroelofs> nmittal_: I would expect $("canvas").width() get give you the number you need.
[07:07:49] <nmittal_> rroelofs, is that read only? i mean can i set it ?
[07:08:17] <Fox`> Cork: You can't use the file input with GET (or can you)
[07:08:51] <jita> How can i include empty lines separated by enter in html? Like $('id').html('<h2>h2</h2> %New line using Enter % <p>test</p>') ?
[07:08:53] <SionEngine> Hi
[07:08:58] <jita> it says illegal character

[07:10:51] <SionEngine> some on can help me
[07:10:53] <SionEngine> please :)
[07:13:08] <Xotix> I'm opening an external page with fancybox (iframe) and want to have the width and height sized automatically. How can i do that?
[07:13:57] <halcyon1234> Is there an event or something for an element to detect when it has been shown/hidden? Something like:
[07:14:03] <halcyon1234> $("#elm").live("visibility_changed", function() { console.log('I am now shown/hidden.'); });
[07:14:26] <Xotix> halcyon1234:  live is deprecated use on. I think toggle, but im not sure
[07:15:36] <halcyon1234> I'm using 1.4.3, and the company doesn't have any plans on upgrading soon. (Of course).  I'll look into "toggle". BTW: I have an fancyboxAutosize function, I'll drop it into a jfiddle for you, one moment.
[07:17:37] <halcyon1234> Xotix: I've never been able to get an autowidth function going, but this works (sometimes) for autoheight.
[07:17:38] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/s39v3/
[07:17:53] <Xotix> maybe thers an hide event so you can lsiten on it like .hide(function() {}); but this is probably just for the hide function in jQuery.So you'd need to hide it by using hide(). You can also create your own function/event.
[07:17:54] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: have you tried $('#element:visible') or $('#element').is(:visible) ?
[07:18:42] <PavelloZ> `docs :visible
[07:18:54] <halcyon1234> Pavelloz: I can test if an element is visible, but I want to know when it is hidden. For example, when the element's parent container is shown/hidden, I want the child to do something.
[07:20:16] <Xotix> with a script being on xx.foo.com can i get the height of an element within the iframe which has bb.foo.com loaded? (different domain)
[07:20:57] <THC4k> yo, so im building sort of a show planner for a day from json data. I get a list of these shows for the day, each with a start- and endtime. I render these shows with jquery.tmpl and get a bunch of div.show elements. What I would like to do now is calculate the time difference between two shows and display that as a "pause" block. Is there any neat trick to get my list of shows in pairs so that i can calculate the time difference?
[07:21:56] <Xotix> thanks halcyon1234 i'll take a look at it :)
[07:22:12] <Dark_Wolf> I have this page: http://nickolai.brandonjd.net/web/marc/test.html and when I hover over the boxes with "DQ SUR", the boxes that appear go away after 50ms. As shown in http://nickolai.brandonjd.net/web/marc/js/functions.js they're only supposed to trigger if you mouse out of the box. Can anyone tell me what's going on?
[07:22:54] <halcyon1234> xotix: No problem. I haven't tested it on crossdomain pages yet, so I'm not 100% sure if it'll work for your use case or not.
[07:23:30] <Dark_Wolf> Another issue is that if you move around within the container, it sees it as a mouseout event, which makes no sense
[07:25:32] <Dark_Wolf> Nobody around? :/
[07:29:32] <Flo0815> hi
[07:29:41] <Xotix> I'm having an iframe which loads a page with a fixed element. This element is higher than my iframe, how can i make the element cause a scroll bar?
[07:30:25] <Flo0815> Xotix: insert a dummy with the fixed elemtns height
[07:30:38] <Flo0815> would be one solution
[07:30:49] <Flo0815> and position: absolute
[07:30:51] <Flo0815> hidden
[07:31:00] <Dark_Wolf> Xotix: A scrollbar should appear on the iFrame by default if the page it loads is larger than itself.
[07:31:22] <Xotix> it does for non fixed content
[07:31:27] <Xotix> hmm ok thanks
[07:31:50] <Flo0815> but normally it has to show the scrollbars, like Dark_Wolf said
[07:31:52] <Dark_Wolf> Xotix: are you saying that you still want scrollbars even when the element is smaller?
[07:32:17] <Flo0815> i dont think so, Dark_Wolf
[07:32:23] <Dark_Wolf> Hmm.
[07:32:50] <Xotix> what? as i said, my fixed elements don't cause a scrollbar. The scrollbar just goes to the end of the non fixed stuff
[07:33:02] <Xotix> position: fixed;
[07:33:14] <Dark_Wolf> Oh. That's what you meant.
[07:33:46] <Dark_Wolf> Flo0815's solution would probably be good then
[07:34:02] <Flo0815> or setting the inner height to the height of the fixed element?
[07:34:10] <shoky> Dark_Wolf, you're getting mouseout event triggered when the mouse enters the child divs
[07:34:23] <Dark_Wolf> shoky: why might that be?
[07:35:22] <Dark_Wolf> Shouldn't the child divs be a part of the parent element, and thus the mouse isn't actually exiting the parent?
[07:35:43] <SionEngine> I want into a image, move , zoom and send in PHP , (X, Y, Z)
[07:35:46] <PavelloZ> hm...
[07:35:55] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: http://jsfiddle.net/pavelloz/YrzM3/
[07:36:28] <PavelloZ> ofcourse you can use :visible instead
[07:37:42] <Flo0815> Dark_Wolf: maybe stopPropagation?
[07:38:18] <Flo0815> SionEngine: please ask properly. I don't have a clue whats your problem
[07:39:07] <SionEngine> Flo0815: i want do that : http://1.s3.envato.com/files/18124298/index.html
[07:39:18] <Dark_Wolf> Flo0815: Just tried it, and it doesn't seem to stop the issue
[07:39:24] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: check now, i added another approach in the same fiddle
[07:40:15] <Flo0815> SionEngine: so look at the sourceCode of this site
[07:41:01] <SionEngine> i'm not so stupid
[07:41:07] <Flo0815> didn't meant that
[07:41:08] <SionEngine> you can't take the source code
[07:41:10] <shoky> Dark_Wolf, try mouseleave instead of mouseout
[07:41:10] <SionEngine> :D
[07:41:41] <shoky> ah no
[07:41:45] <SionEngine> it't the first time of my developer life i can't take a sourceCode (except PHP)
[07:41:51] <shoky> hmm
[07:41:52] <shoky> maybe ye
[07:41:52] <Dark_Wolf> shoky: that works! Thanks :D
[07:42:07] <shoky> not sure if that's the correct approach though
[07:42:07] <halcyon1234> Pavelloz: Thanks for the link. Here's somethign a bit closer to what I'm trying to solve. I'm trying to figure out what event to bind to for "what_event_do_i_bind_to"
[07:42:08] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/hU5YV/3/
[07:42:17] <Dark_Wolf> shoky: why not?
[07:42:22] <shoky> not sure ;)
[07:42:39] <shoky> well mostly cause the docs start out saying it's an IE propietary event
[07:42:40] <shoky> :)
[07:43:09] <lost123> hi i have loaded some html using an ajax call through jquery .post
[07:43:37] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: if there will be an ajax content downloaded, then use $.ajax callback function
[07:43:39] <Dark_Wolf> It works for me, so I'm keeping it. As long as jQuery simulates it properly I'm okay with it. Thanks again.
[07:43:40] <PavelloZ> or ajaxcomplete
[07:43:41] <Flo0815> SionEngine: sent u a query
[07:43:45] <lost123> and my js doesn't work on the loaded html, how can i load myjs again so that it fires on newly added html?
[07:43:48] <shoky> np
[07:43:49] <Dark_Wolf> Flo0815: thanks to you as well
[07:43:55] <Flo0815> u got it?
[07:44:02] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[07:44:28] <Flo0815> Dark_Wolf: ?
[07:44:40] <Dark_Wolf> Flo0815: For your suggestions
[07:44:53] <Flo0815> Dark_Wolf: ya, np, but does it work now?
[07:45:04] <SamK1975> hey all, say I have two select statements i.e. var selected1 = find(...) and var selected2 = find(...)
[07:45:04] <halcyon1234> Pavelloz: => lost123 is looking for ajax solution. I'm hunting for an event to bind to when visibility changes. =)
[07:45:09] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: if not, then you just have to make an variable in the toggle callback and do something if the variable is true or not
[07:45:10] <Dark_Wolf> Flo0815: It works with mouseleave as opposed to mouseout
[07:45:14] <Dark_Wolf> So yes
[07:45:28] <SamK1975> is there a way to collate the results into one variable? var allSelected = ?
[07:45:53] <shoky> Dark_Wolf in this case you should probably also use mouseenter instead of mouseover
[07:45:54] <halcyon1234> Pavelloz: Yeah, I might need to do that. Or at least throw a custom event. $(this).toggle(); $(this).find("*").trigger("visibility-changed");
[07:46:07] <Dark_Wolf> shoky: alright, I'll change that
[07:46:14] <shoky> because you're getting more mouseover's still on the child divs
[07:46:35] <lost123> i need to reload the js after the ajax call,how can i do it...i tried loading js in ajax response but it still doest fire
[07:46:58] <Dark_Wolf> I'll be off then, thanks
[07:47:13] <shoky> buhbye
[07:47:32] <lost123> anyone?
[07:47:37] <Xotix> If i have a div with content which is bigger than this div, How can i make a scrollbar to that div?

[07:48:25] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[07:48:32] <halcyon1234> Xotix: You can usually do if (innerDiv.height > outerDiv.height) { outerDiv.css("overflow-y", "scroll"); }
[07:48:36] <DerekPioneer> i'm trying to get animate() to slide my horizontal list out of view, a carousel animation. animate({width: 'toggle' }); looks funny though. http://jsfiddle.net/6EPFh/

[07:51:53] <drakythe> quick question (don't have time to persue, just need to know if possible) can an iframe height be dynamically determined via jquery so as to avoid excess scroll bars?
[07:54:43] <halcyon1234> drakythe: Not easily. I have a bit of code for doing that with a fancybox (fancy iframe), maybe you can adapt it:
[07:54:44] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/s39v3/
[07:55:04] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: damn its easy as hell and i have an braindead :D
[07:55:27] <drakythe> halcyon1234: Thanks :)
[07:55:36] <drakythe> PavelloZ: Care to share how?
[07:56:26] <PavelloZ> cant do it properly, but im close ;)
[07:57:08] <ctk> Long shot... anyone know where I can find the slides from Ben Alman's presentation at jQuery Boston 2011?
[07:57:41] <ThemNuts> i got this error saying var is null when i put if(var == null) it still gives me the error. http://pastebin.com/AiCw4sSQ
[08:00:45] <shoky> what exactly does the error say
[08:01:24] <PavelloZ> halcyon1234: http://jsfiddle.net/pavelloz/hU5YV/4/
[08:01:35] <PavelloZ> drakythe: if interrested ^
[08:01:49] <drakythe> PavelloZ: thanks
[08:02:00] <PavelloZ> i've put variable before click action and it was setting it every time before click
[08:02:15] <PavelloZ> i knew it was easy error, its too late for me :)
[08:02:27] <ThemNuts> shoky: batchid is null
[08:02:51] <shoky> uhm
[08:02:59] <shoky> who's outputting that error
[08:03:25] <ThemNuts> what i want to achieve is that when there is no row selected in jqGrid it gives me an alert, else it shows the next grid
[08:03:51] <ThemNuts> the next grid part works fine but can't get the if(not selected)... else... part working
[08:03:53] <shoky> it'll be much easier if you jsfiddle it
[08:03:55] <shoky> ?demo
[08:04:07] <shoky> derp
[08:04:12] <ThemNuts> can't
[08:04:25] <blenderkid> Hi, I'm using the tabs() function. One tab shall not open it's target in the box below, but start a download... Is it possible to have a tab starting a download? Currently it loads the binary data of the download into the box below..
[08:04:26] <ThemNuts> has to many things. jqGrid, dbdata etc
[08:04:31] <shoky> oh
[08:04:34] <shoky> batchid is null?
[08:04:43] <ThemNuts> yeah meaning there is none selected
[08:04:49] <shoky> and then you're trying to access batchid.val
[08:04:58] <shoky> you're checking if batchid.val is null  , not batchid
[08:05:45] <ThemNuts> wich is what i am looking for to check this val. but :)
[08:05:50] <ThemNuts> got it
[08:05:52] <ThemNuts> thanks
[08:06:08] <shoky> this val ain't no val if batchid is null ;p
[08:07:05] <lduros> I have an element and I want to take everything inside of it (but not the element itself) and place it somewhere else. Using clone() takes elem.clone().appendTo('#mydiv'); takes the element too, while I only want the inside of it? How can I do it?
[08:08:27] <shoky> maybe .unwrap() ?
[08:08:33] <shoky> never used it myself though.
[08:09:15] <devkinetic> i have a slider with next/prev links. How can i disable the button until its code is completed (ajax request/animation). For example, a user clicks next 5 times moving the count up 5 on my slider, but the animation only grabs up to 3 because of the delay.
[08:09:24] <devkinetic> here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/wjGYW/1/
[08:09:47] <freeed> Iduros, try elem.html().clone.appentTo('#myDiv')
[08:10:03] <freeed> *appendTo
[08:10:23] <shoky> aye that seems much better than unwrapping
[08:11:10] <lduros> freeed: clone without ()?
[08:11:37] <freeed> devkinetic, i did something similar by setting the next/prev buttons to disabled by default, after the first image is loaded set the next link to enabled, once the animation starts set the button back to disabled and so on
[08:11:48] <freeed> idorus, sorry typo - yep .clone()
[08:11:54] <lduros> freeed: ok :-)
[08:12:12] <shoky> actually would that work..
[08:12:24] <shoky> .html() is a string
[08:12:33] <devkinetic> freeed: that sounds up my ally, how did you do that?
[08:13:55] <shoky> lduros, i think maybe: elem.contents().clone().appendTo(..)
[08:14:00] <freeed> devkinetic, by 'enabled' and 'disabled' I simply had two css classes and swapped them with jquery. On page load I set the two elemens with addClass('disabled'), after the first image has loaded simply set .removeClass('disabled').addClass('enabled') once the animation starts you would do the opposite to disabled the next button (this way the user can only advance one at a time
[08:14:14] <lduros> shoky: hmm
[08:14:29] <shoky> or did it work with .html() ?
[08:14:40] <shoky> cause that'd surprise me
[08:15:10] <freeed> Iduros, you dont even need clone.. $('#newParent').html($('oldParent').html())
[08:15:18] <lost123>  i have loaded some html using an ajax call through jquery .post and my js doesn't work on the newly added html
[08:15:20] <devkinetic> freeed: what was the css you used for those classes then to disable the click event from firing?
[08:15:22] <interopcop> question about selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/jdC7G/3/ '#errorExplanation ul li' is a bad way to find this specific error since there may be others in the ul.  how can I select "there exists an li in #errorExplanation ul which has this text"?
[08:15:43] <shoky> yah but .html() wont copy jquery-specific data
[08:15:44] <shoky> i think
[08:15:56] <shoky> like .data() stuff for example
[08:16:20] <shoky> if only Eviltwin were here... . ... . . ..
[08:16:22] <lost123> how can i reload js so it works after the loaded html?
[08:16:22] <starsinmypockets> I'd like to write a simple modal for some forms (loaded via ajax)... anyone point me at some code or in the right direction (I don't realy want to implement jquery ui or a library jsut implement something light)
[08:16:55] <freeed> devkinetic, I think I may have used a helper function to unbind the click event on the buttons.. dont quite remember.. you may also be able to just set attr('disabled', 'disabled') not sure if that applies to all elements
[08:18:50] <freeed> lost123, if you have some jquery like $(elem).click(… which is not working on the new elements, simply change the click function to use .live(), ie $(elem).live('click', function() { … }) and it will be bound to all new elements as well that match the query
[08:21:26] <danzik17> shoky: .clone( true ) will copy data and events.  clone( true, true ) will do it for all children as well - see ?clone
[08:23:51] <halcyon1234> wass afk for a bit. Pavelloz: thanks.
[08:24:55] <LordThumper> Hi. Is there a way to postpone an event handler?
[08:24:57] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/cWXs6/
[08:25:23] <LordThumper> In this demo, is there any way to postpone "#bar" on click event handler to after the div's text is changed?
[08:26:33] <devkinetic> freeed: i tried adding $(this).unbind('click'); to my click event function. The in my animation's complete function i called $("#next").bind('click'); but that isn't working
[08:26:43] <danzik17> LordThumper: just don't use the href like that.  call hello in the click handler, and prevent default in the click handler if you want.
[08:26:46] <mikkelb> I'm trying to switch from using the jQuery Cycle plugin to using a pure jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/2Ey2s/
[08:26:49] <mikkelb> Should I just start removing the stuff I don't need from http://malsup.github.com/jquery.cycle.all.js or would I be better off starting on something fresh? I mean, am I right in my assessment that jQuery Cycle is perhaps a little more complex than it has to be?
[08:26:56] <mikkelb> * to using pure jQuery
[08:27:34] <freeed> devkinetic, well you would need to respecify the click function, elem.click(function(){ … })
[08:27:43] <LordThumper> danzik17: I made the demo just to demonstrate my issue
[08:27:51] <LordThumper> I know it can be restructed to function as I want
[08:27:56] <lost123> freeed: .live doesn't work too
[08:28:08] <freeed> mikkelb, try the lite version of cycle
[08:28:09] <lost123> the js functions stll don't fire on new html elements
[08:28:18] <freeed> lost123, post your code - www.pastie.net
[08:28:20] <LordThumper> restructered*
[08:28:23] <mikkelb> freeed: No thanks
[08:28:46] <LordThumper> I was thinking if I could use the jQuery deferred for my issue
[08:28:50] <LordThumper> If that even makes sense
[08:29:18] <danzik17> LordThumper: this is needlessly convuluted imo, but http://jsfiddle.net/cWXs6/1/
[08:29:23] <danzik17> convoluted*
[08:30:04] <devkinetic> freeed: your saying i need to copy/paste everything from my initial click function again into a redefined one? I can't just enable it again and have it contunie to fire off, disable, finish, enable?
[08:30:29] <lost123> http://www.pastie.org/3727556 freeed
[08:31:05] <LordThumper> danzik17: That works, thanks :)
[08:31:06] <freeed> devkinetic, you would need to put the contents of your click function into it's own function and call that again - once you unbind('click') that function no longer exists
[08:32:33] <mikkelb> Anybody wanna earn a quick $35 bucks to simplify http://malsup.github.com/jquery.cycle.all.js for me?
[08:32:34] <lost123> freeed:  i am using .html instead of .data in success callback
[08:33:07] <freeed> lost123, can you include some sample data of what is being returned - only seeing the js doesn't show enough. Also - indent your code properly so it's ledgible :)
[08:35:38] <lost123_> i was disconnected sorry
[08:35:49] <lost123_> freeed: did you look at the paste
[08:36:05] <freeed> lost123_, can you include some sample data of what is being returned - only seeing the js doesn't show enough. Also - indent your code properly so it's ledgible :)
[08:37:30] <shoky> danzik17, i know, thanks
[08:37:49] <lost123_> freeed: i am getting slideshow html with divs set to display:none, the js was supposed tochange it to display: block one after the other. That js isn'tworking
[08:38:06] <lost123_> on the old html it works, but when new posts are loaded with ajax it doesn't
[08:39:29] <freeed> lost123_ the .live() function would replace your $('#posts').click() or similar - not sure without seeing more of your code / samples of the returned data with comments as what you're trying to do.
[08:40:49] <lost123_> i have it on my local host, its a lot of data
[08:40:57] <lost123_> the js file is too big
[08:41:27] <jes> I have a cool $("#log").hide(3000); animation when I click a checkbox. How do I make it restart if I press the checkbox again?
[08:45:47] <acxty> Hi guys, I want to make a resizable div but at the same time resize the layers that have boundary with it. I try also resize but have no effect, is it possible to do that?
[08:58:11] <jscheel> Hey guys, I think I've found a bug with jQuery drag and drop and the chrome dev channel. Problem is, I can't seem to figure out where the blame lies :)
[08:58:26] <jscheel> so
[08:58:33] <jscheel> here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pXhsr/6/
[08:58:51] <jscheel> basic gist is removing an iframe when dragging starts
[08:59:03] <jscheel> it works in chrome stable, safari, etc
[08:59:19] <jscheel> but in the chrome dev channel, the dragging stops until I let go of my mouse
[08:59:20] <jscheel> '
[08:59:27] <nebiros> hi, there's some equivalent to prototype's curry function? actually I already using $.proxy method but can't add arguments to the function created
[09:00:50] <jscheel> if I use native html5 dragging, everything is fine: http://jsfiddle.net/nVYXB/1/
[09:01:02] <youngin> Eviltwin1: hello
[09:01:10] <jscheel> so I'm guessing there is something not meshing between jquery ui's mouse capture and chrome dev
[09:01:21] <markq> jscheel: it works for me
[09:01:29] <markq> I'm on the latest chrome dev
[09:02:22] <jscheel> markq: me too. On http://jsfiddle.net/pXhsr/6/, does the drag not stop as soon as the iframe is removed?
[09:02:36] <jscheel> markq: what os are you on?
[09:03:23] <markq> when I click and start dragging the iframe is removed and I can keep dragging it till I let go of the mouse
[09:03:29] <markq> Win 7 x64
[09:04:56] <jscheel> markq: interesting, I wonder if it's an osx issue
[09:05:04] <jscheel> markq: thanks for looking at it!
[09:05:30] <markq> seems strange though. I hope it gets figured out! np
[09:06:59] <jscheel> markq: yeah, I'm on the fence about worrying over it. What ever issue might be taken care of by the time it makes it to stable
[09:16:18] <bsilwal> I am novice. I need a jQuery that works in Firebug and will change the position and value to a jQuery slider. Any body please help.
[09:17:39] <tesmar> hmm.. looks like jquery changed when using something like $(.myclass, my context)
[09:17:57] <gigamonkey> In the jquery-ui css the .ui-button has "overflow: hidden;" followed by "*overflow: visible". My css validator is choking on the "*overflow". Is that a bug or some CSS construct I'm not aware of?
[09:18:01] <tesmar> if .myclass_ is hidden in the context, older versions of jQ would pick it up, newer ones do not
[09:18:02] <Brodingo_> tesmar selectors should be strings
[09:18:17] <tesmar> it is in my code
[09:18:23] <tesmar> I just typed quickly here
[09:18:33] <Brodingo_> gigamonkey star hack in css is forrrrrie6 or ie7 i think
[09:19:16] <Brodingo_> ?p @ tesmar
[09:19:25] <Brodingo_> ahem
[09:19:34] <tesmar> @Brodingo_
[09:19:39] <Brodingo_> stupid bot
[09:19:54] <tesmar> $('[rel="3"]', oAddNewRowForm)
[09:20:11] <tesmar> if the rel=3 is hidden in the context, query will not find it
[09:20:19] <tesmar> 1.7, but older versions will
[09:20:45] <Brodingo_> ?p @ tesmar
[09:20:46] <bot-t> tesmar, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:21:30] <gigamonkey> Brodingo_:  thanks. As always it's tough to Google things about punctuation. ;-)
[09:22:02] <Brodingo_> yw heh yeah i can imagine
[09:24:04] <devkinetic> freeed: thank you for your assistance before, i moved my click stuff into another function and used bind/unbind to achieve functionality
[09:37:29] <adisbladis> I have a problem with loading a simple jquery plugin that looks like this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/576092/, the page code looks like this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/576093/
[09:38:40] <adisbladis> The JS works fine when I put it in a single line and put it in the firebug console but not when included from the html
[09:40:38] <rroelofs> adisbladis: so you can't do $.sampleplugin() ?
[09:42:24] <rroelofs> and does your sampleplugin script show up in the list of loaded scripts?
[09:43:49] <adisbladis> rroelofs: $.sampleplugin() returns undefined
[09:44:39] <adisbladis> rroelofs: How do I check loaded scripts?
[09:45:57] <Induane> I have two pages - a main page that loads various simple subpages in a side pane.   It looks like this: http://imagebin.org/206628      The page itself can be loaded on its own and looks like this: http://imagebin.org/206629
[09:46:25] <Induane> The issue that I have is that there is a button that loads a dialog - this button exists in the little basic page that is loaded by the main page using .load
[09:46:40] <Induane> and when I click the icon in the main page, the dialog doesn't display
[09:46:51] <Induane> however if I load the page on its own it displays fine
[09:46:57] <Induane> as such: http://imagebin.org/206630
[09:47:09] <solidus-river> how would i focus an element and slide the page to show the element?
[09:47:13] <solidus-river> er, scroll the page
[09:47:19] <Induane> http://dpaste.com/726823/ is the main page code
[09:47:35] <Induane> http://dpaste.com/726649/ is the code for the 2nd page
[09:49:17] <adisbladis> Found out how to check it, yes, the script is loaded
[09:49:23] <mikkelb> Is there something similar to hoverIntent (i.e. which accounts for accidental off-hovers)?
[09:50:40] <Induane> so is there a way to launch a dialog from a page that is loaded as an aajax page?
[09:56:56] <markq> how do I create an ajax loader while the content is being fetched?
[09:57:05] <markq> to point to a gif
[10:01:47] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to find a lightbox plugin that will load a specific page into the lightbox, anyone know any good ones off the top of their head?
[10:02:02] <Brodingo_> ?colorbox @ GoGoGarrett
[10:02:02] <bot-t> GoGoGarrett, ColorBox (plugin) - A light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.3 & 1.4 http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[10:02:32] <GoGoGarrett> I see outside html
[10:02:47] <GoGoGarrett> but I'm looking to do "inside" html. pages within my application but in a lightbox, hm
[10:03:19] <mikkelb> Is there another way of achieving what hoverIntent does by just using jQuery's hover? http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html (i.e. without having to depend on a large messy 3rd party library)
[10:03:39] <Brodingo_> GoGoGarrett see the href and inline options
[10:04:27] <rroelofs> adisbladis: sorry, had to do real work for a min.  if you type $.fn into the console what do you see?
[10:04:33] <GoGoGarrett> Brodingo_:  thanks, i'll look into it
[10:05:38] <rroelofs> adisbladis: you should see an object with all the usual jquery methods + any added plugins
[10:06:54] <Brodingo_> mikkelb you really think hoverintent is large and messy?
[10:12:48] <GoGoGarrett> Brodingo_: http://jsfiddle.net/4x8wx/ I can't seem to get this working correctly <- these links are going to be dynamic and with a conditional i'm going to apply a class that I want to then be displayed in a light box that is the href of that specific link
[10:12:52] <mikkelb> Brodingo_: well hehe
[10:13:36] <mikkelb> actually you're right it is pretty nice and tight
[10:13:57] <Induane> sorry crashed
[10:14:10] <Brodingo_> GoGoGarrett you should be wrapping $(this) in an anon func
[10:14:23] <Induane> Did I miss anything regarding the question I asked? (sorry, dc hit me)
[10:14:39] <Brodingo_> mikkelb yeah i recommend it
[10:15:04] <GoGoGarrett> The whole thing, or just that specific "href" value
[10:15:13] <mikkelb> Brodingo_: its just that im trying to get rid of all my other scripts
[10:15:25] <mikkelb> coming up with stuff that is nicer and simpler
[10:15:39] <mikkelb> figured id throw hoverintent into that bunch without really looking at it - my bad, im sorry
[10:15:48] <Brodingo_> GoGoGarrett just the value in the options
[10:16:06] <GoGoGarrett> href: $(function(){ $(this) }),
[10:17:22] <Brodingo_> GoGoGarrett if youre trying to make an ajax call you dont use inline, thought you meant elements on the page already
[10:17:43] <GoGoGarrett> ah sorry, I'm actually trying to load pages already in the applicaiton, but not currently in the dom
[10:17:54] <GoGoGarrett> so I'm assuming ajax will be the best way, i'll try that
[10:18:03] <Brodingo_> right go for it
[10:20:56] <GoGoGarrett> Got it working, thanks a lot
[10:21:07] <Brodingo_> cheers
[10:24:35] <context> so... (using older jquery) i have a live() and when i actually click it works... but if i do trigger('click') in code... it doesnt catch it. anyone know why?
[10:25:50] <Brodingo_> ?p @ context
[10:25:51] <bot-t> context, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:26:36] <context> this again :/
[10:27:33] <Brodingo_> well
[10:27:49] <Brodingo_> context it could be any number of things, how else do you expect people to help?
[10:29:18] <neersighted> I'm having trouble with some .toggle() effects here: http://tmp.neersighted.com/cloudev/
[10:29:28] <neersighted> please read the source, then click the widget buttons
[10:29:51] <neersighted> when I click the 'libirc' button, it loads the 'libirc' widget
[10:30:04] <neersighted> but more often than not, it does not hide the 'libirc' button
[10:30:28] <stalecache> yea, since live() is attaching an click event handler to the document and not the element (relying on event bubbling)... doesn't $(el).trigger("click") fire on the element and hopefully bubble up to the document?
[10:31:07] <context> stalecache: thats what i thought
[10:31:48] <context> brodingo_: and this is a little harder to jsfiddle. its doing an ajax request which is putting these checkboxes in the dom, then checking them
[10:31:59] <context> hel if i do trigger() in the console it doesnt work either
[10:32:14] <context> jsfiddle really sucks at indenting js
[10:32:46] <stalecache> context, i could never figure out how to trigger live events, so i'd take the code out of the handler and put it into a function... then instead of trigger, i would just call the function
[10:33:24] <Brodingo_> probably a good idea
[10:33:54] <context> ok... correction my live() IS being called
[10:34:01] <context> its not doing what its suppose to be doing :/
[10:34:59] <bricker88> Can anybody see why the first animation works, but the second doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/ I can see that class is changing properly in the callback for the first one, but the second function is never called.
[10:35:32] <k1t> hey folks, quick q: i change my LI by adding/removing a CSS upon clicking, everything fine with that except when I add an element dynamically the selector doesn't seem to pick up new LI elements
[10:35:42] <context> ok so...
[10:35:45] <k1t> any idea on how to 'reset' the selector, something along those lines?
[10:36:06] <context> trigger('click') on a checkbox apparently sets the ":checked" attribute AFTER running event handlers
[10:36:34] <context> that makes a LOT of sense. lets make trigger() work the exact opposite of the real-world
[10:38:21] <Brodingo_> k1t you need to either be using event delegation or have callbacks binding functionality to newly added elements
[10:38:35] <ravenzz> ?on @ k1t
[10:38:35] <bot-t> k1t, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:38:39] <k1t> Brodingo_: is there a reference/
[10:38:46] <k1t> ravenzz: ah gotcha
[10:38:52] <k1t> ravenzz: Brodingo_ ty
[10:39:10] <k1t> that shall do the trick
[10:40:06] <context> and prop() doesnt call any even trigger
[10:40:25] <context> so i get to do prop() THEN trigger some event without actually changing its checkbox? wtf !@#
[10:41:39] <stalecache> context, i'd say stop triggering events and just write your code differently
[10:41:50] <k1t> ravenzz: and Brodingo_ i googled it and noticed live() that seems to work as well
[10:42:01] <Brodingo_> live is older, on is prefered
[10:42:04] <context> stalecache: id rather know why jquery doesn't work
[10:42:05] <k1t> ah
[10:42:17] <k1t> Brodingo_: ok I will switch it
[10:42:27] <context> id rather know why trigger() in fact does not work
[10:43:15] <PavelloZ|home> context, +1, tried to trigger click lately - no positive results
[10:43:15] <context> id rather know why specifically something as simple as trigger('click') in fact does not work the same as me clicking my mouse
[10:43:21] <bricker88> Normally I wouldn't repost like this, but since everybody's talking about it, my "on" handler doesn't seem to be working properly: The first one is fine, the second one does nothing. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/ (click the arrow once, it animates fine. Click it again, the second one never gets called)
[10:43:22] <PavelloZ|home> i tried on <select>
[10:44:10] <k1t> Brodingo_: sweet, on() works well and was a quick one
[10:44:15] <k1t> thx guys
[10:44:17] <Brodingo_> cheers
[10:44:30] <context> and i canNOT do prop('checked', true); trigger('click') cause well.... then the handlers get 'it is checked' then the trigger unchecks it.
[10:45:08] <context> how am i possible the first person to ever have this problem
[10:45:48] <andrew9183> bricker88: race conditions
[10:46:11] <andrew9183> bricker88: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/2/
[10:46:52] <ajpiano> context: the problem is the organisation of your code
[10:47:04] <ajpiano> context: what you should do is not be triggering clicks on things to trigger their anonymous handlers
[10:47:12] <ajpiano> you should just name the function, and then bind it or call it directly
[10:47:56] <bricker88> andrew9183: I see how you solved the problem, but can you explain why it is that it has to be this way?
[10:48:02] <bricker88> (thank you by the way)
[10:48:43] <bricker88> andrew9183: it also seems that after the first cycle of animations, it's broken, immediately calling the callback function after clicking the arrow again
[10:49:26] <context> ajpiano: so.. i should never expect "click" or "change" or ANY event for that matter to mean the same thing as doing it in real life. and instead of letting an evented model manage my dom, i should ensure i update all my code when i change a function or add some function and make sure i call it from the 20 places its needed
[10:49:34] <context> wtf is the point of events if they arent gonna work?
[10:49:55] <context> should i expect jquery to actually do ANYTHING that the docs say ?
[10:49:59] <context> cause right now you are saying no.
[10:50:00] <ajpiano> be more melodramatic
[10:50:03] <ajpiano> please
[10:50:12] <ajpiano> i randomly stopped in here to give you some advice
[10:50:22] <bricker88> andrew9183: I got it working properly with this: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/3/ But I am a little embarrassed by that solution, I'm sure there is a better way to do it.
[10:50:28] <ajpiano> make of it what you will
[10:50:32] <JillesCode> Guys, I have several images, with different heights and widths, and I want them all to be c.a 200px - 200px (even though some are 400px - 700px, what facebook does when you look at photo's) how would I do this?
[10:50:39] <context> ajpiano: i do appreciate it. its just nerve racking that half the time crap dont actually work how you'd expect it to
[10:51:06] <JillesCode> Thumbnails
[10:51:17] <ajpiano> context: triggered events don't work the same way as actual native events frequently
[10:51:28] <ajpiano> context: but the point is more conceptual than that
[10:51:28] <bricker88> JillesCode: You can solve that with just CSS, put a div around the image and set a max width and height, then overflow: hidden
[10:51:48] <JillesCode> bricker88: That's actually a genius idea, I'm retarded
[10:52:10] <ajpiano> context: if you want to be able to doSomething(), then you have a function that does it, and then when an event happens, you respond to it by adding an event listener
[10:52:29] <PavelloZ|home> JillesCode, ye, and then you can put the images into background-image and by positioning, you can center them (try percents)
[10:52:43] <ajpiano> you don't force the thing to happen
[10:52:55] <ajpiano> to get your desired effect as a consequence instead of just doing it
[10:55:17] <ajpiano> anyhow, i gotta roll, best of luck
[10:58:51] <JillesCode> bricker88: i've done this, but it shows the upper left corner of my image, not the center..
[10:59:13] <chasemb> Anyone got a second to help me out?
[10:59:13] <chasemb> http://pastebin.com/4WQcX2mn
[10:59:30] <PavelloZ|home> JillesCode, try going the way i suggested
[11:00:02] <JillesCode> PavelloZ|home: I also tried that, but doesn't seem to work!
[11:00:09] <bricker88> JillesCode: You can either use PavelloZ's solution, or on the image you can set position: absolute; left: −50%; top: −50%; (or something like that)
[11:00:12] <PavelloZ|home> so you are doing it wrong :)
[11:00:19] <chasemb> I'm trying to display something based on two select options
[11:00:28] <chasemb> using the jquery change function
[11:01:16] <Induane> in jquery I have a page loaded with a simple .load(url) such that it is displayed in a small part of my parent page
[11:01:30] <Induane> I cannot get any dialogs to display from this loaded url
[11:01:37] <Induane> http://dpaste.com/726857/  is the html
[11:01:47] <Induane> http://dpaste.com/726859/ is the little page it loads
[11:02:20] <Induane> it is catching the submit - I know this because the console output shows the logged stuff
[11:02:31] <Hooloovoo> Induane: o/
[11:02:39] <Induane> and if I remove the e.preventDefault(); the form submits
[11:02:42] <Induane> Hooloovoo: !!
[11:02:43] <Induane> ,3
[11:02:45] <Induane> <3 *
[11:02:48] <Hooloovoo> Induane: i'm guessing you haven't fixed it? =D
[11:02:59] <Induane> hah no
[11:02:59] <MindSpark> hi, I am loading a page using ajax. I want to replace the entire html. I am not even sure if that's doable. But the problem is how do I make the browser re-parse the head, i.e. reload css and js?
[11:02:59] <andrew9183> bricker88: i believe .on() doesn't bind to future events
[11:03:02] <andrew9183> you have to use delegate
[11:03:02] <rns> anyone here using highcharts?
[11:03:22] <bricker88> andrew9183: I see, thank you
[11:03:35] <Induane> Hooloovoo: it is befuddling
[11:03:47] <Hooloovoo> Induane: go back to the other channel and i'll help you. it's so crowded here =P
[11:03:52] <Induane> it is simply the dialog that won't display
[11:04:07] <andrew9183> bricker88: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/4/
[11:04:10] <ajpiano> bricker88: andrew9183 it's not true that .on() doesn't bind to future events
[11:04:31] <ajpiano> you just have to use it with $("#container").on("click", "selector", fn)
[11:04:35] <Eviltwin1> It is true that .on() doesn't bind to future elements
[11:04:39] <Eviltwin1> directly
[11:04:42] <Eviltwin1> But it does indirectly
[11:04:48] <Eviltwin1> Through the event delegation syntax
[11:04:50] <ajpiano> i hate the idea of "binding to future events"
[11:04:53] <Eviltwin1> Yeah
[11:05:02] <ajpiano> either way, that's not what it does, it just is event delegation
[11:05:12] <ajpiano> i want to like dispel that phrase from the world
[11:05:25] <PavelloZ|home> it is more like binding to element which is not in the dom at the moment of the event took place, yep?
[11:05:27] <ajpiano> *regular* bind binds to future events
[11:05:31] <ajpiano> it doesn't bind to ones in the past
[11:05:34] <ajpiano> lol
[11:05:35] <Eviltwin1> I should go back to writing my article about "Why I think .live() should .die()"
[11:05:41] <andrew9183> lol
[11:06:54] <bricker88> Eviltwin1: Wasn't the purpose of .on() to consolidate all the different bind(), live(), delegate(), etc?
[11:06:56] <JillesCode> PavelloZ|home: bricker88 http://jillescode.com/show.html there, you see the image below? well, I need that to be better sized into the box, but how!
[11:07:12] <andrew9183> ah okay, bricker88: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/5/
[11:07:21] <andrew9183> thanks ajpiano/eviltwin for the clarification
[11:08:01] <bricker88> andrew9183: Great, that is much more elegant than my other working solution. Thank you
[11:08:31] <diffmans> does ':' have significance in jquery selectors. Is "div#id" different from "div:#id
[11:08:38] <Eviltwin1> Yes
[11:08:41] <Eviltwin1> Yes it does
[11:08:49] <andrew9183> isn't : for pseudo selectors
[11:08:53] <Eviltwin1> (Almost) all characters do
[11:09:10] <diffmans> what's the diff between those two?
[11:09:11] <bricker88> andrew9183: Actually… after all that I found that this is even more elegant: http://jsfiddle.net/P8BFA/6/
[11:09:21] <Eviltwin1> The second doesn't work as far as I know
[11:09:22] <bricker88> andrew9183: But at least we learned something!
[11:09:36] <andrew9183> bricker88: yeah, awesome :)
[11:09:46] <diffmans> it works, that's why I was wondering
[11:09:58] <diffmans> I guess it just ignores the ':'
[11:10:04] <melle> Hi all, does anyone know how to add live events to SVG elements? I can't seem to get it to work with a simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/WWDcQ/
[11:10:51] <Eviltwin1> Then perhaps it's being interpreted as an empty pseudo selector or something
[11:10:58] <Eviltwin1> A filter that doesn't remove anything
[11:10:59] <Eviltwin1> Either way
[11:11:18] <Eviltwin1> Don't count on it working
[11:12:29] <diffmans> thnx eviltwin
[11:12:39] <Eviltwin> melle: That's not the syntax for it
[11:13:10] <Eviltwin> melle: How to do "live" events with .on is documented under the heading of "Event Delegation" on see ?on and should also be described on ?live
[11:13:11] <bot-t> melle, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:13:14] <StubbornTurtle> How can I give a parameter to a widget method… like $('#example').exampleWidget('method','method parameter'); ?
[11:13:26] <Eviltwin> Because .live is now deprecated but the functionality isn't
[11:13:50] <Eviltwin> StubbornTurtle: That should work just fine
[11:15:51] <StubbornTurtle> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:16:04] <StubbornTurtle> Eviltwin: found the problem. Was with my selector. doh.
[11:20:06] <melle> Eviltwin: Thx for the help, $('#img').on('click', 'text', function() {  }); works fine
[11:40:21] <beekir> Just wanting to vent:  Javascript has a F***ING RETARDED "feature" when you try to use multi-line expressions in combination with "return".  Don't get burnt by return!  (Better yet:  Don't produce idiotic "features" into your language that quit parsing an expression before it hitting a semicolon for end of statement!!!)
[11:40:49] <beekir> return (newline) expression && (newline) expression && (newline) expression ==  return undefined;
[11:41:09] <beekir> i just lost 8 hours of my life to this
[11:41:21] <beekir> and wasted 2 more hours of a co-worker's life
[11:41:43] <gnarf> beekir: return ( safe && \n works fine );
[11:42:49] <markkes> Guys, what books would you remember if you want too get the know and learn jQuery
[11:42:52] <beekir> gnarf:  we were sooooo confused when wrapping the expression in parens appeared to fix it ;)  "what the hell did we just change?  why does tha tmatter?"
[11:43:19] <beekir> markkes:  lots and lots of practice + a one-page jquery cheat sheet ;)
[11:43:51] <gnarf> ?learn
[11:43:51] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:44:24] <sonuloveu> WebDragon, Iam here too :D
[11:44:27] <beekir> markkes:  That Mozilla link the bot just dropped is *awesome* -- developer.mozilla.org in general
[11:44:34] <WebDragon> sonuloveu: cool, that was easy
[11:44:41] <WebDragon> glad I could help
[11:44:41] <gnarf> markkes: jqfundamentals is pretty good too
[11:44:42] <WebDragon> ;D

[11:45:21] <sonuloveu> this is in IE console
[11:45:30] <blindMoe> try using the unpacked version
[11:45:55] <WebDragon> yeah what blindmoe said -- that's always a good start when the plugin itself is erroring

[11:47:10] <sonuloveu> uncaught exception: Prototype-UI library require Prototype library >= 1.6.0
[11:47:15] <sonuloveu> what does in need?
[11:47:25] <WebDragon> http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8533738 <-- currently "meddling" thanks to you guys
[11:47:28] <beekir> sonuloveu:  perhaps prototype library > 1.6.0 ?
[11:47:39] <andrew9183> anyone know off their top of the head of why binding to window.resize in FF is n ot working ?
[11:48:01] <WebDragon> sonuloveu: possibly that jquery script isn't set up to run in noConflict() ?
[11:48:43] <WebDragon> so it's interfering with both, itself, and the other scriptaculous stuff as well? I know magento uses a crapton of prototype (really REALLY wish they'd switch to jquery and refactor all that junk)
[11:48:47] <sonuloveu> so I might need to add noColflict somewhere?
[11:48:55] <WebDragon> it's a fair guess
[11:49:02] <sonuloveu> gotcha
[11:49:17] <WebDragon> had to do similar things for my scripting work on www.thinkaesthetica.com
[11:49:54] <sonuloveu> I see
[11:50:37] <beekir> WebDragon:  I'm so glad this isn't a page like lemon party LOL.  Or perhaps it is:  I can't get to your site.

[11:51:49] <beekir> i'm dig'ing at it now
[11:52:10] <WebDragon> its offline on downforeveryoneorjustme.com too
[11:52:50] <beekir> this is kinda weird.  I get a DNS answer "SERVFAIL" for thinkaesthetica.com
[11:52:55] <beekir> but not for any other non-existant domains
[11:53:50] <beekir> so i'm thinking you've got some goofy shit going on in your DNS...
[11:54:12] <WebDragon> or the hosting co is having some sort of outage

[11:55:46] <astkfour> nothing happens when i select an option
[11:56:05] <astkfour> any ideas
[11:56:15] <NoiseEee> astkfour: recreate on a jsfiddle
[11:57:01] <astkfour> ok
[11:57:23] <New0> hi every one. how can i create dynamic talbe using DOM?
[11:57:48] <NoiseEee> New0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.createElement and appending things
[11:58:43] <NoiseEee> New0: sorry thought i was in ##javascript
[11:58:57] <astkfour> lol it works on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/zebCL/ but not on my site thats odd
[11:59:19] <NoiseEee> New0: but same idea, really, but jquery you can do quick. var newTableElement = $('<table id="something">')
[11:59:29] <NoiseEee> astkfour: check your console, etc
[11:59:54] <NoiseEee> astkfour: and http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[12:00:29] <New0> NoiseEee, well the problem that i having is also how to build it. but for now i just want to know to create it or modify it. it for a flash MP3 palyer
[12:00:35] <New0> *player
[12:01:33] <astkfour> i did nothing shows up in the log
[12:01:37] <astkfour> *console
[12:02:21] <WebDragon> dang, beekir left.I wanted to thank him for the heads-up on the DNS being out
[12:02:26] <WebDragon> found the problem
[12:03:07] <New0> NoiseEee, the link u gave me before https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript what was the actual purpose of it, if i may ask
[12:04:38] <NoiseEee> to (re)introduce you to JS fundamentals

[12:05:47] <New0> NoiseEee, got ya. thanks for this i will try to find the time to learn if ;) (right now i'm in some course got i lot to learn on WebMaster) but tnx
[12:06:26] <hampsterblade> guh, I hate parsing xml documents.  I'm ready to rip my hair out
[12:07:43] <New0> hampsterblade, yea i know that. from other language. but there it was OOP style not JS style realy BUMMER
[12:08:15] <New0> hampsterblade, if i only knew how with jQuery it was much easyier
[12:08:34] <hampsterblade> I'm parsing in PHP, making a json file, and then pulling it with .getJSON
[12:09:04] <hampsterblade> Not so much that the actual parsing is hard, just that the layout of the xml document is retarded.  crappy api
[12:09:31] <hampsterblade> but the information there is good, so I'm stuck with it
[12:09:54] <New0> hampsterblade, yea this the language i am talking about. the PHP but i did it with QueryPath nice and easy. try this out
[12:10:16] <New0> well the JSON is much light so...
[12:10:51] <New0> hampsterblade, u know u can modify ur api of ur XML with XSML i think
[12:11:05] <hampsterblade> I'm gzipping it before I send it, because even with a lot of information cut out and the best layout I could come up with it's still big
[12:11:14] <MindSpark> is there any way I can pass an entire html document to jquery to parse it?
[12:11:49] <hampsterblade> You could call it with an ajax call
[12:13:33] <MindSpark> hampsterblade, I did that, but when I pass the returned data to $() I get an array with elements rather than one element with the hierarchy
[12:13:43] <MindSpark> hierarchy = dom
[12:14:38] <hampsterblade> You can load the returned value into a div and parse it there
[12:15:52] <hampsterblade> http://jcon.mhamptontech.com/anidbcache.php?list=true  this is my output  http://anidb.net/api/animetitles.xml.gz  this is the original sml
[12:15:55] <hampsterblade> *xml
[12:16:22] <hampsterblade> Not really sure how to make it any smaller besides not using named values
[12:16:33] <hampsterblade> but that just makes it hard to work with
[12:17:44] <MindSpark> hampsterblade, why?
[12:18:00] <hampsterblade> why what?
[12:18:12] <MindSpark> I am logging the output and there's a "text," string before each of the elements
[12:18:16] <Renari> When I submit data to a php page to be processed for some reason my data keeps getting cut off at an ampersand would anyone know what I'm doing wrong here?
[12:18:34] <Renari> http://pastebin.com/http://pastebin.com/CPkyU8zc
[12:18:38] <Renari> uh, http://pastebin.com/CPkyU8zc
[12:18:44] <Renari> is my code
[12:19:24] <Renari> and when I send the string [img]http://site.com/image.php?u=204&dateline=1332517171[/img][img]http://site.com/image.php?u=107&dateline=1332323508[/img]
[12:19:42] <Renari> the datastring alert shows the full string
[12:19:50] <hampsterblade> you need to urlencode it
[12:19:56] <Renari> however the data recieved only goes up to the first &
[12:20:03] <hampsterblade> http://www.digitalbart.com/blog/jquery-and-urlencode/
[12:20:11] <Renari> thanks
[12:21:08] <hampsterblade> have you tried doing something like $.AJAX('url', function(data){
[12:21:29] <hampsterblade> var output = (string)data;
[12:21:35] <hampsterblade> and then parsing it?
[12:21:44] <hampsterblade> MindSpark
[12:22:29] <MindSpark> hampsterblade, no, but loading it into a div works, however. Some javascript is also run, and I need to find a way how to prevent running part of that js
[12:22:38] <MindSpark> I'll try type casting it now
[12:24:50] <Renari> hm URLEncode doesn't seem to be working $.URLEncode(datastring) is returning: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'URLEncode'
[12:27:05] <Renari> nvm it seems this is not a jquery function
[12:28:17] <hampsterblade> encodeURI(datastring);

[12:28:26] <bot-t> Renari, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:29:48] <hampsterblade> encodeURIComponent(datastring) may work better for what you're trying to do
[12:36:49] <Renari> Thanks, that helped me with debugging however there isn't any errors in my code outside of & cutting off the data being sent.
[12:37:07] <Renari> I tried encodeURI like suggested but that didn't fix it.
[12:37:39] <hampsterblade> Paste your code somewhere so I can see what kind of datastring you're working with
[12:38:23] <Renari> hampsterblade: http://pastebin.com/STBiGqat
[12:39:09] <hampsterblade> encodeURIComponent(datastring) may work better for what you're trying to do
[12:41:22] <Renari> hampsterblade: for some reason after changing encodeURI to encodeURIComponent now no data is being returned instead of just the data to the first &
[12:42:33] <hampsterblade> http://pastebin.com/2MaH0pb8  try it that way
[12:43:49] <Renari> hampsterblade: empty string gets returned
[12:44:08] <hampsterblade> ahh I know what it is now
[12:44:10] <Renari> wait
[12:44:34] <Renari> i still had the other 2 as encodeURIComponent
[12:44:44] <hampsterblade> http://pastebin.com/kUTnGD2y
[12:45:04] <hampsterblade> the equal sign would have changed the other way
[12:45:27] <Renari> OH
[12:45:37] <Renari> right it was encoding the equal sign thus messing up the ajax
[12:45:59] <bricker88> Sorry if this is a little too vague - So in a mobile browser, when you click something, it fires off mouseover, mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, and mouseclick, in that order. I have an overlay on mouseover (desktop) or touch (mobile) of a link, and when I mouse out (desktop) or touch the document body (mobile), it disappears. My problem is that on Mobile, if I touch the element again, it fires off the next thing in the chain 
[12:46:23] <Renari> hampsterblade: thanks a lot works now
[12:46:29] <hampsterblade> np
[12:50:47] <hampsterblade> bricker, you can check for mobile using something like this http://pastebin.com/FYyLTEYZ
[12:50:59] <hampsterblade> bricker88, you can check for mobile using something like this http://pastebin.com/FYyLTEYZ
[12:51:37] <bricker88> hampsterblade: Cool, thank you for that
[12:56:35] <Porpado> when i animate something it applies an inline style overriding the linked stylesheet styles. How would I animate back to the values of the original linked stylesheet, in effect reversing the animation?
[12:57:05] <Porpado> is there a way i can reference the values from the stylesheet without hardcoding them somewhere
[12:59:00] <hampsterblade> Porpado are you trying to store the original values, change them and then change them back to the original?
[12:59:26] <Porpado> yes, i am wondering if there is a way to do this without hardcoding the original values into the animation
[12:59:44] <Porpado> id rather just reference the stylesheet, which contains the original values
[12:59:49] <Porpado> or something like that
[13:00:24] <hampsterblade> While you could parse the stylesheet, it'd be more efficient to store them before the animation runs
[13:02:10] <hampsterblade> you could also try something like this.  Add a class to the animation, and remove it when you are done Porpado
[13:02:17] <hampsterblade> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/955030/remove-css-from-a-div-using-jquery
[13:04:10] <Porpado> if i do that how would I achieve the animation?
[13:04:34] <Porpado> it would just snap to the new css instantly
[13:05:24] <hampsterblade> you could reference the old value using the original class or id, and remove the class when the animation is complete
[13:06:24] <hampsterblade> so you have something like div class=1, you add class 2, use the class 1 for the original values, and class 2 to handle your animations
[13:18:46] <hampsterblade> woo cut another 500KB of data, at the expense of human readability
[13:19:04] <nannes> ooooh Hi
[13:19:48] <shoky> Hy
[13:20:54] <nannes> I'm using the "load" function http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=mZabw6ad
[13:21:21] <nannes> in line 5 I'm trying to put a div with background-image to show **loading animation**
[13:21:37] <nannes> instead of the classic <img..........>
[13:21:48] <nannes> why doesn't it work?
[13:23:09] <hampsterblade> because your style tag is wrong
[13:23:47] <hampsterblade> style tag is for css, load_img is not css
[13:25:41] <nannes> hampsterblade: it is!
[13:26:42] <hampsterblade> is load_img supposed to be a class or id or something, because it's definitely not css
[13:27:22] <abnormalex> hey, i need something along the lines of, if div clicked, but if div inside div not clicked
[13:27:53] <abnormalex> so if #containForm.click BUT .click is not #containFormButton
[13:28:21] <nannes> it's a class hampsterblade
[13:28:25] <nannes> CSS --> pavimentideluxe.altervista.org/test/css/base.css
[13:28:35] <hampsterblade> nannes then use class= not style=
[13:28:36] <nannes> PAGE --> pavimentideluxe.altervista.org/test/
[13:28:53] <jrockjiggz> hi, does anyone know how to append a variable to your URI whether vars already exist or not?
[13:29:11] <abnormalex> basically I have a modal div with a form, and I Have $(document).click(function() { to hide the modal if clicked outside the modal
[13:29:24] <abnormalex> but I have this preventing hiding the modal if the click is inside the modal:
[13:29:25] <abnormalex> $("#modalNewPage .containForm").click(function(){ return false; });
[13:29:26] <nannes> LOOOOOOOOOL YOU JUST SHOWED ME THAT I AM REALLY REALLY HIGH
[13:29:27] <jrockjiggz> if(uri has no vars){ '?' } else{ '&' } ?
[13:29:38] <Brodingo_> nannes kind of a waste to qualify all those ids, the div is not really necessary
[13:29:43] <hampsterblade> abnormalex set a variable clicked = false, set it to true when the inner div is clicked, and check the variable on the outter div click event, if it's true set it back to false, if it's false, do the stuff
[13:29:44] <pifantastic> ?:not @ abnormalex
[13:29:45] <bot-t> abnormalex, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[13:30:08] <abnormalex> but the problem is, that return false is preventing my php form action from being excecuted
[13:30:12] <nannes> Brodingodo I use img class directly?
[13:30:46] <shoelessone> Anybody happent o know of an IE7 bug that causes issues when you show/hide a div that has contents in it? I'm trying to hide a "popup" modal window that I've created, and then show it again. The problem is that in IE7 when I hide it the DOM or something seem to get all messed up, and the actual content of the div is not displayed correctly (or at all), as if the contents of the div are also hidding
[13:30:58] <Brodingo_> nannes i meant for all the other styles in your style sheet, every thing is div#id, just #id should be ok in most cases
[13:31:15] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: The minified "latest" JS file on the CDN is having a bad hair day. Issue updates here: http://t.co/H44WKllo ★ http://bit.ly/HgPJoK
[13:31:21] <abnormalex> pifantastic: but can you do If this is clicked but :not this?
[13:31:53] <bricker88> abnormalex: The best way I've found to accomplish that is something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hq9nU/
[13:32:03] <bricker88> That is coffee script but I think you'll get the idea
[13:32:16] <nannes> Brodingo Oh I know..! it's the html editor
[13:32:17] <Brodingo_> lolllwutttttt
[13:32:24] <abnormalex> thanks bricker88 ill try that
[13:32:39] <pifantastic> abnormalex: $("#modalNewPage .containForm:not(#containFormButton").click(function(){ return false; });
[13:33:00] <pifantastic> abnormalex: $("#modalNewPage .containForm div:not(#containFormButton").click(function(){ return false; }); rather
[13:33:52] <abnormalex> hmmm
[13:33:54] <abnormalex> that looks easy
[13:34:39] <hampsterblade> http://pastebin.com/xWNkMjRY  this is how I would handle it abnormalex
[13:35:36] <hampsterblade> - a few syntax errors lol
[13:36:04] <abnormalex> pifantastic: that function is closing my modal box even if clicked inside
[13:36:07] <Brodingo_> ehh id rather do something with a parent node and check event.target
[13:36:13] <abnormalex> i mean in the modal, outside the button
[13:37:22] <abnormalex> $("#modalNewPage .containForm div:not(#btnNewPage)").click
[13:37:52] <bricker88> abnormalex: Did you look at my method? It just checks three things: Is the modal visible, and the click target wasn't the modal element itself, and the click target wasn't a descendent of the modal element? Then hide it.
[13:38:20] <bricker88> abnormalex: Maybe I am misunderstanding what you're trying to accomplish
[13:39:03] <Brodingo_> bricker88 maybe a jquery example wouldve been better
[13:39:23] <abnormalex> bricker88: sorry ill check that, his method just seemed quickest, one line
[13:39:35] <bricker88> I
[13:39:42] <bricker88> I'll rewrite it in jquery
[13:39:45] <abnormalex> and this does not allow the button to submit the form
[13:39:45] <abnormalex> $("#modalNewPage .containForm:not(#btnNewPage)").click
[13:41:21] <abnormalex> not working
[13:41:22] <abnormalex> $("#modalNewPage .containForm").not("#btnNewPage").click(function(){ return false; });
[13:42:24] <bricker88> http://jsfiddle.net/hq9nU/1/
[13:43:01] <abnormalex> bricker88: that does cover anything about the button
[13:43:23] <abnormalex> maybe && !$(event.target).is("#modalButton")
[13:43:30] <bricker88> okay I missed that part, thought you were just trying to conditionally hide the modal on document click
[13:44:29] <abnormalex> well your method doesnt return false, so maybe it will work
[13:45:00] <abnormalex> is that jquery... it looks different
[13:45:14] <abnormalex> nvm looked at the old one
[13:45:15] <shoelessone> Is it "bad" to have a bunch of bind events on a page that are not relevant? I have like 15 jquery bindings in a JS file that I load on all of the pages of my site, but only some of them are actually ralvent at any given time.
[13:45:25] <shoelessone> I did this to reduce the number of JS files being included
[13:46:04] <hampsterblade> depends on the size of the functions, it will reduce number of requests, so it's not necessarily bad
[13:46:09] <bricker88> shoelessone: 15 is not that big of a deal.
[13:46:12] <Brodingo_> fewer http request is always good shoelessone
[13:46:13] <hampsterblade> As long as it's not causing errors
[13:46:35] <shoelessone> OK, cool. I'll keep them in one file then, thanks guys <3
[13:46:59] <freeed> shoelessone, I usually just wrap functions like that in a if (elem.length == 1) { function… } so avoid any errors if the element does not exist on a specific page
[13:47:12] <freeed> *to avoid
[13:48:03] <shoelessone> freeed: thanks for the tip! My understanding though is that bind/live will basically just act on the result of the select, so if nothing is there then it just will do nothing. It adds a bit of overhead because it's doing the DOM "lookup"
[13:48:17] <shoelessone> but it shouldn't break anything ever, I don't think (?)
[13:49:42] <freeed> shoelessone, nah - but if you're including say jquery cycle only on pages that have a slideshow and you're calling elem.cycle() on everypage you will get an error like .cycle() does not exist.. don't know if you're doing anything like that *shrug*
[13:49:43] <hampsterblade> #php
[13:49:56] <hampsterblade> lol sorry, forgot to type /join
[13:50:47] <jrockjiggz> i can't figure where is syntax error :( http://jsfiddle.net/uU33b/
[13:51:57] <freeed> jrockjiggz, that last parenthesis
[13:52:10] <jrockjiggz> ahh thanks
[13:52:21] <freeed> jrockjiggz, or the second to large I suppose… no problem :)
[13:52:27] <freeed> *second to last

[14:03:51] <New0> hi everyone. i want to use jQuery to navigate in table and create more tr in it
[14:04:33] <New0> how can i do it? $('#song').children('tr'); #song is the table id
[14:06:14] <Mike> I have a problem detecting childs
[14:06:20] <Mike> On http://www.featuredhomelistings.com/mls/?mls_id=naples&sale_price=30000000&bedrooms=0&baths_full=0&city=NAPLES&p_type=s
[14:06:43] <Guest72886> In the left nav menu I need to auto collapse the division after the second li
[14:07:01] <Guest72886> to do that in the first its easy.. $('.acc_trigger:first').addClass('active').next().show();
[14:07:15] <Guest72886> However there is obviously no :second selector so I am stuck
[14:07:24] <Guest72886> Can anyone give me some assisatance :D
[14:07:48] <nFFF> ?next
[14:07:48] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/

[14:08:04] <bot-t> nFFF, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[14:08:16] <Guest72886> the problem is I have divs inbetween the <li>s
[14:08:16] <nFFF> thats the one :>
[14:08:34] <Guest72886> so I would assume its notworking because :nth-child is selecting the wrong item
[14:09:04] <nFFF> I dont know your markup
[14:09:38] <nFFF> do you have a fiddle?
[14:10:11] <New0> hi everyone. i want to use jQuery to navigate in table and create more tr in it
[14:10:14] <New0> how can i do it? $('#song').children('tr'); #song is the table id
[14:11:08] <Guest72886> Hold on, I am submitting it to pastebin :)
[14:11:19] <nFFF> put it in a fiddle

[14:13:36] <rroelofs> New0: $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#song tr') will give you a list of the rows you already have
[14:13:45] <Guest72886> http://pastebin.com/bEsPuMnN
[14:14:11] <rroelofs> so much for copy  & paste :-)
[14:16:40] <rroelofs> Guest72886: I think what nFFF  is trying to tell you is that you can't put divs between lis
[14:18:54] <Guest72886> #rroelofs: damn
[14:19:15] <New0> rroelofs, sorry didnt understnd
[14:19:54] <rroelofs> New0: $("#song tr") gives you a list of rows but does not alter the table.
[14:20:41] <New0> rroelofs, ohh tnx
[14:20:55] <rroelofs> New0: You can do $("#song tbody").append("<tr>...</tr>) to add rows
[14:21:01] <rroelofs> but there are better ways
[14:21:43] <New0> rroelofs, problem not all brower support auto create of tbody. so the table is tricky
[14:22:22] <New0> append add after the last one right? and what is the better ways?
[14:22:44] <New0> even it's not a table. just need to make a list of records
[14:24:05] <rroelofs> this is old but I am still using DataTables.  http://www.webdesignbooth.com/15-great-jquery-plugins-for-better-table-manipulation/
[14:24:46] <rroelofs> I've become a backbonejs fan for web apps
[14:25:28] <New0> what is backbonejs?
[14:25:59] <New0> rroelofs, u think there is better way with other tags than table tr....? like ul li
[14:27:27] <rroelofs> New0: Table markup sounds fine to me.  I meant that translating db records to table rows cries out for some kind of templating
[14:27:52] <rroelofs> underscore has an adequate templating engine and is quite small
[14:28:24] <New0> ok :) u almost lost me (kind of newbie) :)
[14:28:32] <rroelofs> backbonejs http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[14:28:34] <New0> rroelofs, but tnx man
[14:29:41] <rroelofs> it is a small midle layer that helps you segment your app and keep track of data flowing back and forth between the browser and the backend
[14:29:54] <rroelofs> I have no idea what size project you are working on.
[14:30:21] <rroelofs> so feel free to ignore it
[14:31:26] <New0> rroelofs, well anything is make me intrest
[14:31:37] <New0> but my project is small for now
[14:32:30] <New0> i only need to make one page that have one flash mp3 player and list of song.files.mp3 that i click a song and it's playing in the player.swf (flash)
[14:33:37] <New0> and the list i need it as list, table, ul li, or whatver. the thing is not the actuall list or table. but be able to click a song and make it sond by the player
[14:34:01] <New0> i will be happy i u can help me or anyone rroelofs
[14:37:08] <Guest72886> if I have a ul in side a ul li
[14:37:41] <rroelofs> New0: can you make a fiddle with a sample of what you want?  ?jsfiddle
[14:37:46] <Guest72886> does the ul li:nth-child(2) detect the second li inside the first ul? Or the 1st li inside the second ul inside the first li?

[14:39:09] <rroelofs> Guest72886: $("ul li:nth-child(2)") will get that li from all uls
[14:40:46] <New0> rroelofs, oh yes sure
[14:41:07] <Guest72886> @rroelofs: what about $("#mainulid ul li:nth-child(2)")
[14:41:53] <rroelofs> Guest72886: that should work depending on how the html is structured
[14:42:43] <rroelofs> try it and see.  you might need ul>li:nth-child...
[14:43:00] <Guest72886> @rroelofs: awesome, ill give it a try. thanks
[14:44:14] <rroelofs> Guest72886:  if possible you might ratherput the id on the ul and have #id>li:nth-child... to avoid getting any other descendents
[14:44:37] <Guest72886> that would work better
[14:47:09] <sunbeam> What is currently the best way to display / use a font that's not standard ? (eg. surface)

[14:54:30] <rroelofs> New0:  ids can be just numbers
[14:56:22] <New0> rroelofs, what u mean?
[14:56:43] <New0> rroelofs, like id=3, id=4, not: id="1", id ="2"?
[14:56:53] <rroelofs> your first id is currently 1  the spec says they can't start with digits
[14:57:10] <New0> right
[14:57:35] <New0> rroelofs, well does is it to be like the specs?
[14:59:07] <rroelofs> gotta run.  try this for a start  http://jsfiddle.net/uhG2T/3/
[15:02:32] <hampsterblade> This is so weird

[16:15:53] <Durmush> hi, i'm still new to javascript and jquery and I have a question. Whats the difference between POSTing with jquery.load() vs jquery.post() ?
[16:16:54] <tra> Durmush: .load performs a GET request, .post performs a POST request
[16:17:33] <Guest72886> best way to check if a class is not set in jquery?
[16:18:02] <Guest72886> I want to hide all items with a certain class unless one/some of the items have an "active" class already set
[16:18:28] <Durmush> I see...
[16:20:22] <dwbear> I have a function defined and I would like to set it to be the handler for a .click event. strange thing is that rather than just 'registering' the function to be called onclick, it actually executes the function onload.
[16:21:04] <dwbear> I've tried both .click and .on("click" myfunc) and the function gets called .onload.
[16:21:08] <dwbear> any pointers?
[16:24:07] <dwbear> I can go directly to the html element, and using onclick=myfunction('mystring') and have myfunction work as desired.
[16:24:58] <dwbear> So there must be some semantic difference between registering a handler via .click or .on and putting it on the element.
[16:25:48] <asidjazz> wtf is wrong w/ this

[16:27:45] <asidjazz> u too ansdev1

[16:38:44] <Marco-123> hi all. im trying to perform an ajax call but having a problem with the url. the php framework im using uses urls like this "action=oink;area=anotheroink;sa=1212". ive got a php function ready to go and when i access it directly it works great. when i pass the same url string to the URL portion of jquery's ajax function, it doesnt call the php function. any ideas? are semi colons a problem?
[16:44:52] <johnkpaul> ?eval encodeURIComponent(";")
[16:44:55] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "%3B"
[16:44:59] <johnkpaul> @ Marco-123
[16:47:37] <Marco-123> ah i figured it out. not a jquery issue at all
[16:53:37] <silverhand> I have a li item that expands when I click on it, but the mouseout event triggers when I move the mouse outside the original, unexpanded area. Do I have to do something special to get the mouse to include the new, expanded area?
[16:54:04] <silverhand> I am 'expanding' by adding a new class to a originally hidden area of the li element that makes it display.
[16:56:23] <silverhand> Solution: user hover instead of mouseover and mouseout
[17:03:57] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:04:20] <lenswipe> should i use ajax $.post() or $.ajax() ?
[17:11:19] <johnkpaul> lenswipe: what do you mean? you can use either
[17:11:26] <lenswipe> ok
[17:11:29] <lenswipe> another question is
[17:11:30] <johnkpaul> $.post is a convenience function around $.ajax
[17:12:08] <lenswipe> when i use ajax post how do i take data from my form and send it back to the server using $.ajax?
[17:12:34] <Arimil> is there a way to wrap an element in new tags?
[17:12:57] <johnkpaul> ?wrap @Arimil
[17:12:58] <bot-t> Arimil, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[17:13:10] <Arimil> thanks
[17:13:11] <johnkpaul> ?ajax @lenswipe
[17:13:11] <bot-t> lenswipe, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:13:30] <johnkpaul> read that link, and look for the "data" property inside the options object
[17:16:10] <lenswipe> johnkpaul, yeah ive read the docs
[17:16:20] <lenswipe> its just it looks like $.ajax only works with JSON/XML
[17:19:36] <johnkpaul> lenswipe: that's not true
[17:19:44] <lenswipe> ok
[17:20:02] <johnkpaul> by default, I'm pretty sure the content type is www/formencoded
[17:20:29] <rado-> Trying to style a image scroller and not having too much luck. I managed to flip it vertically, but I cannot get the border to behave it is narrower than the images it holds.. I'm out of my comfort zone, I hope someone can give me hand.

[17:21:39] <bot-t> rado-, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[17:25:29] <rado-> johnkpaul: thanks for the link, but in this instance I'm in a little over my head. I've used jsfiddle, but this has me confused.
[17:25:57] <johnkpaul> :) I didn't mean that you need to learn jsfiddle, I mean it'd be useful if you could make a live example in jsfiddle

[17:27:21] <johnkpaul> sure
[17:28:53] <lenswipe> johnkpaul, is there a way to reset an element?
[17:29:08] <johnkpaul> what do you mean?
[17:29:18] <lenswipe> say i add classes to an element and add content to it then fade it out, how do i reset the element to the state it was in when the page loaded without reloading the page
[17:30:35] <johnkpaul> hm, there's no quick and easy .reset() if that's what you're looking for
[17:30:47] <johnkpaul> you can store all of the original state, and then reset programatically
[17:30:55] <johnkpaul> you could .clone()
[17:31:02] <johnkpaul> and then remove the old one and reattach the cloned one
[17:34:58] <johnkpaul> ?learn @rado-
[17:34:59] <bot-t> rado-, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[18:01:25] <Arimil> can you use remove() to remove just the selected element leaving elements it contains there?
[18:04:03] <Arimil> for example if i use $('.container').remove() on this code
[18:04:04] <Arimil> <div class="container"> <div class="hello">Hello</div> <div class="goodbye">Goodbye</div>
[18:04:07] <Arimil> </div>
[18:04:20] <Arimil> it removed hellow and goodbye as well
[18:04:38] <Arimil> hello*, is there a way to make it just remove container?
[18:13:58] <Arimil> figured it out, unwrap
[18:14:08] <jamarcuss> is there any reason *not* to be using the jquery ui widget factory for creating plugins?
[18:14:57] <jamarcuss> i kind of like the minimalistic approach that the regular plugin documentation takes, but there's also some neat stuff in the widget factory
[18:19:35] <CrazyZurfer> hello
[18:20:57] <CrazyZurfer> is there a possible way to submit a dynamic form.. I mean a form with variable quantity of imputs
[18:21:08] <CrazyZurfer> and do it with ajax?
[18:21:55] <Arimil> CrazyZurfer: yes
[18:22:04] <CrazyZurfer> how can I do that?
[18:22:35] <CrazyZurfer> because I don't know how many imputs i'm going to have, so I can't use load for example to send the data
[18:22:36] <Arimil> CrazyZurfer: with a for loop on elements with the same class
[18:23:27] <Arimil> use the for loop to generate a datastring and then submit the ajax with the datastring
[18:31:20] <Arimil> Does anyone know what could be wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/7Avxv/ the form isn't getting submit to the iframe. Is that because I'm removing the form from the DOM before the upload completes?
[18:34:31] <CrazyZurfer> Arimil: Another question... is there a possible way to use load() but.. send the POST in the way d1='asd'&d2="asdf" and not in the way: d1: 'asd', d2: 'asdf'
[18:34:33] <CrazyZurfer> ??
[18:35:30] <falcom> what's the equivalent to $('#ul li')...  when var u = $('#ul');  // i want to use variable u to select the li inside of it
[18:36:41] <johnkpaul> ?find @falcom
[18:36:41] <bot-t> falcom, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[18:37:09] <LordThumper> u.find("li")
[18:37:13] <johnkpaul> CrazyZurfer: "data" can handle www/formencoded
[18:37:24] <johnkpaul> so just pass the string to data
[18:37:42] <LordThumper> or u.children("li")
[18:38:01] <Arimil> CrazyZurfer: I'm not sure, sorry.
[18:38:09] <johnkpaul> children isn't "#ul li" it's "#ul > li"
[18:38:29] <CrazyZurfer> johnkpaul: but in the load?.. like this?  $("#resultado").load("formulario.php", { a=1&b=2&c=3&d=4&e=5 });
[18:38:29] <johnkpaul> .find is descendants, .children is children
[18:38:54] <johnkpaul> CrazyZurfer: .load("whatever.php",{data:"yourformencodedstring"})
[18:39:15] <CrazyZurfer> i'll try
[18:40:14] <LordThumper> johnkpaul: You are right, but li are generally direct descendants of ul
[18:40:21] <LordThumper> i.e. children. Or am I wrong?
[18:40:57] <johnkpaul> oh, definitely, usually, that's just not what was asked for
[18:42:10] <LordThumper> Could be. I sometimes misread things.
[18:47:25] <CrazyZurfer> any idea of why load is not working here? :S
[18:47:25] <CrazyZurfer> http://201.215.253.117/tarea%208/diaz/index.php
[18:47:59] <CrazyZurfer> first field, you put how muny grades you have

[18:48:27] <CrazyZurfer> then it shows you the fields to put your grades and then it shows you the average
[18:48:41] <falcom> i want to bind an event handler to a element. when it changes (contain an extra or less element) it will do something.. however .change() doesnt seem to be the right one, as it only is in effect when i interact with that element directly
[18:48:53] <CrazyZurfer> any idea of what i'm doing wrong?
[18:48:57] <jrockjiggz> ?demo @ CrazyZurfer
[18:48:58] <bot-t> CrazyZurfer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:49:05] <falcom> ex: have an external button that will add a div to that element
[18:49:12] <CrazyZurfer> the problem is that i use php on it...
[18:49:17] <CrazyZurfer> si cant use jsfiddle
[18:49:20] <johnkpaul> falcom: do you mean when you change the value programatically?
[18:49:20] <CrazyZurfer> so..*
[18:49:31] <johnkpaul> you'll need to trigger the event yourself programatically in that case
[18:49:34] <CrazyZurfer> http://201.215.253.117/tarea%208/diaz/index.php   -> demo
[18:49:37] <johnkpaul> .trigger("change")
[18:50:42] <falcom> johnkpaul: i see.. that kinda sucks, but guess there's no way
[18:50:50] <CrazyZurfer> +bot-t: already sent a demo
[18:51:19] <johnkpaul> no, there's no way, that's the point of how the event system works, when you change it using JS, it doesn't act as if the user made the changes
[18:51:26] <abjorn> asdf
[18:51:37] <johnkpaul> the other option is to _really_ create progamatic events

[18:52:53] <CrazyZurfer> ok... forget about ajax.. this is madness
[18:52:56] <abjorn> o my
[18:53:04] <Eviltwin> AJAX is hard, guys
[18:58:27] <CrazyZurfer> I know
[19:07:50] <beancurd> ajax is srs bsns
[19:12:59] <jamarcuss> are there any downsides to using the jquery ui widget factory vs a more traditional plugin model?
[19:16:14] <danzik17> jamarcuss: well, a dependency on ui.widget for one.  that's not a big downside though.
[19:17:02] <Eviltwin> jamarcuss: The only downside I can think of is that it doesn't have a great mechanism for manufacturing elements
[19:17:07] <Eviltwin> It's really designed to work on existing structures
[19:17:19] <Eviltwin> But that's what I want a plugin for most of the time anyway
[19:19:19] <Arimil> does anyone see something wrong with the way I'm doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/7Avxv/4/ the form is never getting submit to the iframe as far as I can tell.
[19:23:05] <shoky> seems fine to me
[19:23:38] <shoky> you do know your iframe is not visible, yeh?
[19:25:29] <jamarcuss> thanks
[19:27:50] <techouse> so i wrote myself a php function that gets me some data and doesn't take any parameters to do so. how do call it via jquery's ajax when i don't have any data to send? will $.ajax work with an empty data property?
[19:28:06] <Eviltwin> Yes...
[19:28:23] <techouse> do i HAVE to specify it or can i simply leave it out?
[19:28:38] <Eviltwin> Simply leave it out
[19:28:41] <techouse> k
[19:28:42] <techouse> :)
[19:28:43] <Eviltwin> This is all explained

[19:36:32] <javajosh> hi everybody! I was wondering if someone could help me figure out why a dynamically added element does not look right http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/qZYG3/1/
[19:37:02] <javajosh> thanks in advance.
[19:38:45] <javajosh> nm got it
[19:43:18] <aro> paul_irish: are you around?
[19:46:13] <Eviltwin> You must refer to him as Mr. Irish here
[19:46:23] <Eviltwin> If you want a response
[19:46:30] <aro> alright
[19:46:45] <aro> Mr. Irish, are you around?
[19:47:22] <Eviltwin> He might just not be here
[19:47:25] <Eviltwin> That's also a possibility
[19:47:32] <aro> have you used his infinite scroll plugin?
[19:47:36] <coldhead> he might be very much here and just refusing to help
[19:47:44] <coldhead> because there's only so much he can give
[19:47:50] <coldhead> and you people are like vultures
[19:47:56] <coldhead> picking picking picking
[19:48:06] <justinhjohnson> "what do you mean, 'you people'?"
[19:48:24] <Eviltwin> justinhjohnson: What do you mean "you people"?
[19:48:31] <Ring0`> Hey. How can I trigger jQuery if $(window) changes (for example by opening searchbar in firefox (the windows height changes).
[19:48:34] <justinhjohnson> well, err, i....
[19:48:39] <justinhjohnson> :D
[19:48:52] <Eviltwin> Ring0`: Might get a resize even if you're lucky
[19:49:02] <Eviltwin> event*
[19:49:12] <Ring0`> Eviltwin: i'll try
[19:50:44] <Eviltwin> aro: Just ask your question
[19:51:07] <aro> well i am using the infinite scroll plugin, and i was wondering if there was a way to make it fadein/animate after it has finished loading the content
[19:51:09] <markq> when a object is instantiated via a constructor function the new object has access to the constructor's prototype right? and the constructor's protypical methods are not copied to the new object's prototype are they?
[19:51:16] <aro> instead of fading it in and then have the images still be loading
[19:51:49] <justinhjohnson> they are unless you use prototypal inheritance
[19:51:57] <dbb> hi all- complete jquery beginner here.. I am trying to get a lightbox() function to work in my wordpress page..   I used  $("#gallery a") to select.. but its not working at all
[19:52:09] <Ring0`> Eviltwin: haha, `something` triggers since I just set to throw alert but it does something like that with browser: http://cap.ring0.cc/b1716be0a5f6c2eb1874301c2392f8b4.png
[19:52:16] <Ring0`> yes, this is full FF window.
[19:53:41] <dbb> something is screwy because in Firefbug console, I do  $("#gallery") and it comes back null.. all queries so far have come back null
[19:54:08] <Eviltwin> aro: Is it a fadein?
[19:54:15] <aro> Eviltwin: yes
[19:54:20] <Eviltwin> dbb: Odds are you also have MooTools or something on your site
[19:54:31] <johnkpaul-afk> dbb: try jQuery instead of $
[19:54:36] <dbb> this is a brand new wordpress install
[19:54:42] <dbb> ok trying
[19:54:49] <Eviltwin> aro: Does it also scroll?
[19:54:58] <aro> yes
[19:55:15] <dbb> johnkpaul-afk: haha
[19:55:21] <dbb> something came back
[19:55:22] <Eviltwin> Huh, I see the scroll but not the fade in except for when it hits the end
[19:55:58] <aro> after its loaded the new content, it fades it in
[19:56:00] <johnkpaul-afk> dbb: good, so you have some other library probaby that uses $
[19:56:06] <aro> however the content thats being faded in hasnt finished loading
[19:57:10] <Eviltwin> Looks like he has functions to allow you to override behavior if you extend it
[19:58:07] <dbb> ugh - ok, progress but not yet success...  the expression jQuery("#gallery a") does return an array, but I dont have the lightbox effect yet
[19:58:20] <RobW> meh.. I'm trying to figure out how to make an element gradually go DOWN (css "bottom") when page goes UP.. ideas??
[19:58:25] <RobW> I can't figure this out and I'm getting flustered heh
[19:58:33] <dbb> (I am trying for this http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/ )
[19:59:39] <Eviltwin> aro: So it looks like if you set a "behavior" (in this case "foobar") you can do $.infinitescroll.prototype._loadcallback_foobar = function(box, data) { ... };
[19:59:52] <Eviltwin> And that'll replace what happens when content loads
[20:00:35] <Eviltwin> This is the current loadcallback: https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/jquery.infinitescroll.js#L265-324
[20:00:43] <Eviltwin> You could also just overwrite that
[20:03:21] <RobW> anyone? ;
[20:04:45] <aro> i mean, is there a way to just defer it until the content has fully loaded?
[20:05:03] <Eviltwin> aro: Not a build in function for it, no.
[20:05:07] <Eviltwin> At least not as far as I can tell
[20:05:19] <Eviltwin> The trick is the load event doesn't bubble
[20:05:26] <Eviltwin> And you wouldn't even know how many of them to expect in the first place
[20:05:37] <Eviltwin> So you actually need to select the things you want to wait for and wait for them explicitly
[20:05:49] <justinhjohnson> RobW: ?scrollTop
[20:05:55] <justinhjohnson> or not
[20:06:24] <aro> so .load doesnt have a (loaded) type event?
[20:06:27] <coldhead> RobW: http://webdesigncrowd.com/11-inspirational-fixed-position-menus/
[20:06:34] <Eviltwin> aro: ?
[20:06:34] <coldhead> ee if there's something stealable in there
[20:08:07] <aro> well its loading some content, i just wondered if there was an event for when the content and its stuff had loaded
[20:08:38] <Eviltwin> Certain elements have an event for when that element has loaded
[20:08:46] <Eviltwin> Like <IMG>s and <IFRAME>s
[20:09:10] <Eviltwin> But that event doesn't bubble
[20:09:20] <Eviltwin> And you wouldn't know how many of them to listen for unless you counted them
[20:09:40] <Eviltwin> What I'm saying is that what you're asking is probably doable but you need to actually select the things you want to wait for and wait for them
[20:09:47] <RobW> coldhead: not what i'm really looking for
[20:10:04] <justinhjohnson> RobW: setup an event listener on window scroll
[20:10:34] <justinhjohnson> and check the .scrollTop() of an element
[20:10:50] <coldhead> it is too what you're looking for
[20:10:53] <justinhjohnson> use that to increment or decrement your bottom property
[20:10:55] <coldhead> you'll be back
[20:11:02] <RobW> http://tinyurl.com/7thphyq - scroll all the way down. you'll see the "TOP" div pop up on bottom right, atop the footer div.. now, when you slowly start scrolling up, I want that to gradually tuck below the footer div
[20:11:24] <RobW> maybe that helps explain what i want heh
[20:11:46] <RobW> right now it's way too fast.. but same idea
[20:17:36] <Eviltwin> RobW: http://jsfiddle.net/besur/
[20:17:45] <Eviltwin> What do you say?
[20:18:05] <Eviltwin> Actually I have no idea if that's what you were looking for
[20:18:10] <Eviltwin> It's just what I felt like building
[20:18:23] <RobW> lol Eviltwin: now negate that effect
[20:18:33] <Eviltwin> You mean show instead of hide?
[20:18:35] <RobW> and then it'll be close.. but read what I had put
[20:18:37] <Eviltwin> OR what
[20:18:43] <RobW> http://tinyurl.com/7thphyq - scroll all the way down. you'll see the "TOP" div pop up on bottom right, atop the footer div.. now, when you slowly start scrolling up, I want that to gradually tuck below the footer div
[20:18:51] <RobW> it needs to tuck behind a div.
[20:19:00] <RobW> so probably need to use $(div).offset().top as well
[20:19:28] <Eviltwin> RobW: Well do you think this is enough for you to work off?
[20:20:05] <Eviltwin> I can explain what's happening if you're not suire
[20:20:06] <Eviltwin> sure*
[20:21:34] <Eviltwin> The pcent is the somewhat tricky part but makes the rest of the logic really easy to customize
[20:22:03] <RobW> lol look now
[20:22:09] <RobW> ($(window).scrollTop()-$("#footer").offset().top+($("#footer").height()*3.2))+"px"
[20:22:17] <RobW> that 3.2 has to be *something* else in order to work
[20:22:33] <RobW> I really suck at this
[20:23:08] <Eviltwin> Can you explain the effect you're trying to achieve
[20:23:14] <Eviltwin> I didn't quite understand
[20:23:58] <RobW> once scrolled all the way down, the more you scroll up, the more it "tucks" behind the footer
[20:24:12] <Eviltwin> Is that what happens or is that what you want to happen?
[20:24:39] <Eviltwin> Oh
[20:24:43] <RobW> that's what I want to happen lol
[20:24:43] <Eviltwin> So you hit the bottom (all the way?)
[20:24:49] <Eviltwin> Then Top is supposed to show up
[20:24:50] <RobW> kind of like reverse parrallax scrolling
[20:24:53] <RobW> yes
[20:24:54] <Eviltwin> And hide as you scroll up?
[20:25:00] <Eviltwin> But you don't want it to show that way?
[20:25:03] <RobW> yes, gradually, not a complete/instant hide
[20:25:14] <RobW> while the footer is visible, the "top" button should show/hide
[20:25:18] <RobW> make sense?
[20:25:28] <RobW> once the footer is out of view, the top button should also be out of view
[20:25:41] <Eviltwin> So should they be linked both directions?
[20:25:42] <Eviltwin> Or just the one?
[20:25:51] <Eviltwin> Like should it expand as the footer comes into view
[20:25:59] <Eviltwin> But before you hit the hard bottom
[20:26:18] <RobW> yes
[20:26:21] <RobW> both ways should be gradual
[20:26:44] <RobW> so while footer is in view (306px height) the "TOP" button should also gradually become visible.. 100% visible once all the way scrolled down
[20:26:56] <RobW> if footer is only 50% visible, then the "TOP" button should also be 50% visible, tucking behind footer.
[20:27:38] <Eviltwin> K
[20:28:23] <RobW> so if you're viewing that source, scripts.js, then technically I shouldn't even have an if/else statement there.
[20:28:33] <RobW> (as it should already be calculated based on scrolltop/offset/heights)
[20:28:41] <RobW> but what algorithm.. i have no earthly clue.
[20:44:58] <Eviltwin> RobW: http://jsfiddle.net/besur/1/
[20:45:38] <RobW> Eviltwin: oh nice
[20:46:07] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/besur/2/
[20:46:15] <Eviltwin> There was a little bug in the other one
[20:46:18] <Eviltwin> Didn't quite go all the way up
[20:46:59] <RobW> Ah I see
[20:47:15] <wiel> [ [ 'return', 'luke', 'warm', '15', '20', '1', '2', 'econ' ] ] what is the format for accessing an array like this? the elements i.e
[20:47:48] <Eviltwin> wiel: That format is referred to as JSON
[20:47:58] <Eviltwin> And if you have var arr = [ [ 'return', 'luke', 'warm', '15', '20', '1', '2', 'econ' ] ];
[20:48:06] <Eviltwin> arr[0][2] would be "warm"
[20:50:05] <RobW> ugh server went down ;\
[20:50:25] <RobW> Thanks Eviltwin - I think I came close to that once.. but not quite
[20:51:48] <gnarf> Eviltwin: although not really JSON per spec - double quotes required
[20:52:41] <RobW> wouldn't that just be an array inside an array item.. thought json was wrapped in curly braces?
[20:53:04] <Eviltwin> RobW: It's frequently the outermost container
[20:53:09] <Eviltwin> But doesn't have to be
[20:53:09] <Eviltwin> json.org
[20:53:13] <gnarf> RobW: arrays are also JSON syntax
[20:53:20] <RobW> oh ok
[20:53:24] <gnarf> {} are objects, [] arrays
[20:53:37] <Eviltwin> Technically this is JSON: 3.14
[20:54:56] <wiel> strarr["my"+arr[0]+"big"+arr[1]+"string"] i want to initialize strarr with a string.i cant do this because arr is given a value at a later time and if i try to initialize arr to [] then push a value onto arr i will have an additional array inside arr
[20:55:09] <wiel> which i dont want
[20:57:02] <wiel> can i push arr into a specific slot inside strarr?
[20:57:45] <Eviltwin> I didn't understand any of that
[20:59:07] <wiel> if i say var strarr["my"+arr[0]+"big"+arr[1]+"string"] when arr doesnt have a value ill get an error
[21:00:30] <wiel> if i initialize arr as an array  then push arr.push(//something); ill end up with [[//something]]
[21:02:30] <gnarf> ?101
[21:02:30] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[21:05:29] <wiel> still failing to understand?
[21:08:28] <gnarf> wiel: read the first few chapters of that book i linked
[21:08:31] <gnarf> it will help
[21:08:38] <gnarf> ?101 @wiel
[21:08:38] <bot-t> wiel, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[21:16:32] <wiel> nevermind. i used concat to solve my problem
[21:18:39] <disappearedng> Hey what do you call a kind of widget that is just a button at the edge of your screen and when you press it it will scroll out and you can see more of it?
[21:19:25] <gnarf> an expanding button?
[21:20:16] <gnarf> or $("#button").click( function() { $("#area").toggle(); });
[21:20:34] <disappearedng> um I also want to have multiple of them
[21:20:42] <disappearedng> would be nicer if there are plugins available
[21:21:35] <gnarf> $(".buttons").click( function() { $( $( this ).data('target') ).toggle(); });
[21:23:29] <RobW> Eviltwin - can I message you about something off-topic
[21:24:06] <gnarf> sexychat
[21:24:08] <disappearedng> gnarf: Kind of like this http://isenne.com/2010/06/add-a-button-to-the-edge-of-your-browser-with-edgebutton/
[21:32:35] <klocatelli> oh damn, I hate those things >_<
[21:33:06] <aro> eww
[21:36:40] <disappearedng> you got a better suggestion?
[22:11:40] <NivenHuH> to whoever added event namespacing..  much <3 goes out to you
[22:22:45] <aqeel> hi room
[22:22:57] <aqeel> how is everyone
[22:54:44] <rado-> Trying to figure out an issue with a jcarousel thumbnail scroller. In this screenshot the spot in blue has the height listed at 104px, but I'm not seeing a way to control it from css. http://puu.sh/nZKF
[23:33:53] <Arimil> Hm, so I have a form submiting to an iframe however when I try to get the output from the iframe suing var image = $('#imageupload').html(); it returns nothing. Looking at the DOM though the filename is indeed inside the iframe.
[23:36:43] <Validatorian> Anyone know how I would go about doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/QZMBb/ -- I basically want to call a specific object in an array based on its name, but I can't think of any way to do that efficiently (I could loop through it and rebuild an object, which I might end up doing, but one of your geniuses probably knows a better way)
[23:37:49] <Validatorian> map is probably the tool I need, but I'm not sure how to mark that up
[23:41:44] <Validatorian> perhaps something like .map(function () { return {this.name: this.link}})
[23:49:32] <Validatorian> anyone know how to return a new array from map, maybe?
[23:49:37] <Validatorian> er, new object
[23:50:16] <Flo0815> from $.map?
[23:50:32] <Validatorian> well, if that's what I should use -- I'm not positive
[23:50:35] <Validatorian> for http://jsfiddle.net/QZMBb/
[23:50:36] <Carlitta87> how do i add text to a simple slider....like content for each image?
[23:51:42] <Flo0815> Validatorian: so u want to put "name" inside a link with the target "linkforLies" or "linkforComments"?
[23:52:13] <Arimil> Am I not able to access the contents of an iframe from the same domain?
[23:52:40] <Flo0815> arimil: no not really
[23:52:54] <Validatorian> Flo0815: I want to access it so that the name is part of the object I'm calling -- actions.Comment.link -- I would rather not loop through each of them and check the name
[23:53:44] <Arimil> So does anyone have a solution for uploading an image then? Since apparently creating a temporary form and submiting it to an iframe doesn't work since you can't actually get any of the info about the image back from the iframe.
[23:54:08] <Flo0815> Validatorian: u can't. u need to use the index [0], because it's an array
[23:54:32] <Validatorian> ah
[23:54:34] <Flo0815> with comment.link u don't refer to a specific item
[23:54:43] <Validatorian> alright then, thanks Flo0815
[23:54:46] <Flo0815> np
[23:55:04] <Flo0815> Arimil: why u use an iframe
[23:55:25] <alexbodn> bye friends
[23:55:32] <Arimil> Flo0815: because I need to upload an image without refreshing the page and I read that an iframe is the only way to do it.
[23:56:03] <Arimil> so I was uploading the image to an iframe and echoing the filename however it seems I can't actually retrieve that filename in any way
[23:56:21] <nights``> $('#myModal').modal('show');
[23:56:25] <nights``> this line fails for me in IE8
[23:56:30] <nights``> anyone know whats up?
[23:56:38] <nights``> is modal.show() a better choice?
[23:57:00] <Flo0815> Arimil: why don't u use AJAX
[23:57:13] <Arimil> you can't submit a file using ajax
[23:57:34] <Arimil> since if you try to get the contents of a <input type="file"> all you can retrieve is the filename
[23:57:46] <Arimil> due to browser security
[23:58:08] <Arimil> so you need to submit the form somewhere without ajax
[23:58:12] <Arimil> so I submit it to an iframe
[23:59:00] <Flo0815> u can send an url to the parent window
[23:59:48] <Flo0815> or check via ajax in ur parent window if the imageupload is finished (for example check for an entry in a database)
