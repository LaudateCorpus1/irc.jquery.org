[04:07:57] <steelbull> Hi friends, somebody for small help?
[04:09:28] <steelbull> when I set change event on any item inside form, the browser showing mee confirmation window when Im leaving form
[04:10:00] <steelbull> I set change event with $('form :input').on('change', function() {...}
[04:10:13] <steelbull> and I gets the confirmation window
[04:11:24] <steelbull> what is interesting, when I set change event and on next line of my sourcecode unset it with  $('form :input').off(); I still get the browser confirmation window when I leave form

[04:13:13] <AdamPDotty> If you can not explain it properly try showing the problem -> jsfiddle.net!
[04:13:43] <steelbull> <AdamPDotty> ok

[05:44:13] <pax_rhos> hello, advise me some good jQuery REST client
[05:44:22] <pax_rhos> found this: https://github.com/jpillora/jquery.rest
[05:44:28] <pax_rhos> looks so-so
[05:44:32] <Cork> well you don't really need a rest client
[05:44:42] <Cork> if anything you need a rest url formater
[05:44:53] <Cork> cause the rest is just ajax
[05:45:10] <Cork> personally i just use $.ajax

[07:55:24] <xenaxon> hello all!
[07:55:27] <xenaxon> I
[07:55:41] <xenaxon> I've made an image panning script
[07:56:11] <xenaxon> with a container and an image inside it, and when you mousedown+drag it moves it from side to side.
[07:56:24] <xenaxon> but I am trying to achieve a 1 step better effect.
[07:57:12] <xenaxon> I want to allow it to move left/right even beyond the bounds of the image, so the user can move it in any direction creating white space on either side
[08:05:16] <stennowork> good day, i have a code https://jsfiddle.net/Lmgr83qa/ . Here i get an error Uncaught TypeError: e.indexOf is not a function . is that because i assign $ in an iife ?
[08:06:41] <Cork> stennowork: you can't give scroll without object to setTimeout
[08:07:05] <stennowork> i just want to trigger the "scroll" event
[08:07:24] <Cork> that isn't how you do that
[08:08:32] <Cork> stennowork: https://jsfiddle.net/Lmgr83qa/1/
[08:09:03] <stennowork> oh duh, thanks
[08:09:28] <stennowork> ok that makes sense
[08:09:31] <stennowork> sorry for the dumbness
[08:11:47] <stennowork> yep, works fine now, thanks
[08:12:59] <stennowork> .outerHeight in chrome really is a pita..
[08:36:04] <linurandy> hello to everyone, why when i load tabs then i ran $("#menu-entorno-activos").tabs({
[08:36:06] <linurandy>                                     load: function( event, ui ) {

[08:36:10] <linurandy>                                     }
[08:36:12] <linurandy>                                 }); and doesn't load again
[08:40:12] <linurandy> ("#menu-entorno-activos").tabs({

[08:45:50] <thykka> quick question, I have some HTML like this: <div><span>1</span>Lorem Ipsum</div> Can I extract only the "Lorem Ipsum" part somehow, without the "1"?
[08:46:30] <thykka> $('div').text() obviously gives "1Lorem Ipsum"..
[08:49:34] <thykka> I could probably .split() the div's .text() with the span's .text(), but that seems kinda hairy..
[08:50:25] <linurandy> thykka: why don't you use a div after span
[08:51:08] <thykka> i could do that, yes, but I'd rather not modify the html at this point
[08:52:52] <linurandy> hello to everyone, why when i load tabs then i ran $("#menu-entorno-activos").tabs({
[08:52:54] <linurandy>                                     load: function( event, ui ) {
[08:52:56] <linurandy>                                         ui.panel.load("activos/gpo_act/detail/{{ object.id }}");
[08:52:58] <linurandy>                                     }
[08:53:00] <linurandy>                                 }); and doesn't load again
[09:05:15] <Cork> linurandy: please use a jsfiddle instead of pasting multi line codes in the channel
[09:08:30] <stennowork> thykka, childNodes[0]
[09:08:46] <stennowork> thykka, childNodes[1]
[09:09:00] <Cork> stennowork: no, it isn't a node
[09:09:10] <stennowork> textNode surely is a node?
[09:09:11] <thykka> stennowork, thanks. There's no jQuery equivalent?
[09:09:22] <Cork> ah, damn ya sorry
[09:09:34] <Cork> thykka: jquery works with elements not nodes
[09:09:42] <Cork> so it doesn't see text
[09:10:02] <stennowork> $("foo").contents().get(1).nodeValue
[09:10:19] <Cork> thykka: the recommended way is to have a span or similarly wrap the text you want to be able to replace with scripts
[09:10:32] <Cork> else an extra line break or something like that can mess things up for you
[09:11:44] <thykka> stennowork, awesome, thanks!
[09:12:03] <stennowork> ah its .get(0)
[09:13:15] <stennowork> never mind there was a newline in my test code
[09:13:23] <thykka> yeah, .get(1) works for me
[09:14:11] <stennowork> ah lol that was exactly what Cork said
[14:17:27] <bigode> Hello folks!
[14:17:45] <taplar> salutations
[14:17:49] <bigode> What type of event fires when I call a animate() function?
[14:18:19] <taplar> i'm not sure that an event is fired
[14:20:13] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[14:22:08] <bigode> taplar: do you think it is possible to improve that position controller at left/top from this https://codepen.io/0rf30/pen/jrPGjQ
[14:23:02] <bigode> what I am trying is to update the text on taht span with the current .wrap div top position during a animate() function
[14:23:25] <taplar> hmm
[14:23:56] <taplar> yeah, so i could see a couple ways to do this
[14:24:24] <taplar> you could make a function that performs that update, and call it from the complete of each of the animates
[14:24:24] <taplar> so it happens after the animate is done
[14:24:55] <taplar> or to decouple it a little bit, could could throw a custom event some where and catch that, and then perform the logic.
[14:25:23] <taplar> either way, you want to wait until the animation is done before doing your numerical update most likely
[14:28:24] <taplar> also as a side note, you might could use a data attribute to reduce those bindings
[14:28:48] <bigode> taplar: I was guessing to use the build in eventListener scroll to update the span during animation
[14:29:12] <taplar> click would happen before the animation finishes most likely
[14:29:57] <bigode> yes, I just used click because scroll doesn't catches a fire
[14:30:31] <bigode> on the window OR div EventListener
[14:30:53] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/erJrKP?editors=1010
[14:35:14] <bigode> yes, definatly looks nicer.
[14:35:19] <bigode> Thank you.
[14:35:30] <taplar> sure thing
[14:35:33] <bigode> I was trying to see the numbers scroll as the div
[14:35:48] <taplar> aaaah
[14:36:13] <taplar> well, there are other options
[14:36:13] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:36:25] <taplar> you might try the progress or step callbacks
[14:36:31] <bigode> And I was waiting to refactor the code to avoid repetitions
[14:39:21] <taplar> if you refresh it i changed it to do it on the progress callback
[16:04:14] <taplar> bow chicka wow wow, watcha gonna say
[16:04:55] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:10:34] <Levin^> hello
[16:11:00] <taplar> bon'jour
[16:12:12] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zjrLbR?editors=1010
[16:12:18] <Levin^> instructions inside!
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:13:06] <robertmaxrees> okay so a couple questions here:
[16:13:07] <Levin^> what is wrong there?
[16:13:10] <Levin^> hm
[16:13:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just render the page the right way?
[16:13:30] <Levin^> I can't
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:13:41] <Levin^> it's a very long story
[16:13:49] <Levin^> very
[16:14:05] <robertmaxrees> you aren't trying to, like, get around click tracking or something, right?
[16:14:10] <Levin^> no
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> also: what's the core issue?
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> because i don't really see a problem statement in there.
[16:15:00] <Levin^> the way I'm using custom post types and custom page templates of wordpress won't allow me to add a dynamic link to a button
[16:15:09] <taplar> it's backwards
[16:15:15] <Levin^> so I decided on using jquery
[16:15:15] <robertmaxrees> also: var $trueLink = $button.find(".blue-buttom");
[16:15:19] <taplar> it's going from the button to the website
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> might wanna fix that classname
[16:15:30] <Levin^> oh
[16:16:16] <taplar> it also might be helpful if the variables reflected what they were.  $website, $blueButton
[16:16:22] <taplar> i keep having to glance back to figure out wtf they are
[16:17:13] <Levin^> thanks, it works now :D
[16:17:21] <Levin^> it was backwards and with a typo
[16:24:13] <Levin^> hmm
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:24:41] <Levin^> as a SEO concern, google can also think I'm doing something weird, depending on what my scripts are behaving?
[16:24:52] <robertmaxrees> it can.
[16:24:55] <Levin^> hm
[16:25:49] <Levin^> if I use google webmasters tool, will it warn me if there are issues with my scripts?
[16:26:02] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember.
[16:26:06] <Levin^> I see
[16:26:07] <robertmaxrees> but it can't see into the future.
[16:26:32] <robertmaxrees> so even if it didn't flag today, in the future it might.  or it might not.
[16:26:39] <robertmaxrees> but it's kind of weird to shift markup around like that using JS.
[16:26:53] <Levin^> I see
[16:28:44] <robertmaxrees> is there a tl;dr about why you can't just render this normally?
[16:32:32] <taplar> cuz javascript is kool and can do it all
[16:33:48] <Levin^> I'm using wordpress with ACF with CPT (custom page templates and also custom post types) and I simply didn't find a way to insert at the template, in the ACF button a dynamic link
[16:34:06] <Levin^> it's really hard to explain in few words
[16:34:17] <robertmaxrees> but you're already inserting the links >.>
[16:34:25] <robertmaxrees> like, how are they getting onto the page in the first place?
[16:34:35] <Levin^> using a very simple way
[16:34:59] <Levin^> -that- specific element won't accept the dynamic link
[16:35:24] <robertmaxrees> do you need it to just look different?
[16:36:26] <bigode> taplar: thank you so much!
[16:37:34] <bigode> taplar: do you have any source/book/or something to point me in the direction of jQuery learning by any chance?
[16:37:57] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[16:38:00] <robertmaxrees> try.jquery.com
[16:39:26] <bigode> robertmaxrees: thank you. checking..
[16:49:30] <taplar> what did i do?
[16:49:44] <taplar> the scroll thing?
[16:50:03] <taplar> animate!  animate
[16:53:58] <bigode> taplar: yeees!! \o/
[16:56:41] <taplar> yeah, i'd give learn.jquery.com a read.  but also api.jquery.com is a great reference after the fact.  like in your case you were trying to do something with animate().  the api will tell you all the options available to you for that method and others.
[16:57:22] <taplar> and if anything in it is confusing you can always check learn again, or pop in and ask if you are misunderstanding something over there.
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:57:45] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about the jquery api is once you get the basics down, the rest is pretty easy to grok.
[18:15:45] <z1haze> if using a fat arrow on jquery.click() what comes in the callback, is it event, element?
[18:16:11] <taplar> define 'in' it
[18:16:21] <taplar> the arguments?
[18:17:01] <z1haze> yeah, the parameters in the callback
[18:17:13] <taplar> they're the same
[18:17:31] <z1haze> normally i just use event, and then `this`
[18:17:43] <z1haze> but with fat arrow this doesnt match so how do i get the element
[18:17:50] <taplar> event is still available.
[18:18:01] <z1haze> so its event.target?
[18:18:03] <taplar> (e) => e.target
[18:18:14] <z1haze> ah, see i thought the element came through as one of the params
[18:18:15] <z1haze> thanks
[18:18:21] <taplar> or e.currentTarget, depending
[18:19:29] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[18:19:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ z1haze this should come in handy.
[18:35:33] <z1haze> if i have an event on an anchor, but there's a span in there, its messing up my $(this).find() because it should be going from the anchor itself, but its searchign from the span instead.. anyway to make (this) always be the anchor?
[18:35:47] <z1haze> thats currentTarget isnt it
[18:36:27] <taplar> i believe that is accurate
[18:37:10] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget
[18:37:13] <z1haze> i really never knew the differences in those til now
[18:37:50] <z1haze> nice
[20:26:13] <z1haze> can you bind multiple selectors if they are already jquery objects?
[20:26:49] <z1haze> like $('.my-class, #some-id').click... but lets say I already have #some-id in a jquery object
