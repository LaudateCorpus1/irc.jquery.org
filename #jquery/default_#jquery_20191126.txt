[04:48:44] <Sal> hi
[04:50:07] <Sal> is there a way to underline characters of text while typing in a search box and then restore it all like it was if i cancel search?
[04:50:52] <Sal> i tried searching and adding tags around result, but it gets tricky when i have to restore text
[04:51:42] <Sal> never mind, i'll play with it a little bit more. If nothing comes up, i'll be back
[04:51:51] <Sal> thanks the same
[05:07:25] <Cork> you can't style input fields content
[08:40:19] <sioux_> hi guys! i'm trying clone template. Works fine, but when try set id in tr, this doesnt set. if i set id in td, set fines. https://jsbin.com/hopudojazi/edit?html,js,output
[08:46:46] <Cork> so your trying to set an id on <tr class="tr"> ?
[08:48:14] <sioux_> Cork, yes
[08:48:32] <Cork> try .filter() insterad of .find()
[08:49:11] <Cork> (also you want to use $($.parseHTML($('#template_guests').html())) instead of $($('#template_guests').html()))
[08:49:40] <sioux_> Cork, works with filter man
[08:49:49] <sioux_> Thank's alot ;)
[08:50:01] <Cork> sioux_: you don't have a parent element to tr in the template
[08:50:06] <Cork> so you can't find it from a parent
[08:50:11] <Cork> hence why you want .filter()
[08:50:30] <Cork> you could just do instance.attr('id', '') too
[08:50:30] <sioux_> why in another elments, like <td> in can set id with find?
[08:50:39] <Cork> cause it isn't the outer moste element
[08:50:56] <Cork> dom is a tree and find looks for children
[08:51:05] <Cork> filter filters the list in jquery
[08:51:25] <sioux_> hmm, good information
[08:51:31] <sioux_> ;)
[08:51:40] <Cork> tr is the element your holding on to, so you can't find it as a child :)
[11:36:09] <robertparkerx> how can I prevent change keyup from submit twice?
[11:37:27] <robertparkerx> https://gist.github.com/robertparkerx/bab62f011acddcec4a2070e4e5d0285e
[11:59:11] <bestdesign> robertparkerx: you mean prevent submission?
[12:04:34] <robertmaxrees> oof.  generating JS using PHP.
[12:04:58] <robertparkerx> https://gist.github.com/robertparkerx/bab62f011acddcec4a2070e4e5d0285e
[12:05:05] <robertparkerx> This is what I got but it adds three
[12:05:23] <thykka> php has a v8 engine :)
[12:05:29] <thykka> https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.v8js.php
[12:05:38] <robertmaxrees> thykka that's not what's happening here heh.
[12:06:07] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx your question is still vague.  mind rephrasing?
[12:07:32] <thykka> oof. checking capabilities via useragent regex
[12:08:14] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx you've beeen asking a lot of questions lately - have you considered running through a tutorial/guide on jquery to get up to speed?
[12:08:31] <robertmaxrees> investing a little more time up front will pay off in spades down the road.
[12:08:58] <robertparkerx> When I change numbers in the input, it's supposed to submit ajax and it does but if I change it to 1 and that's all, it will add three
[12:09:41] <robertmaxrees> have you tried to maek a test case?
[12:10:27] <robertmaxrees> even better, have you tried using your browser's debugger to watch what's happening?
[12:10:57] <robertparkerx> I'm going to invest more time in learning jQuery better
[12:14:54] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  you should check out https://learn.jquery.com/ :)
[12:22:54] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/4Lovfcdn/ well it's not doing it here
[12:23:59] <bestdesign> robertparkerx: what you want exactly?
[12:24:23] <robertparkerx> just for it to change once
[12:25:12] <bestdesign> change once what part exactly?
[12:25:30] <robertparkerx> the input
[12:25:38] <robertparkerx> you'll see in console log it does
[12:27:40] <robertparkerx> I found the problem
[12:28:10] <bestdesign> what was?
[12:28:26] <robertparkerx> I had the script included three times from a foreach loop
[12:28:27] <robertparkerx> lol
[12:31:08] <bestdesign> robertparkerx: the .attr style is means css style?
[12:32:33] <robertparkerx> yes I think so
[12:33:27] <bestdesign> robertparkerx: that is not a correct way to do it
[12:33:56] <bestdesign> robertparkerx: the .attr tag is not for set css style for that have .css('display', 'none'); for example
[12:34:08] <bestdesign> is the correct way
[12:38:07] <bestdesign> robertparkerx:
[12:38:08] <bestdesign> This may work, but has some problems:
[12:38:11] <bestdesign> It is preferred to change style property instead of style attribute.
[12:38:13] <bestdesign> It will replace all previously set inline styles.
[12:38:15] <bestdesign> Then, if you use jQuery, better use css method:
[12:43:53] <robertparkerx> I'll start to use it instead
[12:44:20] <robertparkerx> Thank you for explaining
[12:54:01] <bestdesign> robertparkerx:
[12:54:04] <bestdesign> Using css() also allows you to set multiple style attributes while keeping your code readable:
[12:54:06] <bestdesign> $('.element').css({
[12:54:08] <bestdesign>     color: red,
[12:54:10] <bestdesign>     textDecoration: 'underline',
[12:54:12] <bestdesign>     // etc.
[12:54:14] <bestdesign> })
[12:54:29] <robertmaxrees> just use addClass and removeClass and keep your css separate
