[03:17:01] <naftilos76> Hi, i am doing $("#some_id").val("some_val"); while the text field is setup with el.on("input", function(){}); Shouldn't the input event be fired?
[03:18:39] <thykka> no
[03:19:41] <naftilos76> thykka: what am i missing here?
[03:19:44] <thykka> https://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[03:21:48] <naftilos76> thanks
[03:32:32] <Cork> might be worth mentioning, javascript doesn't trigger events; events are for getting information that the user did something
[03:32:51] <Cork> (and in some cases about css doing something)
[06:10:32] <crs> Cork: Hi. :)
[09:33:28] <weijunli> I have a div that wraps alot of img tags, how can I send the content of that div (the images) to a remote server?
[09:38:34] <Cork> weijunli: you mean the urls or the actual image data?
[09:46:25] <weijunli> the image itself
[09:46:32] <weijunli> Cork,
[09:53:47] <Cork> weijunli: then you can do it to some degree with the help of canvas
[09:54:02] <Cork> but depending on where it is from it might block you
[09:54:53] <Cork> images from other domains is blocked unless the server allows it if i remember correctly, to not leak user data to random sites
[09:58:51] <weijunli> it is from file:/// to my server
[09:58:56] <weijunli> so i can allow CORS *
[10:02:12] <Cork> you can't allow cors for file:// urls
[10:02:31] <Cork> you can use <input type="file">
[10:02:45] <Cork> and use its files object to create a formData object
[10:03:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[10:03:12] <Cork> then you can give that to a normal ajax call and upload the files
[10:08:59] <weijunli> well the input option is not what Im looking for, as I am loading a bunch of  images dynamically
[10:09:22] <Cork> well a webpage can't load random file:// urls
[10:09:43] <Cork> it falls in the same "leak user data"
[10:09:57] <weijunli> what you mean load random file:// ?
[10:10:15] <Cork> you can give a file:// url to an img tag and it will display it
[10:10:26] <Cork> but the page (js) can't get access to that resource
[10:10:50] <Cork> cause if that was possible the site could just do send file;///etc/passwords
[10:10:57] <Cork> and... that would be less then good
[10:11:20] <Cork> so to get access; as in can send it to places you need file objects
[10:11:32] <weijunli> I guess you are missing a point
[10:11:41] <Cork> and only input can give you that (except for you can use fileWrite to generate it from data you have in the page)
[10:11:46] <weijunli> the html file is also on file:///, that html file will have the js to send to my server
[10:11:57] <Cork> doesn't change it
[10:12:06] <Cork> you want to send the data to a place that isn't file://
[10:15:02] <weijunli> :/, what other workaround I have
[10:17:38] <Cork> you could use file drop events in the page and use FileReader on the event target
[10:17:47] <Cork> but again, you can't use file:// as a source; ever
[10:18:23] <Cork> file:// is highely restricted in what it can do, as it doens't have the normal security isolation from the users data
[10:19:01] <Cork> (and why it is normally better to not use file:// and run a micro web server instead)
[10:19:47] <weijunli> i want to send my images to my server, i cant see any other way without having file:// as source
[10:20:14] <weijunli> what about content://
[10:20:24] <weijunli> as img srcs
[10:20:24] <Cork> you can use something like electron to extend the page access to have file access
[10:20:35] <Cork> but in a browser, you can't go that route
[10:20:52] <Cork> your option is d&d and <input type="file"> nothing else
[10:24:27] <weijunli> im definitely not interested in using input, it really makes no sense to have a page where i need to select everything..
[10:24:35] <weijunli> not familiar with electron, but why wouldnt it work on web
[10:27:20] <weijunli> if the img srcs are from content://, does it change anything?
[11:26:52] <thykka> why not run a server? it's ridiculously easy these days
[11:27:04] <thykka> $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[11:27:08] <thykka> and that's it
[11:28:08] <thykka> s/it's/it can be
[11:30:51] <weijunli> thykka, ?
[11:31:09] <weijunli> is this related to my issuue
[11:31:12] <thykka> yess
[11:31:20] <thykka> if you want http instead of file urls
[11:31:34] <thykka> (which you do)
[11:32:33] <thykka> every time someone uses a file:/// url, Linus Torvalds loses a hair..
[11:32:45] <thykka> so don't do that, we don't need a bald Torvalds
[11:33:38] <weijunli> im loading a html file on android, which is stored on file:///
[11:33:52] <weijunli> that html file is supposed to send the imgs to a server
[11:36:02] <thykka> are you using a framework of some kind?
[11:37:27] <weijunli> no
[11:38:00] <thykka> so essentially, you just have a .html file which you're loading in the phone's browser?
[11:38:22] <weijunli> yes
[11:38:39] <thykka> eww, well, good luck with that :D
[11:38:57] <thykka> I'd just host the html file somewhere..
[12:11:28] <albin> Object doesn't support Object or Property 'block' - getting this error in ie/edge but in chrome getting alert undefined error...any suggestions/fix..please let me know...thanks
[12:40:51] <nicod_> hello, just noticed https://download.jqueryui.com/download is down (error 502 bad gateway on cloudflare cdn)
[12:42:26] <robertmaxrees> nicod_ you'll want to let #jquery-dev know
[12:42:37] <nicod_> ok, thanx
[12:42:48] <robertmaxrees> although
[12:42:58] <robertmaxrees> where'd you get that link?
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> aaah the theme builder.
[12:43:19] <nicod_> yes, exactly
[12:44:47] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues looks like it's already been reported.
[12:45:01] <robertmaxrees> been dead for a while.
[12:45:29] <nicod_> ok, thank you
[12:46:37] <nicod_> oh, and there's an alternative server that'll do the job https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/371
[12:47:25] <robertmaxrees> just be aware that's not an official one.
[12:47:43] <nicod_> yes, of course
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> you can also handle the theming yourself :)
[12:47:57] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask - why use jquery ui?
[12:48:27] <nicod_> for sortable in a widget
[12:48:43] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:49:07] <robertmaxrees> like, a drag and drop list kind of thing?
[12:49:17] <robertmaxrees> seems overkill to bring in jquery ui for that one req.
[12:49:29] <nicod_> yes, to sort items in a list
[12:49:48] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/retrofuturistic/pen/tlbHE
[12:49:52] <nicod_> overkill maybe, but quick and easy
[12:49:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:50:21] <nicod_> eh, not bad ! :)
[12:50:37] <nicod_> pure vanilla
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> quick google search :)
[13:00:50] <nicod_> you're right, i dont need 60KB minified for this simple thing
[13:01:17] <nicod_> i was lazy, thx for the motivation
[14:01:03] <deepo> Hi!
[14:01:32] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[14:01:39] <deepo> I need help with a small jquery problem involving .change() function on a selectmenu. Can anybody help?
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question - if somebody can help, they will :)
[14:03:08] <deepo> I have a selectmenu with two options in it. If I add a .change() function to pick up the selected entry, then it updates the display with the selected value a few seconds later, and not immidiately
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> can you show us the code in a fiddle?
[14:03:42] <deepo> moment please
[14:07:19] <robertmaxrees> please don't PM me :)
[14:08:02] <robertmaxrees> deepo keep it in channel please.
[14:08:36] <deepo> Sorry, I can't get the jsfiddle to work, so forget it
[14:08:45] <robertmaxrees> that'sfine - show me what you have so far.
[14:10:24] <deepo> http://playground.beltoft.dk/
[14:10:37] <robertmaxrees> nono - just the relevant code :|
[14:10:44] <robertmaxrees> not your entire site.
[14:11:21] <deepo> I need time to prepare a jsfiddle then
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> you can just put the JS in - doesn't have to function necessarily.
[14:15:38] <deepo> https://jsfiddle.net/deepo/he8tay9n/
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> that's... hundreds of lines of code.
[14:16:10] <deepo> On the front page I have a single selecemenu called hitchhiker
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> can you reduce it down to just the relvant bits?
[14:16:33] <deepo> no, not easily
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> :/
[14:16:39] <deepo> I'm not used to jsfiddles
[14:17:33] <deepo> javascript line 300 is the .change() function
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> what's with the timeout?
[14:18:47] <deepo> I was trying out if that helped
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> helped whtat?
[14:18:56] <robertmaxrees> *what
[14:18:58] <deepo> I guess there is no nee for it
[14:19:08] <deepo> with the missing screen update
[14:21:04] <robertmaxrees> is the issue that, when you make a selection, something else isn't updating correctly?
[14:22:02] <deepo> no - the select is not updating
[14:22:14] <robertmaxrees> what should update the select then?
[14:22:39] <deepo> If I select option B it displays option A - and then shifts to B a few seconds later
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> well yeah, there's an ajax call in play here.
[14:23:24] <deepo> selecting an option should reflect that and fetch data for the combination of value of select and the chosen date
[14:23:45] <deepo> yes, but that should be async, right?
[14:24:25] <deepo> that's why i introduced the setTimeout()
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> you're resetting a bunch of things on change.
[14:25:00] <deepo> yes - the fields below the selectmenu
[14:25:10] <deepo> not the selectmenu value
[14:26:37] <robertmaxrees> add a console log or a breakpoint in loadHitchhikers - see if that's getting called when it shouldn't.
[14:28:22] <deepo> No it's only called at load of page, not when selecting a new option
[14:28:29] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[14:28:54] <deepo> yes, just tested in on the live version using Chrome
[14:29:14] <deepo> the jsfiddle is not working due to missing files and PHP scripts
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing a bunch of calls to selectmenu('refresh', true) peppered into your code.
[14:29:36] <robertmaxrees> it'd see which of those is getting hit.
[14:29:48] <deepo> jes, that's to update the selectmenu
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> something is obviously refreshing the select on change.
[14:30:16] <robertmaxrees> which "resets" the default value.
[14:30:45] <deepo> but only one of them relates to this selectmenu in question
[14:30:59] <robertmaxrees> i see three.
[14:31:06] <robertmaxrees> one is commented out.
[14:31:20] <deepo> it's in loadHitchhikers() twice, which is not getting called after page load
[14:31:32] <deepo> yes - and?
[14:31:39] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: just giving you ideas to look into.
[14:31:49] <deepo> ok
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - don't prepend selectors with tagnames.  instead of select#hitchhiker, just do #hitchhiker
[14:33:36] <deepo> is it faster? It's not easier to read without the prepended stuff... ;)
[14:33:46] <robertmaxrees> it's absolutely easier to read.
[14:33:52] <deepo> without?
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:34:13] <deepo> maybe you are more experienced than me :)
[14:34:18] <robertmaxrees> IDs and Classes should describe whatever it is sufficiently enough.
[14:34:39] <deepo> ok, so a longer id or class descriptor?
[14:34:51] <robertmaxrees> if that helps you, yeah.
[14:35:57] <robertmaxrees> if i were you, i'd set a breakpoint inside that update function and step through until you see the select reverts.
[14:36:21] <robertmaxrees> $('select#hitchhiker').off(); looks suspect, as well.
[14:37:12] <deepo> I had a problem on another jQuery Mobile app where a .change() function was added several times, that's why I use .off()
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:37:34] <robertmaxrees> take that out and use delegated handlers instead.
[14:37:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you were binding multiple times.
[14:37:53] <robertmaxrees> delegated handlers you can just setup and leave be.
[14:37:54] <deepo> can you point me to an example of that?
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:38:14] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:38:24] <robertmaxrees> make sure to actually read these - don't skip to just the examples.
[14:39:56] <deepo> ok, thanks - that'll be the evening read then
[14:40:17] <deepo> Instead of writing my own PHP scripts to create an API, what tools could I use? I don't necessarily need a database. Files are OK in many cases.
[14:40:36] <robertmaxrees> sec
[14:41:03] <deepo> I store JSON in flat files for a few of my projects
[14:41:28] <robertmaxrees> back
[14:41:39] <robertmaxrees> so that second question - could you elaborate?
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> why expose an API if they're just flat files?
[14:42:01] <deepo> I use filtering and such
[14:42:08] <deepo> sent in from the client
[14:42:11] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need server-side processing.
[14:42:24] <deepo> yes, that's what my PHP stuff does
[14:42:36] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the question? lol
[14:42:49] <deepo> What to use instead of manually coding PHP
[14:42:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to use some kind of server-side processing, so you'll have to expose an API to do that.
[14:43:12] <deepo> yes - what tools are next step up from manually coding PHP?
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> that's all pretty basic stuff - dunno what tools are available in PHP for that.
[14:43:31] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to start using a framework
[14:44:21] <deepo> well thanks for your time
[14:44:29] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth, everything will require some kind of manual development work.
[14:45:23] <deepo> Yeah, I was just hoping that there would be a framework that would create the API for me if I supplied the "layout"
[14:45:48] <robertmaxrees> graphql kind of does that.
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> but i don't think the overhead of integrating that would be worth it.
[15:50:27] <snackoverflow> can anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225797/two-segments-of-code-in-javascripts-canvas-that-are-nearly-identical-to-each
[15:50:56] <robertmaxrees> not seeing any jquery in there - i'd ask ##javascript.
[15:57:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, I see the .each() now - you're running that code multiple times per "psotion"
[16:50:23] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone, when i load a part of a page with the .load function, the css is ignored, how to overcome thi issue ??
[16:51:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:52:17] <rocketmagnet> i load a part of a page with .load and insert it into my document but the css is ignored
[16:56:19] <robertmaxrees> is the CSS included on the page you're interting to?
[16:56:29] <robertmaxrees> *inserting
[16:56:45] <rocketmagnet> my bad
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:56:56] <rocketmagnet> i used h2 instead of h1 ...
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> haha
[22:29:45] <TimRiker> Is there a way to get the default search input on datatables to do regex searches? ie: instead calling search(). Example: https://datatables.net/examples/api/regex.html
