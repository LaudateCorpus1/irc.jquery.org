[04:35:00] <Lebbe> hello guys. Im spelunking around with some DOM manipulations. I do a $(selector).clone().find(otherSelector).each(function() { $(this).parent().addClass('className') });
[04:35:31] <Lebbe> I save the result of clone() to a variable first, before I continue
[04:35:41] <Lebbe> but the new class-name isnt added
[04:35:51] <Lebbe> anyone can think of what is up?
[04:37:12] <Lebbe> it seems to be the combination of .clone() and .each()?
[04:41:10] <tiblock> Hi. I want to send messages between open tabs of my site, what is correct text request to google to find this kind of libs?
[04:56:49] <tiblock> oh well, will write my own
[04:57:07] <Ansikt> what's that special hidden attribute called which jQuery adds to every element?
[04:57:18] <tiblock> Ansikt, data?
[04:58:26] <tiblock> Ansikt, http://api.jquery.com/data/ maybe you want this maybe not
[04:58:38] <Ansikt> Nope.
[04:59:01] <Ansikt> jQuery adds a unique attribute to every Node which it binds events to.
[04:59:14] <Ansikt> There's a special name for it too, but I can't remember it.
[05:00:17] <shoky> Ansikt: maybe you mean expando
[05:00:39] <Ansikt> Yes!
[05:23:20] <Trudko> hi guys I am using jquery ajax for get request which is returning pdf file. How should I handle return value? If I use ajax I get pdf as part of  success callback parameter
[05:25:13] <arthurvr> depends.. What do you wanne do with that pdf?
[05:29:37] <arthurvr> Do you want to display that file on the screen? or provide the file as download?...
[05:46:49] <lilsammy> anyone know how to remove a file extension but keep it so I can insert somthing in where it was and put the file extension back?
[05:46:54] <lilsammy> from a string I mean
[05:47:45] <lilsammy> would need to support all image formats, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png so it wouldn't just be a case of trimming 4 charaters off the end type thing
[05:49:33] <Jattenalle> lilsammy, find the last . remove anything after it... or you can just keep it, and add whatever: file.jpeg.myfancyextension
[05:51:33] <arthurvr> lilsammy check out http://pastebin.com/ZmVALRDD
[05:52:27] <Jattenalle> just keep in mind that that approach will split files with multiple . into multiple results
[05:52:34] <Jattenalle> which is messy
[05:52:43] <lilsammy> Yeah I just mentioned that to someone in PM Jattenalle
[05:52:51] <lilsammy> like .com .co.uk
[05:53:22] <Jattenalle> well not really, since file extensions never contain a .
[05:53:30] <Jattenalle> but a file named: my.vacation.jpg
[05:53:44] <Jattenalle> would end up as: "my" and "jpg"
[05:53:48] <Jattenalle> with what arthurvr linked
[05:54:03] <lilsammy> yeah but it would mean selected the last item in the array it made?
[05:54:09] <lilsammy> selecting*
[05:54:18] <Jattenalle> better to just use string manipulation
[05:54:38] <Jattenalle> using arrays you need to loop over and concat the string again to get the full filename
[05:55:17] <lilsammy> Yeah well this will be used within another loop so trying to avoid too many loops here :D
[05:55:46] <Jattenalle> string.lastIndexOf() and string.substr(start, end)
[05:56:08] <lilsammy> thanks will test a couple things out :D
[05:56:14] <Jattenalle> var filename = whatever.substr(0, whatever.lastIndexOf('.'));
[05:56:17] <arthurvr> Jattenalle: indeed would work
[05:56:39] <Jattenalle> var ext = whatever.substr(whatever.lastIndxOf('.'));
[05:56:45] <Jattenalle> much simpler, no need for loops
[05:56:57] <arthurvr> For such a simple thing, avoid loops.
[05:56:58] <Jattenalle> you'll need a +1 or -1 somewhere in there to not also grab the . itself
[05:57:14] <lilsammy> thanks Jattenalla, was just about to mention the dot
[05:57:59] <arthurvr> wondering if that would work with dotfiles (like .htaccess, or .gitignore)
[05:58:15] <Jattenalle> it will, though it will return the filename as ''
[05:58:19] <shoky> js> 'my.vacation.jpg'.replace(/\.(\w*)$/, '.newshit.$1')
[05:58:20] <Jattenalle> and the ext as '.htaccess'
[05:58:30] <shoky> stupid b-ot
[05:58:32] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[05:58:37] <Jattenalle> shoky, overkill
[05:59:02] <shoky> sure. just giving another option
[05:59:08] <Jattenalle> :)
[05:59:44] <shoky> js> print( 'my.vacation.jpg'.replace(/\.(\w*)$/, '.newshit.$1') )
[05:59:49] <lilsammy> :D thanks for all the help guys gives me plenty to go on I think
[05:59:58] <b-ot> shoky: my.vacation.newshit.jpg
[06:00:31] <arthurvr> filename.split('.').pop(); for just getting extension
[06:00:44] <lilsammy> var ext = imgarray[i].substr(imgarray[i].lastIndexOf('.'));
[06:00:50] <lilsammy> that seems to include a dot
[06:00:56] <lilsammy> but I thought it wouldn't
[06:01:00] <lilsammy> but thats fine
[06:01:12] <Jattenalle> arthurvr, i think that's more expensive than simple string, since you let the GC clean up an array that you dnot care about
[06:01:12] <lilsammy> you spelled index wrong and I was like wait a minute that is a function lol
[06:01:28] <Jattenalle> lilsammy, like i said, you need to add -1
[06:01:39] <arthurvr> Jattenalle: I agree.
[06:01:55] <lilsammy> oh well I need the dot so thats fine :D
[06:02:18] <arthurvr> I'm writing jsperf tescase for this, want to now what's the best solution
[06:04:28] <lilsammy>  this is my final messy code lol http://pastebin.com/fRjfEk5a
[06:07:23] <arthurvr> finally checkout http://jsperf.com/getting-extensions
[06:08:18] <Jattenalle> booh ya!
[06:08:19] <Jattenalle> i win
[06:08:22] <Jattenalle> by a lot :P
[06:08:47] <lilsammy> Thats coool
[06:09:18] <lilsammy> thats really cool benchmarking will bookmark that :D
[06:09:45] <arthurvr> lilsammy: never used it?
[06:10:43] <lilsammy> no never used it arthurvr I actually try to avoid JS I am pretty old fashioned for hard coding things in PHP
[06:11:19] <arthurvr> never try to avoid javascript. Huggeee mistake
[06:14:25] <lilsammy> I know I just never used it until 3 - 4 years ago before that I would do everything in PHP so like 10 years of only using PHP
[06:15:10] <lilsammy> Nice to put the processing load client side but it does have some cons in my opinion
[06:15:40] <lilsammy> open code being one of them but I guess thats a small price to pay for the advantage of offloading the processing power of some things to the user.
[06:16:57] <lilsammy> anyway im off got a client meeting to prepare for ... fun times :(
[06:36:34] <delboy1978uk> how do i turn 1404687600 into a human readble date?
[06:48:12] <amsmith> i've got a problem, i want to change a wordpress menu to a responsive one, it works, but has some little bugs, for example the hover effect appear, even if it dont show up because of the used jquery code, the url is www2.tourismus.de, can anybody look over the code and tell me what the fault of this code is?
[06:49:53] <osa1> hi all. I'm including jquery using DOM manipulation: document.createElement("script"); .setAttribute("href", "jquery.min.js"); and in the next line I'm having `$(document).bind('ready', myFun);` but it fails with "$ is undefined". note that if I check $ in the console it works. any ideas what's going wrong?
[06:50:16] <osa1> note that I'm not forgetting to add that script tag to <head> in case you're wondering :)
[06:54:34] <Suppa|Werk> hi
[06:55:03] <Suppa|Werk> I'm trying to make an ajax request to another domain, but I can't get the other domain/server to respond with jsonp, only json
[06:55:18] <Suppa|Werk> and I'm getting unexpected token when I try to read the data (datatype is jsonp too)
[06:55:23] <Suppa|Werk> is there any workaround this?
[06:57:08] <shoky> Suppa|Werk: the server needs to support jsonp. another better way is using CORS, but the server still needs to support it
[06:57:31] <Suppa|Werk> hmm
[06:59:38] <Suppa|Werk> shoky: so it's impossible to read the json as jsonp?
[06:59:54] <shoky> it's impossible if the server doesn't specifically enable it, yes
[07:02:33] <BillCriswell> Suppa|Werk: If you have a server side language ot work with you can proxy through that.
[07:03:40] <Suppa|Werk> BillCriswell: yes, I can make a PHP script
[07:03:57] <Suppa|Werk> BillCriswell: should I curl the URL inside the script and then echo the result?
[07:05:33] <BillCriswell> Suppa|Werk: That can work. I've done things like: header("Content-Type: application/json"); echo file_get_contents($url);
[07:06:50] <Suppa|Werk> BillCriswell: nice, that sounds easier, thanks!
[07:13:29] <delboy1978uk> hi got disconnected, did anyone reply ?
[07:19:27] <delboy1978uk> quiet in here today
[07:19:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah... a little too quiet.
[07:19:51] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfMrVKnGzwg I'm watching this.
[07:20:00] <delboy1978uk> its eerie!
[07:20:20] <BillCriswell> I hope I was cooler than these kids.
[07:20:31] <delboy1978uk> can whitespace ruin parseInt?
[07:20:34] <dglambert> HEY
[07:20:38] <dglambert> opps, lol Hey
[07:20:39] <delboy1978uk> cant watch just now boss walked in lol
[07:22:07] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: Doesn't seem so.
[07:22:29] <BillCriswell> Just tried parseInt(' 3 ') and it gave me 3
[07:23:46] <delboy1978uk> i do this: d.setUTCDate(parseInt(row.date)); the date is 1221990258 . then i do this: li += row.name+'</strong> on '+d.getDay()+'/'+ d.getMonth()+'/'+ d.getYear()+' '+'<br />' + stars;
[07:24:40] <delboy1978uk> output: Billybob on NaN/NaN/NaN
[07:25:18] <NoiseEee> delboy1978uk: / isn't a number.
[07:25:21] <NoiseEee> nor is <br>
[07:29:42] <delboy1978uk> i'm not trying to add that! i'm trying to build a string! d.getDay() should give a number, yeah?
[07:29:50] <shoky> delboy1978uk: setUTCDate is for setting the day-in-month.  you probably want:  new Date(parseInt(row.date,10) * 1000)
[07:30:08] <delboy1978uk> ah
[07:30:14] <delboy1978uk> cheers, let me try that
[07:31:52] <shoky> delboy1978uk: and probably you want .getDate() instead of .getDay()
[07:32:17] <ghostlines> hi, if I change something in the dom does $(document).ready() fire again?
[07:32:22] <shoky> no
[07:32:31] <ghostlines> ahh k thanks
[07:33:39] <delboy1978uk> shoky: using your first suggestion i get  Billybob on 1/11/108
[07:33:52] <delboy1978uk> closer! will try the getDate() part now
[07:34:14] <shoky> delboy1978uk: yea and add 1900 to the year
[07:35:49] <shoky> oh there's .getFullYear() too
[07:36:04] <delboy1978uk> shoky, you da man. cheers
[07:36:16] <shoky> also add 1 to the month ;p
[07:37:39] <bengalo> hey guys, i want to retrieve information from an external website via ajax. basically read the page's html, parse it with jquery and filter out the stuff i need. this used to work very well but 2 days ago it started that every now or then the ajax errors with a cors error. (which it didnt before)... is there a reason why this wouldnt trigger everytime that i have influence on or is there a way
[07:37:39] <bengalo> around this?
[07:38:19] <bengalo> i have no access to the external website, so the allow thingie is not an option
[07:38:42] <delboy1978uk> yeah just noticed the month, why all these stupid workarounds lol?
[07:40:00] <delboy1978uk> so like this then:-P getDate()+'/'+ (d.getMonth() + 1)+'/'+ d.getFullYear()
[07:58:49] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: If you'll be doing more than like.. 2 things with a date I'd just use moment.
[07:58:59] <fabio_> how to test if a element exists?
[07:59:31] <bengalo> $('#yourelement').length > 0
[07:59:33] <BillCriswell> fabio_: Check the length.
[08:00:18] <fabio_> Im trting this BillCriswell
[08:00:19] <fabio_> if(($('input[name=pwr]').lenght > 0) && ($('input[name=pwr]').val() != $('input[name=pw]').val()))
[08:00:44] <fabio_> if the input pwr exists and pwr is equal to pw
[08:01:07] <fabio_> the thing is is not doing the test
[08:01:32] <BillCriswell> fabio_: That looks like it should work. Must be something else going on.
[08:03:40] <BillCriswell> fabio_: http://jsbin.com/mafifepo/1/edit?html,js,output quick demo.
[08:05:00] <shoky> fabio_: donno if thats your actual code, but you got a typo  .lenght
[08:05:55] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ha.
[08:06:13] <BillCriswell> I always catch myself do that, never someone else.
[08:07:00] <shoky> well that's more useful ;p
[08:07:33] <BillCriswell> Haha true
[08:08:00] <BillCriswell> shoky: I built a small plugin using the widget factory. I love that shit.
[08:10:10] <fabio_> BillCriswell, -_- yeah.... shit
[08:10:33] <BillCriswell> fabio_: shoky pointed out your issue. Should take care of it.
[08:10:55] <fabio_> BillCriswell, the funny thing is console not showed any err
[08:11:41] <BillCriswell> undefined > 0 => false
[08:13:40] <nicetry> Hey guys, a long time ago (year or two) everyone said '.each2 (http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#each2) is way way better/faster/stronger than natural .each' -- is that still the case?
[08:17:13] <BillCriswell> nicetry: More than likely.
[08:19:47] <Prometheian> Anyone know a way to make IE8 play nice with :not[colspan]?
[08:20:56] <arthurvr> What do you mean with :not[colspan], do you mean the css selector? Or jQuery? If you mean jQuery, make sure you are using 1.x
[08:21:46] <arthurvr>  As of jQuery 2.x, support for ie8 is gone
[08:22:08] <Prometheian> jQuery
[08:22:24] <arthurvr> What version of jQuery are u using?
[08:22:30] <shoky> isn't it  :not([colspan])
[08:22:41] <Prometheian> IE8 in its glorious bullshit retardation has decided that all columns are colspan=1 unless otherwise stated
[08:22:57] <Prometheian> I think find('td[colspan]:not([colspan=1])'); is working
[08:23:58] <Prometheian> jquery 1.7.2 I think
[08:24:03] <Prometheian> yeah
[08:24:23] <shoky> default colspan is 1 in any browser
[08:24:54] <Prometheian> But IE8 actually assumes that attr is there
[08:25:02] <Prometheian> Chrome and such know that it isn't listed
[08:25:19] * drej blinks
[08:25:24] <shoky> o
[08:25:38] <Prometheian> But IE8 thinks that it's listed
[08:30:57] <Prometheian> Yay IE8 + jQuery: accomplishmentSummary.find('td[colspan]:not([colspan=5])').parent().next().find('td[colspan=5]').parent().prev().after(addr);
[08:31:07] <Prometheian>  /wrist
[08:40:49] <damarusama> can I create an array of ALL the selected elements in a form - something like ('form').val()
[08:41:02] <damarusama> whene there is many mulitple select
[08:41:17] <robertmaxrees> you can serialize the form.
[08:41:27] <BillCriswell> Installing xcode is brutal.
[08:41:32] <BillCriswell> Feels like it's taken me hours.
[08:41:44] <robertmaxrees> damarusama http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/ is what you want
[08:42:02] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell yeah?  is xcode kind of like the apple equivalent to Visual Studio?
[08:42:10] <arthurvr> serialize() is not only selected elements
[08:42:24] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it'll serialize the form.
[08:42:32] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I guess haha. I kind of just need the iPhone simulator stuff... after this need to get the droid simulator stuff going.
[08:42:40] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell ooh fun.
[08:42:55] <damarusama> then I would need to parse th array and select only the element i want?
[08:43:19] <damarusama> so there is no way to 'wildcard' the .val()
[08:43:23] <damarusama> ?
[08:43:37] <BillCriswell> We spend so much time figuring out little issues on certain devices.
[08:43:45] <dmsuperman> damarusama: what do you mean
[08:43:46] <zeroquake> is there way to reorder divs -- when user enters search word - reorder matching divs
[08:43:51] <BillCriswell> The browser situation with droid is terrifying.
[08:44:05] <dmsuperman> damarusama: .serialize is what you want
[08:44:12] <dmsuperman> that fetches the values of all the form elements into a JSON object
[08:44:17] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: You can sort the arra of elements.
[08:44:21] <damarusama> ok will check into that
[08:44:23] <drej> BillCriswell i have been doing hybrid webapps lately, and androids webkit fragmentation is maddening
[08:44:34] <drej> so much so , that i actually package my own webkit with the app now
[08:44:54] <zeroquake> Bill - what keywords do i search for to know more on how to do it
[08:45:00] <damarusama> hey drej
[08:45:03] <drej> sup
[08:45:10] <robertmaxrees> .serialize() converts the form to a string -> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:45:21] <BillCriswell> drej: That sounds pretty nice.
[08:45:48] <drej> BillCriswell yeah it was actually really really beneficial, we support like 20 or so flavours of android
[08:45:48] <zeroquake> i want to show matching elements -- i dont think sort is what i want to do
[08:45:50] <drej> and this was a godsend
[08:45:55] <drej> levelled the playing field entirely
[08:46:25] <BillCriswell> drej: So it is like a phonegap type deal or something else entirely? The term hybrid app confuses me a bit..
[08:46:26] <robertmaxrees> drej what about the blink vs webkit landscape - what was your experience there?
[08:46:38] <drej> BillCriswell yeah phonegap
[08:46:47] <drej> well, cordova, not so much phonegap
[08:47:09] <drej> hybrid webapp == html/css/js wrapped in a native app webview
[08:47:16] <drej> with api hooks to device things like camera
[08:47:31] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: so when you say "reorder" what you actually mean is "filter"?
[08:47:51] <drej> robertmaxrees what about blink vs webkit? :)
[08:48:11] <drej> blink is only relevant on NEXUS android devices so far
[08:48:16] <zeroquake> you have  favourites list of 10 objects in an aray -- u makes divs of each objecy and display
[08:48:23] <BillCriswell> drej: Nice.
[08:48:47] <zeroquake> i want to add a search functionality - when i type in say "ab" , all favorites with ab in them brought to the top
[08:49:02] <zeroquake> or matching divs are show rest are hidden
[08:49:03] <robertmaxrees> drej not necessarily - i have chrom on a non-nexus device.
[08:49:17] <drej> chrome != blink necessarily
[08:49:21] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[08:49:25] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: then you want to sort.
[08:49:36] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: wait, make up your mind
[08:49:45] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: you're talking about 2 different things
[08:49:48] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake do you want to hide things that don't match, or sort things that match to the top
[08:49:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[08:50:23] <zeroquake> hide things that dont match is more appropriate i guess
[08:51:55] <robertmaxrees> then use a filter to find the things that don't have what you want in your collection and .hide() them while running .show() on the ones that do.  or create an object with keys that correspond back to the containers and values that are the things you want to search and go from there
[08:52:00] <robertmaxrees> few different ways to approach it.
[08:52:50] <zeroquake> any known tutorials?
[08:54:39] <robertmaxrees> not that I know of, but the basic idea shouldn't be too difficult.
[08:55:17] <Litmus> 'lo
[08:55:44] <Litmus> If preventDefault() also includes stopPropogation(), isn't it repetitive to have  both?
[08:56:13] <zeroquake> yup , i am going to search thru object array -- build the html push it into new container , display this  , hide the previous one -- that should be better than adding class or using lots of jquery selectors right?
[08:56:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.preventDefault <- "Cancels the event if it is cancelable, without stopping further propagation of the event."
[08:57:26] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: building the HTML from scratch each time would be worse performance than just hiding matching elements but it's up to you
[08:57:43] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake i wouldn't go that far. don't build anything new - just have the keys on the object correspond with the IDs on the containers.  search the object for keys that have matching text - for those that don't match, .hide().  for those that do, .show()
[08:58:12] <robertmaxrees> searching through that object is nice because you don't have to run through the expensive operation of searching through the dom.
[08:58:32] <robertmaxrees> Litmus did you see the link I posted?
[08:59:17] <zeroquake> oh , so adding a div to dom is expensive than - using 10 or 20 selectors plus doing .hide kinda operations?
[08:59:42] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake where are you getting "10 or 20 selectors" from?
[09:00:41] <dmsuperman> here's a DOM-based solution: http://jsbin.com/pehenuto/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:00:55] <Litmus> robertmaxrees: Ah, so it *doesn't*
[09:00:56] <zeroquake> so i search my list -- get the ids i need to display -- lets assume i have 20 favourites displayed --- based on search keyword - i need to hide 10 , i know the list of ids i need to hide , so i use $() to find each of these do a .hide on them
[09:01:00] <robertmaxrees> Litmus correct.
[09:01:19] <dmsuperman> zeroquake: an ID selector isn't heavy performance wise
[09:01:21] <asymo> can someone please tell me why the Show/Hide text does not change the second time? It's soo weird : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ecvkf
[09:01:31] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake and run .show() on those that DO match.
[09:01:45] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman's idea illustrates the basic point.
[09:02:02] <damarusama> what would be the simplest way to append array if they aren't empty
[09:02:03] <zeroquake> but i have a monumental number of nodes in my page -- its a pretty complex application
[09:02:17] <dmsuperman> then the object solution will be better
[09:02:18] <robertmaxrees> damarusama .push()
[09:02:27] <damarusama> thanks
[09:02:32] <dmsuperman> and at most you'll be making n monumental ID lookups which still aren't bad
[09:02:39] <zeroquake> does each id selector go thru entire dom ?
[09:02:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:02:48] <robertmaxrees> they go directly to that element.
[09:03:07] <zeroquake> oh ok so only for class selectors , they parse thru whole document?
[09:03:10] <dmsuperman> asymo: because why would "hide" evaluate to false at any point?
[09:03:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:03:13] <dmsuperman> asymo: it's a string
[09:03:26] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake class selectors are the second most efficient generally.
[09:03:45] <zeroquake> how does it know what to get without parsing the document ? do they have an index or smthing when the dom gets built
[09:03:59] <dmsuperman> DOM api zeroquake
[09:04:00] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake the browser API has all that information already.
[09:04:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery taps into the native DOM apis when it can.
[09:04:22] <dmsuperman> $('#id') = document.getElementById('id')
[09:04:25] <dmsuperman> which is fast
[09:04:28] <robertmaxrees> not exactly, but similar, yeah.
[09:04:43] <dmsuperman> it uses css selector API?
[09:04:49] <zeroquake> one last questions  so , even 1000 selectors operations are better than appending one div into dom ?
[09:05:03] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake adding/removing from the DOM is extremely expensive.
[09:05:04] <dmsuperman> no but how is that a valid comparison for your project?
[09:05:20] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman under the hood, but the jquery function adds overhead.
[09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> sizzle does use document.getElementById() when it can, though.
[09:05:46] <zeroquake> ok ,hmm  nevah knew that. thank you.
[09:06:05] <robertmaxrees> just don't do things like $('div#myId') <- the "div" part can slow you down.
[09:06:14] <robertmaxrees> but that's not the fault of jquery.
[09:06:38] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake iirc learn.jquery.com has a good primer on selectors and performance.
[09:06:49] <robertmaxrees> nction adds overhead.
[09:06:49] <robertmaxrees> [2014:08:07:09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> sizzle does use document.getElementById() when
[09:06:51] <dmsuperman> asymo: I think you mean "text = text == hide ? show : hide;"
[09:06:59] <robertmaxrees> woops learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[09:08:01] <zeroquake> thank you :)
[09:08:39] <robertmaxrees> adding/removing things can very expensive - minimizing those operations is always a Good Idea™
[09:09:22] <zeroquake> yup, i think i have good idea on what i have to do now
[09:09:36] <robertmaxrees> rad
[09:10:35] <asymo> dmsuperman,thx
[09:11:00] <mooncup> 21
[09:11:07] <robertmaxrees> 12
[09:11:12] <mooncup> oops sorry
[09:11:15] <mooncup> missed a /
[09:11:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:14:25] <zechariah> any good channel for jquery datatables / when paginating, rather then clearing the previous result, it appends the returned paginated records
[09:15:06] <robertmaxrees> you might find somebody that knows something here, zechariah, but i wouldn't count on it.  their forums might be a good place, though!
[09:15:29] <zechariah> yeah, i was about to break down and head over that way ;)
[09:15:49] <Litmus> isn't .on('dragenter') supposed to work firefox?
[09:17:05] <robertmaxrees> looks like it, Litmus -> http://caniuse.com/#search=drag
[09:28:41] <Litmus> When I obtain the files from OriginalEvent.dataTransfer.files.... is there a way to put that into a <input type="file"> ?
[09:30:08] <Litmus> .val() didn't work
[09:30:25] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16927195/javascript-datatransfer-and-input-type-file-issue - looks like you can't do that,.
[09:31:44] <damarusama> I decided to use a global object for my project as I have to create dynamically new dom elements which will contains array. Is there a simple way to concatenate all the array from one object?
[09:31:47] <Litmus> robertmaxrees: thank you
[09:32:04] <robertmaxrees> damarusama huh?
[09:32:44] <damarusama> if an object has multiple array - can I iterate trough all the array of that object and create 1 big array?
[09:33:06] <robertmaxrees> sure, though I'm not sure why you'd do that.
[09:33:27] <damarusama> because I am not sure how many array there will be in that object
[09:33:36] <robertmaxrees> why create the other array?
[09:33:56] <damarusama> the user can add element dynamically to a form - and these element are transformed to array
[09:33:59] <Litmus> robertmaxrees: wow it's not possible!
[09:34:02] <Litmus> that's a first in programming
[09:34:24] <robertmaxrees> Litmus might be an oversight or a security thing.
[09:34:37] <Litmus> Oh I see
[09:35:16] <robertmaxrees> damarusama can you create a jsbin and show what you're trying to do?
[09:35:46] <damarusama> it's a huge mess at this point - I'll try to post something shortly
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> damarusama i'm just confused about what you're trying to do and i get the feeling that you might be overcomplicating it.
[09:36:29] <damarusama> definitly feels like that
[09:46:15] <dagerik> gde33: i tried with jsonp: http://bpaste.net/show/572638/ did not work
[09:46:17] <dagerik> how can i do multiple HTTP POST towards a different origin? i dont care about the return HTML but the cookies must be passed along.
[09:46:44] <robertmaxrees> you can't do a post with jsonp >.>
[09:46:58] <robertmaxrees> does the other server support CORS?
[09:47:21] <Prometheian> Because of work-related limitations, I am taking an HTML page and outputting it as a PDF. However the application that's doing this (abcpdf) is using IE8 and my divs/tables are running to the edge of the page and not terminating pretty. There any styling options I can dump on top of em, or jQuery magic, to make it work right?
[09:48:14] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian add some padding around the body.  or use phantomjs instead.
[09:49:12] <Prometheian> phantomjs not an option, padding it is :P
[09:49:22] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[09:49:33] <robertmaxrees> padding might not fix it, but it's work a try.
[09:49:55] <Prometheian> Yup! I'll give it a go
[09:50:05] <Prometheian> Nope :(
[09:50:19] <robertmaxrees> can you define "not terminating pretty"?
[09:50:29] <Prometheian> I can shoot you a screenshot?
[09:51:04] <robertmaxrees> feel free to push one out to the channel, sure.
[09:52:11] <Prometheian> http://i.imgur.com/B6RP4gO.jpg
[09:52:38] <Prometheian> It runs off on the right
[09:52:45] <robertmaxrees> that looks like a width issue.,
[09:53:03] <Prometheian> Yeah, prolly is but my attempts to fix have failed thus far
[09:53:23] <robertmaxrees> you could alwyas get one of those free IE8 vms
[09:54:02] <Prometheian> It looks fine in IE8's print preview, that's the thing
[09:54:08] <Prometheian> Just when I render it out
[09:54:10] <Prometheian> through this
[09:55:32] <Prometheian> weird shit
[09:55:36] <robertmaxrees> the tool likely isn't using print styles.
[09:56:59] <Prometheian> kk I'll see if I can turn em on
[09:57:11] <robertmaxrees> errr, why would you turn on print styles?
[09:57:24] <Prometheian> If it isn't using them?
[09:57:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean to say that it's probably creating the PDF directly off the page, not simulating a printer.
[09:57:32] <robertmaxrees> unless the docs say otherwise.
[09:58:04] <Prometheian> At this point, with how much random shit issues I've had with this god damned abcpdf, I'm not willing to discount anything.
[09:59:05] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use phantomjs?
[09:59:40] <Prometheian> Technically I could, but I'd be implemented an entire JS library just to make a page line up right?
[10:00:05] <robertmaxrees> it's an executable that you pass stuff to  pretty simple.
[10:00:23] <robertmaxrees> and it uses webkit (last i checked), so you'll have less rendering quirkes.
[10:00:38] <Prometheian> You mean use it as the pdf renderer?
[10:00:43] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:00:59] <robertmaxrees> you could also get your current thing to work by inspecting everything and making sure you're not setting some kind errant width/min-width somewhere.
[10:01:15] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/yiwugege/1/edit
[10:01:20] <damarusama> so that's the base idea
[10:01:31] <damarusama> user can add as many multi select as they wany
[10:01:34] <damarusama> want
[10:01:36] <Prometheian> I'd have to wrestle phantomjs into this archaic C# backend, probably more work then it's worth.
[10:01:58] <damarusama> and I want to gather the total from all the array that are created, right now I only gather the total from one array
[10:02:17] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian if you can make a command-line call to an external executable, you can run phantom.  your call.
[10:02:27] <robertmaxrees> damarusama "the total"?  total what?
[10:02:35] <Prometheian> I'll consider it, ty ^^
[10:03:23] <damarusama> well I sum up all the element of the array later with a parseInt
[10:03:43] <robertmaxrees> damarusama you want to create one array with everything that was selected?
[10:04:09] <damarusama> from many multiple select
[10:04:17] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:04:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:04:19] <damarusama> that can be generated from the user
[10:04:20] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:04:36] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating it ;)
[10:04:46] <damarusama> most probably indeed ;)
[10:05:22] <damarusama> I just need to sum the parseInt of all the element, but if the multiselect change, I need that sum to change too
[10:05:38] <robertmaxrees> also, you're duplicating IDs.
[10:05:44] <robertmaxrees> and you don't even need an ID in this case.
[10:06:44] <damarusama> well I was trying to add a counter to the IDs so that they're unique
[10:07:04] <robertmaxrees> you were giving the parent div and the <select> the same ID.
[10:08:57] <damarusama> right, and I can't have a .change on the new elements created by the user?
[10:09:16] <robertmaxrees> you could, or you could use event delegation :) one sec.
[10:10:12] <dagerik> robertmaxrees: no support for CORS
[10:10:22] <robertmaxrees> dagerik then you can't post to the other domain.
[10:10:26] <robertmaxrees> damarusama almost done.
[10:11:01] <dagerik> robertmaxrees: <form action="http://foo/" method="post"></form><script document.forms[0].submit()</script>
[10:11:15] <damarusama> :)
[10:11:20] <robertmaxrees> damarusama huh?
[10:11:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean with ajax?
[10:11:55] <phoenixsun> is there is good jQuery library for that Mute/UnMute Pop-Out slider style volume button?
[10:12:06] * damarusama smiles in gratitude after 20 hours of hairpulling
[10:14:58] <robertmaxrees> there we go -> http://jsbin.com/ruruqana/1/edit
[10:15:10] <robertmaxrees> not perfect, but shows you the basic idea.
[10:15:27] <damarusama> ho my glob
[10:15:39] <damarusama> thanks
[10:16:12] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: thanks. I will work on it
[10:16:41] <damarusama> I see the master array - nice
[10:17:32] <damarusama> ha ok and using classes and the .each to check them all
[10:18:06] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: thanks - that gives me a really good kick in the right direction
[10:32:17] <Hyperking> Anyone familiar with the name of a site that would render mobile mockups for a variety of devices?
[10:33:12] <Goop> opinion from a native JS stand-point about declaring strings.
[10:33:20] <Goop> var string = new String(); or var string = '';
[10:33:30] <Goop> or does it matter and they are synonymous?
[10:33:36] <Jattenalle> the latter
[10:33:49] <Jattenalle> var string = '';
[10:33:57] <Goop> it always feels wrong when I do that.
[10:34:00] <Jattenalle> end result is the same, but they dont work the same
[10:34:02] <Goop> but ok
[10:34:10] <Goop> how do they differ?
[10:34:38] <robertmaxrees> !g crockfor hardly new ya
[10:34:39] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript, We Hardly new Ya - YUI Blog → http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/13/javascript-we-hardly-new-ya/
[10:34:43] <Goop> one is NULL the other is blank?
[10:34:51] <robertmaxrees> hah - still got it - check out that article.
[10:34:53] <Jattenalle> well, new Type is more explicit and, (if i recall correctly.. been a while) a bit slower
[10:35:12] <Goop> ok!  performance matters to me! thanks
[10:35:13] <Jattenalle> setting it to just an empty string can be optimized a bit more, ie: var string;
[10:35:20] <Goop> nope!
[10:35:26] <Goop> var string; == undefined
[10:35:32] <robertmaxrees> var string = '';
[10:35:34] <Goop> so when you concat latter on, you get undefined at the beginning
[10:35:38] <Jattenalle> yeah i mean in the cmopiler/optimizer, not in your actual code :)
[10:35:47] <robertmaxrees> just do var myThing;
[10:36:11] <Jattenalle> var string = ''; is faster, or at least it WAS faster
[10:36:16] <Goop> can't (if you concat, you get undefinedconcattedstuffs)
[10:36:18] <Jattenalle> nowadays, who knows.. so much going on
[10:36:19] <robertmaxrees> Goop check out that article from crockfod.  it'll help clear things up.  and it is faster.
[10:36:20] <Goop> with var myThing
[10:36:27] <drej> hey, anyone know jsconf organizers?
[10:36:29] <robertmaxrees> Goop you sure about that?
[10:36:33] <Goop> positive
[10:36:38] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, yeah
[10:36:40] <Goop> try it out
[10:36:42] <Jattenalle> you cant leave it empty
[10:36:53] <Goop> I'll just use var string = '';
[10:36:58] <Jattenalle> var string; var something = ' whatever ' + string + ' what';
[10:37:08] <Jattenalle> will show as undefined
[10:37:11] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah okay
[10:37:30] <robertmaxrees> weird morning.
[10:37:38] <Jattenalle> anyhow, = '' is faster than new String because it doesnt call all the fancy background things and whatnot
[10:37:44] <Jattenalle> no idea how it actually works
[10:37:59] <robertmaxrees> heh, the article from crockford explains it ;)
[10:38:05] <robertmaxrees> there's a useless object wrapper you don't need.
[10:39:01] <Jattenalle> i only use the new thing for arrays and objects
[10:39:05] <Jattenalle> never for numbers and strings
[10:39:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it there, either.
[10:39:12] <Jattenalle> just set 'em to = 0 or  = ''
[10:39:13] <Goop> I tend to just var obj = {}
[10:39:15] <Jattenalle> yeah i know, i just like it
[10:39:17] <Goop> or var array = [];
[10:39:27] <robertmaxrees> Goop yep, that's the smarter wa.
[10:39:30] <Jattenalle> i like the "at a glance" overview it gives
[10:39:53] <Jattenalle> and since i only define them once, there's no performance problem
[10:39:57] <robertmaxrees> doing the literals works for me visually.
[10:40:17] <Jattenalle> it comes down to style mostly
[10:40:19] <Jattenalle> preference*
[10:40:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7375120/why-is-arr-faster-than-arr-new-array
[10:40:55] <robertmaxrees> for some more info.
[10:41:17] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, aye, but like i said, only defining once, so performance isnt an issue
[10:41:29] <Jattenalle> lol @ the Object.create() method though..
[10:41:31] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember if calling incurs a performance hit or not.
[10:41:44] <Jattenalle> it doesnt, once defined, it's the same
[10:41:47] <Jattenalle> i've tested that ;)
[10:41:54] <robertmaxrees> can you toss over the perf?
[10:42:02] <Jattenalle> dont have one
[10:42:05] <Jattenalle> simple enough to make
[10:43:56] <Litmus> I'm sending my files object through ajax but I also need to send other string parameters. But the files object requires contentType: false; to be set... how would I get around this?
[10:46:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsperf.com/new-array-vs-literal/7 hrm.
[10:53:54] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, that's a bit missleading.. setting the length just sets the length.. it's just one less ++ in there
[10:54:11] <robertmaxrees> aye - i'm trying a few different things atm.
[10:54:12] <Jattenalle> either way though, no difference
[10:54:20] <Jattenalle> between = [] and new Array
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> I'd always heard there was a difference, so I'm interested to see if that's true.
[10:54:57] <Jattenalle> i did pretty much the same test you did there, except i had the array location be random between 0 and length
[10:55:05] <robertmaxrees> i didn't make that test.
[10:55:10] <Jattenalle> (with a fixed length set of course)
[10:55:12] <Jattenalle> oh, well
[10:56:07] <Jattenalle> i'll be streaming some game development live in ~30 minutes.. fair bit of jquery/html/js in there for the UI
[10:56:17] <Jattenalle> in case anyone wants to check that out :)
[10:56:26] <Jattenalle> .. and laugh at my bad code
[10:56:54] <robertmaxrees> now i have a perf that says literals are faster - could you try to debunk this one? http://jsperf.com/new-array-vs-literal/22
[10:57:13] <robertmaxrees> well, at least, running.push() against a literal is faster.
[10:58:25] <EminenceHC> What is wrong with my code here? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/064612db8355fa8652c4 The on change event works as expected but not the on load event and I feel its doing the same thing so I can't figure out why.
[10:59:00] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC where is the onload?
[10:59:15] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees, no idea what's going on there
[11:00:09] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: The whole thing is wrapped in an unload, but the second block of code there will detect if the change has already been made instead of when the field changes.
[11:00:50] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC i'd need to see a more complete working example in a bin.
[11:01:43] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Can I call $(this) on ($CheckTask) like I am doing or is that a noon?
[11:01:48] <EminenceHC> no no**
[11:02:00] <robertmaxrees> oh, no.
[11:02:15] <robertmaxrees> that line isn't scoped the same way it is earlier.
[11:02:23] <robertmaxrees> if statments don't have scope.  functions do.
[11:03:10] <cawaker> hmm any ideas of clean way to display a giant list of ip addresses on a webpage?
[11:03:27] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: What is the proper way to write that? Make it a function?
[11:03:30] <BillCriswell> cawaker: line by line?
[11:04:25] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, +1
[11:04:30] <cawaker> lol
[11:04:40] <Jattenalle> i was going to say: Try code
[11:04:44] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC use an each?
[11:04:45] <Jattenalle> but line by line is a better approach
[11:04:58] <cawaker> actually maybe i dont need to show the list by default, I'll just hide that crap.
[11:05:08] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC i assume you want to find the $('show-tick') with the .val() of 82?
[11:05:08] <Jattenalle> cawaker, group them
[11:05:15] <Jattenalle> cawaker, serious answer btw ^^
[11:05:21] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: yeah
[11:05:41] <Jattenalle> cawaker, depending on the IPs and ranges.. ie: 192.168.0.* is one list of at most 256 entries
[11:06:17] <Jattenalle> cawaker, or just sort them descending order.. and have it be pages.. show 10-50-100-whatever IPs per page
[11:06:19] <cawaker> yeah these are random IP son a whitelist, but grouping by 5 or 10 at a time can be a easy way to show them
[11:06:26] <Jattenalle> ^^
[11:06:30] <robertmaxrees> also, $checkTask should just be checkTask - no preceding $ since it's not a jquery object.  also also, just use $('.show-tick') - prepending the nodename incurs a small performance hit.  also also also cache that selector.
[11:06:49] <cawaker> i actually have a layout in mind now, that helped thank Jattenalle
[11:06:54] <Jattenalle> if it's a whitelist, wouldnt they also be associated with something? ie: [insert 15 IPs here] belong to OoogaBooga Corp.
[11:07:07] <Jattenalle> so you could group them by what they belong to, or somesuch
[11:07:09] * Jattenalle shrugs
[11:07:14] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC var $showTick = $('.show-tick');  then use $showTick wherever you're currently using the selector.
[11:07:34] <BillCriswell> Why did I install Adobe Creative cloud.
[11:07:54] <cawaker> yeah kinda, but in this context just sorting by range and displaying in small groups makes more sense.
[11:08:46] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: var $showTick = $('.show-tick'); or var $showTick = $('.show-tick').val(); ?
[11:09:58] <robertmaxrees> the first one
[11:11:33] <robertmaxrees> the second one will get you the val() of the first thing that matches that selector.
[11:11:52] <robertmaxrees> and the prepended $ on the variable name suggests that variable holds a jquery object, not a string/number/etc.
[11:12:41] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, because you like pain? i'm sure there are internet communities that cater to your... preferences ;)
[11:13:26] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: It's driving me nuts.
[11:13:48] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I see. Why wouldnt this work? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/6da0c21c41992a0b90f9
[11:14:20] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC because  $checkTask = $("select.show-tick").val(); grabs the value of the first select.
[11:14:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not magically enumerating through all selects you want.
[11:15:07] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Oh I see.
[11:15:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/val/ <- "Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements."
[11:15:28] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: But I fail to see how I can solve it with the solution you gave earlier.
[11:16:02] <robertmaxrees> so you want  $("select.show-tick").each(function() { if ($(this).val() === '82') { $(this).closest('td').find('.number-of-students').show(); } })
[11:16:18] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually run through each element in that case.
[11:17:29] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I totally get it now. Thanks for your patience.
[11:17:34] <robertmaxrees> of course :)
[11:17:39] <robertmaxrees> the api docs are my best friend.
[11:18:13] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I try to read the api docs but sometimes I cant see a practical example from them.
[11:21:03] <robertmaxrees> i would look less for examples and more at words :)
[11:23:44] <Litmus> I'm sending my files object through ajax but I also need to send other string parameters. But the files object requires contentType: false; to be set... how would I get around this?
[11:26:47] <robertmaxrees> something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21060247/send-formdata-and-string-data-together-through-jquery-ajax ?
[11:36:08] <linagee> does anyone here use jquery form plugin? (http://malsup.com/jquery/form/)
[11:39:04] <txt23> hey guys can someone do UI test for us? On our home page https://www.urbantrafficschool.com when you select county does it automatically fill in different courts?
[11:39:43] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ linagee
[11:39:43] <b-ot> linagee: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:43:53] <robertmaxrees> txt23 you mean does the courts dropdown update?  because it did for me.
[11:45:07] <txt23> robbyoconnor: Okay thats good thing
[11:45:21] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete ;)
[11:45:35] <txt23> robertmaxrees: Yeah lol. For some users it was not working
[11:45:54] <txt23> robertmaxrees: Thanks for checking it out though
[11:46:06] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:48:25] <phoenixsun> what is the go to resource for dealing with IE compatibility issues?
[11:48:31] <Jattenalle> in case anyone's curious, i'm streaming at http://www.twitch.tv/apistudios/ working on my game, interface is done in html, which means jquery.. feel free to hate on my code ;)
[11:48:53] <phoenixsun> I tried modern.ie and it said my site was fine on IE and alas it is not
[11:48:54] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun what do you mean?
[11:49:06] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun why not download the IE VMs?
[11:49:28] <phoenixsun> I actually have Windows laptop to hand if I need it
[11:49:58] <phoenixsun> but was wondering if there is some way of scanning and identifying problems
[11:50:08] <phoenixsun> otherwise I am just searching in the dark
[11:50:16] <phoenixsun> well apart from the IE console error output
[11:50:33] <Litmus> how do you capture content that was sent with contenttype: false?
[11:50:35] <Litmus> with php
[11:50:59] <phoenixsun> phoenixsun: I am not sure it the main issue is with CSS or jQuery
[11:51:05] <vsmith> Hey guys I have an issue on a site i am working on currently.  What i am trying to accomplish is that on items on the page where people add to cart the "add to cart" button remains disabled until the person actually selects a color.   This is the page  http://199.167.200.52/~ccanvas/special-offers/
[11:51:08] <robertmaxrees> Litmus you'll want to ask in #php
[11:51:27] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees:  I am not sure it the main issue is with CSS or jQuery
[11:51:27] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun there's no magic bullet for that.  what's the error you're getting?
[11:51:28] <Litmus> +i only
[11:51:28] <vsmith> This is the code i am using.  http://pastie.org/9453737
[11:51:47] <vsmith> can anyone point me in the right direction
[11:52:05] <vsmith> ??
[11:52:43] <robertmaxrees> vsmith you want prop(), not .attr()
[11:53:04] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled', true); and .prop('disabled', false);
[11:53:05] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[11:53:30] <robertmaxrees> Litmus did you try ##php?
[11:53:35] <vsmith> robertmaxrees  currently all of the "add to cart" buttons are being disabled
[11:53:42] <vsmith> on the page
[11:53:53] <Allen300> Ah ok
[11:53:54] <robertmaxrees> vsmith i'm making a general suggest for you.
[11:53:56] <Allen300> thank you
[11:53:59] <vsmith> http://199.167.200.52/~ccanvas/special-offers/
[11:54:11] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: In terms of Javascript  I am getting errors like 'JSON' is unidentified in jquery.min.js
[11:54:23] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun that usually means you're passing things around incorrectly.
[11:54:29] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[11:54:43] <vsmith> I  just want the current  product "add to cart" to be enabled when color is chosen
[11:54:53] <robertmaxrees> vsmith i'm seeing a javascript error btw - you should probably try ixing that first.
[11:55:24] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: version 2.0.3
[11:55:35] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun the 2.x series drops support for old IE.
[11:55:38] <vsmith> robertmaxrees im only seeing a 404 error
[11:55:38] <robertmaxrees> the 1.x series keeps it.
[11:56:10] <phoenixsun> I am testing it on IE9. I thought that was newish
[11:56:22] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun nope.
[11:56:30] <vsmith> robertmaxrees  I pretty confident that error is not affecting what i want to do
[11:56:52] <TheWhisper> Anyone in here use Velocity.js and can help me with something?
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> vsmith i'm giving you basic things to start with.  you can also check out fixingthesejquery.com for more tips.
[11:57:11] <TheWhisper> I have this line: function() { return r(-100, 100) + '%' }
[11:57:20] <TheWhisper> for translateX/Y/width
[11:57:53] <TheWhisper> but when I run it, it adds other properties to the element: http://i.imgur.com/E0TP5mb.png
[11:58:24] <BillCriswell> Android Emulation is so much fun.
[11:58:41] <BillCriswell> Minus the downloading tons of shit.
[11:58:59] <robertmaxrees> like anything java :)
[12:00:05] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: if I roll back to using an old version of jQuery will that fix the old IE issue/
[12:00:08] <phoenixsun> ?
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun 1.x is not "old".
[12:00:31] <robertmaxrees> there are 2 series that get the same features.  1.x series keeps old ie support.  2.x drops it.
[12:01:13] <phoenixsun> so what is the benefit of choosing 2.x over 1.x/
[12:01:16] <phoenixsun> ?
[12:01:20] <robertmaxrees> smaller filesize.
[12:01:31] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need to support old browsers, don't.
[12:01:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/download/ for more info.
[12:02:03] <phoenixsun> ok thanks will look
[12:02:22] <robertmaxrees> interesting, IE9 should still be supported by 2.x according to that page.
[12:02:24] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm....
[12:02:58] <phoenixsun> well I am pretty sure that its not loading
[12:03:08] <phoenixsun> unless its a CSS issue also
[12:03:16] <phoenixsun> but there are many javascript errors
[12:03:31] <phoenixsun> almost 10
[12:03:58] <robertmaxrees> severe enough errors can break everything and make it seem like something isn't loading.
[12:04:08] <robertmaxrees> what are some errors you're seeing?
[12:04:22] <phoenixsun> it doesnt even like this -> '$document.ready()
[12:04:30] <robertmaxrees> $document isn't a thing.
[12:04:32] <robertmaxrees> $(document) is
[12:04:56] <phoenixsun> right in the code its properly typed
[12:05:03] <phoenixsun> was just being lazy here
[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> what the error that line throws?
[12:06:38] <phoenixsun> Objete expected
[12:06:44] <phoenixsun> Object*
[12:06:58] <robertmaxrees> can you share more of your code?
[12:07:06] <robertmaxrees> in a fixee or something similar?
[12:07:23] <phoenixsun> ok
[12:09:21] <phoenixsun> this is the snippet that shows that particular error: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=o0ELHpONfg
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> i need more context.
[12:10:44] <robertmaxrees> also: is your markup valid?
[12:11:23] <phoenixsun> well I think it is
[12:11:32] <robertmaxrees> have you passed it through a validator?
[12:11:42] <phoenixsun> I used modern.ie
[12:11:51] <phoenixsun> is there some other tool you recommend?
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> w3c's validator is pretty awesome.
[12:12:20] <phoenixsun> ok I will run it through there before anything else
[12:12:29] <phoenixsun> just maybe its a simple issue…maybe
[12:13:19] <robertmaxrees> if you can sharemore of your js, that'd be helpful.
[12:15:01] <phoenixsun> ok its says 14 errors so I will work though those and see
[12:15:17] <zeroquake> hey , i have an array of objects(each object having string and a integer) , is it better to copy all the strings into an array ---> search for a match -- get index and then using this index read the integer values from the object?
[12:15:42] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake do what now?  can you share a copy of what you've got?
[12:16:15] <zeroquake> i have somthing like this
[12:16:16] <zeroquake> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/AsJil
[12:16:46] <zeroquake> i have search bar , when user enter some text
[12:16:55] <robertmaxrees> right, you're matching against things.
[12:16:58] <zeroquake> i need to show em matching string
[12:17:00] <zeroquake> yes
[12:17:36] <zeroquake> is it better to iterate thru each object and try match -- or use filter on an array of strings
[12:18:01] <robertmaxrees> how are you going to match the result from the new array to this one?
[12:18:11] <zeroquake> using index
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> err, then don't move things to a new array.
[12:18:26] <zeroquake> both the indexes correspond to each other
[12:18:32] <robertmaxrees> also: you're trying to use an array with key/value pairs.
[12:18:36] <robertmaxrees> why not just use an object?
[12:19:03] <zeroquake> let me put it up in codepen . gimme 5 mins
[12:19:14] <robertmaxrees> errr, slow down
[12:19:15] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[12:19:39] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/abkmJ
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> why not do this?
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> and then enumerate through the list?
[12:20:12] <robertmaxrees> actually, you'd want those flipped.
[12:21:22] <zeroquake> i need to use .each ? how do u iterate thru attributes in an object?
[12:21:32] <zeroquake> without knowing the  key  ?
[12:21:33] <robertmaxrees> codepen.io/anon/pen/abkmJ - and then you're basically almost using an array.
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> a for in.
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/abkmJ
[12:23:01] <robertmaxrees> where are those numbers coming from?  is there any reason you can't use a vanilla array?
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[12:23:55] <zeroquake> ok , i  dont quite understand , let me try this way.
[12:39:25] <robertmaxrees> weee
[12:40:53] <PantsOfChoco> whats a good site for getting metrics like traffic a site is getting in like unique visitors?
[12:41:07] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco google analytics.
[12:41:15] <robertmaxrees> there's really no way to get past data
[12:41:26] <robertmaxrees> alexa kind of gives you data, but it's not anything I'd trust.
[12:41:37] <PantsOfChoco> just like adaily one i can do the do the rest of the math
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> you can't get that.
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> unless you install analytics.
[12:42:06] <robertmaxrees> how would another site know anything about your visitors?
[12:42:55] <PantsOfChoco> posting it somewhere haha
[12:43:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:43:18] <PantsOfChoco> all i want is unique visitors from other sites
[12:43:22] <PantsOfChoco> dont they brag about that shit haha
[12:43:23] <robertmaxrees> you cannot get that
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> put another way - somebody hits your homepage.  how would a 3rd party know anything about who got to your site?
[12:43:56] <robertmaxrees> unless they specifically referred you, but how would you know who referred you?
[12:44:35] <PantsOfChoco> yea i guess
[12:44:40] <PantsOfChoco> itd have to be tracked by ip
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> it's even simpler than that - there's no way for a random third party to know who's visiting your site.  you need to setup google analytics.
[12:45:39] <PantsOfChoco> doesnt alexa pull from that?
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> alexa relies on people having a toolbar installed last i checked.
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> it's fuzzy and unreliable, at best.
[12:46:42] <PantsOfChoco> yea well i dont need full accurate at the moment
[12:47:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't trust alexa for any reason whatsever.  setup google analytics.
[12:47:23] <PantsOfChoco> haha sales pitching i dont need that accurate data hahaha
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sales pitching.  alexa is not a good source of that info.
[12:47:44] <robertmaxrees> i dodn't eve work with google.
[12:47:49] <PantsOfChoco> no im saying its for a pitch haha
[12:47:59] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even use it for that personally.
[12:51:02] <PantsOfChoco> DAMNIT ROBERT JUST BELIEVEEEE
[12:51:26] <drej> yeah, rober! what's your problem?
[12:51:29] <drej> robert
[12:51:33] <drej> if that is your real name.
[12:51:53] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:55:50] <krambiorix> how can i validate a date like DD/MM/YYYY ?
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> moment.js has a validator iirc.
[12:56:48] <BillCriswell> I imagine a bad one would just return false
[12:58:49] <BillCriswell> Ah, also there's an .isValid()
[12:59:09] <robertmaxrees> i just avoid letting users input dates altogether.
[12:59:41] <BillCriswell> They're all jerks.
[13:00:22] <hugo_moss> hello i am having a problem with the jquery ui shake effect, it shakes, but then causes the div blocks above it to jump up
[13:00:25] <krambiorix> lol
[13:00:30] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: after running through W3C validation the page is mostly working
[13:00:44] <phoenixsun> just one a little CSS here and there that I knew I took a risk on
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> good
[13:00:56] <phoenixsun> and a Z issue
[13:00:59] <krambiorix> i tried validating with if(/Invalid|NaN/.test(new Date(v)) && v != ''){  -> but if i fill in 0/01/2014 -> it validates ....
[13:02:16] <krambiorix> anyone?
[13:02:18] <phoenixsun> Z index I mean
[13:03:10] <samuel> anyone know how to have separate css files for different sections ? kinda like jsfiddle?
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix setup a bin
[13:03:32] <robertmaxrees> samuel huh?
[13:04:35] <samuel> i want to have my page a style and then I want to write code and output it to another section on my pagewith a totally differnet css
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle uses an iframe for the result area
[13:07:36] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AoBn5oS9Dv
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> one sec.  let me get chrome up.
[13:08:53] <robertmaxrees> ooh nvm derp.
[13:10:06] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix console.log(new Date(v)); <- slap that before the if check.
[13:10:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll see what's up :)
[13:10:19] <BillCriswell> I am really glad I mostly work in web browsers.
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[13:10:27] <drej> as opposed to non web browsers?
[13:10:29] <drej> :)
[13:10:36] <drej> fuck those stone-based browsers are a pain in the ass
[13:10:56] <BillCriswell> I mean like building "real" apps haha
[13:11:08] <BillCriswell> I feel like whenever I try to do something my computer wants to explode.
[13:11:12] <guzzlefry> Can you bind event handlers to a document fragment before attaching it to the dom?
[13:11:25] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: YEs.
[13:11:34] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry the contents of the fragment are what's appended, not the fragment itself.
[13:11:41] <robertmaxrees> so you could, but it'd do no good.
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> why not bind a delegated listener to a parent instead?
[13:11:54] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yeah it parses it like december but it should be 0 january if you fill in 0/01/2014
[13:12:18] <guzzlefry> hm, this is colorbox, wonder if I have anything sane to bind to.
[13:12:21] * guzzlefry looks
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry a parent element?
[13:12:30] <krambiorix> 0/01/2014 shouldn't be a valid date
[13:12:53] <wa5ted> hey quick question
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix but the date object is parsing it as such.  fun, huh?
[13:12:58] <wa5ted> i have overflow: hidden:
[13:13:04] <wa5ted> on my body and html tags
[13:13:12] <wa5ted> ut i want to enable scrolling for a single div
[13:13:17] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, amazing...
[13:13:25] <wa5ted> contained within the body
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted overflow: scroll; on that div.
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> with a set height.
[13:13:38] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, it means i can't validate that format as such
[13:13:49] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: auto would be a ebttter option no?
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix not with the date object, no.  check out moment.js
[13:13:54] <wa5ted> i tried auto and it didnt work
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted auto will keep growing the size of the div...
[13:14:23] <wa5ted> okay
[13:14:27] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i have to get moment.js just for one validation?
[13:14:52] <wa5ted> i would share it to see my spefic use case but its a sass foudnation project with custom stuff
[13:15:05] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted there's nothing special in that case.
[13:15:09] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: my other issue is that my body and html is set to 100%
[13:15:15] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix date validation is always a massive PITA.  you'll have to resort to using either the full lib or look for some kind of regex.
[13:15:25] <wa5ted> so even if i do overflow: scroll
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not making any sense now.
[13:15:48] <wa5ted> 100% height
[13:15:58] <robertmaxrees> i hear that - what does that have to do with a specific div?
[13:16:08] <krambiorix> can't find one
[13:16:12] <wa5ted> well when i do overflow: scroll
[13:16:17] <wa5ted> scrollbars are still idabled
[13:16:28] <wa5ted> and i cant see the scroll down button
[13:16:39] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted you have to set a specific height for that to work.
[13:17:20] <wa5ted> okay hmmmmm
[13:17:41] <losted> Hi, I’m not sure if I’m at the right place to ask this but… I made an animation with jQuery where I use .css(‘transform’) to animate some canvas with CSS transition, it works well in Chrome and Safari but its very janky in Firefox and I’m not sure why… is anyone good at this and willing to give me a hand? Thanks
[13:17:49] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: if i set the body and html to 100% is there any way to insert elements that will be of the same height as the body
[13:17:54] <wa5ted> aka the window
[13:18:04] <wa5ted> keep in mind I do have a header
[13:18:08] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted why are you setting body and html to 100% height in the first place?
[13:18:18] <wa5ted> because its a single screen
[13:18:21] <wa5ted> should not be scrollable
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> so it shouldn't be scrollable.  but it should?
[13:18:31] <wa5ted> web app like
[13:18:40] <wa5ted> well the overall page should not be
[13:18:48] <wa5ted> but certain divs should be
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm not getting something here.
[13:19:20] <robertmaxrees> an example would be awesome.
[13:19:38] <wa5ted> hmmm let me see if i can put somethign together
[13:19:40] <BillCriswell> Hm, browserstack price went up.
[13:19:51] <wa5ted> let me take another crack at this
[13:20:07] <wa5ted> i am building a web app
[13:20:15] <wa5ted> from what i have seen
[13:20:24] <wa5ted> the overall window of any web app has no overflow
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted i cannot help unless i see a working example.
[13:20:37] <guzzlefry> well, this doesn't work as expected, $.colorbox.element().on('click', 'button', function(){console.log('hello');}); Any ideas?
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> what does $.colorbox.element() return?
[13:22:25] <guzzlefry> according to the docs: This method is used to fetch the current HTML element that Colorbox is associated with. Returns a jQuery object containing the element.
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd select something explicitly in the document, instead.
[13:23:09] <fabio_> its possible to call a jquery function from a variable? i mean var x = 'post';     $.x()
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:23:34] <guzzlefry> will do, thanks
[13:23:52] <fabio_> ive tryed $.eval(x)()
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ back up.  what are you trying to do, because that question makes no sense.
[13:24:28] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/xzfe4da5/
[13:24:35] <fabio_> robertmaxrees,  i want to call a $.post or $.get based on x variable
[13:24:39] <wa5ted> ^i want to enable scrolling on main so that the li elements are scrollable
[13:24:44] <fabio_> i dont want to do if
[13:25:01] <drej> wa5ted there's no jquery there?
[13:25:05] <robertmaxrees> then you want $[x]
[13:25:06] <wa5ted> fabio_: test the variable before you $.get/$.post
[13:25:16] <wa5ted> drej: cause its a css problem
[13:25:18] <wa5ted> wait i forgot somethign
[13:25:24] <drej> you forgot that you're not in #css ?
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ so var x = 'post'; $[x]();
[13:25:32] <fabio_> wa5ted, i dont want to do a if statement
[13:25:43] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted oh, you're doing this in css?  you need to go to the css channel for help then.
[13:25:52] <fabio_> robertmaxrees,  it will work?
[13:26:06] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/xzfe4da5/1/
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ that's called an object property accessor.
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted you need to ask in #css
[13:26:32] <wa5ted> really?
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> that's OT for this channel.
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were doing something funky with jquery.
[13:27:00] <wa5ted> its a simple css problem
[13:27:06] <drej> ...
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:27:11] <drej> wow
[13:27:13] <robertmaxrees> so take it to the channel about #css
[13:27:20] <wa5ted> wtf
[13:27:23] <drej> robertmaxrees woah woah, slow down there
[13:27:33] <drej> you mean, css problems go in the #css room?
[13:27:36] <drej> wtf since when ?
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[13:27:38] <drej> thats just crazy talk!
[13:27:43] <wa5ted> drej: thats what i thought
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> brb i'm going to ask #music quesitons about jquery
[13:27:55] <drej> wa5ted clearly sarcasm is something you're not familiar with. you dolt.
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted he's being funny.
[13:27:57] <wa5ted> #jquery has always entertained my "ridiculous" questions
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> we're not calling you ridiculous.
[13:28:08] <drej> i am
[13:28:24] <robertmaxrees> hah, i'm not at least ;)
[13:28:28] <wa5ted> no it makes sense why drej hates
[13:28:30] <wa5ted> now*
[13:28:31] <drej> also, dude, this is trivial css, you should know how to make an element scroll
[13:28:39] <drej> i dont hate, i have a low tolerance for stupidity
[13:28:44] <drej> there's a difference
[13:29:02] <wa5ted> i do, but the whole reason for asking is im asking someone to help me and look over what ive written cause clearly i cant get the right behavious
[13:29:16] <drej> you didnt even apply any css to the .main
[13:29:25] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted right, which is why you ask in #css
[13:29:39] <drej> but yes, ^ that
[13:29:41] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/xzfe4da5/2/
[13:30:02] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted please take it to css
[13:30:29] <wa5ted> wish shoky or jphase was here
[13:30:57] <wa5ted> #css half the time is dead
[13:31:06] <thinkxl> not true
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> also: drej is a mod in #css ;)
[13:31:19] <robertmaxrees> the man is smart.
[13:31:25] <drej> also, good looking
[13:31:26] <drej> you forgot that part
[13:31:30] <thinkxl> bad luck to you that drej is in #css too, lol
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:31:49] <wa5ted> which is my fucking point
[13:31:53] <wa5ted> if hes in both channels
[13:31:58] <wa5ted> why the fuck am i being directed there
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> it's still off topic.
[13:32:03] <wa5ted> esp. since hes senior cause hes a mod
[13:32:07] <thinkxl> wa5ted: context
[13:32:23] <wa5ted> so essentially your sayign that css and jquery have nothing to dowith each other
[13:32:27] <wa5ted> thats what you are implying
[13:32:32] <drej> nope
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> no, we're saying #css is a channel about what you're working with.
[13:32:39] <drej> thats not what anyone's saying
[13:32:42] <thinkxl> wa5ted: I'm basically that there are more people that can helpyou with css in #css :)
[13:32:51] <drej> also jquery and css are web technologies, and there's midget porn on the internet
[13:32:52] <wa5ted> thinkxl: i asked a simple css question, sure may seem stupid, but absolutely simple, they are fuckign redirectling me to #css
[13:32:56] <drej> but you dont see anyone talking about midget porn in here
[13:32:57] <drej> right ?
[13:33:09] <drej> anyway, stop whining, you got your question answered
[13:33:10] * thinkxl get a boner
[13:33:47] <thinkxl> there are rules here too
[13:33:53] <drej> yup, like no whining
[13:33:55] <wa5ted> sure
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:34:06] <wa5ted> but i didnt know that #jquery changed since the last time i was here
[13:34:11] <wa5ted> where the rules state that no
[13:34:11] <drej> it didnt.
[13:34:16] <drej> its common fucking sense
[13:34:16] <wa5ted> no css questin is to be entertained
[13:34:18] <Jattenalle> too much fighting, why dont you guys tune into my stream, featuring me.. also starring.. me
[13:34:19] <drej> you entitled prick.
[13:34:24] <drej> its a specific topic channel, stick to the topic
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted you need to calm down
[13:34:28] <drej> that is a freenode-wide implementation
[13:34:36] <wa5ted> okay then do me a favour
[13:34:38] <drej> otherwise there would just be one room
[13:34:44] <wa5ted> when there is some css to be done along side jqurey
[13:34:46] <wa5ted> dotn do css
[13:34:46] * thinkxl grabs popcorn
[13:34:47] <drej> wa5ted i already gave you your answer in #css
[13:34:48] <wa5ted> dont
[13:34:51] <drej> stop being a dick.
[13:34:56] <drej> you entitled twat
[13:34:57] <wa5ted> drej i dont give a fuck
[13:35:00] <wa5ted> your being two sided
[13:35:04] <drej> you're*
[13:35:06] <drej> and no im not
[13:35:09] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: i really dont care about your pm
[13:35:14] * drej shrugs
[13:35:16] <drej> we're done here
[13:35:24] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted you should.
[13:35:42] <wa5ted> oh joy another fucking mod
[13:35:48] <thinkxl> HAHA
[13:35:57] <Jattenalle> lol
[13:36:51] <thinkxl> undercover ops is the way to go these days
[13:37:06] <robertmaxrees> it's policy in this channel.
[13:37:31] <thinkxl> my first irc experience was in undernet when half of users was @'s
[13:37:32] <drej> as most channels on freenode
[13:42:05] <robertmaxrees> back to the regular program.
[13:43:56] <thinkxl> midget porn and stuff
[13:44:02] <thinkxl> and a little of jQuery
[13:45:04] <fabio_> what you guys think?
[13:45:04] <fabio_> http://jsfiddle.net/fabiomiguel3/zso4zpdc/
[13:45:17] <fabio_> robertmaxrees, check it
[13:45:23] <fabio_> robertmaxrees, :)
[13:45:30] <thinkxl> fabio_: about what?
[13:45:33] <EminenceHC> Is there a way to change IE explorer out of compatibilty mode through a web app?
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> by using a valid document.
[13:45:46] <fabio_> thinkxl, a abstracted way to send a form
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ use .prop() instead.
[13:46:25] <fabio_> robertmaxrees, do you like it? im trying to have a re-usable code :)
[13:46:33] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ i wouldn't do it that way personally.
[13:47:21] <fabio_> robertmaxrees,  for any special reason?
[13:47:27] <thinkxl> fabio_: you are doing the code for a fixed markup I mean, one way to do the form
[13:47:48] <fabio_> thinkxl, what you mean mate
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ it's not explicit.  it's implicit.
[13:48:04] <thinkxl> fabio_: robertmaxrees will tell you best, my english sucks
[13:48:21] <fabio_> thinkxl, me too :) i'm portuguese xD
[13:49:43] <vsmith> Hey guys so obviously i have no idea what i am dong because nothing is working .  Can some one look at my code once more.  I have wrote in steps what i am trying to do in the code comments.  http://pastie.org/9453959

[13:50:44] <BillCriswell> This say was fun.
[13:50:47] <BillCriswell> day*
[13:51:00] <BillCriswell> Kind of want to go hit my head against a wall a few times.
[13:51:07] <drej> aww
[13:51:09] * drej hugs BillCriswell 
[13:51:11] <drej> it'll be okay buddy
[13:51:24] <BillCriswell> I sure hope so.
[13:52:37] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Good day all!
[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> fabio_ sorry about that - i'd have different handlers for posting vs getting and be clearer about what my hanbdler is doing.
[13:57:57] <hadees> is there anyway to add url params to a link after you catched it’s click event?
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> hadees sure - prevent default, get the href value, append your stuf,f then window.location.href = theValue
[13:59:09] <hadees> robertmaxrees: i don’t want to use window.location.href because I don’t want the url changing, the link is to a csv file that’ll get downloaded and i don’t want it in the address bar
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm not really familiar with a way to do that then. somebody else might know.
[14:02:59] <hugo_moss> jquery-ui shakes my other elements as a side effect
[14:03:04] <hugo_moss> whats up with that
[14:11:18] <krambiorix> ok here another fiddle of my problem : http://jsfiddle.net/ThedonSolo/2k9ph1c0/1/
[14:12:46] <fabio_> imagine i want to get all inputs of an form and treat them individualy
[14:12:52] <fabio_> i do each right?
[14:13:13] <fabio_> but if i'm treating the form as this?  $(this)
[14:13:16] <fabio_> how to do it?
[14:13:32] <fabio_> $(this).each('input)
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:14:03] <krambiorix> fabio_ $('#myform').find('input').each(function(){....});
[14:14:38] <fabio_> krambiorix, do you think is the best way?
[14:14:51] <krambiorix> i do :D , but who am i :D
[14:15:00] <fabio_> krambiorix,  xD
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing with the inputs?
[14:17:50] <fabio_> robertmaxrees, i will do validation :)
[14:18:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd cache all the selectors in that case.
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:27:18] <fabio_> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/fabiomiguel3/zso4zpdc/2/
[14:32:57] <robertmaxrees> back
[14:35:18] <damarusama> when I use the .val and there is no value="" on an element, it pulls out it's 'content'
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> trying to give you something.
[14:35:48] <damarusama> can I 'force' the .val() to get the content instead of the value ?
[14:35:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:36:00] <damarusama> :(
[14:36:06] <robertmaxrees> you could use something else instead.
[14:36:12] <robertmaxrees> if you want the text, use .text()
[14:36:39] <damarusama> will the text create an array like the val() does on multi select?
[14:36:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:36:49] <damarusama> :(
[14:37:52] <damarusama> can I use jquery to replace the val() with text() before a POST
[14:38:14] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> change the value to hold the actual value you need to send instead.
[14:39:18] <damarusama> yeah but I'm using the value for pricing information
[14:39:59] <damarusama> so I though I would put the name in the label, the price in the content (text) and the value would have the name that is sent in the POST
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> so you want to send over key value pairs?
[14:41:44] <damarusama> pretty much yeah
[14:42:07] <robertmaxrees> check out .serializeArray()
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll be doing some manual work.
[14:43:26] <damarusama> nice serializeArrays seems to be the right direction - then I can POST that array ?
[14:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use that to get your data.
[14:43:46] <systemfault> damarusama: Do you use ajax to send the form?
[14:43:54] <damarusama> not at this point
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:44:04] <damarusama> but seems like it has to go toward that direction
[14:44:06] <systemfault> damarusama: Then no, you don’t want serializeArray.
[14:44:31] <damarusama> sounds like I have to go toward ajax atm
[14:44:33] <systemfault> damarusama: The only way to add data is to add a <input type=“hidden” name=“whatever” value=“lol”> to the form
[14:44:37] <robertmaxrees> you should probably just change the value to be what you actually want to send over.
[14:45:55] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: but then I need to find a way to calculate the total price of the selected element, and with the .val() and summing up that array it worked well
[14:46:24] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes to store your data and rework the solution a little bit.
[14:47:29] <jeffreylevesque> anyone have experience AudioNodes?
[14:47:30] <jeffreylevesque> or AudioContext?
[14:58:12] <infoget> Hi guys, what is name of this effect, when I moving with cursor on the site? http://attackemart.in/
[14:59:18] <systemfault> infoget: Parallax effect
[14:59:30] <systemfault> That specific one is awful though
[15:02:18] <METEMEDO> holy shit
[15:02:21] <infoget> systemfault: Hmhm, I don't know, everything what I found is related with "scrolling", but I'm looking for mouse event
[15:02:39] <METEMEDO> why does $('this_guy').val(''); break the value property?
[15:02:53] <robertmaxrees> METEMEDO how does it break it?
[15:03:09] <METEMEDO> if i do .val('something'); it doesnt apply
[15:03:31] <systemfault> infoget: That’s still called “parallax”, it’s just based on the cursor position instead of the scroll position
[15:04:08] <systemfault> METEMEDO: Unless you have in your HTML an element having a tag named "this_guy", it won't work.
[15:04:18] <susanne> Metemedo, are you forgetting a class selector?
[15:04:24] <systemfault> Like… <this-guy>lol</this-guy>
[15:04:39] <infoget> systemfault: Perfect! I got it! ;) thx
[15:04:41] <systemfault> METEMEDO: What do you want to select by? classname? id?
[15:05:33] <METEMEDO> susanne: no, i do this: var editTipoNome = $('input[name=edit_tipo_nome]');
[15:05:46] <METEMEDO> then, inside a function i do editTipoNome.val('');
[15:06:07] <METEMEDO> then when a part of the function is reached, its set again
[15:06:16] <METEMEDO> editTipoNome.val('something');
[15:06:31] <METEMEDO> it's deleting the value, but not re-applying it
[15:06:47] <METEMEDO> if i inspect the element, it stays <input ... value>
[15:07:13] <robertmaxrees> METEMEDO .val() doesn't necessarily update the DOM.
[15:07:14] <robertmaxrees> btw.
[15:07:37] <systemfault> METEMEDO: Do you have any code you can show us? (On a pastebin.. of course)
[15:08:04] <susanne__> Are you positive that part of the function is being reached?
[15:08:28] <susanne__> What happens if you try to set the value via the console?
[15:09:18] <METEMEDO> systemfault: the entire relevant code is here http://pastebin.com/kFHBQS0G
[15:10:20] <METEMEDO> i've tried console.log on the relevant variables and they print correctly
[15:11:12] <systemfault> METEMEDO: If you try to do: console.log(editTipoNome.length), what is the result?
[15:11:23] <systemfault> Is it possible that the element is not being selected?
[15:11:41] <robertmaxrees> you you have the DOM node and not the jquery object.
[15:11:42] <susanne__> Is tipo.descricao undefined?
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> *or you, rather.
[15:12:01] <METEMEDO> systemfault: 1
[15:12:03] <METEMEDO> the thing is
[15:12:09] <robertmaxrees> http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/07/microsoft-will-kill-support-for-ie-8-the-worlds-most-popular-desktop-browser-by-2016/ ! yessss
[15:12:37] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Still too far in the future :P
[15:12:37] <METEMEDO> i'm calling the function on first load, and then on change. when it loads, everything works correctly, but onchange it doesn't update the fields
[15:13:05] <METEMEDO> and it's reaching the inner for
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> systemfault it's enough for me.
[15:18:14] <METEMEDO> systemfault: i think i know what it is
[15:18:15] <METEMEDO> :D
[15:19:24] <METEMEDO> systemfault: do you see that first slideUp in the function? it cleans the fields AFTER the slideUp is complete. but the remaining code of the function is executed meanwhile
[15:19:54] <METEMEDO> so it's executed BEFORE the slideUp finishes,
[15:20:05] <METEMEDO> and cleans the field
[15:20:12] <METEMEDO> it's obviously it
[15:20:13] <METEMEDO> pff
[15:20:47] <robertmaxrees> the code wasn't waiting for the animation to complete since animations are async.
[15:21:53] <METEMEDO> but ofc
[15:22:05] <METEMEDO> i think its the fatigue :D
[15:24:26] <METEMEDO> ty all
[15:33:27] <damarusama> I'm able to pull the data-ammount but doesn't seems to be able to put that data in an array
[15:33:30] <damarusama> http://jsbin.com/pusafohu/1/edit
[15:34:03] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: working from previous code you sent me
[15:34:35] <robertmaxrees> damarusama because myData isn't an array.
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/vaxojopa/1/edit
[15:38:19] <damarusama> O_O looking for a difference
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not doing that second for loop.
[15:40:04] <damarusama> ._. hum ok... massive brain disfunction at this point for me
[15:42:51] <damarusama> thanks a lot ;D
[15:55:09] <dglambert> hey hey
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[15:56:16] <dglambert> so my widget is nearly done
[15:56:23] <dglambert> debugging it now
[15:56:58] <dglambert> dealing with css issues
[16:30:27] <vsmith> Hey guys so obviously i have no idea what i am dong because nothing is working .  Can some one look at my code once more.  I have wrote in steps what i am trying to do in the code comments. http://pastie.org/9454083
[16:30:27] <vsmith> The location where the code is running is here http://199.167.200.52/~ccanvas/special-offers/
[16:31:04] <robertmaxrees> vsmith look at your console.
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting an error on load.
[16:32:12] <vsmith> okay
[16:33:18] <vsmith> so the error is gone but it is still not doing what i need robertmaxrees
[16:33:49] <robertmaxrees> let me reload.
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> so on cases like Colored Commando Cloth Remnants you want the "add to cart" to be disabled until you change the corresponding select?
[16:36:10] <jeffreylevesque> could someone explain to me the purpose of `window.AudioRecorder = AudioRecorder;`
[16:36:12] <jeffreylevesque> in https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/f77c657a2ee1e4f706a87fd7627a88ca43bcf6ba/src/js/audioRecorder.js#L165
[16:36:24] <vsmith> robertmaxrees yes
[16:36:31] <robertmaxrees> vsmith if (el == "No Color") { should be if (el.val() == "No Color") {
[16:36:55] <vsmith> rebertmaxrees let me try this
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> also, $("input[type=Submit]").attr("disabled", "disabled"); is too generic.
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> you have to give that one context.
[16:38:19] <vsmith> Okay so i will add a new selector as well robertmaxrees
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> except that alone won't work.
[16:39:36] <vsmith> yeah now all inputs are disabled
[16:40:27] <robertmaxrees> right.  you need to move that if logic into the each.
[16:40:30] <robertmaxrees> one sec i'll show you.
[16:40:44] <vsmith> okay
[16:43:16] <damarusama> anything fancier that if (foo > 15) { foo = 15} ;
[16:44:10] <robertmaxrees> vsmith woah why are you using such an old version of jquery?
[16:44:29] <robertmaxrees> you have two version on here/.
[16:45:00] <vsmith> really i had not checked recently
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> yes, you've got 1.10.1 and 1.3.2
[16:46:08] <vsmith> I must check may be a wordpress plugin coming in
[16:47:07] <hugo_moss> im havin a problem with jquery-ui, it keeps shaking elements next to it
[16:47:13] <hugo_moss> let me post a jsfiddle
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> vsmith http://fixee.org/paste/7xjnalc/
[16:47:24] <robertmaxrees> this gets you partly there.
[16:47:37] <robertmaxrees> when you get your version of jquery updated use .prop() instead of .attr()
[16:48:24] <CapnKlutch> Hey guys can anyone give me some feedback on my first open source app. https://github.com/CapnKlutch/twitterCard
[16:48:37] <vsmith> okay robertmaxrees thanks i am gonna update and try now
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> vsmith still need to build the logic to NOT disable the button if there's no dropdown, but this should get you started.
[16:49:13] <Silent> Hi :)
[16:49:49] <vsmith> Okay thanks
[16:49:50] <Silent> I'm trying to make one picture fade into another, and it works fine except the animation sometimes repeats itself if I mouse-over multiple times
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch https://github.com/CapnKlutch/twitterCard/blob/master/twitterCard/twitterCard.js#L9-L10 <- that's a little dangerous.
[16:50:02] <Silent> I've tried lots of different things, not sure how to fix it
[16:50:11] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ silverdiamond
[16:50:11] <b-ot> silverdiamond: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:50:14] <robertmaxrees> err, silent.
[16:50:15] <Silent> Please help, here's my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/AdvMutant/9vLvsxx0/
[16:50:17] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete.
[16:50:22] <robertmaxrees> yaaay fiddles.
[16:50:41] <Silent> robertmaxrees, I had it all along, just wanted to explain the problem first :)
[16:50:52] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch var data = data; is totally unnecessary on line 36 in that file.
[16:50:53] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees why do you say so?
[16:51:30] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch ah those are local files nvm ignore me.
[16:52:11] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/CapnKlutch/twitterCard/blob/master/twitterCard/twitterCard.js#L14-L15 -> use .prop(), not attr
[16:53:00] <Silent> It's all because of this stupid double fade call
[16:53:03] <robertmaxrees> use .done() instead of success
[16:53:19] <Silent> If I only had only 1 call it would work just fine
[16:53:25] <robertmaxrees> Silent because it's queuing each animation.
[16:54:06] <robertmaxrees> woah jquery 1.4.4
[16:54:23] <Silent> robertmaxrees, I tried using this page but it didn't work http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/
[16:54:28] <CapnKlutch> .done() where? robertmaxrees
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch instead of success: in your ajax
[16:54:40] <Silent> Also I just grabbed some fiddle that had jquery and forked it
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> one sec
[16:56:37] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees how? when I change it to done it doesn't work
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch it's a callback - .done() - you chain it, not just drop it in.
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> !j jquery ajax done
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery ajax done
[16:57:06] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[16:58:43] <robertmaxrees> check that out.
[17:03:01] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, Check it out now, any other tips
[17:03:31] <robertmaxrees> clean up your whitespace a bit.
[17:04:04] <CapnKlutch> I was thinking just to minify it, what do you think
[17:04:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change what you should do with your source.
[17:04:36] <CapnKlutch> Like what do you suggest I change
[17:04:43] <robertmaxrees> like whenever you have an inline handler, put the function() { part on the saem line as the binding - jQuery("twitter").hover(function() {
[17:05:09] <robertmaxrees> avoid long multiline strings for html - build fragments if you can and work against those.
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> your if (window.jQuery) { and its if are unnecessary imo - make jquery a requirement and leave it at that.
[17:07:00] <robertmaxrees> prefix variables that hold jquery objects with $.  squash all your variable declarations at the top of each function
[17:07:15] <robertmaxrees> instead of jQuery("twitter").hover(function() { you should really use .on('mouseenter', function(){});
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> what you have know binds two listeners.
[17:08:33] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, thanks ill get on that, what do you think of the app in general
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> use the widget pattern instead.
[17:08:46] <CapnKlutch> widget pattern?
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> err, plugin attern one sec.
[17:09:39] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[17:10:01] <robertmaxrees> have the dev decide what the selector should be, etc.
[17:14:22] <CapnKlutch> I just want to make it so easy so that even if the dev doesn't know jQuery they can just add the script to the header and not have to worry about anything
[17:14:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not your concern.
[17:15:05] <CapnKlutch> will it make any performance inprovement
[17:15:10] <CapnKlutch> improvements
[17:15:16] <robertmaxrees> it'll reduce filesize and remove a check.
[17:15:19] <rOOb> Hello all. I'm having issues using jquery and bootstrapvalidator. http://pastebin.com/32mz4V2Z
[17:15:23] <rOOb> Can anyone take a quick look?
[17:16:35] <robertmaxrees> rOOb make sure you have jquery loaded first and that the plugin is loading second then your code third.
[17:16:52] <robertmaxrees> check in your page.
[17:17:09] <ddod> Can anyone help me understand passing a dictionary as HTTP parameters? I'm wondering what kind of encoding it uses, how it would look in an ajax call, and how to craft the url from a JSON object. Here's how what I'm talking about looks in cURL: curl http://api.com/endpoint -d something[attribute]=value -d something[another_attribute]=another_value
[17:17:31] <rOOb> robbyoconnor I'm concatinating all the js. I verfied inside the concatinated file that it goes: jquery, boostrap, bootstrapvalidator, my own code
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> rOOb wrong person?
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> rOOb also make sure your page is valid and your selectors are good.
[17:17:55] <rOOb> robertmaxrees haha why yes! Sorry!
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> ddod check out learn.jquery.com.
[17:18:02] <rOOb> robertmaxrees ^^
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> ddod also, javascript doesn't have "dictionaries", just objects.
[17:18:29] <rOOb> ddod?
[17:18:36] <robertmaxrees> talking to somebody else ;)
[17:18:52] <rOOb> Ahh. My bad!
[17:18:58] <ddod> robertmaxrees: Thanks, I know jquery and js pretty well, but I don't know the syntax I'm seeing in curl and how to apply that to what I know in jquery and js
[17:19:08] <ddod> That's what I'm asking about
[17:19:10] <rOOb> Ohh. I see now. I just switched irc clients and still getting used this one :)
[17:19:25] <rOOb> Apparently I'm having difficulties following conversations ;)
[17:20:24] <teear> converse more
[17:20:53] <rOOb> Looks like my selectors are good. I just verified that I'm selecting the right class for my form.
[17:20:59] <rOOb> Still the same error.
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> ddod check out serializeArray() for forms.
[17:21:49] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, .on( "mouseover",
[17:21:49] <CapnKlutch>   function() { not working
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> basically, you built up a string of key/value pairs for query strings - api.com/page?param1=value1&param2=value2
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch mouseenter
[17:22:34] <ddod> robertmaxrees: That works for single items as params, but what if I need sub-attributes of a single parameter, like in the curl example I gave?
[17:22:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not really feasible.
[17:23:02] <robertmaxrees> unless you do it in the post body.
[17:23:09] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, Still not working?
[17:23:10] <ddod> yeah, that's what it's doing
[17:23:23] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch dunno then.  should work just fine.
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> ddod you can just send the JSON - it gets sent as text.  you then use a JSON parser on the other end.
[17:24:25] <CapnKlutch> http://pastebin.com/VhDk99qB take a look
[17:24:28] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees,
[17:24:41] <ddod> robertmaxrees: not if I don't control the server
[17:25:00] <robertmaxrees> ddod then back up - what are you actually trying to do?
[17:25:08] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch onle one function, not two.
[17:25:15] <ddod> interact with an api
[17:25:20] <robertmaxrees> ddod what API?'
[17:25:28] <ddod> the stripe api in this case
[17:25:55] <ddod> https://stripe.com/docs/api/curl#create_card you can see there's an alternate "use dictionary" option
[17:26:08] <ddod> but no description of how, but I got it working with the example curl I posted earlier
[17:26:21] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, Greatworks like a charm
[17:26:38] <robertmaxrees> ddod https://stripe.com/docs/api/node#create_card <- this is how you'd do it with javascript.
[17:26:40] <robertmaxrees> in node.
[17:26:54] * vinex08 retying try.jquery ...
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> ddod you'd need to build that object yourself, but it's not hard to do at all.
[17:29:04] <robertmaxrees> nevermind you're asking the same thing in #javascript.  good luck!
[17:29:11] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i got to band rehearsal.  enjoy folks.
[17:29:11] <hugo_moss> is anybody else experiencing screw sh*t with chrome
[17:29:16] <hugo_moss> i inspect a div
[17:29:20] <hugo_moss> and it highlights the wrong div
[19:04:08] <ekcolysp> hey guys got a question about the (fucntion() {...}) clause in the page
[19:04:24] <ekcolysp> trying to get a better understanding of what it does, but i am somewhat confusede
[19:04:27] <ekcolysp> confused*
[19:04:34] <ekcolysp> can anyone offer an explanation?
[19:10:24] <frickettz> Anyone familiar with jQuery UI?  Trying to use Tabs but due to my layout, the nav list I want to use to trigger the tabs isn't a direct decendant?
[19:24:20] <suga> how to loop++ number inside of append() method?
[19:24:29] <suga> can i do this ?
[19:25:08] <suga> a = 1;
[20:16:56] <sammych> jQM question: on a convertible device (windows 8/keyboard + touch) the swipe* events only occur for touch?
[20:17:11] <sammych> I know for non-touch, you can trigger it with a mouse
[20:17:20] <sammych> but can we have it both ways?
[20:17:38] <arschmitz> sammych: sadly yes for now
[20:17:52] <arschmitz> it will be fixed when we switch to using pointer events
[20:18:12] <sammych> 1.5?
[20:18:16] <arschmitz> sammych: which i am working on as we speak
[20:18:21] <arschmitz> sammych: thats the plan
[20:18:32] <sammych> what's the ETA on that?
[20:18:53] <sammych> might have to put in a little button on the left header, then :(
[20:20:14] <sammych> I think chrome is overloading the swipe action with history (back/foward)
[20:20:53] <arschmitz> no eta
[20:20:59] <sammych> actually, touchpunch is having a fit
[20:21:05] <arschmitz> and chrome has issues with swipe bigtime
[20:21:15] <sammych> don't think I need it anyway
[21:35:20] <artichoke> if i call var options = $('select option'); i get an Object[option,option] back. how can I add another option to the front of the array so that it beomces Object[option,option,option] ?
[22:01:25] <kirua> hi
[22:01:27] <kirua> why http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/1dyo49ss/
[22:01:32] <kirua> doesn't work as expected ?
[22:02:20] <Uhkis> your options variable is not set
[22:06:37] <kirua> i tried to set an option but still nothing
[22:06:50] <kirua> maybe you can check with me, this is where it comes from : http://ethaizone.github.io/Bootstrap-Confirmation/
[22:26:25] <bl4ckdu5t> everyone sleeping?

[22:26:52] <bl4ckdu5t> got this little issue http://jsfiddle.net/bl4ckdu5t/db1r2v3o/2/
[22:27:04] <bl4ckdu5t> I hope I find someone awake to help
[22:28:50] <Uhkis> people please check your console
[22:44:05] <bl4ckdu5t> Uhkis: I see the error but it doesn't look like I have an error in the code
[22:44:52] <Uhkis> except for the obvious syntax error?
[22:46:18] <bl4ckdu5t> Uhkis: found
[22:46:24] <bl4ckdu5t> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/bl4ckdu5t/db1r2v3o/3/
[22:46:37] <bl4ckdu5t> but the function still isn't working
[22:47:24] <bl4ckdu5t> I never used jquery plugin authoring function. Always did it the javascript way. Thought it'd be nicer to try this
[22:51:15] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:52:06] <mcsilvio> hi there. cant find a bootstrap chan. question: any ideas on showing two columns on a large display, but only one on small dislays (and switching between the two)? please and thanks
[22:53:30] <damarusama> mcsilvio: review the col-md and col-sm notation for your elements
[22:55:42] <bl4ckdu5t> mcsilvio: #twitter-bootstrap
[22:55:49] <mcsilvio> damarusama: thanks, but im a little unclear. do you mean, for col-sm i should do something like col-sm-12 and col-sm-0, and use jquery to reverse them when switching?
[22:55:57] <mcsilvio> bl4ckdu5t: thank you
[22:57:02] <bl4ckdu5t> :)
