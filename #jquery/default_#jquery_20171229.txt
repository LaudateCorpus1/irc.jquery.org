[01:07:54] <_zoggy_> I'm running jquery 1.7.2 and wanted to upgrade to latest 1.12.4 I used jquery-migrate 1.4.1 plugin and it didnt show any warning/issues. I then remove the jquery-migrate to find issues like .live was removed on 1.9+ and other things that didnt work..
[01:08:23] <_zoggy_> (and yes it showed that jquery-migrate was being loaded just fine)
[01:33:30] <_zoggy_> ok if i use jquery-migrate.min it loads but doesnt show any warnings. if i dont use the minified version i see the warnings

[03:53:33] <surferboy> Replace following block,
[03:53:33] <surferboy> $('body').on('click', 'a[href]', function() {
[03:53:33] <surferboy> 	window.location = this.href;
[03:53:33] <surferboy> });
[03:53:33] <surferboy> with,

[10:32:51] <z1haze> anyone using jquery-ui for dialogs in here? I have a problem where some dialogs use generated button bars at the bottom, and some dont. but if I open a modal that generates buttons, then close it.. and open another modal that does not supposed to have those buttons gerneated, they are still there. and thats no good :\
[10:33:05] <z1haze> I've switched from calling dialog('close') to dialog('destroy') and still nothing
[12:26:05] <pippuccio76> hi , sorry for english , i have 2 select , when i select one option of select 1 i want select the next element on select 2 :https://jsfiddle.net/c9r6px8s/1/
[12:59:13] <z1haze> How can I find the bare minimum that's required for jquery-ui dialogs?
[12:59:28] <z1haze> like what is 'widget'
[13:00:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/download/
[13:00:38] <robertmaxrees> you can build your custom downlaod - this will also tell you what you're asking.
[13:01:07] <robertmaxrees> uncheck "Toggle All" and then click a module to figure out what it relies on.
[13:06:19] <z1haze> ok so even if im using npm, i can use this to tell me which modules i need?
[13:06:38] <z1haze> I'm in the process of upgrading to 1.12 from 1.11 and there's quit a bit of changes.. like the dialog ui isnt even there anymore
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to just do a custom build?
[13:07:31] <z1haze> yeah, I guess. I'm just trying to require the modules I need
[13:07:41] <robertmaxrees> instead of the whole shebang, yeah?
[13:07:45] <z1haze> yep
[13:07:52] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[13:07:59] <z1haze> I have a vendor pack in my webpack config
[13:08:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i might look at how they build it themselves and go from there.
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> you could always include just, say, core.
[13:08:56] <gambl0re> hey
[13:09:00] <robertmaxrees> hi gambl0re
[13:09:24] <z1haze> I am doing that now, but looking at the file in node_modules it says the file is depracated
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> z1haze which file?
[13:09:39] <z1haze> core.js
[13:09:51] <z1haze> / This file is deprecated in 1.12.0 to be removed in 1.13
[13:10:20] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> node_modules is downloaded from npm
[13:10:44] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what that's referencing
[13:10:58] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/89af4c292eaa5fc1c83437ca71085264dcbef34a/ui/core.js
[13:10:59] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:11:01] <z1haze> well yea, its the library though
[13:12:08] <z1haze> I'm just trying to help this site move toward an efficient direction
[13:12:13] <z1haze> every little bit helps
[13:12:16] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> this is probably much more of what you want to look at.
[13:13:02] <z1haze> kinda
[13:13:05] <z1haze> but for example
[13:13:25] <z1haze> lets say I only want these things: dialog, datepicket, tooltips, tabs
[13:13:55] <z1haze> do I need the ui/widgets file + the individual widgets, or do i just need the individual widgets + core? its not easy figured out
[13:14:26] <z1haze> or do i even need core at all?
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to include core.
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> not familiar with the jqui build process tho.
[13:15:06] <robertmaxrees> so you'd probably have to experiment and figure that part out.
[13:15:09] <z1haze> yeah
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.12.1&components=111111011111101000011111010000010000000000000000 fwiw
[13:15:31] <z1haze> we've been using it i guess for years, but Im working on a pretty large ticket now which will give me the opportunity to revamp the whole dialog/jq-ui experience on the site
[13:15:56] <z1haze> we have a lot of things happening on the site that jq-ui seems like it could handle, but we are either reinventing the wheel, or just importing another package to do it
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:17:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty common problem.
[13:17:54] <robertmaxrees> although i'd be careful if you're mixing+matching libraries to do this stuff.
[13:18:06] <robertmaxrees> like bootstrap + jqui
[13:18:18] <z1haze> we dont use bs, but yeah I get it.
[13:18:31] <z1haze> I'm only been on this project for about 4 months, so I'm still feeling it out. its rather a mess
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  i know that feeling all too wel.
[13:18:53] <robertmaxrees> *well
[13:50:03] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ line 68...do you remember that function?
[14:03:05] <z1haze> So, I want to pass a sort of a callback function to the open option of this jquery-ui dialog, but the function takes parameters, and one of them is $(this) but the context needs to be of the calling function.. how can I do that?
[14:04:34] <z1haze> here's an example of my layout http://dpaste.com/317JYX1
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i can see what it does.
[14:05:16] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[14:06:55] <robertmaxrees> z1haze the open method doesn't really take arguments in the first place...  are you just trying to run something after the dialog opens?
[14:07:17] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: I've installed ubuntu http://storage5.static.itmages.com/i/17/1229/h_1514574407_1641913_1db2abb17c.png
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 grats?
[14:07:37] <dimi1947> well..there is a problem with it...
[14:07:38] <Neo2> browser significantly faster works than in windows
[14:07:57] <dimi1947> imagine the following user flow
[14:08:16] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 'kay.
[14:08:48] <Neo2> I'll the fastest developer soon :)
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 erm, OS doesn't determine that, and i wouldn't be worried about speed.
[14:09:55] <z1haze> do what?
[14:10:09] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: no it faster works, try load sites where much javascripts, there impossible work in windows, here not exists antivirus, very light and fast
[14:10:10] <z1haze> nono, this is my open method
[14:10:33] <z1haze> basically, I need to initialize a bunch of events for each modal
[14:10:35] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: try to load this page https://www.freelancer.com/projects/graphic-design/set-hosting-install-idx-wordpress/
[14:10:36] <z1haze> each modal is different.
[14:10:48] <z1haze> so I need to pass in the function that needs to initialize
[14:10:50] <Neo2> in windows it's more than 10 seconds sometimes 20
[14:10:58] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 not for me.
[14:11:02] <z1haze> I juist dont know how to pass in the correct context of $(this)
[14:11:03] <dimi1947> the user clicks save the empty inputs are higlighted..IT FILLS the empty inputs and clicks again save...with the code as it is now the inputs remain highligthed...in order to remove the styling I concluded in this:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/18/ line 68
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze aaaah, and you're having issues binding context.
[14:11:37] <z1haze> in a.js I am passing in initSigninDialog (which is a function)
[14:11:52] <z1haze> i want that to execute in the open of the dialog.
[14:12:10] <z1haze> but the issue is that the context of the $(this) param that initSigninDialog needs needs be belong to b.js
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you can't use .bind() to change your `this`
[14:13:04] <z1haze> ?
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> z1haze your issue is 'this' doesn't point to the element, right?
[14:13:42] <z1haze> I think -- I have to re look at this, as so much is going to change since the last time i wrote this
[14:14:27] <robertmaxrees> so basically, 'this' doesn't point to the element any more - you can fix that with .bind()
[14:17:05] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i don't see a save button
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i'm really lost about what you're question is.
[14:17:50] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:click edit...then click the plus sign
[14:18:16] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, i still think this doesnt solve it though
[14:18:23] <dimi1947> do you see the save button now?
[14:18:27] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> what does this have to do with that particular function you mentioned?
[14:19:04] <z1haze> as per my paste, `open: initSigninDialog` takes arguments, but I want this to be a generic handler..
[14:19:28] <z1haze> so if this particular function has arguments, and one of the arguments has context $(this) needing to be of a different file, its no longer generic
[14:19:30] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:listen
[14:19:36] <robertmaxrees> z1haze right, you'll need to bind context manually.  check out the mdn article about it.
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 are you asking about the change you made to that function?
[14:20:12] <dimi1947> give me some time to explain pls
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> duder.
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> you're basically taking on way too much at once.
[14:20:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta break it down a bit.
[14:20:55] <dimi1947> if you click save the empty inputs are styled to inform the user....are we ok with that?
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> because you've basically defeated the entire point of that filter method call.
[14:21:31] <dimi1947> let me finish my readoning
[14:22:29] <dimi1947> are we ok with the above?
[14:23:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> let me break this down so you can better understand what's going on here.
[14:23:45] <dimi1947> no...I must finish my reasoning
[14:24:04] <robertmaxrees> you're misapplying filter there.
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[14:24:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hf9Lfpuy/
[14:24:40] <dimi1947> you do not give me the chance to explain....
[14:25:11] <robertmaxrees> so, the entire point of using filter with a callback is that you pass true or falser.
[14:25:13] <robertmaxrees> *false
[14:25:38] <robertmaxrees> not returning one or the other doens't make any sense.  you're basically using it as a weird each()
[14:25:52] <dimi1947> there is a problem with that code
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> right.  so let me show you the right way to approach the problem.
[14:26:24] <dimi1947> yes but you do not know what I want to do
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> yes i do.
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:26:45] <dimi1947> tell me...what I want to do?
[14:26:52] <robertmaxrees> you want to add/remove the error messaging when the user clicks save.
[14:26:59] <dimi1947> EXACTLY
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> the prior version never removed it from valid elements.
[14:27:11] <robertmaxrees> so let me show you the right way to do that.
[14:27:13] <dimi1947> EXACTLY
[14:27:15] <dimi1947> THX
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> chill out duder.
[14:27:44] <dimi1947> ok...I am in the proccess of chilling out
[14:27:57] <robertmaxrees> so, the hamfisted way to do it is https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hf9Lfpuy/1/
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> woops - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hf9Lfpuy/2/
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> but I'd probably change that a little to this instead: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hf9Lfpuy/3/
[14:29:57] <dimi1947> qquestion....
[14:30:07] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 btw that site you linked finishes it's total load in under 3 seconds for me.
[14:30:11] <dimi1947> why yours is better that the mine?
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 so
[14:30:38] <robertmaxrees> did you read any of the stuff i said before?
[14:30:49] <robertmaxrees> about the point of .filter()
[14:31:24] <dimi1947> I definitely read some staff but not related to filter
[14:31:39] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: probably you are not log in, and not see full pages with users, can use see there indians who has    left his bid?
[14:31:50] <Neo2> and not load chat
[14:31:54] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 lol
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 I said: so, the entire point of using filter with a callback is that you pass true or false.
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> not returning one or the other doens't make any sense.  you're basically using it as a weird each()
[14:32:26] <Neo2> for me it's not 3 - 5 seconds
[14:32:51] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 sounds like you had something up with your windows setup then.
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> but it's all good.  whatever works best for you.
[14:33:10] <robertmaxrees> that's the beauty of having options :)
[14:33:53] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: see how my page look http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/17/1229/h_1514576006_2824386_fb7e20c22a.png
[14:33:55] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what you were doing in yours was using the callback to perform some other action, which is a no-no.
[14:34:00] <Neo2> it's long page and there chat
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:33] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: set up nothing, windows just works slow, I have ssd and i5 cpu 8gb ram
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 filter should ONLY return true or false based on criteria for the element.
[14:34:50] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 pretty similar rig to my home machine.  i've never had performance issues like that.
[14:34:53] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:what is the cost of that no-no?
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 confusing the hell out of yourself and any other developers.
[14:35:15] <robertmaxrees> side effects that you aren't expecting.
[14:35:23] <dimi1947> hmmmm
[14:35:36] <robertmaxrees> if you want each(), use each()
[14:35:45] <robertmaxrees> but in this case, you're using filter.
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> which is the smarter way to do it.
[14:36:14] <robertmaxrees> the idea is you break your logic down into reusable parts and give them names.
[14:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that's what functions are for.
[14:36:49] <robertmaxrees> even if you only use the function once, giving it a clear name that says exactly what it does is a big deal.
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that make sense?
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:25:06] <freezo> Hi, why does not Interval works? --> https://jsfiddle.net/r5cedac2/53/
[17:25:57] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[17:26:56] <robertmaxrees> freezo you mean why isn't it waiting longer?
[17:27:12] <freezo> exacly :)
[17:27:55] <freezo> robertmaxrees it should wait 1514793600000
[17:28:21] <robertmaxrees> well for starters - milliseconds is going to be a string there.
[17:28:25] <robertmaxrees> you want a number
[17:29:02] <freezo> parseInt() ?
[17:29:09] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a good place to start.
[17:29:17] <robertmaxrees> also: choose something other than a window reload heh
[17:31:41] <freezo> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/r5cedac2/55/
[17:31:48] <robertmaxrees> also: your value is larger than the maximum allowed number
[17:31:55] <freezo> didnt seems to help with parseInt
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout uses a 32bit int under the hood, so the largest possible delay is 2147483647
[17:32:29] <freezo> oh, ok, thats why it not working :P
[17:32:37] <robertmaxrees> that's the other reason.
[17:32:41] <robertmaxrees> why are you using such a large number?
[17:33:20] <robertmaxrees> like, the largest number is almost 25 days.
[17:37:51] <freezo> oh, I missed to subtract the date with today, now it works :)
[17:38:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:38:21] <freezo> thx anyway, it was helpful! :)
[17:41:24] <robertmaxrees> absolutely
