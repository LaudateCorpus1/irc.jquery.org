[00:36:34] <robertmaxrees> goooooood evening #jquery
[06:03:28] <nikio_> https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html
[06:03:49] <nikio_> im reading how u can use  react to replace jquery
[06:04:04] <nikio_> on that page
[06:04:20] <nikio_> i dont see the benefit
[08:00:39] <Archelaus> nikio_ i know you linked it a while ago but react is in no way a replacement for jquery
[08:00:53] <nikio_> ofc it is
[08:01:05] <Archelaus> uh
[08:01:14] <Archelaus> what is jquery vs what is react
[08:01:26] <Archelaus> I mean, they're completely different things
[08:01:31] <nikio_> lol
[08:01:58] <nikio_> then you should read about them a bit more
[08:02:04] <Archelaus> That page you linked literally says "focusing on integration with jQuery and Backbone,"
[08:02:17] <Archelaus> Not "how react replaces jquery" it's talking about using them together
[08:02:38] <nikio_> i didnt say i wanna replace my jqeury with react
[08:02:44] <nikio_> i said i wanna improve it using react
[08:03:13] <Archelaus> I know you didn't, you said "im reading how u can use  react to replace jquery" after linking that page and then "on that page"
[08:03:30] <Archelaus> and then I open the page up, it's nothing to do with how react replaces jquery
[08:03:41] <Archelaus> Just about how they may compliment each other
[08:04:34] <nikio_> dont be nitpicking, when u use the word replace
[08:04:41] <nikio_> it can mean replace certain parts
[08:05:13] <Archelaus> I'm not nitpicking, you can't say one thing while meaning something completely different and expect strangers to understand what you're talking about
[08:06:46] <nikio_> i would understand people who phrased their problem that way
[08:07:04] <nikio_> i guess we are all different
[08:07:25] <Archelaus> I mean you can't really be objective when it comes to understanding something you, yourself said, because you knew the intent behind the statement
[08:08:06] <nikio_> the best teachers are those that understand the pupils not those that try to impose a way of teaching
[08:08:14] <Archelaus> the fuck are you talking about
[08:08:43] <Archelaus> my original point was what you said was incorrect, you're now saying that's not what you meant so fine, but don't act like it's me not understanding which was the problem
[08:09:17] <nikio_> i dont even remember what i said, and i cant read it because it was written from my phone
[08:09:26] <nikio_> so i cant even join the debate in semantics
[08:09:41] <nikio_> im more worried about trying to improve my jquery SPA
[08:09:50] <nikio_> its written purely in  jquery
[08:09:58] <Archelaus> I pasted it up there for you just before you called me out for being nitpicky, not that far up
[08:10:03] <nikio_> especially the rendering parts are a bit ugly because of it
[08:11:00] <nikio_> even the react official guide as a section on how you can replace jquery with react
[08:11:33] <Archelaus> The article you linked is talking about integrating them together
[08:11:37] <nikio_> https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html
[08:11:49] <Archelaus> "integrating-with-other-libraries" yeah
[08:11:49] <nikio_> https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#replacing-string-based-rendering-with-react
[08:12:00] <nikio_> note how they use the word replac
[08:12:29] <nikio_> again, its a pitiful debate in semantics
[08:12:41] <nikio_> when using replace you could mean replace partially
[08:12:43] <nikio_> or replace the whole
[08:13:05] <Archelaus> I don't think it's a debate in semantics, when you say you can replace sugar with shit in a recipe you would think to still add 99% sugar and just a little shit, would you?
[08:13:15] <nikio_> lol
[08:14:47] <nikio_> <lol></lol>
[08:16:17] <nikio_> do you think that article is promoting good coding practice
[08:16:18] <nikio_> ?
[08:16:36] <nikio_> i mean: http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/08/24/integrate-reactjs-into-jquery-webapps/
[08:17:03] <nikio_> im trying to improve my own
[08:18:02] <nikio_> i wish i would be working with someone better than me so i could learn :/ it sucks being lonely at the top in a company
[08:19:07] <nikio_> i tried angular but i dont like it
[08:20:43] <nikio_> slipchu, are you still there?
[10:29:12] <nopea> is there a way to get the height of all child div elements from a parent div element?
[11:13:34] <pavonia> nopea: You can get all child elements and sum up their widths
[11:13:39] <pavonia> Err heights
[11:20:17] <nopea> pavonia: thanks... actually I was away working on this, and that is what I just did.  Looped thru the children and got the highest element value and then applied that
[11:55:38] <muqtada> help
[11:55:57] <muqtada> help $(document).ready

[12:08:34] <Ridley5> hi all
[12:08:52] <Ridley5> retrieving POST Data from PHP call to Ajax
[12:09:10] <Ridley5> srry
[12:09:18] <Ridley5> i have some trouble retrieving POST Data from PHP call to Ajax
[12:09:37] <Ridley5> i inserted an input box for  gettin the userphone number in the PHP page,
[12:09:48] <Ridley5> https://pastebin.com/m6RHN7FE
[12:11:04] <nikio_> from php call to ajax ?
[12:11:33] <Ridley5> yes nikio_
[12:11:58] <Ridley5> from PHP to JS ?
[12:12:02] <Ridley5> :S
[12:14:22] <nikio_> maybe you mean from an ajax call to to the php code?
[12:16:05] <Ridley5> that is nikio_ !
[12:16:49] <Ridley5> i'm getting all the value, only the userphone are not working
[12:18:11] <nikio_> did you try clearing browser cache
[12:18:34] <nikio_> also check if the variable is not empty
[12:19:08] <nikio_> sometimes some frameworks /languages disallow empty / null post values
[12:20:46] <nikio_> it could also be the php cache
[12:21:03] <nikio_> use chrome dev tools to see if the post value is being sent
[12:21:17] <nikio_> ctrl + shift + j
[12:21:25] <Ridley5> the variable is empty nikio_
[12:21:31] <Ridley5> i checked
[12:21:40] <nikio_> try with a constant
[12:21:47] <Ridley5> the userphone value is not submitting
[12:21:53] <nikio_> ok
[12:22:01] <nikio_> you mean
[12:22:24] <nikio_> the raw request doesnt hv it?
[12:22:51] <nikio_> check inthe chrome dev tools network tab under headers-> form data
[12:23:07] <nikio_> clear cache
[12:23:10] <Ridley5> ok i check rieght now
[12:23:17] <Ridley5> *right
[13:11:11] <Ridley5> i got it nikio_ there was two 2 input text with same id
[14:22:37] <ajayns> Hey I'd like to contribute to the JQuery community
[14:22:39] <ajayns> Where do I start
[15:10:49] <sine0> folks, would 3.2.1 cater for a lib that requires 1.11
[15:19:49] <sine0> one at a time please
[15:38:28] <Charles__> hello
[15:38:51] <Charles__> i have one problem
[15:39:08] <Charles__> my mather is dead
[15:39:25] <sine0> what is a mather. is it a cross dressing dad?
[16:16:50] <alexweissman> sine0: I believe jQuery tries very hard to be backwards-compatible
[16:16:58] <alexweissman> some would say, to a fault
[17:22:06] <sine0> ok cool thanks
[20:47:44] <nikio_> ok Ridley5
[20:47:56] <nikio_> im gna   watchblack mirror
[21:23:39] <WhirledPress> If I have an element that is inside of a scrollable element, is it safe to assume the offsetParent() would be the best place to start looking for the scrollable ancestor? or are they related?

[23:00:56] <pavonia> Use replace()
[23:09:05] <Woet> jak2000: have you considered googling and trying instead of spamming this channel?
[23:09:10] <Woet> jak2000: it's not even relevant to jQuery.
[23:13:28] <jak2000> pavonia i try: wstr.replace(':::','\n'); <----- and not break into a new line, also i try:  wstr.replace(':::','<br>'); too not break into a new line.... in last case i see "TEMPERATURA : 4.000<br>% DE ÁCIDO LÁCTICO : 14.400<br>pH: 6.810<br>NEUTRALIZANTE:  - <br>BETALACTAMICOS:  - <br>TETRACICLINA:  - <br>AFLATOXINA:  - <br>ADULTERANTE:  - <br>PRUEBA DE ALCOHOL:  - <br>%GRASA: 3.740<br>%

[23:14:14] <jak2000> also Thanks for your HELP
[23:14:17] <Woet> jak2000: maybe you should read the documentation and look at the examples
[23:14:36] <jak2000> the value is replaced... but not break on a new line not know why
[23:15:38] <Woet> jak2000: reproduce on https://jsfiddle.net
[23:18:54] <jak2000> i try...
[23:37:14] <jak2000> Woet: first why not change the value of the value of myClass not changed? https://jsfiddle.net/atg5m6ym/8626/
[23:38:01] <Woet> jak2000: because you didn't check the console for errors
