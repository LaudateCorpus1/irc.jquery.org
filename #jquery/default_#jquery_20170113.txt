[02:56:34] <linuxson> Hey guys....Anyone worked with charts.js yet? Trying to figure out how to remove that irritatin little white dot in the middle of the pie chart. Have successfully removed the dividing lines, but that dot still remains
[03:37:00] <Cork> linuxson: charts.js from what framework?
[03:37:08] <Cork> there are a lot of them out there
[04:07:41] <sl33k> hey here
[04:11:52] <erry> Hi all, I have a problem with tabs
[04:11:59] <erry> It's loading AJAX when it shouldn't be
[04:12:12] <erry> my links are all href="#SomeElement"
[04:12:27] <erry> I looked into the source where it does return anchor.hash.length > 1 && anchorUrl === locationUrl;
[04:12:40] <erry> tl;dr 'anchorUrl' ends up being 'mypage/'
[04:12:46] <erry> and locationUrl is 'mypage' (no ending /)
[04:12:50] <erry> so it thinks it's an  ajax url
[04:12:53] <erry> how can i fix this?
[04:22:20] <erry> maybe i need a newer version of tabs/jquery?
[04:24:37] <erry> oh this is something to do with the base tag
[04:26:00] <sl33k> hey here
[04:26:13] <sl33k> Is there a document or body event I can listen too when the page lenght changes?
[04:27:54] <erry> 'page length'?
[04:35:28] <Cork> sl33k: no, not an event there is the mutation listeners, but be aware that they are quite new and not supported in all browsers
[04:35:59] <Cork> also it is quite expensive so you should use it as a last resource, it is much better to trigger on the function doing the change
[04:40:48] <Assault> Hi. I need to save a value in an img tag so I can retrieve it later. How can this be done?
[04:41:30] <Cork> Assault: .data()
[04:41:41] <Assault> yeah thats what i googled too
[04:42:06] <Assault> but i'm finding mixed resultsa about the syntax..
[04:42:49] <Assault> so i do var myImg = document.getElementById('myImageID');
[04:43:15] <Assault> then I do myImg.data("value", 69); right?
[04:43:41] <Cork> $(myImg).data()
[04:45:29] <Assault> ah
[04:45:48] <Assault> that seems to work, thanks Cork!
[04:46:04] <AdamPDotty> $(Cork)
[05:06:58] <snfgf> HEY
[05:07:00] <snfgf> guys
[05:07:27] <snfgf> i want to respond to a change to any of the fields in my form
[05:07:44] <snfgf> each field has a class and that works fine for all of them, EXCEP, <select>
[05:08:12] <snfgf> $('.my_fields').on('input change')
[05:09:22] <snfgf> erm, hello
[05:11:23] <Cork> snfgf: change fires when the select loses focus (at latest)
[05:12:24] <Cork> also you prob want to bind it on the form instead $('form').on('input select', ':input', func)
[05:12:35] <snfgf> got it thanks :D
[05:12:38] <Cork> that way you don't have to add one event handler for each element
[05:13:08] <Cork> if that doesn't work, make a jsfiddle.net showing the problem
[06:40:36] <dglambert> morning
[08:12:36] <anexit> Anyone know why this takes forever;
[08:12:49] <anexit> https://hastebin.com/mifiniloze.scala
[08:13:04] <anexit> suppose to scale the 10MB pictures but it downloads the entire thing
[08:26:46] <Cork> anexit: <img> doesn't scale an image
[08:26:54] <Cork> it renders the image at a specific resolution
[08:27:09] <Cork> meaning the entire 10mb image is needed locally for the browser to render it
[08:27:26] <Cork> anexit: if you want thumbnails or something like that you need to scale it server side
[08:28:44] <Uhkis> anexit: your problem has nothing to do with jquery and if the image is bigger than that 200x300, the problem is in the backend
[08:56:12] <anexit> Okay, Thanks!
[10:16:18] <supsup> question: I can get Background images from stylesheets with JavaScript/Jquery,  but how do I get embedded styles on a page background images?
[10:20:41] <btrey> I'm attempting to duplicate a row in a table.
[10:20:45] <btrey>    var rows = $('.edit_inventory_table tr');
[10:20:47] <btrey>    var cells = rows[2].find('td');
[10:21:48] <btrey> This results in a row being inserted which contains the HTML as a literal string - <td> etc is displayed in the browser rather than interpreted by the browser.
[10:22:15] <btrey>    rows[1].after($(cells).prop('outerHTML'));
[10:37:29] <shoky> btrey:  uh use .eq(2)  not [2]   if you want to run jquery methods on it
[10:38:53] <shoky> btrey: and .clone() instead of .prop('outerHTML')
[10:39:04] <shoky> btrey: heh, and don't insert <td>'s as siblings of <tr>'s
[10:42:04] <btrey> Thanks, shoky.
[12:25:23] <duch_kazatel> weee
[13:24:03] <rjCousineau> Hello, I'm trying to return html back via ajax, but I want to also send an error message.  if I use JSON I can't get properly encode all the HTML.....  i'm trying to do this:  $.ajax({ success: function(data){ //handle an error, or $('#result').html(data) })
[13:24:44] <rjCousineau> Does anyone know how I have an if statement in the success function, like:  if(!data.message){ $('#result').html(data.html) } ???
[13:25:00] <shoky> rjCousineau: you can
[13:25:00] <rjCousineau> *how I can have an if statement..
[13:25:11] <duch_kazatel> you can. just put it in there
[13:25:40] <rjCousineau> but then in php, i need to figure out how to put HTML into a json
[13:25:40] <shoky> rjCousineau: if the server responds with valid json, and a valid content-type json header (or you use dataType:'json' for $.ajax call, or $.getJSON )
[13:25:58] <duch_kazatel> rjCousineau you should use client-side templating instead for taht.
[13:26:32] <rjCousineau> duch_kazatel: not an option for me..
[13:26:55] <rjCousineau> ok. lets say I can't use JSON because I can't get HTML into json..  is there another way?
[13:27:21] <duch_kazatel> you can respond with html.
[13:27:21] <shoky> XML? :)
[13:27:26] <duch_kazatel> or xml
[13:27:29] <duch_kazatel> or whatever you want.
[13:27:34] <duch_kazatel> it's all a string at the end of the day (shrug)
[13:28:15] <rjCousineau> hmm
[13:28:49] <shoky> i barely know any php but i can still remember something like json_encode( array( message => 'foo', data: '<foo/>' ) )  ;p
[13:29:20] <duch_kazatel> heh
[13:29:23] <shoky> so it can't be that hard :S *joins shrug*
[13:29:28] <rjCousineau> yeaa.. in php I need to parse the php using a require_once() function.. its not wanting to parse when $html = require_once('file.php');
[13:29:39] <rjCousineau> ok, i'll go that route..
[13:29:57] <duch_kazatel> probably has to do with return types buuuut who knows.
[13:30:08] <rjCousineau> thanks for your help, much appreciated
[13:30:39] <rjCousineau> dataType: 'json' ?
[13:30:50] <shoky> dataType: 'json' !
[13:30:53] <duch_kazatel> you generally don't need to worry about that.
[13:31:59] <rjCousineau> is $.parseJSON(data) required if i'm using dataType: 'json' ?
[13:32:06] <shoky> nop
[13:32:11] <rjCousineau> cool
[13:32:44] <shoky> also $.parseJSON is never required :P there's JSON.parse
[13:33:07] <rjCousineau> in jQuery?
[13:33:13] <shoky> in js
[13:33:39] <rjCousineau> same thing
[13:33:48] <shoky> lol... so wrong.
[13:33:54] <rjCousineau> i mean, $.parseJSON is the same thing as JSON.parse
[13:33:58] <shoky> ah
[13:34:02] <shoky> true that
[13:34:20] <rjCousineau> i wonder why it exists..
[13:34:30] <shoky> JSON.parse didn't always exist iirc
[13:34:31] <rjCousineau> There must be a significant difference
[13:34:33] <rjCousineau> ohh
[13:34:35] <shoky> old IE etc
[13:35:06] <rjCousineau> js is finally catching up
[13:35:23] <shoky> heh, caught up with that one long ago
[13:35:27] <shoky> (relatively)
[13:37:59] <rjCousineau> This still doens't make sense..
[13:39:02] <duch_kazatel> js has been "caught up" on JSON for a loooong time,.
[13:39:19] <rjCousineau> index.php has $data = json_decode($json);  then if($data->message){ //do jquery } echo $data->html;  ?? because in $data->html i have $( function(){ ... $.ajax({ success: function(data){ data.html() });
[13:39:38] <duch_kazatel> .html() only works on jquery objects.
[13:39:44] <duch_kazatel> $(data).html();
[13:39:51] <rjCousineau> $('#result').html(data.html);
[13:41:05] <duch_kazatel> is .html a property on data?
[13:43:24] <MikeD_> echo?!?
[13:44:22] <MikeD_> oh, you said .php - i guess i should read the whole line
[13:44:29] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:45:17] <MikeD_> mixing $ from php and $ from jquery with liberally sprinkling "data" and "html" (esp. as a method and a property) is hella confusing.
[13:49:10] <jquery654> hi all
[13:50:05] <duch_kazatel> hello!
[13:50:39] <jquery654> could someone explain me how i get values from a hidden input field where the value is created dynamically?  like for example a shop which has a buy button and when you click on it you get the value of the hidden field above?
[13:50:54] <duch_kazatel> you use .val() on the element.
[13:51:51] <duch_kazatel> that answer the question?
[13:51:51] <jquery654> wait lemme give some kind of example
[13:52:58] <jquery654> i know its val but it doesnt work on my example for every single element
[13:53:02] <jquery654> http://pastebin.com/gcR86cBS
[13:53:18] <jquery654> in this function i create several  products
[13:53:27] <duch_kazatel> "for every single element"?
[13:53:43] <jquery654> every product has a hidden field with an unique id. and i need to fetch that value
[13:54:00] <duch_kazatel> <button id='btnBuy' class='btn btn-default'>Add to cart</button>\n\
[13:54:03] <duch_kazatel> that's part of your problem.
[13:54:08] <duch_kazatel> can't duplicate IDs.
[13:54:13] <Duikb00t-ome> ola
[13:54:26] <jquery654> ohh
[13:54:31] <Duikb00t-ome> oh
[13:54:31] <jquery654> it needs to be a class
[13:54:36] <duch_kazatel> sounds like it's an event handler issue.
[13:54:39] <Duikb00t-ome> Someone here using Gulp & jquery?
[13:54:50] <duch_kazatel> Duikb00t-ome what's your question?
[13:54:58] <Duikb00t-ome> I want to embed jquery inside my main.js file
[13:55:03] <Duikb00t-ome> But #gulp is dead.
[13:55:07] <Duikb00t-ome> So Im reaching out here for some help.
[13:55:48] <duch_kazatel> "embed"?  you mean you want to combine some files via gulp?
[13:55:50] <Duikb00t-ome> This https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jquery will set it up as a sepearte file .. I want to merge it in my main 'application.js' file.
[13:55:51] <Duikb00t-ome> yes
[13:56:01] <duch_kazatel> why?
[13:56:16] <Duikb00t-ome> 1 server call is much neater
[13:56:22] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily.
[13:56:25] <duch_kazatel> give and take.
[13:56:32] <Duikb00t-ome> hmmm
[13:56:33] <jquery654> http://pastebin.com/bcawqRfp
[13:56:37] <jquery654> its still not working
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> either way, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24591854/using-gulp-to-concatenate-and-uglify-files
[13:56:44] <jquery654> i get an id yes
[13:56:48] <jquery654> but always the same
[13:56:53] <jquery654> not the different ones
[13:57:16] <duch_kazatel> because you're getting all of them.
[13:57:26] <duch_kazatel> not the one near the button you clicked.
[13:57:31] <duch_kazatel> need to make it contextual off $(this)
[13:58:02] <jquery654> var text =  $(this).find(".hiddenField").val();   ?
[13:58:09] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:58:14] <duch_kazatel> .find() is for descendents.
[13:58:16] <jquery654> srry trying to learn
[13:58:39] <duch_kazatel> you have a sibling.  i'd do something like .closest('div').find('.hiddenField').val()
[13:59:20] <jquery654> is it possible to get a concret example?
[13:59:23] <Duikb00t-ome> http://kopy.io/mdO1S  so far b
[13:59:29] <Duikb00t-ome> ut it's not setting up that damn file while gulping :D
[14:02:55] <jquery654> ok i m completely lost
[14:03:01] <MassDebates> Mmh, Duikb00t-ome
[14:03:07] <MassDebates> I see a gulp file
[14:03:13] <MassDebates> got some building and then a watcher
[14:03:17] <MassDebates> Whatchya makin?
[14:03:23] <Duikb00t-ome> Setting up a new WP theme
[14:03:27] <MassDebates> Ahhhhhhh
[14:03:37] <MassDebates> Coolio. I don't use gulp for wp
[14:03:38] <hd1> why is jquery issuing a head request to '/' when I wan to issue a post request to /schedule?
[14:03:40] <Duikb00t-ome> But I was used working with elixir wich is a bit like gulp on steroids
[14:03:44] <MassDebates> I like using it for building email campaigns quickly
[14:03:51] <Duikb00t-ome> it's nice :D
[14:03:54] <MassDebates> I like gulp better, tbh
[14:03:55] <MassDebates> It's much easier imo
[14:04:08] <hd1> erlang?
[14:04:09] <Duikb00t-ome> Yeah but I have it running in a large L5 application ( Elixir) I really like it.
[14:04:23] <MassDebates> Well, some fights you bring a dagger
[14:04:28] <Duikb00t-ome> :D
[14:04:29] <MassDebates> some fights you bring the artillery.
[14:04:37] <Duikb00t-ome> haha true
[14:04:38] <MassDebates> Sounds like you need some cannon
[14:04:42] <MassDebates> cannons*
[14:04:43] <Duikb00t-ome> :D haha
[14:04:55] <Duikb00t-ome> Sound like I need js in a simple theme but Gulpsays no
[14:05:04] <Duikb00t-ome> ( Actually I am doing something stupid wrong ..) :D
[14:05:16] <Duikb00t-ome> But I have to find it.
[14:05:16] <MassDebates> Tbh For the first like
[14:05:17] <MassDebates> 2 years I was using gulp
[14:05:17] <MassDebates> I didn't realize it was javascript at all
[14:05:18] <MassDebates> hahahahahaha
[14:05:25] <Duikb00t-ome> :D haha
[14:05:30] <Duikb00t-ome> I started with grunt
[14:05:33] <Duikb00t-ome> and moved to gulp
[14:05:34] <MassDebates> Same
[14:05:36] <MassDebates> Same
[14:05:36] <MassDebates> lol
[14:05:39] <Duikb00t-ome> hihi
[14:05:42] <MassDebates> hihi
[14:06:17] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/ceaba8e28e9192d2eca5d60cc983c1cb
[14:06:25] <Duikb00t-ome> BTW it's friday shoudn't everyone start drinking beers yet?
[14:06:28] <hd1> that's the test code and the html
[14:06:45] <hd1> it's 11am, Duck
[14:06:54] <hd1> everyone's not in Europe here
[14:06:56] <Duikb00t-ome> It's 8 in the evening :D
[14:07:05] <Duikb00t-ome> 8pm
[14:07:12] <hd1> damn timezones
[14:07:15] <jquery654> possible that maybe someone could help me?  *feels ignored*
[14:07:57] <Duikb00t-ome> What error you got?
[14:08:02] <Duikb00t-ome> None?
[14:08:46] <jquery654> well none
[14:08:58] <Duikb00t-ome> Good.
[14:09:04] <jquery654> i still get all of them
[14:09:08] <Duikb00t-ome> You have an error handler no..
[14:09:12] <Duikb00t-ome> Add it just in case..
[14:09:49] <Duikb00t-ome> Next: don't use pastebin
[14:09:51] <jquery654> var text =  $(".fetchData ").find(".hiddenField").val();      is what i have but i just need the one above the clicked button and i dont know how to access it
[14:10:12] <Duikb00t-ome> http://kopy.io/ski0o better to look at
[14:10:27] <Duikb00t-ome> console.log( data );
[14:10:31] <hd1> me? no error that I can see, https://whereishasan.herokuapp.com/schedule isn't called
[14:11:25] <Duikb00t-ome> Also console.log(obj)
[14:11:47] <Duikb00t-ome> I might not totally get it but was error you got?
[14:11:58] <Duikb00t-ome> You only retrieve 1 line in your results?
[14:12:21] <Duikb00t-ome> or is.. //function to fetch the actual products from the database every 2 minutes it refreshes the content with the current informations just working?
[14:12:35] <Duikb00t-ome> elo jquery654
[14:12:44] <jquery654> yes
[14:12:47] <jquery654> thats working
[14:12:51] <Duikb00t-ome> I want to know exactly what's going wrong :P
[14:13:05] <jquery654> its not going something wrong
[14:13:08] <jquery654> let me explain again:
[14:13:20] <jquery654> i get ids (products) from the db
[14:13:42] <jquery654> i stick them into a hidden field and want to fetch them when clicking on the buy buttons
[14:13:45] <Duikb00t-ome> $prods = products();
[14:13:50] <Duikb00t-ome> console.log($prods);
[14:13:52] <Duikb00t-ome> what you got?
[14:13:56] <Duikb00t-ome> in there
[14:14:30] <jquery654> the problem is that i dont get the value from the above clicked value but seems like i get all of them
[14:15:00] <Duikb00t-ome> oooh
[14:15:37] <Duikb00t-ome> I suggest you as start to put DOM elements in a varaible
[14:15:52] <Duikb00t-ome> $var hiddenField = $('.hiddenblalal');
[14:16:12] <Duikb00t-ome> $var btnBuy = $('.btnBuy');
[14:16:26] <jquery654> and then? i still dont get the right values then...
[14:16:39] <Duikb00t-ome> no probably not but start setting your c a bitcleinerode
[14:16:44] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/ceaba8e28e9192d2eca5d60cc983c1cb why isn't the remote ajax request sent?
[14:17:17] <jquery654> .fetchData is the parent of them all
[14:17:47] <jquery654> its content is dynamically created, buttons and so on
[14:18:35] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 still ahving the same problem?
[14:18:42] <Duikb00t-ome> what does this say?
[14:18:43] <Duikb00t-ome> http://kopy.io/EICPp
[14:18:44] <jquery654> well yes
[14:18:51] <duch_kazatel> i gave you the solution.
[14:18:54] <duch_kazatel> so what's the problem?
[14:19:00] <jquery654> i tried it and its not working
[14:19:03] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[14:19:22] <Duikb00t-ome> He click a button he has via a AJAX call some stuff he loads he wnat to grab the stuff in a hidden fields ( which got stored after the JS call )
[14:19:34] <Duikb00t-ome> So actually I think you can forget the AJAX call.
[14:19:43] <duch_kazatel> i already helped him.
[14:19:45] <Duikb00t-ome> He has to find the values in the hidden field. On button click.
[14:19:53] <duch_kazatel> pretty sure i knmow what the confusion is.
[14:19:58] <duch_kazatel> but i'd like to see his code ;)
[14:20:03] <Duikb00t-ome> check mine
[14:20:12] <Duikb00t-ome> it's his code with some more console.log stuff
[14:20:19] <duch_kazatel> you're not the one asking the question ;)
[14:20:26] <Duikb00t-ome> http://kopy.io/EICPp no but Im the contributer
[14:20:39] <duch_kazatel> you gonna le him learn orr.,..?
[14:20:58] <Duikb00t-ome> http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/22/10/356F621400000578-0-image-a-1_1466586485436.jpg    Hand of God
[14:21:00] <duch_kazatel> and this doesn't have what i suggested he use.
[14:21:09] <jquery654> http://pastebin.com/0pbzNRmF
[14:21:10] <Duikb00t-ome> Oh I wasn't here yet..
[14:21:13] <duch_kazatel> he said he tried what i gave him earlier but i want to see it.
[14:21:24] <duch_kazatel> $(this).closest(".hiddenField").val();
[14:21:27] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 ^
[14:21:32] <duch_kazatel> you need tomake it contextual.
[14:21:33] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[14:21:34] <jquery654> i really dont get it how you meant i said i m new
[14:21:43] <jquery654> and trying to learn
[14:21:51] <duch_kazatel> $(this).closest("div").find('.hiddenField').val();
[14:21:52] <Duikb00t-ome> closest vs find ;)
[14:22:01] <duch_kazatel> need to get the parent div and then find the input you want.
[14:22:04] <Duikb00t-ome> closest goes down? duch_kazatel ?
[14:22:28] <duch_kazatel> it starts at the current element and goes through ancestors until it finds a match.
[14:22:44] <Duikb00t-ome> but it's going inside the element deeper and deeper not up right?
[14:22:44] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 btw there's learn.jquery.com - good resource if you're learning.
[14:22:47] <duch_kazatel> and try.jquery.com
[14:23:04] <duch_kazatel> Duikb00t-ome ... closest() goes through ancestors, as in parents.
[14:23:12] <Duikb00t-ome> Ok :)
[14:23:36] <hd1> duch_kazatel: any idea what the problem with https://gist.github.com/hdiwan/ceaba8e28e9192d2eca5d60cc983c1cb is ?
[14:23:49] <duch_kazatel> dunno what is it?
[14:23:51] <duch_kazatel> hd1
[14:23:58] <Duikb00t-ome> .py
[14:24:07] <duch_kazatel> hd1 mind actually explaining the issue you're having?
[14:24:10] <Duikb00t-ome> Make your problem more specific please.
[14:24:11] <hd1> there's an HTML file below that
[14:24:13] <jquery654> works now duch_kazatel  thanks.
[14:24:18] <Duikb00t-ome> lol
[14:24:29] <duch_kazatel> hd1 so what's the problem you're having?
[14:24:32] <jquery654> i just need to understand this now
[14:24:35] <hd1> the remote ajax request isn't being sent, duch_kazatel
[14:24:50] <duch_kazatel> hd1 are you checking your console?
[14:25:00] <hd1> duch_kazatel: yes, getting nothing
[14:25:23] <jquery654> i suppose: this is the current alement where the button is in and then go to the first parent and from there it finds the .hiddenfield?
[14:25:30] <duch_kazatel> this page also on https://whereishasan.herokuapp.com/ hd1?
[14:25:43] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 basically.
[14:25:50] <hd1> pardon, duch_kazatel?
[14:25:52] <duch_kazatel> .closest('div') finds the first ancestor that is a div.
[14:26:04] <duch_kazatel> hd1 are you running this code from the same domain?
[14:26:09] <hd1> no
[14:26:10] <duch_kazatel> port, protocol, and domain.
[14:26:16] <duch_kazatel> that's probably why.
[14:26:18] <duch_kazatel> CORS.
[14:26:20] <jquery654> but this means that i could write: $(this).parent().find('.hiddenField').val(); too ?
[14:26:22] <hd1> no, yes, and no
[14:26:31] <hd1> duch_kazatel: so... JSONP?
[14:26:43] <duch_kazatel> hd1 not unless the other server is changed explicitly to support it.
[14:26:48] <jquery654> `taking the parent from the object and then seraching from there?
[14:27:04] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 you can do that, but it's a little cleaner to use closest() imo.
[14:27:09] <duch_kazatel> especially with a solid class name
[14:27:24] <jquery654> ok so i got a question about this then
[14:27:30] <jquery654> if you have to go several parents up
[14:27:36] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 closest()
[14:27:38] <jquery654> instead of writing parent().parent()
[14:27:43] <duch_kazatel> it keeps going until it finds the correct element.
[14:27:45] <jquery654> and so on
[14:27:51] <duch_kazatel> this is why good classes are important.
[14:27:59] <jquery654> is there a way to shorten this?
[14:28:04] <duch_kazatel> just explained how.
[14:28:14] <jquery654> ok so closest is the way to go
[14:28:15] <hd1> duch_kazatel: how do I get around this then? move all the pages over to the same domain?
[14:28:29] <duch_kazatel> hd1 or allow cors from the other domain.
[14:28:51] <hd1> duch_kazatel: how do i allow cors from a heroku instance?
[14:28:54] <duch_kazatel> or have your backend recognize those requests from that other domain and allow cors for those.
[14:29:06] <duch_kazatel> hd1 you'll have to search google for that.
[14:30:09] <jquery654> duch_kazatel:  from where on does closest operates so? from the button or from the .fetchData i m bit confused about the logic how this actually works maybe i dont have the correct thinking on how it works
[14:30:21] <duch_kazatel> i alreddy explained that...
[14:30:50] <Duikb00t-ome> merde  eh
[14:30:52] <Duikb00t-ome> stupid gulp stuff
[14:31:10] <duch_kazatel> jqlog either way http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:31:16] <duch_kazatel> "For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree."
[14:31:19] <duch_kazatel> err, jquery654
[14:31:54] <hd1> hmm
[14:31:56] <duch_kazatel> so $(this).closest('div'); check if $(this) is a div and, if not, starts going through every ancestor of it until it finds one, then stops.
[14:32:53] <Duikb00t-ome> http://kopy.io/z6v6R#line-33   I think im almost there
[14:33:08] <jquery654> starting from the button which got clicked i suppose?
[14:33:17] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 in your case, yes.
[14:33:22] <duch_kazatel> whatever $(this) is.
[14:33:41] <jquery654> i though in my case $(this) represents the .fetchData
[14:33:58] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 you sure about that?
[14:34:06] <jquery654> now no more
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> link?
[14:34:22] <jquery654> i m actually pretty sure that it only can be the button in my case
[14:34:24] <duch_kazatel> to the code imean.
[14:34:29] <jquery654> then goes up searches for that div
[14:34:29] <duch_kazatel> let me look.
[14:34:46] <duch_kazatel> Duikb00t-ome you're still having trouble using concat?
[14:36:25] <duch_kazatel> jquery654 btw $(this) is not .fetchdata in that example you shared earlier.
[14:36:34] <duch_kazatel> it's whatever .btnBuy was clicked.
[14:37:05] <jquery654> ok
[14:37:13] <jquery654> so i understand now they way it goes
[14:37:32] <jquery654> many thanks
[14:37:37] <duch_kazatel> Duikb00t-ome you realize you have anoter concat example right next to that link, right?
[14:39:25] <Duikb00t-ome> .pipe(concat('theme.js')) that one
[14:40:04] <duch_kazatel> si
[14:40:45] <Duikb00t-ome> I think I nknew it
[14:47:18] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[14:47:53] <hd1> ok, it works now
[14:48:12] <duch_kazatel> hd1 cool.
[14:49:18] <hd1> duch_kazatel: just moved the page over to the same domain and corrected the captcha key
[14:49:34] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[14:52:23] <hd1> bootstrap channel is dead :(
[14:53:27] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[15:23:56] <duch_kazatel> WEEEEEE
[16:00:57] <MikeD_> channel is dead?
[16:24:15] <guideX> is there a library which makes an area look like the control panel, or other windows icons area, with draggable icons galore
[16:24:45] <guideX> selectable/draggable etc like in windows
[16:25:36] <btracht> i have tried everything to get dataTables to work with no luck. can anyone help?
[16:30:13] <guideX> datatables work good for me
[16:35:55] <btracht> guideX: i have read how easy they are to set up. i cant make em work
[16:37:09] <btracht> i have just copied the example files (not even trying to get them to work with my data now) and still not working
[16:37:22] <btracht> i must be missing something os obvious
[16:40:10] <guideX> http://preview.oklerthemes.com/porto/5.2.0/feature-admin-tables-advanced.html
[16:40:28] <guideX> datatables seem so FAST too
[16:48:46] <btracht> i'll have to keep playiong with. haven't figured it out yet
[21:27:08] <erebel55> does anyone know why my div disappears instantly instead of fading out?
[21:27:13] <erebel55> https://jsfiddle.net/au4eckLh/3/
[21:54:26] <shoky> erebel55: because you are doing .fadeOut on both of the .media-div's , and the 2nd one is already hidden so the callback runs right away. (and it also runs again after the fade time)
[21:54:53] <shoky> erebel55: just use css transitions and .addClass/.removeClass/.toggleClass
[21:55:17] <erebel55> oh I see
[21:55:58] <erebel55> looking up transitions
[22:02:30] <erebel55> shoky, hmm would I have to wait until the transition is finished to do the addClass hidden?
[22:11:00] <erebel55> yeah I'll probably just stop using the bootstrap hidden css class
[22:11:03] <erebel55> it's just making this harder
