[00:02:45] <PrasanthG> Hello, in this responsive tabs example, the menu items are showed as  list items on load. How to hide them or lazy load while the page loads? http://jellekralt.github.io/Responsive-Tabs/demo/demo.html#tab-3
[00:02:59] <Sefid_par> I need a script for sliding images like this:
[00:03:00] <Sefid_par> http://www.petrofahm.ir/en/
[00:03:10] <Sefid_par> whould you mind give it to me?
[00:04:08] <PrasanthG> the issue can be noticed in IE 8 or on slow internet connection.
[00:24:51] <Sefid_par> Please help me by this code: http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/1FFB
[00:24:55] <Sefid_par> It does not work
[00:25:21] <Sefid_par> the documentation is this: http://www.jqueryscript.net/slideshow/Performant-Touch-Friendly-Carousel-Plugin-for-jQuery-microfiche-js.html
[01:15:10] <Cruz> Hi! How is possible to combine a fadeout and then a fadein? My actual function looks like : $(".wrapper").addClass('animated fadeOut'); and directly after:  $(".wrapper").addClass('animated bounceIn');  However only the fadeOut works....
[01:47:17] <ZP18> Hi
[03:46:34] <taylorex99> Anyone free to help us out with a jQuery toggle question?
[04:06:39] <shoky> taylorex99: shoot
[04:19:40] <taylorex99> Thanks Shoky, I need help with toggling divs and classes around http://jsfiddle.net/webdriven/qa2D5/
[04:19:41] <taylorex99> I have two divs named "autocomplete_box" which are independent of each other and only display if the "tigger" class is clicked inside it's parent div. I want to slide each autocomplete down depending on the trigger they've clicked and toggle <i class="fa fa-chevron-up"> so it's <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"> (so it shows the active and non-active state) having the classes change is where I need
[04:19:41] <taylorex99> help with.
[04:23:24] <shoky> taylorex99:  ($('.autocomplete_box').slideUp())(el.slideDown())   that's wrong..
[04:23:34] <shoky> you're getting an error on that
[04:24:47] <shoky> taylorex99: anyways,  $(this).find('.fa').toggleClass('fa-chevron-down fa-chevron-up')     should toggle those classes
[04:29:26] <taylorex99> Great thanks for that~ although it works every second click? doesn't sync with my clicks and the box dropping etc
[04:29:27] <shoky> taylorex99: http://jsfiddle.net/qa2D5/1/
[04:29:44] <shoky> taylorex99: that's probably happening because of the error i mentioned..
[04:31:35] <taylorex99> hah you example is a lot neater than mine. Can it collapse the non-active div like as if it's an accordion?
[04:33:14] <shoky> taylorex99: yah  http://jsfiddle.net/qa2D5/2/
[04:33:41] <taylorex99> :) thanks I love your work
[04:33:49] <shoky> ;]
[04:36:16] <taylorex99> Whats a less dodgy way to make clicks outside of the autocomplete box close the effect and slide back up? or is $('html').click(function() { fine?
[04:46:36] <erming> taylorex99: you could use $(document).on("click", too
[04:48:19] <erming> oh, outside the box.. nvm then
[04:53:09] <taylorex99> Basically if they go to click on something else on the page, I want the autocomplete box to slide back up
[04:54:45] <antlong_> Could really use a hand with changing this functionality: https://dpaste.de/hfop
[05:50:01] <edgarmarquez_> HI. For some reason im unable to use this jquery script on my drupal site: http://geckohub.com/jquery/youtubeplaylist/
[05:50:10] <edgarmarquez_> :S i developed a drupal theme and im programming the front page, http://egemsoft.org/despertarfinal/ it works fine
[05:50:17] <edgarmarquez_> but i need to include that script on the bottom area of the page
[05:50:24] <edgarmarquez_> the script gets the video image preview and when you click on the link it loads them on a certain <div>
[05:50:39] <edgarmarquez_> the most weird part, is that i have another theme with this script, and it works just fine: http://fancomix.net/despertar2/ this one
[05:50:53] <edgarmarquez_> I have tried with several jquery versions
[05:50:58] <edgarmarquez_> to see if it was a compatibility issue
[05:51:18] <edgarmarquez_> and i have checked with a javascript debugger to see if it was something wrong
[05:51:29] <edgarmarquez_> But nothing
[05:51:39] <edgarmarquez_> and im getting out of ideas :S, so...
[05:51:57] <edgarmarquez_> any help could be nice :'(
[06:05:59] <TimmyTones> how would I go about defining a variable 'position(i)' where i is an integer from 1-5? so create a named position1 (or 2,3,4,5).
[06:38:55] <uskerine> how can I refer another datatables cell of the same row?
[06:38:56] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/fbubPPiF
[06:40:05] <uskerine> So there are 8 columns, 'this' refer to column 3 and I would like to get/set column 2 of the same row, being column 2 nto visible
[06:40:07] <uskerine> not*
[06:43:04] <jacksmith> My server gives a unix timestamp, and i need to format and show it in PDT, independent of client browser Timezone settings, how this cloud be done using jQuery  ?
[06:44:38] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $(this).closest('tr').find('td').eq(index);
[06:45:03] <uskerine> BillCriswell I will try that right now, but do you know if that works with hidden columns in datatables plugin?
[06:45:13] <BillCriswell> uskerine: No idea.
[06:45:28] <BillCriswell> jQuery doesn't care if it's hidden or not so not sure if that would.
[06:46:03] <uskerine> I think the column is not in html
[06:46:11] <uskerine> It is handlded some way by datatables
[06:46:23] <uskerine> is there any way to get the current row index of datatables given "this"?
[06:46:30] <bePolite> TimmyTones: var temp = 'position('+i+');
[06:46:46] <uskerine> that would work as I could use: $(table.row(i).data()[3]).val(),
[06:46:56] <uskerine> which works with hidden columns
[06:50:58] <uskerine> no that not works, as html code only has the visible ones
[07:01:26] <uskerine> if this is an <input> element in a datatbales.net  cell, should this work? var rowIndex = table.fnGetPosition( $(this).closest('tr') );
[07:59:28] <daedeloth> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7716655/
[07:59:40] <daedeloth> no additional data is sent
[07:59:44] <daedeloth> what am I doing wrong? :)
[08:00:55] <systemfault> Make us a jsfiddle so we can play with the code. A static pastebin isn't useful (jsfiddle.net)
[08:01:04] <systemfault> We need a testcase.
[08:02:07] <daedeloth> http://jsfiddle.net/mmhqU/
[08:03:03] <daedeloth> http://jsfiddle.net/mmhqU/1/
[08:04:21] <daedeloth> or, well, with some more output
[08:04:22] <daedeloth> http://jsfiddle.net/mmhqU/2/
[08:04:43] <daedeloth> I'm doing something very basically wrong :)
[08:06:09] <systemfault> daedeloth: http://jsfiddle.net/mmhqU/3/
[08:07:17] <daedeloth> hm, not entirely sure why the other thing doesn't work, but thanks :)
[08:07:39] <systemfault> daedeloth: The other way http://jsfiddle.net/mmhqU/4/
[08:08:19] <daedeloth> oh, ok
[08:08:24] <daedeloth> thanks :)
[08:08:28] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[08:20:43] <GoSox> can you repeatedly change IDs, by referencing ID, without any problems? something like $("#id").attr("id","newid");
[08:21:14] <GoSox> i want to make a new item, delete an old item, and then switch the new item's id to the old item's ID, so i'm back where I started. And I want to do this every few seconds, over and over
[08:36:21] <decx> don't
[08:41:29] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:41:55] <DukeDrake> I'm currently porting a jquery ajax script aI wrote a while back to the current version.
[08:42:23] <DukeDrake> I understand, there is no "onreadystatechange"-event any more
[08:44:16] <DukeDrake> however, I figure as $.ajax implements the deferred interface, I could still get the readyState of my xhr object with the help of the progress() function?
[08:44:24] <DukeDrake> ( http://api.jquery.com/deferred.progress/ )
[08:50:03] <systemfault> DukeDrake: jQuery doesn't support the progress event (Even though deferred supports them)
[08:50:13] <systemfault> DukeDrake: You can easily hack it in though
[08:50:59] <systemfault> DukeDrake: IIRC, you only have to add the progress event in the beforeSend callback of the $.ajax config
[08:56:59] <DukeDrake> wow =)
[08:57:05] <DukeDrake> that would be great ^^
[08:59:05] <systemfault> DukeDrake: Need an example?
[09:00:41] <systemfault> Hhmm, that hack changed.. you need to use the xhr config option..
[09:02:34] <DukeDrake> yes
[09:02:45] <DukeDrake> example would be great! =)
[09:05:08] <systemfault> DukeDrake: Are you using formdata?
[09:05:56] <Baako> hi guys i have this http://pastebin.com/VCCiN4bA in a file called contact.js inside this file i have other jquery functions but for some result this function doesn't run
[09:06:06] <Baako> i tested it in firebug and it works
[09:06:29] <DukeDrake> systemfault: well ... this shouldn't matter for the functionality?
[09:06:31] <Baako> so why can't it run without me having to put it in firebug
[09:07:34] <systemfault> DukeDrake: Well, it's just that you need XHR2 to send files… and usually people use FormData to do it.
[09:07:47] <systemfault> Which is why I was asking..
[09:08:05] <DukeDrake> ah, ok. I'm sending simple POST-Text stuffs ^^
[09:08:33] <systemfault> And you need progress for that? Okay, I'll write a simple example
[09:10:19] <DukeDrake> yes, server takes time and sends bits of data back while it's working =)
[09:10:25] <DukeDrake> that'd be awesome =)
[09:12:49] <systemfault> DukeDrake: http://jsfiddle.net/XMvdB/
[09:14:23] <DukeDrake> hmm, nice =D
[09:14:59] <systemfault> Version using .on instead of addEventListener http://jsfiddle.net/XMvdB/1/
[09:15:07] <DukeDrake> ah, there's access to the actual xhr object, that's nice =)
[09:15:42] <Baako> any ideas please
[09:16:46] <DukeDrake> systematik: what's "xhr.upload" ?
[09:17:45] <systemfault> DukeDrake: You need to use xhr.upload if you want to attach event to the upload, without it, it would attach the progress event to the download event
[09:18:02] <DukeDrake> oy =D
[09:18:04] <DukeDrake> ok!
[09:19:08] <systemfault> Baako: It's impossible to help you without more information… the only thing I can tell you right now is that it looks like it's syntactically valid.
[09:19:16] <DukeDrake> actually I ponder whether to simply fall back to xhr completely
[09:20:34] <systemfault> DukeDrake: What is the lower IE version you need to support?
[09:20:39] <systemfault> *lowest
[09:21:24] <DukeDrake> none xD
[09:21:44] <systemfault> Ah. Then you don't even need jQuery if you want.
[09:21:48] <DukeDrake> ah, I need xhr download anyway .... because I wait for data FROM the server
[09:22:02] <systemfault> DukeDrake: Then just remove the "upload" part
[09:22:24] <DukeDrake> but xhr.upload is awesome I guess !
[09:24:46] <DukeDrake> well ... doesn't work xD
[09:25:02] <DukeDrake> progress is actually an event of xhr?
[09:26:14] <DukeDrake> ah, if I exchange 'progress' with 'readystatechange' ot works..... I figure, progress is an event of xhr.upload =)
[09:26:19] <DukeDrake> *it
[09:26:42] <systemfault> There's no reason to use readystatechange....
[09:26:50] <systemfault> On modern browsers...
[09:27:34] <systemfault> You use events instead 'load', 'progress', 'error', 'abort' .. etc..
[09:29:01] <DukeDrake> but progress doesn't work ..... hm
[09:31:19] <DukeDrake> I'll have to read up ... ^^
[09:31:20] <DukeDrake> bbl
[09:35:31] <Baako> hi i am trying to get those validation to run when someone focuses out of those fields
[09:35:34] <Baako> http://pastebin.com/7BffwVpW
[09:36:27] <Baako> i have those those i have also try it when i click on the submit button but it doesn't seem to work
[09:36:46] <Baako> no errors but the validation doesn't run
[09:37:04] <Baako> i have download both jquert plugin and the validate plugin
[09:44:21] <DukeDrake> systemfault: I found it ^^ "When it is said to switch to the DONE state run these steps: (...) Fire a progress event named progress. " (http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#switch-done )
[09:44:28] <DukeDrake> But I need the loading state =)
[09:44:49] <systemfault> What?
[09:45:12] <systemfault> You handle the load/error/progress event. Where the link with the loading state?
[09:45:19] <DukeDrake> that#s why progress event doesn't work, but readystatechange does work.
[09:45:29] <systemfault> fml...
[09:45:41] <systemfault> I told you to not use the old readystate crap.
[09:46:29] <JimmyXander> Hello Everybody
[09:48:34] <DukeDrake> systemfault: I need to handle state 3 as the php script churns data...
[09:49:59] <systemfault> I see, that's unusual
[09:50:17] <DukeDrake> well ..... dunno.
[09:50:36] <DukeDrake> I still have to figure out, how to access stuff once the event fired xD
[09:50:39] <DukeDrake> (bbl)
[09:52:20] <JimmyXander> jquery is delightful
[11:03:36] <Kronos92> hi
[11:04:07] <Kronos92> can anybody tell me how to import jquerry >1,2  from cdn or where the url is
[11:04:26] <Kronos92> i am relativly new to javascript :D i would be very grateful for help
[11:04:27] <Shadark> Hi people, someone could help me with some JSONP calls?
[11:04:51] <systemfault> yup
[11:04:53] <systemfault> sup
[11:05:30] <systemfault> Kronos92: <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script> in the <head> of your html document
[11:05:38] <Shadark> I'm trying to make some JSONP requests in a for loop, but I don't have a clue about storing the results in an array
[11:06:03] <systemfault> Shadark: What is your code so far?
[11:06:04] <Shadark> I tried some code but the problem is the asynchronism of the requests, and my array ends empty
[11:06:26] <Shadark> https://gist.github.com/Shadark/3eaeb731ea06cfb2f180
[11:07:55] <systemfault> Shadark: Yeah, you have asynchronicity issues
[11:08:02] <Shadark> List has the correct objects, but not dates_obj
[11:08:38] <systemfault> Shadark: The rule is simple, if a function has an async function call in it, it has to also become async
[11:08:57] <systemfault> Also, for/in is not for arrays (unrelated)
[11:09:19] <Shadark> I began writing some callbacks, but I feared going into Callback Hell
[11:09:35] <Shadark> and I don't have a clue about how to make a callback for multiple requests
[11:09:50] <Kronos92> systemfault, thats version 1.11 i want to use jquerry file tree
[11:09:53] <systemfault> Shadark: You need to use the promise interface of $.ajax + $.when
[11:09:57] <Kronos92> so i need 1.2 or better
[11:10:07] <Shadark> Tried looking some documentation about wait and then, but didn't find anything about variable requests
[11:10:15] <systemfault> Kronos92: 1.11 is 9 versions higher than 1.2
[11:10:22] <systemfault> Kronos92: What more do you want?
[11:10:23] <Shadark> all the examples were with a designated number of requests
[11:10:44] <systemfault> Shadark: Do you want me to write an example?
[11:10:47] <Kronos92> ohh okay javascript versions going down ? :D
[11:11:01] <systemfault> Kronos92: 2 is lower than 11
[11:11:05] <systemfault> Kronos92: It's basic math.
[11:11:35] <Kronos92> ohh 11 i read 1.1  i am sorry :D i had to sleep
[11:11:36] <Shadark> It would be very appreciated ^^ I didn't have much time to learn JS/jQuery and I need to finish this ASAP.
[11:11:44] <Kronos92> thanks a lot
[11:11:49] <Shadark> (And sorry for my English, it's not my first language)
[11:12:04] <systemfault> Shadark: It isn't mine either… so don't worry
[11:16:31] <systemfault> Shadark: http://jsfiddle.net/Wu4sV/
[11:20:42] <Shadark> I'll give it a look, thank you ;)
[11:31:55] <Shadark> systemfault: I tried adapting your code and works fine, I get an array with all the objects I need
[11:32:22] <Shadark> But how can I access that array (or some other value after modifying that array) outside that function?
[11:32:38] <Shadark> Because in my index.html I need to load a value to show my list of events in a calendar
[11:33:35] <systemfault> Shadark: The first thing I said, if you have a function that uses an async function, your function becomes an async function. It needs a callback.
[11:33:57] <systemfault> Or a promise..
[11:34:18] <Shadark> And how can I create an asnync function in my index.html so it returns an object?
[11:34:57] <systemfault> Forget about return. There's no "return" with async programming. 2 seconds..
[11:35:02] <Shadark> I'm trying to grasp the concept of asynchronicity in this context, but all I see is making a function inside another function inside another function and everything ends being a big clusterfuck
[11:37:01] <systemfault> Shadark: http://jsfiddle.net/Wu4sV/1/
[11:37:34] <Shadark> Ok, let me see...
[11:37:53] <systemfault> Shadark: So basically… everything in your code that follows "getEvents" need to be inside the .done(function() { }) function
[11:38:18] <systemfault> (You can also add a .fail to the code at the bottom to handle errors
[11:39:08] <Shadark> And how can I fix my index.html so I'm sure the value I'm trying to use has been loaded/initialized?
[11:39:24] <Shadark> (I have something like caldata: event_list)
[11:39:47] <systemfault> Shadark: Lines from 37 to 50 should be in the .done
[11:40:36] <Shadark> Maybe I forgot mentioning this, but this is an external file called from my index.html
[11:40:51] <Shadark> So I don't have any clues about the code inside the js file from my html
[11:41:27] <systemfault> I don't understand at all now :/
[11:42:09] <Shadark> First of all, I'm trying to make a calendar
[11:42:23] <Shadark> The library I'm using uses a javascript object to load a list of events, and puts them in the calendar
[11:42:43] <Shadark> In the demo the javascript object is a static value inside a file called data.js
[11:42:59] <Shadark> But I need to get the events from a DB, so I made events.js
[11:43:13] <Shadark> And I need to end with a variable which I can use in index.html
[11:43:42] <systemfault> Shadark: The variable you need to use is the one inside the .done() at the end of my example
[11:44:36] <systemfault> You need to change your mind a little bit to work with async code … it's painful at first.
[11:44:45] <Shadark> And when I call the variable from index.html, it's 100% true it has been loaded?
[11:45:27] <systemfault> Shadark: When .done at the bottom of my example is called, you have the data and it's accessible from inside that function.
[11:46:03] <Shadark> Hmmmm
[11:46:34] <Shadark> Let me try something with your code, I'll report back in a few minutes
[11:48:51] <eax> Hi there, jQuery-UI question, on "stop" of sortable, why does the "sender" give me a null value?
[11:54:07] <Shadark> systemfault: I tried implementing your code ("tried") like this: https://gist.github.com/Shadark/3eaeb731ea06cfb2f180 but the console gives me an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'done' of undefined, line 45
[11:54:34] <Shadark> welp, no
[11:54:38] <Shadark> let me change something
[11:55:38] <Shadark> I'm a little confused :/
[11:56:23] <Shadark> systemfault: The code you posted should be inside the callback of getEventsId? Or getEventsId should be var getEventsId = function(data) ?
[11:58:17] <systemfault> Hmm
[11:58:46] <eax> Is there seriously no way to get the original sender of a sortable AFTER I have dropped the item in the new lit?
[11:58:49] <eax> *list
[12:08:28] <Shadark> systemfault: Any ideas? Sorry to trouble you :/
[12:08:57] <`e> Shadark, what's your problem?
[12:09:55] <Edvard> hi
[12:10:11] <systemfault> Shadark: I just don't know how to explain it at this point .. :/
[12:14:31] <systemfault> Shadark: I know you need to get it done… I even spoonfed you. It's just that you need time to properly understand the async stuff.. (Time that your don't seem to have)
[12:14:35] <Shadark> `e: I'm trying to make some jsonp calls, store the results in an array, do something with that array and access the resulting object outside the js file (I'm loading it from my html file)
[12:16:16] <`e> can you paste some code on a pastebin?
[12:17:30] <Shadark> My original code was this: https://gist.github.com/Shadark/3eaeb731ea06cfb2f180/da9e2ae548f09a3cbc80cd6395c7e16da252949d and I tried some modifications following systemfault 's jsfiddle ( http://jsfiddle.net/Wu4sV/1/ ) , resulting in this: https://gist.github.com/Shadark/3eaeb731ea06cfb2f180/e9a43cf3c8b51f7cd25e457f97477459bba8ff1e - but that gives me some errors
[12:17:53] <Shadark> systemfault: Don't worry, I know it's not your obligation to help me :P
[12:18:12] <Edvard> what is recommended for offline maps?
[12:18:42] <Edvard> trying to make it so a map is usable offline for mobile devices, any ideas?
[12:20:17] <`e> what error gives it?
[12:20:45] <Shadark> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'done' of undefined, line 45
[12:24:09] <systemfault> Shadark: add return to line 19
[12:24:26] <systemfault> Shadark: getEventsId(function(data) { becomes return getEventsId(function(data) {
[12:25:59] <Shadark> same error with return getEventsId(function(data) {
[12:26:16] <`e> getevents is a function, so when you call it, in you case it returns a value, so you can catch it when it run
[13:49:58] <SweetGuM> hey... http://pastebin.com/UtBftTDt
[13:50:01] <SweetGuM> help?
[13:54:34] <eax> SweetGuM: Try typing jQuery instead of $ :)
[13:55:42] <SweetGuM> k

[18:52:19] <Fraz> hey
[18:52:46] <Fraz> am i doing something wrong here? how ar ethe objects properties different after being used in the transition?
[18:52:48] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/6DfJ9/7/
[18:57:00] <jaspertheghost>  error.appendTo($("#" + finalElementName + "_validate"));   how can i empty empty FinalElementname_validate before appendto like this in one line?
[18:57:04] <Fraz> i just dont understand how the properties of t are altered. the transition function does its own extend of the passed object and uses that
[18:57:15] <Fraz> and even if it didnt, it shouldnt modify t
[19:32:17] <Guest70426> hi
[19:33:02] <webdriven> Is anyone free to help fix a toggle issue between classes?
[19:33:48] <Hyperking> whats the best way to do a click event? .on('click') or .on('mousedown')
[19:34:06] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: .click
[19:34:21] <BillCriswell> .on('click') *
[19:42:36] <Guest70426> BillCriswell you worked with jquery mobile?
[19:42:56] <BillCriswell> Guest70426: Barely.
[19:43:04] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: bare with me for a moment, but what would be appropriate for mobile devices?
[19:43:31] <Hyperking> .on('click') seems on break things. Im using a map
[19:44:22] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: How does it break? I don't run into issues with click on mobile.
[19:45:16] <Hyperking> Im basically trying to tell a div to go away when an element is clicked. It works right on desktop but the map markers no longer have a click event for their buttons
[19:45:40] <Guest70426> a map?
[19:45:51] <Guest70426> what is this you speak of, i keep seeing it
[19:46:10] <Guest70426> but thought it was related to a geographical map :S
[19:58:50] <webdriven> Can someone help with http://jsfiddle.net/webdriven/XF7jq/ I need toggleClass('fa-chevron-down fa-chevron-up'); only on the one that's clicked. At the moment if I click on either "Set your store" or "Estimate" it forgets to reset the other class.
[20:15:32] <jaspertheghost> http://jsfiddle.net/W6VL2/   this javascript is return 05/28/2014 and it should return 06/28/2014
[20:22:44] <Guest70426> when i press F5 on a dynamic page the data is lost
[20:23:13] <Guest70426> so if the user was to reload in the browser by mistake the selected page would appear blank
[20:23:28] <Guest70426> if this normal behaviour ?
[21:44:51] <benlieb> is prototype.js dead?

[23:11:36] <PurpleDog> I'm new to javascript and jquery, but I can use jquery anywhere that I can use javascript, right?
[23:12:13] <PurpleDog> all I have to do is include <script src="...min.js"</script>?
[23:12:51] <PurpleDog> and does it strain the servers to directly include "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js", or should I be hosting that on my own server or something?
[23:51:45] <rahuldroy_> hi guys, does anyone know how to kill js. I have used throw which kills it. then I put a catch block in to warn the users but I still want it to stop executing
