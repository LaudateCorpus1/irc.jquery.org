[00:06:05] <acidjazz> tapout: id avise against using js for those type of animations if you could
[00:06:08] <acidjazz> id avise*
[00:06:11] <acidjazz> advise*
[00:58:23] <momomo> i have a tabindex on a list of elements ... when I tab, the list is scrolled so I can see that they become tabbed and selected .. but I am unable to see it or style it when they are tabbed so i can give feedback where the tabbing is at .. nromally you would have an outline i believe .. :focus is not seem to do antything.. what am I missing here?
[01:46:47] <thomedy> i have a quick question
[01:53:27] <thomedy> i have a question i am trying to know
[01:53:55] <thomedy> I am using a content management system so i am not initiating the ajax
[01:54:00] <thomedy> i am running ajax complete
[01:54:22] <thomedy> ajaxComplete and
[01:55:07] <thomedy> im trying to think of a concrete system, tht i can rely on to run some hide()
[01:55:14] <thomedy> i need elements to be hidden on page load
[01:55:21] <thomedy> but the load is an ajax
[01:55:34] <thomedy> the thing is ... there is more than one load
[02:03:50] <bq_> how to clear content of a div?
[02:21:58] <Kartagis> bq_: $('#div').html('')
[02:24:35] <bq_> Kartagis: ok. i have a strange bug. I have a choose file button and upload button which should clear a div and display something. but upload button does not clear. choose file button clears. both uses html('')
[02:24:42] <bq_> Kartagis: any hint?
[02:25:09] <Kartagis> pastebin the markup
[02:25:15] <Kartagis> jsfiddle.net
[02:30:15] <bq_> https://jsfiddle.net/dzcj8avm/
[02:30:31] <bq_> Kartagis: do you need javascript file?
[02:31:13] <Kartagis> which buttons should but don't?
[02:31:39] <bq_> upload button should clear but don't
[02:31:59] <Kartagis> clear what?
[02:32:37] <bq_> the div whose id is 'results'
[02:35:32] <Kartagis> I think you are trying to clear on submit
[02:35:56] <Kartagis> change that to on click of the button
[02:38:44] <bq_> Kartagis: what is difference? but the submit handler does get called. it just does not clear but append to the previous content.
[02:39:31] <beremaran> can you post again the code
[02:39:47] <Cork> Kartagis, bq_: there is a .empty() method, it is prob the better choice if you just want to clear the element
[02:40:04] <Cork> .html checks if the string is empty and calls empty to clear up data
[02:40:12] <Cork> but why go the round about if you always want to clear it
[02:40:33] <Kartagis> jquery mobile question. does $.mobile.ActivePage  work on named anchors?
[02:40:47] <bq_> beremaran: why? what is the problem with the original https://jsfiddle.net/dzcj8avm/?
[02:42:08] <Cork> bq_: just a side note; you know there are libs so you can parse csv locally right?
[02:42:10] <bq_> Kartagis: also i need to use 'submit' to submit the file, not only the click.
[02:42:53] <bq_> Cork: which lib?
[02:43:41] <Cork> bq_: http://papaparse.com/
[02:44:17] <Cork> been using it for quite a while and it works great
[02:45:23] <bq_> Cork: ok i use nodejs in backend so no big deal.
[02:45:40] <Cork> bq_: well, it is kinda, cause you have to send the data over the server
[02:45:49] <Cork> wait for the server, and then download it again
[02:45:54] <Cork> it adds quite a bit of time
[02:46:22] <Cork> it's the solution we used to use before
[02:46:38] <bq_> Cork: yeah i should refactor that. but now i have to fix the refresh bug above. can you help?
[02:46:54] <Cork> what refresh bug?
[02:46:59] <Cork> (got in a bit late)
[02:47:10] <bq_> i have a strange bug. I have a choose file button and upload button which should clear a div and display something. but upload button does not clear. choose file button clears. both uses html('')
[02:48:24] <Cork> bq_: and both executes the submit event?
[02:48:56] <bq_> Cork: no. file choose button is just a button click. upload is a submit event.
[02:49:13] <Cork> ah, now i see it
[02:49:48] <Cork> bq_: have you verified that the success callback is actually called?
[02:50:00] <Cork> the submit event depends on ajax while the click just modifys the dom
[02:50:21] <Cork> so if the ajax call fails the submit event doesn't reset result
[02:50:50] <bq_> Cork: it is. because it appends new data to the previous content each time i click upload button.
[02:51:38] <bq_> Cork:  it acts as html('') is not in action but all others did take action.
[02:52:13] <Cork> ah, no
[02:52:17] <Cork> that isn't what happens
[02:52:21] <Cork> flow:
[02:52:25] <Cork> 1. submit is clicked
[02:52:32] <Cork> 2. prevent default is called
[02:52:51] <Cork> damn no i read wrong...
[02:53:06] <Cork> you could really simplify this code with deferred
[02:55:04] <bq_> Cork: i don't know how deferred works right now. i just want to get this working quick
[02:55:09] <Cork> bq_: you're using a global for csvdata
[02:55:14] <Cork> that might be a cause
[02:55:48] <Cork> what i would do is modify the .done callback from /readCSV so it only adds content to the results once
[02:55:59] <Cork> and on next call don't do anything
[02:56:13] <Cork> i suspect results is actually cleared
[02:56:23] <Cork> and what is actually happening is your leaking data between calls
[02:56:37] <Cork> i can't straight up see it, but i suspect that is what happens
[02:56:58] <bq_> Cork: oh maybe that case. let me check further.
[03:01:08] <bq_> Cork: no. the csvdata gets assigned new data each time, from line 146: csvdata = fileinfo.csvdata.
[03:01:23] <bq_> Cork: i don't see why csvdata is getting leaked.
[03:01:31] <Cork> bq_: it can be another variable
[03:02:17] <Cork> i have a bit of a trouble picturing the code completely cause it references variable back and forth a bit too much
[03:02:29] <Cork> bq_: so i would recommend following my second suggestion
[03:02:37] <Cork> add a global variable as a counter
[03:02:57] <Cork> and add and if(onlyOnce++ > 0) {} around the .done function contennt
[03:03:01] <Cork> *content
[03:03:17] <Cork> i suspect you will see that it resets the results field just fine
[03:03:30] <Cork> then just move down into the function to see what actually happens
[03:03:56] <Cork> (might be that the server merges the uploaded csv files for example)
[03:07:36] <bq_> Cork: no. the server sends back only the current csv data, no merge. displayed at the console.
[03:09:51] <Cork> bq_: don't be so picky, that is just examples
[03:09:57] <Cork> do the if case and see what you get
[03:10:02] <bq_> Cork: which done? /uploadCSV or /readCSV?
[03:10:06] <Cork> then just slowly enable the code from there
[03:10:08] <Cork> readcsv
[03:10:31] <bq_> Cork: but html('') is called before readcsv.
[03:10:39] <Cork> ...
[03:10:47] <Cork> bq_: read through what i've typed again
[03:11:00] <Cork> don't be so narrow minded when searching for an error
[03:11:16] <Cork> verify that it really is the clearing that isn't working
[03:11:26] <Cork> i'm not convinced it is
[03:12:17] <Cork> bq_: btw there is another thing you can check console.log($('[id="results"]').length)
[03:12:24] <Cork> run that after uploading a few times
[03:12:36] <Cork> make sure it is exactly one and nothing else
[03:13:07] <Uhkis> if only browsers would blow up after seeing duplicate id instead of quirks mode
[03:13:18] <Cork> Uhkis: it isn't quirks mode
[03:13:34] <Cork> it is a defined state of the dom
[03:13:43] <Cork> it just ignores ids if it already has one
[03:13:50] <Cork> (of that entry)
[03:16:30] <Cork> but ya, that html is allowed to be broken without notifying the one writing it annoys me
[03:16:55] <Cork> it should at least throw an error in the developer console
[03:19:09] <Uhkis> for developing purposes one could make a userscript to alert for that though
[03:19:37] <Uhkis> of course if you're competent enough to write that, you probably don't duplicate id's in the first place :)
[03:20:03] <Cork> Uhkis: well put id check sure, i meant a broader any html errors
[03:20:17] <Cork> like unclosed tags mixed nesting and all that
[03:20:37] <Cork> (dangling close tags)
[03:22:04] <Uhkis> at least firefox's view source shows those, doesn't really help with dynamic content though
[03:22:25] <Cork> ya, and it requires you to use view source and not the developer bar
[03:22:28] <Cork> so... ya...
[03:30:58] <bq_> Cork: are you sure console.log($('[id="results"]').length) is what intended? it returns 0 but inspector shows 7 tables inside results.
[03:31:37] <Cork> bq_: yes
[03:31:59] <bq_> Cork: why this happened?
[03:32:09] <Cork> bq_: check your dom
[03:32:14] <Cork> i can't really answer that
[03:33:34] <bq_> Cork: sorry. typo. now it returns 1. but inspector dom shows 7 tables inside results.
[03:33:51] <arc_> why id="results" instead of #results, also how can an id return more than one thing
[03:33:53] <Cork> bq_: the result is expected to be 1
[03:34:07] <Cork> arc_: cause #results will ALWAYS return 0 or 1
[03:34:35] <Cork> while $('[id="results"]') will give you the number of occurrences
[03:34:40] <arc_> i see
[03:34:50] <Cork> this is for debugging, and SHOULD NEVER be used for real selectors
[03:35:01] <arc_> thanks
[03:35:19] <Cork> bq_: the result you got is expected and correct
[03:35:31] <Cork> so that rules out duplicate ids
[03:36:50] <Cork> bq_: btw, the append at line 175 in your fiddle should just be replaced with $('#results').html($datatable);
[03:37:11] <Cork> no need to append to the elements when you only do it once
[03:38:05] <Cork> and in conclution you could remove the html('') on line 134 as it technically isn't needed
[03:43:51] <bq_> Cork: it turns out it is the problem firefox. i changed to chrome, it works.
[03:44:05] <Cork> bq_: no, don't blame the browser
[03:44:16] <Cork> cause that isn't the cause
[03:47:12] <bq_> Cork: i don't know why but it is the cause. everything else is same, only browser changes.
[03:47:27] <Cork> bq_: that is a symtom, not the cause
[03:47:55] <Cork> what you see is the effect of for example a race between ajax calls
[03:47:58] <Cork> or something like that
[03:48:09] <bq_> Cork: i also changed line 175 to $('#results').html($datatable); but the result is the same.
[03:48:34] <Cork> ok, that proves it even more that the results isn't the cause of the problem
[03:49:00] <Cork> bq_: can you provide a demo that actually shows the problem?
[03:49:25] <bq_> Cork: you mean i set up a server some where?
[03:49:39] <Jerrry> How do I use Jquery to select a sibling and take the html inside the tag and put it into a variable?
[03:49:43] <Cork> well i can't help you with a dead html + js dump
[03:50:12] <Jerrry> For example, I have var x = $(this).next().html(); It doesn't work.
[03:50:17] <Cork> Jerrry: depends on how far away a sibling you want
[03:50:33] <Jerrry> Cork: Just the next one in this case.
[03:50:36] <Cork> Jerrry: make a jsfiddle cause that is exactly what it does
[03:50:58] <Jerrry> Cork: http://codepen.io/jerrymouse/pen/zByPLw
[03:51:10] <Cork> Jerrry: meaning the next sibling isn't what you think it is
[03:51:33] <Cork> Jerrry: don't use event attributes
[03:51:39] <Cork> that is the cause of your problem
[03:52:15] <Jerrry> Cork: Don't use attributes? I don't understand.
[03:52:21] <Cork> Jerrry: even attributes
[03:52:27] <Cork> <elm onclick="">
[03:52:37] <Cork> use event listeners $().on()
[03:54:11] <Jerrry> I am trying to make a like/unlike button that changes the number of likes in a sibling span, and it uses onclick="like(commentId)", so I'll have to try to figure this out.
[03:54:33] <Cork> Jerrry: ya, so don't
[03:54:43] <Cork> use event handlers
[03:55:04] <Jerrry> Okay. Originally I couldn't get it to work with event handlers, but I'll try again.
[03:55:46] <Cork> Jerrry: https://jsfiddle.net/9e72oxt8/2/
[03:56:03] <Cork> and for future questions please use a site that has a save button
[03:56:21] <Cork> i'm tired of losing answers to jsbin/codempend and the like
[03:56:30] <Jerrry> Thanks Cork .
[03:56:59] <Jerrry> What's wrong with the Codepen save button?
[03:57:16] <Cork> it doesn't have one
[03:57:22] <Cork> it auto saves
[03:57:30] <Jerrry> Oh, I guess it's because I'm logged in there is one.
[03:57:33] <Cork> so when the other party touches the code the changes are lost
[03:57:56] <Cork> my strongly prefered one are jsfiddle
[03:58:01] <Cork> as it never loses changes
[03:58:09] <Cork> havenn't happened to me once
[03:58:24] <Jerrry> I'll stick to jsfiddle from now.
[03:58:24] <Cork> but jsbin and codepen happens 5 out of 6 times
[03:58:58] <Cork> you can develop where ever you like, but when you post the question please avoid those two
[04:00:27] <bq_> Cork: sorry. html($datatable) works/append($datatable) not. it is not a browser issue indeed. i am trying to set up a server now.
[04:18:07] <hellyeah> yo
[04:20:01] <hellyeah> pls drag a onto b and c onto d sometimes it is not positioned properly what can be the reason of that? http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/0s2s1uvf/4/

[04:23:12] <Cork> there is *

[04:24:07] <Cork> bq_: the only results clearing reference for the submit is //$('#results').empty();
[04:24:13] <Cork> but that's just a comment
[04:33:10] <bq_> Cork: ok uncommented. but somehow it works now
[04:33:17] <bq_> Cork: anyway thanks.

[04:57:48] <G66K> Cork: thanks alot i just pay attention to do
[05:15:03] <PCatinean> If I have a list of input fields and a list of ids, how do I add .hidden class to all input fields that do not have the data-id in the list and remove thos who do?
[05:15:08] <PCatinean> Looking for good syntax mostly
[05:24:05] <G66K> PCatinean: ('#id').addClass('yourClassname');
[05:24:37] <G66K> PCatinean: ('#id').addClass('hide');
[05:24:39] <PCatinean> G66K, I mean from a list of inputs I need to filter out the ones that have the id attribute within a list I have and the ones that don't
[05:24:56] <PCatinean> That means checking for each input if attr('id') is within list [123,1,2,312,312] and viceversa
[05:25:00] <PCatinean> I'm looking into filter(function
[05:25:26] <G66K> PCatinean: post your code jsfiddle
[05:25:44] <G66K> so if i can help probably other may help
[05:25:44] <PCatinean> not much code now, havn't started
[05:25:52] <PCatinean> but I will try to make a test-case
[05:26:19] <G66K> you may use css selectors and function addClass()
[05:26:24] <G66K> to add your class
[05:26:33] <PCatinean> the question is the selector
[05:26:46] <PCatinean> how to use the selector to check my int list
[05:28:25] <G66K> PCatinean: please make test case first
[05:33:02] <Cork> PCatinean: you could do something like $(ids).filter(function() {}).addClasS()
[05:33:17] <Cork> it is prob the cleanest solution
[05:42:14] <TimLoal> i'm trying to do somthing simple in a jQuery widget function, adding a callback on the click event that calls another of the widget's function passing the events
[05:43:33] <TimLoal> i've tried everywhich way i can think of but i either can't my function to fire
[05:43:43] <TimLoal> can anyone help?
[05:43:51] <PCatinean> It seems i do not have access to outside variables with the filter method
[05:44:03] <Cork> PCatinean: you do
[05:44:14] <Cork> TimLoal: make a jsfiddle
[05:46:50] <Cork> PCatinean: https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/
[05:47:47] <Cork> PCatinean: or possibly clearer https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/1/
[05:48:16] <Cork> PCatinean: though note array.includes isn't cross browser
[05:48:55] <Cork> so you so you should prob use $.inArray(list, $(this).data('id') > -1; instead
[05:58:26] <PCatinean> uuhh nice Cork thanks! :D
[05:58:37] * PCatinean applies
[05:58:43] <TimLoal> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/3/  line 42
[05:59:24] <Cork> TimLoal: this.element is already a jqeury object you don't need to wrap it
[05:59:40] <Cork> so $(this.element).addClass() => this.element.addClass()
[06:00:06] <Cork> and that also means this.element._treeview = base; is a bad idea
[06:00:30] <Cork> and var base = $(this); is not what you want
[06:01:00] <TimLoal> yea there will be odd things where i've beed hacking
[06:01:16] <TimLoal> ok let me do that and see what happens
[06:01:18] <TimLoal> cheers
[06:01:49] <Cork> ok, now i see what you're trying to do
[06:02:00] <Cork> TimLoal: you don't add the methods you want to $()
[06:02:18] <Cork> just define them the widget and bind them
[06:02:22] <PCatinean> hmm, seems to return all the inputs
[06:02:56] <Cork> PCatinean: make sure the two types match
[06:03:05] <Cork> PCatinean: so you don't compare numbers with strings for example
[06:03:43] <TimLoal> yea there are a lot of clowns on the web who try to teach what they don't know themselves
[06:03:48] <PCatinean> ahhh, most probably that was it
[06:03:52] <PCatinean> I have to do parseInt I guess
[06:03:58] <TimLoal> thats why i'd never be a teacher, i know i know nothing
[06:04:03] <Cork> TimLoal: have you checked https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/how-to-use-the-widget-factory/ ?
[06:04:08] <Cork> it might help getting you started
[06:04:20] <TimLoal> yes several times
[06:05:18] <Cork> TimLoal: ok, why do you feel you need to have the callback as part of the widget hash?
[06:05:23] <Cork> (or rather object)
[06:05:58] <Cork> cause unless you really need to, just make it inline
[06:07:30] <TimLoal> no need, but it seems neater and contained, ahh because its big
[06:07:43] <PCatinean> Cork, arn't the argument the other way around?
[06:07:57] <Cork> PCatinean: ah, that might be correct
[06:08:07] <PCatinean> yep, works now, thanks a million :D
[06:08:08] <TimLoal> treeviewAction is a router to handle all the treeview's click events
[06:08:10] <Cork> haven't used inArray for a while so don't remember the argument order
[06:08:33] <Cork> TimLoal: ya, but why do you need to expose it?
[06:08:44] <Cork> either way
[06:09:21] <Cork> TimLoal: what you want is this.element.on('click', this._treeAction);
[06:09:40] <Cork> thought remember that _treeAction won't have access to the widget "this" function
[06:09:45] <TimLoal> again no need, its just learning at this stage, getting it working is more important than getting it perfect, it can be pollished once proved
[06:10:04] <Cork> simplest solution would prob be to assign it to this.element.data('treeviewAction', this);
[06:10:08] <PCatinean> Is there a event fired when disabled is set to true or false or do I have to fire a custom event?
[06:10:15] <TimLoal> as long as it recieves the click even that will do
[06:10:18] <Cork> PCatinean: custom
[06:12:05] <TimLoal> ok let me get on all that before i gorget what i'm doing
[06:16:15] <TimLoal> cork is var base = this;  ok
[06:16:23] <Cork> TimLoal: sure
[06:16:34] <Cork> the normal term is self, but pick your choice
[06:17:09] <TimLoal> is 'me' ok?
[06:17:34] <Cork> TimLoal: it is a variable name, pick what you like :)
[06:20:20] <mehale> yo
[06:22:17] <mehale> folks, can you point me to a jquery module that can make a search widget like the one in left column on this page? http://goo.gl/dwLMLe
[06:23:34] <Cork> mehale: you most likely won't find a jquery plugin for that
[06:23:52] <Cork> mehale: those are parts of webstore cms plugins
[06:24:00] <mehale> would ou know the name of that kind of search?
[06:24:29] <Cork> the only web store i've used was ubercart
[06:24:40] <Cork> i luckely isn't doing that kind of work much
[06:24:49] <mehale> ok, I need to make something liek that to search a DB
[06:45:06] <TimLoal> cork: I've made the changes and all's good except the callback isn't called https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/5/
[06:45:47] <Cork> TimLoal: you add the function as part of the widget not to the jquery object
[06:46:29] <Cork> TimLoal: the jquery object is recreated on each query so things you add to that object is lost very quickly
[06:48:21] <TimLoal> mehale it wouldn't be easy but i'd enjoy the challange
[06:48:49] <mehale> not easy... I am postponing this project for a couple of years...
[06:49:27] <TimLoal> yes i still have confusion of whats the dom, whats js and whats the widget
[06:50:22] <TimLoal> in a couple of years there probably will be a widget or an automated system that will work it out for you
[06:51:15] <TimLoal> mehale what is the system you want to use it for?
[06:51:57] <mehale> frontend talks to server over socket.it
[06:52:00] <mehale> socket.io
[06:52:21] <TimLoal> cork i think its a lack of clarity with terms
[06:52:44] <TimLoal> widget means the base dom object?
[06:52:44] <mehale> I am looking for an easy way to create the form and have fancy ways to let user filter the data he wants
[06:53:01] <mehale> widget meaning the search form on the left
[06:53:19] <TimLoal> sorry that was to cork
[06:53:31] <TimLoal> cork widget means the base dom object?
[06:53:52] <TimLoal> mehale sounds like you need a decent widget
[06:54:35] <TimLoal> mehale where do you come into things in this picture? backend dev having to build a front end?
[06:57:23] <TimLoal> mehale that widget wouldn't be too hard
[06:59:06] <hellyeah> yo
[06:59:07] <TimLoal> merhale I'll be adding socket.io to this my project too, so it would serve us both if you wanted to colaborate
[07:00:13] <hellyeah> pls drop button onto another one it seems block i want to display them as inline how cn i do that şi try line 122-126 in css but no result http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/0s2s1uvf/7/
[07:04:31] <TimLoal> cork solved it failed to rename function on 42
[07:21:21] <_August_> Can someone help me out real quick, I updated jquery from 1.8.1 or something to 1.9.1 and now im getting an error "Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close'" this is the function its calling the error on. http://pastebin.com/e410abGW
[07:24:08] <_August_> nvm
[07:24:10] <_August_> i fixed it
[07:24:53] <TimLoal> often asking the question helps you ta answer it yourself
[07:26:13] <TimLoal> I worked in an office and my boss's desk was 10M away and most of the time i would walk half way over and answered my own question and walk back again
[07:26:54] <Cork> ya, having to formulate the question often forces you to think about the hole problem
[07:27:02] <TimLoal> if he was closer i would have interupted him moch more offten and wasted both our time
[07:27:03] <Cork> and in doing that answers the question, it is quite common
[07:27:20] <Cork> and why making a testcase before asking is often a good first step
[07:27:26] <Uhkis> http://duckie.me ftw
[07:30:02] <TimLoal> What should I call the function / object / thing that is misbehaving?
[07:30:02] <TimLoal> me
[07:30:02] <TimLoal> Can you explain what me does?
[07:30:02] <TimLoal> quality question! lol
[07:30:38] <TimLoal> yes i'm the problem :p
[07:31:38] <TimLoal> somehow i reckon thats one problem that will never be solved!
[07:32:47] <Uhkis> TimLoal: one can get pretty hilarious "conversations" with it :)
[07:36:41] <TimLoal> I'm be better off sticking with talking to the ducks in the park
[07:36:48] <TimLoal> that duck is quackers
[07:38:39] * hellyeah what the duck
[08:20:50] <TimLoal> Cork thanks for the help.  Once I've got my head around all this and have developed a widget and also standard jQ Plugins i will definitly document it and look to publish my widgets
[08:21:25] <TimLoal> I am actually toying with the idea of making the whole project open-source
[09:23:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i show my last progress ?
[09:25:06] <hellyeah> pls drag button and drop onto another and do this operation for different buttons also you can transfer one button to another by dropping onto appropriate button. Any suggestion highly appreciated. http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/0s2s1uvf/10/
[09:25:31] <Doel2> hey all, I´m trying to prevent a default action of a anchor link when clicked. It´s a anchor that jumps to the right id on the page. However I´ve tried both event.preventDefault() and return false; but it still seems to jump...
[09:25:56] <Doel2> I´ve tried all sorts of event binders and simple clicks
[09:25:57] <Doel2> none works
[09:26:55] <hellyeah> what about
[09:27:02] <hellyeah> stopProgonation() ?
[09:27:17] <Doel2> stopProgonation?
[09:27:18] <xec-> did you mean stopPregnancy()
[09:27:19] <Doel2> what does that do?
[09:27:45] <hellyeah> https://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[09:27:51] <Doel2> ah propagation
[09:27:58] <hellyeah> sorry for spelling
[09:28:07] <hellyeah> sometimes it is hard to keep that in mind
[09:28:22] <hellyeah> chec out the description
[09:28:24] <Doel2> nope it still jumps
[09:28:26] <Doel2> I tried it
[09:28:30] <hellyeah> ah
[09:28:38] <hellyeah> well fiddle could help
[09:28:40] <xec> return false; does the same as preventDefault + stopPropagation
[09:28:46] <Doel2> yeah sec I´ll post it on fiddle
[09:29:04] <hellyeah> also
[09:29:29] <hellyeah> ah
[09:29:35] <hellyeah> i have an idea now
[09:29:44] <hellyeah> attr('disabled', true);
[09:29:47] <hellyeah> that can work
[09:29:56] <hellyeah> i did it for sometimes
[09:30:00] <Doel2> hmm I´ll try
[09:30:06] <Doel2> wait let me put up a jsfiddle
[09:30:21] <hellyeah> sure
[09:31:38] <Doel2> https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/
[09:31:52] <Doel2> oh wait
[09:31:55] <Doel2> that´s not correct
[09:31:57] <Doel2> hold on
[09:32:22] <xec> https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/1/
[09:32:27] <xec> included jquery for you
[09:33:29] <hellyeah> well
[09:33:33] <hellyeah> one mistake i see
[09:33:49] <hellyeah> you didnt include jquery check console first
[09:33:56] <xec> :p
[09:34:11] <Doel2> https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/3/
[09:34:21] <Doel2> jquery check console?
[09:34:31] <Doel2> oh yeah
[09:34:35] <Doel2> have to include jquery
[09:34:35] <Doel2> sec
[09:35:01] <Doel2> https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/4/
[09:35:13] <Doel2> ok what the hell
[09:35:19] <xec> looks to me like you're just doing too much stuff https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/5/ works fine?
[09:35:23] <Doel2> it works here but not on my local site -,-
[09:35:30] <Doel2> what the hell
[09:36:10] <Doel2> that´s even without a event.preventDefault 0.o
[09:36:18] <Doel2> I don´t get it why it doesn´t want to work for me
[09:36:43] <hellyeah> i am wondering why prop("disabled", true); didnt work
[09:37:15] <Doel2> you mean attr?
[09:37:18] <Doel2> oh wait
[09:37:21] <Doel2> prop works aswell
[09:37:25] <Doel2> let me try it
[09:37:36] <Doel2> should I do this on doc ready?
[09:37:45] <Doel2> disable all the a links?
[09:38:02] <xec> why
[09:38:09] <hellyeah> try class
[09:38:22] <hellyeah> <a href .. class="..">
[09:38:52] <Doel2> yeah well it´s a wordpress website and I´m unable to alter the html of the parent theme
[09:39:00] <Doel2> so I´m not sure if I am allowed to do that
[09:39:40] <Doel2> what it does is it seems to jump to the anchor and then scroll a tiny bit
[09:39:54] <xec> maybe there are other event handlers on the wordpress site? or maybe you dont have jquery included properly?
[09:39:57] <Doel2> so the scrolltop animate seems to work but the default action also keeps on going
[09:40:06] <Doel2> could be...
[09:40:06] <Cork> Doel2: you should NOT set disabled with attr()
[09:40:11] <Doel2> ok
[09:40:15] <Doel2> I´ll do it with prop
[09:40:19] <Cork> attr is for modifying attributes, not dom properties
[09:40:41] <Cork> and browsers doesn't always have listeners for attribute changes to change the dom state
[09:40:46] <Cork> so it breaks if you use attr
[09:40:58] <Doel2> even with disabled on true it still jumps
[09:41:08] <Doel2> with prop
[09:41:09] <Doel2> that is
[09:41:16] <Cork> links don't have disabled
[09:41:22] <Cork> (just scrolled up to the question)
[09:41:28] <Cork> disabled only exists of form elements
[09:41:30] <Doel2> that´s what I thought but hellyeah told me otherwise
[09:41:31] <hellyeah> well i didnt know that
[09:41:36] <Doel2> oh
[09:41:39] <Doel2> ok xD
[09:41:41] <hellyeah> i am sorry Doel1
[09:41:50] <Doel2> I´m doel2
[09:41:54] <Doel2> :P
[09:41:56] <hellyeah> ops
[09:41:58] <hellyeah> .D:D:D
[09:41:59] <Cork> give me a min to read the question again
[09:42:08] <Doel2> thanks Cork
[09:42:10] <Doel1> but im here as well...
[09:42:15] <xec> fwiw this should work fine https://jsfiddle.net/1Ly8ta6m/8/
[09:42:17] <taplar> lol
[09:42:23] <hellyeah> he just want to disable a element
[09:42:38] <Doel2> it ¨should¨
[09:42:42] <Doel2> for me it doesn´t :)
[09:42:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  i tried my chance :D
[09:42:45] <Doel2> that´s my issue
[09:42:48] <Cork> Doel2: make a jsfiddle cause event.preventDefault() should work
[09:43:04] <Doel2> I already made one but I can do it again, I think it has something to do with my wordpress site
[09:43:06] <hellyeah> xec:  link worked
[09:43:21] <xec> Cork: he already made a fiddle, and it works, but doesnt work on his original site (...)
[09:43:21] <hellyeah> ops
[09:43:29] <hellyeah> Doel2:  xec's fiddle worked
[09:43:32] <Cork> ah
[09:43:37] <Cork> long convo >_<
[09:43:41] <xec> yeah :D
[09:43:57] <Doel2> yup :P seems to not work on my site but it does work on jsfiddle
[09:43:58] <Cork> Doel2: it might be they bind a click handler and does the id movement with js
[09:43:58] <Doel2> awesome
[09:44:01] <Cork> it is quite likely
[09:44:06] <hellyeah> Doel2:   what console said in your original site? may be it is about wordpress
[09:44:07] <Doel2> yeah that could be true
[09:44:09] <Cork> and then the preventDefault won't do anything
[09:44:12] <Doel2> how can I remove all click handlers?
[09:44:17] <Doel2> it might be my theme or something
[09:44:25] <Doel2> that does this
[09:44:25] <Cork> that is VERY hard to answer
[09:44:40] <Cork> as it might be bound on a long list of difference ways
[09:44:51] <Doel2> hmmm
[09:45:08] <Doel2> can I somehow see which event handlers are bound to the element?
[09:45:12] <Uhkis> $('*').off('click'); sounds like a working horrible way :D
[09:45:12] <Doel2> and where they come from?
[09:45:17] <Cork> ya, but it isn't just on the element
[09:45:18] <Doel2> indeed
[09:45:20] <Cork> it can be on any parent
[09:45:39] <Doel2> hmmm, kinda hard to debug then
[09:45:40] <Cork> that is what makes it hard
[09:45:44] <Cork> ya
[09:46:09] <hellyeah> why you want to prevent happening anyway?
[09:46:15] <Cork> best option is prob to search through the js libs it includes (and yes i know that is a horrible suggestion)
[09:46:19] <Doel2> because I want a smoothscroll to occur instead
[09:46:25] <xec> since stopPropagation (and return false) didnt help, it shouldnt be a delegate causing the issue
[09:46:47] <xec> assuming you actually select the <a> directly like in the jsfiddle
[09:46:49] <Doel2> so in other words I need to go through all my wordpress scripts?
[09:47:06] <Doel2> this is gonna be one hell of a job
[09:47:08] <Cork> hmm
[09:47:16] <hellyeah> select element with id or class
[09:47:18] <Cork> actually it might be they are using mouseup
[09:47:25] <Doel2> it doesn´t have an id or class
[09:47:26] <Cork> and not click
[09:47:35] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:47:42] <xec> right, thats a good point
[09:47:59] <Cork> i've seen script solutions trap mouseup and tap
[09:48:07] <Cork> for "mobile speedy link clicks"
[09:48:12] <xec> so, search through all js code for "mouse" and "click" glhf .D
[09:48:18] <Doel2> :(
[09:48:20] <Cork> ya...
[09:48:21] <Doel2> okay
[09:48:25] <hellyeah> trap mouseup and tap what does that mean?
[09:48:32] <Doel2> I´ll use some unix for that
[09:48:46] <xec> trap = "listen", tap is like you do on your phone
[09:48:49] <hellyeah> Doel2:  comment out your code
[09:48:50] <Cork> Doel2: you could try $().on('mouseup', function(event) { event.stopPropagation() });
[09:48:53] <Cork> it MIGHT work
[09:48:55] <hellyeah> and try from beginning to end
[09:48:57] <hellyeah> :D
[09:49:19] <Cork> but ya, there is a reason why i'm not a fan of cms systems ^^'
[09:49:20] <Doel2> I´ll try that Cork
[09:49:32] <Cork> do much unknown junk outside of your control
[09:49:36] <Cork> *too
[09:50:07] <Doel2> lol nope still jumps :D
[09:50:14] <Doel2> with the mouseup
[09:50:15] <Cork> weird...
[09:50:24] <Cork> mousedown?
[09:50:25] <Cork> -_-'
[09:50:28] <Doel2> let me try
[09:50:30] <Doel2> would be stupid
[09:50:32] <Doel2> but yeah who knows
[09:50:54] <Doel2> nope, still jumps
[09:50:59] <hellyeah> something on yourscript may prevent that
[09:51:00] <Doel2> I have no idea what is going on
[09:51:19] <Doel2> I could post the entire script....
[09:51:34] <hellyeah> how many lines :D
[09:51:55] <Doel2> https://jsfiddle.net/41nu7cc0/
[09:51:57] <Doel2> not that much
[09:51:58] <Doel2> a few
[09:52:04] <Doel2> 45
[09:52:23] <Cork> oh.. ouch rip secure boot >_>
[09:52:34] <Cork> the golden key is leaked ^^'
[09:52:50] <hellyeah> why you define var outsie document ready
[09:53:03] <xec> $().on('mousedown' <-- not gonna work
[09:53:06] <Doel2> dunno, shouldn´t I? it shouldn´t matter
[09:53:12] <xec> $() was just short for the selector you were using
[09:53:20] <Doel2> xec yeah that was just a test from Cork
[09:53:27] <xec> in your case it should be $('a')
[09:53:29] <hellyeah> what the
[09:53:30] <hellyeah> $()
[09:53:34] <hellyeah> what is it?
[09:53:43] <xec> it looks like a frog with sunglasses
[09:53:49] <hellyeah> :ppp
[09:53:53] <Cork> lol
[09:53:56] <Doel2> I added ´a´ in there
[09:53:58] <Doel2> didn´t work :P
[09:54:12] <xec> and mouseup? :D
[09:54:18] <Doel2> both
[09:54:19] <hellyeah> check your console
[09:54:22] <Doel2> didn´t make a difference
[09:54:28] <hellyeah> you have variable error
[09:54:30] <xec> shotgun debugging
[09:54:39] <xec> try all the things
[09:54:40] <Doel2> I got one 404 for something called teal but not sure
[09:54:49] <Doel2> doesn´t seem to do anything
[09:55:01] <Doel2> I don´t have any variable errors
[09:55:16] <hellyeah> fiddle.jshell.net/41nu7cc0/show/:45 Uncaught ReferenceError: php_params is not defined
[09:55:21] <hellyeah> this is i have btw
[09:55:43] <Doel2> could it have something to do with the url changing? window.location.href?
[09:56:07] <xec> yeah there could be an event listener on hashchange
[09:56:21] <xec> maybe
[09:56:29] <Doel2> perhaps..
[09:56:30] <xec> i'm gonna go back to work now, good luck
[09:56:37] <Doel2> thanks for trying to help
[09:56:38] <hellyeah> in your fiddle
[09:56:45] <Doel2> huh? wait up
[09:56:47] <Doel2> let me checkl
[09:56:49] <hellyeah> you didnt include jquery
[09:56:49] <printForever> http://imgur.com/gallery/QVWU4
[09:57:11] <Doel2> oh yeah well I have jquery included in my wordpress installation
[09:57:24] <Doel2> and the variable php_params comes from a value passed to javascript from wordpress
[09:57:31] <Doel2> which works perfectly
[09:59:21] <Doel2> I´m going insane >.<
[09:59:24] <Doel2> why doesn´t it work :S
[09:59:45] <Cork> hmm
[09:59:54] <hellyeah> what is php_params
[09:59:55] <hellyeah> ?
[09:59:56] <Cork> Doel2: it might be the link is added through javascript
[10:00:07] <Doel2> oh yeah good point Cork
[10:00:11] <Doel2> I think it is actually
[10:00:13] <Cork> Doel2: have you tried $(document).on('click', 'a', func) ?
[10:00:21] <Doel2> nope I haven´t let me try that
[10:00:33] <Doel2> inside the document.ready or outside?
[10:00:38] <Cork> doesn't matter
[10:00:56] <Cork> Doel2: btw use $(document).on('click', 'a[href^="#"]', func)
[10:01:01] <Cork> then you don't need the hash check
[10:01:05] <Doel2> oh yeah
[10:01:06] <Doel2> thanks
[10:01:08] <Doel2> let me try
[10:02:30] <Doel2> still jumps -,-
[10:02:36] <Cork> :/
[10:02:43] <Doel2> https://jsfiddle.net/41nu7cc0/1/
[10:02:45] <Doel2> I used this
[10:03:03] <Cork> heh...
[10:03:18] <Cork> try removing the [] in the selector
[10:03:20] <Cork> just to test...
[10:03:24] <Cork> cause this is getting nuts
[10:03:24] <Doel2> just a?
[10:03:29] <Doel2> it is isn´t it -,-
[10:03:29] <Cork> ya
[10:03:41] <Doel1> ´;..;´
[10:03:57] <Doel2> wait perhaps it has something to do with wordpress´s cache
[10:04:03] <Doel2> sometimes it doesn´t update properly
[10:04:05] <Cork> ah
[10:04:08] <Doel2> I think I´ll have to clear my browser cache
[10:04:09] <Doel2> sec
[10:04:55] <Doel2> clearing all caches
[10:05:12] <Doel2> nope, still jumps -,-
[10:05:18] <Doel2> this is insane >.<
[10:05:22] <Cork> heh...
[10:05:42] <Doel2> perhaps the objects don´t exist on document ready?
[10:05:56] <Cork> objects?
[10:06:03] <Cork> what objects?
[10:06:20] <Cork> Doel2: hmm, what version of jquery are you using?
[10:06:31] <Cork> ($.jquery will tell you)
[10:06:49] <Doel2> let me check
[10:07:04] <shoky> ( $.fn.jquery )
[10:07:13] <Doel2> do I put it in a console.log?
[10:07:17] <Doel2> I think it´s an old version
[10:07:22] <Cork> or jus run it in the console
[10:07:22] <Doel2> that could be the reason why
[10:07:25] <Doel2> ok
[10:07:57] <Doel2> cannot read property ´fn´ of undefined
[10:08:10] <Doel2> even though jquery is in there
[10:08:26] <Cork> Doel2: try jQuery.fn.jquery
[10:08:40] <Cork> i think wordpress run noConflict
[10:08:44] <Doel2> in my head of my html I see: jquery.js?ver=1.12.4
[10:09:04] <Doel2> yeah it´s 1.12.4
[10:09:08] <Cork> ok
[10:09:23] <Cork> so ya, then the selectors are fine so...
[10:09:27] <Cork> yay...
[10:09:44] <Doel2> yeah wordpress does run noConflict, you´re right about that
[10:10:12] <Doel2> btw if I click on the a tags real quick it seems to not jump
[10:10:22] <Doel2> only when I wait till clicking for like a second it jumps
[10:11:29] <Dan39> i am getting Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[@name='Service Status']
[10:11:36] <Cork> ah
[10:11:43] <Cork> that might be the cause
[10:11:49] <Cork> cause it breaks js execution
[10:11:50] <Dan39> what would be the cause? i have tried changing a few things without any luck. thnaks
[10:11:57] <Cork> remove the @
[10:12:15] <Cork> that is xpath not css
[10:12:16] <Doel2> I have to go in a few minutes
[10:12:20] <Doel2> I will work on it tomorrow
[10:14:03] <Doel2> hmmm so whenever I click on it and I set window.location.hash = this.hash it displays #undefined
[10:14:10] <Doel2> somehow the hash isn´t defined? :S
[10:14:15] <Doel2> that could be the cause...
[10:14:44] <Cork> ya, check console.log(this.hash)
[10:15:05] <Doel2> ok sec
[10:15:42] <Doel2> nevermind works fine
[10:15:44] <Doel2> it´s something else
[10:16:01] <Cork> Doel2: fix the js error you saw before
[10:16:09] <Cork> it might be as simple as that
[10:16:13] <Cork> never leave js errors
[10:16:18] <Doel2> the one with the teal thingy?
[10:16:21] <Doel2> not sure where it comes from :S
[10:16:34] <Cork> well it breaks your js so you better look it up >_>
[10:16:52] <Cork> if you're unlucky it prevents the hooks from getting bound
[10:16:56] <Cork> and that is why nothing works
[10:17:01] <slax0r> never leave errors - fixed that for ya
[10:17:13] <Doel2> eeerm well all the other js works and the error is a 404, not a js error
[10:17:42] <Cork> Doel2: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[@name='Service Status'] is not a 404
[10:18:01] <Doel2> erm that´s not my error, that was someone elses
[10:18:02] <Doel2> :P
[10:18:16] <Doel2> Dan39
[10:18:19] <slax0r> :D
[10:18:19] <Cork> ugg >_<'
[10:18:20] <Doel2> not Doel2
[10:18:20] <Cork> sorry
[10:18:28] <Cork> ya, close enough though...
[10:18:30] <Cork> :P
[10:18:33] <Doel2> true
[10:18:37] <Doel2> I gotta go guys
[10:18:41] <Doel2> I´m already over-working
[10:18:49] <Doel2> I´ll continue tomorrow
[10:18:54] <Doel2> cya
[10:19:01] <Dan39> o i see
[10:19:04] <Dan39> derp
[10:19:23] <Dan39> im used to do xpath :P i looked at the jquery example like 5 times and didnt notice they werent using @
[10:19:49] <Cork> Dan39: jquery used to support xpath up until like 1.7
[10:20:07] <Cork> then it was dropped (and ya xpath is horrible so...)
[10:20:30] <Dan39> BLASPHEMY
[10:20:34] <Dan39> i love me some xpath
[10:20:42] <Dan39> but i use that in php w/ lxml
[10:20:44] <Dan39> err
[10:20:46] <Dan39> python
[10:20:48] <Cork> sure it might be nice in looks, but cause of how it is designed
[10:20:51] <Dan39> but ive used it in php already
[10:20:53] <Cork> it is horribly slow
[10:21:04] <Dan39> hmm
[10:21:18] <Dan39> xpath with lxml is fast..
[10:21:30] <Dan39> that is, xslt/libxml2 i think
[10:21:41] <Cork> last i checked xpath is ~20-30 times slower then css selectors
[10:21:48] <Cork> in most languages that support both
[10:21:54] <Dan39> bummer
[10:22:31] <Dan39> well im fine with jquery's selection style, its similar enough
[10:22:46] <Cork> well xpath was designed to be able to pick anything, where access was more important then speed
[10:23:03] <Cork> cause you made a selecton and then you just worked with the result set
[10:23:19] <Cork> while css speed is the important part, as you normally run it over and over again as things change
[10:23:24] <Dan39> i just hated beuatifulsoup/other libs methods of using a ton of functions like getElementByID('id') instead of '#id'
[10:23:39] <Cork> ya
[10:24:04] <Cork> it is quite common for developers to be obsessed with ids
[10:24:09] <Cork> never really figured out why
[10:24:22] <Dan39> doing '#id' seems so much quicker/better to me than remembering 20 different functions like getelementbyclass/id/attribute etc.
[10:24:37] <Cork> ah, you meant like that...
[10:24:38] <Dan39> but the functions are more noob friendly i guess
[10:25:00] <Cork> well getElementById is much MUCH older in support then querySelector
[10:25:03] <Cork> and that is why
[10:25:13] <Dan39> you dont have to spend 30 seconds learning that '#something' means get by id, you can look at the function name and know what it does i guess
[10:25:29] <Dan39> thats what i figured the reasoning is
[10:25:31] <Cork> no it isn't about that
[10:25:34] <Dan39> o
[10:25:51] <Dan39> its just because it was around before the selector stuff? ah
[10:25:56] <Cork> getElementBy id was added to dom in 95-97 ish
[10:26:04] <Cork> querySelector is around 2006
[10:26:10] <Dan39> i see
[10:26:17] <Dan39> that explains a lot
[10:26:31] <Cork> getElementById is about as old as document.write :)
[10:26:35] <Cork> that might give a hint XD
[10:31:48] <BetaFrey> Dan39:  you mean getElementById('id') vs just #id?
[10:31:58] <Cork> yes he did
[10:32:45] <BetaFrey> I always get the #id's mixed up with my syntax in other languages
[10:33:42] <BetaFrey> Always think it means binding like in <%# thinghere %>
[10:34:36] <islalobo> I'm doing a search and filtering/searching through json data. I'm struggling to find a way to determine if a given string is contained in the json data. I can only achieve exact matches
[10:36:40] <TimLoal> islalobo sounds like something for a "regular expression" which matches patterns
[10:36:56] <hellyeah> ls drag button and drop onto another and do this operation for different buttons also you can transfer one button to another by dropping onto appropriate button. Any suggestion highly appreciated. http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/0s2s1uvf/10/
[10:37:06] <TimLoal> you'll have to google on it though as i don't use them
[10:37:53] <Cork> islalobo: by json do you really mean json or a javascript object?
[10:38:06] <Cork> cause if you're searching in json it is just a big string
[10:39:56] <islalobo> @Cork http://kopy.io/dPm8d json
[10:40:21] <islalobo> Thanks TimLoal
[10:40:36] <Cork> islalobo: so your working with data not json?
[10:40:47] <Cork> cause json is a javascript object and data is json
[10:40:57] <Cork> '{}' <-- json
[10:41:03] <Cork> {} <-- javascript object
[10:41:03] <TimLoal> islalobo yw
[10:41:35] <Cork> but ya, the code explains
[10:42:18] <islalobo> Thank you for the clarification :)
[10:42:28] <Cork> so what you want is .indexOf
[10:42:44] <Cork> islalobo: it makes quite a bit of difference for the answer, that is why
[10:42:59] <islalobo> No, I appreciate it! I'm the worst at using incorrect terms
[10:43:06] <islalobo> And, causing confusion
[10:43:11] <islalobo> Googling .indexOf
[10:43:27] <Cork> islalobo: so if(obj.brand_name.indexOf(searchString) > -1)
[10:43:29] <Cork> should be what you want
[10:44:33] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[10:44:36] <kossae> or JSON.parse() to turn it into an object if other processing is needed
[10:47:38] <hellyeah> indexOf will return index number of specified index
[10:50:37] <islalobo> No, that works :)
[10:51:08] <islalobo> If there is a match I can then display whatever I want ex. obj.brand_name: obj.din
[10:51:15] <islalobo> +Cork
[10:51:26] <islalobo> +1 Cork
[11:00:21] <yuriy_> hi
[11:03:14] <ksm101> Hello
[11:03:44] <cmrabet> Hi all
[11:04:40] <cmrabet> I'v created a method that sends an array with AJAX to the backend (http://pastebin.com/bbiW0K5m). Whenever I call it from my jQuery code like so $.setConfig(myconfig) I see in the console that the method is called multiple times infinetely!!! what is wrong with it?
[11:05:23] <cmrabet> I only call it once with $.setConfig(myconfig), but it ends up being called again and again, how is this possible?
[11:06:17] <cmrabet> I call the method in an .on('change'...) for a select box
[11:07:19] <cmrabet> The on('change'..) where I'm calling it is at: http://pastebin.com/cWys5tgL
[11:08:00] <cmrabet> Anyone can help? I'm going crazy with this
[11:16:02] <ksm101> have you tried this way ? ->  $(yourSelectors).change(function(){ ... });
[11:16:52] <ksm101> http://codepen.io/ksm101/pen/kXzjLW
[11:18:00] <shoky> cmrabet: there's nothing in the code you pasted that shows that problem. looks fine, so problem must be in some other code you haven't showed, or the problem is different than you describe ;p
[11:19:20] <cmrabet> shoky: when the $.setConfig(config) line is fired inside the ..on('change',..) event, I see in chrome console that the ajax success message is written over and over for hundreds of times until I kill chrome
[11:19:52] <shoky> cmrabet: does the console show those logs you're logging
[11:20:01] <cmrabet> shoky: yes
[11:20:09] <cmrabet> let me put in pastebin a sample
[11:20:11] <cmrabet> hold on
[11:20:12] <shoky> also the 'change' one?
[11:20:14] <shoky> console.log('test changed');
[11:20:18] <cmrabet> yep
[11:20:22] <shoky> you see that multiple times?
[11:20:26] <cmrabet> yep
[11:20:36] <cmrabet> hold on, I'll copy part of the console in pastebin
[11:20:40] <shoky> then the change event is being fired multiple times maybe..
[11:20:52] <shoky> has nothing to do with your $.setConfig then
[11:22:34] <cmrabet> shoky: I know, but I'm firing the event from one place only
[11:22:49] <shoky> so you say ;)
[11:24:37] <cmrabet> http://pasteboard.co/7oJSObcgh.png
[11:24:43] <cmrabet> check that screenshoot
[11:24:46] <cmrabet> it shows the console
[11:25:05] <cmrabet> I had to kill the node server (backend) in order to make it stop
[11:25:36] <cmrabet> shoky: all you see in that console capture happened when I called the event only once
[11:25:50] <snover> what is a _graphWidget?
[11:27:43] <cmrabet> snover: I have several divs that contain Flot graphs, I implement their behavior with jQuery by iterating along them with $('div.graphWidgetAscan').each(function(){...}, inside this loop, I define _graphWidget=$(this)
[11:28:23] <cmrabet> snover: all the methods related to each one of these graphs, are inside that each loop and reference to _graphWidget.
[11:28:29] <cmrabet> I have 4 of these widgets in total
[11:28:38] <snover> if you are confused about what is calling your function, set a breakpoint and look at the stack
[11:28:58] <shoky> cmrabet: well that's weird but still, the code you showed looks fine, problem is in code you haven't shown
[11:29:11] <shoky> yea was gonna suggest a breakpoint
[11:29:33] <cmrabet> snover: the thing is that if I just comment the $.ajax call, all the console.logs I have set to debug the code happen only once, .. it's when I uncoment the ajax call when shit starts happening, that's what confused me.
[11:30:00] <cmrabet> If I was calling multiple times the ajax by mistake, I should see the console logs even with the ajax code commented, right'
[11:30:37] <cmrabet> I meant: If I was calling multiple times the ajax by mistake, I should see the console logs MULTIPLE TIMES even with the ajax code commented, right'
[11:31:12] <cmrabet> ok, let me comment the $.ajax call
[11:31:17] <shoky> put a breakpoint (or `debugger;` statement) in that function and look at the call stack
[11:32:29] <cmrabet> ok
[11:32:32] <cmrabet> look at this: http://pasteboard.co/7oS9KrMgr.png
[11:32:36] <cmrabet> no repetition,
[11:32:40] <cmrabet> the only thing I did was this:
[11:33:12] <cmrabet> http://pastebin.com/0nukrDec
[11:34:20] <cmrabet> by commenting the ajax call, the setConfig function doesn't get called multiple times
[11:35:52] <cmrabet> the ajax call is inserting an object into the html tag via .data().. could that be making the document to update and therefore calling again ?
[11:35:57] <shoky> not making much sense.. missing some piece in the puzzle.. are you using some framework that's altering jquery maybe.. what browser is that btw
[11:36:53] <cmrabet> shoky: this is Chrome
[11:37:06] <cmrabet> shoky: I'm not using any other framework, however I'm using bootstrap plugins
[11:37:20] <shoky> that's chrome's console?
[11:37:26] <cmrabet> I can paste the rest of the code, but it's long, if you are willing to see it then I'll do it
[11:37:59] <shoky> i'm willing to see it, dono how much i'll actually read ;p
[11:38:25] <shoky> never seen chrome look like that. what os?
[11:38:37] <shoky> maybe i'm just clueless
[11:38:58] <cmrabet> shoky: that was Safari, with Chrome I get the same results, I have both open and I test with both
[11:39:23] <cmrabet> Chrome's console shows the same crazy repetitions
[11:39:58] <shoky> welp, try a breakpoint
[11:40:53] <cmrabet> shoky: ok, here you go, main script where I handle the widget that holds a Flot graph : http://pastebin.com/bNcX3GjX
[11:41:23] <shoky> ok, you gonnna try a breakpoint? :)
[11:41:32] <cmrabet> shoky: the line in question, where I'm calling the $.setConfig() function, is 457
[11:42:11] <cmrabet> shoky: now, $.setConfig() and $.getConfig() are 2 functions that I have defined in another script that I call in the header before any other one and after jQuery, its content is at:
[11:42:40] <shoky> cmrabet: uhm i see you're calling $.setConfig from various places...
[11:42:41] <cmrabet> http://pastebin.com/rRPfivL8
[11:43:07] <cmrabet> shoky: yes, because I have several events that need to update the configuration, but each one of them happens at one time
[11:43:22] <shoky> are you sure?  put console.logs in each of them
[11:44:07] <cmrabet> shoky: ok, I would think of that if the repretitions were 3 or 4 o 10, but unlimited? forever?
[11:44:40] <cmrabet> shoky: also remember that when I comment the $.ajax call, I don't see the repetitions
[11:44:47] <shoky> does it hurt you to put a console.log? why even ask about it
[11:45:02] <cmrabet> shoky: I'm doing it now.. I was just saying
[11:45:12] <shoky> there's nothing to say
[11:45:22] <shoky> neither of us has any idae what the problem is or what the cause is
[11:45:24] <shoky> :)
[11:45:32] <shoky> so putting a log can't be a bad idea
[11:45:54] <cmrabet> $.setConfig() has a console.log('setconfig called'); if $.setConfig was being called from multiple times, shouldn't that console.log appear multiple times even if I commented out the $.ajax call?
[11:46:30] <shoky> obviously the $.ajax call has SOMETHING to do with it. e.g. something about it could cause an event to be triggered, causing setConfig to be called again...
[11:46:36] <shoky> a console.log would show that right away
[11:47:05] <cmrabet> shoky: ok, so I'm putting a console.log in every place I call $.setConfig
[11:47:08] <shoky> .... or a breakpoint :)
[11:49:34] <cmrabet> done
[11:49:42] <cmrabet> not a single call from that file
[11:49:58] <cmrabet> all the console logs I get are from the file where the $.setConfig function is implemented
[11:51:48] <shoky> btw just to make sure,  before i asked if you see the 'test changed'  log  multiple times and you said yep
[11:51:58] <shoky> you didn't mean it right ?
[11:52:41] <cmrabet> shoky: sorry, no I don't see it multiple times, what I see multiple times is "setconfig called" and "config sent", both defined in $.setConfig()
[11:53:50] <shoky> oks.. no idea at all :)  did you try that breakpoint yet...
[11:54:07] <cmrabet> shoky: I'm working on it
[11:55:35] <cmrabet> shoky: things I found so far: I confirmed the $.setConfig method happens only once when the .on('change'..) event is triggered. Then I commented the console.logs under success, and I could see that the console.log('setconfig called') starts appearing over and over. Its like the jQuery.setConfig gets called by itself after the first call from the change event
[11:56:10] <cmrabet> under success === under -$.ajax({success:function(){}});
[12:11:18] <shoky> cmrabet: one thing i see in your logs is that 'channel changed' is logged in the middle there.  if we assume that the log ordering is maybe off, could be that the channel change is being triggered maybe due to the test change? cause i see you modify it in updateChannelSelector and call refresh on it
[12:16:25] <shoky> tho that has nothing to do with the ajax. no idea
[12:17:56] <TimLoal> can someone help me clear up a little confusion with jQuery widget options and defaults ...
[12:18:13] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal absolutely can :) share up your code and we can help
[12:18:16] <shoky> only if you ask
[12:18:54] <TimLoal> just give you a heads up
[12:19:09] <TimLoal> thats it i havent or possibly have already
[12:19:46] <shoky> yessir
[12:20:06] <TimLoal> https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/9/
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal oh... you've included jquery twice tjhere.
[12:21:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fu2yctog/10/
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> here - fixed that up.
[12:21:51] <TimLoal> ok my issue, there is an options element, with what in my mind are the defaults for the object
[12:22:08] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd open your console real quick.
[12:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a } somewhjere.
[12:22:29] <TimLoal> and options objects passed to the constructor are handled by the widget
[12:22:54] <TimLoal> it might be an older version
[12:23:04] <TimLoal> don't worry bob
[12:23:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:23:16] <TimLoal> its just to 'see the code'
[12:23:20] <robertmaxrees> valid code would be nice ;)
[12:23:53] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[12:24:23] <TimLoal> being on topic would be nice
[12:24:31] <shoky> help is the topic
[12:24:32] <TimLoal> but ... cheese and bred
[12:25:04] <TimLoal> sub-topic ie my question
[12:25:08] <TimLoal> boundries are useful
[12:25:29] <shoky> topic is more important than sub-topic i think you'll agree
[12:26:07] <TimLoal> sub-topics by definition are on topic
[12:26:10] <robertmaxrees> being blatantly disrespectful towards me isn't going to get you very far duder.
[12:26:11] <shoky> anyway..
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, the second arg for the widget facrtory is supposed to be a constructor.
[12:27:52] <robertmaxrees> oh that's an optional arg that's right.
[12:27:54] <TimLoal> sorry robertmaxrees i don't find your conversations with me productive, so will refrain from conversation with you, if you please, do the same
[12:27:55] <robertmaxrees> been a while.
[12:28:15] <shoky> yay, refrain
[12:28:20] <TimLoal> ok my issue, there is an options element, with what in my mind are the defaults for the object
[12:29:06] <TimLoal> and options objects passed to the constructor are handled(merged with the (default)options) by the widget
[12:29:10] <ssquirrel> lol
[12:31:13] <TimLoal> anyone up for my on topic sub-topic or is the pissing contest still going on?
[12:31:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm done here.
[12:31:38] <ssquirrel> sorry there is a russian war
[12:31:43] <shoky> :o

[12:33:48] * taplar_ needs to read the channel
[12:35:57] <ssquirrel> eh? I haven't seen any changes as to an object refrence that have properties other than changing jquery no conflict
[12:37:20] <shoky> eh?
[12:37:42] <ssquirrel> "floatbox"
[12:37:54] <ssquirrel> lol
[12:38:09] <shoky> ...
[12:38:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:39:42] <cmrabet> shoky: sorry, I was away for lunch, I'll check the channel thing, thanks
[12:40:47] <ssquirrel> ... I spent many many hours with no avail... on a combination of implementing the floatbox project  with $_post and $_get
[12:41:26] <ssquirrel> it required jquery no conflict AFTER the version was updated
[12:41:27] <ssquirrel> lol
[12:41:29] <Uhkis> those look like php variables
[12:41:45] <ssquirrel> they are
[12:42:08] <ssquirrel> it's a drag an drop illustration
[12:42:24] <ssquirrel> nobody uses it.. lol
[12:42:54] <ssquirrel> verboten

[12:43:53] <cmrabet> the issue is in another script where a socket event fires when one of the variables in the config changes..
[13:02:13] <shoky> cmrabet: yah .. call stack ftw ;p
[13:02:44] <cmrabet> shoky: I did a console.trace and then all those calls from the other script popped out, thanks for your help!
[13:03:04] <shoky> yw
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:26:11] <ssquirrel> wow those ppl were old
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:27:02] <ssquirrel> zzz
[14:55:07] * taplar_ crickets
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> shhhh
[14:55:18] <robertmaxrees> it's beautiful.
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> so quiet.
[14:55:22] <robertmaxrees> no drama.
[14:55:24] <taplar_> lol
[14:55:31] <robertmaxrees> such quiet.  so peace.  wow.
[14:55:56] <taplar_> or we're all being affected by carbon monoxide
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> or BOTH
[14:56:21] * taplar_ is apparently dark when he has an underscore
[14:56:31] <robertmaxrees> hrmm?
[14:57:15] <taplar_> ah, just making fun of my _
[14:57:20] <Uhkis> taplar_: come back to jquery then!
[14:57:40] <taplar_> got shnit to do, :(
[14:58:37] <Uhkis> (it was a reference to underscore.js in case you missed it)
[14:58:59] <taplar_> lol
[14:58:59] <taplar_> sorry
[15:00:53] <robertmaxrees> the more i use and tweak vs code, the more i really like it.
[15:00:54] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[15:01:14] <Uhkis> vs code?
[15:02:16] <robertmaxrees> microsoft's answer to sublime/atom/etc
[15:02:27] <robertmaxrees> has full intellisense support and other neat features.
[15:02:31] <robertmaxrees> but still really light.
[15:03:12] <taplar_> dumb question.  open source?
[15:03:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:03:32] <taplar_> or paid program?
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> on github, evem.
[15:03:38] <robertmaxrees> *even
[15:03:40] <Uhkis> whaat?
[15:03:49] <robertmaxrees> yo MS has gotten WAY open source friendly.
[15:04:02] <robertmaxrees> .NET core was completely open sourced not that long ago.
[15:04:16] <robertmaxrees> same with their JS engine.
[15:04:51] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode
[15:05:28] <taplar_> might have to give it a try
[15:05:57] <taplar_> i'd dig a sublime like product without the occasional 'buy me' popups
[15:06:02] <Uhkis> oh, node
[15:06:14] <robertmaxrees> built using electron, yeah.
[15:06:22] <robertmaxrees> but it's awesome.  i use it for our node and CF stuff.
[15:06:37] <robertmaxrees> tons of great plugins, too.  full debugger so you can hook into node's debug port and go to town.
[15:07:19] <taplar_> is it able to do the quick access between functions, like the ctrl+click?
[15:07:20] <robertmaxrees> about the only thing is doesn't do very well that sublime nailed fast file search.
[15:07:27] <taplar_> or shift+click, whatever
[15:07:30] <Uhkis> too bad all my code is on the server
[15:07:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah - can even show you definitions on hover.
[15:07:46] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis what language are you usign server-side?
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar_ full itellisense support means it can be set to scan your codebase and let you peek at definitions.
[15:08:35] <Uhkis> does it matter? afaik there's no stable sshfs for win10
[15:08:41] <taplar_> yep, going to have to give it a try
[15:08:58] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis not writing code on local boxes?
[15:10:24] <Uhkis> well yeah, but the local box is the desktop computer and couch + laptop is way more comfy :D
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaah hahaha.
[15:10:40] <taplar_> hear that
[15:10:41] <Uhkis> and obviously i love vim
[15:10:49] <robertmaxrees> i do something similar with my setup - but it's windows -> windows.
[15:10:56] <taplar_> whole reason i keep thinking of getting a chromebook or something
[15:13:37] <NoiseEee> Uhkis: join the VM world man, dev on your couch
[15:14:35] <Uhkis> NoiseEee: then buy me more ram!
[15:16:25] <Uhkis> and in case you missed it, i'm already deving on couch
[15:18:47] <taplar_> i like to try to dev on my couch, but then the tv comes on and things go down hill
[15:19:14] <arc_> does anyone know how much space windows subsystem for linux takes up
[15:19:43] <taplar_> you mean like making a windows vm inside linux?
[15:20:08] <arc_> no i mean like the thing microsoft added to windows 10 in the anniversary update where you can basically run the ubuntu commandline natively within windows
[15:20:22] <taplar_> ah, no clue
[15:21:01] <Uhkis> taplar_: your tv comes on to you?! :D
[15:21:04] <taplar_> i use vmplayer myself
[15:21:17] <taplar_> big time
[15:21:31] <arc_> guess i'll try it out
[15:21:43] <arc_> right now c: has 207gb in use
[15:22:12] <Uhkis> just remove those illegal downloads!
[15:22:16] <taplar_> i usually give my linux vms like 60gb, but i believe the 'recommended' minimum is 30 or 40
[15:22:34] <taplar_> probabaly depends on your flavor though
[15:22:36] <robertmaxrees> with the ubuntu on windows thing, you probably won't need those vms nearly as much.
[15:23:10] <taplar_> does the windows thing still function as a sandbox?
[15:23:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean the command line?
[15:23:32] <taplar_> ya
[15:23:32] <arc_> still 207gb
[15:23:33] <Uhkis> clearly you guys havent heard of cygwin if that bash on windows is a thing for you
[15:23:45] <arc_> so i guess it was already on here, just not enabled
[15:23:46] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis this is a little different than cygwin.
[15:23:53] <arc_> it's a lot different than cygwin
[15:23:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:24:18] <arc_> tools don't have to be ported to windows, you just use the linux versions
[15:24:27] <arc_> everything works exactly as it does on linux
[15:28:51] <arc_> ah ok, now it's downloading
[15:29:37] <Uhkis> arc_: have you ever ran disk cleanup?
[15:29:48] <arc_> Uhkis i'm a gamer, i have a lot of steam games installed on c:
[15:29:55] <arc_> including doom which is like 60gb by itself
[15:30:03] <Uhkis> ah
[15:30:41] <Uhkis> i have another ssd for games, because of that
[15:30:55] <arc_> i have 3 ssds and no hdds in my pc :p
[15:31:23] <taplar_> my primary is an ssd with whatever game i'm currently playing on it, and my secondary is a hdd with all my other crap
[15:32:00] <Uhkis> 3 ssds and a hdd here
[15:32:09] <robertmaxrees> i remember playing games :(
[15:32:15] <arc_> :(
[15:32:38] <arc_> there's a good casual hardcore game on humble bundle for $1 right now. it's called tharsis
[15:32:41] <Uhkis> me too, less than a week ago!
[15:32:48] <taplar_> you play guitar.  that's better than games
[15:32:48] <robertmaxrees> i will vicariously live on through you folks.
[15:33:20] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[15:33:23] <arc_> i never thought i would type ls and get "ZuneNetProxy.dll" as one of the results
[15:33:38] <robertmaxrees> sometimes i just want to veg out.
[15:33:49] <Uhkis> arc_: clearly you havent tried to play on linux :)
[15:34:09] <arc_> not sure what you mean
[15:34:30] <taplar_> Uhkis: do you like it better than just straight wine?
[15:34:54] <Uhkis> arc_: well output similar to that wouldn't be anything weird when playing with wine
[15:35:02] <arc_> oh, playonlinux
[15:35:14] <arc_> yeah idk i run windows so i don't really need to try to play games on linux
[15:35:19] <Uhkis> pol is just a gui
[15:36:08] <taplar_> i thought it also came with some preconfigured settings for popular games though
[15:36:30] <Uhkis> taplar_: have you ever tried to play guitar for hours at a time? playing games like that is way easier :D
[15:36:48] <arc_> hm, i'm not a fan of the default colors for bash
[15:37:05] <taplar_> hours at a time, no.
[15:37:09] <taplar_> minutes, yes
[15:37:25] <taplar_> my hand hates the G note
[15:37:41] <Uhkis> try G7 :D
[15:37:44] <shoky> try your other hand
[15:37:54] <taplar_> or which ever one it is that the thumb comes over the top
[15:37:57] <shoky> that's not a note :S
[15:38:00] <Uhkis> wait, G7 is a chord, G is a note
[15:38:47] <Uhkis> that thumb thing is just a playing style thing
[15:39:26] <shoky> yah i sure don't thumb any G chords ;p
[15:39:45] * taplar_ doesn't judge
[15:39:45] <Uhkis> i think taplar_ means F though
[15:39:51] <Uhkis> (or any bar chords)
[15:40:21] <shoky> mayhaps
[15:41:24] <robertmaxrees> *barre
[15:41:32] <taplar_> maybe i should try it on a ukulele and see if my baby hands do better with that
[15:42:03] <taplar_> would be less fun to destroy though in my frustration
[15:42:17] <robertmaxrees> or get a classical/flamenco guitar.
[15:42:28] <robertmaxrees> nylon strings are easier to play.
[15:43:05] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: music terms in different languages, sigh. i bet you dont know what H is :D
[15:43:37] <robertmaxrees> depends on where you are in the world.
[15:43:45] <robertmaxrees> but I know how play a B like everybody else ;)
[15:44:05] <shoky> double bar yeah???
[15:44:10] <Uhkis> :)
[15:44:38] <hariom> If timeout error occurs in a function due to upstream server not responding timely then what is the type of this error? As per javascript error types: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error
[15:45:03] <Uhkis> i recall from the early days when checking out some english tabs/chords "WTF IS B"
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis but the formal technique is definitely called "barre" which is the french term for... bar.
[15:45:37] <robertmaxrees> hairom it's a timeout.
[15:45:47] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: we call it barre too, but i've mostly seen "bar chords" in english
[15:46:00] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis yeah because most of us are lazy and spell it wrong.
[15:46:21] <robertmaxrees> hariom are you doing some ajax?
[15:47:43] <hariom> robertmaxrees: yea, but also want to know in general how should these http errors be classified according to standard error types
[15:48:02] <robertmaxrees> hariom you should be using the ajax error handlers for this instead.
[15:48:49] <hariom> robertmaxrees: I am not worried about how to handle the error. I am looking at what to call this type of errors from the available types of error. how should this be classified?
[15:49:00] <taplar_> i'm confused
[15:49:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused, too.
[15:49:39] <taplar_> it's not an Error, afaik
[15:49:43] <Uhkis> also seems more like a ##javascript problem
[15:49:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:49:49] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:50:57] <Uhkis> kudos for using mdn as a reference though! :)
[15:54:26] <taplar_> alright, back to talking about G strings and handling a B
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> man i don't have band practice tonight but i hella wish i did.
[16:17:45] <Forbidd3n> I have dynamic data loading via ajax. The parent height doesn't expand to the content. How would I set it that the dynamic data will stretch the div to the desired height
[16:18:18] <taplar_> it should stretch so long as you are not confining it
[16:20:21] <Forbidd3n> The height is being confined to they are all the same height, and they are until the data loads
[16:20:54] <taplar_> so your setting a height or a max-height ?  (this is more of a ##css question)
[16:20:55] <robertmaxrees> so you want dynamic heights once the data loads?
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> or a min-height ;)
[16:21:02] <taplar_> ^
[16:21:05] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: correct
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> use a min-height.
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> remove everything else.
[16:21:17] <robertmaxrees> taht should give you what you want.
[16:21:57] <Forbidd3n> but the height is calculated on load with visual composer vc data element being loaded in via ajax
[16:22:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:07] <Forbidd3n> I guess I need to see fi there is an action after visual composer loads data via ajax so I can get the height of the largest column and set the rest to that size
[16:23:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaah this is a wordpress thing.
[16:23:32] <robertmaxrees> i might check in a wordpress channel.
[16:23:49] <taplar_> you could select all of them and reduce, if you have to go non-wp route
[16:23:53] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: not really wordpress. They data is loaded via wordpress but the issue isnt' wordpress
[16:24:22] <robertmaxrees> but the plugin is build for wordpress, non?
[16:24:25] <Forbidd3n> taplar_: yes, but I have to find a way to set a listener to see when the item is loaded via ajax and then get the height
[16:24:27] <Forbidd3n> is that possible
[16:24:41] <robertmaxrees> just trying to point you in the direction that'll get you help the fastest.
[16:25:14] <taplar_> idk, depends if you have access to that ajax call's promise in any way
[16:25:25] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I understand. My question really is if there is a way to create a listener to check for an element with specific id or class and then trigger a method
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> you can use mutationobservers but those can be really janky.  if the plugin is using jquery's ajax stuff under the hood, then you could use a global ajax event listener.
[16:26:43] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: can you point me in the direction for a global ajax listener concept?
[16:27:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[16:27:11] <robertmaxrees> should be the first result when you google jquery global ajax events :)
[16:28:47] <Forbidd3n> oh, those have to be on the actual ajax call
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:29:20] <robertmaxrees> you can call those on the document.
[16:29:21] <Forbidd3n> so when all ajax methods are complete?
[16:29:26] <robertmaxrees> not all.
[16:29:27] <robertmaxrees> just when any.
[16:29:39] <robertmaxrees> if you need to know when ALL are complete, you've got a whole different world of pain.
[16:30:01] <Forbidd3n> so it is a loop that runs on all ajax completed actions
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> not a loop.
[16:30:22] <Forbidd3n> ok wrong terminology
[16:30:32] <Forbidd3n> every ajax that is completed it will run my method
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> they're event handlers that trigger whenever an ajax event meets particular criteria.
[16:30:51] <robertmaxrees> completed or errored or whatever, yeah.
[16:30:53] <Forbidd3n> I understand I think - I can use the second example I beleive
[16:30:57] <Forbidd3n> believe
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> $( document ).ajaxComplete(function() {});
[16:31:20] <robertmaxrees> that'll run for each ajax request that completes.
[16:31:58] <robertmaxrees> assuming some specifics about the implementation.
[17:11:33] <archer121> Hi, I have a small python script which is sending a json object when anybody visits localhost:5000. How do I get this information from jquery using ajax?
[17:11:58] <archer121> (on the browser running on localhost)
[17:12:10] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax({ url: 'http://localhost:5000' }).then(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[17:13:28] <archer121> robertmaxrees: and I get this in red: Uncaught TypeError: $.ajax is not a function(…)
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> have you loaded jquery?
[17:13:59] <archer121> robertmaxrees: I get my mistake, no I have not
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:16:51] <archer121> robertmaxrees: Please help me through this, I am not a expert in this.
[17:17:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you need help with then?
[17:17:08] <archer121> So now I this: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:5000/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' is therefore not allowed access.
[17:17:23] <archer121> I am  very nerw to all this, you see.
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> oh, because you need to use the same port, protocol, and domain for each side of things.
[17:17:43] <robertmaxrees> so if you're serving up the endpoint at localhost, you should also hit your page through localhost.
[17:18:32] <archer121> great, I've got it now.
[17:18:58] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[17:22:05] <archer121> robertmaxrees: Is it normal for the JSON object that I recieved to look very strange?
[17:22:34] <robertmaxrees> what does it look like?
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> maybe post it in a fiddle or something?
[17:22:57] <archer121> wait a second
[17:26:38] <archer121> here is a screenshot showing what things look like: http://imgur.com/a/G9CJ9
[17:26:44] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:26:53] <robertmaxrees> so that's not the actual data coming back.
[17:27:25] <robertmaxrees> that's evaluating and printing the return of $.ajax().then().  see that second object?
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> the one where it says Object {books: Array[2], patron: "nava"} ?
[17:28:05] <archer121> yeah... how do I get it in a variable?
[17:28:22] <robertmaxrees> it's in the then.
[17:28:32] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on that data needs to happen in the then
[17:28:39] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: ok so the ajaxcomplete is working great. What if a script is being included in the code that is loading from a remote source that is loading ajax?
[17:28:43] <Forbidd3n> any way to check that?
[17:28:54] <Forbidd3n> it doesn't show up in console
[17:28:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> "What if a script is being included in the code that is loading from a remote source that is loading ajax?"
[17:29:07] <robertmaxrees> example?
[17:30:24] <Forbidd3n> In the code is a <script src="anotherdomain.com/script.js"></script> and in their code they are running an ajax call to load data on the local page. Anyway to check if there data is loaded?
[17:30:43] <archer121> I don't understand what you mean by ''it's in the then."
[17:31:06] <robertmaxrees> archer121 see the part where you have .then(function(data) { console.log(data) }):
[17:31:33] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n are they using jquery to load that other ajax content?  if so, are they using the same instance you are?
[17:31:50] <Forbidd3n> they are doing it all in the include js script
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n >.> that doesn't answer ym question.
[17:32:15] <Forbidd3n> oh let me check
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:32:54] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: yep - $.ajax({
[17:33:10] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n and is it the same instance?  or are they doing something weird with, like, a noconflict call?
[17:33:11] <Forbidd3n> but the ajax call isn't in firebug
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> then the ajax call isn't firing (shrug)
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> if firebug doesn't show a network request happening, it likely isn't happening.
[17:33:43] <Forbidd3n> here is the script that the file being included - https://widgets.healcode.com/javascripts/healcode.js
[17:34:04] <Forbidd3n> it must be happening because data is loading in the div from the script
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> but you're not seeing a network request fire?
[17:34:37] <Forbidd3n> not in console from that url
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> are you watching xhr requests
[17:35:17] <Forbidd3n> let me look again to make sure
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> because that $.ajax call is not a traditional xhr call.
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> and because of the way it's configured, it'll never fire a global ajax event handler.
[17:36:22] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/ -> "ote: Global events are never fired for cross-domain script or JSONP requests, regardless of the value of global."  the script you linked has dataType: 'jsonp',
[17:37:21] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: not showing in network -> xhr
[17:37:35] <robertmaxrees> reread the last few things i said :)
[17:39:25] <Forbidd3n> so any way to check when that script data is loaded on the page with a listener?
[17:39:37] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:47:56] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: so in short, there really is no way to force the height of containers after all the content has loaded within them
[17:48:08] <robertmaxrees> sure there is.
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> if you have control over the callbacks or they're using actual ajax.
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> neither of those are true in this case.
[17:48:33] <taplar_> crazy thought
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> there's the subtreemodified stuff, but that's pretty nutty.
[17:48:40] <taplar_> could you use display: table-cell?
[17:48:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd still look at a css based solution though.
[17:49:42] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: with css I would have to set a min-height on each element statically
[17:50:15] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you need to statically set anything.  but i don't have your code in front of me soooo
[17:56:21] <gambl0re> hi robert
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> me?
[17:57:06] <gambl0re> hows going?
[17:57:11] <taplar_> well that sux... https://jsfiddle.net/5ssynnem/
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> going alright i suppose gambl0re.  you?
[17:58:15] <gambl0re> i havent talked to you in a long time..
[17:58:35] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:58:36] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/5ssynnem/1/ so it works as long as you don't interfere with it
[17:58:53] <robertmaxrees> iiiinteresting taplar_
[17:58:53] <gambl0re> are you working on any cool projects at work?
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> working on lots of different things right now.
[17:59:48] <gambl0re> cool
[18:01:47] <robertmaxrees> sure
[18:11:49] <taplar> kinda funny, earlier when you said 'vs code' i took that as 'verses'
[18:12:00] <taplar> versus?
[18:18:44] <archer121> robertmaxrees: I've made it so far thanks to you. I am almost ready with my code. I just need your advice on how to deal with "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present..."
[18:19:10] <robertmaxrees> put the API and the page under the same URL.
[18:20:16] <archer121> and the same port too? is that necessary?
[18:20:22] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain, yeah.
[18:21:05] <archer121> do you need it to be the same url? will it be fine with just the same port,protocol,domain?
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> just those three.
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> rest can be different.
[18:24:20] <archer121> robertmaxrees: So I just need apache to host my python backend program. Thanks a lot, i need to catch some sleep!
[18:24:27] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  enjoy.
[18:24:57] <archer121> you really made life a lot easier for me today.
[18:25:13] <robertmaxrees> glad i could help :)
[18:28:38] <momo> Hello, I am new to jquery UI, I am trying to use Tabs, I had a problem and it's about why this scrolling when clicking on the tab
[18:29:03] <momo> http://recventure.io/consulting-services/ the url
[18:29:21] <robertmaxrees> momo do youy happen to have an isolated test case?
[18:29:42] <momo> Da in the isolated test everything is going out of the box
[18:30:21] <momo> i kind of feel that there is a conflict somewhere in the wordpress theme
[18:30:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:30:39] <robertmaxrees> MK.utils.scrollToAnchor(anchor);
[18:30:46] <robertmaxrees> that's getting called.
[18:30:55] <taplar> there is also a console error on load
[18:31:31] <momo> i did not see any console error
[18:31:51] <taplar> "TypeError: this.ajaxForm is not a function"
[18:32:48] <momo> Oh, I am using chrome and unfortunately i can not see this error, okie i will check it
[18:33:09] <momo> so the thing now about the scrolling is to search for this fun in the assets ?
[18:33:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to modify the assets directly though.
[18:34:12] <momo> so what should i do ?
[18:34:29] <robertmaxrees> look through the docs for the theme and see if there are any options.
[18:34:37] <robertmaxrees> if not, look into programmatically using jqui.
[18:36:38] <momo> okie i will do that, and about the programmatically way is to create a function by myself ?
[18:36:44] <momo> or what do you mean ?
[18:36:48] <robertmaxrees> manually wiring it yourself.
[18:37:19] <momo> Da, Okie thanks I will try to work it out :)
[18:40:32] <robertmaxrees> momo i might start fixing you pageload times and stuff.
[18:42:32] <momo> How ?
[18:44:47] <robertmaxrees> well the page is almost 4 megs.
[18:44:52] <robertmaxrees> and takes over 12 seconds to load.
[18:44:58] <robertmaxrees> do you actually need everything you're loading in?
[18:45:17] <robertmaxrees> looks like over 1.5 megs of just JS.
[18:45:34] <robertmaxrees> might also look into minifying/gzipping as much as possible.
[18:46:08] <momo> So I have to get rid of the not used scripts ?
[18:46:18] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[18:46:26] <taplar> it also doesn't look like it's caching
[18:46:28] <robertmaxrees> if you're not going to use them, why load them?
[18:46:51] <taplar> refreshing i'm still getting 200s instead of any 301s
[18:46:57] <robertmaxrees> eep
[18:47:10] <momo> Da of course
[18:47:36] <momo> I am using cache tools to reduce the size of http
[18:47:41] <robertmaxrees> moei
[18:47:47] <momo> any advice so ?
[18:47:50] <robertmaxrees> momo wrong side of cache to worry about.
[18:48:00] <robertmaxrees> your server should let users cache things on their.
[18:48:04] <robertmaxrees> *on their end, rather
[18:49:24] <taplar> your also loading a few images.  some of them, potentially, could be loaded as a sprite map (is that the right term?)
[18:49:51] <momo> so modifying .httpaccess ? will fix caches issues
[18:50:10] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean htaccess
[18:50:23] <momo> yes
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> check out cache control
[18:51:42] <momo> but this sprite map for imgs that work like icons ?
[18:51:44] <momo> right ?
[18:51:53] <taplar> ya
[18:51:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:52:45] <momo> so using this by loading it for one time and controlling the width and height each time i use it for an img
[18:52:50] <momo> is that right way to do so?
[18:52:57] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[18:53:05] <robertmaxrees> lots of reading material out there on the subject.
[18:53:22] <momo> Okie, thanks I will go through this
[18:54:17] <momo> I found that i have MK.utils.scrollToAnchor() in the theme script.js
[18:54:51] <robertmaxrees> right. you don't want to modify the theme directly.  i'd check to see if there's a way to configure that behavior.
[18:55:31] <momo> I toggled through all the options and i could not find any related action to this function
[18:55:47] <robertmaxrees> then you'll want to manually wire up those tabs.
[18:56:43] <momo> but how i will avoid this noisy function ?
[18:56:57] <momo> i mean to avoid it in my code
[18:57:10] <robertmaxrees> if you read the code around it, you'll see there's probably a thing that check if the href="#" or something.
[18:57:44] <momo> Da, the  '#top-of-page'
[18:57:57] <robertmaxrees> right, so if you set the hrefs to just #, that should fix it.
[18:58:02] <robertmaxrees> but you'll have to fix how the tabs work.
[19:01:15] <momo> Ok, and back to the size of the loading page
[19:01:54] <momo> should i deque the not used libraries
[19:02:04] <robertmaxrees> are you loading libraries you're not using?
[19:02:11] * taplar lives again!!!
[19:02:31] <robertmaxrees> woooo!
[19:02:38] <taplar> i tried to run ff performance on the page
[19:02:40] <taplar> it froze
[19:02:44] <robertmaxrees> eep.
[19:02:48] <taplar> lol
[19:03:06] <momo> lol
[19:13:31] <adamsilver> How do I select all forms except the ones with no-ajax: <form no-ajax action="..."...>
[19:13:48] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver any way you could use data attributes for that instead?
[19:13:55] <taplar> $('form').not('.no-ajax')
[19:14:03] <taplar> wait
[19:14:07] <taplar> that's a tag.
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's nopt a class ;)
[19:14:17] <taplar> you don't want to make custom attributes like that
[19:14:19] <robertmaxrees> AdamPDotty or use a class, hell.
[19:14:23] <taplar> ^
[19:14:23] <robertmaxrees> err, adamsilver
[19:15:10] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: how can I add it here: $(document).on('submit', 'form', function (e) {
[19:15:29] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver any reason you can't use a class or data attribute instead?
[19:16:06] <taplar> $(document).on('submit', 'form:not(.no-ajax)', function (e) {
[19:16:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:16:17] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: too many forms and I only want to exclude one
[19:16:33] <taplar> a class is still preferred
[19:16:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then give it a particular class.
[19:17:29] <adamsilver> I don't really understand
[19:17:43] <robertmaxrees> give it a no-ajax class and then use what taplar showed you.
[19:18:12] <taplar> classes/ids are stored by the browser in such a way that they are super fast to lookup
[19:18:21] <robertmaxrees> and custom attributes are a general no-no.
[19:18:21] <taplar> other things, such as attributes, not
[19:18:43] <adamsilver> I don't get how I can add it to: $(document).on('submit', 'form', function (e) {
[19:18:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:18:50] <robertmaxrees> taplar showed you.
[19:18:56] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('submit', 'form:not(.no-ajax)', function (e) {
[19:19:07] <adamsilver> oh, I see it now.
[19:19:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:19:13] <adamsilver> Sorry, let me try :)
[19:21:18] <adamsilver> Cool, thanks. This works: $(document).on('submit', 'form:not([no-ajax])', function (e) { ... <form no-ajax...
[19:21:31] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:21:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:21:37] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[19:21:38] <taplar> cool
[19:21:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd still make that a class if possible to not break things, but meh.
[19:23:13] <adamsilver> I understand you're saying a class is better but I like to use classes only to alter something visually as much as I can :)
[19:23:33] <robertmaxrees> you know that custom attributes aren't very well supported, yeah?
[19:23:45] <robertmaxrees> like, they can be inconsistent?
[19:23:52] <taplar> and classes are just classes, not CSS classes
[19:23:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:24:32] <robertmaxrees> if you want custom attributes for strictly non-display purposes, use data attributes.  in fact, that's apart of their spec.
[19:25:34] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: I think jQ takes care of the compatibility
[19:27:55] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver not necessarily.
[19:27:58] <robertmaxrees> but meh, your call.
[19:55:17] <z1haze> if a new view is loaded with ajax, will the scripts from that load be initialized or does something need to be done specifically for that
[19:56:00] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you load it.
[19:56:08] <robertmaxrees> though i'd avoid doing it like that at all.
[19:56:40] <taplar> what kind of scripts are you asking about?  like bindings or like other initializations?
[19:57:14] <taplar> or are you saying that ajax load of the view is pulling in js too
[19:58:02] <printForever> is it possible to redirect all visitors to a single page via jQuery?
[19:58:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:58:13] <printForever> all visitors from mobile (phone and tablet)
[19:58:14] <robertmaxrees> gotta use native js for that.
[19:58:26] <robertmaxrees> though I'd go with the server-level for that.
[19:58:28] <printForever> shucks
[19:58:39] <printForever> there is no good approach
[19:58:45] <robertmaxrees> sure there is.
[19:58:57] <printForever> ok, I'm game
[19:58:58] <robertmaxrees> we sniff user agents and direct you as appropriate.
[19:58:59] <printForever> what is it?
[19:59:05] <printForever> you can fake user agents
[19:59:09] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:59:12] <robertmaxrees> if they do that, fine.
[19:59:14] <robertmaxrees> let 'em.
[19:59:26] <robertmaxrees> any user spoofing a user agent is asking for funk.
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> and there's no other way to tell what device they're really on anyway.
[20:00:16] <robertmaxrees> screen size is kind of a silly metric because some tablets have higher res than some laptops.
[20:00:22] <printForever> well you can test for viewport size
[20:00:31] <printForever> with dpi test
[20:00:31] <robertmaxrees> see previous statement :)
[20:00:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not reliable.
[20:00:38] <printForever> yeah yeah
[20:00:43] <robertmaxrees> stick with the user agent.
[20:00:46] <printForever> well... there is no 100% solution
[20:00:47] <printForever> ok
[20:00:48] <printForever> will do
[20:00:51] <printForever> htaccess
[20:00:55] <robertmaxrees> users spoofing are none of your concern.
[20:01:00] <robertmaxrees> we use our f5 for that i think.
[20:31:36] <printForever> thanks robertmaxrees
[21:11:46] <YokoBR> hi guys
[21:11:50] <YokoBR> and gals
[21:12:15] <YokoBR> well, i'm appending html data into a div, but i can't scroll it
[21:13:05] <YokoBR> I've already tryied "overflow:auto", "overflow:scroll", but it's stuck. I thought it was caused by freewalljs but it's not :I
[21:16:27] <shoky> divs height wraps the content by default, you'll only get a scrollbar if there's actually overflow, e.g. if the div has a fixed height
[21:49:02] <YokoBR> tryied iscroll, but still stuck
[21:49:13] <YokoBR> why, god. why
[22:18:46] <YokoBR> hi folks
[22:19:44] <YokoBR> please, I really need help on this. I'm making an ajax call, and for each object i'm building the content, then appending it. But i can't scroll down.
