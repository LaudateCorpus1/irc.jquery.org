[00:44:15] <lalle> is it "legal" to refresh a page through ajax, every one sec?
[00:45:02] <Whirl3d_> lalle. Why would you want to do that?
[00:45:31] <lalle> to "keep an eye" on a div tag+
[00:45:46] <Whirl3d_> for what?
[00:45:58] <Back2Basics> lalle: you want to listen to callbacks.
[00:46:07] <lalle> maybe i have found another way..
[00:46:49] <Whirl3d_> Still unclear what you are trying to do. I figure there's a much better way to handle and like Back2Basics indicated it most likely will either involve callbacks or deferreds
[00:48:46] <lalle> no i dident..
[00:49:31] <lalle> ehm, the thing is that i'am echoing a session array in a div, in a table. iam using ajax to add things to this session array, but when i do that, it ofc dosent update the session echo. thats what i want
[00:51:08] <lalle> any suggestions?
[00:51:17] <Whirl3d_> sorry, I'm not familiar with session arrays. It sound like a job for PHP to me.
[00:52:17] <lalle> it is not the echo part, it is the update part. it cant be right that i have to update the whole page.
[00:54:01] <Whirl3d_> I don't even know what yo mean by update the session array?
[00:54:58] <lalle> adding stuff to it. and then i echo the session in a foreach, but, when i have added a new item to the session, it ofc dosent update and then show it on page.
[00:57:19] <Whirl3d_> because I gues you didn't hear me the first two times: I don't know what a session array is or how one adds to it or access it or what the funk  you are talking about, so I'll look it up and get back to you.
[00:58:22] <Vodric> session is accessed by PHP
[00:58:59] <lalle> yes ?
[00:59:13] <Vodric> yes its the $_SESSION[] array
[00:59:24] <Vodric> But that belongs in #php :)
[00:59:37] <Whirl3d_> lalle, I think what you want to do is going to best be handled by webworkers or serverside.
[01:01:01] <lalle> but.. i was having a thouth that i could have an external php page where i echo my stuff, and then put that entire page in a div on the other page, and then update it after every "action" ?
[01:01:27] <Vodric> you would have to use ajax but yes it can be done
[01:02:01] <lalle> thats exaxly what i want :)
[01:02:08] <Vodric> :)
[01:02:19] <Whirl3d_> but an ajax call every 1 second.....wow
[01:02:41] <lalle> it is not nessary to make it every 1 sec, if i just can call it like a function..
[01:03:26] <Whirl3d_> okay, that's different than what you originally asked: <lalle> is it "legal" to refresh a page through ajax, every one sec?
[01:03:56] <lalle> Whirl3d_: yes it is :) i just figured out that it wasent nessary that way..
[01:05:40] <lalle> but.. i cant seem to get it work :s
[01:18:25] <superJ> ¦ i need to do some website, what web language you recomend?
[01:18:42] <ravenzz> flash
[01:18:48] <yotam> :D
[01:19:02] <tw2113> cobol
[01:19:33] <superJ> jajaja
[01:19:41] <superJ> java with jsp? for many users
[01:20:05] <superJ> mmmmm site is e-commerce
[01:20:21] <superJ> but, for all public no something little
[01:20:23] <tw2113> html/css/javascript when needed, whatever your e-commerce solution is coded in
[01:21:03] <superJ> yess, html/css/javascript is good. but php or java?
[01:21:17] <yotam> php
[01:21:18] <superJ> better php or jsp?
[01:21:23] <ravenzz> ruby is trending
[01:21:26] <lalle> asp .... ?
[01:21:27] <superJ> why php and no jsp?
[01:21:39] <superJ> noo asp not, only free
[01:21:48] <lalle> then PHP
[01:22:18] <ravenzz> you could try this http://getplatform.com/
[01:22:23] <superJ> but debuger servers web is a problem with php
[01:23:16] <ravenzz> and this http://www.cartalyst.com which looks promising
[01:25:12] <superJ> Oki the site is very good, but i don´t looking a armed solution

[01:40:34] <ProLoser|Work> helo
[01:40:37] <ProLoser|Work> anyone around?
[01:46:32] <Whirl3d_> what's up?
[01:51:10] <ProLoser|Work> when you do $.ajax() to post data, if i pass a json object is there a way to convert it to the more conventional POST format?
[01:51:14] <ProLoser|Work> like by setting some option?
[01:51:23] <ProLoser|Work> or am i forced to do it manually
[01:51:52] <Whirl3d_> You mean you want to deparameterize the JSON data
[01:52:37] <Whirl3d_> so you get a single long string like: ?variablename=something&&something=other&&...etc
[01:58:26] <ProLoser|Work> i guess
[01:58:35] <ProLoser|Work> is that how post data is normally submitted when you submit a form?
[01:58:59] <Whirl3d_> check out the ben allman plugin for deparams...maybe it would have what you are looking for...
[01:59:18] <ProLoser|Work> so why isn't this like a native thing?
[01:59:55] <sanova> hi
[02:00:20] <Whirl3d_> Gotta draw the line somewhere.
[02:00:36] <Whirl3d_> You could always populate a bunch of inputs and use serialize
[02:00:42] <tocka> s
[02:01:25] <Whirl3d_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10335135/to-post-value-of-get-by-using-jquery
[02:02:29] <Whirl3d_> bascically, it takes the JSON object returned from a callback and submits it using POST via AJAx.
[02:02:44] <Whirl3d_> the method is called STRINGIFY
[02:02:58] <Whirl3d_> ? .stringify
[02:03:07] <Whirl3d_> bot-t is on vaca still. LOL
[02:04:27] <Whirl3d_> but here's a better use of it: https://gist.github.com/754454/
[02:09:33] <sanova> i have some issues with selector for a filter like this: $('div#foo:not([class*="' + valueSearch + '"])').hide(); $('div#foo[class*="' + valueSearch + '"]').show(); where valueSearch is: $('#foo_Search').val().toUpperCase();
[02:10:48] <ravenzz> ?demo @ sanova
[02:11:05] <ravenzz> what kind of issues
[02:11:24] <sanova> if #foo_Search value is a "b" filter doesn't work.
[02:11:38] <ravenzz> what is a b filter?
[02:11:38] <Whirl3d_> first of all, you don't need div#foo   because #foo is a single instance and there's no need to first grab all the divs then grab the #foo....just grab the #foo
[02:11:53] <tintin> Anyone there ?
[02:12:13] <sanova> Whirl3d_: yes you are right
[02:12:24] <Back2Basics> tintin: no
[02:12:55] <Whirl3d_> then, so select by class, try $("."+$("#foo_search").val().toUpperCase())
[02:13:38] <tintin> Back2Basics: Oh, you here too?
[02:13:39] <sanova> i can try..
[02:13:48] <Whirl3d_> $("."+classvalue)   I think is a lot faster than $("[class*='"+classvalue+"']");
[02:14:31] <Whirl3d_> and maybe to start, make your script obnoxiously verbose so you can troubleshoot it. Then, pare it down to one long chained stateemnt...
[02:15:51] <Whirl3d_> var searchValue=$("#foo_search").val().toUpperCase;   var foodiv=$("#foot"); if(foodiv.is("."+searchValue) { foodiv.hide();} else {foodiv.show()};
[02:16:02] <Whirl3d_> *toUpperCase()
[02:16:20] <Whirl3d_> all kinds o crazy typos in that, but you get the idea. LOL
[02:16:20] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3027635 , this doesn't send the ajax request, why?
[02:16:31] <sanova> yes, thanks
[02:16:38] <tintin> I don't get the response from firefox console
[02:17:01] <tintin> The ajax request is not loading in firebug-console, why?
[02:17:11] <tintin> What's wrong with it? https://gist.github.com/3027635
[02:17:22] <Whirl3d_> probably because you are composing your data wrong.
[02:17:45] <Whirl3d_> add an error handler to your ajax call to see what comes back.
[02:17:50] <tintin> No
[02:18:13] <tintin> How can i add error handler to ajax call?
[02:18:33] <Whirl3d_> underneat success: function () {}
[02:18:54] <Whirl3d_> add "   error:funciton () {console.log(arguments);}
[02:19:27] <Whirl3d_> except spell function right and make sure to put a comma after the end of the success:function () {},
[02:20:43] <tintin> I can see the request/post sent from firebug
[02:21:29] <Whirl3d_> and....
[02:21:54] <tintin> But the response is not right
[02:22:08] <Whirl3d_> sounds like a problem with your server then
[02:22:13] <tintin> The response is exactly the same form page i clicked on
[02:23:27] <tintin> I got csrf problem
[02:23:48] <Whirl3d_> csrf?
[02:23:48] <tintin> This is the problem, https://gist.github.com/3027666
[02:24:33] <Whirl3d_> that means you are not encoding your post correctly.
[02:25:07] <tintin> What do you mean by encoding?
[02:26:14] <newbiee> http://jsfiddle.net/CzqFL/
[02:26:22] <newbiee> where is the speed controlled in this jquery function
[02:26:33] <newbiee> i tried to implement it and it is running too fast
[02:26:35] <Whirl3d_> you are sending an object literal or something weird...it wants to see stuff like ?crsftoken=39343j4ngksdu98334&&data=something&&
[02:26:51] <Whirl3d_> but you are not sending that
[02:28:57] <Mar2u> hello
[02:28:59] <tintin> Whirl3d_: This is how i'm sending data, data: { query: qry, csrfmiddlewaretoken: csrftoken },
[02:29:15] <tintin> Whirl3d_: This is from firebug, csrfmiddlewaretoken=MNi7yFKdw9OWiHB7XpxbbQ7qwuBx8F0T&query=obama&submit=Submit
[02:29:58] <Whirl3d_> now lookup how your server wants to receive the data...
[02:30:08] <sanova> now it doesn't work typing all characters in the filter field.. maybe it depends on first selector: I have to selct by class like this: $('.foo').is("." + searchValue) and not by id. Can it be wrong?
[02:31:24] <Whirl3d_> sanova, you are going to have to paste some working (or close to working) code at jsfiddle. That's the only way at this point. Make sure to paste your HTML, JS, and CSS in the approrpriate fields, select JQUERY from the menu on the left and save. Then share the url back here for help.
[02:31:47] <Mar2u> if someone can help me please: can  I fire an event when a iframe has finished loading?
[02:32:09] <sanova> Whirl3d_: ok :)
[02:32:55] <Whirl3d_> newbie, change the duration= formula so that /.025 is a different number....one will speed it up one will slow it down. Not sure which tias...
[02:33:25] <Whirl3d_> newbiew, make it smaller....like .0025
[02:33:44] <Whirl3d_> that's way too slow...
[02:34:20] <newbiee> what to change in the formula
[02:34:28] <newbiee> i could not see any numbers or fixed integers
[02:34:37] <tintin> Whirl3d_: I get this error from server, https://gist.github.com/3027689
[02:36:49] <Whirl3d_> newbie, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CzqFL/39/
[02:37:02] <tintin> Did you see error?
[02:38:30] <Whirl3d_> tintin, you are mighty pushy....listen that might be complaining because you are not sending it a request from a normal url. You are debugging locally and it might not get 127.0.0.1   is a valid or acceptible url to receive an ajax request from.
[02:38:52] <Whirl3d_> this is clearly not a jquery issue, though. This has to do with your server. Contact the server admin and ask him what's up.
[02:40:14] <Whirl3d_> or maybe someon in #python could help.
[02:41:06] <Bennit> http://pastebin.com/Ye8aZryk # anyone an idea why my response seems to make it twice in the dom tree?
[02:41:27] <Whirl3d_> Mar2u, I am not sure. but I'll Google it for ya if ya want....
[02:41:46] <Mar2u> thanks
[02:41:52] <Mar2u> i us them
[02:42:00] <Mar2u> <script language="javascript">
[02:42:01] <Mar2u>     iframe = document.getElementById("frameid");
[02:42:03] <Mar2u>     WaitForIFrame();
[02:42:05] <Mar2u>     function WaitForIFrame() {
[02:42:06] <Mar2u>         if (iframe.readyState != "complete") {
[02:42:08] <Mar2u>             setTimeout("WaitForIFrame();", 200);
[02:42:09] <Mar2u>         } else {
[02:42:10] <Mar2u>             done();
[02:42:12] <Mar2u>         }
[02:42:14] <Mar2u>     }
[02:42:14] <Whirl3d_> no no no non
[02:42:15] <Mar2u>     function done() {
[02:42:17] <Mar2u>         //some code after iframe has been loaded
[02:42:17] <Whirl3d_> stop
[02:42:18] <Mar2u>     }
[02:42:20] <Mar2u> </script>
[02:42:33] <Whirl3d_> use jsfiddle to post your code. don't post in the channel
[02:42:41] <Mar2u> ok sory
[02:42:45] <Whirl3d_> np
[02:42:52] <Mar2u> why?
[02:43:19] <Mar2u> whats happen with code on chanel
[02:43:21] <Mar2u> ?
[02:43:32] <Whirl3d_> well for one thing, my computer makes a loud beep every time someone posts and It's 5:40 a.m. here . It pisses me off and my roomates
[02:43:35] <Mar2u> trafic?
[02:43:37] <Whirl3d_> for starters
[02:43:47] <lwm> haaa, its just cleaner for everyone
[02:44:00] <Whirl3d_> and then it's hard to look through a mash of text like that and decipher anything
[02:44:16] <Mar2u> ok thanks
[02:44:18] <Whirl3d_> jsfiddle is a great sandbox where you can actually try shit out.
[02:45:18] <Whirl3d_> my first or second post to this channel was about 30 lines of code. LOL I had no idea, so don't take it personally...lol
[02:45:23] <tintin> Mar2u: Why don't you use gist.github.com to paste code?
[02:45:39] <Whirl3d_> don't use gist....use jsfiddle, please.
[02:45:40] <Mar2u> :))
[02:46:07] <dagerik> done use jsfiddle, use ideone.com pls
[02:46:14] <dagerik> LOL
[02:46:21] <Mar2u> i need a account
[02:46:28] <Whirl3d_> not for fiddle
[02:46:28] <Mar2u> and that take time
[02:46:30] <Mar2u> ......
[02:46:32] <Bennit> weird thing about my dubble dom tree insert is that chrome's element explorer doesn't show it twice, however, jQuery does
[02:46:46] <lwm> jeez, just checked ideone.com , that looks messy..
[02:47:27] <tintin> Whirl3d_: But if i use event.preventDefault(); , then the ajax request works, why?
[02:47:37] <tintin> What is that even.preventDefalut();
[02:47:48] <Whirl3d_> tintin
[02:47:50] <Whirl3d_> wow
[02:48:03] <Whirl3d_> That prevents the default submit action
[02:48:10] <Whirl3d_> so you can preprocess the shit
[02:48:29] <Whirl3d_> otherwise it sends whatever it has in the form (which doesn't include the token you need)
[02:48:37] <Mar2u> that is http://jsfiddle.net/UtmJR
[02:48:39] <tintin> Is this event.preventDefault(); must?
[02:48:50] <Whirl3d_> not if you don't want it to work
[02:49:42] <tintin> Why doesn't it take/include the csrf token if i don't use event.preventDefault(); ?
[02:50:45] <Whirl3d_> where do you get the token from?
[02:51:29] <tintin> var csrftoken = $(this).find('input[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]').val(); from here
[02:51:56] <Whirl3d_> do you have any other fields?
[02:52:05] <Whirl3d_> maybe it doesn't like the submit button
[02:52:40] <tintin> That's not submit button
[02:52:59] <Whirl3d_> but in the output from firebug it showed the input=submit
[02:53:07] <Whirl3d_> is being submitted to the server.
[02:53:11] <tintin> Thas is this: <input name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="fEVrTrKYGb2HvWDrTbb7gYw1IaLsiVg6" type="hidden">
[02:53:13] <Whirl3d_> maybe it's hiccuping on that.
[02:53:51] <tintin> Whirl3d_: That csrf is a hidden field
[02:55:06] <sanova> this is my code: pastebin.com/miucX1yb  <-- hope it is clear
[02:57:03] <tintin> Whirl3d_: ??
[02:57:09] <Whirl3d_> tintin, where is the output from firebug
[02:57:22] <systemfault> oh my lulzâ¦. still on the same problem? :(
[02:58:22] <Whirl3d_> This is what we get paid the big bucks for systemfault...oh wait, we aren't getting paid...we are just doing this out of the kindness of our hearts and a deep sense of massochism I guess.
[02:59:05] <Whirl3d_> tintin, as far as I am concerned, if preventDefault solves the problem. CASE CLOSED.
[02:59:27] <tintin> Whirl3d_: What output from firebug are you looking for?
[02:59:32] <systemfault> Whirl3d_: <3
[02:59:39] <tintin> Whirl3d_: The request.POST ?
[02:59:49] <Whirl3d_> where you showed the exact post sent to your server
[03:00:07] <Whirl3d_> the one where I suggested next that you should see what the server expects to receive from you
[03:00:59] <Whirl3d_> where I contend that because the submit button is being posted as an input field with your request before you do anything else (because you aren't preventing the default), it's wigging your server out
[03:02:01] <Whirl3d_> compare the successful request.post to the unsuccessful and you will see the problem.
[03:02:38] <tintin> Whirl3d_: <QueryDict: {u'query': [u'obama'], u'csrfmiddlewaretoken': [u'36XiKEChFxiS579FEZBsC8ughPuKRRbw'], u'submit': [u'Submit']}>
[03:03:27] <Whirl3d_> Bennit, I have no idea what .mapE does or what is going on with your pastebin code. BUt it is a good example of why jsfiddle is much easier to help with...
[03:04:01] <Whirl3d_> is that the good one or the bad one? I am assuming its the bad one. S
[03:04:09] <Whirl3d_> so what does the good post look like?
[03:05:14] <Whirl3d_> Mar2u, I'm still looking in google for ya...
[03:05:46] <Mar2u> that dont work?
[03:05:53] <Bennit> Whirl3d_: it's fixed, my loadzone was div.lobby-inner, but I had a second one which I hid, and didn't think off
[03:06:02] <Bennit> so it made sense it loaded twice
[03:06:05] <Mar2u> i don't try it
[03:06:07] <newbiee> that did not work whirl
[03:06:13] <newbiee> its still going at a fast pavce
[03:06:45] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/UtmJR/1/ Mar2u
[03:07:10] <Whirl3d_> newbie, wow. Did you click the button a couple times to see it speed up
[03:07:46] <Mar2u> ok thanks
[03:09:21] <Mar2u> i dont understand the second one....
[03:09:34] <Mar2u> with calliframe
[03:10:03] <newbiee> i could not see a button
[03:11:05] <newbiee> i want it to slow down
[03:11:09] <newbiee> not speed up
[03:11:44] <Mar2u> is not ok return some garbage code ....
[03:12:42] <newbiee> also in the div there should not be a button
[03:15:17] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CzqFL/46/
[03:15:28] <Whirl3d_> newbiee, this is so you can figure out the speed
[03:15:42] <Whirl3d_> enter a number in the up field or the down field until it looks how you want it
[03:15:55] <Whirl3d_> write the fucking number down and manually replace it wher eyou see incr.
[03:16:02] <Whirl3d_> then get rid of the buttons
[03:17:08] <Mar2u> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/UtmJR/1/
[03:17:28] <Mar2u> about that why return });//]]>
[03:19:10] <tintin> How can i add a error instead of success, success: function(prm) {
[03:19:31] <tintin> This success: function(prm) is not called during jquery ajax
[03:19:41] <tintin> I want to find out the reason why?
[03:19:55] <tintin> So how can i add something reverse to success: function(prm) {
[03:21:08] <Whirl3d_> tintin, you are so fucking selfish I can't stand it. Hopefully somebody else will have another six hours to devote to your learning since you refuse to use google and your refuse to listen when someone tries to help. I am not playing that game any more. buh bye
[03:22:00] <sanova> i found out the error: it depends on class i added: b-gridBer that has "B", so selector match "B" of that class :)
[03:22:04] <systemfault> lol
[03:22:26] <tintin> Are you guys paid to help here?
[03:22:31] <systemfault> nope
[03:22:34] <systemfault> I wish.

[05:08:22] <whateverb> Hi, is it possible to slide elements with jquery so that parent elements slide with different speed as their children elements? Is there a plugin or smth?
[05:26:24] <shoky> hachoo
[05:29:41] <shahin8r> Why doesn't this code open my Lightbox: $('.mylink').trigger('click');? Clicking the link works like a charm.
[05:34:40] <shoky> shahin8r: need more info
[05:37:59] <shahin8r> Ok. I have an Wordpress site. I want the page to open an Lightbox on load. I've got a link with <a class="mylink"> and if I press the link manually my Lightbox pops up. But I want it to open automatically. I've tried to put a test alert('test'); instead and that shows up on load so the code is in the right place. :) I'm a novice at php/wordpress/jquery/css/html.
[05:38:41] <shoky> how does it open when you click the link?
[05:38:48] <shoky> you added a click handler?
[05:41:57] <shahin8r> It's a plugin called Lightbox Plus and I just configured a Inline Lightbox with a Link Class that is the exakt name as the <a class="mylink">. The plugin does the rest.
[05:43:17] <shoky> does the link have 'rel' attribute?
[05:45:28] <systemfault> shahin8r: There's probably an API section on the plugin's website.
[05:45:40] <systemfault> If notâ¦ I'd consider switching to another plugin
[05:51:20] <shahin8r> systemfault: Ok. So it's a plugin related issue? I'll check it up. Thanks.
[05:52:19] <systemfault> shahin8r: Yeah, for example.. plugins I've seen in the past have a "open" function that you can call to trigger the lightbox
[05:52:57] <systemfault> shahin8r: Another thing (a bit hackish) that you can do is programmatically trigger a click on the anchor that opens the lightbox
[06:07:17] <shahin8r> systemfault: I thought this code $('.my-link').trigger('click'); did that?
[06:07:45] <systemfault> I haven't seen your code :/
[06:08:08] <shahin8r> My link is <a class="my-link">.
[06:08:11] <shahin8r> What more do you need?
[06:08:57] <shahin8r> If I click the manually on the page the Lightbox pops up.
[06:09:15] <systemfault> It should work then.
[06:13:25] <shoky> shahin8r: you said "I just configured a Inline Lightbox with a Link Class that is the exakt name as the <a class="mylink">"
[06:13:40] <shoky> shahin8r: what do you mean by "exact name" ? i dont see any name on your link
[06:14:02] <shoky> o the class, sorry.
[06:14:08] <shoky> that's how the plugin works? eh
[06:14:56] <shoky> that's not what i saw when reading how to use it tho
[06:17:39] <shahin8r> I think it's because it's an "inline lightbox".
[06:21:17] <shahin8r> It's solved. I tried to trigger the link before it was assigned to Lightbox. Moved down the code a bit and now it worked flawlessly. Stupid me. Thanks a lot systemfault for the help!
[06:21:30] <systemfault> :)
[07:21:38] <sobczyk> hi, I'm trying to use $.ajax with django-tastypie, but when I do PUT the server complains about the data being urlencoded
[07:21:46] <sobczyk> is there a way to change it?
[07:23:21] <shoky> sobczyk: you can set the 'contentType' optio
[07:23:23] <shoky> option
[07:24:41] <samuelj> Hey guys, I'm taking part in startup weekend and have an hour til our presentation, seriously stuck on a problem with the google geocode api and getJSON
[07:24:46] <samuelj> I think it's to do with JSONP
[07:24:56] <samuelj> I'd really appreciate any help, I'll pastie now
[07:25:41] <samuelj> The error is unexpected syntax :
[07:25:42] <samuelj> http://pastebin.com/kyJTCgpw
[07:25:50] <samuelj> Thanks in advance :) :)
[07:28:16] <shoky> samuelj: you don't need  jsonp: "callback"  nor  do you need to put the &callback=?  in your url
[07:29:17] <samuelj> shoky Ok, i've tried that, same error!
[07:29:44] <samuelj> Any other ideas?
[07:29:49] <shoky> that's the whole error?
[07:29:54] <shoky> when is it thrown?
[07:30:07] <samuelj> Once for each time I call the ajax request
[07:30:14] <samuelj> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[07:30:24] <samuelj> This is the json http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=UB5+4BY&sensor=false
[07:30:25] <shoky> the $.getJSON works fine ?
[07:30:28] <shoky> the twitter one
[07:30:30] <samuelj> yes shoky
[07:31:03] <shoky> geocode api supports jsonp just by adding the callback=...  ?
[07:31:17] <samuelj> Yeah I think so
[07:32:46] <sobczyk> shoky: worked, thanks
[07:32:46] <shoky> i am reading that google removed jsonp support
[07:32:54] <shoky> donno if that's the current status though
[07:33:35] <shoky> you need to access the geocoding service with their API objects
[07:34:55] <shoky> do you have a link saying they support jsonp?
[07:37:45] <shoky> you have to either use their javascript API, or setup a proxy server to do the actual http requests
[07:40:46] <samuelj> I'm confused, so do you have to use a special lib?
[07:42:51] <shoky> yes
[07:42:54] <shoky> samuelj: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding?hl=no-NO
[07:49:42] <shoky> samuelj or maybe start here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
[08:19:09] <zim> Hi all. I am trying to alert ($(this).data().serialize()); that am I doing wron?
[08:19:31] <zim> s/that/what
[08:20:19] <zim> s/wron/wrong (note to self read before enter)
[08:22:02] <shoky> uhm
[08:22:10] <shoky> what are you trying to do
[08:22:21] <shoky> do you know what .data() returns?
[08:22:47] <zim> OK. I would like to take all the data-* and add it to a url
[08:23:30] <shoky> well then you are going about it all wrong
[08:24:02] <zim> so data-foo="bar" data-bar = "foo"  --> index.php?foo=bar&bar=foo
[08:24:19] <zim> shoky: I know :-)
[08:25:57] <zim> shoky: I think data() returns an object containing all data-* correct?
[08:26:01] <shoky> no
[08:26:27] <shoky> data() won't give you any of the data-* attributes unless you've specifically asked from them before
[08:26:42] <zim> this works fine $.post("index.php?path="+$(this).data("path"), $(this).data(), function(data){
[08:26:44] <shoky> and it'll also give you custom data that you've set, regardless of any data-* attributes
[08:26:56] <shoky> sec, i'll write you up smth
[08:27:01] <shoky> there's no shortcut for this
[08:27:06] <shoky> that i know of
[08:27:49] <zim> I last eg I gave posts all data-* to the data-path
[08:28:29] <RonWhoCares> I found this JQuery script for forms to cause an "OK" and "CANCEL" dialog to come up when a form is submitted BUT before it is processed.  I don't know where to add     id="form_submit_ok_cancel"   Could someone help me?  http://pastebin.ca/2166067
[08:31:02] <shoky> zim: var map={};  $.each( this.attributes, function(i,attr) { if (attr.name.indexOf('data-')==0) map[attr.name.slice(5)] = attr.value; } )
[08:31:23] <shoky> then map will be the key-value map that you want
[08:31:35] <zim> shoky: ty just doing a jsfiddle for RonWhoCares
[08:31:52] <shoky> then you can use $.param( map ) to serialize it into a query string
[08:32:38] <RonWhoCares> zim: Thank you   I tried, but it didn't work.  I found the script @ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9065972/jquery-trap-form-submit   (Under the heading '4 answers' with the Green check mark, with "2"
[08:34:31] <RonWhoCares> zim: I changed the ID to something generic I would use throughout my website whenever I need confirmation
[08:34:48] <shoky> zim: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/B3UXF/
[08:34:54] <zim> RonWhoCares: use a class then
[08:35:40] <RonWhoCares> zim I will , but it didn't work when I tried adding the ID tag to the <form> or the <submit> button
[08:37:58] <zim> RonWhoCares: Think thats what you are after but I would do it using .post
[08:38:39] <RonWhoCares> Where is the example
[08:38:40] <RonWhoCares> ?
[08:38:49] <zim> http://jsfiddle.net/3DxgT/1/
[08:38:55] <RonWhoCares> zim: I only want to apply this to certain forms
[08:39:41] <zim> yes then you only add your_class to the forms you want it to work on
[08:39:48] <RonWhoCares> ok
[08:40:42] <zim> RonWhoCares: you can have a class elemnt that looks like this class="foo bar more classes your_class"
[08:41:53] <zim> RonWhoCares: I would still read up in .post as it will make it less complicated.
[08:42:17] <opalepatrick> before I run off and do it myself, is there a plugin or script that I can use for a little memo area that I can drop into table cells and ajax-ize :-) ?nd
[08:42:42] <opalepatrick> Really so I can add comments to each row as to actions etc.
[08:43:13] <zim> opalepatrick: not 100% sure what you are after but have a look at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
[08:44:55] <RonWhoCares> zim: The JSFiddle didn't work --- the dialog isn't coming up http://jsfiddle.net/3DxgT/3/
[08:45:45] <RonWhoCares> zim: I don't mind doing it another way, so long as I can choose which forms are to receive the prompt.  Why I am trying to add this is because the form this will initially be used on is to shut down the users account
[08:45:56] <opalepatrick> zim - actually I like that tooltip, but it isnt what I am looking for. Actually I use zim as a standalone wiki on my desktop would you believe?
[08:46:26] <zim> LOL
[08:50:48] <RonWhoCares> zim: Do you see some reason why the jsfiddle didn't work
[09:00:45] <zim> RonWhoCares: try doing it like this http://jsfiddle.net/3DxgT/9/
[09:02:01] <RonWhoCares> zim That is MUCH simplier
[09:02:04] <RonWhoCares> Many many thanks
[09:02:11] <RonWhoCares> or Gracious if you are Spanish
[09:02:13] <RonWhoCares> hehe
[09:02:53] <zim> RonWhoCares: that is a simple eg. I would use .on rather than .click in a real script
[09:06:02] <RohanBhangui> sayxixhave a webpage styled by css and animation is done by jquery
[09:06:20] <RohanBhangui> and i want to use te draggable featre pf jquery ui
[09:06:36] <mparodi_> Hello
[09:06:37] <RohanBhangui> is it possible to just use the draggable feature
[09:06:54] <mparodi_> do you know an open source draggable slider like this one? http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/
[09:06:55] <zim> shoky: RohanBhangui yes
[09:07:08] <RohanBhangui> without having to style my content via jquery ui
[09:07:23] <shoky> wat?
[09:07:45] <RohanBhangui> you know how in jquery examples for draggables
[09:08:01] <RohanBhangui> they have the content in those styled boxes
[09:08:10] <RohanBhangui> cani do it wothput those boxes
[09:08:16] <shoky> RohanBhangui you don't need to style anything in order to use draggable
[09:08:31] <RohanBhangui> also in the example they have the scroll bars able to move
[09:08:59] <mparodi_> I can't find any free and open slider as good as http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/ :|
[09:09:09] <RohanBhangui> can i restrict that movement
[09:09:10] <zim> RohanBhangui: just add $('.class_name').draggable();
[09:09:21] <RohanBhangui> olay
[09:09:41] <zim> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[09:09:42] <shoky> RohanBhangui you can do mostly whatever you want. the scrollbars have nothing to do with the draggable, they're due to CSS overflow
[09:10:21] <RohanBhangui> okay
[09:10:29] <RohanBhangui> gotcha
[09:10:43] <zim> RohanBhangui: look at the options tab
[09:11:03] <RohanBhangui> thx sry i know this belongs i the jquery ui channel but it was a cross language question
[09:11:12] <shoky> this is the jquery ui channel
[09:11:20] <RohanBhangui> will do zim
[09:11:26] <shoky> and the only language here is javascript ;P
[09:11:41] <RohanBhangui> wait i thought there was a different chanmel
[09:11:50] <shoky> waiting.
[09:12:21] <RohanBhangui> i thought this channel was for jquery exclusively
[09:12:52] <shoky> sorry for shattering your assumptions
[09:13:27] <zim> jquery ui is part of jquery look at the top of you screen
[09:13:32] <shoky> no its not :\
[09:13:57] <zim> ok its part of the same dev
[09:14:11] <RohanBhangui> thats why he confusion
[09:14:15] <RohanBhangui> the
[09:14:27] <shoky> to avoid confusion, stop guessing.
[09:14:32] <shoky> and look around you
[09:14:38] <shoky> and read.
[09:15:31] <RohanBhangui> okay my bad
[09:17:40] <zim> shoky: still trying to understand what .data() is doing? your eg works great but why is this working? $.post("index.php?path="+$(this).data("path"), $(this).data(), function(reply){
[09:18:11] <shoky> zim: remove that $(this).data()
[09:18:18] <RohanBhangui> lol php?
[09:18:20] <shoky> it's serving no purpose
[09:18:58] <zim> shoky: it works. it posts all data-*
[09:19:07] <shoky> $(this).data() ?
[09:19:19] <RohanBhangui> out of curiousity what
[09:19:25] <RohanBhangui> is thay stuff for
[09:19:54] <shoky> RohanBhangui it's an ajax request to the server, common stuff
[09:20:24] <zim> RohanBhangui: I use data-* in a load of scripts to carry info that will need to be sent back to the server
[09:20:50] <shoky> zim were you asking why is this working or why is this NOT working ?
[09:21:45] <zim> shoky: I am asking how it works as you said $(this).data() does nothing
[09:22:20] <RohanBhangui> okay o get it
[09:23:23] <RohanBhangui> btw im on mobile but whatxia the latest version on jquery and jquery ui
[09:24:25] <shoky> zim: it might work sometimes. but it'll also add anything that you or any plugin has added with .data()  , regardless of any data-* attributes
[09:24:34] <mparodi_> how is that none created a draggable carousel yet!?
[09:25:37] <RohanBhangui> its a combination of two things make it yourself
[09:27:03] <zim> shoky: sorry on a call will brb
[09:28:06] <RohanBhangui> mparodi_, check out jquery uo and then search for a basic carousel plugin
[09:28:17] <mparodi_> uo?

[09:41:16] <RonWhoCares> Zam was helping me earlier, but I have missed something (likely obvious).  Wondering if someone would take a look.  The example Zam gave me is @ http://jsfiddle.net/3DxgT/14/  My attempt (which I need help with) is @ http://jsfiddle.net/X3xfe/1/
[09:41:30] <mparodi> RohanBhangui, how's my computer?

[09:48:18] <Desidakro> Hey Guys i need some help with lightstreamer, anyone that is familiar with it ?
[09:53:58] <zim> RonWhoCares: you will need to read up on .on that is not how you use it.
[09:54:51] <RonWhoCares> zim: Did I completely wreck what you tried to help me create
[09:55:35] <RonWhoCares> zim: Does the concept of what I am trying to do work?  or am I chasing a dead horse?
[09:55:38] <zim> RonWhoCares: also if you are going to only post hidden values don't bother with the form just hardcode it
[09:56:08] <RonWhoCares> zim: I want to learn how for future reference
[09:56:16] <gilaniali> Hi. I have trying to get a text field to submit using the following command in the Chrome Console. But its only input the value but not submitting it. Am I missing something: $(":input#prompt-input").val(11).submit();
[09:56:28] <gilaniali> *inputting
[09:56:41] <zim> RonWhoCares: is there a reason you are using post in this case rather that get?
[09:57:19] <RonWhoCares> zim: There is no special reason, other than 'post' being throughout the rest of the admin quite
[09:57:22] <RonWhoCares> zim: There is no special reason, other than 'post' being throughout the rest of the admin suite
[09:58:09] <RonWhoCares> zim: I have a learning disability.  I learn best hands on .... by example.  Once I grasp something then I do ok
[09:58:52] <zim> OK some pointers. .on is used like this $('#site_wrappper').on('click', '.path', function () {
[09:58:56] <wolfman2000> Morning/afternoon. http://jsfiddle.net/k6upr/  I'm trying to get the alert to show 1, 2, or 3, depending on which li I click. I always seem to get 4. How do I change the code to get the intended behavior?
[09:59:41] <zim> OK some pointers. .on is used like this $('#site_wrappper').on('click', '.class_of_item_being_clicked', function () {
[10:03:55] <RonWhoCares> zim $('#account_maintenance_cancel_user_account_form').on('click', '.account_maintenance_cancel_user_account_post_form', function () {
[10:04:13] <RonWhoCares> am I right?
[10:13:55] <zim> RonWhoCares: http://jsfiddle.net/X3xfe/6/
[10:14:31] <wolfman2000> ...nevermind. For those that want to know how I solved it, the update is here: http://jsfiddle.net/k6upr/1/
[10:17:06] <RonWhoCares> zim ok
[10:17:10] <RonWhoCares> zim This makes a lot more sense now
[10:17:21] <zim> wolfman2000: why not var yourvar = $(this).html();
[10:19:32] <RonWhoCares> zim: It works
[10:20:34] <zim> RonWhoCares: great
[10:21:30] <zim> wolfman2000: are you still there
[10:21:32] <wolfman2000> I am
[10:21:42] <wolfman2000> I'm trying to understand your solution, that's all.
[10:21:54] <zim> what is the 123?
[10:22:14] <wolfman2000> a grossly oversimplified example, in all honesty.
[10:22:27] <wolfman2000> The real code is a huge tabled form that I can't just share.
[10:22:34] <wolfman2000> So I had to shrink the example to as small as I could.
[10:22:56] <zim> what is the point. what do you want do with it?
[10:23:07] <zim> is it the value of the html
[10:23:21] <zim> or the number of the element?
[10:23:37] <wolfman2000> In hte simplified example, or the real code?
[10:24:11] <zim> in the real code what is the value 1
[10:24:37] <zim> is it the html or a way to id that row?
[10:25:42] <wolfman2000> in the real code, if I were to alert, it would alert HTML at this point.
[10:26:03] * wolfman2000 hopes he's understanding the question right...at least he has worked out a solution for his project regardless.
[10:26:07] <zim> wolfman2000: ok the I will show you an eg hold on
[10:28:07] <zim> wolfman2000: http://jsfiddle.net/k6upr/2/
[10:29:00] <zim> wolfman2000: is that what you are after?
[10:29:00] <wolfman2000> That alerts just the number itself. I'll have to look up the .html docs
[10:29:49] <wolfman2000> zim: while that tidbit probably has some use, it is not what I need. I need the count.
[10:30:00] <wolfman2000> Hence, I'm sticking with my first solution
[10:31:01] <zim> wolfman2000: thats why I asked what the end result required
[10:41:42] <Canyon_> hi
[10:42:29] <qwerty121> Howdy, Canyon_
[10:42:29] <Canyon_> i want to build a hierarchial menu with 10000 elements, under 4 directories. I've started from here: http://www.lateralcode.com/directory-trees-with-php-and-jquery/
[10:42:38] <Canyon_> but it seems that it's not a very good ideea.
[10:43:05] <Canyon_> i'd get a 5MB page, and out of resources errors.
[10:43:16] <zim> shoky: you still here?
[10:43:52] <Canyon_> i want to say that i'm a very beginner in this area(web development) and I don't know the way of doing things
[10:44:14] <tw2113> everyone was there at one point
[10:45:01] <zim> Canyon_: why so big?
[10:45:06] <Canyon_> IMHO, the menu should be downloaded step by, step, depending on the directory that the user selects. but I have no ideea how to achieve it.
[10:45:34] <zim> Canyon_: use ajax
[10:45:41] <shoky> zim ya
[10:45:47] <zim> var mystring = $.param($(this).data());
[10:46:01] <zim> shoky: ^^^^
[10:46:25] <qwerty121> Canyon_, use a plugin that uses ajax
[10:46:32] <Canyon_> zim, would it be easy to implement ajax on this example? http://www.lateralcode.com/directory-trees-with-php-and-jquery/
[10:46:51] <shoky> zim: it's simple. do you want to get data-* attributes, or do you want to get what .data() gives you
[10:47:02] <shoky> they are different things
[10:47:51] <shoky> and i've seen places where .data() doesn't give you the data-* attributes, though i don't know/remember what causes it
[10:47:59] <zim> I thought .data() was the data-*
[10:48:02] <shoky> it's not
[10:48:09] <commandocoding> Hello room, I am a prototype.js user, I need to know a few simple things about jquerymobile, 1st question is [Q1] does jquery mobile allow animation style effects on mobiles or does it make good accessible code so that on mobiles it gracefully works with HTML .
[10:49:06] <shoky> zim: .data(...) is a way to store arbitrary data to be correlated with a specific DOM element. <-- nothing to do with data-* attributes
[10:49:20] <shoky> as a bonus, .data(..) ALSO gets the data-* attributes
[10:49:45] <shoky> zim: if you do  $(this).data('myDataKey', 'someData');
[10:50:05] <shoky> zim: then .data() will give you that key also even though it's not one of the data-* attributes
[10:50:28] <zim> shoky: Ah ok I have only used it to get the data-*
[10:51:20] <shoky> if it works for you, cool.
[10:53:19] <shoky> zim also check out http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/NcbyK/
[10:53:36] <shoky> even though i added a data-* attribute, .data() didn't retrieve it
[10:53:58] <shoky> (if you comment the first line it works though :P )
[10:54:51] <zim> http://jsfiddle.net/NcbyK/1/
[10:55:04] <shoky> yes
[10:55:54] <zim> so it only works with data-* that is there when the page is loaded correct?
[10:56:17] <shoky> it only works with data-* that is there the first time you call .data()
[10:56:34] <shoky> zim: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:56:39] <shoky> it's all there
[10:56:41] <zim> gotcha ty
[11:23:37] <pablosss> Hi. Where is the standard css for dialog example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/  ? I can not find :(
[11:25:46] <Hereisanotherlie> pablosss: that's not css
[11:26:08] <Hereisanotherlie> oh whoops n/m ignore me
[11:27:29] <pablosss> Hereisanotherlie This is theme?
[11:27:44] <pablosss> How use theme in own code?
[11:29:55] <Hereisanotherlie> pablosss: it says to use the ThemeRoller application for theming the dialog http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/Themeroller or you can modify the look with jquery.ui.dialog.css
[11:30:11] <Hereisanotherlie> it's just a matter of preference really
[11:30:40] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/2/ - how do I make the last dropdown not go outside the body, like in the example? (i.e. right-aligned with the last link)
[11:30:47] <pablosss> Hereisanotherlie Thank you!
[11:35:18] <poppiez> is it possible to detect when append, prepend, html and empty is called on $('body')?
[11:35:29] <poppiez> I want to trigger a specific action each time one of those happens
[11:36:36] <Hereisanotherlie> mikkelb: you want current and the two "test" drop downs  to be on the same line?
[11:36:56] <mikkelb> Hereisanotherlie: no
[11:36:56] <Hereisanotherlie> does "Goal" play into that at all?
[11:37:04] <mikkelb> Goal is just a picture of how I want it to be
[11:37:13] <Hereisanotherlie> oh the picture isn't showing up
[11:37:15] <mikkelb> I want the dropdown on the last link to not go outside the body
[11:37:22] <mikkelb> weird - it should show up
[11:38:00] <Hereisanotherlie> it's cool I went to the link idk why it wasn't showing up in the fiddle
[12:01:51] <mparodi> is it possible to use .animate() with "transform" ?
[12:02:28] <mparodi> I want to animate a rotation:       transform: rotation(0deg)        ->           transform: rotation(10deg)
[12:02:30] <mparodi> for example ^
[12:03:09] <mikkelb> Hereisanotherlie: cool
[12:03:17] <mikkelb> Hereisanotherlie: no word of advice though?
[12:08:55] <zim> Hi all. is there a way to stop .param( ) from replacing using URL-encoding? ie  / with %2F
[12:09:54] <shoky> zim, why?
[12:10:31] <zim> because is dicking with stuff I want left alone
[12:10:34] <zim> :-)
[12:11:15] <shoky> well you could always decodeURIComponent on what you got to decode the %2F codes
[12:12:10] <shoky> ?js decodeURIComponent( $.param( {lol:'heh//%^&'} ) )
[12:12:17] <bot-t> shoky: "lol=heh//%^&" (Process Killed)
[12:12:24] <zim> I could also replace $x with $y but a ,don't_dick would be easier :-)
[12:12:33] <shoky> wat_
[13:12:40] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/3/ - how do I make the dropdown for the last link not go outside the body, like in the attached picture?
[13:29:40] <shoky> mikkelb: link is br0ken
[13:32:03] <mikkelb> sorry
[13:32:06] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/tDnHE/5/ - how do I make the dropdown for the last link not go outside the body? (like in the example)
[13:48:26] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/9/ Could someone help me with the first function for updating the right div's html on ajax success. If I hard code a div, it works correctly.
[13:51:33] <tman-> is there a way to fiind the first instance of a dom element in reverse from where you presently are in the DOM?  i'm in a list and need to do like 4 .parents() to target the element i ant
[13:51:36] <tman-> and that's ugly :(
[13:57:36] <shoky> tman- try .closer()
[13:57:51] <shoky> closest() i mean
[13:58:01] <josefig> is there a way to disable the close button for a dialog ?
[13:59:41] * tman- looks that up
[14:00:20] <tman-> ah yes, this is what i need thx
[14:04:39] <brrc> Hello everyone, i'm having some trouble calling gmaps from display:none / hidden with gmaps plugin from jquery, when the map comes up it gets mispalced, -> http://www.denisewhitesotogrande.com/new/results.php (click on "View this selection of properties on a map")
[14:18:27] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/13/ I'm trying to update the html of a div on a click. I'm just having trouble targeting the div through JS.
[14:20:31] <nlogax> I get this before even ruining stuff. Any ideas? https://paste.lugons.org/show/LOhSDsPFKWcMlp4dWZxo/
[14:20:37] <shoky> brrc: when i try it without the popup: true  it seems better ;S
[14:20:46] <nlogax> Oops, nvm
[14:21:09] <brrc> shocky because i need to send values to the parent window and didnt find a way for that either
[14:22:31] <brrc> shoky: I need send to the gmap, and from the marker displayed with information and a link to a display engine in php
[14:22:36] <brrc> or to a results
[14:22:52] <brrc> been searching for  this for days :d
[14:44:15] <pflock> where do I get icons free for commercial use?
[14:44:39] <pifantastic> pflock: there are a few sets
[14:44:50] <pifantastic> http://www.famfamfam.com/ is a classic
[14:44:50] <pflock> where?
[14:45:04] <zim> try http://www.iconfinder.com/
[14:45:09] <pifantastic> and http://thenounproject.com/ @pflock
[14:45:29] <pflock> thanks a lot!
[14:45:53] <pflock> do all this sites only contain images under licenses that allow commercial use?
[14:46:46] <zim> not sure read there T&Cs
[14:47:08] <pifantastic> pflock: each site should describe its license
[14:47:19] <pifantastic> but im pretty sure fam fam fam is CC and the noun project is unrestricted
[14:47:46] <pflock> ok thanks
[14:51:54] <zim> http://www.iconfinder.com/browse shows the licence for each set
[14:56:11] <zim> if I have a string 1+2+3+4 and .replace('+', '-') why is it only replacing the first instance ?
[14:57:42] <shoky> zim: .replace('/\+/g', '-')
[14:57:48] <shoky> oops
[14:57:53] <shoky> zim: .replace(/\+/g, '-')
[14:58:14] <Woet> zim: http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-replace
[15:00:41] <shoky> or better yet.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[15:27:19] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/KEBV3/14/ I'm trying to update the html of a div on a click. I'm just having trouble targeting the div through JS. If anyone could take a look at the first function. Thx.
[15:29:53] <pifantastic> Murg|e: what exactly is the problem?
[15:30:32] <pifantastic> Murg|e: http://jsfiddle.net/pdHjR/1/
[15:30:35] <pifantastic> ?html
[15:30:42] <pifantastic> it's a function, not a property
[15:31:13] <Murg|e> The issue is when I click the button, the div should be replaced with the result.
[15:31:29] <Murg|e> But I can see you got it.
[15:31:59] <Murg|e> All I was missing was (result)?
[15:32:06] <Murg|e> So close. Thanks pifantastic.
[15:32:24] <pifantastic> Murg|e: right, you were treating .html as a property, but it's a function
[15:35:46] <Murg|e> Sweet, the ajax success works perfect now. Thx again pifantastic.
[15:35:55] <pifantastic> Murg|e: np
[15:49:19] <tw2113> how do I select part of an ID that I know will be consistent, with the rest of the ID being randomized on page loa?
[15:49:21] <tw2113> load*
[15:49:37] <tw2113> bit of regex i'm sure, but i can't quite think of the syntax for it
[15:50:51] <mparodi> do you know any plugin to simulate dragging with gravity/attraction? for instance, if you have two circles and you drag one, the other one should move as well
[15:52:40] <shoky> tw2113 whatcha mean?
[15:53:20] <tw2113> say there's an element that gets this for an ID on a page load: "my_id_12345"
[15:53:28] <tw2113> hit refresh and it's "my_id_54321"
[15:53:36] <tw2113> and so on and so on
[15:53:52] <tw2113> trying to figure out how to select it by "my_id_"
[15:54:13] <CmdrTallen> starts with selector should work ^=
[15:54:44] <shoky> yep
[15:55:16] <shoky> [id^=my_id_]
[15:55:29] <tw2113> gotcha
[15:55:30] <tw2113> thanks
[16:15:17] <tman-> hey, i'm trying to figure out how to loop through a directory of images an echo out the results into a container which I can then manipulate with js to suite my needs
[16:15:32] <tman-> lots of examples on stackoverflow but i can't get it to work
[16:15:58] <tman-> trying to understand if it's possible to create a function which has php in it that can take a js argument.. starting to think that's not doable
[16:16:04] <tman-> since php renders before the client gets it.
[16:16:18] <tman-> you'd think a concise solution would be out there.
[16:21:10] <mparodi> is there an event to do something when a div changes its -absolute- position?
[16:23:46] <tw2113> how would I go about getting rid of the div# on this? div#lmm_map_b4171b66.
[16:24:03] <tw2113> tried split and replace both in firefox scratchpad
[16:24:11] <tw2113> but those are complaining
[16:24:22] <tw2113> i think i may have an object and not string
[16:26:15] <mansour> I have an iframe and loading the contents with: myframe.location.href = $("#url").val() ;
[16:26:32] <mansour> I need to add onclick event for the loaded document.
[16:26:38] <mansour> how can I do this ??
[16:27:04] <mansour> is that possible ??
[16:27:38] <gnarf> mansour: same domain?
[16:27:40] <gnarf> ?sop
[16:27:46] * gnarf frowns at bot-t
[16:28:03] <gnarf> ?g same origin policy
[16:28:40] <mansour> gnarf: no different domain.
[16:28:56] <gnarf> mansour: then it's pretty much impossible
[16:29:20] <jasonenglish> mansour: im curious what the context of this is
[16:29:53] <mansour> hum, ok I need to be able to click an element loaded and generate an XPATH to produce a parser for that page to be integrated with a crawler.
[16:30:14] <shoky> tw2113:  .slice(4) ?
[16:30:32] <mansour> the system should be used by non technical users loging to the portal to add/ create parsers for existing ecommerce sites.
[16:30:47] <mansour> Not sure if there's a better way, or an alternative.
[16:31:14] <tw2113> i may be able to disregard
[16:31:15] <mansour> the only alternative I can see if doing a java applet .. any idea ??
[16:31:22] <tw2113> map[0].id returned what i needed
[16:31:28] <jasonenglish> i see what you're trying to do
[16:31:39] <jasonenglish> you're trying to map a page so they can pull specific information
[16:31:40] <ProLoser|Work> any suggestions on an easy way to break this into a nested object? "details.info[0].name"
[16:31:52] <tw2113> after assigning to a map var
[16:32:18] <jasonenglish> mansour: ive seen sites do this, either a browser plugin or a bookmarklet would get that to work
[16:32:18] <mansour> jasonenglish: exactely. I need onClick for the document in IFrame to work so that I can generate xpath.
[16:32:54] <jasonenglish> mansour: my understand of how it was done was, it would inject your own script on the page with the bookmarket, then give you specific controls, then just talk back to your own server
[16:33:17] <jasonenglish> mansour: its definitely possible, i really wish i could think of the service that does it, highlighting services have this functionality
[16:34:25] <jasonenglish> mansour: basically set the elements they want to extract, then your server will know which elements or data to extract when it parses the page
[16:34:26] <mansour> jasonenglish: I don't understand. Are you saying it's possible with JS or with other languages ??
[16:35:07] <mansour> jasonenglish: still even if I want to do it on the server, I still need to add events to the document loaded in the IFrame.
[16:35:40] <jasonenglish> mansour: if you want to add a set of ui tools to a page, for a user to be able to click/select elements on any domain, you can create a bookmarklet or a plugin that will allow you to do this, once you have that part completed, you can communicate the details back to your server for further processing
[16:36:12] <jasonenglish> i am saying its possible with js
[16:36:13] <mansour> bookmarklet ?? never heard of it.
[16:36:20] <jasonenglish> one second, let me find you an example
[16:36:33] <mansour> ok, thank you jasonenglish.
[16:38:23] <mansour> jasonenglish: I am reading about it. The problem is I feel very close to be able to do it.
[16:38:39] <jasonenglish> feel very close?
[16:39:20] <mansour> I mean I was able to generate evens from IFrame, but before the document is loaded.
[16:39:39] <mansour> let me try to create an example,
[16:39:44] <mansour> give me few minutes
[16:40:02] <jasonenglish> http://www.marker.to/
[16:42:58] <shoky> ProLoser|Work: that seems to already be nested, no?
[16:43:11] <mansour> ok, I see what you mean. This needs to install something. The requirements didn't state that I can install additional things, so everthing has to be done through the portal page.
[16:44:49] <jasonenglish> that sucks
[16:45:13] <jasonenglish> from a usability perspective, extensions > bookmarklet > your requirement
[16:45:29] <jasonenglish> extensions allow the tool to be added automatically on every page
[16:45:36] <jasonenglish> bookmarklet has to be invoked by the user
[16:46:11] <jasonenglish> and i imagine the method you have to use requires them to enter in external addresses in an iframe?
[16:51:43] <jasonenglish> mansour: i would be happy to look at an example, if you want
[16:52:44] <mansour> jasonenglish: yes. What I am doing is working for a local pages, but not remote ones. I appreciate your help. I will post the example.
[16:53:38] <tw2113> it's not possible to turn part of an object into an actual variable is it
[16:53:51] <shoky> meaning?
[16:54:07] <shoky> var obj = {prop: 5}; var prop = obj.prop;  ?
[16:54:22] <tw2113> var mapObj = jQuery('[id^=lmm_map_]');
[16:54:31] <tw2113> turn mapObj[0].id into an actual variable
[16:54:45] <shoky> what do you mean by actual variable
[16:55:12] <tw2113> the script i'm trying to debug uses something like lmm_map_30a349a5
[16:55:20] <tw2113> for both the ID and the variable name
[16:55:34] <tw2113> i'm able to retrieve that as a string
[16:55:49] <tw2113> separate from the rest of the plugin
[16:55:55] <mansour> jasonenglish: here's a short example with 3 html docs for testing. http://pastebin.com/9NBgfpJF
[16:56:10] <tw2113> i'm basically trying to sidestep a lot of plugin editing
[16:56:35] <shoky> you want to turn the string "lmm_map_xxx" into a reference to the variable named "lmm_map_xxx" ?
[16:56:44] <tw2113> yes
[16:56:47] <shoky> eek ;D
[16:56:49] <tw2113> if possible
[16:56:51] <jasonenglish> mansour: ill take a look in a sec
[16:57:08] <shoky> tw2113 in what scope is the variable?
[16:57:33] <shoky> tw2113 if its in global scope you could just do window[ theVariableName ]
[16:57:47] <tw2113> var lmm_map_30a349a5 = {}; (function($) { //bunch of leaflet stuff
[16:57:57] <tw2113> all within a basic <script> tag
[16:58:12] <tw2113> and i'm trying to add to the same map, elsewhere because the guy i'm helping doesn't know jack
[16:58:19] <tw2113> wants current location added to it
[16:58:29] <tw2113> and the WP plugin doesn't offer "current location" markers
[16:58:42] <shoky> ok. window[ mapObj[0].id ].push(blah) i guess
[16:58:52] <tw2113> if the ID/var was consistent, i'd be happy and no bitchy
[16:59:09] <tw2113> people who did the plugin added md5 generated strings at the end
[16:59:16] <mansour> jasonenglish: thank you
[17:00:18] <shoky> WP seems like such a pain. (not from my experience, i've only ever used it once for a tiny proj)
[17:01:03] <tw2113> this is from a 3rd party plugin scumbag
[17:08:18] <jasonenglish> mansour: what did your test result in?
[17:09:30] <shoky> i wanna meet that scumbag
[17:09:35] <shoky> and send him links
[17:09:41] <shoky> and bbq together.

[17:15:03] <qom2> could you elaborate on that? it was working before, but I must've changed something
[17:15:23] <qom2> oh
[17:15:24] <qom2> doh
[17:15:25] <qom2> thanks!
[17:15:28] <jasonenglish> np
[17:17:49] <Xedecimal> When I do something like $.get('test'); and 'test' returns something like <div><script src="whatever"></script></div>. Jquery will move the 'script' tag in the dom adjacent to 'div' and say if I'm doing something like a dialog on it, I'll get 2 dialogs, has anyone found a way to get around this ? I've even tried a whole $.get().success(function (data) { $(data).filter('script').remove(); }); and it won't go away, at least not th
[17:17:49] <Xedecimal> at I'm aware of, this is just nuts
[17:19:06] <Xedecimal> I also want the script to get destroyed when the content is destroyed with the dom, is this why this happens is because this is not possible?
[17:19:47] <shoky> ok i sent him links.
[17:20:30] <jasonenglish> xedecimal: can you provide an example
[17:21:55] <Xedecimal> I have a bunch of little modules in a system, I want to create a dialog, which has a bunch of callbacks so all my little modules can append themselves, their css, their scripts and output to this dialog to provide bits and pieces of information on whatever the dialog is presenting detail on. I don't want all these bits and pieces loading up constantly if this dialog is not being used, but if it does I guess it could be kept load
[17:21:55] <Xedecimal> ed that's ok, one nifty part is that I can alter some php, then run some javascript that loads the new content without reloading the entire page
[17:22:58] <gnarf> Xedecimal: use $.ajax
[17:23:19] <Xedecimal> I'm guessing I'm not going to be able to unload it though from what I'm reading about on stackexchange and such right ?
[17:23:20] <gnarf> Xedecimal: but its actually the $( data ) part that is causing the issue
[17:23:42] <gnarf> Xedecimal: your ajax response really should avoid having any script tags
[17:24:02] <gnarf> sometimes you can't avoid it
[17:24:14] <gnarf> but it is possible to get around it
[17:24:35] <Xedecimal> this thing specifically for example, will load up a movie trailer, some code for toggling visibility of it, some code for flipping through covers or backdrops, and it's just a ton of crap that doesn't get used anywhere else
[17:24:52] <gnarf> Xedecimal: fair
[17:25:06] <gnarf> try doing target.append( data ) directly
[17:25:21] <gnarf> also, make sure that dataType is "text" not "html"
[17:25:25] <gnarf> on the ajax call
[17:25:43] <Xedecimal> like $('<div/>').load(something).dialog({yada yada}); ?
[17:25:53] <gnarf> no
[17:25:55] <Xedecimal> so I'm working with a string instead of a $(object) ?
[17:26:12] <gnarf> .load will make it worse
[17:26:27] <Xedecimal> so something like $('<div />').append($.ajaxresults); ?
[17:26:39] <gnarf> that will also be horrible
[17:26:45] <gnarf> you need to append it to the dom directly
[17:26:45] <Xedecimal> err, other way around, results.append($('</div>');
[17:26:49] <gnarf> or you will have issues
[17:26:52] <Xedecimal> with some more ) stuff
[17:27:28] <Xedecimal> create the dialog, then $('#my-dialog-div').append($.ajax_results); ?
[17:27:30] <gnarf> using $.ajax({ url:url, dataType: "text" }).done( function( data ) { targetArea.append( data ); }); will cause jQuery to add the elements to the dom, THEN execute the script
[17:27:41] <gnarf> sure
[17:27:45] <Xedecimal> alllllllrighty!
[17:27:54] <Xedecimal> gonna plug this stuff in and see what happens!
[17:27:59] <gnarf> $.ajax({ url:url, dataType: "text" }).done( function( data ) { $("<div>").dialog().append( data ); });
[17:28:16] <gnarf> hopefully that works for you
[17:28:36] <Xedecimal> can't I use $.get(url, null, 'text') similarly ?
[17:28:37] <gnarf> jQuery's treating of <script> tags in its .html() is awkward at best
[17:29:06] <gnarf> Xedecimal: maybe - I avoid $.get / $.post like the plague
[17:29:15] <Xedecimal> I'll try both, starting with your $.ajax
[17:29:27] <gnarf> I wish I could deprecate em
[17:29:34] <gnarf> but people would try to kill me with an ice pick
[17:29:51] <gnarf> We've done a lot of work in the 1.8 branch on <script> tags too
[17:29:55] <systemfault> gnarf: Haha, do it faggott!!!
[17:29:57] <systemfault> ;)
[17:29:57] <gnarf> so you might want to double check them :)
[17:29:59] <systemfault> j/k
[17:30:12] <gnarf> systemfault: wtf?
[17:30:21] <systemfault> But yeah, I think that get/getJSON/post should be deprecated
[17:30:36] <systemfault> gnarf: I've seen too much 4chan :/
[17:30:50] <gnarf> I agree on both counts, stop bein a hater
[17:30:55] <Xedecimal> I was gonna say systemfault sounded like op
[17:30:59] <systemfault> haha
[17:31:24] <gnarf> boo
[17:31:31] <gnarf> ;)
[17:31:51] <systemfault> gnarf: I think that the multiple facades on $.ajax confuses users more than it helps them
[17:32:12] <gnarf> systemfault: I tend to agree, but there is way to much code depending on those abstractions.
[17:32:19] <systemfault> True
[17:32:34] <coldhead> you can just ignore the facades that confuse you
[17:32:38] <gnarf> not that they couldn't implement the abstraction themselves in like one line of code
[17:32:39] <systemfault> Could they break compatibility with 2.0?
[17:32:50] <systemfault> coldhead: They don't confuse me personally.. at all
[17:32:52] <coldhead> for "designers" its nice that they can go "i need to do a POST, so i'll use .post()"
[17:32:55] <Xedecimal> sorry to say this gnarf, I got bad news... It works like a charm, you're a genius!
[17:33:06] <coldhead> and the pros can massage ajax as needed
[17:33:12] <gnarf> Xedecimal: I've fought that exact same problem many times before :)
[17:33:29] <gnarf> coldhead: I know... but it's just so... meh...
[17:33:37] <systemfault> coldhead: Designers should not touch the code :D
[17:33:48] <coldhead> everyone should touch the code!
[17:34:01] <systemfault> coldhead: Don't touch my code, pervert!
[17:34:16] <coldhead> eeh hehehehe
[17:34:18] <mansour> jasonenglish: sorry I was away.
[17:34:32] <mansour> are you still here ??
[17:34:37] <jasonenglish> yup
[17:34:57] <mansour> jasonenglish: if you click the link in the IFrame, you will get events.
[17:35:13] <mansour> events work as expected.
[17:35:39] <jasonenglish> hmm, i guess i was mistaken, is the iframes domain different?
[17:35:51] <mansour> however, try to load another document form different domain, like http://www.cnn.com, it will not work.
[17:35:58] <jasonenglish> right
[17:36:05] <jasonenglish> you're testing on your own domain
[17:36:08] <jasonenglish> correct?
[17:36:18] <mansour> this is due to the same domain restriction.
[17:36:24] <jasonenglish> yup
[17:36:44] <mansour> this is what I need to over come, so I tried : document.domain = "www.cnn.com";
[17:36:52] <mansour> but it didn't work either.
[17:36:57] <jasonenglish> i dont know your projects requirements, but if you're looking for a user friendly way of allowing people to select page elements, an extension or bookmarklet is i think your best bet
[17:38:09] <mansour> ok, will consider this. THe only  reason is I feel closer to do it this way rather than learning how to do it with bookmarlet and try to ask if I am allowed to do it this way.
[17:38:44] <jasonenglish> well, i think extension > bookmarklet, since it will auto inject your js
[17:39:08] <gnarf> mansour: google "same origin policy"
[17:40:10] <mansour> gnarf: thank you.
[17:41:25] <mansour> gnarf: http://javascript.info/tutorial/same-origin-security-policy#example
[17:43:04] <jasonenglish> gnarf: he can't get around it for what he's trying to accomplish, i think?
[17:43:15] <gnarf> jasonenglish: thats the point
[17:43:21] <jasonenglish> gotcha
[17:43:27] <gnarf> mansour: your only hope
[17:43:48] <gnarf> is to have control of the remote domain
[17:43:58] <gnarf> and add scripts on the remote page
[17:44:08] <gnarf> that or use something like greasemonkey to inject
[17:44:20] <mansour> gnarf: may be this is the only way.
[17:44:56] <jasonenglish> they could just open a new tab, with an extension that injects your js, create a nice ui on their page, and then let them do their thing
[17:45:36] <jasonenglish> imo, the iframe seems like a poor way, even if it was possible, of interacting with the page
[17:45:51] <jasonenglish> if i were the user, i would want the full page to load normally, and quickly click on what i want to "tag"
[17:48:23] <jasonenglish> never used this, but a quick google search shows a site with an example of what im talking about
[17:48:37] <jasonenglish> http://www.awesomehighlighter.com/user/welcome/
[17:49:28] <mansour> jasonenglish: I think the best way for me is to write a server side script that will download the page, and send a generated id back to the broswer, then the brwser would set the src for the iframe to that page.
[17:50:05] <jasonenglish> how is the user going to click on the elements in the page?
[17:50:39] <jasonenglish> you said before, they would need to interact with the page and select certain elements, the point of wanting the events
[17:50:45] <mansour> by loading the page from the server into the iframe.
[17:50:53] <mansour> do you think this would work ??
[17:51:04] <optraz> systemfault: hi
[17:51:29] <jasonenglish> it would work, seems like a lot of extra work though
[17:51:40] <jasonenglish> ill leave it up to you to do the research, but think through the options
[17:51:43] <gnarf> mansour: none of the non-absolute image/link urls would work
[17:51:50] <gnarf> its a real pain in the ass
[17:51:52] <jasonenglish> or the css
[17:52:01] <gnarf> or the scripts
[17:52:02] <jasonenglish> depending on how its linked
[17:53:59] <mansour> graydot: yep you are right about this.
[17:54:05] <mansour> good catch.
[17:54:27] <mansour> sorry talking to gnarf and not graydot.
[17:58:48] <gnarf> mansour: a browser extension / bookmarklet that injects your own script tag is prolly a better approac as jasonenglish suggested
[17:59:01] <Whirl3d> Good evenin all. Would someone mind looking at this simple function to parse one object into another? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/esXrJ/7/
[17:59:22] <mansour> gnarf: how easy to implement. I haven't done anything with it before.
[17:59:50] <Whirl3d> I have included comments and I thought it was going to be ugly, but easy to do and yet I am just not getting the result that I need. I'm sure it's a missing } or something..
[18:00:11] <mansour> I will suggest to the team if it's possible to do it as a desktop application. I think this is the safest and most straight forward way.
[18:03:09] <Whirl3d> I am also completely open to doing this a different way if anyone has any suggestions..
[18:03:13] <shoky> Whirl3d: check your use of .indexOf
[18:03:24] <gnarf> mansour: ??? browser extensions are pretty straightforward
[18:03:42] <gnarf> also - bookmarklet is win
[18:03:49] <shoky> Whirl3d: hint: it doesn't return 0 if the substring isn't found
[18:04:08] <Whirl3d> I thought it returned -1
[18:04:19] <Whirl3d> looking now
[18:04:22] <shoky> it does
[18:04:31] <Whirl3d> which is false, right?
[18:04:39] <shoky> nope
[18:04:43] <mansour> gnarf: I haven't done anything with it.
[18:04:43] <shoky> 0 is false
[18:05:39] <Whirl3d> oh! Wow! you do not know how many times I have messed that up. I thought that in some cases 0 was iffy  (sometimes false, sometimes undefined or something) and -1 was always false, 1 was always true...wow.
[18:06:31] <Whirl3d> but indexof returning 0 as false is messed up
[18:06:33] <shoky> :P
[18:06:37] <Whirl3d> 0 is a valid index
[18:06:39] <shoky> why 0 as false?
[18:06:41] <shoky> -1 as false
[18:06:48] <shoky> 0 is indeed valid
[18:06:59] <Whirl3d> so you just said 0 is false
[18:07:10] <shoky> that's why they use -1 instead of 0 to signify that it didn't find
[18:07:17] <shoky> 0 == false
[18:07:24] <shoky> but indexOf returns -1 if not found
[18:07:25] <shoky> not 0
[18:07:48] <shoky> which makes perfect sense
[18:08:14] <Whirl3d> that's exactly how I thought it worked, except that -1 != false
[18:08:30] <shoky> it's != false
[18:08:42] <shoky> er i gues that's what you meant
[18:08:52] <Whirl3d> no, I had it wrong
[18:09:23] <Whirl3d> it just seems really weird. I like my fantasy better. -1 is always false, 1 is always true and 0 is contextual
[18:09:28] <Whirl3d> that makes mroe sense
[18:09:29] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:09:32] <shoky> huh :)
[18:09:54] <shoky> best to think of it .. that there is no true/false here
[18:10:02] <shoky> indexOf returns an index. or -1. that's it :P
[18:11:12] <Whirl3d> I have pages and pages and pages of code that relies on indexof returning -1, but expects -1 to be false. I bet 60% of the problems I have been having with my animation engine are the result of that one piece of stupidity. Wow. Thanks tons
[18:11:33] <shoky> ;] np
[18:12:24] <Whirl3d> so should I compare to >-1? or !=-1  which is better?
[18:13:01] <shoky> i use >= 0 usually
[18:13:19] <shoky> no real reason i suppose
[18:13:38] <shoky> >-1 and !=-1 will work just as good
[18:16:07] <gnarf> ircjsbot: eval ~-1
[18:16:20] <gnarf> hrm
[18:16:35] <gnarf> i thought he added an eval to that thing already
[18:16:56] <Whirl3d> ? eval ~-1
[18:17:12] <Whirl3d> I saw someone do it like that the other day...
[18:17:48] <Whirl3d> gnarf have you seen johnkpauls prefixed event handlers?
[18:18:09] <gnarf> nope
[18:19:10] <Whirl3d> It's really cool actually (though probably not best practice) that lets you append to any event the before and after prefixt o fire before the event and after. it could be really useful for your new animation methods
[18:22:02] <Whirl3d> maybe what I am trying to accomplish is what you are referring to as prefilters.
[18:22:28] <Whirl3d> I assume you mean like the ajax prefilter (which I have never used)
[18:24:57] <gnarf> prefilters get passed the properties and options as well as the animation object so you can edit them before the animation stops
[18:25:40] <gnarf> Whirl3d: ~-1 === 0, and ~0 === -1  --- ~ is bitwise not
[18:26:14] <Whirl3d> But they don't necesarily filter which elements are animated nor do they set an initialization state on the animation targets right?
[18:26:26] <Whirl3d> so are you saying that ~-1 is best?
[18:27:05] <Whirl3d> no no no, sorry, I misread.
[18:31:40] <gnarf> ~str.indexOf("test") is "falsy" when test doesn't exist
[18:31:47] <gnarf> it's kinda esoteric javascript
[18:31:48] <gnarf> but it works
[18:32:26] <gnarf> if you aren't working on code that other people need to maintain or see
[18:32:28] <gnarf> use it
[18:42:13] <Murg|e> I have this bug where when I reload content into a div via ajax success, the jquery functions aren't being applied to that content. Anyone had experience with this?
[18:44:31] <gnarf> Murg|e: jQuery can only operate on things currently in the DOM - you should look up the docs on on() and read the section on delegated events http://api.jquery.com/on
[18:45:01] <Murg|e> Thanks for pointing me in the right direction gnarf.
[18:45:20] <gnarf> Murg|e: you basically want to bind your event to the container who's html content is being replaced, with your selectors there
[20:05:50] <tintin> If i click any link it will create a <div>..</div>  it there will data inside it getting from database, how can i do it using jquery?
[20:06:39] <tintin> My question is: when i will reload/refresh that web page the <div>..with data..</div>  will still be there
[20:07:22] <tintin> shoky: Hi
[20:07:37] <ThrushAAX> tintin: you should load the page from the server on page refresh
[20:08:02] <ThrushAAX> with jquery you can use the ajax methods to load the data... but it won't still be there when you refresh the page
[20:08:07] <ThrushAAX> unless you load it with ajax again
[20:08:21] <tintin> This page will contains the original post and comments below it, all data comes from database
[20:08:56] <tintin> If i click the comment button <div> will be created and it will be put at the end of the comment list
[20:09:14] <tintin> If i reload it the div will be still there attached, something like facebook commenting
[20:09:31] <ThrushAAX> yeah, you need to use ajax and send it to the server then
[20:09:37] <ThrushAAX> so that it is stored in the database
[20:09:40] <tintin> Suppose, $("#foo").append("<div>hello world</div>")
[20:10:01] <tintin> The database will contain the comment,
[20:10:12] <tintin> Will database contain the html tag too ?
[20:10:21] <ThrushAAX> $.post("/some/url",{comment:"helow world"})
[20:10:22] <tintin> like will it contain, <div>..
[20:10:30] <ThrushAAX> or something like that
[20:10:42] <tintin> Ok, that's good, that will post comment
[20:10:50] <tintin> But what about creating <div>
[20:11:01] <tintin> permanent <div> or html elemetn
[20:11:13] <ThrushAAX> you can't permanly create something with javascript
[20:11:49] <tintin> Won't it "$("#foo").append("<div>hello world</div>")" create permanent div?
[20:12:03] <ThrushAAX> it will be gone when the page is refreshed
[20:12:29] <ThrushAAX> either the server sends the content, or the javascript has to create it again on the client
[20:12:43] <ThrushAAX> try it out for yourself
[20:13:32] <tintin> What does facebook comment do?
[20:13:49] <tintin> Then how is it good to do something like this? $("#foo").append("<div>hello world</div>")
[20:14:00] <tintin> So how is it helpful/necessary? $("#foo").append("<div>hello world</div>")
[20:14:11] <tintin> because it doesn't create that div permanently
[20:14:22] <tintin> Then why does these methods exist?
[20:14:25] <ThrushAAX> with facebook comment it sends to the server AND does a .append
[20:14:41] <ThrushAAX> that way when the page is refreshed it loads all the data from the server
[20:15:41] <ThrushAAX> when you submit it comment it doesn't need to reload the whole page... it just uses .append() to update the comments
[20:15:52] <tintin> Does it append first then saves the data into database or does it save data into database server first then append the div on page? which is done first?
[20:16:42] <ThrushAAX> you can do either first... normally you try and send it to the server. if it sends OK then it append otherwise it should show an error message
[20:16:58] <ThrushAAX> normally send to server first
[20:17:19] <tintin> So it's done by $.ajax({ .. , right?
[20:17:26] <ThrushAAX> yeah
[20:17:53] <tintin> The appending part will be in success: function(prm) { .. , right?
[20:18:11] <ndss56> hi, what do you call the information that is passed back from server in an ajax call?
[20:18:11] <ThrushAAX> yep
[20:18:13] <tintin> Is it possible to do it using $.post({... ?
[20:18:46] <tintin> Can you pastebin a sample code using $.post or $.ajax to do this commenting-save and appending ?
[20:19:14] <ThrushAAX> $.ajax would probably be a better choice as it has both success and error callbacks
[20:19:19] <tintin> ndss56: response
[20:19:21] <ThrushAAX> sample code is in the documentation
[20:19:32] <jasonenglish> ndss56: you can name the argument anything you want
[20:19:48] <tintin> ThrushAAX: Does $.post have success: and error: callback?
[20:19:48] <ndss56> general name is?
[20:19:51] <coldhead> i will call her frances
[20:20:14] <jasonenglish> lol
[20:20:50] <bencahill> Hey guys, I've got a queer problem here...
[20:21:24] <bencahill> I've got a grid of images set up with inline-block and text-align:justfiy, which needs whitespace (e.g. line breaks) between the li's in my ul.
[20:21:49] <ThrushAAX> tintin: yeah, check the docs
[20:22:32] <bencahill> I'm using the quicksand plugin, but when it clones the original ul and insertBefore's it into the DOM, there is no whitespace between the li's (i.e. </li><li>), so it breaks my layout.
[20:22:44] <bencahill> Is there any way to force whitespace between inserted elements?
[20:22:46] <tintin> ThrushAAX: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[20:22:55] <ndss56> coldhead: hi, how to check if the ajax call was successful or not?
[20:22:57] <tintin> ThrushAAX: But it doesn't have error callback, has it?
[20:26:24] <coldhead> depends how you define, success, ndss56
[20:26:47] <coldhead> if no data is returned the success handler won't run
[20:26:52] <coldhead> and the error handler may
[20:27:02] <coldhead> so you can separate your code into those 2 guys
[20:27:23] <coldhead> otherwise if it's returning successfully something like data.status = "something failed"
[20:27:29] <coldhead> you can test for that in the success handler
[20:29:43] <ndss56> coldhead: the data i'm extracting from the server is of type "text". the server will always return text, empty text/string, in worst case scenario. So I suppose I would only need a success handler?
[20:30:02] <coldhead> that should suffice, yes
[20:30:13] <tintin> Does $.post have error callback?
[20:30:22] <coldhead> and i assume you examine the text to see what actually happened?
[20:30:37] <coldhead> data.match(/error/) or something
[20:30:54] <tintin> ThrushAAX: Hi
[20:30:55] <atno> morning

[20:31:31] <ndss56> coldhead: the text is just html code with data from the database. I wan't to catch if the html code has no data in it. Thats what I call unsuccessful.
[20:32:00] <tintin> Can the $.post be writen in $.ajax way ? for example $.post(url: .. , data:..., success:... ,);
[20:32:48] <ndss56> tintin: from memory $.post is just shorthand for $.ajax...
[20:33:21] <tintin> ndss56: But syntax doesn't look like $.ajax , http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[20:33:49] <ndss56> tintin: correct because its a shorthand version.
[20:34:10] <tintin> So can the $.post be writen in $.ajax way ? for example $.post(url: .. , data:..., success:... ,);
[20:34:45] <psyolus> Use method?
[20:35:03] <ndss56> tintin: not sure, but you can try it out. but if your writing in $.ajax way then use $.ajax instead...
[20:35:20] <tintin> Can anyone answer being sure?
[20:36:28] <johnkpaul> tintin: no, you cannot, if you need all of the options, use $.ajax
[20:36:52] <tintin> johnkpaul: Which option are you talking about?
[20:37:21] <johnkpaul> you cannot pass an object of options to $.post
[20:37:32] <tintin> Does $.post have error callback?
[20:37:55] <johnkpaul> tintin: not passed as a paramter
[20:38:09] <johnkpaul> $.post(url,data).fail(errorHandler)
[20:39:00] <tintin> johnkpaul: What is option for $.post? do you mean , url:, data:, success:, error:, are these options ?
[20:39:27] <johnkpaul> tintin: did you read the link that you sent earlier?
[20:39:29] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[20:39:37] <bencahill> WAHOO! Fixed with a little bit of .before(' ') magic!
[20:40:02] <johnkpaul> $.ajax takes a parameter that is an object with all of the possible options for an ajax call
[20:40:04] <johnkpaul> $.post does not
[20:40:20] <johnkpaul> if you want to add an error handler to a $.post, you need to use the mechanism that I said eariler
[20:41:32] <tintin> johnkpaul: I understand, but you said about "options" what did you mean by options?
[20:42:06] <johnkpaul> error is one of the options that you could pass in the parameter to $.ajax, but not $.post, because $.post does not take an options object
[20:44:04] <tintin> When we click the comment button in facebook, does it append the <div> of comment?
[20:44:25] <tintin> But how does this newly appended <div> get the value of that comment-form?
[20:44:53] <tintin> Does it take it from the database server? I mean, first saves the data into database, then take it from databse?
[20:45:33] <tintin> Or just saves into database, and take the data from form only, no need to fetch from connecting to database again
[20:45:46] <mparodi_> is it possible to create a SVG without restricted dimensions? I want it to be at position 100, 100 for example, but if the user drag its elements it must expands so that you don't hide any of them
[20:45:50] <tintin> What is the best way to debug jquery/javascript?
[20:45:58] <mparodi_> if you have any idea, I'm looking for one :)
[20:46:23] <tintin> What is the best way to debug jquery/javascript?
[20:46:41] <tintin> firebug?
[20:46:48] <tintin> Anything else but firebug?
[20:47:14] <mparodi_> what is wrong with it?
[20:47:18] <ibodi> can jq apply to iframe which is an external url ?
[20:53:12] <jasonenglish> ibodi: yes if its a domain you control, no if its not
[20:54:23] <jasonenglish> http://javascript.info/tutorial/same-origin-security-policy#example
[20:54:32] <jasonenglish> something to read up on
[20:54:38] <ibodi> thanks
[20:56:57] <ibodi> jasonenglish: actually i try to change font-size in iframe [url belong to someone else] -- so it will not work
[20:57:40] <jasonenglish> yup
[21:03:24] <ibodi> leave
[21:04:51] <coldhead> good work, ibodi
[21:49:21] <sonnie> hey. i met a compatible problem. dialog function  works fine under Firefox, but not under IE(conflict). see http://devel.lib.ustc.edu.cn/js1.html plz
[21:58:50] <sonnie> my stupid error..
[22:21:14] <DarkSector> How do I write to a text file using jQuery?
[22:22:06] <oojacoboo> DarkSector, where?
[22:22:13] <oojacoboo> jquery is client side
[22:22:15] <DarkSector> oojacoboo: in the same folder
[22:22:19] <DarkSector> oh
[22:22:26] <DarkSector> then that question doesn' tmake sense
[22:22:29] <DarkSector> I mean my question
[22:22:33] <oojacoboo> right
[22:23:11] <DarkSector> or maybe it does, hey wait, what if I were to click on a checkbox and that value be written on to a text file created in the same folder where the html page was, am I making sense oojacoboo
[22:23:31] <oojacoboo> DarkSector, nope
[22:23:43] <oojacoboo> javascript is executed client side
[22:23:49] <oojacoboo> your server has no clue
[22:29:31] <adjudicator> testing
[22:42:13] <Hereisanotherlie> DarkSector: you could write a value to a text file with jquery
[22:42:22] <DarkSector> Hereisanotherlie: Yes! that's what I wanted
[22:42:28] <DarkSector> Hereisanotherlie: how?
[22:42:36] <Hereisanotherlie> you would probably want to use ajax in conjunction with php though to make it simpler
[22:42:44] <Hereisanotherlie> it depends
[22:42:48] <DarkSector> Python
[22:42:48] <Hereisanotherlie> there are a lot of ways
[22:43:30] <tintin> For commenting system, how does the <div> populates data? where does it get the data? from database or from the comment-form?
[22:43:46] <tintin> Suppose i clicked the comment button, and there is a texbox above
[22:43:49] <Hereisanotherlie> you'll need to use some sort of server side language
[22:44:08] <Hereisanotherlie> you wouldn't be able to do it with only javascript though
[22:44:15] <tintin> Yes, that server side will save the data into database table, i know that
[22:44:23] <Hereisanotherlie> not you
[22:45:24] <tintin> $('idd').append('<div>'data</div>');
[22:45:34] <tintin> Where would it get the data to append that div?
[22:45:52] <tintin> Because after cliking it will append the div immediately
[22:46:25] <tintin> Any idea?
[22:46:32] <tintin> Can anyone answer?
[22:47:57] <tintin> shoky: ?
[22:53:45] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: its right there
[22:53:55] <Hereisanotherlie> append to the id
[22:54:06] <Hereisanotherlie> whatever has that id
[22:54:10] <Hereisanotherlie> it doesn't have to be a div
[22:55:06] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: take a look at this http://tutsplus.com/lesson/creating-and-appending-content/
[22:59:13] <ndss56> hi, whats the syntax to insert a DOM after $(this)?
[23:00:13] <Hereisanotherlie> ndss56: where in the dom are you trying to insert something
[23:00:36] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: after $(this) object
[23:00:50] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: which is a button that user has clicked on.
[23:01:10] <Hereisanotherlie> you'll probably want to use .append() and .on(click)
[23:01:27] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: im guessing something like $(this).insert($html); ???
[23:03:20] <Hereisanotherlie> ndss56: it really depends
[23:04:31] <donkeycongo> Does selecting an option from a select-element trigger an event on that option? or does it only trigger events on the select?
[23:04:36] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: no worries. another question. how do i change a tags class?
[23:04:57] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: i mean change class attribute?
[23:05:05] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: do i delete the old and add a new?
[23:05:30] <josefig> I have a doubt, If I create some elements dynamically with ajax (input hidden elements with some values) If I do a simple post by a form normally these elements are not going to be posted normally? should I do it by an ajax call to post them all ?
[23:05:30] <Hereisanotherlie> ndss56: you could or you just add another class onto it
[23:05:53] <Hereisanotherlie> ndss56: you can have multiple classes on a single element
[23:06:11] <Hereisanotherlie> you'll be using .addClass() and .removeClass()
[23:06:23] <tintin> Hereisanotherlie: So it gets the data from that textbox id, ?
[23:06:42] <tintin> Hereisanotherlie: It doesn't go to the database to get that data?
[23:08:06] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: Most likely you won't need jquery to access your database just to append content
[23:09:05] <Hereisanotherlie> as long as the content is already in the dom you can easily add onto it
[23:10:34] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: why don't you link me your code using jsfiddle and i
[23:10:40] <Hereisanotherlie> ill see if i can help*
[23:12:26] <tintin> Hereisanotherlie: But next time when i would refresh/reload the page, it will bring/take the data from database and load the page, right?
[23:14:16] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: sure, you can use different id's or classes for the content and have the jquery affect only certain classes or id's
[23:15:07] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: How do i select the src attribute of an img tag?
[23:15:36] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: $('img').attr('src');?
[23:15:55] <Whirl3d> ndss56, that's the ticket.
[23:16:17] <ndss56> Whirl3d: :) i assume you mean I am right.
[23:16:25] <Hereisanotherlie> you got it
[23:16:28] <Whirl3d> sorry. Yes you are correct.
[23:17:46] <tintin> Is it possible to connect with database and take value from there using jquery?
[23:17:48] <ndss56> Whirl3d: right. next question is how i change the url in the scr from ...foo/foo.gif to foo/bar.gif?
[23:18:15] <systemfault> tintin: No, you need a server side language.
[23:18:28] <Hereisanotherlie> ndss56: $('#myDiv img').click(function() { $(this).attr('src', '/my/new/imgSrc.png'); });
[23:18:56] <tintin> So jquery can only get the value from the id or name of that html tag, right?
[23:19:31] <tintin> using selectors
[23:19:35] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: not bad except i don't know the img url so i need to select it and change the filename, which i do know.
[23:19:55] <Hereisanotherlie> you don't have to know the original url using that technique
[23:20:02] <Hereisanotherlie> just place it in a div
[23:20:06] <Hereisanotherlie> or add a class
[23:20:21] <systemfault> tintin: learn CSS and you will know.
[23:20:36] <tintin> I know CSS
[23:20:51] <tintin> Yes, i know jquery can take from id or class of that html tag
[23:20:57] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: the has same url but different filename
[23:20:58] <tintin> What's the difference between DOM and html tag?
[23:21:03] <tintin> What is DOM ?
[23:21:08] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: the images has same url but different filename
[23:21:39] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: i want a lazy way to selecting the url and changing the filename
[23:21:45] <systemfault> tintin: The Document Object Model, it's the browser internal representation of the parsed HTML.
[23:22:04] <ndss56> Hereisanotherlie: so manipulating the src and changing the filename
[23:23:37] <ndss56> i guess i need some sort of string manipulation to change src from foo/foo.gif to foo/bar.gif
[23:24:41] <tintin> So when a div is appended with a value it just takes the value from textbox and appended the div with that value, it doesn't bother to take the value from database as jquery can't connect with database, am i right?
[23:24:58] <tintin> Suppose typing in a textbox you clicked the comment button
[23:25:29] <ndss56> tintin: yeah u can do that with jquery
[23:25:46] <tintin> ndss56: I can do that what?
[23:25:53] <tintin> ndss56: I can do what?
[23:26:54] <tintin> ndss56: Can i connect with database using jquery?
[23:27:12] <ndss56> tintin: no
[23:27:25] <coldhead> you can connect to a URL that connects to a DB for you!
[23:27:33] <ndss56> tintin: but you can use jquery to capture user input
[23:27:36] <coldhead> but JS no speakada SQL
[23:27:58] <tintin> ndss56: Capture the input through which?
[23:28:05] <tintin> ndss56: How to capture the input?
[23:28:20] <ndss56> tintin: like in a form.
[23:28:36] <ndss56> tintin: google jquery form
[23:29:11] <ndss56> coldhead:  how do i change src attribute from foo/foo.gif to foo/bar.gif?
[23:29:18] <tintin> So it will get the form data using the id or class selector of that form , is that what you are saying?
[23:29:20] <tintin> ndss56: ^
[23:29:37] <ndss56> tintin: yes
[23:30:21] <ndss56> coldhead: without hardcoding the url
[23:30:46] <coldhead> you mean like .replace(/foo/, 'bar') ?
[23:31:15] <ndss56> coldhead: that might do it :) lets see
[23:31:28] <tintin> My question was/is: Typing something in textbox when we click the comment button in facebook, it appends a div after the last comment div with that data, question is: does it get the data from that id/class of that textbox or after saving the data into table jquery again contact with database to get the value from database?
[23:33:41] <tintin> So when jquery appends the div with comment data it just takes/gets the comment-data from the textbox-id/class, am i right?
[23:33:56] <tintin> So the appending comment div is a temporal issue, right?
[23:34:30] <tintin> Can anyone answer?
[23:35:50] <ndss56> coldhead: is that a javascript function? replace()?
[23:36:17] <coldhead> it's a string method
[23:36:29] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[23:36:39] <ndss56> coldhead: $img_icon.('src').replace(/comment_new.gif,'comment.gif'); <-- giving me a script error
[23:36:53] <Hereisanotherlie> is that the same as .replaceWith() ?
[23:37:29] <coldhead> it should be $img_icon.attr('src')
[23:37:35] <coldhead> and you can't edit attr() in place
[23:37:48] <coldhead> you have to save the result to a var and then set it again with another call to attr()
[23:38:22] <coldhead> var o = thing.attr('src'); thing.attr('src', o.replace(...))
[23:38:26] <coldhead> capiche?
[23:38:59] <coldhead> Hereisanotherlie: replacewith is jQ for DOM elements, this is JS for strings
[23:40:18] <Hereisanotherlie> oh I see, I'm learning it backwards
[23:40:23] <Hereisanotherlie> jq -> js
[23:40:50] <Hereisanotherlie> it actually seems to be easier for me this way. I tried jumping into javascript alone in the past to no avail
[23:41:28] <coldhead> it was the same with me, Hereisanotherlie
[23:41:36] <coldhead> jQ is a nice life raft to cling to
[23:41:43] <coldhead> naked JS is terrifying
[23:42:16] <Hereisanotherlie> it's a bit easier now that I understand just what it can do and it's limitations
[23:42:38] <Hereisanotherlie> and the ways you can extend vanilla js with libraries and stuff
[23:43:40] <coldhead> right
[23:45:00] <tintin> Can anyone answer my question?
[23:45:04] <systemfault> JS is easyâ¦ DOM is hell. DOM is where jQuery really helps
[23:45:21] <ndss56> coldhead: cheers bro
[23:45:35] <tintin> When some html tag for example a div is appended, it is appended temporarily?
[23:45:46] <blackspotwiggins> no
[23:45:56] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: What do you mean?
[23:46:18] <blackspotwiggins> i mean it is not temporary
[23:46:24] <blackspotwiggins> you asked a yes/no question
[23:46:48] <tintin> Why/how is it not temporary?
[23:46:55] <tintin> Please explain your answer
[23:47:02] <blackspotwiggins> i may have made a mistake here tho - temporary can mean so many things
[23:47:14] <blackspotwiggins> it is not magically written to server html source if thats what you mean
[23:47:29] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: If you reload/refresh the webpage would you get that newly appended div there?
[23:47:34] <blackspotwiggins> no
[23:47:46] <tintin> Then how is it not temporary?
[23:48:17] <blackspotwiggins> in the scope of current session, it doesnt disappear
[23:48:20] <blackspotwiggins> unless you remove it
[23:48:47] <tintin> I'm talking about refresh/reload
[23:48:48] <blackspotwiggins> i assumed that you would understand that _clientside_ scripting does not automatically make any changes on the server
[23:49:38] <blackspotwiggins> but hey, assume nothing on #jquery
[23:49:49] <tintin> So is it the same policy for facebook comment appending div too? Is facebook comment appending div temporal too?
[23:49:50] <jasonenglish> he asked these questions earlier
[23:50:11] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, most probably facebook stores that comment in a database
[23:50:36] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: Yes, facebook stores that in database so you can get that div after refresh/reload
[23:51:08] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: But my question is for the first time when the div is appended in faceoobk and you didn't refresh/reload that page, so is it temporal div too?
[23:52:14] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, i dont understand what you are asking
[23:52:27] <systemfault> Nobody does :P
[23:52:33] <Hereisanotherlie> systemfault: +1
[23:52:57] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: Did you understand the definition of temporal i meant?
[23:53:03] <jasonenglish> he's asked these questions multiple times
[23:53:21] <tintin> temporary = you appended something, but after reload that page that will be gone
[23:53:34] <blackspotwiggins> ok, lets work with that
[23:54:03] <blackspotwiggins> usually when you add a comment in facebook, the info also gets to the server
[23:54:11] <blackspotwiggins> but there is always a possibility of failure
[23:54:18] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: Just forget about server
[23:54:29] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: forget about saving the data into database
[23:54:47] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: think that facebook won't/doesn't save the comment into database table
[23:54:55] <gnarf> wow wallotext
[23:55:04] <gnarf> coldhead: are you following any of this?
[23:55:09] <blackspotwiggins> ok then, everything is temporary then :)
[23:55:12] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: So if i reload/refresh the page will the newly appended div be gone?
[23:55:24] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: That's the answer,
[23:55:27] <gnarf> tintin: did you store it in local storage?
[23:55:31] <blackspotwiggins> oyea
[23:55:35] <blackspotwiggins> localstore is a possiblity
[23:55:45] <gnarf> google lscache
[23:55:45] <tintin> What is localstore?
[23:55:49] <gnarf> pamela fox plugin
[23:56:06] <gnarf> https://github.com/pamelafox/lscache
[23:56:27] <blackspotwiggins> ehh, backbone with localstore backend
[23:56:37] <gnarf> works too
[23:56:40] <systemfault> Pamela Fox sounds like a pr0nstar name
[23:57:00] <tw2113> it's mine :O
[23:57:03] <tintin> systemfault: Which pronstar?
[23:57:09] <gnarf> i haven't used backbone yet
[23:57:12] <gnarf> and that makes me sad
[23:57:30] <gnarf> too busy writing my own library
[23:57:48] <systemfault> gnarf: Why do you do that if backbone exists? :P
[23:58:00] <systemfault> Or even ember.. knockout.. etc..
[23:58:04] <tintin> Suppose you are not storing data anywhere, not in local store or in database or in any file or in memory, data is not saved
[23:58:10] <tintin> gnarf: ^
[23:58:21] <gnarf> of course not
[23:58:32] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: how many times do you need to ask that
[23:58:35] <tintin> gnarf: 'of course not' for what?
[23:58:38] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, if you dont store data, you cant even see it
[23:58:44] <blackspotwiggins> thats not how computers work
[23:58:54] <gnarf> all "var"s and functions are destroyed on page unload
[23:59:11] <gnarf> you could maybe use a hash url
[23:59:14] <gnarf> or a cookie
[23:59:17] <gnarf> or a server
[23:59:18] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: Hereisanotherlie That's my point, so every creation of html tag by jquery/javascript is a temporary process
[23:59:36] <gnarf> tintin: stop arguing semantics
[23:59:53] <gnarf> most developers of web applications assume that the whole page is unloaded from memory when navigation occurs
