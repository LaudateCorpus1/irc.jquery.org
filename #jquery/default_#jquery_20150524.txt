[00:52:39] <VectorX> hi so in this slider Nivo, if the image has a title it shows up as a caption, i have added a data-heading to the first image and want that to show as a <H1> on top of the image using seperate JS, how can this be down ? http://jsfiddle.net/xg9nhzdv/1/
[01:20:59] <jrgill> Anyone familiar with jqGrid?  I'm just a user working with a server on version 2.0.  Currently there's too much data in one field.  I'm trying to query in a way that excludes a character but still ends with a string containing this character.
[02:07:06] <Pintofbeer> I posted this to javascript but sorry, this is probably the better place.  Sorry  Really curious why the input#delete-data section stops of the datatables loading.  I cannot see any syntax errors but am a newbie and also need to improve my debugging skills.  Also, the "click" function isn't working but guess that is step 2 to fix.  Here is the code.  http://pastebin.com/dAztFZU3
[03:12:31] <titii> I have a button type submit with classic onclick - return prompt... it is native behavior - to submit or not. And ... is it possible to make custom prompt / modal window with onclick return - from my modal window to return false or true? or how can i do that?
[04:14:05] <m1ga> hi, i have a question about .load(). Not sure if my case will work: i have a page "grid.html" with a div (class rows). in my main page I can load the grid.html by clicking on an element (working fine, loaded into div#overlay). but now I want to load anothre grid.html from this #overlay. Now I get conflicts because I have multiple div.rows and I don't know how to access only the 2nd div.rows
[04:47:50] <dimi1947> can a cllick handler be attached to a div element that contains only text?
[04:49:04] <arc_> yes
[04:49:40] <dimi1947> take a look this fiddle..https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/
[04:49:42] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/
[04:50:11] <dimi1947> click the add div below the from input box on Monday
[04:51:23] <dimi1947> the click handler is at line 18-all of these is backbone code
[04:51:34] <dimi1947> the handler does not work though
[04:51:56] <arc_> you're missing an open curly brace on line 29
[04:52:17] <arc_> it works now
[04:53:47] <dimi1947> thanks
[04:53:53] <arc_> np
[07:39:46] <[non]> why http://pastebin.com/cjssksEF this code sometimes just doesnt work. even in debug. Sometimes when i click login-btn it just acting like there is no manipulation for it.
[09:07:42] <hassoon> shouldn't mastering the six first parts of the try.jquery's course program enough for me to understand using jquery with a mysql DB easily ?
[09:08:06] <hassoon> so i make my forms send data on the fly without reloading the page or something
[09:35:11] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help 'clicking' an input when a select field option is selected. I just can't get the 'click' to happen: http://jsfiddle.net/umvfuabr/
[09:35:33] <ashgotti> My condition works, just not the trigger part
[09:37:51] <shoky> ashgotti: your selector for the <select> is wrong
[09:38:14] <ashgotti> shoky: Hm.. really? If I alert in that it does work when "Spouse Included" is selected
[09:38:34] <shoky> ashgotti: not in the fiddle
[09:39:03] <ashgotti> oh ya..look at that, it doesn't
[09:39:49] <ashgotti> shoky: works now. The whole thing works..hmm don't know why it doesn't work on my site http://jsfiddle.net/umvfuabr/1/
[09:40:27] <ashgotti> Ah, looks like it's because the button uses an ajax call: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8152782/simulating-the-add-another-item-ajax-call-in-drupal-7-using-jquery
[09:41:46] <ashgotti> had to use trigger('mousedown').
[09:42:24] <shoky> best to just call a function instead of triggering fake events
[09:42:49] <ashgotti> shoky: Yup, unfortunately I have to work with Drupal's framework so I'm a bit limited.
[09:43:01] <shoky> eek
[09:43:19] <ashgotti> I love Drupal but I spend 90% of my time working on simple things
[09:59:59] <vivekananda> ashgotti, are you new with drupal
[10:00:24] <vivekananda> I am going to be too hoping I could find someone who could gimme a few pointers or work with :)
[10:07:22] <Uhkis> just ask here or #drupal
[10:08:11] <tuxblackedo> hey so i got a div that refreshes every second, is there any way i can store the page in a variable and only make it refresh the div on new data? this is where i am at right now -> http://pastebin.com/GHPcFMwq
[10:08:26] <tuxblackedo> i know this is like a beginner/basic question....
[10:10:09] <Palmer11> so you want jquery to load your pages?
[10:10:35] <tuxblackedo> load my div yeah
[10:10:50] <tuxblackedo> i just dont want it to reload the div if the data is identical
[10:12:52] <Palmer11> what is the data? and why is it refreshing every 1 second?
[10:13:08] <tuxblackedo> the data is just output from something else
[10:13:28] <tuxblackedo> it is refreshing every second because the data changes, but it doesnt change every second
[10:14:04] <tuxblackedo> but the data is just stuff out of a text file that changes every so often
[10:15:20] <Palmer11> well, if the text file is always being refreshed/reloaded, then setting the unchanged data isn’t the problem
[10:16:16] <tuxblackedo> the text file has data in it that sometimes is identical to the previous load
[10:16:41] <tuxblackedo> i just dont want it to call the load function when the div already contains the same data that is in the text file
[10:16:58] <Palmer11> ok, but the data has already been loaded. So setting it to the same value, wouldn’t really effect anything.
[10:17:15] <Palmer11> well, you can just do a simple if check
[10:17:22] <Palmer11> to prevent a load from taking place
[10:18:08] <tuxblackedo> i wanna do a simple check because sometimes i need to copy and paste things (in the browser) and when you call .load containing the same data it unselects whatever text you are trying to select in the browser
[10:18:19] <tuxblackedo> how do i do a check?
[10:18:37] <Palmer11> if($new != $old) $new = $old;
[10:18:51] <tuxblackedo> yeah but how do i load a page into a vairable
[10:19:11] <Palmer11> … you shouldn’t compare an entire page
[10:19:20] <ashgotti> vivekananda: no, I'm not new. Certified developer.
[10:19:35] <Palmer11> certified? lol wat?
[10:19:49] <ashgotti> vivekananda: youtube some of the drupalcon talks, it'll give you a good overview of drupal and it's framework
[10:19:54] <ashgotti> *its
[10:20:04] <tuxblackedo> I was thinking i need another (hidden?) div that i am loading the data into to compare against the div that is in the displayed div?
[10:20:58] <tuxblackedo> and then i can do if($('.hiddendiv').html==$('.showndiv').html){ $('.hiddendiv').html=$('.showndiv').html
[10:21:07] <tuxblackedo> does that seem like the way to do it?
[10:22:01] <Palmer11> uhh… well the confusing part is, you are loading the page, to check if the page has changed, to prevent loading the page? But the page has already been loaded?
[10:23:09] <tuxblackedo> or is there a way to load a page into a variable without making another div?
[10:23:29] <tuxblackedo> Palmer11: the page changes
[10:23:43] <tuxblackedo> the page i am loading changes every now and then
[10:24:03] <Palmer11> yes, but you are loading the page to check if the page has new data.
[10:24:11] <tuxblackedo> yes
[10:24:15] <Palmer11> .....
[10:24:17] <tuxblackedo> and if it does then update the page
[10:24:22] <Palmer11> then just display it. You have already loaded the page
[10:24:43] <tuxblackedo> but i dont want it to load if the page is identical to what it was before
[10:24:48] <Palmer11> you are still loading the page. not displaying it is just unused data
[10:25:02] <tuxblackedo> i am fine with that
[10:25:13] <Palmer11> then you are doing it all wrong
[10:25:47] <tuxblackedo> how would i do it right?
[10:26:26] <tuxblackedo> i want the that browser load the entire remote file so that it can check the contents against the locally stored variable
[10:30:38] <Palmer11> so you should be passing the data that needs updated through that
[10:31:14] <Palmer11> I hope this data isn’t important
[10:42:07] <glowdemon1> Welp, so my first attempt at jquery shows a blank field, http://pastebin.com/DmnMHR0a is there anything wrong with this on first sight?
[10:42:33] <tuxblackedo> its not important
[10:42:43] <glowdemon1> I mean, a blank page
[10:45:17] <deadd0g> glowdemon1: is that the entire contents of your page?
[10:45:29] <glowdemon1> Just a bit
[10:46:04] <cod3munk> How can I check a form for a submit listener with on('submit')?
[10:46:20] <deadd0g> i mean without even getting to the script, the script tag is broken, but im not sure if youve just pasted it weirdly
[10:46:23] <cod3munk> ie. I want to see if the form has a listener on it already.
[10:47:22] <Palmer11> cod3munk, why not $(form).submit(function(e) { … }
[10:48:29] <Palmer11> cod3munk, http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/debug-jquery-events-with-listhandlers/
[10:48:51] <cod3munk> is that pretty much the same as .on?
[10:48:59] <cod3munk> .on('submit' that is
[10:49:00] <Palmer11> yes
[10:49:10] <Palmer11> it just checks the form submit
[10:49:22] <cod3munk> ok I can use that. But what I'm asking is how I see if that even is bound or not.
[10:49:59] <cod3munk> if ($form has submit event) { }
[10:50:07] <glowdemon1> https://jsfiddle.net/8ccj56ha/ is my full code
[10:51:15] <glowdemon1> I just wanted to replace the visibility at line 44+ into a slideUp
[10:51:17] <cod3munk> $form.data('events') seems like it should work, but its giving me 'undefined'
[10:51:18] <Palmer11> first problem, is you are doing css inside js
[10:51:58] <glowdemon1> Is that bad?
[10:52:05] <Palmer11> and glowdemon, your syntax is broken
[10:52:14] <Palmer11> yes. You shouldn’t ever style through js
[10:52:23] <Palmer11> its why you have css files
[10:52:38] <glowdemon1> Yeah, but its meant to change colour when clicked on
[10:52:42] <Palmer11> ..
[10:52:50] <Palmer11> then add/remove a class
[10:52:51] <glowdemon1> I couldnt find another way around it
[10:52:56] <glowdemon1> mh alright
[10:53:07] <Palmer11> all styling should be done in your .css
[10:53:22] <Palmer11> if you need to apply/remove a style. Then remove the class from the element
[10:53:25] <Palmer11> or apply it
[10:56:01] <cod3munk> oh weird, data('events') is deprecated now. I have to use $._data($form[0], "events")); to get them. Wonder why that direct access is gone.
[11:42:42] <hassoon> why isn't bootstrap3 working properly with my jquery.min.js file being mentioned in the head
[11:42:52] <hassoon> but when using the jquery found in the CDN, the code works
[11:44:07] <arthurvr> hassoon: is the local version another version maybe?
[11:44:15] <arthurvr> hassoon: you sure it doesn’t 404 (check console)
[11:46:05] <Uhkis> cod3munk: i guess because it would conflict with getting value from data-events named attribute
[11:46:33] <hassoon> arthurvr: the problem that i experience with the downloaded jquery.js file, is the absence of drop-down menus that are supposed to appear in a tabbed <ul>
[11:46:48] <arthurvr> hassoon: do you see anything in the console?
[11:47:18] <hassoon> arthurvr: d'oh, what console?
[11:47:52] <arthurvr> hassoon: in your browser’s devtools :) first thing you should look at when debugging things, bro :) https://vimeo.com/25698808
[11:48:07] <hassoon> ah
[11:48:15] <hassoon> i run chromium/FF anyway
[11:51:17] <Shadow> Hi, how can I get this to fire when a checkbox is checked or unchecked. http://jsfiddle.net/p89ka9jq/21/
[11:52:17] <hassoon> ow boy..
[11:52:22] <hassoon> a long video
[11:53:31] <arthurvr> hassoon: watch it one day if you have time. Things like chrome devtools help you debug this kind of things faster than you’ve ever done
[11:54:22] <hassoon> arthurvr: nah, there is the ctrl+shift+j in chrome to display the console
[11:58:57] <Shadow> Can anyone help with my above question please.
[12:44:45] <wfq> Hi all
[12:45:09] <wfq> what is wrong with this please?  jQuery ('#userForm').validate ( { ignore: "#is_accept_policies" });
[12:46:19] <wfq> 'is_accept_policies exists.  The form was initialized with a validation object in which the ignore attribute was empty but now I am overriding it, Am I not?
[12:48:54] <wfq> any idea?
[12:53:53] <wfq> the f**** ignore gets ignore
[12:53:56] <wfq> *ignored
[12:54:05] <bepolite> lol
[12:56:15] <wfq> Not a single clue why this works: jQuery("#userForm").validate().settings.ignore = "*";
[13:01:17] <shoky> wfq: because .validate() returns the existing validator instance
[13:33:03] <jak2000> Anyone can recommend me a jquery datetimepicker plugin for capture date and time?
[15:09:40] <glowdemon1>         $('#registerfield').slideUp(500).toggleClass('invisible'); is this legit? (adding multiple functions to one element)
[15:10:53] <FreddyFlatFoot> Hi - is there a jQuery func to do what JavaScript .apply() or .call() does, but as shorthand without requiring an anonymous function?
[15:11:31] <FreddyFlatFoot> I feel like I saw one, but can't find it.  Maybe in underscore.js or something?
[15:13:38] <FreddyFlatFoot> I may have been thinking of this:  http://underscorejs.org/#bind
[15:13:57] <shoky> `api jQuery.proxy
[15:14:13] <shoky> there's also http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[15:14:36] <shoky> but neither .apply or .call require an anonymous function
[15:18:24] <FreddyFlatFoot> I mean anon func in the sense that both .apply and .call actually execute the wrapped function immediately, so if you're passing it as an event handler, you'd need to wrap it in an anon func
[15:18:56] <FreddyFlatFoot> Looks like $.proxy is what I was remembering.  It's similar to _.bind?
[15:41:04] <shoky> FreddyFlatFoot: yeah. and plain js also has .bind already https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind
[15:42:36] <FreddyFlatFoot> shoky: ha, thanks, I think that's the simplest answer that addresses what I'm after!
[15:43:04] <FreddyFlatFoot> Half a year away from JS and I've unlearned everything I ever knew :)
[15:43:11] <shoky> ;p

[18:47:42] <Talow> Hello. I have a select element that contains number values. I have a list that has a data-role that is a comma seperated list. I want to use a change function on the select to filter the unordered list, with the idea that the data-role should contain the value of the selected list when changed
[18:49:29] <Talow> assuming I have the change function being fired when the select changes and have received it's value as well as the ul element how would I hide the elements that do not contain the value of the select?
[18:52:14] <Talow> http://67.255.78.146/cf/node/14/floor-manager   http://67.255.78.146/cf/sites/all/modules/floor_manager/floor_manager_assignment.js

[20:18:20] <VectorX> is there a element resize event ?

[21:25:08] <tsukare> I have a really basis script http://pastebin.com/qftDwSuk  My page contains: <input id="deleteData" type="button" value="Submit"/> but when I click Submit there is no alert box.  This is driving me crazy because it is a simple example but cannot get it to work,  Any help appreciated.
[21:26:58] <tsukare> Is my syntax wrong?  When I type deleteData into the console, the button is found.
[21:28:43] <tsukare> Any way else to debug this?
[21:32:55] <tsukare> If I paste that code to the console, should it run?
[22:45:09] <grewalkamal> Hi I have 3 text editable input fields in a pop up. The data by default in second and third field is correct. It has been set up via some form at another page. But the value in the first text input field is coming up to be       "     <option value="1"> Kamalpreet          </option>"  I have used html() function.
[22:53:37] <Anoniem4l> Hello. How is it possible to get the first child element by a specific tagName?
[22:55:55] <dimi1947> is there another way besides a class an ID that en HTML element can be identified....
[22:57:37] <dimi1947> my problem is that I want to classify some elements and as I see this mean refactoring class/ID names....something undesirable
[23:07:08] <goodenough> maybe targeting their data attributes
[23:07:49] <goodenough> $("[data-group='Companies']")
[23:12:48] <dimi1947> yes...maybe this the solution I am searching
[23:38:25] <jak2000> hi all
[23:38:48] <toomus> Hi. Why when I try to update data attriute with data('some_key', 'new_value'), in DOM value doesn't change?
[23:39:04] <jak2000> anyone know how to show a window modal to user, and ask some values? Edit values from a Html Table, thanks
[23:39:11] <Cork> toomus: cause .data works with a cache, not the attributes
[23:39:29] <Cork> toomus: the cache gets populated based on data attributes if empty
[23:39:34] <jak2000> Cork any advice for me?
[23:40:01] <Cork> jak2000: there isn't a way to show a modal window
[23:40:14] <toomus> Cork: so I should use regular ID attribute instead?
[23:40:14] <Cork> that was removed from the web spec many many years ago
[23:40:32] <Cork> toomus: no, if you have to update the attribute use .attr not .data
[23:40:44] <Cork> toomus: though normally you don't need the dom to change
[23:40:46] <toomus> Cork: OK
[23:41:13] <Cork> jak2000: the closest you can get is styling elements in the page to look like a window/dialog
[23:41:26] <Cork> jak2000: and make that the only accessable element on the page
[23:41:39] <jak2000> any url for learn?
[23:42:02] <Cork> jak2000: https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[23:42:25] <toomus> Cork: Yes, but I have some edge case.
[23:42:39] <Cork> toomus: cause yes, id/class should be used for selection
[23:42:45] <Cork> and data for extra information
[23:45:17] <lintguy> *yawn*
