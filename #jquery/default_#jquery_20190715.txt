[10:40:00] <iwkse> hi, I'm using the datapick from jqueryui, having some issue with localizing it. I've added the locale js related file but it keeps saying Cannot read property 'it' of undefined (regionalOptions is missing)
[10:40:09] <iwkse> I see a lang property instead
[10:55:20] <Cork> iwkse: where do you get the translation from?
[10:55:45] <Cork> cause as long as you use the matching version it should just work
[10:55:57] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/udw0k5rq/2/
[10:56:25] <Cork> (i embedded it in the script section cause i don't have an url endpoint)
[10:58:18] <iwkse> Cork: I fixed it, had to modify the translation file
[10:58:38] <Cork> iwkse: then you use an old translation file with a new ui
[10:59:03] <iwkse> Cork: yes that's possible. There it was referring to $.datepick when I have $.datepicker
[10:59:12] <iwkse> and regional instead of regionalOptions
[10:59:31] <iwkse> I have an odd behaviour though, when I select the date I have, 04/07/20192019
[10:59:35] <iwkse> the year is duplicated
[10:59:43] <iwkse> this seems to happen only with localization, testing more
[11:00:01] <Cork> hmm its never been called datepick
[11:00:28] <iwkse> mm ok
[11:00:49] <Cork> anyway you will find up to date localizers for 1.12.1 here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.12.1/ui/i18n
[11:01:13] <Cork> (don't use master as it might not match the version your using
[11:01:26] <iwkse> thanks, I will try that
[11:04:00] <iwkse> Cork: it works fine with that Git version, nice
[11:33:53] <hypertiger> if I have multi-tables and I want to ajax them every sec, what is better for performants?
[11:34:08] <hypertiger> 1. ajax everything in one
[11:34:29] <hypertiger> 2. create multi ajax function
[12:00:58] <taplar> hypertiger expecting requests to consistently finish within a second is a smell
[12:01:24] <taplar> various users are going to have various network lag that can cause delays in requests finishing
[12:02:20] <hypertiger> then what is best way to display data when the database is changed?
[12:02:41] <taplar> it depends.  what kind of server are you using?
[12:02:53] <taplar> (web) server
[12:03:06] <hypertiger> right now is local
[12:03:15] <taplar> tomcat, nodejs, etc.. ?
[12:03:23] <hypertiger> django
[12:04:24] <taplar> depending upon how important it is to be realtime, I would suggest researching implementing websockets with django

[12:04:57] <hypertiger> thx.
