[01:17:45] <jquery797> Hi, has anybody encountered before where with jquery ui running the cancel: 'selector' method/event cancels the event, but cancels all events for that selector?
[01:18:56] <jquery797> I'm wanting to allow sorting, but on anything but a certain child class, so I'm using the cancel: event/method to cancel sorting on that child class, but it appears it's cancelling all events for that child class? I can't scroll at all when my mouse is on that element
[01:18:59] <jquery797> Any ideas?
[01:38:48] <mindpattern> if i scroll down a page and want an element to ‘fade up’ how do i offset the height for the animation without effecting (pushing/pulling) the content below?
[02:36:33] <burtnein> Hi guys. Anyone with experience could lend me a hand in determining best tools for the job?
[02:36:55] <burtnein> I have a need to generate a dynamic n-ary tree in the web app.
[02:43:44] <bornCode> Hi all
[02:44:02] <bornCode> i need help in how to reload iframe in Popup
[02:44:52] <bornCode> I have a popup in which my images are displaynig
[02:45:08] <bornCode> and i want to reload my frame after popup open once only
[02:45:13] <bornCode> can anyone help me in this
[02:49:45] <bornCode> Hi anyone is there to help me
[02:49:46] <bornCode> ?/
[02:50:11] <slax0r> yes, remove the iframe
[02:50:28] <bornCode> i need iframe
[02:50:34] <bornCode> to zoom image on hover
[02:51:27] <bornCode> issue is, when i open my popup first time then image zoom on hover is not working
[02:51:54] <bornCode> but when i right click on image and reload frame then zoom is working fine
[02:52:17] <bornCode> so is there any way to reload iframe once after load complete
[02:57:20] <Cork> bornCode: is the iframe the same domain?
[02:57:30] <bornCode> yes
[02:57:55] <Cork> $('#iframe').contents().reload() should work if i remember correctly
[02:57:57] <Cork> opps
[02:58:02] <Cork> $('#iframe').contents()[0].reload() should work if i remember correctly
[02:58:14] <ctmarco> Hello i hav big problem with my jquery ui
[02:58:48] <bornCode> @cork: i want to reload it once only when document load ready
[02:58:52] <bornCode> is it possible ?/
[02:59:06] <Cork> document load ready??
[02:59:10] <bornCode> yes
[02:59:18] <Cork> that sentence makes no sense
[02:59:34] <Cork> document ready or document loaded sure
[02:59:52] <bornCode> means when i click on anchore tag, i am opening one popup
[03:00:10] <ctmarco> I have problem with jquery ui i have correct autocomplete code but it wont work
[03:00:22] <ctmarco> WHat problem might be what causes it?
[03:00:28] <Cork> ctmarco: make a jsfiddle.net showing the problem
[03:00:33] <bornCode> cork: so after load that popup , i want to reload one more time that popup
[03:00:49] <bornCode> <cork> without closing popup
[03:01:01] <Cork> bornCode: so you want to change the url of the iframe?
[03:01:09] <bornCode> so that my zoom image on hover functionality will work
[03:01:10] <Cork> or how exactly do you want to change the content of it?
[03:01:11] <bornCode> Yes
[03:01:18] <Cork> then do exactly that
[03:01:23] <bornCode> content is coming from another page
[03:02:22] <Cork> if the iframe isn't a loaded page (with an url) then you can't do what you want
[03:02:43] <Cork> (cause in that case the content is generated from javascript, and the only way to "reload it" is to run that script again)
[03:03:11] <bornCode> okay, i will try thanks
[03:03:17] <bornCode> okay, i will try, thanks
[03:03:25] <ctmarco> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/92w42bvc/
[03:07:10] <ctmarco> Cork: Sorry i upadated code little bit with input field
[03:07:15] <ctmarco> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/92w42bvc/1/
[03:07:23] <Cork> ctmarco: no prob give me a min
[03:08:04] <Cork> ctmarco: https://jsfiddle.net/92w42bvc/2/
[03:08:28] <Cork> make sure the resources exists (the ui and css file)
[03:08:38] <Cork> and also make sure autocomplete is part of the bundle you use
[03:10:36] <ctmarco> Cork How i can make check code?
[03:10:42] <ctmarco> For autocomplete function
[03:10:55] <ctmarco> How i might check if it exists ?
[03:10:57] <Cork> check code?
[03:11:05] <Cork> $.ui.autocomplete
[03:11:08] <ctmarco> Cheking if autocomplete exists
[03:11:11] <ctmarco> ok
[03:11:16] <Cork> if that is undefined you don't have it
[03:11:26] <Cork> id $ is undefined you haven't loaded jquery
[03:11:49] <Cork> and if $.ui is undefiend you haven't loaded jquery-ui
[03:15:26] <ctmarco> How to open console where console.log function writes something?:D
[03:15:33] <ctmarco> In chrome
[03:17:16] <Cork> you have to open it your self
[03:17:24] <Cork> you can't automate it (as far as i know)
[03:23:52] <ctmarco> Cork: It not work )=
[03:24:43] <Cork> ctmarco: well then you have to figure out what you do differently
[03:24:58] <ctmarco> I included ui
[03:25:10] <ctmarco> All is included but my script not working )=
[03:25:10] <Cork> and no errors in the network tab?
[03:25:16] <ctmarco> yes
[03:25:36] <Cork> hmm
[03:25:56] <Cork> $('[id="emailInput"]').length is?
[03:26:43] <ctmarco> I dont know )=
[03:26:51] <Cork> uh... you don't know??
[03:28:21] <ctmarco> Cork: console.log("My text"); also not printing in console, i opened console
[03:28:49] <Cork> sounds like your scripts aren't included at all
[03:29:15] <ctmarco> But script scroller works
[03:29:34] <ctmarco> I comented script out and make console.log("My text");
[03:29:43] <ctmarco> But it not print in console
[03:30:24] <Cork> and you have the console open before you load the page?
[03:31:06] <ctmarco> yes
[03:31:35] <Cork> well can't really help you much then
[03:34:39] <ctmarco> Cork: console prints error
[03:35:04] <ctmarco> Cork Query.Deferred exception: $(...).autocomplete is not a function TypeError: $(...).autocomplete is not a function
[03:35:33] <Cork> so autocomplete isn't part of the jquery-ui bundle, or you haven't loaded jquery-ui like i said before
[03:35:50] <ctmarco> Cork How i can load correct bundle
[03:36:07] <Cork> uh, depends on where you got the one your using from
[03:37:01] <ctmarco> I using it for autocomplete
[03:37:33] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/download/
[03:55:36] <ctmarco> Cork i downloaded included
[03:55:45] <ctmarco> Cork: function is there inside
[03:55:56] <ctmarco> Cork: But i get error function not defined
[03:55:57] <ctmarco> )=
[03:56:14] <Cork> you need to load it in the page too
[03:56:25] <Cork> and you need to do it after loading jquery

[04:01:59] <PhpNoob> select option
[04:02:05] <PhpNoob> change value
[04:02:12] <Cork> also cleaned up https://jsfiddle.net/s89yu7y3/1/

[04:02:56] <PhpNoob> its work for h1 i want to use select option
[04:02:58] <PhpNoob> change value
[04:03:08] <Cork> ... -_-'
[04:03:29] <Cork> that sentence isn't descriptive enough

[04:04:07] <PhpNoob> <select><option value=""> </option> </select> thats
[04:04:37] <Cork> there is no select in that page
[04:04:48] <PhpNoob> yes can you show me how
[04:19:41] <MOUD> Hey all
[04:22:11] <MOUD> I have a newsletter form with 2 functions. One checks if the email is valid. The other sends the request to a php file. The problem is: If the email is invalid it also sends the request to the other php file. How can I fix so that it won't send unless the email is valid? http://pastebin.com/VYgU3FP7
[04:23:57] <Cork> MOUD: please make a jsfiddle of that
[04:24:06] <MOUD> ok
[04:24:23] <jquery557> Hi guys, anybody has ideas on how to render that? https://i.imgur.com/J3RvoYT.png
[04:24:37] <Cork> MOUD: the html section in the jsfiddle should only be the the body part of the pastebin
[04:25:15] <Cork> MOUD: put the scripts in the script section and external dependencies in the external resources to the left
[04:25:23] <MOUD> Cork, ok
[04:26:33] <Cork> jquery557: what exactly are you asking?
[04:26:42] <Cork> cause 1+1 is always 2 so...
[04:26:58] <Cork> and render what?
[04:27:09] <jquery557> I want to build a tool that renders the proof tree like that on the screen.
[04:27:15] <jquery557> I have parser and evaluator already.
[04:27:21] <jquery557> But don't know how to display it "nicely"
[04:28:06] <Cork> if you want to render that exactly that would just be ul+li:s
[04:28:41] <jquery557> It is going to be dynamic expressions. It could be very long as well.
[04:28:48] <MOUD> https://jsfiddle.net/o4jam67x/
[04:29:03] <jquery557> https://i.imgur.com/Yui8MsG.png
[04:29:04] <Cork> jquery557: well if you want to render it as html that is what it would be
[04:29:11] <jquery557> But definitely not something large
[04:29:11] <MOUD> I'm not sure why it's not working on jsfiddle
[04:29:14] <jquery557> Larger
[04:30:02] <jquery557> By the way, here is an attempt: https://jsfiddle.net/vRb3P/
[04:30:03] <Cork> MOUD: ok, first, why don't you just use $.post instead of ajax_post?
[04:30:13] <jquery557> But it is horrible I think because of tables nightmare
[04:30:29] <Cork> jquery557: yes, use ul+li
[04:30:53] <jquery557> How would they be used exactly? I am new to front end and found this example on stack overflow question.
[04:31:17] <MOUD> Cork, I'm new to ajax, I was just following a tutorial on youtube and was working fine. The email validation came after.
[04:31:21] <Cork> jquery557: ul to wrap each |- section
[04:31:32] <Cork> jquery557: li to wrap each section you put border on
[04:31:43] <Cork> jquery557: css background the |- on the ul
[04:31:49] <Cork> and make li inline-block
[04:32:05] <Cork> and then nest the ul in the parent li
[04:32:12] <Cork> done (more or less)
[04:32:30] <Cork> you will have to have an exception for the li when the ul is the child
[04:34:11] <jquery557> Can you show me an example? For something simple like https://i.imgur.com/ffHSmUX.png
[04:40:55] <Cork> MOUD: what version of jquery are you using?
[04:41:24] <MOUD> Cork, jquery-3.1.1.min.js
[04:42:10] <MOUD> Cork, the validation works if it's the only script.
[04:42:44] <Cork> MOUD: https://jsfiddle.net/o4jam67x/1/
[04:42:50] <Cork> that should work
[04:43:01] <Cork> MOUD: also note you MUST also validate this in php
[04:43:12] <Cork> cause you can't depend on js validation
[04:43:18] <MOUD> Cork, ok
[04:43:43] <Cork> opps
[04:43:50] <Cork> missed to clean up some parts
[04:44:27] <ctmarco> Cork i tried but i need solve :D
[04:44:38] <ctmarco> jQuery.Deferred exception: $(...).autocomplete is not a function TypeError: $(...).autocomplete is not a function
[04:44:43] <ctmarco> This error makes ma crazy :D
[04:44:56] <Cork> ctmarco: you need to fix your script loading
[04:45:05] <Cork> when you've done that it will work
[04:45:15] <Cork> i can't help you more then that
[04:47:00] <MOUD> Cork, still doesn't work. Even if the email is invalid it will send the request.
[04:47:19] <Cork> MOUD: do the html modifications i made in the jsfiddle
[04:47:30] <Cork> but give me a min i want to make some more changes
[04:47:41] <MOUD> ok
[04:54:07] <ctmarco> Hello all anyone knows good exmaples where validation with possible chekc if validation fails do something?
[04:54:15] <ctmarco> I need code not plugin
[04:59:48] <Cork> MOUD: https://jsfiddle.net/o4jam67x/4/
[04:59:50] <Cork> there
[05:00:41] <Cork> MOUD: use class when you want to set a state on an element instead of css, cause then you can "reset" it when the state goes away
[05:00:59] <MOUD> Cork, ok
[05:01:12] <Cork> while if you use css() you have to know what state the element had before
[05:02:03] <Cork> MOUD: also if you are ok with requiring browser support for html validation
[05:02:11] <Cork> you can skip all the validation code here
[05:02:29] <MOUD> Cork, it's working perfectly, thank you very much
[05:03:06] <MOUD> Cork, I will leave as is for now. :)
[05:03:44] <Cork> MOUD: np, just make sure to read through the code so you understand what it does
[05:03:58] <Cork> your welcome to ask questions if you don't understand a part
[05:04:01] <MOUD> Cork, I'm doing it now.
[05:04:05] <MOUD> thanks
[05:04:45] <Cork> but it is important that you don't just copy & paste without understanding (cause then my writing the code was pointless)
[06:20:14] <ctmarco> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/oo9rmxr0/
[06:20:19] <ctmarco> What is wrong with this code?

[09:11:14] <arnas> hi
[09:11:21] <arnas> has anyone used jQuery UI's autocomplete?
[09:14:15] <arnas> http://pastebin.com/Qid3XWA5 I am getting this error (line 30) when I hover over on any of the items listed in the ul
[09:14:28] <arnas> if I delete _renderItem function, everything works
[09:16:57] <Cork> arnas: how _renderItem works for autocomplete has changed recently
[09:17:03] <Cork> you prob need to rewrite that function
[09:17:11] <arnas> Cork, I am using older version of jQuery ui
[09:18:12] <arnas> Cork, it's 1.11.4
[09:18:45] <Cork> arnas: i think it changed in 1.10, but not sure
[09:19:08] <Cork> i don't keep super good track of ui versions :/
[09:19:23] <arnas> Cork, where can I get an example of this new renderItem function?
[09:21:30] <Cork> arnas: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[09:21:51] <Cork> arnas: also if that doesn't help console.log item
[09:22:00] <Cork> it should give you what you actually get into the function
[09:25:27] <arnas> Cork, when I write it like this, _renderItem doesn't even get called
[09:26:16] <Cork> arnas: you set it on data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem ?
[09:26:37] <Cork> (on the input element)
[09:27:21] <arnas> Cork, http://pastebin.com/083KCqf2
[09:27:38] <Cork> it isn't an option
[09:28:00] <Cork> $("#searchPositionInput").autocomplete({}).data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem =
[09:28:48] <arnas> Cork, so how is it different from what I've had?
[09:29:06] <Cork> arnas: the variables has different values if i remember correctly
[09:29:21] <Cork> and it doesn't use <a> anymore
[09:29:47] <arnas> Cork, so maybe I don't need renderItem at all?
[09:30:01] <Cork> depends on what you added it for
[09:30:58] <arnas> Cork, this isn't my code, I am trying to fix it
[09:31:23] <arnas> Cork, I copy-pasted the code from the link u gave me and it still throws an error
[09:31:45] <Cork> arnas: add a console.log(item) in the function
[09:31:50] <Cork> and check what you get from it
[09:32:32] <arnas> Cork, a bunch of objects with label and value properties
[09:32:46] <Cork> and it still says value is undefined...
[09:32:57] <Cork> arnas: can you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle.net?
[09:33:02] <arnas> sure
[09:34:33] <arnas> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/12975/
[09:34:38] <arnas> it's giving a different error tho
[09:37:16] <jonah> Hi can anyone help. I've used this http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ with the Video popup instructions. It embeds and popups up and starts to play, but then stops as the player catches up with what is buffered or loaded too quickly. Does anyone know how I can please get this to stream and work properly? Do I need html5 video tags in there somehow?
[09:38:40] <Cork> arnas: hmm i get nothing from that code
[09:38:48] <arnas> Cork, what do you mean?
[09:38:56] <Cork> no errors or anyting...
[09:39:21] <arnas> Cork, enter "app" for example
[09:39:40] <Cork> ah...
[09:39:45] <Cork> weird...
[09:40:36] <Cork> ah, that isn't related to your problem
[09:40:53] <Cork> that is a compatibility problem between jquery-ui and jquery 3.1
[09:41:09] <Cork> i had to deal with that a few months ago so i remember that one...
[09:42:53] <arnas> Cork, my jQuery is 1.11.2
[09:43:15] <Cork> your using edge on jsfiddle
[09:44:43] <arnas> Cork, but I am using 1.11.2 on my page
[09:47:35] <arnas> Cork, so any ideas? Or do I have to write my own plugin for this? :D
[09:50:51] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, can you pls have a look at this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b5354bc6404fb2f42eb9938d77e772f7
[09:51:36] <naftilos76> How can i show the id of "left_arrow" inside the timer's anonymous function?
[09:52:05] <naftilos76> I did that once but i do not remember how i did it...
[09:52:41] <arnas> naftilos76, $(this) ?
[09:52:55] <arnas> oh, inside timer function
[09:53:00] <naftilos76> yep
[09:53:11] <arnas> naftilos76, well,  save this to a var outside that function or use arrow function
[09:53:12] <naftilos76> there is not 'this' in there
[09:55:15] <naftilos76> arnas, there is another way. There is got to be a way to pass this inside the timer's function
[09:55:30] <arnas> naftilos76, I just told you two different ways?
[09:56:26] <naftilos76> arnas, thanks but i do not like them.
[09:56:42] <arnas> naftilos76, that's your problem, these are the only two proper ways to accomplish that
[09:56:58] <brief> can anybody give me a hint how to implement jquery datatables with an array of objects? https://jsfiddle.net/n96curhg/4/
[09:57:08] <naftilos76> thanks arnas
[09:57:31] <arnas> naftilos76, this.counterId = function(self) { window.setInterval(function(){}, 500) } (this);
[09:57:40] <arnas> naftilos76, the last way I can think of, but that's kind of retarded
[09:58:01] <naftilos76> that is the right way
[09:58:55] <naftilos76> or would be if it worked...
[10:00:00] <arnas> naftilos76, no, that's the last way any decent developer would use
[10:04:23] <Cork> arnas: not without actually reproducing the error you get no
[10:04:38] <naftilos76> arnas, it just doesn't feel right to use a var defined outside a func even though it is valid in js. I finally had to define a var e to save this inside the first anon func and use it in the timer's func.
[10:05:01] <arnas> naftilos76, so use arrow function?..
[10:05:26] <naftilos76> that i do not know how
[10:05:35] <arnas> naftilos76, how can you know what's wrong and what's right, when you don't even know the basics of JS?
[10:05:56] <naftilos76> what do you mean by arrow func?
[10:06:29] <arnas> naftilos76, arrow function
[10:06:51] <naftilos76> well i do not know that
[10:07:34] <naftilos76> let me google it
[10:08:23] <Cork> naftilos76: its a new way to define function in es6
[10:08:32] <Cork> it isn't really safe to use in browsers yet
[10:08:52] <Cork> unless you don't need to support ie that is
[10:08:57] <arnas> Cork, that's what babel is for
[10:09:11] <naftilos76> i have not interest to support IE
[10:09:12] <Cork> why transcode when you can just write compatible code?
[10:09:22] <arnas> Cork, are you serious?
[10:09:26] <Cork> yes'
[10:09:28] <arnas> or just trolling?
[10:09:41] <Cork> i'm dead serious
[10:09:46] <arnas> I don't think so :D
[10:09:51] <Cork> ok
[10:10:04] <arnas> why on earth would you use es5 when you can use es6 and all of it's beautiful features?
[10:10:20] <Cork> i want to write the code the browser runs, not something a script interprets and generates
[10:10:20] <daynaskully> {Q} why would $('.scroll-wrapper').bind("scroll", function () {}; always return zero for scrollTop()? -- actually any element i put in always returns 0 (i can use window to get the scroll position just fine - just specifically looking for the scrolltop of the element)
[10:10:48] <Cork> daynaskully: the element isn't in the page? (detatched)
[10:10:53] <arnas> Cork, and what difference does it make to you?
[10:11:05] <Cork> arnas: it makes debugging much simpler
[10:11:18] <arnas> Cork, that's what source maps are for
[10:11:31] <Cork> ug... and you don't see the problem with all that?
[10:11:34] <daynaskully> Cork, what do you mean detached? it's a div in the html and the jquery is on docready
[10:11:37] <arnas> Cork, no?
[10:11:45] <Cork> arnas: ok
[10:11:49] <arnas> Cork, what's the problem?
[10:12:05] <arnas> Cork, you're the first developer I hear saying that he'd rather use es5 than es6
[10:12:18] <Cork> arnas: no, no i love to use es6
[10:12:24] <Cork> when the environment supports it
[10:12:32] <Cork> i use it all the time for browser code and extensions
[10:12:35] <Cork> not on the web though
[10:12:42] <arnas> and when it doesn't, use babel. problem solved
[10:12:49] <Cork> no
[10:12:53] <arnas> how so?
[10:13:04] <Cork> i said it a little while ago
[10:13:14] <arnas> and my answer to that was source maps
[10:13:22] <arnas> and you didn't answer to that anything
[10:13:26] <Cork> ya, i saw that
[10:13:31] <Cork> but no thankx
[10:13:35] <arnas> because?
[10:13:49] <Cork> i don't see the gain of complicating the environment
[10:13:59] <arnas> :D
[10:14:08] <arnas> you said you love es6
[10:14:13] <arnas> that;'s the gain - you get to use it
[10:14:24] <Cork> sure, but that doesn't mean i'm madly in love
[10:14:35] <arnas> and if you're using web pack, gulp or whatever, adding babel doesn't complicate much
[10:14:45] <Cork> heh...
[10:15:20] <arnas> but you probably don't use these, too, because that complicates the environment :P
[10:15:50] <Cork> i don't use them cause i have other ways to do the same thing while i still write the code the browser gets
[10:16:09] <arnas> Cork, what ways are they?
[10:31:19] <hg55> Hello all. I struggle with an issue here related to DataTables and colResizable. When i enable sScrollY, resizing breaks for th. http://jsfiddle.net/eLm6ugp7/103/
[10:51:56] <apoorv> hello there people, im apoorv and im new over here, im looking for some project or something that i can work on, please help me!
[11:01:21] <Cork> apoorv: => ##freelance if you want to look for work/workers this channel is for getting coding help
[11:12:18] <Gsham> normally ill use an anonymous function but here i wanted to use a function: $(document).on('click', '.star-user', addStar(e) ); when i got in the function to use e.preventdfualt i get an error that e does not exist
[11:12:38] <Cork> Gsham: don't add (e)
[11:12:49] <Gsham> but then how can i use rpeventdefualt in my function
[11:12:52] <Cork> that goes in the function declration
[11:13:09] <hg55> Any suggestions on this? I struggle with an issue here related to DataTables and colResizable. When i enable sScrollY, resizing breaks for th. http://jsfiddle.net/eLm6ugp7/103/
[11:13:10] <Gsham> how does it get past to the function?
[11:13:16] <Cork> function addStar(e) {}
[11:13:23] <Cork> it is in the declaration
[11:13:36] <Cork> on doesn't care what you call the argument
[11:13:45] <Cork> it just puts the value in the first one
[11:14:28] <Gsham> oh
[11:14:29] <Gsham> thanks
[11:14:49] <Gsham> i have a click event inside a click event and im trying to stop the outer elements event when clicking the inner one
[11:14:55] <Gsham> preventdefualt aint working
[11:16:13] <Gsham> ill try stopPropagation()
[11:16:38] <Cork> Gsham: the best solution is for the outer event handler to check if the event.target is inside the second
[11:17:01] <Cork> Gsham: you want to avoid stopPropagation as it makes it impossible to use the event for other uses in the page
[11:17:08] <Cork> (so you can get obscure bugs later)
[11:17:17] <Gsham> oh ok. so on outter elements click i check target
[11:17:52] <Gsham> even though im using delegation
[11:17:53] <Gsham> like document.on('clcick', element...
[11:17:54] <Cork> something like $(event.target).closest('inner element').length > 0
[11:18:01] <Gsham> got it
[11:18:06] <Cork> if that is true just return; in the if case
[11:18:12] <Cork> and do the normal after the if case
[11:19:52] <Gsham> closest goes up the tree thugh
[11:20:01] <Gsham> on the utter element am i not searching for if the target is inside
[11:20:22] <Cork> no cause event.target is the element that was clicked
[11:20:28] <Cork> not the element the event handler is on
[11:20:28] <Gsham> ah.
[11:20:40] <Cork> and btw event is e in your case
[11:27:15] <Gsham> i know :). im semi intelligent.
[11:27:19] <Gsham> thanks Cork! works
[11:28:02] <Circuitsoft> Hello - question. When I run <an element>.n('dragstart', function(evt)), evt.target is not <an element>. Should I be looking for something other than evt.target?
[11:28:14] <Circuitsoft> *.n = .on
[11:28:15] <snover> Cork: the better way to do that is to annotate the event object with a property that is set by a child event handler that has processed the event.
[11:28:51] <snover> `event.consumedByInner = true;` in the inner element handler, `if (event.consumedByInner)` in the outer element handler
[11:32:19] <Cork> snover: that is an option, and it reduces the dom traversal
[11:32:38] <Cork> haven't thought of that as a solution i must admit
[12:08:35] <reynierpm> I have the following HTML "<tr data-id="75"><td><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="delete">Delete</a></td></tr>" and I need to get the tr data-id attr, I am doing in this way https://jsbin.com/kikiposoje/edit?html,js,output but I am getting null what I am missing
[12:08:36] <reynierpm> ?
[12:09:14] <robertmaxrees> bad example fwiw.
[12:09:30] <robertmaxrees> and the parent of the <a> is that td.
[12:09:36] <robertmaxrees> use .closest('tr') instead.
[12:10:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsbin.com/sayohitonu/1/edit?html,js,console,output reynierpm
[12:10:31] <robertmaxrees> also bas use of .find()
[12:10:56] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, gotcha
[12:11:02] <reynierpm> thx
[12:11:19] <robertmaxrees> .parent().find() goes to the parent element and then looks through all its descendents.
[12:11:22] <robertmaxrees> not what you needed in this case :)
[12:12:54] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ya I get it
[12:12:56] <phelix> So I am sending an AJAX request to a url. I can see in dev tools that its returning the response in the response tab. But for some reason I keep getting a No Access-Control-Allow-Origin error in my console and the error function is being called instead of the success. Anyone know what could be happening?
[12:13:06] <robertmaxrees> phelix yep.
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> you're calling a resource on a different origin.
[12:13:25] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain all need to match.
[12:13:34] <phelix> Yes, but it allows for it.
[12:13:41] <robertmaxrees> obviously it doesn't :)
[12:13:46] <robertmaxrees> the remote resource needs to have a special configuration to enable it.
[12:13:49] <phelix> Well why is it giving me the results?
[12:14:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) caching?
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> chrome is funky about that stuff sometimes.
[12:14:10] <robertmaxrees> I've seen it before.
[12:14:24] <phelix> hmm
[12:14:33] <robertmaxrees> do you control the remote resource?
[12:15:06] <phelix> I dont.. but look you can even visit the url and see results just fine. https://midatlantic.tstllc.net/web-services/common/autocomplete?options=%5B%22airports%22%2C%22cities%22%2C%22hotels%22%5D&term=bois
[12:15:32] <phelix> i get error code 200 OK in dev tools on the xhr request.
[12:16:05] <robertmaxrees> none of that changes anything about CORS :)
[12:16:10] <phelix> ya
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> you could create a server-side proxy to handle this for you.
[12:16:59] <phelix> hmm, would prefer not to have to do this.. But I basically need to have remote host allow my domain?
[12:17:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:18:24] <phelix> hmm ok thanks
[12:18:41] <robertmaxrees> you could also proxy through your own server
[12:19:30] <phelix> Yea, I just find this kind of odd that any browser can view the results and even dev tools is getting the results But jquery wont.
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> iot
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> *it's not jquery.
[12:19:45] <robertmaxrees> it's the browser.
[12:19:55] <phelix> yes, that is what i meant sorry.
[12:20:07] <robertmaxrees> it's to protect you from malicious users.
[12:20:14] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with the type of attack it prevents?
[12:20:26] <phelix> yes, I understand the purpose of it. but usually sites that don't want anyone getting into stuff sets up some type of auth
[12:20:32] <phelix> yes a little
[12:20:55] <robertmaxrees> right, but in most cases CORS isn't configured by default for your server.
[12:22:11] <phelix> Well my server is just on my local machine right now.
[12:22:26] <phelix> But the server I am trying to get data from obviously is not.
[12:22:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:22:44] <robertmaxrees> your server doesn't matter here fwiw.
[12:23:03] <phelix> ya
[12:37:01] <snover> phelix: whether or not a site has an authentication system is irrelevant to the attack vector that same origin policy prevents. XHR requests send authentication tokens (i.e. cookies or HTTP Authorization headers) that are already stored in the browser to the target domain. Without SOP, anyone could pull private information from any site you were logged into
[12:37:20] <SpecialTech> Hey guys, is there a reason why I can't move forward if I check in the active panel for a class called validation error? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zoWzwy
[12:37:57] <phelix> Yes, I agree its important. Was just curious why browser shows results but success function appeared to be getting errors.
[12:40:21] <snover> GET requests are allowed to occur without preflight with certain conditions (like no custom headers) for performance reasons, but the response has to have valid CORS headers for the browser to release the data to the requesting script.
[12:41:16] <phelix> ahh ok
[12:43:53] <SpecialTech> Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong
[12:46:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue, SpecialTech?
[12:46:58] <robertmaxrees> looks like I'm able to click next all the time.
[12:47:28] <phelix> hmm adding dataType: 'jsonp' made it work
[12:47:34] <SpecialTech> Yea, and I'm trying to not allow to click next if not on lasttab, or if validation-error exists in the active tab
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> phelix that's changing the request being made.
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech so then your problem statement was wrong?
[12:48:54] <robertmaxrees> $('.active').closest('.validation-error'); this is probably the issue btw.
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes through ancestor elements.
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech make sense?
[12:50:44] <SpecialTech> would it be .find()?
[12:50:51] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[12:51:31] <SpecialTech> running through the api i'm debating .next or .find
[12:51:36] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[12:51:38] <robertmaxrees> not .next()
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> .active() is a parent of the element that you're looking for.
[12:52:10] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.active').find('error') or w/e the classes are.
[13:11:51] <Croves> Hi! Does anyone know why my .css() selector isn't working on line 6? http://dpaste.com/0V8E381
[13:12:29] <robertmaxrees> "selector"? you mean the rule you're trying to change?
[13:13:17] <elit3x> i need to call a jquery function to update a certain piece of the page whenever someone lands on the page by hitting the back button.  When they hit back the data is not updated, unless they do an actual refresh.... What is the right method to use for this? is $( document ).ready() correct ?
[13:13:20] <Croves> robertmaxrees: Yes! I'm trying to change a inline style from the element
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> Croves inspect the elemet - see any changes to it?
[13:13:42] <Croves> robertmaxrees: nope
[13:13:57] <robertmaxrees> Croves does the element in question exist when the code runs?
[13:14:16] <Croves> robertmaxrees: the element exist, but it is hidden
[13:14:21] <Croves> not visible
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> elit3x  http://stackoverflow.com/a/2008831/923919
[13:15:03] <robertmaxrees> Croves and if you do a like console.log($('.whatever').css('position'));, what do you get?
[13:15:10] <Teduardo> I have a search box where a user can type in a string, but instead of searching i just want it to take that user to /c/"user string" when they hit enter or perform the search, is this fairly easy to do?
[13:15:16] <robertmaxrees> like right after you try to set it.
[13:15:27] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo pretty easy
[13:16:43] <Croves> robertmaxrees: console.log($('.tooltip').css('top')); returns me '77px';
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> then it's getting set
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> well, presumably.
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the css positioning of the element?
[13:17:39] <Teduardo> robertmaxrees: something like binding to the id of the box with an event listener and then using whatever the jquery redirect code is?
[13:17:52] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo there's no "jquery redirect code" heh.
[13:18:05] <robertmaxrees> you just set window.location.href to whatever + user input
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> Croves fwiw you can't just set "top" without also changing the position of the element.
[13:19:51] <Croves> robertmaxrees: I don't understand
[13:20:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zc5utc0a/1/
[13:20:20] <robertmaxrees> see how that's still at the top?
[13:20:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zc5utc0a/2/ vs this.
[13:20:38] <Teduardo> robertmaxrees: Okay, so it sounds like onsubmit would work for the form then.
[13:21:03] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo use a jquery event binding fwow.
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> not html attributed.
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> *attributes
[13:21:19] <Croves> robertmaxrees: hm... sorry... I still don't get it
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> Croves look at the two diffles.
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> *fiddles.
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> see how they look different>?
[13:22:14] <Croves> robertmaxrees: Yes, one have the 'position' property
[13:22:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:23:05] <robertmaxrees> without you setting that to absolute or fixed or w/e, you're SOL.
[13:23:59] <Croves> robertmaxrees: But it shouldn't, at least, change the value inside the element? Even if the position doesn't move?
[13:24:15] <Croves> Because my original css sets top to 77px, and I'm trying to set it to 177px in this case
[13:24:26] <Croves> But the 77px remains intact in my 'style=""'
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating markup with the DOM
[13:25:17] <robertmaxrees> though that likely should update, something seems amiss here.
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> can you make a test case?
[13:28:46] <Teduardo> is there an issue with jsfiddle and forms? it seems to say that a simple form is not validating
[13:30:52] <robertmaxrees> link?
[13:31:57] <Teduardo> https://jsfiddle.net/6y4poa4u/
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> what validation are you talking abnout?
[13:33:34] <Teduardo> if you click run and type something in the box and press enter it throws what looks like an error in json format
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not what iu'm getting at all.
[13:33:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting the alert.
[13:34:31] <Teduardo> I... uhh ... I see
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:35:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6y4poa4u/2/ try this maybe?
[13:35:04] <Teduardo> i just refreshed it again and it now brings up the alert..... super confused about it but we're going with it
[13:35:16] <robertmaxrees> probably a caching issue.
[13:36:17] <phelix> http://pastebin.com/gHEK5e5s any idea why the url in the ajax response doesn't seem to be working? Whenever I type something it keeps trying to use a localhost and I get this error. jquery.min.js?v=1.8.3:2 GET http://mywebsite.com/null?query=boi 404 (Not Found)
[13:37:17] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'jsonp',
[13:37:42] <robertmaxrees> does the endpoint support jsonp?
[13:38:02] <phelix> yes. If i run just the $.ajax and use jsonp it works just fine
[13:38:10] <phelix> what is weird is its not using what i specify in the url:
[13:38:16] <robertmaxrees> sec
[13:38:18] <phelix> its going to its own domain /null
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> "its going to its own domain /null"
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> are you running this on an actual server?
[13:39:21] <robertmaxrees> or just off files on your hard drive?
[13:39:40] <phelix> on my local host.
[13:39:46] <robertmaxrees> something here seems strange.
[13:39:49] <phelix> yah
[13:40:01] <robertmaxrees> "on my local host" so you'
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> *you're not just double-clicking an html file and loading that into a browser, right?
[13:40:23] <phelix> ohh no
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> and make sure you'ree clearing cache.
[13:40:29] <phelix> its actually running apache etc.
[13:40:40] <phelix> its a mirror setup of the actual server.
[13:40:48] <robertmaxrees> close browser fully, reopen, etc.
[13:40:53] <phelix> k let me try that
[13:41:58] <phelix> Yea it still just wants to send to websites-domin.com/null?query=boi
[13:42:03] <phelix> instead of whats specified in the url
[13:42:05] <phelix> super weird
[13:42:34] <phelix> not even sending parameters correctly.
[13:42:38] <robertmaxrees> link to the code again?
[13:42:50] <phelix> http://pastebin.com/gHEK5e5s
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6ukvdfvq/
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> not changing the URL here.
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> what version of jq and jqui?
[13:45:10] <phelix> looks like 1.8.3
[13:45:27] <phelix> weird.. especially since if i pull it out of the autocomplete function the ajax call works just fine
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> what version of JQUI?
[13:45:49] <phelix> 1.8.3
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> and JQ?
[13:46:17] <robertmaxrees> i might update jqui to 1.12.
[13:46:33] <phelix> Yea, was thinking it could be my version
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> *1.12.1 and jq to 1.13.x
[14:16:53] <Teduardo> Howdy, does anyone know why this doesn't seem to do anything? I am expecting it to say "hi" when i type something in the box and hit enter
[14:16:55] <Teduardo> http://pastebin.com/z1rBKjQf
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> the input doesn't exist when you try to bind to it.
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> you need a document ready.
[14:19:07] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lghv3ct5/1/
[14:20:47] <Teduardo> thanks, I think I have it working now.
[14:21:00] <robertmaxrees> and start using the console instead of alerts btw.
[14:38:09] <OnceMe> how can I modify or actually append something to the url without refreshing page?
[14:38:18] <robertmaxrees> using the historyu API
[14:38:23] <robertmaxrees> *history
[14:38:29] <OnceMe> more like, something liek this: /main?add=me&test=stuff and such
[14:38:39] <robertmaxrees> right.  the history API.  pushstates
[14:38:40] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: cant do with jquery?
[14:38:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> and not all browsers support it.
[14:41:38] <OnceMe> hmm
[14:41:45] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: it seems page is reloading
[14:41:59] <robertmaxrees> how are you changing the URL?>
[14:42:18] <OnceMe> var myURL = document.location; document.location = myURL + "?a=parameter";
[14:42:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not the history api
[14:42:43] <OnceMe> window.history.pushState('obj', 'newtitle', newUrlWithQueryString) ?
[14:42:46] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries
[14:42:49] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:44:06] <OnceMe> hmm if some browsers do not support history push state, I should rely my logic when users are selecting packages on a website?
[14:44:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:46:09] <OnceMe> ?
[14:46:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand the question.
[14:46:31] <robertmaxrees> "I should rely my logic when users are selecting packages on a website?" doesn't make sense ot me.
[14:46:32] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[14:46:47] <OnceMe> have you used digitalocean before?
[14:46:56] <robertmaxrees> they're just a hosting provider.
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with your question (shrug)
[14:47:27] <OnceMe> when you create new server on DO, your link changes based on which package you choose https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?i=x&distro=ubuntu&distroImage=ubuntu-16-04-x64&size=512mb&region=nyc3
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> requires login.
[14:47:56] <robertmaxrees> you can create a fallback.
[14:47:58] <OnceMe> yeah but thats just an example
[14:48:08] <OnceMe> what kind of fallback?
[14:48:09] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of a weird idea.
[14:48:15] <robertmaxrees> why would you need the URL to update for that?
[14:48:25] <OnceMe> well they do it that way
[14:48:32] <OnceMe> when I select a new package, url link modifies
[14:48:41] <robertmaxrees> just because a site does something doesn't mean you should do it to.
[14:48:48] <robertmaxrees> *too
[14:49:17] <OnceMe> ok Ill create fallback too
[14:49:20] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:49:21] <OnceMe> btw window.history.pushState('obj', 'newtitle', document.location) this doesnt work
[14:49:21] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:49:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:49:38] <OnceMe> ?
[14:49:48] <robertmaxrees> 1) is the updated url that important for old browsers?
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> 2) did you read the mdn article?
[14:53:45] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: ok fixed url thing
[14:53:49] <OnceMe> but how to make fallback for older browsers now?
[14:54:01] <robertmaxrees> you just don't rely on the url.
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can try using hashes but that's kind of janky and a PITA and doesn't really work the same.
[14:54:25] <OnceMe> but on selectors too?
[14:54:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:54:34] <OnceMe> on what I should rely
[14:54:36] <robertmaxrees> none of this involves selectoors.
[14:54:43] <OnceMe> if not on url
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to change the URL when the user selects a package?
[14:55:01] <robertmaxrees> like, what does that actually add to the user's experience?
[14:55:12] <OnceMe> because it looks nice and they can paste link to other user
[14:55:21] <OnceMe> and when they visit the link they will get already selected package
[14:55:26] <OnceMe> and its not just package, its a bunch of stuff
[14:55:33] <robertmaxrees> they won't really notice the URL thing.
[14:55:44] <robertmaxrees> and they won't share as much as you think they will.
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> but if it's really THAT important, then just have old browsers to full pagelaods.
[14:56:07] <OnceMe> how to accomplish that?
[14:56:36] <robertmaxrees> detect the feature in the browser and use your code if it exists.
[14:56:43] <robertmaxrees> btw make sure you properly handle the back button.
[15:48:23] <robertmaxrees> boom
[15:59:09] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: how do I modify url param
[15:59:12] <OnceMe> instead of appending it
[15:59:24] <robertmaxrees> you have to set the url with the modified param
[16:00:20] <robertmaxrees> imo best way to manage that is to store state in an object whose keys are the qsp names and values are the qsp values.
[16:00:24] <robertmaxrees> super easy to build out the url then.
[16:00:31] <OnceMe> window.history.pushState(stateObj, 'newtitle', document.location+"?click_id=3");
[16:00:53] <OnceMe> click_id already exists in url, and when I call this again, it just gets appended
[16:01:08] <OnceMe> how can I search and modify existing click_id param
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use document.location
[16:01:20] <robertmaxrees> do what i suggested with the object.
[16:01:21] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[16:01:23] <robertmaxrees> i've done this before.
[16:03:23] <OnceMe> qsp names are what?
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> query string parameter names.
[16:03:35] <robertmaxrees> foo=bar
[16:04:20] <OnceMe> do you have an example?
[16:04:29] <OnceMe> because I need to check this upon click and on init of page
[16:04:43] <robertmaxrees> what do you need an example of?
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> the object thing?
[16:04:57] <OnceMe> yeah
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> uh, sure?
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[16:07:51] <robertmaxrees> can you safely assume a port, protocol, and domain?
[16:08:14] <OnceMe> not really
[16:08:18] <OnceMe> I have staging server and stuff..
[16:08:25] <OnceMe> different domains
[16:08:33] <robertmaxrees> and you can't expose those via js somehow?
[16:08:34] <robertmaxrees> butmmer.
[16:08:36] <robertmaxrees> *bummer
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[16:09:48] <OnceMe> all browsers
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> can you assume the path part of the url?
[16:10:31] <OnceMe> no
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an awful system.
[16:11:08] <OnceMe> :(
[16:11:19] <robertmaxrees> you should be exposing a lot of that information.
[16:11:21] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[16:12:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j7tLvxbk/
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> you could use something like this.
[16:12:28] <robertmaxrees> maintain state in that object.
[16:13:02] <robertmaxrees> also are you using es5shim?
[16:13:14] <OnceMe> no
[16:13:17] <OnceMe> whats that
[16:13:20] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[16:13:33] <robertmaxrees> it shims in js support so you can use things like .map()
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> *js support for es5.
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> since you care about older browsers, you'll need it.
[16:18:00] <OnceMe> sec
[16:19:02] <OnceMe> this not work
[16:19:02] <OnceMe> ?foo=string%20one&bar=string%20two&baz=string%20three
[16:19:02] <OnceMe> i get that in my url
[16:19:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:19:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a valid querystring.
[16:19:30] <OnceMe> why do I fill state object with those data
[16:19:38] <OnceMe> but incorrect string
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> you replace the key/value pairs with your own duder.
[16:19:46] <OnceMe> foo may be 1 2 3 or 4
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> it's an example.
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> it's not a copy/pastable solution.
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to work with it.
[16:20:39] <OnceMe> yes
[16:20:42] <OnceMe> but I only have one param
[16:20:46] <OnceMe> and multiple values
[16:20:47] <OnceMe> so for foo
[16:20:52] <OnceMe> strine one is only one value
[16:20:55] <OnceMe> what with the rest of values?
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:20:59] <OnceMe> string one*
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:21:04] <OnceMe> lol
[16:21:05] <robertmaxrees> you should have said that earlier.
[16:21:09] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[16:21:14] <OnceMe> they are not fixed
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:21:24] <robertmaxrees> well aware.
[16:21:30] <robertmaxrees> but you don't even needs something like this.
[16:21:45] <OnceMe> ok solved
[16:21:46] <robertmaxrees> look at how I get the current URL.
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> *base URL.
[16:21:57] <robertmaxrees> and then go from there.
[16:22:22] <robertmaxrees> well that's fucking metal.
[16:22:27] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong channel.
[16:23:47] <OnceMe> :D
[16:52:41] <External> Hey guys, im having a problem where I am getting "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined" even after I add jquery to the webpage and give it time
[16:52:59] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab.
[16:53:08] <robertmaxrees> make sure jquery isn't 404ing.
[16:53:39] <robertmaxrees> and make sure noConflict isn't getting set.
[16:56:09] <External> Network is fine, "$.noConflict();" would get rid of the no conflict problem right?
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:38] <robertmaxrees> $.noConflict() relinquishes control of $ back to whatever had it before.
[16:57:53] <External> im not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, could you please dumb that down?
[16:58:30] <robertmaxrees> so let's say you load a library that globally sets $
[16:58:33] <robertmaxrees> and then you load jquery
[16:59:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery will destroy that other library.  to $.noConflict() gives $ back to whatever had it before jquery tried to use it.
[17:06:08] <External> i dont think I am having that problem. my script works fine when running it in chrome console, but as soon as I try to run it from my extension I run into this problem
[17:09:16] <shoky> External: extensions don't run in the same js environment as the page
[17:12:23] <External> @shoky, maybe im stupid, but I am running it as a content script, wouldnt that work?
[17:13:28] <shoky> External: nothing to do with stupidity - just read docs - https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts
[17:13:54] <shoky> External: "However, content scripts have some limitations. They cannot:" .. "Use variables or functions defined by web pages or by other content scripts"
[17:14:11] <shoky> External: "Although the execution environments of content scripts and the pages that host them are isolated from each other, they share access to the page's DOM. If the page wishes to communicate with the content script (or with the extension via the content script), it must do so through the shared DOM.
[17:14:36] <shoky> External: so if you want to use jquery in your content script, you'll need to include jquery in your extension
[17:14:48] <shoky> or possibly load from a cdn, dono
[17:15:07] <External> I have jquery load at the start of script
[17:15:24] <External> and checking chrome console confirms that it is loaded properly
[17:16:12] <shoky> console can be in different contexts - you can set it to the page's context, or to the extension's context
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> by default it's the page
[17:16:49] <External> it is in the page, I have searched through and checked
[17:18:37] <External> I have looked through a good amount of documentation regarding this error and havent found anything that solves my problem
[17:19:04] <robertmaxrees> so you set your console to the correct context?
[17:19:46] <External> @robert, yes
[17:19:56] <External> here is the code if that makes it easier http://pastebin.com/S81PShVV
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> need to define it via the manifest.json
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> also: why include jquery if you're not going to use it?
[17:22:02] <External> I do use it........
[17:22:19] <robertmaxrees> kind of?
[17:22:19] <External> i think
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> you're not even using sizzle, which is like half the magic
[17:22:36] <External> im confused
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> $(document.getElementsByClassName("kix-cursor docs-ui-unprintable"))
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> why call document.getElementsByClassName ?
[17:23:53] <External> idk, is there a better way to do what I am doing there?
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> use css selectors
[17:24:39] <robertmaxrees> $('.kix-cursor, .docs-ui-unprintable')
[17:26:45] <External> changed it, lol, thanks
[17:27:11] <robertmaxrees> also you're doing some type coercion there that's a little... hairy.
[17:27:19] <robertmaxrees> explicitly convert from strings to numbers.
[17:28:47] <External> this is my first project with jquery, this whole thing could probably done in 3 seconds by someone but it took me a day
[17:28:48] <robertmaxrees> what is this actually trying to do?
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> every second, move something?
[17:29:17] <External> @Robert, have you ever been in a google doc with 2 people?
[17:29:27] <robertmaxrees> si.
[17:29:55] <External> have you ever had someone type below you and their name tag cover what your writing or editing?
[17:30:50] <robertmaxrees> every once in a while.
[17:30:58] <External> all it does is move their name tag from above their cursor to below it
[17:31:09] <robertmaxrees> every second?
[17:31:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:37] <External> wekk it checks every second if the other editor is within 1 line below or above them
[17:31:43] <External> *well
[17:32:20] <External> I thought it might be a good project to get to know jquery and chrome extensions
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:34:36] <External> I will now go research how exactly to "define it via the manifest.json"
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3227225/923919
[17:36:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:40:55] <External> within that js I would just use the same code to inject it as I did in my orginal script right?
[17:41:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't injext it any more
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> *inject it
[17:41:48] <External> the thing u linked says do this
[17:41:49] <External> "js": ["jquery-1.4.2.js", "extension.js"]
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:41:58] <robertmaxrees> that's it;
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> should be ready to use after that.
[17:42:06] <External> within that jquery file what do I write?
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> you include a copy of jquery.
[17:42:25] <External> ohhhhhhhhh
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> as apart of the extension
[17:42:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd use something more modern than 1.4.2
[17:43:15] <cannap> hi
[19:11:14] <moonbeast> hello all, hopefully a real simple question, I have set the background of a canvas element to a colour, say red, I need to use JQuery to retrieve the value of background, how is this done?
[19:22:19] <Motoservo> Does anybody know of a framework (or plugin) that would build a lightbox but with various (artbitrary) elements allowed to stay in in front? So, where a traditional lightbox may obscure all but an image I need several colums in a table to remain in the front.
[19:22:56] <jacob144> Is there a way to manually delete a cookie when the browser/window closes
[20:05:59] <jacob144> Is there a way to manually delete a cookie when the browser/window closes?
[20:06:15] <jacob144> Guys?
[20:06:24] <jacob144> anyone there?
[20:16:24] <dni-> jacob144 use the unload event https://api.jquery.com/unload/
[20:24:35] <jacob144> dni: I just can't get it to work. I don't have a expiring date applied, is that the problem?
[20:25:07] <jacob144> It says it is a session cookie in inspect element
