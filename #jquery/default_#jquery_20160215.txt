[05:54:31] <Jonno_FTW> I have another problem
[06:15:27] <Arnsa> hello
[06:15:53] <Arnsa> why can't I do this $("selector")[0].css("some css"); ?
[06:16:28] <Omar-> Arnsa $("selector")[0] isnt a jquery object
[06:16:30] <arc_> Arnsa because css() is a jquery method
[06:16:34] <arc_> and works on jquery objects
[06:16:46] <Arnsa> Omar-, so how do I make it jquery object?
[06:16:54] <Omar-> Arnsa $("selector")
[06:16:59] <Omar-> that's all
[06:17:00] <arc_> you can just use first() to select the same thing as [0] is
[06:17:05] <Arnsa> oh
[06:17:11] <arc_> or eq() to select any other number
[06:17:24] <Omar-> or :first
[06:17:29] <arc_> ya
[06:17:39] <Omar-> $(".selector:first").css()
[06:17:43] <Arnsa> thanks
[06:17:53] <Omar-> you can use :nth-child too
[06:18:03] <Omar-> :nth-child()
[06:18:23] <Omar-> :first-child
[06:18:27] <Omar-> many ways
[06:19:01] <Omar-> arc_ :)
[06:19:05] <Omar-> Arnsa welcome
[06:19:19] <Omar-> any jQM dev team?
[06:24:26] <Arnsa> Omar-, arc_ $("selector").first().css("dislay", "none"); <- is it normal that it doesn't work? It select the correct item, but it doesn't set display to none for some reason
[06:25:03] <arc_> Arnsa well, you mistyped display
[06:25:16] <Arnsa> arc_, ... thanks
[06:25:20] <arc_> ;)
[06:27:46] <Omar-> display
[06:27:48] <Omar-> typo
[06:27:53] <arc_> Omar- i think you probably want #jquery-dev
[06:27:53] <Omar-> arc_ +!
[06:27:55] <Omar-> +1
[06:28:19] <Omar-> arc_ they're either asleep or busy coding for jQM 1.5
[06:28:26] <arc_> ok ;)
[06:28:51] <Omar-> !ping arschmitz
[06:29:25] <Omar-> arc_ thanks :)

[06:56:53] <ZiXXiV> When a youtube-video dynamically gets loaded within a SWFObject, how can you play it if it creates the SWFObject when the tab is NOT FOCUSSED?
[06:57:00] <ZiXXiV> Any hack/workaround for that?
[06:57:15] <arc_> on your tombstone they will engrave: cut down in his prime by datepicker
[06:57:43] <game0> guys, I need some suggestion in this, I'm having java class that will generate json response and I have ajax to red the json response, every resquest will have different json response, my problem is that I viewing the json response as content of some page form and I want to send the same json back to the java class to take action once the user clicks on submit button and deliver back the result of this, can someone suggest me how to do this or at least give
[06:57:43] <game0> me some feedback

[07:26:36] <blinky_> Hi guys, I am trying to make a timer script that will listen for key presses from the user, should the user not use the keyboard in a certain period of time it will call a script to log the user out.  I have got the timer to work but it will only start once the keyboard is pressed for the first time.  How do I change it so that it will work when the page loads but also resets the timer if the keyboard is used? - http://pastie.org/10722568
[07:28:22] <ZiXXiV> Lol, where does the timer start? Its defined but where does it start? x'D
[07:28:53] <blinky_> ZiXXiV, $input.on('keyup', function () {}
[07:28:57] <ZiXXiV> oh nvm
[07:29:01] <ZiXXiV> lol, looked wrong.
[07:29:28] <ZiXXiV> afaik you just have to add the 3 keyup lines to document ready.
[07:30:05] <blinky_> 2 secs will test now
[07:30:12] <ZiXXiV> $(document).ready( function() { //here } );
[07:30:32] <ZiXXiV> maybe typo, but you know where i'm going.
[07:30:53] <ZiXXiV> yeah comma.. >.< anyway report back please once tested. Thanks.
[07:32:33] <arc_> you can use .on() for ready events as well
[07:37:06] <blinky_> ok, so I have it working but it looks a little messy, I ended up having to use both the document ready and the keyup as it did not reset the timer.  Is there any way of making this cleaner or is it good enough? - http://pastie.org/10722587

[07:57:27] <AbbasHaroon> Hello, I am using .slideDown() for a drop down menu, I am removing and adding elements to it dynamically but the problem is that it's height doesn't change after initial page load. Is there anyway to make jquery recalculate the height before slidedown?
[07:58:27] <hellyeah> humm,
[07:58:38] <hellyeah> so you want to calculate height of text in the menu
[07:58:57] <hellyeah> you can increase height of menu depends on heights of character
[07:59:16] <hellyeah> actually calculating height dynamically is not wise solution if you ask me
[07:59:30] <hellyeah> if i understand true give fixed height
[07:59:32] <hellyeah> ops
[07:59:34] <hellyeah> width
[07:59:40] <AbbasHaroon> Nops
[07:59:44] <hellyeah> use word-break:break-all;
[08:00:04] <AbbasHaroon> My wrapper div don't have any height set, it's hidden by default
[08:00:28] <AbbasHaroon> when page get loaded, on first slideDown(), jQuery set a height for the wrapper of the menu
[08:00:43] <AbbasHaroon> but that height remain fixed for the page unless it's relaoded
[08:01:10] <AbbasHaroon> the problem is that I removed items from that wrapper or add them to it mostly <li>
[08:01:37] <hellyeah> do you have fiddle?
[08:01:39] <AbbasHaroon> so I want jquery to not fix the height of the menu, just slide it down
[08:01:44] <AbbasHaroon> Okay lemme create one
[08:02:05] <hellyeah> may be jquery has a behaivour like that
[08:10:01] <hellyeah> hey
[08:10:12] <hellyeah> how can i keep jquery datepicker open constantly
[08:10:14] <hellyeah> ?
[08:14:23] <blinky_> hellyeah, I presume you have looked at this page? - http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[08:15:32] <hellyeah> it is really useful
[08:15:41] <tbb_B> blinky_: do you have an idea for my issue
[08:16:05] <hellyeah> blinky_: do you know about jquery ui i have a related question?
[08:16:36] <blinky_> No but I have used the datepicker a few times.  I have a page with a load of timepickers, 2 seconds
[08:16:41] <hellyeah> blinky_: i want to keep result datepicker open constantly do you know how to do it
[08:16:56] <hellyeah> can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/3/
[08:24:31] <blinky_> hellyeah, http://pastie.org/10722632 - this creates an open datetime picker
[08:24:50] <Jonno_FTW> is there a plugin that will orient photos correctly like facebook does?
[08:25:47] <blinky_> hellyeah, Whats with the looping alert, thats not so nice.
[08:26:07] <hellyeah> looping alert?
[08:26:21] <blinky_> nope, my bad :)
[08:26:41] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/4/
[08:26:56] <hellyeah> do you havce fiddle blinky_?
[08:27:06] <blinky_> yeah
[08:27:23] <hellyeah> can you show me in fiddle
[08:27:39] <hellyeah> the things are in pastie.org
[08:34:16] <dddh> is it safe to include javascript if that url will 302 redirect me to other url?
[08:34:24] <dddh> maybe cdn or somewhere else
[08:34:56] <dddh> here should be some limits
[08:34:59] <dddh> *there
[08:36:14] <blinky_> hellyeah, Nope, I cant get it to work in fiddle.  I know it works as I have it all over the site I am working on.  I have the datetimepicker js script downloaded and link to that.  I think it is different to the datepicker that you are using though.
[08:36:37] <hellyeah> okey i will take a look
[08:36:42] <hellyeah> thanks anyway
[08:37:07] <tbb_B> can anyone help me and fix my code https://jsfiddle.net/1qenxnng/1/ that the rows constantly will blink
[08:43:44] <Xatenev> tbb_B: with blink you mean going yellow to white over and over again?
[08:43:52] <Xatenev> like in the beginning?
[08:43:54] <tbb_B> yeah
[08:45:38] <Mark____> hey, is it possible to give some sort of order to the jquery script load?
[08:46:19] <Xatenev> tbb_B: https://jsfiddle.net/1qenxnng/2/
[08:46:24] <Xatenev> tbb_B: something like that?^^
[08:46:53] <Xatenev> tbb_B: you had to wrap the part where the flash() function is called into a setInterval() so it is called over and over and over again.
[08:48:08] <Xatenev> tbb_B: or a little more chilled: https://jsfiddle.net/1qenxnng/3/ - just set the time for the setInterval whatever you want :)
[08:49:02] <hellyeah> need help about jquery datepicker anyone around here can help me?
[08:50:43] <Xatenev> Mark____: ?
[08:50:51] <Mark____> um
[08:50:52] <Mark____> yes?
[08:50:52] <Xatenev> jquery script load? scripts are loaded in the order in which you include them
[08:51:00] <Mark____> yes i know that,
[08:51:06] <Xatenev> what do you mean?
[08:51:08] <Mark____> sec.
[08:52:46] <Mark____> im only askng this question because my CMS would load jquery ui library cdn later than the actual js plugin.
[08:52:46] <Mark____> and i have no control over the coding itself.
[08:52:47] <Mark____> thus leaving js plugin malfunctioning
[08:53:04] <Mark____> *copy pasted*
[08:53:24] <Xatenev> and how do you tell your CMS to include the js plugin ?
[08:53:29] <Xatenev> what CMS?
[08:53:52] <Mark____> it’s called XE it’s in foreign language,
[08:53:53] <tbb_B> Xatenev: thx that does the trick
[08:53:58] <Mark____> and i have no idea.
[08:54:40] <Xatenev> Mark____: umm
[08:54:49] <Mark____> but im on my way trying things
[08:54:53] <Mark____> so hopefully i’ll be able to fix
[08:55:11] <Mark____> this is the js plugin that i installed on my website https://rawgit.com/adamjimenez/ui.tabs.overflowResize/master/demo/index.html
[08:55:24] <Mark____> and it fails to close or open on my website.
[08:55:27] <Mark____> but draggble.
[08:55:28] <Mark____> so.
[08:56:04] <Xatenev> Mark____: sounds all bad already, just double include the jquery UI? ^^
[08:56:15] <Mark____> ah, that failed. i have tried :)
[08:56:21] <Xatenev> Mark____: really? why
[08:56:22] <Mark____> but thanks for the interest and help.
[08:56:26] <Mark____> they would collide.
[08:56:31] <Xatenev> k
[08:56:46] <Mark____> those tabs are tempting
[08:57:07] <Xatenev> Well you said you have no control over the code
[08:57:13] <Xatenev> and you dont know the CMS
[08:57:16] <Xatenev> how do you think you can solve that problem?^^
[08:57:39] <Mark____> i don’t know ^^
[08:57:47] <Xatenev> you cant.
[08:57:51] <Mark____> where are you from btw? are you from the Europe?
[08:58:03] <Mark____> i have never seen anyone using that ^^ except few people here.
[08:58:03] <Xatenev> get control over the code or check out if your CMS offers any possibility to change the scripts which are loaded.
[08:58:08] <Xatenev> im from europe
[08:58:19] <Mark____> okay.
[08:58:42] <Xatenev> A japanese CMS lolß
[08:59:17] <Mark____> Korean.
[08:59:26] <Mark____> i don’tthink Japan has its own CMS
[08:59:40] <Xatenev> Are you korean?^^
[08:59:44] <Mark____> yes i am
[09:02:15] <hellyeah> hey i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/9/ i can disable dates in below datepicker when i select the date after creating it. I want top colorize the dates with different colors. I mean each different selection and one code in date of range
[09:02:31] <hellyeah> can yo help me to figure out how i can do this?
[09:17:09] <hellyeah> fixed
[09:45:56] <km4> https://jsfiddle.net/L5o7uycp/ low code but cant switch this element show/hide
[09:49:18] <slax0r> km4: there is no element with id users_in or contacts_out in that fiddle
[09:52:01] <bostonmacosx> hi there
[09:52:14] <km4> slax0r: ye ;p but its correct code or I should to minimalize this code ?
[09:52:35] <slax0r> I don't understand this
[09:52:43] <slax0r> and no, it's not correct
[09:53:00] <bostonmacosx> I have a listener that listens for change and blur....it is assigned to a form which includes select menus and text areas...what is happening is that the select is firing off twice...once on the change and once on the blur....any way to prevent that?
[09:53:03] <slax0r> you have selectors on #users_in an #contacts_out
[09:53:15] <slax0r> but in your html there is only .users_in and .contacts_out
[09:56:27] <km4> slax0r: I know, this html nvm I need the better solution of this code js
[09:56:38] <km4> or maybe switch any class
[09:56:43] <km4> not add and remove class
[09:57:12] <slax0r> well, there is .toggleClass
[09:58:35] <km4> know but have problem with add this correct
[09:58:48] <km4> with 2 radio input
[09:59:24] <slax0r> km4: yes, using toggle with 2 radios can be dangerous, because both will toggle, no matter what state the radios are in
[09:59:31] <slax0r> so you need a radio state change handler
[09:59:49] <slax0r> and check if radio A is checked, then add hide to classA, and remove from classB, and vice-versa
[10:03:08] <hellyeah> hgey
[10:03:40] <hellyeah> i know it is silly mistake i made but i hit ym head to the wall pls help what is the errror in line 77 http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/13/
[10:20:12] <shoky_> hellyeah you didn't close the datepickers function. missing a }
[10:20:34] <hellyeah> hmm ii fixed littkle bit http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/15/
[10:21:11] <shoky_> now you're not closing the  $(function() {
[10:21:19] <shoky_> click Tidy
[10:21:29] <shoky_> and check where the indentation is wrong..
[10:22:33] <hellyeah> i fixed
[10:23:03] <hellyeah> shoky_: you are sometimes i have trouble to see small things in long code
[10:23:13] <hellyeah> it did hurt my eyes
[10:23:31] <shoky_> then don't make your code so messy :S
[10:23:36] <shoky_> use proper indentation
[10:23:56] <shoky_> and shorter functions
[10:26:11] <hellyeah> good point xD
[10:36:30] <definity_> How can I select an item that jQuery has created
[10:36:57] <taplar> if it's in the dom you select it how you normally would
[10:39:01] <decx> if you created it you already should have a reference to it which you can... reference
[10:39:12] <bostonmacosx> anyone?
[10:39:42] <decx> well change and blur are different things
[10:39:51] <decx> both will fire
[10:40:54] <decx> like why even do stuff on blur
[10:46:11] <definity_> im using snapSVG and im trying to make my circle grown and shirt on mouse over not on the element i tried using its name bigCircle as the reference but it does not like that. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxoVaV?editors=1010
[10:46:19] <definity_> shrink*
[10:46:45] <bostonmacosx> we  blur for when you are finished typing in a text box and don't want to creat a button for EVERY field...
[10:47:37] <decx> but that's change
[10:47:49] <decx> blur just means you can focus a textfield, do nothing and then click outside it
[10:48:41] <decx> codepen should've use an .is tld instead of .io
[10:49:06] <bostonmacosx> yeah but I don't want it updating with each keystroke
[10:49:14] <decx> that would be input
[10:49:28] <decx> change just means you entered a textfield, changed some text and then blur
[10:50:38] <bostonmacosx> ah ok so change is really just blur as well?
[10:50:55] <bostonmacosx> but a blur with differences
[10:52:08] <decx> yes
[10:56:27] <decx> definity_: when is it supposed to grow?
[10:57:45] <definity_> well i want it to grown when the mouse is hovering over it, i manedge to do it with a class im just not sure how to do it with bigCircle.
[10:59:03] <decx> but the svg isnt in .svg ?!
[11:00:05] <definity_> I dont understand.
[11:00:42] <decx> it's not in there
[11:03:49] <definity_> Ahhh i got cha thanks :)
[11:04:16] <decx> what else are you using snap for
[11:04:24] <decx> seems a bit overkill to grow a circle
[11:25:05] <Mar__> Hello everyone

[11:51:43] <aperyon> hey guys! I could use some help with jquery draggable. I have a container, where the draggable item can move, but on top of it, there is a 'frame' which is scrollable and smaller than the container, and i need that frame to scroll, when cursor 'would leave' it
[12:21:10] <Hollusion> why is $(true).length not returning false?
[12:21:26] <taplar> why would it?
[12:21:35] <Hollusion> why is $(true) counted as a jquery object?
[12:21:48] <robertmaxrees> because it's wrapped in a jquery constructor.
[12:22:05] <robertmaxrees> $() returns an object that inherits from jquery,.
[12:22:15] <Hollusion> $('.someClassThatDoesNotExist').length will return false
[12:22:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:22:23] <robertmaxrees> it'll return 0.
[12:22:53] <Hollusion> i thought .length indicates whether the element exists or not
[12:23:01] <taplar> indirectly, sure
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> it returns the number of elements in the collectionm.
[12:23:09] <robertmaxrees> 0, which is falsy, is a value.
[12:23:35] <Hollusion> how can i detect $(true) then?
[12:23:41] <taplar> why wrap it?
[12:23:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:23:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:23:56] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be wrapping booleans in jquery.
[12:24:04] <robertmaxrees> you should only be passing DOM nodes to it, in fac.t
[12:24:12] <Hollusion> alright
[12:28:24] <robertmaxrees> out of curiosity, why are you passing a boolean to $()?
[12:28:39] <tilerendering_> I m making api calls to a session-enabled (via session cookie, not via token or anything else) API using javascript. how can I make my script retain the session cookie after logging in to the API and use that cookie for subsequent API calls ?
[12:28:57] <claytonzaugg> What would cause scrolling down and triggering a sticky menu to work on android devices, but on iOS, you have to wait for the screen to stop visually scrolling down or you have to take your finger off the screen?
[12:29:21] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ the js doesn't do that - the browser does.
[12:29:46] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg might have something to do with the way ios is trying to optimize mobile performance?
[12:30:40] <tilerendering_> robertmaxrees: hmmm
[12:30:51] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ that's how cookies work :
[12:31:01] <tilerendering_> I got you
[12:31:07] <tilerendering_> and I think it´s a cross-domain call problem
[12:31:21] <robertmaxrees> that's possible.  what's the actual issue you're having?
[12:31:26] <tilerendering_> the problem is that apprently chrome´s plugin to temporarily enable cross domain calls seems not to handle the cookies
[12:31:37] <tilerendering_> basically my session is lost after logging in successfully
[12:31:48] <tilerendering_> I m developing frontend + backend on localhost but with different ports
[12:31:56] <tilerendering_> and yes the browser thinks it is cross-domain
[12:31:59] <tilerendering_> it´s google chrome
[12:32:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:32:04] <robertmaxrees> all browsers would.
[12:32:10] <robertmaxrees> needs to be the same port, protocol, and domain.
[12:32:21] <tilerendering_> is there a way to disable this ?
[12:32:25] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:32:26] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[12:32:33] <robertmaxrees> why not set up some kind of routing system locally to map paths?
[12:32:44] <robertmaxrees> and let it proxy those connections for you.
[12:32:51] <tilerendering_> difficult, 2 IDE´s, 2 servers, not flexible with ports.
[12:32:54] <robertmaxrees> could use node with restify or something similar to handle that.
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> sure, but the local server could proxy to those ports.
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> so the browser sees what it wants to satisfy cors, but your machine handles the hard part.
[12:33:23] <tilerendering_> i d rather use a “sandboxed” browser with all kind of security disabled used only for deving purposes
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid that personally.
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> since you're not developing against a real-world case at that point
[12:33:50] <tilerendering_> robertmaxrees: sure, but the time needed to set this up is superior to what is needed to use a sandboxed browser for olely those ppurposes
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can disable CORS at the application level.
[12:33:58] <tilerendering_> CORS ?
[12:34:10] <tilerendering_> cross origin remote scripting
[12:34:11] <tilerendering_> ?
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> cross origin resource sharing.
[12:34:18] <tilerendering_> I m bad with abbreviations
[12:34:21] <tilerendering_> ok
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> and setting it up with the local proxy will give you a more indicative experiuence of the live platform.
[12:34:31] <tilerendering_> you mean at browser level
[12:34:32] <robertmaxrees> which is what you want.
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> and no.
[12:34:38] <tilerendering_> hm
[12:34:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean at the application level.
[12:34:45] <robertmaxrees> you configure your server differently.
[12:34:47] <tilerendering_> the application is multitier
[12:34:51] <tilerendering_> backend, frontend etc.
[12:35:01] <tilerendering_> but I guess you mean at frontend level
[12:35:03] <robertmaxrees> generally when we say "application" we mean the server-side.
[12:35:07] <robertmaxrees> and i mean at the server level.
[12:35:18] <tilerendering_> yes and what I m telling you is that I have 2 servers
[12:35:25] <tilerendering_> 1 web, 1 backend-api
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> that is irrelevant to emnabling cors.
[12:35:31] <tilerendering_> alrighty
[12:35:41] <tilerendering_> anyhow, I thank you for your advice, sincerely
[12:35:47] <robertmaxrees> the backend api server is the one you need to reconfigure - http://enable-cors.org/ there are majhor security implications in enabling cors
[12:35:48] <tilerendering_> but I guess I ll go for the simple solution for now
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> i would enable it for JUST the domain/port/protocol you need it available on.
[12:37:35] <tilerendering_> if there´s a fast and easy to do this, youre totally right
[12:37:49] <taplar> speed isn't the issue, security is
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[12:38:29] <taplar> the faster it runs broken the quicker you lose money
[12:39:30] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:39:35] <tilerendering_> taplar: understood, but right now losing time is main concern
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad concern.
[12:39:55] <robertmaxrees> i would never take security lightly.
[12:40:11] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you should be developing against an experience indicative of what your end users will have.
[12:42:15] <taplar> heh, i think this is why it's good to have developers segregated from sys admins.  programmers are all 'make it work!' and sys admins are like.....not that way
[12:49:54] <timwis> Hey guys, is there any way to use jquery like lodash, where each function is available standalone so you only pull in what you need? ie. var groupBy = require('lodash/groupBy')
[12:51:27] <taplar> trying to save space?
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> http://developer.telerik.com/featured/jquery-using-only-what-you-need/ if you want a basic overview, but I'd question the necessity of doing that in the first place.
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> different strokes i suppose.
[12:52:29] <taplar> i was going to say, your already using jquery, so in that aspect, you've already said memory isn't your #1 concern, lol
[12:54:56] <timwis> well, it's mainly for when I really only need to do one or two things, like find an element's sibling, or fire an ajax request, and vanilla JS is just too wonky
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.
[12:56:19] <timwis> ? i feel like I'm missing the joke
[12:56:19] <b-ot> hate you NO U
[12:56:36] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't see the point of using jquery at all then.
[12:56:47] <robertmaxrees> what browser support do you need?
[12:58:24] <timwis> i agree browser support is a strong feature of jquery. i just mean when all i need is to do an ajax request, i don't need to pull in the event binding and animation code, etc.
[12:58:44] <robertmaxrees> i guess i just don't see the big deal.
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> but OK :)
[12:58:49] <taplar> so why not write your own function that does it?
[13:00:39] <taplar> http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
[13:06:11] <tilerendering_> I need to programmatically enable jquery cross domain requests but to restrict the wildcard patterns to which they apply since I m using authentication. how do I do this in jquery programmatically ?
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ does this have anything to do with your question from before?
[13:06:39] <taplar> if javascript could bypass CORS then it wouldn't be a security feature
[13:06:51] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ are you getting an error about CORS headers?
[13:07:00] <tilerendering_> robertmaxrees: I got so far that I enabled session preservation
[13:07:25] <tilerendering_> now I m getting “A wildcard '*' cannot be used in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header when the credentials flag is true.”
[13:07:31] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery.
[13:07:32] <tilerendering_> last thing to bypass
[13:07:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a server-side thing.
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> on. how do I do this in jquery programmatically ?
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> [2016:02:15:10:06:30] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ does this have anything to do
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[13:07:44] <robertmaxrees> bad paste.
[13:08:15] <tilerendering_> are you sure it´s server ?
[13:08:29] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:08:42] <robertmaxrees> the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is a server-side concern.
[13:08:48] <tilerendering_> which would mean the web server, not the API server
[13:08:53] <tilerendering_> which is strange. I have none
[13:08:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> you're very confused.
[13:09:06] <tilerendering_> I am
[13:09:08] <robertmaxrees> your browser is making a request to an endpoint.
[13:09:13] <tilerendering_> yes
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> the browser is - not the server
[13:09:18] <tilerendering_> that endpoint is a backend
[13:09:23] <tilerendering_> an API
[13:09:24] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19743396/cors-cannot-use-wildcard-in-access-control-allow-origin-when-credentials-flag-i
[13:09:27] <robertmaxrees> the server that the browser is hitting is the one you need to modify.
[13:09:36] <tilerendering_> that server surely does _not_ respond like this
[13:09:45] <taplar> :)
[13:09:48] <tilerendering_> I know how that server responds
[13:09:49] <robertmaxrees> tilerendering_ then you're confused.
[13:09:59] <tilerendering_> maybe we re both
[13:10:06] <tilerendering_> I know how the backend is behaving
[13:10:08] <robertmaxrees> the browser is request a resource from a URI - you need to fix whatever is serving that URI.
[13:10:18] <tilerendering_> it wont make the frontend page javascript running in my browser behave like that
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:29] <tilerendering_> it´s a javascript thing.
[13:10:32] <taplar> nope
[13:10:34] <tilerendering_> there is _no_ web server
[13:10:38] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter.
[13:10:43] <robertmaxrees> there is a server that you are calling.
[13:10:51] <robertmaxrees> the js is calling an endpoint.
[13:10:55] <tilerendering_> that server does not respond like that
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:16] <taplar> check that SO link.  it gives the reason for that happening
[13:11:20] <tilerendering_> yes, it will not serve that error message
[13:11:25] <tilerendering_> anyhow, yeah, I ll check that link
[13:11:26] <tilerendering_> thx
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> because the error message isn't coming from the server.
[13:11:31] <tilerendering_> (sigh)
[13:11:40] <tilerendering_> yes, and guess where it´s coming from
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> the browser is telling you that the headers from the server are incorrect.
[13:11:53] <tilerendering_> ok
[13:11:55] <tilerendering_> got it
[13:12:07] <tilerendering_> and how are they incorrect ?
[13:12:59] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're using a wildcard for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin when the credentials flag is true.
[13:13:49] <tilerendering_> on the backend server side ? that would seriously surprise me. but if that´s what you mean, I ll doublecheck
[13:13:55] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean.
[13:14:00] <tilerendering_> strange stuff
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> rather.
[13:14:04] <tilerendering_> just a minute
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[13:14:24] <robertmaxrees> you're using a wildcard server-side.  you're setting the credentials flag to true client-side i'm guessing.
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you cannot combine those two.
[13:15:19] <robertmaxrees> this is easy to fix - simply change that header from your server to support a particular port, protocol, and domain. plenty of reading material out there about that :)
[13:16:18] <tilerendering_> hm. but robert.
[13:16:44] <tilerendering_> if I want my server to accept authenticated calls from random ip´s, how would I proceed ?
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> the call is originating from a page you host, correct?
[13:17:31] <tilerendering_> it could also be issued by a mobile device with a native client
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> that's the port, protocol, and domain you care about.
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to have the same issues.
[13:17:45] <tilerendering_> without a page as intermediate
[13:17:51] <robertmaxrees> that won't be cross-domain.
[13:17:53] <tilerendering_> hmmmm
[13:17:58] <tilerendering_> thanks
[13:28:40] <tilerendering_> ok I get it. I can do the calls from my Java testing applications, via same protocol, ip, and port. but no CORS issues. I do this from Javascript, it wont work. So it´s a Javascript thing. Anyhow, you would call it a “server” thing. The problem I see is that it will take me like at least 1-2 hours to get that server application (the API) to send the “correct” headers.
[13:29:28] <robertmaxrees> it's not a javascript thing.
[13:29:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a browser thing.
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> the browser is preventing people from making websites where it'd be trivial to read your email.
[13:30:12] <tilerendering_> youre right
[13:30:15] <tilerendering_> browser, yes
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> this is why i was suggesting the proxy earlier.
[13:33:37] <tilerendering_> mh. I have the page served from “http://localhost:63342/myWebFrontend” making calls to “http://localhost:8080/myAPI” - so basically I d have to make a proxy mape http://localhost:63342/myWebFrontend/apiProxyURL to http://localhost:8080/myAPI, right ?
[13:33:54] <tilerendering_> mape=map
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> sure, or you could have localhost:someOtherPort/myApi and localhost:someOtherPort/myWebFrontend both be "served" via that proxy to the browser.
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> then you're mapping those paths to the right ports server-side.
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> totally up to you.
[13:35:39] <tilerendering_> https://github.com/gr2m/CORS-Proxy
[13:36:04] <tilerendering_> simple, tight, made for exactly that
[13:36:06] <robertmaxrees> that's another option.  i would avoid using that for your project development.
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> and setup something that'll be more indicative of your final project.
[13:37:01] <tilerendering_> I could of course already configure an Apache as router with valid SSL certificate, a configuration I could also use for my prod environment
[13:37:30] <tilerendering_> but then I could also already use a VM template while I m at it ;)
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm just suggesting things that'll make it easier and faster for you to fix things in the long run.
[13:39:05] <tilerendering_> what lightweight http proxy would you suggest btw ?
[13:39:14] <tilerendering_> supporting https as well
[13:39:18] <tilerendering_> + some basic routing
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd maybe ask in #web
[13:39:26] <tilerendering_> thx
[13:57:26] <asdfowkw> Yoyo, anyone here?
[13:57:36] <robertmaxrees> 625 people are ;)
[13:57:41] <asdfowkw> haha
[13:57:42] <asdfowkw> okey then
[13:57:56] <asdfowkw> I'm having some jquery issues with datatables and maybe someone can help me out
[13:58:07] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions, just ask the,.
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> *them.
[13:58:23] <asdfowkw> I'm trying to find a way to put the pagination buttons in one of the existing table heads <th>'s. How would i do that?
[13:58:40] <robertmaxrees> check their docs first.
[13:58:50] <asdfowkw> thats where ive been the last hour :)
[13:59:16] <asdfowkw> i can move them with some dom options, but that puts them in a new div..
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> also: i might post in their forums.  somebody might know here, but it's not guaranteed since this isn't a datatables channel.
[13:59:47] <asdfowkw> I know, but i thought id try :)
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:00:04] <asdfowkw> already posted in their forums but trying to find a "live" answer somewhere ^^
[14:00:23] <robertmaxrees> just pointing you to a place you're more likely to get help.  that's all :)
[14:00:54] <asdfowkw> Ye im trying to find their channel name :)
[14:00:55] <asdfowkw> thanks
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> they don't have one.
[14:01:01] <robertmaxrees> :(
[14:01:05] <asdfowkw> oh =/
[14:01:09] <robertmaxrees> i've asked them to make one but they won't.
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, somebody might know something here.  good luck :)
[14:02:13] <asdfowkw> I'll guess I just have to bump and wait on their forum then :) thanks anyway
[14:43:49] <YamakasY> he guys!
[14:43:57] <YamakasY> haooy valentine, I hug you all!
[14:44:01] <YamakasY> *happy
[14:44:06] <YamakasY> even when it was yesterday ;)
[14:44:33] <taplar> heart is already broken man
[14:44:39] <taplar> u no care
[14:44:47] <YamakasY> taplar: I can heal it with Nutella!
[14:45:51] <YamakasY> I'm trying to select an input as checked there the name=X and the value is ofcourse variable... and I'm failing
[14:46:04] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:47:05] <YamakasY> taplar: http://www.konbini.com/en/files/2015/08/tumblr_nsdfej18MX1si0kwmo1_500-810x608.jpg
[14:49:49] <taplar> :/
[14:50:08] <taplar> i take it that's a formula for clogged arteries?
[14:50:29] <YamakasY> taplar: it's to fix your broken heart!
[14:50:32] * YamakasY hugs taplar 
[14:50:39] <taplar> it's just food man.  it's not love.  lol
[14:50:42] <YamakasY> ok, this is what I try todo                                 $('input[name="type"][value="' + urlParams[1] + '"]:checked');
[14:50:51] <robertmaxrees> right, so make a fiddle.
[14:51:05] <robertmaxrees> because that doesn't tell me what your markup is or what your object looks like :)
[14:51:40] <YamakasY> mh
[14:52:14] <YamakasY> the question is, should abobe normally select the input type with whatever is in urlParams[1] ?
[14:52:18] <YamakasY> *above
[14:52:30] <robertmaxrees> "the input type"?
[14:52:33] <YamakasY> I can fiddle it but I need to create a working fiddle which I don't have at all
[14:52:36] <YamakasY> yes
[14:52:40] <robertmaxrees> clarify.
[14:52:53] <YamakasY> I have an input that has name=type and value=candy
[14:52:55] <robertmaxrees> this is why a fiddle is helpful.
[14:53:03] <robertmaxrees> show us your markup and stuff.
[14:53:23] <YamakasY> that's kinda complex and huge code :)
[14:53:27] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[14:53:47] <robertmaxrees> it should only be a few lines on html and js.
[15:09:09] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: should be but the examples show several options :)
[15:14:53] <YamakasY> I think some other part in the code is blocking it
[15:19:58] <YamakasY> got it :)
[15:29:42] <YamakasY> mhh ok, I see my issue I split a #type=foo&detail=candy on =  so my first urlparam is foo&detail... should I split those again or can I split them @ the same time when I split on = ?
[15:33:43] <YamakasY> most examples do a regex or  second plrit, but I wonder if a second split is that good
[15:37:11] <taplar> split('&')[0].split('=')[1] ?
[15:38:48] <YamakasY> mhh is it not possible do start from the type and than count on [1][2][3] etc ?
[15:39:22] <taplar> sure there are other approaches
[15:40:07] <taplar> where are you getting that string from?
[15:41:25] <YamakasY> addressbar
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't it be great if there was a place we could put that code and share it and help you figure this out with functioning examples?
[15:41:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:41:57] <YamakasY> so I start like this 		url = url.substring(url.indexOf('#') + 1); urlParams = url.split('=');
[15:42:07] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[15:42:39] <YamakasY> ok, could be, I advise my friends also not to buy a Porsche ;)
[15:42:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[15:43:04] <robertmaxrees> did you have a good argument for why you'd do it that way?
[15:45:17] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: do you have a good argument why not to do so ?
[15:45:26] <YamakasY> you are stating something out of the bue
[15:45:28] <YamakasY> *blue
[15:45:36] <robertmaxrees> sure - it won't result in a terribly useful format.
[15:45:38] <taplar> because it's counter to the construction
[15:45:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xaLjmnsf/1/
[15:45:55] <robertmaxrees> here's one example that gives you a useful object.
[15:46:03] <taplar> key value pair mappings are usually keys joined to their values with = and then those joined with &.  so to undo that you work backwards
[15:46:43] <YamakasY> yap I agree there
[15:47:06] <YamakasY> it was not my code, I was debugging it :)
[15:47:12] <YamakasY> and seeing it more used
[15:47:16] <robertmaxrees> so now you have a way to construct an object that gives you a key/value pairs.
[15:47:30] <robertmaxrees> are you asking what url.substring(url.indexOf('#') + 1); urlParams = url.split('='); does, then?
[15:49:07] <YamakasY> it starts from the first [art it gets from #
[15:49:17] <YamakasY> indeed, and the pairs is good
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a really unusual way to do that.
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[15:50:37] <YamakasY> yeah
[15:50:56] <YamakasY> I see lots of "first choice" ways that are not that good
[15:51:25] <YamakasY> and you guys see that directly I need to know first why, I see it but I wonder why people do it like that
[15:51:48] <robertmaxrees> because they're unfamiliar with the other ways to do it.
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> or they really love method chaining for some reason.
[15:52:24] <YamakasY> hehe idneed
[15:52:25] <YamakasY> indeed
[15:52:32] <YamakasY> and I'm a smartass and wanna know WHY!
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> because they think it's "more readable.
[15:52:54] <taplar> curiosity doesn't equate being anal
[15:52:56] <YamakasY> I'm a better reviewer than coder :)
[15:53:01] <YamakasY> I can code but slowe
[15:53:04] <YamakasY> slower
[15:53:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't be a good reviewer without being a good coder.
[15:53:13] <YamakasY> at the end my code is much better most of the time :P
[15:53:17] <YamakasY> with some help tho
[15:53:30] <YamakasY> sure you can
[15:53:42] <YamakasY> just takes more time
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> you have no idea what constitutes good practice.
[15:53:54] <robertmaxrees> you're flying totally blind.
[15:54:24] <YamakasY> I reviews mostly PHP code and what I see there is most of the time... oh I know why they did that... they lost the overview
[15:54:43] <robertmaxrees> i still disagree with the original sentiment, but OK.
[15:55:21] <taplar> 'good' is relative anyway
[15:55:28] <YamakasY> taplar: indeed!
[15:55:47] <YamakasY> that is the issue, you need to collaborate and that is what I do during and afterwards
[15:55:56] <taplar> huh?
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> that has very little to do with your original statement.
[15:56:08] <YamakasY> heh some people call it scrum, I call it working together the way it should
[15:56:11] <taplar> lots of people work great solo
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:56:25] <YamakasY> yap, but they need a review, always
[15:56:35] <taplar> y?
[15:56:37] <YamakasY> or give feedback on what they did
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> code review has nothing to do with scrum.
[15:57:03] <YamakasY> depends on where you want want to know what is happening
[15:57:06] <YamakasY> and when
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:57:42] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: working alone huh ;)
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:57:51] <YamakasY> not even ?
[15:57:52] <YamakasY> oh
[15:57:59] * taplar is pairing right now
[15:58:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm pointing out that code review has nothing to do with scrum.
[15:58:05] <YamakasY> taplar: TMI!
[15:58:36] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: depends
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:58:41] <YamakasY> anyways
[15:58:59] <YamakasY> sure, but anyways
[15:59:02] <robertmaxrees> scrum about managing product development.
[15:59:17] <YamakasY> which contains codereviews or you don't know shit about what is being done
[15:59:19] <robertmaxrees> it's not really about the particulars of things like code reviews.
[15:59:25] <robertmaxrees> excuse me?
[15:59:41] <YamakasY> you != robertmaxrees
[15:59:59] <YamakasY> anyways, back to topics
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you realize that scrum is a fairly well defined concept, right?
[16:00:25] <YamakasY> i know some masters in it
[16:00:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean you understand it yourself though.
[16:01:01] <YamakasY> let's say they all tell it wrong than ;)
[16:01:20] <robertmaxrees> obviously they do since scrum doesn't really say anything baout code review.
[16:01:28] <robertmaxrees> project reviews and retrospectives, sure.
[16:02:28] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: are you controlled by scrum or are you managing it as a scrummaster ?
[16:02:40] <robertmaxrees> i've done both sides.
[16:02:43] <robertmaxrees> at multiple organizations.
[16:02:45] <YamakasY> that is not what I ask
[16:03:00] <YamakasY> doing it doesn't say you are a master
[16:03:01] <robertmaxrees> sure it is - you're trying to figure out how to discredit what i'm saying.
[16:03:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:03:12] <YamakasY> and controlled by it doesn't mean you know how it works either
[16:03:19] <YamakasY> indeed
[16:03:23] <robertmaxrees> sure i do.
[16:03:25] <YamakasY> because you think you are right
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> because I AM right ;)
[16:03:39] <YamakasY> are you a certified scrum master ?
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> are you?
[16:03:44] <taplar> lol
[16:03:53] <taplar> certified in an agile process...
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:04:02] <YamakasY> I don't have to, I know them and ask them when I need to
[16:04:11] <YamakasY> scrum is an agile proces :)
[16:04:17] <taplar> you missed the point
[16:04:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[16:04:39] <YamakasY> no
[16:04:47] <taplar> so your trolling
[16:04:50] <YamakasY> I missed your discroption that doesn't apply to me :)
[16:04:51] <YamakasY> no
[16:05:03] <YamakasY> *descranyways
[16:05:06] <YamakasY> cmkdsmc
[16:05:08] <YamakasY> anyways
[16:05:12] <YamakasY> this is a waste of time
[16:05:19] <YamakasY> and happens to much by coders ;)
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> what does?
[16:05:35] * YamakasY wanders off
[16:06:35] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:08:47] <robertmaxrees> i have been going back through so much music i listened to when i was a teenager and realized a lot of it works well for me as background music when developing.
[16:08:59] <taplar> cool
[16:09:04] <robertmaxrees> it's been awesome.
[16:09:32] <taplar> i make it a habit, possibly to my coworkers annoyance, to work in as many musical references as much as possible.
[16:09:41] <YamakasY> start on youtube and let it play... your whole life as a teenager comes by a remix
[16:09:57] <taplar> eh, if i'm going to playlist youtube i'm going to do dubstep
[16:10:07] <YamakasY> haha
[16:10:10] <robertmaxrees> i've never really been a big dubstep fan.
[16:10:15] <taplar> i'm addicted to melodic dubstep
[16:10:22] <YamakasY> I listen all what is there
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> i got done being in an 80's band a few months ago.  really glad i can start working on different stuff.
[16:12:24] <taplar> what's the new genre?
[16:12:51] <taplar> i saw your twitter pic (i think) and wondered if you did any r&b
[16:13:02] <robertmaxrees> not modern, no.
[16:13:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd love to work in some traditional stuff though.
[16:13:17] <robertmaxrees> we're just expanding out to whatever we want and goies over well.
[16:13:35] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: about that replace in your example with the # is it not better to remove all in front of it ?
[16:13:48] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY how are you getting the hash of the url?
[16:14:05] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I'm checking your example
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[16:14:19] <robertmaxrees> you should only have a string that starts with #
[16:14:49] <YamakasY> teah you just replace the # but nothing so the url becomes part of the pair
[16:14:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:14:53] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:15:00] <robertmaxrees> because you don't get the full url on first pass.
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> you grab the window.location.hash
[16:15:17] <YamakasY> mhh my console logs the whole url
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:15:28] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting the URL?
[16:15:35] <YamakasY> url.
[16:15:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:16:36] <YamakasY> I substring it
[16:16:40] <robertmaxrees> from what source?
[16:16:55] <robertmaxrees> are you grabbing the hash from the current window?
[16:16:56] <YamakasY> indexOf(#
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> because you'd just use window.location.hash for that.
[16:18:28] <YamakasY> ok
[16:22:56] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, but than it's splitted but I use it in which way best ?
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:23] <YamakasY> I mean, now I print [0] and [1] for each
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> i gave you the exact code you need.
[16:23:28] <YamakasY> yes
[16:23:39] <robertmaxrees> so then what do you need?
[16:27:21] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: let's say I need the first part from my first pair
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help.
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[16:27:48] <YamakasY> just sec
[16:27:50] <YamakasY> testing
[16:32:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I actually needs to use a part of the pair
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so step through my code.
[16:32:32] <YamakasY> so it's foo=bar and candy=sweet
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> you need foo and candy?
[16:32:46] <YamakasY> for an example
[16:32:50] <robertmaxrees> my code should show you how to get those quite easily.
[16:33:52] <YamakasY> yes but it gives them always for both
[16:34:02] <robertmaxrees> right, so you'd modify that to get what you need.
[16:34:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:34:31] <YamakasY> and not just get them all out and set them like part[1] and part[3] ?
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> you could do that very easily, as well.
[16:34:48] <YamakasY> I mean if foo = 0 and candy = 2
[16:34:51] <YamakasY> ok
[16:34:58] <YamakasY> was trying
[16:35:09] <robertmaxrees> wait what are part[1] and part[3] supposed to be?
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're munging this.
[16:35:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set form elements based on the URL?
[16:37:07] <YamakasY> yes I'm doing already
[16:37:23] <robertmaxrees> there are a few easy ways to tackle that.
[16:37:45] <robertmaxrees> the easiest would probably be to .forEach() through the object keys in the object i gave you earlier.
[16:37:57] <robertmaxrees> or .map() the split url into an array of "name" and "value" objects.
[16:39:01] <robertmaxrees> then again, the "right" way would be to do this server-side.
[16:39:03] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[16:39:06] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes I think map is better
[16:39:19] <YamakasY> can't be done serverside
[16:39:25] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[16:39:32] <YamakasY> because it can't simple
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:40:43] <YamakasY> but it would be best to have them set as [0] [1] [2] [3]
[16:40:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:40:54] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:41:00] <robertmaxrees> that's a really unreadable way to do that.
[16:41:11] <YamakasY> I know which position they have
[16:41:21] <taplar> positional based logic is fragile
[16:41:23] <robertmaxrees> but position is irrelevant and cannot be truly guaranteed.
[16:41:38] <YamakasY> it can in this case, it cannot change
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> actually it can.
[16:41:46] <robertmaxrees> and will.
[16:41:59] <YamakasY> people can change it but serverside it's checked
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> that's very fragile.
[16:42:12] <YamakasY> sure not
[16:42:15] <robertmaxrees> and it's easier to properly map things anyway.
[16:42:16] <taplar> is
[16:42:34] <arc_> why do it a fragile way when a non-fragile way is readily available and not harder to implement
[16:42:36] <YamakasY> I know where to check on @ serverside as I parse clientside what I get from serverside and recheck it again after it
[16:43:03] <taplar> u do
[16:43:05] <taplar> now
[16:43:08] <taplar> who else does?
[16:43:11] <taplar> and for how long?
[16:43:17] <YamakasY> huh ?
[16:43:21] <robertmaxrees> nobody will expect position to matter in the url.
[16:43:38] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason for key value pairings is because order doesn't matte.r
[16:44:29] <arc_> that and that keys have meanings while numeric indexes don't
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s0t5jg2e/2/ pretty basic.
[16:48:08] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY ^
[16:50:30] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah checking out!
[16:50:36] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[16:50:40] <YamakasY> yes
[16:50:46] <YamakasY> was getting a call
[16:51:08] <YamakasY> thanks!
[16:57:07] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: but I cannot get them as position at all ?
[16:57:15] <YamakasY> that would help me best in this case
[16:57:18] * YamakasY is testing out
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> you were just told by three people that is not a good solution at all.
[16:57:33] <robertmaxrees> you want it by name.
[16:57:57] <YamakasY> no I don't so that doesn't help me ;)
[16:58:05] <robertmaxrees> why do you want them positionally?
[16:58:06] <taplar> "collaboration" - having someone close by that you can ignore
[16:58:08] <YamakasY> I know what you mean but I can't :)
[16:58:34] <robertmaxrees> why can't you?
[16:58:40] <YamakasY> mhh let me recheck
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> taplar hahahaha
[17:00:07] <taplar> thought you might like that one
[17:00:14] <robertmaxrees> very astute
[17:00:53] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: mhh positionally is just easier in this case :)
[17:00:57] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:00:58] <YamakasY> can't help
[17:01:12] <YamakasY> because it saves me a lot of stuff I don't need to do
[17:01:14] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you a functioning example that shows you how to fill in form values by name,.
[17:01:23] <robertmaxrees> which is exactly what you said you're doing.
[17:01:32] <YamakasY> yes but I don't need tje foreach part
[17:01:38] <robertmaxrees> yes you do.
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> you want that.
[17:01:46] <YamakasY> yes in other cases
[17:01:52] <YamakasY> not in this one
[17:02:08] <robertmaxrees> how else are you planning on enumerating through each of these?
[17:03:07] <YamakasY> I just have 4 positions, nothing more
[17:03:26] <YamakasY> we are disussing something that is not needed :)
[17:03:31] <robertmaxrees> it's totally needed.
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> well you have everything you need there to figre the rest out yourself.
[17:05:38] <YamakasY> yeah doing so
[17:05:43] <YamakasY> thanks so far
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> but i'm going to really caution against doing that positionally.
[17:06:14] <robertmaxrees> and if all of your other code is already relying on it, i'd fix it.
[17:06:19] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise it's EXTREMELY fragile.
[17:09:39] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah it need more fixes otherwise
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> right.  which is the smart thing to do here.
[17:09:56] <YamakasY> mhh a pair must be split too ?
[17:10:02] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: later this week ;)
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> you know what?
[17:10:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your HTML and CSS look like.
[17:10:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't know hwat your backend looks like.
[17:10:32] <robertmaxrees> so until you meet me halfway, all I can do is give you that example ;)
[17:10:40] <YamakasY> yes that is good
[17:10:51] <YamakasY> but I need to optimize more using that, that is better
[17:11:02] <YamakasY> but not now as I canpt fit it into my timeschedule :)
[17:11:06] <YamakasY> *cannot
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't see what the backend order has to do with frontend form input names, but OK.
[17:11:38] <YamakasY> but the a part doesn't work like pair[0][1] becaus 1 prints the first character of the value
[17:11:47] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> (that's not how you do that.
[17:11:56] <robertmaxrees> )
[17:12:15] <YamakasY> no so I asked, do I need to split them again ?
[17:12:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you mean.
[17:12:22] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[17:14:31] <YamakasY> mhh can't get it into the fiddle: but splitPair[0] gives me the first pair but how to get the first element/part of that pair ?
[17:14:39] <robertmaxrees> fiddle.
[17:14:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:14:55] <YamakasY> he I was doing so but it doesn't print :S
[17:14:59] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do.
[17:16:01] <YamakasY> https://jsfiddle.net/s0t5jg2e/3/
[17:16:08] <YamakasY> I can console.log() it
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> that's in the .map()
[17:16:26] <robertmaxrees> don't be in the map.
[17:16:44] <robertmaxrees> but you'd use console.log() to print it.
[17:16:50] <YamakasY> yap
[17:16:56] <robertmaxrees> which will work.
[17:17:01] <YamakasY> yap
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> then what are you asking?
[17:17:20] <YamakasY> but how can I print one part of the pair as posisition ?
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:18:02] <YamakasY> yes, first part of the pair
[17:18:04] <YamakasY> or second
[17:18:16] <robertmaxrees> you just did it there.
[17:18:28] <YamakasY> no tht is the whole pair
[17:18:32] <YamakasY> not one part of it
[17:18:48] <YamakasY> it prints 1 2 and not 1
[17:18:49] <robertmaxrees> splitPair[0] where you're referencing it there is just the "name" part of the pair.
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> (this is why the fiddle is invaluable
[17:20:23] <YamakasY> ok, but than it still outputs both names, I want one :)
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[17:20:31] <YamakasY> it does
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> it outputs each one separately.
[17:20:40] <robertmaxrees> one at a time.
[17:20:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you want.
[17:20:45] <YamakasY> yes but can I catch one of them as position ?
[17:20:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that means.
[17:21:18] <YamakasY> I get all names
[17:21:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> one for each pair.
[17:21:34] <YamakasY> but if I want to get the 3rd or the second name only ?
[17:21:46] <robertmaxrees> keyValues[3]
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> keyValues[3].name, for instance
[17:22:00] <YamakasY> k
[17:22:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> that's all in the fiddle.
[17:22:12] <YamakasY> I need to change that to named ones for sure :)
[17:22:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:22:48] <YamakasY> ye sbut that is looped
[17:23:08] <robertmaxrees> right, but it still shows you how to access the name of an index.
[17:23:19] <YamakasY> yap
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd really encourage you to run through a javascript tutorial btw.
[17:24:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd learn a lot and it'd help you understand things like this much faster,
[17:24:09] <YamakasY> yeah
[17:24:19] <YamakasY> ok, to be quite short in it. it does not "array" it
[17:24:25] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> you have an array.
[17:24:32] <robertmaxrees> and array of objects.
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> *an
[17:28:40] <YamakasY> I want for an example only array 1 and name only
[17:28:45] <YamakasY> that is my issue
[17:28:47] <robertmaxrees> try
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried.
[17:29:35] <YamakasY> I'm not testing in the fiddle
[17:29:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.  sorry then!
[17:29:46] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[17:39:20] <Mark____> my website still throws console error “Cannot read property 'ui' of undefined” , i think it’s related to jquery ui, but is there any good way to dbug this? i really need to use this jquery plugin. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today
[17:39:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting $ is undefined.
[17:39:51] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you're trying to use jquery before it's defined.
[17:40:07] <robertmaxrees> in fact, i don't see where you're including jquery at all.
[17:41:15] <robertmaxrees> erm, looks like you have some strange conditionals to load a particular version,but it looks like you're setting noConflict
[17:42:13] <elonmusk> Hi guys, how i can show a border just 2s ?
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> add it and then remove it 2 seconds later.
[17:42:43] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout is usually what you want.
[17:43:47] <Mark____> robbyoconnor:
[17:43:54] <Mark____> robertmaxrees: are you talking to me?
[17:43:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:44:05] <robertmaxrees> i was.
[17:44:20] <Mark____> initially, that was exactly what’s causing the problem.
[17:44:24] <Mark____> but i fixed it.
[17:44:27] <robertmaxrees> good.
[17:44:49] <Mark____> the codes are included in the jquery.ui.datepicker-ko.js
[17:44:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:00] <Mark____> but now i don’t know what to do
[17:45:04] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm still getting $ is undefined
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[17:45:13] <robertmaxrees> can't really help you.
[17:45:23] <Mark____> ...okay.
[17:45:42] <elonmusk> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:45:46] <robertmaxrees> try fixing that and then somebody will be able to assist you Mark____
[17:50:37] <elonmusk> anyone know this error ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/295eee0a3dcf351e85d5
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use setTimeout.
[17:51:00] <robertmaxrees> it wants a function reference.
[17:51:17] <robertmaxrees> right now you're running that code immediately and then the return is getting assigned.
[17:51:48] <robertmaxrees> the easiest fix is to wrap that in an anonymous function.
[17:53:21] <elonmusk> I drag and drop and when the user submits a bad element I want the border blinking 2s
[17:53:40] <robertmaxrees> ....
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> i just explained the fix.
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> oh and your $(this) won't be what you think it is.
[17:54:07] <elonmusk> yes I saw
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> most people fix that by doing var $this = $(this); before the timeOut and using $this inside of it instead.
[19:23:30] <nsosa> hi all, can someone explain what I'm doing wrong here, why the second link does not work? https://jsfiddle.net/tzasam2z/5/
[19:25:02] <robertmaxrees> because it doesn't exist when you run the binding.
[19:25:09] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener instead.
[19:25:19] <nsosa> Hi robert!
[19:25:24] <nsosa> how do I do that?
[19:25:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tzasam2z/6/
[19:26:19] <robertmaxrees> read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[19:26:44] <nsosa> thank you!!
[19:26:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:26:55] <nsosa> I was struggling with that thanks a lot
[19:27:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.  those links should explain the concept.
[19:29:36] <nsosa> robert this doesn't work $('#jumbotron').on('change',':regex(id,^id_form-[0-9]-audio_file$)', function(event){
[19:29:41] <nsosa> could it be because of the regex?
[19:29:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> give them a class.
[19:30:10] <robertmaxrees> the second argument needs to be a standard selector - like what you'd pass to $()
[19:30:22] <nsosa> but what if there are many different selectors?
[19:30:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to give them a shared class.
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> is it the same action for all of them?
[19:30:41] <nsosa> yes
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, they should have a shared class.
[19:30:52] <nsosa> on change do something, but they are different, the id is differnt
[19:31:00] <robertmaxrees> right, give them a class that is not.
[19:31:13] <nsosa> they are all inside the class jumbotron
[19:31:17] <nsosa> jumbotron
[19:31:26] <robertmaxrees> then you can do .jumbotron a
[19:31:40] <robertmaxrees> you can pass any selector as that second arg.
[19:31:41] <nsosa> it's an input
[19:31:48] <nsosa> can I do .jumbotron :input ?
[19:31:54] <nsosa> is a file input
[19:32:01] <nsosa> I want to do something when it changes
[19:32:03] <robertmaxrees> are you aware of what a selector is?
[19:32:20] <nsosa> sort of
[19:32:36] <nsosa> ok, I will read a little bit more
[19:32:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:32:40] <nsosa> and take your advice
[19:32:41] <robertmaxrees> check out those links.
[19:32:47] <nsosa> thxs
[19:44:08] <shudon> hi all :) one of my guys wants to use async attribute of script element to speed up page load time. of course, he didn't account for race conditions. the obvious thing to do is not use async for scripts that have interdependencies. does the jquery community employ any other techniques here?
[19:44:37] <robertmaxrees> require :)
[19:44:43] <robertmaxrees> or something else to manage dependencies.
[19:45:14] <shudon> robertmaxrees: oh, sure. that would work :)
[19:45:17] <shudon> any other suggestions?
[19:46:43] <robertmaxrees> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/ here's some good info.
[19:47:09] <robertmaxrees> also, i might look at the defer attribute.
[20:33:11] <jquery949> Can someone help me with adding a class to a link on hover?
[20:33:17] <jquery949> <script>     $(function(){       $("a:hover").hover(         function(){           $(this).addClass("animated shake");         });     });   </script>
[20:33:21] <jquery949> some reason this isnt working
[20:33:29] <jquery949> but it will work for paragraphs...
[20:38:23] <arc_> jquery949 umm .. don't you want to just select 'a' instead of 'a:hover'
[20:38:26] <arc_> i've never tried that before
[20:38:44] <jquery949> still doesnt work
[20:38:51] <jquery949> it adds the class but it wont shake it :/
[20:39:24] <arc_> what is the css
[20:40:27] <jquery949> umm
[20:41:07] <jquery949> @keyframes shake {   from, to {     -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);     transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);   }    10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% {     -webkit-transform: translate3d(-10px, 0, 0);     transform: translate3d(-10px, 0, 0);   }    20%, 40%, 60%, 80% {     -webkit-transform: translate3d(10px, 0, 0);     transform: translate3d(10px, 0, 0);   } }
[20:41:15] <jquery949> im using animate.css
[22:08:17] <printForever> I'm trying to show TIP if the user does not click a link
[22:08:31] <printForever> but I want to use it for input fields too
[22:09:07] <printForever> page loads, person hasn't clicked anywhere, hasn't wrote anything in the input field, the input field was never focused // SHOW HINT
[22:09:25] <printForever> I know I must use setTimeout
[22:09:45] <printForever> but I'm not sure how to check if the element hasn't been clicked/focused
[23:52:33] <irmoathlete> sup all
[23:58:18] <phelix> how could I do something like     var seelector = '#' + $(this).parents('.servicesPop').attr('id');
[23:58:43] <phelix> but basically have that become the samething as var selector $('#thatid');
[23:58:47] <phelix> if that makes sense
