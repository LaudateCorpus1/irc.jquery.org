[01:28:17] <tash> can I somehow get the value of the nearest <input> ?
[01:29:31] <tash> I tried .closest() but that doesn't seem to be working.  Either it doesn't work for input, or I'm doing it wrong.
[01:47:35] <itsgokul> how can i get region-data named value from div
[01:47:47] <itsgokul> <div region-data="234">
[01:54:41] <dni> itsgokul
[01:54:54] <itsgokul> found it
[01:54:55] <dni> $(sel).attr("region-data")
[01:55:08] <itsgokul> now i have string id=234
[01:55:24] <itsgokul> i want 234 how can i?
[01:58:04] <itsgokul> how to split
[02:01:27] <Uhkis> string has a split() method
[02:02:53] <itsgokul> when i use split("=") on id=234 it returns id,234
[02:03:10] <itsgokul> i want 234 only
[02:06:10] <Uhkis> then select that key from the array
[02:08:59] <itsgokul> it works
[02:35:53] <ussher_> is there a simple way to get all of the classes that exist in children of the currently selected element?  $(this).html() is all the html, but i only really want the class names that exist inside that html if its easy.
[02:37:12] <slax0r> not exactly sure what you want, but maybe $(this).find(".className").each(function () { html += $(this).html() }); ?
[02:41:17] <hellyeah> hey
[02:42:21] <ussher_> just trying to filter out the class names before sending it off to server-side for processing.  wanting to lookup if the server side has any info stored on any of the class names so wanting to pull them out instead of sending all the html
[02:54:02] <ussher_> got it now, thanks slax0r

[06:18:40] <jqups> Hello, I have 3 documents (full html code) and want to find 2 separated elements on them, how do I do it on 1 each function?
[06:19:58] <jqups> http://pastebin.com/p6EQu6dn
[06:28:48] <jomofcw> Is there another way to set the property ID of an object to the return of a function than "parameters={};parameters[myFunction()]=myValue;" please ?
[06:35:18] <decx> wat`?
[06:41:34] <jqups> my issue was solved
[07:25:55] <dewz0r> heyas
[07:26:07] <dewz0r> im building a site where i use an .get xml in the onload of the page. However i also need to be able to insert information from this xml file when my eventtrigger goes off.. Any idea how i could do that?
[09:18:54] <bongjovi> can anyone help, i'm trying to combine: $elem.off(); $elem.next().off(); $elem.prev().off(); into a single line, is that possible?
[09:19:39] <taplar> huh?
[09:19:51] <decx> do you have a full collection cached already?
[09:20:20] <bongjovi> decx: was that a question for me?
[09:20:38] <decx> maybe
[09:20:41] <taplar> lol
[09:20:49] <hellyeah> bongjovi:  can this work https://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[09:20:57] <decx> no
[09:20:58] <shoky> bongjovi it's possible, but don't
[09:21:07] <taplar> are you off() the same event handler for all three elements?
[09:21:11] <bongjovi> yeah
[09:21:31] <decx> elem.add(elem.next()).add(elem.prev())
[09:21:43] <taplar> ^ but it's really not readable
[09:21:47] <decx> but if you already have the whole thing cached i'd slice that collection
[09:21:48] <shoky> oh the same off()
[09:22:29] <taplar> personally i might do elem.parent().children().off()
[09:23:08] <taplar> provided you don't care that it's take off of all the siblings
[09:23:41] <bongjovi> i guess that would be similar to $elem.siblings().andSelf().off();?
[09:24:11] <hellyeah> andSelf
[09:24:11] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:24:11] <bongjovi> or $elem.siblings().addBack().off(); even
[09:24:13] <hellyeah> bongjovi:  what about parents?
[09:24:41] <taplar> bongjovi: similar but parent().children() would get more than just those three
[09:24:56] <taplar> it'd get all the siblings, including the starting point
[09:25:16] <bongjovi> yeah, i just need the current, previous and next at present
[09:25:45] <taplar> yeah, go with decx's then
[09:26:01] <bongjovi> cool, will give it a try, thanks
[09:26:16] <decx> add or slice?
[09:26:20] <decx> ^^
[09:26:37] <taplar> wait, decx, how would the last prev() work now that it has two elements in the stack?
[09:27:07] <decx> it's just a reference relative to element to the object
[09:27:52] <bongjovi> yeah, that seems to work well
[09:28:17] <bongjovi> thank you
[09:29:09] <Gloomy> Hey
[09:29:09] <Gloomy> I'm just getting started with jquery
[09:29:15] <Gloomy> Say I select some elements and need to store their contents for later use, what's the best way to do so?
[09:29:32] <taplar> store the object in a var that you can later reference
[09:29:33] <bongjovi> like var $elem = $('.selector'); ?
[09:29:43] <decx> depends on the element
[09:30:27] <Gloomy> Sure, but then if the original element changes (for instance, user input) the referenced object will also change right?
[09:30:35] <taplar> yep
[09:30:51] <decx> it's just a pointer to that memory
[09:31:29] <Gloomy> Can I do $elem = $(".selector").clone() ?
[09:31:45] <taplar> yes
[09:31:57] <Gloomy> If so, how do I later access a specific element? (They all have the same class, but different id's)
[09:32:16] <decx> filter is one way
[09:32:23] <taplar> you'd either reference it by that $elem variable or have to know the context in which to find it
[09:32:35] <decx> but an id is already a direct reference so it doesnt really matter
[09:32:40] <taplar> ^
[09:33:52] <taplar> Gloomy: have you read over learn.jquery.com ?
[09:34:12] <Gloomy> Hum sure. What I mean is, how do I access specifically one of the cloned elements?
[09:34:30] <shoky> which one?
[09:34:44] <taplar> oh, like decx said, $elem.filter();
[09:35:22] <taplar> i'm curious why your cloning them though
[09:35:56] <Gloomy> What I need to do is, basically, I have a form with some sections that can take more than one value, so I need to put a "+" button that allows to copy the section of the form
[09:36:12] <taplar> gotcha
[09:36:21] <shoky> <select> and <textarea> don't necessarily save the user's input/selection btw
[09:36:44] <shoky> when cloned, that is
[09:36:57] <decx> if they have ids you have to remove them
[09:37:10] <decx> or extend with an index
[09:37:59] <Gloomy> That's the thing. I need to 1. clone the original section (so it's empty from any user input) 2. change the id and 3. add it after the already present sections
[09:38:18] <taplar> do you have to have an id?  can a class not work?
[09:39:02] <Gloomy> For now I have a '.duplicable' class that surrounds the duplicable sections and inside that section some input fields with id's
[09:39:34] <taplar> not really what i asked
[09:39:41] <Gloomy> And I need id's for use with <label> elements
[09:40:02] <taplar> ah
[09:40:04] <decx> you can stick inputs inside a label then you dont
[09:40:40] <Gloomy> decx : hm, didn't know, will check that out
[09:40:51] <taplar> would save you from having to change the ids
[09:47:24] <Gloomy> Ok, I found a way. Thank you :-)
[10:05:46] <islalobo> Using typeahead is there a way to grab the string that the user is typing? https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[10:06:19] <islalobo> Trying to update our autocomplete function to call api to external db if their are less than a certain number of results
[10:11:19] <taplar> $('.typeahead').typeahead('val');
[10:11:41] <taplar> https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/jquery_typeahead.md <-- look under api usage
[10:17:35] <Gloomy> Another little question. If I have selected an element; how do I select its children? I'm reading the documentation but I'm still a bit confused with selectors. $( ' [something] :first-child') matches the first child of 'something', but how do I select the first child of another jquery object?
[10:18:34] <taplar> children() gets all immediate children
[10:18:59] <taplar> you can find('> selector') also off of it
[10:19:23] <Gloomy> So, simply $target.children()?
[10:19:37] <taplar> if you want them all
[10:19:44] <Gloomy> Yup. Ok; thanks!
[11:06:41] <islalobo> Hello, still struggling to get the query value while using typeahead and bloodhound. We are trying to create an autocomplete field and want to make a call to external db when query results are less than a certain number. This is my bloodhound engine and typeahead script: http://kopy.io/SFYDm and this is our autocomplete function: http://kopy.io/YFZxB
[11:14:35] <albedoa> https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/jquery.boilerplate.js is there a reason to pass `options` to the Plugin function instead of extending the settings in the original function and then passing the settings to Plugin?
[11:22:21] <shoky> albedoa: as they say, they want the $.fn.* method to be a "really light wrapper". doesn't really matter
[11:22:38] <albedoa> thank you shoky
[11:27:11] <taplar> if you passed in the settings all of them would share the object
[11:27:31] <taplar> so if you wanted to change the settings of an individual plugin you'd have an issue
[11:27:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/o7ecu8cu/
[11:33:36] <albedoa> hmmm
[11:36:31] <Devrim> Does anyone know how I can retrieve the characters in the last part of this url? https://www.blabla.com/something/somemore/abc345678
[11:37:39] <taplar> window.location.href.split('/').pop() maybe
[11:37:48] <Devrim> thanks, will give it a try
[11:37:48] <jak2000> hi all
[11:38:04] <jak2000> i want detect the change into tabs(bootstrap) ehre my fiddle, not working, any advice? thanks
[11:39:15] <Devrim> that worked for me, thanks taplar
[11:39:20] <taplar> cool
[11:41:07] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/77jsLtp7/1/
[11:42:31] <taplar> so what's not working?
[11:42:47] <taplar> oh, the alert?
[11:42:48] <jak2000> when you click on TRES tab
[11:43:00] <jak2000> not display an alert
[11:43:02] <decx> there's no data-id
[11:43:39] <jak2000> decx: is for me? <div class="tab-pane fade" id="home4">
[11:43:49] <taplar> data-id
[11:44:07] <taplar> verbatum
[11:44:11] <jak2000> ok
[11:44:26] <decx> which isnt on there anyway
[11:44:33] <decx> because the id is on the tab and this is the link
[11:45:38] <jak2000> ok done: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/77jsLtp7/3/
[11:45:54] <albedoa> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/1uj8x9xo/ i'm having trouble finding where that would be a problem in a real world solution due to scope
[11:46:15] <jak2000> thanks
[11:46:34] <albedoa> taplar i see what yours is doing but can you describe how that might translate?
[11:46:40] <taplar> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/77jsLtp7/4/
[11:47:23] <decx> also is that name a will and grace reference
[11:48:06] <taplar> albedoa: can you make your fiddle functional?
[11:49:08] <albedoa> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/1uj8x9xo/1/
[11:49:23] <albedoa> it seems like the problems you demonstrate are real but wouldn't matter here
[11:50:32] <taplar> right, cause your doing the extending of the settings
[11:50:45] <taplar> instead of just taking in settings and using them verbatum
[11:50:54] <taplar> which i though was what you were asking about why they were not doing that
[11:51:45] <albedoa> taplar thanks for walking me through it
[11:53:26] <jak2000> tabla thanks
[11:53:29] <jak2000> taplar
[11:54:03] <taplar> just another approach, :)
[12:04:44] <taplar> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/77jsLtp7/5/
[12:14:35] <Duikb00t-home> Hello
[12:14:55] <taplar> aloha
[12:15:05] <Duikb00t-home> Has someone idea what the best approach is to add more fieldsets based on this piece I already made? https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/
[12:15:20] <Duikb00t-home> The thing it it should be formed dynamically so I can easily grab it to store it in a database.
[12:15:29] <Duikb00t-home> Should I add somewhere [] ? :)
[12:15:32] <Duikb00t-home> Hi taplar ;)
[12:17:56] <taplar> ok, so you can do it with different approaches
[12:18:11] <Duikb00t-home> I could add also an id to them
[12:18:24] <Duikb00t-home> input_firstname_blah_0  input_firstname_blah_1 input_firstname_blah_2
[12:18:40] <taplar> what kinda layout are you after?
[12:18:55] <taplar> cause if you can group the buttons together with their associated fieldsets you wouldn't have to do that
[12:20:09] <Duikb00t-home> Something like this taplar: https://www.pastery.net/sehsqv/
[12:20:37] <taplar> ok, so the buttons and fieldsets are going to be vertically stacked?
[12:21:01] <Duikb00t-home> Does that matter currently?
[12:21:30] <taplar> your desired end result will change the possible solutions you can use
[12:21:35] <taplar> which is why i asked what your after
[12:21:42] <Duikb00t-home> yes but I don't know yet : )
[12:21:47] <Duikb00t-home> as long as it works and its dynamic
[12:22:09] <taplar> ok, so we'll go down the vertical stacking layout for now and you can rehash later if you want to change it, :)
[12:22:16] <Duikb00t-home> OK :D
[12:22:18] <Duikb00t-home> Awesome
[12:22:36] <taplar> so one approach would be to encapsulate your button and your fieldset in another tag, like div or span or something
[12:23:08] <taplar> then when you click the button, you'd either find your parent and then find your fieldset, or find your sibling fieldset
[12:23:16] <taplar> most of your logic would change to use classes
[12:23:22] <taplar> to make it generic
[12:24:14] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/8qu8br1w/1/ that way?
[12:24:49] <Duikb00t-home> Not that this is a part of a form where the same functionality should be re-used in an other fieldset for receiving other data.
[12:24:52] <Duikb00t-home> note*
[12:25:01] <taplar> one sec
[12:26:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/2/
[12:28:34] <Duikb00t-home> Hmmm
[12:28:46] <Duikb00t-home> Bit confused now
[12:29:04] <taplar> so ask, :)
[12:29:31] <Duikb00t-home> the orange button should only be used to togle : show/hide all fieldsets ( all children )
[12:29:40] <taplar> aaaaah
[12:29:43] <Duikb00t-home> The green button should add the duplicate of the fieldset below it
[12:30:13] <Drewery> add some margin and padding to the fieldset... geeezzz... :P
[12:30:27] <Duikb00t-home> And should I replicate the HTML ? Or should I do that with only JS?  ( Who's currently using a non-js browser )
[12:30:36] <Duikb00t-home> Drewery: :P it's just technical
[12:30:42] <Duikb00t-home> geeezzz :D
[12:30:46] <Drewery> I know I was just kidding :)
[12:30:48] <Drewery> lol
[12:30:53] <Duikb00t-home> :D haha
[12:37:18] <taplar> maybe something like: https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/4/
[12:38:24] <taplar> i'm going to go get some food real quick, brb
[12:38:44] <Duikb00t-home> Wow nice that's awesome
[12:38:49] <decx> gotta kill or index the ids
[12:39:02] <Duikb00t-home> yes?
[12:39:13] <decx> yes
[12:39:46] <Duikb00t-home> Should I add an id to them?
[12:39:53] <Duikb00t-home> ( the back-end language I am using laravel ( php ) )
[12:40:52] <decx> the clones need unique names and ids
[12:43:32] <decx> then again the ids dont do anything so just remove them
[12:43:58] <decx> still the same name will just make posting the whole thing weird
[12:44:54] <decx> either collect them all separately in an array name="child_lastname[]" for example and then separate them on your backend, or actually create indexed names when you clone them
[12:44:58] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/8qu8br1w/5/
[12:45:05] <Duikb00t-home> Well indeed
[12:45:17] <Duikb00t-home> When I just add a [] for every name?
[12:45:31] <decx> that would be one way
[12:45:39] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/8qu8br1w/6/
[12:45:44] <Duikb00t-home> Like that
[12:45:45] <decx> then you get an array of these fields on your backend
[12:45:55] <Duikb00t-home> indeed :) Perfect
[12:48:34] <Duikb00t-home> Cleaned it up a bit: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/8qu8br1w/7/
[12:49:23] <Duikb00t-home> Thanks a lot taplar_lunch & decx
[12:50:53] <taplar> btw, you'll probably want to clear out the input values on the clones elements
[12:51:13] <Duikb00t-home> oh indeed
[12:51:28] <decx> just clone on load already
[12:51:39] <taplar> ah, and clone off the clean copy
[12:51:43] <decx> yep
[12:51:51] <Duikb00t-home> Can I force that?
[12:52:33] <wfq> hi guys
[12:53:03] <taplar> Duikb00t: it'd just be something done around when you did the hide()
[12:53:05] <taplar> at the top
[12:54:02] <Duikb00t-home> hmm
[12:54:45] <wfq> I am just going mad and don't know what else to do. I just want my jquery validation to ignore all fields that are not visible and have the class '.ignoreWhenHidden'. I have this rule: '.ignore :not(:visible)'. However I have elements withing a "div" with "display:none" that keep getting validated
[12:54:56] <wfq> Any idea?
[12:56:48] <taplar> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/8qu8br1w/10/
[12:57:55] <taplar> wfq: '.ignoreWhenHidden :not(:visible)' ?
[12:58:10] <wfq> When I run alert ($("input [name='individualPreviousCity']").is (':visible')) for one of the elements that I want to be ignored it tells me that is not visible
[12:58:15] <wfq> taplar?
[12:58:24] <taplar> is that the rule you have exactly?
[12:58:35] <wfq> taplar, yes as shown here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24554332/jquery-validation-plugin-ignored-elements-get-validated
[12:58:52] <taplar> try removing the space between the class and the :not
[12:59:53] <wfq> taplar, bloody hell
[12:59:58] <taplar> spaces in css selectors matter.  spaces denote nesting
[13:00:00] <wfq> what an idiot I am
[13:00:17] <decx> doesnt validate already ignore hidden inputs?
[13:00:19] <wfq> sure, sorry. thaks a lot
[13:00:33] <taplar> no clue
[13:00:35] <wfq> I meant that I did not realise about the space until youmentioned
[13:01:02] <wfq> It seems to work now
[13:01:04] <decx> pretty sure i had a form that i validated where you could show and validate a delivery address field set optionally
[13:02:08] <wfq> taplar, thanks a lot again
[13:02:20] <taplar> glad it worked
[13:08:03] <wfq> taplar, glad you pointed me out such a silly mistake. cheers

[13:29:20] <taplar> decx: you can do slice on a jq object?
[13:29:45] <decx> yes there's a jq variant of slice
[13:29:58] <taplar> does it return an array or a jq object?
[13:30:13] <decx> cant remember
[13:30:16] <decx> yes
[13:30:40] <decx> jq
[13:31:46] <taplar> does it error if the end goes beyond the range?
[13:33:41] <taplar> doesn't seem to, interesting
[13:35:54] <taplar> so post submitted, boom
[13:38:26] <decx> it's got negative index goodness, dont know about roundabout like eq
[13:38:51] <decx> probably not

[14:58:56] <z1haze> you can check if a function is available by doing $.fn.function right?
[14:59:16] <robertmaxrees> generally.
[14:59:37] <z1haze> alright, welp thats my problem then
[14:59:48] <robertmaxrees> but you generally shouldn't need to do that.
[15:00:13] <z1haze> well i wasnt getting a typical function is not defined error
[15:05:00] <z1haze> what would generally cause a jquery plugin to not work with require?
[15:05:05] <z1haze> i mean what is the actual issue
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> it binds to the global jquery object instead of revealing a module like require needs.
[15:05:51] <z1haze> well i have a global jquery object ive even included it with a script tag
[15:06:04] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[15:06:08] <z1haze> i have 7 other jquery plugins required working correctly.
[15:06:15] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:06:19] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[15:06:36] <z1haze> how
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> it could be that the plugin revals a module correctly but because you're loading jquery globally it may not work.
[15:07:03] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways that can break.
[15:07:11] <robertmaxrees> you should check out the shim setup instead.
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> so require includes jquery for you when you need it as a dep for a plugin.
[15:07:26] <z1haze> it doesnt even have a package.json
[15:07:38] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't have anything to do with require fwiw.
[15:07:49] <z1haze> you said check out the shim setupo
[15:07:55] <robertmaxrees> for require, yes.
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> package.json is for npm.
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> and node projects in general.
[15:08:19] <shoky> z1haze you always fail to mention you're using browserify, not requirejs or whatever
[15:08:22] <z1haze> the only shim im using is for jquery itself
[15:08:30] <shoky> that's.. the most important fact to say
[15:08:33] <robertmaxrees> wait what.
[15:08:34] <z1haze> oh is it?
[15:08:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not using require?
[15:08:44] <z1haze> well i am
[15:08:48] <z1haze> require('module')
[15:08:52] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:08:55] <shoky> that's not "using require"
[15:09:06] <z1haze> so using require() isnt using require?
[15:09:08] <shoky> z1haze just say browserify. how many times do we need to go over it
[15:09:08] <z1haze> odd
[15:09:10] <robertmaxrees> "using require" means "i'm using require.js"
[15:09:17] <robertmaxrees> http://requirejs.org/
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> this is what people think of when you say "i'm using require"
[15:09:28] <z1haze> ok then
[15:09:36] <z1haze> im using browserify with require()
[15:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you're just using browserify.
[15:09:55] <z1haze> ok
[15:10:10] <z1haze> sorry about that
[15:10:26] <robertmaxrees> it's all good, but that's a pretty critical detail
[15:12:01] <z1haze> alright then, well using browserify, i just include jquery with a script tag and expose it in my shim
[15:12:15] <z1haze> it is working correctly for 7 other jquery plugins
[15:12:25] <robertmaxrees> what plugin isn't working then?
[15:12:58] <z1haze> iCheck
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/q/33068667
[15:13:30] <robertmaxrees> first comment here.
[15:13:50] <z1haze> i already have browserify shim
[15:13:52] <z1haze> that doesnt really help
[15:14:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:14:12] <robertmaxrees> alright then.,
[15:14:13] <z1haze> want to see my package.json?
[15:14:35] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/30CS8C1
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ dunno then
[15:15:37] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in #browserify.  seems liek you've had a lot of questions abotu how to use it.
[15:16:47] <shoky> might wanna say what the actual problem is, too ...
[15:17:42] <z1haze> hmm well i fixed it
[15:17:51] <z1haze> i switched from the minified file to the normal file and its working..
[15:18:46] <z1haze> i dont see how that can have anything to do with me or udnerstanding how browserify works.. but maybe
[15:19:10] <robertmaxrees> your question really doesn't have to do with jquery, but with browserify, that's all.
[15:19:15] <shoky> z1haze: i see you're only exporting jquery globally as $  but most plugins would look for a global jQuery  not a global $
[15:19:23] <shoky> maybe that has to do with problems you've had
[15:19:23] <robertmaxrees>  sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[15:19:24] <robertmaxrees> [2016:04:05:12:16:48] <shoky> might wanna say what the actual problem is, too ...

[15:19:44] <shoky> ;p
[15:19:53] <z1haze> why did you do that
[15:20:02] <robertmaxrees> bad copy/paste.
[15:20:29] <z1haze> ah shoky you mean i should export as both $ and jQuery?
[15:21:08] <shoky> z1haze yes or even just jQuery, but uhh you said you're also including jquery with a separate <script> ?  that doesn't sound good
[15:21:27] <z1haze> thats how jquery is included
[15:21:32] <z1haze> with a script
[15:21:38] <z1haze> my package.json just exposes that
[15:22:18] <shoky> donno what you mean
[15:22:23] <z1haze> found it here: first solution "exposing" section http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24835954/configure-a-generic-jquery-plugin-with-browserify-shim
[15:22:49] <z1haze> basically you can include js stuff in script tags
[15:23:25] <z1haze> like jquery by itself, for faster loading, or whatever
[15:25:35] <shoky> hm so you don't have jquery in node_modules ?
[15:26:05] <z1haze> i think its in there but im not using it
[15:26:12] <z1haze> im referencing a cdn currently
[15:26:28] <shoky> i see... donno, i'd prolly go for shimming, not exposing something already global
[15:26:53] <z1haze> well after reading that answer its what shimming is
[15:27:46] <shoky> with shimming you don't include it in a separate <sript>
[15:27:59] <shoky> and nothing has to be global
[15:28:06] <z1haze> ok
[15:28:20] <z1haze> well from what you recommended earlier, is there a way to make the jquery be for both variables jQuery and $
[15:28:30] <shoky> you're doing the "exposing" thing, not shimming, as far as i can tell
[15:29:30] <shoky> i donno, probably
[16:03:19] <robertmaxrees> i love new relic sometimes.
[18:07:07] <Monorail> Hey, with an array of promises, is it possible to perform an action when all of the promises have finished executing their callbacks? (not using when)
[18:08:00] <Monorail> I'm trying to push to an array in the promises' done() but my when executes before the array contains anything
[18:11:47] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:12:19] <robertmaxrees> so not when the promise resolves or rejects, but when the registered handlers finish executing?
[20:22:58] <jak2000> if i have a checkbox remember password, how to save the password? in a cookie? with jquery can do?
[20:25:12] <cannap> no
[20:25:30] <cannap> server should handle this
[20:25:44] <cannap> you can make a remembet cookie
[20:26:10] <cannap> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244882/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-remember-me-for-a-website
[20:49:32] <jak2000> cannap ok reading
[20:49:40] <jak2000> i see the password in the cookie!!! whyyyy
[20:49:43] <jak2000> how to protect?
[20:50:27] <cannap> what
[20:50:29] <cannap> ah
[20:50:36] <jak2000> understand me?
[20:50:39] <jak2000> is possible protect?/

[20:52:23] <cannap> and 3. i mean in 2. wtf
[21:56:19] <rhizome> don't put the password in a cookie
[22:07:09] <_August_> i need an opinion, does this look sloppy? http://pastebin.com/fuCLsxWy
[22:11:08] <hartleyDev> Hey Guys/Gals, I am trying to make an ajax post call from a http page to an https end point and on success the cookie does not get set on the browser. Any clues?
[22:11:38] <hartleyDev> I do see the cookie but it is not being set
[22:17:47] <tinylobsta> is there a reason why this snippet would be causing two distinct HTML tags to be created, as opposed to nesting as it should?
[22:17:48] <tinylobsta> $('#category-select').append('<a class=activeClass href=' + url + '><li class="top-selector">' + title + '</li></a>');
