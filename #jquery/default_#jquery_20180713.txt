[02:13:04] <obert> hi
[03:16:26] <coolternet> hi everybody
[04:23:50] <OnceMe> is it possible to listen onChange for a element tag?
[04:23:57] <OnceMe> so when element tag changes, it triggers function?
[04:24:47] <Cork> no
[04:25:08] <OnceMe> hmm
[04:25:08] <Cork> generally elements doesn't cause events
[04:25:20] <OnceMe> is there any way to check when element tag change
[04:25:24] <OnceMe> for example when title changes?
[04:25:40] <OnceMe> I want to trigger update when title changes, and polling may cause performance issues
[04:25:55] <OnceMe> <div class="myclass" title="watch for changes">
[04:26:02] <Cork> can't the code doing the change tell you?
[04:26:18] <OnceMe> not really, no
[04:26:24] <OnceMe> I know it sounds weird, but it cant
[04:26:35] <OnceMe> its third party app, requires much more effort to digg inside that lib
[04:26:37] <Cork> is the update done by loading a blob of html and replacing the old html?
[04:26:52] <Cork> or is the actual attribute updated?
[04:27:27] <OnceMe> sec
[04:28:55] <OnceMe> attr is updated
[04:29:19] <Cork> do you know what the app is calling to update the title?
[04:29:33] <Cork> cause you can wrap that call and trigger on it
[04:29:56] <OnceMe> I dont know
[04:29:59] <OnceMe> it requires investigation
[04:30:00] <OnceMe> hmm
[04:30:34] <OnceMe> cant I maybe go with: $('#myEl').on('change', function() { alert( $(this).find(":title").val() ); }); ?
[04:30:45] <OnceMe> not sure if myEl will trigger when title updates
[04:30:48] <OnceMe> could make a jsfiddle sec
[04:31:19] <Cork> something like (function() { var oldTitleChange = app.titleChange; app.titleChange = function() { var result = oldTitleChange.apply(app, arguments);/* do stuff */ return result; } })()
[04:31:30] <Cork> you can't
[04:31:44] <Cork> cause change is for input field changes, and only for use input actions
[04:32:10] <Cork> events are only for user actions, not for code to detect other codes
[04:32:49] <Cork> as a last option, but it will be messy you can try using MutationObserver
[04:32:55] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[04:33:34] <Cork> but i would quite strongly recommend breaking down what the app is doing and from there see if you can find an api call you can wrap with what i explained up there
[04:34:11] <Cork> cause anything else will normally be fragile (so is wrapping, but then it is at least only when changing version)
[04:34:26] <OnceMe> thanks
[04:34:27] <OnceMe> let me check something
[04:35:25] <OnceMe> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/Lj678b1p/4/
[04:35:29] <OnceMe> offtopic kind of
[04:35:35] <OnceMe> in console, I get only one update brm
[04:35:40] <OnceMe> am I logging it wrongly?
[04:36:27] <OnceMe> nvm
[04:36:28] <OnceMe> SetInterval
[04:38:03] <Cork> (please don't do data polling if that is what you're looking into...)
[04:38:08] <OnceMe> no
[04:38:12] <OnceMe> just for example
[04:38:17] <Cork> k
[04:38:27] <OnceMe> its really hard to dig inside what triggers call update :(
[04:38:33] <OnceMe> Ill try your method with observer
[04:38:37] <OnceMe> any example on how it?
[04:40:27] <Cork> how it what?
[04:41:23] <coolternet> Anyone can help me ? im using simpleCartJS and i need to add a condition... this is my code : https://fpaste.ca/55h its work good on jsfiddle but not on my website
[04:42:35] <Cork> coolternet: if it doesn't work on your site but it does in jsfiddle it most likely is either cause you're missing ready wrapping
[04:42:39] <coolternet> i have error : Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (   and its a if line
[04:42:53] <Cork> uh ah...
[04:43:39] <Cork> coolternet: you should never give undefined to val()
[04:43:50] <Cork> input fields work with strings, and strings only
[04:44:18] <Cork> anything else gets typecast to strings
[04:44:53] <Cork> so .val(undefined) is the same thing as .val('undefined')
[04:46:11] <Cork> and the if case around it doesn't actually make any sense at all...
[04:47:30] <coolternet> i need to check if domain value exist ... and if not exist, remove input + label from my table
[04:48:00] <Cork> domain value exists in what?
[04:48:07] <coolternet> button
[04:48:10] <coolternet> wait
[04:49:25] <Cork> sounds like you should definitely be able to make a fiddle about that
[04:49:40] <coolternet> https://fpaste.ca/5Rn
[04:50:13] <coolternet> idk if a fiddle can work fine with some js but i thing codepen can work fine
[04:54:44] <Cork> coolternet: the jsfiddle doesn't have to actually execute (depending on the question)
[04:55:11] <Cork> but from what you've asked it doesn't sound like it should be a problem to reproduce the parsing error...
[05:09:00] <coolternet> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7pq8vfxz/9/
[05:09:12] <coolternet> jsfiddle work very fine lol
[05:10:37] <Cork> except none of the code you asked about is in the jsfiddle...
[05:15:40] <coolternet> this is working version : http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/408589/   and this is my result in dev : http://jsfiddle.net/7pq8vfxz/23/
[05:16:46] <Cork> ya, and again setting an input field to undefined is not supported by form fields
[05:17:00] <Cork> they only supports string values
[05:17:27] <coolternet> undefined mean no value is set on the button
[05:17:34] <Cork> no it does not
[05:17:35] <coolternet> do you check the button ?
[05:17:45] <OnceMe> Cork, I mean for watching changes on tag
[05:18:19] <Cork> OnceMe: i linked you to the page about it
[05:18:39] <coolternet> on hosting button domain: 'mon-domain.com',  and on vps button i dont have it sooo js set to undefined because no value is set
[05:19:03] <Cork> except you will get the wrong effect
[05:19:17] <Cork> as undefined will be typecased to "undefined"
[05:19:23] <Cork> what you want is just ''
[05:19:50] <Cork> (and the if case around it makes no sense either, as it will always be truthy as $() is truthy)
[05:20:09] <coolternet> when i put '' , its automaticly set to undefined
[05:20:24] <Cork> ...
[05:20:48] <coolternet> i think u do not understand when i mean ...
[05:21:12] <Cork> i think you're are extremely confused...
[05:21:41] <Cork> cause you're doing things that are obviously wrong, and you talk about things in ways they don't work
[05:22:17] <Cork> undefined is a javascript value, the dom don't have it
[05:23:39] <coolternet> i just want to remove it from my "table" if no value exist
[05:24:05] <coolternet> Is it possible or not ?
[05:24:37] <Cork> what part?
[05:24:50] <Cork> you've asked about parsing error then not shown the parsing error
[05:25:02] <Cork> then asked about checking a value but not shown the value to check...
[05:25:20] <Cork> it isn't exactly mind readin hq channel...
[05:26:03] <coolternet> i think u kidding me ...
[05:27:15] <OnceMe> Cork, is MutationObserver known for any kind of performance issues?
[05:27:31] <OnceMe> would it be the same affect, as if I would use polling to check if element updated instead of MutationObserver ?
[05:27:37] <OnceMe> effect*
[05:33:21] <Cork> OnceMe: you will have to handle all type of modifications that can result in the title change
[05:33:44] <Cork> and yes you will have to process quite a lot of updates
[05:34:02] <Cork> and yes it can depending on what you want to check be costly
[05:34:27] <Cork> and is why i recommended to only use it if you absolutely don't have another choice (and quite often you do)
[05:34:49] <OnceMe> Cork, I can only observe one element
[05:34:59] <OnceMe> that should reduce costlyness of it I guess?
[05:35:21] <Cork> OnceMe: if the element is never replaced (and the title updated by that) yes
[05:35:43] <Cork> then you could limit it to attribute updates on that one element
[05:36:07] <Cork> but you would have to check the pages code to make sure it only updates it by modifying the attribute on the dom element
[05:36:57] <Cork> cause if it ever does (jquery) .html() on a parent or (native js) innerHTML = [html string] that mutation observer will be lost
[05:37:22] <Cork> and you will miss that change and all later changes
[05:38:09] <OnceMe> ok
[05:39:05] <OnceMe> Failed to execute 'observe' on 'MutationObserver': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
[05:39:33] <OnceMe> observer.observe($(selector), config);
[05:39:51] <OnceMe> I print console.log("Node "+ $(selector)); and get [object Object]
[05:39:59] <OnceMe> so object is found, not sure why it shows that error
[05:43:24] <Cork> $() returns a jquery object
[05:43:31] <Cork> you need to get the raw dom element
[05:43:40] <OnceMe> how to get that?
[05:43:40] <Cork> so $(selector)[0]
[05:43:45] <OnceMe> what I thought :P
[05:43:59] <Cork> (also note make sure it only matches one element)
[05:44:03] <OnceMe> thanks
[05:44:05] <OnceMe> yap I did
[05:44:23] <Cork> if it is an id it does that by default
[05:44:34] <OnceMe> its by input and name
[05:44:38] <OnceMe> but name is unique
[05:44:51] <Cork> input?
[05:44:59] <Cork> didn't you say it was div and title?
[05:44:59] <OnceMe> $(input[name=uniqueName)
[05:45:16] <Cork> input changes cause events so...
[05:45:22] <OnceMe> oh yes
[05:45:23] <OnceMe> damn
[05:45:57] <Cork> $('input[name="name"]').on('input', function() {})
[05:45:58] <OnceMe> so $('.uniqueClass')[0] ?
[05:46:25] <Cork> what selector you use doesn't matter, what element you're working with does
[05:46:35] <OnceMe> ok
[05:46:36] <OnceMe> one more thing
[05:46:41] <OnceMe> how observer works?
[05:46:50] <OnceMe> I mean, I can only imagine it uses internal polling to check if object is changed
[05:47:01] <OnceMe> whats different from me using setInterval and checking it, too?
[05:47:07] <Cork> observer is implemented in the browser
[05:47:20] <Cork> you ask it to notify you when it mutates the dom tree
[05:47:33] <OnceMe> so, I dont see any performance issues
[05:47:40] <OnceMe> it would be an issue, if bunch of stuff in dom changes
[05:47:46] <OnceMe> but I only watch one css unique class
[05:47:50] <OnceMe> and thats it, so I guess its fine?
[05:48:05] <Cork> except how many selectors you use doesn't matter
[05:48:25] <Cork> how many dom _elements_ you watch matters
[05:48:53] <Cork> if you use 500 ids or loop a class matching 500 elements is the same thing
[05:49:42] <OnceMe> hmm
[05:49:47] <Cork> and then it also depends on how many changes the dom element (and depending on what filters you give to the observer) tree
[05:49:50] <OnceMe> observer went crazy and showed me 10k lines
[05:49:52] <Cork> affects how heavy it is
[05:49:55] <OnceMe> that title is updated, when in fact its not
[05:50:14] <Cork> most likely cause you gave it give me all changes
[05:50:23] <Cork> check the mutation filter
[05:50:39] <OnceMe> else if (mutation.type == 'attributes') {
[05:50:47] <Cork> that isn't the filter
[05:50:53] <OnceMe> && mutation.attributeName == 'title
[05:51:03] <Cork> again that isn't the filter
[05:51:11] <OnceMe> how to apply filter then?
[05:51:12] <Cork> the filter isn't code
[05:51:25] <Cork> check where you define the observer
[05:51:37] <OnceMe> in a callback
[05:51:43] <OnceMe> cause I want for element to render
[05:52:13] <Cork> no, when you define the observer you give it a node and what to update you about
[05:52:37] <Cork> like attributes, childList, subtree...
[05:52:46] <Cork> THAT is the filter
[05:52:47] <OnceMe> thats in config yes
[05:53:18] <OnceMe> so what to apply there?
[05:53:26] <Cork> what do you think?
[05:53:50] <OnceMe> attributes: true, childList: false, subtree: false ?
[05:54:01] <Cork> or just { attributes: true } ya
[06:01:01] <OnceMe> Cork, great
[06:01:02] <OnceMe> thanks!
[06:01:22] <Cork> don't forget to check the attribute name :)
[06:01:26] <OnceMe> can you tell me again, difference between MutationObserver and simple setInterval(), whats the performance benefit of MutationObserver
[06:01:45] <OnceMe> Cork, what do you mean by that?
[06:01:55] <Cork> mutationobservers tells the browser to tell you when it does dom changes related to this element
[06:01:56] <OnceMe> I simply get it with $('.uniqueCssClass)[0] ?
[06:02:09] <OnceMe> should I check if exists?
[06:02:11] <Cork> setintervals checks every x miliseconds if there has been a change
[06:02:27] <Cork> OnceMe: yes
[06:02:31] <OnceMe> ok, but how the browser knows that its updated?
[06:02:40] <Cork> uh, it does the changes?
[06:02:54] <OnceMe> and who does changes with setInterval?
[06:03:17] <Cork> still the browser, but you're not asking the browser to tell you when it changes
[06:03:26] <Cork> you constantly check over and over again
[06:03:37] <OnceMe> cool
[06:04:04] <OnceMe> if ( $( ".uniqueCssName" ).length ) { // observer callback etc } correct?
[06:04:10] <Cork> ya
[06:04:22] <Cork> personally i prefer .length > 0
[06:04:40] <OnceMe> cool thanks
[06:04:42] <Cork> but it is just me not liking implicit typecasting (for readability)
[06:04:53] <Cork> and actually
[06:05:17] <Cork> you could do if(length == 1) { bind } else { error is 0 or more then 1 }
[06:05:40] <Cork> depending on if you care if there are more then one and you only binding the first one
[06:07:47] <Cork> you could also do it as $(selector).each(function() { bind }) and handle all through that
[06:08:18] <Cork> (this in the loop would be the raw element)
[06:55:45] <EdwardIII> so promises are obviously the wrong approach here if i want the console to fill up every time i click the button: https://jsfiddle.net/rupybgq7/34/
[06:56:34] <EdwardIII> what's a better approach? callback? event trigger?
[06:57:37] <cheenu1234> how to find which type of browser in jquery syntax
[06:58:20] <EdwardIII> cheenu1234: would window.navigator do? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator
[06:59:38] <cheenu1234> i am asked ..which type of browser is i am run the web application?
[07:03:18] <cheenu1234_> hii guys
[07:03:41] <cheenu1234_> how to use this chat site?
[07:22:07] <pavonia> Most important: Don't close the chat tab :x
[07:22:51] <OnceMee> Cork, MutationObserver breaks on IE11
[07:24:24] <OnceMee> oh
[07:24:32] <OnceMee> it seems I defined var config, where its used elsewhere
[07:24:35] <OnceMee> can I use let config = {}
[07:24:39] <OnceMee> so that inside of that scope?
[07:35:16] <Cork> you don't need to use a variable at all
[07:35:23] <OnceMee> indeed
[07:35:24] <Cork> just give the object to .observe
[07:41:30] <OnceMee> ok
[07:41:33] <OnceMee> seems something else is off
[07:50:55] <OnceMee> hmm https://pastebin.com/BzXve4Gj
[07:51:03] <OnceMee> when I remove second and 4th line
[07:51:06] <OnceMee> it works fine in IE11
[07:51:09] <OnceMee> with that code, it doesnt
[07:51:32] <AdamPDotty> 2nd line is empty
[07:51:39] <AdamPDotty> 4th is a bracket
[07:51:52] <AdamPDotty> brackets don't like to live alone
[07:52:02] <AdamPDotty> ah it changed
[07:52:04] <AdamPDotty> strange
[07:52:54] * AdamPDotty guesses you use the variable mutation at some place afterwards
[07:53:05] <AdamPDotty> but still, it is local
[07:54:20] <AdamPDotty> did you try without the var? Maybe MSIE does not know syntax.
[07:54:32] <AdamPDotty> meaning the "var" in for
[07:55:15] <AdamPDotty> hmm and was not ye olde style for (var i in is) ...
[07:57:00] <AdamPDotty> Did you check the console and got a "mutationsList is not iterable"?
[07:57:11] * AdamPDotty has got lots of ideas today.
[08:08:22] <Rockwood> <div class="oneClass twoClass"> i want do like this by .addclass(); is possible?
[08:08:50] <Cork> you want what?
[08:10:14] <Rockwood> actually i have right now this--> <div class="oneClass">, i wanna add another class without remove old like this--> <div class="oneClass twoClass">
[08:10:32] <Cork> that would be what addClass is for ya
[08:11:32] <Rockwood> $( selector ).addClass( "oneClass twoClass" ); am right?
[08:11:50] <Rockwood> is the correct syntax?
[08:11:51] <Cork> no you just list what you want to add
[08:12:01] <Cork> you don't need to list all of them
[08:12:03] <Rockwood> hows?
[08:12:09] <Cork> just list the class you want to add
[08:12:55] <Rockwood>  $("oneClass").addClass( "twoClass" ); am right?
[08:13:07] <Cork> no...
[08:13:22] <Rockwood> what do you mean by list here?
[08:13:43] <Cork> the addClass is right there, but the selector is wrong
[08:15:02] <Rockwood> <td class='tds'>  i want to add on this
[08:16:29] <Cork> Rockwood: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/#selecting-elements-by-class-name
[08:19:19] <Rockwood>  ".oneClass" am right?
[08:19:27] <Cork> just try it
[08:19:32] <Rockwood> okay thanks \
[08:19:38] <Rockwood> let me chk
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> what a morning
[17:58:48] <_AleX_> Hello, how to get the content of the summernote object from onBlur callback ?
[18:00:44] <robertmaxrees> what content?
[18:01:05] <robertmaxrees> talking about https://github.com/summernote/summernote ?
[18:02:55] <robertmaxrees> _AleX_ https://summernote.org/deep-dive/#onchange looks like they explain how here.
[18:03:28] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: it's not explaining how to get the html content
[18:03:36] <_AleX_> from the callback
[18:04:30] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[18:04:40] <robertmaxrees> do you want the contents or the element?
[18:04:50] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: inside the onblur function, i've try $('.summernote').code() and i've a error : code() is not defined
[18:05:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing .code() as a valid method on their docs.
[18:05:42] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to get?
[18:06:40] <_AleX_> just the content that was writed
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the onFocus and onBlur callbacks have similar args to onChange
[18:07:40] <_AleX_> it's for call a ajax function that update the content when you leave the editor (onBlur works perfectly for that)
[18:08:23] <_AleX_> i'm trying
[18:09:45] <_AleX_> i've try: the first argument is the event object
[18:09:52] <_AleX_> and the second is undefined
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, then?
[18:10:42] <_AleX_> i dont have understand
[18:10:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[18:10:57] <robertmaxrees> use this to make a test case so I can see your code
[18:11:33] <_AleX_> i try
[18:12:59] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: the text is inside the event object
[18:14:23] <_AleX_> but inside target, inside chlidNodes.NodeList at the 0 key ... how i access it ?
[18:16:21] <_AleX_> Robdgreat: how can i see methods of an object ?
[18:16:32] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: : how can i see methods of an object ?
[18:18:46] <robertmaxrees> get that fiddle made?
[18:26:08] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: i dont have try
[18:26:18] <_AleX_> i'm trying to find an other way
[18:26:58] <_AleX_> i dont know how to use jsfiddle and not the time to learn, i'm trying to find the solution
[18:27:13] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* one sec then
[18:28:05] <_AleX_> get the content of the summernote editor from a onBlur() function is a classic need
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> "a classic need"????
[18:28:39] <_AleX_> sure ! for doing a ajac update for example
[18:28:46] <_AleX_> s/ajac/ajax/
[18:29:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/fhgj49wd/1/
[18:30:05] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: and how to integrate external css and js like summernote ?
[18:30:23] <robertmaxrees> they're already in there.
[18:30:32] <_AleX_> ok i try
[18:30:39] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/3ADFp9B.png
[18:33:09] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: done.
[18:33:28] <robertmaxrees> now save and share the link.
[18:33:41] <robertmaxrees> hit the "update" up tope and then share out the new URL
[18:34:36] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/MrZIVoq.png
[18:35:09] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: summernote is not supported
[18:35:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, forgot to link in the js
[18:35:46] <_AleX_> https://jsfiddle.net/fhgj49wd/6/
[18:36:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fhgj49wd/8/
[18:37:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fhgj49wd/9/

[18:37:52] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:37:56] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with $(this)?
[18:38:33] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: i want the string "coucou" inside onBlur
[18:39:04] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: sorry
[18:39:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean the value of the input?
[18:39:17] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: i want the string "<h1>coucou</h1>" inside onBlur
[18:40:08] <_AleX_> the html content after the modification maded with summernote
[18:42:09] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21921976/pulling-edited-text-from-summernote-textarea
[18:45:31] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: dont work
[18:45:48] <_AleX_> https://jsfiddle.net/fhgj49wd/17/
[18:46:08] <_AleX_> from onBlur() callback
[18:46:15] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:46:20] <robertmaxrees> $('#summernote')
[18:46:39] <_AleX_> i search since 20 mn ...
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not your div id.
[18:46:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:46:57] <robertmaxrees> try $('.summernote')
[18:47:02] <_AleX_> :)
[18:47:37] <_AleX_> not working ... you can try too on jsfiddle
[18:47:48] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying.
[18:48:20] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: call a ajax function for writing in a remote db the data typed by the user
[18:48:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I asked lol
[18:48:34] <robertmaxrees> show me the js you're saying doesn't workj.
[18:49:21] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: look at the javascript console, the Value field is undefined or an empty jquery object
[18:49:42] <robertmaxrees> in https://jsfiddle.net/fhgj49wd/17/ ?
[18:49:53] <robertmaxrees> because i just explained why.
[18:50:43] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to do #summernote as a selector, but that's not what you want.
[18:52:29] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: i'm following the doc
[18:52:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:52:52] <robertmaxrees> you're using a different selector in your code.
[18:53:16] <_AleX_> just find how to print the html content typed inside summernote in the onBlur callback and i will be happy
[18:53:22] <robertmaxrees> so you need to modify new things to work with what you already have.
[18:53:28] <robertmaxrees> dude I already told you what the issue is.
[18:53:34] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to do $('.summernote')
[18:53:44] <robertmaxrees> err, $('#summernote')
[18:53:47] <robertmaxrees> but you want $('.summernote')
[18:53:56] <robertmaxrees> select the class and not the ID - bam, done
[18:54:59] <_AleX_> robertmaxrees: works perfectly, thank you !
[18:55:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:55:10] <_AleX_> https://jsfiddle.net/fhgj49wd/21/
[18:55:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:20:21] <jak2000> robertmaxrees? are you there?
[19:20:39] <robertmaxrees> along with over 300 other people.
[19:20:45] <robertmaxrees> don't pm me :(
[19:22:10] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 did you have a question?
[19:57:00] <scetian> Hi guys. I have used Jquery UI tooltip to show on a button now client wants it to be responsive so that it shows on all screens. Can anyone please help?
[19:57:16] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:57:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the issu8e?
[19:57:20] <robertmaxrees> *issue
[19:57:32] <scetian> https://videovalidate.allinalldevelopers.com/email/show/1
[19:57:48] <robertmaxrees> ..
[19:57:52] <scetian> as you can see in this link I have initialized a tooltip
[19:58:03] <robertmaxrees> where?
[19:58:14] <scetian> but its not responsive. Is there any way to make it responsive using jquery?
[19:58:27] <scetian> its above the mic button
[19:58:28] <robertmaxrees> when you say "responsive", what are you expecting?
[19:58:46] <scetian> the tooltip to show on all devices at the same place
[19:59:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you want a different way to activate it?
[19:59:49] <robertmaxrees> when should it show on mobile devices?
[20:00:10] <scetian> it is showing on mobile device. Its just not showing on the right place
[20:00:27] <robertmaxrees> ah
[20:00:41] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/6iU9lma.png so that's the issue?
[20:01:03] <scetian> yep
[20:01:21] <robertmaxrees> your issue is your .custom-tooltip-styling
[20:02:08] <scetian> if I remove this class then the tooltip shows up at a totally different place
[20:02:25] <robertmaxrees> right - you want to use the position option to control that ionstead.
[20:02:27] <robertmaxrees> *inst4ead
[20:02:31] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahaha
[20:03:04] <robertmaxrees> anyway, don't use css to do that - have the liubrary manage it.
[20:03:49] <scetian> I tried but jquery ui is not handling it properly
[20:03:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:04:11] <robertmaxrees> woops
[20:04:20] <robertmaxrees> so it's not at all possible that you might be using it incorrectly?
[20:05:51] <scetian> yeah its totally possible because i have custom css included too
[20:05:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:06:09] <scetian> but the thing is I tried removing it too.. still no good
[20:06:19] <robertmaxrees> because you need to do both.
[20:06:26] <robertmaxrees> remove it and tweak the position.
[20:11:48] <robertmaxrees> try { my: "center top", at: "center top" } for the position option.
[20:11:50] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[20:11:56] <robertmaxrees> kill the custom CSS you made.
[20:14:17] <scetian> ok
[20:14:21] <scetian> testing
[20:16:21] <scetian> no good
[21:54:15] <forgotmynick> whats up white people
