[09:06:52] <dskull> does anyone know off hand if .submit(){ ..validation... return true; } is broken with ios/safari? I can get everything to work aside from the form submission itself.
[09:51:44] <dskull> Yea I can't seem to get $('myform').submit() to work at all on ios. Works fine everywhere else
[14:41:23] <admin123> would you use this plugin?
[14:41:24] <admin123> https://maxfavilli.com/jquery-tag-manager
[14:41:49] <admin123> I'm trying to build a tagging UI. my backend is django + django-taggit if anyone has experience with this.
[15:19:25] <Cork> admin123: i usually use this reference when deciding about plugins: would you be ok with taking over the plugin (for the sites you us it in) if it was dropped
[15:19:46] <Cork> read the code and think about it from that perspective. If the answer is no, then i wouldn't use it
[15:20:18] <Cork> cause it either means it is overly complex, or badly written
[15:21:10] <Cork> (and no one else can really answer you if you should use a plugin or not, only you can answer that)
[15:21:26] <Cork> (well possibly, to not use, but not the other way around)
[17:23:09] <arthur_rainbow> Hi
[17:23:09] <arthur_rainbow> I've got a question related to jquery-ui resizable. How can I know using jquery whether an object is resizable or not ? I can't figure out exactly how to find all of the resizable object, and so how to destroy them.
[18:31:19] <ColdKeyboard> Any suggestion for plotting library that allows you to plot machine/device usage by hour for each day that is compatible with jQuery? I need to plot for example that on x day, machine was used from 1-3PM and then again from 5-8PM and so on for each day...
[18:32:41] <ColdKeyboard> I'm looking at Plotly.js and Charts.js but can't seem to figure out if these libraries support multiple Y values/ranges for same X point
