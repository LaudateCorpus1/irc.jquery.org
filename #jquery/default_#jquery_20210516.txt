[03:23:48] <snake-venom> wonder if there any way to get if <td> text changed// any event in jquery
[03:23:49] <snake-venom> ?
[03:26:43] <pavonia> I think there was a plugin for mutation observers
[04:20:12] <snake-venom> wonder if there any way to get if <td> text changed any event in jquery
[04:20:54] <robertmaxrees> you asked that a while ago
[04:21:03] <robertmaxrees> depends'
[11:33:47] <t2mkn> robertmaxrees actually closures thing is working fine. there was some problem with my code. i am taking this approach just to keep some common name vars private to it as there are many such parts. its just to keep things separate and simple from one another.
[18:19:59] <robertmaxrees> t2mkn they'd be "private" by virtue of just using the doc ready - no need to create a superfluous scope with an iife.
[18:53:25] <sydbarret> what if my li is like 12 lines. How can i do this  $("#menu").append('<li><a href="#">New list item</a></li>');
[18:53:57] <sydbarret> a better way is to save the li html in a variable
[18:54:07] <sydbarret> and then do .append (variable)  ?
[18:55:58] <pavonia> You possibly want to build the element as DOM object, not from strings, i.e. $("<li>").append($("<a>").attr(...)) etc.
[18:57:04] <sydbarret> what about the classes?
[18:57:12] <sydbarret> the attr are the classes?
[18:57:39] <sydbarret> or the values?
[18:59:06] <pavonia> .attr() sets attributes with values on the elements
[18:59:26] <pavonia> e.g. $("<a>").attr("href", "#")
[19:59:13] <sydbarret> pavonia ok it works but it doesnt stay
[19:59:30] <sydbarret> because I added while clicking a link that goes to another page
[19:59:54] <sydbarret> but i have the ul menu in a separate file called layout.html
[20:03:15] <pavonia> When it links to another page, why does the handler still matter?
[20:04:47] <sydbarret> basically i have a list of customer_ids in page A so when I click one of them I need that my left menu items show 3 other options to click.
[20:05:10] <sydbarret> When clicking customer_id lands on Page B
[20:05:39] <sydbarret> Those other 3 options are just contextual or pertaining to the customer
[20:05:55] <sydbarret> They should dissapear when I click other menu options
[20:07:10] <pavonia> Have a reference to them and $menu.remove() them
[20:09:22] <sydbarret> yeah but you didnt tell me how to make them stay in the menu when landing on another page
[20:09:31] <sydbarret> so this works
[20:09:32] <sydbarret> $('ul').append($("<li>").text("Some Text."));
[20:09:43] <sydbarret> but it wont stay when going to page B
[20:13:24] <sydbarret> pavonia sorry i got disconnected
[21:57:49] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret when you say "page" do you mean actuall full page, or when you click on another "page" of results?
[21:59:23] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees I think i was overcomplicating it. Basically I need a way to have more option when loading customer detail page. I think that can be done directly in the layout.html where i have my nav menu. I need just an if statement to ask which
[21:59:25] <sydbarret> page im in
[21:59:29] <sydbarret> or wich url im in
[21:59:54] <sydbarret> i.e. when im on customer detail url then menu options should show 3 more li tags
[22:00:08] <sydbarret> if not they should be removed
[22:00:25] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[22:01:20] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees so now how can I get the url in jquery
[22:01:28] <sydbarret> locally looks like http://localhost:5000/dashboard
[22:01:54] <sydbarret> perhaps just grabing the dashboard word innit
[22:02:03] <sydbarret> Let me try it
[22:03:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're speaking in a lot of abstract concepts - what url?  when?  i know what urls look like so showing that doesn't really help clarify your question.
[22:03:35] <sydbarret> oh wait the actual link is http://localhost:5000/customer/2814
[22:03:37] <robertmaxrees> i would work on getting used to building jsfiddles.
[22:03:57] <sydbarret> url or landing page from the site that is
[22:04:14] <sydbarret> that for example is the customer_detail page i have
[22:04:21] <sydbarret> say customer_detail.html
[22:04:27] <sydbarret> so when I land on that page
[22:04:37] <sydbarret> menu options should have 3 more links
[22:04:39] <robertmaxrees> again.
[22:05:00] <robertmaxrees> "page" as in a separate full url or "page" as in a set of results in a datatable?
[22:06:27] <sydbarret> im not talking about datatables. For example if you go to this link http://sweetleafuniversity.com/
[22:06:37] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[22:06:39] <sydbarret> you can see it has 6 menu options right?
[22:06:50] <sydbarret> if you click the about button
[22:06:57] <sydbarret> then it should add 2 more and thats it
[22:07:10] <sydbarret> if you click Media button then those 2 should dissapear
[22:07:21] <robertmaxrees> "add 2 more" ??  you mean show the menu?
[22:07:35] <sydbarret> 2 more options like those 6 ones
[22:07:44] <robertmaxrees> wat
[22:07:47] <sydbarret> for example it should show option 1 and option 2 besides media
[22:07:49] <sydbarret> button
[22:08:27] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're trying to accomplish lol
[22:08:33] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[22:08:38] <sydbarret> just le me ask you this how can I get jquery to check that im in url like this http://localhost:5000/customer/2814
[22:08:50] <sydbarret> localhost of course wont be there
[22:08:53] <robertmaxrees> like on that page?
[22:08:53] <sydbarret> but the live domain one
[22:09:12] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the page url?
[22:09:48] <sydbarret> i need to grab it and then do like this   $('ul').append($("<li>").text("Some Text."));
[22:10:03] <robertmaxrees> why?
[22:10:04] <sydbarret> so if url=have_customer_word_between_slash then
[22:10:11] <sydbarret> $('ul').append($("<li>").text("Some Text."))
[22:10:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what the page's url has to do with appending an li somewhere.
[22:10:18] <sydbarret> its like a contextual menu
[22:10:31] <sydbarret> do you know what a contextual menu is?
[22:10:39] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[22:10:46] <robertmaxrees> your question, as phrased, doesn't make sense.
[22:10:49] <sydbarret> those are menuy options that appear based on page you are in
[22:10:50] <robertmaxrees> please make a fiddle :)
[22:11:55] <sydbarret> i cant do a fiddle
[22:12:00] <sydbarret> showing navigation
[22:12:17] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.  you can stub out the "url" portion of this using a variable.
[22:12:47] <robertmaxrees> long story short, if you're trying to, say, modify the menu on pagelaod based on the url, don't do that with jquery.  do that in your backend.
[22:13:12] <sydbarret> my backend is flask
[22:13:21] <sydbarret> what does have to do with menu options?
[22:13:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[22:13:40] <sydbarret> my layout.html contains nav.ul.li elements
[22:13:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to modify the menu on pageload based on the url?
[22:13:47] <sydbarret> and thats a template i load on every page
[22:14:04] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees yes
[22:14:09] <sydbarret> thats all it is
[22:14:17] <robertmaxrees> do that in your backend.  no using jquery.
[22:14:21] <robertmaxrees> *not
[22:14:56] <sydbarret> i dont know how
[22:15:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:15:12] <sydbarret> im using {% extends 'layout.html' %}  {% block content %}
[22:15:17] <sydbarret> on every page
[22:15:27] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: go to a channel about flast.
[22:15:30] <robertmaxrees> or read docs :)
[22:15:47] <sydbarret> the layout is static man
[22:15:53] <sydbarret> what does it have to do with rendering the page
[22:16:09] <robertmaxrees> everything.
[22:16:33] <robertmaxrees> it's what builds the html to send to the browser.
[22:17:20] <robertmaxrees> iirc flask uses Jinja2 for templates.
[22:18:14] <sydbarret> so what update need to do when calling render_template(customer.html) ?
[22:18:35] <robertmaxrees> been a long time.  go check the flask and jinja docs.
[22:18:49] <robertmaxrees> https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates
[22:18:55] <sydbarret> this is jinja2 {% extends 'layout.html' %}
[22:19:02] <sydbarret> it means to render the menu on everypage
[22:19:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:19:30] <sydbarret> probably what you are saying is to have another layout2.html
[22:19:34] <robertmaxrees> no.
[22:19:37] <sydbarret> with those 2 more options
[22:19:47] <sydbarret> and extends that in the customer.html
[22:19:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that within the template, you can conditionally change the contents.
[22:20:25] <sydbarret> yes
