[09:17:34] <grid-> hey
[09:17:44] <grid-> how can i set test just being a variable op the input? https://jsfiddle.net/jht8r09o/
[09:17:49] <grid-> op=of
[09:20:06] <grid-> i could just remove line 20 but that doesn't look fancy, right?
[09:26:19] <grid-> bootprompt.prompt("What is your name?",function(result){
[09:26:19] <grid-> 						return 0;
[09:26:19] <grid->             });
[09:26:23] <grid-> something like this?
[09:41:04] <Cork> grid-: what are you asking for?
[09:41:11] <Cork> i don't follow your question at all
[09:43:34] <Cork> are you asking how to control the content in the bootstrap popup=
[09:43:42] <Cork> *?
[09:46:59] <grid-> Cork: i'm having currently a situation where i use this in my project: bedrag = Number(prompt("Bedrag:"));
[09:47:16] <grid-> it will store the input of the prompt into the js variable bedrag
[09:47:41] <grid-> to have it more fancy i used bootprompt
[09:47:59] <grid-> if i do bootprompt.prompt("What is your name?", function(bedrag) {
[09:47:59] <grid-> 					alert(bedrag);
[09:47:59] <grid->         });
[09:48:01] <Cork> ok, for bootstrap you should ask in there channel, as it isn't really ontopic here
[09:48:18] <Cork> but you can't return values from a callback, you have to handle it inside the callback
[09:48:40] <grid-> bedrag is going to get the value but it will not go futher with the code below the function
[09:48:57] <grid-> so anything that comes after that
[09:49:01] <Cork> ya, cause the code after the function runs BEFORE
[09:49:22] <Cork> the callback is what is called async, it is called when the dialog action happens, not inline with the code
[09:49:42] <grid-> have you got a clue how i get it inline?
[09:49:49] <Cork> you can't
[09:49:58] <Cork> you have to rething your code flow
[09:50:07] <grid-> so bedrag = Number(prompt("Bedrag:")); is just inline
[09:50:10] <Cork> if it gets inlined, it would hang the page
[09:51:10] <Cork> unless your using es7 await that shouldn't be possible, as the button isn't clickable if you hang the page
[09:51:41] <Cork> (and webpages don't use es7 as it isn't compatible with enough browsers)
[09:52:52] <Cork> ah, wait you talk about window.prompt, and it is an old dom0 hack
[09:53:12] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/3qd5uhyn/
[09:53:18] <grid-> that's the code in jquery
[09:53:20] <Cork> yes, old propmpt is implemented by the browser and they for legacy demands has a lot of hacks to make that actually work
[09:53:34] <Cork> but with custom dialogs (aka in page dialogs) you can't do that
[09:54:02] <grid-> line 9 has to do the same that will do line 8
[09:54:06] <Cork> ya, cause line 12 runs before line 10
[09:54:18] <grid-> yeah
[09:54:40] <Cork> execution order is line 9 (bootpropmpt.prompt), 12+, later 9 (function)
[09:54:52] <Cork> so you can't access the result inside it outside the function
[09:55:13] <Cork> don't see window.prompt as a reference, cause it isn't how library functions can function
[09:57:57] <grid-> i need an alternative for window.prompt because it will not work ok with this selectbox on tablets, if i click on a value of the selectbox in this script, the selectbox will stay in the screen, if i click somewhere else in the screen the window.prompt will popup and the selectbox will get it's normal state back
[09:58:25] <Cork> ok, then you have to rewrite it so it doesn't expect return values
[09:58:34] <Cork> cause you can't get that with alternatives
[09:58:35] <grid-> that is only happening on the ipad (chrome and safari), but it works ok on this macbook (chrome and safari) also windows (chrome safari)
[10:04:16] <grid-> ok i try to investigate it
[10:04:22] <grid-> maybe to build a new code
[20:45:27] <Ansh> hey guys
[22:43:39] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/j0er9o83/3/
[22:44:05] <grid-> anyone got a clue why the handler for change doesn't work?
[22:44:16] <grid-> line 103
[22:44:58] <grid-> it's bound to the select with the class form-control of the dialog when you press edit
