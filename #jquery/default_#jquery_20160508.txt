[02:21:06] <mrtAkdeniz> Hello there
[02:21:14] <mrtAkdeniz> https://jsfiddle.net/gq6qzm3p/ i can't figure out what is wrong
[02:21:56] <mrtAkdeniz> when I off mouse to go into dropdown menu, it goes invisible
[13:45:43] <Jagst3r15> does anyone have a chance to help with HTML5 video/jQuery issues that has been killing me for days?
[17:34:14] <jquery667> Hi all, I'm doing an intro course to jquery and I feel that some of the material is outdated.  Is .delegate() still used and if not, what is the recommended way of handling dynamic elements?  Thanks
[17:34:48] <systemfault> jquery667: .delegate is not used anymore... since 1.7, they decided they wanted a single function to do it all.
[17:34:51] <systemfault> It's .on
[17:35:09] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:35:36] <jquery667> That's great, thanks.
[17:35:36] <systemfault> element.on(eventName, handler) is like .bind,  rootElement.on(eventName, selector, handler) works like .delegate
[17:40:59] <jquery667> Ok, it works.  Thanks again.  One more thing - if I want to use .hover() with .on(), do I need to check event.type or can I pass two functions?
[17:45:33] <jquery667> i guess just use separate functions for mouseenter and mouseleave?  what is good practice?

[18:47:39] <printForever> Google API (inside Google Developer Console) is throwing JS error when trying to use their API via HTTP referrer.
[18:47:57] <printForever> Even though, they do accept request from HTTP referrers.

[19:28:30] <hobo> i have a table where i want to use jquery to click on a row, and then grab a hidden column value
[21:42:30] <phelix> so I am using an ajax request.. inside this ajax request in the success function I have an array of item names. I am then doing a foreach $('.element').find('a').each(function() { and trying to match an item from the a attribute to an item in the success data return.. what is best way to accomplish this?
[21:43:38] <phelix> should i loop through the data instead?
[21:54:14] <jak2000> hi all
[21:54:33] <jak2000> PahitLidah?
[22:10:53] <phelix> why would if($('#block-superfish-1').length) work just fine until I add $.each(data.data, function(k, b) { inside of it? Then I get cannon read property 'length' of undefined ?
[22:14:09] <phelix> I don't understand how #block-superfish-1 exists. But adding a $.each loop inside that if statement makes it undefined.
[23:38:58] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/sasapp/171zr14a/1/ how to do this ?
