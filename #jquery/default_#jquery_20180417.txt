[02:57:53] <nate073> Hi, im a complete programming newb just trying to figure out how to implement the "Cupertino" style for my datepicker in my Wordpress Woocommerce checkout page.  I installed a plugin called WP DatePicker 1.4.3 but have no clue what to do.  I just now downloaded ZIP file of what looks like it contains the "Cupertino" theme style for the datepicker (file name "jquery-ui-1.12.1.custom.zip").  Can someone tell me where to put this or wha
[02:59:15] <nate073> The current DatePicker works, by the way, but the color scheme SUCKS!   :)
[03:02:36] <nate073> WP Datepicker says I can "Enter id, class, name-based and/or type-based CSS selector" and "You can enter multiple selectors as CSV (Comma Separated Values)."  So, maybe I can use this plugin to CALL UP the "Cupertino" theme???

[03:04:00] <nate073> Thanks for anyone's help.
[03:05:18] <nate073> If you need my website name, I can give that, too.  THANKS!
[03:07:04] <nate073> You can go through the quick order process, as a test, to arrive at the checkout page, where the ugly datepicker is now.
[03:07:34] <nate073> Anyone out there?
[03:11:55] <nate073> I think I see where my current jQuery thingy is at:   jQuery UI - v1.9.0 - 2012-10-05
[03:12:21] <nate073> I just downloaded 1.12.1.  Where and how do I implement this???

[06:59:51] <anli> Where is $find defined?
[07:00:28] <anli> Its hard to google
[07:07:07] <AdamPDotty1> .find() ?
[07:07:30] <AdamPDotty1> Cant find find?
[07:08:34] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ I want to target the input box(price) exactly after the service input...WHENEVER THE SERVICE INPUT IS EDITED
[07:10:01] <dimi1947> for example:imagine that I edit the service input which has as value hair...I want to target the price input in the right of it
[07:10:52] <dimi1947> I have set up a handler at line 163
[07:13:10] <AdamPDotty1> indentation seems messy
[07:15:23] <AdamPDotty1> you want something like nextSibling() ?
[07:16:18] <AdamPDotty1> or rather just next()
[07:16:37] <AdamPDotty1> $(this).next()
[07:17:20] <AdamPDotty1> to add performance: var that = $(this);
[09:05:06] <vish93> Hi guys if anyone has used https://simonbengtsson.github.io/jsPDF-AutoTable/#html to create pdf from tables, is it posisble to check classes applied on td?
[09:09:26] <Cork> vish93: have you checked https://github.com/simonbengtsson/jsPDF-AutoTable it is quite well documented
[09:11:09] <vish93> Cork: Yepp I have read the docs, but cannot find what I need
[09:15:57] <Cork> vish93: it has a createdCell hook you prob want to look into that
[09:16:13] <Cork> (never used the lib so not fully sure how though)
[09:16:36] <Cork> vish93: but this sounds like it is what you want to look into https://github.com/simonbengtsson/jsPDF-AutoTable/blob/master/src/creator.ts#L137
[09:16:37] <vish93> Cork, I have the following thus far https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/full/zjOEwj/
[09:43:20] <tsukasadt> Please bear with me, I'm just trying to make certain that the issue is beyond my ability to fix. We use a CMS managed by a third-party. We are able to load one custom JavaScript and CSS file, but we can't do anything to the files of the actual CMS. I have a jQuery script that executes with $(document).ready(function() {}); without issue on every page except one. Adding a breakpoint to the ready call, I can see that the .ready() is
[09:43:20] <tsukasadt> executed, but the function provided is not. There is no error. If I switch to a (function($) {})(jQuery); call, it executes, but that results in the first few lines of code executing before the page finishes its load. Since it works fine everyone except this one page and I can't do anything with the CMS files, would this not be an issue for the third-party to resolve?
[09:59:02] <AdamPDotty1> tsukasadt: Did you try and rename the function?
[10:02:26] <tsukasadt> I tried it as an anonymous function placed directly in .ready() and as a named function loaded before the .ready(), but neither worked, and I'm pretty sure "runMeOnReadyOrElse" was not already taken. ^^'
[10:05:44] <Woet> tsukasadt: show your test case
[10:09:57] <tsukasadt> Can't give you access to the actual site, but here's the code snippets I've used just to test the issue: https://thepasteb.in/p/2RhJc2Y47q8ymiz
[10:10:25] <tsukasadt> They all work on every page except the one. The comments denote the results on that one page.
[10:11:40] <tsukasadt> I'm pretty sure the issue is with code from the third-party, but I'm not 100% certain. It just doesn't make sense to me that the .ready() executes (I've followed it via developer tools) but the function does not.
[11:28:43] <fadavi> hello there. anyone here can help me to implement a circular html list like this? https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/5e20cf46007757.Y3JvcCwxNTAzLDExNzYsMCww.jpg
[11:47:24] <JuJUBee> Im using datepicker and trying to display 10 months always starting with Sept.  Any suggestions?
[11:47:59] <JuJUBee> Im guessing I have to mess with the monthsOffset to use calculation?  or is there an easier way?
[12:25:42] <RyansWorld> Have you ever used Moment.js
[12:48:04] <Andr3as> hello everyone.. i have 3 inputs, all with the class rrcalc... i also have a span with some content and i want to delete that content if less than 2 of those 3 input fields have values... you guys have any hint where i could look at? fwiw here's a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/sr3gdrmk/3/
[12:49:04] <robertmaxrees> Andr3as what have you tried so far?
[12:50:10] <Andr3as> robertmaxrees: am stuck.. probably due to the fact that i totally suck at coding.. i thought i select all of the inputs and loop through, checking for a value != ' '
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> show me that much at least :)
[12:50:28] <Andr3as> but then i though, maybe there's a cleaner way?
[12:50:33] <robertmaxrees> just to see where your head's at.
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> then I can point you in the right direction.
[12:50:59] <Andr3as> i will give it a try.. will take some time
[12:51:12] <robertmaxrees> well.
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> so break the problem down - you want to know if "less than 2" inputs have a value, right?
[12:51:56] <Andr3as> yes
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> you can use .filter() to do that very easily :)
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:53:36] <Andr3as> that sounds quite promising, thank you robert!
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you going to put into that span btw?
[12:56:59] <Andr3as> its going to be a calculator kind of thing and should less than two of the inputs (entry, stop loss, target) be filled out, it wouldnt calculate a thing and should get rid of the highlighted text
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> so why not invert that logic a little?
[12:57:26] <robertmaxrees> and say "if at least 2 things are filled in"?
[12:58:21] <Andr3as> i kinda have that already.. i show it if at least are two filled in (its a different formula in each case) - but if i empty a filled in input i want to get rid of the "result text"
[12:58:56] <Andr3as> the check isnt "at least 2 are filled" though
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:59:24] <Andr3as> i do it explicitely.. so if target and stop are filled i calculate the entry, if entry and target are filled, i claculate the stop
[12:59:42] <Andr3as> due to the different formula
[12:59:52] <JuJUBee> RyansWorld, I have not, but as I look at it I am not sure it will help.
[13:03:21] <JuJUBee> RyansWorld, with multiple months enabled, it seems to center the calendar based on the date in the input (or the current month if empty)
[13:09:58] <dimi1947> go in this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ and click the edit button...I know I can access the price input(left of the radio buttons) with prev()...I want to access also the service input...left of the price input...how to do it?)
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> "service input"?
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> oh, i see what you mean.
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> within what event handler?
[13:11:38] <dimi1947> very good to ask...
[13:12:07] <dimi1947> I am afraid I have it only locally....give me a min to put it the fiddle
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> huge fiddle for such a small question lol
[13:12:18] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:12:33] <robertmaxrees> is the event handler on a particular element?
[13:14:46] <Andr3as> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot - i got it working.. not the fiddle though.. the code which works locally aint gonna work with the fiddle, even though i loaded the jquery libs.. anyway, you saved my day, thank you
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> Andr3as erm, what?
[13:15:36] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it work?
[13:15:59] <dimi1947> line 5...it does not work in the fiddle,I do not know why...by looking it though you will understand that the handler is triggered when clicking tha radio button
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> erm...
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/iZOKJQy.png wut
[13:16:35] <Andr3as> no idea, actually.. looks like it wont load jquery..(?)
[13:16:48] <robertmaxrees> could you update the fiddle and link it out?
[13:17:06] <Andr3as> https://jsfiddle.net/sr3gdrmk/10/
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that works fine here.
[13:18:04] <robertmaxrees> but also: https://i.imgur.com/l6GXQPC.png
[13:18:09] <Andr3as> funny.. not working here
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> include jquery using this dropdown instead.
[13:18:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sr3gdrmk/12/
[13:18:27] <Andr3as> yeah, i tried that at first.. didnt work, so i loaded via cdn
[13:18:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:18:43] <Andr3as> anyway, important part is, it works in my app ;)
[13:18:43] <dimi1947> now it is working...when you are ready take a look at it
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 just link it out.  if I can help, i will.
[13:19:44] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/159/
[13:20:08] <dimi1947> the hnadler starts at line 5
[13:20:47] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[13:20:57] <dimi1947> and as I said...need to access service input...
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> so when you change the radio, you need to access the two inputs to its left?
[13:21:17] <dimi1947> exactly
[13:21:43] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() to go up to the nearest shared parent (looks like .wrapper_servp maybe?) and then .find() off of that result to get the inputs you want.
[13:21:54] <dimi1947> hmmmm
[13:22:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:22:22] <dimi1947> it never occured me...
[13:23:16] <dimi1947> occured to me
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:54:03] <ryan_for1> I'm trying to set a css custom property. what selector should I use?
[13:54:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the property?
[13:54:21] <ryan_for1> I found a SO suggesting $(document.documentElement)
[13:55:26] <ryan_for1> one is a string like '50px' and the other is a number value
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> and on what element?
[13:56:03] <ryan_for1> I'll be using them to set grid properties on a div
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> then you just select the elements and set the propery.  though i'd wonder why you'd do that via jquery.
[13:57:03] <ryan_for1> are you familiar with css custom properties?
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> talking about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--* ?
[13:57:34] <ryan_for1> yes variables
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd follow something like https://stackoverflow.com/a/36088890/923919 or https://stackoverflow.com/a/49419028/923919
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> but i'd still wonder why you'd set those using js in the first place.
[13:58:44] <dimi1947> closest() gives price input...which is exactly left of the radio buttons...as such I tried closest().prev() to get the service input but for reasons I cannot explain I get price input again
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 nonono.
[13:59:07] <dimi1947> enlighten me
[13:59:15] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 .closest('sharedparenthere'), then do .find('theinputyouwant') for each of the inputs.
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 the idea is that you don't need .prev() or anything.
[13:59:49] <dimi1947> can you give an example...by editing the fiddle?
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:57] <robertmaxrees> link?
[13:59:57] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/169/
[14:00:08] <ryan_for1> I'm doing a little etch-a-sketch thing, and the grid is dynamic, so I just want to change the css variable wih js/jQ
[14:00:16] <ryan_for1> for the cell sizes
[14:00:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you need to pass a selector to .closest()
[14:00:34] <robertmaxrees> ryan_for1 instead of using responsive CSS?
[14:00:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:00:50] <ryan_for1> dynamic like based on user input
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:01:03] <dimi1947> I understand....
[14:01:15] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 so when there's the block? :)
[14:01:33] <dimi1947> there is no block NOW
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> oh, rad.
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> :D
[14:02:26] <dimi1947> after you explained to me the correct usage of closest...
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> sorry, though that was clear originally :)
[14:03:53] <dimi1947> maybe I misuderstood...it is not that important
[14:07:00] <dimi1947> ...and you said to use find() then?
[14:07:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.  same thing with that - gotta give it a selector to tell it what you want.
[14:09:18] <dimi1947> i do not get it
[14:09:41] <dimi1947> oh...I could search for input
[14:12:14] <robertmaxrees> right
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> so the .closest() gets you to that parent element.
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> then you .find() the specific input you want.
[14:21:19] <dimi1947> the problem again is how to choose the specific input that is left of the radio button group being edited...the DOM has many inputs noneheless
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> you select the specific class you want.
[14:23:48] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.wrapper_servp').find('.services'
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> * .closest('.wrapper_servp').find('.services') for instance
[14:24:03] <dimi1947> all the service inputs have the same class
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:24:35] <robertmaxrees> right, but because you're doing .closest() to that .wrapper_servp and then using .find() off of that, you'll only get the one you want.
[14:26:07] <dimi1947> yes but that will work only for the topmost service input....which is closest wrapper_servp...
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:26:26] <dimi1947> can you edit the fiddle?
[14:26:29] <dimi1947> please?
[14:26:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why i need to edit it.

[14:27:45] <robertmaxrees> where'd your code for that event handler go?

[14:29:06] <dimi1947> just a minute...to copy it from locally

[14:41:01] <jak2000> wich part of code?
[14:41:34] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to make an event handler for that.

[14:47:01] <jak2000> i am happy because have a friend named robertmaxrees (i visit him at August 2018)
[14:47:41] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I'm using fullCalendar, and I wanted to know if its possible to attach a function at the execution end of the default click event on the grid's buttons
[14:47:44] <lte-13[m]> robermaxrees: "Getdata2 is undefined
[14:47:53] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 i'd bind as low as possible, but that's the basic gist
[14:48:43] <dimi1947> what do you mean by saying "i 'd bind as low as possible"
[14:48:58] <lte-13[m]> Also this:
[14:49:01] <ZeuZ> that being, without modifying fullCalendar.. I've checked up queues but not enough it seems since I can't really understand how to do it
[14:49:24] <lte-13[m]> Or no.. Hmm
[14:49:53] <robertmaxrees> lte-13[m] you sure you have the same casing there? :)
[14:51:44] <lte-13[m]> https://i.imgur.com/nPNY1hp.png
[14:52:31] <robertmaxrees> lte-13[m] not sure what that's supposed to show me heh.
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> but i would fix those errors.
[14:56:06] <ZeuZ> Or is there any way to search what queue is it in, and change its order?
[14:57:40] <lte-13[m]> Or hmm
[14:57:41] <lte-13[m]> It gives me two of those
[14:57:42] <lte-13[m]> If i put console log in the function

[14:59:06] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ so what are you trying to do again?
[15:00:31] <ZeuZ> robertmaxrees, trying to attach a new function to the click event, but after the currently attached one
[15:00:46] <ZeuZ> since .on() is triggering it BEFORE the already attached one
[15:01:09] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:01:11] <ZeuZ> To be more specific, I need fullCalendar to execute its code to move the grid to the new month, and then my function to parse some data
[15:02:06] <robertmaxrees> ok back
[15:02:22] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ gotta link to the docs for fullCalendar handy?
[15:02:25] <lte-13[m]> Hmm

[15:03:46] <jak2000> http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples    in sample6 see Jquery code, when exist onajax event ignore the alert..
[15:03:51] <ZeuZ> robertmaxrees, the idea is not modifying fullCalendar, but using jQuery to attach the new function at the end of the queue, not at the top
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ right, which isn't really A Thing You Can Easily Do™, so I'm wondering if fullcalendar has anything that might help here :)
[15:04:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so what's the question?
[15:05:03] <ZeuZ> robertmaxrees, figured that out yeah :) I've seen people using the internals of jQuery to insert in first (top) of the queue
[15:05:11] <ZeuZ> but I'm afraid of breakage upon update
[15:05:16] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ so do you have a link to their docs handy?
[15:05:17] <ZeuZ> let me check if fullcalendar has something
[15:05:17] <robertmaxrees> ??
[15:05:31] <ZeuZ> robertmaxrees, https://fullcalendar.io/docs
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ https://fullcalendar.io/docs/changeView does this apply?
[15:07:39] <ZeuZ> not really
[15:07:56] <ZeuZ> thats what it will do when clicked in the next month button already
[15:08:09] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or anything you can share out?
[15:08:20] <robertmaxrees> super hard to help when we don't have an exaple in front of us :)
[15:08:24] <ZeuZ> yeah I can forward my 80 port for a while, gimme a sec
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> don't waste your time then.
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:08:46] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are always much preferred.
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so what's your question??
[15:09:12] <ZeuZ> problem being the data fetched from the MariaDB database
[15:09:23] <robertmaxrees> ZeuZ i don't want/need the backend tho.
[15:09:30] <robertmaxrees> just an isolated test case.
[15:09:33] <robertmaxrees> nbd if it's a pain.
[15:09:46] <robertmaxrees> just thought i missed your test case :)
[15:11:19] <jak2000> robertmaxrees i need execute Onajax and execute other personal code..... how to do?
[15:11:52] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you add those callbacks to the init object you're passing tabledit
[15:14:24] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 does that make sense?
[15:15:01] <jak2000> mmm yes, sorry not know
[15:15:12] <jak2000> can you recommend me read any url/link ?
[15:15:29] <robertmaxrees> notice how you're doing url: 'example.php',
[15:15:48] <robertmaxrees> in your code
[15:16:48] <jak2000> url: "servletLomita",    is a Java servlet
[15:16:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:17:00] <jak2000> here i get the changes, parameters...
[15:17:15] <robertmaxrees> that's an option you're setting on that object.
[15:17:17] <jak2000> specified here: identifier: [0, 'Id'],editable: [[3, 'Lote'], [4, 'Cantidad'], [5, 'TipoEmpaque', myATipoEmpaque]]
[15:17:31] <robertmaxrees> you're missing my point.
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> so if that's how you set the url, how would you set, say, onAjax?
[15:18:32] <jak2000> with a function?
[15:18:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:18:48] <robertmaxrees> so what would that look like?
[15:18:53] <jak2000> onAjax: function (action, serialize) {
[15:18:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:18:59] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:19:24] <jak2000> ok
[15:19:32] <jak2000> where put the click buton?
[15:19:47] <jak2000> save: { class: 'btn btn-sm btn-success mySaveButton',   <--- ?
[15:19:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean for the saveButton?
[15:20:11] <jak2000> $(document).on("click", ".mySaveButton", function () {    <----for
[15:20:14] <jak2000> yes
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with the save buttonm?
[15:20:35] <jak2000> i capture quantyty i want show the multiplication quantity by price
[15:20:49] <jak2000> modifying the fiddle
[15:21:32] <robertmaxrees> any reason that can't be part of the ajax callbacks instead?
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> i gotta grab lunch bbiab
[15:25:02] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wait amoment
[15:25:03] <jak2000> :)
[15:25:03] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/12/
[15:25:40] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/13/
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> and back.
[16:05:16] <jak2000> :)
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> you figure it out?
[16:05:49] <jak2000> no :(
[16:06:00] <jak2000> giv me ... a hand little hand
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> so where are you stuck?
[16:06:05] <jak2000> not all work but a little
[16:06:25] <jak2000> i am here: https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/14/
[16:06:39] <robertmaxrees> ... so where are you stuck?
[16:06:51] <jak2000> not catch the
[16:07:00] <jak2000> change on saVVe button
[16:07:08] <jak2000> and modify the total
[16:07:23] <robertmaxrees> well wait.
[16:07:23] <jak2000> " part of the ajax callbacks instead?"
[16:07:29] <robertmaxrees> does the save fire the ajax?
[16:07:56] <jak2000> yes
[16:08:00] <jak2000> fire my ajax...
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> okay, so then why not return the total from your server and update using that instead?
[16:09:01] <jak2000> i have 3 ways: 1) with Jquery change the total, 2) server return total, 3) reload the entire table with an ajax....
[16:09:10] <jak2000> like me last ...
[16:09:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> you want to do the last?
[16:09:31] <jak2000> yes
[16:09:34] <robertmaxrees> then do that?
[16:09:39] <robertmaxrees> not sure where the confusion.
[16:09:41] <robertmaxrees> *is
[16:10:20] <jak2000> i have in my servlet with json, the htmltable
[16:10:31] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:10:40] <jak2000> in wich part of the code:
[16:10:46] <jak2000> assign ?
[16:10:46] <jak2000> http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[16:10:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue??
[16:10:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:11:08] <jak2000> onajax execute the POST right?
[16:11:22] <jak2000> where put this line:
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd do that in onSuccess
[16:11:42] <robertmaxrees> not onAjax.
[16:11:44] <jak2000>  $('.myTable').html(json.HtmTable);
[16:12:01] <jak2000> okay
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> onAjax fires before the ajax call is actually done.
[16:12:07] <jak2000> yes
[16:12:09] <robertmaxrees> as the docs explain.
[16:12:24] <robertmaxrees> http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#documentation bottom of the page.
[16:12:53] <jak2000> ok
[16:13:02] <jak2000> onSuccess(data, textStatus, jqXHR)   <--- this receive a json?
[16:13:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you think? :)
[16:13:52] <jak2000> data  is my json?
[16:13:53] <jak2000> testing
[16:13:56] <jak2000> :)
[16:14:02] <jak2000> ooo so so i understand
[16:15:11] <jak2000> also
[16:15:35] <jak2000> in onSucesss can i write jQuery code (callying an ajax...
[16:15:36] <jak2000> testing
[16:15:52] <robertmaxrees> why would you do another ajax call?
[16:17:02] <jak2000> 1) i have a function that execute an ajax request..... this ajax, create an html table......
[16:17:33] <jak2000> i thinkk when the user save changes call again the function that create html table....
[16:17:44] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you returning that data with the response to the original ajax request?
[16:17:56] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing 2 different calls.
[16:20:28] <jak2000> 1 for create html table and 2 for row change?
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> again - why not make that 1 trip?
[16:21:05] <jak2000> yes understand
[16:21:18] <jak2000> done 1 trip
[16:21:31] <jak2000> now change onSucess only with jQuery code
[16:23:16] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/16/   <-- interesting onSucess event
[16:24:00] <robertmaxrees> why is that so interesting?
[16:25:00] <jak2000> not know :)
[16:27:14] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/22/   i want display the row modified
[16:27:21] <jak2000> not display it,
[16:30:28] <jak2000> oo: responded with a status of 404 ()
[16:30:36] <jak2000> example.ph not exist of course
[16:30:44] <jak2000> how to modify for can play?
[16:39:57] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you mean modify so it'll work in the fiddle?
[16:41:48] <jak2000> yes
[16:42:10] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to modify it to use some JSON i'd assume.
[16:42:19] <robertmaxrees> or fake the ajax call.
[16:52:06] <jak2000> i am test onError :)
[16:52:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:52:53] <jak2000> removed url
[16:52:54] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/32/
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> that's probably not going to work tbh.
[16:53:50] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/34/ <--- yes work
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything happen w/r/t the ajax stuff
[16:54:23] <robertmaxrees> but alright
[16:54:24] <jak2000> 2 things 1 of course this:  $('.myTotal').html('12111'); change all 3 rows... and 2) why the alert is empty?
[16:54:44] <jak2000> i want change mytotal column/class
[16:55:09] <robertmaxrees> $('.myTotal').html('12111'); is finding every .myTotal and replacing the html of each.
[16:55:38] <robertmaxrees> and idRow doesn't match anything probably becuase $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to update one row on save?
[16:56:09] <jak2000> yes
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> not really gonna work afaik
[16:56:33] <jak2000> get the id of the row 1 or 2 or 3 and change the total = qty * price
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to return that id as part of the response and go from ther.
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> *there
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> and don't do that match in your client-side.
[16:57:03] <robertmaxrees> send back the total precalculated.
[16:59:47] <jak2000> ok.
[16:59:49] <jak2000> understand
[16:59:59] <jak2000> and how to modify the actual row? the toal?
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to select based on the id you return from your server.
[17:00:18] <jak2000> suppose the result is: 12111   ?
[17:00:31] <robertmaxrees> and then find the total based on whatever row has that id.
[17:00:43] <jak2000> then need create a class: myTotal_1
[17:00:48] <robertmaxrees> or an ID, yes.
[17:00:48] <jak2000> myTotal_@  and so on?
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't put that on the total though.
[17:01:02] <jak2000> error myTotal_2
[17:01:03] <robertmaxrees> put it on the tr.
[17:01:09] <jak2000> wait
[17:01:33] <jak2000> <tr id='myRow_1'>   ?
[17:02:30] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/38/
[17:02:31] <jak2000> :(
[17:03:14] <jak2000> error
[17:03:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[17:03:24] <jak2000> i get the rownumber modified and?
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> be clearer my dude.
[17:03:50] <jak2000> no rror
[17:03:53] <jak2000> no error
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> so how are you confused?
[17:04:23] <jak2000> imodifi the total column
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:04:37] <jak2000> i am positioned on the id2 in this case myRow_2
[17:04:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:05:09] <robertmaxrees> you realize that the save event doesn't have any concept of which button you pushed, right?
[17:05:11] <jak2000> how toreffer
[17:05:54] <jak2000> how to refer total of the second row?
[17:06:00] <robertmaxrees> your server will give you back the ID, right?
[17:06:13] <jak2000>   var myrow= $('#myRow_2');
[17:06:16] <jak2000> yes in this case 2
[17:06:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> then .find('whateverthetotalinputis')
[17:06:30] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you what you need.
[17:07:30] <jak2000> mmm not work: https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/41/
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:07:58] <robertmaxrees> because myRowId isn't the total.
[17:08:28] <jak2000> no
[17:08:37] <jak2000> but display the 2?
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#myRow_2').length);
[17:08:59] <robertmaxrees> what do you get back?
[17:09:34] <jak2000> undefined
[17:09:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:09:56] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/47/
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[17:10:15] <jak2000> checking again
[17:10:18] <jak2000> wait
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work in jsfiddle.
[17:10:39] <jak2000> is 0
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> then that's not the right selector.
[17:11:00] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/babco7xk/49/
[17:11:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to show the error in jsfiddle.
[17:11:29] <jak2000> see the line: 19 and 20 ?
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> you have an element with that ID.
[17:11:37] <jak2000> ok html section?
[17:11:48] <robertmaxrees> yes, you have the IDs there.
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> so the fiddle does not reflect your actual site.
[17:12:07] <jak2000> nook, but this is the idea?
[17:12:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:12:21] <jak2000> ok working..
[17:12:26] <jak2000> what about:
[17:12:47] <jak2000> var wRow = $('#myRow_2');    wRow.find('.myTotal').text('33121');   change the value of the Total?
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:13:04] <robertmaxrees> you want .val() to change the value.
[17:13:17] <jak2000> ok.

[17:20:50] <robertmaxrees> nate looks like there's a jquery ui updater plugin.

[17:51:04] <pdub> Hi folks, I have a jQuery question.  Pretty simple stuff-- it's a .mousedown issue.  I am trying to select multiple boxes via Click&Drag -- Here is my code.  http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1398/   I am trying to get it to work like this -- http://jsfiddle.net/Brv6J/
[17:51:14] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure you're actually getting the element you think you're getting.
[17:51:18] <pdub> Any idea why it is hightlighting things strangely?
[17:51:37] <jak2000> robertmaxrees if the class exist the length is 1 right?
[17:51:55] <robertmaxrees> 1 or more, yeah.
[17:52:54] <robertmaxrees> pdub you don't have the logic for mouseover or w/e it is.
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> pdub you're only handling clicks, mousedown, and mouseup.
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> but http://jsfiddle.net/Brv6J/ contains logic for mouseover.
[17:53:53] <pdub> robertmaxrees: ohhh so I do need the mouseover you think?  What is happening basically, is its allowing me to highlight only odd-numbered boxes onclick, which is weird
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> so then you have two issues?
[17:54:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:54:28] <pdub> any idea why the heck it would only highlight odd numbered ones?
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeign that at all.
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> *seeing
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[17:54:51] <robertmaxrees> i see it now.
[17:54:52] <pdub> ohhhhh
[17:54:57] <pdub> i see how the mouseover thing works now
[17:55:11] <pdub> mouseover is like the holdclick-drag aspect
[17:55:24] <jak2000> i get an 1....
[17:55:30] <jak2000> okay continue codig
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> also: binding evbent listeners within other listeners is a bad idea.
[17:56:35] <pdub> robertmaxrees: ahh i see
[17:56:37] <robertmaxrees> that's probably what's causing your current issue.
[17:56:46] <pdub> cool.
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> you should use delegated handlers for those instead.
[17:56:55] <pdub> hmm
[17:57:14] <pdub> the problem I was trying to figure out is... those boxes only exist when you click the category...
[17:57:27] <robertmaxrees> right, so delegated handlers will solve that for you.
[17:57:29] <pdub> so, my code wont have anything to work on, until the boxes exist (which is on the click of category)
[17:57:34] <pdub> ok, ill look those up
[17:57:36] <pdub> thanks man!
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:57:58] <pdub> many thanks for your help & advice!
[17:58:06] <pdub> im gonna read this link you sent

[17:58:39] <robertmaxrees> both of these will explain the concept pretty clearly.
[18:05:24] <pdub> nice, that's the one I was starting with
[18:05:55] <pdub> i understand event emitters from node, so this is pretty similar stuff
[18:06:00] <pdub> thanks man
[18:06:05] <pdub> looks like just what I need to read
[18:07:04] <pdub> whoa dude this is some crazy stuff
[18:07:07] <pdub> interesting though
[18:08:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:08:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic once you get your head around it.
[18:09:53] <robertmaxrees> similar-ish to events in node, yes.  DOM events have some distinct differences (like bubbling), but the mental modal should help otherwise.
[18:10:14] <taplar> model?
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah.
[18:15:06] <pdub> oh yeah, i remember reading about bubbling a while back.  havent worked with dom/UI stuff for a while
[18:30:36] <pdub> robertmaxrees: Dude.  Thanks to the resources you sent, I am a step closer.  Check it out :D
[18:30:40] <pdub> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1404/
[18:32:17] <pdub> robertmaxrees: it's no longer only allowing odd/even selections.  now all can be click-selected
[18:32:27] <pdub> robertmaxrees: still need to figure out the click-drag functionality though
[18:39:15] <pdub> robertmaxrees: dang.  preventDefault() is letting it work in the UI, but in the console it says Cannot read property 'preventDefault' of undefined , based on this: $box.event.preventDefault();
[18:53:37] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a second.
[18:54:22] <pdub> robertmaxrees: no prob
[18:55:33] <pdub> robertmaxrees: this is pretty weird now... If you open the console here in jsfiddle you'll see every time you click a box, it highlights, but there's an error http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1406/
[18:55:41] <pdub> Error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'preventDefault' of undefined
[18:56:14] <pdub> but if you fix line 49-- and add in 'event' to the mousedown function
[18:56:24] <pdub> and then remove $box in front of $box.event
[18:56:33] <pdub> the error goes away from the console, but now the UI doesn't work :P
[18:56:49] <pdub> robertmaxrees: its in a state of working brokenness
[19:01:32] <robertmaxrees> lemme take a look.
[19:02:13] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things.
[19:02:19] <robertmaxrees> 1: are you really using jquery 1.3?
[19:02:26] <robertmaxrees> 2: $box.event isn't a think.
[19:02:39] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[19:02:51] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to prevent the mousedown event?
[19:04:04] <taplar> "working brokeness" = functional dysfunction, :D
[19:04:11] <taplar> later
[19:04:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:04:14] <robertmaxrees> byeee
[19:04:42] <robertmaxrees> pdub also: you're still binding listeners within other listeners.
[19:04:54] <pdub> robertmaxrees: oh i thought i might need to
[19:04:57] <pdub> robertmaxrees: nevermind haha
[19:05:06] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[19:05:17] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason for the event delegation stuff was to not do that any more :)
[19:05:34] <pdub> hahaha
[19:06:44] <pdub> i dont understand how to create it outside the thing which it refers to :(
[19:07:01] <robertmaxrees> so let's solve that problem :)
[19:07:42] <robertmaxrees> so what did you learn about event delegation?
[19:08:15] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1409/
[19:08:22] <robertmaxrees> removed the unneeded html bits.
[19:08:39] <pdub> ughhhh
[19:08:44] <pdub> hahaha
[19:08:44] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[19:08:45] <pdub> well,
[19:08:53] <robertmaxrees> you have this static parent, right?
[19:08:55] <robertmaxrees> .boxContainer
[19:09:03] <pdub> Yes
[19:09:04] <robertmaxrees> and that's the element whose contents you change, right?
[19:09:08] <pdub> yes sir
[19:09:35] <robertmaxrees> so the idea with delegated listeners is you bind to a static parent that doesn't change.
[19:10:11] <robertmaxrees> think of it like this - $('parent-that-doesn't-change').on('event', 'dynamic-children', function() {});
[19:10:17] <pdub> I was experimenting a few mins ago (http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1410/) but didnt know what I was doing
[19:10:26] <pdub> ohhh
[19:10:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:10:37] <pdub> so I bind to the static thing! makes more sense than binding to sth that doesnt exist
[19:10:46] <robertmaxrees> that's what those docs explained :)
[19:10:50] <robertmaxrees> did you skip to the examples?
[19:11:05] <pdub> I read them...
[19:11:09] <robertmaxrees> heh alright.
[19:11:09] <pdub> i read pretty much everything
[19:11:17] <pdub> but was beguiled
[19:11:57] <pdub> "Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future."
[19:12:15] <pdub> "to a parent element" that will fire "for all descendants matching a selector"
[19:12:19] <pdub> niiiice thanks man, there it is right there
[19:12:26] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/b0UPCm5.png
[19:12:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:12:44] <robertmaxrees> that's what that's talking about.
[19:13:01] <pdub> robertmaxrees: dang thanks man!
[19:13:09] <pdub> robertmaxrees: it didnt sink in very well apparently
[19:13:11] <pdub> robertmaxrees: haha
[19:14:27] <pdub> Ok, im gonna start from a fresh place
[19:14:35] <robertmaxrees> :) awesome!
[19:14:37] <pdub> http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1412/ -- removed the click/drag attempts
[19:14:48] <pdub> thx dude
[19:14:53] <robertmaxrees> oh also: you never declare isMouseDown anyway.,
[19:14:53] <pdub> gonna take a break tho :P
[19:14:58] <robertmaxrees> *anywhere.
[19:15:02] <robertmaxrees> so i'd fix that, too.
[19:15:24] <pdub> dang, you rock dude
[19:15:34] <pdub> i think my brain is out of juice
[19:15:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.  that's what we're here for.
[19:31:17] <pdub> robertmaxrees: sweet, at the bottom of this http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1416/  I have mousedown and mouseover outputting to each box's text to the browser console.
[19:31:48] <pdub> robertmaxrees: so at least now i see how to get setup
[19:34:41] <pdub> robertmaxrees: omg i cant believe it works!  http://jsfiddle.net/few5E/1417/
[19:34:56] <pdub> yaaaaaayyyyy i feel so much happier
[19:35:28] <pdub> ommmggg this is awesome
[19:35:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:35:38] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> mind some feedback?
[19:36:04] <pdub> i'd love some for sure
[19:36:15] <robertmaxrees> setupBoxCloseButton - you don't need this at all.
[19:36:27] <robertmaxrees> that's another delegated handler.
[19:37:13] <pdub> robertmaxrees: hmm... i removed 'setupBoxCloseButton($('.box:last-child')); ' but then the red [X] doesn't work
[19:37:33] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to change $box.find('.boxCloseButton').click(function() { to work like the others.
[19:37:35] <pdub> robertmaxrees: You're saying I should just convert it into a delegated one?
[19:37:38] <pdub> ahhh
[19:37:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:37:41] <pdub> cool, thanks man!
[19:37:52] <robertmaxrees> also: var selectedIndex = +$selector.val()
[19:38:18] <robertmaxrees> don't do implicit coercions like this - use parseFloat or parseInt as appropriate.
[19:39:19] <pdub> ahh cool.  yeah, this is from a book -- http://www.allitebooks.com/jquery-design-patterns/ -- good to know though, as i've used parseInt before, and wasn't familiar with += for string -> integer conversion
[19:39:43] <pdub> i see what they're doing now with += though... just taking the value attribute from the html tag
[19:40:29] <robertmaxrees> *number :)
[19:40:29] <robertmaxrees> also, you reference $(".boxContainer") a few times.  why not store that in a var up top and use that var instead?
[19:40:47] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:40:50] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing += ?
[19:41:07] <robertmaxrees> += is distinct from +'some string'
[19:41:33] <pdub> oops i meant "=+" for = +$selector.val()
[19:41:38] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[19:41:53] <pdub> thanks so much for these improvements
[19:41:55] <pdub> i am making them
[19:42:02] <pdub> this is ultimately for a portfolio, so its super helpful
[19:43:40] <robertmaxrees> well, then i gotta ask:
[19:43:46] <robertmaxrees> what's with the client-side generation of stuff?
[19:47:00] <pdub> I'm doing an Express/KnexJS/PostgreSQL backend which will output these things:  Customers, projects, tasks, employees, skills. It will allow an admin to edit them.  To select multiple and hopefully act on them all at once (the selected ones) allowing to place 1+ employee box onto a task box, for example.  Or to close several boxes at once
[19:47:10] <pdub> but more, just the basic UI stuff.
[19:47:26] <robertmaxrees> so that doesn't answer my question :)_
[19:48:00] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to make sure the UI stays in sync with your server?
[19:48:03] <pdub> the clientside stuff will be generated from an get request to my express api
[19:48:16] <pdub> hmm.. pretty much yeah
[19:48:27] <pdub> er... i dunno really
[19:48:28] <robertmaxrees> ok.  because the way you have it now, there's literally no reason to do dynamic client-side rendering.
[19:48:39] <robertmaxrees> since you base it all off stuff on the page.
[19:49:10] <pdub> I was thinking I could just have the user select multiple things, and then their info is pushed into an array of these objects
[19:49:19] <pdub> and from there, the user could post that array
[19:49:24] <pdub> with a button click for example
[19:49:26] <robertmaxrees> to the server?
[19:49:31] <pdub> yep, via posting to my api
[19:49:41] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't explain the client-side rendering :)
[19:49:50] <pdub> hmm
[19:49:59] <pdub> not sure what you mean by rendering
[19:50:17] <robertmaxrees> var boxHtml = '<div class="boxsizer"><article class="box">' +
[19:50:19] <pdub> ohh like the creation of boxes?
[19:50:41] <robertmaxrees> that whole block yeah
[19:50:46] <pdub> The dropdown will have employees/projects/customers, etc.
[19:50:58] <pdub> when you select one of those, it shows you the small boxes A, B, C, D
[19:51:04] <pdub> from there, if you click one, it expands it.
[19:51:19] <pdub> with name, dates, geographic info, thumbnail perhaps
[19:51:27] <robertmaxrees> right, so.
[19:51:36] <robertmaxrees> why can't that be on the page when it first loads?
[19:51:48] <pdub> good point
[19:51:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:52:04] <pdub> mostly bc I copied a lot of this code, and then just wanted to see if I can apply the click-drag effect
[19:52:07] <robertmaxrees> i assume this is some kind of portfolio for dev stuff?
[19:52:22] <pdub> i guess i didnt have a major goal, except exploring the basic types of functionality that are possible
[19:52:40] <robertmaxrees> that's legit.  just something to think about :)
[19:52:40] <pdub> yep.  i got laid off from a biz systems analyst job recently.  so, want to spend a month or so making a portfolio
[19:52:53] <pdub> robertmaxrees: for sure, its a great point
[19:53:03] <pdub> ultimately it would work like that, you're right
[19:53:38] <pdub> robertmaxrees:  i think i wanted to give the option of having them all open, vs only some
[19:53:57] <pdub> so that you can select and inspect just a few, then highlight & move them onto a project, which creates a task
[19:54:11] <pdub> but, then again, I can just make them expandable
[19:54:23] <pdub> show them all collapsed perhaps
[19:54:29] <pdub> good thoughts man
[19:54:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you should make it truly dynamic and convert your frontend over to a more robust framework/library.
[19:55:36] <pdub> robertmaxrees: hmm... i was trying to keep it simple for the frontend of the initial project-- mostly just a crud type thing
[19:56:09] <pdub> robertmaxrees: were you thinking react, vue, or angular?
[19:56:19] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily any of those.
[19:56:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm mostly just eyeing the templating you're doing.
[19:56:30] <pdub> robertmaxrees: cool, yeah, those seem pretty hyped in my opinion
[19:56:42] <robertmaxrees> if you wind up doing much more than that, I'd look into something like those.
[19:56:47] <pdub> robertmaxrees: i'm interested in D3 since I've worked with statistics & databases a bit
[19:56:52] <robertmaxrees> or even something different like backbone + dust.
[19:57:13] <pdub> robertmaxrees: and also interested in UI.. basically ways to create internal business apps
[19:57:24] <pdub> cool, ill check those out
[19:58:02] <robertmaxrees> then you'll DEFINITELY want to start getting something like angular or vue or react under your belt.
[19:59:02] <pdub> robertmaxrees: backbone looks cool-- looks like it helps handle my  frontend's api calls
[19:59:19] <robertmaxrees> its models will, yeah.
[19:59:34] <robertmaxrees> something that rolls all your needs together might be your best bet tho.
[19:59:48] <robertmaxrees> since internal UIs don't necessarily need to be super pretty, just functional.
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> backbone's also kinda dated so (shrug)
[20:00:40] <pdub> ahh gotcha
[20:00:48] <pdub> dang man, so many frikkin things to learn
[20:01:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:01:22] <robertmaxrees> luckily, once you get one under your belt, the rest are pretty easy.
[20:04:20] <RM982> I have related code in so many different files that is difficult to create a test case but, any idea why append() could be inserting content in same random place rather than at the end of the element?
[20:06:05] <RM982> actually I'm not sure if that's the case but at least that's what I get visually
[20:06:15] <RM982> is there a way I can see the updated source?
[22:16:54] <jak2000> how to display any Hint tooltip over a cell?
