[00:07:13] <Cork> Nijjan1: how is that even remotely ontopic for this channel?
[00:12:05] <DRSK> Cork » http://wpbin.io/217cyt any idea why my line 44 won't trigger a change? Basically it seems to fire but without doing anything.. this.isMobile and this.isSmallScreen never changes using it, however using line 43 and it works as intended. Any suggestion?
[00:13:17] <Cork> DRSK: you prob want function() { self.checkDevice(); }
[00:14:07] <DRSK> Cork » so requestAnimationFrame( function() { self.checkDevice() ... ? Not quite sure where you mean I'd need to wrap the call in a function ;o
[00:14:47] <Cork> DRSK: exactly
[00:14:54] <DRSK> Oh okay thanks I'll try that
[00:15:05] <Cork> DRSK: when you send a function as a referecen you lost the this reference
[00:15:21] <Cork> so checkDevice loses the reference to self
[00:15:30] <Cork> and that breaks you
[00:15:58] <Cork> DRSK: btw you don't want to call requestAnimationFrame like that
[00:16:08] <Cork> DRSK: it won't ratelimit the updates
[00:16:24] <Cork> it will just queue a tone of requestAnimationFrame animations
[00:16:48] <DRSK> All right? I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong, tried wrapping it as you said as well but no go; doesn't change isSmallScreen when I resize the browser etc.
[00:17:22] <Cork> you want to trigger a timer
[00:17:34] <DRSK> I read a couple of resources on RAF but eventually they confused me instead
[00:17:40] <Cork> and then exit the resize event early until that timer has fired
[00:18:02] <Cork> DRSK: raf is for animations, not ratelimiting
[00:18:21] <Cork> its to trigger updates not ratelimiting
[00:18:31] <xhd> hey guys. i train jquery now but it is time to donwload th file to include in my example. i am on https://jquery.org/ but i not find a download link. anyone help please?
[00:19:04] <Cork> xhd: http://jquery.com/download/
[00:19:23] <xhd> thanks Cork
[00:19:41] <Cork> org is for the foundation not the project
[00:37:35] <gtristan> Cork, thought you might be interested to know... the <input> *is* actually visible as far as the toolkit is concerned, the problem was elsewhere
[00:38:03] <gtristan> Cork, after investigating and brainstorming in #javascript (where you may have observed), we came up with http://jsfiddle.net/350t06hL/
[00:38:39] <gtristan> The problem is the default action of .mousedown which fights with the <input> which just received explicit focus
[00:48:28] <DRSK> Cork » https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/resize that's basically the one that confused me; I can't use RAF to debounce/throttle my resize event ? I know it's intended for throttling/debouncing animations but I've read on a few different resources that you can use it on scroll and resize to throttle stuff as well but I might be wrong?
[00:49:17] <Cork> DRSK: no you've completely missed the point
[00:49:31] <DRSK> crap
[00:49:31] <Cork> requestanimationframe isn't meant to throttle anything
[00:49:44] <Cork> its closer to an event handler
[00:49:58] <Cork> "the next time you plan to draw the content of the page call me"
[00:50:02] <Omar-> good morning
[00:50:17] <Cork> if you call it 100 times it will execute 100 times before the next frame is drawn
[00:50:50] <Cork> DRSK: to rate limit an event you have to one way or another exit early for the event handler
[00:51:42] <DRSK> Cork » that's why the first example on that page is confusing me :(
[00:51:56] <DRSK> even so the text under 'example' is misleading
[00:51:57] <Cork> DRSK: ex: var processEvent = true; .on('resize', function() { if(!processEvent) { return; } processEvent = false; setTimeout(function() { processEvent = true; }, 1000) })
[00:52:19] <DRSK> Yeah so provessEvent is only true each second and therefore it'd only fire each second?
[00:52:44] <DRSK> Although I find setTimeout to be a real pain and I'd rather not depend on it, but I might've done stuff badly before to have that experience though
[00:53:14] <Cork> DRSK: what's a pain about setTimeout?
[00:53:28] <DRSK> I find it to be "unreliable" in the timing
[00:53:56] <Cork> DRSK: that example does the same thing
[00:54:15] <Cork> but in a bit more scoped solution
[00:54:22] <Cork> DRSK: if you check you have a "running" variable
[00:54:26] <Cork> it does the same thing
[00:54:41] <Cork> so yes that example works too
[00:54:53] <Cork> it won't throttle as much (you might not want to)
[00:55:13] <Cork> but the problem with how you read it is, that the throttle isn't from requestAnimationFrame
[00:55:20] <Cork> it is from if(!running) {}
[00:56:17] <DRSK> Ah, so I should just ignore RAF and basically do a setTimeout with a state-thing like running?
[00:56:35] <Cork> DRSK: you can use either just like they say
[00:56:56] <Cork> but the point is you need the if case IT is what rate limits
[00:57:09] <Cork> if you remove the boolean or anything similar you don't have a rate limit
[00:57:27] <DRSK> So going back to the pastie I made where would be a good place to have this if cases to rate limit?
[00:57:50] <Cork> ugg you have the link again?
[00:57:51] <DRSK> » http://wpbin.io/217cyt
[00:59:03] <Cork> DRSK: well it would have to be around line 40
[00:59:07] <Cork> sorry line 44
[00:59:23] <Cork> as you don't have anything wrapping the requestAnimationFrame call
[01:00:08] <Cork> and then the checkDevice or the function() {} for requestAnimationFrame would have to toggle the boolean back to not blocking
[01:00:36] <DRSK> if( !running ) { running = true; requestAnimationFrame( self.checkDevice ); } and then I can just simply set running to false in checkDevice after the vars?
[01:00:39] <DRSK> oh
[01:03:21] <DRSK> Cork » ohh now I get it!
[01:04:11] <DRSK> ahh splendid thanks a lot for the examples, explanations and taking the time looking at my example so I could put it into perspective of what I'm working on. Helped me understand it way better, thanks Cork !
[01:04:30] <Cork> np
[01:04:34] <phpcoder> hello
[01:04:45] <phpcoder> a good plugin for parellax?
[01:25:17] <Joonaa> i have an idiotic error (Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function) here, but i cant figure it out http://jsfiddle.net/50ypk4aL/
[01:26:09] <Cork> Joonaa: always quote your attribute values
[01:28:13] <Cork> Joonaa: also you're replacing $ with event
[01:28:35] <Joonaa> well that sounds more problematic
[01:28:36] <Cork> Joonaa: http://jsfiddle.net/50ypk4aL/2/
[01:29:57] <Joonaa> oh, im using wordpress as well
[01:30:14] <Joonaa> so i dont think i can just remove it?
[01:30:27] <Cork> Joonaa: any reason why you use .load instead of ready?
[01:30:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/50ypk4aL/3/
[01:30:45] <Joonaa> I need to replace text when an ajax event completes
[01:31:00] <Cork> .load doesn't guarantee that ajax calls will have executed
[01:31:25] <Joonaa> hrmm
[01:31:26] <Cork> so you have a bug there anyway
[01:35:52] <Joonaa> the ajax changes values on the page (calendar), so it should execute? unless it doesnt execute on render completetion
[01:39:17] <Joonaa> i cant include it in the calendar sources :/
[01:39:42] <hlp11> Hi #jquery.
[01:40:02] <hlp11> I need help, in preventing file uploads of X bytes.
[01:40:05] <Cork> Joonaa: .load fires when the resources linked in the html file is loaded and rendered
[01:40:22] <Cork> Joonaa: it doesn't wait for resources added by js or ajax calls
[01:40:22] <hlp11> What I have done is that subscribed to the change event of my <input type="file" />
[01:40:33] <Joonaa> ah, is there a function for render then?
[01:40:36] <hlp11> And then check file size of the file.
[01:40:41] <Cork> Joonaa: no
[01:40:51] <hlp11> Now my question is how do I prevent it, like show error and un select the uploaded file?
[01:40:57] <Cork> Joonaa: you would have to get a hook for the calender ajax response
[01:41:25] <Joonaa> can i actually do that without modifying the ajax file?
[01:41:27] <Cork> hlp11: you mean prevent uploads bigger then x bytes?
[01:41:41] <Cork> Joonaa: depends on the plugin
[01:41:45] <Cork> check the documentation
[01:41:51] <Joonaa> cheers
[01:42:19] <hlp11> Cork: Yes.
[01:42:24] <Cr0vaX> hi all
[01:42:27] <Cr0vaX> When I click "editar pedido" button I want the user to confirm or cancel, so I change the content of "botoes" class with 2 buttons "cancelar" and "confirmar", then I want to catch the "cancelar" event in order to show "editar pedido" button, but it submits the form, what am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/6x556tf2/
[01:42:41] <Cork> Joonaa: there is also an ajaxSuccess event if everything else fails
[01:42:56] <Cork> Joonaa: but it isn't limited to that ajax call, so you would have to check that
[01:43:29] <Cork> hlp11: what browser versions do you have to support?
[01:44:28] <strayArch> Why would my webpage shift the view on a menu collapse?
[01:44:46] <strayArch> also, when I change content on the page it loads to center
[01:44:48] <Uhkis> it's not floating?
[01:44:58] <Cork> hlp11: if only supporting browsers that supports the File api is ok you could use input.files[1].size
[01:44:58] <strayArch> http://stronz.co/
[01:45:09] <strayArch> Click on menu button then portfolio
[01:45:15] <Cork> hlp11: in older browsers there isn't a way to do it
[01:45:40] <Cork> hlp11: so ie>9
[01:45:49] <strayArch> Uhkis: if you collapse and uncollapse the menu button on mobile, the page shifts view
[01:46:05] <Cork> (the other vendors has supported it for so long that it shouldn't be a problem)
[01:47:34] <Uhkis> strayArch: works fine here
[01:47:52] <hlp11> Cork: sorry got disconnected
[01:47:55] <strayArch> Uhkis: Android?
[01:48:01] <Uhkis> strayArch: yes
[01:48:16] <hlp11> Is it possible to prevent file uploads of a file greater than, say X bytes ?
[01:48:41] <hlp11> I can get the size of the file by subscribing to the change event of my <input type="file" />
[01:48:49] <hlp11> but how do I prevent its uploading ?
[01:49:49] <Meir`> what's the best practice to use "scrollTop" when there is a fixed header?
[01:49:56] <Joonaa> hlp11: question was what browser versions do you have to support?
[01:50:14] <Cork> hlp11: just set val('') on the input
[01:50:15] <Meir`> to decrease the height of the header from the scrolling position?
[01:50:27] <hlp11> Joonaa: we are targeting PhoneGap for iOS
[01:50:44] <hlp11> Cork: I see. Let me try that.
[01:50:52] <Cork> hlp11: and like i said http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150115.log.html
[01:50:59] <Cork> you can get the size in modern browser
[01:51:25] <strayArch> Uhkis: So when you load the portfolio page, it doesn't load at the center of the content?
[01:51:35] <hlp11> Cork: Yes.
[01:51:40] <Uhkis> strayArch: loads completely normal
[01:51:56] <strayArch> Uhkis: I'm using android as well and just tried chrome beta... Weird. Phone restart xD
[01:51:57] <hlp11> Cork: I can get the size, no issue, just need to prevent upload of it.
[01:52:23] <Cork> hlp11: simplest might just be to mark the input field invalid
[01:52:28] <Uhkis> strayArch: tried firefox and stock browser
[01:53:09] <hlp11> Cork: How?
[01:53:35] <Cork> .setCustomValidity
[01:53:44] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement.setCustomValidity
[01:53:49] <hlp11> Cork: Okay. won't setting .val('') work though?
[01:54:05] <Cork> hlp11: depends what flow you want
[01:54:21] <hlp11> hlp11: Means?
[01:54:24] <Cork> removing the file from the field might leave the user confused
[01:55:05] <hlp11> Cork: I'll do that after showing a dialog/alert.
[01:55:33] <Cork> hlp11: ya, but the setCustomValidity is an option for doing the same thing
[01:56:12] <strayArch> Uhkis: Works fine on firefox for me as well. Still not on chrome though... Hm
[01:56:21] <hlp11> Cork: Yes, better do things the good way. Thanks.
[01:56:53] <Uhkis> strayArch: don't have chrome
[01:57:04] <Uhkis> worst browser ever :D
[01:57:31] <strayArch> Haha xD So would it be reverting to a browser default?
[01:58:32] <Uhkis> huh?
[01:59:51] <strayArch> Really a CSS question, but if something isn't defined in CSS, it is left to the browser to determine
[02:05:29] <mooncup> strayArch: the browser has a set of defaults
[02:05:51] <mooncup> but it differs between browsers
[02:06:16] <mooncup> firefox http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/html.css
[02:06:23] <mooncup> chrome/safari http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css
[02:06:28] <mooncup> ie http://www.iecss.com/
[02:08:45] <strayArch> mooncup: Thanks ^_^ internet browsers need to be more standardized, like screw drivers lol
[02:09:17] <Cr0vaX> http://jsfiddle.net/6x556tf2/1/ why  $(".cancela-addon").click() isn't fired after I click "Editar Pedido"?
[02:10:05] <Cork> Cr0vaX: $() searches for elements matching the selector
[02:10:17] <Cork> .click then loops this list and attaches click events to them
[02:10:33] <Cork> Cr0vaX: and as the element doesn't exist when you try to attach the event listener
[02:10:38] <Cork> no event listener is added
[02:10:49] <Cork> Cr0vaX: the solution is to delegate the event handler to static parent
[02:11:15] <Cork> Cr0vaX: http://jsfiddle.net/6x556tf2/2/
[02:12:13] <Cr0vaX> it works, but got a bit confused
[02:12:23] <Cork> confused?
[02:12:50] <Uhkis> it should be illegal to program in anything else than english
[02:12:57] <Cork> true
[02:13:15] <Cr0vaX> need to read about static parent(I'm not very used to use jquery)
[02:13:32] <Cork> Cr0vaX: static means a parent that isn't removed
[02:13:43] <Cork> could be $('#botoes') in your case
[02:14:20] <Cork> Cr0vaX: http://jsfiddle.net/6x556tf2/3/ a fix for the edit button too
[02:15:19] <Cr0vaX> ok, not seems more clear to me :)
[02:15:24] <Cr0vaX> ty a lot Cork
[02:16:17] <Cr0vaX> Uhkis: it's not in english, because I'm developing for internal purposes, when I develop for "the world" I use english
[02:16:30] <Cr0vaX> sorry about that
[02:16:54] <Cork> i don't allow local language comments in internal project either (or even worse variable names)
[02:17:37] <Cork> i've always disliked that since i first saw a vba script...
[02:17:58] <Cork> hello translated if/for/else... *YUCK!*
[02:18:46] <Cr0vaX> yep that's a mess, but it's complicated where I work to have everything written in english
[02:18:51] <Cr0vaX> maybe in the future :)
[02:19:43] <Cr0vaX> once again, ty Cork
[02:24:49] <jimcky> hello guys, I am writing my first ajax function with jQuery, while it works as expected, can someone take a look at it and tell me if I am doing to properly?  https://dpaste.de/Tzv3
[02:27:20] <Cork> jimcky: error not failure
[02:27:42] <Cork> jimcky: also you might want to use deferred instead of the option callbacks, makes the code easier to read
[02:28:02] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function() {}).fail(function() {})
[02:28:35] <Uhkis> needs semicolons!
[02:28:54] <Cork> Uhkis: those are optional in js
[02:29:00] <Cork> as long as you don't minify the code
[02:30:00] <jimcky> Cork, right, let me try to rewrite that :P, may I ask if it is proper to use GET for my ajax call, or should I use POST instead? I am using Django and it has tight CSRF protection, makes extra hassle to use POST so I got lazy and used GET
[02:30:17] <Uhkis> Cork: all i see is SYNTAX ERROR when someone skips semicolons :)
[02:30:34] <Cork> jimcky: taken from the code it looks like you check if a username is valid
[02:30:39] <Cork> jimcky: so ya, it SHOULD be get
[02:30:43] <Uhkis> Django explains the missing semicolons
[02:30:49] <Cork> jimcky: basically post is if you modify data on the server
[02:31:04] <Cork> or rather get my NEVER modify data
[02:31:18] <Cork> (or add)
[02:31:21] <jimcky> Uhkis, ;) I should probably use an editor that puts "!" in front of line missing semicolons
[02:31:36] <Cork> Uhkis: i do too, but it is up to the one writing the code
[02:32:35] <Cork> my brain actually has a harder time parsing code if parenthesis or semocolon is missing
[02:33:08] <Cork> (never understood why ppl hate parenthesis in code)
[02:33:18] <jimcky> Cork, it might rather be unrelated, but may I ask for a situation where we should use Ajax call to POST(modify / add ) data to server? I cannot any ATM
[02:33:27] <jimcky> I cannot think of any ATM *
[02:34:24] <Cork> jimcky: $.ajax('/add-user.php', { data: { name: "jon", last: "doe" } }).done(function(data) { console.log(data.userID); })
[02:35:03] <Cork> opps missed type: 'post' >_<'
[02:35:53] <Cork> jimcky: if the data on the server becomes different after the call, it should be put or post
[02:36:18] <bacobart> yes, get is for reading, post is for writing/modifying
[02:36:19] <Cork> if it makes no difference if to the server if the call is made or not use get
[02:37:01] <Cork> jimcky: the reason for this is two fold. 1. post sends data outside the url so it can contain much more data
[02:37:02] <jimcky> Cork, I get it now, maybe editing the playlist name on youtube does used Ajax to post the editing playlist name
[02:37:14] <Cork> 2. get calls is cached by the browser, so the server might never be queried at all
[02:37:26] <Cork> jimcky: ya
[02:37:46] <bacobart> also, if you'd allow /delete-user.php?userId=1 as a get request, you're open to attacks
[02:37:57] <Cork> OUCH
[02:38:00] <Cork> ya...
[02:38:11] <Cork> i remember those old google spider bugs :)
[02:38:21] <Cork> "my entire user data base has been cleared"
[02:38:40] <Cork> when the spider clicked all the <a>delete</a> links :)
[02:38:48] <Cork> *woops* :D
[02:38:57] <jimcky> Cork, that sounded awful :O
[02:39:05] <Cork> jimcky: ya, good old days
[02:39:09] <Uhkis> well if your delete-user.php could be ran without authentication, serves you right :D
[02:39:14] <Cork> we're talking mid late 90's here
[02:39:22] <Cork> ~97 i think
[02:39:32] <Erwat> that's an interesting question Cork
[02:39:48] <Cork> Erwat: what question?
[02:39:50] <Erwat> are you liable for leaving it open or are they liable for deleting it?
[02:40:03] <Erwat> in the computer world it seems obvious that it's completely your fault
[02:40:03] <Uhkis> definitely former
[02:40:14] <Erwat> but if you think about the real world if you leave a postbox or similar in public view
[02:40:30] <Cork> Erwat: it was clearly the fault of the site developer
[02:40:35] <Erwat> if the postbox gets destroyed you're not the one responsible and the ones who did it were the ones in teh wrong
[02:40:39] <Cork> the spec clearly state you shouldn't use get calls for that
[02:41:04] <Cork> that the spider bot happened to get into there management interface isn't "it's" fault
[02:41:08] <bacobart> get calls shouldnt modify/delete entities on the server
[02:41:09] <bacobart> simple as that
[02:41:14] <Cork> ya
[02:41:19] <Erwat> Cork: well, you say that
[02:41:33] <bacobart> the spider expects a get request to read data
[02:41:39] <Cork> but ya, it was quite the thing back then
[02:41:40] <bacobart> as how the get request is designed
[02:41:42] <Erwat> btu if you made a spider bot irl that broke something that "it shouldn't have been able to access" then it would still be the fault of the spiderbot's creator
[02:41:44] <jimcky> Cork, Uhkis, bacobart, thanks for the explanations, let me try to rewrite my function with .done and .fail.. with semicolons :P
[02:42:00] <Uhkis> hooray for semicolons!
[02:42:10] <Cork> Erwat: they actually sued (i think it was google)
[02:42:12] <Erwat> i have a hard time staying awake right now
[02:42:29] <jimcky> (I kind of passed on PHP and adopted Python because I always missed the semicolons...)
[02:42:31] <Cork> on the grounds of what you state
[02:42:32] <Cork> but they lost
[02:42:35] <Erwat> it's nto even 1pm yet and my eyes are falling shut, despite having a full night's sleep
[02:42:39] <Uhkis> jimcky: lol
[02:42:41] <Cork> and i'm happy they did
[02:42:50] <Cork> we wouldn't have any search engines today if they wan
[02:43:01] <delboy1978uk> how do i get the domain name? i have a full url but want the domain name removed from it
[02:43:07] <hlp11> hi #jquery
[02:43:13] <stompdaroach> hi u
[02:43:18] <Erwat> Cork: i understand htat
[02:43:19] <Cork> delboy1978uk: for the current page you mean?
[02:43:21] <jimcky> delboy1978uk, how about .split ?
[02:43:21] <hlp11> I have problems preventing file uploading if size is too big
[02:43:27] <Erwat> i was just thinking it's an interesting question
[02:43:36] <Cork> jimcky: there is possibly better options
[02:43:52] <Cork> Erwat: it is
[02:44:01] <Cork> and like i said it was quite the argument back then
[02:44:11] <Cork> when web spiders was a fairly new thing
[02:44:12] <hlp11> This is my code http://jsfiddle.net/fo5z1q39/
[02:44:22] <hlp11> Problem is that it can successfully detect greater file size
[02:44:41] <hlp11> but how I do make sure that the file is not submitted?
[02:44:45] <Cork> hlp11: you don't need filereader
[02:44:45] <jimcky> Cork, I can only think of this one :P, what are the other options?
[02:45:10] <Cork> jimcky: depends on where the url is
[02:45:17] <Cork> window.location.path for example
[02:45:25] <hlp11> Cork: Sorry, yes leftover.
[02:45:28] <Cork> or aTag.src.path
[02:45:39] <delboy1978uk> cheers guys i'll try that
[02:45:56] <hlp11> Cork: How do I make sure that file is not submitted/uploaded?
[02:45:58] <Cork> hlp11: could you add the missing html so the code works? (just leave action empty)
[02:46:05] <jimcky> Cork, I see, I am so indoctrinated by Python's philosophy XD
[02:46:25] <Cork> jimcky: i jump languages like mad :)
[02:46:33] <Cork> so ya, i don't get stuck like that
[02:46:40] <hlp11> hlp11: It is huge/dynamic (directly) generated by odoo (openERP)
[02:46:48] <hlp11> Cork: It is huge/dynamic (directly) generated by odoo (openERP)
[02:47:51] <Cork> uh...
[02:47:54] <Cork> no it isn't
[02:48:55] <Cork> hlp11: something like that should do it http://jsfiddle.net/fo5z1q39/1/
[02:52:08] <Cork> hlp11: just add any file and see it in action http://jsfiddle.net/fo5z1q39/2/
[02:55:37] <Joonaa> Cork: thanks! ajaxSuccess was the "perfect" solution
[02:56:59] <hlp11> Cork: Let me try.
[02:57:07] <jimcky> Cork, do you know version 2 is more readable? or is there any reason I should not writ it like that? https://dpaste.de/jEbr
[02:57:41] <jimcky> do you think*
[02:57:43] <Cork> jimcky: either works
[02:57:56] <Cork> that is just a matter of taste
[02:58:26] <Cork> i usually daisy them, but a variable work just as well
[02:58:58] <jimcky> I see, I found that style on SO and wondered which one is more proper :D
[02:59:09] <jimcky> thanks! you're awesome
[03:05:03] <hlp11> Cork: Thanks. I get it. The reason I think it is not working with me, is that button (for Submitting) isn't inside the <form> in which is our <input type="file>
[03:05:14] <hlp11> Cork: That's gotta be the issue, right?
[03:05:30] <Cork> hlp11: the submit has to be related to the form
[03:05:40] <Cork> you can use form="id-of-form" if it isn't inside
[03:34:11] <fas3r> Hello
[03:34:33] <fas3r> does serialize() need to be use in a specific way ?
[03:34:52] <Cork> fas3r: it needs to be called on a set of fields or a form element
[03:35:44] <fas3r> Cork: alright, but I need to use it on the submit only or it can be use on any kind of event ( click for example ) ?
[03:36:05] <Cork> fas3r: it has nothing to do with events
[03:36:13] <fas3r> alright.
[03:36:45] <fas3r> because I don't get the data from the form ... actually it's not returning anything. I will dig them. Thanks for your time as usual :)
[03:36:56] <fas3r> then*
[03:38:19] <fas3r> hooo maybe it's because I was using serializearray :D
[03:38:34] <Cork> fas3r: serializearray should work too
[03:38:53] <Cork> actaully serialize uses serializeArray (and passes it though $.param)
[03:41:40] <fas3r> ho it works ...
[03:42:26] <fas3r> Cork: do you use by any chance form-wizard ?
[03:42:50] <Cork> fas3r: i usually just use jquery core + a few query ui widgets
[03:46:19] <fas3r> Cork: alright.
[04:11:02] <delboy1978uk> argh! trying to get all my form values, can anyone help? http://pastie.org/9833177
[04:11:32] <Cork> O_o'
[04:11:42] <Cork> delboy1978uk: $('form').serializeArray();
[04:11:43] <Cork> done
[04:11:46] <fas3r> :D
[04:11:47] <fas3r> hahaha
[04:11:53] <fas3r> I wanted to say the same thing :P
[04:12:02] <Cork> delboy1978uk: don't do it manually...
[04:12:45] <Cork> delboy1978uk: as long as you build valid <form> forms that should work without a problem
[04:14:00] <delboy1978uk> #thats it?
[04:14:05] <delboy1978uk> thats freaking awesome!
[04:14:05] <Cork> ya
[04:14:09] * delboy1978uk tries
[04:14:16] <Cork> well you could replace 'form' woth '#id-of-form')
[04:14:29] <Cork> but ya that is all you need
[04:15:05] <Cork> delboy1978uk: it is important that all form fields has a correct name="" attribute though
[04:15:15] <Cork> or you will have problem with sending the collection
[04:15:37] <delboy1978uk> yeah thats fine :)
[04:16:21] <delboy1978uk> Great Success! :-D
[04:16:33] <delboy1978uk> thanks guys! :-D
[04:16:39] <Cork> heh np
[04:16:44] <esko> hi guys, please bare with me, im like day 3 into my javascript :) could someone take a look at this and explain how i could get all the k+v from each in data.result; http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/2/
[04:17:24] <esko> since theres objects in the object (?) i have too loop that out as well i guess
[04:17:37] <Cork> esko: you have to recursively loop the objects
[04:17:57] <Cork> if(typeof(v) == "object") {  }
[04:17:57] <delboy1978uk> esko: use your browser console log http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/2/
[04:18:20] <Cork> delboy1978uk: i don't think it is just for view
[04:19:53] <esko> delboy1978uk: i know i could do that, thanks. eventually i want each object in data.results failure to be displayed with keys+values
[04:22:31] <esko> Cork: would you care to show me at jsfiddle?
[04:22:56] <Cork> working on it :)
[04:23:36] <esko> <3
[04:23:43] <delboy1978uk> look here esko http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/3/
[04:25:52] <BinaryKitten> delboy1978uk - http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/4/ (added protection)
[04:26:39] <Cork> esko: http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/5/
[04:26:53] <esko> Cork: ah, most excellent :D
[04:27:12] <Cork> BinaryKitten: you don't need that for $.each
[04:27:16] <Cork> it does that by default
[04:27:41] <BinaryKitten> Cork the .each was on the parent
[04:27:57] <BinaryKitten> the .hasOwnProperty for child property of the result item
[04:28:43] <Cork> not sure why that would be of interest...
[04:29:14] <Cork> console.log swallows undefined calls
[04:29:39] <BinaryKitten> just because failure may not exist.. and trying to use it when it doesn't exist would fail.. and wasn't just thinking of console.log but future usage..
[04:29:43] <Cork> esko: if there is something you don't understand in the code just ask
[04:30:12] <Cork> BinaryKitten: that code kinda depends on console.log as it doesn't recurs
[04:30:48] <BinaryKitten> Cork i'm confused but not that it matters
[04:30:56] <Cork> esko: you could add $.isArray to the mix if you want to make it write arrays in a prettier way
[04:31:09] <Cork> BinaryKitten: this was what the question was about http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/5/
[04:31:14] <Cork> and .each can't solve that
[04:31:41] <Cork> esko: opps i just saw i missed the key for nested objects :x
[04:32:30] <Cork> esko: there fixed http://jsfiddle.net/qzh41pha/6/
[04:34:16] <delboy1978uk> BinaryKitten: ah cool, didnt know that one either
[04:40:47] <nardev_> hello, how can i select elements user-id="14"  user-id="156" .. etc and hide them except by adding them one after another like this ? "user-id=14,user-id=156...."
[04:43:59] <esko> Thanks Cork, i'll look into what i dont understand :)
[04:45:12] <Omar-> nardev_ give all them the same class and then select them $(".class-name").hide();
[04:45:30] <nardev_> Omar-: unfortunately that is not possible i wish it is :D
[04:45:59] <nardev_> i only have the array of numbers and each element with that number should be hidden
[04:46:50] <Cork> nardev_: $('tag-name[id]').filter(function() { return +this.id > 13 && +this.id < 157; })
[04:46:58] <Cork> though ya, its a horrible thing to do
[04:47:26] <Cork> nardev_: also you shouldn't have use the id attribute for this to start with
[04:47:35] <nardev_> Cork: but it's not one range, it's random numbers
[04:47:42] <Cork> oh,  wait the name is user-id...
[04:47:53] <Cork> nardev_: that is even worse
[04:48:05] <Cork> can you at all affect the attribute name?
[04:48:12] <nardev_> I can
[04:48:16] <Cork> cause it SHOULD have been data-user-id
[04:48:20] <nardev_> but i can't "sort them"
[04:48:28] <nardev_> in "groups" at the beginning
[04:48:31] <Cork> never EVER create random attributes outside the data- prefix
[04:48:43] <nardev_> Cork: it's user ID's
[04:48:50] <Cork> doesn't matter
[04:49:00] <Cork> the attribute "user-id" isn't valid
[04:49:01] <nardev_> it's not random but it's not range definitely
[04:49:17] <Cork> nardev_: the name, not the content
[04:49:18] <nardev_> Cork: ok, whatever, i delete that attribute
[04:49:29] <Cork> nardev_: just prefix it, that's fine
[04:49:57] <nardev_> you mean "  id="userid_X"
[04:50:05] <Cork> no
[04:50:12] <Cork> <div data-user-id="14">
[04:50:31] <Cork> you can't use it as an id anyway so it is pointless
[04:50:53] <nardev_> ok, what do i get like that, how do i select divs with data-user-id  14, 66, 35 and 198?
[04:51:18] <Cork> nardev_: so $('div[data-user-id]').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('user-id'), numbers) > -1; });
[04:51:26] <Cork> that is the best selector you can make
[04:51:31] <Cork> its still quite horrible
[04:51:42] <nardev_> Cork: ok
[04:51:48] <nardev_> i hate inArray
[04:51:51] <nardev_> things :(
[04:51:55] <Cork> well you don't have much of a choice
[04:52:22] <nardev_> Cork: you are often here?
[04:52:28] <Cork> nardev_: it could be quite a bit better if you could give all the element you care about a class
[04:52:32] <nardev_> i think that you already helped me once before
[04:52:35] <Cork> so you can replace the div part with a class
[04:52:42] <Cork> nardev_: i am
[04:53:01] <Cork>  $('.target-class[data-user-id]')
[04:53:14] <Cork> or even $('.target-class')
[04:53:17] <Cork> if you can do that
[04:53:23] <Cork> (the filter is still needed)
[04:53:25] <nardev_> Cork: i can do that
[04:53:33] <nardev_> it's actually <tr>
[04:53:36] <nardev_> just rows
[04:53:40] <nardev_> i can add anything
[04:53:47] <nardev_> but i can't add "group id" in there
[04:53:52] <Cork> nardev_: basically you want to limit the set $() generates as far as possible
[04:53:58] <nardev_> because "group-id" i get as an separate array
[04:54:01] <Cork> so that .filter takes as little time to run as it can
[04:54:51] <Cork> but ex $('#table > tbody > tr') would work fine
[04:55:27] <nardev_> Cork: thank you.. i think this could work although i think that you didn't get me exactly ...
[04:55:52] <Cork> nardev_: i think i know what you're trying to do
[04:56:14] <Cork> nardev_: and ppl end to want to shove that into "id" or "rel"
[04:56:31] <Cork> but now days we have data-* and it is meant for that stuff
[04:57:03] <nardev_> i have multidimensional array   1=> 1,45,3,34,5  2=>6,54,6785,43,234  etc... and i have list of users, so if i want to show only users in first "sub" array with ids 1=> 1,45,3,34,5
[04:57:25] <nardev_> ok, i didn't know that "data-" "rule"
[04:58:57] <Cork> nardev_: so do arr[0] for the $.inArray filter
[04:59:11] <nardev_> yep...
[04:59:12] <Cork> btw arrays can't start at 1
[05:05:13] <daslicht> what is the best way to animate an item by percentage ?
[05:05:43] <daslicht> I have a scaleable scene here and I need to animate elements within it
[05:06:06] <daslicht> essentially its just a picture which scales proportionally according to the browser width
[05:06:24] <daslicht> and I have to animate elments above that image regarding its size
[05:06:29] <daslicht> so px wise wont work huh
[05:20:38] <Cork> daslicht: you can grab the px info of the element and animate with that
[05:20:55] <daslicht> sounds like a lot of work
[05:20:57] <Cork> though if they are to stay positioned after the animation you want to convert it back to percent
[05:21:00] <Cork> or it will shift
[05:21:05] <Cork> it kinda is
[05:21:09] <daslicht> :)
[05:21:11] <Cork> not extreamly much
[05:21:13] <Cork> but a bit
[05:21:19] <daslicht> i try to animate by %
[05:21:28] <Cork> .position() will get you the px value of top left
[05:21:43] <Cork> and height()/width() gets you the px value of the dimentions
[05:21:44] <daslicht> any drawbackas of using % ?
[05:21:57] <daslicht> the items will not stay in position :)
[05:22:07] <daslicht> i have several items here
[05:22:07] <Cork> even while it animate?
[05:22:24] <daslicht> no just when somone decides to resize the browser
[05:22:28] <Cork> exactly
[05:22:39] <daslicht> anything agians using % ?
[05:22:43] <daslicht> against
[05:22:48] <Cork> browser sucks at doing it well
[05:22:59] <daslicht> the web suxx lol
[05:23:00] <Cork> but if you're ok with it jittering around a bit sure
[05:23:04] <daslicht> heh
[05:23:08] <daslicht> i play around
[05:23:12] <daslicht> thank you !
[05:23:55] <Cork> but to be precise some browsers has problems with precision in percent (*cough* webkit *cough*)
[05:23:57] <Cork> but ya...
[05:24:41] <Cork> triden is a little better but still not grate
[05:25:00] <Cork> only one that actually does it semi decent is gecho
[05:25:10] <Cork> but they still fail at times
[05:29:28] <Nicolas_> Hi I am looking for someone that could help me out for free or for a small payment or just point me to some good documentation that I can use to do this on my own. http://jsfiddle.net/8mnQR/225/ — Short brief: When you click on the product the price should be added in the total price and the description should be added in the list at the bottom. When you select multiple items the description is stacked as a list and the total price is calculated. You
[05:29:29] <Nicolas_> can deseelect items and than they will be gone from the list and the totla price.
[05:30:20] <Cork> Nicolas_: please separate out the question from the backstory
[05:31:15] <Nicolas_> Ok
[05:31:34] <daslicht> Cork: http://jsbin.com/daguziwaxa/1, looks like animate does not animate both properties at the same time?
[05:31:54] <daslicht> the heighs seams to be animated after the position has been animated ?
[05:32:01] <daslicht> click on teh ipad on teh couch :)
[05:32:34] <Cork> daslicht: you want to use transform
[05:32:42] <Cork> it makes those things MUCH simpler
[05:32:44] <daslicht> ok let me google
[05:32:45] <Cork> and when you'
[05:32:47] <daslicht> :D
[05:32:49] <Cork> *'re at it
[05:32:59] <Cork> you might want to use css3 transision :)
[05:33:24] <Cork> ?g mdn transform
[05:33:25] <b-ot> Cork: transform - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[05:33:43] <Cork> ?g mdn transision
[05:33:44] <b-ot> Cork: transition - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition
[05:34:24] <coachz> hi
[05:34:48] <daslicht> shall i use any animation framework for this or just but writing teh required css and replace the classes on click ?
[05:35:36] <Cork> daslicht: exactly :)
[05:35:37] <daslicht> http://visionmedia.github.io/move.js/ ?
[05:35:50] <Cork> you don't really need a framework css3 has it all built in
[05:35:55] <daslicht> aye
[05:35:57] <coachz> How to convert a JS object that has associative array type data to an associative array that I can loop over and sort please ?
[05:36:20] <Cork> coachz: associative arrays is a php term
[05:36:28] <Cork> coachz: js has objects or arrays
[05:36:53] <Cork> if you want to create an array of the values in an object you do Object.values(obj)
[05:37:05] <coachz> my js object looks like this  http://i.imgur.com/WUPNTBv.png
[05:37:06] <Cork> and same for .keys
[05:37:15] <coachz> i need to loop over it and sort it by value please
[05:37:18] <Cork> ugg don't show code in images
[05:37:21] <Cork> ?paste
[05:37:22] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:37:29] <esko> Cork: now, i need to display an glyph depending on the name of data.results.v.X (could be success|failure|syntax_error). How would i inside this code determine/test something like that?
[05:38:00] <coachz> chrome console doesn't let me copy it
[05:38:06] <coachz> hence the image
[05:38:22] <Cork> esko: you mean like if(obj.failure !== undefied) { /*add icon */ } ?
[05:38:55] <gtristan> coachz, console.log (JSON.stringify (obj))
[05:38:57] <gtristan> :)
[05:39:10] <Cork> ya
[05:39:22] <coachz> ahh
[05:39:23] <Cork> coachz: anyway i already answered the question
[05:40:09] <coachz>  arrLocations = Object.values(data.locations);   hmm TypeError: undefined is not a function
[05:40:25] <Cork> alternatively you can do something like $.map(obj, function(value, key) { return [key, value]; })
[05:40:36] <Cork> and then sort on the second array value
[05:41:24] <coachz> how come this isn't working please?  arrLocations = Object.values(data.locations);
[05:41:29] <coachz> is that wrong ?
[05:41:44] <coachz> oh wait
[05:42:28] <Cork> bah .values isn't a js command
[05:43:28] <Cork> hmm annoying i was quite sure there was...
[05:43:49] <Cork> coachz: so $.map(obj, function(value) { return value; });
[05:44:07] <Cork> but you prob want the alternative solution
[05:44:17] <Cork> as you lose the keys if you to a flat array
[05:44:33] <coachz> yes that got me into the array, now can i sort it by value Sir Cork ?
[05:44:46] <Cork> ya, but drop the sir
[05:44:54] <coachz> :-)
[05:46:33] <coachz> the resulting array is http://laravel.io/bin/KkqKV
[05:46:40] <coachz> not really associative anymore
[05:47:18] <Cork> coachz: that is the point
[05:47:24] <Cork> you don't have associative arrays
[05:47:25] <coachz> my goal is to loop over the sorted data
[05:47:28] <Cork> its a php term
[05:47:39] <coachz> i'm populating a select drop down with key and value
[05:47:45] <Cork> you can't sort objects and if you don't have a list of values it is an object
[05:48:16] <Cork> coachz: a normal solution for solving this is to create an array of objects
[05:48:21] <Cork> [{}, {}, {}, {}]
[05:48:27] <Cork> then you won't have these problems
[05:48:37] <coachz> ahh
[05:49:13] <Cork> [{ value: "1", display: "Somehing goes here"}, { value:"3a", display: "something else"}, {}, {}]
[05:49:13] <coachz> so i need to create an array of objects directly from the object
[05:49:38] <Cork> coachz: just have the server do it before it generates the json
[05:49:57] <coachz> ahh i can try that, thanks as always Cork
[05:50:03] <Cork> then you can just do .sort(function(a,b) and reach into the object
[05:50:20] <coachz> excellent
[05:50:52] <Cork> but ya, i did the same mistake when i went from php to a sane language ^^'
[05:50:59] <Cork> php really messes things up there
[05:51:30] <Cork> most languages doesn't allow objects/maps/collections to be sorted
[05:52:37] <coachz> my php currently has  array(1=>'Home Office', '10A'=> 'Tahoe'....  no idea how i convert that to the form needed though
[05:53:41] <coachz> seems like the lack of assoc arrays in js is a weakness
[05:53:46] <coachz> forcing me to go back to php
[05:54:17] <Cork> array(Array('value'=>1, display=>'Home Office')...
[05:54:44] <Cork> coachz: like i said associated arrays only exist in php
[05:54:48] <Cork> no other language has them
[05:54:53] <coachz> ahh
[05:54:54] <Cork> especially ones you can sort
[05:55:35] <Cork> actually many languages explicitly scrambles the order
[05:56:08] <coachz> yeah i'm pretty lost
[05:56:19] <coachz> back in php voodoo
[06:02:31] <coachz> progress. thanks Cork !
[06:02:39] <Cork> np
[06:02:52] <coachz> does {} in JS always mean object ?
[06:02:55] <Cork> yes
[06:03:02] <coachz> i did not know that :-(
[06:03:06] <Cork> well
[06:03:10] <Cork> actually no ^^'
[06:03:13] <Cork> it can be a block too
[06:03:19] <coachz> sure
[06:03:21] <Cork> like if() { }
[06:03:27] <coachz> but when data is in it
[06:03:40] <Cork> but { <something>:<something else> } is always an object
[06:03:46] <coachz> got it
[06:04:07] <Cork> coachz: well { let a = 1; } has data but is still a block :)
[06:04:25] <coachz> right :-)
[06:05:08] <brahdude> Does anyone know how I can use Jquery + Ajax to fetch data from a JSON file and generate a html table from it
[06:05:55] <Cork> brahdude: fetch the json loop the data structure and create the elements
[06:06:13] <Cork> just make sure you don't append them to the page before you've created all of them
[06:06:22] <Cork> (it kills performance to append in a loop)
[06:06:41] <daslicht> @cork: http://jsbin.com/xozoki
[06:06:42] <daslicht> tada
[06:06:44] <daslicht> :)
[06:06:54] <Cork> nice
[06:06:57] <brahdude> Thanks, might have an idea of fetching and creating the elemtn but can you refer me to an example of looping the data structure
[06:07:05] <daslicht> thank you for the hint
[06:07:09] <daslicht> look nice
[06:07:29] <Cork> brahdude: $.each(data.rows, function() {})
[06:07:50] <Cork> ya trarnsision makes the animation gpu animated
[06:07:54] <brahdude> Cheers Cork
[06:07:56] <Cork> and it avoids reflows of the page
[06:08:02] <Cork> so it speeds things up quite a bit
[06:08:56] <Cork> gpu animated??? that's a new one  XD
[06:09:00] <Cork> *gpu accelerated
[06:09:55] <Tomasso> is there some event to detect "stop editing an input after 1 or 2 seconds" ?
[06:10:04] <Cork> no
[06:10:15] <Cork> you would have to do that with a setTimeout
[06:13:43] <Tomasso> Cork: thank you xD le me check
[06:15:13] <Cork> Tomasso: var delayed; .on('input', function() { clearTimeout(delayed); delayed = setTimeout(function() { /* delayed */ }, 2000); })
[06:15:40] <Cork> the delayed code only runs after 2 seconds of inactivity
[06:17:57] <Tomasso> thanx! xD
[06:18:21] <coachz> Cork, can i sort my array of objects without creating a function or is that required ?
[06:18:33] <Cork> coachz: required
[06:18:40] <coachz> ok
[06:18:43] <Cork> .sort has a default action to sort the array
[06:19:06] <Cork> but as you have to go one step in to find the value you want to sort on you have to create the function
[06:19:21] <Cork> coachz: don't forget that sort wants a return number -1 0 or 1
[06:19:23] <Cork> not a boolean
[06:19:44] <coachz> so i need this? http://laravel.io/bin/mGloW
[06:19:49] <Cork> (a is smaller then b, same, a is bitter then a)
[06:20:07] <Cork> yup
[06:20:20] <coachz> lot of work to populate a dropdown
[06:20:21] <Cork> you can create the function inline if you like
[06:20:37] <coachz> if  i knew how :-)
[06:20:50] <Cork> coachz: .sort(function() {})
[06:22:49] <coachz> um yeah i'm not that smart apparently
[06:27:09] <coachz> says sort is not a function  console.log(data.locations.sort(compare));
[06:27:16] <coachz> i built the compare function
[06:27:20] <Cork> then your array isn't an array
[06:27:33] <Cork> check the json it should be [{}, {}, {}]
[06:27:46] <Cork> and not { "1": {} } for example
[06:28:34] <coachz> http://laravel.io/bin/GyoO0
[06:28:48] <coachz> taht's what i generated from php
[06:28:55] <coachz> and shows in console log
[06:29:13] <Cork> coachz: is php setting the correct content type?
[06:29:25] <Cork> content-type: application/json ?
[06:29:49] <coachz> no idea, i'm just returning this data array from an ajax call
[06:30:06] <Cork> uh what?
[06:30:21] <Cork> you should know if you set the content-type header or not
[06:30:32] <Cork> if you aren't it means you're sending the wrong one
[06:30:46] <coachz> i just make an ajax call and the data comes back and i use it
[06:31:02] <coachz> i'm not setting any content-type header
[06:31:03] <Cork> coachz: ok then your php is sending text/html not json
[06:31:26] <Cork> header('Content-Type: application');
[06:31:32] <Cork> call that before you echo anything
[06:31:38] <Cork> and things should work a lot better
[06:32:07] <coachz> ok i give it a try
[06:32:52] <Erwat> Cork: is there anything you don't know? can you answer a medical question for me?
[06:33:00] <Cork> lol
[06:33:12] <Cork> Erwat: to some degree sure
[06:33:23] <Cork> my mom works in that area :)
[06:33:36] <Cork> but i don't know many of the english terms though
[06:33:40] <Erwat> can a transient ischemic attack be diagnosed months after it happened? would it be worth it to even try if it were possible?
[06:34:08] <coachz> line 21 http://laravel.io/bin/XyDqO
[06:34:13] <Erwat> transient ischemic attack is a "ministroke", it's essentially a stroke but the cause gets solved and usually no permanent damage happens
[06:34:35] <Cork> wait
[06:34:36] <coachz> and i have the compare function http://laravel.io/bin/NkoxK
[06:35:02] <Cork> coachz: what does typeof(data.locations) say?
[06:35:30] <Cork> returning the array seams a bit weird
[06:35:35] <Cork> your using a framework?
[06:35:45] <Cork> if yes then you most likely don't need the header
[06:35:52] <Cork> cause the framework prob does the magic
[06:35:54] <coachz> i'm using laravel
[06:36:04] <Cork> never even heared of it ^^'
[06:36:08] <coachz> typeof returns string
[06:36:21] <Cork> ok so the framework is breaking things
[06:36:45] <coachz> lovely
[06:36:48] <Cork> might want to look into how to get it to do that correctly
[06:36:59] <coachz> what should typeof be
[06:37:09] <coachz> array ?
[06:37:10] <Cork> object
[06:37:16] <coachz> array of objects
[06:37:19] <coachz> was my goal
[06:37:28] <Cork> no typeof shows both array and objects as object
[06:37:36] <coachz> oh great
[06:37:36] <Cork> (don't ask it's a js thing :D)
[06:37:43] <coachz> i'm too old for this
[06:37:56] <coachz> i need a job driving car parts around town
[06:38:00] <Cork> anyway you can spackel over the error with $.parseJSON(data)
[06:38:18] <Cork> WAIT
[06:38:25] <Cork> lol i just saw the error
[06:38:30] <Cork> you generate the object by hand
[06:38:44] <Cork> coachz: you should use array instead of line 6
[06:39:01] <Cork> and then use json_encode() on the array
[06:39:11] <Cork> then you should get the correct result
[06:40:19] <Cork> actually you shouldn't use json_encode as the framework does that
[06:40:26] <Cork> anyway you double convert it to json
[06:40:30] <Cork> and that is causing the problem
[06:40:37] * coachz takes a deep breath
[06:40:55] <coachz> so this needs changing? http://laravel.io/bin/9vq1v
[06:41:00] <Cork> wondered how data.locations could be a string when data wasn't :)
[06:41:20] <Cork> coachz: 4-10 needs to be replaced ya
[06:41:47] <coachz> so i don't want this format? [{ value: "1", display: "Somehing goes here"}
[06:42:00] <Cork> you want a php array of php associated arrays
[06:42:22] <coachz> hmm
[06:43:07] <Cork> $locations = array(); $locations[] = array("a" => "b", "c" => "d");
[06:43:21] <coachz> are you ready to kill me yet ?
[06:43:31] <Cork> hmm?
[06:43:43] <Erwat> coachz: Cork doesn't do that
[06:43:48] <Erwat> he only has one function: to help others
[06:43:52] <Cork> lol
[06:43:55] <coachz> hehe, he's amazing
[06:43:57] <Cork> i have a FUNCTION now? :D
[06:44:03] <coachz> rofl
[06:44:14] <coachz> he's more patient than me
[06:44:22] <Cork> i hope i don't get a stacktrace
[06:44:37] <coachz> haha
[06:48:17] <Cork> Erwat: http://i.imgur.com/B5tmJ2K.jpg
[06:48:23] <Cork> just got that one sent to me... >_>
[06:49:40] <coachz> don't want your hand to get in that things way
[06:49:49] <Cork> ya...
[06:49:56] <Erwat> Cork: lol, looks safe
[06:50:00] <Cork> or the wall...
[06:54:30] <daslicht> @cork: can you cain css3 transitions? sothat one has been finished the next is fired ?
[06:55:01] <Cork> cain?
[06:55:05] <daslicht> chain
[06:55:07] <Cork> ah
[06:55:15] <Cork> no
[06:55:35] <Cork> but they run by the same clock so they always stay in sync
[06:55:43] <Cork> so use transision-delay
[06:55:49] <daslicht> isee
[06:56:34] <daslicht> thanks
[06:56:41] <Cork> np
[06:57:47] <daslicht> hm how do i delay a transition whcih animated teh same property?
[06:57:53] <daslicht> eg
[06:58:13] <daslicht> i like to move it down and than again up?
[06:58:15] <coachz> now i get object for typeof(data.locations)
[06:58:36] <Cork> coachz: nice, then you should be able to use .sort
[06:58:52] <coachz> array("1"=>"HOME OFFICE","10"=>"TAHOE","10A"=>"CALIFORNIA DREAMING AUGUSTA",
[06:58:54] <Cork> daslicht: you mean one is for when you add the class and one when you remove?
[06:59:20] <daslicht> no i have a animation which zooms in an object
[06:59:31] <daslicht> sone sec
[06:59:40] <daslicht> http://jsbin.com/qazofa/15
[07:00:05] <daslicht> the ipad is zoomed in, and after its zoomed in i need to slide it up again intop the view
[07:00:15] <daslicht> after replacing teh image with another :)
[07:00:29] <Cork> daslicht: have a look at animate it might be what you want to do
[07:00:36] <Cork> and @key-frame
[07:00:45] <Cork> not fully sure what you want to do but that might be it
[07:00:50] <Cork> opps @keyframe
[07:02:32] <brahdude> Cork, can u debug my js for a sec
[07:02:46] <Cork> brahdude: depend
[07:03:06] <Cork> ask the question and link the code and someone might have an answer
[07:04:26] <Xatenev> heya peeps
[07:04:46] <Xatenev> hows'a goin
[07:04:48] * jphase waves
[07:04:53] <brahdude> thanks, i just got this code from stackoverflow and im trying to make it work locally but i cant figure out where im going wrong the link is http://micro.glark.io/#JOMxhCevY9
[07:05:07] * Xatenev waves back
[07:05:07] <Xatenev> =D
[07:05:44] <Cork> brahdude: much code is broken and pure bad on so
[07:05:48] <Cork> so be careful with that
[07:05:51] <Yettie> how can I show an alert(data) as website, while changing the old html to the new html ?
[07:06:04] <Xatenev> Cork: much code is broken?
[07:06:13] <Cork> Yettie: simple you can't
[07:06:28] <Cork> Yettie: alert is execution blocking
[07:06:30] <Xatenev> (only if you pick the lowest score answers maybe..) :D
[07:06:35] <Cork> you can't do anything while it is visible
[07:07:12] <Cork> Xatenev: yes, many answers is very inefficient at best and straight out wrong much of the time
[07:07:23] <Xatenev> Hm maybe in the JS stuff more
[07:07:34] <brahdude> Aha
[07:07:35] <Xatenev> when im searching for PHP stuff, I keep getting good answers and hints
[07:07:35] <ccmonster> anyone used wysihtml5? I'm having trouble handling the blur even in the editor
[07:07:38] <Cork> Xatenev: i'm talking about the "choosen answers"
[07:07:43] <Xatenev> hm
[07:07:47] <jphase> Xatenev: I agree with Cork - while they "work" they're often written in a fashion that will break with scalable sites of large traffic :|
[07:07:50] <Xatenev> for me they appear honestly quite good mostly
[07:08:05] <Xatenev> sure its not the best way, but it works and you can easily improve it
[07:08:12] <jphase> ^ agreed
[07:08:20] <Xatenev> I dont think the choosen answers have to be the 1000% correct best super perfect solutions
[07:08:31] <Xatenev> its more a fast solution to get something started on ur problem
[07:08:34] <Xatenev> IMHO^^
[07:08:37] <Yettie> Cork: if I empty html and fill html with this alerted data, it won't work ?
[07:08:40] <Cork> Xatenev: for a starter, just check for how many answers you ahve where they want you to use .attr('disabled', '') in jq 1.9+
[07:08:52] <coachz> Cork, line 8 doesn't return anything  http://laravel.io/bin/6LEQP
[07:09:14] <Cork> coachz: console.log(a,b)
[07:09:20] <coachz> k
[07:09:21] <Cork> don't force it to be strings
[07:09:50] <Xatenev> its funny how ppl keep writing to cork directly instead of just asking into the channel
[07:09:55] <Xatenev> hes probably something like a helping angel
[07:09:56] <Xatenev> :P
[07:09:59] <Cork> coachz: looks like you went back to the original associated array
[07:10:07] <Cork> coachz: that is still the wrong thing to do
[07:10:18] <coachz> you said to do that
[07:10:22] <Xatenev> mb he can fly o>O
[07:10:37] <brahdude> True Xatenev haha
[07:10:38] <Cork> no i said locations = array(); locasions[] = array() <-- associated;
[07:10:41] <Cork> that is NOT the same
[07:10:41] <Yettie> Xatenev :D
[07:10:54] <Xatenev> :D
[07:10:58] <Cork> opps locasions == locations
[07:12:12] <coachz> http://laravel.io/bin/XyDqq
[07:12:17] <coachz> i built it as you described
[07:12:18] <Xatenev> !showuscork
[07:12:18] <Xatenev> http://www.hornetbuzz.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Angel1.jpg hes fighting the problems :D
[07:14:21] <Xatenev> Obv it wasn't as funny as expected :|
[07:15:11] <Yettie> http://pastebin.com/9SRKdeuR won't work ?
[07:15:50] <coachz> the php side dumps this http://laravel.io/bin/Nkoxe
[07:18:18] <coachz> Cork disappeared ?
[07:18:40] <coachz> oh dear
[07:18:44] <Cork> coachz: sorry busy
[07:18:54] <coachz> sorry
[07:19:27] <coachz> isn't this what I need on php side ?  http://laravel.io/bin/Nkoxe
[07:20:06] <DRSK> How could I use .filter( elem.next(), elem.prev() ) ?
[07:20:39] <DRSK> .filter( elem.next() ).filter( elem.prev() ) doesn't work
[07:22:12] <Yettie> Xatenev: that was a funny one :D
[07:24:19] <hlvwrk> o_O
[07:26:35] <coachz> Can anyone tell me what my data needs to look like for sort(compare) to work ?
[07:26:52] <coachz> i'm 3 hours into this and getting very frustrated
[07:27:42] <coachz> my data currently looks like this in php array ( 0 => 'array("1"=>"HOME OFFICE","10"=>"TAHOE","10A"=>"CALIFORNIA DREAMING AUGUSTA","11"=>"TAVERA AT PHIPPS")',)
[07:29:33] <Nicolas_> Hi, anyone that can help me with make a sum with numbers that you click on?
[07:30:45] <coachz> and the channel went dead
[07:31:07] <Yettie> because it was a laravel channel :D
[07:31:20] <coachz> wot ?
[07:31:39] <notchris> I have this small bit of jquery: http://pastebin.com/qjP1NJM7
[07:31:47] <notchris> Clicking navbar-toggle disabled body scrolling
[07:31:56] <notchris> I want to re-enable it when clicking again
[07:32:03] <coachz> Yettie: ?
[07:32:04] <Cork> DRSK: you need to wrap the function calls in anonymous functions (i think i told you this yesterday)
[07:32:17] <notchris> Via: $("body").disablescroll(“undo");
[07:32:28] <coachz> Cork: have you lost the desire to help me ?
[07:32:40] <Cork> coachz: no i just got back
[07:32:55] <Cork> but ya, the channel is meant for jquery questions not php
[07:33:13] <coachz> i'm asking what format the data needs to be in for sort to work
[07:33:16] <Cork> (and i will be leaving for the day in a few minutes)
[07:33:18] <Nicolas_> The numbers should sum up when clikcing on them not making the whole some direct as now: http://jsfiddle.net/8mnQR/226/
[07:33:31] <DRSK> Well, I simply did test = elem.prev().add( elem.next() ) and that seems to work doing filter( test ) but unfortunately I'm unable to use these filtered elements in a .not( ) for some weird reason
[07:33:35] <Nicolas_> Actually the same as clicking on the description
[07:33:36] <Cork> coachz: an array of objects like i said
[07:33:43] <Cork> coachz: string or number both works
[07:33:50] <coachz> you said an array or arrays earlier
[07:33:57] <coachz> which one is it
[07:34:18] <Cork> coachz: an array of objects with string or numbers as the values of the object values yes
[07:34:34] <coachz> is this wrong ? http://laravel.io/bin/Nkoxe#1
[07:34:47] <Cork> meaning [{ a:1 }, { a:"b" }] both work
[07:35:06] <Cork> definitely looks very wrong ya
[07:35:13] <Cork> your putting the php code inside a string
[07:35:34] <Yettie> and no ; at the end
[07:36:02] <coachz> so for   1a: Dave, 32b: Sam,  what should the format be in JS ?
[07:36:31] <coachz> my goal is to sort on the names and populate a drop down with the numbers as values and the names displayed
[07:36:55] <Cork> coachz: [{ value: "1a", display: "Dave" }, { value: "32b", display: "Sam"}]
[07:37:07] <Cork> coachz: but you don't create this by structuring a string!
[07:37:15] <coachz> so how
[07:37:37] <Cork> like i said you create an array of associated arrays (in php)
[07:37:48] <Cork> i've even given you the code...
[07:38:37] <coachz> paste please
[07:38:50] <Cork> it was a one liner...
[07:39:09] <Cork> $locations = array(); $locations[] = array("a" => "b", "c" => "d");
[07:39:21] <coachz> but i have to loop over it
[07:39:24] <coachz> to build it
[07:39:26] <Cork> the second section is for your loop
[07:39:35] <Cork> man i hope you know php...
[07:40:39] <coachz> that's what i built but you said it's wrong http://laravel.io/bin/9vq19
[07:41:10] <Cork> coachz: where did i say create a string with 'array(' ???
[07:41:24] <Yettie> how can I show data as website, while changing the old html to the new html ?
[07:41:28] <coachz> ok i have more to learn, sorry i'm so dense
[07:41:51] <coachz> i fucking hate arrays
[07:41:51] <Cork> coachz: take the code i pasted here
[07:41:58] <Cork> and reoplace "a" with  $key
[07:42:06] <Cork> and "b" with $value
[07:42:14] <Cork> and remove the c => d
[07:42:18] <Cork> and you ahve the code you want
[07:42:34] <Cork> it isn't even psudo code...
[07:43:50] <coachz> ok that worked, back to JS side now
[07:45:06] <coachz> console.log(a,b);  is now showing them
[07:46:15] <DRSK> Cork » I've successfully managed to "filter" the elements I want. Now I've stored them to var test; now I'm reselecting all elements and now I'd like to neglect those filtered, so :: $( '.item' ).not( test ).hide();
[07:46:28] <DRSK> Any reason that isn't working? It's selecting all of them anyway..
[07:46:38] <DRSK> changing filter to not results in the same thing
[07:46:52] <Cork> DRSK: it should work
[07:47:02] <Cork> unless you've cloned them or something like that
[07:47:06] <DRSK> I have!
[07:47:12] <DRSK> but I've updated the $( '.items' )
[07:47:14] <Cork> then you can't filter based on them
[07:47:18] <Cork> as they are new elements
[07:47:21] <Cork> anyway i got to go
[07:47:25] <hlvwrk> Cork. Hi2u2
[07:47:27] <DRSK> oh ok ty
[07:50:03] <coachz> Cork http://laravel.io/bin/42XnD
[07:50:29] <coachz> not sure what line 3 and 5 need to be since there are no keys with names
[07:50:54] <coachz> lines 10,11,12 are what console.log(a,b) dumps
[08:17:35] <gordi3146> hey do all the plugins available to jquery, like templates, validation etc make it similar to, and remove the need for frameworks like angularJS, or are they still totally different even with plugins?
[08:18:45] <Omar-> gordi3146 https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/jquery-angularjs-comparison-migration-walkthrough
[08:19:28] <Left_Turn> Omar-, but i mean with plugins they become more similar?
[08:20:02] <gordi3146> yes
[08:20:19] <Omar-> I cant answer that, I'm not familiar with angularjs
[08:20:45] <gordi3146> ok
[08:20:48] <Left_Turn> the cross and ticks make it seem that way
[08:21:27] <gordi3146> thanks Omar- i will read the link

[08:36:24] <mxpln> is it possible to test a whole html file instead of loading fixtures with jasmine-jquery ?
[08:37:24] <Expel> Hey. I've been struggling with an issue. I want to get the menu to slide up also and not just down, how can I do that? http://jsfiddle.net/mjGRr/
[08:38:43] <Nicolas_> Hi, I have an issue with makeing a sum of numbers. The numbers should sum up when clikcing on them not making the whole some direct as now: http://jsfiddle.net/8mnQR/226/
[08:52:32] <MajorTennis> Nicolas_, can confirm , doesnt work :)
[08:53:08] <Nicolas_> Ha :D That is true. I have tried some things but can’t get it working. Is there some good documentation that pin points what I try?
[08:54:24] <cjohnson> Nicolas_: can you describe better what your issue is?
[08:55:12] <cjohnson> you currently seem to be correctly summing all the numbers whenever you click one of them
[08:55:21] <Nicolas_> If I clikc a number it should appear on the right where the 0 now is. When I click on another number it should add up on the right. Wen I deselect a number by clicking again on it it has to  subtract.
[08:55:29] <Nicolas_> Yes correct. I can only make a full sum once.
[08:55:35] <cjohnson> line 28
[08:55:39] <cjohnson> you are selecting all of the elements
[08:55:42] <Omar-> Nicolas_ you need to delegate "click" event since classes are dynamically added
[08:55:50] <cjohnson> so of course you're getting the sum of all the elements
[08:56:00] <cjohnson> if you want a sum of only certain elements, change your selector to reflect that
[08:58:41] <Nicolas_> That is what I tried but seem to fail in.
[08:58:57] <cjohnson> what have you tried
[08:58:58] <cjohnson> for line 28
[09:00:50] <Nicolas_> Let me look it up. Just finishing some other work here :D
[09:20:51] <wfq> hi guys
[09:22:33] <wfq> I would like to show a general error when using the validate jquery plugin apart from the individual ones, of course. However this general error just will be shown if three elements don't have all a certain value
[09:22:49] <ncls> hi all
[09:23:52] <ncls> I have a XML document with many many "<node>value</node>"
[09:23:53] <wfq> I don't want to associate that potential error caused by 3 elements not having certain values to a particular value itself
[09:24:58] <ncls> how can I use jquery to find the node for a given EXACT contained value, for example "<node>34</node>" ... is there a $(xml).find(":equals[34]") ?
[09:25:22] <robertmaxrees> ncls there's a :contains() selector.  you can also use .filter().
[09:25:29] <robertmaxrees> if you care about exact, use filter.
[09:25:49] <ncls> robertmaxrees, ok thanks!
[09:26:05] <robertmaxrees> $(xml).find('node').filter(function() { return $(this).text() === '34' });
[09:26:28] <ncls> robertmaxrees, cool, thank you !
[09:26:41] <robertmaxrees> wfq you just want them to all be the same value ooor?
[09:26:43] <wfq> The only problem I have is that I don't know how to associate the custom addMethod to the form so it performs such validation without being associated to an element in particular
[09:26:52] <wfq> robertmaxrees no
[09:26:58] <robertmaxrees> wfq you have to associate it to all three elements.
[09:27:08] <wfq> I want to show the individual errors plus one special one
[09:27:32] <wfq> Ok I see
[09:38:03] <coachz> Anyone know how to loop over objects in jquery ?http://i.imgur.com/KPiEecx.png
[09:38:12] <robertmaxrees> why use jquery?
[09:38:17] <coachz> or js
[09:38:23] <robertmaxrees> easily.
[09:38:29] <robertmaxrees> for in loops.
[09:39:27] <coachz> i'm trying to get the key and value from each
[09:39:28] <stangeland> coachz, use $('.selector').each(function(idx,val){})
[09:39:41] <robertmaxrees> don't use .each() for plain objects.
[09:40:07] <igcewieling> what should it be used for?
[09:40:12] <stangeland> or do for(x in collection){...}
[09:40:13] <coachz> but i don't have a variablename in the objects
[09:40:20] <robertmaxrees> $().each() is for jquery collections.
[09:40:39] <robertmaxrees> $.each() is a generic iterator/enumerator, but not really necessary since what you need is built-in.
[09:40:43] <coachz> each obj has a key: "value"  http://i.imgur.com/KPiEecx.png
[09:41:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m2d11bur/
[09:41:13] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want, coachz
[09:41:21] <stangeland> hi, i really need to be able to layer canvas on top of an image, but when i do it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/h6y6fs61/1/ i cannot seem to nest the image properly into parenting containers and eg. center it or align it properly towards other elements. How do i make the image behave "normally" and still stack canvas elements on top of it?
[09:41:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m2d11bur/1/ with clarification, coachz
[09:42:25] <coachz> thanks robertmaxrees trying now
[09:43:38] <coachz> hmm
[09:43:46] <robertmaxrees> what?
[09:45:34] <coachz> http://i.imgur.com/miaQ0av.png
[09:45:54] <coachz> http://laravel.io/bin/W4z0z
[09:46:46] <coachz> mine is an array of objects
[09:46:53] <coachz> is that the problem ?
[09:47:49] <wfq> is it possible to trigger a specific rule only at submit time?
[09:47:59] <wfq> while the rest of rules trigger as usual?
[09:48:25] <wfq> * Sorry I am talking about validate plugin
[09:49:17] <coachz> robertmaxrees ?
[09:49:24] <robertmaxrees> one sec sorry
[09:49:49] <robertmaxrees> then use a forEach() for an iterator.
[09:49:56] <robertmaxrees> paste an example of your data pls
[09:50:25] <stangeland> why does the blue div element not contain the image? why is it collapsed behind? how do i get the image inside blue div while still being able to stack canvas on top of image? http://jsfiddle.net/h6y6fs61/2/
[09:50:28] <Ayelis> I think it was  http://i.imgur.com/KPiEecx.png
[09:50:42] <robertmaxrees> i wand the code, not a screenshot of the console ;)
[09:50:42] <coachz>  [{"10A":"CALIFORNIA DREAMING AUGUSTA"},{"1":"HOME OFFICE"},{"10":"TAHOE"},{"11":"TAVERA AT PHIPPS"},{"11A":"TAVERA AT PHIPPS OUT OF STATE"}]
[09:50:51] <robertmaxrees> great, one sec.
[09:50:59] <coachz> that's from JSON.stringify(object)
[09:51:04] <coachz> array of objects rather
[09:51:12] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[09:51:17] <robertmaxrees> if IE9 and above, this is simple.
[09:51:23] <coachz> IE9
[09:51:28] <robertmaxrees> sweet. one sec.
[09:51:30] <coachz> IE8 is dead to me
[09:51:53] <Ayelis> stangeland; if img is position:relative, the blue div will contain it. Then you can set the div to position:absolute.
[09:52:59] <Nicolas_> Woohoo I fixed it cjohnson: http://jsfiddle.net/8mnQR/228/
[09:53:40] <BillCriswell> guys
[09:54:23] <robertmaxrees> coachz http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m2d11bur/4/
[09:59:26] <Ayelis> Hey Bill
[09:59:34] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell guys guys
[09:59:45] <BillCriswell> Hi everyone.
[09:59:48] <BillCriswell> Today, I hate websites.
[09:59:55] <coachz> robertmaxrees: it's bitching about a ) hmmm
[10:00:12] <robertmaxrees> coachz where?  your code?
[10:00:14] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: on the same day they hate you!! conicidence???
[10:00:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:00:31] <coachz> myArray.forEach(function(data.locations) { });
[10:00:46] <robertmaxrees> data.locations isn't value.
[10:00:55] <robertmaxrees> that's the name of the current object.
[10:01:06] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter what you call it - just give it a var name.
[10:01:15] <coachz> id stat.locations myArray
[10:01:20] <coachz> is data.locations
[10:01:37] <coachz> ok
[10:01:52] <coachz> success !
[10:01:54] <robertmaxrees> you're iterating over myArray.  the argument you're passing to the callback is the current index.  that name has nothing to do with the internals of the object.
[10:02:03] <coachz> you rock robertmaxrees
[10:02:08] <coachz> have a cookie ;-)
[10:02:36] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees better be sharing.
[10:02:53] * coachz buys cookies for the entire channel !
[10:03:02] <robertmaxrees> holla

[10:10:40] <unicorn_abc21> anybody here who say its worth learning angularJS ?
[10:10:46] <unicorn_abc21> would say
[10:11:04] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[10:11:06] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[10:11:28] <unicorn_abc21> i want something "bigger" than backbone
[10:11:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd learn backbone, react, vue, or riot
[10:11:44] <unicorn_abc21> i only know backbone and riot
[10:11:49] <robertmaxrees> react is a neat one imo.
[10:12:01] <unicorn_abc21> why would you not learn angularjs?
[10:12:20] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:12:24] <unicorn_abc21> ook
[10:12:39] <NoiseEee> unicorn_abc21: whats the goal? employability/$$ i'd say Angular would be a good choice
[10:13:30] <unicorn_abc21> im done with the UI for a single-page app. since this is a spare time project, i would like to learn a new framework (not backone, that i know)
[10:13:40] <unicorn_abc21> backbone
[10:14:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't like the way angular does it's weirdo markup thing.
[10:14:57] <robertmaxrees> and i feel like it puts too much logic into its templating.
[10:15:06] <NoiseEee> yeah robertmaxrees i hear that
[10:15:16] <NoiseEee> lots of "people" "like" react unicorn_abc21, or ember
[10:15:18] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone know if is posible use $.browser in jquery 10?
[10:15:19] <NoiseEee> ember also has job$
[10:15:31] <unicorn_abc21> i see
[10:15:44] <robertmaxrees> abailarri $.browser was removed in 1.9
[10:15:49] <robertmaxrees> deprecated long before that.
[10:15:51] <unicorn_abc21> ah and it must have liberal licensing
[10:15:56] <unicorn_abc21> gpl is OK
[10:16:03] <robertmaxrees> unicorn_abc21 these all should.
[10:16:13] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, in 1.8 is possible to use?
[10:16:14] <unicorn_abc21> i thought so!
[10:16:21] <abailarri> or there one substitute?
[10:16:29] <robertmaxrees> abailarri yes, but it's deprecated.  browser detection is a bad idea.
[10:16:53] <unicorn_abc21> whats the biggest advantage of using ember compared to backbone?
[10:17:45] <robertmaxrees> tons of articles comparing all of them.
[10:18:57] <unicorn_abc21> yeha i know that there is no objective answer, probably. i'm interested in personal opinions.
[10:19:03] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, I have a client that has this in the web, and if I want to upgrade the jquery , then, what can I do?
[10:19:40] <robertmaxrees> abailarri 2 options - use jquery migrate, or fix your code.
[10:19:51] <robertmaxrees> what are you using browser detection for?
[10:20:06] <NoiseEee> unicorn_abc21: ember is pretty opinionated with how you should architect your app/etc
[10:20:11] <stangeland> why is the load handler never invoked? http://jsfiddle.net/h6y6fs61/7/
[10:20:20] <robertmaxrees> abailarri this is a very good guide http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[10:20:32] <NoiseEee> unicorn_abc21: there are websites that can explain some diffs, but the mvvc world is always changing
[10:21:10] <robertmaxrees> stangeland because you have to bind the handler after the tag exists, but before the image loads.
[10:21:35] <unicorn_abc21> Is there a js template engine that does not completely redraw the view when the model changes? (Ignoring the fact that probably any engine could be tweaked to behave so).
[10:21:43] <robertmaxrees> react does that.
[10:21:57] <robertmaxrees> it does diffing in a virtual dom and only updates what's necessary.
[10:22:05] <unicorn_abc21> That sounds nice, thanks.
[10:22:21] <robertmaxrees> be aware that react is an FRP framework.
[10:22:30] <NoiseEee> i've held off on going with an mvvc framework forever
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> me too.  i don't like MVC in JS
[10:22:44] <NoiseEee> because i know whatever one i choose will be completely different / better ones will exist a year from now
[10:23:19] <NoiseEee> a tradeoff between learning curve and then speed of developing versus just devving in the style i have now
[10:23:27] <happyp> http://surrealpixel.com/x1 i am trying to implement tooltips into my sidebar icons using http://www.tippedjs.com/. does anyone know what i would need to put into my markup to make them show up? their documentation isn't that great on it
[10:23:34] <NoiseEee> but i am planning on learning angular in the next little bit, mostly for $$$ and future employability
[10:23:52] <robertmaxrees> beware that the next version of angular is apparently going to be fundamentally different.
[10:24:08] <NoiseEee> yeah lol of course it is
[10:24:27] <NoiseEee> same with ember, shit just changes so fast
[10:25:07] <NoiseEee> `shrug
[10:25:07] <b-ot> NoiseEee: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> happyp http://www.tippedjs.com/documentation
[10:25:26] <robertmaxrees> you have to init in your JS
[10:26:01] <happyp> yeah i looked at the documentation and was a bit confused in the installation process. i linked everything inside my head but i wasn't sure what i needed to put in the actual markup to get it to show up
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> happyp the docs explain it.
[10:26:47] <robertmaxrees> happyp http://www.tippedjs.com/documentation#usage_creating_tooltips
[10:27:11] <happyp> yeah that is the part i am confused about... does that go in a javascript file?
[10:27:14] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:27:17] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[10:27:31] <robertmaxrees> anything that should have a tooltip needs a shared class.
[10:27:34] <_wired> hey guys, quick question. if say i wanna intercept <a> links to call a function first, but thereafter still proceed to the original action (i.e, another page) after the function completes… does that just mean that i should sequentially run the function followed by return true?
[10:27:42] <robertmaxrees> then you pop in the JS and you're good to go.
[10:28:13] <robertmaxrees> _wired you have to preventdefault, capture the href, run your logic, then to window.location.href = theUrl;
[10:28:25] <_wired> ah i see
[10:28:33] <_wired> got it thanks :P no wonder it was acting wonky sometimes
[10:28:35] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you have no guarantee that your logic will run before the page goes elsewhere
[10:28:46] <_wired> sometimes it fires sometimes it doesnt lol
[10:29:03] <robertmaxrees> don't return true/false out of event handlers btw.  explicitly cancel events or don't.
[10:30:24] <_wired> robertmaxrees: got it. im rusty at this hahaha
[10:30:31] <_wired> thanks again!
[10:31:06] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:55:53] <Vesper> Hey guys. I'm kinda stuck here
[10:55:57] <robertmaxrees> 'sup
[10:56:00] <Vesper> $("#dropdown_equipmentquantity").prop("readonly", true);
[10:56:07] <Vesper> Anyone have a clue why this isn't working?
[10:56:23] <robertmaxrees> share a fiddle?
[10:56:44] <Vesper> Sure. 1 sec
[10:58:02] <Vesper> http://jsfiddle.net/fat4zxje/
[10:58:11] <Vesper> It uses a lil bit of PHP, so that's broken in the fiddle
[10:58:16] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:58:18] <robertmaxrees> the actual markup.
[10:59:20] <Vesper> What's up with the markup?
[10:59:31] <robertmaxrees> instead of the php
[11:00:14] <Vesper> That's at the top lol. I've updated it so the JS is in the JS box now
[11:00:26] <Vesper> I just have all my JQuery stuff in a script tag on the HTML page
[11:00:26] <robertmaxrees> right - don't want the php at all.
[11:00:32] <robertmaxrees> anyway, dropdowns are already readonly.
[11:00:41] <robertmaxrees> i think you want disabled.
[11:00:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fat4zxje/2/
[11:01:08] <Vesper> Aha. Lemme add that quick and see if it works fine
[11:02:01] <Vesper> Awesome. Works great thanks!
[11:02:18] <robertmaxrees> in the future, don't put php in the markup area in fiddle.
[11:02:25] <robertmaxrees> put the rendered html instead :)
[11:03:16] <happyp> http://surrealpixel.com/x1 any idea how i can make my tooltip for Dashboard show to the right?
[11:03:30] <happyp> im using tippedjs
[11:03:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the tooltips at all, happyp
[11:04:03] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[11:04:16] <happyp> there is CSS shown on their example to make it show to the right
[11:04:22] <happyp> but im not sure how to accomplish it
[11:04:29] <robertmaxrees> link to where you see that.
[11:04:38] <Vesper> float: right or something like that maybe?
[11:04:53] <happyp> i had to download tripped to see it
[11:04:56] <happyp> its in the /example/ folder
[11:05:04] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:05:06] <happyp> sec
[11:05:55] <robertmaxrees> www.tippedjs.com/documentation#usage_options
[11:05:57] <robertmaxrees> this explains it.
[11:06:03] <robertmaxrees> when you init, pass that ptions object.
[11:08:29] <robertmaxrees> Tipped.create('#dashboard', 'Dashboard', {position: 'right'}); i'm guessing
[11:08:38] <happyp> thanks man!
[11:08:39] <happyp> that worked
[11:09:18] <robertmaxrees> rtfm ;)
[11:34:54] <igcewieling> I think the answer is "no", but I wanted to check here first.  Without using frames or iframes is there any way to only triger the scroll event when specific elements scroll without binding it to the $(window) object and ignoring scroll events I don't care about?
[11:35:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:35:24] <robertmaxrees> "specific elements scroll"?  like a div with overflow: scroll;?
[11:35:42] <igcewieling>  $(window).on('scroll', function() {
[11:35:42] <igcewieling>         $('.sticky').each (function () { }
[11:35:53] <igcewieling> in this case the .sticky elements
[11:36:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:36:09] <robertmaxrees> so when the window scrolls, do something to some elements?
[11:36:26] <gnarf> yeah - i agree with the "huh" --- the elements don't scroll (unless they have overflow scroll/auto
[11:36:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[11:37:03] <robertmaxrees> i should make a thing that visually explains events and event bindings.
[11:37:06] <igcewieling> here is the full function I created.
[11:37:11] <gnarf> in which case they fire their own scroll events if you scroll inside that element, you should be able to catch a scroll event on the thing that has overflow: scroll/auto
[11:37:11] <igcewieling> http://jsfiddle.net/br1s1o56/
[11:37:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of logic in the scroll handler.
[11:38:13] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: *nod* that is my concern.  any suggestions?
[11:38:33] <gnarf> igcewieling: debounce
[11:38:40] <igcewieling> ??
[11:38:52] <gnarf> `g jquery debounce
[11:38:54] <b-ot> gnarf: Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce » Examples » Debounce → http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[11:38:57] <robertmaxrees> debounce and move selectors/calculations out of the handler if possible.
[11:39:26] <gnarf> basically, your scroll event does a clearTimeout(scrollhandle); scrollHandle = setTimeout(doScrollCalcs, 100);
[11:39:44] <gnarf> so that way it only fires one event, 100ms after the "last scroll" event
[11:39:54] <gnarf> and that the scroll event itself is a super quick execution
[11:40:01] <gnarf> but really
[11:40:07] <gnarf> why do you need to do this calculation?
[11:40:22] <gnarf> tab.offset().top seems like it wouldn't change?
[11:41:19] <igcewieling> gnarf: it doesn't but making it a global variable seemed ugly.
[11:41:45] <robertmaxrees> then wrap everything in an IIFE>
[11:41:50] <gnarf> global is pretty ugly, but surely you have an outer clousure you could store it in
[11:42:21] <igcewieling> I don't know enough to do that and expect to succeed without a lot of time invested.
[11:42:31] <gnarf> but like from the code i'm reading your basically converting your headers to fixed position when yu scroll past them?
[11:43:52] <igcewieling> gnarf: I created cloned headers for each .sticky when the page loads which are fixed position so instead of repositioning the header or changing the header from static to something else and getting a flicker when scrolling it is nice and smooth.
[11:44:26] <gnarf> sure - but why do you need the                 header_fixed.css('top', tab.offset().top - 12); part
[11:44:32] <gnarf> can you define that in a css selector?
[11:44:37] <jcrawford> Hello everyone.  I am using Jquery Mobile for some UI on a project and we have multiple page forms that are using ajax.  I have all of the javascript figured out and it is working thus far.  However on page one of the process we have two file inputs for uploading images.  Can someone direct me to something to read to understand how I can grab these values and then use them on the final page to post to the server with the rest of the form data?
[11:45:09] <igcewieling> gnarf: you mean like give it an ID or something?
[11:45:38] <gnarf> is the tab also fixed?
[11:46:01] <igcewieling> the tab is not fixed
[11:46:22] <gnarf> igcewieling: i mean like - couldn't it just be .sticky_header_fixed { top: 12px; }
[11:46:40] <igcewieling> gnarf: each tab may have a different top margin
[11:47:23] <gnarf> but once you scroll past it, offset().top is going to be really far down
[11:47:32] <gnarf> hence your -12 prolly
[11:47:52] <gnarf> once you scroll past it you want it to "stick" in roughly the same position every time ?
[11:48:16] <igcewieling> standby
[11:50:37] <igcewieling> offset().top does not change as the page scrolls.
[11:50:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:50:54] <igcewieling> I thought it should, but it doesn't.
[11:51:07] <gnarf> you could do something more like: var scrollTop = $(window).scrollTop(); $('.sticky').each(function() { var el = $(this); var header=el.children('.sticky_header').first(); var offset = header.offset(); el.toggleClass('above-the-fold-stuck', scrollTop > offset.top && scrollTop < offset.top + box.height()); });
[11:51:10] <igcewieling> scrolltop changes
[11:51:12] <gnarf> then you can just css it
[11:51:20] <t0astt> I have a link that when clicked changes from "Edit" to "Save". Clicking the link when it is "Edit" changes cells in a table to text fields. When clicking the link when it is "Save", it takes the text from those text fields and uses AJAX to push it to the database. What would be the most efficient way to change the Edit text to Save and then handle clicks on the "Save" button? I have this right now: http://pastebin.com/WE715nct
[11:51:29] <igcewieling> exactly what do you mean by "css it"
[11:51:39] <gnarf> .sticky_header_fixed { display: none; position: fixed; top: 15px; width: 100px; }
[11:51:53] <gnarf> .above-the-fold-stuck .sticky_header_fixed { display: block; }
[11:52:05] <igcewieling> but I don't want it 15 px from the top.
[11:52:24] <gnarf> wherever you want it
[11:52:39] <gnarf> probably the top of the window because you scrolled past it
[11:52:42] <robertmaxrees> t0astt .text() on the node or hide/show things that you want.
[11:53:14] <robertmaxrees> t0astt i'd check out .closest() instead of .parents() btw.
[11:53:19] <igcewieling> I could make them different classes I guess, one class for tabs which start at 66px from the top, one class for tabs starting 33px from the top, etc.
[11:53:51] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: But then if I keep the class of that Edit the same, then my original onClick will still be picking up clicks on that Save button
[11:54:09] <robertmaxrees> you can swap out the class on it then.
[11:54:22] <robertmaxrees> also - pageEditButton.on('click', function(e) { don't do this.
[11:54:36] <robertmaxrees> you already have that handler bound.
[11:54:49] <robertmaxrees> doing bindings in a binding is very yo dawg.
[11:55:03] <gnarf> t0astt: why not have an edit and a save button and toggle the display/visibility based on a parent's ".editing" selector
[11:55:15] <gnarf> .editing .edit { display: none; }
[11:55:24] <t0astt> hah, alright. I'm more of a back end guy, so I usually just touch jQuery when I need it
[11:55:25] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: something like this?   .sticky_header_fixed_66 { display: none; position: fixed; top: 66px; width: 100px; }  .sticky_header_fixed_90 { display: none; position: fixed; top: 90px; width: 100px; }   .sticky_header_fixed_15 { display: none; position: fixed; top: 15px; width: 100px; }
[11:55:26] <gnarf> .editing .save { display: block; }
[11:55:34] <gnarf> .save { display: none; }
[11:55:39] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling i was talking to t0astt, sorry.
[11:56:01] <gnarf> igcewieling: easier to have .sticky_header_fixed always the same
[11:56:06] <gnarf> but the container class can matter
[11:56:08] <igcewieling> t0astt: same here, I only use Javascript because PHP won't run in a browser.
[11:56:22] <gnarf> igcewieling: and thank god it doesnt ;)
[11:56:29] <robertmaxrees> yesss
[11:56:33] <t0astt> heh
[11:56:37] <gnarf> igcewieling: so like, CSS is "cascading" for a reason
[11:56:45] <igcewieling> gnarf: I still don't understand how we make different headers appear at different places depending on which tab it is located in.
[11:56:45] <gnarf> if you just have .sticky_header_fixed { display: none; position: fixed; top: 15px; width: 100px; }
[11:57:01] <gnarf> and the "parent" of that div has a class like "tab_66"
[11:57:04] <gnarf> then you can have a
[11:57:14] <gnarf> .tab_66 .stick_header_fixed { top: 66px; }
[11:57:29] <gnarf> and now the code doesn't need to know about like 10 classes and hunt around
[11:57:44] <gnarf> it can just use .sticky_header_fixed and rely on the "tab" class to tell it how high it needs to stick
[11:57:49] <robertmaxrees> and you're letting your CSS do its job.
[11:58:06] <igcewieling> I'll review this chat log and try and figure out what you mean.
[11:58:22] <igcewieling> thanks for trying to help, I just don't know enough for it to do a lot of good.
[11:59:10] <gnarf> igcewieling: also remember elements can have multiple classes
[11:59:12] <gnarf> so you can do like
[11:59:17] <gnarf> <div class="tab tab_66">
[12:03:59] <igcewieling> too me 4 days to come up with that code
[12:04:49] <igcewieling> I'll go through each tab, find the top margin and put it in a class for each different position
[12:04:57] <cxm> hi
[12:05:05] <cxm> i have a question
[12:05:09] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[12:05:19] <cxm> should jquery be called at the clsoing body tag or does it not matter?
[12:05:27] <igcewieling> or I'll leave it as it is and put it on the "for when I know more" list.
[12:05:49] <robertmaxrees> totally depends, cxm.  generally you should put your assets before </body>, but there are cases to be made for leaving 'em in the <head>
[12:06:25] <cxm> well that's the problem. my jquery is at the /body portion but revolution slider for some reason will only work if it is in the head section
[12:06:52] <robertmaxrees> what's the error you're getting?
[12:09:43] <cxm> why would something only work if it is in the header vs in the body
[12:09:52] <cxm> meaning shouldn't the dom load first.
[12:12:02] <cxm> anyone here?
[12:12:11] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't matter.
[12:12:17] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any console errors?
[12:12:53] <cxm> that's a good point... yet
[12:12:54] <cxm> yes
[12:13:08] <robertmaxrees> and that is?
[12:15:11] <cxm>  jquery.themepunch.revolution.min.js:9 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined aaa:384 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined http://wgrservice.com/virginia/williamsburg/aaa# Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CACHE_MISS
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> cxm you should have jquery before the revolution slider regardless of where you put it.
[12:15:44] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you're not loading multiple copies of jquery as well.
[12:16:08] <cxm> ahhhh i see what you're saying... I need to move the jqeury from revolution down
[12:16:30] <robertmaxrees> "jquery from revolution down"?
[12:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you should only have one copy of jquery on the page.
[12:19:07] <cxm> no i have the actual jquery files form the slider
[12:19:37] <cxm> ok so the errors are removed.. now there is just one.. which says my jquery is not defined but it is... perhaps the initiator has to be below too?
[12:19:52] <robertmaxrees> yes.  all code that relies on jquery needs to be below the jquery include.
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> well, all javascript that relies on it.
[12:20:14] <jcrawford> Hello everyone.  I am using Jquery Mobile for some UI on a project and we have multiple page forms that are using ajax.  I have all of the javascript figured out and it is working thus far.  However on page one of the process we have two file inputs for uploading images.  Can someone direct me to something to read to understand how I can grab these values and then use them on the final page to post to the server with the rest of the form data?
[12:21:44] <cxm> ok bam that worked... but why is the initiator a problem?  hmmmm
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> because everything else needs to exist first.
[12:22:28] <cxm> well the initiator specifically has this code to make sure that it doesn't' fire until everything loads first
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> you mean the document ready?
[12:22:48] <robertmaxrees> becuase that's not what that means.
[12:23:10] <robertmaxrees> document ready means the page has said it's fired the ready event, which isn't tied to anything finishing loading.
[12:23:25] <robertmaxrees> well, as far as external assets are concerned.
[12:24:05] <robertmaxrees> also, if it's using the jquery document ready, it still needs jquery available first to use it :)
[12:24:49] <cxm> jQuery(document).ready(function()
[12:25:01] <cxm> doesn't that mean it won't fire until everything is loaded?
[12:25:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:25:28] <robertmaxrees> that means the page is "ready", which is a distinct concept.  basically it means all the markup is ready to go.
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> and since you're calling jQuery for that, you need jquery first anyway.
[12:36:52] <cryptopsy> in jquerui how do i put an accordion in an accordion?
[12:37:22] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy http://stackoverflow.com/a/8686403/923919
[12:39:40] <cryptopsy> thanks
[12:40:09] <javalover> i don't understand how noConflict works
[12:40:23] <javalover> and i'm trying really really really hard to use it properly
[12:40:32] <javalover> but I feel like i'm not coding..i'm just guessing
[12:41:01] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need to know?
[12:41:14] <javalover> I want to load an old version of jquery & then load it's script....
[12:41:26] <javalover> but everytime I try to do this..it fails
[12:41:46] <robertmaxrees> O.o why are you loading multiple versions in the first place?
[12:41:58] <javalover> the old script requires the old jquery
[12:42:09] <robertmaxrees> why not update everything to use a newer version?
[12:42:10] <javalover> it uses $.safari & stuff
[12:42:19] <javalover> cuz i didn't write the plugin
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> or use the migrate plugin until you can update/replace the plugin
[12:42:42] <javalover> hows that work?
[12:43:04] <robertmaxrees> include jquery. include migrate.  include your plugin.
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> done.
[12:43:15] <javalover> really?
[12:43:16] <javalover> wtf
[12:45:53] <javalover> jQuery is not compatible with Quirks Mode
[12:46:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:47:06] <robertmaxrees> why are you in quirks mode?
[12:47:13] <javalover> i have no idea
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> you have a doctype, right?
[12:47:28] <javalover> ummm
[12:47:31] <javalover> idk i'm loading from php
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> open your page source.
[12:47:46] <robertmaxrees> make sure there's a doctype.
[12:47:54] <javalover> do i just put it at the top?
[12:48:08] <javalover> lend me an example line for that...
[12:48:09] <robertmaxrees> it should be the very first thing in the page.
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> <!doctype html>
[12:48:23] <javalover> oh i just had <html>
[12:48:52] <Ayelis> Should have both.
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> that's implied.
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> need a doctype, html, head, and body.
[12:50:38] <javalover>  JQMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated
[12:50:42] <javalover> now it just says that...
[12:51:00] <robertmaxrees> javalover right.  migrate will fill it in for you until you can upgrade that plugin.
[12:51:02] <robertmaxrees> or replace it.
[12:51:10] <javalover> I also have this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'safari' of undefined
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:51:49] <robertmaxrees> everything needs to come after migrate.
[12:51:54] <robertmaxrees> the only thing that comes before is jquery.
[12:51:55] <javalover> none of this happens if i just use jquery 1.4
[12:52:17] <javalover> i mean...
[12:52:24] <javalover> the problem is i have a template loader
[12:52:34] <javalover> so it's one page and this page is wrapped inside it
[12:53:11] <robertmaxrees> the javascript has no knowledge of any of that.
[12:53:20] <robertmaxrees> it just sees the markup.
[12:54:57] <javalover>  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'safari' of undefined
[12:55:12] <javalover> and i basically removed everything
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> the undefined is becuase the jquery object doesn't exist.
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> do you still have noconflict turned on?
[12:55:36] <javalover> nope
[12:56:20] <robertmaxrees> then something is trying to run before jquery exists.
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> because that error means it can't find $
[12:56:44] <javalover> hmmm
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> everything is loading in the correct order, right?
[12:57:16] <javalover> wait
[12:57:20] <javalover> maybe in original pageI have it
[12:57:39] <javalover> nope don't have in homepage
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and type console.log($.fn.jquery); - what does this do?
[12:58:12] <javalover> 1.11.0
[12:58:13] <javalover> and Undefined
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting "and Undefined" from/
[12:58:31] <javalover> maybe if i clear cache
[12:58:32] <javalover> lets see
[12:59:19] <javalover> idk i get 2 lines though
[12:59:21] <javalover> and one is undefined
[12:59:29] <robertmaxrees> then something is very broken.
[12:59:30] <cryptopsy> bye for now
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> you should only get one.
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:00:50] <fartface> In jQuery, I'm able to parse XML by using $.find('element'), but is there a way to change an elements name while retaining its children and attributes?
[13:00:55] <fartface> Hopefully that question made sense
[13:01:34] <javalover> ok
[13:01:37] <javalover> so this is what i discovered
[13:01:48] <javalover> probably just a giant mistake on my part but
[13:01:59] <javalover> <!--     i take it, this doesn't remove javascript
[13:02:09] <javalover> it comments html but not javascript..
[13:02:31] <javalover> cuz i deleted stuff I had commented out...and then it worked
[13:03:04] <javalover> this is a problem though I want to leave the old scripts there cuz i need them to harmonize
[13:04:35] <melchior> I'm stumped as to how to keep parallax effects from looking really choppy in Chrome. I really stripped down my functions to make them as fast as I could, but while it's smooth in Safari, it's still choppy in Chrome http://pastebin.com/XtNVbwbJ
[13:04:37] <fartface> Does this (http://pastebin.com/An8hZHZY) question make sense to anyone?
[13:04:38] <Ayelis> Yeah, HTML, but not javascript. In fact, it's common practice to hide javascript inside of HTML comment blocks, since some old browsers used to show it.
[13:05:17] <javalover> so what should I do then?
[13:05:28] <javalover> when testing stuff out....how to comment out imported javascript?
[13:05:31] <snover> it’s not common practice. “old browsers” means netscape 1.
[13:05:31] <Ayelis> Do //single line
[13:05:37] <javalover> but the line is lke
[13:05:40] <Ayelis> or /* multi-line */
[13:05:51] <javalover> <script type = "text/javascript" src = "myfile.js"></script>
[13:06:09] <javalover> how do you comment that?
[13:06:10] <melchior> Has anyone else had problems with parallax scrolling looking super choppy in Chrome?
[13:06:11] <Ayelis> Oh, well. In that case, do <!-- script> </script --> ;)
[13:06:25] <javalover> oh inside it?
[13:06:27] <javalover> so like
[13:06:35] <Ayelis> Yeah. That will read as a comment instead of a script tag
[13:06:40] <javalover> <!-- script type = "text/javascript"></script -->
[13:06:43] <Ayelis> Yep
[13:06:46] <javalover> ohhhh
[13:06:47] <javalover> ok
[13:06:55] <javalover> notepad++ doesn't seem to care good to know
[13:07:41] <javalover> i think I just had a file that was causing trouble
[13:07:53] <javalover> as ever since removing that everything is fine, it was a different version of the plugin i wanted
[13:08:03] * Ayelis still codes for Netscape 1 compliance. xD
[13:08:41] <Ayelis> I also type </table>, just to make sure they show up. WHAT NOW D:
[13:09:39] <Ayelis> People are all like "I can open a new <td> without ending the last one!" Psh, no you can't. You don't know Netscape!
[13:10:07] <javalover> ok frustration is gone
[13:10:19] <javalover> lol @Ayelis
[13:10:25] <javalover> srry twitch chat
[13:10:46] <Ayelis> I'm kidding. I only work with DIVs these days. What's a table? LOL
[13:10:56] <javalover> i format using table layouts...
[13:10:59] <javalover> but i use divs
[13:11:14] <Ayelis> Flexbox is where it's AT!
[13:11:25] <javalover> i'd like to thank you guys for helping me
[13:11:35] <javalover> i was  having a nervous breakdown and you calmed me down and now it owrks
[13:11:37] <javalover> works*
[13:12:20] <fas3r> hello,
[13:12:24] <javalover> i'm still getting the second line of undefined though... when typing this:  console.log($.fn.jquery);
[13:12:35] <javalover> but my site loads...odd
[13:13:48] <melchior> I'm stumped as to how to keep parallax effects from looking really choppy in Chrome. I really stripped down my functions to make them as fast as I could, but while it's smooth in Safari, it's still choppy in Chrome http://pastebin.com/XtNVbwbJ
[13:15:29] <Ayelis> javalover, type console.log($().jquery);
[13:15:35] <fas3r> I'm sending the content of my form using "serialize", do you know if it's possible to add an element to this table ? or I have to add a hidden input ?
[13:15:58] <javalover> same result
[13:16:08] <fas3r> javalover: I know :)
[13:16:16] <fas3r> but just wondering if it's possible :D
[13:16:34] <javalover> no not you fas3r
[13:16:39] <javalover> Ayelis same result
[13:16:41] <fas3r> javalover: haha oK :D
[13:16:57] <javalover> i get 2 lines, one undefined the other my jquery version
[13:17:35] <notchris> How can I check if a script is being deffered correctly?
[13:19:25] <javalover> idk i'm just happy my code is working
[13:19:30] <javalover> this migrate stuff is a blast
[13:19:52] <Ayelis> melchior; Just use two marquee tags running at different scroll speeds. ;)
[13:20:13] <Ayelis> (Netscape 1 answers FTW!)
[13:20:33] <melchior> Ayelis: Thank you soooo much, I'm just gonna get in my time machine
[13:20:35] <Ayelis> JK I don't work here, what do you want from me!
[13:23:55] <Ayelis> Hmm... I see you're iterating i++ instead of a smaller value such as i=i+0.1... Maybe that will help? (Probably not.)
[13:24:28] <Ayelis> I tried getting the script running in a fiddle, but it wouldn't work for me.
[13:26:03] <robertmaxrees> javalover did you figure it out?
[13:26:08] <Ayelis> Oh, offsets, yeah, that wouldn't work at all. What am I thinking. If anything you'd change speed.
[13:26:09] <javalover> i mean the page loads
[13:26:16] <javalover> so although this is an issue i don't care
[13:26:31] <javalover> i'm just happy the damn thing loads
[13:31:24] <Ayelis> And you're trying to get the jquery version but it keeps telling you undefined? Maybe there is no version. Is jQ included in your project? ;p
[13:32:02] <Ayelis> Also, before or after the console.log query?
[13:40:31] <alexclark> has anyone here used the stickem plugin?
[13:45:08] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ alexclark
[13:45:08] <b-ot> alexclark: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:45:32] <hlvwrk> gah
[13:45:35] <hlvwrk> I love olives.
[13:45:35] <hlvwrk> :)
[13:45:54] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: meh, ill pass then
[13:46:06] <robertmaxrees> alexclark hrm?  do you need help oooor...?
[13:46:36] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: from a human maybe
[13:46:43] <robertmaxrees> we're human.
[13:46:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:47:11] <hlvwrk> i'm human.
[13:47:22] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees is only half human.
[13:48:05] <Ayelis> Which half?
[13:48:22] <hlvwrk> ;)
[13:50:51] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: lol away the awkwardness
[13:51:17] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:52:21] <Ayelis> Melchior, there are extensions to get Chrome to scroll smoothly. "SmoothScroll" works pretty well. Don't even have to restart the browser.
[13:58:34] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: I appologize, actually. You don't deserve that. It's just not very much fun asking for help from someone that issues bot commands at you.
[13:59:29] <robertmaxrees> we have that because it's so common for people to ask that.
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> i can see how it might be offputting, but oftentimes we can just help :)
[14:01:05] <alexclark> but to that point, im not going bother asking a question if im pretty sure no one can help me
[14:01:19] <Ayelis> Looks like I scared off Melchior with my horrible coding practices. A shame. I just found GSGD's jQuery easing plugin too.
[14:01:30] <alexclark> asking takes time and effort more than typing a question
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> alexclark more often than not we can help is what i'm saying.
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:02:20] <alexclark> it can actually be the one of the most difficult parts of learning for newer developers
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> asking can be?
[14:03:09] <alexclark> yes
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:03:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd take a shot.
[14:03:45] <alexclark> problem isolation is almost impossible for someone who is new
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> but that's me - haven't really had somebody respons like this before haha
[14:04:23] <alexclark> yay im a snowflake!
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd give it a shot even if you can't isolate.
[14:05:03] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: anyways have you ever used stickem?
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:05:20] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
[14:05:24] <robertmaxrees> http://davist11.github.io/jQuery-Stickem/
[14:05:27] <robertmaxrees> looks pretty basic though.
[14:19:01] <alexclark> ok heres my question
[14:19:38] <alexclark> if i have a percentage height, on what event handler would i have to wrap a function that queries that to get a number?
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> changes in height?
[14:19:58] <alexclark> i tried document.ready and window.load
[14:20:12] <robertmaxrees> there's a window resize event that you can bind to, but i'm not sure what you mean by "percentage height"
[14:20:25] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: height:50%;
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> okay - so are you looking for cases when the window is resized?
[14:21:54] <alexclark> nope, initial load
[14:22:04] <stangeland> hi, in my $(function(){}) function i query an image for width and height but it returns 0, so i suppose its because it somehow has not loaded yet. how do i obtain the width of the image then?
[14:22:06] <alexclark> wait shit, its not a load issue
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> stangeland use a window load instead.
[14:22:49] <robertmaxrees> $(window).load(function() {});
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> stangeland document ready fires before images load.
[14:24:13] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, mmm ok, inside  $(window).load(function() { it also returns 0
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:24:58] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, is it because the image is not shown on page load? its hidden behind a tab control
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> depending on how you're hiding it, yeah that's important.
[14:25:34] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, i am relying on bootstrap for hiding it - im actually not sure how it does it
[14:25:35] <igcewieling> stangeland: As I understand it elements with display:none have no dimensions or position
[14:25:51] <robertmaxrees> that'd cause your headaches then.
[14:25:58] <stangeland> igcewieling, right - that might be it then
[14:26:02] <stangeland> yeah
[14:26:23] <igcewieling> you can position it way off the the left of the screen so it will be "displayed" but not seen.  Then it will have dimensions
[14:26:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a hack though.
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> and i wouldn';t trust it.
[14:26:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you reading the image size?
[14:27:13] <igcewieling> everything in a browser is a hack.  an alternative might be to place the element behind another element (z-index), but I've not tried that.
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[14:27:25] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> understanding the why is is important
[14:27:58] <stangeland> right ok - i need the size because i am placing multiple canvas on top which needs to have same dimensions
[14:28:06] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: For a PHP person, everything in the browser is a hack.  If a hack isn't needed we'd to it in PHP on the server.
[14:28:17] <robertmaxrees> i still disagree.
[14:28:21] <stangeland> hmmm maybe i can just set them to have height and width 100% instead
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> i do both front AND backend work in a variety of languages and couldn't disagree more with you :)
[14:29:03] <robertmaxrees> stangeland give that a shot.  otherwise you'll need another way to communicate height/width
[14:29:06] <igcewieling> we can disagree
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> absolutely :)
[14:33:10] <robertmaxrees> stangeland did you figure it out?
[14:35:02] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, yeah, that - solved it differently
[14:35:08] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:35:34] <stangeland> thx
[14:52:14] <robertmaxrees> neeeeeeeeeet spliiit
[15:18:48] <Duvdevan> <Duvdevan>
[15:38:11] <MEGAGHZ_> anyone?!
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:38:52] <robertmaxrees> MEGAGHZ we were in the middle of a massive netsplit storm.
[15:38:56] <robertmaxrees> have a question?
[15:39:12] <MEGAGHZ> hello
[15:39:17] <MEGAGHZ> omg, yes thats why to many splits
[15:39:18] <MEGAGHZ> BOTS ARE COMING!
[15:39:22] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:39:25] <robertmaxrees> bad firewall config.
[15:40:01] <MEGAGHZ> yes - was working on some simple jquery animations, but for example, using fadeIn.
[15:40:19] <MEGAGHZ> the problem is that I have to rule the elements with display:none; to make it work
[15:40:51] <MEGAGHZ> but the other surronding elements act weird, cos the animated element is not there, and then it appear an all moves
[15:41:42] <MEGAGHZ> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9d3f4d67041b7de8e693
[15:42:43] <MEGAGHZ> maybe I have to use other css rule
[15:42:56] <MEGAGHZ> but the jquery is not working without display:none;
[15:48:21] <MEGAGHZ> robertmaxrees: ping!
[15:48:44] <robertmaxrees> pong
[15:48:48] <MEGAGHZ> ;)
[15:48:51] <robertmaxrees> dunno how you want me to help when i can't see the issue.
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle or somethin'?
[15:49:08] <MEGAGHZ> saw the gist?
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> yep - no clue what your markup looks like, what it's doing, how things are broken...
[15:49:30] <zzzz9> hey guys, is there a Mustache/Handlebars specific channel or can I ask questions here regarding that?
[15:50:42] <robertmaxrees> zzzz9 you can try asking but you might not have much luck.
[15:51:00] <robertmaxrees> a lack of a dedicated channel doesn't mean that this is necessarily the right place though ;)
[15:51:17] <MEGAGHZ> robertmaxrees: just a two 3 divs, one is logo, other is nav, other below is slider... i want the slider stay in place even when the animation is not finished, cus otherwise the slider moves up and then moves down when the navbar appear (after animation)
[15:51:33] <MEGAGHZ> zzzz9: maybe javascript or fontend
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> MEGAGHZ sounds like you want to animate a child of the container.
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> and then hide/show the container maybe?
[15:52:25] <MEGAGHZ> yes
[15:52:50] <MEGAGHZ> mmm but i want the slider to appear and then the animation
[15:52:57] <MEGAGHZ> let me see if i can do a quick jsfiddle
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> you can do callbacks and stuff.
[15:55:30] <zzzz9> robertmaxrees that's why I asked ;)
[15:56:43] <zzzz9> I just have an if statement .... if ($('asdf').val() === 'asdf') ... and would like to impliment that into mustache
[15:56:46] <MEGAGHZ> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/kostx71f/
[15:57:23] <MEGAGHZ> the slider appear within the flow, but when the nav appear, it moves
[15:57:47] <robertmaxrees> so you want the "slider" to stay in one place the entire time?
[15:57:53] <MEGAGHZ> yeah
[15:58:08] <MEGAGHZ> in the same place as it does when the animation finish
[15:58:19] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, wrap the entire header dealio in a div, give it a height, and go from there.
[15:58:23] <MEGAGHZ> white room for the nav to appear
[15:58:42] <MEGAGHZ> dealio?
[15:58:43] <MEGAGHZ> sorry
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> wrap the entire header in a div.
[15:58:59] <robertmaxrees> give that div a set height.
[15:59:00] <MEGAGHZ> yes
[15:59:06] <MEGAGHZ> ahh
[15:59:07] <MEGAGHZ> ok
[15:59:10] <MEGAGHZ> let me try
[16:00:38] <MEGAGHZ> thats work, thanks
[16:00:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:12:30] <acidjazz> hi everyone
[16:13:07] <acidjazz> i have a function that when its run, binds to keydown and click, then inside that function is a function that unbinds those.. is htis possible?
[16:13:28] <robertmaxrees> possible but not a good idea.
[16:13:55] <acidjazz> whats the best way to clean up once this function is done?
[16:14:30] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing the bind and unbinding in the first place?
[16:14:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're working around something.
[16:14:56] <acidjazz> its a prompt function that pops open a prompt modal
[16:15:06] <acidjazz> while the modals open you can interact by clicking a button or hittin genter/escape
[16:15:18] <acidjazz> once you do that i run the prompts callback and tell you what the user did
[16:15:34] <robertmaxrees> bind delegated listeners and rely on those instead.
[16:15:48] <acidjazz> delegated...
[16:15:52] <acidjazz> as in using like.. .on ?
[16:16:15] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[16:16:40] <acidjazz> but wont those possibly fire wether or not the promtp is open?
[16:16:46] <acidjazz> i just want them listening when teh prompt is up
[16:16:47] <robertmaxrees> the events fire anyway.
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> check to see if the prompt is open in that handler.
[16:17:17] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/63104b3a1a1519c6ce30#file-prompt-js-L62
[16:17:52] <acidjazz> and these .on's can run in the prompt code every time? and they wont stack as handlers?
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> only bind it once.
[16:18:04] <robertmaxrees> not multiple times.
[16:18:07] <acidjazz> basically my issue is those unbinds arent working and a 2nd prompt means two clicks, etc
[16:18:39] <acidjazz> only run .on once.. but prompt is a function.. i cant hold previous state
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> right - don't bind within that handler.
[16:18:45] <acidjazz> should this maybe not be a function? maybe an object of functions?
[16:19:05] <acidjazz> so bind when prompt is executed
[16:19:31] <robertmaxrees> just bind.
[16:19:35] <robertmaxrees> don't bind on prompt.
[16:19:48] <acidjazz> this tool is sort of module though
[16:19:55] <acidjazz> i dont want to remove prompt functionality out of this
[16:20:01] <acidjazz> what if you never run prompt on the page
[16:20:03] <acidjazz> useless binds
[16:20:13] <robertmaxrees> juggling binds is a terrible idea imo.
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> very minor amount of memory otherwise.
[16:20:32] <acidjazz> so what are you saying
[16:20:43] <robertmaxrees> if you really care about the overhead, bind a delegated listener to the prompt.
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> and fully destroy it then.
[16:20:53] <acidjazz> ok
[16:21:02] <acidjazz> i dont want to run binds for hte prompt outside of the prompt functionality
[16:21:22] <acidjazz> i dont want people to ahve to run promptInit hte 1st time or some shit and then they can prompt
[16:21:49] <robertmaxrees> not uncommon to have an init method of some kind in a widget, but OK.
[16:22:00] <acidjazz> why not have hte widget control it
[16:22:04] <acidjazz> have the widget run it
[16:22:19] <robertmaxrees> that's fine too, just avoid juggling event bindings.
[16:22:20] <acidjazz> not uncommon for bad code as well :)
[16:22:33] <acidjazz> whats that mean jugglign event bindings
[16:22:39] <robertmaxrees> binding/unbinding handlers.
[16:22:40] <acidjazz> as in turning them on and off
[16:22:44] <acidjazz> whats wrong w/ that
[16:22:45] <acidjazz> its cleanup
[16:22:51] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need it generally.
[16:22:59] <acidjazz> ok lets not be general
[16:23:02] <acidjazz> lets talk about my issue
[16:23:24] <acidjazz> should i fire .on's in prompt? should i be able to unbind in this trigger function?
[16:23:36] <robertmaxrees> you aren't firing "on" anywhere.
[16:23:42] <acidjazz> its a question
[16:23:43] <acidjazz> should
[16:23:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[16:23:49] <acidjazz> nevermind
[16:23:53] <robertmaxrees> you fire events.
[16:24:10] <robertmaxrees> you want to bind listeners to the prompt.  you shouldn't be reacting to events outside of it.
[16:24:48] <acidjazz> keydown needs to be bount to document
[16:24:51] <acidjazz> tahts wehre it fires
[16:25:11] <acidjazz> the click event is being specifically bound to the prompt buttons
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> you can listen for keydown on elements, too.
[16:25:47] <acidjazz> thats bad practice
[16:25:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:25:59] <acidjazz> and could not fire if the element isnt focused
[16:26:03] <acidjazz> nothing nevermind
[16:26:03] <acidjazz> forget it
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/keydown/ then this entire page is "bad practice"
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> unless you're talking about escape keypresses to close it.
[16:26:29] <acidjazz> i already said im using escape
[16:26:55] <acidjazz> check my code and check my question or dont worry abou tit
[16:27:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:27:22] <Sal> hi
[16:27:46] <Sal> how can i set this css using jquery: -moz-transform: translateX(-241px) translateZ(0);
[16:27:47] <acidjazz> yea sorry i just am not in the mood to be ignored and how to generally write code
[16:27:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not ignoring you.
[16:27:54] <acidjazz> told how to*
[16:28:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you a suggestion based on something i've done.
[16:28:13] <robertmaxrees> sorry if that offends you.
[16:28:52] <acidjazz> whats weird is the funciton is being passed to the unbind
[16:28:55] <acidjazz> i can console.log it
[16:28:59] <acidjazz> so i know the unbind is firing
[16:29:46] <robertmaxrees> if you're really set on removing bindings, check out how to namespace events so you can use .on() and .off() generally.
[16:29:49] <acidjazz> aha.. prompt() is being called twice
[16:30:00] <acidjazz> i use .on and .off all the time
[16:30:20] <fas3r> what is the easiest way to blur a div ?
[16:30:29] <acidjazz> fas3r: as in .blur() ?
[16:30:30] <robertmaxrees> then you know how to namespace events and add/remove for those.
[16:30:44] <acidjazz> yes i know all of that
[16:30:59] <acidjazz> all completely nothing to do w/ my question
[16:31:02] <acidjazz> and the solution
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:31:48] <fas3r> acidjazz:  hum like if you have a div and you want to some how hide it ... blur :D
[16:32:11] <z1haze> can i do something like $("nav a:nth-child(2), nav a:nth-child(4), nav a:nth-child(5), nav a:nth-child(6), nav a:nth-child(8),").click(function(evn){ ?
[16:32:13] <Sal> can i do it all in one css() call?
[16:32:25] <z1haze> im trying to have a scrollto navigation but still have some of the navigation links point to external pages
[16:32:25] <acidjazz> fas3r: .hide() ?
[16:32:38] <acidjazz> fas3r: blur either means to onfocus,, like an input you want to not have the cursor on
[16:32:54] <acidjazz> fas3r: .hide() will display: none and hide it
[16:32:58] <fas3r> yes
[16:33:39] <fas3r> it's like you see the background but it's blur on it by an other div ( like the modal from bootstrap ) from example. It goes on the top of the container.
[16:34:14] <fas3r> acidjazz: google will help me :D
[16:34:15] <fas3r> hahahah
[16:34:24] <acidjazz> so a css blur
[16:34:47] <acidjazz> yea google it and its tricky.. you need to sort of blur a child element thats tarnsparent over it
[16:35:04] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: heres a direct question
[16:35:13] <fas3r> acidjazz: blur.js :D
[16:35:32] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: if i fire a .on click event on an element twice, then click the event, will my event fire twice?
[16:35:36] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> event bindings stack.
[16:36:07] <acidjazz> fas3r: sure but its mainly just css
[16:36:22] <acidjazz> thats my issue.. i didnt think they stacked
[16:36:37] <fas3r> acidjazz: yes.
[16:36:41] <acidjazz> i knew they were cool for when the dom changes/etc you dindt have to refresh them
[16:36:46] <acidjazz> but i didnt know i had to clean them up still
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz that's not how .on() works by default.
[16:37:38] <fas3r> with on you have to speficy the element
[16:38:08] <robertmaxrees> right, and unless you use the delegated syntax you still have to "refresh" the bidning.
[16:38:08] <fas3r> .on('event','element',function(e){ ..}
[16:38:28] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees:      $('.tools').on 'click', '.tool.audit > .suboption', Tools.audit.select
[16:38:37] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a delegated listener, yeah.
[16:38:49] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: so that wont stack
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> that relies on event bubbling so you don't have to think about it.
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> yes it will.
[16:38:57] <acidjazz> ok cool
[16:39:04] <acidjazz> so delegated .on's still stack
[16:39:05] <acidjazz> i was unaware
[16:39:05] <robertmaxrees> delegation has nothing to do with "stacking"
[16:39:10] <acidjazz> and i wasnt .off'ing them
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> any event binding does.
[16:39:36] <acidjazz> no worries i had a deconstruction function for all of these ready for something like thiss
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> this is what i was talking about with juggling before - it's why i avoid binding/unbinding multiple times in general.
[16:39:54] <acidjazz> so you just would rather you bind to everything upon pageload
[16:40:00] <acidjazz> bind everything in existance of your app
[16:40:03] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on what i'm doing.
[16:40:04] <acidjazz> bind all the things
[16:40:21] <acidjazz> ok so stop saying in general
[16:40:30] <acidjazz> then ending your subject w/ "it depends" :)
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> whatevs duder
[16:40:57] <acidjazz> im gonna juggle, its more efficient and more control, and faster.
[16:41:10] <robertmaxrees> i disagree about the efficiency and speed, but that's ok.
[16:41:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a tradeoff certainly.
[16:41:38] <acidjazz> booya
[16:41:41] <acidjazz> nice and clean
[17:35:08] <zeroquake> is 'div#tooltip' better than just '#tooltip' in selectors
[17:35:15] <robertmaxrees> worse, actually.
[17:35:37] <zeroquake> ok thank you .
[17:35:57] <zeroquake> worse because it gets all divs and then searches for tooltip?
[17:36:01] <Duvdevan> robertmaxrees why's worse?=
[17:36:12] <robertmaxrees> see what zeroquake said :)
[17:36:31] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/

[17:47:30] <MLM> Is anyone interested in spending a little time looking over my plugin (code review). It has documentation, demos, and commented source to ease the pain of jumping in: https://github.com/MadLittleMods/jquery-carouselss
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> run through a linter.
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> lots of loose equality going on.
[17:48:44] <MLM> Sometimes on purpose for falsy
[17:49:05] <robertmaxrees> e.type == 'keydown' should use strict.
[17:50:20] <MLM> Not disagreeing but what could possibly match the string besides string?
[17:50:21] <robertmaxrees> all of 'em should, ideally.
[17:50:29] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: PHP uses . because it was influenced by Perl
[17:50:52] <robertmaxrees> it's less about "what it could match" and more about not going through the 15 billion operations javascript tries to do to compare ==
[17:51:05] <MLM> ahhh. I did find: `"abc" === new String("abc")   // false`
[17:51:07] <robertmaxrees> systemfault ah that's right - perl homepage
[17:51:18] <robertmaxrees> systemfault wonder why perl uses it.
[17:51:29] <systemfault> :D
[17:52:03] <MLM> robertmaxrees: Will update the necessary equality operators
[17:52:06] <robertmaxrees> MLM also it's a small sylistic nit, but why $.fn[pluginName]['defaults'] = defaults; when you use dot notation everywhere else?
[17:52:51] <MLM> Good point, consistency error
[17:52:59] <MLM> Thanks
[17:53:09] <robertmaxrees> also in css2json you have vars declared in if and for statements which is a no-no.
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> since those blocks don't create new scopes.
[17:53:34] <MLM> Those funcitons came from: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5830517/796832 but I will update/fix them
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> :) i see it happen all the time.
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> same with getMaxTransitionDurationFromChange and a few other places.
[17:54:39] <MLM> Too bad the `let` isn't widely supported
[17:54:50] <robertmaxrees> aye.  them's the breaks though :)
[17:55:17] <MLM> *without transpiler. Breaks where, what?
[17:55:21] <robertmaxrees> i think i'm one of the few people that actually likes javascript's scoping system.
[17:55:34] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Haha :) (I personally hate it)
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> most people do.
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> i think it makes a lot of sense.
[17:56:04] <systemfault> You'll never, ever see me use the "var" keyword again once I can use ES6, only let and const (Both are block scoped)
[17:56:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:56:40] <robertmaxrees> i like the idea of let and const - especially const.
[17:57:04] <systemfault> Yup, me too... and in strict mode, I guess it doesn't fail silently.
[17:57:09] <systemfault> (I hope)
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> the one thing JS doesn't have that i really wish it did was static typing
[17:57:44] <Sal> is there a way to set a value inside a @media?
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> Sal you mean that for #css?
[17:58:14] <Sal> yes
[17:58:23] <MLM> robertmaxrees: I see the `for (var i in css) {` in `css2json` and jshint complains about the i being defined already but isn't it in the if scope
[17:58:26] <Sal> lets say width of a class
[17:58:39] <robertmaxrees> MLM if doesn't create a scope.
[17:58:44] <robertmaxrees> Sal wrong channel mano :)
[17:58:51] <robertmaxrees> MLM only functions create scopes.
[17:58:55] <robertmaxrees> if, for, etc don't.
[17:59:09] <Sal> no, i need to know if there's a way to change the value with jquery
[17:59:09] <MLM> ahh, I only knew `for` didn't
[17:59:18] <Sal> i know how to do it in css
[17:59:32] <systemfault> MLM: The only "unit of scope" in JS is the function (Beside the global "namespace")
[17:59:50] <robertmaxrees> Sal not the value in the CSS file, no.
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to change all the elements using JS.
[18:00:55] <Sal> but, wait, when the browsers loads the DOm and then assigns the styles, doesn't it keep in memory the different styles based on the @media i defined?
[18:01:07] <Sal> i don't think it reads the css on every resize
[18:01:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:01:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually asking then?
[18:01:24] <Sal> wait
[18:02:13] <Sal> .myClass { width: 100px; )       @media (min-width: 1200px) { .myClass { width: 300px; ) }
[18:02:29] <Sal> want to know if there's a way to change the width inside the @media
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> not using JS
[18:02:42] <Sal> the 300px one
[18:02:55] <Sal> hmm
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> once you're in the JS world, you have to select the elements and manually set them instead.
[18:03:32] <Sal> yes, but that applies to the current screen width
[18:03:39] <Sal> and not when > 1200px
[18:03:55] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything about what i'm saying :)
[18:04:05] <Sal> i know
[18:04:32] <Sal> but it seems strange that js can only access the main style buffer and not the @media ones
[18:04:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:04:51] <robertmaxrees> because it only knows what's "active" in the dom.
[18:05:12] <robertmaxrees> if the screen has changed size to fit the media query, it can see those values.
[18:05:27] <Sal> what are you saying? that when browser size changes, it goes back to the css files and loads it again?
[18:05:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:05:37] <MLM> robermaxrees: Just to be clear what do you prefer in terms of declaring variables in and around if/for: https://gist.github.com/MadLittleMods/22b6f1530affb6b5f9b6
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> Sal i'm literally just talking about JS.
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[18:06:00] <Sal> oh, ok, sorry
[18:06:04] <Sal> got it now
[18:06:11] <Sal> its js that can only access active stuff
[18:06:12] <Sal> ok
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> MLM i avoid for loops when possible and simply declare vars before if.
[18:07:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjwkm4sb/
[18:08:03] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> all vars are declared at the top of the current scope because that's what's going to happen anyway :)
[18:09:02] <MLM> ye, lifting. hmmm, I am not a fine of the comma separated declaration but hmmm
[18:09:11] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[18:09:13] <MLM> *not a fan
[18:09:49] <MLM> hard to mess with when you want to set a default for one. Have to take it out and set up it's own var
[18:09:57] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[18:10:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjwkm4sb/1/ i just do this.
[18:10:39] <acidjazz> MLM; why not its easier to read
[18:11:14] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[18:11:24] <MLM> I like to define the variables close to where they will be used especially if kind of a temporary thing
[18:11:44] <robertmaxrees> you know that the js engine will declare them at the top of the function anyway, right?
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> plus for a lot of folks it makes it easier to know what's in the current scope.
[18:12:00] <MLM> Yes, lifting. function asdf() too
[18:12:25] <robertmaxrees> woops glaring syntax error in my prior examples: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjwkm4sb/2/
[18:12:55] <robertmaxrees> it's also helpful in reminding me what's been declared and what hasn't.
[18:14:43] <MLM> I understand the point and maybe I should adopt this mindset going forward. Since it might be easier for others to pick up on what is happening as well
[18:15:20] <robertmaxrees> it's your plugin, but most others will find it easier to read.  same could be said for doing if () {}, instead of if() {}
[18:15:26] <MLM> I do see the downside where you have to go back up to see the default(if it has one, etc)
[18:15:47] <robertmaxrees> your functions should rarely (if ever) be long enough where that's a problem./
[18:16:26] <MLM> Would you consider any of my current functions too long?
[18:16:29] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:16:37] <MLM> good to know
[18:17:12] <MLM> `removeFrame` is pretty hefty
[18:17:13] <b-ot> MLM: memorised “removeFrame`”.
[18:17:22] <robertmaxrees> getMaxTransitionDurationFromChange is big
[18:17:32] <MLM> lol the name but that is what it does. Suggestions?
[18:17:44] <MLM> I do want something shorter if possible
[18:17:56] <robertmaxrees> the function itself is i mean.
[18:18:04] <robertmaxrees> abstract out logic into functions and name them.
[18:18:26] <MLM> `getDurationInfo` is out. Looking through it now
[18:18:26] <b-ot> MLM: memorised “getDurationInfo`”.
[18:18:39] <MLM> What is b-ot doing?
[18:18:46] <robertmaxrees> you're defining new commands.
[18:19:00] <robertmaxrees> because you're preceding statements with backticks.
[18:19:15] <MLM> just used to markdown :/
[18:20:00] <robertmaxrees> i gotta bounce, but that's my input.
[18:20:01] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:20:20] <MLM> robermaxrees: Thank you!
[18:20:21] <MLM> ahh
[18:36:48] <Sal> can someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/
[18:36:48] <Sal> i want to avoid the 2 function calls onScollDown and onScrollUp replacing them with events
[18:36:48] <Sal> but every thing i try doesn't work
[18:36:48] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/1/
[18:36:48] <Sal> sorry, forgot to include jquery
[18:36:48] <MLM> Sal: You put your JS inside the CSS box
[18:36:48] <Sal> hehehe
[18:36:59] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/2/
[18:37:03] <Sal> just copied it bad
[18:37:04] <Sal> sorry
[18:37:18] <Sal> now it works
[18:37:39] <Sal> i know that trigger should gire events
[18:38:24] <MLM> Works for me as well. Also you could also use `console.log` instead of `alert`. `console.log` shows up in the developer tools console
[18:38:33] <Sal> so i was trying .trigger({type:'change', direction: 'up'});
[18:38:47] <Sal> but its not fireing
[18:38:59] <Sal> MLM , can u help?
[18:39:33] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/3/
[18:40:17] <MLM> I don't see any `trigger` call
[18:40:54] <Sal> i know, i took them ogg because i wasn't getting anywhere with them
[18:41:13] <Sal> and i just inserted again the global var scrollDorection
[18:44:25] <MLM> You haven't said what you want besides what you did. I assume you probably want to do `.trigger('scroll', {})` instead
[18:44:34] <MLM> or http://api.jquery.com/scroll/#scroll-eventData-handler
[18:44:59] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/4/
[18:46:39] <Sal> thats doesn't work
[18:46:50] <Sal> i need to know the direction, thats why i build that function
[18:47:04] <Sal> now i just want to implement events instead of global vars
[18:47:23] <MLM> Use the `jsHint` button and hover over the red dots to see the first problem
[18:47:31] <MLM> Also check the developer console for the error
[18:47:42] <MLM> syntax error, not the logic error
[18:48:23] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/5jydm6ke/5/
[18:48:25] <Sal> working now
[18:48:31] <Sal> i forgot the ending '

[19:21:19] <user1> Hi, frontend newbie here. How am I supposed to debug javascript libraries? In a jQuery-based library that I have to deal with, I got "Error: Assertion failed: expected array of children". I looked at it in the Firefox browser console, and it takes me to a line in jquery.js, which is just "error: function(msg) { throw new Error(msg); }"   And? How can I find out which part of the code actually had the problem? I tried searching fo
[19:21:19] <user1> r the error string, but it's just one file (jquery.fancytree.js) out of 15 that the library has, that gets called by them. In a PHP page I could use a debugger and go through things step by step. I don't know how to even start here. I don't even know the entrypoint to whatever it is that asserted.
[19:22:05] <user1> does anyone even enjoy writing frontend code?
[19:26:29] <systemfault> I do... but only javascript intensive stuff
[19:26:37] <user1> haha
[19:27:10] <user1> it's like being asked to build a castle with wet sand
[19:28:36] <MLM> I like front-end development. CSS or JS
[19:28:59] <systemfault> user1: Pretty much... JS is an awful language.
[19:29:04] <systemfault> user1: Fortunately, it's slowly getting better.
[19:29:59] <systemfault> user1: Since you're coming from PHP... You'
[19:30:04] <systemfault> re going from a shit language to another....
[19:30:12] <user1> I'm not, but I was able to start using PHP productively within a day
[19:30:32] <user1> it's just like every other general-purpose language, roughly
[19:31:07] <user1> Javascript is like..."oh, you want this object? call LIBNAME("getObject"). Like, the function call is a string! I can't wrap my head around this stuff.
[19:31:16] <user1> not JS itself, I guess
[19:31:28] <user1> but the libs that build upon libs that build upon jQuery and so on
[19:31:37] <systemfault> The chrome debugger isn't that bad.... beside that, you can set breakpoints using the "debugger;" statement or by using the GUI. console.log is the var_dump of JS
[19:32:29] <systemfault> user1: Most jQuery plugins are awful...
[19:32:33] <kevireilly> user1: regarding your original question, where were you receiving/debugging this error? In chrome as an example, the error should have a > that you can click to get a stack trace to hopefully gain insight to where it occurred
[19:32:34] <systemfault> That's the sad reality.
[19:32:39] <systemfault> jQuery is victim of its own popularity.
[19:33:04] <kevireilly> user1: I personally find that webstorm has a great sweet of debugging and profiling tools built in
[19:33:34] <systemfault> kevireilly: The error messages are often misleading.... for example, they can point to jQuery code :/
[19:33:59] <kevireilly> systemfault: yeah true, I've seen that also, guessing there might not be a full stack trace in those instances
[19:34:04] <systemfault> You sir, deserve a medal for using webstorm, awesome IDE.
[19:34:45] <user1> kevireilly: hmm, I'll try Chrome then. In Firefox I'm not getting any breaks, it just takes me to jquery's error function's definition.
[19:34:52] <kevireilly> I love it so hard... and version 9 comes with spy-js support for node which also gets me going
[19:35:32] <systemfault> user1: You'll probably get the same thing from chrome.
[19:36:02] <systemfault> user1: In the end, even if you were using PHP with a framework, you'd often end up having errors that would point to some framework internals...
[19:36:06] <systemfault> user1: It's the same thing, really.
[19:36:09] <user1> kevinfagan: I'm using PHPStorm, which according to StackOverflow is WebStorm + PHP. Can you tell me how you'd debug this in Webstorm?
[19:36:26] <user1> oops, that was meant for kevireilly
[19:36:34] <systemfault> If you were using "pure DOM", you'd get clearer messages
[19:38:17] <user1> systemfault: unfortunately I'm being asked to modify an existing page, and I thought I'd hack my modifications on the frontend without having to understand too much. like "find out what's causing the error, modify json so that it doesnt happen"
[19:38:41] <user1> I can't rewrite things, it would take too long
[19:38:59] <systemfault> user1: Is that page online?
[19:39:01] <user1> nope
[19:39:36] <kevireilly> user1: I don't believe phpstorm has all the same goodies, but there is a 30 day free trial of webstorm if you're interested
[19:40:00] <user1> systemfault: why do you ask?
[19:40:29] <systemfault> Perhaps I would have been able to help....
[19:44:15] <user1> that's nice of you. I'll keep at it for another 30 min, if I can't make any progress perhaps I can set up a server. I dont actually have the real backend here, I just saved the json from the real reply to a text file and just echo that from my local PHP script.
[19:44:44] <user1> what was that site that offered free Ubuntu VMs that disappear after a day?
[19:47:08] <Kirito> How would you write a replaceWith() function in an onclick HTML attribute? Would it just be something like <a href="#" onclick="$(this).replaceWith('Foo')">More</a>?
[19:48:29] <systemfault> Can't you use .on like competent people?
[19:48:34] <systemfault> If you want to add an event listener
[19:49:06] <systemfault> I would like browser vendors to just... remove those shitty attributes so noobs wouldn't be able to use them anymore.
[19:50:33] <Kirito> I was trying to avoid bloating when I could accomplish what I want with a simple replace function, but I guess that's still considered bad practice
[19:50:34] <fas3r> does somebody is using "js validate" with remote options to do AJAX query .... I can't make it work ... everytime the form is validate before the AJAX query is executed ...
[19:55:46] <user1> kevireilly: wahey, I got the stack trace in Chromium, and found the function, and was able to put a breakpoint! Thanks man.
[19:56:12] <user1> I feel dirty saying it, but firefox seems really behind chrome here
[19:57:56] <kevireilly> user1: oh, nice! glad it worked out for yah
[20:06:09] <kevireilly> Ok, I might be losing my mind. I've got my fishing pole and tackle out and am thinking about doing some fishing. Can anyone think of a reason why an element wouldn't visibly update while it is returning the updated data when requested? IE: $('element').text('hi!'); /* no visible change */ $('element').text(); // returns hi!
[20:06:29] <kevireilly> it works the first time, its definitely the right element, it definitely works from the console, and I'm definitely out of ideas
[20:08:25] <kevireilly> was thinking maybe the original implementation was making a boo boo and there is already an element on the page with the same ID, but that doesn't seem to be the case
[20:11:20] <kevireilly_> On a similar note, a call to remove a parent element doesn't appear to be working. It is acting as if there is another element on the page that I can't see with the same selector
[20:12:01] <kevireilly_> can't see nor find in the dom
[20:19:18] <user1> how hard is it to change the behavior of a table so that selecting with the mouse selects vertically? Eg, if I'm on row 5 cell 5, and I click and drag up, it selects cell 5 on all rows vertically, rather than selecting cells 4, 3, 2, 1, on every row going up.
[20:19:24] <kevireilly_> Doesn't help that I don't have proper debugging tools available and the one that I do have may be providing an instance of the jquery object from a later time frame
[20:19:33] <user1> is that even a jquery thing? is there a name for this I can google?
[20:21:43] <kevireilly_> user1: a couple approaches are available, can you provide an example of the table html?
[20:27:57] <user1> kevireilly: http://pastebin.com/pSXx0CCN
[20:34:04] <kevireilly> user1: one approach http://jsfiddle.net/aep7mq76/
[20:36:33] <kevireilly> can be improved still but I'm trying to get outta work before I turn into a pumpkin
[20:40:46] <user1> thanks kev
[20:41:38] <user1> i'll tweak it for selecting text, when I got a working table :P
[20:42:41] <kevireilly> no prollem
[20:55:24] <cappel> hey everyone
[20:55:26] <cappel> it's really weird problem in my program i am using appendTo function when i am compile it's give error that T is undefined
[20:57:01] <cappel> hey anyone know then plz help me
[21:03:33] <kevireilly> cappel: have you looked at the line number referenced by the error?
[21:03:53] <cappel> yes
[21:04:15] <cappel> it's give error on append To
[21:05:34] <cappel> kevireilly any idea why they giving problem
[21:08:38] <K17> Hey, can someone quickly explain to me the difference btween a "Node" and an "Element" in js?
[21:10:03] <kevireilly> cappel: based on what you just said, remove the space between "append" and "To"
[21:10:22] <cappel> no space dude
[21:10:26] <cappel> appendTo
[21:10:54] <kevireilly> you sure? that was oddly like the error and what you just said.. can you provide a pastie.org of the applicable code producing the error?
[21:13:19] <kevireilly> cappel: it could be a lot of things, but seeing the code would help
[21:14:21] <cappel> i write like
[21:14:23] <cappel>                $("<ol class=list-unstyled> <li id = list4> <div id =arrow class =arro></div> <span id=image  class=blackbo ></span><div id =mod class =module_nam> </div><div  id =icon  class =ap> </div> <div  id =text1  class =module_na> </div> <div  id =bu> </div></li></ol>").appendTo(this);
[21:17:27] <kevireilly> cappel: might be a quote issue. try $('') instead of $("") because $("<ol class="T">") needs to be escaped to work like $("<ol class=\"T\">");
[21:18:28] <cappel> sorry kevireilly don't understand plz write in my code
[21:20:56] <kevireilly> $('<ol class=list-unstyled> <li id = list4> <div id =arrow class =arro></div> <span id=image  class=blackbo ></span><div id =mod class =module_nam> </div><div  id =icon  class =ap> </div> <div  id =text1  class =module_na> </div> <div  id =bu> </div></li></ol>').appendTo(this)
[21:21:31] <kevireilly> $("double "quotes""); breaks because the inner-quotes are not escaped, so $('double "quotes"'); works
[21:21:37] <cappel> ok wait i treid
[21:22:51] <cappel> same one no change
[21:22:54] <cappel> Error: t is undefined .buildFragment@http://localhost:8181/js/libs/jquery-2.0.2.min.js:5:22014
[21:27:33] <kevireilly> cappel: I dunno, you're not providing enough information to really help. Inspect what your compiler is creating and take it from there I suppose
[21:27:52] <cappel> yes you are right
[21:41:21] <user1> whelp, trial by fire complete
[21:41:34] <user1> never thought I'd actually succeed, thanks for your help guys
[21:41:37] <user1> and gals
[21:45:56] <tuskkk___> How to say if $('tester') is a child of $('.tagedit-element-new')?
[21:53:20] <gtristan> tuskkk___, havent tried this myself but probably: $('tester').parent ('.tagedit-element-new') ?
[21:53:37] <tuskkk___> Ok
[21:54:00] <gtristan> check the .parent() docs anyway, I think it does what you need if you use it right
