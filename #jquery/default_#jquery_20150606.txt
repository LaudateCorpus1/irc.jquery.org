[01:18:48] <anshul> I am having a serious issue in which pagecreate event is being called recursively in jquery mobile 1.4.5
[01:18:53] <anshul> kindly help anyone
[01:19:22] <anshul> what could be the possible reasons for this issue?
[01:33:24] <anshul> is anyone available??
[01:33:25] <anshul> ?
[01:33:25] <anshul> ?
[01:33:26] <anshul> ?
[01:35:35] <arthurvr> hey anshul :) What’s up?
[01:41:15] <anshul> Hi arthurvr
[01:41:23] <anshul> I am having a serious issue in which pagecreate event is being called recursively in jquery mobile 1.4.5
[01:44:43] <xll11> Hey, anyone has any experience with tablesorter?
[01:45:16] <flexpaint> http://jsfiddle.net/czra1qgu/ how can i make .right the size of .main minus the size of .left?
[01:45:22] <xll11> http://pastebin.com/Txuz2Ptv -> TypeError: $(...).tablesorter is not a function
[01:50:11] <Eagle_> hello :) I'm working on a form, some fields are not shown if not necessary, I don't want to Get their value ("GET"') to have a clean URL, is there a better to do that than hide & disable for each field? https://jsfiddle.net/9fa8u8u0/ thanks
[03:00:21] <anshul> can sombody point me to pagecreate event documentation for jquery mobile 1.4.5
[03:00:23] <anshul> ?
[03:00:59] <Uhkis> anshul: first step towards answer: ask the question
[03:03:12] <Jattenalle> anshul, im too lazy to set up a LMGTFY, here you go https://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecreate/
[03:03:22] <Jattenalle> you can click around just as well as i can to find the specifics you want
[03:04:40] <anshul> wel I tried asking the question 2 times before already but for you here it goes again: In my application pagecreate event is being called recursively when navigating to the page by clicking a link having data-ajax="false". This recursive calling enhancing the widgets (checkboxradio and rangeslider) again and again and creating them again and again. Could you please help me by pointing to right direction about how I start debugging on
[03:04:52] <anshul> The issue is prominent in iPhone6 plus
[03:05:08] <Jattenalle> sounds like you're doing something wrong
[03:05:19] <Jattenalle> did you condense your issue down to a jsfiddle?
[03:05:41] <anshul> not as of now .....
[03:25:57] <ilhami> hey :) I need some help.
[03:32:57] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/1Yre what am I doing wrong here?
[03:35:41] <ilhami> I want to toggle that option.
[03:54:54] <nezZario> Hey guys
[03:55:24] <fairyrays> hi i am trying to use $.post to push a dataset() to a file on my server and then pull it back out with $.get ..will this work?
[03:55:39] <nezZario> fairyrays, try it
[03:56:17] <nezZario> does anyone know how to do "this": http://jsfiddle.net/qsz6t6q1/
[03:56:35] <nezZario> I want to execute a block after the slideDown is complete
[03:57:06] <nezZario> durr, the parameter is the callback..disregard
[04:18:18] <fairyrays> i dont think it will ;/
[04:19:27] <fairyrays> what goes in is not what comes out for some bizzare reason
[04:20:13] <fairyrays> this is where the trouble starts... check data on server: OK
[04:20:14] <fairyrays> var jqxhr = $.post( "syncmapdata.php",{data: JSON.stringify(jsvisdataset)}, function(retdata) {
[04:20:40] <fairyrays> ..  /* SOME time later in another jquery click event */
[04:21:27] <fairyrays> $.getJSON( mapdatafile, function( data ) {		delete(jsvisdataset);		jsvisdataset=jsonData; /* its a mystery its like its not a dataset any more */ }
[04:21:37] <fairyrays> stuff goes missing
[04:22:51] <fairyrays> stuff == cordinates from the dataset
[04:26:42] <ftopwr> is anyone here?
[04:26:49] <ftopwr> need help with a fiddle
[04:27:45] <JohnDow> trying to pass ajax data to another function but it's not getting it, http://www.hastebin.com/quqifeciga.coffee
[04:27:54] <ftopwr> JohnDow: do you know JS ?
[04:28:15] <ftopwr> maybe you can help me with this fiddle?
[04:28:16] <ftopwr> http://jsfiddle.net/marcusdei/6dm5nvwk/1/
[04:29:16] <JohnDow> demn silly me, i saw it now. Nvm hahaha
[04:35:25] <ilhami> tbh I don't like the x-editable plugin
[04:35:30] <ilhami> it makes me sick.
[04:38:49] <fairyrays> reverse is not a valid func ftopwr
[04:40:33] <fairyrays> you need to prototype reverse on Number
[04:40:38] <fairyrays> i think
[04:40:39] <fairyrays> :)
[04:44:31] <fairyrays> welp that sure does suck got my post/get request sorted so its not behaving strangly but at the last hurdle blunder!! the api didnt work as described either way

[08:28:41] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to get all ids of all tr tags of my page and stores they in an array, but I not get result. Anyone can help me please? https://jsfiddle.net/uL2kuyrb/4/
[09:06:00] <z1haze> is it possible to pass "data-" values into an ajax request?
[09:07:08] <arthurvr> z1haze: just fetch them using api.jquery.com/data and send them with the jQuery.ajax request?
[09:07:24] <arthurvr> $.ajax({ data: $(‘el’).data(‘some-thing’) })
[09:07:57] <sash_> mcfdez87: https://jsfiddle.net/euphwabb/
[09:08:08] <z1haze> I have a table full of items that each row has a download dropdown btn group which each li loads a modal form to download that contains a list of optional files to download.. Previously I had just basically used some php to generate every single form on the page and hide them all until I call them with jquery and show them.. Now the guy wants to add about 100 more forms, and preloading all that html is ridiculous, so I need another way.. Im hopsing I can
[09:08:08] <z1haze> just call the forrect modal/form contents with ajax
[09:08:15] <z1haze> Im crappy with js though
[09:08:40] <z1haze> ok cool arthurvr so let me verify something with you
[09:10:21] <z1haze> soo like $.ajax({ data: $(this).data(‘size’) }) <li data-size="10x10" .....</li> will get me "10x10"?
[09:10:45] <arthurvr> of course you’ll need other things in the jQuery.ajax call but pretty much yes.
[09:10:56] <arthurvr> (if $(this) refers to the element at least)
[09:11:14] <arthurvr> anyways see you all
[09:11:15] <arthurvr> gotta leave
[09:11:26] <z1haze> like i said im crap with js, but doesnt this refer to the element that was click
[09:11:53] <z1haze> so like if i click a link or w/e this will use that specific link's attribs
[09:12:20] <JBreit> z1haze, not nescisarrily
[09:12:34] <JBreit> depends on the code use
[09:12:41] <z1haze> how can I be sure I grab the correct li's data value
[09:12:47] <z1haze> because there is going to be hundreds
[09:13:28] <z1haze> let me know you what I'm doing now: http://www.aqmolds.com/products.php the top table download dropdown is what I have working now. it works fine but now the guy wants to add a ton more for the second section, and I think that preloading all that markup is silly
[09:19:58] <z1haze> hmm
[09:20:35] <z1haze> How can I load the contents of a modal with ajax then?
[09:42:16] <tripflex> anybody got any thoughts on this?
[09:42:17] <tripflex> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30676963/jquery-ui-slider-with-static-and-slidable-values
[09:44:20] <mdev> static is kinda silly
[09:44:34] <mdev> when I see a slider thingy like that and I click it it? I want to see some slidin
[09:45:02] <mdev> so no slidin = confused then abit annoyed, then page exit
[09:45:43] <tripflex> haha i know i just wanted to use a slider but also provide some way to show what existing values are alrady set
[09:46:09] <tripflex> and prevent the user from selecting that same value
[09:54:20] <mdev> most services i've seen that do that, only let it jump to the package, not in between and while I see no reason to disable that, at least during the selection process, you probably can disable it afterwards or display what package they're locked in to another way that doesn't use a slider
[09:54:34] <mdev> but simple disabling the slider on the value may do that too
[09:54:55] <gambl0re> i just realized that you're not actually animating anything in jquery, all you're doing is modifying the css
[10:00:51] <mdev> if you get c33 to modify itself, much faster than jquery
[10:00:58] <mdev> cause of hardware rendering in the browser
[10:01:11] <mdev> but the hassle may not be worth it, jquery easy :)
[10:01:18] <mdev> css rather not c33
[10:07:26] <intent> I am getting strange behavior from a jQuery modal code. It only pops the modal in on the homedir - anything more than that (even homedir/index.php) it will redirect to the homedir, unless I input the relative path in the href (which is at presnt just the anchor), in which case the background changs color as expectd byt the modal does not come in. http://pastebin.com/b9zpBDTT
[10:25:06] <placidb> hi. I'm using a smooth scroll effect on same-page named anchors. my design also allows for some inter-page navigation, also using named anchors. is it possible to smooth scroll to named anchors on a different page?
[11:14:34] <neruda> hi

[11:56:37] <rocky> not sure where the best place to ask this question is... but i'm having some trouble with bootstrap typeahead and bloodhound ... i've got my bloodhound to query a remote json source and if i do mybloodhound.search('foo', sync, async) then it shows i get results back
[11:56:51] <rocky> but when i plug that bloodhound instance into my typeahead as 'source' attribute
[11:57:06] <rocky> when i type text into my typeahead input field, it comes back with "no results"

[13:22:19] <glowdemon1> Hi, noob q: I want a .js file with a bunch of code to be included on another page, how do I go about this?
[13:22:29] <glowdemon1> I searched but kept getting vague results
[13:24:42] <glowdemon1> if I create a file with an event and a function in it, include it with <script src> and I clicked a button that triggers the event, will that work?
[13:25:20] <shoky> if the button is in the DOM already, and the DOM is ready, sure
[13:43:12] <Wansyth> hi
[13:43:14] <Wansyth> <Wansyth> Could someone please help me determine why this is posting data twice?
[13:43:14] <Wansyth> <Wansyth> http://pastebin.com/ufNufXXi
[13:43:14] <Wansyth> <Wansyth> http://pastebin.com/BUZFMc88
[13:43:14] <Wansyth> <Wansyth> Since I changed $('#strength_select').multiSelect({ to jQuery('#strength_select').multiSelect({
[13:43:14] <Wansyth> <Wansyth> it posts data twice on submit
[13:53:27] <glowdemon1> http://jsfiddle.net/kwwofopo/ whenever I click one of the top buttons, it makes my gui go woo woo
[13:54:43] <gambl0re> which button?
[13:56:05] <glowdemon1> login + registerbutton
[13:56:15] <glowdemon1> the ones that trigger the js events
[13:56:43] <glowdemon1> I'll admit that the js looks kinda messy, if anyone knows a better way, let me know
[13:57:13] <gambl0re> i get this {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[13:58:52] <glowdemon1> the bottom button doesnt need to work right now, its about the 2 top buttons
[13:59:02] <glowdemon1> 'Login' 'Register'
[14:06:03] <troop> does anyone use form validation engine?
[14:10:55] <glowdemon1> http://jsfiddle.net/kwwofopo/1/ seems like my login button wont work now, any solutions?

[14:38:19] <pauled> any idea how I can make addition? http://jsfiddle.net/vqnn7v2h/4/
[14:44:40] <shoky> pauled: turn it into a number before adding. and check that it really matches and isn't null.  http://jsfiddle.net/vqnn7v2h/5/
[14:47:03] <pauled> shoky: thanks, nice
[14:47:46] <pauled> shoky: now, I have to know how count the number of ecach matched
[14:48:08] <shoky> hmm, how to count..
[14:48:32] <pauled> maybe match.lenght
[14:48:43] <shoky> nope
[14:49:11] <pauled> length*
[14:49:42] <shoky> some of the numbers are not 4 digits long, you're missing those
[14:50:12] <shoky> /[0-9]+/  should be fine
[14:51:23] <pauled> shoky: which one?
[14:51:35] <pauled> there is 3 digit?
[14:51:39] <shoky> yes
[14:51:46] <pauled> oh
[14:52:08] <pauled> but I don't want to match '?'
[14:52:36] <pauled> shoky: then /([0-9]{3,4})/ should work?
[14:52:49] <shoky> yes.. but  /[0-9]+/  won't match a ?
[14:52:58] <shoky> it means one or more digits
[15:00:55] <pauled> ah yes correct
[15:01:52] <pauled> shoky: I got help from #lichess here http://jsfiddle.net/LcL9vo1y/1/
[15:02:50] <shoky> great job.
[15:04:06] <pauled> I found an updated version from some one here http://jsfiddle.net/vqnn7v2h/7/ it use another way to match numbers
[15:06:06] <shoky> yeah i made that one. but wanted you to figure out how to count on your own. as it is the most basic thing you should know how to do ;)
[15:07:04] <pauled> ah thanks :)
[15:08:02] <pauled> there are kind words for your, I quote him : "i love that they specified the radix, i think strange things can happen without it"
[15:08:25] <shoky> heh
[15:09:08] <pauled> thanks a lot :)
[15:09:31] <shoky> no probs
[15:15:17] <pauled> arround the number :) var new_number = Math.round(average).toFixed(); http://jsfiddle.net/vqnn7v2h/8/
[15:15:49] <pauled> meaning round*
[15:16:47] <pauled> oh, .toFixed() is not necessary here
[16:07:32] <paule32> hello
[16:07:34] <paule32> http://codepad.org/k6xBSv5B
[16:07:48] <paule32> why is weWindow not defined?
[16:12:03] <shoky> because you don't define it anywhere?
[16:15:22] <paule32> shoky
[16:15:23] <paule32> http://codepad.org/k6xBSv5B
[16:15:34] <paule32> this is first part

[16:16:04] <paule32> {
[16:16:04] <paule32>   console.log('111111111111window sc');
[16:16:04] <paule32> };console.log('window sc');
[16:16:19] <paule32> this second
[16:16:32] <paule32> first and last log will output
[16:16:45] <paule32> but not middel 1111...
[16:20:33] <shoky> can't help without seeing the actual code you're including, and where it is included. donno what's LoadFromFile
[16:21:54] <shoky> oh oops loadfromfile is there heh
[16:22:26] <shoky> anyways need to see it live
[16:51:40] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a decent form validation plugin that will stop the user when required fields are blank, leaving some sort of style  on the blank fields? I've tried formvalidation.io (claims to be boodstrap compatible) but the error marks or checkboxes are often misaligned, depending on the field, size of label, etc. nothing consistent or simple.

[19:11:48] <Razerglass> can i use a variable for a selector?
[19:12:11] <Razerglass> lets say i want to use a selector from a array, can i do $(array[2]).each
[19:14:29] <rcyr> Yes
[19:14:53] <mdev> only way to find out is to find out brother!
[19:14:59] <mdev> jquery it up, is fun stuff
[19:15:13] <mdev> although some things are very misleading i'll give an example
[19:15:20] <arc_> i thought you are supposed to pass the array to each
[19:15:42] <arc_> as an argument
[19:16:32] <mdev> I have a webpage with a textarea element where I want to post semi-live logs every few seconds by having jquery send an ajax request and appending results to the textarea, think I could use .append? nope, it "works" but not really, forgot why but it's weird
[19:17:06] <mdev> the clean way is to textarea.val(textarea.val() + newdata);
[19:17:12] <mdev> looks dumb but fixed it
[19:18:02] <mdev> and in my ajax request I send textarea length so my backend knows what to skip in the file
[19:18:36] <arc_> because append does not work on properties, it sets the inner html
[19:18:46] <arc_> value of textarea is a property
[19:18:52] <arc_> if you used a div, you could use append
[19:19:48] <Razerglass> ahh figured out what it was
[19:19:54] <Razerglass> $('#' + array[2]) :D
[19:20:26] <arc_> what is the contents of array
[19:20:40] <arc_> that seems like it will select a single id
[19:20:45] <Razerglass> a ton of strings
[19:21:03] <arc_> # + whatever the contents of the third element of array is
[19:21:12] <Razerglass> yup
[19:21:18] <Razerglass> i forgot the #
[19:21:28] <Razerglass> normaly it would be #element
[19:21:28] <arc_> so why do you need to use each on one thing
[19:21:44] <Razerglass> not even using.each just put that in there as example
[19:21:48] <arc_> oh
[19:22:10] <arc_> your question makes a lot more sense now :p
[20:10:20] <Poppabear> is it possible to use a "wildcard" in a selector for example if i want to do like $('news?').click(); where the ? could be any number ?
[20:11:03] <Poppabear> or any other way to accomplish the task
[20:19:21] <arc_> Poppabear no there is no way to do that. what actual functionality are you trying to create?
[20:22:10] <Poppabear> arc_: i have anchors (links) created dynamically in a loop, and each link has a unique name that includes the news id example <a id="news12" ... and i want to be able to fire the jquery click event when either of them are clicked so that i can perform an action
[20:22:41] <arc_> do they not have a unique class?
[20:22:52] <arc_> if not, i would recommend assigning one
[20:23:24] <Poppabear> ahh i see ... i will try that
[20:23:28] <Poppabear> thanks
[20:28:24] <Poppabear> arc_: how can i have jquery "detect" when the url has been changed in the browser?
[20:29:45] <arc_> it's better if you ask how to do what you want to have happen, rather than how to do how you thought you should do it
[20:30:54] <Poppabear> well its for hash changes .. would something like $(window).on('hashchange', function() { ... work ?
[20:32:27] <arc_> maybe
[20:32:47] <arc_> i don't see a list anywhere of what events jquery handles
[20:34:30] <arc_> the only reference i can find to hashchange in the jquery documentation is here https://api.jquerymobile.com/hashchange/
[20:34:36] <Poppabear> arc_: yea that worked for me, using it for a bootstrap 3 accordian
[20:34:57] <arc_> ok, cool
[20:35:09] <Poppabear> thanks for your help
[20:54:58] <mdev> I just fixed and messaged twillio about their incorrect example code
[20:55:09] <mdev> gave me errors, so weird no one else caught that
[20:55:48] <mdev> was node.js so js related
