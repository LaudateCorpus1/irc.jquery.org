[00:04:23] <workerbeetwo> HI.
[00:04:36] <workerbeetwo> Is there a way to access an oracle database using jquery?
[00:04:49] <Cork> workerbeetwo: no
[00:05:14] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you might have a lib for a server js implementation (ex node.js)
[00:05:29] <Cork> workerbeetwo: but jquery is mainly aimed to be for client side
[00:05:40] <Cork> and those should NEVER have direct database access
[00:06:11] <workerbeetwo> this is a special case in which it is absolute ok to have a database connection. its all save so to speak.
[00:06:28] <workerbeetwo> perhaps javascript has something to offer?
[00:08:27] <sacho> It's not like there's a well-defined way to access a database over HTTP.
[00:08:55] <sacho> so I doubt you'd find a library.
[00:09:06] <sacho> Accessing the database wouldn't be any different than any other http requests you make, though.
[00:10:10] <Greener> I'm accessing my db with an ajax call to a server-side script
[00:10:13] <Greener> Is that not possible for you?
[00:10:46] <Macaveli> Hi Cork, can you help me with some jQ, I have a dropdown that I want to be able to access via my keyboard.
[00:11:16] <Cork> workerbeetwo: the only way would be to have some form of serverscript that taks a query as a parameter run it on the server
[00:11:22] <Cork> and send the response back to the client
[00:11:27] <Macaveli> Please take a look at -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25480659/dropdown-language-keys-available-via-keyboard
[00:11:58] <Cork> workerbeetwo: but that would be an extreme case of sql injection exposure
[00:12:13] <bambanx> http://blogs.atlassian.com/jira/assets_c/2011/07/glintech_wallboard-thumb-600x400-7273.jpg   something like that on a library guys? like a wallpaper where u can put ideas papers drag things ....
[00:12:22] <Cork> Macaveli: you've already asked in so, so wait for the response there
[00:12:31] <Macaveli> Alright
[00:15:26] <workerbeetwo> Cork: suppose client and server are one and the same. no need to involve http there. is there something?
[00:15:50] <Cork> workerbeetwo: if you want to run in a browser, yes it still has to involve http
[00:16:00] <Cork> if you want to run as an extension
[00:16:13] <Cork> then yes you could use system calls in priviliged js code
[00:16:23] <Cork> (well you can in firefox, not possible in chrome)
[00:16:51] <Cork> workerbeetwo: but from js in a page; not possible
[00:17:21] <workerbeetwo> Cork: extension of what?
[00:17:26] <Cork> firefox
[00:18:49] <workerbeetwo> Cork: could I create an extension that is called from my page's js code? and this extension on his behalf has database access?
[00:19:20] <Cork> workerbeetwo: technically, yes you can but it would make the browser insecure to use for ANYTHING other then accessing that one page
[00:19:43] <Cork> workerbeetwo: exposing system calls to the net is a good way to allow your computer to be hacked
[00:19:57] <Cork> just like exposing sql servers to raw sql lines from the net is
[00:20:34] <Cork> workerbeetwo: that said; you might be able to use the browsers built in database?
[00:20:40] <Cork> through indexeddb
[00:20:45] <Cork> ?g mdn indexeddb
[00:20:46] <b-ot> Cork: IndexedDB - Web API Interfaces | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API
[00:21:02] <Cork> won't be a central server though
[00:22:15] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I want to conenct to a specific database of course.
[00:22:37] <Cork> workerbeetwo: then you basically have to run a small server
[00:22:57] <Cork> workerbeetwo: and that shouldn't be a problem
[00:23:14] <Cork> a small access dedicated server shouldn't be costly to run
[00:23:32] <Cork> (server as in a server software, ex written in python or go)
[00:23:43] <Cork> or ruby + thin if you prefer that
[00:25:04] <workerbeetwo> ok. lets assume there is a perl based server script runnning. it would listing on a port. how to call from within js?
[00:25:25] <Cork> it would be a normal http
[00:25:34] <Cork> so you just do an ajax get call for an url
[00:25:49] <Cork> and the server returns ex. json (prob best option) with the data you requested
[00:26:04] <Cork> again, you should not expose raw sql
[00:26:16] <Cork> but if you go this route it is your security nightmare
[00:26:21] <workerbeetwo> Cork is it actally meant to insert data
[00:26:35] <Cork> workerbeetwo: so have a http post with the data to insert
[00:28:58] <workerbeetwo> hmm. ok. its been a while that I programmed such a server myself.
[00:39:45] <workerbeetwo> Cork: thank you
[00:39:48] <Cork> np
[00:41:34] <yeukhon> so $.ajax().then(success,failure)  if i want always i have to use  .done().fail().always()?
[00:44:08] <Cork> yeukhon: well you would have to use .always
[00:44:20] <Cork> you should still be able to use then
[00:44:22] <yeukhon> Cork:  after the .then? or before .then
[00:44:28] <Cork> wither
[00:44:30] <Cork> *either
[00:44:33] <yeukhon> okay let me try
[00:45:34] <Cork> ah, wait no
[00:45:41] <yeukhon> i think after then i have to return a promise
[00:45:44] <Cork> then returns new value
[00:45:46] <Cork> ya
[00:45:50] <yeukhon> yeah.
[00:45:52] <Cork> so use .always().then()
[00:45:58] <yeukhon> okay let me try that too :p
[00:46:56] <Cork> that said, i normally just use .done and .fail
[00:50:31] <yeukhon> yep it works.
[00:50:51] <yeukhon> yeah im thinking about using .always for logging :)
[00:55:53] <Macaveli> It's their a listener for keyboard highlight? Highlight via the tab key?
[00:55:54] <jnhghy> I'm trying to get a combobox (at this point I'm using jquery-ui) but the default combobox doesn't allow new values (ones that are not in the initial dropdown) is there a way to have a combobox that also alows new values?
[00:56:01] <sacho> I'd use a wrappver over $.ajax for logging, instead
[00:56:08] <Cork> Macaveli: focus
[00:57:01] <Cork> jnhghy: when you replace form elements you are in js land
[00:57:13] <Cork> jnhghy: so you need to check if you can add values through the plugin
[00:57:19] <Cork> or tell the plugin to update it self
[01:33:23] <Cork> hmm anyone know what version number is considered an "old" safari browser now days?
[01:34:10] <yeukhon> Cork:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history
[01:34:25] <yeukhon> i think anything lower than 5.0.6
[01:34:40] <yeukhon> i still see people using Leopard 10.0.5 these days
[01:34:59] * Cork nods
[01:35:00] <Cork> thx
[01:41:27] <workerbe1two> Cork: please have a look at this: http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=p402/miniserver.pl . Assume that server is running. how would a simple ajax call look like which trasnports data like a list of objects like X{a="hello",b="world",c="!"}
[01:42:32] <Cork> workerbe1two: $.post(url, { a: "hello", b: "world" });
[02:12:22] <workerbe1two> Cork: hmm . the server did not react at all. I then faked a request using curl which returned 404 {a: "hello", b:"world" } =   . the server is expecting form data and does not seem to handle { a: "hello" , b: "world" } correctly.
[02:20:09] <Cork> workerbe1two: $.post converts that to form data
[02:20:25] <Cork> you can find the real data if you check your browsers network tab
[02:30:26] <mukesh> need help for js
[02:30:26] <mukesh> jquery mobile css conficlt with jquery photoswipe plugin
[02:30:58] <Abishek_> if I had a array [{S: 1} ,{L: 2}], how can i get the key and value when using $.each function?
[02:31:04] <workerbe1two> Cork: it console.logs me the call but there is request that firebug detects.
[02:31:10] <Cork> mukesh: sounds more like you have a css question then
[02:31:39] <Cork> workerbe1two: not sure what you mean, just open the network tab and inspect the data it sends
[02:31:41] <mukesh> query for both css and js
[02:32:04] <mukesh> i dont know whether problem of js or css
[02:32:44] <Cork> abishek: $.each(function() { $.each(this, function(key, value) {  } })
[02:33:01] <Cork> mukesh: if the problem is styling it most likely is css
[02:33:10] <abishek> Cork, thanks let me try that
[02:33:23] <Cork> opps
[02:33:29] <Cork> abishek: $.each(function() { $.each(this, function(key, value) {  }); })
[02:33:39] <Cork> missed the ); end for the second $.each
[02:35:03] <abishek> thnx
[02:35:40] <mukesh> crok: if i remove jquery mobile css path from file then its working properly
[02:35:54] <mukesh> cork: if i remove jquery mobile css path from file then its working properly
[02:36:53] <Cork> mukesh: again so one of the two css files needs to be made more specific (most likely the photoswipe)
[02:37:40] <workerbe1two> Cork: firebug also has such a field. but it does nto matter anyway. both network tabs dont show anything except for initially loaded jquery.
[02:37:58] <Cork> workerbe1two: then you're not making the ajax call at all
[02:38:07] <mukesh> ok thanx
[02:38:10] <mukesh> let me try
[02:41:35] <workerbe1two> Cork: the line before is a consol.log wich works fine. no error given.
[02:41:57] <Cork> workerbe1two: if you then you should have a network entry for the ajax call
[02:53:06] <Macaveli> I have multiple JS files is it possible to include all these into 1 file?
[02:53:16] <slax0r> yes
[02:53:16] <Macaveli> not like copy paste everything but smething like import?
[02:53:23] <slax0r> it's called concatenation and uglification
[02:53:27] <slax0r> you can use grunt for this
[02:53:31] <workerbe1two> Cork: Was my simple mistake. forgot to mention http in the url.
[02:54:07] <Macaveli> slax0r possible without grunt? With something like include o?
[02:54:48] <slax0r> Macaveli: javascript doesn't know a normal include like c/c++/php/others know it
[02:55:05] <slax0r> what you could do, is use your "main.js" to auto-generate multiple <script> tags
[02:55:31] <Macaveli> how you do that?
[02:55:37] <Macaveli> aah just use script tags
[02:55:39] <Macaveli> lol my bad
[02:56:21] <slax0r> var e = document.createElement("script"); e.type="text/javascript"; e.src="file.js"; document.body.appendChild(e);
[02:56:25] <slax0r> this would be pure js way
[02:56:48] <slax0r> but I wouldn't feel comfortable with this
[03:01:58] <abishek> Cork, for the same example, if I had the array [{S: 1} ,{L: 2}], can I use array.index(key) to check if it exists?
[03:02:16] <Cork> abishek: no
[03:02:26] <abishek> how can i check if it exists or not?
[03:02:39] <Cork> you have to loop the array
[03:02:59] <abishek> k
[03:03:53] <Cork> $.grep(arr, function(elm) { return elm[key] !== undefined; }).length > 0
[03:03:57] <Cork> abishek: ^
[03:11:49] <abishek> Cork, I tried that, it always returns false, can you tell me what could be wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/dxd42jog/
[03:13:14] <Cork> abishek: quantities is missing
[03:13:24] <abishek> http://jsfiddle.net/dxd42jog/2/
[03:13:57] <abishek> Cork, what I am trying to do is to aggregate the common keys
[03:14:10] <abishek> SUM(keys)
[03:14:17] <Cork> abishek: so you want an array of all the keys?
[03:14:23] <abishek> yes
[03:14:36] <abishek> am storing it on quantity_exists
[03:15:26] <abishek> is there an issue on the code?
[03:19:22] <Cork> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/dxd42jog/3/
[03:19:36] <Cork> you mean something like that?
[03:20:07] <walidvb> hey guys
[03:20:21] <Cork> abishek: note Object.keys is ie >= 9
[03:20:31] <walidvb> i'm having issues with smth that seemed quite straight-forward, but giving me headaches..
[03:21:50] <walidvb> i have this page, composed of paragraphs, and I need to know when the start of the paragraph has passed the top of the window. However, I feel like .offset() is returning wrong values.
[03:22:35] <Cork> walidvb: you want offset to the viewport or the offset parent?
[03:22:46] <walidvb> to the view port
[03:22:55] <walidvb> (getting a live link)
[03:22:57] <Cork> then offset() should be correct
[03:23:45] <walidvb> this should work;: https://pigeonhole.localtunnel.me/books/redpoint/web_reads
[03:24:45] <abishek> Cork, I am expecting the result [{S:8},{M:2},{L:3}]
[03:25:26] <walidvb> Cork: this, rather: https://friajnxsle.localtunnel.me/books/redpoint/web_reads
[03:25:35] <Cork> ah you want to summarize the values per key
[03:25:55] <abishek> yes,
[03:25:55] <Cork> abishek: why not just create one object of it all?
[03:26:09] <Cork> {S:8, M:2, L:3}
[03:26:14] <Cork> that would be simple
[03:26:34] <abishek> I get the result from an api like [{S:1},{S:3},{S:4},{M:2},{L:3}]; and I need to sum them by keys
[03:26:47] <walidvb> Cork: link is working now.
[03:27:09] <abishek> so I was trying to looping through them and trying to sum it up and store them in quantity_exists array
[03:28:38] <Cork> abishek: does this work for you? http://jsfiddle.net/dxd42jog/4/
[03:29:17] <walidvb> Cork: https://gist.github.com/gists
[03:29:53] <walidvb> weirdly, i get this: http://cl.ly/image/331N0X3q0G0v
[03:30:02] <walidvb> http://cl.ly/image/3V0c3t360i1s
[03:30:23] <walidvb> there's an offset that isn't consistent, it makes no sense to me. been on this for a while, now...
[03:30:48] <Cork> walidvb: could you make a minimal example of what your trying to do in jsfiddle.net?
[03:30:57] <walidvb> so, the red lines are absolutely positioned at the element's offset().top
[03:31:16] <walidvb> Cork: sure. that page is really quite minimal, contains almost only that, though
[03:31:38] <Cork> walidvb: well the link you have (except the images) doesn't work so...
[03:31:39] <walidvb> also, should be mentionned that I use angular to wrap my code
[03:31:52] <walidvb> kk last try wth that: https://pigeonhole.localtunnel.me/books/redpoint/web_reads
[03:32:24] <walidvb> Cork: should be the best way to see, it has all my debugs as well. will try to set up a jsfiddle in the mean time
[03:35:29] <walidvb> works there..
[03:35:41] <walidvb> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/f35gj156/
[03:36:24] <walidvb> my issue debugging this, is that the offset between displayed value and expected value is not consistent, i feel
[03:36:29] <Cork> ugg coffeescript
[03:36:35] <walidvb> Cork: sry :P
[03:36:54] <Cork> well i can read it, it just taste like foul ^^'
[03:37:24] <walidvb> hehe. i'm not yet disgusted by it. imo it's just another syntax
[03:37:45] <Cork> walidvb: your removing the padding of the body
[03:37:58] <Cork> absolute elements isn't affected by padding so ya that will be wrong
[03:38:16] <walidvb> Cork: that was a test, not concluant though..
[03:39:49] <walidvb> Cork: offset _is_ relative to the documentm though, right?
[03:39:52] <Cork> walidvb: if you remove the - padding it looks fine here
[03:40:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/f35gj156/1/
[03:40:12] <walidvb> (i have some content before the paragraphs)
[03:40:23] <walidvb> yes, in the fiddle it works
[03:40:39] <walidvb> (and in the fiddle body.padding was 0, i think
[03:40:55] <Cork> heh
[03:41:16] <Cork> well if the problem isn't reproducable it means the problem is somewhere else
[03:42:33] <walidvb> true
[03:43:01] <walidvb> oh. values are computed too early. hmmm
[03:43:10] <walidvb> font rendering? smth else?
[03:43:40] <Cork> you prob need to wait for onload
[03:43:49] <walidvb> not onready?
[03:43:52] <Cork> yes webfonts can cause this
[03:44:03] <Cork> onready is when the html data has been parsed
[03:44:05] <walidvb> hm. i need to check with angular if they don't do that anyways
[03:44:12] <Cork> onload is when all external resources has loaded
[03:44:24] <Cork> so no not on ready
[03:45:30] <walidvb> so $(document).bind('load', compute) ?
[03:45:59] <walidvb> ->ready
[03:47:12] <walidvb> hm.. still not working. i'm going crazy.
[03:47:52] <walidvb> Cork: you were saying document.onready, corrext?
[03:47:58] <Cork> no
[03:48:04] <Cork> not ready you need onload
[03:48:48] <walidvb> vanilla js?
[03:49:08] <Cork> well or $(window).on('load'
[03:49:43] <walidvb> \o/
[03:49:56] <walidvb> Cork: of course. haven't used it before
[03:50:07] <walidvb> thanks a bunch, what a time waster, this one
[03:50:28] <walidvb> at least I have nice a nice debugging UI now :P
[03:50:32] <walidvb> Cork++
[04:00:31] <abishek> Cork, thnx for this http://jsfiddle.net/dxd42jog/4/ it helps, but I am back to the same problem on how to use these objects. I need to print these values one by one. All of them are as objects, so I cannot each individual ones
[04:01:43] <Cork> abishek: well so loop the array and then loop the objects to handle the key+value
[04:01:46] <Cork> and just print them
[04:02:21] <Cork> abishek: or do you mean the summary isn't usable for you?
[04:02:23] <Cork> if so why?
[04:03:12] <abishek> Cork, the variable sum is [object Object] {
[04:03:12] <abishek>   L: 3,
[04:03:12] <abishek>   M: 2,
[04:03:12] <abishek>   S: 8
[04:03:13] <abishek> }. If I have to print each one of them on an <li></li> how would I do that
[04:04:19] <abishek> Cork, are you getting my issue?
[04:04:42] <Cork> abishek: $('ul).append($.map(sum, function(value, key) { return $('<li>', text: key + ': ' + value)[0]; }));
[04:04:51] <Cork> abishek: *$('ul').append($.map(sum, function(value, key) { return $('<li>', text: key + ': ' + value)[0]; }));
[04:10:02] <clarkk> my question is about some example code for jquery-waypoints, although it's really about general jquery coding techniques. https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/
[04:10:08] <clarkk> I'm struggling to see how the "if" statement in the handler (that tests for up and down direction) could possibly determine which offset is set (in the options obj passed as the second argument). See http://goo.gl/6RmhOk . Could someone explain a technique (in a general way) that
[04:10:09] <clarkk> could achieve this, please?
[04:11:48] <Cork> clarkk: the question doesn't really make sense
[04:12:05] <Cork> are you asking how the plugin is setting the direction variable?
[04:12:29] <clarkk> Cork: sorry that it's not clear. It's difficult to explain...
[04:13:30] <Cork> cause that is done here https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/blob/master/waypoints.js#L110
[04:13:56] <clarkk> Cork: not the direction variable. The offset is different depending on whether the scroll is up or down. If it's down, an offset of 25% is used, and 75% if going up. However, the if statement has nothing to do with the object in the second argument. it doesn't change it
[04:14:26] <clarkk> what I mean is, if it has an influence on the offset property - I really don't understand how
[04:15:32] <Cork> clarkk: ok this sounds very confused so lets take this from the beginning
[04:15:45] <clarkk> Cork: do you know what i mean though?
[04:16:06] <Cork> first way point: if the offset hits 25% and the direction is down
[04:16:15] <Cork> // do stuff
[04:16:27] <Cork> and the second is if offset is 75% and the direction is up
[04:16:32] <Cork> again // do stuff
[04:16:55] <Cork> that is the best i can do to explain the code, cause what you ask make no sense
[04:18:02] <clarkk> hmm, I see what you mean. But I've used this plugin successfully and that is not how I was thinking it worked when I did
[04:18:50] <WrekitRalf> Hey all
[04:19:00] <clarkk> the way I was thinking it worked was, if going down, trigger the waypoint when the offset is 25% lower than 0 in on the viewport
[04:19:08] <WrekitRalf> I've got a problem I've been working on for hours, don't suppose anyone could take a look?
[04:19:12] <WrekitRalf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25476949/how-to-update-jquery-chosen-options-on-keyboard-input-with-ajax
[04:19:26] <Cork> clarkk: it is a variable with a string in it
[04:19:30] <Cork> it can't work like that
[04:19:49] <clarkk> WrekitRalf: you didn't change the question as I suggested. Add a link to chosen, and add your html
[04:20:54] <clarkk> Cork: yes, you are right, and that's why I was confused
[04:21:15] <WrekitRalf> clarkk the html is irrelevant if you know chosen
[04:22:11] <clarkk> WrekitRalf: you shouldn't assume what people need in order to help you
[04:22:58] <WrekitRalf> clarkk: You should in this case :)
[04:24:36] <clarkk> thank you for your help Cork. You've given me some ideas to test my code.
[04:24:46] <Cork> clarkk: yw
[04:44:42] <jebbana> Having tiny issue with counting divs.. If anyone is available please take a look http://jsfiddle.net/xonzcg46/
[04:47:45] <Cork> jebbana: firstly please ask the question in the channel
[04:47:55] <Cork> makes things much easier for ppl to decide if they can answer
[04:48:05] <Cork> secondly $('.countTheDivsInHere')parent().children().length; <-- this line doens't work
[04:48:23] <Cork> and from what you say doens't sound like it will ever do what you want
[04:48:34] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/xonzcg46/3/
[04:48:38] <Cork> $('.countTheDivsInHere').children().length sounds like the correct value
[04:48:59] <Cork> sacho: find will find grand children
[04:49:06] <Cork> and i don't think he wants taht
[04:49:21] * sacho shrugs.
[04:49:37] <sacho> and .children() will find non-divs. :)
[04:49:55] <Cork> so .children('div')
[06:03:38] <msg> hey all
[06:03:52] <msg> I run  $(".userRow").click(function() { somestuff }
[06:03:59] <msg> onload I believe
[06:04:11] <msg> but I don't actually make rows with the userRow class until later on
[06:04:18] <msg> So I think that's why clicking on them doesn't fire anything
[06:04:20] <msg> Is that right?
[06:15:26] <vishaldeep> yes
[06:15:28] <vishaldeep> that's right
[06:15:51] <vishaldeep> you can use $(document).on('click', '.userRow', function() { some stuff });
[06:18:23] <Macaba> hello guys!!

[06:19:02] <Macaba> someone can help me with this script plz
[06:19:18] <vishaldeep> Hey Macaba
[06:19:20] <Macaba> I need to setting for multiple files
[06:19:34] <Macaba> vishaldeep : how's everything going
[06:22:08] <vishaldeep> Macaba, are you using any external library?
[06:22:18] <Macaba> yes
[06:22:22] <vishaldeep> which one?
[06:22:23] <Macaba> ajaxFileUpload
[06:22:38] <Macaba> all that I need is to upload multiple files
[06:22:56] <Macaba> have you made it before?
[06:23:01] <vishaldeep> from ajaxuploader.com?
[06:24:24] <Macaba> isn't that page
[06:24:28] <Macaba> I'm searching
[06:25:47] <Macaba> is this
[06:25:47] <Macaba> http://www.phpletter.com/our-projects/ajaxfileupload/
[06:37:31] <jop008> I have an autocomplete list doing fine but the position of the list item is weird See screenshot. My ul parent is part of a field contain
[06:37:57] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-25_at_15.35.20-btB8IYBy.png
[06:38:39] <jop008> Hard to make a fiddle since my database is attached to it
[06:44:11] <ezio> jop008, then you should extract methods to sufficiently atomic operations so that you can inject data into there.  you may or may not be testing, but at least develop so you can later test
[06:44:35] <jop008> Yeah playing with Chrome styles
[06:44:36] <jop008> now
[06:46:21] <jop008> When I add this style="float:right;width:70%; it looks nicer but the width of the li is a bit slimmer
[06:48:15] <ezio> this is a #css question ... you might want to try box-sizing:border-box but that's not the proper solution
[06:49:20] <ezio> jop008, also a good way to reproduce css errors like this in jsfiddle
[06:49:42] <ezio> right click on one of the parent divs, click inspect element, right click the html and click copy as html
[06:49:54] <ezio> then paste it into jsfiddle, along with the appropriate css
[06:49:59] <jop008> but his is with ajax stuf
[06:50:31] <ezio> yeah but all you need to troubleshoot the css is one snapshot of the current state after an ajax call
[06:57:58] <ezio> jop008, here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/53w67hj9/ i made from my site right now with divs created by javascript
[06:59:15] <ezio> obviously some css is misisng but i'd have to copy a lot of css to make the whole thing look proper
[07:00:26] <ezio> but if i had a problem with the image at the top not centering, someone could help me
[07:01:52] <jop008> I come to this http://jsfiddle.net/53w67hj9/1/
[07:02:00] <jop008> not good
[07:03:32] <jop008> Proud http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/7/
[07:03:40] <jop008> THis is the issue
[07:04:11] <jop008> It looks like the field contain is not handled correct all examples are wo them
[07:21:26] <ezio> jop008, don't pm me
[07:21:36] <ezio> don't pm anyone without permission
[07:23:29] <xxx1337> how do i tell jquery to wait for a while before running a function?
[07:23:31] <xxx1337> removeClickedBorders().delay(5000)
[07:23:43] <xxx1337> i want that to wait 5 seconds before doing that function
[07:24:01] <xxx1337> is that not the correct way of writing that?
[07:24:08] <ezio> setTimeout(function(){removeClickedBorders()), 5000);
[07:24:23] <xxx1337> so i need to use JS for that?
[07:24:25] <ezio> setTimeout(function(){removeClickedBorders();}, 5000);
[07:24:39] <ezio> it's one of the most basic js functions
[07:24:44] <xxx1337> ok
[07:25:00] <ezio> and yes you will have to use js for a lot of stuff
[07:26:48] <ezio> an if statement, technically not jquery
[07:27:00] <workerbe1two> Hi. How to select all selected items in a "<select multiple ...>" ? the field was a single selecter before so I could access by "this.options[this.selectedIndex].value" but how to with multiples?
[07:28:03] <ezio> $('#myshit option:selected')
[07:28:12] <ezio> workerbe1two,
[07:29:13] <workerbe1two> ezio: I wont select my shit.
[07:30:16] <workerbe1two> but thanks anaways. I get the idea.
[07:30:27] <ezio> workerbe1two, $('#myfuckingselect option:select').each(function() { alert($(this).text()); } )
[07:35:58] <gryzor_> Hi. What is the function I should use to replace all options of a <select> element ?
[07:36:25] <gryzor_> I tried .val() and .attr(), without success
[07:36:54] <stef1a> how can i write a function that will look at a group of selects of variable length, notice whenever a selected values changes for _any_ of the selects in the group, and then change the selected value of another select in the group when one has changed?
[07:38:40] <AdamPDotty> gryzor: define "replace"
[07:39:40] <AdamPDotty> stef1a: group = 'class=""'
[07:40:11] <AdamPDotty> $('.class').on('change', yourFunction);
[07:40:14] <_bart> Can I simplify this: $('.featured-message-box input, .featured-message-box textarea') ?
[07:40:19] <stef1a> AdamPDotty: but they're of the form id="_ordering[1]", id="_ordering[2]", etc.
[07:40:24] <_bart> because the parent is the same for both input/textarea
[07:41:14] <AdamPDotty> _bart: better performance is $('.featured-message-box).find('input, textarea')
[07:41:23] <stef1a> AdamPDotty: should i just add a common class to each select, or try to grab them in a group by somehow manipulating that form they currently have?
[07:41:36] <stef1a> (e.g. using a regex or something for _ordering[\d]
[07:41:40] <AdamPDotty> if possible, I would add a class
[07:41:45] <stef1a> why?
[07:41:46] <_bart> AdamPDotty: thanks
[07:42:17] <AdamPDotty> its easier than regex
[07:42:59] <AdamPDotty> that is easier to handle
[07:43:03] <stef1a> hm. okay. then i guess i can grab the number later by looking at the id...
[07:43:15] <AdamPDotty> yep
[07:43:37] <gryzor_> i found the solution. Sorry for bothering.
[07:43:49] <AdamPDotty> and gone

[08:04:49] <nikky70> any body here ?
[08:04:50] <Uhkis> nikky70: a) never do that again, use paste services b) you don't have jquery included
[08:06:23] <AdamPDotty> thaifood: what is it, that you did not expect?
[08:06:34] <thaifood> AdamPDotty: i got it working,  thanks !

[08:06:50] <thaifood> thanks for offering AdamPDotty
[08:07:30] <jop008> Is it normal behavoor that you can not pick from a autocomplete list?
[08:08:16] <Ownix_> Can someone tell me what data line 2 is bringing back?
[08:08:18] <Ownix_> var row = $(this).closest('tr');
[08:08:18] <Ownix_> var nRow = row[0];
[08:08:22] <hlvwrk> o.o
[08:08:43] <AdamPDotty> first element of jquery-set if available
[08:09:09] <AdamPDotty> else it might give an error
[08:12:25] <Ownix_> AdamPDotty: I dont get it, online it says thats a jQuery-Object. In my console they look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/cjnkbf76/
[08:13:12] <Ownix_> I guess im confused on how jQuery works at a basic level. $('table tr').first(); !== $('table tr').first()[0]; ???
[08:17:33] <NoiseEee> Ownix_: correct
[08:17:55] <NoiseEee> Ownix_: the first is your <tr> as a jQuery object; the second is the raw <tr> DOM node
[08:18:34] <Ownix_> NoiseEee: you got back to me as soon as I found it http://stackoverflow.com/a/4348625/1777780
[08:18:40] <jimi_> How can I see a string versio nof a FormData object? like what it woudl look like before submitted
[08:19:10] <Ownix_> XD thanks though this makes a lot more sense. Im using an old version of jQuery DataTables and fnDeleteRow was deleting the wrong rows, if I pass in the DOM element using [0] then all is well
[08:19:25] <stef1a> i have a bunch of divs with indexed ids, like  "my_id[1]", "my_id[2]", etc. and i am checking when they change. when one changes, how can i grab the index from the object?
[08:19:39] <stef1a> will i have to resort to regex, or is there a neater way to do it?
[08:20:03] <NoiseEee> stef1a: parse it out, but ideally the correct way is to stop stuffing data into IDs.  should be <div id='whatever' data-id="2">
[08:20:24] <NoiseEee> that way you can just ask for the .attr('data-id') on whatever <div> you're dealign with
[08:20:32] <NoiseEee> (or data())
[08:20:53] <AdamPDotty> like in this.data('id')
[08:21:36] <AdamPDotty> you are probably in a handler function, where "this" is available
[08:24:40] <Cotillion> Hello
[08:24:50] <Cotillion> does the jqueryui library have the same browser support as jquery?
[08:28:43] <Trudko> guys anybody have experience with select2.js ? i would like to lock the selection and it is possible but it seems too complicated.
[08:29:26] <stef1a> otoh, there is something i'm seing in the console which is called "selector" and equals the selector's id... that might be more reliable / nicer than regex
[08:32:02] <stef1a> oh never mind
[08:32:22] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[08:32:30] <AdamPDotty> then have a nice evening
[08:32:41] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[08:33:42] <Koopz> sometimes i really wonder why IDs are so easy to select comparing to form element's name-attributes
[08:33:44] <zagaza> what's a proper way to add/remove active class on menu items when each menu item corresponds a different page?
[08:34:04] <robertmaxrees> Koopz because IDs were built to be used for that.
[08:34:22] <robertmaxrees> the name attribute is meant to hold a peice of data.
[08:35:11] <Koopz> yeah well but PHP only uses the name attribute :D so every time i want to do javascript things with elements i keep on giving those elements ID attributes because its "easier"
[08:35:29] <robertmaxrees> Koopz that's "the right way to do it"
[08:35:39] <robertmaxrees> also, separations of concern and all that :)
[08:36:05] <Koopz> meh...
[08:36:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:36:19] <robertmaxrees> there's a good reason for it :)
[08:36:25] <Koopz> there might be
[08:36:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[08:37:31] <Koopz> it's just... i'm using ZF2 and need to do a bit more than just adding id="boo" to the element :P
[08:37:47] <deed02392> I perform a bunch of $.get() calls that are dispatched in a loop. How should I register a callback when all dispatched calls have finished?
[08:38:06] <robertmaxrees> deed02392 check out deferred objects - you want to create a queue to work off of.
[08:38:37] <deed02392> yeah robertmaxrees, can I push the deffered objects to an array then do a callback when all those objects are complete?
[08:38:51] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/ :)
[08:38:55] <deed02392> or did you mean something else by queue
[08:38:57] <deed02392> ok :)
[08:39:21] <deed02392> looks good! thanks
[08:39:25] <robertmaxrees> yw
[08:40:20] <Urinprobe> hey, can someone tell me how to use ajax on a div with data-role="page" from a navbar?
[08:40:51] <robertmaxrees> Urinprobe did you check out the tutorial on learn.jquery.com?
[08:41:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, could you elaborate on what you're trying to do?
[08:41:57] <Urinprobe> In fact, I did not. I was just looking at the api...
[08:42:12] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ :)
[08:42:35] <robertmaxrees> basically, you make your request, then in your .done() callback you do your logic to handle the returned data.
[08:43:18] <Urinprobe> didn't jquery mobile offer a widget that did that stuff for me?
[08:43:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile can handle that for you iirc.
[08:43:44] <stef1a> given an object, how do you change its selected value?
[08:43:51] <robertmaxrees> stef1a huh?
[08:43:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean a dropdown?
[08:44:00] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: yes
[08:44:05] <robertmaxrees> .val('newValue')
[08:44:15] <robertmaxrees> where "newvalue" matched the value attribute of the thing you want selected.
[08:44:16] <stef1a> of an object
[08:44:23] <robertmaxrees> "object" is ephemeral.
[08:44:28] <robertmaxrees> what kind of object?
[08:44:40] <stef1a> ... a dom object?
[08:44:45] <robertmaxrees> the .val()
[08:45:06] <robertmaxrees> $('yourSelect').val('newValue'), where 'newvalue' matches the value attribute of the thing you want selected.
[08:46:14] <stef1a> that does not set the selected value. let me show you my code. here: http://jsfiddle.net/v7d0h3rq/
[08:46:34] <robertmaxrees> the value, not the ID.
[08:46:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/brw4utof/
[08:47:16] <stef1a> that is the value
[08:47:25] <Urinprobe> robertmaxrees: thank you, I'll look over that tutorial :)
[08:47:42] <robertmaxrees> stef1a then the ID does not fully match the value of the option you want selected.
[08:48:39] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: this is what sister_dropdown looks like http://jsfiddle.net/v7d0h3rq/1/
[08:48:49] <stef1a> i'm sending 3 as the value
[08:48:54] <stef1a> or 1 or 2 or 4
[08:49:05] <NoiseEee> stef1a: stop using "id" as an attribute when you really mean "data-id"
[08:49:13] <stef1a> NoiseEee: is that possible in Rails?
[08:49:15] <NoiseEee> stef1a: then you no longer need to parse anything
[08:49:21] <stef1a> NoiseEee: that's not my problem
[08:49:53] <robertmaxrees> stef1a http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v7d0h3rq/2/
[08:49:59] <stef1a> i'm trying to change a selected value, not messing with ids anymore
[08:49:59] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[08:50:12] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your value isn't what you think it is.
[08:50:20] <robertmaxrees> or you havea bad selector, etc.

[09:29:15] <OnceMe> I cant believe nobody helped me
[09:29:20] <OnceMe> I am super funny
[09:29:28] <shoky> <input type="password">  ?
[09:34:38] <decx> sweet plugin shoky !
[09:34:42] <decx> and so concise
[09:35:19] <decx> OnceMe no idea what you want, -> to <- with animation wat?
[09:35:28] <decx> this aint #css
[09:37:04] <OnceMe> decx to replace places
[09:37:11] <OnceMe> but replacment should be animated
[09:37:45] <decx> what like -> blah <- to <- blah ->
[09:38:32] <OnceMe> not really
[09:38:48] <stef1a> is it typical for jquery code to work locally but not on jsfiddle.net? is it a sign that something is wrong with my code?
[09:39:08] <decx> then you're not explaining it sufficiently OnceMe
[09:39:17] <OnceMe> -> blah <-  b-> la <-h  bl-><-ah  ->..<-
[09:40:00] <decx> what in the name of oblivion would that be good for
[09:40:23] <OnceMe> for nothing except nice animation
[09:40:25] <OnceMe> ping ping
[09:40:40] <OnceMe> just replace places and rotate element
[09:40:42] <OnceMe> how to do that?
[09:40:52] <OnceMe> rotate by horizontal aligment
[09:41:09] <OnceMe> any idea on jsib jsfiddle whatever decx?
[09:41:50] <workerbe1two> hey. var myarray = new Array(); myarray [ i=0 ]["Whatever"] = "whatever"   throws myarray[ i=0 ] is undefined. How can I write it?
[09:42:19] <systemfault> workerbe1two: What do you want to do?
[09:42:30] <robertbusy> yaaaay meetings!
[09:42:51] <decx> with every new sentence i know even less what you want to do OnceMe
[09:43:12] <devslash> is there a jquery plugin to prompt for a password without depending on an html control
[09:43:14] <OnceMe> I want cool animation which replace places of elements and on the end of animation rotate it by horizontal.
[09:43:16] <workerbe1two> systemfault: I want to store some values in a sane manner. I thought I could declare+ initialize the array and then write to it where ever I want.
[09:43:36] <OnceMe> so E text L
[09:43:38] <systemfault> workerbe1two: It's the i=0 inside the brackets that looks weird.
[09:43:40] <OnceMe> L text E
[09:43:46] <OnceMe> but animated so I can see transition
[09:43:47] <workerbe1two> systemfault: that is a hint for you,.
[09:43:51] <OnceMe> and also L to be rotated on left.
[09:43:52] <systemfault> workerbe1two: And never use "new Array()"
[09:44:32] <robertbusy> workerbe1two just use an array literal.
[09:44:40] <systemfault> workerbe1two: var myArray = []; myArray[i] = {}; myArray[i]['whatever'] = 'whatever'; ?
[09:44:59] <OnceMe> any ideas?
[09:45:04] <OnceMe> IDEas are the best
[09:45:20] <systemfault> workerbe1two: Or var myArray = [{'whatever': 'whatever'}];
[09:46:54] <workerbe1two> systemfault: systemfault I cannot add the values by the time of declaration.
[09:47:14] <workerbe1two> systemfault: and you suggestion did not work. I replaced Array() with [].
[09:47:15] <Macaba> guys!!
[09:47:17] <decx> i still dont get it, so blah becomes halb and you want to see all the steps inbetween and after that happens it should rotate
[09:47:27] <Macaba> how can I convert a number into an array
[09:47:53] <NoiseEee> a number isnt an array
[09:47:56] <Macaba> for example if number is 3 , i need that show me three times in an alert box
[09:48:02] <decx> is that a real question or like a chinese finger puzzle
[09:48:07] <Macaba> like a counter
[09:48:24] <NoiseEee> Macaba: create a loop from 1 <= number ?
[09:48:27] <Macaba> it don't show me 3, instead show me 0, 1, 2
[09:48:30] <systemfault> workerbe1two: It's not my first day writing JS. var myArray = []; myArray[i] = {}; (pretending i = 0) myArray[i]['whatever'] = 'whatever'; should work.
[09:48:44] <NoiseEee> Macaba: arrays are 0-indexed
[09:48:48] <Macaba> with this works?
[09:48:48] <Macaba> var neArr = $.makeArray(o);
[09:49:12] <Macaba> http://jsfiddle.net/jehxLn4h/
[09:49:13] <Macaba> is this
[09:49:35] <Macaba> for example I need that show me three times an alert
[09:49:41] <NoiseEee> Macaba: read what i just typed.
[09:49:52] <NoiseEee> for(i = 1; i<=d1; i++){
[09:50:03] <NoiseEee> also you should probably take the time to learn some JS basics.
[09:51:25] <workerbe1two> systemfault: even myArray[0]["hello"] = world;  results in myArray[0] undefined.
[09:54:11] <workerbe1two> systemfault: ok the second level of that array is the problem. [0] = 'whatever' works. but [0]["right_there"]= 'does not' . I need to declare it 2 dimensional
[09:54:26] <systemfault> workerbe1two: Where is the "myArray[0] = {};" part in your code?
[09:54:56] <systemfault> If you don't do that, you're trying to add a 'hello' key to 'undefined'
[09:56:10] <OnceMe> IDEas are the best
[09:58:24] <clarkk> Using the jquery-waypoints plugin, you can set the config object that contains properties like offset to a function. ie, http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#example-offset-function .  In this example, "this" refers to the DOM object. Is there any way to refer to the offset
[09:58:25] <clarkk> property?
[10:03:46] <workerbe1two> systemfault: Ok. I overlooked that [i] = {} ; it works now. thank you.
[10:03:51] <systemfault> :D
[10:04:57] <mellybean> Has anyone worked on a tool that uses JIRA's issue collector?
[10:12:42] <deed02392> I'm trying to use $.when() with a bunch of $.get() deferred objects I have in an array - but .then() seems to fire before any have actually completed
[10:12:58] <deed02392> I call: $.when(arr) where arr is an array of deferred objects
[10:13:03] <deed02392> is this improper usage?
[10:14:22] <systemfault> deed02392: $.when works with arguments, not arrays. If you have an array of deferred, you can use apply like this: $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises)
[10:16:05] <Trudko> hi guys anybody have experience with select2.js ? I have hard time implementing locked future(where you cant remove selected elements)
[10:22:14] <quansai> hey
[10:25:23] <quansai> I have a problem. I have some feildsets. 3 fieldsets are each group called questions_set. I should be able to move back and forth ( a button named 'Prev' and 'Next' ) within each group between fieldsets. I can already behave that way. The problem is switching groups back and forth upon reaching the end and beginning of each group. Any ideas?
[10:37:54] <w00tb3ast> This might be a strange question but is there a way to force a script to keep running even if another script on the page has errors (this is particularly because of IE8)
[10:38:10] <robertbusy> a try/catch around the offending script.
[10:38:24] <robertbusy> or fix the error script to no longer error :)
[10:38:34] <w00tb3ast> can that be done if the error prone script is outside of my control
[10:38:46] <robertbusy> nope.
[10:38:49] <robertbusy> not afaik
[10:38:52] <w00tb3ast> basically there are some ads that don't correctly define variables and IE is puking
[10:39:48] <w00tb3ast> I wonder how well it will go down if I suggest that we disable ads on IE 8 haha
[10:40:29] <neredsenvy> Quick question I have $('#diagnosis tr").click(function() { $('#tbody').append($(this)); }); it works as intended however sometimes the tr gets added to second table 2-3 times
[10:40:35] <systemfault> Don't bother... any company that isn't retarded won't want to cut revenue to make you avoid fixing crap code.
[10:40:43] <neredsenvy> as if I clicked on the tr element 2-3 super fast
[10:40:54] <neredsenvy> what can I do to fix this
[10:41:51] <w00tb3ast> Yeah I will see how I go systemfault I have a funny feeling that this company is retarded.
[10:42:21] <systemfault> My condolences...
[10:42:33] <w00tb3ast> I have to build a mobile nav tray across all experiences and remove the main navigation coz the CEO's mom said she liked that idea.
[10:42:54] <systemfault> Wow.. I hope it still looks fine :/
[10:42:57] <systemfault> Weird idea though.
[10:43:25] <systemfault> Your situation makes me think of that classic comics: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
[10:43:29] <w00tb3ast> It looks fine.... it's just in IE8 if the ads scripts error the nav doesn't work and coz it all gets hidden it makes the site PREETTTTYYYYY much unusable.
[10:43:39] <w00tb3ast> Haha yeah that one's a classic!
[10:45:59] <neredsenvy> I have this small script https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3cf3273d1b602305df84 when I click on tr element of one table it takes first two child elements <td> well their text value and appends it to another table however I'm having the problem where the first time I click on a tr it gets added however when I click on a second element once than two elements get added to second table.
[10:46:22] <neredsenvy> And when I click for the 3rd time on first table it adds the selected element to the second table 3 times
[10:47:35] <robertbusy> neredsenvy because you're binding a listener within a listener.
[10:47:38] <robertbusy> that's no good.
[10:47:57] <deed02392> systemfault, ok so then it would look something like $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises).then(success(), fail())?
[10:48:26] <neredsenvy> hm lets see if I take it out of the first listener
[10:48:38] <robertbusy> neredsenvy just remove the listener for shown.bs.modal
[10:48:47] <neredsenvy> wooo it works
[10:48:51] <neredsenvy> robertbusy: Thanks a lot
[10:48:57] <robertbusy> yep
[10:48:57] <systemfault> deed02392: Yeah... but as you can probably guess, the success callback is going to have X arguments so if you need an array, you'll have to do var result = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
[10:49:10] <robertbusy> neredsenvy avoid doing a listener within a listener.
[10:49:58] <quansai> How do you guys feel about jQuery Steps? The form plugin?
[10:51:00] <deed02392> systemfault, the success callback and what I do with that data is already run in the $.get()s though?
[10:51:21] <deed02392> I don't think I care about any data once they have all finished though, i've already stored that in a larger scope
[10:51:27] <systemfault> Ah
[10:51:43] <systemfault> Then don't do anything... if success is called then you're good to go
[10:51:46] <deed02392> sorry, let me just try what you've suggested
[10:59:09] <deed02392> damn systemfault, worked great
[10:59:16] <deed02392> this completes my script! thanks a lot
[11:10:15] <srhb_> Hi, I'm having some issues and I'm new to jquery. I'm trying to hide all elements with an attribute except parents of the current clicked one. Am I misunderstanding this? $(".hidden").not($(this).parents()).hide() ?
[11:15:29] <neredsenvy> How do I set click() event for a element that has not yet been added ? Basically I'm adding table rows after page has been rendered each row has a button that removes it however when page loads there is no rows or button yet
[11:21:17] <phoenixsun> there is .map() like function that doesn't necessitate the conversion of objects in array before it can operate on them?
[11:21:25] <phoenixsun> into*
[11:35:53] <mw44118> I'm using deferreds after a LONG time away.
[11:36:59] <mw44118> I have a function that might call and return $.ajax, and might not.  I want to rig up .done() to fire immediately when I don't return $.ajax(...), but wait until the $.ajax part completes when it does return.
[11:38:49] <mw44118> tough crowd
[11:40:23] <shoky> mw44118:  return $.Deferred().resolve();  would do that
[11:42:59] <mw44118> shoky: thanks
[11:43:30] <mw44118> shoky: where does my function go?  Is my function creating and then returning a resolved deferred, instead of returning $.ajax?
[11:44:38] <shoky> mw44118: not sure what you're asking.. yes, i guess?
[11:45:04] <mw44118> I keep getting what goes in what -- my functions should make deferreds, rather than deferred objects get my functions as parameters
[11:45:51] <shoky> uhm. deferred objects "get" functions when you call their .done callbacks and pass a callback
[11:46:16] <shoky> but if you have a function and you want it to return a deferred.. then yes you have a deferred in a function
[11:47:01] <mw44118> shoky: thanks for the help.
[11:50:05] <mw44118> shoky: do you do that return $.Deferred().resolve(); trick sometimes?
[11:56:35] <shoky> mw44118: mmm i've done it once or twice maybe
[12:13:17] <zth> i'm looking for a way to validate whether a string is a jQuery selector (check that it has the correct syntax to be a valid jquery selector). anyone got any idea of how to do that?
[13:10:55] <stef1a> how can i find a select dropdown by its selected value?
[13:17:18] <simonstern> hi i am trying to learn how to send data to my server/php of things with jquery
[13:17:26] <simonstern> would someone mind taking a look at my code ? :)
[13:17:30] <simonstern> its not working :(
[13:17:54] <systemfault> Sure, paste it on a pastebin (like jsfiddle.net)
[13:20:23] <simonstern> thanks! http://pastebin.com/zm9ZrQF8
[13:20:40] <simonstern> so in this example i have a set of data encoded in json
[13:20:50] <simonstern> and i would like to pass it to a php page on my website
[13:21:51] <systemfault> simonstern: Look at line 8
[13:22:06] <systemfault> In JS, objects are pairs of key/value
[13:22:19] <systemfault> Where is the key related to the function on line 8?
[13:22:36] <simonstern> i thought on line 8 i was calling the success function?
[13:23:37] <simonstern> like i thought that part was supposed to be a method to check whether it was successfully sent, although i should probably replace 'data' with the actual name of the variable, 'jsonstuff'
[13:24:41] <simonstern> im not sure i understand what you mean :(
[13:25:33] <simonstern> by replacing that line i don't get the error anymore but i don't get a validation message, or the error message even
[13:26:23] <ciqsteve> Q:  very odd problem
[13:26:30] <ciqsteve> I'm making an ajax call
[13:26:37] <ciqsteve> works ok.. server gets the info.
[13:26:59] <systemfault> simonstern: Have you looked in your JS console?
[13:27:39] <ciqsteve> I can 'pause / break' execution in devtools at the end of the ajax function.   From there execution jumps into ajax and then initiates a call to a url  that looks like this:
[13:27:50] <ciqsteve> domain/path/undefined
[13:27:54] <simonstern> yeah, console isn't displaying either of those messages
[13:27:55] <ciqsteve> wtf?
[13:28:16] <simonstern> systemfault: so strange, but its displaying the "ok lets see" message right above it
[13:28:21] <simonstern> is my syntax and everything else correct?
[13:28:26] <ciqsteve> not ever sure where to begin with that... as soon as that happens the server (django) throws an error which resets all the dev tools stuff
[13:28:46] <systemfault> simonstern: Like I said... key: value
[13:28:58] <systemfault> simonstern: What is the key for the value at line 8?
[13:29:52] <simonstern> i dont know, which value are you talking about?
[13:30:13] <systemfault> simonstern: $.ajax takes an object as argument, right?
[13:30:33] <simonstern> yes
[13:30:50] <systemfault> simonstern: so, type is a key,  "POST" is a value... and so on.
[13:31:02] <systemfault> url is a key, "privatemcattutoring.com/foo.php" is a value
[13:31:11] <systemfault> data is a key, jsonstuff is a value
[13:31:21] <systemfault> Then it become problematic.
[13:31:27] <systemfault> *becomes
[13:31:28] <simonstern> yeah...
[13:31:37] <systemfault> function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) is a value
[13:31:41] <systemfault> What is its key?
[13:31:53] <simonstern> ah, its key is supposed to be 'success' but i didn't include that
[13:31:59] <systemfault> Woohoo! :)
[13:32:08] <simonstern> do i need those other variables? i kept them because they were in the example i used
[13:32:14] <simonstern> awesome :p
[13:32:20] <systemfault> Yeah, you need all of them
[13:32:44] <simonstern> so if i just include the key on the left side of that function, it should be ok? like success: function(jsonstuff, etc..)
[13:32:50] <systemfault> Yes.
[13:32:53] <jimi_> how can i find elements that have class "active"  and some data attribute = true, im trying this $(".active,[data-admit_discharge='true']");  but it is finding rows that have the data attribute, but not active class
[13:33:21] <systemfault> jimi_ remove the comma
[13:33:40] <simonstern> ah now its sorta working, at least im getting to the 'uh oh' part of the error function haha
[13:33:41] <jimi_> systemfault, i tried $(".active,[data-admit_discharge='true']"); this also
[13:33:50] <systemfault> I said, remove the comma :P
[13:34:01] <jimi_> ah, i did.. lol it didnt paste anyhow that finds 0 results
[13:34:02] <simonstern> systemfault: you're a hero :)
[13:34:13] <jimi_> $(".active [data-admit_discharge='true']");
[13:34:19] <systemfault> jimi_ remove the space
[13:34:26] <systemfault> (I didn't say to add a space)
[13:34:35] <jimi_> you didn't say to not add it iether
[13:34:36] <jimi_> :D
[13:34:37] <systemfault> jimi_: You should learn CSS :P
[13:34:38] <jimi_> ty
[13:34:41] <systemfault> You're welcome
[13:34:42] <simonstern> quick question, is the error function part of the success key or is it another seperate key?
[13:34:53] <systemfault> simonstern: It's a separate key
[13:35:00] <systemfault> the "error" key
[13:35:23] <simonstern> ah ok. i didn't see it in the ajax documentation haha
[13:36:10] <simonstern> hmm so i tried to be clever and print the errorThrown to the console to see why its not working but it says "not Found"
[13:36:24] <simonstern> any ideas on how to figure out whats not working? :D
[13:37:20] <systemfault> simonstern: What is your browser and OS?
[13:37:29] <simonstern> chrome, OSX
[13:37:48] <systemfault> Then if you do: command + option + j
[13:37:54] <systemfault> It will open the javascript console.
[13:38:01] <systemfault> You'll be able to see the errors there
[13:38:05] <stef1a> i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/6vh7qhr3/. i'm trying to dynamically update the selected values of each select so that at any given time, no two selects have the same number; they always "swap" values with the select that they want the value of. however, what i currently have does not accomplish this. help?
[13:38:12] <systemfault> In fact, that console should always be opened when you develop.
[13:38:20] <sebastia_> hi guys, I have a collection of objects and I want to find one with a given value in an attribute. jQuery doesn't have collection.find() ??
[13:38:41] <Nomikos> maybe .filter()
[13:38:42] <ciqsteve> Q:  dying here...
[13:39:09] <systemfault> sebastia_: What is a collection of object? You could probably use .filter like Nomikos said.
[13:39:17] <ciqsteve> jquery making a 'ghost' call to an undefined url at the end of an ajax call (that works)
[13:39:23] <sebastia_>  filter() is for elements
[13:39:24] <simonstern> systemfault: i'm actually using the facebook javascript debugger because i was having trouble with getting an authenticated session
[13:39:36] <sebastia_> I have non-element objects to manipulate
[13:39:45] <systemfault> ciqsteve: Need more info :(
[13:39:56] <ciqsteve> not sure what else to give  :(
[13:40:16] <Nomikos> sebastia_: jquery elements, yeah. what is your collection made up of?
[13:40:37] <systemfault> sebastia_: Ah... I think jQuery has a .grep function for that purpose
[13:40:38] <ciqsteve> I can step through the code to the end of the function.. then it jumps into jquery and makes a call to url/path/undefined
[13:40:45] <systemfault> sebastia_: Shitty name... but heh.
[13:40:50] <sebastia_> heh
[13:40:54] <sebastia_> checking ..
[13:42:18] <sebastia_> no luck, jquery won't add grep to this collection  an filter as expected don't work for this
[13:42:41] <sebastia_> trying with callback variation..
[13:43:02] <ciqsteve> ah ha
[13:44:41] <simonstern> hmm interesting, apparently the facebook javascript debugger isn't allowed to send information to my site..
[13:45:11] <simonstern> this is what i saw: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://www.fbrell.com' is therefore not allowed access.
[13:45:51] <Nomikos> I think I walked into that while running 3rdparty JS on facebook, too
[13:46:03] <Nomikos> even if it was locally loaded
[13:47:22] <simonstern> Nomikos: is there a way around it, or do i have to build everything else first? :(
[13:47:54] <Nomikos> buggered if I know, I gave up :/
[13:48:08] <Nomikos> then again, I'm not much of a frontender
[13:49:25] <simonstern> hahaha
[13:50:01] <simonstern> well just from that brief chat with systemfault i feel like my coding skill has levelled up
[13:50:07] <simonstern> a wee bit
[13:50:32] <Nomikos> how much bugfixes to your next level? :)
[13:50:59] <stef1a> has anyone come across the kind of mutually exclusive dropdown select i'm thinking of?
[13:54:46] <simonstern> haha a million bug fixes per level
[13:55:01] <simonstern> but the feeling of having a new tool under your belt is great. as long as i can learn 1-2 solid things a day i'll be alright :)
[13:55:39] <Nomikos> oh yeah
[13:55:53] <Nomikos> that never ends in webdev
[13:56:32] <Nomikos> I'm mostly backend but today was all node, npm, grunt & plugins, coffeescript .. not confusing at all
[13:57:06] <simonstern> haahha
[13:57:19] <simonstern> i'm a huge noob, justttt getting started with javascript :o
[13:57:48] <simonstern> Nomikos: by the way, apparently all you have to do is set 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://sitea.com' on the page you want served, im gonna try that
[14:26:09] <sebastia_> systemfault: yeah man $.grep did it. I'd rather prefer collection.grep(callback) but at least I'm unstuck
[14:30:23] <krambiorix> how can i track an on change event on a h3?
[14:31:17] <simonstern> you know maybe i am a bit of a sicko but i kind of enjoy the challenge of these awful programming problems. 5 hours later you're one line of code ahead of where you were, but still feelsgoodman :)
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix you can't.
[14:35:11] <robertmaxrees> change events emit from inputs.
[14:38:59] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, now that's a pitty
[14:39:37] <robert0> lol
[14:39:47] <robertmaxrees> that's kinda the way it's always been
[14:43:09] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, they should change that :)
[14:43:16] <robertmaxrees> the w3c?  nah
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> no reason.
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> they tried with mutation events but it didn't really work all that well.
[14:43:42] <robertmaxrees> really easy to shoot yourself in the foot.
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> just proxy your stuff through other functions that handle it for you.
[16:22:55] <Greener> Sanity check: $( "#some_ele").html( $( "#another_ele").html() ); should replace some_ele's html with another_ele's, right?
[16:29:19] <krambiorix> Greener, i would think so yes
[16:29:45] <Greener> Thanks. I'll poke it more
[17:59:45] <BillCriswell> My girlfriend can't hang.
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[18:00:41] <BillCriswell> She's been "asleep" for 3.5 hours haha
[18:00:49] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:01:08] <BillCriswell> By that I mean she went a little hard on the liquor earlier.
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[18:01:16] <robertmaxrees> aaaahahahahahahaha
[18:02:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah haha. She was doing well then hit a wall quick.
[18:02:24] <BillCriswell> I went out and played pool and darts with random people for like 2 hours but she's still out.
[18:03:13] <BillCriswell> On the bright side I met a monkey racoon jawn.
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right you're in mexico
[18:05:16] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:06:03] <BillCriswell> You give someone a $5 on this resort and you're like a god.
[18:18:19] <sammych> anything out there to convert a hex string into a normal string?
[18:18:34] <sammych> is JS
[18:18:36] <sammych> in*
[18:18:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3745666/how-to-convert-from-hex-to-ascii-in-javascript like this?
[18:19:20] <sammych> cheers
[18:19:29] <cnap> hey guys i am getting this error: http://prntscr.com/4gi2zn . Does any1 have a clue ?
[18:19:36] <sammych> ascii may have been the key
[18:19:50] <sammych> guess 'string' is too broad a term
[18:19:58] <robertmaxrees> cnap that means you're tossing things around that aren't the right type.
[18:20:29] <robertmaxrees> sammy I searched "javascript convert hex to string" without quotes and it worked fine.
[18:20:40] <robertmaxrees> sammych, i mean.
[18:23:22] <cnap> robertmaxrees: pff I figured. While editing my html file I accidentally erased the include line of a jquery plugin. Thank you
[18:23:43] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[18:23:50] <sammych> did many combos of the same except 'js' instead of 'javascript'
[18:23:51] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple for those.
[18:24:10] <sammych> always had the mssql func, a python solution, processingjs
[18:24:11] <sammych> ugh
[18:24:58] <sammych> DB2 doesn't have a built in unhex function, so I'm writing it on a page and pulling the data
[18:25:42] <cnap> yeah indeed
[18:44:53] <|PiP|> anyone know of a wysiwyg jquery html5 editor plugin? im looking for something that lets me build HTML code with drag n drop elements (e.g. columns, dividers, containers, etc)
[20:08:49] <jrockjiggz> Hi, I seem to be getting memory leaks in chrome and sometimes the browser will lock up Windows 7 and I will need to to a hard reset.. what ways can I troubleshoot for memory leaks
[20:14:57] <sammych> profiler
[20:15:11] <sammych> I feel like a kebab for lunch.
[20:15:21] <sammych> Yes. A kebab will do the trick.
[20:19:56] <Jattenalle> sammych, a wise choice
[20:28:26] <innociv_> How can I replace a form with nothing on submit?  I'm not using ajax. I just don't want it to be double clicked so I want to clear it out.

[20:37:03] <innociv_> Oh I can hide it dur
[21:26:15] <philfromheck> Can someone tell me if the 3 lines of code here are malformed syntactically? http://jsfiddle.net/eswwecq0/
[21:44:32] <Uhkis> philfromheck: you're missing {} from the options
[21:45:06] <philfromheck> Thank you ser! I'm using another method in the interim; but i'll be sure to try that out!
[23:00:53] <prtksxna> If I have two  $(window).load(â€¦) events registered is there any way to know which one will trigger first?
[23:06:02] <Cork> prtksxna: they are called in registration order
[23:18:47] <prtksxna> Thanks Cork!
