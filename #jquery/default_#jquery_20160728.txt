[00:27:26] <EGreg> hey all
[00:27:30] <EGreg> since which jQuery can I do this:
[00:27:42] <EGreg> $('<tagName />', options);
[00:27:56] <EGreg> I used to do $('<tagName />').attr(options);
[01:06:59] <Jerrry> Hello, I am getting some conflicting answers on Google. What is the latest way to use Jquery to take JSON data from a URL and put it into a variable?
[01:08:32] <LeMike> hello :) Am I here right to ask questions about "ScrollMagic" ? Or is it more JS related?
[01:48:55] <EGreg> is === faster than == everywhere
[03:18:09] <ozcanesen> hello how can i add a prefix to url with $.ajaxPrefilter?
[03:18:33] <ozcanesen> my code is http://pastebin.com/vGMzLz4M
[03:18:51] <ozcanesen> I have also tried return options
[03:21:38] <Sonu> Hello what i do for Starting to learn Jquery
[05:00:14] <fred-fri> im making a jqueryscript for adding rows to a table in an endless scroll. the first scroll does load new rows with a call to get new rows from fromId. but subsequent scrolls, fromId will be the same, so the same rows get added over and over again. how can i reinitialize fromId on every scroll? http://pastebin.com/QGWTzq3P
[05:35:34] <codecutter> Maybe this approach will work as it seems to trigger multiple times (should be once).  How can I add a timer so that when function is executed once, it waits n secs for executing again - http://pastebin.com/JH8cPEGV
[05:39:37] <Duikb00t> o/
[06:01:39] <codecutter> finally!
[06:01:40] <codecutter> solved

[07:01:35] <anupsuri> Hi Cork
[07:30:01] <yo-ho-ho-ho-yo> hey
[08:14:28] <dminuoso> Is .load() a blocking function?
[08:16:12] <dminuoso> (I have this bizarre scenario where a $(sel).load() inside a callback on ajax:success is first displayed, and then the $(sel).load() of the related ajax:beforeSend callback (which I would have thought to be impossible)
[08:16:27] <dminuoso> Randomly of course. Not very often.
[08:21:18] <shoky> no, it's not
[08:21:44] <hellyeah-SVG> what
[08:21:51] <shoky> well it blocks until it returns of course, but the ajax is async
[08:23:24] <dminuoso> shoky: So what I just said should be impossible, right?
[08:24:21] <shoky> dminuoso: i didnt really understand what you said ;)
[08:25:19] <hellyeah-SVG> you can async=false in ajax
[08:25:29] <shoky> you shouldn't
[08:25:32] <shoky> ever.
[08:25:38] <dminuoso> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/05ab990f38e2993d0eb12491c186e318
[08:25:59] <hellyeah-SVG> what is the reason of that? because ajax is async in nature and multi threaded?
[08:26:39] <shoky> because if you make it sync it will block the browser until the ajax is done..
[08:26:42] <dminuoso> I have this bizarre race condition, where it first renders my result (ajax:success) and *then* renders the spinner (which happens in ajax:beforeSend). The events are fired in the correct order tho.
[08:26:58] <dminuoso> Ive been breaking my head all morning on thi.
[08:27:45] <dminuoso> To make things really hard to debug, this is a condition that happens only 1 out of 20-40 times or so.
[08:27:59] <hellyeah-SVG> shoky:  we could use worker thread and each worket thread do ajax request with async= false is that doable?
[08:29:05] <shoky> hellyeah-SVG: or.. you could just use async ajax like the rest of the world :)
[08:29:35] <hellyeah-SVG> yes
[08:29:37] <hellyeah-SVG> i know
[08:29:44] <hellyeah-SVG> i am just brainstorming
[08:29:45] <hellyeah-SVG> :D
[08:29:54] <dminuoso> If any of you have an idea what might be causing this issue, that would be helpful.
[08:30:05] <hellyeah-SVG> dminuoso:
[08:30:17] <hellyeah-SVG> i think you should illustrate in jsfiddle
[08:30:39] <dminuoso> hellyeah-SVG: I haven't been able to extract a testcase from this.
[08:30:46] <shoky> dminuoso: it's pretty weird that you're doing in response to ajax events, more ajax requests
[08:31:20] <shoky> also those ajax: events aren't really jquery, i'm not too familiar with that
[08:32:19] <hellyeah-SVG> dminuoso:
[08:32:20] <dminuoso> shoky: They are actually plain ajax events that just got tossed into a sort of namespace by another framework to prevent clashes.
[08:32:29] <hellyeah-SVG> the order happened correctly?
[08:32:39] <dminuoso> hellyeah-SVG: Yes. The callbacks are fired in the correct order.
[08:32:41] <shoky> dminuoso: so this could happen:  beforeSend -> triggers the spinner .load() ajax which takes a long while.  in the meantime, ajax:success of the first request is triggered -> does the 2nd .load() which in this instance is quicker than the first one
[08:32:53] <shoky> dminuoso:  2nd load finishes.  then 1st load finishes.
[08:32:57] <hellyeah-SVG> what was the problem? can you write again?
[08:33:06] <dminuoso> shoky: That was my initial thought, hence my question whether .load() was blocking.
[08:33:19] <shoky> dminuoso: if it was blocking then that couldn't happen
[08:33:28] <shoky> becasue it's not blocking, you don't know the order in which they'll happen
[08:34:26] <dminuoso> So this would be a case where I might want a async: false. :-)
[08:34:30] <shoky> anyways you can use regular $.ajax instead of .load  and then you have control of what happens when its done - if the ajax:success already happened then you dont show the spinner
[08:34:33] <shoky> no, it's not.
[08:34:34] <dminuoso> Yeah.
[08:34:40] <shoky> you shouldn't even use async:false, as i said
[08:34:43] <shoky> ever*
[08:35:02] <shoky> why use ajax for a spinner though
[08:35:03] <shoky> don't do that.
[08:35:37] <hellyeah-SVG> what is spinner btw?
[08:35:42] <hellyeah-SVG> like loading thing
[08:35:46] <shoky> ya
[08:35:46] <dminuoso> shoky: I suppose I never realized I was using an ajax method.
[08:35:52] <shoky> .load is an ajax method
[08:36:02] <dminuoso> Now it becomes completely clear.
[08:36:07] <shoky> you give it a url and it requests it via ajax ;p
[08:36:18] <dminuoso> shoky: How would you obtain a spinner instead?
[08:36:22] <hellyeah-SVG> why you use .load for spinner
[08:36:30] <hellyeah-SVG> spinner wil run forever right
[08:36:35] <shoky> dminuoso: just show it and hide it
[08:36:47] <shoky> or something of the sort
[08:36:58] <hellyeah-SVG> i did something similar to that
[08:37:01] <hellyeah-SVG> just a sec
[08:37:01] <shoky> you can have it be present in the initial html
[08:37:08] <hellyeah-SVG> hmm
[08:37:26] <hellyeah-SVG> your spinner works until success is done
[08:37:42] <hellyeah-SVG> i think you should write js function and call it before "success" function
[08:37:49] <dminuoso> shoky: There was actually silly design reasons why I did it this way.
[08:38:06] <shoky> sounds fun
[08:38:13] <maasha> Hi, I have an issue with jquery-ui tabs containing a floated accordion. Somehow the float destroys the behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/376xo2pa/1/
[08:39:33] <maasha> nm, I can just float the tab container as well: https://jsfiddle.net/376xo2pa/2/
[08:39:55] <shoky> or.. not float either ;p
[08:40:25] <dminuoso> shoky: So Im thinking I might have some container element in which I can have my spinner (which would have a css class to turn it invisible) - and then I can simply .detach() that spinner and .appendTo() where I need it.
[08:40:36] <dminuoso> A simple "toggle on/off" is kind of annoying for other reasons.
[08:40:47] <shoky> dminuoso: sounds fine
[08:41:11] <shoky> dminuoso: btw no reason to .deatch() or .remove() first,  .appendTo  will already do that
[08:41:17] <dminuoso> Ah, very well.
[08:44:37] <Faizan> Hi guys. I'm running into an issue I'm not quite sure how to solve. www.lazeeztandoori.co.uk/menu - as you can see on the left hand side, there are a bunch of buttons that change the current content. The only one working right now is when you click tandoori and it removes the starter pane. I will do this for each of the sections however my question is that
[08:45:16] <Faizan> for instance if tandoori button is clicked, I would .removeClass("hidden") on tandoori, and addClass("hidden") on all other sections, but some might already be hidden, so re-adding the class is pointless. is there a better way to do this?
[08:45:28] <taplar_> it won't readd it
[08:45:41] <taplar_> jquery checks if the class is already there, and if so, ignores it
[08:45:49] <Faizan> right so it wont pose any issues with speed or anything>
[08:45:54] <taplar_> nope
[08:45:57] <Faizan> even to check if the class is already there
[08:46:05] <Faizan> awesome thanks
[08:46:06] <taplar_> worry about speed issues when you see speed issues
[08:46:09] <taplar_> ;)
[08:46:16] <Faizan> haha some solid advice
[08:51:32] <djam90> Hi, is it possible to trigger an ajax fail() from within the done(), for example if the data is not as expected
[08:52:12] <djam90> I basically want to execute the code within the fail() callback, if something was bad within done() callback
[08:52:33] <taplar> no, the deferred has already resolved at that point
[08:52:45] <taplar> extract your fail logic to a named function, and use it in both parts
[08:52:51] <djam90> ok taplar thank you
[08:53:07] <shoky> with jquery 3 you can use .then to create a new promise that fails
[08:53:21] <taplar> ah
[08:53:40] <taplar> so his fail logic would be a following then(null, fn) then?
[08:53:42] <shoky> e.g.  $.ajax().then(function(data) { throw new Error('whutever') })
[08:54:10] <shoky> or a following .fail() is fine too
[08:59:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5w6pkobn/ coolio
[09:03:05] <Justice> if i do var ul = $('someul'); and then later want to append using the variable how?
[09:03:15] <taplar> ul.append(...)
[09:03:18] <Justice> tried $(ul).append and ul.append but nothing happens
[09:03:28] <taplar> what is 'someul' ?
[09:04:06] <Justice> taplar: its a ul, target ".col-filter-grdPersonal ul"
[09:04:22] <taplar> ok console.log(ul.length) and see what you get
[09:04:24] <Justice> using $('.col-filter-grdPersonal ul').append works.
[09:04:34] <Justice> but not the var.
[09:06:12] <taplar> your either dealing with a scope issue or a timing issue, if your dealing with the same selector
[09:07:36] <Justice> hm probably both
[09:08:45] <Justice> yup
[09:14:58] <dminuoso> shoky: So I just looked at my code, tossed half of it out and then realized the whole design was unnecessary. Now my register function requires two selectors, one where the result gets stored in and one where the spinner needs to be toggled.
[09:15:33] <dminuoso> Thank you. :)
[09:17:53] <maasha> I hate when jsfiddle mock-ups work and the real stuff dont
[09:18:05] <taplar> :)
[09:18:09] <maasha> :oP
[09:18:58] <taplar> i like it when the girls stop by, for the summer....... for the summer
[09:33:45] <dminuoso> maasha: The real solution is to simply utilize git. Branch, delete until the problem stops showing - and then you have a test case that you can simply copy and paste into jsfiddle and friends.
[09:34:24] <dminuoso> It beats trying to rebuild something, hoping it is similar enough.
[09:34:33] <maasha> dminuoso: yes, divide and conquer is a classy strategy
[09:34:52] <maasha> It actually saved me this time
[09:35:14] <maasha> And I found the issue in second iteration, so I was lucky
[09:44:40] <jerit> taplar: I found the error I was looking for
[09:44:59] <taplar> cool
[09:45:06] <jerit> seems 1/500th of the posts I'm submitting to my database cause a conflict on the foreign key constraint
[09:45:25] <jerit> but since the data is identical on all the posts I don't understand how that could be
[09:51:26] <hellyeah-SVG> hey again
[09:51:34] <hellyeah-SVG> i am writing something YAY
[09:55:59] <taplar> cool
[09:58:54] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  my code is long but
[09:59:03] <hellyeah-SVG> the error in spesific line can i ask about that?
[09:59:39] <taplar> sure.  i got standup in 2 min so someone else may have to reply though
[10:02:15] <hellyeah-SVG> okey he is gone
[10:02:19] <hellyeah-SVG> let me ask my question
[10:03:38] <hellyeah-SVG> pls create datepicker with + button and open datepicker then click datepicker's title. You will see al months will enlist when you click one of month. It should open with spesific month. But it wont. Error is in line 126 can you help me to fix that issue? http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/5/
[10:03:54] <jose3_> Hello
[10:04:23] <hellyeah-SVG> hey
[10:05:05] <jose3_> I frequently use jQuery Ajax Calling PHP Functions. When I do something like that, and have lets say five php functions I need to use. Should I put all the functions in one file or make each function in its own file?
[10:05:46] <taplar> jose3_: more of a php question
[10:06:39] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  care to look my code :)
[10:06:47] <taplar> just popped it open
[10:08:33] <hellyeah-SVG> the code is fine just line 126 didnt work i dont why is that it worked when i do it seperately
[10:10:18] <taplar> try this
[10:10:40] <taplar> open the console, create the datepicker field, choose your month
[10:10:50] <taplar> repeat that a few times while watching the console
[10:12:54] <hellyeah-SVG> no error in console
[10:13:04] <taplar> nope
[10:13:06] <hellyeah-SVG> i will print out my month selection to the console
[10:13:13] <hellyeah-SVG> hmm
[10:13:16] <taplar> your already printing out something
[10:13:24] <taplar> did you notice anything with that log?
[10:15:09] <hellyeah-SVG> i see something
[10:15:26] <hellyeah-SVG> everytime i select a month it print something +1 time more
[10:15:32] <taplar> yup
[10:15:33] <hellyeah-SVG> i dont know it is related
[10:15:40] <hellyeah-SVG> is it related?
[10:15:41] <taplar> might not be, but it is an issue
[10:16:49] <hellyeah-SVG> i am not sure what cause that :p
[10:18:05] <taplar> no?
[10:18:35] <hellyeah-SVG> you just click one time
[10:18:44] <hellyeah-SVG> and it works two or three time or four times
[10:18:59] <taplar> that should immediately tell you something
[10:19:06] <hellyeah-SVG> the only thing i can think of there is one more click fevent for box1
[10:19:49] <hellyeah-SVG> hmm
[10:20:23] <hellyeah-SVG> can you give me tip :D
[10:20:51] <taplar> you already saw the console
[10:21:01] <taplar> every time you do it, you get one more log
[10:21:25] <hellyeah-SVG> yes
[10:21:31] <taplar> so....?
[10:24:02] <hellyeah-SVG> i have something i dont know it is true
[10:24:27] <hellyeah-SVG> there is ui-datepicker-title click event and box1 click event
[10:24:47] <hellyeah-SVG> when you click datepicker-div-title it will trigger box1 click event
[10:24:58] <hellyeah-SVG> and when you click box1 it will fire multiple time
[10:25:00] <hellyeah-SVG> s
[10:25:05] <hellyeah-SVG> i guess that doesnt make sense
[10:25:06] <taplar> why?
[10:25:13] <hellyeah-SVG> does it make sense?
[10:25:24] <taplar> the event happens once
[10:25:34] <taplar> the handler is executing multiple times
[10:25:35] <taplar> why?
[10:26:07] <hellyeah-SVG> hmm
[10:26:24] <hellyeah-SVG> i dont have any idea
[10:26:26] <hellyeah-SVG> :/
[10:26:39] <taplar> when do you bind the event handler?
[10:26:56] <hellyeah-SVG> when you click a month
[10:27:06] <taplar> how many times does that happen?
[10:27:44] <hellyeah-SVG> you click one month at a time
[10:27:51] <hellyeah-SVG> so it should happen once
[10:28:00] <taplar> how many times are you binding
[10:28:24] <hellyeah-SVG> ah
[10:28:27] <hellyeah-SVG> 12 times
[10:28:38] <taplar> every time
[10:28:55] <hellyeah-SVG> well yeah
[10:29:06] <hellyeah-SVG> i mean sorry i become stupid sometimes
[10:29:07] <taplar> lol, that's not a good thing dude
[10:29:18] <taplar> i know we've said in the past, you don't over bind
[10:29:23] <hellyeah-SVG> when you click month, click event will be binded
[10:29:40] <taplar> and basic rule, typically you don't bind to something from inside another event handler
[10:30:14] <hellyeah-SVG> sorry i forgot something
[10:30:25] <taplar> that's a very important thing to remember
[10:30:27] <hellyeah-SVG> i am under mobbing 6 months thats not excuse i am aware
[10:30:36] <taplar> write it down, sticky it to your cube wall if you have to
[10:31:04] <hellyeah-SVG> you said bind event to month just one time right?
[10:31:24] <taplar> for each event handler, you only want to bind to a given element once
[10:31:27] <hellyeah-SVG> but click event must be triggered when you ckick month any time right
[10:31:54] <taplar> triggering an event handler doesn't have anything to do with binding
[10:32:24] <taplar> it will be triggered at some point after the binding.  or not.  not guarenteed
[10:32:29] <taplar> but you only want to bind once
[10:32:58] <taplar> you either do that by only binding once on existing/new elements, or you use a delegate binding to bind once to a parent
[10:33:11] <hellyeah-SVG> ic
[10:33:23] <hellyeah-SVG> delegate sounds more doable
[10:33:35] <hellyeah-SVG> since i already used that
[10:34:03] <hellyeah-SVG> thank you
[10:34:09] <hellyeah-SVG> i willm look at it tomorrow
[10:34:15] <taplar> cool
[10:34:19] <hellyeah-SVG> i have to eat now have a good day
[10:34:24] <taplar> u2
[10:43:45] <dwebber88> Heya!
[10:44:10] <katronix> Hi all, I have a page that is using the jquery Sortable plugin which I've found does nothing on mobile devices. Would adding the jquery mobile plugin fix this? Not seeing sortable as one of its plugins
[10:44:58] <taplar> the jquery ui sortable?
[10:45:06] <katronix> taplar: yes
[10:45:31] <dwebber88> Any idea on how to extend the if(message.error) part (https://jsfiddle.net/c4rmLd97/), so that the function set as success is only executed in case of the else?
[10:46:32] <taplar> katronix: i'd have to play around and/or look at the source.  it may be that sortable only triggers on mouse events, not touch events
[10:47:16] <taplar> dwebber88: do what now?
[10:47:39] <dwebber88> taplar: Actually just look at the comment in this updated fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/c4rmLd97/2/
[10:48:11] <taplar> then make your endpoint return a non 2XX 3XX status code
[10:48:25] <taplar> one of the 400 would probably be fine
[10:48:48] <taplar> your ajax will then do the error callback instead of the success
[10:48:49] <dwebber88> that would actually go to error, while its an application error, rather than a server/client miscommunication
[10:48:58] <taplar> that's fine
[10:49:23] <dwebber88> it looks rather bad in your console having a 4xx code when trying to provide feedback to a user
[10:49:29] <dwebber88> also for search engines
[10:49:35] <taplar> typical users are not looking at their consoles
[10:49:44] <taplar> and from a rest standpoint, 400 makes sense
[10:50:47] <dwebber88> i found multiple best practises, one being your suggestion, the other being error checking in the success callback (since its a valid http response)
[10:51:39] <taplar> not all status codes are http related
[10:51:39] <stennowork> in jquery, how can i select a link by its href attribute? Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: a[href=#handling-type]
[10:51:46] <taplar> such as 201
[10:51:47] <dwebber88> i found the latter to be a lot cleaner and more correct (not looking from a rest standpoint), and it works just fine except for i'm looking for a way to actually extend the function in order to always have the error checking without having to provide the code for it in every ajax call
[10:51:48] <taplar> created
[10:52:05] <taplar> response codes are not constrained to client server communication
[10:52:07] <shoky> stennowork: use quotes [href="..."]
[10:52:31] <taplar> in regards to an api, response codes are used in forming the contract between the client and the server.
[10:52:35] <dwebber88> they are intended for the http protocol, not for the application layer
[10:52:41] <taplar> i disagree
[10:52:57] <taplar> the http protocol doesn't create anything, so why have a 201?
[10:53:13] <dwebber88> fair point
[10:55:11] <stennowork> shoky, thanks, that did the trick
[10:55:28] <dwebber88> taplar, would you use http response codes for server-side form validation too?
[10:55:39] <taplar> i would
[10:55:43] <taplar> personally
[10:55:57] <stennowork> shoky, i was a bit confused because stuff like $("[name=foo]") works fine without marks around the foo
[10:56:03] <stennowork> shoky, maybe its because of the hash?
[10:56:24] <stennowork> or the dash..
[10:56:25] <dwebber88> stennowork, dont need quotes
[10:56:32] <stennowork> dwebber88, i do.
[10:56:41] <stennowork> dwebber88,  Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: a[href=#handling-type]
[10:57:07] <stennowork> dwebber88, which is fixed as shoky said when i put '' around #handling-type
[10:57:16] <taplar> imho, always use quotes on attribute selectors
[10:57:20] <dwebber88> http://jqueryenlightenment.com/jquery_enlightenment.pdf look there on page 41
[10:57:25] <dwebber88> stennowork
[10:57:38] <shoky> stennowork: ya
[10:58:07] <stennowork> shoky, thanks
[10:58:17] <stennowork> dwebber88, please read the conversation more carefully
[10:58:39] <stennowork> dwebber88, it was because of the hash as i stated
[10:58:53] <dwebber88> which is stated on page 41 of that pdf
[10:59:02] <stennowork> yes, but you said 'dont need quotes'
[10:59:22] <stennowork> a[href=#handling-types] DOES need quotes because of the hash
[10:59:34] <dwebber88> so no thanks, but back to something i said earlier ^^
[10:59:50] <taplar> i think we're all agreeing here.
[10:59:52] <taplar> so...
[10:59:55] <shoky> except that page in the pdf is talking about selecting by ID, not by attribute
[11:00:00] <shoky> also .. ancient pdf
[11:00:13] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[11:00:16] <dwebber88> which doesn't change the selection behaviour
[11:00:28] <dwebber88> shoky, note the double #
[11:00:45] <shoky> hm?
[11:01:49] <shoky> that's talking about escaping characters in an ID selector, not about quoting characters in an attribute selector, but anyways.. we all agree it needs quotes
[11:01:52] <stennowork> i was just confused by dwebber88's random "doesn't need quotes" comment, i thought it was related to the problem i had, but apparently they meant something else
[11:02:06] <stennowork> anyway, yeah
[11:02:16] <dwebber88> stenno apologies
[11:02:29] <stennowork> no worries
[11:02:35] <stennowork> it is solved now, thanks for the link
[11:03:23] <dwebber88> stennowork as shoky said its quite ancient, but it does cover some good info
[11:10:03] <stennowork>  i wonder if there's something new i didn't know about jquery yet in that book
[11:10:18] <stennowork> apart from using quotes if your identifier contains certain characters
[11:10:53] <taplar> a better point would be to try to avoid attribute selectors in the first place, :P
[11:11:27] <stennowork> oh it still mentions .live :D
[11:11:30] <stennowork> ancient indeed
[11:12:08] <stennowork> does .data() now work in jquery as expected?
[11:12:15] <shoky> actually that pdf _doesn't_ talk about quoting attribute selectors :P
[11:12:19] <stennowork> i.e. ONLY with data- attributes?
[11:12:37] <shoky> "as expected" is whatever the docs say about it..
[11:12:51] <shoky> and no, it only reads from data- attributes, once
[11:12:55] <stennowork> i remember that .data used to attach data to the virtual dom node (not sure if thats the right expression)
[11:13:02] <stennowork> ok
[11:13:22] <shoky> it stores the data in an internal cache, in js memory
[11:13:33] <stennowork> so $("bla").data("foo", "bar") would write <bla data-foo="bar">
[11:13:34] <shoky> not on any virtual dom node, whatever that is ;p
[11:13:38] <shoky> no.
[11:13:44] <stennowork> damn
[11:13:49] <shoky> as i said, .data() only reads from data- attributes
[11:13:50] <shoky> doesn't write
[11:13:55] <stennowork> only read, ok
[11:13:56] <shoky> if you want to write to an attribute, use .attr()
[11:13:58] <stennowork> yep
[11:14:02] <stennowork> thats what i am doing now
[11:14:09] <stennowork> i find this inconsistent and confusing
[11:14:28] <shoky> attr  reads and writes to attributes
[11:14:29] <shoky> :)
[11:14:42] <stennowork> .data reads from attributes but doesn't write to them
[11:14:44] <shoky> .data() is for  data _related_ to a DOM node
[11:14:48] <stennowork> thats the inconsistency i meant
[11:14:52] <shoky> not data that is stored in a DOM node's attributes
[11:15:04] <stennowork> well apparently it partly does
[11:15:11] <taplar> you could potentially use prop() instead of attr()
[11:15:24] <shoky> for data-* attributes? nah
[11:15:28] <taplar> no, not data
[11:15:38] <shoky> then for what?
[11:15:43] <taplar> non data fields
[11:15:50] <taplar> attr() doesn't cache, does it?
[11:15:52] <shoky> what's that
[11:16:01] <shoky> you lost me :S
[11:16:14] <taplar> prop('id'), prop('class'), prop('name'), etc
[11:16:27] <stennowork> .data() shouldn't read from data- attributes imo
[11:16:28] <shoky> full sentence plz
[11:16:54] <shoky> stennowork: can't fully disagree with you there :)
[11:17:10] <stennowork> or better, make .data() read _and_ write to data- attributes, and do the internal cache with a differently named function
[11:17:13] <taplar> you can use attr('id') or prop('id') to get an elements attribute value, but prop would cache where attr would not, right?
[11:17:23] <shoky> why would you want to _write_ to a data-attribute ?
[11:17:47] <shoky> taplar: huh no
[11:17:55] <shoky> neither does any caching
[11:18:21] <stennowork> i cannot think of a specific use case right now
[11:18:29] <shoky> there you go, then :)
[11:18:42] <shoky> it reads from data-attributes because they figured that's what's useful
[11:18:47] <shoky> i find it useful personally
[11:19:08] <stennowork> you would probably write to it on node creation
[11:19:15] <shoky> no, you woudln't
[11:19:26] <shoky> because, storing data in the DOM is bad.
[11:20:16] <shoky>  only useful in the initial rendered html, lets the server put data-attributes related to a dom node, on the tag itself
[11:20:29] <shoky> then, you just read and write with .data()
[11:20:29] <dwebber88> taplar: thanks for your thoughts on http response codes
[11:20:41] <shoky> it reads the initial server data from data-attributes
[11:21:20] <taplar> dwebber88: np. just the opinion of a random guy in chat, ;)
[11:24:14] <stennowork> hmm
[11:26:17] <shoky> taplar and no you can't use prop to get an attribute's value, generally. only for a few specific ones
[11:26:19] <stennowork> i see your point there i think
[11:26:48] <taplar> i need to repeat that a few times.  some how i've hardwired that into my brain.
[11:28:04] <shoky> for 'id' some others, the browser keeps the property and attribute in sync with each other, so if you change id attr it'll also change the prop and vice versa
[11:28:16] <shoky> but .prop('blarg') has nothing to do with .attr('blarg')
[11:28:57] <taplar> yeah and prop('checked') and attr('checked') are not the same, :)
[11:28:59] <shoky> technically,  $elem.prop('blarg') translates to elem.blarg,   $elem.attr('blarg') translates to elem.getAttribute('blarg')
[11:29:39] <shoky> where  elem.blarg  is just a regular js property on a js object (that happens to represent a DOM element)
[11:30:10] <shoky> and elem.getAttribute('blarg')  gets the attribute that was on the initial html tag for that element
[11:30:36] <shoky> (except for the few specific ones like id,href,checked,etc )
[11:31:07] <shoky> well and of course elem.getAttribute also will get the modified attribute, if it was modified with .setAttribute sometime
[11:31:50] <graphettion_> Instead of 'blarg' use 'zombocom'
[11:32:18] <shoky> dissertation is now complete.
[11:32:31] <graphettion_> :)
[11:33:06] <shoky> do you just idle on zombocom all day at the office now that they aren't giving you much work?
[11:41:45] <graphettion_> shoky, pretty much
[11:42:16] <taplar> like a zombie
[11:42:30] <graphettion_> Ironic how you're getting paid to watch something else you want to do.
[11:43:02] <taplar> "you're" ?
[13:06:42] <Taplar2> Book my Internet is down :(
[13:09:11] <Taplar2> Plus side, the bistro had chicken noodle soup

[13:19:20] <graphettion_> lol
[13:19:47] <taplar> trying to get me to watch something like that while i'm eating soup.  terrible
[13:21:31] <graphettion_> Better than eating a steak.
[13:23:15] <robertmaxrees> nothing is better than steak.
[13:24:03] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, can't argue with pure logic.
[13:24:08] <graphettion_> mmm steak
[13:24:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need logic.  that's just a fact.
[13:24:30] <taplar> idk, are we talking talking about a single item, or like as a whole meal?
[13:24:34] <graphettion_> Should be a law.
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> air is necessary to breathe.  water is necessary to drink.  steak is tasy as all hell.
[13:25:02] <graphettion_> ^
[13:25:22] <taplar> cause i'm pretty big on mashed potatoes or some good mac n cheese
[13:25:29] <robertmaxrees> taplar so long as "whole meal" is a 4 inch thick tbone.
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> bistecca alla fiorentina?  gtfo.
[13:25:50] <graphettion_> lol
[13:26:04] <robertmaxrees> new york strips? gtfo even more.

[13:27:13] <robertmaxrees> oh and ducks.  ducks are pretty rad.  they live their lives being total jerks and they dgaf, then you can cook 'em in their own fat for one of the most demented displays of humans conquering other animals.
[13:27:27] <taplar> lol
[13:27:35] <graphettion_> As long as I can have my sacred goat.
[13:27:48] <taplar> i'll take turkey
[13:28:21] <taplar> even more so cause it's associated with, probably my most beloved food of all.  pumpkin pie
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> ah the holiest of foods.
[13:30:07] <taplar> that's like my moms bribery food
[13:30:25] <taplar> will you do this for me?  idk.  i'll make pumpkin pie.  fk yeah!
[13:31:01] <taplar> for pumpkin pie, i'll reformat your pc for the zillionth time, sure
[13:36:42] <jerit-> taplar after 10,000 tests (made possible by that loop from last night - thanks a million for that by the way), my API has only errored 10 times. So, 1000:1 chance of the error ocurring I'd say
[13:47:52] <arc_> taplar install cloudready (chromeos) on her pc and never have to do that again
[13:48:41] <taplar> eh, i'm exaggerating a bit.  not that bad, but i do have teamviewer on her box so i don't have to drive all the way down there for the occasional maintenance
[14:27:51] <taplar> crickets
[14:28:01] <Jerrry> Hi taplar

[14:59:53] <klow> Hey folks, I'm looking to hire someone for a UI design, I'm coding the backend API.  Few weeks project part time I'm hoping, if you are interested please privmsg me with your rates/info about your experience
[15:38:44] <robertmaxrees> klow this really isn't the right place to solicit work fwiw :)
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> I might look around at job boards or check out the freelance channels.
[15:46:27] <taplar> always find that interesting.  never knew people sought out freelancers so actively
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that's ever been successful.
[15:51:43] <SpecialTechnique> How can I add classes to elements that are dynamically created by a user scrolling?
[15:51:51] <robertmaxrees> gotta select them.
[15:52:05] * taplar restrains a pokemon joke
[15:52:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:58:46] <Ahrotahntee> so I've been looking around and can't seem to find what I'm looking for: Is there a way to check the size of an $.ajax() upload in beforeSend?
[15:59:03] <robertmaxrees> like the size of the file?
[15:59:08] <Ahrotahntee> yeah
[15:59:32] <Ahrotahntee> I want to have the server pass an object down on page load (in a script block or something) to specify the max body size, and I want to set up my $.ajax() to not send if it exceeds that size
[15:59:36] <Ahrotahntee> save everyone involved some time
[15:59:41] <Ahrotahntee> (and bandwidth)
[15:59:51] <taplar> i forget if there is a property on the file in the file list
[15:59:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> $("#yourFileInput")[0].files[0].size;
[16:00:22] <Ahrotahntee> oh man
[16:00:24] <Ahrotahntee> talk about tunnel vision
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:00:33] <Ahrotahntee> I was trying to go through jqXHR to get the payload size
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> oh, hah.
[16:00:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, back off fromt here, instead.
[16:01:34] <Ahrotahntee> that's the one
[16:01:42] <Ahrotahntee> thanks a bunch :)
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> deffo!
[16:02:36] <taplar> you want tunnel vision if your underage
[16:03:18] <SpecialTechnique> robertmaxrees taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/54zhxv1L/ - more or less, what I'm trying to do.
[16:03:40] <taplar> this.alt?
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique do you have contorl over the code adding the elements?
[16:04:20] <SpecialTechnique> No not really, I'm a UX/UI guy, so I just use tampermonkey to mess with the companies code for a bit to build prototypes
[16:04:26] <robertmaxrees> D:
[16:04:30] <SpecialTechnique> D:
[16:04:44] <SpecialTechnique> It's a pain trust me D:
[16:04:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just modify the server-side code?
[16:05:03] <SpecialTechnique> cause they have a strict process on that...
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, why not just target using an alternative selector specific to the stuff you wnat?
[16:05:38] <SpecialTechnique> they didn't add any f'ing classes to any of the elements...
[16:05:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use other stuff to select on.
[16:06:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to hook into the global ajax events to get what you're looking for.
[16:08:28] <adamsilver> How do I execute some JS code when an element with a specific class is dynamically added to the DOM?
[16:08:48] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver do you have control over the code adding it to the document?
[16:08:53] <robertmaxrees> because the ways to do that are very hacky.
[16:09:07] <robertmaxrees> and can cause all sorts of funky perf issues.
[16:09:29] <SpecialTechnique> Well I only need it to show a prototype D:
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique *shrug* then the global ajax event listener is the way to go.
[16:09:59] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, find an appropriate selector to get what you need.
[16:10:46] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: I am sending the html from the server but I am losing the form bindings after replacing the form
[16:10:47] <SpecialTechnique> taplar: this.alt grabs the alt attribute of the element
[16:11:04] <taplar> your keeping the class in there?
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver ah, so you're trying to re-bind event handlers?
[16:11:32] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: yes
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> DOn't do that :) use delegated event listeners instead.
[16:11:43] <SpecialTechnique> Nah, I'm trying to create a class that doesn't exist with the alt because that's the only way I can identify the element - at least thats the way I did it :\
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:12:10] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver also http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:12:23] <SpecialTechnique> robertmaxrees: I tried ajaxComplete() before, and it didn't seem to do anything. I may have done it wrong though.
[16:12:27] <relipse> does anyone know why my slick careousel goes down like 1000 px before the pagination buttons: http://staging.handofhelp.com/resources/products/view/The-Suffering-or-the-Glory
[16:13:04] <adamsilver> robertmaxrees: the second link looks like exactly what I am looking for. I will try it. Thanks.
[16:13:18] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver they're both about the same toipic ;)
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> same content, really.
[16:13:26] <SpecialTechnique> or should it be ajaxSuccess?
[16:13:34] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique $( document ).ajaxComplete(function() {})
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> is that how you used it?
[16:13:40] <SpecialTech> yea
[16:13:55] <robertmaxrees> is the content getting ajaxed in by jquery?
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> or is it using the native xmlhttprequest object?
[16:14:32] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[16:14:52] <SpecialTech> its ajaxed in
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:15:19] <robertmaxrees> right, but is it using jquery's $.ajax or the native ajax setup.
[16:15:29] <SpecialTech> oh oops
[16:17:44] <SpecialTech> It seems like native
[16:17:57] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:18:08] <robertmaxrees> can't use jquery handlers for non-jquery ajax.
[16:18:10] <SpecialTech> I'll confirm
[16:18:13] <SpecialTech> hmm
[16:18:35] <robertmaxrees> if that's the case, you're kind of stuck.  you can use mutationobservers, but those are kind of gross.  there's another spec out there but i can't remember what it is.
[16:18:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd honestly try to find a unique css selector, no matter how gross, and go from there.
[16:20:21] <SpecialTech> K so I confirmed, they're using data-lazy-load="content"
[16:20:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:27] <SpecialTech> so lazy load - _ -;
[16:20:38] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> the jquery plugin?
[16:20:45] <SpecialTech> yea it seems so
[16:20:54] <robertmaxrees> then the global handlers SHOULD work.
[16:21:09] <robertmaxrees> but just screw around with selectors.  you'll find something that'll work.
[16:22:01] <SpecialTech> is lazy load really "ajax" though?
[16:22:12] <robertmaxrees> if the page is not reloading, yes.
[16:22:15] <robertmaxrees> you are using ajax.
[16:22:22] <robertmaxrees> unless you're doing something with JSONP.
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> which i doub.
[16:22:29] <robertmaxrees> *doubt
[16:24:08] <sickn> does someone know a image archive or gallery script or something similar with an voting&comments function? maybe jquery & php based?
[17:24:09] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees - figured it out
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> what'd you do?
[17:24:25] <SpecialTech> created a class using the anchor text :l
[17:25:23] <SpecialTech> https://jsfiddle.net/08oxqzc9/
[17:25:48] <SpecialTech> same idea, but instead with an element that already exist on the page
[17:26:01] <SpecialTech> thanks a lot!
[17:26:57] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused.
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[17:28:36] <SpecialTech> Sorry, I should add more context, I'm trying to create a hover functionality that ties with some images that do not exist on the page. In order for the images to load on the correct hover, I needed to have that specific name of the element/product
[17:28:57] <robertmaxrees> you know you could use delegated listeners to handle all of that, yeah?
[17:29:01] <SpecialTech> yea
[17:29:06] <SpecialTech> I'm using on(mouseover
[17:29:06] <SpecialTech> ;l
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not a delegated listener.
[17:29:22] <robertmaxrees> need a second arg to on.
[17:29:40] <robertmaxrees> and then you can get all the info you need from the element without needing to do any prep work ahead of ti,e.
[17:29:42] <robertmaxrees> *time
[17:32:57] <SpecialTech> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/08oxqzc9/1/ - that's what I was doing for like 4 images ;l
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not a delegated listener.
[17:33:57] <robertmaxrees> wait is it? i've never seen anybody use on like that.
[17:34:25] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, you could've just gotten that data in your event handler, but fair enough.
[17:38:13] <SpecialTech> yea, I mean, it works, and now I have specific selectors for each item :D
[17:38:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't see why you'd need tghem, but cool.
[17:38:42] <SpecialTech> cause the images dont exist
[17:38:54] <SpecialTech> so I needed a way to tie the images to the correct product
[17:39:26] <SpecialTech> well they exist on the server, just not on the page I'm testing on
[18:01:34] <taplar> i feel like the mouseenter and leave part could be done with css
[18:02:06] <taplar> eh, maybe not
[18:02:46] <taplar> oh yeah, it's a nested element
[18:17:32] <graphettion_> taplar, keep your nesting away from my elements!

[18:27:00] <graphettion_> Seen that one.
[18:27:12] <graphettion_> Stand up singing, pretty good.
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> weee
[18:29:07] <robertmaxrees> and taplar that 4 chords video is a little inaccurate ;)
[18:29:14] <robertmaxrees> still pretty funny.
[18:29:18] <taplar> :)
[18:29:43] <robertmaxrees> (protip: those songs don't all actually use those 4 chords, the melody just fits over 'em, and they actually change the progression part of the way through the video)
[18:33:17] <taplar> while funny, it's making me want to listen to some of these songs again, lol
[18:33:22] <robertmaxrees> right?
[18:35:05] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, HEY!
[18:35:21] <robertmaxrees> hey buddy
[18:35:26] <graphettion_> waddup?
[18:35:35] <robertmaxrees> oh y'know, writing code.
[18:35:39] <robertmaxrees> y tu?
[18:35:58] <graphettion_> Meh, same, kind of.

[19:20:40] <taplar> oh journey i love you
[21:05:21] <YottaByte> is anyone here familiar with jquery datatables? https://datatables.net/
[21:36:46] <martin290> how would i create an ajax call that continually gets the "percent done" and displays that to the user?
[21:37:22] <martin290> so say i have a php process that gives back a number for each loop, i'd like to have it display that number to the user
[21:41:40] <neilpdx> martin290 do you want all activity on the page to stop until it's done?
[21:42:55] <martin290> neilpdx: no
[23:37:26] <rfc19> Hello, I'm trying to make theses images clickable, but am having no luck. Excuse the pasted source in the CSS and JS fields: https://jsfiddle.net/jay1rwkp/2/
[23:53:17] <Yepp> I can get the element but I can't modify it. I'm getting a specific child of a parent using index number
[23:53:23] <Yepp> currently doing it like this
[23:53:32] <Yepp> $(this).find(options.childSelector)[pageNumber].html()
[23:53:52] <Yepp> "this" = ul for example
[23:54:28] <Yepp> console says html() is not a function
[23:54:57] <systemfault> Sure, because it's not.
[23:55:19] <systemfault> Using [] on a jquery object "unjqueryfies" the node
[23:55:26] <Yepp> ohh
[23:55:29] <Yepp> so i guess eq?
[23:55:29] <systemfault> use .eq(pageNumber) instead
[23:55:32] <systemfault> Yes
