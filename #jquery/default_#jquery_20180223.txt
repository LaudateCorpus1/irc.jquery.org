[04:43:01] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to figure out how to get the index of a nested element...
[04:43:40] <bobdobbs> say I have div#foo > div > div > div#bar > (p*4)
[04:44:11] <Cork> #bar > :nth-child(4)
[04:44:20] <Cork> #foo is pointless as you already have #bar
[04:44:30] <Cork> ids are page unique
[04:44:41] <Cork> (and for the same reason you don't need the tag name)
[04:44:53] <bobdobbs> oh wait, I might have expressed the problem inadequately
[04:45:04] <Cork> preferably make a jsfiddle.net
[04:45:07] <bobdobbs> I'm gonna take a breath and think for a moment...
[04:48:24] <bobdobbs> Scratch that question. This might be a better way of asking it...
[04:49:22] <bobdobbs> The expression jQuery('.cast-control a') returns 5 elements. If I click on one of them, I'd lke to know which one I clicked on by index
[04:50:34] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '.cast-control a', function() { var index = $('.cast-control a').index(this); });
[04:50:35] <bobdobbs> So, I'd like to get a number between '0' and '4'
[04:50:50] <bobdobbs> geez dude. you make it look simple
[04:50:51] <bobdobbs> no fair
[04:50:57] <Cork> :)
[04:51:53] <Cork> bobdobbs: make sure you understand what the code does
[04:52:02] <Cork> (meaning don't just copy paste it)
[04:52:30] <bobdobbs> yup. I get the click wrapper, and I've already got the docs for 'index' open in my browser :)
[04:52:42] <Cork> nice
[04:56:25] <bobdobbs> Thanks Cork
[04:56:28] <Cork> np

[12:13:18] <grapheti> grek, you should prolly ask #node.js or ##javascript

[12:13:44] <grapheti> prolly #node.js
[16:07:28] <Guest64757> what is this stuff
[16:07:32] <Guest64757> func()()
[16:07:39] <Guest64757> i call it boobs
[16:08:11] <Guest64757> hows that even work
[16:26:52] <shoky> Guest64757: it's same as:  var x = func();  x();    i.e. calling func returns another function, which is then called too
[16:28:35] <Guest64757> oh
