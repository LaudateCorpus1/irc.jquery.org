[02:27:04] <Guest81637> how to change from class to data-filter instead? --> http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/2/
[02:37:27] <Guest81637> someone knows? :)
[02:52:38] <aways> Hey ;
[02:52:50] <aways> Question about Jquery.getScript
[02:53:35] <aways> How can use this method to load a "module" like a var module = (function () {})();
[03:01:31] <aways> because once loaded is done, I can't access to module.method or res.method (like function (res) {})
[03:03:09] <Cork> aways: you can't
[03:03:44] <aways> Cork, ok I can't return any value from ajax
[03:03:44] <Cork> $.getScript is the same thing (basically) as $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { eval(data) })
[03:03:56] <Cork> you can return the xhr obejct
[03:04:15] <Cork> so you can later do returnValue.done(function() {})
[03:04:39] <Cork> aways: basically the core problem is network calls is async
[03:04:51] <aways> Yes but i'am on the resolve()
[03:04:53] <Cork> so you can't "wait" for the data to come back so you can return it
[03:05:23] <Cork> then you can do done(resolve)
[03:05:40] <Cork> you still won't have a return value though
[03:06:47] <aways> Cork, so it's not possible to get a return value like object
[03:07:17] <aways> $.getScript('').done(function (res) { res.method() });
[03:07:59] <aways> because res is eval(url);
[03:08:24] <Cork> aways: jquery uses $.globalEval to not leak context
[03:08:35] <Cork> and it doesn't return values
[03:08:49] <Cork> also 3.2 uses <script> for content evaluation
[03:09:14] <aways> ok so i can't load an object from ajax.
[03:09:19] <Cork> yes
[03:09:24] <aways> Have you a trick ?
[03:09:33] <aways> to do that
[03:09:45] <Cork> you could load it with $.ajax and eval it yourself
[03:10:07] <Cork> note though, that it will make csp unusable if you go this route
[03:10:45] <aways> Ok not really good
[03:10:59] <Cork> as the core point of csp is to forbid eval
[03:11:08] <Cork> as it is a gigantic security hole
[03:11:12] <aways> yep
[03:11:36] <aways> No solution instead write into the same file :)
[03:11:42] <aways> Ok thanks
[03:11:49] <Cork> my recommendation is to not dynamically load the modules, just statically include them
[03:12:11] <Cork> and fyi, 3.2 way of evaling ajax data https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/DOMEval.js
[03:12:27] <aways> Yep but same pb like few days. this html part with all inside like script and css is load by $.load
[03:12:36] <aways> so the global context ins't accessible
[03:13:17] <aways> I need to use a Require module loaded at the top
[03:13:23] <Cork> not sure why $.load would make global context inaccessable
[03:13:40] <Cork> the other way around possibly, but not that way
[03:15:38] <aways> Ok thanks for response.
[03:15:52] <aways> I will used my Require module

[04:55:22] <aways> Question about chained .append()
[04:56:07] <aways> How can get result of append to append child on a child $('<div>').append('<select>').append('<option>');
[04:56:22] <aways> Here append('<option>') refer div not select
[05:06:01] <Cork> aways: you should create the complete structure and then append that instead of first appending the parent
[05:06:25] <Cork> aways: cause each time you modify a child tree that is connected to the dom the browser has to do a full reflow of the page
[05:06:31] <Cork> and that is VERY costly
[05:07:34] <Cork> aways: so instead do var select = $('<select>'); select.append(); (...) $('<div>').append(select).appendTo('#target')
[05:07:59] <Cork> where (...) is the loop where you append all the options
[05:08:27] <neo_> hi guys
[05:08:46] <neo_> do you think need always correct errors ?
[05:09:00] <neo_> I now do site where many javascript errors
[05:09:05] <Cork> what needs correct errors?
[05:09:10] <neo_> in console
[05:09:22] <Cork> ah, yes you should fix javascript exceptions
[05:09:28] <neo_> in that site many errors and client say don't need that correct
[05:09:44] <neo_> and I notice it's perfectly work
[05:10:02] <neo_> it's only break code inside <script></script>
[05:10:15] <Cork> that is most likely cause the js that doesn't work has a fallback solution that doesn't depend on js
[05:10:23] <Cork> you should still fix the errors
[05:10:28] <neo_> if we do separated <script>here error</script> <script>it's wihtout errors</script>
[05:11:00] <neo_> but client don't want , I also want fix it but there errors from other former scripts and I don't know how it fix
[05:11:04] <neo_> need delete all
[05:11:18] <neo_> all can work without fix perfectly ?
[05:11:25] <Cork> no
[05:11:39] <Cork> javascript exceptions mean the javascript engine stops execution
[05:11:48] <Cork> you can never fully know what that will effect
[05:12:18] <neo_> why ? It's can change some global variables ?
[05:12:41] <Cork> it isn't safe cause you can't ever fully know what code you expect to run won't
[05:12:53] <neo_> I don't know how that all fix, I tried and it's so hard to do ....
[05:12:58] <neo_> no I can expect
[05:13:00] <Cork> as it depends on if it is in the stack that got the exception
[05:13:15] <neo_> just I open new tag script and there can execute my new code
[05:13:29] <Cork> tag doesn't matter
[05:13:33] <neo_> why ?
[05:13:36] <neo_> doesn't
[05:13:38] <Cork> tag is just a loading of script text
[05:13:43] <neo_> I noticed it
[05:13:47] <Cork> it isn't execution scopes
[05:13:49] <neo_> but it's work separately
[05:13:58] <Cork> no it doesn't
[05:14:07] <neo_> there maybe not see other exeption
[05:14:41] <neo_> see when I had recent code in script and there was first part code with error last part code did not work
[05:14:44] <Cork> if you don't care and want to do this solution no matter the answer, why are you even asking?
[05:15:00] <neo_> and I wrap last part code in separated script and it work perfectly
[05:15:27] <neo_> it means tag script have your own domein of view
[05:16:00] <neo_> just made discover  for yourself
[05:16:17] <neo_> before I always thought need correct all errors and not not
[05:16:19] <neo_> now not
[05:16:34] <neo_> just before my all code was in one <script>
[05:16:39] <neo_> and in one function ready
[05:17:25] <neo_> and if we do every function separately it errors in determined function can't influences on other functions
[05:17:34] <neo_> I noticed it only now
[05:17:47] <aways> Cork ok
[05:17:48] <neo_> do you think this is important ? :)
[05:17:52] <aways> Perfect
[05:18:10] <neo_> aways, perfect ? and I can do work without correct errors ?
[05:18:25] <Cork> neo_: he wasn't commenting to you
[05:18:32] <neo_> client say needn't correct it
[05:18:36] <neo_> Cork, clearly
[05:19:23] <neo_> Cork, when I had earlier slow comp , javascript errros very slow down server ...
[05:19:43] <neo_> Cork, it's need correct for increase performance ...
[05:19:55] <neo_> it's bad impact on it
[05:20:25] <neo_> sorry for my poor English )))
[05:20:32] <aways> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/y2hny7u6/
[05:20:49] <aways> So this code appendTo at the end. it's ok for reflow
[05:21:02] <neo_> jQuery actually difficult language ....
[05:21:09] <Cork> ya.. but you should really use a template for that
[05:21:35] <aways> Yep ; but i need to rewrite entire project for that :)
[05:22:10] <Cork> not really
[05:22:36] <aways> I listen you
[05:22:39] <aways> :D
[05:23:00] <Cork> one min
[05:23:04] <aways> Yep
[05:23:24] <Cork> i need to parse the blob of js first
[05:23:46] <aways> lol
[05:25:00] <neo_> one error within script ruins all next code
[05:26:28] <Cork> aways: https://jsfiddle.net/y2hny7u6/1/
[05:37:10] <aways> Cork nice !
[05:37:13] <aways> Thanks
[05:37:20] <Cork> np
[07:01:05] <D4KKKK> Hi guys
[07:06:42] <D4KKKK> Anyone Alive ?
[07:49:19] <Guest81637> some help with this one --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45143462/filter-multiple-data-attributes
[08:27:33] <AdamPDotty> I once had a solution.
[08:56:13] <MikeD_> ... but it precipitated.
[11:24:04] <catbadger> Never fear: I is here.
[11:32:04] <tsukasa_> can someone help me?
[11:32:18] <tsukasa_> i'd like to have an input field with a % at the end
[11:32:29] <catbadger> got a fiddle?
[11:33:04] <tsukasa_> catbadger i'm not really sure what to do.. i feel like if i set the value while the user is typing it would be weird
[11:33:15] <tsukasa_> wouldn't it?
[11:33:19] <taplar> why not put it outside the input at the end?
[11:33:28] <catbadger> are you trying to append the % to the result, or show it to the user?
[11:33:57] <tsukasa_> append it to the result in a way that is pleasant to the user
[11:34:08] <tsukasa_> would replacing the value work?
[11:34:09] <AwkwardCough> "[  inputField  ] %" or "[  inputField %  ]"
[11:34:31] <tsukasa_> like if i type 100 it becomes 100%
[11:34:44] <AwkwardCough> in the inputField?
[11:34:50] <tsukasa_> yeah
[11:34:55] <tsukasa_> input.value
[11:35:01] <tsukasa_> why not?
[11:35:06] <tsukasa_> it looks better
[11:35:48] <taplar> " i feel like if i set the value while the user is typing it would be weird "
[11:35:57] <taplar> is true
[11:36:13] <taplar> lots of sites put the $ in front of an input field instead of inside
[11:36:21] <taplar> % and the end is about the same
[11:36:27] <taplar> *at
[11:36:37] <catbadger> um... why not just do this: <input>%
[11:36:41] <taplar> ^
[11:36:50] <taplar> that's what i'm saying
[11:36:57] <tsukasa_> 30                              % versus 30%
[11:37:05] <taplar> so shrink the input width
[11:37:13] <catbadger> taplar is right.
[11:37:19] <tsukasa_> but they all symmetrical and pretty :(
[11:37:25] <taplar> lol
[11:37:33] * catbadger has to go fix bugs back in a bit.
[11:37:43] <catbadger> also you could put the % in front.
[11:37:58] <catbadger> <div>amount (%) <input></div>
[11:38:03] <catbadger> this is really a ux issue.
[11:38:07] <taplar> ^

[13:20:59] <z1haze> what is the most simple way to implement an image slider with minimal code, it doesnt need to be fancy, i dont want to use a plugin, etc
[13:21:12] <z1haze> i just need a next and prev button and the slide will span 100% width
[13:23:04] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i'd argue against using a carousel at all.
[13:23:18] <z1haze> i wouldnt disagree
[13:23:29] <z1haze> but can you humor me?
[13:23:44] <z1haze> Something seemingly simple i cant seem to figure out what i need to do
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> use a plugin and move on heh.
[13:24:10] <robertmaxrees> no reason to reinvent the wheel.
[13:24:15] <z1haze> for my own benefit
[13:24:17] <z1haze> of learning
[13:24:24] <z1haze> ive been out of web dev for a minute
[13:24:25] <Woet> then dont ask here and just go
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> no need to get nasty Woet heh
[13:24:48] <Woet> thats not nasty, its direct
[13:24:48] <z1haze> i dont understand your response woet, but ok
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze why learn how to build something like that?
[13:25:02] <Woet> you dont learn by asking before a single line of code is written
[13:25:05] <Woet> you just start
[13:25:14] <z1haze> ive got a lot written
[13:25:21] <z1haze> nice of you to assume.
[13:25:28] <z1haze> anyway, robertmaxrees
[13:25:53] <z1haze> i just want to understand better doing transforms and stuff
[13:25:58] <robertmaxrees> z1haze why learn to build something that a) you probably shouldn't worry about building in the first place and b) already exist in multiple forms in the world
[13:26:00] <z1haze> moving things in and out of the viewing window
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on applying that stuff to a more sensible, real-world case tbh.
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> implement a menu with dropdowns or something.
[13:53:16] <taplar> Proxy is pretty cool.  i didn't realize observers are deprecated
[14:36:50] <catbadger> I is back.
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> grats
[15:02:28] <hellyeah> does jquery get along with canvas?
[15:02:56] <robertmaxrees> not particularly well.
[15:03:18] <hellyeah> so i have to use javascript this time
[15:03:29] <robertmaxrees> *native javascript, yeah.
[15:03:39] <robertmaxrees> you've been using javascript already ;)_
[15:03:45] <hellyeah> yes
[15:03:55] <hellyeah> :D
[15:04:03] <hellyeah> i am good at that now
[15:04:09] <hellyeah> i am writing a game 2d web game
[15:05:45] <hellyeah> anywway
[15:05:46] <hellyeah> :D
[15:05:57] <hellyeah> i will write another app
[15:06:19] <hellyeah> i can use jquery there :D
[15:06:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:06:27] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[15:07:00] <hellyeah> you writin jquery mobile also right
[15:07:13] <hellyeah> can i ask about mobile version of jquery to you?
[15:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you can ask the channel
[15:08:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:08:56] <hellyeah> well you seem active now thats why i am gonna ask that question if you allow me
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:09:15] <hellyeah> :D
[15:09:18] <robertmaxrees> heh - people might be lurking.
[15:09:25] <hellyeah> you are the only fella talking
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question,  if somebody can help, they will.
[15:09:29] <hellyeah> it was just a joke :D
[15:09:35] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[15:10:31] <hellyeah> well jquery seems working most part in mobile. What should i add to my script when i use this on mobile because i heard the only thing you need in mobile device is "touch" event? is that correct?
[15:10:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:10:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean instead of click?
[15:11:45] <hellyeah> click event seems working on mobile device
[15:11:54] <hellyeah> there must be some difference i dont know actually
[15:12:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost on what you're asking heh.
[15:12:06] <hellyeah> because my program is fully compatible with mobile
[15:12:24] <hellyeah> and not jquery mobile was included
[15:12:32] <hellyeah> it is javascript and jquery
[15:12:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:12:50] <robertmaxrees> so are you having any issues or no?
[15:13:30] <hellyeah> i dont have any issues
[15:13:45] <hellyeah> okay but why mobile version of jquery exist then
[15:13:49] <hellyeah> just cariousity
[15:14:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jquerymobile.com/
[15:14:22] <robertmaxrees> see the opening lines there?
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> it'
[15:14:42] <robertmaxrees> *it's a framework that includes a bunch of different ui elements and stuff
[15:14:52] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of like jquery ui, but for mobile.
[15:15:46] <hellyeah> ah
[15:15:53] <hellyeah> okay i got it
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> it also handles some event stuff for you.
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> and some other things.
[15:17:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:18:44] <hellyeah> understand
[15:31:17] <WhirledPress> can someone explain why each div in this example is reporting the same offset position on scroll? https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/f5pw1x60/3/
[15:37:33] <WhirledPress> doh, nvm.
[16:26:14] <orbyt_> I'm debugging the following snippet: https://pastebin.com/ptx4yjWN
[16:27:13] <orbyt_> When a modal is open, if I click anywhere to close it (the "X" button, off the modal, the "cancel" button) the log statement is printed.
[16:27:53] <orbyt_> Unless i'm mistaken, $(".select-options li") only selects <li> elements that are children of elements with the .selection-options class.
[16:28:12] <orbyt_> Why is the log statement being printed with seemingly unrelated events?
[16:28:28] <taplar> somehow you are clicking an li
[16:29:13] <taplar> and if you have multiple forms on the page that are not '.hidden' then you are also binding multiple times
[16:30:05] <orbyt_> Yea, the log statement is already printed in pairs.
[16:30:10] <orbyt_> This is someone else's code, btw.
[16:30:28] <taplar> looks like you are editing in now, no?
[16:30:43] <orbyt_> Yep, simply noting that as I am aware of the quality
[16:31:32] <taplar> so you get to improve it, :)
[16:31:35] <orbyt_> I'm not sure how an <li> could possible be clicked. As I mentioned, I can click "off" the modal and it's still triggered.
[16:31:49] <orbyt_> taplar Ha, I suppose so.
[16:31:56] <taplar> is there an overlay behind the modal that you are clicking?
[16:32:13] <orbyt_> There is, it's a slightly opaque overlay
[16:32:24] <taplar> click events bubble.  so logically it would seem that the modal is a child of an li at some point
[16:33:21] <robertmaxrees> also: Array.prototype.forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll("form:not(.hidden)"), function(form) {
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> that makes me nervous.
[16:34:27] <taplar> heh, i've been there before
[16:35:13] <orbyt_> taplar I assume you mean the overlay is a child of an li at some point?
[16:35:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's what he means.
[16:35:59] <orbyt_> If so, looking at the layout in the browser's inspector, the only parents the overlay <div> has are <body> and then <html>
[16:36:03] <robertmaxrees> have you tried inspecting the overlay and seeing if it's a child of the LI?
[16:36:07] <orbyt_> ^
[16:36:25] <robertmaxrees> $(".select-options").on('click', 'li', function() {
[16:36:28] <robertmaxrees> try that instead.
[16:36:32] <robertmaxrees> and get it out ofd that forEach
[16:39:16] <orbyt_> Well, that does prevent the log statement from being printed when clicking the x or out of the modal, however it also doesn't trigger when clicking the actual items that selector is meant for.
[16:39:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:39:41] <robertmaxrees> something is shuffling the document around then.
[16:40:13] <orbyt_> Yea, the <li> items that a descendants of an element with .select-options aren't triggered with that.
[16:40:28] <orbyt_> What exactly is the 	$(".select-options").on('click', 'li', .. syntax?
[16:40:31] <robertmaxrees> which means they're getting moved after the binging is happening.
[16:40:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a delegated listener.
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function
[16:41:03] <robertmaxrees> it binds a listener to the parent and filters events from children matching that selector.
[16:42:48] <orbyt_> How is that functionally different than $('.class li').click? It seems they would both bind a listener to only children of '.class' that are <li> elements
[16:43:27] <robertmaxrees> that's the difference - $('.class li').click binds directly to elements that match that selector
[16:43:46] <taplar> *at that point in time
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> the one I provided binds only to the parent and listens for events that have bubbled up from elements matching the child selector.
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:44:03] <orbyt_> Ah, I see.
