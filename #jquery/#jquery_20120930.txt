[00:32:52] <chare> ok with rails how do I make button_to call my javascript function onclick
[00:58:31] <e66> Hello room.
[00:58:31] <e66> I have a form with some text field. How can I focus the first filed. I am using iPad.
[01:43:58] <mowol> Would it be possible to add a second parameter to this, for instance the width of the product?: http://jsfiddle.net/5aPg7/144/
[01:53:10] <r1card> guys, in Safari the appearance of Flash changes text rendering. Has anyone noticed tihs?

[02:17:53] <execat> Guys, I have a Javascript code here: http://jsfiddle.net/NJMyD/92/ I want to display the "tags" array as a separate ordered list within the ul.

[02:30:21] <FiXion> hi. I have a modal (in drupal) - click login on http://legacy.fosshosting.com - it contains two forms.
[02:31:09] <FiXion> it's using jquery once functions to ensure the form submit goes through ajax. However it only "grabs" the first forms submit. the register form (right-hand form) is not grabbed :(
[02:31:24] <FiXion> I tried changing once in the places I thought it was - to addClass..
[02:32:27] <FiXion> I was hoping someone had a second to see if they could see where the form button is "grabbed".. I thought it was modal.js line 237..
[02:46:27] <execat> Okay guys, made some progress. Still can't display the tags as an unordered list. http://jsfiddle.net/NJMyD/98/ :(
[02:47:11] <execat> Is it really that hard to traverse array elements using .each? Or are people not answering?
[02:47:19] <diverdude> How is it that i can make jquery listen on a container for a specific element to be added, and when this is added, a specific eventhandler is added to a specified event. somthing like $("#mycontainer").on('#myelement','click',function(){/*handlerstuff here*/});
[02:58:40] <noregret> if i made an ajax call, will the browser save the called URL as a referer ?
[03:04:14] <FiXion> I solved it. once worked fine - once my markup was correct (remember to wget content and view it how it looks BEFORE javascript gets run :)
[03:07:58] <automatado> so the  bind method in jquery is not the same as the standard bind?
[03:09:26] <automatado> by standard I mean function bind
[03:20:50] <ravenzz> automatado it is slightly different
[03:21:50] <ravenzz> from http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/ "Additionally, jQuery makes sure that even if you bind the function returned from jQuery.proxy() it will still unbind the correct function if passed the original."
[03:25:38] <r1card> How does one create JSON with jQuery?
[03:37:19] <NodeX> r1card : use javascript
[03:37:39] <NodeX> var myObject = {}; ... myObject.foo='bar';
[03:44:56] <r1card> NodeX, and...?
[03:45:21] <r1card> NodeX, how do I make JSON out of that.

[03:48:24] <star_prone> hi
[03:49:11] <star_prone> what does this selects jQuery('option', this);
[03:49:29] <star_prone> it selects the elements option in this?
[03:49:41] <r1card> star_prone, yeah
[03:50:05] <r1card> star_prone, basically it's like $("this option") if you could put this in a selector.
[03:51:24] <mllie> Anyone that know of a good fullscreen slider?
[03:52:05] <star_prone> r1card: thank you
[03:52:23] <star_prone> r1card: what do you mean by "if you could this in a selector"?
[03:56:14] <jrockjiggz2> what is a fullscreen slider?
[04:02:24] <r1card> star_prone "put this"
[04:02:30] <r1card> star_prone, never mind
[04:03:34] <Jee5us_w> Hi! I have a question. I have a json loop that has some page url's in it that I load via ajax and append the response content to the page. Is there any good way to get the end of json loop to create a callback function?
[04:05:02] <r1card> I append an element in IE and it doesn't effin append, argghh
[04:06:56] <sahbeewah> mowol: http://jsfiddle.net/5aPg7/149/
[04:07:56] <sahbeewah> r1card, what do you want to "make a JSON" out of?
[04:08:16] <star_prone> how can I change the selected value in a select element?
[04:09:01] <r1card> sahbeewah, a JS object.
[04:09:18] <sahbeewah> .prop('selectedIndex', ...)
[04:09:56] <sahbeewah> a JS object is basically a JSON object
[04:10:10] <sahbeewah> just remove any functions inside it
[04:10:16] <r1card> sahbeewah, no, JS object is an object, JSON is an object serialization (a piece of text)
[04:10:19] <mowol> sahbeewah: very awesome. Thanks a lot :)
[04:10:39] <sahbeewah> r1card, use JSON.stringify
[04:10:51] <r1card> sahbeewah, not available in all rbowsers, doesn't jquery have something?
[04:11:39] <sahbeewah> it isn't available in all browsers?
[04:11:51] <r1card> No it's not.
[04:13:11] <r1card> I'll use some script anyway.
[04:13:25] <r1card> the bigger question is, why do I append a <div> to the body in IE and it's nowhere to be found.
[04:13:26] <r1card> hm
[04:13:35] <r1card> Oh wait I have an idea.
[04:14:56] <r1card> the document hasn't finished loading. that's whyt
[04:15:04] <r1card> document.write works.
[04:22:49] <star_prone> how can I change the selected value in a select tag?
[05:11:05] <noregret> if an ajax call is made, will the browser save that URL as a referer ?
[05:16:37] <Dwarf> Hello
[05:16:49] <Dwarf> If I have a unordered list and click one of the list items
[05:17:09] <Dwarf> How would I go about setting that clicked listitem it's css to something like color red
[05:17:17] <Dwarf> $('.tabs li').click(function() {
[05:17:18] <Dwarf> 					$('.tabs li:clicked').get(0).css('color', 'red');
[05:17:18] <Dwarf> 				});
[05:17:21] <Dwarf> That doesn't work

[05:31:13] <coldhead> jshint might help you find it
[05:31:39] <coldhead> probably a silly typo somewhere
[05:31:42] <noregret> if an ajax call is made, will the browser save that URL as a referer ?
[05:31:42] <MisterDef> oh man i'm not good in jquery :/ it's the reason why i have buy a template

[05:34:26] <Dwarf> I don't know dabear, that confuses me even more hehe
[05:34:35] <Dwarf> I was more on about something like the last example here: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[05:34:46] <Dwarf> But then it would return me an index of list item
[05:35:13] <dabear> is you wanna compare two jquery objects, my code does that
[05:36:43] <coldhead> wish me luck, MisterDef
[05:37:00] <MisterDef> lol
[05:37:23] <coldhead> MisterDef: you have a lot of data missing from your code

[05:38:11] <Dwarf> dabear, I don't think I understand your example
[05:38:13] <coldhead> i can't resolve it for you either, i don't know what values you should have in there
[05:38:14] <MisterDef> and the suoport is too long te answer
[05:38:32] <MisterDef> yes i know :/
[05:38:37] <dabear> Dwarf: I don't understand your car
[05:39:22] <coldhead> MisterDef: maybe you can get it to work by commenting out the lines with errors?
[05:39:32] <coldhead> and pretending everything is fine?

[05:41:39] <coldhead> you probably either need to pay someone to do this for you or learn to do it yourself
[05:41:46] <coldhead> i'm so sorry

[05:43:38] <Dwarf> That will colour the first one no matter what
[06:23:53] <defaultro> hey folks, just learned how to detach and appendto html tag to a new div. Now, I would like to do the same but I would like to use my mouse to drag the object that is on #div1 to #div2. How do I write that?
[06:27:12] <Krambiorix> hi in jquery i use JSON.stringify to parse an object to a string. Then in PHP i use json_decode() to decode it. When i output the decoded value i get only this: [{       Here's some code http://pastebin.com/s2Net1t3
[06:31:39] <pachet> defaultro: have a look at how the drag and drop plugin from jquery ui does it
[06:32:05] <defaultro> yup, I am reading it now
[06:32:20] <pachet> namely, you'd probably just clone your original drag subject, set the original to visibility:none so that its original place in the dom is preserved
[06:32:31] <defaultro> cool
[06:32:36] <pachet> and then wait and see if the user selected a proper drop target
[06:32:48] <defaultro> k
[06:34:03] <Krambiorix> pachet, can you help?
[06:34:57] <defaultro> Krambiorix, maybe ajax it then use $_POST in php, done
[06:35:19] <Krambiorix> defaultro, how can i "ajax" it?
[06:35:29] <defaultro> do you know ajax?
[06:35:33] <pachet> Krambiorix: look at your request body
[06:35:45] <pachet> i'm assuming you're using POST as your req type
[06:36:27] <Krambiorix> yes POST
[06:38:22] <Krambiorix> pachet, in the request body: attendees =	[{
[06:38:48] <defaultro> don't stringify it, just retain the object then pass to $(ajax)
[06:44:35] <Krambiorix> defaultro, before the ajax request it shows the object as %5Bobject+Object%5D
[06:44:52] <defaultro> here is sample $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "process.php", data: { var1: value1, var2: value2 } }); then in php, $_POST[var1] is how you would access the data
[06:45:30] <defaultro> hmm, console.log the object
[06:45:38] <defaultro> paste it here
[06:45:48] <Krambiorix> defaultro, ATTENDEES:[object Object]
[06:45:57] <defaultro> wait, are you doing a GET from php or sending to php
[06:46:17] <Krambiorix> defaultro, sending to php
[06:46:30] <defaultro> then follow my sample code above
[06:46:47] <defaultro> but fix your object first
[06:47:10] <defaultro> that's what I asked you to console.log the object then paste it here. The source object
[06:47:52] <Krambiorix> defaultro, it puts all variables in a form first and then does: formdata = $(thisform).serialize(); . I think it's not possible to store an object in an input field....
[06:48:10] <Krambiorix> defaultro, so that's why i stringified it first
[06:53:38] <noregret> if an ajax call is made, will the browser save that URL as a referer ?
[06:59:59] <Krambiorix> defaultro, it doesnt work
[07:00:30] <Krambiorix> defaultro, in firebug i see that the string is [Object object]
[07:32:35] <callumacrae> Hello
[07:39:02] <Dwarf> How do I enumerate form data again for use with jQuery.post()
[07:39:33] <pachet> ?.serialize() @ Dwarf
[07:39:33] <bot-t> Dwarf, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:39:41] <Dwarf> Ah yes
[07:39:43] <Dwarf> That's the one!
[07:39:45] <Dwarf> thanks a lot
[07:39:48] <pachet> np
[07:41:24] <Dwarf> I'm quite confused how to use it with $.post tho
[07:41:32] <Dwarf> The example says the following:
[07:41:32] <Dwarf> $.post( url, { s: term },
[07:41:48] <Dwarf> Would I assign the contents of .serialize to a variable and put the variable there?
[07:42:08] <Dwarf> As in $.post( url, { serializedVar },
[07:42:44] <xenaxon> hi
[07:43:22] <pachet> Dwarf : it depends
[07:43:26] <xenaxon> is this correct: $(this+" li").each()
[07:43:27] <xenaxon> ?
[07:43:41] <pachet> if you have other stuff that you're wanting to include in that post request, then you can serialize the form and have it on a property there
[07:44:00] <pachet> if you don't really have anything else and you just want to send the form data, you can just pass that serialized string for that second argument
[07:44:46] <pachet> Dwarf : eg $.post('foo.url', $myForm.serialize(), function success ( ) { --> });
[07:45:03] <Dwarf> http://pastebin.com/hYFc9yXC
[07:45:08] <Dwarf> That would be correct then
[07:45:11] <Dwarf> Let's see how it works
[07:46:12] <noregret> if an ajax call is made, will the browser save that URL as a referer ?
[07:48:51] <pachet> xenanon: short answer is no
[07:48:58] <pachet> xenanon: long answer is, it could be
[07:49:21] <pachet> if 'this' was an object with a toString() property defined that returned something parsable as a selector ;[
[08:04:00] <aniasis> Hey
[08:04:43] <aniasis> I am having an issue sending a ajax request within another ajax request.

[08:10:11] <noregret> if an ajax call is made, will the browser save that URL as a referer ?
[08:12:42] <pachet> if you mean, assign the current URL for the page where the ajax request originated as the http referer header field on the outgoing ajax request, then the answer is....

[08:32:55] <Hilton> Hello! I have a list of items, currently being output in a nice "tiles" style list. What I would like is to add a dyanmic search box, so as a person types, only matching elements appear. The search would need to be looking through four different fields, however, not just one. I can't think of / find anything to help me with this.
[08:34:45] <Hilton> Any ideas?
[08:35:09] <jmar777> Hilton: if you want something semi-out-of-the-box, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/filtering.html is pretty awesome (free for personal use)
[08:36:01] <pachet> have an object whose keys are your keywords
[08:36:03] <jmar777> Hilton: otherwise it seems like all you really need is an onchange in a textbox and an "each" loop across your nodes
[08:36:30] <pachet> then the properties for those keys are arrays of references to the relevant tiles
[08:36:40] <Hilton_> wth.
[08:37:52] <pachet> var map = { 'springtime' : [$one, $two, $three], 'summertime' : [$four, $five], 'warmweather' : [$three, $four, $five] }
[08:38:17] <pachet> normally you'd also put in references to all the subsets of the keywords of a minimum length
[08:38:30] <noregret> pachet: i'm confused, can I get that URL or not ?
[08:38:39] <pachet> wea weat weath weather war warm, etc
[08:38:51] <pachet> just to increase the lookup speed
[08:39:07] <pachet> or you can wait and cache those on a per-keyword basis as you need them
[08:47:18] <ianliu> When working with jQuery sortable, how can I get a reference to the element that I've just dropped? I assume I should do this in 'update' event, right?
[08:49:00] <pachet> ianliu: well, i'd use 'stop'
[08:49:22] <pachet> but in either case you can get the sorted item via ui.item
[08:49:43] <ianliu> pachet: and how can I get a reference to the dropped element?
[08:50:03] <pachet> eg sort : function ( e, ui ) { /* do stuff with ui.item */ }
[08:51:07] <pachet> er, what do you mean by dropped element?
[08:51:24] <pachet> i understand that to be the item that you're moving around in the list, right?
[08:52:35] <ianliu> pachet: oh, sorry, didn't see your reply. Yes, it is ui.item. Thanks!

[09:09:05] <PhonicUK> is there a way in jquery to keep traversing up parents until a particular match is found?
[09:09:40] <shoky> ?closest
[09:09:40] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:09:42] <pachet> ?.closest() @ PhonickUk
[09:09:43] <bot-t> PhonickUk, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:09:48] <pachet> oh woops, shoky wins
[09:09:53] <shoky> ;p
[09:09:54] <PhonicUK> thankyou kindly
[09:10:08] <PhonicUK> just to clarify on its usage and how I'm using it:
[09:10:24] <PhonicUK> where my page is split into tabs, and each tab has an arbitary document tree
[09:11:17] <PhonicUK> if I take any element within a tab regardless of child depth and do a .closest(selector-matching-tabs) - it will effectively return the tab containing that element
[09:11:57] <pachet> yup, provided one exists
[09:12:07] <PhonicUK> fantastic
[09:12:26] <PhonicUK> i'm trying to implement something like chrome's setting search within my web app
[09:12:42] <mllie> Hello
[09:13:35] <pachet> mllie: hello
[09:14:55] <mllie> I'm using mouseenter and mouseleave, and inside there an animation in 0,3 sec. That makes a problem, when moving the mouse out and in several times the animations are going like in, out, in, out after stopped the mouse..
[09:15:50] <bika> why dont you use hover instead?
[09:16:15] <mllie> bika: how do you mean?
[09:16:34] <pachet> mllie: i actually recommend not using .hover, and using the events instead, like you are
[09:16:47] <pachet> however, in your event handlers, call .stop() on the given element before .animate()
[09:16:53] <bika> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[09:17:40] <bika> mllie: I'm just starting with jquery so i think you should listen to pachet
[09:17:47] <bika> mllie: lol
[09:18:17] <mllie> pachet: does stop work even when doing fadeTo()?
[09:18:18] <bika> pachet: whats the problem of hover?
[09:19:04] <pachet> bika: http://blog.methvin.com/2011/10/this-hover-cruft-is-full-of-ills.html
[09:19:27] <pachet> mllie: yes, because fadeTo() is ( usually ) just an abstraction wrapper for .animate()
[09:19:47] <pachet> and it adds animations to the same queue ( the jquery fx queue )
[09:20:23] <bika> pachet: thx for the link
[09:20:40] <mllie> pachet: thanks, that solved it awesomely!
[09:22:40] <mllie> pachet: well, when doing fadeTo(), what css-property does it use to set opacity in ie8? seems like opacity not working?
[09:24:18] <pachet> mllie: been a while since i've poked around in the section for that but pretty sure jquery falls back on the -ms-filter alpha proprietary instruction for that
[09:25:41] <Quix0r> my script is no longer working:http://mxchange.org/repos/mailer/branches/0.2.1-FINAL/js/ajax-common.js : on line 178 I define a function called sendAjaxRequest() which calls ajax(), on 'success' I do this: success: function (ajax_content) {
[09:25:51] <noregret> pachet: ?
[09:25:54] <Quix0r> so ajax_content is the returned data, right?
[09:26:55] <Quix0r> that I need is ajax_content.responseText
[09:27:05] <Quix0r> so how can I vardump ajax_content ?
[09:27:50] <Quix0r> PHP has print_r() for this
[09:28:16] <noregret> Quix0r: you can use console.log and see the output in firebug
[09:28:17] <pachet> Quix0r: console.log()
[09:29:02] <pachet> noregret: sorry, did i miss a message from you?
[09:29:09] <Quix0r> I have typed it, nothing happened
[09:29:31] <pachet> Quix0r: you have to view that logged result in the development console for your browser
[09:29:38] <Quix0r> ???
[09:29:41] <pachet> ff dev tools, firebug, chrome dev tools, etc
[09:30:02] <Quix0r> I have developer bar and firebug
[09:30:42] <pachet> your console.log() should show up in the firebug 'console' tab
[09:30:44] <noregret> pachet: i asked if it is possible to get that uRL or not
[09:31:00] <pachet> on the server?
[09:31:05] <Quix0r> I am there
[09:31:12] <pachet> i mean, the browser's not guaranteed to set that
[09:31:15] <pachet> and you can spoof it
[09:31:20] <noregret> hmm, i see
[09:31:26] <pachet> and some browsers don't set it on ajax requests in the first place
[09:31:35] <pachet> so its not something i'd rely on
[09:32:08] <Quix0r> :(
[09:32:11] <noregret> how much effect does it have when replacting some jquery code ?
[09:32:49] <pachet> what do you mean?
[09:32:52] <Quix0r> okay, found it
[09:32:55] <Quix0r> thanks :)
[09:33:19] <noregret> i mean i have several parts of code doing the same thing, but it wasnt feasable to put in functions..
[09:34:45] <Quix0r> so basicly, responseText is renamed to reply_content ?
[09:35:27] <Quix0r> I throw exceptions there which I hope that they can be handled somewhere
[09:36:27] <noregret> how do you manage older ajax content? meaning, after a successful ajax cal, content is added to a certain <div> and within that content there is another ajax call that will also put its content in this same div, so in order to return to the older content, i have to re-call the first ajax call, that's why i was asking for a referer. Is tehre a way to do that ? or is what i'm doing fine ? or should the UI be designed differently ?
[09:37:10] <noregret> hope that sounded clear enough
[09:38:30] <pachet> er, i'd probably not have scripts inside the html content that you're pulling
[09:38:32] <pachet> if that's what you meant
[09:38:40] <Quix0r> Use of getAttributeNodeNS() is deprecated. Use getAttributeNS() instead.<-- I got this as well
[09:39:37] <sigurding> guys, which framework would you recommend, when I would like to write a single-page application, but with business logic on the server?
[09:39:46] <noregret> pachet: what do you mean
[09:40:34] <pachet> noregret: maybe im misunderstanding you, but i took what you said to mean that you're fetching a string of markup, and in that markup there's a script tag that starts another ajax request
[09:40:46] <Quix0r> JSON.parse: unexpected character
[09:40:58] <Quix0r> this happens now, which also never happens before
[09:41:04] <noregret> pachet: ah no, not like that, it's just normal content such as anchors that are attached to events
[09:41:19] <pachet> noregret: oh nevermind then
[09:41:41] <Quix0r> http://pastie.org/4887006 <-- please take a look, that is the JSON
[09:41:44] <noregret> what should be done in my case ? is what i'm doing fine ?
[09:42:04] <pachet> sigurding: i usually just piece together what i need rather than going with an all-bases-covered solution
[09:42:24] <sigurding> pachet: means?
[09:42:47] <noregret> sigurding: you're talking an all ajax page, right ?
[09:42:53] <noregret> about *
[09:42:57] <sigurding> noregret: yep
[09:43:04] <pachet> sigurding: well, there are popular mvc-ish libs for frontend js
[09:43:15] <noregret> sigurding: actually, that's what i'm doing currently
[09:43:22] <sigurding> pachet: yes there are like backbone, ember etc.
[09:43:27] <pachet> sigurding: eg ember, knockout, angular
[09:43:29] <pachet> right
[09:44:02] <pachet> but i tend to just wrap what i need rather than relying on ^
[09:44:06] <Quix0r> jsonlint.com says valid JSON about it
[09:44:12] <pachet> usually require.js for dependencies
[09:44:22] <sigurding> but honestly I am not a big fan of having all business logic on the client side. What I would like to find is something like sammy.js but with more features
[09:44:29] <pachet> occasionally history.js for making single page apps feel more rest-ful
[09:45:07] <sigurding> for complexe b2b applications it is quite difficult to use backbone for example. as soon as I have nested objects etc. it is getting that worse, that I want to think of it
[09:45:10] <noregret> pachet: hmm, what's that history.js ? seems that's i need
[09:45:50] <pachet> its just a standardization lib for html5 history api, basically
[09:45:54] <pachet> ? history.js
[09:45:58] <bot-t> pachet, History.js: PushState for HTML5 browsers ... - jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/history-js
[09:51:35] <PhonicUK> does jquery have a built in 'scroll to element' or do i need to do .scrollTop on the document?
[09:53:33] <dabear> PhonicUK: var id= "someContainer"; $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $("#"+id).offset().top}
[09:56:54] <jmar777> i feel like i should know this, but is `fn.apply(obj, arguments);` cross browser? or do you need `fn.apply(obj, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);` ?
[09:57:57] <PhonicUK> dabear, thanks, works great
[09:59:06] <pachet> jmar777: the first is fine
[09:59:12] <jmar777> pachet: thanks
[10:13:32] <xboi209> how do i select a certain part of the page when I'm use $.get?
[10:40:20] <mllie> Hello
[10:41:36] <mllie> I've found an plugin to jquery that stores it's info as global variables, which makes it impossible to use that plugin twice on one page. How can I do to not store in globally?
[10:42:36] <EdwardIII> hrm, trying to use jQuery validate on some elements where the ids have underscores, e.g. id="id_name", can't seem to find them, i'm guessing because of the underscore?
[10:48:04] <EdwardIII> hrm i keep getting 'Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'split'
[10:49:36] <EdwardIII> here's the code: https://gist.github.com/3807908
[10:49:48] <EdwardIII> that console.log is returning 1
[10:56:09] <faraway> EdwardIII: are you sure the validation plugin uses the id and not the name attr ?
[10:56:41] <EdwardIII> faraway: tried both
[10:58:05] <faraway> EdwardIII: hmm, that was the only guess i could do, cause i don't know the plugin
[10:58:14] <EdwardIII> good call though
[11:02:18] <mllie> Anyone?
[11:03:44] <Symbi0nt|GER> what is the best solution atm to create a non blocking ajax request every X seconds?
[11:10:38] <faraway> mllie: i would guess you can't. but you should tell the plugin name so that there is a chance that anyone could help you
[11:10:59] <mllie> faraway: some way should be possible I think
[11:11:30] <mllie> faraway: this one: https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/master/build/jquery.superslides.js
[11:12:01] <mllie> If I move everything above: $.fn.superslides = function(options) { inside that one, shouldn't that work?
[11:14:34] <faraway> mllie: well the plugin does not store it as "global" variables, but it indeed does not look like it can be used twice
[11:14:59] <mllie> faraway: ok, not global maybe, but not in a way that it can be reused :)
[11:15:20] <faraway> milligan: and if that what you are trying should work ... don't knwo and i really don't have the time to look if that would work ;)
[11:15:30] <faraway> mllie:
[11:16:24] <faraway> mllie: it could work, but without looking closely at the code it is not possible to tell
[11:17:19] <rgenito> is there a quick way to remove a certain class from EVERY element on the html document?
[11:17:31] <faraway> mllie: it won't, cause $.fn.superslides.api  uses animate, and if you move all above in the $.fn.superslides = function(options) { animate is not reachable by the api anymore
[11:17:33] <rgenito> oh wait, i think i figured it out lol
[11:18:35] <mllie> faraway: I know, but I don't need the api actually
[11:19:16] <faraway> mllie: then try and check if it will work for you ;)
[11:23:39] <mllie> faraway: doesn't look like that
[11:24:20] <faraway> do oyu need to use it only twice ?
[11:24:32] <mllie> faraway: no, more than twice
[11:25:26] <faraway> mllie: then you probably need to search for another plugin, or try to fix the plugin.
[11:29:13] <mllie> faraway: do you know of anyone?
[11:32:45] <faraway> mllie: what i don't undestand is this plugin is for full screen content rotating, why do you need more then on wof these in a page
[11:37:07] <javalover> hey so I use .find("#id") to iterate forwards, how do I iterate up?
[11:37:13] <javalover> and yes I am googling it i'm just tired today
[11:37:48] <faraway> iterate up ?
[11:37:54] <javalover> do the opposite of .find
[11:38:07] <javalover> instead of searching through child elements I want to go up
[11:38:20] <faraway> closest
[11:38:28] <javalover> .closest()
[11:38:32] <javalover> yeah I just read that, ty so much
[11:52:16] <maddle> hi. is there already a jquery way of getting a input value and empty the field in one line of code?
[12:04:06] <catery> how do I make my coffeescript code into a library that multiple rails projects can use
[12:15:14] <dthree> Hi, i have a question: How can i make something like this in css: #id>#idsubitem with $( of jquery?
[12:16:03] <tlkr> $('#id').children('#idsubitem') ?
[12:16:44] <dthree> tlkr:  thanks :D
[12:19:56] <tlkr> no worrys dthree =]
[12:30:58] <noregret> i have a <tr> that has a click event, i also have a <div class=email> in that <tr>, so i want to attach a click event to .email, but when i click it, <tr>s event also fires, how can i stop that ?
[12:31:57] <Hilton> dthree: Why would you need a selector like that? #ids are singular; no matter where it is, #idsubitem would always match only one item since you can't have more than one id.
[12:32:18] <tlkr> hah, Hilton, I nee to get some sleep :o
[12:32:23] <tlkr> and noregret: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:33:04] <Hilton> dthree: You probably are thinking of something like '#container > li' or '#container > .subitem'
[12:33:56] <Hilton> tl;kr - too late, kant read?
[12:34:17] <tlkr> I was right, but also very stupid :-)
[12:34:57] <Hilton> tlkr: But wouldn't $('#id > #idsubitem') also work?
[12:36:26] <tlkr> yes
[12:36:40] <noregret> tlkr: tried that, still both events gets fired
[12:41:54] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a variable # of images (between 1 and, say, 10), and I'd like to align them in rows, no more than 3 to a row. I can think of a few painfully complicated ways to do this...anyone know a good/sleek way?
[12:49:09] <arielserafini> ?demo @ timwis
[12:49:09] <bot-t> timwis, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:08:33] <hazamonzo> folks if i have something like this ... $(this).append("<div></div>"); How might i go about selecting that new div? I was thinking something like $(this > ....?)
[13:09:50] <Clex> hazamonzo: var div = $("<div></div>"); $(this).append(div); div.text("foo");
[13:12:06] <hazamonzo> Clex: ahhh
[13:12:25] <chare> char c1 = (char) ('a' + j1)
[13:12:29] <chare> how do i do that in javascript
[13:14:04] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a string with all names , separated by a comma. Now of all those names i want to remove one (by string) ... How can i do that in JQuery?
[13:17:26] <dabear> chare: most probably you're looking for fromCharCode and friends, see ?mdc string.fromcharcode
[13:17:29] <bot-t> chare, fromCharCode | MDN - Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode values. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[13:19:24] <dabear> ?eval String.fromCharCode("a".charCodeAt(0)+1) @ chare
[13:19:26] <bot-t> chare: "b"
[13:20:02] <Eviltwin> But it's important to recognize that JavaScript uses the Unicode character set, not the ASCII one
[13:20:50] <Eviltwin> ?eval "\u0100".charCodeAt(0)
[13:20:51] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 256
[13:21:17] <Krambiorix> anyone?
[13:21:33] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[13:21:34] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[13:21:49] <Eviltwin> ?eval "hello,these,are,my,words".split(",")
[13:21:50] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ["hello", "these", "are", "my", "words"]
[13:22:07] <Eviltwin> ?eval a=[1,2,4,8,16];a.splice(3,1);a
[13:22:08] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [1, 2, 4, 16]
[13:22:24] <Eviltwin> ?eval ["hello","there","how","are","you"].join(",")
[13:22:25] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "hello,there,how,are,you"
[13:22:38] <Eviltwin> Krambiorix: You should be able to figure it out from those pieces
[13:26:22] <Krambiorix> Eviltwin, ow nice, i like puzzles
[13:28:30] <Krambiorix> Eviltwin, i just don't know why you used splice... I don't know the position of the name in the string
[13:30:12] <Eviltwin> Oh, then you can loop and find it or $.grep it out
[13:30:19] <Eviltwin> see ?$.grep
[13:30:20] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery.grep() - Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[13:33:34] <Krambiorix> ok great, thx Eviltwin , your other twin must be an angel
[14:01:39] <dthree> other question :p if i have for example <li id="bla"><a href="#" onclick="test()"....></a></li>, how can i get id of parent li? (in this case bla), i try with parent() but i cant make it work.
[14:02:40] <dthree> i think that the function must be: test(this), and latter apply the function parent to 'this'
[14:03:32] <dthree> tlkr: any idea?
[14:07:41] <tlkr> dthree: you could pass 'this' as the parameter to test, .parent() should then work.
[14:08:35] <dthree> omg the problem is that i use partens instead parent :O
[14:10:21] <moijk> lol, you know todays world parents are usually in singular ;)
[14:14:45] <hazamonzo> hmm, hey folks. How might i get the width of a div under the stop fucntion for .resizable() ?
[14:14:58] <hazamonzo> i've tried a couple of things with no luck so far
[14:15:54] <Hilton> hazamonzo: Use a magnifying glass and count the pixels. Remember to only count the red ones.
[14:16:01] <hazamonzo> Hilton: :)
[14:17:01] <Hilton> Careful to do it quickly, though. The radiation that damages your eyes gets magnified by the magnifying glass.
[14:18:18] <hazamonzo> Hilton: Noted

[14:51:13] <Nurbs> Hi! I've got some code similar to $('ul li').hover(...). For some reason the mouseenter/mouseleave calls are only called when entering a contained <a> tag in Internet Explorer. I've tried wrappers ($('ul li .wrapper')) and different positioning methods, but the hover always only reacts to the link being entered. Why?
[14:52:22] <Nurbs> To be exact, not even entering the <a>'s padding is sufficient, the mouse needs to enter the text contained within the <a>.
[15:01:19] <Nurbs> I hate this browser. It's always that browser.

[15:59:33] <webBuilder> okay friends I have a jcarousel, a carusousl that uses jQuery library for images. the problem is every time I do quotes it's keeping not changing some to quotes some to &quot; here is the actual output from firebug jQuery("#musicCarouse").append("<p>Test</p>&quot;));
[15:59:39] <webBuilder> any help please
[15:59:56] <macmartine> Is this better/faster then document.write? https://gist.github.com/3808665
[16:02:19] <defaultro> hey guys, imagine you are looking at a rubik's cube but just one side. It has 9 squares, made from 24 lines. I want each lines to be on a single <div>. How would you write it?
[16:02:21] <SSFly> macmartine: document.write executes where encountered, it cannot inject at a given node point.
[16:04:38] <SSFly> webBuilder: jQuery("#musicCarouse").append("<p>Test</p>&quot;");
[16:05:42] <webBuilder> SSFly, I have coded jQuery("#musicCarouse").append("<p>Test</p>"); but when I view the source it shows like jQuery("#musicCarouse").append("<p>Test</p>&quot;")
[16:06:20] <webBuilder> SSFly, and obviously is not working error log said that quote is incorrect
[16:06:47] <SSFly> webBuilder, can you put the code block into jsfiddle?
[16:07:06] <webBuilder> ssfly I have no idea what is jsfiddle
[16:07:20] <SSFly> webBuilder http://jsfiddle.net/
[16:07:40] <webBuilder> SSFly, thank you, for the hint I'll read it
[16:07:52] <webBuilder> oh got it
[16:07:54] <webBuilder> I did that
[16:07:56] <webBuilder> it works
[16:08:02] <webBuilder> only on my code does not work
[16:08:51] <SSFly> webBuilder can you link me to your code on jsfiddle?
[16:09:54] <webBuilder> SSFly, now is not working
[16:09:57] <webBuilder> sure I'll do it right now
[16:10:18] <SSFly> thx
[16:10:20] <webBuilder> http://jsfiddle.net/FRxg6/
[16:17:04] <SSFly> webBuilder, I've updated your fiddle. The code was sound, just had to include the jQuery library from the left. Swapped double-quotes with single-quotes.
[16:20:21] <webBuilder> where is the link SSFly
[16:22:26] <plasticSturgeon> knock knock
[16:23:30] <shoky> who is it?????
[16:23:58] <SSFly> webBuilder my apologies, http://jsfiddle.net/FRxg6/2/
[16:25:44] <plasticSturgeon> is this still the go-to jQuery discussion as recommended by Remy Sharp?
[16:25:53] <jedimind> this room?
[16:25:59] <plasticSturgeon> yeah
[16:26:04] <jedimind> im not sure what the Remy Sharp-esque recommendation is
[16:26:10] <jedimind> but this is THE jQuery hangout in the world
[16:26:17] <plasticSturgeon> thanks!
[16:27:03] <SSFly> which is good, because i need some help... it seems jquery can't find an element that i created!
[16:27:06] <SSFly> http://jsbin.com/welcome/28801/edit
[16:28:06] <jedimind> you probably shouldnt name your var "id"
[16:28:32] <rmurphey> SSFly: also you need to provide a target to $.extend
[16:28:52] <rmurphey> ?extend
[16:28:53] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[16:29:31] <rmurphey> or, i guess not, jquery assumes jQuery if no target is provided
[16:29:40] <rmurphey> which is unnecessary magic imho, but
[16:29:56] <SSFly> When .extend() receives a single object, it adds the methods defined in it to either the jQuery or the jQuery.fn (also called jQuery.prototype and $.fn) objects.
[16:30:14] <rmurphey> yes, i read it already
[16:30:17] <rmurphey> unnecessary magic
[16:30:18] <rmurphey> but yes
[16:30:22] <SSFly> lol
[16:30:40] <SSFly> sorry didn't see your message above :P
[16:32:30] <SSFly> no idea why jquery can't see the object, tho?
[16:32:46] <rmurphey> why are you building an id like this?
[16:32:57] <rmurphey> also what object can't jquery see, what are steps to repeat, etc?
[16:33:39] <SSFly> even tried $('body').find(id), and no results were returned
[16:34:18] <SSFly> the id is dynamic based on the input sound file, can't very well use the whole uri for the file as the id, so i cut out the file name
[16:34:22] <rmurphey> SSFly: the element you're adding has an id of '#foo'
[16:34:29] <rmurphey> rather than 'foo'
[16:34:47] <rmurphey> so when you query the document for '#foo' it is looking for an element with an id of 'foo'
[16:34:52] <rmurphey> not '#foo'
[16:35:00] <rmurphey> ditch the '#' when you create the element
[16:35:08] <rmurphey> only include the '#' for querying
[16:36:07] <SSFly> haha! that's it!
[16:36:08] <rmurphey> but the fact that you're dynamically generating ID's is ... probably not a good idea in the first place :/
[16:36:10] <SSFly> silly me....
[16:36:48] <SSFly> what's wrong with it?
[16:37:35] <rmurphey> SSFly: it's not necessarily not a good idea, but in my experience it is not a good design choice
[16:37:47] <rmurphey> but i don't know enough about what you're actually trying to do to tell you what you should do instead
[16:37:59] <rmurphey> just, generally, id's are not the right place to store data
[16:38:06] <beachandbytes> I often generate Id's when cloning
[16:39:02] <rmurphey> the fact that you're cloning an element with an id, when id's are supposed to be unique per page, suggests something may be amiss :) but yes, you must change the id of an element when you clone it if you intend to add the clone to the page
[16:39:17] <SSFly> that whole block is to prevent cloning
[16:39:22] <SSFly> it tries to reuse it if it exists
[17:08:35] <sunbeam> for .mceLayout (tinymce) there is height: 397px set
[17:08:39] <sunbeam> any idea how I can change this?
[17:12:45] <_zoggy_> .mceLayout { height: auto; }
[17:13:10] <SSFly> sunbeam if the height isn't changed by javascript, but defined at a point after you define it, place the !important flag after you define it. so .mceLayout { height: 150px !important; }
[17:17:31] <sunbeam> i already tried
[17:17:33] <sunbeam> its tinymce
[17:17:34] <sunbeam> that does this
[17:17:44] <sunbeam> its set inline
[17:17:46] <sunbeam> by tinymce
[17:25:52] <itatitat> ey guys, I know this is not the channel, but really I need to know something about thit. Im thinking to learn ember.js, but I dont know if that work with jquery, or is completely different
[17:47:16] <webBuilder> SSFly, thank you so much I was a way
[17:47:18] <webBuilder> for your help
[17:47:37] <SSFly> webBuilder no problem, did you get it working?
[17:48:05] <webBuilder> not yet I'm exprimenting is not working at all it's interacting badly with all other jQuery stuff unfortunately
[17:48:17] <webBuilder> but you gave me good hint so I'll look into it starting right now
[17:48:30] <SSFly> ah that's shame, best of luck though!
[17:48:39] <webBuilder> SSFly, thank you so much
[18:11:52] <musetux> Greetings All, Hoping for a little guidance. with a little issue, which is most likely due my lack of javascript knowledge: I'm trying to use .get() to retrieve info from a page and store it in a cookie via jquery.cookie so I can quickly redisplay the info without a second db call. I can alert the data, but for some reason I can't store it? here is my code http://pastie.org/4888796 Thanks in advance for any assistance!
[18:18:37] <rmurphey> musetux: the cookie hasn't been set yet when you are trying to alert it
[18:18:40] <rmurphey> $.get is async

[19:08:56] <retro|cz> Hello. Is there any library to show my JSON as tree? I'm logging some JSON api and I want some nice folded tree view in administration.
[19:09:26] <retro|cz> I can't find any library for pure json. They all need some special JSON formatting.
[19:15:50] <pensive612> Hey shoky, you around?
[19:32:49] <aeos> Hi, for the datepicker ui I am trying to use the onSelect option, by just add an alert. When I select a date nothing appears. I am using datepicker inline
[19:33:16] <aeos> am I using the right event? where something is triggered when a date is selected?
[19:35:59] <shoky> hey pensive612
[19:37:15] <shoky> retro|cz: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fPRXJ/   i'm not sure but i think EvilTwin made/posted that
[19:37:48] <retro|cz> shoky, that's exactly I need
[19:37:55] <retro|cz> shoky, do you know license?
[19:37:56] <shoky> great ;]
[19:38:14] <shoky> i doubt you need to worry about that..
[19:38:23] <shoky> but no, i don't know
[19:38:38] <retro|cz> Eviltwin, ping
[19:39:40] <Eviltwin> I didn't put any license on it
[19:39:46] <Eviltwin> If you need it you can use it but I offer no warranty
[19:39:55] <Eviltwin> If something's not working, I won't fix it
[19:39:55] <CodesStuff> I have a feeling you guys spend more time helping people than doing your own work :P
[19:40:06] <Eviltwin> CodesStuff: Definitely did for a while
[19:41:21] <pensive612> Hey shoky, just wanted to say thanks again for the help last night.  Got the plugin up and passing.
[19:41:30] <pensive612> https://github.com/pensive612/Adamin-Clone
[19:42:09] <shoky> np, glad to help
[19:42:40] <CodesStuff> Da hel is Adamin
[19:42:42] <CodesStuff> hell
[19:42:59] <shoky> pensive612: heard of zen coding?
[19:43:01] <pensive612> nothing.  just a name i never got around to dropping...
[19:43:12] <pensive612> yeah, i use it all the time.
[19:43:17] <shoky> cool
[19:43:18] <CodesStuff> Zen is nice. The sublime plugin is better than notepad++
[19:43:32] <CodesStuff> It actually completes the tags fully
[19:43:45] <shoky> <3 webstorm <3 has it enabled by default
[19:43:56] <pensive612> yeah, i like it a lot.  but for me, this way i get to hand over really small html files.
[19:44:07] <pensive612> and its easier to read the layouts.
[19:44:09] <shoky> i was literally searching for 30 min on how to enable zen in webstorm
[19:44:16] <shoky> till i realized it just works
[19:44:17] <CodesStuff> Eh, I like lightweight editors :P
[19:44:23] <pensive612> ha.  i use it in sublime...
[19:44:34] <CodesStuff> Sublime is almost too clunky for me
[19:44:39] <pensive612> took a minute to get setup, but works nice.  for me.
[19:44:39] <CodesStuff> Notepad++ is juuuust right
[19:44:43] <shoky> i switch between gedit and webstorm ;]
[19:44:49] <CodesStuff> Heretic!
[19:44:56] * CodesStuff lights the pitchforks
[19:45:00] <pensive612> haha...
[19:45:10] <shoky> and on windows mostly textpad
[19:45:17] <CodesStuff> Ever mess with gvim?
[19:45:22] <tete> geany!!
[19:45:27] <shoky> geany's nice too
[19:45:35] <pensive612> to each his own...  but i'm just happy to be able to use this for mocking.
[19:45:41] <shoky> i couldn't handle vim for more than a day ;]
[19:45:55] <pensive612> yeah, you gotta hate it for about 2 weeks before you start liking it.
[19:46:04] <bbtb1982> amen to that
[19:46:36] <bbtb1982> its bad mamjama but you got to hate though the pain!
[19:47:08] <shoky> been trying to get into emacs
[19:47:15] <CodesStuff> God, that episode of Dexter was sick
[19:47:17] <shoky> cause im getting into clojure
[19:47:53] <shoky> doubt i'll try vim again
[19:49:01] <pensive612> i gotta jump.  thanks again.  talk to you guys later...

[19:49:57] <aeos> hi, is there any reason why the onSelect event does not fire for datepicker?
[19:50:33] <retro|cz> Eviltwin, ok, thanks
[19:50:46] <retro|cz> Eviltwin, do you have any idea about some new IE support for this?
[19:50:52] <retro|cz> I have no IE around right now.
[19:51:27] <tete> aeos: i had same problem, solved it with onClose and reading the variable
[19:51:42] <Eviltwin> retro|cz: Nope, no idea
[19:54:07] <aeos> thx tete I will try that
[19:56:22] <GoSox> Is there a way I can make a div with jquery, and have that div sit around for a few seconds, then 'self-destruct'?
[19:56:59] <Eviltwin> var mydiv = $("<div>"); mydiv.appendTo("body"); setTimeout(function() { mydiv.remove(); }, 5000);
[19:57:03] <shoky> GoSox: var div = $('<div>').appendTo('body'); setTimeout(function() { div.remove() });
[19:57:07] <shoky> lolz
[19:57:35] <GoSox> hmm looks easy enough
[20:04:56] <FireStorms> How could I modify the following to pass a value of '1' to the PHP script please <a href="javascript:$('#star-rating').submit();">*</a>
[20:05:20] <FireStorms> The documentation confuses me as I'm just starting out
[20:05:39] <GoSox> if you want to pass a js value to php, you need to have js hit a php doc with a request and usually stick the value in as a GET variable
[20:07:08] <FireStorms> I'm tryingt o recreate this <button type="submit" value="1">*</button> through POST but instead using a hyperlnk
[20:07:48] <shoky> what does value on the submit button send?
[20:08:34] <FireStorms> shoky justa  value of 1 int/string doesn't matter
[20:09:01] <FireStorms> i'd just like to know how to sent it
[20:11:40] <shoky> FireStorms: your form needs to have an input (or maybe a submit button as you say, donno) with the value 1..
[20:11:42] <Navetz> can someone help me figure out why my description element isn't hiding. After my mouseleave function i want the description hidden but the selector doesn't seem to work: http://jsfiddle.net/zrdjG/15/
[20:14:02] <shoky> Navetz: elem.children(...) will only get direct children of elem
[20:14:22] <shoky> Navetz: try .find instead
[20:15:51] <Navetz> shoky, that worked thanks!
[20:15:59] <Navetz> am I able to use a bounce effect with animate?
[20:18:18] <shoky> Navetz: you can try the jquery easing plugin (or if youre using jquery UI you'll have the easings included)
[20:18:33] <shoky> then you can try different easings with .animate
[20:18:42] <shoky> ?easing
[20:18:43] <bot-t> shoky, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:18:53] <shoky> ?g jquery easing plugin
[20:18:53] <bot-t> shoky, jQuery Easing Plugin - http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[20:18:56] <Navetz> thanks for the tips!
[20:57:10] <Gecko_> hello
[20:57:21] <Gecko_> anybody online?
[20:57:58] <Gecko_> I need some help with printing a pdf in an iframe using javascript in html..
[21:06:10] <GoSox> can i simulate events with jquery? Like if i have an event handlers for a click on an item, can I use another item to initiate a click
[21:06:19] <GoSox> so it would kind of be a short cut
[21:06:39] <arielserafini> GoSox: yes
[21:07:00] <arielserafini> GoSox: $(".myItem").click() will fire a click event
[21:07:08] <GoSox> oh cool
[21:07:08] <GoSox> thanks
[21:11:32] <bcardarella> How do I call a jquery function on an element when it is dynamically introduced to the DOM?
[21:12:05] <bcardarella> And I don't have direct control over when it is introduced
[21:12:43] <BalmTiger> hello is anybody alive so I can ask a simple jquery question?
[21:16:19] <GoSox> everybody has been murrrrdeeerrrrrred
[21:16:27] <BalmTiger> ya man..
[21:16:33] <BalmTiger> every chatroom I went to
[21:16:35] <BalmTiger> plagued
[21:47:08] <Whirl3d> good evening all
[21:56:09] <BalmTiger> hello
[21:58:27] <Whirl3d> omg, BalmTiger, I swear it's you. People hae been chatting all night, but as soon as you show up, everyone is supposed to lee for an hour and return.
[21:58:54] <BalmTiger> 0.0
[21:59:32] <BalmTiger> so you're shoo'ing the only person you can talk to here right now
[21:59:34] <BalmTiger> haha
[22:06:46] <Whirl3d> Actually, my fingers just started cramping. What is up with that?
[22:06:56] <Whirl3d> What's your question?
[22:11:45] <BalmTiger> like, I want to print a pdf in an iframe
[22:12:02] <BalmTiger> everybody says use $('pdf_iframe_id').print();
[22:12:18] <BalmTiger> browsers just throws "no such function: print();" at me
[22:12:20] <BalmTiger> = =
[22:17:07] <noregret> i have a <tr> that has a click event, i also have a <div class=email> in that <tr>, so i want to attach a click event to .email, but when i click it, <tr>s event also fires, how can i stop that ? i tried with stopPropagation, but still both event got fired, any ideas?
[22:20:55] <BalmTiger> try using id?
[22:22:54] <noregret> BalmTiger: instead of class you mean?
[22:23:04] <BalmTiger> ya
[22:23:10] <BalmTiger> maybe it won't make a difference.. lol
[22:23:31] <Whirl3d> BalmTiger, let me ask you the simple questions: Did you reference the item correctly (in otherwords #item or .item)?
[22:23:44] <BalmTiger> you can check which element of the tr is clicked right?
[22:24:22] <BalmTiger> Whirl3d, I tried both and didn't work.
[22:24:40] <noregret> BalmTiger: https://pastee.org/3k45n
[22:24:42] <noregret> that's what i mean
[22:24:56] <noregret> both this event and the <tr>'s click run
[22:25:39] <BalmTiger> why did you include .emailIcon when you want it to be separated?
[22:26:07] <noregret> seperated from what ? .emailIcon is the element that i want to click...
[22:26:37] <BalmTiger> ya.. why do you write "tr .emailIcon"
[22:27:02] <noregret> it won't matter, you can remove the "tr", i was just testing
[22:27:02] <BalmTiger> is this the function that you want or don't want to be fired
[22:27:11] <noregret> i want it to be fired
[22:27:36] <noregret> it is getting fired, but another one is also fireing with it (which is 'tr' click event)
[22:29:29] <Whirl3d> noregret, rather than select a tr.emailIcon by binding "on" to the body, you can just checke the event.target attribute to determine.
[22:29:59] <noregret> Whirl3d: you lost me, can you give more details please :)
[22:30:09] <noregret> https://pastee.org/vq8qf that's what i'm takling about
[22:31:03] <Whirl3d> $("table').on("click", function (e) {var elm=$(e.target); if (elem.is($("tr.emailIcon")) { do stuff();})  and some combination of }) til closed
[22:31:32] <Antera> hello
[22:32:15] <Antera> any idea why i have a display bug with the ui-datepicker here please ? http://demo.timeartcreation.com/orchid/spip.php?article1
[22:34:31] <Whirl3d> Antera, in your css for the popup element that hodls the calendar and make sure it has a background-color
[22:37:17] <noregret> Whirl3d: i get yur point, but why didn't it work using the first method ? because actually, i've tried that method on checkboxes and anchors, and it worked fine
[22:37:39] <noregret> only didn't work out on this .emailicon
[22:41:49] <gggg> Hello
[22:43:55] <noregret> Whirl3d: still, both events are getting fired... not sure why
[22:44:14] <GoSox> can i use an animation style with appendTo(), or do i just have to append an invisible item and then animate it into visability?
[22:45:20] <Whirl3d> No regret, that;'s why you use the conditional AFTER the event.
[22:45:40] <Whirl3d> If the table is clicked, check the target. It's it's what you want do something.(if it's not, ignore it)
[22:46:44] <Whirl3d> no regret. It is possible that you need to manage zIndeces more literally to get it to reliably work?
[22:47:38] <noregret> Whirl3d: not sure, you tell me, should i ?
[22:47:55] <Whirl3d> GoSox, you could animate the containing element and appendTo it?
[22:49:44] <Whirl3d> noregret, I don't think that it is necessarily a good thing to rely on zIndex when you can more reliably handle itanother way.
[22:50:25] <noregret> Whirl3d: so you're saying i should handle both events by mathing them from the target ?
[22:51:18] <Whirl3d> You should handle the event that you want. Do you need to do something when the tr is clicked? handle it using the event.target check for ("tr")
[22:51:27] <noregret> Whirl3d: https://pastee.org/4yb3d because this isn't working out, 'tst' is printed but 'email' isn't.. even though i'm clicking on that .emailIcon
[22:52:14] <noregret> so it looks like it is not matching the selector
[22:52:30] <Whirl3d> noregret. I cannot suggest enough that you use jsfiddle. I need to see the table's html before I can reliably predict your answer
[22:54:16] <GoSox> anyone else think that the web inspector in Safari 6 is a terrible huge step backwards from the old web inspector?
[22:54:27] <noregret> alright then
[22:55:24] <shalotelli> why even waste time with it when theres firebug
[22:55:24] <phiz> how can you print what a GET variable is set to w/ jquery
[22:55:48] <Whirl3d> noregret, here's a start: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/sBmLe/
[23:03:18] <noregret> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/MnFve/ that's what i currently have
[23:04:16] <noregret> Whirl3d: you see i was using stoPropagation for other elements, and it was working fine
[23:04:53] <noregret> except this emailIcon ..
[23:09:22] <GoSox> i have an .each() loop inside of a function. I read that I can return false to exit out of the each() loop, how can I exit out of the loop and then right out of the function too?
[23:13:19] <Whirl3d> no regret. No need to stop propagation, just don't handle the rowclick event
[23:15:11] <noregret> Whirl3d: nevermind, i got it working :)
[23:15:15] <Whirl3d> noregret, also, you don't have an email element because you haven't included your css
[23:18:31] <noregret> I have <td><div item></div></td> how can I add another <td> from the item selector ?is it something like item.parent().appendT(<td></td>) ?
[23:19:09] <Whirl3d> you might want to use .after or .before
[23:22:27] <noregret> how can i make sure that only one is added and not more after several calls
[23:23:15] <noregret> do i have to check for its existence before inserting it? or is there a faster way for that
[23:23:19] <Whirl3d> Not sure how you add one?
[23:23:51] <noregret> Whirl3d: i mean if that is called several times, X number of <td>s will be added, while i only need one to be added
[23:24:32] <Whirl3d> When does it know to add one?
[23:24:48] <noregret> say again
[23:25:13] <Whirl3d> you say you want to add a td? When? Why? What events happen that trigger this addition?
[23:25:33] <noregret> Whirl3d: a click on an element
[23:25:49] <noregret> when a certain element is cicked, that td is added
[23:26:08] <noregret> actually, that element is the 'item' from before
[23:26:24] <noregret> so i have it like that: $(this).parent().after('<td></td>');
[23:27:12] <Whirl3d> That will append to the grandparent, right after the parent.
[23:27:45] <noregret> yeah,
[23:27:55] <noregret> because 'item' is in a td, i want another td
[23:27:56] <Whirl3d> Whereas $(this).after("<td/>"); will append it to the table as the next element
[23:28:36] <Whirl3d> $("<td/>").after($(this).closest("td"));
[23:30:00] <stan_man_can> if i use $.parseJSON will it re-order the json bsed on the key value?
[23:30:57] <stan_man_can> I'm taking a php array, sorting it how I want it, json encode, send to the browser, and then doing a parseJSON and looping through it but th js side keeps correcting the order
[23:38:44] <Whirl3d> stan_man_can, I believe that if you return a JSON encoded PHP Array, you don't have a key-index
[23:51:34] <onats> hi guys, I'm having problems in IE9 when my response is application/json, it asks the browser to download. is this expected/
[23:52:09] <sigurding> then your response content type is invalid
[23:54:41] <onats> sigurding: i set it at application/json
[23:54:43] <GoSox> if you need to check your http response headers, you can use this

[23:55:14] <sigurding> onats: in other browsers it works?
[23:55:24] <onats> sigurding: yes.. chrome/ ff/ safari.
[23:55:36] <onats> GoSox: i check the response headers using IE9 developer tools
[23:55:37] <GoSox> what about in netscape?

[23:55:48] <onats> GoSox: haven't tested. i think thats no longer supported

[23:57:27] <onats> oops sorry
[23:57:40] <sigurding> as you can see it is not application/json my friend
[23:57:43] <onats> i change that to text/javascript or application/json, its the same
[23:57:52] <onats> sorry i was trying to follow a suggestion in stackoverflow
[23:58:35] <sigurding> try it again with application/json and use pastie for the next output
[23:58:40] <onats> its the same behaviour. and when i do text/json, i get something like it switches to quirks mode
[23:58:42] <onats> ok hold on
