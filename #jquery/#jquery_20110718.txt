[00:01:32] <gnrlbzik> whos up?
[00:01:47] <juha___> that guy there --->
[00:05:01] <gnrlbzik> alright, here it goes again
[00:05:14] <gnrlbzik> i need to scroll item into view
[00:05:27] <gnrlbzik> within container that has scroll bar
[00:06:11] <gnrlbzik> i need to find out position of the element that i want to scroll into view so that i can pass it to scrollTop()
[00:17:21] <luite> how can I use a non-standard icon in my buttons? i.e. an icon not from the standard icons file.
[00:23:22] <Muimi> Is there anything in jquery that would cause a class selector rule to not act on a specific div instance of a class?
[00:23:31] <Muimi> Like you have: <div id="show-more" class="hidden"><a href="#1"></a></div><div id="show-less" class="hidden"><a href="#2"></a></div>, but in the inspector, it shows that the matching css rule for the sooner is not .hidden{display:none}, and the latter is .hidden{display:none} until #1 is clicked.  Then, both have the matching rule?
[00:29:43] <Guest94666> Muimi: you can't select on css values
[00:30:48] <SomeRandom> Muimi, the only thing I could think of is that the element is hidden prior to running your code.
[00:31:09] <SomeRandom> Had problems before with hidden input elements.
[00:31:16] <Mrfloyd> i am trying to use .focus() on a textarea and the keybord is not poping in the ios webview any idea?
[00:31:30] <SomeRandom> Had to make sure I was directly calling hidden elements.
[00:31:36] <SomeRandom> selecting*
[00:32:17] <SomeRandom> `help
[00:34:17] <Muimi> SomeRandom: The 'hidden' rule is stricken out
[00:34:28] <Muimi> and when I disable it in the inspector, the content disappears.
[00:34:46] <Muimi> and the div moves above another div X//
[00:34:54] <SomeRandom> Get some code online.
[00:36:28] <Muimi> alright
[00:36:41] <Muimi> i'll see what I can do.  I have to take it out of context.  I should have been modularizing better. :/
[00:40:34] <molavy> egillth:there is another prolem about your code  in :http://jsfiddle.net/y526V/
[00:41:52] <molavy> every time i click in "clickme",i don't fadein completely
[00:43:15] <molavy> please click on it when it go fadeout and see what happen
[00:46:43] <luite> oh found it, have to use !important to override the background url
[00:47:42] <Shazer2> omfg.
[00:47:48] <Shazer2> why. won't. this. god. damn. div. display
[00:47:49] <Shazer2> god damn
[00:48:38] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:57:30] <Shazer2> whyyyyyy
[00:57:33] <Shazer2> would this not work
[00:57:33] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9482
[00:57:37] <Shazer2> the div doesn't work..
[00:58:07] <bgy> hello
[00:59:07] <Anticom> good morning all (:
[00:59:46] <Anticom> Shazer2 what div?
[01:00:00] <Anticom> paste the generated html code
[01:00:26] <Anticom> a script with php in it is silly to paste, especially if there is some DB-stuff in it
[01:02:13] <Shazer2> Anticom
[01:03:12] <Shazer2> <div id="successMessage"></div>
[01:03:53] <Anticom> Shazer2 there's no js in that paste...
[01:04:04] <Anticom> so there is nothing, that should work i suppose
[01:04:16] <Shazer2> Anticom
[01:04:17] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9483
[01:04:26] <Anticom> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html ;)
[01:07:09] <Anticom> Shazer2 put your code in a $(document).ready(function() {....}); block first
[01:07:16] <Anticom> since you want to manipulate the dom
[01:07:56] <Anticom> and use firebug etc or even better jslint to make sure, there is no syntax error
[01:07:59] <Anticom> because there is one
[01:08:23] <Anticom> http://www.pasteall.org/23294
[01:11:21] <Shazer2> it isn't missing a semicolon?
[01:11:59] <Gorkyman> hey guys I need a bit of a help... i'm showing a popup via fancybox, but I want to have a form in that popup  that would be on its own
[01:12:17] <Gorkyman> problem is, when I use ajax form post on submit it gets submitted twice
[01:12:33] <Gorkyman> probably once in my ajax call and oncefor fancybox ajax
[01:12:36] <Anticom> Shazer2 but your function got to be in " "'s
[01:12:45] <Gorkyman> any good advice how to handle that ?
[01:13:22] <Shazer2> what Anticom?
[01:13:44] <Anticom> Shazer2 google "javascript setTimeout()"
[01:14:03] <markj2> ?mdc setimeout @ Shazer2
[01:14:03] <bot-t> Shazer2, window.setTimeout - MDN Docs - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[01:14:17] <dr0id> Gorkyman: then just submit one of them
[01:14:32] <Anticom> Gorkyman have you simply tried getting the call stack via firebug etc?
[01:15:23] <Gorkyman> well seems like my own ajax call is fired twice
[01:15:26] <Gorkyman> I haven o idea why
[01:15:55] <Anticom> paste code then ;)
[01:16:48] <Procu> morning
[01:17:08] <Anticom> Procu good morning
[01:17:59] <Muimi> Is single-underbar reserved for anything in jquery?
[01:18:14] <Muimi> _function
[01:18:58] <Anticom> Muimi why don't you use the force of google to answer that question? _(:
[01:19:40] <DarsVaeda1> some admin on?
[01:19:54] <DarsVaeda1> pls ban evaa, is spamming porn links
[01:20:26] <Gorkyman> Anticom: http://pastebin.com/Qm3R6X64
[01:20:31] <Gorkyman> it is posted twice
[01:20:57] <ablomen> Gorkyman, you have put it in document.ready twice
[01:21:08] <ablomen> jQuery(function($) { === $(document).ready(function() {
[01:24:18] <Gorkyman> ohh
[01:24:21] <Gorkyman> didnt know that
[01:24:22] <Gorkyman> thanks
[01:25:03] <Gorkyman> ablomen: its still called twice
[01:25:07] <Gorkyman> *submited
[01:25:15] <aaairc> hello all
[01:25:26] <Shazer2> redirect works Anticom
[01:26:41] <ablomen> Gorkyman, $("login-form") << your selector is wrong too btw, should be $("#login-form")
[01:29:13] <aaairc> Im measuring the width of the window within the $document.ready()... and using that window width to set the width of a div. The issue I'm having though, is that when it reads the window width, the scrollbar hasn't loaded yet... so the width it gives me keeps being 15pixels off for initial page load
[01:29:45] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, you should use css to size things
[01:29:52] <blackspotwiggins> not js hacks
[01:30:00] <danieliser> trying to serialize a form into a variable during a function and it comes back empty in log
[01:30:45] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: hmm i think i have to use js to accomplish the effect that i'm going for.
[01:31:18] <blackspotwiggins> width of the document is hardly one of those cases where you need js
[01:31:53] <Gorkyman> ablomen: still gets posted twice :/
[01:32:09] <dr0id> what's the code ?
[01:32:49] <Anticom> Gorkyman what's that? #
[01:32:49] <Anticom>                 jQuery(function($) {
[01:32:49] <Anticom> #
[01:32:49] <Anticom>                         $(document).ready(function() {
[01:33:13] <Anticom> $(document).ready(function() {...}); should be enough
[01:34:40] <Gorkyman> Anticom: yeah I fixed that
[01:35:46] <Gorkyman> dr0id: http://pastebin.com/98ZP1pFS
[01:35:57] <Anticom> not sure, but it might have to do with .trigger('click');
[01:36:01] <Anticom> dunno fancybox
[01:36:02] <dr0id> how about getting rid of //<![CDATA[ bro ?
[01:36:47] <pr0ton> whats the best thing to use, when you want to enable scrolling in a div?
[01:37:00] <dr0id> CSS overflow property
[01:37:15] <pr0ton> dr0id, how?
[01:37:21] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: no I need to set the width through jquery, because I need to set the width of a div to be the same size as the window width, but that div is inside another div that is wider that the window size
[01:37:26] <dr0id> Gorkyman: I don't feel like helping you. pastebin the "correct"/"changed" code again
[01:37:47] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: so i can't just go width:100%... because then it will expand beyond the width of the window
[01:38:04] <blackspotwiggins> what's containers width?
[01:39:19] <aaairc> the containers width is the window width, plus the width of a second div that i'm using to do a slide in from right effect
[01:39:40] <Gorkyman> dr0id: http://pastebin.com/1EnuuZnc
[01:40:00] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, use positioning and dont exceed window width
[01:40:09] <dr0id> Gorkyman: did you do a bit of debugging ? does the form submits when you remove trigger('click'); ?
[01:40:13] <dr0id> submits twice*
[01:42:22] <Gorkyman> dr0id: yep, same thing
[01:42:54] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i'm using floats:left... just trust me on that. I'm doing something similar to this http://studio87.fr/home... but i'm not fully sliding from one div to the next. i'm sliding the second div only partially into the screen.
[01:43:18] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: for those types of transitions, you need a container div that is wider than the window, where you hide the overflow.
[01:44:10] <aaairc> so the main question would be... does anyone know how to ensure that jquery waits until the scroll bar loads (if the page is going to end up having a scroll bar) to measure the width of the page?
[01:44:25] <dr0id> seems ok, no idea. but you could make the code simpler and readable IMO, like $('#login-form').submit(function(){ $.post(url, data, function(){}); return false; });
[01:45:12] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, want to bet i can do it without that?
[01:45:21] <phryk> aaairc: doesn't $(document).ready() do that? no sure though, I'm pretty new to js
[01:46:49] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i doubt you could do it with less code
[01:47:11] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: but if you can i'd love to hear how to do it
[01:48:31] <Anticom> phryk $(document).ready(function() {....}); is fired, when the dom is ready to be manipulated
[01:48:45] <Anticom> $(function() {...}); would be the short form of that
[01:49:08] <phryk> Anticom: What conditions have to be met for the dom to be manipulatable?
[01:49:31] <aaairc> phryk: i'm pretty new too. actually you made me realize what is happening. document ready loads all the html, and then in my jquery code... i have an image loader... that drops images on the page only once they are loaded up. that scroll bar is only being added once enough images have loaded, so i need to check the width of the window a second time once all the images are loaded up to see if a scroll bar is added.
[01:49:35] <Anticom> Gorkyman you could use the jq ui dialog instead :P
[01:49:56] <Anticom> that works just fine, is simply to modify/configure and to style
[01:51:52] <phryk> aaairc: I had to do a resize-thingy for some kind of image-text gallery thing… I solved it the ugly way, resize function fires for window.onResize, $(document).ready(), whenever a new image is displayed and all 5 seconds in a loop, just to make sure ^^;
[01:52:11] <phryk> ah and on the onload of the first image
[01:53:18] <aaairc> phryk: nice. i'm gonna try and use that window.onResize to see if that gets it.
[01:53:41] <phryk> aaairc: that only fires if the window is resized… have no clue what you try to accomplish, though :P
[01:53:55] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, http://jsfiddle.net/fTXDA/
[01:54:11] <blackspotwiggins> animation needs tweaking, but the idea is there
[01:54:15] <phryk> Now that I think of it, first I just solved it with css which worked fine until i introduced a fading animation to the resized image, which ff did not like…
[01:54:36] <phryk> Same goes for setting the width/height of the image manually, so I ended up not using fade anyway…
[01:55:20] <phryk> s/just/first/(
[01:55:26] <phryk> grr minus the darn bracket
[01:55:30] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, this one is a bit better http://jsfiddle.net/fTXDA/1/
[01:55:35] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: checking it out. one difference is that i need the transition to work so that div 1 is still 200px wide, once div 2 slides in, which is why i thought float:left would make things easier
[01:55:37] <SilentPenguin> is evaa spamming anyone else on joining the channel?
[01:55:56] <DarsVaeda1> jup
[01:56:00] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, you can tweak left/right values as well
[01:56:20] <DarsVaeda1> already asked if someone could ban her, but guess no admin is online
[01:56:41] <SilentPenguin> well, this is more of an issue for the staffers
[01:56:49] <SilentPenguin> since it's network abuse
[01:59:48] <SilentPenguin> DarsVaeda1, there we go ;D
[01:59:49] <Khal_> spam me
[01:59:54] <etriaph> I'm having a problem with uniform when I append items to the dom, select fields aren't possible to select
[02:00:09] <SilentPenguin> Khal_, you're too late, they have been klined
[02:00:47] <Erthe> Anyone have any experience with uniform js?
[02:01:35] <Muimi> How do  you force google to recognize underlines?
[02:01:42] <bjhaid> hi, please what jquery function can I use to check when a http GET request hits my backend?
[02:02:05] <phryk> Muimi: What do you mean by recognizing underlines? O_o
[02:02:16] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: so to completely lay out what i'm trying to do. i have div 1, which starts out with initial width of 100%, and then when the transition occurs, it doesn't shift left. what happens is that the width of the div goes from 100% down to 200pixels wide, and then div 2 slides in after, taking up the rest of the space. is that possible to set up with what you sent me? i'm having a little difficulty doing that. the other 
[02:02:17] <aaairc> is that i'm doing an animation event, where all the images that were in div 1, get shrunk down, and their position adjusts from a table like view to being positioned straight down in their new 200 pixel wide column.
[02:03:09] <blackspotwiggins> image shrinking is a bit too much, but i can give you example for the first part
[02:03:49] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i've already got the image shrinking. i guess i could just fire it at the same time as when you do the addClass()
[02:03:59] <aaairc> if you could do the first part that would be a big help
[02:04:15] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: its funny you did this so quickly. i just spent like 4 hours on this
[02:04:50] <anli__> How do I get the dialog where a certain element is?
[02:05:40] <oDesk> how to drop ajax call which is in progress ?  it has been called by setTimeout(function(){}, 500)  but i want to drop it when $.unload()
[02:05:41] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, http://jsfiddle.net/fTXDA/2/
[02:06:12] <bjhaid> hi, please what jquery function/plugin can I use to check when a http GET request hits my backend?
[02:06:26] <anli__> oDesk: I would have used a boolean for that
[02:06:37] <blackspotwiggins> btw you could also use jquery animate to do the same thing
[02:06:45] <blackspotwiggins> i just use css3 because its faster/better
[02:06:58] <oDesk> anli__: how ?
[02:07:08] <anli__> In $.unload, you set a boolean to true
[02:07:15] <anli__> var unloaded = false;
[02:07:25] <anli__> Then in unload: unloaded = true;
[02:07:32] <anli__> In the event handler for the ajax call:
[02:07:39] <anli__> if (!unloaded) do_stuff();
[02:07:56] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: with these -webkit-transitions will it work on all browsers? is it a better solution than doing .animate() and adjusting css width properties? is it actually just the same thing?
[02:08:10] <anli__> Does your event handler produce empty alert boxes or something?
[02:08:12] <anli__> I have got that
[02:08:54] <blackspotwiggins> mostly everywhere, ie9+ in "My First Browser"-land
[02:09:21] <oDesk> anli__: I’m running observer which waits for data to display, but just wants to end the running request immediately on $.unload
[02:09:56] <aaairc> ie9+ in my first browser-land? whats that?
[02:10:03] <blackspotwiggins> i mean only ie9+
[02:10:06] <blackspotwiggins> for ie support
[02:10:09] <oDesk> anli__: using your method, i'd wait until the timeout then it check if (!unloaded)
[02:10:28] <blackspotwiggins> but you could just set .secondlevel properties using animate, and it should work as well
[02:10:41] <anli__> oDesk: yes
[02:11:20] <oDesk> anli__: that is not possible, the server has timeout of 3600 s
[02:11:27] <anli__> aha
[02:11:51] <anli__> You can always kill the timeout then
[02:12:15] <oDesk> anli__: how to kill it, that is the question
[02:12:44] <anli__> killTimeout
[02:12:57] <anli__> And the id that setTimeout gave you
[02:12:59] <anli__> as argument
[02:13:12] <anli__> nono
[02:13:13] <Aamir> clearTimeout
[02:13:14] <anli__> clearTimeout
[02:13:16] <anli__> Sorry
[02:13:24] <Aamir> kill is nice btw ;)
[02:13:27] <anli__> :)
[02:13:38] <anli__> function killTimeout(id) { clearTimeout(id); }
[02:13:51] <Aamir> :)
[02:13:55] <blackspotwiggins> window.killTimeout = window.clearTimeout would be easier :P
[02:13:57] <anli__> But keeping ids is not so beautiful maybe
[02:14:04] <anli__> hehehe
[02:14:07] <blackspotwiggins> actually
[02:14:25] <anli__> Strange that there is no method killing all timeouts
[02:14:34] <Anticom> moar coffeeeeeee
[02:14:35] <Anticom> >.>
[02:14:44] <oDesk> anli__: maybe loop
[02:14:46] <anli__> Would be great when protecting against greasemonkey scripting :)
[02:14:56] <anli__> oDesk: But you need to know which ids there are
[02:15:04] <blackspotwiggins> hmm
[02:15:08] <anli__> And variables is ugly
[02:15:08] <blackspotwiggins> are timeouts scoped?
[02:15:12] <anli__> are
[02:15:38] <anli__> If you want to protect against a greasemonkey script, there is a guarantee you dont know the ids
[02:16:13] <anli__> blackspotwiggins: You mean that if you have an event handler for a timeout in a function, you want to access the locals?
[02:16:25] <anli__> thats possible to do
[02:16:27] <anli__> So yes
[02:17:29] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i tried to do it with .animate() but it doesn't seem to transition nicely. i imagine i'm doing something wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/fTXDA/4/
[02:18:30] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, works fine for me
[02:18:35] <blackspotwiggins> as i said css3 is faster
[02:19:17] <mrf> hi. I am getting a problem where a drop down menu is selecting on mouseover as well as click. This only occurs in Firefox 4+. Is this a known issue with Jquery or am I likely to be using it wrong
[02:20:01] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i was trying it in chrome where it didn't work. just tested it in firefox and yes it does animate there as expected.
[02:21:37] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: so css3 is faster, better... but doesn't it seems like a big deal if 20% of the users who go to the site, it won't work (the number of people with ie8 or lower
[02:21:43] <DannyZB> what do you mean by selecting on mouseover?
[02:22:00] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: do you see what i mean with chrome?
[02:22:50] <mrf> DannyZB: If I drop down the list and hover over and item but then click elsewhere on the page it is acting as if I have selected that option (using selectedIndex)
[02:23:07] <Aamir> ?target @mrf
[02:23:07] <bot-t> mrf, event.target: The DOM element that initiated the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[02:23:35] <oDesk> anli__: um.. that didn't work for me.... um.. anyway to not start ajax call to the same url that in progress ?
[02:25:50] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, yeah
[02:26:32] <DannyZB> mrf: so whats the problem with it?
[02:26:39] <blackspotwiggins> looks like the second animation is not wokring for some reason
[02:27:13] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: yeah
[02:27:23] <blackspotwiggins> it might be a jquery bug
[02:27:32] <blackspotwiggins> because percentage -> px animation doesnt work
[02:27:40] <blackspotwiggins> but percentage -> percentage is ok
[02:28:00] <anli__> oDesk: You make a short lived ajax call once per hour, right?
[02:28:04] <mrf> DannyZB: Its causing aproblem with a button that should be allowed to be pressed until an item is selected from the list.
[02:28:23] <toomy> is there a way to use $('html') as a selector, but exclude a particular div and its contents?
[02:28:30] <mrf> s/should/shouldn't
[02:31:18] <hron85> Hi! Is there other way to refresh page than location.reload(true); ?
[02:31:55] <Kambfhase> window.location = window.location
[02:32:20] <Kambfhase> ?not @ toomy
[02:32:20] <bot-t> toomy, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[02:32:49] <pngl> Is it possible to access the processed data in a complete callback? Unlike success, it has no data parameter and I do not see a corresponding property in the jqXHR object.
[02:33:25] <anli__> tommy: why do you want to select every element?
[02:33:44] <anli__> And I think "html *" is more appropriate
[02:34:10] <gnarf> just "*" if you want every element
[02:34:20] <anli__> yeah, thats the most appropriate
[02:34:22] <anli__> :)
[02:36:19] <oDesk> anli__: sorry i went for some minutes.  well yes i make long-polling ajax call which re-initiates if expired within one hour so actually it runs forever and re-initiated every hour if expired
[02:36:48] <oDesk> anli__: what i want is to not initiate another call to the same url which already in progress
[02:37:11] <anli__> Aha, so the server side sits and wait for 3600 seconds before it replies?
[02:38:05] <rchavik> hi.. given http://pastebin.com/ASkvjCng,  what selector can i use to get the index of div element that has 'error' class ?
[02:38:08] <oDesk> anli__: no, once server replied the call drops so the timeout will re-initiate it again
[02:38:16] <anli__> aha
[02:38:29] <kaista> rchavik .error ?
[02:38:37] <anli__> well, clearTimeout should do
[02:38:47] <anli__> But dont forget to pass the id as argument
[02:38:53] <anli__> clearTimeout(timeout_id);
[02:38:58] <anli__> The id that setTimeout gave you
[02:39:06] <bjhaid> Please, is there anyway I can check with jquery if a new element has been added to my db?
[02:39:28] <anli__> bjhaid: Use $.post to call a server side script then
[02:39:30] <rchavik> kaista, i need the index value, as in: div element number 2 that is contained by .panes
[02:39:51] <bjhaid> anli__: then what?
[02:41:47] <oDesk> anli__: i tried to cleartimeout using the it's ID and it's still running
[02:42:12] <Kambfhase> rchavik: $('div.error').closest('div.pane').index()
[02:42:30] <hron85> okay, there is an another problem. I try call $.ajax, but the success callback is not called, even if the call ended with HTTP 200. I must return with data on server side, to trigger calling callback?
[02:43:00] <rchavik> Kambfhase, thanks !!
[02:43:05] <Kambfhase> np
[02:43:13] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: yeah, percentage to percentage worked. i need that width that it shrinks down too, to be fixed though... or at least have a minimum and maximum width. to accomplish that though i guess i'll need to change the width to its pixel width right before i do the animation using jquery?
[02:44:12] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: given this is what i'm trying to do, do you still think absolute positioning is preferable to doing floats?
[02:44:14] <anli__> bjhaid: Then the client side gets a reply, it will know if the element has been added
[02:44:25] <anli__> oDesk: Strange
[02:45:23] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, unless you have huge amount of people using ie8 or lower, just use css3 version
[02:45:33] <anli__> Hm, if I remember it correctly, timeout manipulation calls needs to be in event handlers
[02:45:49] <blackspotwiggins> then again, even if you do - they get functionally correct page, just without bling
[02:46:07] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: thats true. also the css3 doesn't seem to work on ipad
[02:46:20] <blackspotwiggins> hm?
[02:46:43] <Kambfhase> ie6 user dont get bling, they get blink!
[02:46:52] <seutje> bot-t: tell coldhead no u don't!
[02:46:53] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[02:47:00] <anli__> oDesk: the 2nd code snippet on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1893533/using-cleartimeout-to-cancel-a-timeout-event
[02:47:01] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: that transition effect doesn't  work when i test it on an ipad. it just jumps into place.
[02:47:11] <blackspotwiggins> ios 5 ?
[02:47:14] <seutje> bot-t: tell dytrivedi aw <3
[02:47:14] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[02:47:15] <sevenpluseight> hi all, I've got a jQuery countdown timer, it's working nicely to the date of the time I want it to be, but i am trying to set it to the exact hour of the day that the event will happen, here's what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/sLwBD/ any idea how I can get it to be to an exact time?
[02:47:25] <aaairc> whatever is the latest...
[02:47:31] <aaairc> bought the ipad 2 days ago
[02:48:00] <blackspotwiggins> dunno, ios should support that stuff
[02:49:07] <hron85> Ok, this is my problem: i send ajax req, it ends with HTTP 200 but the callback doesnt called. http://pastie.org/2230788
[02:49:13] <seutje> sevenpluseight: why don't u just put the exact hour in the new Date statement?
[02:49:24] <hron85> the path is correct
[02:49:36] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: in terms of users its just a website open to anyone, and 20% of the internet is ie8 or older... so thats a pretty big chunk of people. the jump into place though without the transition isn't terrible. like you said still functionally correct.
[02:49:59] <sevenpluseight> seutje, when I tried that, it starts over everytime the page is refreshed
[02:50:01] <blackspotwiggins> anyway, you could experiment with floats as well
[02:50:09] <blackspotwiggins> but i recommend not making anything larger than viewport
[02:50:24] <seutje> sevenpluseight: what is the date ur trying to count down to?
[02:50:24] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: why?
[02:50:40] <sevenpluseight> august 9th, 2011 8pm
[02:50:54] <blackspotwiggins> it's usually not necessary and adds extra complexity
[02:51:03] <blackspotwiggins> and most probably overengineering
[02:54:34] <sevenpluseight> seutje: August 9th, 2011 8:00pm (sorry forgot nick completor)
[02:58:18] <timing> Hi guys!
[02:58:36] <timing> how do I detect if an ajax request was aborted due to the user navigating away during the request?
[02:59:42] <t4nk013> hiyt
[03:00:29] <blackspotwiggins> timer, onabort?
[03:00:50] <blackspotwiggins> timing even
[03:02:38] <shesek_> hron85, does it actually return JSON? it seems like you aren't expecting any response from there
[03:07:08] <timing> blackspotwiggins: not somewhere in the global ajaxError ? It does fire on this type of abort
[03:07:31] <blackspotwiggins> maybe it does, not sure
[03:07:37] <blackspotwiggins> onabort fires for sure
[03:07:45] <blackspotwiggins> but when you are navigating away you cant do much anyway
[03:07:59] <timing> yeah my gui shows the request failed
[03:08:05] <timing> it's able to do that still
[03:08:09] <timing> so I just want to skip that part
[03:08:15] <whateverb> how can I use preventDefault() and keep smart url on anchor link sliding? http://pastebin.com/0Y4PZ0Zz
[03:09:40] <timing> whateverb: change self.location.hash after the animation?
[03:09:50] <timing> whateverb: just an idea, no idea if it actually works
[03:10:29] <Lion31> hello... in my app I have a each loop and I populate my HTML string and after populating all I attach it to the DOM (via $(el).html($html_string))... it works as expected in FF, IE and opera... but chrome does mess with elements ORDER!!! wtf... why? you can check the example here: http://razvoj.mesetar.com/oglasi/spisek/zadnji_oglasi.html
[03:11:47] <Lion31> oh now I see it messes in opera too :S
[03:12:09] <whateverb> timing, location.hash = $(this).attr('href'); ?
[03:12:11] <Lion31> IE and FF have one order of elements, chrome and opera another :S

[03:13:49] <whateverb> nope, isn't working :S
[03:14:00] <timing> whateverb: hmm too bad
[03:14:33] <timing> whateverb: or try self.location = url + hash ?

If the scroll bar is at the top i.e. top of the page, dialog box appears in the center of the screen but if the scroll bar is at the bottom or in the middle, dialog box also gets scrolled and appears the same previous location i.e. at the center of the page when scroll bar was at the top. How to make dialog box to appear in the center irrespective of t
[03:45:10] <hariom> he scroll bar position?
[03:46:36] <birdpoop>  Hi, is it possible to use an ajax post in combination with the .live() handler?
[03:48:57] <hariom> How to make dialog box appear at the center respective of the scroll bar position in the background page? I am show a div as the dialog box by showing or hiding it at the center of the window using left=screen.width/2 and top = screen.height/2
[03:50:04] <shesek_> hron85, if you tell jQuery that the dataType is json, in order for the request to be considered successful the response must be valid JSON
[03:50:14] <shesek_> hron85, it doesn't have to be {success:true}, just any valid JSON
[04:04:35] <birdpoop> How can i catch the submit of a form using the live() handler so i can do an ajax post?
[04:05:16] <hariom> http://jsfiddle.net/zyGUy/
[04:05:30] <hariom> In the result section, if the scroll bar is set to end of the page, running the screen actually doesn't show the dialog as it has been scrolled up
[04:06:17] <hariom> I don't want to auto drag the scroll bar to the top. Irrespective of its position, dialog should appear in the center.

[04:16:10] <anli__> Is option:visible:first referring to the first visible option?

[04:31:24] <anli__> If I close a jquery ui dialog with the cross button, shouldnt the dialog be removed from the DOM then?
[04:31:41] <anli__> Seems that I am still able to select items in it using jquery
[04:32:20] <Deele> anli__, no, it just hides them
[04:32:34] <anli__> Can I make the dialog elements go away?
[04:33:04] <Deele> afaik, dialog works with hidden element, if you remove it, it wont open again
[04:33:14] <Deele> only after reload
[04:33:16] <anli__> But I will create another one
[04:33:27] <Deele> why then you need to remove old one?
[04:33:35] <anli__> Because I dont use it anymore
[04:33:45] <Deele> then hide it
[04:33:46] <Deele> :)
[04:33:51] <Deele> for later use
[04:33:57] <anli__> I will never use it later
[04:34:12] <Deele> you dont understand meaning of "dialogs"
[04:34:15] <Deele> appearantly
[04:34:19] <anli__> yes, I do
[04:34:24] <anli__> And the word "never"
[04:34:51] <Deele> use html('') for parent element or... let me have a look on docs
[04:35:10] <anli__> I found something I will try
[04:35:24] <Deele> remove()
[04:35:34] <anli__> Seems that I have to use destroy as well
[04:36:18] <anli__> Hm, but destroy will only show the element that is the origin of the dialog, right?
[04:36:38] <Deele> ?
[04:36:43] <Deele> what destroy
[04:36:55] <anli__> foo.dialog('destroy');
[04:37:50] <BlaDe^> can I do a select for $('li[rel=value]') ?
[04:38:07] <Deele> anli__, it will destroy it, AND return element
[04:38:14] <Deele> anli__, if you want it to use again
[04:38:26] <Deele> BlaDe^, you can :)
[04:38:31] <anli__> Ah, ok
[04:38:39] <anli__> Well, this was perfect
[04:38:45] <anli__> it gone away
[04:38:59] <anli__> The dialog is created from an element thats created with script
[04:39:04] <oDesk> anli__: just wants to tell you that i've used  var req = $.ajax()   then req.abort();
[04:39:18] <anli__> Meaning that I will have a lot of hidden dialogs very quickly as the user opens and closes dialogs
[04:39:25] <anli__> oDesk: Aha!
[04:39:39] <Deele> anli__, why not use same again, just change its contents?
[04:39:43] <BlaDe^> Deele: if (holder.find('li[rel="' + value + '"]').length)  --- doesn't work
[04:39:45] <anli__> I want a fresh one
[04:39:52] <Deele> :)
[04:39:53] <anli__> The contents will also change some
[04:39:57] <BlaDe^> but the li is difinitely there, and definitely has the same rel
[04:40:21] <Deele> BlaDe^, try to reproduce your problem in jsfiddle.net
[04:40:43] <dr0id> rel for li ? :S
[04:40:48] <Deele> then, paste here a link
[04:40:52] <anli__> I have started to always create dialogs with script and the code for some reason becomes much prettier
[04:41:21] <Deele> anli__, sure, you can do it, if it's not templated
[04:41:42] <anli__> Not only that I can do it, its nicer, but templated you say?
[04:41:52] <Deele> anli__, or if it is templated, then make server side to generate templated dialog
[04:41:52] <anli__> Never heard of
[04:42:15] <anli__> templates is C++ to me
[04:44:26] <Deele> I mean something like templated HTML elements, like Smarty
[04:44:55] <anli__> ok
[04:44:57] <anli__> Never used
[04:45:56] <anli__> Its nice to not have a lot of hidden elements in the webpage, thats why scripting rocks
[04:46:06] <anli__> i.e. dialog contents
[04:46:19] <Deele> where content generation is seperate from data retrival and calculations...
[04:46:54] <OzDave_mbp> smarty probably relies on includes so you could do that with a few different languages
[04:47:36] <Deele> smarty is another story, I'm just mentioning, if guy knows it...
[04:47:54] <OzDave_mbp> if you know of the zen garden project where the sites content is removed from the data.
[04:48:12] <Deele> you can eaven generate dialog template inside inline/head script, to use in html
[04:48:56] <Deele> I just dont like people relying on thousands of scripts in html
[04:48:58] <OzDave_mbp> include modules server side and you have a framework you could work with
[04:49:23] <anli__> scripts should always be in .js files
[04:50:30] <Deele> anli__, ofcourse, but if you need to add some dynamic content in html, without using tons of hidden elements, that contain some variable values... :)
[04:50:42] <Deele> I mean, dynamic content in JS
[04:51:35] <anli__> Oh, I almost never use hidden variables for that, but most of the variables are not needed, everything is in the gui anyway
[04:51:40] <richardjprice> hello, how would i hide just the text of a link
[04:52:02] <anli__> So when I need some information, I call a function that extracts data from the gui
[04:52:37] <Deele> richardjprice, hide text of link, what do you mean?
[04:52:52] <Deele> <a href="some_url">text to be hidden</a> ?
[04:53:25] <richardjprice> Deele: yes, the 'text to be hidden', i'd like to remove that
[04:53:32] <richardjprice> but keep the link
[04:53:38] <Deele> $('a').html('')
[04:53:49] <Cork> thats not hiding though
[04:53:58] <Deele> he said, remove
[04:54:06] <anli__> $('a').remove();
[04:54:11] <Cork> "hide just the text"
[04:54:15] <Cork> no he didn't
[04:54:16] <Deele> anli__, no, that wont leave link
[04:54:21] <anli__> Aah
[04:54:23] <Deele> Cork,  <richardjprice> Deele: yes, the 'text to be hidden', i'd like to remove that
[04:54:24] <seutje> u ppl make my head hurt :(
[04:54:24] <richardjprice> i'm after ideas here, i would like to leave the link, then hide the text
[04:54:28] <richardjprice> sorry about the confusion
[04:54:44] <Cork> richardjprice: set the text color to transparent
[04:54:44] <OzDave_mbp> bool the link and toggle it with a ahref and non ahref
[04:54:44] <seutje> a { text-indent: -999em; } /* CC */
[04:54:59] <Cork> or add a span inside it and make it visibility: hidden;
[04:55:03] <Deele> seutje, ugly :P
[04:55:10] <richardjprice> ok some good ideas, thank you
[04:55:19] <seutje> Deele: how can invisible be ugly? :P
[04:55:28] <Deele> Cork, that is best case, to add span
[04:55:30] <anli__> $('a').function(){ var a = $(this); var link = a.attr('href'); a.replaceWith(link); } or something
[04:55:43] <Cork> Deele: i agree
[04:55:45] <Deele> anli__, that is mor eugly
[04:55:51] <anli__> ok...
[04:55:59] <seutje> fine, a { position: absolute; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0); }
[04:56:06] <Cork> lol
[04:56:07] <Cork> nice
[04:56:22] <seutje> a:focus { position: static; clip: auto; }
[04:56:33] <Deele> thats already hardcore :)
[04:56:41] <Deele> not needed for such easy taks
[04:56:42] <richardjprice> cheers for the ideas folks

[05:06:32] <Me-Selfe> I have a div containing lots of pictures. The pictures got .click() events attached, and the div got mousedown/mousemove/mouseup events attached. The problem is that if i click on the pictures, i never get the picture .click() event, just the div's mousedown event. I thought the picture event would be fired before the event bubble to the div? Anyone know how to fix this?
[05:07:01] <gnarf> Me-Selfe: the click event is fired after a mouse-up
[05:07:19] <gnarf> and if you aren't stopping the event in the outer div, the click should still fire

[05:19:24] <Ignition-IRC> gnarf: thanks that fixes that issue
[05:20:58] <Me-Selfe> gnarf: it seem that its because i add an element to the div in the mousedown.. If i return before its appended, it works.. Weird :/
[05:21:40] <Anticom> re
[05:21:47] <gnarf> is the element you're adding appearing above the element being "clicked" ?
[05:23:20] <Me-Selfe> gnarf: darn, stupid me... I add it at cursor position.. added 1 px to it and it works. Thanks a bunch
[05:23:48] <pr0ton> how do you disable cache for localhost on Chrome/FF ?
[05:23:56] <pr0ton> Chrome caches JS and CSS files
[05:23:58] <pr0ton> which is annoying
[05:24:39] <gnarf> pr0ton: don't use localhost?
[05:25:01] <pr0ton> no i mean, i want to disable caching for localhost
[05:25:12] <pr0ton> where i'm testing my applications....
[05:25:32] <Haprog> just force reload without cache. I'm not sure about chrome but try Ctrl+R
[05:25:47] <pr0ton> Haprog, i've tried... and it just doesnt download it again
[05:25:51] <Haprog> ok
[05:25:51] <gnarf> i never use "localhost" - but there's a really good chance you could solve your issue with tweaking the cache control headers served by apache
[05:25:57] <pr0ton> i saw the Network tab in Inspect Element
[05:26:08] <Haprog> in firefox I would use Ctrl+Shift+R
[05:26:31] <pr0ton> Haprog, that is to load without caching anything?
[05:26:34] <Haprog> or even just F5 a couple of times usually does it
[05:26:37] <Haprog> yes
[05:26:52] <pr0ton> ok, thanks
[05:27:10] <gnarf> pr0ton: http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/apache-speed-cache-control.html
[05:27:33] <pr0ton> gnarf, na, i dont want to modify apache... right now. just wanted to know a client side fix
[05:27:46] <pr0ton> Ctrl-Shift-R seems to be working for me
[05:27:51] <OzDave_mbp> make a cache of zero bytes
[05:27:54] <OzDave_mbp> just sayin
[05:27:56] <gnarf> *shrug*

[05:32:35] <grid_> hey i use a jquery popup script i want to use the onClick attribute in the <a> element to fire of the javascript handler, can somebody help me? there is a hyperlink on the right place already http://jsfiddle.net/yKShG/
[06:17:50] <MetaJake> might anyone suggest some documentation which illustrates how to send an image from my computer harddrive to a python script on my server via a web form image uploader?
[06:18:23] <daniel2011z> hi, can someone point me to a jquery for doing captcha?
[06:18:35] <MetaJake> ^I'm sorry.. I mean I am using Jquery on the user front-end to allow image uploading from the User's computer
[06:18:45] <blackspotwiggins> MetaJake, 1) create a <form> 2) add <input type="file"> and <input type="submit"> 3) press submit 4) this is a jquery channel, not web development for newbies
[06:19:19] <mbrevda> why does looping over an object seem to be looping over strange keys like "length", "prevObject", and "context"?
[06:19:30] <MetaJake> blackspotwiggins, thank you. I am sorry, might you suggest what channel/community I should be using for these kind of questions?
[06:19:47] <blackspotwiggins> read up on basic html
[06:19:53] <blackspotwiggins> google can probably help you
[06:20:49] <MetaJake> blackspotwiggins thanks
[06:21:37] <OzDave_mbp> daniel2011z:  I did one catchpa in php with layered painting of squares and then fonts. Do you have access to the back end? php gd lib might be an alternative
[06:22:01] <solars> hey, does anyone know good resources for jquery mobile vs sencha touch? we have to decide which of both to use
[06:22:49] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: this is server-side captcha using php, and you are the author of it?
[06:23:10] <OzDave_mbp> yeah you have to add the gd lib to php for it to work
[06:24:22] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: poses a new question, and that is do i do server-side or client-side captcha first?
[06:24:42] <OzDave_mbp> I would do it server side so the script cant be read
[06:26:12] <mbrevda> how am I iterating FOUR times, if there is only ONE object?! http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/598/screenshot20110718at422.png
[06:26:34] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: i guess you would only implement one or the other not both when it comes to captcha.
[06:26:57] <OzDave_mbp> You would be defeating the purpose if you did it client side
[06:27:54] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: i thought the main idea was to avoid spambots, which i assume don't "read" scripts.
[06:28:09] <OzDave_mbp> there are scripts that can read scripts
[06:28:24] <OzDave_mbp> there are scripts that unfold email obsfucation
[06:28:32] <blackspotwiggins> mbrevda, why are you iterating over jquery objects?
[06:28:46] <OzDave_mbp> the reason why you present an image is to make the image very hard to process
[06:28:58] <mbrevda> blackspotwiggins: I though it would act the same as a json object
[06:29:16] <blackspotwiggins> try with $.map
[06:29:29] <blackspotwiggins> $.fn.map behaves weirdly and doesnt return plain objects
[06:29:59] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: by "read" scripts you mean the source code, such that it can determine what image is presented?
[06:30:39] <blackspotwiggins> also, it's probably easier to use .each
[06:30:47] <blackspotwiggins> without the extra map part anyway
[06:31:11] <OzDave_mbp> yep, you can parse or rake all the scripts to another program that uses regular expressions to filter out content, for example, you can rake emails from the @ symbol or the ascii equivalent of it
[06:31:13] <mbrevda> blackspotwiggins: $.map seems to return something more sensable
[06:32:10] <mbrevda> blackspotwiggins: I have a nested for and I though it would produce cleaner code to map first then iterate over an object
[06:32:50] <blackspotwiggins> that depends on what you are actually trying to achieve
[06:33:21] <mbrevda> blackspotwiggins:  seems I cant use $(this) when doing $.map. Is there an easy alternative?
[06:33:40] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: but the images presented are random. there is no way of knowing what is what. the only drawback i can see is that a) client-side may have script disabled 2) client-side is open to hacking of the script such that it will accept any response. is that what you mean?
[06:33:55] <blackspotwiggins> mbrevda, the first argument (or was it second)
[06:33:57] <Me-Selfe> mbrevda: Not sure what you're trying to do, but using .each() and $(this) worked lots of times for me
[06:36:20] <OzDave_mbp> <?php  //    header("Content - Type : image/gif"};  // $image = imagecreate(128,128); imaggif($image);   // ?>     remove the // for carriage returns. thats the basis to making a gd lib image with php
[06:37:07] <OzDave_mbp> knowing how the code works to make the images just gives the opponent more opportunities to exploit you
[06:37:13] <OzDave_mbp> wasting time and effort
[06:37:35] <OzDave_mbp> imagegif* typo
[06:38:14] <OzDave_mbp> http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagechar.php
[06:38:46] <OzDave_mbp> and http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagefilledrectangle.php
[06:38:58] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: right. i was thinking of a captcha where user has to click on the right image. eg. please click on house image.
[06:39:05] <OzDave_mbp> rectangles and font shapes is the basis to a decent one but you can get a lot more elaborate
[06:39:22] <OzDave_mbp> the logic can be exploited like dogsballs if its client side
[06:39:29] <motaka2> from line 17 to 26  I try to create an onclick event but nothing but doesnt work considering i creat the button using javascript , what should I do ?  http://pastebin.com/mqjUseeq
[06:40:06] <OzDave_mbp> It wont matter how good the catchpa is if the client has an opportunity to look at the algorythym
[06:41:44] <Me-Selfe> motaka2: the element have to exist before you register the click event...
[06:42:08] <Me-Selfe> So, the .click() code must be ran after you add the element to the code
[06:42:40] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: an algorithm that spits out a set of images for the user to select a specified image to distinguish the user as "human" is about recognises images, not so much the algorithm??
[06:42:50] <motaka2> Me-Selfe: where should I put it ?
[06:43:09] <OzDave_mbp> daniel2011z:  how many ways would you like me to say it
[06:43:17] <chilversc_> anyone know of a schedular widget that uses jquery? something similar to http://www.ext-scheduler.com/examples/grouping/grouping.html
[06:43:28] <Me-Selfe> motaka2: the element dont exist till you add it at: $(".shls-search-res").html(result);
[06:43:37] <Me-Selfe> So, the .click() have to be added after that
[06:44:10] <daniel2011z> OzDave_mbp: only once if it is convincesingly ;)
[06:44:16] <OzDave_mbp> hehe
[06:44:22] <motaka2> Me-Selfe: I did and I got no result ?
[06:45:40] <potato> hi
[06:45:56] <potato> could anyone give me a hint using context in an ajax call?
[06:46:05] <motaka2> Me-Selfe: look at this:  http://pastebin.com/0xzA0mCe I have it added to the end , but yet no result
[06:46:55] <potato> I am passing $(this) as context, for a change in a select, that invokes an ajax call, but when I try to use $(this) on the success call, it does not work
[06:47:28] <Cork> potato: you need to store it in a variable
[06:47:30] <Me-Selfe> motaka2: you moved the code after "in the code", but its still executed before the element is added
[06:47:52] <Cork> potato: this is returned in the callback so your var is replaced
[06:47:53] <Me-Selfe> motaka2: as an example, you can put it right after the ...html(result); line
[06:48:34] <Cork> potato: a simple var $self = $(this); $.ajax(... $self); works
[06:48:42] <potato> ah i see
[06:48:51] <potato> let me try
[06:49:02] <potato> thank you for your replies
[06:49:07] <Cork> np
[06:50:54] <jomofcw> How could I get each textNode (and only textNode) of a document ?

[06:51:11] <bot-t> jomofcw, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:51:42] <jomofcw> Cork Hello and thanks, but I want to iterate and modify each one...
[06:52:01] <Cork> jomofcw: html don't really have the notion of text in that form
[06:52:21] <Cork> *sorry dom don't have
[06:53:29] <licnep> i have two sortable lists with different kinds elements, when an element is dropped from one list into another i don't want the default behaviour, i want to call a custom method to create an object suitable for that list
[06:53:37] <licnep> look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/licnep/QMaZD/1/
[06:53:38] <jomofcw> Cork OK I understand. I just find this, I will try it
[06:54:03] <licnep> if you drop an element from the red list to the blue one, my custom blue element appears, but the red one is there too
[06:54:14] <Cork> jomofcw: its in a way a legacy of its "make it simple" history
[06:54:18] <licnep> i don't want the red element to end up in the blue list
[06:54:37] <licnep> any hint?
[06:54:40] <bfred> problem with the scope: the animateToPage function always uses the variables defined LAST, while outside of it variables are correct: http://pastie.org/2231712
[06:56:24] <seutje> bfred: well duh
[06:57:14] <seutje> bfred: if u wanna act upon something regardless of everything alse going on, pass it
[06:57:19] <seutje> else*
[06:57:43] <bfred> ugh
[06:57:49] <bfred> alright
[07:00:43] <bfred> seutje: doesn't animateToPage have a local scope? why does it use the elements of another scope (or is overwritte by the latest loop)
[07:02:34] <seutje> I'm confused about this, why are u even redefining a function over and over again?
[07:04:02] <bfred> seutje: so it only uses the variables in the local scope, I thought
[07:04:25] <seutje> I dunno, I'm new here
[07:06:34] <dpy> hi guys
[07:07:18] <motaka2> Me-Selfe: thank you so much
[07:07:22] <dpy> does anyone know if jQuery has a utility function to html-escape a string?    (I need to set a title attribute with escaped html)
[07:07:24] <bfred> jeez, it turned out like this: animateToPage($list,$elements,padding,elementsPerPage,currentPage);
[07:07:35] <bfred> refactoring...
[07:07:45] <seutje> what the
[07:08:03] <seutje> none of these are ambiguous settings u can just store in ur global namespace or something?
[07:08:10] <blackspotwiggins> dpy, $("<div>").html(escapethis).text() kindof works
[07:08:20] <bfred> seutje: isn't global bad? :P
[07:08:45] <potato> thank you to those who helped me, i can now use the context correctly. i only have one more doubt: i want to change the select background color to green, using animate, which i can do already using $(selOption).animate( {backgroundColor: "#00cc00"}, 800) but now I want to restore the original background color , how can i do it?
[07:08:47] <dpy> blackspotwiggins: couldn't they wrap this in a function?  ...  how hard could it be?
[07:08:49] <motaka2>  lets say i have sevral items .selected-units-items, how can i attach click to all of them ?
[07:08:59] <NL_Ed> Hi all, who can help me with UI multiselect
[07:09:01] <blackspotwiggins> it's not hard
[07:09:07] <blackspotwiggins> it's also not very common thing to do
[07:09:27] <dpy> btw, shouldn't that be:  $("<div>").text(escapethis).html()   ?
[07:09:41] <blackspotwiggins> no
[07:09:44] <bfred> seutje: blah, copy/paste for the lazy
[07:09:52] <bfred> double that function
[07:09:58] <blackspotwiggins> test the difference yourself
[07:10:10] <seutje> bfred: jQuery is on the global namespace
[07:10:16] <seutje> HIDE YO KIDS!
[07:10:22] <bfred> :P
[07:11:20] <dr0id> WHERE'S THE FUN ?
[07:11:36] <bfred> isn't there a way to call that function from the local context so it uses the right variables? I tried animateToPage.call(this, currentPage)
[07:12:38] <dpy>  $("<div>").html('hello:"world"').text()
[07:12:38] <dpy> "hello:"world""
[07:12:43] <dpy> on console
[07:13:21] <dpy> i would've expected: "hello:&quot;world&quot;"
[07:13:48] <seutje> ?eval escape('hello:"world"')
[07:13:51] <bot-t> seutje: "hello%3A%22world%22"
[07:14:09] <seutje> that's not the escapage I was looking for :(

[07:15:59] <blackspotwiggins> dpy, wat
[07:16:10] <blackspotwiggins> why would you expect &quot;
[07:16:31] <seutje> and why not expect all chars to be escaped to their unicode entity?
[07:17:31] <seutje> javascript needs a String.escapeTheseRandomCharsForNoReason()
[07:17:32] <bfred> seutje: tadaaaa! this..animateToPage = function () { ... }
[07:17:35] <bfred> it works

[07:18:54] <dr0id> _0_
[07:19:11] <seutje> dpy: way to try it the hard war o.O
[07:19:14] <motaka2> Cork but it doesnt work
[07:19:22] <blackspotwiggins> you need to escape entities in attributes?
[07:19:25] <seutje> $(foo).attr('lol: "this works fine"')
[07:19:27] <blackspotwiggins> why?
[07:19:37] <seutje> ups
[07:19:39] <dr0id> motaka2: you could just do $(this).remove();
[07:19:47] <seutje> $(foo).attr('heh', 'lol: "this works fine"')
[07:19:50] <Cork> motaka2: ah, clickedObj is the dom object, you need to wrapp it in a jquery object
[07:19:53] <dpy> seutje: because I am creating a large chunk of html code at once
[07:20:03] <seutje> so?
[07:20:04] <Lampoon> so are you
[07:20:06] <dr0id> $("#foo").attr('heh', 'lolwut');
[07:20:11] <blackspotwiggins> anyway, if that's true
[07:20:11] <dpy> seutje: that's more readable than a quadrillion jquery statements
[07:20:20] <blackspotwiggins> .attr() would escape that anyway i think
[07:20:28] <seutje> yea, I really don't see the problem
[07:20:37] <motaka2> Cork how to do so ?
[07:20:48] <seutje> so ur gonna escape half of it along the way to make it *more* readable?
[07:20:49] <Cork> motaka2: check dr0id's responce
[07:21:11] <Cork> motaka2: ugg another error
[07:21:12] <dr0id> yeah bro, you should always check my response.
[07:21:17] <dr0id> jQuery Master Race Here.

[07:21:31] <Cork> motaka2: its the event object
[07:21:33] <dpy> look, if web pages were meant to be programmed, then it would have been a program that dynamically generated all elements, this is not the case
[07:21:42] <Cork> motaka2: this is the element you want to send forward
[07:21:43] <dr0id> why isn't it the case ?
[07:21:45] <dpy> specification is better than programming
[07:21:56] <seutje> I'ma quote blackspotwiggins at this point
[07:22:04] <dpy> you are only meant to fall back to programming when specification is not possible
[07:22:06] <blackspotwiggins> dpy, so you are manually creating html? instead of using .attr() ?
[07:22:09] <seutje> "meh"
[07:22:14] <dr0id> "pfft"
[07:22:24] <bfred> dr0id: 8===|)
[07:22:26] <seutje> have fun writing your custom escape function
[07:22:30] <Cork> motaka2: http://pastebin.com/0qRbTJdV
[07:22:35] <seutje> or rip it from php.js
[07:22:35] <dr0id> bfred: ?
[07:22:45] <dpy> in this case, it is possible, just someone forgot to add the escapeHTML function  (in contrast: escape/unescape/escapeURI/unescapeURI have been added)
[07:23:02] <bfred> dr0id: I saw you were having fun with faces 5 minutes ago
[07:23:09] <dpy> blackspotwiggins: yes, manually creating html is preferred for larger chunks

[07:25:27] <blackspotwiggins> next is using libraries for http instead of doing manually :)
[07:26:08] <kborchers> Ownatik: it is hard to help you if we can't reproduce the error as well. see ?demo
[07:26:09] <bot-t> Ownatik, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:26:12] <Cork> Ownatik: you don't need to select down to the option
[07:26:15] <seutje> wish we could go back to good old switchboards with people physically operating them as u make a call
[07:26:19] <dpy> I wasn't talking about html soup
[07:26:27] <Cork> Ownatik: just run .val on the select element instead
[07:26:55] <Cork> Ownatik: that is remove "option:selected"
[07:27:02] <dpy> and imho html fragments are a good thing
[07:28:13] <chilversc_> can't find a scheduler, so to use jsext or to write something myself, hmm
[07:28:24] <Ownatik> Cork: thank you
[07:28:34] <Cork> Ownatik: did that help?
[07:28:45] <Ownatik> yes it solved the error
[07:28:53] * Cork nods
[07:29:02] <seutje> oooh right, it's a select
[07:29:23] <Ownatik> now the only error left is the weird error in jquery.js, only in IE again ...
[07:29:57] <Ownatik> still "bject doesn't support this property or method"
[07:30:21] <Cork> Ownatik: try finding what line causes it
[07:30:31] <Cork> (in your code)
[07:30:43] <seutje> and try to log what ur trying to execute that method on
[07:31:21] <birdpoop> Hi, i have a page in which upon pressing a button you can collect a from using ajax, after having collected this form i want to post this form with ajax without refreshing the page.how can i do this?
[07:31:31] <Ownatik> Cork: I'm close to it
[07:31:43] <kborchers> ?ajax @ birdpoop
[07:31:43] <bot-t> birdpoop, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:34:58] <birdpoop> yes, but theres 2 things i dont understand: 1) the form is not on the original html document because it is retrieved using ajax, so how do i acces the element, 2) does this automatically cancel the default submit of the form?
[07:35:45] <hariom> How to wait for a function to set a global variable? I have a function which fire's a dialog box. Dialog box has submit or cancel button. Both submit and cancel will set a variable. I need to wait for that variable to set in the  first function. How to do that?
[07:36:56] <kborchers> birdpoop: so you're getting the form via ajax, then do you add it to the page so someone can fill it out? then on submit of that form you want it to submit via ajax? am i understanding?
[07:38:50] <birdpoop> yes
[07:38:57] <birdpoop> exactly
[07:39:11] <hariom> How to wait for a function to set a global variable? I have a function which fire's a dialog box. Dialog box has submit and cancel buttons. Both submit and cancel will set a variable. I need to wait for that variable to get set to a particular value and then execute the remaining statements in first function. How to do that?
[07:39:32] <jomofcw> How could I easily get each node that have the attribute title or the attribute alt, or both of it ? getting each element only once. i.e. in the case of an <img alt="foo" title="bar"/> I want to iterate this only once, not to get it twice as I have using ->find('[title]')->add('[alt]').
[07:40:30] <kborchers> birdpoop: ok, so after you add that form to the dom, you can set its onsubmit to call a function that serializes its values and then submits via ajax. then be sure to return false from that function to prevent the default submit action. make sense?
[07:41:26] <birdpoop> yep pretty much, only 1 thing
[07:41:39] <gnarf> jomofcw: $("[alt],[title]") but its a slow ass selector, requiring searching every element -- consider using a class or a tagname
[07:41:54] <jomofcw> gnarf OK thanks !
[07:42:53] <hariom> jomofcw: First try title and set a flag. if flag is set don't find for alt. Try something on this line. Else good thing is to have dummy class.
[07:43:19] <jomofcw> OK hariom i'll try too.
[07:44:30] <fai> hi
[07:44:46] <birdpoop> how do i change the onsubmit? i cant just put it in a doc.ready because then it will execute before the form is loaded....
[07:45:27] <kborchers> ?submit @ birdpoop

[07:46:41] <birdpoop> it will catch the submit even when the element was not available when the page loaded? i did not know that ty
[07:47:03] <kborchers> birdpoop: no, you must bind that after you add the form to the dom
[07:47:20] <fai> I created a json editor , and add that to the plugin.
[07:47:26] <fai> it is call simple json editor
[07:47:35] <fai> it is linked to http://plugins.jquery.com/project/simplejsoneditor
[07:47:59] <fai> but I can't search it http://plugins.jquery.com/
[07:48:20] <fai> how do I make it so anyone can search it on plugins.jquery.com
[07:48:30] <birdpoop> thats what i figured, but how? can i use it in combination with the live() function perhaps?

[07:51:30] <hariom> I have an interesting case to solve. My dialog box is just a div with 'Submit' and 'Cancel' buttons. One of the function in my program display's this div and make the background overlayed so it appear that the div is a dialog box. This dialog is a login form. When submit or cancel click events occur and performs their tasks, I need to run the remaining statements from the first function (the one which displayed this div (or login form) ). How this can be a

[07:53:30] <seutje> fai: what's the point of this? o.O
[07:54:03] <fai> I want to make my plugin available to search on plugins.jquery.com
[07:54:23] <mbrevda> in php, to add an array to an array, you can do this: http://pastebin.com/p57KCYfm . What is the equivalent in javascript for objects?
[07:54:39] <entr> quick qn. Is there a way to pass a mousedown event to element's parent (which is jqueryui sortable item) so that the actual sorting starts?
[07:55:08] <seutje> fai: oooh, I see, my bad
[07:55:34] <fai> right now, even if I search "json editor", it won't show my plugin
[07:55:40] <mythmon> how can i take a bunch of elements (trs) and sort them by some text in one part of it? (a td)
[07:55:40] <fai> and I want to figure out how
[07:56:05] <birdpoop> http://pastie.org/2231999, in which data = the form and elmt is the container div. function is called onclick
[07:56:14] <fai> do you have any ideas??
[07:56:16] <kborchers> entr: i believe the mousedown should bubble to the parent already unless you are preventing it
[07:56:44] <birdpoop> url returns an <form></form>
[07:56:59] <hashnuke> hey al.
[07:57:00] <hashnuke> *all
[07:57:06] <PoveStop> hi
[07:57:14] <seutje> fai: wait for cron to run
[07:57:38] <seutje> or, considering it runs a D6, trigger it urself :D
[07:57:42] <fai> but I submitted that for more than 10 days
[07:58:21] <kborchers> birdpoop: ok, so then you can do something like $(elmt form).submit(function() {...}); right after you add it to the dom there.
[07:58:32] <hashnuke> I've bound a change event to a file input element. Is there a way to get the file object after the user selects the file?
[07:58:42] <entr> kborchers: i have actually done that! :) but to stop the image (That's my extra handler i'm talking about) from being dragged. That's defaults FF behavior if it's not prevented, right?
[07:59:38] <Anticom> is there a simpler way to navigate down the dom instead of using e.g. .children().children().children().children().children()... ?
[07:59:58] <kborchers> entr: i'm a little confused can you show me? see ?demo
[07:59:58] <bot-t> entr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:00:23] <fai> @anticom: use    jquery( this ).filter( ".search_class" )
[08:00:43] <kborchers> Anticom: it depends on your situation. you can use .find(), .filter() or some other selector
[08:00:50] <Anticom> so .filter() is recursivley going down the dom?
[08:01:08] <Anticom> thanks guys (:
[08:01:08] <birdpoop> ok ty kborchers i will try that;)
[08:01:38] <erichynds> no, filter() doesn't go down the DOM
[08:01:39] <erichynds> find() does
[08:01:46] <erichynds> ^ Anticom

[08:03:20] <kborchers> erichynds: NL_Ed was trying to get ahold of you a bit ago about your multiselect plugin.
[08:03:42] <erichynds> o rly
[08:04:43] <NL_Ed> Hi erichynds, can I PM?
[08:04:56] <kborchers> erichynds: also, scott_gonzalez the UI development lead asked that you not refer to it as the jQuery UI multiselect widget as that causes confusion about whether or not it is actually part of jQuery UI
[08:06:00] <NL_Ed> It does use UI kborchers for like theming
[08:06:33] <kborchers> NL_Ed: right, but it is not part of UI which is the confusion
[08:06:53] <NL_Ed> yer, probs should be UI compatible or something along those lines
[08:07:31] <kborchers> NL_Ed: erichynds: a multiselect widget is in development for UI as we speak http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138021/Multiselect
[08:08:10] <NL_Ed> kborchers: I've seen that, it wasn't exactly what we wanted, we needed it was a dropdown
[08:08:23] <erichynds> kborchers: that isn't in development by the jquery ui team
[08:08:30] <el_bb> I am getting an object using $('#mycheckbox'). but when I try myobj.checked it is undefined??
[08:09:20] <erichynds> kborchers: also, that's a dupe of http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138020/MultiCheckboxPicker
[08:10:45] <Kambfhase> ?p @ el_bb
[08:10:45] <bot-t> el_bb, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:11:10] <kborchers> erichynds: either way, scott_gonzalez just asked that you not refer to it as the jQuery UI Multiselect Widget as it is not supported by the UI team. that was the main point. just relaying the message ;)
[08:12:00] <erichynds> yeah, makes sense
[08:13:09] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Can you help me now? :P
[08:13:16] <erichynds> oh yeah
[08:13:18] <erichynds> waht's up?
[08:13:34] <NL_Ed> im trying to get certain things to show/hide depending on what's selected
[08:13:38] <StyXLT> hi, i'm using jquery 1.6.2, and i keep getting an error Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=~"domain"]
[08:13:54] <NL_Ed> I've kind of got it working but it only hides the thing if they all get unchecked
[08:14:04] <StyXLT> it should be working however it doesn't
[08:14:08] <erichynds> NL_Ed: jsfiddle or a pastie?
[08:14:15] <Snugug> How do I cycle over each child element of a given element and change each child's width?
[08:14:21] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Yer one second
[08:14:36] <StyXLT> Snugug use each(function(){ your code });
[08:14:41] <Kambfhase> StyXLT: try [name~="domain"]
[08:15:03] <Assimilater> 'morning everyone
[08:15:17] <Snugug> StyXLT: Right, I've got this and it isn't working: http://pastebin.com/VPaXr4Xf
[08:15:59] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Just tidying it up so its easier for you to read
[08:16:16] <Kambfhase> Snugug: index is a number!
[08:16:42] <jeffsmykil> how do i send a click via the firebug console?
[08:16:43] <Snugug> Kambfhase: Ahh! Bah! Okay, so clearly I'm not quite understanding jQuery's each syntax
[08:17:02] <Kambfhase> Snugug: try this: http://pastebin.com/1KUURSXM
[08:17:05] <Snugug> Or I'm just plain silly
[08:17:21] <Kambfhase> jQuery does not have syntax. its pure sematics ;)
[08:17:21] <Snugug> Kambfhase: Yah, duh, I'm silly. Let me try
[08:17:22] <NL_Ed> erichynds: http://pastebin.com/wyA1u7Sm
[08:17:36] <Snugug> Kambfhase: details details
[08:17:42] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:17:53] <erichynds> NL_Ed: 1 sec
[08:18:15] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: sending a click via the firebug console?  $('element').click ?
[08:18:25] <Kambfhase> $('element').click()
[08:18:32] <jeffsmykil> ty
[08:18:33] <Kambfhase> but why do you ask ME?
[08:18:43] <jeffsmykil> you're smart and you answer
[08:18:49] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:19:19] <Snugug> Kambfhase: That didn't seem to work. Might be because some js somewhere else is overriding it, but I don't think so
[08:19:37] <Kambfhase> is you page live?
[08:19:41] <jeffsmykil> so if i add something to the dom ton document ready via javascript is there anything saying i cant later trigger an event with that element?
[08:19:51] <Snugug> Kambfhase: No it's not, I'm deving
[08:20:11] <jeffsmykil> actually no im adding it on a click event
[08:20:31] <StyXLT> Snugug try using .css('width',newWidth)
[08:20:37] <NL_Ed> np erichynds
[08:20:50] <Snugug> StyXLT: Will do
[08:20:56] <Kambfhase> Snugug: please paste your basic html plus JS to jsfiddle.net or try StyXLTs answer
[08:22:07] <Snugug> Kambfhase: I've got it working. The .children().each() isn't working, but selecting the elements directly and changing their width/height works fine
[08:22:19] <Kambfhase> mkay
[08:22:31] <Snugug> Weird. Whatever. Thanks for the help though

[08:23:55] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: can I not have a click event associated to an element that is created via .append on a different click event?
[08:24:09] <Kambfhase> yes you can
[08:24:19] <jeffsmykil> hrm wtf am i doing wrong
[08:24:30] <Kambfhase> paste?
[08:24:40] <jeffsmykil> cant even get the click to trigger a breakpoint
[08:24:46] <PoveStop> what about trying .live
[08:24:54] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: that would take some work, if i have to i will
[08:24:54] <ravenzz> try with live('click',function(){ /* ... */ });
[08:24:58] <ravenzz> instead of click
[08:25:02] <jeffsmykil> whats that?
[08:25:08] <jeffsmykil> never usef live
[08:25:10] <jeffsmykil> looks scary
[08:25:14] <ravenzz> ok PoveStop won the race :P
[08:25:14] <ravenzz> lol

[08:26:18] <PoveStop> jeffsmykil, http://api.jquery.com/live
[08:26:34] <ravenzz> Snugug you can't. you should the youtube APIs to control the player/video

[08:32:03] <StyXLT> guys, i'm trying to change the name of the selected radio button from domain1, domain2 etc to domain on the form submit but $('input[name~="domain"]:checked').attr('name','domain'); doesn't work
[08:32:21] <StyXLT> any ideaS?
[08:32:25] <armetiz> Hi there
[08:32:30] <armetiz> I'm new user of jQuery
[08:32:50] <BlaDe^> styol name~= ?
[08:32:59] <armetiz> I'm using jQuery to do some validation on a form
[08:33:03] <armetiz> it's working very well
[08:33:25] <StyXLT> BlaDe^ sorry, what?
[08:33:34] <BlaDe^>  $('input[name~="domain"]:checked')
[08:33:40] <BlaDe^> your selector is name~=, read it.
[08:33:48] <armetiz> but now, I want to add a Js code when the form is validate.. I have found the "submitHandler" but the function isn't call at all..
[08:34:03] <StyXLT> well it has to be name
[08:34:11] <armetiz> And if I'm override the submit () function, the form isn't validate
[08:34:18] <armetiz> do you have any clue ?
[08:34:39] <StyXLT> armetiz first let us see the code
[08:35:19] <StyXLT> BlaDe^: it has to be name, because the radio button groups have names like domain1, domain2 etc
[08:35:32] <BlaDe^> but why the ~
[08:35:42] <Kambfhase> BlaDe^: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/
[08:35:47] <keir> i think its the curly line that hes asking about :P
[08:36:09] <Kambfhase> StyXLT: fuck, didnt notice earlier: use :selected instead of :checked
[08:36:10] <StyXLT> Kambfhase thanks for answering that for me :)
[08:36:16] <ravenzz> BlaDe^ http://jsfiddle.net/v5Jax/ ?
[08:36:25] <BlaDe^> i've always used .filter(function() { this.match(/.../) } for that
[08:36:30] <BlaDe^> oops.
[08:36:34] <StyXLT> :))
[08:37:00] <el_bb> how can i modify GET parameters for a subsequent reload?
[08:37:06] <BlaDe^> ravenzz sort of but hold on
[08:38:55] <StyXLT> Kambfhase check this: http://jsfiddle.net/Esx8Q/
[08:39:19] <ravenzz> BlaDe^ this is better http://jsfiddle.net/v5Jax/1/
[08:39:20] <StyXLT> i think the problem is that i overwrite the form element on submit instead of before submit
[08:39:52] <Kambfhase> could be, not sure
[08:40:13] <StyXLT> how do i sort it out then? it's giving me a headache
[08:40:14] <sphinxxx> anyone know how i can get this slideshow to stop at the last slide ? http://www.nautiandco.com/   using jquery plugin http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/
[08:41:15] <BlaDe^> ravenzz nope :P
[08:41:34] <Kambfhase> what are you trying to do anywas?
[08:41:49] <StyXLT> me? :D
[08:42:30] <BlaDe^> Kambfhase me?
[08:42:41] <ravenzz> BlaDe^ nope, what?
[08:43:07] <StyXLT> in my app i want the users to select the categories of certain domain names, e.g. health and they can choose a domain name from that cat
[08:43:23] <BlaDe^> ravenzz: this is the sort of solution I want: http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/2/
[08:43:27] <BlaDe^> elegant :)
[08:43:40] <BlaDe^> but I want to replace name1 with name2, etc, but again, neat
[08:43:45] <StyXLT> since i'm using zend-framework i can only create radio button groups with different names
[08:44:02] <StyXLT> so first group is domain1, second is domain2 and etc.
[08:44:03] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Don't want to rush you but are you back?
[08:44:11] <StyXLT> bit on the form submit
[08:44:14] <StyXLT> but*
[08:44:15] <erichynds> NL_Ed: yeah u get my fiddle?

[08:44:20] <ravenzz> BlaDe^ yah if you clone. you will have the same IDs
[08:44:30] <hashnuke> in a jQuery event I'm getting the file object of a file input: e.target.files[0] is the file object. When I try to createObjectURL using this object, it throws an error: window.URL.createObjectURL(e.target.files[0]). Anybody know why that happens? I'm on Chrome 13 beta
[08:44:36] <StyXLT> i need to change the selected domain like domain2 into just domain
[08:44:43] <BlaDe^> ravenzz yeah exactly
[08:44:51] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Nope I didn't see it come through
[08:44:54] <BlaDe^> i'm hoping for a nice .filter or something to take care of it for me
[08:45:47] <phishbor> <3 <3 handlebars.js
[08:45:54] <Me-Selfe> Anyone tried to dynamic load the facebook comments social plugin?
[08:46:08] <kasunLak> hi all, I am doing ajax post to a sever with username and password to authenticate in the firebug I can see the correct response code 201 but it never calls success function. Any help?
[08:46:17] <StyXLT> Me-Selfe: you mean use ajax to fetch the fb content?
[08:47:32] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Here is the actual text, it might help you realise what I need it to do http://jsfiddle.net/q8u5k/
[08:47:48] <phishbot> anyone ever use handlebars.js in a production environment?
[08:48:05] <Gooorf_PC> http://pastebin.com/u3DaBa5p      error I'm getting is uncaught identifier @ $("#storepanel").html(data.html);   but when i check the dom, the div is there. could it be that the ajax query is happening before the div is created?
[08:48:06] <phishbot> i mean.. sorry let me rephrase that
[08:48:47] <kborchers[A]> kasunLak: i'm not sure if .ajax() sees 201 as success, may only accept 200. if that is the case you could use the statusCode option and define a function to run on 201
[08:48:51] <NL_Ed> Infact erichynds it should be this one http://jsfiddle.net/q8u5k/2/ so it's hidden at the start
[08:48:57] <erichynds> NL_Ed gotcha
[08:49:22] <Me-Selfe> StyXLT: no, there is a social plugin to get comments on your page.. The problem is that i want to load it dynamicly...
[08:49:41] <blacksoul> hello, how is it possible to add a 'global' function to the autocomplete UI? ... so i have 3 fields. the autocomplete list should be always the same, but each field needs to send a specific parameter via a ajax request ; e.g.: getUser ..and i want to get the user by firstname, lastname OR username
[08:49:54] <aca20031> any ops may wanna rejoin and then kick evaa for advertising a webcam show >.>
[08:50:19] <NL_Ed> erichynds: You can see it works if you tick temporary etc but if you untick it doesn't hide
[08:50:59] <CyborgShadow> Morning everyone. I've got a question about converting some javascript to Jquery for use with crossrider.
[08:51:19] <kborchers> blacksoul: so you're loading the list via ajax and want it to pull based on what is in the three fields, right?
[08:51:40] <hariom> I have downloaded customized jquery ui. When I unzipped the file, I got development-bundled directory along with js directory. In js directory I have jquery ui custom 1.8.14 .js file. Should I place this single file in my project javascript folder? Will that get all the function I need in my customized UI?
[08:52:01] <CyborgShadow> I've got a page with an object called Header, and a function that auto-resizes the Header to page width on window.focus via a function. The javascript line that resizes the "Header" element is: document.getElementById('Header').style.width = '100%';
[08:52:15] <NL_Ed> yes, it creates the file with your custom options hariom
[08:52:18] <CyborgShadow> It doesn't work in Jquery with the syntax I've tried... $('Header').css('width', '100%');
[08:52:38] <CyborgShadow> I get back "Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'css'
[08:52:52] <ryanneufeld> CyborgShadow: there is no Header element
[08:52:53] <BlaDe^> ravenzz I want something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/4/ but it's giving a syntax error
[08:53:17] <hariom> NL_Ed: what is the user of development-bundled directory and inside it minified, theme etc directory?
[08:53:20] <blacksoul> kborchers: nearly, i dont have any code yet... i have 3 fields, each have to do the request at getuser.php?(several other parameter)&firstname=... and i want to write this ajax call not 3 times with firstname= lastname= and username= but only 1 time 'global', so that i can reach it from every autocomplete part
[08:53:31] <CyborgShadow> ryannefeld: How do you say so? It finds the object...
[08:53:58] <CyborgShadow> ryannefeld: If I tried $('#Header').css({'width': '100%'}); for example I get back TypeError: Cannot call method 'css' of null which would make me believe there's no Header.
[08:54:03] <NL_Ed> hariom: Dev isn't minified
[08:54:05] <sadmicrowave> anybody know if .parent() has a value for number of iterations to equate .parent().parent().parent() to .parent(3) and make my chains shorter?
[08:54:08] <blacksoul> kborchers: i dont know if i can do source: functioN(request, response) { ...}  also source: callGetUser(request, response) and define 'callGetUser' somewhere global
[08:54:59] <blacksoul> (so instead of source: function(re..)
[08:55:08] <NL_Ed> hariom:  If you chose themes the themes will be in the folders correspondingly
[08:55:08] <hariom> NL_Ed: Well I said inside development-bundled directory there is minified directory. (development-bundled -> UI -> minified).
[08:55:31] <hariom> what is the use of these directories?
[08:55:46] <pngl> Is it possible to get the URL of the request from the jqXHR object?
[08:55:53] <ryanneufeld> CyborgShadow: what does your html look like?
[08:56:03] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ CyborgShadow
[08:56:03] <bot-t> CyborgShadow, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:56:21] <NL_Ed> hariom: Not 100% sure I have never used the dev one
[08:56:37] <hariom> k
[08:56:45] <BlaDe^> can anyone see why this has a syntax error? http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/4/
[08:57:42] <Kambfhase> BlaDe^: JSHint.com can
[08:57:43] <kborchers> blacksoul: define callGetUser(type, val) where type is firstname, lastname or username and val is the value for that item. then in autocomplete define source: function(request, response) {...} in each of the autocompletes and inside that function call callGetUser with the appropriate vars. make sense?
[08:58:17] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: you have an extra }
[08:58:30] <jeffsmykil> can you do an append fade?
[08:58:48] <PoveStop> append fade?
[08:58:51] <BlaDe^> where ryanneufeld ?
[08:59:00] <BlaDe^> 3 opens, 3 closes
[08:59:00] <jeffsmykil> ah if i hide it first i can
[08:59:04] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense
[08:59:07] <PoveStop> heh
[08:59:11] <BlaDe^> Kambfhase it tells me the same as my browser..
[08:59:15] <blacksoul> kborchers: yes, and how to return the callGetUser result back to the auto complete? so $.get{ ... success: ???? }
[08:59:21] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: use the syntax highlighting...
[08:59:23] <NL_Ed> erichynds: I'm thinking it somehow needs to loop through each of the values and see if any of the right ones are checked
[09:00:03] <Anticom> how do i get the id of the selected dom element?
[09:00:19] <Anticom> is attr() the most simple way??
[09:00:38] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld I can see theres 3 { and 3 } .....
[09:00:55] <PoveStop> Anticom, $(this).attr('id') yes
[09:00:57] <ryanneufeld> k, then you're missing a ');'
[09:01:02] <Anticom> PoveStop kay
[09:01:14] <BlaDe^> why is everyone telling me the same as my browser ?
[09:01:23] <kborchers> blacksoul: remember how you have function(request, response) {... you pass response as the success callback to get and it will pass your data which should probably be json formatted to autocomplete
[09:01:27] <hariom> I have added custom jquery UI which has dialog box dependency satisfied. But when I do something like this: $("#dialog").dialog() nothing happens.
[09:01:27] <BlaDe^> if you don't know the problem don't give me silly answers
[09:01:36] <CyborgShadow> http://jsfiddle.net/3VFD8/
[09:01:47] <kborchers> blacksoul: so it might be better to use getJSON instead of get
[09:02:45] <blacksoul> kborchers: ok, when i fail, i will come back :)
[09:02:48] <blacksoul> thanks for help
[09:02:51] <kborchers> blacksoul: so probably also have to redefine callGetUser(type, val, response)
[09:02:55] <hariom> I have added custom jquery UI which has dialog box dependency satisfied. But when I do something like this: $("#dialog").dialog() nothing happens.
[09:02:55] <motaka2> does javascript have something like php implode?
[09:03:06] <erichynds> NL_Ed: this is really shitty code because i'm in a hurry (got a meeting)
[09:03:10] <erichynds> NL_Ed: but it works http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/q8u5k/3/
[09:03:14] <blacksoul> kborchers: of course, yes, so thanks :)
[09:03:25] <hashnuke> ah ok so window.URL.createObjectURL doesn't in chrome 13 but works in FF5.
[09:04:10] <erichynds> NL_Ed: basically checks to see if the checked value is one that should show the box, and if other checkboxes that should show the box are checked or not
[09:04:16] <erichynds> NL_Ed: to hide or show the box
[09:04:19] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Its perfect mate, I've gotta go now too :), so it loops through the array
[09:04:24] <erichynds> yeah
[09:04:28] <NL_Ed> nice one
[09:04:31] <NL_Ed> :D
[09:04:40] <NL_Ed> Thanks mate
[09:04:44] <NL_Ed> Awesome plugin
[09:04:45] <erichynds> np
[09:04:46] <erichynds> thx
[09:04:54] <NL_Ed> We've got it all over the site
[09:05:01] <erichynds> nice!
[09:05:19] <NL_Ed> Is it just the js I need, as far as I can tell that's all
[09:05:42] <erichynds> correct
[09:06:16] <NL_Ed> Mate I can't thank you enough, you may see a donation tonight depends how im feeling :p
[09:06:28] <erichynds> lol don't worry about it
[09:06:40] <NL_Ed> Brill Just implemented and it works :)
[09:06:47] <CyborgShadow> Anyone mind sharing how to convert this line of javascript to JQuery?  document.getElementById('Header').style.width = '100%';
[09:07:01] <NL_Ed> Cya
[09:07:02] <Kambfhase> why would you want to do that?
[09:07:13] <alexwait> Anyone know if I can using jQuery.link() and have it bind to elements whose name is "someName.qualifierHere"
[09:07:18] <alexwait> when the data object represents this structure
[09:07:29] <CyborgShadow> Kambfhase: I'm writing something for crossrider which suggests all code be in JQuery instead of raw javascript.
[09:07:48] <alexwait> For instance I have "someObject.objectA". It templates ok when I do ${someObject.objectA} but when I make the name someObject.objectA
[09:07:53] <alexwait> the linking does not occur
[09:08:09] <CyborgShadow> Kambfhase: But I'm a little more familiar with YUI, traditional JS, and ext-JS myself....not so much JQuery
[09:08:32] <Kambfhase> mkay, if they say so. try $('#Header').width('100%')
[09:09:43] <kborchers> CyborgShadow: Kambfhase: don't think you can do % there, try $("#Header").css("width", "100%");
[09:10:03] <Kambfhase> yeah, wasnt sure about that.
[09:10:34] <kborchers> CyborgShadow: Kambfhase: actually, maybe it does ;P sorry
[09:10:40] <CyborgShadow> $("#Header").css("width", "100%");
[09:10:40] <CyborgShadow> TypeError: Cannot call method 'css' of null
[09:10:41] <CyborgShadow> $("Header").css("width", "100%");
[09:10:41] <CyborgShadow> TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'css'
[09:11:02] <Kambfhase> you didnt load jQ properly or $ is taken by something else
[09:11:11] <sadmicrowave> Guys, I'm looking for a way to check on !$(this), is this possible? does $(this) allow me to do this?
[09:11:16] <alexwait> anyone have any ideas? :D
[09:11:18] <kborchers> CyborgShadow: or Header doesn't exist
[09:11:20] <Kambfhase> try jQuer('#Header') instea
[09:11:23] <sadmicrowave> here is what I'm talking about
[09:11:26] <CyborgShadow> kborchers: I know header exists.
[09:11:27] <Kambfhase> try jQuery('#Header') instea
[09:11:31] <sadmicrowave> http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/7KsCh/
[09:11:42] <Kambfhase> sadmicrowave: use .length
[09:11:45] <kborchers> CyborgShadow: are you doing on dom ready?
[09:12:24] <alexwait> I think my question was lost in the IRC chat scroll ><
[09:12:25] <CyborgShadow> kborchers: live debugging right now. later it's appended through YUI to a function called from window.focus and window.resize
[09:12:38] <Kambfhase> ?not @ sadmicrowave
[09:12:39] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[09:12:53] <kasunLak> kborchers: I tried to define a function under 201 code but still it's calling to error if you can please have a look into this http://www.pastie.org/2232377
[09:13:28] <BlaDe^> can anyone see why my replace doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/9/
[09:13:56] <kborchers> CyborgShadow: hmmm, try Kambfhase's suggestion to use jQuery instead of $. something is up with jQuery and using along with YUI could be fun
[09:14:38] <CyborgShadow> kborchers: I think he hit the hammer dead on the nail actually. +1 for Kambfhase.
[09:15:49] <kborchers> kasunLak: you are missing a ' in your alert. also, can you use firebug or something to see what exactly is coming back from your url? see ?alert
[09:16:18] * kborchers splashes cold water on bot-t
[09:17:35] <kborchers> bot-t: hey
[09:18:02] <BlaDe^> any ideas about my jsfiddle guys?
[09:19:03] <compufreak> What's the key combo to jump to the same spot on the next line (same tag)? It works in Notepad++ and I think TextMate
[09:19:38] <Kambfhase> BlaDe^: i am looking, but its weird
[09:19:49] <BlaDe^> Kambfhase what do you mean weird?
[09:20:04] <Kambfhase> weird as in WHAT THE FUCK?
[09:20:07] <BlaDe^> why?
[09:20:10] <kasunLak> kborchers: this is the response I am getting http://www.pastie.org/2232402
[09:20:10] <kborchers> BlaDe^: what are you using on the back end, PHP?
[09:20:16] <BlaDe^> kborchers yeah
[09:20:37] <BlaDe^> i could refactor to [] but it'd be a lot of rewriting
[09:20:45] <kborchers> BlaDe^: you could just name them as name[], email[], coment[] and then sort out the array on that end
[09:20:58] <BlaDe^> i'd rather just fix (hopefully) a small bug in this js
[09:21:06] <Kambfhase> BlaDe^: this is kinda working but not really: http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/10/ its weird
[09:21:52] <BlaDe^> it's replacing the top 3 not the bottom 3
[09:22:04] <BlaDe^> need to replace on the cloned elements
[09:22:06] <Kambfhase> yeah
[09:22:21] <BlaDe^> why the /g modifier?
[09:22:27] <kborchers> kasunLak: can you log the status code in error handler to see what it sees. see if it says 201 there?
[09:23:11] <kborchers> kasunLak: should be available in that jqXHR object
[09:23:31] <plombardi> Has anyone used jquery DataTables plugin? I can't seem figure out how to pass in an array of objects. I thought the aData param would work, but it did nothing.
[09:23:45] <kborchers> kasunLak: actually, the definition for error is error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) so status is right there
[09:24:43] <Kambfhase> BlaDe^: http://jsfiddle.net/W2bTd/11/ buyakasha
[09:24:49] <Rushing> BlaDe^, i'd probably do it differently too, but your probably is that you're not changing the name on the right elements
[09:25:14] <Rushing> you're doing a .find() on the original elements you're cloning, not the clones
[09:25:18] <BlaDe^> good job Kambfhase :D
[09:25:24] <BlaDe^> Rushing you're correct that was the issue
[09:26:20] <_antant> #chromium
[09:27:28] <kasunLak> kborchers: It's log 'error' when I log it as console.log(textStatus);
[09:28:54] <kborchers> kasunLak: doh, that's what textStatus would be. the code should be available in the jqXHR object as jqXHR.status I believe
[09:29:21] <kasunLak> kborchers: sorry, wait I will see
[09:29:32] <kborchers> kasunLak: no, that was my fault
[09:30:21] <kasunLak> kborchers: Its 0??
[09:30:39] <kborchers> kasunLak: hmmm, that's really strange
[09:32:01] <kborchers> kasunLak: hmmm, are you requesting cross-site?
[09:32:26] <kasunLak> kborchers: yes
[09:32:50] <kborchers> ?sop @ kasunLak
[09:32:51] <bot-t> kasunLak, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[09:33:05] <kborchers> kasunLak: you need to use jsonp
[09:35:22] <kasunLak> kborchers: thank you, I was not aware that sop is there for post method also
[09:36:43] <kborchers> kasunLak: the post will most likely work but then the response would be blocked since it's from another domain
[09:37:28] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: unless the datatype is jsonp
[09:37:32] <ryanneufeld> then it will work
[09:37:40] <ryanneufeld> but only if the server supports jsonp
[09:37:41] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: right, that is what i told him to use
[09:37:48] <ryanneufeld> nice
[09:45:00] <compufreak> No one knows the jump between tags key combo?
[09:51:02] <ngharo> ctrl+] on vim :)
[09:51:25] <Ariel_Calzada> how to check if a cookie exists?
[09:51:28] <nvictor> hey
[09:51:29] <madprops> can I return a json responde from a .get call ?
[09:51:53] <madprops> and iterate through it like an array?
[09:51:53] <kborchers> ?getJSON @ madprops
[09:51:54] <bot-t> madprops, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[09:52:14] <Rushing> i think you can just specify it as the dataType too
[09:52:15] <nvictor> so i have an input field with a value="1" then i do $('input[name=myinput]')[0].value but then i get a wierd result, how's that
[09:52:33] <madprops> Rushing, can you point out how?
[09:52:59] <kborchers> ?get @ madprops
[09:53:00] <bot-t> madprops, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[09:53:26] <Rushing> nvictor, can you be more specific. "wierd result" is...not specific
[09:53:34] <nvictor> weird sorry
[09:53:48] <nvictor> Rushing: 29491200
[09:54:00] <nvictor> that's the value returned for value=1
[09:54:19] <Rushing> what does $(...).val() give you?
[09:54:19] <madprops> what's the difference between .ajax and .getJSON?
[09:54:38] <Rushing> madprops, .get, .post, .getJSON etc are all shortcuts for .ajax
[09:54:41] <nvictor> madprops: i assumer the latter gets a json
[09:54:56] <nvictor> -r
[09:54:59] <juria_roberts> How do I get the element which fired an event in the function?
[09:55:07] <Karen_m> the javascript on my site won't run on my phone's brower (opera), but works on all browers with mac/pc...  why is that... would jquery run properly?
[09:55:11] <kborchers> juria_roberts: event.target
[09:55:29] <Rushing> jurica, evt.target or this are the elements that fired the event
[09:56:13] <madprops> is there a hinder in speed when using json and not a simple response?
[09:56:41] <Rushing> madprops, really depends on the size of the json response and the size of a simple response
[09:56:49] <Rushing> either way, there is some processing that has to go on
[09:56:58] <Rushing> json is generally the most lightweight
[09:57:14] <Rushing> vs html, xml, etc
[09:57:30] <gnarf> text is fastest
[09:57:36] <gnarf> :)
[09:58:21] <madprops> what's better two calls to get text in each or a json one?
[09:58:30] <Rushing> one call with josn
[09:58:35] <Rushing> josn, not json
[09:58:40] <Rushing> O_o
[09:58:45] <madprops> lol
[10:00:24] <thm> how can I modify a form's params before calling submit()?
[10:00:48] <Rushing> var params = $("form").param(); params.thingy=thong;
[10:01:21] <sphinxxx> is there any way to get this to stop on the last slide (its on autoplay) http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/
[10:02:13] <Rushing> is it using jQuery.cycle?
[10:02:55] <Rushing> cycle has a loop option i believe, maybe autoLoop. any decent sequence plugin should...
[10:03:49] <nvictor> Rushing: quick question
[10:04:29] <nvictor> Rushing: i'm editing my input field but the javascript does not see the edited value
[10:04:39] <nvictor> isn't it the .value attribute?
[10:05:18] <Rushing> yes, the .value property, but if you want to set the value, i'd suggest using $(...).val("newvalue");
[10:05:23] <Rushing> ?val @ nvictor
[10:05:24] <bot-t> nvictor, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:06:10] <nvictor> Rushing: i was using val() before
[10:06:20] <nvictor> i need to get the current value displayed in the field
[10:06:31] <nvictor> not the one set by the value= attribute
[10:06:38] <sandstrom> What happens if I try to bind event handlers multiple times? Will that cause any trouble?
[10:07:01] <nvictor> .value, attr('value'), val() all return the current attribute
[10:07:06] <Rushing> nvictor, the display value and the .value property should be the same
[10:07:19] <nvictor> Rushing: they are not in my case :(
[10:07:27] <Rushing> i definitely wouldn't use attr("value").
[10:07:33] <jkoudys> Is there a lib (or builtin) that would try to guess the most efficient animation, then apply it? Example: you slide a div across the screen. If it detects the useragent's Chrome, it uses a webkit animation; firefox it uses a -moz anim, and if it's IE8 it just uses the regular jquery.animate() ?
[10:07:43] <Rushing> then you're doing it wrong :P
[10:07:43] <sandstrom> E.g. if I bind the same event handler $("div").bind('click', myHandler) 100 times. Will there be 100 handlers or is it smart enough not to bind again?
[10:07:56] <Rushing> i'd need to see the code to tell more
[10:08:05] <Karen_m> will a jquery submenu run on a phone browser??
[10:08:05] <Cork[home]> nvictor: your calling .val in keydown/up?`
[10:08:31] <Rushing> jkoudys, you could use jquery in combination with modernizr
[10:08:47] <Cork[home]> nvictor: cause if you do, your problem is expected
[10:09:00] <nvictor> Cork[home]: i haven't handled the keyboard events
[10:09:04] <Rushing> Karen_m, really depends on the phone. most webkit based browsers are pretty capable
[10:09:19] <Cork[home]> nvictor: in what situation are you trying to grab the value?
[10:09:22] <nvictor> Cork[home]: i am just getting these values when a button is clicked
[10:09:29] <Cork[home]> ah
[10:09:37] <Cork[home]> then .val should defenitly work
[10:09:38] <nvictor> Cork[home]: i am initiating an ajax call when a button is clicked
[10:09:45] <Cork[home]> nvictor: try reproduce it in jsfiddle
[10:09:47] <nvictor> hmm, then i'm doing it wrong
[10:09:53] <Cork[home]> ?p
[10:09:53] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:10:43] <Cork[home]> (it has jquery at the left in the dropdowns, and even support for face ajax responders
[10:10:45] <Cork[home]> )
[10:10:54] <Cork[home]> *fake
[10:13:32] <thm> Rushing: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'param'
[10:14:08] <thynctank> aloha folks. Any chance anyone knows of a good slider widget that doesn't depend on jQuery UI?
[10:14:20] <Rushing> ?param @ thm
[10:14:20] <bot-t> thm, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[10:14:22] <nvictor> and of course i can't reproduce it
[10:14:22] <thynctank> been searching for a bit and not turning up much
[10:14:28] <nvictor> http://jsfiddle.net/7hNpa/ seems to work fine
[10:14:51] <Cork[home]> :D
[10:15:07] <Cork[home]> time for regression research :)
[10:15:08] <Rushing> thm, you're probably running an older version of jquery. checkout the beforeSend callback on .ajax. you can manipulate the request data there too
[10:16:27] <winux> Would this simple 5 line script make an element with an id of "example1" turn red if a link is clicked? Pasted here: http://pastebin.com/D5kNr6Cb
[10:17:28] <jedimind> yes winux
[10:17:40] <winux> jedimind: odd, i cant get it to function properly
[10:17:43] <jedimind> though you might want to prevent the anchor from actually going to the URL
[10:18:01] <jedimind> otherwise you wont see it happen, and the anchor that's clicked on will just load the page it's linked to
[10:18:06] <jedimind> is that what's happening ?
[10:18:10] <winux> jedimind: yea I have taken care of it
[10:18:32] <winux> jedimind: the link stays the same.. im using it within a CMS, although other jquery ive tried (alert box on click) has worked
[10:18:33] <jedimind> $('a').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); .... })
[10:18:45] <winux> not the link, but the text with id example1
[10:19:06] <jedimind> the other thing is, if that anchor your'e clicking on does not exist when the page loads (ie, if it was added to the DOM later via javascript) then your click event will not bind to it
[10:19:09] <jedimind> you have to use .live instead
[10:19:20] <jedimind> and that's all i can give you without you pasting a url to a more complete example
[10:19:30] <jedimind> you can use jsfiddle to create a testcase
[10:19:51] <winux> jedimind: oh that is cool, thanks for the resource
[10:20:14] <jedimind> its the same thing just .live('click', function() { .... });
[10:20:38] <jedimind> though i would warn against using a vague selector like 'a' for .live
[10:20:42] <winux> jedimind: .live, not sure what it does? ill have to look that up
[10:20:44] <jedimind> in the event you have hundreds of anchors on the page
[10:21:05] <jedimind> live basically persistently binds an event to an element, so if you add new anchors on the page after the page is loaded
[10:21:09] <winux> jedimind: yea ill specify which anchor later
[10:21:12] <jedimind> it will look out for them and bind the event to them
[10:21:18] <PoveStop> .live puts an event on all elements specified even if they appear in the future
[10:21:19] <winux> ah i see
[10:21:38] <erichynds> taht is not correct
[10:21:49] <erichynds> live puts one event listener on the document
[10:21:53] <erichynds> not on each element
[10:22:16] <erichynds> when the event bubbles up to the document, jquery checks whether the element matches a selector bound w/ live(), and if so fires the handler
[10:22:27] <gnarf> erichynds: it proxies that event listener to the element tho :)
[10:22:51] <erichynds> after it matches though
[10:23:20] <gnarf> there was someone in #jqueryui-dev earlier looking for support from jQuery UI Multiselect ;)
[10:23:31] <erichynds> yeah i helped him earlier :)
[10:23:38] <gnarf> coo
[10:23:41] <gnarf> didn't see that
[10:23:54] <jedimind> erichynds, wouldn't there still be a performance hit on vague selectors ?
[10:23:58] <winux> so instead of using .ready, use .live
[10:24:09] <nvictor> oooh
[10:24:11] <nvictor> :O
[10:24:37] <erichynds> jedimind: umm i dunno, probably if the browser doesn't have matchesSelector and the selector has to be parsed by sizzle
[10:24:38] <erichynds> but
[10:24:43] <erichynds> i'm talking 100% out of my ass
[10:24:49] <erichynds> so don't quote me :)
[10:24:51] <gnarf> jedimind: what is "vague" ?
[10:24:52] <jedimind> fair enough
[10:24:58] <jedimind> gnarf, $('a')
[10:25:15] <winux> out of curiosity, is there a case in which .ready is used over .live?
[10:25:22] <gnarf> jedimind: thats actually very specific
[10:25:26] <gnarf> :)
[10:25:40] <gnarf> jedimind: you have a few points of "perf" when dealing with live
[10:25:43] <gnarf> a) time to bind
[10:26:09] <winux> ah
[10:26:29] <gnarf> $( selector ).live( type, fn ) will always search for "selector"
[10:26:35] <gnarf> even tho it doesn't need it
[10:26:58] <gnarf> but in the case of $("a") its a pretty quick selector
[10:27:11] <gnarf> b) the amount of other events that fire
[10:27:45] <gnarf> so like - if you bind a live event, an event handler is called for ALL (non stopPropagate()d) events of that type on the page
[10:28:34] <gnarf> its job is basicaly checking $(e.target).closest(selector)
[10:28:45] <gnarf> against each live event of that type
[10:28:57] <thm> does sb know what the best way is to call a function when the contents of a datetime element has been changed?
[10:29:11] <gnarf> thm: wtf is a datetime element? :)
[10:29:35] <thm> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/datetime
[10:29:41] <thm> that one.
[10:30:05] <gnarf> couldn't tell you - never used it
[10:30:14] <gnarf> but i imagine it has an event
[10:30:50] <gnarf> and yet another example of someone naming a widget "jQuery UI ....."
[10:31:48] <jedimind> gnarf, cool, that makes sense
[10:32:04] <jedimind> i guess in my mind searching for all anchors in the event you have 3000 anchors on the page
[10:32:08] <gnarf> thm: seems you can bind the "change" event via the ui options
[10:32:13] <nvictor> how do i get the mimetype of the response sent back from an ajax request?
[10:32:23] <jedimind> would be a big hit on performance, but i guess it's not that big a deal
[10:32:51] <gnarf> jedimind: document.getElementById("a") is fast
[10:33:06] <gnarf> er
[10:33:06] <gnarf> sry
[10:33:10] <Rushing> i wish you could emulate IE8- speed with IE9 developer tools :/
[10:33:11] <gnarf> getElementsByTagName
[10:33:47] <gnarf> jedimind: browsers seem to store a good searchable tree for ID/Class/TagName
[10:34:20] <jedimind> right but i meant more in the even of .live
[10:34:23] <gnarf> i think ".className" is actually slower than "a"
[10:34:44] <gnarf> jedimind: i think there is a bit of a perf hit in jQuery selection of large groups
[10:34:44] <jedimind> say you're doing endless scroll in an app, and you're pulling 100 records each time, and with each one you have to attach an anchor for a "delete" or "edit" functionality or something
[10:34:48] <gnarf> but i don't think it is
[10:34:57] <jedimind> so on each addition to the DOM of 100x2 new anchors
[10:35:05] <gnarf> live wont care
[10:35:11] <gnarf> live doesn't care about the new stuff
[10:35:12] <jedimind> ok good to know
[10:35:17] <Rushing> gnarf, jquery uses the getElementByID/getElementsByTagName etc
[10:35:20] <blacksoul> is it possible to skip [data] at getJSON and just define a callback function or give the reference of a function ?
[10:35:34] <jedimind> what do you mean doesnt care about the new stuff? does it not have to actively attach events to the new anchors
[10:35:39] <gnarf> jedimind: no
[10:35:42] <jedimind> if you have $('a').live soemthing
[10:35:51] <gnarf> jedimind: it catches the event while it bubbles to the document
[10:35:55] <jedimind> ah
[10:36:03] <gnarf> or while it propagates
[10:36:09] <gnarf> never remember which term is the more appropriate
[10:36:21] <gnarf> the actual "eventListner" is bound to document
[10:36:24] <coachz> Is there jQuery UI css file on CDN ?
[10:36:34] <gnarf> coachz: google has one i believe
[10:36:40] <coachz> yeah can't find a url
[10:37:06] <gnarf> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:37:17] <coachz> thanks !
[10:37:31] <gnarf> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/redmond/jquery-ui.css
[10:39:11] <phishbot> is there a handlebars js irc chanenl?
[10:41:21] <Rushing> phishbot, i've never heard of handlebars. it look slike jQuery.template though...is it different?
[10:42:22] <phishbot> it's a superset of the features available in Mustache (if you've heard of it)
[10:42:28] <phishbot> yes it's very similar to jQuery Templates
[10:44:30] <sandstrom> How do I get the json data from within myHandler(data, textResponse, xhr) in a jQuery.ajax("/my/path", {dataType:"json", success:myHandler}) request?
[10:46:54] <nvictor> how to disable a form onsubmit?
[10:47:13] <nvictor> .onsubmit(function(){return false;}) is not working
[10:47:22] <nvictor> the enter key stills send the form info
[10:47:31] <danheberden> ?.submit @ nvictor
[10:47:32] <bot-t> nvictor, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[10:47:40] <nvictor> bot-t: thanks
[10:47:40] * bot-t sighs
[10:47:52] <danheberden> also, instead of return false, use preventDefault
[10:48:01] <Rushing> nvictor, function(evt){ evt.preventDefault() }
[10:48:02] <danheberden> .submit( function( event ) { event.preventDefault(); } );
[10:48:17] <nvictor> oh about preventDefault
[10:48:20] <danheberden> Rushing _o/ \o_
[10:48:22] <Kambfhase> sandstrom: its the first parameter to your function
[10:48:30] <Rushing> :P
[10:48:40] <nvictor> it does not work for the link that has #
[10:48:44] <nvictor> as href
[10:48:51] <nvictor> the # is still added to the url
[10:49:08] <Rushing> preventDefault and return false for those
[10:49:23] <sandstrom> Kambfhase: this is the console.log of the first argument (data): http://postimage.org/image/1ygr6uolg/
[10:49:24] <Rushing> but i prefer to just not have an href for links that don't go anywhere
[10:49:27] <danheberden> return false is the equivalnt of preventDefault() and stopPropagation() btw
[10:49:41] <danheberden> and preventDefault() will block anchor tags too
[10:49:59] <nvictor> Rushing, danheberden: not having the href
[10:50:01] <sandstrom> Kambfhase: I got the json in responseText and I could do JSON.parse(data.responseText) to get it out but I thought jQuery was supposed to do that for me?
[10:50:13] <nvictor> turns the <a> tag into a simple inline text
[10:50:23] <madprops> how would i acces a json dictionary item, data['key'] ?
[10:50:26] <nvictor> it does not behave like a link
[10:50:33] <danheberden> nvictor oh you have no href
[10:50:47] <nvictor> no
[10:50:52] <nvictor> i have one :)
[10:51:08] <nvictor> i was explaining why i have one
[10:51:15] <Kambfhase> madprops: dictionary? you mean object. http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter4.html
[10:51:17] <danheberden> no href seems pretty awful in any event
[10:51:21] <danheberden> accessibility wise
[10:51:46] <madprops> Kambfhase, well yeah, it's a dictionary object created in python
[10:51:48] <nvictor> preventDefault does not work
[10:51:58] <madprops> data.key then?
[10:52:35] <nvictor> danheberden: the enter key still sends the form
[10:52:53] <danheberden> nvictor and your handler is for sure being triggered?
[10:53:03] <madprops> i got it
[10:53:03] <Kambfhase> madprops: click the link i gave you.
[10:53:21] <nvictor> danheberden: $("#productform").submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[10:53:28] <nvictor> danheberden: oh let me test that
[10:53:29] <Kambfhase> sandstrom: the problem might be that you use .ajax() instead of .getJSON() just guessing tho
[10:53:54] <sadmicrowave> hey guys, I'm looking for a way to iterate through a list of <li>'s while making the parent scrollable div follow the focal point.  My example is here: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/rwfUr/ It works well with up and down arrows but if you click the button the container does not scroll to follow the element iteration.  Also, I'm looking for something other than scrollTo (I already know about this one and am looking for an alternative)
[10:54:00] <nvictor> danheberden: no, handler is not triggered
[10:54:28] <ironfroggy> is there any place that documents browser-specific problems that jquery methods work around?
[10:54:34] <sandstrom> Kambfhase: since there are converters setup (jQuery thing) I'm guessing their output should go somewhere, but I've probably misunderstood things)
[10:54:37] <danheberden> nvictor so you gots a different problem :p
[10:54:51] <danheberden> like $productform not existing when you're setting up the handler
[10:54:58] <danheberden> *#productform
[10:55:47] <danheberden> do a var $pf = $( '#productform' )... in there and then console.log( $pf );
[10:55:58] <danheberden> see what the heck you're getting
[11:06:08] <seanjm> I am trying to insert a <div> after another div, if it's the 3rd child div. Only it inserts <div></div>
[11:06:30] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, show your insert code
[11:06:32] <sphinxxx> yooohooo
[11:06:36] <seanjm> I want to insert the </div> at the end, I am currently running a loop to check the total amount of div's then inserting the end </div> at the end
[11:06:43] <seanjm> sure, on second
[11:07:15] <danieliser> i need to pass a serialized form to a php script which works fine .. but this script serves 2 purposes.. 1 show the form.. 2 if submitted needs to save the output.. how can i pass the submit variable to use in the php? should i try to manipulate the serialized string to add it or is there another way?
[11:07:17] <sphinxxx> how can i hack this so that the autoslide stops on the last slide? http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/
[11:07:50] <Raverix> Hello, I'm looking to do an 'inset border' animation.
[11:08:05] <danieliser> add a count.. when count >= number of slides stop
[11:08:28] <blacksoul> hey, after help from kborchers, i get it work, that my getJSON request is sent as source of an autocomplete, but it wont show me something and i dont know if my json is false or my getJSON callback function is declared in a wrong way http://jsfiddle.net/QyvGw/
[11:08:28] <braddunbar> Is there a server-side filtering for jQuery mobile listviews somewhere?
[11:08:31] <Raverix> I found a plugin which does mostly what I want, http://css-tricks.com/6942-inset-border-effect/, but it's got some limitations.
[11:08:39] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: http://www.pasteall.org/23311/javascript
[11:09:25] <Raverix> Is it possible to extend jquery's 'animate' function to allow 'custom' css? IE: if I was to do $(el).animate({insetBorder:5});, my plugin would take over the handling of the insetBorder animation?
[11:10:38] <danieliser> http://css-tricks.com/examples/InsetBorderEffect/
[11:11:13] <Raverix> danieliser: Thanks, but, that's the same link I just posted above.
[11:11:23] <Raverix> danieliser: It's too limited for what I want.
[11:11:54] <danieliser> Raverix: sorry didnt see that post
[11:12:38] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, so what exactly are you trying to insert ? and where?
[11:12:57] <kborchers[A]> blacksoul: try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/QyvGw/1/
[11:13:06] <danieliser> Raverix: wanting custom animations? looking at that its not css inset borders.. its an extra div on top of the img
[11:13:06] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: after the 3rd .cat-list-item, I want to insert a <div>
[11:13:18] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: then at the end of the .cat-list-items I want to insert </div>
[11:13:29] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, and its doing what?
[11:13:32] <blacksoul> kborchers: 1 moment and thanks :)
[11:13:45] <Raverix> danieliser: I get that, so my code would have to handle that.
[11:13:47] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: inserting <div></div> at the 3rd cat-list-item and </div> at the end
[11:14:05] <Raverix> danieliser: I can handle the HTML/CSS part of it... the question is the jquery integration.
[11:14:16] <Raverix> I'd love to make it work with 'animate' so that I could do multiple things at the same time.
[11:14:32] <Raverix> $(el).animate({opacity: 1, insetBorder: 5})
[11:15:09] <danieliser> Raverix: since the div is overlayed.. background:transparent and border:5px would do the same thing..
[11:15:21] <blacksoul> kborchers: i dont get a suggestion list, http://jsfiddle.net/QyvGw/2/ i added my response from getUser.php
[11:15:23] <danieliser> Raverix: same style effects without the hacks
[11:15:32] <blacksoul> kborchers: is my JSON "wrong" ?
[11:15:48] <devinrolsen> morning all
[11:15:48] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, try this -  http://www.pasteall.org/23313/javascript I consolidated and trimmed out some variables you don't need. such as n, .each() has an index variable built in. and you were doing an unecessary .each() to find var t, just use .size() to get the total count of a matched selector
[11:15:59] <Raverix> danieliser: Not same effect, because you also need to animate the height, and width, of the overlaying div.
[11:17:06] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, let me know if that works - it is untested so it may not...I've never used .after()
[11:17:07] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: what does the 'e' mean? function(i,e)
[11:18:06] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, the e is for element. it is basically the same as $(this) within the .each() loop.  you could replace $(this) with 'e' and it should do the same thing
[11:18:39] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: could you make the same function(i) without the e?
[11:18:43] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[11:19:00] <sadmicrowave> I just always put the e in it from habit
[11:19:06] <Teltariat> How can someone pull up CSS properties in JQuery?  If I have properties set in a CSS file, how can I basically query those from within Javascript or JQuery?
[11:19:07] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: I'll try it out, I'm still learning JQuery, :-)
[11:19:15] <sadmicrowave> np
[11:19:46] <kborchers> blacksoul: yes, you will only be able to return a list of results like { source: ["fname lname uid", "fname2 lname2 uid2" .... ]}
[11:20:10] <kborchers> blacksoul: then you'll have to change your select to somehow split that result and place in the correct fields
[11:20:14] <sadmicrowave> all - any help on this issue would be stupendous http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6737335/how-to-make-overflow-auto-container-follow-list-item-iteratation
[11:21:18] <blacksoul> kborchers: i dont want the "user" to see the userID etc., so i have to change the rendering as well, right? i looked at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data and tried to copy most of it
[11:21:32] <danieliser> Raverix: just animate the padding at the same time as the borders.. no width/height
[11:21:35] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: it works, in that it does the same thing my old code does. It still inserts a <div> and a</div> tag, instead of just the div
[11:22:05] <sadmicrowave> ok, lets revamp your method then
[11:22:11] <Raverix> danieliser: Hmmm, alright, that might work... one moment.
[11:22:11] <blacksoul> kborchers: is it possible to use my JSON (like in the example) and instead create an own rendering? because i want the 'same' list at firstname, lastname and username as well...  (its like with the same source)
[11:22:45] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: the issue is with after. For some reason it wants to close the tag.
[11:23:02] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, right, so lets do it a different way...let me experiment
[11:23:07] <devinrolsen> sadmicrowave, you should use the scrollTo plugin.
[11:23:15] <sadmicrowave> poop on that
[11:23:21] <devinrolsen> k well nevermind.
[11:24:08] <sadmicrowave> devinrolsen, lol, I've been using the scrollTo plugin, I just don't like it that much and feel like there should be a better way
[11:24:57] <devinrolsen> well you could always gather the offset top of the highlighted list item, then set a negative top (I think) to the parent container.
[11:26:06] <devinrolsen> like here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2905867/how-to-scroll-to-specific-item-using-jquery
[11:26:16] <devinrolsen> notice they say "Without a plugin"
[11:26:27] <Raverix> danieliser: Still doesn't work.
[11:26:38] <Raverix> danieliser: The problem is that the animation isn't smooth.
[11:26:57] <Raverix> danieliser: I need to remove 1 padding the moment I add 1 border.
[11:27:10] <sadmicrowave> devinrolsen, sweet, I'll look into this, thanks alot
[11:27:18] <Raverix> danieliser: But by default, I get some jumping using your method.
[11:27:22] <Raverix> One sec.
[11:27:38] <kborchers> blacksoul: yes, you can do your own render like in that example
[11:27:45] <imsky> $("#jquery").hello();
[11:27:45] <bot-t> (62 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky I've been sailing the pacific in search of the elusive wiggleback whale
[11:27:54] <danieliser> Raverix: hmm gimme time.. im sure there is an answer that will work
[11:28:11] <blacksoul> kborchers: yes, is it also possible to use an own function there again? because all 3 fields should get the same rendering in the end
[11:28:12] <Raverix> danieliser: Well, my answer is to get lower level control of the animation...
[11:28:25] <Raverix> danieliser: One sec, I'm setting up a jsfiddle test case.
[11:29:34] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: $('.cat-list-item:gt(3)').wrapAll('<div class="hide" />'); <--- this will do it
[11:29:41] <sphinxxx> is there really no one here who knows how to do this?   i need to hack this plugin so that the autoslide stops on the last slide: http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/
[11:29:51] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: using the selector greater than instead and wrapAll
[11:30:15] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, so the gt(3) pseudo-class will get all elements with an index greater than 3?
[11:30:30] <sadmicrowave> oh gt is greater than
[11:30:48] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: yeah, then wrap all of them inside the class
[11:30:58] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, thats where I was going with this, I was looking for a way to push the elements with an index greater than 3 to the hide container div
[11:31:19] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: thanks for the tip with function and size btw
[11:31:20] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, this is what I had so far http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/7NA62/
[11:31:24] <sadmicrowave> I like your way better though
[11:31:25] <kborchers> blacksoul: gonna have to try it out. never done this so would be guessing at this point
[11:31:27] <danieliser> Raverix: the way animate() works i believe is all manipulations in the options array are done at the same time over the time frame.. should be a 1/1 pixel movement.. do you have firebug open when doing it? causes major jumpiness in animations
[11:32:03] <Raverix> danieliser: This is not what I'm seeing... and I'm using chrome.
[11:32:05] <seanjm> sadmicrowave: thank you, thanks for your help too!
[11:32:11] <sadmicrowave> np
[11:32:12] <Raverix> With / without the console open.
[11:32:35] <Xeon06_> Regarding .data HTML5 attributes parsing, could a regex parsing ever be introduced? http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[11:32:41] <danieliser> Raverix: to get them to animate 1 after the other would use animate().animate()
[11:32:52] <Raverix> That's not what I need.
[11:32:58] <Raverix> I need them to animate in perfect sync.
[11:33:29] <danieliser> Raverix: right.. so in theory it is coded right.. lemme know when you get the example up
[11:34:47] <winux> Trying to get the dialog text to change color, what do i need to add? : http://jsfiddle.net/vLUxB/
[11:36:38] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/yuUKE/2/
[11:36:48] <blacksoul> kborchers: so well, once again i only copied and changed item.NAME to "my" code.. http://jsfiddle.net/QyvGw/3/ but i dont get a list ... is there a way i could debug this?
[11:36:55] <vinmassaro> When selecting IDs using this multiselect script (http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/04/jquery-multiselect/) if an ID i have assigned to load doesn't exist on the page, i 'get function does not exist': http://jsfiddle.net/3wjR5/1/
[11:37:02] <Raverix> danieliser: Trying to get a test case working with this...
[11:37:28] <sadmicrowave> devinrolsen, any idea why the iteration isn't matching up with the scrollTop? http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/rwfUr/12/
[11:37:29] <kborchers> blacksoul: if you use firebug or something like that you can see what is being passed back and forth between your app and the server
[11:38:06] <blacksoul> kborchers: yes, i see that getJSON is correct and the response as well, but i dont know, if he calls "response" because i dont get a list
[11:39:21] <kborchers> blacksoul: probably because your json is wrong. using response only works if you do it the way i said above with a single source element and an array of values. you'll have to write your own render if you want the json formatted differently
[11:40:05] <Raverix> For some reason, jsfiddle is making the padding animation weird...
[11:40:16] <blacksoul> yes, but i added my own render ( http://jsfiddle.net/QyvGw/3/ like in the example from http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data), kborchers
[11:42:49] <Finity> Hey guys, I'm trying to decide between two jQuery Books:  JQuery in Action, 2nd Edition OR jQuery Novice to Ninja.  I'm not looking for a "beginners" book, since I'm a longtime programmer, and just want to pick up the syntax and common idioms as quickly as possible
[11:43:37] <ColKurtz> Finity, are you familiar with javascript/html/css?
[11:43:59] <djQuery> ?jqf
[11:44:00] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:44:31] <djQuery> Finity: if all you want are the basics of jquery that should do it.
[11:44:56] <djQuery> skip the first chapter if you allready know javascript
[11:46:34] <Finity> ColKurtz: yes, lot of html/css, and actually a little bit of jQuery already
[11:46:49] <Finity> looking for something in print form, preferably
[11:49:07] <ColKurtz> well Finity, I bought myself a nice shiny jQuery book
[11:49:16] <ColKurtz> that i've never really used. lol
[11:49:22] <ColKurtz> it's pretty damn easy to just jump right in
[11:49:26] <Xeon06_> Wow, .data takes the attribute data-foo-bar and converts it to fooBar, how awesome is that?
[11:49:53] <vinmassaro> how to prevent 'is not a function errors'? I'm attaching a function to multiple IDs, not all are present on each page. Do I need to check if the ID exists first?
[11:50:18] <djQuery> ColKurtz: dont know how many manual\books I have that I have given up on after the 1st 3 chapters because they didnt cover anything I hadnt allready learned from playing around with the product\etc
[11:50:32] <Finity> ColKurtz: yeah, I watched a youtube video by a 13 year old at the google conference, that summed up 99% of it.  I'm just wanting something I could read on as if I was going to be tested on the material
[11:50:58] <djQuery> Finity: seen that vid
[11:51:20] <blacksoul> kborchers: got it working, problem were the missing [ ] around the json encode "string"
[11:51:27] <ColKurtz> what do you need to use jQuery for Finity ?
[11:51:40] <ColKurtz> anything in particular?
[11:51:47] <sphinxxx> djQuery  yes, can you save the day for me?
[11:52:54] <djQuery> sphinxxx: I hearby give you the day off. YEAH the day is saved
[11:53:17] <sphinxxx> i havent gotten a response all day on this
[11:53:33] <sphinxxx> http://www.nautiandco.com/   i need to have the slideshow autoslide to the last slide, and then stop
[11:53:35] <Finity> ColKurtz: well, MCPD certification.  I'll be studying some ASP.NET material soon, and the test requires some knowledge of jQuery for validation.  I'm certain the books I'll be getting for ASP.NET will cover the majority of it, but hey, I'm not buying the books, sooooo :)
[11:53:47] <sphinxxx> currently it just loops, and the plugin seems to have no option of doing this functionality
[11:54:24] <djQuery> Finity: I have been studying for that as well and some of the example the practice tests are kinda weird
[11:54:28] <Finity> When I say "Some" ASP.NET, I really mean "A lot of" ASP.NET
[11:55:08] <Finity> not sure if this is linkable, but: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DHY2W555XXYY
[11:55:14] <Finity> that's my current book wishlist
[11:55:31] <Finity> I'm new to C# and .NET as a whole, so I'm imagining the majority of my time will go to that
[11:56:01] <johnernaut> I haven't messed around with .NET in a long time 0.o
[11:56:07] <Finity> all the rest of my development has either been C++ study, or Python and Django webdev (with some PHP thrown in there before I realized how bad of a language it was :D)
[11:56:16] * djQuery wonders how long till John Resigns book comes out
[11:57:17] * djQuery http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1311015414&sr=8-1
[11:57:36] <ColKurtz> http://www.amazon.com/Learning-jQuery-Interaction-Development-JavaScript/dp/1847192505 is the book i have. any thoughts on that one?
[11:57:41] <sphinxxx> djQuery:  so there is no hope?
[11:58:41] <djQuery> ?slideviewpro
[11:58:42] <bot-t> djQuery, jQuery slideViewerPro 1.0 - http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/index.html
[11:58:55] <salazr> hey.. need some jquery ui help.. working with selectable() and would like to enable multiple item selection by defalt, rather than by holding down a key to trigger it.. can't figure it out reading the docs.. any idea?
[11:59:30] <djQuery> sphinxxx: does it not have a slidefinished callback?
[11:59:52] <sphinxxx> unfortunately not that i can see :http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/svwt/
[12:00:47] <djQuery> sphinxxx: there are so many plugins that dont give a callback.
[12:00:50] <Soothsayer> is there an event I can tap into to know when an element is removed from the DOM ?
[12:01:05] <blacksoul> is it possible to write this shorter? http://pastebin.com/Q1353wSZ (same thing with 3 IDs)
[12:01:22] <sphinxxx> i was hoping you'd now how to hack it to just get it to stop at the last slide
[12:02:49] <sphinxxx> djQuery:  sry got disconnected, did you say anything
[12:03:32] <djQuery> sphinxxx: wtf???? why is it changing the id of the container? container.attr("id", "svwp"+j);
[12:03:36] <Finity> djQuery: going for 2008/.NET 3.5 , or 2010/.NET 4?
[12:04:02] <gnarf> Soothsayer: no
[12:04:03] <Rushing> anyone know what causes some links to be "bordered" in webkit?
[12:04:09] <sphinxxx> djQuery:  idk its not my plugin:\
[12:04:13] <djQuery> Finity: might as well do the newest 1
[12:04:14] <Rushing> only seems to show up in jquery ui dialogs right now
[12:04:36] <gnarf> Rushing: inspect it?
[12:04:40] <Rushing> looks like some kind of browser functionality to highlight a link
[12:04:50] <gnarf> might just be the outline property
[12:04:54] <Finity> djQuery: that's how I feel, sadly, the self training kits aren't even all out yet, not to mention, what I've heard to be the best book for WCF book doesn't come out until December
[12:04:57] <Finity> so I'm just settling :)
[12:06:52] <Rushing> i think that's it gnarf...weird that i only see it in the dialogs. i thought my reset.css had outline:0 but apparently not on anchors
[12:07:10] <gnarf> might want to push that to the a:meta ones too
[12:07:17] <gnarf> like a:active
[12:07:25] <gnarf> i forget where outline: is set...
[12:07:32] <djQuery> sphinxxx: dont know I read the code and the way that they implimented it there doesnt seem to be a way to do it.
[12:08:08] <sphinxxx> what a shame, the plugin works so nicely.. client is going to be upset
[12:08:42] <b1lly> lets say im using jquery UI for draggable sortable
[12:09:31] <b1lly> and I wanted to put an "<input>" button within the draggable <li> </li>....i want to make it so that if you click the button it resets the draggable <li> element back to its original pos
[12:09:53] <ColKurtz> Would you guys say this snippet is the best way to fire $('img').load() whether the image is cached or not? http://api.jquery.com/load-event#comment-32538197
[12:10:51] <sadmicrowave> b1lly, is there a question in there somewhere?
[12:11:38] <Rushing> ColKurtz, stanvp's suggestion doesn't really make sense...it forces the load event in ie6 whether the image is loaded or not
[12:11:49] <ColKurtz> that's what i thought
[12:11:54] <ColKurtz> iv'e always done
[12:12:14] <ColKurtz> if $('#theImg')[0].complete
[12:12:33] <ColKurtz> else load()
[12:12:36] <b1lly> sadmicrowave: lol, is it possible to make the input button reset the dragable element back to its original posisiotn
[12:12:39] <b1lly> position*
[12:13:42] <blacksoul> is it possible to write this shorter? http://pastebin.com/Q1353wSZ (same thing with 3 IDs)
[12:13:47] <djQuery> sphinxxx: http://css-tricks.com/examples/AnythingSlider/
[12:13:59] <Rushing> chris's method is a good one. not sure why it wouldn't work in ie6, but i remember having to do a dance on this init image loading a coupl eyears ago
[12:14:02] <djQuery> this one has a onSlideBegin
[12:14:37] <Rushing> why not use cycle? that's a great plugin
[12:15:07] <Rushing> little less out of hte box with the thumbnails, but pretty easily doable
[12:15:52] <djQuery> Rushing: sphinxx is looking for one that he can stop when reaching the last image while it is autoplay mode
[12:16:18] <djQuery> instead of it cycling back to the first
[12:16:19] <sadmicrowave> b1lly, the only thing I see in the draggable documentation is revert, but that will force it to revert when the dragging stops, maybe you could copy the source of the revert option to your own function and call it on input click
[12:16:24] <ColKurtz> Rushing, thankfully i no longer have to care about IE6 :D
[12:17:03] <Rushing> yeah, cycle has the autostop parameter
[12:17:26] <djQuery> sphinxxx: ^^^^^^^^^^
[12:17:40] <sphinxxx> the one i have on there now is really well designed, not the code but i mean how it looks
[12:17:49] <Rushing> i think the "nowrap" option is for looping too...you'd have to test though - wierd thing to call it
[12:17:53] <sphinxxx> i think i might have a way to hack it
[12:18:16] <Rushing> cycle is bestest ;)
[12:19:19] <Rushing> plus, the styles should all be up to you...you could probably copy most of the styles that slideViewerPro thing has and just use cycle with it
[12:19:25] <ryrych> hi buddies :D
[12:19:53] <Xeon06_> Can $.when take an array of deferred objects?
[12:20:35] <ryrych> could you tell me how many Opera versions do you support making your own jQuery UI widgets?
[12:20:55] <ryrych> I haven't a clue how many support
[12:21:35] <ghufran> Hi. i'm doing something like: http://pastie.org/2233252 . though its working, i was wondering if there's a way to stop repeating everything..
[12:21:57] <ryrych> Opera has got smart users and they don't use old versions
[12:22:39] <b1lly> sadmicrowave: thx, not the solution i was looking for lol

[12:27:58] <danieliser> Raverix: still on?
[12:29:59] <Raverix> Yup
[12:30:02] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/1/
[12:31:05] <danieliser> tested in chrome, ie9 + 8, and ff 4
[12:32:30] <daniel3> love the nickname
[12:33:33] <danieliser> Raverix: try revision 2.. keeps a 1px border instead: http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/2/
[12:34:11] <djQuery> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Sv7nw/3/    hate the way that animate allways quest it up
[12:35:14] <danieliser> lol.. ty.. was just trying to help Raverix fake inset-border
[12:36:06] <Raverix> danieliser: Your example exhibits the same problem I was talking about.
[12:36:10] <Raverix> Take a look on the right hand side...
[12:36:16] <Raverix> As it animates, you can see a sliver of black.
[12:36:39] <djQuery> Raverix: yeah I can see it in chrome as well
[12:36:55] <djQuery> on the right and bottom
[12:36:58] <Raverix> Exactly.
[12:37:14] <Raverix> It's either because the browser is apply the CSS a split second apart...
[12:38:01] <danieliser> other option is instead of padding use top: left: positioning to and grow the width, or use overflow:hidden on the parent and increase the padding till the border is hidden.. one sec..
[12:38:36] <Raverix> I think the answer is being able to adjust the padding:border at the same moment.
[12:41:28] <Raverix> Maybe the answer is TWO inset divs?
[12:41:38] <Raverix> One which is positioned absolutely on the bottom right, the other top left.
[12:41:41] <Raverix> And then animate them in.
[12:41:55] <Raverix> One sec... gonna test that.
[12:42:43] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/5/
[12:43:06] <danieliser> give that a shot raverix.. no lines
[12:43:20] <Raverix> That looks sexy to me..
[12:43:20] <Klacsap_> hello. i wrote my problem under the code. http://pastebin.com/qkJ7AczP . and maybee ... how can i make it infinite deep?
[12:43:58] <danieliser> could be cleaned up to use +20px instead of hardcoding sizes.
[12:44:34] <kasunLak> I am getting a error status saying 'parseerror' though it's a success response?
[12:44:38] <kasunLak> any ideas?
[12:44:39] <g0bl1n> on a received JSONP data object, say with 30 positions, I'd like to delete the last 20. How can one do that ?
[12:44:54] <danieliser> lol.. try it with different border types.. get a nice effect if you change the border type to dotted.. or double'
[12:45:09] <b1lly> lets say I had a variable (var doggie)            and than i wanted to create a new variable, with the value of (doggie) _index -- is this possible?
[12:45:25] <danieliser> Raverix: that solution work for your needs?
[12:45:25] <b1lly> so like... val(doggie)_1 = "new variable";
[12:45:42] <Raverix> danieliser: I think so... testing it out...
[12:46:23] <Raverix> danieliser: So the concept is you're hiding the border by animating it out...
[12:46:31] <Raverix> danieliser: and putting overflow hidden.
[12:47:38] <danieliser> Raverix: dashed works well too.. yea.. the containing element gets the size of the img and overflow of hidden.. then overlay the transparent border div usingin absolute.. and animate the position and width.. border never changes
[12:47:39] <g0bl1n> b1lly, val(doggie+'_1') = 'new val'  ?
[12:49:08] <b1lly> so val(bin_id+'_result') = "new val"; ?
[12:49:14] <Raverix> danieliser: Unfortunately, in my case... I need to also animate a small arrow as well, so overflow hidden is not going to work... but, I'll modify it to have an extra wrapper to put the overflow hidden on, and we should be good.
[12:49:18] <Raverix> danieliser: Thank you.
[12:50:05] <danieliser> Raverix: could always put the arrow in an absolute positioned div z-indexed above the inset..
[12:50:18] <Raverix> danieliser: Perhaps.
[12:50:28] <danieliser> css = magick
[12:50:37] <danieliser> but spelled correctly
[12:50:47] <b1lly> g0bl1n: not working
[12:50:59] <g0bl1n> b1lly, I'm building a pastie for you
[12:54:03] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/6/
[12:54:13] <g0bl1n> b1lly, is it this you want ?
[12:54:15] <g0bl1n> http://www.pastie.org/2233395
[12:55:36] <danieliser> Raverix: you could even inject the container and overlay div using jquery so if they dont have js they get the whole image
[12:56:02] <Raverix> danieliser: Precisely what I had for my previous technique.
[12:56:13] <b1lly> g0bl1n: no
[12:56:31] <Raverix> I have a js/nojs class on my body tag so that I can apply styles accordingly.
[12:56:42] <danieliser> Raverix: looks good in multiples http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/6/

[12:57:28] <muay-guy> sorry, n00b question here... how do I select something like this ".stock-table tbody tr:last-child td" in jQuery?
[12:57:40] <Raverix> danieliser: Backwards, but sexy./

[12:58:44] <b1lly> g0bl1n: see what i'm trying to do?
[12:59:49] <g0bl1n> b1lly, testing...
[13:00:00] <danieliser> Raverix: yea.. already saved the effect in my scripts
[13:00:03] <Zzaichik> muay-guy: What do you mean, 'select'?  Are you looking for something like $('.classname') ?
[13:00:07] <Raverix> danieliser: :)
[13:00:45] <muay-guy> Zzaichik: I want to apply some styles to .stock-table tbody tr:last-child td  and I know IE is not gonna help me much
[13:02:16] <danieliser> muay-guy.. so use .length() to get the number of tr and use .eq() on the result
[13:03:18] <g0bl1n> b1lly,
[13:03:22] <g0bl1n> b1lly, use eval()
[13:03:54] <g0bl1n> b1lly, eval('bin_'+index+'_result);
[13:04:18] <g0bl1n> b1lly, to get the value of var bin_1_result
[13:05:10] <g0bl1n> b1lly, eval('bin_'+2+'_result) will evaluate bin_2_result that being a variable. Watch out using evals :)
[13:05:47] <ngharo> eww
[13:05:53] <ngharo> no
[13:05:56] <ngharo> var bin = {}
[13:05:58] <sphinxxx> is there any way to "listen" (as an event) for a change in an attribute, such as opacity
[13:06:02] <b1lly> g0bl1n:  thanx
[13:06:04] <ngharo> bin[index] = 'blah';
[13:06:10] <b1lly> watch out using evals?
[13:06:32] <danieliser> raverix: http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/8/.. you have to hover them all first, id didnt feel like fixing the css.. but not bad
[13:06:36] <g0bl1n> b1lly,  the strings will be evaluated as code. Beware for user inputs :-)
[13:06:38] <ngharo> b1lly: g0bl1n you can get the same functionality using an object
[13:07:07] <Raverix> danieliser: Interesting :)
[13:07:25] <g0bl1n> ngharo, b1lly wanted to to this http://www.pastie.org/2233403
[13:07:28] <danieliser> not quite as sexy..
[13:08:25] <g0bl1n> ngharo, on a received JSONP data object, say with 30 positions, I'd like to delete the last 20. How can one do that ?
[13:08:28] <davock> What could be happen if i get a corrupted html on IE when i do  .ajax ?
[13:09:33] <g0bl1n> b1lly, was referring to code injection using eval(). If you control the code, that's ok. Quite used in metaprogramming
[13:09:40] <davock> I use .ajax function for getting some html code on response, but these html content in the response is corrupted ( some tags are missed and html tags are uppercased)
[13:10:30] <davock> is there any reason for that html corrupted?
[13:10:58] <seanjm> trying to check if a varible exists if (var === 'undefined') doesn't work, if (var === ' ') also doesn't work
[13:11:10] <danieliser> Raverix: try this one with opacity http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/Sv7nw/6/
[13:11:21] <ngharo> g0bl1n: from an array?
[13:11:43] <g0bl1n> ngharo, JSONP returns an Object that is an array in effect

[13:14:52] <jzaksh> hello, i'd like to call hide on a jquery object.. but i  might also want to call show. i'm deciding dynamically. is there a way to say, var action = 'hide'; var action = 'show'; and then do action($('seleection'))?
[13:14:58] <sadmicrowave> seanjm, whether they will actually be helpful or not is another story

[13:16:08] <g0bl1n> ngharo, ty !!!
[13:16:20] <nvictor> hey
[13:16:34] <danieliser> Raverix.. add the jquery color animations plugin and you could change the colors while your at it
[13:16:43] <nvictor> what is the proper way to prepend a newly created DOM element to another element
[13:17:18] <nvictor> i tried $('#myid').prepend($('</strong>', {'html':'my content'})); and it didn't work
[13:17:27] <danieliser> $(<div id="newdiv"></div>).prependTo('element')
[13:18:07] <sadmicrowave> jzaksh, just use the if statement that you would use to set var action and set $('select').hide() else $('selector').show()
[13:18:15] <zulax> while doing ajax call, is it possible to call just a function in the php file?
[13:19:15] <sadmicrowave> jzaksh, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/2ZWSG/
[13:20:34] <nvictor> danieliser: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'createDocumentFragment'
[13:22:37] <nvictor> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/rf6eq/
[13:23:06] <tmayr> i wonder, are numbers acceptable as input names?
[13:23:27] <sadmicrowave> tmayr, yes
[13:23:44] <tmayr> so <input name="0"/> would be perfectly valid?
[13:23:54] <sadmicrowave> I don't see why not
[13:24:10] <tmayr> i heard somewhere that numbers as id were not valid
[13:24:25] <nvictor> danieliser: nvm, seems it doesn't work with jquery elements
[13:24:38] <Krambfhase> ?valid id @ tmayr
[13:24:38] <bot-t> tmayr, ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[13:24:59] <davock> Is there any replacement for jquery form plugin ?   It's bugged on IE
[13:25:06] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, but the attr('name') is different form an id
[13:25:20] <tmayr> ah, so it wouldnt be valid, sucks :p
[13:25:28] <Krambfhase> that also applies to names. see the link
[13:25:34] <tmayr> yeah, it applies to both
[13:25:37] <tmayr> thanks Krambfhase :P
[13:25:40] <Krambfhase> np
[13:26:23] <sadmicrowave> tmayr, Krambfhase, sorry about speaking to something I apparently did not know
[13:27:04] <tmayr> well, i do that quite frequently sadmicrowave, no need to apologize :P
[13:27:13] <sadmicrowave> **embarrassed**
[13:27:22] <tmayr> hah
[13:27:46] <Krambfhase> your sins are forgiven, my son!
[13:27:55] <sadmicrowave> thank you father
[13:29:05] <genR> Hi, is there a known incompability between jquery 1.3, firefox 3.6, and making use of object prototypes ? Does the error message "H.apply is not a function" rings any bells ?
[13:29:13] <genR> http://jsfiddle.net/6sWcB/6/
[13:29:19] <genR> If I open my js console I see js errors after each click on the hooked elements. Comment out the line changing the prototype : no more problems !
[13:29:29] <djQuery> 1.3?????????????
[13:29:35] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:29:41] <djQuery> genR: dont like up gradeing much?
[13:29:50] <sadmicrowave> bahaha
[13:29:52] <genR> I don't get to choose the framework
[13:31:18] <Krambfhase> genR: you code sucks. thats why.
[13:31:25] <Krambfhase> like WTF are you doing?
[13:32:02] <sadmicrowave> are you changing the constructor.prototype of an empty object?
[13:32:15] <djQuery> genR: its not jquery thats the issue. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6sWcB/7/
[13:32:40] <Krambfhase> by doing x.constructor.prototype you actually reference Object.prototype which you should NEVAR touch!
[13:32:42] <sadmicrowave> I can't get the error to replicate for me in my error console
[13:34:30] <genR> well, it seems I simplified the thing a bit too much
[13:34:48] <genR> didn't know Object.prototype was off limits
[13:35:25] <Krambfhase> it is, atleast in ES3
[13:35:52] <systemfault> How is it off limit?
[13:36:02] <sadmicrowave> rather, why is it off limits?
[13:36:03] <systemfault> It's bad practice, that's about it AFAIK.
[13:36:42] <Gho5t> $('#foo').addClass('a'); $('#foo2').addClass('a'); <-- Is there a way to do this in one statement?
[13:36:46] <Krambfhase> it breaks code.
[13:37:15] <systemfault> Gho5t: Sure, a better selector :P
[13:37:19] <plug918> hello, how can i setting a select list option value, i meaning change the entire selection list value
[13:37:30] <systemfault> $('#foo, #foo2').addClass('a');
[13:37:42] <sadmicrowave> Gho5t, $("#foo").addClass('a').parent().find('#foo2').addClass('a')
[13:37:42] <Gho5t> danke
[13:37:45] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:37:53] <Krambfhase> bitte
[13:37:56] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: What?
[13:37:58] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:38:04] <sadmicrowave> :P
[13:38:44] <systemfault> :)
[13:38:46] <djQuery> how would you pass in a variable to a ui.widget and have it being byref instead of by var. ie   $('#myid').({option: thesearebyval}, x)  so that changes made to x inside the widget are reflected in x outside the widger
[13:39:00] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, that's the long way, and it works provided they are in the same place in the DOM hierarchy
[13:39:23] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: I don't like the "provided....."
[13:39:29] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:39:47] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: They're IDs, there only one of each on the page :P
[13:40:07] <systemfault> And nothing's faster than selectioning by ID :P
[13:40:24] <Krambfhase> selecting nothing is faster!
[13:40:34] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, absolutely correct
[13:40:36] <djQuery> Krambfhase: ++
[13:40:46] <sadmicrowave> haha

[13:43:35] <sadmicrowave> oh god
[13:43:57] <elriser> Anyone knows if its possible to add click and drag functionality to webpage with jquery, (for iphone)
[13:44:11] <genR> so, looking it up half the objects where I was touching the prototype didn't have a creator function and were just plain object literals...
[13:44:15] <genR> Thanks, all
[13:44:24] <sadmicrowave> elriser, #jquerymobile
[13:44:58] <Krambfhase> genR: If you dont know JS properly, maybe use an inheritance library.
[13:45:12] <genR> Aaaw, that hurt
[13:45:38] <Krambfhase> Its a fact, that most people dont understand how to do classes in JS
[13:45:55] <elriser> sadmicrowave: thanks
[13:45:56] <Krambfhase> Its tricky
[13:46:44] <genR> was kidding
[13:47:03] <genR> it had been some time since the last time I dove in
[13:47:45] <jbrokc> how do I determine whether or not a given element contains a class with jquery?
[13:47:57] <jbrokc> preferably something that returns a boolean
[13:47:59] <systemfault> jbrokc: .is IIRC
[13:48:10] <sadmicrowave> isn't there a .hasClass() ?
[13:48:28] <sadmicrowave> I thought I saw that somewhere, let me look
[13:48:36] <systemfault> hhright

[13:49:57] <madprops> any idea why a text string inside a json response comes with added commas?
[13:50:02] <madprops> ","
[13:50:08] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: eclipse is "acceptable".
[13:50:25] <systemfault> (Or Aptana) which is more of less eclipse.
[13:50:43] <systemfault> If you want to pay, PHPStorm is a better tool
[13:51:05] <sadmicrowave> ++free
[13:51:09] <djQuery> so did I not phrase the question understably?
[13:51:19] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Free is often a very bad argument.
[13:51:31] <elriser> ok, sow how should I use this jquery mobile thing? Are there any examples for it?
[13:51:37] <systemfault> I don't mind paying for a tool that I like and will make me more productive.
[13:51:47] <ngharo> vim + ctags :)
[13:51:56] <systemfault> ngharo: I love vim
[13:52:04] <djQuery> elriser: the whole jquery mobile site is an example
[13:52:07] <systemfault> I never found ctags to do a good job though :(
[13:52:14] <systemfault> Except... for C
[13:52:48] <ngharo> I dont use it excessively but it works great for finding classes/functions
[13:52:51] <ngharo> which is all i use it for
[13:53:01] <systemfault> ngharo: Right :)
[13:53:11] <ngharo> i use cscope also for what ctags misses
[13:54:05] <sadmicrowave> I'm using geany right now, but thats just more of an editor than an IDE
[13:54:26] <elriser> djQuery: hmm, I see. I'm a bit confused. I should just download it and it will work out of the box (after adding it to my header) ? I guess not
[13:55:18] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: komodo edit isn't bad either.
[13:55:21] <elriser> I just need to target an element so it is draggable
[13:55:29] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: I've tried them all I think :P

[13:55:46] <nvictor> i want to use the jquery template
[13:55:55] <nvictor> but it's been in beta for two years
[13:55:56] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, eclipse looks like you have to have a separate one for php and js
[13:55:56] <ngharo> systemfault: sounds like you need to commit and learn one
[13:55:59] <nvictor> anything better?
[13:56:15] <mohi666> I have a query that returns 156 big elements in 30 seconds. I want to display all the elements at once to users. Is there any article using jQuery that I can use to make this happen using Ajax, without users noticing about anything?
[13:56:16] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: No, you only need to add plugins
[13:56:37] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Take a look at aptana, it's a already customized "eclipse"

[14:07:29] <snowinferno|2> Hi all. I think I've found a bug in the draggable code using JQuery 1.6.2 and JQuery-UI 1.8.14. In firefox, if the browser window is scrolled away from the edges and you attempt to drag a draggable object, the draggable object jumps to the page edges before it starts moving
[14:07:38] <ngharo> Marduk2: it's treating it as it should ... as a string
[14:07:48] <systemfault> PHP rots the mind.
[14:08:00] <systemfault> What's the idea with that stupid array-like notation?
[14:08:33] <ngharo> array _all_ the things!
[14:08:35] <Krambfhase> snowinferno|2: feel free to create a demo @ jsfiddle.net
[14:08:36] <kborchers> snowinferno|2: jQuery UI does not support 1.6.x yet. you'll need to use 1.5.2 until it is supported
[14:08:45] <Marduk2> ngharo, thanks
[14:13:47] <grid_> hey
[14:14:46] <ngharo> hay
[14:17:00] <grid_> i use google chrome and i have a page that will use a jquery ui dialog, my problem is that i embed windows media player streams, through the popup you can see the player http://jsfiddle.net/JssRq/ i have to cover my iframe temporary, but how could i do that?
[14:17:36] <logansrun> why is this not alerting? http://pastebin.com/Rpp5UqWc
[14:17:41] <snowinferno|2> Krambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/CBCaJ/ The only reason I'm using a wrapper div is because I'm using resizable on the image, which has it's own issue in Chrome
[14:18:50] <ngharo> grid_: try setting iframe display: none when dialog is active
[14:19:29] <ngharo> or set the src to something other than your wmp plugin page
[14:19:33] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, I'm liking aptana :)
[14:19:42] <systemfault> Good :)
[14:20:25] <grid_> ngharo: does it require to reload the page?
[14:20:33] <grid_> atleast my iframe
[14:21:15] <ngharo> setting iframe src will reload it, setting display: none will not
[14:22:00] <snowinferno|2> kborchers: I just updated my code to reference JQuery 1.5.2 and it behaves similarly but less dramatically
[14:22:03] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, are you on a linux box?
[14:22:31] <grid_> ngharo: do you have any clue about a little code change? you could give a change at my jsfiddle post maybe
[14:23:14] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Yes and no :/ I'm currently on OSX ssh'ed into my small linux server using irssi in a screen.
[14:23:20] <snowinferno|2> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/z9u8h/ is a jsfiddle displaying the issue using 1.5.2
[14:23:23] <systemfault> Does that counts? :/
[14:23:47] <sadmicrowave> eh...ye
[14:23:48] <sadmicrowave> s
[14:26:47] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, I ask because I can't figure out how to install the application. I'm running it via the executable now but havn't installed it.  There is nothing in the downloaded package about installation
[14:26:58] <systemfault> Hmm
[14:27:00] <systemfault> 2 seconds
[14:27:56] <systemfault> Downloading it :P
[14:28:09] <systemfault> Tooks less than a minute here.. so perhaps it's your connection
[14:28:17] <sadmicrowave> shh
[14:28:22] <logansrun> systemfault can you pm me on this?
[14:28:27] <ngharo> grid_: http://jsfiddle.net/JssRq/2/
[14:28:33] <systemfault> logansrun: On what?
[14:28:46] <ngharo> grid_: take note how I seperated out your style, js, and html in jsfiddle
[14:29:00] <ngharo> grid_: this is how you should fiddle in the future
[14:29:03] <kborchers> snowinferno|2: this is a known bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7278 I submitted a fix for it here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/346 but it was not accepted because it involved changing the position to absolute. that may work as a workaround for you see http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/z9u8h/1/
[14:29:35] <ngharo> grid_: but my changes are in the open and close dialog events.  see how that works for you
[14:30:17] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Hmm, there's nothing special to do...
[14:30:29] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, just double click the executable?
[14:30:39] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: unzip the thing somewhere, open the directory and doucle-click the executable.
[14:30:58] <eniac> Can you use .data on elements that are generated using $.template ?
[14:31:12] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, right, but thats just running for the executable session, once you close aptana you will have to open it back up using the executable again...
[14:31:19] <ngharo> sadmicrowave: on linux I like to create ~/bin then add that to PATH (export PATH=$PATH:~/bin)
[14:31:23] <sadmicrowave> from the executable session*
[14:31:37] <ShawnRisk> how come this code is not doing anything:  <script> jQuery(function () { if(jQuery('.js-news').length > 0) { jQuery('.js-news').ticker({speed: 0.10, titleText: 'Upcoming', controls: false, displayType: 'fade', fadeInSpeed: 300, fadeOutSpeed: 300}); } }); </script> on ecosanity.org under the slideshow and under the calendar where the ordered list is?
[14:31:56] <ngharo> then you can dump arbitrary execs in ~/bin without cluttering /usr/bin
[14:32:51] <skiz> I'm having some problems trying to test the jquery templates... https://gist.github.com/c706d6503b3aade078fd
[14:34:03] <kborchers> snowinferno|2: hope that helps. gotta go
[14:34:17] <grid_> ngharo: i'm suprised how good it works with chrome, i only notice that the sound will stop playing with firefox
[14:34:37] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: there is an error logged in console
[14:34:53] <grid_> atleast when you open the popup
[14:35:47] <grid_> it works also perfect with internet explorer
[14:36:16] <snowinferno|2> Darn, I didn't get an opportunity to thank kborchers
[14:36:48] <grid_> ngharo: thanks for this tweak, do you think you can fix the firefox trouble?
[14:37:39] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: how to fix this?
[14:39:54] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: i think the problem is lack of an ID on your UL element
[14:40:54] <innociv> ban nadia_
[14:41:09] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: line 22 of jquery.ticker.js evals to just '#' which is your prob
[14:41:16] <ngharo> var newsID = '#' + $(this).attr('id'); <- line 22
[14:41:36] <innociv> It's a spam bot
[14:42:08] <grid_> ngharo :)
[14:42:42] <ngharo> grid_: i dunno.  plugins usually always steal z-focus
[14:42:50] <ngharo> you could maybe move it offscreen
[14:42:53] <ngharo> or something like that
[14:43:20] <ngharo> or just position your dialog not to fall on top of your plugin
[14:43:57] <grid_> i just tried today the jquery ui dialog, they work very well, the problem did begin with another popup, so i switched to jquery ui dialog, so same problem :) i'm not a really good coder like you are
[14:43:59] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: sorry OL element, not UL ;)
[14:44:20] <rethus1> whats wrong here... why does the sting are not convert to json?
[14:44:24] <rethus1> http://jsfiddle.net/9Xe6X/
[14:44:27] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: I changed to . and class and now it is a UL instead of OL
[14:44:39] <ShawnRisk> still not rotating
[14:45:26] <systemfault> rethus1: What do you expect the output to be?
[14:45:37] <systemfault> Do you understand that JSON is a string?
[14:46:11] <grid_> ngharo: "or just position your dialog not to fall on top of your plugin" how do you mean this exactly?
[14:46:20] <rethus1> json like {command:{context:'konference list 1'}}
[14:46:33] <systemfault> rethus1: You need to do it yourself.
[14:47:00] <systemfault> rethus1: http://jsfiddle.net/9Xe6X/1/
[14:47:25] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: why didnt you simply add an ID to the element instead of modifying the plugin?  ID lookups will be much faster (exactly why the plugin uses it)
[14:47:38] <rethus1> if i do it on my own, i didn't need stringify - right?
[14:47:57] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: let me try
[14:47:58] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, got it all, I just created my own launcher to point to the executable in /usr/bin
[14:48:09] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: :)
[14:48:19] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, thanks for the info and help
[14:48:25] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: You're welcome
[14:48:42] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, I'm liking the integrated command console :)
[14:49:08] <systemfault> Yeah, it's a good IDE overall
[14:49:18] <ngharo> grid_: as in set either your dialog or iframe left and top attributes to something so they dont collide
[14:49:26] <sadmicrowave> and I can organize my files into projects :)
[14:49:32] <sadmicrowave> anyways, ttyl
[14:49:40] <systemfault> :)
[14:52:46] <grid_> ngharo: aah i think i understand it a littlebit, not as much to code it myself i believe, it would be the only thing left to setup my site, can you help me this time again?
[14:57:41] <ngharo> grid_: jeepers.  http://jsfiddle.net/JssRq/4/
[14:58:55] <grid_> ngharo: it will stop playing the music again with firefox, hmm
[15:01:27] <grid_> ngharo: this site will use something like we discuss too: http://www.nederland.fm/ but they use a dojo framework
[15:01:44] <grid_> i dont know how they do it exactly
[15:04:42] * ngharo shrugs
[15:05:10] <ngharo> i can repro since im chrome on linux
[15:06:44] <grid_> ngharo: it is atleast possible to make it work i believe :)
[15:08:19] <systemfault> ?eval $.each({foo: 'bar', baz: 'lol'}, function(key, val) { console.log( key + " = " + val);});
[15:08:21] <bot-t> systemfault: "foo = bar""baz = lol"{"foo": "bar", "baz": "lol"}
[15:09:30] <grid_> ngharo: do you think you have any option left to avoid the firefox trouble?
[15:11:26] <grid_> ngharo: i probably have a solution, when you resize the popup with firefox, the music will play again
[15:11:44] <grid_> if you dont touch it, it will keep interupt
[15:16:22] <grid_> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/JssRq/4/ sorry it works here ok, but it will interupt the stream like 1 sec when you open/close the popup (only with firefox), can you change this?
[15:21:22] <ngharo> grid_: i cant see the plugin so it's a little difficult to fix it ;)
[15:21:59] <grid__> ngharo: true, are you always on linux?
[15:22:07] <ngharo> grid__: yes
[15:25:49] <GeO`> hey guys
[15:26:03] <GeO`> I'm fighting with a div I turned into a button()
[15:26:35] <GeO`> I need it to maintain the ui-state-active onmouseout, but I tried a lot of things I can't do it...
[15:27:23] <ngharo> ?p
[15:27:24] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:27:38] <GeO`> a classic $('#id').mouseout(function() { $(this).addClass('ui-state-active') ; });   doesn't work
[15:28:02] <GeO`> the only relevant piece of code is that
[15:28:19] <GeO`> the rest is a simple div I turned with $('#id').button();
[15:28:19] <ngharo> please fiddle so i can fiddle with it some more
[15:28:33] <GeO`> ok
[15:30:18] <GeO`> I'm not used to fiddle
[15:30:22] <GeO`> I hope this is enough http://jsfiddle.net/qhD2L/
[15:31:08] <ngharo> thx
[15:31:21] <ngharo> added the css: http://jsfiddle.net/qhD2L/1/
[15:31:25] <djQuery> GeO: you forgot the link to the css file
[15:31:33] <ngharo> i really wish jsfiddle folks would add that as a dependancy
[15:31:40] <ngharo> automatically
[15:31:53] <GeO`> ag thanks
[15:32:13] <GeO`> jsfiddle is actually impressive
[15:32:17] <ngharo> GeO`: works here?  ui-state-active sticks onmouseout
[15:32:19] <ngharo> chrome
[15:32:34] <necromancer> GeO`: yeah works on firefox 5...
[15:32:39] <necromancer> =)
[15:32:45] <djQuery> ngharo: see ?jsbin
[15:32:46] <bot-t> ngharo, JS Bin - Collaborative JavaScript Debugging - http://jsbin.com/
[15:32:56] <djQuery> its in there by default
[15:33:13] <ngharo> djQuery: nice
[15:33:28] <ngharo> i really prefer jsfiddle layout for some reason
[15:33:33] <ngharo> maybe im just used to it
[15:33:52] <salazr> any one knows why jqueryui's slider() would create an empty div? aka. no slider.. classes added to div, but no content inside ..:/
[15:33:54] <GeO`> it's working too...there must be some difference with my environment
[15:34:15] <djQuery> ngharo: try typing var x = {"test": "this is a test" }; in jsbin
[15:34:28] <djQuery> then type x.t and hit the escape button
[15:35:10] <ngharo> oo neato
[15:35:21] <djQuery> salazr: nope not had it do that before. see ?demo
[15:35:21] <bot-t> salazr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:38:46] <salazr> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/nrm2T/  nothing special at all.. not sure what i am missing here.. this code is the demo on the slider() docs
[15:40:17] <ColKurtz> there isn't a horizontal accordion in jquery ui is there?
[15:40:18] <phishbot> anyone ever use Twig/Django + Mustache/Handlebars?
[15:40:35] <djQuery> salazr: evidently if you dont have the css it wont do anyting http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/nrm2T/3/  look under manage resources
[15:41:20] <ColKurtz> I pretty much need make this again: http://stonebrae.com/
[15:41:35] <ColKurtz> just wondering if somebody out there has coded it a better way
[15:41:37] <GeO`> alright it's working, but how can I turn it so that the active state is maintained only if it was lastly clicked ?
[15:41:42] <salazr> djQuery: lol thanks.. can't believe i missed that
[15:41:45] <GeO`> I tried that : http://jsfiddle.net/qhD2L/1/
[15:41:54] <djQuery> ColKurtz: dan remember workin on that
[15:42:05] <djQuery> damn rather
[15:42:08] <GeO`> but it doesn't work ofc
[15:42:26] <ColKurtz> yeah you helped out a bunch, thanks djQuery
[15:42:48] <djQuery> what are u changin now?
[15:43:08] <ColKurtz> new website
[15:46:30] <ColKurtz> djQuery, replacing the slideshow on http://lbso.org/ with a similar horizontal accordion
[15:50:09] <ColKurtz> how do you think using <img>s instead of background-images will work out?
[15:51:34] <djQuery> ColKurtz: hope theres not as many options
[15:51:41] <ColKurtz> there's 3
[15:51:51] <ColKurtz> well and a 4th sidebar
[15:51:58] <ColKurtz> i hope they don't want to animate that as well.
[15:52:18] <ColKurtz> they're restructuring the site
[15:52:21] <ColKurtz> for better IA
[15:55:16] <tom__> hello
[15:56:19] <tom__> I have a syntax question on jQuery
[15:58:09] <tom__>  $('input:text')       how do I modify this to include text boxes that have ids that contain "_req"  ??
[15:58:50] <tom__> $('input:text :contains(req)') does not seem to work
[16:00:07] <Fighter1405> Hey all, I'm using jQuery on my page and firebug is reporting this: http://pastebin.com/ffgLjjds Is this an actual error in jQuery or am I somehow using it wrong?
[16:02:51] <tom__> Fighter1405  ---  sometimes the order of your .js includes can cause this
[16:03:40] <Fighter1405> What's the correct order, tom__  ? jQuery first or last?
[16:04:14] <tom__> I think the core library first
[16:04:33] <tom__> then any additional, like jquery UI
[16:04:49] <tom__> just a guess
[16:04:53] <tom__> not an expert
[16:04:58] <Fighter1405> I'm not using any additional jQuery things, just the core library :(
[16:05:07] <Fighter1405> At the moment it includes jQuery, then my JS
[16:05:49] <tom__> possible to comment out surrounding HTML?
[16:05:58] <tom__> for example, just use the part that is failing?
[16:06:24] <tom__> sort of a "hello world" example that just has the erroring part?
[16:06:49] <Fighter1405> I'll have a look :)
[16:07:28] <tom__> you are welcome to send me the HTML and jquery you are using
[16:07:33] <tom__> I can have a look
[16:08:00] <tom__> my email is managebrinkster "aaaat" "yahoo" "dot" "com"
[16:08:20] <Fighter1405> Thanks, I'll try to cut it down first
[16:08:28] <tom__> sure
[16:08:33] <tom__> good luck!
[16:08:33] <Fighter1405> At the moment I have ~500 lines of JS, I doubt you want to read all that :-D
[16:08:41] <tom__> uuugh
[16:08:47] <tom__> are you writing a plug in?
[16:10:19] <Fighter1405> No, not at all
[16:10:23] <Fighter1405> Just using jQuery
[16:10:30] <tom__> I see
[16:10:43] <tom__> well, let me know if I can help...you have my email
[16:10:55] <Fighter1405> Thanks, I will do :-)
[16:11:07] <tom__> anyone:     $('input:text')       how do I modify this to include text boxes that have ids that contain "_req"  ??

[16:40:03] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am currently trying to create a layout that is newspaper-like but am using a pdf generator that has javascript support but no css3 support. Is there any plugin that would allow me to split a div's text up into two columns at a specific height?
[16:46:04] <saddishwasher> sdwrage, how does the pdf generator parse the content? is the end result plain text with line breaks or xml type format, or what? can you give a sample output of the generated text?
[16:51:22] <saddishwasher> hello?
[17:01:05] <tanner> how might I load a response from an ajax GET that returns a fragment of html and javascript into a <li> such that the javascript can execute?
[17:07:57] <K1ng`> can anyone help me with jquery validator please
[17:17:54] <luite> are the jquery-ui 1.9 milestones the way to go if you need features that are not available in 1.8?
[17:29:09] <dwarder> for some unknown reason remote autocomplete doesn't work, though url returns values perfectly but array as a source for autocomplelion does work,
[17:29:24] <dwarder> how can i find out
[17:29:55] <dwarder> doesn't work means doesn't show this autocomplete hints
[17:31:42] <kborchers> dwarder: what does your data look like from the remote source?
[17:34:25] <dwarder> kborchers: ['one','two','three'], if i just copy it as an array and use this array, autocompletion works ...
[17:34:40] <dwarder> use this array as a source
[17:35:15] <dwarder> btw i use autocomletion that comes with jquery UI
[17:35:21] <dwarder> latest version
[17:35:41] <djQuery> ColKurtz: css can center regular images as well.  margin: auto;
[17:36:07] <ColKurtz> but i'm absolutely positioning everything
[17:36:27] <ColKurtz> and the width of the image changes
[17:37:38] <dwarder> kborchers: could it be that my cms system sends two extra get params besides term
[17:38:51] <kborchers> dwarder: Try using json format like { source: ['one', 'two', 'three'] } for your returned data
[17:39:06] <kborchers> dwarder: going to switch from iPad to lapto
[17:39:14] <kborchers> Laptop, be right back
[17:39:24] <dwarder> ok thank, will try now
[17:39:28] <dwarder> thanks*
[17:40:42] <ColKurtz> i'll leave the images in the markup though set to display:None; and the same image set as the background
[17:40:55] <ColKurtz> that way I believe facebook et al. can pick up the images easier when linking
[17:41:38] <kborchers> back
[17:42:31] <dwarder> kborchers: same ... btw here are url params that are passed to the script that returns json: example.com/jsonreturn.php?callback=jQuery15103390000131294878_1311036027281&term=ON&_=1311036038204
[17:42:45] <sapph_> Is it possibe, using jquery or otherwise, to use jquery to send text over an arbitrary TCP port?
[17:43:06] <sapph_> *to use javascript
[17:43:13] <dwarder> kborchers: but using common sense they should hinder ...
[17:43:21] <dwarder> shouldn't*
[17:44:30] <kborchers> dwarder: can you post your autocomplete code or a link to your site? see ?p
[17:44:31] <bot-t> dwarder, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:45:17] <kborchers> dwarder: also, is this remote source on a different domain?
[17:45:44] <dwarder> kborchers: same domain
[17:45:59] <kborchers> dwarder: ok, at least rules that out, that's good
[17:45:59] <dwarder> hmm but i use full url
[17:46:08] <kborchers> dwarder: shouldn't matter
[17:46:10] <dwarder> let me try to use /myjsonscript
[17:46:16] <kborchers> ok
[17:46:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[17:46:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> looking for some help with this: http://www.machadodesign.com/client/exalt_home/markets-pluginVer.html in ie7
[17:47:16] <dwarder> didn't help
[17:48:38] <kborchers> dwarder: i'll need to get a look at the code i think. one other thing, in that json example i gave you, try putting quotes around source also
[17:49:26] <dwarder> { "source": ?
[17:49:38] <dwarder> trying
[17:49:39] <kborchers> right
[17:51:27] <dwarder> firebug gives me invalid label error
[17:51:47] <kborchers> dwarder: hmm, ok can you paste your code?
[17:52:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> how can i animate sub elements of a class when changing classes?
[17:52:37] <dwarder> kborchers: i have almost the same code working but not inside the cms, ..... i thing i have ["one","two" ... style there ... trying
[17:53:41] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: can you explain a little more. what exactly are you trying to do?
[17:54:00] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's just a fancy accordion
[17:54:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> what browser are you in?
[17:54:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> oh you mean my last question
[17:54:22] <ProLoser|Mobile> when i do addClass('someclass', 500);
[17:54:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> it will animate the element recieving the class, but if you have something like li.someclass a, the <a> will not be animated
[17:54:49] <sapph_> Is it possibe, using jquery or otherwise, to use javascrpt to send text over an arbitrary TCP port?
[17:54:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> it will just jump to it's final position
[17:54:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> unless this is a bug or no longer occurs
[17:54:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> let me make a fiddle
[17:56:07] <djQuery> sapph_: how many times u gonna ask the same way? what are u actualy trying to acomplish?
[17:56:25] <polarbear4> i am using jquery.timeago and when i console.log the date followed by the timeago text, it is clearly off. anybody know why? here are the results: http://pastebin.com/LzvGzwqs
[17:56:29] <djQuery> what port is the pagesd served?
[17:56:48] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: hmmm, i didn't realize you could add a duration to addClass. i don't see that in the docs
[17:57:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's in UI
[17:57:27] <djQuery> kborchers: its add by ui
[17:57:42] <kborchers> right, forgot about that.
[17:57:44] <sapph_> djQuery: No one answered the first time, so I waited what I felt like was an appropriate amount of time and asked again.  TiVos accept commands over TCP - text sent to a particular port.  I was trying to figure out if it was possible to build a script - and by extension a FireFox addon - that could control a TiVo.
[17:57:49] <djQuery> kborchers: see ?ui.toggleclass
[17:57:49] <bot-t> kborchers, Adds the specified class if it is not present, and removes the specified class if it is present, using an optional transition. http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggleClass/
[17:58:04] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/M4Srj/1/
[17:58:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> for some stupid reason i can't run this
[17:59:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> weird
[17:59:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> fiddle is broken
[17:59:32] <sapph_> I don't really need a stateful connection like I would in a normal telnet session - just text sent raw over TCP to a specific port.
[17:59:43] <snover> sapph_: firefox addon probably, everyday script no
[18:00:01] <codecab> ProLoser|Mobile: try toggleClass instead switchClass
[18:00:07] <sapph_> Snover: Aren't all firefox addons essentially packaged JS?
[18:00:12] <snover> sapph_: no.
[18:00:31] <snover> addons can have binary components. and they can also access apis that are not available to normal scripts.
[18:00:37] <ProLoser|Mobile> codecab: for some reason jsfiddle thinks the link to jquery is wrong
[18:01:07] <ProLoser|Mobile> does this work for anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/M4Srj/2/
[18:01:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> i have no idea why it's failing, i think it's source for jquery is broken or something
[18:01:33] <codecab> works here
[18:01:33] <sapph_> snover: Hrm. Do the binary components need to be Java?
[18:01:35] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: works for me if i replace switchclass with toggleclass
[18:01:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> i can't get the damn thing to load
[18:02:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> kborchers: if you click on it, does it animate?
[18:02:36] <snover> sapph_: whaaaaaaaaat? why would you think that?
[18:02:44] <djQuery> sapph_: can you give an example of the data that needs to be sent
[18:02:54] <codecab> ProLoser|Mobile: can u reach that url? http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[18:03:01] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: no, just toggles. again, i don't see in the docs where you can pass a duration to toggleClass. and switch class requires 3 args, removeClass, addClass and duration
[18:03:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> i can now
[18:03:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> but in the inspector it is failing
[18:03:27] <kborchers> now it animates
[18:03:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's going on?
[18:04:12] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: change to jquery 1.5.2 and ui 1.8.9. ui does not support 1.6.x yet
[18:04:42] <kborchers> or you can add ui 1.8.14 via resources
[18:04:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> thank you
[18:04:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> that fixed it, but it still proves my point
[18:04:57] <sapph_> djQuery: For example, sending IRCODE ASPECT_CORRECTION_PANEL [followed by a carriage return] over port 31339.  If you open a telnet session to your TiVo to that port, and send that command, it will do exactly what it looks like it will do.  But it is tedious to open a telnet session everytime I want to do something, and to remember all the commands.
[18:04:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> notice how the box resizes but the text does not
[18:05:12] <kborchers> i do, let me play a minute
[18:06:06] <ProLoser|Mobile> i have a plugin i wrote that i wish to animate several items, except instead of passing each item it's manual settings, i've been setting the container to an 'active' class, but because of this effect, it doesn't work
[18:06:27] <ProLoser|Mobile> so i have had to do $('li *').addClass()
[18:06:32] <ProLoser|Mobile> which is horrible on performance

[18:09:10] <sapph_> djQuery: Did you grok that? I wasn't sure if I was saying it clearly.
[18:10:30] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: does this help. a little tweek to your selector and your css http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/M4Srj/4/
[18:10:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> kborchers: that only goes 1 level deep right?
[18:11:08] <kborchers> ys
[18:11:09] <kborchers> yes
[18:11:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> is children more efficient than say > *
[18:11:33] <djQuery> sapph_: yes I understand just dont think it can be done
[18:11:38] <systemfault> ProLoser|Mobile: Where's the bottleneck on your website?
[18:11:42] <kborchers> i think so, but you can always jsperf your particular situation since that can effect it
[18:12:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> systemfault: i'm debugging 2 separate problems, which are you referring to? the performance issue on the plugin?
[18:12:04] <djQuery> you would think they would come with a built in webserver like routers do
[18:12:10] <systemfault> ProLoser|Mobile: Yes.

[18:15:25] <systemfault> I mean.. where's the performance problem? It doesn't seem to be related to your code since you don't seem to have any code :'(
[18:15:36] <systemfault> You're talking about addClass and selectors..

[18:46:39] <wesbos> sacrebleu what are you trying to grab?
[18:46:46] <sacrebleu> the content of the page
[18:46:53] <ryanseddon> cause it's a cross origin call which isn't allowed
[18:46:57] <wesbos> yeah
[18:47:02] <sacrebleu> cross origin?
[18:47:26] <ryanseddon> sacrebleu: I assume you're requesting the page from another domain?

[18:47:34] <sacrebleu> ryanseddon no actually
[18:47:42] <wesbos> are you building a plugin then?
[18:48:52] <ryanseddon> sacrebleu: I just tried you're code then on google.com and it worked
[18:49:20] <ocf> any idea why var msg = $("#message").val() isn't getting the value out of a textarea inside of a jquery UI dialog?
[18:50:17] <sacrebleu> ryanseddon, maybe its the SSL
[18:51:01] <wesbos> ocf is #message the id of the dialog or the text area?

[18:53:44] <sacrebleu> its ok as long as i just specify a relative url
[18:53:49] <sacrebleu> i think it is due to SSL

[18:55:08] <matter> Hey guys, I need to do something similar that this website: http://www.bokicabo.com/en/04/, I have fullscreen image that need to be resize depending the browser size and when I click on a link it needs to scroll Up and/ or Down...any ideas, plugins...cheers
[18:55:13] <ocf> $("#message").length = 1, so I know the element exists
[18:55:28] <ocf> if I use firebug/chrome dev to inspect the textarea, I'm seeing an ID of "message", as expected
[19:01:15] <Marduk2> hello i have a question.. i am trying to create an on change event for a form select, i already did, and i can get the value using $(this).attr('value'), but how do i get the description in the option?' i want to get the text between the <option value="x">this text</option> any ideas?'
[19:01:38] <ekkis> should I be able to hit any url from $.ajax()?
[19:02:03] <saddishwasher> Marduk2: first of all, use $(this).val() to get the value
[19:03:53] <kborchers> Marduk2: try $(this).children(":selected").text();
[19:04:53] <saddishwasher> kborchers++
[19:06:07] <ejo> I'm still trying to figure out how to add a section of javascript to a page using AJAX.  Everything I have tried results in js that works, but is not visible as script in Firebug.  It shows up when I inspect the HTML of the page, but it doesn't become accessible to Firebug's script pane and debugger.  Is this just a limitation of Firebug?
[19:06:39] <Marduk2> kborchers, it worked thankss!!
[19:07:11] <kborchers> ?np @ Marduk2
[19:07:12] <bot-t> Marduk2, No Problem
[19:07:43] <coldhead> what happens in chrome's web inspector, ejo ?
[19:07:57] <coldhead> i have never seen that behaviour in firebug
[19:08:59] <ejo> Same thing in chrome (chromium actually, I'm on Linux).  Script gets loaded, it's visible in the html right where I placed it.  And I can call the functions in it and they work.  So functionally this is all OK.  But in the web inspector's Scripts tab the newly loaded stuff doesn't show up as a script.
[19:09:27] <coldhead> ah it isn't a script
[19:09:37] <coldhead> those are all external scripts
[19:09:45] <coldhead> and inline stuff doesn't count as such
[19:10:09] <ejo> I tried placing a <script type="text/javascript" src="url to my script"></script> into the DOM too.
[19:10:13] <ejo> That results in the same thing
[19:11:04] <ejo> Or actually one way I tried it, the DOM (or the browser or something?) stripped the <script></script> tags and stuffed the rest into the DOM as text.
[19:11:09] <coldhead> oh you mean you add them later?
[19:11:14] <coldhead> dynamically?
[19:11:21] <ejo> that is what I want to do, yes
[19:11:24] <coldhead> i think the scripts tab just works off the initial pageload
[19:11:34] <ejo> I'd like to reduce the initial page load by adding some script only if certain user actions take place.
[19:11:48] <ejo> bleah, really?  So no one has a debugger for script loaded later?
[19:11:48] <coldhead> yes, with yepnope.js or similar?
[19:11:58] <ekkis> could someone look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/aQhHK/ ?
[19:12:00] <coldhead> you can still do SOME debugging
[19:12:08] <ejo> don't know what you mean about yepnope.js or similar
[19:12:12] <coldhead> but not in the scripts tab i believe
[19:12:15] <ekkis> it's very simple but it doesn't work... I'm wondering what I'm missing
[19:12:24] <coldhead> http://yepnopejs.com/
[19:12:28] <coldhead> it's a conditional loader
[19:12:31] <ejo> I just want to set breakpoints and step thru and watch vars.  guess that won't happen
[19:12:34] <coldhead> and you're talking about conditional loading
[19:12:49] <ejo> oh, i see.  yeah, just did the conditional loading myself, didn't seem hard enough to need a plugin or anything
[19:12:55] <ejo> just a couple lines of js + jquery
[19:13:08] <ejo> does yepnope do something of extra benefit?
[19:13:11] <coldhead> hmm in my chromium i see stuff added with document.write(), not with $.getScript()
[19:13:29] <coldhead> ejo: it lets you do quite complicated conditions if you need to
[19:13:33] <ejo> hmm so maybe if I receive the data using $.ajax() or whatever, then document.write it?
[19:13:42] <ejo> mmkay, that's good to know about yepnope thx
[19:13:47] <coldhead> that sounds like a bad way to do it :(
[19:13:57] <coldhead> ejo: ask in #chromium perhaps
[19:14:00] <ejo> yeah, I'd like to never use document.write() for anything at all
[19:14:01] <ekkis> it's a simple ajax call I'm trying to make but it's made to another domain... it's the first time I do it and it doesn't work... could anyone look?
[19:14:09] <coldhead> or paul_irish if you can find him
[19:14:15] <GeoDud> @ejo I googled, sounds like this is a recurring bug in FF5's Firebug: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/858779/making-firebug-break-inside-dynamically-loaded-javascript
[19:14:18] <ejo> coldhead: I'll give that a shot, thanks!  ... yeah I'll bet he'd know too
[19:14:23] <ekkis> you can take the url and pull it up on the browser you'll see it returns a Json array
[19:14:29] <GeoDud> @ejo dunno if there is a working solution
[19:14:48] <ejo> oh yeah? i'll follow that thx GeoDud
[19:14:53] <GeoDud> np, GL
[19:15:00] <coldhead> ekkis: you can't do AJAX across domains
[19:15:03] <ejo> coulda sworn I used to be able to do this somewhere back in FF4

[19:15:24] <GeoDud> well supposedly it was fixed in an earlier FF release but it may be broken again(?)
[19:16:45] <coldhead> good googling, GeoDud
[19:18:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[19:19:15] <ejo> meh... #chromium is asleep
[19:19:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> ejo: os or browser?
[19:19:27] <coldhead> browser nerds, man
[19:19:32] <coldhead> USELESS
[19:19:40] <ejo> browser
[19:21:33] <ejo> Looks like as long as I'm debugging I'll just have to load all my javascript at page load.  Later on once I know it's well tested I can break it up and load dynamically :P
[19:22:55] <coldhead> that's not a terrible strategy
[19:23:13] <ejo> I really can't call it too bad
[19:23:16] <ejo> ha
[19:23:29] <coldhead> also your clients will be impressed with how you can radically improve performance!
[19:23:34] <ejo> that's no worse than having non-minified js in development and minified/compressed in production.
[19:23:46] <ejo> ha.  you mean between demo and delivery?  sure thing :)
[19:23:58] <ejo> i'll be like, "wait'll you see what I did with a little caching!"

[19:32:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm looking for some tips on how i could code my plugin animations
[19:33:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> i tried to make it more versatile by putting the 'active' class into my css file and then using ui to animate to that class, but it doesn't animate children. How would you go about making children elements animate properly? Should I let the user submit an object of css attributes for the plugin to animate to and drop the whole css class altogether?
[19:34:16] <ProLoser|Mobile> also, if I let the user pass an object, how do i let the dev change animations attributes of children?
[19:40:16] <hariom> Hi, I want to know how to create callback. The situation is like this: I have a div that is hidden on document ready. A button click event (lets says fun1 is button click event), displays that div and needs to wait for the action taken on this div before it executes rest of the statements. div which is displayed just now has two buttons, 'submit' and 'cancel'. On submit button click, I fire an ajax to send some data and sets a global flag and on cancel bu
[19:40:16] <hariom> tton, I just hide the div again and sets the same global flag. What I don't know is how to jump from submit/cancel execution to back to the fun1 which is waiting to execute rest of the statements based on the value set in global flag variable.
[19:40:32] <ProLoser|Mobile> hariom: paulirish calls them 'hollabacks'
[19:41:29] <ProLoser|Mobile> hariom: you want to execute something at the end of submit/cancel? i don't quite follow
[19:41:43] <hariom> ProLoser: yea
[19:41:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> if you're not waiting for animations or ajax, just add the call to whatever else at the end of the primary function
[19:41:46] <hariom> right
[19:42:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> if it's ajax or animations, read the api about passing a callback fn argument to the end
[19:42:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> you can also, optionally, programmatically 'simulate' an event by calling the trigger method, which will fire off whatever events are binded to that element's trigger
[19:43:29] <hariom> fun1 shows a div and should to wait executing statements before any action is taken on the displayed div.
[19:43:36] <jaypitidi> Is it possible to use jquery library(parent) in an iframe? Currently I am loading jquery once in the parent and once in the iframe. I'd love to only have it loaded once.
[19:44:39] <hariom> ProLoser|Mobile: I am actually trying to create my own dialog box with submit and cancel button instead of adding a plugin.
[19:45:55] <hariom> Dialog box is nothing but a div that already exists but is hidden. When a event happens I show that div to simulate like a dialog and have submit and cancel buttons on it.
[19:46:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> okay, but what are you trying to stop from executing?
[19:46:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> you're trying to simulate a real app too closely. in an app, some big action happens, but you get prompted 50% through
[19:46:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> in this scenario, your action is a: prompt, and then the response causes action b: complete action
[19:47:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> long story short, put your action code inside the 'continue' button. end of story
[19:47:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> if you think about it, that action code will never execute unless the continue button is pressed, and that's all that matters, the rest is needless complication
[19:47:45] <hariom> When I show the div that acts like dialog box, I have statements to execute below showing the div. But I want these statements to run only after one of the event like submit button click or cancel button click happens
[19:49:19] <ProLoser|Mobile> hariom: so put the statements in a function, and only call the function if submit is clicked
[19:49:26] <hariom> It is something like: fun1 -> Show div -> [show submit button, show cancel button] if submit: set a global flag else if cancel set the same global flag. When either submit/cancel happens, execute remaining of fun1.
[19:50:29] <circle_> can you create a new script element with an id?
[19:50:36] <circle_> then remove that script element by id?
[19:50:50] <circle_> such as document.createElement( 'script' );
[19:50:58] <circle_> if you set that as the object script
[19:51:03] <circle_> then script.id = 'mynewid';
[19:51:11] <circle_> then $('#mynewid').remove();
[19:51:19] <circle_> but it doesn't seem to work.
[19:51:20] <circle_> hmm
[19:51:54] <hariom> ProLoser|Mobile: right I can do that but submit should not execute only one function everytime. If fun1 that shows the div, is not fixed. There are fun1, fun2 fun3 that all have show div capability. and submit action should run the remaining code of respective functions (i.e. fun1 or fun2 or fun3 )
[19:53:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> ya you're doing a crappy job of explaining your workflow lol
[19:53:28] <hariom> looks like that.
[19:54:16] <hariom> Well, in a way, I want to run a function (which is not hardcoded ) upon completion of the submit click event.
[19:55:04] <ProLoser|Mobile> okay, and the normal way to do that is put the function in the click event of the submit button
[19:55:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> that's pretty spelled out, even by your own notes
[19:56:30] <EvanDonovan> how would i set the value of a <select> element by its position in the list, rather than by value?
[19:57:08] <EvanDonovan> i.e., i want to programmatically set the <select> element to the first one in the list (which is dynamically generated), and then trigger the change event
[19:57:20] <EvanDonovan> something like, $('#edit-panes-billing-billing-address-select').val(1).trigger('change');
[19:57:45] <EvanDonovan> but i need to know what to put into .val(), since 1 would be the value, not the position in the list
[19:57:57] <hariom> ProLoser|Mobile: Let me try once again explaining it better     [fun1 or fun2 or fun3 ] -> show div -> [submit button, cancel button]. This part is done.    Now if submit click -> run submit ajax and go to remaining of the respective [fun1 or fun2 or fun3]. Same should be the case with cancel.
[19:58:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> EvanDonovan:  you try google? i could devise a way off the top fo my head, but it seems inefficient and jquery may have a fn for it already lol
[19:59:16] <EvanDonovan> i am looking right now, but haven't found anything yet
[19:59:24] <EvanDonovan> ProLoser|Mobile: if you have an idea, go ahead
[19:59:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1280499/jquery-set-select-index
[19:59:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> I googled "jquery set select value by index"
[20:00:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> $('#selectBox option').eq(3).attr('selected', 'selected');
[20:00:25] <hariom> I can enclose the remainings of fun1 or fun2 or fun3 in a separate function and execute that in submit but then I would have to pass all the variables of fun1 or fun2 or fun3 with that so the execution can work on them.
[20:00:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> heh, i woulda just set tvalue but i guess setting the attribute works, seems like it might break though if you do it more than once, not sure lol
[20:02:00] <hariom> ProLoser|Mobile: Is there a way to set callback on submit button click? This callback will be called once the submit completes
[20:02:25] <kborchers> ?submit @ hariom
[20:02:25] <bot-t> hariom, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[20:02:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> kborchers: he's not using a form submit (I think)
[20:03:06] <EvanDonovan> ProLoser|Mobile: i have to set the attribute b/c the value is a serialized json array
[20:03:18] <EvanDonovan> it is a bit weird, but i didn't write the code that i am interacting with
[20:03:33] <EvanDonovan> i think your option is actually as efficient as what i just found
[20:04:51] <sevenpluseight> hey guys, does anyone know a way I can take links from a video site like youtube, and have a srcript that would create a thumbnail and put them in a table with description, and time?
[20:04:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> is it appropriate to use end() after using children() ?
[20:06:36] <kborchers> ProLoser|Mobile: hmm, i don't think so because children is a selector not a filter
[20:06:48] <EvanDonovan> ProLoser|Mobile: brilliant, it worked. thank you. i had to still append .trigger('change') on the end though in order to trigger the onchange event for the option
[20:07:00] <EvanDonovan> it pre-populates an ubercart billing address in Drupal

[20:29:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> do i have to do .each()?
[20:29:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> cuIDoi: depends on everything lol
[20:30:17] <ProLoser|Mobile> cuIDoi: you could also use display: none instead of hide()
[20:30:37] <ProLoser|Mobile> in the end it's all about whichever option gives you better performance, or how crucial/secure the information is
[20:31:08] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: whats the difference with display: none?
[20:31:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> you don't have to wait for js to load for it to take effect :)
[20:31:37] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: thats via css?
[20:32:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> yes
[20:32:47] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: usually js is in head section of page so its loaded when page is loaded ;)
[20:33:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> that's poor design
[20:33:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[20:34:10] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: nope. because if js is turned off then i want it to show full page anyway so display: none is wrong
[20:34:29] <ProLoser|Mobile> ... whatever
[20:35:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> wow, congratulations jquery: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=animated#sclient=psy&hl=en&safe=off&source=hp&q=animate&pbx=1&oq=animate&aq=f&aqi=g-e5&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=1378l1378l0l1623l1l1l0l0l0l0l185l185l0.1l1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=39b0a615b729321b&biw=1172&bih=933
[20:36:37] <Shai-Tan> How can I get the exception message from an error function? eg: success: function(data){ alert('good'); } error: function(){ alert('I need the exception mesage here'); }
[20:36:44] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: thanks for the link though because thats the only thing useful i got from you ;)
[20:36:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> way to be a dipshit
[20:37:20] <cuIDoi> ProLoser|Mobile: right back at ya ;)
[20:37:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> ya i try to help you and you just give me shit, i think you're a bit confused boy
[20:38:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> rule #1 of irc is generally don't insult the people trying to help you
[20:38:26] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2626367/any-hosted-versions-of-jquery-that-have-the-access-control-allow-origin-head -- anyone know that one should answer it... :)  Its asked forever ago

[20:40:25] <gnarf> cuIDoi: CSS Rule: .hasJS .myClass { display: none } --- JS: $("html").addClass("hasJS")
[20:40:55] <danieliser> i have a func on click for all divs that uses .post() and then replaces itself.. i need the new div to be clickable also so i call the function again.. issue im getting is its stacking the function twice so the .post returns twice and the div gets added more than once.
[20:41:15] <gnarf> danieliser: see ?p
[20:41:15] <bot-t> danieliser, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:41:52] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: rule #1 of IRC, people are douches
[20:42:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm aware, i'm moving on lol
[20:42:07] <gnarf> :)
[20:43:05] <gnarf> danieliser: you might want to see ?live too
[20:43:06] <bot-t> danieliser, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[20:43:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> gnarf: is there a way to scope jquery.disableanimations or whatever it's called
[20:43:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> so i can turn them off for just my plugin?
[20:43:34] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: um
[20:43:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> rather than lacing my code with if statements, etc
[20:43:57] <ProLoser|Mobile> would be a nifty addition :)
[20:44:06] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: got a code example?
[20:44:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> uh
[20:44:27] <gnarf> jQuery.fx.off effectively sets all animation durations to 0
[20:44:30] <gnarf> just FYI
[20:44:33] <gnarf> thats all it really does
[20:44:54] <gnarf> so you could easily do .fadeIn( animated ? duration : 0 )
[20:45:16] <gnarf> so kinda
[20:45:20] <gnarf> but it requires some planning
[20:45:31] <gnarf> if you use a variable to store your duration, you can set it to 0
[20:45:36] <gnarf> and emulate .fx.off
[20:46:16] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://pastebin.com/8KpGVR6X
[20:46:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> interesting idea
[20:46:41] <gnarf> yeah, set base.options.animationTime = 0
[20:46:59] <gnarf> and those all basicaly become .css( {} ) instead of .animate( {} )
[20:47:04] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/sebPg/
[20:47:04] <gnarf> although they actually set css twice
[20:47:13] <matter> Hello, any good tutorial to use the ScrollTo Plugin : )
[20:47:33] <gnarf> the perf for setting the css is near nothing
[20:48:14] <gnarf> that chain is ugly
[20:48:32] <gnarf> save the $page rather .end()'ng back to it each time
[20:48:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> brainfart: is this valid syntax? duration = (animate) ? base.options.animationTime : 0;
[20:49:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> gnarf: actually i used to restart from $page each time lol, but i added the ends in
[20:49:05] <gnarf> dont need the () around animate
[20:49:26] <gnarf> I think $page reads better
[20:49:30] <gnarf> end gets lost in that chain
[20:49:41] <gnarf> its also one less function call
[20:50:22] <gnarf> duration = ( animate && base.options.animationTime ) || 0
[20:50:32] <gnarf> when animate is truthy, use the animationTime
[20:50:35] <gnarf> otherwise use 0
[20:50:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> better? http://pastebin.com/aUs5rfwT
[20:51:00] <gnarf> or animate ? base.options.animationTime : 0
[20:51:21] <ProLoser|Mobile> gnarf: i thought that's what i had to begin with?
[20:51:30] <ProLoser|Mobile> minue the paren
[20:51:37] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: it was
[20:51:42] <gnarf> both would work
[20:51:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> i find it a little bit more legible than animate && base.options
[20:52:10] <gnarf> the conditional operator (?:) is prolly more straightfoward what you want anyway
[20:52:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> do coding standards scoff at using it?
[20:52:17] <danieliser> any ideas how to keep the function from running twice when they click on one?
[20:52:24] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: depends on who you ask
[20:52:36] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: javascript ninjas like ternaries and optis
[20:52:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> gnarf: in cakephp, they don't like it in the core
[20:52:49] <ProLoser|Mobile> gnarf: i'm merely referring to the coding standards for jquery plugins
[20:53:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> not peoples opinions, i realize those can get a bit... ambiguous
[20:53:06] <coldhead> javascript ninjas like child pornography
[20:53:08] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[20:53:17] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding-standards
[20:53:38] <cuIDoi> coldhead: wow! i bet you do as well.
[20:53:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> i don't see anything about it explicitly
[20:53:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> danieliser: use a flag? may want to describe what you're doing
[20:54:08] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: thats my point
[20:54:11] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: now
[20:54:12] <danieliser> i did above..
[20:54:14] <danieliser> i have a func on click for all divs that uses .post() and then replaces itself.. i need the new div to be clickable also so i call the function again.. issue im getting is its stacking the function twice so the .post returns twice and the div gets added more than once.
[20:54:19] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/sebPg/
[20:54:26] <gnarf> if you end up writing a something ? something : something ? something : something
[20:54:29] <gnarf> you might wanna think twice
[20:54:34] <ProLoser|Mobile> actually
[20:54:43] <gnarf> but i use that for my "clamp" function in jquery-color
[20:54:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> i think i remember listening to yayquery they found something like that in the core and found it CLEANER
[20:54:55] <coldhead> politicians lie in cast iron sinks
[20:54:57] <gnarf> val < min ? min : val > max ? max : val
[20:55:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm going back to work now lol
[20:55:43] <gnarf> the ui guys would prefer seeing if () { return } if () { return } return
[20:55:46] <gnarf> which i think is silly
[20:56:12] <gnarf> but they aim for readability
[20:56:25] <versatiletech> gnarf: O.o
[20:56:29] <cuIDoi> coldhead: you got anymore one liners?
[20:57:30] <danieliser> any ideas how to only assign the function to each div once
[20:58:14] <gnarf> danieliser: yes
[20:58:28] <gnarf> danieliser: lemme make sure i understand what you're doing first tho
[20:58:34] <coldhead> all things that are, are lights
[20:58:54] <danieliser> gnarf: need me to explain it better?
[20:58:59] <gnarf> you are making a <form> element appended to #container , and the using .load() to get the form html from the server
[20:59:03] <gnarf> in the callback
[20:59:15] <gnarf> you are selecting all $("#container .input_control") and attaching an even
[20:59:16] <ProLoser|Mobile> is $.extend() recursive?
[20:59:29] <cuIDoi> coldhead: yes thats wonderful.
[20:59:32] <gnarf> your problem is that $("#container .input_control") is finding the controls that were already there, and bound....
[20:59:34] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: no
[20:59:50] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: there is a recursiveish .extend hiding in jquery ui core somewhere i think
[20:59:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> lol
[20:59:59] <gnarf> for extending options arrays
[21:00:08] <danieliser> correct.. but once its submitted once the function is called again any following clicked div loads twice
[21:00:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> sounds like factory
[21:00:13] <gnarf> i remember helping scott write it
[21:00:15] <danieliser> i have a full example..
[21:00:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> widgetfactory
[21:00:17] <ProLoser|Mobile> or whatever
[21:00:17] <gnarf> maybe
[21:00:28] <gnarf> you might be able to rip the fn
[21:00:34] <gnarf> for your use
[21:00:46] <gnarf> danieliser: nah, that little example is enough
[21:00:51] <gnarf> lemme mod yer code here a bit
[21:01:41] <danieliser> gnarf since the load gets called twice the modal gets appended twice
[21:02:55] <gnarf> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/sebPg/1/
[21:03:20] <gnarf> now the #submit and #click events should proabably be moved out of that code
[21:03:24] <gnarf> unless they are "per form"
[21:03:29] <gnarf> in which case you have a problem
[21:03:35] <gnarf> because HTML ID's are unique
[21:03:45] <gnarf> you need to use a class instead of an ID to select them
[21:03:46] <coldhead> ?mlu
[21:03:46] <bot-t> much like urself
[21:03:51] <danieliser> the form gets removed after submit..
[21:03:53] <coldhead> damn too slow
[21:04:01] <gnarf> and also use the form.find(".Submit")
[21:04:28] <gnarf> i added some comments to the fiddle
[21:04:32] <gnarf> lemme know if that makes sense
[21:05:04] <versatiletech> ?help
[21:05:04] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[21:05:46] <gnarf> and you should use form.submit() instead of a click on the submit button
[21:05:48] <gnarf> fyi
[21:06:02] <gnarf> better event
[21:06:05] <versatiletech> ?bot
[21:06:05] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[21:06:33] * bot-t slaps versatiletech around a bit with a large trout
[21:06:45] <versatiletech> lol
[21:06:57] <versatiletech> bot gots jokes
[21:07:05] <danieliser> see the form isnt in the html at all times.. gets loaded via load..and if i remove the call to mkEdiatable() from the .post complete function the form functions fine on all elements except the newly replaced ones
[21:07:17] <bot-t> much like urself
[21:07:59] <gnarf> danieliser: okay, if you aren't going to read my code and the comments and tell me what I didn't understand or what you don't understand I'm not going to be able to help you
[21:08:33] <gnarf> i understand your form is ajaxed in
[21:08:45] <gnarf> and i understand you're adding events to the newly added elements in the load callback
[21:08:50] <gnarf> but you are adding events to ALL elements
[21:08:53] <gnarf> not just newly added ones
[21:09:12] <gnarf> hence, don't search the whole document using $(), use form.find( selector ) instead
[21:09:21] <gnarf> and skip the "#container" part of the selector, its pointless
[21:10:02] <gnarf> i.e. $("#container .input_control") finds all of them
[21:10:17] <gnarf> where form.find(".input_control") finds only the ones inside "form" which is the content you just loaded
[21:10:33] <gnarf> and attach the events to that smaller set
[21:10:34] <danieliser> there is only one of them.. thats can be removed entirely and it still doesnt work
[21:11:06] <gnarf> danieliser: well, its a design issue in that part of your code
[21:11:17] <gnarf> i imagine it is also a design issue wherever else you are binding this event
[21:11:26] <danieliser> ok.. i get that..
[21:11:44] <gnarf> what I'm say is - only search the 'new content'
[21:11:56] <gnarf> maybe see ?newContent
[21:11:56] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[21:12:03] <danieliser> gnarf: maybe pass the target as a variable to mkEditable
[21:12:30] <gnarf> how about
[21:12:34] <gnarf> $.fn.mkEditable
[21:12:45] <gnarf> then you can $("div.sort div").mkEditable
[21:12:56] <gnarf> and inside the function -- this === $("div.sort div")
[21:12:56] <danieliser> extend jquery.. better idea..
[21:13:11] <gnarf> just remember to "each"
[21:13:14] <gnarf> if you need to
[21:13:35] <gnarf> cuz you can have more than one element matched in the selector
[21:14:33] * bot-t tickles coldhead
[21:15:17] * coldhead squeals coquettishly
[21:16:09] * gnarf giggles
[21:16:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> i got a question
[21:16:23] <gnarf> good for you!
[21:16:26] <gnarf> ;)
[21:16:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> i have a bunch of li's, i want the user to set data-bg="some/file/path.jpg"
[21:16:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> and then i want to iterate through all the li's, using that property to set their css background
[21:16:53] <gnarf> um
[21:16:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> to do this, do I have to use .each() or is there a set-approach?
[21:17:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> i also only want to do this if the property is actually set
[21:17:47] <danieliser> gnarf: ty vm.. targeting worked.. on dom ready i call it with a select * method.. on recall i select the newly created item only..
[21:17:50] <gnarf> $("li[data-bg]").each(function() { var li = $(this); li.css('backgroundImage', 'url('+li.data('bg')+')' ); });
[21:17:54] <danieliser> works good now
[21:18:02] <gnarf> ProLoser|Mobile: next?
[21:18:39] <ProLoser|Mobile> heh cool was about to write that myself
[21:19:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> thanks
[21:20:07] <gnarf> I'm out
[21:20:09] <gnarf> need sleep
[21:20:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> aw
[21:20:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> i had 1 last question
[21:20:16] <gnarf> coldhead: keep em entertained
[21:20:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> not code related
[21:20:21] <ProLoser|Mobile> necessarily
[21:20:24] <gnarf> be quick
[21:20:32] <gnarf> i'll answer in ~5
[21:20:37] <ProLoser|Mobile> has anyone dev'd a github post hook for minifying your js?
[21:20:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> instead of doing it locally?
[21:21:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> i figure since github supports service hooks would be cool if you could just add a js-minifier one and it does it for you
[21:21:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> to your project on gh i mean
[21:24:49] <gnarf> i don't put .min in my repo
[21:25:12] <gnarf> but you could easily use a deploy hook
[21:25:19] <gnarf> to have a server check it out
[21:25:20] <gnarf> run make
[21:25:22] <gnarf> and up
[21:25:34] <gnarf> and i think something like that is how the jQuery (edge) build works
[21:28:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> interesting. I thought it would be cool if people could easily add that to their repos
[21:28:32] <gnarf> its not so hard if you have a webserver
[21:28:47] <gnarf> i've made branches that auto-deply
[21:28:51] <gnarf> and its a lot easier than you think
[21:29:04] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's more for consumers who are noobs
[21:29:12] <ProLoser|Mobile> aka, if i don't min, they don't min
[21:29:25] <gnarf> newb consumers prolly aren't using github? :)
[21:29:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> if you're smart, your download links are directly to github :)
[21:30:13] <gnarf> my .min isn't going to be in my repo
[21:30:27] <gnarf> .min is the result of building my repo
[21:41:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> wow

[21:59:42] <tash> I'm coming from the dojo world, can someone point me in the right direction to make a "pretty" jquery form.  Plugin suggestions or anything are welcome
[22:02:02] <versatiletech> ?g jquery pretty forms @ tash
[22:02:02] <bot-t> tash, 15 jQuery Plugins to enhance your HTML form elements - http://www.dreamcss.com/2009/05/15-jquery-plugins-to-enhance-your-html.html
[22:03:32] <tash> I tried jqtransform, but something didn't work right. I tried the example here: http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ but my form still looks like plain jane ...
[22:04:09] <styol> heres another one http://uniformjs.com/
[22:05:21] <tash> styol: nice, I think I may try that
[22:13:52] <tash> styol: bummer, it doesn't style input type="text" ?
[22:15:00] <styol> tash: i don't believe so, perhaps css can help a little bit
[22:16:21] <tash> yeah, probably ... problem is I'm a backend dude and don't have much time to learn some of this design stuff
[22:16:26] <tash> hrm, i'll keep looking
[22:16:44] <tash> I liked the jqtransform one ... but like I said it didn't work right
[22:17:15] <tash> the .min.js file which the example says is required didn't seem to be in the zip
[22:20:26] <circle_> anyone have any idea how to createElement type <script> then assign a id.
[22:20:35] <circle_> Then later remove that element by referencing the id
[22:20:42] <coldhead> matter: it may be because #page2 is already visible
[22:20:51] <circle_> i honestly don't think you can createElement('script'); and assign it an id
[22:20:56] <circle_> it just doesn't work for the <script> tag
[22:21:11] <coldhead> or it may be because they have different CSS properties, like display:block vs display:inline
[22:35:20] <coldhead> lol donald_cook
[22:44:20] <Gates> If the website has an imagine map of a navigation, because it has to be and there wants to be a sub menu on hover of select maps, what would be an easy way to achieve this?
[22:45:36] <coldhead> absolutely positioned hidden uls containing the submenus
[22:45:53] <coldhead> show/hide on mouseover/mouseout
[22:50:25] * coldhead np: stereolab - lo boob oscillator
[22:52:39] <Gates> coldhead: thnx
[22:56:22] <nickeldeuce> anyone know of a way to iterate over all elements that either have background image set or are img's?
[22:56:24] <nickeldeuce> :|
[22:56:50] <coldhead> ?each
[22:56:50] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[22:56:54] <coldhead> or
[22:56:59] <coldhead> ?map
[22:56:59] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[22:57:12] <coldhead> or um
[22:57:15] <coldhead> ?filter
[22:57:15] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[22:58:53] <nickeldeuce> well sure, but is there an easy way to test existence of background-image? without calling .css(background-image) a bajillion times
[22:59:01] <coldhead> no
[22:59:06] <coldhead> sadly not :(
[22:59:29] <coldhead> you could wrap your filter() up into a plugin and next time someone asked it would be easy for THEM
[22:59:32] <coldhead> but for you :(
[22:59:59] <nickeldeuce> well, I mean fast more than easy but i see your point
[23:00:36] <coldhead> yeah there's no native browser query for it or anything
[23:00:44] <nickeldeuce> k
[23:01:53] <nickeldeuce> other question: suppose some background-image was set; is their anything exposed to JS so you could compute what portion of the element was painted with the background image?
[23:02:05] <nickeldeuce> I don't know the JS bindings.. :(
[23:03:42] <coldhead> i doubt there is such a thing
[23:03:49] <coldhead> i've never seen it
[23:04:13] <coldhead> you might want to ask in ##css or check css specs to see if that info is supposed to be exposed somewhere
[23:04:18] <coldhead> but i doubt it
[23:06:01] <coldhead> no quick wins for you today huh :(
[23:17:21] <nickeldeuce> coldhead: at least I have jquery. :)
[23:23:39] <HelloWorld> how i make a unique 'random' id with numbersa and letters with jquery?
[23:24:26] <systemfault> HelloWorld: Good for a uuid implementation in JS, should be very easy to find.
[23:24:34] <systemfault> s/Good/Google
[23:26:02] <systemfault> ?eval 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {var r =  Math.random()*16|0,v=c=='x'?r:r&0x3|0x8;return v.toString(16);});
[23:26:03] <bot-t> systemfault: "efdbcc49-2259-4eae-99eb-910a14c8f75d"
[23:26:05] <systemfault> :D
[23:27:44] <poppiez> I have a div with overflow: auto; which means it's not all the elements in the div you can see. I want to know what divs are visible when done scrolling (ie. visible to the eye). is there a way to do this?
[23:29:45] <coldhead> ?eval jQuery.guid*(
[23:29:46] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: syntax error
[23:29:49] <coldhead> ?eval jQuery.guid()
[23:29:50] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: jQuery.guid is not a function
[23:29:57] <coldhead> O RLY
[23:30:07] <systemfault> Hmm, surprised that jquery doesn't have something like that..
[23:30:32] <systemfault> I wonder how it does for .data then..
[23:30:45] <coldhead> it seems to have one
[23:30:53] <coldhead> but not for elems, for objects
[23:30:57] <coldhead> weirdo jquery
[23:31:57] <systemfault> hmm
[23:32:05] <systemfault> ?eval jQuery.uuid
[23:32:06] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[23:32:36] <coldhead> ?eval jQuery.fn.jquery

[23:32:42] <coldhead> oldsk00l
[23:33:00] <systemfault> Yeah, quite old :P
[23:34:10] <systemfault> jQuery.fn.expando
[23:34:15] <systemfault> ?eval jQuery.fn.expando
