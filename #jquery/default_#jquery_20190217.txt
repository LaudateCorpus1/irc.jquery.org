[01:02:01] <jak2000> hi all
[01:03:00] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[01:03:28] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!!!
[01:03:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:03:50] <jak2000> i need a advice..... i need create a multinivel menu i had this DB:
[01:04:08] <jak2000>  insert into menu (IdPadre, Descripcion) values (0, 'Menu Principal'), (1,'Menu Ppal 1'), (1,'Menu Ppal 2'), (1, 'Menu Ppal 3'), (3,'Menu X'), (5, 'Menu A');   (the first record is the root element.....)
[01:04:17] <robertmaxrees> uh ok?
[01:04:22] <jak2000> how to draw this? any advice or link for read?
[01:04:26] <robertmaxrees> uh
[01:04:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not really... digestible.
[01:04:51] <jak2000> wait
[01:04:57] <robertmaxrees> what's the JSON output?  make a fiddnel or something.
[01:05:03] <jak2000> ok
[01:05:03] <robertmaxrees> *jsfiddle
[01:14:44] <robertmaxrees> welp
[01:24:48] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you ok there?
[01:30:39] <jak2000> yes i am in
[01:30:42] <jak2000> creating the fiddle
[01:32:02] <robertmaxrees> It's taking you almost 30 minutes????
[01:32:05] <robertmaxrees> uh
[01:32:13] <robertmaxrees> fiddles should never take that long duder.
[01:34:11] <znf> I'm really confused about global variables
[01:34:20] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9aLzegb0/7/
[01:34:24] <znf> shouldn't var something = -- be a global?
[01:34:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:35:00] <jak2000> nothing by moment.... but i am interested if my Json its ok?
[01:35:17] <jak2000> and understand the menu?
[01:35:18] <robertmaxrees> znf var doesn't create global vars - they're still scoped.
[01:35:31] <znf> $.ajax({...}).success(function(data) { var l = data; }); <-- shouldn't 'l' be a global?
[01:35:32] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's not valid.
[01:35:36] <znf> ok, what does create global variables? :-/
[01:35:49] <robertmaxrees> znf why would you ever creake a global var??
[01:35:56] <jak2000> var jsonMenu = '{"0":"Menu Principal", "1":"Menu Ppal 1", "1":"Menu Ppal 2", "1":"Menu Ppal 3", "3":"Menu X", "5":"Menu A"}';
[01:36:00] <jak2000> is not ok?
[01:36:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's invalid.
[01:36:00] <znf> need some translations strings
[01:36:08] <robertmaxrees> znf make a fiddle.
[01:36:14] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you can't repeat property names.
[01:36:28] <robertmaxrees> make valid JSON.
[01:36:33] <jak2000> ok,
[01:37:47] <znf> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/3c10Lzgx/
[01:38:10] <robertmaxrees> znf why do you need a global var for that??
[01:38:47] <znf> it's just a bare example, I'll make use of it in other functions later on (hopefully)
[01:38:55] <robertmaxrees> that's... bad.
[01:38:57] <znf> and I don't really like the idea of passing it to all the functions all the itme
[01:38:59] <robertmaxrees> just use promises.
[01:39:04] <znf> I don't know how to do that
[01:39:09] <robertmaxrees> so then learn?
[01:39:19] <znf> totally not a coder
[01:39:24] <robertmaxrees> then become one?
[01:39:25] <znf> tried for 2 days to figure out how to use await
[01:39:39] <robertmaxrees> you totally don't need await.
[01:39:42] <znf> couldn't figure, so I'm just reverting to use .success()
[01:39:42] <robertmaxrees> just promises.
[01:39:45] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[01:39:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:39:51] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[01:39:54] <robertmaxrees> promises 101
[01:40:03] <znf> I do not know how to use promises, shit's too advanced for me
[01:40:09] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[01:40:18] <znf> I have no goals to become a coder, I just want to get this shit done and never touch it ever again
[01:40:29] <robertmaxrees> then find a coder to do it?
[01:40:36] <znf> we've been over this
[01:40:38] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:40:48] <robertmaxrees> good luck :3
[01:41:04] <robertmaxrees> i was gonna try and show you promises.  bummer!
[01:41:13] <znf> well, not like I haven't looked at it
[01:41:14] <znf> https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies
[01:41:24] <znf> this makes absolutely NO fucking sense to me
[01:42:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0pmh185/
[01:42:42] <znf> so rather than just trying to figure out shit I can't understand, I'd rather do it "low tech" with the crap I understand
[01:43:02] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the fiddle you just sent will never actually worl./
[01:43:04] <robertmaxrees> *work
[01:43:10] <robertmaxrees> so check out what I just sent you./
[01:43:10] <znf> why not?
[01:43:13] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[01:43:19] <robertmaxrees> race condiditons.
[01:43:21] <znf> god damn it, why does this damn thing have to be async
[01:43:28] <robertmaxrees> because it is.
[01:43:34] <robertmaxrees> ajax is... asynchronous.
[01:44:50] <robertmaxrees> part of the name, in fact :)
[01:45:45] <znf> I don't really understand why I can't just declare a global variable when I want to
[01:45:55] <robertmaxrees> because of race conditions./
[01:46:00] <robertmaxrees> and also: it's not valid.
[01:46:14] <robertmaxrees> just use Promises and save yourself the headaches.
[01:46:45] <znf> still don't know how to use it later on
[01:46:58] <robertmaxrees> okay look at my last fiddle ^
[01:47:06] <robertmaxrees> just save the ajax call itself.
[01:47:19] <robertmaxrees> and then any time you want to use the data, use .then()
[01:47:20] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9aLzegb0/17/   is valid json?
[01:47:33] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 nope.
[01:47:45] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you need a single root element.
[01:47:50] <robertmaxrees> *object
[01:47:54] <znf> I just want to use the damn translations in my fuctions later on, why do I have to use $(A'doaso'da [sjd).then
[01:48:00] <znf> I swear this makes no sense
[01:48:08] <robertmaxrees> znf because it's asynchronous.
[01:48:14] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on when the data will be there.
[01:48:21] <znf> fuck it, how do I call this crap in sync
[01:48:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[01:48:30] <robertmaxrees> you do it async.
[01:48:39] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you lock the end-user's browser.
[01:48:45] <znf> that's fine by me
[01:48:56] <robertmaxrees> it's not per your end users.
[01:48:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:49:04] <robertmaxrees> it's so so simple.
[01:49:08] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you how.
[01:49:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[01:49:38] <jak2000> the root is the first: in this case: {"id": 1,"level": 0,"description": "Menu Principal", "father": 0}
[01:49:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[01:49:47] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's not what i mean by "root"
[01:49:54] <robertmaxrees> wrap that in [] if you have to.
[01:50:33] <znf> like this? https://jsfiddle.net/0kp9edas/
[01:51:09] <robertmaxrees> !!! yessss
[01:51:14] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[01:51:39] <robertmaxrees> though i can simplify.  un momento.
[01:52:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6dmevs9b/1/
[01:52:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:54:27] <znf> that's just voodoo, you made it from 5 lines to ~12
[01:54:34] <znf> why is that simpler?
[01:54:47] <robertmaxrees> you only call $('#frmConfigureDomains') once.
[01:54:58] <robertmaxrees> also: thePromise.then(doConfigFormStuff);
[01:55:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:55:10] <robertmaxrees> a little boilerplate up ahead saves you time later.
[01:55:15] <znf> but you call it twice?
[01:55:22] <znf> first in $frmConfigureDomains
[01:55:26] <znf> then in the conditional?
[01:55:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6dmevs9b/3/
[01:55:51] <robertmaxrees> jeeze louise gimme a break ;)\
[01:55:51] <znf> surely you mean if ( $frmConfigureDomains.length > 0 ) { on line 7
[01:55:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:55:59] <robertmaxrees> alsdo
[01:56:02] <robertmaxrees> *also
[01:56:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6dmevs9b/5/
[01:56:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees you mean: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9aLzegb0/21/
[01:56:19] <znf> I'm just trying to figure it out, all this is voodoo to me, I don't know this wizardry
[01:56:22] <robertmaxrees> for jquery, the length is either 0 or greater than, and 0 is falsy so.
[01:56:28] <robertmaxrees> znf great time to learn then!
[01:57:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what do you think?
[01:57:06] <jak2000> yes like me.....
[01:57:09] <robertmaxrees> did you run it through a JSON validator?
[01:57:50] <jak2000> valid :)
[01:57:51] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 gotta learn those basic tools.
[01:57:57] <robertmaxrees> rad!
[01:57:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:58:06] <robertmaxrees> but, not a great format for what you want ;)
[01:58:17] <jak2000> understand my menu?
[01:58:21] <jak2000> wich recommend me?
[01:58:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:58:47] <znf> robertmaxrees, so what if I have 2 forms that I want to reuse that portion on?
[01:59:05] <robertmaxrees> i mean./
[01:59:15] <znf> ie: I will have a page where #frmConfigureDomains exists, and then another one where #frmRegister exists
[01:59:15] <robertmaxrees> znf you can't use an ID more than once soooo
[01:59:24] <robertmaxrees> why not use IDs?
[01:59:27] <robertmaxrees> err *classes.
[01:59:34] <znf> completely different forms
[01:59:39] <jak2000> more clear: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9aLzegb0/23/
[01:59:45] <robertmaxrees> without seeing how that tied into your ajax it's hard to help znf
[01:59:53] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 yeah that's weird.
[01:59:59] <znf> my ajax just returns all the translations that my CMS offers
[02:00:18] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait.
[02:00:24] <robertmaxrees> for internationalization?
[02:00:30] <znf> ...yes
[02:00:41] <robertmaxrees> why not use one of the dozens of ways of handling exactly that?
[02:01:06] <znf> I've no idea what other way to use, so I just resorted to my CMS outputing the whole array that holds the translations
[02:01:16] <znf> based on whatever the user has set as language
[02:01:19] <robertmaxrees> wait why are you doing this client-side?
[02:01:51] <znf> we've been over this!
[02:02:03] <robertmaxrees> lol i have multiple teams i work with dude.
[02:02:15] <robertmaxrees> you're on your own if you're gonna get into weird nonstandard setups.
[02:02:24] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 your data is still really weird.
[02:02:33] <znf> trying to not touch most of server-side stuff so we can do less work server-side between upgrades
[02:02:52] <znf> basically, our current situation is that we have in production a codebase that we haven't really touched in ~7 years or so
[02:03:04] <znf> because the guys who wrote it have been long time gone
[02:03:19] <robertmaxrees> oh wait are you the dudes who won't hire a programmer?
[02:03:22] <znf> we switched templates/themes for the whole CMS, and we don't want to edit them
[02:03:31] <znf> won/can
[02:03:36] <robertmaxrees> *won't.
[02:03:39] <znf> can't*
[02:03:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno what to tell you.
[02:03:45] <robertmaxrees> bummer :/
[02:03:56] <znf> when we tell them it's Smarty, they run for the hills
[02:04:20] <robertmaxrees> fwiw no engineer runs because of a technology choice :)
[02:04:29] <robertmaxrees> they run because of other reasons :D
[02:05:17] <znf> dunno what to tell you, "devs" we know prefer easy jobs that handle wordpress, I guess it's a matter of quantity over quality at this point
[02:05:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:05:41] <znf> easier to do 10 wordpress jobs for $x than one other-system job for $x * 10
[02:05:54] <robertmaxrees> that kind of attitude is working against you.  either way - if you wanna warn in your codebase, you're gonna have to learn how to code.
[02:06:01] <robertmaxrees> *warn = work
[02:06:08] <znf> it's not a popular CMS
[02:06:18] <robertmaxrees> OK?
[02:06:46] <znf> I mean, I get it. If someone would hire me to work with an obscure system that I'd have to learn from scratch, I'd probably also pass, rather than doing the jobs in the environment(s) I like and already know
[02:07:02] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[02:07:03] <znf> ie: I'm a linux sysadmin, I wouldn't really take a Windows Server job
[02:07:12] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[02:07:27] <robertmaxrees> all the engineers I've hired have never touched coldfusion and yet...
[02:07:32] <robertmaxrees> they still accepted our offer.
[02:08:16] <znf> well, probably depends on the pay...
[02:08:22] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[02:08:34] <robertmaxrees> too many companies undervalue softwware engineers.
[02:08:39] <znf> we don't need a developer all year around, he wouldn't really have anything to do, we're a small company
[02:09:28] <robertmaxrees> Okay?
[02:09:38] <robertmaxrees> Contractors deserve reasonable pay, too.
[02:09:58] <jak2000> znf, gve to robertmaxrees a contact by 6 months remotely....
[02:09:59] <znf> sure, it's a matter of actually finding one that would work for less than what we make in a year for a few months :P
[02:10:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:10:43] <jak2000> *gave
[02:11:20] <robertmaxrees> znf sounds like you have some unrealistic expectations :/
[02:11:51] <robertmaxrees> you're in a crappy spot.  you'll either need to learn how to code or pony of the cash for an engineer.
[02:11:57] <znf> we just have had bad experience, or, rather, my coworker/boss had some
[02:12:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:12:18] <znf> before I started working with him, he told me he had a guy work on a new codebase, for about a year
[02:12:18] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[02:12:22] <znf> they never really finished it
[02:12:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he's never actually done his due diligence and gotten advice on the subject.
[02:13:21] <znf> because $dev didn't have experience with the platform and business area, so the boss had to guide him trough all the bits of the projects, but because he also had other stuff to do... it was going slow
[02:13:33] <znf> I understand the issue, I'm just having hard time to explain it
[02:13:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:15:33] <znf> but, to put it in perspective, with much less coding experience, and just because I know the business area and how stuff is supposed to work, we've done more in ~1 month than the previous guy in one year
[02:15:37] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, either way.  sounds like one of you need to work on taking some engineering lessons :)
[02:16:04] <znf> What we're doing now is just polishing some bits, hoping to put this in production next month
[02:16:15] <jak2000> robertmaxreeshow to create a <li> menu element? based on this JSon: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9aLzegb0/23/
[02:16:35] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that data is still weird.  what's the point of the ID?
[02:16:56] <robertmaxrees> and how do you think you'd do it?
[02:17:12] <znf> what I mean, stuff works in the backend properly, at least 99% of it, anyway (we're still going to have to do some bits and pieces with the live data, migrating some customer data from one type to another, whatever), but right now we're missing form validation and some translations don't work properly :P
[02:17:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) okie
[02:17:59] <robertmaxrees> znf the issue you're going to keep running into is that you outright reject advice given here.
[02:18:12] <Woet> jak2000: unless you're paying robertmaxrees, please make some attempts yourself before asking.
[02:18:13] <jak2000> ID attribute is a auto_increment, this ID is used for know the childs....
[02:18:22] <Woet> jak2000: and share the code if you run into issues.
[02:18:33] <jak2000> Woet thanks :) and okay
[02:18:37] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 ^^^^ you're not even trying at this point.
[02:18:41] <znf> That's not my intent. It's just that javascript has advanced so much in the last years that I've been completely out of the loop with promises and whatever...
[02:18:47] <Woet> jak2000: not the first time I've reminded you of this
[02:18:50] <Woet> jak2000: probably around the 4th or 5th time
[02:18:53] <znf> I wasn't even aware of "promises" ~6 months ago
[02:18:58] <robertmaxrees> znf it's not even that.
[02:19:10] <robertmaxrees> znf what you're trying to handle (async) has been apart of JS for years.
[02:19:12] <jak2000> Woet, ok
[02:19:48] <znf> My experience with javascript is mostly just writing userscripts or tweaking data when I need it
[02:20:04] <robertmaxrees> znf none of what you're saying is going to change my advice.
[02:20:30] <znf> that's not my intention :)
[02:20:38] <robertmaxrees> 'k.
[02:20:44] <robertmaxrees> so learn to code? :)
[02:20:57] <znf> I still appreciate your advice, even tough I'm just reticent on understanding it because it's new and outside of my expertise
[02:21:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a great reason to learn how to code! :)
[02:23:47] <jak2000> friends return in 6 hours, not think clearly, i want sleep, thanks

[03:13:25] <poyha> im trying to add a header based on regions with jquery can someone help me with this one https://jsfiddle.net/j5akd04m/1/
[03:15:57] <Woet> poyha: what is your question?
[03:16:34] <poyha> Woet: i dont know how to descibe it thats why i made a example on my fiddle
[03:16:53] <Woet> poyha: there are no errors on the fiddle.
[03:17:07] <Woet> poyha: hence, what is your question?
[03:17:46] <poyha> Woet: look a the output says WANT TO GET THIS thats what i want to get with jquery
[03:17:53] <Woet> poyha: go ahead.
[03:18:59] <poyha> Woet: ?
[03:19:19] <Woet> poyha: you're not asking any questions
[03:19:22] <Woet> poyha: you're saying what you want
[03:21:49] <poyha> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/j5akd04m/2/ look at the right example
[03:22:03] <Woet> poyha: cool
[03:22:10] <poyha> Woet:  ?
[03:22:17] <Woet> poyha: for the fourth time now, what is your question?
[03:22:58] <poyha> Woet: hm the left list is made by jquery, i want the same list as the right list on the left side
[03:23:09] <Woet> poyha: go ahead.
[03:23:18] <poyha> Woet: ?
[03:23:35] <Woet> poyha: you seem to be confusing this channel with a contractor
[03:23:45] <Woet> poyha: we don't write your code.
[03:23:50] <Woet> poyha: we help you learn jQuery.
[03:23:51] <poyha> Woet: nah, i just want to know how to do this
[03:24:03] <Woet> poyha: okay, then make an attempt and ask us if you run into issues.
[03:24:10] <Woet> poyha: because so far you haven't made any attempts
[03:24:28] <poyha> Woet: uhu i dont know how to describe it but nevermind
[03:25:01] <Woet> poyha: like, the output you want has no obvious link to the regions.
[03:25:11] <Woet> poyha: 2 "THERE" suddenly turns into 4
[03:25:41] <poyha> Woet: oops i meant like this https://jsfiddle.net/j5akd04m/3/
[03:25:42] <Woet> poyha: it's a flat single level array with 5 objects
[03:25:53] <Woet> poyha: that's the same.
[03:25:58] <Woet> ok, no, it's not
[03:26:02] <Woet> now 2 "THERE" turned into 3
[03:26:07] <Woet> and 3 here turned into 4
[03:26:09] <Woet> with one in capitals
[03:26:48] <poyha> Woet: yes i want to add .headers for every region in this case "here" and "there"
[03:27:15] <Woet> poyha: I honestly think it requires actual effort to be this vague.
[03:28:47] <Woet> poyha: there are no indicators in your array that randomly turn it into "regions"
[03:28:48] <Woet> poyha: perhaps use actual data that makes sense to get your point across.
[03:30:51] <poyha> Woet: does this make sense https://jsfiddle.net/j5akd04m/4/
[03:31:44] <Woet> poyha: so store the previous region name in a variable and if the current one doesn't match, add your header class.
