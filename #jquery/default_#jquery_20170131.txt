[03:06:07] <DreamStiffling> Hello everyone
[03:06:12] <DreamStiffling> Happy Chinese New Year
[03:06:16] <DreamStiffling> Cuckoo co coooo
[03:09:35] <DreamStiffling> ok im using templating script (vm) and used substring on a field. For texts that are more than 100 will be reduced to 97 and added ... (elypsis) at the end. The problem i am having is, the text consists of html tags. And at times the script will remove the closing html tags. So, i am looking of a way via jQuery to read this string (after it has been generated)  and add closing tags to those that are missing. Any ideas?
[03:12:18] <DreamStiffling> well spank me and call me daddy
[03:47:42] <Lebbe> the browser will close all tags for you
[03:48:51] <Lebbe> it is near impossible, after the browser have rendered the HTML code, to know where the closing tag "should have been" for the individual cases
[03:51:10] <DreamStiffling> Lebbe: youre the magician..im the apprentice..or shall i say padawan
[03:54:54] <Cork> DreamStiffling: an option would be to make the truncating script a bit more complex and only touch the text nodes in the source
[03:55:22] <Cork> and leave all the html tags intact (possbly run a cleanup sweep afterwards and remove empty elements)
[03:55:41] <Cork> that way you would never generate invalid html
[03:56:20] <Cork> it would mean you would have to generate the ending html and parse that into dom before truncating though
[03:58:11] <Cork> alternatively you could just parse the html into dom and back to html and have the error correction fix up the result automatically
[03:59:08] <Lebbe> from/with the templating system? clever idea
[03:59:14] <DreamStiffling> Cork: what do you mean by error correction oh wise master
[03:59:27] <DreamStiffling> the auto closing tags?
[04:00:00] <Lebbe> turn the blob of text into dom or virtual dom, and then back to text
[04:00:21] <Lebbe> that would close all non-closed tags etc locally to the text-blob you are substringing
[04:00:52] <Lebbe> is this substringing happening in the browser, btw?
[04:01:33] <DreamStiffling> Lebbe: nope..server side
[04:02:06] <DreamStiffling> thats why i was thinking i could jquery it and find unclosed tags, and close it.
[04:02:08] <Cork> DreamStiffling: https://jsfiddle.net/8e7675up/
[04:02:36] <Cork> DreamStiffling: it would have to be ran AFTER running the template engine though
[04:02:42] <Cork> you can't run it on the template
[04:04:15] <DreamStiffling> Cork: if i understood this correctly it might work. itll take me a while to implement it. thank you masters
[04:04:24] <DreamStiffling> will get back on the result
[04:04:47] <Cork> DreamStiffling: also there is possible a third choice
[04:04:54] <Cork> don't truncate at all :)
[04:05:00] <Cork> hide it through css
[04:05:21] <DreamStiffling> Cork: that did come across my mind
[04:05:35] <DreamStiffling> Cork: truncate using jquery instead..
[04:05:49] <Cork> uh
[04:05:54] <Cork> that is not what i meant
[04:06:11] <DreamStiffling> ok what do you mean
[04:06:41] <Cork> if the text is meant to be single liners (no line wrap) you can use css eclipse
[04:07:14] <Cork> if it is multi line you can set a max height on the element and use :after to illustrate that it is truncated
[04:07:43] <Cork> that way you can provide an option for the user to show the content if they want without much code at all (you need to set a class to set height to auto)
[04:08:09] <Cork> opps max-height not height
[04:08:33] <DreamStiffling> "...use css eclipse.." elipsys u mean?
[04:08:35] <len__> @DreamStiffling: How to add whatzapp share button for websites, i'm using addthis plugins but not shows in uc browser in mobile devices?
[04:08:57] <DreamStiffling> why are you asking me @len__
[04:08:57] <len__> any ideas?
[04:09:07] <Cork> elilipsis
[04:09:07] <DreamStiffling> no idea
[04:09:10] <Cork> DreamStiffling: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow#Values
[04:09:23] <len__> i thought u could help
[04:10:00] <Cork> sigh... typo day to day i see -_-'
[04:10:14] <Cork> well i switched keyboard yesterday so i blame that :P
[04:10:51] <len__> How to add whatzapp share button for websites, i'm using addthis plugins but not shows in uc browser in mobile devices?
[04:11:22] <Cork> len__: check there documentation it is most likely listed there
[04:11:48] <Cork> (i would be very very surprised it wasn't)
[04:11:57] <DreamStiffling> Cork: just testing out http://plugins.jquery.com/ellipsis/ wouldnt this be good? since i do need couple of lines before the elipsis. still looking at yer css solution though
[04:12:27] <Cork> DreamStiffling: except it does it in js, so it doesn't give you any of the advantages i talked about before
[04:14:18] <DreamStiffling> ok trying to understand the :after part
[04:14:19] <DreamStiffling> thank
[04:14:21] <DreamStiffling> you
[04:14:36] <Cork> DreamStiffling: it is quite simple
[04:14:48] <Cork> wrap the elements in an element (ex a div) you control
[04:15:06] <Cork> set a max-height: 4rem; or something like that
[04:15:33] <Cork> and an :after with a background: linear-gradient (for example)
[04:15:44] <Cork> and set the :after to be positioned at the bottom of the element
[04:15:50] <Cork> and set overflow: hidden;
[04:16:02] <Cork> and yuu get automatic truncation
[04:16:36] <Cork> you will have to fiddle with the 4rem a bit to get it match the font size, but that should be about it
[04:19:21] <Lebbe> cork: you cant use ellipsis with several lines of text
[04:19:34] <Lebbe> text-overflow has to be combined with white-space: nowrap
[04:19:39] <Cork> that is exactly what i said a while ago...
[04:19:44] <Lebbe> oooh
[04:19:52] <Cork> i gave two options
[04:19:58] <DreamStiffling> calm down snail here
[04:19:59] <Lebbe> yeah so you use :after for ellipsis
[04:20:02] <Lebbe> i c
[04:20:03] <Duikb00t> hola
[04:20:12] <Cork> Lebbe: if it is multi line ya
[04:20:15] <Lebbe> buuut, what if the text doesnt overflows?
[04:20:36] <Cork> then the gradient will just melt into the background
[04:20:44] <Cork> (white on white)
[04:20:51] <Lebbe> mmmm
[04:21:01] <Duikb00t> I am trying to clone a div based on a 'checkbox' if the checkbox is checked the div should be cloned and shown for that  'checkbox' so if I check more then 1 checkbox I would see multiple clones of the element. I think I am almost there...
[04:21:13] <Duikb00t> so far I have this: https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/12/
[04:21:13] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/12/
[04:22:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: you need to check this.checked
[04:22:26] <Cork> also you need to way to identify if the element so you can remove it when the checkbox is removed
[04:23:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: also $('input[type="checkbox"]').on('change', function(e) { => $('.container').on('change', ':checkbox', function(e) {
[04:24:18] <DreamStiffling> Cork: Lebbe : https://jsfiddle.net/3s4n1ccp/1/
[04:24:43] <DreamStiffling> looking to put after at p or which
[04:25:14] <Cork> DreamStiffling: what is the question?
[04:25:40] <DreamStiffling> hold on let me fiddle again
[04:27:45] <Duikb00t> Cork:  so far: ' https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/14/ '
[04:28:06] <Duikb00t> I've added your changes :P
[04:28:31] <Cork> Duikb00t: just do this.checked
[04:28:47] <Cork> no need to wrap this in jquery make a query for :checked
[04:28:53] <Cork> only to check if a property on this is true
[04:29:22] <Duikb00t> ;
[04:29:23] <Duikb00t> So this way: https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/15/
[04:29:34] <Cork> yup
[04:30:29] <Duikb00t> But can I limit the clone to just 1 time for every element?
[04:30:50] <Duikb00t> or do I have to remove on 'un-check' first?
[04:30:53] <Cork> i guess you could use the data-name as a selector to remove the old copy when the checkbox is unchecked
[04:31:08] <Cork> well either that or disable the checkbox when it gets checked
[04:32:07] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/18/  like this? ( the delete method )
[04:32:44] <Cork> oh...
[04:33:01] <Cork> Duikb00t: you want to move the attr('data-name') to modify the clone not the original
[04:33:13] <Cork> else things will be messy in the remove function
[04:33:56] <Duikb00t> 1 second I hope i understand it right
[04:35:53] <Duikb00t> something like this https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/19/
[04:36:17] <Duikb00t> Now with use of name, https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/20/
[04:36:31] <Cork> ya, except you will have to fix generateNewDetailLine
[04:36:40] <Cork> or it will break the script as it will remove the original
[04:36:52] <Cork> as you set data-name on the original before you clone it
[04:37:08] <Cork> (you should set it on the clone, not the original)
[04:37:13] <Duikb00t> hmm
[04:37:16] <Duikb00t> Im confused a bit about that
[04:37:30] <Duikb00t> I am 'searching' for the cloned one by doing  the attr data-name... stuf no?
[04:37:45] <Cork> $details.clone().attr().insertAfter().show()
[04:37:55] <Cork> not $details.attr().clone().insertAfter().show()
[04:38:37] <Duikb00t> :(
[04:38:46] <Duikb00t> And then there was nothing :D
[04:42:00] <Duikb00t> bah
[04:44:00] <hellyeah> yo
[04:44:28] <Duikb00t> Cork:  that's negative
[04:44:32] <Duikb00t> hey hellyeah
[04:45:05] <Duikb00t> don't I have to say in the attr which one?
[04:45:07] <Duikb00t> data-name?
[04:45:22] <Cork> Duikb00t: the line i gave you was psudo code
[04:45:32] <Cork> it was the structure not the content
[04:46:27] <Duikb00t> Cork:  https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/21/
[04:46:55] <Cork> Duikb00t: try thinking about what i said again
[04:47:04] <Cork> and read through your own function
[04:47:34] <Duikb00t> The cloned element
[04:53:55] <Duikb00t> meh
[04:53:56] <Duikb00t> no
[04:54:21] <Cork> ...
[04:54:21] <printForever> I have a strange issue. Console.Log is not writing anything to the Console. Also, .on('click')... alert() fires twice!
[04:54:26] <Cork> Duikb00t: line 17...
[04:54:52] <printForever> Console.Log should always write if the condition is met
[04:55:04] <printForever> its not jQuery related?
[04:55:04] <Cork> not if something wrote over window.console
[04:55:09] <printForever> oh...
[04:55:19] <printForever> so I should use window.console.log?
[04:55:33] <Cork> it is fairly common for production environments to define window.console = { log: function() {} }
[04:55:46] <Cork> no you should check if that is the cause
[04:55:52] <Duikb00t> Cork:  Feels like I can remove that line because on 18 im doing the same?
[04:56:21] <Cork> ... it means you should remove that line, cause it makes the change we did don't do anything
[04:56:28] <Cork> as you still add it on the wrong element
[04:56:28] <Duikb00t> I removed it yes
[04:56:52] <printForever> I've used window.console.log - nothing
[04:57:02] <Cork> (my point is you should try to figure out what you're trying to do, if you do you would realize that)
[04:57:07] <Cork> ...
[04:57:18] <Cork> printForever: that isn't at all what i meant with that line
[04:57:21] <printForever> I just want console.log to write "hello"
[04:57:34] <printForever> but for some reason its not working
[04:57:35] <Cork> window.console.log is the same thing as console.log, window is the global scope
[04:57:39] <printForever> alert('hello') is working
[04:57:49] <Cork> if something run window.console = { log: function() {} } in the browser it kills the access to console.log
[04:57:59] <printForever> ohhhhhh
[04:58:00] <Duikb00t> I am thinking I am cloning '$details' but Im still working on the original one, thaths the issue imo?
[04:58:01] <Cork> you will have to check if that is done in the site you're working with
[04:58:09] <printForever> ok
[04:58:13] <printForever> second thing!
[04:58:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: you modify the original BEFORE cloning it
[04:58:36] <Cork> meaning the original will be changed
[04:58:38] <printForever> Why is alert going off 2x each click?
[04:58:41] <Duikb00t> indeed
[04:58:47] <Duikb00t> $details.clone().attr('data-name', e.target.value).insertAfter($details).show()  but here
[04:58:49] <Cork> printForever: cause you bind the event twice
[04:58:49] <Duikb00t> I say clone first
[04:58:55] <Cork> yes
[04:59:00] <Cork> that was the point of that change
[04:59:02] <Duikb00t> ok
[04:59:04] <printForever> $('#myidoptions label').on('click', function() {... and it goes off twice
[04:59:06] <Duikb00t> But still it modifys both
[04:59:15] <printForever> Cork: I haven't bind it...
[04:59:29] <Duikb00t> oh lol
[04:59:30] <Cork> Duikb00t: cause you run the previous line first
[04:59:30] <Duikb00t> I see
[05:00:09] <printForever> Cork?
[05:00:30] <printForever> how its pre-binded?
[05:00:34] <printForever> I dont get it
[05:00:55] <Cork> printForever: it isn't predinging
[05:01:03] <Cork> for example, the line runs twice for some reason
[05:01:11] <Cork> but i can't say why without the causing context
[05:01:42] <printForever> its 3 radio buttons wrapped in label, I want to get on label click
[05:01:56] <Cork> printForever: try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[05:02:04] <printForever> ok
[05:02:07] <Duikb00t> ok
[05:02:22] <Duikb00t> So to work on the clone I have to work ith $(this)
[05:02:32] <Duikb00t> In my generateNewDetailLine method right?
[05:02:45] <Cork> no
[05:02:53] <Cork> this has nothing to do with the clone
[05:03:09] <Cork> you will have to find it by searching the siblings of $details
[05:03:55] <Cork> something like $details.nextAll('[data-name=' + name + ']')
[05:07:32] <printForever> I'm unable to recreate the issue
[05:07:48] <Duikb00t> rofl
[05:08:52] <Duikb00t> so far https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/25/
[05:09:59] <Duikb00t> so I can better make $elm for that nextAll(); and then change text etc etc
[05:11:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/26/
[05:11:17] <printForever> Cork, how can I investigate console.log problem?
[05:11:28] <printForever> Search the project?
[05:11:34] <Cork> ya
[05:11:52] <Cork> you could do something like console.log.toSource() if the browser supports it
[05:12:04] <printForever> hmmm
[05:12:12] <printForever> so I should search for console.log :(
[05:12:20] <Cork> no
[05:12:26] <Cork> you could search for console
[05:12:48] <Cork> cause console = {} would break it
[05:12:52] <printForever> how?
[05:13:06] <Cork> i already answered that...
[05:13:21] <printForever> console = {} broke it
[05:13:31] <printForever> how do I reinit?
[05:13:31] <Cork> no...
[05:13:37] <printForever> :(
[05:13:40] <printForever> I haz the dumbs today
[05:13:42] <Cork> "<Cork> if something run window.console = { log: function() {} } in the browser it kills the access to console.log"
[05:13:43] <Duikb00t> hmmm
[05:13:49] <printForever> oh
[05:13:59] <Cork> so anything setting a global variable console will break the debug functionality
[05:14:00] <Duikb00t> Thanks for but not 100% understanded yet.
[05:14:15] <Duikb00t> Im thinking about how can I just make for example text changes on the h4 on the cloned element?
[05:14:30] <Cork> Duikb00t: change based on what?
[05:14:47] <Cork> you have checkboxes so multiple can be checked at a time
[05:15:20] <Duikb00t> Yes correct But I would like to make the h4 in the 'detials' to be the value of the checkbox
[05:15:37] <Cork> uh doesn't it already do that >_>
[05:15:55] <Cork> ah, no it doesn't...
[05:16:00] <Duikb00t> <_< Not yet ;p
[05:16:43] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/z1of30zm/27/
[05:17:16] <Duikb00t> omg
[05:17:25] <Duikb00t> Ok thanks I see now what I was doing wrong.
[05:17:36] <Duikb00t> I did the same a minute ago but on the wrong 'line'
[05:17:53] <Duikb00t> >< I was doing it before the insertAfter ><
[05:18:05] <Cork> ya, so you inserted the h4 not the clone
[05:18:13] <Cork> well not the entire clone
[05:19:55] <Duikb00t> ok
[05:20:06] <newer> Hello, I have got this div that I am trying to retrieve with a simple jQuery id selector:
[05:20:10] <newer> <div data-ref="incident.comments" style="display: none;" id="element.incident.comments" data-type="journal_input" data-in-stream="true" class="form-group ">
[05:20:13] <newer> but it returns nothing
[05:20:16] <newer> jQuery("#element.incident.comments")
[05:20:20] <newer> Any help please?
[05:20:24] <Cork> newer: make a jsfiddle.net
[05:21:30] <newer> Cork: I have never done it, but I guess its somethin like this? https://jsfiddle.net/pmg7s77t/
[05:21:32] <newer> many thanks
[05:21:54] <Cork> well as long as i get the js and html i'm fine in this case, so ya
[05:21:59] <Duikb00t> thanks for your assitance, patience, but Cork I understand now what it does.
[05:22:03] <Cork> (reading that in irc sucks)
[05:22:20] <printForever> Cork, there isn't anything that is killing console.log
[05:22:28] <Cork> newer: and you want the element matching the selector?
[05:22:40] <printForever> also, there are other parts of the code/project that use console.log and it works fine
[05:22:41] <printForever> o.O
[05:23:02] <Cork> newer: characters that has meaning in css needs to be escaped in ids
[05:23:06] <newer> Cork: I want to get that div with jQuery
[05:23:11] <Cork> so jQuery("#element\\.incident\\.comments")
[05:23:38] <Cork> alternatively, don't use dot, space, colon, and [] in your ids
[05:23:50] <Cork> and things will be a lot easier
[05:24:14] <Cork> personally i would change id="element.incident.comments" to id="element_incident_comments"
[05:24:15] <newer> Cork: oh, many thanks :)
[05:25:03] <Cork> printForever: it might be firing fake events or something like that
[05:25:13] <Cork> causing the event to happen multiple times
[05:26:02] <Cork> printForever: oh, also remember that clicking an input field connected to a label fires the event on the label too
[05:26:17] <Cork> that might be what is happening for you (can't tell as you never showed any code)
[05:30:01] <printForever> Cork, I've figured out that for the label. :D
[05:30:24] <printForever> but I still can't wrap my head around console.log not firing
[05:31:44] <printForever> console.log('hello') returns undefined
[05:31:45] <printForever> WTF
[05:32:02] <Cork> that is normal
[05:32:08] <Cork> console.log is what you want to check
[05:32:41] <printForever> hm...
[05:32:55] <printForever> console.log returns log()
[05:34:30] <theCole> have a link to your source ?
[05:39:19] <newer> Cork: sorry to bother you again, what about retrieving this class? "comment-box container-fluid"
[05:39:42] <Cork> newer: retrieving or matching?
[05:39:54] <newer> Cork: matching I guess :)
[05:39:57] <Cork> newer: the jquery selector is just normal css selectors
[05:40:07] <newer> I tried this: jQuery(".comment-box container-fluid")
[05:40:09] <Cork> it follows the exact same matching rules
[05:40:23] <Cork> newer: chain the classes together with dots
[05:40:31] <Cork> you have two classes there
[05:41:12] <newer> Cork: jQuery(".comment-box.container-fluid") does not seem to work
[05:41:22] <Cork> it should
[05:41:45] <newer> Cork: yep, iframe problem, thanks :)
[05:47:24] <newer> last one, is it possible to remove a property within an attr? I want to remove the 'display' within the 'css' attribute
[05:47:33] <newer> I know I can do: .removeAttr('style')
[05:48:01] <newer> can I do something like: .removeAttr('css.display')?
[05:48:38] <xec> no, not without some regex i reckon. you can set the display to something else with .css() though
[05:48:58] <newer> xec: yes, but it does not look like if I remove it...
[05:49:24] <xec> newer: well, what value does display get if you remove it from the attribute?
[05:49:33] <Cork> well actually
[05:49:43] <Cork> .css('display', '') will remove it from the inline css
[05:50:04] <Cork> and use the default display style instead

[06:07:40] <rooty_> guys i have a json object getting loaded in via ajax, but i want the list to be revered.. its not an array so i can't use reverse.. best way to approach this?
[06:10:31] <DreamStiffling> faILED MISERABLY
[06:10:38] <DreamStiffling> sorry caps
[06:10:51] <DreamStiffling> found a solution but loads heavy
[06:11:00] <DreamStiffling> be back tmrw
[06:11:06] <DreamStiffling> thx again
[06:12:38] <Cork> rooty_: you can't revert an object
[06:12:53] <rooty_> yes i know, so what can I do instead Cork
[06:13:18] <Cork> simplest is prob to change how you use the objects instead
[06:13:38] <Cork> for example Object.keys(obj) will give you the keys
[06:13:48] <Cork> you can just run through that array backwards
[06:14:06] <Cork> anyway afk

[11:49:16] <dhecar> Hi, is this http://pastebin.com/kms26Mxa the correct way to show/hide div ? Thanks,
[12:23:04] <backnforth> Hi, does anyone here know how I can get tooltip.js installed
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> backnforth usually just need to include a link to the js file on the page.
[12:23:33] <robertmaxrees> using a script tag.
[12:23:53] <backnforth> I'm not sure where to get tooltip.js tho
[12:24:02] <robertmaxrees> which tooltip.js are you looking at?
[12:24:10] <backnforth> Any
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:24:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta pick one first.
[12:24:26] <robertmaxrees> you using bootstrap or jqui or anything like that?
[12:24:30] <backnforth> I get an error from popover.js that I'm missing tooltip.js
[12:24:34] <backnforth> both
[12:24:37] <robertmaxrees> where'd you get popover.js?
[12:24:45] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of generic heh
[12:24:53] <backnforth> I think bootstrap
[12:25:11] <backnforth> because I get an error saying: Boostrap tooltips require Tether
[12:25:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you did a partial install of bootstrap features.
[12:25:31] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're including all the JS for it.
[12:25:46] <backnforth> There was only 1 js
[12:25:50] <backnforth> bootstrap.min.js
[12:26:20] <backnforth> I'm running bootsrap alpha, perhaps thats why
[12:26:25] <robertmaxrees> getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips "
[12:26:25] <robertmaxrees> Popovers require the tooltip plugin to be included in your version of Bootstrap.
[12:26:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have an out of date version or you're missing some things.
[12:27:05] <robertmaxrees> double-check to make sure you have a complete copy of bootstrap.
[12:28:24] <backnforth> I downloaded it via a .zip file and the zip file finished downloading, so I have all of bootstrap
[12:28:30] <backnforth> btw, I appreciate the help robertmaxrees
[12:29:05] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're being a little vague - WHAT zip file?  did you make sure you referenced all the JS files you need?
[12:29:32] <backnforth> Zip file as in the zipfile provided by the bootstrap website
[12:29:37] <backnforth> And yes I did
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> and you included everything in the right order?
[12:30:00] <backnforth> Not sure
[12:30:02] <robertmaxrees> no 404's?
[12:30:08] <backnforth> I'm following an example from a website
[12:30:11] <backnforth> No 404s
[12:30:19] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.  i'd have to see it.
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> but generally you include jquery, bootstrap, and any plugins.
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> in roughly that order.
[12:31:26] <backnforth> I'm merely trying to install the following calendar: https://github.com/Paul-DS/bootstrap-year-calendar
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> still gotta meet all of its requirements.
[12:32:44] <backnforth> http://www.bootstrap-year-calendar.com/#Download There's a typescript file but I'm not sure if that's optional or not
[12:33:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't use that.
[12:33:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not JS.
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> so one js file and one css file.
[12:33:49] <robertmaxrees> pretty cut and dry.
[13:07:29] <PersianMG> Howdy, I have a little problem with this sniplet https://jsfiddle.net/8wbxc2a3/, it seems like links don't seem to work as the inner span changes constantly? How do I fix this?
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> do do you mean by "don't seem to work"?
[13:08:48] <PersianMG> Clicking on the link does not redirect you (unless if you 'spam' it a few times before it updates again)
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[13:09:11] <PersianMG> Chrome
[13:09:19] <robertmaxrees> hah.  ff worked fine.
[13:09:20] <MikeD_> that's a neat bit of nonsense
[13:09:29] <MikeD_> my ff didn't
[13:09:38] <MikeD_> 50.1.0
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> 53.0a2
[13:10:07] <robertmaxrees> dev edition.
[13:10:12] <MikeD_> i just noticed an update pending, so i'm restarting it now
[13:10:38] <MikeD_> now 51.0.1 - same
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> PersianMG where'd you get this from?
[13:10:48] <PersianMG> I have same issue: 54.0a1 nightly
[13:11:04] <robertmaxrees> wonder why it worked fine for me.
[13:11:06] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:11:17] <PersianMG> Maybe you timed it right?
[13:11:32] <PersianMG> If you click before the update interval it works (thats why spam clicking works)
[13:11:34] <robertmaxrees> seemed pretty consistent.  either way - bug's there in chrome for me.
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> where'd you get the script from?
[13:11:46] <PersianMG> I'm just confused why its behaving like this?
[13:12:49] <PersianMG> From a git repo, trying to find it now
[13:13:08] <robertmaxrees> probably an issue with the way it handles renderd.
[13:13:15] <robertmaxrees> *renders
[13:13:20] <PersianMG> https://github.com/xoxco/rainbow-text
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/xoxco/Rainbow-Text/issues/8
[13:14:11] <robertmaxrees> looks semi-related.
[13:15:32] <shbst> hey guys, I have a question.  If i query $.click on a class of objects, how many event listeners am I creating?  1 or 1 per object that was selected?
[13:15:50] <MikeD_> many : use delegation
[13:16:10] <MikeD_> i meant "many; use delegation instead"
[13:16:10] <robertmaxrees> shbst one for each element selection via $()
[13:16:17] <backnforth> Hi, does anyone here know why I'm getting an error from bootstrap-popover.js saying that this.init is not a function ?
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> backnforth sounds like you're including things in the wrong order.
[13:16:36] <shbst> MikeD_ thanks.  robertmaxrees also thanks
[13:16:52] <backnforth> What order should I have?
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> already said earlier :) jquery, bootstrap, any extra plugins after.
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> also: try ##bootstrap.
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> backnforth also make sure you're not trying to use things before you include them.
[13:20:48] <backnforth> These aren't problems robertmaxrees
[13:20:59] <backnforth> I have tried as suggested but still the same error
[13:21:02] <robertmaxrees> backnforth (shrug) without seeing the page it's hard to help and validate.
[13:21:11] <backnforth> I can provide you the source?
[13:21:14] <backnforth> It's not very much
[13:21:23] <backnforth> Perhaps just the .html
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> bpaste or something.
[13:21:56] <backnforth> bpaste?
[13:22:05] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> really just anything but pastebin hahaha
[13:22:35] <backnforth> https://bpaste.net/show/0aa1dd8e81ea
[13:22:48] <robertmaxrees> missing a doctype btw.
[13:23:20] <backnforth> same error
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> still a good thing to fix.
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle that shows the problem?
[13:24:19] <backnforth> not sure how
[13:24:21] <backnforth> sorry
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> see "external resources" on the left?
[13:24:53] <robertmaxrees> include a link to each script there.
[13:25:04] <robertmaxrees> then html, see, and js as needed.
[13:25:47] <robertmaxrees> *css haha
[13:25:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, it's really really hard to help you./
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it's obvious the issue lies within your various script tags.
[13:28:31] <backnforth> how do I share?
[13:28:37] <backnforth> https://jsfiddle.net/do1e5j6p/
[13:28:38] <backnforth> Got it
[13:29:00] <backnforth> how to include external js?
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[13:29:04] <backnforth> latest stable
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> so 3.1.1?
[13:29:20] <robertmaxrees> and... external resources is how you do that.
[13:29:45] <backnforth> yes, 3.1.1
[13:29:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/do1e5j6p/1/ doesn't have the error.
[13:30:39] <YokoBR> hi folks
[13:30:57] <backnforth> that doesn't even show any calendars
[13:30:58] <YokoBR> how do i change the box shadow opacity of an element with jquery?
[13:31:35] <robertmaxrees> .css()
[13:31:56] <backnforth> ah
[13:32:06] <YokoBR> yep, but what would come inside of .css()?
[13:32:31] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR the same as any other property you're editing.
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> .css('propertyname', 'newvalue')
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can't just edit the opacity alone - gotta update the whole thing.
[13:33:04] <robertmaxrees> could have that wrong tho.
[13:33:22] <backnforth> robertmaxrees: could I send a tar of everything
[13:33:34] <backnforth> Would you take a tar file?
[13:33:45] <robertmaxrees> backnforth normally i'd say no but sure - mind using zip or rar instead?
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> and posting the link into the channel?
[13:34:27] <backnforth> zip is fine
[13:34:30] <backnforth> sure
[13:35:01] <backnforth> wish I had some kind of entity for some kind of proof of integrity, but yeah
[13:35:52] <backnforth> How do I link it?
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> upload it somewhere.
[13:36:05] <robertmaxrees> drop link here.
[13:36:06] <robertmaxrees> done.
[13:36:22] <backnforth> k, I'll use github
[13:38:28] <backnforth> https://github.com/AlexCreamer/bootstrap-calendar
[13:38:54] <Horacsio> hi I have this "Orders (Page 1)" text and I want to style it via CSS after character 6. how to?
[13:39:02] <robertmaxrees> backnforth uh
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> that's only 164 bytes.
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> no contents
[13:39:24] <backnforth> oops, sorry
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio what's after character 6?
[13:39:30] <backnforth> Need to figure out how to zip
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> yopu mean then (Page 1)?
[13:39:38] <Horacsio> (Page 1)
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> have your backend output it into a span and style it.
[13:40:09] <Horacsio> the thing is that (Page 1) becomes 2, 3, 4,...
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my advice.
[13:40:27] <robertmaxrees> your backend can output that with a span.
[13:40:56] <backnforth> Fixed
[13:41:02] <Horacsio> I have this <div class="orders">Orders (page 1)</div>
[13:41:05] <backnforth> Should work fine now
[13:41:22] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio so then have your backend output it correctly.
[13:41:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you keep ignoring that advice.
[13:41:55] <Horacsio> because I can't do the way you told. tried that already.
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> why can't you?
[13:42:45] <Horacsio> (page 1) is dinamically inserted when orders are bigger than 8 per page
[13:42:54] <robertmaxrees> right.  your backend generates that for you.
[13:43:18] <robertmaxrees> backnforth still empty for me.  hrm.
[13:43:19] <Horacsio> and I can't figure out how it does, so
[13:43:35] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio heh fix that problem instead of trying to monkey-patch it with JS.
[13:43:44] <Horacsio> I need to look for character 6 and wrap the foloowing inside a span
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* good luck them.
[13:44:40] <Horacsio> ok rob a guy like you is just a full help! thank you ;)
[13:46:04] <backnforth> It's not empty anymore robertmaxrees
[13:46:27] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/1tVgJhv.png
[13:46:31] <robertmaxrees> still getting 164 bytes
[13:46:52] <robertmaxrees> ah figured out a way around it.
[13:47:32] <backnforth> works for me when I use git clone and when I downloaded a zip of the source
[13:47:38] <backnforth> You must still be using the old zip
[13:47:50] <robertmaxrees> going to the specific commit worked
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> funky cache.
[13:48:00] <backnforth> bah
[13:48:42] <robertmaxrees> aaaand clean console.
[13:48:43] <robertmaxrees> no issues.
[13:49:18] <backnforth> scroll your mouse over on the underscored dates
[13:49:24] <backnforth> That's when the error appears
[13:49:31] <robertmaxrees> boom. ther we go.
[13:50:41] <backnforth> A box is supposed to appear explaning the context of the used date
[13:51:03] <backnforth> and when clicking, a box is suppose to appear allowing a person to schedule
[13:51:26] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> you purposefulkly using an alpha of bootstrap 4?
[13:51:59] <backnforth> Doesn't have to be bootstrap 4
[13:52:45] <backnforth> Whatever this calendar wanted: http://www.bootstrap-year-calendar.com/
[13:53:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't use an alpha of bootstrap.
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> drop down to the last stable release.
[13:55:02] <backnforth> Eh, that fixed it
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> alpha releases are generally pretty buggy
[13:55:22] <backnforth> Darn :(
[13:55:27] <backnforth> I like using edge releases
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[13:55:38] <robertmaxrees> not in production at least.
[13:55:41] <robertmaxrees> wlel, depends.
[13:55:47] <robertmaxrees> when you say "edge" do you mean "latest"?
[13:55:53] <backnforth> yes
[13:55:56] <backnforth> "current"
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> 4.0.0 isn't current.
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> it's still being tested.
[13:56:12] <robertmaxrees> hence alpha.  not even beta.
[13:56:18] <backnforth> Yeah you're right
[13:59:16] <backnforth> robertmaxrees: On their example page, the first example "Full example" allows me to select dates and fill in an event for them
[13:59:26] <backnforth> I copied this example onto mine but I'm unable to do this
[13:59:31] <backnforth> Any idea why?
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> just to make sure i ask: did you hit up ##bootstrap?
[14:00:34] <backnforth> Yes, it's not responsive
[14:02:17] <robertmaxrees> there's no event-moda        console.log($('#event-modal'));
[14:02:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ see how nothing returns?
[14:05:58] <backnforth> I don't know what an event-moda is
[14:06:06] <backnforth> Other htan it hwas som ething to do with the calendar
[14:06:10] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the basics of jquery?
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> and bootstrap?
[14:06:22] <backnforth> Maybe not
[14:06:25] <backnforth> I've used both in production
[14:06:35] <backnforth> but don't know whether that means I know the basics of them
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think $('#event-modal') is trying to do?
[14:08:09] <backnforth> use the on-click event function
[14:08:16] <robertmaxrees> heh, nope.
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> $('#event-modal') is just selecting an element.
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> it's looking for $('#event-modal') and not finding it since it doesn't exist.
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> so you neet do create the element for it.
[14:09:37] <backnforth> Each date should be of that kind I assume
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:09:56] <robertmaxrees> 1: it's looking for the modal itself.
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> 2: you can't use an ID more than once per page.
[14:10:25] <backnforth> so I'm missing jQuery?
[14:10:34] <robertmaxrees> no...
[14:10:37] <robertmaxrees> you're missing html.
[14:10:39] <backnforth> what kind of elemetn is it
[14:11:10] <backnforth> ah, an element with that id
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> make sure it'
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> *it's a full modal tho.
[14:11:27] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap has conventions around that kind of stuff.
[14:11:43] <backnforth> what's a full modal? sorry for being bootsrap and jquery stupid
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap has conventions around what html you use for modals.
[14:12:15] <robertmaxrees> try inspecting one when you click on it.
[14:12:25] <robertmaxrees> and looka t the html
[14:12:52] <robertmaxrees> also kick at http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:13:27] <backnforth> ok
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> back.
[14:24:19] <backnforth> robertmaxrees: judging by that look it looks like modals are what is needed, but the example on the authors website doesn't show "modal" being used as a class.
[14:24:52] <robertmaxrees> did you try inspecting the modal from the example?
[14:25:18] <backnforth> Oh well I guess it does
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:25:28] <backnforth> :p
[14:25:40] <backnforth> but I'm not sure how to make my page display it now
[14:25:50] <backnforth> Just do I create the element for it
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> the example just didn't include the modal html.
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> just gotta satisfy that.
[14:34:13] <backnforth> robertmaxrees:
[14:34:14] <backnforth> it works
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:34:29] <backnforth> you were magnificent
[14:34:32] <backnforth> are*
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[14:34:40] <backnforth> how do I support you?
[14:34:43] <backnforth> you have a book?
[14:34:46] <robertmaxrees> thanks is enough.
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> hahaha nah
[14:34:58] <backnforth> you should
[14:35:01] <backnforth> robertmaxrees: jquery book
[14:35:02] <backnforth> I'd read it
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.org
[14:35:12] <robertmaxrees> that's a great book ;)
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> "book"
[14:35:21] <robertmaxrees> just about the basics, yo.
[14:49:50] <bjsnider> how do i display the return without the escapes and braces and so on? it look fine in the console but as append all of the json stuff is in there
[14:49:59] <bjsnider> does the .html method do that?
[14:50:10] <robertmaxrees> should.
[15:00:11] <bjsnider> well, that's one way to git 'er done. i just ripped out the php table code, put it in a function by itself in a separate file, and then called the function into json and pinged it back after the action code was done
[15:00:28] <robertmaxrees> i suggested that a while back.
[15:00:30] <bjsnider> rather than taking the table code and making a duplicate of it with javascript
[15:01:15] <bjsnider> i also tried that and it mostly worked, but it just seems like such a waste of time when the php is right there
[15:01:22] <robertmaxrees> nah
[15:01:27] <robertmaxrees> you need to use it in different places.
[15:02:28] <bjsnider> it says in the docs that $.each is able to iterate over objects as well as arrays
[15:02:40] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:02:51] <bjsnider> i was able to u se it as if the object was an associative array
[15:03:00] <robertmaxrees> that's still not a good idea.
[15:03:17] <robertmaxrees> it's not like taplar and I are just creating work.
[15:03:25] <robertmaxrees> it
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> *it's a more sensible format for what you're trying to do.
[15:08:59] <bjsnider> the code continues to execute after the checkbox length check fails
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> link?
[15:10:07] <bjsnider> i haven't changed that part of the code from yesterday
[15:10:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> heh do you expect me to still have the fiddle up?
[15:11:09] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vatLhgjg/3/
[15:11:25] <bjsnider> lines 6-8
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> because you only throw up an alert.
[15:11:53] <bjsnider> it's a legacy from only usiung html to post
[15:11:55] <robertmaxrees> gotta either return from there or wrap the rest in an else if
[15:12:28] <bjsnider> which would you recommend?
[15:12:45] <robertmaxrees> whichever convention your codebase tends to follow.
[15:13:50] <bjsnider> meh, return is easier
[15:14:03] <bjsnider> i wouldn't say i'm following many conventions atm
[15:14:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) hard for me to know without being in the codebase.
[16:08:51] <mrtAkdeniz> howdy!
[16:09:10] <mrtAkdeniz> guys, is there an alternative for change event of select ?
[16:10:10] <mrtAkdeniz> on page load, I'm changing value of a select from cookie, but I also want to if user change that, refresh page
[16:10:36] <mrtAkdeniz> but now it loops, because I can only listen that select's change with on("select" event..
[16:10:43] <mrtAkdeniz> so I need to find an alternative for that :\
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[16:54:10] <dcope> is it possible to pass a function to another function to be used as a callback?
[16:54:30] <qakhan> hi all, did someone try datatables wildcard .search() with *
[16:54:53] <qakhan> i want to use * for wildcard search
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> dcope yep - do it all the time.
[16:56:55] <dcope> robertmaxrees: awesome, worked exactly as i'd expect it to :D
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> dcope heh just do myFunction(someCallback) and you're done.
[16:58:08] <robertmaxrees> easy stuff.
[17:54:46] <GeekMonkey> hey I have been getting this error with my map api now
[17:54:47] <GeekMonkey> setIcon: not a string; and no url property; and no path property
[17:56:12] <robertmaxrees> make sure your types are right.
[17:56:46] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KbqjMIs-zLmTo8CqtuQ
[17:56:54] <GeekMonkey> It is working perfectly on another site
[17:57:06] <GeekMonkey> I just updated the wordpress version
[17:57:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd double-check that the types are correct.
[17:58:17] <GeekMonkey> does anything stand out on the code robertmaxrees?
[17:59:21] <robertmaxrees> .data() coerces things around.  .attr() always returns a string.
[17:59:36] <robertmaxrees> might check those.
[17:59:48] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/25873938/923919
[18:00:46] <GeekMonkey> so using parseFloat()
[18:03:42] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees that didn't work for me
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[18:04:10] <robertmaxrees> i might make sure you're htting the right version of their api.
[18:04:32] <GeekMonkey> ok will check that
[18:30:33] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees I updated the code
[18:30:42] <robertmaxrees> fixed it?
[18:30:46] <GeekMonkey> to show the php that is loading the api
[18:30:47] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KbqjMIs-zLmTo8CqtuQ
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php.
[18:31:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[18:31:59] <GeekMonkey> http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js
[18:32:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:32:28] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're lookin' for.
[18:32:40] <taplar> i think you can do document.head vs looking it up and doing [0]
[18:32:46] <taplar> fwiw
[18:32:53] <GeekMonkey> Is that the current api for google maps
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[18:33:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to look at their docs.
[18:53:42] <SlimmyJimmy> When I choose an <h3></h3> tag pair versus an <h1></h1> tag pair for the <div data-role="header"></div> content, the size of the text doesn't change. How can I fix this?
[18:54:05] <SlimmyJimmy> jQuery mobile question ^
[18:54:13] <robertmaxrees> css
[18:54:54] <SlimmyJimmy> Hmmm, all my titles (or a lot of them always require the 3 dots), jQuery doesn't accomodate for this?
[18:55:06] <SlimmyJimmy> Seems a little unbelievable
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:55:38] <robertmaxrees> how does it seem "unbelievable"?
[18:55:58] <SlimmyJimmy> The title only takes up half the space of the width of the app, why doesn't jQuery mobile expand it out?
[18:56:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're talking about.
[18:56:46] <SlimmyJimmy> Instead its putting up 3 dots and using only half the page width, like, there's a hard and fast rule about the page title "SHALL NOT" consume more than half the width space
[18:57:37] <robertmaxrees> that seems off.  can't seem to seeanything in the docs and demos that shows that behavior though.
[18:59:14] <SlimmyJimmy> Chrome shows margin is set to 30%, I think that's what's doing it
[18:59:26] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you're talking about?
[18:59:33] <robertmaxrees> even a screenshot for context would be nice.
[18:59:50] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, let me fix one up with my lovely SharX app. :)
[19:02:02] <SlimmyJimmy> https://puu.sh/tJ0Ee/f8913af101.png
[19:02:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  can you pop that in a fiddle?
[19:02:27] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be doing an ellipsis there.
[19:02:59] <SlimmyJimmy> I can try, It will take a few moments, I guess I need more practice at this stuff.
[19:05:06] <SlimmyJimmy> Right clicking the <h3></h3> shows margin: 30%; and text-overflow: ellipsis;  from jquery.mobile-1.4.5.css
[19:05:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:05:20] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) dunno.  i'd have to play with it.
[19:05:23] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[19:05:51] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees the api is updated the script works on another site
[19:06:03] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey so you figured it out?
[19:06:03] <GeekMonkey> could it be that the js is being loading before the api
[19:06:09] <GeekMonkey> nope
[19:06:11] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey no idea.
[19:06:42] <robertmaxrees> not super familiar with google maps.
[19:07:38] <SlimmyJimmy> I unchecked the "margin: 30%;" in Chrome and it shows the full text
[19:10:30] <SlimmyJimmy> So for long titles, jQuery keeps the margins at 30% like I said before, "THOU SHALL NOT" use more than 1/3 of the screen width for your mobile title.
[19:10:47] <robertmaxrees> that seems wrong to me.
[19:10:59] <robertmaxrees> my gut says there's a strange markup thing going on.
[19:11:11] <robertmaxrees> but since i don't have it in front of my i have no way of confirming.
[19:11:20] <SlimmyJimmy> Well, it's in jquery.mobile-1.4.5.css
[19:11:45] <robertmaxrees> right, so css can target through different elements to make different things happen depending on context.
[19:12:00] <SlimmyJimmy> .ui-header, .ui-title
[19:12:13] <robertmaxrees> can you show me in a fiddle?
[19:12:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd love to see it break.
[19:13:03] <SlimmyJimmy> I can try, you mean fiddle.net? I don't have much experience with it.
[19:13:10] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net.
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:13:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7td4y8j5/1/
[19:13:43] <robertmaxrees> this has jquery and the jqm js and css included.
[19:13:49] <robertmaxrees> just needs your basic markup snippet.
[19:16:39] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, I posted into that URL, can you see it? It works there but that's because I don't think it's running in a mobile width.
[19:17:04] <robertmaxrees> press "update" and share the new link.
[19:17:36] <SlimmyJimmy> Ah, yes, when I collapse my Chrome browser, it puts up the ellipsis again: https://jsfiddle.net/7td4y8j5/2/
[19:20:20] <robertmaxrees> sec
[19:20:28] <SlimmyJimmy> ok
[19:26:11] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  seems like they're trying to encourage shorter page titles if possible.  that's really strange to me.  either way, the easy fix is to override those styles.
[19:26:16] <robertmaxrees> but i agree that's strange.
[19:26:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7td4y8j5/3/
[19:27:09] <SlimmyJimmy> Well, keeping the space on each side just makes it stand out more, I can kinda see that. But it's a choice of standing out with ellipsis or seeing the full text...so...
[19:27:41] <robertmaxrees> easy enough override.
[19:28:35] <SlimmyJimmy> yes, margin: 0; that works for me, I do like it that way better I think.
[19:28:54] <robertmaxrees> margin: 0 auto;  you mean?
[19:28:56] <robertmaxrees> so it centers.
[19:29:13] <SlimmyJimmy> oh okay, I'll use that.
[19:37:08] <SlimmyJimmy> I see the problem, on screens where you have left and right bottoms on the sides of the title, you want that title only consuming 1/3 the space.
[19:37:33] <SlimmyJimmy> Otherwise, it looks silly, so....back to the way things were I guess. :)
[19:38:10] <SlimmyJimmy> buttons
[19:38:59] <robertmaxrees> heh there you go.
[19:39:14] <SlimmyJimmy> At least I understand why they do it that way now.
[19:55:44] <Sal> hi
[19:56:06] <robertmaxrees> good evening.
[19:56:48] <Sal> i'm playing around building a plugin for a button. I can't find a way to have an internal function with parameters, called from inseide and outside of the plugin
[19:57:05] <Sal> i have its name in the return, so i can see it outside of the plugin
[19:57:12] <Sal> its a disable function
[19:57:24] <robertmaxrees> care to share an example?
[19:57:29] <Sal> but i also need to calli it from inside
[20:00:14] <Sal> ok, i'll try to recreate something
[20:00:45] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy since you already have the code :)
[20:04:16] * robertmaxrees yawns
[20:06:03] <Sal> ok, here it is
[20:06:05] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/seqaxakuqa/edit?html,js,output
[20:06:12] <Sal> no error
[20:06:13] <Sal> sorry
[20:06:29] <robertmaxrees> so what're you trying to figure out?
[20:06:48] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/seqaxakuqa/edit?js
[20:07:01] <robertmaxrees> right, already looking there.
[20:07:15] <Sal> ok, in the return, i need to access the enable/disable functions on 1 button
[20:07:20] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[20:07:26] <Sal> and also outside
[20:07:38] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to do both $('sadf').disable() AND call disable internally.
[20:07:41] <Sal> i don't know how to tell it to do it only the button i want
[20:07:50] <Sal> yep
[20:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to extend jquery.
[20:08:02] <Sal> internally i pass the el parameter
[20:08:49] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[20:08:55] <robertmaxrees> this'll give you some good info.
[20:08:58] <Sal> i came from that
[20:09:06] <Sal> and it doesn't have what i need
[20:09:11] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[20:09:31] <robertmaxrees> just gotta take it across the finish line :)
[20:09:39] <Sal> i did
[20:09:49] <Sal> i also was thinking about doing it with widgets
[20:09:49] <robertmaxrees> lol one sec.
[20:10:02] <Sal> but, that only works with jquery UI, right?
[20:10:11] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to pull in the widget factory, yeah.
[20:10:14] <robertmaxrees> but you don't needf that.
[20:10:15] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[20:11:10] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/seqaxakuqa/edit?js
[20:11:21] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/d770df835e18
[20:11:23] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[20:11:29] <Sal> i could do the external this way, buti hate to repeat #btn
[20:12:01] <robertmaxrees> just gotta expose the ones you want.
[20:12:16] <Sal> hmm, that just to use the "this" ?
[20:12:32] <robertmaxrees> that's to get your method available on jquery.
[20:12:57] <robertmaxrees> allows you to explicitly define a nice little api.
[20:13:06] <Sal> s('#btn').disable('#btn');
[20:13:11] <Sal> that should work too
[20:13:12] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[20:13:16] <Sal> but its too ugly
[20:13:23] <robertmaxrees> right, that's why you use 'this'
[20:13:28] <Sal> hey, aint there a way to get the "this" from my functions?
[20:13:34] <Sal> maybe when el == undefined
[20:13:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:13:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:14:11] <robertmaxrees> 'this' references the jquery object that you selected.
[20:14:16] <robertmaxrees> it does that for you automatically.
[20:14:21] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have to pass stuff in.
[20:14:21] <Sal> the main problem is that its hard to debug with these damn playgroundsù
[20:14:43] <Sal> so, it should alreay work
[20:14:46] <robertmaxrees> no need to debug in there - the idea's pretty clear-cut.
[20:14:52] <Sal> no?
[20:14:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm not guaranteeing it'll work, but that's the general idea.
[20:15:05] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to try.
[20:15:05] <Sal> yes, its clear, but i like to follow the flow to be 100% clear
[20:15:06] <Sal> :)
[20:15:19] <robertmaxrees> heh, it's pretty straightforward.  give it a shot.
[20:15:34] <Sal> have any tip for debugging in these online tools?
[20:15:41] <robertmaxrees> console.log()
[20:15:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just edit your code.
[20:15:48] <robertmaxrees> and do it normally.
[20:15:59] <Sal> ok, thanks
[20:16:00] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#putting-it-together notice how they use 'this' in here to reference the selected elements?
[20:18:28] <Sal> oh, the return this
[20:18:36] <robertmaxrees> not just that.
[20:18:40] <robertmaxrees> this.filter( "a" ).each(function() {
[20:18:40] <Sal> i was looking at the "this" inside the loop
[20:18:46] <robertmaxrees> that's a jquery method.
[20:18:51] <Sal> ok
[20:18:56] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#using-the-each-method
[20:19:18] <Sal> ok
[20:19:25] <Sal> thanks again, i got that wrong
[20:19:33] <robertmaxrees> also: fwiw - https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#minimizing-plugin-footprint
[20:19:43] <Sal> i thought that the first this refers to the extracted element by each
[20:19:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:20:15] <robertmaxrees> you mean with return this.each(function() {});?
[20:21:01] <Sal> yep
[20:21:11] <Sal> a little bit confusing
[20:21:14] <robertmaxrees> 'this' there refers to the element itself.
[20:21:21] <robertmaxrees> rather, the collection.
[20:21:27] <robertmaxrees> not sure how that isn't clear, but okie :)
[20:21:28] <Sal> yes, the array
[20:21:34] <robertmaxrees> *not an array.
[20:21:37] <robertmaxrees> array-like.
[20:21:51] <Sal> yes, all the .js-btn found in page
[20:21:56] <Sal> right?
[20:22:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah - the jquery collection.
[20:22:03] <Sal> ok
[20:22:06] <robertmaxrees> subtly different from an array.
[20:22:17] <Sal> then the this inside the each() ?
[20:22:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a normal jquery each - so 'this' would be the dom node.
[20:22:32] <Sal> does that refer to the single element of the jquery collection?
[20:23:10] <Sal>             enable(el);
[20:23:10] <Sal>             enable(this);
[20:23:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:23:21] <Sal> are these two inside the each the same thing?
[20:23:35] <robertmaxrees> if you define that arg for each, basically.
[20:23:36] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/seqaxakuqa/edit?js
[20:23:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta go.
[20:23:44] <robertmaxrees> see you later.
[20:23:46] <Sal> ok, thanks
[20:38:00] <TomasElTigre> Using jQ mobile, I'm getting a bit of text - "Search" - added to my form text input. How can I get rid of this?
