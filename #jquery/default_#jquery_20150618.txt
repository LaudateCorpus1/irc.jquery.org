[00:00:08] <Max-P> walabe: Some kind of extension maybe? It really just change the transform CSS property, so either it doesn't update it or somehow yours doesn't support transform
[00:00:39] <Max-P> Which isn't impossible if it doesn't recognize your graphics card as good enough
[00:00:46] <walabe> Max-P hmm, yeah I've been having issues with things like this every now and then. It's odd, they work on IE but not my chrome. Maybe it's an extension
[00:04:46] <Max-P> walabe: chrome://gpu
[00:06:02] <walabe> "ERROR:gpu_video_decode_accelerator.cc(276)] : HW video decode not available for profile" does that sound like an issue?
[00:06:45] <Max-P> Nah, that's just for video playback like YouTube
[00:07:36] <walabe> only other notable thing is: "Canvas: Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable"
[00:07:56] <Max-P> I have the same
[00:08:12] <walabe> Oh okay, well damn
[00:08:34] <Max-P> Have you tried right-click -> inspect on the image on the demo page and see if the image CSS changes? And maybe try -webkit-transform instead of just transform
[00:09:03] <Max-P> Well nevermind, it actually uses both
[00:10:23] <Cork> if you use the prefix version ALWAYS use the unprefixed version too
[00:19:14] <Afdla> is it possible to trigger event without specific target or do I just use $(document).trigger("custom-event") and listen to that?
[00:19:50] <Cork> Afdla: if you don't have a target i would argue you shouldn't use events
[00:21:35] <Afdla> I have js in different files and I would like to notify a change in one file and the other file would listen to the change event and act accordingly
[00:21:50] <Cork> Afdla: js doesn't care about files
[00:21:57] <Afdla> calling a function in another file makes the files dependent on each other
[00:22:03] <Cork> just expose a name and provide callbacks though it
[00:22:41] <Afdla> now I didn't quite understand
[00:22:42] <Cork> so?, just check if the name exist before calling it
[00:23:31] <Cork> window.myCustomerCallbacks = {}; var manager = $.Callbacks(); window.myCustomerCallbacks.callback1 = manager.add;
[00:23:34] <Cork> for example
[00:25:42] <Afdla> alright, thanks
[00:25:44] <Afdla> I'll look into it
[00:26:08] <hellyeah> need some help
[00:27:15] <hellyeah> i want to get header title of table but i couldnt how can i do that in pop up box when you click example name or other row value you will see all related row need header title also
[00:27:19] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/30/
[00:28:50] <Cork> hellyeah: $(this).closest('table').find('thread td:first-child').text()
[00:29:23] <hellyeah> to clonedTHead?
[00:29:33] <Cork> why do you want to clone the head?
[00:30:03] <hellyeah> well http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/42/ mt thead normally look like that http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/42/
[00:30:15] <Cork> also never EVER do '[class^=hidden-]'
[00:30:19] <hellyeah> sorry for pasting second time
[00:30:30] <hellyeah> Cork:  why
[00:30:43] <hellyeah> is it depreceated too?
[00:30:43] <Cork> cause your hacking around the fact that you constructing the classes wrong
[00:30:54] <Cork> no, you make attribute selectors instead of class selectors
[00:31:12] <hellyeah> how can i fix?
[00:31:21] <Cork> change class="hidden-xs" to class="hidden xs"
[00:31:31] <Cork> hidden-stuff => hidden stuff
[00:31:54] <Cork> never create compound class names (where the class have two meanings)
[00:32:16] <hellyeah> will it work not http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/44/
[00:32:26] <hellyeah> now*
[00:32:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/45/
[00:33:02] <Cork> but basically yes
[00:33:35] <Cork> now i just have to figure out what you're trying to do with the thead
[00:33:37] <hellyeah> but class name is hidden-xs will it remove that
[00:33:43] <hellyeah> okey
[00:33:49] <Cork> you should rename the class
[00:33:51] <Cork> like i said
[00:34:06] <Cork> currently you have 3 classes for "hidden" you should have one
[00:34:13] <hellyeah> it is bootstrap class
[00:34:18] <Cork> ugg...
[00:34:32] <hellyeah> bootstrap has hidden-xs hidden-md and hidden-lg for table
[00:34:50] <Cork> lovely...
[00:34:58] <hellyeah> this classes uses for hiding column information in some device
[00:35:07] <hellyeah> like mobile small screeen devices
[00:35:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/46/ then
[00:35:35] <Cork> hellyeah: it doesn't change that they create broken classes
[00:35:48] <hellyeah> i see
[00:36:04] <Cork> so what exactly are you trying to do?
[00:36:22] <Cork> you want to show the table including the hidden columns in the popup?
[00:36:35] <hellyeah> well if you look at this and click examplename you will get all row value in pop up box http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/30/
[00:36:51] <hellyeah> this show also hidden row in the table
[00:37:05] <Cork> uh columns not rows
[00:37:06] <hellyeah> but in my situtation i have to hide header information too
[00:37:35] <Cork> hellyeah: i'm quite sure the code is overcomplicated
[00:37:41] <hellyeah> when you click example name you will get column information in the same row with related header information
[00:37:45] <Cork> but i need to know what effect you're looking for to clean it up
[00:38:09] <Cork> ok, so the clicked row and the header with the hidden columns visible, nothing else?
[00:38:26] <hellyeah> Cork:  check this click example name http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/46/
[00:38:50] <Cork> ... is that a yes?
[00:38:58] <hellyeah> yes
[00:38:59] <toomus> Can someone recommend some jquery emoticons plugin?
[00:43:12] <Cork> hellyeah: so something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/47/
[00:46:22] <hellyeah> Cork:  my english is kinda bad actually it is like that http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/43/
[00:46:51] <Cork> code wise i don't see the difference
[00:48:56] <Cork> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/48/
[00:49:38] <hellyeah> yep http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/49/
[00:51:37] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie hard to follow those function. Selector version is easier to understand
[00:52:00] <Cork> line 2 clones the current table
[00:52:13] <Cork> line 3 selects all tbody rows
[00:52:37] <Cork> line 4 gets the line number of the currently clicked row and selects the same row in the cloned table
[00:52:47] <Cork> then it removes all rows except that row
[00:52:58] <Cork> and then it gives the result table to showPopup
[00:53:24] <Cork> so $(this).closest('tr').index() current row index
[00:53:36] <hellyeah> rows.not(rows.eq($(this).closest('tr').index())).remove();
[00:53:51] <Cork> rows.eq(<number>) selects the row with the same row index
[00:54:00] <hellyeah> row.not
[00:54:18] <Cork> rows.not(<element>).remove() remove all elements except the one passed to .not
[00:54:30] <Cork> (in the set)
[00:55:49] <hellyeah> ic
[01:14:09] <newbie> can i get support here about jquery dialog box
[01:14:26] <Cork> ?ask @ hellyeah-work
[01:14:42] <Cork> sigh... the bots dead again...
[01:14:48] <Cork> hellyeah: just ask the question
[01:15:13] <hellyeahsighbot> :XD
[01:15:38] <hellyeahsighbot> i want to design dialog boxes
[01:15:42] <hellyeahsighbot> i want to design dialog box
[01:15:54] <hellyeah-work> situtation is like that
[01:15:57] <Cork> please stop playing with the nick...
[01:16:12] <hellyeah-work> sorry
[01:16:16] <Cork> the style is just css change it how ever you like
[01:16:37] <hellyeah-work> now dialog boxes looks like that http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/48/
[01:16:50] <hellyeah-work> but this appearence is not good for small screen devices
[01:17:04] <hellyeah-work> basically i want to rotate my dialog boxes vertically
[01:17:21] * Cork points at his last comment
[01:18:05] <hellyeah-work> what i mean is it looks horizontally now
[01:18:16] <hellyeah-work> it is good for wide screen
[01:18:32] <hellyeah-work> but it should look vertical in small screen
[01:18:34] <Cork> so change the design
[01:18:40] <hellyeah-work> hope you understand what i mean
[01:18:43] <Cork> like i said its css change it how ever you like
[01:19:25] <hellyeah-work> do i need to style in javascript or can i do that from css file
[01:19:48] <hellyeah-work> #popup
[01:19:52] <Cork> styling doesn't belong in js
[01:20:05] <Cork> so no you do it in css
[01:21:14] <hellyeah-work> http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/50/ but not working
[01:21:27] <hellyeah-work> i just wrote width and height in css file
[01:21:39] <Cork> uh
[01:21:42] <hellyeah-work> should i ask in #css channel
[01:21:46] <hellyeah-work> or can i ask here?
[01:22:01] <Cork> you should read the documentation for the jquery ui theme
[01:22:16] <Cork> and use the dom inspector to see what elements to style
[01:22:24] <hellyeah-work> jquery ui theme
[01:22:25] <hellyeah-work> hmm
[01:23:31] <hellyeah-work> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-massive-guide-to-custom-theming-jquery-ui-widgets--net-22714
[01:23:35] <hellyeah-work> does it seem good
[01:30:07] <hellyeah-work> Cork:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1308369/jquery-ui-dialog-individual-css-styling this question show they design in js
[01:30:40] <Cork> no, it adds extra classes in js
[01:30:52] <Cork> so it can have different dialogs have different designs
[01:31:10] <Cork> if you just want to change how the default design looks you don't need that
[01:33:25] <hellyeah-work> actually design is okey
[01:33:31] <hellyeah-work> i just wanna do smt like
[01:33:41] <Cork> change how it looks
[01:33:44] <Cork> and that is what css does
[01:33:51] <hellyeah-work> okey
[01:33:53] <hellyeah-work> hmm
[01:34:04] <hellyeah-work> in mobile devices
[01:34:19] <Cork> well the best way to handle that is screen sizes
[01:34:23] <hellyeah-work> if my dialog box look like that it exceed the boundaries of screen
[01:34:31] <Cork> and that is done though media queries
[01:34:37] <hellyeah-work> they will have to scroll left
[01:34:54] <hellyeah-work> bootstrap may work
[01:35:53] <hellyeah-work> let me ask in bootstrap channel
[01:36:01] <Cork> ...
[01:36:14] <Cork> it should still be styling -_-'
[01:36:28] <hellyeah-work> yes
[01:36:39] <Cork> so what does it matter what lib you're using?
[01:36:40] <hellyeah-work> but bootstrap has built in media queries
[01:36:45] <Cork> uh...
[01:36:52] <hellyeah-work> :XD
[01:36:54] <Cork> so does every browser...
[01:37:14] <hellyeah-work> i.e. might be problematic
[01:37:29] <hellyeah-work> also his query dialog boxes oes not work on iceweasel and chromium
[01:37:40] <hellyeah-work> i have also debian installed
[01:37:46] <hellyeah-work> that is not wokring there
[01:37:52] <Cork> no it won't if you stop trying to do copy/paste programming and actually start modifying it the way you want it to behave/look
[01:39:30] <hellyeah-work> i dont do copy paste programming btw
[01:39:38] <hellyeah-work> i just try to learn stuff
[01:48:53] <hellyeah-work> Cork:  it may work for my needs https://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[01:51:22] <Cork> uh... jquery ui is resizable by default
[01:51:28] <Cork> i meant ui dialog
[01:52:12] <hellyeah-work> yes
[01:52:19] <hellyeah-work> i didnt realized that
[01:52:27] <walabe> Not sure if my issue is a jquery issue or a css... I'm trying to use the jquery plugin thing, that makes a paralax effect on an image. However, it's making the div it's targeting fall out of its wrapper div
[01:52:39] <hellyeah-work> but i can make it auto resizable according to screen resolution
[01:53:02] <Cork> walabe: you need overflow: hidden on the parent
[01:53:16] <walabe> oooooo let me try that
[01:53:45] <Cork> hellyeah-work: resize doens't mean scale it means that the elements width/height can be dragged
[01:54:19] <hellyeah-work> so i need scale?
[01:54:35] <Cork> no, you need restyle so you can move things around to take up less space
[01:55:17] <hellyeah-work> humm
[01:55:30] <hellyeah-work> for that i have to read jquery ui and check what options i have
[01:55:45] <Cork> no it isn't options
[01:55:50] <Cork> its styling => css
[01:55:58] <Cork> like i told you before
[01:56:59] <hellyeah-work> yes i know
[01:57:02] <hellyeah-work> hmm
[01:57:16] <hellyeah-work> but when i give width and height in css it doesnt accept
[01:57:30] <hellyeah-work> it accept if i give width and height in cs
[01:57:31] <hellyeah-work> s
[01:57:48] <Cork> so you just want to change the width of the dialog?
[01:57:52] <walabe> If you need css help hellyea-work try #css they are helpful as well
[01:57:59] <Cork> you said you wanted to make it take less space
[01:58:27] <Cork> cause sure, if you want to just get it to be smaller just set width/height in the .dialog call
[01:58:39] <Cork> but that won't change the size of the titlebar or move it to a different position
[01:58:49] <hellyeah-work> http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/51/
[01:58:59] <hellyeah-work> i am just trying
[01:59:04] <hellyeah-work> this is not what i want
[01:59:35] <hellyeah-work> change width and height according to screen size
[02:00:29] <hellyeah-work> also Cork the appearence of width and height of dialog box will change the looks of table
[02:01:36] <hellyeah-work> anywy let me try later with an example
[02:01:39] <hellyeah-work> thanks for help
[02:08:57] <tty> olá! i have a two cross-domain applications that i want to have the same sidebar for chat and some other options. at the moment i inject the sidebar on each app by loading first the css of the sidebar, then jquery and a js file that injects the remote html using ajax like this http://pastebin.com/ZV5yEcRW. 1. is there a better way to do this? 2. can i do this to load an angularjs/js app?
[02:11:09] <tty> this sidebar is like an “identity bar”.
[02:39:42] <Meir`> tty, i think it's more correct to handle this through a js file
[02:40:21] <Meir`> which injectes the contents of "topnav.html" programmatically
[02:40:31] <Meir`> like most of jquery plugins
[02:40:37] <tty> Meir`: this is what i am doing now i think.
[02:41:09] <Meir`> sorry, i didn't define it correctly
[02:42:29] <Meir`> i meant that instead of injecting html, you can create DOM elements
[02:42:55] <Meir`> then you simply refer this .js in both apps
[02:43:17] <Meir`> and this way, should have cross domain issues
[02:43:28] <Meir`> should not have**

[03:36:49] <Kartagis> hi. why would I be getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/ubw9ev11/ ? the author says the returned json should have the format {"nodes":[{"node":{ but my json already has that format
[03:37:38] <Cork> Kartagis: is the server returning the correct content-type?
[03:37:55] <Kartagis> aye
[03:38:07] <Kartagis> it's json
[03:38:19] <Kartagis> how can I verify that?
[03:38:29] <Cork> check the network tab in the developer console
[03:38:42] <Cork> the http header should state Content-Type: application/json
[03:40:03] <Kartagis> Cork: Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[03:40:30] <Cork> wait a min
[03:40:37] <Cork> the json respons isn't correct
[03:41:02] <Cork> Kartagis: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[03:41:20] <Cork> so it should be an array of strings or an array of objects with the keys label/value
[03:41:33] <Cork> not an object with an array of objects with node
[03:47:11] <Kartagis> Cork: so, my json is an object with an array of objects?
[03:48:13] <hellyeah> the behaivour of pup up box is normal http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/55/
[03:50:46] <Cork> Kartagis: yes { "nodes": {} } object 1
[03:50:55] <Cork> Kartagis: opps : [] not : {}
[03:51:05] <Kartagis> heh
[03:51:09] <Cork> Kartagis: then you have [{}] that is an array of objects
[03:51:23] <Cork> then you have { "node": <something> }
[03:51:34] <Cork> what you should have is [{ label: "", value: ""}]
[03:51:47] <Cork> cause that is what autocomplete looks for
[03:51:55] <testJQ> Can someone help me out with Jquery? +D
[03:52:58] <Kartagis> https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete/issues/88#issuecomment-20881536 the author says here my format is correct, unless we are talking about different stuff
[03:53:09] <DarsVaeda> so I finally finished my date range picker adaption...everything works fine except if you first click on the "to" field, if you click on the "from" field first and then the "to" field you see the difference -> http://jsfiddle.net/k44vstpj/
[03:53:30] <DarsVaeda> can anyone have a look at this? I miss the forest for the trees I think
[03:53:34] <Kartagis> testJQ: try asking. it's the only way to find out
[03:54:12] <testJQ> I'm trying to loop through 10 divs, and echo out all the fields inside and the div title, but when I try and output the title, it outputs all the titles at once
[03:54:27] <Kartagis> testJQ: testcase?
[03:56:08] <Cork> Kartagis: that would have to be converted for jquery autocomplete to understand it
[03:56:33] <testJQ> the code is a bit too convoluted to jsfiddle it
[03:56:42] <Cork> cause, no jquery doesn't understand suggestions: [{value: "", data: ""}]
[03:56:57] <Kartagis> testJQ: unless you do, we can't help you
[03:57:01] <Cork> (they might expect you to use something other then the built in autocomplete)
[03:57:24] <Kartagis> and no, we are not going to rewrite your code
[03:58:22] <testJQ> https://jsfiddle.net/htdnxkmt/1/
[03:58:36] <testJQ> there u go
[04:00:07] * Kartagis feels this is not the whole thing
[04:00:18] <Kartagis> where are the divs?
[04:00:25] <testJQ> ill mock some up
[04:01:58] <DarsVaeda> hurray posting to the channel help finding the problem myself :D
[04:02:22] <testJQ> hmm it actually seems to work, I think I was doing something outside the each, I'll see if I can fix it..
[04:02:43] <Bjerre> Hey guys, Uhkis are you here? Wondering what to do to make the next and forward button to work as intended. Right now they are targeting a specific button instead of selecting the next one in a order. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/47/
[04:07:23] <testJQ> ah crap
[04:07:43] <testJQ> any idea how I can check if a div has values in its children before I echo that divs title?
[04:07:57] <morlenxus> Hey, i have a question what jquery $(function () { ... }); does? It looks like functions, which are defined inside aren't accessable from outside.
[04:13:49] <Cork> morlenxus: $(func) is a short hand for $(document).ready(func)
[04:14:08] <Cork> so http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[04:15:23] <morlenxus> oooh
[04:15:44] <morlenxus> Didn't expect that. :) Thanks
[04:16:11] <Cork> morlenxus: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[04:16:23] <Cork> there you have everything jQuery can do in it's main function
[04:16:48] <morlenxus> Thanks!
[04:16:56] <Bjerre> cork do you know how to solve the clickproblem on this? There will be 8 buttons in total but only 1 back and 1 forwards button (like in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/47/ ). So what I need is something that checks the current clicked button and then goes to the next or previous one on forwards/backbutton
[04:18:05] <Bjerre> the reason why I need that is obviously because there is 8 buttons but only 1 back/forward. But since you can click on the buttons but also on the back/previous button there must be a way to find out which one is triggered
[04:18:06] <Cork> Bjerre: well give them an id and check that
[04:18:32] <Bjerre> dont know on how to check it Cork
[04:18:36] <Bjerre> :/
[04:18:42] <Cork> this.id
[04:19:46] <Bjerre> shouldnt I add a better id than I have now if so? Like button[1] or something?
[04:19:51] <Bjerre> Im really lost Cork
[04:21:00] <Uhkis> so many ways to implement that
[04:21:27] <Bjerre> or can I call it with 'button' ++ [0] or something?
[04:22:15] <Bjerre> I found out the correct data-target btw Uhkis  :D
[04:22:26] <Bjerre> silly me was tired yesterday
[04:23:30] <hellyeah> hey how can i header and row value row by row instead of this appearence http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/55/
[04:24:18] <taplar> what is the issue?
[04:24:34] <Kartagis> so Cork, if I want to use only 1 field in that json, is that possible?
[04:24:56] <Cork> Kartagis: sure, replace source with a function and translate it to what you need
[04:25:05] <Bjerre> hi taplar
[04:25:13] <taplar> morning Bjerre
[04:25:52] <taplar> hellyeah: sorry, i'm not understanding the issue.  what are you trying to fix?
[04:26:02] <Kartagis> Cork: care to give an example?
[04:26:30] <Cork> Kartagis: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[04:26:34] <Cork> the "Function" section
[04:26:35] <hellyeah> the appearence on pup up boxes can be vertical?
[04:27:33] <hellyeah> this is horizontal appearence.
[04:27:48] <hellyeah> some screen are small
[04:28:01] <hellyeah> if my boxes look like that user have to scroll left and right
[04:28:08] <hellyeah> or*
[04:28:22] <taplar> so your wanting to conditionally rotate it?
[04:28:38] <hellyeah> yes
[04:28:53] <hellyeah> if it is possibl
[04:29:12] <taplar> i'll have to defer that to another chatter.  haven't had much experience with mobiles or viewports yet
[04:29:18] <Cork> hellyeah: i already answered this... why are you asking again?
[04:29:35] <Cork> use css media queries
[04:29:56] <hellyeah> ic
[04:30:13] <hellyeah> actually this is what i want in final step
[04:30:16] <Cork> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[04:30:50] <hellyeah> just wondering if it is vertical appearence in box is possible instead of horizontal
[04:31:18] <Cork> anything you can do with css is
[04:31:35] <Cork> and if you need you can use js, but most of the time you don't
[04:33:46] <taplar> been meaning to eventually get an ipod touch again so i could experiment on small touch screens.  seems fun
[04:34:03] <Bjerre> Uhkis: If I want to do it the easiest way that simulate a clicking of the button (to invoke all the other functions), what would you recommend me doing? I need it to check the active button first since there will be 8 (blue orange etc) buttons that are also clickable?
[04:34:08] <Cork> taplar: you can do that in chrome and firefox today
[04:34:17] <Cork> (without a device)
[04:34:34] <taplar> Cork: you can simulate the touchscreen actions too?
[04:34:39] <Cork> yes
[04:34:43] <taplar> interesting
[04:36:10] <Uhkis> Bjerre: what's the fiddle again?
[04:36:51] <Bjerre> Sorry, forgot to post it: here Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/47/
[04:37:28] <Bjerre> I added some click simulation but it's only targeting the specific button which is how it not is supposed to be
[04:38:43] <taplar> Bjerre: are you going to have more that two images?
[04:39:32] <Bjerre> yes
[04:39:34] <Bjerre> 8 images
[04:39:36] <Bjerre> 8 buttons
[04:39:41] <Bjerre> 1 previous, 1 next
[04:40:55] <taplar> what i might suggest then is placing a data-refid="" on the buttons.  keep a javascript variable that has the displayed refid [1-8].  on back, decrement, on next, increment, then use that to know which button to click
[04:41:10] <ee> Hello, I'd like to ask someone for a little bit of help. I am stuck on my project, because of my bad jquery knowledge. I think my problem is actually very simple for someone with knowledge.
[04:41:23] <taplar> !ask @ ee
[04:41:27] <R13ose> hi
[04:41:32] <taplar> bah
[04:41:36] <ee> I need to check whether a div element is shown, and if it is, then I need to activate a click event
[04:41:42] <ee> can someone help me with this?
[04:41:56] <taplar> ee: you mean if it is visible?
[04:42:00] <Bjerre> oh I see taplar
[04:42:37] <ee> yes, if it is inside the viewport
[04:42:45] <ee> the div element in question will be transparent
[04:43:01] <ee> I just need it to get "clicked on" when the user scrolls down to it
[04:43:04] <taplar> crud, room, is transparent still :visible?
[04:43:20] <ee> css opacity 0 is what I've been thinking
[04:43:25] <R13ose> I trying to upgrade this code: http://pastebin.com/3UWVU921 to using youtube api v3 and can't figure out how to do this.  Any ideas?
[04:43:31] <Bjerre> yes it is I think taplar
[04:43:44] <Bjerre> because it will be clickable if transparent
[04:43:54] <taplar> ee: try if ( $(selector).is(':visible') { $(anotherselector).click(); }
[04:44:07] <taplar> ee: try if ( $(selector).is(':visible') ) { $(anotherselector).click(); }
[04:44:28] <ee> won't this activate the anotherselector on page load?
[04:44:37] <taplar> just a syntax example
[04:44:44] <taplar> manipulate to your pleasure, :)
[04:45:25] <ee> yeah, sure. what I meant was does :visible check for viewport (screen) or the entire website?
[04:46:02] <taplar> :visible should be if it does not have display:none applied
[04:46:11] <ee> let me explain a bit better. :) on the bottom of my blog there's a button which loads more items. I want the items to load automatically. So I thought the easiest way would be to have a click event when users scroll to the bottom
[04:47:02] <taplar> sure
[04:48:29] <ee> something like this?
[04:48:30] <ee> jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[04:48:30] <ee>     var loadmore = $('.loadmore-more');
[04:48:31] <ee>     $(document).on('scroll', function(){
[04:48:31] <ee>         if (loadmore.visible(true)){
[04:48:31] <ee>             loadmore.trigger('click');
[04:48:31] <ee>         }
[04:48:31] <ee>     });
[04:48:32] <ee> });
[04:48:33] <ee> shit sorry
[04:48:40] <Bjerre> are you using visibility = hidden or display = none?
[04:49:08] <ee> i though i'd use CSS and set transparency
[04:49:10] <ee> (opacity)
[04:49:13] <ee> to 0
[04:49:16] <Bjerre> ?paste @ee
[04:49:20] <ee> here's a normal pastebin link
[04:49:20] <ee> http://pastebin.com/TrF4Qfk5
[04:50:18] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/48/
[04:51:44] <ee> or should it be something more like this?http://pastebin.com/6Xm0fns5
[04:51:54] <hellyeah> hey what is wrong here why it doesnt work can you help me to fix http://jsfiddle.net/saLb7g0x/2/
[04:52:55] <taplar> ee: i've done that before.  in my case i did it with some math on the elements offsetTop, document height, and vertical scroll distance to know if the element has come into view.  dunno if there is an easier jquery way
[04:53:02] <R13ose> hellyeah: you have to tell us what is not working
[04:53:18] <R13ose> ee: please don't paste code, using pastebin or something similar.
[04:53:48] <ee> yeah i didn't know that'd happen. :) i've started using pastebin. :)
[04:54:12] <ee> @taplar what about this  https://www.customd.com/articles/13/checking-if-an-element-is-visible-on-screen-using-jquery
[04:54:50] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[04:55:17] <taplar> ee: seems like what you want, and most likely the .visible( true ) varriant
[04:55:53] <hellyeah> R13ose:  i am using pop up dialog box in this example it worked smoothly http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/55/ but it is not working here i cannot get pop up box working http://jsfiddle.net/saLb7g0x/2/ can you tell me how can i fix it_
[04:57:42] <R13ose> hellyeah: first can you fix up your html, this looks like a mess.
[04:58:13] <hellyeah> it is not my html it is generated automatically by asp.net i have to work with this html unfortunately
[05:01:11] <Bjerre> Uhkis: the god of code is back. Amazing!
[05:01:16] <R13ose> hellyeah: that sucks really does.  In the end, I think this comes down to your html and missing ids and classes that are needed from where I see things.
[05:01:51] <R13ose> What about my question?
[05:01:52] <Bjerre> is it possible to make it go to button 1 if you press next when active on last button? Same as if you're on the first and go back?
[05:01:55] <Uhkis> Bjerre: :D
[05:02:03] <taplar> Bjerre: use %
[05:02:08] <Bjerre> Thank you so much Uhkis
[05:03:02] <Bjerre> It's midsummer here in sweden, if you want I can send you some snaps Uhkis
[05:03:16] <Uhkis> here as well
[05:04:13] <Bjerre> well do you have any snaps?
[05:04:45] <R13ose> :(
[05:04:46] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/49/
[05:04:50] <Bjerre> hello R13ose
[05:05:21] <R13ose> Hi
[05:05:35] <hellyeah> R13ose:  this is not my markup this is asp.net markup and asp.net sucks
[05:05:46] <Bjerre> buttons.eq Uhkis? what does that even mean
[05:05:50] <Bjerre> it sure works though
[05:05:55] <Bjerre> splendid! <3
[05:06:00] <R13ose> hellyeah: I understood that the first time you said that but that is what is missing to make this work.
[05:06:12] <Uhkis> ?api eq @ Bjerre
[05:06:12] <b-ot> Bjerre: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:06:13] <hellyeah> ah
[05:06:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:06:23] <Bjerre> aah
[05:06:56] <hellyeah> worked without id http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/55/
[05:07:29] <R13ose> hellyeah: which id?
[05:08:02] <hellyeah> td id
[05:09:00] <R13ose> hellyeah: I am not sure what you are talking about but you have to run the code again to see if this works.  I am sure on what I am saying.
[05:09:02] <taplar> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/51/ <---- continuous looping
[05:10:32] <Bjerre> ok explain taplar
[05:10:38] <Bjerre> why did yours work in the real project
[05:10:40] <Bjerre> but not Uhkis
[05:10:49] <taplar> the continuous part?
[05:10:50] <Bjerre> Uhkis: worked with back button
[05:10:54] <Bjerre> yours work with both
[05:11:05] <Bjerre> yes
[05:11:12] <Bjerre> the continuing worked with yours
[05:11:19] <taplar> on the next button i changed the formula to use modulus (%)
[05:11:40] <Bjerre> I've not used modulus that much, what difference does it make?
[05:11:54] <taplar> modulus gives you the remainder of a division operation
[05:12:05] <taplar> so for instance 5%4 = 1
[05:12:13] <Bjerre> ye I know
[05:12:21] <taplar> k so your valid range is 1-8
[05:12:24] <Bjerre> don't get the difference though
[05:12:50] <taplar> we take the modulos of the next index to wrap
[05:12:59] <taplar> 9 % 8 = 1
[05:13:01] <Bjerre> ok I'm starting to get it
[05:14:19] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[05:14:35] <Bjerre> Thank you both for taking your time once again.
[05:14:56] <Bjerre> Couldnt be better than this taplar
[05:15:04] <Bjerre> R13ose: what was your question again?
[05:15:12] <taplar> i don't know that i agree with that
[05:15:15] <taplar> heh
[05:15:31] <R13ose> I trying to upgrade this code: http://pastebin.com/3UWVU921 to using youtube api v3 and can't figure out how to do this.  Any ideas?
[05:15:31] <Bjerre> taplar you're a perfectionist
[05:15:36] <Uhkis> it could be way better, but that would need a complete rewrite
[05:15:52] <taplar> i like to consider it just having an open mind, ;)
[05:16:59] <Uhkis> R13ose: 1) read the new api documentation 2) change #81 accordingly
[05:17:34] <R13ose> Uhkis: you think that is all I need to do?  I have been reading but been confused.
[05:17:39] <Bjerre> it works as intended, that's all I care about right now. By the way, got a little question for taplar and Uhkis. I got a message that I have a place in the two universitys that I applied for. One of them seems to go all in on .NET and the other one is more about frontend developement with javascript as main code. What would you chose? I have no knowledge of C# so I think the latter one is better in my taste.
[05:18:31] <taplar> Bjerre: what is your carreer goal?
[05:18:37] <Uhkis> R13ose: iirc that url and parameters were the only thing that changed
[05:20:11] <Uhkis> Bjerre: you're thinking it all wrong ;) you already have knowledge of frontend dev, so what's the point of learning something you already know
[05:20:20] <Bjerre> I'm not sure taplar, but I love to do things like this. As you're well aware of I am in need of a lot of help so my goal would be to make things by myself and be able to help others like you. Regarding career there has to be jobs, I'm not going to university once again and once done with it can't find any related jobs.
[05:21:29] <Bjerre> Uhkis: Well getting better at it is a plus :)
[05:21:56] <Uhkis> Bjerre: hanging out here, reading solutions and helping others gets you tons of jquery knowledge
[05:21:59] <R13ose> Uhkis: nice.  I am still confused.
[05:22:32] <Bjerre> true Uhkis
[05:22:33] <Uhkis> when i originally joined, i had pretty much basics of jquery only, now you call me god of code ;D
[05:22:46] <Bjerre> well sir you are (and don't forget taplar)
[05:22:54] <Bjerre> there are actually 2 gods
[05:22:56] <Bjerre> :)
[05:23:23] <Uhkis> yeah, Cork and robertmaxrees
[05:23:37] <Uhkis> decx is also awesome
[05:23:47] <Bjerre> ye but I was talking about gods that were awake
[05:23:50] <Bjerre> :D
[05:24:04] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees is like Kraken
[05:24:06] <Cork> i'm awake, just busy
[05:24:13] <Bjerre> oh crap, 3 then
[05:32:50] <Bjerre> taplar: If I want to bind left arrow on the keyboard to go back as well, just like the button do, is this the variable where I add it in? var $backbutton = $('.back');
[05:33:52] <taplar> sorry, had to handle a git issue
[05:34:15] <Bjerre> $(document).keydown(function(e) {     switch(e.which) {         case 37: // left         break;
[05:34:26] <Bjerre> for the left arrow
[05:35:12] <VanReyes> Evening Everyone. How can change my date from "2015-Ene-2" to "2015-Ene-02" in jquery
[05:35:41] <Bjerre> paste the code at jsfiddle.net VanReyes
[05:36:48] <taplar> Bjerre: personally, i'd go the .NET path.  primarily for this reason.  i went to college for C/C++, but now I do java/groovy/grails.  for a bit I was training to learn Cobol.  the point to this is, I don't use C/C++ that I was academically trained in, but I DO use all the concepts I learned.  concepts for for the most part universal and can be applied across languages.
[05:36:55] <R13ose> Uhkis: in the key={YOUR_API_KEY} if I am doing this for someone else, does that mean they have to get an API Key or can I setup one for their youtube channel on my own?
[05:38:47] <Bjerre> I see taplar
[05:39:08] <Bjerre> 3 people out of 3 have told me to go .NET path now
[05:39:45] <VanReyes> I want to change from "2015-06-2" to "2015-06-02" in jquery, just adding 0 from 1 to 9
[05:39:46] <VanReyes> I tried like this.
[05:39:48] <VanReyes> http://bin.fuelphp.com/snippet/view/KJ
[05:40:07] <VanReyes> But the result also affected others. :(
[05:40:47] <VanReyes> Like "02015-06-02".
[05:41:45] <Bjerre> possible to make the year like a variable?
[05:41:56] <Bjerre> year-month-day
[05:42:02] <VanReyes> No
[05:42:03] <Bjerre> then only change the day var?
[05:42:06] <Bjerre> ok
[05:42:12] <VanReyes> They are string
[05:42:23] <taplar> variable.split('-')
[05:42:53] <VanReyes> split then create variable?
[05:43:02] <taplar> it's an option
[05:43:13] <VanReyes> The other option?
[05:44:59] <taplar> that just means others may know a better way
[05:45:37] <VanReyes> After spliting?
[05:45:59] <VanReyes> I think after spliting is will still after other strings
[05:46:06] <VanReyes> affect*
[05:49:59] <Bjerre> taplar, is it not possible to do an if where it will look for the string which contains only 7 numbers, and if so > add a zero after the year 2xxx-
[05:50:49] <Bjerre> I mean loop
[05:51:07] <taplar> VanReyes: example of option http://jsfiddle.net/ysgcLcwb/
[05:52:05] <Bjerre> split T? what does that do
[05:52:34] <taplar> the iso date string returned separates the date and time with a 'T'
[05:52:44] <taplar> i'm getting rid of the time
[05:53:07] <notchris> Use Moment
[05:53:21] <notchris> There’s no other way to do time anymore
[05:53:27] <Bjerre> oh I see
[05:54:00] <Cork> so you just want to make sure the last digit section is -xx?
[05:54:42] <Cork> if yes, then all you need is .replace(/(-)([0-9])$/, '$10$2')
[05:55:08] <taplar> ^there's your other options, :)
[05:55:11] <Cork> js> print("here")
[05:55:14] <b-ot> Cork: here
[05:55:30] <Cork> js> print("2015-10-2".replace(/(-)([0-9])$/, '$10$2'))
[05:55:36] <b-ot> Cork: 2015-10-02
[05:55:37] <Cork> js> print("2015-10-12".replace(/(-)([0-9])$/, '$10$2'))
[05:55:41] <b-ot> Cork: 2015-10-12
[05:56:32] <Cork> if you want to handle the months too it gets a little more complicated but not much
[05:56:51] <Cork> js> print("2015-5-12".replace(/(-)([0-9])($|-)/g, '$10$2'))
[05:56:54] <b-ot> Cork: 2015-0512
[05:56:56] <Cork> opps
[05:57:04] <Cork> js> print("2015-5-12".replace(/(-)([0-9])($|-)/g, '$10$2$3'))
[05:57:07] <b-ot> Cork: 2015-05-12
[05:57:51] <Bjerre> Cork is mental
[05:57:53] <Bjerre> in a good way
[05:57:57] <Cork> lol
[05:58:13] <taplar> just let him play with his bot
[05:58:16] <Cork> you should have seen the regex things i've written over the years
[05:58:18] <Bjerre> ye
[05:58:37] <Bjerre> is it matrix Cork ? :D
[05:58:45] <taplar> js> print("I love Cork")
[05:58:50] <b-ot> taplar: I love Cork
[05:58:55] <taplar> that's sweet bot
[05:59:53] <bungbangbong> hello I'm searching for inspiration on how to set up my editor
[05:59:58] <Cork> i was shown a regex for parsing email headers though... never been that insane :)
[06:00:04] <bungbangbong> can one of you post a screenshot of yours thanks
[06:00:11] <taplar> huh?
[06:00:17] <Bjerre> any idea on how to bind arrow keys so they act like the two buttons (.back and .forwards)? http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/51/
[06:00:43] <taplar> bungbangbong: what kind of editor are you talking about?
[06:00:44] <Cork> Bjerre: bind $(document).on('keydown'. function() {})
[06:00:58] <Cork> Bjerre: and then check the event for keyCode
[06:01:15] <bungbangbong> taplar: code editor what else :P
[06:01:28] <taplar> bungbangbong: online, offline.... ?
[06:01:41] <bungbangbong> just searching for look and feel inspiration
[06:02:06] <taplar> professionally i use intellij, or sublime text 2
[06:02:12] <taplar> for offline
[06:02:38] <taplar> online, non-professionally, i use an editor i threw together: github.com/taplar/editor

[06:04:21] <Bjerre> Cork: didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/52/ what am I doing wrong?
[06:04:47] <Cork> you forgot to define e
[06:05:00] <arthurvr> bungbangbong: taplar: so you’re just searching for screenshots of code editors lol?
[06:05:02] <Bjerre> function(e)?
[06:05:08] <Cork> yup
[06:05:19] <taplar> that's what he's after it seems
[06:05:26] <bungbangbong> yes
[06:05:34] <Bjerre> didn't help Cork
[06:05:46] <Bjerre> bungbangbong: I would recommend brackets
[06:06:01] <Bjerre> there are some extensions as well
[06:06:04] <Bjerre> and live preview
[06:06:18] <bungbangbong> I know what editor to use i just want screenshots of how your personal one looks and feels like for inspiration
[06:06:26] <arthurvr> okay so that’s a kinda strange request but happy to post one lol
[06:06:32] <Bjerre> hehe
[06:06:53] <Cork> Bjerre: you forgot the comma
[06:07:02] <Cork> $(document).on('keydown' function (){ <--
[06:07:10] <Cork> should be $(document).on('keydown', function (e){
[06:07:31] <Cork> (and check your browser console)
[06:07:37] <VanReyes> Hey I'm back
[06:07:40] <VanReyes> It's not working
[06:07:45] <VanReyes> The date
[06:07:58] <Cork> what date isn't working?
[06:08:03] <VanReyes> Actually it's not a date
[06:08:07] <VanReyes> it's string only
[06:08:24] <Cork> VanReyes: did you see the regex solution i showed?
[06:08:45] <SuperTyp> sorry for this question but I just couldn't find it in the jQM page...how is the menu called with the 3 horizontal stripes as button?
[06:08:46] <VanReyes> When I change 1 to 01, 11 change also to 0101
[06:08:50] <bungbangbong> I know sorry for stange request
[06:09:13] <Cork> VanReyes: did you see the regex solution i showed? <--
[06:09:24] <Cork> it should solve that problem for you
[06:09:27] <VanReyes> I've tried it. Also, you've sent a lot
[06:09:32] <VanReyes> which one exactly is correct?
[06:09:38] <Cork> "2015-5-12".replace(/(-)([0-9])($|-)/g, '$10$2$3')
[06:09:47] <Cork> should handle months and days
[06:09:52] <Bjerre> awesome, mistake by me Cork
[06:09:58] <Bjerre> thanks for help
[06:10:02] <Cork> np
[06:10:46] <Cork> VanReyes: but read the js> and output lines
[06:10:50] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:10:58] <Cork> it is different versions depending on what you want to have as a result
[06:11:59] <VanReyes> The date is dynamic and it's in a variable. Is this correct?
[06:11:59] <VanReyes> var word.replace(/(-)([0-9])($|-)/g, '$10$2$3')
[06:12:06] <Cork> yes
[06:12:10] <Cork> except for var
[06:12:12] <Bjerre> Cork: how can I locate the syntax errors from the javascript console in chrome?
[06:12:37] <VanReyes> I'm using str_replace, is it different from js?
[06:12:37] <taplar> bungbangbong: http://tinypic.com/r/2a64fhw/8
[06:12:51] <Cork> Bjerre: Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list .../:230
[06:13:01] <Cork> it states it in the console
[06:13:12] <Bjerre> :230?
[06:13:16] <Cork> VanReyes: isn't that php
[06:13:22] <Cork> Bjerre: yes as in line 230
[06:13:32] <Cork> Bjerre: the js is ran inline in jsfiddle
[06:13:43] <Bjerre> hmm ok
[06:13:51] <Bjerre> so I need to count html > css and then js?
[06:13:56] <Cork> so depending on how much css you have its offset changes
[06:14:01] <Cork> yes
[06:14:09] <Bjerre> ok brb a couple of hours
[06:14:15] <Cork> right click the display section and view frame source
[06:14:18] <Bjerre> :)
[06:14:28] <Cork> then scroll down to 230 and you will find where it comes from
[06:15:08] <Bjerre> aah awesome
[06:15:13] <Bjerre> best tips ever
[06:15:33] <SuperTyp> panels, its panels guys!
[06:15:33] <Cork> note that won't work if you have clicked run
[06:15:42] <Cork> cause then it is evaluated html, not source
[06:16:26] <VanReyes> at cork, but it is php variable. The date string is inside php varialb
[06:16:43] <Cork> uh... why are you asking in jquery about php code?
[06:16:49] <Cork> => ##php
[06:17:14] <VanReyes> I can't find solution on php that why I tried in j/jquery
[06:17:26] <VanReyes> can't join ##php
[06:17:32] <VanReyes> only invite
[06:17:33] <Cork> you need to register your nick
[06:17:43] <Cork> /ns help register
[06:19:20] <Bjerre> any syntax errors Cork http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/53/?

[06:19:32] <Bjerre> second link :)
[06:20:04] <Cork> have you tried it?
[06:20:30] <Bjerre> ye I had a lot of errors at first but for some how they disappeared
[06:20:45] <VanReyes> @cork, still can't. Do you have any idea about this in php? Just now. If it's okay
[06:20:52] <Bjerre> Perhaps need to restart browser, don't know why.
[06:21:17] <Cork> VanReyes: you would have to use the regex replace function
[06:21:37] <Uhkis> Bjerre: jshint button on top of the page
[06:21:43] <Cork> VanReyes: http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php
[06:21:45] <VanReyes> Okay thanks
[06:22:01] <Cork> but that is the first and last support of php i will give in this channel, it is offtopic
[06:22:13] <R13ose> Uhkis: any thoughts on my question?
[06:23:11] <VanReyes> Okay, thanks cork. More power :)
[06:24:20] <hellyeah> jey
[06:24:51] <Uhkis> R13ose: api key is bound to your google account
[06:25:12] <Bjerre> Cork: that was a terrific little button I have to say
[06:25:13] <hellyeah> jqgrid does not depend techonology you use right php or asp.net
[06:27:02] <R13ose> Uhkis: meaning I have to ask my friend to do that for his youtube channel?
[06:28:14] <Uhkis> doesnt matter whose key it is
[06:34:31] <walabe> can someone help me figure out why this http://www.onextrapixel.com/examples/interactive-background/ doesn't work on my chrome???
[06:34:50] <walabe> I've been having issues with things like this here and there. Trying to pinpoint the issue
[06:35:27] <taplar> walabe: your console has an error
[06:35:32] <workerbeetwo> How to check the format of a string? e.g. it is expected to be 6-7-digits then "-" and 2-digits again.
[06:35:45] <walabe> what do you mean taplar
[06:35:51] <Cork> workerbeetwo: regex
[06:36:02] <taplar> right click the page, inspect elements, switch to the console tab
[06:36:35] <Cork> js> print(/^[0-9]{6,7}-[0-9]$/.test("123456-5"))
[06:36:38] <b-ot> Cork: true
[06:36:41] <Cork> js> print(/^[0-9]{6,7}-[0-9]$/.test("123456-54"))
[06:36:45] <b-ot> Cork: false
[06:36:55] <walabe> Oh right
[06:37:50] <walabe> It says "blocked by client" why would that be
[06:38:17] <walabe> No that's not it, my site doesn't have that
[06:39:54] <taplar> actually what i'm seeing is not an erro, but a warning: 08:38:07.352 "Received message of type object from http://platform.twitter.com, expected a string"1 all.js:64:238
[06:40:09] <walabe> No this site is not mine
[06:40:17] <walabe> It's the plugin / jquery I'm talking about
[06:40:31] <walabe> Is the thing working for you? e.g. moving paralax image
[06:40:50] <taplar> hold on
[06:42:16] <taplar> the image is doing some little panning animation in my chrome
[06:42:39] <walabe> yes, that's what it's suppose to do. But it doesn't do that for me, doesn't move at all
[06:42:52] <taplar> well your weird, :P
[06:43:13] <walabe> :( I really need to fix the issue, any ideas on what to do to find whats going on
[06:44:45] <taplar> what version of chrome are you on?
[06:44:51] <walabe> latest one
[06:45:26] <Ulrike> Do you have JavaScript enabled or whateves?
[06:45:52] <walabe> Yes most javascript works. But hold on I'll double check
[06:47:46] <walabe> Yeah everything is enabled
[06:51:20] <Ice_Strike> Is there alternative way of find() ?
[06:51:22] <Ice_Strike> For example
[06:51:29] <Ice_Strike> $(".panel-bit-wrapper").click(function () { var panel = $(this).closest(".panel-bit-section"); $(panel).find(".panel-content").slideToggle(); });
[06:52:21] <Ice_Strike> It mean use .panel-content in the .panel-bit-section block
[06:53:02] <Cork> what exactly do you mean?
[06:53:03] <Ulrike> I'm not sure, walabe, the site you linked to doesn't even work for me. The image just aimlessly shakes and stuff and I'm assuming that's not supposed to be how it functions.
[06:53:23] <Cork> Ice_Strike: what is the dom structure?
[06:53:46] <walabe> ulrike well it's suppose to move with the cursor. ahh geez guess I'll find another plugin
[06:53:58] <walabe> I'm going to poke my eyeballs out
[06:54:11] <Ice_Strike> Cork I will pastebin
[06:54:13] <Ulrike> That explains why it isn't working for me lol
[06:54:18] <Ulrike> Because I'm on my cell
[06:55:16] <Ice_Strike> Cork http://jsbin.com/jolububuzi/1/edit?js
[06:55:24] <Ice_Strike> It does work though.
[06:55:37] <Ice_Strike> I am wondering if there is alternative of find()
[06:55:53] <Cork> O_o
[06:56:05] <Cork> Ice_Strike: don't use jsbin it loses changes all the time
[06:56:09] <Cork> like it just did for you
[06:56:23] <Cork> there isn't a single line of jquery in that bin
[06:56:33] <Cork> use jsfiddle
[06:56:36] <Ice_Strike> ok
[07:00:38] <Ice_Strike> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/hkrLt0xj/
[07:00:49] <Ice_Strike> Click on the "Here's the legal bit"
[07:09:46] <walabe> Can someone suggest why my 360 spinner jquery thing is sooo slow? anything I can do to make it rotate smoothly without lag?  http://chronox.netai.net/  scroll down to watch with 360*
[07:11:01] <Ice_Strike> Cork Did you see?
[07:11:23] <Cork> oh, sorry
[07:13:37] <Cork> Ice_Strike: http://jsfiddle.net/hkrLt0xj/1/ ?
[07:15:33] <taplar> walabe: have you tried changing scrollThreshold to be lower than 50px?
[07:15:41] <Ice_Strike> Cork I think that won't work because I will have mulitple .panel-bit-wrapper in a package
[07:15:44] <Ice_Strike> in a page*
[07:16:00] <Ice_Strike> Each .panel-bit-wrapper will have .panel-content
[07:16:05] <Cork> Ice_Strike: and they need to talk cross wrappers?
[07:16:05] <walabe> let me check
[07:17:04] <Ice_Strike> http://jsfiddle.net/hkrLt0xj/2/
[07:17:08] <Ice_Strike> Oh I think it does work
[07:17:23] <Bjerre> that is cool Ice_Strike
[07:17:43] <Bjerre> you should prevent it from being clicked multiple times during the duration though
[07:17:43] <Ice_Strike> What is siblings?
[07:17:55] <Bjerre> during fade"
[07:18:06] <Cork> ?api siblings
[07:18:06] <b-ot> Cork: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:18:15] <Lope> I'm trying to grab all of the li elements, but I'm only getting the first one? $('div#foo ol li')
[07:18:33] <walabe> taplar I just changed it lower and it did nothing, the notes say that's for touch devices. It seems when I am actually going from frame to frame, it's slow doing that as well.
[07:18:38] <Ice_Strike> Thanks Cork
[07:18:43] <Cork> Lope: you should get all of them
[07:18:52] <Cork> Lope: also no tag name infront of ids
[07:18:59] <Ice_Strike> ;)
[07:19:22] <Lope> Cork, oh, thanks.

[08:40:45] <Dzejmskrokan> Will inserting the new div under with class hover help me? the Flexslider won't remove it?
[08:41:21] <Zzaichik> You'll have to add it with jQuery/JavaScript
[08:43:00] <Dzejmskrokan> Damn I'm still beginner with this stuff
[08:45:31] <Dzejmskrokan> Zzaichik:
[08:45:46] <Dzejmskrokan> Ups sorry didn't want to type that

[08:59:11] <alex______> Hi all.. I have one search field that get submitted when user press return. What I need to do is to include whatevere the user types within speech quotes, to search the exact word. I am trying to add the speech quotes after the form is submitted, but I struggle to find a way to keep submitting the form after I use the e.preventDefault()
[08:59:39] <alex______> I detect the submit with $(‘#form’).submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }
[09:00:12] <alex______> and then I add the speechquotes to the input value, but not sure how to use jquery to submit the newly value
[09:05:36] <Zzaichik> .submit() ?
[09:09:30] <taplar> short answer, you'll probably want to conditionally prevent default, only if you have not validated your input yet

[10:02:52] <Razerglass> how do i pull the value of a input field from my html?
[10:03:06] <Falbala> .val
[10:03:06] <taplar> $(selector).val()
[10:03:24] <Razerglass> <input id="inputBox" type="text"></input>     $('inputbox').value
[10:03:28] <Razerglass> doesnt seem to work for me
[10:03:42] <taplar> $('#inputBox').val()
[10:03:55] <Falbala> taplar was faster
[10:04:50] <Razerglass> taplar my console log now gives me "global.js:16 jQuery.fn.extend.val(value)"  instead of the value of my input text
[10:05:08] <pauled> Hi, do you how to use css content to show content from element?
[10:05:16] <taplar> what's the statement your using?
[10:05:27] <Razerglass> console.log($('#inputBox').val);
[10:05:38] <taplar> your missing the val parenthesies
[10:05:52] <taplar> it's a function
[10:05:53] <Razerglass> taplar
[10:05:54] <Razerglass> got it thank you
[10:05:59] <Razerglass> :D
[10:06:17] <taplar> pauled: can you elaborate?
[10:13:32] <pauled> taplar: yes, 3 minutes I will make fiddle
[10:20:00] <gambl0re> is there a way to make handlebar files (.hbs) to be color coded instead of an all white text?
[10:24:43] <apipkin> I am creating a plugin with custom events. I want to have the default callback function for a selected event to be prevented if the implementation decides the selected value is not valid by subscribing to the selected event. Can anyone here help direct me to a blog post that talks about such a thing?
[10:26:50] <taplar> apipkin: so, in the event that a custom event finds an invalid value, you want to prevent certain other standard events?
[10:28:36] <apipkin> @taplar Basically. I have a list of items, that when one is selected, it will update an internal selectedIndex (and various other things). But if the implementer decides such a selected item is invalid, i would like it to not update the internal constructs
[10:29:30] <apipkin> like $(list).on('selected', function (e, item) { if item.index % 2  e.preventDefault(); } );   or something like that
[10:31:06] <pauled> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/9kobma70/
[10:31:47] <pauled> taplar: I want to display strong and span element in a small popup hint when I mouse hover
[10:33:26] <apipkin> @pauled: node.html() will return the innerHTML of the node
[10:34:11] <apipkin> pauled: you could have something like  $('.tooltip').html(selectedNode.html()).show();
[10:35:45] <taplar> pauled: yeah, look into using a tooltip http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[10:36:19] <pauled> thanks, I was looking if there is not a css solution http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/
[10:38:41] <apipkin> pauled: Not a css only solution. Pseudo elements content can be set via css, but it wouldn't be able to support inner node constructs the way you are seeking. You could set a tooltip in the string like data-tooltip="Look at this!"  and then have the css do [data-tooltip]:hover:before { content: attr('data-tooltip'); position: absolute; } but nothing really
[10:38:41] <apipkin> more than string values
[10:39:18] <apipkin> s/the string/the node
[10:41:29] <pauled> I see. But in the previous link, I see this example @footnote {content: pending(footnotes);}
[10:41:48] <pauled> what are footnotes? an element?
[10:43:11] <pauled> another example I see is; p.note { content: endnote; }
[10:45:24] <pauled> apipkin: currently I am trying to transform this http://en.lichess.org/tv/classical into this http://i.imgur.com/l8Mo2Xu.png with an userscript
[10:46:32] <pauled> trying to reuse what the site provide
[10:47:22] <amtrivedi> Hello,
[10:47:22] <amtrivedi> I have a html page which contains a form. Now I want that I can access this form from some other page.
[10:47:22] <amtrivedi> On the other page I want to provide a button clicking on which displays the original form as a popup on this page itself.
[10:47:53] <amtrivedi> I know I have to use jquery in this but I 'm not entirely sure how to implement it.
[10:48:24] <taplar> amtrivedi: i would suggest to retrieve the secondary page with the form in ajax, and display it on the first page in a modal
[10:48:46] <taplar> or open to the second page with an ifram in a modal
[10:48:50] <taplar> iframe
[10:49:31] <amtrivedi> taplar: Could you elaborate a bit?
[10:49:53] <taplar> is the page with the form a fully formed page?   or are you trying to do some sort of templating of your site?
[10:50:49] <amtrivedi> No, its fully formed.
[10:51:04] <amtrivedi> I just need to render it as a popup form.
[10:51:14] <amtrivedi> On a separate page, by means of a button click.
[10:51:37] <apipkin> pauled: #css may be a better room. But what you are trying to implement with CSS only may not have any or very limited browser support. Although this is CSS3 specs, the browsers have to implement this. Along side of that, this spec says nested pseudos and multiple psuedos of the same type are valid, but chrome firefox and safari do not have this implemented
[10:51:37] <apipkin> http://jsbin.com/yolote/1/edit?html,css,output
[10:51:50] <taplar> what should happen when they submit that form?
[10:52:35] <amtrivedi> taplar: Nothing new, the function it serves right now would be served when it is filled via a popup.
[10:52:50] <amtrivedi> taplar: The aim of doing is making the data entry process smoother.
[10:53:08] <taplar> i mean, should the popup close and the user remain on the original page, or should they be transfered to another page?
[10:53:45] <amtrivedi> taplar: Yeah, when the user hits submit they should remain on the original page, which rendered the popup.
[10:54:09] <amtrivedi> taplar: Because this other template is a form in itself.
[10:54:18] <taplar> ok, yeah, ajax sounds like the way to go here
[10:54:39] <amtrivedi> You may say that the original form is its sub form.
[10:55:20] <taplar> i would strip that form page down to the bare essentials for display, when you want to use it, retrieve that page with ajax and display it in a modal.  when the user 'submits' that form, process it with ajax and close the modal when your done
[10:56:04] <amtrivedi> taplar: That is exactly what I am trying to do :)
[10:56:18] <taplar> k, how familiar are you with modals and ajax?
[10:56:19] <amtrivedi> taplar: The problem is that I have little knowledge of AJAX
[10:56:34] <taplar> ?api ajax
[10:56:34] <b-ot> taplar: No matches.
[10:56:44] <taplar> ?api $.ajax
[10:56:44] <b-ot> taplar: No matches.
[10:56:49] <taplar> ?api $.get
[10:56:49] <b-ot> taplar: No matches.
[10:56:54] <taplar> dang  it!  lol
[10:56:57] <taplar> hold on
[10:57:21] <amtrivedi> taplar: I have no experience with AJAX and modal.
[10:57:31] <amtrivedi> Currently, I am reading about it.
[10:57:42] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:58:31] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[10:59:07] <taplar> i'd suggest working on getting a dialog to open and close first in prep.  and then you can look into the ajax to load it and process
[11:00:05] <amtrivedi> Yeah, sound good :)
[11:00:40] <amtrivedi> One more thing, for gathering the essentials of the original form I should create a new HTML containing only the necessary part and load them via AJAX.
[11:00:44] <amtrivedi> Right?
[11:01:12] <taplar> yep, no need for the whole <html>......</html> structure, just your <form> part
[11:01:35] <taplar> your original document your going to display in will have all that outer structure already
[11:02:27] <amtrivedi> taplar: yeah, right. Thanks a lot :)
[11:02:35] <taplar> np, hope it helps
[11:03:04] <amtrivedi> :)
[11:13:47] <apipkin> Is it possible to get the triggered event from a node.trigger() call?
[11:14:03] <taplar> the event object?
[11:14:20] <apipkin> Correct. The one that is passed to listeners
[11:14:41] <taplar> .on('event', function(eventObject){});
[11:16:19] <csd_`> How can I append to a table such that if the columns changed in the future, that my code would be able to adapt automatically (i.e. keying off a class name or id ) ?
[11:16:56] <taplar> bind your event handlers to the table element as delegates
[11:16:58] <apipkin> taplar: but not able to get it outside of the callback? like  triggeredEvent = node.trigger('click') ?
[11:17:00] <taplar> ?api delegates
[11:17:00] <b-ot> taplar: No matches.
[11:17:08] <taplar> ?jquery delegates
[11:17:20] <csd_`> taplar: directed to me?
[11:17:22] <taplar> the bot hates me
[11:17:30] <apipkin> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:17:41] <taplar> csd_`: ^ yep
[11:17:52] <taplar> ?api delegate
[11:17:52] <b-ot> taplar: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:17:59] <taplar> ah, non plural
[11:18:07] <apipkin> :)
[11:20:09] <csd_`> taplar: so every element in a column would share the same class?
[11:20:34] <taplar> sure
[11:20:46] <csd_`> is there a better way?
[11:21:23] <taplar> i would say that is the preferred way, if the contents of the table can change dynamically
[11:21:35] <csd_`> nah, just futureproofing
[11:21:58] <taplar> oh, well, no comment, :D
[11:23:40] <pauled> apipkin: I found somewhat tooltips http://jsfiddle.net/9kobma70/3/ but I can't get it works with both element (span and strong)
[11:25:12] <apipkin> pauled: any way to wrap the children in a single element?
[11:26:46] <pauled> apipkin: I try without JS, but ultimately I will make with if I find no way in CSS only
[11:28:36] <scrandaddy> Hey there. Is there a way to subscribe to the resize event on a by element basis instead of on window?
[11:30:02] <apipkin> pauled: i was thinking like this. http://jsbin.com/qufana/1/edit?html,css,output
[11:32:34] <pauled> nice :)
[11:36:54] <acidjazz> ive got an odd JS question.. ive got something like obj.red1 obj.red2 obj.red3
[11:37:32] <acidjazz> and im looping through 1-3 to access them, is it possibel to concatenate two variable names to get the output of one?
[11:38:25] <taplar> acidjazz: sure
[11:39:00] <taplar> acidjazz: or you could use a pattern selector of $('[class^="red"])
[11:42:01] <apipkin> acidjazz: as long as the concatenation is a valid selector, you'll get back what you want. ('.red' + num) would be valid. Though I agree with taplar that doing something like $('[class^="red"]) may be more idea because that is a single look up to capture all the nodes with a classname beginning with "red", then you could find them by index (if they are in
[11:42:01] <apipkin> order)
[11:43:21] <apipkin> So that would be $('[class^="red"]')[num - 1]; // node at index of `num`. minus one if `num` is 1 based and not zero based
[11:43:51] <acidjazz> im not talkin jquery selectors, im talking JS
[11:44:12] <apipkin> acidjazz: what browsers?
[11:45:16] <taplar> ok, i think i was confused.  do you mean var obj = { red1: '', red2: '', red3: '' } ?
[11:45:45] <apipkin> document.querySelectorAll('[class^="red"]'); would still give you a NodeList. If you are wanting to support browsers that do not support document.querySelector, you will end up writing much of what sizzle has done under the hood.
[11:46:01] <apipkin> taplar: Ooops... :P
[11:46:17] <apipkin> obj['red' + num]
[11:46:23] <taplar> ^
[11:46:28] <acidjazz> apipkin: thanks perfect
[11:46:41] <acidjazz> taplar: yes thanks
[11:49:00] <taplar> i guess scrandaddy left?
[11:49:52] <apipkin> taplar: This seems to be doing what I need it to do, but do you know of a cleaner/better way? https://gist.github.com/apipkin/1c9042940b9d7a4dfdce
[11:50:23] <taplar> apipkin: what part are you concerned about?
[11:50:34] <apipkin> line #37
[11:50:46] <apipkin> It seems the only way to get the triggered event is within a callback
[11:51:12] <apipkin> When really, I just need it passed to the _after method
[11:51:53] <taplar> in an event handler, e passed in is the event object.  if your just after the element that the event originated on you can just reference $(this)
[11:52:12] <taplar> works for direct binds and delegates
[11:53:18] <apipkin> no, I need to see if the event was prevented by the implementer. If they did, I need to not do the stuff inside of _after*
[11:53:18] <taplar> i think you want prevent propagation
[11:53:33] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[11:53:48] <taplar> if you stop the propagation it won't be handled by any other event handler
[11:54:00] <taplar> it stops bubbling
[11:54:27] <apipkin> But it still fires in order of binding, correct? Internal binds are earlier than external binds
[11:54:43] <taplar> true
[11:54:58] <apipkin> That's where the @#$! is coming from :)
[11:54:59] <taplar> well
[11:55:09] <taplar> depends on when they executed your binding
[11:55:14] <taplar> which could be variable
[11:55:29] <apipkin> Very true
[11:55:36] <taplar> personally not sure how you would prevent future bindings
[11:55:47] <apipkin> I'm allowing them to do $node.plugin().on('selected', fn)
[11:55:52] <taplar> i'd say at that point it's the users error, :P
[11:56:13] <apipkin> Haha "What do you mean you want to cancel this??!?"
[11:58:24] <_biff> hi
[11:58:41] <taplar> evening
[11:58:51] <taplar> offseting for variable timezone
[11:58:57] <_biff> why im getting internal server error response using jquery fielupload...at this line when the script wants to add a new form after upload
[11:59:08] <_biff> var form=$('<form></form>');
[11:59:13] <_biff>  form.appendTo('body');
[11:59:23] <_biff> any suggestion?
[12:00:00] <_biff> not after instead before...
[12:02:25] <taplar> those lines should not cause an internal server error.  that type of response is typically from something going wrong on the back end
[12:02:37] <taplar> the request returned an error 500
[12:03:49] <_biff> taplar but file uploaded
[12:03:58] <_biff> hm...
[12:05:15] <_biff> taplar if i comment out the whole function content , of course there wont be uploading...but error 500 also getting
[12:05:46] <_biff> if i comment the php function
[12:06:04] <_biff> and php function found.....if i mispell the function name im getting not found error
[12:06:15] <taplar> right click on the page, inspect an element and switch to the network tab.  repeat whatever your doing and you should see in there what is returning the 500
[12:06:48] <_biff> taplar thats what im watching...
[12:06:56] <_biff> status is 500 one of the line
[12:08:53] <taplar> yeah, so there is an error with that request your making to the back end
[12:09:17] <_biff> so not with the function...
[12:09:25] <taplar> the back end function your calling, do you have it surrounded in a try catch?
[12:10:29] <taplar> if not, try doing: try { /* whatever logic you have right now */ } catch ( Exception $e) { error_log($e->getMessage() ); }
[12:10:36] <taplar> and check your error log file to see what's going on
[12:11:10] <_biff> taplar but what should be wrong if there is nothing in that function (if i comment out)
[12:11:50] <_biff> im also getting error 500
[12:12:27] <Mooniac> looking for a complete example for a slider. In the event, it's supposed to send the value to a URL with the value as parameter, RESTful API, Get method, and receive the image and display the image. Googled and can't find anything. Thanks.
[12:16:03] <taplar> _biff: if your function has no content and your still geting a 500.  that would be weird.  that would seem to indicate that either your request input is in some form that the server cannot handle, but that to me would seem to be a 400, not a 500.  alternatively, possibly it might be complaining if it is expecting you to return something and is returning nothing as a response
[12:16:58] <taplar> _biff: you might try poking around in ##php and see what those cats have to say about it
[12:19:59] <amtrivedi> taplar: Hi, I was able to create and close a dialog box successfully and link it to that button of mine that I wanted to.
[12:20:14] <taplar> amtrivedi: cool
[12:20:56] <amtrivedi> taplar: Now, the problem for me is how to connect this button to the HTMl and my python backend.
[12:22:08] <amtrivedi> I know I'll have to write some code in the backend to process AJAX request.
[12:22:16] <k-joseph> hi guys, i understand that css uses id to unify html elements, however am doing some strong dynamic page development and i have used samilar ids for different element types, forexample same id for textarea and select element and so am trying to access their properties from jquery like; $("textarea #" + uuid).text(); and $jq("select #" + uuid) which is not yet working, what works out in this case
[12:22:17] <taplar> amtrivedi: alright, so now take a look at the open callback http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[12:23:24] <taplar> amtrivedi: you can bind a handler to the open callback to perform when it is opened, so that you retrieve and build the dialog when that executes
[12:24:02] <taplar> k-joseph: if you want to group elements in a common identifier, that is typically the use of a class
[12:24:23] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, in this callback how do I pass the HTMl that I want to inject?
[12:24:36] <taplar> <htmlelement id="something-unique" class="names"></htmlelement>
[12:25:08] <taplar> k-joseph: then to select all the elements with that class, $('.names')
[12:25:10] <k-joseph> taplar: sure, i know that however i need some way of still unifying several items which i still obtain dynamically
[12:25:50] <taplar> k-joseph: guess i'm not understanding entirely.  can you elaborate?
[12:26:30] <taplar> amtrivedi: that would be when you use ajax to retrieve it
[12:26:44] <k-joseph> taplar: i thought the id selector takes note of the element type or localName
[12:27:14] <taplar> k-joseph: a selector can use the id alone (and should) to find the element
[12:27:21] <taplar> it's an id, it is unique to the page
[12:27:36] <taplar> the dom will not allow you to have multiple elements with the same id
[12:27:48] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, then what functionality does this callback serves exactly, I mean we already have the dialog box working.
[12:28:16] <k-joseph> taplar: yes,   how about defining elementtype to narrow down the search for the element and thereby appending element id!
[12:29:18] <taplar> k-joseph: what do you mean defining element tpe?
[12:29:21] <taplar> ^type
[12:29:55] <k-joseph> taplar: something like $('input #id')
[12:30:00] <taplar> amtrivedi: that callback fires when the dialog opens.  which would be the point at which you would want to initialize the contents of it, provided it was not already loaded prior
[12:30:13] <taplar> k-joseph: input in that case is not necessary
[12:30:52] <taplar> k-joseph: only one element can have the id="id"
[12:30:57] <k-joseph> taplar: but i have been using that several times even with out denining an id forexample when looping through items
[12:31:04] <k-joseph> taplar: alright
[12:31:17] <k-joseph> taplar: let me think of another logic to work out
[12:31:37] <notchris> If my string is: 12 Test Dr, Hartford, CT 06033, USA    how do I grab just the “CT”
[12:31:50] <taplar> oh lord, lol
[12:32:23] <amtrivedi> taplar: Oh, is it a sort of a confirmation, that the dialog has opened?
[12:32:45] <taplar> notchris: maybe split on comma, take the last -1 element and then split that by space and take the first element?
[12:33:25] <notchris> taplar: Ah good plan
[12:33:51] <taplar> amtrivedi: dialog can be used for anything.  essentially it's a popup that can usually be closed with an X at the top right.
[12:35:01] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, but I think I don't need this callback in what I want to do, is it something that we ought to do?
[12:35:58] <taplar> amtrivedi: i mentioned the use of that callback as a possible place to perform your ajax call to retrieve the contents of your html page that has the form you want to display.
[12:36:13] <taplar> amtrivedi: as you said you wanted it in another file
[12:36:47] <amtrivedi> taplar: Oh, you mean that I'll write the corresponding AJAX inside this open callback?
[12:37:04] <taplar> amtrivedi: bingo
[12:38:24] <amtrivedi> taplar:
[12:38:25] <amtrivedi> $( ".selector" ).dialog({
[12:38:25] <amtrivedi>   open: $.ajax({});
[12:38:25] <amtrivedi> });
[12:38:31] <amtrivedi> Somethink like this?
[12:38:44] <taplar> open: function() { $.ajax({}); }
[12:39:10] <amtrivedi> Oh yeah, right!
[12:39:12] <taplar> or if you want to break it up
[12:39:39] <taplar> var retrieveForm = function(){ $.ajax({}); }  and then later  open: retrieveForm
[12:40:26] <amtrivedi> Okay, thanks, On it.
[12:40:54] <taplar> the benifit being if you come back later and you see " open: retrieveFormThatCreatesUsers" then it's a bit more readable to what the h*** is going on, :D
[12:41:04] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I have a data attribute with integers.  Is there another way besides .filter() that I can select the elements whose data-attribute are outside of a range?
[12:41:40] <MarcGuay> Example, 3 divs with data-foo 1,2,3 and I want to select elements with data-foo greater than 1 and less than 3.
[12:41:45] <taplar> MarcGuay: sure, but probably not a better way
[12:41:49] <amtrivedi> taplar: yaa, definitely.
[12:42:43] <MarcGuay> taplar: Ok, thanks
[12:47:43] <Wes-_> Is there a way to tell jquery to not trap exceptions in event handlers?
[12:47:59] <Wes-_> s/trap/swallow/
[12:48:02] <taplar> Wes-_: globally?
[12:48:10] <Wes-_> taplar: ideally, yes
[12:48:55] <taplar> not that i'm aware of.  and not sure that it could enforce it.  you can bind event handlers without jquery
[12:50:53] <Wes-_> taplar: yeah - my issues stem from places where jquery was used to bind events, they get swallowed instead of hitting our usual untrapped exception handler.....which means library code built without jquery in mind that throws, expecting diagnostics to hit window.onerror just mysteriously "doesn't work".  Very puzzling.
[12:53:17] <taplar> any way, i'm out cats.  have a good evening
[12:53:47] <notchris> Any idea how to select ‘name’ from this array?
[12:53:57] <notchris> http://puu.sh/itUX0/893968040a.png
[12:54:22] <notchris> I get that array when i log “result"
[12:54:35] <notchris> So I tried,  result.html_attributions.name
[12:54:50] <notchris> Oh..
[12:54:53] <notchris> Maybe I want result.name
[12:54:54] <notchris> ?
[12:56:52] <notchris> Yep
[12:56:53] <notchris> my bad
[13:02:09] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm playing around with a new idea and it's starting to look like a bad one.  I have a collection of items with many attributes (size, shape, etc) which would be handy to be able to filter through.  Show me all blue items that are round for example.
[13:02:41] <mmmveggies> blue items generally are a bad idea
[13:04:15] <MarcGuay> So I set up data-attributes on the items to match the attributes and have been playing with filter() to show/hide the matching items.
[13:04:47] <MarcGuay> But now when there are multiple filters getting flipped on and off, the logic of checking them all seems like it would become a crazy-making exercise.
[13:05:01] <MarcGuay> Should I abandon this approach?
[13:05:08] <mmmveggies> what do you mean flipping on and off?
[13:05:48] <mmmveggies> filtering a collection by multiple properties seems like a pretty standard thing to need
[13:05:52] <MarcGuay> mmmveggies: Like when the user is flipping the filters, it seems like I would have to check all of the filter statuses every time one changes.
[13:06:13] <MarcGuay> Or check for the current visibility of an item every time...
[13:06:36] <mmmveggies> unless your collection is massively large, it should only take milliseconds
[13:07:52] <MarcGuay> Say a user says "Show me blue round things".  Great, I hide all things that aren't blue and then hide things that aren't round.  But then if they want to show red things instead of blue, I can't just hide all blue things and show all red things, I have to rerun the round-checking logic as well.
[13:08:44] <mmmveggies> yes I would say you have your FullList, and then every time you remove a filter you go back to the original full list and filter it
[13:08:44] <MarcGuay> It's not the processing time I'm worried about, it's the madness of the code.
[13:09:14] <csd_`> I'm running into problems appending rows to an existing table. I think I'm getting caught in an infinite loop as Chrome basically breaks into tears. Can someone please critique what I might be doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/Va8sV862
[13:09:20] <MarcGuay> mmmveggies: Right...
[13:09:28] <MarcGuay> That might be the thought I was missing.
[13:10:39] <mmmveggies> $('input').on('input', function(e) { myFilteredData = applyFilter(fullData, inputs) });
[13:10:42] <mmmveggies> or something like that
[13:12:42] <mmmveggies> csd_`, are you trying to create elements? $('tr') is a selector, $('<tr/>') creates a new one
[13:13:06] <csd_`> oh, create new ones
[13:14:21] <csd_`> mmmveggies: still goes crazy though with that change made
[13:14:31] <csd_`> its gotta be entering some sort of infinite loop but i dont see how
[13:19:25] <mmmveggies> http://jsfiddle.net/adz1pj9z/ try that csd_`
[13:19:56] <mmmveggies> appendColumns isn't returning anything, but you're using it as if it does
[13:23:35] <gerep> Hi all. I have a select and I want to get the next select available: https://gist.github.com/gerep/41ffc3b4356ee0a31ad3
[13:23:46] <gerep> I can't make this work with closest(), can someone help?
[13:24:03] <gerep> The first select comes with a list and according to what is selected, I'll populate the next select with data
[13:24:15] <apipkin> gerep: are you wanting to be able to get the select from the label?
[13:24:25] <legrandin> is there a way to check whether a dom element exists?
[13:24:27] <gerep> I can't count on the their classes because they are dinamic, they change the _0_ for a random umber
[13:24:34] <gerep> apipkin, what?
[13:25:06] <apipkin> gerep: Oh wait, you are wanting to get from one select to the next select. ?
[13:25:11] <gerep> Yes
[13:25:19] <mmmveggies> legrandin, !!$('selector').length
[13:25:21] <gerep> apipkin, yes, get the id of the next one
[13:25:25] <apipkin> Okay, one sec
[13:26:04] <apipkin> Do you know what the common ancestor is?
[13:26:06] <legrandin> thanks mmmveggies
[13:26:13] <mmmveggies> :D
[13:26:27] <gerep> apipkin, a div="affiliation-addresses"
[13:26:30] <gerep> apipkin, a div class="affiliation-addresses"
[13:26:46] <apipkin> is that known in the app, or will that change?
[13:27:06] <gerep> apipkin, it is know but I'll dynamically add new selects to it
[13:27:27] <gerep> apipkin, so right now it has 2 selects but I can add more and more
[13:28:03] <gerep> apipkin, with a random id (id="merchant[merchant_addresses_attributes][0][city]"] I'll change the [0] for a random number)
[13:28:32] <mmmveggies> you need to use data-attributes
[13:28:34] <gerep> apipkin, when I add a new select it may come like: id="merchant[merchant_addresses_attributes][128973691][city]"
[13:30:18] <gerep> mmmveggies, can you give an exemple?
[13:30:30] <gerep> mmmveggies, I know I can create any kind of data-something
[13:30:45] <gerep> mmmveggies, but it is not clear how I can make them unique and know to my application
[13:31:26] <mmmveggies> <select class="form-control" data-merchant-id="128973691" data-merchant-resolution="city"
[13:31:58] <gerep> mmmveggies, ok and how will I be able to find those?
[13:32:06] <gerep> mmmveggies, dynamically
[13:32:23] <gerep> $("#merchant[merchant_addresses_attributes][0][state]").change()
[13:32:36] <gerep> How will I be able to find the next select element?
[13:33:06] <mmmveggies> $('[data-merchant-id=' + myMerchantId + ']')
[13:34:20] <gerep> mmmveggies, I understand but I don't have the id, it is random and generated by Ruby
[13:34:37] <gerep> mmmveggies, Unless I'm capable of removing that number from the id
[13:35:57] <gerep> merchant[merchant_addresses_attributes][123][city] <- get the 123
[13:36:06] <csd_`> mmmveggies: no dice :-/
[13:36:22] <gerep> and search for merchant[merchant_addresses_attributes][+id+][city]
[13:36:40] <mmmveggies> csd_` I'm confused, problem might be elsewhere
[13:37:10] <csd_`> 'row' is a json object & browser is complaining about calling map on it
[13:37:29] <mmmveggies> you shouldn't be iterating over objects anyway
[13:37:47] <csd_`> what should i do to flatten it?
[13:38:00] <mmmveggies> I'm not sure what your data looks like so I don't know.
[13:38:04] <csd_`> ok
[13:38:13] <csd_`> thanks for looking at it
[13:38:18] <mmmveggies> good luck
[13:40:50] <gambl0re> anybody here use ember?
[13:41:30] <apipkin> gerep: I would do something like http://jsbin.com/segane/1/edit?js,output
[13:42:25] <apipkin> Ideally I wouldn't want to traverse the dom on each look up, so I would parse once to find all, then add them to the array on each time I dynamically add them to the page.
[13:43:04] <gerep> apipkin, thank you so much, I'll adapt your code and try it
[13:43:09] <gerep> really helpfull
[13:43:15] <gerep> *helpful
[13:54:05] <MarcGuay> mmmveggies: You set me on the right path, thanks again.

[15:02:46] <NoiseEee> i think you have to make each el a jquery object
[15:03:10] <NoiseEee> $('mySelector').each(function(i,el) { el = $(el);  //go forth });
[15:57:36] <hydraidm801> $.ajax the success part. Is that part only ran if it is successful? or do I need to write if(data){//do stuff...}
[15:58:15] <mmmveggies> success is a returned response. you'll want to check the status incase it is a 500 or something
[15:58:50] <mmmveggies> that might just be an hxr thing though, idk if ajax throws on 500 and 400
[15:59:40] <hydraidm801> hxr ?
[16:00:08] <mmmveggies> xhr, the plain javascript way of doing ajax

[16:39:25] <rickthuc> anyone familiar with scrollr.js here?
[16:42:55] <theBestNunu> hi, guys. im lokking for help. i need to to a simple slider for a website. i tried BxSlider but i have a problem with it. it doesnt show image controls. i placed image directory inside css folder as instructed and yet it shows text controls instead of image controls. it looks like this: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0c24zvkze1  please help.
[16:44:06] <rickthuc> theBestNunu: you have to specify a custom pager for that http://bxslider.com/examples/thumbnail-pager-1
[16:46:43] <theBestNunu> rickthuc: ty mate. so i need to specify URLs for my slider images twice? in <ul> and in <div> ?
[16:47:55] <theBestNunu> rickthuc: i dont want thumbnails. i just want those graphical control arrows, instead of the text below "next" "stop" etc..
[16:54:56] <Dorf> if i have Object {Mo: "02:30-07:00", Tu: "02:00-18:30”} as the console.log(var) result from var how would i get Mo and Tu from it?
[16:57:30] <hydraidm801> how can I update a variable inside $.ajax() so that it has a global scope? cause when I try to update "var nexturl" inside $.ajax() success function it is undefined elsewhere
[16:58:08] <hydraidm801> I was thinking about having var nexturl as something like $.nexturl = new Object();
[17:18:18] <rickthuc> theBestNunu: show a live example
[17:18:31] <deweydb> anyone know where i can find docs for a really old version of jquery ui
[17:18:44] <deweydb> i'm using 1.6. and i can't update, because i can't update jquery, because it will screw up drupal.
[17:18:46] <theBestNunu> rickthuc: how can i do that? upload file ?
[17:27:33] <deweydb> if i'm running jquery version 1.7. what is the newest version of jquery ui that is compatible?
[18:07:13] <AliG1000> http://jsbin.com/qeyavilejo/edit?html,css,js  Currently, I have to clear the text field before Ican type anything into it.  How can I clear it upon focus() or something similar, but if I don't select anything from the autocomplete and I unfocus, it reverts back (i.e nothing changes)
[19:35:17] <Guest30569> hi guys, i am encountering this issue but could not solve it
[19:35:33] <Guest30569> i am using google chrome inspect element , and it prompts me this error
[19:35:33] <Guest30569> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).mmenu is not a function
[19:36:52] <Guest30569> urms, this is my jquery code
[19:36:52] <Guest30569> https://dpaste.de/Buji
[19:37:15] <Guest30569> i am using bootstrap if it helps
[19:40:05] <Woet> as it says, mmenu is not a function.
[19:40:21] <Woet> so you haven't loaded that library at that point.
[19:40:49] <Guest30569> hmm
[19:42:07] <Guest30569> i believe i did...................
[19:42:14] <Guest30569> i did import the js file.
[19:43:24] <Guest30569> if i change the first line of that jquery to $(function() { instead of jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[19:43:37] <Guest30569> it gives me another error of TypeError: a is undefined from firefbug~
[19:45:58] <jim_j> <a href="http://www.test.com/?test=1&a=20&b=25">Link</a>  how can I update a=20 to a=10 on page load?
[19:47:30] <Woet> jim_j: what are you actually trying to do?
[19:47:40] <daivyk> Guest30569 read this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8996852/load-and-execute-order-of-scripts#answer-8996894 its what Woet is trying to explain, scripts are loaded in the order encountered in the page.
[19:48:06] <jim_j> Woet, I want to be able to change the a= and b= parameter values in my anchor href on page load
[19:48:30] <Woet> jim_j: you mentioned that, and it's a weird thing to do. that's why i'm trying what are you /actually/ trying to do?
[19:48:35] <Guest30569> alright, thanks. :)
[19:48:36] <Woet> s/trying/asking/
[19:48:58] <daivyk> ;)
[19:49:40] <jim_j> woet, well there is html code that is hardcoded and can't be changed manually on the page so I'm writing jquery to change the value of the link based on parameters that are passed unto the page
[19:51:04] <DietDrK> unhardcode them
[19:51:08] <jim_j> so the page is let's say:  http://www.page.com/?test=5&a=10&b=10  and on the page there is an href:  <a href="http://www.test.com/?test=1&a=20&b=25">Link</a> and I want the resulting href to become:  <a href="http://www.test.com/?test=1&a=10&b=10">Link</a>
[19:51:34] <DietDrK> if I'm using noscript, then it just won't work?
[19:53:58] <DietDrK> I googled "changing anchor href with jquery" to find the answer, btw
[19:54:13] <jim_j> ah I got it
[19:54:48] <DietDrK> but really that's a poor way to approach that problem.
[19:58:11] <jim_j> Woet, I figured it out when you asked me what I'm trying to do, thanks
[19:58:28] <jim_j> I read if you ask someone 'why' 5 times they figure it out
[19:58:36] <Woet> jim_j: why why why why why?
[19:58:43] <jim_j> lol
[20:01:55] <Forbidd3n> Not sure if I am asking in the right channel, but I am looking for a way to have a floorplan layout and dynamically create sections with rollover tooltips without using imagemaps
[20:02:54] <DietDrK> SVG +JQuery
[20:03:11] <DietDrK> there's another library that does it better that starts with an R... Raphael.js?
[20:03:37] <Forbidd3n> DietDrK: Raphael.js for me
[20:28:11] <Forbidd3n> DietDrK: any online wizards to slice out svg image?
[20:28:17] <Forbidd3n> then to add tooltips to each slice
[20:59:17] <AliG1000> I'm still trying to figure out this:
[20:59:21] <AliG1000> http://jsbin.com/qeyavilejo/edit?html,css,js  Currently, I have to clear the text field before Ican type anything into it.  How can I clear it upon focus() or something similar, but if I don't select anything from the autocomplete and I unfocus, it reverts back (i.e nothing changes)
[21:21:01] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of an online tool to create polygon points on an svg imagemap?
[21:23:32] <doga> Forbidd3n: just append an element to the svg
[21:23:45] <Forbidd3n> doga: not sure I follow you?
[21:23:54] <doga> to create polygon points?
[21:24:00] <Forbidd3n> It is a floorplan and I need to create sections with classes so I can use tooltips
[21:24:42] <Forbidd3n> doga: something like this - http://jsfiddle.net/eGyWV/
[21:25:03] <doga> Forbidd3n: this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polygon
[21:25:21] <Forbidd3n> how do I append an element to the svg image
[21:25:51] <doga> same as any other append
[21:26:02] <doga> you select the svg and .append a new line...
[21:27:16] <Forbidd3n> doga: what app would I use to do that?
[21:27:21] <doga> however, you have to namespace the createElement, somehting like: var thing = $(document.createElementNs('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'polygon'))
[21:27:31] <Forbidd3n> This is my jpg which I saved as svg in illustrator - http://oi61.tinypic.com/vpbudw.jpg
[21:27:48] <doga> Forbidd3n: or in reality, write a helper that creates namespaced elements
[21:28:01] <Forbidd3n> I need to draw boxes around each section
[21:28:03] <doga> jquery malfunctions on svgs a bit, you probably want an svg helper plugin
[21:28:14] <doga> Forbidd3n: yes that is easy with svg
[21:28:20] <doga> svg is perfect for that
[21:28:32] <Forbidd3n> doga: yeah, I heard, but not 100% sure on how to do it
[21:28:46] <Forbidd3n> I have illustrator or should I use something else
[21:29:17] <doga> Forbidd3n: you totally don't get that svgs are in the dom and you can dynamically make trivial shapes like those in code, right?
[21:29:20] <doga> no drawing program
[21:29:50] <doga> forget drawing programs, svg is easy enough to learn in a couple of hours
[21:29:53] <Forbidd3n> doga: yeah, but how do you draw boxes around the sections or define the points?
[21:30:11] <doga> did you look a the link?
[21:30:32] <doga> <polygon points="60,20 100,40 100,80 60,100 20,80 20,40"/>
[21:30:35] <Forbidd3n> the polygon one
[21:30:43] <Forbidd3n> yeah, but how do you define the points over an image?
[21:31:05] <doga> mathematically
[21:31:34] <Forbidd3n> so I have to create something mathematically that defines the x1, x2, y1, y2 points?
[21:33:17] <Forbidd3n> sorry for my ignorance
[21:34:03] <Forbidd3n> doga: still there?
[21:34:10] <doga> you put an image there that is a known size...
[21:34:26] <doga> why an image
[21:34:29] <doga> what is the image for
[21:34:38] <doga> svg is a way of drawing
[21:34:50] <Forbidd3n> that is the floorplan and I have to create tooltips on each section when reserved
[21:35:09] <doga> rectangular?
[21:35:19] <Forbidd3n> I have that image as an svg that I saved from illustrator
[21:35:22] <doga> just use transparent divs
[21:35:42] <Forbidd3n> ok so don't use svg to draw the boxes of the image?
[21:35:44] <doga> svg is for drawing
[21:35:52] <doga> there's no point using that for tooltips
[21:36:06] <Forbidd3n> ok, so I should use imagemap then?
[21:36:14] <doga> just make transparent divs and force them to be in the right place and size
[21:36:41] <Forbidd3n> ok so create a div a5 and specify the x1, x2, y1, y2 points?
[21:36:46] <doga> over the image, of course (they need to be after the image in the dom)
[21:36:47] <Forbidd3n> width and height
[21:36:52] <Forbidd3n> correct
[21:36:57] <doga> the image wil probably be a child of a positioned container
[21:37:25] <doga> if you make it position absolute and all those tip divs absolute, then it's all relative to the image
[21:37:26] <Forbidd3n> I think I understand
[21:37:34] <Forbidd3n> gotcha
[21:37:41] <Forbidd3n> so that will work I guess thanks
[21:38:09] <doga> you can do the ordering by order in the dom. anything later in the dom is automatically on top of anything earlier
[21:38:23] <Forbidd3n> do you know if there is a tool to help me figure out image points where to draw the points on the image
[21:38:33] <Forbidd3n> the coords I guess I am asking
[21:38:36] <doga> make one
[21:38:44] <doga> that is so easy I'd fiddle it
[21:38:52] <doga> ah...
[21:39:10] <doga>  a nice one would be an editor... with each region having a position, size, and tip text
[21:39:17] <doga> draggable etc
[21:39:20] <doga> right?
[21:39:54] <doga> there must be one, for that ancient technique of making weird shaped links
[21:40:06] <Forbidd3n> I'm looking
[21:41:08] <vdeep> Forbidd3n http://www.coffeecup.com/image-mapper/ for getting coords
[21:41:52] <Forbidd3n> there must be one online somewhere I can upload image and it tells me coordinates
[21:42:09] <Forbidd3n> I guess I can do it with dreamweaver imagemap concept
[21:52:15] <doga> Forbidd3n: I should be able to whip up a simple one
[21:52:26] <doga> seems like an interesting thing
[21:52:39] <Forbidd3n> I am willing to give a donation on a good solution
[21:52:50] <Forbidd3n> what would it do exactly?
[21:53:16] <Forbidd3n> it would be nice to dynamically select over the image an set the coord/tooltip for each one
[22:01:47] <Forbidd3n> doga: it has to be responsive as well though
[22:02:34] <doga> Forbidd3n: like this http://www.jstraight.com/1268/5
[22:03:08] <doga> just have to add dragging and click-select and perhaps drag select and a thing to edit properties of selection and you'd have a real editor :D
[22:04:01] <doga> oh and some thing to typin/drop a url to use as image
[22:04:20] <doga> then you could manually drag over each one and name them and whatever and save it as json
[22:04:33] <doga> then at runtime you just scale those coords
[22:04:49] <doga> perhaps store them in normalized coordinates, where 0.0 is left edge and 1.0 is right edge
[22:05:06] <doga> then coord * width = position
[22:06:02] <doga> treat them like texture coordinates
[22:41:08] <Ashroyalc> hi every one
[22:44:41] <Forbidd3n> doga: how would I make the points responsive?
