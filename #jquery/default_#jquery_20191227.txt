[22:28:39] <robertparkerx> I don't know why but I cannot get a success response to console.log. I can get the click action to console.log.
[22:31:25] <robertparkerx> I see in network tab that it was a success 200
[22:32:48] <pavonia> Could be the data transmission was fine but the parsing of the data afterwards failed
[22:47:38] <robertparkerx> but for another account the response prints
[22:47:42] <robertparkerx> same script
[23:07:05] <robertparkerx> It says parse error on errorThrown
[23:33:58] <robertparkerx> I got it
