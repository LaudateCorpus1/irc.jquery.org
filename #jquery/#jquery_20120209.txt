[00:00:48] <SlexAxton> pmcnabb: in the ready function you could just set the position from the top of the floating menu to the offset of the window
[00:01:14] <SlexAxton> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/303767/how-do-i-determine-height-and-scrolling-position-of-window-in-jquery
[00:01:25] <pmcnabb> SlexAxton: thank you, i'll look into that
[00:01:46] <SlexAxton> karamanolev: usually that means you need some extra styles on the bar, im trying to remember which
[00:01:55] <SlexAxton> try position:relative
[00:02:01] <SlexAxton> and/or width 100%
[00:02:20] <SlexAxton> oh wait, if you're using draggable
[00:02:23] <SlexAxton> that's not what you want
[00:02:33] <SlexAxton> just use a jquery ui slider
[00:02:50] <karamanolev> SlexAxton: I can send you a link if you wish to take a look at what I'm trying to do.
[00:03:00] <SlexAxton> i do not wish
[00:03:03] <SlexAxton> happy to guide though
[00:03:15] <SlexAxton> jquery ui sliders have that functionality built in
[00:03:21] <SlexAxton> and uses draggable under the covers
[00:03:39] <karamanolev> I'll have to remake the CSS styling to use jQuery slider, but obviously I'll need to go that way. Thanks.
[00:03:41] <SlexAxton> you can change the styles up quite a bit by hand
[00:03:58] <SlexAxton> it'll pay off in the long run
[00:04:08] <SlexAxton> there are quite a few gotchas with that
[00:04:18] <SlexAxton> especially with accessibility and keyboard support
[00:04:19] <SlexAxton> and stuff
[00:04:32] <karamanolev> SlexAxton: are you aware of any tutorials on creating styles for jQuery UI (no need to be specifically for slider)?
[00:06:33] <Gaia> Hello all, is this also the support channel? :)
[00:07:03] <SlexAxton> karamanolev: only the normal themeroller stuff, everything custom is just that, custom css
[00:07:12] <SlexAxton> if you play around in dev tools
[00:07:24] <SlexAxton> you can try out new positions and margins and paddings and stuff
[00:07:37] <SlexAxton> on the fly
[00:07:51] <SlexAxton> Gaia: most of the time
[00:08:04] <Gaia> Good morning all, i got a question about the datepicker from jqueryUI. Ty SlexAxton
[00:08:41] <Gaia> I changed my default language to dutch
[00:08:59] <Gaia> and i get my date like 09-02-2012
[00:09:22] <Gaia> how can i get this date in my colum DATE in my mysql?
[00:09:40] <Gaia> i can get it in with varchar, but with DATE? i dont know
[00:12:36] <mindis|wurk> wasn't the return format explained on the datepicker page
[00:22:59] <rahmen> Hi! I'm working on some jquery scripts that work against a rest api using ajax. The api is protected with a login function. So before my script starts using the rest api I ask for credentials from the user and sends the credentials to the rest api. If it's valid the user will get a logged in session and will be able to use the rest api. This works in firefox and chrome, but not in IE 9......
[00:23:01] <rahmen> ...Does anyone know why and maybe a work around? Thanks in advance!
[00:23:56] <Cork> rahmen: and what happens in ie9?
[00:24:09] <Cork> and what are you using for login?
[00:24:20] <rahmen> Cork:  The user can't use the rest api after the login
[00:24:47] <Xotix> Is the call of foo correct? http://pastebin.com/0hS91KUn
[00:24:50] <sjobidoo> hi all :) anyone know of a easy way to reset a fields value to its default on blur? :)  tried storing the default value in a global variable on focus..but the blur function doesn't seem to want to use that :P
[00:25:20] <Cork> Xotix: no
[00:25:35] <Cork> you need function in there
[00:26:03] <Xotix> Cork do you mean like function() {foo()} …?
[00:26:07] <rahmen> what am I using for login? What do you mean? It's asp on the server side and I'm just using a popup form where ajax sends the data.
[00:26:29] <Cork> Xotix: uh... what are you trying to do?
[00:26:44] <Xotix> rahmen please tell me the answer when you get it.  :)
[00:26:52] <Cork> either my.updateControlElements = function() {
[00:26:58] <Cork> or my.updateControlElements = function foo () {
[00:26:58] <rahmen> sjobidoo: I use the title attribute. But with html5 you could use any data- attribute you'd like. So data-default="My default text" and on blur set val to the default text.
[00:27:28] <Cork> rahmen: i meant basic auth, cookie login, digest auth...
[00:27:31] <Cork> it pased
[00:27:53] <Cork> *ip pass
[00:28:01] <Xotix> Cork, i came across this, was written few months ago. Back then i was trying getting my code organized somehwo and now i need to call a function like that. but i see, i wrote it wrong in the pastie.
[00:28:09] <nVee-YAM> Hey guys. Is there a way I can determine a functions return true/false by that of a $.post() call? http://jsfiddle.net/sQFPd/2/
[00:28:15] <Xotix> It should be my.foo = function() {}; My question goes to line 5.
[00:28:34] <nVee-YAM> I am trying to use $.post() to validate user input and if it returns true, then the function can return true, else it must return false
[00:28:38] <Xotix> nVee-YAM:  return an json with a success state?
[00:28:56] <Cork> Xotix: and whats "my" ?
[00:29:46] <nVee-YAM> Xotix: If the json returns true, it should return its parent function as true as well
[00:29:52] <nVee-YAM> else the parent function should return false
[00:30:13] <nVee-YAM> so the parent function's success is based on the return true within the json function
[00:30:15] <Xotix> but $post got a callback i think, you could use it. Cork :) I'd have guessed an obj but there isn't one initialised. Hmm, shitty  code.
[00:30:53] <Cork> Xotix: that code breaks in several places, yes
[00:31:37] <Xotix> It works actually, neede d to update something, it still works, but doesnt look nice
[00:32:05] <Cork> Xotix: vunless you create the my variable no it doesn't
[00:32:10] <Cork> *unless
[00:32:31] <Cork> the code in that pb, won't ever work
[00:32:38] <Xotix> nVee-YAM: why don't you use the success callback from post to call the parent function?
[00:32:55] <Xotix> Cork var my = {},
[00:33:26] <Cork> Xotix: if to, then just do my.updateControllerelements()
[00:33:29] <Cork> to==so
[00:34:40] <Xotix> Cork, mhm, aven't seen the my = obj either…that why i was weird. Make sense. But another question. Is a coding managment like this okay?
[00:35:14] <Cork> Xotix: can't relly tell, as i can't follow the code
[00:35:22] <sjobidoo> rahmen: that solved it..thanks :)
[00:35:53] <rahmen> sjobidoo: np
[00:36:02] <Cork> Xotix: but yes, functions declared inside a function is private; and if you return an object with functions on them they'r public
[00:36:22] <Gaia> Hello all, im trying to put the date from my datepicker (jqueryUI) in my database in a DATE colum. But it doesnt work. Can anyone help me with this problem? Thnx
[00:36:33] <Cork> Xotix: its common practis, though functions that can be shared is normally put on prototype and not directly on the object
[00:36:56] <Xotix> thanks
[00:40:26] <Gaia> bump
[00:40:26] <Gaia> <Gaia> Hello all, im trying to put the date from my datepicker (jqueryUI) in my database in a DATE colum. But it doesnt work. Can anyone help me with this problem? Thnx
[00:43:44] <nVee-YAM> Xotix: Could you elaborate perhaps? Sorry I have never done that before (sounds like i'll be learning something today)
[00:45:12] <Xotix> nVee-YAM:  You are validateing a form on serverside via ajax using $.post(), and want to handle the result of the validation correct?
[00:45:14] <mindis|wurk> Gaia i already told you formatting the date in datepicker is explained on the datepicker page (on the jqueryui site)
[00:46:33] <mindis|wurk> after you have the date in the correct format it's trivial to insert it into the db (though of course you should be checking it really is in the right format etc. on the server)
[00:46:38] <nVee-YAM> well, i want the ajax result to determine if my parent function should go ahead
[00:48:30] <Gaia> mindis|wurk Sorry, i didnt read it the first time :) and it idd worked :) thnx alot
[00:51:20] <mindis|wurk> np
[00:56:50] <Xotix> nVee-YAM: I just knew that $.post got a callback, never used it. I don't know if $.post's success callback checky by default for some default value or if you have to do the checking yourself. E.g. you could do this http://pastebin.com/0s2SwF4L but maybe there's a better solution.
[01:02:59] <intellilogic> If I wanted to "append" something just before a tag close, IE </body> what's the best way to do that?  (It must be all the way at the bottom, out of the way)
[01:03:54] <tw2113> $('body').append(stuff); ?
[01:14:24] <intellilogic> tw2113 will that put it at the end by the closing tag?
[01:14:40] <tw2113> it should if I understand .append() correctly
[01:14:53] <tw2113> either that or appendTo(), one of them should add to the end
[01:15:28] <intellilogic> Oh
[01:15:28] <intellilogic> I remembered it wrong, you are correct, thanks, LOL.
[01:15:50] <intellilogic> For some reason I had in my head that append was going to put it just after the opening tag, derp.  Thanks.
[01:16:01] <tw2113> ;)
[01:16:33] <tw2113> i need to learn the difference between append() and appendTo()
[01:18:23] <Xotix> Can i disable the focus blue border from chrome?
[01:24:09] <Cork> Xotix: -webkit-focus-ring-color
[01:24:15] <dirkos> is it possible to use a modalbox the same way as a confirm? So that i can override the confirm function of JS?
[01:24:32] <Xotix> thanks
[01:24:48] <Cork> dirkos: it can overide the normal confirm function
[01:24:54] <Cork> dirkos: but it can't work the same way
[01:25:10] <Cork> dirkos: the normal confirm halts the js code
[01:25:19] <dirkos> ah that is not possible another way?
[01:25:34] <Cork> as i said, you can do it
[01:25:43] <Cork> but it needs to follow a different syntax
[01:25:50] <dirkos> you got an example for me?
[01:25:52] <Cork> you need to use callbacks instead of return values
[01:26:03] <dirkos> example?
[01:27:24] <Cork> window.confim = function(question, callback) { $('#confirm').html(question).dialog({ buttons: { 'ok': callback } }) };
[01:27:30] <Cork> simplest posible form
[01:31:51] <intellilogic> I want to preform an action with jQueryUI Dialog closes?  I tried adding a '.ui-dialog-titlebar-close' click event, but that's not working.
[01:33:11] <Trisox> intellilogic: $( ".selector" ).dialog({close: function(event, ui) { ... }});
[01:33:16] <Trisox> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close
[01:33:24] <Trisox> its all in the documentation
[01:34:03] <intellilogic> Trisox: any ideas how I could do that w/ .on?
[01:35:05] <Cork> intellilogic: $().bind('dialogclose', function() {})
[01:35:26] <Cork> bind that on the dialog object and you'll get the event
[01:35:28] <intellilogic> Trisox, Cork - Got it, thans :)
[01:35:31] <intellilogic> *thanks
[01:36:11] <intellilogic> $(document).on('dialogclose', function(event){ $("[data-aj_obj='Dialog']").remove(); console.log('Distroy'); })  <-  SEXY
[01:37:16] <Cork> Distroy??
[01:54:01] <Xotix> Does jquery support somehow changing the styling of a scrollbar? No plugin.
[01:54:56] <larsemil> Xotix: yes it does, ALLTHOUGH a plugin is the best way to do it. :)
[01:55:24] <Xotix> Can't i use the normal jquery ui slider as a scrollbar for a div?
[01:56:34] <dddbmt> Hi guys, I am looking for the JS modules for twitter bootstrap. Then I saw this line of code, but I am not quite sure what the first argument for .on() is in this case?
[01:56:35] <dddbmt> var $el = $(element).on('click.dropdown.data-api', this.toggle)
[01:57:34] <Xotix> first defines the event. dblclick, click

[02:30:25] <imc> hello
[02:30:59] <imc> var obj = $('selector'); // now obj.lenght === 5   <-- is there a "removeLast()" method for jquery objects?
[02:31:36] <Cork> $('selector').last().remove()
[02:31:42] <imc> thanks Cork
[02:31:59] <Cork> or $('selector:last').remove()
[02:32:10] <imc> yep, but i saved the thing
[02:32:19] <imc> obj = $('selector'); obj.last().remove();
[02:32:31] <imc> perfectly fits
[02:32:50] <imc> mmm
[02:32:54] <imc> but obj is not updated
[02:32:58] <imc> only reflected in the DOM
[02:33:11] <imc> obj.length is still 5 after obj.last().remove();
[02:33:53] <imc> I would like something like: var popped = obj.pop(); popped.remove(); (pop() mutating obj)
[02:35:20] <imc> well
[02:35:33] <Xotix> What's a good scrollbar plugin?
[02:36:18] <imc> obj = obj.filter(':not(:last)')
[02:36:51] <imc> var popped = obj.last(); obj = obj.filter(':not(:last)'); popped.remove();
[02:37:53] <Cork> imc: ya, $('selector') isn't live
[02:38:05] <Cork> so you would have to update its array too
[02:38:09] <imc> yep
[02:38:22] <imc> seems good to you what i've wrote?
[02:38:46] <Cork> would prob use .not(':last') but, ya
[02:38:52] <imc> any shortcut? (i'm not used to use the DOM as Memory)
[02:38:57] <imc> perfect :)
[02:39:04] <imc> without .filter ?
[02:39:15] <Cork> ya, its the same thing
[02:39:18] <mindis|wurk> i wish jquery had a clickoutside event
[02:39:20] <imc> thank you
[02:39:29] <imc> mindis|wurk: bind on window ?
[02:39:56] <Cork> mindis|wurk: $(document).one('click', function() {});
[02:40:02] <Cork> it does :)
[02:40:30] <Xotix> Can someone help me setting up the most basic scrollbar with jscrollplane? I don't get it.
[02:40:35] <mindis|wurk> not the same thing if you consider certain issues like the propagation ending too soon if you use event.stopPropagation
[02:40:56] <Cork> mindis|wurk: ya, stopPropagation() is meant to do that
[02:41:03] <Cork> mindis|wurk: and theres no way around that
[02:41:09] <Cork> its just how dom events work
[02:41:12] <mindis|wurk> if you have multiple elements that should have clickoutside kind of behaviour it gets messy
[02:41:25] <imc> it's kinda logical mindis|wurk
[02:41:42] <imc> Omega = A + B + C + Rest
[02:41:57] <imc> Outside(A) = B + C + Rest; Outside(B) = A + C + Rest
[02:42:06] <imc> there is overlapping regions anyway
[02:42:13] <mindis|wurk> i doubt it would be impossible to have some form of checking within jquery
[02:42:35] <Xotix> I can use jquery template for a plugin so which puts content styled by this template into a div correct?
[02:42:36] <imc> mindis|wurk: you can track mouse position w.r.t. element position
[02:42:45] <Cork> mindis|wurk: it is, as there is no way for jquery to know if the dom doesn't tell it
[02:43:40] <mindis|wurk> Cork i still doubt it, i'm pretty sure it could do a few comparisons to see what conditions are met
[02:44:00] <Cork> mindis|wurk: it would have to bind events on every element in the dom
[02:44:07] <Cork> mindis|wurk: and thats DEAD slow
[02:44:31] <Cork> mindis|wurk: casue even mousemove can be stopPropagation'ed
[02:45:29] <mindis|wurk> hmmh, well the way i considered it could work is store the ones that have the outside condition and if the clicks don't land on those then they automatically trigger the outside behaviour
[02:45:52] <mindis|wurk> that list would almost always be a lot shorter than the whole dom
[02:46:21] <Cork> mindis|wurk: no, as you don't know what element can have an event listner with a stopPropagation on it
[02:46:26] <Cork> (or get one in the future)
[02:46:49] <Cork> mindis|wurk: the best and simplest solution is to be carefull with stopPropagation
[02:47:20] <Cork> and maybe check the event.target instead
[02:47:27] <Cork> depending on what you need
[02:56:43] <DreamStiffler> ok im here. and guess what..the days i took to study js and jquery for almost a week finally come to just 2 lines of jquery coding which are" superman = $(e).closest("td").next().text(); 	$(e).attr('value', superman); . Im saying this here not to mean that i regret learning it, just thought id share my thoughts as many of you had helped. thank you.
[02:57:12] <DreamStiffler> massive
[02:59:19] <muzone> At my side menu at http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/26/ - why won't the arrows change when you click "Deals" and "Size grouping"?
[03:08:11] <sahbeewah> background: url(http://home.no/dwaynie/arrow_hide.png))
[03:11:48] <fof> http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/FHZMd/27/
[03:12:16] <fof> you had their starting rotation incorrect also
[03:19:51] <fof> what's the moors google video about?!
[03:21:38] <muzone> hey thanks a lot guys
[03:21:50] <muzone> sahbeewah, fof
[03:21:56] <muzone> fof: moors?
[03:22:09] <muzone> fof: where did you see that?
[03:23:15] <fof> in the comments about the grid
[03:23:36] <muzone> fof: When the Moors Ruled Europe at http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-768956312207897325 at around 8 minutes in explains the use of the golden/divine proportion which is also used in grid systems
[03:23:50] <fof> i see
[03:25:48] <muzone> At http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/29/ - how come one can't just add class .hide to .foldable to hide it?
[03:29:32] <fof> dont understand the question
[03:29:50] <wewew> Hello evenrybody. I need script, which add to all foreign links target="_blank". Any ideas?
[03:30:51] <Lycurgus> do research
[03:31:41] <wewew> sad..
[03:31:43] <muzone> fof: well i'd like to be able to hide some of the stuff in "Narrow by" by default
[03:31:56] <wewew> I think we have some plugin
[03:32:14] <mindis|wurk> well this is interesting. if i click my element, stopping propagation works. rightclicking however does not stop propagation and it proceeds all the way to the documents click
[03:32:15] <Lycurgus> Houston, we have plugin
[03:32:54] <fof> muzone: then select each foldable list and hide them
[03:33:25] <fof> and remove the hide class from your li h4 tags in the html so it starts in the right place
[03:33:44] <muzone> fof: but as with the example side menu to the right - i'd like to have some foldables open by default and some closed
[03:36:06] <fof> dont know a more elegant way but why not have a class .startsfolded then
[03:36:30] <muzone> fof: that sounds doable..
[03:36:33] <fof> select and hide those
[03:36:37] <muzone> fof: have no idea what the hide class in the li h4 is doing there
[03:41:00] <fof> http://blog.citrusbyte.com/2010/09/17/jquery-toggle-widget-by-example/
[03:41:07] <muzone> fof: am i on the right path? http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/30/
[03:41:10] <fof> might be interesting to you
[03:41:16] <muzone> nice
[03:42:28] <muzone> fof: slightly outta my league though hehe

[03:47:54] <fof> sorry it's a quick thing, a bit busy
[03:48:12] <fof> you forgot to use .each() and were toggling the wrong element
[03:53:28] <krz> how do i get the values of a form and include them in $.post(...)?
[03:54:37] <mindis|wurk> there's even a sample for that on the manual page for $.post :(
[03:55:06] <krz> mindis|wurk: is there a way to sanitize the form values
[03:55:18] <krz> without having to pick the values up one by one
[03:55:19] <soahccc> Does anybody know a ticker resp. scroll plugin which loops like a infinite carousel? So that there is no gap at all?
[03:56:00] <fof> you could use a changed event on the input elements
[03:56:03] <chee> jquery.geocities.js
[03:56:50] <mindis|wurk> krz dunno what you want, i just usually loop through the inputs and whatever i need
[03:57:39] <fof> there will be examples of form validation that are easy to find
[03:58:28] <mindis|wurk> though it's debatable how useful that is since you have to do it server side anyway
[04:00:59] <krz> if i have a form element. how do i get the action so i can put it in: $.post('ajax/test.html', function(data) {
[04:01:06] <krz> instead of ajax/test.html
[04:01:26] <DreamStiffler> hi guys...im a noob in coding whichever language that is. I have a form with repeatable checkboxes in a dynamic table row. on submit when i post name=John&name=Mike&name=Ray... . what i need is to seperate this using pipe such as &name=John|Mike|Ray ... So anyone can suggest me what to be used?
[04:01:38] <mindis|wurk> i'd imagine it's under attr('action') for the form
[04:01:46] <krz> nope
[04:01:50] <krz> oh wait
[04:02:03] <krz> hmm ok

[04:03:55] <fof> not suggesting that's best :)
[04:04:55] <mindis|wurk> DreamStiffler is there a reason why you're not using arrays?
[04:05:26] <muzone> fof: bless
[04:05:38] <krz> mindis|wurk: .serialize() was what i was looking for
[04:05:55] <krz> in my first question. theres no need to go through a loop
[04:06:01] <cers> when using jqueryui's sortable, is there a way to force a position of an element that's dragged into a new list via connectWith?
[04:06:07] <fof> amen
[04:06:30] <risky_s> hi, is this regex correct for allowing only letters with a hyphen, problem is I need to allow spaces aswell - http://jsfiddle.net/Zswk8/
[04:07:29] <muzone> fof: trying to not hide the h4s though - maybe i should put the hidden on .foldable's child ul instead? http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/32/
[04:07:53] <cers> risky_s: include a space between the [] (for example, right before ])
[04:08:18] <risky_s> so after the hyphen?
[04:08:30] <risky_s> [a-zA-Z- ]?
[04:09:33] <cers> risky_s: that should work, as far as I know
[04:09:39] <DreamStiffler> mindis|wurk: because i dont really understand array. maybe you can suggest where is the simplest sample of an array that i can use. But before that, the next page that i am posting to already has a splitter function, so basically i need the parameters to be in such way.
[04:10:11] <mindis|wurk> ooookkkay...
[04:10:17] <mindis|wurk> forget what i said then
[04:10:52] <cers> risky_s: but your regex will probably fail for some letters (like æøå), so depending on what you're using it for, that might be a concern
[04:11:23] <risky_s> i need the regex for only letters, hyphen and spaces
[04:11:27] <mytrile_> How can I get all select boxes except 2 or 3 with specific ids ?
[04:11:31] <risky_s> the problem is it wont allow spaces
[04:11:38] <fof> muzone, dont understand
[04:12:51] <fof> you're deciding what element type to add the hideable class to?
[04:12:55] <cers> risky_s: yes, but æ is a letter, which isn't between a and z
[04:13:55] <muzone> fof: well at http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/FHZMd/31/ the "Size grouping" h4 shouldn't be hidden, as it's needed to unfold its child UL
[04:14:53] <fof> it wasn't being hidden before though
[04:15:07] <muzone> fof: im trying with http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/32/ but clicking "Size grouping" doesn't seem to wanna unhide the UL
[04:15:07] <fof> only its ul
[04:15:33] <muzone> thats right it wasnt.. but i'd like for it to remain a possibility though
[04:15:54] <DreamStiffler> mindis|wurk: does that mean...okayy youre on your own ..ookay i might try to figure something out to guide/help ya?
[04:16:02] <cers> risky_s: I'd use /^[\s\S- ]+$/
[04:16:11] <cers> (no /i)
[04:17:06] <muzone> i fucked it up real good didnt i, damn
[04:17:48] <risky_s> i used [a-zA-Z _- ] seems to be working now with spaces
[04:18:36] <cers> risky_s: again, that will fail for any letter not between a and z
[04:18:45] <risky_s> thats what I want
[04:19:04] <cers> risky_s: so it's not for people's names, addresses or anything like that?
[04:19:12] <mindis|wurk> DreamStiffler it means you're better off using what fof suggested instead of starting a lesson on what arrays are and how to use them
[04:19:12] <risky_s> yer its for peoples name
[04:19:33] <cers> risky_s: so what if their name contains letters not in the english alphabet?
[04:19:47] <cers> (or ' for example)
[04:20:17] <risky_s> you mean like european names with the `?
[04:20:23] <_bart> Is there a jquery mobile channel?
[04:20:39] <cers> risky_s: or with æøåöä
[04:20:41] <_bart> I have  a question related to jquery mobile: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9210674/phonegap-jquery-mobile-how-to-change-html-of-content-instead-of-page could somebody please take a look at it?
[04:21:06] <cers> risky_s: using the one I gave will take care of those too - but you'll still need to add ' for many irish names
[04:24:45] <muzone> At http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/33/ - how do I make it so that Size grouping's UL is hidden by default? I.e. like Color, Price, Brand etc. in the example menu to the right.
[04:24:49] <muzone> I tried setting class="hideable hidden" on its container li - but it didn't turn out so well.
[04:26:04] <cers> risky_s: actually, sorry, I made a mistake there take out the \S
[04:26:08] <kuya> hi, im constantly seeing the error "events.replace is not a function" in jquery, it doesnt actually seem to effect anything... but im wondering what it is
[04:26:37] <risky_s> ahh thats better lol, the numbers where being accepted
[04:28:18] <fof> http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/FHZMd/34/
[04:29:17] <muzone> fof: thank you so much man
[04:30:34] <dnsdds> How do I use $.browser in an if to cover Firefox 4 and higher?
[04:30:46] <fof> remember to use the each() iterator if you want to work on arrays
[04:31:23] <dnsdds> .versionNumber would be so handy if it worked every time, but alas, such is not the case
[04:33:23] * muzone is now playing: Homeage to fof (http://home.no/dwaynie/fof.mp3)
[04:34:39] <fof> luckily i have speakers or headphones
[04:34:48] <muzone> heheh
[04:36:13] <DreamStiffler> you mean http://w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp?
[04:38:50] <dnsdds> Guys? Anybody? Crickets?
[04:39:10] <slartsa> *crickety*
[04:41:27] <fof> muzone i'd probably strip out the classes and start that part over again
[04:41:54] <fof> at present it's difficult to select stuff
[04:44:26] <DreamStiffler> thanks i think this is correct. cheers mateys
[04:44:30] <muzone> fof: interesting
[04:45:36] * chee rs mateys
[04:45:47] <fof> toggleable, toggleable.header, toggleable.items or something
[04:46:23] <fof> and expanded/collapsed for the arrow images
[04:48:58] <diverdude> hello
[04:49:54] <dnsdds> slartsa: :c
[04:51:45] <jeffsmykil> is it possible to get .css("width") unitless?
[04:52:44] <mytoz> .width(), or parseInt(foo.css("width"), 10)
[04:57:56] <jeffsmykil> ty
[04:58:02] <jeffsmykil> i ended up parsing it
[05:04:39] <skylamer`> г
[05:05:11] <skylamer`> i, is there are way to load async html to current page without reloading, some thing like .load for urls, but that would be with the HTML type itself?
[05:06:26] <skylamer`> im now making it with 'html empty, then html and the data inside', but if there is other more cooler way , share it here
[05:06:46] <muzone> fof: im not sure how to go about your suggestion but it does sound like it'd be an improvement
[05:08:53] <diverdude> is there a good jquery websockets framework?
[05:09:45] <muzone> fof: http://www.target.com/c/women-clothing-tops/-/N-5xtbq#navigation=true&viewType=large&sortBy=bestselling&minPrice=from&maxPrice=to&isleaf=true&navigationPath=5xtbq&parentCategoryId=9975766&facetedValue=/-/N-5xtbqZ5xwsm&RatingFacet=0
[05:09:55] <muzone> fof: trying to replicate this functionality basically
[05:10:02] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: you need one? it's really simple to work with websockets front end
[05:10:33] <muzone> fof: you're saying i should change the li ul classes to toggable, and put in a seperate class for the arrows?
[05:10:57] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, do you know a tutorial which can show me how?
[05:11:15] <fof> not anything specific really, but make it easier to select the headers/items
[05:11:32] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: http://websocket.org/echo.html
[05:11:49] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: it's just onmessage, onopen, onclose etc.
[05:11:59] <Hooloovoork> and you parse the data and do stuff on those events
[05:12:17] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, ahh nice...thats just what i was looking for...hows the browsersupport?
[05:12:49] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: it's ok if you use the latest websocket draft. i think both chrome and firefox uses that in their latest versions.
[05:12:54] <Cake> A question, how do I go back one "attr" like if I had Div -> ul -> li -> a How do I get to "li" without writing id one every "li" after the "a" click?
[05:13:12] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: but i wouldn't use it in production without a fallback unless it's a demo site or something.
[05:13:26] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, hmm ok
[05:13:34] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, i got this on the demo page
[05:13:36] <diverdude> Uh-oh, the browser you're using doesn't have native support for WebSocket. That means you can't run this demo.
[05:13:36] <diverdude> The following link lists the browsers that support WebSocket:
[05:13:36] <diverdude> http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets
[05:13:50] <diverdude> not a very good sign :D
[05:14:02] <diverdude> And my browser is not that bad heh
[05:14:25] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, i run ff 10.0
[05:14:32] <Hooloovoork> diverdude: it depends on the severside of websockets too if you can use it
[05:14:49] <skylamer`> diverdude, that didnt mean
[05:14:50] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, but not in the demo?
[05:14:51] <Hooloovoork> i think firefox use the moz prefix for the websocket object.
[05:14:54] <skylamer`> that ur browser dont support websocks
[05:14:59] <skylamer`> yes, Hooloovoork
[05:15:28] <diverdude> skylamer`, no?
[05:18:20] <muzone> fof: hmm
[05:22:41] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, wouldn't it be a good idea to wrap it in something like socket.io ?
[05:24:02] <diverdude> Hooloovoork, also i cannot run this demo
[05:24:38] <ryan86> Hi, is there a way to add CSS styling to a textarea's value? (want to implement my own syntax highlighting by using regex and css)
[05:41:57] <cers> when using jqueryui's sortable, is there a way to force a position of an element that's dragged into a new list via connectWith? (eg, I want it to always be sorted to last)
[05:45:46] <chee> ryan86: i don't believe there is, boss. textarea's contents are printed as preformatted
[05:46:24] <chee> ryan86: i mean to say, if you stick a <span> in there, you're going to see "<span>" when you see it
[05:47:41] <chee> ryan86: what about using a <div contenteditable> ?!
[05:47:43] <chee> that would be hot
[05:54:20] <chee> ryan86: then you could have an editable textarea which you could have tags inside to highlight things with your magick syntax highlighting business, as per http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/wZsBp/
[05:55:13] <chee> i only really did that so i could do .☭ { color: red }​
[05:57:59] <Taar779> Hello, I'm trying to build a custom jquery tooltip widget but I'm running into some issues. As of right now, I'm trying to keep track of the windows height and width to know if the tooltip is going off screen. If an element is further down the page, the tooltip appears at the windows height and doesn't account for the scrolling of the page. Is there a way to know how far the user has scrolled down the page? jsfiddle is also down, so I can
[05:58:10] <ryan86> chee: I think using a div instead of a textarea maybe the solution, although I think this wouldn't allow me to paste code into the 'area'
[06:00:54] <g[r]eek> Hi. How do I select the value of "bar" when I have access to the "tr" element as $(this): <tr><input type='hidden' name='foo' value='...' /><input type='hidden' name='bar' value='...' /><td>...</td></tr>? Thanks
[06:01:47] <g[r]eek> I can change hidden input fields to use id instead of name if need be
[06:02:15] <dasim01> You can use .attr('name')
[06:03:03] <g[r]eek> dasim01, ok how do I specify which input field
[06:03:11] <g[r]eek> remember, $(this) is my <tr>
[06:03:17] <chee> ryan86: it would if you make it contenteditable !
[06:03:54] <dasim01> do a subquery on $(this) using $(this).find('input [name="*"]')
[06:09:22] <dasim01>  g[r]eek: Did that help at all
[06:09:26] <chee> ryan86: if you look at the jsfiddle link and click on the text in the results area, you can see that it is editable
[06:09:37] <g[r]eek> dasim01, I'm busy trying it now
[06:10:01] <g[r]eek> dasim01, yeah, works :)
[06:10:03] <g[r]eek> thanks

[06:12:25] <Talamaska> is there someone that can help with $.when()
[06:12:33] <Talamaska> I'm havving strange issues
[06:12:59] <dasim01> What's the issue Talamaska
[06:13:12] <Talamaska> if $.when() has 2 params 2 ajaxes
[06:13:29] <Talamaska> in done(xhr1,xhr2)
[06:13:32] <Talamaska> are arrays
[06:13:45] <Talamaska> but if i put only one ajax in the when condition
[06:13:47] <Talamaska> in done
[06:13:57] <Talamaska> xhr is the responseText not array
[06:14:25] <Talamaska> using 1.6.4
[06:15:21] <dasim01> i'm not sure, i'd need to see a code sample
[06:16:08] <Talamaska> I'll try to write in jsfiddle
[06:17:03] <Talamaska> it's not working
[06:17:05] <Talamaska> ...

[06:20:22] <cam_> who can help me with the keypress event?
[06:20:26] <cam_> it is not working
[06:24:23] <chee> ryan86: it's supported back to ie 5.5
[06:24:25] <Talamaska> here the example for $.when
[06:24:25] <Talamaska> http://jsfiddle.net/E4mz9/23/
[06:24:33] <Talamaska> look at the console
[06:26:20] <manisabri> Hi , does the off method remove handlers from memory ? (should I be worried about memory leakage?)
[06:26:21] <Talamaska> help anyone?
[06:28:36] <ryan86> chee: seems like a viable solution! having a play now, thanks a bunch!
[06:31:36] <cam_> hi there
[06:32:39] <dasim01> I have no idea Talamaska
[06:32:42] <Talamaska> is there someone to help with $.when
[06:32:45] <Talamaska> oh
[06:32:48] <Talamaska> you're here
[06:32:51] <dasim01> does it consistently do it
[06:32:59] <Talamaska> yes
[06:33:03] <dasim01> then just roll with it :)
[06:33:30] <Talamaska> have to check the typeof the thing that is returned
[06:33:41] <Talamaska> wondering about the $.map
[06:33:56] <Talamaska> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/about-when-then#14737000002892992
[06:33:58] <Talamaska> like here
[06:37:12] <manisabri> Talamaska: look at this video... its generally about deferreds .... very good tutorial
[06:38:00] <manisabri> http://vimeo.com/24404027
[06:38:12] <Talamaska> will it help?
[06:38:24] <cam_> http://jsfiddle.net/9wupg/7/
[06:38:26] <Talamaska> understanding
[06:38:33] <cam_> why does the keypress doesn't work?
[06:38:37] <Taar779> Could someone example to me why delegate doesn't apply to new elements when set within a widget?
[06:39:48] <Talamaska> Taar779, make sure that the context you're delegating a listener is loaded already
[06:40:12] <Talamaska> $(context).delegate(element,event,callback)
[06:40:22] <Talamaska> the context should be already in the dom
[06:41:33] <cam_> that is why i use the .on method
[06:41:43] <cam_> because the content generates after the dom is ready
[06:41:44] <topriddy> I have an issue, i have a div container...containing like 2 other links...I want all components to be clickable...including div itself. am having errors with this
[06:42:01] <DerekPioneer> i'm using jquery ui draggable and can't figure out to hide boxes when they're outside of a div
[06:42:02] <DerekPioneer> http://bit.ly/y00coJ
[06:42:03] <DerekPioneer> i
[06:42:25] <Taar779> Talamaska: Thanks
[06:42:58] <Talamaska> it was fo Taar
[06:43:11] <Talamaska> I'm loking at your code now
[06:44:05] <drummer306> topriddy : What's not working
[06:44:07] <topriddy> what to do please?
[06:45:48] <Talamaska> cam_, as i understand , because i didn't use .on till now, it's like delegate
[06:45:51] <drummer306> Derek :  looks like its almost working ?  Maybe play with the z-index a bit
[06:45:57] <Talamaska> your .test is not existing yet
[06:46:23] <Talamaska> put the .on in the prev click ev
[06:46:26] <cam_> if i use the .keypress directly it doesn't work
[06:46:59] <topriddy> drummer306: i cant seem to make both parent and child to react to onclick
[06:47:16] <topriddy> drummer306: if i disable child onclick events parent works and viceversa
[06:47:42] <cam_> somebody here told me i should use .on because the content is generated after the dom is loaded
[06:47:46] <drummer306> are your links display:block ? so they are expanding the whole div ?
[06:48:00] <Talamaska> oh and your duplicating the selector cam_
[06:48:00] <drummer306> otherwise, your links should be layered ontop of the div
[06:48:04] <cam_> and it work perfectly with the .on('click')
[06:48:12] <cam_> let me see
[06:48:19] <Talamaska> you cant use same selector for context and for descendant
[06:48:34] <Talamaska> at least i think so
[06:49:29] <cam_> the inputs that i generate has different id and name
[06:50:33] <Talamaska> cam_ see here http://jsfiddle.net/9wupg/10/
[06:51:22] <topriddy> drummer306: please are you saying div and link should catch event correctly by default
[06:52:56] <cam_> let me see
[06:54:59] <cam_> but is it necessary to be in $('#agregar').click(function(e){ ???
[06:58:42] <int_642> hello, I have a question about passing JS arrays in a get string
[06:59:06] <Hooloovoork> int_642: don't =P
[06:59:07] <int_642> When you do an ajax call, with $.GEt, $.POST , etc, jquery automatically formats the query string correctly for your arrays
[06:59:17] <int_642> Well, you know what I mean Hooloovoork :p
[06:59:28] <int_642> like when you have an argument set being passed in a ajax call
[06:59:45] <int_642> I agree it isnt ideal, but at the moment its my best option
[06:59:48] <Hooloovoork> int_642: you should send json over POST instead.
[07:00:02] <int_642> hmmm
[07:00:26] <drummer306> topriddy : http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/E4mz9/
[07:00:26] <int_642> so JSONify it, and post it...
[07:00:36] <int_642> ok, maybe thats the best solution...
[07:00:42] <drummer306> topriddy : yes it should work, but your going to run into issues
[07:00:42] <int_642> thanks, ill give it a whirl
[07:01:07] <Hooloovoork> sending with get means it will send this to the server your.server.com/api?data=[insaneammountsofdata: "in this url", "and": "it's gonna break if it's too long"]
[07:01:14] <Hooloovoork> kinda sorta
[07:01:19] <int_642> yeah I know
[07:01:28] <int_642> you are right
[07:01:31] <int_642> it could potentially break
[07:01:35] <ruby_on_tails> i am facing a problem with draggable
[07:01:46] <ruby_on_tails> if i drage something very quickly it breaks
[07:02:26] <Hooloovoork> so, use post instead and it'll be awesome =)
[07:02:52] <ruby_on_tails> but on the demo page that doesnt happen
[07:04:00] <Hooloovoork> ruby_on_tails: can you do a fiddle that breaks too?
[07:04:10] <ruby_on_tails> Hooloovoork: that would be tough
[07:04:35] <DerekPioneer> overflow: hidden is not working on my div. http://bit.ly/y00coJ
[07:04:53] <Hooloovoork> then try, and if it works in the fiddle look at what's different in your real version and the fiddle version. one of those things is the problem =)
[07:05:05] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[07:05:05] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[07:05:13] <DerekPioneer> posted in #jquery because it might be a jquery ui problem
[07:05:17] <diverdude> how do i read the value of a cookie using jquery? I need to know my php session id
[07:05:22] <Hooloovoork> cause we can't really help if all we know is that it breaks if you move stuff fast.
[07:05:46] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: it's probably a css selector problem.
[07:06:12] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: learn the dev tools of your browser and you'll fix it in 2 minutes =)
[07:07:25] <DerekPioneer> Hooloovoork: i'm looking at the dev tools in chrome and it's showing overflow:hidden on my wrapper div
[07:07:58] <PhanLord1> does anyone have issue with chrome 18 and <select> on jqueryUI dialog ? (it doesnt seem to select options  $(select).val() == null even though it displays as selected
[07:08:32] <PhanLord1> also selecting disabled doesnt do anything for that element
[07:09:07] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: i don't even know what's supposed to happen when to what so i can't really help.
[07:09:36] <Gozzy> diverdude there is no native cookie support in jquery, you need to get a cookie plugin
[07:09:42] <PhanLord1> ah stupd me :) had 2 elements with same id :(
[07:10:26] <DerekPioneer> Hooloovoork: if you click on the boxes inside of the image you can drag them around
[07:10:41] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: noticed that
[07:10:43] <DerekPioneer> i'd think that when they are outside of #templatewrapper, which is set to overflow:hidden (it has the blue border around it)
[07:10:52] <DerekPioneer> they wouldn't show anymore
[07:12:09] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: read up on overflow hidden and position absolute. it's  painfully tricky sometimes.
[07:12:39] <Hooloovoork> DerekPioneer: i'd prolly write my own draggable plugin that's relatively positioned instead of absolute.

[07:16:23] <bed777> hi guys
[07:16:36] <bed777> I'm using append to append some div into another element
[07:16:49] <bed777> Now, How can add more div in the top of the container?
[07:16:57] <bed777> before the others?
[07:17:05] <bed777> like a feed
[07:18:24] <bed777> http://dpaste.com/700314/plain/
[07:18:28] <bed777> This is my problem.
[07:19:02] <ablomen> bed777, use prepend instead of append
[07:23:22] <topriddy> drummer306: jsfiddle is under maintenance, i cant see nada in your link
[07:24:55] <dethkrieg> is this a valid javascript object? http://pastebin.com/dQWs07G7 -- or do the keys need to be unique?
[07:25:23] <ablomen> dethkrieg, they are
[07:25:43] <ablomen> (both valid, and the key's are unique per object)
[07:26:06] <dethkrieg> are you saying that is a valid object?
[07:26:14] <xec_> dethkrieg: that is a valid array
[07:26:15] <monk12> Does $('a.prev_btn').click(function(){ history.back(); return false; }); work on mobile browsers? trying even in FF with User Agent as Iphone and its not working.
[07:26:25] <dethkrieg> so when i do for(item in obj)
[07:26:28] <dethkrieg> it isnt working
[07:26:34] <dethkrieg> it's returning 434 results
[07:26:43] <xec_> dethkrieg: it is 4 objects, in an array
[07:27:04] <topriddy> xec_: you are here too.
[07:27:12] <ablomen> don't use for in to loop over array's, use for (;;;) loops
[07:27:14] <xec_> topriddy: you are surrounded!
[07:27:25] <topriddy> xec_: am going nuts :'(
[07:27:33] <ablomen> so for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) { .. }
[07:27:44] <dethkrieg> ablomen, thanks
[07:27:44] <xec_> topriddy: good news is; you're not paranoid - we ARE following you!
[07:27:46] <dethkrieg> i'll give it a shot
[07:28:25] <xec_> dethkrieg: you can also loop arrays with $.each()
[07:29:12] <xec_> dethkrieg: like $.each(myArray, function(){ /* this will be an item */ })
[07:31:22] <topriddy> xec_: really though, trying to summarize and put it on jsfiddle or something
[07:32:01] <xec_> topriddy: i don't really remember what your question was =/
[07:32:50] <xec_> topriddy: i think you can still use alpha.jsfiddle.net while the main site is down
[07:33:09] <dethkrieg> xec_, that's not working, the array is outputting each individual character
[07:33:27] <dethkrieg> maybe it's not recognizing it as an array :\
[07:35:08] <dethkrieg> ignore my question, something is messed up
[07:36:54] <bed777> ablomen not work, are you sure?
[07:37:50] <xec_> dethkrieg: http://jsbin.com/oheqix/edit#javascript,html
[07:38:06] <bed777> ok work :)
[07:38:08] <bed777> thanks ablomen
[07:38:08] <bed777> ;)
[07:38:20] <monk12> figured out my problem. blah jquery.mobile is somehow really messing up my regular jquery ajax stuff heh. simple .click's and .ajax don't work as they should.
[07:39:22] <xec_> monk12: you shouldn't include jquery mobile in addition to normal jquery - you need to choose one afaik
[07:39:46] <topriddy> xec_: please have a loook at this: http://mysticpaste.com/view/11619
[07:40:04] <Skyrock> Hello gentlemen
[07:40:52] <dddbmt> When developing a jquery plugin: Is it possible to give the plugin public methods? So if my plugin creates a calendar, I want to be able to do myInstance.set('month', 3) for example.
[07:40:54] <ezioa> what the hell happened to jqueryui.com
[07:40:57] <monk12> _xec: well just wanted to get one more question: http://jquerymobile.com/download/ doesn't the CDN copy-and-paste part show that jquery-1.6.4.min.js is downloaded in addition to jquery mobile?
[07:41:11] <topriddy> xec_: now it works, but it does bubble up.
[07:41:15] <dddbmt> and: var myInstance = $('#something').calendar()
[07:41:18] <Skyrock> I have multiple nested <ul>s and <li>s, and I need to select the immediate children <li>s of a <ul>, not the deeper ones
[07:41:19] <monk12> or like jquery.mobile uses jquery but i can't make direct calls with the jquery library?
[07:41:31] <dddbmt> then can I do myInstance.someMethod() ?
[07:41:34] <Skyrock> $('ul > li') doesn't work because all my <li>s are in <ul>s :(
[07:42:35] <quicksilver> Skyrock: $('#idofoneparticularul > li')
[07:42:58] <quicksilver> it doesn't have to be ID, but you just need a way to specific which UL you want.
[07:43:02] <Eviltwin> Skyrock: Or see ?children
[07:43:03] <bot-t> Skyrock, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[07:43:03] <xec_> topriddy: http://jsbin.com/ijexuj/edit#javascript,html
[07:43:05] <Skyrock> quicksilver: it doesn't have an id, I just have its object through $(this)
[07:43:12] <ezioa> anyone know why jqueryui is now a squatter page?
[07:43:19] <xec_> topriddy: e.stopPropagation() prevents bubbling
[07:43:20] <Skyrock> so, $(this).children()?
[07:43:23] <quicksilver> Skyrock: $(this).find('> li')
[07:43:30] <quicksilver> or $(this).children('li')
[07:44:04] <xec_> topriddy: if you want the browser to not follow links you can return false; or add e.preventDefault();
[07:44:35] <topriddy> xec_: i dont have e in my pastebin
[07:44:50] <muzone> ititjustmeorisjsfiddledown.com?
[07:44:51] <xec_> topriddy: did you see my jsbin?
[07:45:39] <xec_> topriddy: event handler is supplied with the event object as the first argument, i.e. .click(function(e){ ...
[07:46:06] <Skyrock> quicksilver: $(this).children('ul').children('li'); is what I needed. Can I write it better?
[07:46:25] <Eviltwin> .find('> ul > li')
[07:46:53] <Skyrock> Sorry, actually -- $(this).parent().children('ul').children('li');
[07:47:51] <Talamaska> cam_ are you still there
[07:48:01] <cam_> yes friend
[07:48:30] <Talamaska> check this out
[07:48:31] <Talamaska> http://jsfiddle.net/9wupg/15/
[07:48:32] <cam_> the code you helped me does an alert for each input in the #fotos div
[07:48:37] <cam_> let me see
[07:48:48] <Talamaska> this one doesn't
[07:49:05] <Kasreyn> i found a weird bug that only works in Firefox 3.5.16. javascript just exits on this line, i suppose parenthesis priority is the issue here? : $("#MyID_" + (match[1] - 1) + "_text").css("visibility", visibility);
[07:49:22] <topriddy> xec_: okay i copy. thanks. i didnt know of stopPropagation.
[07:50:06] <cam_> <Talamaska> now it works perfectly
[07:50:08] <cam_> thanks a lot!
[07:50:12] <Talamaska> :)
[07:50:23] <Talamaska> it was interesting for me to experiment with .on
[07:53:14] <_bart> Hi all, I have a question about jquerymobile but the people in #jquerymobile don't respond so maybe someone here can help me out. Normally when you change content in a jquery mobile page you have to run .trigger('create') on the parent to make sure styling is applied, but in this case it doesn't seem to work: http://pastie.org/3348822
[07:54:58] <dasim01> Talamaska did you ever figure out your deferred problem
[07:55:04] <Talamaska> nope
[07:55:21] <Talamaska> I'm thinking is it a bug or it's with purpose
[07:55:29] <topriddy> xec_: how can i consume event and prevent bubbling using pure javascript?
[07:55:43] <dasim01> Bummer. I didn't find anything in the api about what type of objects are returned
[07:55:45] <dasim01> or why.
[07:56:12] <xec_> topriddy: that sort of depends on the browser ;)
[07:56:16] <Talamaska> I've put a question in the forum
[07:56:26] <Talamaska> maybe someone from jquery team will see it
[07:56:27] <topriddy> xec_: awww
[07:56:49] <xec_> topriddy: jquery makes it nice and easy
[07:57:06] <topriddy> xec_: am not getting access to the function through jquery
[07:57:26] <xec_> topriddy: wha
[07:57:40] <xec_> topriddy: the demo i pasted to you works, doesn't it?
[07:58:19] <topriddy> xec_: the demo is very fine. have tested it. am in some server framwork context.
[07:59:16] <Talamaska> dasim01: from the forum
[07:59:17] <Talamaska> If there is only one deferred object, it acts as-if you simply used deferredObject.done()
[07:59:36] <xec_> topriddy: what sort of sorry excuse for a framework won't let you code javascript as you like?
[07:59:42] <Talamaska> it doesn't explain me why it's not a object but string
[08:04:02] <_bart> someone please take a look at my question!
[08:04:25] <p31n> hi all
[08:06:33] <topriddy> xec_: simply returning false would do it then.
[08:07:29] <xec_> topriddy: yes. but you do have an event object in pure js too
[08:07:57] <zymru> Hi
[08:07:59] <xec_> topriddy: and sometimes return false; stops more than you want it to
[08:08:08] <dasim01> Talamaska, did you see what happened when you used other deferred methods like .then()
[08:08:55] <zymru> http://pastebin.com/ahcs7v4B is this script well-written?
[08:08:56] <topriddy> xec_: if i can somehow get the event object in pure js and then pass it to jquery to do the magic.
[08:09:18] <Talamaska> I'll test
[08:09:46] <dasim01> .then() will be fired whether it is resolved or rejected, which isn't ideal, i just wonder how it treats those arguments
[08:10:03] <xec_> topriddy: i think you're overcomplicating things
[08:10:12] <zymru> http://pastebin.com/ahcs7v4B is this script well-written?
[08:10:45] <dethkrieg> in the JQuery UI autocomplete example,
[08:10:52] <Talamaska> same result
[08:10:54] <p31n> hi all
[08:10:54] <xec_> topriddy: is your event listener made using jquery?
[08:11:02] <p31n> need a little help here
[08:11:22] <dethkrieg> in the JQuery UI autocomplete example, remote with caching (http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache), why are they doing this check -- if(xhr === lastXhr) ?
[08:11:24] <xec_> zymru: what makes you ask? what does it do?
[08:11:35] <dasim01> It's probably intended to be that way, then.
[08:11:40] <Talamaska> done = success
[08:11:48] <xec_> ?ask @ p31n
[08:11:48] <bot-t> p31n, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:11:52] <zymru> xec_ it should post query
[08:11:53] <dasim01> What do you mean, Talamaska?
[08:12:14] <xec_> zymru: does it work?
[08:12:19] <_bart> I've posted it on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9214487/jquery-mobile-alternative-of-triggercreate-or-page-when-updating-navbar
[08:12:19] <Talamaska> from the video
[08:12:20] <Talamaska> http://vimeo.com/24404027
[08:12:23] <zymru> but when i typed $("#nudeop").click(function() { alert("abc") });
[08:12:27] <zymru> still dont work
[08:12:44] <topriddy> xec_: my event listener is made in Apache Wicket
[08:13:02] <dasim01> So it is working now? What did you do differently?
[08:13:14] <Talamaska> then should accept 2 args successCallback and errorClaback
[08:13:23] <Talamaska> while done is only one
[08:13:26] <Talamaska> i think
[08:13:28] <p31n> I dont know if it's ok to ask here, but it's a jquery thing also
[08:13:33] <dasim01> I, see.
[08:13:52] <zymru> xec_ you know why its dont work ?
[08:13:57] <p31n> I wanted to change the option buttons from magento to stars using jquery
[08:14:14] <Talamaska> so if i have var xhr = $.ajax({})
[08:14:14] <zymru> jquery dont react
[08:14:19] <supsup> aw jsfiddle is down
[08:14:35] <Talamaska> i can make xhr.done(callback).fail(callback)
[08:14:40] <xec_> zymru: no idea, can you demonstrate in a demo? try jsbin.com
[08:15:01] <zymru> And here is problem
[08:15:05] <xec_> topriddy: i have no idea what that is, i'm afraid :)
[08:15:06] <zymru> its work on jsfiddle
[08:15:11] <zymru> and other sites
[08:15:14] <zymru> but dont work on my site
[08:15:15] <dasim01> That's interesting.
[08:15:17] <zymru> i dont know why
[08:15:24] <zymru> $("a#close-panel").click(function(){
[08:15:24] <xec_> zymru: do you get any errors in console?
[08:15:29] <zymru> this function work
[08:15:42] <ciro_nunes> hey guys, i'm looking for develop a slideshow with 'carousel navigation'. Now i'm thinking about how to write a reusable and modularized code. How can I do that? My first solution is use the jQuery plugin pattern to create 2 separated plugins "one slideshow and one carousel" then the third to manage dependencies and initialize other 2...
[08:15:48] <ciro_nunes> sorry for my english :p
[08:15:51] <zymru> I not checked
[08:16:40] <zymru> xec_ where this console is ?
[08:17:05] <xec_> zymru: i suggest you take a look at this fixingthesejquery.com
[08:17:36] <ciro_nunes> nothing?
[08:18:19] <phrontist> with jquery_validate, which validation rules have associated CSS classes by default? the "required" class clearly binds the required rule, but "email" doesn't seem to
[08:19:16] <zymru> chrome audits not found any errors
[08:19:24] <zymru> sec i will check in firebug
[08:21:39] <zymru> xec_ no errors
[08:22:20] <xec_> zymru: do you have a live url where the issue occurs?
[08:23:23] <zymru> yes, but i would send it on priv
[08:23:26] <zymru> xec_
[08:24:55] <xec_> i'm not your personal support guy, and likely won't be able to help - if you want someone to take a look at it you can post to channel, but there's no guarantees given that anyone can or will help
[08:25:45] <xec_> it's completely optional - if you don't want to share a url, don't share it
[08:25:55] <zymru> you're right
[08:26:25] <zymru> but I cant share url becouse its NSFW site (not porn, but womens_
[08:26:57] <topriddy> zymru: i am interested in this url :D <3

[09:05:02] <DerekPioneer> sort() array is returning "object has no method sort" http://pastebin.com/y5jGz6Xb
[09:06:38] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: sort is a global IIRC
[09:06:54] <johnkpaul> no it's not
[09:07:11] <krz> i really don't get sound clouds html4 upload process. how the heck are they doing it? http://soundcloud.com/upload#old-skool I'm trying to implement something similar. but direct uploads to s3. I've managed to do it with a simple form. but the problem is submitting other data together with the file. with a simple form. i can't get a callback from amazon s3, to indicate that the file has been uploaded. or am i missing something?
[09:07:36] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: what?
[09:07:49] <johnkpaul> nothing, I was mistaken, my mind was in PHP
[09:07:58] <johnkpaul> :) the issues with being in multiple channels
[09:08:15] <DerekPioneer> i understand
[09:08:23] <ngharo> DerekPioneer: works fine here
[09:08:31] <DerekPioneer> wtf really
[09:08:55] <johnkpaul> yeah, it works for me as well actually
[09:09:15] <johnkpaul> perhaps you've messed with Array.prototype?
[09:09:23] <johnkpaul> can you check if Array.prototype.sort is a function
[09:10:10] <DerekPioneer> problem was that i was calling someone's third party array_unique() right before using sort
[09:10:18] <DerekPioneer> if i call sort() first everything works
[09:11:38] <ngharo> DerekPioneer: likely the other function is not returning you an array
[09:12:02] <DerekPioneer> i then iterate through it with $.each(fontFamilies,
[09:12:05] <DerekPioneer> and it works fine
[09:12:30] <ngharo> each will work on objects, sort will not
[09:15:21] <cliffordmeece> With draggable, can I have the constraint based on my handle?  or a way to specify the cushion?  MY draggable element has lots of padding( and my handle has lots of margin) and setting a constraint makes it hard to get close to the constraint.
[09:17:24] <cliffordmeece> in other words, I'd like to constrain the handle, not the draggable.
[09:21:18] <Surrealis> How can i use jQuery to tell me the input type. I've slected the element i want, but it could be a checkbox or a radio button
[09:22:04] <Surrealis> and i need to do something different if it is a radio button
[09:23:30] <cam_> how can i execute some code (or call a function) when a event has terminated?
[09:26:25] <johnkpaul> cam_: what do you mean "terminated"?
[09:27:04] <ngharo> Surrealis: this.type
[09:27:24] <Surrealis> okay double werid cause i thought that too
[09:27:28] <Surrealis> but i get an erro
[09:27:29] <Surrealis> r
[09:27:31] <Surrealis> :|
[09:27:45] <ngharo> code?
[09:27:47] <Surrealis> off to jsfiddle
[09:28:03] <ngharo> jsfiddle is read only atm :[
[09:28:24] <Surrealis> alert(parent.type);
[09:28:53] <ngharo> is parent a jquery object?
[09:29:11] <ngharo> also, save a whale and use console.log instead of alerts
[09:29:22] <Skyrock> how does that save a whale?
[09:29:25] <Surrealis> yeah : var parent = $('#' + parentId);
[09:29:53] <ngharo> Surrealis: you can parent.attr('type') in that case
[09:30:03] <ngharo> or parent.get(0).type or parent[0].type
[09:30:51] <xec_> Surrealis: quick question, what is parentId - an ID of a *parent* element?
[09:31:00] <Surrealis> yeah
[09:31:16] <xec_> how can a checkbox or radio button be a parent of anything
[09:31:25] <Surrealis> ah
[09:31:34] <kirbysayshi> xec_: in the shadow dom, anything is possible
[09:31:35] <Surrealis> parent in my case, is parent to other child inputs
[09:31:44] <xec_> kirbysayshi: dun dun duuuuuuh
[09:31:50] <kirbysayshi> xec_: :)
[09:31:53] <Surrealis> lol
[09:32:34] <Surrealis> so in my case parent checked shows and then clears and array of other inputs
[09:32:38] <Surrealis> and vice verea
[09:32:49] <xec_> ?demo @ Surrealis
[09:32:50] <bot-t> Surrealis, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:33:01] <xec_> if jsfiddle is still down, try jsbin.com
[09:33:59] <Surrealis> strangely parent.attr('type')  works
[09:34:07] <Zzaichik> *phew* at least my fiddles are safe.
[09:35:54] <ngharo> Surrealis: that's not strange at all really
[09:36:25] <ngharo> jquery objects have different methods and properties than DOM elements
[09:37:06] <redheadphones> i'm starting to learn qunit and was wondering how to script the tests from the command line. something for continuous integration like buildbot.
[09:37:27] <ngharo> you can always get access to the raw DOM element through a populated jquery object; thats what get() does, see ?get
[09:37:28] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[09:37:37] <ezioa> fak ... anyone know when shit's gonna be back up on jqueryui?
[09:39:59] <James13433> best way to change this to just click the first one ? jQuery('.configurable li').trigger('click');
[09:40:21] <ngharo> ?first @ James13433
[09:40:21] <bot-t> James13433, .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[09:40:49] <James13433> ngharo, ahh its so much eaier to do vs prototype.js ha
[09:42:52] <James13433> thanks ngharo
[09:44:31] <robotriot> hey guys, it's been a long morning.. i want to find out if a siblings child has a class.. whats the most efficient way of doing that? if im just looking for a class of active, would it be, $this.siblings().children('div').hasClass('active'); ?
[09:46:21] <Mr_Grim> hey guys. I have a custom div container containing a table with my own custom CSS and I am wondering how I display that window and dim the rest of the screen until the window is closed. I also need the window to be dragable but I did figure that out with using .dragable(); any suggestions? i know that jquery has a dialog() function but my table is all custom
[09:46:35] <johnkpaul> robotriot: .siblings.children("div.active")
[09:46:37] <johnkpaul> will work too
[09:48:43] <ngharo> Mr_Grim: best to just inspect jquery-ui modal dialog, or any other lightbox type dialog
[09:48:47] <robotriot> johnkpaul: thank you! that makes more sense!
[09:49:21] <ngharo> Mr_Grim: create a full screen "mask" overlay, then set the z-index greater than the overlay on your window
[09:55:23] <Surrealis> mr_Grimm blockUI can do that as well
[09:56:12] <sphinxxx> how can i select an a tag based on its href value?
[09:56:59] <rue> "a[href=value]" ?\
[09:57:01] <idr0p> hey all
[09:57:54] <idr0p> i am looking to take a set of 3 images and when i click a button take hte last image and put it in front. i was using prepend() is that the right function?
[09:58:03] <sphinxxx> rue: what if i have a variable that contains the href
[09:58:18] <sphinxxx> headache -->   $('a[href=#filter='+hashOptions.filter+']').addClass('active');
[09:58:56] <sphinxxx> the a tags i have are like this <a href="#filter=.red">
[09:59:36] <ngharo> sphinxxx: you should be using data attributes for storing abitrary data, see ?data
[09:59:37] <bot-t> sphinxxx, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:59:47] <boobo> Hello... is it better to use e.target.checked than $(this).is(':checked') ?
[09:59:55] <ngharo> <a data-filter="red">
[10:00:08] <sphinxxx> ngharo: i'm using isotope along with jquery bbq,  in their tutorial they store the hashes in the href attribute
[10:00:23] <sphinxxx> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/hash-history-jquery-bbq.html
[10:00:33] <sphinxxx> idk why
[10:01:08] <idr0p> i am looking to take a set of 3 images and when i click a button take hte last image and put it in front. i was using prepend() is that the right function?
[10:01:20] <muzone> damn
[10:01:24] <muzone> jsfiddle still down??
[10:03:52] <nerdlor> to select radiobuttons with jquery, i use $(elt).attr('checked', 'checked') -- works fine. when i use jqueryui to create a buttonset(), this no longer appears to work. is there some other way manipulate the checkedness with jqueryui-ized radio buttons?
[10:05:56] <ngharo> nerdlor: call .refresh() on the jqueryui button
[10:06:05] <ngharo> err .button('refresh')
[10:06:22] <ngharo> nerdlor: and you should be using prop() instead of attr for that, see ?prop
[10:06:22] <bot-t> nerdlor, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:07:29] <chee> \c/
[10:09:40] <nerdlor> right -- prop() and attr() both behave the same way
[10:09:50] <nerdlor> ngharo: refresh() on the changed button, or buttonset?
[10:12:10] <ngharo> nerdlor: not sure
[10:12:14] <ngharo> let me know which one works
[10:12:29] <ngharo> i havent worked with buttonsets much
[10:14:09] <nerdlor> ngharo: neither appears to work. i'd put it down to some dumb mistake on my side, but the fact that they work when they're not jqueryui-ized (via buttonset()) makes me wonder...
[10:14:49] <ngharo> nerdlor: hmm lemme try it, i do use buttonset in one part of my app
[10:15:16] <nerdlor> ngharo: much appreciated
[10:16:09] <ngharo> doh, i have a buttonset made from <button> elements
[10:18:07] <nerdlor> ngharo: i was using this http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/radio.html as an example
[10:19:38] <ngharo> nerdlor: http://jsbin.com/oxucal/edit#javascript,html
[10:19:40] <ngharo> this appears to work
[10:20:58] <Mr_Grim> ngharo what lightbox plugin works well with a plain div container?
[10:21:03] <Mr_Grim> i was trying to find one a week ago
[10:22:22] <nerdlor> ngharo: thanks, i'll deep deeper.
[10:24:52] <nerdlor> ngharo: gah! got it. need buttonset('refresh'), not buttonset.refresh(). thanks. time for lunch.
[10:25:59] <ngharo> indeed :)
[10:37:57] <LzrdKing> my web application in trying to load /var/www/html/null and chrome dev tools says its from jquery1.js line 115 which is:
[10:38:00] <LzrdKing> f[e]}});if(c.expr&&c.expr.filters){c.expr.filters.hidden=function(a){var b=a.offsetWidth,d=a.offsetHeight,f=a.nodeName.toLowerCase()==="tr";return b===0&&d===0&&!f?true:b>0&&d>0&&!f?false:c.curCSS(a,"display")==="none"};c.expr.filters.visible=function(a){return!c.expr.filters.hidden(a)}}var qb=K(),rb=/<script(.|\s)*?\/script>/gi,sb=/select|textarea/i,tb=/color|date|datetime|email|hidden|month|number|password|range|search|tel|text|time|url|week/i,
[10:38:22] <LzrdKing> wow, did that come out right?
[10:38:50] <LzrdKing> anyway, why does it end up trying to get "null"?
[10:42:29] <Eviltwin> LzrdKing: Develop with unminified code
[10:42:30] <ngharo> wat
[10:42:38] <Eviltwin> And please don't paste huge blocks of code directly here
[10:42:45] <Eviltwin> Use pastebin or pastie or something
[10:43:21] <LzrdKing> Eviltwin: sorry, its what i got, and i didn;t think it wualified as a "huge block" as it was only one line
[10:43:44] <LzrdKing> qualified*
[10:44:43] <Eviltwin> For minfied code, a single line could be over 1k
[10:45:00] <LzrdKing> well i knew it wasn;t that long :)
[10:45:01] <Eviltwin> Not to mention that no one wants to read minified code
[10:45:09] <Eviltwin> And you're here asking for help, not paying for it
[10:45:13] <LzrdKing> yeah, agreed, but it's what i got
[10:45:29] <Eviltwin> So develop with unminified code
[10:45:35] <Eviltwin> And follow the instructions at see ?ftj
[10:45:35] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:45:42] <Eviltwin> To learn how to debug these things
[10:46:02] <LzrdKing> i'm not the developer; i wonder what the devs are using
[10:46:15] <LzrdKing> but i will check the link, hopefully it will give me some insight
[10:46:52] <chee> sonicmouse
[10:47:02] <Eviltwin> This gives a breif overview of what every half-decent jQuery developer does to debug code
[10:50:05] <LzrdKing> this won't be easy; i should just kick it to the devs
[11:03:09] <anjen> LzrdKing: just use gist or pastebin for things like that. If possible find the un-minified version. Much easier to debug
[11:07:13] <LzrdKing> antnash: agreed
[11:07:32] <LzrdKing> err anjen
[11:07:39] <LzrdKing> who left
[11:08:22] <Mr_Grim> can anyone recommend a lightbox plugin that works with div tags?
[11:08:33] <Mr_Grim> i dont care about url's or iframes or an image gallery
[11:08:41] <Mr_Grim> i just want a straight up lightbox for a div tag
[11:08:50] <antnash> huh? What did I say that was so salient?
[11:10:57] <macclearich_> I'm sure this has been asked and answered about eight million times, but I have an issue with binding validation to a form loaded via ajax.
[11:11:39] <oldmeaty> Mr_Grim: what are you trying to open?
[11:11:42] <smplstk> macclearich_: gotta bind the validation stuff in the callback
[11:11:52] <macclearich_> that's what I'm trying to avoid
[11:12:22] <smplstk> what kind of validation are you talking about, server-side or front-end?
[11:12:37] <macclearich_> client
[11:13:07] <macclearich_> I have a nice, elegantish way of loading a modal via ajax using a common handler - no specific code to load one or another
[11:13:18] <macclearich_> so I can't really put bindings for ALL the possible forms into that callback
[11:13:39] <smplstk> ah, ok - well you could look at something like on()
[11:13:53] <smplstk> which would bind stuff for future elements too
[11:14:02] <smplstk> ?on @ macclearich_
[11:14:02] <bot-t> macclearich_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:14:49] <pawel__> hello jquery crowd, I'm having trouble implementing a tagging plugin into my rails app even though I've got it working in regular html. I've added the code here https://gist.github.com/1782131 and although you may not understand the ruby in there, I've pasted the generated (inspected) code too. Please help?
[11:15:58] <macclearich_> looking at that now.
[11:16:45] <macclearich_> so if I were to say $("#modal_form_element").on("load", function() {…});, that would work?
[11:16:51] <macclearich_> not sure of the event to use there
[11:17:47] <Mr_Grim> oldmeaty i have a custom dialog box with my own CSS. i just want to display the dialog box and dim the rest of the screen
[11:17:56] <Mr_Grim> i am not using jquery UI theming
[11:18:18] <macclearich_> could I, in the unified callback func, put a $("modal_form_element").trigger("bindvalidation"); and then use that as the event for on()?
[11:18:58] <oldmeaty> Mr_Grim: check out Colorbox (http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/)
[11:19:25] <oldmeaty> Mr_Grim: they have an example with inline HTML that sounds like what you are trying to do
[11:26:19] <macclearich_> ok, tried that.  Seems like it should work, but doesn't.  In the success handler, I call $("#modal_container").trigger("bind");
[11:26:59] <macclearich_> I have another block elsewhere that says "$("#modal_container").on("bind", function(e) { alert('hi'); });
[11:27:03] <macclearich_> which isn't being fired.
[11:30:41] <chovy> is there a better way to do this?
[11:30:42] <chovy> var note = $($(".notes").get(0))
[11:30:49] <blazento> Hey, I've built a custom pagination widget with javascript, and when I click on "next page", my link returns false, so there's no page jump. However, some of the records in the paginated collection are longer than others. #1 considering that my pagination view is below my paginated collection, would the change in size of the collection explain the page jump i'm experiencing? #2 how do others deal with this type of issue?
[11:32:01] <kenperkins> can anyone recommend your favorite landing pages?
[11:32:06] <kenperkins> trying to do some research
[11:32:45] <soee> hi, how can i get sum of all <li> elements width that dont have class X ?
[11:33:09] <lar_zzz> chovy: var note = $(".notes").first();
[11:33:50] <chovy> lar_zzz: thanks
[11:34:02] <chovy> what does that return if $(".notes") is empty?
[11:34:13] <chovy> ie it doesn't exist on the page.
[11:34:18] <Guest49127> Hey everyone,
[11:34:40] <Guest49127> I'm trying to add a click handler to a bunch of divs that are being created in a xls:for-each loop
[11:34:52] <lar_zzz> chovy: nothing ... note.length === 0
[11:34:59] <Guest49127> I was able to get everything working using .live
[11:35:06] <Guest49127> but that didn't seem to work cross browser
[11:35:13] <Guest49127> so I'm trying to use on
[11:35:23] <Guest49127> but it seems to only attach the handler to the first div
[11:37:38] <tuibm> Hello, in the ui autocomplete is any way to prevent user to type words that are not on the list?
[11:39:52] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Guest49127
[11:39:52] <bot-t> Guest49127, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:40:31] <smplstk> macclearich_, you'd use on() for the actual submit event
[11:40:43] <Guest49127> fnode'Kambfhase;  it's an XLST so it's really nothing more than .on("click'
[11:40:49] <smplstk> macclearich_, if it's easier you could take a look at malsup's form plugin: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[11:41:09] <Guest49127> I just need to defer the call after my xls loops are finished
[11:41:13] <Guest49127> or recreate whatever .live did
[11:41:16] <Kambfhase> please paste you resulting xhtml code and the js
[11:42:25] <Guest49127> here you go
[11:42:26] <Guest49127> http://pastebin.com/REK57jWf
[11:43:08] <Kambfhase> you do know, you can have only one <div> with id #spanInfo right?
[11:43:13] <Kambfhase> ?valid ID
[11:43:14] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[11:43:54] <Guest49127> ah
[11:43:55] <Guest49127> yes
[11:46:53] <Phoenixz> I have a system that displays time stamps, and I'd like this timestamp to be in 12H or 24H format, depending on what the user wants. Now, instead of making that a configurable option, might there be a way that I can use javascript to access the users system time display configuration (I guess thats locale information?)
[11:48:54] <Kambfhase> (new Date()).toLocaleString()
[11:49:48] <Kambfhase> Or maybe you want https://github.com/jquery/globalize @ Phoenixz
[11:51:08] <tuibm> Hello, in the ui autocomplete is any way to prevent user to type words that are not on the list?
[11:51:33] <Phoenixz> Kambfhase: okay, thanks!
[11:51:47] <macclearich_> smplstk, that's not really what I'm talking about here.  I'm trying to bind a jquery validation to a form that doesn't exist yet.
[11:52:42] <Joeytje50> hey, I want to find and replace a certain string in the body, but I only want it to match text, not tags/attributes
[11:53:10] <Joeytje50> I tried $('body').html($('body').html().replace(/\b(javascript)\b/ig,'<a href="#">$1</a>')) but that also replaces things like <a href="javascript:void(0);">.</a>
[11:53:28] <smplstk> macclearich_: I'd have to see code examples to better explain
[11:53:29] <Joeytje50> so is there something I could use that only matches text, not tags/attributes?
[11:53:48] <smplstk> but some sort of on/live/delegate thing does indeed sound like what you're after
[11:54:07] <Kambfhase> ?text @ Joeytje50
[11:54:07] <bot-t> Joeytje50, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:54:08] <smplstk> like "validate all forms now and in the future plz"
[11:54:10] <macclearich_> yeah, it's starting to work
[11:54:35] <macclearich_> my only problem now is that the validator plugin works the FIRST time the modal is loaded, but if it's dismissed and reloaded, it doesn't work the second.  Maybe a stale handle or something.
[11:55:05] <Joeytje50> Kambfhase: but $('body').text($('body').text().replace(/\b(javascript)\b/ig,'<a href="#">$1</a>')) replaces all content with plain text, and I just want it to replace the keywords with a link
[11:55:05] <smplstk> macclearich_: how are you calling the validation/
[11:55:07] <smplstk> ?
[11:55:32] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[11:56:10] <macclearich_> here's what I did
[11:56:22] <Kambfhase> you could traverse the DOM tree and do .contents() and replace each, ... basically i have no idea if there is a smart way to do that.
[11:56:24] <macclearich_> I stuck an empty span with an id in the doc to give something for .bind() to work on
[11:56:33] <macclearich_> that's fine
[11:56:33] <Joeytje50> hm okay
[11:57:12] <macclearich_> so I open the modal, load the form, trigger the "bind_validate" event, and the .bind() works - which is where I declare the validation rules.  $("#modal_form").validate({ rules: {…} });
[11:57:19] <macclearich_> this works the first time through.
[11:57:41] <tuibm> Hello, in the ui autocomplete is any way to prevent user to type words that are not on the list?
[11:57:47] <macclearich_> I close the modal, re-trigger it, see the trigger()/bind() events happening, and try to use the form again, and it no longer validates.  bloody thing...
[11:59:53] <JillesCode> Guys, can you .load() external webpages their div's? for example: $('#news').load("http:/cnn_relpostn" .breakingnews p ); ?
[12:00:43] <macclearich_> JillesCode, i've done something like that by looking for elements in the returned document from an ajax call.  Put it in the success callback and you probably have what you need.
[12:01:22] <kara_sweets> hello!
[12:03:13] <kara_sweets> When you send an asynchronous request and the page fetches data without reloading, why is this considered asynchrounous, when it seems like if anything the request is happening synchronously with the page?
[12:04:48] <Kambfhase> it is called 'async' when your JavaScript execution is not blocked.
[12:05:33] <vaxinate> kara_sweets: you'll find that execution of your script will continue after an async call (via one of the ajax methods or some such)
[12:06:10] <dibs> Is it possible to get the individual options in a select list and store each one with the full surrounding html (i.e <option clas....> something </option>) in  var so I can build a new select list?
[12:06:46] <vaxinate> kara_sweets: so while the initiation of the call is synchronous once it gets fired off, your script won't be blocked. that's why you have to pass a success method or use the success event to fire off logic that should happen if the request is successful
[12:07:13] <Kambfhase> dibs: try .clone()
[12:07:19] <dibs> I understand hiding and revealing options in a select list is not cross browser and so I wanted to destroy the original select list and replace it with an edited one instead of hiding
[12:07:24] <dibs> Kambfhase: ty
[12:16:40] <kenyabob> Anyway to have .get return me an jquery object, not the dom element
[12:16:59] <kenyabob> .eq() sorry
[12:18:39] <jeffsmykil> Anyone have experience with the Bootstrap Popovers?
[12:18:41] <soee> dos outerWidth include border in totla element width ?
[12:22:08] <hays> I am adding some DOM information using jquery and latery trying to select on it, and it appears this is not working. Am I doing something wrong?
[12:22:33] <hays> $(this).prepend( '<input></input>' );  essentially is what I am doing
[12:22:34] <kara_sweets> anybody else seen jsfiddle today?
[12:23:19] <anjen> kara_sweets: it's been down for upgrade all day afaik
[12:23:41] <anjen> well...partially down anyway
[12:24:25] <kara_sweets> yea, well if anybody wouldnt mind taking a look at a read-only fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/7NUX6/7/, basically the last line where the $('form').removeClass is, how would you just remove the form entirely and display a div that says " Success!"?
[12:26:12] <pulse00> hi all. i'm using the http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ javascript library to pimp my select ui elements. it's done by calling $('.mySelect').chosen(); is there a way to call the .chosen(); method on dom elements loaded via ajax without using the livequery plugin?
[12:26:15] <macclearich_> blerf, does anyone know why rebinding a jquery.validator to a form doesn't work?
[12:26:15] <kirbysayshi> kara_sweets: $('form').replaceWith( '<div>Sucess</div>' );
[12:26:34] <anjen> kara you have to use gist or similar right now. nothing comes back when I attempt to view your jsfiddle post
[12:26:35] <kirbysayshi> kara_sweets: if I am understanding what you're asking
[12:27:10] <kara_sweets> ya, that worked, thanks.
[12:27:35] <kara_sweets> how would you add a slidetoggle sort of pop up?
[12:28:39] <ch3mi0n> ag4ve, no I haven't ;)
[12:29:05] <ag4ve> i'm trying to use dyve's autocomplete library. however when i include the queryParamName method, it makes a totaly different get request from the form than without it
[12:29:12] <dibs> what is invalid about this: options[] = $(this).clone();  I'm itterating over options in a select list when it's called??
[12:30:16] <ch3mi0n> ?p @ dibs
[12:30:17] <bot-t> dibs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:30:22] <dddbmt> Is it possible to store an instance of Date() in a "data" attribute on an element? like $('<div/>').data('date', new Date())
[12:30:52] <dibs> oops, sorry
[12:31:09] <ch3mi0n> dddbmt, yes, it should end up as a very long string which you can later parse with Date
[12:31:20] <dibs> ch3mi0n: can you tell me how to clone to a var though?
[12:31:59] <ch3mi0n> To store a cloned jquery object as a var, I usually do $clone = $('#whatever').clone()
[12:32:00] <dddbmt> ch3mi0n, ah yeah of course - I can parse it with back to object with Date()! I had managed to get i into a string on the element, but needed the object ;)
[12:32:01] <dddbmt> thanks
[12:32:13] <ch3mi0n> Then you can do $clone.jQueryMethod()
[12:32:35] <ch3mi0n> Without having to do $($clone).jQueryMethod()
[12:32:50] <ch3mi0n> dddbmt, np
[12:32:52] <dibs> can it not just be a regular var
[12:33:00] <lar_zzz> dibs: options.push($(this).clone());
[12:33:10] <ch3mi0n> dibs, all vars are "regular vars"
[12:33:11] <dibs> lar_zzz: chur! thanks
[12:33:54] <lar_zzz> dibs: when options is type of array
[12:33:55] <ch3mi0n> lar_zzz, dibs, technically $clone = $('#whatever').clone() would be an array
[12:34:33] <ch3mi0n> It would be an array containing that DOM object
[12:34:34] <lar_zzz> chrmi0n: you mean a jQuery Collection?
[12:34:39] <dibs> ch3mi0n: really? is $var a way of making an array like without push etc?
[12:35:19] <ch3mi0n> lar_zzz, hence "technically". It's still an array
[12:35:55] <ch3mi0n> dibs, the $ has nothing to do with it, $ is treated like any alpha character in a var name (like _ is)
[12:36:14] <ch3mi0n> I just prepend jQuery object vars with $ to help identify them
[12:36:22] <ch3mi0n> Personal preference
[12:36:27] <dibs> ok
[12:36:39] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[12:36:42] <SinnerNyx> if I hide an element that has a click event, and then show it later, will that click event be compromised in any way?
[12:36:44] <zatan> Hi, for example I have got $(this).addClasss      $(this) is a "li" tag, but I want to add in to next tag "a"  how can I do that ?

[12:37:26] <bot-t> zatan, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:37:29] <brondsem> nvm, its back
[12:38:42] <SinnerNyx> or if i unbind a click event on a parent element will all the children elements lose the click event as well?
[12:38:43] <pilgrim> Can I set .data() on a text node? If not, how can I set data on a text node?
[12:39:12] <ch3mi0n> ?tias SinnerNyx
[12:39:13] <bot-t> ch3mi0n, Couldn't find "tias SinnerNyx" in jQuery Docs.
[12:39:13] <SinnerNyx> pilgrim: I think the answer to that is no you can't. And you can't.
[12:39:18] <ch3mi0n> ?tias @ SinnerNyx
[12:39:18] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, Try It And See
[12:39:43] <SinnerNyx> ch3mi0n: I did. It's not working. I'm not sure if it's because of a behaviour i'm not understanding. it makes no sense to me. and so I'm asking
[12:40:22] <ch3mi0n> SinnerNyx, if it's not working, I suggest making a deep clone of the object, then remove it (rather than hide) and then add it back into the DOM when you're ready
[12:40:27] <ch3mi0n> ?clone @ SinnerNyx
[12:40:27] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:40:52] <ch3mi0n> make withDataAndEvents = true and you have a deep clone
[12:42:00] <SinnerNyx> ch3mi0n: so then an elements visibility can 'damage' it's event handler bindings?
[12:42:33] <Jon47>  SinnerNyx - no
[12:42:44] <zatan> Kambfhase, its not helping http://jsfiddle.net/nwgGT/
[12:42:53] <Jon47> if you do a deep clone then the events are copied along with the element
[12:43:12] <Kambfhase> ?find @ zatan
[12:43:12] <bot-t> zatan, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:43:14] <Jon47> css visibility has nothing inherently to do with the event model
[12:43:38] <pilgrim> If I have a jquery object with elements(?), how can I see if another object is inside it?
[12:43:43] <zatan> Kambfhase,  thank u :)
[12:43:49] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:43:58] <macclearich_> anyone got any notions on a jquery validator re-binding question?
[12:44:24] <SinnerNyx> Jon47: right, I stopped the 'hide' code from operating in my code, and now it's still not working. I'm not understanding this but somehow my event is getting unbound.
[12:44:48] <SinnerNyx> is there any way to list all event functions bound to an event of an element at any given point in time?
[12:45:55] <Jon47> SinnerNyx indeed, i believe jquery stores this info in the "events" data property
[12:46:09] <Jon47> e.g. $myElement.data('events')
[12:48:43] <Jon47> that's probably considered a jquery internal though, so i wouldn't recommend mucking with it ;)
[12:51:02] <SinnerNyx> Jon47: wasn't planning on it. However I'm trying to see at what point the event disappears. its very frustrating. the event data doesn't appear to ever exist. even right after calling element.bind. On other elements the 'event' data is there, but not for this one. for this element the event then gets triggered once and never again...
[12:51:57] <Jon47> SinnerNyx:  are you sure the element exists when you're trying to bind the handler?
[12:53:14] <brian-c> My relatively simple looped animation pegs the processor every time. Anything obvious I should look at?
[12:53:17] <SinnerNyx> hmm hang on now. The element does exist (in that there is a var el=$(document.createElement('a')) before the bind call). Does the element have to be attached to a parent node before I can bind events to it?
[12:53:27] <SinnerNyx> Jon47: ^^
[12:53:50] <mdiamond> hey, could anyone give me a definitive answer on how jQuery expects users to use "ifModified"
[12:54:14] <mdiamond> because our project uses ifModified globally and expects that we will be able to retrieve a cached value if the response is 304 Not Modified
[12:54:27] <mdiamond> but I'm beginning to suspect that this is not how "ifModified" was designed
[12:54:59] <mdiamond> since jQuery is in charge of retrieving/storing/returning the Etag value
[12:55:09] <mdiamond> but makes no guarantees as to the presence of the data in the browser cache
[12:55:27] <mdiamond> as opposed to a scenario where the browser sends an Etag value based on knowledge of the cache contents
[12:55:58] <mdiamond> should we not use ifModified if we're relying on browser-cached results?
[12:56:23] <Jon47> SinnerNyx: you can bind handlers to elements that are detached from teh DOM but your method of creating an element will yield an HTMLElement object, not a jquery object… so you probably can't run jquery methods like .bind on it
[12:56:44] <Jon47> oh wait, you got it wrapped in the $()..
[12:57:08] <Jon47> try just doing $('<a>')
[12:57:14] <SinnerNyx> ok
[12:57:59] <danzik17> mdiamond: correct.  it states straight in the docs that ifModified will only allow responses that have changes ti be successful.
[12:58:36] <SinnerNyx> Jon47: no joy
[12:59:18] <mdiamond> danzik17: yeah, I noticed that… but even that definition is confusing, because a 304 Not Modified WILL trigger the "success" handler with "data" as undefined
[13:00:22] <Jon47> sinnernyx ack, well, i gotta run
[13:00:28] <Jon47> best of luck sir
[13:01:05] <SinnerNyx> Jon47: thanks for your time. have a good one
[13:01:35] <xp_prg> in chrome developer tools how do I turn off a css rule?
[13:01:43] <danzik17> mdiamond: it does seem confusing - not sure exactly what use case it's for.  if it does call success AND the XHR was returned 304 because of either an eTag or Last-Modified header, then that seems like a bug.
[13:02:06] <danzik17> or at least, a docs fail.
[13:02:31] <mdiamond> danzik17: maybe a docs fail… the source code makes it pretty explicit that a 304 should call the success handler
[13:03:17] <mdiamond> danzik17: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L533
[13:03:28] <mdiamond> that's the logic that handles 304s
[13:03:49] <mdiamond> I suppose it makes sense though
[13:03:57] <mdiamond> I mean… if it's a 304, that's not really an "error" per se
[13:04:08] <mdiamond> so I understand that they'd pass it through the success handler
[13:04:16] <mdiamond> I was just making the assumption that we could count on the cached data being available
[13:04:21] <mdiamond> but I suppose that's not the intended use of ifModified
[13:04:43] <mdiamond> or at least, jQuery assumes our code will bear the responsibility of caching the data somewhere
[13:04:59] <xp_prg> hello can anyone help me?
[13:05:16] <astropirate> xp_prg: maybe.. maybe not
[13:05:16] <mdiamond> xp_prg: did you try unchecking the checkbox next to the rule?
[13:05:38] <nek4life_> Anyone know of a way to override a global ajaxPrefilter?
[13:06:19] <dilvie> xp_prg: all the css rules in the css sidebar are editable (you can see the css sidebar on the elements tab). You can set them to null, check or uncheck them, or even add new rules.
[13:06:50] <xp_prg> that is weird because it only shows checkboxes on certain rows
[13:07:37] <danzik17> mdiamond: i'd say docs fail.  it looks like all ifModified does is append the appropriate headers if it has cached values from a previous ajax call.
[13:08:02] <mdiamond> danzik17: yeah, and it also doesn't populate the "data" parameter in the success callback
[13:08:03] <xp_prg> any of the gray rows do not give me any checkboxes for disable/enabling the css rules
[13:08:15] <PhanLord1> is there some easy framework plugin to help build some picker style controls ?
[13:08:19] <mdiamond> danzik17: which seemed like a bug to me at first but now I'm realizing that it's just because it can't guarantee there's any data to populate
[13:08:35] <jeffsmykil> PhanLord1: picker style?
[13:08:46] <jeffsmykil> PhanLord1: like color picker or what>
[13:08:50] <mdiamond> danzik17: but yeah, ifModified just means jQuery saves and sends back e-tag/last-modified headers
[13:09:22] <PhanLord1> well i would like to get a small popup that looks like date picke for example and has couple input fields
[13:09:52] <jeffsmykil> i would use bootstrap and roll your own
[13:10:06] <jeffsmykil> or you could use jquery ui modal dialogs
[13:12:22] <SinnerNyx> when i use .remove() on an element does it unbind all events associated with the element?
[13:12:24] <PhanLord1> modal dialogs are just dont look same and integrated as datetiem picker does for example
[13:13:09] <SinnerNyx> uh huh. i just found it in the docs
[13:13:16] <SinnerNyx> sweet. i found the source of my problems
[13:13:27] <SinnerNyx> thanks to those who patiently helped me
[13:13:40] <kara_sweets> $('form').replaceWith( '<div>Sucess</div>' ), how would you add slideToggle to this, so that the new div appears slowly?
[13:16:02] <Chopps> hey guys is there any jquery lib or function that allow users to display fancy alerts or dialog boxes?
[13:16:29] <Kambfhase> kara_sweets: var div = $('<div>Success</div>').hide(); $('form').replaceWith( div); div.slideDown();
[13:18:35] <mdiamond> danzik17: anyway thanks for your help, hopefully this gets clarified in the future
[13:23:31] <jmcantrell> hi, i'm trying to figure out how to fade out some text, change it, and then fade it back in... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/548571
[13:24:43] <jmcantrell> the way it appears is that it changes the text, then fades out and back in
[13:25:38] <Kambfhase> jmcantrell: .fadeOut( [duration] [, callback] ) << use the callback. it is executed after the element got hidden
[13:25:39] <mdiamond> jmcantrell: jQuery effects are asynchronous
[13:25:45] <mdiamond> yep
[13:26:07] <jmcantrell> gotcha
[13:28:02] <jmcantrell> Kambfhase: like this?... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/548574
[13:28:36] <jmcantrell> it seems to work ok, but when the page initially loads, the text does not fade in, it just appears, and then it works correctly after
[13:28:46] <Kambfhase> you might want to move the if-block into the inner function too, but yyeah.
[13:29:17] <Kambfhase> well you can always trigger .fadeIn() after document.ready
[13:30:13] <jmcantrell> Kambfhase: i guess i just don't understand why it behaves that way

[13:40:16] <FrameFever> but damn, firefox with bugzilla crashes very often
[13:40:27] <FrameFever> is my programming so bad? :D
[13:41:08] <Kambfhase> check your code at: http://jshint.com/
[13:42:45] <FrameFever> ohh I didnt know that I have to use semicolon
[13:43:11] <Kambfhase> do your self a favour and learn javascript!
[13:43:58] <FrameFever> I am die trying
[13:44:17] <FrameFever> but as far as I know, its not a must to use semicolons
[13:46:22] <Kambfhase> its not a must to wear a helmet when riding a bike either. But when you write JS you are riding a bike on a high wire in a vulcano.
[13:48:22] <jeffsmykil> with dinosaurs inside?

[13:57:16] <ajpiano> sparuvu: .then( function( job, search, list ) { }) should work, i think
[13:57:44] <sparuvu> yeah you are right but I dont know the number of items in the array I pass to it
[13:57:58] <sparuvu> sometimes its only 3 but sometimes it will be just 1
[13:58:03] <ajpiano> you can iterate over the arguments
[13:58:07] <xp_prg> I am confused about something, can you add style stuff after <head> </head> has been created?
[13:58:28] <sparuvu> you mean inside the $.then ???
[13:58:37] <xp_prg> no just html in general
[13:58:56] <sparuvu> its not working I tried
[13:59:01] <xp_prg> for example <body> <stytle> div.my_class { font-weight: bold } ,/stytle>

[14:00:32] <Kambfhase> +not + not +not?
[14:00:33] <sparuvu> ajpiano:   any thoughts ??
[14:00:51] <ajpiano> sparuvu: iterating over arguments isn't working?
[14:00:53] <xp_prg> because I thought all style stuff had to go inside of <head></head>
[14:00:58] <xp_prg> is that not true?
[14:01:02] <sparuvu> yeah…..
[14:01:15] <Kambfhase> it doesnt _have_ to go there, but it _should_
[14:01:54] <xp_prg> if javascript uses certain things in the style should the style be defined before the javascript?
[14:01:57] <ajpiano> sparuvu: i'm kinda swamped at the moment
[14:02:02] <sparuvu> I think the response is being picked from the $.deferred.resolve(response) directly from individual ajax calls
[14:02:05] <ajpiano> xp_prg: css always should be loaded before jquery
[14:02:24] <xp_prg> but will it cause jquery to not work right or is the browser smart enough?
[14:02:25] <sparuvu> ajpiano: np byt thanks for helping me
[14:02:27] <sparuvu> :)

[14:47:33] <NightSparkle> tuibm: not to prevent them from typing them, but you could make it so they have to select from the list

[14:49:22] <Zzaichik> DerekPioneer: that looks fine.. all except the closing img tag <- no no

[15:13:30] <imsky> David_Bradbury: why not just create a DOM object and check it?
[15:13:56] <David_Bradbury> imsky: I can, it just seems a bit of a hack
[15:14:13] <imsky> David_Bradbury: and parsing css isn't? ;)
[15:14:51] <David_Bradbury> Fair enough, but you'd think that would be available somewhere
[15:17:35] <tuibm> NightSparkle: can u help me to do it? this is my code: http://pastebin.com/gC4QSMfz  the request give me a data with 2 values (name and id) the name value is for the autocomplete field; another thing i want to do is to pass the id of the chosen name to a variable to use it later and i dont know how :/
[15:18:28] <imsky> David_Bradbury: if you don't care about being too cross-browser, you can focus on specific document stylesheets
[15:18:36] <nFFF> David_Bradbury seems a bit crazy
[15:19:05] <David_Bradbury> imsky: Meh, I'm alright with creating an object.
[15:19:10] <David_Bradbury> nFFF: Hah, why is that?
[15:19:24] <nFFF> What are you trying to achieve?
[15:19:31] <nFFF> I mean do you not control the css?
[15:20:31] <David_Bradbury> nFFF: I do, I'm just using a button to check the display status of a class
[15:21:26] <nFFF> but the class isn't assigned to any element in the DOM?
[15:21:31] <David_Bradbury> Nope
[15:21:47] <nFFF> So why do you care about the class?
[15:21:47] <Hopsy> vladikoff: oksoclap is offline =o
[15:21:59] <nFFF> Im just curious to whats happening :D
[15:22:12] <David_Bradbury> Because it will be there based depending on the status of the user's project
[15:22:31] <David_Bradbury> A user who hasn't completed anything won't have that class applied anywhere
[15:25:43] <nFFF> And if you can define the classes' css why do you need to check it's display property/
[15:26:36] <David_Bradbury> Because inside of the page, the user can complete something and then the class can be added or removed
[15:26:52] <nFFF> ok
[15:27:09] <nFFF> But why do you need to check the css property?
[15:27:17] <nFFF> Cant you just search the DOM for the class?
[15:27:31] <nFFF> .addClass() to show it and removeClass() to remove it?
[15:30:23] <tuibm> NightSparkle:still there??
[15:30:56] <nFFF> David_Bradbury ?? :<
[15:31:10] <David_Bradbury> The button acts as a filter that will .slideUp() / .slideDown() everything that has that class. I don't know if anything has that class or not
[15:31:18] <NightSparkle> tuibm: hang on, I'm at work right now
[15:31:24] <David_Bradbury> There may be one thing that has it, 50, or 0
[15:32:00] <David_Bradbury> I guess I could do $("*").hasClass()
[15:32:08] <David_Bradbury> Or whatever
[15:32:13] <nFFF> Sure, but I don't understand why you'd need to check it's display property when not assigned to the DOM,
[15:32:23] <nFFF> $('.class')
[15:32:25] <yedimind> davidwhat ?
[15:32:34] <yedimind> if you're just looking for anything that has that class...
[15:32:38] <yedimind> then $('.thatclass') ....
[15:32:53] <yedimind> David_Bradbury, ^
[15:33:08] <David_Bradbury> I don't know if the class exists or not though
[15:33:14] <nFFF> Exacly
[15:33:15] <David_Bradbury> I want to handle it two different ways if the class exists or doesn't exist
[15:33:22] <nFFF> Ok
[15:33:25] <tuibm> NightSparkle: ok, sorry :)
[15:33:29] <yedimind> if it doesnt exist, then it wont be part of that object
[15:34:02] <David_Bradbury> So just do $('.classname') and if it returns false, then it doesn't exist, yes?
[15:34:22] <David_Bradbury> Err, or an empty array
[15:34:26] <nFFF> $('class').length
[15:34:28] <nFFF> ?
[15:34:32] <justinhjohnson1> .length <= 0
[15:35:09] <nFFF> if($('class').length > 0 ) //class exists
[15:35:12] <David_Bradbury> Alright, that's cool :), time to get off of work! But thanks for the help :)
[15:35:20] <nFFF> :>
[15:45:53] <idr0p>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:53:28] <chovy> nFFF: isn't there something like if ( $("#foo").hasClass('bar') ) { .. }
[15:53:42] <someprimetime> anyone used backbone.js before?
[15:53:50] <chovy> someprimetime: no.
[15:53:59] <chovy> i was just reading about it yesterday.
[15:54:02] <someprimetime> in here.. that is currently reading the chat
[15:54:08] <someprimetime> chovy: thoughts?
[15:54:40] <NightSparkle> tuibm: You will want to provide a callback for the select event.
[15:55:26] <chovy> someprimetime: i don't know really, it was over my head.
[15:55:37] <chovy> i pretty much stick to jQuery.
[15:55:48] <someprimetime> it's separate from jquery
[15:56:20] <tuibm> NightSparkle: ??? :S
[15:56:28] <someprimetime> it's supposed to make dom data manipulation easier to control
[15:57:19] <chovy> i will probably retire as a jquery expert
[15:57:43] <chovy> assuming it's still around in 30 years :)
[15:57:51] <afidegnum> hello, I am setting hosting space, $30 a year, anyone interrested?
[15:58:05] <chovy> afidegnum: where?
[15:58:27] <GranMal> Is there a shortcut for .parent().parent().parent() assuming that a child of the last parent is being clicked, but you want to affect the great-grandparent?
[15:58:28] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime i have - what's up? just looking for general feedback? in general, it's awesome. i found spine.js an easier "little brother", though.
[15:58:45] <afidegnum> Las-vegas, but site is yet to be ready, if interrested, you can pre-register
[15:58:47] <chovy> GranMal: $("div").parents(".some_class")
[15:58:49] <afidegnum> once ready, I wil linform you
[15:58:53] <someprimetime> c_t_montgomery: yeah basically.. was looking into it for work as i'm doing more dom data manipulation and whatnot
[15:59:04] <someprimetime> and beginning to realize it's going to be hard to manage in the future
[15:59:06] <chovy> GranMal: that will look at ancestors.
[15:59:08] <afidegnum> chovy: it will be ready before the wee end
[15:59:13] <someprimetime> how long did it take you to learn/what's your background coming into it?
[15:59:23] <someprimetime> and what server side technology do you pair it with?
[15:59:40] <NightSparkle> tuibm: jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete  if you look at the events, there is a select event that fires when someone selects an item from the autocomplete list
[15:59:57] <GranMal> chovy: Thanks!
[16:00:02] <afidegnum> chovy:  pm if interrested, I am looking for somone who can maket my hosting services as well
[16:00:02] <chovy> afidegnum: why did you ask if we can't even act?
[16:00:03] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime: rails. here are some resources: http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-resources-for-Backbone-js
[16:00:21] <afidegnum> it's a monthly subscription,
[16:00:23] <someprimetime> someone sent me to http://backbonescreencasts.com/
[16:00:26] <someprimetime> worth purchasing you think?
[16:00:30] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime: and if you happen to use rails w/ it: http://railscasts.com/episodes/323-backbone-on-rails-part-1
[16:00:37] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime: i actually purchased that and it was great
[16:00:43] <c_t_montgomery> so yes - i recommend it
[16:00:45] <nFFF> chovy, sure but that'd be dependant on using an id,  it could have existed on upto 50 elements he said
[16:00:51] <someprimetime> c_t_montgomery: thanks i'm coming from a cakephp/pylons background. never used rails
[16:00:57] <nFFF> Im sure .length would be the easiest/quickest way
[16:00:59] <someprimetime> cool thanks, i'll do the same
[16:01:16] <someprimetime> what would you say the benefits are of backbone to spine?
[16:01:20] <someprimetime> or vice versa
[16:02:18] <chovy> nFFF: i see. you don't have a specific element in mind, you just want to know how many exist anywhere in the DOM?
[16:03:01] <chovy> someprimetime: #backbonejs #spinejs
[16:03:22] <someprimetime> yeah i was in backbonejs there were uh like 6 people in there
[16:03:29] <nFFF> chovy, not me some other guy
[16:03:37] <chovy> nFFF: i see.
[16:03:37] <tuibm> NightSparkle: Oh yes.. i see it...
[16:03:43] <nFFF> wanted to see if a class existed on the page
[16:04:01] <nFFF> $('class').length is the fastest method I know
[16:04:13] <chovy> yeah. that's the way i would do it.
[16:07:47] <wasabi> Howdy. Trying to come up with a decent way to synchronize the column widths between two like-tables.
[16:09:17] <someprimetime> synchronize?
[16:09:19] <someprimetime> what does that mean
[16:09:25] <someprimetime> that's pretty vague
[16:09:28] <nFFF> make the same?
[16:10:02] <nFFF> $('#table1 .col, #table2 .cal').css('width','500px');
[16:10:04] <someprimetime> wasabi: why would you need js to do this?
[16:10:05] <nFFF> ?
[16:10:19] <Eviltwin> I think he means set the one based on the other
[16:10:23] <Eviltwin> Or set them both to the max of the two
[16:10:50] <someprimetime> the former makes more sense
[16:12:03] <someprimetime> could you just do $('#table2').css('width', $('#table1').outerWidth()); ?
[16:12:05] <someprimetime> would that even work?
[16:12:17] <Eviltwin> Why outerWidth?
[16:12:21] <kara_sweets> how would you implement a timeOut to this $('form').replaceWith(function(){return div; }); so that that the div only comes in after some millisenconds?
[16:12:27] <someprimetime> if the table has a border on it
[16:12:42] <recur> anyone familiar with jquery tools slideshow?
[16:12:59] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: You'd animate out the original, replaceWith it, then animate in the new one
[16:13:00] <someprimetime> actually nm that would include margin too, right?
[16:13:03] <someprimetime> so just width()?
[16:13:11] <Eviltwin> Probably just width()
[16:13:54] <wasabi> Because there's no way to do it in CSS? ;0
[16:14:11] <wasabi> Yeah, the widths aren't static.
[16:14:50] <tuibm> NightSparkle: i dont know where or what to put in the function :S
[16:15:10] <nFFF> wasabi, how are they being changed, user or content?
[16:15:16] <wasabi> Okay, let me reask this question from a different angle, so maybe ya'll can help me design thsi better anyways.   I'm trying to write code to nest a set of child tables into a bigger table.
[16:15:35] <wasabi> Said mechanism does not ened to even be a table, but that's what it 'looks like'.
[16:15:42] <wasabi> nFFF: content.
[16:16:02] <nFFF> Eviltwin, is it possible to bind events in jQuery to things like table width changes?
[16:16:23] <Eviltwin> No
[16:16:31] <Eviltwin> But you can bind to window resize
[16:18:49] <wasabi> Hmm.
[16:19:31] <wasabi> Doing actual layout of actual stuff in HTML/CSS is always such a pain. sigh.
[16:19:37] <NightSparkle> tuibm: you can just add to your autocomplete settings - select: function(event, ui) { // get id from ui.item.value and name from ui.item.label }
[16:21:09] <nFFF> wasabi, thing is screens are fixed width
[16:21:25] <nFFF> so not sure having dynamic table colunm widths is a good thing
[16:21:42] <nFFF> probably not the best user experience
[16:25:34] <rasmusth> does anybody know how I can get live or delegate to work with fancybox 2? :)
[16:26:32] <ibodi> coldhead: <div class='abc' title='ttt'></div> ==> $('.abc').append(this.title) got the title of the page instead.
[16:27:18] <ibodi> i guess not : $(this).attr('title')
[16:27:50] <nFFF> ibodi
[16:27:56] <nFFF> what are you trying to do?
[16:28:23] <ibodi> nFFF: i m trying to append the title of class='abc' into div automatically
[16:28:45] <nFFF> as text?
[16:28:51] <ibodi> nFFF: yes.
[16:28:57] <coldhead> this is probably not what you think this is
[16:29:06] <nFFF> .text()?
[16:29:12] <coldhead> mmm, this ambiguity
[16:29:24] <ibodi> nFFF: .text() same.
[16:29:52] <ibodi> coldhead: of course i m simply the situation. i was doing something else :)
[16:30:46] <nFFF> ibodi your code doesn't work?
[16:30:50] <nFFF> $('.abc').each(function() { var t = $(this).attr('title); $(this).text(t); });
[16:30:52] <coldhead> but if this.title === <title> then this === window
[16:30:52] <nFFF> try that
[16:31:10] <nFFF> $('.abc').each(function() { var t = $(this).attr('title'); $(this).text(t); });
[16:31:30] <ibodi> nFFF:  #abc works. i m trying to make it a class, because i might have multiple places.
[16:32:12] <ibodi> nFFF: well. here is the original code : coldhead
[16:32:48] <nFFF> Im confused, your trying to do what? find an element with an id and add a class?
[16:32:55] <chee> imagine you woke up and you were coldhead
[16:34:08] <ibodi> <div id='weblog' title='zzzzz'></div> ::> $('#weblog').append("<iframe src='...?log="+$('#weblog').title+"'>");
[16:34:31] <nFFF> ok got you
[16:34:43] <nFFF> so do what I suggested
[16:35:11] <ibodi> ok. testing ... nFFF
[16:35:28] <nFFF> either use the selector.title() or if you want to use $(this) use .each()
[16:37:01] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/XZ76m/
[16:37:33] <ibodi> nFFF:  is there a .title() ?
[16:38:37] <nFFF> ?
[16:38:47] <nFFF> .attr('title')
[16:38:52] <ibodi> ok
[16:39:20] <nFFF> good luck bed time for me
[16:39:31] <ibodi> :)
[16:47:36] <nathanblogs> is there a way to send a redirect request from php that $.ajax will pickup
[16:47:50] <nathanblogs> without adding some code into the success
[16:48:15] <Eviltwin> XHR transparently follows 3xx responses
[16:48:28] <kara_sweets> has anyone ever added data-transitions to a form in jquery mobile?
[16:48:49] <Eviltwin> I don't know what that means so probably not
[16:51:48] <Lycurgus> are there actual demos/samples for ui outside of those snippets in the documentation?
[16:52:07] <Eviltwin> Lycurgus: Like...?
[16:52:54] <Lycurgus> like something other than 2 or 3 line snippets Eviltwin
[16:53:47] <kara_sweets> do these work for anyone? these examples seem to fail constantly when i try to run them in the browser
[16:53:48] <kara_sweets> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4/docs/pages/docs-transitions.html
[16:54:06] <NightSparkle> Lycurgus: well, in the official documentation, that's what there is
[16:54:17] <Lycurgus> NightSparkle, thx
[16:54:58] <NightSparkle> Lycurgus: You should be able to search around and find other examples out there in the wild world of the internet
[16:55:12] <Lycurgus> no doubt
[16:55:20] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Work fine here
[16:55:59] <nathanblogs> mm
[16:56:04] <nathanblogs> doesn't seem to redirect nicely
[16:56:17] <nathanblogs> it works to redirect the ajax call
[16:56:31] <nathanblogs> but not if you want to redirect the user to a new page
[16:56:40] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Try a WebKit-based browser
[16:59:21] <supertrue> if I am selecting particular 'p', how do I select this p AND all previous p's?
[16:59:42] <Eviltwin> Previous as in previous siblings or previous as in came before in DOM order
[16:59:50] <supertrue> previous siblings
[17:00:05] <supertrue> I know about prevAll, but I don't know how to keep the current selection too
[17:00:30] <Eviltwin> var p = $("p#intersting"); p = p.prevAll("p").add(p);
[17:01:57] <Hierofant> but change "p" to something else :)
[17:02:15] <tuibm> NightSparkle: I can get the id :S im using this: select: function(event, ui) { var fbid = ui.item.label; alert(fbid); } if i put ui.item.label i get the "name" and if i put ui.item.value i get the "name" too... my data is something like this: http://pastebin.com/93JTKN0g
[17:02:30] <nathanblogs> I guess i could handle it with ajaxError
[17:02:36] <tuibm> NightSparkle: "can't" misspelling
[17:02:40] <supertrue> thanks eviltwin. I'm surprised there isn't a way to do it all in one shot
[17:02:44] <Lycurgus> actually I was looking at the snippets with the method/event/whatevers the main samples are closer to what I was looking for
[17:03:01] <Eviltwin> supertrue: I'm not terribly surprised
[17:05:15] <kara_sweets> hey eviltwin, how would you delay the action at the bottom where the form is replaced by a div, for like 200 ms? and then be able to close the div my clicking on it?
[17:05:16] <kara_sweets> http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/E4mz9/
[17:05:48] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[17:05:56] <Eviltwin> Read-only access for now
[17:06:27] <NightSparkle> tuibm: hmm, it doesn't look like you're pushing the id into the source of the autocomplete, only the name
[17:11:17] <woopthereitis> anyone have a good jquery json guide? I am having trouble; the aim is to retrieve JSON and display data in a table
[17:11:47] <Eviltwin> Then what you're really looking for is a AJAX guide
[17:11:49] <tuibm> NightSparkle: :/ i think i was pushing it then i dont know how to push it too
[17:17:24] <NightSparkle> tuibm: well, you can push {value: <your id>, label: <your name>}
[17:21:34] <ag4ve> probably a stupid question but how do i parse html within a string?
[17:23:12] <tuibm> NightSparkle: Sorry, but I do not understand you :S im very new in this...
[17:23:30] <kara_sweets> can anyone decipher where you would but this data-transition attribute in a form?  would it be in the form tag or the submit tag? and if there's no href for an input button, how would that work? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[17:29:41] <NightSparkle> tuibm: Are you doing any sort of server side processing for your source there?  Is there any paricular reason why you're loading it via ajax call?  I'm not sure if I fully understand what you're trying to commplish.
[17:30:54] <tuibm> NightSparkle: yes, im calling the facebook friend list from the user logged into my app (var tokenUrl = "https://graph.facebook.com/me/friends?access_token=" + accessToken + "&callback=?";)
[17:35:00] <TheyCallMeAndy> Hello
[17:35:55] <TheyCallMeAndy> I'm trying to work on my navigation bar, and I've seen some sites where you click on one of the navigation buttons, it doesn't refresh, but goes to a new page. How could i do this?
[17:37:19] <TheyCallMeAndy> Is anyone here?
[17:38:21] <TheyCallMeAndy> I'm trying to work on my navigation bar, and I've seen some sites where you click on one of the navigation buttons, it doesn't refresh, but goes to a new page. How could i do this?
[17:39:19] <TheyCallMeAndy> Nobody here...
[17:39:27] <woopthereitis> you could use javascript and css or ajax lots of ways
[17:39:39] <TheyCallMeAndy> But that doesn't tell me how.
[17:39:41] <TheyCallMeAndy> :3
[17:39:55] <TheyCallMeAndy> I been googling long enough.
[17:40:03] <TheyCallMeAndy> Decided IRC would be best
[17:40:36] <TheyCallMeAndy> Can you show me a pastebin link of what to do?
[17:41:09] <woopthereitis> perhaps this is the google query you seek : change page content without reloading
[17:41:29] <NightSparkle> tuibm: Are you passing the search term to that at alll to filter or is this something that is better to just be loaded once.  Anyhow, I guess that's not really relevant to your original question though
[17:42:05] <TheyCallMeAndy> That might work, I've been wording it like so: "How to use a navigation bar without refreshing"
[17:42:53] <woopthereitis> i would start with a simple test that behaves correctly then apply where needed
[17:43:22] <woopthereitis> if you use css selectors to trigger it should be very easy to modify for a nav bar
[17:44:58] <TheyCallMeAndy> I don't even know, honestly, what you just said.
[17:45:27] <NightSparkle> tuibm: when you are building your source array to pass to the function, you should give it the label and the value. http://pastebin.com/5XTGzzaE
[17:45:27] <TheyCallMeAndy> I'm not an amazing html coder, I am self-taught. Other than tutorials, of course.
[17:46:03] <tuibm> NightSparkle: is better just to be loaded once so i dont need to make a call every time the user type a letter, also it can filter all
[17:46:45] <TheyCallMeAndy> Can you give me a link to a nice tutorial on this?
[17:46:52] <TheyCallMeAndy> whoopthereitis:
[17:47:57] <gao> i'm using the function hide('slide', { direction: 'left' }, 100, CALLBACK() ); is there anyway I can remove the CALLBACK() function?
[17:54:30] <NightSparkle> tuibm: you might want to look at the autocomplete example for XML data parsed once for ideas on hwo to get the data source loaded once and then let the autocomplete plugin do the filtering.  Sorry, but I gotta head home now.
[17:59:55] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what's the diff. between mouseenter/mouseleave and hover?
[18:00:31] <darcyclarke> someprimetime check out http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js and search "hover:"
[18:00:39] <someprimetime> darcyclarke: i did
[18:00:50] <someprimetime> they look the same, but i've found when using one vs. the other they behave differently
[18:00:50] <darcyclarke> so you have your answer
[18:00:53] <someprimetime> as hover is an alias for that
[18:01:12] <someprimetime> that == mouseenter/mouseleave
[18:05:45] <someprimetime> nm i was confusing mouseenter with mouseover
[18:09:23] <LukeNukem> Hi can can someone take a look at line 22 onwards, when that function happens the page is reloading..

[18:40:18] <tomoyuki28jp> For example, when I close a tab when jQuery.ajax is running, I think the jQuery.ajax.error() is called. How can I catch the error?
[18:40:45] <LukeNukem> error console in firefox works i guess
[18:41:28] <tomoyuki28jp> LukeNukem: the tab is closed before I can see the error.
[18:42:34] <LukeNukem> would you know how i can stop refresh of a page?
[18:42:54] <LukeNukem> i tried e.preventDefault(); but it keepsrefresing the page when i remove an html element
[18:43:57] <Vaerros> muzone: haven't watched it

[18:57:30] <zeunix> semi-unrelated but anyone have a clue why the History.js library is returning a dot prepended to every History.getState() call in IE only? e.g. /foo/bar/ returns just that in decent browsers, './foo/bar' in IE (note the period)
[19:04:31] <zeunix> never mind. this is expected behavior for some dumb reason. if anyone knows why let me know.
[19:21:51] <heshanh> i have 4 divs and 2 < / > buttons that navigates through them. only 1 is visible at any given time. the issues is. i need to hide the next button if the last div is visible, and hide the pre button if the first div is visible. any idea how i can do this?
[19:22:44] <heshanh> i managed to get it to work to a point where if someone is already onthe last div and they click next it hides the button
[19:23:26] <Kichael> I've got an ajax call that needs to handle the error case, it seems to do what I ask it to when there is an error, except I get an alert dialog with the error message as well. How do I stop the alert from happening?
[19:23:57] <Vaerros> heshanh: the most recent thing you said sounds really bad
[19:35:09] <heshanh> ol which part?
[19:35:15] <heshanh> the issue or where i got up to fixing it
[19:38:24] <prometh> hi.. i'm convinced that i'm encountering a jquery bug
[19:38:40] <prometh> any core devs around to check out my code?
[19:39:13] <prometh> my code is ~200 lines long, which is why i'm "asking to ask"
[19:51:39] <Kichael> How can I make an ajax error not produce an alert?
[20:06:37] <mansoor-s> Kichael: because it is not an exception
[20:06:53] <mansoor-s> its just an application failure
[20:07:47] <prometh> mansoor-s: could i get you to look at my ~200 lines of code?
[20:08:06] <mansoor-s> prometh: i'm kinda busy atm :(
[20:08:12] <prometh> ok, thx
[20:10:25] <DreamStiffler> hi guys im back
[20:10:41] <DreamStiffler> wondering how do i use .join() . i tried here http://pastebin.com/Bph2aDf5 but failed
[20:24:30] <c_t_montgomery> DreamStiffler are you on line 6, you're resetting checkboxChecked each iteration through the loop. Do you mean to use '+=' instead of '=' ? or what exactly is your problem?
[20:32:13] <abjorn> imsky mah nigga
[20:32:14] <bot-t1> (32 hours 2 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn busy week bro, i'm still around
[20:32:29] <imsky> abjorn mah wigga
[20:33:24] <abjorn> know any good plugin/shiv for <input type="number">?
[20:33:33] <imsky> let me see
[20:33:38] <imsky> ?g does bot-t work
[20:33:40] <bot-t1> imsky, Wikipedia:Bot policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_policy
[20:33:42] <imsky> yes
[20:33:50] <abjorn> project I'm working on at work is using an input field like that, but that shit don't werk on firefox
[20:33:57] <imsky> ?g html5 polyfill OR shim OR shiv number input

[20:34:10] <prometh> anyone ever have an issue with using an on() after an animate() ?
[20:34:18] <prometh> my animation gets cancelled in some instances
[20:35:04] <abjorn> nice
[20:35:12] <abjorn> that'll make derek happy, i think
[20:35:24] <abjorn> looks like the arrow buttons can be styled easily enough
[20:35:58] <imsky> yessir. tbh it might be a little early to be doing html5 forms
[20:36:06] <imsky> give it a few years
[20:36:07] <abjorn> well
[20:36:22] <abjorn> this project is internal, and there are only two browsers I need to support
[20:36:35] <abjorn> chrome (15 atm, but support for all this is the same either way)
[20:36:41] <abjorn> and firefox...uhm, 7
[20:36:55] <abjorn> mostly firefox
[20:37:04] <imsky> aw firefox
[20:37:08] <imsky> aww
[20:37:13] <abjorn> I'm going to need an input field like that either way, so might as well use something that exists, and use the native browser version when available
[20:37:27] <imsky> workin smart, not workin hard
[20:37:31] <abjorn> lol
[20:37:50] <abjorn> tbh I'll probably just gut the number part from this
[20:37:58] <abjorn> I don't need anything else
[20:38:07] <imsky> what's the number input do again
[20:38:25] <abjorn> only allows numbers, and has the up and down buttans
[20:38:36] <abjorn> you can limit what numbers, increment, etc
[20:38:42] <imsky> god what a piece of crap
[20:38:49] <abjorn> lol
[20:38:59] <abjorn> why do you say that?
[20:39:01] <mweichert> hi, is there a "go to" libray for generating beautiful forms with JS validation?
[20:39:14] <imsky> i dunno, who cares about number inputs lol
[20:39:17] <imsky> might as well make it a slider
[20:39:25] <imsky> it'd look cooler and jquery ui's got support
[20:39:25] <prometh> sliders take up too much space
[20:39:39] <abjorn> imsky: Not my decision, unfortunately
[20:39:39] <imsky> shit i didn't know you were listening to our conversation
[20:39:44] <abjorn> lol
[20:39:46] <prometh> i am
[20:39:51] <abjorn> yeah and the space where it's going, there's no room for a slider
[20:40:01] <imsky> what's it for
[20:40:02] <abjorn> mweichert: I wouldn't say "go to", no
[20:40:19] <imsky> mweichert: i'll write you one for a reasonable fee
[20:40:29] <abjorn> it doesn't have validation, but formalize is really good for making nice looking forms that look the same across all browsers
[20:40:39] <abjorn> then validation...no need to have a plugin
[20:40:49] <abjorn> writing validation javascript takes like 5 seconds
[20:41:22] <imsky> oh yeah

[20:58:02] <imsky> holy god what is this
[20:58:05] <abjorn> LOL
[20:58:07] <ch3mical> lawl
[20:58:21] <imsky> i really considered it for a project

[20:58:45] <abjorn> when we're not using perl
[20:58:45] <imsky> abjorn: ATK can generate jquery from php calls
[20:58:48] <abjorn> or rails
[20:58:53] <ch3mical> Perl!
[20:59:00] <abjorn> imsky: but...but why?
[20:59:15] <imsky> like so: $left->js('click',$right->js()->animate(array('padding-right'=>'+=20px')));
[20:59:33] <imsky> yes that's jquery api ported ever so subtly to a php framework
[20:59:42] <ch3mical> bleh

[21:00:19] <prometh> everything else is bastardization
[21:00:21] * imsky sit's
[21:00:28] <imsky> prometh: my thoughts exactly
[21:00:33] <imsky> stop bundling jquery in you idiots
[21:00:42] <imsky> so much for yii
[21:00:45] <abjorn> imsky: Well, php homos will tell you it's for nubs. But that's the brilliant thing about it - it keeps you from writing fucking php
[21:00:55] <imsky> abjorn: i write php just fine kthx
[21:01:03] <prometh> i like php
[21:01:03] <abjorn> even if you write php just fine
[21:01:10] <abjorn> it keeps you from having to write much
[21:01:14] <abjorn> which is real fuckin dandy
[21:01:18] <imsky> php homos are better homos than goddamn rails homos

[21:03:49] <imsky> i don't even think about practical jokes like coffeescript
[21:03:54] <ch3mical> lol
[21:04:01] <imsky> yeah i guess they're gonna be doing node+haml+less+coffee
[21:04:03] <ch3mical> And SASS
[21:04:04] <prometh> milk + sugar?
[21:04:06] <imsky> FULL STACK WEB DOV
[21:04:07] <ch3mical> or Less
[21:04:16] <abjorn> imsky: oh our whole team is gaga over node
[21:04:18] <abjorn> myself included
[21:04:20] <abjorn> except
[21:04:23] <abjorn> the department director
[21:04:28] <abjorn> who won't let us use it
[21:04:30] <imsky> abjorn: austin, representing third coast baby
[21:04:33] <abjorn> for good reason, i can see why
[21:04:50] <abjorn> I have no objects to not using it in production stuff that our entire support system relies on
[21:04:52] <ch3mical> abjorn: that's why you don't tell the higher ups the details
[21:05:00] <abjorn> lol it doesn't work that way
[21:05:10] <imsky> ch3mical is unemployed
[21:05:23] <ch3mical> Actually, no
[21:05:30] <imsky> oh that's good
[21:05:35] <imsky> surely your bosses appreciate being left in the dark
[21:05:46] <ch3mical> I just have decision making role
[21:06:08] <imsky> wat
[21:06:13] <imsky> i swear one of these days
[21:06:32] <imsky> i'm just going to invent a "slightly irrational" robot as a replacement for all the $50k/year wastes of oxygen with "decision making" roles
[21:06:40] <imsky> SOMETIMES HE MESSES UP
[21:06:45] <imsky> that's why he gets the big bucks
[21:07:03] <Joan> I'm the sassmaster.
[21:07:09] <ch3mical> lol
[21:08:00] <imsky> $b->js('click',$l->js()->reload());
[21:08:19] <imsky> $l is a <p> tag generated by jquery through ATK
[21:08:49] <imsky> if you think about it, if they did this with node, it'd be just as stupid
[21:08:58] <imsky> but people would be like "omg server controls clientside"
[21:09:55] <abjorn> that one guy at yahoo did try to
[21:09:55] <ch3mical> zomg
[21:10:05] <abjorn> rendering yui widgets in node
[21:10:08] <abjorn> and pushing them to the client
[21:10:16] <abjorn> AND WE SEE HOW THAT CAUGHT ON
[21:10:22] <imsky> reimplementing x11 one year at a time
[21:10:30] <abjorn> rofl

[21:11:42] <imsky> ?align
[21:11:53] <pifantastic> no
[21:12:09] <imsky> bot-t is dying a slow digital death
[21:12:10] <imsky> well then
[21:12:17] <imsky> ATK not only writes jquery, it writes CSS too
[21:12:20] <imsky> automagically
[21:13:04] <imsky> style=";float:left"

[21:23:10] <chee> how about a cabinet!
[21:23:13] <imsky> yes
[21:23:19] <imsky> i like this idea very much
[21:23:30] <imsky> god damn i need a php framework that doesn't suck goat balls and fast
[21:23:48] <chee>                 ^
[21:23:52] <chee> hm i missed
[21:24:00] <chee> i counted and everything
[21:24:27] <chee> well let's pretend i pointed a carat at 'php' and at 'goat balls' and get on with our lives
[21:24:45] <imsky> php hate is the true sign of an amateur
[21:24:49] <coldhead> i am editing the logs e'en now
[21:24:55] <abjorn> coldhead
[21:24:56] <abjorn> hi
[21:24:58] <abjorn> hihihi
[21:25:00] <abjorn> hihihihihihihi
[21:25:02] <coldhead> hi abjsy
[21:25:02] <imsky> coldbutt
[21:25:06] <abjorn> coldhod
[21:25:07] <abjorn> caldhad
[21:25:08] <chee> it's abjorn
[21:25:17] <coldhead> the amateur still has their dignity
[21:25:17] <abjorn> SURE IS
[21:25:19] <prometh> hi
[21:25:20] <prometh> again
[21:25:22] <chee> hi prometh
[21:25:27] * abjorn wiggles
[21:25:28] <chee> 1st time 4 me
[21:25:37] <imsky> coldhead: no way. being a php expert is way more satisfying than being a nerd at some OCD language like python
[21:25:38] * imsky wiggles
[21:25:54] <coldhead> being an PHP expert means that a precious part of you has died
[21:25:56] <prometh> say i have multiple items selected and a complete function is created, would it be possible to have that function only applied to the last item in the list?
[21:26:07] <pifantastic> OXYMORON
[21:26:10] <pifantastic> is what that is
[21:26:14] <coldhead> what does create_function return in PHP?
[21:26:17] <imsky> coldhead: or that you actually figured out how to scale without EC2, using real technology
[21:26:22] <coldhead> it returns A STRING
[21:26:24] <coldhead> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[21:26:26] <coldhead> strings
[21:26:28] <chee> hahahaa
[21:26:36] <prometh> $("ul>li").animate( ... , function(){alert("hi")} );
[21:26:39] <imsky> coldhead: you're not up to date are you lol. 5.3 doesn't have create_function
[21:26:42] <chee> the funniest bit is when coldhead laughs at it again
[21:26:45] <pifantastic> imsky: wat
[21:26:51] <prometh> possible to have that function only applied to the last <li> ?
[21:26:52] <imsky> s/have/use/
[21:27:05] <prometh> or must i create a separate procedure?
[21:27:06] <imsky> prometh: yes obviously
[21:27:07] <coldhead> wow, php has lambdas at last! then let the years of tarnish been forgetten!
[21:27:14] <imsky> coldhead: that's what i've been saying
[21:27:18] <imsky> php is finally not retarded
[21:27:22] <imsky> all your snickering is in vain
[21:27:38] <coldhead> right, so when hitler recanted on his deathbed ALL THE JEWS CAME BACK TO LIFE
[21:27:42] <coldhead> is what you're saying
[21:27:43] <chee> php is better than eating glass with your penis
[21:27:45] <imsky> hitler shot himself
[21:27:49] <imsky> or something
[21:27:53] <coldhead> maybe in a bed
[21:27:55] <imsky> no
[21:28:02] <prometh> dogs poop on hitler's grave
[21:28:02] <chee> he blew up with a gurnad
[21:28:03] <imsky> you're thinking of hitler in wolfeinstein 3d
[21:28:06] <coldhead> the important thing is groucho marx did the charleston on his bunker
[21:28:07] <prometh> he's buried in a park
[21:28:09] <coldhead> after the war
[21:28:15] <imsky> coldhead: i do the charleston on ruby on rails
[21:28:39] <imsky> you ever...hate a framework?
[21:28:44] <coldhead> well i respect anyone with expertise in any language, to be perfectly francis
[21:28:51] <coldhead> i've never coded anything in anything
[21:28:54] <prometh> imsky: you say "of course", well ..
[21:28:54] <imsky> coldhead: just to cover up your lack of expertise in anything
[21:28:58] <coldhead> i just like the geek culture
[21:28:58] <imsky> coldhead: beat me to it
[21:28:59] <coldhead> star trek &c.
[21:29:02] <imsky> prometh: :last
[21:29:12] <prometh> but i need all <li>'s to animate
[21:29:18] <imsky> prometh: wat lol
[21:29:18] <prometh> only the :last should have the function, though
[21:29:24] <imsky> ok so use .index
[21:29:25] <prometh> $("ul>li").animate( ... , function(){alert("hi")} );
[21:29:26] <prometh> possible to have that function only applied to the last <li> ?
[21:29:29] <prometh> index?
[21:29:31] <imsky> yes
[21:29:31] * prometh reads
[21:29:32] <imsky> index
[21:29:37] <imsky> if coldhead would turn on bot-t
[21:29:38] <prometh> index?
[21:29:41] <imsky> i could help this gentleman
[21:29:48] <bot-chee>  go
[21:29:52] <imsky> but no, he's doing the charleston on walt disney's grave
[21:30:03] <imsky> lol bot-chee
[21:30:25] <imsky> if you say "hi bot-chee"
[21:30:26] <pifantastic> bot-chee: tell bot-t I want him back
[21:30:27] <bot-chee> how can i be of service
[21:30:28] <imsky> it sounds like hibachi
[21:30:42] <bot-chee> pifantastic: Okay
[21:30:53] <abjorn> Hello, welcome to HostGator Live Chat, my name is Corey, what can I do for you today?
[21:30:55] <abjorn> oh sorry
[21:30:58] <abjorn> wrong kind of automated responses
[21:31:01] <coldhead> the difficulty with searching for chee in the logs is the many spurious references to cheese
[21:31:11] <imsky> HELLO PLS SIR FIX MY WEBSIGHTS NOW PLS THANKS YOU
[21:31:13] <bot-chee> coldhead: but the good thing is
[21:31:18] <coldhead> cheese?
[21:31:23] <bot-chee> coldhead: the many spurious references to cheerleaders
[21:31:27] <imsky> coldhead: you're a goddamn nub
[21:31:32] <coldhead> hahhaha
[21:31:37] <coldhead> imsky: no question
[21:31:41] <imsky> no seriously
[21:31:50] <imsky> how can you not figure out how to search for "chee"
[21:31:57] <coldhead> i am venerabilis inceptor
[21:31:57] <imsky> in your own logs
[21:31:59] <dekub> prometh: try $("ul>li:last").animate( ... , function(){alert("hi")} );
[21:32:02] <coldhead> oh i use regular expressions
[21:32:07] <imsky> dekub: you're like 2 minutes late
[21:32:14] <imsky> coldhead: oh ok, you just like swinging your dick
[21:32:14] <xxiao> when will the plugin be back?
[21:32:15] <prometh> dekub: but i need all elements to animate
[21:32:23] <prometh> and want to keep with anon function
[21:32:29] <xxiao> need update timers and dataFormat, still nowhere to find
[21:32:29] <prometh> so, i guess i'll have to put an index() check in the function?
[21:32:30] <chee> i thought for the best speed you wanted to use .filter(':last')
[21:32:31] <imsky> text processing = true measure of software engineer
[21:32:41] <chee> that's what i thought
[21:32:49] <chee> but i only read the api so i don
[21:32:50] <chee> *dno
[21:32:57] <imsky> nod?
[21:33:00] <chee> nod
[21:33:08] <imsky> wickedy beats
[21:33:20] <coldhead> you are filled with certainties, imsky
[21:33:24] <chee> i am going to return to this party now. i don't really want to because they are all awful human beings
[21:33:28] <imsky> i'm a certainty machine
[21:33:37] <imsky> chee you're in hong kong aren't you
[21:33:39] <coldhead> the halting problem recoils from you
[21:33:46] <imsky> surrounded by money hungry transsexuals
[21:33:55] <xxiao> a update for plugin site without backup still shocks me
[21:33:55] <imsky> coldhead: omg you read wikipedia's "turing" article too?
[21:34:12] <xxiao> it's too stupid to be true
[21:34:34] <imsky> xxiao: what the hell are you talking about
[21:35:23] <xxiao> you know what i am talking about
[21:35:32] <imsky> no
[21:35:37] <imsky> i live in the real world
[21:35:42] <imsky> not in the insane asylum that you do
[21:35:55] <prometh> hey, insane asylum's are cool
[21:36:00] <coldhead> i read GEB, imsky
[21:36:05] <coldhead> wikipedia is too high level
[21:36:09] <coldhead> i need pics
[21:36:20] <imsky> coldhead: i have a strong urge to call you stupid
[21:36:29] <prometh> ever seen "the island"?
[21:36:40] <coldhead> i wouldn't mind
[21:36:41] <imsky> oh yeah
[21:36:42] <prometh> "nuclear bombs implode before they explode" ... that man was deep
[21:36:47] <coldhead> i breathe through my mouth
[21:36:53] <imsky> prometh: only the ones that implode
[21:37:01] <imsky> coldhead: can't tell if trolling about GEB
[21:37:03] <imsky> gonna let it slide
[21:37:14] <xxiao> firefox 10 dislikes jquery 1.4.x, esp its timers/dataFormat, and i can not upgrade as those plugins are still nowhere to find
[21:37:15] <chee> on't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, I like him just fine

[21:37:59] <chee> imsky: have you ever been on Google's website Google.com
[21:38:08] <imsky> i've been on Google.ca
[21:38:15] <imsky> it's full of wonders
[21:38:17] <chee> what is on that website
[21:38:37] <imsky> apparently just a textbox and the word google
[21:38:41] <imsky> it's very experimental
[21:38:54] <chee> that's the same as Google's website Google.com
[21:39:07] <imsky> by jove you're right chee
[21:39:08] <coldhead> i really have read GEB
[21:39:10] <coldhead> a few times
[21:39:18] <coldhead> still don't get it
[21:39:21] <chee> imsky: did you know that the name Google comes from
[21:39:22] <imsky> coldhead: lol i know the guy who wrote it, AMA
[21:39:23] <chee> the words
[21:39:26] <chee> 'go ogle'
[21:39:27] <imsky> googol?
[21:39:31] <chee> as in 'go and look'
[21:39:39] <imsky> chee: go back to ireland you jerk
[21:41:09] <coldhead> imsky: you know Douglas "R. Stands For Recursive" Hofstadter?
[21:41:19] <prometh> guys, i'm having a real problem with this:     $(something).animate(whatever, function(){ $(something_else).on("anything",wtf) } );  ....  it won't animate with the on() in the callback... if i remove it, it animates fine... WTF?
[21:41:26] <imsky> the douglas is another sentence, coldhead
[21:41:34] <imsky> which happens to be recursive and meta-referential
[21:41:35] <coldhead> ohhh
[21:41:39] <coldhead> i feel bad about his wife
[21:41:43] <imsky> i too
[21:41:48] <imsky> though it was a while ago
[21:41:53] <coldhead> i still feel bad
[21:41:57] <coldhead> i remember when it happened
[21:41:57] <imsky> so..maybe you shouldn't be so creepy
[21:42:21] <coldhead> i am trying to read his book about translation
[21:42:30] <coldhead> but very little of it will execute without syntax errors
[21:42:39] <coldhead> in any of my interpreters :(
[21:42:45] <imsky> you're a tru charmer
[21:42:54] <prometh> huys?
[21:42:59] <prometh> guys too
[21:43:12] <prometh> guys, i'm having a real problem with this:     $(something).animate(whatever, function(){ $(something_else).on("anything",wtf) } );  ....  it won't animate with the on() in the callback... if i remove it, it animates fine... WTF?
[21:43:35] <imsky> probably because the on has a syntax error
[21:43:36] <imsky> stupid
[21:43:43] <prometh> where?
[21:43:49] <imsky> inside the actual .on
[21:43:52] <imsky> the part you leave out
[21:43:56] <prometh> calling that function elsewhere in my code
[21:44:00] <imsky> oh god
[21:44:06] <imsky> i have no time for your shenanigans
[21:44:12] <prometh> k
[21:44:19] <coldhead> nonsense, you have plenty of time
[21:44:28] <imsky> coldhead: you're thinking of yourself
[21:45:23] <prometh> imsky: i haven't left anything out
[21:45:31] <imsky> oh yeah right
[21:45:38] <imsky> i call .on("anything",wtf) all the time
[21:45:44] <prometh> ...
[21:45:46] <imsky> works like a charm
[21:45:48] <coldhead> i am hard at work for social media week tyvm
[21:45:50] <prometh> manual even says that
[21:45:53] <prometh> wtf is a function
[21:46:01] <imsky> damn open source
[21:46:03] <imsky> never works right
[21:46:05] <prometh> ...
[21:46:14] <prometh> then enlighten me
[21:46:39] <imsky> lol?
[21:46:45] <imsky> how much more do i have to say
[21:46:49] <prometh> the truth?
[21:46:50] <imsky> your .on has a syntax error
[21:46:53] <prometh> how so?
[21:46:55] <imsky> somewhere deep inside
[21:47:01] <imsky> and since i can't see your actual source
[21:47:04] <prometh> $("#dataTable tbody tr").on("click", function(event){
[21:47:05] <prometh> 	alert($(this).text());
[21:47:05] <prometh> });
[21:47:07] <prometh> that's from the manual.
[21:47:16] <imsky> oh i see you're a fellow datatables user
[21:47:24] <imsky> they're heaps of fun when they work correctly
[21:47:34] <prometh> great, focus on the on()
[21:47:39] <chee> ahahaha
[21:47:52] <imsky> lol for that kind of bossiness, i'll need to charge a fee
[21:48:12] <prometh> now who's wasting who's time?
[21:48:17] <imsky> you mine
[21:48:21] <prometh> my time is worth infinitely more than yours... because i am awesome
[21:48:26] <imsky> nope, wrong again
[21:48:37] <prometh> you're awesome too? pfft, impossible
[21:48:43] <imsky> awesomely delicious
[21:48:52] <prometh> i dont' want to ever know
[21:49:15] <prometh> anyway, that code i pasted is from teh manual
[21:49:21] <imsky> that's great sport
[21:49:24] <prometh> no different from mine aside from they used an anonymous function
[21:49:51] <prometh> i play irc sports
[21:50:04] <prometh> gotta keep the guns strong
[21:50:06] * prometh kisses guns
[21:50:14] <imsky> that's great, sport
[21:50:22] <prometh> fuck you
[21:50:22] <prometh> i am awesome
[21:50:28] <imsky> awesomely broke
[21:50:37] <prometh> so?
[21:50:39] <prometh> i break shit all teh time
[21:50:57] <imsky> okay
[21:51:03] <prometh> hi
[21:53:13] * prometh pokes imsky with a dildo.
[21:53:33] <imsky> bro this is #jquery, either ask someone else or PM me with payment at the ready
[21:53:58] <prometh> dickie
[21:54:45] <wookiehangover> wow, it just got really fucking weird in here
[21:54:50] <chee> just
[21:54:52] <prometh> $("#dataTable tbody tr").on("click", function(event){
[21:54:53] <prometh> 	alert($(this).text());
[21:54:53] <prometh> });
[21:55:06] <prometh> oops
[21:55:07] <prometh> guys, i'm having a real problem with this:     $(something).animate(whatever, function(){ $(something_else).on("anything",wtf) } );  ....  it won't animate with the on() in the callback... if i remove it, it animates fine... WTF?
[21:55:24] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[21:55:26] <Eviltwin> FFS
[21:55:34] <prometh> ...
[21:55:35] <Eviltwin> Why are you using a .on inside an animation callback?
[21:55:42] <wookiehangover> ?on
[21:55:42] <prometh> is that bad?
[21:55:51] <wookiehangover> it's and event binding
[21:55:56] <Eviltwin> What do you think .on oes?
[21:55:57] <Eviltwin> does*
[21:55:58] <imsky> Eviltwin: don't ask him what happens to the binding once the datatables change pages
[21:56:05] <prometh> on creates an event listener?
[21:56:23] <wookiehangover> yes
[21:56:30] <Eviltwin> So why are you binding that event listener inside an animation callback?
[21:56:34] <wookiehangover> I hate it when bot-t isnt in here
[21:56:40] <prometh> when the animation is complete, it adds events
[21:56:42] <Eviltwin> I hate it when bot-t is here
[21:56:44] <prometh> it's only played once
[21:56:45] <Eviltwin> Dude's an asshole
[21:56:49] <Eviltwin> Always beats me to posting links
[21:56:56] <wookiehangover> prometh: that is a fundamentally unsound premise
[21:56:57] <imsky> And writes sentences capitalized.
[21:57:07] <prometh> wookiehangover: why's that?
[21:57:11] <wookiehangover> I blame temp01
[21:57:16] <prometh> i don't want things to be clickable during animation
[21:57:22] <Eviltwin> So use a flag
[21:57:31] <wookiehangover> or the :animated seletor
[21:57:46] <prometh> fine... but explain to me why it's a bad idea so that i have a deeper understand of the problem
[21:57:54] <wookiehangover> if( $(this).is(':animated') ) { return false; }
[21:58:04] * imsky watches two employed men do free tech support for an idiot
[21:58:09] * imsky enjoys life
[21:58:11] <Eviltwin> var clickable = true; $(...).on(...); ... clickable = false; $(...).animate(..., function() { clickable = true; }); ...
[21:58:16] <prometh> imsky: k, just fuck off now, plz
[21:58:21] <wookiehangover> event bindings typically shoudn't be user initiated
[21:58:24] <imsky> prometh: no u
[21:58:34] <prometh> you're the one talking down to me
[21:58:42] <wookiehangover> imsky: chill out
[21:58:53] <imsky> i'm perfectly calm dude
[21:58:58] <wookiehangover> prometh: its just not a good practice
[21:59:00] <Eviltwin> I'm sorry but if I had to kick two of you, imsky would be the one to stay
[21:59:01] <prometh> assholes can be calm.
[21:59:22] <prometh> wookiehangover: ok, i can accept that.. i know how tow rite code... but i'm actually encountering a problem with my code hwere it will not work correctly
[21:59:24] <imsky> <3 Eviltwin
[21:59:28] <imsky> wish i could capitalize <3
[21:59:30] <prometh> could this be a result of using an on() inside an animation callback?
[21:59:33] <wookiehangover> http://s3.amazonaws.com/gif.ly/gifs/398/original.gif
[21:59:37] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:59:43] <prometh> bad practice doesn't often result in crazy errors like this
[21:59:51] <imsky> hey man there's a beverage here
[22:00:16] <Eviltwin> INFORMATION, MAN!
[22:00:25] <imsky> like you know?
[22:01:29] <prometh> Eviltwin: you would choose him cuz he's here more often... but he'es still being a calm asshole
[22:01:33] <prometh> was, anyway
[22:01:37] <prometh> but i'm sure he'll retort.
[22:01:41] * imsky retorts
[22:01:52] <prometh> +1
[22:01:54] <Eviltwin> "WELL ALLOW ME TO RETORT!"
[22:01:58] <prometh> indeed
[22:02:04] <wookiehangover> http://s3.amazonaws.com/gif.ly/gifs/485/original.gif
[22:02:13] <imsky> that's just like
[22:02:17] <imsky> your opinion man
[22:02:32] <prometh> my opinion matters in this world.
[22:02:41] <prometh> yours.. no... cuz you are not me
[22:02:41] <Eviltwin> What world is that?
[22:02:49] <prometh> irc.
[22:03:12] * prometh farts
[22:03:22] <Eviltwin> Hey, that crossed the line
[22:03:27] <prometh> oh
[22:03:45] <imsky> also dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature
[22:03:48] <imsky> asian american please
[22:04:01] <prometh> not sure where that one came from
[22:04:04] <Eviltwin> I didn't know prometh built the railroads
[22:04:13] <prometh> ya man, got paid well too

[22:07:29] <wookiehangover> boulder has a semi-annual lebowski night at the boulder theater
[22:07:35] <Eviltwin> I would have gone in a bathrobe
[22:07:41] <Eviltwin> Didn't know they were having a costume contest
[22:07:46] <wookiehangover> people wear bathrobes and all they serve is caucasians
[22:07:55] <prometh> that movie sucks
[22:08:02] <wookiehangover> prometh: get out

[22:12:26] <prometh> wtf is that thing?
[22:13:18] <rocketman_> Can anyone help me with this code? I need to find a way to make my main div animate up the full height of another div. http://jsbin.com/ivewah/3/edit
[22:13:25] <rocketman_> That Sloth is cool!
[22:13:30] <prometh> sloth, aye
[22:13:36] <prometh> he looks like he's keeping it real.
[22:16:11] <Eviltwin> rocketman_: Could you maybe slim that down to focus on the real issue?
[22:17:49] <rocketman_> I am trying to slide the #main div on top of the #header div
[22:18:19] <rocketman_> Sorry those are not really links
[22:20:12] <rocketman_> I guess I really want to keep the header div where it is and I want to slide the main div over the top of it, where it will stop at the top of the page.
[22:20:25] <rocketman_> when you click on the work link
[22:20:36] <rocketman_> http://jsbin.com/ivewah/3/edit
[22:21:16] <iateadonut> was hoping someone could help me figure out the prev() or prevAll() function
[22:21:18] <iateadonut> http://pastebin.com/J4WeKZa1
[22:22:00] <prometh> guys, thanks for helping me with my issue.... taking the on() out of the animation callback solved all my issues.... but still WHY would that happen?
[22:22:06] <Eviltwin> iateadonut: http://api.jquery.com/prev http://api.jquery.com/prevAll
[22:22:06] <iateadonut> i'm trying to click 'submit', and make the 'img.timerSpinner' that proceeds it (but is not a sibling, i think) to show();
[22:22:27] <prometh> Eviltwin
[22:22:44] <Eviltwin> prometh: Odds are you had a syntax error somewhere
[22:22:50] <prometh> i didn't though
[22:22:59] <prometh> everyhitng worked indepenently
[22:23:04] <prometh> independently*
[22:23:21] <prometh> so, you're saying that it shouldn't have been as messed up as it was?
[22:23:35] <prometh> (animation didnt' play)
[22:23:51] <iateadonut> but the img is outside the table that submit is in, so it's not a sibling, right?
[22:23:59] <prometh> i'm new to jquery.. not js, thoug
[22:24:17] <prometh> so, things like this... i'd like to know why they happen... this is my first real problem with jquery, though
[22:24:46] <iateadonut> so, do i have to do something like parent().prevAll('img.spinnerThingy')
[22:25:03] <imsky> abjorn: i'm out, later bro
[22:25:51] <abjorn> later
[22:40:36] <prometh> Eviltwin
[22:41:09] <prometh> $
[22:41:48] <siguy> damn you jsfiddle!
[22:42:01] <siguy> andbody know of an alternative service?
[22:42:34] <siguy> I could really use some help but I have no consise way of showing what's going on
[22:43:10] <prometh> any jquery experts here? i mean expert.
[22:43:22] <iateadonut> no
[22:43:25] <Eviltwin> prometh: Don't PM members of this channel unless they tell you to
[22:43:31] <prometh> do you want money?
[22:43:32] <Eviltwin> It's in the topic
[22:43:36] <Eviltwin> How much money?
[22:43:42] <iateadonut> $45/hour
[22:43:43] <prometh> how much you want to look at my shit?
[22:43:51] <prometh> it'll probably only take him 15min
[22:44:01] <Eviltwin> How about $20
[22:44:03] <prometh> i'm new to jquery, so i don't know why my shit isbroken
[22:44:04] <prometh> ok
[22:44:05] <prometh> PM?
[22:44:06] <Eviltwin> Assuming it's 15m
[22:44:17] <Eviltwin> Fine
[22:44:24] <Eviltwin> No promises if it's a huge mess though
[22:44:49] <iateadonut> why didn't you post it to pastebin or something?
[22:44:52] <prometh> doubt it's a mess
[22:44:55] <prometh> too long
[22:50:01] <REMITA> HI
[22:50:04] <REMITA> iam calling a php page through ajax
[22:50:17] <REMITA> but the jquery functions on that page not working
[22:51:35] <REMITA> HI
[22:54:48] <siguy> so I've got a career search page, but the client now wants people to search by multiple locations or positions, also they want some positions to have one entry for multiple locations. I'm a bit stumped as to how to make it work for the new specifications. Any pointers? http://eccotique.com/careers/listings/
[22:55:18] <siguy> it works great as long as you select A position and/or A location
[22:56:18] <siguy> the new Position has a list of locations I can't seem to figure out how to access properly
[22:57:56] <siguy> well this is bad timing
[23:00:16] <REMITA> but the jquery functions on that page not working
[23:03:57] <siguy> wow, what the fack is going on ?
[23:06:20] <prometh> net split
[23:23:35] <trusktr> Hey, anyone know how to prevent an element from autoscrolling when you type? For example, the default behavior is that the element scrolls down as you type so the cursor (caret) is always visible... Can this be changed so scrolling doesn't happen and the caret goes out of view while typing?
[23:41:24] <johanhar> looking for a tree-plugin besides dynatree that supports checkboxes :)

[23:53:22] <c0kemachine> I am wanting to merge jQuery 1.4.4 with jQuery-plugins, I wouldn't think so ... but I was wondering if any problems could occur from merging the two files into one? (have the plugins code after jQuery)
[23:56:29] <LukeNukem> Hi people
