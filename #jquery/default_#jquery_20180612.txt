[06:52:18] <WALL-E> Alexander-47u: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[07:10:35] <FilipNortic> I think he wants to know how to make the event trigger if you tab down to the button and press enter?
[07:19:12] <Alexander-47u> yes
[07:19:22] <Alexander-47u> but im having troubles with jsfiddle
[07:24:25] <Woet> Alexander-47u: what is the trouble?

[07:24:54] <Alexander-47u> thanks
[10:53:17] <Guest42921> anyone able to help with UI datepicker?
[10:54:34] <Guest42921> I have a calendar loading in a div, and I need to run a function after it finishes loading, but there isnt an "afterLoad" function available :/
[10:57:29] <Cork> innuoluke: datepicker isn't async so just run it after
[10:57:52] <Cork> if you mean you need to run when it displays; that's another event
[10:58:04] <innuoluke> the calendar reloads itself each time I select a date, meaning I need to run the function again each time
[10:58:20] <Cork> ya, that is the show event
[10:58:36] <innuoluke> using "onselect" doesnt work as it fires that event, then reloads the calendar :/
[10:58:53] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShow
[10:59:02] <Cork> datepicker doesn't have onselect
[10:59:33] <Cork> ah, my mistake
[10:59:50] <Cork> but it runs when the selection is made, not when it is displayed
[11:03:41] <innuoluke> beforeShow say it takes an input element... how does that work if I am using a div, not an input element, to display the calendar?
[11:04:02] <innuoluke> also, beforeShow doesnt seem to be firing at all in my code :/
[11:04:12] <innuoluke> I've put a console.log which doesnt fire at all :/
[11:04:19] <Cork> it gives you the target element
[11:05:19] <Cork> but it looks like something is weird with beforeShow, i can't get it to work with current jquery ui...
[11:05:31] <innuoluke> lol - glad it isnt just me :)
[11:06:22] <Cork> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/inline-datepicker-beforeshow-not-occurring
[11:06:32] <Cork> looks like it isn't fired for inline pickers
[11:07:25] <innuoluke> bugger
[11:08:04] <innuoluke> I assume binding a normal "load" event to the calendar wont work lol
[11:08:05] <innuoluke> ?
[11:08:26] <Cork> haven't read through the plugins code
[11:08:29] <Cork> but i don't think so
[11:08:43] <innuoluke> I'm clutching at straws now lol
[11:09:27] <cariveri> Hi. jquery datepicker doesnt fire. what can cause this? js and css is included successfully and .datepicker(); initialized the inputfield . its class gets changed to "hasDatePicker". still on select nothing happens.
[11:10:51] <innuoluke> @Cork: all I am trying to do is add a bg color to each date depending on values from a DB... I need to do it after the calendar loads as some dates are a single color, but others need a JS generated gradient to show multiple colours :/ I just need a way to fire the function (already working!) each time the calendar reloads
[11:10:59] <Cork> innuoluke: checked though the updateDatepicker function
[11:11:05] <Cork> and it doesn't fire any events at all
[11:13:41] <innuoluke> cant find anything to do with an "updateDatePicker" function :/
[11:21:15] <Cork> innuoluke: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/datepicker.js#L825
[11:21:47] <Cork> cariveri: can you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle?
[11:28:35] <innuoluke> Cork: using the "updateDatepicker" is fine for the first load (e.g. page load) but still cant fire it each time it reloads itself :/
[11:49:54] <innuoluke> Cork: for future reference, adding my function in "onSelect" didnt work (presumably because it runs my function, then updates the calendar), but adding "setTimeout(function() { showCourseColors(); }, 0);" does work, albeit with a slight flicker!
[11:50:14] <innuoluke> note the delay of zero!
[12:12:01] <innuoluke> Cork: found a solution using beforeShowDay to generate <style> elements at the end of the body, then adding classes to each day element! Its not the prettiest, but it works lol
[12:12:11] <innuoluke> Cork: Thanks for your help earlier :)
[12:14:02] <innuoluke> \QUIT My head hurts, but problem solved! Yay me!
[12:14:05] <innuoluke> lol
[12:14:07] <innuoluke> that didnt work
[13:19:24] <Nirvash> Any thoughts on how to isolate a script that's running slowly? It's working, but it takes a looooong time
[13:38:07] <ngharo> Nirvash: This is not related to jQuery but here's an article on profiling on Chrome anyways (https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/devtools-javascript-cpu-profile-migration)
[13:51:23] <balhes> anyone know any examples like this for jquery http://www.calculconversion.com/sales-tax-calculator-hst-gst.html
[14:35:07] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can help me with an input mask regex? I am trying to create a mask that allows for (mm/dd) mm = 1-12 (so valid inputs would be [01] for first cardinality and [12] for last cardinality) - as for the day, it can be 1-28, (so [02] for first cardinality and [0-9] for last cardinality
[14:41:40] <Forbidd3n> well the second cardinality on the mm would have to allow for [0-9] but only 3-9 if the first item is 0
[15:19:21] <cthulchu> initialize methods are, basically, constructors?
[15:19:57] <cthulchu> and we can have many initialize methods with different signatures?
[15:20:02] <cthulchu> oops, sorry
[15:20:05] <cthulchu> wrong channel
[15:34:56] <jak2000> hi all
[15:36:35] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:36:45] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/tr49ymp3/   <--- how to, click on button and disable button Editar/Cancelar    thanks.....
[15:36:54] <jak2000> robertmaxrees good afternoon and night
[15:37:10] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[15:38:12] <jak2000> i have tried to hidde the buttons on a specific row.. and worked....
[15:38:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> so you want to disable them instead, right?
[15:39:05] <jak2000> wait
[15:39:11] <jak2000> yes disable
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you need to bind an event listener and then disable the buttons.
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> so start with that first one.
[15:39:49] <robertmaxrees> how do you bind the listener?
[15:41:02] <jak2000> i think in this: add a class to entire row (tr class='myclass') and then disable it?
[15:41:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:41:11] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[15:41:17] <robertmaxrees> bind the event listener to the button first./
[15:41:18] <jak2000> bind listener?
[15:41:53] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[15:41:54] <jak2000> something like:  $(document).on("click", "#btnDisable", function () {
[15:41:59] <jak2000> ?
[15:42:03] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, sure/.
[15:42:06] <robertmaxrees> so add the binding.
[15:44:23] <robertmaxrees> and then select the buttons you want to disable and use .prop() to set the disabled property on the element
[15:44:51] <jak2000> $(".clScreenMode").children().prop('disabled',false);
[15:44:53] <jak2000> something
[15:45:25] <jak2000> add bindong to? button.tableedit?-edit-button ?
[15:45:28] <robertmaxrees> why not add a semantic class to the buttons and select that instead?
[15:45:28] <jak2000> *binding?
[15:45:42] <jak2000> tableedit is a external plugin
[15:45:43] <robertmaxrees> don't you want to bind to btnDisable?
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:46:07] <robertmaxrees> you can still add classes using the plugin.
[15:46:12] <robertmaxrees> class: 'btn btn-sm btn-success',
[15:46:39] <robertmaxrees> or you could do $('#example1').find('button')
[15:47:16] <jak2000> something: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/po7dq146/ line 13 ?
[15:47:36] <jak2000> oooo then:
[15:47:36] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, or you can use the line I just showed.
[15:47:37] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[15:47:56] <jak2000> $(".xButtons").children().prop('disabled',false);
[15:48:02] <jak2000> beautiful
[15:48:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:48:10] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[15:48:15] <robertmaxrees> not .children
[15:48:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to disable the buttons themselves.
[15:48:25] <jak2000> i add because
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> so just $('.xButtons').prop('disabled', true);
[15:48:44] <jak2000> the class xButtons can be on a Div... and disable all elements..
[15:48:51] <robertmaxrees> then .filter()
[15:48:53] <jak2000> ok then user other class for divs...
[15:48:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> even better
[15:49:12] <jak2000> filter better than children right?
[15:49:22] <robertmaxrees> filter and children do two different things.
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> filter was one wayu to deparate the divs from buttons with that class.
[15:49:46] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to use .children() though.
[15:49:48] <jak2000> testing
[15:50:00] <robertmaxrees> since you want to disable the button, not children of the button./
[15:50:45] <jak2000> final fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/02wug5sy/
[15:50:51] <jak2000> other question

[15:51:59] <jak2000> i know how: $("#xfechaIni").datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd'});
[15:52:00] <robertmaxrees> just hidden.
[15:52:07] <jak2000> but the name of the input? wich is?
[15:52:23] <jak2000> in this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/02wug5sy/

[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> looks like it.
[15:53:41] <jak2000> but the id?
[15:53:43] <jak2000> :(
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't need an ID.

[15:55:53] <robertmaxrees> $('.tabledit-input').filter(function() { return this.name === 'fecha' });
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[15:56:13] <jak2000> mmmm

[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> then you .datepicker off it
[15:56:48] <jak2000> $('.tabledit-input').filter(function() { return this.name === 'fecha' }).datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd'});

[16:46:10] <robertmaxrees> why??
[16:46:49] <sine0> because im testing something
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:47:18] <sine0> so do you know how
[16:47:33] <sine0> or you just curious up in here
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what "I ahve tried }, 2000)"
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> mind pasting the code in a fiddle or something?
[16:48:11] <sine0> just tell me how i delay the execution of the code in jquery
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> it depends on what you're doing.
[16:48:30] <sine0> you guys have had more fiddles than an irish pub band
[16:48:43] <robertmaxrees> "execution of the code in jquery" is ambiguous.
[16:48:51] <sine0> pause
[16:48:56] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout might be what you want?
[16:48:57] <sine0> wait
[16:49:05] <sine0> every language has it
[16:49:08] <sine0> ok ill check it thanks
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language
[16:49:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s6Lyf1bu/ is one way
[16:50:42] <sine0> ok cool, how do I use that in conjunction with .ready when the page loads
[16:50:56] <sine0> put another function inside it and call it with settimeout
[16:50:57] <robertmaxrees> wrap the document ready about that.
[16:51:01] <sine0> ya

[17:04:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[17:06:37] <jak2000> not work the timedout
[17:06:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:06:46] <robertmaxrees> yes it does
[17:06:54] <robertmaxrees> you have it set for 20 seconds.
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> also alert is a bad idea.
[17:07:06] <robertmaxrees> since it halts the page while it's open.
[17:07:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s6Lyf1bu/4/
[17:07:11] <jak2000> add 00 more and immediatly display the alert

[17:07:42] <jak2000> i see
[17:07:53] <jak2000> why display first after ?
[17:07:54] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting the alerts to do something different?
[17:07:57] <jak2000> yes
[17:08:08] <jak2000> i want or expect:
[17:08:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you seeing happen?
[17:08:18] <jak2000> consolelog before then foo then after
[17:08:26] <jak2000> before after and foo :(
[17:08:26] <robertmaxrees> oh, no.
[17:08:32] <jak2000> i watn before foo after
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout says "run this code after x seconds" and keeps going.
[17:09:01] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise the page would have to lock up while it waited.
[17:09:35] <jak2000> ooo

[18:45:49] <robertmaxrees> you dosn't need either though.
[18:45:56] <robertmaxrees> you want to set disabled ON the buttons.
[18:46:01] <robertmaxrees> not children of the buttons
[18:46:06] <jak2000> yes but tood divs
[18:46:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:46:12] <jak2000> yes i remember not use children use filter
[18:46:29] <robertmaxrees> so there are other ways to do this without filter./
[18:46:37] <robertmaxrees> 1 would be to use a different class that isn't shared.
[18:47:17] <jak2000> yes i think
[18:47:25] <robertmaxrees> which is preferred./
[18:47:27] <jak2000> but can you explain me the filter? please
[18:47:43] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:47:50] <robertmaxrees> " Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. "
[18:49:14] <robertmaxrees> \
[18:49:15] <jak2000> always oficial documentation....
[18:49:24] <robertmaxrees> well yeah heh
[18:49:30] <robertmaxrees> it answers your question :)
[18:50:33] <jak2000> :(
[18:50:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:50:43] <robertmaxrees> are you still confused?
[18:51:07] <jak2000> a little
[18:51:13] <jak2000> see: $('.xButtons').filter(prop('disabled', true));   this is bad
[18:51:23] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:51:24] <robertmaxrees> well right.
[18:51:42] <jak2000> checking official documentation...
[18:52:19] <robertmaxrees> filter expects a selector, a function, or a selection.
[18:52:27] <jak2000> .filter('.xButtons').prop('disabled', true);
[18:52:29] <jak2000> win?
[18:52:35] <robertmaxrees> err
[18:52:48] <jak2000> error
[18:52:49] <jak2000> :(
[18:52:51] <robertmaxrees> but $('.xButtons').filter('.xButtons') ???
[18:52:52] <jak2000> on my fiddle
[18:52:59] <jak2000> why twice?
[18:53:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:53:10] <robertmaxrees> you have to start with $() somewhere.,
[18:53:14] <robertmaxrees> you need the jquery object.
[18:53:38] <jak2000> if remember... i can do a:   .trim(anyString);  ?
[18:53:40] <robertmaxrees> so $('.xButtons') <- you want to reduce this down.
[18:53:53] <robertmaxrees> do <buttons>, right?
[18:53:56] <robertmaxrees> &ti
[18:54:02] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahaha **to
[18:54:18] <jak2000> wotked
[18:54:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:54:40] <jak2000> *wroked
[18:54:46] <robertmaxrees> what'd you do?
[18:55:22] <jak2000> this:
[18:55:33] <jak2000>  $('.xButtons').filter('.xButtons').prop('disabled', true);
[18:55:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:55:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to do what you want though.
[18:56:01] <robertmaxrees> that's the same as doing $('.xButtons').prop('disabled', true);
[18:56:12] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[18:56:25] <jak2000> yes but if the class: xButtons  is on a div, this work right?
[18:56:33] <robertmaxrees> that'll also select the divs still.
[18:56:38] <robertmaxrees> you're not filtering to just buttons
[18:57:07] <robertmaxrees> slow down a sec - think about it this way: $('.xButtons').filter('some other selector').prop('disabled', true);
[18:57:33] <robertmaxrees> so what's the "other selector" you could use to differentiate just the buttons?
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> hint: think about how you'd select buttons
[18:59:49] <jak2000> yes i know how
[18:59:50] <jak2000> but wait
[18:59:56] <jak2000> i put on my fiddle some divs
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> dude lol
[19:00:09] <robertmaxrees> so filter('some selector')
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> what do you think you'd put there?
[19:00:41] <robertmaxrees> you have $('.xButtons').filter('selector for buttons here');
[19:01:46] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/hz0gk734/
[19:01:52] <jak2000> answering your question
[19:02:06] <robertmaxrees> how do you select button elements.
[19:02:10] <robertmaxrees> not via class.
[19:02:43] <robertmaxrees> $('.xButtons').filter('button')
[19:02:44] <jak2000> mm in the table, with tr ?
[19:02:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[19:02:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:02:48] <robertmaxrees> dude
[19:02:50] <jak2000> ooo
[19:02:56] <robertmaxrees> *Sigh*
[19:03:01] <robertmaxrees> gotta slow down a bit.
[19:03:47] <robertmaxrees> you really should check out http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/
[19:03:54] <jak2000> :)
[19:04:12] <jak2000> robertmaxrees
[19:04:29] <jak2000> $('.xButtons').filter('button'); <-- this slect all butons under class xButtons right?
[19:04:50] <robertmaxrees> not "under"
[19:05:19] <robertmaxrees> it's basically saying "for all .xButtons, bet me the ones that also match the selector 'button'"
[19:05:27] <robertmaxrees> *bet=get
[19:05:28] <jak2000> ok understand
[19:05:43] <jak2000> and what happend if was buttons and divs?
[19:05:46] <robertmaxrees> just like the docs explain ;)
[19:05:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:05:57] <jak2000>  $('.xButtons').filter('button div') ?
[19:06:07] <robertmaxrees> well think about it.
[19:06:13] <robertmaxrees> what would happen if you did $('button div')_
[19:06:17] <robertmaxrees> what would that get you?
[19:06:52] <jak2000> nothing
[19:06:58] <jak2000> need 2 lines
[19:07:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:07:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:07:15] <jak2000> $('.xButtons').filter('button');  and $('.xButtons').filter('div');   right?
[19:07:19] <robertmaxrees> it would try to get you all divs that are descendents of buttons
[19:07:25] <robertmaxrees> no
[19:07:35] <robertmaxrees> 'button div' selects all divs under buttons.
[19:07:47] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking 'button, div'
[19:08:09] <jak2000> yes
[19:08:10] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/L3er78bh/3/
[19:08:14] <jak2000> see not hidden....
[19:08:28] <robertmaxrees> right...
[19:08:48] <robertmaxrees> because you're saying "get me all .xButtons that also match either 'button' or 'div'"
[19:09:55] <robertmaxrees> $('.xButtons').filter('button') is the same as $('button.xButtons')
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[19:16:25] <jak2000> yes
[19:16:26] <jak2000> testing
[19:22:40] <jak2000> tomorrow return much thanks
[19:22:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
