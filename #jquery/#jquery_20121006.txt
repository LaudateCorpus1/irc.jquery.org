[00:54:01] <manners13> http://codepad.org/KBKEmXFE
[01:17:41] <CarlSeagan> guys, question about jquerymobile
[01:17:46] <CarlSeagan> I'm trying to link a php file
[01:17:49] <CarlSeagan> but it gives me errors
[01:18:03] <CarlSeagan> <a href="index.php" data-transition="flip">Not working</a>
[01:18:56] <CarlSeagan> the file is in test/test.php and when I hit the link instead of taking me to index it takes me to localhost/test.php#/test/index.php
[01:23:52] <bluesm> hi
[01:24:05] <bluesm> .eq(-1) is equal .last() yeap ?
[01:24:26] <xkr47> easy to try with firebug I guess ?
[01:24:37] <xkr47> var foo = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
[01:24:44] <xkr47> oops :D
[01:24:53] <xkr47> I mean
[01:25:38] <xkr47> $("<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>").find("li").eq(-1);
[01:27:52] <bluesm> so ?
[01:28:00] <xkr47> or better yet $("<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>").find("li").eq(-1).text();
[01:28:03] <xkr47> --> "3"
[01:28:44] <bluesm> It is ..
[01:32:39] <yoohahn> bluesm: yepp it is. - in eq counts backwards
[01:32:52] <bluesm> yoohahn: Thanks :)
[01:33:36] <bluesm> yoohahn: Why they do last() and first() if I can do it all with eq(x) ?
[01:37:15] <ravenzz> first is a alias of eq(0)
[01:37:35] <ravenzz> last still uses eq()
[01:37:47] <ravenzz> with some extra logic to get the last element
[01:37:58] <yoohahn> bluesm: Not sure, probarbly easier to understand. .first returns theElem.eq( -1 )
[01:38:29] <bluesm>  .first returns theElem.eq( 0 )  ... I suspect...
[01:38:41] <yoohahn> yeah
[01:38:57] <DukeDrake> last maybe simply theElem.eq(theElem.length - 1) ?
[01:39:21] <ravenzz> last eq(-1)
[01:39:54] <ravenzz> basically because eq uses slice
[01:40:50] <bluesm> slice ?
[01:40:53] <bluesm> What do you mean ?
[01:41:08] <bluesm> slice in arrays ? Yeap ?
[01:41:25] <ravenzz> yes
[01:41:26] <yoohahn> yeah
[01:44:18] <bluesm> Thank you very much!
[02:07:03] <manners13> hey guys
[02:07:41] <manners13> using this code i can get a list of selected node keys in a popup box which i will eventually change to a different page
[02:07:42] <manners13> http://codepad.org/y1XFJ9m1
[02:08:03] <manners13> can someone point me in the right direction for it to display the names instead of the keys
[02:09:25] <manners13> http://codepad.org/m0V2zxkM this is teh full code i use not including the php
[02:10:22] <manners13> echoSelection3 prints a list of the names on the page but i really need to pass this list to a php script
[02:18:07] <nisseni> I'm trying to use .ready() on a element, that's possible, right?
[02:19:09] <nisseni> can't get it working properly
[02:45:09] <no_gravity> I really dislike the javascript Date object. Does jquery include any date functions?
[03:17:52] <nisseni> really not much activity in here today :)
[04:09:33] <GoSox> can you animate the changing of background properties? Either solid color to different solid color, or image to solid color and back? Nothing fancy, just a simple fade?
[04:13:11] <joeytwiddle> pretty sure you can do with former, with .animate() i think
[04:19:29] <angelazou> hello, I need a little help with this snippet
[04:19:30] <angelazou> there is a bug here
[04:19:58] <angelazou> the phrases, such as q1 is supposed to match to one, and c3 to three, and so on
[04:20:18] <angelazou> but it seems like, randomly, they are not being dropped to the right location
[04:22:19] <angelazou_> sorry, connection timed out
[04:57:01] <lelu> hello
[04:58:12] <lelu> I have a carousel plugin that I am using with a responsive width layout I am working on. If the browser is resized I want the carousel to be reloaded with different settings. How do I go about this?
[04:58:31] <lelu> In other words I wish to unhook a plugin from a html element and then reinit it with different config
[04:59:13] <lelu> or just update the plugins options during runtime
[06:04:11] <questiondude> Hi guys. I have a problem with the "load" function of jquery. I am trying to load dynamic content into a div. The problem is that the content is not displayed properly clicking the link the first time. The second time it is working fine. I read something that even that the "load" callback is called styles might not have been loaded already or something like that. Do you know a solution for this problem?
[06:09:09] <Jetbeard> questiondude, http://api.jquery.com/load/ http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:09:26] <Jetbeard> the load event is nothing to do with the load function
[06:09:46] <Jetbeard> (even if they do have the same name and are, technically, the same function (which just dispatches based on the type of the argument)
[06:10:04] <Jetbeard> it sounds like the thing you read refers to the load event
[06:10:09] <Jetbeard> whereas you're trying to use the load function
[06:11:35] <Jetbeard> questiondude, it's possible you might be calling the load function before the contents of the div has loaded the first time. that may upset things
[06:11:50] <Jetbeard> make sure you're calling the load function after the page has loaded
[06:12:26] <questiondude> Thanks. Let me explain you in detail what I am trying to solve. I am loading a fullCalendar into a div. The first time its not displayed properly, the second time it is. I am working around that at the moment with following line in the load callback function: setTimeout("jQuery('#divCalendar').fullCalendar( 'render' );", 50);
[06:14:23] <questiondude> YOu know what I mean?
[06:23:06] <Jetbeard> questiondude, you're loading it in when the page is loaded?
[06:26:09] <questiondude> I am loading it after a click on a link/accordion: $("#indexContentRight").load(url, function() {
[06:26:29] <questiondude> The fullcalendar html site will be loaded into indexContentRight
[06:26:46] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone here use the ECB's currency feed?
[06:26:51] <questiondude> so now when the callback of load is executed i am executing my workaround
[06:31:58] <angelazou_> hi, I need a little help with the draggable and droppable of jquery ui
[06:32:05] <angelazou_> see http://jsbin.com/emumok/1/
[06:32:19] <angelazou_> it seems like the scope of the draggable is wrong
[06:32:41] <aaa> hi
[06:32:49] <angelazou_> and it's not reverting when it's supposed to snap with a particular section
[06:33:05] <sjeijk> is this correct $('ul.dropdown li.first').delay(5000).addClass('showMenu');
[06:33:13] <sjeijk> cuz its not delaying somehow
[06:38:10] <ule> Good morning guys
[06:38:54] <ule> I'm trying to get the value of a select field, but it was in a page that was loaded dynamically using $.get method
[06:39:02] <ule> How can I get this value? Can I?
[06:40:28] <ule> I tryed:  var divLoaded = $("#divLoaded option:selected").val();
[06:44:31] <ukukuk> @ule when do you try to get this value? Is it in a function? If this is a functino you have to initialize the function again after the dynamically load ;)
[06:46:35] <ule> ukukuk: 	I put html into a #divLoaded using this: $.get("external_values.php", function(data) { $("#divLoaded").html(data); }
[06:47:08] <ukukuk> yes okay.. and when do you want to get the value? is it an onclick event or something else?
[06:47:12] <ule> inside external_values.php I have a html form
[06:47:12] <ule> and now.. I'd like to get values of this form
[06:47:22] <ule> I've tryed this: var divLoaded = $("#divLoaded option:selected").val();
[06:47:36] <ukukuk> yes and when do you try this? if the form is submitted?
[06:48:11] <ule> but Im receiving "undefined"
[06:48:11] <ule> ukukuk: I have a button field in parent page
[06:48:26] <ule> no.. its a simple button..
[06:48:37] <ukukuk> ule you have a click event on the button right?
[06:48:52] <ukukuk> okay.. strange.
[06:49:06] <ukukuk> did you try to debug with console.log?
[06:49:11] <ule> $("#myButtom").click(function () {     window.alert(   $("#divLoaded option:selected").val()  ); }
[06:49:17] <ukukuk> ok
[06:49:27] <ukukuk> wait while I try
[06:49:57] <ule> ow sorry.. the correctly is:
[06:50:47] <ule> $("#myButtom").click(function () {     window.alert(   $("#myFormFieldLoadedDynammicly option:selected").val()  ); }
[06:51:15] <ule> I think I have to put something like:   $[#myDivLoadedUsingGET . #myFormFieldLoadedDynamically]
[06:51:57] <ule> but I don't know how to do it
[06:53:41] <ukukuk> ule no.. it also don't work without any get request.
[06:54:07] <ule> I can't get the value from a FORM that I loaded dynamiclly?
[06:54:14] <ule> that sucks
[06:54:19] <ule> :(
[06:54:25] <angelazou_> ule: try .ajax
[06:54:28] <angelazou_> there is a success method
[06:54:35] <ule> angelazou_: what?
[06:54:36] <angelazou_> so you can get your values from there
[06:55:58] <angelazou_> ule: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:56:12] <ule> angelazou_: ow.. thanks.. I going to read it
[06:56:21] <angelazou_> ukukuk: can you help me out on a draggable and droppable issue?
[06:56:39] <angelazou_> I have it here http://jsbin.com/emumok/1/edit
[06:56:47] <ukukuk> angelazou_ I hope so.
[06:56:51] <ukukuk> yes a moment
[06:56:57] <ukukuk> I have to help ule first
[06:57:07] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, anyone of you have facebook?
[06:57:28] <jarr0dsz> anyone noticed the chat instant messenger at the bottom?.. it stays there on every page reload, so if you navigate the facebook site the chat is not reloaded
[06:57:37] <jarr0dsz> i wondered how they would do this, if this is a jquery trick somehow
[06:57:50] <jarr0dsz> and if anyone has an idea on how to replicate this behaviour
[06:58:16] <ukukuk> ule : try something like that: http://pastebin.com/zZfPaRR5 this works for me
[06:58:48] <ukukuk> angelazou_ ok now i open your link
[06:58:54] <ukukuk> angelazou_ what's the issue?
[06:59:18] <Dwarf> Anyone up for some brainstorming about hand making an image slider?
[06:59:22] <angelazou_> ukukuk: the draggable item seem to have the wrong scope
[06:59:27] <angelazou_> I can't drag it to where I want it to be
[06:59:38] <Dwarf> Or rather image rotator
[06:59:40] <angelazou_> which is the big grey box on the left
[06:59:48] <ukukuk> angelazou_ ok, i take a look
[07:00:02] <ukukuk> Dwarf brainstorming? haha just programming :P
[07:00:09] <Dwarf> mmmm
[07:00:19] <Dwarf> I need to get a general idea of how to do it before I can actually program it ;)
[07:02:02] <ule> ukukuk: it worked! thanks so much dude
[07:02:08] <ukukuk> ule no prob
[07:02:18] <ule> angelazou_: thanks also for your help
[07:02:25] <ule> ukukuk: :D
[07:02:31] <angelazou_> ule: you're welcome
[07:02:44] <ukukuk> Dwarf haha okay.. yes you can do it like: preload on the right and with jquery method "animate" to proceed to the left side ;)
[07:02:47] <ukukuk> Dwarf haha okay.. yes you can do it like: preload on the right and with jquery method "animate" to proceed to the left side ;)
[07:03:08] <Dwarf> MMmm
[07:03:14] <Dwarf> I was thinking of doing it with z-indexes
[07:04:09] <ukukuk> okay you want it like a fading slider?
[07:04:24] <ukukuk> Dwarf just use the jquery cycle plugin..
[07:04:32] <Dwarf> No
[07:04:33] <ukukuk> angelazou_ it is a hard code ^^
[07:04:45] <Dwarf> This is a school assignment
[07:04:52] <ukukuk> Dwarf ok
[07:04:56] <angelazou_> ukukuk: well, I'm just having a problem with the draggable section
[07:05:11] <angelazou_> The rest of the code is pretty neat, I think, and I comment a lot
[07:05:30] <angelazou_> Dwarf: you can first take a look at how other sliding plugins are made
[07:05:40] <angelazou_> and then figure out how to do one yourself :)
[07:05:56] <angelazou_> although I think you'll probably end up rewriting the same code again
[07:07:01] <Dwarf> mhm
[07:07:24] <ukukuk> angelazou_ yes the code is good. I also used draggable a lot but this issue I've never seen.. but I saw an issue in your html/css code.. perhaps it is a floating problem… -> add float:left for #boxcard
[07:08:25] <ule> Why it doesn't works?  $('#ID_of_my_select_field').children('option').each(function() {
[07:08:27] <angelazou_> ukukuk: aha...super :) I am elated!!!
[07:08:29] <ukukuk> Dwarf you can load all images positioning absolute in a div and every image is behind the other image. so you can fade one image away with jquery fadeout. and go ahead with the nex image
[07:08:41] <Dwarf> Yap
[07:08:44] <Dwarf> That's what I intend to do
[07:08:49] <Dwarf> Somehow
[07:08:50] <Dwarf> hehe
[07:08:51] <angelazou_> ule: each function works only in this format $.each
[07:08:55] <ukukuk> angelazou_ just try ;) I don't know whether it works
[07:08:58] <angelazou_> so you need 2 lines
[07:09:12] <angelazou_> var variable = $('#ID_of_my_select_field').children('option');
[07:09:29] <Dunstkreis> Hey folks. I am using the tiptip Addon, and dont know how to get rid of the tip tip, without deleting the element, it is attached to...
[07:09:37] <ule> angelazou_: alright.. I'll try
[07:09:40] <angelazou_> $.each(variable, function() { //Do stuff here });
[07:09:48] <angelazou_> ule: read the documentation
[07:10:05] <ule> angelazou_: thanks so much
[07:10:13] <ukukuk> angelazou_ but the method "each" also works in the format $('HTML element').each(function() { });
[07:10:25] <ukukuk> ;)
[07:10:28] <angelazou_> ukukuk: really?
[07:10:32] <ukukuk> yes
[07:10:36] <angelazou_> wow, guess I should read the doc too
[07:10:50] <angelazou_> then I guess the reason it didn't work is because .children() are unchainable
[07:10:51] <ukukuk> it does not work with arrays I guess
[07:11:34] <angelazou_> i think, you can also do this $.each($('#ID_of_my_select_field').children('option'), function() { //Do stuff here });
[07:11:35] <angelazou_> maybe
[07:11:53] <ukukuk> yeah should work too
[07:11:54] <angelazou_> I usually cache it though
[07:12:10] <angelazou_> much better to cache it
[07:12:39] <angelazou_> funny, the most I use jquery, the less I use variables
[07:12:45] <ukukuk> perhaps it is an other JS problem. ule you should open the console of your browser (in Google Chrome it is Shift + Control + I) and look for javascript issues. perhaps you have to use jQuery instead of $
[07:14:29] <ukukuk> ule another idea. if you use children() the option elements have to be directly within the select without optgroups ;)
[07:14:47] <ule> ukukuk: I found the problem
[07:14:52] <ule> ukukuk: you right
[07:14:55] <ukukuk> ule ok
[07:15:06] <angelazou_> ukukuk: a followup issue, the revert is not really working
[07:15:06] <ule> ukukuk: Can you belive.. I forgot the id=
[07:15:18] <ukukuk> ule hahahahaha
[07:15:22] <ule> ukukuk: omg!!!  <select name="alunosJaCadastrados" size="15">
[07:15:29] <ukukuk> ule haha
[07:15:42] <ule> ukukuk: I don't belive I do it!!!
[07:15:49] <ukukuk> angelazou_ the other thing worked?
[07:16:23] <ukukuk> ule haha is no problem. anyone can do messy things
[07:16:48] <ule> ukukuk: thanks.. :)
[07:17:17] <angelazou_> ukukuk: yes, the float: left worked
[07:17:25] <angelazou_> but revert works in a weird way now
[07:17:29] <ukukuk> angelazou_ I can't believe :P haha
[07:17:43] <ukukuk> angelazou_ do you have a new version to share with me? new link?
[07:18:18] <angelazou_> ukukuk: yep: http://jsbin.com/emumok/2/edit
[07:18:18] <ukukuk> angelazou_ ok I refreshed the page.. revert works for me fine
[07:18:27] <Dwarf> Alright, I give my images a z-index by doing the following:
[07:18:27] <Dwarf> $('.slider img').each(function(index){
[07:18:27] <Dwarf> 					$(this).css('z-index', index);
[07:18:27] <Dwarf> 				});
[07:18:32] <Dwarf> How do I reverse the order?
[07:18:49] <angelazou_> well, revert only works when the draggable is over the image
[07:19:17] <ukukuk> angelazou_ ah well this revert
[07:19:20] <angelazou_> but when the draggable fell into the wrong box, it doesn't show that it's finished
[07:19:39] <angelazou_> the draggable got stick onto the droppable and that's it
[07:19:39] <Dwarf> disregard that
[07:19:45] <angelazou_> this must be a bug
[07:20:20] <ukukuk> Dwarf which order?
[07:20:33] <angelazou_> and snap doesn't seem to work either
[07:20:38] <Dwarf> It's alright, I seem to have fixed it with another approach
[07:21:16] <ukukuk> angelazou_ well. if it's correct it should not stick and finish .. and if it is not correct you should move it again
[07:21:20] <ukukuk> right?
[07:21:45] <angelazou_> yes
[07:21:53] <angelazou_> and even better, if it's not correct, it should revert
[07:22:05] <angelazou_> but not sure how that should've happened
[07:22:06] <ukukuk> angelazou_ ok i got it.. i take a look
[07:22:17] <angelazou_> thanks
[07:22:20] <bluesm> Hi.
[07:22:28] <angelazou_> bluesm: hi
[07:22:42] <ukukuk> angelazou_ perhaps: ui.draggable.draggable( 'option', 'revert', false );
[07:22:47] <ukukuk> angelazou_ set it to true
[07:22:47] <bluesm> Is jquery fast compared to the other libraries ?
[07:24:07] <angelazou_> ukukuk: thank you...although I'm not so sure why the logic works
[07:24:36] <angelazou_> I mean shouldn't it be set to no longer draggable ONLY after it found the right match?
[07:24:37] <ukukuk> :P haha.. have you customized? can i refresh to take a look at the result?
[07:26:52] <angelazou_> yes, you can just reload the page I think
[07:27:13] <angelazou_> oh it's actually http://jsbin.com/emumok/3/edit now, sorry
[07:27:40] <ukukuk> haha now it reverts the correct ones ^^
[07:28:00] <ukukuk> your if -statement is not correct I guess ;)
[07:28:06] <ukukuk> sorry i have to leave
[07:28:14] <ukukuk> good luck.. bye
[07:44:51] <MGA555> In datatables, it seems that "bAutoWidth" cannot be set to false for just one column in a table.  Is there a workaround that would allow me to specify the width of one column and have the others autosized?  thanks
[08:14:01] <angelazou> having a little problem with this shuffling snippet http://jsbin.com/ihitud/1/edit
[08:14:10] <angelazou> it doesn't even run the first line
[08:14:24] <angelazou> it just stopped and say maximum execution timed out
[08:14:34] <angelazou> what does that suppose to mean?
[08:44:47] <cusco> hi
[08:45:00] <cusco> im using sortable with 'connectWith'
[08:45:19] <cusco> IE and Chrome seem to be ok with ui.item.context.innerText
[08:45:24] <cusco> but firefox is undefined
[08:53:58] <expando-> http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/#asynchronous_callbacks
[08:54:26] <expando-> Keeping Tests Atomic
[08:54:41] <expando-> the second example should pass successfully
[08:54:44] <expando-> but it fails
[08:54:51] <expando-> why? how to run it?
[08:57:55] <angelazou> I have collected the children elements of a particular element and store it as a variable
[08:58:12] <angelazou> but how do I retrieve the content of a specific child
[08:58:20] <angelazou> like the third child
[08:58:35] <angelazou> I know I can retrieve it using the :nth-child selector on the parent element
[08:58:48] <angelazou> but in this case, I can't use it, and I only have children
[08:58:57] <angelazou> so how do I do it?
[09:00:14] <angelazou> I've already tried children.1
[09:00:19] <angelazou> but that's not working
[09:00:54] <expando-> $("div.entry:nth-child(3)")
[09:01:11] <expando-> your source must be inside document.ready
[09:01:26] <expando-> or just before body
[09:01:54] <expando-> replace div.entry
[09:02:03] <expando-> with your selector
[09:02:19] <expando-> if it doesn't works yet
[09:02:55] <expando-> check for some examples in google and in the issue tracking system
[09:03:55] <expando-> what about my example?
[09:04:09] <expando-> why it doesn't running?
[09:06:02] <angelazou> well, like I said, I can't use the :nth-child for some reason
[09:06:16] <angelazou> so I have only children to work with
[09:06:16] <angelazou> which are stored in a variable
[09:06:25] <expando-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2026885/jquery-nth-child-selector
[09:06:32] <expando-> check this one
[09:06:41] <expando-> and what is the content of your variable?
[09:07:09] <angelazou> again, I'm not trying to use the nth-child selector
[09:07:24] <expando-> can you show your example?
[09:08:21] <angelazou> one moment please
[09:09:06] <kryl> hi, do you know a framework in jquery for doing statistics ?
[09:09:16] <angelazou> expando- here you go http://jsbin.com/ihitud/3/edit
[09:09:37] <angelazou> the reason why I'm doing this is because I need to shuffle some sibling elements themselves
[09:09:57] <angelazou> so my option are just to re-arrange the sequence at which they are shown
[09:10:57] <angelazou> my plan is to 1- get a random index number, 2- find the element on that index, 3- insert the current element before that index
[09:11:09] <angelazou> this way, the elements can get nicely shuffled
[09:12:21] <angelazou> kryl: www.jstat.org/
[09:12:31] <angelazou> or just google for jquery statistics
[09:14:41] <expando-> are your indices correct?
[09:15:08] <expando-> and children.html() will give you the html
[09:15:22] <expando-> children.attr - the atribute desired
[09:15:33] <expando-> children.css - the css
[09:15:45] <expando-> and children.text() - the text
[09:15:57] <expando-> jquery silently fails, so be careful
[09:15:57] <kryl> angelazou, thx u
[09:16:29] <expando-> you are wondering
[09:16:36] <expando-> how to change the dom structure?
[09:16:52] <glen> anyone has ideas why .filter takes up cpu, like described here: https://github.com/glensc/dokuwiki-plugin-lightboxv2/issues/2#issuecomment-7598436
[10:01:03] <MGA555> 	In datatables, it seems that "bAutoWidth" cannot be set to false for just one column in a table. Is there a workaround that would allow me to specify the width of one column and have the others autosized? thanks
[10:35:27] <Heather_> Trying to remove/add class attribute: http://jsfiddle.net/cyberpuunk/D2RLR/2372/
[10:36:22] <Heather_> cant manipulate the class attribute
[10:52:48] <expando-> http://jsbin.com/ufoyic/1/edit
[10:52:56] <expando-> it is my source code
[10:53:18] <expando-> it must run successfully and all the tests should pass according to:
[10:53:38] <expando-> http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/
[10:54:21] <expando-> Keeping Tests Atomic
[10:54:24] <expando-> section
[10:54:39] <expando-> what is the reason the source code to not run?
[10:54:53] <expando-> successfully
[10:55:14] <expando-> in google chrome, firefox and opera, i didn't  check ie
[10:58:38] <expando-> is it a bug in qunit or is it a my failure?
[10:59:57] <expando-> i got it ...
[11:00:13] <expando-> the div with id="qunit-fixture"
[11:00:31] <expando-> should be outside the div with id="qunit"
[11:00:54] <expando-> and the id used in the test must be "quinit-fixture"
[11:00:57] <expando-> then it passes
[11:03:32] <expando-> but .. what is interesting
[11:04:00] <expando-> here is - in this way - the test that should fail in the example - passes :)
[11:05:28] <expando-> http://jsbin.com/ufoyic/1/edit

[11:10:14] <cusco> hi....
[11:11:24] <cusco> chrome and IE can validate event.srcElement but on Firefox it is undefined
[11:14:20] <expando-> var target = event.target || event.srcElement;
[11:14:32] <expando-> cusco
[11:14:39] <expando-> you can use this :)
[11:15:06] <cusco> target is present in both, but is it the element?
[11:15:31] <expando-> it seems - yes
[11:15:45] <cusco> no
[11:15:55] <cusco> Im using sortable connectwith
[11:16:11] <expando-> ?
[11:16:12] <cusco> um moving a <li> from a ul to another ul
[11:16:28] <cusco> and target becomes the whole <ul> wwhere the <li> is being dropped
[11:16:43] <cusco> I would like to change the <li> (use .append())
[11:16:53] <cusco> and I was using event.srcElement for that
[11:16:58] <cusco> in chrome and IE works
[11:18:05] <expando-> function yourHandler(event) { event = event || window.event; var target = event.target || event.srcElement; ...}
[11:18:13] <expando-> try this one
[11:18:49] <expando-> is it better now?
[11:20:17] <cusco> expando-: .target is the <ul>
[11:20:22] <cusco> I want the <li> being moved
[11:21:15] <expando-> the event is different
[11:21:20] <expando-> for the different browsers
[11:21:24] <cusco> :(
[11:21:36] <expando-> event = event || window.event ?
[11:21:43] <expando-> did you try this?
[11:21:54] <cusco> no...
[11:22:08] <expando-> function yourHandler(event) { event = event || window.event; var target = event.target || event.srcElement; ...}
[11:22:19] <expando-> it was the reason to post the whole function
[11:22:33] <expando-> try and say is it ok?
[11:22:40] <expando-> but try it carefully
[11:22:42] <cusco> I will try
[11:23:39] <expando-> i think there may be some jquery code that can be useful for you
[11:23:48] <expando-> it is the hard way, using only javascript
[11:23:53] <unknown815> Hi guys. When I am loading dynamic content into the div using jquery "$("#container").load(url) it loads the website. As mentioned by the jquery-load-documentation, scripts will be executed in this case. Now, I have some java scripts referenced in the loaded html. The problem is, that the script is not executed ($(document).ready is not called). Do you know how I can make the script execute without calling anything from outside manually?
[11:24:11] <cusco> im looking into ui
[11:24:15] <cusco> may have what I need
[11:24:38] <expando-> :) cheers
[11:25:31] <cusco> unknown815: call those scripts in the .load() callback
[11:26:12] <cusco> ui.item.context has what I need in chrome... lets see in ff
[11:26:32] <cusco> yep! also
[11:26:36] <unknown815> But thats the manually way and I need to know every script/what I have to call. Is there no way of making the script run by itself like in the "normal" $(document).ready case?
[11:27:26] <expando-> <unknown815>
[11:27:37] <unknown815> yea :)
[11:27:42] <expando-> what if you have two nested pages with document.ready?
[11:27:55] <expando-> without load?
[11:27:59] <tripdalg> can I use something like <span data-url="whatever">Link</span> in browsers not supporting html5? I will use jQuery to do $(whatever).data('url')
[11:28:00] <expando-> just plain html
[11:28:42] <unknown815> You mean when one page is nested in the parent page already (hardcoded)?
[11:28:48] <expando-> yes
[11:28:53] <unknown815> ok, lemme check.
[11:29:40] <Danny^P> Hi! I'm searching for a good plugin to to image upload. I'd like to integrate it into a form and upload the pictures when sending the form
[11:30:40] <unknown815> expando- When I am using an iFrame, then its loading and running the script properly.
[11:31:23] <unknown815> (since $(document).ready was called)
[11:31:30] <expando-> When calling .load() using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to .html() prior to scripts being removed.
[11:31:55] <cusco> doesn't .load use innerhtml ?
[11:32:00] <expando-> "suffixed selector expression"
[11:32:07] <expando-> it is the keyword
[11:32:15] <expando-> scripts are not always executed
[11:32:17] <expando-> using load
[11:32:25] <unknown815> I am not using a suffixed selector. It is loading the whole page and scripts are included
[11:32:45] <unknown815> Thats why I am wondering.
[11:33:06] <qvarkk> are there any preexisting jquery function/easing that can mimic the slideup/down on http://chriswoods.ca/photographer/
[11:33:17] <cusco> "however, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated"
[11:33:30] <cusco> so the script is loaded but cannot handle the html being loaded yet
[11:33:48] <cusco> right?
[11:34:16] <expando-> unknown815
[11:34:24] <expando-> you can have some issues with your pages
[11:34:35] <unknown815> When calling .load() using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to .html() prior to scripts being removed. This executes the script blocks before they are discarded.
[11:34:41] <cusco> qvarkk: you mean the bottom bar, slided up?
[11:34:41] <dean[w]> idiot question: why is this invalid json: {'1': 22, '2': 20}?
[11:35:01] <qvarkk> yeah exactly, the thumbnails sliding up/down when clicked on the three-button-menu
[11:35:03] <expando-> browsers are smart and can execute them. check your code again
[11:35:07] <unknown815> In the docu they say scripts are executed? Or do I misunderstand something?
[11:36:11] <expando-> if you have events bound by .bind
[11:36:16] <expando-> it may be the reason
[11:36:29] <unknown815> Well, so the only solution is to load the script manually and then call the respective function?
[11:36:45] <unknown815> Or to include all the scripts in the mainpage
[11:37:33] <unknown815> Atm I am clicking on a accordion and run the load function within the changestart of the accordion
[11:38:00] <afidegnum> hello good evening all, pls I have a situation, I have developped a mobile page based on jquery mobile, however when viewing the page on iphone, the login frame is very nasty, pls anyone has an idea on how to adjust it?
[11:38:21] <afidegnum> here is the page. http://mobile.thel.us/
[11:38:56] <qvarkk> cusco: do you see any cheat can be made or do i have to set width/height and then animate the position absolute value?
[11:40:12] <expando-> <unknown815> - what browser you are using for the tests?
[11:40:17] <unknown815> What is the best practice when having dynamic content which itself contains java script?
[11:40:19] <unknown815> firefox
[11:40:22] <unknown815> you need version  ?
[11:40:26] <expando-> no
[11:40:28] <cusco> qvarkk: I wouldn't know.. I would animate to height
[11:40:29] <unknown815> ok
[11:40:41] <qvarkk> cusco: how do you mean
[11:41:05] <cusco> I'm not sure myself
[11:41:30] <qvarkk> =)
[11:41:39] <afidegnum> any answer ?
[11:41:39] <qvarkk> i'll try animate margin-top
[11:42:29] <expando-> <unknown815> - use callback for now. it is good an expert to see your code
[11:42:51] <expando-> i'm not an expert. i'm sorry. and i'm tired now
[11:43:17] <cusco> qvarkk: looking at that site: $('#works-nav').show().animate({ 'bottom' : 0 }, 300, function() {
[11:43:21] <unknown815> Ok, thanks anyways!

[11:45:03] <RonWhoCares> Would someone please show me how to remove all the current <select> options and then how to append the new list of options?  Here is a start:    http://jsfiddle.net/wY6m9/    The output of the .php script is in the format  <option value="#">Option Name</option>
[11:46:05] <cusco> RonWhoCares: use .remove ?
[11:46:51] <cusco> and then .ajax().apend()
[11:47:10] <RonWhoCares> I want to do it with JQuery
[11:47:16] <cusco> yes
[11:47:22] <RonWhoCares> Is that how?
[11:47:53] <tw2113> you mean i don't have to hire nanobots to do this for me? i can just use jquery?
[11:47:56] <cusco> well... yes but you have to lookup each of those.. you could start here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:55:24] <MGA555> Using datatables, setting "bAutoWidth":false for just one column in a table doesn't seem to work. How can I specify the width of one column and have the others autosized to fit the contents? thanks

[11:56:43] <RonWhoCares> Thank you cusco

[12:58:38] <mvk> i'm using a $('#mytextbox[value="0"]') selector after changing the #mytextbox.val to
[12:58:57] <mvk> i'm using a $('#mytextbox[value="0"]') selector after changing the #mytextbox.val to '10' with a checkbox
[12:59:10] <mvk> ok, let my rewrite that, sorry!
[12:59:46] <mvk> i'm using a $('.mytextboxes[value="0"]') selector after changing a certain mytextbox.val to '10' (when a checkbox is toggled)
[13:00:22] <mvk> but the textbox with val '10' is still seen as having '0', the selector returns that element too, is this a bug or am i doing something wrong?
[13:03:51] <toothrot> anyone familiar with jquery-address? I'm having an issue with firefox where when i reload, the query string seems to be encoded twice so i end up with a `%2520` in the parameters
[13:05:08] <toothrot> it seems so obvious that i feel i must be using it incorrectly
[13:12:22] <beachandbytes> do you have an example toothrot
[13:14:03] <toothrot> I'll create one
[13:20:43] <toothrot> bah, i can't get it to work in a fiddle, i guess due to the iframe
[13:23:23] <shoky> mvk: how are you changing the textbox's value?  you cannot use a selector to select by value (cause at runtime its the value _property_ that is changed, not the attribute)
[13:31:56] <mvk> shoky: using .val()
[13:32:09] <mvk> should i use, .attr('value', ?
[13:32:56] <shoky> mvk: you should  check the value with .val() too
[13:33:30] <mvk> shoky: so, i should create a filter?
[13:33:35] <mvk> i guess
[13:33:38] <shoky> mvk: if you have several of those textboxes and you want only the ones with a certain value
[13:33:44] <shoky> then yeah, filter
[13:34:19] <shoky> $('.mytextboxes').filter(function() { return this.value == '10' })   for example
[13:34:31] <shoky> $(this).val() == '10'   is fine too
[13:34:57] <mvk> shoky: but i have a couple of elements to itterate..
[13:35:29] <shoky> .filter gets you a collection
[13:35:35] <shoky> that you can iterate
[13:35:45] <beachandbytes> $('.mytextboxes').filter(function() { return this.value == '10' }).each(...
[13:35:52] <shoky> ^
[13:36:31] <mvk> .filter($('.input_percent').val() =='0') aint good?
[13:36:52] <shoky> .filter doesn't take a boolean
[13:37:00] <mvk> OK
[13:37:04] <shoky> usually you pass it a selector or a function
[13:37:16] <shoky> and i have no idea what .input_percent is..
[13:37:25] <mvk> no ok, i understand that :D
[13:52:06] <sandyd> Can someone help me with a scrolling problem I am having? I am currently using this script (http://pastebin.com/2z2AvZe3) to scroll to a website div, one at a time. The div structure is in the form (http://pastebin.com/zxD0QS9m). Yet, when I scroll, it scrolls several divs at a time
[13:52:13] <sent-hil> does jQuery have trouble finding ids with ":" in name?
[13:53:08] <sent-hil> ex. in www.google.com/calendar I'm trying to get the current week, (Sept 30 - Oct 6, 2012) in an extension, but jQuery isn't finding it, help please?
[13:53:27] <toothrot> well, i figured out the problem, when i call $.address.value('/?foo=with spaces'), the value gets passed through unencoded, when you reload, the window.location.href returns it encoded already, so when I submitted it through $.ajax, it was encoded again by jquery...
[13:55:21] <sandyd> wait - nvm I understand the problem now.
[13:55:46] <sandyd> In the script, when the scrolling animation happens, the scroll detector fires
[13:55:51] <sandyd> is there some way to stop that?
[13:57:19] <shoky> sent-hil:  escape the : with two backslashes:   \\:
[13:57:52] <sent-hil> shoky: doesn't seem to work either
[13:59:38] <shoky> sent-hil: what's your selector
[13:59:48] <shoky> and.. does it find other ids ok
[14:00:01] <sent-hil> shoky: $("#currentDate:2), yes
[14:00:18] <sent-hil> $("#gridcontainer") for ex. works
[14:00:21] <shoky> that's not escaped
[14:00:47] <sent-hil> shoky: i tried escaping, doesn't work
[14:02:01] <shoky> sent-hil: http://jsfiddle.net/bUGAR/
[14:04:45] <sent-hil> shoky: http://cl.ly/image/2t1J3Q1Z2d23 http://cl.ly/image/3n0k3F2o0029
[14:05:38] <sent-hil> must be something else
[14:07:30] <sandyd> Does anyone know how to stop scroll(function(eventObj) from firing when a scrollTop is run?
[14:08:04] <sandyd> *inside the scroll listener
[14:12:09] <shoky> sandyd: you could .unbind('scroll') to stop it from firing altogether.  you could keep it firing but have some flags that you maintain and check first thing inside e.g.  if (isScrolling) return;
[14:13:00] <sandyd> ah, thanks for the idea shoky :)
[14:13:43] <sandyd> If I unbound scroll inside the scroll function, would it still run the stuff after?
[14:14:03] <shoky> yea. it just won't call your callback again
[14:14:13] <sandyd> ah. Thanks.
[14:42:07] <twelvealpha> I've got a site that's handling video, transcoding it via zencoder. When the video processes successfully, it posts back to a given page, and that page populates with the proper video and some social media links. But while the video is in-progress or has failed transcoding, I need it to *not* display those social media links.
[14:42:48] <twelvealpha> When the video is in-progress or has failed, a div with one of two specific classes fills in on the page, so I'm trying to detect the presence of those classes, and then conditionally delete the social media div entirely.
[14:42:56] <twelvealpha> I've got this code, but it's failing silently: http://pastebin.com/XP4C7EJ5
[14:47:49] <sandyd> shoky, ive setup the new script, and it is still not working: http://pastebin.com/CZDbXhDg
[14:48:33] <sandyd> $shouldlisten=0 should be preventing the scroll listener from doing anything, even if it fires, yet it still keeps on firing?
[14:54:21] <shoky> sandyd: .animate(...) returns immediately
[14:54:36] <shoky> sandyd: putting code after the .animate(...) call doesn't mean it'll run after the animation is complete
[14:54:45] <shoky> sandyd: that's what the animation complete callback is for
[14:55:19] <sandyd> ah, so I should unregister it before I call it, then reregister it after the entire function runs
[14:55:27] <sandyd> *call .animate
[14:56:14] <shoky> $(..).animate(..., 'slow', function() { $shouldlisten = 1 })    for example
[14:56:36] <shoky> instead of:  $(..).animate(...,'slow');  $shouldlisten = 1;
[14:57:10] <sandyd> ah. That makes sense now.
[14:57:12] <sandyd> Thanks.
[15:11:44] <anew> this is strange, there is an array inside a <script> tag on the html of a page, and there is an external js file referencing the array, how is that possible ?
[15:16:58] <shoky> anew: all javascript on a page runs in the same global scope (unless you scope it in a function)
[15:22:35] <jrockjiggz> how to check if string ends with something
[15:22:53] <jrockjiggz> if( str.endsWith('something') ) ?
[15:23:04] <jrockjiggz> or in_string would be ok
[15:23:33] <anew> shoky if you have an iife unminified code (function (a, b)){  we know that a is the jQuery wrapper, but how do you figure out what b is ?
[15:24:49] <shoky> anew:  you only know that a is jQuery  if you actually pass in jQuery as the first argument
[15:25:09] <shoky> anew: like..    (function(a,b){ ... })(jQuery)
[15:25:21] <shoky> and in that example, since i dont pass a 2nd argument,  b === undefined
[15:25:54] <razzi> j_wright, try something like str.match(/something$/)
[15:25:56] <anew> so (function(a,b){ ... })(jQuery, window.E).... b = window.E ?
[15:25:58] <razzi> jrockjiggz*
[15:26:02] <shoky> anew: yep
[15:26:06] <jrockjiggz> razzi: thanks
[15:26:41] <anew> and if b is undefined how do you figure what's passed into it ?
[15:27:13] <shoky> anew: if its undefined then you know that either nothing was passed, or undefined was passed
[15:27:31] <shoky> and you should usually treat those 2 in the same way
[15:28:21] <anew> very good
[15:29:06] <anew> so shoky can you pass a js file in as the second parameter ? i.e. window.E.loader('myfile.js') (function(a, b)){....}(jQuery, window.E);
[15:29:17] <shoky> huh?
[15:29:42] <shoky> if you pass window.E
[15:29:46] <shoky> then window.E is passed.
[15:30:00] <shoky> whatever properties window.E had , you can access through b
[15:33:15] <anew> thx shoky
[16:46:18] <phonebook_> is there a good way with jquery/css/an svg library to make a circle that is broken apart into segments orbit/rotate around something?
[16:48:07] <Eviltwin> I'd do that in canvas
[16:49:44] <phonebook_> i was hoping it could be done with a border radius and border dotted and then css rotate and a timer? ... i just want to highlight a link im working on for dev
[16:50:04] <phonebook_> but i suck at math so
[16:50:35] <phonebook_> ah
[16:50:44] <phonebook_> hold on ill share ig i get it.. i have an idea
[16:53:01] <razzi> phonebook_, you can do that using just CSS
[16:53:07] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/eMNjj/
[16:54:49] <phonebook_> yep yep, just like that, only moving.... am working on another thing right this second but this looks promising http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11093195/how-to-dynamically-rotate-the-circle-on-every-click-using-jquery-javascript-css
[16:56:40] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/eMNjj/1/
[16:56:56] <phonebook_> wow dude
[16:57:07] <phonebook_> im not even joking that is seriously amazing
[16:57:12] <phonebook_> thx!
[17:00:52] <phonebook_> is that going to be incorporated into the css3 standard or will it be supported in ie10?
[17:33:10] <beasty> morning guys
[17:38:44] <sent-hil> how do i setup a div to have own vertical scroll bar while occupying 100% screen height
[17:39:18] <coldhead> #magic {height:100%; overflow-y: scroll}
[17:40:52] <sent-hil> coldhead: then it just extends the page's scroll bar
[17:41:10] <sent-hil> i mean it appends to the page and the page gets a scroll bar
[17:44:17] <coldhead> i may misunderstand the question
[17:44:28] <coldhead> if you append a giant div to a page then the page gets a scroll bar
[17:45:14] <sent-hil> coldhead: i'm building a chrome extension to show additional info on right side of the calendars
[17:45:38] <sent-hil> the calendars have its own scroll bar, now i want to the div on the right to have its own scroll bar as well, but the page shouldn't have one
[17:45:52] <sent-hil> this way the user can scroll both calendar and the div bars easily
[17:47:30] <gabrieluk> why not make a lil draw to reproduce? may a jsfidle?
[17:47:52] <sent-hil> gabrieluk: reproduce google cal on jsfiddle?
[17:48:13] <gabrieluk> no, just how you think to implement
[17:48:37] <gabrieluk> nvm, i can't follow you
[17:49:12] <coldhead> i can't get an inner scroll to work properly here http://jsfiddle.net/bmh8V/
[17:49:17] <coldhead> very annoying actualy
[17:52:15] <coldhead> try ##css maybe
[17:52:21] <coldhead> i yieldeth
[17:53:21] <sent-hil> coldhead: trying it out now, thx!
[17:53:22] <mouses> i have a <div> w/ padding containing <p> text. i want the background of the div to be black with .5 opacity and the text to have opacity of 1 so it's not transparent. setting the opacity of the div cascades to the text regardless... is my best bet to remove the <p> from within the <div>?
[17:54:12] <coldhead> just set the opacity of the background-color, mouses
[17:54:19] <coldhead> use RGBA syntax
[17:54:37] <coldhead> background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)
[17:54:44] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[17:55:32] <mouses> lemme try
[18:02:46] <mouses> coldhead: awesome, that worked! is that a known issue with css or something?
[18:03:10] <mouses> thanks
[18:06:00] <coldhead> its expected behaviour
[18:06:09] <coldhead> opacity: affects parent and all children
[18:06:23] <coldhead> specifying an opacity for a background colour only affects that colour
[18:06:24] <mouses> k
[18:06:33] <mouses> oic
[18:07:09] <coldhead> i think we've all learned something valuable today
[18:07:12] <coldhead> let's take five
[18:07:15] <coldhead> great work everyone
[18:22:30] <phonebook_> an hour and a half after learning a 3 second css trick i just managed to get vs2012 to upload
[18:22:50] <phonebook_> those are the kinds of ratios i like
[18:23:35] <Lucky--> sounds like type spent debugging javascript just ot realize u missed one self = this var
[18:23:51] <Lucky--> yet end up with some completely wierd and obscure message that steers you in the wrong direction
[18:24:07] <phonebook_> theres my god damned spinning circle http://www.dateequalsnull.com/
[18:24:29] <phonebook_> doesnt even do me any good cause i had to change it to 4.0 and everything is hard coded
[18:34:57] <ralf_> hey, how can i set or just close the connection for a get request? i did "jqXHR.setRequestHeader ('Connection', 'close');" but this seams to have no effect
[19:30:56] <KorvinSzanto> I have a request loop that runs and gets data from a php script, for some reason it stops working after a few minute
[19:30:59] <KorvinSzanto> minutes*
[19:31:06] <AndreKR> Hi
[19:31:17] <KorvinSzanto> does anyone know why that would happen?
[19:31:20] <AndreKR> Where is this plugin that is described on http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins:Forms?
[19:36:35] <KorvinSzanto> I have a setup like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7s6JZ/
[19:36:49] <KorvinSzanto> after 10 minutes or so, the stream will just stop
[19:37:01] <KorvinSzanto> no requests in, tons going out
[20:21:28] <Pasq89> i have an input.. and sometimes it has default value (given with php..) i want those times (when value != ""), to do something...
[20:22:05] <Pasq89> i tried the document.ready .. if $(input).val()!="" , but didnt worked!
[20:29:51] <shoky> ?demo @ Pasq89
[20:29:52] <bot-t> Pasq89, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:43:46] <TiffanyAmber> hi
[20:43:48] <TiffanyAmber> someone around
[20:44:59] <Jetbeard> i'm around
[20:46:03] <Jetbeard> TiffanyAmber tell me your problems
[20:46:07] <Jetbeard> and i will turn them into solutions
[20:46:08] <Jetbeard> with SCIENCE
[20:46:21] <Jetbeard> but on the other hand i am drunk
[20:56:22] <TiffanyAmber> alright
[20:56:40] <TiffanyAmber> There is a way to grab an email that is being sent?
[20:56:43] <TiffanyAmber> with jquery?
[20:56:45] <TiffanyAmber> through a form
[21:07:26] <Jetbeard> TiffanyAmber, yes
[21:07:33] <Jetbeard> wait
[21:07:49] <TiffanyAmber> ?
[21:07:51] <Jetbeard> you have a form that, through some backend process, sends an email
[21:08:00] <Jetbeard> ?
[21:08:20] <TiffanyAmber> mmm
[21:08:26] <TiffanyAmber> I'm actually using a service
[21:08:29] <TiffanyAmber> something outside my site
[21:08:33] <TiffanyAmber> that sends the email
[21:08:40] <TiffanyAmber> its a service that opens a popup
[21:08:47] <TiffanyAmber> where the user inputs the name and email
[21:08:55] <TiffanyAmber> and when they hit send, it goes through their own channel
[21:09:04] <TiffanyAmber> so I don't know what's going on in there, can't access that form
[21:09:05] <TiffanyAmber> at all
[21:09:13] <TiffanyAmber> can I still grab it? the email?
[21:09:16] <TiffanyAmber> its my site though
[21:09:32] <TiffanyAmber> but just the popup (lightbox) is not in my site but loading from outside
[21:10:41] <Jetbeard> you may be able to inject some javascript code into the popup
[21:11:00] <Jetbeard> though it's likely that you can't do that for security reasons (it's just XSS)
[21:11:07] <TiffanyAmber> mmmm yes
[21:11:12] <TiffanyAmber> I don't want to disturb anythin
[21:11:13] <TiffanyAmber> anything
[21:11:27] <Jetbeard> you may be able to investigate the form that the user is shown
[21:11:36] <Jetbeard> and make your *own* form which submits to the same place
[21:14:42] <TiffanyAmber> the problem is actually that when it emails me with the user info, I get a "reply-to" field which is okay, but the gmail autoresponder doesn't picks that one up
[21:15:55] <TiffanyAmber> you know
[21:41:26] <Nomikos> I have a page that can show a bunch of different "dialog" windows, all with different scripts and ajaxing going on
[21:41:53] <Nomikos> is it ok to load in the relevant scripts along with the html needed for the dialog?
[21:42:26] <Nomikos> so the user clicks a button says "feedback", that dialog is fetched from the server, along with the script handling submit
[21:42:54] <Nomikos> or is it possible that the return script will not get parsed by the browser?
[22:50:51] <angelazou> how do I create an object whose properties are arrays that contain arrays?
[22:51:24] <angelazou> I'm doing this var temp = { ['arr': [temp1, temp2, temp3]] };
[22:51:38] <angelazou> but I'm getting a whole bunch of error messages
[22:53:55] <Nomikos> object is a list of name: value pairs, you are missing the name
[22:54:47] <Nomikos> and an array doesn't have names, just items (or numerical keys), so ["foo":"bar"] is not valid either
[22:55:03] <Nomikos> var temp = {'arr': [temp1, temp2, temp3] }; // this should work though?
[22:56:09] <Nomikos> angelazou: temp1 etc can be arrays, or you nest them directly like var temp = { 'arr': [[sub, array, goes, here], [..]] };
[22:59:08] <angelazou> Nomikos: thanks
[23:13:14] <DonCabrera> hi
[23:13:16] <DonCabrera> someone here
[23:14:05] <Nomikos> o/
[23:14:47] <DonCabrera> no?
[23:15:08] <DonCabrera> \s
[23:15:09] <Nomikos> that was a little dude waving "hi!"
[23:15:17] <DonCabrera> o
[23:15:26] <DonCabrera> I'm trying to do something with js
[23:15:31] <DonCabrera> I have this page
[23:15:34] <DonCabrera> that opens an iframe
[23:15:39] <DonCabrera> well, it's a popup
[23:15:46] <DonCabrera> kind of like one of these lightboxes
[23:15:50] <DonCabrera> and has an iframe in it
[23:16:00] <DonCabrera> it gets activated through a js
[23:16:21] <DonCabrera> ahh forget it. Don't know why I ask here anyway.
[23:16:23] <DonCabrera> deserted.
[23:16:39] <Nomikos> uh, ok. good luck I guess :-)
[23:16:45] <DonCabrera> yeah
[23:16:50] <DonCabrera> www.cabrerabrothers/connery/
[23:16:53] <DonCabrera> check it out if you want to
[23:17:15] <DonCabrera> sorry, was liek this

[23:18:58] <j_wright> use one of the bootstrap things
[23:19:23] <j_wright> since you're already using that
[23:21:22] <Nomikos> looks like a fun game
[23:22:36] <Nomikos> DonCabrera: Bladerunner meets Neuromancer?
[23:26:00] <j_wright> DonCabrera: use a modal?
[23:28:17] <DonCabrera> mmm yes, that's not the issue actually
[23:28:27] <DonCabrera> the problem is that I want to set my autoresponders to send the promo code
[23:28:35] <DonCabrera> but the stupid gmail don't picks up the reply-to
[23:28:37] <DonCabrera> from emails
[23:28:40] <DonCabrera> only the "from"
[23:28:47] <DonCabrera> so they get send to a @noreply
[23:28:49] <DonCabrera> instead of the guy
[23:28:52] <DonCabrera> and I have to do it manually
[23:34:03] <jrockjiggz> i have url: tutorial/blog as a string.  How can i extract 'blog' (after the /)?
[23:35:11] <jrockjiggz> I guess i can use str.substring(str.lastIndexOf("/") + 1, str.length);
[23:35:45] <jrockjiggz> or vars.split('/'); lastVar = vars.pop()
[23:35:56] <Nomikos> or .slice()
[23:50:42] <chovy> how do i set a cookie with jquery?
[23:50:52] <ukukuk> document.cookie = ''
[23:51:10] <ukukuk> ah.. jquery: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[23:51:18] <Nomikos> and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458724/how-to-set-unset-cookie-with-jquery
