[01:28:31] <cluelessperson> does anyone know a good rtc library?
[01:29:08] <Cork> rtc?
[01:33:33] <cluelessperson> webrtc
[01:33:55] <Cork> hmm, no not that is still alive
[01:34:01] <Cork> never really needed webrtc
[03:35:54] <hellyeah> hey
[03:36:00] <hellyeah> i have a table which has many rows
[03:36:15] <hellyeah> i just want to calculate how many columns there are in one row
[03:36:19] <hellyeah> how can i do that?
[03:40:03] <hellyeah> is there any short way for that?
[03:40:40] <Cork> is it rows or tables this time?
[03:48:13] <hellyeah> table
[03:49:04] <Cork> that would make it quite a bit harder as you don't have a structure you can depend on
[03:49:39] <Cork> hellyeah: so again, don't call a list of tables rows
[03:49:48] <Cork> it makes it very hard to give you correct answer
[03:49:49] <Cork> +s
[03:50:07] <hellyeah> no no
[03:50:14] <hellyeah> it is actual table now with markup
[03:50:23] <hellyeah> accurate markup
[03:50:50] <Cork> then just find the tr and do .children().length
[03:51:03] <Cork> .closest('tr') if it is inside the tr
[03:51:56] <hellyeah> I understand
[04:22:21] <hellyeah> please check line 122 -146 and line 2 i just want to give each element to spesific td what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/4/click VT button
[04:23:20] <Cork> dont
[04:23:28] <Cork> don't use attr('style'
[04:23:35] <Cork> usopps
[04:23:45] <Cork>  i meant don't use attr('class'
[04:24:05] <Cork> use addClass
[04:24:26] <hellyeah> ah
[04:24:55] <Cork> also why don't you just do this in the map loop?
[04:25:02] <Cork> (line 39)
[04:25:22] <Cork> hmm correction line 43
[04:25:50] <Cork> td = $('<td>', { class: vantilatorArrForDynamicalTable[i] })
[04:28:27] <hellyeah> Cork,  did you mean this https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/8/ ?
[04:28:43] <hellyeah> still doesnt work i cannot see the class=".."
[04:28:47] <Cork> no
[04:29:21] <Cork> i meant https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/9/
[04:30:06] <Cork> also as a side note css have nth-child, so you don't really need those classes
[04:30:47] <hellyeah> well
[04:30:53] <hellyeah> i will connect wiith database
[04:31:00] <hellyeah> and i will update spesific column
[04:31:10] <hellyeah> database table has that column to
[04:31:17] <Cork> prob better to store that as a data-column or something
[04:31:21] <Cork> or even data-name
[04:31:43] <hellyeah> but there is a problem in jsfiddle you gave me
[04:31:44] <Cork> and i would prob just store it statically in the template for the thead
[04:31:50] <hellyeah> Cork, i will keep that in my mind
[04:32:31] <hellyeah> i dont know how to fix that
[04:32:41] <hellyeah> they will deleteVantilator to wrong place
[04:33:18] <hellyeah> it may be because of upperLimit - 1
[04:33:56] <hellyeah> hmm you understand the problem
[04:34:34] <Cork> not really, calc is never used so...?
[04:35:07] <hellyeah> i mean just check the developer tools
[04:35:12] <Cork> ah, you had a for loop inside the each loop
[04:35:22] <Cork> didn't see that cause the indentation was all over the place
[04:35:37] <hellyeah> oh i am sorry
[04:35:39] <hellyeah> gimme a sec
[04:35:58] <hellyeah> always forgot to do that i am sorry https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/11/ here
[04:36:17] <hellyeah> if you check developer tools you will see that first td didnt have a class
[04:36:23] <Cork> but... what is that for loop suppose to do??
[04:36:25] <hellyeah> it should have deleteVantilator class
[04:36:34] <Cork> it replaces the class over and over again
[04:37:23] <hellyeah> last link i gave you doesnt have a for loop
[04:37:30] <Cork> ah, now i get where you got confused
[04:37:31] <hellyeah> Cork,  yeah i realized
[04:37:43] <Cork> .each is already a loop, you don't need to for loop it again
[04:37:58] <hellyeah> I see
[04:37:59] <Cork> so element[i] isn't valid
[04:38:32] <Cork> so what are you actually trying to do here?
[04:38:59] <hellyeah> i just tried something thats not sensible
[04:39:06] <hellyeah> and i just stucked :p
[04:39:13] <Cork> ya td / tr doesn't really make sense...
[04:39:33] <Cork> you want to add the column for each tr in the row right?
[04:39:43] <hellyeah> yeah
[04:39:50] <hellyeah> i try to add class to each column
[04:39:56] <hellyeah> from id to equipment
[04:39:58] <Cork> then 8 should be close enough to what you ask for...
[04:40:07] <hellyeah> and i will repeat in each row
[04:40:14] <hellyeah> line 8?
[04:40:19] <hellyeah> ops
[04:40:21] <Cork> no i meant fiddle 8
[04:40:32] <Cork> i need to figure out why it didn't do the correct thing
[04:41:02] <hellyeah> this is close enough https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/11/
[04:41:09] <hellyeah> just there is one issue here
[04:41:22] <hellyeah> that is it doesnt give class to first column
[04:41:37] <hellyeah> that give the class of first column to second column
[04:41:48] <hellyeah> you will see delete monitor is class of td id
[04:42:13] <hellyeah> hope you understand
[04:43:43] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/xp9019ra/13/ should be correct
[04:44:16] <Cork> i moved deleteVantilator from the dynamic class variable into the static td appended before the loop
[04:44:22] <Cork> and looks like everything is correct now
[04:45:29] <hellyeah> oh i see
[04:46:13] <hellyeah> why did it happen like that? i am not really clear on that?
[04:46:44] <Cork> hellyeah: the for loop looking for the index loops after the delete cell has been added
[04:46:52] <Cork> so the entire thing gets offset by one
[04:47:06] <Cork> by removing the class not in the dynamic loop and instead having it static in the td
[04:47:10] <Cork> things sync up again
[04:49:35] <cluelessperson> anyone here ever mess with RTC?
[04:51:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:51:21] <Cork> cluelessperson: might be worth asking in #javascript
[04:51:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[04:51:30] <Cork> isn't really jquery related
[04:52:13] <hellyeah> thanks Cork
[04:52:15] <hellyeah> appreciated
[04:52:19] <Cork> np
[04:55:31] <cluelessperson> ah
[07:55:59] <Xatenev> hi
[07:56:06] <Xatenev> when i perform an ajax call with dataType: 'script'
[07:56:13] <Xatenev> should I be able to use the variables it defines globally?
[07:57:11] <Cork> depends on whats in the response
[07:57:13] <Cork> but yes
[07:57:23] <Xatenev> it doesnt seem to work for me
[07:57:26] <Cork> to not though, it has to wait for the response to be evaluated
[07:57:32] <Cork> so sync executing won't work
[07:57:34] <Xatenev> yea that makes sense
[07:57:36] <Xatenev> well
[07:57:38] <Cork> as it iwll always run first
[07:57:39] <Xatenev> imagine i am doing:
[07:58:00] <Xatenev> async: false, dataType: 'script' crossDomain: false, timeout: 10000 url: something
[07:58:02] <Xatenev> those are my settings
[07:58:13] <Cork> async: false is depricated, and you should not use it
[07:58:22] <Xatenev> Cork, this is the included file https://bpaste.net/show/c65fbcbb27a5
[07:58:25] <Cork> (not only cause it is depricated)
[07:58:38] <Xatenev> now when i type in console.log(appba213r); the result is undefined
[07:58:47] <Xatenev> even though my dev tools autocomplete appba213r
[08:00:52] <Xatenev> Cork, any idea? :\
[08:01:13] <Xatenev> (it doesnt work when i rmeove the async thing so its not that atleast)
[08:01:14] <Cork> Xatenev: https://jsfiddle.net/4ffw9xbg/
[08:02:17] <Cork> Xatenev: though note type: 'script' uses eval, so if you have that disabled with csp type: 'script' won't work
[08:02:32] <Xatenev> Cork, ok i got it
[08:02:38] <Xatenev> it seems i had a syntax error in the included file
[08:02:42] <Xatenev> crazy - I didnt get any error at all
[08:02:57] <Cork> but again, you should really REALLY not use async: false
[08:03:09] <Cork> it is terrible for user experience
[08:38:45] <sonicdriver_awes> async:false in ajax for passing variable to function?
[08:39:05] <sonicdriver_awes> instead of doing that why not calling function inside success callback
[08:39:30] <Cork> sonicdriver_awes: not for passing to function
[08:39:52] <Cork> but old javascript code is often written as function callback(query) { return result; }
[08:40:06] <Cork> but ya async: false, is always a bad choice
[08:41:38] <sonicdriver_awes> actually i dont know the exact reason of that
[08:41:39] <Cork> the reason it is so bad is cause it forces the javascript engine to stall until the network request, server processing and response is done
[08:42:04] <Cork> if in that case for example the network dies or the server has problem
[08:42:13] <Cork> the page hangs, and you can't even get scroll updates
[08:42:34] <Cork> (as the browser aren't allowed to reflow the page while javascript is processing)
[08:43:10] <Cork> so it results in a really bad user experience
[08:43:39] <sonicdriver_awes> oh understand now
[08:44:41] <Cork> google groups used to be a good example of this
[08:44:51] <Cork> thankfully they have fixed that
[08:45:08] <sonicdriver_awes> I see
[09:22:44] <anki> Hello All,
[09:22:44] <anki> I am using datatables.It is possible to hide column of datatables from external place using jQuery ?
[09:23:36] <Cork> anki: https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/hidden_columns.html
[09:24:18] <anki> Thanks for reply.I already see this.But this is not what i am looking for
[09:24:38] <anki> I would like to hide/show column from external checkboxes
[09:24:49] <Cork> ya, and that page talks about that
[09:25:37] <anki> Nope.It is static
[09:25:44] <anki> I am looking for like toogle.
[09:25:51] <Cork> "The column that is hidden is still part of the table and can be made visible through the api column().visible() API method at a future time if you wish to have columns which can be shown and hidden."
[09:26:18] <Cork> so again yes it is
[09:26:24] <hellyeah> you may just add/remove Class to the spesific td
[09:26:27] <hellyeah> or something
[09:26:36] <Cork> no that would break the plugin
[09:26:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:26:57] <Cork> it has an option, just toggle it
[09:29:06] <anki> Trying to do same
[09:41:17] <anki> Thanks,It is working
[09:41:20] <anki> :)
[11:24:14] <lissitzki> hi I can't understand why this script is not working anymore
[11:24:15] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/e2zvr147/
[11:24:28] <lissitzki> i add an h4
[11:24:41] <lissitzki> in css script and html
[11:25:53] <taplar> so what kind of debugging did we talk about yesterday that you can do?
[11:26:07] <lissitzki> ehi
[11:26:22] <lissitzki> well the loop is on 0
[11:27:41] <lissitzki> so i think the selector is not working
[11:27:49] <lissitzki> also because is the thing i moved
[11:28:01] <taplar> ok, so start debugging it
[11:28:28] <lissitzki> selector is $('#menu > ul > li > h4 > a')
[11:29:04] <taplar> so what does that selector say?
[11:29:15] <lissitzki> on css is #menu > ul > li > h4 >a { display: none; }
[11:29:29] <taplar> read that selector to me in english
[11:29:45] <lissitzki> it search for an a nested in h4  nested in li in ul
[11:30:06] <taplar> is that it?
[11:30:19] <lissitzki> with an id menu
[11:30:24] <taplar> no
[11:30:35] <taplar> that's not what that says
[11:31:14] <taplar> you correctly associated > with nesting, but then you decided it means 'with' on the final part?
[11:31:32] <taplar> :)
[11:31:44] <lissitzki> eheh
[11:32:47] <lissitzki> so #menu should nest all the rest
[11:33:01] <taplar> that's what that selector is looking for
[11:33:05] <taplar> but does that match your markup?
[11:34:13] <lissitzki> no
[11:34:34] <lissitzki> it should be #menu >  li > h4 >a
[11:34:40] <lissitzki> without ul?
[11:34:58] <taplar> it could be, sure
[11:35:22] <lissitzki> stillnot working
[11:38:11] <taplar> fiddle?
[11:40:05] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/e2zvr147/5/
[11:40:25] <lissitzki> wait there i deleted a as well
[11:40:38] <taplar> you don't have jquery included either
[11:41:26] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/e2zvr147/7/
[11:41:45] <lissitzki> but is the same code of yesterday..
[11:43:01] <taplar> see in the top left part of the javascript section?
[11:43:07] <lissitzki> i did
[11:43:11] <lissitzki> it's working
[11:43:19] <lissitzki> thanks again
[11:43:28] <taplar> k
[11:43:48] <MikeD_> if i want to clear some data when a number in an input is 'changed' i use the change event... but that doesn't fire until blur...
[11:44:17] <taplar> there's an 'input' event
[11:44:42] <taplar> fires any time the value of the input changes, even before blur
[11:44:44] <MikeD_> does that fire on backspacing a letter?
[11:44:51] <taplar> anything that changes the value
[11:44:51] <MikeD_> oh, nice.
[11:45:28] <MikeD_> is that a jquery feature or a javascript feature wrapped?
[11:45:41] <taplar> i want to say a vanilla thing
[11:46:12] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[11:47:04] <MikeD_> thanks, i probably should've checked that myself
[11:49:48] <taplar> it's cool.  you're distracting me from converting an arbitration agreement into html
[11:51:32] <MikeD_> so do you think there's any need to listen on change if you're already listening on input?
[11:52:01] <taplar> i'd have to test to see if pasting also causes the input to happen
[11:52:08] <MikeD_> it does
[11:52:08] <taplar> if it does, i'd just use the input event
[11:52:42] <MikeD_> i'm thinking the same
[12:50:45] <poboy> looking over the docs, I have to use an integer for .eq()  but can't use a variable that equals an integer?
[12:50:58] <taplar> sure you can
[12:51:11] <poboy> $('#bkDebtorSelect_' + j + ' option:eq(1)').val();     I have var key that I pass in but get undefined
[12:51:24] <markh> that's a string
[12:51:42] <taplar> ' option:eq('+ variable +')'
[12:51:51] <poboy> derp.   thanks
[12:52:06] <taplar> i thought you were talking about the eq() method
[12:52:06] <markh> :)
[12:56:16] <Guest81970> ola
[12:56:23] <Guest81970> seniores
[12:56:32] <z1haze> can you continue chaining after .fail() with a $.Deferred ?
[12:56:37] <z1haze> like you can with a normal promise?
[12:56:54] <taplar> should be able to
[12:56:59] <z1haze> do you just use .done?
[12:57:11] <z1haze> .done().fail().done() ?
[12:57:29] <taplar> fail() returns the Promise object according to the docs
[12:57:49] <taplar> i'm not sure why you'd do done.fail.done
[12:59:23] <z1haze> well with a normal promise you can .catch() and then continue on
[12:59:40] <z1haze> so .catch(() => fixMyProblem).then(continue
[12:59:55] <taplar> you can catch() with 3x
[13:02:24] <z1haze> wish i could.
[13:08:12] <Guest81970> anyone here knwo jsrender

[14:59:15] <devi8> Does anybody know how to get codepen to refresh without reloading the page?
[15:00:00] <taplar> sounds like black magic
[15:01:55] <devi8> Oh how things have changed in this channel. Used to be full of helpful, eager folks who participated in an environment of lively discussion. Now, it seems a lot like #css.
[15:02:29] <taplar> i mean, it is #jquery.  not #codepen
[15:03:00] <taplar> and i'm not clear on what you're asking.  are you asking if codepen has a way of asynchronously updating itself?
[15:03:21] <z1haze> how can i get the actual scroll position because $(document).scrollTop() doesnt seem to give me what I need
[15:04:21] <devi8> I'm trying to put a question together using codepen and it seems to just not refresh some times. Once I get it done, I'll be able to post the code here for help. I was trying to follow the rules and thought someone in this channel would have a little more experience with codepen than I do
[15:21:48] <z1haze> devi8, codepen is pretty easy to use
[15:22:12] <devi8> I have problems with it where I modify a ton of code and it doesn't update
[15:22:35] <devi8> And there's no "REFRESH or UPDATE" button, so I reload the page over and over
[15:22:55] <taplar> Is there not the save button?
[15:23:10] <devi8> Doesn't help, really. Tried that first of course.
[15:23:36] <taplar> i mean, i just did a save, made a change, saved, and it persisted the change
[15:25:13] <devi8> It works some of the time, but not always. And I haven't found what causes it to hang
[15:25:38] <devi8> I think I'm gonna try in an incognito window. Maybe I have an extension caching my pages or something
[15:26:41] <taplar> you could always swap to jsfiddle or another paste site
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[16:09:37] <taplar> yup
[16:50:51] <Smokuilin> Hey guys
[16:50:59] <Smokuilin> I found a codepen tutorial that does a neat thing I'd like to recreate
[16:51:00] <Smokuilin> But
[16:51:13] <Smokuilin> Under Pen settings > Javascript this is listed
[16:51:13] <Smokuilin> /cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js
[16:51:22] <Smokuilin> Can I use this on my own WP site and how do I do that?
[16:55:56] <robertmaxrees> use what?
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> the code in the pen orrr....?
[16:57:19] <devi8> Smokuilin, that is the jquery library...it gets loaded by WordPress so I don't think you have to worry about it
[17:26:09] <Renari> Does anyone know why this selector is matching #document 12 times? https://i.imgur.com/LgDfMPE.png
[17:26:29] <robertmaxrees> Renari because you're using a fat arrow.
[17:26:52] <robertmaxrees> fat arrows can't have their context bound, so jquery can't make 'this' the element.
[17:26:53] <Renari> I wasn't aware that had any functional changes from using a function declaration.
[17:27:00] <Renari> I see
[17:27:06] <Renari> Thanks
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> there are a few differences.
[17:27:27] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[17:27:44] <Renari> Thanks
[17:27:47] <robertmaxrees> yep
[18:12:13] <devi8> in jquery ui sortable, how do you modify the item you are dragging when you start dragging it?
[18:12:15] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/aEPrYR?editors=1111
[18:12:45] <devi8> I thought I could use the "start" event, but it does some strange things.
