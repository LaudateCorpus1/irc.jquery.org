[00:12:12] <cuppy> I'm using (basically - my CSS path is longer) $('span').insertAfter('hello'); // and it's inserting it between the <span> and </span>. Is this normal, and if so, how do I specify to insertAfter the closing tag?
[00:24:33] <z1haze2> I am combining and minifying all of my vendor js files, and when i combine then im getting some weird errors about undefined functions but when i look in the files, they are there

[02:20:37] <jac0bz1> Good morning/evning! I'm looking for a script/app that allows for creating html content (not entire webpages) in an drag/drop way. (like atomic.io) What ever it costs, i dont care. Today we use zedity.com but it's to bloated and large, and the interface is to "cartoonish".. Anyone that could point me in the right direction? Whatever search I do, I end up at some wordpress content builder.. no
[02:20:37] <jac0bz1> flash!
[03:13:26] <robhol> jac0bz1: ew.
[03:13:40] <robhol> Define html content?
[03:39:16] <jac0bz1> robhol: Like a "poster" advertising the price of todays special
[03:42:26] <hellyeah> yo
[03:42:36] <hellyeah> i am sorry but what did i do wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/2om5xody/
[03:45:05] <Uhkis> hellyeah: forgot jquery for one
[03:45:41] <hellyeah> sorry,
[03:45:59] <hellyeah> here https://jsfiddle.net/2om5xody/1/
[03:46:01] <Cork> hellyeah: unless the server is broken you shouldn't do JSON.parse on the response data
[03:46:24] <Cork> cause you would be doing it in an already parsed object
[03:47:06] <hellyeah> i am just newbie i am reading tutorials actually and try to understand the suggestion. So you said when you do stringify it is already parsed and it is json object?
[03:47:23] <Cork> parse not stringify
[03:47:33] <Cork> stringify is correct that you need to encode the data you send to the server
[03:47:53] <Cork> but as you ask for json you would get the parsed result from the success callback (jquery will parse it)
[03:48:01] <hellyeah> you mean i dont need parse but necessary to use stringify
[03:48:03] <Cork> unless the server lies in it content-type header
[03:48:08] <Cork> yes
[03:48:14] <hellyeah> ah okey
[03:48:25] <hellyeah> Cork: jquery do it automatically?
[03:48:42] <Cork> if the server correctly puts Content-Type: application/json
[03:48:48] <Cork> in the response header
[03:48:53] <hellyeah> ic
[03:49:05] <Cork> if the server lies and say Content-Type: text/html
[03:49:26] <Cork> (the default unless the server set the correct header specifically)
[03:49:31] <hellyeah> contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
[03:49:31] <hellyeah>             dataType: "json", this two lines are good to use then
[03:49:36] <Cork> then jquery will listen to what the server says
[03:49:46] <Cork> hellyeah: that is what the browser will ask for
[03:49:54] <Cork> the server controls what is actually sent
[03:50:16] <Cork> dataType: "json" results in Accept: application/json, */*
[03:50:26] <hellyeah> so in html side i need content type besides content type in jquery file
[03:50:35] <Cork> and if the server sends text/html the client will take it as it sent text and not json
[03:50:46] <Cork> hellyeah: no not html side, server
[03:51:08] <Cork> the web server if it isn't a script, or the script language if it is (php, or what ever)
[03:51:20] <hellyeah> i am using asp.net
[03:51:27] <Cork> ok so asp then
[03:51:46] <hellyeah> so i need to serialize what i try to send?
[03:51:50] <Cork> just make sure the response header is Content-Type: application/json
[03:51:56] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[03:52:08] <Cork> hellyeah: it isn't about the body of the response
[03:52:13] <Cork> it is about what the server says it is sending
[03:52:16] <hellyeah> ic
[03:52:38] <hellyeah> need to check how to set content-type: application/json in asp.net
[03:52:42] <Cork> so open the browser network console
[03:52:48] <Cork> and when the request goes through
[03:52:50] <hellyeah> okey
[03:52:54] <Cork> check what the response header says
[03:52:59] <Cork> check for Content-Type
[03:55:06] <hellyeah> Cork: i am in network tab
[03:55:52] <hellyeah> how to check content-type here
[03:56:07] <Cork> check the last 4 lines i wrote...
[03:57:43] <hellyeah> couldnt see response header on network tab let me go on looking
[04:01:19] <km4> hi
[04:01:52] <km4> have problem with  $('.product_current_mini').mouseover(function(){}); dont work and $().on('mouseover',function(){});
[04:02:20] <Cork> km4: does the selector match the element you want?
[04:02:32] <Cork> meaning have you tested so it actually finds the element?
[04:04:29] <km4> Cork: yes :P need more selector :P missed li
[04:04:44] <km4> but on('mouseover',fns) is correct ?
[04:04:51] <Cork> yes
[04:05:03] <Cork> though you might want mouseenter instead of mouseover
[04:05:04] <hellyeah> brb
[04:24:19] <km4> Cork: how to correct change href <a> when i mousover small images http://jsfiddle.net/zckyw3qL/ ?
[04:26:15] <hellyeah> Cork: let me ask a question datatype:"" is for what function in backend return right?
[04:26:40] <Cork> dataType is for what content type the browser should ask for
[04:27:07] <Cork> km4: http://jsfiddle.net/zckyw3qL/1/
[04:28:23] <hellyeah> hmm so if datatype is json do i need "Content-type", "text/json" in the server side?
[04:28:39] <hellyeah> beside this "Content-type", "application/json"
[04:28:41] <Cork> uh
[04:29:13] <Cork> hellyeah: like i said before dataType: "json" sets Accept: application/json, */* in the request headers
[04:29:29] <hellyeah> i am search and i find the answer but there is two suggestions http://stackoverflow.com/questions/894828/creating-a-json-header-on-asp-net
[04:29:32] <Cork> it means the browser tells the server "if you can return multiple data types please give me json"
[04:29:43] <Cork> if the server doesn't support multiple types
[04:29:51] <Cork> it just ignores the accept header and sends what it has
[04:30:08] <Cork> then the browser/jquery checks the Content-Type in the response header
[04:30:12] <Cork> and acts accordingly
[04:30:12] <hellyeah> my function in backend return string now
[04:30:18] <Cork> uh...
[04:30:23] <Cork> your still just checking the body
[04:30:27] <Cork> not the headers
[04:30:49] <Cork> yes everything you send in http is "string"
[04:31:01] <Cork> but the content-type is what it should be interpreted as
[04:31:42] <hellyeah> sorry i am new on this topic
[04:33:14] <Cork> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers
[04:35:22] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:37:10] <StyXman> is this a proper place to ask about jquery datatables (datatables.net)?
[04:37:32] <Cork> StyXman: proper yes, but you might have to ask a few times to find someone with an answer
[04:37:50] <Cork> cause as far as i know it isn't that many around that uses it
[04:39:27] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/sdg342hL/7/ <--- how can I send multiple checkboxes's values in the ajax call?
[04:40:00] <Cork> Kartagis: don't use a gigantic string
[04:40:05] <Cork> it becomes impossible to manage
[04:40:12] <Cork> use an object and add the values to it
[04:40:20] <Cork> or use an array with name/value combinations
[04:40:38] <StyXman> ok, I'm using datatables 1.9 (I have no saying on this) and I'm properly activating it in a table, but it doesn't see the data already in the table. here's the debug output: http://debug.datatables.net/uzoyux 0 columns, 0 rows, but the DOM table has 4 rows (1 for headers) and 5 columns. any ideas?
[04:41:37] <Kartagis> Cork: this territory is new to me, and this code is for a project that's overdue. I may try to convert to that format later
[04:41:54] <Kartagis> for now, how can I achieve that?
[04:41:55] <Cork> Kartagis: i wouldn't aim for that
[04:42:09] <Kartagis> aim for what?
[04:42:10] <Cork> cause getting multiple values into that mess will be a real pain
[04:42:17] <Cork> getting it to work with the string
[04:42:31] <Cork> i gave you a solution yesterday
[04:42:35] <Cork> just use that
[04:42:46] <Cork> (serializeArray)
[04:47:11] <StyXman> I think I found it thead and tbody
[04:49:56] <km4> Cork: sorry for my language ;/ look http://jsfiddle.net/zckyw3qL/2/ I try change the href on image when I have active small image. Pls hover first small icon and try to click secound big icon. I use http://www.starplugins.com/cloudzoom buy the cloudzoom change only src my image and I cant klick the changes image and diplay on new window.
[04:50:56] <Cork> km4: so you mean you want to match the same a tag with the same offset small image?
[04:52:46] <km4> Cork: try to get scr small icons and paste the address into a big
[04:52:55] <Cork> uh
[04:53:01] <km4> the big image src was changes for cloudzoom
[04:53:05] <Cork> your changing the link not the image
[04:53:50] <Cork> km4: is this what you're after? http://jsfiddle.net/zckyw3qL/3/
[04:59:07] <km4> Cork: in half ;) testing
[05:32:11] <sharpy35> hey guys. i am currently trying to resize an iframe using jquery. the iframe has a dynamic content from the same domain. so lets say i am on page1 and its height is 900px then i want the iframe tobe 900px height too. if the height is 700px i want the iframe to be 700px height. is this possible?
[05:33:06] <Woet> yes that is possible
[05:35:33] <sharpy35> how?
[05:57:10] <Kartagis> sharpy35: .css()
[05:57:35] <CMFDesign> guys, my site is having some serious problems: http://www.dglcreative.com
[05:57:46] <CMFDesign> There is 48 jQuery errors on the console that mean nothing to me.
[05:57:54] <CMFDesign> and the content of the site just isn't loading. Its timing out, all sorts. Any ideas?
[06:15:45] <Kartagis> CMFDesign: first off, there is no jquery src'd
[06:16:23] <Kartagis> hrm
[06:16:39] <Kartagis> it's src'd, but not reading properly
[06:22:00] <CMFDesign> Kartagis: Ok, so what does that mean?
[06:22:25] <CMFDesign> Kartagis: You've lost me a little bit
[06:22:41] <Kartagis> CMFDesign: it can't interpret jquery,
[06:23:28] <CMFDesign> Kartagis: So, how would I resolve this? Sorry I am a total amateur at jquery related things. Dumb it right down, like you're explaining to a 5 year old.
[06:23:35] <Kartagis> /*f5e82be70cda03ad373c8871f6ce2a78*/
[06:23:46] <Kartagis> do you know what this is?
[06:24:10] <CMFDesign> doesn't ring any bells. Could be a google anaylitics page?
[06:24:11] <Kartagis> it's at the beginning of jquery.min.js
[06:24:24] <CMFDesign> I don't know what it is then
[06:24:29] <Kartagis> no, this is not a ga code at all
[06:24:35] <Kartagis> try removing it
[06:24:56] <CMFDesign> ok remove and reupload jquery.min.js right?
[06:25:13] <Kartagis> wp-content/themes/CherryFramework/js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js
[06:25:19] <Kartagis> that's right
[06:25:43] <Kartagis> you may want to make a backup first
[06:25:55] <CMFDesign> Have a backup, the site is fucked anyway lol
[06:26:32] <Kartagis> I'm almost 90% sure this is what's causing it
[06:27:05] <CMFDesign> Is that what is causing the site to not display correctly etc also?
[06:27:09] <CMFDesign> And what could it be?
[06:27:46] <Kartagis> that code I told you to remove
[06:27:55] <Kartagis> oh
[06:28:06] <Kartagis> I've got absolutely no idea
[06:28:31] <Kartagis> looks like some kind of hash
[06:31:05] <CMFDesign> Removed but hasn't changed anything.
[06:32:03] <CMFDesign> It seems that it might be in all my js files.
[06:34:43] <CMFDesign> plus all pages are displaying correctly apart from teh home page
[06:39:47] <Kartagis> CMFDesign: get a fresh copy of jquery-1.7.2
[06:40:05] <CMFDesign> I think the site has been hacked somewhere
[06:58:13] <wfq> hi all
[06:59:10] <wfq> I am using jquery validation plugin and would like to force the form to be reevaluated as I wipe out some fields as part of the user interaction witht he form
[06:59:35] <wfq> Basically I am looking for something such doOperation();$(form).invalid();
[07:05:37] <wfq> can't find proper documentation about it
[07:13:57] <asd> hi
[07:16:22] <asd> I want to post json data to a http url (a webservice built by lotus domino) but in firefox i get CORS/cross-origin request error. In my .htaccess i allowed all headers origin * and also allowed POST and GET, I also tried to put this on the lotus domino webservices but if i curl response headers to the webservice i won't get headers back.. My question: is it also possible to set custom headers on the webservice by script outside the webs
[07:25:28] <wfq> asd, what?
[07:28:11] <Cork> asd: the request the browser sends to the server have to respond with the header
[07:28:37] <Cork> asd: you might also need OPTIONS support as that is what the browsers request if you do a post
[07:29:07] <Cork> asd: about how to get this done, is offtopic for this channel, try find something for the server language the webservice is written in
[07:29:40] <Cork> (something that most likely will be a bit hard as it is lotus)
[10:06:30] <absklb> hi
[10:06:45] <absklb> i have <a class="pull-right bordered" aria-describedby="msf0-next-desc ui-tooltip-1" data-html-tooltip-title="<i class='icon-document'></i> Chapter 4" role="button" href="http://localhost:3000/courses/5/modules/items/10"> how can i print the href part in jq?
[10:10:08] <dumptruckman> How would I go about showing what is effectively a whole separate page of content as a frame on a page when the window is over a certain size but require a navigation button when smaller?
[10:10:34] <dumptruckman> "frame"
[10:12:20] <taplar> absklb: you can get href with either attr('href') or prop('href')
[10:14:07] <absklb> ok.
[10:14:35] <absklb> taplar: i am doing console.log($('.pull-right bordered').attr('href');); and it prints null
[10:15:02] <taplar> '.pull-right.bordered'
[10:15:10] <taplar> those classes are on the same object
[10:15:13] <taplar> so no space
[10:15:30] <absklb> ok
[10:16:22] <taplar> also remove the ; after that attr()
[10:17:09] <absklb> ok
[10:18:16] <hellyeah> let me ask this. There is statuscode: property in ajax what html code should i include in statuscode:. 404 is enough?
[10:19:57] <taplar> it depends on the endpoint
[10:20:15] <taplar> you should know what status codes the endpoint should be able to return and base your decision off of that
[10:20:26] <hellyeah> can you explain what endpoint is if you dont mind?
[10:20:38] <taplar> the url
[10:20:51] <taplar> any url that an ajax requests is an 'endpoint'
[10:21:03] <anli> I want to get a list of elements on a webpage causing a horizontal scrollbar, is there such?
[10:21:06] <hellyeah> ah okey but is it possible to get all of failure code 400,500?
[10:21:17] <hellyeah> taplar: ic
[10:21:23] <taplar> what do you mean 'get all'?
[10:21:53] <hellyeah> i mean
[10:21:54] <hellyeah> i can get 404 or 501 or 504
[10:22:04] <taplar> if the endpoint can return those, sure
[10:22:12] <hellyeah> right there is lots of html status code when request is failure
[10:22:35] <hellyeah> so do i need to write circumstances for every failure html code
[10:22:39] <hellyeah> in AJAX?
[10:22:50] <taplar> fail() is every failure
[10:23:05] <hellyeah> ic someone wrote statuscode: 404 ...
[10:23:08] <hellyeah> in AJAX
[10:23:23] <taplar> the only reason you do that is if you have different logic to perform based on the different error codes
[10:23:36] <hellyeah> well do i need that?
[10:23:41] <taplar> do you?
[10:23:45] <hellyeah> or fallback function can cover all
[10:23:58] <hellyeah> taplar: i am newbie so i dont know just wondering
[10:24:05] <taplar> there isn't a blanket statement in this situation.  it depends on your app
[10:24:13] <hellyeah> ic
[10:24:28] <hellyeah> well i dont have good relation with "depends" xD
[10:24:48] <taplar> if you don't have a reason to, then dont, :)
[10:24:58] <taplar> work on fufilling your business requirements
[10:24:58] <hellyeah> taplar: so i need to know what possible status code i can get in my app is that what you said
[10:25:31] <hellyeah> now in my code just have success and error
[10:25:44] <hellyeah> i suppose if page request fail the error function will be triggered
[10:25:47] <hellyeah> is that right?
[10:25:54] <taplar> fail/error yeah
[10:26:50] <hellyeah> i guess it is what you meant with fail right qXHR.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[10:27:00] <taplar> yeah
[10:27:45] <hellyeah> done,fail,always
[10:28:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:28:19] <hellyeah> when it fails i can insert a message to a div
[10:28:27] <hellyeah> and send an email to someone from backend
[10:28:35] <hellyeah> for warning about server failure
[10:28:40] <hellyeah> does it sound good idea?
[10:28:44] <dumptruckman> hmm
[10:29:06] <hellyeah> my backend function constantly check if a div is empty or not
[10:29:20] <dumptruckman> so could i just put all the content in the same section of the page for a small screen and just have a button flip the visibility of each content box?
[10:29:22] <hellyeah> if it doesnt empty my method send a mail to someone
[10:30:12] <p2sk> hellyeah: bear in mind, if your are not the only human using your app, you should provide appropriate feedback to your users
[10:30:32] <hellyeah> p2sk: ye this is my aim about that
[10:30:49] <hellyeah> because when it fails i will need well design alarm mechanism
[10:31:22] <hellyeah> p2sk: do you like the idea?
[10:31:45] <p2sk> from a UX perspective its a must
[10:32:07] <hellyeah> what is UX perspective?
[10:32:18] <hellyeah> let me google
[10:32:22] <p2sk> user experience
[10:32:29] <hellyeah> ic
[10:32:31] <hellyeah> thanks
[10:33:30] <hellyeah> p2sk: do i need fallback besides success and error?
[10:35:12] <p2sk> its a matter of failing. do a user must know in detail why the process failed? how can your provided error feedback help your user?
[10:36:12] <hellyeah> probably they should know what status code page return and may be short description of an error like bad gateway, connection timeout, page not found etc.
[10:36:37] <hellyeah> so my message to user may be like 404 - page not found or 504 - bad gateway
[10:36:44] <p2sk> if success and error are sufficient, than you probibly dont need a fallback
[10:37:11] <hellyeah> p2sk: kinda newbie on that bussines i am not sure when fallback is executed
[10:38:04] <hellyeah> anyway  i will learn more i am sure
[10:38:32] <hellyeah> p2sk: to give error message like 404 - page not found seems good in case of ajax request fail
[10:38:47] <anli> I was writing a little script to detect that is meant to be pasted into the console window, checking if elements are causing a horizontal scrollbar, however, it seems like I get false negatives, because I have a scrollbar and it outputs nothing: http://pastebin.com/2q2QzQQU
[10:39:09] <anli> oops, -to detect
[10:39:46] <anli> Is there something obviously wrong with it?
[10:39:52] <p2sk> hellyeah: the question is, what the ajax call does
[10:40:34] <p2sk> and the user would expect
[10:40:57] <hellyeah> ajax call the page with method  that has parameters from backend
[10:41:25] <hellyeah> theyre can be problem in backend as well as frontend
[10:41:29] <hellyeah> and ajax call can fail
[10:41:38] <hellyeah> actually there is some scenerios really
[10:44:57] <hellyeah> anyuway need to go now thanks for helping me out
[10:58:07] <Whiskey> Is there anyway you can change CSS whit jQuery in the stylesheet and not inline like css()
[10:59:18] <p2sk> why dont you change it directly in your css file in the first place
[11:00:18] <Alex_______> Hi
[11:00:19] <Whiskey> Well as it has one value that i need to change
[11:00:30] <hs___> ok
[11:00:34] <Alex_______> I need help with a ajax call
[11:00:56] <Whiskey> but css() won´t work whit hover so i need to do something else
[11:01:14] <hs___> hello, I want some help about my  jQuery source
[11:01:27] <taplar> Whiskey: you can added another class that overrides that value
[11:01:41] <Whiskey> how?
[11:02:11] <taplar> .class1 { font-size: 12px; }  .class1.class2 { font-size: 24px; }
[11:02:13] <Whiskey> you mean first use the class that has the setting, and then remove the class and use an unused class that has the new value
[11:02:28] <taplar> adding and removing class2 would change the font
[11:02:44] <Whiskey> how do you do that?
[11:02:54] <taplar> $(selector).addClass('className')
[11:03:06] <taplar> and subsequently removeClass()
[11:03:34] <Whiskey> lets see if it works
[11:08:47] <Whiskey> Hmm not work as espected, have to try a bit more thanks anyway taplar: it has to work someway
[11:18:15] <taplar> Whiskey: did it not work at all?  http://jsfiddle.net/d7qfs6gn/
[11:22:31] <Whiskey> I use it whit hover, it add the class but the hover color not work
[11:22:50] <taplar> you can also do .class1.class2:hover {}
[11:23:07] <Whiskey> taplar: example here http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/68/
[11:23:55] <taplar> which one is the issue?
[11:25:56] <Whiskey> taplar: if you click on invert
[11:26:27] <Whiskey> its the 4 last elements in CSS and look in css after function Invert() {
[11:26:34] <Whiskey> sorry, javascript for function Invert() {
[11:27:04] <Whiskey> everything is applayed fine so i don´t really see why it not work
[11:28:11] <taplar> it's getting it's bg color from .Link
[11:28:59] <taplar> you can right click on an element and inspect it and the css on the right will show you what is applied and from where
[11:29:40] <Whiskey> taplar: but it won´t matter
[11:29:47] <Whiskey> if i remove it, it won´t be gold when i hover over it
[11:29:59] <Whiskey> the bg-color don´t really matter in this case
[11:31:05] <taplar> so you on invert add another class to it that overrides the bg color
[11:31:12] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:31:16] <Whiskey> i think i do
[11:31:25] <taplar> not on that fiddle your not
[11:31:44] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/66/ <--- that one is working, But it has some css problems
[11:31:55] <Whiskey> the hover mass everything up
[11:32:20] <taplar> ah, ok
[11:32:54] <Whiskey> a:hover {color: gold !important;} <-- that one was missing
[11:34:20] <Whiskey> but don´t like to use !important but the stupid CSS() override it
[11:35:00] <taplar> i don't either.  from my experience, the more specific the selector the greater its weight
[11:36:09] <Whiskey> $("a, body, html, .infoViewLine").css("color", "black"); <-- make the a :hover not working
[11:36:28] <taplar> inline css is the most granular you can get
[11:37:12] <taplar> but all that is kinda off topic of the room
[11:37:50] <Whiskey> yeh, and its no way to append hover to inline
[11:38:23] <taplar> no, that would be more of a mouseover or mouseenter event
[11:38:45] <Whiskey> yeh so back at point one agian
[11:39:15] <taplar> nah, that's a last resort.  this is pretty much a css issue.
[11:39:46] <taplar> you might give ##css a try
[11:41:02] <Whiskey> actully why don´t use jQuery :D
[11:41:06] <Whiskey> damn this uggly :D
[11:41:22] <taplar> because the functionality can be achieved with css
[11:41:24] <Whiskey> think i got it
[11:41:28] <taplar> not everything needs to be solved with js
[11:41:42] <Whiskey> i don´t think that as the color is inline by jQuery it can´t be changed
[11:42:01] <taplar> right, so that part would change to not be inline
[11:42:06] <taplar> and use a class instead
[11:42:21] <dziegler> Hi, is there a common reason why i cant submit a form, i added using .html() function? I query the form using ajax
[11:42:32] <Whiskey> i don´t think you can use class on body html
[11:42:38] <taplar> sure you can
[11:42:58] <taplar> well, never did so on html, but body sure.
[11:42:59] <Whiskey> and even if you do it will still override the colors
[11:43:27] <taplar> not saying it's easy, :)
[11:43:58] <taplar> dziegler: got a fiddle?
[11:44:47] <Whiskey> :P
[11:47:09] <dziegler> taplar: not sure how to put this into a fiddle... So basicly i use gridstack.add_widget($.parseHTML(ajaxResponse)); If i brows to the in the browser it works, but if i try to inject it with ajax, it will not submit
[11:47:56] <taplar> how/when is it being created.  how/where are you trying to submit it.  that's what i need to see
[11:49:56] <dziegler> taplar: how can i simulate this ajax stuff using jsfiddle?
[11:50:26] <taplar> you don't necessarily need to.  i just need to see what your trying to do
[11:51:01] <kegster> how can i "hijack" anchors in the URL --- like domain.com/#jump will jump to id="jump" -- but i want to kind of take over that and control what happens rather than the browser jumping
[11:51:06] <kegster> is there a way to do that:
[11:51:26] <taplar> kegster: you can bind to the link and do your logic, after cancelling the event
[11:51:53] <kegster> well if i type domain.com/#jump in my browser and not a link--- does the same method apply?
[11:51:59] <taplar> no
[11:52:04] <taplar> that's not a page operation
[11:52:16] <taplar> other than maybe unload
[11:52:28] <dziegler> taplar: i guess its not that helpfull if i past you just the HTML right?
[11:52:28] <taplar> not familiar with that
[11:52:45] <taplar> dziegler: any more information is good at this point, :P
[11:52:58] <taplar> all i'm working with right now is 'its not submitting'
[11:53:00] <taplar> heh
[11:53:37] <dziegler> taplar: so this is my form: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=RA2x6FJPxJ
[11:53:51] <Whiskey> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/69/ there you go
[11:54:04] <Whiskey> but then i use important on two places to override the inline
[11:54:32] <dziegler> taplar: line 50 - 95 just a simple html form^^
[11:55:01] <taplar> dziegler: k, now where's your script?
[11:55:33] <Whiskey> Sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/70/ found an error :D
[11:55:38] <dziegler> taplar: what i put into the JS box is basicly all i do in this case
[11:56:15] <taplar> so i'm confused
[11:56:21] <taplar> what submit is not working?
[11:57:28] <dziegler> taplar: line 97, if i inject this using the code, it acts like a <a href="javascriot:void();"></a>
[11:58:17] <taplar> uh, on it's own that line doesn't do anything
[11:58:31] <taplar> well, unless your trying to call a method called void
[11:58:48] <taplar> which.....would be weird
[11:59:12] <dziegler> taplar: no, it a standard input type submit, but if you klick on the button it will act like a void nothing happen...
[11:59:56] <taplar> ?  the submit is outside that link
[11:59:56] <b-ot> gayest thing you've ever done ajpiano
[12:00:03] <kegster> taplar, actually it was quite easy. i check for window.location.hash and if exists, i process that way. seems to hijack nicely.
[12:00:08] <kegster> checked*
[12:00:26] <taplar> ah, cool
[12:00:37] <kegster> FYI heh
[12:00:43] <kegster> it returned #the_hash
[12:00:47] <dziegler> taplar: No, there is no link..
[12:00:54] <kegster> pretty interesting default var to have :)
[12:00:55] <taplar> <a> is a link
[12:01:01] <jumanji> is there a jquery library that lets me slide up a bottom panel overlay? sort of like a console.
[12:01:33] <taplar> you have an <a> surrounding Preview which you have doing nothing
[12:01:48] <dziegler> taplar: this was just a comparison that my input type sumbit acts like an <a href="void();"> because if you click on it nothing will happen ;)
[12:02:11] <taplar> that's still janky html
[12:03:02] <taplar> so anyway you say you click the submit and it does nothing
[12:03:36] <dziegler> taplar: thats right, the preview button is handled by jquery and is working well^^ but submit is dead :(
[12:04:05] <taplar> are you doing any sort of event handling on the form?
[12:04:57] <taplar> cause unless your doing something to prevent it, that should submit
[12:06:36] <dziegler> taplar: no, nothing like this...
[12:07:11] <taplar> then not sure.  the submit is before the form close so it should be fine
[12:10:00] <dziegler> taplar: yes - i guess this gridstack.add_widget($(widgetHtml)); that inserts the HTML is the problem... will see how i can workaround this, thanks for your time
[12:10:12] <taplar> np, gl
[12:15:21] <Es0teric> how do i overwrite width and height in img tags?
[12:16:28] <taplar> you can use css() or width() and height()
[14:42:25] <printForever> hi guys]
[14:42:34] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/BU9yf38J
[14:42:49] <printForever> I'm trying to get an element on my page, that is WIDER than 768px
[14:43:04] <printForever> problem is, the console output says ALL of them are wider
[14:43:20] <printForever> but they are not! the layout window shows them exactly 768px
[14:45:16] <printForever> can anyone take a look, please?
[15:15:34] <NoiseEee> printForever: debug
[15:15:45] <NoiseEee> whatever "the layout window" is is wrong
[15:15:55] <printForever> ?
[15:16:14] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/Lut3yo9a/
[15:16:33] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/Lut3yo9a/1/
[15:20:06] <printForever> nope
[15:20:13] <printForever> still posts a lot of them
[15:20:31] <printForever> oh, I get it...
[15:20:38] <printForever> he goest through each element
[15:20:44] <printForever> thre is a lot less than before
[15:21:19] <printForever> it returns an object
[15:23:03] <NoiseEee> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/Lut3yo9a/2/ shows you that only the DIV and ASIDE were found to be larger than 768; the ARTICLE that was 768 did not get flagged
[15:23:13] <NoiseEee> printForever: so jquery is fine, somewhere your code is incorrect
[15:55:26] <PhilFromHeck> Anyone familiar with less? It appears that the in-browser compiler might have an issue with variables. It's throwing an error on http://jsfiddle.net/859mh9ga/ saying that the variable isn't defined.
[15:55:42] <PhilFromHeck> message: "variable @lightGreen is undefined"
[15:55:46] <PhilFromHeck> driving me  insane.
[15:56:18] <PhilFromHeck> assume thats imported right before the less.js
[16:04:36] <pokergod> how best should you handle when a table does not have a tr row in it? http://jsfiddle.net/nut2exuv/
[16:14:58] <shoky_> pokergod: what do you mean?
[16:15:19] <pokergod> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/nut2exuv/2/
[16:15:31] <pokergod> when there is no row found, I want to default to a row format.
[16:16:30] <pokergod> may I query you shoky>
[16:16:30] <shoky> and what's the problem?
[16:16:34] <shoky> why?
[16:18:20] <pokergod> When the table has <tr><td class=".."></td></tr>, my stuff works.   When there is no row found, and I do that clone method that ngharo gave me, it messes up.  I want to say.. if no row found when cloning, use this $("<tr><td class='one'....")
[16:19:17] <shoky> if ($last.length === 0) { $last = $("<tr>..."); }    ?
[16:20:32] <km4> ;/
[16:21:07] <shoky> pokergod:  your thead is messed up btw, you should have a <tr> around the <th>..</th>
[16:53:55] <LindsayMac> ?
[16:54:11] <LindsayMac> weird
[16:59:24] <LindsayMac> anyone still left after netsplit?
[16:59:44] <duch_kazatel> weird, i didn't see a netsplit.
[17:00:19] <AnotherNick> really??
[17:00:41] <AnotherNick> http://cl.ly/image/1i1e1x0k443B
[17:01:03] <duch_kazatel> my client explicitly says if it was a netsplit or not.
[17:01:24] <duch_kazatel> and all that happened over a pretty long period of time.
[17:03:05] <AnotherNick> oh huh... I saw a huge chunk happen in another room all at once and assumed people across the same net
[17:23:27] <LindsayMac> Backbone.js frustrates the heck out of me
[17:23:41] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[17:24:38] <jfive> whello
[17:24:39] <jfive> -w
[17:25:34] <LindsayMac> So again.. working inside of WordPress and they use backbone.js to powere their media modal window. They have an event that triggers their save function every time you blur an input field but I have a grouped input field that I don't want to save until I blur the second one. The hiccup is I can't alter core
[17:26:12] <duch_kazatel> bind an event handler to the first and stopPropagation() on that one.
[17:26:18] <duch_kazatel> that might work.
[17:26:35] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you're SOL without rewriting it.
[17:26:39] <jfive> does anyone know if there's any way in jquery to do like an on('change') for a checkbox, when that checkbox is not being directly clicked?
[17:27:05] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  just something like .on( 'blur', '#firstname' function(e){ stopPropagation(); });?
[17:27:12] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac basically yeah.
[17:27:20] <duch_kazatel> e.stopPropagation();
[17:27:26] <duch_kazatel> jfive how are you changing that checkbox?
[17:27:41] <jfive> duch_kazatel: remember i was asking about styling checkboxes yesterday? :)
[17:27:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:27:55] <jfive> oh sorry, maybe it wasn't you, thought it was haha
[17:27:59] <duch_kazatel> it may have been.
[17:28:15] <duch_kazatel> i hardly remember what i ate for breakfast, and i eat the same thing every day ;)
[17:28:16] <jfive> well anyhow, i created my own checkboxes and when the user clicks those it changes the value of the real checkbox
[17:28:22] <duch_kazatel> show us what you did.
[17:29:39] <GJdan> Is there a way to make it so you can't interact with a flowing element, but instead can interact with whatever is behind it?
[17:30:00] <GJdan> floating element*
[17:31:37] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events GJdan
[17:31:53] <duch_kazatel> not much browser support fwiw.
[17:32:24] <GJdan> ah, thanks
[17:32:33] <duch_kazatel> IE11 and above.
[17:38:15] <jfive> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/579zuzc7/1/
[17:38:46] <duch_kazatel> $('#question1').on('change', document, function() {
[17:38:47] <duch_kazatel> (wat)
[17:39:06] <jfive> duch_kazatel: i am trying to change the value of the #ratings hidden input when the checkbox is checked (or set it to nothing when the checkbox is unchecked)
[17:39:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid event binding fwiw.
[17:39:32] <jfive> yeah i was trying to bind it to the document, got the wrong syntax
[17:39:37] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('change', '#question1', function() {
[17:39:46] <jfive> that's what i was thinking of, yeah
[17:40:03] <duch_kazatel> try using .prop('checked', true)
[17:42:00] <jfive> duch_kazatel: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/579zuzc7/3/
[17:45:50] <jfive> it seems from my testing that the .on('change') only fires when i click the real checkbox
[17:46:11] <jfive> even if i bind it to the document scope
[17:47:23] <Tagor> is there a shorter version of $('.menu').find('li') ?
[17:47:57] <jfive> tagor: is the li element a direct descendant of .menu?
[17:48:09] <Tagor> jfive: yes
[17:48:14] <Tagor> .menu = ul
[17:48:23] <jfive> tagor: $('.menu > li')
[17:49:13] <Tagor> jfive: thanks
[17:49:22] <jfive> tagor: np
[17:50:34] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i THINK that it is working.. phew
[17:53:50] <LindsayMac> arg.. almost
[17:54:55] <LindsayMac> nope
[17:55:41] <duch_kazatel> woops, got pulled aside.
[17:56:19] <duch_kazatel> jfive you'll have to manually fire the change event iirc.
[17:58:29] <LindsayMac> Ahh wait... 		change: 'change' so its not blur... hmmm.
[18:09:44] <LindsayMac> hmm there seems to be a "dispose" function.. i think that would work
[18:11:35] <LindsayMac> if I can trigger the "dispose" i think that would work...
[18:12:11] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:13:28] <LindsayMac> am i crazy? lol
[18:13:35] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're talking about.
[18:13:41] <duch_kazatel> haven't been payign attentioon.
[18:13:53] <LindsayMac> Im sorry.. sometimes I type out my ideas just to put them out into the ether. You dont have to be
[18:14:03] <duch_kazatel> heh, that's a little spammy ;)
[18:14:37] <LindsayMac> is it? Sometimes I type it out, if someone is following along and wants to chime in i will chat it through but I dont expect you to be hanging on my every word
[18:15:13] <duch_kazatel> you're not really asking a question about jquery, yknow? like, you're just sort of talking to yourself.  not a big deal i guess, just kind of weird.
[18:15:49] <LindsayMac> Yea i guess you're right.. its not the right room for it.
[18:16:32] <LindsayMac> heh.. either way.. my idea didnt work lol
[18:20:13] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  OMG i got it!
[18:20:14] <LindsayMac> woop
[18:20:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: thanks for dealing with my crazy ;)
[18:26:23] <ul71m0> LindsayMac: is wp expert :)
[18:30:56] <pokergod> I want to find the th, and then replace those to td's.
[18:35:33] <pokergod> can anyone think of how to do that?

[18:46:59] <Duvdevan> >> hi;
[18:47:02] <Duvdevan> > hi;
[18:47:06] <Duvdevan> oh no bot
[18:56:20] <badcss> Hi everyone, I'm working on a WordPress based website and trying to detect which post category is checked. The problem is the 'checked' attribute doesn't seem to get changed when you click on a checkbox.
[18:56:45] <snover> get the property `checked` not the attribute.
[18:57:00] <Duvdevan> badcss have some code?
[18:57:02] <badcss> It does, however, add a :before psuedoselector
[18:57:50] <badcss> http://pastebin.com/QWGaSh4U
[18:58:38] <Duvdevan> try
[18:59:05] <Duvdevan>  input[value*="Stone Slabs"]
[18:59:13] <Duvdevan> also on the option fields
[18:59:26] <Duvdevan> oh sorry
[18:59:31] <Duvdevan>  input[value~="Stone Slabs"]
[18:59:35] <Duvdevan> that's the right one
[19:00:31] <badcss> I think the problem is the checked="checked" doenst change in the html when you click the option
[19:00:38] <badcss> it adds a :before with some css
[19:00:47] <badcss> input[type=checkbox]:checked:before {
[19:00:47] <badcss>     content: '\f147';
[19:00:47] <badcss>     margin: -3px 0 0 -4px;
[19:00:47] <badcss>     color: #1e8cbe;
[19:00:47] <badcss> }
[19:00:59] <badcss> thats the only thing that changes on click
[19:01:51] <snover> you can’t use pseudo-elements with replaced content
[19:01:59] <snover> e.g. form elements, images
[19:02:13] <Duvdevan> snover (Thumbs Up)
[19:02:48] <badcss> snover what do you mean
[19:03:09] <Duvdevan> :checked
[19:03:11] <Duvdevan> :before
[19:03:12] <Duvdevan> :stuff
[19:03:17] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element
[19:03:39] <snover> you cannot use pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after with replaced content
[19:06:18] <devslash> is it valid to have a hyperlink that calls a jQuery ajax request like this: <A HREF="javascript:;" onclick="jQuery.ajax({ type:'POST',url:'myphppage.php',data:{serverName:'FUBAR'}, success: function(){ alert('done!');} });">Report a problem</A>
[19:06:35] <Duvdevan> my god
[19:06:39] <taplar> it's better to bind in a script rather than inline
[19:06:44] <taplar> separate your markup and your logic
[19:06:53] <Duvdevan> that's like Klingon
[19:06:59] <Duvdevan> or chinese
[19:07:56] <pokergod> if have 2 classes returned, how do i select the leftmost one?
[19:08:06] <taplar> you don't, order is not guarenteed
[19:08:31] <Duvdevan> $('.yourClassName');
[19:08:31] <taplar> well, what do you mean 'returned'?
[19:08:39] <Duvdevan> $('.yourClassName.yourSecondClassName');
[19:08:42] <Duvdevan> if you have something like
[19:08:52] <Duvdevan> <a class="yourClassName yourSecondClassName">
[19:09:03] <pokergod> $tr.attr('class') returns .. "blah center".  I only want blah
[19:09:08] <taplar> oh
[19:09:19] <taplar> split it on space and get element [0]
[19:09:52] <badcss> snover I just read that but I still don't really understand it
[19:10:18] <snover> <input> elements are not real elements in CSS. you cannot do normal CSS things to them.
[19:10:26] <snover> like ::before.
[19:10:28] <snover> you cannot do that.
[19:10:36] <taplar> what do you mean not real?
[19:10:44] <taplar> you can set font size, background color, text color...
[19:10:58] <taplar> border
[19:10:59] <snover> literally the first line of the article
[19:11:04] <badcss> i was just playing with it and it looks like the :before element on the input is to style the checkmark on the input checkbox
[19:11:09] <snover> “In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS.”
[19:11:58] <badcss> but i still dont see the checked="checked" change when i uncheck it, the only thing that is different is the :before psuedo selector gets added to add the stylized checkbox
[19:12:17] <taplar> the dom changes, not the html
[19:12:33] <badcss> ah
[19:12:34] <Duvdevan> make your own checkbox
[19:12:35] <snover> taplar: that you can style form elements is an implementation-defined capability
[19:13:00] <taplar> uh
[19:13:03] <taplar> what isn't?
[19:13:08] <taplar> lol
[19:13:24] <badcss> snover taplar so looking at my js, i've tried .is(':checked') and .prop('checked') but neither work
[19:13:25] <pokergod> see anything wrong with :  $v = $(this).prop('class').split(' ')[0];
[19:13:25] <snover> taplar: everything else, which is explicitly defined in the css specification.
[19:13:30] <badcss> I cant even get my test alert box to work
[19:13:53] <taplar> pokergod, looks fine
[19:14:12] <taplar> snover, ah ok, if that's your reason i guess I can see your point
[19:14:39] <taplar> but really, if it works, what does it matter if its 'real' or not
[19:15:17] <taplar> badcss, got a fiddle?
[19:16:10] <badcss> taplar no ill create one now
[19:17:42] <badcss> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/2/
[19:17:47] <badcss> taplar
[19:19:15] <taplar> your selector is returning 0
[19:19:22] <taplar> it's not matching anything
[19:19:28] <badcss> https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/3/
[19:20:14] <badcss> oh
[19:20:15] <badcss> damn
[19:20:51] <taplar> also it's been said before that the sizzle engine can be slow at times, so selectors on attributes might should be avoided
[19:21:54] <badcss> https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/5/  - this is my latest with better defined selectors but still not working
[19:22:29] <badcss> taplar i dont know what the sizzle engine is. whats the proper way to do it?
[19:22:35] <taplar> can i ask why your doing a delegate binding on an input box?
[19:22:50] <badcss> basically i am trying to do something i thought would be simple
[19:22:57] <taplar> the sizzle engine is what jquery uses to do it's selector lookups
[19:23:02] <badcss> on check of a checkbox, hide some options from the dropdown menu
[19:23:23] <taplar> right, but it's a delegate your using.  checkboxes really don't have children inputs
[19:23:24] <badcss> there are 2 products, stone slabs and tiles
[19:23:38] <badcss> idk what a delegate means sorry
[19:23:49] <taplar> $(selector).on(event, childSelector, handler)
[19:23:53] <taplar> that's a delegate binding
[19:24:01] <badcss> oh I see
[19:24:05] <devslash> ok so i cleaned up my code and this is what it looks like: http://pastebin.com/bFWQsHER
[19:24:15] <taplar> it lets the event bubble up to the selector, which then sees if the event happened on a childSelector, and if so applies the handler to it
[19:24:19] <badcss> I was following this stackoverflow contribution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23177617/how-to-do-jquery-function-if-wordpress-metabox-checkbox-is-checked-sync-in-add-n
[19:24:42] <devslash> I'm tracing the execution. when you click on a hyperlink it calls this function but when I step through it, neither success or error are ever called
[19:25:04] <taplar> with delegate bindings, you want to bind on a parent that will always be there, so that the children can come and go, and it will still work
[19:25:17] <devslash> I do see the alert before and after tyhe ajakx request
[19:25:41] <badcss> can i just eliminate the delegate binding? ive always just done selector, on change function
[19:25:54] <taplar> if you want to sure
[19:25:55] <badcss> the only reason i added the delegate part was because of that post on stackoverflow
[19:25:57] <devslash> does anyone know why this ajax request isnt working
[19:26:09] <Duvdevan> let us = see;
[19:26:09] <badcss> ok i just eliminated it but it still doesnt seem to be working :(
[19:26:26] <taplar> hold on, what's your latest revision
[19:26:54] <badcss> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/6/
[19:29:44] <taplar> so i'm assuming that you want that to work when the checkbox next to the Stone Slab is checked?
[19:30:00] <devslash> can someone tell me why my ajax request isnt working ? http://pastebin.com/bFWQsHER
[19:32:33] <taplar> yay/nay?
[19:33:09] <taplar> watch me nay nay?
[19:33:46] <badcss> yes taplar sorry
[19:33:52] <taplar> k
[19:34:11] <badcss> i just realized i forgot the # for the selector on line 3 but that didnt fix it
[19:36:53] <badcss> :(
[19:39:36] <devslash> does anyone here use ajax
[19:40:08] <duch_kazatel> devslash lots of people do.
[19:40:11] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[19:40:23] <devslash> ok. Im having an issue where my yajax request isnt working
[19:40:31] <devslash>  http://pastebin.com/bFWQsHER
[19:40:45] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[19:40:57] <devslash> its returning an error
[19:41:02] <duch_kazatel> what's the error?
[19:41:07] <devslash> the error function is getting called
[19:41:09] <devslash> undefined
[19:41:29] <duch_kazatel> async: false - don't use this.
[19:41:38] <taplar> badcss, https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/9/ <-- got the selectors working, but got an issue with it saying it's always checked
[19:41:41] <duch_kazatel> and use console.log() instead of alerts.
[19:42:04] <devslash> removed it
[19:42:21] <taplar> ah duch_kazatel appears.  i thought maybe you took a vaca day
[19:42:24] <devslash> its alerting the message udefined not found
[19:42:34] <duch_kazatel> devslash have you checked your network tab and made sure that's working fine?
[19:42:37] <duch_kazatel> taplar sort of.
[19:43:16] <devslash> theres no errors in the network tab
[19:43:27] <duch_kazatel> but you're getting an alert of some kind?
[19:43:36] <duch_kazatel> that isn't just alert('something has gone wrong!'); ?
[19:43:43] <duch_kazatel> have any screenshots or anything?
[19:43:50] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/FZHCeNi6
[19:43:55] <devslash> I updated the error
[19:44:02] <devslash> opos ignore async i already removed it
[19:44:17] <duch_kazatel> what's the response from the server?]
[19:44:34] <devslash> undefined Error Not Found
[19:44:56] <duch_kazatel> so wait - when you go to the network tab and select that request, that's what's in the response field?
[19:45:04] <devslash> is it telling me it cant find the ajax script
[19:45:10] <duch_kazatel> wat
[19:45:30] <duch_kazatel> something here isn't adding up.  your ajax is obviously running.  sounds like you're having an issue with your php
[19:45:45] <devslash> I think i know what it is
[19:47:31] <taplar> badcss, ah, i had it on the wrong checkbox https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/12/
[19:48:16] <badcss> Thank you taplar
[19:51:25] <taplar> badcss, it would probably be better to to do your binding on that checkbox.  it's kinda strange to check that checkbox every time an input changes
[19:51:35] <taplar> only really relevant if that checkbox changes state
[19:52:18] <badcss> taplar so the next question is
[19:52:30] <badcss> A tile attribute is the first thing on the list
[19:52:42] <badcss> it successfully hides all the attributes in the select box with tile in them
[19:53:06] <badcss> except for the first select option which has the word tile
[19:53:12] <badcss> until you click the dropdown and see its not there
[19:54:02] <badcss> if I use remove it works but the problem is then there is no using .show()
[19:54:06] <badcss> when it becomes unchecked
[19:54:33] <taplar> so your saying if it's selected and you hide it, it doesn't unselect it?
[19:55:35] <badcss> yeah the initial one that is in the select box when the page is first loaded is a tile option
[19:57:16] <taplar> not sure about the tile option thing.  but when you hide it you could check to see if the value of the select is that option and if it is change it to the 0 index or something
[19:59:33] <taplar> btw this version has more selectors cached: https://jsfiddle.net/a4bhv1up/13/
[20:00:43] <badcss> how can I make the first Stone option be selected? $('select.attribute_taxonomy option:contains("Stone"):eq(0)').attr('selected','selected'); ?
[20:00:43] <badcss> woot woot that worked
[20:00:43] <badcss> dont know if it's the proper way to do it but it works lol
[20:00:44] <badcss> shoot, wait, nevermind that doesnt work lol
[20:00:45] <badcss> i forgot to replace the .remove() with .hide()
[20:01:20] <taplar> selectors that you do a lot, cache them
[20:02:30] <badcss> taplar that doesnt seem to be working
[20:02:49] <taplar> hmm, did i break the taxonomy part?
[20:03:25] <taplar> i didn't see the select in the fiddle so I wasn't sure
[20:04:07] <badcss> taplar http://imgur.com/n26uLmA
[20:04:36] <taplar> hah, no no, i was meaning see it in the fiddle so i could test the refactor
[20:05:17] <taplar> ah, i do if i take of the wp_hidden_child tag
[20:05:35] <badcss> wp_hidden_child???
[20:06:00] <taplar> sorry, 'wp-hidden-child'
[20:07:30] <taplar> unless that is the wrong one.  i dont see one of the lookup classes
[20:07:32] <taplar> *shrug*
[20:08:14] <badcss> hmmmm
[20:08:20] <Phoenixz> Anybody with experience using jquery and validate.js? For some reason, when loading a jquery file, validate.js won't submit at all anymore..
[20:08:47] <duch_kazatel> Phoenixz any console errors?
[20:10:19] <Phoenixz> duch_kazatel: Nope, though when using 1.8.3 I would get some weird error, and then after clicking submit again, it would submit.. But any other version, and I get nothing in console and submit click does nothing visually.. On the background, we use remote checks, like to see if the specified username is in use and all. I see those ajax calls pass but on console nothing really
[20:10:26] <duch_kazatel> what was the error?
[20:10:43] <duch_kazatel> you're basically not giving us anything to work with.
[20:11:42] <Phoenixz> duch_kazatel: well, I have little to work with, honestly, because that is it.. I'll return the 1.8.3 version to see what specific error there is, but even so, any other jquery version shows nothing at all
[20:11:56] <duch_kazatel> can you replicate the bug in a fiddle?
[20:11:59] <duch_kazatel> can you show any code?
[20:17:18] <Phoenixz> duch_kazatel: I'll try to build a very simple use case
[20:17:46] <taplar> *thumbs*
[20:37:30] <kegster> Is there anything tricky needed for iphone jquery on click events? I have 4 icons that on click, initiate a couple of simple animations. works perfect but on an iphone it's almost like i have to double tap/click
[20:42:47] <taplar> click seems like a strange event for a touch device.  though i'm a barbarian when it comes to those
[20:44:54] <taplar> kegster, you said double tap/click.  are you actually binding to both click and tap?
[20:45:14] <kegster> hmmm no
[20:45:27] <taplar> you may want to do so: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.1.1/docs/api/events.html
[20:45:28] <Horacsio> I have a button that has jquery that I want to overload and re-write with my own. is this possible?
[20:45:54] <taplar> Horacsio, what do you mean the button has jquery
[20:46:51] <Horacsio> taplar: it’s a woocommerce button with jquery to toggle a div. I don’t to use the default toggle. I want to apply my own jquery.
[20:47:59] <taplar> uh, well, you can always overwrite a $.function or $.fn.function though that is kind of strange
[20:48:31] <Horacsio> isnt’ there somekind o like !important for CSS? :D
[20:48:39] <taplar> no
[20:48:54] <taplar> what are you trying to accomplish?
[21:01:26] <Phoenixz> Anybody with experience using jquery and validate.js? For some reason, when I have a jquery library loaded next to validatejs, I need to click the submit button twice... https://jsfiddle.net/rdj0tz9f/1/ contains
[21:01:39] <Phoenixz> taplar: Here is the jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/rdj0tz9f/1/
[21:06:43] <Phoenixz> It appears to work now if I try jquery < 1.7 :( no way that verify.js requires a jquery that old, or would malfunction with newer jquery verisons??
[21:07:02] <taplar> i'm still trying to find some docs for this.  not familiar with this plugin
[21:07:51] <taplar> k it's verifyjs not validatejs
[21:08:27] <Phoenixz> taplar: I used jquery.validate before, but that one has problems with async remote calls, so I switched to verifyjs
[21:08:41] <Phoenixz> taplar: yikes, ,my bad.. Mixed up the words
[21:10:44] <taplar> so it does work with < 1.7 but not 1.7?
[21:11:02] <Phoenixz> taplar: correction, no, <1.7 works not at all
[21:11:42] <taplar> what's the purpose of the timeout?
[21:12:57] <Phoenixz> taplar: Just a test case to simulate an async remote call
[21:14:23] <taplar> not sure, it looks pretty much similar to one of the their examples
[21:15:19] <taplar> they're webpage does have the reference to jquery using 1.8 though
[21:17:39] <Phoenixz> taplar: Yeah, that's what is confusing me
[21:17:48] <SkiOne_> Hi, I have what I think is a simple problem but I can't think of how to do it. I am cloning the last row of a table. The cells contain a mixture of inputs and textareas, I need to empty both, here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/1ft3kmLL/
[21:18:47] <taplar> you clear textareas with html('') i believe
[21:19:02] <SkiOne_> ah
[21:19:40] <taplar> you might try clone().find('input, textarea').val('').html('')
[21:20:01] <SkiOne_> right
[21:20:08] <SkiOne_> that is what I was looking for
[21:20:42] <SkiOne_> cool man thanks, its working now
[21:21:08] <SkiOne_> love supporting software I wrote 2 years ago
[21:21:33] <taplar> :)
[21:21:51] <SkiOne_> actually its not bad, its a codeigniter app
[21:21:59] <SkiOne_> <3 me some codeigniter
[21:23:15] <Phoenixz> taplar: What validation plugin could do async requests  without borking up?
[21:24:44] <SkiOne_> ok taplar thanks again, I can go back to watching TV now
[21:29:14] <taplar> Phoenixz, can't recommend one myself.  we always do manual validation and rely on the backend validation
[21:29:46] <Phoenixz> taplar: I do so too, but we do front-end checking to make it a bit faster
[21:29:52] <Phoenixz> for the user, that is
[21:30:06] <taplar> yeah
[21:41:38] <kegster> taplar, when i use tap, nothing happens. click works, but a double click (double tap) has to happen -- when you click on the icon, it turns gray (as one of the animations) BUT that happens on iphone first click/tap -- but the other transitions do not occur until the second tap
[21:41:38] <kegster> any ideas?
[21:41:38] <kegster> not sure if you have an iphone
[21:43:15] <kegster> ok nvm the one click turning gray is actually the hover
[21:43:20] <kegster> so it is double tap
[21:47:33] <kegster> touchstart was the winning event
[21:47:34] <kegster> lol
[21:47:42] <taplar> ah cool
[21:48:21] <taplar> sorry, can't really help much on touch events.  i've thought about trying to get into it, but i really don't have a device to play on other than a kindle
[21:49:59] <kegster> yeah it all sucks :\ never had that issue before though
[21:50:28] <kegster> it's always either firefox (or safari) on a mac or an iphone these days that have the fine tuned tweaks needs
[21:50:29] <kegster> needed*
[21:50:31] <kegster> used to be IE haha
[21:50:41] <taplar> heh
[21:51:22] <kegster> i dev on win, and literally 99-100% of all issues i "dont see" are the ones that are on firefox + mac (which i cant see for obvious reasons haha)
[21:52:01] <taplar> hopefully you have a machine in the shop for such testing/debugging?
[21:54:12] <kegster> of course
[21:54:29] <kegster> more than that actually, but it's not 100% readily available with me at all times
[21:54:38] <taplar> ah
[21:54:44] <kegster> so normally when there's an issue it's because i hadn't checked it on FF on mac haha
[21:55:00] <kegster> all my designers use mac, so they generally see it first heh
[21:55:26] <kegster> not like it happens a lot, but when it does-- and enough projects get done for it to pop up every now and then
[21:56:09] <kegster> anywho--- brain teaser crisis averted :P
[22:05:15] <taplar> going to jump out and watch a vid before crashing.  night all
[22:35:17] <pokergod> how do you guys handle $("table thead tr") to cover both when thead is present and not present
[22:41:43] <jfive> pokergod: $("table thead tr, table tr")
[22:43:51] <pokergod> ty
[22:43:55] <jfive> np
