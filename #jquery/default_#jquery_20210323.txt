[03:06:11] <jak2000> hi all
[03:06:19] <jak2000> Json question is accepted? here?
[03:06:39] <robertmaxrees> ??  what's the question?
[03:07:01] <jak2000> when i do an ajax request... get this error: Error extraeInfoyGrabaJson: parsererror SyntaxError: Unexpected token D in JSON at position 2
[03:07:22] <jak2000> .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {               alert("Error extraeInfoyGrabaJson: " + textStatus + " " + errorThrown);
[03:07:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting back from the server?
[03:08:33] <robertmaxrees> and what does the code for the ajax request look like?
[03:10:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[03:10:52] <jak2000> i try paste
[03:10:54] <jak2000> one moment
[03:14:40] <jak2000> https://bpa.st/TNNA
[03:15:06] <robertmaxrees> ok.  and the code for the ajax call?
[03:16:03] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/b3z0wu6L/
[03:16:22] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[03:16:33] <robertmaxrees> 2 major issues here.
[03:16:36] <jak2000> why?
[03:17:04] <robertmaxrees> going to guess you're not actually getting JSON back from the server.  so kill that dataType.
[03:17:14] <robertmaxrees> but also: kill the async: false
[03:17:48] <jak2000> ok done
[03:17:59] <jak2000> datatype too?
[03:18:05] <robertmaxrees> kill it
[03:18:07] <robertmaxrees> remove it.
[03:18:24] <robertmaxrees> that's the datatype you're expecting back from the server.  if you omit it, jquery will figure it out.  which you want.
[03:19:48] <jak2000> removed and now get: "parsererror SyntaxError: Unexpected token * in JSON at position 0"
[03:20:39] <robertmaxrees> go to your network tab and find the request.  paste what's in that response.
[03:24:42] <jak2000> oo i see an error
[03:24:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[03:25:33] <jak2000> the site returned me: "msg": "invalid query parameter: \"to\" (must exceed \"from\")"
[03:25:46] <robertmaxrees> then yeah.  fix your request.
[03:28:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm out - enjoy, duder.
[03:36:48] <jak2000> parsererror SyntaxError: Unexpected token D in JSON at position 2
[03:37:14] <jak2000> in response, not error..
[03:37:54] <jak2000> its a big json, {"xmsg":"","xhtmlTabla":[{"id":20.0,"deviceid":20.0,"tag":"0PF68Q","descripcion":"AR Sup Lote 18 L23","fechamax":"2021\/03\/22 11:38:08","valor":16.4}
[03:38:05] <jak2000> i see the fecha max the \/  is the problem?
[04:38:40] <dimi1947> I want to upgrade jquery to the lates version...I am reading this guide here...https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/
[04:39:10] <dimi1947> when it says to test that page..does that mean "clicking through UI"  in other words?
[04:55:22] <Cork> yes
[04:55:45] <Cork> dimi1947: you need to execute the function call that causes the warning logging
[04:56:31] <Cork> dimi1947: also note in jquery 3 isn't "newer" then 2 or 1, they are three paralell major versions
[04:56:53] <Cork> the major versions where updated in paralell, with different compatibility layers
[05:03:16] <dimi1947> IF there are warnings to be displayed in the console..they will be displayed REGARDLESS if the code runs(by clicking through)...but doing some kind of inspection for example..OR they will be displayed on clickingg througgh?
[09:56:38] <jak2020> hi all, solved my Json problem thanks to robertmaxrees and Cork
[09:56:50] <jak2020> a dude: is possible sort a json? if yes how to?
[13:46:16] <fury__> I have something like $(document.createElement('form')).attr('action', '/some/url/').attr('method', 'post'). the form has input elements in it (according to form.serialize()). form.submit() does *nothing*. why might that be?
[15:41:49] <shoky> fury__: jsfiddle it. could be a bunch of reasons
[15:42:41] <fury__> shoky: the form needed to be appended to the body first, apparently
