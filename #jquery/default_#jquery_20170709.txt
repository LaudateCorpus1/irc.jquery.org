[03:43:12] <Neo_3333> Hi comrades !
[03:43:15] <Neo_3333> I have question
[03:43:53] <Neo_3333> how insert class "two" to this <div class="one"></div> using javascript ?
[03:43:59] <Neo_3333> without jQuery
[03:44:20] <Neo_3333> I tried this getElementByClassName('one')
[03:44:48] <Neo_3333> and than in loop do elements[i].setAttribute('class' 'two');
[03:45:12] <Neo_3333> and I got <div class="two"> but I need <div class="one two">
[03:45:18] <Neo_3333> How do it ?
[03:45:37] <Neo_3333> understood my question ?
[03:47:43] <Neo_3333> Thanks for all . :) I only solved it
[03:48:00] <Neo_3333> it's work elements[i].className += elements[i].className ? ' blue' : 'blue';
[03:48:12] <Neo_3333> it's working *
[03:48:22] <Neo_3333> easy ?
[09:34:34] <madprops> does $(element).data('string', val)  where val = $(element).val()   does anything to the variable val ?
[09:34:44] <madprops> it seems that if i add these lines https://pastebin.com/ky8rJS1Q the program becomes corrupted
[09:52:33] <madprops> nvm

[15:12:19] <SniffmeisteR> Hello. Ive been searching for a Drag and Drop (ASP !<--) code for my website. And its really hard to find, most are done with PHP on server-side and I sadly dont know it. Can someone please help me? :)
[16:36:27] <Al_nz1> I assume there is way to add a map a persons details so that they become a option in the dropdown on a text input as suggestion options?
[17:37:02] <engaged> Man I cannot figure this out…. I have a datarange jquery thing and on date change it runs a function cb(start,end) with start and end time… i have another function that gets ajax data based on start and end… like $(“#myID”).function({ ajax: {url: ‘x.php’,data: {“start”: start,”end”: end}} });   in cb() i want to do $(“#myID).ajax.reload() but it’s not changing the start and end based on the new start and end selected
[17:37:02] <engaged> only the original....
[17:42:41] <engaged> here it is:
[17:42:41] <engaged> https://pastebin.com/0YYZjXDt
[17:42:53] <engaged> How come on the ajax.reload() it isn’t using the newly select start and end
[18:09:37] <pavonia> engaged: In the AJAX call you use the two variables that never change, as far as I can see
[23:07:29] <Al_nz1> what does $('.stats:last .selectpicker').not('.stats-code-picker').selectpicker(); the selectpicker() on the end do? its a method?
