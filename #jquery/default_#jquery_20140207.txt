[00:31:58] <glontu> hi
[00:32:18] <glontu> i have an event bound on mouseover that shows a select inside of a td instead of the original text
[00:32:57] <glontu> problem is that when i click on the select the mouseout event triggers and that hides my select. how can i hide the select when the mouse leaves the td but not when the mouse is on the select ?
[00:36:18] <chamindu> hi guys
[00:36:26] <chamindu> anybody on
[00:38:42] <chamindu> hi
[00:55:41] <sess> is there any special reason for jquery ui's font-size: 1.1em on _everything_?
[01:04:34] <lo_o|> probly for smoothing
[01:07:57] <fabioportieri> it's called font normalization i guess
[01:16:13] <pom_life> Why does this not stop running when it hits 540? --->http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/sH6J8/
[01:17:01] <Cork> js> print("540" === 540)
[01:17:06] <b-ot> Cork: false
[01:17:07] <Cork> js> print("540" == 540)
[01:17:11] <b-ot> Cork: true
[01:17:16] <Cork> that is why
[01:17:36] <pom_life> so value is a string?
[01:17:42] <pom_life> or, .val()?
[01:17:44] <Cork> .val() always returns a string yes
[01:17:48] <pom_life> okay, good to know
[01:18:05] <Cork> well at least for elements with type="text"
[01:18:12] <pom_life> right
[01:18:43] <Cork> pom_life: also be careful with setInterval
[01:18:55] <Cork> as it doesn't take into account how long the script takes to run
[01:19:10] <Cork> so you can get congestion problems in the code
[01:19:18] <sess> fabioportieri: how is it normalization to increase everything with 10%?
[01:19:25] <sess> I'd call that the opposite of normalization
[01:19:49] <sess> why should jquery ui components have 10% larger fonts than my non jquery ui things?
[01:46:09] <Dirkos> When doing this, i get an field with a specific ID in it as value: $(root).find("input[name=\"files["+index+"]\"]").val(response.data.file.id);
[01:46:28] <Dirkos> how come that this data is not visible in the DOM? If i try to select it afterwards, jquery cant find it by its value
[01:46:59] <Cork> Dirkos: depends on the browser
[01:47:21] <Cork> if they display properties AND attributes in the dom inspector you can see it
[01:47:29] <Cork> if they just show attributes you won't have changed it
[01:48:01] <Dirkos> Cork: http://postimg.org/image/o6ww9h3gr/
[01:48:28] <Cork> Dirkos: ya, firebug only shows attributes in the dom inspector
[01:48:39] <Cork> (most inspectors do)
[01:48:39] <Dirkos> Cork: thing is that i cant target it this way? $(input[value="519"]); is empty
[01:48:51] <Dirkos> ofc with a ' :)
[01:48:54] <Cork> Dirkos: [] matches on attributes
[01:49:09] <Dirkos> how can i match on value?
[01:49:12] <Cork> you can't mach based on what a user types in a text field for example
[01:49:15] <Cork> you can't
[01:49:22] <Cork> you need to loop the fields and check
[01:49:32] <Dirkos> ok thnx didnt knew that
[01:49:39] <Dirkos> or create an attribute ofcourse
[01:49:43] <Cork> .filter(function() { return this.value == "519"; })
[01:49:43] <Dirkos> but that is less nice
[01:50:21] <sol> hhhheeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllpppppppp
[01:50:23] <sol> xd
[01:50:34] <sol> has anyone used the jquery ajax form plugin?
[01:50:46] <sol> works great in firefox, and then bombs in IE
[01:50:54] <sol> doesnt seem to submit my form data, I think serialize() is failing
[01:51:11] <sol> because I can explicitly send data: { field: $('#field').val() }
[01:51:17] <Cork> sol: serialize() works just fine in ie
[01:51:35] <Cork> so you need to give more context
[01:51:39] <sol> but if I try data: $('#myform').serialize(); it fails
[01:51:39] <Cork> ?g jsfiddle.net
[01:51:41] <b-ot> Cork: JSFiddle: Create a new fiddle → http://jsfiddle.net/
[01:51:42] <sol> hmm okay
[01:52:33] <Dirkos> Cork: thnx for the tip!
[01:53:49] <sol> Cork; http://jsfiddle.net/8T3NL
[01:54:03] <sol> pretty straightforward
[01:54:56] <Cork> ya, that should work just fine
[01:55:15] <Cork> (except you pasted the sections in the wrong area, but ya doesn't matter)
[01:55:41] <Cork> what happens in ie?
[01:55:53] <Cork> and are you sure it is this code failing?
[01:56:05] <Cork> also your form doesn't have a submit button
[01:56:12] <Cork> that isn't really supported in ie
[01:56:34] <sol> I did?!
[01:56:35] <sol> oops
[01:56:51] <sol> so if I add a submit button, serialize() will work? xD
[01:56:59] <sol> actually I'm not 100% sure its serialize thats causing the fail
[01:57:02] <Cork> serialize() should work either way
[01:57:04] <sol> thing is - this works perfectly fine in firefox
[01:57:21] <Cork> but submit on the form doesn't work in ie without it
[01:57:22] <sol> I load it up with alert()s each step of the way
[01:57:26] <Cork> and a few other things
[01:57:27] <sol> hmmm okay I'll try
[01:57:31] <sol> can I hide it?
[01:57:32] <ghostlines> morning, I'm playing with flexslider but can't seem to get the hover buttons to be displayed. any help is appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/twisss/xkVnz/4/
[01:57:34] <sol> display:none?
[01:57:37] <sol> (the submit button)
[01:57:47] <Cork> no
[01:58:01] <Cork> you can have it transparent
[01:58:05] <Cork> but it has to be there
[01:58:08] <Cork> (visibly)
[01:58:10] <sol> hmm I'll start with it visible and see if it fixes it
[01:58:42] <sol> the thing is - the server does get a post, it just gets no data from IE
[01:58:47] <sol> so hang on, trying with submit button
[01:59:03] <Cork> hmm that doesn't sound like a submit problem
[01:59:24] <sol> same problem
[01:59:26] <Cork> well i can't help without actually running the form submission and checking
[01:59:45] <sol> may I pm you/
[01:59:55] <sol> I'll explain the problem if we figure it out in channel to benefit everyone
[01:59:55] <sol> xD
[02:00:13] <Cork> i'm at work so i don't think i can take the time to dissect the site
[02:00:28] <sol> aw :/
[02:00:32] <sol> its very small
[02:00:42] <sol> there isnt much more than you're seeing at jsfiddle
[02:00:46] <sol> no headers/footers/etc
[02:00:51] <sol> no web design
[02:01:14] <sol> well, there are headers/footers, but they dont have content xD
[02:01:27] <Cork> well it includes debugging in ie
[02:01:36] <Cork> and... that takes time as there tools sucks
[02:01:43] <Cork> btw what version of ie do you have problem with?
[02:01:59] <Cork> ie11 is quite compliant now days
[02:02:57] <sol> its 8, but I'm using a version on a handheld as well, not sure what version it is, sec
[02:03:04] <sol> it fails on both, same problem
[02:03:46] <sol> hmm no menu option to show about :|
[02:03:49] <Cork> sol: try reproducing the plugin effect with out the plugin
[02:04:10] <Cork> that might give you a hint into what fails
[02:04:34] <Cork> also make sure all the selectors you use actually match the elements you want in ie
[02:04:42] <Cork> alert($(selector).length)
[02:06:31] <sol> well, if I specify data: and include each form input manually, it submits fine
[02:06:46] <sol> its just if I use data: $('#blahform').serialize() or leave data out altogether, it submits nothing
[02:06:56] <sol> and having to fill out a data: { array of shite } for every form is a pain
[02:09:01] <sol> I wonder if there's a console logging command for IE
[02:09:34] <sol> ah just need devtools open hmm k :)
[02:10:41] <sol> maybe not :|
[02:11:22] <Cork> there is
[02:11:33] <sol> serialize() works fine on IE - its okay I used alert xD - console.log didnt seem tow ork
[02:11:35] <Cork> but you need to open the devel tools
[02:11:39] <sol> I had opened them
[02:11:45] <sol> no matter
[02:12:05] <Cork> ya i usually debug with alerts in ie
[02:13:55] <sol> eh, I guess I'll just manually specify this shit
[02:14:02] <sol> and continue to hate IE
[02:14:32] <Cork> sol: well ie11 makes things better
[02:14:44] <Cork> but ya older ie's is a pain
[02:15:04] <seutje> 8 and up have decent breakpoints
[02:15:39] <sol> what a confusing problem though
[02:15:48] <sol> I know lots of IE quirks but never seen anything quite like this before
[02:16:01] <ravenzz> sol have you tried firebug lite?
[02:16:08] <lite> wat
[02:16:11] <lite> dammit
[02:16:17] <lite> stupid pings
[02:20:15] <sol> ravenzz; is it for IE?  firefox works perfectly
[02:21:30] <ravenzz> well it is a bookmarklet and totally written in js
[02:24:37] <sol> I'll have to learn how to use it I guess

[03:16:23] <abishek> could someone advice on what is wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/qNJE8/
[03:18:51] <aeroraver> well that depends on what you're trying to do and what's not working?
[03:26:55] <koneko> abishek, if you're wondering why the Ajax request doesn't work, it's because it's on a different domain, and that domain doesn't allow for cross-site HTTP requests
[03:27:39] <abishek> koneko, getJSON works but not $.get. any reason why?
[03:31:43] <koneko> Hm, now that I read into it, jQuery should try loading it as JSONP if the domain is different
[03:32:00] <koneko> But anyway, passing "jsonp" as the third argument in $.get works too
[05:08:54] <VectorX> in chrome or any other browser, is there a way to see what events/functions are attached to a element
[05:13:22] <fabioportieri> VectorX: have you tried inspecting the element with console.dir

[05:19:26] <fabioportieri> VectorX: nevermind me, it seems is not really possible http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2623118/inspect-attached-event-handlers-for-any-dom-element
[05:23:31] <clime> guys, if I bind to an event like this: $(document).on('next_page_loaded', selector, function(event, items) {}); why can't I unbind with $(document).off('next_page_loaded', selector)?
[05:24:05] <clime> only $(document).off('next_page_loaded') works but if I additionaly specify selector, it doesn't.

[05:26:18] <kev999> How to hide tooltip on a form input box when it is clicked on ..
[05:26:34] <kev999> can anybody help with this one ?
[05:27:29] <kev999> http://pastebin.com/kmzybW2h
[05:28:29] <kev999> is there anybody there .... as they say
[05:31:48] <napnap> hello all. I need help for a dom selector. i want to delete all line of a html table except the 2 first (the title line and the first real one). The line title has an id ="rightsTableTitle"" and the first real one has an id="rightsTableTR1" . If I write :   $("#rightsTable tr:not(tr[id~=rightsTableTR1])").remove();     all seems to work but the line title is removed too. but If I write   $("#rightsTable tr:not(tr[id~=rightsTable])").remove(); n
[05:31:48] <napnap> othing is removed...:-( How can I do ?
[05:32:40] <napnap> strange because ~= meens " containing" and both id contains the word "rightsTable" on their id
[05:34:23] <BinaryKitten> napnap $(selector').filter(function(idx) { if (idx > 1) { return true; } return false; }).remove() ?
[05:34:24] <kev999> napnap - what about .not(':1st','2nd') etc
[05:36:01] <BinaryKitten> actually ..
[05:36:12] <kev999> $("#rightsTable tr").not('#rightsTableTR1").remove();
[05:36:15] <BinaryKitten> napnap $(selector').filter(function(idx) { return (idx > 1); }).remove() ?
[05:36:17] <BinaryKitten> that's nicer
[05:37:49] <kev999> $("#rightsTable tr").not('#rightsTableTR1,#rightsTableTitle").remove();
[05:39:07] <kev999> anyone help with a tooltip problem I'm having ?
[05:41:48] <napnap> BinaryKitten,  kev999  nice, thanks at both of you.  Your two answer works great !
[05:45:58] <kev999> I think my issue is with delegation of the tooltip
[05:46:16] <kev999> http://pastebin.com/kmzybW2h
[05:46:23] <iSDP> hey people :)
[05:46:37] <kev999> tooltip won't close when inout box has focus
[05:48:23] <kev999> iSDP - just being sociable - or is there a question coming ....:-)
[05:48:33] <iSDP> sociable :P
[05:48:52] <kev999> hey yourself then !
[05:51:56] <kev999> How do you close a tooltip when triggered from a delegated object - eg $(document).tooltip()
[05:58:48] <kev999> any jquery ui experts online at the moment ??
[05:59:12] <kev999> I will however accept a genius :-)
[05:59:39] <seutje> $(document).tooltip('close')?
[06:00:13] <kev999> seutje - tried that, but the tooltip doesn't close
[06:00:50] <kev999> scenario - set up with: $( document ).tooltip()
[06:01:06] <kev999> hover over a form input - shows tooltip
[06:01:33] <kev999> click the input, but can't find the trigger to close the tooltip
[06:01:58] <kev999> tried your suggestion, but suspect it''s somethig to do with delegated tooltip issues ???
[06:02:14] <seutje> kev999: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8646
[06:03:51] <kev999> seutje - thanks - that looks like the bug.
[06:04:19] <kev999> seutje - do you think there is a workround with .promise or .delegate ??
[06:05:19] <bittyx> Hiya! Is $("#item").attr("data-item-id") equivalent to $("#item").data("item-id")?
[06:05:32] <seutje> bittyx: no
[06:06:29] <seutje> <div data-item-id="foo" /> $('div').data('item-id', 'bar'); $('div').attr('data-item-id'); // "foo"; $('div').data('item-id'); // "bar";
[06:06:32] <bittyx> seutje: So if I the HTML5 data attributes are added by the server, I should access them in the browser with the former, right?
[06:06:37] <kev999> data is a UI place for storing variable against a jquery object
[06:07:07] <seutje> bittyx: no, $.fn.data will grab from internal data store, but it does map over the data attributes onload
[06:07:26] <bittyx> Oh, I seem to remember reading something about HTML5 attributes being supported with .data() but I can't find it now.
[06:07:39] <seutje> for read, it works the same until you have data in the internal data storage
[06:07:49] <seutje> for write, it doesn't work the same at all
[06:08:22] <seutje> so in your case you can probably just use .data()
[06:09:23] <bittyx> seutje: Oh, so if I never attach data with .data(), I can retrieve the HTML5 data attributes with .data()? I guess I'll just be safer sticking to .attr()
[06:09:40] <bittyx> Who knows if some plugin decides to store its own data using .data()
[06:09:53] <seutje> bittyx: only if it uses the same keys
[06:10:09] <seutje> safer? perhaps, more performant? hell no
[06:10:45] <seutje> so if some plugin is storing things on that element on the same key, it's probably trying to be caught by your script
[06:11:06] <seutje> like a monkey-patch, if u will
[06:11:37] <bittyx> So .data() is much faster than .attr()?
[06:11:56] <blue_warlock> hello peeps
[06:12:05] <seutje> yeah, like I said, it tries to use its internal data storage as much as possible
[06:12:22] <seutje> so it can get away with not touching the DOM at all
[06:14:25] <seutje> bittyx: prolly a better explanation: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[06:14:49] <decx> oh so if you do data('stuf,'that') then it's bound as a prop and i can still get 'that' with data('stuf) later on
[06:14:59] <decx> without touching the dom
[06:15:00] <decx> neat
[06:15:12] <bittyx> seutje: Ahh, that's what I was looking for, can't believe I couldn't find it. I'm pretty sure I checked that page... Thanks!
[06:16:11] <seutje> decx: exactly (except for <object> <applet> and <embed> iirc)
[06:16:52] <decx> good to know, here's a demo if anyone's still puzzled http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3Dq5t/
[06:20:25] <decx> oh i wrote data- in the key because i was so used to it from attr
[06:20:26] <decx> ^^
[06:26:39] <salah> Hi. I downloaded a jquery plugin (timeago to be exact) which gives me the error jQuery is not defined. That might be true, because I use $ instead. Is there any ways to fix this?
[06:27:13] <logikos> from within a javascript file is there an easy way to get the name of the file
[06:27:48] <logikos> so regardless of what file the code may apear in, a function that would somehow return the name of the file the code is actualy in
[06:28:09] <logikos> kinda like php's __FILE__
[06:28:11] <logikos> constant
[06:28:31] <kev999> post it as a variable from the server
[06:29:01] <kev999> eg in php $mypage = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']
[06:29:05] <Velveeta> logikos: this might help you: http://ejohn.org/blog/__file__-in-javascript/ … google is your friend
[06:29:34] <Velveeta> kev999: i think he's looking for the name of the js file itself, not the php script of the page it's loaded into
[06:30:20] <Velveeta> salah: jQuery is the legitimate name of the jQuery variable, $ is a shortcut set up to access it, it sounds like you have a race condition going on, your plugin is trying to access jQuery before it's loaded
[06:30:22] <kev999> oh - in that case - you are right - use __FILE__
[06:30:52] <Velveeta> javascript doesn't have __FILE__ though
[06:30:57] <kev999> Velveeta ->salah - has quit
[06:31:01] <salah> no
[06:31:03] <Velveeta> but resig posted an article about an implementation of it
[06:31:05] <salah> I am still here :)
[06:31:25] <kev999> Velveeta - the page you directed to was in fact PHP code - right ?
[06:31:38] <Velveeta> no, javascript
[06:31:53] <salah> Velveeta: I can't get it, all other scripts has always been working and the timeago is inside a $(document).ready()
[06:32:32] <Velveeta> salah: but $(document).ready relies on $ being defined… if that file is being loaded before jquery is, that statement will fail
[06:32:41] <kev999> ignore me ..........
[06:33:13] <decx> logikos if you're not loading your scripts async then you get just get all the scripts that exists on the page at that point and use the last, as that's the one we're currently in
[06:33:28] <kev999> <salah> debug in your browser - you are in fact loading JQUERY before the plugin aren't you ??
[06:33:49] <salah> Velveeta: $ is defined. And all other jquery works before and after the timeago. The timeago plugin is the only thing complaining about jQuery. This is a simple page with jquery, timeago and a simple slider, so there should not be any conflicts?
[06:34:26] <salah> kev999: no, the jquery is loaded and everything works before and after the timeago, it's only the plugin which is complaining
[06:34:36] <Velveeta> is there a link where i can see this in action?
[06:52:38] <iSDP> how can i dynamically load data returned by a php function?
[06:52:50] <iSDP> the php function returns html
[06:52:58] <Velveeta> $.ajax
[06:53:16] <iSDP> $.get and $.post?
[06:53:47] <Velveeta> well i use $.ajax personally, instead of any of those variant functions
[06:53:54] <Velveeta> just so i can have full control over the options
[06:54:00] <user258467> Hi, I use the jquery autocomplete, my problem is where the keyword has no matches it clear the input text, how do I avoid this behavior?
[06:54:17] <iSDP> Velveeta, this is the php function, it's on the same page.
[06:54:29] <iSDP> s/on the same page/in the same file
[06:54:48] <Velveeta> isdp: but you're trying to load this content from the browser right?
[06:55:06] <iSDP> rather populating a table
[06:55:28] <Velveeta> but is this being done from the browser or from the server while the page's markup is still being assembled?
[06:56:03] <Velveeta> if it's from the browser in any fashion, the browser has no knowledge of any php functions in any files, all it knows is urls and javascript, so you'll have to make a call out to a url that routes to that php function via ajax
[06:58:18] <iSDP> Velveeta, the table is loaded by php in the first place, i want to add a form at the bottom of the table to add new things to it
[06:58:30] <iSDP> when i add new things i don't want to reload the page
[06:58:38] <iSDP> i'd rather reload the table data only
[06:59:14] <Velveeta> and when you add new things, is it posting that back to the server to store for retrieval as part of the updated table data?
[06:59:20] <Velveeta> i'm assuming yes
[07:00:16] <Velveeta> and are you saying that the function that outputs the table data is something that's called internally in your controller when the page is loaded, but is not itself available via a url?
[07:00:55] <Velveeta> so maybe function drawPage() calls this._getTableData() or something as part of that page assembly, but _getTableData has no url pointing to it?
[07:03:00] <Velveeta> bueller?
[07:06:07] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Is it possible to not say that in Ben Steins voice?
[07:06:27] <Velveeta> only if you don't say it at all :D but even so, you'll read it in his voice
[07:06:43] <BillCriswell> That's what I meant. It's so weird.
[07:06:55] <Velveeta> like when i say "good news, everyone! i've come up with a way to make you read this line inside your head, in my own voice!"
[07:07:15] <iSDP> Velveeta, i've tried to read it a few times, but i don't get what you mean :(
[07:07:33] <Velveeta> isdp: i'm assuming you have a typical mvc type of setup on the php side
[07:07:48] <iSDP> nope
[07:07:53] <iSDP> building from scratch
[07:08:52] <Velveeta> ok, well whatever file and function that page request is being routed to to return the html to the client, you're saying that it's calling another function in that file to get the table data, right?
[07:11:47] <ska-fan> I have a list of <tr> nodes (the same table and the same nesting level) and an <a> node that is in one of the cells of one of the rows. I want to find the <tr> node that contains the <a> node. How do I do that?
[07:12:51] <Velveeta> ska-fan: you could do something like this: $(this).closest('table').find('tr:has(a)')
[07:13:14] <Velveeta> if you're moving from the context of any random tr
[07:13:26] <krambiorix> hi, first of all the dialog doesn't open.... ? http://jsfiddle.net/u8zfS/1/
[07:13:27] <Velveeta> if you're just at the table level, you can just do this: $(this).find('tr:has(a)')
[07:13:51] <moijk> I'm dragging a clone using JQuery ui draggables, but they don't show. i try making a helper, but that doesn't show either. i see something is happening since the action is inside an iframe thus scrollbars appears, but can't say i understand the behavior.
[07:14:05] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you're not loading jquery ui in that page
[07:14:31] <ska-fan> the <a> node is not any <a> node but a specific one that I have in a variable
[07:14:36] <Velveeta> moijk: have a link to a jsfiddle example or a live demo?
[07:14:52] <krambiorix> Velveeta, where can i do that?
[07:15:14] <Velveeta> ska-fan: $(this).find('tr').filter(function () { return $(this).find(yourVariable).length; });
[07:15:41] <ska-fan> Velveeta: Thanks! :)
[07:15:43] <Velveeta> krambiorix: go get the url off of google's cdn or something, and paste it into the external resources section of jsfiddle
[07:15:47] <Velveeta> ska-fan: no problemo :)
[07:15:58] <moijk> Velveeta: unfortunately not, it's part 3 of a upload/thingy. so i need to remove anything dynamic to be able to replicate. maybe got to do a static test first. however, it paste whatever i want nicely. so whatever it does, it does right
[07:16:24] <BillCriswell> moijk: Make sure it's not just hidden, look for it in the element inspector when you start to drag.
[07:16:38] <Velveeta> moijk: yeah i'd start with a static test and see if you can make that work, and then figure out why it's not working in a more dynamic setup
[07:17:29] <BillCriswell> Velveeta's debuggin's methods sound the same as mine.
[07:17:41] <BillCriswell> Isolate. Party.
[07:17:45] <Velveeta> billcriswell: throw everything at the problem and see what sticks?
[07:17:52] <Velveeta> ohhhhhh
[07:17:53] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:17:54] <Velveeta> :D
[07:17:56] <wunz> i have something weird going on, could be a yahoo api thing: sometimes when my code runs: http://jsfiddle.net/2tRhg/19/ -- i would get: data.query.results.quote is null error - so i have to refresh a few times
[07:18:26] <wunz> seems like the getJson call to yahoo sometimes doesn't get any data from yahoo; how would i make it call that getjson until there are results?
[07:18:36] <krambiorix> Velveeta, hmm ok it works but i was wondering... On my computer, with that same code, the mask isn't rendered...
[07:19:37] <BillCriswell> wunz: Might have to do like $.ajaxSetup() and adjust the timeout? I'm thinking it's jsut slow?
[07:20:10] <Velveeta> wunz: you should isolate that getJSON call into its own named function, and then as the first line of its success handler, check for "if (!data || !data.query || !data.query.results) { /* call that function again and return */ } /* rest of your code */
[07:20:37] <wunz> getJson has a success handler?
[07:20:49] <wunz> BillCriswell: that could possibly be it, good suggestion
[07:20:58] <Velveeta> krambiorix: can i get an updated fiddle url?
[07:21:23] <Velveeta> i'd say if the code works there, but not on your own setup, then something else in your setup is causing it to not work
[07:21:26] <krambiorix> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/u8zfS/2/
[07:21:36] <BillCriswell> wunz: I think I'm wrong there.
[07:22:07] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you're still not loading jquery ui in that page
[07:22:26] <Velveeta> wunz: and yes, getJSON has a success callback, it's that function you pass after the url
[07:22:39] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i only see you loading the css, not the js
[07:22:41] <krambiorix> Velveeta, ow sorry, needed to copy the link from my other browser : http://jsfiddle.net/u8zfS/3/
[07:23:06] <BillCriswell> wunz: I'd check if( data.query.results ) before trying to use data.query.results.post
[07:23:14] <Velveeta> krambiorix: ok, so one change i see from the first url to this one that works, is that you changed the modal option from true to false
[07:23:23] <Velveeta> that would be why it's not using the overlay
[07:23:51] <BillCriswell> wunz: data.query I assume always returns, but it doesn't have results.
[07:23:51] <krambiorix> Velveeta, yeah, that was just to test, on local i have it set to true
[07:24:39] <wunz> ahh cool Velveeta , thx man
[07:24:40] <BillCriswell> but it doesn't ALWAYS have resultS*
[07:24:42] <wunz> thanks BillCriswell
[07:24:50] <Velveeta> wunz: no problem
[07:25:10] <Velveeta> krambiorix: are you sure you have the proper css in place for your local version?
[07:27:05] <krambiorix> Velveeta, now i see it... My page is scrolled and the overlay is shown at the top not at current position
[07:27:33] <iSDP> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/bGUXpzAJ
[07:27:37] <iSDP> that's the whole code
[07:28:44] <iSDP> sorry for the late reply, puppy pooped in the house
[07:29:07] <krambiorix> Velveeta, any idea how to solve
[07:30:42] <BillCriswell> I'd love me some native CSS extend.
[07:38:38] <Velveeta> sorry, i was away getting some breakfast, let me scroll back and read everything
[07:39:14] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you'll probably want to make sure the css is set to use fixed positioning for the overlay, no absolute, and that it has a top/bottom/left/right of 0
[07:41:02] <Velveeta> isdp: to do what you're wanting to do, you're gonna need to break that up into 2 pages, or else check for a url variable, and output only the table portion of the markup if it's present
[07:41:49] <iSDP> Velveeta, breaking up into two pages sounds manageable, but then i'd have to load the table data via jQuery all the time
[07:42:07] <Velveeta> no, you could do it with an include() on the php side for the initial page load
[07:42:36] <Velveeta> the other option you would have would be from the client, call back to this same page, and get the entire page worth of markup again in your response, and then slice out only the table portion of it and just overwrite the table with it
[07:56:50] <iSDP> Velveeta, could you explain how i can insert html at a exact location in the html?
[07:57:52] <Velveeta> isdp: if you wanted to overwrite the table itself with the entire table you pull from the server in an ajax request, you could do something like this: $('table').replaceWith(newTableVariable);
[07:58:08] <iSDP> just a part of the table
[07:58:14] <Velveeta> which part?
[07:58:21] <Velveeta> what gettable() returns?
[07:58:33] <Velveeta> then you could just do $('table').html(newTableGuts)
[07:58:46] <iSDP> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/KsXewSA1
[07:58:59] <iSDP> below <tbody> and above <tr>
[07:59:20] <Velveeta> $('table tbody').preprend(newRow)
[07:59:24] <Velveeta> er prepend*
[07:59:47] <iSDP> and showing a little dialog that stuff is loading?
[07:59:51] <iSDP> via $.ajax?
[08:00:22] <Velveeta> you'd have to use something like jquery ui's dialog widget, pop it up at the time you're going to fire the ajax call, and in your ajax success function, call the dialog's 'close' method
[08:01:46] <iSDP> Velveeta, do i have to add onload="load_table()" to the body tag?
[08:02:17] <Velveeta> are you not loading the table as part of the initial page load anymore?
[08:04:12] <iSDP> Velveeta, i've split up the php from the html
[08:06:07] <Velveeta> but from the server side, you can still include that separate file during page load, to render it as part of the initial load
[08:06:22] <Velveeta> but now you also have it separated out for grabbing by itself via ajax when need be
[08:08:18] <iSDP> Velveeta, i've split it up between a php file and a html file
[08:08:28] <iSDP> i want to load the table purely by jQuery now
[08:08:38] <iSDP> how do i load the table on page load?
[08:08:40] <Velveeta> ok, then in that case, i wouldn't use an onload attribute
[08:08:44] <Velveeta> i would use document.ready
[08:08:55] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:37:19] <iSDP> Velveeta, it's not removing all table data when i add a new item
[08:37:25] <iSDP> i've used prepend
[08:37:31] <iSDP> but that just adds the data
[08:37:47] <Velveeta> yeah, because you said you wanted to just add data between the tbody and the first tr
[08:38:20] <BillCriswell> I could go for a hoagie.
[08:38:39] <Velveeta> a hoagie or a hero? or a sub?
[08:38:44] <igcewieling> would it be input:focus.myclass or input.myclass:focus ?
[08:38:58] <Velveeta> igcewieling: input.myclass:focus
[08:39:44] <iSDP> Velveeta, but when i add new data, i want to replace all of it
[08:39:57] <Velveeta> so you just want to refresh all of the tr's in the tbody
[08:40:13] <Velveeta> in that case: $('table tbody').html(yourNewTrs)
[08:40:15] <decx> did benjamin franklin really invent the hoagie?
[08:40:25] <iSDP> Velveeta, no
[08:40:41] <Velveeta> isdp: then be clear about what you want, because my head is spinning at this point
[08:40:52] <iSDP> http://pastebin.com/KsXewSA1 @ line 21, that's where i want the data to be shown and replaced
[08:40:58] <Velveeta> decx: i never heard that, but i'm pretty sure he invented electricity… electricity didn't exist before ben franklin
[08:41:02] <iSDP> the rest shouldn't be tampered with
[08:41:03] <decx> i've got all my historical knowledge from day of the tentacle
[08:41:12] <decx> and that sounds right
[08:41:19] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Philly = Hoagie
[08:41:31] <Velveeta> isdp: so you want to replace everything except for the 1 tr that's left there at the bottom?
[08:41:32] <BillCriswell> Everywhere else = something lame.
[08:41:42] <iSDP> yup
[08:41:59] <iSDP> Velveeta, yup*
[08:42:04] <Velveeta> $('table tbody tr:not(:last)').replaceWith(yourNewTrs);
[08:42:29] <BillCriswell> Ben Franklin invented a lot of stuff and had lots of STDs.
[08:42:29] <iSDP> thanks :D
[08:42:33] <Velveeta> no problem
[08:42:49] <Velveeta> billcriswell: and not just those poor people std's, the fancy ones too
[08:42:58] <BillCriswell> He has them all!
[08:43:05] <BillCriswell> s/has/had*
[08:43:06] <iSDP> Velveeta, and now no tr's are showing up :*
[08:43:09] <iSDP> : ( *
[08:44:05] <BillCriswell> http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/inventions.htm
[08:44:12] <Velveeta> isdp: try this… $('table tbody tr:not(:last)').remove(); $('table tbody').prepend(yourNewTrs);
[08:44:54] <Velveeta> i think he also invented the franklin mint, franklin-covey, and the $20 bill
[08:45:26] <decx> i don'T see hoagie in there.... disappointed !
[08:45:57] <iSDP> Velveeta, that worked :D
[08:46:02] <Velveeta> phew!
[08:46:15] <Velveeta> decx: that's because he hasn't invented it *yet*
[08:46:31] <BillCriswell> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_sandwich This is so much more interesting than it should be.
[08:46:45] <decx> day of the tentacle lied to me, my childhood is all lies!
[08:47:22] <Velveeta> so, here's the thing about sandwiches
[08:47:40] <Velveeta> i think i'm in love with them… if i could eat 1 type of thing for the rest of my life, it would be sandwiches
[08:47:50] <Velveeta> so i'm going to find this wikipedia article just fucking astounding :D
[08:48:32] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I agree. My favorite of all sandwiches would have to be a poboy though.
[08:48:42] <Velveeta> but what kind of poboy?
[08:48:48] <Velveeta> i'm kinda partial to shrimp ones
[08:49:19] <grafi> Velveeta sanity check, when I wrap js in a document ready and I dont have any ajax in place how can a selector (of elements that exist) return nothing?
[08:49:20] <Velveeta> it's hard for me to pinpoint a specific type of sandwich that's my favorite, but it's probably a tossup between grilled cheese and peanut butter and apple jelly
[08:49:31] <BillCriswell> Shrimp / Oysters
[08:49:42] <decx> sadly we dont have much sandwich culture in germany.
[08:50:00] <Velveeta> grafi: because your browser be trippin? …not sure, i'd have to see a code sample
[08:50:11] <decx> according to wikipedia bratwurst&mustard in a bun counts as a sandwich :o
[08:50:19] <Velveeta> decx: seriously? i would have thought germany would be a sandwich mecca of sorts
[08:50:20] <BillCriswell> Called a half and half at the place I go to that has them here in Philly. I love that they get the Leidenheimer bread there as well.
[08:50:32] <BillCriswell> decx: Ick.
[08:50:41] <grafi> at least it happens in chrome and firefox consitently
[08:50:44] <grafi> so thats good :P
[08:50:49] <Velveeta> oh man i would tear up some brats and mustard sandwiches right now
[08:51:35] <decx> we have many different variations of stuff in buns, but personally i wouldn't call that a sandwich
[08:51:58] <decx> a sandwich needs at least 4 layers imho
[08:52:08] <decx> bread, meat, vegetable, sauce
[08:52:24] <Velveeta> what about a peanut butter sandwich, or a cheese sandwich, those don't count?
[08:52:30] <Velveeta> vegetables are *always* optional, btw ;)
[08:53:03] <decx> hm, i guess that's true
[08:53:09] <Velveeta> so if the brats and mustard on bread also had onion or sauerkraut, then that would qualify as a sandwich to you right?
[08:53:15] <Velveeta> that's bread/meat/sauce/veggie
[08:53:20] <`petey`_> what would this line do? where is this context being added? $.data(context[0], "has-button", true);
[08:53:42] <decx> i'm going to eat crow on this and admit that bratwurst,mustard in a bun might as well be called a sandwich ;)
[08:54:04] <Velveeta> `petey`_: based on what you've given us to work with, i can't say, but from what it looks like, it's expecting context to be a jquery-wrapped dom node
[08:54:12] <Velveeta> decx: heheheh
[08:54:18] <Velveeta> mmmmm, crow sandwich
[08:54:44] <`petey`_> http://jsbin.com/sepay/1/edit
[08:55:41] <Velveeta> so that code looks incomplete, but from what i can see, 'menu' is defined somewhere, and is a jquery handle to the menu on the page
[08:55:48] <Velveeta> and it's passing that in as the context
[08:56:27] <`petey`_> I added the event listener to try and figure out what actually happens
[08:56:43] <`petey`_> I don't really get the context[0] part though
[08:57:08] <Velveeta> so, the jquery-wrapped dom node is going to be an object with a property called 0 which is a reference to the actual dom node
[08:57:15] <igcewieling> Velveeta: thanks.
[08:57:24] <digitalice_> hello
[08:57:27] <Velveeta> so they're trying to get a handle to the actual dom node to pass it to the $.data function
[08:57:36] <Velveeta> igcewieling: no problem :)
[08:57:54] <Velveeta> digitalice_: hey
[08:58:10] <digitalice_> Why $("#myform").submit(); send the form data without URL encoding?
[08:58:22] <digitalice_> :O
[08:58:25] <Velveeta> `petey`_: the $.data function expects to be handed a dom node reference, not a jquery reference to a dom node, so that's why they're passing [0] to it
[08:58:53] <`petey`_> so if i inspect this button that's supposed to be added
[08:59:06] <`petey`_> oh ok
[08:59:13] <`petey`_> im just trying to find where "has-button" is
[08:59:16] <Velveeta> digitalice_: .submit() just calls the native browser form submit handler, which should url encode the data… if it's not, then do you have a custom submit handler in place that's preventing the default behavior?
[08:59:22] <`petey`_> i have no idea where to look for "has-button"
[08:59:39] <Velveeta> `petey`_: ahhhhhhh ok, that's a whole other question :) the $.data function doesn't do anything to the dom node itself
[08:59:49] <Velveeta> there's an internal cache object that jquery uses for data binding
[09:00:12] <`petey`_> oh okay
[09:00:14] <Velveeta> if you look at $.cache, you'll find a list of integer keys on it, which correspond to guid's that jquery generates for elements that have data stored in the cache
[09:00:22] <`petey`_> it's more of an abstract feature then?
[09:00:25] <digitalice_> Velveeta, I don't think so, let me check.
[09:00:59] <Velveeta> yeah, you can consider the jquery data cache sort of a facade function of what's actually happening
[09:01:33] <Velveeta> $.data gives you a simplified interface for getting and storing data values related to an element, and appears to store them on the element, when in fact it's storing them in a lookup object outside of the dom
[09:01:50] <`petey`_> oh ok
[09:02:07] <`petey`_> thank you velveeta
[09:02:10] <Velveeta> no problem
[09:08:28] <blue_warlock> hi
[09:08:34] <Velveeta> hola
[09:09:12] <blue_warlock> how do i check if a <li>has <button> ? and if doesnt have add it
[09:09:42] <Velveeta> from what context? the li itself, or just in general at the page level?
[09:09:43] <blue_warlock> i worte this but its not wroking
[09:09:54] <blue_warlock> if ($('.minime li:not(:has(button))')) { $('.minime li:has(ul)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>'); }
[09:11:18] <blue_warlock> this part is what i start from
[09:11:21] <blue_warlock>  $('.minime li:has(ul)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[09:11:35] <blue_warlock> if a li has an ul then add the button
[09:12:06] <blue_warlock> but i have to check if the li has already a button
[09:12:26] <blue_warlock> actually add a button on each resize
[09:12:33] <Velveeta> that selector syntax looks ok at a glance, can you make a jsfiddle example out of it so i can see it actually execute?
[09:16:02] <blue_warlock> quite complicate
[09:18:47] <decx> why repeat the selector?
[09:18:52] <decx> li:has(ul):not(:has(button))
[09:18:59] <decx> shouldnt that work just as well?
[09:20:12] <decx> like here? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8WzJX/
[09:21:02] <BillCriswell> That selector will haunt my dreams.
[09:21:06] <decx> indeed
[09:21:41] <decx> but if you're going to have a bunch of conditionals anyway, might as well take the built in approach
[09:21:42] <decx> ;)
[09:21:58] <blue_warlock> infact i removed it
[09:22:06] <digitalice_> Velveeta, im using typeahead
[09:22:11] <blue_warlock> oh Bill is here !!!
[09:22:17] <Voyage_> hi
[09:22:24] <digitalice_> Velveeta, it does not encode the form when I send it :(
[09:22:33] <Voyage_> how to get value of an input field checkbox. to know whether its checked or not?
[09:22:36] <grafi> Velveeta i fixed it, was the stupid google code prettify that caused hell :P
[09:22:36] <Velveeta> digitalice_: i'm gonna need to see a demo at this point
[09:22:48] <Velveeta> grafi: ahhhhh gotcha
[09:22:54] <blue_warlock> exactlly like that decx
[09:23:03] <Velveeta> voyage_: yourCheckbox.prop('checked')
[09:23:47] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  console.log(yourCheckbox.prop('checked'))  ;   will print "checked" if the checkbox is checked?
[09:23:56] <Velveeta> we should have an instructional page up somewhere that outlines how to make functional demos out of various types of problems, because everybody always says their problem is too complicated to throw together a fiddle over, when we really only need to see a simplified example of the exact problem, not their entire codebase
[09:24:02] <BillCriswell> I ran out of tooth paste today and remembered to get it today instead of running out in the morning like a crazy person. I might actually be growing up.
[09:24:05] <Velveeta> voyage_: it'll give you a boolean true/false
[09:24:26] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  and yourCheckbox can be the class name of the input filed?
[09:24:29] <Voyage_> field?
[09:24:32] <Velveeta> billcriswell: just brush your teeth with coffee, like a real grownup
[09:24:42] <BillCriswell> Ick, coffee.
[09:24:52] <decx> BillCriswell found out this morning that my electronic toothbrush is broken so i just used it manually :(
[09:25:07] <BillCriswell> decx: That must have been rough.
[09:25:15] <Velveeta> voyage_: i was using that in place of a jquery handle to the element itself, however that's done: $('#yourCheckbox').prop('checked') or $('.someCheckboxClass:first').prop('checked') or whatever
[09:25:17] <decx> just isnt the same
[09:25:42] <Velveeta> decx: in the future, you can hold it steady and just shake your head around it
[09:26:01] <BillCriswell> I just pretended to brush my teeth like that.
[09:26:26] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:26:26] <BillCriswell> It would lead to a hell of a headache.
[09:26:32] <Velveeta> yep
[09:26:51] <decx> well headbobbing from old age will just cancel out the handshaking from the arthritis
[09:27:07] <Velveeta> you'll just look like you have parkinson's
[09:27:15] <Velveeta> and then people might buy you free drinks
[09:28:02] <decx> "at this point in life i'm just hoping that at least once when i leave my drink on the bar it'll be spiked when i come back"
[09:29:06] <Velveeta> just spike it yourself, go to the bathroom, come back and drink it, and then wait a few minutes, and turn to the person next to you and be like "diddoo spy m'drinnnnnn" and fall off your stool
[09:29:55] <decx> well imagine that with a funny german accent and you've got yourself a show
[09:30:17] <Velveeta> the real show starts after you hit the floor ;)
[09:32:26] <BillCriswell> decx: Hahaha.
[09:33:16] <grafi> I have a pastebin where the user can select lines to be highlighted, I want to enable users to easily highlight multiple adjacent lines any ideas how to go about that best?
[09:33:31] <grafi> I would use mousedrag or something like that
[09:33:44] <grafi> but of course that also selects the text
[09:33:46] <Velveeta> yeah, mousedown + mousemove is how i'd do it
[09:34:09] <grafi> like what if the user doesnt want to highlight the lines, just copy some text
[09:34:10] <Velveeta> grafi: fixed -- http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/u/user-select/
[09:34:18] <BillCriswell> grafi: Make the code one big select multiple! :-D
[09:34:25] <grafi> and now users cant select text anymore Velveeta :D
[09:34:46] <Velveeta> well yeah… you can't have it both ways, either you want a mouse drag to highlight or you want it to select multiple rows
[09:34:59] <Velveeta> i mean you could always make it conditional based on a hotkey or something
[09:35:00] <grafi> i dont want mouse drag to highlight
[09:35:07] <grafi> i just cant think of another way
[09:35:08] <grafi> :P
[09:35:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: Clicking a line number and holding shift and clicking another isn't ok?
[09:35:38] <grafi> thats a nice idea BillCriswell
[09:35:48] <BillCriswell> Kind of like Gmail does.
[09:35:55] <grafi> gmail highlights lines?
[09:35:58] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[09:35:59] <Velveeta> right?
[09:36:00] <grafi> :D
[09:36:01] <BillCriswell> I make up a lot of shit.
[09:36:03] <Velveeta> lol
[09:36:06] <BillCriswell> Let me try.
[09:36:06] <grafi> i dont use gmail
[09:36:09] <grafi> so no idea
[09:36:10] <grafi> :|
[09:36:13] <Velveeta> i do, but no idea
[09:36:18] <grafi> like to select multiple emails or what
[09:36:34] <Velveeta> holy shit it does
[09:36:39] <grafi> lulz
[09:36:44] <BillCriswell> grafi: Yes.
[09:36:45] <grafi> just like a real program!
[09:36:46] <grafi> :D
[09:37:01] <Velveeta> those must be some whizbang developers they got there at that google company
[09:37:17] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Think it would be that tough to go?
[09:37:19] <grafi> BillCriswell know jump in the code and make me a nice little plugin :D
[09:37:24] <decx> i don't get what you mean
[09:37:30] <decx> select multiple emails?
[09:37:31] <BillCriswell> grafi: I think it would be pretty simple.
[09:37:36] <grafi> maybe
[09:37:47] <BillCriswell> decx: Select an email, then hold shift and click one like 10 emails below it.
[09:37:59] <grafi> decx doesnt have 10 emails
[09:37:59] <grafi> :P
[09:38:00] <Velveeta> i always said i was gonna stay at my current company until google was ready to scoop me up, but then i also heard about them working devs with a whip, and thought "meh, i can do without that kind of environment" but then paul irish and addy osmani both work there and i think "i could bust my ass if it meant i got to learn from them" but then i'd also have to live in california
[09:38:04] <decx> ah right
[09:38:08] <BillCriswell> Hahahha
[09:38:21] <decx> i just dragged mouse and didnt click shift
[09:38:22] <BillCriswell> Reading google interviews I feel like an idiot.
[09:38:34] <Velveeta> where can i read one of those?
[09:38:36] <BillCriswell> decx: no dragging needed for this.
[09:38:40] <grafi> does gmail have any indication as to that this is even a feature?
[09:38:42] <grafi> or something
[09:38:49] <Velveeta> nope
[09:38:50] <BillCriswell> I just came across them on hacker news at times.
[09:38:53] <Velveeta> that means it's for "power users"
[09:38:58] <decx> there are about a million hidden features
[09:39:05] <Fraz> hi
[09:39:16] <grafi> bummer
[09:39:18] <decx> like asking "do you really want to send" if you have "attached" in the inline text but nothing attached
[09:39:23] <Velveeta> one hidden feature is that it allows you to read e-letters that people send to you through the tubes
[09:39:24] <grafi> i would have loved to steal the explanation :D
[09:40:20] <Fraz> im trying to use .post to return a json object, but for some reason it keeps saying the result is undefined
[09:40:32] <Velveeta> decx: they had a drunken email prevention thing you could enable in the labs at one point too, so that after a certain hour, it would prompt you to answer a math question when you clicked send, before it would actually send it
[09:40:46] <decx> lol
[09:40:53] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  <div class=node> <input type=checkbox class=enabled /> </div>        how do I get the checkbox value?
[09:41:02] <Velveeta> fraz: we'll need to see how you're structuring that .post, can you make a jsfiddle example?
[09:41:14] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  I am doing a $.each(.node)
[09:41:30] <Fraz> yes give me a min
[09:41:35] <Velveeta> voyage_: $(this).find(':checkbox.enabled').prop('checked')
[09:41:46] <Voyage_> sory.  $('.node').each(function(){
[09:41:57] <Velveeta> also, you should always wrap your attribute values in quotes, even if it's single words, it's considered best practice
[09:42:06] <Voyage_> yes
[09:42:25] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  .find is for first level?
[09:42:35] <duch_kazatel> .find() is deep.
[09:42:37] <Velveeta> find is for anything in its tree of descendants
[09:42:54] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,   I only need first level
[09:42:55] <Velveeta> you can also do it with just .children() if you're positive it will always be a direct child of that node div
[09:42:58] <decx> for flat structures, find is faster than children, but if you have a complicated child structure and just want the first level then children is faster
[09:43:44] <Voyage_> Velveeta,   $(this).child(':checkbox .enabled').firsth().prop('checked')  ?
[09:44:06] <Velveeta> not quite
[09:44:20] <Velveeta> $(this).children(':checkbox.enabled:first').prop('checked')
[09:44:25] <grafi> hm shift click still selects text
[09:44:26] <grafi> what
[09:44:37] <Velveeta> grafi: muahahaha
[09:44:48] <grafi> its like the browser hates me
[09:44:48] <grafi> :D
[09:45:05] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  thanks. is there an alternative to replace :first with first()  ? <<< just for understanding
[09:45:11] <Velveeta> grafi: how about this… leave the user-select property alone unless a user does a shift+mousedown
[09:45:28] <Velveeta> and on shift+mousedown, disable user-select, and let mousemove highlight your rows
[09:45:34] <Velveeta> and on mouseup, enable user-select again
[09:45:52] <blue_warlock> dam it wont work uff
[09:45:54] <grafi> ugly as fuck :P
[09:45:57] <digitalice_> Velveeta, code is huge ...
[09:45:59] <Velveeta> voyage_: yes, you can replace :first with .first(), but i like to consolidate as much into the selector string as i can for brevity
[09:46:08] <grafi> fingers crossed Velveeta :P
[09:46:18] <grafi> user-select has to be prefixed probably, right?
[09:46:37] <Velveeta> digitalice_: i don't need to see your entire friggin application, just a demonstration of this one snippet of code that's a problem
[09:46:43] <grafi> prefixes everywhere
[09:46:44] <Velveeta> grafi: yuuuuup
[09:46:52] <Velveeta> prefix ALL the properties!
[09:47:16] <digitalice_> Velveeta: will take me ages to take out the javascript, its integrated with a render template
[09:47:20] <Velveeta> digitalice_: conversely, you can point me to a url
[09:47:40] <digitalice_> Velveeta, running on intranet, sorry
[09:47:43] <grafi> -webkit-border :D
[09:47:56] <Whiskey> hehe i need some help like always
[09:47:58] <Velveeta> -webkit-text-decoration
[09:48:20] <Velveeta> -khtml-font-face
[09:48:38] <NoiseEee> kd font face
[09:48:48] <Whiskey> see if i can find an example
[09:48:58] <decx> -mosaic-marquee
[09:49:03] <Velveeta> so the other day, i was on a skype channel at work that we have set up for us FEE's, and we decided to start trying to make insults in css
[09:49:25] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  one example can be like  var email =  ($(this).children(".email").first().val();
[09:49:27] <Velveeta> so i through this one out: #your-mom { width: 200%; } #your-mom .house { overflow: visible; }
[09:49:32] <Velveeta> threw*, not through
[09:49:40] <Voyage_> Velveeta, ?
[09:49:46] <Velveeta> voyage_: yes
[09:50:07] <Velveeta> and then one of the other guys made a joke, and nobody responded, so a 3rd guy chimed in with this:
[09:50:18] <Velveeta> #that-last-joke:after { content: "Crickets"; }
[09:50:29] <Velveeta> and then we all cracked up, because we're a bunch of nerds
[09:50:33] <decx> #your-mom { white-space: nowrap }
[09:50:40] <Velveeta> decx: nice
[09:51:11] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  thanks
[09:51:18] <Velveeta> voyage_: no problemo
[09:51:31] <digitalice_> Velveeta, any idea how to send the form and encoding the parameters in URLEnconding if the browser does not doit by default or is overwritten?
[09:51:57] <BillCriswell> I wish I could use question marks in my variables names sometimes.
[09:52:41] <Velveeta> digitalice_: nope, the browser *will* do it by default, i've never seen a case where it doesn't, and as far as it being overwritten and suppressing the native behavior, you would have to write it in yourself there
[09:53:12] <Velveeta> billcriswell: you can… if you namespace your variables :D var myVars = {}; myVars['isThisAVariable?"] = true;
[09:53:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha yeah, so much more to type though.
[09:53:44] <Velveeta> one of the greatest css jokes i saw on csshumor on twitter one day was something along the lines of:
[09:53:58] <BillCriswell> I guess I could just word is differently.
[09:54:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hrm?
[09:54:25] <Velveeta> #fat-girl-sex { position: absolute: top: 0 !important; } #fat-girl-sex:after { display: none; }
[09:54:40] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh you mean when naming booleans?
[09:54:58] <BillCriswell> if( isShiftPressed ) instead of if( shiftPressed? )... I may have not thought this though.
[09:55:36] <Velveeta> yeah, you typically do an isVarName for those kinds of semantic names
[09:55:54] <Whiskey> How can i save checkbox in a file, if its bocked in its save its in an ini file or whatever, if i uncheck it it removes it
[09:56:19] <Velveeta> whiskey: i have absolutely no idea what you're trying to ask there
[09:56:47] <Fraz> Velveeta, actually i cant cos the response is a php script hosted locally. heres a pstebin of the post >> http://pastebin.com/eHGHbBWW
[09:57:05] <Whiskey> Velveeta? You know what a checkbox is?
[09:57:26] <Velveeta> of course i know what a checkbox is
[09:57:43] <Velveeta> but i don't know what any of this means: if its bocked in its save its in an ini file or whatever, if i uncheck it it removes it
[09:57:50] <Whiskey> if i bock it, so it is yeh set like an option or whatever, how can is save that in a file?
[09:58:06] <Velveeta> what does bock mean?
[09:58:10] <Whiskey> you know save the results of what i have bocked off
[09:58:11] <Fraz> superbock!
[09:58:17] <Whiskey> yeh you know once you set it
[09:58:29] <Velveeta> "check".. when you "check" it
[09:58:44] <Whiskey> ooo check is the word, have no clue about that but yeh :)
[09:58:58] <Velveeta> yes, you check and uncheck a checkbox
[09:59:03] <Velveeta> ok, so one step closer
[09:59:05] <Fraz> you bock checkboxes?
[09:59:08] <Whiskey> found some stuff that save it in cookies, but i would like to have it in a external file
[09:59:11] <Velveeta> so you want to save its state in an ini file or something?
[09:59:11] <Fraz> bockboxes?
[09:59:22] <Whiskey> Velveeta: yeh an external file
[09:59:35] <Velveeta> whiskey: then you're gonna have to post that value to the server and have the server write it to an external file
[09:59:39] <Whiskey> as i plan to use it for private needs, then cookie is a bad option
[10:00:01] <Velveeta> well if it's for private needs, then a cookie is still a perfectly viable option
[10:00:07] <Whiskey> Velveeta: sounds like something you don´t wanne write for me, and sounds offtopic also as that will be PHP i think
[10:00:17] <Velveeta> but if you don't want to use cookies, you're gonna have to post it to the server and let the server write it out to a file
[10:00:19] <Whiskey> Velveeta, not if i lose the cookie
[10:00:27] <Velveeta> what if you lose the file?
[10:00:30] <Fraz> Velveeta, any idea on that json stuff?
[10:00:32] <Whiskey> won´t happen :)
[10:00:42] <Velveeta> fraz: sorry, got sidetracked
[10:00:42] <Whiskey> i don´t save cookies :)
[10:01:01] <Fraz> no worries
[10:01:17] <Whiskey> most be some example how to do this on stackoverflow or something
[10:01:57] <Velveeta> fraz: syntactically that looks valid.. are you sure the endpoint is returning the data properly?
[10:02:32] <Fraz> endpoint? the callback?
[10:02:41] <grafi> well, its kinda working
[10:02:45] <Velveeta> the url itself
[10:02:46] <grafi> thats good
[10:03:00] <Fraz> oh, yeh look at the bottom. thats whats being returned
[10:03:07] <Velveeta> oh whoops, missed that
[10:03:19] <Fraz> im not sure if im looping/accessing the json object correctly tbh
[10:03:37] <Velveeta> fraz: is 'data' itself coming back as undefined, or is the v.title in your each() loop showing undefined?
[10:04:13] <Fraz> nothing is showing undefined now
[10:04:32] <Velveeta> so then what's the issue again?
[10:04:32] <Fraz> im just seeing no output at all in the target div
[10:04:38] <Velveeta> gotcha
[10:04:58] <Whiskey> Velveeta: what do you think?=
[10:05:02] <Velveeta> yeah, i can't see anything wrong in that code snippet, at least nothing obvious
[10:05:16] <Whiskey> If its post jQuery not the answer
[10:05:17] <Velveeta> whiskey: about what? whether stackoverflow would have something about writing out to a file?
[10:05:28] <Whiskey> na about the topic
[10:05:42] <Fraz> velveeta, also if i push a string into the buffer rather than the value, i get no output either
[10:05:49] <Fraz> suggesting what im looping is empty
[10:05:56] <Velveeta> i think in order to do that, you will *have* to send a request to the server from the client to pass the checkbox value to it, and have the server write out to a file for you
[10:06:10] <Velveeta> there's no way from the browser to write a file directly, it violates security settings
[10:06:30] <Velveeta> fraz: what do you get if you console.log(data) on the first line of your callback?
[10:08:39] <Fraz> velveeta, it logs the json object
[10:08:42] <Fraz> so that seems ok
[10:09:07] <Velveeta> ok, and in your .each() loop, if you console.log(v); ?
[10:10:12] <Fraz> nothing
[10:10:22] <Voyage_>   if ($(this).children(':checkbox.enabled:first').prop('checked')){    how to explode   (':checkbox.enabled:first').
[10:10:48] <Velveeta> fraz: try console.log(arguments) inside of that loop
[10:11:14] <Velveeta> voyage_: pull the :first out of the selector and make it .first() instead
[10:11:32] <Velveeta> but why do you seem hung up on having that outside of the selector? they're functionally equivalent
[10:11:44] <Voyage_>   if ($(this).children(':checkbox.enabled:first').prop('checked')){    can become   ($(this).children(':checkbox.enabled').first().prop('checked')){
[10:11:45] <Voyage_> ?
[10:12:15] <Velveeta> yep
[10:12:28] <Voyage_> why (':checkbox.enabled')   and not   (':checkbox .enabled')
[10:12:40] <Fraz> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/LiT3ibmS
[10:12:49] <Voyage_> or  ('.enabled :checkbox)
[10:12:51] <grafi> Velveeta BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/a2JxQ/ :D
[10:12:55] <grafi> seems to work
[10:13:09] <Velveeta> because one is hierarchical and the other is inclusive.. one says "the checkbox that has class 'enabled'" and the other says "the checkbox that has an element inside of it that has class 'enabled'"
[10:13:20] <Voyage_> or  ('.enabled input[:checkbox])
[10:13:25] <Velveeta> and the 3rd says "the element with class enabled that has a checkbox inside of it"
[10:13:36] <decx> that wouldnt work in children anyway would it?
[10:13:37] <Velveeta> and that last selector isn't valid
[10:13:47] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  rephrase:  why (':checkbox.enabled')   and not  (':checkbox .enabled')  or  ('.enabled :checkbox)    or  ('.enabled input[:checkbox])
[10:13:50] <Velveeta> decx: yeah i don't think it would
[10:14:00] <Velveeta> voyage_: i just answered all 4 of those cases
[10:14:03] <BillCriswell> grafi: Should it be selecting all the betweens with a shift?
[10:14:26] <grafi> should it not?
[10:14:29] <grafi> does it not?
[10:14:29] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  oh you ddint mentioned my name. i missed your comment. let me read
[10:14:31] <grafi> it should :P
[10:15:32] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  so the first 3 are valid?  :  (':checkbox.enabled')   (':checkbox .enabled')  or  ('.enabled :checkbox)    or  ('.enabled input[:checkbox])
[10:15:50] <Velveeta> the first 3 are valid, yes, but they don't have the same meaning, they all mean something different
[10:16:01] <BillCriswell> Not working for me I don't think grafi
[10:16:06] <grafi> chrome BillCriswell ?
[10:16:13] <Velveeta> the first selector is the proper one, the next 2 are improper for what you're wanting, and the last is invalid altogether
[10:16:15] <Voyage_> Voyage_,  input[]  is a valud jquery syntax. isnt it
[10:16:20] <Voyage_> Velveeta, ^
[10:16:24] <BillCriswell> Yes. I'm clicking line one, holding shift and clicking line 10.
[10:16:24] <Velveeta> yes, but input[:checkbox] is not
[10:16:26] <grafi> apparently event.key is blissfully undefined in chrome :D
[10:16:33] <Velveeta> input[type="checkbox"] is, but not input[:checkbox]
[10:16:45] <Velveeta> grafi: use event.which
[10:16:56] <Velveeta> if you're wanting a keycode
[10:17:05] <grafi> so basically event.keyCode?
[10:17:06] <Velveeta> if you're wanting whether shift was pressed, then use event.shiftKey
[10:17:33] <grafi> is event.shiftKey cross browser oô
[10:17:43] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure, yes, jquery should normalize that
[10:18:01] <grafi> cool stuff
[10:18:06] <grafi> better than 16
[10:18:06] <grafi> ^^
[10:18:27] <Velveeta> as for event.which, it's a property that normalizes certain info about the event, like which mouse button was clicked in mouse events, or which key was pressed for key events
[10:18:38] <grafi> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/a2JxQ/1/ this should work
[10:18:39] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  how can it be handled by input[]?
[10:18:53] <Voyage_>  if ($(this).children(':checkbox.enabled:first').prop('checked')){
[10:18:59] <BillCriswell> grafi: Crashed chrome on me lol
[10:19:03] <grafi> lol nice
[10:19:04] <grafi> :D
[10:19:05] <BillCriswell> Try that again.
[10:19:07] <Velveeta> voyage_: first, why do you keep asking for alternate methods of getting this info?
[10:19:08] <Fraz> console.log(v.title) outputs the title:S
[10:19:14] <grafi> running fine in chrome for me :|
[10:19:15] <BillCriswell> YEs. Consistently crashing Chrome.
[10:19:25] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  just to eliminate my confusion
[10:19:26] <Velveeta> is it just for your learning process, or is it because for some reason, you have a problem with the syntax?
[10:19:32] <Velveeta> ok
[10:19:43] <Voyage_> learning process.
[10:19:55] <BillCriswell> Let me try restarting.
[10:19:55] <Velveeta> to do it with an input selector, you would do this: $(this).children('input[type="checkbox"].enabled').first().prop('checked')
[10:20:12] <Velveeta> :checkbox == input[type="checkbox"], it's just shorthand
[10:20:19] <grafi> osx problems BillCriswell :D
[10:20:35] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  greate
[10:20:36] <BillCriswell> Still crashing it.
[10:20:37] <Fraz> how come its showing in the console, but alert(v.title) is undefined
[10:20:39] <Velveeta> fraz: ok, let me take another look at it
[10:20:43] <grafi> fuck
[10:20:45] <BillCriswell> That's pretty funny.
[10:20:45] <grafi> that sucks
[10:20:47] <grafi> :|
[10:21:11] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  so  $(this).children('.enabled input[type="checkbox"]').first().prop('checked')    is not valid
[10:21:21] <BillCriswell> Haha "Inspected Target Crashed"
[10:21:22] <Voyage_> the checkbox is inside the class=enabled
[10:21:34] <grafi> BillCriswell you think constantly setting variables is bad? :D
[10:21:53] <Velveeta> voyage_: correct, it's a valid selector string, but not the selector you're looking for
[10:21:59] <Velveeta> because the space makes it hierarchical
[10:22:25] <BillCriswell> grafi: I kept tring to code it outbut kept thinking of different ways... when I do that too many times I take a break.
[10:22:27] <Velveeta> fraz: oh, i think i see your problem
[10:22:32] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  oh. the space says that look underneath the node
[10:22:37] <Fraz> oh?
[10:22:37] <Voyage_> how about this? Velveeta  :
[10:22:43] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  so  $(this).children('.enabled.input[type="checkbox"]').first().prop('checked')    is not valid
[10:22:44] <Velveeta> you're doing buffer.push[v.title]; instead of buffer.push(v.title); brackets vs parens
[10:22:51] <Fraz> ahhh
[10:22:54] <Fraz> pahaha
[10:23:12] <Fraz> code blindness lol
[10:23:13] <Fraz> thanks
[10:23:26] <Velveeta> voyage_: that would look for an element with a class of 'enabled' *and* a class of 'input[type="checkbox"]' because you're using a concatenated class selector
[10:23:36] <Fraz> thats better
[10:23:41] <Velveeta> so you'd want the tag name first, and then concatenate a class name onto it
[10:23:45] <Velveeta> fraz: woo hoo!
[10:24:07] <Fraz> cant beleive i didnt see that:(
[10:24:15] <Voyage_> then the concatination  is also happening in input[type="checkbox"].enabled
[10:24:17] <Velveeta> grafi: i'll see if i can whip up a fiddle to demonstrate a way to do it
[10:24:27] <Voyage_> Velveeta, ^
[10:24:32] <grafi> Velveeta it works fine :P
[10:24:36] <grafi> just not for BillCriswell :D
[10:24:42] <Velveeta> voyage_: yes, but you're saying "find an input with type="checkbox" as an attribute, that *also* has the class enabled"
[10:24:48] <Velveeta> grafi: ahhh gotcha
[10:24:55] <grafi> not sure why though
[10:25:02] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  and both will not give same results?
[10:25:23] <Velveeta> you mean putting the classname before the tag name, or vice versa?
[10:25:36] <Voyage_> yes
[10:26:04] <Velveeta> nope, because there's no way to put the tag name 2nd, and concatenate it
[10:26:19] <Voyage_> hm
[10:26:20] <Voyage_> thx
[10:26:38] <Velveeta> because if you did this in a selector: $('.enabledinput[type="checkbox"]') it would see that all as a class name
[10:26:54] <Velveeta> but if you did $('.enabled.input[type="checkbox"]') it would see it as a double-class selector
[10:27:09] <Velveeta> and if you did $('.enabled input[type="checkbox"]') it would see it as hierarchical
[10:27:30] <jcrawford> hello everyone, I am having some problems with jquery and IE 7 giving an error about a property or method not existing.  Everything works just fine in IE 8 and above.  The lines of code giving me the issues are the following: $ = this; $.MSCValidator();
[10:27:50] <jcrawford> I have jQuery.noConflict() being called so I am not quite sure why IE7 would be getting lost here any advice or suggestions?
[10:28:24] <Velveeta> jcrawford: can we see a fiddle of a sample of that file?
[10:28:38] <jcrawford> sure moment
[10:28:54] <Velveeta> usually with noConflict, you would say something like var myVar = jQuery.noConflict(); and then use myVar as your jquery reference
[10:29:08] <Velveeta> so i'm a little confused seeing the $ = this
[10:29:20] <jcrawford> although the fiddle will not work because this code is a tangled mess lol
[10:29:31] <Velveeta> no that's fine, i just want to see how it looks syntactically
[10:29:56] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/5ckkp/
[10:30:27] <jcrawford> i didnt write any of this code, it's from another developer but i have been tasked with determining why IE7 is not working well
[10:30:41] <Velveeta> interesting
[10:31:39] <Velveeta> i'm not sure why that's working in any browser, i would expect that in the namespace of $, 'this' would be the window object
[10:31:58] <Velveeta> also, i don't see any calls to noConflict in there
[10:32:05] <jcrawford> works in all browsers except IE <= 7
[10:32:12] <Velveeta> right
[10:32:14] <jcrawford> yea it's included in a noConflict.js file
[10:32:21] <jcrawford> after all these files are included
[10:32:43] <jcrawford> im not sure why they include the single line in it's own js file other than to include it in any page they wanted
[10:32:51] <Velveeta> what happens if you swap out all of those internal references to 'jQuery' to just be 'this' instead?
[10:33:15] <Velveeta> i mean, inside of the jquery src, they don't typically reference jQuery.functionName, they just call this.functionName
[10:33:20] <jcrawford> no idea, i am not sure the meaning of why this code was written like this
[10:33:44] <jcrawford> but thats just an alias right i mean JQuery = this;
[10:33:50] <Fraz> you can use + and += for concatenation in js right?
[10:34:48] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It's things like this that make me appreciate what angular does.
[10:34:48] <BillCriswell> The selected lines dealie.
[10:35:48] <Velveeta> jcrawford: maybe try replacing that whole chunk with something like this instead, to encapsulate the scope: http://jsfiddle.net/5ckkp/1/
[10:35:56] <Velveeta> fraz: yep
[10:36:27] <Velveeta> billcriswell: how does angular make the selected lines dealie any easier? you would still have to write a directive that handled those events properly wouldn't you?
[10:37:02] <jcrawford> Velveeta: i will give it a shot, moment
[10:37:03] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I just mean like keeping it in variables instead of having it in the dom if that makes sense?
[10:37:32] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i'm not sure i follow
[10:37:55] <BillCriswell> var lines = [ { selected: false, text: "I am line 1" }, ... ]; easier to work with that then an HTML list I think.
[10:38:31] <Velveeta> sure, but how do you populate that array?
[10:38:43] <Velveeta> it still needs to be populated from actual html data
[10:38:58] <Velveeta> this is the kind of shit that angular does that i have a problem with :D <li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:query | orderBy:orderProp”>{{item.name}}</li>
[10:39:34] <jcrawford> that did not stop the issue, still complains when it is instanciated
[10:39:53] <Velveeta> what's the error it's throwing?
[10:40:51] <jcrawford> originally it states that this object does not support this property or method
[10:41:00] <Velveeta> does it say what the property/method is?
[10:41:02] <jcrawford> i had to use the IE debugger in IE7 mode to find the line that was causing the issue
[10:41:14] <Velveeta> ok, so where's it throwing up?
[10:41:21] <jcrawford> using the IE8 debugger in IE7 mode it shows the line i showed before
[10:41:31] <jcrawford> $ = this; $.MSCValidator();
[10:41:41] <Velveeta> the one where jQuery = this; was done?
[10:41:45] <jcrawford> which is the first line of registerValidator : function () {
[10:41:53] <jcrawford> no this is in another file, moment will add it to the fiddle
[10:42:00] <Velveeta> gotcha
[10:42:24] <igcewieling> Apparently I don't understand selectors 8-(   http://jsfiddle.net/dx2kx/2/ is generating a Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'html" error.  Can anyone give insight?
[10:42:47] <Velveeta> also, when you report back with the fix for this, make sure to let your boss(es) know that XP support is being end-of-lifed in a couple months and that they should use it as an excuse to end-of-life your own support of IE7 ;)
[10:43:22] <jcrawford> http://pastie.org/private/vbahhiqf3ls6yxanfrkkwa
[10:43:25] <Voyage_> will an IDE made in JS / jQuery be more faster and feature full in terms of UI ?
[10:43:36] <Velveeta> igcewieling: that each loop will return the dom node in each slot of that jquery collection, but it's a raw dom node, not a jquery reference, inside the callback, so you need to wrap it in an jquery constructor
[10:43:45] <mehwork> any jquery mobile experts know why the menu animation doesn't run when you click to expand the menu: http://jsfiddle.net/dMu9q/6/
[10:43:55] <Velveeta> igcewieling: http://jsfiddle.net/dx2kx/5/
[10:43:56] <jcrawford> yea well unfortunately a lot of our "customers" are from China and china relies on IE and heavilly modified variations of IE so they want it to work well for any browser for this submission process
[10:44:16] <Velveeta> voyage_: faster and more feature full than what?
[10:44:40] <grafi> hm does keyup only work on inputs or something oô
[10:44:45] <igcewieling> Velveeta: thank you for the help, that was it.
[10:44:49] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  than a java made UI with swing or javafx or c# made UI or c++ made UI
[10:45:02] <jcrawford> Velveeta: sorry i put it up on pastie rather than in the fiddle its a really long piece of code :)
[10:45:12] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  its a comparison between a desktop UI and  a broswer based UI made by JS / jQuery
[10:45:13] <grafi> nvm
[10:45:16] <Velveeta> igcewieling: no problem
[10:45:48] <Velveeta> voyage_: i would think those other UI's would be faster as they're compiled down to byte code, are you talking about making an IDE in nodejs or something, or one for the browser?
[10:46:17] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  yes, node.js ,  or pure browser based
[10:46:29] <Velveeta> voyage_: i would think that, at feature parity, the one made in the compiled language would probably be faster, but it's only a guess
[10:46:47] <|RicharD|> hi to all, there is some library for do an effect(animation scrolling) like this ? https://onlycoin.com/
[10:47:00] <Velveeta> jcrawford: yeah this is fine, what happens if you wrap that block in a similar closure and ditch the .extend() ?
[10:47:12] <jcrawford> let me check
[10:47:15] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  and the features ?
[10:47:28] <Velveeta> voyage_: which features?
[10:47:30] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  and ease of development
[10:47:35] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  UI controls i mean
[10:47:41] <Velveeta> that's entirely dependent on the developers in question
[10:47:46] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  rapid development i mean
[10:47:49] <Velveeta> you can't measure man-hours in language
[10:48:10] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  i mean some languages are made for some special things.
[10:48:17] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  using the right tool for the job
[10:48:33] <Velveeta> |richard|: http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[10:49:04] <Velveeta> voyage_: right, but most languages are suitable for most purposes.. i would probably *not* try to write an IDE in javascript, unless it was specifically meant for running in the browser
[10:49:10] <grafi> Velveeta turns out event.shiftKey is false on keyup event :D
[10:49:18] <|RicharD|> Velveeta: You think that I can do all this with superscrollorama ? I had already found it, now I study all doc
[10:49:23] <|RicharD|> but seems hard
[10:49:39] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  the advantage would be that it will run in a mobile too. ie any where a browser can run
[10:49:48] <Velveeta> |richard|: i would *think* you can, but i'm not positive, i don't use any of that kind of sorcery in my own work
[10:50:21] <Velveeta> voyage_: right, but how much occasion is there for people to do development work on a mobile phone?
[10:50:25] <|RicharD|> ahahaha thank you :)
[10:50:38] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  good point
[10:50:41] <Velveeta> grafi: that's weird
[10:50:49] <grafi> yeah
[10:50:55] <grafi> i switched to which now
[10:51:00] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  IDE was a bad example. there might be other examples though
[10:51:04] <Velveeta> it's a good thing my brain is multithreaded, because good lawd the conversations :D
[10:51:25] <Velveeta> voyage_: right, if you look at some wysiwyg editors out there like fckeditor or tinymce, they're all written in js
[10:51:45] <decx> and they're all terrible
[10:51:51] <Voyage_> those editors are desktop apps?
[10:51:53] <Voyage_> Velveeta,
[10:51:57] <Velveeta> i can't say they're more performant than anything written in a traditional language
[10:52:09] <Velveeta> voyage_: no, they're meant to be run inside of a browser
[10:52:38] <jcrawford> Velveeta: same issues nothing changed
[10:52:46] <Velveeta> jcrawford: can i see an updated pasted?
[10:52:48] <Velveeta> paste*
[10:52:51] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  can i obfuscate JS?
[10:53:01] <Velveeta> voyage_: absolutely, look into uglifyjs
[10:53:39] <Voyage_> :)
[10:53:39] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  the method names will be changed with garbage names. comments deleted. nothing else that would be special?
[10:53:46] <Velveeta> right
[10:53:48] <jcrawford> http://pastie.org/8709526
[10:54:18] <Velveeta> jcrawford: close, let me tweak that some
[10:54:20] <jcrawford> oh i forgot the JQuery at the end, moment
[10:54:22] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  so my JS will be read but cant be modified easily?
[10:54:22] <jcrawford> ok
[10:55:55] <Velveeta> voyage_: here's a page where you can see an example of the uglified version of any js you throw at it: http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs
[10:56:04] <Velveeta> you can also look into google's closure compiler
[10:57:26] <Velveeta> jcrawford: try this: http://pastie.org/8709541
[10:57:51] <jcrawford> testing it now
[10:58:43] <Velveeta> voyage_: and if you're using a build tool like grunt, you can use the uglify module for it to obfuscate more than that
[10:59:13] <jcrawford> more errors now
[10:59:15] <jcrawford> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : /ef/js/subform.js?v=1391799500:125
[10:59:15] <jcrawford> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'registerMaskedInput'
[10:59:48] <jcrawford> seems there are more functions that need to be modified heh
[10:59:52] <Velveeta> ok, let me see what i missed
[11:00:16] <Velveeta> oh yeah i see where i missed
[11:00:58] <Velveeta> ok, try this one: http://pastie.org/8709551
[11:03:06] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  no, most obfuscaters just do eval(function.. garbage that can be decoded easily)  thats not replacing method names and vars at random
[11:03:42] <Velveeta> well that's true, but you can't randomly replace method and variable names, because you never know what external code may be calling them
[11:03:50] <jcrawford> Velveeta: the error remains the same
[11:03:54] <Voyage_> http://packer.50x.eu/ for eg
[11:04:13] <Velveeta> all you can do is set it up in a way that it's not easily human-readable, but the javascript compiler will interpret it with the exact same names
[11:04:27] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  it would be  a search and replace for a var in full project then
[11:04:30] <jcrawford> its as if IE7 cannot see that $.MSCValidator(); in line 136 of subform.js
[11:05:05] <Velveeta> jcrawford: it's possible that it can't see it, if it's a race condition going on
[11:05:27] <duch_kazatel> IE11's caching strikes again!
[11:05:32] <duch_kazatel> holy christ this has been a hell of a day.
[11:05:34] <Voyage_> Velveeta,   replace  myVar() with    abc()   in the full project, same for var names.       so callers will also be replaced by abc.         the code wont break and no one will know what "abc" meant
[11:05:40] <Velveeta> jcrawford: are these files all loaded via script tags? synchronously?
[11:05:45] <jcrawford> yea i will have to dig through this thanks for all the assistance
[11:05:53] <jcrawford> yea they are loaded in the <head>
[11:06:05] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  isnt there such tool?
[11:06:09] <Velveeta> voyage_: right, and as far as i know, there's nothing that does that… *possibly* google's closure compiler, but i'm not sure
[11:06:34] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  is it _possible_ ?
[11:06:41] <Velveeta> jcrawford: and if you console.log($.MSCValidator) i'm assuming you get undefined?
[11:06:51] <Velveeta> voyage_: anything is possible
[11:07:06] <Velveeta> the question is, is there a tool that currently does it
[11:07:08] <jcrawford> does IE have a console :)
[11:07:22] <jcrawford> everything works in all other browsers here
[11:07:52] <Velveeta> jcrawford: if you go download visual studio web developer express edition, you can launch your site using it as your debugger (for native IE7) and set breakpoints and inspect values within VS
[11:08:05] <Velveeta> that's how i typically have to debug IE7
[11:08:09] <jcrawford> yea that may be my final option :)
[11:08:24] <jcrawford> thanks i will go dig into this i appreciate the assistance
[11:08:33] <Velveeta> no problem, let me know if you find the problem
[11:08:42] <grafi> BillCriswell up to try another approach, hopefully not crashing your browser?
[11:08:52] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha sure thing.
[11:08:57] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/a2JxQ/4/
[11:09:04] <BillCriswell> I'm waiting for this site to push, it's been 5 god damn hours.
[11:09:08] <grafi> press shift once toggles multi select mode
[11:09:15] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  hm, are you interested in making such tool?
[11:09:18] <grafi> press shift another time untoggles mode
[11:09:34] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  so that it would be hard for others to steal hardwork
[11:09:36] <Velveeta> voyage_: not even remotely :D
[11:09:43] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  oh.
[11:09:49] <Velveeta> i'm actually very into the idea of open sourcing work
[11:09:54] <jcrawford> will do
[11:10:08] <Velveeta> and that tool seems like too much of a headache for me to try to come up with
[11:10:11] <BillCriswell> grafi: No crashing!
[11:10:19] <grafi> does it work too?
[11:10:19] <grafi> :D
[11:10:19] <LLKCKfan> Is there any natural ways to relieve pain without using herbs or weed? No drugs
[11:10:31] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  ya but imagine you made an app comercially and some one just copy pasted yours and launched at the same time
[11:11:10] <Velveeta> llkckfan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YziagkVsWY
[11:11:33] <Velveeta> voyage_: then it should be very easy to prove that they stole your IP and you could file a lawsuit
[11:14:42] <LLKCKfan> No help
[11:14:50] <Velveeta> interesting, facebook is down "for required maintenance" in the middle of the day
[11:15:46] <Velveeta> llkckfan: you can try the bradley method..
[11:15:49] <Velveeta> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_method_of_natural_childbirth
[11:15:57] <expfist> I just upgraded my jquery and now I'm getting a bunch of errors. Anyone have an idea why? (push submit registration) https://tracker.recursion.tk/unstable/?p=c&c=register
[11:16:17] <LLKCKfan> Notchild birth
[11:16:29] <Velveeta> pain is pain
[11:17:37] <Velveeta> expfist: one problem i can see is 'cannot call method "removeClass" of undefined' because you're trying to use a fields variable before it's had a chance to initialize
[11:18:34] <Velveeta> expfist: i also see no reference to $.fn.dialog… are you loading jquery ui?
[11:18:40] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  I see that the googles closure compiler does the same thing as uglifyjs do. strips white space and deletes comments. thats it.  so google closure is better
[11:19:47] <expfist> It should be loading at the top of the page. The button itself is jquery-ui
[11:20:08] <Velveeta> voyage_: if you use the advanced compilation option, it renames things for you also
[11:20:13] <expfist> What's the easiest way to solve the fields variable issue? It was working previously so I'm stumped
[11:20:50] <Velveeta> expfist: you have a document.ready wrapper around the initialization, but then outside of that, you're immediately invoking removeClass on it, which means that code is going to execute before document.ready fires the initialization
[11:21:11] <Velveeta> i'm not sure why that ever worked, but you should move that removeClass line inside of the document.ready wrapper
[11:22:08] <Velveeta> expfist: also, i do see draggable as an available function, but not dialog, are you sure you selected that as part of your jquery ui bundle?
[11:23:23] <Velveeta> yeah, when i open your jquery ui js file itself, i find no dialog widget in it
[11:23:50] <expfist> oh whoops
[11:24:00] <expfist> I thought I just replaced it with the 'all' version, but I'll check that out
[11:24:24] <Velveeta> so that should fix the first issue i saw in my console, which was that dialog was undefined and not a function
[11:24:46] <Velveeta> the 2nd issue w/ the fields variable not having a removeClass function should be fixed once you move it into the document.ready wrapper
[11:25:31] <expfist> If you refresh I did that, but now it's complaining about other vars I process on the json response
[11:25:35] <Velveeta> and you might want to consider moving that $.post call inside of it
[11:25:53] <expfist> INside of the document ready?
[11:26:05] <Velveeta> i'm still getting the dialog error on refresh
[11:26:43] <Velveeta> but yes, that post is firing before document.ready, so it's possible for it to complete before document.ready also, and try to reference dom nodes that haven't been initialized yet
[11:26:58] <Velveeta> which is what it sounds like it's doing when you say it's complaining about other vars you process
[11:27:35] <expfist> Hmm yay
[11:27:41] <Velveeta> working?
[11:27:52] <expfist> I must have failed to upload the 'everything' version when I tried
[11:28:09] <expfist> Seems to work, and I put the post inside that as you suggested
[11:28:11] <expfist> THanks a ton
[11:28:17] <expfist> I'll rework the rest of my code the same way
[11:28:18] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[11:28:31] <Velveeta> so you don't have to put function definitions inside of document.ready, just fyi
[11:28:44] <Velveeta> just make sure you don't call them until document.ready, if they do anything to manipulate the dom
[11:28:52] <expfist> Is it better that I do?
[11:29:16] <Velveeta> i don't put my function declarations inside of document.ready, because it waits until the document is ready to actually create them
[11:29:27] <expfist> Ahh
[11:29:32] <Velveeta> you just need to make sure they're not executed until document ready, if they do any dom manipulation
[11:29:46] <Velveeta> so put the *calls* to them inside of your document ready wrapper
[11:30:14] <expfist> Alright, I'll do that
[11:30:32] <expfist> They do manipulate the dom, so I probably should
[11:30:33] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm gonna pry myself away from the keyboard and go do some dishes, yay me
[11:30:50] <expfist> I'm going to get some cheese, because your name made me crave it
[11:31:01] <expfist> Thanks for that ;)
[11:31:02] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:37:27] <`petey`_> what am i doing wrong here? http://jsbin.com/lutu/1/edit
[11:41:13] <mehwork> any jquery mobile experts know why the menu animation doesn't run when you click to expand the menu: http://jsfiddle.net/dMu9q/6/
[11:45:05] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  renaming dont work http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[11:47:45] <Fraz> say i have a div, and i want to hide it when i click anywhere but on this div or a parent of it, how would i do that?
[11:48:02] <Voyage_> Velveeta,  or I am on mistake?
[11:49:28] <zumba_addict> is this deferred written correctly? http://pastebin.com/dnQZ2aeB
[11:49:29] <dismist> $('body:not(.divclass)').click(function() { $('.vidclass').hide(); } });
[11:49:59] <Fraz> ohh thanks dismist
[11:54:47] <ryanneufeld> Fraz: actually, I wouldn't do that
[11:56:43] <ryanneufeld> Fraz: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/
[11:57:01] <ryanneufeld> Fraz: I built it to handle a similar such situation
[11:58:24] <Voyage> the renaming of variables and methods dont work for advanced option. renaming dont work http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home    or am I on mistake?
[11:59:34] <duch_kazatel> Voyage you should probably ask the clojure folks.
[12:00:01] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  in which channel?
[12:00:16] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  is there an app that can obfuscate by renaming vars/functions?
[12:00:47] <duch_kazatel> Voyage sure - uglify
[12:00:54] <ryanneufeld> Voyage: did you try #clojure
[12:00:55] <mdev> lol at uglify
[12:00:56] <duch_kazatel> Voyage there's also #clojure
[12:00:58] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel you're confusing clojure with closure compiler
[12:01:06] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  ok
[12:01:17] <BinaryKitten> Voyage #clojure won't help wih that
[12:01:18] <duch_kazatel> woops, BinaryKitten is right.
[12:01:19] <duch_kazatel> long day.
[12:01:37] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel it has been hasn't it
[12:01:39] <ryanneufeld> Voyage: it won't rename any public or globlally scoped vars
[12:01:43] <ryanneufeld> or functions
[12:02:00] <ryanneufeld> it will only rename scoped variables
[12:02:01] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  ryanneufeld  BinaryKitten  there are too many uglify links on google by many devs
[12:02:15] <decx> thanks for the snippet ryanneufeld this seems like a good approach as an alternative to an overlay div in situations like cliick outside a drowndown menu to close it
[12:02:20] <duch_kazatel> voyage what problem are you trying to solve?
[12:02:26] <decx> didnt know you could return .on
[12:02:33] <BinaryKitten> Voyage if it's not obsfucating to the degree you want, either the code is bad or you need to just re-work it
[12:02:39] <decx> but it does make sense now that i think about it
[12:02:50] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  is there an app that can obfuscate by renaming vars/functions?
[12:03:02] <ryanneufeld> decx: I used it when we were serving clickable background ads
[12:03:10] <Voyage> BinaryKitten,  who is not obfuscating?
[12:03:38] <BinaryKitten> closure-compiler .. or so i thought you said
[12:03:52] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  which is the correct official link for uglify?
[12:04:23] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS here's one option.
[12:04:23] <BinaryKitten> Voyage be careful.. if you try to push that too hard, you will not have working code
[12:04:26] <Voyage> BinaryKitten,  yes, its not renaming its fucntions or methods. the one that were in demo
[12:04:29] <duch_kazatel> Voyage what are you trying to do?
[12:04:48] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  iobfuscate by renaming vars/functions
[12:05:03] <Voyage> BinaryKitten,  the hello world example on the page i mean
[12:05:22] <duch_kazatel> Voyage you realize that anything you minify I can deminify, right?
[12:05:27] <BinaryKitten> at this point, i'm wondering what this has to do with jQuery
[12:05:57] <Vivekananda> I am trying to located cool dropdown menu in a way such that each word in a drodown menu when clicked further opens a dropdown
[12:06:22] <Vivekananda> can someone suggest a way to do it ? where can I find exmples and also ways of populating such a div ?
[12:07:06] <Vivekananda> the only place I know till yet of looking up is on the jquery demo page but are there other places I can look at ?
[12:07:13] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  minifing is removing white space.  obfuscating is also renaming variables/ function names.  Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic, in order to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code.
[12:07:29] <duch_kazatel> Voyage lol
[12:07:31] <Voyage> BinaryKitten,  ryanneufeld  ^
[12:07:38] <duch_kazatel> Voyage I can deobfuscate code.
[12:07:58] <BinaryKitten> i don't need pretty named functions or variables to understand code
[12:08:13] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  .. how?
[12:08:16] <BinaryKitten> yes, it might make my developer life slightly more annoying
[12:08:24] <BinaryKitten> but it's not anything important
[12:08:38] <BinaryKitten> the only reason closure compiler "obsfucates"
[12:08:43] <Voyage> BinaryKitten,  ya, but the time you would take to understand non-pretty == time to recode it from scratch
[12:08:44] <BinaryKitten> is to reduce code size
[12:08:51] <Voyage> thats all the point is
[12:09:03] <ryanneufeld> Voyage: obfuscation is not worth it
[12:09:05] <BinaryKitten> Voyage actually less than that
[12:09:05] <duch_kazatel> Voyage there are deobfuscation tools readily available.
[12:09:12] <Velveeta> voyage: i've already answered that question for you, google's closure compiler
[12:09:13] <ryanneufeld> Voyage: but you want to look at something called packer
[12:09:29] <Velveeta> run it with the advanced optimization and it will do those renamings for you
[12:10:02] <Voyage> Velveeta,  renaming dont work http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home      I mean function / var renaming
[12:10:23] <Voyage> Velveeta,  am.. how to run that site with the advanced optimization
[12:10:31] <BinaryKitten> anyway Voyage i still fail to see how this connects with jQuery
[12:10:36] <Velveeta> you'll have to read the documentation to figure that part out
[12:11:12] <Voyage> Velveeta,   --create_name_map_files     If true, variable renaming and
[12:11:12] <Voyage>                                           property renaming map files will be
[12:11:12] <Voyage>                                           produced as {binary name}_vars_map.out
[12:11:12] <Voyage>                                           and {binary name}_props_map.out. Note
[12:11:12] <Voyage>                                           that this flag cannot be used in
[12:11:13] <Voyage>                                           conjunction with either variableMapOut
[12:11:14] <Voyage>                                           putFile or property_map_output_file
[12:11:16] <Voyage> sory
[12:11:26] <Voyage> thats the only option i saw
[12:11:42] <Velveeta> dude, don't paste stuff like that into the room here
[12:11:47] <Velveeta> direct us to a url
[12:12:10] <Velveeta> https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/compressing-javascript
[12:13:24] <Vivekananda> anyone have suggestions for me ?
[12:14:00] <Voyage> Velveeta,  yes, the doc says "This code looks much less like your original code; it renames all functions to short names, deletes functions it does not believe are used, replaces some function calls with the function body"
[12:14:10] <Velveeta> right
[12:14:28] <Voyage> but when i try to convert one, it does not renames. well take the example of the default function on the page
[12:14:32] <Voyage>  http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[12:14:53] <Voyage> Velveeta,  the output is alert("Hello, New user");
[12:14:55] <Voyage> thats it
[12:15:00] <Voyage> well, actually the result
[12:15:17] <Velveeta> right, because that's the optimized, obfuscated version of that code
[12:15:55] <Linkandzelda> can anyone give me an example of how I can make it impossible ot enter more than 8 decimal places in a textbox? i need to block user input completly
[12:16:51] <dismist> youre going to get the placement of the period in the text box on keypress
[12:17:20] <Velveeta> linkandzelda andganon: you'd have to have a keydown listener to regex against the textbox's value and preventDefault if it matches against something like \d*\.\d{8}
[12:17:24] <dismist> actually explode text contents by . (though this assumes there is only 1 period), then grab the second half of the exploded variable
[12:17:29] <dismist> and check the length of that
[12:18:01] <Voyage> Velveeta,  your correct
[12:19:14] <Velveeta> damnit, i hate it when i see a listing for a js conference and my eyes light up, and then i see it's in another country
[12:19:43] <Linkandzelda> thanks guys for tips
[12:21:44] <BinaryKitten> Velveeta i see that all the time
[12:22:01] <BinaryKitten> last time there was 1 here, it was outside my price trange
[12:22:09] <Velveeta> i just spotted FutureJS in my javascript weekly digest and went "ooOOOoo.. awwww"
[12:22:21] <BinaryKitten> lol
[12:22:28] <BinaryKitten> yeah i just did that too
[12:22:34] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:22:42] <BinaryKitten> that digest will be the death of me
[12:24:02] <Linkandzelda> im struggling to even bind a keydown listener to this
[12:24:30] <Velveeta> i'm gonna try to get an article into it myself one of these days
[12:24:52] <Velveeta> and then the world will know me, fear and respect me
[12:24:57] <Velveeta> PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER
[12:25:08] <BinaryKitten> iddy biddy living space
[12:25:15] <Velveeta> :D
[12:29:02] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: How would you do [].slice.apply( $listItems, [ 0, 3 ]); ?
[12:29:36] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[12:29:46] <Velveeta> lol
[12:30:22] <Velveeta> i'm assuming $listItems is an numerically-indexed object?
[12:30:23] <BillCriswell> Can I avoid doing $( [].slice.apply($listItem, [0,3]) );?
[12:30:30] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: jQuery object.
[12:31:50] <Velveeta> billcriswell: sure, you could do this: $listItem.filter(':lt(4)')
[12:32:02] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: The 0 and 3 are dynamic.
[12:32:10] <Velveeta> i don't think there's a .lt() function like there is for .eq(), but you can filter
[12:32:14] <BillCriswell> $lines.splice( min, max ) is basically what I'm tring to do.
[12:32:54] <Velveeta> $listItems.filter(':lt(' + max + '):gt(' + min + ')') maybe ?
[12:32:56] <dcherman2> BillCriswell: slice, or splice?  two different things
[12:33:06] <BillCriswell> slice.
[12:33:13] <dcherman2> just use $.fn.slice
[12:33:14] <dcherman2> https://api.jquery.com/slice/
[12:33:30] <BillCriswell> dcherman2: Yeah, I'm trying to apply an array as the arguments for that.
[12:33:31] <Velveeta> bless me bagpipes!
[12:33:35] <BillCriswell> Not working very well.
[12:33:49] <Velveeta> billcriswell: an array or a jquery collection?
[12:33:56] <BillCriswell> $lines.slice.apply( range.sort() );
[12:34:07] <BillCriswell> jQuery for $lines, array for range ^
[12:34:25] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/guhuy/2/edit
[12:34:42] <BillCriswell> Is what I'm currently doing, not as elegant as I'd like.
[12:35:18] <Velveeta> oh ok
[12:35:29] <grafi> BillCriswell what are you doing :D
[12:35:33] <Velveeta> $.fn.slide.apply($lines, range)

[12:38:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah the link I sent over works haha

[12:43:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha. I always half ass it then give up.
[12:43:32] <grafi> you are my spirit animal BillCriswell
[12:43:44] <logikos> if i do: var name = "key"; var val = "some value"; var obj = { name : val }; console.log(obj); the obj is { "name" : "some value" } how do i get { "key" : "some value" } ?
[12:43:46] <logikos> please
[12:43:59] <logikos> ex: http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/aKytd
[12:44:07] <Velveeta> mllie: as far as i know, you can only 'focus' on form elements programmatically
[12:44:29] <grafi> at least focus on other elements is by no means cross browser consitent
[12:44:31] <grafi> in any way
[12:44:32] <grafi> :P
[12:44:35] <mllie> Velveeta: so there is no solution for that I want?
[12:44:40] <BillCriswell> grafi: Thanks for the compliment.
[12:44:47] <grafi> <3
[12:47:11] <duch_kazatel> logikos huh
[12:47:47] <logikos> duch_kazatel: basicly i'm just trying to asign a value to an object property where the property name is contained within a local variable
[12:48:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: What's taking you so long.
[12:48:57] <Velveeta> juggling conversations here and on skype also ;)
[12:49:08] <Voyage> margin: 40px 40px 10px 40px;      this is invalid?
[12:49:12] <Voyage> silly question^
[12:49:17] <duch_kazatel> logikos i think you're confused about how objects and properties work.
[12:49:26] <BillCriswell> Slow poke.
[12:49:32] <BillCriswell> That was like 3 minutes ago.
[12:49:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/guhuy/3/edit is the most consistent I can get it for now.
[12:50:07] <logikos> duch_kazatel: no, i'm not confused, but never mind i figured it out
[12:50:12] <duch_kazatel> kay
[12:50:23] <grafi> usar select BillCriswell :
[12:50:32] <BillCriswell> grafi: What does that mean exactly?
[12:50:47] <grafi> that it still selects the text on shift select :D
[12:51:14] <BillCriswell> I can still select the text if I hold shift.
[12:51:23] <grafi> exactly
[12:51:24] <grafi> oô
[12:51:26] <grafi> or something
[12:51:26] <logikos> if i do: var name = "key"; var val = "some value"; var obj = {}; obj[name]=val; i get an object that looks like { "key" : "some value" }
[12:51:31] <logikos> which solves my problem
[12:51:34] <BillCriswell> I shouldn't be able to select the text? lol
[12:51:53] <grafi> u use shift to select multiple lines
[12:52:03] <grafi> doing that should select text

[12:52:09] <grafi> *should NOT
[12:52:10] <grafi> <.<
[12:52:20] <grafi> because shift :P

[12:56:23] <BillCriswell> I have no idea why I want to do this mind you.

[13:01:46] <duch_kazatel> NewYorkSummer what are you doing there?
[13:02:21] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, Just experimenting with .find()
[13:02:26] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, made up a sample doc.
[13:04:17] <duch_kazatel> NewYorkSummer interesting.  you know that .find() does a deep search, yeah?
[13:04:38] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, Any example that doesn't?
[13:05:06] <duch_kazatel> you want just the first level?
[13:05:26] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, Yes.
[13:05:39] <duch_kazatel> .children();
[13:05:50] <duch_kazatel> .children('div') does just the first child level
[13:06:16] <BillCriswell> grafi: I'm thinking about this now and wonder if it's worth it?
[13:06:26] <grafi> what exactly?
[13:07:01] <BillCriswell> Like taking an array of selected line numbers and making them into a string like '1,3,5,10-15'
[13:07:08] <grafi> hm yeah
[13:07:09] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, hmm - now I'm getting that I can't do text() on it.
[13:07:22] <grafi> its kind of neat as its going to be in the url
[13:07:37] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, got it
[13:07:43] <NewYorkSummer> duch_kazatel, didn't put it in $()
[13:07:45] <grafi> 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 doesnt really look good compared to 13-20
[13:07:58] <duch_kazatel> ah
[13:08:08] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Tr.
[13:08:10] <BillCriswell> True*
[13:08:18] <grafi> also now that i got it to fucking work
[13:08:19] <grafi> :P
[13:08:19] <BillCriswell> Wondering if the complexity is worth it though.
[13:08:23] <grafi> might as well keep it
[13:08:39] <grafi> not sure how much you could simplify it though
[13:09:09] <grafi> maybe i play a little code golf once its working
[13:09:10] <grafi> :P
[13:09:11] <BillCriswell> Github only seems to allow you to highlight a section at a time.
[13:09:26] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/Makefile#L12-L24
[13:10:16] <grafi> funnily enough shift works there too ^^
[13:10:29] <grafi> cant believe i didnt think of that myself -.-
[13:10:51] <BillCriswell> Well, you're probably not as fat as I am.
[13:11:30] <grafi> ima try to merge yours into mine
[13:11:38] <grafi> :P
[13:13:17] <BillCriswell> Godspeed!
[13:13:46] <ahandy> hey guys, i want a plugin that will allow me to trigger a function when the user slides left on a mobile to slide the second page in.. however please note that i want it to NOT disable vertical scrolling, and also to not mess up the click events on the websites
[13:13:53] <Vivekananda> hey everyone I am looking at some code but did not see that kind of css constructs and jquery too and rquest help. the code is here http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/9zePE/  . what does li > ul  mean and also what does li  li  mean  ?  also what does  $("> ul" , this ) mean ? is there a comma between this and ul ?
[13:15:41] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda > means "direct child", as in "find all ULs that are direct children of LIs, but no deeper"
[13:15:56] <duch_kazatel> think .children() vs. .find()
[13:16:50] <Vivekananda> oo nice. I did not come across that in my jquery tut on codeacad.  Also what is the diff between .children() and .find() that you rae tying to make meunderstand ?
[13:17:09] <duch_kazatel> .children() goes one level.  .find() goes many.
[13:17:28] <duch_kazatel> and the > part of the selector is a CSS selector.
[13:19:46] <Vivekananda> nice and thanks duch_kazatel
[13:20:01] <Vivekananda> also since you are around I was hoping to get more insight into some stuff
[13:20:27] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[13:20:29] <grafi> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/a2JxQ/5/
[13:20:30] <grafi> :P
[13:20:33] <grafi> kind of cool
[13:20:35] <grafi> thanks
[13:20:37] <duch_kazatel> i'll try to help, though I have to leave in a while for lunch.
[13:20:49] <BillCriswell> Hahahaha crashed.
[13:21:30] <Vivekananda> 1. I want to create a menu under a menu under a menu with custom colors. The fiddle I have is what I found onlineas an example. Now what I  want is when I hover over the level 2 item the level 3 shows up as a side menu and not a dropdown
[13:21:41] <Vivekananda> but first and second level are drop downs
[13:21:47] <Vivekananda> first is the visible level
[13:21:55] <Vivekananda> second is visible after dropdown
[13:22:05] <Vivekananda> third is just visible on the side on hover
[13:22:17] <Vivekananda> I am trying to create this kind of menu
[13:22:25] <duch_kazatel> that's a CSS concern, not a jquery concern.
[13:22:34] <Vivekananda> really ?
[13:22:47] <duch_kazatel> I take it the current functionality is basically right, but instead of the 3rd level shoing below, you want it to "pop out" to the side?
[13:22:50] <Vivekananda> but the fiddle I have is a jquery one which creates the dropdowns
[13:22:54] <Vivekananda> yep
[13:23:00] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's a styling thing.
[13:23:41] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: but then  https://jqueryui.com/menu/
[13:23:54] <duch_kazatel> then use jqueryUI to do it?
[13:24:00] <Vivekananda> isnt this jquery ?
[13:24:21] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you.
[13:24:23] <grafi> BillCriswell really? :|
[13:24:27] <grafi> why the fuck
[13:24:51] <mib_mib> hi all - i'm creating a javascript that others use - however, my javascript only uses jquery selectors as well as the jquery.append() method - i would not like to have to include ALL of the jquery library (because it is much larger compared to my 1kb script) - is there some way i can  easily extract just jquery selectors and jquery .append methods from the core?
[13:25:18] <raj> does an element have to be within the viewport for getting its height/width? Or can it be "display:block" with left:-10000px?
[13:25:26] <grafi> BillCriswell http://jsbin.com/guhuy/7/
[13:25:29] <grafi> try that ._.
[13:25:35] <grafi> and tell me its jsfiddles fault
[13:26:13] <BillCriswell> grafi: http://pastie.org/pastes/8709924/text came across this for the ranges stuff.
[13:26:26] <BillCriswell> grafi: That works fine.
[13:26:35] <grafi> that looks like the stuff duch_kazatel pointed me too yesterday
[13:26:46] <grafi> that the collapse function in my code
[13:26:57] <grafi> but i also expand the stuff back to an array :P
[13:27:04] <grafi> thats the bigger portion of the code
[13:27:13] <grafi> BillCriswell alright then, fucking jsfiddle :D
[13:27:36] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda this is one of many ways to approach this problem: http://jsfiddle.net/9zePE/2/
[13:28:06] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda but no matter what, you'll want to use CSS to do this, NOT jquery, unless you want to use jqueryUI's solution.
[13:30:51] <duch_kazatel> and with that, luncjh
[13:30:53] <duch_kazatel> *lunch
[13:32:23] <BillCriswell> grafi: It's a jerk.
[13:32:35] <BillCriswell> grafi: I have much better luck getting the numbers out of that format than in: http://pastie.org/pastes/8709936/text
[13:32:41] <Velveeta> phew!
[13:32:54] <Velveeta> ok, that took longer than i expected, but i made that highlighting utility *my* way! :D
[13:32:57] <Velveeta> http://jsbin.com/cusut/2
[13:33:17] <grafi> oh man
[13:33:21] <Velveeta> so click selected single lines at a time, the user can click-drag to highlight lines, or they can shift-click-drag to select multiple lines
[13:33:33] <Velveeta> and without crashing chrome, which is the part that took me the longest to figure out :D
[13:33:49] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: This isn't working for me?
[13:33:54] <BillCriswell> I Wonder if my computer is broke.
[13:33:56] <grafi> its working for me
[13:34:02] <Velveeta> damnit bill
[13:34:08] <BillCriswell> Are you guys on windows?
[13:34:10] <grafi> i think i like the bill+grafi merge better though
[13:34:13] <grafi> im on windows
[13:34:13] <Velveeta> if i had a nickel for everytime i'd uttered the words "damnit bill"...
[13:34:17] <Velveeta> i'm on a mac
[13:34:18] <grafi> :D
[13:34:21] <grafi> hahaha
[13:34:22] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ah.
[13:34:46] <grafi> pretty fancy Velveeta
[13:34:55] <grafi> i could never come up with code like that
[13:34:55] <BillCriswell> If I shift and try to click a different line it just blinks at me.
[13:35:02] <grafi> you have to drag BillCriswell
[13:35:10] <grafi> its a slightly different mechanic than ours
[13:35:12] <Velveeta> that's why they call me fancypants
[13:35:20] <Velveeta> that and the fact that all my pants are bedazzled
[13:35:40] <BillCriswell> Still no dice.
[13:35:43] <Vivekananda> duch_lunch: thanks and also what does ul ul ul mean ? does it mean if there is a third level ul anywhere and even reapeated then apply this rule to that ?
[13:35:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Trackpad?
[13:35:58] <Velveeta> yes
[13:36:08] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[13:36:12] <BillCriswell> Chrome?
[13:36:14] <Velveeta> yep
[13:36:28] <BillCriswell> Either I'm stupid or my computer is an asshole.
[13:36:31] <Velveeta> so, you're holding shift and then mousing-down and draggong?
[13:36:38] <Velveeta> or are you holding shift and clicking, and then dragging?
[13:36:47] <BillCriswell> I'm stupid.
[13:36:47] <Velveeta> it's a mouse-down-drag highlight
[13:37:08] <grafi> now onto combining that with the code i already have in place
[13:37:15] <grafi> its a wonderful world
[13:37:26] <BillCriswell> Should I be able to unselect this stuff with shift drag?
[13:37:33] <grafi> you should
[13:37:40] <grafi> but you cant
[13:37:41] <grafi> :D
[13:37:51] <grafi> Velveeta didnt code according to non existent spec
[13:37:51] <grafi> :D
[13:37:51] <Velveeta> sure you can, if you drag past it and backtrack
[13:38:11] <Velveeta> dragging in one direction should always highlight in that direction, even going over previously highlighted items
[13:38:19] <grafi> oh man
[13:38:19] <Velveeta> it shouldn't unhighlight until you reverse your drag direction
[13:38:25] <grafi> that is fancy
[13:38:26] <grafi> ._.
[13:38:43] <grafi> but i would have never figured that out
[13:38:45] <grafi> by my self
[13:38:46] <grafi> ^^
[13:38:53] <grafi> reverse direction to unhighlight
[13:38:53] <grafi> ^^
[13:38:59] <Velveeta> ONE MAN.. <slaps chest> BY MYSELF.. ALL DAY.. EVERY DAY..
[13:39:14] <grafi> you guys are awesome ^^
[13:39:25] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I was trying to unselect lines be shift and clicking again.
[13:39:43] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/cQeKCUL.jpg
[13:40:01] <grafi> you started it
[13:40:02] <grafi> its ON
[13:40:07] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I was looknig at your exmaple to learn a bit and could you tell me what e means in s function(e) ?
[13:40:12] <Velveeta> you know why i'm good at this stuff? cuz i eat my wheaties
[13:40:31] <Velveeta> vivekananda: it's the event object that jquery passes to the callback that's handling it
[13:40:38] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/xowDjmB.gif
[13:40:50] <Velveeta> the first parameter to any jquery event listener is always the event object for that event
[13:41:07] <Vivekananda> in the present context what is this object ? it is not created anywhere so I am confused
[13:41:08] <Velveeta> grafi: i've seen this movie, it was called hugo
[13:41:21] <grafi> hugo
[13:41:22] <grafi> oô
[13:41:54] <Velveeta> vivekananda: it's created in the bowels of jquery… it attaches its own event listeners to the browser, and then piggybacks on them, creates a normalized event object across all browsers, and dispatches that event object to the listener
[13:42:11] <Vivekananda> bowels!!! indeed :) lol
[13:42:24] <Velveeta> that way you write your code to comply with the interface of jquery's event object, and it doesn't matter if it's being executed in IE, FF, chrome, whatever, you get the same event object interface
[13:44:03] <Vivekananda> I got part of it but what is this event object in your code ? ie which event ? eg on on line... shoot you dont have line nos :(.  in the line View.ul   .on('mousedown.highlight', 'li', function (e)    is mouse.highlight the event ?
[13:44:47] <Velveeta> mousedown is the event itself
[13:45:02] <Velveeta> the .highlight is a namespace to isolate that mousedown listener from any other potential mousedown event listeners
[13:45:18] <Velveeta> that way when i unbind event listeners later on, i can unbind them by namespace and only clean up my own and not everybody else's
[13:46:16] <Velveeta> one of my coworkers was reading an article from javascript weekly about "which framework is best for you: angular, ember, or backbone?" and said it was crap and wondered how it got into the digest for this week
[13:46:38] <Velveeta> and then another coworker said it was like a cosmo quiz: "Angular is mysterious, but kind of aloof, while Backbone is always there to support you."
[13:46:54] <Velveeta> and then coworker 1 said "backbone always gets friendzoned, better to be angular"
[13:47:14] <Velveeta> and then i said "angular is the kid with parkinson's that the football team lets onto the field in the final 5 seconds and watches the defense play grabass while he slowly staggers his way into the endzone, so that they only lose by 47 points instead of 54.. but it's got such a big heart"
[13:48:07] <NewYorkSummer> How can I change the text input in an input box via jQuery?
[13:48:31] <Velveeta> newyorksummer: change the text *in* the input? or change the actual input type?
[13:48:44] <NewYorkSummer> Velveeta, text in input
[13:48:49] <Velveeta> use .val()
[13:48:55] <Velveeta> yourInput.val('some new value')
[13:51:13] <Velveeta> vivekananda: did i explain that sufficiently?
[13:56:59] <BillCriswell> grafi: You're awesome1
[13:57:07] <grafi> i know
[13:57:08] <grafi> :D
[13:57:12] <BillCriswell> I'm going to eat... maybe 7 cheese burgers tonight.
[13:57:45] <grafi> :O
[13:57:50] <grafi> real cheeseburgers
[13:57:55] <Velveeta> now *that's* awesome
[13:57:57] <grafi> or mcdonalds cheeseburgers
[13:58:13] <Velveeta> mcdonalds are smaller, so 7 is a more realistic goal there
[13:58:21] <grafi> yeah
[13:58:24] <grafi> also they suck
[13:58:25] <grafi> :P
[13:58:33] <grafi> i once ate a fucking monster of a burger
[13:58:35] <grafi> it was awesome
[14:02:16] <Velveeta> the biggest burger i've ever had was a 2 lb one, which was the smallest one on the menu at this place
[14:02:24] <Velveeta> and i got through half of it and then gave up
[14:02:48] <Velveeta> and after about the first bite or 2, there was so much grease seaping into the buns that they started dissolving in my hands and i had to just put it down and take a knife and fork to it
[14:02:53] <Velveeta> it was glorious……..
[14:06:22] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Hhahaha.
[14:06:28] <BillCriswell> I doubt I'll hit 7 burgers.
[14:06:33] <BillCriswell> I'm not Randy Bo Bandy.
[14:06:56] <Velveeta> and i'm not……. steven.. bo beven!
[14:07:23] <Velveeta> thanks google, for helping me define randy bobandy
[14:07:35] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Trailer Park Boys character.
[14:07:51] <Velveeta> gotcha, the only ones i was familiar with were ricky and bubbles :D
[14:07:52] <BillCriswell> Keeps a couple cases in a freezer at all time.
[14:08:10] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: parts of did make sense although a new question is about what a namespace is and where it is used. I have heard it spoken for languages but not very clear of its meaning
[14:08:29] <BillCriswell> I watch that show entirely too much.
[14:08:39] <Velveeta> so, a namespace is typically just a method of organizing batches of related code
[14:09:17] <Velveeta> so, for example, if you look at a traditional language like java or c# or something, their functions are grouped into namespaces, which themselves are grouped into namespaces, like categories
[14:09:29] <Velveeta> so you have the System namespace, System.IO, etc
[14:09:48] <Velveeta> and under those, you'll find functions that are related to system I/O-type things
[14:09:50] <BillCriswell> Real nerd shit is what he's saying.
[14:10:03] <Velveeta> within the context of that code, namespaces are a way of grouping those related event listeners
[14:10:25] <Velveeta> so since they were all related to that highlighting functionality, i put a .highlight onto each one to denote that they were of the highlight namespace
[14:10:43] <Velveeta> and then when i called .off, i could have said View.lis.off('mouseenter')
[14:11:02] <Velveeta> but if i did that, and anybody else had a mouseenter listener bound to those li's, it would have been removed also, which wasn't my intent
[14:11:23] <Velveeta> i only wanted to remove my own, so i passed the namespace ".highlight" to the off function, which just told it "remove every event listener in this namespace"
[14:12:07] <Velveeta> you can assign event listeners to multiple namespaces too, and reference them, like "click.namespace1.namespace2"
[14:12:38] <Velveeta> and then you could do myElement.trigger('click'), which would fire that callback, or myElement.trigger('click.namespace1') which would also, or 'click.namespace2', or 'click.namespace1.namespace2'
[14:13:05] <Velveeta> and the more specific you make those events you're triggering, the more you can exclude other events and focus solely on your own
[14:13:31] <Velveeta> so if i had a 'click' listener on an element, and a 'click.namespace1' element, if i did .trigger('click'), it would trigger both of those listener callbacks
[14:13:53] <Velveeta> but if i did .trigger('click.namespace1') it would only trigger the 1 listener, and leave the generic 'click' listener unfired
[14:14:28] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I understood the part about why you used and also how it is used in the present context. I am trying to grasp how the usage of it will bein say like Java. Where and how will I use a namespace ? As far as I know I already have objects and I can pretty much do anything with that object without affecting the others
[14:15:11] <Velveeta> right, but that's for objects, you can treat javascript objects as namespaces for functions themselves
[14:15:20] <Velveeta> but the namespaces here are referring to events vs functions
[14:15:43] <Velveeta> so you can namespace your events so that calling an event by its fully-qualified name + namespace will *only* trigger a specific listener
[14:16:15] <Velveeta> if i trigger('mouseup.highlight') programmatically, it won't trigger any other 'mouseup' listeners, only those that are listening to the mouseup event in the highlight namespace
[14:16:45] <Vivekananda> yep I understand that :).
[14:17:12] <Velveeta> ok, then am i dancing around some other question that i'm not seeing? :)
[14:17:20] <Velveeta> or was that the answer you were looking for?
[14:26:35] <BillCriswell> grafi: http://jsbin.com/guhuy/6/edit I think this is the most like Gmails behavoir wise.
[14:27:06] <BillCriswell> Er. Maybe not.

[14:27:24] <grafi> for me at least
[14:27:24] <grafi> :P
[14:28:13] <Velveeta> it just insulted my mother!
[14:28:20] <Velveeta> what's your angle, billcriswell?!
[14:28:28] <BillCriswell> Trying to figure out when to unselect or select the range
[14:29:07] <BillCriswell> I think it always just checks the range unless they are all checked.
[14:29:11] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I have no idea.
[14:30:59] <Velveeta> now when i clicked on something, it made a farty sound at me!
[14:31:12] <grafi> lol
[14:31:13] <Velveeta> this is the worst code ever written

[14:48:32] <blue_warlock> i got the button repeat to infinite
[15:08:22] <asido> how to perform functions calls like addClass() and such on array of elements instead of 1 DOM?
[15:08:37] <asido> I mean, what's the best approach in JS? I know I can always have a for loop
[15:08:55] <asido> but that's a bit verbose. is there anything like C# LINQ?
[15:11:24] <greppy> I'm trying to submit two forms as one by serializing both forms and sending them as a post, only one form worth of data is seen on the server, but the console.log shows both being sent.  nginx + php-fpm : code : http://lab.technomage.net/index.php
[15:11:59] <Velveeta> asido: jquery will internally loop through all the items in a collection for you
[15:12:16] <Velveeta> if you have 30 div's on a page and want to add the 'foo' class to them all, just do $('div').addClass('foo')
[15:12:32] <asido> Velveeta, even in `arr.find(".someclass").children().remove()` ?
[15:13:08] <Velveeta> well, that's not an addClass call, so i'm not sure which segment of that you're wanting to use for your collection, but yes, that's the idea
[15:13:22] <Velveeta> the functions are chainable and apply to the entire collection typically, not just 1 node
[15:44:24] <bradix14> Somehow jquery just turned most of my hrefs to # when the page renders.  Any ideas?  I can't think of anything I changed, but all of the sudden my buttons don't work
[15:50:47] <mdev> so
[15:50:54] <mdev> live works on doesn't
[15:51:07] <mdev> I guess i'm using an older jquery version btu what happens if i use the latest
[15:51:15] <mdev> is it going to break all IE stuff?
[15:51:52] <Velveeta> if you use the 2.x branch, it doesn't have support for legacy IE anymore
[15:52:03] <Velveeta> if you continue using the 1.x branch, you should be fine
[15:52:22] <mdev> that really sucks
[15:52:44] <mdev> whoever made that decision needs to be superceded IMHO by someone that understands marketshare and web design
[15:52:49] <Velveeta> bradix14: i've never seen anything like that, have you tried removing jquery from your page load and seeing if the href's revert to their normal state?
[15:52:57] <Velveeta> uhhh.. no
[15:53:01] <Velveeta> they're keeping them in feature parity
[15:53:15] <Velveeta> they specifically made that move to trim the fat from jquery going forward on the 2.x branch
[15:53:29] <mdev> yeah and leaving IE behind?
[15:53:31] <Velveeta> but they allowed for legacy support in the 1.x branch, with the same feature set
[15:53:43] <mdev> having two seperate jquery versions...idk even how to integrate that safely
[15:53:47] <bradix14> it's a web app I'm building in jQuery Mobile and WordPress... If I turn off jquery, then nothing loads
[15:54:00] <Velveeta> mdev: why would you need to integrate 2 separate jquery versions?
[15:54:14] <Oog> where can i look up docs on $("#new_smtp_account").on("ajax:success",
[15:54:16] <mdev> oh so they're still working on 1.x not simply abandoning it(yet) ok that's good then
[15:54:19] <mdev> i'm the dumbs
[15:54:20] <Velveeta> right
[15:54:35] <Velveeta> the 1.1x version #'s correspond to the 2.x #'s
[15:54:42] <Oog> it seems for any element you can bind ajax:success ?
[15:54:45] <Velveeta> so 1.10 is 2.0 + legacy IE support
[15:54:51] <Velveeta> 1.11 is 2.1 + legacy IE support, etc
[15:54:56] <Velveeta> current releases are 1.11 and 2.1
[15:55:21] <mdev> Velveeta alright sorry for my mini rant then, whoever runs jquery knows what they're doing clearly, I just hope the 1.x support continues at least until old ie's are very rare
[15:55:42] <Velveeta> yeah i don't think they have any plans on abandoning legacy IE in the near future
[15:55:54] <Velveeta> i would think that by 2017, though, they'll be thinking about it
[15:55:57] <tw2113> i hope more people just ditch old IE and the people stuck on them
[15:56:04] <Velveeta> dropping support for IE 7/8 at least
[15:56:31] <Velveeta> we're looking to ditch IE7 as of Q2 in some of our products, MS end-of-lifing the support for XP makes that argument a lot easier to make
[15:56:34] <mdev> yeah IE is only browser that has a major features on my site broken, and it's always the browser giving me trouble
[15:56:41] <mdev> but sadly users use it so...
[15:56:42] <Velveeta> oog: i don't know that ajax:success works anymore
[15:56:55] <Oog> yeah i though this might be old...
[15:57:02] <Oog> so what should i look at
[15:57:06] <Oog> whats the correct way to do this
[15:57:31] <Oog> this code is doing $("#new_smtp_account").on("ajax:success", function(e, data, status, xhr) {}).bind("ajax:error", ...)
[15:58:12] <mdev> it'd help if microsoft didn't browser lock their latest IE versions to their latest windows, but whatever, hopefully more and more convert to other browsers, I read one site where IE's marketshare has plummeted but not sure how accurate
[15:58:18] <Velveeta> oog: does that element need to be notified of every single time there's any ajax start/end on the page?
[15:58:42] <Velveeta> it's plummeted, yes, but it's still pretty significant
[15:59:10] <Velveeta> i read an article that said in a few years, people will be supporting 72 different versions of IE :D
[15:59:13] <Oog> no just when that form is posted
[15:59:14] <Oog> <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/smtp_accounts" class="new_smtp_account" data-remote="true" id="new_smtp_account" method="post" role="form">
[15:59:32] <Velveeta> http://www.paulirish.com/2011/browser-market-pollution-iex-is-the-new-ie6/
[16:00:12] <Velveeta> oog: then you should add your listener just when that form's ajax is shipped… $.ajax (and derivative functions) return a promise object that you can bind callback listeners to
[16:00:52] <Oog> so ajax:success is a global hook?
[16:01:35] <mdev> maybe new microsoft ceo will remove the os lock on IE and do auto updates to latest and greatest like chrome and firefox do
[16:01:37] <Velveeta> yepyep, at least, i think it *was*
[16:01:55] <tw2113> i'm still waiting for them to officially drop xp
[16:01:55] <mdev> they could overnight improve the web for millions of devs if they did that
[16:01:57] <Velveeta> mdev: as of IE10 i believe, IE went to evergreen mode with the right options set
[16:02:03] <Velveeta> i know it's evergreen as of 11
[16:02:14] <Velveeta> but you can still disable that functionality if you're an ass-hat system admin
[16:02:22] <mdev> tw2113 they can't, too many use XP think I read tons of banks use it and so does china
[16:02:33] <Velveeta> they're dropping support for XP in a couple months
[16:02:45] <mdev> they been saying that for years
[16:02:49] <Velveeta> http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx
[16:02:54] <mdev> think they extended it again
[16:03:48] <Velveeta> and hopefully when all of these outdated systems get upgrades to be back into a valid support environment, they don't just upgrade to vista, but rather roll up to win7 or 8.x, and take a big-boy version of IE
[16:03:51] <Oog> Velveeta: wait i see... its a rails thing https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/ajax
[16:04:08] <Oog> that is why i couldnt find it in jquery docs
[16:04:09] <Velveeta> a lot of the thing that keeps legacy IE around is all the idiots that wrong internal web apps that were IE-specific
[16:04:10] <greppy> mdev, they extended ms security essentials updates for xp, which isn't quite the same as extending support for it :)
[16:04:17] <mdev> well
[16:04:18] <Velveeta> and they brake if you try to access them in a modern browser
[16:04:28] <mdev> I think they'll still offer updates for those that pay(like banks)
[16:04:37] <Velveeta> oog: ahhhh gotcha
[16:04:57] <Velveeta> oog: so yeah, now, when you make your $.ajax request, you can chain off of it in a promise fashion, to attach your callbacks for success/failure
[16:05:17] <Velveeta> $.ajax(options).done(successCallback).fail(errorCallback).always(completeCallback)
[16:05:23] <mdev> XP is a good os, they should support it another year IMHO, I believe every top browser runs on it just fine
[16:05:31] <mdev> except IE
[16:05:33] <tw2113> i want them to drop XP completely
[16:05:38] <mdev> why?
[16:05:52] <Velveeta> XP was a good OS, but i don't see why they need to support it any longer, it's over a decade since the original launch
[16:06:01] <tw2113> because it's an 11 year old OS?
[16:06:17] <mdev> xp ipv6 isn't that great but ipv6 isn't really adopted heavily yet, and the next step up is vista which is awful, then you have win7 but need a computer capable of running it
[16:06:21] <tw2113> it's also only Microsoft's fault that they didn't let 9-11 work on XP
[16:06:21] <Oog> thanks
[16:06:25] <Velveeta> and if you don't drop support for things that old, you'll end up hindering feature dev in other product lines
[16:06:48] <tw2113> everyone else has their latest supported on it
[16:07:31] <mdev> I don't think vista/win7 really have features that xp doesn't, that I can think of
[16:07:56] <Velveeta> aero theme!
[16:07:58] <Velveeta> :D
[16:08:16] <mdev> yeah that's true heh, and they brought it back in 8.1 I think, it's taken out in 8.0
[16:08:32] <tw2113> if only everyone used a real OS like any of the linux distros
[16:08:41] <Velveeta> said the neckbeard
[16:09:01] <grafi> Velveeta congratulate me, its bloddy working :D
[16:09:02] <tw2113> real men have well warmed necks
[16:09:08] <Velveeta> grafi: huzzah!
[16:09:12] <Velveeta> tw2113: lol
[16:09:13] <grafi> exactly
[16:09:14] <grafi> :P
[16:09:28] <mdev> I like linux for server, I like it a lot
[16:09:42] <Velveeta> and i like having a true shell in this company mac
[16:09:45] <systemfault> OSX FTW
[16:09:51] <Velveeta> vs the cygwyn crap in windows
[16:10:01] <grafi> turns out this is the optimal way to prevent user selection stuff
[16:10:03] <grafi>             $(document).mousedown(function (e) {
[16:10:03] <grafi>                 if (e.shiftKey) e.preventDefault();
[16:10:03] <grafi>             });
[16:10:04] <grafi> ^^
[16:10:09] <grafi> sorry for tabs
[16:10:10] <grafi> :x
[16:10:20] <grafi> not sorry
[16:10:28] <systemfault> grafi: The optimal is using the user-select CSS property ;)
[16:10:28] <mdev> lol
[16:10:30] <tw2113> i shouldn't talk too much about outdated OSes, I'm still on Fedora 16
[16:10:43] <grafi> systemfault not in this case systemfault :P
[16:10:48] <grafi> or im not smart enough
[16:10:50] <grafi> :D
[16:10:58] <Velveeta> i remember installing FC3 back in my network admin days.. the height of redhat technologies
[16:11:02] <tw2113> so I haven't updated my desktop since late 2011
[16:11:20] <grafi> tw2113 shame on you twisted`
[16:11:23] <mdev> i'm a debian based distros fan :) namely ubuntu
[16:11:24] <grafi> what
[16:11:25] <grafi> lol
[16:11:26] <grafi> :D
[16:11:31] <mdev> fights with me less, easy to use on the server
[16:11:39] <grafi> crunchbang
[16:11:41] <grafi> <.
[16:12:04] <systemfault> For frontend work.. You can't have better than OSX.
[16:12:12] <tw2113> I apparently couldn't bring myself to upgrade to "Beefy Miracle"
[16:12:12] <Velveeta> i add a comment to the kernel of every distro i run, just so i can claim it's a custom release you've probably never heard of
[16:12:14] <systemfault> For backend programming, I prefer Linux
[16:12:25] <mdev> I disagree, windows has tons of awesome software by third party
[16:12:34] <mdev> for instance notepad++ a free app windows only is golden
[16:12:43] <mdev> I use it for all dev work, is awesome
[16:12:46] <Velveeta> i have to use a mac for my day job, because as a front end dev, i have to test on mac browsers also
[16:13:02] <Velveeta> and while i can run windows in a VM to test those browsers, i can't do the opposite because it violates the apple eula
[16:13:06] <mdev> safari stopped releasing safari versions for windows in 2012 I think
[16:13:09] <mdev> kind of annoying
[16:13:14] <mdev> *Apple rather
[16:13:22] <grafi> Velveeta what about browserstack or something ^^
[16:13:27] <mdev> they also don't allow firefox on iphone/ipad
[16:13:35] <Velveeta> not nearly as easy as just launching the browser
[16:13:50] <Velveeta> plus, i like the aluminum cases, strong and light
[16:13:51] <grafi> OH MY FUCKING GOD
[16:13:55] <tw2113> i'm moving back to android because of Firefox stuff on ios
[16:13:56] <Velveeta> but damn do these things get hot
[16:13:57] <grafi> AUSTRALIS EVERYWHERE
[16:13:59] <grafi> ._.
[16:14:03] <grafi> shouldnt have updated
[16:14:10] <Velveeta> i got my new macbook from work just yesterday :D
[16:14:18] <Velveeta> 8-core w/ 16 gigs of ram and a 512gig SSD
[16:14:22] <systemfault> Nice
[16:14:23] <mdev> for $2000
[16:14:23] <grafi> Velveeta send it to me
[16:14:24] <mdev> haha
[16:14:25] <Velveeta> definitely
[16:14:27] <tw2113> best Fedora release name came from Fedora 19: "Schr?dinger's Cat"
[16:14:28] <grafi> i have to have it
[16:14:40] <Velveeta> ok, gotta go afk for a bit
[16:15:08] <systemfault> tw2113: Will it work and crash at the same time?
[16:15:17] <tw2113> dunno yet
[16:15:22] <systemfault> Hmm.. you'll never know until you boot it.. :/
[16:16:21] <tw2113> i'd still end up doing fluxbox on top of gnome
[16:16:24] <FriendlySeal> helo frenz
[16:16:37] <FriendlySeal> can sum1 refresh me
[16:16:37] <mdev> flux too plain for me, I don't run linux as desktop though
[16:16:40] <tw2113> who's frenz?
[16:16:42] <systemfault> I'm a KDEtard
[16:16:44] <mdev> I think xfce is really nice
[16:16:51] <FriendlySeal> when extending
[16:16:53] <mdev> lxde is super for lower powered machines
[16:16:58] <FriendlySeal> _var vs var
[16:16:58] <systemfault> But if I had to use something really light, I'd use openbox
[16:17:16] <FriendlySeal> which one is _var_
[16:17:18] <FriendlySeal> and which is var
[16:17:29] <systemfault> FriendlySeal: What are you talking about?
[16:17:51] <FriendlySeal> when extending is _var_ the overriden one
[16:17:57] <FriendlySeal> or the parent one
[16:18:24] <FriendlySeal> right now _var_ is the extending one
[16:18:35] <systemfault> How do you extend?
[16:18:46] <FriendlySeal> wow
[16:18:48] <FriendlySeal> easy?
[16:18:59] <FriendlySeal> lol.extend({ return blah
[16:19:23] <systemfault> I didn't know .extend messed with variable names.
[16:19:33] <systemfault> Does it?
[16:19:37] <FriendlySeal> no im seting it
[16:19:50] <FriendlySeal> so i jsut have a default template
[16:20:00] <FriendlySeal> and a template i choose to extend with
[16:20:10] <FriendlySeal> so its template and _template
[16:20:46] <FriendlySeal> _ is the extended one
[16:21:03] <FriendlySeal> i gues dun mater lol
[16:21:26] <systemfault> It's not class based OOP... think of it as mixins
[16:21:34] <systemfault> $.extend(target, obj1, obj2......)
[16:21:38] <FriendlySeal> omfg dood
[16:21:41] <FriendlySeal> r u high
[16:21:43] <tw2113> i still hope FriendlySeal uses jshint/lint a lot
[16:21:50] <FriendlySeal> im talking about convention
[16:21:57] <FriendlySeal> not code
[16:22:04] <FriendlySeal> like c++ standards
[16:22:28] <FriendlySeal> forget it
[16:22:31] <FriendlySeal> u dunno
[16:22:36] <systemfault> Right.
[16:22:49] <FriendlySeal> ill jus leave it how i have it alrady
[16:25:05] <FriendlySeal> all u gaize shud look at this cool page
[16:25:06] <FriendlySeal> http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html
[16:25:32] <systemfault> FriendlySeal: AFAIK, C++ and JS don't have coding standards...
[16:25:51] <systemfault> If you really care, Java has an official one.
[16:25:52] <FriendlySeal> ya but its more fun to use them
[16:25:58] <FriendlySeal> oh fuk no
[16:26:12] <FriendlySeal> java sux so bad
[16:26:16] <systemfault> FriendlySeal: If you want one... look at the one from google
[16:26:21] <tw2113> TLDR;
[16:26:24] <FriendlySeal> no standard can help it
[16:26:26] <systemfault> https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
[16:26:36] <FriendlySeal> also fuk google
[16:26:44] <FriendlySeal> c++ is older than google
[16:26:56] <FriendlySeal> google jus think they fkn pwn but they dont
[16:26:59] <systemfault> That's a JS style guide BTW...
[16:27:13] <FriendlySeal> google needs to relax
[16:27:18] <tw2113> they have chrome users brainwashed :D
[16:27:33] <FriendlySeal> im sick of them making every app possible
[16:27:39] <FriendlySeal> its just jstfu google
[16:27:50] <systemfault> Well, if it wasn't of chrome... we'd probably have firefox 3.141592 by now.
[16:28:01] <FriendlySeal> stop hiring every indian alive and going crazy coding up random shit
[16:28:23] <FriendlySeal> take a break
[16:28:36] <FriendlySeal> lol they have and free food too
[16:28:42] <FriendlySeal> fkn bastards
[16:28:52] <systemfault> FriendlySeal: Lots of frustration inside your heart, man...
[16:28:53] <FriendlySeal> pos company
[16:29:03] <FriendlySeal> i have 2 friends that work there tho
[16:29:07] <FriendlySeal> lol
[16:29:28] <tw2113> lots of frustration, missing letters from the words he types
[16:29:31] <FriendlySeal> and another friend jus moved to SF
[16:29:44] <FriendlySeal> sorry we cant all live in SF
[16:29:51] <FriendlySeal> so fuk u SF
[16:30:09] <FriendlySeal> and i hate the golden gate brige so fuk that brige
[16:30:11] <systemfault> FriendlySeal: So... basically, fuck everything you can't have/get, right?
[16:30:47] <FriendlySeal> they are idiots
[16:30:53] <FriendlySeal> wat can i say
[16:31:08] <tw2113> lots of liberals out that way too...hmm
[16:31:17] <tw2113> *runs*
[16:31:20] <systemfault> haha
[16:31:26] <Vivekananda> I am trying to find a way that when I click inside a search box it animates into a div with specified dimensions and with a search box in the top middle. I am reading jquery animate() but not sure if that can do it
[16:32:01] <FriendlySeal> i think google is the goverment
[16:32:10] <FriendlySeal> member yahoo
[16:32:13] <FriendlySeal> how shity it was
[16:32:28] <FriendlySeal> then google appeared and it was every shittier
[16:32:40] <FriendlySeal> then all of a sudden boom
[16:32:42] <systemfault> Google was awesome back in the days.
[16:32:45] <FriendlySeal> google is giant
[16:32:52] <FriendlySeal> same w facebook
[16:33:13] <FriendlySeal> these companies appeared from nowhere and somehow they instantly had trillions of dollars
[16:33:40] <FriendlySeal> not even microsoft grew that fast
[16:35:01] <Vivekananda> so f*** microsoft :)
[16:35:06] <Vivekananda> lol
[16:35:13] <FriendlySeal> ms is ok
[16:35:14] <Siecje> how do you check if a name attribute contains a substring
[16:35:19] <FriendlySeal> i used it when i was yonger
[16:35:36] <FriendlySeal> id look silly if i used it now
[16:36:09] <FriendlySeal> Siecje, contains a string
[16:36:15] <FriendlySeal> substring is a function
[16:36:36] <systemfault> Siecje: myNode.attr('name').indexOf('mysubstring') !== -1 ?
[16:36:39] <FriendlySeal> $(".lol").attr("name");
[16:37:41] <Oog> should i use submit.text("new text") or submit.prop("value", "new text") - does it matter?
[16:38:53] <systemfault> Oog: What is "submit"?
[16:39:04] <Oog> an <input type='submit'>
[16:39:23] <systemfault> Oog: Then you probably want submit.val('new text')
[16:39:33] <Oog> ok thanks
[16:40:02] <Vivekananda> FriendlySeal: it has done nothing but fed off from competition and undue advantage and monopolizing
[16:40:18] <Vivekananda> now someone else is doing it
[16:41:26] <Vivekananda> anyone with any suggestions for me
[16:43:39] <Siecje> systemfault: I want to find all nodes with that have a string in their name
[16:45:08] <Velveeta> vivekananda: animate in what way?
[16:47:57] <systemfault> Siecje: Ah, then $('[name*="lol"]')
[16:53:18] <FriendlySeal> those r my fav selectors so far
[16:53:36] <FriendlySeal> i use name^="lol"
[16:57:40] <FriendlySeal> waaaaaaaaaaahahahaa
[16:57:51] <FriendlySeal> i got grid / list views
[16:58:00] <FriendlySeal> weeeeeeeepeepeee
[16:58:17] <FriendlySeal> runtime rendering
[17:00:40] <zumba_addict> hey folks, i have a hunch that using if xhr.status == 200 is not enough. It's because I'm getting duplicate POST. How can we be sure that server has really complete processing our request? Here is my code, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/edc41c94a4fbb123b5da
[17:01:28] <Velveeta> zumba_addict: why not use jquery's ajax function and let it handle those details for you?
[17:01:33] <Vivekananda> oo Velveeta you are around nice :). so here is what I am trying to do
[17:01:55] <Velveeta> vivekananda: for a little bit, possibly headed out somewhere w/ the wife
[17:02:06] <zumba_addict> It's BackboneJS but I was thinking that BackboneJS uses jquery for the ajax request
[17:02:51] <Vivekananda> I have a simple text search box and is an autocomplete widget too. Now what I want is when I click in the box it morphs into a div which gets the widget which i sa part of a bid div which has empty place in it
[17:03:07] <Velveeta> zumba_addict: yes it does, so you should be able to use $.ajax specifically, or backbone's fetch method returns the xhr from the underlying ajax request
[17:03:16] <Velveeta> so you can just chain your callbacks off of its promise return
[17:03:24] <zumba_addict> k
[17:03:36] <zumba_addict> way over my head :D
[17:03:40] <Velveeta> yourBackboneModel.fetch().done(successCallback)
[17:04:03] <zumba_addict> i use model.save.success
[17:04:40] <zumba_addict> looks like I didn't include the gist code
[17:04:49] <Velveeta> so why are you mucking with the raw xhr status codes rather than letting those things execute your callbacks?
[17:05:28] <zumba_addict> this is it, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5f4935acc322116e63ab
[17:05:57] <zumba_addict> so checking xhr.status is not a good idea?
[17:06:12] <Vivekananda> my question makes any sense ?
[17:06:18] <Velveeta> well, in this case, since you're supplying the same callback for both error and success, you would have to
[17:06:29] <Velveeta> vivekananda: sorry, i totally missed it, gimme a sec and i'll scroll back
[17:06:38] <zumba_addict> I have an IF there
[17:06:41] <Velveeta> zumba_addict: you should split those code chunks out into separate functions
[17:06:48] <zumba_addict> will do
[17:06:50] <Velveeta> and just use 1 for your error property and the other for success
[17:06:59] <zumba_addict> is it bad if I was doing that?
[17:07:01] <Velveeta> and then you don't have to check the status code
[17:07:13] <Velveeta> it's not *bad* per se, but it's something unnecessary
[17:07:20] <Velveeta> because jquery is doing those checks for you already
[17:07:21] <zumba_addict> I got it
[17:07:41] <zumba_addict> so is success callback enough to assume that server completed our request?
[17:07:56] <zumba_addict> it's because I;m getting duplicate POST
[17:08:02] <zumba_addict> it's intermittent
[17:08:08] <Velveeta> vivekananda: so it 'morphs' into this div, but what kind of animation are you wanting for that? like, stretching vertically/horizontally? fading in, or what?
[17:08:12] <zumba_addict> sometimes it's good, sometimes it does double POST
[17:08:16] <Velveeta> zumba_addict: yep
[17:08:25] <FriendlySeal> zumba_addict, ummm
[17:08:29] <zumba_addict> i'll separate it now and see if it will make a difference
[17:08:32] <FriendlySeal> u need to break that dbl post
[17:08:45] <FriendlySeal> disable the btn
[17:08:50] <FriendlySeal> onclick
[17:09:06] <zumba_addict> no, I don't think it's btn issue
[17:09:17] <FriendlySeal> dun be sily
[17:09:29] <zumba_addict> tell me more
[17:09:38] <FriendlySeal> well lets continie
[17:10:21] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I want it to slowly transform into the div and on clicking outside just come back to its smal box shape
[17:10:32] <Vivekananda> now the div will have lots of things along with the search box
[17:10:49] <Vivekananda> I looked up animate () but dont think that wil do this for me
[17:12:40] <zumba_addict> Velveeta: I create a new success callback. I'll retest my application now
[17:13:07] <Vivekananda> I should try creating a fiddle
[17:13:30] <Velveeta> you should be storing off the xhr from your post also, so that if it's already pending, you can stop a 2nd one from posting, and then null it out in your complete handler
[17:14:16] <FriendlySeal> o wtf
[17:14:28] <FriendlySeal> see this is why u cant trust computers
[17:16:33] <Velveeta> vivekananda: also, i'm about to have to take off for now, i'll be back later, and if you still need help with this issue, i'll need more details about how exactly you want it to animate
[17:17:04] <Velveeta> you can possibly do it w/ a css transform/transition, depending on your browser support matrix, or else w/ a js animation
[17:17:19] <Velveeta> but i'll need details of *how* you want it to actually animate to tell you what your possibilities are
[17:19:53] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I dont have any specifics
[17:20:16] <Vivekananda> I just  want it to increase in size and change into the div
[17:20:18] <Velveeta> well, think about it for a while
[17:20:31] <Velveeta> i'll be back, but it'll probably be at least an hour, maybe 2
[17:20:34] <Vivekananda> and fill up the space in between on the pag
[17:20:35] <Vivekananda> ok

[18:31:28] <systemfault> 2.0 isn't about technology
[18:31:33] <Velveeta> 2.0 never had a formal definition, everybody thought it meant something different, some people said ajax, some said user-driven content, some said other shit
[18:31:45] <Velveeta> that's why it's a pointless term
[18:31:49] <systemfault> 2.0 is the "social web", user-driven content

[18:47:55] <FriendlySeal> i dont have to pay to see a ferari drive by

[19:10:42] <Velveeta> introspectr5: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/VBAP6/2/
[19:10:56] <superphly> it's really not that bad
[19:10:58] <Velveeta> you can delegate the event listeners to the table, and store the email once as a data property on the row
[19:11:32] <Velveeta> and then for all clicks just store a classname identifier in the anchor, seek to the closest tr for the email, and pass that to the appropriate function in your callback
[19:11:38] <superphly> tw2113: i was thinking that I would just need to return the value, but that doesn't send it back to that :7 append
[19:11:50] <Velveeta> and then you can insert any number of new rows without having to do any additional event binding
[19:12:05] <tw2113> too many appends going on
[19:12:40] <tw2113> surely that can be whittled down
[19:14:17] <Velveeta> introspectr5: here's an updated version that console.log()'s the function being called, and the email address being passed to it, so you can see that they're calling the proper functions with the proper data
[19:14:20] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/VBAP6/3/
[19:15:23] <Velveeta> actually use this one, since it throws an error before hitting the console.log, since your functions aren't defined here: http://jsfiddle.net/VBAP6/4/
[19:18:12] <introspectr5> Velveeta thank you! i'm reviewing it now
[19:18:19] <Velveeta> no problemo
[19:21:12] <grafi> boom full iron armor!!
[19:22:46] <introspectr5> Velveeta: I'm not sure I understand the i loop, why is it capped at 5? would not a counter variable be better suited?
[19:23:08] <Velveeta> oh that was just to demonstrate multiple rows in the table, since i only had 1 row worth of data in that json
[19:23:25] <Velveeta> so it just creates 5 rows w/ it and adds an _0 through _4 to each email address to differentiate them
[19:32:03] <superphly> tw2113: http://pastebin.com/1DE6b3a3
[19:32:29] <superphly> How do I get that .each result to append to the UL?
[19:35:15] <tw2113> superphly, do you have an example fo your data.leaders object that i could work with?
[19:36:06] <superphly> tw2113: how do i give it to ya? it's from a json feed, but it's kinda deep in
[19:36:12] <tw2113> pastebin?
[19:36:16] <superphly> 1 sec
[19:36:22] <Velveeta> superphly: you're using that .append() function wrong, if you're trying to pass a function to it, then you need to wrap that .each() in a function wrapper, and then return the collection from it that you want to append
[19:37:19] <superphly> Velveeta: could you elaborate? i'm really close to understanding this.
[19:37:33] <tw2113> Velveeta, why can i never seem to do something like this? var data; data.foo = 'something';
[19:37:39] <tw2113> it gives me data is undefined errors
[19:37:47] <Velveeta> because data *is* undefined :D
[19:37:48] <tw2113> am i misunderstanding properties?
[19:37:56] <Velveeta> you should do var data = {}; data.foo = 'something';
[19:38:00] <tw2113> ah
[19:38:03] <Velveeta> you want to initialize it as an object
[19:38:13] <Velveeta> superphly: sure, i'll whip up an example
[19:38:34] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/tuhuf/1/edit
[19:38:50] <tw2113> this will be good enough
[19:43:02] <Velveeta> superphly: here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/Vp5Le/1/
[19:43:17] <Velveeta> also what tw2113 said
[19:44:40] <FriendlySeal> oo i didnt kno append has callback
[19:44:47] <FriendlySeal> does html have callback?
[19:44:52] <Velveeta> i believe so
[19:45:02] <FriendlySeal> oshit
[19:45:06] <grafi> yeah html9 does
[19:45:08] <tw2113> for performance sake, don't do append/appendto inside loops
[19:45:22] <tw2113> concatenate and append once
[19:45:31] <FriendlySeal> orly
[19:45:45] <Velveeta> right, it's not *as* bad if you're operating on a document fragment, but it's still bad practice
[19:45:57] <tw2113> i imagine a cached selector isn't as bad, but still
[19:47:52] <superphly> ok, so that makes sense now.
[19:48:07] <superphly> i was hoping to do all that via chaining and not get into variable creating/passing back.
[19:48:19] <superphly> i guess it comes down to scope, huh, Velveeta tw2113
[19:49:02] <Velveeta> well, by isolating the scope in that callback function, those variables are destroyed upon exit anyway
[19:54:16] <Vivekananda> oo you are around
[19:54:24] <Velveeta> yup
[20:03:31] <Velveeta> we just flipped it over to the olympic opening ceremony, and they're playing tron soundtrack for part of the show
[20:05:15] <tw2113> meanwhile i youtube Aqua
[20:05:22] <superphly> i really, really hate the stupid olympic ceremonies. I mean, what the hell is it? It doesn't get anyone amped, it plays no role, wtf?
[20:05:43] <tw2113> superphly, just picture them like the Hunger Games
[20:05:50] <Velveeta> i've enjoyed the past couple, i was surprised at the one in the UK
[20:06:04] <Vivekananda> hmm nice
[20:06:06] <Velveeta> tw2113: a hunger games event would definitely amp me up as a viewer
[20:06:10] <Vivekananda> olympics
[20:06:30] <tw2113> i still think hunger games should be a valid form of election
[20:06:47] <Velveeta> absolutely, let all the politicians kill each other off, and then we only have to deal with 1
[20:08:55] <Vivekananda> wondering if I should interrupt the festive spirit with my question
[20:09:02] <tw2113> yes
[20:09:53] <Vivekananda> okay then
[20:10:42] <Velveeta> yeah go for it
[20:11:58] <Vivekananda> I want to find how I can change an autocomplte jquery text search box to slowly change into a bigger box containing the result of ajax get and also showing the query searched box ( a jquery qutocomplete widget) and place below showing the results
[20:12:03] <Vivekananda> or something similar
[20:16:19] <Velveeta> let me work on something and see what you think
[20:17:41] <FriendlySeal> dun help him
[20:22:50] <Vivekananda> FriendlySeal: and that is coz ?
[20:22:58] <FriendlySeal> iduno
[20:23:08] <Vivekananda> ok
[20:23:20] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I would love to learn and do parts of it myself
[20:24:02] <Velveeta> vivekananda: well first we have to get an idea of what kind of transformation you actually want from this thing, after that, i can point you to things to read up on for learning it
[20:27:26] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: any kind is fine
[20:27:34] <Vivekananda> as long at I can control the speed
[20:27:42] <Vivekananda> fast medium slow
[20:33:28] <Velveeta> vivekananda: ok, here's a first look, done in a semi-hackish way because of the opacity used on the background: http://jsbin.com/bozox/1
[20:37:21] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/9LS5y/
[20:37:28] <jsharpminor> Need some help if possible.
[20:37:33] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: that is an autcomplete box
[20:37:37] <jsharpminor> Trying to make items disappear in multiple places.
[20:37:47] <Velveeta> vivekananda: didn't you say you wanted an autocomplete?
[20:37:50] <Vivekananda> but how do I make it morph into a div
[20:37:53] <Vivekananda> no no
[20:37:55] <Vivekananda> lol
[20:37:56] <Vivekananda> shoot
[20:38:07] <jsharpminor> This code appears to not do anything in jsfiddle, but in my site it's at least making list 1 go away.
[20:38:07] <Vivekananda> I said I already have an autcomplete box
[20:38:32] <Vivekananda> I want to find how I can change an autocomplte jquery text search box to slowly change into a bigger box containing the result of ajax get and also showing the query searched box ( a jquery qutocomplete widget) and place below showing the results
[20:38:32] <Vivekananda> <Vivekananda> or something similar
[20:39:08] <Velveeta> yeah that's kind of difficult to decipher
[20:39:23] <jsharpminor> Oh, I forgot to enable jQuery in JSFiddle. Now it runs.
[20:39:30] <Velveeta> i assumed you were just talking about making a larger container for your autocomplete on focus
[20:39:30] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/9LS5y/1/
[20:39:45] <jsharpminor> But still doesn't delete the item-2 from the second list.
[20:40:00] <jsharpminor> Anyone with a chance to help would be appreciated.
[20:40:21] <jsharpminor> I'll shut up and stand in line now. :-)
[20:40:26] <Velveeta> jsharpminor: so what *should* it be displaying if this were to execute properly?
[20:40:44] <jsharpminor> Nothing.
[20:40:56] <jsharpminor> Actually, it should display "Starts with A"
[20:40:58] <jsharpminor> And that's about it
[20:41:09] <Velveeta> but none of the items within Starts with A?
[20:41:14] <jsharpminor> Right.
[20:41:19] <Velveeta> ok let me read through it
[20:41:22] <jsharpminor> And yes, I committed the cardinal sin of using identical IDs.
[20:41:36] <FriendlySeal> u idiot
[20:41:44] <FriendlySeal> dats y u use classes
[20:42:17] <jsharpminor> I am maintaining somene else's code.
[20:42:21] <jsharpminor> I just realized the ID issue.
[20:42:29] <jsharpminor> I intend to fix that at a later time.
[20:42:37] <jsharpminor> But for now I can't figure out why this isn't running.
[20:42:38] <Velveeta> don't mind seal, he's still learning soft skills
[20:42:41] <jsharpminor> lol
[20:42:44] <jsharpminor> he's friendly enough
[20:43:12] <jsharpminor> btw much obliged to you for your time
[20:44:22] <FriendlySeal> im the Friendliest seal
[20:44:26] <FriendlySeal> eveeeeeeeeeer!
[20:45:03] <jsharpminor> ba da daaaa da da daaa da da daaaaa, da da da.
[20:45:05] <jsharpminor> ba da daaaa da da daaa da da daaaaa, da da da.
[20:45:06] <jsharpminor> There
[20:45:12] <jsharpminor> used to be a graying tower alone by the sea
[20:45:22] <Velveeta> jsharpminor: so i'm confused here about what removeAll thinks it's operating on
[20:45:32] <Velveeta> because i see 3 duplicate sets of removes in there
[20:45:56] <jsharpminor> Each of those will find one of the 3 duplicate ID items, delete it, and quit.
[20:45:59] <Velveeta> and it looks like it's expecting linkName to be a number, since it's grabbing a .substring(4) of "Item1"
[20:46:30] <Velveeta> so it's expecting to find each of the (e.g.) "Item2" elements and remove it
[20:46:35] <jsharpminor> yes
[20:46:40] <jsharpminor> Actually
[20:46:43] <jsharpminor> each 2, 3, and 4
[20:46:45] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: Does my question sound completely non sensical ? if I cannot animate it how about on pressing enter in a search box the box disappears but a big div takes it palce containing columns of the result of the search ?
[20:46:52] <jsharpminor> but only one extra 2 exists
[20:46:55] <jsharpminor> and no more 3s and 4s
[20:47:00] <Velveeta> ok, is it always trying to remove all of them, or is it always trying to remove exactly 3 of them? for instance, what if there are 5 sets of duplicates?
[20:47:01] <jsharpminor> Those will go away when 1 is deleted
[20:47:22] <jsharpminor> For this application each item will never have more than 3. One in display, one in edit, one alphabetized.
[20:47:25] <Vivekananda> or not even disappear just a new box appears with results below it but which has word wrapping turned on ?
[20:47:44] <jsharpminor> It's not a case of bad db design here... we took care of that one last month :-)
[20:47:54] <Velveeta> vivekananda: well it sounds like what you're wanting isn't a typeahead autocomplete… if you're scrapping the text box and showing the results of the current search string, you're not giving them the ability to continue typing to refine their search string
[20:48:14] <Velveeta> jsharpminor: gotcha
[20:50:48] <Velveeta> jsharpminor: ok, tell me if this looks closer to the expected behavior: http://jsfiddle.net/9LS5y/2/
[20:51:05] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: o no no I guess I did not explain well . the use is case is like this : user begins typing and auctocomplete kicks in. User either clicks on an option or types a complete word and then clicks submit. On clicking submit a div pops up showing DEtailed result of the chosen word as opposed to autocomplete just showing the compact options for words to choose from
[20:51:06] <Velveeta> and then add some more markup and see if it continues behaving like you expect it to, or if i have one of your business rules wrong
[20:51:07] <jsharpminor> well the result looks right
[20:51:10] <Vivekananda> does it make sense
[20:52:40] <Velveeta> vivekananda: so you want a standard autocomplete, but when they start typing, show expanded options including a submit button, and if they click submit, it pops up an extra layer with some detailed info?
[20:53:02] <Vivekananda> yes !!
[20:53:11] <Vivekananda> the standard autocomplete I already have
[20:53:16] <Velveeta> then it sounds like you're gonna want a new widget that uses autocomplete as a base
[20:53:40] <Velveeta> but expands that functionality to provide this extra stuff you're looking for
[20:53:51] <Vivekananda> I was thinking that if I attach an onclick listener to the submit button then
[20:54:07] <Vivekananda> it can inturn populate + hide/unhide a div box
[20:54:11] <FriendlySeal> Vivekananda,
[20:54:14] <FriendlySeal> come to my site
[20:54:16] <FriendlySeal> plzplz
[20:54:17] <FriendlySeal> :D
[20:55:21] <Velveeta> vivekananda: yeah, you're gonna want to do that with more than just some extra listeners, you'll want to do it as an extended widget using autocomplete as a base prototype
[20:56:00] <Vivekananda> I am looking at this also http://jsfiddle.net/Bq6eK/1/
[20:56:04] <Vivekananda> example from someone
[20:56:11] <Vivekananda> FriendlySeal: what is your site ?
[20:56:26] <FriendlySeal> http://noteys.com/
[20:57:51] <Velveeta> vivekananda: yeah, that's just a simple show/hide toggle, what you're talking about is a bit more complex than that, it's not just showing and hiding content, it's also interactions and data transactions
[21:04:20] <FriendlySeal> make a upload
[21:08:37] <FriendlySeal> do u gaize think its worth it to move from php backend to java
[21:09:17] <FriendlySeal> just from a speed perspective
[21:09:18] <Velveeta> no
[21:09:29] <Velveeta> php's come a long way in the last several years
[21:09:47] <Velveeta> and the ttm for large-scale java apps is a lot longer than writing the same code in php
[21:09:47] <FriendlySeal> i was thinking about eventualy doing a c++ backend
[21:10:24] <FriendlySeal> yes the strict type in java is a pain for web apps
[21:10:31] <Vivekananda>  FriendlySeal a lovely site
[21:10:35] <Vivekananda> what is it about ?
[21:10:50] <FriendlySeal> its like tumbler
[21:10:59] <FriendlySeal> or imagur
[21:11:05] <FriendlySeal> and paste all in one lol
[21:11:28] <FriendlySeal> my old static noteys site has the code syntax stuff
[21:11:34] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: I am fine with basic showing and hiding content on the div. I believe I can change the div to show() after filling it up using a jquery get resut ()
[21:11:35] <FriendlySeal> and i even wrote my own diffing
[21:11:52] <FriendlySeal> i see that pastebin added diffing try to copy me
[21:11:54] <FriendlySeal> lol
[21:12:05] <FriendlySeal> but they guy suked at doing it
[21:12:16] <FriendlySeal> he didnt highlight the actual changes
[21:12:28] <FriendlySeal> he jsut replace the whole old line w new line
[21:12:38] <FriendlySeal> i actually highlight each char that is diff
[21:12:49] <FriendlySeal> just like trac
[21:14:07] <FriendlySeal> i friken lost my python site
[21:14:13] <FriendlySeal> can u beliv it
[21:14:18] <FriendlySeal> that was all my google maps code
[21:14:20] <FriendlySeal> fah
[21:14:30] <Velveeta> vivekananda: but you're still talking about altering the way autocomplete itself works internally, which would be best accomplished by using it as a base prototype and extending it through the widget factory to create a new widget based upon it
[21:23:09] <FriendlySeal> i experienced code loss
[21:23:11] <FriendlySeal> lol
[21:23:27] <FriendlySeal> its not a good feeling
[21:56:20] <Vivekananda> Velveeta: cannot I add an onclick to the submit button which is quite separate from the autocomplete itself ( I make it so )
[21:56:37] <Vivekananda> and just get the value inside the automplete search box for the search to go through and stuff
[21:56:57] <Velveeta> sure, but you were talking about altering the popup too right?
[22:07:11] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for tonight
[22:35:53] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: did you see my final code?
