[07:37:48] <kappa1> hi, can I load a web page to memory when I am at another web page from a different domain?
[10:28:19] <sine0> hey, so I have some code that injects elements into the page during user interaction. however I have a bind click event listening that does not trigger/fire when something is clicked. is that because the element is injected later on or should it work
[10:29:30] <sine0> so line 9 never fires when I click the button that has that ID https://bpa.st/SNTQ
[10:30:05] <sine0> I guess what I am saying is; can it init the bind if the element does not exist yet
