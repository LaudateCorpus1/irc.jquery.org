[02:36:20] <ether_> Hello
[02:37:29] <ether_> I am trying to find a plugin that has a animates coins. Like in a game when you collect coins, it flies to the top with a nice little animation. Can't find anything like this
[03:06:37] <ekkis> hei everyone, I'm working with flexslider and I'm having some issues... I described them here: https://github.com/woocommerce/FlexSlider/issues/1606 any help would be, well... helpful :)
[05:04:20] <TheDude> hi to all
[05:04:29] <TheDude> I have a question
[05:07:54] <TheDude> I have enqueue a .js file into a custom plug-in file (.php) with wp_enqueue_script( 'jpay', path/to/file.js, array('jquery'))
[05:08:56] <TheDude> i need to use that with jquery for runtime check of what a user digit into the inputs of a form
[05:09:45] <TheDude> I have the code to show into gist of github
[05:10:40] <TheDude> someone can help me to understand where I'm doing wrong ??
[05:11:23] <Leviticus> hi
[05:11:39] <Leviticus> I have a really weird problem concerning a very, very basic script
[05:11:56] <Leviticus> $(document).ready(function() {   if($(window).width() < 500) { alert('smaller than 500px'); }    else { alert('larger than 500px'); }   });
[05:12:09] <Leviticus> is there *any* possible reason why this does not work out as expected?
[05:12:17] <Leviticus> (the problem:  Nothing happens)
[05:16:56] <akkonrad> after form is submitted (button clicked) I would like to make ajax request and save result in cookie, then I'd like to trigger all submit work
[07:38:39] <verax5> hmm onclick even wont work : (
[07:38:39] <verax5> https://jsfiddle.net/gzoxrkor/
[07:39:30] <shoky> try including jquery
[07:42:15] <verax5> ye it doesnt work on localhost for some reasoin...
[07:43:11] <verax5> oh nvm :)
[07:43:17] <verax5> wasnt clicking the right element
[07:46:04] <verax5> doesnt work : (
[07:47:52] <verax5> for some reason on localhost it submits.. https://jsfiddle.net/gzoxrkor/1/
[08:02:01] <verax5> need some help pleease unable to get value
[08:02:31] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/MKVMEB3J
[08:02:41] <verax5> returns same value every time i click
[08:07:52] <AdamPDotty> You are handing out IDs in a foreach loop. In that case they should be variable.
[08:08:38] <AdamPDotty> or just use a class
[08:08:42] <verax5> adam
[08:08:43] <Cork> or better ye... exactly :)
[08:09:00] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/3i5s033B
[08:09:15] <verax5> i want the element that user clicked on, it only gives me first element
[08:09:40] <Cork> verax5: firstly you have to change the click selector too
[08:09:42] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/HrZm0Hum
[08:09:46] <Cork> so it grabs more then one element
[08:09:50] <verax5> cork
[08:09:57] <verax5> i only neeed one element
[08:10:01] <verax5> one valuye
[08:10:06] <verax5> only the value user clicked on
[08:10:15] <Cork> and then you use $(this).find/closest so on
[08:10:28] <Cork> verax5: you want one answer related to your event handler ya
[08:10:29] <verax5> so it's like UserA, userB, userC. So if user clicks on userC I wanna get it's ID
[08:10:35] <AdamPDotty> $(this).closest('tr').find('.userId') ...
[08:10:41] <Cork> you can't have an id as it means only one answer
[08:10:54] <Cork> (and always that answer)
[08:11:15] <Cork> also note 'span#clickedUser' is a waste of time just do '#clickedUser'
[08:11:34] <Cork> you can't be more specific then an id, you are only slowing down the selector by first selecting a node name
[08:11:38] <Cork> and then checking the id
[08:12:21] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/08Vnb0Hs
[08:12:25] <verax5> lemme try that
[08:12:31] <AdamPDotty> Hmm, does "input" slow down "input[type='submit']"?
[08:12:36] <Cork> no
[08:12:44] <Cork> cause node is faster then attribute selectors
[08:12:53] <verax5> basicallly im sending only 1 id to server
[08:13:02] <Cork> id > class >>>>> node >>>>>> attribute >>> attribute value >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> content
[08:13:27] <verax5> i think im making it harder than it is
[08:13:29] <AdamPDotty> Thanks!
[08:13:41] <verax5> cant understand why my solution wont work
[08:13:45] <verax5> it seem to make sense
[08:13:48] <Cork> AdamPDotty: note with modern browsers class and id is the same speed
[08:13:58] <Cork> as both are a hash lookup in the browser
[08:14:29] <Cork> the only speed difference is that you have to handle arrays in the result
[08:14:40] <Cork> (but as jquery normalize the answer to an array...
[08:14:43] <Cork> )
[08:14:58] <Cork> verax5: in dom an id is unique
[08:15:04] <Cork> verax5: two elements can't have the same id
[08:15:45] <verax5> shoud this not work then cork?
[08:15:45] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/wj4wkSXp
[08:16:01] <Cork> verax5: yes, except you will get all the elements
[08:16:13] <Cork> as you don't specify what relation you want to filter on
[08:16:30] <Cork> that is where $(this).closest('tr').find comes in
[08:17:23] <Cork> opps except there it shouldn't be find
[08:17:52] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').children('.userId').text()
[08:17:56] <Cork> is what you want too have
[08:19:51] <verax5> it worked
[08:19:57] <verax5> but so compicated lo
[08:20:01] <verax5> jauqery so hard man
[08:20:12] <verax5> i need to take some lesson on it
[08:25:32] <Cork> verax5: this is what you want https://jsfiddle.net/10navkep/4/
[08:29:56] <verax5> that worked man
[08:29:59] <verax5> thanks alot
[08:55:32] <hellyeah> hey
[08:55:48] <hellyeah> js's quetion is welcomed here?
[08:55:49] <hellyeah> what i did here just put the result to the exports object? what is the deal https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/js9qmfrv/4/
[08:56:01] <hellyeah> is it about writing the code? can you pls take a look?
[08:56:07] <hellyeah> thanks
[09:39:02] <Cork> hellyeah: that question should prob go in ##javascript
[09:39:26] <Cork> hellyeah: though what is the question?
[09:40:01] <hellyeah> question is what way you prefer while writing js? namespacing or modules?
[09:40:29] <Cork> it depends on what you plan to use it with
[09:40:44] <hellyeah> it always depends
[09:40:52] <Cork> i wouldn't use the two for the same thing
[09:41:00] <Cork> i would even use both in some cases
[09:41:17] <hellyeah> can you elobrate it?
[09:41:29] <hellyeah> "some cases" is vague for me?
[09:41:31] <Cork> its too generic
[09:41:52] <Cork> mobules is more when you want to make a component for someone else to consume
[09:42:18] <Cork> namespace is more a sanity solution to separate the code you write so it doesn't steps on eachother
[09:42:31] <Cork> bulding the code you use for a site in modules i don't see the point in
[09:42:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:42:47] <Cork> but to write a helper lib as a module might make perfect sense
[09:43:14] <hellyeah> ah
[09:43:20] <hellyeah> i see what you mean
[09:43:39] <Cork> also worth meantioning modules are namespaces
[09:43:45] <hellyeah> so jquery ui libs were written with modular?
[09:43:47] <Cork> it is just extended namespaces
[09:43:55] <Cork> yes
[09:44:16] <hellyeah> ic
[09:44:30] <hellyeah> so namespacing is enough for me i dont write library
[09:44:53] <Cork> or more specifically modules are namespaces with a specific mechanism to expose functions
[09:45:06] <Cork> normally ya
[09:45:31] <hellyeah> what does "expose function" mean here?
[09:45:58] <Cork> well when you write code you want a scope or a namespace so the function name you pick doesn't replace someones else
[09:46:48] <hellyeah> var queue = new function(){ make : function(){...} } }
[09:46:55] <Cork> if you rarely need to expose code from one scope/namespace to another it is just waste of time to drag around the infrastructure to support that
[09:47:12] <Cork> that's a constructor not a namespace
[09:47:14] <hellyeah> function make is in queue's scope
[09:47:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:47:29] <Cork> the simplest form of namespace is just (function() {})();
[09:47:44] <Cork> it has a very limited support for exposing functions
[09:47:57] <Cork> (it can attach things to window, but that's it)
[09:48:00] <hellyeah> function is anynomous is
[09:48:03] <hellyeah> so it namespace
[09:48:07] <Cork> no
[09:48:08] <hellyeah> it has own scope
[09:48:17] <Cork> it is a self executing function
[09:48:23] <Cork> creating a local name scope
[09:48:38] <hellyeah> i read only function can create scope in js
[09:48:51] <Cork> in es< 6 yes
[09:49:15] <Cork> in es6 you can just do { let localVariable = 1; } localVariable == undefined
[09:49:27] <Cork> but ya, that isn't cross browser yet
[09:49:49] <hellyeah> { ... } this defines code block right
[09:49:56] <Cork> yes
[09:49:57] <hellyeah> so it is actually like function
[09:50:01] <Cork> no
[09:50:07] <Cork> a block isn't a function
[09:50:16] <Cork> a function takes a block
[09:50:23] <Cork> but not the other way around
[09:50:48] <hellyeah> how to call code block {..} is it invoked immediately?
[09:50:57] <Cork> yes
[09:51:01] <hellyeah> ic
[09:51:03] <Cork> it isn't invoked exactly
[09:51:08] <Cork> it is executing just like normal
[09:51:17] <Cork> it just gets isolated "let" variables
[09:51:45] <hellyeah> what about this { .. } { ... } are these executed in order?
[09:51:50] <Cork> yes
[09:52:03] <hellyeah> ah good
[09:52:26] <Cork> with a block you can ignore the {}s existance for the code flow
[09:52:28] <hellyeah> i really what i learnt here i didnt use code block yet
[09:52:34] <hellyeah> so it is es6 feature ic
[09:52:36] <Cork> it only affect variable name lookup
[09:52:55] <hellyeah> i can use { .. } and use let
[09:53:05] <Cork> eh...
[09:53:09] <Cork> well soon
[09:53:09] <hellyeah> actually it can be interesting to like that
[09:53:33] <hellyeah> especially your functionality divides into some pieces like A, B , C, D , E
[09:53:42] <hellyeah> it is dependent to each other
[09:54:00] <hellyeah> b is dependent to A C is dependent B and A and such..
[09:54:08] <hellyeah> do i udnerstand correctly?
[09:54:37] <hellyeah> i will try and see
[09:55:04] <hellyeah> so what i learnt today is this and the preferences about namespacing?
[09:55:14] <hellyeah> you suggest me to use "namespace"
[09:55:34] <hellyeah> module is for something that is more advanced
[10:00:41] <GAD> Can someone suggest a good tutorial on working with jQuery Boilerplate ?
[10:03:00] <verax5> guys
[10:31:43] <snufft> would anyone be able to tell me how I go about getting the postal code (5034) from the json return? this is the json: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=-40.900557,174.885971
[10:34:18] <shoky> snufft: here's one way.. data.results[0].address_components.filter(c => c.types[0] === 'postal_code')[0].short_name
[10:34:51] <taplar> element.results.address_components.find(function(component){ return component.types[0] === 'postal_code'; }).long_name or something
[10:35:59] <snufft> cheers guys! i'll give them a hit :D
[10:36:32] <taplar> results should be results[0] in mine like in shokys
[10:44:30] <verax5> any help guys?
[10:44:31] <verax5> cant concatenate.. $('#complaintsDisplay').append("<a href='returnData[i].id'> returnData[i].title </a>");
[10:46:33] <taplar> "start of a string"+ aVariable +" more string"
[10:46:50] <shoky> var $a = $('<a>').attr('href', returnData[i].id).text(returnData[i].title);  $a.appendTo('#complaintsDisplay')
[10:47:00] <shoky> and don't use for loops to iterate over arrays :\
[10:47:12] <shoky> .forEach or .map
[10:50:28] <hellyeah> you have to return something with map you can use filter or reduce that has spesific purposes
[10:50:44] <taplar> ?
[10:50:47] <verax5> lordd......
[10:50:53] <hellyeah> am i wrong? :D
[10:50:55] <verax5> all that for one anchorr
[10:51:00] <verax5> shit man this so compex
[10:51:17] * hellyeah backing off :p
[10:51:31] <verax5> these quotes driving me crazy
[10:51:52] <taplar> so do what shoky suggested if you don't like the concat way
[10:52:09] <hellyeah> i wish js has string builder
[10:52:14] <hellyeah> may be es6 has it
[10:52:22] <verax5> lemme try map then taplar
[10:52:47] <hellyeah> good day
[10:52:52] <verax5> isnt it the same thing tho?
[10:53:04] <verax5> i'd still be spitting values to help anyways
[10:53:08] <taplar> the result will be the same.  just how you want to get there
[10:53:23] <verax5> what can i do about these concatenation
[10:53:35] <verax5> just wanna insert an anchor
[10:55:45] <majorshake> Is there any problem with jQuery CDN at the moment?
[10:56:11] <majorshake> Google Chrome is reporting that the SSL certificate for code.jquery.com has been revoked
[10:57:17] <taplar> heh, would be funny if it was still the sha-1 cert
[10:58:40] <majorshake> Requests using other machines seem to work, as do requests using CURL
[10:58:59] <verax5>             $('#complaintsDisplay').append("<a href='" + returnData[i].id + "'>  '"+ returnData[i].complain_title + "'  </a>");
[10:59:10] <verax5> seems fine
[10:59:13] <verax5> but also displaying ' '
[10:59:34] <taplar> you don't need those ticks
[11:00:28] <verax5> can have double quote inside doube quotes?
[11:00:32] <verax5> hows that possible
[11:00:40] <verax5> thought that wasnt valid
[11:00:41] <taplar> no, you don't need the single ticks around the link value
[11:01:04] <taplar> whatever delimiter you use ' or " to start with, you have to use that to stop the string
[11:01:16] <taplar> then whatever you put inside is just what ever is valid for the html
[11:01:34] <taplar> i'd recommend using ' on the outer in this case
[11:01:42] <taplar> since usually people write html with "
[11:02:30] <akkonrad> localStorage.getItem works on chrome, but not in firefox. same with document.cookie, it's undefined in firefox
[11:02:32] <taplar> '<a href="'+ someValue +'">'+ someLabel +'</a>';
[11:03:23] <majorshake> Nobody else having any SSL problems then?
[11:03:24] <verax5> taplar
[11:03:40] <verax5> am i doing it the wrong way of is it usually just like this, this messy
[11:03:49] <taplar> yep, it's going to be messy
[11:04:05] <taplar> otherwise you could do something like
[11:04:07] <verax5> i just realized i want that inside a table..
[11:04:10] <verax5> this gonna be pain
[11:05:10] <taplar> '<a href="{url}">{urlText}</a>'.replace(/\{url\}/, returnData[i].id).replace(/\{urlText\}/, returnData[i].complain_title);
[11:05:24] <verax5> fukkk
[11:05:26] <taplar> or again, do what shoky suggested, :)
[11:05:40] <verax5> shoky suggested useing map
[11:05:52] <verax5> but that wont make any difference when it comes to displaying data will it
[11:06:00] <taplar> shoky: var $a = $('<a>').attr('href', returnData[i].id).text(returnData[i].title); $a.appendTo('#complaintsDisplay')
[11:34:26] <Cupertina> Anyone here has experience scraping facebook? I'm trying to scrape the about page but the HTML is very unstructured
[11:35:21] <Cupertina> the user profile about page that is
[12:13:29] <ExeciN> I'm looking at this line: $("#example p").css("font-size", "+=1pt"); each time it gets executed the font-size gets increased. Is "+=1pt" a feature of CSS in this case?
[12:14:38] <jbeeze> +=1pt is a feature of the .css method from jQuery
[12:15:01] <jbeeze> it pulls in the original font size, and adds 1pt to it
[12:15:07] <jbeeze> you wouldn't be able to do that in regular css
[12:15:24] <ExeciN> ah ok, thanks
[12:15:41] <jbeeze> http://api.jquery.com/css/ for more info
[14:42:45] <taplar> weeeeeeeee

[15:04:28] <NTrash> I need help me aligning the nav links with the black lines on the left side https://jsfiddle.net/ktmf0mf8/1/
[15:07:34] <MassDebates> NTrash:  Ah, I see what was causing the alignment to get messed up.
[15:07:52] <MassDebates> You had some sort of silly script animating a change that effectively undid any alignment they had with the lines.
[15:08:00] <MassDebates> NTrash:  check this out. I got rid of that pesky thing for ya. https://jsfiddle.net/ktmf0mf8/2/
[15:08:07] <MassDebates> xD
[15:15:19] <NTrash> How are you allowed to troll like this
[15:16:47] <MassDebates> Oh, I typically only troll questions that I feel certainly don't have enough detail to be reliably, efficiently, and quickly answered. Perhaps you can say a bit more about the alignment you need?
[15:17:10] <MassDebates> NTrash:  Let me know when you do!

[15:36:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, I'm not seeing it with chrome.
[15:36:30] <robertmaxrees> you up to date?

[15:36:53] <DDinDallas> Chrome Version 53.0.2785.113

[16:07:03] <z1haze_work> anyone used the youtube iframe api? I have been using it for months now, and now ive got problems. http://dpaste.com/2QAJP53 the console.log() is not firing on this, but if i console.log() inside the getScript it does
[16:07:04] <z1haze_work> any ideas?
[16:07:52] <robertmaxrees> try .fail(function() {console.log('failure'});
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> oh, i get it.
[16:08:16] <z1haze_work> without .fail() does success and fail get triggered inside the main callback?
[16:08:22] <z1haze_work> i thought it would only log if it was successful
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:08:34] <robertmaxrees> .done() is only for successful ones.
[16:08:38] <z1haze_work> .done() lets me console.log() so that means it doesnt fail.
[16:08:50] <robertmaxrees> right jhence why i said "oh i get it".
[16:09:00] <jbeeze> .done() will always trigget whether or not the status that comes back true or false
[16:09:10] <jbeeze> .fail() will hit if the API request never gets hit
[16:09:11] <robertmaxrees> jbeeze not ture.
[16:09:16] <robertmaxrees> also not true.
[16:09:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to register the callback before you load the script.
[16:11:20] <z1haze_work> not sure what you mean
[16:11:45] <robertmaxrees> put that window.onYouTubePlayerAPIReady = function() { before the getscript call.
[16:12:09] <z1haze_work> ok
[16:12:31] <robertmaxrees> the js file itself calls that function when it loads, so it has to exist before you load it.
[16:13:09] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/3BSC6PN
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> did you try? :)
[16:13:56] <z1haze_work> of course
[16:13:57] <z1haze_work> no dice
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> open your network panel - are you sure you're successfully getting the file?
[16:14:22] <z1haze_work> not getting any feedback either
[16:14:50] <z1haze_work> woudl that show up i nthe network panel when its getScript()? i wasnt sure
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:15:47] <z1haze_work> then no, it is not
[16:15:58] <z1haze_work> its not trying to either
[16:16:07] <robertmaxrees> then you're not running this code at all.
[16:16:11] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste it into your console.
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> it should work.
[16:16:19] <z1haze_work> ok
[16:16:21] <al_nz1> taplar: your bridge made the news here lol
[16:16:23] <al_nz1> epic fial
[16:16:31] <taplar> oh?
[16:16:32] <taplar> :D
[16:16:50] <z1haze_work> i says object
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work right, because that's the return value of getScript.
[16:17:07] <taplar> al_nz1: hey, we're not good with implosions.  i'll take that as a win
[16:17:13] <robertmaxrees> are you getting the network request now?
[16:17:25] <al_nz1> taplar: was obviously over engineered
[16:17:34] <taplar> which part?
[16:18:06] <al_nz1> hey so I tried to jquery select <select class="selectpicker relationship" id="relationship" data-live-search="true" title="Choose"> using ".selectpicker.relationship" but it does exist in the DOM (length was 0) however #relationship works
[16:18:13] <z1haze_work> no robertmaxrees
[16:18:19] <al_nz1> again its a bootstrap form select picker
[16:18:26] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work then you have another issue.
[16:18:28] <al_nz1> any ideas why the class wont work?
[16:18:38] <robertmaxrees> al-damiri should work fine.
[16:18:49] <taplar> al_nz1: i'd have to see it not work
[16:19:01] <taplar> the id look is better though anyway
[16:19:07] <z1haze_work> hmm
[16:19:27] <al_nz1> ok
[16:19:31] <z1haze_work> what in the world could it be
[16:19:49] <al_nz1> I guess even though I can do it with id, I like to know why things dont work as expected :)
[16:19:55] <taplar> oh sure
[16:19:59] <al_nz1> I can screen share
[16:20:02] <robertmaxrees> err al_nz1 https://jsfiddle.net/7khkyz2f/
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[16:20:12] <taplar> <-- at work, ;)
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work i have no idea.  you'll need to make a fiddle.
[16:20:56] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I swear it aint working here.
[16:21:03] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 no idea then.
[16:21:12] <z1haze_work> oh wait robertmaxrees, i was looking in the xhr tab, but for whateve reason i twasnt coming through that tab
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> al-damiri i'd have to see it fail, but the test case functions.
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work right, because it's a script.
[16:21:26] <robertmaxrees> not an xhr call.
[16:21:30] <z1haze_work> it is loading
[16:21:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work okay.  and it's a 200?
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> like, you're actually loading it?
[16:21:55] <z1haze_work> yes
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> and you're not loading it more than once?
[16:22:46] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: are you in a position to view my screen?
[16:22:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.  i'm at work al_nz1
[16:23:03] <z1haze_work> well the script has if (!window['YT'])
[16:23:04] <robertmaxrees> you really need to make a test case instead anyway :)
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work huh?
[16:23:21] <robertmaxrees> which script?
[16:23:31] <z1haze_work> the script that is returned from the api call
[16:23:32] <z1haze_work> if (!window['YT'])
[16:23:34] <al_nz1> I will see if I can reproduce on a fiddle
[16:23:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work lol
[16:23:46] <z1haze_work> sowould it matter if its loading twice
[16:23:52] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work probably.
[16:23:59] <arosen> Hi, I'm using the taphold event and wanted to change the timeout values so I read I needed to include jquery.mobile to get access to those via: $.event.special.tap.tapholdThreshold  . My question is, why when i include jquery.mobile does it automatically add css elements to my body tags and other things? After including jquery.mobile my application no longer  renders.
[16:24:02] <robertmaxrees> it probably won't run on anything after the first load
[16:24:24] <robertmaxrees> arosen because that's part of what jquery mobile does.
[16:24:46] <robertmaxrees> if you only need to chgange timeout values for taphold, look for something other than including ALL of jqm.
[16:25:59] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  Is the taphold event something that is implemented in the jquery code? Just seems odd that i have access to that but to change the timeout value one needs jquery.mobile.
[16:26:00] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: try : https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/18/
[16:26:00] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help it led me to the solution
[16:26:05] <al_nz1> length is 0
[16:26:21] <robertmaxrees> arosen where are you seeing this info?
[16:27:15] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 is your code in a script tag in your <head>?
[16:27:19] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  i'm seeing the following work in my application:     $("body").delegate(".item", "taphold", function(e) { ..});  -> timeout value change here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9293249/jquery-mobile-change-the-taphold-sensitivity
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> and is it not wrapped in a doc ready?
[16:27:40] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: nah - seperate file
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> arosen okay, so you're not using jquery mobile already - that article is for people using jquery mobile.
[16:28:07] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 is that separate file loaded after your content/is it in a doc ready?
[16:28:27] <al_nz1> yes it is in doc ready
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 no clue then, because https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/19/
[16:28:52] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle is using the "no wrap - in head" option.
[16:29:12] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  my confusion or i  iguess question is, does jquery implement the taphold event?
[16:29:32] <arosen> or i guess just the handler and the event is implemented somewhere else?
[16:29:49] <robertmaxrees> arosen taphold is implemented by jquery mobile last i checked.
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> also: .delegate is deprecated, but you can take care of that separately.
[16:30:42] <arosen> robertmaxrees: so I am not using jquery mobile but  $("body").delegate(".item", "taphold", function(e) { ..});   works for me.
[16:30:46] <arosen> this is why i was confusee.
[16:31:12] <taplar> use on() instead of delegate()
[16:31:15] <arosen> anyways, i'll find some other way to handle it. Was hoping there was a way to disable jquery.mobile from doing this.
[16:31:20] <al_nz1> hmmm
[16:31:31] <taplar> ah, already mentioned
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> arosen you can.
[16:31:35] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't make sense to.
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> since you don't really want to load jqm in the first place.
[16:32:16] <arosen> maybe i'm getting the tabHold event from this framework i'm using: https://framework7.io/docs/tap-hold.html
[16:33:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:33:03] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[16:33:16] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: Ok I added doc ready to that fiddle and it worked
[16:33:18] <robertmaxrees> and it has an option for delay.
[16:33:24] <al_nz1> looks like its something to do with my doc ready
[16:33:25] <arosen> yup yup, i'll use that.
[16:33:27] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 right - just like i added.
[16:33:32] <arosen> thanks. Sorry for the confusion. :)
[16:33:35] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 make sure your markup is valid.
[16:33:39] <robertmaxrees> arosen all good mang :D
[16:37:25] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: here is the full code and its not working. https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/22/
[16:37:30] <al_nz1> what have I dont wrong
[16:38:09] <robertmaxrees> lo.
[16:38:11] <robertmaxrees> really?
[16:40:02] <robertmaxrees> first off, that fiddle is loading two copies of jquery.
[16:41:34] <al_nz1> ok
[16:41:37] <al_nz1> fixed
[16:41:51] <robertmaxrees> how your handlers fire.
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/25/
[16:42:09] <robertmaxrees> *now your handlers fire.
[16:43:03] <al_nz1> what did you do?
[16:43:10] <robertmaxrees> i removed one of the copies of jquery.,
[16:43:13] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:47:07] <robertmaxrees> back
[16:47:24] <al_nz1> hey
[16:47:40] <al_nz1> yeah so something is different between the fiddle and my local content
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> content or environment?
[16:48:19] <al_nz1> well this fiddle has 1 jquery : https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/26/
[16:48:23] <al_nz1> but still not firing
[16:48:36] <robertmaxrees> it has two.
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/hF44a8v.png
[16:49:17] <al_nz1> why is that two?
[16:49:25] <robertmaxrees> see the dropdown?
[16:49:29] <robertmaxrees> that's loading one copy.
[16:49:37] <robertmaxrees> you're then loading another under "external resources"
[16:49:40] <robertmaxrees> that's two copies.
[16:49:50] <al_nz1> but it the link I just posted I removed the external one
[16:49:51] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/26/
[16:50:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:50:06] <robertmaxrees> tjhat link still has jquery under external resource.
[16:52:00] <al_nz1> nope : https://snag.gy/X9rfHF.jpg
[16:52:24] <robertmaxrees> then hit "update"
[16:52:28] <robertmaxrees> and sharte the new link out.
[16:53:11] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/28/
[16:53:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm still seeing it in that link.
[16:53:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ont26wr6/29/ try this.
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha for some reason it's bugging out.
[16:55:08] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but in any event I only have one copy of jquery in my pc getting loaded and this class not being found in the dom is getting annoying!
[16:55:13] <robertmaxrees> here https://jsfiddle.net/yxj1L9um/
[16:55:20] <robertmaxrees> no idea then man.
[16:55:27] <al_nz1> I got a better idea
[16:55:32] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you ok for PM?
[16:55:33] <robertmaxrees> that means your code isn't running after the markup then.
[16:55:36] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:55:44] <robertmaxrees> please don't send me credentials or a link...
[16:55:46] <al_nz1> a link I dont want to share publically
[16:55:58] <robertmaxrees> i could be sharing my logs publically ;)
[16:56:05] <al_nz1> nevermind then
[16:56:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't want it if it can't be sent to the channel :)
[16:56:52] <al_nz1> i got to go
[16:56:57] <al_nz1> thanks for your help anyway
[16:58:04] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) check out fixingthesejquery.com for a pretty good guide.
[16:58:11] <robertmaxrees> might give you some ideas.
[17:01:42] <jquery794> hello masters
[17:01:50] <robertmaxrees> lol "masters"
[17:01:50] <jquery794> i want to decode this
[17:01:53] <jquery794> $("#send_for_Aj").val($('#edit_content').html());
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> sure - where are you getting lost?
[17:02:25] <jquery794> in php i get ;&lt;p&gt;&lt;spa
[17:02:43] <jquery794> i need to decode this string ;&lt;p&gt;&lt;spa
[17:02:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, in php?
[17:03:04] <robertmaxrees> and you want to encode it, not decode :)
[17:03:20] <jquery794> can i fix it ?
[17:03:28] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:03:36] <jquery794> sample?
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not how we work here ;_)
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to change it in the php side or the js side?
[17:04:29] <jquery794> no i do post like it
[17:04:39] <jquery794> 	$emote = str_replace('<img align="absmiddle" alt=":trollface:" class="emoji" src="images/emoji/trollface.png" title=":trollface:"></img>',":trollface:",$emote); 	
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> that looks like php to me.
[17:04:58] <jquery794> and if i use html_decode
[17:05:01] <jquery794> from php
[17:05:07] <jquery794> i dont have emotic
[17:05:21] <jquery794> i need to decode string in js friest
[17:05:39] <robertmaxrees> *encode, it's already decoded.
[17:06:16] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[17:06:23] <robertmaxrees> this is what you'd use in the php side.
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> err, js side.
[17:06:30] <robertmaxrees> not php.
[17:06:31] <jquery794> oh i have this string ;&lt;p&gt;&lt;spa but this string coming from readable div
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> but i'd suggest using something from your php side instead.
[17:06:50] <jquery794> and this div dont give me correct text
[17:06:54] <jquery794> of string give me ;&lt;p&gt;&lt;spa
[17:07:07] <robertmaxrees> you're not paying attention to anything i'm saying lol.
[17:07:07] <jquery794> but i stop this string with strip_tags
[17:07:10] <robertmaxrees> i know what your issue is.
[17:07:25] <robertmaxrees> check out the link i sent.
[17:07:35] <jquery794> i check in over stackoverflow
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to pass the result of that .html call through it.
[17:08:34] <jquery794> overflow give me answer but i have value
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:08:47] <jquery794> var decoded = $('<div/>').html(data.description).text(); $('#gbFullPic').html(decoded);
[17:09:07] <robertmaxrees> hahaha that's another way to do it i guess.
[17:09:11] <robertmaxrees> i personally wouldn't but meh.
[17:09:15] <jquery794> that fix it but i have no div i have hidden textarea for post
[17:09:34] <robertmaxrees> so then apply that to your problem...
[17:09:54] <robertmaxrees> replace data.description with your html call and then pass decoded to that .val() call.
[17:10:24] <jquery794> i will try
[17:11:43] <jquery794> i try it
[17:11:48] <jquery794> var text__ =  $('#edit_content').html($('#edit_content').html().text());  $("#send_for_Aj").val(text__);
[17:11:51] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[17:11:54] <jquery794> but i have error
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use it.
[17:12:31] <jquery794> i post one isuse in git
[17:12:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> lol make a test case using jhsfiddle.
[17:14:53] <jquery794> https://github.com/raichophp/rkstyle.info/issues/3
[17:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle yo.
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> test case.
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> thx
[17:34:17] <altab> hello, how can I convert a number into a string?
[17:34:22] <robertmaxrees> .toString()
[17:34:29] <altab> thx!
[17:34:53] <taplar> hmm, wonder why some peeps do ""+ number
[17:35:08] <robertmaxrees> because they don't know any better/think it performs better/etc.
[17:35:12] <taplar> heh
[17:35:20] <taplar> would it be null safe?
[17:35:46] <robertmaxrees> that'll coerce anything to a string.
[17:35:56] <robertmaxrees> so "" + null would give you "null"
[17:36:01] <taplar> lol
[17:36:12] <taplar> i feel like that was probably in the WATT video
[17:36:33] <robertmaxrees> hah, probably.  the js type coercion system is kind of... weird.
[17:36:37] <robertmaxrees> and lol inducing,.
[17:37:31] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: back for 10 min before i get on my plane :)
[17:37:39] <robertmaxrees> 'kay?
[17:37:43] <robertmaxrees> you can ask the channel for help ;)_
[17:37:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only one here.
[17:37:56] <al_nz1> lol
[17:38:06] <al_nz1> you and taplar run this place :)
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:38:26] <taplar> in to da ground! yo!
[17:38:33] <robertmaxrees> we don't "run" it, people just highlight us and don't give others a chance to help.
[17:39:05] <al_nz1> I guess I need to know how to use the debugger so I can find why that jquery select statement isnt in the DOM
[17:39:19] <robertmaxrees> sure - so check out the guide i referenced you to.
[17:39:22] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery,com
[17:39:29] <robertmaxrees> err fixingthesejquery.com
[17:39:58] <al_nz1> yeah I have that site book marked
[17:40:03] <robertmaxrees> so use it.
[17:40:08] <robertmaxrees> it shows ytou how to use your debugger :)
[17:40:33] <al_nz1> but I have used the length statement, and put break points in
[17:40:39] <taplar> lol
[17:40:49] <al_nz1> and I can see the id works
[17:40:54] <al_nz1> but not the class selector
[17:40:56] <taplar> you don't have to put in the length if you use breakpoints
[17:41:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:41:03] <al_nz1> I dont know how to debug it beyond that
[17:41:05] <taplar> as the website will tell you, ^_^
[17:41:34] <al_nz1> slide 20 does say to use the length
[17:41:42] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, sure.
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> but refresh through it.
[17:41:48] <taplar> when your code hits a break point, you can do whatever
[17:41:49] <robertmaxrees> see if you get new ideas.
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> but set a breakpoint and then pop into your console.
[17:41:59] <taplar> you can stick the length in your console, rather than your code
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> search around.
[17:42:02] <taplar> or you can inspect them
[17:42:07] <taplar> different strokes
[17:42:16] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:42:19] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to play around.
[17:42:32] <al_nz1> yeah, actually I did that too yesertday. hit a break point and typed in some queryies into the console
[17:42:45] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you use one of the two classes?
[17:42:47] <al_nz1> it just bloody wont select .selectpicker.relationship
[17:42:52] <robertmaxrees> also: have you verified your markup is valid?
[17:43:00] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: good idea - will check that
[17:43:05] <al_nz1> darn
[17:43:09] <robertmaxrees> are you adding one of those classes dynamically?
[17:43:10] <al_nz1> got to get on this plane
[17:43:15] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically generating the markup?
[17:43:17] <robertmaxrees> etc. etc. etc.
[17:43:18] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: n
[17:43:20] <al_nz1> no
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> way too many variables here.
[17:43:22] <al_nz1> bbl
[17:43:23] <al_nz1> thanks
[17:43:26] <taplar> o.O you fixing to fly?
[17:43:56] * taplar queues lenny kravitz
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:51:10] <al_nz1> on the plane now lol
[17:52:37] <al_nz1> if I select '.selectpicker' I get 61 length
[17:52:40] <al_nz1> so thats working
[17:52:59] <al_nz1> but if I add .selectpicker.relationship it falls over
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> what about .relationship ?
[17:53:29] <al_nz1> relationship doesnt have to actually be a css class does it? it can just be used for jquery purposes?
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as "a css class"  html has classesd.
[17:53:49] <robertmaxrees> css and js can both use them.
[17:54:48] <robertmaxrees> as long as the class attribute of that element actually contains those two strings, you're fine.
[17:54:53] <al_nz1> no it wont pickup relationship
[17:54:57] <al_nz1> on its own either
[17:55:10] <al_nz1> gets it as a ID tho
[17:55:14] <al_nz1> hmm
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> so try this.
[17:55:30] <robertmaxrees> can you inspect the element?
[17:56:12] <al_nz1> as in right click on the selectpicker and hit Q (FF)
[17:56:18] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:56:44] <al_nz1> yip
[17:56:50] <al_nz1> it goes to the bootstrap button class
[17:57:09] <robertmaxrees> lol you'll probably need to poke around the html a bit.
[17:57:17] <al_nz1> damn it I need to take off now
[17:57:31] <al_nz1> it should still select the correct html though
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> not with bootstrap.
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> bs changes trhings around a bunch
[17:57:57] <taplar> $('.selectpicker').each(function(){ console.log(this.className); });
[17:58:35] <al_nz1> but in terms of $(".relationship" it exists as a class in the html
[17:58:35] <al_nz1> even if the picker itself picks something else
[17:58:35] <al_nz1> gtg
[17:58:36] <al_nz1> take off :-)
[17:59:33] <taplar> so sad
[17:59:38] <taplar> he's leaving.... on a jet plane
[17:59:49] <taplar> dunno, when he'll... be back.... again
[18:00:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:01:34] <taplar> oh babe.... is it ok if i cal you babe?  cool...   oh babe!  i.... hate to go
[18:01:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:01:43] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[18:05:03] <taplar> man, got that stuck in my head now
[18:05:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry to hear.
[18:05:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:35:07] <bonks> Is there a way to get the first text node of an element?
[18:35:34] <bonks> Is there a selector* I should ask
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check out https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> no selector.
[18:38:12] <bonks> robertmaxrees: Ok that helps read, but I'm trying to overwrite the text field by assigning a new string... but it's not updating the dom
[18:38:21] <bonks> How do I set a value?
[18:38:36] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying.
[18:40:42] <bonks> $("<span>Header<span>Actions</span></span>").contents()[0] = 'New Header'
[18:42:13] <robertmaxrees> no way to update that markup i take it?
[18:42:27] <bonks> Correct
[18:43:14] <bonks> I'm trying to update kendo UI's pivot table column names after databound, since it doesn't have options to overwrite display names
[18:43:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ygowhjmf/
[18:44:28] <robertmaxrees> need to use .textContent
[18:45:09] <user_corrupt> when I select something from the following dropdown, I get nothing. https://jsfiddle.net/mgh9d74e/7/ The second time that I select something, I get the output that I was trying to get the first time (id of selected element). If I select something a third time, then I get the output that I was looking for the second time. What gives?
[18:45:59] <robertmaxrees> global var with the wrong event probably.
[18:46:11] <bonks> robertmaxrees: Sweet! That worked. Thanks man!
[18:46:57] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mgh9d74e/8/
[18:54:32] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: Thanks. Any idea how I can fix it when it's an AJAX call that calls a function like this? https://paste.ee/p/VK16S
[18:54:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:55:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue there?
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean the event handler isn't firint at all?
[19:18:10] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: actually, it fires, but it has the same behaviour as the fiddle
[19:22:31] <al_nz1> im back....
[19:22:51] <al_nz1> So using jquery selectors with bootstrap....
[19:23:05] <al_nz1> bootstrap changes things?
[19:23:15] <al_nz1> can anyone explain how
[19:23:42] <al_nz1> I have installed Firebug and can inspect my dropdown element wth it
[19:25:31] <al_nz1> which takes me not to <select class="selectpicker relationship".... but to <button class="btn dropdown-toggle
[19:26:52] <al_nz1> ahhh i see now
[19:27:00] <al_nz1> the html is completely changed
[19:27:04] <al_nz1> shit
[19:41:42] <user_corrupt> I have an AJAX request that calls a function to open a dropdown in its callback: https://paste.ee/p/VK16S Below those, I have a listener console logging the id of selected drop down elements. My problem is that the first time it fires, it gives me no id. The second time it fires, it gives me the id I was supposed to get the first time, etc. What gives?
[20:37:55] <danielmetlitski> I can't for the life of me figure out how to rotate my image around the center point I can't seem to get it working
[20:38:18] <danielmetlitski> lines 25-29 https://gist.github.com/linkslip/6caf4859fd182a991e40e697a5074fae I think I have the wrong values in ctx.translate, but don't know which ones to use
[21:35:37] <SlizardWizard> I have a bunch of input validators that are bound to on change events to inputs, I also have some js code which adds more inputs. How can i bind those same input validators to the new inputs without rebinding the original inputs
[21:35:51] <SlizardWizard> I have several ideas, but i am not sure which one is more correct
[23:17:30] <SlizardWizard> is anyone ever here?
