[00:02:36] <serge> RockinAkin, are you talking to me?
[00:03:00] <RockinAkin> nope
[00:03:05] <RockinAkin> got my own problems
[00:06:10] <naschine> RockinAkin: use a dropdown instead? Or validate the input to only values you allow... Or make the input only use4r readable and fill it via your function...
[00:06:33] <naschine> RockinAkin: possibly there are a lot more options you could use to achieve what you want
[00:07:01] <RockinAkin> well
[00:07:13] <RockinAkin> i could use a range input as well
[00:09:00] <RockinAkin> oh shit
[00:09:11] <RockinAkin> just thought up an idea
[00:09:15] <RockinAkin> thx
[01:46:18] <VectorX> is there a $( document ).ready() {} sort of thing for modifying the html before it is rendered in the browser ?
[01:57:48] <Amnesia> question, is .unload() deprecated? https://api.jquery.com/unload/
[01:58:31] <Amnesia> oh fail, version deprecated: 1.8
[01:58:34] <Amnesia> %.$
[02:02:09] <Amnesia> hm, what's the current mainstream way to bind a handler to an unload event?
[02:03:01] <the_last> Hi guys. I've got an ajax request the fetches a HTML string, like: <div class="video">...</div><div class="video">...</div>, and I want to count the number of "video" divs there are as soon as I retrieve the HTML from the server. Is there an easy way to do this? I tried: .done(function(data) { $(data).find('.video').length --- but it returns 0.
[02:06:55] <Jattenalle> the_last, count = ajaxresponse.match(/class="video"/g); ?
[02:06:59] <Jattenalle> or somesuch regex magic
[02:07:07] * Jattenalle sucks at regex, might need cleaning up
[02:07:17] <Jattenalle> then just do a count.length

[02:13:33] <joris_> Hi. Anyone remember how pre-1.9, one would disable cookie storage for jquery-ui Tabs ?

[02:15:03] <Axman6> 'lo all, what's the easiest way to replace one class of an element with another? the answer I've seen on stackoverflow is to use a regular expression, but this seems less than ideal
[02:15:46] <Axman6> so, bsically I want to replace something that looks like btn-\w+ with something else
[02:19:50] <krambiorix> anyone?
[02:21:11] <seutje> krambiorix: the +1
[02:21:24] <seutje> '0' + numer = string
[02:21:31] <seutje> string + 1 = 'bla1'
[02:22:18] <seutje> js> print('0' + 17 + 1)
[02:22:24] <b-ot> seutje: 0171
[02:24:23] <soee> how can i find element by data attribute with  given value ?
[02:26:52] <seutje> $('[data-foo="bar"]') but it's not very performant, so might wanna narrow it down to a class or something
[02:27:19] <Amnesia> seutje: what's the current best practice to bind a handler to the unload event (or w/e event is triggered when someone leaves the page)? I've tried $(window).bind('unload', function() { return 'foobar'; }); but that doesn't pop up a box at all.
[02:27:24] <Amnesia> I'm using ff 29.0.1 btw
[02:27:45] <seutje> it's onbeforeunload, ins't it?
[02:27:49] <seutje> `mdn onbeforeunload
[02:27:51] <b-ot> seutje: window.onbeforeunload - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onbeforeunload
[02:28:24] <the_last> Jattenalle: .filter('.video').length works :D
[02:28:30] <seutje> yeah, so just $(window).on('beforeunload', ... I suppose
[02:28:39] <Jattenalle> the_last, ah, taht's much more elegant :3
[02:28:50] <the_last> Jattenalle: yeah, thanks though
[02:30:55] <Amnesia> seutje: ty, I'm unable to specify the text for the popup box though, from what I've found on the net, the function should return the string that should be shown
[02:37:50] <Koopz> this is weird... i have 2 tables... i use datatables on both... but the second one only resizes it's columns when reloading the page
[02:38:57] <ussher_> Koopz: (guess) check for duplicate ids
[02:39:16] <Koopz> IDs?
[02:39:45] <Koopz> the ones generated by DataTables?
[02:39:52] <ussher_>  id="something" <div id="something">
[02:40:02] <Koopz> DataTables_Table_0 and DataTables_Table_1
[02:41:11] <Koopz> $('.vorgaenge, .scheine').dataTable(); I use their classes for initiating them.
[02:41:42] <Koopz> had two calls before... same result
[02:42:49] <Koopz> i could try defining the columns in the call... maybe that helps...
[02:43:38] <seutje> Amnesia: yeah sorry, not much more I can tell you than https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/beforeunload
[02:43:52] <seutje> never used it myself and plan to keep it that way, if possible :P
[02:44:08] <Amnesia> heh
[02:44:30] <Amnesia> ty once again for your assistance!
[02:44:38] <Amnesia> I'm finally getting a hang of js \o/
[02:44:52] <Amnesia> actually using jquery's dead easy^^
[02:45:02] <seutje> INORITE?
[02:45:04] <Amnesia> (and I'm a fscking noob..)
[02:45:20] <seutje> until you go big and it all becomes spaghetti :D
[02:45:43] <Amnesia> most likely:P
[02:45:56] <Amnesia> and I bet using raw js without jquery is quite a pita
[02:46:23] <seutje> it's mostly useful for DOM manipulation and event/ajax stuff
[02:46:50] <Amnesia> jquery or javascript?
[02:46:51] <seutje> but it doesn't provide structure or anything
[02:46:54] <seutje> jQuery
[02:47:00] <Amnesia> true
[02:47:49] <seutje> but hey man, javascript is going to mars! http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/4041 :P
[02:47:58] <seutje> or at least, if they can fill that position
[02:48:24] <Amnesia> ^^
[02:48:34] <Amnesia> I bet it's already running at ISS
[02:57:46] <Koopz> meh... the second table still doesn't get resized...
[03:00:56] <papifabi>     var obj={};
[03:00:56] <papifabi>     $.extend(true,obj,$.allData); is very slow,better way do to a deepcopy ?
[03:01:18] <Koopz> switched the tables... second one is now first... also tried initiating the table before the other... it still doesn't want to resize automatically... wtf is wrong with it...
[03:07:20] <dokma> how do I write a func that can be invoked like $('sel').myFunc() ?

[03:13:52] <VectorX> is there a $( document ).ready() {} sort of thing for modifying the html before it is rendered in the browser ?
[03:14:06] <VectorX> beside using ajax, to change the response itself
[03:17:42] <seutje> u mean execute javascript before there's javascript to be executed?
[03:18:20] <seutje> scripts in the head are executed, but u can't change the document.body as it isn't there yet
[03:18:43] <seutje> you can document.write, but people might stab you in your sleep for that
[03:19:32] <seutje> you could prevent stuff from rendering and alter it once it's ready and then allow it to be rendered...
[03:20:18] <bee_keeper> what's the recommended way to toggle a click function since toggle was removed in 1.8?  can obviously use and if/else but is there a nicer way i'm missing?
[03:28:36] <mento> hi guys, i cant seem to get my little script working on the latest jquery version. I cant figure out how to fix it. I assume it has to do with the toggle function. http://jsfiddle.net/L4L8M/ It works fine this way on 1.8.3 but i need it to get it working on 1.11.1
[03:46:03] <hollaballers> hey there guys I got an $.ajax request and I want on success function if not before to return certain rows of data. so my json looks like {title: title1, id: 1, title: title2: title2, id: 2} how can i pull only title for example and not id
[03:51:45] <skynxnex> hollaballers: is that valid json?
[03:52:06] <hollaballers> its an example skynxnex
[03:52:26] <papifabi> withotu a copy,i don't know :s
[03:52:30] <hollaballers> so from what is returned from the ajaxrequest i watn to actually filter it down to 2-3 specific things for each item
[03:54:07] <skynxnex> so i'm guessing you are using a foreach loop of sorts?
[03:54:49] <systemfault> hollaballers: I'd use $.map
[03:54:52] <hollaballers> no not at all
[03:55:27] <systemfault> $.map(data, function() { return this.title; })
[03:55:31] <hollaballers> ah thx systemfault so i should use map for the array that is returned
[03:56:05] <systemfault> Yeah, just assign the returned array from $.map to some variable
[03:56:21] <hollaballers> ah nice thx
[03:56:24] <hollaballers> :)
[03:56:36] <mogaj> am unable to get checked radio button value ... the code works fine in jsfiddle but not in my project no errors are arising
[03:57:00] <BinaryKitten> systemfault urm $.map?
[03:57:22] <BinaryKitten> ah from an ajax request response..
[03:57:24] <BinaryKitten> gotcha
[03:57:28] <systemfault> BinaryKitten: :)
[03:57:45] <BinaryKitten> was thinking it was from something else like links or something
[03:58:05] <BinaryKitten> that would be $('linkcollection').map(function() { return this.title; }).get()
[03:58:39] <systemfault> BinaryKitten: For $.fn.map, yes
[03:58:59] <systemfault> $.map is more like a utility function
[03:59:06] <mento> hi guys, i cant seem to get my little script working on the latest jquery version. I cant figure out how to fix it. I assume it has to do with the toggle function. http://jsfiddle.net/L4L8M/ It works fine this way on 1.8.3 but i need it to get it working on 1.11.1
[04:04:54] <BinaryKitten> mento http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/deprecated-1.8/
[04:05:08] <BinaryKitten> basically the toggle code is not valid
[04:08:14] <BinaryKitten> mento: http://jsfiddle.net/L4L8M/2/
[04:11:30] <mento> BinaryKitten: thanks for the heads up
[04:33:00] <paulvd> i want to remove a div before a div, but not happening ? http://jsfiddle.net/XL46K/
[04:41:08] <papifabi> $('#last-footer-widget').prev().remove(); ?
[04:41:23] <seutje> paulvd: it is removing it for me
[04:41:38] <papifabi> me too
[04:42:08] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/XL46K/1/
[04:43:02] <dokma> would function poll() { $.ajax({ success: function() { poll(); } }); } cause recursive calling of poll or not due to the fact that it is async?
[04:45:28] <seutje> guess sit would re-ajax until the end of time or until it doesn't succeed
[04:45:33] <seutje> guess it*
[04:48:38] <papifabi> so,i will re-port: how do fast deepcopy of an object ?
[04:49:25] <papifabi> .extend or json.stringify ?
[04:49:55] <skynxnex> or clone?
[04:50:36] <papifabi> someone tested yet ? my object is bit big,so it is slow :(
[04:52:01] <wartdev> Try with CIRC using chrome its very good!
[04:52:13] <wartdev> papifabi
[04:52:28] <slax0r> irssi > bitchx > every other client

[05:11:36] <seutje> oh man, 1.2.6? that's like 6 years ago ;x
[05:12:30] <Lurzino> Hello everyone !!!!! :-))))))
[05:13:18] <Hamzar> seutje it doesn't matter i can update the jquery soure to the last one
[05:13:23] <seutje> Hamzar: is the server configirated for it?
[05:13:28] <seutje> configurated*
[05:13:41] <Hamzar> seutje gulfup.com use the same files
[05:13:50] <Hamzar> 1.2.6
[05:13:52] <Hamzar> and all
[05:14:16] <seutje> well yeah, the plugin is also 6 years old, so updating ur jQueries will make it explode, most likely
[05:14:25] <Hamzar> but the way im asking about the simplest way to add the progress bar with percent don't matter wich method i use
[05:14:46] <seutje> well, u need to setup the server for it as well afaict
[05:15:04] <Hamzar> can you go with me step by step to add the progress bar all things
[05:15:06] <Hamzar> plz
[05:15:11] <Lurzino> I need a little direction: I have this piece of code at http://pastebin.com/CCEgACcq and I'd like to understand how I could catch the adiacent div so I can change the background color on hover?.... I thought with parent() I should catch the upper div then with next() I should catch the adiacent div but it doesn't working.... maybe I missed something.... any idea?
[05:15:15] <Lurzino> thanks in advance
[05:15:17] <Lurzino> :)
[05:15:58] <decx> parent relates to event-template
[05:16:02] <seutje> Hamzar: oh, I have no clue, I just know the server needs to be set up to provide progress steps
[05:16:09] <decx> and event-light isnt next to event-template
[05:16:36] <Hamzar> don't matter about server side i need just to fix the jquery
[05:16:38] <decx> get rid of the parent().next and use $(this).prev('.even-light')
[05:16:46] <decx> *event*
[05:17:30] <Lurzino> hmmm decx then how I could catch the adiacent?
[05:18:01] <decx> like i wrote, event-light is before event-wrapper so use prev
[05:18:09] <decx> this can also be done with css only
[05:18:29] <decx> or maybe it cant because light is before wrapper
[05:18:49] <Lurzino> decx with css I already tried using .event-light:hover + .event-wrapper but id didn't worked
[05:18:56] <Lurzino> yeah because its before
[05:20:14] <decx> well i meant with the ~ sibling selector but same problem
[05:20:26] <Lurzino> with prev() it works
[05:20:28] <Lurzino> thanks al ot
[05:20:31] <Lurzino> *a lot
[05:20:32] <Lurzino> :)
[05:21:20] <decx> it really doesnt make sense that .item:hover ~ .item2 css doesnt work when item2 is before item
[05:21:39] <seutje> Hamzar: sorry man, don't see anything obviously wrong here, but I've never used this plugin
[05:21:57] <Hamzar> thanks man seutje
[05:22:16] <seutje> might be interesting to look for a more recently updated project like https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[05:22:27] <seutje> at least that one has been looked at in the past 6 years :P
[05:25:26] <serge_> Hi. I realy need a help with jQueryUI sortable. Here is what I currently have http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/6JjpU/3/ A problem described at jsfiddle. Thanks.
[05:30:29] <mdev> looping through radio buttons with $('input:radio').each(function()
[05:30:42] <mdev> how can I check the value
[05:30:51] <mdev> if($(this).value
[05:30:53] <mdev> or what?
[05:32:42] <systemfault> .val()
[05:32:43] <b-ot> systemfault: for form fields
[05:39:04] <mdev> THANKS
[05:42:03] <mdev> the code is
[05:42:05] <mdev> <td  valign="middle"><input name="Search" type="radio"
[05:42:14] <mdev> but $('input:radio').each(function() {
[05:42:17] <mdev> not listing it
[05:42:50] <mdev> <td  valign="middle" width=35%><input name="Search" type="radio" value="Alpha"  onClick="JavaScript:selectPEBSearch(document.pebPostLogin)"
[05:42:51] <mdev> actually
[05:43:24] <xec> o.O
[05:43:54] <mdev> console.log('Radio Value "'+$(this).val()+'"...');
[05:43:59] <mdev> isn't showing anything
[05:44:09] <mdev> so loop not finding jack, so confused
[05:44:13] <mdev> been at this for like an hour
[05:45:12] <xec> mdev: i dunno wtf you're doing onclick="whateverthehell" but it should still work
[05:45:14] <xec> mdev: http://jsfiddle.net/YfCE5/
[05:45:28] <xec> but uh
[05:45:37] <xec> no nevermind
[05:46:11] <xec> $(this).val() is just the jquery way of doing .value on a native dom element
[05:46:18] <xec> which is what i did in that demo
[05:47:01] <mdev> this.value got it
[05:47:03] <mdev> thank you
[05:47:22] <mdev> you da man!
[05:47:49] <xec> mdev: $(this).val() would work just the same http://jsfiddle.net/YfCE5/1/
[05:48:45] <mdev> well it doesn't for some reason
[05:48:51] <mdev> but this.value does
[05:49:16] <seutje> works for me
[05:49:24] <xec> i just showed you that it does :P if it doesn't in your code maybe you have a typo elsewhere?
[05:49:57] <mdev> yeah is probably something else
[05:55:13] <dystie> Evening :) If I have a prototype containing multiple functions inside, and call one of them from another event (ie click).... how can I access the prototype function inside? this.FooFunction points back to the calling event.
[06:00:40] <daschel> Im mostly a backend developer, and im a bit confused by some behavior on the frontend.  so I have a question about jquery, specifically event handling with the jquery-UI.  Im using datepicker(), and when a date is first selected, I want the calendar to slide left to show a form.  That works fine unless the previous/next month elements are clicked first.  Then nothing happens. It's like the event listener is being overridden.  Could someone e
[06:00:40] <daschel> xplain to me what is going on?  Here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/HM9ea/
[06:06:18] <AL13N_work> i'm having a strange behavior
[06:11:59] <AL13N_work> i'm doing a ajax call and when i specify username, it doesn't send a request in my firefox, if i don't, it sends an OPTIONS... why is this?
[06:12:30] <AL13N_work> using beforeSend or headers without username does send OPTIONS
[06:12:57] <AL13N_work> i don't get why there is a difference?
[06:13:31] <AL13N_work> it's like jquery or xhr just doesn't do an ajax call if you need basic auth
[06:13:33] <AL13N_work> or something
[06:14:09] <dystie> options contains your data most likely, a serialised array
[06:14:35] <AL13N_work> no, the OPTIONS is the preflight for CrossDomain
[06:14:51] <AL13N_work> but if i specify username field in the ajax settings, the OPTIONS doesn't happen
[06:15:46] <AL13N_work> i don't understand why
[06:17:19] <systemfault> AL13N_work: Just add the header yourself.
[06:33:50] <mdev> <select name="state" class="input"
[06:34:01] <mdev> how can I set that combobox's value, using its name
[06:34:18] <mdev> been googlign but haven't found anything yet or have but confusing
[06:34:34] <BillCriswell> mdev: $('select[name=state]').val('PA')
[06:34:48] <BillCriswell> That's an attribute selector there.
[06:35:19] <mdev> you're a superstar thanks
[06:35:32] <BillCriswell> mdev: You could also use $('.input').val('PA'); but I doubt that's the only input class in your document.

[07:19:14] <aababe> decx: newcomments = 1
[07:26:46] <dokma> I've misunderstood something here:  paras = $.parseHTML('<p>para1</><p>para2</p>'); paras.each(function() { console.log($this); });
[07:27:08] <dokma> shouldn't $.parseHTML give me something I should be able to .each ?
[07:28:46] <systemfault> dokma: No, it only parses HTML
[07:28:55] <systemfault> dokma: So $(paras).each(function()......
[07:29:20] <dokma> systemfault, so do I need $.parseHTML at all?
[07:29:24] <iceiceice_> website http://www.stockholmhealth.se, name = admin, pw = adminadmin. the last section doesnt get "scrolled", '3rspage' - it did just seconds ago, not sure what i did.
[07:30:13] <systemfault> dokma: Depends on your version of jQuery… I'm not sure now. With 1.9, you needed it.
[07:30:24] <systemfault> dokma: If the markup was not "perfect"
[07:31:03] <systemfault> I think they relaxed $(htmlHere) after 1.9 so I'm not sure anymore.
[07:32:24] <Jattenalle> iceiceice_, yo, you never close <div class="section" id="section1">
[07:32:34] <Jattenalle> <div class="section" id="section2"> is inside section1 ^^
[07:33:59] <iceiceice_> Jattenalle: ah... do i feel like an idiot. thanks man appreciate it
[07:34:08] <Jattenalle> np, lycka till
[07:34:39] <aababe> why after running this jquery does the blueCommentsSpan dissappear and functionality of dropdown stops?
[07:34:40] <aababe> http://hastebin.com/okuqivovan.xml
[07:45:39] <BillCriswell>  This project is using the / at the end of empty elements. It feels so dirty to me having to type it lol
[07:47:38] <AL13N_work> feeling dirty is something that people get used to quite fast
[07:49:05] <drej> IM DIRTY
[07:49:16] <beancurd> SO DIRTY
[07:49:37] <BillCriswell> drej: You do the dirty <img /> in HTML5?
[07:49:48] <drej> you know what the dirtiest thing is that i do in html5 ?
[07:49:53] <drej> <a href=""><div>...</div></a>
[07:49:54] <drej> shudder
[07:50:06] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's a hard thing to get used to haha.
[07:50:25] <BillCriswell> I never really got why I can't just put href="" on whatever element I wanted.
[07:50:33] <drej> BillCriswell there was a ton of debate on that
[07:50:37] <beancurd> wow, so dirty.
[07:50:38] <drej> it came down to backwards compatibility
[07:50:52] <aababe> it makes me feel dirty....and not the good kind of dirty
[07:50:52] <drej> older browsers would break if they saw that
[07:51:04] <BillCriswell> drej: Ah, that stinks.
[07:51:21] <drej> yeah, i was really hoping that they'd go with that approach as well
[07:51:29] <drej> it was heavily contested and there was a lot of backing for it
[07:51:38] <drej> but it would just break too much of the current implementations to make sense
[07:52:27] <BillCriswell> I could understand the "links" not working but why wouldn't older browsers just ignore the attribute  all together?
[07:52:46] <drej> i dont remember specifically, i do remember reading it and going "oh, well yeah, that makes sense"
[07:53:03] <BillCriswell> Haha
[07:53:55] <drej> well i mean, off the bat, you would have to do fallbacks for older browsers somehow
[07:53:58] <drej> thats the first issue
[07:54:06] <drej> because they wouldnt support it, so you'd have to polyfill it and suppliment it
[07:54:11] <drej> and i think it just wasnt "worth it"
[07:54:13] <drej> or something i dont remember
[07:54:27] <BillCriswell> Yeah, oh well it's still awesome.
[07:54:35] <drej> totes
[07:54:36] <BillCriswell> The <a> tag changed the world.
[07:54:43] <drej> brought world peace and all
[07:55:31] <dystie> $.proxy . You are amazing, jquery.
[08:04:55] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, i still do <br/> out of habbit.. i've tried to learn.. but alas..
[08:05:15] <drej> blasphemy
[08:05:26] <drej> why do you have <br>s to begin with
[08:05:40] <BillCriswell> drej: Writing poems.
[08:05:45] <Jattenalle> you know, come to think of it, i only ever really use them to output debug..
[08:05:45] <Jattenalle> huh
[08:06:00] <drej> BillCriswell love me some poems
[08:06:00] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Yeah, some habits are hard to <br>.
[08:06:04] <drej> ahaha
[08:06:08] <Jattenalle> what you did there, i observed it.
[08:06:10] <Jattenalle> and smirked.
[08:06:15] <systemfault> Poems and addresses are valid uses of <br>
[08:06:48] <marc_v92> And static designs that require line breaks at specific spots in a line.
[08:06:56] <drej> systemfault not even addresses
[08:07:08] <drej> or i guess .... maybe
[08:07:22] <drej> i normally use <address> with <spans> and microformats
[08:07:34] <systemfault> drej: That's what I do
[08:07:38] <Jattenalle> <div> all the things!
[08:07:50] <Jattenalle> if it's not 50 layers deep, it's not <div> enough!
[08:07:53] <axilla> aaargh....
[08:08:03] <systemfault> drej: I just think that breaks in an address are not stylistic.
[08:08:06] <drej> <div class="table"><div class="row"><div class="cell">WELCOME TO MY SITE</div></div></div>
[08:08:18] <Jattenalle> drej, with inline style="" on each one :D
[08:08:28] <docmur> If I have the value of a select box using:  myselect.options[myselect.selectedIndex].value  and I want to send that in $.post() to a file updateView.php, what is the correct method?
[08:08:29] <drej> systemfault well , there's some argument that the line breaks could be different on different devices
[08:08:44] <systemfault> drej: I guess :)
[08:08:57] <drej> like, postal code could be crammed on the same line as province/country
[08:09:09] <drej> but could also be on its own line if you have the space
[08:09:34] <systemfault> drej: I think coutry-specific standards exist for addresses
[08:09:50] <systemfault> You don't get to choose where to break if you follow them
[08:09:54] <drej> there are some general guidelines, you're right
[08:09:58] <drej> but even within that there are variables
[08:10:03] <Jattenalle> US addresses always throw me off
[08:10:11] <Jattenalle> with the prince, region, state, crap
[08:10:15] <Jattenalle> province*
[08:10:27] <aababe> why is it that if i use jquery to show an element that is by default display none, then all the sub elements in that one are suddenly removed?
[08:10:29] <drej> province is not US :)
[08:11:12] <Jattenalle> drej, well i meant more the idea of it, not the actual thing ;).. ie: 123 Road, Place [newline] Otherplace, Biggerplace [newline] USA
[08:11:15] <Jattenalle> so much place!
[08:11:43] <drej> where are you from ?
[08:11:49] <drej> or rather what are you comparing it to
[08:11:51] <Sengoku> Anyone know jquery datatables? If so, can I init a table footer row using the lib?
[08:11:52] <marc_v92> Jattenalle: I’ve sent packages to the US quite a few times. All you need is 123 Street Rd, City, State, 90210
[08:11:55] <Jattenalle> the glorious socialist empire of sweden
[08:12:09] <Jattenalle> marc_v92, aye, it just throws me off
[08:12:35] <drej> in sweden, when you mail something you just put "Send it to Sven" on the envelope
[08:12:36] <drej> and then its fine
[08:12:43] <Jattenalle> here in sweden it's just: Street <br> 12345 City
[08:12:47] <Jattenalle> well, and name, of course
[08:13:06] <marc_v92> Jattenalle: I guess I’m just confused by what throws you off, lol. Most countries in the world are separated into provinces or states.
[08:13:25] <Jattenalle> the number is the privince/region code here
[08:13:44] <Jattenalle> so we only have two lines for address, while US is usually three (unless you just comma separate it, of course)
[08:14:06] <Jattenalle> Name <br> Street 12 <br> 12345 City
[08:14:36] <marc_v92> Jattenalle: That makes sense. At first, I thought you specifically meant US addresses, lol. Cause USA, Canada, UK, Russia, China, etc. etc. all have provinces (or states or regions or whatever they choose to call them)
[08:14:46] <thaifood> hi
[08:14:56] <Jattenalle> marc_v92, nah, it's just US is the one i'm usually sending to.. always have to do a double take :)
[08:14:57] <thebope> hey
[08:15:28] <thaifood> I'm trying to hide drop down options in a select but it doesn't work in IE11.  Any alternatives to this please?  $("#ch2").find('option[value=' + $("#ch1").val() +']').hide();
[08:15:38] <marc_v92> Jattenalle: Haha, yeah, I hear ya. :) Though I think it will still get where it needs to without the State/Province, since postal codes/zip codes are unique across the country.
[08:15:58] <Jattenalle> when you're sending contracts around you dont want to risk it :P
[08:16:22] <decx> hiding an option doesnt seem valid thaifood , do .prop('disabled',true) instead
[08:16:44] <thaifood> where do i put the val in that so it can find the one to disable ?
[08:17:11] <decx> same way you tried to hide?
[08:17:19] <thaifood> thx !
[08:17:27] <thaifood> i'm on to you decx !
[08:17:38] <Jattenalle> wait, what?
[08:17:54] <decx> you're right, i'm just guessing here
[08:19:04] <thaifood> that works, thanks so much decx !
[08:19:06] <drej> Jattenalle who uses snail mail for contracts ?
[08:19:23] <Jattenalle> drej, anyone who wants to be able to properly enforce them :P
[08:19:35] <drej> you can enforce a digital signature these days
[08:19:40] <BillCriswell> I love sass meister.
[08:19:51] <Jattenalle> drej, it's still untested in most courts
[08:20:00] <Jattenalle> until there's been a proper court case = nope.
[08:20:02] <drej> ive enforced a digital signature in small claims court in the past
[08:20:11] <drej> when a client didnt pay
[08:20:19] <Jattenalle> yeah, it works in (some?) parts of the US, and in some EU countries
[08:20:35] <drej> im in canadia
[08:20:43] <drej> i mean i could've been lucky
[08:20:52] * Jattenalle shrugs
[08:21:01] <Jattenalle> could work just fine in canada for all i know :)
[08:21:11] <Jattenalle> paper is just the safer bet for international, still
[08:21:19] <drej> probably, yeah
[08:21:46] <Jattenalle> also, paper contracts tend to weed out the idiots when you're looking for artists/programmers/whatever
[08:22:25] <Jattenalle> "Gosh, do I have to send this back?" -"Yeah..." -"Geez, guess I'll ask mom to drive me.. " -"Wait, you said you were 30?" -"Uh, yeah totally.. uh.. i'm 15"
[08:24:54] <decx> better yet: "Geez, guess I'll ask mom to drive me.. " -"Wait, you said you were 30?" -"I am"
[08:25:33] <ontime> Hello everyone.  I'm proficient with html and css, but not with JS.  When you click on an anchored link, it will take you to the anchor on another page (or even the same).  The selected class will be highlighted and it will auto scroll to this position on the page.  The link is here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/highlighting-content-based-on-clicked-anchor-from-another-page  --- Thanks in advance.
[08:25:50] <Jattenalle> decx, hey, then they can still enter into the contract :P
[08:25:51] <ontime> I really have no clue how to make that code work.
[08:26:06] <Jattenalle> decx, and if they live at home, you know they have the time to spare ;)
[08:26:39] <decx> ontime window.location.hash can be used to target the right cell
[08:27:00] <decx> hehe i guess Jattenalle
[08:27:54] <ontime> Thank you decx.  I still have no idea how to actually implement that code.  I am not very familiar with javascript.
[08:28:40] <ontime> They do not show a working example on the link I sent you to, and I didn't find anything else on the net about it.  Maybe I'm not using the right keywords.
[08:29:32] <ontime> in any event, if you (decx) or someone else could please explain how it works and possibly a working example.  If I had a working example, I would see exactly how it needs to be implemented.
[08:29:42] <ontime> Thanks in advance.
[08:29:48] <bumbar> i can't see the error, https://dpaste.de/X77V
[08:32:09] <decx> ontime http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ka495/show/#myhash
[08:32:25] <ontime> thank you decx.  I'm very grateful.
[08:32:43] <decx> this is the most primitive way
[08:34:52] <aababe> if i use 					var newCommentsDiv = $('#new-comments-notification'); then can i use 						newCommentsDiv.find('inactive').text('New Comments');  ?
[08:35:16] <decx> this finds an inactive tag which doesnt exist
[08:35:27] <decx> maybe you mean .inactive?
[08:35:33] <decx> for a class
[08:35:34] <aababe> decx: yes
[08:35:51] <decx> either way yea that'll do
[08:36:16] <aababe> decx: aaaaand it works.
[08:37:30] <ontime> Awesome.  That's what I'm looking for.  This will auto scroll to the location of this id?  The autoscroll should be smooth as well.  Listen, decx, I'll trade services, free hosting and email accounts, if you can help me get this all figured out.
[08:40:45] <decx> leave the scrolling to the browser it automatically does that for hashs
[08:41:26] <AL13N_work> when doing ajax calls, is there a way i can get the basic authentication poped up like regular links?
[08:41:33] <decx> ontime here's a more robust example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ka495/7/
[08:41:48] <ontime> well, yes, I actually never liked the feathered autoscroll because it will cause slower machines to be less responsive.   You're right, decx.
[08:41:51] <AL13N_work> right now the calls just fail with 401
[08:42:39] <systemfault> AL13N_work: The popup should appear if you send the proper header from the server WWW-Authenticate
[08:43:09] <ontime> decx, thanks for helping me with this.
[08:43:14] <AL13N_work> systemfault: if i do the GET myself, the popup appears, but with ajax, it doesn't appear
[08:44:04] <systemfault> AL13N_work: Ah, perhaps that changed… before, if the server sent a WWW-Authenticate header + 401, you'd get the popup even with ajax
[08:44:05] <decx> ontime np, just remember #jquery is best channel in the world, all the other channels are run by little girls
[08:44:11] <AL13N_work> hmm, maybe i can try with jsonp
[08:44:30] <systemfault> AL13N_work: Not sure how you're going to do auth with jsonp… since it's not ajax
[08:44:47] <ontime> haha @ decx.  It's cool when you're here, at least.
[08:44:49] <AL13N_work> jsonp is a type you can set in the .ajax() call
[08:45:00] <AL13N_work> wasn't sure how it would be done
[08:45:16] <decx> thanks to my bnc i'm always here even if i'm not ontime so it's always cool ^^
[08:46:31] <ontime> decx, bcn?
[08:47:07] <AL13N_work> systemfault: wtf, that actually works
[08:47:49] <systemfault> AL13N_work: You must be doing some weird stuff..
[08:48:20] <decx> it's a separate thing that relays me to several irc networks and stays online ontime
[08:49:27] <ontime> oh, I see, decx.  thanks for explaining.
[08:49:45] <slax0r> you're soo cool

My code is http://paste2.org/VVpWyvc8. Any suggestions?
[10:10:42] <duch_kazatel> dp do you have jquery loaded?
[10:10:51] <dp> duch_kazatel: yes.
[10:11:07] <duch_kazatel> can you fiddle that up then?
[10:11:19] <dp> let me try; one second
[10:13:16] <dp> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Z7fTJ/
[10:17:44] <duch_kazatel> yep - 1.6.4 - that's your issue.
[10:17:53] <duch_kazatel> why are you using such an old version of jquery?\
[10:17:55] <thoraxe> so i'm not a js guy, and just hacking my way through it. I am trying to make a series of AJAX calls, dependent on success of the prior ones
[10:18:12] <thoraxe> and it's getting ugly real fast
[10:18:21] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe look at deferred objects/promises.
[10:18:24] <thoraxe> i think i am supposed to use callbacks or something?
[10:19:19] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe right - you use .done() to make your subsequen call.
[10:19:43] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: correct, stuff inside .done would be where I would do the next call
[10:20:00] <thoraxe> but wrapping a whole .ajax-.done-.fail inside of a .done seems like a rapid way to create something unreadable
[10:20:32] <dp> duch_kazatel: the page I'm trying to work with is 1.7.1 based. the problem exists in 1.7.2 as well
[10:21:03] <thoraxe> it would be nice if I could define a whole ajax call (.ajax, .done, .fail) as a "function", and just call that ajax function as part of someone's .done, if that makes any sense?
[10:21:16] <thoraxe> it would certainly make it more readable
[10:22:39] <thoraxe> is there a way to create a "function" that is just a complete ajax call (.ajax, .done, .error) ?
[10:22:58] <systemfault> thoraxe: Promises are a lot more flexible… it's just that the jquery promise lib sucks hard.
[10:23:22] <thoraxe> systemfault: uh... this is unrelated to promises
[10:23:29] <thoraxe> i want to use a "function" inside the promise.
[10:23:38] <thoraxe> holdon, lemme write up a fiddle/ish
[10:25:38] <thoraxe> http://jsfiddle.net/MrFU5/
[10:25:44] <thoraxe> that's kind of pseudocode for what i want to do
[10:25:55] <thoraxe> otherwise you need to keep wrapping entire promise blocks inside promise blocks
[10:25:57] <thoraxe> and it turns ugly
[10:26:03] <thoraxe> if that's the way you have to do it, so be it
[10:26:12] <thoraxe> but it would seem to be more readable if you used "functions"
[10:26:32] <thoraxe> remember, i'm a total hack when it comes to js
[10:28:24] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe this is what promises do for you...
[10:28:38] <thoraxe> .... i understand what promises do.
[10:28:49] <thoraxe> $.ajax( blahblah ).done()
[10:28:56] <thoraxe> what i am trying to avoid is this
[10:29:19] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:29:20] <thoraxe> $.ajax( blahblah ).done( $.ajax ( foofoo ).done ( $.ajax( barbar ).....
[10:29:54] <duch_kazatel> you have to chain off the object at some point, but you can basically do what you're looking for using deferreds/promises.
[10:30:01] <thoraxe> ....
[10:30:34] <thoraxe> you'll have to show me what you're talking about, because pointing at the docs doesn't get me from the question i asked and my jsfiddle to what you're trying to tell me :(
[10:31:08] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/multiple-simultaneous-ajax-requests-one-callback-jquery/
[10:31:46] <duch_kazatel> dp your bug doesn't reproduce with 1.7.2 - imultaneous-ajax-requests-one-callback-jquery/
[10:31:47] <duch_kazatel> [2014:06:05:10:31:41] * detha (~detha@unaffiliated/detha) has joined
[10:31:55] <duch_kazatel> ffff -> jsfiddle.net/Z7fTJ/1/
[10:32:01] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: i don't see how that helps answer the question
[10:32:36] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel: i'm not making simultaneous requests, and I need a compleete .ajax/.done/.fail for each subsequent request
[10:32:37] <duch_kazatel> you did not read the article.  check out the $.when().then() bit.
[10:32:47] <thoraxe> and, that last link shows exactly what i don't want to do -- continually nest stuff
[10:33:06] <thoraxe> *i don't want to do my requests in parallel*
[10:33:09] <thoraxe> in fact, I cannot.
[10:33:16] <thoraxe> because they are intentionally sequential
[10:33:28] <thoraxe> the first request does something. only if the first request succeeds should I do the second request.
[10:33:51] <thoraxe> each request has to update the UI with its own error message should it fail, or do something unique should it succeed
[10:35:48] <duch_kazatel> then you basically have to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/YtBMu/
[10:36:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to define your functions ahead of time and use callbacks.
[10:36:27] <duch_kazatel> afaik there's really not other way to make them sequential unless you turn async off, but i'd avoid doing that.
[10:36:48] <thoraxe> dude
[10:36:50] <thoraxe> seriously?
[10:37:00] <duch_kazatel> you need sequential ajax requests, right?
[10:37:02] <thoraxe> that's the first fiddle i posted and the first question i asked -- can I define functions for each ajax call
[10:37:17] <thoraxe> your ansewr was "no use all this other stuff" and now you just potsed a fiddle that is basically the first one I posted
[10:37:17] <duch_kazatel> i apparently didn't understand your question.
[10:37:20] <thoraxe> lol
[10:37:22] <thoraxe> sok
[10:37:31] <thoraxe> but that's exactly what i'm trying to do
[10:37:44] <thoraxe> define a bunch of ajax requests as functions and then call them instead of nesting to infinity and beyond
[10:37:50] <DansVC> hi :d
[10:37:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you can do that.
[10:37:53] <thoraxe> cool.
[10:37:56] <thoraxe> duch_kazatel++
[10:38:01] <thoraxe> thanks for hanging in there :)
[10:38:01] <systemfault> I wonder if the jQuery team intend to make their promise implementation suck less.
[10:38:29] <duch_kazatel> thoraxe you didn't have the dollar sign in front of that call in defined_success_function, so i wasn't clear what you were trying to do.
[10:38:51] <thoraxe> gotcha
[10:39:27] <duch_kazatel> systemfault probably.
[10:40:00] <andresdrojas> I need to change the background color of different elements inside a div (I know the id of this div) when I click on them, these elements get added dynamically by the user using the application, and they get assigned andd ID automatically equal to parent_id-1, parent_id-2, etc
[10:40:39] <lexbuck> I'm justing a jquery plugin called Tipr (basic tooltip). Here's the jsfiddle of my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/GyX3j/. When .vote is floated right, it messes with the width of the tooltip. Floating .vote left and it's fine. Any ideas how I can get around this?
[10:43:08] <mobile8> is it possible to check in which element you clicked when using .on('click', function() ?
[10:43:24] <duch_kazatel> mobile8 yes - $(this) inside your handler will be the element
[10:47:59] <andresdrojas> duch_kazatel:this is what I have so far as I only want to apply this function inside this specific parent div: $("parentdiv").on('click',function() if I use $(this) it will select the parent div and not the element inside the parent div
[10:48:07] <andresdrojas> what am I doing wrong?
[10:48:32] <paulvd> andresdrojas: $this.find("element") then ?
[10:48:44] <paulvd> $(this) sorry
[10:49:11] <andresdrojas> paulvd:I'll give it a try
[10:49:40] <mobile8> duch_kazatel: that will just give me the body (i need to know on which element on the body was clicked)
[10:49:55] <frank_o> Anybody know how to prevent these pics from "shooting out of view" once the box is hovered? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/B3dY4/9/embedded/result/
[10:52:03] <andresdrojas> paulvd:by "element" do you mean the specific id or class or the element?
[10:52:59] <paulvd> id or class
[10:53:17] <paulvd> $(this).find('#divname')
[10:54:07] <andresdrojas> paulvd:if I have lets say 3 elements with the same class, how to I specify just the very one I click so I change the properties of just the clicked one not all the elements inside the parent div?
[10:55:16] <bberry> andresdrojas $("#parentdiv").on('click', function(e){ console.log(e.target); });
[10:55:41] <bberry> every event function handler passes an object that contains useful event information
[10:55:56] <thoraxe> dumb firefox/firebug console question -- step into/over/out of -- if I just want to do everything under the highlighted line without diving into it, and pause on the next line, which one do i press?
[10:56:38] <antlong> I'm having trouble with vex, specifically with require.js, has anyone troubleshooted this combo before?
[10:57:25] <paulvd> andresdrojas: a perfect example is here > http://jsfiddle.net/oscarj24/h722g/1/
[10:59:51] <decx> holy repetition batman you put event.target in a new jquery object 10 times
[11:00:58] <bberry> lololol
[11:01:04] <bberry> (get it?)
[11:01:11] <decx> well, 5 times but still
[11:01:12] <BillCriswell> Man, not going mobile first is brutal.
[11:01:25] <andresdrojas> paulvd: thanks, I will check this
[11:03:36] <fvdes> Second try: I must make a request to a server that does not support CORS, so I've added dataType: "jsonp" and the server responds correctly but of course the browser fires an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :" because the response it's clearly a JSON, how can I fix this?
[11:04:34] <duch_kazatel> fvdes does the server support JSONP?>
[11:05:01] <fvdes> I don't think, but the request fires the correct event on the server
[11:05:10] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:05:15] <duch_kazatel> the server needs to support JSONP.
[11:06:07] <fvdes> it generates a json response
[11:06:45] <systemfault> json is not jsonp
[11:06:49] <duch_kazatel> JSONP requires more than just JSON.  the remote server needs to wrap the response witha callback function ref. for you.  without that, JSONP isn't much help.
[11:08:34] <fvdes> well with datatype jsonp I can make the request but i could not get the response, with json I cannot make the request because does not support CORS
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> right.  you are SOL.
[11:09:01] <duch_kazatel> unless you have a server you can proxy through.
[11:09:15] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code?
[11:09:29] <fvdes> nope it's under NDA
[11:09:42] <fvdes> but it's a simple $.ajax
[11:09:47] <fvdes> method get
[11:09:54] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:10:18] <duch_kazatel> you can't share an indicative version of your $.ajax() call?
[11:10:38] <fvdes> i cant share the url
[11:10:50] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle ;)
[11:12:03] <fvdes> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1f071c8757ce035aa374
[11:13:01] <duch_kazatel> which API from blockchain are you using?
[11:13:52] <BillCriswell> http://vimeo.com/61556918#t=4460s
[11:13:53] <fvdes> sending money
[11:13:56] <BillCriswell> I am pretty sure that's god.
[11:14:09] <duch_kazatel> fvdes http://blockchain.info/api - which documentation do i need to look at?
[11:14:14] <fvdes> wallet api
[11:14:23] <fvdes> https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_wallet_api
[11:15:46] <duch_kazatel> it looks like they don't support what you want via frontend javascript.
[11:16:26] <fvdes> But I don't know why I can make a correct request in jsonp but not a correct response
[11:16:36] <duch_kazatel> because they don't support jsonp.
[11:16:49] <friedbyte> is there a way to use jquery to execute a keystroke? Example: onclick execute ctrl++ or ctrl+-
[11:17:26] <fvdes> So they support jsonp in the request but not in the response
[11:17:39] <fvdes> thank you duch_kazatel
[11:17:39] <duch_kazatel> fvdes they dont' support jsonp.
[11:17:48] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you understand what jsonp is.
[11:18:01] <NoiseEee> friedbyte: no, perhaps you should be explicitly calling the event handler that that keystroke would call
[11:18:11] <fvdes> if the don't support jsonp why they server are handling the call correctly?
[11:18:20] <fvdes> with jsonp i can send  money
[11:18:29] <duch_kazatel> fvdes that's not jsonp.
[11:18:43] <duch_kazatel> jsonp is JSON with Padding - they wrap the json in a callback for you to process on your own.
[11:19:05] <duch_kazatel> they're probably recognizing your other request as a simple GET with extra params they're ignoring.
[11:19:12] <fvdes> uhm
[11:19:15] <duch_kazatel> you cannot "sent data" with jsonp
[11:19:19] <duch_kazatel> *send
[11:19:30] <duch_kazatel> JSONP is strictly a technique to retrieve and process data.
[11:19:44] <fvdes> the data is the url in their API
[11:19:55] <fvdes> hmm
[11:19:56] <duch_kazatel> right - that's a GET request.  that is not JSONP
[11:20:22] <fvdes> So there's no way I can get the response in js client side?
[11:20:30] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like they support that, no.
[11:20:34] <fvdes> ok
[11:20:38] <fvdes> thank you so much
[11:30:37] <Chuk_> Is it best practice to use $.serializeArray() to get params for submitting forms with AJAX? If so, is there a best way to massage the data before submitting?
[11:30:47] <Chuk_> ie filtering, validating
[11:31:04] <duch_kazatel> most people validate the inputs before serializing.
[11:31:17] <duch_kazatel> and it depends on your needs and how you need that data.
[11:33:16] <Chuk_> So if I need to reformat a string before submitting it, (from "2014-06-05" to "06/05/2014") how should I add the reformatted value to the serialized array?
[11:33:23] <Chuk_> Thanks for the response, btw
[11:33:45] <duch_kazatel> edit the input data and seralize again instead.
[11:35:21] <Chuk_> Will the user be able to see the format change?
[11:35:52] <duch_kazatel> yes.  if that isn't acceptable, I'd transform that data in the backend, or sync your form with an object elsewhere that has the data formatted the way you need.
[11:36:14] <duch_kazatel> but avoid trying to hand-edit something generated by serializeArray()
[11:40:38] <Chuk_> Gotcha. I'm trying not to make changes to the back end right now. So I think I'll use this approach.
[11:40:52] <axilla> how can I get the height of a div in % if it is being set with auto?
[11:41:03] <axilla> $(element).height() gives me px
[11:41:11] <Chuk_> Thanks so much for your help, duch_kazatel. Sometimes I just can't see the forest for the trees.
[11:42:07] <duch_kazatel> axilla it gets calculated to a specific number.  why do you need the %?
[11:44:09] <Technodrome> Good day
[11:44:18] <Technodrome> Can I serialize from a string of html?
[11:44:21] <axilla> duch_kazatel: because the width of my background-image is larger than the width of my div.. i'm adding a feature to our app where a user can set a custom image for folders.. they can drag and zoom the image to get it just right.  when the image is larger than the div itself the controls get reversed..  up is down and down is up.. so i need to react to that and i want to check if the height of the image is larger than the div when they mov
[11:44:22] <trewd6> how can I select elements with class required in #div1 or #div2
[11:44:24] <Technodrome> rather than using the css selector for it ?
[11:44:53] <axilla> so i can make sure the controls don't reverse
[11:44:59] <axilla> i should say inverse
[11:45:36] <axilla> i can get the width in % by checking the background-size
[11:45:41] <axilla> but i set that as a %width auto
[11:45:45] <axilla> so that won't work for height =/
[11:46:08] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you can seralize from a node, not a string.  $('<form>') <-- kinda like this.
[11:46:22] <Technodrome> so i can’t do it from a block of html?
[11:46:30] <Technodrome> thats in a string
[11:46:39] <Technodrome> i wanted to serialize form something , not on the screen, and i didn’t want to css hide it
[11:46:58] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome huh?
[11:47:08] <duch_kazatel> $('<form>') this creates a node in a fragment for you.
[11:47:19] <Technodrome> ah
[11:47:31] <duch_kazatel> you can treat that like any other node.  if the string you pass the jquery construction starts with a tag (not a tagname), it makes a fragment.
[11:48:47] <Technodrome> i did not know that duch_kazatel
[11:48:52] <trewd6> how can I select elements with class .required in #div1 or #div2
[11:48:56] <Technodrome> i can put a full huge fom inside of that?
[11:49:09] <duch_kazatel> *node, sure.  but i would avoid doing that at all costs.
[11:49:17] <duch_kazatel> because this doesn't change my advice from the other day ;)
[11:59:26] <MikeD_> is .empty() fixed in 1.9?  or should I just use el.children().remove();
[12:00:07] <MikeD_> btw, it makes me laugh every time I imagine that "el" spanish for 'the'
[12:02:35] <trewd6> how can I select elements with class .required in #div1 or #div2
[12:05:36] <BillCriswell> trewd6: $('#div1 .required, #div2 .required')
[12:05:47] <trewd6> BillCriswell: thx
[12:08:00] <thoraxe> why would a jquery/ajax POST that receives a 200 decide it was a failure?
[12:08:45] <BillCriswell> thoraxe: Could maybe be expecting one type of data and getting another. Does it produce an error?
[12:08:55] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: What was wrong with .empty() ?
[12:08:57] <thoraxe> BillCriswell: the error is just "error", it's weird.
[12:09:04] <thoraxe> holdon i'll try to paste some of the code
[12:09:15] <BillCriswell> thoraxe: What type of content is in the document and what headers are being sent?
[12:09:28] <Jattenalle> thoraxe, check the statusText of the ajax object thing
[12:09:43] <MikeD_> BillCriswell: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-empty-does-not-destroy-ui-widgets-whereas-jquery-remove-does-using-ui-1-8-4
[12:09:52] <thoraxe> here's the function http://jsfiddle.net/hLm35/
[12:10:14] <thoraxe> the POST is successful, i'm looking at the server receiving it and it returns a 200
[12:10:26] <thoraxe> it should be returning a bigass json blob
[12:10:47] <MikeD_> perhaps .empty() is not the problem I'm seeing
[12:11:02] <MikeD_> but i don't know how to recreate in a fiddle
[12:11:08] <blindMoe> anyone ever ran into a problem with Select2 using initSelection where it only renders one of the selected values even though the data passed to initSelection has 3 values?
[12:11:14] <blindMoe> I can see that the data being passed is correct
[12:12:15] <BillCriswell> thoraxe: What do the response headers say?
[12:12:19] <thoraxe> i have a breakpoint in console set up inside both the .done and the .fail -- I end up in the .fail and "data" just has "error"
[12:12:29] <thoraxe> BillCriswell: not sure how I would check them
[12:12:43] <BillCriswell> thoraxe: Open the dev tools and look at the "Network" panel.
[12:13:02] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Hmmm... not sure.
[12:13:03] <thoraxe> firebug has no "network" panel?
[12:13:09] <thoraxe> oh just Net ?
[12:13:17] <BillCriswell> That sounds about right then.
[12:13:24] <BillCriswell> I'm only familiar with Chrome's.
[12:14:17] <thoraxe> hmmm
[12:18:49] <BillCriswell> Is it sending as application/json?
[12:18:56] <BillCriswell> I think that's the right content-type.
[12:22:54] <thoraxe> BillCriswell: chrome seems to think the request is "pending"
[12:23:26] <thoraxe> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:3001/sms. -- uhh
[12:23:34] <thoraxe> but according to the app listening at 3001 it loaded just fine?
[12:23:54] <systemfault> thoraxe: Same origin issues?
[12:24:02] <thoraxe> systemfault: origin?
[12:24:07] <systemfault> localhost:3001 is different than localhost:3002
[12:24:20] <thoraxe> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access.
[12:24:45] <systemfault> thoraxe: Add the cors headers
[12:24:59] <thoraxe> systemfault: what does that header even mean? and why would i ever use it?
[12:25:33] <t432> How can you check if a node has any child node? ideally return a int value
[12:25:37] <systemfault> thoraxe: ajax only works to get resources that are on the same domain as the page doing it
[12:25:54] <thoraxe> hmm
[12:25:55] <BillCriswell> t432: You can do like .children().length
[12:26:03] <thoraxe> well by browser needs to make an api call to a different application
[12:26:10] <thoraxe> living somewhere else
[12:26:11] <t432> ah
[12:26:14] <t432> thx
[12:26:16] <systemfault> thoraxe: Then that application needs to support CORS
[12:26:24] <thoraxe> gotta look up how to do cors with rails i guess
[12:26:25] <systemfault> thoraxe: Or it's no go
[12:26:48] <systemfault> thoraxe: And CORS only works with recent browsers.
[12:26:51] <BillCriswell> t432: el.firstChild should true null or an element as well if you just wan to do that.
[12:27:24] <thoraxe> systemfault: this whole application is only going ot work with recent browsers
[12:27:36] <thoraxe> systemfault: define "recent"
[12:27:56] <thoraxe> looks like ie8+
[12:28:00] <systemfault> thoraxe: IE10+
[12:28:20] <systemfault> thoraxe: Basic support is available in ie8 and ie9 via the non-standard XDomainRequest object
[12:29:17] <jenia> hello
[12:29:19] <systemfault> thoraxe: If you only need to GET data, you can use the JSONP hack
[12:29:47] <jenia> i have a div (with a form) that i need to add to my page. I want that div to be a jquery-mobile popup
[12:30:05] <systemfault> thoraxe: Another approach to the problem is to proxy the calls on the webserver       JS -> WebServer -> Application -> WebServer -> JS
[12:30:14] <jenia> btw, I add that div using ajax, at runtime
[12:30:23] <jenia> I tried to add this attribute to the div: data-role="popup"
[12:30:28] <jenia> it didnt do anything
[12:30:41] <jenia> do anyone have any suggestions?]
[12:31:04] <thoraxe> oy this stuff is complicated
[12:31:26] <thoraxe> systemfault: the whole point of making the request to the other application is because i don't want to send the data to the "webserveR" in the first place
[12:31:45] <thoraxe> essentially the user interacts with app running on Server A, but certain requests have to go to Server B because Server A should never see some of that data
[12:31:54] <systemfault> thoraxe: As you can see, the security of the browser doesn't make it easy
[12:32:08] <thoraxe> well i mean, that's ok, just gotta figure out how to do it right
[12:33:20] <thoraxe> http://leopard.in.ua/2012/07/08/using-cors-with-rails/ looks like i may need to do this
[12:33:46] <jenia> got it:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5562461/refresh-a-section-after-adding-html-dynamically-to-jquery-mobile
[12:40:38] <thoraxe> woo looks like that was it (cors)
[12:41:34] <tuskkk___> hello
[12:42:36] <tuskkk___> can someone tell me whats wrong with this piece of code:
[12:42:41] <tuskkk___> $(document).ready(function(){
[12:42:41] <tuskkk___>     $('div').dbclick(function() {
[12:42:41] <tuskkk___>         $(this).fadeOut('fast');
[12:42:41] <tuskkk___>     });
[12:42:41] <tuskkk___> });
[12:43:18] <BillCriswell> tuskkk___: dblclick, not dbclick
[12:43:32] <BillCriswell> Should probablybe using .on('dblclick') as well
[12:43:58] <tuskkk___> oh my god
[12:44:04] <tuskkk___> thanaks BillCriswell
[12:44:19] <tuskkk___> I have been stuck there for like 10 minutes!
[12:46:27] <BillCriswell> tuskkk___: Did an error show up in the console?
[12:46:36] <tuskkk___> yeah
[12:46:53] <tuskkk___> wait will tell you in a second
[12:47:10] <tuskkk___> 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('div').dbclick(function() { })')
[12:47:26] <tuskkk___> but then I had no idea it was dbl clicl
[12:47:48] <BillCriswell> tuskkk___: I haven't seen anyone use dblclick in a while.
[12:48:21] <tuskkk___> oh, these are for codeacedemy problems
[12:48:31] <tuskkk___> new learner here
[12:49:42] <louism2wash> hey guys, if I have two jquery objects that represent the same dom element and I change a data-attribute on one of the objects, how is that change propagated to the other object that references the same dom element?  Is there some internal mechanism that ties those two object's states or is it making a reference back to the dom every time I query a data-attribute?
[12:50:34] <BillCriswell> tuskkk___: Nice.
[12:50:58] <duch_kazatel> louism2wash depends on how you're referencing them, as well as the magic of JavaScript variables.
[12:52:19] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: I am trying to wrap my head around the state of the two jquery objects.  If I change a data-attibute one object and then check the state of that data-attibute on the other object the change will have somehow propagated to the other object
[12:53:21] <duch_kazatel> that's partically because the data is cached elsehwere - when you use .data(), you're actually referencing that cache.
[12:53:45] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: ok, so both objects will reference the same cache?
[12:54:00] <duch_kazatel> yes.  also this: http://jsfiddle.net/WkV37/
[12:56:35] <duch_lunch> brb
[12:59:51] <louism2wash> duch_lunch: I appreciate the help
[13:04:47] <cam_y> on resizing a window, I have a height adjuster called.. it works well in FF and chrome however in IE i see small blank space at bottom
[13:04:50] <cam_y> not sure what it is
[13:04:57] <cam_y> any clue ?
[13:05:19] <shiftins> cam_y: display block vs. inline?
[13:06:09] <trewd6> How can I select all nested children elements with class .class1 from the following: $(this).parent().parent().parent().nextAll(".comm")
[13:06:10] <NoiseEee> are you using some sort of css reset that minimizes silly CSS rendering differences between browsers, cam_y?
[13:06:44] <BillCriswell> If there's an image in there it's probably because it's display inline.
[13:07:00] <BillCriswell> I wonder why images are display inline by default. Rarely see them inline.
[13:07:05] <louism2wash> duch_lunch: so how should I be thinking about situations where I am altering the dom from two different jquery objects?  In that case the changes to the dom are not synced between objects.  http://jsfiddle.net/WkV37/1/
[13:07:06] <cam_y> shiftins.. yeah can be. I have <container> that contains inlined-blocks
[13:07:13] <cam_y> does it affect ?
[13:07:25] <cam_y> NoiseEee yeah I think we have reset css
[13:07:43] <cam_y> NoiseEee: but I thought that helps, no ?
[13:08:14] <NoiseEee> it should cam_y, im saying maybe you don't. otherwise use an inspector and see whats up in IE
[13:08:44] <cam_y> NoiseEee: by inspector you meant F12 dev tools ?
[13:08:45] <cam_y> they suck
[13:08:48] <tripflex> hey guys, i have an open source module that i attempting to load div data from another page but for some reason if the page that is running the jquery is using https jquery still uses http
[13:08:49] <tripflex> https://github.com/tripflex/whmcs-affcoupons/blob/master/modules/addons/affcoupons/inc/js/affiliates.js
[13:08:49] <cam_y> is there anything else
[13:09:02] <NoiseEee> cam_y: thats what i mean, yeah
[13:09:03] <duch_lunch> cam_y IE11's dev tools are much better
[13:09:14] <tripflex> so for instance $('.something').load('index.php?m=page');
[13:09:26] <cam_y> NoiseEee: i'm on IE9 :)
[13:09:37] <tripflex> if the page is https, it still attempts to load using http, which obvisouly throws a CORS error
[13:09:56] <tripflex> i guess my real question is how does jquery determine the relative URL to use if it's not specified
[13:10:17] <tripflex> i noticed in Google Analytics they actually check with javascript to determine http or https
[13:10:46] <tripflex> i was thinking about using '//domain.com/file.js' but wanted to ask here first before doing that or using the same method as google analytics to determine http or https
[13:10:56] <duch_lunch> tripflex that method works fine.
[13:11:00] <tripflex> i guess my assumption was that jquery would use the same url as the page (and protocol)
[13:11:07] <tripflex> what does?
[13:11:14] <duch_lunch> '//domain.com/file.js'
[13:11:22] <duch_lunch> though jquery should automatically use the same URL.
[13:11:30] <tripflex> yeah that's what i thought
[13:11:33] <tripflex> but can't figure out why it's not
[13:11:39] <duch_lunch> can you show your code?
[13:11:46] <tripflex> https://github.com/tripflex/whmcs-affcoupons/blob/master/modules/addons/affcoupons/inc/js/affiliates.js
[13:12:11] <tripflex> index page is pulled by getting the value of a hidden input on the page
[13:12:23] <tripflex> to support index.php or my-custom-index.php
[13:12:38] <duch_lunch> what values can that have?
[13:13:00] <tripflex> it's always going to be index.php unless the person changes the configure
[13:13:02] <tripflex> config
[13:13:05] <tripflex> it will always be something.php
[13:13:25] <duch_lunch> and what URL is the request being made to?
[13:13:33] <tripflex> could not having '/' prepended be an issue?
[13:13:41] <tripflex> it's not specified
[13:13:44] <tripflex> it's just calling
[13:13:52] <tripflex> .load('index.php?m=affcoupons');
[13:14:00] <duch_lunch> slap a / in front of that.
[13:14:09] <duch_lunch> otherwise, check your net panel to see where requests are being made from.
[13:14:17] <tripflex> durr
[13:14:19] <tripflex> net panel?
[13:14:30] <duch_lunch> what browser are you in?
[13:15:07] <tripflex> chrome or firefox
[13:15:13] <trewd6> BillCriswell: can you help?
[13:15:40] <duch_lunch> okay - chrome's developer tools has a "network" tab.  firebug has a "net" tab.
[13:16:16] <BillCriswell> trewd6: Hard time following what you asked.
[13:16:41] <trewd6> How can I select all nested children elements with class .class1 from the following: $(this).parent().parent().parent().nextAll(".comm")
[13:17:04] <BillCriswell> trewd6: So from .comm ?
[13:17:08] <trewd6> yep
[13:17:31] <tripflex> yeah but i mean that's how its pulling the actual URL to use
[13:17:33] <BillCriswell> I guess you could do .find('*')... that smells though.
[13:17:40] <hackal> Hello is there some jquery function which detects when you type something in <input> I need it for dynamic validation.
[13:17:46] <tripflex> i guess i was just trying to figure out why it was using http instead of https which is what the page was loaded using
[13:17:52] <duch_lunch> hackal .on('change', or .on('keydown
[13:17:59] <BillCriswell> trewd6: Should look into .closest() instead of .parent().parent().parent()
[13:19:27] <tripflex> welp, tried it on a site that was having problem and preface with / didnt help
[13:19:45] <duch_lunch> tripflex what does the network panel say?
[13:20:01] <BillCriswell> Where did "welp" originate from?
[13:20:11] <BillCriswell> See it often, no idea where it came from.
[13:20:14] <BillCriswell> Should research.
[13:20:36] <duch_lunch> apparently jim carrey in dumb and dumber
[13:20:59] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[13:21:21] <BillCriswell> Haven't seen that in a while.
[13:21:23] <trewd6> BillCriswell: wouldn't closest() get me the first parent up
[13:21:38] <BillCriswell> trewd6: You'd give it a selector and it would return that.
[13:21:56] <BillCriswell> trewd6: so like $('.foo').closest('.container') would go up till it reaches .container.
[13:22:27] <tripflex> AH HA!
[13:22:30] <tripflex> oh man
[13:22:34] <tripflex> it looks like it's due to cloudflare
[13:22:46] <duch_lunch> ?
[13:22:56] <jessica573> so
[13:22:56] <tripflex> shows a 302 and redirects to http
[13:22:58] <tripflex> ugh
[13:23:23] <jessica573> i want to chain together classes using .close(.column .list .xcyz) is that the right syntax?
[13:23:32] <tripflex> i had like 5 people email about this problem, only thing i can assume is they all are using cloudflare
[13:23:35] <BillCriswell> jessica573: no space.
[13:23:35] <duch_lunch> jessica573 "chain"?
[13:23:35] <tripflex> time to do some research
[13:23:48] <jessica573> BillCriswell: thanks
[13:23:49] <BillCriswell> Assuming you want class="column list xcyz"
[13:23:59] <jessica573> BillCriswell: yes
[13:24:06] <BillCriswell> .column.list.xcyz
[13:24:13] <jessica573> thanks BillCriswell
[13:24:17] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:24:31] <duch_lunch> tripflex are you in control of that server?
[13:24:48] <BillCriswell> What did you have for lunch duch_lunch?
[13:24:53] <tripflex> not that one
[13:24:59] <tripflex> works fine on my server
[13:25:01] <duch_lunch> ah. okay.
[13:25:02] <tripflex> but i also dont use http anywhere
[13:25:03] <tripflex> :P
[13:25:08] <tripflex> just trying to help out others
[13:26:01] <jessica573> BillCriswell: can something like $('#identifier').closest('.xyz').closest('.abc').closest('.bbb').find('.eee').text() be done?
[13:27:38] <BillCriswell> jessica573: Yes... though $('#id').closest('.bbb').find('.eee'); would be a lot shorter.
[13:28:48] <hackal> Hello I am trying to do "live" validation where: If there is nothing inside <input>, <p> tag will disappear and vice versa. http://jsfiddle.net/hnWgL/3/ here is my try but it is not working at all. Could you please help me?
[13:28:52] <BillCriswell> If you're looking for an .xyz.abc.bbb you'd do .closest('.xyz.abc.bbb') though. Not sure what you're going for exactly.
[13:28:58] <jessica573> BillCriswell: what if #id is not a child element of .bbb
[13:29:05] <jessica573> but they share the same parent
[13:29:27] <jessica573> or...have a common ancestor.
[13:29:47] <duch_lunch> hackal check the length of val
[13:29:59] <BillCriswell> .closest() goes up the DOM.
[13:30:14] <duch_lunch> what's the different between .closest() and .parents()?
[13:30:20] <duch_lunch> *difference
[13:30:23] <jessica573> BillCriswell: ok.
[13:30:28] <duch_lunch> oh i see it nvm.
[13:30:29] <BillCriswell> duch_lunch: I think .parents() will return more than one.
[13:30:47] <BillCriswell> jessica573: If you have some example HTML this could be a lot clearer.
[13:31:52] <hackal> duch_lunch: thanks, http://jsfiddle.net/hnWgL/4/ now it works but when I delete text it wont hide now. Looks like else part is not executing.
[13:32:06] <jessica573> BillCriswell: already got it to work though :)
[13:32:11] <jessica573> thanks!
[13:32:13] <BillCriswell> jessica573: Ok cool.
[13:32:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:32:44] <duch_kazatel> hackeron that's not what i suggested.
[13:32:54] <duch_kazatel> $('#inputLarge').val().length
[13:33:38] <opie-wrk> ohh, $("#mydiv").is(":data('ui-slider')")    this is so hot
[13:33:55] <duch_kazatel> opie-wrk that selector doesn't make sense.
[13:34:08] <opie-wrk> duch_kazatel: sure it does, it checks if my div is a jquery ui slider
[13:34:10] <duch_kazatel> #mydiv will be unique anyway, so why would would add that attribute check?
[13:34:15] <duch_kazatel> aaaah that's what you're doing.
[13:34:45] <hackal> duch_kazatel: val().length will will work with at least 2 characters.
[13:34:56] <opie-wrk> yeah, right it's a bad selector i agreee, sorry. just love that you can use 'is' on the custom widget selectors that get created by widget bridge
[13:35:08] <duch_kazatel> hackal console.log() that value before your logic and see what's going on.
[13:35:13] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: hey earlier, so putting a block of html in the $(“<form>”)   is ok right?
[13:35:32] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome huh?
[13:35:37] <Technodrome> sorry, yeah
[13:35:42] <Technodrome> just got back , it was a while ago
[13:36:03] <Technodrome> i want my form to serliaize remember, but i dont want it in the DOM and displayed, and i dont want to do a display none either hehe
[13:36:14] <duch_kazatel> then don't use a form.
[13:36:15] <duch_kazatel> use data.
[13:36:30] <duch_kazatel> you're munging things together and setting yourself up for headaches
[13:40:05] <Voyage>  if i use websockets and force my users to install latest firefox / chrom / safari / opera , I am good to go without socket.io?  because if I use socket.io , I would have to use node.js, and then configure the way for node.js to communicate with my php/java webserver for authentication etc. am I thinking correct?
[13:50:00] <antlong> i need some help debugging vex, is anyone familiar with it? (vex.js)
[13:50:28] <hackal> Is there a way to change animation direction in .hide()?
[13:53:05] <__joshua___> in jquery ui, at least
[13:53:05] <__joshua___> http://api.jqueryui.com/slide-effect/
[13:53:22] <__joshua___> example:  $(this).hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 300);
[13:58:57] <hackal> __joshua___: I am getting error in console with this. Default animation is reducing width and height at the same time. I just need to reduce height. something like this http://api.jqueryui.com/blind-effect/ but this is not working with .hide()
[13:59:09] <hyppias> want to read a file and write into another existing file: http://pastebin.com/xdK3bXZg is this the way to go?
[13:59:35] <__joshua___> hackal: are you using jquery ui?
[14:00:03] <tandroid> what would the underscore in _.debounce() be for?
[14:00:22] <hackal> __joshua___: oh no
[14:00:39] <duch_kazatel> tandroid that's a library.
[14:00:41] <duch_kazatel> underscore.js
[14:01:14] <tandroid> Ah
[14:01:49] <__joshua___> hyppias: you want to ajax request some xml and put it in page?  nearly there.  maybe $("span.datum").html($(opf).find("meta[property='dcterms:modified']).text());
[14:03:14] <__joshua___> _.debounce is very handy.  Typically you use it for things like reading input from user.  say you have a 100ms debounce on keyup on a search field... the function will only fire AFTER 100ms of not pressing a key (it resets the timer with every invocation)
[14:04:32] <tandroid> Oh okay, it makes sense. So it's basically a delay?
[14:05:41] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: i have to do it this way
[14:05:50] <Technodrome> unless i want to recrate the form
[14:05:58] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome right - you made that excuse the other day.
[14:06:22] <Technodrome> whats wrong with me doing a serialize on a form , then doing an ajax post?
[14:06:24] <Technodrome> whats wrong with that?
[14:06:34] <duch_kazatel> nothing - you're trying to store state is a really bizarre way.
[14:06:55] <Technodrome> i just want a hidden form to execute when they click a button
[14:06:57] <Technodrome> that’s it
[14:07:01] <__joshua___> the serializing is of a form is normal.  but yeah, whats with your persistence?
[14:07:05] <duch_kazatel> why do you need a form to do that?
[14:07:08] <duch_kazatel> why can't you just store data?
[14:07:14] <Technodrome> what do you mean?
[14:07:33] <duch_kazatel> literally what i'm asking - why do you need a form to transmit data?
[14:07:52] <duch_kazatel> why not ajax over the data alone, instead of needing some kind of "hidden form" storage mechanism.
[14:07:58] <__joshua___> school maybe?
[14:08:26] <__joshua___> if so, its probably because they wrote the course 10 years ago?
[14:08:45] <Technodrome> the form is going to be transmitted to a drupal webform duch_kazatel
[14:08:48] <duch_kazatel> he kept saying he doesn't want to "recreate the firm"
[14:08:50] <duch_kazatel> whatever that means.
[14:09:14] <Technodrome> i can’t touch any code on that server, only html / js , compiled java app
[14:09:18] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you are serialising data and ajaxing that data to a server, right?
[14:09:20] <Technodrome> orders are not going through correctly
[14:09:26] <Technodrome> yes duch_kazatel
[14:09:29] <Technodrome> a *remote* server
[14:09:46] <duch_kazatel> then the data only needs to be formatted a certain way.
[14:09:53] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with a form.
[14:09:56] <Technodrome> but to post to drupal webform qrequires a pretty big form, 15 plus hidden elements that will never change
[14:10:09] <duch_kazatel> that does not change my advice.
[14:10:14] <Technodrome> so i didn’t want to sit here and add all of those manually to $.post or whatever
[14:10:32] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to. you need to create an object and store data in that instead.
[14:10:34] <Technodrome> so i was going to populate the form, serialize it, take that data and post it over to the remote server (drupal webform)
[14:10:35] <__joshua___> ok that makes sense.  just serialize the form and post it
[14:11:12] <Technodrome> basically this is just debug, so they can compare orders in their system, vs orders being posted over via js
[14:11:12] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you're posting over $.ajax(), right?
[14:11:17] <Technodrome> yes
[14:11:40] <__joshua___> literally $.post($(form).target, $(form).serialize()) ?
[14:11:47] <Technodrome> the whole issue is , drupal webform requires a pretty large domian specific structure to their form
[14:11:49] <duch_kazatel> he doesn't want it in the DOM.
[14:11:56] <duch_kazatel> his requirements are impoissible.
[14:12:21] <__joshua___> oh right.  not impossible.  painful though.  wait, i have a snippet for this i think
[14:12:21] <Technodrome> yes, this form would be secret
[14:12:21] <Technodrome> we dont want the user to see 2 order froms
[14:12:33] <duch_kazatel> and you don't want to hide it wish CSS, right?
[14:12:41] <duch_kazatel> because i don't think a fragment will properly work for this.
[14:12:43] <__joshua___> (tech, you don't have to attach it to the document)
[14:12:50] <Technodrome> yes i dont want to hide it with CSS
[14:13:05] <__joshua___> var secret_from = $(form).clone();
[14:13:08] <Technodrome> the fact i want this hidden form not in the document, makes peopel go crazy on me
[14:13:09] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ but will that fragment have security problems?
[14:13:18] <__joshua___> such as?
[14:13:39] <duch_kazatel> if he's sending stuff via ajax?  is it the same domain/etc?
[14:13:41] <duch_kazatel> i guess it is.,
[14:13:53] <duch_kazatel> i just feel like this whole setup is far more complicated than it needs to be.
[14:13:57] <Technodrome> but if i want to post this to a drupal webform, there is alot of form structure and if one thing is off, it won’t work
[14:14:25] <Technodrome> and creating it all manually with $.post just seemed like something i didn’t want to do
[14:14:28] <duch_kazatel> right, which is why you construct your data to the same format.  you're just shipping over data in a predetermined format.  i don't understand why the form is mission critical, but OK.
[14:14:39] <__joshua___> clone serialize post. done, right?
[14:14:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm just trying to reduce your headaches down the road, that's all.
[14:14:58] <Technodrome> __joshua___: the order form and the webform are different structure, although they contain the same data
[14:15:04] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: this is just testing
[14:15:06] <Technodrome> nothing more
[14:15:13] <Technodrome> they’re re doing their whole system
[14:15:35] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to change my opinions, but ok.
[14:16:31] <Technodrome> 2 days of use
[14:16:39] <Technodrome> let me show you the form
[14:16:58] <duch_kazatel> i don't really care about the form tbh.
[14:17:00] <duch_kazatel> do what you want.
[14:17:19] <naeluh_thurs> yo
[14:17:25] <duch_kazatel> whuddup naeluh_thurs
[14:17:38] <naeluh_thurs> just stuck on some canvas as usual
[14:18:05] <naeluh_thurs> how you doing ?
[14:18:17] <Technodrome> http://pastebin.com/7jyw0UvD
[14:18:22] <Technodrome> its kinda  a big form
[14:18:22] <duch_kazatel> a little tired.  but fine otherwise.
[14:18:34] <duch_kazatel> congrats.
[14:18:36] <Technodrome> so i was just going to set the values of the form , serialize it, and ajax post it
[14:18:36] <naeluh_thurs> steady on the grind
[14:19:16] <Technodrome> and i could just recreate it and send over everything via the ajax post manually , and test till it’s right, but now i’m more curious from a proof of concept perspective how this would be done
[14:20:25] <Technodrome> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15173965/serializing-and-submitting-a-form-with-jquery-post-and-php
[14:20:37] <Technodrome> *exactly* like this, but instead my form isn’t in the DOM
[14:20:48] <duch_kazatel> it has to be in the DOM somewhere btw.
[14:21:05] <Technodrome> why? can’t it just be saved purely in js / jquery , then serialized?
[14:21:06] <duch_kazatel> it can be in a fragment, but you can't not have it in the DOM
[14:21:12] <duch_kazatel> that creates a fragment.
[14:21:26] <Technodrome> but its not added to the screen is what i mean?
[14:21:35] <Technodrome> in this case, he has it in the DOM / html or what not
[14:21:49] <duch_kazatel> sure - a fragment is still "in the DOM"
[14:21:50] <Technodrome> i just want it not displayed to the viewer
[14:21:53] <Technodrome> ok
[14:21:56] <Technodrome> i was unaware of this
[14:21:59] <Technodrome> what is a fragment?
[14:22:21] <duch_kazatel> !g documentfragments resig
[14:22:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: John Resig - DOM DocumentFragments → http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
[14:22:46] <duch_kazatel> basically, a separate container that is not apart of the current window, so it's not rendered.
[14:22:55] <duch_kazatel> you can interact with it almost exactly like any other element.
[14:23:04] <Technodrome> ok, exactly what i need
[14:23:16] <Technodrome> i need a form fragment, then i can serialize, then post via ajax with those values
[14:23:26] <duch_kazatel> *document fragment
[14:23:43] <Technodrome> i was unaware of fragments
[14:23:49] <duch_kazatel> lots of people are.
[14:25:33] <duch_kazatel> i'm wondering if anybody has any good data about acceptable js error rates for medium/high traffic sites.
[14:27:15] <__joshua___> js error?
[14:27:33] <duch_kazatel> javascript errors.  exceptions.  etc.
[14:27:53] <__joshua___> uncaught exceptions?  0 sounds like a good number
[14:28:02] <duch_kazatel> sure, when you host all of the js yourself.
[14:28:16] <duch_kazatel> we can't account for 3rd parties, people on absurdly slow connections, etc.
[14:28:45] <duch_kazatel> 0 is what you want, but not reasonable when 3rd party libraries are part of the problem.
[14:29:22] <duch_kazatel> and while we build the case that we need to not support those libraries, I wonder if there's some sort of threshold that most people shoot for/is "normal"
[14:29:44] <__joshua___> well I do notice errors all the time on lots of major sites, but its usually caused by adblock i think, as expected dom elements don't exist
[14:30:19] <duch_kazatel> that can be part of the problem, yeah.  there are also cases where a 3rd party is expecting another script to be done and a race condition has popped/etc.
[14:37:49] <hyppias> is there a way to step through a script that is in an HTML page?
[14:43:20] <degva> Hello everyone, I have this line of code: $.getJSON('json/test.json', function(data) { ... } which only prints a message in the console and assigns the data inside the json to a variable
[14:43:31] <degva> the problem is that the function is not beign executed
[14:43:56] <degva> neither the console.log and the test_json = data are beign executed
[14:44:29] <degva> any ideas? I cannot solve that problem since a couple hours now :/
[14:45:01] <duch_kazatel> degva are you getting any console errors?
[14:47:14] <degva> not exactly
[14:47:27] <degva> just a message saying that I just get the file
[14:48:01] <duch_kazatel> can you fiddle your code then?
[14:48:24] <gandalfx> where can I reliably submit a feature request for jQuery core?
[14:48:44] <duch_kazatel> gandalfx might want to ask in #jquery-dev.
[14:48:50] <duch_kazatel> what are you looking for?
[14:48:58] <gandalfx> I did, I got no answer
[14:49:11] <duch_kazatel> what are you looking for?
[14:49:23] <gandalfx> I'd like to suggest an integer argument for .parent(n) that allows you to go up n levels
[14:50:07] <duch_kazatel> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[14:50:12] <duch_kazatel> that's where you want to go
[14:52:04] <duch_kazatel> though that'll probably get turned down.
[14:52:13] <gandalfx> why?
[14:52:15] <duch_kazatel> but they might fulfill it.
[14:52:26] <shoky> .parents().eq(n)
[14:52:28] <duch_kazatel> because you can chain eq() on it to problem
[14:53:18] <duch_kazatel> *on to it no problem.
[14:53:41] <gandalfx> that's not what I meant
[14:53:51] <gandalfx> eq selects the n-th item afaik
[14:54:04] <duch_kazatel> what do you expect .parent(2) to return?
[14:54:05] <gandalfx> I mean a count for chained .parent().parent().parent()...
[14:54:15] <shoky> .parents().eq(2)
[14:54:18] <shoky> would get you that
[14:54:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah - .parents().eq(2)
[14:54:29] <gandalfx> okay then I'm just too dumb to see it
[14:54:35] <shoky> parent/parents
[14:54:43] <gandalfx> I'll read up on it. thanks for your time x)
[14:56:02] <pixelBash> http://jsfiddle.net/HR9p9/
[14:56:31] <shoky> parents
[14:56:31] <shoky> not parent
[14:56:31] <duch_kazatel> console.log that instead :(
[14:56:42] <pixelBash> neat trick
[14:56:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/HR9p9/1/
[14:57:23] <gandalfx> yeah I got it now xD
[14:57:35] <pixelBash> usually use closest
[14:58:11] <gandalfx> sure. I actually only have a few cases where I want to go up two levels and I got bored of writing .parent().parent()
[14:58:28] <gandalfx> and I thought something like that might have other usecases
[14:58:35] <akim> gandalfx, i would use a for-loop
[14:58:41] <__joshua___> parents('selector')
[14:58:57] <__joshua___> or closest, like pixelBash says
[14:59:03] <jenia> hello.
[14:59:45] <jenia> i need to create a jquery-mobile popup dyanmically.
[14:59:46] <jenia> after an ajax call.
[14:59:46] <jenia> I can get it to work.
[14:59:48] <__joshua___> $.ajax(url).done(function(){ $(someel).dialog(); });
[15:02:27] <jenia> thanks __joshua___
[15:02:36] <jenia> I have one clarification to ask for:
[15:02:43] <jenia> my html tree goes like this:
[15:03:01] <chovy> is there anyway to get $.ajax().settings.dataType or something? I want to know in the repsonse what the dataType was on the request.
[15:03:29] <jenia> <page>    <content><close-content>      <popup><close-popup>     <close-page>
[15:03:39] <jenia> is that the correct way?
[15:05:08] <jenia> cool: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6101370/creating-a-dialog-jquery-mobile
[15:11:49] <__joshua___> jqXHR.done(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {});, jqXHR probably has dataTupe
[15:15:33] <jenia> can someone please tell me:
[15:15:56] <jenia> when i;m creating a popup, i need to do leave this line under page-content
[15:16:06] <jenia> p><a href="dialog.html" data-rel="dialog" data-role="button">Is this a question?</a></p>
[15:16:35] <jenia> and then I need to leave this line: <div data-role="page" data-url="dialog.html">Everything here is a popup</div>
[15:18:06] <jenia> but if I dont have the first <a href="dialog.html"></a> because the dialog creation is done by js, then how do I actually create the dialog?
[15:18:25] <duch_kazatel> jenia can you create a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[15:18:59] <jenia> sure
[15:19:04] <jenia> one minute please
[15:19:09] <hyppias> how to get more detail inan $.ajax call:  http://pastebin.com/zYA3p9j1  ??
[15:20:01] <duch_kazatel> hyppias don't use an alert.
[15:20:03] <jenia> I cant find jquery mobile
[15:20:34] <duch_kazatel> jenia http://jsfiddle.net/RCqG6/
[15:20:38] <hyppias> dutch_kazatel: what then ?
[15:20:45] <duch_kazatel> hyppias console.log.
[15:21:01] <jenia> thanks
[15:21:25] <duch_kazatel> hyppias you have to pass the objects through: ( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown ) are what's availablke.
[15:22:24] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/RCqG6/1/
[15:22:38] <hyppias> can you point me to an example?
[15:22:39] <jenia> it doesnt run correctly there. but normally, on my machine, a dialog popups up
[15:22:49] <jenia> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6101370/creating-a-dialog-jquery-mobile
[15:22:53] <duch_kazatel> hyppias http://pastebin.com/aUrkU70x
[15:23:23] <jenia> the answer that got 13 ups. what i want to do is the same thing, but without the href; instead i want to open the dialog programmatically with js
[15:24:20] <duch_kazatel> jenia it's because the data-url value is bad.  but to launch a dialog, check out using .on() to bind an event handler.
[15:25:04] <jenia> okay thanks. let me check it out
[15:26:51] <jenia> duch_kazatel, I'm confused. I want to run something like $("#dialog").create when my ajax call returns.
[15:27:14] <jenia> I'm not waiting for anything. The point when I want to create the dialog, I've finishe waiting.
[15:27:34] <duch_kazatel> then run the create in the done callback of the ajax call.
[15:28:15] <jenia> what's the function?
[15:28:32] <duch_kazatel> which one?
[15:28:38] <jenia> to create the dialog
[15:28:49] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery ui api dialog
[15:28:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: No matches.
[15:28:52] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[15:28:54] <duch_kazatel> there.
[15:29:25] <jenia> okay thanks a lot
[15:29:31] <antlong> anyone use tooltipster?
[15:32:50] <duch_kazatel> antlong just ask your question.
[15:33:18] <antlong> there doesn't seem to be a config for hide delay, and i need to speed it up, it takes too long to hide itself when you change focus
[15:35:03] <jenia> duch_kazatel, I just dont get it!! lol
[15:36:27] <jenia> i can't do it
[15:37:04] <duch_kazatel> jenia what don't you get?
[15:37:19] <jenia> i can;t do it
[15:37:26] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.
[15:37:27] <jenia> i can;t open the dialog programmatically
[15:37:34] <duch_kazatel> you definitely can.
[15:37:41] <jenia> please can you give me an example of how to use jquery-mobikle
[15:37:45] <jenia> i mean
[15:37:52] <jenia> this specific problem
[15:38:12] <jenia> I added an id to that dialog id="jenia"
[15:38:23] <duch_kazatel> and you want to launch that one?
[15:38:31] <jenia> then i do $("#jenia").dialog("open")
[15:38:32] <jenia> yes
[15:38:44] <duch_kazatel> $( ".selector" ).dialog( "open" );
[15:38:45] <jenia> it told me:"cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'create'"
[15:38:55] <duch_kazatel> then you need to create it first.
[15:39:02] <duch_kazatel> it's a 2 step process.
[15:39:05] <jenia> then i do $("#jenia").dialog()
[15:39:07] <duch_kazatel> initialize the modal, then launch it.
[15:39:15] <jenia> how to initialize it?
[15:39:37] <jenia> im new to this. i just need one working example to beat the initia
[15:39:38] <duch_kazatel> by calling .dialog() on the modal.
[15:39:41] <jenia> okay
[15:39:44] <jenia> i did that
[15:39:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default
[15:40:00] <ezioa> how can i submit a file without the form redirecting?
[15:40:03] <jenia> "no such method 'open' for dialog widget instance"
[15:40:18] <duch_kazatel> jenia slooowwww doooowwwwnnn
[15:40:28] <duch_kazatel> read what i just sent you - it has code examples on it.,
[15:42:26] <jenia> duch_kazatel, I did that ("#jenia").dialog()
[15:42:38] <jenia> and nothing happens. the html tree changes, but nothing appears on the screen
[15:42:53] <duch_kazatel> jenia right.
[15:42:56] <duch_kazatel> and then you call open()
[15:43:43] <jenia> $("#dialog-jenia").open()
[15:43:43] <jenia> TypeError: undefined is not a function
[15:43:43] <jenia> $("#dialog-jenia").dialog("open")
[15:43:43] <jenia> "no such method 'open' for dialog widget instance"
[15:44:07] <jenia> what am i missing?
[15:45:09] <duch_kazatel> paste it in a fiddle.
[15:45:11] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have.
[15:45:46] <jenia> okay one second
[15:45:54] <duch_kazatel> do you have jquery ui even loaded on the page?
[15:47:14] <jenia> http://pastebin.com/FJczX0Ca'
[15:47:21] <jenia> http://pastebin.com/FJczX0Ca **no '
[15:47:44] <jenia> i pasted it there cause jsfiddle doesnt allow to paste the html tags and so on
[15:48:02] <duch_kazatel> jenia because it should be as simple as calling .dialog({}) with whatever options on the thing you want to be a modal, and then .dialog( "open" ) to open it.
[15:48:18] <jenia> doesnt work for me
[15:48:33] <jenia> it must always be me lol
[15:48:49] <duch_kazatel> holy shit 1.5.2...
[15:49:04] <jenia> ups
[15:49:11] <duch_kazatel> jquery mobile 1.0a4.1...
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> update your copies of stuff.
[15:50:56] <duch_kazatel> and my bad, you want this page: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0-beta.1/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[15:51:01] <duch_kazatel> not jquery ui
[15:53:31] <il> hi all
[16:10:58] <mdev> does 2.x increase performance beyond just having a smaller size?
[16:12:16] <tw2113> i think the api is supposed to be the same, just no IE8 and down support
[16:13:00] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:13:14] <duch_kazatel> 2.x is inline with 1.x as far as features, but drops old browser support.
[16:14:16] <mdev> so no speed up then?
[16:14:20] <mdev> short of smaller file size?
[16:15:03] <duch_kazatel> dunno why there would be.
[16:15:10] <mdev> just wondering, thanks
[16:29:57] <Jadenn> hello. i'm trying to prevent a dynamically created form from submitting, however $('.roomInput').on('submit', 'input[type="submit"]', function(event) {} doesn't seem to let me prevent it
[16:30:15] <Jadenn> where .roomInput is the form and input[type=""] is the submit button
[16:32:18] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn you want to prevent submit on the form, not the button.
[16:32:31] <Jadenn> ah, ty
[16:38:01] <mobile8> using the <main> tag, is it recommended?
[16:38:20] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[16:38:33] <duch_kazatel> are you using it correctly?
[16:41:50] <jaspertheghost_> hello question http://jsfiddle.net/5LjSt/  what am i doing wrong here?
[16:42:00] <jaspertheghost_> trying to get this form to validate onclick
[16:42:28] <duch_kazatel> jquery 1.5
[16:42:31] <duch_kazatel> using inline event handlers.
[16:42:47] <jaspertheghost_> i dont follow?
[16:42:57] <duch_kazatel> <input type="button" onClick="validatef(); value="try">
[16:43:10] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid HTML, and using onClick= in html is a bad idea
[16:43:20] <duch_kazatel> you're also using an ancient version of jquery
[16:43:35] <jaspertheghost_> on my person computer where im testing my real webapp im using 1.9
[16:43:39] <jaspertheghost_> still isnt working
[16:43:52] <mobile8> duch_kazatel: so I can now have <header> <main> and <footer> right ?
[16:43:54] <duch_kazatel> right, because the line I shared isn't valid.
[16:44:01] <mobile8> thats where i want t o use it for
[16:44:12] <duch_kazatel> but don't put your handlers inline, jaspertheghost_
[16:44:31] <duch_kazatel> mobile8 you can use those yeah.  but read up on what <header> and <footer> are actually for.
[16:45:38] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost_ http://jsfiddle.net/5LjSt/4/ do something like this instea.d
[16:46:50] <jaspertheghost_> i tried that too
[16:46:59] <jaspertheghost_> and put it in <head> and tried onload
[16:47:06] <jaspertheghost_> when i do that
[16:47:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5LjSt/8/
[16:47:14] <jaspertheghost_> i get nothing like literally no console msg or anything
[16:47:15] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[16:47:20] <duch_kazatel> you need just $("#registerForm").validate();
[16:47:33] <duch_kazatel> it takes care of the rest.
[16:48:08] <jaspertheghost_> yea i know i could do that
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> that's how that's supposed to be used.
[16:48:25] <jaspertheghost_> but in my code the form doesnt submit … it will call a JS function which uses a sjsinterface for android
[16:48:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:49:18] <jaspertheghost_> var ret = window.jsinterface.MYANDROIDFUNCTION_tosubmit(data)   where data is document.getlementby id stuff ...
[16:49:33] <jaspertheghost_> but i want to validate the data first and i’d rather not right my own code to do that
[16:49:35] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're talking about now...
[16:49:56] <jaspertheghost_> i just need to be able to validate on a regular button click
[16:50:03] <duch_kazatel> link to documentation?
[16:50:52] <jaspertheghost_> to jqeury validate or the other stuff i was talking about… the other stuff i already have done
[16:51:05] <duch_kazatel> the specific validation plugin you are using.
[16:51:30] <jaspertheghost_> http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[16:51:30] <duch_kazatel> what you need to do is read it to see if it has a section for manually triggering it.
[16:51:34] <jaspertheghost_> thank you for your help with this
[16:51:44] <jaspertheghost_> im still learning the ropes with JS
[16:52:04] <duch_kazatel> what you're doing right now is calling the init function
[16:53:12] <jaspertheghost_> oh .. so it attaches onload then …
[16:53:17] <duch_kazatel> document ready.
[16:53:24] <jaspertheghost_> validate just attaches?
[16:53:24] <duch_kazatel> but that's not what i'm saying.
[16:53:40] <duch_kazatel> .validate() initializes the plugin on your form.
[16:53:44] <duch_kazatel> that's all calling that does.
[16:54:00] <duch_kazatel> it's meant to then be called every time you click submit - it then checks and does the rest for you.
[16:54:15] <jaspertheghost_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13671710/jquery-form-validation-on-button-click
[16:54:27] <duch_kazatel> i don't care about SO - i'm explaining how this plugin works ;)
[16:55:51] <duch_kazatel> that plugin ALSO has the ability to validate the form on button click, but that doesn't do you much good because you all ready have that functionality on the main submit button.
[17:12:06] <freebird2> I need help concatenating a var name x, to the name: states, in the end, can't do it, doesn't work, help please: var data = {data: [ 'Houston','Dallas', 'San Jose', 'Jacksonvile'],name: 'states'  + x};
[17:12:20] <duch_kazatel> you what now?
[17:12:21] <freebird2> http://jsfiddle.net/c85FS/
[17:12:39] <freebird2> can't get that simple + x to work man, lool
[17:12:43] <freebird2> tryed everything
[17:12:45] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[17:12:46] <duch_kazatel> what do you want that to do?
[17:13:30] <duch_kazatel> like, what do you expect that code to accomplish?
[17:13:32] <freebird2> each multi select must have an unique name, now, they all have the same name
[17:14:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i'm asking ;) what do you expect the code you just showed us to accomplish?
[17:14:27] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, in here: ,name: 'sabores' };   should be:    ,name: 'sabores1' };    ,name: 'sabores2' };   ,name: 'sabores3' };
[17:15:04] <freebird2> I want to give an unique name to each select generated
[17:15:06] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[17:15:13] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 you're changing your question.
[17:15:38] <freebird2> ok, I want to concatenate x to 'states'
[17:15:45] <freebird2> cksonvile'],name: 'states'  + x}; duc
[17:15:45] <duch_kazatel> 'states' + x
[17:15:49] <freebird2> doesn't work
[17:15:56] <duch_kazatel> what is 'x' set to?
[17:16:32] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, hmmm
[17:16:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/m9aKG/ start here - try to make this do what you want.
[17:16:43] <freebird2> any way, shows nothing
[17:16:44] <duch_kazatel> ignore your other stuff.
[17:17:00] <duch_kazatel> right, because name: 'states' + x; doesn't make sense.
[17:19:26] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,  this should work, I'm telling you, maybe because it's an array, not sure: http://jsfiddle.net/c85FS/3/
[17:19:39] <freebird2> FieldCount is setted,
[17:20:21] <duch_kazatel> stop showing me that fiddle.
[17:20:24] <duch_kazatel> narrow the problem down.
[17:20:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/m9aKG/ <- start here.
[17:22:18] <freebird2> is there an easyer way to accomplish that ?? I juist need unique name's,
[17:22:21] <freebird2> to them
[17:23:40] <mobile8> whats the best way to display icons if image sprites cannot be used?
[17:23:47] <duch_kazatel> unique name values you mean?
[17:25:42] <mobile8> icon font i mean
[17:25:57] <mobile8> i mean thats the only alternative to specifying each file for each icon seperately right>?
[17:26:42] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 are there multiple data objects all ready being stored.
[17:27:32] <freebird2> yes, but they have differente names, 2 of them are fix
[17:27:36] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[17:27:54] <freebird2> this, seems to work, but with wrong sequence: http://jsfiddle.net/c85FS/6/
[17:29:22] <freebird2> it worked
[17:29:54] <duch_kazatel> jesus stop sending me that.
[17:32:30] <Getty> what is jesus sending you?
[17:33:10] <duch_kazatel> hah
[17:39:35] <il> when I do $(".some-class").click(function(){ //things }); my function only targets the first class (out of 6). How can I make sure my function targets the specific element clicked?
[17:39:46] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, tks again man
[17:39:55] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ il
[17:39:56] <b-ot> il: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:40:33] <il> I'm working with a table that has private company data and signed an nda, not possible
[17:40:42] <il> I can do pastebin
[17:41:01] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what i'm looking for.
[17:41:08] <duch_kazatel> because i don't want the whole thing.
[17:42:25] <GuestUser123> $(this)
[17:42:51] <GuestUser123> if (!) return
[17:43:21] <duch_kazatel> il http://jsfiddle.net/SpeBD/1/
[17:43:32] <duch_kazatel> i was looking for a simplified example, like this.
[17:45:31] <duch_kazatel> il if your problem is that you're trying to do something to the element clicked, you need to target $(this) in your event handler, instead of the selector.
[17:52:01] <il_> here is the pastebin:
[17:52:22] <il_> http://pastebin.com/PW3TEvNp
[17:52:28] <duch_kazatel> did you read anything i posted?
[17:53:25] <il_> target $(this) in my event handler instead of the selector
[17:53:34] <duch_kazatel> all_visibility_buttons IS the one that was clicked - something tells me your markup has a problem.
[17:54:48] <il_> duch_kazatel, each individual visibility button has .visibility-button as a class
[17:54:50] <il_> there are 6
[17:55:01] <il_> I didn't want to have to right a function for each button
[17:55:07] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to.
[17:55:08] <il_> write*
[17:55:12] <duch_kazatel> did you look at my P.O.C.?
[17:55:22] <il_> I don't know what a P.O.C is
[17:55:28] <duch_kazatel> proof of concept.
[17:55:31] <duch_kazatel> the thing i posted to jsfiddle.
[17:55:35] <il_> Yea
[17:55:39] <il_> That works fine
[17:55:45] <il_> Even with the ids
[17:55:49] <il_> the fuck is wrong with my code
[17:56:03] <il_> is what I'm trying to figure out
[17:56:14] <duch_kazatel> you're being really roundabout with your code.
[17:56:30] <duch_kazatel> you're finding the button again when you all ready have it.
[17:56:46] <duch_kazatel> all_visibility_buttons IS the element.  why you're getting its ID and then selecting that ID makes no sense.
[17:57:37] <duch_kazatel> wait are you using the smae ID more than once?
[17:57:44] <GuestUser123> sory my pedancy
[17:57:49] <GuestUser123> lol
[17:58:51] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go home.
[17:59:29] <GuestUser123> man itold these idiots class is best selector
[18:00:03] <GuestUser123> also dont do button-blue
[18:00:15] <GuestUser123> do button blue
[18:01:00] <GuestUser123> separate

[18:38:56] <elinger> Greetings all, I have a quick question for whoever is active
[18:39:09] <Yarfuel> im doing something like that http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#items but i need to get all enabled items, how can i do it ????

[19:20:54] <antlong> is there a best practice for implementing modals that you page through? (via arrow keys, like click -> and it goes to the next modal)
[19:40:22] <damasceno> Hello, I have a HTML file named event.html and a .js which creates a listview with innerHTML, without load the jquery-mobile.js file from this .js file it doesn't work (The CSS style). If I load it from the JavaScript file the page simply reloads. Have anyone already had this kind of problem?
[19:45:10] <freebird2> I've read and tryed everything, I need to concatenate a function result to a string that is an array to a multiselect, have isolated the problem, http://jsfiddle.net/c85FS/13/  , i need to make data, understand that return and show the correct options, tks in advance
[20:10:30] <shoky> freebird2: f() returns a string, not an array
[21:10:01] <cam_y_> how'd you compute heights of stacked divs but with collapsible borders/margins ?
[21:11:23] <damasceno> Does anyone know why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/643fc/3/ I'm trying to create a listview with jquery mobile. Thanks.
[21:13:23] <shoky> damasceno:  http://jsfiddle.net/643fc/4/
[21:15:44] <damasceno> shoky: I've been trying to solve this since 8 p.m... man, thanks a million!
[21:47:13] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a way to have .show() and hide() just fade in rather than doing the slide and fade in thing
[22:03:37] <qle> hi
[22:03:37] <qle> in $.get
[22:03:44] <qle> if you do something in function() {}
[22:03:44] <qle> or .done
[22:03:49] <qle> whats the difference?
[22:04:28] <shoky> no difference. it's still a function() {}  when you pass it to .done
[22:04:38] <qle> i mean
[22:04:47] <shoky> .done is just more flexible, you can call it multiple times for example
[22:18:58] <Lindrian_> When I do $("#foo") I assume jquery does a document.getElementById(). Does it do this every time that is called or does it cache the result?
[22:25:31] <MACscr> Looking for a second set of eyes for my test code here: http://jsfiddle.net/yC9Wr/
[22:26:18] <MACscr> right now its not creating the correct number of clones of the code
[22:29:10] <mfoxdogg|work> woooooooooooooo ride the netsplit!!
[22:36:07] <shoky> Lindrian_: every time
[22:37:26] <Lindrian_> ew
[22:38:31] <shoky> MACscr: it's creating the right number of clones, you're just also showing the original row
[22:38:57] <shoky> MACscr: and well, if you change the number again then it clones all of $('.grades_container')
[22:39:19] <MACscr> so what do you think is the best way to do it?
[22:48:40] <shoky> MACscr: this is better .. works anyway  http://jsfiddle.net/yC9Wr/1/
[22:49:25] <MACscr> thanks so much. That works great
[22:54:53] <ornerymoose> Hi, Im using the jquery backstretch plugin for a background slideshow and am having a minor issue: When the page loads, I don’t want the first image (rainbow2) to fade in, I just want it to be set when the page loads, THEN for the slideshow to start. How would I accomplish this? http://codeshare.io/1N0cP
[23:17:06] <dylan9o4> hey anybody home?
[23:17:12] <duch_kazatel> i am.
[23:17:23] <dylan9o4> i dont know why this happens
[23:17:28] <dylan9o4> http://jsbin.com/laxih/1/edit
[23:17:48] <duch_kazatel> why what happens?
[23:17:56] <dylan9o4> on fadeIn the div is moved to the top then moved back under the image
[23:18:04] <dylan9o4> is there a way i can stop this?
[23:18:10] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?
[23:18:15] <dylan9o4> chrome
[23:18:37] <duch_kazatel> "moved to the top"... oh the z-index.
[23:19:16] <dylan9o4> well idk if jquery actually changes the zindex upon fadeIn, but essentially yes
[23:21:22] <dylan9o4> duch_kazatel: here its a bit easier to see http://jsbin.com/laxih/2/edit
[23:21:29] <duch_kazatel> i can see it now just fine.
[23:22:22] <duch_kazatel> check these out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7055269/jquery-fadein-on-positionabsolute-causes-z-index-issue
[23:22:31] <duch_kazatel> it's a positioning issue.
[23:28:43] <tuskkk___> what is QUnit?
[23:28:54] <duch_kazatel> tuskkk___ a unit testing framework
[23:29:08] <tuskkk___> I read that, but what does that mean?
[23:29:21] <duch_kazatel> it's a way to run automated testing on your code.
[23:29:42] <tuskkk___> and test what exactly?
[23:29:50] <naschine> that you can check if your assumptions are correct by testing a function with every possible value for example
[23:30:00] <duch_kazatel> usually, the return values based on input values.
[23:30:06] <naschine> and see if the result is what you've expected
[23:30:30] <tuskkk___> oh, so it can proofread my code on my website basically?
[23:30:36] <duch_kazatel> sort of.
[23:30:43] <tuskkk___> ok, thanks
[23:30:49] <tuskkk___> is it easy to use?
[23:30:50] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't read your code though.
[23:31:07] <duch_kazatel> it'll require that you write things a little differently.
[23:31:17] <duch_kazatel> http://qunitjs.com/intro/
[23:32:35] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:32:51] <tuskkk___> also
[23:33:11] <tuskkk___> can jquery be used in making java web apps?
[23:33:20] <duch_kazatel> errr....
[23:33:27] <duch_kazatel> not in the java part.
[23:33:33] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:33:36] <duch_kazatel> but the frontend can yes
[23:33:43] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:33:54] <tuskkk___> and is bootstrap similar to JQuery?
[23:33:57] <duch_kazatel> whatever winds up the page has to be HTML, CSS, or JS <- jquery is js.
[23:34:02] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap uses jquery.
[23:34:09] <tuskkk___> OK
[23:34:12] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap is a collection of controls and widgets and stuff.
[23:34:16] <duch_kazatel> as well as a grid.
[23:34:27] <tuskkk___> so its better than Jquery?
[23:34:35] <duch_kazatel> not in my opinion.
[23:34:40] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:34:41] <duch_kazatel> different purposes anyway\
[23:34:49] <tuskkk___> nice
[23:34:56] <tuskkk___> cool stuff all this is
[23:34:57] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a toolkit, bootstrap is an entire system to build on.
[23:35:12] <tuskkk___> I am almost done learning HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery
[23:35:26] <tuskkk___> oh ok
[23:36:11] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap automates a lot of things for you, but i personally don't like it because it requires you to basically do things the way they prescribe.  any customization is difficult.
[23:36:12] <tuskkk___> have you heard of node.js?
[23:36:16] <duch_kazatel> yes i have.
[23:36:21] <duch_kazatel> node.js is a very big deal.
[23:36:31] <tuskkk___> I want to learn it next
[23:36:39] <duch_kazatel> good
[23:36:41] <tuskkk___> I have heard it can deal with server
[23:36:53] <duch_kazatel> err, that's all it does.
[23:37:00] <duch_kazatel> node.js allows you to run javascript serverside.
[23:37:06] <tuskkk___> yea
[23:37:11] <tuskkk___> like PHP
[23:37:15] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[23:37:23] <tuskkk___> but I have no idea how it works right now :(
[23:37:41] <duch_kazatel> it's a simple idea really.  you lnow how javascript runs in the browser?
[23:38:01] <tuskkk___> yea, there is an engine that runs it
[23:38:34] <duch_kazatel> node.js uses the same engine as chrome.  instead of their being a DOM API, there's an API for working with networking and filesystems.
[23:38:56] <duch_kazatel> *there
[23:39:18] <tuskkk___> I can't think of how all this is connected, all the user sees is the page from a server
[23:39:35] <duch_kazatel> right - node generates html.
[23:39:38] <duch_kazatel> just like PHP does.
[23:39:41] <tuskkk___> does it manipulate the database also?
[23:39:46] <duch_kazatel> it can, yes.
[23:40:00] <tuskkk___> dang, this sounds complicated
[23:40:05] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest.
[23:40:11] <duch_kazatel> just another set of skills.
[23:40:16] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:40:37] <tuskkk___> are you an experienced programmer?
[23:42:59] <duch_kazatel> yes i am.
[23:43:16] <duch_kazatel> I'm a senior developer for a fairly large ecommerce company.
[23:44:29] <tuskkk___> Can you tell me what all technologies you learned on your way there?
[23:44:37] <serge> Hi. I  need a help with jQueryUI sortable. Here is what I currently have http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/6JjpU/3/ A problem described at jsfiddle. Thanks.
[23:44:38] <tuskkk___> Can I PM you?
[23:44:43] <duch_kazatel> tuskkk___ sure.
[23:45:06] <duch_kazatel> Sergonium okay - what JS do you have so far?
[23:46:19] <duch_kazatel> err, serge
[23:46:42] <serge> duch_kazatel, its commented at the bottom
[23:47:08] <serge> duch_kazatel, // (1)...... and // (2).....
[23:49:12] <duch_kazatel> so you need sortables in sortables, and sortables that are also draggable/droppable?
[23:52:33] <serge> duch_kazatel, yes, sortable inside sortable. I'm not sure about droppable. If you uncomment //(1) it makes possible to move imge from slide 2 to slide 1
[23:56:29] <dokma> I receive a bunch of paragraphs with a data-conversationkey="id" and need to dispatch each paragraph according to it's key. My first guess is .each but I have a feeling I should be able to separate paragraphs by keys in a more efficient manner?
[23:57:06] <duch_kazatel> dokma not following.  you want to iterate over paragraphs, right?
[23:57:25] <dokma> I want to separate them by their keys
[23:57:39] <dokma> let's say I have 5 paras and 2 have one key 3 another
[23:57:48] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ dokma
[23:57:49] <b-ot> dokma: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:57:53] <dokma> I want to separate them by keys and do something with those groups
[23:58:17] <duch_kazatel> you can select based on attribute values btw.
[23:58:17] <dokma> well... it won't do you much good
[23:58:18] <dokma> but ok
[23:58:34] <duch_kazatel> you can select based of that data attribute...
[23:58:35] <dokma> duch_kazatel, I need to group them not just select
[23:58:44] <duch_kazatel> define "Group
[23:58:57] <dokma> I get a bunch of paragraps with different keys
[23:59:11] <dokma> and I need to separate them by keys
[23:59:27] <duch_kazatel> okay.  define "separate".  is this a visual effect?
