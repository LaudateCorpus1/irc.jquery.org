[13:04:38] <tyrese> hey, if I have a click event on a <tr>, if a <td> has a <a> is it possible to make it so clicking the link does not trigger the parent click event handler?
[13:05:49] <robertmaxrees> yep - https://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler -> "event.target indicates the deepest (innermost) element where the event occurred."
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> so you can check the target to see if it's the anchor and, if so, return out or whatever.
[13:06:39] <robertmaxrees> or, if you have another handler bound to that anchor, you can call e.stopPropagation() and that'll prevent the event from bubbling.

[13:07:12] <tyrese> thank you, ill try that
[13:11:06] <tyrese> I call the function like $("#my-div").click(myFunction), is there a way if I do .click(function (e) { ... }) to pass the context into it like before?
[13:11:19] <tyrese> or do I need to create a parameter for the function and pass $(this)
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow the question.
[13:11:40] <robertmaxrees> could you make a jsfiddle?
[13:11:53] <tyrese> sure
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> having any issues? :)
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> tyrese are you asking if you can use e and/or $(this) if you bind like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4mc16onf/ ?
[13:26:00] <tyrese> https://jsfiddle.net/6a940o1k/
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> couple issues here.
[13:26:31] <robertmaxrees> 1: non-input elements don't have a val(), they have .text()
[13:26:34] <tyrese> actually, sorry https://jsfiddle.net/6a940o1k/1/
[13:27:19] <robertmaxrees> why would you do it that way and not just $("#my-div").click(example); ?
[13:27:46] <tyrese> to use event
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:27:58] <robertmaxrees> you still have access to the event object.
[13:28:01] <tyrese> oh wait..
[13:28:04] <tyrese> haha :)
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k1ypsdz3/1/
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> under the hood, jquery passes the event object to the callback for you.
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> just gotta use it.
[13:28:46] <tyrese> that's a really good point, no idea why i didnt realize that before
[13:28:48] <tyrese> thank you
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
