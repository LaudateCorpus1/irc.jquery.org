[06:33:25] <onizu> hi
[06:34:18] <onizu> I'm trying to change the colour of a <label>  text , selecting it by its 'for' attr, but it is not showing any effect
[06:56:52] <onizu> got it, nevermind.
[09:17:52] <t432> i'm using jquery ui's draggable to position the image in desired place. I am  saving the 'ui.position.top' value so I can automatically set the position in future page reloads, i tried the value using css top prop but this is not working (image. appears to go off screen) https://pastebin.com/vtBmwYie
[09:18:16] <t432> tried setting the value*
[09:18:43] <t432> css top prop here is probably wrong anyway..
[09:44:23] <t432> any sugestions?
[09:54:18] <Cork> t432: try taking subtracting the offsetParent() position from the value before setting it
[09:54:33] <Cork> position() is relative to the document not the offset parent
[09:54:55] <Cork> if you put the image as position: fixed the top should be correct
[09:55:04] <t432> cab i set the value on create? https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-create
[09:55:04] <Cork> but you normally don't want that
[09:55:18] <t432> image position is abs
[09:55:24] <Cork> don't remmember haven't used draggable in years on years
[09:55:32] <t432> can*
[09:55:41] <Cork> but i don't think so
[09:55:51] <t432>                        create: function( event, ui ) {
[09:55:52] <t432>                             ui.position.top = -845;
[09:55:53] <t432>                         },
[09:55:59] <t432> has no effect
[09:56:31] <Cork> t432: alternatively use ui.offset instad of ui.positon
[09:56:38] <Cork> as the former is most likely what you want
[09:56:59] <t432>  ui.offset = -845;?
[09:57:33] <Cork> uh offset and position is an object not a value
[09:58:02] <t432> does not work
[09:58:45] <Cork> what doesn't workd?
[09:58:47] <Cork> *work
[09:59:21] <t432> right
[09:59:46] <t432> i mean position is same
[09:59:49] <t432> as normal
[10:00:12] <Cork> you can't move an object by modifying the ui object
[10:00:45] <Cork> my point is you should save the offset not the position object
[10:01:45] <t432> here's what i'm tryiong to do https://w3lessons.info/facebook-style-cover-image-reposition-using-jquery-php/
[10:02:45] <t432> my code is same
[10:03:22] <Cork> take the ui.offset.top/left value, store that
[10:03:40] <Cork> one next load set that value for the object to restore the old position
[10:04:06] <Cork> the ui.position won't work for you cause it gives you a value related to the top left of the DOCUMENT
[10:07:56] <t432> why the left? image can be only dragged up/down
[10:20:34] <t432> Cork: offset is relative to the parent elem?
[10:20:46] <t432> not document?
[10:28:34] <t432> ah!
[10:28:39] <t432> that works
[10:28:43] <t432> thx, man
[10:38:18] <t432> Cork: one more thing, if I drag down long enough, it goes past the image where nothing but the default background is now visible (image moved all the way to top), how can i prevent the drag from going beyond the bottom of image?

[11:07:33] <t432> nvm
[17:46:44] <jeremyxwing> I'm trying to figure out a way to compare an incomplete string (from an input field) to a defined string as you type it, and to spit out an error the moment it strays from that defined stringed
[17:46:51] <jeremyxwing> Like you would in a typing test
