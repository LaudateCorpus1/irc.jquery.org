[00:46:23] <Vivekananda> easyOnMe, late night buddy. everyone must be asleep
[00:46:30] <Vivekananda> I am struggling with my issue :(
[00:48:00] <easyOnMe> Vivekananda: oh is i
[00:48:01] <easyOnMe> it
[00:48:05] <easyOnMe> I am from Asia man
[00:48:11] <easyOnMe> and you are from?
[00:48:26] <easyOnMe> Vivekananda: mind if you take a look at my code
[00:48:28] <easyOnMe> and see what is the issue
[00:48:39] <Vivekananda> lol the way you asked that question tells me you are from India :)
[00:48:48] <Vivekananda> or am I incorrect
[00:49:01] <Vivekananda> and also I am not an expert so might not be of any / much help
[00:49:23] <Vivekananda> your code looks simple enough. What is the question ?
[00:49:48] <easyOnMe> Vivekananda: the thing is the sticker div that is suppose to land on the boxes to the left does not do so
[00:49:56] <easyOnMe> I wonder what the problem is
[00:50:03] <easyOnMe> which part are you from India
[00:52:11] <Vivekananda> can't you make it a little easier with the colors ? it will be tough to for anyone looking to know what rgb 0, 234, 532 means right ?
[00:52:45] <Vivekananda> easyOnMe, hahaha. That should have been -- What part of India are you from ?
[00:54:25] <Vivekananda> ok so what is the problem again? stickers are to the left aren't they ?
[00:54:54] <Vivekananda> where should stickers be according to you ?
[00:54:59] <Vivekananda> easyOnMe,  ?
[00:59:12] <Vivekananda> easyOnMe, umm I have to go. if you wanted me to reply let me know
[00:59:43] <arc_> easyOnMe you have misspelled width in #container css
[01:01:07] <printForever> arc!
[01:01:08] <easyOnMe> arc_: what do you mean
[01:01:23] <arc_> i mean "width" is misspelled
[01:01:25] <printForever> arc_ I'm trying to figure out how is the content change inside the tab content area
[01:01:31] <printForever> arc_ https://www.veebimajutus.ee/domeeni-registreerimine/?domain=selleedomaain&tld=ee
[01:01:52] <arc_> so the 70px width is not being applied to that container
[01:02:23] <arc_> also, i believe the problem you are describing is that you cannot see the left side of the border
[01:02:33] <robert_> $.parseXML() is returning null when I try and parse this data- http://gxy.psiglenmere.com/drugList.xml
[01:02:35] <arc_> that is because the border appears on the outside of the box
[01:02:35] <easyOnMe> arc_: no
[01:02:54] <arc_> if you move the whole thing to the right 15 pixels, you will see the borders
[01:02:55] <easyOnMe> what I want is to allow sticker to get dropped on the two small boxes to the left
[01:02:59] <easyOnMe> to the right sorry
[01:03:10] <arc_> what do you mean get dropped on
[01:06:20] <arc_> actually, it seems like you have created the html and css and want someone to write the jquery for you, and i have no patience for that
[01:06:30] <easyOnMe> arc_: when I tried dropping the div with the .sticker class it does not get attached to the two small boxes to the right
[01:06:38] <easyOnMe> the div with the class .boxes
[01:06:48] <arc_> i don't know what you mean by dropping
[01:08:30] <easyOnMe> arc_: you know drag and drop right
[01:08:58] <easyOnMe> when I tried placing the div with the class .sticker to the div to the right the class of .boxes
[01:09:27] <easyOnMe> the div does not seem to be placed inside either of those two div when you drop the div wit the .sticker class
[01:09:37] <easyOnMe> do you understand what I mean
[01:09:43] <easyOnMe> drag and drop functionality
[01:11:00] <Vivekananda> easyOnMe, I am not sure if drag and drop is the correct analogy to apply to your situation. you are merely creating new divs and placing them at specific locations.
[01:11:29] <easyOnMe> Vivekananda: yes because to set them up first before any drag and drop can happen
[01:11:46] <easyOnMe> if you do not set them up then what will you drag and drop in the first place
[01:11:55] <arc_> okay, but you haven't done anything to make them draggable
[01:12:01] <arc_> so how are you testing this functionality that supposedly doesn't work
[01:12:14] <easyOnMe> I already did
[01:12:19] <arc_> where
[01:12:22] <easyOnMe> I already have my jquery code
[01:12:33] <easyOnMe> alright let me refresh the codepen
[01:13:10] <Vivekananda> arc_, do you understand what he means by drag and drop ? I know that one can come up with some code in jquery which actually allows dragging but I am not sure that is what he is referring to
[01:13:42] <Vivekananda> ok
[01:13:58] <Vivekananda> that would be better  ( to see the drag code you have)
[01:15:49] <arc_> ok, now we have an example that makes sense
[01:17:47] <easyOnMe> arc_: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MKwxjL
[01:18:32] <easyOnMe> the div with the class .sticker can be drag but once you drop it on one of the boxes it does not allow itself to be drop on another box
[01:20:30] <arc_> well, when you drag out, you are removing it
[01:21:36] <easyOnMe> arc_: but how come it does not allow for another drag and drop on another box when you have completed a drag and drop no the first box
[01:22:05] <easyOnMe> arc_: this is the new code:http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxVREx
[01:35:36] <easyOnMe> arc_: any ideas
[02:21:12] <realies> anyone not asleep? xD
[03:33:24] <Sergio_Ivanuzzo> hi all, can you advice me channel about angularjs >?
[03:55:57] <ace_me> Cork are you around ? :)
[03:57:10] <ace_me> I have a form which is submitted multiple times and so I end up having multiple records in db if I fastly click submit buitton https://gist.github.com/malutanpetronel/05e983610f5d0c28680c
[04:00:28] <Xatenev> ace_me: so?
[04:00:36] <Xatenev> ace_me: you want it to only be once clickable? or what
[04:19:14] <ace_me> Xatenev yes something like that
[04:19:24] <Xatenev> ace_me: .one
[04:19:32] <ace_me> I now get as many records as fast I can click on the submit button
[04:20:21] <ace_me> Xatenev .one what is it ?
[04:25:39] <Xatenev> ace_me: binds an event listener which juts fires once
[04:32:34] <realies> does someone know abour a js image slider that looks like this? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/25g9Lotz/IMG_0105.PNG
[04:49:53] <Voyage_> http://oi65.tinypic.com/r8s2ux.jpg  I have enabled headers and getting correct CORS in headers (access-control-allow-orig...	*) but still I cannot access the inner dome or page height of an iframe in side  a parent page. It says "Error: Permission denied to access property "document"" any clue?
[04:54:59] <Cork> Voyage_: cors doesn't enable you cross domain frame access
[04:55:38] <Voyage_> Cork: hm, how can I get the height then?
[04:55:41] <Cork> you could ajax get the html content and inject it into an iframe that points to about:blank though
[04:56:00] <Cork> Voyage_: sendMessage is prob the simplest solution
[04:56:06] <Cork> (have the page send it to you)
[04:56:23] <Cork> ah, sorry postMessage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[04:56:39] <Cork> isn't limited by cors
[04:57:28] <Cork> Voyage_: make sure to check the origin on both sides
[04:57:35] <Cork> else you are opening your self up for risk
[05:02:42] <Voyage_> Cork:  both sides?
[05:02:45] <sigdk> Hello. I'm trying to reproduce this example: https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/zero_configuration.html here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lc6esorg/  Any idea why I don't get the same result ?
[05:03:09] <easyOnMe> hello
[05:03:12] <Cork> Voyage_: the page that want to know the height needs to bind an event listener and in that event listener check the origin of the message
[05:03:19] <easyOnMe> I need some help
[05:03:22] <easyOnMe> this is the new code:http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxVREx
[05:03:30] <Cork> Voyage_: the other end needs to send the height and ensure to target the correct origin
[05:03:52] <easyOnMe> my issue is that I declared two divs as droppable but only one seems to accept the draggable class
[05:05:48] <Cork> sigdk: you're not including the datatable plugin (or jquery for that matter)
[05:06:05] <Voyage_> Cork:  how would the parent page know about the scroll bar or content/height of inner page?
[05:06:05] <easyOnMe> it is only the first box to the right accepts items dropped on it while the other does not even if they have the same class as droppable
[05:06:20] <sigdk> Cork, thank you
[05:06:25] <Voyage_> Cork:  this will help?http://davidjbradshaw.github.io/iframe-resizer/
[05:06:44] <Cork> Voyage_: like i said, when the inner page is resized it sends the new height to the origin
[05:08:23] <Voyage_> how can the outer page communicate with inner page for it to send its height???
[05:08:38] <Voyage_> Do I need to place any code in the inner page?
[05:08:39] <sigdk> Cork, this doesn't seem to be the problem. Still doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/Lc6esorg/1/
[05:08:48] <Cork> Voyage_: it could be as simple as $(window).resize(function() { window.postMessage(window.scrollMaxY, 'http;://parent.page.domain"); });
[05:08:52] <Cork> opps
[05:08:59] <Cork> Voyage_: * it could be as simple as $(window).resize(function() { window.postMessage(window.scrollMaxY, 'http;://parent.page.domain'); });
[05:09:17] <Cork> Voyage_: then the outer page just binds the message event
[05:09:20] <Cork> and checks the origin
[05:09:41] <Cork> sigdk: you still don't have jquery
[05:09:51] <Voyage_> Cork:  ok, so I need to send some message from INNER page to PARENT page?
[05:09:58] <Cork> yes
[05:10:14] <Voyage_> ok, and post that message?
[05:10:19] <Voyage_> wel
[05:10:35] <Voyage_> do I need to put cors on BOTH parent and inner page?
[05:10:43] <Cork> nether
[05:10:58] <Cork> window.postMessage is allowed corss origins by design
[05:11:03] <Voyage_> oh, so posMessage do not require any cors?
[05:11:08] <Voyage_> ok
[05:11:09] <Voyage_> great
[05:11:09] <Cork> it was added explicitly to allow sending messages cross origins
[05:11:29] <Cork> else you could just have done window.parent....
[05:11:39] <thorwell> does anyone know what is happening with jquery 3?
[05:12:09] <Voyage_> ok, so Now I only need a javascript to send post message from inner page to parent and the a javascript at parent page to get it, then resize the iframe to that height?
[05:12:22] <Cork> yup
[05:12:32] <Cork> and the line i gave you should get you quite a bit
[05:12:37] <Cork> +on the way
[05:12:42] <Voyage_> can you tell the brief message in plain javascript?
[05:12:46] <Cork> Voyage_: note message in postMessage has to be a string
[05:12:49] <sigdk> Cork, same: http://jsfiddle.net/Lc6esorg/2/
[05:12:55] <DelphiWorld> good morning
[05:13:00] <Cork> Voyage_: check the original link i gave you
[05:13:04] <Cork> it goes into details
[05:13:08] <Voyage_> ok
[05:13:22] <Cork> but the idea is to just bind the resize event on the inner page
[05:13:34] <Cork> and that should be all you need
[05:13:45] <Cork> you might have to send it on load too
[05:13:53] <Cork> as the page might not be resized there
[05:13:58] <Cork> but other then that it should be all you need
[05:14:15] <Cork> (you might want to use json to allow for future needs btw)
[05:14:47] <Cork> something like JSON.stringify({ pageHeight: window.scrollMaxY })
[05:18:52] <Voyage_>  Cork  question: Can I keep on sending messages to the parent page and the parent can keep on resizing the iframe? e.g parent loads the iframe and it gets resized but user clicks another link inside the iframe; new page loads, now this page again has to send a new postMessage to parent for it to resize it again. True?
[05:19:35] <Cork> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/Lc6esorg/3/
[05:19:42] <Cork> you need to include jquery before the plugin
[05:19:57] <Cork> Voyage_: yes
[05:20:08] <Cork> it is events similar to click and the like
[05:20:18] <sigdk> Cork, thanks
[05:25:36] <Voyage_> Cork:  cool
[05:27:42] <Voyage_> Cork:  If I don't want to use query, how to send a post message by simple javascript (I guess I need to do that when page is ready and dom is loaded fully).  window.postMessage(message, targetOrigin, [transfer]);
[05:29:20] <Voyage_> Cork:  sorry, neverming for the stupid question
[05:47:34] <easyOnMe> can someone help me
[05:47:35] <easyOnMe> http://jsfiddle.net/2cmu2jqr/2/
[05:48:01] <easyOnMe> I wanted the yellow div to append to the two green boxes below
[05:48:12] <easyOnMe> kindly see what I did wrong with my jquery
[05:48:16] <easyOnMe> thank you in advance
[05:49:26] <easyOnMe> hi
[05:49:29] <easyOnMe> mind if I ask for help
[05:49:31] <easyOnMe> thank you
[06:07:05] <KidKud> Uptime, ...
[06:30:53] <Voyage_> Just to be sure, does javascript <script> tags or jquery work outside or before the <html> tags?
[06:32:33] <KidKud> i think there is a thing that if you put the javascript <script> thing at the bottom, the DOM loads first. but if you put it in your <head> the script runs before the DOM
[06:33:32] <KidKud> Voyage_, ^
[06:36:34] <Voyage_> looks like my custom module in drupal is adding query (I coded it) at the start of document before html and its not running.
[06:37:20] <easyOnMe> sorry to bother again but I have been waiting for an hour now
[06:37:20] <easyOnMe> please help me with this code
[06:37:30] <easyOnMe> http://jsfiddle.net/2cmu2jqr/2/
[06:37:50] <easyOnMe> I wanted the yellow div to append to the two green boxes below
[06:38:01] <easyOnMe> kindly see what I did wrong with my jquery
[06:38:39] <KidKud> Voyage_, try putting it at the bottom and see if that works then
[06:40:28] <Voyage_> KidKud:  the module loads all things before anything happens
[06:41:04] <KidKud> oh. well i dont know then
[06:41:05] <KidKud> sorry
[07:12:25] <hellyeah> hey
[07:12:34] <hellyeah> if i create two json object
[07:12:43] <hellyeah> can i add the second one as tail of first one
[07:14:11] <Cork> hellyeah: no, you have to parse the data and merge them, then serialize it again
[07:14:43] <hellyeah> iis that a good idea?
[07:19:02] <Cork> hellyeah: not sure what you mean by good idea
[07:19:27] <hellyeah> is it effective? performamnce friendly, good practice etc.
[07:19:50] <Cork> well it is string parsing converting to a normal object
[07:19:59] <Cork> then merging or copying that data
[07:20:09] <Cork> followed by serializing that back to json
[07:20:26] <Cork> the question is why you feel you need to have it as json
[07:20:40] <hellyeah> ic
[07:20:52] <hellyeah> because i will transfer value to backend
[07:21:02] <hellyeah> and as far as i know the way for doing this is to use json
[07:21:04] <Cork> then why not just do that before you serialize it?
[07:21:50] <hellyeah> tranfer normal string to backend
[07:21:52] <hellyeah> ?
[07:22:49] <Cork> no
[07:23:09] <Cork> i hope your not generating the json by hand?
[07:23:20] <Cork> meaning contacting { and } into a string?
[07:24:10] <hellyeah> well i plan to create a string
[07:24:17] <hellyeah> then put that string into json
[07:24:26] <Cork> uh
[07:24:29] <Cork> put it into json?
[07:24:31] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:24:38] <hellyeah> i mean
[07:24:39] <Cork> are you talking about objects?
[07:24:40] <hellyeah> parse
[07:24:41] <Cork> and not json?
[07:24:44] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[07:24:52] <hellyeah> JSON.parse(string);
[07:25:00] <Cork> { key: "value" } <-- object
[07:25:01] <hellyeah> my english is bad sorry
[07:25:09] <Cork> '{ "key": "value" }' <-- json
[07:25:31] <Cork> hellyeah: well how are you planing to generate the string?
[07:25:56] <hellyeah> hard coded
[07:26:06] <Cork> uh, what?
[07:26:39] <Cork> why hardcode a json string if you could just use an object directly?
[07:27:30] <hellyeah> hmm i am kinda confused
[07:27:44] <hellyeah> i guess i need a proper format to generate json object
[07:27:57] <Cork> hellyeah: you need to learn what is what first
[07:28:08] <Cork> json is a string, with a specific structure
[07:28:14] <Cork> there are nothing called json object
[07:28:14] <hellyeah> yes
[07:28:35] <Cork> and object is the same structure as you can use in json
[07:28:49] <Cork> var o = { "key":"value" }; o.key == "value"
[07:29:03] <Cork> var o = JSON.parse('{ "key":"value" }'); o.key == "value"
[07:29:17] <Cork> so if you want to hard code the data don't go the round about way over json
[07:29:31] <Voyage_> Cork:  need you help... am stuck since a long time.  http://pastie.org/10625170
[07:30:06] <hellyeah> ic
[07:30:09] <Cork> Voyage_: line 10 isn't using origin
[07:30:15] <Cork> it uses a full url
[07:30:24] <Cork> http://192.168.0.77:8080 is the origin
[07:30:55] <Voyage_> so I should skip the /developers part
[07:30:57] <Voyage_> ok
[07:31:00] <Cork> ya
[07:31:14] <DelphiWorld> yo
[07:31:22] <DelphiWorld> how to assign a icon to a button?
[07:31:34] <Cork> define button
[07:31:53] <DelphiWorld> example:
[07:31:53] <DelphiWorld> <a class="button" id="prev">Prev</a>
[07:32:03] <Voyage_> Cork:  still no message
[07:32:06] <DelphiWorld> this is inside a div
[07:32:06] <DelphiWorld> <div class="button-bar">
[07:32:28] <Cork> DelphiWorld: so button is just an element you consider to be a button?
[07:32:39] <DelphiWorld> yes
[07:32:48] <Cork> well then you can't assign it an icon
[07:32:48] <DelphiWorld> produced using ionic, Cork
[07:32:57] <DelphiWorld> strange
[07:33:00] <Cork> ah, then your asking in the wrong channel
[07:33:12] <Cork> ask in a related channel
[07:33:16] <DelphiWorld> i want to assign it dynamicaly
[07:33:18] <DelphiWorld> using jquery
[07:33:37] <Cork> ya, but that require knowing what assigning the icon means
[07:33:42] <Cork> and that isn't jquery related
[07:34:08] <Cork> it is prob something related to .addClass or .prop or .attr
[07:34:20] <Cork> but without knowing the environment one can't say what
[07:35:48] <Voyage_> Cork:  any clues/
[07:36:18] <Cork> Voyage_: not really no, sorry
[07:36:49] <Voyage_> the placement of code and syntax is ok? secondly , any debuting tools that can monitor for any incoming messages?
[07:37:29] <Cork> Voyage_: well i would prob bind the message event as early as possible
[07:37:35] <Cork> just so you don't miss the event from the iframe
[07:40:26] <Voyage_> Cork:  just placed the receiver script of parent and top (before <bodY>) but no progress
[07:44:35] <Voyage_> my postMessage is not working. Any guesses why?  http://pastie.org/10625195   <-new paste
[07:51:09] <Cork> Voyage_: and http://192.168.0.72/documentation2  (you missed the .0 there) is in an iframe on http://192.168.77:8080/developers?
[07:51:38] <Voyage_> Cork:  do I need popup.postMessage  or window.postMessage?
[07:51:58] <Cork> window.postMessage if it is from inside that page
[07:53:34] <Cork> Voyage_: http://codepen.io/matt-west/full/lpExI
[07:54:38] <Cork> hmm opps that example goes the wrong direction
[07:57:25] <Cork> hmm
[07:57:34] <Cork> ah, i think i mixed things up a bit...
[07:58:51] <Cork> Voyage_: i lied for you a little bit
[07:58:54] <Cork> Voyage_: https://jsfiddle.net/dkj7qw7y/
[07:58:59] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/reuyfqgw/ <--
[07:59:10] <Cork> the inner page should use window.parent.postMessage
[07:59:21] <Cork> to post the message to the parent page
[07:59:32] <Cork> I had totally forgotten that
[08:01:00] <tb_b_> hi, how can i prevent a page stop a function which makes a refresh of the site and it is triggered by settimeout
[08:01:21] <tb_b_> i can inject code after the site has loaded with a browser plugin
[08:01:42] <Cork> tb_b_: unless you can get access to the function in question there isn't much you can do
[08:01:54] <Cork> you can tell the browser to not allow page reloads
[08:02:53] <ExtraSteve> You could write a browser plugin which would search for that bit of code in question
[08:02:59] <ExtraSteve> But that's not really a jquery question :p
[08:03:22] <Cork> actually...
[08:03:35] <Cork> man i did this a year ago...
[08:04:26] <tb_b_> Cork: okay, i will give it a try
[08:04:33] <Cork> there it is
[08:04:38] <Cork> tb_b_:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/beforescriptexecut
[08:04:52] <Cork> you could use that to prevent the script section from executing
[08:04:55] <Voyage_> Cork:  meanwhile I was coding, this helped http://stackoverflow.com/a/15601531
[08:05:15] <Cork> Voyage_: you got it working?
[08:05:25] <Voyage_> Cork:  yes
[08:05:30] <Voyage_> by this syntax http://stackoverflow.com/a/15601531
[08:05:30] <Cork> nice
[08:05:43] <Voyage_> thanks for the tips. You gave it in the first place!
[08:10:38] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[08:20:23] <sigdk> Here I load the data for each tab, whenever they are clicked: http://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/9/ The problem is that when the page first loads, the first tab is empty. Is there any way to load the data for this case without waiting for a click event ?
[08:30:38] <jquery046> Anyone up?
[08:31:02] <jquery046> I need help
[08:40:44] <exxy-> Okay.  So, I am rendering HTML from an AJAX call.  If I want to execute javascript on those results when they appear, other than the callback from the AJAX call, what other options do I have?  Since.. the DOM has already registered the js code at this point.
[08:41:10] <taplar> you want to register it in the method that adds the markup
[08:41:32] <exxy-> You mean the callback on the AJAX call?
[08:41:35] <taplar> yes
[08:41:37] <exxy-> Are there annnnny other options?
[08:41:43] <taplar> not any better ones
[08:41:51] <exxy-> I tried a method where I checked DOMInserted and executed code if the id of the element was what I wanted
[08:41:57] <exxy-> but it felt dirty.
[08:42:05] <taplar> why do you not want to use the callback?
[08:42:08] <exxy-> So the callbacks are the only way.
[08:42:37] <exxy-> I feel like registering the same callbacks everywhere is against DRY
[08:42:44] <exxy-> because I have a lot of AJAX calls
[08:42:51] <taplar> so extract them to functions
[08:42:54] <taplar> the callbacks that is
[08:43:02] <exxy-> I will do that
[08:43:08] <exxy-> Thanks for your advice :D
[08:43:11] <taplar> sure
[08:44:00] <Vivekananda> hi
[08:44:04] <taplar> morning
[08:44:09] <Vivekananda> I am stuck with another but similar problem
[08:44:40] <Vivekananda> robert pointed me to some ideas but I confess I neither understood him clearly nor am able to follow him.
[08:44:52] <Vivekananda> any chance someone can take a stab at it again ?
[08:45:04] <taplar> what do you got and what about it confuses you?
[08:45:34] <Vivekananda> taplar, nevermind that. If we discuss it we will waste and hour and just get back to here.
[08:45:41] <Vivekananda> would help to take a fresh look
[08:45:56] <Voyage_> is there something wrong with this? var iframe = getElementById("ifrm"); iframe.style.height = (height+200p)+"px";    It says SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal
[08:46:11] <Vivekananda> in case you would like to take a look. --
[08:46:14] <Vivekananda>  I am working on a live dashboard (bought). Trying to get realtime values in it and basically work out how to refresh the graphs( have it up live if you want to see). not a working fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/osr6L9tL/ . Earlier I could change the value of a bar or line chart and run a script "runAllCharts" and all graphs would refresh, however pie charts here aren't refreshing even though the values get updated
[08:46:15] <Vivekananda> in
[08:46:15] <Vivekananda> the div. Also here is the runallCharts (box 2) -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/90c47b45f8ad74f117a4  and here is the live site --http://c3d977cd.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/Developer/AJAX_version/#ajax/dashboard.html
[08:46:59] <taplar> Voyage_: height +200p looks weird
[08:47:34] <Voyage_> taplar:  200 + "px"
[08:48:03] <taplar> what is 'height'?
[08:49:07] <Voyage_> taplar:  1111
[08:49:11] <Voyage_> taplar:  I also removed px
[08:49:20] <taplar> so it's a variable?
[08:50:24] <Voyage_> taplar:  now it says ReferenceError: getElementById is not defined
[08:50:38] <taplar> document.get...
[08:51:02] <taplar> or $('#ifrm')
[08:52:00] <taplar> Vivekananda: if you could make a fiddle of just the issue, that would be really helpful
[08:52:41] <Voyage_> taplar:  oh ok.
[08:53:14] <Voyage_> I have an <iframe id="ifrm"  but running this now gives not errors but it does not changes the height of that iframe. why is that?
[08:53:29] <taplar> Voyage_: what is your code line now?
[08:53:38] <Vivekananda> taplar, yeah I was trying to but honestly if I was successful then I could solve the issue myself. :). It includes custom classes from the app. I tried to make one but I will try again
[08:54:19] <Vivekananda> taplar, btw as far as I understand everything has to do with the runallCharts jquery code.
[09:14:44] <netSys> Hi, How I can perform same function $("#delete-button").click(function(){ alert("say"}); for a lot of buttons with same id (delete-button). Because, when I push someone button, returns alert. But, when I try to push another button, It event does not occur.
[09:15:14] <taplar> netSys: you'll have to look them up differently
[09:15:20] <netSys> Sorry, only happend at first button, another button does not get it
[09:15:32] <taplar> easy solution is to put a class on them and look them up by that
[09:15:37] <taplar> ids are unique to a page
[09:16:28] <netSys> oh, thanks taplar
[09:16:33] <netSys> that's works heh
[09:16:53] <taplar> ids are unique identifiers.  if they could match on multiple things, they wouldn't be identifiers, :)
[09:18:19] <km4>  right ;)
[09:19:19] <km4> you can write this $('.btn').on('click', function () { alert('click'); }
[09:41:23] <hassoon> when sending a post query to some php file through jquery's $.ajax({}); function, are the arguments auto-encoded unlike when using the native js syntax, where i always need to do encodeURIComponent(var_name) for the xmlhttp object ?
[09:41:58] <taplar> data will be encoded for you
[09:42:00] <hassoon> so I can send data containing irregular characters
[09:42:07] <hassoon> taplar: ah
[09:42:36] <taplar> to the point that it conforms to the expected format that allows for the key=value&key2=value2 format
[09:43:03] <hassoon> the string format
[09:43:05] <hassoon> :)
[09:43:14] <taplar> key value format
[09:43:17] <taplar> but ya
[09:44:09] <taplar> if you use the 'json' option of dataType then ajax will also do the json encoding/decoding for you
[09:44:31] <hassoon> taplar: i see, interesting
[09:57:05] <Vivekananda> taplar, any advice for me ?
[09:57:12] <Vivekananda> I am trying in the meantime to get a fiddle working
[09:58:03] <Vivekananda> Also a funny thing. The docs for easy pie chart do mention an initialize function -- http://rendro.github.io/easy-pie-chart/ . but the runallCharts() in the code does that too. Why would it not initialize the pie on rerunning it I wonder
[10:01:10] <SirLagz> can anyone recommend a library to emulate a spreadsheet online ? I'm playing around with Handsontable but the documentation is lacking somewhat
[10:04:50] <shoky> Vivekananda: the docs also mention an "update" method and they say that's what you need to use when updating it..  "initialize" is something you should only run once , to initialize..
[10:05:08] <shoky> but robert has already been telling you this for days.. so.. :|
[10:07:35] <Vivekananda> shoky, yeahhhh . shoky the thing is robert was indeed telling me something and I feel bad that I made him spend time but nto follow him but the thing is I wasn't quite sure what he was saying.
[10:08:00] <shoky> Vivekananda: the docs tell you "If you want to update the current percentage of the a pie chart, you can call the update method."
[10:08:01] <Vivekananda> he said -- initialize a couple of times but when I said the function they have initializes itself then he said I conflated his ideas
[10:08:21] <Vivekananda> yes shoky I just saw that too and I am working on that right now as we speak
[10:08:27] <Vivekananda> and good thing I saw the docs :).
[10:08:35] <shoky> good thing you saw the docs?
[10:08:43] <shoky> that's not the approach to take
[10:08:51] <shoky> you should ALWAYS look at the docs, first thing.
[10:10:32] <Vivekananda> shoky, no I meant it is a good thing I saw the docs for the plugins and found and update method. Till now I was reluctant to introduce my own code in the dashboard and was trying to find if the maker of the dash have written their own 'custom updater/initializer'. If I use that then I will mess up the docs the least and seniors want it ( the dash) to be upgradeable. If it were not so I would readily have introduced custom
[10:10:32] <Vivekananda> code and made changes
[10:11:14] <Vivekananda> s/mess up the docs/mess up the dashboard /
[10:11:23] <shoky> well if this dash whatever has docs.. i'd look there too ;p
[10:13:32] <Vivekananda> shoky, looking 'there' is what is having all this nighmare. They had just one initiliazer and I used that and robert kept telling me to do a re initialize. !! Though in my defense he could have said to look at an update function and not a reinitialize coz that word kept confusing things. To me it appeared that if a function is already there to 'initialize' then what is the harm in calling it again so it 'Re initializes'.
[10:13:32] <Vivekananda> But at this point robert mentioned that I didn't understand him
[10:48:33] <buddyq> hey guys, having an issue with a jquery overlay not showing when submitting a form.
[10:49:50] <buddyq> my process is <a href=“#” onclick=“ submitbutton(‘saveSlave’)”>Save</a>   >>>   in the function do some form checking and jQuery(“#message”).overlay();   submitform(‘button’);
[10:50:23] <buddyq> if I comment out submitform line, the message shows but the form does not submit. Otherwise, it submits the form but you cannot see the overlay
[11:04:07] <taplar> buddyq: do you have fiddle showing your issue?  also you should avoid using onclick
[11:04:55] <buddyq> actually, I just discovered the problem only exists in Safari.
[11:04:59] <buddyq> it works fine in Chrome.
[11:11:19] <exxy-> Is there like a golden fucking guide to floating/aligning divs
[11:11:30] <exxy-> I need to sit down and memorize every word
[11:11:37] <taplar> lol
[11:11:41] <taplar> maybe try #css
[11:11:47] <exxy-> Oh, yeah.
[11:11:49] <exxy-> Sorry. lol
[11:12:04] <taplar> np
[11:12:30] <exxy-> lmfao, in their FAQ they have exactly what I need
[11:12:35] <exxy-> so glad I didn't blast off the question
[11:14:47] <Vivekananda> exxy-, out of curiousity what wree you looking at and what was the issue
[11:15:45] <exxy-> Vivekananda: I don't JS/CSS very often and when I do I always f'up the like [ <div here>            <div here>             <div here> ]
[11:15:54] <Vivekananda> taplar, is there a simpler way to get to the inner span than the first jquery ? http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/r9dsov0d/2/
[11:16:24] <Vivekananda> exxy-, in my limited knowledge I found bootstrap to help a lot there than just handcoding things
[11:16:36] <taplar> Vivekananda: you don't have to give it the entire tree
[11:16:55] <Vivekananda> taplar, I am trying the second one too an dthat doesn't work
[11:17:10] <taplar> your doing > which is direct descendent
[11:17:14] <taplar> of which it is not
[11:17:33] <exxy-> Vivekananda: I am using that, pull-left, pull-right work, but it makes the centered text (text-align: center) not-so-center anymore
[11:17:36] <Vivekananda> so .children() then ?
[11:17:40] <taplar> no just take > out
[11:17:45] <Vivekananda> hahahah ok
[11:17:55] <taplar> you understand what that's doing?
[11:18:23] <Vivekananda> this -- ?  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/r9dsov0d/3/
[11:18:55] <Vivekananda> taplar, I thought it would take all children and grandchildren into account. I am wrong coz it does only children
[11:19:04] <Vivekananda> but not having any > doesn't work either
[11:19:13] <taplar> your setting border color only
[11:19:19] <taplar> it may not have a width or style
[11:20:16] <taplar> do your css set like your doing in the first try
[11:22:31] <Vivekananda> yep that works thanks
[11:22:32] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/r9dsov0d/5/
[11:22:45] <Vivekananda> so border has to be given the width and the double then
[11:22:57] <Vivekananda> hmm lemme see css border
[11:23:52] <taplar> also if your doing to do something like that i would suggest storing the ul in a variable and using eq() off of that to get the elements your changing
[11:23:56] <taplar> saves a dom lookup
[11:24:09] <taplar> doing=going
[11:25:30] <taplar> actually it'd be the divs, not the ul, :/
[11:26:40] <taplar> but all that aside.  you know you could do all of that in pure css, no?
[11:27:24] <Vivekananda> taplar, so you mean dynamically change things by assigning flags to css itself ?
[11:27:33] <taplar> hold on
[11:28:04] <Vivekananda> as a use case. if div has 2 words make border green if 3 red and if 4 send email
[11:28:21] <Vivekananda> that will be tough to do on a css
[11:32:06] <Vivekananda> taplar, okay holding on :). I might fall though as cannot hold for much longer !!............
[11:32:16] <exxy-> Vivekananda: Oh duh.  I'll just us row-fluid and some spans.. (2.3.2)
[11:32:20] <taplar> sorry, fiddle was being mean to me
[11:32:29] <Vivekananda> lol
[11:32:34] <Vivekananda> exxy-, ^^
[11:32:53] <Vivekananda> taplar, still holding ....... you seen cliffhanger I hope ( the stallone movie)
[11:33:14] <exxy-> Vivekananda: Do you ever find that like.. everything is so big in bootstrap?
[11:33:22] <exxy-> Vivekananda: Like it's beautiful, but everything is so large.
[11:34:00] <Vivekananda> exxy-, yeah if I have to minimize something custom it is tough
[11:34:07] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/u0as9oc0/
[11:34:08] <Vivekananda> but it does a decent job of scaling though
[11:34:25] <exxy-> Vivekananda: I was about to ask, what if I set the scale of the body to like.. less than 1.0
[11:34:30] <Vivekananda> I did have a tonne of problems scaling some icons and getting them to work in a smaller frame
[11:34:55] <exxy-> Vivekananda: I work for a local gov't and none of my forms look anything like what they used before.  So little information available at once, always have to scroll
[11:35:17] <Vivekananda> exxy-, hmm ok I understand what you are saying
[11:35:40] <Vivekananda> so you want data intensive page with non bloated floats and wells etc
[11:35:46] <exxy-> exactly
[11:35:56] <Vivekananda> yeah for something like that bootstrap straps on its boot and runs
[11:35:57] <exxy-> gutters are so liberal, font feels like it's 14pt default or something too
[11:35:58] <Vivekananda> hahaha
[11:36:24] <exxy-> wow it IS defaulted at 14px
[11:36:26] <exxy-> jesus that's large
[11:36:43] <Vivekananda> taplar, I see that and that would absolutely work had my use case been of static data. Currently the colors change every few secs / mins so I will still have to use jquery :)
[11:37:06] <taplar> that's cool.  just wanted to suggest it
[11:37:19] <taplar> sometimes people get hung up on doing everything with js, :)
[11:38:39] <Vivekananda> exxy-, let me show my page but please note that it might ask you to register a gmail and you can decline. Just start narrowing it ( across width) and see what happens to the main bar ( not the nav)
[11:38:43] <Vivekananda> http://sandbox.safeview.com/index.php
[11:39:31] <Vivekananda> taplar, so 1. do I get any benefits doing css with my use case ?  2. if I have tto use jq for my case should I still store the ul / div / something  before hand ?
[11:39:52] <exxy-> Vivekananda: Yeah that looks good, using all bootstrap media queries or some of your own?
[11:42:00] <Vivekananda> exxy-, mostly bootstrap and not it is quite bad
[11:42:34] <Vivekananda> what I was hinting at was the blue icon bloats up a lot when you slowly narrow it and track what happens to it
[11:42:41] <Vivekananda> then shrinks again !! lol
[11:43:01] <taplar> Vivekananda: if by #1 you mean use stylesheets vs inline styling.  stylesheets are a bit cleaner, and classes are easier to 'undo'
[11:43:18] <taplar> for #2 any time you can reduce the number of dom calls you should
[11:43:56] <Vivekananda> taplar, no for 1 ( I understand that stysheets are always better) but 1 is useful only when static changes are needed which isn't my case.
[11:44:25] <Vivekananda> taplar, but for 2. should I also not worry about the amount of memory I am using to say save the whole dom ?
[11:44:38] <exxy-> taplar: If you have 1 thing ... 1 thing in a seaaaa of crazy things, that you want to text-align:left ... should you make a separate style for that element?
[11:44:41] <Vivekananda> but interesting that you said that I will note it down
[11:44:45] <DelphiWorld> hi
[11:44:59] <taplar> your not saving the whole dom, just the elements your accessing repeatedly
[11:45:03] <DelphiWorld> is it pocible to change a element css class up on click?
[11:45:05] <taplar> the dom is already in memory
[11:45:13] <DelphiWorld> for example
[11:45:34] <DelphiWorld> i am assigning a image into a element as a background using css, but i want it to change up on clicking it
[11:46:01] <taplar> exxy-: it's situational.  i might argue for something like that you could have a class 'alignLeft' and just stick that guy on it.  it could also be reused
[11:46:32] <Vivekananda> taplar, another question. suppose I save element x with id x in a variable. The element then changes inside but id remains same. If I use that variable to make a second set of changes to x will I be able to see the first set of changes by looking at the variable ?  No right ?
[11:47:21] <taplar> jquery objects are references i believe
[11:47:27] <taplar> changes to them will be reflected
[11:47:40] <taplar> easy enough to test
[11:48:29] <taplar> DelphiWorld: sure, what are you trying to do?
[11:49:05] <DelphiWorld> taplar: i have a button with a background image
[11:49:21] <DelphiWorld> i want if i click the button, i change the background image to a new one
[11:49:30] <DelphiWorld> i have the click event, but no idea how to restyle it
[11:49:57] <taplar> so you'd bind on('click') and in the handler you'd change $(this).css('background-image', whatever);
[11:50:18] <DelphiWorld> woo, let me see
[11:50:21] <Vivekananda> taplar, yeah I am going to make a fiddle to do that or actually I can test it in the other one itself
[11:52:22] <DelphiWorld> taplar: $(this).css(background: url('../img/pause.png') no-repeat);
[11:52:29] <DelphiWorld> taplar: should i add ";" after no-repeat?
[11:52:59] <taplar> $(this).css('background', "url('../img/pause.png') no-repeat");
[11:53:26] <DelphiWorld> thank taplar !
[11:53:28] <taplar> generically: $(selector).css(key, value)
[11:54:28] <taplar> i agree shoky the local storage crap with jsfiddle is bugging me today
[11:55:42] <shoky> ;x
[11:55:58] <Vivekananda> yep taplar you are right . references http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/ha7650g6/
[11:56:10] <taplar> did you find a way to make it stop?  i thought someone mentioned that there was something you could click to get a new one
[11:56:46] <Vivekananda> taplar, where did you find that hint for jquery ? Is there a forum ?
[11:56:47] <taplar> Vivekananda: :)
[11:57:00] <taplar> just through using it
[11:57:13] <taplar> it may be mentioned some where
[11:57:18] <taplar> but it makes sense
[11:57:28] <robertmaxrees> which hint?
[11:57:41] <shoky> taplar nope but ctrl-z seems to at least erase the content of the frame you're in
[11:57:56] <shoky> shorter than ctrl-a + delete  :\
[11:58:06] <taplar> jQuery objects reference the dom elements, so changes to them outside of the variable will still be reflected in the jQuery object
[11:58:30] <taplar> cool
[11:59:32] <robertmaxrees> taplar ah, yeah.  they probably leverage the fact that most DOM element references are "live"
[12:13:32] <stan_man_can_> I have a div that I need to be able to add/remove classes from. $(".expanded").addClass("collapsed").removeClass("expanded")  as well as the opposite $(".collapsed").addClass("expanded").removeClass("collapsed") but of course as soon as I dynamically add the class to it it's not selectable anymore....
[12:13:54] <taplar> add a non-changing class to it
[12:13:55] <robertmaxrees> give it a class that you never add or remove.
[12:13:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:13:57] <taplar> or id
[12:14:03] <robertmaxrees> :) otherwise, store a reference in a variable.
[12:14:27] <DelphiWorld> out of subject: what do opacity mean in css?
[12:14:34] <taplar> clarity
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> transparency.
[12:14:39] <DelphiWorld> thank
[12:15:08] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=css+opacity ;)
[12:15:19] <taplar> stan_man_can_: is your logic apart of some sort of toggle?
[12:15:52] <taplar> cause if you did that logic in a bound event, you wouldn't have to look it up
[12:15:54] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, not asking for help;) but see fprogress from yesterday... http://paste.debian.net/343350/
[12:16:14] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld lol i'm not really keeping track, but glad you're making progress.
[12:16:30] <DelphiWorld> yes... its totaly functional
[12:16:35] <stan_man_can_> taplar: Well I have a DIV, and inside that div there's <div class='parent'> and <div class='child'>, clicking the parent will expand/collapse the child
[12:16:53] <stan_man_can_> but there's also an expand/collapse all button that can toggle all children
[12:17:05] <taplar> of multiple parents?
[12:17:15] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can_ sounds like you need to make slightly more semantic markup then.
[12:18:03] <stan_man_can_> taplar: Yeah there's no real limit on how many parent/child groupings are on the page, it depends how many products the user adds
[12:18:06] <robertmaxrees> use semantic classes - one that describes WHAT that element is and then other classes to describe status/actions/etc.
[12:19:25] <Vivekananda> taplar, btw if the variables do store references only then doesn't that mean that each call to it will actually read the dom again for newer data ? if so how does storing an element in a var cause less dom lookups ?
[12:19:43] <taplar> you already have the reference
[12:20:16] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: Hmm, alrighty, thanks
[12:20:21] <taplar> sizzle doesn't have to find it again
[12:24:51] <DelphiWorld> what's the best way to fast forward & rewin in a audio element?
[12:25:26] <MikeD_> is there a way to detect if the browser (in this case IE10) is in a fullscreen/maximized view?
[12:25:46] <stan_man_can_> yeah that worked
[12:26:11] <DelphiWorld> o
[12:27:19] <taplar> DelphiWorld: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda $() is a constructor - it does all sorts of things on top of grabbing that reference.  but because of how js and the DOM apis work, storing that reference is actually much more efficient than looking it up over and over.
[12:29:38] <exactp> Hello you all. I am assigning a variable in smarty with a tpl I am displaying.  the tpl has a foreach loop for the records I am pulling from a database. is it possible to use ajax and reload the variable with new data without reloading the page?
[12:29:58] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, hmm so storing it in a variable and calling that var repeatedly is better than calling the element itself using a $() then ?
[12:30:00] <robertmaxrees> exactp do what now?
[12:30:16] <exactp> robertmaxrees, sorry I had trouble coming up with my question.
[12:30:24] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda much more so.  $() creates a new object every time you call it.  why recreate the same thing over and over?
[12:30:38] <taplar> exactp: what is 'smarty'?
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> exactp what is "smarty" and "tpl"?
[12:31:31] <robertmaxrees> exactp and what what variable are you talking about?
[12:31:50] <exactp> robertmaxrees, I have a varible that is assigned in smarty $this->tpl->assign('var', $var); before I use $this->tpl->display('the.tpl');
[12:32:02] <robertmaxrees> exactp wut?
[12:32:04] <exactp> the tpl itself has a foreach look which looks through the records in the database
[12:32:05] <taplar> php?
[12:32:11] <robertmaxrees> is that php or js?
[12:32:12] <exactp> smarty template
[12:32:34] <exactp> http://www.smarty.net/ :s
[12:32:45] <taplar> that's a php template engine...
[12:32:50] <exactp> Yes
[12:33:26] <taplar> so, ok
[12:33:30] <exactp> I'm trying to see if I am able to work with the variable assigned before the tpl is displayed
[12:33:34] <taplar> pushing that aside, yes
[12:33:42] <taplar> you can reload a single part of the page with ajax without a complete reload
[12:33:45] <exactp> or should I actually assign it outside of smarty and work with it
[12:34:11] <exactp> Right but it seems like it is outside of my control using smarty's tpl->assign();
[12:34:15] <taplar> right
[12:34:21] <taplar> cause your in the browser at that point
[12:34:21] <abishek> am not sure if this is the right channel to ask this question, i have a div with 4 span elements and I want to show the 4 directions using the 4 span elements, aligned top, bottom, left and right. How do I do that?
[12:34:53] <exactp> Okay so my suspicions are true, crap
[12:35:27] <taplar> abishek: try #css
[12:36:04] <exactp> taplar, it would be best to remove the variable assigned in the templating engine and do my routines through the actual front-end?
[12:36:07] <DelphiWorld> is this correct? media.currentTime =counter-15;
[12:36:37] <taplar> exactp: i have no clue.  just simply, once your in the browser, your not running php.
[12:36:50] <taplar> what you need and how you impliment the solution is up to you
[12:37:05] <Ungy> hello I am stumbling on a problem I am making an ajax call and getting a result when I console. log the result it displays an object the data is in the attribute response.JSON but whenever I attempt to get that attribute I get undefined.
[12:37:38] <Ungy> sorry i mean responseJSON
[12:38:17] <taplar> exactp: look under 'Seeking through media'
[12:38:23] <taplar> crap wrong person
[12:38:28] <taplar> DelphiWorld: ^
[12:38:47] <DelphiWorld> taplar: yep i am there
[12:38:50] <DelphiWorld> media.currentTime =counter-15;
[12:38:58] <DelphiWorld> so i am doing counter - 15
[12:39:01] <DelphiWorld> 15seconds
[12:39:20] <taplar> oh, so yeah
[12:40:02] <DelphiWorld> crap... no effect
[12:40:08] <taplar> Ungy: what exactly is in the console that is logged?
[12:40:09] <DelphiWorld> i'll use alert to check the counter
[12:40:21] <Ungy> alert will mess you up console.log
[12:40:35] <Ungy> alert masks a lot of race conditions
[12:40:47] <taplar> uh, right.  not sure how that relates to my question
[12:41:18] <robertmaxrees> iirc DelphiWorld is blind and can't see the js console with their screen reader.
[12:41:30] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees is right
[12:41:31] <Ungy> taplar so I get an object printed as I expect
[12:41:40] <robertmaxrees> Ungy show us the code.
[12:41:44] <Ungy> the object is a standard jquery ajax response
[12:41:58] <taplar> Object [] or a json string?
[12:42:11] <Deinos> hi there
[12:42:24] <Deinos> anyone ever heard of velocity.js ?
[12:42:38] <taplar> you can't hear velocity
[12:42:44] <robertmaxrees> Deinos did you have a question about it?
[12:42:45] <DelphiWorld> lol, audio production related? :P
[12:42:45] <taplar> unless your dealing with sonicboom.js
[12:42:59] <taplar> ba dum chee!
[12:43:12] <Deinos> yeah, I wanted to ask if anyone knows how I can make a perpetual animation eg a rotation that doesn't go back and forth
[12:43:28] <Deinos> as it does if you use the "loop" function in conjunction with rotate
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> show us what you have so far.
[12:44:35] <Deinos> $('.wheel').velocity({rotateZ: "360deg"}, {loop:2}); if I write something like this
[12:44:50] <Deinos> it rotates one way and then back, 2 times
[12:44:52] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fiddle, i mean.
[12:45:06] <Deinos> which is as described in the docs, but thats not really what i want ;D
[12:46:30] <Ungy> taplar http://jsbin.com/jebetunoga/edit?js
[12:47:17] <taplar> oh
[12:47:22] <taplar> your returning a deferred dude
[12:47:22] <Deinos> theres really not much to show, its just the very basic functionality of velocity
[12:47:29] <Ungy> taplar I put my code  but everythign works there it is when I try to access results.response.JSON i get undefined but if I view response it has an attribute response.JSON so I am confused
[12:47:30] <taplar> you need to put a done() on it
[12:47:38] <robertmaxrees> Ungy this.displaySearchStores(this.getSearchResults()); returns the promise of the ajax call.
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> not the data itself.
[12:47:50] <Ungy> OH sweet
[12:47:51] <Deinos> the one liner is all there is to it, combined with a div that has the class "wheel" which has an image as well
[12:47:54] <robertmaxrees> Deinos *sigh* http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/
[12:47:56] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[12:48:05] <robertmaxrees> Deinos should be able to figure it out from there.
[12:48:38] <Deinos> thanks robert :)
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> this is why fiddles are helpful duder
[12:49:46] <Deinos> yeah well i barely ever used it ^^
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> then learn.
[12:49:58] <taplar> use it, live it, luv it
[12:50:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:50:20] <Ungy> OK now I am really confused I lose the response when I append done()
[12:50:32] <taplar> you have to give it a callback function
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> Ungy you need .done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[12:50:41] <taplar> ^
[12:50:45] <Deinos> how do i include velocity.js there?
[12:50:55] <taplar> this is for Ungy
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> Deinos see the "external resources" on the left?
[12:51:01] <taplar> oh, nvm
[12:51:16] <Deinos> yeah but does it have to be an url or can i upload it? well ill check
[12:51:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't upload.
[12:51:35] <robertmaxrees> but velocity is available via CDNs
[12:54:40] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> you just wanted to loop an animation, right?
[12:55:06] <Ungy> man everytime you say velocity it makes me cringe I work everyday in Apache#velocity
[12:55:06] <robertmaxrees> Deinos there's an option for that.
[12:55:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/1/
[12:55:29] <Deinos> yeah I just tried but it didnt seem to like my cdn link :(
[12:55:33] <taplar> lol
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> what link did you use Deinos?
[12:55:44] <Deinos> ty
[12:55:45] <taplar> idk y but that's humerous
[12:56:01] <taplar> much like my spelling
[12:56:08] <Deinos> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/velocity/1.2.3/velocity.min.js
[12:56:09] <robertmaxrees> https://www.glenoaks.edu/facultystaff/FacultyWebSites/hartung/PublishingImages/Bones/humerus%20posterior%20labeled.JPG this is humerus, too
[12:56:22] <DelphiWorld> nonononono, not pocible! what's this brightness... thanks jquery people.
[12:56:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:57:09] <DelphiWorld> i am felling totaly diferent
[12:57:18] <DelphiWorld> getting started pretty faaaast
[12:57:42] <Deinos> robert, your example is exactly my problem, it goes back and forth not round and round
[12:58:04] <robertmaxrees> Deinos it's going round and round...
[12:58:09] <taplar> i guess i don't see the 'back'
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> are you complaining about the easing?
[12:58:20] <robertmaxrees> the speed up/slow down effect?
[12:58:28] <Deinos> im saying the rotation goes back and forth not on and on
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> Deinos no it doesn't.
[12:58:38] <Deinos> try using 60deg instead of 360, then youll see
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> it goes forward.
[12:58:48] <Deinos> forward, then back, then forward
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:59:00] <Ungy> from inside a done function how do i return the data?
[12:59:00] <robertmaxrees> so you'd like it to rotate slower?
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> Ungy you don't.
[12:59:14] <Deinos> no, id like ongoing forward motion
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> Ungy anything that relies on that data needs to be in the .done() callback.
[12:59:25] <robertmaxrees> Deinos you have that in the fiddle i gave you.
[12:59:27] <Deinos> the 60deg is just so you see that its not ongoing forward
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/1/ is always going forward.
[12:59:56] <robertmaxrees> changing parameters will of course make it behave differently.
[13:00:35] <Deinos> $div.velocity({   rotateZ: "360deg" },{   loop: true }); <-- this just turns it back and forth, which is as it should, cause thats how its also described in the docs
[13:00:46] <Deinos> ah and the other one, yeah ill try that
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing it go backwards.
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> only forwards.
[13:00:59] <Deinos> but last time i did something like that my chrome froze
[13:01:05] <Deinos> thats why i said
[13:01:06] <Ungy> robertmaxrees, I have to have a return and I cannot put it int he done object so any ideas how I can just get the string returned
[13:01:06] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/3dy4o7v3/2/
[13:01:12] <Deinos> put 60 instead of 360
[13:01:13] <taplar> little slower
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> Ungy you can't.
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> Deinos then it will behave differently.
[13:01:28] <Deinos> nop
[13:01:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/3/
[13:01:37] <Deinos> cause i tried that already with actual pictures
[13:01:41] <robertmaxrees> so this goes back and forth?
[13:01:45] <Deinos> where i can see that the 360 go back and forth
[13:01:47] <robertmaxrees> because that's only going one direction for me.
[13:01:57] <Deinos> then try a longer duration...
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/4/ slowed down even further.
[13:02:00] <Ungy> robertmaxrees, can I not push the data out eslewhere into the global scope or something?
[13:02:04] <robertmaxrees> Ungy nope.
[13:02:09] <Ungy> why?
[13:02:15] <taplar> Ungy: you want to send the data to a function that will process it
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> Ungy because you can't guarantee when the ajax call with finish.
[13:02:24] <robertmaxrees> ajax is asynchronous.
[13:02:36] <robertmaxrees> so you never know when it will be done - this is why you have a .done() callback.,
[13:02:40] <Ungy> I understand that
[13:02:49] <Deinos> hmm
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> so anything that relies on that data needs to use the promise.
[13:02:53] <Ungy> but I can make a call to the function that uses the data in the done function
[13:03:05] <Ungy> but I can't pass the data into that function?
[13:03:10] <Ungy> that is retyarded
[13:03:11] <robertmaxrees> Ungy sure you can.
[13:03:13] <Deinos> ok I take everything back and proclaim the opposit:D
[13:03:15] <taplar> yes you can, from within the done
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> and not an okay word.
[13:03:17] <Ungy> well then I am retarded
[13:03:23] <robertmaxrees> still not an okay word.
[13:03:32] <Deinos> what confused me was that loop :2 behaves differently than loop : true
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> Ungy .done(function(mydata) { someOtherFunction(myData.someProperty) });
[13:03:53] <Deinos> but its still not smooth :/
[13:04:08] <Deinos> is there a  way to do the rounds without stop?
[13:04:10] <robertmaxrees> Deinos it's totally smooth - you just need to refactor to make use of async.
[13:04:17] <robertmaxrees> Deinos sure, remove the easing.
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> the docs describe all of this.
[13:04:46] <Ungy> robertmaxrees, retarded: delay or hold back in terms of progress, development, or accomplishment since I obvoisly am unable to grasp it it fits perfectly
[13:05:05] <robertmaxrees> Ungy contextually that word is derogatory, so that makes it not okay.
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd appreciate if you wouldn't use it again - thanks!
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to discuss more, feel free to PM me :)
[13:05:33] <robertmaxrees> Deinos http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/5/
[13:05:35] <robertmaxrees> linear easing.
[13:06:06] <Ungy> when in the done function what is my scope?
[13:06:18] <DelphiWorld> taplar: currentTime work perfectly,thanks
[13:06:19] <robertmaxrees> Ungy the calling function usually.
[13:06:29] <taplar> DelphiWorld: cool
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> Deinos http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/6/
[13:07:01] * taplar doesn't remember suggesting currentTime but....... takes the win!
[13:08:47] <Deinos> thanks robert! do you know how I can turn it in the opposit direction? if I simply add "-" it starts going back and forth again
[13:10:16] <Ungy> robertmaxrees, Ihad to go to globalscope for reference but it is now working thank you.
[13:10:25] <robertmaxrees> Ungy wut
[13:10:30] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't have global anything.
[13:10:47] <Ungy> snap.ui.storemanager.displaySearchStores(data);
[13:10:56] <Ungy> I only have snap in the global scope
[13:10:59] <robertmaxrees> no idea what snap is, but ok.
[13:11:17] <Ungy> it is my extensible framework
[13:11:26] <Ungy> very rudamentory but it works
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> Deinos search around - should be easy to figure out.
[13:14:04] <Deinos> well on the velocity website is nothing on "opposit" or "negative" and "reverse" means something else
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> right, so look for css transition information.
[13:14:41] <robertmaxrees> it's all out there.
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> great creative and play around :)
[13:15:17] <taplar> the interwebz?
[13:19:01] <veverak> hmm
[13:19:25] <veverak> want to replace to modify on some links... (which should be easy)
[13:19:33] <veverak> but I am not able to figure out what is going wrong here
[13:19:36] <veverak> https://bpaste.net/show/c7d63844dcfb
[13:19:53] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to take users somewhere else?
[13:20:10] <veverak> yes aaaaand no
[13:20:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do?
[13:20:22] <veverak> same page, different arguments in GET?
[13:20:25] <veverak> :)
[13:20:29] <robertmaxrees> so then yes.
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to take the user to a different url than what they clicked on.
[13:21:14] <veverak> yeah
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> then just use window.location.href
[13:21:47] <robertmaxrees> set that to the value you want and it'll take them there,.
[13:22:04] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/38d73a510039
[13:23:37] <veverak> that's not the main problem here
[13:23:45] <veverak> main problem is that I tried to put breakpoint there in chrome
[13:23:52] <veverak> and that is not triggered when I click on it :/
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:24:01] <veverak> ((even when I added e.preventDefault())
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> what's happening instead?
[13:24:13] <robertmaxrees> you're being kind of vague :)
[13:24:16] <veverak> it goes to page
[13:24:20] <veverak> where it should go
[13:24:24] <veverak> (and no change in url)
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> so it's not updating the URL in the way you expect it to?
[13:24:52] <veverak> https://bpaste.net/show/d2da295160f1
[13:24:56] <veverak> that was link I wanted to use!
[13:24:58] <veverak> :D
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[13:25:12] <veverak> k
[13:25:24] <veverak> robertmaxrees: point is that I tried to debug it with browser
[13:25:34] <veverak> by adding breakpoint in chromes debug tools
[13:25:45] <veverak> on the line where it loads the value from different element
[13:25:52] <veverak> and I never reached that breakpoint
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> do you dynamically add those links?
[13:26:02] <veverak> so I suspect that "click" event is not binded properly, not sure why :/
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready?
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:26:07] <Deinos> can you tell me any website with a list of all values/properties for transitions? when I checked I didn't really get much
[13:26:11] <martixy> G'evening gentlemen. How do I fix this: https://jsfiddle.net/martixy/qe4mzx9t/
[13:26:14] <realies> does someone know a vertical slider plugin like this one? https://i.imgur.com/w4K5ViI.jpg
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> Deinos MDN has that kind of information.
[13:26:31] <veverak> robertmaxrees: didn't!
[13:26:44] <realies> horizontal*
[13:26:53] <robertmaxrees> martixy you're assuming we know what you want to have happen ;)
[13:27:36] <martixy> Er... well, one to sweep over the other, not create the second one, do the transition and then hide the first one
[13:28:43] <veverak> hmm
[13:28:48] <veverak> robertmaxrees: put that in document ready
[13:28:53] <veverak> and wrote alert() at the end of it
[13:28:54] <robertmaxrees> then position one div over the other instead and just hide is, martixy
[13:28:57] <veverak> that alert didn't show
[13:29:01] <veverak> I suspect syntax error
[13:29:02] <robertmaxrees> veverak any console erors?
[13:30:16] <veverak> ah, console! :)
[13:31:05] <Ungy> unless your working with an old browser don't debug with alert it causes other problems.
[13:31:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't think he was suggesting he was using alert.
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:33:18] <realies> martixy: What about the next/prev one being faded out on the sides?
[13:33:45] <veverak> wow
[13:33:47] <Ungy> using $().on() to bind an event shoudl catch dynamically added content as well correct?
[13:33:47] <veverak> ok
[13:33:51] <Deinos_> lol
[13:33:52] <veverak> that app was not using $
[13:33:54] <robertmaxrees> Ungy nope.
[13:33:55] <veverak> but jQuery only
[13:33:57] <veverak> daaamn
[13:33:59] <gju> hey, i'm a little stuck here. i have the following code: http://pastie.org/private/hfjpsqfjdwvf6grmywmxvq and it gives me "Uncaught TypeError: b.replace is not a function" from the jquery.js file. i don't really know what i'm doing wrong.
[13:34:05] <robertmaxrees> Ungy takes more than that.
[13:34:07] <Deinos_> I didn't find anything on negative motion
[13:34:15] <gju> can anybody help?
[13:34:18] <Deinos_> so I simply put the minus in front of the duration
[13:34:19] <veverak> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[13:34:24] <Deinos_> and it works -_-
[13:34:37] <robertmaxrees> veverak sure!
[13:34:57] <robertmaxrees> gju make a fiddle?
[13:34:58] <Deinos_> or did you mean for me to find something else?
[13:34:59] <martixy> realies: Well... since the structure of the page is vertical, it wouldn't work.
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> Deinos i just meant for you to try.
[13:35:21] <Deinos_> im always tryin
[13:35:25] <Ungy> grrr and live is deprecated
[13:35:36] <robertmaxrees> Ungy right, there's a delegated syntax for .on()
[13:35:45] <martixy> There's the one segment where it needs to happen like that, and the other ones below are hidden by default and show in successive steps.
[13:35:45] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:36:59] <realies> martixy: I was thinking of overflows and calculating parent width which would recalculate the offset, but cant really do it myself :/
[13:37:48] <robertmaxrees> so then learn :)
[13:37:48] <Ungy> ahh fishsticks
[13:37:57] <martixy> I see... I'll think of something eventually, maybe... but my pizza just came so... :D
[13:37:59] <Deinos_> but its still not smooth, at least not as smooth as css animation, which is a bit disappointing cause I thought velocity is above that, or am I getting something wrong
[13:38:19] <Deinos_> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/5/
[13:38:19] <robertmaxrees> Deinos_ smoothness relies on a lot of different factors.
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> open your profiler and start looking at why.,
[13:39:19] <Deinos_> well, what factors can I influence? all articles I read said js > css animation by like many times buuut ...:(
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> the way you're laying things out, the kind of css you're using, etc.
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> like, lots of things at play.
[13:41:28] <gju> robertmaxrees: sure, https://jsfiddle.net/gju_/8bq88aww/
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to remove whicheer row was checked?
[13:42:28] <gju> aye
[13:43:12] <robertmaxrees> so a coupla things.
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> first off, you can just .closest('tr').remove();
[13:43:28] <Deinos_> well you see the fiddle its very rudimentary
[13:43:29] <Deinos_> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3dy4o7v3/5/
[13:43:38] <robertmaxrees> Deinos_ i sent that out earlier.
[13:43:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit update and then share the new url.
[13:43:46] <Deinos_> yeah and i changed it
[13:43:50] <Deinos_> ah
[13:44:10] <Deinos_> http://jsfiddle.net/3dy4o7v3/7/embedded/result/
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> gju https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8bq88aww/1/
[13:44:45] <gju> well yeah, but i need to know the ids so i can sync my backend.
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> gju your origina issue was $("#test-table").remove($(row)); - $(row) was translating to roughly $('0');
[13:44:53] <gju> so the iteration isn't optional
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> then .map() those into an array and handle that separately.
[13:45:35] <Deinos_> http://jsfiddle.net/3dy4o7v3/7
[13:45:55] <gju> okay, i'll try that. why is $(row) like $('0')?
[13:46:31] <robertmaxrees> because var pk = $(row).attr("data-pk"); - pk is going to be string 0 or string 1 in your example.
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> also, you want .data() when getting/setting data attributes.
[13:47:22] <gju> oh ok. i'm still pretty new to all this stuff. thanks a alot!
[13:47:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:47:51] <gju> so. one question still. why does the above call change what tr is?
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:48:23] <gju> if i understood you correctly the call makes $(tr) equal to $("0"), right?
[13:48:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:48:56] <Ungy> thank you everyone for all your help. Have a good mornign/day/evening/night.
[13:49:14] <robertmaxrees> gju https://jsfiddle.net/8bq88aww/ back to your fiddle - that .each() call you're doing var pk = $(row).attr("data-pk"); first thing, right?
[13:49:21] <realies> martixy: I envy you, I'm on the train to home, hungry as fk
[13:49:33] <realies> and the coolest thing is I got no proper food at home
[13:49:50] <gju> robertmaxrees: yup
[13:49:54] <robertmaxrees> what means pk is '0' - then you pass that to $(), so you're trying to select $('0');
[13:50:03] <martixy> :) Yea. I just decided not to bother today and ordered.
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> which isn't anything.
[13:50:37] <gju> but it's $(row) not $(pk)
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> var pk = $(row).attr("data-pk"); is fine - pk is then set to '0'
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> $("#test-table").remove($(row)); is where your problem was.
[13:51:17] <gju> yes, that
[13:51:21] <robertmaxrees> you were literally doing $("#test-table").remove($('0'));
[13:51:23] <gju> s what confuses me
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> oooh woops.
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> i see what you mean.
[13:51:43] <gju> i dont get it
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> i was reading that wrong.
[13:51:53] <robertmaxrees> row is fine - that's my bad hahaha
[13:52:08] <gju> phew... i was thinking i'm a little off... :)
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> i was misreading that line entirely - i apologize.  you're fine there.  $("#test-table").remove($(row)); doesn't work because .remove() takes an optional selector.
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> which filters the collection you're on.  instead you passed it a jquery object, which doesn't work.
[13:53:02] <robertmaxrees> and also, there are no #test-table elements that are one of your rows.
[13:53:13] <gju> ok that makes sense. i should read the docs some time
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> all the time :)
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/remove/ explains at the very top.
[13:53:38] <gju> may this be a lesson to me.
[13:53:45] <Deinos_> hmm so I guess I'll have to use V8 Engine from Google to make the javascript execution faster.. don't see any other thing I could do to increase animation smoothness
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> Deinos_ uh...
[13:54:10] <robertmaxrees> that's only in chrome, you can't just use that with any browser.
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> profile your stuff, see what's up.
[13:54:34] <Deinos_> what do you mean by profiling it?
[13:54:52] <robertmaxrees> your browser has built-in profiling tools.  chrome's are especially nice in cases like this.
[13:55:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jankfree.org/ has all sorts of resources for you.
[13:58:15] <Deinos__> jeeez
[13:58:25] <Deinos__> this webirc is crashing down constantly XD
[13:58:34] <Deinos__> if you said anything mind repeating?^^
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jankfree.org/ has all sorts of resources for you.
[13:58:42] <robertmaxrees> use that.
[14:13:03] <someQuestions> I'm having an issue trying to merge conversions to a total number. Any thoughts on how I can do it? http://jsfiddle.net/2ttxff4w/1/
[14:15:30] <taplar> someQuestions: forEach() doesn't pass in an index.  it passes in the actual object
[14:16:50] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2FforEach
[14:16:50] <someQuestions> Yea, I tried to push into an array so I can call it outside of the forEach, but I kept receiving 0;
[14:17:16] <robertmaxrees> also, goalNames is an object - you can't push into an object.
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to end up with?
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm you're pushing into an array that's in a prop of goalNames
[14:18:08] <someQuestions> and taplar, I now know what you meant on the index
[14:18:38] <robertmaxrees> though why not just use .map() and get an array of tds you want.
[14:18:43] <taplar> i may have miss read some things.  re-reading your logic
[14:23:16] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/2ttxff4w/2/
[14:23:19] <taplar> so what's wrong?
[14:23:40] <DelphiWorld> thanks to whoever helped me!
[14:25:09] <odigem> Hi
[14:25:45] <odigem> how to disable enter value to input in  Autocomplete ?
[14:25:55] <odigem> wrong
[14:26:01] <odigem> need disable select value
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> then set disabled on it.
[14:26:23] <odigem> i want look values
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:27:30] <someQuestions> taplar: I just want to be able to merge all the conversion totals into one total number outside of the forEach
[14:27:34] <odigem> i want display autocomplite variant but disallow choice it
[14:27:41] <someQuestions> however, I keep receiving 0
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> odigem then disable it.
[14:28:00] <taplar> i don't see any 'merge' logic in that fiddle
[14:28:01] <robertmaxrees> odigem make a fiddle if you're still confused.
[14:28:20] <taplar> other than the first grouping bit
[14:31:21] <buu> So, has anyone seen the bug with scrollTop while you have an opened select dropdown (on chrome?) moving the displayed box of selections?
[14:33:12] <odigem> jsfiddle new design is shit
[14:33:19] <odigem> not work
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> i like it.
[14:33:23] <robertmaxrees> and it totally works.
[14:33:33] <phelix> I am using ui.slider it works perfectly fine in desktop. However in mobile it seems that it doesn't even initialize as its not adding the correct classes etc as how it does on desktop version. Anyone have any ideas what could be causing this?
[14:34:08] <exxy-> odigem: they moved the jquery cdns to the little cog wheel in the js window -- thought I'd mention it before you went on a tirade I did
[14:34:41] <buu> Basically I open a regular ol <select> box then call an animated scrolltop and it scrolls the window while keeping the box displayed by the select in a fixed position rather than relative to the scroll
[14:34:54] <robertmaxrees> buu can you make a fiddle to demonstrate?
[14:35:01] <taplar> i've seen that before
[14:35:10] <buu> robertmaxrees: quite possibly
[14:35:18] <taplar> it's because of the position: fixed
[14:35:28] <buu> what has position fixed?
[14:35:42] <taplar> you said you have your select fixed?
[14:35:55] <odigem> robertmaxrees: can look why it shit not work? https://jsfiddle.net/3dvsrc33/
[14:35:57] <buu> Sorry, it *acts* as if it was fixed
[14:36:09] <taplar> meaning your page scrolls and your select stays in place?
[14:36:19] <robertmaxrees> odyniec uh.
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> err, odigem why are oyu loading things like that?
[14:36:41] <odigem> robertmaxrees: i dnt know how to any
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> odigem you're loading jquery from an http domain onto https - that's why it's broken.
[14:36:59] <robertmaxrees> click the cog icon next to the javascript heading in that box and select from there instead.
[14:38:49] <odigem> robertmaxrees: thanks man, i think i never find it
[14:39:01] <robertmaxrees> somebody else already told you to do that.
[14:39:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:39:53] <odigem> robertmaxrees: look i set disabled:true
[14:40:03] <odigem> now autocomplite not work
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> odigem so you want to be able to set the value but not let the user set it?
[14:40:19] <robertmaxrees> why are you displaying it then:/
[14:40:43] <taplar> can't complete if you can't start
[14:40:52] <taplar> auto or not
[14:40:55] <odigem> someone want see existing values here. before add it
[14:41:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:41:08] <odigem> :D
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> so then you don't want autocomplete?
[14:41:14] <robertmaxrees> like... wut
[14:41:35] <taplar> lets follow that logic
[14:41:41] <taplar> i see existing values
[14:41:41] <odigem> xD
[14:41:42] <buu> robertmaxrees: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/v26oxvs3/
[14:41:47] <taplar> i decide, yes, i want a new one
[14:41:48] <buu> Click on the select box in the output
[14:41:50] <taplar> but it's disabled...
[14:42:20] <robertmaxrees> buu i was just suggesting you make a fiddle - i'm actually about to disappear for a while.
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> good luck y'all!
[14:42:27] <buu> !
[14:42:31] <buu> I'm reporting you
[14:42:34] <buu> To the jquery authorities
[14:54:41] <phelix> Anyone have any idea what would cause my range slider to initialize just fine in desktop view but in mobile when I view it. Its not adding any of the classes etc as it does in desktop
[14:56:49] <exxy-> are there media queries on those classes?  or.. are you using "hidden-phone" or "xs" or something from Bootstrap on the elements?
[14:58:12] <exxy-> phelix: do you use chrome?
[14:58:43] <MikeD_> window.open() returns a handle to the opened window... can I read the top/left/width/height and trap the resize event on that window?
[14:58:46] <momomo> what is the best way to move an element to the last position ? $elem.parent().append($elem) seems to work, is that the "best" way ?
[15:00:10] <exxy-> phelix: use the f12 dev tools, toggle device mode (https://i.imgur.com/qObd62T.png), and watch the classes on the element change when you make the window smaller
[15:01:57] <phelix> Well the site is not fully responsive. It only displays mobile when you refresh the page and are on a mobile device.
[15:03:21] <exxy-> Oh, so different code entirely?
[15:03:36] <exxy-> Should be easy to detect I imagine
[15:04:00] <phelix> no its the same. Just loads the mobile view instead of desktop view. But all the same files are included.
[15:04:13] <phelix> same html and js files
[15:04:36] <exxy-> and you're using jquery.ui, right?
[15:04:40] <phelix> ya
[15:04:51] <exxy-> wondering if responsiveness is built into that or something
[15:04:58] <exxy-> since it's the only thing affected
[15:05:05] <phelix> its like it doesn't even initialize. Its not adding the same classes to the slider as it does on desktop
[15:05:38] <phelix> Well doesn't seem to be a css issue as its not modifying the element like it does with desktop view
[15:10:14] <noahmg123> is there an easy way to use a grab the value selected when an option in a select is changed?
[15:10:38] <taplar> on change this.value
[15:10:49] <noahmg123> taplar: thank you.
[15:17:49] <dancrodev> hey everyone, how is everyone today
[15:18:34] <dancrodev> I'm not very jQuery intelligent, wondering if anyone had like 3-5 minutes of time to talk through a problem I'm having.
[15:18:43] <taplar> go for it
[15:18:43] <robertBusy> just put it out to the channel.
[15:18:48] <robertBusy> if anybody can help, they will.
[15:18:48] <dancrodev> alright thanks
[15:19:12] <dancrodev> I have a  multi-pane form, each pane being an individual form, that I consolidate at the end (I know it's probably not the correct way, but just ned to steam along)
[15:19:48] <dancrodev> At the top of every form, i have <form action="javascript:myFunction()" with myFunction changing from pane to pane, validDriver  validVehicle for instance
[15:20:01] <dancrodev> window.validDriver = function validDriver()         {             console.log('inside function');             //addDriver(this);         }
[15:20:04] <robertBusy> hey so don't do that.
[15:20:09] <robertBusy> use jquery's event bindings.
[15:20:17] <robertBusy> also - make a jsfiddle instead of trying to describe what you're doing.
[15:20:37] <dancrodev> If i use jQuery binding, I can't find a way to either using HTML5 validation without it looping endlessly sometimes
[15:21:02] <robertBusy> that's an easy thing to fix.
[15:21:47] <dancrodev> You have any links to documentation on how to prevent that loop?
[15:21:57] <robertBusy> do it the right way?
[15:22:25] <robertBusy> there's no real documentation on that specifically because it's kind of a basic thing.  i'm guessing you're calling the validate and then calling some kind of submit, right?
[15:22:33] <dancrodev> A way to submit a form, have it use HTML5 validation, without looping on itself. Before I was using a little function like !valid  then form.submit() if not do this
[15:22:39] <dancrodev> and the form.submit() would loop endlessly
[15:22:48] <robertBusy> right, because you're calling submit endlessly.
[15:23:04] <robertBusy> you can pass extra data via .trigger() and nab that with .on() to prevent that.
[15:23:08] <dancrodev> correct, I'm a web dev (mostly backend) but very low-level on JS.
[15:23:21] <robertBusy> i don't have an example to share, but that's the basic idea.
[15:23:40] <dancrodev> alright, im gonna look at the docs on trigger
[15:23:45] <dancrodev> thanks for the starting point, really appreciate it
[15:23:45] <robertBusy> and .on()
[15:23:47] <robertBusy> those should help.
[15:24:01] <robertBusy> and use .on() for your event binding - inline bindings are wony.
[15:24:03] <robertBusy> *wonky
[15:24:18] <dancrodev> if there a way to allow for HTML5 validation errors on("click) outside of the basic way I described doing it before
[15:24:32] <dancrodev> or does that roll back to trigger/on combination
[15:24:43] <robertBusy> huh?
[15:24:59] <dancrodev> The way i was doing it before with a onclick handler followe by a validation test and a .submit() that looped
[15:25:08] <robertBusy> yeah, you can do that.
[15:25:25] <dancrodev> is there anyway to use the onclick event but allowing it to do the HTML5 validation without having to resubmit the form?
[15:25:42] <dancrodev> sorry if I'm confusing
[15:25:47] <dancrodev> again, JS is def. not my strong suit
[15:25:57] <robertBusy> that's fine.  great time to learn :)
[15:26:19] <dancrodev> This form will eventually be AngularJS per the requirements, but just getting something that ups right now, then diving into more JS/Angular knowledge
[15:26:25] <robertBusy> errr.
[15:26:31] <robertBusy> then use angular for it.
[15:26:47] <dancrodev> I'm more confused with Angular, and don't have the luxury of time to get something that works up,
[15:26:55] <dancrodev> I know 10x more jQuery then angular
[15:27:04] <dancrodev> but I only know like 0.0000001% of angular so you do the math lol
[15:27:35] <robertBusy> it doesn't make sense to do this all ahead of time and then try to port it over to angular.
[15:27:52] <dancrodev> the funciton i use on the first form works perfectly, but i think thats beause i load it at runtime with the function, other forms, don't work
[15:27:59] <dancrodev> Robert, it's all time based.
[15:28:05] <robertBusy> though i'd just run away from angular in general, just weird to say "i don't have time" and then spend time learning another way to do it.
[15:28:10] <robertBusy> just to spend more time down the road to change that.
[15:28:28] <robertBusy> and yeah, dynamiocally loaded things don't get event bindings automagically - use a delegated listener instead.
[15:29:30] <dancrodev> alright thanks for the info robert, you've been quite helpful
[15:29:34] <robertBusy> definitely.
[15:29:46] <dancrodev> jQuery seems to have a great community, not of other languages are as friendly lol
[15:29:49] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reportValidity
[15:29:55] <robertBusy> jquery isn't a language fwiw.
[15:30:19] <dancrodev> javascript is a langauge I get it, but that asn't really my key point lol
[15:30:40] <robertBusy> still a really important distinction.  makes jquery a lot easier to understand.
[15:30:41] <dancrodev> thanks taplar
[15:30:45] <taplar> not heavily supported though
[15:30:47] <taplar> yet
[15:31:29] <dancrodev> damn, yea it's gotta work at least the most recent updated popular browsers    chrome/firefox/IE(gross)/Safari
[15:31:54] <robertBusy> 2 things: how far back for IE?  and IE isn't gross.  especially 11/edge
[15:32:17] <dancrodev> I've used Edge, actually it wasn't that bad, especially in comparison
[15:32:41] <robertBusy> super fast JS engine, most compliant and complete es2015 implementation yet.
[15:32:44] <robertBusy> 11 is a fantastic browser, too.
[15:32:46] <dancrodev> but if some kid beats your ass in middle school everyday, when you both get older you still are going to think he's a jackass lol
[15:32:58] <robertBusy> can't think that way in web development.
[15:33:05] <dancrodev> it's just a joke ;)
[15:33:07] <robertBusy> things are changing all the time - can't automatically dismiss a browser.
[15:33:19] <dancrodev> That I use mac mostly these days outside of a Windows 10 VM
[15:33:20] <robertBusy> especially when chrome is pretty bad but gets all the love.
[15:33:33] <dancrodev> Chrome is a memory hog
[15:33:40] <robertBusy> and is noncompliant.
[15:33:45] <robertBusy> breaks a lot of rules.
[15:33:52] <robertBusy> lots of fixes in jquery core for blink/webkit
[15:34:19] <dancrodev> I'm using a lot of low level logic in my jQuery, so I probably am not touching the surface of some of the newer shinier stuff
[15:35:04] <robertBusy> errr.
[15:35:19] <dancrodev> oh btw, the way i used to it, was with .checkValidity, along with the .submit() which would loop
[15:35:23] <robertBusy> jquery isn't a language, and even if you meant "a lot of basic jquery methods", you're safe because it fills in those gaps.
[15:37:39] <martixy> https://jsfiddle.net/martixy/qe4mzx9t/1/ - How can I make the second element sweep in from the top?
[15:38:49] <robertBusy> martixy just animate one of the two.
[15:38:53] <robertBusy> then you'll get what you want.
[15:51:20] <martixy> Not sure what you might mean exactly though. :)
[15:51:35] <robertBusy> you have two divs, right?
[15:51:49] <martixy> yea
[15:52:04] <robertBusy> so place one behind the other.
[15:52:08] <robertBusy> then animate the top one.
[15:52:24] <martixy> with an absolute position or what?
[15:52:34] <robertBusy> lots of tutorials out there on how to do that.
[15:52:40] <robertBusy> #css could help, too.
[15:53:01] <realies> martixy: any thoughts on that crappy slider? : D
[15:53:12] <martixy> What slider?
[15:53:28] <realies> the horizontal one with images on the left and right
[15:53:39] <martixy> For my purposes?
[15:53:40] <realies> just before the pizza man
[15:53:41] <realies> : D
[15:53:49] <martixy> :)
[15:54:58] <martixy> Not even interactive
[15:54:58] <realies> nevermind dude
[16:11:11] <jak2000> hi all
[16:11:31] <jak2000> how to copy the content of a HTML table to a input text i try this: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/W4Km8/7378/
[16:11:54] <robertBusy> fix that js error first.
[16:12:47] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/W4Km8/7379/   ?
[16:13:08] <robertBusy> and now it works.
[16:13:39] <taplar> you don't have to append it to a div
[16:13:44] <taplar> you can do prop('outerHTML')
[16:13:48] <robertBusy> that too.
[16:13:57] <robertBusy> though sending all that markup over is... gross.
[16:14:08] <robertBusy> parse it into json and go crazy.
[16:15:11] <taplar> why...... do you have a blank class attribute on everything?
[16:16:37] <arc_> looks like it was generated with something
[16:16:44] <taplar> hope so
[16:16:52] <taplar> it makes me sad
[16:16:53] <taplar> lol
[16:26:14] <jak2000> robertBusy: $("#datosExportar").val($("$<div>").append($("#myTabla").eq(0).clone()).html());  whe try this code on my production project say me these error: "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: $<div>"  whyyyy?
[16:26:44] <robertBusy> out of the 600+ people here, you need me?
[16:26:45] <robertBusy> D:
[16:26:54] <arc_> his name says busy
[16:27:02] <robertBusy> and what does $("$<div>") mean?
[16:27:09] <arc_> i've never seen $<div>
[16:27:10] <robertBusy> if you want a dollar sign, you need to escape that
[16:27:18] <robertBusy> otherwise, delete it. thx.
[16:27:42] <jak2000> thx
[16:47:00] <jquery287> Hey, I need some help.
[16:47:25] <robertBusy> just ask your question :)
[16:48:34] <jquery287> I have something coded out in jquery, it's suppose to be where one div fades in, the one fades out, then one div fades in. Ect. I have them set to delay, but they keep coming in one after another.
[16:48:48] <robertBusy> make a jsfiddle.
[16:48:49] <robertBusy> show us.
[16:49:26] <dancrodev> thanks to robert and taplar again, finally got it to work. combo of onClick, .checkValidity and this line $('<input type="submit">').hide().appendTo($myForm).click().remove();  (because it wouldn't reconize or click the submit button I hard coded in the dynamic form)
[16:49:29] <dancrodev> So thank you guys very much.
[16:49:49] <robertBusy> dancrodev err...
[16:50:06] <dancrodev> it's not beauitful, but it works.
[16:50:07] <robertBusy> dancrodev might want to make sure it works the way you expect when you press the enter key on your keyboard :)
[16:51:14] <dancrodev> robert, is there a more encompassing way to trigger the button other then onClick,   like onTrigger or something like that?
[16:51:26] <dancrodev> or should I wrap the logic in a function and have a method for onClick and onKeyDown
[16:51:31] <robertBusy> technically you don't care about clicks, you care about submit.
[16:51:40] <dancrodev> ohh onSubmit
[16:51:46] <dancrodev> let me look into that, thanks again
[16:51:47] <jquery287> It doesn't seem to be working on jsfiddle, but here http://jsfiddle.net/co2ecdgb/ that's all the code. It's for a profile, so if you need to see how it works, I can post the link.
[16:51:51] <robertBusy> .on('submit', function() {});
[16:51:55] <jquery287> Pretty much you press no, and it's suppose to work.
[16:52:07] <jquery287> And it does, but after the first line, they all come too fast.
[16:52:15] <robertBusy> jquery287 you didn't include jquery in there.
[16:52:40] <robertBusy> and your issue is that these are all async methods.
[16:52:45] <robertBusy> so they all fire at the same time.
[16:52:53] <robertBusy> need to chain the callbacks.
[16:53:09] <jquery287> It's for a profile. When I edit it, Js/Jquery is already connected to it.
[16:53:20] <jquery287> And what do you mean?
[16:53:21] <robertBusy> with jsfiddle, you need to include jquery manually.
[16:53:28] <jquery287> Oh
[16:53:30] <robertBusy> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/co2ecdgb/1/
[16:53:47] <robertBusy> and i mean that all of those fadein/fadeoout calls happen at once - they're async operations.
[16:54:05] <robertBusy> so the code doesn't wait for one to finish before firing the next.
[16:54:14] <robertBusy> check out https://api.jquery.com/queue/ to get what you want.
[16:56:04] <jquery287> Gah so confuse
[16:56:16] <robertBusy> okay lets back up.
[16:56:43] <robertBusy> most jquery methods are blocking, right? as in, the code runs and everything waits until its done before moving to the next line.
[16:56:44] <robertBusy> make sense?
[16:56:55] <jquery287> Yes
[16:57:21] <robertBusy> okay - animate methods, just like ajax (and some others) aren't like that.  they issue their command to the browser and then release back to the program's flow.
[16:57:33] <robertBusy> so things don't wait for that code to finish running.
[16:57:44] <robertBusy> because doing so would cause the browser to lock up.
[16:58:52] <jquery287> Ok
[16:59:24] <robertBusy> so instead you need to create a queue of animations to run - that way they'll run in the order you want, and wait like you need them to.,
[17:01:04] <robertBusy> make sense?
[17:01:37] <dancrodev> robert, thanks for bringing up the 'enter' issue.
[17:01:59] <robertBusy> dancrodev this was why i was suggesting the on/trigger stuff earlier.
[17:02:11] <dancrodev> Yea I understand
[17:02:27] <jquery287> Yes, a bit.
[17:02:40] <robertBusy> jquery what about it isn't clicking?
[17:04:17] <jquery287> I get what you're saying, it's just that I know only a little js/jquery. So while I get what most of what you're saying, actually doing it is confusing me.
[17:04:29] <robertBusy> so how can we help?
[17:06:41] <jquery287> How exactly would I go about hooking up the .queue? Would I need to recode it?
[17:06:49] <robertBusy> basically.
[17:07:41] <robertBusy> though because you're acting on different elements, you may need to use deferreds here.
[17:08:46] <robertBusy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4198091/chaining-jquery-animations-that-affect-different-elements this has some good info, too.

[21:29:04] <hexdj> how can I target a <label> that has a "for" attribute that I know
[21:29:36] <hexdj> $("label [for]:"+knownValueHere) or something like that?
[21:35:22] <arc_> hexdj $("label[for='yourvalue']")
[21:35:35] <hexdj> thanks arc, got it :)
[21:36:13] <arc_> apparently there has been a jsfiddle update
[21:36:17] <arc_> it took me a while to figure out how to load jquery
