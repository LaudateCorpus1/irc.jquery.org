[08:14:45] <paule32> hello
[08:14:59] <undefined_bob> hola
[08:15:09] <paule32> i have a problem with ajax $.ajax:
[08:15:37] <paule32> when the script that must be loaded is in the same folder as the .js file, then all done
[08:16:02] <paule32> but, when i try different directory, the execution stops
[08:16:13] <paule32> i get no error
[08:16:26] <paule32> so, something is wrong?
[08:20:10] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/0QRSDB4
[08:20:18] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/342K3GC
[08:20:28] <paule32> the last one will not work
[08:22:16] <Cork> paule32: bind an always handler
[08:22:31] <Cork> else you basically say if it goes bade you don't care
[08:22:59] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function() {}).always(function() {})
[08:22:59] <paule32> how can i bind?'
[08:23:00] <undefined_bob> I can only guess but did you try to write the path to the script the same way you would do it on a server? For example ../foo1/foo2/app1.php
[08:23:13] <Cork> paule32: success: is the old format for .done()
[08:23:25] <Cork> don't ever nerember what .always used to be
[08:23:35] <Cork> undefined_bob: it is an absolute path
[08:23:39] <Cork> so ../ doesn't help
[08:23:51] <Cork> and would trigger the 404 handler
[08:24:01] <paule32> undefined_bob: i try rel, and absolute path
[08:24:07] <paule32> all fails
[08:24:26] <Cork> paule32: you might be getting a 5xx or similar response
[08:24:33] <paule32> so, http://mydomain.tld/foo .. don't work
[08:24:49] <Cork> but so you want to catch all errors
[08:24:57] <Cork> includeing ajax errors (parsing errors)
[08:25:41] <paule32> the problem is, that the script(s) will loaded, and work, if they in the same directory as the caller
[08:26:11] <Cork> paule32: you need to make sure you grab all the error data you can
[08:26:18] <Cork> before that you drive with a blindfold
[08:26:28] <Cork> after you have doen then you can try again
[08:27:38] <Cork> the argument format of always is complete:
[08:28:31] <Cork> you could also try addin a .fail() or error:
[08:28:47] <Cork> to catch all errors instead of all requests answers
[08:29:46] <Cork> but note https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[08:29:57] <Cork> specially the deprication warning of the options your using
[08:33:29] <paule32> so, with absolute path ad DOCUMENT_ROOT  /foo1/foo2/bar.php
[08:33:35] <paule32> page error load
[08:34:28] <Cork> uh
[08:34:42] <Cork> document root is NOT what you should use for ajax calls...
[08:35:09] <Cork> docugment root points to the root path that is excluded from the public url
[08:35:21] <paule32> yes it is
[08:35:39] <paule32> http://my.domain.tld points to /
[08:35:51] <paule32> foo1/foo2  are the sub folders
[08:36:10] <paule32> so, absolute path is /foo1/foo2
[08:37:03] <Cork> my point is that DOCUMENT_ROOT and domain urls aren't the same thing
[08:37:29] <paule32> i know
[08:37:49] <Cork> then why are you mixing them up in the comments your making...
[08:38:17] <paule32> to better understand what i would like?
[08:38:21] <paule32> sorry
[08:38:51] <Cork> you would have to take the full path of the file you have on the server
[08:39:03] <Cork> remove the document root from that
[08:39:20] <Cork> and you have the absolute url you can use in the url
[08:41:24] <Cork> anyway that should still give you errors in the ajax call if you give it the wrong url
[08:42:39] <Cork> also have a look in the server logs for a lookup error if you don't
[10:43:57] <paule32> hello
[10:44:12] <paule32> who from you use the ace web editor?
[10:44:29] <paule32> i get message:  ReferenceError: ace is not defined  ext-language_tools.js:1:1
[10:48:12] <paule32> here: http://dpaste.com/0XE3FMV
[10:48:27] <paule32> you can see, how i use the loader of scripts
[11:03:47] <lanky_leguan> why does JQMIGRATE call things deprecated, that are not in the Deprecated category of the jQuery documentation?
[11:12:11] <berndj> i really don't like specifying button text for a dialog in js. seems like an abstraction violation, mixing presentation with logic like that. is it kosher or at least reasonable to write out the <button>s oneself in the dialog div and then .button()ize them explicitly?
[18:38:22] <taplar> i have to say i'm not a fan of the room changing its font color to white
[18:38:24] <taplar> woah!
[19:15:45] <shoky_> wut
