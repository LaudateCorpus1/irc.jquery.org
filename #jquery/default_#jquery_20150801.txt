[00:41:28] <dubkoidragon> hey guys, I haveea quick question do I need to add another script tag in my HTML doc in order to use jqueryui??
[00:41:48] <dubkoidragon> jQuery UI **
[00:44:16] <TaxtacalJackl> yes
[00:54:02] <dubkoidragon> TaxtacalJackl: So is this the same as downloading the js text for it and then putting it under the script tag for my jquery file?
[01:00:01] <TaxtacalJackl> dubkoidragon: yes you'll need a css file as well
[01:02:32] <dubkoidragon> TaxtacalJackl: oh man u mean ano
[01:02:38] <dubkoidragon> anotehr css file to point at
[01:03:57] <TaxtacalJackl> you need another script tag to include jquery ui and another css file to include the styles for it

[06:59:50] <DarkChaoz> anyone here
[08:33:38] <duckxx_> hi DarkChaoz
[08:34:39] <duckxx_> this is a pretty easy mistake... can someone tell me whats wrong here? http://prntscr.com/7zmmpj .. i just want to output the "formatDecimal" outside of the function call... im just getting a undefined when doing that.. not sure why.
[10:15:29] <Whiskey> Can someone help me check https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/gpv5sLbh/5/ this one, i have two console.log, the t variable are diffrent on those places where it loggs, what i don´t get is where it is set and is it someway to change how to set it in that command?
[10:16:41] <Whiskey> what i need t to be is the one before the } else {, but i don´t know how to do det manually when you need it
[10:24:45] <Whiskey> Here is a working example, https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/325u8htt/
[10:30:41] <BruteShot> hey guys
[10:30:44] <BruteShot> bit confused over here
[10:31:49] <BruteShot> I'm retrieving a bunch of elements via somevar = $('selector'), I can output these to console, np, but if I do somevar[0].attr('id'), I get somevar[0].attr is not a function
[10:31:53] <BruteShot> any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[10:41:22] <Uhkis> BruteShot: use .get(0)
[10:43:29] <BruteShot> Uhkis: I'll give that a shot, hey, didn't I already meet you on #drupal?
[10:43:38] <BruteShot> Uhkis: Name sounds familiar
[10:43:54] <Kartagis> yes, he hangs out in #drupal too
[10:44:04] <Kartagis> btw, you should come back
[10:44:18] <BruteShot> Haha sup Kartagis!
[10:44:30] <Kartagis> the other day, I was trying to remember your nick
[10:44:53] <Kartagis> came from outside, and gotta eat now
[10:44:59] <BruteShot> I'm working on a huge ml project right now, I can't be on #drupal!  I get sucked in conversation and time just flies by haha
[10:45:00] <Kartagis> how about you?
[10:45:09] <Kartagis> ml?
[10:45:13] <BruteShot> Everything great, busy busy busy
[10:45:14] <BruteShot> machine learning
[10:45:21] <Kartagis> owkay
[10:45:33] <BruteShot> Haven't done any math in like 10 years, it's brutal
[10:45:34] <Kartagis> it's been 4 months
[10:45:46] <BruteShot> haha, it's going to be longer :P
[10:45:55] <Kartagis> sure dude
[10:47:07] <BruteShot> hmm, .get didn't do the trick
[10:48:14] <BruteShot> this is really weird, console log somevar.get(0) outputs the object, but .get(0
[10:48:22] <BruteShot> ).attr('id') throws an error
[10:48:47] <BruteShot> #fatfingers
[10:51:16] <Kartagis> go on a diet man!
[10:51:26] <BruteShot> haha
[10:51:32] <BruteShot> I need exercise, not a diet
[10:51:36] <BruteShot> I don't move at all these days
[10:52:02] <Kartagis> damn, I'm stuck here aga,n
[10:52:10] <Kartagis> gotta go eat
[10:52:16] <Kartagis> okay I'm out
[10:52:18] <BruteShot> haha, bon appetit
[10:58:14] <BruteShot> heh, even the demo at http://api.jquery.com/attr/ is broken
[10:58:16] <BruteShot> that's not a good sign
[11:01:10] <BruteShot> ok nm, got it
[11:06:08] <rindolf> BruteShot: good. :-)
[11:12:43] <Uhkis> BruteShot: yes you did
[11:15:23] <Uhkis> BruteShot: you probably remember something like ikush better tho :D
[11:51:55] <rindolf> Hmm... I recall this channel had over 900 participants. I wonder what happened.
[13:11:22] <dubkoidragon> hey I'm having triouble understanding which version of jQuery UI i should be dling
[13:11:36] <dubkoidragon> or the differences between them
[13:13:26] <rindolf> dubkoidragon: where's the dilemma?
[13:19:28] <bastones> dubkoidragon : The only difference you should be aware of is 1.11.x is not tested against IE 7 like 1.10.x was, and any bugs found in IE 7 will not be fixed. However 1.11.x still contains all the IE 7 workarounds from 1.10.x. In any case, you should use the latest release.
[13:26:46] <dubkoidragon> Ok, next problem i'm having is in my html file I put the script call after teh first jquery call, but before my jquery file call, and I put the jquery css call before my other css file, and it doesnt seem to wrok :/
[13:29:17] <dubkoidragon> I don't understand how or what i need to call for in the ehad of my html doc in order to make this work
[13:29:51] <bastones> I didn't understand that. Can you show me your HTML code via jsfiddle.net please?
[13:30:36] <dubkoidragon> yes i will go there now and send u the link, what u need to know is that I downloaded jquery ui and i have the files now so I will send you the code I have in the head of my doc
[13:30:37] <dubkoidragon> one sec
[13:31:53] <dubkoidragon> http://jsfiddle.net/8mvprugx/
[13:31:56] <dubkoidragon> there you go
[13:36:47] <dubkoidragon> did u get that bastones?
[13:38:01] <bastones> So what is the problem, dubkoidragon? Are you saying the jQuery UI library isn't working?
[13:38:36] <dubkoidragon> yes
[13:39:06] <dubkoidragon> is there something wrong with my syntax, or the order of calls on the tags
[13:39:48] <bastones> Can you check the Developer Tools and see if any errors are being displayed under the JavaScript tab? (Ctrl + Shift + I)
[13:40:22] <bastones> The order seems fine to me, but I may be overlooking something. The main thing is calling jquery-ui.js after jquery.js, since jQuery UI relies on the core jQuery library.
[13:40:57] <dubkoidragon> kk one sec
[13:45:03] <dubkoidragon> The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol. webtest.html
[13:45:03] <dubkoidragon> TypeError: $(...).effect is not a function
[13:50:53] <dubkoidragon> ya I dont really know what that means, except for the last one telling me that ffect is not a function meeaning that its not finding the ui library
[13:52:33] <bastones> What about the Network Tab? Any 404 errors? Are you sure the jQuery UI lib is being loaded?
[13:54:43] <dubkoidragon> hey, I got it figured out. the library that I loaded into the same file as the rest of the docs was corrupted when i copy/pasted it. I have no idea how that happeneed. but I appriciate your help thanks
[13:54:54] <dubkoidragon> i had to recopy and apste
[13:55:24] <bastones> No problem, dubkoidragon. Glad it's sorted for you.
[13:57:28] <dubkoidragon> bastones: thx again, and I look forward to jquerying with y'all in the next forseeable future :)
[15:32:28] <dan_j> Hi. I have a footer which docks to the bottom of the screen if there is not enough content in the body. If the window is resized smaller, the footer undocks and moves to the bottom of the content.
[15:33:16] <dan_j>  If the content is expanded using slideDown, i also want to undock the footer and place it at the bottom of the content. I tried using the slidedown callback to achieve this, but the footer only moves when the animation is complete and therefore doesn't look too good.
[15:33:58] <dan_j> How can I run a check during the animation to ensure the footer is undocked immediately when the content hits it?
[15:47:37] <dan_j> Tried $('#bodywrapper').resize(function(){something}) but that doesnt seem to trigger.
[15:52:28] <bastones> dan_j : If you want to detect when the window is resized, use $(window).resize()
[15:53:52] <dan_j> Ive got the window resize done. But i want to also detect content resize.
[15:55:05] <bastones> dan_j : Meaning when the width of a container changes?
[16:05:20] <dan_j> Height
[16:12:08] <bastones> Off the top of my head, use $(window).resize() and within the callback function, check the .height() of the HTML container.

[22:11:19] <ozd> guys did any of you learn angularjs after having some good jquery skills? and how long and hard was it to get a good understanding of it?
[22:48:01] <_genuser_> hello folks. $("#<class>").trigger('click');  is this jquery or bootstrap?
[23:24:45] <ozd> guys did any of you learn angularjs after having some good jquery skills? and how long and hard was it to get a good understanding of it?
[23:56:40] <ozd> guys i am going to use a template (metronic) for my project
[23:56:52] <ozd> it has html version and an angular js version
[23:57:11] <ozd> the angular js version has less amount of components and integrations for plugins etc.
[23:57:44] <ozd> i want to use angular js but should I be worried that there might be a specific reason why the implementor didnt put all features altogether to angular js?
