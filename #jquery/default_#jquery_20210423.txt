[09:56:49] <P1ckleRick> hey
[10:20:28] <robertparkerx> how can I target dynamic added html?
[10:20:37] <robertparkerx> I've tried .on('click'
[10:22:00] <robertparkerx> I think I got it
[10:37:35] <robertparkerx> Okay I've got that working but I'm unsure of how to look for text to appear (thank you message) and perform redirect when it finds it
[10:58:04] <robertparkerx> I got it
