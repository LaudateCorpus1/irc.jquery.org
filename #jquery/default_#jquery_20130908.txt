[00:01:27] <LeBlaaanc> ehh
[00:01:38] <LeBlaaanc> I'm thinking I can compute it
[00:04:46] <cliffreich> hey guys, I'm having a problem with jquery validator plugin, well in fact nothing happens. i tried this (top answer) to use tooltip stackoverflow.com/questions/4381476/jquery-tooltip-to-display-validator-messages
[00:05:06] <beardtree> Cork: should I give up?
[00:05:07] <cliffreich> i dont know a lot of jquery so maybe there is something missing in there
[00:05:58] <cliffreich> i added div and made rule for my own input fields with required and custom msg. it didnt work
[00:06:01] <cliffreich> any help?
[00:06:35] <Cork> beardtree: no, i think you should simplify the problem
[00:06:55] <Cork> beardtree: go over to a static html file and only javascript
[00:06:56] <beardtree> Cork: you understand it better than I do, can you give me a rundown?
[00:07:40] <Cork> beardtree: the asyncness of the current page makes it hard to debug
[00:08:23] <Cork> beardtree: take the code and try to reproduce it in jsfiddle.net
[00:08:27] <Cork> without websocket
[00:08:39] <Cork> just static data, in js and the template
[00:08:48] <Cork> that should be a good starting point
[00:09:19] <b0nn> hm, I have a number of dbcalls in a phpfile, let's call it dbcalls.php, one of the calls is get_five(){}; Is it possible (and a good idea) to call just that function from jQuery? Or is it better to make a set of php files so that jQuery only sends data to the assigned php file for the desired call?
[00:09:51] <Cork> b0nn: you can't call a pho function from js
[00:10:04] <b0nn> :(
[00:10:05] <Cork> php*
[00:10:17] <Cork> b0nn: php is server side, js is client side
[00:10:33] <Cork> you have to have a network connection to do anything on the other side
[00:10:41] <b0nn> so option 1) pass data such that my php selects the appropriate caal or option b) write a php file for each call?
[00:10:44] <Cork> and that implies requesting a file
[00:10:49] <Cork> s/file/resource/
[00:11:12] <Cork> b0nn: i would go with a parameter to the resource
[00:11:33] <b0nn> ta
[00:11:36] <Cork> something like the-php-resource.php?q=query
[00:12:02] <Cork> just make sure you escape the query data before you give it to your sql backend!
[00:12:31] <stroodlepup> Cork, It works great. thanks a lot
[00:12:47] <cliffreich> anyone willing to help me?
[00:13:58] <LeBlaaanc> cliffreich: provide an example?
[00:15:24] <cliffreich> yep, here http://pastebin.com/sLQNz9w1
[00:16:01] <LeBlaaanc> cliffreich: working example? All you've provided was that it's not working?
[00:16:22] <LeBlaaanc> or a working broken example heh
[00:17:20] <cliffreich> i copied that from the stackoverflow answer for jquery validation + tooltip. and didn't work for me... nothing happens :/
[00:17:34] <cliffreich> from here stackoverflow.com/questions/4381476/jquery-tooltip-to-display-validator-messages
[00:17:53] <LeBlaaanc> ya well we can't help it could be a plethora of things that is wrong.
[00:18:17] <LeBlaaanc> without your implementation of said example.
[00:18:22] <cliffreich> it helps if i send you the url?
[00:18:23] <cliffreich> ah ok
[00:18:43] <cliffreich> ok give me a min
[00:20:10] <beardtree> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rkwnB/
[00:20:14] <beardtree> Now nothing is happening
[00:24:28] <cliffreich> ok
[00:24:30] <cliffreich> here is the example

[00:28:21] <Cork> beardtree: checking
[00:29:15] <LeBlaaanc> I just realized something, I am going to drive all the way to oregon. I could drive all the way to belize the same distance.

[00:30:43] <LeBlaaanc> wonder if I'd get mugged on my way through mexico
[00:31:15] <ph88> cliffreich: why joomla ??
[00:31:33] <cliffreich> and yes we have internet here. its hard to connect because the jungle, the monkeys and stuff. our sea monkeys love to bite submarine data cable
[00:31:46] <cliffreich> because it's easy and customer wanted joomla
[00:31:51] <Cork> beardtree: http://jsfiddle.net/rkwnB/1/
[00:32:02] <cliffreich> id choose django
[00:32:14] <LeBlaaanc> cliffreich: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'validate'
[00:32:18] <ph88> oh nice you can do python :)
[00:32:26] <LeBlaaanc> sooo your validate has not been loaded
[00:32:30] <cliffreich> but its only to show cars... not really a booking system at all.

[00:41:00] <Cork> beardtree: ok, i see where the problem is now
[00:41:57] <Cork> beardtree: hole doesn't handle if the element is the top in the template
[00:42:04] <Cork> as it only uses find
[00:49:11] <cliffreich> i tried firebug i couldnt find anything
[00:50:13] <cliffreich> and i had to use html5 validator
[00:52:16] <LeBlaaanc> cliffreich: ?
[00:52:29] <LeBlaaanc> seems like you fixed something
[00:53:33] <cliffreich> oh what

[02:22:26] <DansVC> Hello
[02:22:44] <DansVC> Someone can help me?
[02:23:32] <DansVC> I can make a selector like this: $("input[value="+value+"]")...  ?
[02:35:00] <thatjoshguy> I'm looking for a bit of assistance with a really strange one
[02:36:02] <thatjoshguy> I have this code right http://dpaste.com/1370387/
[02:36:59] <thatjoshguy> And, for some reason, jQuery is firing the .fail() promise even though its a successful response.
[02:38:36] <thatjoshguy> The output of the status confirms that, http://dpaste.com/1370398/ as does the backend code and browser logs
[02:39:45] <shoky> thatjoshguy: log the other arguments to the fail callback. could be a JSON parse error for example
[02:40:40] <thatjoshguy> ahhh
[02:41:58] <thatjoshguy> I'm getting a parse error for unexpected token :
[02:42:19] <thatjoshguy> Python's json.dumps() not producing valid json?
[02:43:05] <shoky> check the actual response text
[02:49:18] <thatjoshguy> yeah, its just {"status": "success"}
[02:50:48] <shoky> what's the response content-type header?
[02:51:06] <shoky> try  $.post("/parse", $("form").serialize(), 'json')    maybe
[02:51:23] <shoky> where did you see the unexpected token :   ?
[02:57:46] <thatjoshguy> Content-Type	application/javascript; charset=utf8
[02:57:47] <thatjoshguy> hmmm
[03:05:23] <shoky> thatjoshguy: ok well that's the wrong type. did you try adding 'json' ?
[03:06:34] <thatjoshguy> oh duh
[03:06:53] <thatjoshguy> Thanks for your help shoky
[03:06:58] <shoky> np
[03:16:25] <Aric_> Why would this return: NAY!
[03:16:26] <Aric_> if ($.inArray("en", ["en","ar","id"])) { console.log('YEA!'); } else { console.log('NAY!'); }
[03:18:21] <shoky> Aric_:  $.inArray doesn't return true/false, it returns the index or -1 if not found
[03:18:33] <Aric_> ah true thanks
[03:18:43] <Aric_> been going at an app for awhile so
[03:18:45] <Asmooh> !helpme
[03:18:49] <Aric_> >0 should work fine?
[03:19:01] <shoky> no
[03:19:12] <shoky> >=0  would, but i prefer  !== -1
[03:19:32] <Asmooh> whats wrong with > 0?
[03:19:49] <shoky> 0 means index 0, means it was found
[03:19:54] <Aric_> 0 could be first result
[03:19:59] <shoky> exactly..
[03:19:59] <Aric_> and yes !== -1 is superior
[03:20:00] <Aric_> ty
[03:20:28] <Aric_> only one result gives -1 so not -1 is best
[03:20:35] <shoky> hm?
[03:32:27] <Asmooh> how can i fix this

[05:28:55] <cdkdang> hi i'm an absolute noob who need a little help from all the gurus in this room
[05:30:41] <cdkdang> i want to monitor all my inputs onkeyup and so use the following jquery $(document).ready(function(){$('input').keyup(function(){alert("keypress detected")})})
[05:30:51] <cdkdang> which works fine
[05:31:45] <cdkdang> my prob is i have inputs dynamically added after the page has loaded and does not work with those
[05:32:36] <cdkdang> is there a way to get it to work with inputs that were dynamically added after the page has loaded?
[05:33:38] <k1ng> cdkdang, http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:33:44] <cdkdang> i can just add onkeyup events to each input but i rather it simple and slim line with a universal function for all inputs
[05:33:54] <cdkdang> ah cool thanks king
[05:34:01] <cdkdang> i'll look into it.
[05:34:07] <cdkdang> it'll take me a while to understand
[05:35:31] <k1ng> $("body").on("click", "p", function(){
[05:35:31] <k1ng>   $(this).after("<p>Another paragraph! "+(++count)+"</p>");
[05:35:32] <k1ng> });
[05:35:44] <k1ng> cdkdang, its simple as hell
[05:36:30] <cdkdang> king... I'm a dumbass noob.
[05:36:38] <cdkdang> even simple things are complicated to me! lol
[05:36:40] <cdkdang> XD
[05:37:23] <jop008> I wnat to send an email with linebreaks in it. The text can be adjusted using textarea field on jqm
[05:37:36] <jop008> How to handle html tags like <br/>
[05:37:52] <cdkdang> thanks king i think i get it. will spend some time and try it
[05:38:00] <k1ng>  $(document).ready($("body").on("keyup", "input", function(){alert("keypress detected")}))
[05:38:21] <cdkdang> man you made it easy for me king.

[05:42:00] <cdkdang> onkeyup
[05:43:50] <cdkdang> what does $("#dataTable tbody tr") from http://api.jquery.com/on/ mean?
[05:44:19] <cdkdang> sorry i must sound so stupid :(
[05:45:14] <dabear> cdkdang: do something to all trs who have tbody parents who are a decendant of #dataTable
[05:45:35] <cdkdang> ah okay thanks dabear
[05:46:32] <cdkdang> so if i try a modification of kings example $(document).ready($("form input").on("keyup", "input", function(){alert("keypress detected")}))?
[05:50:03] <p3lim> Is there a way to delay a function somehow?

[06:41:06] <Asmooh> i cannot click on it
[06:41:13] <Asmooh> and it doesnt take the css layout it should do
[06:41:56] <rgr> why have you escaped the "s?
[06:42:29] <Asmooh> where to you see an S
[06:42:32] <Asmooh> do*
[06:43:15] <Asmooh> except class
[06:45:18] <grafi-> why is that even a jquery question oÃ´
[06:59:07] <rgr> Asmooh: Ill assume you're joking.
[06:59:28] <Asmooh> i know its the wrong channel yes
[06:59:56] <Asmooh> but why something like this doesnt work i dont get, thats how it works in php

[07:00:56] <jop008> is there a push unqie function ?
[07:01:06] <jop008> so if unique add it to array
[07:17:20] <d0den> I can't get the jquery-mobile custom builder [ http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ ] to work. Even if I tick every box, my locally hosted custom version of jquery-mobile doesn't work and I get the console error "define is not defined"
[07:20:26] <jemt> Hi. jqueryui.com is not working properly. Several resources time out - e.g. http://jqueryui.com/download/ - keeps loading for ever - seems to have something to do with the Theme section since CSS Scope can no longer be set. Same goes for Theme Roller - keeps loading and loading
[07:20:38] <gvo> jop008 use an associative array.
[07:21:09] <jop008> already solved with a self made function
[07:41:59] <hello> <hello> Hi, how can I make this bounce effect to appear on a mouseclick instead of just starting by itself when I refresh the page? http://jsfiddle.net/chG8L/
[07:46:54] <tw2113> attach it to a click event
[07:49:40] <gordian> hello: http://jsfiddle.net/chG8L/1/
[07:56:32] <hello> gordian: It seems your code only works one time and then you have to reload the page to get it to work again.
[07:57:31] <gordian> maybe you're using an outdated browser, because it works over and over for me
[08:00:58] <tw2113> i can only get it to run once too, and i'm on Firefox 25
[08:06:48] <Successful> http://jsbin.com/aYuloFi/1/ <-- Show do i remove div class from the last div inside ul.wpp_list ?
[08:07:40] <Successful> How*
[08:22:14] <gordian> Successful: you can do $('.wpp-list div:last-child').removeClass('whatever');
[08:22:36] <gordian> actually you'll want to do $('.wpp-list > div:last-child').removeClass('whatever');
[08:22:43] <gordian> should be fine
[08:23:26] <Successful> [gordian] haha so simple, ty
[08:24:16] <Successful> [gordian] what is the difference ?
[08:24:42] <tw2113> the latter affects only divs that are direct children of .wpp-list
[08:24:52] <Successful> ok ty :)
[08:24:54] <tw2113> in case you re-use the class you want to remove, elsewhere
[08:29:01] <gordian> yeah, the first one will affect ALL div last children in the .wpp-list
[08:29:08] <gordian> latter is only for top level div children
[08:31:01] <hello> gordian: and tw2113:, I've solved it in an other way, http://jsfiddle.net/chG8L/3/
[08:31:23] <tw2113> whatever works hello
[08:31:53] <gordian> haha if you say so hello
[08:33:38] <hello> I know this isn't exactly what I searched for in the beginning but it will work for now). Thank you anyways guys!

[09:39:51] <Ziber> I've just discovered the draggable plugin and I'm trying to understand how the "constrain" works. My intended result is to have a bunch of ULs, side by side, that can be draggable on the x-axis. And within those ULs, I want the li's to be draggable, "constrained" to the UL itself, on the y-axis. This should be relatively simple, but I'm having some trouble with it.
[09:52:15] <p3lim> Anyone here used jquery-indexeddb?
[09:52:22] <p3lim> Getting issues with this: http://paste.p3lim.net/6p21as
[09:52:50] <p3lim> Specifically, this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'close' of undefined"
[09:54:11] <DelphiWorld> hello jqueryers
[09:54:27] <DelphiWorld> please guys, can someone help me integrating 2 of jquery mobile projects?
[09:55:34] <DelphiWorld> i'm blind a nd js is so clumpy for me:P
[09:57:04] <tw2113> medically or figuratively blind?
[10:01:43] <beardtree> Hey Cork http://jsfiddle.net/VM5QM/
[10:08:10] <Manusoftar> is there a way to import jquery globally on a website based on frameset so i dont have to import it on each file?
[10:08:57] <beardtree> Can anyone help me figure out this weird issue? "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getComputedStyle' of null" http://jsfiddle.net/VM5QM/
[10:09:13] <beardtree> The error is line 20 of the JS
[10:11:12] <Reck_> I am trying to get inArray() to work. However, it is really bugging me. I hope someone can help: http://jsfiddle.net/ZPMEG/
[10:20:55] <beardtree> Reck_: inArray returns the index if it's in the array or -1 if it's not
[10:21:09] <beardtree> use !== -1 instead
[10:21:10] <Reck_> beardtree: I found out, thanks!
[10:24:40] <Reck_> How can I find out if this array: http://pastebin.com/5xhJXLkD - have an item with the ID 3?
[10:27:16] <beardtree> Reck_: $.filter(array, function (item) { return item.id === '3'; })
[10:33:36] <Reck_> beardtree: I can't get that to work
[10:35:25] <coderDJ412> So you guys are suggesting using another controller besides the pages controller for my index page. What are some of the things you consider when choosing which controller to init your app?
[10:35:59] <lundy> hi folk
[10:36:01] <coderDJ412> oops, sorry
[10:43:03] <beardtree> Reck_: did you look at the output?
[10:44:46] <p3lim> Any of you used jquery-indexeddb before?
[10:45:17] <beardtree> p3lim: why would you use jquery-indexeddb if it has nothing to do with DOM manipulation?
[10:46:00] <p3lim> Simplifies transactions, indexeddb is horrible by itself
[10:46:35] <Manusoftar> i can't get this to work -> http://jsfiddle.net/dzZzK/ any idea why?
[10:47:13] <beardtree> Manusoftar: what should it do that it doesn't?
[10:47:40] <Manusoftar> append the id of the field which fire the event on the body
[10:47:53] <Manusoftar> actually i hardcoded the message
[10:48:10] <CWSpear> Google hasn't really turned anything up for me. Does anyone know of a jQuery animations library that's optimized for mobile animations (i.e. uses the proper hacks for smoother transitions)?
[10:48:50] <beardtree> CWSpear: not a jQuery animations library -- straight CSS instead: http://daneden.me/animate/
[10:49:51] <beardtree> Manusoftar: still unclear
[10:50:30] <beardtree> You have a return; call which stops everything below it from executing
[10:50:34] <CWSpear> I mostly need to move stuff around the page or slideUp/Down, but it's jagged with straight jQuery, CSS transitions don't work with height/width auto, and so I was using a combination of the two as it is
[10:50:43] <Manusoftar> i need to identify which of the inputs fired the keyPressed event but nothing happens, is like the 'evento' param does not get the event args
[10:51:40] <Manusoftar> i didnt realize i had to update so you can see the code i modified -> http://jsfiddle.net/dzZzK/3/
[10:52:12] <beardtree> Manusoftar: you did not test your code properly
[10:52:47] <beardtree> Open your JS console and notice the syntax error
[10:52:55] <beardtree> Whenever you write JS the first thing you should do is open the console
[10:54:24] <Manusoftar> upps i missed a (
[10:54:28] <Reck_> On line 7 it outputs the object I need. However, line 2 gives me "undefined" - anyone can help me out? http://pastebin.com/jRK2WUux
[10:54:28] <Manusoftar> thanks
[10:55:36] <beardtree> Reck_: many things wrong with what you have
[10:55:56] <beardtree> Line 8 will return the anonymous function defined at line 5, not findItem
[10:56:26] <Reck_> beardtree: Oh yes, of course... I am very new with this stuff
[10:56:41] <Reck_> beardtree: What else is wrong? :-P
[10:56:46] <beardtree> Reck_: function findItem (id) { return $.filter(items, function (item) { return item.id === id; })[0]; }
[11:00:40] <mateobur> Hello
[11:00:42] <Reck_> beardtree: This is not working: http://pastebin.com/U8Ak3DEm
[11:00:49] <mateobur> can I download jquery ui 1.10.4 from anywhere
[11:00:50] <mateobur> ?
[11:01:05] <mateobur> I need it to bypass chrome bugs, but still not published
[11:01:08] <beardtree> Reck_: "not working"
[11:01:12] <beardtree> Reck_: http://jsfiddle.net
[11:02:00] <beardtree> mateobur: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[11:02:05] <beardtree> 1.10.4 is unreleased
[11:02:22] <beardtree> You can clone the github repo and use what they have currently that will be released for 1.10.4 sometime in the future
[11:03:15] <mateobur> beardtree, thanks, let's see if I manage to build that
[11:06:54] <Reck_> beardtree: This is the error I get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined
[11:07:04] <beardtree> Reck_: that's great. JSfiddle
[11:13:15] <Reck_> beardtree: http://jsfiddle.net/dhFJC/
[11:16:04] <beardtree> Reck_: the AJAX call is broken due to CORS restriction
[11:16:29] <Reck_> beardtree: I don't know what that means :-P It is working locally at least
[11:17:06] <Reck_> beardtree: I am not sure how else to get http://87.50.122.53:8888/aa.json into JSFiddle
[11:17:12] <beardtree> Reck_: don't
[11:17:15] <beardtree> Use the literal JSON
[11:19:45] <Manusoftar> i'm still trying to make my jquery script to work, here are my codes -> http://pastebin.com/uUddicrB (this one calls a function on a js file which does the ajax stuff) -> http://pastebin.com/GykfQhxu (here is the function that takes care of the ajax thing) of  course being asynchronous it probable wouldn't work the way it's done cause this is an old code i made before and i used it in a
[11:19:46] <Manusoftar> synchronous way (bad idea i know!)
[11:21:32] <Manusoftar> The thing is i call it from a page where theres a signup form, i need to check wheter the desired username and email are avaible on the fly, in case any of em are not available i have to show a div which is right at the side of the related input which shows the error message! but i'm not sure who to make the whole thing
[11:29:59] <doug65536> is there really no way to do this: var a = $('#a'), b = $('#b');  $(a, b, ...).doStuff...
[11:30:12] <doug65536> other than [0] crap
[11:30:55] <doug65536> my example is less interesting than intended. say one was $('.a')
[11:31:02] <beardtree> doug65536: $('#a, #b, #c').doStuff
[11:31:11] <beardtree> But that's gross, use a class
[11:31:16] <doug65536> I know that...
[11:31:40] <doug65536> I mean, take multiple existing jqueries and do stuff
[11:31:53] <beardtree> doug65536: $().add()
[11:32:10] <beardtree> $([$a, $b, $c])
[11:32:27] <doug65536> beardtree: are you sure that works?
[11:32:47] <beardtree> doug65536: you need to learn how to get helped on IRC
[11:32:57] <doug65536> beardtree: I looked pretty carefully at the docs
[11:34:40] <doug65536> a.add(b).add(c).doStuff is what I need
[11:35:54] <doug65536> beardtree: you mad?
[11:36:54] <p3lim> Woot, took me half an hour to figure out why all my data got substracted one character per line (and adding), ended up beeing a bad Base64 encoder that didn't support utf-8 :o
[11:37:21] <Manusoftar> I was able to put it on jsFiddle for you to take a look -> http://jsfiddle.net/PCcu2/1/
[11:37:44] <beardtree> doug65536: lol
[11:37:49] <Manusoftar> if you put my nick name -> manusoftar on the first field it should tell you it is already registered
[11:38:33] <Manusoftar> but nothing happens, of course due to asychronism but how to fix it?
[11:39:32] <doug65536> Manusoftar: in js, something being asynchronous rarely causes anything to be more difficult
[11:40:29] <Manusoftar> the thing is that i should have access to the main htm where the form is from the ajax.js where the asynchronous stuff is done to show the messages if needed
[11:40:39] <Manusoftar> but i don't like that idea
[11:40:43] <SDr> hi, got flowplayer problem: some users are getting "Flowplayer playback error: 3: Video not properly encoded" error (which I also receive via window.onerror magic). Any idea where problems of this kind might be best posted?
[11:41:31] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I don't see anything asynchronous at all. what part is async?
[11:42:40] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ah, the ajax.js
[11:42:44] <Manusoftar> doug65536: the verifyName function calls a function defined in ajax.js which makes an asynchronous call to a php to look for that username on the database
[11:43:19] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you really do everything the hard way. you should use jquery instead of directly using the DOM
[11:44:15] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ok at least you use $.get...
[11:44:54] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you thing $.get waits? what does that return true and return false think it is returning to?
[11:44:59] <doug65536> think*
[11:45:09] <Manusoftar> doug65536: it is not a thing of making it the hard, is that i'm just starting with jQuery
[11:45:53] <doug65536> Manusoftar: the easy way to do what you're doing is to pass a completion function to verifyName that is called with the result as a parameter
[11:46:31] <Manusoftar> thats the point, i should somehow make changes on the original page depending on the result of that ajax call, but i dont feel right by sending the reference to the div through the function
[11:46:37] <doug65536> Manusoftar: then, the lines that call verifyAjax can do something like: verifyName(name, function(ok) { if (!ok) { ... show the error div .. } else { .. hide the error div .. });
[11:47:30] <doug65536> Manusoftar: and change verifyName to call the callback with the true/false, instead of that useless return true/false
[11:48:13] <Manusoftar> what do you mean by changing the verifyName to call the callback??
[11:48:32] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I would be able to edit it and show you if it wasn't hidden inside a file on your server...
[11:48:49] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I'll write what I suggest in the fiddle anyway
[11:49:38] <Manusoftar> i can give you an ftp credentials if you want but i don't want to  abuselp dude!
[11:49:49] <Manusoftar> abuse of your help*
[11:50:14] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I don't need ftp. it should be obvious once I show you
[11:50:22] <Manusoftar> by the way i want to apologyse for the many errors i may have commited in my writing but im a spanish speaker...
[11:51:12] <Manusoftar> apologyze*
[11:52:29] <Manusoftar> i'm very gratefull already for all the help and advises you gave so far doug65536!
[11:53:32] <doug65536> Manusoftar: look at the verifyName function I wrote, and look at how I used it at line 44
[11:53:34] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/PCcu2/2/
[11:53:50] <p3lim> Any of you know a reliable Base64 encoder/decoder that supports UTF-8?
[11:54:51] <d0den> could anyone tell me why IE10 throws an exception on this jQuery code? http://pastebin.com/nYw6g02h
[11:55:08] <d0den> it gives an InvalidStateError
[11:55:11] <doug65536> Manusoftar: my fiddle isn't a drop-in solution because you expect to be able to return success or failure immediately from evalData, which is a completely wrong way to handle it
[11:55:13] <leknoppix> hello, somebody watch the error of my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/gMGEJ/
[11:55:29] <vladikoff> d0den, are you in the right State?
[11:55:40] <doug65536> Manusoftar: to make it properly async, you could make evalData take a callback too... and call that with the success or failure information
[11:55:47] <d0den> vladikoff, I don't know what that means in this context I'm afraid
[11:56:13] <VictorCL> hi I am getting this error , jquery-1.10.1.min.map 404 (Not Found)
[11:56:19] <VictorCL> have no idea what is that file
[11:56:34] <VictorCL> I found some reference to it on the jquery souce code
[11:56:40] <doug65536> VictorCL: it is a file that lets it translate a minified file back to readable source
[11:56:50] <doug65536> VictorCL: you can disable that in the debugger options
[11:57:01] <VictorCL> what debugger options?
[11:57:12] <doug65536> VictorCL: the gear icon at the bottom right
[11:57:16] <vladikoff> VictorCL, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18365315/jquerys-jquery-1-10-2-min-map-is-triggering-a-404-not-found
[11:57:52] <VictorCL> ok I see , thanks
[11:58:25] <d0den> it throws the error on line 4, character 11 if that's any help
[11:58:25] <doug65536> VictorCL: "Enable source maps"
[11:58:36] <d0den> excuse me, line 5 character 11
[11:58:41] <VictorCL> got it , thanks
[11:58:48] <VictorCL> it it doestn mess my javscript is fine then
[11:59:41] <Manusoftar> doug65536: i've checked at your modifications but it still doesn't work, i write manusoftar on the "Nombre de usuario" field and it just dont show the error div which should be shown since i have that username registered into the db!
[12:00:06] <vladikoff> d0den, is that player making an ajax request?
[12:01:01] <doug65536> Manusoftar: yes because your code has wrong expectations...
[12:01:16] <doug65536> Manusoftar: evalData can't immediately return whether it succeeded or failed
[12:01:44] <d0den> vladikoff, no, both glueplayer and player are simple html5 audio elements. That function is called when the volume slider is moved. If the new volume is above a certain level, the main player plays, and if the main player is at the start of the file, the second player plays as well
[12:01:53] <doug65536> Manusoftar: the code doesn't run on fiddle because of cross-site AJAX
[12:02:01] <doug65536> so I can't really test it...
[12:02:09] <doug65536> I suppose I could go through a cors proxy though
[12:02:53] <Manusoftar> whatever you need me to do just ask
[12:03:32] <Manusoftar> i'll check your modifications directly on my server to check if it works there
[12:06:15] <doug65536> Manusoftar: it won't fully work yet...
[12:06:35] <doug65536> Manusoftar: as I mentioned, the call to evalData has expectations that can't be met because of async
[12:08:09] <Manusoftar> so what could be a workaround for that
[12:08:27] <doug65536> Manusoftar: doing change...
[12:09:12] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ok, whoa. it does a bunch of ajax
[12:09:21] <Manusoftar> ??
[12:09:30] <doug65536> Manusoftar: proper way to do that is with deferred
[12:11:08] <Manusoftar> doug65536: it seamed to be easier the old way, you just set a function to be called whenever the asynchronous call was completed and the you made whatever change you needed through that function
[12:11:36] <doug65536> Manusoftar: yes that is easier way - but you do a bunch of ajax calls separately...
[12:12:04] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if you had one function that it called, it would be simple to use deferred to wait for all the results and do one callback
[12:12:47] <Manusoftar> doug65536: i was thinking, what if i pass the msg div reference to the verifyName function, that way, whenever the ajax call finishes, it could directly access the div to make it visible or to keep it hidden
[12:13:35] <doug65536> Manusoftar: that is a valid approach... but it doesn't solve your if (check the name && check the email) { then do something... } code structure
[12:14:08] <doug65536> because checking the name and checking the email are two separate ajax calls
[12:14:57] <doug65536> Manusoftar: but yes, what you said solves a lot of the problem
[12:15:39] <Manusoftar> doug65536: well i can always use a global variable to check it on that if, like first i use evalData to make all the ajax job and set the values for those global variables, then on that final if i only check the values of those variables
[12:15:59] <doug65536> Manusoftar: how do you know which one is "final"?
[12:16:30] <doug65536> Manusoftar: a hack is to have a counter, and only really handle it when ++counter == 2
[12:16:38] <doug65536> but it's very hacky and there are much better ways
[12:16:53] <Manusoftar> i used the wrong word, i didn't mean final in programming terms i just meant that the if we are talking cames way after the evalData function
[12:17:20] <Manusoftar> i should used LAST instead of FINAL
[12:17:26] <doug65536> yes, same thing
[12:17:57] <doug65536> Manusoftar: jquery has awesome ways to say, "do all these things, and when they're all done, do this"
[12:19:30] <doug65536> Manusoftar: like: var op1 = $.get(...stuff...), op2 = $.get(...stuff...); $.when(op1, op2).done(function() { ... });
[12:22:41] <doug65536> Manusoftar: in that .done handler, you can use op1.done(function(data) { outer_op1data = data; }) and same for op2 to get the data from op1 and op2 in there
[12:23:28] <doug65536> Manusoftar: or just store out the data in each callback for op1 and op2 in local variables, and read them in the done handler
[12:23:54] <shoky> you can also $.when(op1, op2).done(function(data1, data2) { ... })
[12:24:06] <doug65536> shoky: nice!
[12:25:38] <doug65536> shoky: data1 and data2 are jqxhr's?
[12:26:17] <shoky> doug65536: nope, they're the data arguments that are passed the success callbacks
[12:26:17] <doug65536> shoky: or are they really the data, and when/done only works when all succeeded
[12:26:27] <doug65536> awesome
[12:26:56] <sunbeam> Is there a way with javascript to record the voice of someone that browses a website (after he gives permission) ?
[12:27:09] <khmer> should i use ender or bower
[12:27:09] <sunbeam> HTML5 way with Flash fallback
[12:27:22] <snover> no
[12:27:25] <snover> yes
[12:27:36] <snover> you guys can figure out which answer goes with which question
[12:31:19] <Manusoftar> perhaps theres something im not understanding properly... when i use a $.get(url,data,function(){ ... }); that function is supossed to be executed right after the ajax call has finished?
[12:32:05] <khmer> yes!
[12:32:07] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if it succeeds
[12:32:14] <khmer> well, yes
[12:32:16] <Manusoftar> of course
[12:32:28] <khmer> snover: is one of those two an answer to my question
[12:33:04] <doug65536> Manusoftar:  $.get(url, data).done(function(data) { ... it succeeded... }).fail(function() { ...it failed... })
[12:33:46] <doug65536> Manusoftar: do that if you want/need to handle failures
[12:34:06] <Manusoftar> doug65536: i made some changes to my code -> http://pastebin.com/duArXt30 i call that function with a second param -> $('#msg') which is the id of the div that should become visible if the username is already in use
[12:34:56] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you forgot to add a parameter for callback
[12:34:58] <Manusoftar> actually i do var msg = $('#userMsg'); and then i use msg as the second param
[12:35:11] <doug65536> Manusoftar: or forgot to remove callback(...) calls
[12:35:34] <Manusoftar> do i need to use callback or i just can remove the callback calls
[12:35:35] <Manusoftar> ??
[12:35:52] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if the caller doesn't need to handle the cases, remove them
[12:35:58] <Manusoftar> ok
[12:36:37] <doug65536> Manusoftar: the way you have it now, it's "fire-and-forget". verifyName handles everything
[12:36:41] <leknoppix> somebody see my problem, http://pastebin.com/kyP3vn4T , i can get the status of the video?
[12:37:32] <Manusoftar> doug65536: is it dangerous or something that "fire-and-forget" or it just fine
[12:37:38] <Manusoftar> ?
[12:37:49] <doug65536> Manusoftar: in case that was confusing, it's a metaphor for guided missiles (you fire it and don't have to worry anymore, missile guidance takes care of the rest)
[12:38:16] <Manusoftar> in this case doesn't seem to work cause nothing happens :S
[12:39:07] <Manusoftar> i dont even see the alerts i put on there!
[12:39:13] <doug65536> Manusoftar: does the console.log happen?
[12:39:27] <Manusoftar> not
[12:39:34] <Manusoftar> no*
[12:39:45] <doug65536> anything come up in console, like errors?
[12:40:14] <Manusoftar> --
[12:40:14] <Manusoftar> [16:36:12.793] GET http://www.smon.com.ar/php/query.php?T=0&V=manusoftar [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 5101ms]
[12:40:48] <Manusoftar> thats all i get in console (i'm using the firefox developer toolbar) perhaps i should use firebug ??
[12:41:07] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you have a missing closing ) in the pastebin
[12:41:34] <doug65536> at the end
[12:41:49] <doug65536> });    <-- line 22 should look like that
[12:42:10] <Manusoftar> upps, you're right!
[12:42:14] <Manusoftar> i missed that
[12:42:36] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if your indentations was cleaner, it wouldn't be so hard to spot
[12:42:44] <doug65536> s/ns/n/
[12:43:18] <Manusoftar> it is on line 23, i'm sorry about the identations, is just that pastebin doesn't seem to like the way Dreamweaver do identations!
[12:44:23] <doug65536> yeah, line 23
[12:47:06] <Manusoftar> fixed identation -> http://pastebin.com/M65uC9xh
[12:48:35] <Manusoftar> still not working :S
[12:56:25] <beardtree> Hey, getting a weird error... "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getComputedStyle' of null" http://jsfiddle.net/VM5QM/
[12:56:39] <beardtree> I'm fairly certain it's related to my cloneTemplate function but I am not sure
[12:59:55] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I'll have a look at real site in debugger if you want
[13:00:28] <doug65536> Manusoftar: PM me if you are hesitant to post url in here
[13:00:59] <Manusoftar> i wont like to abuse of your time but if you could give me some help i'll really appreciate it!!
[13:01:22] <Manusoftar> do you mean to create you an ftp account to acces my site?
[13:01:49] <doug65536> Manusoftar: no, i mean just a url that a normal person would use to look at your page
[13:05:24] <Manusoftar> www.smon.com.ar
[13:07:31] <doug65536> Manusoftar: works for me. I don't see you touch mbox though
[13:09:20] <Manusoftar> damn it isn't working for me, i'll try chrome
[13:09:41] <doug65536> Manusoftar: what are you expecting?
[13:10:42] <Manusoftar> to see something on the console since i've being using console.log and to see those alert() i also use!
[13:10:44] <Manusoftar> used*
[13:12:11] <sunbeam> Is there a way with javascript to record the voice of someone that browses a website (after he gives permission) ?
[13:12:16] <sunbeam> HTML5 way with Flash fallback
[13:13:37] <Manusoftar> i've found some errors on chrome that somehow firefox hasen't detected -> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.smon.com.ar/php/query.php?T=0&V=manusoftar. Origin http://smon.com.ar is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. signup.htm:1
[13:13:38] <Manusoftar> GET http://smon.com.ar/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map 404 (Not Found) js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map:1
[13:27:29] <Manusoftar> doug65536: it seems like it wont be able to reach the div even dough i passed it as a param, perhaps it's not using params by ref
[13:27:31] <Manusoftar> ??
[13:34:33] <doug65536> Manusoftar: objects are by ref whether you want to or not
[13:35:09] <doug65536> Manusoftar: there's no way to tell js "I want to pass by reference". it passes objects by reference always
[13:36:07] <Manusoftar> if you check my site you'll find that it claims that the mbox param is undefined! thats why i thought maybe it wasn't passing params by ref
[13:36:41] <doug65536> no, mbox.style is
[13:37:17] <doug65536> Manusoftar: stop directly using DOM properties
[13:37:22] <Manusoftar> i was just thinking that, since i got that from jquey, then my mistake was to use it like it was straight DOM
[13:37:23] <doug65536> Manusoftar: that isn't a DOM object
[13:38:00] <doug65536> Manusoftar: jquery has .css to read/write styles, .attr to read/write attributes, .val to get set form values,
[13:38:06] <Manusoftar> now, should i access it like $(mbox) or just mbox
[13:38:54] <doug65536> it is already a jquery object. but if mbox was a raw dom object, then yes
[13:39:24] <Manusoftar> so mbox.val("whatever i want it to say"); should work?
[13:40:24] <doug65536> val is for form objects, like <input>
[13:40:33] <doug65536> to change the text content use .text("whatever");
[13:40:38] <Manusoftar> yes but mbox is a div
[13:40:45] <doug65536> then use .text
[13:40:54] <Manusoftar> so mbox.text("whatever");
[13:40:57] <doug65536> yes
[13:41:19] <Manusoftar> and mbox.css("visibility:visible"); ?
[13:41:24] <doug65536> no
[13:41:32] <doug65536> .css("visibility", "visible")
[13:41:33] <doug65536> but
[13:41:40] <doug65536> there are .hide() and .show()
[13:41:46] <doug65536> that you really should have been using
[13:41:51] <Manusoftar> ok
[13:41:54] <Manusoftar> i will
[13:42:14] <doug65536> it's not the exact same thing as visibility though. but for what you're doing it is probably better to use .hide() and .show()
[13:42:37] <doug65536> Manusoftar: an "invisible" thing still takes up space. a .hide() thing doesn't
[13:43:00] <Manusoftar> anyway, since every object is on a table it should not modify how the page looks
[13:43:12] <doug65536> right
[13:43:55] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you can do super-easy animations too with things like .fadeIn() .fadeOut() instead of hide/show... also, .slideDown/.slideUp
[13:44:20] <Manusoftar> but if i already have made the div "invisible" perhaps i should make it "visible" and hide it instead?
[13:44:30] <doug65536> don't make it invisible
[13:44:32] <doug65536> hide it
[13:44:35] <Manusoftar> right
[13:45:03] <doug65536> but yes if you actually wanted it taking up space and you used visibility, the answer is yes,
[13:45:49] <javalover> I think I know the answer to this one
[13:45:58] <javalover> but is it possible to override your existing window.scroll bind?
[13:46:11] <doug65536> javalover: off
[13:46:19] <javalover> like If my code runs that twice, will it remove it?
[13:46:20] <boytoy_> Did you know Bez is a small plugin which lets you specify jQuery easing functions as cubic-bezier co-ordinates? https://github.com/rdallasgray/bez
[13:46:41] <boytoy_> Great for animations!
[13:46:48] <javalover> say i have window.scroll(//do nothing) and I run this after my new function is created
[13:46:54] <javalover> will that override the function I just made?
[13:46:58] <doug65536> javalover: no
[13:47:08] <javalover> hmm well something is causing this bug
[13:47:23] <javalover> what about if I hide the scrollbar will that remove it?
[13:47:25] <javalover> something is removing this
[13:47:26] <doug65536> javalover: window.off('scroll').on('scroll', function() ...)
[13:47:32] <doug65536> is probably what you want
[13:47:42] <javalover> well doug i'm asking because
[13:47:54] <javalover> i have a scroll function that is stopping after I run a function which removes scrollbars
[13:48:03] <doug65536> javalover: there are more ways to scroll than scrollbars
[13:48:21] <javalover> but why would it just stop?
[13:48:23] <javalover> makes no sense
[13:48:54] <doug65536> javalover: only scrolls caused by the user will fire scroll
[13:49:08] <javalover> yes but like
[13:49:20] <javalover> for whatever reason, i gotta look over the fucntion but
[13:49:33] <javalover> I know the function interacts with the scrollbar & removes it
[13:49:42] <javalover> then it replaces it back, and my window.scroll is gone afterwards
[13:49:51] <doug65536> javalover: forget the scrollbar. what is the problem
[13:50:03] <javalover> I have a function, window.scroll  which works fine
[13:50:12] <javalover> but then I open a picture & i remove scrollbars during this
[13:50:25] <javalover> and when I go back to my feed, the endless scroll is gone
[13:50:41] <javalover> like the scrollbar is back but when I scroll to bottom nothing happenhs
[13:52:59] <javalover> hmm I do have this in my code window.scrollTo
[13:53:10] <javalover> but that's supposed to reset it's position
[13:55:32] <doug65536> what do you mean "back" to your feed
[13:55:58] <Manusoftar> doug65536: this is my latest attempt but it's still not working, the div doesn't become visible (or shown in this case) and also if you check the div through firebug you can see it has no text on it??
[13:56:22] <javalover> wait doug
[13:56:23] <javalover> .unbind
[13:56:32] <javalover> if I call window.unbind('scroll') would that remove it?
[13:56:53] <doug65536> javalover: I told you a long time ago. .off
[13:57:00] <javalover> but I don't call that...
[13:57:03] <javalover> i'm just trying to debug this
[13:57:13] <doug65536> you .unbind it?
[13:58:08] <doug65536> Manusoftar: works for me: El nombre de usuario igresado ya estÃ¡ registrado, o bien dejÃ³ el campo vacÃ­o.
[13:58:30] <javalover> yeah I had that set
[13:58:45] <javalover> so imma see i slashed it //
[13:59:03] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ok I see... 1 sec
[13:59:12] <javalover> yup that was the problem
[13:59:15] <javalover> i was calling unbind
[13:59:48] <javalover> is it possible to store my existing function in a variable & rebind it after I unbind?
[14:00:04] <doug65536> Manusoftar: mbox is huge
[14:00:48] <doug65536> Manusoftar: wait sorry, ignore that
[14:02:56] <doug65536> Manusoftar: seriously? why is the page a pile of frames
[14:03:33] <doug65536> Manusoftar: makes debugging harder
[14:04:21] <doug65536> Manusoftar: makes everything harder
[14:05:04] <Manusoftar> i know it was a thign of design an performance, i dont like when you have a menu and all that stuff and you change from one page to another to have to load everything again so i preffer to have a frameset with the main title and a menu bar at left frame. Everything else happens on the mainFrame
[14:05:48] <Manusoftar> and perhaps i may have used a div instead of that iframe but i wasn't pretty sure if it would work so i took the safe way
[14:06:29] <doug65536> Manusoftar: this supposed "safe" way creates a disaster when you want to access things on the page - because there is no "the page" it's a whole bunch of different pages
[14:06:43] <Manusoftar> i know
[14:06:49] <Manusoftar> i'm sorry about that
[14:08:38] <doug65536> Manusoftar: it works
[14:08:42] <doug65536> Manusoftar: what is wrong
[14:10:15] <Manusoftar> now i realized i made a mistake on the if (inside the ajax function) the values were wrong, the php will return a 1 whenever the username is available instead of 0!!
[14:10:27] <Manusoftar> i feel like an idiot right now :P
[14:10:38] <doug65536> Manusoftar: I can't read that language... I have no idea what anything means
[14:11:04] <doug65536> and enabling auto-translate causes debugging problems so I don't enable it
[14:11:20] <Manusoftar> thats ok, it works now!!! thanks
[14:11:29] <doug65536> yw
[14:11:31] <Manusoftar> you mean SPANISH
[14:11:44] <doug65536> I figured it was spanish but it was a guess
[14:12:42] <Manusoftar> well, the domain is a .com.ar meaning it is from Argentina and the local language in Argentina is spanish
[14:13:06] <doug65536> I'm sure all that is completely obvious to you
[14:13:32] <Manusoftar> no offenses
[14:13:48] <Manusoftar> by the way, are you from US?
[14:13:53] <doug65536> canada
[14:13:57] <Manusoftar> oh!
[14:14:05] <Manusoftar> nice place, beautiful!
[14:14:12] <doug65536> yes :)
[14:14:37] <Manusoftar> i never have the choice to be there, perhaps some day i may get some hollidays there!
[14:14:49] <javalover> doug, how can I access the function I bound to the window?
[14:15:06] <doug65536> javalover: what do you mean by "access"
[14:15:09] <javalover> I want to be able to go like var mywindowfunc = $(window).bound
[14:15:17] <Manusoftar> now i have to find out why a simple mysql query would take up to 5 secs!!!
[14:15:31] <javalover> and then I can go $(window).unbind();  and after i'm done $(window).bind(mywindowfunc);
[14:15:46] <doug65536> Manusoftar: yes, mysql is typically about as close to instant as you can get for small tables in my experience
[14:16:34] <javalover> theres no like getBoundFunction? or anything like that?
[14:16:37] <Manusoftar> and the server i'm using use to be pretty fast
[14:16:38] <doug65536> javalover: don't use anonymous function. make a real function (right there) and put the name in place of function() ...  then you can unbind that
[14:16:38] <javalover> getScroll() or something?
[14:16:46] <doug65536> javalover: why not .off
[14:16:48] <javalover> oh
[14:16:53] <javalover> i could use .off
[14:16:57] <javalover> i'm just this code is a year old
[14:17:03] <javalover> so i have stuff I developed a long time ago i'm debugging
[14:17:29] <doug65536> .off()    <-- wipes all event handlers
[14:17:31] <javalover> my goal was to see if it was possible, now my goal is to make it efficient
[14:17:39] <doug65536> .off('eventname')   <-- wipes all for that event
[14:17:47] <javalover> ic
[14:17:55] <doug65536> .off('eventname', functionreference)   <--- wipes one exact callback
[14:18:30] <javalover> so is that the only way then? to just label my handler first?
[14:18:51] <doug65536> javalover: if you want to preserve other handlers for that event, yes
[14:18:54] <Manusoftar> is there any php specific channel on this server that you know?
[14:19:01] <doug65536> Manusoftar: #php
[14:19:14] <javalover> kk cool thx
[14:19:24] <Manusoftar> damn it says that i cannot join because it's being set as invite only!
[14:19:28] <doug65536> Manusoftar: they are a lot less nice over there
[14:19:50] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ##php
[14:19:54] <Manusoftar> yeah but i wouldn't like to discuss php here, i don't want to create a mess
[14:20:13] <Manusoftar> this channel is supossed to discuss jquery so...
[14:20:24] <doug65536> Manusoftar: double hash one is open
[14:20:41] <tw2113> ##php is for people who hav their IRC nicks recognized by nickserv
[14:21:06] <Manusoftar> i have my nick registered i always have to use nickserv identify
[14:21:12] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if ##php doesn't work you need to identify
[14:21:33] <Manusoftar> but it still says i cannot join ##php
[14:22:11] <doug65536> Manusoftar: try to say something in #c++ if that doesn't work, you aren't identified
[14:22:12] <Manusoftar> ok it worked, i seamed like i didn't identify this time
[14:23:25] <Manusoftar> doug65536: is it you the doug65536 on ##php?
[14:23:38] <doug65536> yes
[14:24:01] <Manusoftar> nice, i'll talk to you there..
[14:32:36] <beardtree> Is there a good way to get the values a form will submit as an object?
[14:32:44] <beardtree> Like $('#form').serialize() except as an object instead of string
[14:52:14] <shoky> beardtree: there's .serializeArray()
[15:21:57] <beardtree> shoky: thanks
[15:40:41] <Gmac_> iv never used ajax beforeâ€¦ so can i grab a whole div from another page on my site and show it on another page?
[15:50:46] <grafi> basically
[16:44:37] <Foxhoundz> Sounds too specialized
[16:44:43] <Foxhoundz> it shouldn't be too hard to create it yourself
[16:45:55] <maslo> hi guys I was just wondering if anyone knew of a plugin that would execute an event if you scroll past a certain anchor? or if it could be possible to make :X I know you can do it by checking the position of $(document).scrollTop(); but the content scale dynamically so I don't think I'll be able to use an actual height to launch the event
[16:49:49] <grafi>   i bet there's tons of those kind of plugins
[16:54:40] <panikkos> guys i would like on form submission to auto scroll up how can i achieve this?
[16:55:04] <raj> should I use an overlay/lightbox-type plugin or just jquery-ui to display images?
[16:55:53] <panikkos> I am using <script type="text/javascript">     $(document).ready(function () {         window.scrollTo(0,0);     }); </script>   in my head tags but is not working
[16:55:56] <raj> for a darkened background outside an image
[16:55:59] <panikkos> any ideas?
[16:56:55] <grafi> $(window).scrollTo maybe?
[16:59:03] <panikkos> grafi: you mean that the code i am using is not correct ?
[16:59:31] <grafi> you tell me
[16:59:39] <grafi> any errors in the console?
[17:00:16] <panikkos> grafi: no errors. but no scroll up..
[17:00:59] <grafi> also you're not waiting until the form is submitted ...
[17:01:17] <grafi> you just scroll when document ready is fired?
[17:01:48] <panikkos> Upon submission the page remains in the middle. I would like the page to auto scroll up upon submission.
[17:02:19] <grafi> so you submit via ajax?
[17:02:45] <panikkos> I submit via  <form action="send.php" method="post" class="uniForm" enctype="multipart/form-data"">
[17:03:24] <panikkos> send.php has some variables and the mail attribute
[17:04:24] <panikkos> I am also using iframe in order to link this form with joomla
[17:04:41] <grafi> so the form is inside an iframe?
[17:05:00] <grafi> but you want the "outer" page to scroll up?
[17:05:22] <panikkos> my iframe is as follows <p><iframe id="orderform" src="form.html" width="940" height="1980" style="margin-top: -25px;" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
[17:05:45] <panikkos> grafi yes I want when processing send.php to auto scroll upo
[17:05:46] <raj> how can I get a darkening of the page background when I use jqui's dialog?
[17:05:54] <raj> an "overlay"
[17:07:38] <grafi> raj try reading the docs? http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal
[17:08:04] <grafi> panikkos dont know about that ... but an iframe is definately not making things easier
[17:09:16] <panikkos> grafi: I am thinking to add an onload event to the iframe
[17:09:34] <grafi> good luck
[17:28:28] <Dexx1_> Hey guys, I have a jquery issue.... first of all, on my wordpress site, I see a : " /> on the very top of the page! also, on the developer tools on chrome i see: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined -- any tips?
[17:39:59] <Aric_> Within an $.each loop I am using $(this).replaceWith and it's not replacing? suggestions?
[17:41:08] <panikkos> Guys in my head tags I have "<script language="javascript">  function scrolltotop() {  scroll(0,0);  }  </script>" . In my iframe tag I have "<iframe name="iframe" onload="scrolltotop()">" . I really Cant understand why it doesnt work. Please advice...
[17:42:53] <grafi> Aric_ replaceWith what?
[17:43:22] <Aric_> http://pastie.org/8309536
[17:45:27] <grafi> and what is str ?
[17:45:48] <Aric_> str is my markdown code
[17:46:09] <Aric_> I forgot a ; but just added it and still no go
[17:46:25] <grafi> have you tried logging the collection you each over?
[17:46:36] <Aric_> yes with console.log
[17:46:40] <grafi> or logging inside the each to see if it actually runs?
[17:46:47] <Aric_> yes it does
[17:46:52] <Aric_> ref spits out perfectly
[17:46:58] <Aric_> the ref var that is added at the end
[17:47:20] <Aric_> and i have used console log and seen it execute but the <ref>?</ref> in str never gets replaced with the <a>
[17:47:24] <grafi> and $(this, str) does also return something?
[17:48:44] <Aric_> yes it does: [ref, context: ref, constructor: function, init: function, selector: "", jquery: "1.8.2"?]
[17:48:47] <Aric_> an object
[17:50:22] <grafi> curios
[17:52:09] <Aric_> actually i'm never setting str again hmm
[17:53:22] <Aric_> hmmm
[17:54:16] <Aric_> I want to manipulate my str before outputting it but default actions of jQuery are working on the DOM
[17:54:25] <Aric_> is this possible to edit the string directly with replaceWith?
[17:54:48] <grafi> dont know
[18:09:42] <Aric_> I just did: http://pastie.org/8309567
[18:10:14] <Aric_> works since .each will do it in order and str.replace will do only first occurrence in loop even if you had exact same contents in the <ref> tag
[18:18:22] <grafi> cool
[18:31:48] <Dexx1_> Hey guys, I have a jquery issue.... first of all, on my wordpress site, I see a : " /> on the very top of the page! also, on the developer tools on chrome i see: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined -- any tips?

[19:43:41] <stephenmac7> Hello, I'm having a terrible amount of warnings from firefox concerning jquery: [22:41:47.110] Empty string passed to getElementById().
[19:44:12] <stephenmac7> It does seem that in fact, there is an empty string being passed but I don't know why.
[19:46:49] <stephenmac7> This line: elem = document.getElementById( match[2] ); is the isse
[19:46:51] <stephenmac7> *issue
[19:48:21] <JimmyXander> is this in your jquery.js?
[19:48:26] <JimmyXander> or is this code you wrote?
[19:48:39] <stephenmac7> JimmyXander: In jquery.js
[19:48:50] <JimmyXander> try downloading a new one?
[19:48:57] <stephenmac7> However, it seems to be a bootstrap issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/5223
[19:48:57] <b-ot> stephenmac7: Pull request #5223 by atotic (11mon 2w ago): Fix jquery 1.8.1 warning
[19:51:11] <grafi> so ignore it?
[19:52:03] <stephenmac7> grafi: Guess I'm going to have to. Only figured it out after I asked the question
[19:57:53] <raj> how do I get jquery-ui dialog not to put width:auto on the content I'm turning into a dialog
[20:17:57] <javalover> super confused, I can get the event with $._data(window, "events")
[20:18:14] <javalover> but how do I rebind it after I unbind?  asking cuz I want to unbind an event temporarily & then rebind it
[20:25:41] <JimmyXander> duct tape
[20:29:43] <javalover> lol
[20:30:28] <raj> what could make it so drag doesn't trigger mouseup but click does?
[20:33:13] <raj> actually a drag left doesn't trigger it, but a drag right does
[20:33:48] <raj> i also have a drag selector plugin, not sure how that interferes
[20:44:46] <pranavrc> I need to use a plugin that requires a download, but I don't want to use a separate js file for it. It's a fairly small plugin, so is it ok to copy the code into my file and write the credits for it?
[20:45:36] <Phlow> I don't think there's a problem with that.. most bundlers do that anyway
[20:45:50] <Phlow> I'm not a lawyer
[20:46:18] <Phlow> probably depends on their license
[20:50:12] <pranavrc> Phlow, alright thanks. It seems to be dual-licensed under MIT and GPL2.
[20:56:01] <Phlow> Sounds like GPL2, with MIT parts in it
[20:56:30] <Phlow> MIT alone would be great.  Gotta watch out for GPL2 though
[20:57:02] <pranavrc> oh
[20:57:38] <pranavrc> alright, let me ask this another way. Is it possible to style a scrollbar across all browsers without a jquery plugin?
[20:59:16] <Phlow> Anything's possible, you'd just have to do it yourself
[21:00:39] <pranavrc> alright, thanks
[21:00:43] <Phlow> what's the plugin with the dual license?
[21:01:43] <pranavrc> http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[21:04:11] <Phlow> ah, dual license means you get to pick which one you want
[21:06:21] <javalover> lol
[21:06:53] <pranavrc> Phlow, great, thanks
[21:07:08] <Phlow> since you can't use MIT from with GPL, they add the GPL option
[21:07:29] <Phlow> you can use GPL from within MIT
[21:08:30] <Phlow> sorry, backwards
[21:08:59] <Phlow> you can't use GPL'd from within MIT'd, you can use MIT'd from within GPL'd
[21:09:24] <pranavrc> Phlow, so I can just copy the code into mine, and include the credit and the MIT license with it?
[21:10:43] <Phlow> Yeah
[21:10:49] <Phlow> (my intepretation)
[21:11:59] <pranavrc> Phlow, great. One last question. I havent dealt with bundling before, so the way this works is that in the minified file, i bundle the plugin's code too, while in the non-minified file, I assume that the user has downloaded and imported the file?
[21:12:19] <pranavrc> or do I include the code in the non-minified file too?
[21:12:48] <Phlow> the bundling doesn't have to be minified
[21:13:20] <pranavrc> ah, alright then. Thanks for your help!
[21:15:52] <Phlow> minifier have ways of letting you keep certain comments.
[23:01:08] <pzuraq> so I'm using select2 and I'm getting a really strange little glitch
[23:01:10] <pzuraq> sfor
[23:01:55] <pzuraq> for some reason, the widths of 2 elements aren't matching up
[23:02:41] <pzuraq> weirdly enough, by the inspector it shows they do in fact have the same width
[23:04:37] <pzuraq> one element is set based on the width of the other using outerWidth, and that element is has a percentage based width. could it be a rounding error?
[23:08:53] <Phlow> goddamn IE 9
[23:09:17] <Phlow> I don't get paid enough to make shit work on these defective ass browsers
[23:09:50] <pzuraq> ^^
[23:15:15] <sammych> test
[23:15:49] <sammych> it's not possible to (using CSS) to select a series of blocks using nth-child?
[23:16:22] <sammych> [x][x][ ][ ][x][x][ ][ ][x][x] etc
[23:16:46] <sammych> oh wait, I just have to use multiple rules
[23:16:50] <sammych> duh
[23:17:37] <Cork> sammych: it's often better if you can use classes to solve taht
[23:18:13] <sammych> but it's a fat table
[23:18:24] <sammych> but yeah, I had considered it
[23:19:20] <sammych> if all else fails, I'll resort
[23:20:07] <sammych> yeah, I used the wrong multiplier for n, so all good now
[23:21:38] <raj> I have 2 elements in a container. I want 1 of the elements to take up 100% of width remaining after taking account the 2nd object
[23:21:41] <raj> how can I do that?
[23:21:57] <Cork> cross browser - you can't
[23:22:11] <raj> oops, meant that for #css
[23:22:15] <Cork> in the latest, check flex
[23:22:20] <raj> it's really not possible?
[23:22:24] <Cork> ?g mdn flex
[23:22:25] <b-ot> Cork: flex - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex
[23:22:33] <Cork> raj: not in ie9 and older
[23:22:38] <raj> wow
[23:22:52] <Cork> or fairly new firefox
[23:23:16] <Cork> raj: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex#Browser_compatibility
[23:23:47] <raj> gotcha
[23:23:57] <Cork> so safari and iphone is out too
[23:25:07] <Cork> raj: the closest you can get without flex is have one element 100%
[23:25:23] <Cork> and then overlaying that element with a fixed element with a specific width
[23:31:07] <raj> Cork, exactly what I was attempting to change my design from :)
[23:38:17] <Cork> raj: ya, i know the problem
[23:38:23] <Cork> i've been fighting with it a lot
[23:38:49] <Cork> raj: i even wrote a script that emulates flex for browsers that doens't support it
[23:38:59] <Cork> buggy as hell, but for the project it was a must
[23:39:33] <sammych> okay, I must be missing something here: I've got delegates for click.classCollapsible -> expand collapsible. Inside div.classCollapsible there's another deletegate for click.classCollapsible input. I put a stopPropagation() inside the latter delegate, but it always fires the collapsible
[23:39:48] <peepsalot> does resize event only work on the window?   i have a div set to 100% width,height, but resize doesn't seem to be firing when i scale the window
[23:39:51] <sammych> sorry, that came out more convuluted than I wanted
[23:40:10] <Cork> sammych: please show the html structure in a fiddle instead of explaining it
[23:40:19] <sammych> yeah
[23:40:35] <Cork> peepsalot: ya, it only works on window, or if js fake creates the event
[23:40:53] <Cork> (as ex. jquery ui dialog does when you resize the dialog from js)
[23:42:34] <dwarder> is it possible to use etag with jsonp?
[23:42:59] <Cork> etag?
[23:43:13] <dwarder> http 1.1. directive
[23:43:13] <Cork> you mean the http header?
[23:43:17] <dwarder> yep
[23:43:20] <Cork> no
[23:43:26] <Cork> jsop uses <script> tags
[23:43:36] <dwarder> Cork: so, caching is imposible with jsonp
[23:43:38] <dwarder> right?
[23:43:45] <Cork> it is up to the server
[23:43:59] <Cork> you can't control it from client side is what i meant
[23:44:11] <dwarder> Cork: i have control over the server and the client
[23:44:24] <dwarder> Cork: can i use etag technology with jsonp?
[23:44:35] <Cork> dwarder: are you doing jsonp through $.ajax?
[23:44:48] <dwarder> Cork: i plan to
[23:45:02] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { cache: true })
[23:45:02] <sammych> Cork: yeah, I was trying to stopProp on a 'change' delegate, which is why it was still bubbling. I added stopProp just for 'click' and it's all good now
[23:45:27] <dwarder> Cork: yes, but what if content changes?
[23:45:40] <Cork> dwarder: that is up to the browser
[23:45:55] <Cork> dwarder: cache: true, just means jquery won't add a timestamp to the end of the request
[23:46:10] <Cork> so if it is loaded from cache or not is up to the browser
[23:46:23] <dwarder> Cork: so it is useless?
[23:46:33] <Cork> dwarder: useless?
[23:46:46] <dwarder> Cork: 'cause i need an up to date data, it is possible with etag
[23:46:59] <dwarder> but not with jsonp
[23:47:03] <Cork> dwarder: if the browser cares about etag, etag works
[23:47:06] <Cork> if it dosen't then no
[23:47:10] <dwarder> ohh
[23:47:16] <Cork> dwarder: jsonp is just javascript
[23:47:28] <Cork> so if you can control the cache for a javascript file
[23:47:32] <Cork> you can control it for jsonp
[23:47:42] <dwarder> ohh now i understand
[23:47:46] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[23:47:54] <dwarder> it is all headers ...
[23:48:03] <Cork> cause it is literally doing <script src="url-to-jsonp-javascript-file.js"></script>
[23:48:18] <Technodrome> hey how would you guys implement something like Facebook chat?
[23:48:28] <Cork> Technodrome: websocket
[23:48:38] <Technodrome> an iframe? and having it stay on the same page and update via ajax request is the only way really
[23:48:40] <Technodrome> ?
[23:48:47] <Cork> Technodrome: websocket
[23:48:51] <Technodrome> not talking about that
[23:49:04] <Technodrome> i'm talking just the UI and making sure the chat doesn't refresh when i change a page
[23:49:22] <Cork> uh
[23:49:26] <Technodrome> i'm going to use web sockets yes
[23:49:32] <Cork> you add new elements to the chat as it comes in
[23:49:41] <Cork> and when you get to the end you might want to remove old
[23:50:02] <Technodrome> what do you mean?
[23:50:19] <Technodrome> i'm saying if you go on Facebook, the chat never refreshes no matter where you click
[23:50:22] <Cork> you know how the dom works right?
[23:50:40] <Technodrome> its because the page data is updating via ajax, not a full real request
[23:51:31] <Cork> Technodrome: ya, that is what you use websocket for...
[23:51:40] <Cork> not sure where the problem is...
[23:51:48] <Technodrome> how does the UI have anything to do with web sockets right now
[23:51:57] <Technodrome> i want the chat to never refresh when i click another page
[23:52:06] <Technodrome> i can either use an iframe or use ajax to update page content
[23:52:14] <Technodrome> i was thinking of what the pros and cons of using the iframe are
[23:52:26] <Technodrome> since this software i just can't ajax all the links
[23:52:31] <Cork> Technodrome: websocket gets an onmessage > you create a new element and add the text to the chat list > you check if the chat list has hit the max count and remove the first few if it has
[23:52:45] <Cork> what part is that is not obvious?
[23:53:00] <Technodrome> what? you are talking about the chat protocol, i'm not talking about that at all, purely the UI
[23:53:01] <Cork> if you use websocket i don't get what iframe has to do with it
[23:53:17] <Technodrome> making so the UI of the chat *never* goes away
[23:53:22] <Cork> ?g mdn document.createElement
[23:53:22] <b-ot> Cork: document.createElement - Web API interfaces | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.createElement
[23:53:25] <Technodrome> stays persistent while a user clicks somewhere else
[23:53:29] <Cork> Technodrome: learn about the dom
[23:53:34] <Technodrome> i now the dom
[23:53:37] <Technodrome> know*
[23:53:38] <Technodrome> very well
[23:53:40] <Cork> apperently not...
[23:53:47] <Technodrome> you have no clue at what i'm asking
[23:53:56] <Cork> then you woulnät find this to be an issue at all
[23:54:09] <Cork> Technodrome: you can't to have the message update the page
[23:54:17] <Cork> so update it, i don't get what iframe has to do with it
[23:54:26] <Technodrome> to keep the chat persistent
[23:54:30] <Technodrome> the UI of the thing
[23:54:33] <Cork> persistent?
[23:54:44] <Cork> are you talking about a browser extension or something?
[23:55:03] <Technodrome> http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/400/363/400363928_640.jpg
[23:55:14] <Cork> so?
[23:55:17] <Technodrome> that little chat doesn't won't away when when you click other pages
[23:55:21] <Cork> that's just a div
[23:55:24] <Cork> no need for an iframe
[23:55:35] <Cork> Technodrome: cause they don't do full page reloads
[23:55:43] <Technodrome> omg yes i said that above :)
[23:55:46] <Cork> they just inject the new content in the current page
[23:56:04] <Technodrome> Technodrome: i'm saying if you go on Facebook, the chat never refreshes no matter where you click
[23:56:14] <Technodrome> yes, but this is not an option for this site
[23:56:16] <Cork> sich
[23:56:24] <Technodrome> hence why i was thinking of using an iframe
[23:56:25] <Cork> then you can't use that feature
[23:56:29] <Technodrome> see? :)
[23:56:35] <Cork> iframe would kill the urlbar
[23:56:38] <Technodrome> because some people pull this off with an iframe
[23:56:44] <Cork> not really
[23:56:58] <Cork> what they do is embed the other pages in an iframe
[23:57:00] <Technodrome> it does, hence why i was asking if there was any way to not kill the url bar
[23:57:06] <Cork> and show a static url for the chat
[23:57:16] <Cork> not using iframe is the only way
[23:57:35] <Technodrome> well if iframe is not an option and i can't do ajax updates
[23:57:41] <Technodrome> then i have to use a pop up
[23:58:19] <Technodrome> hence why i was still investigating the iframe situation
