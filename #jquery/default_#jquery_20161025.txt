[04:09:43] <iateadonut> if that is in the file, then how do I add something like this $('body').bind()... using that notation?
[04:09:51] <BrahRah> hi there
[04:10:00] <BrahRah> I want to create a download page
[04:10:19] <BrahRah> but I'm not sure what to use
[04:10:54] <BrahRah> I'll have a lot of files to download
[04:11:13] <BrahRah> So I thought maybe some drop down stuff but I'm not sure
[04:12:04] <BrahRah> any ideas on what plugin I could use?
[04:24:12] <jquery694> If body has all my classes c1-c24 I want to add a class to body ---> https://jsfiddle.net/a899eLz6/3/
[04:25:04] <jquery694> I tested to change 'c1' to 'c999'. But it still show green
[04:25:53] <slax0r> $("body").is(".c1, .c2,....")
[04:26:27] <slax0r> no wait
[04:26:40] <slax0r> $("body.c1.c2.c3.c4......")
[04:26:44] <slax0r> that's the selector you want
[04:27:13] <slax0r> and then just .addClass("done");
[04:27:17] <slax0r> on that selector
[04:27:32] <jquery694> ok, will try =)
[04:28:20] <slax0r> https://jsfiddle.net/a899eLz6/4/
[04:28:31] <slax0r> removed 22 of classes, because they are redundant and not relative for the point
[04:29:34] <jquery694> https://jsfiddle.net/a899eLz6/5/
[04:30:04] <jquery694> mine didnt work and is the same with all the numbers
[04:30:21] <slax0r> you missed c12
[04:30:23] <slax0r> you have onlt c
[04:30:25] <slax0r> only*
[04:30:25] <jquery694> it feels like when I have 1,2,3 and then 11,12,13 it take same
[04:30:49] <slax0r> '.c11.c.c13' see
[04:30:53] <slax0r> in the selector
[04:31:16] <jquery694> oh =)
[04:31:36] <jquery694> now it works =) can I have these numbers in an string ?
[04:32:28] <slax0r> yes, var allDone = '.c1.c2'; and then $('body' + allDone).addClass('done');
[04:33:43] <jquery694> slax0r: thx =)
[04:33:49] <slax0r> yw
[04:34:48] <hollabackatcha> can i ask highcharts question here, anybody with experience highcharts and highmaps ?
[04:35:15] <slax0r> you can try, and if someone knows the answer I'm sure they'll help
[04:37:04] <hollabackatcha> yes, ok
[04:40:18] <hollabackatcha> so .. i have highcharts chart working fine. then i set up highmaps chart... on another page working fine, and now i'm trying to combine both charts on one page. i can get them to work separately, but not together
[04:40:49] <hollabackatcha> here's the code i'm using to get them together .. https://bpaste.net/show/80eb79aaf102
[04:41:09] <hollabackatcha> and the obvious error in console is: Uncaught TypeError: Highcharts.Map is not a function
[04:41:53] <hollabackatcha> but code copied from: http://www.highcharts.com/docs/maps/getting-started ... can't be any easier and simpler than that. (note that when using highcharts, maps are loaded as a module not as a standalone lib)
[07:07:15] <cusco> hello folks
[07:07:31] <cusco> anybody with chrome having troubles openning https://code.jquery.com ?
[07:09:39] <Cork> the cert is wrong
[07:12:12] <cusco> Cork: is it? because other browsers show no problem
[07:14:42] <Cork> cusco: it is what the browser reports
[07:14:49] <Cork> it uses a cn cert for "*.netdna-ssl.com"
[07:15:22] <Cork> btw i've reported it to the infrastructure guys
[07:16:08] <Cork> cusco: simplest solution right now is to just go to http://
[07:16:16] <rollingWolf> Cork, says  CN = code.jquery.com for me
[07:16:22] <cusco> Cork: chrome says problem in chain
[07:16:25] <Cork> rollingWolf: in chromium?
[07:16:28] <rollingWolf> Cork, yes
[07:16:31] <cusco> chrome != chromium
[07:16:35] <rollingWolf> ah, then no
[07:16:46] <cusco> cert is revoked
[07:17:02] <Cork> and fixed
[07:17:07] <Cork> cusco: reload
[07:17:08] <cusco> I think its a issue with my browser and this isn't the place where I should get help
[07:17:18] <cusco> I'm just trying to find if anybody elese is having this
[07:17:31] <cusco> Cork: I did.. same
[07:18:42] <Cork> hmm guess it is a misconfigured node then
[07:18:48] <Cork> cause now it works for me
[07:19:01] <cusco> http://pasteboard.co/jbNbXNbMk.png
[07:19:16] <cusco> windows says its ok, but chrome says its revoked
[07:19:17] <cusco> gah
[07:19:18] <cusco> ok
[07:20:45] <Cork> cusco: you could try restarting the browser
[07:20:56] <Cork> and see if that resets the dns cache and might fix the problem
[07:21:12] <rollingWolf> Cork, tested in chromium too
[07:21:15] <Cork> but ya, it seams like a passed problem
[07:21:19] <rollingWolf> :)
[07:21:21] <Cork> rollingWolf: ya, it isn't browser specific
[07:21:42] <Cork> it is a (a few) cdn nodes with broken config
[07:21:52] <cusco> dns you say?
[07:22:03] <cusco> ok we have a dns cacher, let me refresh that
[07:22:10] <Cork> and by now it is prob just dns caches causing problem
[07:23:38] <cusco> still the same.. its like this since yesterday
[07:24:01] <cusco> im going to uninstall and delete that appdata google stuff and installa gain :|
[07:25:52] <Cork> cusco: a problem might be that google browser tends to not use the local dns servers
[07:26:00] <Cork> and THAT might be why you see different results
[07:26:11] <cusco> hm hmm
[07:26:35] <cusco> If the problem pressists I can make a NAT rule on the router forcing some DNS server
[07:27:07] <cusco> yep its still bad
[07:28:38] <Cork> if you ping code.jquery.com what ip do you get?
[07:28:53] <Cork> (you might be able to find this in chromium somewhere donno)
[07:29:35] <Cork> ah, that is even better
[07:29:46] <Cork> if you open the inspector > network
[07:30:00] <cusco> I can't page doesnt' load, unless I use http instead
[07:30:00] <Cork> then reload code.jquery.com
[07:30:09] <Cork> and then check in headers for code.jquery.com
[07:30:17] <Cork> what does "Remote Address" say?
[07:30:44] <cusco> 94.46.159.28:80
[07:31:04] <Cork> weird...
[07:31:22] <Cork> that's the same node i get and here it works now
[07:32:57] <cusco> yea my system has somwthign wrong :|
[07:33:04] <cusco> ok I'll try to figure it out, thanks
[07:34:06] <fjeels> hey anyone have suggestion on good drag and drop, I'm trying to build page layout, so I'm looking for something that works well with large blocks which I'm not finding
[07:36:58] <cusco> btw, my browser is ignoring all certificates from alphassl
[07:37:01] <cusco> :(
[07:37:06] <cusco> https://www.globalisp.pt/ the same happens
[07:46:08] <cusco> Cork: just to let you know
[07:46:19] <cusco> fixed it, problem with globalsign root ca
[07:46:29] <cusco> cleared cache from windows:
[07:46:31] <cusco> https://support.globalsign.com/customer/portal/articles/1353318-view-and-or-delete-crl-ocsp-cache
[07:46:40] * Cork nods
[07:46:48] <cusco> by running: certutil -urlcache * delete
[07:46:53] <cusco> in the windows command prompt
[08:03:08] <Omar-> hi. Does jQuery Validate interfere with PHP redirect header("Location: foo.com");?
[08:03:53] <Omar-> I was able to redirect server-side. now after adding validate, I have to do it client-side window.href
[08:04:38] <Omar-> I communicate with server via $.ajax
[08:18:48] <AdamPDotty> When Validate prevents calling PHP, that could be called interference.
[08:47:14] <Omar-> AdamPDotty: Now I removed validation, the issue persists. I must be doing something wrong
[08:48:33] <AdamPDotty> We could issue some wild guesses. Maybe CORS-header prevents communication.
[08:56:37] <Omar-> AdamPDotty: I'm redirecting within same domain. location.href works
[08:56:42] <Omar-> header() doesn't
[08:59:56] <AdamPDotty> then fix header() (in a header.php)
[09:02:03] <Omar-> AdamPDotty: you mean and then include it?
[09:02:40] <AdamPDotty> probably rather copy it, but have it work alone first
[09:06:17] <Omar-> AdamPDotty: I'll try it, thanks :)
[09:09:59] <Omar-> AdamPDotty: I created a file with header only and it redirected.
[09:10:01] <Omar-> hmmmm

[09:54:11] <doria> hi guys :) need a bit of help here pls
[09:54:33] <doria> trying to select the first element of this tree in jQuery:
[09:54:46] <doria> html body #stations div #stationsList div.list-group a.list-group-item
[09:55:17] <doria> (as reported by webtools in chrome)
[09:56:09] <doria> this $('#stationsList > .list-group').first() wont work ... bit lost here :S
[09:56:40] <doria> could someone put me out of my misery, pls? lol
[10:05:03] <AdamPDotty> man "wont work"
[10:05:20] <doria> ?
[10:05:29] <imacinto> if `document.readyState === "complete"`, and I don't have any syntax errors in my console, why might this not create an alert? `$(function() { alert("Foo"); });`
[10:06:02] <AdamPDotty> tried .find('>:first-child') instead of .first() ?
[10:06:09] <imacinto> (I am calling that alert function in my console)
[10:06:28] <doria> gonna try that now :P
[10:07:57] <doria> no cigar :P
[10:08:10] <AdamPDotty> no jquery loaded?
[10:08:50] <doria> yes ... it's loaded ;)
[10:09:13] <doria> current line: var $firstEntry = $('#stationsList > .list-group').find('>:first-child');
[10:10:30] <dni-> doria
[10:10:32] <dni-> try
[10:10:35] <doria> yes
[10:10:41] <dni->  $firstEntry = $('#stationsList > .list-group > li ).first(9
[10:10:44] <dni-> first()
[10:10:54] <dni-> if its a li
[10:11:06] <doria> actually it's an 'a'
[10:11:13] <dni-> then replace li with a
[10:11:28] <dni-> or try
[10:11:39] <dni-> $firstEntry = $('#stationsList > .list-group').children().first()
[10:11:42] <dni-> should both work
[10:12:59] <AdamPDotty> also $firstEntry = $('#stationsList').children('.list-group').children().first()
[10:13:27] <dni-> mhm
[10:13:45] <doria> var $firstEntry = $('#stationsList > .list-group > a' ).first();
[10:13:46] <doria> 			
[10:13:48] <doria> 			console.log($firstEntry);
[10:13:49] <doria> 			
[10:13:51] <doria> 			var lat = $firstEntry.data("lat");
[10:13:52] <doria> 			var lon = $firstEntry.data("lon");
[10:13:54] <doria> 			console.log('Latitude ' + lat);
[10:13:55] <doria> that's my code...
[10:14:16] <dni-> looks fine
[10:14:33] <dni-> if its not working you selector is wrong
[10:14:33] <doria> the 'a' has a data attrib of 'lat' ... which always return "undefined" .... also the log doesn't reach to that 'a'
[10:14:45] <Uhkis> jsfiddle.net
[10:14:53] <doria> yes dni... that's exactly my problem ... getting to that selector... eheheh
[10:15:05] <dni-> yeah then whats your html?
[10:15:19] <doria> html body #stations div #stationsList div.list-group a.list-group-item
[10:15:38] <dni-> then triy
[10:15:47] <dni-> $(".list-group-item").first()
[10:15:57] <dni-> ^^
[10:16:01] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[10:16:25] <doria> I have to refer to that ID ... there are other list-group-item in the code ;)
[10:16:29] <doria> #stationsList
[10:16:35] <AdamPDotty> would even work without first, as data takes the first anyway.
[10:16:40] <dni-> $("#stationsList .list-group-item").first()
[10:16:40] <dni-> then
[10:17:06] <dni-> if this isnt working ;)
[10:17:10] <AdamPDotty> I read that .find() is faster than space
[10:17:12] <dni-> you got a typo3 here
[10:17:13] <dni-> stationsList
[10:17:15] <dni-> OR!
[10:17:20] <AdamPDotty> plus it is more obvious
[10:17:24] <dni-> you got a duplicate ID #stationsList
[10:17:38] <dni-> ;D
[10:17:43] <dni-> kinda think thats you problem ;)
[10:17:54] <AdamPDotty> Then again it might be any markup.
[10:18:09] * AdamPDotty inserts "broken"
[10:18:12] <doria> wow must be blind because I can't see any duplicates ... lol
[10:18:23] <AdamPDotty> fiddle it
[10:18:25] <dni-> yep
[10:18:40] <taplar> console.log( $( '[id="stationsList"]' ).length );
[10:20:07] <doria> @taplar: 1
[10:20:35] <AdamPDotty> http://validator.w3.org/ ..
[10:22:08] <dni-> lol
[10:22:34] <dni-> thats not nice ;D
[10:25:08] <AdamPDotty> maybe clicked on the link and crashed
[10:39:55] <imacinto> how does jquery determine if a $(document) is "ready"?
[10:40:29] <taplar> iirc it checks something with the load state or change state or something
[10:40:43] <taplar> take a peak at the source, ;)
[10:40:56] <imacinto> do you have a line number you would recommend?
[10:41:24] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.ready
[10:41:35] <imacinto> $.isReady returns `true`, yet `$(function() { debugger; });` does not launch debugger
[10:41:46] <imacinto> when executed from console
[10:42:26] <taplar> your trying to run the debugger from the console?
[10:43:12] <imacinto> taplar: in that example, yes. it could be console.log() or alert() instead. my code does not execute when called that way though
[10:43:34] <taplar> i dunno that debugger works in that case.  seems like a weird use case
[10:44:15] <imacinto> it does. but if you're more comfortable with `alert("Hello world")`, that doesn't execute either
[10:44:22] <dni-> imacinto
[10:44:28] <dni-> the event is already fired
[10:44:35] <dni-> when you but in in console so it would never fire
[10:45:11] <taplar> not true
[10:45:16] <imacinto> dni-: that's not true, you can try it, and jquery's documentation encourages it (I think)
[10:45:19] <taplar> i just tried it and the debugger jumped up
[10:45:34] <dni-> ok.. :D
[10:45:38] <taplar> ready applies something like a then() on a promise.  it doesn't matter if the ready has resolved or not
[10:45:39] <dni-> wtf ;D that confused me
[10:45:40] <dni-> ^^
[10:45:56] <dni-> hm, ok
[10:46:04] <taplar> so dunno what your doing imacinto, but i just got the debugger to fire from the console
[10:46:32] <imacinto> so I'm trying to troubleshoot why it's not working on my page. I'd create a fiddle but it's on some pages on my company's site
[10:46:46] <taplar> i did it on that james padolsey site
[10:46:52] <taplar> just hit F12 and plug it in
[10:47:18] <dni-> imacinto i once got this problem too that the debugger wont fire
[10:47:29] <taplar> browser?
[10:47:35] <dni-> on my end it had todo with some requirejs
[10:48:52] <imacinto> forget about debugger. imagine it's console.log() or alert() or something. the point is that code wrapped in that event listener is not firing on my page, and I'm wondering what I could try to troubleshoot
[10:49:04] <dni-> maybe
[10:49:14] <taplar> do you get any sort of error?
[10:49:14] <dni-> your jquery gets overwritten? by a other framwork?
[10:49:39] <taplar> what do you get if you console.log( $, jQuery ) ?
[10:49:47] <taplar> they should be the same
[10:49:55] <imacinto> taplar: no error -- console returns [#document]
[10:50:04] <taplar> ok, that's not right
[10:50:08] <taplar> that's not jquery
[10:50:08] <dni-> :)
[10:50:18] <imacinto> and `$ === jQuery` returns true
[10:50:51] <taplar> console.log( jQuery.fn.jquery );
[10:51:05] <imacinto> "1.7.1"
[10:51:10] <taplar> console.log( $.fn.jquery );
[10:51:33] <imacinto> "1.7.1"
[10:51:36] <taplar> wtf
[10:52:09] <taplar> so yeah, it should work
[10:52:36] <imacinto> 100% it should :)
[11:43:03] <taplar> so quiet
[12:29:11] <catbadger> silent even.
[12:35:40] <AdamPDotty> hush
[12:36:08] <taplar> lol, queue gwen
[12:40:18] <robertmaxrees> that like qui gon?
[12:47:19] <taplar> eh?
[12:47:53] <taplar> i dun speck non of that chin knees yo
[12:50:08] <robertmaxrees> queue gwne kindasorta sounds like "qui-gon", the dude from star wars
[12:50:17] <rodney77> hello, I have a question about $(this)
[12:50:33] <taplar> lol, gotcha
[12:50:37] <rodney77> If I use $(this), or jQuery(this) in a function, it works fine
[12:50:37] <robertmaxrees> hello rodney77
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[12:50:43] <rodney77> hi robertmaxrees
[12:50:55] <robertmaxrees> let me guess, when you're NOt in a function, $(this) doesn't work?
[12:51:26] <rodney77> yes robertmaxrees, exactly. so i'm wondering if there's an equivalent when i'm just writing a one-liner
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what you're writing.
[12:51:44] <rodney77> ok, this is my one-liner: jQuery('#first_name').attr('size', jQuery(this).val().length);
[12:51:50] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' object is often set by a calling function.
[12:51:53] <rodney77> yeah
[12:51:55] <robertmaxrees> and in that case, it doesn't work like that.
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to explicitly pass $('#first_name') again.
[12:53:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest saving it to a var and maybe even storing other things in vars, too.
[12:53:21] <rodney77> i see. is there a way for a field to trigger a function just by loading? Something like jQuery('input[type="text"]').load() or maybe blur(), assuming it's blurred on load?
[12:53:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:54:05] <robertmaxrees> are you loading those fields in via ajax?
[12:54:09] <rodney77> no
[12:54:21] <robertmaxrees> are you writing them into the page after pageload?
[12:54:54] <rodney77> no. they are marked up into the page. I just want jquery to take all the fields on the page and shorten them to their values
[12:55:02] <rodney77> they are pre-populated with values
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> then do it on document ready.
[12:58:06] <taplar> you mean your trying to shorten down text inputs to just the text inputed?
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> heh.,
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> something tells me he's trying to cleverly set a size limit on the inputs.
[12:58:31] <taplar> if you don't have a css style on those to make them monospace, your going to have issues.  may still have issues
[12:58:40] <rodney77> taplar, correct. I have a function that will do this when you type and it works fine
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> why are you dynamically changing size like that?
[12:59:04] <rodney77> well, the form i an creating is kind of a madlib form
[12:59:20] <rodney77> imagine a paragraph where you fill in the blanks
[12:59:40] <rodney77> it reads better when there isn't extra space after the word
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:00:50] <rodney77> and jQuery('input[type="text"]').bind('keyup', function () { works fine
[13:00:58] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to use .input fwiw.
[13:01:07] <robertmaxrees> err. .on('input',
[13:01:43] <rodney77> so i'm just trying to initialize setting the lengths on page load, without having to name every field id explicitly
[13:01:52] <robertmaxrees> give 'em a class.
[13:01:55] <taplar> classes are awesome
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> you use .find() in a container.
[13:02:00] <robertmaxrees> and .each(_
[13:02:03] <robertmaxrees> *.each()
[13:02:06] <rodney77> hmm
[13:02:13] <rodney77> yeah find() might work
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> but you'll still need .each()
[13:02:24] <rodney77> ok
[13:02:28] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's there for.
[13:02:30] <rodney77> well that is great advice. thank you
[13:02:39] <rodney77> I will give it a shot and let you know how it goes
[13:05:34] <jquery673> Hey there, I'm trying to make an accordion in jquery, but when I use data rel to reference each part,. it isn't adding my "active class"? Any Ideas? here is my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/z871ppxy/1/
[13:08:29] <taplar> your putting the rel on the content
[13:08:38] <taplar> your trying to get the rel off of the section
[13:09:28] <taplar> ln 5 and 9, switch rel and id and works
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> also, favor .prop for .attr
[13:11:27] <jquery673> *facepalm*   also, whats the difference with prop and attr?
[13:11:28] <taplar> or don't even wrap in jQuery there
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:11:34] <taplar> this.id and this.rel should work
[13:11:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:12:05] <robertmaxrees> as a gross oversimplification, .prop uses the actual dom node.  .attr interfaces with the markup
[13:12:26] <rodney77> robertmaxrees, it worked perfectly
[13:12:31] <rodney77> i didn't even need find()
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> rodney77 what'd you do instead?
[13:13:01] <rodney77> $('input[type="text"]').each(function() { $(this).attr('size', Math.max(1,$(this).val().length) );});
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah so you'll want to use .prop there
[13:13:17] <taplar> this.value.length
[13:13:20] <robertmaxrees> and use a class anyway.
[13:13:29] <taplar> this.size
[13:13:31] <taplar> -_-
[13:13:33] <taplar> lol
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:13:42] <robertmaxrees> and selecting on attributes is kind of a gross thing to do.
[13:14:58] <jquery103> Hey sorry I missed your message, my comp just blue screened ~_~
[13:15:05] <robertmaxrees> that's fun
[13:15:16] <taplar> you got rel and id backwards
[13:15:26] <taplar> on your assignment part
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> and either use prop or access the properties directly
[13:16:06] <jquery103> Yeah i saw the id and rel part, I was curious about why using prop over attr?
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> as a gross oversimplification because you want to modify the DOM, not the markup
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> but you can access those properties directly anyway.
[13:17:09] <taplar> ^much better especially in a loop
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> why would you say it's better?
[13:17:36] <taplar> no new jQuery created, less GC
[13:17:37] <jquery103> Ah i see
[13:17:47] <robertmaxrees> the perf hit should be minimalk
[13:18:09] <taplar> i've been in perf world for the past month or so.  just my state of mind right now, :)
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> hahaha that's right.
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> really depends for me on consistency tbh.
[13:20:59] <jquery103> Awesome, thanks for the help you two! appreciate it :)
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[13:24:17] <taplar> i did get them to do the compression change though, :D
[13:29:20] <robertmaxrees> noice
[13:30:28] <taplar> wasn't as bad as i thought it was.  apparently on a non development box it was already compressing js and css with the grails asset pipeline
[13:30:32] <taplar> but html was being left out
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> it's surprising how hefty markup can be.
[13:32:11] <taplar> oh yeah
[13:36:01] <new_to_json> Is tap in here?
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> ;p;
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[13:36:22] <taplar> the event?
[13:36:33] <new_to_json> Hey tap, just wanted to come back and say that I figured out how to get that jeopardy game working for the most part!
[13:36:40] <taplar> awesome
[13:37:19] <sumedhN> awesome
[13:37:23] <robertmaxrees> rad
[13:38:30] <new_to_json> I got all the randomization sorted out this weekend, but now I have a problem pulling the correct data question since it dupes them, I have 2 data-categorys which are unique data-category="0" and data-category="1"
[13:39:24] <new_to_json> But the data-questions dupe like this:  data-question="0-3", is there a way I can tell my click function to pay attention to the parent's data category?
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> you can check a parent element - just use .closest() to select it and then use it like you normally would.
[13:41:24] <new_to_json> so If i have my code like this: http://pastebin.com/BB9EEDCV
[13:41:45] <new_to_json> I would want to do $('.unanswered').closest().click(function(){}  ?
[13:41:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:42:01] <robertmaxrees> inside the click handler.
[13:42:15] <robertmaxrees> function() { $(this).closest('someSelector') ]
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> * }
[13:47:52] <new_to_json> still returning "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '2' of undefined"
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> "still"?
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> were you getting that before?
[13:48:18] <new_to_json> (it only does that ot the 1st categories. No matter how many I have, it will show the last one)
[13:48:20] <new_to_json> yes
[13:48:36] <robertmaxrees> so you'll probably want to fix that first ;)
[13:48:52] <new_to_json> That's what I was trying to do
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> so what line is it failing on?
[13:49:10] <new_to_json> because the questions in the columns get the same data-rel
[13:49:30] <new_to_json> line 26
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees>  $('#question-modal').modal('show');//fire modal ?
[13:49:43] <new_to_json> `var tempvar = x[category][value];1
[13:50:27] <taplar> what is 'x'?
[13:50:43] <taplar> it's kinda hard to follow this snipplet out of the whole context
[13:50:54] <new_to_json> Understandable
[13:51:22] <new_to_json> Here's my full script: http://pastebin.com/0eAexM7F
[13:52:56] <taplar> so x is a multi-dimensional array
[13:53:18] <al_nz1> morning peoples
[13:53:57] <new_to_json> yeah, sorry just saw your post asking about it
[13:54:42] <taplar> ugh, we need to talk about scope yo
[13:54:43] <taplar> lol
[13:55:03] <new_to_json> oh no! the scope talk haha
[13:56:04] <taplar> can you get this working in a fiddle?
[13:56:23] <new_to_json> I'll try 1 sec
[13:56:42] <taplar> you'll most likely have to pull the json returned from the endpoint into the variable and not do the ajax
[13:56:50] <taplar> but it'll make this slightly easier
[13:59:26] <new_to_json> So i have it mostly workjing, not sure how to work with JSON in fiddles htough
[13:59:27] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/
[14:04:25] <taplar> got some parse errors i'm trying to track down
[14:04:44] <hellyeah> yo
[14:06:03] <new_to_json> I have it working in a plunkr, if you want that
[14:06:23] <taplar> more of a jsfiddle dude
[14:06:49] <taplar> ok https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/2/
[14:07:32] <taplar> so a couple things
[14:07:54] <taplar> first, you have a load binding, and two document readies.  there a reason for that?
[14:08:44] <new_to_json> so the window.load() was so that pop up appeared on load
[14:09:25] <new_to_json> Looks like the second one I was using to console log my x array
[14:09:43] <taplar> any reason you couldn't show the modal on ready?
[14:09:56] <new_to_json> Nope, I've just always done it that way haha
[14:11:09] <taplar> you really don't have pictures or any thing here so not sure you need the load.  and consolidation is kewl, :)
[14:11:34] <new_to_json> Alright, I removed that part and the console log :p
[14:12:01] <taplar> update the fiddle?
[14:12:06] <new_to_json> Oh i meant local
[14:12:11] <new_to_json> I'll do it on fiddle
[14:12:42] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/4/
[14:13:37] <taplar> alright so now for the scope thing
[14:13:48] <taplar> take a look at your variables such as x, map, and score
[14:14:14] <taplar> those guys are outside any function
[14:14:44] <taplar> meaning they are global variables and will remain in memory for as long as the user is on the page
[14:15:17] <taplar> typically, unless you have a reason for it, you want to scope those down to a closure or namespace so they are not so global and can potentially be cleaned up
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> it also prevents naming collisions.
[14:16:14] <taplar> ^
[14:16:43] <taplar> easiest one to do, a doc ready will work for that purpose
[14:16:59] <taplar> since you're already using them
[14:18:14] <new_to_json> So I need to move them into a single doc ready?
[14:18:29] <taplar> preferably
[14:18:57] <hellyeah> it is enough to have one doc.ready
[14:19:04] <taplar> yep
[14:19:23] <taplar> unless you have a reason for multiple ones, such as multiple file includes
[14:19:26] <hellyeah> if i am not mistake the thing doc.ready do is to wait all dom loads before executing any js
[14:19:42] <robertmaxrees> "load" is wrong ;)
[14:19:58] <hellyeah> in the past people prefer to ref js file in the end of body
[14:20:05] <taplar> and today
[14:20:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  hmm
[14:20:23] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  what is the correct words?
[14:20:25] <robertmaxrees> "load" = all assets have finished loading.
[14:20:27] <hellyeah> word*
[14:20:27] <taplar> if you can avoid doc ready, always a good thing
[14:20:40] <hellyeah> why it is good thing?
[14:20:52] <taplar> if you don't need it, it's just a little overhead
[14:21:01] <robertmaxrees> why wait to run code?
[14:21:38] <new_to_json> hey sorry, something happened at work, had to run head on it, i'm back though
[14:21:52] <hellyeah> overhead
[14:21:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:22:15] <hellyeah> so you can always put all of your js at the end of body
[14:22:20] <new_to_json> Shouldn't my score be global though? since it always needs accesed?
[14:22:33] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[14:22:36] <taplar> sure, unless you have a reason not to
[14:22:54] <new_to_json> i don't think the score scoping is my issue
[14:23:16] <taplar> new_to_json: if you scope the score to a closure, it will be accessable to everything within that closure
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah https://api.jquery.com/ready/ there's a subtle distinction between network "loaded" and page "loaded"
[14:23:21] <hellyeah> score?
[14:23:22] <taplar> which will be where your logic is
[14:23:25] <hellyeah> what is that?
[14:23:51] <taplar> new_to_json: this may not be your issue, but these are good practices for js development, :)
[14:24:06] <hellyeah> robertmthanks robertmaxrees
[14:24:25] <new_to_json> Which closure would I move it into? the loadBoard function?
[14:24:34] <taplar> the document ready is your top closure
[14:24:45] * hellyeah wonder what score is
[14:24:51] <taplar> it's a variable of his
[14:25:27] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/5/  So like this?
[14:26:03] <taplar> ya, still have you x outside though
[14:26:22] <new_to_json> Ok, moved it on
[14:26:24] <new_to_json> in*
[14:26:48] <hellyeah> wow thats long json
[14:27:01] <taplar> amen fatha
[14:27:04] <hellyeah> why x is outside
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:27:29] <hellyeah> new_to_json:  in jsfiddle document.ready is implemented default
[14:27:38] <new_to_json> hellyeah  because js is hard for me
[14:27:48] <hellyeah> you get used to it
[14:27:51] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah not helpful in this particular case :) trying to teach the dude some basics fwiw.
[14:28:07] <hellyeah> i see
[14:28:18] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> it's fine, dude just needs to start with some basics :)
[14:28:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/7/
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> also: the document ready stuff in jsfiddle doesn't put it in a new function.
[14:28:50] <robertmaxrees> just defers execution.
[14:28:51] <hellyeah> new_to_json:  did you check try.jquery.com
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:59] <hellyeah> :D
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> let taplar do his thing for a few :)
[14:29:14] <taplar> ok, so next, any bindings that your doing or logic, other than function declarations should go in the document ready too
[14:29:33] <new_to_json> Yes, I've had classes and all, I just dont think in programming languages. I work mainly in front end / graphics
[14:29:48] <taplar> and even the function declarations can go too, as per roberts comment about name collision avoidance
[14:29:57] <new_to_json> So like click functions?
[14:30:05] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i amm just excited :)
[14:30:05] <taplar> everything! :D
[14:30:24] <taplar> the document ready is your world.  it encapsulates it all
[14:30:54] <taplar> brb, restroom
[14:31:29] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/8/
[14:32:25] <hellyeah> can i ask a question?
[14:32:33] <robertmaxrees> you just did ;)
[14:32:42] <new_to_json> lol :p
[14:32:46] <hellyeah> if you define variable inside (function(){ it is still global :D
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:33:00] <hellyeah> okey then it is fine :D
[14:33:03] <robertmaxrees> unless you omit the var keyword.
[14:33:07] <robertmaxrees> but you should never do that.
[14:33:11] <hellyeah> i dont want new_to_json cofused
[14:33:56] <hellyeah> well i discovered that if you dont use "var" keyword. Js automatically define the variable as global variable
[14:34:05] <robertmaxrees> which is technically invalid.
[14:34:09] <robertmaxrees> you should never omit the var keyword.
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> or let or const.
[14:34:25] <taplar> 'use strict'; and watch it break, :)
[14:34:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:44] <hellyeah> well i understand let is for local scope, inside the function
[14:34:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:34:59] <robertmaxrees> let is block scoped.
[14:35:04] <new_to_json> Ok taplar, I moved it all in the same function
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> var is function scope.
[14:35:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/9/ commented out the map var in the document ready since we have it outside up top. but normally it would be where you put it
[14:35:34] <hellyeah> you can do var x= function() and const x= function() those are same am i correct?
[14:35:41] <hellyeah> my last question :D
[14:35:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:35:50] <robertmaxrees> not the same at all.
[14:35:56] <robertmaxrees> var is function scoped.
[14:36:00] <robertmaxrees> const/let are block scoped.
[14:36:01] <new_to_json> alright :)
[14:36:29] <robertmaxrees> alright i gotta pack up and head into work.
[14:36:31] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[14:36:43] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  with block scoped you mean it is valid inside particular block of code right?,
[14:36:49] <hellyeah> my last question :D:D
[14:37:04] <taplar> { let x = 3; } console.log( x ); <-- undefined
[14:37:45] <hellyeah> yes
[14:38:06] <taplar> new_to_json: let me see if I can make it do a dummy ajax call for now
[14:38:32] <new_to_json> Alright, just a heads up, I gotta head to a meeting in 30mins, but will be back after that
[14:38:53] <hellyeah> >> { const x = 3} console.log(x); ecmabot> hellyeah: undefined; Console: 3
[14:39:10] <hellyeah> new_to_json:  taplar is good teacher
[14:39:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  btw this code block thing {..} is not cross browser still
[14:40:20] <taplar> right
[14:42:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/10/ ok, so dummy ajax call
[14:42:29] <hellyeah> jsfiddle has good documentation for doing ajax call
[14:43:16] <taplar> so now, question.  where are you using 'map'?
[14:43:27] <hellyeah> i dont understand why json is outside
[14:43:40] <taplar> cause it's super long and i didn't want to move it in for the fiddle, :)
[14:43:46] <hellyeah> :D
[14:44:01] <hellyeah> i heard doing async:false is bad practice
[14:44:03] <taplar> in the real code it wouldn't be there at all
[14:44:09] <taplar> yep, we'll get to that, ;)
[14:44:49] <taplar> or did new_to_json go to his meeting already
[14:45:15] <hellyeah> i really wonder why you have option like that if it is bad practice it is because of some edge cases?
[14:45:34] <taplar> it's from the early days of jQuery implementation
[14:45:48] <new_to_json> any luck on the ajax call?
[14:45:52] <taplar> people were used to non async logic, or that's what some others told me
[14:45:55] <new_to_json> oh shit
[14:46:00] <taplar> new_to_json: yep, look at the latest fiddle
[14:46:01] <hellyeah> check the link taplar shared
[14:46:03] <new_to_json> i do that all the time, for got to scroll
[14:46:44] <hellyeah> new_to_json:  in your original document you should put your json into (function(){
[14:47:02] <hellyeah> or it is not initialized am i correct?
[14:47:05] <taplar> no, he's retrieving it with the ajax call.  it won't be there at all
[14:47:19] <hellyeah> actuallly yes :D
[14:47:21] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:47:25] <hellyeah> yo got from backend
[14:47:27] <taplar> the dummy ajax call here is now emulating that fetch
[14:47:31] <new_to_json> Alright i see it now
[14:49:01] <taplar> so now, where is map used?
[14:49:41] <new_to_json> I used it in my first ajax call
[14:49:59] <taplar> you were taking data and assigning it to map.  but where is map used?
[14:50:24] <new_to_json> in my click function
[14:51:20] <taplar> you're also using it to build the board, right?
[14:51:35] <new_to_json> for the columns
[14:52:30] <taplar> so, the building of the table is already in a function.  the click logic could also be in a method.  if there were so, you could pass in the data to both of those methods, no?
[14:52:56] <new_to_json> yes? i think lol
[14:53:08] <taplar> yep, :)  which will do two things for you
[14:53:16] <new_to_json> scope my vars?
[14:53:39] <taplar> first, it will scope that down even more, to those methods.  you will not need the variable in the closure.  all your methods can reference the argument passed in to them.
[14:53:56] <new_to_json> Sounds good
[14:54:00] <taplar> second, this will allow the ajax to work as intended.
[14:54:27] <taplar> before you were doing "async: false" which should be avoided.  when you perform an ajax call with async false it locks up the browser until the request finishes
[14:54:33] <taplar> which is terrible user experience.
[14:54:48] <new_to_json> I see, alright, probably good to remove that
[14:55:02] <taplar> and the ability to do so was removed in the latest version of jQuery, to show how much it should be avoided, :)
[14:56:31] <new_to_json> well hold that thought, I have my meeting, but I'll be back asap
[14:57:36] <taplar> sure
[14:57:51] <taplar> i may be away knocking out some work stuff, but i'll be browsing
[14:58:07] <new_to_json> Sounds good, thanks!
[16:10:56] <new_to_json> Hey Taplar, sorry my meeting ran late
[16:12:22] <taplar> that's fine
[16:12:34] <new_to_json> Are you still available to help me figure this out?
[16:13:05] <taplar> not a lot but i can try to point out some stuff
[16:13:21] <new_to_json> Alright, I'm all ears!
[16:14:06] <taplar> well first try to change to logic to pass in the data to the two methods for building the table and binding the links
[16:16:15] <new_to_json> What do you mean change the logic?
[16:17:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/11/
[16:17:39] <taplar> so loadBoard is being called when the ajax has gotten the data
[16:18:03] <taplar> change it so that you pass the data to that method to be used.  also move your bind logic into a method that you can also pass the data into.
[16:18:14] <taplar> and call that from the same place as the loadBoard
[16:19:35] <new_to_json> How do I know at what point ajax has finished retriving the data?
[16:20:15] <taplar> that's what that then() is doing
[16:20:30] <taplar> then() takes two arguments, a success callback and a failure callback
[16:20:39] <taplar> we're just giving it the success callback
[16:20:50] <new_to_json> Oh i see
[16:21:38] <new_to_json> So now I have move my bind function into the ajax call?
[16:22:00] <taplar> no, into a method that you call from the ajax call
[16:22:03] <taplar> just like your doing for your loadBoard
[16:22:57] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/12/   like this?
[16:23:29] <new_to_json> oops, type, use this:  https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/13/
[16:23:56] <taplar> yep, now pass in the data to both of those, and make the param those two methods take in be 'map'
[16:24:18] <taplar> then you don't need the var map at the beginning of the document ready
[16:25:40] <new_to_json> So I need to set up : loadBoard(data); and bindAnswer(data);?
[16:25:55] <taplar> yep
[16:25:59] <new_to_json> then map = data/
[16:26:13] <taplar> no you don't have to assign the variable
[16:26:35] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/14/
[16:27:13] <taplar> your missing the parameter on your function definitions
[16:27:46] <new_to_json> of so function bindAnswer(data) { } ?
[16:28:10] <taplar> bindAnswer(map) {}
[16:28:22] <new_to_json> Should I also move my update score and handle answer in there as well?
[16:28:33] <taplar> the variable name you pass to a method does not have to match the name of the parameter on the function definition
[16:28:56] <taplar> what logic uses score and answer?
[16:29:48] <new_to_json> they're seperate functions
[16:30:15] <new_to_json> but not used with loadboard or bindanswer
[16:31:02] <taplar> ok, so where do you get score from?
[16:31:05] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/15/
[16:31:24] <new_to_json> bindAnswer();?
[16:32:18] <taplar> you have multiple score variables.  i'm referring to the one at the start of the document ready
[16:32:50] <new_to_json> oh it's = to 0
[16:33:27] <taplar> initially.  where do you change it?
[16:33:53] <new_to_json> updateScore();
[16:34:14] <taplar> ok, so move that var into there
[16:34:22] <taplar> wait, what?
[16:34:34] <new_to_json> ?
[16:34:35] <taplar> you're not setting the var in there
[16:34:50] <taplar> your using it
[16:34:54] <new_to_json> I set the var in bindAnswer();
[16:35:16] <new_to_json> but I said that and you said it was wrong
[16:35:17] <taplar> that is a different score
[16:35:28] <taplar> it has a var in front of it.  that is a different variable
[16:36:11] <new_to_json> the one at doc ready and the one at bindAnswer both have var =
[16:36:33] <taplar> yep, they are not the same variable
[16:36:53] <new_to_json> so i use it in handleAnswer(); ?
[16:36:59] <taplar> yes
[16:37:02] <taplar> so move it in there
[16:37:24] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/16/
[16:37:51] <taplar> i don't see the move
[16:38:03] <new_to_json> the whole function? or just call it?
[16:38:18] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/17/
[16:38:24] <taplar> the var score from the top of the document ready
[16:38:39] <taplar> no dude
[16:38:45] <taplar> we've been talking about the score variable
[16:38:59] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/18/
[16:39:01] <new_to_json> like that?
[16:39:33] <taplar> yes, now your setting it in that method.  where is it being used?
[16:40:00] <new_to_json> in handleAnswer
[16:40:11] <taplar> that's where your setting it
[16:40:19] <taplar> score = something <-- setting it
[16:40:33] <taplar> blahblahblah.somemethod(score) <-- using it
[16:40:46] <new_to_json> updateScore();
[16:41:03] <taplar> ok.  so now that it is scoped down to handleAnswer, you have to pass it to that method to use it
[16:41:59] <new_to_json> so call updateScore(); within handleAnswer()?
[16:42:11] <taplar> which you already are
[16:42:27] <new_to_json> I see that
[16:42:44] <taplar> yep, so now you just need to give it the score so it can use it
[16:43:24] <new_to_json> How do I give it score?
[16:43:34] <new_to_json> updateScore(score); ?
[16:43:40] <taplar> yep
[16:43:56] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/19/
[16:44:46] <taplar> typo, and you forgot to add it to the function definition
[16:45:19] <new_to_json> i didn't forget... I didn't know lol
[16:45:20] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/20/
[16:45:43] <taplar> any time you pass a variable to a method, you want to put it on the method parameters
[16:46:10] <new_to_json> function handleAnswer is my method right?
[16:46:14] <taplar> no
[16:46:20] <new_to_json> update score is?
[16:46:23] <taplar> yes
[16:46:27] <taplar> that's the one your passing it to
[16:46:32] <new_to_json> so i put score in the wrong function
[16:46:36] <taplar> yep
[16:46:56] <taplar> you understand parameter passing in js, right?
[16:46:57] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/22/
[16:47:29] <new_to_json> I thought I did, but I guess we'll see
[16:47:47] <new_to_json> lol, So anytime I reference it in the function call, it has to be in params of said function?
[16:48:13] <taplar> whenever you want to pass a variable to a function you want to put it in the parameters
[16:48:13] <taplar> function sayMyName(name) { console.log(name); }
[16:48:14] <new_to_json> function myTest (test){ }         myTest(test);
[16:48:19] <taplar> sayMyName('bill')
[16:48:28] <taplar> sayMyName(someVariableWithANameInIt)
[16:48:39] <new_to_json> alright, I think I got it now
[16:48:42] <taplar> k
[16:49:28] <taplar> ok, so we got you scoped down pretty good
[16:50:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/23/   so, what issues do we have?
[16:50:38] <new_to_json> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of undefined
[16:51:02] <new_to_json> oh wait
[16:51:07] <new_to_json> the score doesn't add
[16:51:19] <new_to_json> it just updates
[16:54:58] <taplar> because we're creating it anew each time
[16:55:21] <new_to_json> because my update score function has .empty() ?
[16:55:31] <taplar> so now we have an actual reason to scope it higher
[16:55:47] <taplar> no, we are declaring it as 0 at the start of handleAnswer and it is being cleaned up and recreated every time
[16:56:02] <new_to_json> oh I see
[16:56:08] <taplar> instead of figuring out what it was, we can move it back to the document ready level and we should be good.
[16:56:11] <new_to_json> so move the delaration to the top?
[16:56:37] <taplar> yep.  leave it on the method passing and receiving like you did for good measure, but yeah
[16:57:06] <new_to_json> https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/24/
[17:13:56] <new_to_json> oops small typo, fixed it here: https://jsfiddle.net/5vzzrn33/25/
[17:27:11] <new_to_json> hey taplar, gotta run to the dentist, I'll ping you tomorrow, have a good night!
[17:27:37] <taplar> u2
[18:03:48] <Kosingas> Ola
[18:04:08] <Kosingas> I have one nubbish question,what "junior" front end developer need to know?
[18:04:24] <Kosingas> html/css/bootstrap(maybe)/javascript/jquery, am I missing something?
[18:06:10] <taplar> logic
[18:06:28] <taplar> regardless of language
[18:06:59] <Kosingas> Beside "common logic",meaning every programmer at least needs to have developed logic thinking. Be serious.
[18:07:06] <taplar> no i am serious
[18:07:11] <Kosingas> I'm asking about technologies,not a common logic answers.
[18:07:20] <Kosingas> Of course logic thinking is required.
[18:07:26] <taplar> the number of people you run into that have trouble breaking down a problem is astouding some times
[18:07:32] <Kosingas> Where have you see programmer without ability of logic thinking?
[18:07:47] <taplar> here at my place mentoring some people.  in this room occasionally
[18:07:52] <Kosingas> Those are not developers. Total beginners.
[18:08:07] <taplar> they made it through college some how, :)
[18:08:09] <Kosingas> Im asking ,let's say,dude has a "logic", and now he asks himself,what ne heeds to know.
[18:09:08] <taplar> as far as languages goes. i think you have a decent list
[18:09:43] <taplar> though it also depends on where the person goes to work.  some shops may not be jquery shops
[18:10:36] <Kosingas> Yeah, I was thinking, is Angular absolute requirement for novice/junior? Since I saw many job postings that require Angular for junior dev.
[18:10:54] <Kosingas> Beside all the mentioned technologies above.
[18:11:08] <taplar> i wouldn't say an absolute.  probably handy to know
[18:12:06] <taplar> i've heard some talk of people going to reactjs and vuejs and such
[18:13:09] <taplar> oh, throw in some form of testing library in there
[18:13:16] <taplar> qunit or jasmine or something
[18:13:29] <taplar> imho, a need to know
[18:13:48] <Kosingas> Yeah, I also see vuejs is like a light alternative to angular.
[18:14:02] <Kosingas> Thank you your time and suggestions :)
[18:14:06] <taplar> from what i've read it's more compariable to react
[18:14:13] <taplar> angular is the whole MV* package
[18:14:22] <taplar> reactjs and vuejs are more for just the V
[18:14:23] <Kosingas> Aha, I see.
[18:30:17] <taplar> if I might ask, what's the question about?
[19:38:06] <d2k> hello jquery gods, I have a rather simple mini question: How can I say "is not, e.g. !=" on the following line of code: var isChromium = !!window.chrome;
[19:38:41] <robertmaxrees> drop one of the !!
[19:39:00] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of strange.  are you trying to see if window.chrome is defined?
[19:40:08] <d2k> :) I'm having a mobile detection that kinda puts chrome into a box, now for testing I just want to see if this simple line can be used to make a difference between chrome and chromium.
[19:40:51] <d2k> I'm gonna post a snippet if it works. Thanks so far - a lot!
[19:43:31] <d2k> Ok, he following code is not working as expected: http://pastebin.com/Me6LBwj0
[19:44:44] <d2k> with the "!!" both chrome and chromium got a red background color, with "!" none of them reacts. I was hoping that that it could work like that.
[19:45:56] <d2k> robertmaxrees: big thanks anyway, seems I need to try something more complex now
[19:48:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd rewrite it.
[19:48:37] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[19:49:08] <robertmaxrees> var isChromium = !!window.chrome; is what you want there.  then just do if (!isChromium) {}
[19:59:26] <d2k> robertmaxrees: That would have been such an outstanding ultra mini solution, however Chromium is not reacting. Would be nice if things could be so simple thou. Thanks a bunch, I'm gonna post something once I found a working alternative to it.
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to distinguich between chrome and chromium?
[20:00:04] <d2k> robertmaxrees: What I try to do is to fix the font-face behavior of Chromium which does some wrong font-weight, letter-spacing and stuff
[20:00:26] <d2k> Using googlefont Opensans in this case
[20:00:35] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to distinguish between chrome and chromium?
[20:00:57] <d2k> robertmaxrees: yes, exactly just that
[20:01:22] * taplar has never heard of a site having chromium specific code
[20:02:33] <d2k> taplar: really? In my market most people use the stock browser that came from their telcomm company. Since I doubt that kitkat users will download any Chrome browser Chromium is kinda the main thing to fix :(
[20:03:14] <taplar> telcomm, like a phone browser?
[20:03:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:03:20] <robertmaxrees> what do your analytics tell you?
[20:03:27] <robertmaxrees> because lots of people download chrome these days.
[20:03:43] <d2k> taplar: Yes, the default, so called "Internet" browser
[20:03:48] <robertmaxrees> however, http://stackoverflow.com/a/17279993
[20:03:58] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of hacks out there.
[20:04:24] <taplar> huh, never would have figured some hardware would ship with chromium
[20:06:16] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I get your point, I'm gonna look inside Analytics but I'm pre-scared. ;) Also thanks for the stackoverflow link, I'm having kinda 100 tabs opened, all with the same question "make a visible difference between chrome and chromium, e.g. detect chromium".
[20:08:07] <d2k> The good thing is, all cellphones above kitkat 4.4 come with preinstalled Chrome browser.
[20:09:15] <d2k> but the telcomm browser is still the main button to the internet for most users since the telcomms want people to use their crappy mess of historic and non-up to date code.
[20:09:58] <d2k> so I guess every telcomm browser has it's own issue going on. It's sad :)
[20:11:25] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I'm now testing that stuff with that link that you posted
[20:23:00] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[20:23:12] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have any analytics to back this up - it's just a feeling you've got?
[20:27:07] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Heres a wonderfull news and a bad side effect: Your code works like a charm on my modern Huawai smartphone, but it still does not show any effect on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.
[20:27:37] <robertmaxrees> define "does not show any effect".
[20:27:48] <robertmaxrees> you mean doesn't recognize it the way you're expecting it to
[20:28:13] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I tried a couple of times to clean the cache of the samsungs chromium browser, still not red background.
[20:28:33] <robertmaxrees> console log the object you're looking at.
[20:29:01] <d2k> robertmaxrees: But your code is the most smartest solution for any android chromium above that pretty old samsungs one.
[20:29:31] <robertmaxrees> but you're still spending time on a problem that may not even be an actual problem.
[20:30:34] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I agree on that, one should have millions of cellphones for testing ...or ignore them at all. :)
[20:30:46] <robertmaxrees> that's literally not what i'm saying at all.
[20:30:46] <taplar> lol
[20:30:49] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[20:31:18] <robertmaxrees> or you could actually at your analytics and make sure that you're fixing a problem for an actually meaningful segment ;)
[20:31:25] <robertmaxrees> but hey, what would i know about thta
[20:32:10] <d2k> robertmaxrees: That's so true, I'm now gonna take a look at Analytics
[20:32:16] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[20:33:09] <d2k> robertmaxrees: Actually I would love to have the perfect website but even my boss tells me to ignore that Chromium issue.
[20:33:52] <d2k> robertmaxrees: It's a messy output of text that I want to fix, not that messy to be ignored thou
[20:34:22] <d2k> robertmaxrees: One more time, thank you so much for all good input!
[20:37:03] <d2k> robertmaxrees: FYI: I ignored Analytics for years now since I want a universal output in general, be it iOS, Chrome or Chromium. It works pretty well, the once issue I found is that with the font-faces.
[20:40:17] <jonez> greetings. I noticed that jq 3.x says if you are doing "cross domain" requests via $.ajax that the dataType should be set to "script" for security reasons... do I absolutely need to make that change?
[20:40:29] <jonez> currently using jsonp
[20:41:42] <robertmaxrees> d2k you realize that literally no user is going to compare accross devices, right?
[20:41:51] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about pixel-perfect accuracy.
[20:43:48] <taplar> jonez: where did you read that?
[20:44:09] <jonez> taplar, https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#ajax
[20:44:22] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I'm a hell of a perfectionist, I feel bad about it, really bad because it hurts me all day. What I try to say is: I'm not using bootstrap at all, 20 years of webdevelopment experience, allways had to do it 1:1 pixel perfect in the companies I've been working on. You are totally right, especially in my current market theres no need for perfection. :)
[20:44:24] <jonez> "Breaking change: Cross-domain script requests must be declared"
[20:44:38] <taplar> right, scripts
[20:44:52] <taplar> from the docs it seems like scripts is for scripts, jsonp is for loading json
[20:45:15] <jonez> "This prevents the possibility of an attack where the remote site delivers non-script content but later decides to serve a script that has malicious intent."
[20:45:41] <robertmaxrees> jonez read the whole snippet though :) it's specific to certain calls.
[20:46:03] <jonez> jquery.ajax(), which I am using
[20:46:20] <robertmaxrees> "for a script on a domain other than the one that hosts the document"
[20:46:27] <robertmaxrees> are you calling for a script on another domain?
[20:46:29] <jonez> right, and that includes subdomains
[20:46:38] <jonez> my www site calls engine
[20:46:40] <jonez> etc
[20:46:55] <jonez> so yes.
[20:47:05] <robertmaxrees> then yes, you nmeed to set that option for all of them.
[20:47:13] <jonez> ok cool. ty for the clarification :)
[20:48:38] <d2k> robertmaxrees: My current market is a small country in south america, nobody really cares about details here, but they want to be silicon valley so heres were I suffer all day. :)

[20:52:44] <robertmaxrees> sure
[20:52:53] <robertmaxrees> d2k i'mn not the one with the issue ;)
[20:52:54] <d2k> been playing with it, kinda works but it's not "perfect" :D
[20:53:03] <robertmaxrees> if you want css help, there's an entire css channel.
[20:54:39] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I see, I'm gonna stop spamming now. Thanks for the talk, it's been a pleasure to hear your thoughts!
[21:04:13] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun
[21:54:38] <jamiejackson> hi folks. do you happen to see what i'm doing wrong? the each loop seems to append the unrendered string after the last tds of each rows; whereas the commented out version creates real dom tds https://gist.github.com/jamiejackson/5d5aa1076a2026b9753a62a307707648
[22:01:12] <jamiejackson> nm. figured out a way
[22:47:54] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!
[23:16:52] <hellyeah> yo
[23:44:50] <acidjazz> how can i loop through all children of an element
[23:44:56] <acidjazz> and i mean even children of children
[23:47:47] <arc_> acidjazz $(parent *)
[23:48:00] <arc_> sry with quotes
[23:48:45] <acidjazz> hmm
[23:49:18] <acidjazz> why not .children('*') then
[23:49:43] <acidjazz> so just .find('*') ?
[23:49:53] <arc_> lol, sure. there's more than one way to do it
[23:50:15] <acidjazz> there should be a .allmychildren()
[23:50:22] <acidjazz> dedicated to the soap operah
[23:50:34] <acidjazz> lol
[23:50:39] <acidjazz> you loled, admit it.
