[00:17:37] <DevAntoine> using deferred.fail() there's no better way than doing this? $.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseText)
[00:17:45] <DevAntoine> the response header is "application/json", it's very weird
[00:18:05] <DevAntoine> I was pretty sure that with deferred.fail() I could directly get my server's data and not make $.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseText). What am I missing?.
[00:18:53] <jailbot> $("#world").find("life").append("drugs");
[00:19:45] <Uhkis> jailbot: well that explains your nick ;-)
[00:21:26] <jailbot> $("#universe").find(".jackknife").kill();
[00:36:46] <DevAntoine> no one for my issue? :(

[01:25:36] <Celtiore> hi
[01:26:07] <Celtiore> i need help for jquery mobile ? which channel can i use
[01:42:59] <xec_> Celtiore: just ask here
[03:08:30] <flexd> I'm having some issues with a jquery plugin, jquery-dynatable. Do anyone have any experience with that?
[03:09:39] <ColdKeyboard> Can I upload a file with jquery and ajax?
[03:10:10] <ColdKeyboard> Can I just use serialize form or I need some plugin or something?
[03:11:04] <fabioportieri> how to apply progressive enhancement in this scenario: i have an image with opacity 0 that will be animated with full opacity when dom is ready. i want that when js is disabled the image starts with opacity 1..
[03:11:33] <flexd> ColdKeyboard: You can do a POST with the data as multipart-something, I can't quite remember
[03:12:19] <flexd> ColdKeyboard: This would be a good starting point to read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[03:14:02] <ravenzz> ColdKeyboard with xhr2 you can use FormData
[03:14:13] <ravenzz> to upload via ajax
[03:15:05] <ravenzz> fabioportieri usually you add a no-js class to the html elem, and later remove it with js. So .foo { opacity: 0; } .no-js .foo { opacity: 1; }
[03:15:26] <fabioportieri> ahh, like modernizr,, thanks
[03:15:30] <ravenzz> yep
[03:36:20] <Jqueryuser> does anyone know a way to call the internal functions used by Jquery for parsing an Ajax response. For example, I need to do somehting inside ajaxSuccess with the "request.responseText" (turn it into a jquery Object and filter it) but it's just text and will not convert :(
[03:38:43] <ravenzz> Jqueryuser what is responseText? a plain text rapresentation of a js object/json?
[03:38:59] <Jqueryuser> it's some html
[03:42:42] <ravenzz> so can't you just do something like var $foo = $('<div/>').html(request.responseText).children(); ?
[03:43:27] <Jqueryuser> I don't want to write it to the dom
[03:43:56] <Jqueryuser> waste of a repaint and it already gets written later after the callback
[03:43:57] <ravenzz> you're not writing them to the dom
[03:54:21] <wayne> hi, is d3 a viable alternative to jquery-svg?
[03:57:59] <seutje> wayne: d3 is especially useful if you want to bind your data to its visualisation, updating it as the data changes
[03:58:56] <seutje> it's highly tailored towards SVG manipulation, but the core feature is binding the data to it
[04:22:47] <_pingu> given is this jsonObject: http://pastebin.com/e45K51RP     how can I add  a key value pair to params?
[04:22:48] <jimi_> How can i detect idleness in mobile browsers? in pc browsers, i can look at key events and mouse
[04:23:15] <_pingu> given is this jsonObject: http://pastebin.com/e45K51RP     how can I add  a key value pair to params?
[04:26:25] <fabioportieri> _pingu: did you even try?
[04:54:02] <Tomashe> back
[05:22:26] <dekiss> can I animate zindex?
[05:25:57] <seutje> dekiss: you'd probably need a custom stepper function, but then still, wondering what the point is of animating z-index
[05:26:14] <dekiss> I have 3 animations on zindex on separate elements and it hapens one after another why?
[05:26:24] <seutje> it won't appear animated, as you'll only see a change (instantly) once the z-index rolls over a point of significance
[05:26:47] <seutje> dekiss: probably because of the way you wrote it, mind passing me the code?
[05:27:40] <dekiss> I have with and zindex in separate animation and they happen one after another
[05:27:52] <dekiss> seutje thay are not set as callbacks
[05:28:07] <seutje> did you specify queue: false?
[05:28:18] <dekiss> seutje http://pastie.org/8596918
[05:28:21] <dekiss> no
[05:28:26] <dekiss> please check if you can - thanks
[05:28:40] <dekiss> I click on eleemnt and it gets animated width after 1 second or so
[05:28:54] <dekiss> what is that queue?
[05:30:21] <seutje> you mean vocabulary-wise?
[05:30:50] <seutje> it's like a list of which the items are processed 1 by 1 in the order they appear in the queue
[05:30:52] <dekiss> no
[05:31:01] <dekiss> yeah I know ut in query I mean
[05:31:05] <seutje> it's prolly a 800ms delay
[05:31:08] <dekiss> waht is wrong in the code?
[05:31:08] <seutje> instead of 1s
[05:31:18] <seutje> you don't specify not to queue the animations
[05:31:24] <dekiss> hm when I click on element i wait more than 800ms I think
[05:31:31] <dekiss> now to do that?
[05:31:36] <seutje> erm wat?
[05:31:40] <dekiss> no queue
[05:31:45] <seutje> just delay?
[05:31:48] <dekiss> how to do all animations on all elements at once?
[05:32:18] <dekiss> I am not sure why when I click on element its width gets animated after about 1 s
[05:33:22] <dekiss> I have animate zindex in for loop
[05:33:27] <dekiss> maybe that is the problem?
[05:34:35] <dekiss> yes
[05:34:38] <dekiss> that is the problem
[05:34:40] <dekiss> how to solve it?
[05:35:09] <seutje> hmm, might need to use a custom queue
[05:35:20] <dekiss> it seems zindex is not animated at all
[05:35:23] <seutje> cause u'll need to queue to get the delay iirc
[05:35:25] <dekiss> but happes after 800 ms
[05:35:29] <seutje> no, I told you this like 10 mins ago
[05:35:34] <dekiss> wat?
[05:35:36] <dekiss> what *
[05:35:45] <dekiss> zindex can be animatesd?
[05:35:59] <seutje> seutje: dekiss: you'd probably need a custom stepper function, but then still, wondering what the point is of animating z-index
[05:35:59] <dekiss> ah
[05:36:01] <dekiss> sorry
[05:36:05] <dekiss> what is custom steper function
[05:36:08] <seutje> seutje: it won't appear animated, as you'll only see a change (instantly) once the z-index rolls over a point of significance
[05:36:11] <dekiss> so zindex can't be animated?
[05:36:20] <seutje> it's a function jquery runs at each step of the animation
[05:36:21] <dekiss> ohhhhh
[05:36:24] <dekiss> so how to do this :S
[05:36:32] <seutje> I don't even know what ur trying
[05:36:41] <dekiss> to animate index
[05:36:46] <seutje> u can't
[05:36:49] <dekiss> so I have 2 elements one is behind another
[05:36:51] <seutje> what effect would it have?
[05:37:00] <dekiss> when i click one it needs to come in front but with animation
[05:37:00] <seutje> should it fade magically?
[05:37:01] <dekiss> not instantly
[05:37:14] <seutje> how do u go in front of a flap plain without doing so instantly?
[05:37:17] <dekiss> can I do this?
[05:37:25] <dekiss> how you mean
[05:37:29] <seutje> either ur behind it, or ur in front of it
[05:37:31] <dekiss> can I do this effect somehow?
[05:37:34] <seutje> u can't be somewhere in between
[05:37:42] <seutje> I don't even know what it's suppose to look like
[05:37:49] <dekiss> yeah
[05:37:52] <dekiss> its confusing
[05:37:54] <dekiss> een I am confused
[05:37:56] <dekiss> let me think
[05:37:57] <fabioportieri> not with z-index you have to simulate it augmenting width/height and position to make it appears like it is zoomed
[05:38:00] <dekiss> how to explain
[05:38:05] <dekiss> and what I want :D
[05:38:11] <dekiss> you are right
[05:38:11] <dekiss> ..
[05:38:18] <seutje> if ur trying to create a zoom effect, better off translating then
[05:38:26] <dekiss> well I want the elements to go one in another
[05:38:27] <dekiss> :D
[05:38:29] <seutje> then ur dimensions don't fuck up the rest of the page
[05:38:30] <dekiss> magically yes haha
[05:38:35] <dekiss> I gues sthey cant
[05:38:42] <dekiss> ahh this is not real 3d
[05:38:47] <dekiss> css is not really 3d :(
[05:39:01] <seutje> 3d on a screen is not really 3d
[05:39:07] <dekiss> hm
[05:39:09] <dekiss> opengl is
[05:39:15] <seutje> haha
[05:39:16] <dekiss> no?
[05:39:18] <dekiss> :)
[05:39:23] <seutje> it appears to be
[05:39:27] <dekiss> hehe
[05:39:29] <dekiss> ^^
[05:39:29] <seutje> but ur still staring at a flat surface
[05:39:40] <dekiss> humans want to make 3d on 2d screen
[05:39:42] <dekiss> -_-
[05:39:48] <dekiss> its complicated and wrong way to do
[05:39:50] <seutje> move ur head to the side, perspective just got fucked :D
[05:39:53] <dekiss> we first need 3d screen,,,
[05:39:58] <dekiss> then 3d animation will be natural
[05:39:59] <dekiss> ..
[05:40:09] <dekiss> humans sometimes wnat to make unnatural things
[05:40:31] <dekiss> so we need hologram i guess
[05:40:32] <dekiss> :)
[05:40:34] <seutje> those 3d chalk drawing are a nice example of that
[05:40:37] <seutje> like http://www.dailyhaggis.com/img/julian02.jpg
[05:40:45] <seutje> it only looks 3d from the right angle
[05:40:45] <dekiss> yes
[05:40:53] <dekiss> those are especially good exampel of my point :)
[05:41:00] <dekiss> man and they call that science
[05:41:03] <dekiss> more like torture
[05:41:08] <seutje> meny maths
[05:41:12] <dekiss> some poor man painting for 3 months
[05:41:17] <seutje> and then it rains
[05:41:20] <dekiss> :D
[05:41:45] <dekiss> this is opengl in reallity
[05:48:34] <dekiss> can I animate box shadow?
[05:49:28] <dekiss> I ave problems with this
[05:50:24] <dekiss> seutje ^
[05:50:35] <fabioportieri> yes
[05:50:42] <seutje> should be animatable
[05:50:46] <fabioportieri> http://leaverou.github.io/animatable/
[05:51:42] <jphase> there's a few different extensions out there
[05:51:59] <seutje> fabioportieri: that's css animations, innit?
[05:52:09] <fabioportieri> yes css stuff
[05:52:23] <dekiss> ahhh
[05:52:24] <dekiss> how?
[05:52:35] <dekiss> I can't get this to work
[05:52:54] <fabioportieri> aniway iirc every property with numeric values is animatable by jquery
[05:53:02] <seutje> with css it's easy, set one of the regular element, one on the hover and specify transition property
[05:53:05] <dekiss> this in animate is not doing anything boxShadow : "0px 0px 5px 3px black"
[05:53:21] <seutje> with jquery, u'll need to separately specify the expando props
[05:53:33] <seutje> like boxShadowX
[05:53:37] <seutje> boxShadowBlur
[05:53:39] <fabioportieri> ^^
[05:53:41] <dekiss> seutje can you please tell me with jquery thans
[05:53:52] <dekiss> with transition on css I get transiton animated first then jquery animate
[05:53:54] <dekiss> looks very bad
[05:54:07] <dekiss> what is this :S
[05:54:08] <seutje> you can easily extend .animate to split it up for you though, here's one http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[05:54:21] <dekiss> omg :(
[05:54:28] <seutje> lol, don't do both css and jquery, of course ur gonna get duplicate animation then
[05:54:54] <dekiss> http://pastie.org/8597018
[05:54:57] <dekiss> this don't work S
[05:55:06] <dekiss> im confused :S
[05:55:12] <seutje> it's like I'm talking to a wall
[05:55:20] <dekiss> ahhhhhh
[05:55:20] <seutje> lemme copy/paste my own lines again
[05:55:28] <seutje> seutje: with jquery, u'll need to separately specify the expando props
[05:55:29] <dekiss> yo mean I need to animate shadow blur separately"? ":)
[05:55:34] <seutje> seutje: you can easily extend .animate to split it up for you though, here's one http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[05:55:35] <dekiss> ahhh ok
[05:55:36] <dekiss> :)
[05:55:39] <dekiss> nice thanks!
[05:56:35] <seutje> it already does this for props like border, but not the newer ones, I guess
[05:57:02] <dekiss> ahhhhhhhhhhhh
[05:57:45] <dekiss> I can't get this to work
[05:57:46] <dekiss> :S
[05:58:23] <dekiss> http://pastie.org/8597024 seutje okease help
[05:58:32] <dekiss> fabioportieri ^
[05:58:37] <jphase> dekiss: start a fiddle then
[05:58:42] <dekiss> in css i have box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px black;
[05:59:16] <gordian> dekiss: put your code on jsfiddle.net
[05:59:41] <xec_> dekiss: http://proj.jetless.org/AWESOME-TIME/
[06:00:40] <jphase> lol xec_
[06:00:46] <xec_> dekiss: nevermind the URL, it actually is what you want  :)
[06:01:45] <dekiss> xec_ ok thanks! :)
[06:02:24] <xec_> there's a link to css hooks at the top there
[06:03:02] <dekiss> xec_ this is text shadow
[06:03:05] <dekiss> i need box shadow :S
[06:03:22] <xec_> dekiss: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/boxshadow.js
[06:03:45] <xec_> there are hooks for both (and a lot more)
[06:04:24] <dekiss> what are hooks :S
[06:05:38] <xec_> basically, they let you add custom support for css properties to jquery
[06:06:25] <seutje> wtf, I told you this dekiss
[06:06:55] <seutje> jquery doesn't know them as css props, so it'll just slap them on as props and animate from 0 to whatever u told it to go to
[06:07:47] <seutje> dekiss: http://jsfiddle.net/xjK7B/ check external resources
[06:19:48] <dekiss> seutje thanks man ! yo uare good man :)

[06:28:10] <jphase> dekiss: you should really listen to the folks trying to help you, otherwise it's a waste of everyone's time :)
[06:28:47] <fabioportieri> clients love animations
[06:30:00] <xec_> lol yeah, too bad the end users usually don't ;)
[06:36:58] <Nephro> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ -- I used this thing but the text size is substantially larger than all of my other project, and even larger that in the example
[06:37:03] <Nephro> how would I make it smaller?
[06:40:02] <seutje> Nephro: what theme are you using? custom?
[06:40:15] <seutje> my guess would be that there is other CSS in your project more specific
[06:40:42] <Nephro> <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css"> -- this is from the example code
[06:40:52] <Nephro> and my other css have nothing to do with text formatting
[06:41:18] <donmatthew> Hey, I want to loop an array inside an array, how is this possible?
[06:41:20] <donmatthew> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2809caceaf1d2d7c5f61
[06:41:27] <seutje> odd... well you can inspect it and check the computed tab to figure out what has last word on it
[06:41:35] <donmatthew> var buttons are the same as [button_parameters]
[06:42:07] <seutje> donmatthew: not sure I understand, you can just go [[]] ?
[06:42:25] <donmatthew> will that loop button_parameters?
[06:42:40] <seutje> oooh wait
[06:42:46] <donmatthew> thnx
[06:42:48] <donmatthew> :)
[06:42:50] <seutje> u want buttons to be an array of "buttons" objects?
[06:43:04] <donmatthew> true
[06:43:15] <donmatthew> im sending var button = {} from another class
[06:43:27] <donmatthew> that's why they don't have the same name
[06:43:38] <donmatthew> so buttons == button_parameters
[06:43:38] <seutje> var buttons = []; for (var i = 0, max = 10; i < max; i++) { buttons.push({some: 'stuff' }); } ?
[06:44:02] <seutje> the loop would depend on where ur data is coming from
[06:44:14] <donmatthew> is it possible to put that code inside an array?
[06:44:38] <seutje> I lost you again :x
[06:44:43] <seutje> what's your goal?
[06:45:05] <Nephro> seutje, can I somehow override the params in the .ui-widget class?
[06:45:25] <donmatthew> seutje: I want to add as many buttons I want from another function into that dialog-array.
[06:45:38] <donmatthew> jsonHandler.prototype.dialog = function(view, title, content, button_parameters) {
[06:46:49] <seutje> donmatthew: u want to add buttons after the dialog has been initialized? or before?
[06:46:57] <seutje> if it's before, just construct the array and pass it
[06:47:15] <seutje> Nephro: sure, just make them more specific (or remove the offending lines)

[06:48:36] <davetarmac> hey guys o/
[06:49:35] <davetarmac> Anyone know where I can find a menu that is a vertical list of icons, then when clicked it expands out, pushing the page content, revealing icon labels and any subpages for the menu item?
[07:02:42] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented the Dropzone library in on form but It not works. I implemented the css, the JS and I opened the form with tha class "dropzone", but the form its not clickable. Any help? http://jsfiddle.net/nLMKp/2/
[07:03:04] <joro> hey, can i know the width of a classname withoout adding the element to dom ?
[07:10:36] <dolphone> hi, does anyone remember the name of the jquery mobile WYSIWYG? it used to be on their home page before they switched to jquery, ui, and mobile all being hosted on the same site. it looks like this: https://codiqa.com/demo
[07:10:45] <dolphone> you used to be able to download that off of github somewhere
[07:17:06] <dekiss> can I put animated gif with transparent background on home page?
[07:17:34] <dolphone> gifs don't have an alpha channel
[07:20:49] <fabioportieri> you can simulate animated png with css tho
[07:22:23] <dolphone> itll be a longer page load time too. people will hate you. HATE YOU
[07:23:27] <fabioportieri> i feed on people hatred
[07:28:12] <seutje> dekiss: use a PNG sprite and animate the background position
[07:28:19] <seutje> that's usually how ppl do it
[07:28:31] <seutje> like Google's doodles
[07:28:33] <bongjovi> ^ best method
[07:28:47] <seutje> GOLD IS BEST!
[07:28:55] <seutje> sry :$
[07:30:29] <fabioportieri> ^^ you may need to specify step for sprite animations
[07:32:02] <seutje> yeah, you don't want to .animate it to the next image in the sprite, u wanna move there instantly, once every frame
[07:32:21] <seutje> so .animate would prolly be undesired
[07:32:23] <grafi> dont tell me what I want
[07:32:24] <grafi> :o
[07:32:38] <seutje> requestanimationfame seems more useful in this case
[07:32:43] <seutje> lol... "fame"
[07:32:50] <grafi> xD
[07:32:56] <grafi> freudian slip
[07:33:03] <grafi> seutje just wants to be famous
[07:33:42] <seutje> haha
[07:34:01] <seutje> I actually used to change nickname every few years to avoid being recognized anywhere :P
[07:35:01] <grafi> and now you want to be famous
[07:35:02] <grafi> :P

[08:17:38] <dogmatic69> Hi all, I am using UI autocomplete and cant get anything to show in the box even though json is returned (as seen in the console)
[08:18:30] <dogmatic69> Anynone know how to adjust the format of the data to match in the response callback?
[08:19:12] <blackteacup> anyone know of a video player where you can play a clip before the video starts? eg advertisement
[08:27:18] <fps> disclaimer: i don't like facebook and just try to help a friend: we have to check about 1000 checkboxes on the facebook invite page and i thought 'hey, why not automate that?'
[08:27:24] <fps> anyways, the elements look like this:
[08:27:42] <fps> <li class="multiColumnCheckable checkableListItem selectedCheckable" aria-label="Literaturmagazin Macondo" role="option">
[08:27:46] <grafi> just checking all the checkboxes?
[08:27:56] <fps> and i have to set the selectCheckable class i think
[08:28:00] <fps> this is what i tried in console;
[08:28:06] <fps> $("li.multiColumnCheckable").addClass("selectedCheckable")
[08:28:27] <fps> but i get an error: [17:24:38.282] Error: <![EX[["Tried to get element with id of \"%s\" but it is not present on the page.","li.multiColumnCheckable"]]]>
[08:29:00] <fps> grafi: yes, so i can manually filter out some that we don't want to invite ;D
[08:29:09] <fps> that is the much smaller set though ;D
[08:30:13] <grafi> hm not familiar with facebook invite pages but just doing $(':checkbox').prop('checked', true) doesnt work?
[08:30:16] <fps> facebook seems to implement checkboxes in a weird way, too
[08:30:34] <fps> grafi: i don;t want to just check all checkboxes on the page (there might be hidden stuff, etc.)
[08:30:44] <grafi> well
[08:30:48] <fps> the invite dialog is an overlay
[08:31:00] <grafi> $(':checkbox:visible').prop('checked', true)
[08:31:01] <grafi> :P
[08:31:14] <grafi> idk
[08:32:00] <fps> i guess i might limit it to descendants of the div.listSection
[08:32:21] <grafi> probably a good idea regardless
[08:32:49] <fps> before looking into that i'll try your way.. but the checkboxes seem to behave weird. the only thing that changes in the inspector when i check a checkbox is that particular class 'selectedCheckable'
[08:33:38] <fps> but i also wonder what the error i got above means really
[08:33:39] <fps> hmm
[08:33:48] <grafi> well good luck :P
[08:33:54] <fps> thanks
[08:35:48] <fps> ah, jquery isn't really loaded it seems
[08:40:57] <fps> damn me, will i have to implement a convolution of the browser page image to locate checkboxes and perform the mouse clicks?
[09:22:19] <hfp> Hi! I am using ajaxSubmit() from the form plugin to POST variables to a PHP script which parses them and returns the result in a JSON string (i.e. {"operation1":true,"operation2":false}. I would like to then parse this answer in the PHP page that posted the variables to display relevant success or failure alerts. I know what to use in PHP to decode the JSON object but what I am missing is how to retrieve the actual JSON from the ajaxSu
[09:22:19] <hfp> and pass it to the PHP script. Could anyone point me in the right direction?
[09:23:07] <hfp> No, that came off wrong, I need to do the parsing in jQuery to manipulate the DOM and show the relevant success or failure messages
[09:23:22] <hfp> Since the page is not refreshed
[09:27:16] <dekiss> is there any premade togglers
[09:27:20] <dekiss> with animation
[09:27:26] <dekiss> to toggel from one state to another?
[09:30:22] <joro> how can i make this event work only for elements with some class? http://jsfiddle.net/6zjwd/1/
[09:32:28] <duch_kazatel> joro you want the jquery version?
[09:33:39] <csurap> Any one using plupload ?
[09:33:46] <duch_kazatel> joro it'd look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6zjwd/2/
[09:35:14] <joro> it will work the same?
[09:35:28] <csurap> For some reason, plupload is not loading flash object in IE8
[09:36:02] <duch_kazatel> joro that's how you bind events the jquery way.
[09:37:31] <joro> yea
[09:37:36] <joro> but the event isn't triggering
[09:38:09] <duch_kazatel> does the element exist on pageload?  or are you injecting it later?
[09:39:24] <faianca> joro jquery doesn't have a mousestop event
[09:39:45] <faianca> at least it didn't have before, guess there is a plugin for it somewhere tho
[09:39:51] <joro> it exists
[09:39:59] <joro> the problem the code in the return function doesn't run
[09:40:05] <joro> problem is*
[09:40:24] <ahmedelgabri> whois ahmedelgabri
[09:40:43] <duch_kazatel> joro do you just want to run that function?  you don't have to return it...
[09:41:19] <joro> i need to run it so when the mouse stop it will run the mousestop function
[09:41:24] <joro> i don't have to return it
[09:41:33] <duch_kazatel> then bind to the mousestop event :)
[09:41:33] <faianca> it's an hack for the mousestop event
[09:41:53] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i see what you're saying.
[09:42:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> using jquery sortables has anyone experienced an issue with tables
[09:42:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/
[09:42:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> (to experience issue drag each of the column headers
[09:42:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> )
[09:43:21] <duch_kazatel> joro - i'd look for a plugin to handle it for you.
[09:43:46] <car>  am using ajax using java script but i am getting error with xmlhttp.status which is alsways 0
[09:44:13] <duch_kazatel> car have a link to a jsfiddle?
[09:46:25] <faianca> joro: what about this http://jsfiddle.net/6zjwd/4/ ?
[09:47:48] <faianca> joro: check the console, and test it, it will be pretty much of what u need, you just need to do a chain with mouseleave to stop it if it goes out
[09:54:01] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[09:54:02] <car> duch_kazatel  http://jsfiddle.net/srinathkodali/Hc6Dq/
[09:54:21] <wa5ted> Velveeta: around?
[09:54:30] <Velveeta> technically, what's up?
[09:54:45] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/
[09:54:55] <wa5ted> im having trouble wiht jquery sortabled
[09:54:57] <wa5ted> *sortables
[09:55:06] <wa5ted> drag each of the headers
[09:55:11] <wa5ted> and you will see what i mean
[09:55:46] <wa5ted> i think its because I have a column-cell setup as opposed to a row-cell
[10:01:48] <Velveeta> looks like it's forcing the width of your draggable element to 100%, which is forcing the other columns to wrap downwards
[10:02:00] <wa5ted> hmmmmm
[10:03:17] <wa5ted> Velveeta: wait where am i doing that
[10:03:31] <Velveeta> i don't know that you are, i'm gonna guess jqui is maybe?
[10:05:23] <Velveeta> and now i have to go for a bit, playing videogames w/ the kiddo
[10:05:52] <car> i am using ajax using java script but i am getting error with xmlhttp.status which is alsways 0     i am using the code http://jsfiddle.net/srinathkodali/Hc6Dq/
[10:13:20] <wa5ted> Velveeta: lol
[10:13:30] <wa5ted> ill poke around doubt ill find anything
[10:41:40] <amarulaa> hello, I have a session variable in PHP. I need to use that session variable inside index.php but inside a .js file that's been called with <script> tags...how can I achieve this without showing the variable to the user on the source? thanks.
[10:50:48] <masscrx> anybody with experience with cakephp and datatable?
[10:52:15] <faianca> masscrx: just go with the question
[10:52:45] <guideX> imo zurb foundation sucks
[10:53:00] <guideX> .. hard to customize, full of little glitches etc
[10:53:30] <guideX> any idea how to make it so when someone types on a zurb select, it advances normally?
[10:55:26] <faianca> guideX: what do you mean by advance?
[10:55:47] <guideX> well in a select list, usually when you type, forinstance if I hit a, and one of the items is apple, it'll select apple
[10:56:23] <faianca> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/forms.html
[10:56:27] <faianca> it's well documentated here
[10:56:31] <faianca> with a working example
[10:56:56] <guideX> well everything is working except that
[10:57:03] <masscrx> i have datatable script, i want to delete multiple items from table
[10:57:12] <guideX> that page doesn't appear to have what I'm looking for
[10:57:17] <guideX> i've been here..
[10:57:31] <masscrx> so in ajax request to php controller i have something like: selected: 1, 2, 3...
[10:57:54] <faianca> guideX: i click on the select, i type H and it does advance normally
[10:58:04] <masscrx> and now im thinking how to make function in cakehp to delete this multiple items
[10:58:11] <guideX> well on this page it does, on mine it doesn't
[10:58:15] <masscrx> before without java thins was simpler ;]
[10:58:20] <guideX> and when I build a vanilla example , it doesn't
[10:58:37] <faianca> so you have something wrong i guess, let me go check the example quickly
[10:59:23] <faianca> masscrx: you can create an helper, or even create a function in the controller, private, so when you post the values with datatables, you call it with $this->
[11:00:42] <faianca> guideX: i just downloaded it, i open the index.html and i try the select box, it works
[11:00:50] <guideX> hmm weird
[11:00:51] <faianca> didn't do anything
[11:01:11] <guideX> maybe it's just that i'm using an older version
[11:01:41] <faianca> i tried with the 5.0.2
[11:02:04] <guideX> that's part of my problem, each component has a different version, and i'm not sure what the final version is in the end
[11:02:12] <wa5ted> Velveeta: still havent figured it out
[11:02:23] <guideX> for insatnce, foundation forms is one version, each other peice is a diff version
[11:02:51] <guideX> thanks i'll figure it out from here
[11:02:56] <guideX> just have old versions I think
[11:03:02] <faianca> guideX: that is why i don't like to use this kind of frameworks :P
[11:03:19] <guideX> yeah me neither.. cause the previous developer has customized this older version
[11:03:25] <guideX> now I don't know what's broken etc :(
[11:03:40] <faianca> hehe good luck :P
[11:03:53] <guideX> thx :))
[11:04:35] <faianca> If you can tell me which version do u have
[11:05:05] <faianca> and an example on pastebin, i might can help you out
[11:05:27] <guideX> looks like 2.0.1
[11:05:51] <guideX> i'll try an upgrade, and come back if i'm still stuck :))
[11:06:09] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[11:07:10] <faianca> ok
[11:07:53] <joro> if i got an event like $(document).on('mouseout','.someClass', function(){});
[11:08:14] <joro> when i go on elements inside someClass container the event triggers
[11:08:27] <joro> how can i stop that?
[11:08:53] <duch_kazatel> joro unbind the event on document.
[11:09:28] <joro> what do you mean?
[11:09:44] <duch_kazatel> that syntax binds an event listener that makes use of event delegation.
[11:10:21] <joro> so how can i make it work?
[11:10:22] <duch_kazatel> basically, when you trigger an event in the document, it "bubbles up" all the way to "document" - all parent containers are notified of the event.
[11:10:39] <joro> yea i know
[11:10:44] <duch_kazatel> check out http://api.jquery.com/off/
[11:11:00] <joro> maybe i wasn't clear
[11:11:36] <wa5ted> duch_kazatel: mind assisting?
[11:11:38] <joro> i have some divs with this class whenever you go on one of them i add a mouseout event
[11:11:48] <wa5ted> once you can spare the time
[11:11:54] <joro> to that same class
[11:11:55] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted with what?
[11:12:10] <wa5ted> jquery ui sortable table that is getting some unusual behaviour
[11:12:15] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/
[11:12:20] <duch_kazatel> wa5ted i don't know anything about that, sorry.
[11:12:26] <wa5ted> :(
[11:12:30] <wa5ted> thanks anyways
[11:12:44] <duch_kazatel> and joro why are you binding like that?  why not bind both events when the document has loaded?
[11:13:08] <faianca> wa5ted: what is the unusual behavior?
[11:17:54] <Technical_13> Can anyone help me figure out why I'm not getting my array in http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/Rr53M/ ?
[11:18:22] <duch_kazatel> Technical_13 because that's not how you use an array in js.
[11:18:42] <duch_kazatel> Technical_13 you want an object instead.
[11:18:43] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:19:15] <Technical_13> So, I can't do multidimensional associative arrays in js?  foo
[11:20:56] <faianca> of course you can
[11:22:36] <faianca> Technical_13: in that fiddle you getting a response with html text and xml
[11:23:00] <Technical_13> http://ddowiki.com/api.php?action=query&list=allusers&auprop=blockinfo|editcount|groups&aulimit=10&auprefix=Ada
[11:23:06] <Technical_13> is teh query manually done.
[11:23:46] <Technical_13> http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/Rr53M/1/ as an object didn't work either
[11:25:05] <Technical_13> do I have the datType wrong?
[11:25:36] <amarulaa> guys, I need to tell this to someone it is a solution I found to my script...but I need to share it with one of you to see if you guys think it is cool...please!
[11:26:42] <faianca> Technical_13: let me check if ddowiki accepts jsonp
[11:26:59] <Technical_13> json didn't work at all..
[11:28:32] <duch_kazatel> all right i'm back.
[11:29:17] <duch_kazatel> Technical_13 you can do multidimensional arrays in JS, sure - arrays hold objects.  but you can't treat arrays like hashes.  you can treat objects like hashes though.
[11:30:37] <Technical_13> Wish there was come consistancy between languages... PHP is simply array[index => "element"]...
[11:31:26] <Technical_13> duch_kazatel: can you make an edit to my fiddle and post the link so I can see what you mean?
[11:32:43] <duch_kazatel> sure - it'll be something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Rr53M/3/
[11:32:59] <duch_kazatel> not sure if line 14 is necessary.
[11:33:02] <amarulaa> I had a index.php script...which calls some .js files....in my php script I had a session variable which I needed to use inside my javascript files..that variable is the userID, the problem was that I was getting some POST variables manipulated that one of my files (the one that adds points to the user) uses to write to the DB. This other file that writes to the database needs the user_id to create the query along with the amount of points to add to the use
[11:33:03] <amarulaa> The thing is...javascript was sending both this variables to the php file thru an ajax call....and my query was something like ... INSERT $_POST[points] WHERE id=$_POST[id]; so the users that could look at the id on the source code...(I am echoing the ID like id = <?php echo $_SESSION['id'] ?> in order to be used by my js scripts) could use it to inject points to the php script without even being in the app. The solution I found was...I still show the user 
[11:33:04] <amarulaa> to be used by other js scripts...but now my query uses the $_POST[points] WHERE id=$_SESSION[id] so they can actually throw points to the script...but they get nowhere because the WHERE is now server side...is it good solution? thanks.
[11:33:44] <faianca> Technical_13: there u go, http://jsfiddle.net/dyeqy/30/ an working example for you
[11:33:46] <duch_kazatel> but basically js object properties can be access with square bracket notation - that'll evaluate whatever is between the brackets to determine what property to access.
[11:34:23] <faianca> Technical_13: console.log(data.query.allusers) etc... just go through the object in the console
[11:36:07] <amarulaa> I know is long...but please read what I wrote haha
[11:36:09] <amarulaa> :P
[11:36:13] <codekK> Hello im newbie with jquery and i have a little question about style in code. Its correct to use more than one $(document).ready in same script? for separate differents events. ?
[11:36:28] <amarulaa> I'm a lonely girl trying to stop some idiots from adding points without even playing with the web app
[11:36:30] <amarulaa> lol
[11:36:57] <duch_kazatel> codekK use just one and nest everything under it.
[11:37:03] <amarulaa> codekK: nest it

[11:37:16] <codekK> okey
[11:37:23] <codekK> thanks
[11:37:26] <amarulaa> there's no need to use many
[11:37:38] <amarulaa> nevertheless....I don't think it should error on you
[11:38:00] <amarulaa> it should work but it is not correctly done
[11:38:18] <codekK> and the functions i use on my code out of $(doc).ready..; and call it inside ?
[11:38:19] <amarulaa> maybe duch_kazatel knows better
[11:38:22] <codekK> or its wrong?
[11:38:34] <amarulaa> nothing wrong

[11:41:48] <amarulaa> Velveeta: why don't you read what I wrote? :P
[11:41:56] <amarulaa> to see if you can throw me your opinion
[11:42:01] <wa5ted> faianca: you still around?
[11:42:12] <duckgoose> /nickserv identify x754E14
[11:42:24] <wa5ted> duckgoose: FAIL
[11:42:39] <faianca> wa5ted: yes
[11:42:46] <faianca> Technical_13: http://jsfiddle.net/dyeqy/31/ look like this
[11:42:48] <duch_kazatel> woops
[11:43:13] <wa5ted> faianca: so ya my placeholders get all messed up i think it has to do with the styling the plugin is adding but i cant figure it out
[11:43:15] <faianca> Technical_13: you need to loop the users to insert them to the array
[11:43:18] <Velveeta> i just finished reading what you wrote
[11:43:38] <Velveeta> this is my first comment to you amarulaa :) http://xkcd.com/327/
[11:44:03] <Velveeta> always sanitize your inputs
[11:44:26] <Velveeta> never just plug a get/post var into a query as-is, like where id = $_POST['id']
[11:44:54] <faianca> wa5ted: can you post your jsfiddle once more?
[11:44:59] <Velveeta> because all it takes is someone modifying that post from the client-side to send something like this: id="0; truncate table users; --"
[11:45:10] <Velveeta> and they hose your db
[11:45:22] <Technical_13> faianca: I just want one user
[11:45:38] <wa5ted> faianca: np :) http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/
[11:45:48] <wa5ted> drag the headers of the table
[11:45:49] <wa5ted> to sort
[11:46:35] <faianca> Technical_13: change your url then to get only one user
[11:47:02] <Technical_13> it does get only one user.
[11:47:26] <Velveeta> my other comment would be that yes, you should keep the user id in the session data, and as far as your points storage is concerned, i can't comment too much on that without knowing how your db schema is set up
[11:47:41] <Technical_13> http://ddowiki.com/api.php?action=query&list=allusers&format=jsonfm&callback=?&auprop=blockinfo|editcount|groups&aulimit=1&auprefix=Ada898  then &aulimit=1 limits it to just the one user.
[11:47:57] <Velveeta> it kind of looks like you're inserting separate point values in a table keyed by user id, and then summing them maybe? to get the user's total points?

[11:50:27] <wa5ted> faianca: thanks
[11:50:31] <Velveeta> amarulaa: did you see my responses?
[11:50:36] <wa5ted> Velveeta: i was in #android the otherday
[11:50:41] <wa5ted> funny shit happened
[11:50:55] <wa5ted> so this guy started i am not joking pasting all his lines of code into the editor
[11:51:00] <wa5ted> and it came in waves
[11:51:11] <Velveeta> aye yai yai
[11:51:14] <wa5ted> literally no one could ask questions for like 5 mins straight
[11:51:22] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:51:38] <wa5ted> and then this guy has the never to call me a noob cause im asking about some styling questions
[11:51:50] <wa5ted> (i started android dev a few days ago)
[11:52:29] <Velveeta> i've only dabbled in android dev, years ago, when i had dreams of app-entrepreneurship-grandeur
[11:53:53] <ratmav> hi, i've run into a weird issue and i'm could use some help.
[11:54:29] <ratmav> i'm using .before() to insert some content using a link, but i'm getting multiple copies of the content inserted.
[11:55:06] <ratmav> if i use $(document).on("click", "id"... i get multiple copies
[11:55:39] <ratmav> if i just $("id").click, i get what i want - a single copy of the content inserted. does anyone have any idea why?
[11:57:40] <wa5ted> Velveeta: what changed
[11:58:06] <NoiseEee> ratmav: the second is correct; you attach it to the ID, not the whole document
[11:58:24] <wa5ted> NoiseEee: it has to do with progation
[11:58:31] <wa5ted> *propogation
[11:58:33] <visua> hey all, could someone suggest a good lightbox plugin with 'cover' style image support?
[11:58:53] <wa5ted> visua: devlop your own
[11:58:56] <wa5ted> its not har
[11:58:57] <wa5ted> hard
[11:58:58] <NoiseEee> wa5ted: not when he's trying to use an ID as the additional selector in the document.on
[11:59:06] <wa5ted> oh okay
[11:59:14] <visua> wa5ted I would prefer not to in this case.
[11:59:26] <visua> It's a personal project and I don't feel like writing much from scratch.
[11:59:35] <wa5ted> visua: this one i have used in the past
[11:59:37] <wa5ted> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[11:59:50] <wa5ted> visua: if you write from scratch ill help you it isnt hard
[11:59:56] <ratmav> NoiseEee, that makes sense to me - it's what i tried on my own after a bit. i got the original example from a rails cast - not sure why they did it that way
[11:59:58] <wa5ted> you want to do a modal sort of thing right?
[12:00:18] <wa5ted> faianca: your still there right?
[12:00:33] <NoiseEee> ratmav: its possible they were illustrating 'event delegation', and the selector in the document.on() was a class instead of ID... if not, then bad railscast :)
[12:00:36] <visua> Yeah, lemme show you my mockups
[12:00:44] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/mn-1.jpg
[12:00:55] <visua> so you'd click a thumbnail in the grid there
[12:00:56] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/mn-2.jpg
[12:01:03] <visua> and get a fullscreen modal like in the second screen
[12:01:28] <faianca> wa5ted: yes, it's more a css problem than js
[12:01:29] <ratmav> NoiseEee, you're right, it was a class. i was using "id" just as a placeholder for irc. in reality, i am using a class
[12:01:30] <Velveeta> wa5ted: what changed was that life gave me a swift kick in the balls and let me know who was the boss
[12:01:47] <faianca> wa5ted: lets see if i can fix it quickly, i have mates here, don't have alot atention init
[12:01:48] <wa5ted> Velveeta: well put
[12:01:50] <Velveeta> plus, i'm much happier as a web developer than i ever would have been as a native app developer
[12:01:59] <visua> actually, this looks to do the effect quite nicely
[12:02:00] <visua> http://pixelentity.com/previews/components/flare/
[12:02:08] <visua> However i'm not seeing any inline gallery here.
[12:02:09] <Velveeta> especially with the proliferation of html5 as a unversal app source
[12:02:26] <NoiseEee> ratmav: so in reality, it should fire once :)  make a fiddle if you need.
[12:02:30] <ratmav> NoiseEee, still not sure why it appeared to work smoothly in the railscast but not for me. i got it working, but am wondering why i had to call the class directly and the railscast guy didn't
[12:02:45] <wa5ted> visua: ooooooooo!!! i like the mock ups
[12:02:49] <wa5ted> very pretty :)
[12:02:50] <visua> thanks :)
[12:03:03] <visua> trying to get a new portfolio up since i got nothing right now
[12:03:07] <visua> just something quick and easy
[12:03:13] <wa5ted> ya im trying to do the same
[12:03:14] <guideX> I think I would be happier developing native apps; I'm a native app developer forced into web dev :/
[12:03:16] <visua> bah, i have a meeting brb
[12:03:34] <ratmav> NoiseEee, thanks. i'll look more into event delegation
[12:04:06] <faianca> wa5ted: k, let's see if it's what you want, gonna update it
[12:04:18] <wa5ted> faianca: thanks
[12:04:25] <wa5ted> visua: cya later
[12:04:37] <wa5ted> guideX: how did you get "forced" into web
[12:04:52] <faianca> wa5ted:  http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/1/  i cleaned alot, but check it out
[12:05:10] <wa5ted> Velveeta: i enjoy being a web devloper, trust me when hybrid apps become more viable, i will move to that rather than native, but for the time being doesnt hurt to learn native dev
[12:05:44] <wa5ted> faianca: forgot to mention something
[12:05:49] <wa5ted> i need the placeholder
[12:05:54] <wa5ted> thats the part that wasnt working
[12:07:02] <guideX> well it was a second choice really
[12:07:05] <jedimind> why do complex js libraries exist for lightboxes still
[12:07:09] <BlakeH> Anyone have experience with Selectivizr?
[12:07:10] <jedimind> and why are they $10
[12:07:14] <jedimind> BlakeH yes
[12:07:18] <guideX> i'd rather be in native, but everyone seems to hire for web
[12:07:39] <guideX> over the years, I just gave in, and took whatever web junk
[12:07:50] <jedimind> native is dying slowly :(
[12:08:04] <jedimind> you can do some cool shit with mobile web these days
[12:08:13] <BlakeH> I cant get it to work with IE8. i had a @font-face in a site.css that i removed and put into the Head thinking that would be the solution (as per suggested by this site: http://stiankarlsen.me/blog/how-to-fix-selectivizr-in-ie8/) but it still doesn't work.
[12:08:22] <BlakeH> I am just using :Not()
[12:08:26] <guideX> true but web seems all over the place
[12:09:00] <faianca> wa5ted: and you really need to forcePlaceholderSize ?
[12:09:11] <wa5ted> nope
[12:09:25] <wa5ted> i just need a placeholder where the currently selected item will go
[12:10:50] <guideX> anyone know why jquery custom forms 1.0 http://jsfiddle.net/hzrLt/ how to fix the select list advancing normally? (sorry I couldn't get a fiddle to work with this)
[12:11:53] <faianca> wa5ted: so try to remove forcePlaceholderSize
[12:12:27] <faianca> wa5ted: and let me know if that works, if not you might need to change the placehold width and height on the start event, but it's just a guess i didn't try
[12:12:33] <guideX> .. like when the user types..
[12:12:41] <faianca> and i'm not an expert, not even close
[12:13:09] <wa5ted> faianca: wait a sec
[12:13:58] <wa5ted> faianca: how would I make the laceholder width the same as that of the currently dragging item
[12:14:13] <faianca> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/2/ like this?
[12:14:55] <wa5ted> faianca: ya like that, but why exactly is the table moving when i move the id
[12:14:59] <dolphone> hi, does anyone remember the name of the jquery mobile WYSIWYG? it used to be on their home page before they switched to jquery, ui, and mobile all being hosted on the same site. it looks like this: https://codiqa.com/demo
[12:15:11] <dolphone> you used to be able to download it from github
[12:16:18] <faianca> wa5ted: cuz the placeholder width
[12:16:36] <faianca> wa5ted:  look at this example now, http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/3/
[12:17:02] <faianca> since i altered the placeholder, you can even change it the way you want in the start event, using the item width
[12:17:13] <faianca> i hope i'm in the same page as you are tho haha
[12:17:19] <BlakeH> so basically Selectivizr is useless
[12:17:59] <wa5ted> faianca: ya we are, its just the placeholder width i creating extra width which isnt necessarily needed
[12:18:26] <wa5ted> faianca: got it
[12:18:32] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/4/
[12:18:36] <faianca> wa5ted: then you can change it static from the css, or you can change it dynamic from the start event ;)
[12:18:40] <wa5ted> had to modify .red
[12:18:54] <wa5ted> stupid class
[12:18:56] <faianca> good
[12:19:29] <wa5ted> faianca: antoher question jquery sortables, how exactly is the movement made when items are switched (i hope to animate that movement
[12:20:24] <faianca> wa5ted: no idea, never used sortables need to check the documentation haha
[12:20:30] <wa5ted> okay thanks
[12:20:33] <faianca> np
[12:20:36] <wa5ted> ill be back for more later :P
[12:20:45] <faianca> anytime
[12:27:01] <guideX> I guess I have to build the ability into my select list like this.. $("body").on("hover", "li", function (e) {
[12:27:05] <guideX> or something less crude
[12:27:09] <visua> wa5ted – sorry about having to bail mid convo.
[12:27:18] <guideX> well not with hover either..
[12:31:03] <wa5ted> visua: no problemo
[12:31:11] <wa5ted> but ya my protfolio is small as shit
[12:31:16] <wa5ted> i have to add updates to it
[12:31:28] <visua> I just have a landing page up @ michaelnovia.net
[12:33:13] <csurap> I'm trying to use 'birthday' field type, but i'm getting "Catchable Fatal Error: Argument 1 passed to Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\ChoiceList\MonthChoiceList::__construct() must be an instance of IntlDateFormatter, null given"
[12:34:03] <wa5ted> visua: dammmmmmmnnnnn'
[12:34:18] <wa5ted> visua: rohan.bhangui.com and  dribbble.com/rohanbhangui
[12:34:22] <wa5ted> is where im at
[12:35:17] <visua> cool
[12:36:45] <wa5ted> visua: be honest, it sucks right :P
[12:36:51] <visua> no
[12:37:03] <visua> there's some cool stuff in there
[12:37:58] <wa5ted> lol
[12:37:59] <guideX> how do I get the li out of this ... $("body").live("keypress", "li", function (e) {
[12:38:03] <guideX> I am only getting the body
[12:38:13] <wa5ted> faianca: question: why cant i set the backgorund color of the placeholder
[12:38:22] <dolphone> change live to on
[12:38:30] <wa5ted> ^^agreed
[12:38:40] <guideX> when I do that it doesn't work at all
[12:38:53] <guideX> it only seems to work with live
[12:39:06] <dolphone> thats the correct syntax. what version of jquery are you using?
[12:39:16] <guideX> 1.8
[12:39:17] <faianca> wa5ted: let me hcekc
[12:39:27] <dolphone> or... something between your li and body could be calling stopImmediatePropogation so it never bubbles up to body
[12:39:28] <wa5ted> k
[12:39:37] <guideX> oic
[12:39:40] <guideX> that's probably it
[12:39:41] <wa5ted> faianca: in case you wnat current fiddle
[12:39:42] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/4/
[12:39:52] <csurap> 'birthday' field type started working after I delete the intl extension
[12:39:56] <wa5ted> dolphone: isnt it stopPropogation();
[12:39:58] <csurap> any reason why ?
[12:40:04] <wa5ted> event.stopPropogation
[12:40:23] <dolphone> wa5ted, i think you are right. i forget it every time
[12:40:49] <wa5ted> dolphone: np
[12:42:17] <guideX> hmm idk, .on isn't working the same, and i've commented all stoppropigations
[12:42:25] <guideX> any other ideas?
[12:43:30] <faianca> wa5ted: guess we need the forcePlaceholderSize, let me try a workaround
[12:43:44] <wa5ted> lol you do that
[12:44:20] <wa5ted> faianca: tbh i might not use it in the end (its for a project) but i when i build projects like these i want to explore every corner
[12:44:39] <wa5ted> and if there is an issue figuring outwhy
[12:47:00] <guideX> I don't understand why if I am doing $("body").live("keypress", "li" ... shouldn't I get the li?
[12:48:35] <guideX> also the official selector doesn't work gah.. $(document).on('keypress', 'form.custom div.custom.dropdown li', function (event) {
[12:51:58] <faianca> wa5ted: he is going over top, floating outside of the box, so we can't see it, 1 sec
[12:52:19] <wa5ted> faianca: np i got lots of time
[12:52:38] <visua> waiting to hear back from the flare lightbox dudes
[12:56:25] <faianca> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/5/ well at least you got a start, it's all about css mate
[12:57:36] <wa5ted_> faianca: i didnt lose you (sry my connection got reset)
[12:57:48] <faianca> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/5/ well at least you got a start, it's all about css mate
[12:58:47] <wa5ted> faianca: but doesnt that mean that the placeholder "isnt working"
[12:59:00] <wa5ted> is there any way to do like ui.placeholder.css()
[12:59:10] <benth> i have a draggable within an overflow: scroll container and i'd like to autoscroll when the draggable is near the edge. how can i do this?
[13:02:33] <faianca> wa5ted: yes you can
[13:02:41] <wa5ted> i tried that
[13:03:04] <wa5ted> maybe i was doign somethign wrong
[13:03:28] <faianca> wa5ted: just do this
[13:03:37] <faianca> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/6/
[13:03:40] <faianca> change it to floats
[13:03:51] <faianca> float the placeholder as well
[13:03:54] <faianca> just work
[13:03:58] <faianca> should work*
[13:04:42] <guideX> anything wrong with this for binding to a keyup even of dynamic ul li list? http://jsfiddle.net/j2vND/
[13:05:19] <guideX> also what's the difference between $("body").on("keyup", 'form.custom div.custom.dropdown a.selector', function (e) {  and  $("body").on("keyup", function (e) {  they both seem to work the same?
[13:05:43] <guideX> in fact, I can remove the real selector (the form.custom ... ) and put blah there and it'll still work
[13:06:47] <faianca> guidex .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
[13:07:08] <faianca> and, A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event. If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element.
[13:07:20] <faianca> guideX: http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handlereventObject
[13:07:38] <guideX> oic ok thanks
[13:08:55] <wa5ted> faianca: hold up
[13:09:21] <faianca> my fiddle should fix your problems up
[13:10:49] <wa5ted> faianca: im trying to copy some of the stuff in your fiddle
[13:10:54] <wa5ted> did you mod the css by any chance?
[13:11:00] <wa5ted> beyond the .red class
[13:11:10] <faianca> .column
[13:11:12] <faianca> to float:left
[13:11:13] <wa5ted> okay
[13:11:14] <faianca> as well
[13:12:50] <wa5ted> faianca: i got an issue hold
[13:14:08] <wa5ted> faianca: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/7/
[13:14:18] <wa5ted> ^ i need to get those all in 1 line
[13:15:13] <faianca> make it responsive is harder :P
[13:15:36] <faianca> in fiddle, if you bring your html window, grab it and bring it to the left, it will become all in one line tho
[13:16:33] <wa5ted> well the issue im having is that the data needs to be in "one line" meaning it cant be like in the fiddle
[13:16:42] <wa5ted> im experimenting with display: inlne-block
[13:16:49] <wa5ted> but that also is giving me weird behaviour
[13:17:04] <faianca> just try
[13:17:07] <faianca> .column
[13:17:12] <faianca>  max-width:200px;  overflow-x:hidden;
[13:17:18] <wa5ted> i wnat to put the actual data that I am using but I cant (1 because its not my data and its private and 2. its huge)
[13:17:27] <faianca> w/e, it's all css or html, no more problem with jquery anymore
[13:17:53] <faianca> or make it just max-width, and break line w/e so many options
[13:18:03] <wa5ted> :P
[13:18:31] <wa5ted> okay that solves the one lne issue but now the content wont scroll
[13:18:38] <wa5ted> i want to be able to see the data
[13:18:41] <wa5ted> sry im being demanding
[13:18:47] <wa5ted> i feel bad :(
[13:18:54] <faianca> ahah np
[13:20:29] <wa5ted> so ya
[13:20:44] <wa5ted> im still not able to get it right
[13:21:24] <faianca> ok, i will show you just one way
[13:21:42] <wa5ted> see if i use display: inlin-block for .red and .coulumn
[13:21:49] <wa5ted> it works but there is a margin at the top
[13:21:52] <wa5ted> which is undesireable
[13:25:51] <rmill> wa5ted: `vertical-align: top;`
[13:26:17] <wa5ted> rmill: colum or placeholder
[13:26:47] <wa5ted> faianca: rmill nailed it
[13:27:09] * rmill takes a bow
[13:27:25] <faianca> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/6J2a9/9/
[13:27:35] * wa5ted starts to pray "all hail the mighty rmill" :P
[13:27:48] <wa5ted> faianca: what you add?
[13:28:02] <faianca> lousy hack on the tableupdate
[13:28:08] <wa5ted> what you mean lusy
[13:28:11] <wa5ted> *lousy
[13:28:11] <faianca> you can do many other ways
[13:28:36] <faianca> nasty etc...
[13:28:37] <faianca> u get it
[13:28:37] <wa5ted> faianca: that is changing very soon
[13:28:42] <wa5ted> yup
[13:28:55] <wa5ted> rmill: is like a little angel watching over the problem hahha
[13:29:20] <rmill> I didn't even look at the fiddle
[13:29:40] <rmill> just saw "inline-block" and "undesirable margin at the top"
[13:30:06] <faianca> wa5ted: fits your needs?
[13:30:20] <wa5ted> rmill: lol
[13:30:21] <faianca> you have loads to change there, but you got one idea now
[13:30:23] <faianca> where to start
[13:30:35] <wa5ted> faianca: what?
[13:30:51] <faianca> better if you remake your entire code and do it properly :P
[13:31:01] <faianca> but if this works for you, go on
[13:31:07] <wa5ted> what you mean remake
[13:31:16] <wa5ted> cause of the messy tableUpdate?
[13:31:22] <faianca> nah
[13:31:30] <faianca> i mean the html and css
[13:31:36] <wa5ted> true
[13:31:47] <wa5ted> what would you do (in concept and theory)
[13:32:08] <faianca> no idea, i would not use sortables anyway
[13:32:41] <wa5ted> lol i guess i could have used some html5 api
[13:32:47] <wa5ted> but i need to finish this
[13:33:10] <faianca> so its finished
[13:33:24] <wa5ted> well the sorting bit yes
[13:33:28] <faianca> lol :P
[13:33:43] <wa5ted> now next task: getting tree table setup
[13:33:48] <wa5ted> this is the harder bit
[13:35:34] <wa5ted> i guess some sort of dynamic class based strucutre would be the approach ?
[13:36:36] <faianca> whatever fits your needs
[13:36:55] <faianca> i'm off, being away for a bit
[13:37:19] <wa5ted> faianca: ??/
[14:03:36] <pacmanfan> blah, i cannot lick this jquery ui position problem
[14:03:53] <pacmanfan> yesterday we determined that my code worked fine in jsfiddle
[14:04:08] <pacmanfan> so i am thinking it is a conflict with prototype...
[14:13:14] <wa5ted> pacmanfan: lick?
[14:13:43] <NoiseEee> pacmanfan: one should ask "why would I need two javascript libraries?"
[14:14:48] <pacmanfan> wa5ted, http://jsfiddle.net/68au2/
[14:14:55] <pacmanfan> and live: http://engraveacrete.com/shop/stain-test.html
[14:16:23] <wa5ted> hmmmmm
[14:16:34] <wa5ted> I think something may be wrong with how the tiles are set
[14:16:35] <pacmanfan> see the issue on the live site?
[14:16:37] <wa5ted> on the live site
[14:16:45] <wa5ted> the tooltip is going all over the place?
[14:16:49] <pacmanfan> yep
[14:17:01] <pacmanfan> due to using a class maybe?
[14:17:03] <wa5ted> check those tiles
[14:17:20] <wa5ted> i have a feeling they have been treated with a float: left and the tooltip may not like this
[14:17:36] <pacmanfan> hmm
[14:17:44] <wa5ted> pacmanfan: i suspect a float left
[14:17:44] <pacmanfan> so position doesn't work right...
[14:17:48] <wa5ted> though im not certain
[14:17:54] <wa5ted> position?
[14:17:57] <wa5ted> ya i guess
[14:18:01] <wa5ted> again im speculating
[14:18:18] <pacmanfan> the images themselves are not floated left, but their parent div is
[14:19:04] <wa5ted> ya that may be an issue
[14:19:07] <wa5ted> what i would do
[14:19:12] <wa5ted> is set parent width
[14:19:20] <wa5ted> and then add br tags after each image
[14:20:00] <pacmanfan> the parent div is fixed width.
[14:20:25] <wa5ted> hmmm
[14:20:36] <pacmanfan> br tags won't work, since in the end the tiles on the right will be a double column
[14:20:57] <pacmanfan> right now it's just whitespace that's making it single column
[14:21:08] <pacmanfan> once i'm done with my code i will remove the whitespaces
[14:21:25] <wa5ted> well try to remove white space and see if the problem persists (im just guessing)
[14:21:47] <pacmanfan> NoiseEee actually has a really good point, i should be using prototype
[14:22:18] <pacmanfan> i'm using jquery because i prefer it a little more, but prototype is fixed on this site and jquery is optional, sooo...
[14:22:38] <pacmanfan> i just hate to throw away my work
[14:27:26] <Agamemnus> Has anyone used or does use fancybox?
[14:27:45] <Agamemnus> I have something I want to share. . .
[14:32:10] <Agamemnus> tough crowd
[14:33:42] <duch_kazatel> I've used fancybox.
[14:35:40] <Agamemnus> okay
[14:35:45] <Agamemnus> so here is my thing
[14:35:59] <Agamemnus> http://jsfiddle.net/B77hB/
[14:36:05] <Agamemnus> the first 2 functions are ancillary
[14:36:58] <duch_kazatel> the scroll fix?
[14:37:00] <Agamemnus> so, what this does is
[14:37:14] <Agamemnus> say you have a page with scrollbars
[14:37:23] <Agamemnus> it hides the scrollbars
[14:37:27] <Agamemnus> then it adds them back
[14:37:41] <Agamemnus> and when it does this, the page doesn't change in appearance
[14:37:54] <duch_kazatel> hah we actually swapped to using jqModal because of all the extra effort these things take.
[14:38:01] <Agamemnus> because i add a margin to the body
[14:38:21] <Agamemnus> the only problem with that is if your body had margins
[14:38:26] <Agamemnus> but come on
[14:38:41] <Agamemnus> Well, dynamic margins
[14:39:06] <duch_kazatel> why not just set "overflow: hidden;" on the body?
[14:39:21] <Agamemnus> that will change the flow of the page
[14:39:24] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah i get it.
[14:39:25] <duch_kazatel> derp
[14:39:33] <Agamemnus> (for centered elements)
[14:39:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's right.
[14:39:49] <Agamemnus> it's not perfect if you're like using rems in the body margin
[14:39:56] <Agamemnus> but i suppose it can be changed to calc()
[14:39:58] <duch_kazatel> right 0 your setup seems fine.
[14:40:01] <Agamemnus> even then it's not perfect
[14:40:14] <Agamemnus> but will work for most sites
[14:40:22] <Agamemnus> I use it on the flower site.
[14:40:34] <Agamemnus> http://www.theflowerabode.com/
[14:40:49] <Agamemnus> click a painting or the contact from to see
[14:40:51] <Agamemnus> form*
[14:41:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah your method seems sane.
[14:41:22] <Agamemnus> Ok, now I need to monetize it
[14:41:24] <Agamemnus> and make $$$$$$$$
[14:41:30] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[14:42:10] <jsstoni> hello
[14:43:06] <Agamemnus> hello
[14:44:35] <Agamemnus> jqModal has some nice features
[14:44:53] <Agamemnus> I see a lot of sites using Fancybox 2 though.
[14:44:55] <Agamemnus> A LOT
[14:44:55] <duch_kazatel> i personally prefer it.
[14:50:09] <Agamemnus> i'm pretty sure USA today stole the cide
[14:50:10] <Agamemnus> code
[14:51:48] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:53:43] <Agamemnus> for their modals
[14:53:53] <Agamemnus> do you work for USA Today?
[14:54:09] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:54:10] <duch_kazatel> nope
[15:18:00] <wa5ted> can anyone show me example of how I can insert a string into an array of strings at a particular index
[15:29:21] <_rgn> wa5ted: splice
[15:30:06] <wa5ted> ya just figured that out thatnks
[15:42:08] <lablayers> Is there a performance-friendly alternative to $(window).scroll?
[15:44:01] <duch_kazatel> "performance-friendly"?  proof $(window).scroll isn't
[15:44:02] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:47:22] <wa5ted> lol
[15:47:32] <lablayers> It adds/removes class on visible elements
[15:47:38] <lablayers> Here, gimme a sec -
[15:50:10] <duch_kazatel> wat.  that doesn't sound right at all.
[15:50:22] <lablayers> I'm upload the screenshots right now
[15:51:57] <lablayers> With window.scroll, most of the time rendering the page is spent on scripting (yellow) instead of actual rendering/painting (green/purple) and the framerate drops significantly http://i.imgur.com/iZYVcCX.png
[15:52:25] <lablayers> On the other hand, here is normal scrolling without the window.scroll script http://i.imgur.com/TtsfncI.png
[15:52:49] <lablayers> See the big difference?
[15:53:33] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing any of your code?
[15:54:00] <duch_kazatel> because while watching the scroll can be expensive, it shouldn't be that bad.
[15:54:39] <lablayers> Yes, open Chrome Dev tools > Timeline > Frames > Record and notice how half the time rendering the page is based on scripting http://codepen.io/anon/pen/lLsef
[15:54:48] <lablayers> Then remove the javascript and try scrolling again
[15:55:13] <duch_kazatel> holy christ - lines 25-34 are inefficient.
[15:55:35] <lablayers> Is there a better way to do this? :/
[15:56:15] <duch_kazatel> first, $("section, header, footer").each(function(i, el) { - that's expensive to begin with.
[15:57:10] <duch_kazatel> you're probably iterating through every element on the page every time the scroll event fires.  that's really slow.
[15:57:18] <duch_kazatel> why are you adding/removing a visible class?
[15:57:21] <lablayers> Ah, I see
[15:57:25] <lablayers> It's for CSS animations
[15:57:46] <lablayers> Pretty much different things flying in when a section is visible
[15:58:08] <duch_kazatel> http://www.artofflightmovie.com/
[15:58:11] <duch_kazatel> take a look at that.
[15:58:22] <duch_kazatel> that uses some animating.
[15:58:31] <duch_kazatel> propably similar to what you're doing.
[15:59:56] <Cyclohexane> Is there a way of checking if something exists before running it? e.g. $('#id').something() but #id doesn't exist so I don't want it to run
[16:00:18] <duch_kazatel> Cyclohexane if ($('#id').length > 0)
[16:00:22] <lablayers> ^
[16:00:32] <duch_kazatel> Cyclohexane OR if ($('#id').length !== 0)
[16:00:34] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[16:00:36] <duch_kazatel> you get the idea.
[16:00:39] <lablayers> Here
[16:01:00] <lablayers> That site uses jQuery for animations... :/
[16:01:02] <lablayers> Here's another example of what I'm trying to accomplish: http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/DjmJe
[16:01:25] <lablayers> I think that may be the code that I'm looking for
[16:01:59] <duch_kazatel> do you see the basic difference in that new version you sent?
[16:02:40] <lablayers> Actually, nevermind - most of the rendering is based on scripting too
[16:02:59] <duch_kazatel> but do you see the difference that makes it more efficient?
[16:03:18] <duch_kazatel> it's reducing the amount of lookups it has to do on scroll
[16:03:34] <duch_kazatel> it's caching things before it hits the scroll so you aren't going through the document as much.
[16:04:41] <xLeqend> hello there
[16:05:10] <xLeqend> i have a small problem.. can someone help me
[16:05:11] <duch_kazatel> goood afternoon.
[16:05:12] <xLeqend> ?
[16:05:18] <duch_kazatel> sure, do you have code?
[16:08:53] <xLeqend> im using jquery mobile and my question is :i have a <input type="checkbox"... and i would like next to it a selector for a date but at the moment ist the selector under the checkbox but that isnt very nice... for me. sorry for the bad englisch im from germany :pp
[16:09:41] <duch_kazatel> please supply an example in jsfiddle.
[16:09:58] <xLeqend> okay one moment
[16:11:25] <lablayers> Thanks :)
[16:12:04] <duch_kazatel> lablayers does that help you understand the idea?
[16:12:14] <lablayers> Yes, I understand what you're talking about
[16:12:51] <duch_kazatel> also consider using the native javascript object iterator for...in loop instead of the jquery each.
[16:16:00] <xLeqend> http://www.myimg.de/?img=plsd65a8.png http://pastebin.com/vQAYUvaV - is that so okay? do you know, know what i mean?
[16:19:38] <xLeqend>  +
[16:20:42] <guideX> how do I scroll a ul li list?
[16:20:56] <guideX> i'm trying like this, but for some reason it isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/qKGv8/
[16:21:11] <guideX> all of the items end up in the same position for me
[16:21:44] <duch_kazatel> guideX that's doing what you want it to for me.
[16:21:49] <AlexR> ditto
[16:22:00] <xLeqend> yeah
[16:22:01] <guideX> it is for thart gy
[16:22:03] <guideX> guy
[16:22:18] <guideX> but on my page ul li lists, it isn't working, here's my version.. $(this).animate({ 'margin-top': 0 - $(this).position().top })
[16:22:23] <guideX> where this is the li list
[16:23:06] <guideX> for me, all items end up in the same spot
[16:23:09] <guideX> all li's
[16:23:13] <guideX> they all overlap :(
[16:23:34] <AlexR> you mean the css is wrong?
[16:24:03] <guideX> yeah maybe.. when I do it, the items scroll as they should, except all items seem to be in the position of 0
[16:24:10] <guideX> I'm not really sure why..
[16:24:29] <guideX> like the top of all li items changes to 0 for me in my ul li list
[16:24:36] <guideX> or so it looks
[16:25:43] <guideX> is there perhaps another way to do it?
[16:28:03] <AlexR> guideX: kinda hard to help without actually seeing your problem.  That fiddle you gave us actually works correctly
[16:28:29] <AlexR> It's obviously something else in your code, but since I can't see it, I can't really help you
[16:37:46] <Jackboy> Hey guys, I've got an event firing twice, any suggestions on how to debug? I've never come across anything like this before.
[16:39:59] <guideX> I guess this was all I need... liTotalHeight = liTotalHeight + $(this).outerHeight(); and ... $(this).parent().scrollTop(liTotalHeight);
[16:40:21] <jphase> Jackboy: usually that's when an event is bound twice. Check where your events are being bound and see if there's a possibility that whatever function it's wrapped in is firing twice perhaps.
[16:40:23] <wa5ted> Jackboy: look into event.stopPropogation()
[16:40:23] <guideX> crazy how easy it is :))
[16:40:43] <jphase> ahh, could be bubbling too
[16:41:00] <Jackboy> Hmm. It's wrapped inside animate -> fadeOut -> fadeIn
[16:41:27] <guideX> thanks for trying though :))
[16:41:46] <Jackboy> stopPropogation didn't work :(
[16:43:01] <Jackboy> jphase, waSted: I have $('html, body').animate({
[16:43:09] <Jackboy> I wonder if they fire 2 callbacks? It would make sense.
[16:43:25] <jphase> Jackboy: that's two different elements
[16:43:48] <Jackboy> Let me take that out and try, 2secs
[16:44:18] <wa5ted> np Jackboy
[16:44:29] <wa5ted> jphase: are you too busy for an interesting problem?
[16:44:44] <Jackboy> BLISS. Thank you chaps!!
[16:44:49] <wa5ted> np
[16:44:50] <jphase> aye aye
[16:45:24] <jphase> wa5ted: if by interesting you mean time consuming, then yes
[16:45:30] <jphase> :)
[16:46:09] <wa5ted> jphase: i can assure you it is time consuming
[16:46:13] <wa5ted> check your PM
[16:46:20] <wa5ted> and dont badger me about load time
[16:48:17] <jphase> by treetable you mean nested?
[16:48:22] <wa5ted> yes
[16:48:38] <jphase> and what determines the children?
[16:48:58] <wa5ted> well each object in the array of data has a parent
[16:49:03] <wa5ted> with a name
[16:49:15] <jphase> is the array nested?
[16:49:26] <wa5ted> that name is the exact one that is used in the parent's name key for the parent's object
[16:49:30] <wa5ted> see the data array
[16:49:49] <wa5ted> (also the parent's are dynamically generated
[16:50:23] <jphase> well it'd be much better if this was a keyed array with the names
[16:50:34] <wa5ted> what you mean?
[16:50:42] <wa5ted> like "foreign key"
[16:50:47] <jphase> you're going to face a lot of latency with the name being part of the child object since you'll have to loop through each index in the array and check this.name type thing
[16:50:54] <jphase> as opposed to data[name]
[16:51:10] <wa5ted> true
[16:51:20] <jphase> you have the ability to reorganize the data/
[16:51:23] <wa5ted> is there any way I can map them
[16:51:32] <wa5ted> reorganize
[16:51:36] <wa5ted> show me
[16:51:37] <jphase> well yeah, loop through the array and rebuild, that's about the only way
[16:51:40] <jphase> then you only loop once
[16:51:45] <wa5ted> true
[16:51:49] <wa5ted> its a lot of db
[16:51:51] <wa5ted> *data
[16:51:53] <wa5ted> i mean
[16:51:57] <wa5ted> show me what your thinking
[16:52:26] <jphase> well, it's literally just a for in and append values onto a new array with the key of the array being the .name prop of that object
[16:52:48] <jphase> var newArray = [];   (for in loop goes here and appends this.name as key of new array)
[16:52:51] <jphase> type thing
[16:53:00] <wa5ted> can you show me an example a smaller one
[16:53:08] <jphase> I'd put on jsfiddle but it's sensitive data
[16:53:17] <wa5ted> well thats the thing
[16:53:20] <jphase> hmm
[16:53:24] <wa5ted> its publically available
[16:53:30] <jphase> oh
[16:53:35] <wa5ted> i just dont want to get in trouble from the people im working for
[16:53:35] <jphase> then it's not sensitive at all lol
[16:53:47] <jphase> if it's public, then you can't get in trouble
[16:53:50] <wa5ted> cause the particular application this has is still a secret
[16:53:56] <wa5ted> i guess
[16:53:59] <wa5ted> okay ya show me
[16:54:03] <jphase> well w/e, sec
[16:54:10] <wa5ted> sure
[17:22:48] <guideX> anyone know how to manually tell jquery custom forms 1.0 (select list) that I want to change the selected item?
[17:23:22] <guideX> say I know what it is by text
[17:23:42] <guideX> with jquery chosen, I might call the .trigger('change') or something
[17:23:48] <guideX> i'm not sure how to do it here.
[17:38:09] <guideX> know what to do about this? "The Web Console logging API (console.log, console.info, console.warn, console.error) has been disabled by a script on this page."
[18:10:48] <gordian> guys i have a few .js files on my site and i'm running into an issue with some elements where i've used click() and slideUp()–some elements slide up then drop back down and slide up again
[18:11:03] <gordian> i removed all of my *custom* scripts and that seems to solve it
[18:11:22] <gordian> but i need to find out where in my custom scripts things are going wrong
[18:11:34] <gordian> is there anyway to debug and figure it out in Chrome?
[18:11:42] <gordian> or do i need a more sophisticated debugger?
[18:16:27] <boze> how could i call this function I made? $.fn.onloadFunction = function ()  {...}  $.onloadFunction() doesn't do it :(
[18:17:09] <gordian> ok, kill myself
[18:17:32] <gordian> custom.js was being grunted and uglified twice into the same scripts.min.js
[18:26:56] <gordian> boze: you would do $(<SELECTOR>).onloadFunction();
[18:27:36] <boze> gordian: tyvm, but I just wana run the function with no selector. kinda weird right?
[18:28:27] <gordian> boze: try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5764217/creating-custom-jquery-function-without-selector-prerequisite
[18:28:47] <gordian> vote up the answer if it works
[18:28:54] <boze> actually, it works just running it with an empty selector $().onloadFunction; I wonder if thats bad
[18:28:57] * boze looks
[18:41:26] <tables> http://ws.spotify.com/search/1/album.json?q=foo   <-- how do i load a json like this from jquery and then parse it?
[18:41:32] <tables> i need to load the url
[18:41:57] <Velveeta> you can use $.getJSON
[18:42:04] <Velveeta> `api getjson @tables
[18:42:05] <b-ot> tables: No matches.
[18:42:17] <Velveeta> `jquery.getjson @tables
[18:42:26] <Velveeta> damnit :D
[18:42:36] <Velveeta> `api jquery.getjson @tables
[18:42:37] <b-ot> tables: jQuery.getJSON(): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/

[18:45:02] <wa5ted> hahahahahaha
[19:31:06] <scanlonman> Hey everyone, I have an element on my page but I can't find out how to get it via jQuery's $() syntax.  Is there a tool I can use to find the DOM path to it?
[19:31:57] <scanlonman> It's the items in Bootstrap's navbar if anyone is curious.  My current attempt is $(".navbar-default .navbar-nav li a") which is pretty gross and doesn't work
[19:37:14] <shoky> scanlonman: what doesn't work about it?
[19:38:10] <scanlonman> Not returning anything :(
[19:43:05] <s2013> http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/3/ can someone help me out with this? its hiding the wrong div
[19:43:18] <s2013> if you click on the title it should toggle the description
[19:43:26] <s2013> but for some reason its toggling the title itself
[19:44:41] <shoky> scanlonman: seems to find many items here http://jsfiddle.net/MPwWz/
[19:45:12] <shoky> s2013: .closest searches UP the dom
[19:46:10] <scanlonman> Hmmm, weird!  Thank you. I probably have to debug elsewhere
[19:47:45] <s2013> shoky: ok so how would i do it? i tried next
[19:47:48] <s2013> does the same thing
[19:48:13] <s2013> should i use children
[19:48:29] <shoky> s2013: .closest('.step').find('.desc')
[19:48:55] <s2013> ok
[19:50:15] <s2013_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/7/
[19:50:18] <Velveeta> i tried a .closest('article').find('.desc'), which eis essentially the same thing
[19:50:24] <Velveeta> but it's still hiding the title for some reason
[19:50:28] <s2013_> yeah its so odd
[19:50:32] <shoky> Velveeta: yeah he has javascript in his html too
[19:50:38] <Velveeta> ahaaaa
[19:50:38] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/8/
[19:50:49] <shoky> but.. he also has * {  -webkit-transition: all 0.25s ease; ... }
[19:51:01] <s2013_> what did you change
[19:51:03] <shoky> that does not go well together with a jquery slide animation ;]
[19:51:17] <shoky> s2013_: i removed the junk you had in your HTML window
[19:51:22] <shoky> including a <script>
[19:51:53] <Velveeta> yeah there we go
[19:51:56] <shoky> s2013_: and now without that transition.. http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/10/
[19:52:28] <Velveeta> shoky: have you done much work with designing restful api's?
[19:52:40] <s2013_> Velveeta: i can hlep with your q about that
[19:52:43] <s2013_> im not a front end person
[19:52:46] <Velveeta> sweet
[19:52:49] <s2013_> but i do a lot of backend
[19:52:51] <shoky> not much, Velveeta
[19:53:09] <Velveeta> so i'm ground-upping a restful api, but before i get into actual controller setup, i want to decide how to handle authentication in the request
[19:53:22] <s2013_> so shoky for the most recent one you removed the webkit trnasition?
[19:53:39] <shoky> Velveeta ah, i'm definitely not your guy for that ;p
[19:53:40] <Velveeta> i looked into oauth and oauth2, but they seem to be tailored more for allowing services to access other services on a user's behalf, than standard authentication tokens for logging in and whatnot
[19:53:50] <s2013_> Velveeta: you can roll custom authentication
[19:54:02] <s2013_> have an api key generated. i usually do a base64 of random stirng
[19:54:06] <shoky> s2013_: i removed the * transition yeah
[19:54:10] <Velveeta> i'll probably just be using a standard Authentication: custom header
[19:54:26] <Velveeta> yeah, from what i read, a common pattern is that header w/ the username:password combo base64'd
[19:54:38] <Velveeta> seems like that'd be vulnerable to mitm attacks though
[19:54:48] <Velveeta> so i guess i'd have to ssl every authenticated request
[19:54:58] <s2013_> Velveeta: generate an api key
[19:55:02] <s2013_> and a token
[19:55:07] <s2013_> make sure both matches
[19:55:25] <s2013_> so i essentially generate 2 encrypted random string
[19:55:28] <shoky> our webapp at work can probabl be hacked in 30 seconds if someone would actually try ;S
[19:55:37] <Velveeta> shoky: heheheh
[19:55:47] <s2013_> and in the db make sure both are store
[19:55:56] <s2013_> which language are you using for the backend?
[19:56:12] <Velveeta> s2013_: so how do you associate those with a particular user? just log them to some session table or something similar, w/ the user key? and use the generated key and secret as lookups?
[19:56:19] <Velveeta> it's on a nodejs backend
[19:57:03] <s2013_> whats the usecase
[19:57:36] <Velveeta> typical saas site, but i'm trying to design it w/ an eye for public consumption by 3rd parties in the future, from the outset
[19:57:36] <s2013_> is it an api for mobile app?
[19:57:48] <Velveeta> it'll be for both mobile and desktop usage
[19:57:50] <s2013_> shoky: why does the transition mess up the js
[19:58:06] <Velveeta> so it'll be strictly json responses, and let the client interpret and render the data
[19:58:07] <s2013_> ok Velveeta what you need to do is basically when a user is created, they automatically have keys associated with them
[19:58:13] <s2013_> and store that upon user creation
[19:58:22] <s2013_> just pick random string and encode them to base64
[19:58:27] <Velveeta> so that wouldn't be something unique to each logged-in authentication?
[19:58:34] <s2013_> it would be
[19:58:43] <shoky> s2013_ cause jquery doesn't know the transition is there, so it keeps changing the height of the element and the transition keeps animating that with 'ease' mode
[19:58:45] <s2013_> no one will have the same key
[19:58:49] <shoky> er, easing ?
[19:58:50] <s2013_> gotcha
[19:59:03] <Velveeta> right, but the key would be unchanging from the time they logged in
[19:59:06] <Velveeta> er, created
[19:59:24] <s2013_> what do you mean unchanging?
[19:59:28] <Velveeta> as opposed to expiring, in case someone sniffed it at some point and tried to use it in the future
[19:59:33] <s2013_> you can set it to expire
[19:59:36] <s2013_> and you should
[19:59:40] <Velveeta> yeah i think i would
[19:59:41] <s2013_> also they can generate new keys
[20:00:01] <Velveeta> yeah i think i like this idea
[20:00:16] <s2013_> and also for the authentication you can have htem pass a key on the request
[20:01:11] <Velveeta> i'll probably check for authentication data in the request, and failing that request, force them to login, and on login, create a hash of some kind, and probably even associate their current IP with it in a session table, and then return the hash to them to use in future requests
[20:01:22] <s2013_> yeah
[20:01:25] <s2013_> do that
[20:01:28] <Velveeta> and then validate that on each request, and if the validation fails at any time (or expires) force them to login again
[20:01:34] <s2013_> yep
[20:01:39] <Velveeta> sweet, thanks
[20:01:41] <s2013_> np
[20:01:52] <s2013_> i create apis all the time for work and personal project
[20:01:59] <s2013_> but it can be confusing at first
[20:02:33] <Velveeta> yeah this is a personal project of my own, i'm trying to get all of the skeleton in place so i can get to the actual fleshing out of the controllers and start figuring out what kinds of requests i actually need to make
[20:02:53] <s2013_> http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[20:02:57] <s2013_> oops
[20:03:19] <s2013_> cool
[20:06:02] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/1/    <-- why doesn't this work?
[20:06:44] <shoky> tables: no span ?
[20:06:59] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/2/
[20:07:01] <Velveeta> heheh yep
[20:08:34] <s2013_> i do have another uestion regarding charts
[20:08:53] <s2013_> the chart accepts data.. but i fi want to dynamically provide data via json.. how would i do that? i would need to use ajax?
[20:09:21] <s2013_> http://jsbin.com/uqawig/441/embed?javascript,live for example there
[20:11:47] <Velveeta> s2013_: yes, you'd want to send an ajax request to fetch your json data to feed to the map, and do that feeding in the success callback
[20:11:56] <s2013_> oh ok
[20:11:58] <Velveeta> the callback will receive the response json
[20:11:58] <s2013_> thought so. thanks
[20:12:10] <Velveeta> so within that, you just feed it to Morris.Line() or whatever you're using
[20:12:22] <s2013_> gotcha
[20:12:36] <s2013_> shoky: how do i achieve the same hover easing effect ?
[20:13:34] <Velveeta> s2013_: are you talking about having those descriptions hidden by default and stretching open on hover?
[20:13:35] <shoky> s2013_: you can still use transitions, just don't use them on ALL elements, and/or not for ALL properties
[20:13:47] <s2013_> Velveeta: no when you hover over the #s
[20:13:59] <shoky> but uh, if you're using transitions, why use a slideToggle ?
[20:14:07] <shoky> just toggleClass instead
[20:14:33] <Velveeta> you could potentially just move it all out to css as well, with a :hover, if you're just wanting hover functionality vs click
[20:15:30] <s2013_> slidetoggle for the description/text
[20:15:35] <s2013_> trastion for the #s
[20:15:37] <s2013_> like 1, 2, 3 etc
[20:15:52] <s2013_> http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/8/ if you hover over hte #
[20:15:54] <s2013_> youll see what i mean
[20:17:20] <coldhead> s2013_++
[20:17:37] <s2013_> .step-num:hover {
[20:17:39] <s2013_>  i did that
[20:17:41] <s2013_> coldhead: ?
[20:17:53] <s2013_> http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/15/
[20:18:03] <s2013_> does that look about right
[20:19:07] <Velveeta> s2013_: here's an example of how you can migrate it all to css: http://jsfiddle.net/vey5V/17/
[20:19:25] <Velveeta> the transition timing isn't working properly yet, but that uses just a css hover to trigger it
[20:19:45] <s2013_> thanks
[20:20:04] <Velveeta> let me see if i can make the transition actually work properly
[20:20:07] <s2013_> if you want multiple items to have the same effect, is there an easier way to do it than multiple steps
[20:20:10] <s2013_> Velveeta: its fine i got it. thanks man
[20:20:15] <Velveeta> alrighty
[20:20:18] <s2013_> i mean multiple copy & paste
[20:20:47] <Velveeta> i'm not sure i understand the question, can you gimme an example?
[20:21:15] <s2013_> so lets say on a:hover and .my_link:hover and .someclass:hover i want the color to change to blue
[20:21:21] <s2013_> do i need to declare it individually?
[20:22:43] <shoky> .blue:hover
[20:22:46] <Velveeta> you don't *need* to, you would just have to specify something abstract that you could add to each
[20:22:51] <Velveeta> right, like that
[20:23:13] <Velveeta> and then in that case, you could add a 'blue' class to each item you wanted to have that behavior
[20:23:53] <shoky> dang, forgot that css transitions don't do height:auto to height:number. quite lame
[20:24:11] <codepython777> what am i doing wrong here: <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script> ?
[20:24:28] <coldhead> codepython777: are you loading this via file:/// ?
[20:25:14] <codepython777> coldhead: I tried http:// and // - both give me errors on the console it seems
[20:25:33] <coldhead> http:// should always work
[20:25:40] <s2013_> got it
[20:25:45] <Velveeta> shoky: yeah, i was wondering why my transition time wasn't being respected :D
[20:25:46] <coldhead> but if you use the //: version you need to load it from an actual web server
[20:25:50] <coldhead> localhost or something
[20:26:01] <coldhead> it won't work if you open the file locally with your browser
[20:26:10] <coldhead> what console error are you seeing, codepython777?
[20:26:31] <Velveeta> is the protocol-relative just // or is it :// ?
[20:26:36] <Velveeta> i can't remember
[20:26:58] <coldhead> it's just //, you're right
[20:27:28] <codepython777> coldhead: http://bpaste.net/show/rdatiloXWJUzgNcwvXSD/
[20:27:34] <Velveeta> so i just got an amber alert for the first time on my phone, it freaked me out
[20:27:45] <codepython777> my current script line is : <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
[20:27:50] <Velveeta> do they have those in other places outside of where i live?
[20:28:51] <coldhead> codepython777: that error doesn't seem related to jQuery
[20:29:01] <coldhead> can you paste us your entire HTML
[20:29:05] <Velveeta> codepython777: this isn't for a chrome extension is it?
[20:29:09] <codepython777> coldhead: its not, jquery is defined.
[20:29:24] <shoky> codepython777 is it your site?
[20:29:26] <codepython777> Velveeta: seems like diqus is causing trouble
[20:29:57] <codepython777> http://bit.ly/19GkohV
[20:30:06] <Velveeta> the only references i'm finding to that error are from people trying to use inline scripts in their chrome extensions
[20:31:10] <Velveeta> interesting, yeah, i see that error in my own chrome
[20:31:53] <Velveeta> funnily enough, http://benvinegar.github.io/csp-talk-2013/#1
[20:32:06] <Velveeta> some engineer at disqus seems to have made a presentation based around this
[20:32:31] <Velveeta> and yet, this problem exists in their software :D
[20:33:21] <codepython777> I hope i'm not doing something stupid :)
[20:33:22] <coldhead> disqus has really gone downhill since anton left
[20:33:36] <coldhead> it really looks like it's just a disqus fail
[20:33:40] <Velveeta> codepython777: this seems to be something in their end
[20:33:41] <coldhead> and the code still seems to work
[20:33:59] <Velveeta> this is a bullet point on that guy's presentation: "Once ate 7 McDonald's cheeseburgers in one sitting"
[20:34:15] <Velveeta> pfft, i sit on my ass at a computer for a living, gimme a challenge
[20:34:25] <Velveeta> i could probably polish off 7 of those little things for breakfast
[20:36:27] <codepython777> coldhead: is there a good alternative to disqus?
[20:36:50] <coldhead> i'd stick with disqus
[20:36:56] <coldhead> let them know you're seeing the error
[20:37:01] <codepython777> just did
[20:37:08] <codepython777> thanks
[20:37:11] <coldhead> and they will eventually fix it without your doing anything
[20:37:24] <coldhead> that error doesn't look like it's actually breaking anything
[20:37:24] <codepython777> I was trying to get rid of the div#footer using jquery
[20:37:27] <coldhead> it's just annoying
[20:37:46] <codepython777> $(document).ready(function () {    $("div#footer").hide(); }) -- didnt work
[20:38:24] <coldhead> that won't work because the footer isn't there when the document is "ready"
[20:38:31] <coldhead> it's added at some later time by disqus
[20:38:37] <coldhead> couldn't you just hide that in CSS?
[20:38:44] <coldhead> #footer { display: none } ?
[20:38:49] <codepython777> didnt work
[20:39:00] <codepython777> need to try settimeout
[20:39:07] <coldhead> display: none!important :P
[20:39:19] <coldhead> yes i have also used setInterval polling to wait for things like that
[20:40:03] <codepython777> coldhead: i've not tried that - worth trying?
[20:40:55] <tables> http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/#http://ws.spotify.com/search/1/album.json?q=foo   <-- how do i get the that "Greatest Hits" value and "Foo Fighters" value with json parsing?   they're both "name:" field i think
[20:41:20] <codepython777> coldhead: http://bpaste.net/show/46IR0dd2NvTU1x8nr7OF/ -- didnt work?
[20:43:51] <Velveeta> tables: you have to iterate over the elements in the 'albums' array, and for each of them, you can reference the .name property
[20:44:37] <coldhead> codepython777: i would try something more like http://bpaste.net/show/WIeTnNcOV3UtnjdqdEsY/
[20:45:09] <tables> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/3/    could you fix that code for me?
[20:45:14] <tables> by any chance?
[20:45:23] <tables> so it reads only the name values
[20:45:31] <codepython777> coldhead: If you do $("#footer") in chrome inspection console, it returns []? Is that normal?
[20:45:37] <tables> like how i described
[20:45:48] <coldhead> that suggests your selector is wrong, codepython777
[20:45:55] <tables> i'm not good at jquery, and my code is not working
[20:45:59] <codepython777> coldhead: indeed
[20:46:08] <codepython777> I tried div#footer as well
[20:46:14] <coldhead> codepython777: ah, it's inside an iframe
[20:46:21] <coldhead> so it's not in the same "context" as your JS
[20:46:27] <coldhead> it's within the iframe
[20:46:29] <coldhead> :(
[20:46:31] <Velveeta> tables: well, jsfiddle won't let you make actual ajax requests from it
[20:46:47] <Velveeta> but here's something you can look at to demonstrate how to iterate over that data object and output its contents: http://jsfiddle.net/jdvkn/
[20:47:01] <codepython777> coldhead: so no way i can fix that then?
[20:47:37] <coldhead> some not nice ways to fix it
[20:47:56] <Velveeta> tables: you'll want to move all of that stuff inside of a .done() callback for your request though: http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/4/
[20:48:27] <Velveeta> that getJSON() function is going to continue execution immediately, even though the request is still processing.. you attach a .done() callback to execute your code whenever the request completes
[20:48:36] <Velveeta> so then you have the data available to work with
[20:48:56] <Velveeta> and actually, this is closer to correct: http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/5/
[20:49:41] <Velveeta> oh, what do you know, jsfiddle *does* allow this request
[20:50:21] <Velveeta> tables: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/7kJLB/7/
[20:50:25] <Velveeta> an actual working example
[20:51:27] <coldhead> codepython777: i feel like you could maybe insert a new stylesheet into the disqus iframe which had a rule to hide the footer
[20:52:30] <codepython777> seems like they are generating the iframe using their js code. So one has to poll to see if the iframe has arrived?
[20:52:58] <coldhead> codepython777: i haven't used disqus in a while but supposedly you can login to your discuss account and mess with a "Custom CSS" section
[20:53:04] <coldhead> which would be the nicer way to fix this
[20:53:17] <coldhead> i assume hiding their footer is probably a violation of their terms of service though :P
[20:54:40] <codepython777> coldhead: ah! Forgot to read that carefully. Lets leave it that way then.
[20:56:54] <coldhead> very noble of you
[21:27:03] <Velveeta> anybody here watch archer?
[22:14:46] <oojacoboo> hey guys, looking to setup a global event binding and trying to make as efficient of a selector as possible for this since it's going to be so global....  $("body").on(click, "[click]", function(event) { var method = $(this).attr("click"); });
[22:15:06] <oojacoboo> something along these lines, also would have all the arguments required for the method as data attr
[22:15:13] <oojacoboo> then passing them to the method
[22:15:32] <oojacoboo> anyone have any thoughts on speed, lookups, etc for this
[22:58:05] <ekh> is there a clean way to append "input checkbox" to a "label" and then add also a text to the same label?
[22:58:20] <ekh> result: <label><input>text</label>
[22:59:11] <ekh> i believe $(<label>).append($(<input>)).text(text) won't achieve that, right?
[22:59:26] <Velveeta> $('label').append('<input type="checkbox" /> your text') should work i think
[22:59:34] <Velveeta> if not, you can wrap the text in a span
[22:59:52] <ekh> hmmm, cool thanks
[23:00:54] <Velveeta> yeah looks like just appending '<input type="checkbox" /> your text' works fine
[23:27:18] <hopkins83> Hello!
[23:42:32] <hopkins83> Can someone help me make Selectize (for improved <select> boxes: http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) preserve custom data attributes?
[23:42:35] <hopkins83> Like if my original <select> has `data-something`, it will disappear after Selectize has transformed the <select> into its own: http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/
