[00:38:04] <owizz> Hello, I  have a jquery script that opens menu with <a href=#menu> how can I trigger it with jquery?
[01:03:51] <malorie_> hi. is there a way to save a file to my local filesystem, given my site is on localhost?
[03:24:31] <Web4U> Checkout http://jsfiddle.net/57HjQ/ trying to learn to make a simple tooltip plugin but not going so well
[03:24:35] <Web4U> Anyone got a sec?
[03:26:18] <dwarder> is it ok to have several .on(click) handlers of the same event on the same selector?
[03:26:28] <dwarder> to logicaly separate
[03:26:30] <dwarder> the code
[03:39:08] <emx> is there an event that is fired when css of an element changes?
[03:42:47] <Feel> How I can press enter at the end of textarea content with help of jQuery? http://codepen.io/Feel_codepen/pen/sJjdf/
[03:45:44] <decx> only questioners and no answerers. let'S get cracking. reason will prevail !
[03:51:01] <decx> Web4U http://jsfiddle.net/decx/57HjQ/1/ here's a heads up
[03:51:33] <decx> dwarder you can offset that logic into the eventhandler as well but assigning multiple should work
[03:52:07] <Web4U> decx Exactly what I was trying to accomplish :p
[03:52:11] <decx> emx there isn't, but there is a transitionEnd callback if you use transition somewhere
[03:52:15] <Web4U> How often does jQuery make a new API
[03:52:16] <Web4U> ?
[03:52:28] <emx> decx, k, thanks
[03:53:40] <dwarder> decx: thank you
[03:53:42] <nights> hi
[03:54:04] <nights> im trying to open a new window and put the ajax response json data there
[03:54:14] <nights> in ajax success:
[03:54:14] <nights> var newWindow = window.open("","_blank", "height=300,width=400");
[03:54:18] <nights> newWindow.document.innerHTML = data.result_content;
[03:54:30] <nights> this doesnt work, anyone know why?
[03:55:02] <decx> Feel you can simulate a keypress http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vxCbn
[03:59:18] <decx> Web4U for curiosities' sake here's a version without any javascript http://jsfiddle.net/decx/57HjQ/2/
[04:00:18] <Web4U> decx I've make alot with css and css3 just not a jquery fan so trying to learn what I can :)
[04:00:56] <Web4U> decx,  Very cool though couldn't say I would have done it as well :p
[04:01:03] <decx> well a tooltip plugin is a good start
[04:01:30] <decx> css attr() is only in modern browsers anyway
[04:01:33] <Web4U> decx http://jsfiddle.net/decx/57HjQ/1/
[04:01:35] <Web4U> :p
[04:02:49] <decx> Web4U here's one way to add options and defaults http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eP4dV/8/
[04:04:19] <Web4U> Haha, now that is cool. decx if I may ask. What do you do ?
[04:05:01] <decx> i do $(this)
[04:05:29] <Web4U> ;)
[04:05:30] <decx> well at the moment i do this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zzYqN/
[04:06:18] <Web4U> decx Ok thats cool too I guess haha
[04:06:28] <Web4U> nah kidding pretty awesome man
[04:06:48] <decx> these svg effects are pretty powerful
[04:06:58] <decx> i'm surprised
[04:07:52] <Web4U> decx Is that HTML5 also
[04:07:59] <Web4U> I have been out of the game for a while.
[04:08:25] <decx> using svg effects with css filter is pretty obscure, i have no idea if it's html5 spec
[04:09:45] <decx> it's not
[04:10:16] <Web4U> Yeah i'm reading up on it now
[04:15:28] <RobbingHood> Hey, anyone willing to help me with a problem where the change that my Ajax success function does to my website only lasts for about 1 second? http://pastebin.com/7Qn6G7ej
[04:36:14] <YamakasY> damn my script is not doing that I want
[04:51:16] <Geoff_C> Hello.. does anyone have any ideas why my get() will actaully be happening twice, once before click, once after ---> http://jsbin.com/kerogemo/1/
[04:56:01] <rindolf> Hi all.
[05:40:40] <MikeD_> is there a gotcha for using .getScript() in IE?
[05:47:07] <systemfault> MikeD_: Why would there be?
[05:48:28] <MikeD_> because I'm not getting the expected behavior
[05:48:58] <MikeD_> ... and I usually expect that's an IE problem before it's something I've done completely wrong.
[05:49:09] <MikeD_> esp. since .getScript() is dead simple
[05:52:13] <MikeD_> also, i'm trying to load a script from a file reference instead of an http url
[05:53:18] <MikeD_> i know that's ... not-quite-right... but it's a closed system of citrix + VM's - nothing i can do about it.
[06:23:46] <HiMaX> hello, is this correct way to include one html page into another ? $('#songPage').load('songpage.html');
[06:31:11] <rigneo> hello, i want to put google driving directions on my website, is there a jquery plugin or a tutorial which can teach me how to do it ?
[06:42:20] <decx> rigneo https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-complex
[06:43:24] <decx> maybe rather https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-simple first
[06:55:41] <rigneo> decx: thanks
[07:25:57] <Bernard_> How can I use $("p").html(J); with $("p").html(P); without let them overwrite eachother?
[07:26:38] <Bernard_> In front each of them goes an if-statement so I can't just put the + sign between them
[07:30:25] <erming> Bernard_ you mean that they should append?
[07:30:42] <erming> use .append("") instead of .html("") then
[07:30:53] <erming> (prepend also exists..)
[07:31:16] <systemfault> Also… I hope you’re not using such a dumb selector :P
[07:31:21] <Bernard_> erming: Aha ok, I'll try that, thanks!
[07:31:42] <Bernard_> systemfault: Better use an id right?
[07:32:43] <systemfault> Bernard_: Not necessarily… but not something as “general” as “p” which means, all the paragraphs on the page.
[07:32:57] <Bernard_> systemfault: Yeah, I only had one <p> though :P
[07:34:22] <systemfault> Bernard_: On a web page, you should be able to divide the content by “section”… and your selectors (In both CSS and jQuery) should start with its class/id
[07:35:05] <Bernard_> systemfault: Ok, tanks for the heads up. Gave the paragraph an id and used that id as selector now
[07:35:06] <decx> no, long tail selectors are bad, give context, stay cool
[07:36:21] <systemfault> decx: There’s no context that stands here, “element” is a bad selector no matter what.
[07:37:22] <decx> sure, but $('#parent .child') isnt as nice as $('#parent').find('.child') or its shortform $('.child','#parent')
[07:41:16] <crankharder> can I somehow use .param() to get an object of a form's current attrs/values ?
[07:41:39] <erming> .attr()
[07:42:13] <crankharder> attr takes an arg, i want all of them
[07:42:17] <erming> oh, nvm, you wanted some sort of object
[07:42:19] <systemfault> decx++
[07:42:39] <erming> crankharder hmm.. i think there's something called serialize or something, i'll try to find it
[07:42:49] <crankharder> that returns a string
[07:46:33] <erming> crankharder, i guess you've found the same answers on google as i just did, but it seems you'll have to iterate the inputs and create that object yourself
[07:46:53] <erming> i couldn't find anything native jQuery.. oh well, i tried to help. good luck :>
[07:52:56] <rigneo> anyone knows why the google map is not loading here ?
[07:52:56] <rigneo> http://freerealtorwebsites.com/food/challenges/the-flat-tire-xxl-calzone-food-challenge-10/
[07:53:10] <rigneo> it should be below around that get directions part

[08:09:31] <hesco> is the jshint tool broken at jsfiddle today?
[08:24:28] <TheWhisplab> Does anyone here have any tips on using jQuery migrate? I just upgraded from jQ 1.7.2 to 1.11.0, and I thought that jQuery migrate was supposed to keep all functionality and/or show error messages.
[08:25:03] <TheWhisplab> But my custom JS stuff doesn't seem to be working at all and I'm not getting any error messages from JQ Migrate in the console, excluding the "Logging is active" message
[08:26:17] <TheWhisplab> Oh, nevermind...I accidentally commented out my custom JS file lol
[08:26:19] <TheWhisplab> Let's see if it works
[08:33:41] <hesco> This code:  $('.has_error').ready( function() {  alert('.has_error is ready'); });  alerts even when there is no .has_error class.  I need it to alert ONLY if that class exists on the page.  How might I do that, please?
[08:35:21] <decx> just think about that for a second
[08:35:55] <decx> you can already select stuff, now go that extra step with that in mind
[09:01:39] <duch_kazatel> man this place is hopping today
[09:02:12] <nszceta> for sure
[09:26:02] <waspinator>  I'm having trouble showing a bootstrap-select element inside a qtip2 tooltip. Not sure how to apply the selectpicker function when showing the qtip. right now I have a .on('click') making it work.
[09:26:03] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/zMsqK/2/
[09:28:06] <duch_kazatel> waspinator you might want to fix your external resource urls in there - the bootstrap-select js and css files are 404'ing
[09:28:37] <waspinator> I moved them into jquery, since github doesn't work
[09:28:51] <waspinator> I mean I moved them into jsfiddle
[09:29:32] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/zMsqK/4/
[09:30:50] <duch_kazatel> updated - http://jsfiddle.net/zMsqK/5/
[09:31:03] <duch_kazatel> http://cdnjs.com/ is awesome.
[09:31:24] <hugo_m> http://pastie.org/9097927 <--- if i set a breakpoint on line 29, why does it never stop on that breakpoint when i run the code in the browser?
[09:33:41] <waspinator> duch_kazatel, thanks looks like a useful service. any ideas on applying the selectpicker class .on('show')?
[09:34:04] <duch_kazatel> waspinator i'm looking at the documentation to see what callbacks there are.
[09:34:10] <duch_kazatel> wait is show an event?
[09:35:21] <waspinator> no, just a guess of what it could be. I couldn't find anything useful in the docs, but I
[09:35:41] <waspinator> 'm not very good at searching I find
[09:35:45] <duch_kazatel> onRender is the callback you want.
[09:37:24] <decx> what a glorious hodgepodge of different stuff cobbled together
[09:38:32] <waspinator> it's all jquery isn't it?
[09:42:10] <pcfreak30> Is there any reason why jquery does this? Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://newsite.mannyhandbags.com/index.php?route=account/registercatalog/view/theme/mannyhandbags/stylesheet/jquery-mobile-slide-menu.css
[09:42:38] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 that's... not a jquery problem.
[09:42:47] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to load a css file that doesn't exist at that url.
[09:42:51] <pcfreak30> no
[09:43:11] <pcfreak30> its appending the path to the end if the current url when trying to load
[09:43:23] <pcfreak30> and only happens on jqmobile
[09:43:46] <pcfreak30> catalog/view/theme/mannyhandbags/stylesheet/jquery-mobile-slide-menu.css is a relative path
[09:44:31] <duch_kazatel> right - to the current URL.
[09:45:09] <pcfreak30> im at http://newsite.mannyhandbags.com/index.php?route=account/register, and when navigating it does that
[09:45:29] <pcfreak30> instrad o basing off the folder it bases off the script part of the url
[09:45:50] <pcfreak30> should be http://newsite.mannyhandbags.com/catalog/view/theme/mannyhandbags/stylesheet/jquery-mobile-slide-menu.css
[09:45:50] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 it bases it off the relative path you're giving it...,
[09:45:56] <waspinator> duch_kazatel, I tried using onRender with all the combinations I could think for but couldn't get it to apply the style when the tooltip shows up.
[09:45:57] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/zMsqK/6/
[09:46:17] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: normally using catalog/view/theme/mannyhandbags/stylesheet/jquery-mobile-slide-menu.css on a web page bases from the folder your in
[09:46:28] <pcfreak30> query mobile appends to the full url your at
[09:46:40] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 you need to change the relative path.
[09:47:01] <pcfreak30> The path is correcr
[09:47:09] <pcfreak30> if I access it from source it loada
[09:47:23] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 obviously the path is incorrect if it's 404'ing ;)
[09:47:29] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: geeze
[09:47:37] <pcfreak30> You dont get it
[09:47:37] <pancakes9> http://jsfiddle.net/LBS2a/7/ -- can someone help me figure out why the #total isn't updating when I change the #quant field?
[09:47:46] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 oh okay.

[09:48:00] <hesco> I have code which looks like var foo = $('.some_class');  But when I try to use foo.length(), the console tells me:  Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[09:48:07] <pcfreak30> that from a esktop page works normally
[09:48:08] <hesco> how would I do that please?
[09:48:26] <duch_kazatel> hesco length isn't a function.
[09:48:27] <duch_kazatel> it's a property.
[09:48:34] <pcfreak30> as it accesses t http://newsite.mannyhandbags.com/catalog/view/theme/mannyhandbags/stylesheet/jquery-mobile-slide-menu.cs
[09:48:36] <duch_kazatel> waspinator my guess is that this is something about how the tooltip loads and generates is source.  i have to go do some work, but good luck.
[09:48:42] <pcfreak30> as it should
[09:48:57] <pcfreak30> jquery mobile appends the relative path to your absolute url

[09:50:01] <halt_rrr> anybody knows why it seems like IPs of my ISP are blocked by jquery.com. Because I can't open that site :(. But it opens from another ISP
[09:50:14] <duch_kazatel> pcfreak30 the issue is that you're confused about how relative paths work - i'm seeing the css file resolve relative to the current url.
[09:50:30] <halt_rrr> What black list they are using? Or who can help me with this?
[09:50:31] <hesco> duch_kazatel: ok, tried foo.val().length() instead and console reports:  Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object GA is not a function
[09:50:48] <duch_kazatel> hesco huh?  you're changing your question.
[09:50:52] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[09:51:17] <pancakes9> http://jsfiddle.net/LBS2a/7/ -- can someone help me figure out why the #total isn't updating when I change the #quant field?
[09:51:56] <hesco> duch_kazatel: I am trying to write a conditional which evaluates to true if the value of that form field is not undefined
[09:51:58] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 because you're not binding to the change event.

[09:52:10] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: could you explain? i'm a newb :(
[09:52:28] <pcfreak30> duch_kazatel: thats how relative paths normally work. jq is treating it differently which it shouldnt be
[09:52:51] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 you're changing the value on load.  you're not bound to any event - the page doesn't magically bind things for you.
[09:52:57] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[09:52:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/on/

[09:54:56] <halt_rrr> yes
[09:55:06] <arschmitz> its hosted by media temple
[09:55:17] <arschmitz> and its whatever media temple uses for all their servers and hosting
[09:55:37] <halt_rrr> So I'd better ask media temple guys?
[09:56:19] <arschmitz> halt_rrr: well i dont think you will get an actual list from anyone but if you think you are incorrectly blacklisted you can file an issue on jquery.com repo
[09:56:26] <arschmitz> and we will look into it
[09:56:35] <arschmitz> and contact media temple
[09:58:38] <halt_rrr> Well, you see I am not sure of whether my ISP incorrectly blacklisted. But it seems like... Because I _can_ ping jquery.com / jquery.org. But the web page itself is not opening

[10:07:43] <duch_kazatel> hah or decx can do it.
[10:07:58] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: wow thanks!!
[10:08:00] <duch_kazatel> mine was starting with the bacsics: http://jsfiddle.net/LBS2a/10/
[10:08:01] <pancakes9> jquery so confusing :(
[10:08:05] <duch_kazatel> thank decx, not me.
[10:08:57] <pancakes9> decx: thanks!
[10:09:07] <pancakes9> i shall be back with more questions later..
[10:09:08] <decx> should have seen me this morning duch, i came into the channel. 5 people started asking stuff simultanously and i helped them all. it was glorious
[10:09:25] <duch_kazatel> decx well done.
[10:09:29] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:09:40] <duch_kazatel> i'm going to be a little out of it the next few days.
[10:10:20] <Kamuela> to each his own i guess
[10:10:30] <Kamuela> javascript on the whole was way more confusing than jquery is
[10:10:35] <duch_kazatel> not imo.
[10:10:58] <decx> i played around some more with svg filters http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zzYqN/
[10:10:59] <Kamuela> jquery = selectors and binding events to them
[10:11:11] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela what about querySelectorAll?
[10:11:12] <Kamuela> it's the DOM functionality that should have been part of javascript
[10:11:18] <Kamuela> that's just a selector
[10:12:17] <duch_kazatel> sure, but it's something that was added to the DOM spec to make life a bit easier.
[10:15:59] <halt_rrr> arschmitz: I just created issue on git hub.
[10:31:55] <hesco> I have a working event like: $('select[name="foo"]').on( 'change', function() { $('#this_div').show(); });  but after server-side data validation #this_div collapses back to its default display: 'none' while reloading the incomplete or invalid data, albeit hidden from view.  So I wrote a condition to check for $('select[name="foo"]').val().length, and if true to reset to the default, then restore the value with $('select[name="foo"]').va
[10:31:58] <hesco> l( $('select[name="foo"]').val() ); hoping that would trigger the the previous .show(), but it does not do so.  Should that be able to work?
[10:34:50] <shoky> huh you're setting the select's value to the same select's value..?
[10:35:11] <shoky> doing .val() doesn't trigger a change event, if that's what you were looking for
[10:38:18] <hesco> shoky: yes, that was what I was looking for.  thanks
[10:57:35] <phelix> I have such a hard time sometimes getting javascript to fire up on a page. Why does sometimes it needs. jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { and other times it needs $('document').ready(function(){ ?
[10:57:58] <shoky> phelix:  it never needs $('document').ready
[10:58:35] <phelix> jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { console.log("XX"); });
[10:58:44] <phelix> wouldn't you thnk this would display XX inside my console log?
[10:59:00] <shoky> phelix: yes, i was referring to the quotes around 'document'
[10:59:19] <phelix> any ideas why this would not display XX to my console log? Not even getting an error
[10:59:35] <phelix> ahh  nvm i got it
[10:59:36] <shoky> i'd need to see the whole page
[10:59:39] <shoky> kk
[11:27:01] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/aKb2f/ Any ideas why jquery is not adding and removing this class on mouse over or hover?
[11:28:14] <duch_kazatel> because you don't have jquery enabled in that fiddle?
[11:28:41] <phelix> hah
[11:29:09] <phelix> weird.. it works on the fiddle and not my page.. wtf
[11:29:56] <phelix> on my page the top part    $('.evolve-img-on').addClass('evolve-off'); works but the hover part of this script doesn't seem to be removing or adding that class
[11:31:19] <phelix> any idea what might cause it to not work on my page but work fine on the fiddle?
[11:31:53] <duch_kazatel> $('.evolve-img-on').hover() ? what version of jquery?  any console errors?  etc.
[11:32:01] <phelix> no console errors
[11:32:04] <phelix> yah the .hover
[11:32:10] <phelix> its using 1.8
[11:32:46] <phelix>    $('.evolve-img-on').addClass('evolve-off'); this is working as it adds that class to all the image elements
[11:32:55] <phelix> but the hover isn't removing it on mouseover
[11:33:19] <duch_kazatel> i'd start console logging to make sure the event bindings are fixing.
[11:36:39] <Mindstorm8191> alright, i think I need some assistance.  I thought this would work but nothing is happening.  I dropped the new portions of my code here: http://pastebin.com/0E6uuSZ2
[11:37:47] <phelix> how would I get a console.log inside $('.evolve-img-on').hover( to see if the event binding is making it into there?
[11:38:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aKb2f/2/
[11:38:35] <duch_kazatel> .hover() runs two event bindings for you - you'll need to test both.
[11:40:03] <phelix> yah, I don't get anything on mouseover in console log
[11:40:15] <duch_kazatel> okay, same with the mouseout?
[11:40:21] <phelix> yah nothing
[11:41:00] <duch_kazatel> that means your binding is broken.  console.log($('theselector')) right before, where theselector is the same as the tag you're running .hover() on.
[11:41:04] <duch_kazatel> see what that returns.
[11:41:12] <duch_kazatel> basically, make sure your classes are all kosher.
[11:42:34] <phelix> I added console.log($('.evolve-img-on')) right before the hoover. I am getting all sorts of stuff. Big ole Object
[11:42:49] <duch_kazatel> mmk - and the thing you want is in there?
[11:43:23] <phelix> http://pastebin.com/kDhu2LxU
[11:43:44] <phelix> Well I am just using it on the img class .evolve-img-on
[11:44:07] <hesco> How might I rewrite this conditional 'if( facility_type.val().length ){', to avoid this error:  "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" ?
[11:44:10] <duch_kazatel> try recreating the fiddle with your rendered code maybe?
[11:44:11] <phelix> its showing img.evolve-img-on instead of just .evolve-img.on not sure if that will make a difference
[11:44:32] <duch_kazatel> hesco check if facility_type.val() is defined.
[11:44:44] <duch_kazatel> phelix wait...
[11:44:47] <phelix> ugh. that could be ugly
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> img.evolve-img-on vs .evolve-img.on ?
[11:45:08] <duch_kazatel> evolve-img-on is different from .evolve-img.on
[11:45:17] <duch_kazatel> err, .evolve-img-on vs .evolve-img.on
[11:45:31] <phelix> yeah i didn't mean to add the *.on
[11:45:36] <phelix> it should have been *-on
[11:48:07] <phelix> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/aKb2f/4/
[11:48:34] <duch_kazatel> and this should work 100%?
[11:48:49] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using locally?
[11:48:55] <phelix> Well I added more of my site stuff to the fiddle. This appears to be not working like my site
[11:48:56] <phelix> 1.8
[11:49:23] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/aKb2f/5/
[11:51:21] <phelix> now it does not appear to be working on the fiddle as its not with my site
[11:51:56] <decx> your approach is bad
[11:52:22] <duch_kazatel> something seems off about this, but why aren't you using the hover psuedoclass?
[11:52:22] <decx> all these single images should be in one big spritesheet, and then you just move background position on hover
[11:53:02] <phelix> I am not sure
[11:53:10] <phelix> not sure what the hover psuedoclass is
[11:53:13] <phelix> you mean with css?
[11:53:16] <duch_kazatel> yes
[11:53:32] <decx> for something like this you don't need any js
[11:54:06] <phelix> Because I don't want the off image to be shown and I want to use a transition so on mouseover the on image fades out and the off image fades in
[11:54:15] <phelix> can't seem to do 2 hover items at once with css
[11:54:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix all you're doing is adding/removing a class.
[11:54:45] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/aKb2f/6/ I have it working ok here
[11:54:47] <duch_kazatel> you can do exactly this same behavior using :hover in your css instead.
[11:54:56] <phelix> I know but I need to add more to it the script will not be done.
[11:55:06] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[11:55:23] <duch_kazatel> because your other issue is that you're binding to the <img> and not the <a>
[11:55:43] <phelix> Well. I don't want that red underneath to show up so it will need to be gone on page load. Then one image opacity will need to be 0 and the other 1 and then on mouseover it will swap
[11:55:50] <phelix> unless this can all be done with css you think
[11:55:55] <duch_kazatel> the "gone on pageload" should be done via css.
[11:56:15] <phelix> ahh ok well that makes sense then. Its because I am targeting the img tag instead of the a tag
[11:56:48] <duch_kazatel> nothing you're doing requires any javascript btw.
[11:56:50] <duch_kazatel> it's all css.
[12:23:35] <daivyk> hi, i have <a> att, how can I select all the elements that have href="string1#string2" but string1 is optional
[12:23:49] <duch_kazatel> daivyk add a class in your backend instead and select that.
[12:23:55] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors are slow.
[12:24:09] <BillCriswell> Word.
[12:26:31] <daivyk> ok
[12:26:38] <daivyk> thanks
[12:27:13] <BillCriswell> decx: However... you could use maybe $('a[href*=#]') if you needed to.
[12:32:58] <decx> like i'm gonna use a selector that inefficient, even wrong tab complete doesn't excuse that
[12:33:05] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[12:34:16] <YamakasY> guys I need to override a formfields value... how am I going to do that ?
[12:34:25] <duch_kazatel> .val()
[12:34:25] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: for form fields
[12:34:56] <duch_kazatel> $('#theField').val('butts');
[12:39:54] <apajo> why cant i add resizable effect to mt table tr elements or does anyone know a workaround for it?
[12:50:39] <decx> it can't work, resizable puts divs into the element and a tr can't have direct div children
[12:57:58] <apajo> decx: i've noticed that it creates a new div for the handle, bot why wont css do the trick, works on every other element but not tr :S
[12:58:41] <DPowers> Hello everyone, it's been a while since I've used MIRC and i'm definately a JQuery Newbie. I am looking for some help with the sortable function.. in particular I've got 3 sortable lists and I can drag and drop between the 3. The problem is I want to save the order and current list to a db.. I'm basically looking for the calls and the variables that get posted (i'm good once I get can get the
[12:58:41] <DPowers> variables to php)
[12:59:09] <HD|Laptop> Hi all. I'm trying to code a "input helper" for touchscreens
[12:59:36] <HD|Laptop> i bind to focusin() and focusout() of input type="text" a function that shows and hides my virtual keyboard div, that works fine
[12:59:56] <HD|Laptop> but as soon as I click a button on the virtual keyboard, a focusout gets fired on the input element
[12:59:58] <DPowers> the lists have ids of sortable1, sortable2, sortable3 and all have a class of connectedSortable
[13:00:09] <DPowers> anyone feel like trying to help with this?
[13:00:11] <HD|Laptop> naturally this makes the virtual keyboard vanish
[13:00:22] <HD|Laptop> can I somehow find out the "new focused element"?
[13:02:58] <BillCriswell> HD|Laptop: There's document.activeElement that might be useful.
[13:16:31] <duch_lunch> i love me some teriyaki
[13:17:14] <BillCriswell> duch_lunch: I hear that.
[13:20:47] <xorl> in a .change() can you have multiple props set ?
[13:22:27] <BillCriswell> xorl: Not sure I'm following you.
[13:24:16] <Bardamu> Hi
[13:25:12] <Bardamu> Is it better to show and hide a div or to create, append and delete it ?  What is the best for the speed ?
[13:25:29] <duch_lunch> show/hide
[13:25:32] <duch_lunch> depending
[13:25:35] <decx> depends on the situation
[13:25:56] <Bardamu> in what situation what is the best ?
[13:26:06] <xorl> BillCriswell so I have a $('#account').change(function(){ $('#region').prop('selectedIndex',0); $('#type').prop('selectedIndex',0); });
[13:26:28] <BillCriswell> xorl: Ok.
[13:26:31] <xorl> only the region gets changed, not the second type
[13:26:39] <xorl> , type*
[13:26:52] <xorl> and it's named properly and all
[13:27:05] <Bardamu> Can someone gives me an example for one situation when one is the best and one situation when the other is the best ?
[13:27:06] <BillCriswell> xorl: There's no reason #type shouldn't change as well.
[13:27:13] <__joshua__> Bardamu:  haven't benched mark, but hide/show should be faster.
[13:27:19] <xorl> BillCriswell yeah, if I change it to just type, type changes
[13:27:20] <BillCriswell> Bardamu: How about you describe your situation and we let ou know lol.
[13:27:37] <BillCriswell> Well... we recommend a way.
[13:28:14] <__joshua__> Definately hide/show there is supposed to be one element, and you toggle it back and forth.  it you have tonnes of complicated rules for showing/hiding a bunch of things, often its just easier to remove all and do a full redraw from a template
[13:28:16] <BillCriswell> xorl: Do console.log($('#type').length); and make sure it returns something.
[13:28:23] <xorl> will do
[13:28:58] <duch_lunch> Bardamu it's readlly circumstantial.  what is your particular case?
[13:29:02] <decx> Bardamu if you just want to change the text of a button depending on its state (show/hide ...) then just change its text, if you have something more complicated use show hide
[13:29:43] <Bardamu> it's just to make appear a form when you click on a button
[13:29:55] <duch_lunch> show/hide that
[13:38:00] <xorl> BillCriswell i got it to work
[13:38:24] <xorl> It was working just my ajax calls were putting the field entries in without a "change this select box" and I wasn't noticing the text change
[13:40:55] <BillCriswell> xorl: Niiice.
[13:41:02] <xorl> yeahhh
[13:41:12] <xorl> so it works, i'm just a gimp haha
[13:58:09] <guy> Does jQuery have any .repeat(X, function () {}) helper method?
[13:58:33] <guy> I know it is straightforward for/while, but sometimes repeat() method would be useful due to JavaScript scoping.
[13:59:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:59:36] <duch_kazatel> what are you repeating?
[13:59:48] <guy> well, say I know I need to run a function 10 times.
[14:00:28] <duch_kazatel> and you want to scope things to a function, instead of the parent scope?
[14:01:12] <guy> My question is very simple. Does jQuery expose any sort of iterator that allows to repeatedly call a callback X number of times.
[14:01:23] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of.
[14:01:29] <guy> Thank you
[14:01:51] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't mean there isn't one, but im not terribly sure what your actual problem is.
[14:03:15] <guy> I was looking for equivalent of http://lodash.com/docs#times
[14:04:51] <BillCriswell> guy: Damn, looks like you might need to break out the ol' for loop.
[14:05:36] <dcherman> Or use lodash.
[14:05:36] <guy> oh snap. console.group supports nesting. That's a nice find!
[14:06:04] <duch_kazatel> i mean, each() gives you a way to enumerate over stuff and could let you create a scope for it, or you could use a for loop and scope in that like BillCriswell suggestion, but i'm not aware of jquery providing anything like that.
[14:06:31] <BillCriswell> Wooorrrdddd
[14:06:37] <axilla> 6/join #css3
[14:06:58] <BillCriswell> I've only been going to #css... That's 2 levels of css I am missing.
[14:07:03] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:07:50] <BillCriswell> Out of here. Later dduddeeee
[14:07:51] <BillCriswell> s
[14:12:54] <guy> haven't tried, but $.each(new Array(5), function () {});
[14:12:56] <guy> might work
[14:13:21] <guy> Yeah it does
[14:13:26] <duch_kazatel> guy it's kind of a strange question.  could you explain why?
[14:13:40] <duch_kazatel> why is that better than a for loop?
[14:13:45] <duch_kazatel> or a do while, etc.
[14:13:50] <guy> No, because that would lead to a discussion, and I really try to avoid those. : )
[14:13:59] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[14:14:12] <YamakasY> damn this is odd
[14:14:29] <duch_kazatel> that's kind of silly.
[14:14:43] <duch_kazatel> perhaps you know something we don't, or we can point you in a better direction.
[14:14:50] <YamakasY> I do a submit and get a response, I set a span over my form and add another imput but also need to use another post... how can I arrange this ?
[14:15:15] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY you want to post a second time?
[14:15:57] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: actually yes but than another $ajax
[14:16:07] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: but I'm using the same form
[14:16:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?  you want to post and then ajax?  why not just ajax the second time?
[14:19:52] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: yes ajax second time too
[14:20:03] <YamakasY> but a different $ajax one...
[14:20:21] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: I get a callback form the first one
[14:21:40] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: should I use some sort of if statement ?
[14:34:57] <zylophone> other than browser storage, can jquery aid in writing data to a json / xml file or does that have to be done via a server script?
[14:35:17] <duch_kazatel> that has to be done via a server script.
[14:35:52] <zylophone> yeah - figured so, more coding to do!
[14:46:08] <YamakasY> what can be wrong when I get an error message very short and it goes back to index ?
[14:46:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:47:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ YamakasY
[14:47:00] <b-ot> YamakasY: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:47:01] <YamakasY> yeah indeed
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> your explanation doesn't make much sense.
[14:47:16] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: the code is exaclty the same as the working one
[14:47:50] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: I get the alter for a matter of a 100's of a second
[14:48:14] <duch_kazatel> i still have no idea what you're talking about.  could you please share some code using one of the services previously listed?
[14:49:45] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.ca/2700353
[14:50:07] <duch_kazatel> copied to jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5B7KW/
[14:51:11] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: ok and now ?
[14:51:30] <duch_kazatel> btw you should be using done and fail instead of success and error.
[14:51:38] <duch_kazatel> assuming you're using a reasonably current version of jquery.
[14:51:50] <YamakasY> oh is that so ?
[14:52:02] <YamakasY> oh I thought still success and error
[14:52:11] <YamakasY> yap always latests
[14:52:14] <YamakasY> *latest
[14:52:47] <duch_kazatel> you should be using done, fail, always, and then, instead of the old callbacks.
[14:53:30] <duch_kazatel> either way, the code in that fiddle shouldn't cause any issues.  pretty plain stuff.  are you stopping the post event in your handler?
[14:54:33] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: in which way stop ? My other $ajax doesn't have this, so I wonder why this happens
[14:55:30] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY could you share a little more of your code?  the supplied example is insufficient to help you.
[14:56:15] <hesco> I'm still frustrated by my jquery rules to handle server-side data validation on our project.  The bug I am working on at the moment relates to the failure of the page with the data validation errors to run the ajax calls necessary to repopulate the cascading selectors.  My test data supports Georgia -> Ga DoC -> prisons in Ga DoC.  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ousb4LM1qq    -- The ajax-driven cascading selectors work on first loadin
[14:56:18] <hesco> g the page, but I need the .show() rules to be applied as well when the invalid data is re-loaded with server-side validation fails.
[14:57:06] <hesco> I can create another .change() event and find the data again, but I would prefer to make this a bit easier on my users.
[14:57:49] <hesco> Any thoughts on how to make my rule at line 56 work?
[14:58:11] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: there is just one other if() in front of it, nothing more... and the success and error work there OK
[14:58:20] <YamakasY> it seems it just "runs" over it
[14:58:30] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY the whole handler would be nice to see.
[14:58:40] <duch_kazatel> hesco you mean on pageload?
[14:59:42] <hesco> yes, on page load, if my .has_error class is found, I need it to use the previously submitted data to again .show() the display: none divs with the cascading selectors.
[14:59:53] <hesco> duch_kazatel: ^^^
[15:00:17] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: cannot do that, kinda big
[15:00:33] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY the code provided is insufficient for me to help you.
[15:01:05] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: what did you mean about "stopping" that post ?
[15:01:50] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY i don't know what your code is trying to do - are you trying to submit a form via ajax instead of a normal submit?
[15:02:31] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: yes, and the first works OK, but this one is "running over" the succes and error and goes back to /index.php
[15:03:56] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY are you running preventDefault() anywherE?
[15:05:14] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: in the beginning of my submit indeed
[15:06:37] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY then I need to see more of your code, because what you gave me doesn't tell me enough.
[15:10:15] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  was that you who added the comments to my code (   // <-----  )  at: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ousb4LM1qq  ??  and if so, what is it you were trying to point out to me on those two lines?
[15:10:38] <duch_kazatel> hesco i didn't add anything - i don't use togetherjs
[15:10:56] <duch_kazatel> btw body tags are invalid in jsfiddle.
[15:10:57] <guy> Does jQuery plugin provide version badges for GitHub? http://plugins.jquery.com/wholly/
[15:11:08] <hesco> also, the jshint tool there has been broken all day
[15:11:28] <hesco> I'm not even sure what togetherjs is.
[15:11:30] <duch_kazatel> hesco also, you have some majorly broken code.
[15:11:45] <duch_kazatel> var console_log = 'facility: ' + facility_state_val; - don't do that
[15:12:00] <duch_kazatel> and togetherjs is what the whole collaboration thing does.
[15:12:07] <hesco> how so?  I see that it is not behaving as I wish it to, but am curious to hear what issues you see with it
[15:12:28] <hesco> for some reason I do not see the share link at jsfiddle anymore
[15:12:57] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: but shouldn't it just stop on success or error ?
[15:13:08] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY dunno, i need to see more code.
[15:13:35] <duch_kazatel> hesco you have to "save" it first: http://jsfiddle.net/KF425/
[15:13:59] <hesco> ah, thanks
[15:14:02] <duch_kazatel> hesco also, you're declaring vars with the var keyword in child scopes.  that's very strange.
[15:14:03] <YamakasY> doublerebel: just place that one an an if else if statement :) nothing more actually
[15:14:07] <duch_kazatel> and alert() is bad.
[15:14:28] <hesco> alert() exists only as a debugging tool here
[15:14:35] <duch_kazatel> hesco use console.log() instead.
[15:14:37] <hesco> I will lose those when I deploy
[15:14:37] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: yes, but good for testing :)
[15:14:47] <duch_kazatel> terrible for testing.
[15:14:49] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: it doesn't log as it goes back to the index
[15:14:51] <duch_kazatel> use a debugger instead.
[15:14:58] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY i cannot help you.
[15:14:59] <YamakasY> so it refreshes the page
[15:16:56] <zylophone> when debugging, is it possible to step through javascript being executed with firebug?
[15:18:02] <duch_kazatel> zylophone yes.
[15:18:17] <duch_kazatel> script tab - the arrow icons on the top right of the script source.
[15:19:24] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: almost found it
[15:19:48] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:32:40] <zylophone> when cloning during a draggable, how do i refer to the clone? $(this) refers to the original item
[15:55:55] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: fixed!
[16:31:57] <shoky> zylophone: ui.helper
[16:44:03] <xniz> jquery seems so useful, yet I just don't know where to begin :P
[16:47:09] <tandroid> xniz: http://www.codecademy.com has a good tutorial to get you started
[16:48:32] <zylophone> so, after i've finished dragging, on the stop event, i want to modify the cloned draggable, but when i do, it seems i modify the original item as well as teh cloned item. is this possible to modify one and not the source?
[16:49:07] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[16:50:47] <zylophone> ok, i'll try
[16:57:38] <pnj> hi folks
[16:59:06] <pnj> I have two <p> elements. one has an ID the other doesn't have a class or ID
[16:59:37] <pnj> $('p').text("hello") is used to change the text in one
[17:00:19] <pnj> $('#start").text(" hi there");
[17:00:33] <pnj> problem is I get "hello" in both <p> tags
[17:00:43] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ pnj
[17:00:43] <b-ot> pnj: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:00:52] <zylophone> heh, duckduckgo - type "foo mirror"
[17:02:25] <pnj> eh. well wtf. now it works...
[17:02:37] <pnj> thanks for nothing, i guess. :)
[17:02:42] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery not
[17:02:43] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: :not() Selector | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[17:02:51] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery filter
[17:02:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .filter() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[17:11:53] <zylophone> heh - it would appear my example doesn't even drag/drop :( http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/2/
[17:12:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/3/
[17:12:45] <duch_kazatel> that does drag.
[17:13:34] <zylophone> yeah, but upon drop, it vanishes
[17:14:44] <xniz> ok, i got some basic jquery stuff in my file, but I am interested in sequential animations.
[17:14:52] <shoky> zylophone: the clone is removed by default after the stop event
[17:14:54] <duch_kazatel> xniz callbacks.
[17:14:59] <zylophone> oh
[17:15:06] <shoky> zylophone: you have to clone it in the stop event if you want it to stick around
[17:15:18] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  I understand that part, but im trying to figure out how to loop through the 5 thumbnails i have
[17:15:39] <duch_kazatel> fiddle up an example, xniz?
[17:15:47] <xniz> one moment
[17:15:57] <xniz> http://portal.xniz-solutions.com/~rewind/ <----
[17:16:19] <xniz> i dont want each thumbnail to fade in at the same time. i need to find a way to sequence each object.
[17:16:20] <zylophone> thanks shoky
[17:16:37] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/4/
[17:16:49] <zylophone> oh, i didn't clone it as such, just appended the helper to the droppable
[17:16:56] <duch_kazatel> xniz that is slooooowwwww
[17:17:04] <xniz> yes sorry, my host is having problems.
[17:17:14] <xniz> its actually on a dedicated gigabit line
[17:17:20] <shoky> zylophone i'd just use clone  http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/5/
[17:17:26] <xniz> i ordered the dedicated server last week and have had problems since day 1 ugh
[17:17:51] <xniz> but, do you understand what I am asking? I'd like to animate each thumbnail/fadein in sequence from left to right
[17:18:10] <duch_kazatel> xniz uh, okay. either way, you'll want to find the first li, animate that, then do a callback in there to hit the next one.
[17:18:19] <shoky> zylophone woops i meant .appendTo(this)
[17:18:26] <zylophone> shoky: oh, that's nice and simple, thanks
[17:18:37] <zylophone> caught it :)
[17:18:42] <xniz> yes. that is what I am trying to figure out how to do. so I should research the callback functions first?
[17:19:00] <duch_kazatel> research the callback and look at .each()
[17:19:03] <xniz> sorry I am a noob with jquery, I have had experience with my own animation in JS without any external library
[17:19:06] <duch_kazatel> or a for loop
[17:19:07] <xniz> ok
[17:19:12] <xniz> for loop sounds good
[17:19:36] <duch_kazatel> .each() will make things easier, but it comes with its own caveats.  you'll figure it out.
[17:19:41] <xniz> i have found that jquery is very popular, which is why I am wanting to learn
[17:19:56] <xniz> instead of writing my own FPS/animations in plain js
[17:20:26] <duch_kazatel> they each have their own place and time.
[17:20:55] <xniz> ok so.. callbacks and .each
[17:21:19] <duch_kazatel> yep.  animations generally have a done or complete callback.
[17:21:46] <xniz> alright.  thank you so much :D
[17:21:56] <xniz> i am sorry if the questions are relatively noobish.
[17:22:12] <duch_kazatel> also .queue()
[17:22:21] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery queue
[17:22:23] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.queue() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.queue/
[17:22:35] <duch_kazatel> ugh - this one i mean: api.jquery.com/queue/
[17:23:29] <xniz> oh i see. sequential animations with queue
[17:23:43] <duch_kazatel> that'll have pertinent infomation for you.
[17:25:59] <xniz> that seems to be quite simple.  the only problem I may have is animating a direct object... for example, <ul><li> would animate all of the <li> elements within <ul>.. how do I assume a name or a reference to grab it and use only the selected <li>?
[17:26:15] <xniz> how do i assign** sorry
[17:27:03] <xniz> if you look in my HTML code, I use just <ul> and <li> , should i set a class or id for each <li> ?
[17:27:21] <xniz> ie: <li id="thumb1">
[17:28:34] <duch_kazatel> an id might be a good choice.
[17:28:52] <xniz> alright. sounds good. thank you again. I will give it a go
[17:28:54] <duch_kazatel> also check out .each() and learn about the array-like object that gets returned from the jquery constructor.
[17:29:07] <duch_kazatel> .eq() can be used there, too.
[17:29:09] <xniz> alright, i am familiar with arrays
[17:29:15] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go.  enjoy.\
[18:13:13] <jamesd> is there a more effient way to write this line  $("#mydebug span").html($("#mydebug span").html() + "<br />" + out);
[18:15:09] <shoky> jamesd: .append("<br />" + out)
[18:44:35] <hugo_m> hey arschmitz
[18:44:39] <hugo_m> are you there?
[18:47:08] <arschmitz> yes
[18:47:16] <arschmitz> hugo_m: whats up?
[18:47:25] <hugo_m> hey arschmitz
[18:47:40] <hugo_m> that code from the query book i mentioned yesterday
[18:47:45] <hugo_m> i decided to type it in and run
[18:48:47] <arschmitz> ok
[18:49:04] <delizin> Hey all. I am struggling trying to resolve an error and was hoping someone could help me. I am using the fullcalendar library and everything works fine, including dragging and dropping events. However when I attempt to call ajax to post updates upon moving an event I get an error in my console that says "TypeError: a is undefined." I am pretty sure it is my fault, but I can't find the problem. This is the code: http://dpaste.com/1790
[18:49:07] <hugo_m> http://pastie.org/9098976
[18:49:14] <hugo_m> if i set a breakpoint on line 29
[18:49:20] <hugo_m> it never stops on the breakpoint
[18:49:25] <delizin> I tried to put it in jsfiddle, but I'm not sure where I can upload the external js files to test with it
[18:49:37] <hugo_m> there must be some corner case which is the reason why reiseg put it there
[18:50:00] <hugo_m> but i don't see it, i know you guys explained it yesterday, but i don't think that it is the reason
[18:50:01] <arschmitz> hugo_m: its because this is a generic test suite code
[18:50:15] <shoky> delizin bad url
[18:50:16] <arschmitz> hugo_m: but in those tests its never used because pause is called
[18:50:35] <arschmitz> and that checks if its paused and if its not runs
[18:50:38] <juxta_> is it permitted to advertise paid work (jquery related obviously) in here?
[18:51:14] <hugo_m> but aren't you always suppose to call pause in the tests?
[18:51:27] <delizin> shoky: If I change the url to one below, which I know is good and works since it retrieves the json successfully and loads it, it still fails the same way
[18:51:38] <arschmitz> hugo_m: no
[18:52:04] <arschmitz> hugo_m: only if the test contains code that async
[18:52:11] <shoky> delizin: i mean, the url you posted is bad
[18:52:12] <arschmitz> so that it needs to wait
[18:52:15] <hugo_m> ahh
[18:52:26] <hugo_m> so you mean for non-asynchronous code, there is no need for pause
[18:52:30] <arschmitz> these tests all contain setTimeouts
[18:52:39] <hugo_m> and when that code is run, it will use that if
[18:52:45] <delizin> shoky: Hmm I'll repost it, it is working for me. http://dpaste.com/1790423/
[18:52:47] <hugo_m> ok cool
[18:52:54] <shoky> delizin: it was cut off at the end
[18:52:59] <hugo_m> thanks
[18:53:04] <arschmitz> hugo_m: so most unit tests do not require async
[18:53:08] <hugo_m> ok
[18:53:14] <delizin> shoky: Ah, okay. Differences in our clients then
[18:53:24] <arschmitz> but this section is about async tests specficily
[18:53:35] <arschmitz> so of course every test in it is async
[18:53:51] <hugo_m> so when you mix the two, thats when that if !paused resume is called
[18:53:57] <hugo_m> cool
[18:54:03] <arschmitz> hugo_m: to try it out take some of your tests and remove the setTimeout and just put the asserts in the body and remove the pause() call
[18:54:15] <arschmitz> asserts in the body of the test that is
[18:54:26] <hugo_m> ok
[18:54:55] <shoky> delizin: except for all the extra commas the ajax call looks fine. i donno anything about fullcalendar so cant help much if its related to that sry
[18:56:04] <delizin> shoky: Well thanks for taking a look at it none the less
[18:56:51] <delizin> Is there maybe another way I can use jquery to post data to test it out? If I just remove that ajax call it all runs as expected
[18:57:15] <shoky> mm just noticed the moment.js comment
[18:57:48] <hugo_m> arschmitz, yea it stops on it now
[18:57:58] <hugo_m> thank you for your help
[18:58:12] <hugo_m> woohoo
[18:58:13] <arschmitz> hugo_m: no problem
[19:03:47] <shoky> delizin: umm you know that revertFunc is not the 2nd argument to the eventDrop callback?
[19:04:31] <delizin> shoky: I did not. I was attempting to follow the developer's example there.
[19:05:04] <shoky> oh they have an example where they do that?
[19:05:21] <delizin> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs2/event_ui/eventDrop/
[19:05:39] <shoky> "These docs are for an upcoming release"
[19:05:45] <shoky> you're using the upcoming release?
[19:05:51] <delizin> shoky: Ah, version difference. That is the one I'm using though
[19:05:56] <delizin> 2.00b
[19:06:11] <shoky> oks disregard then ;p
[19:07:58] <delizin> I tried changing out my moment.min.js for the moments-with-langs.js and my typeerror changed from a to m
[19:09:25] <delizin> shoky: Okay, just found the source of the problem. It is with the event.start and event.end
[19:09:38] <shoky> yeah those are moment objects
[19:09:48] <Yahkob> Anyone here use bootstrap?
[19:10:03] <Yahkob> Have an issue I'm not sure if its from my bad bootstrap or jQuery :)
[19:10:48] <delizin> shoky: I can do something like alert(event.end) or alert(event.start) just fine, but as soon as it is in the ajax data it breaks. Hmm
[19:12:06] <shoky> delizin: you need to convert it into strings i guess
[19:13:18] <delizin> shoky: That was it. Interesting
[19:13:21] <shoky> delizin .toISOString() for example
[19:13:25] <delizin> shoky: Thanks for helping walk me through that bug
[19:13:29] <shoky> np
[19:17:40] <Yahkob> I'm not sure if anyone can help me kinda new to jQuery trying to do something with bootstrap if someone wants to look at my jsFiddle
[19:17:43] <Yahkob> jsBin*
[19:20:07] <delizin> Whats the issue Yahkob?
[19:20:55] <Yahkob> I'm using panels in bootstrap to log an array via appendTo
[19:21:22] <Yahkob> the first heading should say 0 the text for that should say "one" the next heading: 1 text:"two" and so on
[19:21:48] <Yahkob> for some reason it only displays the first array value. I'm not sure if this is a syntax error with jQuery or bootstrap
[19:21:48] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/kazuxu/2/edit
[19:24:57] <Yahkob> delizin: just fixed some confusing variable names sorry
[19:25:12] <shoky> Yahkob: i think you meant  http://jsbin.com/dorofuki/1/edit
[19:25:19] <zylophone> couple of perhaps simple questions: http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/9/ - what's the difference if i uncomment the connectWith line regarding the sortable? I can't see any difference
[19:25:48] <Yahkob> Ah I see shoky so the child at the end of $index was messing stuff up?
[19:26:07] <delizin> Yahkob: shoky is a champ at this
[19:26:08] <shoky> Yahkob: no you were doing it all wrong in the first 2 lines in the loop
[19:26:22] <Yahkob> ah ok
[19:26:25] <Yahkob> ill check it out
[19:26:26] <shoky> Yahkob: you were calling $('#somediv').html(...) in both lines.. for no reason
[19:27:45] <Yahkob> ah i see
[19:27:51] <Yahkob> didn't need the html()
[19:28:13] <shoky> zylophone: the sortable's connectWith option is just for connecting with another sortable. not with draggables
[19:28:41] <zylophone> shoky: ahh - in the example i'm trying to make sense of - your explanation makes perfect sense - thanks!
[19:29:08] <shoky> zylophone um alto its not a good idea to initialize a sortable inside an event handler like you did
[19:29:23] <shoky> er donno what you're trying to do there actually, in the stop event
[19:29:29] <shoky> $(".droppable").sortable(  wat
[19:29:50] <zylophone> shoky: in the example i'm looking at, the divs that are dragged become sortables
[19:30:09] <shoky> they get attached to a sortable
[19:30:19] <shoky> but that has nothing to do with the stop event
[19:30:22] <zylophone> to allow recursive. i guess would .live be better?
[19:30:37] <shoky> no
[19:30:40] <shoky> .live is never better
[19:30:45] <zylophone> hehe
[19:30:46] <shoky> and no idea what you meant by that
[19:30:49] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/10/
[19:38:41] <xniz> http://portal.xniz-solutions.com/~rewind/ can someone test that for me on something other than firefox and tell me how the animation is
[19:39:19] <abjorn> a little too bouncy for my tastes, but it doesn't lag or anything
[19:39:27] <abjorn> (chrome)
[19:39:35] <zylophone> my second question is regarding a draggable/droppable situation, the draggable has to be cloned to the droppable, but in this case of a draggable into a sortable, no manual cloning takes place. so, how do i target the new clone?
[19:39:37] <xniz> alright thank you
[19:39:49] <xniz> that was my intention, fly in from the right then bounce left and back
[19:39:58] <xniz> also, if u resize the window, the <div> stays centered as well
[19:40:46] <xniz> now i need to find a way to where i click on the thumbnail it expands the image in a seperate window
[19:41:02] <xniz> i know there are some premade libraries out there for jquery but i'd like to code my own
[19:41:16] <xniz> just dont know where to start... maybe using canvas?
[19:41:48] <xniz> im thinking maybe have a canvas for the image to be drawn on, keep it hidden, then make it reappear when the image is clicked.. sounds simple enough i guess
[19:43:20] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/12/ - when dragging stops, the new clone reverts to a clone of the original, and not the helper - how do i effectively work around this?
[19:43:56] <zylophone> uhm, helper reverts to the original copy
[19:49:34] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I am an error "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function". Initialise is already declared but ti doesn't seem to work at al.  http://jsfiddle.net/MPkce/
[19:55:37] <pnj> http://jsfiddle.net/89gyY/1/
[19:56:00] <pnj> I'm not understaning the bind/unbind methods, I guess
[19:56:14] <pnj> I can get unbind to work but i can't rebind..
[19:57:55] <jphase> pnj: firstly, you'd want to .unbind('click').on('click', function(){       but I don't really know why you're trying to unbind to begin with here
[20:02:18] <pnj> jphase: this is just a test
[20:02:26] <BillCriswell> pnj: Are you trying to enable and disable boxes on the fly?
[20:02:42] <pnj> yea BillCriswell. let me explain
[20:03:05] <pnj> i have build a tic tac toe game. when there is a winner. i disable all clicks
[20:03:16] <pnj> and I display a "play again" div
[20:03:39] <pnj> I want to enable the click event for the divs when "play again" is pressed
[20:04:33] <pnj> i'm sure there is a better solution than my attempts
[20:07:59] <Yahkob> shoky: still around?
[20:08:17] <shoky> ya
[20:08:50] <Yahkob> the problem you just helped me with
[20:09:00] <Yahkob> if you prepend the header goes on the bottom and the text on the top
[20:09:13] <Yahkob> but if you appended it was the reverse header on top text on bottom
[20:09:23] <BillCriswell> pnj: You don't need to unbind the events. It could be easier to just change a class on the game's container and just don't do anything if that class is on there.
[20:09:26] <Yahkob> I know this sounds really stupid seeing as it is prepend and it PREpends
[20:09:41] <Yahkob> but why does it flip the two? is there anyway around it?
[20:09:49] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/dorofuki/2/edit
[20:09:51] <Yahkob> I prepended it there
[20:10:17] <arschmitz> Yahkob: append
[20:10:39] <Yahkob> arschmitz:  ?
[20:10:52] <arschmitz> Yahkob: the oppisite of prepend is append
[20:10:54] <Yahkob> append instead of prepend you mean?
[20:10:58] <Yahkob> Yeah I get that much
[20:11:09] <Yahkob> but im not sure how to fix this problem if i need to prepend
[20:12:00] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/cesir/1/edit
[20:12:09] <Yahkob> look at the difference between the two see how they're flipped?
[20:13:03] <arschmitz> Yahkob: im not sure what you mean what are flipped?
[20:14:10] <Yahkob> sec
[20:14:12] <Yahkob> ill show you
[20:14:16] <pnj> BillCriswell: I'm not sure I follow you. addClass('.stopGame") and then if (stopGame) {do something..
[20:14:32] <pnj> that's pseudo code
[20:17:01] <Yahkob> haha i am terrible at mac photo editing arschmitz pictures coming
[20:17:02] <BillCriswell> pnj: Yes.
[20:17:13] <zylophone> arschmitz?
[20:17:22] <arschmitz> zylophone: yes?
[20:17:37] <zylophone> ahh - i thought it was some bizarre german word ;)
[20:17:46] <arschmitz> lol nope
[20:17:52] <arschmitz> schmitz is my last name
[20:17:56] <arschmitz> a r are my initals
[20:17:56] <shoky> Yahkob: is this what you wanted? http://jsbin.com/dorofuki/4/edit
[20:17:59] <Yahkob> arschmitz: like i said terrible at iphoto
[20:18:00] <Yahkob> http://imgur.com/Mwy780J
[20:18:06] <arschmitz> but it is very close to something bad in german
[20:18:08] <zylophone> arschmitz: your parents didn't like you, right ;)
[20:18:21] <Yahkob> yes! thank you shoky
[20:18:39] <shoky> Yahkob: jquery objects don't have a .reverse() method
[20:18:59] <shoky> (so i used .get() to get an array out of them)
[20:19:24] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/13/ - why does the helper revert to what the target is after the dragging?
[20:19:28] <shoky> and also fixed the ordering thing
[20:19:39] <shoky> the order in which you prepend matters
[20:19:55] <shoky> (as it does for append)
[20:20:03] <Yahkob> heh feel dumb
[20:20:41] <arschmitz> zylophone: neither spoke german so they didnt have any idea
[20:20:56] <zylophone> hehe
[20:22:10] <arschmitz> zylophone: there was actually a lot of drama due to this recently
[20:22:49] <arschmitz> someone was commenting on an issue on github and pinged me but auto correct mangled it and it looked like they were swearing at me so a bunch of people yelled at them
[20:23:07] <zylophone> sounds like you're a trouble maker!
[20:23:09] <arschmitz> but it was a complete mistake they had not intended to insult me
[20:23:49] <arschmitz> zylophone: ha ha i had nothing to do with it but thats what happens when you work with people in a lot of different countries miss communication is bound to happen
[20:25:28] <zylophone> uhm, did someone start a collaboration on jf?
[20:28:51] <haleys> Any idea why this jquery code works for chrome but not Safari? It goes all the way inside the IF in Safari, but the google event doesn’t trigger on safari, but does on chrome. See: http://pastie.org/private/xheo0qpni4sg0hcrv41va
[20:30:17] <arschmitz> zylophone: the helper is only for while your dragging its supposed to revert once you drop
[20:30:53] <zylophone> arschmitz: bah - i can't actually find that in the docs, and i'm trying to figure out how to stop it reverting. stoppropagation
[20:30:56] <zylophone> ?
[20:31:07] <arschmitz> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper
[20:31:35] <arschmitz> zylophone: no because its no "reverting" draggable is intedned  to drag the object its called on
[20:32:03] <zylophone> arschmitz: see, if you're dragging into a droppable, you get manual control of cloning - if you don't clone, the draggable vanishes. however, dragging intoa  sortable is a whole new bal game
[20:32:57] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/14/
[20:36:48] <haleys> Anyone?
[20:39:45] <shoky> zylophone i don't think you can easily do this with sortable. sortable isn't too flexible sadly
[20:40:28] <zylophone> shoky: oh, that's sad to hear :(
[20:42:22] <arschmitz> zylophone: http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/16/
[20:42:31] <arschmitz> zylophone: is that what your looking for?
[20:42:33] <zylophone> shoky: i'm guessing i'd have to use the ui.offset to determine what position in the list the helper is in, then replace the newly created element, or, alternatively issue an incrementing id?
[20:43:36] <zylophone> arschmitz: yes!
[20:44:46] <arschmitz> zylophone: cool glad i could help
[20:45:10] <zylophone> arschmitz: thanks, that's exactly what i wanted! who'd thought it'd be a sortable event
[20:45:35] <zylophone> arschmitz: EH UHHH!
[20:45:48] <zylophone> drag FOO / BOO / DOO around :(
[20:46:23] <arschmitz> zylophone: huh?
[20:46:45] <arschmitz> oh i see
[20:46:50] <arschmitz> thats easy enough
[20:48:12] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/19/
[20:48:52] <zylophone> .hasClass('draggable') :)
[20:48:54] <arschmitz> yup
[20:49:34] <arschmitz> in helper in sortable it should just return clone also not clone.clone() but thats minor
[20:49:44] <arschmitz> i mean in helper in draggable
[20:50:18] <zylophone> well i'd clean that back up to how it was before - there's going to be a whole list of different draggables
[20:50:31] <zylophone> or rather, there already is a list of draggables :)
[20:51:06] <arschmitz> zylophone: carefull using replace with like that
[20:51:25] <arschmitz> zylophone: you cant replace something with its own child with out first detaching the child from the dom
[20:51:36] <zylophone> ahh
[20:54:19] <zylophone> guess, i'll be needing an array of items to clone
[20:54:41] <shoky> oh didn't think of the sortable's stop event, ncie
[20:54:46] <shoky> nice
[20:55:23] <arschmitz> zylophone: i lied thats something else this works http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/22/
[20:55:29] <haleys> Sidebar, but does google’s analytics event tracking real time only work in Chrome, and not safari/firefox? I’m using jQuery to submit events, but the only events showing up in real time are ones that come from Chrome, and not from Firefox/Safari.
[20:56:43] <zylophone> arschmitz: that's fine, but it relies on knowing what the item originally was
[20:57:06] <arschmitz> zylophone: in what way?
[20:57:31] <zylophone> imagine, .newish1, .newish2, .newish3 etc
[20:57:57] <zylophone> if that class was appended to the draggable class, is there any way of determining if it was .newish1/2/3?
[20:58:09] <zylophone> without cycling through all possibilities
[20:58:33] <Yahkob> dang shoky that doesn't work in my real problem :(
[20:58:34] <arschmitz> item.className.indexOf( "newish" ) > 1
[20:58:48] <Yahkob> I made a mimic problem because it is too much code to jsbin
[20:58:52] <arschmitz> i mean > 0
[20:59:25] <zylophone> arschmitz: ohh - that's nice
[20:59:26] <Yahkob> the difference between the toy problem and the real problem is there is a js file that randomly generates words and the newest ones are at the end of the array so i have to prepend
[21:10:21] <zylophone> those indexes aren't successive! newish1 gives an index of 0, newish2 gives an index of 10!
[21:11:44] <arschmitz> zylophone: are you trying to figure out if it has any of them or a specific one?
[21:11:59] <zylophone> not saying - i'm working on it - thanks :)
[21:12:10] <arschmitz> indexOf in the way im talking about is just a test to see if it exists
[21:12:19] <arschmitz> anything > 1 means it exists
[21:12:20] <zylophone> don't want you to spoil it for me! yeah, need to substring it out
[21:12:32] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I am an error "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function". Initialise is already declared but ti doesn't seem to work at al.  http://jsfiddle.net/MPkce/
[21:13:22] <arschmitz> zylophone: ok good luck ill probably be around anouther half hour to an hour if you get stuck
[21:13:31] <zylophone> arschmitz: thanks!
[21:15:15] <__joshua__> rahuldroy: you haven't included the google maps api
[21:15:52] <rahuldroy> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=xxxxxxxx&amp;sensor=true"></script>    </head>
[21:16:20] <rahuldroy> __joshua__ on the head section (I have hidden the key
[21:16:51] <__joshua__> you haven't put in the fiddle
[21:17:35] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: oops sorry, the the map function is just before the body tag
[21:17:55] <rahuldroy> __joshua__ I can give you the link of the development site if you want
[21:17:58] <__joshua__> can you link?
[21:18:12] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: http://goyabby.jumta.com.au/classifieds
[21:18:59] <__joshua__> its getElementById, not getElementByID
[21:25:49] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: YAY!!!, THANKS!!!! I spent close to 3 hours trying to figure out where I was going wrong
[21:26:23] <pragma-> it takes you 3 hours to read a simple error message?
[21:26:58] <rahuldroy> I thought iit was a function declaration error....
[21:27:28] <__joshua__> chrome reports: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'getElementByID'
[21:28:16] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: How did you find that??
[21:28:42] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: The error I kept getting was "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[21:30:29] <__joshua__> what browser?
[21:30:45] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: Chrome 34
[21:33:06] <__joshua__> oh, im on an old version
[21:34:49] <rahuldroy> __joshua__: hmmm, there must be a way to find out the errors
[21:53:06] <xniz> anyone know of a jquery library i can use for image popout/preview after clicking on a thumbnail
[21:53:22] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/27/ - what's wrong with the function findIndex? an object is being passed in, but className throws up a type error - e.className is undefined?
[21:53:52] <zylophone> if e is passed in directly, and e.target used in the function it works without a hitch
[21:59:18] <jphase> xniz: there's a ton of lightboxes out there. try colorbox or something similar
[21:59:34] <zylophone> i hate lightboxes :)
[21:59:43] <xniz> ok. all i want is to click on the thumbnail, bring it up with an X in the top right corner
[21:59:45] <xniz> nothin fancy
[21:59:53] <zylophone> just open the image in the browser please
[22:00:17] <zylophone> that way i can middle click all i want and have zillions of tabs
[22:00:24] <jphase> zylophone: lightboxes aren't going anywhere anytime in the near future buddy, sorry ;)
[22:00:44] <jphase> xniz: colorbox can work, several of them work with a rel attribute to connect a series of thumbs
[22:00:50] <Uhkis> zylophone: well that works on lightboxes too
[22:00:56] <xniz> jphrase thats what im lookin for
[22:00:58] <zylophone> jphase: i blame the hipsters
[22:01:09] <jphase> and their thick thick glasses hehe
[22:01:25] <zylophone> and trousers that are too tight
[22:02:30] <jphase> trousers eh? you from GB?
[22:04:43] <zylophone> aye
[22:05:11] <zylophone> only superman wears pants on the outside
[22:12:31] <shoky> zylophone: http://jsfiddle.net/TkKKM/29/
[22:15:21] <xniz> jphase,  thank you, that worked well
[22:16:58] <jphase> sure thing
[22:17:07] <zylophone> shoky: wow - thanks
[22:19:14] <zylophone> shoky: so, in essence, in the stop, it scans the whole element for the hidden div, detaches it from the dom, and then just replaces the new cloned element with this detached one?
[22:19:21] <shoky> zylophone: np and btw .className didn't work because that's not a jquery property, it's a property on native DOM element objects. so if el is a jquery object you'd need el[0].className or el.prop('className')   but there's no need for you to use it
[22:19:37] <zylophone> ahh
[22:20:11] <zylophone> it's too late for me! been up all night on this, and I think this is it!
[22:20:47] <shoky> zylophone pretty much yeah. i'm not sure if the .detach() is necessary there or not, but it doesn't hurt
[22:21:29] <zylophone> heh, nice!
[22:21:32] <zylophone> very clean as well
[22:22:22] <shoky> yea it's almost always a bad idea to use classes like myclass1 myclass2 myclass3 etc
[22:23:12] <zylophone> yeah, i didn't realise that as the hidden div was inside, you may as well just search through the element for it
[22:23:26] <xniz> jphase, was relatively simple to get to work as well :D
[22:32:23] <xniz> jphase, http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/ <-- if ure interested in seeing it in action :D
[22:33:01] <jphase> xniz: nice, now you just need to load the images that are 404'ing and you'll be all set :D
[22:33:11] <jphase> overlay and all that jazz
[22:33:56] <xniz> which images?
[22:34:03] <xniz> what are 404ing?
[22:34:20] <xniz> its all working fine for me
[22:34:59] <zylophone> thanks everyone - night!
[22:36:26] <jphase> xniz: open up your console. you forgot to load the images directory from the zip
[22:36:37] <xniz> hmm one sec
[22:37:13] <xniz> oh ok
[22:38:39] <fattest> am i allowed to ask a question regarding js and css? i'm not sure whether it's a css problem or jquery problem
[22:40:24] <Uhkis> fattest: who's stopping you? ;)
[22:40:38] <fattest> I just want to follow the rules
[22:41:34] <fattest> This is my site here, http://www.getsummoner.info/profile.php?id=309915&region=oce , when I view the website with mobile, the header doesn't cover the whole width...I think this is a problem with bootstrap.min.js or docs.css ....
[22:42:16] <xniz> jphase, http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/ u may refresh :D
[22:42:17] <Uhkis> password protected
[22:42:28] <xniz> im going to look into the settings for this colorbox stuff. see if I can't customize it a bit
[22:42:39] <fattest> Uhkis: oh sorry, use demo and demo7
[22:43:16] <jphase> xniz: there ya go ;)  you may want to look into their other 4 or so themes too if you don't like this one
[22:43:21] <xniz> jphase,  now the only problem is that, if u move your mouse below the thumbnail, you can still click and open the image... not good
[22:43:43] <xniz> for example, hover over one of the thumbnails, then go down a bit underneath of it
[22:43:50] <xniz> the <a> link is going out of bounds
[22:44:05] <xniz> due to the img file being bigger than the bounds I would like
[22:44:22] <Uhkis> fattest: you mean the picture or the bar itself?
[22:44:39] <jphase> yep, css stuffs though, easy to fix
[22:45:08] <xniz> jphase,  which tag should i use to correct that? sorry if im asking too much
[22:46:50] <jphase> xniz: it's not about which tag, you need to change your height to 317px or so on line 43 of default.css
[22:47:12] <xniz> but that will clip the image ?
[22:47:27] <jphase> hmm, not in my browser it doesn't
[22:47:32] <xniz> ok one moment
[22:47:37] <jphase> it's currently overflowing outside the container for me
[22:47:44] <xniz> ehhh ?
[22:47:49] <xniz> screenshot?
[22:49:12] <fattest> Uhkis: sorry for the delay, but i was trying to screenshot http://uploadnow.org/image/354733-IMAG0084.jpeg
[22:49:25] <jphase> xniz: before - http://snag.gy/uQKit.jpg     after - http://snag.gy/Ha0UG.jpg
[22:50:11] <xniz> oh ic.. thats with the change you recommended?
[22:50:15] <xniz> the after pic, that is?
[22:50:20] <jphase> yeah
[22:50:29] <xniz> ok. thank you. i will try it
[22:51:24] <eseidel> Curious if anyone has context about .trigger() behavior for custom events calling same-named functions on the target.  crbug.com/364664
[22:52:44] <xniz> jphase,  hmmm its still picking up the <a> link in the white space
[22:53:40] <jphase> xniz: you still haven't changed the height of #thumbnails li to 320px or so
[22:54:00] <xniz> no i did. i tested it on my local machine
[22:54:42] <xniz> i even dropped it to 200 just for sh*ts and its still pickin it up in the white space
[22:54:44] <Uhkis> fattest: works fine for me (firefox)
[22:54:58] <fattest> Uhkis: on a mobile phone?
[22:55:36] <xniz> maybe.... i have an idea
[22:56:19] <jphase> xniz: http://snag.gy/TleeM.jpg
[22:56:32] <Uhkis> fattest: yes, worked fine on chrome too
[22:56:47] <Uhkis> fattest: on 720p resolution
[22:56:52] <fattest> Uhkis: do you think its just my phone then?
[22:57:15] <xniz> yes jphase , that is what i changed locally and it still didnt fix
[22:57:23] <Uhkis> fattest: kinda impossible to say, what resolution do you have?
[22:57:31] <xniz> im just going to cut some of the bottom of the .jpg off
[22:57:34] <fattest> Uhkis: its a samsung galaxy s2
[22:57:58] <Uhkis> fattest: mine's s3
[22:58:29] <fattest> Uhkis: if its not too much to ask, can you please screenshot it?
[23:00:55] <Uhkis> fattest: uploading
[23:01:19] <fattest> Uhkis: thank you so much
[23:04:26] <xniz> bleh its a bug with colorbox
[23:05:03] <xniz> oh wait
[23:07:27] <jphase> nah
[23:07:51] <jphase> colorbox just binds to the click or one of the mouse events. this is a css issue
[23:07:54] <xniz> i think its something with the <ul> and <li> css propertiees
[23:07:59] <jphase> yeah
[23:08:00] <xniz> ya
[23:08:09] <jphase> it's the height, perhaps you need overflow: hidden; as well on your browser
[23:08:14] <jphase> on webkit the height is sufficient
[23:09:21] <xniz> yep fixed
[23:09:28] <xniz> overflow: hidden on the <li>'s
[23:09:52] <xniz> one sec reuploading
[23:10:36] <xniz> this is pretty sweet :D. never really used jquery until today
[23:11:23] <xniz> jphase, http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/
[23:11:28] <xniz> everything is good as of now
[23:12:49] <xniz> id like to make it swipable now for mobile devices :P
[23:20:08] <crashworks> Out of flow meaning visually, not of DOM
[23:20:47] <jphase> crashworks: well if you're using :nth-child on it and one gets removed from the dom, then they will reapply automatically because the indices change
[23:21:06] <crashworks> jphase, I will try that.
[23:21:25] <crashworks> What's a good method for making sure the bases are covered for toggling on click?
[23:21:44] <crashworks> IE, clicking outside of the element will untoggle
[23:22:58] <jphase> $(document).on('click', function(){ if($(this).hasClass('yourclass')) $(this).toggleClass('yourClass'); });
[23:23:22] <jphase> well that probably won't work exactly how you want it to but I don't really know what you're trying to do heh
[23:31:51] <sledgeDJ> anyone know a good way to setup a second WHM server to mirror an existing one? or do you know of a good # where I can ask?
[23:38:18] <crashworks> sledgeDJ, WHM sucks
[23:38:26] <sledgeDJ> this is true
[23:38:32] <crashworks> That's about as constructive as I can get on the matter.
[23:38:42] <sledgeDJ> I like IIS but boss man likes WHM
[23:38:53] <sledgeDJ> since he doesnt like doing anything right thats what makes him the boss
[23:38:55] <crashworks> Vi and conf files
[23:40:08] <jphase> whm and iis hurt my soul
[23:40:17] <jphase> </rant>
[23:40:24] <sledgeDJ> jphase what do u recommend? apache?
[23:40:34] <jphase> I run nginx
