[00:02:04] <sadtaco> I looked there. I see no callback with select
[00:02:32] <Cork> check the events section
[00:02:34] <sadtaco> Oh you mean the function supplied for select is a callback
[00:02:43] <Cork> yes it is
[00:02:51] <Cork> the widget calls it when something is selected
[00:03:02] <Cork> so it is by definition a callback
[00:03:10] <sadtaco> Right
[00:03:33] <sadtaco> I thought you meant there was a callback like resolve.
[00:04:59] <Cork> there isn't a "resolve" anything as far as i know
[00:06:16] <sadtaco> On source.
[00:06:22] <sadtaco> There is a callback function you supply an array to.
[00:06:30] <Cork> no that is a function
[00:06:32] <Cork> not a callback
[00:06:38] <Cork> source is a callback
[00:06:50] <Cork> also its called response/request not resolve
[00:07:09] <jak2000> hi all
[00:07:12] <Cork> (though you can call it a and b if you like so the name doesn't really matter)
[00:07:34] <jak2000> any beautifull pluglin for draw a pie chard and take the values from an html table?
[00:08:05] <Cork> jak2000: look through the different graph/plotter plugins
[00:08:08] <Cork> there is plenty of them
[00:08:36] <jak2000> Cork any webpage?
[00:08:42] <Cork> google.com
[00:09:07] <jak2000> ok :) thanks
[00:09:10] <jak2000> beautiful
[00:21:36] <Omar-> good morning
[00:26:29] <midori-rus> hello there. Could you recommend the best way to make cross-browser button for mobile version of site?
[00:26:52] <Cork> cross browser button?
[00:26:59] <kevr> I'm trying to manipulate '-webkit-filter' with animate() in jquery, but it doesn't affect anything
[00:27:00] <Cork> what's wrong with <button>?
[00:27:09] <kevr> how could i change a drop-shadow value of -webkit-filter prop?
[00:27:12] <midori-rus> back button
[00:27:14] <midori-rus> sorry
[00:27:34] <Cork> kevr: you would have to add a plugin that can parse the filter property
[00:27:46] <Cork> especially as you want the prefixed version of filter
[00:27:49] <kevr> I see.
[00:27:52] <kevr> gotcha.
[00:28:58] <Cork> midori-rus: window.history.back() ?
[00:30:37] <kevr> Cork: any idea which? i can't find anything for -webkit-filter
[00:30:39] <kevr> ._.
[00:30:54] <Cork> kevr: you might have to write it you're self
[00:31:31] <kevr> I don't really get what to do exactly, though, how would i parse it
[00:31:38] <kevr> how do i even know what it understands
[00:33:02] <Cork> kevr: something like this https://github.com/alexpeattie/animate-textshadow
[00:33:34] <Cork> you would have to do the same type of parsing for filter (and the different filters)
[00:34:25] <kevr> interesting
[00:34:26] <Cork> kevr: css transition might be easier then using .animate
[00:34:28] <kevr> alright, thanks
[00:34:30] <kevr> oh?
[00:34:40] <Cork> as it has built in support for filter animations
[00:34:53] <Cork> and it gets hardware accelerated
[00:35:07] <Cork> so is normally smoother
[01:00:20] <OverCore> Hi, how I can bind the 'width' change on a div with jquery?
[01:03:28] <Cork> OverCore: you can't bind the "width" change at all
[01:03:36] <Kamuela> $('.selector') returns everything contained by that currently highlighted selector right? meaning <div class="selector anotherthing"><a></a></div>
[01:03:48] <Cork> the closest you can get is binding the resize event on the browser window
[01:04:18] <Cork> Kamuela: yes, class selectors allow more then one class existing on the same element
[01:04:25] <Cork> they are inclusive not exclusive
[01:06:31] <OverCore> The div contains a computed width <div style="width: 2000px"></div>. It's not possible to bind a resize on this single div?
[01:06:54] <Cork> no
[01:07:05] <Cork> OverCore: the code modifying the width would have to tell you
[01:07:25] <Cork> OverCore: really modern browser has mutationobservers
[01:07:40] <Cork> and through that you can bind attribute changes
[01:07:48] <Cork> and from that check if the value changed
[01:07:56] <Cork> but there isn't any event for what your looking for
[01:08:06] <OverCore> Cork: ok thanks!
[01:34:08] <Omar-> how to get length of elements with .data()?
[01:34:22] <Omar-> not data attribute
[01:34:55] <Omar-> $("elm").data("type", "foo").length isn't correct
[01:36:40] <dANO__> Hi, I would like to add parameters in my url when my user clicks a button. I tried the function window.location ='?guide=true' but when I click on the button that reload my page and i just want my user stay in the current_page.

[01:40:34] <surianup> Hi all
[01:40:40] <dANO__> @Omar- thanks :)
[01:40:47] <surianup> Hope you all doing well
[01:41:29] <surianup> I wan to scroll down then page when page loded
[01:43:13] <surianup> this is m link
[01:43:14] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/chy12omt/
[01:43:23] <Omar-> surianup: $(document).ready(function () { $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: $(window).height() }, 1500); });
[01:43:43] <surianup> please see and then please let me know
[01:44:44] <surianup> I have used this omar:
[01:44:48] <surianup> $('html, body').animate({
[01:44:49] <surianup>         scrollTop: $("#msgavildates").offset().top
[01:44:49] <surianup>     }, 2000);
[01:44:49] <surianup>  });
[01:44:58] <surianup> but this is not working
[01:45:03] <surianup> I dont know
[01:45:17] <Omar-> surianup http://jsfiddle.net/xscxt1h7/
[01:46:26] <surianup> ]let me see
[01:46:32] <surianup> let me check
[01:47:13] <Omar-> surianup scroll to target div http://jsfiddle.net/uh4gk0ss/
[01:49:25] <Omar-> surianup if you have images, you will have to wait until they are loaded before scrolling
[01:50:11] <surianup> Omar:
[01:50:17] <surianup> buddy it's not working
[01:50:25] <surianup> fro me
[01:50:29] <surianup> for me
[01:50:31] <Kamuela> I have a sibling and then it's child. I'm trying $(this).siblings('.holdComments').find('.commentInner'); and for some reason I'm getting a weird object that's returning the exact thing I'm in, e.g. commentForm
[01:51:05] <surianup> Omar:
[01:51:07] <Omar-> surianup then you might be having other issues
[01:51:08] <surianup> you there
[01:51:21] <surianup> alert is working there
[01:51:30] <Cork> Kamuela: fiddle it
[01:52:19] <surianup> Omar: can I send you link?
[01:52:24] <surianup> for the page
[01:52:31] <Omar-> post it here
[01:52:31] <surianup> for my site
[01:52:35] <surianup> http://demo.stellans.com/propertyhub/
[01:53:07] <surianup> scrool down the page
[01:53:08] <surianup> Latest Properties
[01:53:18] <surianup> there is a section "Latest Properties"
[01:53:53] <surianup> there is a last property name is "
[01:53:53] <surianup> For Sale
[01:53:53] <surianup> 1200 Anastasia Avenue, Coral Gables "
[01:54:14] <surianup> second row last one
[01:54:28] <surianup> have you reached there?
[01:55:05] <Omar-> yea
[01:55:27] <surianup> please click on it
[01:55:46] <Kamuela> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/awanvevd/ I'm trying to clone the last innercomment and then have the post return a new one without needing all of those raw html things. just changing specific values of a new commentInner div. but i can't get a selector to properly fix on commentInner
[01:55:48] <surianup> now you will redirect to the same page
[01:56:10] <Omar-> surianup i did. it reloads the page
[01:56:11] <surianup> and I need to scroll down for this section too
[01:56:48] <surianup> I need to scroll down for the same section Latest Properties
[01:56:51] <surianup> "Latest Properties"
[01:57:03] <surianup> when page is reloding
[01:57:07] <Cork> Kamuela: postComments doesn't have any siblings
[01:57:23] <Cork> it's parent does though
[01:57:36] <Omar-> surfdue $(window).on("load", function () { /* scoll here */ }); should work for you
[01:57:41] <Kamuela> so what i think of as commentForm is really postcomment
[01:58:48] <Kamuela> Cork: would this then work? var lastComment = commentForm.parent().siblings('.holdComments').find('.commentInner').last();
[01:58:58] <Cork> Kamuela: simpler might be to use $(this).closest('.commentsContainer').find('.holdComments .commentInner').last()
[02:00:14] <surianup> Not working bussy
[02:00:19] <surianup> buddy
[02:00:19] <Omar-> surianup ^^
[02:00:40] <surianup> Whats happen Omar?
[02:00:45] <surianup> Omar:
[02:00:56] <surianup> Not working yaar
[02:01:14] <Omar-> surianup just to test it delay scrolling e.g setTimeout(function () { /* scroll */ }, 10000); wait for 10 secs to see
[02:01:18] <Omar-> it should work
[02:01:45] <Kamuela> Cork: why is it when i console.log that I get an object rather than the HTML? is it an object by default and one of its methods would be to return its html?
[02:02:21] <Omar-> surianup you also have two errors, check console log and fix them
[02:03:30] <Omar-> surianup also, why are you loading jquery-ui plus separate widgets of it? load jquery-ui only
[02:10:12] <Omar-> how to get length of elements with .data()?
[02:10:20] <Omar-> not data attribute
[02:10:31] <Woet> Omar-: so the length of what?
[02:11:13] <Omar-> elements with .data("foo", "bar") for example
[02:11:45] <Omar-> i have several elements with .data("type") of three types
[02:12:10] <Omar-> .data("type", "img") "video" and "link"
[02:12:50] <Lebbe> hmm length of element?
[02:12:53] <Lebbe> what does that mean?
[02:12:58] <Lebbe> you mean how many elements?
[02:13:24] <Omar-> Lebbe length of elements WITH .data("type", "something")
[02:13:36] <Lebbe> what does "length of elements" mean?
[02:13:46] <Omar-> Lebbe .length
[02:14:05] <Lebbe> $('[data=something]').size()
[02:14:11] <Omar-> $(".foo").length == how many elements with class "foo" in DOM
[02:15:07] <Omar-> Lebbe size() does the same as .length
[02:15:12] <Lebbe> yes
[02:15:40] <Omar-> .size() == .length
[02:15:44] <Lebbe> i see in the api that size() is actually deprecated
[02:15:46] <Omar-> both return same value
[02:15:47] <Lebbe> so use .length
[02:15:53] <Lebbe> $('[data=something]').length
[02:16:01] <Omar-> i guess i'll use .filter instead
[02:16:05] <Lebbe> why
[02:16:22] <Lebbe> $('[data=something]').length gives you have many elements have a data attribute with the value "something"
[02:16:26] <Lebbe> isn't  that what you want?
[02:16:31] <Lebbe> s/have/how
[02:18:20] <Omar-> Lebbe http://jsfiddle.net/yn16zpu9/
[02:18:27] <Omar-> I tried all possibilities
[02:18:34] <Omar-> .data() != data-attribute
[02:20:31] <Lebbe> yeah
[02:20:41] <Omar-> even filter doesn't work
[02:20:45] <Omar-> :/
[02:23:44] <Omar-> Lebbe http://jsfiddle.net/mokv2rds/
[02:23:48] <Lebbe> $("li").filter(function(){return $(this).data('type') === 'video'}).length
[02:24:19] <Lebbe> yeah
[02:24:22] <Omar-> oh
[02:24:24] <Omar-> it works
[02:24:31] <sprihodko> Hi. Have one problem with bootstrap modal. I want to submit a form when modal is closed. Doing it like this http://pastie.org/10001656 But this submits each form in each modal on the page. How should I change it to submit only form in modal which is closed right now?
[02:24:34] <Omar-> I forgot to wrap code with onload
[02:24:46] <Lebbe> yes
[02:25:14] <Lebbe> i also forgot it should have been $('data-type=something')
[02:25:30] <Lebbe> but it won't work since .data() doesn't set the data attribute it seems?
[02:26:07] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/yn16zpu9/1/
[02:26:18] <Omar-> Lebbe yup, data-type is different than .data("type")
[02:26:51] <Omar-> Lebbe i'm not using data attribute
[02:26:54] <Lebbe> if you set the attribute with .attr('data-type') you can style the different types in css as well
[02:27:17] <Omar-> i know, I'm using .data()
[02:29:08] <Omar-> Lebbe got it working, thanks mate :)
[02:29:49] <smoke_> hey guys, i have a <button> and i want it when it gets clicked to emit a message to my socket.io, in my clinet side javascript would i need $(document).ready(function() { ? or is it not necesary and i can use $('#id').click()?
[02:30:41] <Cork> Kamuela: yes you work with the dom in javascript not html
[02:31:05] <Cork> Kamuela: html is just the text representation you send over the net it isn't normally used in the browser
[02:44:52] <Kamuela> how do i make a selector refer to this instance and this instance only?
[02:46:35] <Uhkis> use id?
[02:53:43] <Teza19> Hi, I have the following code snippet (http://jsfiddle.net/67vekomd/) that retrieves data from another file. I would like to be able to start/stop this loop manually. Is there a way I can add an event trigger to achieve this?
[02:53:59] <Kamuela> Uhkis: can't do that because there's an infinite number of these elements to listen to
[02:55:21] <Kamuela> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11318123/affect-only-one-instance-of-an-element-to-activate-jquery-behavior wow this seems to work
[02:56:34] <Uhkis> lol did people just copy the first answer
[02:57:04] <mooncup> isn't that how you code?
[02:57:11] <mooncup> my coding process is
[02:57:16] <mooncup> 1) google "stackoverflow x"
[02:57:20] <mooncup> 2) copy first result
[02:57:26] <mooncup> 3) paste into netbeans
[02:57:28] <mooncup> 4) push live
[02:57:37] <Uhkis> mooncup: yes, but you paste to netbeans, not back to SO :D
[02:57:47] <mooncup> oh ol
[02:57:48] <mooncup> missed that
[03:07:56] <Omar-> mooncup SO isn't always right

[03:08:42] <chargen> It show the two console logs there but the animation isn't visible
[03:08:46] <Cork> when it comes to web related answers is is normally the wrong answer then the right one
[03:09:14] <Cork> i normally -site: the so when i look for web answer
[03:09:18] <mooncup> 12:07 < Omar-> mooncup SO isn't always right
[03:09:21] <chargen> Looks like it move the image correctly but I can't see it, the img just dissappears
[03:09:22] <mooncup> WHAT!?
[03:10:00] <Omar-> mooncup yeah, believe it or not ;)
[03:10:27] <Omar-> Cork, maybe you can find your answer in high traffic tags

[03:30:32] <Kamuela> okay Omar-  in desperation i am trying all kinds of things. but when i make it just this i get the same issues
[03:30:51] <Omar-> pls create a fiddle with dummy data
[03:30:55] <Kamuela> meaning when i have multiple of these postComments on a page, they'll post to the right box  but they'll append a new comment to every single one
[03:30:59] <Omar-> and tell us what you want to achieve
[03:39:31] <kostodo> How would I do .on('mouseenter', function() for a datepicker div that doesn't exist on page load. Its dynamically created when the input box is clicked.
[03:40:04] <kostodo> How would I do .on('mouseenter', function() for a datepicker div that doesn't exist on page load. Its dynamically created when the input box is clicked.
[03:40:10] <kostodo> err
[03:40:15] <kostodo> pardon
[03:42:27] <chargen> Can't you add the mouseenter also when the box is clicked?
[03:42:44] <Cork> kostodo: you delegate the event to a static parent
[03:42:54] <kostodo> Ah got it thanks.
[03:44:14] <chargen> Cork: Can you help me with this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/35edba03a450a2b74280
[03:44:33] <chargen> I can't see the animation, the img is just hidden or something
[03:44:48] <Cork> chargen: you would have to make a working fiddle
[03:45:02] <Cork> i can't render html in my head based on a snippet of js >_>
[03:45:20] <chargen> yeah, right.
[03:46:18] <Seedmanc> Anybody knows how to replace jQuery version on a site with the one I have in my userscript in Tampermonkey?
[03:46:46] <Seedmanc> If there's no jQuery on site, userscript uses its own just fine, but if there is, the existing remains.
[03:46:54] <Cork> Seedmanc: you normally don't want to do that
[03:47:08] <Seedmanc> But on-site one is old and my userjs doesn't work
[03:47:16] <Cork> instead check if jquery exist in the page and only load your version if there isn't one
[03:47:32] <Cork> Seedmanc: so write it in a manner that works with both new and old
[03:47:43] <Seedmanc> What's the point of progress then...
[03:47:52] <mooncup> lol
[03:48:05] <mooncup> if you just blindly replace their version with yours you may break their site
[03:48:10] <Seedmanc> With new ajax looks neat and nice with these .done .always and stuff.
[03:48:17] <Cork> Seedmanc: so you mean it is better to break the site then making your script compatible?
[03:48:32] <Cork> cause you can't just randomly replace jquery in a page
[03:48:41] <Seedmanc> Nothing breaks there, I don't even know why they need jQuery on tumblr theme with no interactivity.
[03:48:41] <Cork> cause it is normally not backwards compatible
[03:49:19] <Seedmanc> It's just I'm porting my userjs from Opera native to tampermonkey, in Opera I used external <script> loader function and it replaced stuff just fine, everything worked.
[03:49:30] <Cork> Seedmanc: personally i wouldn't use jquery at all in a user script
[03:49:32] <Seedmanc> In *monkey stuff I thought I'd use @require
[03:49:33] <Cork> way to much over head
[03:49:45] <Cork> and as user script is strongly linked to the browser
[03:49:52] <Cork> you can use newer features like Promise there
[03:49:55] <Seedmanc> Too much overhead is writing 10x more text instead of $.dostuff
[03:50:05] <Cork> you don't need to do that
[03:50:23] <Cork> newer browsers has basically all the features jquery provides
[03:50:35] <Cork> you just need to write small (4-5 line) shims
[03:50:48] <Cork> ?mdn promise
[03:50:54] <b-ot> Cork: Promise - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[03:50:58] <Seedmanc> But the idea of libraries is to learn them and do stuff in a straightforward way instead of messing with unique browser ways.
[03:51:13] <Cork> Seedmanc: it isn't unique browser ways
[03:51:23] <Cork> it is just new objects that old browsers don't have
[03:51:33] <Cork> it is something you need to be careful of with web sites
[03:51:40] <Cork> not browser extensions
[03:54:25] <Seedmanc> I don't see why would I use something in beta and not with widespread support, having to learn its ways when there's already jquery supported everywhere.
[03:54:37] <Cork> ...
[03:54:55] <Cork> just cause it doesn't exist in 5-6 years old browsers doesn't mean it is in beta...
[03:55:25] <Cork> the spec is stable and browser have implemented it
[03:57:31] <Kamuela> christ i really can't figure out how to refer to just this instance in a submit callback
[03:57:48] <Kamuela> event.target seems to result in a plain selector that isn't THIS
[03:57:52] <Kamuela> i basically need an event.this
[03:58:51] <Cork> Kamuela: uh, just use this?
[03:59:10] <Seedmanc> http://caniuse.com/#search=promise can't find it
[03:59:17] <Cork> there isn't one on event that is a direct match for event.this
[03:59:35] <Cork> Seedmanc: yes, cause caniuse is for web cross browser compatibility
[03:59:48] <Cork> not extending a single browser
[04:00:52] <Seedmanc> Anyway there's $.noConflict, I don't see how jQuery replacement can cause troubles.
[04:01:16] <Cork> Seedmanc: $.noConflict won't help you
[04:01:26] <Cork> it will still break jquery plugins
[04:01:48] <Cork> $.noConflict is for running jquery along side other frameworks on the same site
[04:01:57] <Cork> like prototype for example
[04:03:28] <Seedmanc> http://puu.sh/gnlKy/c470ff5f38.png how'd you explain this then?
[04:05:43] <Cork> Seedmanc: uh, that is expected
[04:05:52] <Cork> Seedmanc: but plugins always bind to jQuery
[04:06:11] <Cork> and $.noConflict doesn't help there
[04:07:03] <Seedmanc> I assumed whatever I use via jQuery would use 1.6 version while via $ it would use on-site 1.3.2
[04:08:31] <Kamuela> Cork: if i use $(this) does that select only this particular instance?
[04:08:38] <Kamuela> and does traversal result in this particular instance
[04:08:58] <Cork> Kamuela: this is the dom element the event was fired on
[04:09:26] <Cork> $(this) takes the dom element in this and wrap it in a jquery wrapper so you can use jquery functions on the dom element
[04:09:40] <Kamuela> if you do $(this).parent()
[04:09:47] <Kamuela> is it one particular parent
[04:09:47] <Cork> $(this) isn't a selector
[04:09:54] <Cork> see above
[04:10:14] <Kamuela> it's a pinpointed element?
[04:10:35] <Cork> <Cork> Kamuela: this is the dom element the event was fired on <--
[04:10:58] <Kamuela> so $(this).parent() returns the specific dom element of its parent?
[04:11:02] <kostodo> Is there a way of taking a value of an input div like "March" and running it through a function to convert it to 03?
[04:11:10] <Cork> O_o
[04:11:17] <Cork> ?api parent @ Kamuela
[04:11:17] <b-ot> Kamuela: .parent(): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[04:11:46] <Cork> kostodo: 03??
[04:11:49] <Kamuela> is $(this) not a current set of matched elements? e.g. the ONE element
[04:11:55] <Cork> ah you meant month
[04:12:05] <kostodo> Cork, yeah
[04:12:10] <Cork> Kamuela: common how many times do i have to answer the same question??
[04:12:16] <kostodo> I would need to do the same with 1 -> 01
[04:12:19] <Cork> kostodo: build an array
[04:12:27] <Cork> and then use indexOf
[04:12:46] <Cork> kostodo: also Jan != 1 its is 0
[04:12:58] <kostodo> not for what I need ;)
[04:12:59] <Cork> its is?? >_<'
[04:13:12] <Cork> kostodo: then .indexOf() + 1
[04:14:14] <Kamuela> this is the dom element the event was fired on and $(this) takes the dom element in this and wraps it in a jquery wrapper so you can use jquery functions on the dom element. so when i ask "will $(this).parent() result in that dom's elements parent?" my brain is saying "i think i'm making the right connection here, but i need help"
[04:14:24] <Kamuela> so saying "read what i said again" is not helping as it's an entirely new question
[04:15:09] <Cork> Kamuela: try it and see
[04:15:47] <Kamuela> well when i 'try it and see' it seems like $(this).parent() ends up returning something like $('.parentClass') and now targets ALL instances of that class
[04:16:11] <Kamuela> so what i _think_ i understand is wrong because i'd like to target JUST the individual dom element's parent
[04:16:15] <Cork> sigh...
[04:23:28] <Uhkis> so you didn't try and see
[04:24:05] <AltaiEzioR> Hey, I am new here. I wanted to do GSOC with jquery-foundations can anyone help me out
[04:26:38] <Kamuela> There can be any number of places where comments go on the page. I have a submit listener for all of these forms. When a particular one is triggered, I'm trying to append its returned JSON data to JUST that part of the page. Yet the append happens to all places. So there's that
[04:31:50] <Kamuela> ok fixed. git commit -m "No regrets"
[04:32:34] <Kamuela> AltaiEzioR: what is GSOC?
[04:33:26] <AltaiEzioR> Google Summer of Code
[04:54:30] <anli> What is the operator precendence in the line alert($('#contact-form .question > div:first').length); ?
[04:54:40] <anli> I want every first child in a .question
[04:54:52] <anli> I have a lot of .question with divs in them so it should be greater than 1
[04:55:51] <Cork> anli: :first-child not :first
[04:55:59] <anli> Gives me 0
[04:56:05] <Cork> $('#contact-form .question > div:first') is the same as $('#contact-form .question > div').first()
[04:56:08] <anli> I did not know that jquery understood :first-child
[04:56:11] <Cork> anli: then it isn't the first child
[04:56:33] <anli> So I have only been dreaming that div:first has higher precendence than > ?
[04:56:40] <Cork> if you mean you want the first div inside a .question
[04:56:44] <anli> yeah
[04:56:48] <Cork> then you have a bit of a more complex selector
[04:57:32] <anli> But I cant write a selector with parens, I presume
[04:57:35] <Cork> $('#contact-form .question').map(function() { $(this).children('div').first(); });
[04:57:41] <anli> Its not even a selector
[04:57:52] <Cork> ya, cause you can't do it in css
[04:58:06] <anli> Wow, wonder how many times I actually did it
[04:58:20] <anli> I must have thought I did it all the time
[04:58:39] <Cork> well you can get the first one instance with :first (that still isn't css)
[04:58:50] <Cork> but you can't get the first instance of a child
[04:58:56] <Cork> it is just the first in the result array
[04:59:41] <anli> Wait a second now, :first in jquery and :first-child in css are different
[04:59:48] <Cork> yes
[05:00:04] <anli> And first-child exists in jquery selectors as well, right?
[05:00:07] <Cork> one behaves kinda like you want, but it works on the position of the child without the filter
[05:00:17] <Cork> anli: it exist cause it exist in css
[05:00:26] <Cork> and jquery just extends it
[05:00:39] <anli> alert($('#contact-form .question > div:first-child').length); should give me something else than 0 if there is one question with at least one div in it, right?
[05:00:55] <Cork> no
[05:01:04] <Cork> anli: .question > div:first-child means:
[05:01:16] <Cork> if you have a div that is the first child of it's parent
[05:01:29] <Cork> and has a direct parent that has the class question
[05:01:31] <Cork> the include it
[05:01:38] <Cork> that is how css looks at that selector
[05:02:01] <anli> yes, then I should get something else than 0
[05:02:04] <Cork> the include == then include
[05:02:28] <Cork> <div class="question"><div></div></div> <-- yes
[05:02:34] <Cork> <div class="question"><br><div></div></div> <-- no
[05:03:00] <Cork> cause in the second query div is the second child not the first one
[05:03:02] <anli> Aaah, I have an input tag before the div
[05:03:08] <anli> So I need to select on 2nd child
[05:03:09] <anli> lol
[05:03:46] <callumacrae> How can I check whether an object is a jQuery object without loading jquery?
[05:04:10] <Cork> callumacrae: you can't have a jquery object without loading jquery
[05:04:17] <callumacrae> browserify, yeah you can
[05:04:24] <callumacrae> so I have `object`
[05:04:31] <callumacrae> and usually I would `object instanceof jQuery`
[05:04:42] <callumacrae> but I don't want to load jQuery in my library just so that I can call instanceof
[05:04:54] <Cork> callumacrae: no, cause you have to have the function to create the instance
[05:05:01] <callumacrae> browserify
[05:05:05] <callumacrae> o.o
[05:05:12] <Cork> doens't see how that makes any difference
[05:05:33] <Cork> jquery still has to exist, else you can't create a jquery instance
[05:05:35] <Cork> it isn't possible
[05:05:56] <callumacrae> browserify
[05:06:00] <callumacrae> http://i.imgur.com/QvEncbb.png
[05:06:01] <Cork> it might exist in a different memory compartment or something like that
[05:06:02] <callumacrae> o.o
[05:06:03] <Cork> but it has to exist
[05:06:09] <callumacrae> pls stop
[05:06:13] <callumacrae> http://i.imgur.com/QvEncbb.png
[05:06:27] <callumacrae> window.jQuery doesn't exist
[05:06:38] <Cork> callumacrae: then what you have is most likely just an array or dom collection
[05:06:40] <callumacrae> and I don't want to require jquery, because I don't want it to be compulsary
[05:06:48] <callumacrae> no, it's a jquery object, I literally jsut created it
[05:07:04] <Cork> O_o'
[05:07:12] <Cork> callumacrae: that makes absolutely no sense
[05:07:20] <callumacrae> browserifyyyy
[05:07:25] <Cork> js can't create an object without a constructor
[05:07:32] <callumacrae> browserriiiifffyyyyyy
[05:07:37] <callumacrae> this is almost painful :D
[05:07:38] <Cork> doesn't change the fact
[05:07:58] <Cork> you can't do new undefined and get jQuqery
[05:08:02] <Cork> *Query
[05:08:10] <Cork> it just isn't possible
[05:08:19] <callumacrae> http://i.imgur.com/vKMRWSu.png
[05:08:21] <callumacrae> browserify!
[05:08:34] <Cork> ok, how do you create the object?
[05:08:45] <callumacrae> outside of my library, in jquery
[05:08:51] <callumacrae> in browserify*
[05:09:02] <Cork> so you have the compartment situation i mentioned before
[05:09:17] <callumacrae> jquery is available in a bit of the app, but it isn't available in the library I'm writing because I don't want to rely on it
[05:09:28] <callumacrae> yes, "<callumacrae> window.jQuery doesn't exist"
[05:09:55] <Cork> callumacrae: i didn't ask about if the global object is accessable to you
[05:10:03] <Cork> but you stated that jquery doesn't exist
[05:10:08] <Cork> and that is a totally different thing
[05:10:27] <callumacrae> I've said "in my library" a few times :p
[05:10:59] <Cork> check for obj.jquery
[05:11:09] <Cork> callumacrae: it still exists
[05:11:16] <Cork> you just don't have access to the reference
[05:11:22] <callumacrae> yes, that has a jquery version. awesome, thanks
[05:11:29] <Cork> obj.jquery or obj.aniamte wouldn't exist if you didn't
[05:11:42] <Cork> *it if didn't
[05:11:57] <callumacrae> I thought that was so obvious that I didn't need to say it ;-)
[05:12:36] <Cork> callumacrae: choosing the correct words matter
[05:12:46] <callumacrae> read what I said, I never said jquery doesn't exist
[05:12:54] <callumacrae> I said it isn't available, I said I don't want to load it, I said window.jQuery doesn't exist
[05:12:57] <Cork> and saying something doesn't exist, is something very different from not having access to the reference
[05:13:01] <callumacrae> dude
[05:13:04] <Cork> you said it doesn't exist
[05:13:05] <callumacrae> okay im just going to stop now xD
[05:13:09] <callumacrae> quote me, you can't
[05:13:40] <Cork> sigh fine your king, i don't have the strength to fight with you (and i really don't care)
[05:14:05] <Cork> but for future questions pick your word better
[05:16:52] <callumacrae> haha, you don't need to be strong to copy and paste a single line
[05:16:56] <callumacrae> you do, however, have to be correct
[05:17:44] <Cork> so nice that irc has ignore lists
[05:22:00] <EchoAlpha> Hey there - bit of a weird problem. I have two sortable lists, one is "normal" and the other resides in a sticky-footer that is sometimes "above" the first list. I can drag stuff out of the sticky-footer and into the "normal" list, but not the other way around. Any ideas?
[05:23:01] <Cork> EchoAlpha: might depend on z-index
[05:23:30] <Cork> but ya, when two sortable list overlap it tend to be... lets say not consistent :)
[05:24:05] <EchoAlpha> Cork: I have the "normal" lists z-index set to -900 :b And the sticky-footer to 900
[05:24:13] <EchoAlpha> Isn't working tho :/
[05:24:15] <EchoAlpha> Mh, crap :(
[05:24:25] <Cork> EchoAlpha: careful with negative z-index
[05:24:47] <Cork> that puts it below the body and normally cause all kinda of nasty problems
[05:24:54] <EchoAlpha> Whokai :) Setting it to 0 and trying..
[05:25:10] <EchoAlpha> Negative :(
[05:25:21] <Cork> i would set it to 1
[05:25:34] <Cork> not sure if 0 is ok or not (don't remember)
[05:26:09] <EchoAlpha> Heh me neither :b VERY rarely use z-index
[05:26:46] <EchoAlpha> Not working either at 1 :/
[05:27:00] <callumacrae> 0 is the background, 1 is the foreground, iirc
[05:31:08] <samssh> Some peeps need to read the MDN on z-index...
[05:31:27] <samssh> You're all off more than a little.
[05:32:05] <samssh> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index
[05:34:13] <EchoAlpha> samssh: Just read that thanks :) Didn't fix my issue tho :(
[05:36:48] <samssh> Also have look here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
[05:37:23] <samssh> I'm completely unfamiliar with the drag and drop stuff, so I'm afraid I can't help you there.
[05:37:52] <EchoAlpha> Whokai, thanks anyways! :)
[05:50:08] <tty> i want to inject a top navigation bar in cross domain servers/apps using the minimum code. for now i am linking an external css on top and a js file (two js with jquery if it is not included by the app) which appends an external html after the <body> tag. is there any better way to do this? i could use one or two parameters for instance altering the navigation bar’s color or something or even some <li>’s in it using an array or something. what do you think?
[05:52:21] <Cork> tty: do you really need to include jquery?
[05:52:40] <Cork> it is usually a pain if third party libs randomly inject jquery in a page
[05:53:08] <tty> Cork: well i am including a script tag on the bottom of each app with this http://pastebin.com/uzjxJQ8D
[05:53:29] <tty> it’s fine by me if i can do this without jquey.
[05:53:31] <Cork> so you need jquery for the ajax part?
[05:53:36] <Cork> and nothing else?
[05:53:47] <Cork> i would definitely think about using pure js then
[05:54:02] <tty> yes. and dom manipulation (to put the remote html part immediately after <body>
[05:54:03] <Cork> ?mdn xmlhttprequest
[05:54:04] <b-ot> Cork: XMLHttpRequest - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[05:54:18] <Cork> tty: your using native js in the pb
[05:54:26] <Cork> document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', html); <-- this isn't jquery
[05:55:27] <tty> Cork: ok will this work for remote html? on another server? (i have enabled CORS)
[05:55:52] <Cork> tty: $.ajax uses xhr behind the seen
[05:56:04] <Cork> cores headers if that is what you mean works inside the browser
[05:56:08] <Cork> jquery doesn't have to care
[05:56:48] <Cork> tty: if you had used jsonp though that would have been a totally different matter
[05:59:00] <tty> Cork: jsonp to avoid XMLHttpRequest warning/error?
[05:59:29] <tty> how would this be different? i can redesign it if you have any better idea
[06:01:17] <tty> what do you have in mind when mentioning jsonp?
[06:03:09] <tty> the nav bar includes 5 links or so to other apps tha also will have the navbar at the top. (1) it would be awesome if i couldindicate current active “tab/app” which i am doing so now with javascript checking for self.location.href. (2) it would be really awesome if i could rely on somethinh to build a global chat on that bar.
[06:08:50] <mooncup> is there a way to access the selector of an input that triggers an autocomplete?
[06:09:02] <mooncup> I want to basically call $(this) from within the select function
[06:27:20] <Cork> mooncup: try event.target
[06:27:22] <Cork> it might do it
[06:27:37] <Cork> but not sure
[06:28:14] <mooncup> I decided to to use 2 separate autocompletes in the end
[06:28:16] <mooncup> but thanks cork
[06:28:21] <mooncup> I shall try that next time
[06:28:58] <tty> Cork: plus, in the iframe for the nav bar can i include <html> and <link> tags for including css?
[06:29:38] <Cork> tty: ah, i didn't think you used an iframe
[06:29:51] <Cork> tty: if you use an iframe it is a completely separate page
[06:30:05] <Cork> so it is completely independent of the current page
[06:30:48] <tty> Cork: can i also limit the iframe to top (width:100% and height: 40px) and leave the rest of the page with no frames at all?
[06:31:12] <Cork> tty: the page inside the iframe can't control the iframe
[06:31:19] <Cork> unless it is on the same domain that is
[06:31:37] <Cork> then it can do wanky things like reaching into the parent and selecting the iframe there
[06:32:37] <tty> so having an iframe on top with 5 links pointing on cros domain web sites will not redirect to the “Site 1”, “Site 2” ?
[06:33:03] <tty> but will update the iframe rednering the site 1 inside that top iframe (40px height) ?
[06:33:03] <Cork> tty: they can
[06:33:14] <Cork> but you have to set a target="" attribute on the link
[06:33:34] <Cork> target="_top" to be precise
[06:42:33] <bbclover> hi guys, when using $.get() and an error occurs, do you automatically get some error log in console or something?
[06:43:04] <Cork> bbclover: if it is a network error you get the normal network error reporting
[06:43:17] <Cork> bbclover: if it is script error, then no you need to bind the .fail handler
[06:44:52] <bbclover> is this the reguler way to do the get: $.get(url, {x: x})?
[06:45:01] <bbclover> or do I not need the { } if I'm not passing multiple objects?
[06:45:31] <bbclover> and will this data default to being passed as json? I am getting json from the server
[06:45:37] <Cork> bbclover: you need the object
[06:45:42] <Cork> or it needs to be a param string
[06:46:01] <Cork> "value=a&else=option"
[06:46:20] <bbclover> what do you mean?
[06:46:29] <Cork> url param string
[06:46:41] <bbclover> yeah, what about it?
[06:46:53] <Cork> bbclover: you need the object <--
[06:46:55] <Cork> url param string <--
[06:47:00] <Cork> one or the other
[06:47:06] <bbclover> I have the object, it's x
[06:47:24] <bbclover> but I mean in $.ajax({}); I had to tell it dataType: "json", or something
[06:47:29] <bbclover> is it inferred here?
[06:47:32] <Cork> yes
[06:47:37] <bbclover> to be json?
[06:47:44] <bbclover> 2_b_jason - 2015
[06:47:46] <Cork> the second argument $.get is data not options
[06:48:16] <bbclover> right, so is {x: x} the proper way to form that second argument, even if you're just passing one object?
[06:48:19] <Cork> bbclover: dataType: "json" affects the accept header the browser sends to the server
[06:48:28] <Cork> and no $.get doesn't set that automatically
[06:48:53] <Cork> dataType does NOT affect how jquery handle the data sent back from the server
[06:49:15] <bbclover> ohhh so datatype tells you to give the data as json or whatever
[06:49:29] <bbclover> but here I'm not telling it that, so it's going to default to json? what if I needed it to be xml?
[06:49:36] <Cork> if the server supports multiple types with the same url yes
[06:49:51] <bbclover> I have apache tomcat as my server, do you know of it?
[06:50:08] <Cork> i have, but never used it
[06:50:25] <bbclover> have you ever used apache http server?
[06:50:31] <Cork> sure
[06:50:51] <Cork> but apache isn't an active server it just sends data
[06:50:58] <bbclover> when you use that, you put it your ip and some port I imagine, if you make that port outward facing, can anyone go to your site locally hosted on your computer?
[06:51:13] <Cork> sure
[06:51:24] <bbclover> what do you mean it isn't an active server?
[06:51:39] <Cork> bbclover: plain simple apache, with no plugins (like php)
[06:51:43] <Cork> only servs files
[06:51:48] <Cork> you can't script server side
[06:52:18] <bbclover> oh... you can just serve html files with javascript in them or something?
[06:52:31] <Cork> ya, and images and so on
[06:52:47] <bbclover> so you can't make ajax calls?
[06:53:00] <Cork> you can request static data through ajax
[06:53:12] <Cork> but dataType is kinda pointless
[06:53:46] <bbclover> why is that? your server can interpret the truth?
[06:53:48] <Cork> unless you use url rewrite that is
[06:54:09] <Cork> bbclover: you request url will get apache to open a file
[06:54:21] <Cork> this file extension has mappings in apache to what mime type it is
[06:54:32] <Cork> and that mimetype is what apache sends (if it know what type it is)
[06:57:40] <bbclover> I see... thanks for the info Cork!!!

[07:45:21] <nocturn> Hi, I'm using Jquery with Twitter bootstrap.  When I inlcude jquery in my page, the browser requires flash.  Is this normal?  Can I disable that?
[07:47:24] <NoiseEee_> im not sure what you mean by 'including jquery' and certainly it is not normal nocturn
[07:48:49] <ashopin> Hello all.
[07:49:10] <nocturn> NoiseEee_, with this  line: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[07:49:25] <ashopin> Is there a way to check if another JS file is loaded before performing a function? The issue I have is that I'm trying to move a <div> but another file loads after that moves it somewhere else
[07:49:33] <ashopin> I can't change the load order of the JS files.
[07:49:44] <nocturn> with it, the page requests the flash plugin from the browser, though it works fine with it blocked
[07:52:03] <NoiseEee_>  nocturn: nothing about that line uses or initiates or does anything remotely involved with flash
[07:52:18] <NoiseEee_> nocturn: something else in your code might be using flash if it detects jquery perhaps...
[07:57:04] <nocturn> NoiseEee_, I have angular with some modules, bootstrap and jquery, so it may be angular...
[08:04:21] <ilhami> hey

[09:35:12] <alex________> I have a div with a bunch of links it it. How can I select it. I fee like $(‘#mydiv’).find(‘a’) would work
[09:35:19] <alex________> but do I need an href in there somewhere?
[09:35:36] <robertmaxrees> select what?
[09:35:38] <robertmaxrees> a specific link?
[09:36:03] <alex________> robertmaxrees: well actually I want to select all of the links inside of that div. or loop through them
[09:36:14] <robertmaxrees> then what you've got is fine.
[09:36:14] <crillegustafsson> Hi ?

[09:37:45] <crillegustafsson> thx =)
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> same the way you do it in CSS.
[10:00:23] <arthurvr> Hey guys! What’s up today?
[10:00:50] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyyy
[10:06:52] <Omar-> hey arthurvr long time no see
[10:07:03] <Omar-> hey BillCriswell
[10:07:08] <arthurvr> Hey Omar- BillCriswell! How are you guys doing?
[10:07:14] <BillCriswell> Hellooooo
[10:07:16] <BillCriswell> Good.
[10:07:16] <Omar-> i'm great and you?
[10:07:32] <BillCriswell> Continuing to learn Vue.
[10:07:38] <arthurvr> Everything goin’ well :)
[10:07:53] <arthurvr> Vue is freakin’ awesome
[10:08:02] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Agreed.
[10:08:20] <BillCriswell> It's like Backbone and Angular made a sexy baby.
[10:08:20] <Omar-> i'm playing with reddit and imgur API
[10:08:37] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: lol :)
[10:09:12] <BillCriswell> Using it for a kiosk I'm building. So far so good.
[10:09:32] <arthurvr> At first I didn’t like vue, but now I should say it does feel good
[10:10:04] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: It was the only MV whatever whatever I enjoyed immediately.
[10:10:06] <Omar-> looks interesting
[10:10:55] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Yeah, I dig it.
[10:11:09] <arthurvr> Sure, awesomesauce it is
[10:11:13] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/vuejs/vue-component-compiler especially with this, blowing my mind
[10:11:45] <Omar-> BillCriswell i'll read it about. I want to try it with jQM + reddit
[10:17:33] <ilhami> I suck so much at jQuery and JS.
[10:18:53] <addama> Why's that?
[10:19:13] <robertmaxrees> me too ;)
[10:19:14] <teknolust> if it makes you feel better I'm probably worse lol
[10:19:26] <teknolust> just barely scratching the surface of it
[10:19:58] <teknolust> but at least you're here in this channel to try and learn
[10:20:18] <ilhami> addama, I am simply not good at it.
[10:20:20] <ilhami> sorry to say.
[10:20:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll learn.
[10:20:38] <addama> ^ Exactly
[10:20:54] <robertmaxrees> there are things i am absolutely terrible with when it comes to JS.
[10:21:09] <ilhami> I hope I will learn.
[10:21:25] <addama> Once you hit that one thing you're missing, whatever it is, it'll seem silly that you thought it was difficult. That comes mainly with practice, though
[10:21:42] <ilhami> It's fine to use the next() function right?
[10:22:02] <robertmaxrees> ilhami sure - it exists, though i tend to avoid it.
[10:22:54] <ilhami> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4b53b43917287bc983ff I also think it looks bad
[10:22:59] <ilhami> and non-descriptive.
[10:23:01] <Omar-> ilhami practice, practice, practice
[10:23:13] <ilhami> but it works.
[10:23:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not too bad.
[10:23:52] <ilhami> I just want to toggle profile description on image click.
[10:24:02] <Omar-> robertmaxrees btw, I've fixed yesterday's checkboxes issue
[10:24:43] <robertmaxrees> ilhami i usually avoid things like .next() because it relies on the markup being in a certain order, which means that code will break on a minor redesign.
[10:24:56] <ilhami> yeah that's what I thought as well.
[10:25:27] <ilhami> let me play a bit with this :)
[10:25:35] <ilhami> I think I can do this in a smarter way.
[10:40:07] <skypce> guys
[10:40:11] <skypce> what is wrong with this?
[10:40:13] <skypce>             $('#sidr').css('left', '-100%').toggle('fast').animate({
[10:40:18] <skypce> the animation is very slow
[10:40:43] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ skypce
[10:40:43] <b-ot> skypce: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:41:34] <Guddu> Could http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ be used to pick a year only?
[10:41:35] <Guddu> My Use Case is a Vehicle Database Screen where I need to specify the Year of Model of a Car
[10:43:07] <robertmaxrees> Guddu that kind of defeats the purpose of using the jqui dataepicker.
[10:43:15] <robertmaxrees> you'd wind up with a date dropdown.
[10:55:03] <alex________> I have this: var a_href = $(this).find('a'); console.log(typeof a_href); and it just gives me [Object object]. if there are multiple links on the page, what type would a_href be? how could I loop through each of them?
[10:55:21] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.
[10:55:29] <robertmaxrees> you can use a_href.each();
[10:55:42] <robertmaxrees> though with most jquery methods you don't actually need to do any looping.
[11:09:26] <_eddy> i always see something like this around some js script http://kopy.io/AynAn
[11:09:29] <_eddy> what is it for>
[11:09:51] <robertmaxrees> those are conditional comments.
[11:10:16] <robertmaxrees> for IE - so certain versions will run some code that doesn't effect other browsers.
[11:11:37] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: thanks I am trying to optimized my website and that is getting flagged up
[11:11:50] <robertmaxrees> you should generally avoid using them when possible.
[11:12:42] <alex________> robertmaxrees: so with this: https://bpaste.net/show/bdf5a627e41b I am looking at each a element right? but it doesn’t log anything here. Am I doint this right?
[11:13:17] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[11:13:46] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: the one that surprised me is this message
[11:13:47] <_eddy> JSC_PARSE_ERROR: Parse error. primary expression expected at line 3 character 1 in
[11:14:05] <_eddy> and it is pointing to "!" in <!DOCTYPE html>
[11:14:17] <addama> Instead of relying on this, maybe use the .each() parameters to talk to the element directly?
[11:14:32] <robertmaxrees> alex________ also, is your js in a document ready or included after your html?
[11:15:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/ works
[11:22:39] <alex________> robertmaxrees: yeah. Im using the phantomjs framework. I think something there is messing it up. good to know my jquery is correct though
[11:24:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you planning on doing with the .each btw?
[11:25:04] <alex________> robertmaxrees: I want them to click. click on each link in the table
[11:25:15] <robertmaxrees> who to click?
[11:25:25] <alex________> I am testing the ui for a webpage I am making
[11:25:28] <alex________> me to click
[11:27:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m3ovrhbq/
[11:27:29] <robertmaxrees> don't need to use .each for that.
[11:28:36] <needshelp2> hi everyone
[11:28:54] <u_name> check it out
[11:28:59] <u_name> http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/books/7933/exclusive-extract-from-jon-ronson-book-so-youve-been-publicly-shamed/
[11:29:05] <u_name> exclusive interview with dongle man
[11:29:08] <robertmaxrees> u_name ...
[11:29:13] <robertmaxrees> not really the right place.
[11:29:38] <_eddy> what can I use to make my js files more smaller to load page faster
[11:29:39] <_eddy> ?
[11:29:49] <robertmaxrees> gzip and minifacation.
[11:30:07] <arthurvr> a nice build system, gzip, uglify and concatination.
[11:31:12] <needshelp2> robertmaxrees: You're the maintainer of this channel right? Do you know of any team members around here?
[11:31:25] <needshelp2> I had some questions around google summer of code
[11:31:25] <robertmaxrees> "maintainer"?  no.  i'm a mod.
[11:31:36] <robertmaxrees> you should go to #jquery-dev for those :)
[11:31:51] <needshelp2> Okay. Thank you.
[11:32:01] <_eddy> robertmaxrees: link please
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> _eddy huh?
[11:32:16] <_eddy> cant find a link via google just blogs
[11:32:27] <robertmaxrees> right.  there's no singular link.
[11:33:28] <robertmaxrees> gzip is a type of compression you should enable on your server.  there are tons of tools to do minifcation + concatenation.
[11:34:02] <arthurvr> _eddy: if you’re intersted in building up build systems, you can checkout gruntjs.com, http://gulpjs.com/ or http://broccolijs.com/.
[11:34:45] <arthurvr> _eddy: they provide easy-to-use plugins for things like minification, zopfli and more
[11:36:01] <arthurvr> _eddy: If you was talking about getting the size of jQuery itself down, checkout custom builds.
[11:36:10] <arthurvr> _eddy: https://github.com/jquery/jquery#custom-build-examples for quick of an example.
[11:37:47] <BillCriswell> Also gulp
[11:37:49] <BillCriswell> I liked gulp.
[11:37:53] <BillCriswell> likes*
[11:37:57] <arthurvr> I posted a link to gulp :)
[11:38:26] <BillCriswell> How the hell did I miss that.
[11:38:40] <BillCriswell> grunt and gulp look too much alike, that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.
[11:38:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:39:10] <arthurvr> these days I’d love to be able to use broccoli but lacks some critical plugins
[11:39:23] <BillCriswell> I haven't touched that one yet.
[11:39:28] <arthurvr> It’s freakin’ nice man
[11:39:31] <arthurvr> https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli
[11:39:46] <arthurvr> It’s trendy these days but just lacks some plugins.
[11:40:36] <BillCriswell> Haha I just got comfortable with gulp. I won't be looking at others for a while unless they're mighty attractive.
[11:40:47] <arthurvr> Sure
[11:42:16] <needshelp2> A while back I've been thinking about building grunt/gulp plugins. Anyone a nice example (preferably simple, I just want to know how it looks like)?
[11:42:58] <dropdrive> Hi, beginner question... there are times when I include jquery and the Sammy plugin on a page, but "$.sammy" is undefined while "window.Sammy" is defined.  Why might this be?  I load jquery before sammy, of course.
[11:43:28] <robertmaxrees> noconflict turned on?  multiple versions of jquery?  loading things async? etc.
[11:43:30] <BillCriswell> dropdrive: Sounds like Sammy isn't a jQuery plugin.
[11:44:14] <BillCriswell> needshelp2: I wrote a gulp plugin a little bit ago, not sure how well it's written compared to these standards though. https://github.com/crswll/gulp-notes
[11:44:19] <arthurvr> needshelp2: Yeah I have some really simple ones. https://github.com/arthurvr/grunt-strip-shebang and https://github.com/arthurvr/gulp-strip-shebang
[11:44:45] <dropdrive> BillCriswell: The thing is, *sometimes* $.sammy is defined, and at other times it isn't.  So I feel like I'm doing something wrong
[11:45:05] <dropdrive> robertmaxrees: Is there a way, in Chrome, to see all the JS that a page as loaded?
[11:45:12] <BillCriswell> Are you loading them asynchronously?
[11:45:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:45:29] <dropdrive> BillCriswell: It's just <script src=...> in <head>
[11:45:45] <dropdrive> So... I guess I don't know if that's async or not.
[11:46:03] <robertmaxrees> there's a network tab in the dev tools that you can filter down to just show script file,s but something seems amiss here.
[11:46:04] <BillCriswell> If it's just <script src="..."></script> it isn't.
[11:46:26] <BillCriswell> I agree with robertmaxrees though. Something seems off.
[11:46:50] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not loading jquery twice.
[11:47:00] <BillCriswell> Yeah that too.
[11:50:45] <alex________> robertmaxrees: so with this edit: http://jsfiddle.net/b24nqv5a/3/ it seems that nothing is logged on the page load. however when I click on that element, ‘hi’ is logged correctly. Does the .click() function only execute in certain conditions?
[11:51:03] <robertmaxrees> first off, that's not a document ready.
[11:51:14] <robertmaxrees> second off you need to bind the listener before you can trigger it.
[11:51:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/4/
[11:52:22] <alex________> I don’t see the difference. why is yours a document.ready but mine isn’t?
[11:52:30] <robertmaxrees> mine isn't.
[11:52:37] <robertmaxrees> but mine binds the listener before calling .click()
[11:52:50] <alex________> oh so you just flipped the order
[11:53:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:53:09] <robertmaxrees> also: is your js included at the bottom of the page?
[11:53:23] <alex________> yeah before the </body> close tag
[11:53:31] <robertmaxrees> alright cool.
[11:56:02] <alex________> robertmaxrees: so what does that (function($) thing do if its not a document.ready shorthand?
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> that's an iife.
[11:56:34] <robertmaxrees> creates a scope so you don't clobber global and, in this case, makes sure you can use $ instead of jQuery
[11:56:43] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I defintely need to put some time into that gulp-notes repo
[11:57:01] <arthurvr> oh yeah. Hope you didn’t take my comments bad :)
[11:57:17] <robertmaxrees> the equivalent document ready would be jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ });, but if your code is before the closing body tag you don't need it.
[11:57:28] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Haha not at all!
[11:57:37] <BillCriswell> I appreciate them.
[11:57:44] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: Also, publish it to npm man. Without publish it’s useless :)
[11:58:12] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I didn't want to do it till I Felt it was good enough (and i was more comfortable with the whole process).
[11:58:28] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: semver-wise publishing it doesn’t directly mean it’s stable.
[11:58:44] <arthurvr> I mean, the version number could just be 0.1 or 0.0.1
[11:58:45] <jeffreylevesque> if i have an ajax process that doesn't return data from the server, and assign it a deferred object, is wrong to do `deferred.done(function(data) { ... });`?
[11:58:57] <jeffreylevesque> should i not include `data` argument in done?
[11:59:05] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque if you don't need it, don't pass it.
[11:59:17] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I think I did whatever npm init gave me off the bat.
[11:59:20] <jeffreylevesque> will any errors popup, if i keep it in?
[11:59:39] <robertmaxrees> no, but would you declare varibales that you'd never use?
[11:59:40] <BillCriswell> I'll update it though, maybe tonight.
[11:59:44] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: You’re unfamiliar with npm I guess? npm init just creates a package.json but doesn’t publish anything yet.
[11:59:47] <jeffreylevesque> true
[11:59:50] <jeffreylevesque> thank you robertmaxrees
[11:59:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:00:00] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: I was aware of hat, but I meant with like the license and stuff.
[12:00:45] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: oh that way. Well talking about licencing you probably need a license file in the repo anyways.
[12:01:10] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: But this is getting really off-topic. Wanne talk about it somewhere else?
[12:01:24] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: oh btw I like gulp-notes :)
[12:01:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but later on, currently doing actual work stuff.
[12:01:36] <BillCriswell> Which sucks, but I need to get it done lol
[12:01:39] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: sure. ping me when you’re free
[12:01:44] <BillCriswell> Sounds good!
[12:01:53] <BillCriswell> and thanks!
[12:04:15] <alex________> I have 20 links that I want clicked 1 after the other and then when the 20’th is clicked, it starts all over again at the first one. What would be the best way to do this? I am reading about .setTimeout but that seems good only for 1 or 2 timeouts
[12:04:31] <robertmaxrees> what does clicking a link do?
[12:04:39] <robertmaxrees> a little more information would be helpful.
[12:04:48] <dropdrive> robertmaxrees: I was loading jquery twice :-(
[12:04:55] <robertmaxrees> dropdrive that'll do it :)
[12:05:24] <alex________> robertmaxrees it sends a big set of data yaml into a piece of software for it to use. each link sends a different set of yaml.
[12:05:36] <robertmaxrees> is it running ajax or anything like that?
[12:13:11] <microhaxo> I am losing my mind trying to get an image to Rotate and be left aligned and properly top aligned after rotating.. I am using Jquery rotate to rotate an image and the image rotates about the origin, the image is left aligned to the window and top aligned to begin with, so when i rotate the image 90 degrees the top now is off the page a bit, etc. I tried messign with margin-left etc for 50% of the image width and such but it doesn't
[12:17:40] <alex________> robertmaxrees: its a lot like ajax. a custom js library. but same idea - asynchronous sending of stuff when you click a button
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand waht that means, alex________
[12:21:05] <robertmaxrees> if it's sending things async, it's using ajax.
[12:22:18] <alex________> robertmaxrees: its a library called plasma. you can read about it here: http://www.oblong.com/g-speak/
[12:22:40] <alex________> on click, it sends a yaml data piece to a data pool where software sees it and does something
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> either way, that library should accept callbacks for when ajax callbacks complete.
[12:23:25] <u_name> alex________: http://jsfiddle.net/uLo3xzrp/
[12:24:04] <robertmaxrees> timeouts really aren't appropriate in this case because you can't guarantee that the ajax call as completed in time.
[12:25:32] <u_name> it answers his/her/its original question
[12:25:45] <alex________> lol thanks u_name
[12:25:58] <robertmaxrees> sure, it's one way to crack at it, but that can cause some pretty nasty bugs fwiw.
[12:25:59] <alex________> I am sentient
[12:26:06] <robertmaxrees> BUT WHAT DO I KNOW!?
[12:26:17] <u_name> alex________: np
[12:26:41] <u_name> robertmaxrees: you let other people worry about blank
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:26:59] <u_name> it's a futurama reference
[12:27:03] <robertmaxrees> kay
[12:29:40] <u_name> microhaxo: can you put your problem in a fiddle?
[12:45:07] <u_name> microhaxo: this? http://jsfiddle.net/dfh66yn6/1/
[12:46:57] <alex________> why can’t it be this easy? http://jsfiddle.net/b24nqv5a/5/
[12:48:14] <u_name> I thought you wanted them to click in sequence?
[12:48:41] <alex________> well that would be nice but not necessary
[12:48:56] <alex________> just as long as they don’t all click at the same exact tiem
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:50:52] <robertmaxrees> $('.scene a').on('click', function() { console.log(this) });
[12:51:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/6/
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> alex________ check the documentation for that ajax plugin - see if there's a callback available for when the ajax completes its run.
[12:52:35] <alex________> robertmaxrees: for that I get Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function on (index): 29
[12:53:09] <robertmaxrees> alex________ you have that before, as well :) this.click() won't work.
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> because 'this' isn't what you think it is.
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/7/ is one way around that.
[12:59:23] <u_name> alex________: http://jsfiddle.net/b24nqv5a/8/
[13:00:21] <robertmaxrees> u_name you've got undeclared vars in there btw.
[13:00:38] <cheebs> In an example such as the following : $el.load(url, callback).html("<span class=\"ajax-loader\">"), would the span tag be shown while the request is being made by load?
[13:00:38] <u_name> que?
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> u_name http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/9/
[13:01:22] <u_name> sorry, I'm from the land of coffee, I don't speak gibberish
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> if you don't declare a var using the var keyword, it's declared "globally", so you end up clobbering the global namespace.
[13:01:46] <u_name> (oh no he di'int)
[13:02:08] <u_name> I didn't know that, thanks
[13:02:31] <u_name> But considering it's wrapped in a $(), doesn't that make it a local variable?
[13:02:33] <robertmaxrees> cheebs it might?  i'm not sure.
[13:02:36] <robertmaxrees> u_name nope.
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> if you forget the var keyword, the js engine doesn't know what scope the var belongs to.
[13:03:01] <alex________> u_name: ohh this is really cool
[13:03:06] <robertmaxrees> so it declares it declared it globally.
[13:07:19] <alex________> u_name: still trying to figure it out. so where is links defined? links that gets fed into click_these
[13:07:55] <u_name> links is a jquery array of things you want to be clicked
[13:08:19] <u_name> it's the parameter for click_these
[13:08:22] <alex________> ohh I see. and it gets filled with $(‘.scene a’)
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> click_these($('.scene a')); <- here.
[13:08:33] <alex________> right
[13:09:45] <alex________> wow jquery is crazy
[13:09:55] <u_name> s/crazy/sexy/
[13:11:06] <alex________> s/sexy/makes me quiver
[13:12:24] <u_name> s/is //
[13:15:52] <u_name> do you know if it's possible to write coffeescript in jsfiddle?
[13:17:08] <u_name> disregard that, I'm a pleb

[14:34:44] <JZA> hi I am using jcarousellite, but I wonder if I can assign other things than UL -> Li
[14:34:59] <JZA> like instead being a DIV image holding the element.
[14:35:31] <u_name> have you tried?
[14:36:43] <JZA> u_name: well no, since I am not sure how to strictly call the class.
[14:37:17] <u_name> don't worry about it, what I asked was stupid anyways (now that I'm looking at its documentation)
[14:38:01] <JZA> all I have is the initial $(function() { $(".buttons").jCarouselLite({ btnNext: ".next", btnPrev: ".prev", visible: 2 }); });
[14:38:06] <u_name> I'm looking at the source now, and it looks like the ul's and li's are hardcoded
[14:38:33] <JZA> u_name: I see, thats too bad, any recomendation for other plugin?
[14:39:50] <u_name> no, I've failed you Jsama

[14:43:31] <u_name> then you paste the link and hope someone helps you
[14:46:45] <Guddu__> Could someone please tell me why this jsfiddle is showing an error in JS Console?

[14:47:51] <u_name> skypce: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/eqqfdgwy/
[14:48:28] <skypce> thank you u_name
[14:48:38] <u_name> np
[14:49:00] <u_name> Guddu__: your code is too ugly to tell
[14:49:19] <Guddu__> u_name, Why ugly? Its well formatted and minimal
[14:49:56] <Guddu__> May be I am missing some JS Include? JQuery UI?
[14:50:30] <u_name> it's too difficult to see what's going on
[14:51:08] <skypce> uname please see the right blue and gray menu http://skypce-sandbox.com/new/business.html#
[14:51:14] <P1RATEZ> guddu, set a breakpoint on the page with the code and trace it
[14:51:21] <skypce> u_name,  please see the right blue and gray menu http://skypce-sandbox.com/new/business.html#
[14:51:33] <skypce> the problem is the jquery affect all classes
[14:51:42] <skypce> see the arrow orange
[14:51:47] <skypce> please :)
[14:51:58] <Guddu__> P1RATEZ, I think I need to include JQueryui. Can i include that in a fiddle. Don't see it in dropdown though
[14:52:17] <u_name> Guddu__: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/63k2r3es/10/
[14:52:44] <P1RATEZ> its not in the drop down but there's a checkbox
[14:54:11] <Guddu__> Thanks u_name
[14:54:35] <Guddu__> Could someone please help me with this? I launch a modal A and on presssing ok on A i should see modal B but it is not showing up. http://jsfiddle.net/63k2r3es/12/
[14:54:38] <u_name> np
[14:54:53] <u_name> skypce: please isolate your problem into a workable example on jsfiddle.net
[14:58:10] <u_name> Guddu__: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/63k2r3es/14/
[14:58:46] <u_name> Your divs both had the id 'A'
[14:58:51] <Guddu__> Thanks u_name So here is my problem
[14:59:15] <Guddu__> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2r3es/15/
[15:00:00] <Guddu__> I launch a JQuery Modal Dialog A from Which I launch another modal dialog B when OK button is pressed  on A and if the user did not correctly respond to question on A. However, the code in Ok callback of Modal A is getting executed instead of me waiting to press Ok on Modal B. Is that even posssible?
[15:01:10] <u_name> It's because you're putting it in the click function of A
[15:01:12] <u_name> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/63k2r3es/16/
[15:03:31] <u_name> It's possible because javascript is asynchronous
[15:04:03] <u_name> showDialog doesn't finish executing before the engine moves to the next line
[15:04:55] <u_name> so you have to put your B ok code in the B dialog (which makes sense when you think about it)
[15:05:24] <skypce> how can i do soemthing jQuery("#myElementId").addClass('className').when(a element is clicked)
[15:07:02] <Guddu__> Thanks u_name I will use return in my logic to stop the engine to move to close. Sometimes the solution is so simple.
[15:07:08] <Guddu__> Thanks for guiding me today u_name
[15:09:48] <Guddu__> skypce, YOu can implement a click function
[15:10:52] <skypce> do you can show me a example
[15:13:01] <u_name> np Guddu__
[15:13:33] <Guddu__> skypce, http://jsfiddle.net/63k2r3es/18/
[15:16:47] <pcfreak30> What would the best way be to add slider allows to a jquery ui slider widget?
[15:16:52] <pcfreak30> arrows*
[15:20:14] <u_name> my initial feeling is css
[15:21:03] <u_name> can you give a little fiddle?
[15:21:31] <pcfreak30> my first attempt was a image before and after but it doesnt align right
[15:21:53] <pcfreak30> im looking now at customizing the ui widget to have inline relative elements before and after
[15:21:55] <u_name> don't use an image unless it's an svg
[15:22:00] <u_name> and even then
[15:22:04] <pcfreak30> right now
[15:22:06] <u_name> it's probably better to use font-awesome
[15:22:15] <pcfreak30> thats not really inportant
[15:22:33] <pcfreak30> this whole site will get remade in a few months, but i just have to make it work
[15:23:05] <u_name> can you put the problem in question in a fiddle?
[15:23:37] <skypce> guys
[15:23:39] <skypce> i am near
[15:23:39] <skypce> http://skypce-sandbox.com/new/business.html#
[15:23:46] <skypce> see the right sidebar menu
[15:23:59] <skypce> there have a problem yet
[15:24:09] <skypce> with the arrows
[15:24:17] <skypce> that not is the first element
[15:25:36] <u_name> what's wrong with the arrows?
[15:28:34] <skypce> works not fine
[15:32:07] <u_name> move the picture into the anchor tag then redo the rotation and styling
[15:33:09] <u_name> or you could also have the div containing the picture be a toggle (but that is ugly)
[15:33:22] <u_name> skypce:
[15:34:01] <pcfreak30> u_name: http://jsfiddle.net/remwf9ge/
[15:34:10] <pcfreak30> very crappy one
[15:34:58] <skypce> u_name,
[15:34:59] <skypce> please
[15:35:00] <skypce>     $(this).parent().parent().find('div img').addClass('rotate');
[15:35:06] <skypce> what is wrong with this'?
[15:35:39] <u_name> $($(this).parent().parent().find('div img')).addClass('rotate');
[15:35:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:35:54] <robertmaxrees> that's no different.
[15:36:42] <u_name> it's hard to help this guy, I don't think he knows how to put his stuff into a fiddle
[15:37:42] <pcfreak30> u_name: thats the same. putting a jq object in a selector does nothing but return the object back
[15:38:02] <u_name> (shrug)
[15:38:43] <robertmaxrees> skypce make a fiddle.
[15:42:43] <converge> does someone knows why my subscribe popup box disappear when I click in input box here www.fortunata.com.br
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> is that page ever gonna finish loading?
[15:44:13] <converge> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> converge mke a fiddle.
[15:44:42] <converge> fiddle ?
[15:44:48] <u_name> pcfreak30: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/remwf9ge/1/
[15:44:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ converge
[15:45:09] <robertmaxrees> a small, self-contained example is ideal.
[15:45:13] <Guddu__> If i have a form with id A and a input field id is N then what is the jQUery selector for it? $('#A') is to select the form. What should follow?
[15:45:27] <robertmaxrees> #('#A #N');
[15:45:34] <converge> robertmaxrees: its a wordpress plugin
[15:45:45] <robertmaxrees> or just $('#N'), Guddu__, since it's an ID.
[15:45:50] <robertmaxrees> and IDs are unique.
[15:45:52] <Guddu__> robertmaxrees, If i want to specify type also as input?
[15:46:00] <Guddu__> Thanks robertmaxrees
[15:46:02] <robertmaxrees> Guddu__ you don't need/want to.
[15:46:05] <robertmaxrees> just select the ID.
[15:46:08] <Guddu__> Agree
[15:47:07] <pcfreak30> u_name: yes but it has to be clickable. I dont think you can do onclick to pesudo elements
[15:47:43] <pcfreak30> Guddu__: jquery selectors are css selectors
[15:47:52] <robertmaxrees> CSS plus some.
[15:48:07] <pcfreak30> Guddu__: You can have .A, #A and input[name=A]
[15:48:17] <pcfreak30> All would work
[15:49:16] <u_name> pcfreak30: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/remwf9ge/2/
[15:49:17] <u_name> this?

[15:55:00] <u_name> maybe a little
[15:56:36] <u_name> pcfreak30: maybe reconsider using font-awesome?
[15:56:38] <u_name> http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/
[15:56:51] <u_name> you set it up once, and you get a ton of svg icons
[15:57:29] <u_name> and they're very pretty I might add

[16:08:25] <Guddu__> Design Question.
[16:08:25] <Guddu__> I have two dropdown lists on a modal page. For selecting Driver and Vehicle.
[16:08:25] <Guddu__> Both the driver and vehicle have a foreign key reference to the transporter company.
[16:08:25] <Guddu__> In the beginning i load all the Driver and Vehicles that are present in the system.
[16:08:25] <Guddu__> The vehicle drop down list has this format
[16:08:25] <Guddu__> Vehicle Plate Number : Transporter Company Name
[16:08:27] <Guddu__> The Conductor drop down list has this format
[16:08:29] <Guddu__> Conductor Name : Transporter Company Name
[16:08:31] <Guddu__> I want that when I select a Vehicle, Only the Drivers pertaining to that transporter show up in the list. Is this possible using JQuery?
[16:10:18] <skypce> guy
[16:10:20] <skypce> guys
[16:10:25] <skypce> with this selector works fine
[16:10:25] <skypce>      $(this).parent().parent().find('div img').toggleClass('rotate');
[16:10:27] <skypce> but
[16:10:46] <skypce> no i need add when expanded the .rotate-reset class
[16:11:08] <quuxman> hey I'm having issues with my resize handler manipulating a <canvas> drawing context, that gets clobbered afterwards by the <canvas> resetting its state after a resize. Is there a way I can set a handler with jquery to be called _after_ the built-in <canvas> resize code gets called and clobbers everything?
[16:12:10] <u_name> Guddu__: yes
[16:12:40] <Guddu__> u_name, How shall we approach this?
[16:13:27] <robertmaxrees> skypce make a fiddle.
[16:13:37] <skypce> too much work robbyoconnor
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> not sure how else to phrase that.
[16:13:41] <skypce> too much work robertmaxrees
[16:13:46] <scrandaddy> Hey there. I'm calling (after the dom is ready) $('body').on('click', function(){...}) in my code, which isn't getting events. However if I do the same thing in the console it handles events. Is there something I'm missing?
[16:13:48] <robertmaxrees> then we can't help.
[16:13:57] <pcfreak30> How do I trigger a slide event in juery ui
[16:14:14] <pcfreak30> .trigger('slide') doesnt seem to work
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy try $(document) instead of body
[16:15:12] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: no luck
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> share your code in a fiddle?
[16:16:23] <scrandaddy> https://jsfiddle.net/vpdLe6mg/
[16:16:48] <skypce> hey
[16:17:14] <skypce> how can i do a if class is showed?
[16:17:20] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy that's not a document ready. https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpdLe6mg/1/
[16:17:25] <robertmaxrees> skypce .hasClass()\
[16:17:31] <skypce> great
[16:17:35] <skypce> thank you robertmaxrees
[16:18:09] <quuxman> My current hack, which is ugly, and draws a few frames in the wrong spot is: get element width; set width and height attrs; setTimeout on translating to center and scaling
[16:19:50] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: thanks! but still doesn't work :(
[16:20:31] <robertmaxrees> it works in the fiddle if you include jquery...
[16:20:45] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:21:10] <scrandaddy> none
[16:21:24] <scrandaddy> this is on a third-party page though, perhaps they are overriding some of the click handlers
[16:21:24] <robertmaxrees> and you changed it to $().ready( ?
[16:21:29] <scrandaddy> yeah
[16:21:43] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, they might be smashing things on their end.
[16:22:21] <scrandaddy> is there a convenient way to get in front of anything they might be doing?
[16:22:36] <robertmaxrees> not without pissing them off ;)
[16:22:44] <scrandaddy> haha, fair enough
[16:22:47] <robertmaxrees> you can abuse the event queues, but that might have inintended side effects.
[16:23:10] <skypce> guys
[16:23:15] <skypce> what is wrong with this please?
[16:23:15] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/YDz9ufHu
[16:23:17] <scrandaddy> i didn't realize you could just block ALL clicks
[16:23:22] <checkit> I need to borrow your expertise jquery community. Check this out, see if you can offer me any advise: http://jsfiddle.net/h2uvy8rw/
[16:23:30] <checkit> undefined is not a funciton ^
[16:23:42] <scrandaddy> probably means they're doing a preventDefault() inside of their own $(document).on('click')?
[16:24:19] <alex________> I need to select 2 elements with 1 jquery statement. this is u_name ’s modified code http://jsfiddle.net/b24nqv5a/13/ . when I try using a comma, it gives “uncaught range error: maximum call stack size exceeded”
[16:24:25] <alex________> what should I be using instead of commas?
[16:24:25] <scrandaddy> also, shouldn't my console handlers also not work? that's the part that gets me
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy there could be all sorts of things going on there.
[16:24:52] <robertmaxrees> alex________ $('.scene a, .act a')
[16:24:57] <robertmaxrees> it's one string, not two.
[16:25:24] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: i'll conclude that it's a fubar situation then. thanks :)
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> checkit because there's so string .splice
[16:25:40] <robertmaxrees> *no
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> use JSON.parse() against it and interact with it like it's an array.
[16:26:11] <alex________> robertmaxrees: ok that gets rid of the range error, http://jsfiddle.net/b24nqv5a/14/ but its only logging stuff from scene instead of act.
[16:26:31] <robertmaxrees> right, because of $('.scene a').on('click', function() {
[16:26:49] <alex________> ohhh
[16:27:23] <robertmaxrees> also you want to fix up those var declarationbs in that.
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b24nqv5a/18/
[16:32:04] <alex________> robertmaxrees: oooh thanks!
[16:37:23] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Sorry, that wasn't supposed to be a string: http://jsfiddle.net/h2uvy8rw/1/
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> splice only exists for arrays.
[16:38:57] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish here?
[16:40:12] <checkit> Shit... Essentially, I need to remove the Primary or Secodary index if they don't have any data...
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> O.o why?
[16:40:33] <robertmaxrees> the contract of that object would be that they have them.
[16:43:46] <u_name> robertmaxrees: my fiddle opens in a new window. how do I make it stop that?

[16:52:12] <u_name> the code assumes there are no duplicate license plates
[16:52:25] <Guddu__> Yes. They will be always unique
[16:52:25] <u_name> it's not invalid, i'm just cluttering up the namespace
[16:52:43] <robertmaxrees> actually not declaring this with var is invalid.
[16:52:59] <u_name> oh… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> *things with
[16:53:14] <Guddu__> But I should be able to adapt it to my business logic if needed. You practically wrote the whole code for me.
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s03f0pbw/3/ cleaned up
[16:53:57] <u_name> hoho, look at all of that syntax highlighting
[16:54:19] <u_name> Guddu__: np
[16:54:29] <u_name> http://i.do.it.for.the.motherland.jpg.to
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:54:36] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:54:40] <robertmaxrees> not cool duder.
[16:54:51] <u_name> you expected it about as much as I did
[16:54:56] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:54:57] <robertmaxrees> what
[16:55:04] <u_name> http://this.gives.you.the.first.google.image.result.jpg.to
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> and you're responsible for whatever that image winds up being ;)
[16:55:30] <u_name> http://true.story.jpg.to
[16:55:58] <robertmaxrees> sio if you're not sure what the image is going to be, i'd avoid using it :)
[16:56:08] <u_name> or double check it in a browser before use
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> whichever.
[16:56:29] <robertmaxrees> all i care is that you don't put NSFW content into the channel.
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[16:56:40] <u_name> a very reasonable rule
[16:57:26] <u_name> I wonder why that was the first result
[17:00:54] <u_name> wait...
[17:01:04] <u_name> robertmaxrees: "!=" != "!=="
[17:01:05] <u_name> ?
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:01:22] <u_name> then what does != do?
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> != is "not equals" with coercion.
[17:02:04] <robertmaxrees> !== doesn't coerce
[17:02:42] <u_name> I'm only vaguely familiar with the term coerce
[17:02:53] <u_name> i'm googlin'
[17:03:00] <robertmaxrees> '5' == 5 vs '5' === 5
[17:03:12] <robertmaxrees> the first one is true, the second is false.
[17:03:20] <u_name> oh… neato
[17:03:29] <robertmaxrees> always use strict equality
[17:03:46] <u_name> why?
[17:04:04] <u_name> I guess it makes sure you know what's in your variables
[17:04:06] <robertmaxrees> makes your code prone to less bugs, plus a nice little speed side benefit.
[17:04:23] <robertmaxrees> not a HUGE speed boost, but it's there.
[17:04:42] <u_name> shouldn't the roles of == and === be switched?
[17:04:53] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[17:05:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean shouldn't == be without coercion?
[17:05:26] <u_name> Offhand I would guess that == is strict and === is loose
[17:05:36] <robertmaxrees> heritage mostly.
[17:05:49] <u_name> this is why I coffeescript
[17:06:06] <u_name> damned be your triple equal signs and your vars
[17:06:07] <robertmaxrees> the original language design was with only == and was loose.  browser vendors then tried to change it but IE pushed back because of the number of sites that would break
[17:06:41] <robertmaxrees> so === was added and now we get to have the oh so fun convo all the time.
[17:07:10] <u_name> http://sou.desu.ka.jpg.to/
[17:07:58] <u_name> no worries, coffeescript is taking over and javascript will go the way of the flash drive
[17:08:09] <robertmaxrees> except exactly the opposite is happening ;)
[17:08:18] <robertmaxrees> less and less people are adapting cfscript because of ES6
[17:08:34] <u_name> s/adapting/adopting/ ?
[17:08:41] <robertmaxrees> *adopting, yeah.
[17:09:48] <u_name> Have you used it?
[17:10:08] <u_name> it says it's scheduled for release in mid2015
[17:10:14] <robertmaxrees> es6?
[17:10:18] <u_name> yea
[17:10:33] <robertmaxrees> a bit, yeah.  i have to support older browsers so I won't be able to reap the benefits for a while.
[17:10:43] <robertmaxrees> without using transpilers
[17:11:36] <u_name> ECMAScript Harmony
[17:11:52] <u_name> I'll reserve my judgement
[17:12:06] <robertmaxrees> there are some good improvements and some not so good improvements.
[17:12:28] <u_name> I see they're using the -> syntax, so that's a plus
[17:12:43] <u_name> I don't see anything about optional parenthesis
[17:12:46] <robertmaxrees> =>
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> and a lot of the basics are still there.
[17:12:55] <u_name> http://orly.jpg.to
[17:13:00] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[17:13:29] <u_name> how do you change scoping then?
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> not sure if i follow.
[17:13:47] <skypce> guys
[17:13:52] <u_name> in coffeescript, -> vs =>
[17:13:52] <skypce> help me with this please
[17:13:53] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/iCW8Ukfe
[17:14:02] <skypce> i need on double click back to rotate 0
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> u_name not sure i know what the difference is in coffeescript - elaborate?
[17:14:48] <u_name> so in coffeescript, => passes in the scope
[17:14:58] <u_name> i'll make a fiddle
[17:15:07] <u_name> a picture is worth a thousand words
[17:15:14] <robertmaxrees> uh okay
[17:15:51] <notchris-home> hey robertmaxrees good evening
[17:16:00] <morenoh149> if jquery.ajaxSetup is discouraged what's the suggested approach? http://devdocs.io/jquery/jquery.ajaxsetup
[17:18:26] <robertmaxrees> u_name it looks like in coffeescript -> creates a new function and then declares all new vars explicitly in the scope, whereas => declars all vars in that scope?
[17:18:29] <u_name> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/khdmetph/
[17:18:49] <rcyr> morenoh149: The suggested approach to what?
[17:18:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful heh
[17:19:25] <u_name> when you call bar, everything that was in 'this' is passed to the function
[17:19:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not how the docs explain it.
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> looks like an implicit .bind()
[17:20:22] <u_name> I could've understood it wrong
[17:20:25] <morenoh149> rcyr: to setup ajax setting you want used for all ajax communications in your app. Did you read the link?
[17:20:44] <rcyr> morenoh149: Sure, it doesn't tell me why you need it though.
[17:20:44] <robertmaxrees> morenoh149 you can create a default settings object and toss that around instead.
[17:21:00] <u_name> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/khdmetph/1/
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> u_name i read the docs.
[17:21:12] <rcyr> (I never used ajaxsetup, ever.)
[17:21:12] <morenoh149> robertmaxrees: cool. So a json object in the window object?
[17:21:33] <u_name> k
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd namespace it, morenoh149
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> and avoid making it global if you don't need to.
[17:46:07] <Guddu__> 1500 items in a select search dropdown is slwoing it down like hell
[17:46:19] <robertmaxrees> well i mean...
[17:46:57] <tasaif> one optimization you can do is to use a hash instead of arrays
[17:47:08] <tasaif> you could set up a hierarchical structure
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> or, y'know, not use 1500 items at once.
[17:47:51] <tasaif> data { foreign_key: { vehicles: {foo}, drivers: {bar}}}
[17:48:23] <tasaif> or like robertmaxrees said, not using 1500 things at once
[17:48:31] <tasaif> both reasonable
[17:49:05] <Guddu__> Yes. Will try to think of a alternative. May be a ajax call to get data from the DB based o what user enters in the Text Field
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:49:11] <robertmaxrees> do that.
[17:49:54] <tasaif> or if you want a REALLY shitty way to do it, you could create the dom objects beforehand and hide and show them based on selection
[17:50:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to fix the problem.
[17:51:07] <tasaif> $("select.drivers[key='foo']").show()
[17:51:41] <tasaif> with a $("select.drivers").hide() done before the show
[17:52:27] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you're trying to get at.
[17:53:27] <tasaif> yea, it's silly, but it would definitely relieve some of the stress of walking the array
[17:53:47] <tasaif> actually, it would remove the walking part entirely
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> shove it serverside and wash your hands of it.
[17:54:31] <tasaif> personally, I think it belongs client side
[17:54:41] <robertmaxrees> that much data never belongs client side.
[17:55:19] <tasaif> 1 query beats multiple queries
[17:55:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:55:45] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern.
[17:55:54] <robertmaxrees> deferred loading is another great thing.
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> lots of arguments to move it server-side.
[17:56:23] <tasaif> it's a pick your poison scenario
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> i think it's pretty cut and dry, but ok.
[17:56:44] <tasaif> well duh, I think it's pretty cut and dry too lol
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> i really can't think of a case where having 1500 things shoved at the client like that is the preferred scenario.
[17:57:01] <rbo> lol
[17:58:06] <tasaif> Depends on if you're the client or the server
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:58:19] <robertmaxrees> for end users.
[17:58:42] <tasaif> The end user has to have a smooth experience regardless
[17:58:46] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:58:59] <tasaif> the question is does it belong in the browser or the server
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> so do things to achieve that.  like not throwing 1500 things at the client for them to process.
[17:59:18] <tasaif> or process them in a smart way
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> that starts getting into "cutesy tricks" territory.
[18:00:14] <pcfreak30> http://dev.financer.se/, could anyone tell me why the tabs here are so screwed up. need to move a slider to see it
[18:00:17] <robertmaxrees> let the js handle the client-side display stuff.  that's what it's good at.  then you can have a robust server-side filtering solution.
[18:00:30] <tasaif> to each his own
[18:00:38] <rbo> o_O
[18:00:58] <tasaif> pcfreak30: i get a login screen
[18:01:08] <pcfreak30> tasaif: IMHO use server to return JSON
[18:01:15] <pcfreak30> tasaif: h/o
[18:02:07] <tasaif> oh my, how could I have been so stupid. you're right, just have the server return JSON, why didn't I think of that?
[18:02:22] <pcfreak30> tasaif: try now
[18:02:40] <pcfreak30> tasaif: that scarcasm?
[18:02:55] <tasaif> yea, but I'm just foolin'
[18:03:04] <tasaif> json is great
[18:03:24] <pcfreak30> TBH I use json and handlebars/mustache on ajax html
[18:04:58] <skypce> hello help me i pay 10 usd when my client pay me
[18:05:18] <robertmaxrees> skypce not the right place.
[18:05:22] <robertmaxrees> ask in a freelance channel.
[18:05:39] <tasaif> pcfreak30: something to do with padding
[18:05:42] <tasaif> it's very strange
[18:05:46] <pcfreak30> or use something like freelancer.com
[18:06:03] <pcfreak30> tasaif: setting li to inline partly fixes it
[18:06:21] <rbo> ok
[18:07:33] <tasaif> yea… it's strange. it looks like your li's have a negative margin or something
[18:08:00] <tasaif> wait....
[18:08:04] <tasaif> your text is white
[18:08:19] <rbo> lol
[18:08:45] <tasaif> found it
[18:08:53] <tasaif> your li:before has a margin-left of -30px
[18:09:54] <pcfreak30> :/
[18:11:18] <pcfreak30> tasaif: so .ui-tabs-nav li{ margin: auto;  }
[18:12:14] <tasaif> whatever works for you
[18:12:22] <pcfreak30>  .ui-tabs-nav li:before{ margin: auto;  }
[18:12:27] <tasaif> Are you doing the styling yourself?
[18:12:38] <tasaif> specifically the colorS?
[18:13:13] <pcfreak30> im modifying code soup
[18:13:21] <tasaif> how fun
[18:13:32] <pcfreak30> when this site profits wnough ill be hired to take a wreaking ball to it
[18:13:50] <tasaif> http://cheers.jpg.to
[18:13:56] <pcfreak30> but im hacking code written in non english and just trying to get it to be sane
[18:14:14] <tasaif> maybe the background color of the anchor tag could be set instead of the li itself
[18:14:45] <pcfreak30> well the styling on the tabs i didnt do
[18:14:51] <pcfreak30> jquery ui was already in use
[18:15:10] <tasaif> and the styling was done with a theme I guess?
[18:15:53] <pcfreak30> seems so
[18:16:45] <tasaif> if you wanted to keep the arrow outside maybe you could keep the :before at -30px and then have a +30px on the rest of the content to balance it
[18:17:32] <pcfreak30> tasaif: on my screen the arrows are fine for now
[18:17:49] <tasaif> http://okely.dokely.neighborino.jpg.to
[18:17:51] <pcfreak30> im just going down my task checklist to get most of it done tonight
[18:20:30] <robertmaxrees> alright folks, enjoy.

[20:28:17] <forQuery> SOS to anyone.  It's my first time using irc.  Is my signal coming though?
[20:29:14] <forQuery> anyone hearing this?
[20:29:17] <forQuery> i think im on mute
[20:29:18] <forQuery> sigh....
[20:29:39] <forQuery>  start: function( event, ui )
[20:29:39] <forQuery>         {
[20:29:39] <forQuery>             $ui_helper.parent().append("<div class='ds-panel-over'></div>");
[20:29:39] <forQuery>         },
[20:29:39] <forQuery>         stop: function( event, ui )
[20:29:39] <forQuery>         {
[20:29:39] <forQuery>             $(".ds-panel-over", $(ui.helper).parent()).remove();
[20:29:40] <forQuery>         },
[20:29:47] <forQuery> does anyone know a way to cache ds-panel-over
[20:29:55] <forQuery> so that way, we're not querying the dom for it?
[20:30:16] <jak2000> pastie.org
[20:30:52] <quuxman> forQuery: can you use pastebin please?
[20:31:00] <forQuery> oh cool
[20:31:04] <forQuery> hey sure :)
[20:31:13] <quuxman> forQuery: it's considered rather impolite to paste blocks of code in IRC
[20:32:11] <quuxman> How do I create an element surrounded by text nodes? like $("foo<span>bar</span>baz")
[20:32:40] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10004015
[20:32:50] <forQuery> it's pretty much,
[20:33:39] <vinex08> hi, im planning to learn on how to create a simple 'rotating/sliding/fadein-fadeout' testimonials... can you recommend a tutorial/link for beginners?
[20:33:51] <vinex08> i'm thinking the code will be the same for image sliders?
[20:33:56] <forQuery> <div class="ds-panel-over" is appended using jquery, then later referenced in later method as $(".ds-panel-over", $(ui.helper).parent()).remove();
[20:33:58] <quuxman> forQuery: why not use a local variable?
[20:34:29] <forQuery> because you have not taught me better yet :)
[20:34:43] <forQuery> for which line do you mean?   I tried to use var.  I thought that made the variable local.
[20:35:43] <forQuery> becasue, no matter whcih way I try, I have to search the dom for $('.ds-panel-over"
[20:36:06] <forQuery> but, above in previous method I .append("<div class='ds-panel-over'></div>")
[20:36:31] <forQuery> so, even if i use local variable, i still have to define local variable and query the dom for .ds-panel-over
[20:36:53] <forQuery> so im asking, when I append this div class ds-panel-over.... is there way i can call it without searching the dom
[20:37:02] <forQuery> using jquery selector for it in next method
[20:37:24] <forQuery> because, jquery must know where it is putting it, so it seems wasteful to search again, even if to create a variable.
[20:38:59] <quuxman> outside of start: var $panel = $('.ds-panel-over'); ...; $ui_helper.parent().append($panel); // how is this hard?
[20:39:02] <vinex08> anyone? :) a link will do
[20:41:03] <forQuery> but this div does not exist on the page... so here you are trying to define $panel to $('.ds-panel-over').
[20:41:13] <forQuery> i thought it was bad to search for elements that did not exist on page.
[20:41:27] <forQuery> I did not know that you could use a selector like that to append a div.
[20:42:10] <forQuery> is that a better approach?
[20:42:14] <forQuery> to do it that way, then the way it currently is
[20:42:15] <forQuery> for speed?
[20:42:18] <forQuery> for speed?
[20:45:22] <forQuery> in other words, did you mean that this is better
[20:45:23] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10004041
[20:45:36] <forQuery> and this is worse
[20:45:36] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10004015
[20:48:30] <forQuery> can anyone confirm?
[20:58:14] <scribblemaniac> forQuery: To my surprise, I can confirm this. I would've thought the second way would be faster. Here's a link for you test it for yourself: http://jsperf.com/tintotticto
[21:02:50] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10004080  are these the same?
[21:03:01] <forQuery> gosh, i would love to learn how to use jsperf, thank you for that link i will try
[21:08:01] <Max-P> forQuery, No. I'm not even sure what the second one does, but it's definitely not the same thing
[21:08:50] <Max-P> That is because $ds_panel_top is a jQuery object by itself, while the first one queries all .ds-panel-top elements in oHelper's parent element.
[21:13:33] <znf> Hi.
[21:13:39] <znf> Is there an easier way than this?
[21:13:39] <znf> $('button[data-id="*9B9AB"]').parent().parent().children().first().text("Znuffie")
[21:18:15] <Max-P> znf, Without changing the HTML, I don't think so.
[21:18:29] <znf> It's a table with different data, so I guess not
[21:18:58] <Max-P> You could use .closest() instead of the two .parent(), but that would only slow it down slightly for almost nothing in readability
[22:05:05] <vinex08> hi, im planning to learn on how to create a simple 'rotating/sliding/fadein-fadeout' testimonials... can you recommend a tutorial/link for beginners?
[22:05:07] <vinex08> i'm thinking the code will be the same for image sliders?
[22:15:29] <wa5ted> vinex08: use jsfiddle build from scratch
[23:17:00] <vinex08> ok

[23:37:35] <mwdev> can anyone give me a hand with some resize trouble shooting, http://pastebin.com/vbUevFRV been working on this all day with no success. Thanks
[23:45:16] <wa5ted> mwdev: a live demo might be better for us to debug
[23:45:31] <Cork> mwdev: binding event handlers in a resize even is a BAD idea
[23:45:39] <Cork> *event*
[23:46:23] <Cork> if the width gets below 500 you will get a ton of event mouseup handlers added to document
[23:46:39] <Cork> (one for every pixel the mouse moves)
[23:47:15] <Cork> mwdev: what you need to do is store the resize state in a variable
[23:47:26] <Cork> and in the mouseup event handler check if it is true or false
[23:47:46] <mwdev> OOO i never thought of doing that
[23:48:40] <mwdev> i kept looking up how to do resize properly without all the calls, and the responses i found were worse. i will give that a shot tho cork
[23:49:06] <Cork> mwdev: and implied also means bind the mouseup event once on page load
[23:49:12] <Cork> and leave it always active
[23:49:24] <Cork> and not inside the resize
[23:52:27] <mwdev> im alittle confused about what you mean by the mouseup handler. You mean to have it inside a document ready right? I had all the code you saw in a separte place for testing
[23:55:12] <Cork> mwdev: http://jsfiddle.net/t5yyq43a/
[23:55:29] <Cork> as you only use window and document you don't need ready
[23:57:39] <IamTrying> http://www.virtualmusicalinstruments.com/guitar - anyone know if there is jQuery of this?
