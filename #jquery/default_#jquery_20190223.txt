[14:42:49] <alinp25> const tr = $("<tr></tr>").append($("<td></td>").text(book.name)).append($("<td></td>")).text(book.author); tr.appendTo(tBody);           It won't add the <td></td> elements, it justs put the last text (book.author) inside <tr></tr> and that's it. What do I do wrong?
[14:51:43] <shoky> alinp25: your last .text() is on the <tr> , not on the <td> .  the closing paren ) is in the wrong place
[14:51:56] <alinp25> Thank you so much
[16:41:14] <znf> Can anyone recommend a form validator plugin/library for jquery that is simple to use but can do more complex things? (like validating specific fields based on the value of other fields)
