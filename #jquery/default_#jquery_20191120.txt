[01:46:51] <Rockwood> hello any active here?
[01:47:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:47:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[01:47:21] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they well :)
[01:47:25] <robertmaxrees> *will
[01:49:29] <Rockwood> i am bit  confuse in
[01:50:26] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/0p74gwrL/
[01:50:57] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:50:58] <Rockwood> $table.bootstrapTable  is for response
[01:51:00] <Rockwood> ?
[01:51:23] <robertmaxrees> $table is defined somewhere else.
[01:51:28] <Rockwood> actually i wanna use ajax for transfer data
[01:51:41] <Rockwood> i am using boostrap datatable
[01:51:57] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you skipped a few steps.
[01:52:07] <Rockwood> something like?
[01:52:30] <robertmaxrees> mind backing up and explaining the actual problem?
[01:53:44] <Rockwood> actually onclick i am call modal of boostrap and this modal having inputs for create new row
[01:54:02] <Rockwood> now my confusion point
[01:54:18] <Rockwood> how to use ajax onsubmit on modal form
[01:54:29] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:54:45] <Rockwood> getting what i mean?
[01:54:50] <robertmaxrees> well, are you familiar with how to use ajax on a normal form?
[01:54:56] <Rockwood> yes
[01:55:04] <robertmaxrees> then where's the issue?
[01:55:12] <robertmaxrees> similar concept.
[01:55:20] <Rockwood> i never used with datatables
[01:55:28] <robertmaxrees> wait
[01:55:38] <robertmaxrees> are you using datatables or bootstrap table?
[01:56:07] <Rockwood> i am using https://examples.bootstrap-table.com/
[01:56:17] <robertmaxrees> then why mention datatables?
[01:56:38] <Rockwood> they defined as datatable
[01:56:44] <robertmaxrees> link?
[02:00:13] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[02:06:29] <Rockwood> link means?
[02:06:41] <Rockwood> not getting your point abt link
[02:06:43] <robertmaxrees> who "defined as datatable"
[02:06:54] <herol3oy> hi. how can i change the Latin numbers (the timer in the middle) to Farsi/Persian? http://bit.do/p0m
[02:06:59] <Rockwood> bootstrap i think
[02:07:29] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood that doesn't make sense.  can you provide more code and links to relevant docs?
[02:07:44] <Rockwood> let me find that
[02:07:52] <Rockwood> give me few seconds
[02:08:18] <robertmaxrees> herol3oy those aren't latin numbers, those are arabic.  and you probably want some kind of internationalization setup.
[02:08:31] <robertmaxrees> herol3oy what are you using for this countdown?
[02:11:16] <robertmaxrees> lol welp.
[02:12:13] <robertmaxrees> I need to get to bed.  Rockwood your issue is likely either that you just need to read the docs for whatever your using.  If that doesn't help - check out event delegation for jquery.
[02:12:16] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[05:03:47] <anli> I am trying to reset the scale with var meta = $("meta"); meta.attr("scale", 1); but that does not do anything. Is there anyone that have done this?
[05:07:27] <Cork> scale isn't an attribute
[05:07:32] <Cork> its a css property
[05:07:44] <Cork> ah, wait on the meta element
[05:08:16] <Cork> anli: the meta tag is in the header not the body so you can't select it like that
[05:08:46] <Cork> $(document.head).find('meta') should work though
[05:08:46] <anli> I just did, jQuery finds it
[05:08:52] <Cork> but check what you find with it
[05:09:02] <anli> strange then
[05:09:14] <Cork> also never EVER change dynamic values with attr
[05:09:15] <anli> Maybe just using $("meta") is not cross browser?
[05:09:23] <anli> Why?
[05:09:30] <anli> Oh, I maybe understand why
[05:09:31] <Cork> attr uses the setAttribute metod
[05:09:38] <Cork> and not all browsers monitor those
[05:09:41] <anli> But it seems I need to do that with meta
[05:09:46] <anli> prop instead?
[05:09:49] <Cork> always
[05:10:05] <Cork> the rule of thumb is quit simple
[05:10:17] <Cork> always use prob, unless you've tried and it breaks it somehow
[05:10:32] <Cork> prob==prop
[05:10:46] <anli> :)
[05:11:17] <Cork> of the top of my head i know of two cases where attr makes sense, the rest should all be prop
[05:11:45] <Cork> (get href or src without getting it rewritten to a absolute url)
[05:11:54] <anli> Should it be var meta = $("meta[name=viewport]"); meta.prop("content", "scale=1, user-scalable=yes"); ?
[05:11:56] <Cork> and to set data- properties directly as attributes
[05:12:08] <Cork> yes
[05:12:16] <anli> It did not reset the scaling however
[05:12:23] <Cork> might be it won
[05:12:25] <Cork> *'t
[05:12:26] <anli> Also, I want to be able to restore the scaling
[05:12:32] <Cork> not sure how dynamic the meta tag is
[05:12:35] <anli> So I can get back to the zoomed in mode
[05:12:38] <anli> ok
[05:12:39] <Cork> meta tags are to emulate http headers
[05:12:44] <anli> yeah
[05:13:13] <anli> width=device-width did not take me back to normal, but panned the webpage in a strange way
[05:13:19] <Cork> also i know browser are starting to ignore the viewport meta tag too
[05:13:24] <anli> So there is some effect at least
[05:13:28] <Cork> cause too many sites abuse it
[05:14:01] <anli> It is very strange to ignore it because developers are really divided into two parts when it comes to however you should enable zoom or not
[05:14:24] <Cork> ya, and that is why browsers ignore it
[05:14:35] <Cork> cause browsers aren't for developers it is a _user agent_
[05:14:44] <Cork> it is there for its users benifit
[05:14:45] <anli> But if we have two equally large groups of devs, it will be hard to throw half of them
[05:15:15] <Cork> if enough users find it problematic to read text on enough pages, browsers will start ignoring the header
[05:15:25] <anli> It is of course a concern for the end user that makes a developer go into one of those two beliefs
[05:15:28] <Cork> and that is exactly what happens
[05:15:55] <Cork> anli: sadly to day it, but your mistaken a bit
[05:15:55] <anli> It is very strange to let browsers take responsibility for readability
[05:16:05] <anli> How am I mistaken?
[05:16:06] <Cork> what developers want isn't the primary objective
[05:16:15] <Cork> developers are only the second objective
[05:16:20] <anli> You understood me wrong
[05:16:35] <Cork> and they get what the browser allows as long as it doesn't makes it worse for users
[05:16:38] <anli> When I said developers, I meant developers caring for end users
[05:16:53] <Cork> ya, but too many developers doesn't are about users
[05:16:57] <anli> There are two ways to care for the end user, one is to enable zoom, one is to disable zoom
[05:17:05] <Cork> they are about "where logo always beeing visible"
[05:17:20] <Cork> "the designe matching pixel by pixel" to how the designer made it
[05:17:25] <Cork> and stupid things like that
[05:17:37] <Cork> and hens why they lose the power
[05:17:54] <anli> You are probably right on that
[05:18:03] <Cork> it isn't me stating it
[05:18:15] <anli> you did actually even if it was on behalf of someone else
[05:18:22] <Cork> it just following the bug trackers of chrome and firefox (only two that are open)
[05:19:05] <Cork> ya, my point is that it is the browser developers stating it
[05:19:27] <anli> For some reason, I did not find satisfactory amount of search hits when I searched for "zoom webpage programmatically"
[05:19:37] <Cork> and especially with how many sites i have to put into desktop mode on the mobile just so i can zoom them is silly...
[05:20:04] <anli> :)
[05:20:20] <Cork> anli: mainly cause the zoom is meant to be a user action, controlled by the user
[05:20:41] <Cork> but there is the zoom css property, i think it has been standardized now (they talked about it at least)
[05:20:53] <anli> must check, maybe thats all I need to use
[05:21:01] <anli> I also saw such a css property
[05:21:43] <anli> oh, its 1 for body, even if the webpage is zoomed in
[05:21:49] <anli> Maybe I need to check the html tag
[05:22:03] <anli> same
[05:22:43] <Cork> hmm seams it predates github... oh well..
[05:23:05] <Cork> anli: ie added one ages ago, then safari adapted it
[05:23:14] <Cork> but i remeber a talk about standardize it
[05:23:23] <anli> ok
[05:23:26] <Cork> but ya, predates github so...
[05:24:06] <anli> Is there a devtools panel in mobile chrome?
[05:24:11] <anli> Without remote debugging
[05:24:16] <Cork> no
[05:24:37] <anli> Thats a bit silly maybe
[05:24:43] <Cork> no mobile except old opera has one
[05:24:47] <anli> But it would be hard to fit maybe
[05:25:05] <Cork> now days i think it is mostly legacy
[05:25:12] <Cork> it used to be too expensice
[05:32:56] <anli> hm, chome://inspect/#devices is treated like a websearch now
[05:33:06] <anli> When putting it in the address field
[05:33:18] <anli> Is it the slashes?
[05:34:51] <anli> oh, I did not have devtools open
[08:43:39] <dimi1947> I am having some difficulty understanding reading this tutorial here https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:45:14] <dimi1947> the example code in the tutorial uses anchor links(as you can see foryourself) to demonstrate event delegation...
[08:47:26] <dimi1947> I cannot understand why the click handler(as shown in the example) does NOT have effect on the newly added to the DOM anchors
[08:49:15] <dimi1947> I will try to break it in pieces...when .on is called?
[08:49:56] <dimi1947> I want to try to this Q first
[08:52:48] <dimi1947> try to answer
[09:03:47] <thykka> dimi1947, an event listener can only be attached to existing elements. If you try to attach it to something that isn't yet on the page, nothing will be attached
[09:04:41] <thykka> event delegation sidesteps this by attaching to an element that is definitely on the page at all times, and the handler then checks if the actual event source matches the delegate target
[09:04:47] <dimi1947> now it is more clear to me...am I right to assume that event delegation is the workaround?
[09:05:20] <dimi1947> I wrote my comment before I saw you second one...
[09:05:25] <thykka> it's a decent workaraound yes. But because it acts on an element further up in the tree, it can end up wasting more resources than individual listeners
[09:06:27] <thykka> consider a page where you have a hundred buttons, all delegated via document.body. Now every time a click event bubbles through body, it will have to check all those 100 possible targets
[09:06:35] <dimi1947> I am having difficulty implementing it though...
[09:07:01] <dimi1947> I want to do it for a search box that gets added dynamically
[09:08:04] <dimi1947> so the event here is keyup I just do not know where to attach it though
[09:08:41] <thykka> attach it to something that contains the search box, and that exists at the time when you attach the listener (i.e. page load or such)
[09:08:54] <thykka> preferably as close to the search box as possible
[09:12:43] <dimi1947> FIXED IT...THANKS
[09:15:24] <thykka> _b
[10:51:17] <bestdesign> hi all
[10:51:22] <bestdesign> any idea why this is always true
[10:51:24] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/zormh4ck/6/?
[10:51:32] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/zormh4ck/6/
[10:52:04] <bestdesign> is contain more than a-z so i think need be false?
[11:52:39] <shoky> bestdesign: first of all you're missing a # in line 6.  and your regex is testing whether the input has consecutive a-z letters, which it does, so it's true anyway
[11:53:43] <shoky> if you want to test for ONLY consecutive a-z then it's  /^[a-z]+$/
[12:18:16] <bestdesign> shoky: thank you!
[15:37:02] <adder> how can I do something with all subsequently created elements? in this scenario I need to highlight all subsequently created code blocks https://dpaste.de/dn0i so, when you click one of the elements, another element is created using AJAX and I need to do something with that element
[15:37:27] <adder> I just locked up my computer with something like this:     $(document).bind('DOMSubtreeModified', highlightBlock);
[15:37:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because that's going to cause itself to fire lol
[15:38:27] <adder> :D
[15:38:28] <robertmaxrees> could give the new elements a class
[15:38:57] <adder> I think I can't do that, they're dynamically created
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:39:13] <adder> (it's not me who is creating them)
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> oh
[15:39:34] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle showing the problem then?
[15:41:31] <adder> hardly, I'm creating a site using Django, and I'm using a plugin called martor as markdown editor. don't know what more info could I provide
[15:42:04] <robertmaxrees> a small test-case doesn't mean i need your entire stack :) just the bare essentials to understand what you're using, etc.
[15:42:18] <robertmaxrees> what's generating these new elements?
[15:43:51] <adder> so my app looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/skJHnFu.png when you click on a note, it is displayed in the rightmost area. so when you click a note, an ajax request is fired which calls a django view that renders that part of the page (https://dpaste.de/Je0x)
[15:44:09] <adder> I'm happy to provide as much info as you need, it's just I don't know where would I even start
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> that's how you add your class then :)
[15:44:48] <robertmaxrees> var $response = $(response);  $response.addClass('foo');
[15:46:04] <adder> this is what gets rendered: https://dpaste.de/5jOV
[15:46:15] <adder> do you think I could utilise martor-preview class?
[15:46:29] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> also: is there not a wrapping node around that entire fragment?
[15:47:55] <adder> so what I just showed you goes into .note-container
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> you're likely going to need to remove this calss.
[15:48:31] <robertmaxrees> *class.
[15:48:46] <adder> which one
[15:48:56] <robertmaxrees> since you're going to use it to identify these new elements for the highlighter, and then remove it after you call it.
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> the one i'm saying you should add.
[15:49:30] <adder> hm, wait, so I shouldn't be adding any class after all, am I getting you right?
[15:49:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying the exact opposite - you SHOULD add a class.
[15:50:35] <adder> alright, let's try. what element should be classed?
[15:50:58] <robertmaxrees> what does the rendered html look like for one of these fragments coming from the server?
[15:51:40] <adder> you mean this part of the page, the rightmost area? https://dpaste.de/5jOV
[15:52:01] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[15:52:11] <robertmaxrees> i mean the response from the server.
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> literally what I just said.
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> the idea is that you add a class to the root node of the fragment coming from your server.
[15:53:57] <adder> so this is the response https://dpaste.de/iRND
[15:54:04] <adder> sorry I'm a complete noob
[15:54:54] <adder> so are you saying I should wrap this in a div and add a class to it? https://dpaste.de/5jOV
[15:55:00] <robertmaxrees> stop - one sec.
[15:55:03] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[15:55:40] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/67QHC
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea of what you want to do.
[15:56:10] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea if this code will actually function, but it shows where I'm pointing you towards.
[15:57:02] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[16:00:25] <adder> yeah I'll try something with that, I'll see what I can do
[16:00:28] <adder> thanks
[16:42:38] <adder> robertmaxrees: what do you think of just highlighting the code block in success handler? it works, no idea how good a solution it is https://dpaste.de/C8RO
[16:42:50] <robertmaxrees> that works, too.
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> though that's heavy-handed.
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> $('.note-container pre').each(function(i, block) { will re-run it on all of them, not just the new one.
[16:43:36] <robertmaxrees> which is why i keep suggesting adding/removing a class.
[16:43:52] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you willing to do that?
[16:44:30] <adder> it's not that I'm not, it's just that I don't fully understand how am I supposed to do that, I'll keep looking at your snippet
[16:44:43] <robertmaxrees> then say that instead of going back and forth :)
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> see how I do var $response = $(response); and then $response.addClass('newNote'); ?
[16:45:19] <adder> "will re-run it on all of them, not just the new one." aren't all of them new?
[16:45:23] <adder> yes
[16:45:31] <robertmaxrees> lmao i give up.
[16:45:42] <robertmaxrees> i need to see your markup before i can keep going.
[16:45:51] <robertmaxrees> the requirements and descriptions keep magically changing.
[16:46:15] <adder> ok what should I show you
[16:46:33] <robertmaxrees> the relevant pieces of rendered HTML.
[16:47:28] <robertmaxrees> ideally i'd have an isolated test case.
[16:48:00] <adder> so this (https://dpaste.de/5jOV) goes into .note-container and when combined looks like this (https://dpaste.de/iRND) (I've already showed you this)
[16:48:08] <robertmaxrees> rendered html.
[16:48:12] <robertmaxrees> not the server-side template
[16:48:25] <robertmaxrees> but what's actually getting sent to the browser.
[16:49:03] <adder> so this? https://dpaste.de/iRND
[16:49:07] <robertmaxrees> so the second link is the container, and each .martor-preview is another "snippet"?
[16:49:27] <robertmaxrees> and the martor-preview is what you're getting back from the server, right?
[16:50:05] <adder> I'm getting back from the server everything inside .note-container
[16:51:17] <robertmaxrees> so this: https://bpaste.net/show/GVXXE ?
[16:51:26] <adder> yeah
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> okay - first issue, you'll want to wrap that entire thing in a div within your template.
[16:52:54] <robertmaxrees> so you have something like this: https://bpaste.net/show/37W3A
[16:53:12] <adder> ok
[16:54:08] <robertmaxrees> now you have more semantic markup - each note has a wrapping div that separates it from the others in a much cleaner way.
[16:54:49] <adder> ok, but only one note goes into .note-container
[16:55:14] <ckb> whats my best resource for getting help with daterangepicker?
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> adder i can't help you at this point.
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> you keep revealing new details every time I get somewhere.
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> make a test case and we can go from there.,
[16:56:09] <ckb> aka I want a date to be a submit button
[16:56:21] <adder> sorry but you obviously don't understand what I'm talking about, it might be that I'm not explaining it well, sorry once again
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> adder you're not giving me enough info :shrug:
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> ckb you mean https://www.daterangepicker.com/ ?
[16:56:56] <ckb> Yes robert
[16:57:21] <ckb> their docs don’t really give me a lot of info and I can’t find a callback function when a date is picked
[16:57:56] <robertmaxrees> ckb you might need to manually implement that.
[16:58:17] <ckb> just turn each cell into a .click() to submit the parent form?
[16:58:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd do a single delegated handler on to the parent
[16:58:48] <ckb> ahhh good call
[16:58:50] <ckb> thanks!
[16:59:16] <ckb> one other question…. the calendar hides when I rightclick -> inspector
[16:59:24] <ckb> what’s the best way to handle it?
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> you don't?
[16:59:41] <adder> so there's .notes-container where all the notes are, and .note-container on the right for displaying clicked note
[16:59:42] <robertmaxrees> g2g, meeting
[16:59:50] <ckb> well.. to be able to see the markup I mean
[17:00:14] <ckb> (I can’t right click on the calendar to inspect it)
[17:03:10] <ckb> agh! it’s not a child of the parent form. :(
[17:03:17] <robertmaxrees> ckb wut
[17:03:30] <ckb> it appends it to <body>
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> ckb then do it to the body? :)
[17:03:44] <ckb> so I have no idea what form it’s apart of!
[17:03:55] <robertmaxrees> there's more than one?
[17:04:09] <ckb> not right now! but if there was?
[17:04:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:04:35] <ckb> I mean I can hack around it, no doubt
[17:04:54] <ckb> I guess I just need to contact their support…
[17:05:27] <ckb> was just hoping it was like an absolute positioned element within the form.
[19:08:51] <ckb> someone plz help me through https://www.daterangepicker.com/ … I’m going mad
[19:09:03] <robertmaxrees> make a test case :)
[19:09:41] <ckb> robert…. can you skim those doc’s and see if there’s a click callback? should I use another lib?
[19:09:49] <robertmaxrees> i didn't find one.
[19:09:52] <robertmaxrees> earlier when i looked.
[19:10:15] <ckb> is there another lib I should use?
[19:10:31] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea since i don't know what you're building./
[19:10:42] <ckb> do I just code this myself?
[19:11:05] <robertmaxrees> again, i have no way to know what the right solution should be since i don't know what your use case is.
[19:11:14] <ckb> I need an input field + icon + icon2 and icon 2 being a submit button on click
[19:11:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[19:11:36] <robertmaxrees> not "how are you planning on building what you want?"
[19:11:41] <robertmaxrees> like, what's the actual thing for.
[19:11:48] <ckb> Call logs…. by partial # and date
[19:12:03] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what's the interaction you're hoping for with this widget?
[19:12:13] <ckb> I need a caldendar that will submit the form (q + date) on click
[19:12:38] <robertmaxrees> this has the concept of an "apply"
[19:12:45] <robertmaxrees> so you should probably just use that.
[19:13:21] <robertmaxrees> brb
[19:13:48] <ckb> type in “1111” in the search (q) box, and enter… (works as intended)… 100 logs later your need a date, click on calendar icon (brings up month to date; works). click on date…. >>> all me
[19:14:07] <ckb> clicks on date, submit ****
[19:14:30] <robertmaxrees> back
[19:35:05] <ckb> it’s funny how there’s no click callback for this
[19:35:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[19:35:24] <robertmaxrees> they're just using .on() to bind listeners.
[19:35:30] <ckb> ‘
[19:35:31] <robertmaxrees> so you could do that yourself.
[19:35:56] <ckb> so if I use .on() I have to grab m d y myself?
[19:36:19] <ckb> rather than a callback?
[19:36:25] <ckb> seems legit
[19:36:34] <robertmaxrees> they have examples on that page that show you how to do that.
[19:37:08] <ckb> to submit on click?
[19:37:17] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[19:37:22] <robertmaxrees> no - shows you how to get the dates.
[19:37:45] <ckb> my problem isn’t getting dates. I want to submit on click of a date
[19:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you can do that by binding your own click handler.
[19:39:33] <robertmaxrees> or just do it the way they suggest and do it on apply.
[19:40:30] <robertmaxrees> or use a different plugin entirely :)
[23:36:25] <adder`> anyone using https://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Bootstrap-4-Tag-Input-Plugin-jQuery.html? I'm having an issue with my tags that contain spaces being surrounded by quotes
[23:36:55] <adder`> I'm using django-taggit on the backend and I have tried to print the tag, no quotes inside, so I'm thinking the issue must be with the jquery plugin
[23:38:24] <adder`> so when I'm adding tags that contain spaces, they're added as they should (no quotes), however when I come back later to them (say, in UpdateView), the quotes are displayed.
