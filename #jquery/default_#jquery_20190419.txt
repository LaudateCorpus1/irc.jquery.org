[04:10:35] <puchacz> hi, is it easy to add dir="auto" somewhere to autocomplete dropdown so it can align both RTL and LTR text correctly please?
[04:10:52] <puchacz> modifying jquery source is OK if it is needed
[04:11:56] <puchacz> jquery-ui source I mean
[05:49:48] <puchacz> has anybody used jquery-ui with RTL languages, like Arabic pls?
