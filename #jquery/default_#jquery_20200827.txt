[01:01:48] <jnewt> having trouble with .on('blur' event in a plugin I'm working on.  it works if another .on('click' handler i've defined is fired, but if i click just click somewhere else, it doesn't fire.
[01:02:08] <robertmaxrees> mind showing the code?
[01:06:42] <robertmaxrees> jnewt
[01:07:29] <jnewt> working on getting somethign small pasted.   seems it's not firing at all...i dont' really understand blur i guess.
[01:08:08] <robertmaxrees> Just paste the JS.
[01:08:12] <robertmaxrees> usually pretty obvious :)
[01:14:41] <robertmaxrees> jnewt
[01:15:41] <jnewt> i can't figure out how to get jsfiddle or jsbin to give me a link like pastebin..
[01:16:07] <robertmaxrees> press "save" and then copy the URL out of the browser.
[01:16:43] <sydbarret> robert can i change the input element with jquery?
[01:16:59] <sydbarret> so transform a select option to a true or false or input text
[01:17:18] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret 2 things: 1 - ask the channel.  2 - you can do anything, but that sounds... weird lol
[01:17:35] <robertmaxrees> need more info.
[01:18:09] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, https://jsbin.com/cexayaziqo/1/edit?html,js,output
[01:19:28] <robertmaxrees> jnewt huh?
[01:19:58] <robertmaxrees> jnewt looks like you have elements you're dynamically creating that you're trying to bind listeners to.,
[01:20:13] <jnewt> that is correct
[01:20:26] <robertmaxrees> jnewt that's your issue.  you want delegated listeners instead,
[01:20:42] <jnewt> the on('click' works fine.  the on('blur' doesn't fire
[01:20:51] <robertmaxrees> jnewt check out https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[01:22:18] <robertmaxrees> but also, blur fires for form inputs.
[01:23:36] <robertmaxrees> https://javascript.info/focus-blur
[01:23:51] <robertmaxrees> not all elements fire all events jnewt
[01:27:19] <jnewt> so even if i used the delegated listeners (which I don't understand yet), it wouldn't work because it's not a form element?
[01:27:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[01:27:58] <robertmaxrees> why would you care if a div "lost focus"?
[01:30:55] <robertmaxrees> jnewt mind describing the problem you're trying to solve?
[01:31:11] <Cork> might be "any input inside it lost focus"?
[01:31:16] <Cork> but ya, that does look strange
[01:31:35] <jnewt> i'm trying to hide it if you click outside of it.  but i'm moving working code from just in a <script> tag on the html to a plugin so i can reuse it.   i used $(document).on('click',function(){$(".dd").hide();}); previously, but that doesn't seem like something that would be in a plugin or even work.
[01:31:53] <robertmaxrees> "hide it" - is it a modal or something?
[01:32:27] <Cork> that is exactly what .one is for
[01:33:01] <robertmaxrees> or just .on() with a quick internal check with a .closest() to check if you clicked inside the modal :)
[01:33:25] <Cork> yup, and scoping makes it easy to clean that up too
[01:33:42] <Cork> $(document).on('click.<plugin-name>')
[01:33:54] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[01:33:58] <robertmaxrees> jnewt
[01:34:36] <Cork> and for the cleaning up $(document).off('.<plugin-name>')
[01:35:01] <robertmaxrees> sure, though depending, the memory savings may not necessarily be worth it :)
[01:36:37] <Cork> memory savings?
[01:36:39] <jnewt> just took a look through .one, that doesn't look at all like what i'm trying to do.
[01:36:50] <robertmaxrees> jnewt are you dealing with a modal?
[01:37:03] <Cork> you mean from removing the event handler, it is more for performance then anything else
[01:37:39] <robertmaxrees> Cork basically.  in a lot of cases you don't really need to worry about juggling handlers imho.
[01:38:24] <Cork> robertmaxrees: a plugin should ALWAYS clean up after it self, especially if it is handlers outside the element tree it "should work in"
[01:38:37] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, maybe, it's just a div full of checkboxes that i show / hide based on a button.  seems to fit the description of a modal as it goes over other elements, but no so because it doesn't disable the rest of the page
[01:39:25] <robertmaxrees> Cork fair point.  i'm so used to dealing with just my site and less about building plugins :)
[01:39:42] <robertmaxrees> jnewt so maybe a tooltip of sorts?
[01:39:58] <robertmaxrees> because if so, a similar concept applies - Cork's got the right idea./
[01:41:38] <jnewt> with the .one?
[01:41:59] <Cork> jnewt: scoped event handers
[01:42:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:43:01] <Cork> $(document).on('click.my-plugin-form-handlers',function() { /* code */ }); later: $(document).off('.my-plugin-form-handlers') /* remove all event handlers the plugin added to document */
[01:43:44] <Cork> just make sure .my-plugin-form-habndlers is a string nothing else on the site uses, as it isn't a variable but a scope name
[01:44:07] <robertmaxrees> also: blur may not be what you want in this case still.  can you share more context around what you're building?
[01:44:22] <Cork> ya, it is most likely not blur
[01:50:31] <jnewt> it's menus in a table header for filtering / sorting.
[01:51:44] <robertmaxrees> and you want the menu to go away when you click outside of it?
[01:51:54] <jnewt> yes
[01:52:07] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, like a tooltip or a modal :)
[01:52:39] <robertmaxrees> You want a handler on document (delegated or otherwise) that checks if the click happened inside the menu or not and, if not, close it.
[01:52:40] <jnewt> one of those, or a dropdown, or idk what to call it...don't label me!
[01:54:04] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, and that's what i was trying to say i have, but i'm moving to a plugin from just code in my html file and i don't know how to do that in a plugin.  if the plugin has a $(document).on('click' and the plugin has the same, do they just both fire?
[01:57:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?  which do you want to use?
[01:57:35] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you have two separate click event handlers?
[01:57:46] <robertmaxrees> anyway, gotta go.  Sorry duder.
[01:59:20] <jnewt> maybe.  what if i apply this plugin to multiple tables on the same page.  there is a click handler for each column in each table.  could be a lot of them.
[02:03:04] <jnewt> say we start here: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/nz6hpstk/  which is two working modals.  i want to, within the plugin, close the modal if i click outside of it.
[02:03:38] <Cork> jnewt: you want something like this https://jsfiddle.net/y08req15/
[02:05:52] <jnewt> Cork: YES!!!  thank you, i have to now try to understand this witchcraft.
[02:08:33] <Cork> hmm the scope name was possibly not the smartest...
[02:08:56] <Cork> jnewt: https://jsfiddle.net/y08req15/1/
[02:09:18] <Cork> just a small change to make it cleaer that the handle scope name has nothing to do with the "menu" class name
[02:10:37] <jnewt> what is up with the setTimeout, with no timeout time?
[02:11:04] <Cork> jnewt: it is there to make the browser unspool the event queue for the current click event
[02:11:16] <Cork> so the new handler doesn't catch the click event setting it up :)
[02:11:18] <jnewt> woosh
[02:11:54] <Cork> it has no time cause it asks the browser to do it as soon as the next event time exists
[02:12:17] <Cork> (or rather the next event loop tick exists)
[02:12:46] <jnewt> javascript is the strangest language i ever use.   everything i need to do, there's some weird way of using something to do something that you just have to know what it does behind the scenes, it's like always using side effects to accomplish whatever you are really trying to do.
[02:13:53] <Cork> jnewt: mostly cause backwards compatibility is more important in javascript then in most other language
[02:14:03] <Cork> cause you can't "fix the weird code"
[02:14:19] <Cork> so when a hack gets to become commonly used it stays
[02:14:39] <Cork> instead of getting a new cleaner function added like most other languages does
[02:14:52] <Cork> (and then depricate the old solution)
[02:15:11] <jnewt> but it does that too, like with .on vs .live
[02:15:23] <Cork> thats in jquery not javascript
[02:15:37] <Cork> javascript is implemented in the browser, jquery is a lib the site loads
[02:15:58] <Cork> while the site can switch the lib and then adjust the code it uses to use it
[02:16:10] <Cork> javascript has no syncronisation with the code modification
[02:16:58] <Cork> the user upgrades the browser and visits an old site, the script from the site still has to work, and the user can't modify it if it starts to error out
[02:17:32] <Cork> there are VERY fiew languages that has that problem
[02:17:57] <Cork> asm is on of the view i can think of out of the top of my head
[02:18:46] <Cork> actually scratch that, the user can modify asm just like any other language
[02:19:40] <jnewt> i know some asm, at least the asm that goes on microcontrollers.  it so simple / straightforward, there's not a lot to deal with usually, it's just drudgery
[02:19:56] <Cork> ya
[02:20:32] <Cork> javascript can be a bit confusing, mainly cause it is working quite differently to most other oo languages
[02:21:05] <Cork> though ecmascript 7 gives an alternative declaration form that gives an alternative for taht
[02:21:08] <Cork> *that
[02:22:26] <jnewt> i tried node.js once (had to build a server app that printed labels)...that did not go well.  i remember nesting and nesting and nesting being a thing.   chose something else, couldn't get my head around it.
[02:23:08] <Cork> ya, i never understood the pull for running js as the server...
[02:23:29] <Cork> just like i wouldn't want to write a dom modification script in c...
[02:23:47] <jnewt> it has a big base, but am glad we went a different direction there.
[02:24:22] <Cork> we're going more and more go here, and that is one of the best desisions i've ever made (for servers)
[02:24:28] <jnewt> I write a lot of c on microcontrollers.   that one i understand.
[02:24:47] <Cork> ya, sure i didn't say anything about the language, just that it has its places
[02:25:13] <Cork> and when you try to go one trick pony and use it every where it starts to cost a lot
[02:25:35] <jnewt> Cork, didn't want to name drop, but that label project started my go journey.   now i've got bits of go all over this place.  scripts, services, it seems to fit easily in a lot of places.
[02:26:13] <Cork> ya, go is VERY nice for writing super efficient one task servers
[02:27:50] <Cork> heck there are some quite impressive new services written in go (a postgres like sql server and a webserver similar to nginx)
[02:27:54] <Cork> just to name a few
[02:28:06] <jnewt> what's the webserver one?
[02:28:15] <Cork> caddy
[02:28:37] <Cork> https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy
[02:29:19] <jnewt> cool...i do like my nginx though
[02:29:27] <Cork> "Automatic HTTPS by default" is REALLY nice, just start it on a public ip and it will issue a cert without you having to do anything
[02:30:27] <Cork> and the config files is actually readable and not pages on pages long just to setup a simple site
[02:32:57] <jnewt> what's this stuff about it handling ssl certs?  that's a trip to namecheap.com for me and some transactional stuff, emails, etc.  how much can it actually do?
[02:33:51] <jnewt> like it know how to renew your certs, download and place them in the correct places and update references, etc?
[02:34:05] <Cork> jnewt: it uses lets encrypt so when the server starts it servers a site-name.invalid certificate that lets encrypts query to make sure the domain is pointing to said server
[02:34:18] <Cork> and if the challange succeededs gives out a cert
[02:34:21] <Cork> that caddy then uses
[02:35:26] <Cork> so a Caddyfile containsing "example.com" is all you need to get port 80 and 443 working (if example.com points to said server)
[02:35:26] <jnewt> i might have to play with that a bit.
[02:36:22] <Cork> jnewt: might want to read a bit more about it here https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/https
[11:27:37] <audiobirb>  i'm using jquery.datatables. I am trying to destroy and reinitialize a datatable on a dynamically generated html table. It gets about halfway there and then i get the error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined. a quick google search says the error means datatables is not able to find data in response to the ajax request. the only problem is, i don't want to make an ajax request. what's going wrong?
[11:47:46] <audiobirb> can anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63619599/jquery-datatables-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-length-of-undefin
[16:15:08] <DB_rando> Hey guys. When I console log a clicked element with console.log(this) I get a nice list of stuff that I need IE "n{_targetElement: body.clicked-div... } variable_1: 0 variable_2: 1 et cetera. How do I console_log just variable_1 in this scenario?
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> this.variable_1 ?
[16:18:04] <DB_rando> Thanks fam
[16:18:06] <DB_rando> That worked
