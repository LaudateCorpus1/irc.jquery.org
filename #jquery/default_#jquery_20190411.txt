[05:05:45] <Rob_Jones> is there a way with jquery that if a input file is added then the second input file must match the extension of the first one
[05:06:30] <Cork> Rob_Jones: not built in, but you can bind an event for when a file is selected / dropped and validate it your self
[05:06:56] <Rob_Jones> whats the selector for when a file is dropped
[05:07:12] <Rob_Jones> .change?
[05:09:30] <Cork> .on('drop')
[05:09:36] <Cork> but you need a bit more then that
[05:24:15] <Rob_Jones> with jquery if i have $('.test1-test') and $('.test2-test')
[05:24:21] <Rob_Jones> can i wildcard them somehow
[05:24:52] <Cork> no
[05:25:07] <Cork> if you need so do that it means you should split your classes
[05:25:22] <Cork> do ex. $('.test.test1') and $('.test.test2')
[05:25:27] <Cork> *to ex.*
[05:25:39] <Cork> then you can just do $('.test') and catch both
[05:26:26] <Rob_Jones> ok
[07:11:56] <Xatenev> hello
[07:12:04] <Xatenev> can i somehow prevent .on('scroll') from executing on page load?
[07:13:09] <Xatenev> context is my header looks diffeerently when scrolled down(smaller) or when on top of page (bigger)
[07:13:41] <Xatenev> but i dont want to execute the header goes smaller animation on page load when scroll position is cached by browser
[07:24:34] <Cork> Xatenev: don't bind it before on('load')
[07:26:17] <Xatenev> Cork, oh that makes sense!
[07:26:21] <Xatenev> Cork, ill try it out in a second, thank you
[08:14:51] <Xatenev> Cork, worked, thank you1
[10:41:30] <jfoster> I'm trying to select the first checkbox on my page and monitor for changes. I'm able to get at it using $(document).find("input:checkbox:first"), but when I try using an on.('change') it fails: https://jsbin.com/zirepideva/edit?html,js,output. How come?
[10:57:19] <Cork> jfoster: you put javascript in your selector
[10:57:36] <Cork> try "just" the selector instead :)
[10:58:24] <jfoster> Cork where the js was the find() ?
[10:58:59] <Cork> jfoster: .on(event, selector, function) selector you've put a string with javascript in
[10:59:41] <Cork> so just give it the selector you use there and it should work fine
[11:00:32] <jfoster> Cork Okay. I am a bit dimwitted in my use of jquery, where I use it heavily but am not familiar with the fundamentals.
[11:00:55] <jfoster> Normally I'd think $(document).find("input:checkbox:first") is a valid selector, is that not the case?
[11:01:17] <Cork> that is a selection, not a selector
[11:01:32] <jfoster> where input:checkbox:first is a selector ?
[11:01:39] <Cork> you look for the elements matching the selector and get a selection with those elements
[11:01:43] <Cork> yes
[11:01:46] <Cork> jfoster: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:02:05] <z1haze> hey guys, anyone who uses https://jqueryvalidation.org plugin I am trying to figure out how to take advantage of the require_from_group but I need to modify it so its like this: I have 3 fields in total, I either need to require the first 2 of them, OR the third one.. doesnt seem like that functionality is baked into this method by default. looking for advice
[11:02:08] <jfoster> i see, would it need to be wrapped to be a jquery selector, i.e. $('input:checkbox:first')
[11:02:27] <Cork> that is just the shortform of the .find() you used before
[11:02:34] <Cork> those two are identical
[11:02:48] <jfoster> whoa
[11:03:09] <jfoster> I think, perhaps i'm thrown off because I'm using the :first, but this makes sense if it were some other element by .class
[11:03:18] <jfoster> or #id
[11:03:38] <jfoster> ty
[11:15:44] <makr8100> jfoster: another thing you can try is the js console in your browser.  Just entering $('input:checkbox:first') will output what returns into the console output
[11:18:10] <makr8100> You would use selectors as you would in CSS.  Try $('input:checkbox:first-of-type')
[11:44:21] <thykka> I wouldn't use :checkbox as it's non-standard and these days we can simply use [type="checkbox"]
[11:44:54] <thykka> [type="checkbox"] should perform better too
[12:01:49] <makr8100> +1 for [type=checkbox]
[13:39:53] <Taplar> thykka makr8100 :checkbox is transformed into [type="checkbox"] by sizzle
[13:40:01] <Taplar> not much difference
[13:40:15] <Taplar> it's just shorthand
[13:59:59] <NitroLiq> Hi All, anyone here worked with materialize? Trying to validate a 'chips' form input and I'm having issues with their methods.
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> isn't that a css lib?
[14:00:52] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.  already cross-posted in ##javascript :)
[14:01:30] <NitroLiq> It is but uses jquery as a dependency for things certain things (accordions, etc)
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> show us the code then?
[14:02:01] <NitroLiq> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MRmNag
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?
[14:02:28] <NitroLiq> writing it now
[14:02:32] <robertmaxrees> also: if ($('.chip')) {
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> this will always be true :)
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> even if there's nothing with that ID.
[14:04:45] <NitroLiq> basic pen with no validation. What happens is, you type in the field and press enter to create a 'chip'. Works as intended. After each tag is entered, the form resets to false so basically, my required msg goes away while typing but comes back after you enter a tag.
[14:05:18] <NitroLiq> All of the scripts in there are my attempting different things
[14:05:36] <NitroLiq> I can't even get a console log using their built in method
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> could you reformulate your question?
[14:05:51] <robertmaxrees> like - "i'm expecting x, but instead i'm getting y"
[14:06:33] <NitroLiq> Sure, the gist of it is, I want my validation message to go away if a chip exists and only show if the input is completely empty
[14:06:48] <NitroLiq> console log would be fine in the pen example
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> but instead, the validation displays even if there are "chips"?
[14:07:06] <robertmaxrees> link to docs?
[14:07:20] <NitroLiq> yes, after you press enter to crete a chip
[14:07:32] <NitroLiq> https://materializecss.com/chips.html
[14:07:52] <NitroLiq> I've been on SO for the past hour trying to sort this out
[14:08:16] <NitroLiq> let me add the validation to the example...brb
[14:08:20] <robertmaxrees> wait stop
[14:08:23] <robertmaxrees> i see your issue.
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use the js init.
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> you want the methods.
[14:08:45] <robertmaxrees> https://materializecss.com/chips.html#methods
[14:09:18] <NitroLiq> The first one has the onChipAdd method.
[14:09:39] <robertmaxrees> did you read the docs?
[14:09:47] <robertmaxrees> because $('.chips').chips({ is trying to init a chips
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[14:10:05] <NitroLiq> SOme of that stuff isn't in their docsâ€”they aren't as consistent as they should be. They're SO answers
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the plugin instance and then call them from there.
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> var instance = M.Chips.getInstance(elem);
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> then use the methods from there.
[14:10:19] <robertmaxrees> per the docs.
[14:10:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:11:02] <NitroLiq> Yeah, the M namespace throws an error so I've been using another way
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> $('.chips').chips('methodName');
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> you try this?
[14:11:17] <NitroLiq> Their other components follow the same suit
[14:13:16] <robertmaxrees> M exists on that pen.
[14:13:45] <NitroLiq> I know. It's not working with npm for some reason that I haven't sussed out
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> then let's fix that problem?
[14:13:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:12] <robertmaxrees> are you bundling these using something like webpack?
[14:16:10] <NitroLiq> It's a gulp setup
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> are you using webpack?
[14:16:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:16:32] <NitroLiq> yes
[14:16:47] <robertmaxrees> okay - are you properly requiring the materialize js on the pages?
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> and in the files you're trying to use it in?
[14:16:56] <NitroLiq> I have things split into a minified vendor.js
[14:17:14] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like really you have a webpack issue here.
[14:17:15] <NitroLiq> yes. jquery, then materialize
[14:17:23] <NitroLiq> it's gulp not webpack
[14:17:33] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[14:17:49] <robertmaxrees> if you can't access the M object, you're gonna have issues doing what you want.
[14:19:21] <NitroLiq> Like I mentioned they allow both jquery that doesn't require it and vanilla that uses it. Their documentation has holes in it. It looks really together but trust me on this. I've been down the SO rabbit hole on several of their trickier inputs.
[14:19:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:19:37] <NitroLiq> for example, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41717774/materializecss-on-chip-delete
[14:19:38] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[14:19:56] <NitroLiq> that uses the code you brought up earlier.
[15:04:13] <Flyste> I have a script that uses var s = $('html').scrollTop($('#position01').offset().top -100) || $('body').scrollTop($('#position01').offset().top -100);
[15:04:35] <Flyste> It works in every browser but Safari and I can't figure out why
[15:04:53] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[15:04:57] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the ||?
[15:05:07] <robertmaxrees> why not just $('html, body') and skip the or?
[15:05:29] <robertmaxrees> (the or isn't going to do anything there since both of those are truthy, so it'll never hit the second one.
[15:05:38] <Flyste> I did that orginally but it didn't work in Safari so this was my attempt at a solution
[15:05:56] <Flyste> Apparenltly in safari html always returns 0
[15:06:44] <Flyste> When clicking on the link that triggers that code nothing happens (I don't have safari but my guy I'm working with is relaying the information)
[15:07:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:08:00] <robertmaxrees> show me a fiddle.
[15:08:10] <Flyste> I'll just show you a page
[15:08:14] <Flyste> http://test.coachesicecream.com/
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:08:17] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle is better.
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> isolated test cases :)
[15:08:47] <robertmaxrees> also: i don't have safari soooo
[15:09:02] <robertmaxrees> seeing just the small relevant bits would make this much, much easier.
[15:09:42] <Flyste> I could put one together, but like I said, it works in every other browser
[15:10:20] <robertmaxrees> right so the reason i'm asking for a fiddle is so i can see an isolated version of the problematic code.
[15:10:27] <robertmaxrees> that way i don't have to go digging.
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> but :shrug: fair enough.
[15:11:33] <Flyste> https://jsfiddle.net/xhc0e9su/
[15:12:48] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is what, exactly?  that the page doesn't scroll at all?
[15:13:01] <Flyste> Yes, clicking does nothing
[15:13:29] <robertmaxrees> just to ask the obvious, you validated that the handler is actually running, right?
[15:13:39] <robertmaxrees> via a console.log or something.
[15:14:05] <Flyste> Like I say, it works fine on any browser I use, I don't have that detailed info from Safari though
[15:14:14] <robertmaxrees> so that would be a great place to start.
[15:14:26] <robertmaxrees> but also - .scrollTop when used as a setter returns a jquery object.
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> so that or will never get hit.
[15:14:48] <robertmaxrees> hence my suggestion to go back to $('html, body')
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> but i would also validate that the handler is actually running in the first place
[15:15:12] <Flyste> I can out a alert('test'); in there to see if the guy using it sees it
[15:15:16] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:18:24] <Flyste> I'll be back, got to wait for an e-mail response.
[15:18:29] <Flyste> Thanks for the help
[15:18:30] <robertmaxrees> make sure they also clear cache.
[15:18:39] <Flyste> Did that..
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> safari is notorious for being really aggressive.
[15:26:50] <Taplar> mmmm, yeah
[16:09:52] <luist> how can i compare this value? it seems .val() doesnâ€™t return a boolean in this case:    if ($(â€˜#is_availableâ€™).val() === true) {
[16:10:08] <robertmaxrees> what is is_available?
[16:11:34] <robertmaxrees> because - fun fact - .val() only returns arrays, strings, or numbers.  if you want to get a boolean, use .prop('checked')
[16:14:14] <luist> robertmaxrees: is a input hidden with true or nothing
[16:14:26] <luist> basically will get true or undefined
[16:14:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:14:38] <robertmaxrees> so is it a checkbox?
[16:14:41] <robertmaxrees> text?
[16:14:52] <robertmaxrees> type="hidden"?  make a fiddle so we can see! :D
[16:17:35] <Taplar> $('#is_available').val() === 'true'
[16:22:32] <luist> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/5d7s2jxo/1/
[16:22:55] <Taplar> yeah, use quotes
[16:23:02] <Taplar> === ignores type coersion
[16:23:20] <Taplar> and string === boolean is never true
[16:32:30] <sponge337> Hello, lets assume a website does something by hitting key "enter". Is it possible to append another function to the event handler to do something else, as well? (like an AddEventListener in js?)
[16:32:48] <Taplar> sure, you can add any number of event listeners
[16:34:27] <sponge337> Taplar: Should I use .bind() or .on() ?
[16:34:40] <Taplar> on() or the native addEventListener
[16:35:58] <sponge337> Taplar: ok thanks
[17:22:39] <sponge337> Hi again. Is there a way to get notified, when elements children were modified? Somethink like element.childrenChanged() ? :D
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> why would you want that??
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> i ask because it's a PITA and generally you don't want to do things like that.
[17:26:56] <sponge337> what is a PITA? I was thinking of this use-case: User can interact with website in different ways: Mouse clicks, Keyboard keys... I guess its not a good practice to listen to all inputs? I was thinking of listening to the "outputs", listening to the changes of the website?
[17:27:03] <robertmaxrees> "pain in the ass"
[17:27:15] <robertmaxrees> and you want to listen to inputs and then act on them.
[17:27:33] <robertmaxrees> since that's how you generate your outputs.
[17:28:52] <sponge337> robertmaxrees: makes sense
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> you also don't listen to "all inputs" - you listen to the particular inputs that matter to you.
[17:31:10] <robertmaxrees> in the places that it matters.
[17:32:27] <sponge337> robertmaxrees: ok, thanks for the advise!
