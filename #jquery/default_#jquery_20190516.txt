[02:49:12] <thykka> RandomSerb, what do you mean? rows don't have a value property, nor does any of their contents
[02:52:18] <thykka> RandomSerb, this searches all <a> tags within <table> and returns the rows that have a link, that's text contains a "5": https://jsfiddle.net/Lsoyqkx7/
[12:47:51] <R13ose> Hi
[12:48:02] <taplar> hola
[12:51:24] <robertmaxrees> getting more and more tempted to put http://www.nohello.com/ in the subject every day lol
[12:51:47] <taplar> not sure people pay attention to the subject
[12:51:49] <R13ose> Code: https://jsfiddle.net/1rL05mfq/1/ the issue is that mdata is coming out as email: "test@test.com" and not an object array item where I get name and value.  How do I fix this in testing function?
[12:52:22] <robertmaxrees> R13ose there's over 200 lines of js in there.  what, exactly, are you referring to?
[12:53:09] <R13ose> mdata on line 42 and the function testing.
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> you realize mdata is running once on pageload, right?
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> oh i see wha3t you're referring to.  sorry - this is a really cluttered test case.
[12:55:43] <R13ose> right I know that but putting this outside of the modal function, I thought would allow the var to be stored for use elsewhere.
[12:56:05] <taplar> the result from serializeArray is not a live variable
[12:56:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> why not do the serialize inside that click handler?
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> also: $('form').submit(testing(mdata)); isn't doing what you think it's doing.
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> R13ose also: it's kind of rude to ask the same question in multiple channels.
[12:57:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:57:27] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: they told me to move here.
[12:57:57] <robertmaxrees> alright
[12:58:16] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: inside which click handler?
[12:58:55] <robertmaxrees> any of them.
[12:59:01] <R13ose> Okay
[12:59:14] <robertmaxrees> .submit() takes a function - testing(mdata) isn't returning a function.
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> so it's running testing(mdata) on pageload and assigning the return as the submit hanlder.
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> and with that, gotta jet.  enjoy :)
[13:00:16] <R13ose> taplar: if I want to make this live, where should I put this?
[13:00:47] <taplar> you cannot make it live
[13:00:58] <taplar> you have to change your logic to function differently
[13:01:23] <taplar> you could store the result of the selector, and use that variable in the methods to call the serializeArray, but serializeArray, no matter where you call it, is not live
[13:01:37] <taplar> *the results are not live
[13:03:38] <R13ose> So should I be saying var mdata = $("#email"); and then serializeArray in testing function?
[13:04:37] <taplar> you can do that, yes
[13:04:38] <R13ose> taplar: ^
[13:05:12] <taplar> If you do that, mdata will contain the DOM element, which will reflect any changes to it in the DOM at the point you use it in the testing function
[13:06:35] <R13ose> In testing function, I should do var mdata = mdata.serializeArray();
[13:07:03] <taplar> I believe that's valid, though I would avoid the reuse of the variable name
[13:07:12] <R13ose> Okay
[13:07:50] <R13ose> Now onto the .submit, is what was said correct?
[13:08:24] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[13:08:55] <taplar> there are two versions of the submit method.  One takes a function, the other takes nothing
[13:09:04] <taplar> the one that does not take anything, submits the form
[13:09:16] <taplar> the one that takes a function, is creating an event handler for the submit event
[13:11:25] <taplar> So with that in mind, consider what this is doing: $('form').submit(testing(mdata));
[13:11:53] <R13ose> Are you saying I need to use another event handler after I add a click Eventlistener?
[13:12:14] <taplar> lets take a step back.  what was your intention for writing that line of code?
[13:12:43] <taplar> to submit the form, or to make an event listener?
[13:14:04] <R13ose> After the button is clicked, I want mdata to be passed into testing function.  Maybe I don't need form.submit
[13:14:21] <taplar> Do you?
[13:14:38] <R13ose> I don't think so
[13:14:45] <taplar> so remove it, :)
[13:15:04] <taplar> click button => call method passing data
[13:15:15] <taplar> none of that involves submitting the form, or making a new binding
[13:15:51] <R13ose> True
[13:21:32] <R13ose> taplar: now mdata in testing function is an object array { email: "test@test.com" } yet the serializeArray version is not being combined with x for some reason. I called the serializeArray var ugs
[13:22:04] <taplar> you got an updated fiddle?
[13:22:13] <R13ose> Let me do that
[13:26:05] <R13ose> New Code: https://jsfiddle.net/1rL05mfq/2/
[13:26:10] <R13ose> taplar: ^
[13:26:26] <taplar> ok, and you said something about not combining with 'x'?
[13:28:06] <R13ose> Line 216
[13:29:28] <R13ose> taplar: ^
[13:29:34] <taplar> yeah i saw it
[13:30:07] <taplar> so you're logic is not combining the data with x
[13:30:13] <taplar> it's combining the data into ugs
[13:30:28] <taplar> Array.prototype.push.apply(ugs, x);
[13:30:39] <taplar> the left operator is what everything is being pushed to
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> that's also not how you use apply.
[13:32:19] <R13ose> I want ugs to be the first item in the array and everything in x to follow
[13:33:07] <taplar> that line is taking all the elements in the x array and adding them to the ugs array
[13:33:25] <taplar> pop this in your browser console
[13:33:27] <taplar> var x = [1, 2, 3]; Array.prototype.push.apply(x, [4, 5]); console.log(x);
[13:35:37] <R13ose> Does the right thing but the log of x is undefined
[13:35:53] <taplar> no, the undefined is for the console.log
[13:36:06] <taplar> console.log does not have a return value
[13:37:54] <R13ose> Okay
[13:38:44] <R13ose> I am unsure what that means for my code
[13:39:30] <taplar> well you said "yet the serializeArray version is not being combined with x for some reason. I called the serializeArray var ugs".  I'm pointing out that that line does not change what x contains
[13:41:16] <R13ose> Okay I get that
[13:45:18] <R13ose> Yet mdata is not in the right format in testing as far as I can tell so don't add anything to ugs array.  How do I fix that?
[13:49:24] <taplar> for some reason when i log mdata I get Object { email: 'the value' }
[13:49:41] <R13ose> Me too
[13:49:45] <taplar> you can't serialize on that.
[13:50:55] <taplar> so that's your next task.  figure out why that's not a jQuery object
[13:56:18] <R13ose> I am using mdata but shouldn't I be using e instead?
[13:58:33] <taplar> you need to add some console logs or debug statements and see what is going on with your logic.  Or look for all cases where you are changing mdata and see what is happening.
[13:58:43] <taplar> i have to step away for a sec to deal with some office stuff
[13:58:48] <R13ose> Okay
[14:18:42] <R13ose> I am confused and have debug but not getting any closer to the correct answer.  I know line 49 is making the mdata change but unsure how to get the correct format for jQuery object.  Any thoughts?
[14:19:20] <robertmaxrees> got an updated fiddle?
[14:20:11] <R13ose> Same as last one #2
[14:20:16] <robertmaxrees> link?
[14:20:22] <robertmaxrees> so i don't have to go digging :)
[14:20:37] <R13ose> https://jsfiddle.net/1rL05mfq/2/
[14:21:16] <robertmaxrees> so mdata is a jquery object.
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> so doing mdata[sadf;kljhasf] isn't a good idea.
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> do you want the value of #email?
[14:22:33] <R13ose> Yes
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> and you want mdata to be an array?
[14:23:33] <R13ose> Yes so I can serializeArray that
[14:24:18] <robertmaxrees> except that won't update if the value changes.
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> you want mdata to be the array, right?
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> because mdata[$("#email")[0].name] = $("#email").val(); is adding a property to the object, but not an array index.
[14:26:38] <taplar_afk> also given that mdata *is* the email, that line really doesn't make sense
[14:26:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:27:22] <R13ose> True
[14:29:35] <robertmaxrees> R13ose have you considered taking a course on js basics?
[14:29:53] <R13ose> Yes after I am done this project
[14:30:49] <R13ose> I understand some of js but so many people are telling me to do this and that
[14:31:19] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - you're missing some fundamentals that'd really help you get through this project :)
[14:33:04] <R13ose> Well how do I fix my issue?
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> make mdata an array and then .push() things into it as needed.
[14:34:32] <taplar_afk> i actually wanted to suggest another possible route.
[14:34:37] <taplar_afk> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#form
[14:34:45] <taplar_afk> and bypass this whole mess
[14:35:12] <robertmaxrees> hah, that's another way.
[14:37:50] <R13ose> You are saying get the full form?
[14:39:22] <taplar_afk> input elements can have a "form" attribute on them, as that page details.
[14:39:23] <robertmaxrees> that url is pointing to a description of an attribute that can associate an input to a form, even if the form isn't a containing element.
[14:39:36] <robertmaxrees> jinx
[14:40:21] <taplar_afk> the idea being, by associating the input with the form, it should be included in the serialization of the form.  so you do not have to manually add it
[14:41:28] <R13ose> True
[14:41:42] <R13ose> This worked out.
[14:41:56] <R13ose> Thanks
[14:42:10] <R13ose> Sorry for all my problems
[14:43:13] <robertmaxrees> it's what we're here for.  but i'd definitely go through those tutorials now.  a little time investment will actually help you finish your project earlier.
[14:44:29] <R13ose> Can I be putting to good tutorials?
[14:44:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:45:19] <R13ose> pointed*
[14:45:26] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> codecademy
[14:45:42] <R13ose> Thanks
[14:45:46] <robertmaxrees> mdn
[14:47:53] <R13ose> Good to know
[15:20:02] <R13ose> I used the wrong data.
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:21:35] <taplar> pikard said that all the time
[15:23:51] <R13ose> I am using the form data but they want to know if the answer is correct or not.  So the submit answers button goes away and when they click check answer that goes to the testing function but what is the correct way to get if the answer is correct or incorrect in an array?
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> depends on the response you're getting back from the server.
[15:25:38] <R13ose> This is not in an array format as far as I can tell
[15:26:05] <robertmaxrees> your problem statement and clarification are both confusing and assume that we know exactly what you're looking at :)
[15:26:19] <R13ose> The same jsfiddle
[15:26:28] <robertmaxrees> i can't see the server response in that fiddle :)
[15:26:38] <robertmaxrees> unless that's not what you're referring to.
[15:26:44] <R13ose> You don't need to
[15:26:52] <robertmaxrees> so confused lol
[15:29:06] <R13ose> All I am saying is the if on 155 and 169.  Making sure I have an array of the correct or incorrect questions.
[15:29:30] <robertmaxrees> let me go hunt for the fiddle again.
[15:29:31] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:30:00] <R13ose> Correct is check and incorrect is times.
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> er,.
[15:30:25] <robertmaxrees> for starters const allanswer = document.querySelectorAll('#answermarker'); doesn't make sense.
[15:30:30] <robertmaxrees> you can only have an ID once per page.
[15:32:04] <R13ose> That should be a var?
[15:32:11] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> i cannot repeat an ID on a page.
[15:32:33] <R13ose> Okay
[15:33:19] <robertmaxrees> *i = you
[15:33:40] <R13ose> I get that
[15:33:48] <robertmaxrees> so you need to fix that part first :)
[15:44:05] <R13ose> Fixed Code: https://jsfiddle.net/xazktg5m/
[15:44:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's the confusion now?
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen, and what's actually happening?
[15:47:45] <R13ose> Instead of getting the form items into the array which I am doing now. I need to get the correct or incorrect into the array when you push check answer and move that to testing.
[15:48:41] <robertmaxrees> into what array?  readingcomp?
[15:49:33] <R13ose> Into a JSON array.
[15:49:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you've lost me.
[15:50:11] <R13ose> You see in testing function we have ugs and x?
[15:50:24] <robertmaxrees> Array.prototype.push.apply(ugs, x); this?
[15:50:45] <R13ose> Before that the var's
[15:50:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:52:41] <R13ose> I want to change var x so instead of getting the form items, this will know when you push check answer this is correct or incorrect and push the right JOSN data there.  Make sense?
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that array is for.
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i gotta go.
[15:53:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy :)
[15:54:11] <R13ose> taplar: ^ any thoughts?
[17:11:39] <timmay02> helo?
[17:11:59] <taplar> hola
[17:11:59] <robertmaxrees> timmay02 http://www.nohello.com/ ;)
[17:15:45] <timmay02> hola
[17:16:36] <taplar> got a question?
[17:17:08] <timmay02> ya
[17:17:31] <taplar> fire away man
[17:17:44] <timmay02> ok
[17:19:24] <timmay02> i was wondering if you can use jquery to do the same affect as this. https://twitter.com/drake
[17:19:41] <timmay02> when the user scrolls down the navbar does that effect
[17:19:56] <taplar> sticky scroll
[17:20:05] <taplar> yeah you can do that with jQuery
[17:20:13] <timmay02> it stickies to the top and then the image dissapears and then the name slides up
[17:20:59] <timmay02> can you explain how i would get the sliding effect to work or is there a tutorial that explains how to do this?
[17:20:59] <taplar> pretty much anything you can do with javascript you can do with jQuery.  jQuery is just a javascript library.
[17:21:26] <taplar> Not me personally.  I've never implemented something like that before.  I'd have to point you towards google.
[17:22:06] <timmay02> jquery is a version of javascript? and javascript is a version of java?
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:22:17] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a js library.
[17:22:23] <robertmaxrees> javascript is a separate language from java.
[17:22:33] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with each other than the name.
[17:27:16] <timmay02> how would i google to find that sliding effect?
[17:27:19] <timmay02> what do i search?
[17:27:31] <timmay02> what is that effect called?
[17:27:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar said it up above
[17:32:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
