[00:16:51] <vacho> I also wonder when running $('select[name=inverter_manufacturer_publicly_traded]').change(); it shows the elements, even though line 3 is false
[00:16:58] <vacho> hello everyone
[00:17:03] <vacho> this function works as expected, but I want to hide the elements on line 7,8 on load ... what is a good way to achieve that? https://paste.ofcode.org/qBthUgrJwvjfnnVagNDE5K
[01:11:09] <itsgokul> help im not retrieving stateobj variable value on 3rd page in history api
[02:26:40] <itsgokul> function(x=null) syntax error in chrome works in firefox
[02:28:26] <pavonia> Default parameters are not widely supported yet
[02:32:38] <itsgokul> i need some help implementing history.api
[02:33:10] <itsgokul> i used history .pushstate to save and it saves variables fine
[02:33:46] <itsgokul> but i  need to click browser back button twice for back page
[02:37:39] <itsgokul> help window popstate only being triggered after 2 back clicks ..
[02:48:34] <Cork> itsgokul: was about to give you this yesterday but you left http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bqmyMB
[02:48:59] <Cork> note that when you click the back button the first time you get "second"
[02:49:03] <Cork> and then first
[02:49:07] <Cork> and then null
[02:49:12] <Cork> that is expected
[02:50:05] <itsgokul> i have done  it only issue is i have to click back button two times
[02:50:56] <Cork> itsgokul: then your pushing two states in the hisotyr
[02:51:00] <Cork> *history
[02:51:12] <itsgokul> no i checked that also
[02:51:31] <Cork> load the jsfiddle and check the console as you hit the back button
[02:51:34] <Cork> opps
[02:51:37] <Cork> the codepen :)
[02:51:50] <Cork> (had to use codepen as jsfiddle doesn't work with pushState)
[02:52:12] <itsgokul> in address bar when i click back button it shows #page2, when i click once more it shows # then once more then #page1
[02:52:38] <Cork> ya, means you pushed #page1, then # and then #page2
[02:52:58] <Cork> remove the extra push then it won't have that entry
[02:53:32] <itsgokul> i also did history.replacestate(null,null,null) on documen ready
[02:53:36] <itsgokul> document
[02:54:09] <itsgokul> i dont think i pushed extra # because i checked that using alert everytime i push
[02:55:46] <Cork> uh, why replace null null null???
[02:56:25] <itsgokul> initializing?
[02:57:42] <Cork> what?
[02:58:18] <itsgokul> reset history?
[02:58:36] <Cork> you can't reset history
[02:59:05] <itsgokul> then what should i pass in replacestate
[02:59:20] <Cork> well if you want the first entry to contain the state
[02:59:31] <Cork> nistory.replaceState({ myState: something }, document.title, location.href)
[02:59:37] <Cork> h*
[03:00:02] <Cork> for anything other then that just forget it you can't control anything other then that level
[03:00:06] <itsgokul> history.replacestate is triggered on page load right?
[03:00:13] <Cork> no
[03:00:23] <Cork> it is executed when you execute it
[03:00:31] <Cork> in your care on document.ready
[03:00:56] <Cork> replaceState is the same thing as pushState with the difference it replaces the current position instead of adding a new one
[03:01:02] <itsgokul> i used history.push on before executing ajax function in afunction
[03:02:51] <itsgokul> is replacestate necessary
[03:02:56] <Cork> no
[03:06:44] <itsgokul> see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5121666/when-the-back-button-triggers-popstate-how-can-i-prevent-a-page-refresh
[03:08:13] <itsgokul> not that one see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9634518/popstate-need-to-click-twice-on-back-button-to-actually-get-back
[03:11:51] <Cork> itsgokul: i've used the pushState for about three years in production, and the codepen i gave you doesn't have the problem
[03:12:00] <Cork> so no, it isn't a common problem, fix your code
[03:13:10] <itsgokul> i was using window.onpopstate =
[06:10:01] <sigdk> https://jsfiddle.net/0h3hffa6/1/     Language is printed twince at the beginning... and the on.("change"... doesn't seem to work. Any hint?
[06:34:12] <graingert> sigdk: 	$("#languageSelector").on("change",	() => printLanguage(defaultLanguage));
[06:34:27] <graingert> sigdk: but you need to pull the language out of the element
[06:34:45] <graingert> sigdk: languageSelector is a terrible name for an ID
[06:34:50] <graingert> you know it's a selector already
[06:37:15] <xec> well. it's better than #language
[06:40:08] <xec> sigdk: like graingert suggested, .on() takes a callback (either a function or fat arrow =>) - you can also access the new value using this.value inside the callback: https://jsfiddle.net/0h3hffa6/5/
[06:41:04] <xec> the way you had it before, you called printLanguage immediately, and sent the result back as the change handler
[06:41:24] <xec> (and since printLanguage() didn't return a function that would not work)
[06:42:20] <Ice_Strike> What is correct way to store td block as a template?
[06:42:29] <Ice_Strike> without putting td in the table
[06:42:45] <Ice_Strike> Can I put td block outside of table as hidden?
[06:42:53] <Ice_Strike> so that jquery can clone that
[06:43:40] <graingert> Ice_Strike: store it as a string in your JS
[06:44:09] <Ice_Strike> eww
[06:44:10] <graingert> Ice_Strike: const tmpl = "<td>your content template </td>"; $(tmpl);
[06:44:11] <Ice_Strike> really?
[06:44:23] <Ice_Strike> graingert it is like 5 lines  :/
[06:44:52] <Ice_Strike> graingert What is wrong not storing in html page?
[06:44:55] <Ice_Strike> rather then js
[06:45:26] <graingert> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/yR20TdAF/
[06:45:29] <graingert> Ice_Strike: ^
[06:46:02] <Ice_Strike> Hmm interesting
[06:46:03] <Ice_Strike> Thanks
[06:46:12] <graingert> if you want it in a file, use webpack file-loader
[06:46:27] <graingert> or https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader
[06:46:53] <irondew> Hello, someone here got a minute?
[06:47:36] <graingert> Ice_Strike: it's best to decouple your page from your JS
[06:51:37] <xec> Ice_Strike: alternatively you can use the <template> tag, or <script type="text/html"> if you need to support old browsers
[06:53:41] <xec> irondew: if you have a question, just ask it
[06:55:44] <Ice_Strike> Is this how would you do it for append? https://jsfiddle.net/vLx89bz5/
[07:01:48] <Cork> Ice_Strike: https://jsfiddle.net/vLx89bz5/1/
[07:02:02] <Cork> you want to try to reduce the number of appends you do as it is expensive
[07:02:32] <Ice_Strike> What is .join('')?
[07:12:09] <Cork> Ice_Strike: [].join('')
[07:12:29] <Cork> Ice_Strike: add the different html partials in an array and join them
[07:12:34] <Cork> it is to make the code more readable
[07:13:49] <Ice_Strike> Ah I see, thanks.
[07:13:50] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/kLh2gk35/
[07:14:33] <Ice_Strike> How can you add field.old_{{type}} from type varible
[07:14:57] <Ice_Strike> so example, would be: field.old_stock
[07:15:29] <xec> you could also cache the selection outside the loop so you don't have to lookup the table in the DOM for each iteration
[07:15:52] <Ice_Strike> It is  :)
[07:16:03] <xec> https://jsfiddle.net/vLx89bz5/2/
[07:16:05] <xec> oh ok :)
[07:16:08] <xec> good :)
[07:16:29] <Cork> Ice_Strike: is this always suppose to do into .table > body?
[07:16:39] <Cork> *to go into*
[07:16:45] <Ice_Strike> yea
[07:18:20] <Cork> Ice_Strike: https://jsfiddle.net/kLh2gk35/1/something like that then
[07:18:41] <Cork> what this does is: $.map loops over types and you do what ever you need for each loop
[07:18:52] <graingert> Ice_Strike: don't couple your templates to dom manipulation
[07:19:00] <Cork> it constructs the data for each types into the rows array and joins it at the end
[07:19:04] <graingert> Use a template library and loader
[07:19:07] <Ice_Strike> Would  if (field.old_ . type > field.new_ . type) { } work?
[07:19:07] <Cork> $.map creates an array of all responses
[07:19:12] <Cork> no
[07:19:19] <Cork> and then you join them at the end
[07:19:40] <graingert> Then it will create a function that takes an object with data and renders it into your template
[07:19:41] <Cork> Ice_Strike: what is that line suppose to do?
[07:19:55] <Ice_Strike> So that it will become field.old_stock
[07:20:01] <Cork> ah
[07:20:11] <Cork> field['old_' + type]
[07:20:19] <Ice_Strike> Oh awesome.
[07:20:33] <Ice_Strike> Isnt that array?
[07:20:41] <Cork> no
[07:20:49] <Cork> [''] is the same as dot separation
[07:21:02] <Cork> dom.value => dom['value'] <-- identical in js
[07:21:41] <Ice_Strike> Nice
[07:21:51] <Cork> heck even $().prop('href') $()['prop']('href')
[07:22:00] <Ice_Strike> I am not expert in js, how does array to compare with object
[07:22:01] <Cork> (again identical)
[07:22:14] <Cork> for accessing no difference
[07:22:29] <Cork> the difference is arrays use [] for creation and objects {}
[07:22:34] <Cork> objects has keys and values
[07:22:42] <Cork> keys are auto assigned in arrays
[07:22:55] <Cork> (and you are suppose to use push and pop)
[07:23:07] <Ice_Strike> I see, I will have to learn about this.
[07:24:21] <Ice_Strike> Why this wouldnt work
[07:24:28] <Ice_Strike> var tdInventory[type] = $(tdTemplate);
[07:24:44] <Cork> if you use an object it would
[07:25:10] <Cork> the $.map loop couldn't ever use strings if you go that route though
[07:25:29] <xec> "var tdInventory[type] = ..." doesnt really make sense
[07:25:31] <Cork> cause you can't join strings and dom elements and get something useful
[07:25:48] <xec> like you wouldnt do "var myObj.property = ..." either
[07:25:50] <Cork> ya, the var is unneeded
[07:26:01] <Cork> the engine will just ignore it though
[07:27:02] <xec> i get syntax error (unexpected [)
[07:27:15] <Ice_Strike> I am thinking PHP :P
[07:27:21] <Ice_Strike> I get mixed it :)
[07:27:34] <Cork> xec: hmm might have been forbidden in strict mode
[07:27:50] <xec> it wouldnt make sense in PHP either though
[07:28:15] <xec> Ice_Strike: you'd want to first initialze an object, then use it (without var)
[07:28:39] <xec> like: var myOjb = {}; myObj["whatever"] = value;
[07:28:48] <Cork> ya, it looks like it has been forbidden in js since i used it by mistake back in the days :)
[07:29:50] <Ice_Strike> Yea I got that working :)
[07:29:52] <Cork> what you can do that might be more interesting is to create the tr as a dom element
[07:30:01] <Cork> and then just add the things to it you want to have
[07:30:14] <Cork> and then you can just return row[0] in the $.map loop
[07:32:12] <Cork> Ice_Strike: https://jsfiddle.net/kLh2gk35/2/
[07:36:10] <Ice_Strike> Hmm thank you.
[07:47:19] <Ice_Strike> Any idea why this wont work
[07:47:28] <Ice_Strike> trRow.append('</tr>');
[07:47:28] <Ice_Strike> rowsBlock.append(trRow);
[07:47:44] <Ice_Strike> and then after loop: $('.table > tbody').html(rowsBlock);
[07:47:48] <Cork> Ice_Strike: you can't append half a dom element
[07:48:23] <Cork> jquery and browser works with dom not html
[07:48:30] <Cork> so </tr> has no meaning
[07:48:41] <Cork> you create a tr and you append things to it
[07:48:46] <Cork> there are no close
[07:48:56] <Cork> tr is the parent of what you append to it
[07:49:26] <Ice_Strike> Cork https://jsfiddle.net/m843ba7t/
[07:49:51] <Cork> Ice_Strike: trRow is a tr
[07:49:57] <Cork> line 21 is pointless
[07:50:06] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/m843ba7t/1/
[07:51:19] <xec> arguably, '<tr>' is not valid html on its own so you could do var trRow = $('<tr></tr>');
[07:51:21] <Cork> also you never create rowsBlock, what ever that is suppose to be
[07:51:22] <xec> and then append to it
[07:51:35] <xec> which will put things inside the tr
[07:51:39] <Ice_Strike> var rowsBlock = $('');
[07:51:39] <Cork> xec: '<tr>' isn't html
[07:51:43] <Ice_Strike> before the loop?
[07:51:53] <Cork> $('') checks for a string starting and ending with <>
[07:52:08] <Cork> and if it does it does document.createElement(string between <>)
[07:52:37] <Ice_Strike> So how would you var rowsBlock?
[07:52:38] <Cork> Ice_Strike: should just be an array it looks like
[07:52:41] <xec> well not quite, you can send complex html strings to $()
[07:53:12] <Cork> xec: yes and if it has <> inside the string it won't go that route
[07:54:01] <xec> not sure i follow
[07:54:28] <Ice_Strike> Well, multiple tr's get into trRow
[07:54:30] <xec> you're saying jquery will do something different for $("<tr>") and $("<tr></tr>") ?
[07:54:35] <Ice_Strike> I mean rowsBlock
[07:57:04] <Cork> xec: var rsingleTag = ( /^<([a-z][^\/\0>:\x20\t\r\n\f]*)[\x20\t\r\n\f]*\/?>(?:<\/\1>|)$/i );
[07:57:40] <Cork> if that regex matches the string given to $() it will run the match through document.createElement(match)
[07:57:57] <xec> i see
[07:58:02] <xec> is that documented anywhere?
[07:58:18] <Cork> so $('<tr>') is a short hand for $(document.createElement('tr'))
[07:58:21] <xec> i just looked at the docs and they recommend well formed html -- To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed. Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing tag:
[07:58:24] <Cork> not sure might be for jQuery
[07:59:08] <Ice_Strike>  rowsBlock.append(trRow); dodnt seem to work :(
[07:59:58] <Cork> xec: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#creating-new-elements
[08:00:02] <xec> Cork: yeah i found it a bit further up
[08:00:31] <xec> seems like $( "<a></a>" ) or $( "<a>" ) would both short circuit to .createElement
[08:00:33] <Ice_Strike> Problem is not displaying on the browser
[08:00:57] <Cork> xec: yup, so why have the extra characters
[08:01:03] <Cork> Ice_Strike: what you want to do is create an array and do rows.push(trRow[0]) and then append the array
[08:01:14] <xec> so it makes sense for Ice_Strike to not do </tr> later on :)
[08:01:26] <Cork> var rows = []; rows.push(trRow[0]) ... .html(rows)
[08:01:53] <Cork> well it isn't only cause of that
[08:02:03] <Cork> you can't append unclosed html to the page either
[08:02:04] <Ice_Strike> I have found a problem
[08:02:14] <Ice_Strike> I was doing
[08:02:17] <Ice_Strike> var rowsBlock = $('');
[08:02:20] <Ice_Strike> and that didnt work
[08:02:27] <Cork> Ice_Strike: please read what i've said twice noe
[08:02:29] <Ice_Strike> var rowsBlock = $('<div>');
[08:02:34] <Ice_Strike> seem to fix it
[08:02:38] <Cork> you can't have a div inside a table
[08:02:41] <Ice_Strike> I know
[08:02:44] <Ice_Strike> I was testing
[08:02:48] <Ice_Strike> it get displayed
[08:02:48] <Cork> so read what i've told you to do
[08:05:34] <Ice_Strike> Cork That is working
[08:05:35] <Cork> anyway what i was about to say before is var div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = '<a>something>'; div.innerHTML += '<span>'; div.innerHTML += 'else'; div.innerHTML += '</span></a>'; isn't going to work either
[08:05:36] <Ice_Strike> Thank you.
[08:05:42] <Cork> xec: ^
[08:06:06] <Cork> the core problem is the dom will have to fix broken html before it can store it cause it can't store broken html, as it has no way to represent it
[08:07:35] <sonu_nk> i am showing a "<div id='form'></div>" in my docs.. what should i say there  " The form will render in this script ." or "The form will render in this div" ?
[08:08:58] <Ice_Strike> Cork Doing rows.push(trRow[0]) and rows.push(trRow) seem to work same way
[08:09:20] <Cork> Ice_Strike: the later won't work when you append it
[08:09:38] <Cork> Ice_Strike: the later appends a jquery object with a dom element inside it
[08:09:50] <Cork> and jquery doesn't provide a way to append an array of jquery objects
[08:16:33] <sigdk> graingert, 1) what name would you use for the selector ID? 2) is there any other way to write this: () => printLanguage(defaultLanguage));  ? Is it portable? My IDE complains that it's not valid (yet works tbh)
[08:16:58] <Cork> sonu_nk: why say anything?
[08:17:16] <graingert> sigdk: it's portable, there's a C implimentation of a JS implimentation that impliments that syntax
[08:17:28] <sonu_nk> just for let them what is this script for Cork
[08:17:44] <graingert> sigdk: fix yo IDE
[08:18:06] <graingert> sigdk: and go configure https://neutrino.js.org/presets/neutrino-preset-web/
[08:18:07] <Cork> well the syntax will get warning if you ide expect es5
[08:18:17] <Ice_Strike> Does append add to top or bottom?
[08:18:21] <Cork> if it supports es6 it won't warn
[08:18:22] <graingert> sigdk: it will set you up with () => {} on modern browsers
[08:18:27] <graingert> and ancient browsers
[08:18:31] <graingert> Cork: ES2015
[08:18:40] <Cork> no es isn't dates
[08:18:50] <Cork> its es5, es6 and es7
[08:18:58] <Cork> es7 is the current working spec
[08:20:23] <Cork> and and you can't build syntax in js
[08:20:36] <Cork> what you most likely have is a transpiler that converts es6 to es5
[08:26:15] <Cork> and also not sure i call ie11 ancient
[09:15:00] <graingert> Cork: no such thing as ES7
[09:15:08] <graingert> Cork: ES6 was never released as such
[09:15:20] <graingert> they renamed it to ES2015 prior to release
[09:15:28] <graingert> Cork: ES7 has never existed
[10:01:01] <Justice> i have https://jsfiddle.net/0p083yn5/ i got a click listener on the span. What way is the fastest/best to get the input?
[10:01:17] <Justice> i know you can do parent().find(input) but is there a better way?
[10:02:10] <Justice> i found siblings() but does it exclude elements of other types?
[10:03:00] <pavonia> .prev() would work if they are adjacent siblings
[10:04:34] <Cork> siblings('input')?
[10:08:05] <Justice> Cork: will try that too
[10:24:01] <Es0teric|Work> alright i am going to need a little help with this.. https://jsfiddle.net/cu6q86jp/1/ i am trying to make it so that on click, the .fav/unfav is toggled anf the count is shown in fav_count.. how would i go about that?.. some of my code is already there
[10:25:52] <pippolo> hi
[10:26:04] <pippolo> upload file not open on webview android 4.4  this is my code: $("<input/>", {name: 'file[]', type: 'file', id: 'file', validate: 'true', required: 'true', capture: 'camera', display: 'none', accept: '.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png', multiple: 'multiple'})
[10:28:12] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: how could line 6 ever be true?
[10:29:50] <Justice> a good way for elipsis on left other than direction'?
[10:30:29] <taplar> Justice: what do you mean?
[10:31:02] <Justice> instead of [tex...] => [...ext]
[10:31:21] <taplar> how is that js/jquery related?
[10:31:40] <Justice> hehe tried in #html channel but could not post for a reason ;(
[10:31:54] <taplar> you may have to be a registered user
[10:31:56] <Es0teric|Work> taplar well i was thinking that if the user clicked the .fav that the else would hit and it would become true
[10:32:18] <taplar> Justice: if you are not registered and do not know how to, hop into #freenode and ask
[10:32:35] <Justice> im a user on freenode,
[10:32:36] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: you are setting it to false right above it though
[10:32:43] <Es0teric|Work> yes
[10:32:46] <Justice> but probably the channel needs one too.
[10:32:51] <taplar> Justice: and you are authenticated?
[10:32:55] <Justice> yup
[10:33:45] <Justice> but nothing in topic, maybe its in moderated mode for some reason
[10:33:45] <pippolo> upload file not open on webview of android 4.4  this is my code: $("<input/>", {name: 'file[]', type: 'file', id: 'file', validate: 'true', required: 'true', capture: 'camera', display: 'none', accept: '.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png', multiple: 'multiple'})
[10:34:05] <taplar> you have to be authenticated Justice.  i just tried and it refused my message until i was identified
[10:34:27] <Justice> taplar: authed on freenode or in channel?
[10:34:56] <taplar> This nickname is registered. Please choose a different nickname, or identify via /msg NickServ identify <password>
[10:35:05] <taplar> you have to identify your nick with the server before you can talk in some rooms
[10:35:25] <Justice> but thing is im already authed against freenode, i mean im in archlinux channels that need auth too.
[10:35:42] <taplar> *shrug* maybe ask #freenode about it
[10:35:43] <Justice> but maybe some error will try to relog =)
[10:36:58] <Es0teric|Work> taplar ?
[10:39:10] <Justice> taplar: meh seems they quiet the webchat users ;(
[10:39:34] <Cork> the question is for #css though not #html
[10:39:37] <Cork> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow
[10:39:43] <Cork> the answer is in there
[10:40:05] <Cork> specifically https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow#Result
[10:40:49] <Cork> Justice: ya, cause webchat users very VERY often come ask a question wait for a minute then quit
[10:41:15] <Justice> hm will need to install a good windows irc client then ;/
[10:41:30] <Cork> Justice: can recommend hexchat
[10:41:39] <Cork> works on windows, linux and mac
[10:41:54] <Cork> anyway you've got your answer already .)
[10:42:18] <Justice> both =)
[10:42:52] <taplar> by quiet you mean it looks like my messages went to them but they don't actually see them?
[10:43:05] <taplar> or would it tell me i am quieted?
[10:43:21] <Cork> he gets a message that he can't send cause he is +q
[10:43:36] <Cork> it is commonly done for qna
[10:43:40] <taplar> ah, in that case you could try the webclient https://kiwiirc.com/client which is what i use
[10:44:29] * Cork waits until too many kiwiirc users will start doing the same thing and it gets it too :P
[10:44:44] <taplar> that will be the day i actually get upset
[10:44:45] <taplar> lol
[10:44:52] <taplar> nevermind my suggestion!
[10:45:01] <Cork> na, its a fine suggestions
[10:45:04] <pippolo> upload file not open on webview of android 4.4  this is my code: $("<input/>", {name: 'file[]', type: 'file', id: 'file', validate: 'true', required: 'true', capture: 'camera', display: 'none', accept: '.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png', multiple: 'multiple'})
[10:45:08] <jquery521> Is it possible to search through a client side jquery pagination, like easyPaginate? http://st3ph.github.io/jquery.easyPaginate/
[10:45:16] <Cork> the problem isn't with the client per se, but how users use it
[10:45:31] <jquery521> I know you can search through jquery on client side, but I'm not sure how I could go about searching paginated objects
[10:45:37] <Cork> pippolo: do you actually append the input to the page?
[10:45:47] <Justice> Cork: seems it can only be done in js ;(
[10:45:49] <taplar> heh, this is pretty much the only room i hang out in so i don't really care
[10:45:56] <Cork> Justice: uh...
[10:46:03] <Cork> you weanted ... at the beginning right?
[10:46:19] <Justice> yes issue is i got trailing slashes because its an url
[10:46:28] <Cork> did you check the link i gave you?
[10:46:48] <pippolo> Cork that is?
[10:46:49] <Justice> Cork: yes but if you use direction it will work however trailing slashes will move to left also
[10:47:01] <Cork> Justice: read again
[10:47:35] <pippolo> Cork: yes, i include the input to the page
[10:47:37] <Cork> specifically: direction: ltr => text-overflow: ellipsis clip => …3456
[10:47:43] <Es0teric|Work> ok so is anyone else going to attempt to help me with my problem
[10:47:44] <Es0teric|Work> ?
[10:48:07] <Cork> though you might have to look through caniuse for what browsers support that
[10:48:24] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: got side tracked.  can you talk more about your goal?  from this logic it looks like you plan on having multiple fav things?
[10:48:25] <Cork> Es0teric|Work: don't ask for ppl ask the question
[10:49:07] <pippolo> Cork my code is $("<input/>", {name: 'file[]', type: 'file', id: 'file', validate: 'true', required: 'true', capture: 'camera', display: 'none', accept: '.gif,.jpg,.jpeg,.png', multiple: 'multiple'})
[10:49:20] <taplar> pippolo: you've pasted that 4 times now
[10:49:27] <Cork> pippolo: ya, that creates an element, but what do you do with it
[10:50:07] <pippolo> Cork choose file
[10:50:27] <Cork> uh
[10:50:44] <Cork> pippolo: $() creates an element, unless you actually insert it in a page noone will see it
[10:50:51] <pippolo> Cork on Windows is ok, on webview android 4.4 not ok
[10:51:16] <Cork> also if its a webview android specific problem this is prob the wrong channel to ask
[10:51:23] <Cork> try #android maybe?
[10:51:46] <pippolo> Cork yes, insert it in a page
[10:52:08] <Es0teric|Work> taplar
[10:52:12] <Es0teric|Work> so how would i solve this?
[10:52:19] <taplar> did you see my last question?
[10:52:22] <Es0teric|Work> no
[10:54:06] <pippolo> Cork i tryed in Andoird and Android-dev , but they say that the problem is of nature jquery and hence to ask into jquery
[10:54:19] <Justice> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/seoys3xq/ using ltr as direction makes special chars to move aswell so trailing slashes in urls http://someurl/ becomes /http://someurl
[10:54:20] <Justice> =)
[10:55:53] <Cork> pippolo: if it works in normal browsers but not in there specific case, then no
[10:56:09] <Cork> pippolo: you could try doing it with native dom and see if you get the same problem
[10:56:38] <Cork> meaning var input = document.createElement('input'); input.name = 'file[]'; ...
[10:56:45] <Es0teric|Work> taplar so yeah, my goal is to just fav/unfav multiple divs when the user clicks on a icon
[10:56:48] <Es0teric|Work> thats my end goal
[10:56:50] <Cork> pippolo: if that fails give them THAT code then they can't hide
[10:56:59] <pippolo> for normal browser it is ok, but for webviewer of Android this not ok
[10:57:09] <Cork> ya, so see what i just gave you
[10:57:31] <Es0teric|Work> taplar but i also want to be able to show the fav count... so if someone unfav's something it should go -1 or just remove the number
[10:57:32] <Cork> we can't help you as there isn't anything wrong with the line (at least the very very little you've shared)
[10:58:21] <taplar> so you are going to have multiple fav icons, along with keeping a sum of the total number of favs.  and clicking the same fav repeatedly toggles the count +1/-1.  true?
[10:58:40] <Es0teric|Work> taplar correct
[10:58:55] <taplar> is every fav going to belong to the fav_container?
[10:59:09] <Es0teric|Work> yes
[10:59:15] <jquery521> In response to my earlier question, i am using a page set up like this, where the elements exist on page already. Is there a way I could search through the objects using jquery? https://jsfiddle.net/gwd7hcmy/2/
[11:00:45] <taplar> ok, so how are you going to determine if a fav icon should do the +1 or the -1?
[11:01:15] <Es0teric|Work> taplar i just put the code
[11:01:36] <taplar> not looking at the code.  conceptually, how are you going to do that?
[11:01:36] <Es0teric|Work> thats how i was trying to determine it
[11:01:55] <taplar> in english, tell me how you are going to do that. :)
[11:02:17] <Es0teric|Work> taplar i have a ajax call that fills in the number of favs that a post currently has
[11:03:00] <taplar> so we've gotten past that point.  we now have fav elements that can be clicked.  how do i know if it should do the +1 or the -1?
[11:04:54] <Es0teric|Work> depending if the div currently has any fav count then i would do a +1 or -1
[11:05:09] <taplar> how does a div have a fav count?
[11:05:14] <Es0teric|Work> dude
[11:05:16] <Es0teric|Work> ajax call
[11:05:56] <taplar> and what do you mean each div?  there is only one div in your example which is the container.  and you said they all are in a container
[11:06:11] <taplar> or are you saying each single fav has it's own container?
[11:06:14] <Es0teric|Work> taplar there are multiple divs which contain the same divs within each container
[11:07:06] <taplar> are you saying that html block in the fiddle is going to repeat over and over and over?
[11:08:01] <Es0teric|Work> taplar yes
[11:08:47] <taplar> and i guess the count could be loaded with the ajax with some count from all other users who have faved it?
[11:08:50] <pippolo> Cork i try but not working
[11:08:56] <pippolo> Cork i tryed but not working
[11:09:05] <Es0teric|Work> taplar yes
[11:09:14] <taplar> alright, i'm more on track with you
[11:09:33] <taplar> ok, so, you are saying if the count has a number the fav icon was clicked?
[11:10:12] <Es0teric|Work> yes
[11:10:28] <taplar> but the count could have a number from other users
[11:10:35] <taplar> without me clicking it
[11:10:41] <Es0teric|Work> right
[11:10:49] <taplar> so that's a problem, no?
[11:11:23] <Es0teric|Work> no
[11:11:55] <Es0teric|Work> taplar wait i am not following you with that
[11:11:57] <Es0teric|Work> actually
[11:12:32] <taplar> we just said if the count has a number we assumed the fav was clicked, but we also just said that the count could have a number based off of other users clicking, not me, which would mean it was actually not clicked.  which is inconsistent
[11:12:58] <Es0teric|Work> right
[11:12:59] <Es0teric|Work> yeah
[11:13:07] <Es0teric|Work> so that would be a problem, currect
[11:13:08] <Es0teric|Work> *correct
[11:13:09] <taplar> the existance of the count doesn't directly specify that i clicked the fav icon
[11:13:14] <Es0teric|Work> right
[11:13:20] <taplar> so you can't rely on that to know if it is clicked or not
[11:13:25] <Es0teric|Work> right
[11:13:53] <taplar> so taking it further, you got logic here binding to '.fav' and '.unfav'
[11:14:32] <Es0teric|Work> RIGHT
[11:14:32] <taplar> how are those related?
[11:14:38] <Es0teric|Work> well
[11:14:42] <Es0teric|Work> i am binding to functions that currently exist
[11:15:00] <Es0teric|Work> .fav and .unfav are just there because each anchor has a .fav class
[11:15:19] <Es0teric|Work> a .fav and .unfav class *
[11:15:31] <taplar> they all have both classes?
[11:15:36] <Es0teric|Work> no
[11:15:47] <Es0teric|Work> when you click .fav, .unfav is added and .fav is removed
[11:15:53] <taplar> where?
[11:15:54] <Es0teric|Work> so that logic is already there
[11:16:01] <Es0teric|Work> its in another part of the code
[11:16:06] <Es0teric|Work> i didnt put that part because its too large
[11:16:12] <Es0teric|Work> but know that it exists
[11:16:17] <taplar> ok, so here's the thing.  do you understand how bindings work?
[11:16:27] <Es0teric|Work> not completely... ?
[11:16:44] <taplar> if i do $('.jimmy').on('click', function(){});  what does that do?
[11:17:11] <Es0teric|Work> it refers to the context of .jimmy html element of being clicked
[11:17:27] <taplar> what do you mean refers to the context of jimmy?
[11:17:43] <Es0teric|Work> the .jimmy html element
[11:17:58] <taplar> ok
[11:18:10] <taplar> so if later i take off that class from those elements.  what happens?
[11:18:31] <Es0teric|Work> those elements wont have it
[11:18:37] <taplar> oy
[11:18:40] <taplar> sorry.  'it'?
[11:19:55] <sigdk> <h1 id="myselector"><a href...>foo</a></h1>      How am I supposed to change the "foo" to "bar"? This:  $("myselector:first-child").text("bar");  didn''t work
[11:20:25] <taplar> myselector:first-child find where the myselector is the first child iirc
[11:20:33] <taplar> not the nested children
[11:21:14] <taplar> if there is only one nested child, do you need to do anything other than finding the nested a?
[11:21:20] <Es0teric|Work> taplar it being the class from the element being removed
[11:21:46] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: true.  but how would that affect the binding i did before?
[11:22:37] <sigdk> taplar, no. There is only one nested child and it's <a>
[11:22:53] <taplar> so why not just find that a?
[11:23:07] <taplar> '#myselector a'
[11:24:18] <sigdk> taplar, hmm, thanks. I didn't know it works like that
[11:24:35] <taplar> it's just like css selectors
[11:24:44] <taplar> for the most part, with some extras here and there
[11:27:59] <sigdk> taplar, any idea how to translate my page? I have a selector for each label and on page load I call: function translateLabels(language) { /* change the .text() of each selector here */ }   - user can switch between languages
[11:28:27] <sigdk> sounds decent?
[11:28:50] <Es0teric|Work> taplar give me one se
[11:28:51] <Es0teric|Work> *sec
[11:28:52] <taplar> i don't see anything wrong with it
[11:28:58] <Es0teric|Work> i am doing a lot of things right now simultaneously
[11:29:09] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: np, same
[11:29:42] <sigdk> taplar, I 've recently seen mustache.js ... I was wondering whether that would be better
[11:30:10] <sigdk> I mean use a template
[11:30:35] <taplar> for just swapping out text, i wouldn't think so.  rebuilding the whole thing just to change particular text, imho, is very heavy
[11:33:41] <dni-> jo tapler!
[11:33:49] <taplar> sup
[11:34:03] <teta> I have a jqgrid which in the bottom the last line in explorer gets cut down like in half
[11:34:04] <dni-> just wanted to say hi! ;)
[11:34:13] <teta> in google chrome it looks fine
[11:34:17] <teta> any suggestion?
[11:34:32] <taplar> ah, cool. yo! :D dni-
[11:41:25] <dni-> :)!
[11:42:55] <Es0teric|Work> ok taplar
[11:42:58] <Es0teric|Work> where did we leave off?
[11:43:46] <Es0teric|Work> ok so we left off at binding... see i dont fully understand binding so what did you mean by [11:21 AM] •  « taplar » Es0teric|Work: true.  but how would that affect the binding i did before?
[11:44:20] <taplar> $().on(event,handler) is creating an event binding for the event on the elements selected
[11:44:44] <Es0teric|Work> taplar right
[11:45:10] <taplar> so say i later remove the class from the elements that was used to do that binding.  how does that affect the binding?
[11:46:41] <Es0teric|Work> well depending at which point in time i do it it can either overwrite the current binding or create new binding
[11:47:48] <taplar> doesn't really answer the question though
[11:48:56] <Es0teric|Work> taplar so then whats the answer?
[11:48:57] <Es0teric|Work> i dont get it
[11:49:22] <taplar> it doesn't affect it at all
[11:49:31] <Es0teric|Work> o
[11:49:33] <Es0teric|Work> ok *
[11:49:50] <taplar> the bindings are associated with the elements.  the only thing the class is used for is the finding of the element to bind to
[11:50:04] <taplar> so if you change the element to not match that later, it doesn't matter.  it's not an on going evaluation
[11:50:21] <taplar> likewise, if you change others to match it, it doesn't magically put that binding on them
[11:50:42] <taplar> comprende?
[11:54:16] <Es0teric|Work> taplar right but how does that affect what i currently have im my code though?
[11:54:38] <Es0teric|Work> i see that you're trying to walk me through the thought process but i still dont understand how its tangible to my code given is that its already written
[11:54:49] <taplar> so if we look at your code you are binding on '.fav' and '.unfav' and you said other logic is flipping that class on things
[11:55:04] <Es0teric|Work> right
[11:55:21] <taplar> given what we just talked about the nature of bindings, what's something to consider with that logic
[11:56:32] <Es0teric|Work> ok
[12:00:08] <taplar> left off the ? by accident.  i meant that as a question if it was ambiguous.
[12:07:32] <Es0teric|Work> taplar idk
[12:07:43] <Es0teric|Work> idk what to consider about that logic because i still dont get it
[12:08:21] <taplar> well, you're binding to elements that have '.fav' or '.unfav' and elements don't have both at the same time right?
[12:08:48] <taplar> so some elements will have the fav binding on them, while others the unfav binding.  right?
[12:11:00] <Es0teric|Work> correct
[12:11:46] <taplar> ok, so lets say one has the fav binding and then the user clicks it.  some other logic you said changes the class to be unfav instead of fav
[12:12:00] <taplar> but we already said that element only has the fav binding
[12:13:56] <jquery153> Hey there, I was in here earlier asking about searching through pagination. I came up with a solution, however list.js does not offer a simple prev/next button. I built a custom set up but it seems to overwrite it on click, any ideas how I could stop this? https://jsfiddle.net/gwd7hcmy/8/
[12:14:42] <Es0teric|Work>  taplar ok i am following you so far
[12:14:52] <taplar> isn't that a problem?
[12:15:00] <Es0teric|Work> yes
[12:15:08] <Es0teric|Work> how would that be solved?
[12:15:19] <taplar> you can instead use a delegated binding
[12:15:24] <taplar> are you familiar with them?
[12:15:27] <Es0teric|Work> no
[12:15:33] <taplar> alright, one sec
[12:15:54] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:16:23] <taplar> $(existingParentSelector).on(event, childSelector, handler)
[12:16:50] <taplar> the concept here is that events bubble from child elements up through the DOM
[12:17:20] <taplar> so you delegate bind on a parent of the (future)child element and it will check if the event originated from a child that matches the childSelector
[12:17:58] <taplar> so changes to the element affect if it matches that childSelector or not
[12:18:37] <taplar> i'll let you read that and come up with some ideas.  i'm gonna run and get lunch real quick
[12:18:57] <Es0teric|Work> taplar_lunch ok
[13:08:46] <Es0teric|Work> taplar you there?
[13:08:55] <taplar> yep
[13:09:04] <Es0teric|Work> alright i am still stuck on this
[13:09:44] <taplar> what have you come up with so far?
[13:09:50] <Es0teric|Work> nothing
[13:09:56] <Es0teric|Work> just been trying to understand event delegation
[13:10:06] <taplar> alright, so what's confusing you about it?
[13:10:12] <pippolo> Cork with native dom no problem
[13:10:23] <Es0teric|Work> taplar everything
[13:10:28] <Es0teric|Work> but thats besides the point
[13:10:57] <Es0teric|Work> taplar i see that you're trying to guide me to the answer here but its not working
[13:11:09] <Es0teric|Work> if i see how its done then i can figure out where i was going wrong
[13:11:11] <taplar> one sec
[13:13:24] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/8yv7wnuu/
[13:14:13] <Es0teric|Work> taplar ohhh i see
[13:14:24] <Es0teric|Work> you're chaining the on click events
[13:14:29] <Es0teric|Work> because you are listening for both
[13:14:33] <taplar> sure, but you don't have to
[13:14:40] <taplar> i just did that so i didn't have to find the div multiple times
[13:14:46] <Es0teric|Work> i see
[13:14:57] <Es0teric|Work> ok so then within those clicks is where i store/find the count right?
[13:15:01] <taplar> they could be separate.  the point here is the delegate bindings with their child selectors
[13:15:23] <taplar> you'd change the count in each one
[13:15:49] <taplar> you don't need to keep another variable of 'clicked'.  you know if it was previously clicked before or not by the class
[13:19:37] <Es0teric|Work> taplar so then if thats the case all i have to do is grab the count then add or subtract right?
[13:19:46] <taplar> yep
[13:28:57] <Caspan> can someone help me here
[13:28:57] <Caspan> https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen
[13:29:14] <Caspan> i want to install just the JS file I have in the past
[13:29:28] <Caspan> but there seems to be no JS file for the GitHub repository
[13:29:37] <Caspan> what am i missing here
[13:29:46] <Caspan> there should be a chosen.jquery.min.js
[13:30:22] <Caspan> or is it this user has named all JS files .cofee?
[13:30:30] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/0xoHAII.png
[13:30:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:30:59] <Caspan> i have been there it downloads exactly what is on his GitHub page
[13:31:09] <Caspan> do you have to use an insteller to install this package?
[13:31:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:31:20] <Caspan> what happened to simple upload one file and link to it??
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/agFX0XJ.png
[13:31:57] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[13:31:58] <Caspan> complied?
[13:32:00] <robertmaxrees> also: npm.
[13:32:05] <robertmaxrees> .coffee is coffeescript.
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> superset of javascript.
[13:32:19] <Caspan> ahh
[13:32:24] <robertmaxrees> compiles down to JS.
[13:32:44] <Caspan> i get so confused by these github repositories
[13:32:56] <Caspan> why do peopel write them like this why not just prode a JS file?
[13:33:04] <robertmaxrees> because they want to keep the repo clean.
[13:33:05] <Caspan> is JS not cross platform?
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> and not check in compiled files.
[13:33:14] <robertmaxrees> which is pretty common.
[13:33:25] <Caspan> ok
[13:33:33] <robertmaxrees> npm is a thing, too :)
[13:33:39] <Caspan> maybe i dont understand i didnt know things had to be compiled for JS
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> coffeescript dos
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> *does
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> it's not js when you write it
[13:34:05] <robertmaxrees> so the engine can't do anything with it.
[13:34:21] <Caspan> gotcha
[13:34:51] <Caspan> things like sass?
[13:34:53] <Caspan> or less
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> those compile to css
[13:35:01] <robertmaxrees> same story.
[13:35:04] <Caspan> okay
[13:35:17] <Caspan> man webdevelompment it gettign so complicated :)
[13:35:34] <robertmaxrees> it can feel that way sometimes.  there are some real benefits though.
[13:36:48] <Caspan> thank you!
[13:37:02] <bjsnider> i go to bed, everything's working. i wake up, load up the page again, a key line was missing and everything's borked
[13:37:29] <bjsnider> i was fooled by some overzealous caching i guess
[13:38:14] <bjsnider> it's not really working unless i can shut down the browser, restart it, reload the page, and it passes all the tests
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> clear cache and go incog, too.
[13:39:10] <bjsnider> i no longer trust ctrl+f5
[13:39:19] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't with chrome, either.
[13:39:21] <Caspan> Clear Session is a great plugin for Chrome to test clearing your session to pretend like a new visitor
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> Caspan incognito does the same thing.
[13:39:33] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:39:37] <Caspan> that too
[13:39:58] <Caspan> i like clicking one button on my browser, im lazy
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider closing the browser doesn't clear cache necessarily fwiw.
[13:40:14] <Caspan> Caspan, the lazy IT admin
[13:40:21] <robertmaxrees> Caspan s'why i use the keyboard shortcut for it.
[13:40:42] <bjsnider> it wipes out the session
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider not necessarily.
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> not everything at least.
[13:42:27] <bjsnider> should also test in more than one browser
[13:42:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> and depending, more than just one version of a browser.
[13:55:48] <sigdk> how can I refer to an id in a different file? I'm actually using data-target of bootstrap... currently I have all in one file https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9f311b8fdcbfc06bfe43076179a7fc1e
[13:57:00] <robertmaxrees> sigdk gotta load the file somehow.
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> ajax or otherwise.
[13:58:06] <sigdk> hmm... I have no clue what you talk about
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> if it's in a separate file, you need to get its contents into the current page.
[13:58:42] <robertmaxrees> you could do a server-side include.  you could also use ajax.
[14:33:12] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, does the included site need to have html/head/body tags or just a div is also OK? - or both are possible?
[14:33:42] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what you're doing.
[14:34:01] <robertmaxrees> if you're just going to ajax it in or do it server-side, don't include them.
[14:39:47] <sigdk> I'm using bootstrap. I can trigger a modal and display a form on it like this: data-toggle="modal" data-target="#formToDisplay"    ... I am trying to "externalize" the html form code to a different file
[14:40:45] <robertmaxrees> getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-options
[14:40:50] <robertmaxrees> tells you exactly what you want to do.
[14:43:20] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, thank you
[15:19:59] <bjsnider> my reset button doesn't work if the inputs were filled server-side
[15:20:26] <bjsnider> i'm just using find input.val('')
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> doesn't work?  or doesn't do what you want it to do?
[15:20:52] <bjsnider> it blansk everything out if i look at the console, but not in the browser window
[15:21:02] <robertmaxrees> "if i look at the console"?
[15:21:12] <bjsnider> unless i type a value in myself
[15:21:40] <robertmaxrees> confused about what you're looking.  reset just reverts the element to the default value.
[15:22:08] <bjsnider> i'm doing find('input').val(''));
[15:22:11] <bjsnider> not reset()
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> should work just fine.
[15:22:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it break.
[15:23:22] <bjsnider> if i put it in console.log, it shows me the inputs blanked out, but it doesn't change the page
[15:23:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something is way off then.
[15:24:16] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/4sub69u8/
[15:24:17] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[15:49:31] <bjsnider> ok, this was the issue
[15:49:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:49:59] <bjsnider> the button i had coded was an input with type="reset"
[15:50:40] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:50:45] <DelphiWorld> hey
[15:50:57] <bjsnider> when the form loads with initial values already set, that button didn't blank them out, because as far as it was concerned, the defaults were already there
[15:51:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:51:09] <bjsnider> so changing to typ="button" fixed
[15:51:38] <bjsnider> the strange thing is i thought i had overridden the type with javascript
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> oh it was doing both.
[15:51:55] <robertmaxrees> the clear and then the actual reset.
[15:52:44] <bjsnider> what if i had started with preventdefault?
[15:53:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it.
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> but if you don't want the reset behavior, don't use that attribute.
[15:53:24] <robertmaxrees> problem solved :)
[15:53:43] <bjsnider> unfortunately if you're right that it did both, it happened so fast that i couldn't see it, or i might have guessed myself
[15:54:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:56:03] <bjsnider> that answered a questioni had about the definition of "default value", ie. whatever it loaded with server-side
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the docs on mdn explain that.
[16:29:28] <PCatinean> Hi guys, I got a pretty strange framework that develops its own automated testing framework. And in it I do select.val(option_value).change() it changes the value but the change() is not propagated
[16:29:39] <PCatinean> And code that should get triggered onchange does not fire
[16:29:46] <PCatinean> Any idea if it's related to a newer library or something?
[16:49:59] <MassDebates> PCatinean:  Random question, because I think this would be an amazing coincidence
[16:50:05] <MassDebates> Do you pay around $2k/month for about 12 sites using the AI?
[16:57:10] <PCatinean> MassDebates, ney
[16:57:17] <PCatinean> not THE AI
[16:58:47] <WhirledPress> PCatinean, does the .val method return a jquery object for chaining? I didn't think that it did, so your change handler is never assigned.
[16:59:26] <WhirledPress> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:00:32] <WhirledPress> but I suppose select.on("change", changehandler).val(something) would work.
[17:19:04] <taplar> if you are using val() as a setter it returns the jquery object
[17:25:47] <shoky> gah jquery sucks sometimes
[17:26:07] <taplar> heh
[17:26:14] <shoky> wasted like 5 hours isolating a memory leak
[17:26:19] <shoky> http://jsbin.com/casavitaqu/1/edit?html,js,output    :\
[17:27:24] <shoky> at least i *think* it's jquery's fault
[17:34:15] <taplar> where are you seeing the leak?  i did a heap snapshot before and after running the leak button and mem usage went from 15MB to 15.2MB for me
[17:35:37] <shoky> taplar: in chrome's task manager for example,  and also if i record in the timeline view you can see the DOM node count fly up high
[17:35:54] <taplar> k
[17:35:54] <shoky> (even though there's only really ~100 elements in the DOM at any time)
[17:36:21] <shoky> lemme know if you see that too though, i'm curious
[17:37:15] <sickup> any JS guru mind helping fix an issue loading the most recent images from a flickr account appear in the right order on a website?
[17:38:04] <robertmaxrees> sickup if you have a jquery question, just ask :)
[17:38:23] <taplar> nodes jumped from 17 102 -> 143 in my timeline
[17:38:28] <sickup> its not exactly jquery
[17:38:35] <taplar> nodes jumped from 17 102 -> 143 881 in my timeline
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> might get better help from ##javascript then, sickup :)
[17:39:13] <shoky> taplar:  are those separate numbers or you mean  17102 -> 143881 ?
[17:39:31] <taplar> yes
[17:39:42] <shoky> to the latter? :p
[17:40:24] <taplar> yeah.  some reason chrome is putting a space in between the numbers
[17:40:32] <shoky> ah k
[17:40:51] <shoky> so yeah, quite the leakage
[17:40:54] <taplar> let me try it with the non leaking version you have
[17:41:03] <sickup> some reason its not letting me talk in #javascript
[17:41:24] <shoky> you might see it go up with that version too, but clicking "Collect garbage" button brings it back down
[17:41:34] <shoky> while it doesn't, in the jquery version
[17:43:08] <taplar> 16k -> 123k
[17:44:16] <shoky> but it's collected by GC ?
[17:44:31] <taplar> i'll do it again and hit GC before stopping the recording
[17:44:56] <shoky> i actually didn't check the DOM node count with the GC button - only looked at the tab memory consumption in chrome task manage
[17:44:57] <shoky> r
[17:46:03] <taplar> where is that at?
[17:46:24] <taplar> ah, nvm
[17:48:57] <taplar> 125k -> 146k -> 132k -> 126k(GC)
[17:50:41] <taplar> leaky version: 124k -> 341k -> 312k -> 290k(GC)
[17:50:55] <taplar> yeah, pretty big diff
[17:54:12] <shoky> taplar: not really sure why you're getting those numbers.. when i start from scratch, record timeline, then click leak, wait till its done and then stop recording. i see the number jump from like 45 to ~120k
[17:54:48] <shoky> taplar: then i collect GC and  record again and leak again and stop.  in the jquery version i'll see it now jump from the previous 120k to like 250k or smth,
[17:55:10] <shoky> while in the non-jquery one,  it again jumps from a really low number like 400  to 120k~
[17:55:39] <shoky> so in jquery case the DOM nodes just don't get GC'd at all it seems
[17:58:29] <shoky> i don't see the node count go down during the recording, but in the next recording i see it's down, anyway
[17:59:59] <taplar> dunno, i don't see anything in the source that would hold a reference
[18:01:24] <shoky> how come you had 125k nodes though in the non-jquery one
[18:01:48] <shoky> is that when just starting from scratch in a new tab? or after leaking some
[18:02:26] <taplar> dunno, i'm wondering it was grouping my webclient and jsbin tab together since i clicked the link from here.  cause i opened a new tab and pasted the url in there and they were not grouped together in the task manager anymore
[18:02:49] <shoky> o
[18:03:02] <shoky> i test it in a new incognito tab
[18:05:09] <taplar> k, incongnito base line for the non leaky version is 32k
[18:06:00] <taplar> 58k after killing timeline
[18:06:22] <taplar> 41k after GC
[18:09:56] <taplar> leaky 43k base, 239k after timeline stop, 216k after GC
[18:14:30] <shoky> taplar: that's DOM node counts?
[18:14:51] <taplar> the memory from the task manager
[18:14:54] <shoky> ahh
[18:15:11] <shoky> uhh
[18:15:17] <shoky> and you divided by 100 or what?
[18:15:21] <shoky> 1000
[18:15:46] <shoky> you mean 32mb, not 32k, yea?
[18:15:51] <taplar> no, just if it was like 43,812K i said 43k
[18:16:00] <shoky> yeah, that's dividing by 1000 :P
[18:16:08] <taplar> k, ^_^
[18:16:11] <shoky> wat :P
[18:18:25] <shoky> so yeah, leaky one just keeps rising in mem usage
[18:20:04] <taplar> so if i compare the two allocation timeline captures
[18:20:45] <taplar> the leaky version has a "(compiled code)" and "(array)" category that exceed the allocation usage of the HTMLUnknownElement which is present in both
[18:21:06] <shoky> exceeds the allocation usage of.. ?  how can you tell that?
[18:21:12] <shoky> and what does it mean :P
[18:21:30] <taplar> the report sorts the retained size descendingly
[18:21:46] <shoky> ohh i misread, nevermind
[18:21:56] <taplar> compiled code used about 54k and the array used 40k
[18:22:21] <shoky> yea sounds familiar from my attempts earlier.. i didnt manage to get much useful info out of it :|  but i rarely do
[18:23:03] <taplar> a big chuck of that is probably jquery using anonymous functions
[18:23:06] <shoky> i think only the heap snapshot can be of use here maybe.. because it shows info about DOM nodes too
[18:23:12] <shoky> not that i know how to interpret it
[18:24:38] <shoky> or does that info you wrote tell you something?
[18:25:02] <taplar> the compiled code really makes me think of anon functions
[18:25:38] <taplar> i know in the past in shop we've went on deep dives trying to increase performance and anonymous methods seem to be one place where we got some performance boosts out of jquery
[18:26:02] <shoky> yeah well, i'm doing exaclty one jquery call there
[18:26:48] <shoky> which doesn't include any closure, afaict
[18:27:15] <taplar> lets see, access uses one, but it's not in a loop
[18:29:00] <shoky> you mean here?  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a6b0705294d336ae2f63f7276de0da1195495363/src/manipulation.js#L403
[18:29:25] <taplar> yeah.  it's not a loop so it's not a biggie
[18:29:53] <shoky> it's also not a closure around the dom node, notice it's being passed the value
[18:30:20] <taplar> yeah
[18:31:24] <taplar> yeah i dunno
[18:31:25] <shoky> and the leak also happens if instead of .html(..) i do   container.innerText = '';  $(container).append( d );
[18:31:44] <shoky> actually not sure about that, maybe it was something different i tried
[18:33:10] <taplar> i mean it looks like all things said and done domManip is going to do appendChild just like you are
[18:34:36] <shoky> ya i've no idea either.. stuff i found googling was all about old leaks with old-IE and the expando stuff
[18:35:18] <shoky> anyways thanks for indulging me in these trials ;)
[18:35:38] <taplar> sure, i always find leaks interesting t some extent, :)
[18:37:47] <shoky> robertmaxrees: noticed you joined a bit after i asked/ranted. maybe you'd be curious to see what's up with this leak too :p   http://jsbin.com/casavitaqu/1/edit?html,js,output
[18:38:40] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[18:39:30] <robertmaxrees> so jQuery(container).html( d );?
[18:40:16] <shoky> yeah, that should get rid of the elements that were there before, but seems jquery keeps them from getting GC'd for some reason
[18:41:06] <shoky> <taplar> where are you seeing the leak?  <shoky> taplar: in chrome's task manager for example,  and also if i record in the timeline view you can see the DOM node count fly up high
[18:41:21] <shoky> <shoky> (even though there's only really ~100 elements in the DOM at any time)
[18:41:45] <shoky> the rest i think you were here for :p
[18:49:15] <taplar> wow
[18:49:24] <taplar> try this
[18:49:40] <taplar> $container.html( d.outerHTML ); (i cached the container before hand)
[18:50:01] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't have the leak?
[18:50:25] <taplar> it looks like the task manager shows memory goes back down to about where it started
[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> but leakMemory should only run once, no?
[18:50:55] <robertmaxrees> oh!
[18:51:03] <taplar> it's running 1000 times from the loop, no?
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> no.  it runs 1000x.  i r cna reed
[18:51:58] <taplar> so unless i'm construing something, the process that jquery does to turn the dom element into the html or whatever is where the potential leak is
[18:52:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:52:28] <taplar> you see the same thing shoky?
[18:52:46] <robertmaxrees>  this.context = this[0] = selector;
[18:52:59] <robertmaxrees> you're basically storing a tun of references within the constructor.
[18:53:11] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[18:53:54] <taplar> anyway, yay!  lol.  i'm heading home
[18:53:59] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:54:37] <taplar> i'll read the logs later to see if you guys found any more fun stuff
[19:02:15] <shoky> sorry, making food,
[19:06:17] <shoky> robertmaxrees: hmm, but why wouldn't they get GC'd ?
[19:06:35] <shoky> taplar: in case you actually do read this - yes i'm seeing the same thing :P
[19:07:30] <robertmaxrees> my (quite ample) gut tells me it has something to do with the way it's beind called, but don't quote me on that.
[19:07:40] <shoky> lol
[19:07:52] <shoky> with the way i'm calling it?
[19:07:58] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a reference in the DOM back to the js.
[19:08:18] <robertmaxrees> or a reference somewhere else - since you're spitting out so many jquery objects you have these references in memory floating around maybe?
[19:08:41] <Neo_122> hi
[19:08:51] <Neo_122> who know how make sticky div
[19:09:13] <Neo_122> I use stycky.js plugin and it how it stop in my parent element bottom ?
[19:09:41] <shoky> robertmaxrees: are you referring to  jQuery(container) in my code?  or the constructors that jquery is calling internally ?
[19:09:54] <robertmaxrees> the more I look at it, jQuery(container)
[19:09:59] <Neo_122> there is function unsticky() and it need summon when inside div will acheave bottom
[19:10:03] <shoky> hm
[19:10:09] <robertmaxrees> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.constructor
[19:10:52] <robertmaxrees> so basically you're spitting out 1000 of these new objects into memory.
[19:11:34] <robertmaxrees> why they don't get GC'd properly...?  that reference is still there.
[19:12:03] <shoky> robertmaxrees: but now i'm testing with  $container.html( d )   i.e. with a cached $container instead of  $(container)
[19:12:08] <shoky> and it's still leaking the same~
[19:12:27] <robertmaxrees> are you caching before the function?
[19:12:42] <shoky> yeah
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> O.o hummmmmmm
[19:12:58] <shoky> http://jsbin.com/qujaditihu/edit?html,js,output
[19:14:22] <robertmaxrees> ho ho ho.
[19:14:23] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[19:16:36] <Rockwood> i am looking for ready-made jquery templates
[19:17:04] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood "jquery templates"?
[19:17:11] <robertmaxrees> shoky https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.buildFragment i wonder if this is part of the issue.
[19:17:27] <robertmaxrees> and https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=domManip
[19:18:11] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood not familiar with the concept of a "jquery template" since it's not really a framework.
[19:23:10] <shoky> robertmaxrees ya prolly has to do with buildFragment, based on taplar's last example with passing an html string
[19:24:24] <shoky> now to eat that food i made...
[19:35:42] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, i m noob for jqery thing
[19:37:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't really have themes...
[19:37:54] <robertmaxrees> you mean jquery ui?
[19:38:53] <Rockwood> i dont know diff in ui ? robertmaxrees
[19:55:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a full library for frontend stuff.
[19:55:20] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually looking for Rockwood?
[20:01:13] <Rockwood> i wanna make an gaming theme its work on all king of devices (means responsive) with nice slider on body
[20:17:13] <shoky> taplar: if you're still reading.. it seems that it's not leaking in firefox...
[20:39:53] <Neo_122> guys who know why offset output 0 if it not in top ?
[20:40:02] <Neo_122> it depend on container ?
[20:40:15] <Neo_122> div in the middle and offcet show 0
[20:40:23] <Neo_122> it's something wrong
