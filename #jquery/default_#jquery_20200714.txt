[02:45:15] <Obsdark> hello good people, when playing an HtmlAudioElement is there any way to evaluate when the code ended? or some specific position?
[02:45:30] <Obsdark> i search arround, found a question in StackOverflow but i fear wasn't really usefull
[02:45:33] <robertmaxrees> Obsdark you want ##javascript for that one :)
[02:45:38] <Obsdark> thank you
[08:26:39] <robertparkerx> How could I paginate a ul
[08:28:13] <robertparkerx> I think I found something
[11:00:35] <codecutter> need to verify a username after the completed typing, what event do i need?
[11:00:40] <codecutter> mouseremove?
[11:00:51] <codecutter> user completed*
[12:43:01] <robertmaxrees> codecutter change would be a good option for that.
[12:43:17] <robertmaxrees> that'll validate once they leave the input.
[12:43:21] <codecutter> yea, what i went with
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> could also use input to check on each char.  few different options :)
[12:43:43] <codecutter> didn't realise i was still connect :)
[12:43:54] <codecutter> connected*
[13:46:32] <physikoi> hey #jquery. Why might a scroll trigger on larger viewports, but not on smaller viewports? ty
[14:02:53] <LittleMerman> Guys I need a countdown plugin that starts at 10 mins to add to my site, its a cart page, that the user has 10 mins to checkout before the item gets returned to availability.
[14:03:00] <LittleMerman> anyone has some recommendation?
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> physikoi would have to see the bug in action.
[14:04:49] <robertmaxrees> LittleMerman hrm.  i might re-think that strategy if the timing really is that critical.  might be smart to have the timer "sync" with your server occasionally to make sure they both match.
[14:05:54] <LittleMerman> robertmaxrees sorry I dont get your point, im really new to this programming, due to this pandemic
[14:06:04] <LittleMerman> can you give me example why i need it sync with my server?
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> :) you have a lot to learn.
[14:06:25] <robertmaxrees> becuase if they fall out of sync, you'll piss off end users at the checkout phase, which is a great way to lose customers.
[14:06:47] <LittleMerman> I mean the countdown timer is always 10 mins after they choose an item
[14:06:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:07:07] <robertmaxrees> what if the user chooses more than one item?
[14:07:59] <LittleMerman> yes, it can be, but the page where the user chooses one or more items is the same, only one button, theres no more "hey let me add more items" button
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> So the user can only have one thing in the cart at a time?
[14:08:47] <LittleMerman> he can have more, but once he presses the "add" wherein he already picked one or more items, then the countdown starts
[14:09:03] <LittleMerman> theres not much items
[14:09:09] <LittleMerman> its only 1 page of items
[14:10:01] <LittleMerman> ive been searching google for plugin on this, but i cant seem to find one that is free
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  not trying to be difficult here - I work in ecommerce on a product team that focuses solely on cart and checkout, and this idea seems odd :)
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> at its core, what you want in just a simple countdown timer plugin.
[14:11:24] <LittleMerman> yes yes, just a simple countdown timer plugin
[14:11:34] <LittleMerman> do you have something to recommend sir?
[14:11:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd just wind up on google :)
[14:12:59] <robertmaxrees> a few things to consider: what happens when the user adds the product to cart, leaves the page, and then comes back within that 10 minute time limit?
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> what if the user adds to cart, then goes back to your product page and adds more?
[14:13:29] <LittleMerman> what do you mean leave the page? you mean he close the page?
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> i mean clicks the back button, goes back to the homepage, etc.
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> end users do all sorts of strange things.
[14:14:04] <LittleMerman> im thinking of tying up the timer to a user session
[14:14:24] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[14:14:33] <LittleMerman> do you agree to my aproach sir?
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> lol pls don't call me "sir" lol
[14:14:54] <LittleMerman> sorry
[14:15:16] <LittleMerman> its shorter than typing your name here so..
[14:15:18] <LittleMerman> :D
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> and yes/no?  depending on the industry, locking inventory when somebody adds something to cart is kind of strange.
[14:18:06] <LittleMerman> the issue im trying to resolve is, when one customer adds something to cart, then another user adds to his cart the same item, say we have 5 items left, but first user buys all 5, then 2nd user buys same item, we need to tell 2nd user that item is not available anymore but the first user has 10 mins to complete the cart or the item becomes
[14:18:06] <LittleMerman> available again
[14:18:38] <LittleMerman> its like a reservation
[14:18:45] <LittleMerman> but valid for 10 mins only
[14:24:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> what sort of stuff are you selling?
[14:24:35] <robertmaxrees> and is this an issue that's actually come up?
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> I ask because there are definite tradeoffs to consider with that solution.
[14:25:41] <LittleMerman> im selling homemade food, to be delivered. i cook them myself so the variety is very little
[14:26:15] <LittleMerman> i have to do this because i lost my job
[14:26:46] <robertmaxrees> I'm really sorry to hear that :( i'm trying to figure out if this feature is even worth pursuing.
[14:27:37] <LittleMerman> its okay, i just dont want my customers to be frustrated like they are expecting the food but i can only cook limited number of specific food
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, but if it hasn't been a problem yet, i might spend your time elsewhere and worry about that if it becomes a problem.
