[07:30:22] <robertparkerx> How could I get the closest button id and submit it https://jsfiddle.net/s3b9jL75/3/
[07:31:41] <Cork> robertparkerx: dom don
[07:31:49] <Cork> *'t have a "closest"
[07:32:02] <Cork> you can search for the first button inside a specific parent
[07:32:12] <Cork> but not closest in related to a position
[07:32:25] <Cork> so ex. $(this).closest('form').find('button')
[07:32:54] <Cork> thought that said, it is a submit so you could just do $(this).closest('form').submit()
[07:33:26] <robertparkerx> but I want to get the value of the edit
[07:33:46] <robertparkerx> in $_POST
[07:34:10] <Cork> i would set that as a hidden field instead then
[07:34:36] <Cork> (submit button values doesn't work for ajax anyway so if you ever plan to use that you can't if you go this route)
[08:00:16] <robertparkerx> Cork, I got the button id
[08:00:17] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/s3b9jL75/8/
[08:00:34] <robertparkerx> How can I click a button with that id?
[08:00:52] <Cork> why get the id, you already have the element
[08:00:55] <robertparkerx> I tried ('#' + button_id).click
[08:01:10] <robertparkerx> I'm going to hide the button
[08:01:31] <Cork> you can try, but i wouldn't guarantee it will work
[08:01:47] <robertparkerx> I can't get it to click
[08:01:51] <Cork> values on buttons are a very old legacy solution, that doesn't work well
[08:02:34] <Cork> also why are you grabing the element, then unwrap the jqeury object and then wrap it agan, to then find it by the id
[08:02:50] <Cork> your walking over the river for water... twice...
[08:03:00] <robertparkerx> :(
[08:03:11] <Cork> $(this).find('button[type=submit]').click() will do the same thing
[08:04:00] <Cork> and if that doesn't work, then something is doing something in the page not in the jsfiddle
[08:05:10] <robertparkerx> I get maximum call stack size exceeded
[08:05:24] <Cork> ah, right
[08:05:33] <Cork> cause you have a click handler on a parent element
[08:05:35] <Cork> so it loops
[08:06:00] <Cork> well click attribute, but it loops just the same
[08:28:50] <robertparkerx> Okay so I'm trying a counter on parent element and using a for loop
[08:29:01] <robertparkerx> I have to wait for someone to stash to try it
[08:31:10] <robertparkerx> https://gist.github.com/robertparkerx/5a1ac1d15c00a9df7a1b73018801cf37
[08:32:07] <Cork> uh... no nooo nope, noway
[08:32:33] <Cork> robertparkerx: have you any idea how jquery works or are you just slapping things together and see if it works?
[08:32:45] <robertparkerx> I know some
[08:37:16] <robertparkerx> I thought set a specific class and looping through possibilies for specific click trigger would eliminate the loop
[08:37:52] <Cork> robertparkerx: if you just want to grab all the elements matching a specific selector just create a delegated event handler
[09:27:52] <superyuper> how to get each fruit in each div
[09:27:52] <superyuper> https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/5xf4pgok/17/
[09:28:29] <superyuper> when Click "Get chosen fruit"
[09:28:33] <Cork> you mean you want to wrap each button in a div?
[09:28:40] <superyuper> yes :)
[09:29:16] <superyuper> I want an array. but the output should only be "text"
[09:29:27] <Cork> well you will have to create a separate div for each
[09:29:36] <Cork> and preferably not with xss problems
[09:29:57] <Cork> does it have to be outside the each loop?
[09:30:14] <Cork> (cause then you will have to have two)
[09:30:33] <superyuper> Cork.. haha ofcourse :)  https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/5xf4pgok/20/
[09:30:46] <superyuper> tired ;)
[09:31:28] <Cork> superyuper: https://jsfiddle.net/a4dn35q6/
[09:31:35] <Cork> avoid html concatination
[09:31:44] <Cork> especially when it isn't needed
[09:32:01] <Cork> opps missed a closing parantecis https://jsfiddle.net/a4dn35q6/1/
[09:32:03] <superyuper> Cork: your fiddle didnt work
[09:32:07] <superyuper> ;)
[09:32:35] <Cork> anyway use $('<div>') or document.createElement('div') (same thing)
[09:32:48] <Cork> and most importantly the text: value
[09:33:02] <Cork> that means you can't get script injected into the page through this construction
[09:33:59] <superyuper> Cork, Big thx!
[09:34:06] <Cork> np
[13:19:08] <robertparkerx> How could I disable scrolling of the window while hover inside of a container but still hover inside that container
[13:19:14] <robertparkerx> not hover scroll
[13:19:37] <robertparkerx> but still scroll inside of that container
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> that's default behavior.
[13:20:07] <robertparkerx> It doesn't do it for me
[13:20:39] <robertparkerx> once I get to the bottom or top of the fixed container it will scroll the window
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:21:02] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you want to override that behavior?
[13:21:53] <robertparkerx> They'd lose their place in the page for instance
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:22:09] <robertparkerx> the fixed container it at the bottomm and a preview of items being ordered
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> either way - what you want is possible but it's going to be a massive PITA.
[13:22:30] <robertparkerx> the pages with ads and descriptions are long at times
[13:24:00] <robertparkerx> How?
[13:24:31] <robertparkerx> can't I just do it with css and toggle a class
[13:24:33] <robertparkerx> or something
[13:25:13] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to bind a scroll listener to the document, then check to see if the scroll is happening within your scrollable container, and then check to see if the user has already scrolled to the top or bottom of the container.
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> *while also accounting for the direction of the scroll.
[13:26:17] <robertparkerx> can't I just stop it with css and toggle a body class
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> you could theoretically add/remove a class to the body, but that'll cause the scrollbar for the page to hide, which would look pretty jank.
[13:26:33] <robertparkerx> Oh
[13:37:19] <robertparkerx> $('body').bind('mousewheel touchmove', lockScroll); unbind worked
[13:40:03] <robertmaxrees> :/
[13:40:18] <robertmaxrees> why .bind() btw?
[13:44:13] <jak2000> basic question (if not want answer pls ignore me) have this Json returned (ajax request) :         {"0": "Ninguna"}  and get this error: "parsererror"      "SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected end of data at line 10 column 1 of the JSON data"      cheking Network tab in mozilla and chrome but not see any error, any advice?
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 show the code you're using for the request.
[13:46:15] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:46:17] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/1116817/
[13:46:27] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'json',
[13:46:29] <robertmaxrees> remove that.
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> you're not getting back JSON, you're getting back an object.
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> also: async: false why are you locking the browser?
[13:47:35] <jak2000> ok, copy the sample ajax request...
[13:47:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:47:53] <robertmaxrees> what sample ajax request?
[13:50:13] <jak2000> here: https://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/jQuery-AJAX-Async-False-Synchronous-call-and-Async-True-Asynchronous-call-difference.aspx
[13:50:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:50:20] <jak2000> removed both lines and get same error...
[13:50:30] <robertmaxrees> show me your new code.
[13:52:09] <jak2000> solved: i have the problem in server not flush the data... (not returned the data).
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> alright
[13:55:44] <jak2000> i checked this point because: no network data
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:58:05] <jak2000> forget.. thanks
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> ???
[15:26:19] <snackoverflow> there is a webpage from which i am trying to read text from elements inside of an iframe. i load jquery in the console because it is not automatically loaded. i use jquery to attempt to select the element, $('choice-text') as well as $('iframe').find($('.choice-text')) -- neither are working. is what I am trying to do possible?
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow yes and no
[16:03:31] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: pls elaborate
[16:03:34] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow first off, the server hosting the contents of the iframe has to allow CORS
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't, you're SOL
[16:03:47] <snackoverflow> looks like im SOL
[16:04:07] <snackoverflow> why in the hell doesnt it work
[16:04:22] <robertmaxrees> second off, you need to use https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[16:04:52] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1796621/923919
[16:04:55] <robertmaxrees> for an example
[16:09:19] <snackoverflow> oh shit it works
[16:09:23] * snackoverflow dabs like a cat
