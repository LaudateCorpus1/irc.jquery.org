[17:51:19] <_savage> When I remove() and element and all references to it are dropped (function scope closed), will the element be garbage collected?
[22:58:52] <jiffe> I have a function that recvs a list of urls it needs to make $.ajax calls for which have a success callback, is there a way to tie a response back to its original request url?
[23:04:28] <Waldkauz> Pass the response URL to the handler
[23:07:01] <jiffe> yeah I wasn't sure how to get that url but I see its available via this.url
