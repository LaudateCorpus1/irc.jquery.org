[01:38:52] <kreantos> hi, does one of you know a really lightweight overlay box "thing"
[01:39:51] <kreantos> minimum requirements would be: navigation over items
[01:50:21] <Flo0815> kreantos: jQueryUI
[01:59:39] <Bardosity> in jQuery, how do I bind the value of "this" in a function?
[02:00:05] <Bardosity> The function references "this", but I need to be able to control what "this" is
[02:00:54] <Bardosity> in moo tools I can just say myFunction.bind(whatever) and all instances of "this" in myFunction will reference whatever
[02:01:04] <imakewebthings> $.proxy
[02:01:17] <imakewebthings> is the bot working?
[02:01:18] <imakewebthings> ?proxy
[02:01:47] <Flo0815> dont understand ur question
[02:01:53] <imakewebthings> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[02:03:31] <imakewebthings> Bardosity: that's jQuery's version of bind, but obviously jQuery is adamently opposed to monkey patching native prototypes, so it's in the utility methods on the jQuery object
[02:20:49] <Bardosity> imakewebthings: Brilliant, thanks!
[02:20:58] <Bardosity> I just levelled up :)
[02:21:14] <imakewebthings> sweet, don't forget the other useful utilities on $ too
[02:21:22] <imakewebthings> map, filter, grep...
[02:29:43] <Flo0815> hey, what does this mean: type = type || "fx";
[02:31:07] <jovrtn> Flo0815: it's not jquery, but standard javascript; type would be a global variable with the value type || "fx"
[02:31:41] <Flo0815> so if type is set, type will be type, if not it will be "fx" ?
[02:31:42] <jovrtn> Flo0815: type || "fx" means that if the 'type' variable is falsy, then set the value of type to whatever is to the right of the pipes
[02:31:47] <jovrtn> right
[02:31:49] <Flo0815> ok
[02:31:50] <Flo0815> thx
[02:31:55] <jovrtn> not necessarily set
[02:32:03] <jovrtn> it could be set and falsy
[02:32:06] <Flo0815> ok
[02:34:57] <Nomikos> type might also be a passed function argument instead of global </minor detail>
[02:35:11] <Nomikos> *unspecified passed function argument
[02:36:49] <jsk143> any 1 know how to generate json file and send to the backend
[02:37:41] <Flo0815> jsk143: ajax?
[02:38:17] <Flo0815> jsk143: create an object and send it as data with the ajax request
[02:38:17] <jsk143> ya through ajax only
[02:38:39] <jovrtn> you would typically use a json library to format an object as a json string to a server-side script which would handle the file creation
[02:38:48] <jovrtn> and send to*
[02:39:13] <Flo0815> data = new Object(); data['name'] = 'xyz;
[02:39:16] <Flo0815> thats all
[02:40:06] <jsk143> k how to convert that getting data to json format
[02:40:15] <Flo0815> why json
[02:40:20] <Flo0815> just send it to the php file
[02:40:46] <Flo0815> $.ajax({url: 'handler.php', data: data});
[02:40:48] <jsk143> bcoz the communication b/w frontend and backend s only json format
[02:41:11] <Flo0815> and in the php-file u can access it like $_POST['data']['name']...
[02:42:41] <jsk143> k ill try and get back to u all..........
[02:42:53] <jsk143> thankzzzzzz a lot for every1
[02:50:26] <Flo0815> how can i access a animations queue?
[02:53:00] <sjobidoo> hi :) is it possible to animate "visibility: hidden/ visible" ? like you can with display:none/block using slide/fade ?
[02:53:34] <Flo0815> why u want to animate visibility instead of display=
[02:53:35] <Flo0815> ?
[02:53:59] <ImDom> sjobidoo, wouldnt that be the same as animating opacity?
[02:54:19] <sjobidoo> ImDom: perhaps..i wasn't sure hehe :)
[02:54:41] <sjobidoo> Flo0815: i need the elements to check their widths etc upon page load
[02:55:18] <Flo0815> u can check it when they have display: none
[02:56:09] <sjobidoo> can you get offsets aswell ?
[02:56:23] <Flo0815> i think so, try!
[02:56:32] <sjobidoo> i did..that's why i went with visibility hidden :P
[02:56:59] <sjobidoo> when i used display: none..the offsets kept returning '0'
[02:57:55] <Flo0815> hm u r right
[02:59:13] <fgro> when i'm uploading some files (post request are ongoing) and i'm trying to browse away the browser will show an "abort upload warning" message. Is there a way to customize this message with my own warning/popup with jquery/javascript?
[03:01:58] <ImDom> sjobidoo, you're right, what you could do tho is animating opacity from 1 to 0 and in the callback set it to visibility hidden so that you can get the offset and the user can click through :)
[03:02:20] <Flo0815> sjobidoo: before u check the offsets u can try to set the visibility="none", display="block", check the offsets, set the display="none" and the visibility="visible
[03:02:28] <ImDom> I don't exactly what you want to do, but that's one thing you could do
[03:02:55] <khinester> i have in-line javascript $j(".button").button(); the button links work fine on Chrome but not on Firefox
[03:03:10] <sjobidoo> thanks guys..will have a go at it :)
[03:04:05] <ImDom> khinester, DOM isn't ready maybe? :)
[03:04:38] <Flo0815> sb knows how i can access/display an animations queue?
[03:05:00] <ImDom> Flo0815, .queue()?
[03:05:08] <ImDom> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[03:05:12] <Flo0815> i only get a [] back
[03:05:21] <khinester> ImDom: is there a way to test this?
[03:05:39] <Flo0815> khinester: write it inside a document.ready
[03:06:22] <Flo0815> khinester: or if($.('.button').length() == 0) console.log('element not found');
[03:06:23] <ImDom> khinester, try $(function() {  $j(".button").button(); });
[03:06:47] <khinester> ok will try, thanks
[03:07:05] <Aamir> ?inline
[03:08:05] <Flo0815> Aamir: inside the html-document
[03:08:14] <Flo0815> and not in the <head>
[03:08:52] <khinester> this is what i have, it is for a magento theme http://pastie.org/3627054
[03:09:16] <khinester> http://shop.x11.us
[03:09:27] <quicksilver> Flo0815: .queue() is right, maybe you wre calling it on the wrong object?
[03:10:14] <Flo0815> quicksilver: if i want to animate multiple elements queued id 'myfxqueue', how do i set up this queue?
[03:11:07] <Flo0815> quicksilver: $(document.body).queue('myfxqueue', function(){ $('firstelement').animate();}); ?
[03:11:46] <quicksilver> Flo0815: why bother with a custom queue? Why not just use callbacks to handle the queueing?
[03:12:44] <Flo0815> because my animations are coming from an previously loaded xml file, so i don't know how many elements are animated
[03:13:05] <Flo0815> so i need a loop iterating over all elements stored in a variable (Object)
[03:13:28] <Flo0815> theses entries have a value "animation" where the animation parameters are in
[03:13:41] <quicksilver> you justification makes no sense.
[03:13:53] <quicksilver> using a custom queue doesn't solve that problem
[03:14:05] <Flo0815> ok so plz tell me what solves my problem
[03:14:28] <Flo0815> i'm trying since last week and i√Ñ'm going mad
[03:14:43] <quicksilver> I think mostly you need to think clearly and program your way out of the situation.
[03:14:49] <quicksilver> custom queues are completely irrelevant.
[03:14:55] <quicksilver> they don't make it any easier.
[03:15:12] <scalebyte> js method works fine for only one page https://gist.github.com/2105627 I have defined a method for checking all and unchecking all checkboxes based on a single checkbox .it works fine for one page with checkbox tag and class but doesnt for the other page which has same checkbox tag and class
[03:15:16] <quicksilver> every animation call takes a callback which you can use to set up something which happens when that part is complete
[03:15:31] <quicksilver> so you can synchronise multiple elements by using the callbacks
[03:15:45] <Flo0815> but how should i do that dynamically
[03:15:47] <Flo0815> ?
[03:15:55] <quicksilver> by programming.
[03:16:04] <quicksilver> you use variables, and your write a program which does what you want.
[03:16:26] <quicksilver> can you show an example of the kind of XML data you get?
[03:16:36] <Flo0815> sure, gimmme a sec
[03:17:31] <Flo0815> quicksilver http://jsfiddle.net/6wpbw/
[03:18:02] <Flo0815> each <config> is one element to animate
[03:18:07] <scalebyte_> js method works fine for only one page https://gist.github.com/2105627 I have defined a method for checking all and unchecking all checkboxes based on a single checkbox .it works fine for one page with checkbox tag and class but doesnt for the other page which has same checkbox tag and class
[03:19:13] <quicksilver> Flo0815: and the second is not supposed to start until the first is finished?
[03:20:24] <Flo0815> quicksilver: basically yes. I used once a plugin where u can set "scope" which is like grouping elements. So basically they are animated sequentially, if scope is set, all elements with the same scope are animated at the same time
[03:21:40] <quicksilver> Flo0815: so first you read your XML in and put the animations into an array, I suggest.
[03:21:56] <quicksilver> Flo0815: then you set the first animation, and design its callback to set the second animation
[03:22:04] <quicksilver> (and the second animations callback would set the first, etc etc)
[03:22:15] <quicksilver> erm
[03:22:19] <quicksilver> "third" I mean!
[03:23:04] <Flo0815> and how do i set the callback dynamically? sry, maybe thats a dumb question...
[03:23:37] <quicksilver> well the callback would be a function with a parameter.
[03:23:44] <quicksilver> somethign like this:
[03:23:47] <Flo0815> if i know the number of elements, $.animate(animatefirst, $.animate(animatesecond, ...
[03:24:32] <quicksilver> runAnimation ( arr, index) { $.animate( ... parameters go here ..., function() { runAnimation (arr,index+1); } }
[03:24:35] <bjensen> I am using the query date picker. In some situations, when you click on it for it to open it refreshes the entire page behind it..Its on IE8..known issue?
[03:24:48] <quicksilver> so runAnimation ( arr, 1 ) runs the first animation from the array
[03:24:59] <quicksilver> and it sets "runAnimation ( arr , 2 ) as the callback
[03:25:04] <Flo0815> hm k
[03:25:11] <quicksilver> ...and that would set runAnimation ( arr , 3 ) as the callback
[03:25:13] <quicksilver> and so on.
[03:25:13] <Flo0815> like a recursive
[03:25:19] <quicksilver> yes, it is indirectly recursive
[03:25:30] <quicksilver> obviously at some point you should check the end of the array!
[03:25:36] <Flo0815> k
[03:25:58] <Flo0815> and how can i add sth like the scope
[03:26:16] <Flo0815> if i want to animate 2 elements at the same time?
[03:31:39] <quicksilver> Flo0815: well that is more tricky because you have to attach the callback to the "slowest" animation in that scope
[03:32:07] <quicksilver> Flo0815: because you want the next step to fire once they have all finihsed == when the slowest has finished
[03:32:44] <Flo0815> so i should sort the array with animations starting with the slowest
[03:33:01] <quicksilver> withing each scope
[03:33:06] <Flo0815> yes
[03:33:21] <Flo0815> hm ok, so i'll try this
[03:33:30] <Flo0815> thx alot so far
[03:33:45] <Flo0815> stupid custom queues
[03:35:16] <impi> hey guys, im sorry if this is a n00b question, i want to know how i can find out if any element with the class="validation-failed" exists in the div id="shipping_address"
[03:35:33] <impi> i have tried this: if($j('#shipping_address .validation-failed').lenght){
[03:35:39] <impi> but getting mixed results :(
[03:35:56] <impi> length
[03:37:34] <Flo0815> quicksilver: another nooby question: is there a function like "push" for objects?
[03:37:43] <Flo0815> to add a new value?
[03:38:13] <quicksilver> how would you add a new value to an object?
[03:38:15] <quicksilver> what does that mean?
[03:38:20] <Cork> impi: if($j('#shipping_address .validation-failed').lenght > 0)
[03:39:35] <Cork> Flo0815: obj['new_key'] = 'new value'; or obj.new_key = 'new value';
[03:39:52] <Flo0815> i want an object: 0 {element: 'thisone', animationParams 'xyz'}, 1 {element: 'anotherone', animationParams 'xyz'}
[03:39:58] <quicksilver> if you mean a new property then yes, as Cork says
[03:40:07] <quicksilver> if you mean an array rather than an object
[03:40:16] <Flo0815> but i don't know the "new_key"
[03:40:33] <quicksilver> then read this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[03:40:34] <Flo0815> like .push for arrays
[03:40:48] <Cork> Flo0815: thats an array with objects in them
[03:40:53] <impi> thanks cork, this is the strange thing, even if my validation passed, jquery still tells me a .validation-failed exists, but even if i search teh html, i cant find it
[03:41:17] <Flo0815> Cork: hm k thanks
[03:41:25] <Cork> [{},{},{},{}]
[03:41:36] <Cork> impi: do you have a link?
[03:42:38] <impi> Cork i do, can i give it to you in pm?
[03:42:45] <Cork> one sec
[03:42:59] <Cork> ok
[03:47:01] <cjhmdm> hello, can anyone explain why a page I am loading using jquery removes all subsequent javascript code from the loaded page... and how to fix it?
[03:48:37] <arkascha> Problem: I need to store a reference to some object inside another dom object (a reference to one img tag inside another img tag)
[03:48:56] <arkascha> Detail: I just neeed to use the reference in jquery, I am not talking about http references r something.
[03:49:06] <arkascha> Question: how can I store such reference ?
[03:49:19] <quicksilver> jquery data perhaps, arkascha
[03:49:34] <arkascha> sure, but what do I write into ?
[03:49:47] <Flo0815> arkascha: var ref = $('element');
[03:50:07] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[03:50:09] <arkascha> that gives me 'Object' inside the data attribute.
[03:50:37] <arkascha> tried that (sllightly different, ok), I will try again.
[03:51:18] <arkascha> this is what I get inside the img tag: data-overlay="[object Object]"
[03:51:18] <DarsVaeda> hi, how do I animate to a blank backgroundColor?
[03:51:57] <Flo0815> DarsVaeda: u need a plugin to animate backgroundColor. -->http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:52:09] <Cork> DarsVaeda: uh.. blank?
[03:52:09] <Flo0815> can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used).
[03:52:15] <Cork> you mean transparent?
[03:52:28] <DarsVaeda> nah
[03:52:39] <Cork> black?
[03:53:21] <DarsVaeda> I want to highlight an element in a table row, the row itself has a hover color, so if I animate the element and then back to the original color, the hover color of the row is overwritten...get it?
[03:54:24] <DarsVaeda> so I have to remove the background-color from the element after I animated the color to get back to the original behavior
[03:56:54] <arkascha> Flo0815: quicksilver: ok, I got the idea and the stuff works. Thanks, I got that wrong in the first place.
[04:00:34] <DarsVaeda> here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/KKfCp/
[04:06:16] <AdvoWork> If im setting my class name by doing: nRow.className = aData[0];  how can i set the 2nd td instead of the whole row?
[04:08:35] <DarsVaeda> okay this works...http://jsfiddle.net/KKfCp/1/
[04:10:11] <AdvoWork> ie something like   nRow:nth-child(2) = aData[0];
[04:11:37] <Nomikos> Has anyone used the draggable helper:clone method
[04:22:18] <_ikke_> How come elem.val('test'); does not work, but elem.html('test') does?
[04:22:45] <jovrtn> depends on the kind of element
[04:22:50] <Nomikos> val() only works on input elements, html & text for .. plaintext, I guess
[04:23:47] <_ikke_> ah, right
[04:23:49] <_ikke_> silly me
[04:24:07] <_ikke_> I confused val() with text()
[04:24:58] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: you don't seem to be using jQuery
[04:25:26] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: $(nRow).find('td:(1)').attr('class',aData[0])
[04:25:28] <quicksilver> or perhaps
[04:25:43] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: $(nRow).find('td:(1)').addClass(aData[0])
[04:25:51] <quicksilver> if you want to preserve its existing classes.
[04:42:12] <cjhmdm> hello, how can I load javascript elements inside a page loaded by jquery/ajax?
[04:44:17] <cjhmdm> as of right now, I'm loading paginated pages via jquery/ajax, which all works fine and well, except the javacript (jquery mouseover) is being removed from the loaded page.
[04:44:49] <_ikke_> cjhmdm: If you are replacing existing dom-elements, atached event listeners are removed too
[04:48:32] <cjhmdm> _ikke_ not really sure to be honest.. This is what I'm using for the pagination: http://pastebin.com/hjXhfxzU When I load the initial page, the jquery mouseover works correctly (as it does if I remove the pastebin code).. and basically once you click on page 2, 3, etc the js code is completely removed from the loaded page. I can understand why and how it's happening but I can't figure out how to fix it ><
[04:53:05] <cjhmdm> _ikke_ here's the jquery function I need to maintain when the page is loaded via ajax/jquery: http://pastebin.com/06tpJsXd The code will be shortened once I work everything out, but as it stands right now, it does indeed work when the page is loaded normally.. and that entire block is remove when the page is loaded via jquery
[04:53:39] <quicksilver> its' not that the block is removed, cjhmdm
[04:53:43] <quicksilver> at least I imagine not.
[04:54:15] <quicksilver> it's just that that calls 'qtip', at page load time, on all <A> tags with the right "rel" attribute.
[04:54:22] <cjhmdm> quicksilver: it's removed entirely so far s I can tell when viewing element source on the query loaded page
[04:54:31] <quicksilver> it won't affect A tags which are loaded later.
[04:54:39] <quicksilver> nothing 'removes' javascript.
[04:54:52] <quicksilver> but javascript which is execute once at startup and does something to elements which exist then
[04:54:56] <cjhmdm> the entire block itself isn't in the page source when I load the page via query ><
[04:56:02] <quicksilver> cjhmdm: you're using jquery.load to load big chunks of HTML?
[04:56:04] <One-Man-Bucket> is it possible to stop default behaviour in IE8 with ctrl+p ?
[04:56:23] <theCole> that sounds like the shortcut to print to me
[04:57:05] <cjhmdm> quicksilver: I wouldn't call it large chunks of html.. but then that depends on what you mean by large I suppose
[04:57:38] <quicksilver> OK I don't care how big they are.
[04:57:41] <imakewebthings> quicksilver: why don't you just use event delegation, instead of trying to attach events to the elements themselves?
[04:57:53] <imakewebthings> er sorry, cjhmdm, or whoever is asking
[04:57:57] <quicksilver> imakewebthings: they aren't events.
[04:58:11] <quicksilver> cjhmdm: the point is, if you use .load with a selector, it strips scripts
[04:58:14] <quicksilver> this is documented.
[04:58:43] <quicksilver> "If .load() is called with a selector expression appended to the URL, however, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, and thus are not executed"
[04:58:43] <cjhmdm> all I'm really trying to do is have query pagination basically.. (something like how twitter used to load more tweets).. is there any way to accomplish this without it stripping my other js/jquery elements?
[04:58:47] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:58:51] <One-Man-Bucket> theCole: yes, i want to bind it to something else
[04:58:54] <cjhmdm> the initial pastebin is the only working solution I've found yet
[04:59:13] <quicksilver> you can read some discussion on how/why at this long forum thread : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/the-load-function-and-script-blocks
[05:00:01] <cjhmdm> so basically, I can't have the pagination style I want along with the mouseover function?
[05:00:34] <imakewebthings> quicksilver, cjhmdm: so we ARE talking about event handling, right?
[05:00:40] <quicksilver> imakewebthings: no.
[05:00:42] <quicksilver> imakewebthings: it's not events.
[05:00:45] <imakewebthings> he just said mouseover
[05:01:15] <quicksilver> imakewebthings: in his paste it's a call to qtip : http://pastebin.com/06tpJsXd
[05:01:24] <quicksilver> cjhmdm: of course you can.
[05:01:29] <quicksilver> cjhmdm: you jsut need to read, understand, and think.
[05:01:29] <imakewebthings> oh ok
[05:01:54] <quicksilver> if it's just a question of calling ".qtip" again I'd just do that in the ajax callback.
[05:02:24] <quicksilver> if you're deadset on calling the javascript in the loaded sections then, as that documentation says, you can do so if you don't use a selector to .load()
[05:02:41] <quicksilver> aesthetically, running script chunks from injected content feels ugly to me
[05:02:49] <quicksilver> but there are a number of things you can do to make it work.
[05:04:25] <cjhmdm> well, for the .qtip call, the only way I know how to make it work is by having a separate function call for each 'post'.. ie, if I have 15 'posts' on a page, I'd have 15 qtip elements working from qtip, qtip1, qtip2, so on and so forth .<
[05:05:46] <cjhmdm> I know it has to be the worst solution but I'm not sure how to otherwise get the needed variables from php and use them in my javascript without doing it server side
[05:07:00] <AdvoWork> is there a way I can pass something to a function, but account for nulls,such as: myfunc('test','test2') is fine, yet myfun('test','') is not, so i'd like to do: if(param = "") { param="null";} or similar, but nicer
[05:08:03] <Cork> AdvoWork: typeof(param) == 'undefined'
[05:08:07] <Cork> *===
[05:14:09] <imakewebthings> AdvoWork: If you want to test all "falsy" values you can just do if (variable)
[05:14:21] <imakewebthings> undefined, null, 0, and '' will all coerce to false
[05:14:29] <barnseenio> anyone have a suggestion to make a drop target automatically resize to fit a wider dropped item? or perhaps constrain the dropped item to the width of the drop target. screenshot of problem > http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6165047/drop_container_auto_resize.png thanks in advance
[05:34:23] <maxmc_> hi!
[05:35:05] <ImDom> maxmc_, heyoo!
[05:35:10] <maxmc_> :)
[05:36:18] <Flo0815> anyone knows how to delay a animations? $('#element').delay().animate(..) won't work
[05:36:33] <maxmc_> i'm using the jquery datepicker plugin. If I open the datepicker, close it without selecting a date and submit the form, my placeholder text "YYYY-DD-MM" is submitted. But if i leave the datepicker untouched, the field isn't submitted which is what I want if no date is selected
[05:37:23] <maxmc_> So has anyone an idea why the placeholder text is sent along with the other fields in the form even though no date was selected?
[05:38:50] <ImDom> Flo0815, you could always use setTimeout ;)
[05:39:13] <D4> Helluu, any suggestion as to how I'd "reset" the initial-scale parameter in the <meta viewport element>? Thing is, when I go from portrait > landscape the initial-scale is ignored and maximum-scale is used for some odd reason (seems to be default behavior in iPhone 3/4(GS)
[05:40:05] <Flo0815> ImDom, ya but i's very complicated. so i user this pluginhttp://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-delay-plugin/
[05:40:20] <D4> Perhaps this is more suited in jquerymobile channel, I'm not aware of the difference between the chans or in jQ ;p
[05:58:05] <Articate> When I do an .append(), will that content not be able to be handled, by say a $(".class").change()?
[05:58:17] <kevindougans> anyone got any experience with jquery ui selectable?
[05:58:35] <kevindougans> i can't find a decent guide on it anywhere, the one not he query site is too vague for a beginner like myself
[06:00:28] <gataraid> I'm not sure if it's the jquery bugging me or what but http://exactprecisions.com/WORK/PuroCleanClone/ - I cannot get the dropdown to align and work properly.  Does someone mind helping remind me of how I accompilshed this before
[06:06:52] <Articate> because it seems that anything I append is unable to be controlled via the .changed() and click() functions, etc
[06:06:59] <Articate> like the script doesn't know they exist
[06:18:21] <techouse> how do i make the $ sign usable in functions? say in a simple JS i'd use jQuery(document).ready(function($){ //happily use the $ sign instead of jQuery });
[06:18:47] <techouse> but what if i got something like function myFun() { //wanna use jQuery in here }
[06:21:06] <kevindougans> can anyone help me with this please? http://jsfiddle.net/kevindougans/J7BQx/1/
[06:21:08] <Flo0815> techouse: if u overwrite the $, use jquery with jQuery....
[06:21:11] <Flo0815> ah
[06:21:13] <Flo0815> aehm
[06:21:20] <Flo0815> jQuery.animate() for example
[06:21:23] <kevindougans> i'm trying to get the selected box value in to the input text
[06:21:30] <Flo0815> instead of $.animate()
[06:22:26] <techouse> Flo0815: i know, but i wanna make the $ "intercompatible"
[06:22:43] <techouse> and i most certainly don't wanna use jQuery.function
[06:23:07] <Flo0815> $.fn.yourfunction = function() {} ?
[06:23:53] <Flo0815> this adds a function to the "core"
[06:24:25] <techouse> ok, so instead of function myFunction() {} i should use the jQuery.fn.myFunction statement wrapped inside a (function($){blabla})(jQuery)
[06:24:43] <techouse> ok, seems reasonable
[06:24:57] <techouse> i'm just not used to adding methods instead of simple functions
[06:25:20] <techouse> cool
[06:25:20] <techouse> :)
[06:26:05] <Flo0815> be sure that it's executed at first
[06:26:27] <Flo0815> so <script>$.fn.yourfunction ....
[06:26:33] <Flo0815> then the other stuff
[06:26:59] <Flo0815> and put your other stuff inside a document.ready
[06:27:18] <Flo0815> so there will be no function call to a function, which doesn't exist yet
[06:31:12] <Articate> When I do an .append(), will that content not be able to be handled, by say a $(".class").change()?
[06:31:15] <Articate> because it seems that anything I append is unable to be controlled via the .changed() and click() functions, etc
[06:31:18] <Articate> like the script doesn't know they exist
[06:31:43] <ravenzz> ?on
[06:31:43] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:31:43] <Flo0815> Articate: if a element is added dynamically, the click handler won't work
[06:31:54] <Flo0815> thx ravenzz
[06:31:54] <Flo0815> ^^
[06:32:05] <Articate> Is there any way to remedy that, Flo?
[06:32:14] <ajpiano> Articate: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[06:32:24] <Flo0815> Articate: $('#element').on('click', function() ...
[06:34:05] <Articate> Thanks :)
[06:34:19] <charnel> I have a simple autocomplete which updates a multiple select box. I don't want user to send queries everytime they hit a key. Is it possible for me to cancel queries before or set a delay for it to be more consistent
[06:35:11] <Flo0815> charnel: save the time of the last request. if the next requestcomes too early, don't send it
[06:35:41] <charnel> Flo0815, Thanks.

[06:50:15] <VioByte>  $.getJSON('/?auth=1',{username:"' + username + '", password:"' + password + '"}, function(data) {
[06:50:45] <VioByte> can anyone tell me why that does not pass the form elements?
[06:50:59] <VioByte> err vars that is
[06:51:08] <safani> whats a great dedicated server hosting company
[06:51:36] <Flo0815> safani: qrong channel
[06:51:38] <Flo0815> *wrong
[06:51:40] <VioByte> its sends this via _GET post
[06:51:41] <VioByte> password	' + password + '  username	' + username + '
[06:51:50] <VioByte> ignore the blocks
[06:52:18] <VioByte> GET /?auth=1&username='+%2B+username+%2B+'&password='+%2B+password+%2B+
[06:52:31] <VioByte> i want it to post data including the vars values
[06:53:38] <VioByte> the jquery docs on this function (.getJSON) is not clear on how to pass values from set vars.
[06:54:08] <James13433> don't suppose anyboy knows where I can download http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie ?
[06:54:36] <johnkpaul> isn't that https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie?
[06:54:52] <jsk143> how to do for applying css style based on json id in jquery with ajax call
[06:55:01] <xec> VioByte: you can use an object literal as data
[06:55:11] <James13433> thanks johnkpaul, my Magento freind ha
[06:55:23] <johnkpaul> haha, shhh James13433, I try to hide that side of life
[06:55:33] <johnkpaul> :)
[06:55:57] <xec> VioByte: like $.getJSON(url, { message: myVar }) i believe
[06:56:16] <GreenEyes> If I wanted to do image hotspots with popup tooltips on mouse over, would I be better off using image maps, or colored divs above the image?
[06:56:35] <Xotix> hi
[06:56:40] <VioByte> xec: i think i've tried that but i'll recheck
[06:57:10] <GreenEyes> I'm just trying to understand it from a conceptual point of view
[06:58:04] <VioByte> xec: yea i have... it posts
[06:58:05] <VioByte> GET /?auth=1&username=&password=
[06:58:23] <VioByte> so anyway i try its just wont POST the data it will only GET
[06:58:26] <VioByte> :(
[06:58:39] <VioByte> it just*
[06:58:40] <Flo0815> VioByte: try $.ajax
[06:58:44] <Xotix> I have a button, if a click on that button, a cross domain post call is made to another page. actually, a normal form submit :) now, instead of getting redirected, I'd like to show the new page within an iframe. How can i do that? Or more specific, in e.g. fancybox.
[06:58:52] <xec> VioByte: what are these quotes in your code doing
[06:59:10] <ben_alman> mekwall: one thing i didn't get to fix was that the offline friends seems to constantly expand
[06:59:11] <bot-t> (6 hours 55 mins ago) <eddiemonge> tell ben_alman aro wants to know why you call yourself cowboy
[06:59:15] <ben_alman> when i don't want it to
[06:59:40] <ajpiano> VioByte: you can't POST with $.getJSOn
[06:59:42] <ajpiano> that's why it's called
[06:59:44] <ben_alman> heh
[06:59:45] <ajpiano> GET json
[06:59:53] <ben_alman> no it's get JSON
[07:00:18] <Flo0815> anyone knows how i can resume an animations which is stopped by .stop()? or a plugin i can use for that purpose?
[07:00:52] <dschuett> if i want to keep adding onto a varible in a .each function can i just use var var1 += item... ?
[07:00:57] <ben_alman> Flo0815: once an animation has been .stop()'ed you can't resume it
[07:00:57] <Nomikos> Why does draggable() stop working - visibly anyway - as soon as you add helper: clone?
[07:01:11] <VioByte> hmm so is there a .postJSON?
[07:01:14] <ben_alman> omg this channel is WAT
[07:01:25] <ben_alman> VioByte: no, but you can use $.ajax to do that
[07:01:27] <Xotix> How can i open the taget page of a form submit within an iframe or redirect it to the iframe?
[07:01:34] <ben_alman> OMG MAKE IT STOP
[07:01:40] <Flo0815> ben_alman: but if i don't clear the queue...?
[07:01:59] <Nomikos> ...
[07:02:05] <ben_alman> ?dequeue @ Flo0815
[07:02:06] <bot-t> Flo0815, .dequeue([queueName]): Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[07:02:12] <Flo0815> Xotix: $('iframe').attr('src', 'target.html'); ?
[07:02:22] <VioByte> ben_alman: ugh.. i hate having to add extra code but oh well..
[07:02:37] <Xotix> Floo0815 i need to pass post variables. form submit = post
[07:02:42] <ben_alman> VioByte: are you a programmer or what
[07:03:05] <Flo0815> Xotix: and u get html code back?
[07:03:12] <VioByte> ben_alman: i'm more of a PHP guy... just started working with jquery a week or so ago
[07:03:19] <ben_alman> VioByte: you;ll get there
[07:03:42] <ben_alman> in the mean time :P http://training.bocoup.com/comprehensive-jquery/
[07:04:02] <VioByte> ben_alman: txh'
[07:04:04] <VioByte> thx*
[07:04:15] <Xotix> Flo0815: OnClick i'd like to open an iframe and make a post call in it. or simulate it.
[07:05:34] <Flo0815> so onclick->ajax-call->put the html-code u get in a div
[07:05:35] <dschuett> I know in php you can keep concatinating a varible within a loop by using ".=" how do I achive this in jquery? I thought it was "+=", but i get an unexpected token error
[07:06:11] <ben_alman> dschuett: what are you trying to concatenate? the + operator will concatenate or add, depending on its operands
[07:06:12] <Flo0815> dschuett: it is +=, search fpr other errors
[07:07:22] <Xotix> Flo0815: No, no ajax call. Rather redirecting the post to the iframe and the iframe does it normally and loads the page. A normal form works like that: you click on submit, you get redirected to the target page and the whole thing was done via a post request. instead of getting redirected, i'd like to show it in a iframe/layer :) I'd never load content like that.
[07:07:52] <dschuett> ben_alman, Flo0815: i spoke too soon... It helps if you declare the variable outside of the loop first ;)
[07:07:58] <Flo0815> why no ajax?
[07:08:05] <Flo0815> dschuett: :D congrats
[07:09:06] <Xotix> Flo0815: Because i don't need ajax. I just want to open an layer, post some information to a different server and show a page based on these post variables within the iframe.
[07:09:29] <Flo0815> Xotix: so set the iframe-url via php
[07:09:44] <Flo0815> submit the form, php builds the iframe thats it
[07:09:58] <VioByte> well .ajax sends it but for some reason i can't parse the returning data
[07:10:12] <VioByte> It has type post and datatype json
[07:10:21] <Xotix> Flo0815: No, thats not what i meant. but thanks
[07:10:21] <VioByte> but yet success: function (data) { $.parseJSON(data), function() { alert(data);
[07:10:26] <VioByte> it never triggers the alert
[07:10:43] <Flo0815> VioByte: u need to declaard the data as JSON in ur php file
[07:10:48] <Flo0815> json_encode(array);
[07:10:53] <VioByte> it is
[07:11:00] <VioByte> unless your talking about the headers
[07:11:06] <Flo0815> and u don't need to parse it
[07:11:52] <Flo0815> success: function(data){ console.log(data)};
[07:12:43] <VioByte> ok i see
[07:13:00] <VioByte> thx
[07:18:10] <xenaxon> how do I test if jquery is activated
[07:18:25] <johnkpaul> if(window.jQuery)?
[07:19:01] <xenaxon> and then alert?
[07:19:36] <johnkpaul> then alert what?
[07:19:39] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to do?
[07:21:20] <VioByte> I love programming/scripting but when you start to mix you coding languages, it tends to make you pull your hair out or you get gray hairs.
[07:21:31] <VioByte> you coding = your coding*
[07:23:57] <johnkpaul> VioByte: you get used to it, and eventually potentially will start to enjoy it
[07:24:08] <Raverix_> VioByte: Yeah, I code in 4-5 languages every day, which is something I rather enjoy...
[07:24:26] <Raverix_> VioByte: But occasionally I'll start writing javascript in PHP :)
[07:25:13] <VioByte> well its nice when you know how to make one language able to talk to another language.
[07:25:21] <VioByte> that always brings joy.
[07:25:24] <Xotix> Can i somehow load a page into a iframe with an post request?
[07:25:27] <lericson> How do I post a <form> element as XMLHttpRequest?
[07:25:45] <johnkpaul> ?serialize @lericson
[07:25:46] <bot-t> lericson, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:25:52] <jlebrech> is there a search bar script that builds a string into the simple search for example "from:XX to:XX user:XXX subject:..."
[07:26:10] <Flo0815> is there a way to get the animations of an element?
[07:26:13] <lericson> johnkpaul: Okay, so I need to wire up the request handling and serialization manually?
[07:26:21] <jlebrech> but then also converts that to a get request string
[07:26:30] <johnkpaul> yeah, there's no .setForm() like in YUI if that's what you're expecting
[07:26:44] <johnkpaul> ?queue @Flo0815
[07:26:45] <bot-t> Flo0815, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[07:26:51] <lericson> Right, I'll have to make one then.
[07:26:54] <lericson> Thanks.
[07:26:56] <Nomikos> Is it possible, to use draggable({helper: 'clone'}), without a sortable or a droppable ?
[07:26:59] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: the queue("fx") is the animation queue
[07:27:26] <VioByte> Nomikos: i don't see why not.
[07:27:33] <xenaxon> can someone please help me
[07:27:42] <xenaxon> my jquery tabs don't seem to work
[07:27:46] <VioByte> Nomikos: oh... i read that wrong
[07:27:47] <phil-adept> afternoon all
[07:27:48] <xenaxon> I just copied the code from jquery.com
[07:27:57] <xenaxon> and it's not working like it works on their site
[07:28:04] <xenaxon> I've tried it on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/47dS9/
[07:28:13] <xenaxon> can someone take a look?
[07:28:14] <phil-adept> what's up xenanon?
[07:28:30] <VioByte> Nomikos: What do you plan on doing?
[07:29:03] <phil-adept> xenanon: For a start... Remove the <script> from teh JS panel. It's not needed. 2nd, you need to add a jquery ui css file to your resources in js fillde on teh LHS
[07:29:12] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: console.log($.('#animate_0').queue("fx")); gives me an XML filter error
[07:29:14] <Nomikos> VioByte: for starters, *understanding* it. If I do foo.draggable() it works, I can drag it. if I add {helper: clone} I don't see anything happening, but no errors either
[07:29:40] <Nomikos> VioByte: if I define a function instead of clone that returns $(this).clone() it does what I'd expect 'clone' to do
[07:30:22] <xenaxon> phil-adept: I've removed script and checked the Jquery UI checkbox on the right side
[07:30:23] <phil-adept> xenaxon: PS teh = the... I type too fast sometimes and my fingers are cold :D
[07:30:48] <phil-adept> Checking the jquery ui checkbox only loads the jquery ui JS lib's, you need to add the css
[07:30:50] <Nomikos> This must be amazingly simple and I must be amazingingly stupid, but I just can't see why that would stop doing anything without visual feedback or errors
[07:30:54] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: can you make a jsfiddle
[07:31:23] <phil-adept> Nomikos: wassup?
[07:31:26] <VioByte> Nomikos: Hmm... not sure but i think someone else here may be able to help on that.
[07:31:29] <xenaxon> phil-adept: do i need to add it manually in resources?
[07:31:34] <xenaxon> or is it already on jsfiddle
[07:31:38] <phil-adept> xenaxon: yes
[07:31:45] <VioByte> phil-adept: another drag and drop i guess :)
[07:32:02] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/kGgu3/
[07:32:20] <phil-adept> xenanon: You need to add the css resource. Don't copy the one from jqeury's demo pages either as the classes are different. You need to either host one or create on oin the jquery ui sit and paste it into your css panel
[07:32:23] <xenaxon> phil-adept:and where can I find the jquery UI css file on the internet
[07:32:39] <xenaxon> I can host one
[07:32:40] <phil-adept> xenaxon:... Let me google that for you...
[07:32:41] <quicksilver> Flo0815: That is not a jsfiddle. A jsfiddle is where you have working code and can show us the error.
[07:32:42] <xenaxon> but where do I get it
[07:32:48] <xenaxon> ok
[07:32:50] <xenaxon> i'll gg
[07:32:50] <quicksilver> Flo0815: however, just looking at your code : $.('#animate_0') looks like a typo.
[07:32:53] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: perhaps a working example?
[07:33:04] <johnkpaul> ha, but yeah, quicksilver is right
[07:33:11] <Flo0815> quicksilver, johnkpaul: gimme a sec
[07:33:13] <xenaxon> phil-adept
[07:33:18] <xenaxon> can't we just use custom css?
[07:33:18] <phil-adept> xenaxon: everything for jquery ui can be found at the jquery ui site:  http://jqueryui.com/
[07:33:29] <phil-adept> look at the theme section
[07:33:33] <xenaxon> I'm not gonna use their css anyway
[07:33:53] <phil-adept> xenanon: yes you can, however for tesdt purposes, you may as well get one off the iste to test with
[07:33:54] <Layke> What would be a good way to 1) Check that jQuery exists, 2) A specific plugin exists? Currently, I'm just doing... if(typeof jQuery != "undefined" && typeof jQuery().qtip != "undefined" )
[07:34:09] <Layke> Is that a sane way?
[07:34:11] <phil-adept> layke: That's the best way imho
[07:34:14] <Nomikos> phil-adept, VioByte: I .. have no idea. it works now. I must have been using a wrong combination of libraries
[07:34:18] <Layke> Okay cheers.
[07:34:29] <Nomikos> (... for about an hour..)
[07:34:44] <ajpiano> Layke: (window.jQuery && jQuery.fn.qtip) probably is a bit more reasonable
[07:34:45] <phil-adept> Layke: JS has no inbuilt function to test for that, so you're best off doing it that way
[07:35:05] <phil-adept> ajpiano: nice addition, thanks :D
[07:35:21] <phil-adept> ajpiano: is that as verbose?
[07:35:30] <ajpiano> clearly it isn't
[07:35:36] <Layke> It's less error suspesptible.
[07:35:39] <koulchilebaiz> hi all, i wrote a script a long time ago with some tutorials, and now i just want to add a last feature to my script (its a slideshow). how can i call the function " stop() " when mouse is over element ? here's my code : http://pastebin.com/9tYh36dW
[07:35:50] <Layke> Since you aren't checking the type of.
[07:35:55] <phil-adept> ajpiano: clearly?
[07:36:07] <Layke> I prefer ajpiano's to my solution.
[07:36:52] <ajpiano> ?eval 'typeof jQuery != "undefined" && typeof jQuery().qtip != "undefined"'.length > 'window.jQuery && jQuery.fn.qtip'.length
[07:36:56] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[07:37:03] <ajpiano> phil-adept: ^^ clearly.
[07:37:21] <johnkpaul> hahaha
[07:37:22] <martisj> what is the most efficient selector for anchor tags in two separate lists?
[07:37:29] <Layke> lol. :)
[07:37:44] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: did that work for you to get access to the queue?
[07:38:17] <martisj> Is it quicker to add a class to each of the anchor elements than to target '#list-1 a, #list-2 a' ?
[07:38:18] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: no
[07:38:33] <Flo0815> still trying to get u a workin example out of the whoile project i'm workin on
[07:39:14] <phil-adept> ajpiano: I don't fully understand that statement? Sorry, would you mind explaining for me?
[07:39:15] <Cork> martisj: yes, class is fast, and dom selectors is comparativly slow
[07:39:26] <martisj> Cork: sweet thanks :D
[07:39:28] <ajpiano> phil-adept: you know what "verbose" means, right?
[07:39:35] <martisj> that helps a great deal :D
[07:39:46] <martisj> and btw Jquery is the bomb :)
[07:39:50] <Cork> martisj: if you only selected on id's directly it would be faster
[07:40:00] <johnkpaul> martisj: I'd say that the difference is usually negligible unless you're doing hundreds of these lookups
[07:40:05] <Cork> but its most of the time not worth the extra manage of all the id's
[07:40:07] <johnkpaul> cache your jQuery selections and it should be fine
[07:40:20] <johnkpaul> if you're really worried, throw it into a jsperf and see what happens
[07:41:17] <martisj> johnkpaul: thanks :d
[07:41:24] <martisj> * :)
[07:41:27] <ajpiano> phil-adept: the test that is more than twice as many characters is obviously more verbose
[07:41:33] <martisj> I might just as well use the dom selector then.
[07:41:44] <phil-adept> ajpiano: well I've just googled it and it was a completely different definition to my understanding. I thought verbose came from verbatim lol. My bad, thanks for pointing that out :D
[07:41:51] <ajpiano> lol
[07:41:53] <martisj> I'm only selecting a maximum of 5+8 = 13 elements
[07:42:27] <phil-adept> ajpiano: Thanks, I thought I thought if something was verbose it meant 'stricter'
[07:42:27] <Cork> martisj: most of the gains is from easier code management
[07:42:38] <ajpiano> phil-adept: ah.
[07:42:46] <Cork> martisj: for speed it doesn't really matter with those numbers
[07:42:47] <martisj> Cork: using classes?
[07:42:53] <Cork> martisj: yes
[07:42:56] <martisj> ahh thanks Cork :D
[07:43:00] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: not working but i hope u understand: http://jsfiddle.net/kGgu3/1/
[07:43:36] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: you still have that extra period that quicksilver pointed out
[07:43:40] <VioByte> phil-adept: $level = ($user->userlevel() ? $user->get('level') : 'Member');
[07:43:42] <VioByte> just had to
[07:43:52] <johnkpaul> remove the . before ("#animate_0")
[07:45:08] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: ok, so now i get ["inprogress", doAnimation()], but is there a way to find out which concrete animations are on this element?
[07:45:54] <Flo0815> i need to pause animations with stop() and i want to resume them
[07:46:03] <Flo0815> so i'm building this function
[07:46:28] <phil-adept> VioByte: eh?
[07:46:29] <johnkpaul> oh, then you don't need to see which exact anoimations
[07:46:41] <Flo0815> ?
[07:46:42] <johnkpaul> ?dequeue @Flo0815
[07:46:42] <bot-t> Flo0815, .dequeue([queueName]): Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[07:46:47] <Nomikos> phil-adept: found - I was dragging an element with a background image, styled via id. the image isn't cloned so I didn't see anything happening.. see the difference: http://jsfiddle.net/KdxmE/1/
[07:46:58] <Flo0815> dequeue won't do it
[07:47:01] <Flo0815> i tried it
[07:47:15] <Nomikos> The example I was following used an older version of jQuery and there it /did/ show
[07:47:23] <johnkpaul> after a stop? dequeue doesn't continue?
[07:47:41] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: does dequeue work on css-calss-selectors?
[07:47:44] <Flo0815> *class
[07:47:49] <Flo0815> or only id's?
[07:48:25] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: doesn't matter
[07:48:26] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.dequeue
[07:49:27] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: $('#animate_0').dequeue("fx"); won't resume
[07:49:46] <Flo0815> i stop them with: $('.animated').stop();
[07:51:08] <martisj> to make a link not go act on the href is this enough: <selector>.click(function(){do_stuff(); return false;});
[07:51:08] <martisj> ?
[07:51:18] <martisj> where <selector> is a valid jq selector
[07:51:23] <Flo0815> martisj: yep
[07:51:28] <martisj> sweet
[07:51:46] <martisj> and if i want to get the href of the a being processed how would i do that?
[07:51:56] <Nomikos> VioByte: in case you're curious, found why it "didn't work", the element styled by id is cloned but without id attribute (I guess) and therefore you lose anything that id was styling
[07:52:01] <martisj> I've got $(this).attr('href')..
[07:52:02] <Flo0815> $(this).attr('href');
[07:52:05] <martisj> seems a bit clunky
[07:52:09] <Nomikos> VioByte: http://jsfiddle.net/KdxmE/1/
[07:52:11] <martisj> oh sweet :)
[07:52:13] <martisj> thanks Flo0815
[07:52:16] <Flo0815> np
[07:52:32] <phil-adept> Nomikos: In the element that you're referencing by ID, you are cloning the element however you cannot clone the ID of an alement (since you should have unique ID's throughout, so your CSS won't apply to the clone'd element as it has no ID
[07:53:00] <Nomikos> phil-adept: right, I get that now. the version of jQuery the example was using didn't know that yet
[07:53:06] <phil-adept> Nomikos: If you look at it in WDT / FB you can see what goes on when you start to drag
[07:53:23] <Nomikos> WDTFB?
[07:53:35] <Nomikos> oh, firebug, web.. somthing
[07:53:46] <phil-adept> Web Developer Tools / FireBug
[07:53:48] <xec> martisj: i think you can just do this.href
[07:54:28] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/j4SNS/
[07:54:29] <Nomikos> Lesson learned: even if you see it working, it might not actually be valid code
[07:54:39] <martisj> xec thanks
[07:54:42] <martisj> i'll give it a go
[07:54:45] <phil-adept> Nomikos: I didn't read your post, I tried it out then posted here. Sorry about repeating your solution :D
[07:54:55] <Nomikos> no matter
[07:55:16] <Nomikos> Hey, thanks for responding at all
[07:55:25] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: found that too, but this starts the animations completely new.
[07:57:00] <Flo0815> so if after 50% of the animation the stop button is pressed, and then the start button again, it will not do the remaining 50%, it will do the 100% of the animation again
[07:57:59] <johnkpaul> oh I see Flo0815
[07:59:19] <quicksilver> jquery animations can't be paused and resumed, as far as I know they simply don't store enough state for that to work
[07:59:38] <quicksilver> in the paste people have written plugins to fix that but no idea if they work with recent jquery
[07:59:52] <quicksilver> http://tobia.github.com/Pause/
[08:00:27] <Flo0815> quicksilver: hm that looks interesting... thx
[08:05:14] <Xotix> can i make a post request within an iframe?
[08:05:28] <Flo0815> Xotic: no
[08:07:25] <Flo0815> quicksilver: doesn't work ... :(
[08:07:42] <johnkpaul> well, you can use a regular form and change the target to be an iframe
[08:07:46] <johnkpaul> not necessarily with jQuery neeed

[08:08:16] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:08:21] <g0rd0n> i have a weird problem with IE9. basically, i have jqueryui tabs loading content via ajax, the content being some highcharts graphs. it works fine on Firefox and Chrome, however the graphs do not load in IE9. in the script debugger i get an error 80020101 whatever that is
[08:08:58] <DukeDrake> how can I access a local attribut? like <a data-test="abcd"> ?
[08:09:02] <johnkpaul> so quicksilver, I'd like to better understand how animations work
[08:09:08] <johnkpaul> I understand queue and dequeue and how that works
[08:09:11] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: me too
[08:09:17] <DukeDrake> $(this) ... ?
[08:09:19] <johnkpaul> but I was udner the impression that .animate() adds functions to the queue
[08:09:23] <Flo0815> DukeDrake: $(this).attr('data-test');
[08:09:30] <johnkpaul> but it seems like it adds the string "inprogres" to the queue
[08:09:49] <DukeDrake> ahh ... -.-
[08:09:56] <DukeDrake> it's gotta be monday %)
[08:10:01] <Flo0815> :)
[08:11:20] <erebel55> anyone know why i'm getting "Cannot read property 'mouse' of undefined"
[08:11:27] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/4/
[08:11:30] <erebel55> on that^
[08:13:37] <quicksilver> johnkpaul: AFAIK the 'inprogress' thing is a marker that something is currently running, but every time I want to know the details I have to read the souce.
[08:14:07] <Flo0815> quicksilver: so there's no list of animations, which are pending
[08:14:42] <quicksilver> yes, they're after teh 'inprogress' marker
[08:14:43] <quicksilver> AFAIK.
[08:15:06] <Flo0815> i've ponly seen doAnimation()
[08:15:13] <Flo0815> after the "inprogress"
[08:16:49] <Shapeshifter> Hi. So I'm trying something that may seem a bit unusual: I need a copy of the entire html tree (excluding data and even handlers but *including* <head>) , and then I want to make some changes to that copy. So I'm trying copy = $("<html>" + $("html").html() + "</html>") but that gives me a rather weird looking jquery object, and I can't do copy.html(), which I would expect to work. What am I doing wrong?
[08:17:01] <Xotix> johnkpaul: thanks but i want it the other way round but nevermind i'll do it in a bit different way. I meant making the iframe doing a post liek a form submit.
[08:17:22] <Shapeshifter> I need to be able to manipulate the copied tree.
[08:18:23] <johnkpaul> ?clone @Shapeshifter
[08:18:23] <bot-t> Shapeshifter, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:18:51] <bt9> does addClass() still add a class to an element if it's already present?
[08:19:11] <johnkpaul> quicksilver: the animate method is a beast
[08:19:49] <johnkpaul> bt9: it doesn't duplicate them if that's what you mean
[08:20:03] <bt9> johnkpaul: yes cheers
[08:20:11] <Shapeshifter> johnkpaul: ah that's interesting, cloning works now. I tried it earlier but I must have done something wrong. Thanks
[08:22:31] <johnkpaul> no problem
[08:22:33] <quicksilver> Flo0815: nope.
[08:22:37] <quicksilver> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/jTF3z/1/
[08:22:47] <quicksilver> says "number of elements in queue 5".
[08:24:04] <erebel55> am i doing something stupid?
[08:24:27] <Flo0815> quicksilver: that's all i found too
[08:24:51] <Flo0815> i think that the animations stuff is not very evolved
[08:25:21] <quicksilver> Flo0815: no, I think you do not understand it.
[08:25:33] <Flo0815> hm i hope so
[08:25:48] <quicksilver> Flo0815: you just said "i've ponly seen doAnimation() after the inprogress" and "there's no list of animations, which are pending"
[08:25:53] <Flo0815> but it's very hard to find tutorials or stuff
[08:25:59] <quicksilver> there are no tutorials for this.
[08:26:08] <quicksilver> if you want to understand queuing you have to read the source.
[08:26:09] <Flo0815> or documentation
[08:26:13] <g0rd0n> hmmm turned out i needed to downgrade to jquery 1.5.2, any more recent version doesnt work with IE9 :(
[08:26:22] <quicksilver> the documentation exists but only covers the normal way to use it
[08:26:26] <quicksilver> not how it works under the hood.
[08:26:59] <quicksilver> I don't particularly understand it either - but I read the source when I need to, to solve a problem I'm working on.
[08:27:02] <Flo0815> i know i need to learn
[08:27:21] <Flo0815> i've done not very much yet in "deeper" JS-programming
[08:29:32] <Flo0815> quicksilver: could u help me understanding qhy ur posted Pause-plugin doesn't work?
[08:29:35] <_ramo> hi
[08:29:47] <_ramo> how can i bind an event to all elements below a <li> ?
[08:30:01] <_ramo> is it $('li >') ?
[08:30:11] <_ramo> or $('li').child ?
[08:30:42] <_ramo> children() it is
[08:30:57] <kedarm> Just wanted to know if multiple calls to $(document).ready() are legit. Please comment: http://jsfiddle.net/G8QCh/3/
[08:31:24] <Larholm> kedarm, sure
[08:31:53] <kedarm> Thanks, Larholm. Are they executed in text-order?
[08:32:13] <James13433> is there any point in that though? other than code layout/clarity
[08:32:15] <Larholm> well, that's a bit of an implementation detail that you shouldn't rely on
[08:32:29] <kedarm> OK. Agree.
[08:32:42] <Larholm> but practically, yes :)
[08:33:01] <kedarm> James13433: I have extracted this code from some other place which basically is doing this.
[08:33:55] <kedarm> Under normal circumstances :-), I would rather club it in one function. But for now ...
[08:34:07] <James13433> ok fair enough
[08:35:00] <quicksilver> Flo0815: not really :) I imagine that it relies on the internals of the way jquery 1.4 worked and it's different now.
[08:35:10] <quicksilver> Flo0815: if you google for "jquery pause resume"  you will find a lot of relevant hits
[08:35:22] <quicksilver> maybe there are other animation toolkits more appropriate to what you're trying to do.
[08:35:37] <Flo0815> quicksilver: i think it's aproblem with callbacks
[08:35:41] <Flo0815> i'll try
[08:36:04] <quicksilver> well callbacks don't show in the queue if that's what you mean.
[08:36:17] <quicksilver> that's why the queue exists - it's more structured than callbacks.
[08:36:38] <Flo0815> quicksilver: that's why i wanted to use the queue
[08:36:40] <quicksilver> but non-queued callbacks run whenever their particular action (animation or AJAX) finishes
[08:43:05] <thpickert> Has there been a change in click events on <a>-elements recently either in jQuery or in browsers in general?
[08:43:26] <_ramo> what type should i choose, if i have a modal dialog with where i have the possiblity to choose between 3 options: option1, option2 and option3. if i click on a option, and POST should be done and a redirection
[08:43:26] <thpickert> Suddenly many of my plugins can't seem to prevent the default action for link clicking any more.
[08:43:55] <ender4523> i ahve 4 photos next to eachother on a page and a button below each picture that pulls down a BIO of that person.  I want it so that when one of the menus is pulled down for someone the OPACITY on the other pictures gets lower.  How can i do this with jquery
[08:44:45] <Whirl3d> when an element is :animated, is there any way to tell it's final destination parameters. I am running two animations on an element (with queue:false) and have a problem with conflicts that could be resolve by knowing the destination properties when applying the second animation..
[08:45:13] <johnkpaul> so Flo0815, I've been following the view source advice for the past few minutes, and I've gotten pretty far, jQuery.fn.animate, jQuery.fx, and jQuery.fx.prototype are the important pieces
[08:45:53] <johnkpaul> oh, I'm way behind the conversation
[08:45:53] <James13433> Is there a simple way to make the fancybox image popup link to another page?
[08:48:52] <ender4523> i want to say, if a person's bio is visible then block out the other persons pictures
[08:49:00] <ender4523> how do i set up this simple if else statement
[08:49:05] <johnkpaul> James13433: doesn't fancybox do that automatically
[08:49:10] <johnkpaul> if it's added to a link with the href of the other page
[08:49:28] <johnkpaul> the other lightbox plugin I've used does that, but I dont' remember what it's called
[08:50:28] <James13433> I don't think so one moment ill tets
[08:50:30] <James13433> test*
[08:50:43] <D4> Anyone able to tell me how I prevent my footer (with fixed position) from jumping when scrolling in iOS Safari? Really odd behavior. Anything jQ can do? :o
[08:51:12] <johnkpaul> D4: position fixed is a pain on ios pre version 5
[08:51:25] <johnkpaul> it doesn't really  mean the same thing as it does on a real desktop monitor
[08:51:28] <johnkpaul> mainly because it can't
[08:51:45] <James13433> nope johnkpaul
[08:51:47] <g0rd0n> so IE does not execute javascript contained in pages loaded via ajax since jquery 1.6, is there any reason for that and a workaround perhaps? besides sticking to 1.5.2...
[08:51:50] <johnkpaul> D4: http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/the-mobile-webkit-css-fixed-position-problem/
[08:52:37] <johnkpaul> James13433: http://fancybox.net/api advanced options
[08:52:48] <johnkpaul> type "iframe" href "your url"
[08:53:33] <James13433> Thanks johnkpaul, I think I can do it with inline, but though would be nice if there was a simplelink attribute for when its an image.
[08:53:59] <johnkpaul> yeah, I'm very surprised that there isn't
[08:57:38] <ender4523> can someone just send me somewhere that will expalin how to set up an if else statement that targets classes and IDs
[08:57:53] <ender4523> if #tom.big is visible etc
[08:58:44] <johnkpaul_> if($("#tom").is(":visible")){ //your code here }
[08:58:56] <ender4523> thx john..how do i add a class to #tom
[08:59:01] <ender4523> to make it specific
[08:59:02] <johnkpaul_> don't use #tom.big, if it's already an id, you don't need to use the class
[08:59:11] <D4> johnkpaul_ ª Interesting, the PastryKit seems outdated but iScroll 4 seems available, but that kind of requires me to redesign the entire page for it to work, as it seems to require some very specific coding to work. Anything you've worked with?
[08:59:13] <johnkpaul_> ender4523: there should only be one element with a given id on the page
[08:59:26] <ender4523> it has an ID and a class under the ID
[08:59:51] <johnkpaul> ender4523: so you want a space
[08:59:58] <ender4523> ok thanks
[09:00:28] <johnkpaul> D4: no, every time I've needed it, I've gone back to design, explained the differences, and we've found another way to handle it
[09:00:35] <johnkpaul> position fixing doesn't really make sense in the same way on a mobile device
[09:01:05] <D4> johnkpaul ª In my case it's a 'save' button that needs to scroll with the content otherwise the user has to scroll all the way down to save
[09:01:10] <Shapeshifter> I have a problem with posting a form to my server. This is the simple function http://pastie.org/3628793 If I console.log the form, I can see that everything is fine, input element inside with the value. But upon .submit() there's no POST data being sent.
[09:02:08] <johnkpaul> D4: ah I see, that's different than my usual case, where it's a information or nav bar that needs to move with the scroll
[09:02:59] <johnkpaul> D4: it would be not that complicated to implement a debounced scroll handler that checks if your button is outside of the viewport and moves it into the viewport
[09:03:04] <D4> Weird thing is it only occurs when there's "a lot" of content
[09:04:20] <Guest50962> i am new to jquery.com and I am trying to download the minified and the regular verson but when i hit download it dose not download I dont know what im doing wrong
[09:04:37] <xenaxon> do I necessarily need to place $(document).ready(function($) in the head section?
[09:04:45] <xenaxon> or can I place it somewhere in <body> ?
[09:04:46] <johnkpaul> xenaxon: no
[09:04:53] <johnkpaul> yes, you can place it inside body
[09:05:11] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: why would sb do that?
[09:05:26] <johnkpaul> sb?
[09:05:30] <johnkpaul> do what?
[09:05:38] <Guest50962> do i need to to copy and paste it in the run section ?
[09:05:46] <xenaxon> well it's not working
[09:05:47] <xenaxon> inside body
[09:05:48] <Flo0815> why would somebody put a document.rready inside the <body>
[09:06:03] <xenaxon> because I have to
[09:06:04] <xenaxon> .
[09:06:12] <Flo0815> that doesn't make sense
[09:06:20] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/07/high_performanc_5/
[09:06:34] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/Ck8vn/
[09:06:36] <xenaxon> this is my code
[09:06:44] <johnkpaul> Guest50962: what are you trying to do? what is the runs ection
[09:06:54] <xenaxon> and I'm not getting the alert
[09:07:14] <Guest50962> i am trying to download the minified and the regular version
[09:07:30] <ender4523> is this correct kohnkpaul  http://pastebin.com/0JWyDxBQ
[09:07:42] <Guest50962> and it just takes me to a page of codes
[09:07:49] <VioByte> hmm well i see .ajax sending the username and pass via json post but on the php side when i print_r the $_POST I get nothing :(
[09:07:50] <johnkpaul> so Guest50962, you're on jquery.com you clicked on download, and nothing happens?
[09:07:55] <johnkpaul> the page doesn't change to show you the source?
[09:07:59] <Guest50962> yes
[09:08:14] <Guest50962> im not sure
[09:08:15] <johnkpaul> ender4523: there is no tag called collapsed in html
[09:08:22] <Beam> yo
[09:08:22] <ender4523> its a class name
[09:08:30] <johnkpaul> then you need a period before it
[09:08:38] <ender4523> ok is the rest good?
[09:08:38] <johnkpaul> $("#tom .collapsed")
[09:08:47] <Guest50962> it  goes to a page with a bunch of codes but it dose not automatically download
[09:08:55] <Zzaichik> ^
[09:08:58] <johnkpaul> ender4523: you tell me, does it work?
[09:09:01] <ender4523> lol no
[09:09:03] <johnkpaul> Guest50962: that is the code, that is jquery
[09:09:06] <Beam> i made a custom css attribute for my own use, but i can't select it with $().css(...) in firefox and chrome, only IE?
[09:09:09] <Flo0815> Guest50962: copy the code, create a new txt-file and paste it inside
[09:09:13] <johnkpaul> you can copy and paste it or file save as
[09:09:31] <johnkpaul> ender4523: did you try with a period?
[09:09:35] <xenaxon> how can I check if jquery UI is loaded?
[09:09:37] <ender4523> yes
[09:09:39] <johnkpaul> and do you have a class in your css called opacity?
[09:09:40] <ender4523> is the IMG correct
[09:09:43] <ender4523> with no punctuation
[09:09:53] <johnkpaul> ender4523: :) I don't know, that depends on your sitauton
[09:09:58] <ender4523> just straight images
[09:10:02] <johnkpaul> there's nothing inehernetly wrong with it, but it might not be what you're tryin to do
[09:10:06] <safire> how come tables don't slide with slideToggle? they just disappear
[09:10:08] <Guest50962> after i copy and paste it then what ?
[09:10:10] <johnkpaul> setup a live example in jsfiddle and I can tell you more
[09:10:14] <ender4523> for right now im just trying to get this conditional one
[09:10:15] <ender4523> ok
[09:10:18] <ender4523> ill try
[09:10:39] <johnkpaul> ender4523: your conditional is correct syntactically and afaik, semantically
[09:11:13] <johnkpaul> xenaxon: jQuery.ui I think is the namespace
[09:11:27] <Flo0815> Guest50962: inseide ur html-document add in the head-seaction: <script type="text/javascript" src="yourscript.js">
[09:12:31] <Flo0815> the src-attribute is the path to your txt file (which u have to rename: replace the .txt with .js)
[09:12:54] <johnkpaul> xenaxon: but be careful, you can use custom builds of jQuery UI, so just becaise it's there, it doesnt' mean you have any particular wigdet
[09:13:11] <xenaxon> I've loaded it via:
[09:13:25] <xenaxon> 		wp_enqueue_script('jquery-ui-core');
[09:13:25] <xenaxon> 		wp_enqueue_script('jquery-ui-tabs');
[09:13:32] <xenaxon> and I think it's not working
[09:13:41] <xenaxon> because I'm trying to make some tabs work
[09:13:46] <xenaxon> and an accordion
[09:13:46] <johnkpaul> with wordpress, you have to make sure that your paths on the filesystem are all correct
[09:13:51] <xenaxon> and they're not working
[09:14:02] <johnkpaul> view your source and click on the links that are produced by those enqueue_script calls
[09:14:07] <johnkpaul> and see if they actually have javascript
[09:14:15] <xenaxon> nothing is produced
[09:14:20] <xenaxon> this is what is produced:
[09:14:33] <xenaxon> <link rel='stylesheet' href='http://www.wordpress.lh/wp-admin/load-styles.php?c=1&amp;dir=ltr&amp;load=admin-bar,farbtastic,wp-admin&amp;ver=81da8a3800bd351aafdff4634483df91' type='text/css' media='all' />
[09:15:10] <johnkpaul> wp_enqueue_script shouldn't add css files
[09:15:15] <xenaxon> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.wordpress.lh/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&amp;load=admin-bar,jquery-ui-core,jquery-ui-widget,jquery-ui-tabs,hoverIntent,common,jquery-color&amp;ver=99ba9303acf6794e6cb4fb8b0fbc929a'></script>
[09:15:20] <xenaxon> this, sorr
[09:15:24] <xenaxon> sorry
[09:15:27] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[09:15:30] <ender4523> johnkpaul hey it works in this jfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/WGayg/4/
[09:15:35] <xenaxon> and I can't verify
[09:15:39] <ender4523> so it must be something with the classes i am choosing
[09:15:40] <xenaxon> I've never seen such an include line
[09:15:42] <ender4523> in my website
[09:16:00] <johnkpaul> xenaxon: so it's something to do with wp and it's file system path configuration
[09:16:08] <johnkpaul> how it will find the correct js file to compile in the template dir
[09:16:16] <johnkpaul> to be honest, I don't remember, but #wordpress woudl be able to help faster
[09:16:34] <johnkpaul> ender4523: what are the classes you're choosing?
[09:16:47] <xenaxon> johnkpaul: but how can I find out if jquery is loaded and running?
[09:17:02] <johnkpaul> in your console, type window.jQuery
[09:17:08] <ender4523> its a complex site‚Ä¶ill work harder at it and if i cant find it ill come back
[09:17:16] <ender4523> thanks for helping
[09:17:26] <ender4523> taking my lunch break now
[09:17:33] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:18:35] <Flo0815> how can i get the id of an element, when i got $(this) ?
[09:18:43] <Flo0815> like inside a $.each over some elemnts
[09:18:52] <johnkpaul> this.id will do it sans jQuery wrapping
[09:18:58] <johnkpaul> or $(this).attr("id")
[09:19:23] <Flo0815> omg...sry
[09:19:28] <Flo0815> i should go home
[09:19:34] <xenaxon> function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)}
[09:19:35] <johnkpaul> :) as someone said earlier, it's a monday
[09:19:39] <xenaxon> this is what came up
[09:19:45] <johnkpaul> xenaxon: so jQuery is there
[09:19:45] <xenaxon> after typing what you said
[09:19:48] <johnkpaul> perhaps not jQuery ui
[09:19:54] <johnkpaul> but jQuery is on your page correctly
[09:20:07] <xenaxon> and how do I check if jquery ui is as well
[09:20:21] <johnkpaul> do the same thing with window.jQuery.ui
[09:20:44] <mxo> hi
[09:20:54] <xenaxon> johnkpaul: returns an object
[09:21:04] <johnkpaul> so that's there then too
[09:21:25] <xenaxon> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion'
[09:21:32] <xenaxon> also an error with my accordion
[09:21:41] <mxo> i have a problem with Split Button widget
[09:21:56] <mxo> i started to develop my own from this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#splitbutton
[09:22:42] <mxo> i need a menu with two lines and when i click on one a js function should get ajax from a service
[09:22:49] <mxo> i search on the web for tutorials
[09:23:02] <mxo> and i found this one: http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/mb/splitbutton.php
[09:23:10] <xenaxon> johnkpaul: well if jquery UI is loaded then why does it say object doesnt have method "accordion"
[09:23:18] <D4> sigh that damn iScroll 4 is NOT easy to use ;p
[09:23:26] <mxo> but i cant understand how he implements the menu
[09:23:28] <johnkpaul> because jQuery ui by itself doesn't mean that the accordion widget is there
[09:23:39] <johnkpaul> D4: :( yeah, it's not a quick fix at all
[09:23:55] <D4> lacking documentation as well
[09:24:08] <xenaxon> well jquery tabs
[09:24:10] <xenaxon> dont work either
[09:24:11] <D4> And trying in jsfiddle basically don't work either ;p
[09:24:15] <xenaxon> and they are clearly loaded
[09:24:24] <mxo> johnkpaul, i need accordion widget for my menu?
[09:24:48] <Flo0815> bye guys, thx for ur help today. see u tomorrow
[09:24:54] <johnkpaul> no mxo, I was talking to xenaxon
[09:24:58] <mxo> sorry
[09:25:10] <xenaxon> johnkpaul: I;ve loaded the jquery tabs
[09:25:16] <xenaxon> and still nothing
[09:25:52] <xenaxon> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[09:26:23] <Kit-10> BMCouto: ping
[09:26:33] <xenaxon> got it now
[09:26:37] <xenaxon> thanks allot johnkpaul
[09:26:45] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:30:03] <xlogic> Hello!
[09:31:26] <xlogic> Is it a good practice to define variables in the global namespace inside a plugin ?
[09:32:37] <walidvb> hi, can you not do img.height? do you HAVE to check the height of a surrounding div?
[09:33:41] <v_y> is there a function to post data to a url and open in a new window? i'm thinking of setting up an invisible form to achieve this but maybe it already exists?
[09:34:12] <xec> walidvb: i think you can, but you would need to do it after image is loaded
[09:34:26] <walidvb> well on domready should do it then, no?
[09:35:18] <xec> walidvb: no, try $(window).load(function(){...});
[09:36:27] <xec> walidvb: and by img.height i assume you mean something like $("img").height()
[09:36:43] <Zzaichik> unless it's a var img
[09:37:05] <walidvb> yes sorry
[09:37:12] <walidvb> i was going too fast
[09:37:15] <walidvb> it's working
[09:37:16] <walidvb> great
[09:37:18] <walidvb> thanks!
[09:37:22] <xec> yw :)
[09:37:30] <VioByte> Ok i'm posting data to a php script thats encoded via datatype: json  but when i dump the post raw data in the php script, nothing is there and i'm not sure why
[09:38:05] <VioByte> http://pastebin.com/m6THCerj
[09:38:15] <VioByte> little more details
[09:39:55] <donal> hi all, I have a string of HTML content, which I convert to to a JQuery node set using var content = $(htmlString); This node set contains an element <div id="foo"></div> I want to add the content <div id="bar"></div> as a sibling of the div with id foo
[09:44:44] <VioByte> donal: content = $(htmlString).find('#foo').append('#bar'); <--- just a guess.
[09:45:12] <panchot> content = find('#foo').prepend('<div id="bar"></div>');
[09:45:23] <panchot> the same as VioByte
[09:46:57] <donal> thanks for the suggestions
[09:59:27] <ender4523> johnkpaul you there?
[09:59:33] <johnkpaul> yeah what's up
[09:59:46] <ender4523> so remember our problem earlier‚Ä¶the css i want to detect is inline
[09:59:54] <ender4523> how can i check if an inline css is visible or not
[10:00:09] <johnkpaul> .is(":visible") checks the current state of the elemtn
[10:00:15] <johnkpaul> so it doesnt' matter if it's inline
[10:00:18] <johnkpaul> ?:visible
[10:00:19] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[10:00:57] <ender4523> so if i have <div id="tom" class="collapse" style="display:none"> then both tom and collapse are display none right?
[10:01:43] <johnkpaul> #tom is
[10:01:47] <johnkpaul> .collapse might not all be
[10:01:59] <johnkpaul> there could be multiple elements with the class collapse on your page
[10:02:27] <ender4523> when i use firebug it shows that element.style is overriding collapse.  IE the diplay:none is being taken from the element style.
[10:02:36] <ender4523> when I reference tom or collapse its not working
[10:02:36] <lukebrannon> i've got a weird issue where it looks like I have one javascript walking over another, but when I fire up a script debugger (firebug for instance) the "trampled" script starts to work‚Ä¶  any idea what would cause that?
[10:03:04] <johnkpaul> ender4523: inline style always overrides
[10:03:26] <ender4523> so the if else statement wont show that .collapse is display none then?
[10:03:47] <johnkpaul> it depends, there are multiple .collapse's potentially
[10:03:52] <johnkpaul> have to head out but will get backt o you later
[10:03:56] <ender4523> well than what about #tom‚Ä¶that wont work either
[10:04:32] <ender4523> ill try and figure it out
[10:08:30] <VioByte> data: 'data={"username":"' + username + '", "password":"' + password + '"}',
[10:08:31] <VioByte> Array
[10:08:31] <VioByte> (
[10:08:31] <VioByte>     [data] => {"username":"dsa", "password":"dsa"}
[10:08:31] <VioByte> )
[10:08:33] <VioByte> there
[10:08:50] <VioByte> shows how to send data via post where php will actually see it under $_POST
[10:09:01] <VioByte> with ajax via json encoding
[10:09:36] <VioByte> then you just json_decode it on the php side and you've got yourself a nice flow
[10:18:04] <ender4523> johnkpaul  should this be in my .click function because i want it to happen when they click the button.  but it seems that it doesnt work when I move the javascript there
[10:19:10] <Bartzy> I don't know if an element is currently hidden or not. I want to be sure it's hidden. Is there any downside of just doing $('#elem').hide(), and not $('#elem').filter(':visible').hide(); ?
[10:19:29] <_ramo> hey
[10:19:40] <ender4523> good question bartzy
[10:19:52] <_ramo> can i have in a modal dialog three independent buttons, that have different ajax calls?
[10:20:01] <Bartzy> .hide() checks if the element is already hidden and doesn't do anything, or it forcefully hides anyway? And if it hides anyway - any downsides anyway?
[10:20:33] <ender4523> johnkpaul i figured it out.  i had a return statement higher up in the javascript
[10:21:16] <subdesign> hi, anyone know a simplereach jquery alternative?
[10:21:25] <Bartzy> ender4523: Any answer? :)
[10:21:42] <ender4523> lol i have no idea‚Ä¶i just know its a good question
[10:23:16] <lahwran> function rcol(){return '#'+(0x1000000+(Math.random())*0xffffff).toString(16).substr(1,6)};function f(){$("*").each(function(index){this.style.backgroundColor=rcol();});window.setTimeout(f, 1000);}f();
[10:23:22] <erichynds> Bartzy: no, it doesn't check first
[10:23:27] <lahwran> ^ boredom alleviator
[10:23:39] <poppiez> I have a hard time dealing with multiple requests. imagine google maps, when panning stops, zooming ends etc. I fetch a list of polygons for that viewport and draw then (ie. replace the current polygons). what if I pan, fetch, pan around, and then fetch? how do I make sure the initial fetch doesn't draw now that I've moved on?
[10:23:44] <johnkpaul> ender4523: that's great, glad you figured it out
[10:23:45] <Bartzy> erichynds: So a better way would be to do $('#elem').filter(':visible').hide()?
[10:23:55] <Bartzy> erichynds: Or it really doesn't matter if it "rehides" an already hidden element ?
[10:24:03] <ender4523> thanks‚Ä¶now i have like 5 other problems lol but at least im making progress
[10:24:05] <johnkpaul> Bartzy: there's no downside to hiding all of them, the time it takes to filter would take away the optimization
[10:24:32] <johnkpaul> it doesn't matter if it rehides an already hidden element, if display:none is already there, there'll be no reflow/paint
[10:24:47] <Bartzy> johnkpaul: Yeah, I didn't talk about the time it takes to filter, but more about the "reflow" or whatever if you set display:none to an element. But if it's already display:none that nothing really happens right ?
[10:24:57] <Bartzy> johnkpaul: Well, you just answered. Thanks!
[10:25:19] <Bartzy> What is the difference between reflow and paint, BTW ?
[10:28:00] <johnkpaul> reflow is the layout
[10:28:03] <johnkpaul> repaint is the exact graphics/colors
[10:28:24] <akahn> Is it possible to unbind an event from within an event handler? Is there something in the event object that handlers get passed that would allow that?
[10:28:57] <johnkpaul> I mean, in general terms, for more details http://www.phpied.com/rendering-repaint-reflowrelayout-restyle/
[10:29:01] <ender4523> how do I change a css property with jquery
[10:29:03] <johnkpaul> Bartzy: that's for you
[10:29:18] <anli_> Is there a way to check if the browser will perform well using canvas?
[10:29:18] <johnkpaul> ender4523: $("li").css("color","red")
[10:29:23] <ender4523> thx
[10:29:29] <Bartzy> johnkpaul: Thank you very much.
[10:29:29] <johnkpaul> anli_: use modernizer
[10:29:36] <johnkpaul> no problem Bartzy, have fun
[10:31:33] <pifantastic> akahn: does this help? http://api.jquery.com/one/
[10:32:02] <johnkpaul> akahn: do you want to unbind the event completely?
[10:32:04] <akahn> pifantastic: I may have to end up using that.
[10:32:09] <johnkpaul> if so, you can just add $(this).unbind("event_name")
[10:32:11] <johnkpaul> in your callback
[10:32:44] <akahn> hm, yeah, but then since this is bound using delegation, that'll unbind it for all the siblings of this element
[10:33:27] <johnkpaul> no akahn, "this" should be bound to the particular dom element
[10:33:42] <akahn> but there isn't an event bound to it directly, since I'm using delegate
[10:35:11] <johnkpaul> ah, so then jquery.fn.off, although I don't know the parameters for that very well
[10:36:53] <akahn> basically i have a list of links that do something, and one of them doesn't do the same thing, but actually loads more of those links
[10:37:03] <ender4523> what does $(this).attr("href") give me?
[10:37:11] <erichynds> Bartzy: it doesn't really matter. using a :visible filter is way more expensive
[10:38:14] <johnkpaul> akahn: does that extra link have a special class or something?
[10:38:23] <akahn> yes
[10:38:25] <johnkpaul> I'm pretty sure that delegate selectors will understand :not
[10:38:39] <johnkpaul> so then you don't need to add the event to that element at all
[10:39:09] <akahn> the idea was I could handle all of it within one event handler. but that doesn't actually seem like a very good idea, and I'll probably do what pifantastic is suggesting
[10:39:52] <johnkpaul> ah I see
[10:40:03] <ShaunR> I currently do this to clear out all inputs on a form, but i also want to clear radios, checks, textareas, etc... anybody have a trick up there sleeve?   $(this).find('input').val('');
[10:42:31] <johnkpaul> ShaunR: form.reset()?
[10:44:14] <xmaddness> ShaunR, I'd probably do womething like $(':input', form).each and check what each type is or tag name is. Do stuff for each tag ot type
[10:44:59] <xmaddness> Of course that is if the form.reset isn't sufficient for some reason
[10:45:31] <rroelofs> ShaunR:  if your needs are simple, $(":input").val("") might work.
[10:46:06] <xmaddness> That will kill hiddens though
[10:46:11] <xmaddness> so be aware of that
[10:46:17] <rroelofs> exactly
[10:46:56] <anli_> Is there a way to never have the firefox error console in the alt-tab list?
[10:47:00] <anli_> I hate to switch to that window
[10:47:14] <johnkpaul> I think that jquery is going to complicate it, form.reset() will handle all of the edge cases
[10:47:21] <johnkpaul> and return the form to the state it was in when the page first loaded
[10:47:41] <donal> <anli_> you can open firebug in a new window
[10:47:41] <johnkpaul> anli_: do you not use firebug? you can dock that to the bottom of the window
[10:47:57] <donal> It will then appear in the alt-tab list
[10:48:15] <anli_> I use firebug, but I also want to use the error console
[10:48:28] <anli_> However, I never want to switch to that window using alt-tab
[10:49:34] <donal> If I have the following node set var nodes = $('<div id="foo"><div id="bar"></div></div>') how can I append "<div id='baz'></div>" as the first child of foo ?
[10:50:07] <johnkpaul> nodes.prepend("")
[10:50:24] <johnkpaul> @nd
[10:50:29] <johnkpaul> @donal
[10:58:43] <Bartzy> erichynds: Yeah, got it. Any other way of doing :visible, which is better (in performance) , BTW ?
[10:59:20] <erebel55> does anyone understand why i'm getting a "cannot read property 'mouse' of undefined" in this jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/4/
[10:59:30] <erichynds> Bartzy: you'd have to perf test this, but $("div").filter(function() { return $.css(this, "display") !== "visible"; });
[11:05:02] <ShaunR> k so then is reset() the function so i do ('#form').reset()?
[11:05:08] <smares> when writing a plugin that interacts with children of a selected element, what is the best way to select those children?
[11:05:15] <smares> $('dt', this)?
[11:09:21] <kristofer91> Hey guys, can anyone explain to me why when i go onto my page
[11:09:29] <kristofer91> i have an accordion
[11:09:46] <kristofer91> but you can see it load the java instead of being loaded on loading of the page
[11:10:02] <kristofer91> Is it because i add it in the header ?
[11:10:04] <kristofer91> or what
[11:10:59] <MeowthThatsRight> hey  I  was wondering if there's a way of removing an event listening to a class that was made by another plugin.
[11:11:28] <MeowthThatsRight> ie. I change the id and the text of an element but i want to remove the event listener of the object that was associated previously.
[11:14:00] <ender4523> can anyone expalin why the opacity on this code isnt working
[11:14:01] <ender4523> http://pastebin.com/07qKj59t
[11:14:17] <ender4523> when the menu fades in I want all the pages to go back to their original opacity but nothing is happening
[11:17:45] <Zzaichik> For starters you can go $('#wrap1, #wrap2, #wrap3, #wrap4').css();   ..I think. And you should probably be using .animate() instead of .css() to get the proper effect you're looking for.
[11:18:52] <ender4523> ok thx
[11:25:08] <Kit-10> MeowthThatsRight: why not replace the item with a clone?
[11:26:10] <MeowthThatsRight> Kit-10, although I forget my original question I was able to get it to work, I simply $.removeClass() and $.removeAttr('class');  and that worked.
[11:26:42] <MeowthThatsRight> Kit-10, I appreciate the help though :)
[11:26:50] <Kit-10> MeowthThatsRight: var item =$(item); item.replaceWith(item.clone().attr('id', 'X'));
[11:27:18] <Kit-10> hmm no worries
[11:27:32] <MeowthThatsRight> one line == better than two thanks I'll use that for future references :D
[11:27:48] <MeowthThatsRight> efficient coding techniques are much better than less efficient ones
[11:28:08] <Kit-10> MeowthThatsRight: sometimes more explicit code is better
[11:28:32] <ender4523> zzaichik i changed it do condense it like u said and it messed things up
[11:28:37] <Kit-10> eg 1 line is not always better than 2  .. especially when it comes to checking in the future
[11:28:51] <ender4523> nvm
[11:28:52] <ender4523> ur right
[11:28:55] <ender4523> i messsed it up
[11:29:25] <Zzaichik> haha - okay
[11:29:39] <ender4523> thannk boychik
[11:32:59] <GhostCat> Hi everyone, I'm trying to get an inline onmouseover="$('.myclass').not(this).attr('class', 'newclass');" into a function definition, can someone help me?
[11:33:00] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to determine the final property values of an animation? If not, would it be reasonable to override the $.fn.animate() function to store the dest properties in the data object associated with the "animated element?
[11:35:03] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: you mean while the animation is happening?
[11:35:11] <Whirl3d> yep
[11:35:18] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply.
[11:36:38] <Whirl3d> In other words, I have one method that scales the object to fit within a div (animating it's width/height) and then another method that changes it's position to center it on another object. It works great except that the size affects the position.
[11:37:00] <johnkpaul> so you can definitely add a callback to _after_ the animation is finished
[11:37:05] <Kit-10> GhostCat: var items = $('.myclass'); items.on('mouseenter', function() { items.not(this).addClass('newclass'); });
[11:37:20] <martisj> is there a way i can prevent popups from being blocked?
[11:37:33] <Zzaichik> yikes
[11:37:44] <Kit-10> martisj: is there any way you can stop people visiting your site?
[11:37:48] <martisj> i have two functions that show a poppup for logging in to facebook. one of them is being blocked while the other isn't.
[11:37:49] <Whirl3d> then the animation would go like: Item shrinks/expands then moves over. It needs to shrink/expand/move all at once
[11:38:05] <martisj> Kit-10: i can think of many :D
[11:38:21] <Kit-10> martisj: in most cases, it's not the popup
[11:38:27] <Kit-10> but how it's triggered
[11:38:39] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: queue:false?
[11:38:47] <Whirl3d> So I figure I will rewrite $.fn.animate to store the destination parameters in  elements data object.
[11:38:47] <johnkpaul> so you have two animations
[11:38:51] <Kit-10> martisj: any chance instead of a popup using a lightbox with an iframe?
[11:38:51] <johnkpaul> that you want to run at the exact same time
[11:38:52] <martisj> Kit-10: hmmm... could you elaborate?
[11:38:53] <johnkpaul> right?
[11:38:53] <GhostCat> Kit-10, the problem is there is no "this" to reference
[11:38:58] <Whirl3d> Queue:false works for the concurrent animations
[11:39:08] <martisj> it's part of facebook standard JS SDK.
[11:39:08] <Kit-10> GhostCat: sure there is,.. in an event
[11:39:34] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hg3jK/33/
[11:39:36] <martisj> Kit-10: I am using the same function twice, well at least almost the same.
[11:40:04] <Whirl3d> I need to change the draggable div's color to make it easier to see. brb
[11:40:51] <epaloids> hello I wanted to have an ajax submit once the select box is chosen how will I do that with jquery
[11:40:57] <epaloids> I have the partial code already
[11:41:14] <johnkpaul> oh I see Whirl3d
[11:42:03] <GhostCat> Kit-10, Is doing it with an "items" variable as efficient and elegant as it can be done?  It seems like a redeclaration?
[11:42:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hg3jK/36/     a ittle better
[11:42:21] <johnkpaul> so you need to share {width:destw, height:desth} with centerTo?
[11:42:23] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: ?
[11:43:48] <burg> hello. how can i track drag event on jquery mobile?
[11:43:54] <Whirl3d> yeah. But to make it fair, it needs to be autonomous...in other words, it can't have an explicit relationship or it makes it inflexible. I think if I store the dest parameters in the data object and then before sizing or moving, I check if :animated and if so, take the data parameters into consideration...
[11:44:18] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so then make your own custom event
[11:44:22] <raj`> how do I find all consecutive elements with a class within a node?
[11:44:30] <raj`> brothers/sisters
[11:44:38] <martisj> Kit-10: how can i make sure a popup is triggered correctly?
[11:44:39] <johnkpaul> ?siblings @raj`
[11:44:39] <bot-t> raj`, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[11:45:05] <raj`> great, thank you
[11:46:20] <raj`> johnkpaul, what if I want all siblings of a class, btwn two classes?
[11:46:27] <raj`> is that only done by index?
[11:46:34] <johnkpaul> so Whirl3d, inside jQuery.fx.prootype, there are low level functions that can get you the animated properties
[11:46:51] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/acarr/jQuery-Animating-Event/blob/master/jq.event.animating.js might help @Whirl3d
[11:47:00] <johnkpaul> raj`: what do you mean btwn two classes?
[11:47:01] <raj`> [A
[11:47:49] <raj> i have two elements, and i wanna collect only the siblings (div elements at the same level) btwn them in html
[11:48:15] <johnkpaul> oh
[11:48:21] <johnkpaul> perhaps call next() recusrively
[11:48:28] <johnkpaul> until you reach the second element
[11:48:39] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks for the link. I'll check it out.
[11:49:05] <johnkpaul> np
[11:49:56] <badbandit> can anyone recommend a good, clean photogallery plugin that is simliar to galleryview?
[11:50:05] <badbandit> for use on a news website
[11:50:06] <raj> johnkpaul, so <div class="ok"/><div class="hi"/><div class="ok"/><div class="ok"><div class="bye"/> would collect the hi, bye, and two okays in btwn hi and bye divs
[11:50:33] <johnkpaul> raj: there's nothing ootb in jQuery that will do that for you
[11:50:48] <raj> johnkpaul, what's wrong with next?
[11:50:57] <raj> it'll find the next sibling
[11:51:02] <johnkpaul> nothing is wrong with next, but that doesn't get every next singling
[11:51:06] <raj> and then i can keep calling it till a certain class is reached?
[11:51:14] <raj> yeah
[11:51:17] <raj> it's inefficient i guess
[11:51:19] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's fine
[11:51:21] <raj> johnkpaul, so what abou tindex?
[11:51:25] <johnkpaul> no, I wasn't saying that's bad
[11:51:26] <raj> i mean, index
[11:51:33] <johnkpaul> I was saying that the function you're describing needs to be written
[11:51:35] <johnkpaul> it's not already in jquery
[11:51:39] <raj> oh
[11:51:41] <johnkpaul> I would use .next() recursively
[11:51:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Hg3jK/40/
[11:51:48] <raj> k
[11:52:14] <Whirl3d> just wondering why I'm not able to access animate through $.fn.oldAnimate()....what am I doing wrong...
[11:54:44] <Whirl3d> actually, nvm, I can do it manually in each method...duh!
[11:56:46] <raj> johnkpaul, nextUntil()
[11:58:11] <kenthree> I want to call a function when any ajax starts, and another when that ajax ends. what's the smartest way? is ajaxSetup what i'm looking for?
[11:58:59] <kenthree> because I think that's only to change dafaults which is not what I need
[12:00:39] <NoiseEee> kenthree: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ etc
[12:02:47] <kenthree> NoiseEee: thanks
[12:07:36] <martisj> trying to show a popup on when a user clicks a link gets blocked by chromes poopup blocker.
[12:07:53] <martisj> Is there a "good" way to show popups?
[12:08:12] <martisj> I loath popups, but it's the best option for logging in to facebook via the js sdk.
[12:08:18] <daxroc> martisj: you have to allow them
[12:08:55] <martisj> daxroc: not by default.
[12:09:08] <martisj> some of the popups on the page work but one specific doesn't
[12:09:10] <martisj> wtf.
[12:09:32] <daxroc> I don't think you can load an external popup with out user interaction?
[12:10:01] <nebmo> hi, I've put a Nivo Slider (nivo.dev7studios.com) script in my homepage www.s-express.co (its a taxi website). Sometimes it does not load the scrolling images and just comes up with blank area. I would have to refresh to make it work. any ideas how to make it work everytime?
[12:10:35] <johnkpaul> raj: awesome
[12:10:40] <johnkpaul> glad to see it's already there
[12:10:48] <johnkpaul> and it doesn't use .next() recurseively
[12:15:03] <martisj> daxroc: I'm not trying to do it without user interaction.
[12:15:41] <martisj> daxroc: when a user clicks on a link my script calls getloginstatus from the facebook js sdk and then if user isn't logged in show popup else go to page.
[12:16:32] <daxroc> martisj: never used fb js sdk sorry
[12:21:02] <Gates> I have an image, image.png
[12:21:13] <Gates> and upon hover i'd like it to change to, image_hover.png
[12:21:28] <Gates> and of course on removal of the hover to remove the '_hover'
[12:21:33] <Gates> var src = $(this).attr("src").match(/[^\.]+/) + "_hover.png";
[12:21:44] <Gates> yet i think i am doing something wrong because I am over writting the entire src
[12:21:45] <Gates> any ideas?
[12:22:29] <smares> if I have an ul for example with lots of li elements... how can I add a class to a clicked element and ensure that only that element has the class? :)
[12:22:46] <smares> so to denote an "active" list element for example
[12:23:25] <smares> simply do $('li.active').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active') in a click event?

[12:31:43] <johnkpaul> shan: I dont' see any question from you
[12:32:27] <shan> actually im begineer , i want to know how i can change the jquery script path from jquery.. ?
[12:33:30] <shan>  i want to know how i can change the jquery script path from jquery.. ?
[12:33:44] <shan> johnkpaul :  i want to know how i can change the jquery script path from jquery.. ?
[12:34:04] <johnkpaul> what is the "jquery script path"?
[12:34:04] <nnn> johnkpaul: well, from inside the script tag? :P i mean.. i'm calling the floater function from a .animate complete function which is inside $(document).ready.. the function is called because i checked it with an alert and it did alert.. actually.. if i do.. $('#floater').animate......css('display','none'); then the element does hides itself.. but the animation doesn't occurs. :/
[12:34:57] <nnn> shan: yeah, what is "jquery script path"?
[12:35:25] <nnn> shan: if you're asking how to link it in your page then go to the jquery homepage.. it'll help you :)
[12:35:28] <johnkpaul> nnn: animate is async
[12:35:35] <johnkpaul> your css is hiding it before the animation is finihse
[12:35:37] <johnkpaul> finished*
[12:36:17] <shan> johnkpaul : actually im using jquery in asp.net , using in user control and other page , when page is load the user control in that page also load both have same relative path , so both they donot work due to change if reference file path
[12:36:26] <nnn> johnkpaul:umm.. well.. i added the css thing just to check if the jquery is working inside the function.. the css thing is not there anymore.. the animation is still not being done :/
[12:36:40] <shan> script path is : ../scripts/jquery-1.6.2.min.js
[12:36:50] <nnn> johnkpaul:wait wait wait.. i think i know what wrong.. i'll brb.
[12:37:20] <foo> Correct me if I'm wrong, but jquery can't be used in e-mail, right? eg.  you can have like drop down sections in an e-mail format, right?
[12:37:39] <Zzaichik> email's = 90's style websites
[12:37:56] <Zzaichik> So no, you can't.
[12:37:59] <foo> ok
[12:38:50] <johnkpaul> shan: I don't really know anything about asp.net, I think this is more of an asp question
[12:38:51] <shan> ?
[12:39:00] <johnkpaul> I don't know how you specify paths
[12:39:03] <johnkpaul> in .net
[12:39:12] <Gates> How do I add jquery easing for this? => http://pastebin.com/2iq7JsUL
[12:39:17] <foo> Zzaichik: happen to know about printing e-mails and control there? I might just google for that one. eg. can we have separate print css for e-mail? probably depends on client

[12:39:45] <Zzaichik> I don't think so. You can't have an external anything
[12:39:45] <shan> ok thanks :) posted in forums may anyone help me there...
[12:39:52] <Gates> is it just in the function
[12:39:53] <foo> Zzaichik: good point, thanks
[12:39:59] <foo> johnkpaul: thanks, I should have just googled
[12:40:06] <johnkpaul> np
[12:40:19] <Gates> Zzaichik: any idea?
[12:40:27] <Zzaichik> huh?
[12:40:29] <nnn> johnkpaul: thanks for the async tip ;) i got it to work ;)
[12:40:37] <johnkpaul> awesome
[12:40:37] <Zzaichik> guess I'll go look...
[12:43:57] <Zzaichik> yes
[12:44:24] <Zzaichik> I would think so. In the mousing function sounds good.

[12:59:41] <_bart> Hi, why is this .getJSON request for JSONP failing: http://www.zekerleuk.nl/test.php
[13:03:48] <monk12> blah, im trying to uppercase the first letter of a input: http://jsfiddle.net/MWdc4/
[13:03:51] <_Nike_> I've $$('input[name=senha]').each(function(e){ <<< I need check "name=senha and disables != disabled"   how do ?
[13:03:58] <monk12> not sure why the original text not getting into that function
[13:04:27] <monk12> and text1/text2 can't get the text there either
[13:04:39] <ngharo> _bart: specify the jsonpCallback option if you're not letting jquery automagically do it
[13:06:04] <_bart> ngharo: I've changed the code, but it still is not responding: http://www.zekerleuk.nl/test.php
[13:06:38] <_bart> ngharo: setting jsonZekerLeukApi as callback instead of ? doesn't work either
[13:06:42] <ngharo> _bart: now it's because your server side isn't using the supplied callback GET arg
[13:07:08] <_Nike_> anyone can help me?
[13:07:35] <monk12> whats up _N
[13:07:39] <monk12> _Nike_^
[13:07:45] <_bart> ngharo: what should the server side script use it for?
[13:08:08] <_bart> ngharo: I mean, the jsonp response is already correct, I rolled that myself, no GET arguments are required for this one.
[13:08:43] <ngharo> _bart: the server side should wrap the response inside the callback GET argument it gets
[13:09:04] <ngharo> callback=? makes jquery automagically create a function name that maps to your success callback of getJSON
[13:09:17] <ngharo> you can see this in the network tab of your developer tools

[13:12:42] <monk12> _Nike_, "I'll past", what does that mean?
[13:13:45] <_Nike_> see: http://pastebin.com/35qUUDp3  is possible in line: $$('input[name=email]').each(function(e){   check if "disables!=disabled" too ?

[13:15:30] <ngharo> _bart: http://jsfiddle.net/B4Yhv/
[13:17:00] <_bart> ngharo: thanks alot! It seems so simple.
[13:17:52] <_Nike_> my problem isn't simple xD
[13:19:36] <ngharo> _Nike_: .not(':disabled')
[13:20:13] <_Nike_> ngharo where can I put this ?
[13:20:18] <_Nike_> sorry
[13:20:21] <_Nike_> I'm newbie in jquery
[13:20:47] <ngharo> what is $$
[13:20:50] <anli_> jquery-1.7.1 seems to give me this error: Use of getAttributeNode() is deprecated. Use getAttribute() instead.
[13:20:52] <ngharo> am i looking at prototype.js
[13:21:06] <anli_> (well, warning)
[13:21:20] <anli_> Is jquery using deprecated functions?
[13:21:59] <Schumacher> hey guys, ive got a little problem.. I want to get all selects which have a value selected(not the default one).
[13:22:05] <Schumacher> i got this : jQuery.each($("select.option").find(":selected")), function() {
[13:22:30] <Schumacher> and i get all the selects, but can't seem to find out how to exclude the once with value = "ingen"
[13:23:14] <dmsuperman> .filter
[13:23:25] <dmsuperman> or rather in your case, .not
[13:24:14] <Schumacher> ive tried to use the .not, but then it said that .val() is not a object, so how should i check up agianst it ?
[13:24:28] <highmay> Hello everybody
[13:24:38] <highmay> im going my crazy
[13:25:10] <highmay> if someone can help with a json query
[13:25:12] <dmsuperman> Schumacher: use the .not right inline where you build the selector
[13:25:18] <dmsuperman> Schumacher: so you iterate over the result of .not
[13:25:29] <dmsuperman> then you won't get elements which don't match the filter
[13:25:37] <highmay> speak me in private and i send you the query
[13:26:31] <ngharo> ?p @ highmay
[13:26:31] <bot-t> highmay, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:26:58] <Schumacher> dmsuperman, can you give an example ? :/.. because in every way i try it, it dosn't work :p
[13:28:56] <Schumacher> $("select.option").find(":selected").val().not("ingen")
[13:29:06] <dmsuperman> that's not how .not works
[13:29:18] <dmsuperman> .find(':selected').not('[value=ingen]')
[13:29:53] <Schumacher> ahh.. Stupid me ! ‚Ä¶
[13:30:10] <Schumacher> forgot all about getting the value in that way :p
[13:30:17] <dmsuperman> ;)
[13:30:48] <Schumacher> works like a charm ! thx ..
[13:30:56] <dmsuperman> np
[13:32:05] <igcewieling> I'm a jquery n00b.  Is this correct to get the value= of the selected item? $('#route_edit select[name="type"]').val()
[13:32:35] <igcewieling> I just checking because the results I get are impossible and want to make sure I didn't screw up the selector.
[13:32:42] <dmsuperman> That will find the .val() of the select whose name is type, inside the node #route_edit
[13:32:47] <dmsuperman> I think jquery resolves that to the selected option
[13:33:39] <dmsuperman> Indeed it does, as per http://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:33:44] <igcewieling> dmsuperman: that's what I thought.  Thanks.  I must have something else messed up.  That is returning a value which does not exist.
[13:33:48] <kenthree> igcewieling: you can type that line straight into the chrome console and see what it gives
[13:33:59] <_Nike_> .not(':disabled') don't working
[13:35:13] <dmsuperman> works just fine here _Nike_
[13:35:36] <Chopps> does anyone here know how to limit the input of a text field to positive integers only and integers from 0 to 100?
[13:35:43] <dmsuperman> $('button').length // 2        $('button').not(':disabled').length  // 1
[13:35:46] <dmsuperman> on this page: http://api.jquery.com/disabled-selector/
[13:35:52] <dmsuperman> which has 1 disabled and 1 non-disabled button
[13:36:06] <NoiseEee> Chopps: you don't limit it, you check it/validate it before submission
[13:36:39] <kenthree> Chopps: one way would be grabbing the value on .blur and resetting it if it's "wrong"
[13:38:24] <Chopps> i understand, i think i will only limit the field to accept only positive integers and validate on submit, thank you guys :D
[13:44:09] <ender4523> 	$('.expand').css("background-image", "url(..images/arrow-red-up-small.png)")
[13:44:15] <ender4523> why isnt this line of code working to change the background
[13:45:50] <highmay> ngharo:  bot-t  is already copied http://jsfiddle.net/qadBp/
[13:46:19] <highmay> i put in the html part the result of the console
[13:47:04] <highmay> what i want i just one record in the json but i got all the registry
[13:47:14] <ender4523> is there anything wrong with my statement: 	$('.expand').css("background-image", "url(..images/arrow-red-up-small.png)")
[13:47:15] <highmay> (sorry for my english)
[13:47:27] <yedimind> ender4523, its backgroundImage iirc
[13:47:32] <yedimind> not background-image
[13:47:36] <ender4523> thanks
[13:47:58] <ender4523> what does iirc mean
[13:48:34] <ngharo> highmay: you only want the data where ref="001" ?
[13:49:14] <ender4523> yedimind its not working
[13:49:24] <yedimind> iirc = if i remember correctly
[13:49:31] <ender4523> ill see if i can finf di
[13:49:34] <ender4523> find it*
[13:50:07] <NoiseEee> ender4523: try $('.expand').css({backgroundImage:"url(..images/arrow-red-up-small.png)"})
[13:50:11] <yedimind> its definitely background-image
[13:50:15] <NoiseEee> you're using .css incorrectly
[13:50:20] <ender4523> ok
[13:50:45] <yedimind> ender4523, also, i would image your url is ../images
[13:50:47] <yedimind> not ..images/
[13:50:52] <yedimind> thats probably your problem
[13:50:53] <phrozen> hello, I have a question. I have a form <form><table id="form1"></table><table id="form2"></table></form> and in tables inputs. How to prepare a handler in jQuery which first show message with options yes / no and if yes then it check a checkbox in form which is in this.table ?
[13:51:09] <ngharo> .css('foo', 'bar') and .css({foo: 'bar'}) are the same
[13:51:09] <NoiseEee> phrozen: nest forms are illegalz.
[13:51:11] <yedimind> phrozen, using tables for forms is generally bad practice
[13:51:17] <yedimind> and use fieldsets
[13:51:20] <yedimind> and labels
[13:51:30] <yedimind> but you also cant nest forms
[13:51:39] <phrozen> yedimind: but I have to use table in this project
[13:51:54] <phrozen> for school.
[13:51:59] <yedimind> go to a different school.
[13:52:06] <phrozen> I prepared a bit of code but I am not sure is it good
[13:52:15] <yedimind> if they're teaching you this shit, then you're not getting your educations' worth
[13:52:30] <yedimind> anyway, i digress
[13:52:48] <phrozen> yedimind: cannot ;]
[13:53:34] <highmay> yes ngharo i want all the data with that reference
[13:54:11] <ngharo> highmay: typically you'd filter that server side and return only what you want
[13:54:56] <ender4523> so yedimin, it is background-image, however its not showing my picture‚Ä¶just making the old picture dissapear
[13:55:15] <ngharo> highmay: but in your case, you can just do something like if(property.ref != '001') continue;
[13:55:30] <NoiseEee> ender4523: then your path is likely wrong. debug.
[13:57:38] <yedimind> ender4523, look at your URL
[13:57:41] <yedimind> its ..images
[13:57:44] <ender4523> i changed that
[13:57:44] <yedimind> instead of ../images
[13:57:49] <ender4523> still not working
[13:57:55] <yedimind> you'll need to provide a test case, because "not working" doesnt really help us
[13:57:57] <yedimind> in debugging anything
[13:58:05] <yedimind> so setup a jsfiddle and paste the url and we can take a look
[13:58:14] <yedimind> use something like dummyimage.com so you dont have to upload your images
[13:58:18] <ender4523> ok
[14:00:32] <ender4523> got the problem
[14:00:36] <ender4523> i dont need the 2 dots before images
[14:01:47] <ender4523> not only that but doing it this way you have to link up to images‚Ä¶it doesnt go from where ur css is
[14:03:16] <ender4523> thats weird
[14:03:19] <ender4523> not sure why it does that
[14:03:51] <dmsuperman> ender4523: relative paths are always from the location of the CSS document
[14:04:25] <yedimind> dmsuperman, nope, not when you're setting css with jquery
[14:04:35] <yedimind> because that's inline in the html docuemnt, and therefore relative to the location of the html document
[14:04:52] <ender4523> yedimind is there a way to get around this?
[14:05:08] <yedimind> yeah, set a base path in your html document
[14:05:22] <ender4523> ok
[14:05:23] <yedimind> <base>
[14:05:32] <dmsuperman> yedimind: which means that "the location of the CSS document" is the current page
[14:05:34] <yedimind> also, just understand how folders work is important here
[14:05:37] <dmsuperman> so what I said remains true
[14:05:57] <yedimind> dmsuperman, its a little ambiguous because it's no in fact the CSS document
[14:05:59] <yedimind> its the HTML document
[14:06:04] <yedimind> that happens to have inline CSS
[14:06:17] <yedimind> im not trying to be argumentative either, was just explaining what you said further
[14:06:20] <yedimind> no need to get defensive
[14:06:22] <dmsuperman> it's irrelevant where the source is. The path is relative to the source :-/
[14:06:45] <dmsuperman> just becuase the page is both HTML and CSS doesn't make it ambiguous or different. I'm just pointing out that saying it's "different" when it isn't is confusing
[14:06:52] <dmsuperman> to people who don't get why it might be important
[14:06:57] <yedimind> we're in agreeance, all i'm saying is that your nomenclature could ge tconfusing to people who dont understand
[14:07:14] <yedimind> but whatever dude, again, no need to get defensive
[14:07:29] <dmsuperman> I'm saying exactly that of your nomenclature. There's nothing defensive about correcting something
[14:07:36] <dmsuperman> seems like you needs ome of your own medicine :P
[14:07:54] <yedimind> sure
[14:08:08] <yedimind> moving on? :)
[14:08:16] <dmsuperman> already did a while ago
[14:11:45] <Advocated> i've got a dialog to open on hover of an icon, this works well, i repeat the process from another icon, before i open the dialogs i close all dialogs, but if i open one, then the other, its showing the 2nd dialog underneath the other one and making the page scroll down?
[14:12:53] <raj> Whirl3d, were we talking about the selector yesterday?

[14:16:19] <ngharo> raj: works for me, chrome 18
[14:16:34] <raj> how can that be
[14:16:43] <raj> i'm 18 also
[14:16:57] <raj> Error in even thandler for 'undefined': undefined
[14:17:21] <raj> click on the 'hi's on the right, and then ctrl+click one and you'll see the error
[14:17:27] <Whirl3d> raj, what were you asking?
[14:17:43] <raj> were we discussing this functionality yesterday?
[14:17:55] <Whirl3d> yup
[14:18:12] <raj> oh ok, yeah, thank you for showing me how to setup my variables in a useful way
[14:18:31] <raj> made everyhting much easier after that
[14:18:55] <ngharo> raj: http://i.imgur.com/peiUV.png
[14:19:06] <raj> but yeah, i'm getting an error and not really able to troubleshoot where it's coming from
[14:19:25] <Whirl3d> do you have a fiddle setup?
[14:19:54] <raj> yeah
[14:20:03] <raj> it's hte one you're looking at
[14:20:08] <raj> i don't understand how this is happening
[14:20:12] <raj> how can I get the error and you not?
[14:20:27] <ngharo> raj: perhaps reload the page, maybe you got some jsfiddle fallout
[14:20:53] <nFFF> dont name your variables with $ :<
[14:21:34] <nFFF> I dont think you have the functionality  you want when you hold shift?
[14:25:43] <Whirl3d> raj, what fiddle number are you on? I was last on 77, but I noticed that the numbers go past 90...
[14:25:53] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from jquerymobile: PSA - don't use a jQuery Mobile 1.0.x theme with 1.1 JS. When 1.1 final releases, we'll support that in ThemeRoller w/upgrade tool too ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/FQ7XzP

[14:26:49] <raj> Whirl3d, 131
[14:27:17] <raj> nFFF, I was working on shift's functionality when I realized an error started showing up with ctrl
[14:27:52] <raj> but but i'm pretty sure i didn't get that error when I "thought" i finished ctrl
[14:27:58] <rroelofs> raj: on a mac you can't control click
[14:28:06] <raj> i hope someone else is seeing the error too
[14:28:07] <ngharo> Ha HA!
[14:28:12] <raj> rroelofs, for mac i'm gonna use modifier
[14:28:20] <Whirl3d> no error with control here
[14:28:28] <raj> what the hell
[14:29:10] <ngharo> Do not try to solve the error.  That's impossible.  Instead realize the truth -- there is no error.
[14:29:21] * ngharo giggles
[14:29:23] <rroelofs> raj:  you want meta.  works for both
[14:30:11] <rroelofs> maps to ctrl on win, cmd on mac

[14:33:22] <disappearedng> Hey I have this query $('#users > li.filler[display!=none]') somehow it is returning li.fillers that have display:none
[14:33:43] <rroelofs> I switched else if (e.ctrlKey) for else if (e.metaKey) and it works fine for me too
[14:34:26] <raj> omg
[14:34:27] <yedimind> disappearedng, try using :visible
[14:34:38] <yedimind> also, keep in mind that only applies to whenever it is that you initialize the script
[14:34:47] <rroelofs> raj:  I think it is one of your chrome extensions
[14:35:10] <raj> oh, yes
[14:35:17] <raj> it must be the dictionary thing
[14:35:22] <raj> good clal rroelofs
[14:35:24] <raj> *call
[14:35:53] <raj> yup, that was it
[14:35:56] <raj> thank you
[14:37:01] <badbandit> can anyone recommend a robust, clean jquery photo gallery?
[14:37:56] <rroelofs> disappearedng: that is the behavior I would expect.  wht are you looking for?
[14:38:16] <disappearedng> Ok so basically I need some advise rroelofs
[14:38:38] <disappearedng> I am creating a game, and my game needs 3 people to start
[14:39:01] <disappearedng> so right now there are these placeholder entries that when a user start a game he/she will see them being there
[14:39:23] <disappearedng> and if another person joins, they will just be replaced with the actual user entries
[14:39:30] <disappearedng> what's a good way to do this?
[14:40:20] <rroelofs> what does the html look like  are the display hidden elements children of li.filler?
[14:40:23] <disappearedng> I need 2 operations: total displaying fillers and total displaying non fillers
[14:40:50] <rroelofs> making a fiddle will help us help you
[14:41:29] <rroelofs> and more than half the time I discover my mistake while prepping the fiddle
[14:41:37] <raj> is there an opposite of nextUntil?
[14:42:00] <rroelofs> prevUntil
[14:42:21] <disappearedng> http://jsfiddle.net/JWSrY/ rroelofs
[14:42:51] <raj> thanks rroelofs
[14:42:56] <disappearedng> the thing is I am not able to get jquery selector != working correctly.
[14:43:08] <disappearedng> I even tried "display"!="none" and it's not working
[14:43:55] <xp_prg2> anyone use jquery notify here?
[14:43:56] <raj> rroelofs, when you multiselect on a mac, is it the metaKey you normally use?
[14:44:08] <raj> and is the metaKey the apple key or the ctrl key?
[14:44:30] <rroelofs> raj; on mac it is apple key, on win it is ctrl key
[14:44:49] <raj> and applekey is how you normally multiselect things?
[14:45:28] <rroelofs> disappearedng: if you want to select descendants of li.filler that are display: none,  $("li.filler :hidden")
[14:45:37] <rroelofs> raj: yes
[14:46:57] <disappearedng> no descendants
[14:47:13] <disappearedng> wait
[14:47:15] <disappearedng> what about non hidden?
[14:47:53] <rroelofs> $("li.filler :visible")
[14:48:12] <disappearedng> OH you save my life
[14:48:35] <rroelofs> check out http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/jquery-selector-extensions/
[14:49:26] <newcode> how would you guys go for creating a class with static methods using jquery ?
[14:50:09] <rroelofs> newcode: I'm not sure I understand the benefit
[14:50:45] <Woet> does someone know a minimalistic modern table layout?
[14:50:51] <Woet> kinda like http://themeforest.net/item/akili-landing-page-for-hosting-company/full_screen_preview/1822857 but vertical instead of horizontally
[14:51:06] <disappearedng> is it also possible to query for all li without the class "filler"?
[14:51:17] <rroelofs> of course
[14:51:46] <newcode> rroelofs: I would like to have a class like myApp which has a bunch of static methods so I could call them from anywhere doing: $('whatever').hover(myApp.expandMenu());
[14:52:20] <benji_> Hey, what kind of tool you guys use to create mock-ups for the company (need to be nimble, easily moved rearranged live)?
[14:52:22] <rroelofs> that will work just fine, but 'this' will not be the class
[14:52:39] <newcode> rroelofs: not sure it's the way jquery is intended to work
[14:52:46] <raj> rroelofs, using metaKey breaks the code
[14:52:53] <raj> it no longer multiselects, not sure why
[14:53:53] <rroelofs> newcode: jquery doesn't care at al about code organization.  Do what makes sense to you.  Make sure you understand what jquery is doing to you can work productively
[14:54:17] <rroelofs> raj:  did you replace all instances of ctrlKey with metaKey?
[14:54:23] <raj> yes
[14:54:35] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/135/
[14:54:56] <newcode> rroelofs: yes, I am kinda new to jquery, coming from OOP php, I'm a bit confused. I just want my code to be clean and well organized
[14:55:23] <newcode> rroelofs: do you know of any blog where I could learn mode about what I want to do
[14:55:24] <newcode> ?
[14:55:59] <rroelofs> raj:  works for me :-)
[14:56:14] <teadict> heya nerds, is there wilcards for selectors?
[14:56:24] <raj> rroelofs, does ctrlKey work as your Control button?
[14:56:26] <teadict> kinda need dynamic binding of handlers to stuff
[14:57:12] <raj> oh, rroelofs cuz if it does, then I'll just have to check for OS
[14:57:27] <rroelofs> newcode:  For large projects i recommend backbone.  It helps with code organization and uses jQuery for dom manipulation
[14:57:40] <teadict> oh right, attr^=xxxxx
[14:57:52] <newcode> rroelofs: I have heard of it, thanks - I will take a look at it
[14:58:26] <rroelofs> raj:  I'm not sure I know wht you mean.  on a mac holding down the ctrl key is like right clicking
[14:58:43] <raj> really?
[14:58:49] <rroelofs> you get a context menu
[14:58:51] <rroelofs> yes
[14:58:52] <raj> ok, so is e.ctrlKey useless on a mac?
[14:59:17] <rroelofs> yes
[14:59:21] <raj> good
[14:59:53] <phuff> Anybody up for a qunit question? :)
[15:00:06] <disappearedng> raj are you from colorado
[15:00:07] <raj> and also, would if a ctrl+shift is pressed, would it match `if (e.ctrl){}` ?
[15:00:11] <raj> disappearedng, no
[15:00:16] <rroelofs> gtg
[15:00:20] <disappearedng> oh I have another friend whose nick is also raj sorry
[15:00:33] <disappearedng> is there a way to query for elements that do NOT have a particular class?
[15:00:35] <raj> gotcha
[15:00:41] <Eviltwin> disappearedng: see ?not
[15:00:42] <bot-t> disappearedng, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:00:42] <raj> .not()
[15:00:52] <Eviltwin> disappearedng: Or see ?:not
[15:00:52] <bot-t> disappearedng, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[15:01:16] <disappearedng> wow I really love jquery
[15:01:18] <Eviltwin> But the former is faster if it fitsyour criteria
[15:01:40] <phuff> I have some html on which I can call css('left') and get a reasonable value in prod, but when I put the html inside the qunit fixture it doesn't work.
[15:02:30] <wiwillia> can you run a jquery operation, like .children("a") on a DOM element without a jquery selector?  so foo = getElementByID("bar"); foo.children("a").hide()?
[15:02:46] <Eviltwin> phuff: If I recall correctly, accessing properties like .css("left") actually uses other properties to get the left position in pixels
[15:02:58] <Eviltwin> Properties that are 0 if the element isn't in the page and visible
[15:03:18] <Eviltwin> wiwillia: You turn the DOM element into a jQuery object by wrapping it with $()
[15:03:23] <Eviltwin> $(foo).children("a").hide()
[15:03:38] <Eviltwin> This is documented here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[15:03:49] <wiwillia> can you string a dom element Eviltwin?  So $(foo + " a").hide()?
[15:04:39] <Eviltwin> That would produce something like $("[object HTMLDivElement] a")
[15:04:49] <Eviltwin> Which obviously won't work
[15:04:56] <Eviltwin> Elements aren't strings
[15:05:01] <wiwillia> alright I'll read up on it
[15:05:11] <Eviltwin> And don't necessarily have a simple selector that's unique to them
[15:05:39] <Eviltwin> You use selectors to find elements, but it's not always trivial to do the reverse
[15:06:03] <wiwillia> Thanks Eviltwin, trying to figure it all out
[15:06:09] <phuff> Eviltwin: I moved it back into position and still couldn't get it to respond with a sane value
[15:06:18] <phuff> Eviltwin: but that's what I was assuming. :(
[15:06:30] <phuff> Trying to test if some animation works.
[15:06:44] <raj> can I do this? var selected_list = $targ.nextUntil('now-selected') || $targ.prevUntil('now-selected'); selected_list.each().addClass('selected');
[15:06:50] <Eviltwin> If you want to assert that the left property is set to a particular value, I'd suggest using [0].style.left or something like that
[15:07:04] <Eviltwin> raj: It'll always return the first one
[15:07:13] <raj> oh
[15:07:44] <raj> so .each(i, elem){$(elem).addClass('selected')
[15:08:07] <Eviltwin> I was ttalking about your first part
[15:08:10] <Eviltwin> With the ||
[15:08:16] <Eviltwin> That won't do what you want it to do
[15:08:21] <raj> oh
[15:08:41] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2svSU/19/
[15:08:47] <Eviltwin> The second part is a misunderstanding on your part about when you need .each()
[15:08:50] <Whirl3d> Raj, that might be closer
[15:09:02] <Eviltwin> selected_list.addClass("selected") will add it to each item in that collection
[15:09:28] <raj> Whirl3d, haha, I'm trying to avoid your fancy math :P
[15:09:37] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Try selecting something near the bottom and shift selecting up
[15:09:37] <Whirl3d> fancy math?
[15:09:39] <raj> Eviltwin, that's what I want
[15:09:53] <raj> Whirl3d, you're using indexes and whatnot
[15:09:59] <raj> i was seeing if I could do it without
[15:10:46] <raj> i thought nextUntil and prevUntil would allow for that
[15:10:58] <raj> Whirl3d, only cuz the code is more concise
[15:10:59] <Whirl3d> eviltwin, missed one line, thx:  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2svSU/20/
[15:11:12] <Eviltwin> raj: You're misunderstanding what the || will do in this situation
[15:11:36] <Whirl3d> I made my code drawn out for your benefit so you could see what's up with it. It works.
[15:12:08] <raj> Eviltwin, I was hoping if 'now-selected' doesn't show up in any of the next elements, it'll return false
[15:12:50] <Eviltwin> raj: That's not even close to what it does...
[15:13:01] <Eviltwin> raj: see ?nextUntil see ?prevUntil
[15:13:01] <bot-t> raj, .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[15:13:01] <bot-t> raj, .prevUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[15:13:04] <Eviltwin> RTFM
[15:13:09] <raj> Whirl3d, i know it works, i learned a lot from it actually...just trying to do the shift selection without index
[15:13:33] <raj> Eviltwin, ? i read the fucking manual
[15:13:43] <raj> i know it's not including the item including that item
[15:13:56] <raj> *i know it's up to and not including that item
[15:13:57] <Eviltwin> Where the fuck did you get "it'll return false" from?
[15:14:03] <raj> but that's a small thing to fix
[15:14:04] <Eviltwin> It's not in the manual, I can promise you that
[15:14:36] <raj> but how can it try going up to that item if that item isn't there
[15:14:43] <raj> anyway
[15:14:47] <raj> what's the correct way to do that then?
[15:14:54] <Eviltwin> It explains the behavior right there...
[15:15:13] <Eviltwin> "If the selector is not matched or is not supplied, ..."
[15:15:15] <walidvb> would womeone ming giving me a very quick hand in regexp?
[15:15:15] <raj> see if $('.selected') in each list
[15:15:22] <raj> prevlist and nextlist
[15:15:36] <raj> sorry, i mean see if $('.now-selected') is in each of those lists
[15:15:42] <walidvb> i'm trying to match gif|jpg|jpeg and i have this: \w*\.(jpeg)|(gif)
[15:15:48] <walidvb> not working..
[15:16:30] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: You want (jpeg|gif)
[15:16:38] <Eviltwin> Err, walidvb
[15:16:40] <Eviltwin> That was for you
[15:16:57] <walidvb> Eviltwin: thanks. i think i tried that but let me try again
[15:17:15] <walidvb> apparently not :) thanks!
[15:17:27] <imsky> zoop zap ziba di bap
[15:23:07] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin is it possible to use .sortable (from jqueryUI) with selection?
[15:25:27] <walidvb> \join java
[15:25:42] <Eviltwin> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/EthJP/
[15:26:02] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I think so. I don't use jQuery UI too often myself
[15:26:48] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, your example doesn't shift-deselect correctly
[15:26:58] <Whirl3d> though it is beautfiul in comparison
[15:27:07] <Eviltwin> Actually it has another bug I didn't realize
[15:27:16] <nFFF> sure is a lot easier to read then anything else posted
[15:27:50] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What would you consider the right behavior?
[15:28:15] <nFFF> to block deselect
[15:28:26] <nFFF> when shift is holded, you have the first block select right
[15:28:43] <nFFF> but if you try to hold shift and click another element, it should deselect all elements in between
[15:28:46] <Eviltwin> Well yeah but you can do things like Apple/Ctrl deselect items in the list after a block select
[15:28:46] <Whirl3d> I, personally, expect that if you shift-deselect an item, it deselects evertyhing between your last click and that click
[15:29:32] <Whirl3d> right, which is how your shift-deselect is working now
[15:30:42] <Whirl3d> But I like the notion that selecting one at the top and one at the bottom and shift-selecting in the middle selects the range. Never thought of doing something like that
[15:31:38] <Eviltwin> Go ahead and play around with it. Different OSes actually select a little differently.
[15:31:44] <Eviltwin> I think I have most of the useful pieces in place there
[15:32:04] <raj> what's wrong wiht my selected_list function when shift selecting? http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/140/
[15:32:23] <Eviltwin> li is the one that was just clicked, last is the one that was clicked without a modifier
[15:32:47] <nFFF> Raj, delete your code and replace it with Eviltwin, its almost impossible to read yours
[15:32:56] <raj> really?
[15:33:06] <raj> my whole purpose was additional readability
[15:33:10] <raj> crap
[15:33:12] <nFFF> I mean you even name your variables beginning with $
[15:33:16] <nFFF> lol raj
[15:33:18] <raj> so?
[15:33:20] <nFFF> serious or joke?
[15:33:24] <raj> serious
[15:33:27] <raj> what's wrong with $
[15:33:28] <raj> ?
[15:33:34] <raj> it's a jquery element
[15:33:36] <Eviltwin> nFFF: It's not an uncommon practice to use $ at the beginning to indicate that it's a jQuery collection
[15:33:39] <raj> so i named it accordingly
[15:33:44] <Eviltwin> But there's nothing that says you have to do that
[15:33:47] <Eviltwin> It's a question of preference
[15:33:58] <nFFF> It makes the code so ugly
[15:34:01] <raj> yeah, i prefer, cuz then i remember i do'nt need to throw it in $()
[15:34:02] <nFFF> looks like PHP
[15:34:32] <raj> anyway, what else is unreadable?
[15:35:24] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, can you explain the prevAll and nextAll lines. I know what the method does, but how are your using it?
[15:35:36] <ajpiano> ?$prefix @ nFFF
[15:35:36] <bot-t> nFFF, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[15:36:03] <oojacoboo> hey, how do I get the every other index with js?  is it something like i%2?
[15:36:05] <dougb> Can anyone help me with this issue? I can't seem to work with elements where the names are referenced in variables http://www.programmingnotepad.com/p/8fTcK
[15:36:21] <nFFF> ajpiano, it's just so ugly, and makes the code harder to follow imo
[15:36:22] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: So prevAll gets all preceeding siblings and the .is is testing whether the element in the var last is in that collection
[15:36:26] <Whirl3d> wait, are you using .is as a selector? I gotta look that up. I thought it returned true/false
[15:36:33] <raj> ok, so why am I getting an Uncaught Typeerror with shift selecting here http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/140/ ? is it cuz I can't see if a jquery object is in next_list/prev_list?
[15:36:35] <Whirl3d> oh, pfew
[15:36:40] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: So basically testing whether or not the last element is before li or not
[15:36:53] <Eviltwin> After is the same except with nextAll instead
[15:37:45] <Eviltwin> You could probably use a third class to indicate the last click of any kind which might be useful for undoing the previous selection and then applying the new one
[15:37:48] <Eviltwin> IDK
[15:38:02] <Eviltwin> I was also trying to support individual additionals and removals on top
[15:38:18] <Eviltwin> But there are different philosophies on how a shift-select after an apple/ctrl select should work
[15:39:34] <Eviltwin> All stuff you can play with
[15:39:37] <Eviltwin> The important pieces are there
[15:39:58] <joaojeronimo> Guys, how can I access the cookies set by the server ? I can only access the cookies that I set with jquery (using the cookies plugin).
[15:40:19] <confounds> joaojeronimo shouldn't matter, a cookie's a cookie
[15:41:06] <joaojeronimo> confounds: But they just don't appear in "document.cookie"... I can see them with Chrome's F12 webmaster tools under Resources -> Cookies...
[15:41:07] <ajpiano> nFFF: "imo" being the operative phrase
[15:41:15] <ajpiano> it's a completely subjective them
[15:41:16] <ajpiano> thing*
[15:41:47] <Eviltwin> Some people object to the idea of using $ as a variable name
[15:41:55] <Eviltwin> But jQuery and many other libraries do it
[15:42:00] <raj> any ideas?
[15:42:03] <confounds> joaojeronimo you need the name of the cookie
[15:42:07] <confounds> google around a bit :)
[15:42:14] <Eviltwin> raj: I think Whirl3d's looking at it. You can too
[15:42:22] <raj> ?
[15:42:28] <raj> you think i'm not looking at my own code?
[15:42:47] <nFFF> ajpiano, also I don't really see it used much by experienced developers, so I presumed most frowned upon the style, but I shall not be so quick to condem in the future
[15:43:14] <Eviltwin> raj: I'm starting to get the feeling that you don't really understand jQuery and its relation to JavaScript
[15:43:27] <joaojeronimo> confounds: The name of the cookie appears in resources -> cookies, then I try to view it with "$.cookie('name')" and it comes undefined... and document.cookie yields the names and the values but not of the ones set by the server...
[15:44:08] <raj> i thought maybe this was invalid--> if($('.now-selected') in $(e.target).nextUntil('now-selected'){alert('hi')})
[15:44:42] <Eviltwin> Well it's not an error but again it's not doing what you think it does
[15:44:49] <Eviltwin> The biggest problem is that you're trying to call .each on a function
[15:44:51] <phuff> Thanks for the help, Eviltwin.
[15:44:53] <phuff> I appreciate it.
[15:45:02] <Eviltwin> And functions don't have a .each
[15:45:16] <confounds> joaojeronimo not sure, i know there must be a lot available online about it though
[15:45:46] <joaojeronimo> confounds: ok, I'll try to find something. Thanks anyway
[15:45:57] <Eviltwin> raj: What you're displaying here I call a "dangerous" level of knowledge
[15:46:07] <Eviltwin> You know some of the building blocks you have available but don't really know what they do
[15:46:13] <Eviltwin> So you just try putting things together
[15:46:35] <Eviltwin> And as soon as there isn't an error, you declare, "Done!" and come running to us asking why it doesn't work.
[15:46:50] <raj> Eviltwin, so stop complaining and explain what I'm doing wrong
[15:46:53] <raj> i'd appreciate that
[15:46:55] <raj> that's why I'm here
[15:47:07] <Eviltwin> What you're doing wrong is not bothering to learn JavaScript and jQuery
[15:47:09] <raj> can I not iterate through the list?
[15:47:10] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ raj
[15:47:11] <bot-t> raj, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:47:13] <raj> i mean, array
[15:47:24] <raj> jesus christ you are annoying
[15:47:41] <receipts> hello
[15:47:50] <Eviltwin> You have several problems and I've been trying to point them out to you
[15:47:58] <raj> no, you haven't
[15:48:04] <Eviltwin> The error you are getting is because you are calling .each a property of a jQuery object on a function
[15:48:14] <raj> you've been complaining about my code, without being explicit where my thinking faulters
[15:48:28] <raj> i'm obviously confusing where I can use a jquery object, or something along those lines
[15:48:32] <receipts> I tried asking a question on the jquery forum last week but didn't get a response. I was hoping someone could help me with a simple usage of the Cycle plugin please? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/cycle-plugin-using-pager-events
[15:48:43] <raj> i was under the impression that next_list and prev_list were arrays of the jquery objects
[15:48:45] <Eviltwin> raj: The problem is I don't think you know what a jQuery object is
[15:48:46] <Shapeshifter> How can I send a copy of the browser's html to the server? I can get a good copy by doing h = $("html").clone(false, false).html(), but I'm not sure how to send it to the server. Doing a POST with such a big argument seems wrong. How would I do a put? Do I need to encode it (h) somehow?
[15:48:58] <Eviltwin> I have a feeling that if you did, you would be making a lot fewer mistakes
[15:48:59] <raj> and then i was trying to see if a particular jquery object matched an item that array
[15:49:04] <raj> *an item in that array
[15:49:09] <Eviltwin> But rather than trying to learn, you seem to want us to just fix the bug in the code
[15:49:24] <raj> no, i would rather learn what i'm doing wrong
[15:49:30] <raj> i'm familiar with what a jquery object is
[15:49:36] <Eviltwin> Okay, what is it?
[15:49:39] <raj> but if I'm lacking somewhere, please indulge me
[15:49:46] <raj> don't even bother fixing my code, I'd rather understand how to fish
[15:50:11] <raj> it's a dom object with additional properties that I can access to get more info about the element
[15:50:26] <Eviltwin> There's no such thing as a "DOM object"
[15:50:30] <Eviltwin> There are DOM elements
[15:50:31] <raj> DOM element?
[15:50:33] <raj> ok
[15:50:42] <Eviltwin> But a jQuery object is not a DOM element
[15:50:53] <raj> with a wrapper
[15:51:01] <raj> that provides additional properties for the element
[15:51:03] <Eviltwin> And the most important distinction between the features of DOM elements and jQuery objects is that jQuery objects can hold any number of DOM elements
[15:51:06] <Eviltwin> Including 0
[15:51:16] <raj> ok, cool
[15:51:21] <raj> that's def important
[15:51:21] <Eviltwin> They have what is called an "array-like" or "arrayish" structure
[15:51:32] <raj> k
[15:51:35] <Eviltwin> Which means that the first element in the collection is at key "0"
[15:51:38] <Eviltwin> And the second at key "1"
[15:51:39] <Eviltwin> And so on
[15:51:42] <raj> ok
[15:51:48] <raj> hence .length
[15:51:55] <Eviltwin> And the "length" property is the number of things in there (one larger than the greatest numeric key)
[15:52:17] <Eviltwin> As a result it's better to think of a jQuery object as more like an array of DOM elements than like a DOM element
[15:52:23] <Eviltwin> Even if it only contains one element
[15:52:37] <raj> ok
[15:52:39] <raj> cool
[15:52:40] <raj> i like that
[15:52:45] <Eviltwin> Now why that's important
[15:52:49] <Eviltwin> ?eval [1] in [1,2,3,4]
[15:52:51] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[15:53:03] <Eviltwin> That's an array
[15:53:09] <Shapeshifter> nvm
[15:53:17] <raj> ya
[15:53:18] <Eviltwin> ?eval [1,2] in [1,2,3,4]
[15:53:19] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[15:53:42] <Eviltwin> A jQuery object is more like this:
[15:53:52] <Eviltwin> ?eval ({"0":1,"length":1}) in [1,2,3,4]
[15:54:04] <bot-t> Eviltwin: No output. (Process Killed)
[15:54:19] <Eviltwin> ?eval (({"0":1,"length":1}) in [1,2,3,4])
[15:54:20] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[15:54:36] <Eviltwin> Because it's not actually an array but it's an object with array-like properties
[15:54:49] <Eviltwin> When using an "in" test, it's treated as its own entity
[15:55:00] <Eviltwin> Another important piece of information
[15:55:09] <Eviltwin> About how jQuery objects and DOM elements differ
[15:55:32] <Eviltwin> Is that jQuery objects are newly created each time
[15:55:50] <Eviltwin> ?eval document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0] === document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]
[15:55:51] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[15:55:58] <Eviltwin> Oh, right, not in there
[15:56:12] <Eviltwin> Okay, well in a normal document that will be true
[15:56:19] <Eviltwin> However $("head") === $("head") will be false
[15:56:23] <Whirl3d> receipts, hold on a second, I'm looking at it
[15:56:33] <Eviltwin> Because the $(...) actually constructs a new object and fills it with the elements that match
[15:56:48] <Eviltwin> It's the same reason for this test
[15:56:53] <Eviltwin> ?eval ({}) === ({})
[15:56:54] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[15:57:03] <Eviltwin> That's false even though they both represent the same thing
[15:57:04] <raj> that's super important too
[15:57:05] <raj> thank you
[15:57:10] <nFFF> ?$("head")[0] === $("head")[0]
[15:57:14] <bot-t> nFFF, #5714 (append() Doesn't Work for <head> Elements in IE) ñ jQuery ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5714
[15:57:25] <Eviltwin> The reason your "in" isn't working
[15:57:25] <nFFF> ?eval $("head")[0] === $("head")[0]
[15:57:26] <bot-t> nFFF: true
[15:57:38] <Eviltwin> Is because it's trying to see if that jQuery collection is one of the keys for that object
[15:57:53] <Eviltwin> Because when you use "in" on an object, it's looking to see if that's a key
[15:57:54] <Eviltwin> Like this:
[15:58:02] <Eviltwin> ?eval "hello" in ({"hello": "world"})
[15:58:03] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[15:58:41] <receipts> whirl3d: thank you kindly
[15:58:44] <raj> ok
[15:58:49] <Eviltwin> So you can do this:
[15:58:58] <Eviltwin> ?eval "prevUntil" in $("head")
[15:58:59] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[15:59:14] <Eviltwin> But if you want to see if a collection contains an element, that's not going to work
[15:59:23] <Eviltwin> ?eval $("head")[0] in $("head")
[15:59:23] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[15:59:26] <Eviltwin> ?eval $("head") in $("head")
[15:59:27] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[15:59:45] <Eviltwin> To do those sorts of tests, you want to use jQuery's .is method
[15:59:46] <nFFF> Eviltwin, why does "prevUntil" in head return true?
[15:59:48] <Eviltwin> Documented here: http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:59:57] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Because it's a property of the jQuery object
[16:00:03] <Eviltwin> $("head").prevUntil
[16:00:21] <nFFF> understood
[16:00:49] <Eviltwin> raj: Your other problem is a common misconception in JavaScript
[16:00:58] <Eviltwin> The difference between a reference to a function and executing a function
[16:01:20] <Eviltwin> selected_list is a function that returns a jQuery collection
[16:01:23] <Eviltwin> But it's still a function
[16:01:35] <Eviltwin> If you want to get the jQuery collection it returns, you have to run it first
[16:01:54] <Eviltwin> So selected_list().each(...) is more like what you want
[16:02:16] <Eviltwin> However what you're doing inside is immediately calling the same jQuery method on each element in the jQuery object
[16:02:25] <Eviltwin> Which is silly since jQuery methods do that anyway
[16:02:46] <Eviltwin> The same effect .each(function(i, elem) { $(elem).addClass("selected") }) has
[16:02:52] <Eviltwin> Can be achieved by doing just .addClass("selected")
[16:03:14] <Eviltwin> These are all pretty basic things covered in the first few chapters of the jQuery Fundamentals book
[16:03:21] <Eviltwin> Linked here: see ?learn
[16:03:22] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[16:04:20] <Eviltwin> You should now have enough information such that, with a little reading of the docs, you can fix your code
[16:04:40] <Eviltwin> You know more about how and why certain things do and don't work
[16:05:04] <Eviltwin> And you're getting the exercise of reading jQuery's incredible thorough docs at api.jquery.com
[16:05:23] <Eviltwin> Which is how you can answer 99% of your questions about jQuery
[16:05:55] <nFFF> Eviltwin, prototype method vs object literal method of building functions
[16:06:00] <nFFF> which one do you use
[16:08:26] <Whirl3d> receipts, I replied in the forum for you. Let me know if it works or not.
[16:08:27] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Completely depends on how I want to use it
[16:08:42] <raj> Eviltwin, thank you, that was fantastic
[16:08:57] <nFFF> Eviltwin, Im looking for exmaples to use one over the other
[16:08:58] <raj> just so you know, i read the jquery docs daily
[16:09:29] <receipts> whirl3d: thank you so much!
[16:09:33] <receipts> I'll read it now
[16:11:05] <walidvb> Eviltwin: do you by any chance know how to use it in processing/JAVA?
[16:11:56] <Eviltwin> walidvb: How to use what?
[16:12:09] <walidvb> hehe sry
[16:12:12] <walidvb> the regexp
[16:12:31] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, when you get a chance, I'd like to know why you chose to test for meta-key/ctrl and not-shift...it's brilliant, but I wonder what gave you the inclination to do that rather than testing for meta/control and shift...
[16:12:33] <Eviltwin> Oh, not really
[16:12:45] <kristofer91> hey guys, i made an effect on a div, but if you hover the div 5 time in a row the div does the effect 5 times, since it's a slow effect it's really retarted
[16:12:59] <walidvb> Eviltwin: easy i just thought i'd ask.
[16:13:00] <kristofer91> Isn't there a function to reset or something
[16:13:05] <Whirl3d> that was a difficult question to ask, so let me know if I made any sense there. LOL
[16:13:09] <Eviltwin> walidvb: You mean last.length == 0 || (!e.shiftKey && !e.metaKey && !e.ctrlKey)?
[16:13:13] <Eviltwin> Err
[16:13:16] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: You mean last.length == 0 || (!e.shiftKey && !e.metaKey && !e.ctrlKey)?
[16:13:19] <walidvb> hehe
[16:13:29] <eddiemonge> ?stop @ kristofer91
[16:13:30] <bot-t> (15 hours 40 mins ago) <coldhead> tell eddiemonge gmt+10
[16:13:30] <bot-t> kristofer91, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[16:13:41] <kristofer91> thanks
[16:14:35] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, you handled two cases in your function:  one was meta, ctrl key click  and one was NOT SHIFT, which turned out to make a lot of sense, but I would have never thought of it like that.
[16:15:24] <Eviltwin> Oh, I'm good with boolean stuff and fall through
[16:15:50] <Whirl3d> I'd say. Any books I could read to do that better?
[16:16:06] <Eviltwin> It really just takes writing a lot of code
[16:16:17] <Whirl3d> I was afriad of that.
[16:16:20] <Eviltwin> I mean there are some handy rules for reducing expressions
[16:16:40] <Whirl3d> Have you written a book (yet?) And if not, would you consider it?
[16:16:56] <Eviltwin> Like (!e.shiftKey && !e.metaKey && !e.ctrlKey) is identical to !(e.shiftKey || e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) by DeMorgan's law
[16:17:37] <Eviltwin> I'm thinking about writing something that's not quite a book for jQuery/JavaScript stuff
[16:17:50] <Eviltwin> I say it's not a book because I don't think it'd be flat
[16:18:00] <Whirl3d> I'll buy it for sure if you do.
[16:18:13] <Eviltwin> It think it'd have interactive examples, linking and possibly some neat inline stuff
[16:18:34] <Eviltwin> Probably free on the web
[16:18:40] <_Nike_> is possible with jquery execute a php function of file ??
[16:18:52] <Eviltwin> And if I decide to try to get any revenue out of it, it'd probably be by donation like I do here
[16:19:05] <Whirl3d> How do you do donations here?
[16:19:48] <Eviltwin> http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[16:19:52] <Eviltwin> With that
[16:20:28] <_Nike_> anyone ?
[16:20:46] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: no. jquery is front end and php is backend
[16:21:20] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: you can ajax call a page that happens to have php on it and get what php outputs
[16:21:22] <raj> so this is invalid? var next_list = $.each($targ.nextUntil('now-selected').className)
[16:21:31] <eddiemonge> yes
[16:21:33] <Eviltwin> _Nike_: PHP writes HTML/JavaScript/CSS on the server and then sends it to the client then the cleitn runs the JavaScript
[16:21:41] <_Nike_> eddiemonge how ?
[16:21:44] <eddiemonge> raj: what are you hoping to accomplish
[16:21:51] <_Nike_> eddiemonge how ajax call a page?
[16:21:58] <Eviltwin> raj: What are you trying to do there?
[16:22:05] <raj> i wanna get a list of all classes that are to follow
[16:22:20] <raj> then I can check if the string 'now-selected' is in there
[16:22:25] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: page.php:  <?php echo "Hello"; ?>  JS: $.get("page.php");
[16:22:43] <eddiemonge> raj: siblings or children?
[16:22:46] <raj> siblings
[16:22:48] <Eviltwin> raj: You'd want .map for that
[16:22:51] <_Nike_> eddiemonge will redirect the page, or no ?
[16:23:05] <raj> all siblings of $targ until we hit .now-selected
[16:23:08] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: no. thats what ajax is for, not redirecting the page
[16:23:18] <raj> problem is, if we never hit .now-selected it just goes to the end
[16:23:33] <raj> so I need to check nextUntil and prevUntil and see where now-selected was
[16:23:49] <Eviltwin> Why don't you take a peek at how I solved that problem: http://jsfiddle.net/EthJP/
[16:24:14] <Eviltwin> li.prevAll().is(selected) and li.nextAll().is(selected)
[16:24:17] <_Nike_> wow
[16:24:19] <_Nike_> thanks!
[16:24:20] <_Nike_> ^^
[16:24:33] <Eviltwin> Where selected is the collection of selected elements
[16:24:44] <_Nike_> eddiemonge and print the php output in a div of the same page ... is possible?
[16:25:01] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: yes. see ? ajax.load
[16:25:02] <bot-t> _Nike_, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[16:25:37] <raj> cool Eviltwin, i'll give that a shot
[16:28:46] <_Nike_> and html api ?
[16:29:23] <eddiemonge> HTML api?
[16:29:39] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ _Nike_
[16:29:40] <bot-t> _Nike_, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[16:31:12] <eddiemonge> _Nike_: http://docs.jquery.com/Category:Ajax
[16:33:45] <_Nike_> all examples that I downloaded have "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" ... why don't download the jquery.min.js and put in the root folder? ¬¨¬¨
[16:33:48] <_Nike_> is the best, no ?

[16:41:53] <juha-> hey someone good at css, please help me with an transparent -> inherit issue with border colors <3
[16:42:25] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ juha-
[16:42:26] <bot-t> juha-, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:44:12] <eddiemonge> juha-: or if its pure css, ask in #css
[16:44:29] <juha-> http://userpics.com/toplist.php?loltest2=1# <- so when the page background is white, it's cool and all, but when you click on the toggle background, you see my issue.. i've tried changing border & background color to transparent and then inherit it in ::after & ::before but it's inheriting the background image
[16:44:44] <juha-> eddiemonge: yeah, i've found that #css is usually full of jerks :/
[16:44:56] <juha-> that's why i ask here as #jquery is full of awesome people
[16:45:44] <eddiemonge> i dont understand the issue
[16:46:42] <Eviltwin> #css is full of lovely people who only want to help you in a kind manner
[16:47:44] <juha-> let's try it then
[16:47:45] <coldhead> AHAHAHAHAHHAHA Eviltwin <3
[16:48:05] <coldhead> god if i had ops i would put that in the topic
[16:50:06] <Eviltwin> I have ops but I'm not going to
[16:50:34] <Eviltwin> juha-: You have on line 88 in your CSS: border-color: transparent white white;
[16:51:02] <juha-> yes i do, any ideas on that?
[16:51:23] <eddiemonge> i still dont understand what the problem is
[16:51:33] <Eviltwin> I think you can't do what you're trying to do. Is there a reason you can't just cut a PNG like this?
[16:52:50] <juha-> i have about 15 background images which scales to the whole width/height of the screen, and there are lot's of different resolutions out there
[16:52:57] <Eviltwin> BTW you're missing a semicolon on line 101
[16:53:02] <juha-> on a white background it's pretty awesome
[16:53:10] <juha-> i fixed that semicolon
[16:53:16] <juha-> i think
[16:53:32] <Eviltwin> I'm asking why for http://cdn.userpics.com/mediumcrop/internet_memes_dropping_the_science_a_win_win.jpg
[16:53:38] <Eviltwin> You can't just cut out the little piece
[16:53:54] <Eviltwin> Use an alpha channel
[16:54:16] <juha-> hmm, editing the image is not an option, i want to do this in css
[16:54:24] <juha-> alpha channel?
[16:54:26] <juha-> hmm
[16:54:28] <Eviltwin> There are many things CSS can't do
[16:54:47] <juha-> yeah
[16:55:06] <ndss56> Eviltwin: were you being sarcastic about helpful and friendly people in #css?
[16:55:15] <juha-> i actually got the idea from tumblr, they are doing it with an background image, i want to see how far i can get this by using css only
[16:55:21] <Eviltwin> ndss56: Mildly
[16:55:26] <juha-> ndss56: yes he was
[16:56:07] <ndss56> Eviltwin: I concur. The channel is not well moderated.
[16:57:29] <Eviltwin> Maybe you could do something with an embedded SVG
[16:58:15] <juha-> i tried alpha channel.. doesn't seem to help..
[16:58:26] <juha-> well, maybe i got it as far as it's currently possible to get
[16:58:49] <juha-> hmm
[16:58:54] <eddiemonge> where exactly is the example on tumblr that you are referencing?
[16:59:19] <juha-> eddiemonge: when you go to the dasboard, on the right side under search
[16:59:25] <juha-> there is an image that is an bubble
[16:59:58] <eddiemonge> ugh. that means i have to join
[17:00:22] <juha-> i can take a screenshot for you :P
[17:00:30] <eddiemonge> yes please
[17:00:59] <juha-> http://cdn.userpics.com/upload/screen_shot_2012_03_20_at_2.png
[17:01:21] <juha-> http://assets.tumblr.com/images/dashboard_controls/radar_sprite.png this is the sprite that they use
[17:01:40] <eddiemonge> yeah, thats completely different than what you are trying to do
[17:01:55] <juha-> not completely
[17:02:02] <eddiemonge> they have a set background. your background is dynamic
[17:02:08] <juha-> yeah
[17:02:16] <eddiemonge> like i said, completely different
[17:02:26] <juha-> i got it to work on a specific background color (white for example)
[17:02:33] <juha-> but the issue is the background image
[17:02:34] <eddiemonge> and you are trying to extend the image above the arrow
[17:05:44] <oojacoboo> can someone explain why this is invalid‚Ä¶ (ii % 2) ? customQuestionsLeft : customQuestionsRight)
[17:05:59] <oojacoboo> those are already defined variables
[17:06:15] <juha-> whas is ii?
[17:06:18] <oojacoboo> index
[17:06:24] <oojacoboo> $.each()
[17:07:05] <juha-> have you tried ii % 2 == 0 ? .. : ..; ?
[17:07:18] <oojacoboo> no, but I don't see why that'd make a diff :/
[17:07:31] <eddiemonge> you have a trailing paren that doesnt have a matching opening
[17:07:40] <oojacoboo> yea, copy foul
[17:07:46] <oojacoboo> that's not the issue
[17:07:52] <badbandit> hello, I am using bxslider plugin and am trying to have the height of the container change depending on the height of the content... I have this http://hastebin.com/maruwopive.coffee, however it is changing to the previous slides height not the current... how could I make it do the current?
[17:08:03] <chilversc> oojacoboo: then I'd say it isn't invalid, so what's the error?
[17:08:43] <oojacoboo> referenceError
[17:09:02] <eddiemonge> that means the variable isnt defined
[17:09:04] <chilversc> oojacoboo: place a break point there and check that those 2 really do exist?
[17:09:13] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ badbandit
[17:09:13] <bot-t> badbandit, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:09:27] <badbandit> I cant
[17:09:39] <badbandit> the images used are mogrified on a server
[17:10:05] <eddiemonge> html/js/css
[17:13:02] <oojacoboo> () around the entire thing was trowing an issue
[17:13:17] <oojacoboo> works without that
[17:13:29] <oojacoboo> I just thought it was cleaner with it since after was a +=
[17:13:31] <oojacoboo> but w/e
[17:13:34] <foo> I have href="#something" - but I also have a jquery function to listen with onClick. When someone clicks the accordion tab, the tab expands, but it doesn't update #tabname in the URL. hmm, is it possible that the code never gets that far and stops at onClick ?
[17:14:45] <eddiemonge> whats the function?
[17:24:20] <raj> how can I removeClass('selected') for any of the items btwn $nowSelected and $targ? http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/157/
[17:24:28] <raj> otherwise it removes
[17:24:33] <raj> i mean, otherwise it works
[17:24:39] <raj> but i need it to know when to remove
[17:24:56] <raj> (if all the items in btwn have class='selected')
[17:25:08] <raj> otherwise, it should in fact highlight the unhighlighted ones, the way it does
[17:29:20] <snagnever> hey! i have some html loaded asynchronously and i wanted a plugin to be loaded for some of the elements there. is there a way to get it as those live()/on() events?
[17:37:19] <snagnever> please?
[17:43:30] <csotelo> hello guys
[17:43:42] <csotelo> I have a problem using a jquery plugin on ie
[17:44:01] <csotelo> hello? some one available?
[17:46:58] <scr3am> which one?
[17:49:00] <miket3> Don't use ie.  switch all users to FF.  and LINUX
[17:51:57] <scr3am> miket3: which one?
[17:56:18] <miket3> scr3am, doesnt matter.  I think any LINUX OS will be better than windows....i use opensuse
[17:56:47] <scr3am> yeah, i totally agree...
[17:57:22] <ngharo> LOONIX
[18:16:47] <Italian_Plumber> knoppix
[18:19:44] <raj> is this a valid way to get a class?--> .on('click', function(e) { if(e.target.is('selected')){alert('hi')}})
[18:20:00] <Eviltwin> To get a class?
[18:20:06] <raj> yeah
[18:20:39] <Eviltwin> I'd start by looking here: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/
[18:23:07] <raj> oh right, I was thinking the jquery wrapped dom element was an array like object, so I could do that
[18:26:06] <raj> ok, so i just did this--> isSelected = if($targ.className == 'selected')?true;false{;
[18:26:20] <raj> oops, typo
[18:27:05] <gnarf> raj: $(e.target).is(.selected)
[18:27:14] <gnarf> raj: $(e.target).is(".selected")
[18:27:18] <gnarf> missed the quotes
[18:28:32] <raj> damnit, needed the jquery wrapper, of course
[18:28:36] <raj> thank you
[18:34:33] <Eviltwin> EVERY jQUery collection is an array-like object
[18:52:28] <kristofer91> Hey guys,
[18:52:35] <kristofer91> Anyone have an idea of how this could be done :)
[18:52:36] <kristofer91> http://dribbble.com/shots/363401-Facebook-button-concept
[18:53:29] <raj> can a ternary use `return`?
[18:54:29] <johnkpaul> raj: a ternary operator is an expression that produces a value that can then be returned
[18:54:55] <dwarder> how is that param called for input text that shows example text in the field and then hides it upon user entering his data?
[18:55:07] <raj> ok, so it returns by nature
[18:55:14] <raj> beautiful
[18:57:45] <raj> will this only return true if each of nextAll's items have '.selected'--> all_selected = $targ.nextAll().each(function(){if(this.className=='selected')true:false})
[18:58:12] <raj> is `this` already wrapped cuz nextAll() records jquery wrapped dom elements?
[18:59:12] <Eviltwin> In most cases "this" is not wrapped
[18:59:22] <raj> ok, cool
[18:59:35] <johnkpaul> raj: just use "return $(this).hasClass("selected")
[18:59:43] <johnkpaul> it's much more understandable than the ternary you're using
[18:59:46] <phil-adept> hi all
[18:59:57] <raj> thank you
[19:00:07] <johnkpaul> also, .each doesn't accept a return value
[19:00:11] <johnkpaul> perhaps you want a .filter
[19:00:15] <johnkpaul> ?filter @raj
[19:00:15] <bot-t> raj, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:00:40] <johnkpaul> also, damn, haven't you been in this channel for over 12 hours? get some sleep man
[19:00:51] <raj> that'll be useful in the future
[19:00:52] <raj> thanks
[19:01:01] <johnkpaul> ha, sleep? I bet it will
[19:01:03] <raj> me?
[19:01:04] <raj> sleep?
[19:01:11] <johnkpaul> :)
[19:01:14] <johnkpaul> good night jQuery
[19:01:20] <raj> :) goodnight
[19:01:28] <Whirl3d> gnite johnkpaul
[19:06:19] <raj> does the each function have to be called?
[19:06:28] <raj> the unnamed function within .each()
[19:10:43] <xp_prg2> hi all, I am trying to return an array from a .each, is that possible or do I have to return them individually?
[19:11:56] <raj> xp_prg2, maybe map?
[19:12:02] <raj> ?.map
[19:12:03] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[19:12:21] <raj> and add them to a list
[19:12:28] <raj> each can probably do it too
[19:12:41] <raj> i mean, add them to an array within the each function
[19:12:57] <xp_prg2> oh ok raj, ya I chose to do that
[19:13:11] <xp_prg2> I was just curious if I wanted to return them individually if they coudl be assembled into an array somehow
[19:13:28] <raj> ?.array
[19:13:29] <bot-t> raj, Couldn't find ".array" in jQuery Docs.
[19:13:37] <raj> ?.arrayify
[19:13:38] <bot-t> raj, Couldn't find ".arrayify" in jQuery Docs.
[19:19:26] <Eviltwin> raj: see ?.get
[19:19:26] <bot-t> raj, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[19:32:26] <sgo11> hi, I am trying to support IE6 by using special .css file and .js files. actually, I used this project: https://github.com/empowering-communities/Bootstrap-IE6    but it seems that is not working. and I found out one problem is the .js line:  $('[class*="span"]').addClass('margin-left-20'); that does not work as what it expects. I am a newbie on this. any ideas? thanks a lot.
[19:32:56] <raj> nextUntil creates an array, no?

[19:37:27] <abnormalex> I built what I thought was a properly validating form, but today I received an e-mail from "unknown sender". Can anyone please tell how someone could send this form without an email? http://eternaware.com/support
[19:38:11] <oojacoboo> send without an email?!
[19:38:37] <oojacoboo> oh, I see what you mean now
[19:38:51] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, yeah without anything in the email inputbox
[19:38:54] <oojacoboo> how is anyone going to know how to answer that without seeing your backend code?
[19:39:02] <oojacoboo> client side validation isn't sufficient
[19:39:14] <abnormalex> i guess... i just thought someone could try to hack it or whatever the person did haha
[19:39:17] <oojacoboo> all I have to do is take your POST url and pass the params
[19:39:23] <oojacoboo> it's easy
[19:40:21] <abnormalex> ah your right, simply putting the POST url sends me an e-mail...
[19:41:00] <oojacoboo> did you get my request abnormalex ?
[19:41:06] <abnormalex> Uh oh!
[19:41:08] <abnormalex> was that it
[19:41:18] <oojacoboo> how about that one?
[19:41:37] <oojacoboo> how about that one without the email?
[19:41:39] <abnormalex> yeah diddnt say anything
[19:41:50] <racar> Hello folks, i want to select the inner h3 (test1 and test2). I NEED to start from the ('#res li>h3') to locate them. http://jsfiddle.net/yyw2H/1/  Any ideas ? thx
[19:41:55] <abnormalex> yes i am getting lots of contact requests with an email haha
[19:42:01] <oojacoboo> abnormalex: lesson‚Ä¶. server side validation bro
[19:42:15] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, i see, i need to learn about this
[19:42:18] <abnormalex> does this mean php validation?
[19:42:18] <oojacoboo> http://eternaware.com/scripts/support?email=%22you@you.com%22&category=%22general%22&content=%22your%20form%20blows%22
[19:42:58] <oojacoboo> if that's the server side lang you use, yes
[19:45:08] <sgo11> will this $('[class*="span"]').addClass('margin-left-20');  work in IE6? if no, how can I do it? thanks.
[19:45:37] <oojacoboo> margin-left-20?
[19:45:46] <oojacoboo> oh, that's a class LOL
[19:45:51] <oojacoboo> wow‚Ä¶ *sad*
[19:46:43] <oojacoboo> ?tias
[19:46:43] <sgo11> oojacoboo, thanks for your reply. you can check my first post. I simply downloaded that simple project. it says it works in IE6. but it doesn't work in my case.
[19:46:43] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:47:23] <oojacoboo> sgo11: that's the worst use of code I've ever seen
[19:47:30] <oojacoboo> why in gods name is that in js anyway?
[19:47:37] <oojacoboo> why wouldn't that be in your css?
[19:49:02] <sgo11> oojacoboo, that is just trying to support bootstrap project css for IE6. in the bootstrap.css, it has this: [class*="span"] {float: left;  margin-left: 20px;}
[19:49:43] <oojacoboo> that's why I don't use bootstrapper crap
[19:49:47] <oojacoboo> for that reason right there
[19:50:09] <oojacoboo> sgo11: I wouldn't know where to start with that web of code you're dealing with
[19:50:30] <sgo11> oojacoboo, if boostrap is crap, can you suggest any good alternative ones? I am bad on design a good looking UI page. thanks.
[19:50:33] <oojacoboo> .span {} much?
[19:51:22] <oojacoboo> I don't suggest using any of them the way they are
[19:51:56] <sgo11> oojacoboo, I am new on css and jquery. the css will work in IE6 if I insert the code float: left; margin-left: 20px; to every .span like .span1, .span2 .span3 etc...
[19:52:22] <oojacoboo> sgo11: use    .span
[19:52:31] <oojacoboo> not [class*="span"]
[19:52:34] <oojacoboo> that's terrible
[19:52:46] <oojacoboo> oh wait, I see what you're doing
[19:52:47] <oojacoboo> sorry
[19:52:55] <oojacoboo> why are they span1, span2?
[19:54:05] <sgo11> oojacoboo, I am really new on this. you can have a look at this: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css
[19:54:29] <sgo11> oohnoitz, it seems it uses different spans with different width.
[19:54:45] <oojacoboo> yea, that's stupod
[19:54:48] <oojacoboo> stupid*
[19:55:01] <oojacoboo> it's fine if you need that, but that should be site specific
[19:55:36] <oojacoboo> sgo11: did you generate this with a grid?
[19:56:41] <sgo11> oojacoboo, well, bootstrap looks cool and I am new on all of these things. so just trying to use it. in this case, what can I do?  I don't know why https://github.com/empowering-communities/Bootstrap-IE6/blob/master/ie6.js does not work in my IE6. thanks.
[19:57:34] <oojacoboo> sgo11: I have no idea what your question is anymore
[19:57:48] <oojacoboo> either way this is a question for #css
[19:59:12] <abnormalex> think i fixed the email part of my form, http://eternaware.com/support , anyone care to try and "hack" it?
[19:59:31] <oojacoboo> http://eternaware.com/scripts/support?email=%22you@you.com%22&category=%22general%22&content=%22your%20form%20blows%22
[19:59:36] <oojacoboo> click that abnormalex
[19:59:54] <abnormalex> it returns fail_email
[19:59:55] <sgo11> oojacoboo, I just started to learn how to use bootstrap and jquery yesterday. so don't know much about them. I created one single page with some divs. then I met this problem. looks fine in chrome, but incorrect in ie6. then I found that project. yeah, it's css question. but that project uses jquery js modifies the css, so that's why I am asking here. and one guy here introduces bootstrap to me in this channel yesterday. ^_^ thanks.
[20:00:53] <oojacoboo> sgo11: nice story, but I still don't know your question ;)
[20:02:02] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, its obvious
[20:02:07] <abnormalex> hes having this problem, with that project
[20:02:27] <oojacoboo> sgo11: I think abnormalex might be best to help
[20:03:50] <abnormalex> yes ive had this problem before, but it was not with that project. it was with the other project.
[20:04:35] <sgo11> sorry about my English. not very good. I think the problem I met in IE6 is because this line $('[class*="span"]').addClass('margin-left-20'); does not work in my IE6.  My html page does not show correctly is because the span1, span2 etc.. does not have the class margin-left-20 (float: left; margin-left: 20px;).  something like that. I just started to learn jquery, css and bootstrap yesterday. so, really. I don't know much. thanks.
[20:05:29] <abnormalex> oh sorry i don't know :/
[20:05:32] <abnormalex> i dont even test with ie6
[20:05:33] <oojacoboo> sgo11: make a testcase
[20:05:42] <oojacoboo> ?testcase @ sgo11
[20:05:42] <bot-t> sgo11, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[20:06:46] <sgo11> oojacoboo, I can put my simple html codes in pastebin. wait a second and thanks a lot for your patience.
[20:07:06] <oojacoboo> sgo11: jsfildde.net
[20:07:21] <oojacoboo> make a real testcase that you can prove works or doesn't work in IE6
[20:07:58] <raj> ?.isnot
[20:07:59] <bot-t> raj, Couldn't find ".isnot" in jQuery Docs.
[20:08:11] <oojacoboo> raj:   :not
[20:08:22] <Eviltwin> raj: !collection.is(...)
[20:08:59] <sgo11> oojacoboo, thanks. let me try to use that site. never used it before.
[20:09:24] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, damn, someone just sent me unknown sender, message = "dafuq"
[20:09:40] <oojacoboo> :)
[20:10:16] <abnormalex> how? :( i validated php
[20:10:33] <oojacoboo> I doubt it
[20:10:41] <abnormalex> what do you doubt
[20:11:13] <gnarf> sgo11: out of curiosity
[20:11:31] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, i validated:
[20:11:31] <abnormalex> if(filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
[20:11:34] <gnarf> sgo11: what is creating a situation where you need to use [class*="span"] because thats just a pretty horrible selector
[20:11:41] <sgo11> oojacoboo, in my case, I think a pastebin will work. but this is the html page: very simple: http://jsfiddle.net/YwyKS/
[20:12:11] <Eviltwin> sgo11: Don't see any jQuery here :P
[20:12:27] <gnarf> sgo11: http://jsfiddle.net/YwyKS/1/
[20:12:54] <gnarf> sgo11: you know elements can have two classes right?
[20:13:13] <gnarf> class="spanner span5"
[20:13:20] <gnarf> apply the margin to .spanner
[20:13:24] <oojacoboo> gnarf: he's using the bullshit ass twitter bootstrap
[20:13:24] <gnarf> and the width to .span5
[20:14:00] <sgo11> Eviltwin, the jquery is basically this file: https://github.com/empowering-communities/Bootstrap-IE6/blob/master/ie6.js
[20:14:00] <gnarf> oojacoboo: that is twitter generated html?
[20:14:20] <oojacoboo> gnarf: not sure about the html, but those nasty class names
[20:14:36] <gnarf> sgo11: can you edit the html/
[20:14:45] <gnarf> sgo11: because if you can, fix that
[20:14:48] <Eviltwin> sgo11: How about you put the jQuery in there so we can have a live (working) demo
[20:15:00] <gnarf> its way faster than [class*='span']
[20:15:20] <sgo11> OK. let me do put the js there.
[20:15:32] <gnarf> oojacoboo: looks a little like a grid
[20:18:12] <systemfault> Oh shit.. ie6 :/
[20:18:36] <oojacoboo> gnarf: yea, that's what I assumed
[20:19:01] <oojacoboo> still not a fan ;)
[20:19:02] <gnarf> sgo11: can you edit the html?
[20:19:17] <sgo11> yeah. this is: http://jsfiddle.net/YwyKS/3/
[20:19:46] <sgo11> I am trying to access this page in ie6. the alert does not show. I don't know why.
[20:20:11] <gnarf> sgo11: you forgot to include jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/YwyKS/4/
[20:20:44] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, are you still sending me unknown contact requests?
[20:20:54] <oojacoboo> u mad bro?
[20:21:18] <gnarf> sgo11: [class*="span"] is a pretty horrible css selector
[20:21:35] <Eviltwin> It's a magical CSS selector
[20:21:44] <gnarf> sgo11: use two classes: class="span span3"
[20:21:55] <abnormalex> oojacoboo, no, im really not
[20:22:03] <coldhead> span is a pretty horrible classname
[20:22:10] <gnarf> coldhead++
[20:22:12] <oojacoboo> coldhead: shhhh
[20:22:18] <oojacoboo> it's twitter, don't question them
[20:22:22] <Eviltwin> class is a better class name
[20:22:24] <abnormalex> if anyone can contact me at eternaware.com/support with unknown sender, please try again
[20:22:46] <sgo11> gnarf, thanks for pointing out this. can you show me a tutorial on  [class*="span"]. be serious, I don't know what  [class*="span"] does. so not sure how to change it back. thanks.
[20:23:31] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[20:23:45] <Whirl3d> gawd I hate that Tablets don't have mouseover equivalents...
[20:24:22] <abnormalex> x@x.x is valid in my book =D thanks
[20:24:47] <gnarf> ?attribute contains selector @sgo11
[20:24:48] <Eviltwin> Should probably put a min on the comment body though
[20:24:48] <bot-t> sgo11, Attribute Contains Selector [name*="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing the a given substring. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[20:25:43] <sgo11> Eviltwin, gnarf, saw it. thanks a lot. so what I should do now is removing the js file and modify the css so that it does not have attribute contains selector. right? thanks.
[20:25:44] <gnarf> sgo11: css engines don't really optimize for that selector... the "class selector" is much much faster
[20:26:20] <sgo11> gnarf, got it. thanks a lot.
[20:26:23] <gnarf> sgo11: some of those like :last-child are kinda unavoidable
[20:26:53] <systemfault> Has anyone ever made a website where selectors are the bottleneck?
[20:27:17] <gnarf> sgo11: http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/  http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/test/index.html
[20:27:45] <wookiehangover> systemfault: only if you favor crappy selectors
[20:27:52] <Eviltwin> I wouldn't say they're generally a "bottleneck" but I've had sites were a bad selector made them noticeably less responsive on a slow system or phone
[20:28:18] <sgo11> gnarf, I am just curious. why does that code not work in my IE6? that js file suppose to fix ie6 problem. with this line: $('[class*="span"]').addClass('margin-left-20');  thanks.
[20:28:26] <gnarf> systemfault: lots of elements + a few bad selectors in stylesheets can make redraw significantly slower
[20:28:47] <oojacoboo> systemfault: that'd depend on the client
[20:28:48] <gnarf> sgo11: do you have a class called "margin-left-20" ?? because i don't see it in the css
[20:29:22] <sgo11> gnarf, yeah, it has. it is the last one in css on that url example.
[20:29:40] <sgo11> gnarf, http://jsfiddle.net/YwyKS/4/
[20:30:27] <mikesherov> .
[20:33:10] <imsky> :V
[20:33:41] <abnormalex> duck face?
[20:38:54] <sgo11> gnarf, that problem gets fixed by using IE9.js http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/   the one you just suggested me. thanks.
[20:39:09] <PyRSqr> is it possible to select elements that have class x but not class y  in one expression?
[20:41:00] <gnarf> PyRSqr: one jQuery selection yes
[20:41:09] <sgo11> gnarf, just FYI. with IE9.js, I even do not need this project at all: https://github.com/empowering-communities/Bootstrap-IE6 .
[20:41:09] <gnarf> .x:not(.y)
[20:41:37] <PyRSqr> that is good new how do you do it
[20:45:25] <rtyler> if I call $('.foo').empty(), the former children should be removed from the DOM forever and get GC'ed correct?
[20:45:31] <sgo11> oojacoboo, Eviltwin, abnormalex, gnarf, just want to say thank you very much for the help, your time, and patience. I learned a lot. and IE9.js is very cool project, it fixes all the problems. just unbelievable.although it is a bit slow, it doesn't matter. users before IE9 should suffer this. thanks.
[20:45:36] <rtyler> or does it just remove them as children?
[20:47:02] <PyRSqr> is .x.y  x an y?
[20:47:23] <PyRSqr> x and y
[20:47:58] <abnormalex> PyRSqr, ... yes
[20:52:57] <raj> when defining a function, how do I ask for a keyword instead of an argument?
[20:53:01] <raj> so order is not of concern
[20:53:57] <coldhead> function aids (options) {...
[20:54:13] <coldhead> and then aids({foo: 'lol', 555: 666})
[20:54:21] <coldhead> thence options.foo;
[20:54:25] <coldhead> otions[555]
[20:54:31] <coldhead> et hoc genus omnes
[20:54:58] <raj> k, so an object
[20:55:07] <raj> is that the correct term?
[20:55:20] <coldhead> yes
[20:55:32] <coldhead> good work
[20:58:51] <raj> coldhead, and call it with an object too?
[20:59:20] <coldhead> you can either do foo({key1:1, key2:2})
[21:00:40] <coldhead> or var options = {key1: 1, key2: 2}; foo(options);
[21:07:55] <raj> coldhead, within the function I have to use aids.foo, I can't just use foo?
[21:08:49] <imsky> aids.foo?
[21:09:39] <raj> ?
[21:09:48] <raj> oh sorry
[21:09:51] <raj> options.foo
[21:09:51] <raj> ok
[21:09:57] <raj> so i can just use foo
[21:13:04] <imsky> why would you ever call an object aids
[21:13:43] <snover> because it‚Äôs shorter than helpers
[21:17:01] <Yoo> hi
[21:20:34] <raj> snover, what are helpers?
[21:21:47] <raj> also, if I have var string1='.hello', string2='.bye'; will $(string1 + string2) be a valid selector?
[21:22:31] <systemfault> Why not?
[21:22:40] <coldhead> raj: you can't just use 'foo', sorry
[21:22:45] <coldhead> it's a property of the options object
[21:22:53] <coldhead> not a regular var
[21:23:45] <Whirl3d> raj, do you realize that you have been in this channel monopolizing the best talents in jquery for more than 12 hours. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to hire these people to teach you jquery? Its not fair to everyone else when you could do like we all had to do: research it and read the api.
[21:24:25] <raj> you shouldn't be in here if you don't wanna answer syntactical questions sometimes
[21:24:43] <raj> and perhaps my `options` question would have been better suited in ##javascript
[21:25:03] <Whirl3d> I love to help, but you are hogging the channel with questions that could be answered in the first 50 pages of any jquery book.
[21:25:12] <snover> http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc etc.
[21:25:32] <raj> i didn't realize I was interfering with someone else asking a question
[21:25:56] <Whirl3d> gnite all.
[21:26:03] <charles_ray> I believe that this will alter the value of the current checked checkbox $(this).val('1');
[21:26:26] <charles_ray> Problem I had is I wanted to pass that via variable.
[21:26:31] <charles_ray> Possible or not?
[21:26:33] <Eviltwin> raj: People just get tired of answering questions for people who don't try to help themselves when there are plenty of other resources avaliable
[21:26:40] <Eviltwin> That don't involve spending our time
[21:26:50] <raj> then just don't answer, geez, I didn't think my questions were that bad
[21:27:32] <raj> charles_ray, what's 'that'?
[21:27:37] <Eviltwin> It's fine if you ask one small question but when I can predict your question by looking at what the next line in your code is, it gets kind of annoying
[21:27:55] <raj> you're an idiot, you have no idea what I'm doing in my code
[21:27:55] <donCams> hello. i am jquery-ai v2.0. i will be answering all your queries from here on.
[21:27:58] <Eviltwin> Makes it seem like you're not bothering to read anything on your own
[21:28:06] <raj> you're helpful, but a dick
[21:28:07] <charles_ray> the checkbox's value
[21:28:15] <raj> i'm trying to abstract my code out
[21:28:18] <raj> chill the hell out
[21:28:38] <donCams> everybody chill! i got this
[21:28:45] <Eviltwin> Oops
[21:29:03] <donCams> hey Eviltwin! can I have one of those + signs on my nick? heh
[21:29:28] <Eviltwin> I don't give out privileges
[21:29:32] <Eviltwin> Not even sure I'm able to
[21:29:43] <donCams> oh. too bad. i want one. it's so fluffy i'm gonna die!
[21:29:43] <charles_ray> Hello?
[21:29:54] <donCams> hey charles_ray. what was your question?
[21:29:57] <Eviltwin> donCams: Beg ajpiano
[21:30:05] <Eviltwin> He can make it happen
[21:30:16] <donCams> yeah. maybe next time. i think he's busy or asleep
[21:30:18] <raj> Eviltwin, which question did you expect?
[21:30:18] <charles_ray> I believe that this will alter the value of the current checked checkbox $(this).val('1');
[21:30:20] <raj> that I asked
[21:30:32] <donCams> charles_ray: yes
[21:30:40] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ raj
[21:30:40] <bot-t> raj, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[21:30:42] <charles_ray> Now what I wanted is to be able to use it in a variable
[21:30:46] <Eviltwin> You need to read those resources
[21:30:52] <Eviltwin> You've been asking 101 question after 101 question
[21:30:57] <donCams> $('elementId:selected').val('1');
[21:31:40] <charles_ray> so it's not possible to var x = $('elementId:selected').val('1');   ??
[21:31:54] <raj> that's what I thought. Don't say stupid things like you know what I'm asking by looking at the next line of my code when you obv don't. You just showed this
[21:32:19] <Eviltwin> raj: You need to learn to respect the people who you're asking for help
[21:32:23] <raj> if you don't want to answer, then don't answer
[21:32:30] <donCams> raj. what's with the attitude? chill due
[21:32:31] <raj> you've been extremely helpful, and I've bee nvery grateful
[21:32:32] <donCams> *dude
[21:32:45] <raj> but i'm also doing something very different from when I was speaking with you
[21:32:47] <donCams> they're just saying. you need some level of effort
[21:32:59] <Eviltwin> You need to learn to be patient when getting help
[21:32:59] <ngharo> everybody, smoke this
[21:33:01] * ngharo passes
[21:33:04] * imsky sells
[21:33:08] <raj> i wasn't pushy
[21:33:09] * imsky profits
[21:33:19] * donCams gets high
[21:33:20] <raj> I asked, when i got an answer, sometimes I had a return question
[21:33:24] <charles_ray> hello?
[21:33:28] <imsky> HELLO
[21:33:34] <imsky> ECHO echo ....
[21:33:35] <ngharo> WHOAOAOAOO

[22:09:06] <imsky> yeah i went through those before
[22:09:10] <imsky> too choppy
[22:09:37] <Eviltwin> Now we just need to add easing
[22:09:48] <imsky> and an even nicer background
[22:10:03] <imsky> also resizing viewport keeps the old spawn locations for letters
[22:10:08] <imsky> should account for that

[22:13:47] <imsky> time to bounce
[22:25:48] <raj> e.target for a click function is returning an <img> or a <p>, but I only want the div that contains those two elements

[22:26:45] <Atty> anyone around
[22:27:39] <Atty> quick jquery question on how to reload a page with a value selected from the datepicker
[22:28:52] <Eviltwin> Atty: Reload a page with a value? What do you mean by that?
[22:31:59] <Atty> ok i have page with a calendar
[22:32:09] <coldhead> cool story bro
[22:32:21] <Atty> and above my calendar is a form with a jquery datepicker
[22:32:36] <Eviltwin> With you so far
[22:32:44] <Atty> I want the calendar to update upon date selection
[22:32:46] <Atty> meaning
[22:33:07] <Atty> I just want to reload the page with a value ie id=12/7/2011
[22:33:24] <Eviltwin> You mean in the URL bar?
[22:33:32] <Atty> correct sir
[22:33:32] <Eviltwin> The query string?
[22:33:58] <Eviltwin> What you want to do is set the window.location variable
[22:34:03] <Eviltwin> That will redirect the browser
[22:34:12] <Eviltwin> You need to construct the full URL with query string
[22:34:20] <Atty> not a problem
[22:34:43] <Atty> I can figure out the query
[22:34:57] <Eviltwin> You can just do window.location = "<new url goes here>"
[22:35:17] <Atty> so is it $(.select or?
[22:35:28] <Eviltwin> Or something like window.location = "http://mysite.com/mypage?id=" + $("#mydatepicker").val();
[22:36:29] <Atty> $('.selector').datepicker({
[22:36:29] <Atty>    onSelect: function(dateText, inst) {window.location = "http://mysite.com/mypage?id=" + $("#mydatepicker").val()}
[22:36:29] <Atty> });
[22:36:32] <Atty> like this
[22:36:32] <Atty> ?
[22:36:53] <Eviltwin> Well, however you're supposed to refer to it inside the onSelect
[22:37:15] <Eviltwin> $(this).val() I think
[22:37:23] <Eviltwin> Or maybe just dateText
[22:37:34] <Eviltwin> I don't remember what those vars represent
[22:38:12] <Atty> I got them from the jquery website...
[22:38:44] <Eviltwin> Yeah, what I'm saying is try $('.selector').datepicker({ onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { window.location = "http://mysite.com/mypage?id=" + dateText; } });
[22:38:55] <Chopps> guys, i have this code for a jquery slider: http://jsfiddle.net/ppyYT/ how can i get the id of the slider im using?
[22:39:00] <Eviltwin> If that doesn't work, try $('.selector').datepicker({ onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { window.location = "http://mysite.com/mypage?id=" + $(this).val(); } });
[22:39:03] <Eviltwin> });
[22:39:06] <Eviltwin> Err, minus the second line
[22:39:26] <Atty> thanks evil ill try it out
[22:39:45] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Should be this.id
[22:40:49] <Eviltwin> BTW all of those resources 403 because you shouldn't be linking those
[22:40:55] <Chopps> awesome Eviltwin, thanks, i tried with $(this).id but gave me undefined, thanks again
[22:41:10] <Eviltwin> Either this.id or $(this).attr("id")
[22:41:54] <Interface> Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me with a quick question
[22:42:46] <Interface> http://pastie.org/private/7yg2fp0obgbycqlgy4vs6a
[22:43:05] <Interface> this is what I have , however it returns the error $("#phone").fadeout is not a function
[22:43:13] <Chopps> lol i did everything wrong before asking then, i tried ui.attr("id") but that gave me an error: ui doesnt have attr function
[22:44:19] <Interface> ohh duhhh
[22:44:25] <Interface> fadeout != fadeOut
[22:44:53] <Atty> hmm no work eviltwin
[22:45:52] <raj> in the same exact spot, every other click will be show console.log(e.target) as `<div class=".container">` or `<div class=".item">`
[22:46:39] <IAmWill> is there a simple "hide" all so that when I activate a toggle, all other jquery displayed div's hide?
[22:46:59] <raj> IAmWill, give them all a class
[22:47:02] <raj> and then hide the class
[22:47:13] <raj> $('customclass').hide()
[22:47:32] <IAmWill> onClick="$('.content_container').toggle( 'clip','fast');  <== i am using that right now on a link, thing is, they just stack, so I would like to hide the others when this link is clicked
[22:53:17] <FirstGod> So, there's this woman I've been going out with every night when I go to sleep and she is God's gift to men. Her name is Madonna and she makes me feel like a virgin after a hard day of YUI debugging.
[22:54:26] <IAmWill> raj: can I use a wild card?  ie... $('.*_container').hide();
[22:54:59] <raj> probably with some regex
[22:55:04] <coldhead> $('[class$="_container"]')
[22:55:12] <raj> oops, sorry
[22:55:42] <raj> i shoulda known that one
[22:56:22] <raj> is there any way to allow e.target to pick the correct target when the border of a div is clicked?
[22:56:33] <raj> i tried outline instead of border, but that didn't seem to help
[22:57:06] <methoddk> long shot, but, anyone use django with dajaxice? been searching for hours, resources and docs are horrible
[22:57:36] <IAmWill> coldhead and raj, thanks... i wont be able to use onClick, but at least the problem is solved

[23:23:03] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Find a CDN for that code
[23:23:27] <Eviltwin> You're not allowed to include http://jqueryui.com/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js etc directly in your page
[23:23:30] <Eviltwin> They block you
[23:24:03] <Chopps> im just using them on jsfliddle
[23:25:02] <jsk143> @firstgod u have any sample and simple code for that
[23:29:06] <Escherial> is it feasible to validate a blob of xml text against a schema on the client?
[23:29:30] <Escherial> i'd like to write an editor that validates the xml without a round-trip (preferably telling me things like on what line an error occurred, etc.)
[23:31:43] <Eviltwin> Escherial: Take a look at this, maybe: http://www.w3schools.com/dom/dom_validate.asp

[23:38:35] <zombi-> anyone know why this doesnt work?
[23:38:43] <zombi-> its supposed to animate the color using switchclass
[23:38:58] <zombi-> it waits the duration and then just switches with no animation
