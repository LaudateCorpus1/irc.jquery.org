[00:14:22] <fabioportieri> morning
[01:21:28] <benjick> Hi. I'm not sure what terms to google for this problem, if anyone could point to some terms I would be glad. I have a div that's horizontal with a lot of boxes in it. I want to scroll 100% of the visible area when I swipe left/right. Say if 4 boxes are showing and I swipe I want to show the next 4.

[01:35:02] <rindolf> Hi all.
[01:35:50] <sn0lan> morning
[01:36:24] <rindolf> sn0lan: good morning. What's up?
[01:43:41] <sn0lan> rindolf: very little. facepalming while someone witters on about turning JS off and how they would serve up a bacbone app
[01:43:49] <sn0lan> lolz
[01:45:08] <rindolf> sn0lan: backbone.js?
[01:45:14] <sn0lan> yeah
[01:45:16] <sn0lan> rollers
[01:45:19] <sn0lan> *lollers
[01:45:21] <rindolf> sn0lan: ah.
[01:45:38] <sn0lan> simple, turn Js off and you can go fuck
[01:59:52] <lucaszz> how to set jquery ui dialog height in '%' ?
[02:00:13] <lucaszz> for example I want to have dialog with height 80% of screen height
[02:34:21] <seutje> lucaszz: think u'd have to do the calculation yourself and also adjust it on window resize
[02:41:48] <lucaszz> seutje: I made calculation
[02:42:15] <lucaszz> seutje: And i added max-height css property to dialog div
[03:09:27] <raj> Cork, why $(document).one('click' ...? to occur once?
[03:09:47] <Cork> ?.one
[03:09:48] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[03:10:02] <raj> once per what element?
[03:10:05] <raj> the clicked element?
[03:10:16] <Cork> the event handler will only fire once
[03:10:38] <raj> and then needs to be rebound if I want a click on `document` to trigger it again?
[03:10:38] <Cork> and ex if you need it for popups or similar you bind it when the popup opens
[03:10:43] <Cork> yes
[03:11:02] <raj> hmmmmm
[03:11:39] <raj> a user is selecting multiple items, but when he/she clicks outside of the particular container, it should uncheck all those items
[03:12:11] <raj> however, there are certain privileged elements outside the container that I want to not cause an uncheck
[03:12:29] <raj> clickoutside got confusing because of those extra elements
[03:13:21] <raj> i can set the .one() thing when an item is checked, but there are multiple items checked, so they'd each call that function, unless i can check whether it's already been set
[03:13:45] <raj> *unless I can tell whether it's already been set
[03:15:36] <Cork> raj: you might need to do a more complex solution then
[03:16:31] <raj> anything in mind?
[03:16:51] <Cork> one is just a normal event listener that clears it event handler when it triggers
[03:17:08] <Cork> you would have to do something similar that handles your edge cases
[03:17:38] <fabioportieri> why jquery 1.9 does not have $.browser anymore? it is a useful feature to detect which browser is running, so that you can do browser specific code fixes
[03:18:00] <Cork> ?.supports @ fabioportieri
[03:18:03] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".supports" in jQuery Docs.
[03:18:08] <Cork> ?.support @ fabioportieri
[03:18:09] <bot-t> fabioportieri, jQuery.support: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[03:18:31] <Mento> Hey guys i'm using scrollTop - to make my element fixed, this works fine... when i scroll up again the element should be positioned static again, aint get that to work -> http://jsfiddle.net/j2ekk/
[03:19:03] <Cork> fabioportieri: ua sniffing is a bad way of handling compatibility, and feature sniffing is how it should be done
[03:19:12] <Cork> fabioportieri: that is why .browser has been removed
[03:19:54] <Cork> fabioportieri: and it is fairly simple to write tests to find if something is supported or not
[03:20:45] <fabioportieri> Cork: i don't understand.. what if a certain browser has a bug that doesn't map into a support properties?
[03:21:07] <Cork> fabioportieri: ya, that is the exception
[03:21:27] <Cork> anyway what i gave you is the reason for the removal (too much abuse)
[03:21:39] <fabioportieri> that's why i say useragent sniffing was useful
[03:21:54] <fabioportieri> and almost every script i can think of uses it
[03:22:03] <Cork> it was usefull in <1% of the times it was used
[03:22:12] <Cork> that was the big problem
[03:22:34] <Cork> the other 99+% of the times it should have been feature sniffing instead
[03:24:26] <fabioportieri> Cork: so in the best case scenario we have to map a subset of properties to a certain browser meaning "if browser x fails to property y z w then browser x = mozilla
[03:24:48] <fabioportieri> and in the worst case we can't write ua specific code
[03:24:49] <Cork> fabioportieri: no, that is wrong again
[03:25:20] <Cork> fabioportieri: if xyz results in abc, the browser needs ghi fix
[03:25:26] <Cork> that is how you SHOULD write it
[03:25:41] <fabioportieri> sorry didn't get that
[03:25:52] <eizdealer> hey guys, i'm trying jquery ajax with this simple code: $.ajax({url: '/adverts/latlong'}).fail(function(x, s, e) { console.log(s); console.log(e); });
[03:25:53] <eizdealer> the request fails with s returning 'error' and e returning nothing. i double checked that the url is correct. any suggestions what could go wrong here?
[03:26:18] <Cork> you make a test that checks for the rendering bug or similar, and then if you get the bug, the browser needs the fix
[03:26:32] <Cork> fabioportieri: you don't make a sniff for something to see if it is a specific browser
[03:26:45] <Cork> cause then your back at ua sniff again
[03:26:58] <fabioportieri> Cork: another example comes to my mind: what if a certain browser doesn't support Array.indexOf, how to check against that?
[03:27:10] <Cork> fabioportieri: the ONLY situation where ua sniff is valid, is if there is a rendering bug, that you can't test
[03:27:18] <Cork> all other bugs can use feature tests
[03:27:28] <Cork> uh
[03:27:46] <Cork> $.support.indexOf = Array.indexOf !== undefined;
[03:28:18] <fabioportieri> uhm i see
[03:28:19] <Cork> that is what feature testing means
[03:29:40] <fabioportieri> still, aren't rendering bug enough to make ua sniffing a necessary evil?
[03:29:58] <Cork> fabioportieri: well its extreamly rare
[03:30:56] <Cork> the only time i've ended up with it was in chrome 4 or something like that (display on li element's failed to render correctly until it was changed once)
[03:31:52] <Cork> if it gives any effect on the dom (ex. the parent has the wrong height, or similar, you can sniff it directly
[03:32:42] <fabioportieri> i see.. no other examples comes to my mind.. thanks for the explanation
[03:36:30] <xLambruscox> hi guys! if I create some contents of the div (by .append), assign some ids to them and then clear div by .empty, would this ids be available for addressing again?
[03:38:42] <xLambruscox> anyone here((
[03:38:54] <Onkeltem> Hi all. What is the correct pattern of creating an object B which has all properties and methofs from object A, but overrides some methods?
[03:39:18] <sacho> Onkeltem, var B = Object.create(A)
[03:42:25] <fabioportieri> what's the best wysiwyg editor regarding paste from word functionality?
[03:45:09] <|RicharD|> hi anyone know if there is a plugin for do the effect like http://codeblog.cz/creatico/index_dark.html#portfolio ?
[03:45:23] <|RicharD|> i mean the hover effect over the little images
[03:47:29] <xLambruscox> one more question: if on .ready i added jQuery('label').click(function().. and then added some label elements, will they also be linked with this onclick function or no?
[03:48:31] <sacho> no
[03:48:43] <sacho> use .on's delegation functionality
[03:49:17] <xLambruscox> thanks!!
[03:49:30] <sacho> it's important to know why it won't work
[03:50:18] <sacho> .click adds event handlers for each of the elements in the jquery selection you made - obviously any new ones you add won't be in that selection
[03:52:08] <xLambruscox> great! i'll try to read more about it now.
[03:55:51] <sfdcNoob> |RicharD|: "Inspect Element"
[03:56:17] <|RicharD|> ?
[03:56:44] <sfdcNoob> u use chrome?
[03:57:05] <sfdcNoob> |RicharD|: http://codeblog.cz/creatico/css/page.css
[03:58:05] <SCIF> Hey all.
[03:59:07] <|RicharD|> nothing of useful
[04:02:06] <rindolf> SCIF: hi.
[04:02:09] <rindolf> SCIF: what's up?
[04:02:37] <sfdcNoob> <div class="hover" style="left: 269px; top: 0px; display: none;"><span class="wrapper"><span class="content">  <img data-src="hover.png" alt="" src="themes/dark/assets/hover.png">   <h2 style="">  Some title  </h2> <p> Icons   </p>  </span></span></div>
[04:02:44] <xLambruscox> I understood... but anyway the code doesn't work. http://pastebin.com/66yz6q4h
[04:03:10] <sfdcNoob> |RicharD|: its all CSS no jquery there
[04:03:20] <|RicharD|> ah but it change
[04:03:30] <|RicharD|> the slideÖsometime from left and sometimes from top
[04:03:32] <xLambruscox> When when function js_populator walks first time all labels are clickable and change colors
[04:03:34] <sfdcNoob> you can go here #css for help
[04:03:42] <|RicharD|> i thinked it was jquery
[04:03:50] <|RicharD|> oki thx
[04:03:53] <xLambruscox> But on changing select they are not clickable
[04:07:05] <xLambruscox> the whole file is http://pastebin.com/JfBk4hUn
[04:08:54] <seutje> that indentation is so annoying to read
[04:10:58] <xLambruscox> (( i am just starting.. so have a lot of errors so to say... but ill try to improve
[04:11:46] <seutje> xLambruscox: doesn't .val() return a string?
[04:12:32] <pennismen> how is possible solve this fail: http://jsfiddle.net/EW8t7/16/
[04:13:03] <pennismen> i would like that when write (VAR LOL) = that i write and reemplace in lol AJAX
[04:13:05] <xLambruscox> this moment works ok at least... the month populates again ok, but onclick doesnt work
[04:14:30] <xLambruscox> I though first that it is because ids which I assigned to labels after emptying of div stay in memory and when I populate div again with the same labels and same ids they conflict with first
[04:16:10] <xLambruscox> so to say, I am trying to create custom TV for modx evolution with this code
[04:18:49] <seutje> xLambruscox: what onclick?
[04:19:06] <seutje> xLambruscox: I have no clue wtf this is suppose to do, but it seems to do something... http://jsfiddle.net/gU5ER/2/
[04:19:34] <seutje> it's throwing an awful lot of variables in the global scope though
[04:21:49] <xLambruscox> sorry.. I think i'll better rework all code... its very bad i suppose and it creates place for mistakes... just started working with javascript... and first I need to pertain good style of writing.. thanks a lot...
[04:33:27] <teza19> Hi, is there a way to replace this slide with fading in and out? http://pastebin.com/n7QTf8Lq
[04:35:44] <xLambruscox> so to say, if I set initial call of js_populator in the end of .ready, then labels are not clickable at all
[04:39:29] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/zC5Q6/ <-- this locks up on my website (it stops at the 2nd <li> element) but seems to work in JSFiddle. Why?
[04:40:49] <xLambruscox> oh I solved the problem
[04:42:49] <xLambruscox> I just didn't follow your first advice( I should have changed jQuery('label').on('click') to jQuery("#tvlebron-constructor").on('click', 'label',
[04:42:53] <xLambruscox> idiot((
[04:43:16] <teza19> anyone ??
[04:45:41] <SCIF> Guys, help me please. I have a noob question: http://jsfiddle.net/eE45L/
[04:53:38] <xLambruscox> I think you should form img string before inserting it in html(). it wont replace path with its contents. seems so
[04:54:56] <SCIF> xLambruscox: I used also $('img').clone().attr(‚Ä¶) but result is same
[04:56:31] <SCIF> What's the best method to insert new DOM node? Help me to build my markup awesome, please :)
[04:57:05] <xLambruscox> I use append for this but im newbie))
[04:57:59] <SCIF> append() gives same result. You can try in jsfiddle
[04:59:26] <sacho> SCIF, what does $('img') do?
[04:59:32] <xLambruscox> I also have question. I want on click on label for example save some info to some file. is it possible? maybe fire ajax request with this info to php file which will write it
[05:01:45] <sacho> sure.
[05:02:18] <SCIF> Hmmm. Only passing html string creates new dom nodes...
[05:02:50] <sacho> yes, anything other string is treated as a selector
[06:00:40] <seutje> hmz, how would I go about simulating a costly operation in JS (time-wise)
[06:03:37] <raj> seutje, http://jsperf.com/ ?
[06:03:59] <seutje> that's for comparing 2 operations
[06:04:21] <raj> oh, you want your exact operation
[06:04:55] <seutje> I was thinking something like function stall(ms) { var now = new Date().getTime(); while(true) { if ((new Date().getTime() - now) > ms) { break;} } }
[06:06:33] <seutje> basically just a loop that blocks until a certain amount of milliseconds have passed
[06:07:46] <seutje> wait, guess I could just put that condition in my while condition thingy
[06:11:21] <DarkArtist69> how can i create a page where a user inputs two numbers that are cross reference on a chart to output another number?
[06:11:40] <Niels___> i have dynamically generated breadcrumbs, they are urlEncoded. I'm trying to make them look pretty, so i'm url decoding the text with jquery, it works fine. but is this really the best way to do this? seems a bit extensive. http://pastebin.com/xFreTez5
[06:18:12] <ablomen> Niels___, you should do that on the back-end really
[06:19:18] <Niels___> ablomen: the reason for me *not* doing that, is because.. breadcrumbs are generated directly from the URI segments, which means one could pass in <script> in the breadcrumbs if it urldecoded.
[06:20:28] <ablomen> Niels___, well you should normalize it anyway, strip tags etc
[06:21:03] <Niels___> ablomen: you are probably right
[06:21:35] <ablomen> doesn't your router do that by the way, might be worth checking out?
[06:49:20] <lejocelyn> Hey, I'd like to create an input form which allows the user to either select between two values or type its own value
[06:49:32] <lejocelyn> I thought about a combobox
[06:49:39] <lejocelyn> how would you do that?
[06:49:45] <lejocelyn> (exemple : http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/06/a-jquery-ui-combobox-under-the-hood)
[06:51:53] <mazzachre> Is there some way to scroll a div when resizing an inner element to the side of that container?
[06:54:52] <mjc_> mazzachre: CSS overflow property is probably what you want https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/overflow
[06:56:18] <mjc_> mazzachre: I'm not sure I grasped exactly what you are wanting to do (late night, sorry  :( ) but almost certainly overflow: scroll will be used in the solution somewhere. could you toss up an example somewhere if you need more? perhaps jsfiddle ors omething
[07:02:18] <hirsty> hey all how would i get the form name of an opener of a window?
[07:02:38] <maloik> is .observe() something that was deprecate between 1.4.4 and 1.8.3 ? Having some toruble identifying the cause of an error
[07:03:16] <hirsty> say a button in form1 opens a new window with form2, how would i get the name of form1? (main window has multiple forms)
[07:03:29] <sacho> maloik, I don't recall that ever being part of the api
[07:04:40] <mazzachre> mjc_: Ya, I already am... I am trying to figure out how to make a "window" scroll when I "hit the border" so I can scroll further...
[07:05:20] <mjc_> mazzachre: if you make a jsfiddle or something maybe I can help
[07:10:07] <mazzachre> mjc_: http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/6/ Ya... When I resize something and hold the mouse of the purple or green bars to scroll, the resize does not work well... Like I thought...
[07:11:10] <anjen> Hi quick question regarfding improt of a ruby erb array into a javascript array. currently, the only thing I can get to make this work (arrray contains float, integer, decimal, and and text values) is var someArray = <%= some_ruby_array.json %>; but that generates an error in the html. Anyone know a simple way around it?
[07:12:19] <anjen> that is, it works, (the array is populated and javascript doesn't break), but there's an error.
[07:14:40] <josejosif> hi, how can i add tel:1233456789 to a button element? for anchor is href="tel:123456789", but what about button? im using jquerymobile 1.3.0
[07:15:19] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/6/ Anyone who can tell me why the resize does not follow the mouse when scrolling the window containing the resizable? (Try scrolling a bit right and resize the element west over the green bar...
[07:15:52] <anjen> mazzachre: have you tried adding a handle?
[07:16:03] <anjen> nvm
[07:16:12] <anjen> your code show you're using them.
[07:19:02] <josejosif> hi all
[07:19:24] <hirsty> how to get the name of element that opened a window?
[07:19:33] <anjen> mazzachre: As long as the resize is done inside the two side bars, it works fine, but the z-index you've applied to the borders dominates when the resizeable element edge is above one or the other. maybe add z-index of 100001 to the resizeable element.
[07:20:56] <ph88> var test = {'boat': {'yacht', 'sail'},  'vehicle': {'truck', 'motor'} }  I would like to traverse like this: yacht, sail, truck, motor   and have the key of the "upper" array available: boat, vehicle
[07:21:39] <anjen> hirsty, if $('.foo') opened it, then $('.foo').attr('name') will retrieve the name.
[07:22:24] <ph88> why doesn't work like this ?? http://pastebin.com/ZKjBm7Yu
[07:24:15] <josejosif> how can i add tel:1233456789 to a button element? for anchor is href="tel:123456789", but what about button? im using jquerymobile 1.3.0
[07:24:24] <ph88> sorry line 3 needs to be  modelValue + ' - ' + makeKey   but then still doesn't work ...
[07:25:32] <anjen> josejosif: hmm...well, maybe, if you're using ruby or such, you can place the tel href in a helpeer, then use that to populate the button text
[07:26:42] <josejosif> anjen, im usijng php, but that doesnt matter, atm im testing with plain html+jquerymobile
[07:28:21] <ph88> anjen:   .attr('href', 'tel:'+'123456789')  ?
[07:28:24] <anjen> if the telephone number is jsut a simple value, then jsut use it as the button text. If you mean a hotlink within the button, I have no idea
[07:28:36] <anjen> ph88 yeah something like that
[07:28:52] <ph88> what you mean something like that ? that's what you want isn't it
[07:28:57] <mazzachre> anjen: But then, will it scroll while the mouse is above?
[07:29:23] <anjen> ph88 no I don't want that. I asked a different quesitn a ways back and got caught in the "flow" of other posts
[07:29:32] <josejosif> ph88, and anjen , thanks i'll try to add href on <button>
[07:29:55] <anjen> mazzachre: it should, as long as you're outside it's frame of influence
[07:30:07] <ph88> i meant to highlight josejosif
[07:30:22] <anjen> try it. jsut tack on the z-index and repost the fiddle
[07:30:26] <ph88> anyway someone want to help me out traversing 2D object ?
[07:30:31] <mazzachre> anjen: Nopes, it does not... It will scroll nicely, but the element does not resize beyond what it could before the scroll...
[07:30:45] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/7/
[07:31:25] <hirsty> anjen: it could be opened by multiple elements
[07:31:35] <anjen> mazzachre: oh...I see. that in part is due to the jsfiddle page border being "hard"
[07:32:17] <Gho5t> anyone know of a "maxlength" shim for IE 9
[07:32:24] <Gho5t> yes I googled
[07:32:52] <anjen> hirsty. I understand. Sorry, that's the way I'd do it. I don't go for the universal solutions, as my work tends to require quick changes
[07:33:37] <anjen> If I had a group of elements I wanted to "monitor" I'd give them all a class name so they can be parsed'
[07:43:03] <mazzachre> anjen: OK, so I can't really do anything about it?
[07:44:33] <anjen> well, not in jsfiddle. I'm not sure you can expand the frame work without adding more code that increases the containing div/etc when the element inside wants to be bigger than the container. anjen ain't no ninja, just a hack ;)
[07:45:56] <mazzachre> anjen :) LOL... well... I can try and work with adding more size to the div when scrolling... That might work...
[07:46:04] <anjen> that is, you'd have to monitor the size of the element being expanded, and when it approaches the size of its container, add width to the container, if you see what I eman. But I'm not exactly sure how you'd accomplish that anyway, or indeed if it can be. Probably can, but I'm not quite sure
[07:46:12] <anjen> yeah exactly
[07:46:19] <anjen> good luck mazzachre !
[07:47:17] <mazzachre> thx
[07:47:27] <tra_> any ideas why $.load is not performing a xhr request and just doing a normal page load?
[07:47:35] <anjen> sorry I didn't have the quickfix you were hoping for :(
[07:47:51] <ph88> should i be able to access variable outside of an $.each closure ?
[07:47:53] <tra_> working fine on my localhost, but on clients dev-server the $.load is just doing a normal page load
[07:48:12] <fabioportieri> http://pastebin.com/3MqTBLeR
[07:49:06] <fabioportieri> any help with redactor? ^^
[07:49:22] <anjen> ph88: I'm not sure myuself, but google provided this link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12309264/jquery-each-closure-how-to-access-outside-variable
[07:50:37] <ph88> anjen:  thx, i saw that link though ... wasn't able to fix my problem with it
[07:51:32] <ph88> jsfiddle tomorrow i guess :/
[07:51:51] <anjen> ok one more try. Anyone jknow how to remedy a javascript error when importing a ~complex ruby array into a javascript array? I can make it work with var fooArray=<%= ruby_arry.json %>; but it still generates a (non destructive) error
[07:52:07] <anjen> well it was worth a try anyway ph88.
[07:52:27] <ph88> yes thx, here is my code anyway ... http://pastebin.com/3YxueaG3
[07:53:03] <ilteris_> hey guys, is there a way to make the form submit on press Enter key here at the top of the page? http://www.smrxt.com/
[07:53:05] <xec_> anjen: what is the error? and what does the generated code look like?
[07:53:34] <ilteris_> do I need jquery for this?
[07:54:13] <anjen> xec: everything works fine when I use the format shown above, but there's an error in my ide. hold on, I'm booting my server now
[07:55:17] <maxwell_> I have a menu and each link is opened with a modal dialog. Im trying to avoid creating the same dialog everytime i click a link more than one time.. what can i change here http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/4/ ?
[07:56:58] <fabioportieri> nevermind, solved
[07:57:38] <xec_> anjen: it's unlikely i can shed any light on your IDE error, never having used one for ruby :)
[07:57:58] <anjen> fair enough xec. thanks anyway
[07:58:21] <Tulip> Hi, I want to replace the text inside caption class with the array I have defined here is code the http://jsfiddle.net/49atU/2/ can anyone help please
[07:59:45] <anjen> xec, it looks like it's jsut some bug in the IDE anyway. no error in the actual output
[07:59:59] <anjen> sorry for the red herring
[08:00:41] <gazzwi86> I'm having an issue using jquery mobile in the actual jquery mobile file.  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined  Line 2

[08:02:55] <shomon> hi, how do I substitute the value of one form element for another?
[08:03:11] <shomon> $('input[name="username"]').val($('input[name="#emailaddress"]').val()) <-- that's what I came up with and it doesn't work
[08:04:08] <rindolf> shomon: can you try it using a JS debugger such as Firebug?
[08:04:21] <shomon> yep
[08:04:21] <rindolf> shomon: and debug where it goes wrong?
[08:04:33] <shomon> it doesn't make an error
[08:04:51] <shomon> it just doesn't substitute the value, so as it's a very newb question maybe I just don't know how to substitute values in jquery
[08:05:22] <fikst> Tulip, http://jsfiddle.net/49atU/3/
[08:05:40] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/49atU/5/
[08:05:40] <Z3R0> there
[08:06:34] <didiergm> Tulip you've got several issues : .caption will not select one <p> but all of them, so you cannot address each element individually with a class, you need a id (or a different class for each individual element
[08:06:44] <Z3R0> didiergm wrong
[08:06:51] <Z3R0> shomon look at my example
[08:07:01] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/49atU/5/ substitutes :)
[08:07:17] <didiergm> Z3R0 in what way ?
[08:07:29] <Z3R0> you can .each each caption class
[08:07:33] <shomon> thanks Z3R0 just looking!
[08:07:51] <Z3R0> $('.class').each(function(index)) { $(this) == current class object }
[08:08:14] <didiergm> Z3R0 had you looked at Tulip's fiddle you'd have seen there was no .each; take it one step @ a time
[08:08:40] <Z3R0> sorry didn't realize you were responding to Tulip my bad, haha
[08:08:44] <shomon> so say I have an input with name "username" containing "john" and I want this value to end up in another input called "email"...
[08:09:04] <didiergm> so Tulip U there ?
[08:09:09] <Z3R0> $('#email').val($('#username').val());
[08:09:29] <Z3R0> although, I prefer to store values like that in variable for easier readability lol
[08:09:39] <shomon> aah you don't need input[]
[08:09:43] <Z3R0> user = $('#username').val();
[08:09:48] <shomon> thanks!
[08:10:47] <Tulip> didiergm: Oh yes I got it
[08:11:07] <Tulip> Z3R0: and fikst thanks
[08:11:13] <Z3R0> :)
[08:11:34] <Z3R0> hmmm actually
[08:11:42] <fikst> np, but Z3R0 has a better solution :)
[08:12:02] <Z3R0> didiergm I didn't notice but Tulip's code works he just didn't have jquery loaded in the fiddle lol
[08:12:42] <Z3R0> sorry fikst's lol
[08:12:47] <Tulip> Do anyone one knows why this .split(/\n/) doesn't respond correctly as it does in other browser
[08:12:51] <Z3R0> god I I am blah today
[08:13:09] <Z3R0> I'm assuming \n for new line ?
[08:13:13] <didiergm> Z3RO, Agreed it DOES something, not sure that was the intention though :)
[08:13:19] <Tulip> yes right
[08:13:21] <Z3R0> didiergm me either really
[08:13:33] <Z3R0> I believe some browsers recognize \n while others like \n\r
[08:13:34] <Z3R0> or something
[08:14:29] <Tulip> in mozila crome it results item1, item2, item3 in this format but in IE8(Specially) it results item1 item2 item3
[08:14:32] <didiergm> fikst your solution works but would'nt it be very expensive ?
[08:14:55] <Z3R0> yea, I think fikst's is a bit overkill
[08:15:13] <Z3R0> I still don't really see the purpose in it though
[08:15:23] <Z3R0> I mean, what the OP was actually trying to achieve (as to why)
[08:15:40] <didiergm> Rather elegant, could have it's use, never thought of using .eq(x) but not in a loop
[08:16:12] <didiergm> OP wanted to remplace the content of consecutive paragraphes, all sharing class caption with the content of an array
[08:16:13] <fikst> yes, its expensive and, also expects the array to have the same amount of values as there are .caption
[08:16:28] <Z3R0> fikst so does mine sadly
[08:16:45] <Z3R0> because if there's a caption index that doesn't refer to the array index (it will fail as well)
[08:16:45] <fikst> I think it would be ok if jQuery('.caption') is stored in a var outside the for loop
[08:16:54] <fikst> but still, not the best solution
[08:17:01] <Z3R0> I think honestly, it would be better to actaully just append the entire <p></p> for each array element
[08:17:19] <fikst> I just did it to keep the for loop over the store items
[08:17:35] <didiergm> the way I would do it. (if # of <p> known) have id=id0, id=id1, on each <p> and loop. fast and ugly but fast :)
[08:17:39] <Z3R0> that way there's no chance of there being any missing indexes
[08:18:11] <didiergm> true
[08:19:56] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/49atU/7/ // something like that
[08:20:30] <Tulip> Z3R0: thanks a lot
[08:27:35] <Tulip> actually I was looking for caption to be loaded in IE8 as it does with other browsers http://screencast.com/t/b9BGjkJjUbhC here is a code I have used http://pastebin.com/47sNndWT and if you visit this site in IE8 and in any other browser, Caption area shows undefined in IE8 please help
[08:28:03] <Tulip> http://www.computereverything.net/staging/ here is the site
[08:29:28] <Tulip> Z3R0: Can you help with this
[08:33:05] <Nobita> hey, this is my JS code http://pastebin.com/hetvEz3T I'm having trouble if I'm trying to neat the code I'm not getting the output may I know why? Thanks
[08:42:47] <AdamPDotty> define "output"
[08:43:48] <AdamPDotty> You should be aware that the last two commands are not dependent on the ternary operator
[08:51:58] <shomon> I'm still unable to substitute a form element value with the contents of another form element - is there a way to tell if the values are being picked up correctly?
[09:08:22] <ddsss> why when jqurey ui tooltip opens  - that changes the height of my page?
[09:16:58] <spobat> hi
[09:16:59] <spobat> is there an easier way of doing this comparison?
[09:17:05] <spobat> http://ideone.com/I7uWOw
[09:18:11] <Snwspeckle> When a user clicks the edit button, I get the ID of the row the button was selected in and I perform a _GET to a PHP script. After that script completes, I want to refresh another PHP page with HTML in it. How would I do this?
[09:18:44] <momomomomo> Snwspeckle: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:23:56] <Snwspeckle> momomomomo: Can I reload a PHP page I have included with ajax?
[09:24:36] <Snwspeckle> My current AJAX request does "location.reload(true);" which refreshes the current page but I want to refresh another page which I have included already instead of the whole entire page
[09:24:42] <momomomomo> Snwspeckle: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1510011/how-does-ajax-work
[09:26:36] <Snwspeckle> momomomomo: http://jsfiddle.net/acbmC/1/ --- This is what I'm working on now but the issue is that the page is reloading but the modal, bootstrap component, isn't being displayed after the reload
[09:27:00] <didiergm> spobat nort that I know of
[09:27:08] <spobat> ok
[09:27:17] <spobat> what's "nort"?
[09:28:31] <momomomomo> Snwspeckle: I'm sorry but that's a specific problem that sounds kind of sticky - I have a meeting in about 1 minute here; hopefully someone else can help. I'd check your new page's source file to make sure tha tall the bootstrap components you need are being sent during the refresh.
[09:28:40] <tech_> channel for dot net?
[09:29:36] <Snwspeckle> They are being presented but I think javascript doesn't wait for the reload to finish before presenting the modal, thus the modal is presented but the reload removes it before the user sees it
[09:29:59] <tech_> channel for dot net  technology?
[09:32:54] <fllr> Hey guys, I'm using $.get to fetch some data for me. The request goes through fine, and I get a status 200 back from it, except the file comes back empty (even though the file I'm pulling is not empty). Why is it doing that?

[09:59:20] <schofld> hi
[09:59:46] <schofld> does anyone know how i could compile my entire site
[09:59:55] <schofld> the javascript and HTML and Css
[10:02:25] <Andrew_R> compile it into what?
[10:02:45] <pachet> Andrew_R: speak not its name
[10:03:17] <schofld> well so you end upwith something like google.com
[10:03:44] <schofld> all coments removed and spaces it all just becomes on line of code
[10:03:53] <et09> i have a bunch of UNIX-formatted timestamps, denotating the start and end of a period of time
[10:04:11] <et09> i need to chart them..preferably with javascript...so as to show, how many sessions were running at x point in time, based on the full range of time used
[10:04:16] <et09> any good jquery plugins to do this?
[10:04:22] <schofld> and to do the same with all the css, html and js with just a simple terminal program
[10:05:10] <et09> or am i going to have to manually go through the data to do that myself, server-side...
[10:05:13] <Andrew_R> schofld: what you ware looking for is called "minification"
[10:05:39] <Andrew_R> schofld: it reformats your files to remove comments and spaces
[10:06:19] <vatzec> Hi. I have some HTML returned by AJAX that I want to parse using jQuery (find the number of <li> tags inside the returned HTML). How can I do this?
[10:06:38] <vatzec> The HTML is not yet inside the actual document, but rather in a variable.
[10:07:21] <et09> maybe i can say that better - need to chart number of users per time with a javascript/jquery plugin
[10:07:26] <et09> based on session start and end data
[10:07:31] <schofld> Andrew_R: well in that case minification program that can be called from the terminal that would minify the entire site and not one js file at a time
[10:08:38] <Andrew_R> There are some that do that. I don't have a recommendation though. I use Visual Studio extensions that do it automatically for me.
[10:08:49] <Andrew_R> but now that you know what you're looking for, it should be easier to find :)
[10:10:35] <DarsVaeda> is _on an internal jquery function?
[10:11:16] <sacho> nope, and that's trivial to test.
[10:11:42] <DarsVaeda> how?
[10:11:53] <sacho> search the source
[10:12:01] <didiergm> schofld if you find something that does what you want, I would be very interested too. VS is not an option for me sa I am running on Linux
[10:12:07] <DarsVaeda> I did, thats why I ask
[10:12:11] <throstur> When a user clicks on a "Like" link, how can I extract the id of the element that the user clicked on?
[10:12:37] <sacho> .attr('id')
[10:12:38] <dcherman> didiergm: schofld:  look into grunt.js.  has tasks for doing everything you're talking about.
[10:12:55] <throstur> but sacho, .attr goes to what?
[10:13:06] <throstur> self.attr()?
[10:13:15] <didiergm> dcherman thanks I guess it needs node.js setup I'll give it a go
[10:13:48] <DarsVaeda> ahh seems to be a jqueryui function
[10:14:33] <sacho> in an event handler, this usually refers to the element that the event has been fired on
[10:15:33] <throstur> thanks
[10:17:01] <throstur> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'attr'
[10:17:06] <throstur> Am I missing something?
[10:17:47] <say2joe> sure are‚Ä¶ a jquery object wrapper
[10:18:09] <say2joe> you're trying to call attr() on an actual DOMElement, not jquery object.
[10:18:39] <throstur> ah I see
[10:19:06] <throstur> I should be using getAttribute('id') then
[10:19:32] <say2joe> or just <DOMElement>.id would also work. Since, you're going for id.
[10:20:01] <sacho> quite true
[10:20:03] <say2joe> some attributes are always available (ex, "id") when an element is created. Those are fairly safe to reference without a getter.
[10:20:22] <say2joe> they may however have a null value
[10:20:33] <say2joe> or empty string

[10:43:01] <b-ot> starman`: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:46:40] <Z3R0> fulminator: like that? http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/9/
[10:47:04] <Snwspeckle> I am trying to get the data from my JSON response and set my input fields with it but its null. Any ideas why?
[10:47:04] <Snwspeckle> http://jsfiddle.net/kXQSB/
[10:47:32] <Z3R0> can you console.log(data) before you parse it ?
[10:47:36] <Z3R0> does it show that there is info ?
[10:48:00] <Snwspeckle> I'm getting the data
[10:48:15] <Z3R0> and just curious why are you using javascript and jquery methods?
[10:48:26] <Snwspeckle> Its a very long story haha
[10:48:29] <Snwspeckle> Its impossible to explain it
[10:48:34] <Z3R0> document.getElementById('editFirstName').value = data.firstName; vs $('#editFirstName').val(data.firstName); lol
[10:48:44] <Z3R0> ok well...
[10:48:51] <Z3R0> so you get data?
[10:48:55] <Snwspeckle> yup
[10:48:57] <Z3R0> but after you parse it it returns empty ?
[10:49:04] <Z3R0> can you paste the two responses?
[10:49:07] <Z3R0> before and after?
[10:50:05] <Snwspeckle> Now I removed my getElement and changed to what you did, the modal where my form is shows now but the data isn't being populated into the input fields
[10:52:04] <Z3R0> well yea, we still gotta figure out what's up with your data
[10:52:06] <fulminator> Z3R0: it doesn't works
[10:52:09] <Z3R0> was just curious
[10:52:16] <Z3R0> yea fulminator I figured out what you were trying to achieve
[10:52:18] <Z3R0> testing more
[10:52:27] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/10/ // try that?
[10:53:03] <Z3R0> I added your if (checkCorrelation) to the draggable stop even of the "ball"
[10:53:09] <fulminator> whoaw
[10:53:09] <Snwspeckle> Z3RO: Heres my JSON response http://codepad.org/0HedXdyd
[10:53:12] <fulminator> that fast?
[10:53:19] <fulminator> thanks Z3R0 the man
[10:53:23] <fulminator> :D
[10:53:52] <Z3R0> wait... Snwspeckle
[10:53:56] <Z3R0> are you returning json from php ?
[10:54:00] <Snwspeckle> Yes
[10:54:07] <Z3R0> then why are you parsing it  again ?
[10:54:13] <Snwspeckle> oh..
[10:54:22] <Snwspeckle> So I can remove JSON.parse
[10:54:25] <Z3R0> yep
[10:54:32] <Z3R0> JSON.parse would be if you were returning an array from php
[10:54:43] <fulminator> Z3R0: but can I check for correlation with an exterior function?
[10:54:45] <Z3R0> and not doing a 'JSON' request
[10:54:49] <Snwspeckle> Ok so then how would I fetch the keys inside the JSON?
[10:54:55] <Z3R0> same way
[10:55:00] <Snwspeckle> data.firstName?
[10:55:06] <Z3R0> yep
[10:55:09] <fulminator> can I check if a specific div got dropped on another specific div with an exterior function?
[10:55:13] <Z3R0> data because your json object
[10:55:15] <Snwspeckle> My input values aren't updating still
[10:55:19] <Z3R0> you just remove that var data = line
[10:55:22] <Snwspeckle> Ok we'll hmm
[10:55:29] <Snwspeckle> I removed that line, still no data
[10:55:44] <Z3R0> console.log(data.firstName)
[10:55:45] <Z3R0> ;
[10:55:52] <Z3R0> make sure that's working lol
[10:55:56] <Z3R0> hmmmm fulminator
[10:56:05] <Snwspeckle> undefined lol, whyyyy
[10:56:06] <Snwspeckle> haha
[10:56:15] <Z3R0> can you show me your php response ?
[10:56:20] <Z3R0> like... the code itself
[10:56:33] <Z3R0> are you doing something like json_encode($array); ?
[10:56:52] <Snwspeckle> http://pastebin.com/jE6BcBWK
[10:57:05] <Z3R0> ah ok
[10:57:13] <Z3R0> in ajax
[10:57:18] <Z3R0> do dataType: 'json',
[10:57:40] <Snwspeckle> Ok
[10:57:52] <fulminator> Z3R0: the functions makeFace() and makeToy() are suppose to be used several times for different divs; that's why I need an exterior function to check that and I can't have code withing .draggable area
[10:58:02] <Z3R0> right
[10:58:05] <fulminator> :D
[10:58:06] <Z3R0> I see what you're saying
[10:58:07] <Snwspeckle> Z3RO: I did data.firstName and I got the name now
[10:58:12] <Z3R0> woot ;)
[10:58:18] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[10:58:25] <Snwspeckle> Now its just about getting the data into the input fields :)
[10:58:29] <Z3R0> so basically you need ot be able to trigger the function and pass it the two divs...
[10:58:39] <Z3R0> $('#id').val(data.firstName); should populate
[10:59:01] <Z3R0> function checkCorrelation(droppableFace, droppedToy) { // fulminator which is what you are attempting
[10:59:17] <Snwspeckle> I am trying to load the data into inputs, is what your doing only work with divs?
[10:59:23] <Snwspeckle> Im new to AJAX fyi
[10:59:37] <Snwspeckle> the first name input has a name="editFirstName"
[10:59:38] <Z3R0> should work fine with inputs
[10:59:41] <Z3R0> ah
[10:59:45] <Z3R0> make it id="editFirstName"
[10:59:52] <Z3R0> and name="editFirstName"
[10:59:55] <Z3R0> name = for serialization
[10:59:58] <Z3R0> id = for identification
[11:00:02] <Snwspeckle> ok
[11:00:06] <Z3R0> so do both
[11:00:11] <Snwspeckle> it works, YES
[11:00:14] <Z3R0> woot ;0
[11:00:14] <Snwspeckle> I <3 u
[11:00:53] <Z3R0> working on fulminator
[11:00:54] <Cork> if anyone here is using slidedeck, your slideshow is most likely broken in current firefox (just so you know)
[11:01:01] <Z3R0> the problem is going to be how to get the "other div"
[11:01:07] <Z3R0> getting the current draggable toy (this) is easy
[11:01:18] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=860380
[11:01:18] <fulminator> yes; function checkCorrelation should ckeck if 2 specific div are 'touching' (if one is dropped on the other) and if true do something. it's like button, the button works fine, but you must press it to work. I need the function that does that automatically when div is dropped
[11:01:35] <Z3R0> question will know you "which" divs that toy cannot touch prior to creation ?
[11:01:52] <Z3R0> right you need the trigger type scenario
[11:01:58] <Z3R0> but dynamically
[11:02:25] <fulminator> I can't really know what you are asking :) and I am new to ui
[11:02:58] <Z3R0> well, like right now in your "playGame"
[11:03:02] <Z3R0> you have create(dan)
[11:03:05] <Z3R0> create(football)
[11:03:07] <Z3R0> 2 div's
[11:03:18] <Z3R0> so you already know the correlation you want, is between dan,football
[11:03:19] <fulminator> yes
[11:03:23] <fulminator> and mayby more items
[11:03:26] <fulminator> yes
[11:03:26] <Z3R0> but I'm assuming you will have many more divs
[11:03:31] <fulminator> the correlations are in pair
[11:03:38] <fulminator> each div correspond to another div
[11:03:42] <fulminator> this is known from the start
[11:03:46] <Z3R0> and will it be a static
[11:03:47] <Z3R0> ah ok
[11:03:48] <Z3R0> perfect
[11:03:56] <fulminator> dan gets a football; marie gets a doll
[11:04:01] <Z3R0> that's what I was lokoing for
[11:04:25] <throstur> can I do $("#curID")... where curID is a var?
[11:04:48] <shoky> $("#" + curID)

[11:05:19] <Z3R0> just pass the parent when you create the toy
[11:05:27] <Z3R0> to add teh parent to the draggable event checker :)

[11:27:07] <Krambiorix> hi in an iframe i open a new window. In that window i want to get the value of an input box in the window opener's parent frame... How can i do that?
[11:27:31] <Krambiorix> i tried : $("#currentuserid",window.opener.document) and $("#currentuserid",window.opener.document.parent) but that doesn't work...
[11:28:38] <Cork> $(window.opener).contents().find('#currentuserid')
[11:30:00] <Cork> not sure where parent comes into it all though
[11:30:12] <Cork> ah
[11:30:35] <Cork> Krambiorix: you want to get the parent of the iframe from inside the popup?
[11:31:35] <Krambiorix> Cork yes
[11:32:25] <Cork> hmm one min i will have to dig a bit
[11:32:51] <Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726816/how-to-write-this-in-jquery-window-parent-document-getelementbyidparentprice
[11:32:55] <Z3R0> $('#parentPrice', window.parent.document).html();
[11:33:11] <Cork> Z3R0: its one more step
[11:33:18] <Cork> its opener and parent
[11:33:32] <Z3R0> why would you need opener?
[11:33:43] <Cork> cause its from a popup
[11:33:49] <Cork> window.open
[11:33:53] <Z3R0> ah
[11:34:00] <Z3R0> so it's a new "browser page as well"
[11:34:32] <Cork> you need to get the inner window element from opener
[11:34:35] <Cork> and from there get parent
[11:34:48] <Cork> and that is what i'm looking into right now
[11:35:05] <Z3R0> right two step process?
[11:35:28] <Z3R0> window.opener.$("#serverMsg")
[11:35:36] <Z3R0> that should give you the element from within the opener
[11:35:45] <Cork> no
[11:35:54] <Cork> $ will point to the current document
[11:36:02] <Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2167455/how-to-access-parent-window-object-using-jquery
[11:37:28] <Krambiorix> Z3R0, yeah but the popup is opened from within an iframe, or doesn't make that any difference?
[11:37:37] <Z3R0> could you not do something like myWindow = window.opener; parent = myWindow.parent;
[11:38:34] <Z3R0> I thin kthe problem we are having isnm't with window.opener, but it's retrieving that in relation to be able to access the parent from that element right ?
[11:39:31] <Cork> Krambiorix: $(window.opener.parent.document).find('#currentuserid').val()
[11:39:32] <fonko> guys how do i select a div whenever i ckick the inside div?
[11:39:34] <Cork> that works

[11:40:42] <aFeijo> in a group of DIV, if I click one, I need to fadeOut all sibilings, I try with $(this).sibilings().fadeOut()  where is my error?
[11:40:49] <fonko> i mean
[11:40:50] <Cork> fonko: what is the context of the question?
[11:40:57] <fonko> ok
[11:41:00] <Cork> you giving a bit too little information
[11:41:03] <Z3R0> aFeijo can you create the fiddle please
[11:41:27] <Krambiorix> Cork, that's it!
[11:41:28] <fonko> i have one div with another div inside... whenever i click the div inside i need to do something with its father
[11:41:35] <Z3R0> ah
[11:41:40] <Z3R0> $(this).parent()
[11:41:43] <Krambiorix> Cork : $(window.opener.parent.document).find('#currentuserid').val() --> works (and great too)
[11:41:47] <Krambiorix> thanks!!!
[11:41:52] <Cork> np :)
[11:42:03] <Z3R0> fonko: var father = $(this).parent();
[11:42:04] <fonko> but when i go for $(this).parent().something() it does with the whole page
[11:42:10] <fonko> mmm its weird
[11:42:13] <fonko> its not working
[11:42:17] <Z3R0> what are you trying to do to the father ?
[11:42:21] <fonko> let me try to paste the code
[11:42:25] <fonko> flip the father
[11:42:36] <Cork> fonko: is the outer div a direct parent of the inner div?
[11:42:36] <fonko> its a flip plugint that im trying to add
[11:42:44] <Z3R0> flip ?
[11:42:55] <fonko> what do you mean by direct parent
[11:42:56] <Cork> and are you sure you're actually targeting the inner div when you start?
[11:43:00] <fonko> let me paste the code

[11:44:44] <fonko> now im in true problems haha
[11:44:51] <fonko> siblings?
[11:44:52] <Z3R0> just post the code
[11:44:54] <Z3R0> we'll help yea
[11:45:18] <Cork> fonko: $(this).prevAll('div').last()
[11:45:28] <Cork> or nextAll('di'
[11:45:30] <Cork> opps
[11:45:36] <fonko> interesting
[11:45:37] <Z3R0> let's seet he code first Cork lol
[11:45:37] <Cork> or nextAll('div').first() if its after
[11:48:29] <fonko> http://pastebin.com/1i3WV02X
[11:49:03] <fonko> whenever i click feed_share_link div i need to apply the flip effect to the whole thing
[11:49:09] <fonko> inbetween the "a"
[11:49:50] <Cork> is it ok to flip the a too?
[11:49:53] <fonko> www.goesenlinea.com/pruebainpulse/
[11:50:04] <fonko> i dont know :$
[11:50:17] <Cork> or do you need to flip all the divs in the a, or just the col2.row1 div?
[11:50:32] <fonko> col2.row1 div i think
[11:50:44] <fonko> but those "col2.row1" are variables
[11:50:58] <Cork> $(this).next().<your flip command>
[11:51:04] <Cork> bah sorry
[11:51:09] <Cork> $(this).prev().<your flip command>
[11:51:27] <damasceno> Hello, Anyone here can help me with Bootstrap CSS and HTML? I'm trying to put in the same line an input text and a select box but something is wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/6CpUt/
[11:51:33] <Cork> though that will depend on there not being anything inbetween the two divs
[11:51:45] <fonko> let me try that Cork
[11:51:57] <Cork> $(this).prevAll('div').last() is a bit safer
[11:52:20] <fonko> that goes one up and then picks the last div?
[11:52:21] <fonko> sounds great
[11:52:58] <Cork> fonko: no it finds all divs before the current one (in the same parent)
[11:53:16] <Cork> and then it grabs the last one of them (the one closest to the feed_share_link div)
[11:54:14] <fonko> nice
[11:54:46] <thorie> how do i remove all <b> tags without removing their content? no matter how deeply nested they are?
[11:54:53] <fonko> but its not working
[11:55:32] <Bish> are there any events that get triggered when XHR is done? like "load" of document?
[11:55:54] <eddiemonge> why does everyone always come here for help with bootstrap?
[11:56:19] <masentinel900> Guys !!
[11:56:27] <masentinel900> Afternoon everybody!!
[11:56:32] <eddiemonge> what about women?
[11:56:52] <sacho> maybe they're only interested in guys.
[11:56:55] <masentinel900> I need to know exactly what is the difference between $.post and $.ajax
[11:57:09] <pachet> $.post is a convenience wrapper around $.ajax
[11:57:27] <pachet> google is happy to answer questions like this, btw
[11:57:33] <pachet> ?.post()
[11:57:34] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:57:35] <Cork> dama..
[11:57:42] <Cork> sigh i hate ppl that can't wait...
[11:58:59] <masentinel900> Thanks
[12:12:15] <jtm> how would I remove objects that look like <object id="controller_RANDOM_TEXT_HERE">...</object>
[12:12:34] <jtm> i.e. a pattern match
[12:12:41] <jtm> to anything that is controller_* for the id
[12:13:41] <Cork> jtm: if you have a choice you shouldn't be doing that
[12:13:55] <Cork> you can't pattern match an id; you can treat the id as a normal attribute though
[12:14:24] <Cork> $('object[id^="controller_"]')
[12:15:30] <Cork> the correct way to solve it would be to add classes to to the objects instead, and use that for selection
[12:15:53] <noregret> i got <div target>....what...<div start> how can I get 'target' being in 'start', note that target and start and whatever between them  are siblings. how can i use .prev() here
[12:16:27] <noregret> between the two, there is a random number of elements
[12:16:42] <Cork> noregret: you mean target is an attribute?
[12:16:58] <noregret> Cork: no, i mean target as a div
[12:17:19] <jtm> Cork I have no control over adding classes to it, it's left over by a library, I just want to cleanup the flash
[12:17:33] <Cork> jtm: ya, thought so
[12:17:43] <jtm> $('object[id^="controller_"]')  This will match all of them?
[12:17:44] <Cork> jtm: could sniff it in the way you asked the question :)
[12:17:47] <Cork> yes
[12:18:02] <Cork> noregret: you need to me a bit more specific in the question then
[12:18:02] <jtm> ok, I thought there was a wildcard I needed or something
[12:18:14] <Cork> noregret: preferably a jsfiddle
[12:18:22] <kristofers> I have a site where in mobile size, it shows a dropdown menu instead of the navigation bar, and i'm trying to save the selected value of the dropdown on the next page
[12:18:29] <Cork> jtm: you can't use wildcards in selectors
[12:19:02] <eddiemonge> noregret: siblings() ?
[12:19:38] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/hS89P/
[12:19:55] <kristofers> everything works perfectly when i comment out the window.location
[12:20:42] <Cork> Krinkle: location = .val will cancel the form submission
[12:20:47] <kristofers> even if before ?
[12:20:51] <Cork> as your leaving the page
[12:21:19] <kristofers> i'm saving the value in a session, and retrieving it
[12:21:19] <Cork> yes, as the browser won't even have enough time to start opening the connection before you set location
[12:21:27] <kristofers> what options do i have ?
[12:21:34] <noregret> eddiemonge: perfect! =)
[12:21:45] <[1]fonko> fo/me
[12:21:48] <[1]fonko> sorry haha
[12:21:53] <Cork> kristofers: is submit triggering ajax?
[12:22:04] <kristofers> no
[12:22:11] <kristofers> just php form
[12:22:14] <Cork> then why not let the server set the url?
[12:22:23] <kristofers> saving the $_POSt value into a $_SESSION
[12:22:30] <Z3R0> yea let the server redirect
[12:22:56] <Krinkle> Cork: mis-tab?
[12:23:12] <fonko> why i suddenly had my nick renamed to [1]fonko ?
[12:23:14] <Cork> Krinkle: yes
[12:23:59] <Cork> fonko: forgot to identify for your nick possibly?
[12:27:01] <kristofers> Did you guys mean using header() ?
[12:27:19] <Cork> yes
[12:27:25] <kristofers> thing is, it's a wordpress website and i'm posting it to the same page
[12:27:42] <Cork> so?
[12:28:15] <Cork> actually is location and the form target the same url?
[12:29:30] <kristofers> <form id="myform" name="myform" action="" method="post">
[12:29:34] <kristofers> the dropdown is on every page
[12:29:56] <Cork> kristofers: what prevents you from submiting to the new location?
[12:30:25] <Cork> $('#myform').attr('action', $(this).val()).submit()
[12:30:26] <kristofers> my brain i guess, need some sleep..
[12:31:33] <fonko> yes Cork that was the issue, now i have indentified myself
[12:31:48] <fonko> hey what does it means when you set a 0 inside show() ? (show(0))
[12:32:05] <Cork> fonko: basically same as calling show()
[12:32:19] <Cork> show takes a animation time (ms) as an argument
[12:32:30] <Cork> ?.show @ fonko
[12:32:31] <bot-t> fonko, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[12:34:15] <kristofers> Cork: thanks !
[12:37:05] <Krambiorix> Is it possible to check if currently i'm in a popup window or the main browser window?
[12:37:36] <seutje> Krambiorix: what do u mean by a popup window?
[12:37:51] <Z3R0> new window
[12:37:52] <Z3R0> _blank
[12:37:54] <Z3R0> _new
[12:37:55] <seutje> like a modal or an actual window?
[12:38:13] <Z3R0> seutje he means new browser window
[12:38:54] <Krambiorix> seutje,  a _blank window
[12:38:57] <Krambiorix> yes
[12:39:04] <sqpat17> hi, im having some weird issues with bind/unbind. I regularly unbind/bind a function to a click event on an element when i want to enable/disable interaction. Unbind works, but every successive bind call seems to attach the function one more time than before so it starts to fire 2, 3, 4, etc times after that many unbind/bind cycles
[12:39:32] <sqpat17> the element selector is an id and i can confirm theres only one element responding to that selector
[12:39:36] <eddiemonge> sqpat17: are you unbinding the the bound handler or some random one?
[12:39:41] <wachpwnski> Is there a way I can pop a table to toggle showing say 10 rows to like 50?
[12:39:54] <sqpat17> its the same handler every time i call bind or unbind
[12:40:08] <sqpat17>     $("#soundCheckbox").unbind(whichClickEvent()).bind(whichClickEvent(), toggleSound)
[12:40:21] <seutje> hm... no clue tbh
[12:40:21] <sqpat17> (whichClickEvent() is deterministic depending on platform)
[12:40:26] <eddiemonge> sqpat17: have you tried namespaced events?
[12:40:30] <JelmerD> Guys, I am having a little issue whil developing a plugin voor jQuery. I have a onChange callback set, and it works fine. It gets triggered on the right moment and does the job. But, now I would like to pass an argument to this callback, my curValue. How do I do this so I can use it like: $('.class').plugin({callback: function(curVal){alert(curVal)}}) ?
[12:40:50] <sqpat17> i havent. Let me look up namespaced events
[12:41:16] <Krambiorix> seutje, Z3R0  window.parent != window
[12:41:26] <eddiemonge> ?on @ sqpat17
[12:41:27] <bot-t> sqpat17, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:41:47] <seutje> Krambiorix: well, window.opener should lead to the window that triggered the other to open
[12:41:51] <seutje> not sure if that works with _blank
[12:42:09] <sqpat17> i think i read something about .on but it had also suggested .bind/.unbind were internally using .on/.off now, is that incorrect?
[12:42:30] <sqpat17> im using 1.9.1
[12:42:52] <eddiemonge> sqpat17: yes they are so might as well yes on/off
[12:43:09] <fikst> JelmerD, by calling the callback inside the onChange event: callback(val)
[12:43:43] <sqpat17> actually since i have a handle to the function i want to unbind let me try passing the function reference to unbind as well
[12:43:43] <JelmerD> fikst: okay, I guess I know what you mean. Let me try something
[12:44:02] <Krambiorix> seutje, my solution doesn't work :s
[12:45:00] <seutje> it does for me, but it's hard to demo with JSfiddle's iframes ;:
[12:45:02] <seutje> :/
[12:45:15] <JelmerD> fikst: no, I don't :p
[12:45:20] <JelmerD> I will post it to pastebin
[12:45:42] <fikst> JelmerD, maybe JSDiddle can help
[12:46:29] <JelmerD> Would be better, true. But this will do I guess :) http://pastebin.com/6L3fGZxS
[12:46:42] <JelmerD> I call it as: callback: function(a,b){}
[12:46:57] <Krambiorix> seutje, window.opener != null -> works
[12:47:06] <Krambiorix> seutje, thanks!
[12:47:07] <JelmerD> That's all. so, I am not entirely sure what to do next. But I guess it's fairly simple, I just can't find it via Google :)
[12:47:12] <JelmerD> Guess I don't know the right search terms
[12:47:49] <JelmerD> Now I would like to return the curValue as the first parameter, but how :)
[12:53:09] <diamonds> is there a way to get the "type" from a namespaced event?
[12:53:34] <JelmerD> fikst: -----^
[12:54:12] <diamonds> oh nm I'm just screwing up the event
[12:56:02] <fikst> JelmerD, I don't understand what you want to do, is it: http://jsfiddle.net/XUUBP/1/ ?
[12:57:18] <eddiemonge> fikst: the each is unnecessary ...
[12:57:52] <fikst> in this case it is, but if a plugin can be applied to multiple elements its not
[12:58:25] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/XUUBP/2/
[13:00:09] <fikst> http://jsfiddle.net/XUUBP/5/ now each is justified :p
[13:00:48] <eddiemonge> is it?
[13:01:14] <JelmerD> fikst: yes, that work. I was using the .apply() as seen in some tutorials. But simply calling the function works great :)
[13:01:15] <JelmerD> Thanks
[13:01:33] <JelmerD> I have no idea why I should have used the .apply though, maybe I am messing something up right now, but whatever. It works :)
[13:01:53] <eddiemonge> JelmerD: do you know how apply works?
[13:02:15] <capeta> why a selector "input:text" also returns checkbox and radio?
[13:03:11] <eddiemonge> capeta: does it?
[13:03:16] <eddiemonge> doesnt seem like it does
[13:05:47] <fikst> eddiemonge, ok, its not, but i consider it good practice when writing a plugin, in case of a image gallery for ex...
[13:07:13] <eddiemonge> fikst: its actually bad practice if its not needed since it makes the code more complex and it runs far slower
[13:07:44] <eddiemonge> there are lots of cases for it though
[13:08:15] <eddiemonge> but this one was definitely not one of them since all that was being done was applying an event handler to a group so it was running two loops when only one was necessary
[13:08:37] <sqpat17> ok interesting, so i was having the issue with a bind to click firing multiple times after an unbind. When i call trigger, it only fires once as it should.
[13:08:50] <sqpat17> its bound to tap
[13:09:14] <fikst> yes, you are right, this was not of one of them
[13:09:21] <sqpat17> does anyone offhand know how to look up the events/functions bound to an element in jquery's internal model?
[13:09:44] <fikst> ill look at it case by case in the future :)

[13:20:21] <masentinel900> How can I replace a div by other?
[13:20:21] <eddiemonge> stop saying that
[13:20:30] <eddiemonge> ?replacewith @ masentinel900

[13:25:42] <dmcdaniel12> hey folks. Using jquery $('.top-link-cart').text() but it is showing (an empty string) in console.log. Any idea why?
[13:26:03] <eddiemonge> because you dont have an element with that class?
[13:26:09] <eddiemonge> because that element doesnt have text?
[13:26:11] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/JknJT/
[13:26:30] <masentinel900> This doesn't whatI need!
[13:27:08] <dmcdaniel12> eddiemonge: I checked and the class exists. I'm trying to grab it from between <a> tags
[13:28:01] <eddiemonge> dmcdaniel12: do console.log( $('.top-link-cart') )
[13:28:53] <dmcdaniel12> Object[a.top-link-cart /warp/checkout/cart/]
[13:29:25] <JelmerD> eddiemonge: no, I don't :)
[13:29:46] <dmcdaniel12> eddiemonge, it's strange. If I do it in the console, it works. If I do it in the function, it doesn't
[13:30:02] <eddiemonge> dmcdaniel12: then where is the function? is it in a doc ready block?
[13:30:31] <dmcdaniel12> yeah, i have all my js set-up until the doc is ready
[13:30:42] <dmcdaniel12> strange. Just randomly started working...
[13:31:17] <dmcdaniel12> I think it was because I was doing an ajax call that was still running while it was searching. I set it to run when completed and it now works. Thanks for the help
[13:34:48] <scar> Any idea how to add 3rd party custom effects to bxslider?
[13:54:01] <Niels___> I have breadcrumbs dynamically generated from URI segments, without url encoding <script> could be printed in the breadcrumb which is nasty, so I did the url decoding client side with jQuery to make them look pretty again, here's how i did it: http://pastebin.com/6Ji6ssBY is this completely retarded, how should I do this?
[13:59:29] <eddiemonge> Niels___: why isnt that done in the backend?
[14:00:58] <Niels___> eddiemonge: as stated, if i do the url decoding in the backend user added parameters could include <script> etc, i guess i'll have to strip tags, htmlspecialchars etc on everything then
[14:01:23] <Niels___> eddiemonge: but besides that, i COULD do it like this, right? without any security problems
[14:01:32] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/44uqF/
[14:01:43] <masentinel900> Someone could help me with that plz!!
[14:02:01] <eddiemonge> masentinel900: i think its time you learned javascript
[14:02:08] <masentinel900> Why?
[14:02:58] <eddiemonge> because you are asking lots of basic questions and it would greatly help your jquery knowledge.
[14:03:00] <eddiemonge> besides, there is nothing wrong with that code other than not being done
[14:03:34] <masentinel900> Ok, This Is because I didn't paste complete script
[14:03:37] <eddiemonge> Niels___: there are always security problems. why not just regex out any non- AZaz09 -_ char?
[14:04:14] <Niels___> eddiemonge: good idea
[14:04:50] <masentinel900> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5696578/
[14:05:59] <Niels___> masentinel900: dude, what is your question.. why are you pasting all that?
[14:07:00] <masentinel900> Niels___: The problem Is that I need to load a need page inside the dynamic div
[14:07:04] <masentinel900> Is another option..

[15:31:53] <eddiemonge> lots of people fro the looks of the user list
[15:40:36] <otters> is there a function like html() that also returns the source of the tag itself?
[15:43:15] <eddiemonge> otters: what do you mean returns the source? like outerhtml?
[15:44:09] <otters> yeah
[15:44:28] <otters> I guess that's it
[15:46:08] <MissionCoder> Greetings everyone, I have a slight problem. I am trying to create sort of a selection menu using "this". I am editing visibility value. The problem is that I need to somehow store the value of previously selected window edit it and then change the information about new window clicked
[15:57:45] <eddiemonge> MissionCoder: need more info
[15:58:01] <MissionCoder> Okay, I'll post the code
[16:00:07] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/hUbsC/
[16:01:12] <eddiemonge> MissionCoder: document.write? why?
[16:01:56] <MissionCoder> Because when I did it, I didn't intend to use jQuery so early :D
[16:02:44] <MissionCoder> But that's not the problem....
[16:03:43] <StephenS> MissionCoder: why don't you show us some code?
[16:04:04] <MissionCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/hUbsC/
[16:04:05] <MissionCoder> Here
[16:04:40] <eddiemonge> MissionCoder: you know the anchors should be IN the li's right?
[16:05:14] <MissionCoder> I did think about that, but now I know for sure :)
[16:08:47] <rainabba_> Struggling with a syntax/concept issue that I know I'm making too hard. I'm using ASP.Net web services so my json must be structured as my classes are. I have a class named jI with property ItemID. The result I think should be {jI: {ItemID: 0}} if the ItemID were 0 but I'm wondering how to best build that (as a string, as object declaration without quotes (the 0 is actually going to be retrieved
[16:08:47] <rainabba_> via $.val()
[16:09:10] <naeluh> I am having a bit of trouble getting my jquery not to flash the unchanged text can someone take a look http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site6/ its the text right when it loads
[16:09:14] <eddiemonge> MissionCoder: so whats wrong with your code then?
[16:09:37] <naeluh> I am using fitext and texilate
[16:10:02] <MissionCoder> The problem is that, I visibility to change back to the hidden when user clicks on something else
[16:10:03] <naeluh> fittext and textillate
[16:10:17] <MissionCoder> But I didn't found anything that I could use for that
[16:10:20] <naeluh> any way to get it load properly
[16:10:21] <rainabba_> naeluh: "not to flash"? I see a menu that seems to change font a bit and animated text flying in.
[16:11:01] <naeluh> rainabba_: it doesn't display a small verison of the text that flys in?
[16:12:00] <StephenS> MissionCoder: maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/hUbsC/1/
[16:12:06] <naeluh> rainabba_: for me it displays the unchanged version real quick and the runs the animation are you not getting that ?
[16:13:30] <rainabba_> naeluh: Had to reload a few times to see (and your page takes 52 second to queue) but it shows for a moment then disappears.
[16:13:31] <MissionCoder> Stephen, not really unfortunately. I need to hide the previously shown div
[16:13:34] <MissionCoder> When user decides to show another div
[16:13:53] <naeluh> rainabba_: anyway to fix that ?
[16:13:54] <rainabba_> naeluh: You REALLY have to address that loading speed.
[16:14:05] <StephenS> MissionCoder: ah lol, I thought you want method with this, hold up
[16:14:06] <naeluh> maybe minify the scripts
[16:14:14] <MissionCoder> :D
[16:14:18] <rainabba_> naeluh: What's the ID for the container that the smalled text is in? What are you doing with it?
[16:14:25] <MissionCoder> Thank you for your contribution
[16:15:08] <naeluh> rainabba_: its h2.toptext I am using the fitext to make it resposive to the viewport and using textillate to animate it thats it
[16:15:33] <rainabba_> All those <a>'s with inline styles and explicit URLs don't help, but there's no way it's the page size causing the problem. Is that page built on the fly or mostly static?
[16:15:55] <naeluh> rainabba_: static
[16:15:57] <rainabba_> h2.toptext is the small text or the large, fly-in text?
[16:16:12] <eddiemonge> MissionCoder: .closest('ul').find('.menu').hide()
[16:16:15] <naeluh> rainabba_: flyin text
[16:16:31] <rainabba_> naeluh: You have server issues then or something else hanging up the retrieval. It's the actual page retrieval that slow, not loading.
[16:16:50] <rainabba_> naeluh: What's the selector for the small text that you want to keep showing?
[16:17:45] <naeluh> rainabba_: maybe it combine and compress the js - the selector is .navlink a
[16:18:20] <naeluh> rainabba_: maybe minify would help but it seems to be the load order
[16:19:25] <rainabba_> naeluh: Ok, "A coming together of ideas" only exists in one place and it's in the SVG. So the text isn't flashing, it's showing then being animated (moved from in-frame to outof frame then flown back in).
[16:20:10] <naeluh> rainabba_: ok let me try it out
[16:23:16] <naeluh> rainabba_: I am not exactly sure what your saying should I move it out the div with the svg ?
[16:24:45] <rainabba_> You need to use JsFiddle or similar to show the relevant code (what you're using to animate and what you're animating) so I don't have to analyze your entire page. The I might be able to make a suggestion. No guarantees though.
[16:26:54] <naeluh> rainabba_: ok let me see what I can do
[16:27:27] <Third3ye> So I'm making a menu where the buttons have classes like "btn_interviews", "btn_forums", etc -- and there are submenus with similar IDs, except without the "btn_", that all have the class "submenu". I'm using $('[id^=btn_]').mouseover to hide all current blocks with the class "submenu" but I'm not sure how to extract the end of the selecor (i.e "interviews" from "btn_interviews")
[16:28:03] <Third3ye> to show that specific submenu
[16:28:09] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: why dont you just add a class to make it easier?
[16:29:22] <Third3ye> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[16:29:53] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: instead of searching by id, search by class
[16:31:42] <rainabba_> Third3ye: You're looking for attribute selctors and wildcards. '[id]=btn_interviews' works for an exact match. I think you need something like [id]^=interviews for the tail match but I agree with eddiemonge in this case. You should be using classes if you're not searching for a unique instance by a precise id. That IS what classes are for.
[16:32:50] <rainabba_> Third3ye: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ and http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[16:33:13] <rainabba_> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[16:33:25] <rainabba_> $= is the endsWith (tail) selector
[16:33:25] <Third3ye> Actually I want to make a function that doesn't need to be updated if another menu and submenu were to be added
[16:33:47] <rainabba_> Yeah, perfect use case for classes
[16:35:05] <rainabba_> just give each menu item an 'imAMenuItemPleaseAnimateMe' class and use that in your .mouseover call
[16:35:42] <Third3ye> Yeah, but I still want to know how to disect the end off of the class or ID (if "btn_interviews" is selected I want to use "interviews" in the function)
[16:36:01] <rainabba_> or select against a parent with .on() and use the selector parameter of on() to identify the apporiate dom elements based on the type, heirarchy, etc.
[16:38:47] <rainabba_> Retrieve the ID from the object.
[16:38:47] <rainabba_> You'll have to parse the string from the by replacing btn_ with ''
[16:38:48] <rainabba_> s/the/there
[16:38:48] <Third3ye> Well the HTML is pretty simple. A span with <a>s as the main_menu and a span per submenu with <a>s
[16:38:48] <Third3ye> I know that's HTML blasphemy, but what more can you do?
[16:38:49] <rainabba_> You're making it too hard.
[16:38:49] <rainabba_> And that's not blasphemy though a list is FAR more appropriate.
[16:38:50] <Third3ye> No, I'm making it easy for a friend of mine to read the HTML -- adding a whole bunch of <ul>s with nested blocks and stuff is not what I want
[16:38:50] <eddiemonge> Third3ye: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr
[16:38:50] <rainabba_> <ul><li><li><ul>
[16:38:53] <rainabba_> Third3ye: No, you're making it hard by trying to select by part of the ID instead of using classes and attributes.
[16:39:30] <KeyboardNotFound> NataLia: why you spam me when i join #jquery ?
[16:42:20] <gnarf> KeyboardNotFound: i didn't get any message from NataLia when I joined just now, has anyone else gotten one?
[16:42:32] <rainabba_> <span id="menu"><a class="foo menuItem" menu="item1">item1</a><a class="foo menuItem" menu="item2">item2</a><span>  <script>$('#menu').on('mouseover', 'a.menuItem', function(event) { var menuItem = $(event.currentTarget).attr('menu'); //do something });</script>

[19:00:12] <defaultro> hey folks, which link can I read up regarding event propagation?
[19:00:59] <eddiemonge> anew: because it already parsed the json
[19:01:07] <anew> yes, how do u know that eddiemonge
[19:01:33] <eddiemonge> because otherwise it would work. ajax ops try to auto-parse the returned response
[19:01:45] <eddiemonge> ?stoppropagation @ defaultro
[19:01:45] <bot-t> defaultro, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[19:02:00] <eddiemonge> anew: you should specify datatype anyway though
[19:02:07] <defaultro> k
[19:02:59] <anew> becuase otherwise it would work ...

[19:09:31] <bambanx> exist any project of a cms using only jquery? no database is possible?

[19:17:22] <anew> yes one does
[19:17:32] <anew> but... if ur asking that question i think it might be a little over your head
[19:17:39] <anew> better start with the basics
[19:17:55] <anew> and no databse, i dont even knwo what that means
[19:20:56] <bambanx> lol
[19:20:58] <bambanx> sorry guys
[19:21:03] <bambanx> i am ignorant
[19:22:20] <bambanx> i am trying to find a way for manage some data without a lot of stuff ,the most simple posible , is like a gallery with a admin page where u can upload photos , and i was thinking about if is posible do this with jquery
[19:24:14] <eddiemonge> bambanx: you could use jquery to upload images to a server but you still need a back end to process it all
[19:24:45] <bambanx> thanks eddiemonge so always is necesarry use a server language like php?
[19:25:00] <eddiemonge> if you want to do stuff then yes
[19:25:10] <eddiemonge> if you dont care about saving then no
[20:01:49] <ddsss> let's say I have a div with sme text - can I show that div inside of a modal without removing it from the dom?
[20:09:57] <eddiemonge> ddsss: you mean like .clone() it? or move it with .append()?
[20:10:25] <ddsss> eddiemonge, well. I guess I though about kinda like showing it twice, as in: by reference.
[20:10:52] <ddsss> eddiemonge, but that's probably a no.
[20:15:24] <Dexx1_> Can someone take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/CsrrR/ -- (I may have copied and pasted it wrong, but I cant spot the mistake -- anyway, the real issue lies between 10-20 in the Javascript panel...I want to display the "links used" dynamically on the bottom of the docoument)

[20:37:38] <defaultro> good evening folks. Can someone please provide a simple example code of event delegation?
[20:40:47] <cincyguy5646> $("table").delegate("elementnameyouwanttostayattachedtofire", "click", function() { $(this).toggleClass("chosen"); }); is the same thing as $("table").on("click", "elementnameyouwanttostayattachedtofire", function() { $(this).toggleClass("chosen"); });

[20:46:57] <ddsss> some good dynamic dropdown population plugin on when suser begins typing  word...?
[20:47:19] <ddsss> s/suser/user/
[20:47:23] <eddiemonge> ?on @ defaultro
[20:47:24] <bot-t> defaultro, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:47:26] <cincyguy5646> livevalidation.com
[20:47:38] <eddiemonge> ddsss: jqueryui autocomplete
[20:48:26] <cincyguy5646> .on() kicks ass
[20:49:01] <ddsss> eddiemonge, ahh yes. thanks!
[20:49:53] <defaultro> thanks eddiemonge
[20:50:43] <defaultro> I did some reading and learned that using event delegation, we can save memory by not specifying events to an element like all cells in table
[20:50:49] <defaultro> am I right?
[20:51:16] <eddiemonge> defaultro: not quite
[20:51:23] <cincyguy5646> no defaultro
[20:51:45] <defaultro> oh
[20:51:48] <eddiemonge> event delegation is mostly so you can have events "attach" to elements that dont yet exist
[20:52:03] <cincyguy5646> http://try.jquery.com has great examples of why that's not true defaultro
[20:52:17] <defaultro> why not true?
[20:52:34] <defaultro> that's an awesome linke
[20:52:36] <defaultro> link
[20:53:25] <defaultro> what is this thing called then? I want to attach an event to table so that all things under it like cells can also have an event without writing all the events on each cell?
[20:53:51] <defaultro> is that event bubbling?
[20:54:03] <cincyguy5646> are you trying to do some sort of validation?
[20:54:05] <myton> hello, trying to create behavior from http://jsfiddle.net/alnitak/WsHvS/ in single html file
[20:54:17] <myton> My code here: http://pastebin.com/WAbfAy0m, is not working
[20:54:18] <defaultro> cincyguy5646, no, I'm just trying to learn the concept
[20:55:27] <eddiemonge> defaultro: yes that is event bubbling
[20:55:33] <defaultro> ah, got it
[20:55:44] <defaultro> i'll google some code so I can understand it better
[20:55:48] <eddiemonge> when you attach an event to an element, the children activate that event
[20:55:49] <defaultro> or maybe our bot knows one
[20:55:58] <defaultro> k
[20:56:10] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ myton
[20:56:10] <b-ot> myton: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[20:56:11] <bot-t> myton, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[20:56:21] <defaultro> i want to see an example code
[20:56:28] <defaultro> ?bubbling
[20:56:30] <bot-t> defaultro, event.stopPropagation() | jQuery API Documentation - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[20:56:57] <defaultro> no bot, I want to see an example of bubbling
[20:57:18] <defaultro> like click event on other html elements
[20:57:35] <eddiemonge> defaultro: there isnt an example. it just happens
[20:57:57] <myton> eddiemonge and bot-t, I'll look into .ready. Thank you.
[20:58:09] <mAx--> one question guys.. is it important to have all my js code inside $(document).ready(function () { });  in my js file?
[20:58:15] <defaultro> ok, but I want to see an example like i assign an click event to one element like a table then I want the cells to have it too
[20:58:37] <eddiemonge> mAx--: no. you just need the parts that actually do things to the dom when its ready inside of it
[20:58:37] <defaultro> then maybe display which row/col it is
[20:58:47] <defaultro> then maybe display which row/col of the cell I clicked
[20:58:52] <eddiemonge> defaultro: any example will work
[20:58:57] <defaultro> or change the color of it
[20:59:07] <defaultro> ok
[20:59:13] <eddiemonge> defaultro: its not going to say which row/col you clicked. the best you can do is to look at e.target
[20:59:22] <defaultro> k
[21:00:25] <defaultro> please look at this thread, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546083/examples-of-common-practical-uses-of-event-bubbling-and-capturing
[21:00:35] <defaultro> look at the accepted answer
[21:01:03] <defaultro> what does dynamicElement(2nd param) in  $("#someContainer").on("click", ".dynamicElement", function() do?
[21:01:41] <defaultro> i know it's a class
[21:01:43] <mAx--> for some reason i see my js file loaded in the page but is not working
[21:01:53] <cincyguy5646> its the child element inside of #someContainer that is attached to the event handler
[21:02:10] <mAx--> hate being a newby
[21:02:43] <defaultro> got it
[21:03:02] <defaultro> i really need to find a complete code so I'll understand it better
[21:03:06] <cincyguy5646> anyone who says they are an expert is an idiot because two years from now they will be newbies again too
[21:03:08] <eddiemonge> ?on @ defaultro
[21:03:08] <bot-t> defaultro, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:03:14] <eddiemonge> defaultro: read that whole page
[21:03:21] <defaultro> cool
[21:03:44] <coldhead> cincyguy5646: i am an idiot and i don't even say i'm an expert
[21:03:45] <eddiemonge> mAx--: cant really help without more info
[21:03:49] <cincyguy5646> default i had those same questions and try.jquery.com made them all click
[21:03:54] <cincyguy5646> lol @ cold
[21:04:25] <defaultro> i have the link open but I haven't look at the examples yet
[21:04:33] <mAx--> eddiemonge:  im doing console.log($('#outputHolder').dialog); and i get ReferenceError: linkData is not defined
[21:04:50] <eddiemonge> mAx--: still not helpful without an example, link or something
[21:04:58] <cincyguy5646> just do the exercises, they are the least annoying way of learning how jquery dances with the dom
[21:06:05] <mAx--> eddiemonge:  http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/10/
[21:08:31] <eddiemonge> mAx--: what are you trying to do? why is there a load and a post?
[21:11:06] <defaultro> What is SVG in Note: Delegated events do not work for SVG.
[21:12:29] <sheilablackrose> hi guys im getting an error with i.e 8 for this code. Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).splice(2);
[21:12:47] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy svg @ defaultro
[21:12:48] <bot-t> defaultro, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=svg
[21:13:03] <defaultro> :D
[21:15:12] <defaultro> wow, I didn't know that svg was an element or tag
[21:24:51] <defaultro> I want to master referencing to an element. How do I refer to the second <a> in <div><a>1</a><a>2</2></div> Is it  $('div a a').....?
[21:28:36] <coldhead> $('div a:nth(1)')
[21:28:40] <coldhead> ?nth
[21:28:41] <bot-t> coldhead, :nth-child() Selector | jQuery API Documentation - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[21:29:06] <coldhead> apparently i mean
[21:29:07] <coldhead> ?eq
[21:29:08] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[21:29:16] <coldhead> $('div a:eq(1)')
[21:29:45] <defaultro> thanks
[21:30:18] <defaultro> so it's not nth(2) since I want the second a?
[21:30:25] <coldhead> nth doesn't work
[21:30:31] <cincyguy5646> zero based index
[21:30:34] <coldhead> it's not a pseudoselector
[21:30:43] <coldhead> eq is and is 0 based
[21:30:50] <coldhead> trust me, it's my first day using jquery
[21:30:53] <coldhead> i know this stuff
[21:31:02] <cincyguy5646> of course..
[21:31:13] <defaultro> :)
[21:31:34] <defaultro> so eq is better for this?
[21:31:59] <defaultro> what if there is another outer div with no id and class?
[21:32:06] <defaultro> div div a:eq(2)
[21:32:21] <cincyguy5646> traversal is always better on the dom than pseudo selectors
[21:32:21] <defaultro> is that correct?
[21:32:33] <defaultro> what does that mean?
[21:32:58] <coldhead> it means you should read more
[21:33:28] <cincyguy5646> pseudo is when you use a selector like $("td:first")
[21:34:12] <cincyguy5646> traversal would be $("td").first();
[21:34:17] <defaultro> yup, i got that part. What about traversal?
[21:34:19] <defaultro> ah
[21:34:25] <defaultro> like .find()?
[21:34:32] <cincyguy5646> yup
[21:34:57] <defaultro> let me google jquery traversal selectors :)
[21:34:57] <cincyguy5646> less of a memory hog
[21:35:15] <cincyguy5646> or....... http://try.jquery.com like i told you 89 questions ago
[21:35:18] <Andrew_R> defaultro: your selector means find the 3rd <a> for every div that is within another div, and they don't have to be direct parent/child relations
[21:35:30] <eddiemonge> defaultro: why dont you just read the api.jquery.com?
[21:35:38] <eddiemonge> or http://learn.jquery.com/
[21:35:43] <defaultro> k
[21:36:21] <coldhead> this is also a good resource http://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?DRIS_ID=MS58_003v
[21:36:35] <defaultro> k
[21:38:26] <cincyguy5646> ok my turn.. when using .wrap() how do you designate where the text in the encapsulating element is located in relation to the element being encapsulated?
[21:39:05] <defaultro> lol, what is that link coldhead, hehehe
[21:39:45] <cincyguy5646> coldhead you've been learning jquery for at least 2 hours, im sure you know.. :)
[21:39:45] <eddiemonge> cincyguy5646: say what?
[21:40:38] <Andrew_R> cincyguy5646: it always goes right in the middle
[21:40:51] <cincyguy5646> thanks andrew, i dont think i could have explained that any better lol
[21:41:22] <cincyguy5646> andrew, should i just append text after wrapping to avoid that headache
[21:41:26] <Andrew_R> .wrap("<div><strong></strong></div>") == <div><strong>#yourElement</strong></div>
[21:43:18] <cincyguy5646> i had a <span>Invalid characters detected</span>  wrapping an <input type="text" id="fieldyoudontwanttoenterinvalidcharactersinto">, basically my own simple little validation effect and the validation text was being placed in front of the text, so annoying..
[21:43:41] <cincyguy5646> i mean being placed in front of the input field
[21:43:42] <Andrew_R> how about var myNewEl = $('<div><strong></strong><span>Something else</span></div>'); myNewEl.find('strong').html($('#yourSelector')); $('#yourSelector').replaceWith(myNewEl);
[21:44:38] <Andrew_R> or $('#yourSelector').replceWith('<div><strong>' + $('#yourSelector').html() + '</strong><span>something else</span></div>');
[21:45:13] <eddiemonge> why do you need to wrap the input?
[21:45:14] <Andrew_R> about wrap: yeah I don't know what happens if there is no "middle"
[21:46:19] <cincyguy5646> its like a validation box that blankets the field and has some tips/validation text the user sees
[21:47:40] <cincyguy5646> i have a form with multiple columns, i'm not interested in the jquery ui tooltip that hovers above the field, i think the wrap is cleaner and easier to manage from a form real estate standpoint.
[21:48:29] <cincyguy5646> andrew, if there is no middle, the element being wrapped is placed after the parent text
[21:48:54] <cincyguy5646> so if you want to place it after the element being wrapped, the text needs to be appended afterwards i suppose
[21:49:03] <cincyguy5646> which sucks teets
[21:49:11] <coldhead> hey who doesn't
[21:49:19] <cincyguy5646> im not sure,
[21:49:24] <cincyguy5646> people without lips
[21:49:28] <cincyguy5646> ?
[21:49:33] <coldhead> those guys freak me out
[21:49:51] <cincyguy5646> they ask for change when you are filling up your gas tank
[22:01:14] <defaultro> going back to <div><div><a>1</a><a>2</a></div></div>, am I right that I should refer to second <a> as $('div div a:eq(1)')
[22:01:33] <coldhead> ?tias
[22:01:34] <b-ot> coldhead: Try It And See
[22:01:34] <bot-t> Try It And See
[22:01:42] <cincyguy5646> do you use jsfiddle defaultro?
[22:01:51] <cincyguy5646> if you dont you are kicking yourself in the teeth right now
[22:01:58] <defaultro> not much. I will try it now
[22:02:09] <defaultro> i am confused on the left pane
[22:02:24] <cincyguy5646> select jquery 1.9.0
[22:02:27] <defaultro> k
[22:03:04] <cincyguy5646> that loads the library like <script src="jquery-1.9.0.js"></script> or whereever the hell your library gets loaded from
[22:03:15] <defaultro> cool
[22:04:28] <defaultro> yay, it worked! http://jsfiddle.net/PPNAt/
[22:04:51] <defaultro> so using space is for referring to the child and lower
[22:05:13] <defaultro> is that statement always true?
[22:05:43] <Andrew_R> defaultro: it works just like CSS
[22:05:55] <defaultro> i'm also not that good yet in css
[22:06:40] <cincyguy5646> i think you are trying to learn algebra before you have learned basic match, that might be a problem
[22:06:53] <defaultro> that could be true
[22:06:58] <cincyguy5646> my recommendation is to go to http://w3schools.com and stay on that for at least a month
[22:07:03] <defaultro> problem with me is that i am jumping
[22:07:34] <Andrew_R> might want to check out http://w3fools.com/ before going to w3schools
[22:07:51] <coldhead> defaultro: you have been on #jQuery for the last 16 years
[22:08:12] <defaultro> lol
[22:08:18] <defaultro> 16 weeks
[22:09:52] <eddiemonge> my recommendation is to never go to 3wschools.com and never stay on it
[22:10:34] <cincyguy5646> w3schools is a beginner playground, he wants to jump from one thing to another, what is better for that than w3s?
[22:10:56] <eddiemonge> ummmm everything?
[22:10:58] <cincyguy5646> maybe tizag too but i dunno you have been on both and so has everyone else who chips in their 2 cents, we all have
[22:11:05] <Andrew_R> http://www.webplatform.org/
[22:11:07] <defaultro> i'm reading the links that was suggested earlier
[22:11:22] <defaultro> i've started from beginning an hour ago
[22:11:26] <coldhead> enjoy the book of kells
[22:11:47] <eddiemonge> hmm midori snowcone is interesting
[22:12:29] <cincyguy5646> a free lynda.com account is also nice to have..
[22:13:14] <eddiemonge> id prefer a codecademy.com account
[22:14:16] <cincyguy5646> our development team is JUST NOW moving from classic asp to .NET
[22:14:31] <defaultro> This was suggested to me: defaultro, Explore the intricacies of HTML and CSS here: http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page, http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/tutorials, http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/tutorials, http://css.maxdesign.com.au, http://diveintohtml5.info, http://html5doctor.com
[22:14:48] <eddiemonge> cincyguy5646: im sorry
[22:15:05] <eddiemonge> defaultro: those are good
[22:15:10] <defaultro> thanks
[22:16:00] <cincyguy5646> our chief programmer hated jQuery when i started there, he called it gayQuery
[22:16:09] <coldhead> HILARIOUS
[22:16:14] <coldhead> because GAY MEANS BAD
[22:16:18] <coldhead> HAHAHAHA
[22:16:19] <coldhead> >: |
[22:16:25] <cincyguy5646> no it means you are not republican
[22:16:38] <Andrew_R> cincyguy5646: ASP.NET MVC4 right?
[22:16:45] <coldhead> you should have recommend gayQueery, for the definitive homosexual experience
[22:16:49] <eddiemonge> cincyguy5646: he is also using .net so there
[22:16:55] <Andrew_R> coldhead: haha :)
[22:17:48] <cincyguy5646> no, web forms andrew
[22:17:55] <Andrew_R> cincyguy5646: ouch bummer
[22:18:12] <Andrew_R> is it too late to rethink that? ;)
[22:18:18] <cincyguy5646> and since our new programmer from foxsports is c# savvy we are now going from VB to C#
[22:19:02] <Andrew_R> C# is good
[22:19:22] <Andrew_R> but I don't want to work on any more webforms sites if I don't have to
[22:19:57] <cincyguy5646> so it was of course hilarious when our new programmer told my chief programmer how foxsports used the jquerymobile framework for their NCAA bracket app,
[22:20:16] <cincyguy5646> gayQuery became ok teach me how to use this shit
[22:20:44] <cincyguy5646> i told my chief programmer, just call defaultro, he can teach you
[22:20:56] <coldhead> respect
[22:21:27] <cincyguy5646> american airlines uses jquerymobile now, pretty sweet
[22:21:33] <defaultro> what's going on guys?
[22:21:38] <rakl> so, radio buttons don't have an attribute that relates to their checked status?
[22:21:43] <cincyguy5646> not much, hows your jumping coming along
[22:21:46] <cincyguy5646> yes
[22:21:53] <cincyguy5646> prop("checked")
[22:21:58] <defaultro> :)
[22:22:00] <rakl> I know I can set it with .prop('checked', true). But that doesn't update the dom element?
[22:22:37] <cincyguy5646> i've had some problems with .prop and checkboxes, something i think the new version will be addressed
[22:22:48] <cincyguy5646> addressing
[22:23:05] <cincyguy5646> i mean radios, sorry
[22:23:31] <cincyguy5646> my recommendation is to use regular JS for the radio buttons
[22:23:50] <Andrew_R> I think you can use .click() on radio buttons to select them
[22:23:53] <cincyguy5646> its going to be cross browser compatible and you dont have to worry about the bs you may run into
[22:24:06] <cincyguy5646> andrew you never had that prob with .prop()?
[22:24:09] <cincyguy5646> on radios
[22:24:34] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/bnFa9/ radio checked
[22:24:36] <Andrew_R> I can't remember using it before
[22:25:25] <cincyguy5646> my problem was using the method for checking if it's true
[22:25:30] <cincyguy5646> not assigning it
[22:26:07] <eddiemonge> .checked
[22:26:11] <eddiemonge> is(':checked')
[22:26:20] <defaultro> just recalled a term that a friend of mine told me this morning, Prototype. Is it a library?
[22:26:48] <Andrew_R> both .prop('checked', true) and .click() work to select one: http://jsfiddle.net/bnFa9/1/
[22:27:54] <cincyguy5646> i was using it for a check all function, i dont remember trying "is:" so that could have been my answer eddie
[22:28:54] <cincyguy5646> i suck at jQuery but i REALLY sucked back then ::)
[22:30:01] <Andrew_R> I had a weird problem earlier: $select.change(function(){ alert($select.val()); /* the "old" value */ alert($(this).val()); /* the correct value */ });
[22:30:05] <cincyguy5646> andrew wouldn't  ,NET MVC4 be a harder transition for a classic asp developer vs. web forms/ web pages
[22:30:07] <Andrew_R> I wasn't able to reproduce it in a fiddle
[22:30:42] <cincyguy5646> you forgot the () for select
[22:30:50] <cincyguy5646> lol
[22:31:06] <Andrew_R> no, $select was a jquery object
[22:31:43] <cincyguy5646> i never tried it that way, i would use $("select")
[22:32:17] <innociv> He probably means it's a cached selector
[22:32:29] <cincyguy5646> wait, maybe i have seen something like that in json snippets..
[22:32:35] <cincyguy5646> i can't remember, im high
[22:32:39] <Andrew_R> yes, somewhere earlier I had var $select = $('#something.class select');
[22:33:09] <cincyguy5646> why use $ in front of the variable name?
[22:33:13] <innociv> You should use $(this) inside the function when your selector can be multiple elements
[22:33:14] <cincyguy5646> why not just var select
[22:33:22] <innociv> so you know the variable is a jquery object
[22:33:28] <Andrew_R> convention, then I know if it's a jquery object or not
[22:33:45] <Andrew_R> you don't have to, but I do it (and I made it part of our companies coding standards for jquery)
[22:34:03] <cincyguy5646> i wish my company had coding standards
[22:34:05] <innociv> I invented that. You have to pay me royalties
[22:34:14] <cincyguy5646> we just dont put userid in querystrings and.. thats it!
[22:34:38] <Andrew_R> innociv: I must owe you years worth of royalties then :p
[22:35:00] <cincyguy5646> inno: you can have my girlfriend she is worth at least 4 lines of your code
[22:35:16] <cincyguy5646> maybe 4.123
[22:36:13] <innociv> Heh
[22:36:37] <hazardous> hi , i have a lot of tr.row1 immedaitely followed by a display:none tr.row_more_data
[22:36:50] <hazardous> which function do i use to get something to slideDown after the tr.row1 is clicked
[22:36:57] <Andrew_R> cincyguy5646: either MVC or WebForms is going to have a learning curve for someone who only has done classic asp
[22:37:07] <hazardous> .closest()?
[22:37:15] <hazardous> or .next() or something
[22:38:14] <Andrew_R> hazardous: .next('.row_more_data') will select your data row
[22:38:29] <Andrew_R> or if it really is right after it, you can just use .next()
[22:39:24] <Andrew_R> $('td.row1').click(function() { $(this).next().slideToggle(); });
[22:42:22] <hazardous> Andrew_R: i have a *lot* of them, that binds all .row's?
[22:42:25] <hazardous> .row1's
[22:42:54] <Andrew_R> then you are better off using a delegate
[22:43:12] <Andrew_R> $('table').on('click', 'td.row1', function);
[22:43:34] <Andrew_R> that will bind 1 event, but only take action if the target is td.row1
[22:45:07] <hazardous> so something like $('#tbm').on('click', 'tr.row1', function() { $(this).next().slideToggle(); }); for <tr class=row1>x</tr><tr class=something style='display:none'></tr>
[22:46:23] <Andrew_R> yes that looks good
[22:46:26] <hazardous> works, thanks!
[22:46:31] <hazardous> bizarrely enough clicking it once shows it instantly
[22:46:36] <Andrew_R> cincyguy5646: http://www.intstrings.com/ramivemula/asp-net/why-asp-net-mvc-and-why-not-webforms/
[22:46:37] <hazardous> but clicking it again it takes 5-10 seconds to disappear
[22:47:57] <cincyguy5646> nice andrew, thanks
[22:48:02] <cincyguy5646> i'll give it a read
[22:48:51] <Andrew_R> hazardous: that's strange that it works fast to show, but not hide
[22:48:53] <Andrew_R> it should be the same
[22:49:06] <hazardous> is it maybe a side effect of having 1.9 million <tr>s
[22:49:55] <Andrew_R> I'm surprised it even loads with 1.9 million rows
[22:50:01] <cincyguy5646> bubbling or loop issue i suppose
[22:50:32] <Andrew_R> instead of slideToggle(), does toggle() work better?
[22:50:34] <hazardous> yep
[22:50:35] <hazardous> isntant on both
[22:50:48] <cincyguy5646> i like slideDown() and slideUp() as the callback
[22:50:54] <hazardous> i dunno why this page uses so much ram/cpu
[22:51:45] <hazardous> ..ok that was probably a dumb statement
[22:52:08] <Andrew_R> hazardous: are you testing this in IE?
[22:52:08] <cincyguy5646> lol
[22:52:09] <eddiemonge> 1.9mill rows?
[22:52:20] <hazardous> yea eddiemonge im just foreach()ing .append() from a json file
[22:52:25] <hazardous> well, for
[22:52:44] <eddiemonge> why do you have 1.9million rows?
[22:53:28] <Andrew_R> how can you find what you are looking for?
[22:53:38] <hazardous> ctrl+f
[22:53:42] <cincyguy5646> lol
[22:54:32] <Andrew_R> maybe have a search box and only add the rows that match
[22:54:36] <cincyguy5646> im pretty sure he meant the constructor of the event trigger lol
[22:55:14] <cincyguy5646> hazardous i wrote some code last week doing something like that
[22:55:27] <cincyguy5646> you have a fiddle for me to look at
[22:55:28] <Andrew_R> no I meant from a user experience, ok here's a page with 1.9 million rows, good luck, lol :)
[22:55:33] <cincyguy5646> lol
[22:58:31] <bigLanky> can anyone point me in a direction to get a hover effect that goes from http://screencast.com/t/J7j9AFH7T to http://screencast.com/t/Wo4FL27JQ - the idea is that you hover over products, the products and home menu buttons slide to the left revealing Fans and Racers
[22:59:44] <Cork> bigkevmcd: that would mostly be css for the look
[23:00:00] <Cork> and just an animation for showing and hiding the sub menu
[23:02:09] <cincyguy5646> ?bigLanky , i'd say $("navmenuname").find("products").prev("li").append("nameofobjectcontainingfansandracers")
[23:02:11] <bot-t> cincyguy5646, Couldn't find "bigLanky , i'd say $("navmenuname").find("products").prev("li").append("nameofobjectcontainingfansandracers")" in jQuery Docs.
[23:04:50] <Andrew_R> Doesn't need to be that hard
[23:04:51] <Andrew_R> $('#menu a').hover(function(){ $(this).addClass('hovered'); $(this).next().show(); }, function() { $(this).removeClass('hovered'); $(this).next().hide(); });
[23:05:17] <cincyguy5646> i can make it easier, fiddling it now lol
[23:05:23] <bigLanky> nice
[23:05:28] <cincyguy5646> that was my lazy answer lol
[23:05:32] <bigLanky> thanks for the help
[23:05:43] <Andrew_R> your HTML structure like <div id="menu"><li><a></li><li style="display:none;"><a><a></li></div>
[23:06:31] <cincyguy5646> toggleClass may be better
[23:06:36] <cincyguy5646> but that was nice too
[23:07:39] <Andrew_R> toggleClass is good, but I always worry about something else messing with that class and it getting out of sync
[23:07:56] <Andrew_R> a click or something is good to use toggleClass, but if you know you want it or not, I always use addClass and removeClass
[23:09:40] <cincyguy5646> you can do anything in 2000 different ways
[23:10:12] <coldhead> and you can make sweeping generalisations in 3000 ways
[23:10:56] <BFranks> Is there a 'clone' function? http://jsfiddle.net/rea8x/6/ I want the notes to be a pallet to tear off vs. just drag?
[23:11:50] <eddiemonge> ?clone @ BFranks
[23:11:50] <bot-t> BFranks, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[23:12:00] <eddiemonge> honestly its like people dont even look
[23:12:17] <cincyguy5646> lol
[23:12:18] <cincyguy5646> i know
[23:12:30] <cincyguy5646> is there a jquery chatroom on freenode.net?
[23:12:40] <Andrew_R> no
[23:12:45] <cincyguy5646> ok thanks, bye
[23:12:47] <Andrew_R> irc.freenode.net has one I think
[23:12:50] <coldhead> guys how do i connect to irc
[23:12:55] <cincyguy5646> no clue
[23:12:57] <coldhead> please tell me i have urgent deadline
[23:13:05] <cincyguy5646> sorry looks like you are screwed
[23:13:28] <hazardous> Andrew_R: btw, again - thanks a lot
[23:13:36] <Andrew_R> np :)
[23:13:44] <hazardous> i'm reasonably new to js and im still having my toruble finding my way around $(this) and this
[23:13:59] <hazardous> do you know of any resources for that
[23:14:12] <coldhead> hazardous: don't be afraid of $(), you can do $( $( $( this ) ) ) and it will still work
[23:14:20] <cincyguy5646> this is JavaScript's object reference .. $(this) is jQuery's object reference
[23:15:07] <hazardous> can you chain selectors?
[23:15:30] <cincyguy5646> like....?
[23:15:38] <coldhead> i can, yes
[23:15:46] <cincyguy5646> yeah i heard coldhead could
[23:15:54] <cincyguy5646> dont think anyone else can though
[23:15:56] <coldhead> $('.aids').add('.monkeys')
[23:16:17] <hazardous> hm, are we allowed to paste things in here or is there a lime limit
[23:16:49] <eddiemonge> hazardous: read the channel subject
[23:17:15] <cincyguy5646> we type code in here we dont paste it
[23:17:16] <cincyguy5646> cmon now
[23:17:21] <coldhead> 2 limes per drink
[23:17:27] <hazardous> drink?
[23:17:45] <coldhead> hazardous: you might need to get yourself a drink at this point
[23:18:21] <cincyguy5646> $("myBody").append("weed");
[23:18:39] <coldhead> drugs are hilarious
[23:18:57] <hazardous> what should i be doing for something like this http://pastie.org/pastes/7444774/text?key=qpxxkjl7yzfxhznju7splq
[23:19:22] <cincyguy5646> omg WORD WRAP
[23:19:39] <cincyguy5646> messy code = unread code
[23:19:53] <coldhead> you didn't read the topic
[23:19:57] <coldhead> get yourself another drink
[23:19:59] <coldhead> ?beauty
[23:20:00] <bot-t> please beautify your horrible code at http://jsbeautifier.org <3
[23:20:14] <hazardous> there is no js in that though
[23:21:18] <cincyguy5646> point is, who scrolls horizontally?
[23:21:22] <Andrew_R> guess what time it is guys
[23:21:28] <hazardous> weed time?
[23:21:28] <cincyguy5646> peanut butter jelly time?
[23:21:29] <bigLanky> Andrew_R; This is what I have so far http://pastebin.com/Pt081GaN
[23:21:32] <coldhead> 4:20
[23:21:33] <Andrew_R> check in time
[23:21:36] <coldhead> i mean it actually is
[23:21:38] <coldhead> for me here
[23:21:38] <cincyguy5646> it's 2:20 here
[23:21:42] <coldhead> 4 ACTUAL 20
[23:21:43] <hazardous> 23:21
[23:21:53] <Andrew_R> 01:21
[23:22:08] <cincyguy5646> $("myBong").add("blueBerryYumYum");
[23:22:17] <bigLanky> :)
[23:22:26] <cincyguy5646> i camelback my skunky nug code
[23:22:37] * coldhead calls the police
[23:22:42] <bigLanky> cincyguy5646: can you take a look at http://pastebin.com/Pt081GaN
[23:22:44] <cincyguy5646> is the police
[23:22:48] <bigLanky> lol
[23:22:51] <Andrew_R> I'm checking in my code and going to bed, time
[23:22:56] <cincyguy5646> you are under arrest, hand over your weed and your girlfriend virginity
[23:23:03] <cincyguy5646> 's^
[23:23:05] <coldhead> goodnight Andrew_R, you were one of the good ones
[23:23:19] <cincyguy5646> but im a bad one
[23:23:23] <cincyguy5646> thanks cold love you too
[23:23:43] <Andrew_R> thanks coldhead, why do we put up with this?
[23:23:54] <rindolf> Hi all.
[23:23:55] <cincyguy5646> because its better than porn
[23:24:10] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/#previous-vers - the accordion here does not work properly.
[23:24:23] <coldhead> social conditioning i guess
[23:24:48] <Andrew_R> conditioning who?
[23:25:22] <cincyguy5646> rindolf do you want the accordion to be collapsible?
[23:26:20] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/WS8nX/
[23:26:46] <bigLanky> trying to get that so when i hover over products, it reveals the other 2 <li> elements that are currently set to display: none
[23:27:02] <rindolf> cincyguy5646: I want the section to collapse by default (what's inside the <div>...</div>).
[23:27:04] <coldhead> society
[23:27:13] <coldhead> shampoo, condition, repeat
[23:27:47] <rindolf> Wow, my ISP sucks royally.
[23:28:25] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/eDhBM/ updated there
[23:28:41] <cincyguy5646> rindolf $( ".selector" ).accordion({ collapsible: true, active: false });
[23:28:53] * coldhead np: my bloody valentine - don't ask why
[23:29:25] <cincyguy5646> the collapsible parameter must be passed first before you can set active to false
[23:29:43] <cincyguy5646> jquery ui is fun like that
[23:31:10] <coldhead> but we've taken this long so why so starry eyed
[23:31:44] <cincyguy5646> @(*_*)@
[23:33:05] <Andrew_R> bigLanky: http://jsfiddle.net/eDhBM/1/
[23:33:23] <Andrew_R> oh yeah that's not quite right... :)
[23:33:35] <bigLanky> ah perfect
[23:33:40] <bigLanky> thanks Andrew_R! this is perfect
[23:34:05] <Andrew_R> except if you try to move to the added elements, it hides them
[23:34:18] <rindolf> cincyguy5646: thanks, that seems to work.
[23:34:28] <cincyguy5646> no problem
[23:34:37] <Andrew_R> anyway, it's on the right track...
[23:35:17] <cincyguy5646> bigLanky add "slow" in the show() and it will look "neater"
[23:35:41] <bigLanky> thanks for the tip
[23:35:48] <bigLanky> im going to style this up now.. hopefully i can make it look good
[23:36:12] <cincyguy5646> good luck
[23:36:20] <cincyguy5646> im going to bed, night everyone

[23:37:44] <wer0ckz> Hi. guys. Help please. click(function() is not working when i call outside another .js script. html file: http://pastebin.com/Zfh5m2pK - and my js file is http://pastebin.com/KyUJtfxq
[23:38:49] <rindolf> wer0ckz: can you use jsfiddle for that?
[23:38:56] <wer0ckz> ok
[23:39:47] <wer0ckz> its working using jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/NM62A/
[23:40:29] <wer0ckz> but my its not working if i create another .js file
[23:41:21] <wer0ckz> the click.js exist
[23:42:41] <wer0ckz> any ideas?
[23:44:33] <Andrew_R> bigLanky: this is a better update: http://jsfiddle.net/eDhBM/3/
[23:45:24] <wer0ckz> Hi. guys. Help please. click(function() is not working when i call outside another .js script. html file: http://pastebin.com/Zfh5m2pK - and my js file is http://pastebin.com/KyUJtfxq -  its working using jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/NM62A/ - but its not working if i create another .js file
[23:46:26] <coldhead> can you just put everything in the same file?
[23:47:43] <davesleep> when using $('form').on('submit)....
[23:47:50] <davesleep> how do i make it select a specific form by id?
[23:48:13] <davesleep> on('submit',function.. etc
[23:51:20] <gerrit_vh> davesleep: $('#formid').on('submit', function(){
[23:52:23] <davesleep> gotta be kiddin me, went round the houses after trying that
[23:52:39] <davesleep> cheers
[23:56:04] <BFranks> Hmmm.. I meant more about how I'd clone/leave a copy from the context of a tear-off pad? http://jsfiddle.net/rea8x/7/ .. I don't even think I'm dealing with the 'this' selector properly (shouldn't the function be passing the element handle as 'e' or something?) and even then I forsee issues with it working as hoped.. Hmm..
[23:56:49] <coldhead> it all sounds too hard, really
