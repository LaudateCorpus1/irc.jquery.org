[02:50:17] <Zeti> hi
[02:50:35] <Zeti> I have been using jquery mobile for a while now to my full satisfaction
[02:50:49] <Zeti> but now there is an issue at hand for which I have trouble finding a good solution
[02:50:50] <Zeti> printing
[02:50:57] <Zeti> if I look at the page in the print preview
[02:51:01] <Zeti> it looks well
[02:51:03] <Zeti> unsexy
[02:51:20] <Zeti> is there a jquerym print stylesheet or so available?
[04:36:44] <robdev> What would be the best approach to creating a container with thumbnails, having arrows on say the top and bottom and inside the container display three thumbnails - when either arrow was clicked to animate the contents of the container to display the next thumbnail in whatever directional arrow was clicked
[04:36:55] <robdev> would using .animate() be something?
[04:37:21] <robdev> I'm just wondering if so, how would I track once it got to the end in either direction
[04:37:24] <robdev> to disable the arrow
[04:37:30] <robdev> arrow(s)
[04:37:57] <robdev> I realize their are plugins, etc for this I would like ot try and create one
[04:38:19] <robdev> not a plugin but I think it should be a small script that could do this
[05:40:26] <megaTherion> How would I access pseudo-css style's via .style attribute?
[05:45:47] <megaTherion> I need to filter elements which are not :hover, I tried $(".active:not(:hover)", div).each already but thats not going to work. However things like $("#foo:hover") are working
[05:50:28] <eager> megaTherion: I have never tried such; but that sounds like quite a reverse logic, like you are trying to do a workaround anyways
[05:50:35] <eager> what is the usecase?
[05:51:17] <megaTherion> its not a workaround, I simply want to manipulate several elements but only for those where the mouse is not on top :) (meaning of course only one of them is not going manipulated)
[05:51:43] <eager> ppl might offer ideas where you don't have to look for non-hovered elements
[05:51:55] <eager> if you showed an example ^^
[05:52:22] <megaTherion> well I have sth like edit fields which are not editable (<span>), if I click into them I'll transform them into <input> or <textarea> whatever - so if I click somewhere else they shall become <span>'s again
[05:52:30] <megaTherion> somewhere else is simply on <body> or so
[05:53:25] <eager> actually, I remember reading that in such case it is still best to write some css that overrides the :hover state and "does back" everything the other manipulation did
[05:53:26] <megaTherion> maybe there are better ways to do this, but I simply want to respond on the user event basically
[05:54:11] <eager> well, wow :)
[05:54:32] <megaTherion> Im not sure how I'd acomplish this with css, I'd rather bind this to an user event - it shouldnt get automaticly "closed" if the mouse is moved out
[05:55:02] <eager> when I wrote css I hadn't yet read about the inputs, sorry...
[05:55:12] <megaTherion> no prob :)
[05:55:32] <megaTherion> how would I compare two elements, like $(".active:hover") == el?
[05:55:44] <eager> other thing, you took touchscreens into account when planning this?
[05:56:41] <megaTherion> maybe later on, I am thinking about mobile phones - but in fact this is not a specific framework...
[05:56:43] <eager> another thing inputs can have disabled attribute, wouldn't those help?
[05:56:58] <megaTherion> hmm what do you mean by disabled attribute?
[05:57:12] <eager> well, i must look it up :)
[05:57:16] * megaTherion is not really senior JS/jQuery developer
[05:57:28] <megaTherion> Im rather coming from application development, not necessarily web development - Im often doing backend stuff ^^
[05:57:49] <eager> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[05:58:10] <eager> "This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction."
[05:58:25] <eager> does this not apply to input[type="text"]
[05:58:26] <eager> ?
[06:00:04] <megaTherion> eager: other idea, would comparing like $(".active:hover") == element work?
[06:00:29] <eager> http://jsfiddle.net/f9sLoyuy/
[06:00:30] <megaTherion> meaning if that element isnt with mouse over, it cannot be the same
[06:00:56] <megaTherion> ah I see
[06:00:59] <megaTherion> but disabled is HTML5 or?
[06:01:28] <megaTherion> or at least they dont tell so, well Im thinkin about it :)
[06:02:03] <eager> my guess would be that it is older than that, so I'd expect them in xhtml1.0 too, should look that up, but, dunno where
[06:02:25] <megaTherion> I've a book about XHTML1, it would be in there then
[06:02:38] <megaTherion> but Im still not satisfied changing to static input elements and then applying disabled or not
[06:03:40] <eager> these ppl tell about compat: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_disabled.asp
[06:04:20] <eager> yep, it's available down to HTML 4.1
[06:14:40] <eager> disabled input elements can be styled to look like anything, you can remove all input-like appearance from them with the input[type="text"]:disabled { } selector
[06:14:41] <eager> http://jsfiddle.net/f9sLoyuy/1/
[06:21:22] <megaTherion> eager: I see
[06:26:19] <megaTherion> eager: I think I got it working my way
[06:26:47] <megaTherion> eager: if( typeof $(".active:hover", div)[x] === "undefined" ) <- if true, then mouse is not over
[06:27:02] <eager> wow :)
[06:27:33] <eager> erm
[06:28:05] <eager> well
[06:28:39] <eager> $(".active:hover", div) <-- why is the second argument, "div" ?
[06:29:02] <megaTherion> eager: I only want to search under that element (not on all of them)
[06:29:06] <eager> afaik it means that you are looking in .active:hover , but only in divs
[06:29:22] <eager> which is quite needless in this form i think
[06:29:29] <eager> ah
[06:29:46] <eager> ok, so it's not exactly div, only for the example then
[06:31:58] <megaTherion> eager: yeah its an variable, I set prior to this but in this special case it is an 'div'
[06:32:15] <megaTherion> the disabled idea is good too but it would mean so much overhead for me now...
[06:32:38] <megaTherion> I've put it in TODO list that this is not optimal - but I need to continue now ^^
[06:33:51] <eager> understood
[06:34:12] <eager> buffer overflow already, familiar :)
[06:42:00] <_biff> hi

[06:50:37] <TheWhisper> Hi
[06:55:56] <TheWhisper> http://jsfiddle.net/xrtp6x03/
[06:56:09] <TheWhisper> I'm trying to get the temperature values for each card
[06:56:12] <TheWhisper> and output them separately
[06:56:25] <TheWhisper> so then I can say, if temperature of the first card is X, then do Y
[06:56:32] <TheWhisper> and if temperature of the second card is B, then do C
[06:56:39] <TheWhisper> But it's outputting all the temperatures together
[06:56:46] <TheWhisper> Does anyone know how to get them separately?
[07:03:07] <TheWhisper> okay, seem tto have partially gotte nit
[07:03:09] <TheWhisper> *gotten it
[07:06:47] <TheWhisper> Yay, figured it out!
[07:47:42] <tiblock> Hi. I have API url that i call &callback=myfunc and it returns myfunc({...data...}); so to use it i need create temporary callback, append to page <script> then make timeour to cancel it on timeout, is there solution to this?
[07:48:04] <tiblock> like get_data_for_me('http://.../...', 'callback');
[07:48:15] <tiblock> well i hope you understood me
[07:48:57] <tiblock> no?
[07:49:56] <tiblock> here is URL https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/oembed.json?id=99530515043983360&callback=return_data_here how to get data from there with timeout with minimum pain?
[08:00:51] <tiblock> okay, found, its called jsonp https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:01:11] <tiblock> it needs "&callback=?" in url and it will do the task
[08:13:50] <wa5ted> grafi: ?
[08:24:07] <evident> hi everybody... can anybody tell me if it's possible to extract the Panel widget from jquerymobile? For a project I am using ChocolateChip-UI and would like to integrate a drawer menu that can either overlay or push the content away, like it does right here: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/panel/
[08:24:50] <evident> But I can't just add jquerymobile because it will mess up the chocolatechip ui layout etc... is there a simple way of getting such drawer menus?
[08:30:50] <wa5ted> evident: im pretty sure jquerymobile has custom builds by which you can customize so that you get the structure only
[08:31:00] <wa5ted> just the skeleton
[08:34:45] <Doddlin> Hello all!

[08:35:46] <Doddlin> anyone?
[08:38:27] <wa5ted> evident: also this is jquery mobile question, you should head to #jquerymobile-dev
[08:39:32] <wa5ted> Doddlin: possibly google it https://github.com/firstopinion/formatter.js/issues/29
[08:39:43] <wa5ted> what browser what jquery plugin
[08:40:01] <wa5ted> you are selection the sbumit
[08:40:04] <wa5ted> submit
[08:40:06] <wa5ted> why?
[08:40:24] <wa5ted> Doddlin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22486220/add-select2-data-and-date-format-to-database-with-php
[08:40:36] <Doddlin> wa5ted, just jquery, no plugs
[08:40:41] <Doddlin> trying to fire an AJx
[08:40:46] <Doddlin> AJAX*call
[08:41:12] <Doddlin> and chrome
[08:42:10] <Doddlin> wa5ted, I have $(’#submitform’).click( and then the function. Maybe there is a more suitable solution
[08:42:27] <wa5ted> show me your function
[08:42:30] <wa5ted> gist it
[08:42:33] <wa5ted> im curious
[08:42:37] <wa5ted> and comment so i understand
[08:42:45] <wa5ted> cause i dont ahve the full context
[08:42:48] <wa5ted> Doddlin: ^
[08:43:05] <Doddlin> wa5ted, paste coming up, hang on
[08:45:04] <wa5ted> yh
[08:46:02] <Doddlin> wa5ted, http://pastebin.com/gBz2iahw
[08:46:22] <wa5ted> Doddlin: enable js formatting next time
[08:46:33] <Doddlin> ah, sry
[08:46:46] <wa5ted> also
[08:46:48] <wa5ted> why not use $.post
[08:46:50] <wa5ted> directly
[08:47:25] <Doddlin> wa5ted, didn’t know it existed, pretty new to this
[08:47:26] <wa5ted> question
[08:47:34] <wa5ted> read up on it
[08:47:36] <wa5ted> btw
[08:47:38] <wa5ted> also
[08:47:40] <wa5ted> do this
[08:47:45] <wa5ted> try a .submit event
[08:47:47] <wa5ted> on the form itself
[08:47:58] <Doddlin> tried that, gave the same error :S
[08:48:41] <wa5ted> well its failing on read
[08:49:06] <Doddlin> wa5ted, no sorry, it gave Illegal invocation
[08:49:07] <wa5ted> what line does it say the error occurs on
[08:49:16] <wa5ted> what?
[08:49:43] <Doddlin> wa5ted, line 28 in the paste
[08:50:04] <wa5ted> what is the argument in the start of that
[08:50:06] <wa5ted> event
[08:50:14] <Doddlin> on line 28?
[08:50:20] <wa5ted> line 18
[08:50:22] <wa5ted> the argument
[08:50:43] <Doddlin> useThisEmail is the variable from the script before
[08:50:52] <Doddlin> starting to think I’m passing them wrong…?
[08:50:59] <wa5ted> i think
[08:51:03] <wa5ted> but the error is interesting
[08:51:11] <wa5ted> "The input element's type ('submit') does not support selection."
[08:51:16] <wa5ted> ^this is the key phrase
[08:51:25] <wa5ted> are you sure you are selecting the right inputs
[08:51:42] <Doddlin> <input type="submit" class="orange-btn" value="Send!" id="submitbutton">
[08:52:22] <wa5ted> just wanna see something
[08:52:27] <wa5ted> line 18
[08:52:31] <wa5ted> put event as argument
[08:52:47] <Doddlin> so .click(function(event){ ?
[08:52:52] <wa5ted> just curious
[08:52:57] <wa5ted> what is useThisEmail
[08:52:59] <wa5ted> anyways
[08:53:13] <Doddlin> the variable gotten from the first ajax-script
[08:53:50] <wa5ted> why not store that in a global var instead of passing it as an argument
[08:53:54] <wa5ted> and then pull that global var
[08:54:01] <Doddlin> true that
[08:54:21] <wa5ted> Doddlin: also your for-submit-script
[08:54:23] <wa5ted> im assuming is static
[08:54:25] <wa5ted> and doesnt change its place
[08:54:30] <Doddlin> now I got useThisEmail is not defined
[08:54:42] <wa5ted> there
[08:54:43] <Doddlin> on the console-log-line
[08:54:45] <wa5ted> yeah
[08:54:56] <wa5ted> define useThis email
[08:55:00] <wa5ted> useThisEmail
[08:55:07] <Doddlin> how?
[08:55:07] <wa5ted> outside of the scope of both events
[08:55:18] <wa5ted> var useThisEmail;
[08:55:23] <wa5ted> [events here]
[08:55:31] <wa5ted> im just organizign a bit
[08:55:37] <wa5ted> trying to pick and see whats going o
[08:55:39] <wa5ted> on
[08:56:08] <Doddlin> wa5ted
[08:56:08] <wa5ted> question
[08:56:13] <Doddlin> that made the script go through
[08:56:15] <wa5ted> enter[var here]
[08:56:23] <wa5ted> line 19-22
[08:56:30] <Doddlin> but my console.log returned undefined
[08:56:41] <wa5ted> why are you grabbing the text?
[08:56:44] <wa5ted> if they are inputs
[08:56:51] <wa5ted> val()
[08:56:53] <wa5ted> bro
[08:57:01] <wa5ted> okay
[08:57:19] <wa5ted> it should well lshow
[08:57:28] <wa5ted> since one event is run before the other
[08:57:36] <Doddlin> even with ”event” as the argument?
[08:57:52] <wa5ted> yeah it should have no issue
[08:58:00] <wa5ted> im trying to think here
[08:58:05] <wa5ted> you are getting no errors
[08:58:08] <wa5ted> can you submit?
[08:58:12] <wa5ted> and if not what error you get
[08:58:37] <Doddlin> I can submit, let me check the PHP-side
[08:59:20] <wa5ted> yup
[08:59:26] <wa5ted> see if php is returnign anything
[08:59:30] <wa5ted> probably wont but yeah
[08:59:35] <wa5ted> since useThisEmail is undefined
[08:59:43] <wa5ted> also line 12
[08:59:48] <wa5ted> remove var useThisEmail
[08:59:52] <wa5ted> since its already defined
[08:59:59] <wa5ted> just use useThisEmail = ....
[09:01:37] <Doddlin> wa5ted, you mean useThisEmail = $.ajax.....
[09:01:52] <Doddlin> ?
[09:02:38] <wa5ted> naw
[09:02:55] <wa5ted> useThisEmail = returnedEmail;
[09:03:00] <wa5ted> on line 12
[09:03:03] <wa5ted> since its already defined
[09:03:10] <Doddlin> ah, ok
[09:03:11] <wa5ted> so what are you getting
[09:03:14] <wa5ted> php wise
[09:03:23] <Doddlin> checking
[09:04:17] <Doddlin> there we go! nothing PHP-wise
[09:04:24] <Doddlin> but my email is being logged
[09:04:25] <Doddlin> :D
[09:05:39] <Doddlin> and my other values from my variables are there aswell! Thanks man! :D
[09:05:47] <Doddlin> wa5ted ^
[09:07:27] <wa5ted> Doddlin: i didnt solve anything :D
[09:07:38] <wa5ted> you need to figure out why shit isnt getting returned
[09:07:41] <wa5ted> or is it solved?
[09:08:00] <Doddlin> wa5ted, I think I’m good! Now I just need to complete my PHP-form
[09:08:03] <Doddlin> *script
[09:08:05] <Doddlin> stay tuned
[09:08:24] <wa5ted> Doddlin: im a bit of a phph nut too XD
[09:08:53] <Doddlin> wa5ted, haha, mail-scripts is what made me start PHP-coding :P
[09:09:04] <wa5ted> wow really?
[09:09:17] <wa5ted> Doddlin: i started wanting to make my own apps with mysql backend
[09:09:35] <wa5ted> so i learned it, how useless that was, nodejs became popular 1-2 years after I learned php
[09:09:39] <wa5ted> :,(
[09:09:41] <Doddlin> wa5ted, yeah, needed one for the first website I sold
[09:09:45] <Doddlin> haha, that sucks
[09:09:58] <wa5ted> template or..?
[09:11:25] <Doddlin> ?
[09:13:04] <Doddlin> wa5ted, what do u mean?
[09:13:11] <wa5ted> the website you sold
[09:13:16] <wa5ted> was it a template or a client site
[09:14:36] <Doddlin> wa5ted, aha, small custommade website
[09:14:39] <thomedy> okay..if i want to submit a form with jquery... i know there is .submit() but what concerns should i be worried about  maliciously
[09:14:40] <thomedy> csrf
[09:14:44] <Doddlin> wouldn’t showcase it… :P
[09:14:45] <thomedy> respond with token
[09:15:17] <wa5ted> Doddlin: not asking you too XD my guess the client was from clientsfromhell.net
[09:15:18] <wa5ted> XD
[09:15:36] <wa5ted> thomedy: validate input and scrub for injects
[09:15:38] <Doddlin> wa5ted, no I mean it sucked. It was truly horrible :P
[09:15:41] <wa5ted> both on client side if you can first
[09:15:44] <wa5ted> and then server side
[09:15:52] <wa5ted> Doddlin: we all improve
[09:15:59] <Doddlin> we sure do!
[09:16:10] <thomedy> okay thank you.... i have been using drupal so long and i hate it... im almost good enough to do the whole damn thing myself but im not quite there yet
[09:16:11] <wa5ted> Doddlin: this was me at 11
[09:16:13] <wa5ted> http://www.odec.ca/projects/2007/bhan7r2/
[09:16:18] <thomedy> i dont like using other peoples code at all.
[09:16:36] <thomedy> but im so busy running a retail store more than 40 hours a week and raising a family of 5
[09:16:41] <wa5ted> thomedy: i dont like it either, just like how i hate frameowkrs
[09:16:43] <thomedy> so for now... im stuck using frameworks
[09:16:49] <thomedy> yeah me to..
[09:16:49] <wa5ted> but i use grids all the time they are very useful
[09:16:56] <thomedy> i have written my own jquery plugins
[09:16:57] <wa5ted> what framework?
[09:17:01] <Doddlin> wa5ted, nice :D
[09:17:03] <wa5ted> perhaps you can download the barebones
[09:17:04] <wa5ted> http://rohan.bhangui.com/
[09:17:05] <thomedy> with straight js
[09:17:10] <wa5ted> Doddlin: ^^that is me today
[09:17:19] <thomedy> i love love creating and challenging myself but for my context... i require speed
[09:17:24] <thomedy> not creative satisfaction
[09:17:55] <Doddlin> wa5ted, that is truly great!
[09:18:47] <wa5ted> thomedy: consider bootstrap over foundation
[09:18:50] <wa5ted> unless you have the time
[09:18:55] <wa5ted> foundation is great but a tad tricky
[09:18:58] <wa5ted> to write overrides
[09:19:09] <Jattenalle> wa5ted, i liked you better at 11
[09:19:20] <Jattenalle> wa5ted, magnets and shit! now you're all about clouds
[09:19:26] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: lol
[09:19:31] <Jattenalle> what happened to you man.. you used to be attractive! now you're just water vapor!
[09:19:38] <wa5ted> lol
[09:19:48] <wa5ted> i got uglier with age XD
[09:19:58] <wa5ted> hell iwas ugly to begin with
[09:20:01] <Doddlin> hahaha
[09:20:06] <Jattenalle> :3
[09:20:13] <Doddlin> wa5ted, the php returns my whole page again -.-
[09:20:25] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: nice to meet you (dont ever think weve talked before)
[09:20:30] <Doddlin> I’ll get a simpler mail-script…
[09:20:33] <wa5ted> Doddlin: use .find
[09:20:41] <wa5ted> or similar function to shift through that
[09:20:50] <Jattenalle> wa5ted, no idea, havent been in here long
[09:20:59] <wa5ted> .filter or .find
[09:21:05] <wa5ted> Doddlin: ^
[09:21:12] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: well anyways nice to meet you
[09:21:17] <Doddlin> I see, chicking
[09:21:21] <Doddlin> checking*
[09:21:24] <wa5ted> oh btw that science fair project
[09:21:33] <wa5ted> i got sponsored 100$ by transport canada
[09:21:38] <Jattenalle> haha nice
[09:21:49] <wa5ted> i can buy 1 billionth of a peice of a maglev train yay! :D
[09:21:53] <Jattenalle> $100 at 11 is pretty huge!
[09:22:02] <Jattenalle> just think of the accumulated interest!
[09:22:13] <wa5ted> lol i wish
[09:22:19] <Jattenalle> with a good investment you could literally have half a dozen of hundreds today!
[09:22:20] <wa5ted> it was only for that project unfortunately
[09:22:21] <Jattenalle> half a dozen!
[09:22:21] <wa5ted> yeah esp. from the federal
[09:22:26] <wa5ted> transport body
[09:22:42] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: i make 100$ in 1 hour if i want
[09:22:56] <Jattenalle> well that's because you're a cloud now
[09:23:01] <wa5ted> lol
[09:23:26] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: i dunno i have always liked the idea that clouds were not clouds
[09:23:28] <wa5ted> but a bed
[09:23:32] <decx> yeah but that's canadian dollars ;)
[09:23:34] <wa5ted> almost like land
[09:23:40] <Jattenalle> decx, haha
[09:23:47] <wa5ted> decx: at the tiem us and canadian were exactly on par
[09:24:00] <Jattenalle> wa5ted, clouds are filthy lies, they're not at all fluffy and soft.. they're just ice-cold and massive
[09:24:14] <wa5ted> lol, depends on how you look at them
[09:24:21] <wa5ted> i went to hawaii
[09:24:25] <wa5ted> woke up a t 3:30am
[09:24:31] <wa5ted> to watch a sun rise above the clounds
[09:24:33] <wa5ted> clouds
[09:24:36] <wa5ted> man was it worth it
[09:25:08] <wa5ted> even at nearly freezing temperatures and elevation at about 2000-3000 feet
[09:27:25] <Jattenalle> 2k to 3k feet, what's that in real units? like 5 stone and fiften volts?
[09:27:58] <wa5ted> -_-
[09:28:55] <Doddlin> wa5ted, how come I get the full webpage echoed when I go through my mailscript?
[09:29:07] <wa5ted> well you are returning just data
[09:29:13] <decx> i googled "n feet in m" so often and i still dont know the conversion
[09:29:18] <decx> like /3 and then a bit
[09:29:28] <wa5ted> 2.56 cm to an inch
[09:29:34] <wa5ted> Doddlin: youll need to filter it
[09:29:37] <wa5ted> .filter
[09:29:39] <wa5ted> or .find
[09:29:41] <wa5ted> one of the two
[09:29:49] <Doddlin> wa5ted, I echo ”Message sent” in the mail after the function?
[09:29:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Why remember something you can look up?
[09:29:56] <decx> adding yet another unit of measurement doesnt help me
[09:29:58] <BillCriswell> I think Einstein said that haha.
[09:30:01] <Doddlin> that should be returned then?
[09:30:16] <wa5ted> why are you asking me
[09:30:20] <wa5ted> its your program XD
[09:30:23] <Doddlin> hha
[09:30:24] <Doddlin> haha*
[09:30:36] <wa5ted> wait
[09:30:40] <wa5ted> based on your script
[09:30:41] <decx> BillCriswell that's literally what we've been doing for 1.5 million years. build tools so that we don't have to work and can invent new tools that help us evade moer work
[09:30:46] <wa5ted> it should clsoe the window when you submit
[09:32:00] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm a little afraid of where that road will end up.
[09:32:14] <Doddlin> wa5ted, it does
[09:32:29] <wa5ted> okay
[09:32:31] <BillCriswell> decx: How far do you think we are from coding eachother out of jobs?
[09:32:33] <wa5ted> then why are you getting
[09:32:37] <wa5ted> "message Sent"
[09:32:42] <decx> BillCriswell idiocracy or brave new world
[09:32:43] <Doddlin> but there is no mail sent and I get the website back as response, that is usually a way to show there is something wrong :P
[09:32:44] <wa5ted> that sohuldnt happen at all i dont think so
[09:32:50] <Doddlin> wa5ted, I don’t
[09:32:57] <wa5ted> yeah so if you are
[09:33:05] <wa5ted> you need to find out why the message is not getting sent
[09:33:05] <Doddlin> I want it to echo that when mail() has been ran
[09:33:08] <wa5ted> the values are comig in
[09:33:13] <BillCriswell> I'm learning towards Brand New World. Mostly there already.
[09:33:16] <wa5ted> but there is nothign returned to the front end
[09:33:23] <Doddlin> wa5ted, true
[09:33:25] <BillCriswell> leaning*
[09:33:26] <wa5ted> so
[09:33:40] <decx> well i take some of that medication then
[09:33:43] <decx> what was it called
[09:33:44] <wa5ted> something is going on php side
[09:33:48] <wa5ted> check the error.log
[09:34:11] <wa5ted> Doddlin: please tell me you know where that is
[09:34:11] <Doddlin> wa5ted, yeah will do
[09:34:14] <BillCriswell> decx: somea?
[09:34:15] <Doddlin> I do.. ;)
[09:34:21] <wa5ted> :)
[09:34:25] <BillCriswell> Soma.
[09:34:31] <decx> soma right !
[09:34:32] <wa5ted> Doddlin: brb 10 in
[09:34:34] <wa5ted> min
[09:35:33] <Doddlin> wa5ted, yeah, I’ll be gone for a while, back later this evening
[09:35:35] <Doddlin> hopefully...
[09:35:46] <Doddlin> have a good one! Thank’s for your help! :D
[09:36:34] <phiz_> decx: soma?
[09:37:14] <phiz_> oh yeah
[09:37:34] <decx> somebody googled and didnt read irc ^^
[09:38:20] <BillCriswell> It's a pretty good google if you don't add the "brave new world" part haha
[09:38:42] <decx> womens lingerie lol
[09:39:47] <BillCriswell> It makes sense I guess.
[09:57:08] <Enissay> I have a div which I hide/show acording to cases... I wanna know if there is any weird behavior if I try to show it while it's already shown ?
[09:58:52] <BillCriswell> Watching a documentary on Napster. Pretty good so far.
[10:33:04] <jop008> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of null  my PHP returns valid json
[10:33:17] <jop008> tested manuallyy
[10:33:40] <jop008> It is an ajax call to a php which returns json string
[10:37:39] <systemfault> jop008: Without seeing any code, I can’t tell.
[10:38:08] <jop008> What do you nee tha ajax call the json string?
[10:39:03] <jop008> the ajax call http://pastebin.com/muxiZuTZ
[10:39:24] <jop008> tried with post and get
[10:39:49] <jop008> this is my curl http://localhost:8080/ezbuild/metameta/phpactions/class/metameta.php?action=show_mm_record&table=mm_couple&keyfield=mm_coupleID&key=1
[10:40:29] <jop008> throwshttp://pastebin.com/ZJPu1hvf
[10:40:32] <systemfault> Where are you trying to read the property ‘jquery’ ?
[10:40:43] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/ZJPu1hvf the json return
[10:41:22] <jop008> I don't know the message comes form jquery lib hard to see which statement with min.js
[10:42:13] <jop008> other ajax call succeeded okay
[10:42:21] <systemfault> jop008: What is dataObject?
[10:42:34] <jop008> parameters to the callback routine
[10:42:43] <jop008> in my case it is nulll
[10:42:50] <jop008> is taht a prbolem?
[10:43:20] <systemfault> Usually, just passing the object to data does the right thing, no need to manually call deparam
[10:43:35] <systemfault> Also, I don’t know what deparam does when a null is passed to it
[10:43:39] <systemfault> Err *param
[11:14:25] <tejas-manohar> are there any noders here nobody is responding in the node irc room
[11:32:33] <BillCriswell> This napster documentary is awesome.
[12:16:03] <Doddlin> wa5ted still online?
[12:16:09] <jisan> reference error function is not defined
[12:16:32] <jisan> i can't understand
[12:16:37] <jisan> i defined the function
[12:16:44] <jisan> but it's not working
[12:18:08] <jisan> does a jquery function work like any other js functions? can i trigger it from anywhere on the page?
[12:23:34] <Jattenalle> jiffe, $.someJqueryFunction();
[12:23:40] <Jattenalle> err, sorry
[12:23:44] <Jattenalle> that was for jisan
[12:24:11] <jisan> Jaternalle I'm using WordPress, jquery is working on noconflict mode
[12:24:20] <jisan> so it should be jquery.functionName()?
[12:24:34] <Jattenalle> sure
[12:24:38] <jisan> Jattenalle , sorry , mistyped
[12:24:59] <jisan> okay thank you mate, trying it
[12:49:00] <Doddlin> I need some help… I’m calling a mail-script, just a regular php-mail-function with AJAX. In the success I want it to .hide and display ”Message sent” in the log. But instead it returns the full page in the log, in HTML. Why?!
[12:49:19] <Doddlin> and, the form is actually hiding
[12:49:39] <Doddlin> so the success-function is being called but I get no mail and I get the page in the log
[12:51:59] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: Is the whole script just the function that sends mail or is it the html for the form and everything as well?
[12:52:25] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, I get the page that originally called the script back in the log
[12:52:47] <Doddlin> it’s like it’s not even accessing the mail-script...
[12:53:17] <Doddlin> and to be honest, there is no network-action logged in my dev-tools in chrome now as I think about it...
[12:53:19] <Doddlin> aah
[12:53:24] <Doddlin> hate this.
[12:54:29] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: There's so many things it could be it's really hard to tell what the issue is.
[12:54:47] <BillCriswell> If there's no action in the network tab I have no idea what's going on though.
[12:54:51] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, I can imagine…
[12:55:05] <Doddlin> no, the only network I get is the reload of the page
[12:55:29] <Doddlin> which btw should not happen I guess, since I have event.preventDefault(); in my function
[12:56:36] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: What browser?
[12:56:42] <Doddlin> Chrome
[12:57:03] <BillCriswell> Are you passing the event to the callback?
[12:57:22] <BillCriswell> $('form').on('submit', function (event) { event.preventDefault(); ... }); ?
[12:57:33] <Doddlin> yeah
[12:57:42] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you've targeted the right form?
[12:58:18] <BillCriswell> Is the document ready when you attach that listener?
[12:58:30] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, I am, but maybe I could alter the code a bit…
[12:58:41] <Doddlin> Trying a click-listener instead, hang on
[12:58:50] <Doddlin> yeah, everything ran inside DOM-ready
[13:00:01] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, same response, full HTML of the WP-page as a response… :S
[13:00:15] <BillCriswell> You're saying the page is refreshing though, right?
[13:00:18] <Doddlin> yep
[13:00:35] <Doddlin> which would suggest it is not preventing default behavior, right?
[13:01:17] <BillCriswell> Do console.log($('.selectorYouUsedForForm').length);
[13:01:25] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: Yes.
[13:01:26] <Doddlin> sure, hang on
[13:02:15] <Doddlin> log returned 1
[13:02:55] <BillCriswell> I don't knwo what you're doing then. Would need to see the code.
[13:03:15] <Doddlin> I’ll paste it on pastebin :)
[13:04:31] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, http://pastebin.com/sxL3NNqV
[13:05:13] <BillCriswell> You need to preventDefault the SUBMIT event.
[13:05:36] <BillCriswell> On the FORM
[13:06:26] <Doddlin> so, $(’#kontaktform’).submit(function….?
[13:06:38] <Doddlin> and inside that prevent?
[13:06:50] <BillCriswell> Exactly  like I showed earlier: $('form').on('submit', function (event) { event.preventDefault(); ... });
[13:08:55] <Doddlin> ok, trying
[13:09:24] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, well at least it’s not reloading
[13:09:33] <Doddlin> but still the full page as a response..
[13:09:47] <BillCriswell> What url are you sending the data to?
[13:10:17] <Doddlin> mailer.php
[13:10:22] <Doddlin> well.
[13:10:40] <Doddlin> it’s in WP, so get_stylesheet_directory_uri()/mailer.php
[13:12:14] <BillCriswell> Look at the network log in the console and see if it's doing anything weird.
[13:13:19] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, found it, give me a sec :D
[13:13:21] <Doddlin> hehe
[13:16:53] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, You were right! I don’t want to explain what was wrong. *blush*
[13:17:08] <Doddlin> *cough*wrongselector*cough*
[13:17:27] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: Looking at your JS you should change .success to .done and .error to .fail
[13:17:48] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, OK, will do! :)
[13:18:18] <BillCriswell> Also, instead of doing .val() for all of your inputs you can just do $(form).serializrArray() and use that as the data parameter in $.ajax
[13:24:52] <BillCriswell> Doddlin: When I have a similar task this is how my code typically looks: http://jsbin.com/ludirage/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:26:20] <Doddlin> BillCriswell, that’s neat indeed
[13:49:11] <Hugues_> Hi.
[13:51:04] <Hugues_> I'm looking for a way to manage another separator than "&" in URL. Does anyone have an idea/solution for this issue please?
[14:03:45] <thinkxl> Hugues_: "/" ?
[14:05:15] <thinkxl> Hugues_: how are you handling the URL right now
[14:45:45] <ewilazarus> hello! I need something to bring the attention of the user to a given div... i was looking for a plugin that would show an arrow pointing to the div. Is there anything like that?
[14:47:20] <Hugues_> Sorry thinkxl I didn't see your answer!
[14:47:49] <Hugues_> No, I was thinking to another argument separator, like ";" instead of "&".
[14:48:27] <Hugues_> The current URL are http://domain/page?arg1=val1&arg2=val2
[14:48:53] <Hugues_> And I would like something like: http://domain/page?arg1=val1;arg2=val2
[15:18:54] <Horacsio> data-anchor how many of it can I have per div?
[15:22:42] <Horacsio> any jquery form you know?
[15:39:27] <frank_o> Hello! I'm working on this SVG countdown animation. But why when you hover the outlined box, does the animation first flicker for a millisecond, then disappear, then a second later it reappears and finally starts animating? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/ -- ideally it should start animating immediately.
[15:51:32] <bjensen82> Ive changed the background on a element using .css("background", "blue"), however if I then later do a $(element).css("background"), I get the empty string, even though I know the css property is set (the background color is blue). What am I doing wrong?
[15:54:19] <bjensen82> If I do $(element).attr("style"), it shows up...
[16:07:36] <systemfault> bjensen82: Could you give us an example on jsfiddle?
[16:09:49] <systemfault> bjensen82: It returns the computed style.
[16:10:08] <systemfault> bjensen82: You might not get “blue” in return but perhaps a rgba color of the same value
[16:11:06] <bjensen82> systemfault: well turns out that I had to use css("backgroundColor") and not css("background") to get what I wanted..
[16:11:38] <systemfault> background is way more general, it contains background-image/color/position/etc...
[16:12:33] <bjensen82> systemfault: right. But it returned empty string even though it consisted of something
[16:12:43] <systemfault> Surprising :?
[16:12:45] <systemfault> :/
[16:19:10] <bjensen82> weird it works on jsfiddle; http://jsfiddle.net/rfnat3a2/ oh well
[16:21:40] <hooligan321> .prev is giving me gip
[16:23:42] <hooligan321> hmm .parent().find came to the rescue something screwy tho

[18:30:01] <Horacsio> I once used form2mail a php script... but now I dont know where can find it...
[18:30:15] <HAPPYFUNBALL> hey what is the best way to use ajaxcomplete to modify the content of the response object?
[19:30:11] <Agamemnus> Hi
[19:33:15] <Agamemnus> So
[19:33:39] <Agamemnus> nvm
[19:36:49] <Jattenalle> glad we could help!
[19:42:06] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: if only it was that easy
[19:42:07] <wa5ted> XD
[19:42:24] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: weird i cant see leaves and enters
[19:42:26] <wa5ted> on my irc client
[19:42:31] <wa5ted> Jattenalle: can yu?
[19:42:39] <Jattenalle> yes
[19:42:41] <wa5ted> hmmm
[19:42:43] <wa5ted> weird
[19:43:45] <wa5ted> in other channels i can see it
[21:05:17] <paule32> hello
[21:06:42] <paule32> i have code: function WEBUIManager() { /* ... */ }  $.webUImanager = new WEBUIManager();
[21:07:23] <paule32> but when i look in browser console, $.webUImanager is undefined
[21:07:45] <paule32> when i use: $.webUImanager.test();
[21:13:10] <paule32> what can i do to fix this?
[22:02:56] <wa5ted> paule32: it seems that the manager is not defined
[22:03:08] <wa5ted> which most probably means that you have not initiallized a script
[22:03:19] <wa5ted> particularlly the one that contains webuimanager
[23:32:11] <thomedy> submiting a form in jquery will $('input').attr('value')
[23:32:19] <thomedy> will that give me all my data
[23:32:48] <wa5ted> thomedy: dont think so
[23:32:54] <wa5ted> hey guys gotta a question
[23:33:04] <wa5ted> so i know when injecting html using .html or .append
[23:33:11] <wa5ted> for any events attached to injected html
[23:33:14] <wa5ted> you are suppose to do
[23:34:01] <wa5ted> $(".static-parent").on("click", ".injected-child", function() {...});
[23:34:07] <wa5ted> but this for some reason stopped working
[23:34:42] <wa5ted> nvm figured out my .static parent was not static but dynamically generated
[23:38:11] <thomedy> i just found (form).serialize
[23:38:15] <thomedy> it seems to do the trick
[23:38:19] <wa5ted> that could work
[23:39:29] <thomedy> i probably have to validate first and then serialize which may be for a later time... but im making progress... i need a no js fallback idea... but usually that wont be an issue
[23:47:44] <wa5ted> yes validate first
[23:47:59] <wa5ted> thomedy: what i do is do as much front end validation first as much as i can
[23:48:20] <wa5ted> and then use the backend, php in my case, to do a final check and scrub
[23:48:24] <wa5ted> for injections
[23:48:45] <thomedy> im so so so so tired... i think  im going to build this later
[23:48:50] <wa5ted> thomedy: how i do front end validation for the time being is that if there is an error
[23:48:53] <wa5ted> do an alert
[23:49:08] <wa5ted> its simple thugh not super elegant but can get your validation "working"
[23:49:18] <wa5ted> thomedy: 3 am here
[23:49:31] <thomedy> east coast for you huh?
[23:49:38] <thomedy> i am not fulll time developer
[23:49:46] <thomedy> im a full time retail manager and a father
[23:49:52] <thomedy> so i am trying to change that on my off time
[23:49:58] <thomedy> and building my own business
[23:51:15] <wa5ted> thomedy: find it commendable
[23:52:11] <wa5ted> thomedy: get some rest start back in the morning if you want
