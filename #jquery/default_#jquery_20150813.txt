[00:03:06] <arc_> can somebody recommend a resource for learning about caching with ajax, because google pretty much just returns random blogger sites and stackoverflow
[00:41:12] <arc_> all right, well this is ridiculous. unfortunately there is no way to reduce this problem to a fiddle once again
[00:42:37] <arc_> i created a secondary theme for this site, and a toggle button for it. that works fine. in fact, everything about the site works fine, until i click on a certain element and refresh the page
[00:42:49] <arc_> after that, no events seem to be bound anymore
[00:43:03] <arc_> if i refresh the page without clicking on one of those elements, it's fine
[00:43:16] <arc_> if i refresh the page without being on the light theme, it's fine
[00:43:54] <morphyeys> it's so ridiculous in the office the air conditioning is direct in front of me I am freezing everyday
[00:44:04] <arc_> so my feeling is that it has something to do with the binding that begins on line 37 here http://exilemods.com/js/poemods.js
[00:44:15] <arc_> but ... i have no idea why
[00:44:26] <arc_> i can find no syntax errors
[00:45:15] <arc_> steps to reproduce: click the contrast icon to change to light theme, click any of the categories on the left, click one of the table rows that appears, then refresh
[00:45:23] <arc_> now there are no bindings
[00:52:13] <DreamStiffler> how do i run a script once all the page in tpl has loaded it contents
[01:01:25] <arc_> nevermind, i had an extraneous return false
[01:35:04] <hellyeah> yo
[01:35:09] <hellyeah> howzit fellas
[01:35:18] <hellyeah> very quick question
[01:35:57] <hellyeah> i want to have a button when you click it it will be hided with animation. How can i d that jquery animation() can be helper?
[01:36:55] <Uhkis> why not just use fadeOut() ?
[01:37:58] <hellyeah> Uhkis: i can be fadeOut() too i am just jquery learner so try to discover stuff.
[01:39:50] <onr> embesil misin
[01:40:26] <hellyeah> evet
[01:45:00] <hellyeah> okey
[01:45:05] <hellyeah> i will look into fadeout
[01:45:08] <hellyeah> thanks
[01:48:25] <norc> Is there any difference between $.when($.ajax(...)).done() and $.ajax(...).done() ?
[01:49:10] <norc> Also, can I selectively turn off the events for a set of ajax calls?
[01:55:57] <DarsVaeda> I use $.inArray ... is this the best choice in terms of speed vs. compatibility? I'm searching in an array with 6000+ elements
[01:57:49] <norc> DarsVaeda: Write code, test it, keep it clean, profile - then worry about performance.
[01:57:50] <norc> Not before.
[01:58:25] <norc> DarsVaeda: Until then use whatever constructs that seem elegant, readable and maintainable.
[01:59:48] <DarsVaeda> I have, but I never had to handle so many elements in js/jquery, so I was wondering
[02:00:04] <Uhkis> DarsVaeda: whoa, that might take a while
[02:00:43] <norc> DarsVaeda: Have you written the code, tested it throroughly - AND profiled it?
[02:02:48] <norc> Spend your time being productive. Then use a profiler to really see where the bulk of performance is lost and optimize it. That trains you to write optimized code in the best way.
[02:02:53] <Uhkis> DarsVaeda: in terms of speed, regular for loop might be better
[02:03:10] <DarsVaeda> Well written, and tested (in the browsers I can) but profiled...I don't even know how I must admit
[02:03:42] <norc> DarsVaeda: Use the developer tools in your browser. They usually ship with a profiler. They analyze different metrics (like CPU profiles) for your JavaScript code.
[02:03:45] <DarsVaeda> norc, I was hitting more for some reaction like: "whoa 6000+? don't do that"
[02:04:07] <DarsVaeda> norc, I'll look into that thanks
[02:04:11] <norc> DarsVaeda: And Im hitting for: ignore performance. Let your profiler tell you that you can focus your attention where its needed.
[02:07:36] <norc> We have come to an age where we can afford wasting CPU cycles and memory. ;-)
[02:08:18] <Uhkis> norc: you're not one of THOSE are you? :D
[02:09:14] <norc> Uhkis: Im one of those that only uses a profiler when I notice a performance issue. Its unnecessary to make my wordpress database highly performant with 10 viewers a day.
[02:14:55] <malade_mental> Hi, When clicking on the "section" part, the script launches slideToggle on the related article : http://october.maxime.groupelarger.fr/
[02:15:26] <malade_mental> The article goes to display : block but I can't see it.
[02:15:34] <malade_mental> I think it's because of the parent "display : flex"
[02:23:29] <DarsVaeda> well inArray takes 82ms or 7% of all time in my case...
[02:29:01] <ohcibi> is it not possible to build a proper html-version of the jquery-* api documentation without wordpress?
[02:30:52] <Uhkis> ohcibi: huh?
[02:31:53] <ohcibi> Uhkis: i'm trying to build the documentation for qunit... i'm able to issue "grunt build" in the projects directory which builds html files but they have no working links and the style is missing
[02:32:35] <ohcibi> http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow <-- i have basically followed this guide but as I said without running `grunt deploy` but simply `grunt build`
[02:32:59] <ohcibi> i didnt found any other source about building jquery-* api documentation
[02:36:48] <Uhkis> ohcibi: do you want to contribute or just offline manual?
[02:37:05] <ohcibi> Uhkis: i simply want an offline version from it to create a dash docset from it
[02:38:15] <Uhkis> dash docset?
[02:38:33] <ohcibi> Uhkis: i simply want an offline version from it
[02:38:43] <ohcibi> don't bother about dash if you dont know it
[02:39:11] <Uhkis> now i know enough about it to say: how about jqapi.com
[02:42:01] <ohcibi> Uhkis: well... you asked me if I want an offline version... I said yes... are you able to tell me how to generate it? 8-)) jqapi.com seems to only contain jquery-only api.. i need jquery-qunit to be specific but i'm interested in general if its not possible without wordpress
[02:44:04] <ohcibi> plus its inofficial and still "under development" whatever this means... i simply want to build the docs offline including working links and stylesheets
[02:46:25] <Uhkis> "The best place to get help is on IRC, in the #jquery-content channel on Freenode" from the bottom of the page
[02:46:30] <Uhkis> they might be able to help you!
[02:47:03] <ohcibi> ok i'll have a look.. thanks
[02:54:00] <ohcibi> i was always wondering why jquery-projects like qunit or in earlier years also ui are so badly documented.... its insanely complicated to contribute... a running wordpress instance... with a linux-vm... to contribute for _documentation_
[03:18:47] <emporio> has someone got time to check my ajax connection within WordPress ?
[03:19:01] <emporio> Can't get it to work
[03:28:21] <emporio> Can anyone see what
[03:28:26] <emporio> 's going wrong here?
[03:28:27] <emporio> http://jsfiddle.net/au7kcr62/1/
[03:31:53] <Uhkis> ohcibi: yeah, seems a bit overkill
[03:43:30] <p2sk> emporio: there is no function named add_subscriber
[03:43:57] <emporio> p2sk: rly?
[03:44:03] <emporio> brb
[03:44:25] <p2sk> no yout function is addEmail
[03:44:42] <emporio> p2sk: yes but in Wordpress, it is required to define it like that
[03:44:55] <emporio> https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins
[03:45:29] <p2sk> yes but u add a function called "add_subscriber" but you added a function "addEmail"
[03:45:30] <emporio> p2sk: see add_action
[03:45:46] <emporio> p2sk: ok let me see. :|
[03:46:36] <emporio> p2sk: so should I rename the add_action tags?
[03:46:50] <guillaume_z> Hi everyone
[03:47:02] <emporio> add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_addEmail','addEmail');
[03:47:05] <emporio> to that?
[03:47:28] <p2sk> add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv','addEmail');
[03:47:44] <p2sk> i would guess
[03:48:00] <emporio> ok let me try
[03:49:08] <guillaume_z> i’m stuck on a jquery mobile on the filterable widget.
[03:49:23] <emporio> p2sk: that didn't help unfortunately
[03:49:39] <emporio> p2sk: thx for the reply though
[03:49:44] <emporio> guillaume_z: hi
[03:49:47] <p2sk> i am cecking my code
[03:50:08] <emporio> p2sk: would you like to download the project on github ?
[03:50:17] <p2sk> no
[03:51:23] <guillaume_z> When i come a second time on the same page, the filterable widget doesn’t hear the keyboard events. I’ve checked if  the« filterablebeforefilter » was binded to the element and yes it’s binded but it doesn’t work...
[03:52:26] <guillaume_z> emporio: hi !
[03:52:47] <p2sk> emporio: http://jsfiddle.net/au7kcr62/2/
[03:53:06] <hellyeah> yo
[03:53:15] <hellyeah> why button does noıt dieappear slowly http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/1/
[03:54:02] <p2sk> hellyeah: because you dont have a button with the id buttonClass
[03:54:09] <p2sk> # = id, . = class
[03:54:11] <hellyeah> damn
[03:54:17] <hellyeah> always did same mistake
[03:54:31] <guillaume_z> hellyeah: Try this instead http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/2/
[03:54:46] <p2sk> and after the click you can use $(this) to refer to the same object
[03:55:45] <hellyeah> how can i give one more animation button will be invisible with shaking to left to right, right to left
[03:56:02] <hellyeah> p2sk: i forgot that too everytime
[03:56:16] <hellyeah> p2sk: must be about lack of practicing
[03:56:27] <hellyeah> do you understand what animation i am talking about
[04:01:11] <hellyeah> fadeout get some mparameters
[04:01:23] <hellyeah> can i give those for easing in fadeout http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[04:02:22] <emporio> guillaume_z: sorry guillaume, I'm stuck myself..
[04:02:32] <emporio> p2sk: just had a bite to eat
[04:03:53] <guillaume_z> emporio: No problems
[04:04:03] <emporio> p2sk: that's kind of what I already did, I'm going to try your way though..
[04:05:26] <emporio> p2sk: that still doesn't create a user.. :\
[04:09:55] <hellyeah> it said effect is not a function http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/11/
[04:10:59] <hellyeah> this is the tutorial https://api.jqueryui.com/shake-effect/
[04:11:40] <hellyeah> why that didnt work
[04:13:54] <hellyeah> any idea?
[04:14:53] <Uhkis> hellyeah: you don't have jquery UI in that fiddle
[04:15:00] <hellyeah> really
[04:15:21] <Uhkis> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/13/
[04:15:23] <hellyeah> Uhkis: i have jquery 2.1.3 http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/12/
[04:15:29] <hellyeah> DMN let me check
[04:15:50] <Uhkis> jquery UI is not a part of jquery itself
[04:16:01] <hellyeah> ow yeah
[04:16:03] <hellyeah> ui sorry
[04:16:12] <hellyeah> why button looks different when animating
[04:16:15] <hellyeah> ?
[04:16:45] <p2sk> emporio: yes, because you are doing js wrong
[04:17:00] <guillaume_z> hellyeah: Download https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ and use it with classes on your elements. You’ll just have to addclass, removeClass
[04:17:14] <emporio> p2sk: which part is wrong ?
[04:17:15] <guillaume_z> Doing it with jquery UI is not necessary anymore
[04:17:21] <p2sk> https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins#Separate_Javascript_File
[04:18:10] <hellyeah> thanks guillaume_z that will help alot one last question how can i mix these two animatrions http://jsfiddle.net/308rq9bp/16/
[04:18:42] <p2sk> please read the whole "Introduction" again
[04:18:59] <hellyeah> me?
[04:19:16] <hellyeah> guillaume_z: i am just discovering stuff
[04:19:18] <p2sk> no emporio
[04:19:23] <hellyeah> total noob
[04:19:34] <hellyeah> animat.css can be cool
[04:20:09] <hellyeah> guillaume_z: one question https://jsfiddle.net/d7bjjqh8/70/ can i do it slowly when you click button it will close and open so fast
[04:20:19] <hellyeah> can i do it with animate.css
[04:20:29] <emporio> p2sk: ok I will read it again
[04:20:32] <guillaume_z> hellyeah: For mixing animations you have to your with CSS or use delay property
[04:21:47] <hellyeah> you have to your with css
[04:21:53] <hellyeah> where is the verb?
[04:22:03] <guillaume_z> hellyeah: Try to do use 1 animation from animate with jquery. And after use your brain to find how to chain or even mix them :)
[04:22:15] <hellyeah> :XD
[04:22:30] <hellyeah> i can use both animation respectively right now
[04:22:59] <hellyeah> i am sure quick googline can give me result
[04:23:04] <hellyeah> i will download animate.css
[04:23:09] <hellyeah> for sure thanks
[04:23:50] <guillaume_z> hellyeah: My pleasure ! Enjoy
[04:24:37] <hellyeah> :D
[04:25:23] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1251300/how-to-run-two-jquery-animations-simultaneously
[04:27:33] <hellyeah> anyway i can check later.
[04:56:19] <emporio> p2sk: is the url correct?
[04:56:33] <emporio> the examples provided in the documentation are not relevant enough
[04:56:40] <emporio> they use .post and not .ajax
[04:56:58] <emporio> jQuery.post(ajax_object.ajax_url, data, function(response) {
[04:56:58] <emporio> 		alert('Got this from the server: ' + response);
[04:56:58] <emporio> 	});
[04:57:20] <emporio> p2sk: and what od i fill in here?
[04:57:21] <emporio> ajax_object.ajax_url
[04:57:46] <Uhkis> emporio: dont multiline paste on irc. also post is just a shorthand for POST type ajax()
[04:57:51] <FernandoBasso> I am using .clone(). A child element of the cloned element has a click event attached. I tried .clone(true) and .clone(true, true), but none seem to copy the click event. Am I missing something?
[04:59:26] <Uhkis> FernandoBasso: latter should work
[05:00:03] <FernandoBasso> Uhkis: Yes, and when I look at the dev tools, the original child of the cloned element has the click, but the cloned one does not.
[05:00:06] <FernandoBasso> I'll check some more.
[05:00:38] <FernandoBasso> $itemOrig = $('.item').clone(true, true); $('#docs-wrap').append($itemOrig);
[05:00:57] <FernandoBasso> Could it be that .append() is causing it to lose the click event?
[05:02:47] <FernandoBasso> And I logged the just copied element, and it does not have the event attached. jQuery 1.11.1
[05:05:14] <p2sk> emporio: ajax_object.ajax_url is correct
[05:05:36] <emporio> p2sk: but don't i need to replace that with a link to the php file?
[05:05:48] <p2sk> NOTE: Since Version 2.8, The JavaScript global variable ajaxurl can be used in case you want to separate your JavaScript code from php files into JavaScript only files. This is true on the administration side only.
[05:05:56] <Uhkis> FernandoBasso: you might've found a bug then
[05:07:22] <p2sk> emporio: but you should join wordpress for wp specifiy questions
[05:07:25] <Uhkis> FernandoBasso: does the child have id? that might cause it
[05:07:33] <emporio> I am on there..
[05:07:42] <FernandoBasso> Uhkis:  Nope. I was careful about that.
[05:07:47] <FernandoBasso> I'm creating a fiddle.
[05:09:51] <FernandoBasso> Uhkis: It was my fault.
[05:10:14] <FernandoBasso> The handler was added a block below the one that clones the element.
[05:10:32] <FernandoBasso> By the time it was cloned, the event had just not yet been attached.
[05:11:32] <FernandoBasso> Uhkis: You question about the id made me recheck the code, which lead me to spot that. Thanks.
[06:02:29] <norc> Hi. Why does this not log an object containing the properties foo: 1 and bar: 2? http://jsfiddle.net/j6nzva7y/
[06:02:57] <norc> (And yes there is a reason why Im using an extra deferred)
[06:04:51] <taplar> o1 and o2 don't have those properties on them
[06:05:34] <norc> taplar: The thing is the arguments to the deferred callbacks are different when I pass multiple deferred objects to $.when
[06:06:22] <taplar> looks like atleast off of o1 foo is inside the first element
[06:07:05] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/j6nzva7y/1/
[06:07:19] <norc> taplar: Yes but why.
[06:09:01] <norc> http://jsfiddle.net/grtpa116/
[06:09:02] <norc> This works.
[06:09:54] <norc> My example from above works fine with a single ajax promise as well. But when using multiple ajax promises, the deferred callback argument gets wrapped inside an array
[06:10:10] <norc> That is, master deferred callback.
[06:11:05] <taplar> from the ajax documentation it shows that the done function for $.ajax can take parameters of (data, textStatus, jqXHR) so for your case it looks like it's giving you the objects each as an array of those values, respective to their call
[06:15:37] <norc> taplar: Which seems to be incorrect.
[06:15:46] <norc> As I said, with a single promise it passes the object directly for json.
[06:15:47] <norc> http://jsfiddle.net/j6nzva7y/3/
[06:17:58] <taplar> yeah, that's weird
[06:19:12] <taplar> oh i wonder
[06:19:46] <taplar> hah! that's it
[06:20:03] <taplar> since your only doing one promise in the one case, it's actually sending in all three pieces
[06:20:14] <taplar> data, status, xhr
[06:21:04] <taplar> so if there are multiple, it sends arrays in with the data for the respective calls, but for a single where you don't have to know what data goes with what call, it just sends the elements in on their own
[06:27:14] <norc> taplar: Which would mean that when seriously messes with the promises.
[06:27:30] <norc> taplar The ajax promise does not do magic,
[06:29:16] <norc> in the end according to the $.ajax documentation the done callback has the following signature: jqXHR.done(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {});
[06:29:32] <taplar> i'd agree.  looks like it was implimented to exclude the extra array wrapper when it could vs consistent input structure for done
[06:33:52] <tumulte> is find('.foo').click() possible ?
[06:34:00] <taplar> tumulte: sure
[06:34:16] <tumulte> taplar: so I go a problem somewhere else
[06:34:29] <taplar> $(selector).find('.foo').click()
[06:34:37] <taplar> or just $('.foo').click()
[06:34:42] <tumulte> taplar: of course. Just got very lazy :)
[06:34:48] <taplar> k
[06:34:54] <taplar> just making sure, :)
[06:35:19] <tumulte> taplar: that's always a good thing
[06:38:21] <norc> taplar: what do you base that assumption on?
[06:38:36] <norc> taplar: There is no indication that there should be an array in the first place.
[06:46:40] <taplar> sorry, stepped away
[06:47:00] <taplar> wan't meant to be an assumption as your code example was doing that
[06:47:08] <taplar> *wasn't
[06:47:35] <taplar> $.when(a, b).done(x, y); x and y were console loging as Array objects
[06:51:36] <taplar> if you want to take a deep dive into what it's actually doing you can refer to http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.when
[06:57:24] <tumulte> taplar: I believe it's because the element is dynamically created. Therefore can work with click
[06:57:57] <taplar> hmm?  you can click dynamically created elements
[06:59:21] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/kkqz341u/
[07:00:35] <taplar> now, if your trying to find dynamically created elements before their attached to the dom, and your not doing the find on a parent they are attached to, yeah, that'd be a problem
[07:00:37] <tumulte> taplar: I'm so very afraid I do
[07:01:43] <tumulte> taplar: I'll just extract the href
[07:02:36] <norc> taplar: only if a and b are promise objects from ajax.
[07:02:44] <norc> That is the whole bizarre thing about it.
[07:03:06] <norc> Ive been looking at the jquery source code for half an hour now, but havent understood how this can happen
[07:14:43] <Meenu> Hi
[07:15:10] <taplar> norc: not saying i complete understand what it's doing either, but from a quick glance I would think the difference might start in the updateFunc where is assigns values[i]
[07:15:29] <taplar> hey Meenu
[07:15:46] <Meenu> I am new in jquery, Can any one tell me, how should i start learning jquery
[07:16:02] <taplar> Meenu: there is a try.jquery.com site that you can take a look at
[07:16:18] <Meenu> i have read lot about jquery
[07:16:34] <taplar> other than that, think of something you want to do and just start tinkering and trying to make it work
[07:16:52] <taplar> and if you have questions, you can ask here
[07:17:34] <Meenu> I am intermediate in javascript it is ok
[07:17:58] <Meenu> or should i expert
[07:18:49] <taplar> cool, js experience will help you a lot.  at that point your just looking up things in the api mostly, :)
[07:19:44] <Meenu> ok thanks tapler for your valuable help
[07:20:41] <taplar> meh, don't say that until it helps you, :)
[07:30:34] <KEHN> hi hi
[07:30:52] <KEHN> anyone able to help with jquery ui draggable
[07:32:24] <taplar> just ask the room, if anyone can help they'll pipe in, :)
[08:08:45] <pu239> what would cause $('#some-id').height() to return 0? it's visible on the screen
[08:09:09] <pu239> but if i hide it, $('#some-id').hide(), then get the height again it gives me a value
[08:09:57] <Shaggoth_> weird
[08:10:26] <pu239> i feel like it has to be something simple i'm overlooking
[08:10:38] <taplar> fiddle?

[08:13:15] <mbrzuzy> `ULT google around about javascript scope
[08:13:58] <`ULT> thanks, will take a look
[08:17:00] <NoiseEee> http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/ @ `ULT
[08:17:45] <NoiseEee> `ULT if you're just asking the difference between "x" and "$(x)" though....
[08:17:46] <pu239> got it figured out, a child element had float:left and was goofing it up
[08:18:05] <NoiseEee> `ULT: "this" is the bare DOM element in your question,  $(this) is the jquery object representing the element.
[08:18:18] <NoiseEee> and therefore has all the jquery methods and fun stuff available to it
[08:19:30] <KEHN> with jquery ui drag + drop, how do i get the data of the element i just dropped in the drop zone ?
[08:20:59] <`ULT> thanks guys, I am a nubbie in programming and I don`t undertand exactely $(this) so that is the reason why I was asking for a good source.
[08:21:13] <monk12> hey all, quick question... i insert html returned by a service like so $(currentFocusedElem).after(data); ... now its the next sibling of the currently selected element. I would like to add a class to it... but i cant seem to do $(data).addClass('selected'); ... whats a good way to do that?
[08:22:10] <NoiseEee> monk12: find the first element of whatever "data" is and add it to that
[08:23:38] <monk12> NoiseEee: cant i just use the orig jquery node as a reference and find the next sibling by using that (versus a new selector just for the data item)?
[08:23:46] <monk12> maybe next()?
[08:24:40] <NoiseEee> monk12: data is surely your response as a string
[08:24:52] <NoiseEee> monk12: so no, you have to find an element to add a class ot it
[08:25:15] <NoiseEee> but perhaps $(currentFocusedElem).next() will work, depends on the DOM setup i guess
[08:26:57] <monk12> hmmmm well this worked: $(currentFocusedElem).after(data); 				$(currentFocusedElem).removeClass('selected'); 				$(currentFocusedElem).next().addClass('selected');
[08:34:48] <`ULT> I have this Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/4/
[08:36:25] <`ULT> when selecting options the value`s will be added in var sum
[08:36:51] <`ULT> but now I want something else: I want only the values added in the selected row
[08:37:20] <`ULT> can i achieve this with $(this) ?
[08:37:55] <`ULT> values = data-price
[08:45:57] <bk_0> Hey. New to jquery. I'm trying to accomplish a collapsing table. Using code from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16926752/expand-collapse-table-rows-with-jquery However, the link behaves like an anchor and move the view to the top of the page. Using the Firefox debug, I'm also getting this message: Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead., even though...
[08:45:59] <bk_0> ...that code (in a <script> tag) has been removed from the page.
[08:46:58] <bk_0> First thing I'm trying to figure out is why that old code would still seem to be active on the page. Is there some caching mechanism?
[08:52:04] <robertmaxrees> bk_0 browsers can cache things, yes - that's why you have a "hard refresh" option usually.
[08:52:56] <robertmaxrees> bk_0 there might be also things in other code using that, so you can often ignore warnings like that.
[08:54:15] <bk_0> Thanks. It only comes up when clicked.
[08:55:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you're not using it, don't worry too much.
[08:56:29] <bk_0> OK. Any idea why the anchor link would still act as an anchor rather than an action?
[08:57:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code.
[08:58:32] <bk_0> OK, thanks. Its a bit big. I'm going to try removing things to id any conflicts.
[08:58:41] <robertmaxrees> just replicate the basics.
[08:59:54] <robertmaxrees> bk_0 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ub5qq6hc/1/ basic event binding/management is pretty simple.
[09:01:52] <bk_0> Should jquery scripts live in the head or body, or are both OK?
[09:03:51] <robertmaxrees> *javascript files, and depends on who you ask
[09:04:02] <robertmaxrees> generally, put them right before the closing body tag as much as possible.
[09:12:07] <bango2> can someone give me a quick selector, select all input:checkbox that dont have an id attribute
[09:12:16] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[09:12:31] <bango2> how would i use filter to define those that dont have ID
[09:12:49] <robertmaxrees> check $(this).prop('id') in the callback.
[09:16:46] <shoky> :not([id])  should also work
[09:16:57] <shoky> and this.id plz
[09:17:01] <robertmaxrees> or this.id
[09:17:03] <robertmaxrees> either/or.

[09:27:35] <jak2000> hi why not add a item to select option: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t188gq1j/9/ thanks
[09:27:53] <robertmaxrees> ('#myselect').append('<option val="1">One</option>');
[09:27:54] <robertmaxrees> missing $
[09:28:23] <jak2000> right
[10:10:52] <jamie_ca> Hi all, I'm trying to debug some craziness with rails ajax forms, traced it deep into jquery but can't figure out what's going on
[10:11:14] <robertmaxrees> usually the issue is with the way you're using something - what's the error?
[10:11:40] <jamie_ca> it's doing a normal $.ajax call with serialized form data, and somewhere along the way it's turning the data (array of Objects) into emptystring
[10:12:04] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code?
[10:13:02] <jamie_ca> like, if I go all the way down into jQuery.extend, console.log(target) gives me an object dump where data: "", but on the immediately following line console.log(target.data) is still my expected array...
[10:13:22] <robertmaxrees> jamie_ca the issue is very likely not actually inside of jquery.
[10:13:28] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm curious to see your code.
[10:14:50] <node9> Hi. I'm having problems with ajax on nginx. I'm trying to setup a vBulletin forum on nginx server. Everything works except registration where it does an ajax call and that returns as 500 server error and the initiator is jQuery. Has anyone ever had any experience setting up vbulletin on nginx?
[10:14:57] <jamie_ca> robertmaxrees: $.ajax(options), where options looks like http://take.ms/T3icC
[10:15:04] <node9> I'm guessing it's something to do how nginx handle ajax calls
[10:15:15] <robertmaxrees> node9 500 means it's something inside of the server.
[10:15:17] <node9> since I uploaded exactly the same file structure on apache server and everything went fine
[10:16:02] <robertmaxrees> node9 sounds like a server config issue.
[10:16:23] <robertmaxrees> jamie_ca that's not helpful - stringify the data and share that in a bpaste or something.
[10:16:32] <jamie_ca> sure
[10:16:42] <node9> robertmaxrees yep I suppose since the files work great on apache. I'm just curious if anyone have had any problems with ajax on nginx and where does it fail usually
[10:16:56] <robertmaxrees> node9 if it's a 500 error, server-side.
[10:16:56] <node9> I've been spending hours on this issue, can't figure out, redid the nginx rewrites but no luck
[10:17:00] <robertmaxrees> ie, not a jquery issue.
[10:19:21] <taplar> ^ if you don't believe this and want to double/triple check this, you can test your raw request in developer tools like RESTful for firefox or cREST for chrome
[10:19:43] <robertmaxrees> taplar they said everything worked fine when they used apache.
[10:19:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:19:58] <taplar> just giving a non jquery option to test, :)
[10:20:05] <robertmaxrees> if swapping out the webserver breaks things, sounds like the server is the problem.
[10:21:32] <node9> taplar, robertmaxrees - I suppose the answer I was looking for is whether anyone has run in to some ajax parsing issues on nginx servers because that's probably what's happening here.
[10:21:51] <taplar> uh, servers don't parse ajax
[10:21:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:21:56] <taplar> they handle requests
[10:22:03] <taplar> they don't know the origin method
[10:22:03] <node9> yeah, sorry about the terminology
[10:23:20] <jamie_ca> robertmaxrees: thanks for the pointer - just tried $.ajax(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(options))) which strips out my callbacks, but _does_ post the correct data https://gist.github.com/jamie/739edeb2bbe6c6460423
[10:23:33] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:23:44] <jamie_ca> definitely something crazy outside jquery. dammit.
[10:23:54] <jamie_ca> "errr." exactly my reaction
[10:24:02] <jamie_ca> been driving me nuts several days now...
[10:24:10] <node9> I'm getting 500 error on POST on url/registration/registration and the initiator is jquery for: send, f.extend.ajax
[10:24:14] <robertmaxrees> i was reall just looking for the options object.
[10:24:36] <robertmaxrees> node9 what happens when you hit that URL directly?
[10:24:39] <jamie_ca> yeah, that gist is the options object
[10:24:52] <node9> robertmaxrees {"error":"insufficient data"}
[10:25:00] <robertmaxrees> node9 :)
[10:25:11] <robertmaxrees> jamie_ca except it's not since json can't contain callbacks.  i'm looking for your actual code :) sorry, should've clarified.
[10:26:18] <node9> robertmaxrees, also, before that I get another error -
[10:26:22] <node9> registration/checkusername?username=aspdkjaksdjlk&securitytoken=guest Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
[10:26:28] <robertmaxrees> node9 so then the issue is not with jquery :)
[10:26:53] <robertmaxrees> node9 i'd hit up a support channel w/r/t the application or nginx or whatever
[10:27:53] <node9> Yeah, I can't really use the application support forums since it's nulled vbulletin. I guess i'll have to bug #nginx guys
[10:28:03] <robertmaxrees> probably ;)
[10:28:20] <node9> Thanks for this either way! ;)
[10:29:44] <jamie_ca> robertmaxrees: my actual code is... just rails.
[10:30:07] <robertmaxrees> jamie_ca you're not generating js with ruby, are you?
[10:30:15] <jamie_ca> hell no
[10:30:18] <jamie_ca> just using https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery_ujs.js
[10:30:20] <robertmaxrees> then you should have some js
[10:30:31] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're using some kind of automated setup?
[10:30:49] <KEHN> how do i get # of li elements in an ol ?
[10:30:59] <robertmaxrees> KEHN $('ol li').length
[10:31:12] <KEHN> let me try
[10:31:13] <taplar> might want >
[10:31:19] <taplar> if you have nested lists
[10:31:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:31:35] <jamie_ca> robertmaxrees: yeah. the relevant hook is line 424 in my last link, but I don't want you to debug rails' code
[10:32:04] <robertmaxrees> jamie_ca yeah i'd suggest hitting up one this repo's maintainers or something in that case.
[10:32:14] <jamie_ca> yeah
[10:32:30] <KEHN> the problem is am adding the elements to an ol, then trying to count
[10:32:37] <robertmaxrees> KEHN that's fine.
[10:33:04] <KEHN> $('.blender-container ol li').length   returns only 1
[10:33:17] <robertmaxrees> KEHN then you have one item that matches that selector.
[10:33:21] <KEHN> even if more than 1 item is dropped
[10:33:32] <robertmaxrees> share your code then.
[10:33:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might be appending things incorrectly.
[10:34:05] <KEHN> 1sec
[10:34:59] <jamie_ca> robertmaxrees: thanks for your time, though

[11:12:01] <taplar> i guess that makes my box a diynasa
[11:13:16] <woobywoob__> hello
[11:13:24] <taplar> aloha
[11:13:56] <woobywoob__> im having a problem of double submissions here https://gist.github.com/michaelryu/7b197698a4e4339674fc
[11:14:31] <woobywoob__> anyone know a clean way to solve it?
[11:14:54] <woobywoob__> i just pulled this from bootly because i needed an embedded stripe form
[11:15:15] <taplar> which one is double subing?  both?
[11:15:57] <woobywoob__> there is only one form
[11:16:31] <taplar> so $("#payment-form"); and $('form.require-validation') are the same?
[11:17:25] <woobywoob__> yes
[11:17:33] <woobywoob__> lol i should change that
[11:18:01] <taplar> :/
[11:19:33] <woobywoob__> yeah im mostly a backend guy so i just pulled this from bootly
[11:23:48] <hlvwrk> i thought you said booty.
[11:23:54] <hlvwrk> I was gunna say "OH HEY NOW"
[11:24:12] <taplar> what do you have against ba-dunk-a-dunk?
[11:27:47] <KEHN> hi again
[11:28:00] <KEHN> firstly, am struggling to get the example working on jsgiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/fjvo7jue/2/
[11:28:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[11:28:47] <KEHN> getting the drag and drop to work on jsfiddle
[11:28:53] <KEHN> then i can ask my probloem
[11:28:56] <KEHN> problem*
[11:30:23] <taplar> walking away, but does the dropzone ol have a min width and min height to let you drop into it?  haven't messed with droppable much
[11:31:13] <woobywoob__> so anyone have an answer for me for the double submit thing?
[11:31:15] <robertmaxrees> $(".item-lists li").draggable(); - this doesn't look like it's actually selecting anything.
[11:32:46] <KEHN> checking doc 1 sec
[11:33:00] <robertmaxrees> woobywoob__ what's the issue?
[11:33:21] <woobywoob__> robertmaxrees im having a problem of double submissions here https://gist.github.com/michaelryu/7b197698a4e4339674fc
[11:33:32] <robertmaxrees> could you be more specific?
[11:33:43] <robertmaxrees> maybe setup a jsfiddle showing the problem?
[11:33:43] <woobywoob__> form is prone to double submit
[11:34:16] <robertmaxrees> $form.get(0).submit();=
[11:34:30] <robertmaxrees> *$form.get(0).submit(); this looks like your culprit.
[11:35:00] <woobywoob__> hmm is that wrong?
[11:35:16] <robertmaxrees> that's submitting the form.
[11:35:34] <robertmaxrees> you have a code path on the first handler that doesn't preventDefault(), and then you have that.
[11:35:37] <robertmaxrees> sooo, that'd cause it.
[11:36:09] <woobywoob__> would the fix be to erase it?
[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what all your code is doing/trying to do so sure?
[11:36:32] <woobywoob__> frontend is so confusing
[11:36:41] <robertmaxrees> this looks really cobbled together.
[11:36:50] <woobywoob__> yeah i got it from bootly
[11:37:01] <robertmaxrees> KEHN your HTML is items-list li, not item-lists li
[11:37:13] <robertmaxrees> also, those versions of jquery/jquery ui look bugged on jsfiddle.
[11:37:20] <woobywoob__> kehn?
[11:37:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking to somebody else :)
[11:37:30] <woobywoob__> so
[11:37:33] <woobywoob__> lol
[11:37:40] <robertmaxrees> KEHN http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjvo7jue/4/
[11:38:18] <woobywoob__> robert there is a preventdefault on line 19
[11:38:33] <robertmaxrees> right - that doesn't mean it'll run ;)
[11:38:46] <robertmaxrees> that only runs if ($input.val() === '') {}
[11:39:11] <woobywoob__> huh
[11:39:14] <robertmaxrees> woobywoob__ you should  probably refactor all of this - whjat are you trying to actually do.
[11:39:16] <KEHN> lol let me look i was just fiddling
[11:39:22] <bongjovi_> I have a function that initializes lots of different things that gets run after ajax calls etc, what's the best way to use this as a 'controller' so I can pass variables to it and initialize only specific items? Here is a really basic example: https://jsfiddle.net/wrbjkfv4/
[11:39:35] <bongjovi_> I want to be able to just change say, .one, .four, .seven
[11:39:38] <woobywoob__> trying to embed a stripe form
[11:39:45] <KEHN> was it the jquery options?
[11:39:53] <woobywoob__> im not a master of refactoring jquery
[11:39:55] <bongjovi_> Obviously I'm not just changing div bg colors...
[11:40:00] <woobywoob__> not a master of jquery at all actually
[11:40:04] <robertmaxrees> woobywoob__ *javascript.  jquery isn't a language ;)
[11:40:23] <KEHN> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:40:24] <woobywoob__> sure but jquery sure does make javascript look weird
[11:40:27] <robertmaxrees> KEHN it was the stuff in the upper left and your selector.
[11:40:36] <robertmaxrees> woobywoob__ not really.  still just a bunch of function/method calls.
[11:40:59] <KEHN> thx
[11:41:02] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi_ i'm lost - are you trying to only set css for something you pass into init()
[11:41:28] <bongjovi_> robertmaxrees, yeah exactly, although in the real application i'm not setting css
[11:41:33] <woobywoob__> i guess i'm not a master yet. i can only see the patterns in ruby
[11:41:46] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi_ but you're trying to dynamically select things?
[11:41:55] <woobywoob__> im not at the point where the differences to the eye is just syntaxes
[11:41:58] <robertmaxrees> woobywoob__ JS is a neat little language - it can take some getting used to.
[11:42:07] <robertmaxrees> very different concepts in some ways from ruby though,.
[11:42:34] <woobywoob__> idk people say when they git good that most languages come easy to them
[11:42:52] <robertmaxrees> basically
[11:43:03] <bongjovi_> robertmaxrees: yeah, for example i'd like to be able to do something like $('.one, .two, .seven).init(); or init('.one', .'two', '.seven');
[11:43:28] <bongjovi_> but there is a different function associated with each of those elements
[11:43:41] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi_ that's a really strange way to do it.
[11:44:00] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe flesh out the example a bit better, then
[11:44:02] <bongjovi_> haha, i feel like i'm not thinking straight
[11:44:16] <bongjovi_> i will have another think
[11:44:16] <robertmaxrees> you're making something really overly complicated.
[11:45:04] <bongjovi_> yeah maybe so :)
[11:45:29] <fxmulder> anyone know if there is a way to make datatables not do anything if the ajax call fails?  it seems to clear the table
[11:46:47] <woobywoob__> is there a service where i can hire a frontend guy for a small job
[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> check out #freelance
[11:47:01] <woobywoob__> if not that should be a startup idea
[11:47:24] <woobywoob__> like a webapp where you can paired instantly
[11:47:37] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, that's a shifty idea.
[11:48:09] <woobywoob__> almost a meme term at this point but "like airbnb" you get trusted helpers
[11:48:14] <woobywoob__> and they'll cost more or something
[11:48:27] <robertmaxrees> so some developer suddenly gets in touch with somebody without an idea of the kind of work, money, how long it'll take...
[11:48:56] <woobywoob__> no it will be small tasks
[11:49:02] <robertmaxrees> according to whom? ;)
[11:49:21] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue.  it looks like you're building a payment page - that doesn't sound necessarily like a "small task"
[11:49:26] <woobywoob__> hmm i guess the worker gets to decide if its worth the time
[11:49:58] <woobywoob__> you are correct, it'd be much easier to just use stripe's given checkout function
[11:52:01] <robertmaxrees> or learn frontend development :)
[11:52:03] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:53:03] <chriys> hi all, how do I access a property of a ajax object ? I received something like this Object {_id: "55cc8e18221550", name: "Asperiores"}
[11:53:08] <chriys> I wan to access name
[11:54:24] <supsup> data["_id"] ?
[11:54:48] <supsup> or data["name"]
[11:54:51] <supsup> or data.name
[11:55:30] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay
[11:55:33] <supsup> success Type: Function( Anything data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[11:56:00] <chriys> supsup: I can access name but not _id
[11:56:11] <woobywoob__> wb robert
[11:56:15] <chriys> I can do it by doing this data[0].name
[11:56:36] <supsup> data[0]["_id"]
[11:56:37] <KEHN> thanks so far
[11:56:47] <chriys> supsup: thanks it works
[11:57:18] <chriys> why the first way only works for name ?
[11:57:18] <KEHN> now my actual question: i was trying to get the selected items list after a button is clicked and the count: http://jsfiddle.net/fjvo7jue/11/
[11:57:29] <supsup> cause _ not allowed i think
[11:57:42] <supsup> or by using _ you have to do it the other way
[11:57:51] <robertmaxrees> KEHN do what?
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> KEHN open your console and click that button.
[11:58:49] <KEHN> got the errors
[11:58:59] <robertmaxrees> so fix the error.
[11:59:20] <supsup> hurm i guess _ is legal to start with
[12:00:14] <supsup> from mozzila:  property must be a valid JavaScript identifier, i.e. a sequence of alphanumerical characters, also including the underscore ("_") and dollar sign ("$"), that cannot start with a number. For example, object.$1 is valid, while object.1 is not.
[12:01:02] <KEHN> so i cant type into the console normally on jsfiddle?
[12:01:43] <robertmaxrees> KEHN not really.
[12:04:18] <KEHN> i remember what i was trying to do now
[12:04:19] <supsup> chriys:  not sure why you can't use dot notation seems to work in simple case:  http://jsfiddle.net/yLbkuw4x/
[12:04:36] <chriys> oh ok cool
[12:06:30] <supsup> is there always just 1 array object returned chriys?  if so make it return back a single object instead of an array of objects
[12:06:36] <supsup> but that's just me
[12:06:43] <supsup> i think it's ugly when there is array with 1 obj
[12:06:51] <chriys> supsup: well I'll have multiples objects.
[12:06:57] <supsup> ah ok
[12:07:54] <supsup> is it bad that when that happens I return an object with a single property that's value is the array of objects ;-0?  like { "itMe" : [{},{}]  }
[12:18:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:19:10] <taplar> an element of a key with an array of empty objects looks weird, but then again, it is without context
[12:19:21] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:19:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd just return an empty array at that point.
[12:19:34] <robertmaxrees> fulfill that contract.
[12:20:00] <supsup> naw i mean the objects would be full
[12:20:10] <robertmaxrees> so they would have data in them?
[12:20:14] <supsup> i should of done {...}
[12:20:23] <supsup> yeah
[12:20:35] <robertmaxrees> if the data structure calls for it...
[12:21:20] <supsup> i''m just anti array i think, not very logical.
[12:21:25] <supsup> i know i just moved it down
[12:21:26] <robertmaxrees> arrays are awesome.
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> .map(), .some(), .every(), etc.
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> neat stuff
[12:22:25] <KEHN> when returning a .className  and returning more than 1, how do i select the first class
[12:22:39] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting them?
[12:22:49] <robertmaxrees> and define "first"
[12:23:13] <KEHN> well when i run:                 console.log(ui.draggable.context.className);
[12:23:22] <KEHN> i am provided with a list of classes
[12:23:42] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to see if an element has a particular class?
[12:24:04] <KEHN> am trying to get a class from an li
[12:24:41] <robertmaxrees> what're you going to use it for?  because trying to get "the first class" out of a list of them is code smell.
[12:24:44] <KEHN> so i can then add it to another element
[12:24:58] <KEHN> need to rethink this
[12:24:58] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[12:25:01] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:25:06] <KEHN> its good
[12:25:20] <KEHN> questions my silly logic
[12:40:16] <taplar> lol, that user name is not feasable
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:40:34] <taplar> pragmatism:
[12:40:40] <pragmatism> ?
[12:40:46] <taplar> i'm being stupid
[12:40:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> taplar - the resident... comedian?
[12:41:12] <taplar> one person always laughs
[12:41:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't count yourself :P
[12:41:34] <onr> taplar: hahaha that's awesome
[12:41:46] * onr applauds
[12:43:58] <onr> <awkward silence>
[12:48:37] <taplar> dang it
[12:48:45] <robertmaxrees> gosh darn it.
[12:48:46] <taplar> i could have said 'i can't count so it's a mute point'
[12:48:50] <taplar> *sigh*
[12:49:19] <taplar> come on 3:00
[12:53:51] <chriys> hi all, how do you guys handle image resize on L5 ?
[12:54:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:54:48] <onr> is L5 a CMS written in PHP?
[12:55:05] <taplar> $*^% acronyms...
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> chriys do you mind clarifying your question?
[12:55:44] <onr> ooh, i'm close! L5 is a web framework written in Personal Home Pages
[12:55:51] <robertmaxrees> lols get it
[12:55:58] <taplar> redundant
[12:56:03] <taplar> personal home
[12:56:24] <pedahzur> Howdy. JS beginner here. Not quite newbie, but certainly beginner. :)  I've been reading up on JSON Web Tokens, and really like them. I'd like to use them, but am not writing a "single screen" JS application. So, I would need to store the JWT when it arrives at the browser (probably in localstorage), and then pull it out on every click and send it along with the request.  Capturing the click can probably be easily accomplished with $('
[12:56:26] <pedahzur> a').click( function {.........}). Will also have to take into account button clicks.  1) What is the best way to append headers to an outgoing request? 2) Is there a better way to do this (other than going to a full single-screen app?
[12:56:27] <taplar> i like me some stranger home pages
[12:56:35] <chriys> well now I just upload images, but I heard that I should resize them before uploading them otherwise I could get surprises in uploaded image. I also want to make sure that every upload image have a certain ratio. I never done that, so I'm wondering what would be the solution for that
[12:56:45] <robertmaxrees> chriys what is "l5" supposed to be?
[12:56:55] <onr> Laravel 5
[12:56:57] <chriys> L5 = Laravel 5
[12:57:09] <onr> chriys: this is jquery programming language
[12:57:09] <chriys> oh snap wrong channel sorry
[12:57:10] <robertmaxrees> chriys oh, ask ina channel about laravel or php in that case :)
[12:57:15] <onr> maybe you should ask in #laravel
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> onr *library - not a langauge :)
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> pedahzur "append headers" to an ajax request ooor...?
[12:57:57] <taplar> pedahzur: fwiw the term is SPA
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> pedahzur also, what does your question have to do with tokens?
[12:58:11] <onr> mmm i love massage
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> oh i get it.
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> pedahzur why are you using json web tokens.
[12:59:01] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: Not an AJAX request, just a normal request. Tokens need to be sent with the request, but aren't automatically, so... :)
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> why are you using JWTs?
[12:59:46] <pedahzur> taplar: Ah, right...single-page application. Thanks.
[12:59:57] <taplar> ^_~
[13:00:17] <taplar> boom 3!  later all
[13:00:57] <onr> beware that JWT might be a trademarked brand of a Java framework
[13:01:34] <onr> speaking of java, i miss the days i go into #java and ask javascript questions on purpose
[13:02:01] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: Why not?  Like cookies, but able to store more info. This: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token and this: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of what they are, but i'm curious to know what you're using them for.
[13:02:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could include that as apart of the URL for a GET request (which it looks like you're going to use them for) but that's kind of gross.
[13:03:04] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: authn/authz
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use JWT for auth fwiw.
[13:03:40] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: Well, not so much for auth, that's user/pass. But once signed in, they get a JWT.
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> why not use sessions?
[13:03:58] <robertmaxrees> like anybody else does?
[13:04:16] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: less data to store, lookup, etc. server-side.
[13:04:34] <onr> maybe it's better than all alternatives?
[13:04:46] <robertmaxrees> JWTs are just meant to sign data - you're looking for session management.  two different concepts.
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> and JWT will stil require as much effort, but make UX kind of a pain since you'll have to append a weird string to the end of every URL.
[13:05:23] <robertmaxrees> that string will effectively be that user's "keys" to the app apparently.  see where that falls aparty?
[13:12:03] <acidjazz> why we taokin JWT's in here
[13:12:05] <acidjazz> talking*
[13:12:42] <acidjazz> thems for OAuth
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> thems for signing data ;)
[13:13:59] <acidjazz> i agree with robertmaxrees i just dont konw if pedahzur knows what hes doing
[13:14:09] <acidjazz> but yea i agree a session token will do just fine
[13:14:44] <acidjazz> my tool comes in handy down this road pedahzur
[13:14:45] <acidjazz> https://github.com/acidjazz/summon
[13:15:36] <acidjazz> need to update the read me with composer info
[13:32:01] <pedahzur> acidjazz: Yeah, it's totally possible I don't know what I'm doing. :) I like being able to store a lot of data in a JWT (or whatever kind of signed cookie you want).  I could do a "JWT-ish" thing and push it down as a cookie, but might hit length limits.
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> pedahzur you should really store that info server-side.
[13:32:48] <robertmaxrees> with simple session management :)
[13:43:09] <pedahzur> robertmaxrees: K...I'll think about that.
[13:50:47] <KEHN> hi again
[13:51:09] <KEHN> trying to count the items in the ol with .length  : http://jsfiddle.net/fjvo7jue/12/
[13:51:26] <KEHN> counts to 1 then stops counting as you drag + drop items
[13:52:17] <KEHN> where am i going wrong
[13:52:31] <robertmaxrees> it's correct - <ol class="items-selected"></ol> - there's only a single element with that class.
[13:52:38] <acidjazz> peder: when sessioning you really wanna just exchange a token, not actual information
[13:53:00] <acidjazz> ah hes gone
[13:53:02] <KEHN> if you add 2 elements / drag + drop
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> KEHN you still only have that one element.
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> that couns how many elements match that selector.
[13:53:23] <KEHN> oh
[13:53:28] <KEHN> that is where am going wrong
[13:53:49] <KEHN> that is not what i wish to do,
[13:54:07] <Kirito> When accessing data attributes, is it better to use data() or attr()? Or does it matter?
[13:54:21] <Kirito> I know it's better to use attr when setting data, but I don't know if data is at all more efficient
[13:54:28] <Kirito> (For retrieving that is)
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> .data()
[13:54:48] <robertmaxrees> it'll be faster.
[13:55:44] <robertmaxrees> KEHN http://stackoverflow.com/a/8449497/923919
[14:00:15] <KEHN> thx
[14:26:43] <CodeRebel> im an oldschool irc user that I have recently downloaded irc for the first time in 10 years.  can anybody assist me in what's changed and some good developer communities?
[14:26:54] <NoiseEee> CodeRebel: not much has changed :)
[14:27:07] <CodeRebel> awesome
[14:27:16] <CodeRebel> is freenode the server of choice for developers now?
[14:27:22] <NoiseEee> CodeRebel: yes, for sure
[14:29:26] <CodeRebel> thank you noise
[14:29:36] <CodeRebel> any recommendations of a php channel I can join, I need some assistance
[14:30:15] <robertmaxrees> ##php is where you want to be.
[14:37:31] <fxmulder> so when using datatables, I am using an ajax datasource.  If an error occurs the source returns a 400 and I have an error handler.  This all seems to work fine except when using paging, the ui shows the page correctly but if I click the next button again it takes me two pages ahead
[14:37:33] <acidjazz> the CODEREBEL moves on
[14:37:51] <fxmulder> seems some page counter was incremented somewhere even though an error occurred
[14:37:56] <acidjazz> fxmulder: .fail() is fired btw if you use jquery's $.get
[14:38:00] <acidjazz> fxmulder: on 400's
[14:38:19] <acidjazz> i always use $.get with .always(), .success(), and .fail()
[14:38:32] <fxmulder> datatables makes the ajax call internally
[14:39:01] <KEHN> is there a way to apply : .prop('disabled', false);  to 2 elements at once instead of having to repeat the code?
[14:39:02] <acidjazz> wat
[14:39:36] <fxmulder> and ajax isn't the problem
[14:39:53] <fxmulder> something inside datatables is incrementing a counter when it shouldn't be
[14:40:10] <fxmulder> it recognizes the error state because it is calling my error callback
[14:40:43] <shoky> KEHN: you can just run that on a jquery object that has both elements. e.g.  $('.item').prop('disabled', false)
[14:40:47] <fxmulder> probably something better taken up on their forums I'm guessing
[14:40:49] <acidjazz> wahts this db, this doesnt really seem like a jquery thing
[14:41:53] <fxmulder> its a jquery plugin
[14:41:55] <KEHN> shoky the parent element
[14:41:56] <KEHN> ?
[14:42:13] <shoky> KEHN: no. select both elements
[14:42:46] <shoky> e.g. if you're selecting them by id's then  $('#id1,#id2').prop(..)
[14:43:02] <KEHN> arr comma seperation works with selectors ?
[14:43:22] <shoky> yes it means "or"
[14:43:43] <KEHN> i didnt know comma seperation was possible for selectors, jesus
[14:43:50] <KEHN> thanks
[14:44:14] <shoky> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[14:44:30] <KEHN> am super rusty, started learning again
[14:50:31] <KEHN> is it worth putting every selector  / $()   into a variable ?
[14:51:40] <Max-P> KEHN: If you're reusing them frequently, yes. $() is relatively expensive, while storing the result is basically free
[14:52:25] <Max-P> Twitter has a problem with that at one time, putting *one* selector in a variable made scrolling go from 5fps to an actually smooth scrolling
[14:53:34] <KEHN> so $('.test').addClass('.disabled');   is most costly than
[14:53:47] <KEHN> var test = $('.test');  test.addClass('.disabled');
[14:53:48] <KEHN> ?
[14:55:18] * KEHN still trying to learn
[14:55:52] <shoky> KEHN:  $('.test').addClass('.disabled');  $('.test').addClass('.disabled');     is more costly than:   var test = $('.test');  test.addClass('.disabled');  test.addClass('.disabled');
[14:56:17] <shoky> because in the 1st one you're doing $('.test') twice,  and in the 2nd one you're only doing $('.test') once
[14:56:52] <jphase> also an aside: keep in mind that it'd most likely be .addClass('disabled') instead of .addClass('.disabled')
[14:58:59] <acidjazz> fxmulder: what is it?
[14:59:15] <`ULTsleep> hi
[14:59:33] <ZeuZ> Got a question regarding this: http://pastebin.com/2PBsBLEf ---> It doesn't work due to the fact that it does not take and leave an anonymous functino each time, or am I doing it wrong? I know I could go adding each one hand on, but I wanted to try it this way
[15:00:03] <`ULT> i`m stalled
[15:01:22] <`ULT> can someone take a look to my problem?
[15:01:44] <ZeuZ> `ULT, I'm seeking for help myself, but what's your problem? Maybe I can help out
[15:02:33] <`ULT> oke thx ZeuZ, thank you!
[15:02:53] <`ULT> I have made this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/5/
[15:03:42] <`ULT> When you select an option (or more) the dataprice from the option is added
[15:04:22] <KEHN> but what if you know you only need to add one class
[15:04:37] <KEHN> $('.test').addClass('disabled');
[15:04:42] <`ULT> But now I want something else: the total data-price from the selected options in a row (and not the total data-price for all the selected options)
[15:05:08] <ZeuZ> `ULT, if I where you, I'd set a div for that data
[15:05:09] <`ULT> i tried some things with $(this), filter and closest
[15:05:26] <KEHN> i understanding calling it twice is more costly, but if your calling it once, surely it is less than also setting and calling a variable
[15:06:09] <`ULT> and how should you do that KEHN?
[15:06:25] <`ULT> *ZeuZ
[15:06:30] <KEHN> jaja
[15:06:43] <ZeuZ> KEHN, spanish-talker aight? :P
[15:06:48] <ZeuZ> (that makes two of us then)
[15:08:03] <KEHN> not really
[15:08:10] <KEHN> just the odd ja ja je je
[15:08:29] <ZeuZ> Oh :( I was starting to feel like I'm not alone (??)
[15:08:37] <KEHN> hola
[15:08:44] <KEHN> well u know js
[15:08:51] <ZeuZ> "know"
[15:09:03] <ZeuZ> I don't consider myself profitable in js
[15:12:31] <shoky> KEHN: as we've said, it only matters if you use it multiple times. don't run $('.test') more than you need to
[15:13:44] <`ULT> ZeuZ
[15:13:49] <`ULT> do you have a suggestion?
[15:14:36] <ZeuZ> `ULT, not as of yet, gimme a sec, trying to fix my problem first :P
[15:14:46] <`ULT> okido haha
[15:14:53] <`ULT> sorry!
[15:15:02] <rs4> hi all
[15:15:06] <`ULT> I need to sleep, than I wil try again tommorow
[15:18:14] <acidjazz> i have a question ALL SHALL FREEZE
[15:18:34] <acidjazz> im writing code tghats sort of in a .scroll handler.. and i ned to detect if certain elements are below or above my viewport
[15:25:14] <acidjazz> gs
[15:47:03] <KEHN> than ks
[15:47:10] <KEHN> making sense abit
[15:47:35] <Max-P> acidjazz: You'll have to use .offset() on it, and compare it to the body's scroll position and viewport size
[15:58:09] <acidjazz> so .offset on the div
[15:58:13] <acidjazz> and offset on body?
[16:01:19] <Dr-007> i've got a pretty simple question i think, but i cant spot the problem. here's my code: http://pastebin.com/1EExezeN  my xkey: 'year' doesn't work in my non-commented new Morris.line(). it does work in the commented example in the bottom of the function
[16:01:24] <Dr-007> i cant figure out why
[16:02:02] <Dr-007> data.data has the year and value inthere via json. that works like a charm
[16:03:37] <Dr-007> oh never mind
[16:20:24] <KEHN> hi again
[16:21:33] <KEHN> having trouble trying to select the dropped items  img elements src
[16:22:02] <KEHN> http://jsfiddle.net/fjvo7jue/13/   JS - line 18
[16:27:05] <acidjazz> ive got an even narlier question. i have an element which position is fixed, can i somehow detect the color of whatever is currently behind it? image or not? i want to updated this fixed element and make sure it contrasts
[16:27:33] <shoky> KEHN: what's the problem with line 18?
[16:30:28] <shoky> KEHN: ui.draggable.find('img').attr('src')
[16:31:28] <shoky> KEHN: and ui.draggable.text()
[16:36:30] <lindii_> is there any channel for zurb foundation.. damn so many bugs
[16:39:33] <KEHN> thanks let me have a go, been trying to solve this for awhile now
[16:42:52] <KEHN> works thanks
[16:43:08] <KEHN> i was using ui.draggable.context.textContent  instead of your ui.draggable.text()
[16:43:43] <KEHN> thanks
[16:43:59] <KEHN> where to start learning again, js or jquery center ?
[16:44:13] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[16:44:28] <robertmaxrees> KEHN jquery learning center is a good place to go.
[16:45:22] <KEHN> ill try that before i start over on js
[16:46:02] <KEHN> would it be correct to put the data it 2 variables:   var ingredImg = ui.draggable.find('img').attr('src'), ingredName = ui.draggable.text();
[16:46:21] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "correct?
[16:46:33] <KEHN> good practice?
[16:46:43] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to use them, yes.
[16:46:45] <KEHN> or bad technique
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> there's an even better way to do it.
[16:47:36] <KEHN> i cant remember all these jquery options method etc
[16:47:39] <KEHN> madness
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> you'll start to.
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> with practice.
[16:48:00] * KEHN gets out a huge pad
[16:49:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:49:58] <KEHN> for notes to help remember
[16:50:11] <robertmaxrees> oh haha.  it comes with experience, too.
[16:50:11] <KEHN> i comment code a lot too
[16:51:00] <robertmaxrees> more and more you'll start understanding what's going on and get used to it.
[16:51:58] <tasaif> anybody interested in taking my job for 36k teaching intro to web dev?
[16:52:02] <tasaif> it's in Fremont
[16:52:09] <robertmaxrees> not really a good place to ask ;)
[16:52:12] <KEHN> Fremont?
[16:52:24] <tasaif> sorry :p
[16:52:30] <KEHN> what does it cover exactly
[16:52:39] <tasaif> I'll pm you

[16:52:46] <KEHN> oky
[16:54:58] <tasaif> robertmaxrees, is there a #general for jquery?
[16:55:46] <robertmaxrees> this is technically it, but what are you advertising?
[16:56:03] <tasaif> the job that I'm leaving
[16:56:41] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, feel free to network and stuff.  i just get uncomfortable when people start doing lots of job hunting and stuff.
[16:57:14] <robertmaxrees> like... the channel is primarily about jquery and getting support for it, y'know?
[16:57:45] <tasaif> I understand
[16:58:40] <tasaif> thanks :D
[17:09:04] <Utils> It's a drag to have to do .off for every .on that you do (if you change view, you will need different listeners). Is there a way to store an array of listeners bound and unset them all automatically wihtout having to manually do it?
[17:10:57] <robertmaxrees> Utils why are you needing to unbind and rebind?
[17:11:40] <robertmaxrees> that seems really unusual to me.
[17:14:33] <Utils> Well, basically it's a chat client and the views differ. Certain listeners may use elements or objects that don't exist in other views. Take this for example: http://pastebin.com/0bUAD3hs .chat-emoji-bar wouldn't exist if the chat view wasn't loaded.
[17:14:57] <Utils> Potentially you could do checks to see if things exist before using them... but that causes more code complexity?
[17:15:15] <Utils> I just figured that you'd remove listeners, if they're completely useless at that point.
[17:15:17] <robertmaxrees> then use delegated listeners
[17:20:13] <Utils> is that when you pass a select? my pastebin shows how that would not be sufficient in certain circumstances.
[17:21:19] <Utils> Is there a performance issue by binding and unbinding?
[17:21:21] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', 'body', function(e){ you don't need to do this btw.
[17:21:27] <Utils> I don't?
[17:21:30] <robertmaxrees> and juggling your bindings is really hard to reason about.
[17:21:43] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', function(e){ is identical to what you have in your fiddle since you're reading the e.target
[17:22:42] <robertmaxrees> and this doesn't need to be unbound.
[17:23:59] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/f86a3bef854d you could just do this and leave it bound without issue.
[17:26:26] <Utils> Oh. It won't complain that it's trying to hide an element that doesn't exist?
[17:26:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:26:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks that for you.
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> you could add in an extra bit of logic for that if you really wanted.
[17:27:38] <Utils> hmm... is there a case whereit would complain if the element doesn't exist? I've always believed that it would.
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:28:12] <Utils> Hmm... so why did I think otherwise. I've no idea.
[17:28:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zkktw6nn/
[17:29:56] <Utils> interesting. well that certainly helps, thanks!
[17:30:02] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[17:31:41] <Utils> If you have two listeners for the same selector, is it best to keep them separate or to combine them if possible or does it not really matter?
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> kind of depends on what they're doing.
[17:35:59] <Utils> That one above, and I have one almost similar for another element
[17:36:00] <KEHN> is this code correct:   $('.revealitems img').attr('draggable', false);
[17:36:26] <robertmaxrees> Utils i'd keep them separate.
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> KEHN .prop() in that case.
[17:36:42] <KEHN> i am expecting it to add the attr draggable to all img elements that are descendents of .revealitems
[17:36:58] <KEHN> what is attr used for then
[17:37:03] <KEHN> classes?
[17:37:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> you use .addClass() and .removeClass() for classes.
[17:37:25] <robertmaxrees> generally you want .prop() instead of attr.
[17:37:39] <robertmaxrees> unless you're reading image sources.
[17:37:39] <KEHN> thanks
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> and you want .prop('draggable', true)
[17:37:50] <robertmaxrees> not false.
[17:38:35] <KEHN> oh
[17:38:47] <robertmaxrees> false removes it.
[17:39:05] <KEHN> tried both still an img is draggable
[17:39:16] <robertmaxrees> oh you're trying to remove the draggable from jquery ui?
[17:39:24] <KEHN> yah
[17:39:29] <KEHN> dragged item is dropped
[17:39:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#method-disable
[17:39:35] <KEHN> i dont want the used to drag the img
[17:39:40] <KEHN> and think they are dragging the item
[17:39:44] <KEHN> user*
[17:40:06] <KEHN> disabled the dragging
[17:40:31] <KEHN> need to disable drag of the img, if that makese sense, i dont want them to save it or move it around when its in position
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:40:50] <robertmaxrees> api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#method-disable
[17:40:54] <robertmaxrees> already showed you this ;)
[17:41:05] <KEHN> am on it 1 sec, was just finishing explaining
[17:42:46] <KEHN> strange the newly added item's img is still draggable
[17:43:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:43:02] <robertmaxrees> you have a fiddle?
[17:43:13] <KEHN> n/m ill try something then get my data on a fiddle
[17:45:53] <Utils> robertmaxrees: what's the advantage to keeping them separate? just cleanliness?
[17:45:58] <robertmaxrees> readability.
[18:08:00] <KEHN> draggin an img is not the same as dragging a draggable element is it?
[18:16:08] <acidjazz> unless you mkae hte img draggable
[18:16:13] <acidjazz> or teabaggable
[18:16:23] <onr> oh what is teabaggable?
[18:17:51] <KEHN> ok thats not important right now
[18:18:34] <KEHN> when i drag and drop items , how can i access a list or array of elements added
[18:18:40] <KEHN> a raw list
[18:23:06] <onr> srsly, is "teabaggable" actually a thing?
[18:23:15] <KEHN> no
[18:23:35] <KEHN> he played too many games
[18:23:54] <onr> :(
[18:24:29] <onr> i imagined it like a super-awesome UI paradigm that will change the way we drag & drop things :(
[18:29:43] <KEHN> i need to make jquery toolbox
[18:29:48] <KEHN> may help me learn
[20:10:30] <KEHN> is $(".blender-container ol").droppable({    called a function
[20:10:50] <KEHN> and  drop: function(event, ui) {   is a method?
[20:53:06] <acidjazz> who knows aspect ratio math
[21:47:45] <acidjazz> is it possible in js to get the color of a certain coordinate on my viewport, say 1 pixel?
[22:01:03] <Uhkis> probably not without canvas
[23:24:45] <jac0bz1> Anyone know what this hover effect is called? http://ad-hoc.bold-themes.com/agency/portfolio-wide/
[23:26:23] <Max-P> jac0bz1: I don't think it has a name. It's really just a hover effect that follows the cursor. Maybe a slide in hover effect if you really want to name it
[23:37:35] <FearDread> greetings
[23:39:22] <Max-P> {$welcome}
[23:39:53] <Shaggoth_> hello world
[23:43:22] <parveen> how to unbind if click is already binded
[23:44:04] <Max-P> parveen: $.off() ?
[23:45:32] <parveen> inside the function Max-P ?
[23:46:52] <parveen> i have  -   $(document).on("click", "#addtaskbtn" + sub_event_id, function () {  });
[23:46:59] <parveen> i call this function many times
[23:47:20] <Max-P> parveen: I don't understand your use case. What exactly do you want to do?
[23:48:01] <parveen> here  -  $(document).on("click", "#addtaskbtn" + sub_event_id, function () {  });  if sub_event_id  sometimes binded twice
[23:48:22] <parveen> and this function part works twice on on single click
[23:49:47] <Max-P> Humm, I guess you'd have to keep track of what sub_event_id you bind and not bind twice
[23:49:59] <parveen> yes how
[23:50:06] <Max-P> Or use a class instead, and then use $(this).prop('id')
[23:51:22] <parveen> Max-P  not getting this $(this).prop('id')
[23:52:27] <Max-P> parveen: $(document).on('click', '.addtaskbtn', function() { var sub_event_id = $(this).prop('id').substr(1); /* do something */});
[23:52:36] <Max-P> This way you bind only once
[23:55:12] <parveen> Max-P  it will not help
