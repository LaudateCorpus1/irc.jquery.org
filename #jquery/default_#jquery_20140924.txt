[00:05:39] <lilsammy> Cork thats not moving it at all
[00:05:47] <lilsammy> this is for an element that slides down
[00:05:58] <lilsammy> I wanted the window to scroll down as it slides down
[00:08:55] <Cork> lilsammy: http://jsfiddle.net/c6ydujfu/
[00:09:27] <lilsammy> Weird :/
[00:09:54] <lilsammy> I am using it here as you have: http://www.veruspetroleum.com/build/ you click one of the more info sections and it should scroll down?
[00:13:15] <jim87> hello! I'd like to bind a handler of the click event of any element in a website, and then unbind from them all once it's being executed (and only that handler, not all onClick ones)... is it possible? AFAIK $().one will bind the function once for each element, not for one execution
[00:13:31] <Cork> lilsammy: you can't use offset on a display: none element
[00:13:55] <Cork> lilsammy: display: none elements isn't drawn so they don't have accurate measurements
[00:14:11] <Cork> lilsammy: also moreinfo is already a jquery object
[00:14:15] <Cork> no need to wrap it again
[00:15:43] <lilsammy> ah right
[00:15:49] <lilsammy> that makes sense
[00:20:24] <lilsammy> That works better if I put it after the slide down
[00:44:39] <lilsammy> Anyone used the waypoints plugin?
[00:44:55] <lilsammy> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[00:45:09] <lilsammy> having problems with hidden elements effecting the position of waypoints
[01:08:48] <mooncup> morning guys
[01:09:00] <mooncup> I was wondering if anyone could explain to me why this isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/ja3y4jr9/1/
[01:12:23] <Kingsy> if I have a string object how do I go about getting the primitive value? it almost lookst like an array of characters in the console.. which is weird
[01:13:07] <xec> make up your mind, is it a string or an object
[01:14:14] <Kingsy> it looks like an object.. it looks like this --> [String, constructor: function, init: function, selector: "", jquery: "1.7.1", size: function…]
[01:14:33] <Kingsy> rather than just text
[01:14:35] <xec> mooncup: yes, you are using the variables before they are set to a value
[01:14:51] <xec> mooncup: http://jsfiddle.net/ja3y4jr9/2/
[01:15:19] <mooncup> ahhh
[01:15:20] <xec> Kingsy: ok, that looks like a jquery object. show us your code
[01:15:27] <mooncup> wonderful, thanks xec
[01:17:09] <xec> mooncup: if you don't use assignment you're fine too http://jsfiddle.net/ja3y4jr9/3/ because function declarations are hoisted to the top
[01:18:10] <Kingsy> xec: for example --> http://pastie.org/9590047
[01:19:11] <xec> Kingsy: what exactly is that code supposed to do? addition is a string and you're doing $.each() on it?
[01:19:34] <xec> nevermind, theres a split
[01:19:49] <xec> so it's an array. of what?
[01:19:55] <xec> links?
[01:20:20] <xec> i suggest you try console.log(this) and see what you get
[01:20:37] <Kingsy> ok 1 second
[01:21:27] <Kingsy> its weird, it looks like an array of characters like this
[01:21:27] <Kingsy> String {0: "b", 1: "l", 2: "a", 3: "c", 4: "k", gsub: function, scan: function, truncate: function, strip: function, stripTags: function…}
[01:21:36] <Kingsy>  its supposed to just say "black"
[01:22:48] <xec> ok, what is addition before the loop?
[01:23:23] <Kingsy> nothing it is declared in that statement
[01:23:29] <Kingsy> oh sorry
[01:23:32] <Kingsy> totally misread
[01:23:40] <lilsammy> Anyone used "Inview"
[01:23:42] <lilsammy> ?
[01:24:28] <mooncup> xec: yeah I think that's what threw me
[01:24:32] <mooncup> I normally use decs instead
[01:24:56] <Kingsy> xec: its an object
[01:25:14] <xec> Kingsy: how about you make a demo with the relevant markup
[01:25:33] <Kingsy> yeah might be a good way forward.
[01:25:43] <Kingsy> I'll have another quick look around.. see if it jumps out at me
[01:25:53] <Kingsy> I have never seen something like that before.
[01:27:19] <xec> well, if you try console.log(new String("black")); you'd get that result
[01:27:43] <Kingsy> ah I see..
[01:27:45] <xec> but i don't know what exactly is going on in your code there
[01:28:44] <Kingsy> thanks for looking.. I will see what I can find, and make an example if I cant get it
[01:31:54] <lilsammy> anyone got a sec?
[01:32:34] <xec> lilsammy: if you have a question, just ask it
[01:32:46] <lilsammy> I think I may of been premature 2 secs lol
[01:32:49] <Koopz> !about asking
[01:32:58] <xec> ?ask
[01:32:58] <b-ot> xec: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:33:05] <Koopz> ah yes
[01:33:09] <Koopz> wrong channel :P
[01:33:13] <xec> :D
[01:33:53] <xec> i wasn't sure that command was going to work anymore, i haven't been active here in a while
[01:34:29] <lilsammy> ¬_¬ ok here goes that didn't work.
[01:35:19] <lilsammy> I have an element that slides down, when I scroll past this element and another comes into view this should slide up but it moves the page and I wand to stay at the same place which triggered the slide up.
[01:36:09] <lilsammy> http://www.veruspetroleum.com/    if you click the "View More" on the orange band along the bottom and then scroll past it to the next bit you will see what I mean
[01:39:05] <Koopz> gee... i'd sure like to know why my bootstrap-select used in a modal doesn't refresh while it works when i do it in jsfiddle
[01:40:18] <lilsammy> I don't use jsfiddle because of the different results I end up with when used in a live environment now
[01:40:47] <Hooloovoo> lilsammy: What do you mean?
[01:41:01] <lilsammy> about jsfiddle or the previous question?
[01:41:06] <Hooloovoo> jsfiddle
[01:41:11] <xec> that's half the point. making a demo helps figure out what part of your application causes the error
[01:41:35] <lilsammy> Oh well half the time when im mocking things up in jsfiddle then put them in a live site they change in what the output is :/
[01:41:38] <Hooloovoo> Ya, most people who set up a jsfiddle properly solve the problem before they even finish the fiddle.
[01:42:25] <lilsammy> Probably because of different scripts etc who knows I can't be assed looking into it
[01:42:48] <xec> lilsammy: you can't be arsed but we should be? :)
[01:42:58] <lilsammy> No
[01:43:00] <Koopz> oh funny... it seems like the AJAX-request is the problem...
[01:43:05] <lilsammy> I didn't say anyone should xec
[01:43:25] <lilsammy> I meant investigating my problem with jsfiddle I just don't use it thats all I was saying
[01:43:57] <Hooloovoo> Fair enough. You'll probably have a hard time finding help if you can't be arsed setting up a test case for your problem though.
[01:44:24] <xec> things aren't always what they seem
[01:44:28] <xec> ?elephant @ lilsammy
[01:44:28] <b-ot> lilsammy: http://i.imgur.com/yjiefcs.gif
[01:44:41] <lilsammy> I am not asking for help ... I was just making a point about what Koopz said about his test case behaving differently in jsfiddle
[01:45:13] <Koopz> because i can't reproduce exactly what i'm doing in my environment o3o
[01:45:13] <fRAiLtY-> lol at that gif
[01:45:30] <lilsammy> Yeah that gif was funny
[01:45:57] <xec> the most useful bot command ever xD
[01:53:27] <Koopz> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[01:53:45] <Koopz> ...i... i copied the example
[01:53:47] <lilsammy> Uhhhhhh "dat problem"
[01:54:18] <ggdevelop1> hi I hane HTML code in my script and I want to make it a downlod file for users? how can I do so?
[01:55:19] <shebbi> Hi, I'm trying to redirect within a jQuery Dialog after a successful ajax function, but what is happenning is that the redirect page simply gets loaded into the Dialog. Help
[01:57:37] <shebbi> Should the redirect be done on the client-side?
[01:58:01] <lilsammy> window.open(url, title, options);
[01:58:13] <lilsammy> oh redirect
[01:59:08] <Koopz> windows.location?
[01:59:11] <Koopz> window*
[02:02:27] <xec> Koopz: yeah be careful with that. assigning to windows overwrites your entire desktop i think
[02:06:33] <mooncup> do object tags absorb click events?
[02:06:45] <lilsammy> Oh anyone know if what I want is possible? http://jsfiddle.net/JzWNa/6/
[02:06:54] <mooncup> I have a form label, that when clicked will check a radio
[02:07:08] <lilsammy> click the red bit, it expands, when scrolling and the bottom of the green comes into view it will slide up
[02:07:26] <lilsammy> I want the page to stay in the same position and not scroll
[02:07:33] <mooncup> but when an object tag inside the label is clicked, nothing happens
[02:07:34] <lilsammy> not scroll from that position I mean
[02:08:17] <lilsammy> well you wont be binding the click to things inside will you?
[02:10:56] <Koopz> not sure why... but the jsfiddle api won't deliver me an anser to my request...
[02:11:06] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/678eLa0o/4/
[02:11:19] <Koopz> answer*
[02:12:23] <Cork> Koopz: you need to json encode the data
[02:13:53] <Cork> also your data is malformed
[02:14:11] <Cork> Koopz: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html#json
[02:14:12] <mooncup> morning Cork
[02:14:15] <Cork> o/
[02:15:36] <lilsammy> Cork you got a sec I don't need an answer just need to know if what I am trying to do is even possible
[02:15:46] <ruby_on_tails> why is the .position() of an element same no matter what margin i apply to it?
[02:16:06] <lilsammy> http://jsfiddle.net/JzWNa/6/   can you keep the page from scrolling when an element slides up?
[02:16:29] <lilsammy> I tried to save to position and scroll to it but it doesn't seem to work
[02:17:12] <dANO> Hi, what is the best way for in ajax reload a tr ? or actually the class of this tr ?
[02:17:20] <Cork> lilsammy: what cause the page to scroll up is cause the page hits the bottom of the scrollarea
[02:17:29] <lilsammy> I know
[02:17:29] <Cork> lilsammy: so the scrollbars can't go futher down
[02:17:35] <lilsammy> oh
[02:17:41] <Cork> only way to get around that is to add extra space
[02:24:16] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/678eLa0o/14/
[02:24:37] <Koopz> Cork, i'm starting to feel like an idiot

[03:26:21] <SurajVerma> Kartagis: No problem buddy. :)
[03:26:44] <mooncup> hm it seems the only way to fire a click event on an object/svg is to hide it under a transparent div
[03:26:50] <mooncup> does anyone know of a less crappy solution?
[03:27:46] <SurajVerma> Koopz: Can you help in this please ?
[03:28:36] <Koopz> i can't help you either that's why i haven't reacted yet
[03:30:26] <SurajVerma> Koopz: Okie. :(
[03:30:48] <Koopz> mooncup, could this maybe help you? https://github.com/RedBrainLabs/jquery.wrap-svg
[03:31:40] <mooncup> thanks Koopz I shall take a look
[03:32:02] <mooncup> hm that looks like it's for actually manipulating the svg
[03:32:12] <mooncup> I'll take a look as a backup option
[03:32:25] <mooncup> but all I really want to do is bind a click event to an object tag containing an svg
[03:32:27] <eigentor> Any experienced Colorbox users: there is the cool function colorbox.resize, which resizes Colorbox to the content inside
[03:32:37] <eigentor> but it has an animation, and I do not want that animation
[03:32:41] <eigentor> wonder how to get rid of it
[03:33:17] <eigentor> obviously one has to call the function because Colorbox has so many divs that have element styles on it
[03:33:48] <Koopz> don't know if the issue still exists but as far as i understood is that SVG DOM and HTML DOM are too different and that's why using selectors on SVG elements in jquery doesn't work
[03:34:35] <mooncup> yeah I was reading about that
[03:34:38] <HowardwLo> cant you popstate the whole HTML ?
[03:34:46] <HowardwLo> why do the little parts?
[03:34:48] <mooncup> but what I can't work out is why that would affect clicking on the object
[03:35:06] <mooncup> I don't want to go into the svg dom, I want the same click event wherever you click
[03:35:18] <mooncup> just $('object').click()
[03:35:26] <mooncup> it seems really strange that won't work
[03:35:27] <Koopz> that's what that js-file is for
[03:36:03] <Koopz> as the description says that thing makes SVGs "compatible" with jquery
[03:36:23] <mooncup> yeah but that is for actuallly manipulating the svg with jquery
[03:36:40] <Koopz> you might be able to $('.svg').click() when using it
[03:36:45] <mooncup> hm ok
[03:36:49] <Cork> no
[03:36:55] <mooncup> well it seems like overkill, but I guess it's worth a shot
[03:36:58] <Cork> clicks doesn't bubble between documents
[03:37:10] <mooncup> ah bollocks
[03:37:11] <Cork> and <svg> is a different doctype then html
[03:37:43] <Cork> there are plans on possibly changing that in svg 2.0
[03:38:11] <mooncup> http://jsfiddle.net/mdocxrdw/ that's what I'm trying to do
[03:38:27] <mooncup> I don't need to interact with the svg at all
[03:38:46] <mooncup> unforunately I can't put the svg in an image tag because that prevents its internal stuff from running
[03:38:50] <mooncup> tis really irritating
[03:39:09] <Cork> mooncup: that makes it even harder
[03:39:17] <Cork> as then you have the document as an external document
[03:39:41] <mooncup> this is far more effort than it's worth
[03:39:58] <mooncup> I just want clicking on a telephone to tick a radio
[03:40:02] <mooncup> :<
[03:40:16] <Cork> you MIGHT be able to do something like $('object').contents().find('*').on('click', ...)
[03:40:30] <effortDee> hey, i want to upgrade jquery to 1.9 , how do i go about this? Just swap the files out and add the new one?
[03:40:35] <Koopz> a telephone?
[03:40:49] <Cork> mooncup: but i don't know if you can access the document inside an <object> element
[03:41:03] <mooncup> hm ok
[03:41:04] <Cork> you might have to load the svg inline or in an iframe
[03:41:18] <Koopz> mooncup, have you considered using something like fontawesome or glyphicons?
[03:41:22] <Cork> alternatively you could put a div infront of it
[03:41:26] <Almis90> Hello guys I have this small function but it gets wrong width and height http://pastebin.com/3PCK6Zyi
[03:41:30] <Cork> mooncup: actually on second thought
[03:41:36] <Cork> why not just load the svg as a background image?
[03:41:39] <mooncup> Koopz: yeah we're using those, but I have an svg from the design team
[03:41:45] <mooncup> Cork: it has animations
[03:41:50] <Cork> so?
[03:42:07] <Cork> or do you mean on hover animations?
[03:42:09] <mooncup> would events still get triggered if it's a background image?
[03:42:11] <mooncup> tis on hover
[03:42:14] <Cork> ah
[03:42:23] <mooncup> that's why I switched it from being an image tag to an object
[03:42:25] <Cork> mooncup: best option might be to just inline it then
[03:42:50] <mooncup> ok thanks
[03:43:13] <mooncup> I shall have a play around and let you know how it goes
[03:43:32] <mooncup> can I do something like <svg src="">
[03:43:39] <Cork> no
[03:43:44] <Cork> you inline the svg
[03:43:52] <mooncup> oh I see
[03:43:55] <mooncup> fair enough
[03:43:57] <Cork> <svg><g><path/></g></svg>
[03:44:20] <mooncup> ooh I've just had a thought actually
[03:44:25] <Cork> it still needs the width and height and a few other of the attributes on the svg element
[03:44:39] <mooncup> if I inline the svg with a php include() then it won't be any different to using an src from my point of view
[03:47:15] <Almis90> I have this small function but it gets wrong width and height http://pastebin.com/3PCK6Zyi If I try to get the width and height after the click event then everything work as expected
[03:52:38] <Almis90> worked with timeout so I need callback for append any ideas?
[03:55:58] <mooncup> Cork: tis working with inline
[03:56:00] <mooncup> thanks very much
[03:56:05] <Cork> nice
[03:57:57] <SurajVerma> is anybody here now who can help me with the issue ?
[04:27:46] <Kartagis> do we have a getCurrentScroll() or similar?
[04:28:36] <Cork> Kartagis: you want to get the scrollposition?
[04:28:43] <Kartagis> Cork: yeah
[04:28:47] <Cork> on what element?
[04:28:58] <Kartagis> body
[04:29:11] <Cork> that depends on the browser
[04:29:19] <Cork> some browsers scroll body some scroll window
[04:29:29] <Kartagis> window then
[04:29:30] <Cork> on window it is scrollY
[04:29:43] <Cork> and on body and every other element it is scrollTop
[04:30:03] <Cork> and scrollY and scrollLeft
[04:30:10] <Cork> depending on direction
[04:31:05] <Kartagis> Cork: hrm. how come is http://magicleaves.com able to use .getCurrentScroll() then?
[04:31:27] <Cork> most likely cause they use a plugin to normalize the property name
[04:33:26] <Kartagis> hrm, they seem to have utilised http://code.createjs.com. maybe that's it
[04:35:00] <Cork> nope
[04:35:56] <Kartagis> they also seem to have jquery.once
[04:35:58] <Cork> function getCurrentScroll() { return window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop; }
[04:36:10] <Cork> line 412 inline in the page
[04:36:23] <Cork> Kartagis: once isn't anything special
[04:36:31] <Kartagis> yeah, that's it
[04:36:33] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com once
[04:36:35] <b-ot> Cork: .one() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/one/
[04:36:41] <Cork> oh wait ya
[04:36:42] <Kartagis> oh
[04:36:45] <Cork> once would be special
[04:36:46] <brollypop> hmmm if($('#field-2').attr('checked')) returns true even if my checkbox is unchecked
[04:36:51] <Kartagis> didn't see that one
[04:36:53] <Kartagis> gah
[04:37:02] <Cork> brollypop: never EVER use attr for state checking/changing
[04:37:09] <Cork> use prop
[04:37:25] <Cork> brollypop: attr will grab the attribute of the element
[04:37:31] <Cork> it isn't the active state of the element
[04:37:44] <Cork> but what the attribute was when it was parsed from html
[04:38:39] <Cork> brollypop: basically use prop, except for a very few cases when you actually want the raw attribute value
[04:38:49] <Cork> so prop until it gives you the wrong data
[04:39:20] <Cork> href on a link is one of the few examples
[04:39:27] <Kartagis> which one is more reliable? pageYOffset or scrollY?
[04:39:51] <Cork> pageYOffset is ie only
[04:40:12] <Cork> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff974684%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[04:41:09] <brollypop> hm Cork i have the same problem with .prop
[04:41:40] <Cork> brollypop: try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[04:44:05] <Paradisee> hello
[04:45:59] <Paradisee> how can i send json data to the server via ajax, with a simple button "save"..? i mean, each time i drag and drop an item inside the main div, i have to load it into a global variable or memory, and when i press on the save button, it has to send the data to the server in a single time..any suggestion?
[04:46:00] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1GAM7XT
[04:46:04] <Paradisee> here the code
[05:45:32] <rhymes> can anyone help me debug a problem with loading “pages” asynchronously and reattaching events? http://pastebin.com/dMa7uMaP
[05:46:36] <rhymes> what happens is that it seems to call the callback correctly but then the page flashes and looks like the javascript in the callback has never been run
[05:46:39] <rhymes> in the first place
[05:46:49] <rhymes> like jQuery is resetting something
[05:48:36] <amcsi_work> hi
[05:49:15] <amcsi_work> is there a lightweight MVVM framework for jQuery? or just some tools for makeshift 2-way data binding?
[05:51:48] <lilsammy> anyone used slicknav before? its not triggering my $('a').click function when all other links are
[05:52:15] <amcsi_work> so basically I need some sort of system that holds a tree of data, and I want to be able to bind to a certain part of the data tree and have the responsibility for manually doing notification
[05:52:33] <amcsi_work> providing the source of the notification
[05:54:26] <amcsi_work> the source of the notification is important (I think), because it is the source that never needs to be updates. e.g. if I have a text input field bound to some variable in the data tree, on the change event of that input field, I need to provide the info that says that the update came from the input field, so as not to update the input field via notification subscriptions unnecessarily
[05:55:21] <xec> amcsi_work: you could look at https://github.com/melanke/Watch.JS/
[05:58:40] <amcsi_work> xec, not good, WatchJS only works in IE9+. I don't need obvervation anyway; I'm fine to just notify manually
[05:59:32] <alami> hello, i have a problem with javascript http://pastie.org/9590670
[05:59:34] <alami> can any one tell me why i can't get it work?
[06:03:31] <alami> i think the source is not valid
[06:12:05] <alami> any one here?
[06:12:54] <alami> ok i get it, thanks
[06:48:58] <no_gravity> i have an element and want to loop through the rest of the dom after this element. how would you guys go about this?
[06:50:14] <Koopz> i'd loop through the whole dom and set a variable to true when said element has been reached
[06:50:49] <Koopz> but there might be better solutions
[06:51:22] <decx> what's the endgoal of that excercise?
[06:52:02] <decx> when is: var blah = $(el).length ? true : false; not enough?
[06:52:04] <Cork> no_gravity: you can't really loop through the rest of the dom
[06:52:15] <Cork> no_gravity: the rest of the siblings, sure
[06:52:25] <no_gravity> ok
[06:52:31] <Cork> but the rest of the dom would need quite a bit of traversing up the parent tree
[06:55:31] <FilipNortic> seems like one of our programmers uses sync ajax for validation... if I set timeout values do I get rid of most of the badthings before I have time to fix it for real?
[06:56:33] <Cork> FilipNortic: no, you can reduce the problem
[06:56:39] <Cork> but you can't fix them with timeouts
[06:57:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: the page will still frees until the timeout or response comes back
[07:28:48] <Absolute0> How do I fetch all the elements whose parent is not #notice?
[07:28:55] <Absolute0> $(':not(#notice) [disabled]') doesn't do it
[07:41:35] <decx> the premise of finding something based on what the parent is not is ridiculous anyway
[07:42:15] <Biwaa> decx: he left the irc anyway :D
[07:42:55] <decx> ah
[07:43:02] <decx> good old hide joins/parts
[07:45:59] <Biwaa> decx: same for me but when i tried to answer him, i cannot found his name with the tab proposition ;)
[07:47:25] <mooncup> does it not get confusing when people leave mid-conversation?
[07:48:21] <decx> the benefit of not having conversations disrupted by the constant j/p messages heavily outweighs that
[07:48:22] <Cork> mooncup: it is
[07:48:43] <DeVito> mornin everyone
[07:48:43] <Cork> decx: interesting
[07:48:48] <Cork> never had a problem with th
[07:48:51] <Cork> *that
[07:49:07] <Cork> the only time the quit/part/join is a problem is with netsplits
[07:49:18] <Cork> but there are limiting scripts to handle that
[07:49:36] <decx> i did both and prefer hidden jp
[07:49:40] <mooncup> irssi handles netsplits really well
[07:51:21] <Uhkis> +1 for ignored j/p/q
[07:52:19] <Cork> i don't think i could ever do that
[07:52:50] <Cork> it is way to common for ppl to ask question, wait for 5 sec and then quiting/parting
[07:53:00] <Biwaa> i hate come on irc and see a full page of j/p/q
[07:53:11] <Jattenalle> kids these days, dont appreciate a good netsplit wall of PART messages
[07:53:25] <Cork> :)
[07:53:31] <Cork> Jattenalle: mirc for the win!
[07:53:42] <Jattenalle> hydraIRC actually
[07:53:44] <Jattenalle> but close enough
[07:53:48] <Cork> who need updates, just frees for a minute :)
[07:54:00] <Biwaa> hexchat ! :D
[07:54:05] <Cork> Jattenalle: it was a joke
[07:54:14] <Uhkis> Cork: you find that out on tab completion ;-)
[07:54:15] <decx> i use mirc and i only have to wait 5 seconds to type an utf8 char
[07:54:19] <Cork> mirc is the worst client i know when it comes to handling netsplits
[07:54:19] <decx> future!
[07:54:33] <Jattenalle> oh, i've never used mirc, joke is lost on me :(
[07:54:34] <mooncup> mirc is pretty bad at handling flooding too
[07:54:48] <Cork> Uhkis: but not before you've spent 3 minutes+ building data for the answer
[07:55:00] <Cork> mooncup: ya, it is basically the same underlying problem
[07:55:19] <Cork> you could always tell if an op used mirc
[07:55:34] <Cork> cause then they couldn't bad the spammers :)
[07:56:07] <decx> my mirc scripts file is from 1999, i have detachment issues
[07:56:25] <Uhkis> lol
[07:56:42] <Cork> decx: i have a few from 97
[07:56:46] <Cork> possibly one from 96
[07:56:57] <mooncup> ManBearPixel: awesome nick
[07:57:02] <Cork> but ya, to this day i still miss mirc
[07:57:11] <mooncup> I don't think I ever really used mirc
[07:57:11] <ManBearPixel> mooncup: Thanks haha!
[07:57:16] <mooncup> it always annoyed me how bad it looked
[07:57:24] <decx> is there a modern client with similar scripting ?
[07:57:29] <Uhkis> switched from mirc to irssi around 10 years ago and never looked back
[07:57:33] <mooncup> what do you mean by similar?
[07:57:41] <mooncup> most clients let you script in actual languages
[07:57:49] <Cork> mooncup: it is customizable to a level no other client can get even close to
[07:58:04] <mooncup> I dunno about that
[07:58:05] <decx> one day i'll change
[07:58:07] <mooncup> any gui client maybe
[07:58:14] <mooncup> but irssi is pretty damned customisable
[07:58:21] <Cork> mooncup: including irssi
[07:58:32] <Cork> i've tried to reproduce a few features i had created in mirc scripts
[07:58:39] <mooncup> like what?
[07:58:46] <Cork> mooncup: irssi has the limitation of only having one window
[07:58:52] <Cork> my definition basically
[07:58:58] <mooncup> no it doesn't!
[07:59:00] <mooncup> well
[07:59:03] <mooncup> you can split windows anyway
[07:59:08] <mooncup> you can't layer them I guess
[07:59:12] <Cork> but it is only lines in the terminal
[07:59:15] <Cork> i meant windows
[07:59:38] <Cork> mooncup: the script i tried to reproduce was a summary window
[07:59:46] <mooncup> you can definately do that in irssi
[07:59:56] <mooncup> I have a window that is for my hilights and private messages
[07:59:59] <Cork> that would filter the data from all channels you where in and show a fake channel with just that data
[08:00:15] <mooncup> I'm sure you could do that in irssi
[08:00:20] <Cork> mooncup: the point is you would have to have the same terminal you have the rest in
[08:00:26] <decx> i have that too
[08:00:36] <Cork> you can't have a minimalistic window with just the needed part
[08:00:38] <mooncup> nah Cork you can split your irssi window into parts
[08:00:39] <decx> on *:TEXT:*decx*:#:{ if ($highlight($1-).color) { window @highlight | aline $ifmatch @highlight $chan - $timestamp < $+ $nick $+ > $1- } }
[08:00:50] <Cork> quassl has the support built in
[08:00:53] <mooncup> http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssisplit/
[08:00:56] <Cork> but it isn't customizalbe at all
[08:01:02] <Uhkis> can your mircs send push notification to your phone on hilight?!
[08:01:10] <Cork> decx: it was much more advanced then that
[08:01:18] <Cork> Uhkis: sure
[08:01:23] <Uhkis> darn :-)
[08:01:26] <Cork> Uhkis: mirc scripts has sockets
[08:01:30] <Cork> you can do anything from it
[08:01:43] <Cork> Uhkis: i should have a small irc server written in it somewhere
[08:01:54] <Cork> where client can actually connect to it
[08:02:15] <Cork> and an http server too :)
[08:02:34] <Cork> the irc server wasn't mine but the http one was
[08:02:50] <decx> forget nginx, mirc is the new black
[08:02:52] <Uhkis> that script/app was a horrible idea though, that notification spam drove me crazy
[08:02:59] <Cork> i plow down WAY to much time into mirc back then XD
[08:03:19] <Cork> Uhkis: you would do it by pushing the message to the google api
[08:03:22] <mooncup> I vaguely learned some mirc scripting at one point
[08:03:24] <decx> and all just to grab new scene releases from efnet
[08:03:26] <mooncup> never really got into it though
[08:03:27] <decx> ^^
[08:03:31] <mooncup> is it still actively developed?
[08:03:36] <Cork> ya
[08:03:58] <Cork> the developer moved the entire code base over to utf8 a little while ago
[08:04:16] <Cork> (before it was a translation hack internally it was still ascii)
[08:04:41] <Cork> that said, haven't used mirc actively in like 4-5 years
[08:04:55] <Cork> mostly cause it doens't have linux support
[08:05:01] <Cork> and hexchat is "good enough"
[08:05:20] <Cork> and what hexchat lacks i add with znc scripts
[08:05:46] <geppyz> @Crok you could run mIRC on Wine
[08:06:09] <Cork> geppyz: oh, i know i did for a while
[08:06:13] <geppyz> :)
[08:06:14] <Cork> but it bugs out quite badly
[08:06:58] <Cork> or rather it did last i used it
[08:07:18] <Jabberwock> In case no one is aware, DO NOT VISIT JQUERY.COM
[08:07:18] <Jabberwock> http://www.riskiq.com/resources/blog/jquerycom-malware-attack-puts-privileged-enterprise-it-accounts-risk#.VCLSfYfQyko
[08:07:58] <Jabberwock> It's dropping malware on visitor's machines.
[08:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> Jabberwock: Please don't spread FUD
[08:08:50] <Jabberwock> I'm not.
[08:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> RiskIQ is the *only* source that has detected this.
[08:09:07] <Jabberwock> STFU and listen or be an asshole and don't. That's your choice. I served the warning.
[08:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> And it wasn't reproducible.
[08:09:13] <s5fs> Jabberwock: I'm an admin for jQuery, the site is save.
[08:09:14] <Jabberwock> It is here.
[08:09:25] <Jabberwock> s5fs: No one has responded to us.
[08:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> And if we were compromised, which is possible, it was fixed nearly instantly.
[08:09:36] <arschmitz> Jabberwock: Also they clearly say it was only for 30 minutes several days ago
[08:09:51] <ManBearPixel> Haha
[08:09:57] <s5fs> Jabberwock: I'm just waking up, another server was DDoS'd again. I thought we sent out a press release.
[08:10:27] <DeVito> is there a way to detect of all elements with the same class name are visable / invisable?
[08:10:51] <Cork> DeVito: depends on what you mean by visible
[08:11:01] <decx> $('.class').filter(':visible')
[08:11:05] <decx> something like that
[08:11:07] <Cork> decx: depends
[08:11:19] <Cork> visible might be "rendered on the screen"
[08:11:29] <Cork> and then it is much more complicated
[08:11:42] <decx> i thought :visible cares about all that
[08:11:48] <Cork> it doesn't
[08:12:09] <Cork> :visible !== display: none || visibility: hidden
[08:12:15] <DeVito> Im making a show / hide all toggle
[08:12:17] <decx> you mean like an absolutely positioned element that is out of bounds
[08:12:23] <DeVito> and there are a lot of elements with the same class name
[08:12:24] <Cork> possibly visibitily: collapse, not sure there
[08:12:41] <Cork> ok
[08:12:48] <Cork> DeVito: then what decx wrote
[08:13:00] <Cork> $('.class').filter(':visible').not(this)
[08:13:11] <decx> occams razored :D
[08:13:39] <DeVito> hah
[08:13:43] <DeVito> ill give it a go
[08:13:50] <Cork> actually
[08:13:54] <Cork> you can optimize that
[08:14:00] <Cork> $('.class:visible').not(this)
[08:14:03] <Cork> :)
[08:17:48] <mandark_> hey guys..
[08:17:55] <mandark_> jQuery problem
[08:18:04] <mandark_> anyone able to help?
[08:18:06] <mandark_> http://jsfiddle.net/gx1sa3ym/#fork
[08:18:33] <mandark_> is there any way on creating a variable locally scoped for an on function?
[08:18:59] <mandark_> which could be using in both the mouseenter & mouse exit?
[08:19:32] <decx> data()
[08:21:02] <mandark_> how would i use that with the on function?
[08:21:19] <Cork> mandark_: you have the data in the wrong order in the on call
[08:21:30] <Cork> mandark_: data should be after the event type
[08:21:42] <decx> oh so you can use additional data in the on call without data()?
[08:21:53] <Cork> yes
[08:23:49] <mandark_> Cork: could you please update the fork and show me an example of where the data is suppose to go
[08:24:01] <Cork> sure
[08:25:49] <mandark_> thanks
[08:26:23] <Cork> mandark_: http://jsfiddle.net/gx1sa3ym/1/
[08:27:19] <mandark_> Cork: much appreciated ;)
[08:33:03] <decx> interesting !
[08:37:24] <jiffe> how can I go about making sure that an input field confirms to a certain regex while they're typing?  with onkeypress I can get the key and the input value but that doesn't tell me if they're typing the key somewhere in the middle or if they have a selection
[08:38:02] <NoiseEee> jiffe: mostly that behaviour is really annoying.
[08:38:09] <NoiseEee> jiffe: scrub it on blur
[08:38:19] <NoiseEee> jiffe: or, google some input filter plugins
[08:38:44] <Getty> Someone here using shapeshift? or has any idea where the community of it is? ;) damn github only projects...
[08:38:44] <Cork> jiffe: use the input event
[08:38:57] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[08:38:58] <b-ot> Cork: input - Event reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[08:40:58] <Cork> jiffe: http://jsfiddle.net/cmtnqs6y/
[08:56:39] <synapt> Any of you guys ever make use of the FriendURL plugin?
[08:57:37] <starlord> Does jQuery have a function to enable/disable <button>s?
[08:58:03] <robertmaxrees> starlord you use .prop('disabled', true) and .prop('disabled', false)
[08:58:04] <starlord> Currently I'm doing button.disabled = <bool>
[08:58:09] <starlord> Okay cool, thanks.
[08:58:17] <robertmaxrees> that's basically the same thing btw.
[08:58:24] <mandark_> Cork: with relation to the on listener, when parsing in variable.. is it possible to reference the selector?
[08:58:25] <robertmaxrees> my version maps to yours :)
[08:58:28] <starlord> And that'll return the jQuery object for chaining?
[08:58:29] <mandark_> http://jsfiddle.net/gx1sa3ym/2/
[08:58:35] <robertmaxrees> starlord yep
[08:58:38] <starlord> <3
[08:58:54] <Cork> mandark_: not sure what you mean
[08:59:17] <Cork> ah
[08:59:21] <starlord> wow, 81 lines for clojurescript, 73 for javascript
[08:59:25] <starlord> this is nic.
[08:59:26] <starlord> nice.
[08:59:30] <Cork> mandark_: no it isn't cause you don't have the targeted element yet there
[08:59:49] <Cork> mandark_: the target element only exists inside the callback
[08:59:57] <Cork> this runs when you bind the event handlers
[09:00:13] <mandark_> Cork: i thought as much.. thanks
[09:02:32] <d0de> I load some audio with $('#audio-element').attr( 'src', '/audio/my-file.mp4') - but how can I trigger someone to happen once the audio has finished loading?
[09:03:09] <Cork> d0de: the canplaythrough event
[09:03:10] <robertmaxrees> bind to the load event of that element - $('#audio-element').on('load', function) {}); probably.
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> oh or that haha
[09:03:19] <robertmaxrees> also, use prop and not attr :)
[09:03:23] <Cork> ?g mdn canplaythrough
[09:03:34] <decx> do these audio api events have jquery variants?
[09:03:36] <Cork> <_<
[09:03:47] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn canplaythrough]
[09:03:47] <Cork> decx: it isn't jquery variants
[09:03:55] <robertmaxrees> looks like the bot's dead?
[09:04:03] <Cork> b-ot: ping
[09:04:07] <Cork> yup
[09:04:12] <decx> oh so .on will catch the natives
[09:04:27] <Cork> decx: only the shortcuts is jquery specifics
[09:04:38] <Cork> like .click binding to .on('click'
[09:05:11] <d0de> thank you all. Perhaps canplaythrough is the easiest solution, I will test it
[09:05:32] <Cork> d0de: not easier, it will trigger earlier though
[09:05:38] <jiffe> Cork: the one thing I don't like about that is if you go into the middle of the input string and delete a character it puts your cursor at the end again
[09:05:57] <Cork> when the browser thinks enough is downloaded to be able to play to the end without stopping for buffering
[09:06:15] <Cork> jiffe: ah, true
[09:06:27] <Cork> jiffe: you can store the cursor position though
[09:06:29] <d0de> that is the more desirable behavior in my case
[09:06:32] <Cork> an restore it after the replace
[09:06:44] <decx> oh only the event object differs then?
[09:06:55] <d0de> Thanks everyone. For some reason I had it in my head that I was going to have to use promises, and I was dreading it as I've never been able to implement them properly
[09:06:58] <Cork> decx: they wrap the event object
[09:07:03] <Cork> to make it cross browser
[09:07:06] <decx> ok
[09:13:07] <jhawins> Hey all
[09:13:29] <d0de> does anyone know which element will fire the 'loaded' or 'canplaythrough' event? is it the <audio> element or the <source> element?
[09:13:58] <jhawins> Has jQuery.com been compromised? http://i.imgur.com/xNqbgv0.png
[09:14:03] <Cork> d0de: the audio
[09:14:08] <jhawins> This was up for a fraction of a second, literally.
[09:14:13] <jhawins> And now the page is normal.
[09:14:24] <ryanneufeld> jhawins: we are actively solving this problem
[09:14:34] <d0de> Cork, thanks. I'm having trouble capturing it, I'll try some more
[09:14:47] <d0de> it should fire even if the files are local on disk, right?
[09:14:56] <Cork> d0de: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/canplaythrough
[09:15:07] <Cork> d0de: sure
[09:15:21] <Cork> d0de: try with prop instead of attr
[09:15:32] <jhawins> ryanneufeld: interesting. I'm kind of curious but if it's a secret so be it :P
[09:16:01] <robertmaxrees> d0de as long as you're loading it via http and not directly from your drive, you should be fine.
[09:16:04] <ryanneufeld> jhawins: someone is writing a blog post
[09:16:38] <d0de> Cork, after changing the src with prop, what's the correct way to then get the audio element to load the new src? I'm using .detach().appendTo() to get the browser to recognize the new src, is this dumb?
[09:17:09] <jhawins> ryanneufeld: cool. We all happened to see it in the JavaScript chat room on StackOverflow so I figured I would ask. Have a good one!
[09:17:36] <d0de> robertmaxrees, excuse me being ignorant, but how do I know if I'm loading via http or not? I confess I had never considered the distinction for local files before
[09:17:59] <robertmaxrees> d0de you're not referencing it via file:// right?
[09:18:29] <d0de> no, just via 'myfolder/file.mp4'
[09:18:49] <decx> do you just open your html or do you have a local server
[09:19:11] <d0de> decx, no local server
[09:19:19] <decx> then it's not file:
[09:19:55] <d0de> for reasons I do not fully understand, it seems to be working now :)
[09:20:13] <decx> gremlins
[09:20:47] <Cork> d0de: you can set src on the audio element
[09:21:19] <Cork> d0de: if you need to have <source> elements you might be better of to replace the entire audio element
[09:21:57] <d0de> Cork, thank you, will consider
[09:22:16] <d0de> Must run. Thanks very much everyone!
[09:42:56] <jesselang> I'm having problems using $(...).load('page.html #element-id') to bring in a collapsible element. It won't enhance, even after using .trigger('create') or .collapsible('refresh'). Does any one have ideas to help me out?
[09:43:40] <Cork> jesselang: make sure you don't get duplicate elements with the same id after the .load
[09:45:37] <jesselang> I seem to only have one.
[09:45:56] <jesselang> I am actually pulling a class selector from page.html instead of an ID.
[09:46:05] <Cork> $('[id="id-you-want-to-check"]').length
[09:46:10] <Cork> will tell you
[09:46:24] <Cork> note you can't use $('#id')
[09:46:46] <jesselang> $('.agent-general-qa').length gives me 1.
[09:46:59] <Cork> thats a class
[09:47:01] <Cork> not an id
[09:47:14] <Cork> and ya, classes doesn't have the limitation
[09:47:14] <Robdgreat> 11:45 [ jesselang] I am actually pulling a class selector from page.html instead of an ID.
[09:47:41] <jesselang> I know. I pull in a classed element, because I want to load the element into multiple elements in my page.
[09:47:57] <jesselang> Without element ID conflicts.
[09:48:21] <decx> maybe dont rely on the flimsy fragment support of .load() and use .ajax()
[09:48:28] <jesselang> The element loads fine, but I can't seem to get it to redraw.
[09:48:53] <Cork> well .load is fine
[09:48:56] <jesselang> It pulls in the right fragment. I've tried it as an ID and a class.
[09:48:59] <Cork> but don't send the full page from the server
[09:49:27] <jesselang> I just can't get it to enhance once it's loaded.
[09:49:29] <Cork> jesselang: the context isn't fully obvious
[09:49:42] <Cork> but it sounds like a plugin is modifying the html on load
[09:49:46] <Cork> and it doesn't know of the new html
[09:49:52] <Cork> and that is why things fails for you
[09:50:36] <jesselang> I've tried doing this on document.ready() and the pageinit event. Where can I load content before the enhancing is done?
[09:51:03] <Cork> jesselang: pageinit makes me suspect your using jquery mobile
[09:51:04] <robertmaxrees> what kind of "enhancing" is it?
[09:51:15] <jesselang> Cork: correct.
[09:51:37] <Cork> so you have problem with getting jqm to update the added html
[09:51:54] * Cork leaves it to someone that like fiddling with jqm
[09:51:56] <jesselang> Yes. A jqm collapsible.
[09:52:01] <decx> i thought jqm has its own methods for loading content
[09:52:23] <jesselang> decx, seemingly whole pages, but not fragments.
[09:52:33] <decx> add 15 random attributes to the html, success /s
[09:52:52] <jesselang> If you want to change pages, which I don't. I want to inject content into existing pages.
[09:53:44] <jesselang> Is this room the place to get jqm help, or is there another more suitable one?
[09:53:46] <decx> i still havent done anything with jqm, but if we repeat jqm enough a certain lead dev might show up
[09:53:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:54:31] <decx> no this is the one according to the topic jesselang
[09:54:34] <robertmaxrees> jesselang this is for all jquery projects.  most of us here don't really know much about JQM sadly.  somebody might show up who does know though.
[09:54:45] <Cork> jesselang: it is the correct channel
[09:55:10] <s5fs> jesselang: I've summoned a maintainer, with luck they will appear ;)
[09:55:21] <arschmitz> decx:  ha ha ha
[09:55:30] <decx> ^^ arschmitz
[09:55:37] <jesselang> I've found some resources that suggest using .trigger('create') and .collapsible('refresh'), but those examples all use .append() instead of .load().
[09:55:58] <arschmitz> decx: my name works better then jqm :)
[09:55:59] <jesselang> s5fs, thank you. I really appreciate everyone's help.
[09:56:25] <arschmitz> jesselang: ill read back just give me a minute
[09:56:37] <jesselang> arschmitz, cool. Thank you.
[09:57:23] <arschmitz> jesselang: just use .enhanceWithin();
[09:57:35] <arschmitz> on the parent of whatever your trying to enhance
[09:58:21] <arschmitz> jesselang: trigger( "create" ); is deprecated
[09:58:42] <jesselang> $('.general-qa').load('agent.html .agent-general-qa').enhanceWithin()
[09:58:51] <jesselang> This did not work.
[09:59:13] <arschmitz> jesselang: .agent-general-qa the the thing your trying to enhance?
[09:59:27] <arschmitz> jesselang: or is it the parent?
[09:59:39] <arschmitz> you need to call it on the parent
[09:59:53] <jesselang> OK, let me try that.
[10:00:06] <arschmitz> it enhances everything within the element
[10:01:07] <jesselang> $('.general-qa').load('agent.html .agent-general-qa') returns .general-qa. I want to enhance what I've loaded into it.
[10:02:04] <arschmitz> jesselang: right thats how jquery works you will need to do a seperate call to what you injected
[10:02:46] <arschmitz> jesselang: can you make a simple test case?
[10:03:11] <jesselang> Yes. At this point, I suppose that is what is necessary.
[10:03:59] <arschmitz> jesselang: oh i see your issue lol
[10:04:12] <arschmitz> jesselang: your doing load thats async
[10:04:20] <arschmitz> your calling enhanceWithin before its ever loaded
[10:04:45] <jesselang> arschmitz, yes, that's one of the fun nuances of Ajax.
[10:04:51] <arschmitz> jesselang: right
[10:04:56] <arschmitz> but your not taking that into account
[10:05:12] <jesselang> OK. So I'll add a the success callback and enhanceWithin() there.
[10:05:22] <arschmitz> jesselang: yes
[10:05:29] <decx> does load() have done() ?
[10:06:09] <arschmitz> deck i dont think so it does not return a defered
[10:06:16] <arschmitz> it returns a jquery object
[10:06:32] <jesselang> Bingo. Thank you.
[10:06:55] <jesselang> That's going to make my life quite a bit less exciting this week.
[10:06:56] <arschmitz> jesselang: no problem dont use .load with jqm much mad me actually think :)
[10:07:08] <arschmitz> mad/made
[10:08:02] <jesselang> arschmitz, your help is very much appreciated. jq and jqm certainly do help Javascript suck a little less.
[10:08:23] <jesselang> No offense to anyone who loves the stuff.
[10:08:44] <robertmaxrees> offense taken >:(
[10:08:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, it's all good.
[10:09:09] <Prometheian> Is there a way for me to do $('').width(this.width) and have it get the selected element without using .each?
[10:10:13] <Cork> Prometheian: no
[10:10:33] <Prometheian> kk ty
[10:10:35] <robertmaxrees> sure - pass a function to width instead and return what you want.
[10:11:24] <robertmaxrees> .width(function() { return this.width });
[10:12:00] <Cork> except width isn't a property on this
[10:12:40] <starlord> Is there a shorter way to pass val() to map() than this?   $('.filename').map(function() { return $(this).val() })
[10:12:52] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm confused about the question, then.  Prometheian can you clarify what you're trying to dio?
[10:12:55] <robertmaxrees> *do
[10:13:08] <Cork> starlord: that will wrap the result in jquery though
[10:13:24] <starlord> Yes that's what I want.
[10:13:32] <starlord> Is there a shorter way to write that line?
[10:13:42] <Cork> you want the values from the fields wrapped in jquery??
[10:13:50] <starlord> Yes.
[10:13:54] <Cork> why?
[10:14:00] <Cork> its strings
[10:14:04] <Cork> not dom elements
[10:14:12] <starlord> So I can do $.contains
[10:14:19] <Cork> you can't on strings
[10:14:30] <Prometheian> I'm working on things and they have to work in IE7/8. I can fix some of the issues by setting current width to current width for some elements. Bloody weird.
[10:14:38] <starlord> Hmm.
[10:15:01] <Prometheian> So I wanted to know if I could get a 'this' because jQuery loops though matching elements anyway.
[10:15:01] <Cork> starlord: jquery is meant to be used for dom elements, it does't have much for other forms of controls
[10:15:09] <starlord> Well I have an array of strings stored in the val() of several <option> elements, and I want to check if a given string is among them.
[10:15:22] <Cork> starlord: so what you want is most likely $.map($('.filename'), function() { return $(this).val(); }).indexOf(searh_value);
[10:15:24] <starlord> (Each <option> has one val)
[10:15:29] <starlord> Okay, sounds good.
[10:15:45] <starlord> Is that really the shortest way to get each val() from each .filename?
[10:15:58] <Cork> starlord: if you want a clean array; yes
[10:15:59] <starlord> I can't pass, say, $.val as a function, instead?
[10:16:05] <Cork> no
[10:16:07] <starlord> :'(
[10:16:20] <starlord> Maybe $.prototype.val ?
[10:16:31] <Cork> caues map gives you a dom element, not a jqeury object
[10:16:40] <starlord> No I mean to $.map
[10:16:49] <Cork> that is what i meant
[10:16:55] <starlord> $.map($('.filename), $.prototype.val)
[10:17:14] <Cork> will have a dom element as this, not a jqeury object
[10:17:19] <Cork> so it will most likely crash
[10:18:13] <starlord> Dang, undefined is not a function
[10:18:49] <Cork> starlord: $.map($('.filename), function() { return $.fn.val.call(this); })
[10:18:51] <Paradisee> why am i not able to show properly a var into a json? http://dpaste.com/1X3E2P2
[10:18:51] <Cork> if you prefer that
[10:18:54] <Cork> opps
[10:19:00] <Cork> starlord: $.map($('.filename), function() { return $.fn.val.call($(this)); })
[10:19:09] <Cork> but the problem is you need to wrap this in $()
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee what do you mean?
[10:19:14] <Cork> so your code won't work
[10:19:15] <starlord> I'm just trying to avoid writing an anon fn.
[10:19:28] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: {'id': {'clone_id': {'state': 0}}}
[10:19:29] <starlord> That's my main goal here.
[10:19:33] <Cork> you could write a wrapper function and attach it to $.fn
[10:19:35] <Paradisee> that's what it prints
[10:19:42] <Paradisee> insted of the real var
[10:19:44] <starlord> That's worse ;)
[10:19:48] <Cork> $.fn.allVal = function() {};
[10:19:59] <robertmaxrees> "instead of the real var" ? huh? could you cook up a better example?
[10:20:04] <Cork> then you have to write the full code
[10:20:21] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: if you look to my code, there's a var called id
[10:20:31] <Paradisee> it should show var id = ui.draggable.attr('id')
[10:20:43] <Paradisee> but it shows 'id' instead
[10:20:49] <packofbadgers> So.. about this inability to confirm servers having been compromised. I was just served a plaintext page after using the search feature and it was a note from the dude that did it
[10:21:03] <packofbadgers> Sorry for getting everyone off track here. Who/where should I report this?
[10:21:18] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee still not following.  how are you getting this?  could you create a fiddle?
[10:21:27] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/1QQS6H0
[10:21:40] <starlord> Hmm, this actually fails on toLowerCase... $.map($('.taken-filename'), function() { return $(this).val(); })
[10:21:45] <robertmaxrees> s5fs can you address packofbadgers?
[10:22:06] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i cant make a fiddle, cus i show the output on the server, so you can't see it
[10:22:39] <starlord> Oohh, Cork you can't use this in the fn, it's not bound.
[10:22:41] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee that's fine... but your problem makes no sense.  on one like you're setting that var.  on another line, you're creating an object.
[10:22:48] <starlord> Cork: el needs to be passed as first arg to fn
[10:22:49] <gnarf> packofbadgers: we are aware of it (this time)
[10:22:50] <robertmaxrees> they have nothing to do with one another.
[10:22:57] <robertmaxrees> gnarf++
[10:23:04] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: so?
[10:23:06] <s5fs> packofbadgers: I'm on the jQuery infrastructure team, we are actively working to resolve the issue.
[10:23:22] <s5fs> (as is gnarf)
[10:23:27] <gnarf> packofbadgers: though can you define "just"
[10:23:33] <packofbadgers> Awesome. I just saw the blog post and wanted to share
[10:23:41] <packofbadgers> “just”?
[10:23:52] <packofbadgers> Oh.. maybe 15 minutes ago
[10:23:54] <s5fs> packofbadgers: how long ago did you see the message
[10:23:55] <gnarf> yeah
[10:24:04] <gnarf> if it had been minutes ago i would be more alarmed
[10:24:07] <gnarf> we are on it
[10:24:11] <s5fs> Ah okay, yeah. They've been defacing us as we work haha!
[10:24:12] <gnarf> building up a new server, etc
[10:24:30] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you're not making any sense.  are you expecting var id = ui.draggable.attr('id') and json_data to someboyd be related
[10:24:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:24:33] <packofbadgers> Excellent. He said it was iframe injection, posted his public PGP (I closed the window without a screen shot, sorry). He wants a job apparently
[10:24:38] <robertmaxrees> *somehow
[10:24:54] <starlord> Should functions passed to .on be given an 'event' param, or no param and just use the global 'event'?
[10:24:54] <s5fs> packofbadgers: yup, we saw that too, I snagged it in a gist
[10:25:09] <robertmaxrees> starlord depends if you need the event object or not.
[10:25:17] <s5fs> packofbadgers: I won't be hiring them but I doubt we are the type of employer they are looking for.
[10:25:23] <starlord> :'(
[10:25:40] <s5fs> Although totally unrelated, I am looking for a front-end dev with cordova experience for a 3 mo contract!
[10:26:37] <packofbadgers> Thanks s5fs and gnarf. First time on IRC and I can guarantee I’ll be back
[10:29:37] <Paradisee> so? any help?
[10:29:54] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee what relation do you expect those two things to have?
[10:30:01] <robertmaxrees> because i feel like I'm missing a step here.
[10:30:18] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i just need to put a variable inside that json
[10:30:25] <Paradisee> {var}
[10:30:37] <Paradisee> where var is something like: var id = ui.draggable.attr('id');
[10:30:58] <Mokstar> packofbadgers, what'd you search for?
[10:30:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want that key to be the value of that var?
[10:31:01] <Paradisee> it doesn't show the content of id
[10:31:06] <Paradisee> but 'id'
[10:31:11] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: yes
[10:31:23] <robertmaxrees> because that means you want json_data[id] = {}
[10:31:33] <robertmaxrees> need to use a slightly different syntax for that.
[10:31:53] <Paradisee> i don't get it
[10:32:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/7aea23h9/
[10:33:15] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee this should give you the basic idea.
[10:33:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't dynamically create property names with the syntax you were using before
[10:34:44] <Paradisee> {'light': {'id': {'state': 0}}}
[10:34:47] <Paradisee> it works...
[10:34:55] <Paradisee> but how to do that with the others var
[10:35:19] <robertmaxrees> which other var?
[10:35:42] <Paradisee> id, clone_id
[10:36:10] <robertmaxrees> if you want the id property name to be dynamic, you have to use what I showed you before.  same with clone_id
[10:36:55] <Paradisee> so i have to create the same object with all the vars i need?
[10:37:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7aea23h9/1/ for more example
[10:38:00] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[10:42:03] <s5fs> packofbadgers: welcome! irc is where it's at
[10:42:19] <robertmaxrees> hella
[10:42:27] <s5fs> hecka haha
[10:42:41] <robertmaxrees> hella norcal for days
[10:43:38] <s5fs> hella <3 oakland
[10:44:26] <packofbadgers> I searched for forEach (I was looking for .Each)
[11:00:41] <edrahn> how do I remove a tag from a object, so that it only removes that tag and not anything in it?
[11:09:12] <systemfault> edrahn: The question doesn't make sense, do you mind giving us more information?
[11:09:53] <edrahn> I have <div><h4>Text</h4></div>. I want to just remove the h4
[11:09:56] <edrahn> but keep Text
[11:10:51] <edrahn> nm. I just figred it out .contents().unwrap()
[11:32:21] <mvpgraff> Did anybody else have issues with using spinner currency not showing up?
[11:36:33] <elmcrest> Hi everybody. I hope you guys can give me help on this, too. I want to call typeahead() with an options Variable ... like $(.'selectMe').typeahead(optionsVar); ... but I don't know how to format the variable. In the case I got that thing running I had two Objects within the brackets from typeahead() ...
[11:37:01] <elmcrest> so something like typeahead({},{})
[11:38:43] <robertmaxrees> typeAhead expects two objects, not one, so you've have to pass two objects.
[11:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and the format is going to be the same as if you did it inline.
[11:39:55] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees works, thx a lot :)
[11:41:18] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees sometimes I just see nothing :/
[11:42:06] <elmcrest> though I have to say to my defense that I'm new to JS ... but I guess this doesn't really count on this :) ... anyway thx again robertmaxrees
[11:42:35] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest http://fixee.org/paste/guqc6ol/#url=3a8ll9y
[11:44:02] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees ah I see... that looks quite unusual to me but thx, it's shorter than my version with "var" two times..
[11:44:22] <unnu> I hate Jquery so much right now
[11:44:26] <unnu> i could scream
[11:44:39] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest you just have to create two objects and pass those instead.
[11:44:40] <unnu> (its awesome, i am a dumbass, and can not figure it out)
[11:44:46] <robertmaxrees> unnu what's going on?
[11:44:55] <unnu> dropdowns
[11:45:00] <decx> what are you going to you scream? imma use mootools!
[11:45:05] <decx> -you
[11:45:16] <unnu> had it kinda working last night
[11:45:50] <Paradisee> how can i check if a key already exists in a json?
[11:45:56] <Paradisee> json_data[id] = {}
[11:46:05] <Paradisee> to make sure, to do not create this again
[11:46:22] <Cork> Paradisee: do you mean json or an object
[11:46:30] <Paradisee> Cork: an object
[11:46:33] <robertmaxrees> they mean an object property.
[11:46:39] <Cork> flat of nested?
[11:46:47] <robertmaxrees> nested object properties
[11:46:48] <Paradisee> nested
[11:47:09] <Cork> then you would have to loop the object tree one way or another
[11:47:13] <unnu> select country, if country = US then show state, if country = CA then show the same select but change label to provence, if they choose a state, grab xml file to get the countys in that state and pop a select with it
[11:47:22] <Cork> the cleanest solution is prob to use a recursive function to search for it
[11:47:24] <unnu> simple stuff really, but obviously i am stupid
[11:47:43] <unnu> and i should just quit programming after 40+ consecutive hours awake
[11:48:17] <unnu> actually that is a lie, i dozed off for about two hours six hours ago . . . .
[11:48:29] <Cork> unnu: have two labels and just switch between then based on the value
[11:48:48] <Cork> and then have a wrapper around it all to show and hide it if it isn't us or ca
[11:49:34] <Paradisee> Cork: something like: for key in obj.keys(): if key == 'salcazzo':
[11:49:48] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can just do if (!myObject[prop]) {}
[11:49:49] <Paradisee> python \o/
[11:50:10] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ill give a try, hope it works..im gonna hate js so bad
[11:50:36] <robertmaxrees> js isn't that bad.  just has some stuff to be aware of.
[11:51:03] <Cork> Paradisee: no first you have to check if the key exist in the object
[11:51:22] <Cork> Paradisee: if it doesn't then you have to loop all the values and check if any of them are an object
[11:51:30] <Paradisee> Cork: then i just need to loop the object and search for the right value
[11:51:32] <Cork> and then call your self with the nested obejct
[11:51:57] <robertmaxrees> or just test if the given property exists... unless there's a need to go more than one level at a time.
[11:52:25] <robertmaxrees> like if you want to be able to do myThing[prop1][aChild] with great abandon
[11:52:26] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: what about what you just wrote?
[11:52:28] <Cork> oh, i though it was defined it needs to support nested
[11:52:35] <Paradisee> i mean if (!myObject[prop]) {}
[11:52:52] <Cork> i would prob write that as if(prop in object) {}
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> undefined is a falsy value.  if that doesn't exist, you'll get "false".
[11:53:17] <Cork> the other will fail if the value is "false"
[11:54:01] <unnu> Cork, my problem is it ALWAYS thinks i select something in the US
[11:54:06] <Cork> var obj = { k: false }; if(!obj['k']) { }
[11:54:21] <robertmaxrees> Cork good point.
[11:54:34] <Paradisee> let's give a try
[11:54:38] <Cork> var obj = { k: false }; if('k' in obj) { }
[11:54:52] <Cork> it reads kinda well too
[11:54:54] <robertmaxrees> or test typeof obj['k']
[11:55:41] <Cork> ya but then you have to go if(typeof obj['k'] === undefined)
[11:55:46] <Cork> kinda long
[11:56:22] <Cork> unnu: if(val == 'US' || val ==
[11:56:25] <Cork> opps
[11:56:28] <Paradisee> seems to work with: http://dpaste.com/3BN6VMF
[11:56:32] <Cork> unnu: if(val == 'US' || val == 'CA') {} else {}
[11:56:37] <Cork> what's so hard about that?
[11:56:43] <unnu> :( okay
[11:56:50] <Paradisee> thanks robertmaxrees and Cork
[11:56:55] <unnu> its reading from my xml file
[11:57:07] <unnu> so
[11:57:08] <unnu> idk
[11:57:15] <unnu> i will recode it from scratch
[11:57:21] <unnu> that should fix it
[11:57:21] <Cork> unnu: or even $('.wrapper').toggleClasS('hide-this-class', val == 'US' || val == 'CA')
[11:57:58] <Cork> bah
[11:58:02] <Cork> *toggleClass
[11:58:28] <Cork> though you prob want to disable/enable the field when your at it
[11:59:10] <Cork> unnu: or even $('.wrapper').toggleClasS('hide-this-class', val == 'US' || val == 'CA').find('select').prop('disabled', val == 'US' || val == 'CA')
[11:59:24] <Cork> though.. i just realize you want the complete oposite of that :)
[11:59:43] <robertmaxrees> use === btw :)
[12:00:04] <Cork> doesn't really matter much in this case
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> still a good idea to get in the habit.
[12:00:27] <Cork> unnu: or even $('.wrapper').toggleClass('hide-this-class', val !== 'US' && val !== 'CA').find('select').prop('disabled', val !== 'US' && val !== 'CA')
[12:00:28] <Cork> there
[12:00:34] <unnu> okay
[12:00:37] <unnu> thanks
[12:00:39] <unnu> sorry i am so pissy
[12:00:45] <unnu> clients are being stupid today
[12:00:55] <unnu> and i haven't had enought sleep to deal with JS
[12:01:08] * unnu is a security + PHP guy . . . 
[12:01:13] <Cork> i don't understand why ppl hate js so much
[12:01:34] <Cork> as long as you stay away from old crappy features it is a clean and nice language
[12:01:39] <Cork> (except for dates)
[12:01:49] <robertmaxrees> because it's got some big differences from other languages that can seem pretty confusing.
[12:01:49] <Cork> kinda the same with php
[12:01:57] <robertmaxrees> event-driven, prototypes, etc.
[12:01:59] <Cork> true
[12:02:11] <Cork> funny enough ppl seam to love go
[12:02:16] <Cork> and it is quite close
[12:02:59] <robertmaxrees> there's also the DOM APIs, which is the real wart IMO.
[12:03:12] <Cork> ya
[12:03:21] <Cork> the dom api needs a BIG overhaul
[12:03:32] <Cork> much of it sucks badly
[12:03:42] <Cork> but that isn't really js though
[12:04:08] <robertmaxrees> right, but people aren't generally aware/equate the two in their head.
[12:04:11] <Cork> that might be where ppl get it wrong
[12:04:19] <Cork> they hate the dom, and thing "its part of js"
[12:04:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:05:07] <Cork> btw have you seen what they plan for future dom apis?
[12:05:39] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:05:57] <Cork> Promise is making a bit inpact on future dom apis
[12:06:03] <Cork> bit==big
[12:06:09] <robertmaxrees> not surprising
[12:06:24] <Cork> and they are making a replacement for xhr that is promise based (called fetch)
[12:06:44] <robertmaxrees> neat
[12:06:54] <robertmaxrees> i'll be glad when I get to use it in 10 years haha
[12:07:00] <Cork> lol
[12:07:09] <Cork> things is moving along a lot faster lately
[12:07:46] <Cork> i think when the old browsers is getting faced out we won't have 10 year+ turnarounds anymore
[12:07:59] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.
[12:08:00] <Cork> mainly ie9
[12:08:06] <robertmaxrees> and 8 ;)
[12:08:16] <Cork> well i meant ie < 10 :)
[12:08:18] <robertmaxrees> my company makes a lot of money off IE8 still, so we support it.
[12:10:18] <Cork> must admit what excites me the most is es6 and new css goodies
[12:11:13] <Cork> fat arrow callback will be sweet for example
[12:12:18] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3y2r2hom/ <--- what am I doing wrong here? ignore the HTML part, I am trying to replicate the same thing with js
[12:12:46] <Cork> Kartagis: why not just do it with jquery?
[12:12:58] <Cork> instead of raw dom calls
[12:13:17] <Kartagis> Cork: hrm, I didn't even know I could
[12:13:30] <Cork> Kartagis: and to answer the question, you create one tr and one td
[12:13:40] <decx> to make adding to the dom in a loop more performant ofcourse ;)
[12:13:40] <Cork> and then you move them around in the dom in a loop
[12:13:41] <Kartagis> in a for loop
[12:13:51] <Cork> you will only end up with one of each at the end
[12:14:26] <Kartagis> what's the correct way?
[12:14:36] <Kartagis> and jquery way too
[12:14:45] <Cork> Kartagis: if you want 5 td you need to call document.createElenent('td') 5 times
[12:14:58] <Cork> well with jqeury you just pass the html to $()
[12:15:02] <Cork> and your done ;)
[12:15:07] <Kartagis> then appendChild too?
[12:15:28] <Cork> Kartagis: appendChild just sets the parent reference on the node
[12:15:32] <Cork> it doesn't create an element
[12:15:40] <Cork> and as an element can only have one parent
[12:15:51] <Kartagis> I don't need appendChild?
[12:15:52] <Cork> the parent reference is replaced each time you call appendChild
[12:15:57] <Cork> you do
[12:16:03] <Cork> but you need to have a new element every time
[12:16:07] <Cork> or you just MOVE it
[12:17:16] <Cork> parnet1: {}, parnet2: {} parent1.appendChild(some) => parnet1: {some}, parnet2: {}
[12:17:23] <Kartagis> I need one createElement, and one appendChild
[12:17:27] <Cork> parnet1: {some}, parnet2: {} parent2.appendChild(some) => parnet1: {}, parnet2: {some}
[12:17:30] <Kartagis> in a loop
[12:17:33] <Cork> yes
[12:17:45] <Cork> though you prob want to use a fragment
[12:17:54] <Cork> as appending elements to the live dom in a loop is slow
[12:18:14] <Cork> or like i said before use $()
[12:19:16] <decx> do you want to fill your table with data?
[12:19:27] <Cork> var table = $('<table>'), tr = $('<tr>'); tr.append('<td>content</td>') (loop) table.append(tr); $(document.body).append(table);
[12:24:27] <Kartagis> decx: aye
[12:24:44] <decx> how is your data structured?
[12:25:56] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3y2r2hom/
[12:26:41] <decx> i aint seein no data
[12:28:14] <decx> have some data http://jsfiddle.net/3y2r2hom/2/
[12:38:31] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3y2r2hom/3/ hrm, this one prints 1 tr and 5 td's
[12:52:27] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryists
[12:52:46] <DelphiWorld> i want to use a news ticker
[12:52:58] <DelphiWorld> but where the news ticker plugins get the news from?
[12:56:46] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: You'd probably want an xml or json feed of some sort to do that.
[12:57:20] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: do you recomand rss or atom feeds?
[12:58:29] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I don't have a preference for either since I don't really use them.
[12:58:44] <DelphiWorld> ok BillCriswell thank dude
[12:58:51] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[12:59:08] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: to where? \o/
[12:59:44] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:00:33] <StephenS> YMCM
[13:00:44] <StephenS> BillCriswell you are the best YM I ever seen
[13:01:07] <DelphiWorld> StephenS: him and  robertmaxrees helped me so much
[13:01:14] <BillCriswell> /\o/\
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> 'swhat we do.
[13:01:25] <jeffmjack> So I want an array of the data-id attribute of all elements of a certain class... but $(".someClass").find("[data-id]").val() returns undefined....
[13:01:44] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: .map
[13:01:45] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack .val() is for the value fo inlue elements.
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> *of inout elements ^ use map.
[13:02:18] <Respek> Howdy all, anyone got a second to point out what is indubitably an obvious noob error? http://jsfiddle.net/dt3qfeye/
[13:02:19] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: ah thanks, I'll give it a try :)
[13:02:34] <BillCriswell> var ids = $('.someClass').map(function () { return $(this).data('id'); }).get(); I think?
[13:02:37] <robertmaxrees> and get a class on the elements you want to select.  attribute selectors are slow.  and data attributres may or may not actually exist on elements since .data() doesn't edit markup.
[13:02:57] <robertmaxrees> Respek casing :)
[13:02:59] <Respek> Oops, backstory is that I'm trying to figure out why my encodedlocation is not defined? http://jsfiddle.net/dt3qfeye/
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> Respek encodedLocation != encodedlocation
[13:03:23] <robertmaxrees> uppercase your L :D
[13:03:32] <Respek> lawl
[13:03:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dt3qfeye/1/ (bam)
[13:03:52] <Respek> thanks robertmaxrees, silly me
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> thank my linter.
[13:04:12] <robertmaxrees> it tells me when variables aren't defined and when they're unused.
[13:04:15] <robertmaxrees> i cheated basically.
[13:05:49] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: http://jsbin.com/nehuvitihiku/1/edit?html,js,output think that's what you want?
[13:05:52] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: I tried that but am getting an empty array; does map search children of divs having that class?
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> look at what BillCriswell gave you.
[13:06:25] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell:  sorry I was talking to you :)
[13:06:34] <Respek> robertmaxrees: what linter might that be?
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> also, for those of your who are curious, I use jshint gutter with sublime text 2
[13:06:45] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: No.
[13:06:45] <robertmaxrees> and this is my config for it: https://gist.github.com/robertmaxrees/5e1d67b3f10fc014f932
[13:08:00] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: http://jsbin.com/nehuvitihiku/2/edit?html,js,console,output maybe you want this?
[13:08:02] <schnarf> hello everyone
[13:08:09] <schnarf> quick question about the attacks
[13:08:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/ledocufoqiqi/1/edit jeffmjack like this - you still need the .find()
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> or BillCriswell can kick my ass.
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> should probably drop the data attribute selector, but I'm a stickler :D
[13:08:56] <robertmaxrees> schnarf we'll answer what we can.
[13:09:06] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Same thing haha.
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah same diff.
[13:09:26] <schnarf> I was on the site using the API documentation on the 18th.  Now nothing visibly occurred when I was one the site.  No prompts. No install requests. etc.  Could malware still have been installed?
[13:09:52] <robertmaxrees> gnarf s5fs what should we tell people in cases like schnarf's?
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> schnarf and btw - http://blog.jquery.com/2014/09/24/update-on-jquery-com-compromises/
[13:10:28] <schnarf> Please also keep mind that I've run both an antiviral and malware bytes scan. they were negative
[13:10:33] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: I think that's it.  lol you had figured it out by the time I managed to clone your first pastebin...
[13:14:47] <schnarf> robertmaxrees: I saw that blog post.  Thanks for the update.  Now if I'm wondering if I should reformat.
[13:15:45] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees could it be that having typeahead on dynamically created elements is somehow tricky? (in particular with the typeahead:selected event)
[13:16:11] <elmcrest> I just assume you're there right guty for this questions because you answered before :)
[13:16:15] <elmcrest> *guy
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest you can't bind events to things that don't yet exist.
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> i dunno know typeahead does it's magic, soooo...
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> it should be smart enough to do what you want (though I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do in the first place)
[13:18:40] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees I have a tablerow, I autocomplete from a ajax request, fill the tablerow while replacing the typeahead input. and append a new tablerow to do the same. think of a shooping cart but I add the items to it with autocompleting... at least thats the idea
[13:18:40] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: still not working.  I think maybe my syntax for selecting multiple classes is off?   here's the real line:      var ids = $('row row-condensed listings-container div div[data-id]').map(function () { return $(this).data('id'); }).get();
[13:18:52] <jeffmjack> also is it proper etiquette to paste single lines of code in chat?
[13:19:09] <jeffmjack> paste bin feels like overkill for that but I don't want to be rude
[13:19:12] <robertmaxrees> el_kevino i don't really have much experience with typeahead and I'd need to see some code...
[13:19:22] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: You need dots to select classes.
[13:19:39] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack it makes it easier to read when you use fixee/jsfiddle/etc btw.
[13:19:41] <BillCriswell> Right now you're looking for <row> <row-condensed> <listings-container> <div>
[13:19:48] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees:  oy thanks
[13:20:13] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Multiple classes would be like... <div class="foo bar"> -> .foo.bar
[13:20:14] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: oy thanks ;)
[13:20:14] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees may I pm you a link?
[13:20:21] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest if you can share with me you can share with the room :) i'm in the middle of something right now anyway :D
[13:20:40] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: no spaces for multiple classes?
[13:20:47] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Nope.
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack for multiple classes on the same element.
[13:21:01] <robertmaxrees> just like CSS
[13:21:23] <jeffmjack> awesome it worked! thanks guys :) :)
[13:21:33] <BillCriswell> weee
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> yhey
[13:21:39] <jeffmjack> :D
[13:22:30] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees yeah I'd prefer no to have the link to the dev server here... not that I wanted to hide something just because of logging etc :) ... but while developing the server in debug mode is quite open to anyone to literally execude code on my shell. anyway I try my luck with a jsbin, so no hurry ^^
[13:22:55] <robertmaxrees> kay
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> i get to dump back through the ecmascript documentation again.  yay me.
[13:23:56] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees sounds awesome ;)
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really.
[13:27:23] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees maybe I can motivate you to rather look at my code :) for short https://dpaste.de/WL6i   just in case ;)
[13:28:07] <elmcrest> but i should mention that this snippet is kind of broken... anyway ... just in case again :D
[13:28:29] <elmcrest> actually I should go to bed - my concentration level is near to zero
[13:28:58] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest do you mean $(".typeahead").bind('typeahead:selected', function(obj, position, name) doesn't work?
[13:29:15] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees yes I guess
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> because that's easy - replace that with a delegated listener - $('parent').on('typeahead:selected', '.typeahead', function() {}();
[13:29:40] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on() to learn a little more.
[13:29:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't bind to what doesn't yet exist, either way.
[13:29:57] <elmcrest> hey, nice :)
[13:30:58] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: what is get doing in the function you wrote for me?  seems like it's appending to the ids array but when I try to look up the function I just get stuff about making ajax requests
[13:31:16] <gnarf> schnarf - you are probably not infected, but if you wear tin-foil hats, go ahead and re-install
[13:31:48] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:32:10] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees nice this works ... kind of. at least the event listener. my appenTableRow is buggy but I think I can fix that. thx again! :)
[13:32:12] <gnarf> schnarf: only one person reported the "malware" attack on the 18th
[13:32:32] <gnarf> we never were able to see compromised content
[13:32:32] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack he's using $.fn.get(), not $.get() btw.  two different version.
[13:32:36] <robertmaxrees> *versions
[13:32:57] <BillCriswell> Oh, get haha
[13:33:30] <jeffmjack> so $.get() on an jquery object strips off the object from the array?
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack no - $.fn.get() does
[13:34:03] <jeffmjack> or I guess it's the jquery object method that is doing it
[13:34:06] <jeffmjack> right ok
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/get/ vs http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[13:34:43] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, $.fn.get() will fetch you a plain old array.  the docs for .map() even tell you this :D
[13:34:54] <jeffmjack> yeah I saw it :)
[13:35:00] <jeffmjack> thanks!
[13:35:06] <decx> should just rename fn.get() to fn.dom()
[13:35:16] <robertmaxrees> and then rename .eq() to .get()
[13:35:36] <decx> these same names are confusing
[13:35:42] <decx> for different stuff
[13:35:57] <decx> then again i guess $.get is just a shortcut anyway
[13:36:41] <jesselang> How can I move to the bottom of a qjm page?
[13:36:56] <jesselang> Programatically?
[13:37:56] <BillCriswell> You can set the scrollTop of window to the height of the document
[13:38:35] <jesselang> Thanks BillCriswell
[13:39:09] <BillCriswell> $(window).scrollTop($(document).height()) works... feels clunky though?
[13:40:35] <decx> guess scrollMaxY is a thing
[13:41:31] <BillCriswell> decx: That sounds like a 1980's MC
[13:41:48] <decx> only in ff apparently
[13:45:15] <BillCriswell> decx: I'd probably just do something like .scrollTop(212381912839128) to be honest.
[13:45:39] <decx> yeah it only matters if you want to keep track of the current scrollposition
[13:45:53] <zeroquake> when a element is removed from dom , all jquery selector references to it are destroyed correct?
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake clarify?
[13:46:13] <decx> if it's remove()'ed yes
[13:46:17] <decx> if you detach it no
[13:46:54] <jimi_> To bind to DOMNodeInserted, i also have to fire an event when its created? Basically, I want to fire a method when an element when a certain class is created.
[13:46:58] <zeroquake> example , i have a dialog box , i jquery select a  div in that , when i close the dialog box , i remove it from dom
[13:47:29] <zeroquake> the jquery selector should no longer have any reference to that correct
[13:47:43] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake $('selector') won't, correct.
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ mutation obervers and their ilk are hacky.  try to explicitly call the logic you need instead.
[13:48:25] <zeroquake> i am not sure how to put this in jsfiddle but , i have crazy problem that i cant make head or tail of .
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> are you caching the selector instead?
[13:48:58] <robertmaxrees> var myThing = $('myThing')?
[13:49:04] <zeroquake> yes
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> that won't update.
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you have to "re-cache" it.
[13:49:59] <zeroquake> code that assigns  it actually runs again so it should have the newer data
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're doing, then.
[13:50:17] <zeroquake> highlevel description of my problem is
[13:51:52] <zeroquake> assume you have  a method (which create a modal dialog and stores all its properties in object ) -- similar way u have a method to create buttons( properties like onclick events , size etc are stored in an object) , buttons are added into the modal dialog method
[13:52:32] <robertmaxrees> could you just share your JS?
[13:52:35] <zeroquake> or i guess it is chrome caching some stuff
[13:52:42] <zeroquake> cant that is issue...propertiary
[13:53:03] <robertmaxrees> the problem is you're describing what should happen, but you have a bug that you can't figure out.
[13:53:24] <zeroquake> yes somewhere a state is stagnating ...
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code in question, it's basically impossible for us to help.
[13:53:42] <zeroquake> yes i understand , am not sure where i should start looking at
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> try replacing every use of the cached value with a selector instead.
[13:53:46] <NoiseEee> also nobody is going to steal your amazing awesome code
[13:53:50] <Respek> Question: how would one encode this: ("Palo Alto, CA, United States") to achieve this: Palo+Alto%2C+CA%2C+United+States ?
[13:53:51] <robertmaxrees> also check out learn.jquery.com
[13:53:53] <Respek> When I use encodeURIComponent I get Palo%2BAlto%252C%2BCA%252C%2BUnited%2BStates
[13:54:06] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ zeroquake
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> Respek you need to use .replace()
[13:54:18] <zeroquake> NoiseEee -- it is not about stealing .....it is understanding rules in contract
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> err, fixingthesejquery I mean ^ that site's awesome.
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake will the site ever be publically facing?
[13:54:34] <zeroquake> nopes
[13:54:48] <NoiseEee> zeroquake: well give that latest link a whirl, good luck
[13:54:59] <robertmaxrees> Respek you'll have to manually do your own .replace() or change your encoding needs.
[13:55:04] <zeroquake> yes , thank you going thru it
[13:55:20] <Respek> attr won't cut it?
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:59] <Respek> var location = $(this).attr("data-location");
[13:55:59] <Respek>     var encodedLocation = encodeURIComponent(location);
[13:55:59] <Respek>     $('#jobOpeningsButton').attr('href', 'http://website.com/careers/openings/?location='+encodedLocation);
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> don't paste multiline into the channel pls.
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> .attr() just sets the value, doesn't transform anything for you.
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> also, you want .prop() usually, not .attr().
[13:56:35] <Respek> apologies.
[13:56:45] <robertmaxrees> and use .data() when handling data attributes.
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> .data('location');
[13:57:21] <robertmaxrees> the escaping you want isn't actual URI encoding, so you have to manually replace characters you want.
[13:58:56] <hlvwrk> ✖ ❤ ✖
[13:58:58] <hlvwrk> dat love
[14:00:18] <schnarf> gnarf: Sorry.  Was in a meeting.  Thanks for the update. I feel much better now. All the best.
[14:05:18] <zeroquake> ok , i think i have understanding of whats happening , so i store a selector in a varialbe in some object .
[14:06:36] <robertmaxrees> ok
[14:08:05] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/qp847e4w/  i have something similar to this going on
[14:08:42] <zeroquake> but in the jsfiddle , it works correctly , notice the z.obj.find('#3')
[14:09:21] <zeroquake> that is place where my code is failing , it doesnt see the new dom , instead it is manipulating the state of dom that it stored initially in x
[14:09:28] <Respek> robertmaxrees: sorry again about that multi line, won't happen again.
[14:10:04] <robertmaxrees> Respek nbd yo
[14:11:10] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake you realize z.obj and x reference the same object, right?
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> so updates to one will impact the other?
[14:11:49] <zeroquake> yes , hmm , will dig deeper into my code. thank you
[14:12:34] <robertmaxrees> start setting breakpoints and stuff.
[14:12:34] <Paradisee> is there a way to grab the second class of an element?
[14:12:35] <Paradisee> var category = ui.draggable.attr('class');
[14:13:15] <Paradisee> <img id='light' class='widget lights' src='../static/images/light.png'>
[14:13:16] <robertmaxrees> .prop('class').split(' ')[1], but that's not a good idea.
[14:13:23] <robertmaxrees> since you can't guarantee the order of classes.
[14:13:28] <robertmaxrees> do you want to see if it has a class?
[14:13:40] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i need to grab the class lights
[14:13:59] <Paradisee> but it changes on each element
[14:14:08] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can't gaurantee class order, sooo...
[14:14:19] <Paradisee> ya...so? :D
[14:14:26] <robertmaxrees> grabbing "the second class" isn't a good idea.  do you want to grab the class that ISN'T widget?
[14:14:42] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: yes..but i have more than 2 class
[14:14:55] <robertmaxrees> then use a data attribute to hold the data you need.
[14:15:02] <robertmaxrees> or use .hasClass() to detect if a class exists.
[14:15:11] <Paradisee> what do you mean
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> classes aren't a great place to store data like that.
[14:17:33] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: it is like a reference for me
[14:17:43] <Paradisee> i have no other way to make this..
[14:18:43] <Paradisee> i would store that on another attribute..but this isn't really the best way to do it
[14:19:22] <Respek> robertmaxrees: you don't mind getting so many questions?
[14:19:45] <decx> it's like crack for him
[14:24:11] <Respek> decx: lol, I'm serious though! How can he have so much time to help? I appreciate it, but wow
[14:24:35] <ryanneufeld> I learned most of what I know by helping people in here
[14:24:50] <Paradisee> helping is one of the way to learn :D
[14:25:35] <Respek> One of my favorite philosophers said "when we teach, we learn"
[14:26:43] <Paradisee> Respek: who was it
[14:26:46] <Paradisee> Respek: who was he
[14:26:55] <Respek> Seneca
[14:27:48] <Paradisee> he is back
[14:28:53] <Respek> robertmaxrees: I was wondering how you managed to help so much :)
[14:33:00] <Respek> lol by ignoring useless questions
[14:34:13] <zeroquake> two jquery selectors for the same div , are two different objects?
[14:36:15] <gnarf> zeroquake - yes
[14:36:23] <gnarf> zeroquake $() !== $()
[14:36:30] <gnarf> each time you call $() you create a new selection
[14:37:39] <Paradisee> is correct to use the attribute alt= as a reference ?
[14:37:42] <zeroquake> oh man , thats what is happening to me , i assigning the selector again...thus new objects being created and referenced .
[14:37:52] <Paradisee> or should i use any other attribute?
[14:38:15] <gnarf> zeroquake: see `api .is
[14:38:19] <gnarf> `api .is
[14:38:19] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[14:38:23] <gnarf> :(
[14:38:36] <gnarf> zeroquake: http://api.jquery.com/is
[14:40:48] <zeroquake> thanks gnarf and robertmaxrees
[14:40:52] <decx> is this still about the dialog?
[14:43:08] <robertmaxrees> sorry kicking around a lot.
[14:43:22] <robertmaxrees> Respek my employer is cool and lets me hang out in here.  my boss is in here sometimes, too, watching.
[14:45:34] <robertmaxrees> decx is right, it IS like crack for me.
[14:45:59] <Paradisee> i can cook crack for you
[14:46:10] <Paradisee> until my project ends
[14:46:11] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, i think i'm good.
[14:46:41] <Paradisee> did you read above?
[14:46:58] <robertmaxrees> oh that's what you mean hahaha
[14:47:31] <Paradisee> lol, im not going to sell you crack don't worry
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[14:48:12] <Paradisee> terrible stuff
[14:48:24] <robertmaxrees> hell one of my objectives over the next fiscal year at work includes fixing a bug in jquery core.
[14:48:28] <robertmaxrees> any bug i want
[14:48:30] <Paradisee> it is kind of "a train into your heart"
[14:49:18] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: which attribute could i use as a reference?
[14:49:30] <robertmaxrees> i'd use data attributes.
[14:49:45] <Paradisee> what about alt?
[14:49:47] <decx> which attribute as a reference?
[14:49:51] <decx> class ^^
[14:49:57] <Paradisee> decx: i would :D
[14:50:09] <decx> or id
[14:50:09] <Paradisee> already have 2 classes on the same element
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> they were looking for "the second class" on an element.
[14:50:22] <Paradisee> if you can find me a way to take the class i want i will
[14:50:32] <Paradisee> also the id, is already taken
[14:50:51] <decx> you can use as many classes as you wish
[14:50:57] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to determine a class based off an index, which is the problem.
[14:51:01] <robertmaxrees> you could use .hasClass()
[14:51:10] <robertmaxrees> or use a data attribute to store the thing you're looking for instead.
[14:51:17] <Paradisee> i know decx, but i have lot of elements inside the page"widgets"
[14:51:26] <decx> is there a fiddle?
[14:51:30] <Paradisee> they have different classes
[14:51:42] <Paradisee> they just have 1 in common
[14:51:50] <Paradisee> and i need to grab the otherone
[14:52:14] <Paradisee> decx: nope...but i can paste the code here
[14:52:27] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1J6TJ4Q
[14:52:36] <Paradisee> im using alt= as a reference
[14:52:46] <decx> the map again huh
[14:52:53] <robertmaxrees> btw use .prop() instead of .attr()
[14:53:09] <robertmaxrees> in this case, use a data attribute instead of alt
[14:53:12] <Paradisee> decx: unfortunally i have to work all the whole day, and i just have the night where i can work on this one
[14:53:15] <decx> you still use if (ui.draggable.is('.widget')) {
[14:53:28] <decx> instead of if (ui.draggable.closest('#widgets').length) {
[14:53:36] <decx> like i told you yesterday
[14:53:52] <Paradisee> decx: well, that doesn't make sense for me
[14:54:28] <decx> it did in yesterdays fiddl3e
[14:54:51] <decx> should have made an acc i cant find it now of course
[14:54:52] <decx> ^^
[14:54:54] <Paradisee> i think im fine with if (ui.draggable.is('.widget')) {
[14:55:28] <Paradisee> so it only happens if im dragging an element with class widget
[14:55:43] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: which data att do you suggest
[14:55:46] <decx> the class gets copied in your clone
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee  whatever you want to name it.
[14:56:05] <Paradisee> decx: i change the value of the clone :D
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> data-myThingINeed
[14:56:14] <decx> use the parent length test to only fire the drop when you are dropping a new item into the map
[14:56:18] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: never used one :D
[14:56:34] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can add them in markup like any other.
[14:56:44] <robertmaxrees> <div data-anyNameHere="some value"></div>
[14:56:45] <Paradisee> so just adding data-sdsidhsidhis
[14:56:54] <robertmaxrees> in jquery you can do .dta('anyNamHere')
[14:56:55] <Paradisee> that's cool
[14:57:01] <Respek> robertmaxrees: that sounds great :) I always really appreciate it
[14:57:08] <Paradisee> i have another question...
[14:57:09] <robertmaxrees> to set it do .data('anyNameHere', 'some value');
[14:57:18] <Paradisee> i'd like to use an image where i can drop elements...
[14:57:21] <Paradisee> instead of a div
[15:00:27] <decx> you do have an account
[15:00:40] <decx> thank based firefox adressbar
[15:01:05] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/10/
[15:01:46] <Paradisee> decx: yep, does it change so much?
[15:02:39] <decx> it doesnt require you to copy all that draggable stuff for the new draggable() call
[15:03:34] <Paradisee> it still has clone.draggable()
[15:04:27] <Paradisee> btw, you can check the code here: https://bitbucket.org/Paradisee/pydomotic/src/46510d849bd75165ee24a586fa4dbbfd137577e9?at=default
[15:04:48] <decx> i'm going to watch ds9 now
[15:04:52] <Paradisee> o/
[15:04:57] <decx> \o
[15:11:47] <Paradisee> well, thanks guys...good night o/
[15:13:17] <Respek> this is a simple one, is this a good way to add a number to this content?  $('#jobOpeningsButton').replaceWith( "<a class="button" id="jobOpeningsButton" href="#">"jobCount + "<p>Job Openings</p>"");
[15:13:57] <Respek> b/c it seems like that'd do the trick, alternately I guess I don't really know how to just target the text on the button
[15:14:47] <robertmaxrees> .text() will get you the text of an element.
[15:14:56] <robertmaxrees> .text('new text here') will replace it
[15:15:18] <mooncup> put a span where the jobcount is
[15:15:22] <mooncup> then give it an id
[15:15:35] <mooncup> then do $('#spanid').html(jobCount)
[15:15:38] <Respek> google searching replacing content must've been what threw me off. lot's of references to solving it with replace
[15:15:48] <Respek> mooncup: Oh there's an idea!
[15:15:50] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/541nqcqp/
[15:15:56] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do it ;)
[15:16:50] <Respek> Y'all are so great. I'm really loving learning with you all. I really appreciate it so much
[15:17:25] <Otineb> this place is the best
[15:17:42] <Otineb> Hi all. does anyone know the best method to find the last val() of an input box? (I have 3 and need to select the last one WITH a value)
[15:19:05] <mooncup> er maybe something like this. var lastVal; $('input').each(function() { lastval = $(this).val(); });
[15:19:17] <Respek> I'm going to have to hang out here after I get out of work to try to learn and help too :D
[15:19:41] <decx> that's the spirit
[15:19:45] <mooncup> you'll need to add a check in there to see if it has a value actually Otineb
[15:19:55] <Otineb> mooncup: ah durrr
[15:20:08] <mooncup> but once you do that you should be golden
[15:20:22] <mooncup> if($(this).val()) or something similar
[15:20:33] <Otineb> mooncup: totally forgot that the each would jut return the last that returned true
[15:20:35] <mooncup> or if you want to allow 0 then you'd need to check the length
[15:20:42] <Otineb> mooncup: let me try it
[15:21:16] <mooncup> var lastVal; $('input').each(function() { if($(this).val().length > 0) { lastval = $(this).val(); } });
[15:21:47] <robertmaxrees> you can also just to if ($(this).val().length) - 0 is falsy
[15:22:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably use .map() in this case though.
[15:22:31] <mooncup> yeah you can probably use map too
[15:22:34] <mooncup> I've never really looked into it
[15:22:37] <mooncup> I probably should
[15:22:38] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: whoa… .map()… never used that one
[15:23:05] <robertmaxrees> $('input').map(function() { return ($(this).val().length) });
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> something like that should work
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> t you should be golden
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> [2014:09:24:15:20:32] <mooncup> if($(this).val()) o
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> woops
[15:23:12] <shoky> you mean filter
[15:23:19] <shoky> no?
[15:23:33] <robertmaxrees> wait did you want the value or the object?
[15:23:37] <decx> map?
[15:24:02] <decx> like inputs.map(function(){ (this.value) && return this.value }).pop()
[15:24:06] <decx> does that even work
[15:24:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery map
[15:24:14] <shoky> no
[15:24:15] <decx> map isnt an array
[15:24:20] <decx> as we sadly found out
[15:24:22] <mooncup> so what's the difference between .map and .each in real terms?
[15:24:33] <decx> map returns an array like object
[15:24:34] <shoky> map builds an array out of the return values
[15:24:37] <decx> each loops
[15:24:41] <decx> well both loop
[15:24:53] <Otineb> mooncup: robertmaxrees : ultimately I have to find the last field with a value and concat a string. first, I have to figure out if the current value + string exceed the input field’s max characters.
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> *jquery object out of the return values if you're talking jquery's map
[15:25:21] <shoky> righto
[15:25:33] <mooncup> ah right robertmaxrees
[15:25:49] <mooncup> well since he wants a single value rather than an array wouldn't each be more suited?
[15:26:12] <shoky> think i'd go for  $('input').filter(function() { return this.value }).last().val()  :|
[15:26:34] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways to skin that cat.
[15:26:55] <Otineb> mooncup: robertmaxrees: shoky : I’ll need to test against the current input val()
[15:27:09] <shoky> === whatever?
[15:27:12] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Otineb
[15:27:12] <b-ot> Otineb: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:27:14] <robertmaxrees> :D
[15:27:17] <Otineb> mooncup: robertmaxrees shoky: you guys rock. Gonna do some experiementation
[15:27:19] <Otineb> lol
[15:27:19] <Otineb> o
[15:27:20] <Otineb> k
[15:27:30] <Otineb> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/vaj2y30f/2/
[15:27:41] <Otineb> just started so == null =)
[15:27:59] <decx> $(this).val() will be this.value most of the time
[15:28:23] <robertmaxrees> oooh, you could get really weird for this.
[15:28:38] <decx> let's get weird
[15:28:41] <Otineb> hahaha
[15:28:52] <decx> cant find a good mcpoyle image
[15:28:55] <mooncup> Otineb: it works http://jsfiddle.net/5pv1ygyp/
[15:29:32] <mooncup> wait I put the console log in the wrong place
[15:29:50] <mooncup> http://jsfiddle.net/5pv1ygyp/1/ there we go
[15:30:35] <Otineb> line 10?
[15:30:37] <Otineb> yea
[15:31:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vaj2y30f/3/
[15:31:10] <robertmaxrees> this gets weird.
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> iterate over the collection backwards to get what you want and break out when you're done
[15:32:17] <shoky> weirdo
[15:32:17] <mooncup> the only thing with that is
[15:32:28] <mooncup> if he wants the last field with the value rather than the first
[15:32:35] <mooncup> depends which way round he wants to go I guess
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> that's what they said - the last field with a value.
[15:32:45] <mooncup> backwards for loops always scare me though
[15:32:51] <mooncup> something about them doesn't feel right
[15:33:04] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/xw4c99Lk/ lol
[15:33:04] <robertmaxrees> the fact that they're faster than traditional for loops? ;)
[15:33:13] <mooncup> how come?
[15:33:17] <khmer_> they're not in modern engines
[15:33:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah not any more.
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> but the length gets cached
[15:33:27] <khmer_> the traditional code snippet for them caches the loop length
[15:33:31] <Otineb> right. I have figure out the last with value.. then ensure that the current value + a hard-coded string (“foofoofoo”) can fit within the character limit (28). If not, then I have to add it to the next input box
[15:33:34] <khmer_> which you can do in a forward loop just fine
[15:33:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:33:44] <khmer_> it's not reversing that's faster
[15:33:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ khmer_ is right.
[15:34:07] <khmer_> and i'm also khmer_ , what the heck
[15:34:15] <robertmaxrees> haha\
[15:34:20] <Otineb> haha
[15:34:22] <mooncup> I dunno I think you looked better with the underscore
[15:34:23] <mooncup> more manly
[15:34:32] <khmer> lopsided
[15:34:44] <khmer> i'd need it on both sides for the effect to be truly virile
[15:34:49] <Otineb> like your username was carrying a sword
[15:35:03] <mooncup> yeah but tab completion would be a bitch
[15:35:18] <khmer> more like my username thought there was one more stair step and stomped clumsily on the patio while carrying a tea tray
[15:35:23] <decx> going backwards, not bad robertmaxrees
[15:35:26] <Otineb> haha
[15:35:46] <robertmaxrees> decx i don't like the idea of relying on "backwards" in relation to markup, but meh.
[15:35:52] <khmer> anyway what probably feels weird about going backwards is that it's not very Functional
[15:35:53] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:35:55] <jimi_> What's the best way to clear events from an element before attaching some to it? $(element).off('keyup').on('keyup') ?
[15:36:11] <decx> but what's with the for, while(inputsLength--)
[15:36:26] <khmer> jimi_: you're not guaranteed for that to work either--events could be delegated
[15:36:48] <mooncup> only way to make sure no events get run would be event.preventPropogation I guess?
[15:37:13] <mooncup> wait it's stopPropagation
[15:37:33] <mooncup> anyway sleepy time
[15:37:34] <mooncup> night all
[15:37:42] <Otineb> mooncup: night dude
[15:37:45] <Otineb> thanks again
[15:37:48] <mooncup> np
[15:37:49] <jimi_> what about checking to see if it has events attached t out
[15:38:02] <decx> $._data(elem,'events')
[15:38:19] <decx> note that it's the elem not a jquery obj
[15:39:02] <jimi_> so i can do like $('#foo')[0]
[15:39:05] <shoky> and, only works for event handlers added with jquery, directly on this element
[15:40:12] <robertmaxrees> weee
[15:40:21] <robertmaxrees> be careful with _data() anything btw.
[15:41:17] <Otineb> is www.jquery.com down for anyone else?
[15:41:35] <Otineb> "Error establishing a database connection"
[15:41:38] <robertmaxrees> looks like it.
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> fuck do I have to call gnarf?
[15:42:16] <Otineb> clicked a link to their get() doc and got an error “getting” it… irony
[15:42:35] <Otineb> ba-dump-dump
[15:42:45] <jimi_> jquery.com database is down
[15:43:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[15:43:11] <decx> in the meantime http://devdocs.io/jquery/
[15:43:26] <Otineb> decx: NICE thanks
[15:43:50] <robertmaxrees> it's up and down.
[15:43:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[15:44:36] <decx> like that 90s song
[15:45:08] <shoky> barbie girl?????????
[15:45:16] <Otineb> LOL
[15:45:34] <decx> had to look it up
[15:45:43] <decx> vengaboys != barbie girl band
[15:45:50] <Otineb> lol
[15:45:58] <robertmaxrees> vengaboys != band
[15:46:05] <shoky> ;D
[15:46:19] <decx> neither is barbie girl band
[15:46:27] <decx> 90s eurotrash
[15:47:26] <decx> well i remember being like 14 and taking great pleasure from that vengaboys video
[15:48:09] <shoky> tell us about your pleasure
[15:48:49] <decx> liveshow cxxx
[15:50:01] <shoky> okokok
[15:50:13] <Otineb> man you meant it when you said you were getting weird
[15:51:35] <shoky> http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2XV2bVamPCI/maxresdefault.jpg
[15:51:54] <ebernhardson> what would be the suggested method to get the pixel measurement of the bottom of an element(including padding/margin/etc) ?  Can do something like `$el.offset().top + $el.height()` but the problem there is any padding/margin/border on the top isn't taken into account
[15:52:12] <Otineb> shoky: haha
[15:52:32] <decx> a dog wearing makeup, and it's not even closing hours in the pub on a saturday
[15:53:30] <decx> try .outerHeight(true) ebernhardson
[15:53:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:54:07] <ebernhardson> decx: thats it exactly, thanks!
[15:54:25] <robertmaxrees> this has been an interesting few days.
[15:57:11] <s5fs> robertmaxrees: Down again.
[15:57:17] <s5fs> Working on it, thanks everyone.
[15:57:39] <robertmaxrees> cool - called Gnarf about it, too.
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> though I think they you already knew by the time I called.
[15:58:49] <s5fs> robertmaxrees: you have gnarf's number?
[15:59:03] <gnarf> gave it to him as i left earlier ;)
[15:59:09] <s5fs> haha cool man
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> ring-a-ding.
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> you guys are the best btw.  really kicking ass the last few days.
[16:00:54] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: Expanding on your fiddle a bit, how would i grab freshly evaluated result and append the string? I’ve come this close (http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z0tu1nhs/1/) but … i think something’s off
[16:01:06] <s5fs> Thanks, that feels good to hear. Bit of a grind trying to figure this out, just trying to keep things running for you good folks..
[16:01:28] <robertmaxrees> s5fs your efforts are appreciated :) especially in light of everything else going on.
[16:02:09] <robertmaxrees> Otineb those two links are the same btw.  try using .eq() instead of .get()
[16:02:13] <decx> Otineb you cant use .val() if you use .get() as there is not val method
[16:02:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:02:32] <decx> right, eq up in that
[16:02:41] <Otineb> ok
[16:02:46] <Otineb> standby
[16:03:05] <robertmaxrees> or do the newb thing: $($('input')[1]).val() and feel the cringe
[16:03:18] <Otineb> lol
[16:03:20] <Otineb> i can’t do that
[16:03:33] <Otineb> since the user determines which fields they choose to fill out
[16:04:13] <Otineb> BOOM
[16:04:19] <Otineb> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z0tu1nhs/2/
[16:04:26] <Otineb> you guys are rockstars
[16:04:50] <Otineb> well, i feel like s5fs and gnarf might be the real rockstars here.
[16:05:03] <Otineb> i wanted to get someone’s autograph
[16:05:44] <Otineb> like, my whole job exists because of jquery. are they team devs?
[16:06:23] <decx> thank you for doing backend, travel down the log and back again. your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant ♫
[16:06:26] <s5fs> Otineb: come to a jquery conference, we're always hanging around and happy to talk shop :D
[16:06:46] <mrbubbles> So my Rails API is returning: {1410281280: 2455.5151515151515,1410283008: 2449.603448275862} (a JSON object) but Highcharts wants: [[1410281280,2455.5151515151515],[1410283008,2449.603448275862]] (a 2d array) = is there a helper in jQuery to go from one to the other? Or will I just use .each() to iterate through and build the array?
[16:06:47] <Otineb> s5fs: WILL DO
[16:06:50] <robertmaxrees> s5fs you guys do san diego next year?
[16:09:05] <ryanneufeld> Otineb: just look for the team badges. We like talking with everyone. We're all friendly
[16:09:40] <ryanneufeld> robertmaxrees: we don't usually do the same city twice, but next years schedule hasn't been announced yet
[16:09:58] <Otineb> ryanneufeld: sweet. I’ll buy the first round
[16:10:08] <robertmaxrees> that's fair.  i'm looking forward to being able to go for the first time.
[16:10:20] <decx> mrbubbles $.map()
[16:10:26] <ryanneufeld> robertmaxrees: I hope you can make it. They're always a good time
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> i've heard.  my boss and an old coworker went a few years ago and really enjoyed it.
[16:15:42] <s5fs> Okay we're up!
[16:15:50] <Otineb> woot
[16:16:15] <s5fs> Just a little 'settling in' issue on the new host.
[16:28:46] <mrbubbles> Does anyone know any charting libraries which show an overview of the entire dataaset as a chart and then allow you to click/drag to zoom in on an area? Apart from Highcharts that is ;)
[16:29:56] <decx> didnt $.map() work to flatten your object into an array?
[16:31:48] <mrbubbles> I'm just doing that now, but thought I'd investigate more 'modern' chart options
[16:32:16] <Paradisee> decx: id like to remember each position of every element i drop into the <div>, how could i make it?
[16:32:47] <Paradisee> so when i load the map again, i got every element back to their original position, where they were dropped
[16:33:40] <decx> probably somewhere in draggable data
[16:33:56] <decx> or something like $draggeditems.map(function(){ return $(this).position() })
[16:34:28] <Paradisee> i can store the position in the json, but will they change if i use another browser?
[16:34:44] <decx> that's a backend issue
[16:35:23] <Paradisee> this is a web interface for my home automation...
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to save the data that you're changing?
[16:37:09] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: what do you mean
[16:37:28] <robertmaxrees> "i can store the position in the json, but will they change if i use another browser?" <- clarify this :)
[16:37:30] <decx> you drag a couple of images in your container, then you click a save button, that posts the mapped positions to your server. now when you build the page next time you access the data you just saved to build your markup
[16:37:58] <decx> did i just describe the internet?
[16:38:01] <decx> close enough
[16:38:02] <Paradisee> decx: those dropped elements have to be clickable
[16:38:33] <Paradisee> that drag and drop that im making, is just a page to configure the home automation
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee right - and when you drop something you want those values to save, right?
[16:39:00] <Paradisee> ya
[16:39:06] <Paradisee> i will save them to the json
[16:39:11] <Paradisee> and load them from it
[16:39:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to store that data on a server then.
[16:39:26] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ofc, on the json
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> changing the json in the page won't do that magically.
[16:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to send that data to your server somehow.
[16:39:55] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: that's how im doing actually
[16:40:07] <decx> in your serverside logic you can now use that data to build your markup
[16:40:29] <Paradisee> but im pretty sure that if i see the page from another browser they won't be display like here
[16:40:51] <decx> nn
[16:40:54] <Paradisee> o/
[16:41:13] <robertmaxrees> right, your server needs to provide the updated data.
[16:41:59] <Paradisee> will be hard to manage i suppose
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> simple CRUD.
[16:42:54] <Paradisee> is it? :D
[16:43:24] <Paradisee> this is really painful
[16:43:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.  create, read, update, delete
[16:44:10] <Paradisee> probably with the right width and height, it could be done easly..
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:44:27] <robertmaxrees> that part has nothing to do with styling.
[16:44:45] <Paradisee> well, if you have a div with a fixed width...
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> it's a basic datastore-driven application concept.
[16:45:01] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: that wont be a problem
[16:45:29] <Paradisee> i'm a python programmer, so it is pretty simple for me...the actually problem is to manage it with js
[16:45:32] <Paradisee> and ofc, some css
[16:45:46] <robertmaxrees> those parts are easy, too.  just decouple your data from your logic.
[16:45:49] <robertmaxrees> and don't generate javascript.
[16:46:36] <Paradisee> well, don't forget my project..so if i need help i will ask here
[16:46:47] <Paradisee> sure enough i will
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> lol i'll probably forget in the next hour or two ;)
[16:47:09] <robertmaxrees> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast, and i eat the same thing every day.
[16:47:10] <Paradisee> probably
[16:47:36] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: case statements vs nested if statements: What are your thoughts?
[16:47:44] <Paradisee> brrr
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> Otineb really depends.
[16:47:57] <Paradisee> lot's if statement are terrible
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> using either usually means you're coupling data and logic too much probably.
[16:48:27] <Paradisee> i think you need to make it more simpler
[16:48:45] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: so back to my fiddle… adding layers of complexity here. Checkout line 27. Trying to answer the question on line 37. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z0tu1nhs/4/
[16:49:12] <mrbubbles> decx: I'm using map, how can i access the key though? I only seem to be able to access the value :(
[16:49:30] <Paradisee> Otineb: break; //stop iterating
[16:49:34] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: my current plan is to ignore the char limit on #box3 and just concat like a crazy person
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> Otineb what exactly is this trying to accomplish at the end of the day?
[16:50:02] <Paradisee> goin to bed o/
[16:51:00] <Otineb> the user has a toggle (see select). If that is toggled, it appends the string to the LAST input box that has room - unless it’s the VERY last box (#box3), then it will simply append there as a last resort
[16:51:21] <robertmaxrees> okay, then update your else if to include two conditions.
[16:51:33] <Otineb> if the user changes their mind and chooses “no” on the select then the concat string gets removed
[16:52:58] <Otineb> ok. so else if (input == #box3 || val.length > 10) { concat(); } ?
[16:53:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:55:46] <robertmaxrees> also, if ($("#fooSelect option:selected").val() != "no") { - if you're only ever going to have 2 options, do equality for truthiness.
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> if ($("#fooSelect option:selected").val() === "yes") {
[16:56:17] <Otineb> ah
[16:57:08] <Otineb> eventually I’m adding an else at the end there that will find the concat string and remove it if !== “yes”
[16:57:31] <mrbubbles> So I'm trying to return an aray of values from a json object : [[a,b],[a,b],[a,b]] etc and I'm using $.map( response, function(val, i) { return [i, val]; }); but that seems to be returning [a,b,a,b,a,b] am I doing something stupid?
[16:58:48] <robertmaxrees> Otineb btw do something like this for your truth check: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z0tu1nhs/5/
[16:59:20] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: squeaky clean!
[16:59:42] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles can you do a jsfiddle with the current data and what you want it to look like?
[17:01:42] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: do i have my else if in the right place? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z0tu1nhs/6/
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> that's saying "if the length < 10, do the concat, otherwise, if it's currently #box3 OR the length is greater than 10, do the other one.
[17:02:33] <robertmaxrees> btw use a .prop not a .attr()
[17:03:11] <Otineb> attr() no good?
[17:03:22] <robertmaxrees> .prop() access the underlying dom node.
[17:03:22] <Otineb> AH I see.
[17:03:26] <Otineb> ah
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> and is the actual thing you want 9/10 :)
[17:03:38] <Otineb> i see
[17:03:56] <Otineb> will update internal process!
[17:04:04] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/e0wc9c84/ thanks for looking
[17:04:46] <robertmaxrees> eeewwww....
[17:04:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't do this in your backend btw?
[17:06:46] <mrbubbles> I'm not sure if the 'required format' is valid json
[17:06:53] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> arrays are object.
[17:07:01] <mrbubbles> Aaah. Maybe I shoud do it in the back end hen
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e0wc9c84/1/
[17:07:14] <robertmaxrees> this is the JS way, but the format is valid JS.
[17:07:28] <robertmaxrees> it's an array of arrays
[17:08:34] <mrbubbles> Yep. Okay I should probably adapt my back end then
[17:08:35] <mrbubbles> Thanks :)
[17:08:43] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[17:08:48] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: got it! had to check for #box3 first
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> Otineb awesome :)
[17:09:07] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: closure http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/z0tu1nhs/7/
[17:09:24] <Otineb> i’ll get to the removal of the str tomorrow
[17:09:24] <robertmaxrees> now hook up the event listener ;)
[17:09:30] <Otineb> a wha?
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:09:39] <Otineb> lol
[17:09:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll get it tomorrow ;)
[17:09:52] <Otineb> love you robertmaxrees
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:13:40] <mrbubbles> night all, thanks for your help :)
[18:12:12] <panaggio> I have a curious case here. I'm not sure if this is a bug or feature, that's why I'm asking
[18:13:09] <panaggio> I'm using $(<selector>).pagecontainer('change', '#home', { changeHash: false }) on my app
[18:13:47] <panaggio> I navigate somewhere, say, #foo, and then I hit back
[18:14:03] <panaggio> I'm sent back to /, not #home
[18:14:29] <panaggio> Not sure if it's clear
[18:14:53] <panaggio> I'm on /, navigate to #home with changeHash: true, than nagivate to #foo, and than hit back
[18:15:13] <panaggio> I expected it to go back to #home, but I was sent back to /
[18:15:18] <panaggio> any ideias?
[18:22:30] <wa5ted> sometimes what i do when using git: https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/8319878144/hC75813ED/
[18:37:49] <Grundell> Hello
[18:38:32] <Grundell> I'm currently developing a theme and i use grunt to handle everything
[18:39:21] <Grundell> The problem i have is when i try to get a third party js such as owl carousel JShint kills everything
[18:39:35] <Grundell> Is there a way to work around this or is there a compatible js out there
[18:55:55] <gnarf> Grundell: you can tell jshint to ignore specific files
[18:56:00] <tejas-manohar> hey guys
[18:56:11] <tejas-manohar> $("img").each(function(){       console.log(this);     });
[18:56:14] <tejas-manohar> im using .each
[18:56:20] <Grundell> gnarf: Yeah did- the problem is that the js isnt registered then ... :/
[18:56:23] <tejas-manohar> and there are multiple <img> tags how do i loop through them
[18:56:33] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Can I PM? Stupid question.
[18:56:40] <gnarf> BillCriswell feel free
[18:56:47] <tejas-manohar> like i cant go this[0] or this[1] for some readson :(
[18:56:52] <tejas-manohar> how do i say which one in order i want
[18:57:06] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: $("img") is an array-like
[18:57:14] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: var images = $('img')
[18:57:17] <gnarf> also
[18:57:29] <gnarf> that function inside each is passed index, element
[18:57:47] <gnarf> so function(i) { console.log(i, this); }
[18:57:54] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: oh
[18:58:08] <gnarf> see also api.jquery.com/get and api.jquery.com/eq
[18:58:16] <gnarf> images.eq(2) would be the 3rd image
[18:58:39] <gnarf> each is much like a for loop, you get and index and element for each
[19:01:13] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: i have https://bpaste.net/show/5456e42cf468
[19:01:40] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: i want to loop through the images and captions
[19:01:44] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: you probably want to only find images rendered in your template?
[19:01:47] <gnarf> not all images?
[19:01:53] <tejas-manohar> nah
[19:01:57] <tejas-manohar> tested it
[19:02:05] <tejas-manohar> this is a dummy thing
[19:02:14] <tejas-manohar> dont need to be safe or cautious LOL
[19:02:34] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: either way, im gonna have to bow out here - got a few very important fires burning today
[19:03:16] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: i want to append first img with <figcaption>[...first string in captions...]</figcaption> and then the second img with <figcaption>[...second string in captions...]</figcaption> and so on
[19:03:32] <tejas-manohar> my application ensures there;'s a 1;1 ratio between captions and images so no need to worry about that
[19:03:47] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: oh ok
[19:03:58] <tejas-manohar> anyone else used .each and done a lot of inner looping?
[19:05:32] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: I can probably help.
[19:05:59] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell:https://bpaste.net/show/5456e42cf468
[19:06:20] <tejas-manohar> i want to append first img with <figcaption>[...first string in captions...]</figcaption> and then the second img with <figcaption>[...second string in captions...]</figcaption> and so on with some sort of loop
[19:06:26] <tejas-manohar> my application ensures there;'s a 1;1 ratio between captions and images so no need to worry about that
[19:06:58] <tejas-manohar> gnarf said images.eq(2) would be the 3rd image if i did images = $('img')
[19:07:05] <tejas-manohar> but im using .each and have i passed in anyways
[19:07:12] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell: advice on how to actually do this?
[19:08:02] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: So you want to loop through each image and wrap it in a figcaption?
[19:09:44] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell:https://bpaste.net/show/fda5e6c3d0c8
[19:10:23] <tejas-manohar> BillCrisweel: I wanna add the figcaption with the string in captions[] that has the same index # as the img under each <img>
[19:12:04] <tejas-manohar> BillCrisweel: does that make sense?
[19:12:17] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: YEah.
[19:13:30] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: You can do like $('img').after(function (i) { return '<figcaption>' + captions[i] + '</figcaption>'; });
[19:16:26] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: Maybe? Been kind of drinkin.
[19:16:28] <BillCriswell> should be close.
[19:16:53] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell: can you send me a paste from mine
[19:16:53] <tejas-manohar> sorry
[19:16:59] <tejas-manohar> its just really hard to read that especially for beginner
[19:17:57] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell: https://bpaste.net/show/fd6c9cf22c1e is my js i had
[19:19:45] <gnarf> BillCriswell: not sure after takes a functional param
[19:19:55] <gnarf> but i kinda hope it does
[19:19:58] <gnarf> seeing that sexy line of code
[19:20:34] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: what exactly does that mean?
[19:20:41] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: http://jsbin.com/bubiyumeloqa/1/edit?html,js,output
[19:20:41] <tejas-manohar> BillCriswell: you still there?
[19:20:44] <tejas-manohar> thanks
[19:20:45] <tejas-manohar> lemme see
[19:20:48] <BillCriswell> gnarf: IT does.
[19:21:02] <gnarf> $('img').each(function(i) { $(this).after( $('<figcaption>').text(captions[i]) ) ); });
[19:21:27] <gnarf> vs $('img').after(function(i) { return $('<figcaption>').text(captions[i]); });
[19:22:05] <gnarf> ^^ or use .html or just the string if you specifically don't want to escape the captions
[19:22:22] <gnarf> i.e. do you allow '<strong>in the caption</strong>'
[19:22:33] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/bubiyumeloqa/2/edit weee
[19:23:05] <gnarf> BillCriswell: damn, thats hot
[19:23:16] <BillCriswell> some sexy ass jquerying
[19:23:37] <gnarf> BillCriswelll: not often i learn about an api signature ;)
[19:24:18] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Honestly wasn't even aware it's called that.
[19:24:22] <BillCriswell> haha
[19:24:48] <gnarf> .after( function ) as opposed to .after( html or jquery object )
[19:25:07] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhh
[19:25:19] <BillCriswell> My vocabulary is terrible.
[19:26:01] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: it fucking works wow
[19:27:08] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: so it works, because when you pass a function to after, it internally does the each and takes what you return to append
[19:27:19] <gnarf> so like
[19:27:23] <gnarf> $('img').each(function(i) { $(this).after( $('<figcaption>').text(captions[i]) ) ); });
[19:27:27] <gnarf> vs $('img').after(function(i) { return $('<figcaption>').text(captions[i]); });
[19:28:00] <gnarf> after does the each internally calling your function
[19:28:56] <gnarf> BillCriswell wow
[19:29:06] <gnarf> BillCriswell that signature is all over the place
[19:29:32] <gnarf> tejas-manohar: http://api.jquery.com/after/#after-function
[19:29:40] <BillCriswell> I now understand what that means haha
[19:29:51] <tejas-manohar> gnarf: looked it up right after i got it :P
[19:31:08] <gnarf> BillCriswell: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L326-L358
[19:31:12] <gnarf> lol domManip
[19:31:15] <gnarf> that thing is a nightmare
[19:33:30] <BillCriswell> That does look tricky.
[19:36:02] <gnarf> BillCriswell: heh
[19:36:03] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L558-L583
[19:36:12] <gnarf> look at the reverses of the previous ones
[19:36:14] <gnarf> thats clever
[19:36:40] <gnarf> though it doesn't seem to work with the functional signature
[19:37:21] <jdewald> that's cool stuff
[19:39:11] <gnarf> glad to see that most of effects.js still looks like my work ;)
[19:39:32] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Hahaha nice.
[19:39:50] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/58ed62ed12cb48d9224f699e86e197804ca5ece4
[19:41:12] <gnarf> fixed like 10 bugs with like 3 more lines of code :)
[19:41:39] <gnarf> 618 additions and 546 deletions. -- +65/-4 lines in tests
[19:41:46] <BillCriswell> Hell of a commit haha.
[20:44:34] <Kurion> hi, for keypress() does a mouse click count as a key press?
[20:47:25] <__joshua__> no
[20:52:20] <Kurion> hi guys, if someone could help with this bug I'd be eternally grateful http://jsbin.com/vovusovabuye/2/edit
[20:52:55] <Kurion> The issue is for some reason, the first keypress causes an empty string to be sent to convertLetter
[20:53:09] <Kurion> So there's always a one key press delay whenever you enter a letter
[20:53:54] <Kurion> Err I mean, there's always an empty string for credit hours, convertLetter works fine
[21:11:51] <Kurion> I found out the issue...it's because it's getting the val of before the press
[21:12:43] <madk> Hey guys how would I go about setting things up so I can make a script or whatever in sublime, then run it in Firefox?
[21:12:55] <madk> I really have no idea what I'm doing so sorry if this question doesn't make much sense.
[23:21:45] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/4v39xa9d/ <--- what am I doing wrong here? also, is it jsfiddle's behaviour to add a <tbody> or is it general behaviour?
[23:24:18] <Cork> Kartagis: that code makes no sense
[23:24:25] <Cork> you create 4 tr
[23:24:30] <Cork> and then you only want one td?
[23:24:52] <Kartagis> Cork: I'll get to that td thing
[23:25:15] <Kartagis> now, I'm interested in why it doesn't create 5 trs
[23:27:42] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/4v39xa9d/1/
[23:28:03] <Cork> Kartagis: cause where still doing the same mistake i talked about with you yesterday
[23:28:09] <Cork> append doesn't clone elements
[23:28:19] <Cork> you need to create a unique one every time you want a new element
[23:28:46] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:28:56] <Kartagis> I need to set a buffer var,
[23:29:02] <Cork> Kartagis: and yes in dom a table holds thead, tbody or tfoot
[23:29:08] <Cork> only html allow you to skip that
[23:29:15] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:29:19] <Kartagis> good to know
[23:29:22] <Cork> Kartagis: no you need to create a dom element for every element you want
[23:29:22] <Kartagis> thanks
[23:29:33] <Cork> you created one tr and one td
[23:29:40] <Cork> so you couldn't ever get more then one of those
[23:29:49] <Cork> i changed it to hold a string instead
[23:30:03] <Cork> and then parse that string to dom element on every append
[23:30:18] <Cork> (internally jquery does the document.createElement on each append here)
[23:31:21] <Cork> Kartagis: to be clear dom is NOT html
[23:31:37] <Cork> Kartagis: html is an xml like markup that a parser converts to a dom tree structure
[23:31:45] <Cork> the dom tree is much more strict then html is
[23:34:37] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:35:32] <Kartagis> what's the difference between table.delegate('td', 'mouseenter'... and td.mouseover(... ?
[23:35:59] <Cork> Kartagis: the later one has to add one event listener to every td in the table
[23:36:05] <Cork> the former adds one to the table
[23:36:10] <Cork> and handle all the td from there
[23:36:14] <Kartagis> hence faster
[23:36:26] <Cork> well that
[23:36:31] <Kartagis> fun
[23:36:37] <Cork> and it keeps working on new td added to the table
[23:36:49] <Cork> while the .mouseover only works on ones added before it was bound
[23:36:54] <Kartagis> is there a jquery book you can recommend? preferably online
[23:36:58] <Cork> i also switched to mouseenter
[23:37:12] <Cork> as mouseover will fire mouseout if you hover over another element inside the td
[23:37:19] <Cork> like a <a> tag or similar
[23:37:30] <Cork> Kartagis: there are tons of tutorials
[23:37:37] <Cork> ?g learn jquery
[23:37:39] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/
[23:37:41] <Cork> for example
[23:38:01] <Kartagis> best resource is from the source
[23:38:04] <Cork> Kartagis: stay away from w3schools though
[23:38:15] <Cork> only strong suggestion i have
[23:38:23] <Kartagis> yea, I know about w3fools
[23:38:25] <Kartagis> :D
[23:38:29] <Cork> good
[23:39:09] <Kartagis> but the weird thing is, they are the first hit to come up when I search for something, anything
[23:39:28] <Cork> ya
[23:39:33] <Cork> they have existed for a LONG time
[23:39:46] <Cork> and existed for long != good
[23:40:01] <Cork> google should learn about that
[23:44:33] <noaXess> morning
[23:45:01] <noaXess> playing around with jqueryui draggable.. is there a way that i only can drag the li element on eg. top/right corner?
[23:45:31] <noaXess> default behavior is to start drag at each position of the li element
[23:45:34] <Cork> noaXess: add an element inside it
[23:45:41] <Cork> noaXess: and then make it the handle
[23:45:54] <noaXess> okey..
[23:45:56] <Cork> then put the handle where you want to be able to drag the li
[23:46:06] <noaXess> Cork: any examle?
[23:46:17] <Cork> as long as it matches the handle selector
[23:46:19] <noaXess> ok will search for that.. try out
[23:46:37] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-handle
[23:46:56] <noaXess> aha ;) thanks.
[23:48:24] <Paradisee> hello :D
[23:57:26] <noaXess> Cork: great.. it works ;)
[23:57:44] <noaXess> but now.. content inside the draggable element isn't selectable..
[23:57:59] <noaXess> so if draggable is active, i can't eg. copy paste content from the element it self..
[23:58:04] <noaXess> is that normal behavior?
[23:58:36] <Cork> hmm not sure, i don't think so
[23:58:55] <Cork> haven't used draggable for quite a while
