[05:32:10] <IHasFingers> hi guys, I have an html element which doesnt existing yet but is added via jquery. I am using this $('#form').find('.next').addClass('hide'); in  function which gets calls very ajax success callback. However that next button does not get hidden. What method can I use which will run at the time it is called to check if the element does exist? Thank you
[05:42:40] <Cork> IHasFingers: $('#form .next').length
[05:42:58] <Cork> or explicitly $('#form .next').length > 0
[05:43:25] <Cork> there is no point in $('#form').find('.next') btw
[05:43:31] <Cork> just merg it into one query
[05:43:49] <IHasFingers> Cork, what is the next button is hidden?
[05:44:10] <Cork> that check does only care if the element exists
[05:44:23] <Cork> setting the class multiple times doesn't matter so that should be all you care about
[05:44:54] <Cork> but ya if $('#form .next').length > 0 you can check $('#form .next.hide').length
[05:48:46] <IHasFingers> Cork, thank you, let me try this
[05:54:38] <IHasFingers> Cork, the buttons get added liek this.  $('#claimformbuttons').append('<button type="button" class="next">Next</button>');
[05:54:55] <IHasFingers> however  $('.next').on('click', function () { doesnt pick it up
[05:55:05] <Cork> uh...
[05:55:16] <Cork> that isn't at all what you asked about...
[05:55:34] <Cork> and $('').on('event', func) doesn't pick up anything
[05:55:39] <Cork> it just binds to what exists now
[05:56:05] <Cork> (as it adds the event handler directly to the targets found)
[05:56:29] <IHasFingers> what if it doesnt exist now but gets added in the future via something like append
[05:56:55] <Uhkis> how about: stop the guess work and make a fiddle
[05:56:59] <Cork> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[05:57:21] <IHasFingers> because if i added the next button in the element and hide it. and I use $('#form .next').length this will also be one same with $('#form .next .hide').length
[06:03:51] <IHasFingers> is they a website I can use purely so i can get my pasted json code back if i make a call to it via ajax?
[06:16:40] <IHasFingers> Uhkis and Cork https://jsfiddle.net/IHasFinger/jxg9dvec/11/ please read the commend in the js part
[06:17:00] <IHasFingers> do bear with me as I am not a front end dev only do backend php and c#
[06:17:44] <IHasFingers> I will give you the context so it can maybe help you understand what I am doing
[06:19:23] <IHasFingers> Basically we are building a survey form, the form question is display 1 by 1 and when you click on next button it will save it in the backend and then get the next question. If you see the previous button you can click it and it take to you to the previous question. If you see the submit button, you are at the end of the survey.
[06:20:08] <IHasFingers> You can only see the previous button, if they was a previous question. When you are on the last question and you see the submit button, you should not see the next button because thats the last question
[06:20:40] <IHasFingers> that is the part I am trying to do in jquery the logic of when to show the buttons
[06:47:40] <Cork> IHasFingers: jsfiddle has a ajax bouncer api
[06:48:00] <Cork> https://docs.jsfiddle.net/async-requests
[06:56:50] <IHasFingers> Cork, thanks again
[06:57:07] <IHasFingers> does my explaination above make sense and also my comments?
[06:57:31] <Cork> well the selector you use is not for what you shared before
[06:57:58] <Cork> $('#form').find('.next').addClass('hide') is not $('#form .next .hide') its $('#form .next.hide')
[07:00:00] <Cork> the event handler shouldn't depend on the state of the button at all, just bind the handler and set disabled on the button when you hide it
[07:14:26] <IHasFingers> Cork, in your last message by disabled do you mean instead of removing the hide class, you are suggestion just disabling the button instead?
[07:17:47] <Cork> IHasFingers: no i meant <button class="hide" disabled>
[07:18:35] <Cork> then you can just check if the button is disabled and don't do the click handling
[07:19:26] <Cork> alternatively (and prob what i would recommend) is to bind the handle on the form and do form.on('click', '.next:not(.hide),.prev:not(.hide)', function() {})
[07:19:44] <Cork> and prevent the click handler for triggering for disabled buttons all together (and only have to caring for one handler
[07:19:58] <Cork> then you can just do if($(this).hasClass('next')
[07:20:07] <Cork> ) {} else {}
[07:20:31] <Cork> cause what js does should be fairly similar for those two actions
[07:21:18] <IHasFingers> Cork, thats an amazing suggestion with form.on('click', '.next:not(.hide),.prev:not(.hide)', function() {}) i will never have thought of that. Will give that a try thanks again
[09:13:28] <IHasFingers> Cork, the above doesnt work for me but works in jsfiddle not sure if its a firefox or brave issue
[09:13:29] <IHasFingers>   $('form#surveyform').on('click', '.next:not(.hide),.prev:not(.hide)', function() {  alert('fsffsdf');});
[09:13:58] <Cork> $('form#surveyform') <-- this is just silly, your making your selector slower by prefixing the id with a tag selector
[09:14:25] <Cork> does the form exist when the handler is created?
[09:14:46] <IHasFingers> Cork, even  $('#surveyform')
[09:14:58] <Cork> if you run console.log($('#surveyform').length) just before the .on call does it report > 0 ?
[09:15:04] <Cork> (well exactly 1)
[09:15:59] <IHasFingers> it returns 1
[09:16:21] <jak2000> hi all
[09:17:14] <jak2000> i have displayed a image base64, when user click on it, open a new webpage https://jsfiddle.net/e50293wp/  see please   in Chrome not Work, but in Firefox yes, why? how to fix?
[09:17:48] <Cork> IHasFingers: and console.log($('[id="surveyform"]').length)
[09:19:14] <IHasFingers> Cork, not sure why but when i rename the class from .next to .next-button the alert shows up on firefox
[09:19:27] <Cork> IHasFingers: what class?
[09:19:47] <IHasFingers> the next button class
[09:19:53] <IHasFingers> and also used it on js too
[09:20:08] <IHasFingers>  $('#surveyform').on('click', '.next-button:not(.hide),.prev:not(.hide)', function() {  alert('fsffsdf');});
[09:20:10] <IHasFingers> this works
[09:20:16] <Cork> most likely you have another event handler doing return false or stopImidiatePropagation
[09:20:33] <Cork> so the event can't get to you
[09:20:54] <Cork> ah, actually stopPropagation is actually enough
[09:21:30] <Cork> jak2000: chrome most likely just don't like data uris in links
[09:21:50] <jak2000> any idea?
[09:22:02] <Cork> what is your gole?
[09:22:04] <jak2000> i want display actualsize.... of the image (i displayed small
[09:22:11] <Cork> hmm
[09:22:21] <Cork> you could load it inline in the page i guess
[09:22:43] <jak2000> i displayed small image, but if user click on it, i want display more bigger(actual size)...
[09:22:45] <jak2000> inline?
[09:22:59] <Cork> something like injecting a <img class="fullscreen" src=data-uri>
[09:23:09] <Cork> and making it overlay the entire page
[09:24:57] <jak2000> something: $(document).on("click", ".clImg", function () {
[09:24:57] <jak2000> ?
[09:25:23] <Cork> could work
[09:25:39] <Cork> the interesting part is making the ui element behave correctly
[09:25:49] <jak2000> yes,
[09:26:10] <jak2000> have a link for learn? <Cork> and making it overlay the entire page
[09:27:07] <Cork> you could use something like lightbox or any of the other hundreds of image popup plugins
[09:27:26] <Cork> or just use css and position fixed
[09:27:50] <Cork> depends on what is most important to you, size/complexity and development time
[09:28:40] <undefined_bob> oh btw happy new year, Cork
[09:28:50] <undefined_bob> hope you are alright
[09:29:10] <Cork> ya, i'm fine. and same to you!
[09:29:23] <undefined_bob> thank you :)
[09:33:08] <DaleJ> Morning from Philly everyone!Â  Heres my https://jsfiddle.net/dalejohn33/24u3vxmp/4/ Â making a day planner for school, trying to make the 'save' from drop down save the input text to local storage and also work for all the input boxes, what I have now only works for the top box and I'm not sure why, any help appreciated. thanks!
[09:36:03] <Cork> DaleJ: document.querySelector(".form-control")
[09:36:38] <Cork> querySelector always only returns one element
[09:38:09] <DaleJ> ah crap ok, i feel like I tried different ways of selecting and none of them worked, how can i select all in this case
[09:38:11] <DaleJ> ?
[09:38:44] <Cork> so save should save all forms not just the one related to the save button?
[09:39:54] <DaleJ> no just the one related to button, when the user enters text they should be able to save it on each individual input form, and ideally in the end they should stay on the page when refreshed...
[09:39:57] <Cork> ok firstly i would not recommend having spaces in ids its a pain to escape the space later and queries becomes a pain
[09:40:31] <Cork> so replace ex "task 2" with "task-2" and so on
[09:40:44] <DaleJ> oh ok gotcha one sec, thanks for this!
[09:40:47] <Cork> second add a name to the input field when your att it
[09:40:58] <Cork> prob simplest to give it the same value
[09:41:56] <Cork> DaleJ: and finally i would a look at https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:42:14] <Cork> just wrap everything for the input in a form and use that
[09:42:59] <DaleJ> ok, i fixed the ids, can u further explain ur second suggestion, about giving a name?
[09:43:20] <Cork> <input id="task-1" name="task-1">
[09:43:24] <Cork> inputs should always have a name
[09:43:35] <DaleJ> oh! ok
[09:43:57] <Cork> the name field is what serializeArray will use so it is kind of important
[09:47:50] <DaleJ> whats the best way to add 'name'?
[09:48:52] <Cork> just set it in the html tag
[09:51:39] <DaleJ> ah nvmd i got it!
[09:54:33] <DaleJ> great thanks, looking into serialize
[09:55:15] <Cork> you want serializeArray not serialize
[09:55:37] <Cork> serialize will give you a param formatted string and it is a pain to revert that back to something usable
[09:55:52] <DaleJ> oh ok gotcha, yeah reading the article u sent me
[10:00:33] <DaleJ> so u think i should serializeArray then put that data back into the input box?
[10:01:23] <Cork> json = JSON.stringify($('form').serializeArray()); arr = JSON.parse(json); arr.forEach((task) => {})
[10:01:46] <Cork> the first and second is for into and out from local storage
[10:04:13] <DaleJ> ok i think i understand
[10:11:24] <DaleJ> how do i make it so each input on the grid dropdown option 'save' is active?
[10:18:42] <DaleJ> Cork you still there?
[10:24:23] <Cork> DaleJ: not sure what the question is there
[10:25:55] <DaleJ> hey sorry, when I do the click for the save option of the dropdown, where the query selector is, i need to get it to work for all the input boxes its only working for the first one
[10:26:17] <Cork> DaleJ: that was the form and serializeArray thing
[10:26:33] <Cork> currently your fetching one element with querySelector and its value with .value
[10:26:44] <Cork> that can't ever give you everyting
[10:27:00] <Cork> simplest is to wrap it in a form and serialize that form to get everything
[10:27:42] <DaleJ> ok ok, gotcha, awesome thanks so much!
[10:27:53] <Cork> good luck
[14:54:48] <ddesai29> mgol just asked you a question about jq-ui in one of the PRs
[14:55:39] <robertmaxrees> ddesai29 if you have a queestion, feel free to ask it here :)
[14:55:55] <ddesai29> cool, thought this was dead...
[14:56:28] <ddesai29> asked in #jquery-ui but no one responded there and thought this is not the place for ui...
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> this is a catch-all :)
[14:57:38] <ddesai29> cool, so I saw on github that that there is a milestone for jQuery-ui 1.13 but there wasn't a release date on it... so wanted to know eta on that
[14:58:10] <robertmaxrees> ah, you're wondering about framework development questions.
[14:58:28] <ddesai29> yeah
[14:58:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd just leave that in github then.  they'll respond when they can :)
[14:59:02] <ddesai29> cool
[14:59:03] <ddesai29> thanks
[14:59:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's like calling somebody to see if they got your chat, and the chat is seeing if they got your email :o)
[15:00:25] <ddesai29> haha got it... i asked question and in a few mins he joined, so that's the reason i pinged. :)
