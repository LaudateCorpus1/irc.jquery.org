[00:01:29] <bartjie> Hi there, is there someone here that could maybe assist me quickly with jqueryui?
[00:01:54] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[00:02:02] <bartjie> HI
[00:02:17] <vrlogrs> is there any way to dynamically select a panel from jquery-ui-accordion
[00:02:19] <vrlogrs> ?
[00:03:20] <vrlogrs> i havent been able to find anything ..
[00:03:25] <vrlogrs> seems impossible :S
[00:03:26] <bartjie> Why dont I have the css, js, developent bundle folders when I download a theme????
[00:04:39] <bartjie> When I download a theme and extract it, i only have an external and images folders with a few js and css files.  Why is this???
[00:05:18] <vrlogrs> im off for the night .. ill check back tomorrow - in case someone has an answer
[00:05:18] <vrlogrs> gn
[00:06:16] <bartjie> How can i get help with my problem.
[00:07:15] <damarusama> I have a function .fullpage that is loaded with some base setting. I can run a function setAutoScrolling(false) from within that function
[00:07:29] <damarusama> how can I call that setAutoScrolling from another function?
[00:21:45] <Silox|> Hello there! If I have 2 onclick listeners for a <a href> object, which both call .preventDefault, will one prevents the other or will they both run (in a race condition)?
[00:24:45] <Cork> Silox|: by onclick do you mean an attribute or an event listener?
[00:25:07] <Cork> as in do you mean onclick or a click event listener?
[00:25:26] <Silox|> .on('click', function...)
[00:26:10] <Cork> then yes all will be called
[00:26:18] <Cork> but not in a race condition
[00:26:21] <Silox|> In a race condition, right? :)
[00:26:23] <Silox|> Oh :o
[00:26:30] <Cork> they are called in a fifo order
[00:26:46] <Cork> executed one at a time (as js is single threaded)
[00:35:19] <sammych> just discovered input:invalid. Bloody. Awesome.
[00:35:44] <Silox|> Cork: and how are they put in the function execution queue?
[00:36:20] <Cork> Silox|: it isn't really execution queue
[00:36:22] <sammych> probably in the order you applied the handlers
[00:36:34] <Cork> it is the browsers list of event handlers
[00:36:41] <Cork> and it just calls them one after the other
[00:36:46] <Silox|> Ah
[00:37:04] <Silox|> so defining 2 handlers after eachother does not specifiy the order where they are executed in?
[00:37:34] <sammych> why don't you test this in a fiddle?
[00:37:39] <sammych> it'd be the most trivial test
[00:38:20] <Silox|> sammych: I can execute it 100 times with the expected result, that still doesn't guarantee that they are cases in which the methods get executed in a different order, no?
[00:38:41] <sammych> debugger;
[00:39:24] <sammych> single threaded would make it more trivial
[00:41:56] <kpap> sgub: http://httpd.apache.org/support.html
[00:43:02] <Silox|> Ah: http://stackoverflow.com/a/282271
[00:45:48] <Cork> Silox|: they do
[00:46:07] <Cork> .on('click', fun1).on('click', fun2)
[00:46:20] <Cork> will always execute fun1 and then fun2
[00:46:28] <Cork> unless the first one does return false
[00:46:53] <Silox|> Yeah, I can see why if you chain them, but what if they are defined in different files?
[00:47:27] <Silox|> (Context: I'm trying to fix some AJAX-y things from module incompabilities in Django, so I prefer not to edit the base Javascript)
[00:47:49] <MathewH> hi, i’m wondering what the difference is between $(document).ready(function() … and $(function() { … They both work but I don’t understand what the latter one does exactly … i always though i had to use document.ready ?
[00:49:24] <Silox|> MathewH: From the docs: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[00:49:37] <Silox|> / Shorthand for $( document ).ready()
[00:49:37] <Silox|> $(function() {
[00:53:24] <MathewH> Silox|: right thx :)
[00:58:38] <BinaryKitten> also, Silox|  for safety's sake   use jQuery(function($) { /** your code here with $ **/ });
[01:21:15] <beasty> morning!
[01:23:13] <shafox> While scrolling I cant seem to add another class to the tag, http://emberjs.jsbin.com/qowiw/1/edit
[01:24:39] <wa5ted> shafox: tag to what
[01:24:50] <abishek> I am trying to find a way to get the number of colors on an image using javascript/jquery. could someone advice on how can this be done?
[01:25:28] <shafox> wa5ted: The div element with class name sticky-nav
[01:25:31] <wa5ted> abishek: perhaps a starting point http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1041399/how-to-use-javascript-or-jquery-to-read-a-pixel-of-an-image
[01:26:13] <wa5ted> shafox: see if you can do a jquery event
[01:27:02] <shafox> wa5ted: I am getting the values that distance is measured but the if block never executed.
[01:27:21] <wa5ted> again
[01:27:24] <wa5ted> write some console.logs
[01:27:27] <wa5ted> to see if its entered
[01:27:34] <wa5ted> maybe your if statement is whack
[01:29:07] <wa5ted> shafox: you want it to stick at 75 px right?
[01:29:22] <wa5ted> and as you scroll for it to continue to stick
[01:29:26] <wa5ted> right?
[01:29:44] <delboy1978uk> i have a 'check all' checkbox for all my other checkboxes. $('input#checkall').click(function(){    if($(this).is(':checked'))    This seems to be the opposite way around though
[01:29:47] <shafox> wa5ted: One more question to ask: What should be the condition, I tried with the $(':header').offset().top - $(window).scrollTop() , but all I want to do is when the header element hit the top = 0 I want a class name stuck to be inserted into the div.sticky-nav
[01:29:55] <delboy1978uk> everything starts out checked
[01:29:56] <shafox> wa5ted: yes
[01:29:59] <wa5ted> shafox: here is your problem
[01:30:06] <wa5ted> you are fixing it at 75 px *only*
[01:30:07] <delboy1978uk> so i expected to uncheck the checkall box
[01:30:18] <wa5ted> you need it fixed for any pixel amount 75 or *above*
[01:30:22] <Cork> delboy1978uk: 1. don't use element names infront of ids, 2. use this.checked
[01:30:33] <delboy1978uk> and for the rest to uncheck, but it seems to be the opposite way ariound, am i missing something?
[01:30:42] <Cork> and note that click happens BEFORE the element changes state
[01:30:50] <wa5ted> shafox: that should solve your issue
[01:30:56] <wa5ted> just use  a >= 75px
[01:31:01] <shafox> wa5ted: Let me try that.
[01:31:03] <wa5ted> instead of ====
[01:31:08] <wa5ted> ===*
[01:31:10] <wa5ted> it should work
[01:31:20] <shafox> yes wa5ted Trying that now.
[01:31:35] * wa5ted crosses his fingers
[01:31:42] <delboy1978uk> so like this then? $('#checkall').click(function(){
[01:32:03] <delboy1978uk> if($(this).checked())
[01:32:32] <wa5ted> damn that didnt work
[01:32:44] <delboy1978uk> hmm that does nothing now lol
[01:33:11] <wa5ted> delboy1978uk: here is an idea, just check all of them
[01:33:18] <wa5ted> dont need to check with if statement
[01:33:20] <Cork> delboy1978uk: no just this.checked
[01:33:22] <Cork> no $()
[01:33:25] <shafox> nope that didnt work. It worked the other way . wa5ted
[01:34:00] <wa5ted> shafox: ?
[01:34:07] <wa5ted> yeah sorry my bad
[01:34:19] <Cork> delboy1978uk: $('#checkall').click(function(){ if(this.checked) { /* Was checked */ } else { /* Wasn't checked */ } });
[01:34:22] <shafox> wa5ted: Trying to work it out.
[01:34:32] <wa5ted> shafox: can you update so i can see
[01:34:42] <shafox> wa5ted: Yes gimme a sec
[01:34:52] <wa5ted> shafox: nvm i cloned it
[01:35:29] <delboy1978uk> ok this.checked wiorks, but  i still need to put ! in front as it seems the opposite way around!
[01:36:11] <Cork> hmm
[01:36:12] <shafox> wa5ted: http://emberjs.jsbin.com/qowiw/1  : Thank you.
[01:36:18] <Cork> delboy1978uk: my statement about checked was wrong
[01:36:22] <delboy1978uk> sctually that makes sense i'm talking rubbish
[01:36:26] <Cork> delboy1978uk: http://jsfiddle.net/un3e1tnk/ this one works just fine for me
[01:36:40] <wa5ted> shafox: did i solve it or what?
[01:37:31] <wa5ted> shafox: nvm yes i did, btw your links in your header bar should not go outside of the container
[01:37:31] <shafox> wa5ted: Well you fixed the comparison , I just modified that to >= to <=
[01:37:34] <wa5ted> if you program them right
[01:37:41] <wa5ted> yeah
[01:38:03] <delboy1978uk> thanks for the help guys
[01:38:25] <wa5ted> abishek: did my stuff help
[01:39:33] <abishek> wa5ted, still trying to understand how to use it, I will have to for-loop each pixel on the image to get the color, but what if the colors are close enough, should i take them as 2 different colors and how should i be doing that
[01:40:01] <wa5ted> abishek: thats up to you, by definition they are two seperate colors
[01:40:17] <wa5ted> you would need a a nested while loop
[01:40:24] <wa5ted> one to traverse length wise
[01:40:28] <wa5ted> antoher along the height
[01:40:49] <wa5ted> abishek: as for storing the colors use an array of rgba values i suppose
[01:40:57] <wa5ted> read the documention on how to read the colors
[01:41:12] <abishek> yes, i understand that part. the only thing is to be able to ignore close colors and get the exact numbers
[01:41:45] <wa5ted> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/9SEMf/869/
[01:41:48] <wa5ted> this might help
[01:41:59] <wa5ted> ignore is up to you
[01:42:07] <wa5ted> again you ahve to understand how rgb work
[01:42:09] <wa5ted> works
[01:44:23] <abishek> wa5ted, the jsfiddle don't seem to work, but i get the point
[01:44:43] <wa5ted> it will grab the color you need
[01:44:55] <wa5ted> again you must traverse the image length and height wise
[01:44:59] <wa5ted> and then determine close colors
[01:45:25] <abishek> ok, trying to figure out how to do that
[02:03:23] <SwashBuckla> is there a way of chaining selectors so that I can traverse a tree of tags in one selector? something like $("div:first,tr:last").css({...}); to achieve 1) Go inside first <div> 2) inside that, go inside last table row
[02:04:32] <Deele> sure, just seperate them with spaces
[02:04:57] <Deele> $('div:first tr:last')
[02:05:21] <SwashBuckla> so that goes inside the child of div:first to find the last tr?
[02:05:41] <Cork> SwashBuckla: yes, it works just like css selectors normally work
[02:05:59] <Cork> except it extends it with :first and :last
[02:07:12] <SwashBuckla> hmm
[02:08:01] <SwashBuckla> I'm thinking that I need to use $("div:first").children("tr:last").css({...})
[02:10:48] <Cork> SwashBuckla: no
[02:10:59] <Cork> $("div:first").children("tr:last") is the same as $("div:first > tr:last")
[02:11:17] <Cork> $("div:first").find("tr:last") is the same as $("div:first tr:last")
[02:13:39] <SwashBuckla> ok
[02:13:57] <SwashBuckla> what is the first example doing?
[02:14:08] <SwashBuckla> ... > ...
[02:17:00] <Cork> ?g mdn css selectors

[02:48:54] <Donguston> I have this object http://pastebin.com/mWEWJ8Jn but I have no idea how to get its fields. Ive never used jquery before.
[02:49:16] <Donguston> Ive tried bike.model and bike[model]
[02:49:18] <Donguston> neither work ;(
[02:50:17] <Donguston> do I need to make a class and use that?
[02:54:05] <Cork> Donguston: that is just an object, it has nothing to do with jquery
[02:54:15] <Cork> just do <variable>,.model
[02:54:17] <Cork> opps
[02:54:21] <Cork> *<variable>.model
[02:55:20] <Cork> Donguston: http://jsfiddle.net/7f4xm34q/

[03:43:17] <Mosselmaniac> super strange. i'm using 'on' to have  'live binding' but the click-event is not fired.
[03:43:59] <wa5ted> Mosselmaniac: why not do .on("click"
[03:44:01] <wa5ted> directly
[03:44:50] <Mosselmaniac> I've got this: $('.place_order').on("click", function (ev) {
[03:44:55] <Mosselmaniac> which is not fired....
[03:46:55] <Cork> k4r1m: so .replace(/:\n/m, ': ')
[03:47:00] <Cork> *K4T:
[03:47:10] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: that isn't a live binding
[03:47:43] <Cork> live would be something like $('.a_parent').on('click', '.place_order', function(ev) {});
[03:47:59] <K4T> Cork: I have to remove new line only after @SOMETEXT: pattern
[03:48:39] <Mosselmaniac> yeah got it thx cork
[03:49:19] <K4T> those texts after @SOMETEXT: pattern can have new lines which I do not want to remove
[03:50:28] <Cork> K4T: so .replace(/(@[^:]+:)\n/, '$1 ')
[03:50:59] <Cork> js> print('@damian:\n@damian2:\n@damian3: hi guys!\n@damian4: bla bla!'.replace(/(@[^:]+:)\n/g, '$1 '))

[04:14:59] <K4T> how can I check that submit event is already bound to form?
[04:22:28] <Cork> K4T: you can't
[04:22:36] <Cork> K4T: and you shouldn't have to
[04:22:58] <Cork> K4T: if you need to dynamically have the event handler for forms, use a delegated event listener
[04:23:28] <Cork> $('.stable_always_pressent_parent').on('submit', 'form', function(e) {})
[04:24:49] <wa5ted> Cork: why you beat me to answer XD
[04:25:01] <Cork> wa5ted: habit :)

[04:25:29] <K4T> thx
[05:13:07] <clarkk> I'm using the jquery Waypoints Sticky Elements library, which adds an element with class "sticky-elements" to the page on load. http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/   When I do $('.sticky-elements').height() further down in my script, it returns null.
[05:13:08] <clarkk> Does anyone know why this is, please?
[05:15:27] <clarkk> I suppose a simpler way of asking is, if you add an element to the page using jquery, should you be able to get the computed height of that element, using $('.myelement').height() ?
[05:17:30] <xilyin> clarkk, it doesn't look like it adds the sticky-elements class. I tried it on the page you linked, had to use the class they were using, $('.my-sticky-element').height() returns 36
[05:18:19] <clarkk> xilyin: the default is sticky-wrapper
[05:18:45] <clarkk> xilyin: actually, I think I've just worked it out - I should be using css('height')
[05:18:49] <djam90> How can I unbind an event listener? So for example I have element.on("click",function....)   How can I destroy this
[05:19:39] <xilyin> djam90, http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[05:20:14] <xilyin> clarkk, great.
[05:20:30] <djam90> So can I just el.unbind("click");
[05:20:52] <m1su> you should use .off() with newer versions
[05:20:58] <m1su> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[05:22:34] <djam90> m1su, why .off vs .unbind?
[05:22:45] <Cork> djam90: bind > unbind
[05:22:49] <Cork> delegate > undelegate
[05:22:52] <Cork> on > off
[05:23:23] <Cork> djam90: so there isn't a technical reason
[05:23:29] <Cork> just consistency
[05:28:48] <aways> Hey. It's possible with jquery mobile to use pagecontainer to change page and reload it
[05:29:19] <aways> because {reload: true} has no effect on the JS
[05:29:42] <aways> The DOM is reload but not the JS process
[05:41:09] <anli> If I have a string with option tags, a select.html(thestring) will replace the option tags, right?
[05:43:02] <Cork> anli: yes
[06:03:24] <Hyperking> when connecting to a json file using getJSON() method, is the resource downloaded to the client? or does it act similar to a REST service?
[06:07:22] <anli> Cork: As I thought, no magic involved
[06:07:50] <Cork> Hyperking: http doesn't have files
[06:07:57] <Cork> anli: sorry?
[06:08:05] <Cork> Hyperking: http has services and resources
[06:08:26] <anli> Cork: A reply to your answer
[06:08:32] <Cork> if you get a file client side it just means the client choosed to store the resource on disk
[06:08:44] <Cork> ah
[06:08:50] <Cork> anli: whats magic about that?
[06:09:03] <anli> There was no magic involved
[06:09:11] <Cork> ...
[06:09:14] * Cork wacks on head
[06:09:19] <anli> Which would be the case if .html did not replace the options
[06:09:21] <Cork> magic != no magic...
[06:09:28] <Cork> sorry about that :/
[06:09:31] <anli> :)
[06:09:50] <Hyperking> Cork: resource meaning a json file  $.getJSON('data.json',...)
[06:10:00] <Cork> Hyperking: no reasource meaning the url
[06:10:07] <Cork> like i said http doesn't have files
[06:10:15] <Cork> the server might have the data it sends stored in files
[06:10:20] <Cork> but http doesn't have files
[06:11:08] <Cork> Hyperking: $.getJSON('data.json',...) sends a request to the server the page was loaded from, to the same path the page was loaded from
[06:11:25] <Cork> and asks the webserver to send the data the url points to
[06:11:38] <Cork> the server sends the data stream with a header telling what type of data it is
[06:11:44] <Cork> nothing else
[06:12:21] <Cork> the server side is the server gets and url and converts it to either pointing to a script, or a function or a resource
[06:12:24] <Cork> or a different server
[06:12:34] <Cork> or... a path on the local file system pointing to a file
[06:12:51] <Cork> executes the file if that is needed and returns the result or the files content
[06:13:06] <Hyperking> Ok, Perfect! my concern was wether the 100k json file will be downloaded to the client every time it's accessed.
[06:13:09] <Cork> but again the http protocol doens't care what source the server has for the data
[06:13:26] <Cork> Hyperking: that depends on the clients cache settings
[06:13:34] <Cork> and if the server sends a cache: no-cache header
[06:15:38] <Hyperking> right. no caching for that particular file. Im working on a static site and using a json file as a flat search db
[06:15:55] <Cork> Hyperking: again what you have server side doesn't matter
[06:16:13] <Cork> normally clients cache all get requests
[06:16:24] <Cork> well at least all browsers
[06:16:33] <Cork> with a limit on how big the cache can be
[06:16:53] <palzie> hello, is there a way to return the classes of an element that has a specific class ? e.g. : <div class="a b active">, I want to get a and b if the div hasClass active
[06:17:09] <Cork> Hyperking: so if you send a getJSON you most likely hit the cache as long as the url doens't change
[06:17:26] <Cork> palzie: this.className
[06:17:33] <Cork> or attr('class')
[06:17:49] <Cork> or in modern browsers
[06:17:52] <Cork> classList
[06:18:38] <palzie> Cork: al ... right
[06:19:24] <Hyperking> Cork: the cache would contain the requests (http://mysite.com/data.json), and not the actual file data.json?
[06:19:45] <Cork> Hyperking: ... again http doesn't have files
[06:20:04] <Cork> you have resources, requests and cached responses
[06:20:21] <Cork> well responses and cached responses
[06:20:35] <lilsammy_> anyone ever hav issues with spaces in Json?
[06:20:38] <lilsammy_> and select boxes
[06:20:40] <lilsammy_> http://pastebin.com/43WygVKa
[06:21:11] <Hyperking> Cork: ok, i was told differently. but I thought that was the case
[06:21:35] <lilsammy_> I output ajax of json result into a select box and the visible text is fine but if a Json value has spaces in it, it messes up the value="" at the spaces adding them as new attributes
[06:21:41] <Cork> lilsammy_: make a console.log(value) in the loop
[06:21:53] <lilsammy_> oh yeah 2 secs
[06:21:54] <Hyperking> Cork: i was told the data.json would be saved to the client much like an image asset would
[06:22:03] <Cork> lilsammy_: cause no that shouldn't be a problem
[06:22:28] <lilsammy_> Yeah the logged values look fine :/
[06:22:29] <Cork> lilsammy_: though if you are scared about that you could do $('<option>', { value: value });
[06:22:41] <Cork> * $('<option>', { value: value, text: value });
[06:22:51] <lilsammy_> think I tried that let me retest
[06:23:00] <Cork> Hyperking: sure, but again that isn't a file
[06:23:17] <lmatteis> hello it seems that jquery is automatically parsing my xml file. is there a way to just obtain the textual representation of the xml?
[06:23:32] <lilsammy_> wait cork your referencing a tag?
[06:23:59] <Cork> lilsammy_: no $('<tag_name>') is a shorthand for $(document.createElement('tag_name'))
[06:24:11] <lilsammy_> ohhhhhh
[06:24:12] <lmatteis> sorry, when ajaxing
[06:24:37] <Cork> lilsammy_: also for performance don't ever ever add elements in a loop to the live tree
[06:24:41] <Cork> it is horribly slow
[06:24:49] <Cork> build an array and then add them all in one go
[06:25:02] <Hyperking> Cork: would a rest endpoint cache as well in the same manner?
[06:25:31] <Cork> lilsammy_: add_comp.push($('<option>', { value: value })[0]) (notice the [0] at the end
[06:25:51] <Cork> and then after the loop do $('#add_comp').append(add_comp);
[06:25:57] <Cork> and add_comp is var add_comp = [];
[06:26:06] <lilsammy_> testing
[06:27:44] <lilsammy_> holy crap how can it still be doing it
[06:27:52] <Cork> Hyperking: only two things matter: 1. the url is identical between calls, 2. the cache hasn't expired, 3. the server responds with "not modified" if the client sends a request
[06:27:54] <lilsammy_> must faster though ><
[06:28:16] <lilsammy_> I don't see how the text if fine but its effecting the value part only :/
[06:28:19] <Cork> Hyperking: what technology is running on the server has absolutely no meaning to the result
[06:28:38] <lilsammy_> I tried escaping the string thinking that was it but it didn't work either.
[06:28:47] <Cork> lilsammy_: if you get it with that new line it isn't from there
[06:28:56] <Cork> cause you can't get the effect if you use value:
[06:29:03] <Cork> lilsammy_: could you try making a fiddle?
[06:29:31] <lilsammy_> could do cork but it wont include some librarys im loading as its coming from a live client portal
[06:29:38] <palzie> is there a way to get the "siblings" classes of an element that has a specific class
[06:29:49] <lilsammy_> making fiddle though see if its going to do it there
[06:29:56] <palzie> <div class="a b c"> "siblings" of a are b and c
[06:30:36] <slax0r> no?
[06:30:39] <Cork> palzie: $.map($(this).siblings('.the-class'), function(e) { return e.className; }).join(' ')
[06:30:49] <Cork> ah
[06:31:00] <slax0r> siblings would be if class b and c would be in their own element on the same level as element with class a
[06:31:13] <palzie> ye thats why i said "siblings" into " "
[06:31:14] <Cork> palzie: you would have to select the elements with the class and ask for the siblings
[06:31:41] <palzie> well i'm not sure i was clear
[06:31:47] <slax0r> palzie: I get it
[06:31:51] <palzie> what i woud like to do is like my example
[06:31:57] <Hyperking> Cork: thanks..understood
[06:32:06] <slax0r> yeah, .attr('class') will return you a full space separated class list
[06:32:21] <slax0r> you could then split it with /\s+/
[06:32:23] <Cork> and classList a collection :)
[06:32:28] <palzie> erm
[06:32:35] <slax0r> Cork: classList exists?
[06:32:35] <palzie> that sounds a little rough to my head
[06:32:41] <Cork> ?g mdn classList
[06:32:43] <b-ot> Cork: element.classList - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.classList
[06:32:51] <slax0r> why do I even bother? :)
[06:33:01] <palzie> is that possible : $(div).hasClass('x')
[06:33:05] <Cork> slax0r: note the ie version limitation though :)
[06:33:11] <palzie> tried with 'div' and div but nothing hapnd
[06:33:17] <slax0r> palzie: yes, it's possible
[06:33:35] <palzie> without quotes o.0 ?
[06:33:48] <slax0r> well, "div" will work, but there are probably quite a few div elements on the page
[06:34:01] <palzie> yeah sure, but only two in my case that has a specific class
[06:34:19] <Cork> palzie: then you want $('div.x')
[06:34:28] <palzie> well
[06:34:41] <palzie> hmm
[06:34:47] <Cork> hasClass returns true/false
[06:34:51] <Cork> not the elements
[06:35:16] <palzie> hmm
[06:35:37] <palzie> may I explain my problem a little clearly
[06:35:40] <palzie> well more in details
[06:35:42] <palzie> but not so far
[06:35:51] <Cork> palzie: you are prob better of making a jsfiddle demo
[06:35:51] <palzie> cause i think i'm not approaching it
[06:35:51] <slax0r> palzie: what exactly do you want to do?
[06:35:54] <palzie> the best way
[06:36:03] <palzie> @Cork well if i could
[06:36:38] <palzie> well, the context is that i have a module on prestashop that displays a slideshow. i want to add a pagination to it
[06:36:56] <palzie> the active slide has a text and an image which both has a class "current"
[06:37:08] <lilsammy_> ok Cork works fine in the fiddle think the page is cacheing or somthing
[06:37:14] <lilsammy_> using codeigniter lememe see
[06:37:20] <palzie> i want to get the divs that has the "current" class so that I can remove it after clicking on the pager thingie
[06:37:36] <lilsammy_> oh ffs ...
[06:37:51] <palzie> but divs are like this : <div class="contenttext current"> and <div class="contentimg current">
[06:38:22] <palzie> and what i intended to do is somethiing like this : if div hasClass current {... }
[06:38:38] <palzie> but I couldn"t manage to get the $("div") ... workign
[06:41:17] <slax0r> palzie: $("div.current").removeClass("current")
[06:41:24] <lilsammy_> Cork save me!
[06:41:26] <lilsammy_> lol
[06:41:37] <slax0r> if you want to remove the class
[06:41:46] <palzie> yeah i know this function
[06:41:49] <palzie> maybe i can dig this
[06:41:55] <Yaazkal> Hi everyone, I'm having issues with an image map plugin. If anyone can check an help me troubleshoot http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25253516/when-using-image-map-with-imagemapster-jquery-plugin-the-coords-are-changed
[06:41:55] <palzie> well ima try
[06:41:57] <palzie> thanks
[06:42:00] <Cork> lilsammy_: if you can't reproduce it in the fiddle and clearing cache doesn't help
[06:42:18] <Cork> lilsammy_: the problem most likely is from a part of your page outside the function your looking at
[06:42:23] <lilsammy_> Cork it works fine in fiddle somthing else seems to do it I think
[06:42:24] <lilsammy_> http://jsfiddle.net/dz0qn8ff/2/
[06:42:31] <slax0r> Cork: haven't seen you around in a while, vacation?
[06:42:45] <Cork> lilsammy_: ya, so start disabling things and see if you can find where it comes from
[06:42:46] <lilsammy_> must be somthing else let me keep digging
[06:42:51] <Cork> slax0r: yup
[06:43:19] <slax0r> nice, enjoying a little sunshine with a beer in your hand? ;)
[06:49:36] <lilsammy_> Can you log array?
[06:53:42] <julle> hey, is there possible to do something like this : var toto = 5; $('.number_"+toto+").each() ...
[06:54:28] <BillCriswell> julle: Yes.
[06:54:40] <julle> BillCriswell: is the way i wrote the good one
[06:54:42] <julle> ?
[06:54:54] <julle> well forgot a ' after the second "
[06:54:56] <BillCriswell> julle: Close, $('.number_' + toto).each()
[06:55:03] <julle> alright
[06:55:06] <julle> thanks BillCriswell
[06:55:12] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:56:13] <lilsammy_> ok Cork got a bit further on
[06:56:42] <lilsammy_> Value displays correctly theres a problem
[06:57:04] <lilsammy_> because I try to set 2 select boxes with the values and only the second of the 2 populates
[06:57:20] <lilsammy_> the first one I try to populate seems to stay empty
[06:57:34] <Cork> lilsammy_: you need to create one element for each select
[06:57:47] <Cork> meaning you need to have an add_comp and an edit_comp variable
[06:57:48] <lilsammy_> oooooooooooh...
[06:57:59] <Cork> elements doesn't clone by them self :)
[06:58:08] <Cork> you just move them if you add them multiple times
[06:59:00] <lilsammy_> Oh thats it working
[06:59:12] <lilsammy_> thats odd why can't an array be used twice?
[06:59:43] <Cork> lilsammy_: the array can, the elements can't
[07:00:05] <Cork> elm1.append() /* element added */ elm2.append() /* elements moved here from elm1 */
[07:00:05] <lilsammy_> But am I not just storing html in an array?
[07:00:13] <lilsammy_> oh
[07:00:20] <Cork> lilsammy_: $('<option>') creates dom elements
[07:00:22] <Cork> not strings
[07:00:35] <lilsammy_> See I didn't realise that, many thanks cork
[07:00:41] <Cork> lilsammy_: an option is to do $(add_comp).clone()
[07:00:50] <Cork> and you can add the clone and everything should work just fine
[07:01:07] <lilsammy_> Thanks cork
[07:01:14] <Cork> np

[07:11:30] <masentinel900> hello
[07:11:55] <masentinel900> guys, someone know some online text editor for include with jquery
[07:12:42] <masentinel900> For example, for to create a message with text editor and send it for email, (Only the text)
[07:13:12] <drej> you're looking for a rich text editor
[07:13:38] <BillCriswell> That's what you got from that? Damn. I was completely lost.
[07:14:24] <masentinel900> http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/
[07:15:25] <masentinel900> a have tested wth that but I can't to get only the text without the tags
[07:15:44] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: Why not just use a plain text editor?
[07:15:49] <BillCriswell> Er, plain textarea*
[07:16:21] <masentinel900> Ok, so what's the best way to create a file online with format
[07:16:23] <masentinel900> ??
[07:17:04] <masentinel900> I need set an area for the user can create an online template for to send via mail
[07:17:51] <BillCriswell> You just said you only want the text.
[07:18:07] <masentinel900> yes
[07:18:37] <masentinel900> What I'm doing is simple, I need to create templates dinamically online
[07:19:03] <masentinel900> so I need a text editor for user can to set how want the mail template
[07:21:05] <BillCriswell> I think I'm missing something here.

[07:29:24] <CaptainMilk> hey guys, i am trying to toggle a class on and off when the <a> tag is clicked, but i can’t get it to function? I am confused as to how i select the right div...
[07:29:25] <CaptainMilk> <a id="button" href="#">Click a few times, toggle me!</a>
[07:29:41] <CaptainMilk> ** www.jsfiddle.net/njd3od81
[07:30:58] <workerbeetwo> Hi. Can I select an element which has no id by a pattern? something like this one '<td> <h3>sometext I want</h3> <td> <div class="canbefound"> </td>'
[07:31:11] <BillCriswell> CaptainMilk: You need to preventDefault() on the event.
[07:31:27] <BillCriswell> Right now the link is just redirecting you.
[07:31:45] <Cork> CaptainMilk: http://jsfiddle.net/njd3od81/1/
[07:32:26] <Cork> CaptainMilk: also don't use broken links
[07:32:39] <Cork> if you use <a> give it a workable link
[07:32:42] <dllama> hey guys, is there a way i can use .map() to not only get keys, but also add values to them?  i'm mapping data attributes on my checkboxes to store the id's in session, but i'm trying ot make the id's keys and value being true for selected
[07:32:48] <Cork> else use <button> and css
[07:33:10] <CaptainMilk> hmm, ok, must need to be a button.
[07:33:52] <BillCriswell> CaptainMilk: http://jsfiddle.net/njd3od81/3/
[07:35:05] <Cork> CaptainMilk: no, not must be, it just shouldn't be a broken link
[07:37:45] <CaptainMilk> ok, can i just put a “#” in it instead?
[07:37:54] <CaptainMilk> instead of turning it into a button
[07:38:07] <CaptainMilk> it’s not going to direct to a different page
[07:38:12] <CaptainMilk> or anywhere else on the page.
[07:47:32] <dllama> can anyone please help me out with mapping all checkboxes and adding true/false for them to be posted as a single array?  right now i'm able to get it to work exactly as needed by first mapping and then doing a forEach() over the returned map, but I'm positive there has to be a way to do it in a single function
[07:49:52] <BillCriswell> dllama: You even want the inputs that aren't checked?
[07:51:10] <dllama> Bill, for me it actually doesn't matter
[07:51:22] <dllama> instead of using the prop(:checked) i'm just calling it by class
[07:51:42] <dllama> becuase i'm setting the id's of the checked/unchecked boxes into session,
[07:51:49] <dllama> and my server side script checks for k/v pairs
[07:52:06] <BillCriswell> dllama: I think you want serializeArray()
[07:52:54] <BillCriswell> If you do like $(':checkbox').serializeArray() that'll give you like [{ name: "checkbox1", value: "foo" }, ... ]
[07:53:59] <dllama> i'm trying to put what i have on jsfiddle
[07:54:02] <dllama> but its being a pain
[07:54:04] <dllama> can i paste code here?
[07:54:07] <dllama> its only a few lines
[07:54:15] <BillCriswell> dllama: jsbin can also work.
[07:54:24] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't post in here. Gets people cranky haha
[07:55:48] <dllama> dammit, same thing on jsbin, i copy/pasted from chrome console (list of checkbox elements) but it keeps adding a bullet to each and screwing with everything
[07:56:09] <dllama> ok, maybe not
[07:56:12] <dllama> pasting link in 1 sec
[07:56:28] <BillCriswell> dllama: That sounds aesthetic. I wouldn't worry about it.
[07:59:00] <dllama> http://jsbin.com/vajijafohito/1/
[07:59:49] <dllama> i'm basically looping over it twice in my case

[08:02:33] <BillCriswell> dllama: And what do you want from this? [ { debitID: true | false }, ... ] ?
[08:02:38] <dllama> yea
[08:03:09] <BillCriswell> true false just means checked or not, right?
[08:03:12] <dllama> i'll be back in 15, need to jump on a call
[08:03:20] <dllama> thank you!
[08:06:04] <BillCriswell> dllama: I think you just want this: dllama: So you cant like: [ { name: "checkbox1", value: "foo"
[08:06:11] <BillCriswell> Er, copy and paste is hard.

[08:11:12] <mdev> "Although COBOL is a verbose language and not always the easiest to use, at least it isn't sh*t-for-brains stupid like JavaScript so often is. When I use JavaScript, I often sit there wondering, "What the f*ck was Eich thinking when he came up with this stupidity?" and then I wonder, "Why the f*ck hasn't the JavaScript community fixed these f*cking stupid misfeatures?""
[08:11:19] <mdev> thoughts on this guys comments?
[08:11:25] <mdev> is js really that weak/broken?
[08:11:27] <dllama> BillCriswell: Thanks!
[08:11:43] <BillCriswell> dllama: No problem.
[08:12:30] <BillCriswell> mdev: I love it, but i might just understand the subtleties of its retardations a bit.
[08:12:59] <mdev> i'm not a callback for everything fan
[08:13:05] <mdev> but seems fine to me besides that
[08:13:34] <mdev> I do wish jquery was more of a framework though
[08:13:37] <mdev> similar to PHP's
[08:13:44] <mdev> having lot of essentials built in
[08:13:52] <BillCriswell> mdev: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript this talk is fun and pokes fun at it a bit.
[08:13:54] <mdev> datetime etc...
[08:14:01] <snover> then you want something like dojo
[08:14:19] <BillCriswell> Though Eich runs through it again in another video and defends some decisions.
[08:14:22] <snover> or mootools, or any of the other libraries that do more than just dom manipulation
[08:16:00] <mdev> why jquery not do thisS?
[08:17:40] <Saaether> if you want to do alot of stuff with datetime just grab momentjs
[08:17:51] <BillCriswell> Mmmmm, moment.js
[08:18:01] <mdev> mmm yet more external js files
[08:18:02] <mdev> :p
[08:18:38] <Saaether> you can put them all in 1 file if that bothers you =P
[08:18:42] <BillCriswell> Not if you combine them all up and put them in one file!
[08:19:01] <mdev> is that allowed?
[08:19:05] <BillCriswell> concat('ooohhhh.js', 'ahhhhh.js')
[08:19:10] <BillCriswell> mdev: of course.
[08:19:13] <Saaether> why wouldnt it be?
[08:19:20] <mdev> doesn't that break some kind of internet rule or something
[08:19:26] <mdev> just mixing files like that
[08:19:46] <BillCriswell> mdev: It's does the same exact thing as including them one by one.
[08:20:03] <mdev> I think mobile fails if js file too big
[08:20:13] <mdev> so not the same
[08:20:20] <BillCriswell> mdev: You can't just say things like that.
[08:20:31] <BillCriswell> Totally the same.
[08:20:33] <mdev> pretty suire it does
[08:20:39] <mdev> so how can it be the same
[08:20:40] <BillCriswell> It's better for mobile, less http requests.
[08:20:52] <mdev> but mobile has file size limit
[08:20:58] <mdev> maybe it's for cache i'm thinking
[08:22:12] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[08:23:13] <Saaether> a bit dated http://www.guypo.com/uncategorized/mobile-browser-cache-sizes-round-2/  but good luck having a JS file to fill a 200MB or 85MB cache

[08:50:36] <sky> huh, just needed brackets around the string. wonder why
[08:50:53] <robertmaxrees> object property access notation.
[08:51:05] <robertmaxrees> object.foo === object['foo']
[08:51:11] <inDux> Hey, started relying on jQuery to create dynamic form elements, but as my app grows in complexity it's becoming harder to maintain
[08:51:33] <robertmaxrees> if you have var aString = 'foo'; you can then do object[aString];
[08:51:40] <inDux> I'm using a Laravel backend, how do you keep jquery code readable? Especially with PHP output
[08:51:52] <robertmaxrees> inDux are you generating js with your backend?
[08:52:21] <inDux> robertmaxrees: not generating but sometimes I output PHP generated strings to jquery
[08:52:29] <inDux> robertmaxrees: because they are dynamic
[08:52:36] <robertmaxrees> can you show us an example of what you're doing?
[08:54:01] <inDux> robertmaxrees: sure, it's like dynamic forms and modals
[08:54:31] <robertmaxrees> the way I'd implement something like that and the way you implement it are going to be different, so some code to illustrate would be helpful.
[08:58:12] <jadew> $("#my-menu").trigger("close.mm"); what exactly does this do internally? what is close.mm and how can I run it with out jquery?
[08:59:02] <robertmaxrees> jadew that triggers that event in the event subsystem for jquery.  if you swap that out for something that doesn't use jquery, you'll need to create a new event listener that doesn't rely on jquery either.
[08:59:52] <jadew> robertmaxrees, well, I figure there has to be a way to get to the close.mm event
[08:59:58] <jadew> it has to be stored somewhere
[09:00:04] <robertmaxrees> jquery events are separate from browser events
[09:00:27] <jadew> yeah, but it's probably in some associative array somewhere
[09:00:44] <jadew> I'm trying to get to it from an iframe (reaching back into the parent code)
[09:00:56] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't have associative arrays ;)
[09:01:01] <jadew> object
[09:01:08] <jadew> but ussed as an assoc array
[09:01:22] <robertmaxrees> heh.  so you're trying to access a parent frame?
[09:01:30] <BillCriswell> Risky move since the order of them can't be guaranteed.
[09:01:32] <jadew> yeah, I want to trigger the close event
[09:01:40] <jadew> BillCriswell, what order?
[09:01:50] <BillCriswell> an object.
[09:02:05] <BillCriswell> I could go for a bagel.
[09:02:26] <robertmaxrees> jadew properties in objects aren't guaranteed to be in any particular order.  arrays, on the other hand have a guaranteed order.
[09:02:38] <jadew> robbyoconnor, what does that have to do with anything?
[09:02:51] <jadew> obj[key] will get you there, no matter the order
[09:03:02] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete, and it may or may not matter depending on how you're using the object.
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> if you want to trigger events on the parent window, check out the window.opener.document object.
[09:04:06] <jadew> :/
[09:04:20] <jadew> parent window uses jquery
[09:04:44] <jadew> I want to trigger an event in the parent window's jquery event table
[09:04:57] <jadew> from a child window which doesn't have jqeury
[09:05:12] <jadew> so I need to reach into the jqeury's core of the parent window and run that function manually
[09:05:15] <robertmaxrees> then you're SOL.  you're not going to be able to get access to the "jquery event table"
[09:05:26] <jadew> for that I kinda need to know what trigger() does internally
[09:05:33] <robertmaxrees> welcome to scoping.
[09:05:38] <jadew> robertmaxrees, why not? it's just js
[09:06:01] <robertmaxrees> iirc that data is all scoped to the jquery closure - you don't have access to it.
[09:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you COULD access the parent window's copy of jquery and use that to trigger though.
[09:06:44] <jadew> if $(whatever).whatever() has access to it, I should be able to access it too
[09:06:54] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't work that way ;)
[09:07:19] <jadew> ok, let's get something straight, I know JS
[09:07:41] <robertmaxrees> you could try something like window.opener.document.$('element').trigger('event') <- something like this could work.
[09:08:08] <jadew> wouldn't $ be part of the window?
[09:08:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:08:51] <jadew> ?
[09:10:06] <robertmaxrees> then target the parent window object.
[09:10:44] <jadew> yeah, doesn't work for some reason, just tried it
[09:10:57] <robertmaxrees> which browser are you in?
[09:11:10] <jadew> FF and it appears its error console has become useless
[09:11:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?  i use FF and the console is totally helpful.
[09:11:49] <jadew> robertmaxrees, it fails to report a lot of errors
[09:12:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?  i haven't had that experience unless i uncheck things.
[09:12:19] <jadew> the IE and Chrome have much better implementations of the developer tools
[09:12:43] <jadew> for one they break on errors
[09:12:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree, but okay.  see if you have access to window.parent.document from inside your iframe.
[09:12:49] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with the FF dev tools.
[09:13:24] <jadew> robertmaxrees, there were several occasions when I couldn't, FF didn't even reports some errors
[09:13:27] <jadew> it silently fails
[09:13:45] <Uhkis> never heard ff doing that
[09:13:59] <robertmaxrees> i haven't seen that behavior ever.  there are inconsistencies between browsers that would make it appear that way.
[09:14:04] <Uhkis> using addons? ;)
[09:14:05] <jadew> been seeing these issues a lot
[09:14:40] <robertmaxrees> something seems amiss there, but did you try to log out window.parent.document ?
[09:15:09] <jadew> I tried parent.$etc
[09:15:21] <robertmaxrees> but you did not try window.parent.document ?
[09:15:25] <jadew> went to # (in the iframe) and the error log was silent
[09:15:30] <jadew> I did not
[09:15:45] <jftf> how do you add html to an element that already has html inside of it i.e. html += "etc"?
[09:15:49] <jadew> just did, same behaviour
[09:15:56] <jadew> for the record, $ would have no place under .document
[09:16:01] <jadew> as that's for... well the document
[09:16:16] <workerbeetwo> How to get bold tag inside an A tag? <a href=...><b>TEXT<b/></a>  ,JS: var a=...;  $(a).find('b'); does not seem to work, although $(a).attr('href') works perfectly fine.
[09:16:19] <jadew> jftf, you find a parent node and append nodes to it
[09:16:21] <clarkk> using the code at http://stackoverflow.com/a/13992737, it produces an error "SyntaxError: missing } after property list" (because of the opening bracket of "onBefore: funtion(){"   Can anyone see why this is, please?
[09:16:22] <robertmaxrees> jade for the record, I said "something like" earlier, and we're looking to see if you have access to the parent frame.
[09:16:26] <robertmaxrees> jftf you store the html and then do what you have there.
[09:16:43] <jftf> is it possible to have conditionals in a string variable like that?
[09:16:50] <jadew> robertmaxrees, I have access to the parent window
[09:16:59] <robertmaxrees> jadew but you can't access the parent document object?
[09:17:05] <jadew> you have access to everything in the parent as long as you're not doing cross-domain scripting
[09:17:10] <jadew> of course I can
[09:17:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm completely lost.  hopefully you can figure out whatever you need!
[09:17:36] <jadew> it's jsut that parent.$ nor parent.document.$ doesn't work
[09:17:41] <jadew> and I'm not getty any errors either
[09:17:52] <robertmaxrees> window.parent.document.window.$ <- try this.
[09:18:02] <jadew> are you serious
[09:18:03] <jadew> ?
[09:18:17] <Getty> jadew: ......
[09:18:25] <jadew> window.parent.document.window is window.parent
[09:18:35] <robertmaxrees> try being explicit.  give it a shot.
[09:19:10] <jadew> document.window (if it's actually set) it's just a reference back to the global scope object (window)
[09:19:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:19:30] <robertmaxrees> whatever duder.  giving you things to try.  dunno why you're being so combative.
[09:20:00] <jadew> I'm not cobative, the issue here is that you assume I have no clue
[09:20:32] <jadew> I do, I'm just not familiar with jquery
[09:20:38] <robertmaxrees> the issue here is I'm giving you things to try and you're arguing.  i'm trying to help you get a solution in play.
[09:20:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry for trying to help.
[09:20:53] <jadew> robertmaxrees, because I know they wouldn't work
[09:20:56] <robertmaxrees> clarkk what's your issue?
[09:20:59] <drej> its 2014 and you're a developer, if you dont know jquery fundamentals you're probably doing something wrong
[09:21:00] <drej> just my 2c
[09:21:07] <sky> heh
[09:21:10] * sky rolls eyes
[09:21:17] <clarkk> hi robertmaxrees, I'm getting a syntax error
[09:21:20] <jadew> drej, right, if you're not on fb you don't exist
[09:21:21] <clarkk> using the code at http://stackoverflow.com/a/13992737, it produces an error "SyntaxError: missing } after property list" (because of the opening bracket of "onBefore: funtion(){"   Can anyone see why this is, please?
[09:21:24] * drej pokes sky in his rolled eye
[09:21:32] <jadew> personally, I belive jquery is the sole reason my browser freezes so often
[09:21:41] <drej> brilliant
[09:21:49] <robertmaxrees> clarkk are you trying to pull that function out of the handler?
[09:21:50] <drej> good thing you know what youre talking about
[09:21:51] <jadew> because people have no clue wth they're doing
[09:22:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery's fault, that's bad development.
[09:22:02] <drej> anyway
[09:22:04] * drej steps out
[09:22:22] <jadew> robertmaxrees, jquery promotes bad development, I did check a few examples back in the day
[09:22:37] <jadew> stuff that iterate through all the freaking tags on the page seem "ok"
[09:22:39] <robertmaxrees> jadew i disagree, but that's fine.  i can see why you might feel that way.
[09:22:41] <jadew> and people abuse that crap a lot
[09:22:45] <Soopaman> jadew: do you have a problem that can be solved, or are you just looking for a soapbox?
[09:23:02] <jadew> Soopaman, yes, I need to know where jqeury stores its event table
[09:23:08] <jadew> or how to get to it from window.
[09:23:19] <clarkk> robertmaxrees: could you explain what you mean by "pull that function out of the handler". please?
[09:23:29] <Soopaman> jadew: would you mind elaborating on your use case
[09:23:46] <robertmaxrees> clarkk the code as it stands is valid, so i'm trying to understand where you're getting the syntax error.
[09:24:01] <clarkk> oh
[09:24:07] <jadew> Soopaman, I want to trigger an event $(#someid).trigger('some.event'), from within a child iframe
[09:24:09] <sky> its 2002, do you know where your js fun
[09:24:20] <jadew> the parent obviously uses jqeury, the child window does not
[09:24:21] <clarkk> robertmaxrees: if I comment out those lines, my code works without issue
[09:24:26] <robertmaxrees> clarkk which lines?
[09:24:42] <Soopaman> jadew: and who created the iframe? the rendered markup, or a javascript function
[09:24:47] <robertmaxrees> clarkk can you share a fiddle or fixee is the error?
[09:24:50] <clarkk> the code shown in the answer at http://stackoverflow.com/a/13992737
[09:24:58] <jadew> Soopaman, js
[09:25:02] <robertmaxrees> clarkk that vode is valid and not throwing that error.
[09:25:23] <robertmaxrees> *code
[09:26:01] <Soopaman> jadew: it should be as easy as keeping a reference to the iframe element you created, and then building off of robertmaxrees' suggestion of looking up the dom tree
[09:26:07] <robertmaxrees> jadew for the record -> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L35-L39
[09:26:21] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to find some helpful info there.
[09:26:44] <jadew> robertmaxrees, thanks
[09:27:00] <robertmaxrees> in the future, if you have questions about how jquery does something, go check out the repo on github ;)
[09:27:27] <jadew> robertmaxrees, tbh was hoping this would be common knowledge
[09:27:36] <jadew> as I said earlier, never used jQuery
[09:27:37] <Soopaman> jadew: nothing is common knowledge in web
[09:27:51] <Soopaman> only because you can do the same thing 8billion different ways
[09:28:23] <Soopaman> speaking of which, time to break out the multimeter and check me some solar panels
[09:28:37] <Soopaman> jadew: you're good to go?
[09:28:46] <jadew> Soopaman, not even close, but thanks :)
[09:29:04] <Soopaman> jadew: ask now or forever hold your peace
[09:29:35] <jadew> well, I didn't get my answer yet
[09:29:47] <BillCriswell> Weeeeee
[09:29:52] <Soopaman> you don't need "an answer"
[09:30:01] <kpap> hahaha thanks expunge
[09:30:19] <Soopaman> you are just trying to establish a interface to fire remote events off of
[09:30:22] <BillCriswell> Now I feel the need to listen to Bad Religion.
[09:31:05] <robertmaxrees> jadew also, check out $.data() - jquery stores a lot of stuff using $._data().  you can look at bound events by doing $._data(element, 'events');
[09:31:26] <jadew> thanks, will check it out
[09:31:29] <Soopaman> and technically they aren't remote events, but if the iframe loaded contains a XSS, then you're approach will need to change
[09:31:40] <Soopaman> same domain = change your approach
[09:31:52] <Soopaman> different domain = create interface points
[09:32:08] <jadew> you can't call back on the parent from a different domain
[09:32:33] <Soopaman> that's a key part of the problem you didn't mention
[09:33:08] <Soopaman> if i remember correctly, you can track events on a created and referenced element
[09:33:29] <Soopaman> but the iframe itself has to bubble it's events through it's parent
[09:33:47] <Soopaman> rather the page within the iframe needs to fully propogate it's events
[09:33:48] <robertmaxrees> Soopaman but they understand that all ready :)
[09:33:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:34:03] <Soopaman> lol
[09:34:25] * Soopaman thinks the answer is so obvious that he just doesn't get it
[09:35:09] <BillCriswell> I'm usually in that situation.
[09:35:51] <Soopaman> i think i shall gracefully bow out now, it feels like I've answered the question thrice, missing the point each time
[09:38:05] <jadew> solved it
[09:38:14] <robertmaxrees> nice.  what was the fix?
[09:38:32] <jadew> I called the close button that was on the parent page: parent.document.getElementById('close_button').click();
[09:38:37] <jadew> and let it deal with that stuff
[09:38:38] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[09:38:52] <jadew> was hoping for a more elegant solution but this works too
[09:39:51] <jadew> thanks
[09:59:45] <BillCriswell> Pretty great talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMfS-2ctYjw
[10:08:45] <drej> watching now BillCriswell
[10:08:49] <drej> i do a lot of this stuff day-to-day
[10:09:04] <drej> interesting that they went hybrid even though they only support ipad
[10:10:00] <BillCriswell> I forget the reasoninig for it but he does explain why.
[10:11:02] <drej> app updates
[10:11:05] <drej> basically is what he said
[10:11:17] <drej> which seems like a lot of effort for just that, but im sure there are other reasons
[10:11:20] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah.
[10:11:25] <drej> i mean, im a proponent of hybrid web, so i dont need much reasoning
[10:11:25] <drej> :)
[10:11:41] <BillCriswell> The whole instant updating aspect of things is really nice.
[10:11:52] <drej> yeah
[10:26:54] <thomedy> i have created a scrolling animation. when i link to the second scroll and animate in the container div with context i go straight to the top again.
[10:28:28] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ thomedy
[10:28:28] <b-ot> thomedy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:28:41] <thomedy>  sorry yeah  its lunch time im trying to do both
[10:28:57] <thomedy> im also learning german so.. ich esse mitagessen
[10:29:02] <thomedy> yay for new languages
[10:29:11] <robertmaxrees> well okay
[10:29:21] <Zzaichik> fiddle dee dee it youse.
[10:29:38] <Zzaichik> sounds like e.preventDefault(); needs to be used
[10:29:51] <Zzaichik> That's my educated mega guess
[10:30:03] <Zzaichik> somewhat edukated
[10:30:59] <BillCriswell> In the time of Chimpanzees I was a monkey.
[10:31:15] <Zzaichik> Butane in your veins?
[10:31:22] <BillCriswell> Definitely.
[10:31:45] <robertmaxrees> like a piece of wax, fallin' on a termite, who's chokin' on the splinters.
[10:31:55] <thomedy> this is going to take a second one
[10:32:11] <thomedy> looooooooooooooooong jacket... dee dee dee dee
[10:32:16] <BillCriswell> Classic.
[10:32:32] <drej> BillCriswell some of the things he's talking about are a little silly
[10:32:43] <drej> like writing a whole keyboard from scratch and removing all native inputs into custom divs
[10:32:50] <drej> because their barcode scanner was triggering the keyboard?
[10:33:10] <drej> i mean we have a barcode scanner on our app, we just made it a double-tap on the text input
[10:33:15] <drej> instead of single-click
[10:33:16] <drej> and problem solved
[10:33:31] <BillCriswell> drej: Not sure I'm following there.
[10:33:44] <BillCriswell> How did you prevent the native keyboard from coming up?
[10:35:03] <drej> because doubletap is its own thing
[10:35:20] <drej> it doesnt trigger single tap interactions like focusing the input
[10:35:28] <drej> and we intercept it and launch our barcode scanner camera
[10:35:51] <BillCriswell> The input wouldn't have focus after double tapping?
[10:35:55] <drej> nope
[10:36:03] <BillCriswell> Interesting.
[10:36:04] <drej> because we launch the camera app, and blur the input
[10:36:18] <drej> then get our api to the camera app to just populate the value into the input after its done
[10:37:42] <BillCriswell> drej: My instinct would be just a button and a hidden input, but I've always never worked with that stuff.
[10:37:56] <BillCriswell> It sounds like fun though... a hell of a lot more interesting than what I'm working on now.
[10:37:56] <drej> always never worked
[10:38:08] <drej> yeah, honestly building this hybrid app for the last year has been a TON of fun
[10:38:12] <drej> pushing performance and doing cool things
[10:38:24] <drej> recently i even packaged my own webkit build as the webview for android version of our app
[10:38:55] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a good time.
[10:46:34] <robertmaxrees> i am so excited for next april.
[10:48:10] <BillCriswell> What's next April?
[10:48:44] <robertmaxrees> i get to see buddy guy
[10:49:13] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[10:49:39] <jftf> That's what I call people when I don't remember their name
[10:49:48] <robertmaxrees> jftf hahaha
[10:49:52] <jftf> ...even women :(
[10:50:48] <BillCriswell> When I forget someones name the first thing I do is introduce them to someone else.
[10:51:05] <jftf> I do that too.
[10:51:21] <jftf> I'm actually refocusing on Ruby so I can build a name remembering app
[10:52:04] <BillCriswell> jftf: That sounds interesting.
[10:52:41] <BillCriswell> No matter what I try I forget at least 40% of the time.
[10:52:47] <BillCriswell> Totally made that number up, but it feels right.
[10:53:07] <jftf> well i have a horrible memory and I'm also very  social so its a constant hassle
[10:53:11] <kara_sweets> a name remembering app?
[10:53:27] <jftf> i want to be able to search according to little notes i make of them
[10:53:33] <jftf> in the form of tags
[10:53:46] <BillCriswell> jftf: Oh, I thought you meant like exercises for remembering peoples names.
[10:54:03] <jftf> well yeah BillCriswell as soon asyou input the person's name
[10:54:20] <jftf> it goes into a dictionary and generates other words that start with the same letter as the person's first name
[10:54:51] <jftf> so Joe Janky Jello
[10:55:13] <BillCriswell> jftf: I've tried playing the name game in my head when I meet someone. It just causes me to not focus on what they say and it's even more awkward haha.
[10:55:45] <jftf> well, limericks are an easy technique and my first trick. as the app grows I'll try to add more
[10:56:48] <BillCriswell> Sounds interesting.
[10:57:02] <jftf> thanks :)
[11:09:10] <Guest54894> Hi all

[11:09:25] <Guest54894> you know jquery?
[11:09:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:09:42] <BillCriswell> Guest54894: Just ask. Way easier that way.
[11:09:45] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Guest54894
[11:09:45] <b-ot> Guest54894: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:09:58] <Guest54894> ok
[11:11:45] <robertmaxrees> well that was boring.
[11:11:59] <BillCriswell> The music to the Batman game for NES is so good.
[11:12:08] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzsFS4Plmw
[11:12:33] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell i'm getting so pumped right now.
[11:12:49] <BillCriswell> I remember that game being so hard.
[11:13:24] <robertmaxrees> makes me want to rewatch all the angry video game nerd videos.
[11:13:33] <BillCriswell> They were a good time.
[11:14:15] <Guest54894> Bro I am trying to get a data from a file to another file and load that asynchronous... See what I have made but its not working :( .               http://pastebin.com/Xq5Kgfmi
[11:14:45] <robertmaxrees> mind setting up a nick for yourself?
[11:14:52] <robertmaxrees> just type /nick anyNickNameYouWantHere
[11:15:44] <Guest54894> Sorry some correction here http://pastebin.com/BQddkn4L
[11:16:07] <robertmaxrees> second, have you tried hitting the url directly?
[11:16:19] <kinnngg> means?
[11:16:58] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to load things via ajax - you haave a URL you're trying to load.  have you tried hitting that url with your browser instead of through the JS?
[11:17:17] <Woet> I remember looking at a library a few weeks ago that was made to help out with making live AJAX content/editing very easy. would someone know which one I'm thinking of?
[11:18:18] <kinnngg> yes robertmaxrees I have tried.
[11:18:19] <rainabba> I've been using the following for a while without problems but apparently the content has changed and now it causes "Syntax error, unrecognized expression". I'm not sure either how to determine why it's sudenly failing (and thus how to address the root cause), or another solution that wouldn't be suspecptable to the issue. appendStyle contains an htmlEncoded()  string from a web service and I
[11:18:19] <rainabba> need to create a dom element from it so that I can manipulate that element before adding it to the dom (lpStyle): var lpStyle = $(htmlDecode(appendStyle));
[11:18:22] <rainabba> Suggestions?
[11:18:22] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg if hitting that directly works fine (gives you what you're expecting), then I'd open up your net panel and make sure there are no errors there.
[11:18:40] <robertmaxrees> var $myThing = $('<div/>'); rainabba
[11:18:47] <rainabba> If appendStyle is sufficiently simple, it works fine.
[11:18:49] <robertmaxrees> now $myThing can be treated like any other node.
[11:19:45] <krawchyk> Woet in what context for editing? cms?
[11:19:54] <rainabba> robertmaxrees: Right: var lpStyle = $(htmlDecode(appendStyle));   appendStyle contains htmlEncoded string so I have to htmlDecode before passing to $().
[11:19:58] <Woet> no, all it did is expose it to javascript
[11:19:58] <rainabba> krawchyk: Yes
[11:20:02] <Woet> or jquery, one of the two
[11:20:06] <kinnngg> But I want to access and load data of a another file to a another file bro :(
[11:20:32] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg look at your network panel - do you see any errors?
[11:20:33] <BillCriswell> I need to go into the Drupal admin. ='(
[11:20:35] <kinnngg> and also reload it async
[11:20:37] <krawchyk> Woet i have one in mind but i cant remember it either :(
[11:20:45] <robertmaxrees> Woet jquery Is javascript btw ;)
[11:20:47] <rainabba> krawchyk: Question was bang on so I thought that was meant for me. I'm working on a CMS of sorts.
[11:20:49] <Woet> yes, I know
[11:20:49] <krawchyk> Woet http://aloha-editor.com/
[11:21:02] <Woet> nope, not that one
[11:21:09] <Woet> forgot to bookmark it
[11:21:17] <robertmaxrees> rainabba that should do it, then.
[11:21:33] <krawchyk> Woet http://hallojs.org/
[11:21:49] <Woet> not the one either, it wasn't limited to an editor
[11:21:59] <Woet> i saw some site use it to keep a counter of clicks on a button
[11:22:00] <kinnngg> There is no error sir. Also it load data once but not update it async
[11:22:19] <rainabba> robertmaxrees: I know. That's why I'm here asking for help :)
[11:22:20] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg hold up - what is the actual problem you're having.
[11:22:25] <krawchyk> Woet knockout js? does it have two way data binding?
[11:22:36] <Woet> i'll just have to go through my history
[11:22:41] <krawchyk> Woet http://createjs.org/guide/
[11:22:43] <krawchyk> haha ok
[11:22:53] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg do you mean it doesn't reload every second?
[11:23:00] <robertmaxrees> it just does it once?
[11:23:01] <kinnngg> yes
[11:23:29] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg okay - two things: 1. you want setInterval(), not setTimeout().
[11:23:56] <robertmaxrees> but, the way you're doing this now doesn't guarantee that the ajax request completes before you fire another request off.
[11:24:23] <kinnngg> then any other better method bro ?
[11:25:03] <robertmaxrees> sure - setup a function that calls itself in the .done() callback of .load().
[11:25:26] <kinnngg> :/   any example bro?
[11:25:50] <robertmaxrees> why not try first?
[11:27:48] <kinnngg> calling function itself will make a infinte loop making page keep loading. Isnt it? Or maybe I am not able to get what you say Sir
[11:28:15] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what you want...
[11:28:35] <robertmaxrees> you queue up a setTimeout() after the ajax call completes.
[11:29:18] <kinnngg> ya
[11:29:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/9p06sjzq/ this is an example without the AJAX.
[11:34:09] <kinnngg> thanks
[11:34:42] <robertmaxrees> do you get the basic idea now?
[11:34:49] <kinnngg> ya
[11:35:14] <robertmaxrees> groovy.  in your case, you'll chain .done() onto the .load() and run that setTimeout() call in there.
[11:35:28] <kinnngg> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23408932/jquery-animation-callback-called-too-fast      Like this?
[11:35:54] <robertmaxrees> not exactly, no.
[11:36:13] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[11:36:44] <kinnngg> ok bro :)
[11:37:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/9p06sjzq/1/
[11:37:17] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[11:38:11] <kinnngg> ok Sir. And what this will do? Reload data from another page async ?
[11:38:21] <robertmaxrees> try reading the code please.
[11:38:28] <robertmaxrees> if you have specific questions, let me know :)
[11:38:50] <robertmaxrees> if you're new to jquery, you should check out learn.jquery.com - the tutorials are pretty solid.
[11:39:23] <kinnngg> ok
[11:40:05] <kara_sweets> I'm trying to wrap a div in a link
[11:40:07] <kara_sweets> and its not working
[11:40:10] <kara_sweets> so I'm falling back to jquery
[11:40:16] <robertmaxrees> kara_sweets huh?
[11:40:17] <kara_sweets> whats the best way to mimic a link
[11:40:24] <robertmaxrees> by using a link.
[11:40:34] <kara_sweets> <a href-""> <div></div></a> not working
[11:40:42] <BillCriswell> kara_sweets: You can do <a href="#"><div>Wee</div></a>
[11:40:42] <kara_sweets> for some reason the div appears outside of the link
[11:40:53] <robertmaxrees> make sure the link is block level
[11:41:05] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg you might have to do this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/9p06sjzq/2/
[11:41:33] <BillCriswell> kara_sweets: http://jsbin.com/cizemejibuji/1/edit?html,css,output
[11:41:33] <kinnngg> ok . Your previous just loaded once and stopped
[11:41:43] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg try the second one.
[11:41:46] <kinnngg> ok
[11:43:09] <kinnngg> Ya. Second one working fine . Thanks bro.
[11:43:16] <robertmaxrees> check out those tutorials.
[11:43:21] <kinnngg> Ofcoz
[11:43:53] <kinnngg> I can use it as many time as I want?? becoz i have to make lots of Ajax request in that single page
[11:44:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:44:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to back up a little.
[11:44:49] <robertmaxrees> what all are you doing?
[11:44:57] <kpap> like meclyzene for example? or dramamine type stuffs?
[11:45:36] <kinnngg> I am making a page where I am getting data from 5 pages async and keep loading it in that page
[11:45:42] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:45:59] <robertmaxrees> why not load all the data from one place instead?
[11:47:22] <kinnngg> Load from one place? But I have to distribute all data to different section of page.
[11:47:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:47:41] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use $.ajax() instead.
[11:48:40] <kinnngg> need to use Ajax and set a timeout to that ?
[11:48:52] <Crippy> anyone come across any good articles relating to dynamically loading different image sizes depending on screen size?
[11:49:05] <Crippy> using jquery / ajax
[11:49:13] <robertmaxrees> setup one endpoint and have it generate JSON.  use $.ajax() to pull from that endpoint and disperse the data accordingly, kinnngg
[11:49:38] <Crippy> trying to stop the browser from downloading 2 sets of iamges
[11:50:22] <robertmaxrees> Crippy you'd have to create an object that has all your images in it, detect the screen size, and select the right image for each spot.
[11:50:24] <BillCriswell> Crippy: You can have all images load like a 1x1.gif and then put the different image sizes in data attributes and load tham as needed.
[11:51:01] <kinnngg> ok ...    and for loading it every 1 sec use Timeout or SetInterval?
[11:51:11] <Crippy> ok thanks guys
[11:51:22] <robertmaxrees> kinnngg the basic idea is the same as the $.load()
[11:51:25] <Crippy> trying to optimise the website
[11:51:38] <Crippy> just want it to perform better
[11:51:43] <kinnngg> ok. Thanks :)
[11:51:52] <robertmaxrees> Crippy i'd start by making sure your images are compressed.
[11:51:55] <BillCriswell> Crippy: I'd definitely optimize the images before I go through that.
[11:51:59] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[11:52:06] <robertmaxrees> you can save yourself a TON of bandwidth.
[11:52:52] <Crippy> images are optimisied already, I was thinking of having the same name but second part of src to have a number and loop through the numbers to give me the new size depending on the screen size
[11:53:21] <Crippy> just want to create extra work for myself :p
[11:53:25] <BillCriswell> responsive images just feel... weird to me.
[11:54:08] <Crippy> its more for mobile Im trying to save bandwidth for
[11:54:11] <Crippy> more a test also
[11:54:45] <BillCriswell> Not being able to target specific connection speeds is what turns me off to the whole thing.
[11:55:13] <robertmaxrees> Crippy then you should be doing device detection at the server level imo.
[11:55:49] <BillCriswell> Slow Connects > 1x Fuzzy Images, Fast Connections: Large
[11:56:00] <Crippy> im just using media queries at the minute for normal site flow, but want to try this for images
[11:56:01] <BillCriswell> 2x Large Images*
[11:56:35] <Crippy> I dont want to serve people on mobile large images.
[11:57:13] <BillCriswell> Crippy: I feel like it's ok if they have the connection speed to handle it. ( Just my opnion, probably not popular ) haha
[11:58:27] <Crippy> BillCriswell: lol yea true, its something I havent given much though too and always cheat with img: width: 100%
[11:58:34] <Crippy> cheated*
[11:58:36] <BillCriswell> A lot of smaller screens have higher pixel density's which is why I don't mind giving them the larger images, and larger images on a desktop aren't hurting performance really.
[11:59:24] <Crippy> ok thanks BillCriswell
[11:59:53] <BillCriswell> It just all boils down to their connection speed for me. :-/
[12:04:25] <MikeD_> myselect.on('focus',function(evt){ someotherelement.prop('checked',true); } );  <-- when you click on myselect the dropdown doesn't open, is that normal?
[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:05:35] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing an example?
[12:06:03] <MikeD_> hold on
[12:06:17] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/tipedukusuho/1/edit?html,js,output I can't replicate that
[12:08:18] <MikeD_> damn, that means it's something else about this form that isn't right
[12:08:19] <MikeD_> thanks
[12:09:34] <hooligan321> how can I get a progress event from $.ajax?
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> hooligan321 http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[12:10:34] <hooligan321> ah thanks exactly what I needed
[12:10:47] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: No problem.
[12:11:35] <hooligan321> i looked at ajaxForm but it process's the inputs for you which i dont want I already did that now and I could just do with out another library script
[12:11:57] <robertmaxrees> hooligan321 you need to access the underlying object - jquery don't do this for you.
[12:12:58] <edrahn> How do I stop scrolling to the top when I have a click handler on a link?
[12:13:13] <robertmaxrees> run prevendDefault() against the event object.
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> *preventDefault() i mean
[12:13:49] <FernandoBasso> What is the plugin used in those flipping boxes? http://www.clinicaprodonto.com.br/
[12:16:28] <decx> it's just css
[12:17:20] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: that doesn' t seem to work :(
[12:17:41] <FernandoBasso> decx: Thanks.
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ edrahn
[12:17:42] <b-ot> edrahn: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:17:47] <kirua> hi, in my <input> field http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/1/  , i added a maxlength attribute i want to display a message whan the user is typing and the max length is reached something like this : http://imgur.com/R1G3iJo
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> kirua bind a listener to the input on keypress, get the .val().length of said input, and compare against the .prop('maxlength')
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[12:21:16] <shafox> how to check if a div is at the top of the screen view ?
[12:25:18] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: odd, it works in jdfiddle
[12:25:29] <edrahn> but it doesn't work in a test I made
[12:29:15] <EGreg> hey
[12:29:21] <EGreg> why doesn't jquery.animate call jquery .css when duration is 0?
[12:33:51] <wa5ted> EGreg: its still running that function
[12:33:56] <EGreg> what
[12:34:00] <wa5ted> it has no concept of the duration
[12:34:05] <wa5ted> it doesnt care
[12:34:14] <wa5ted> all it knows okay i need to change this css over this time
[12:40:13] <edrahn> How is jsfiddle different from this test: https://dpaste.de/gupu
[12:40:26] <edrahn> I don't get why jsfiddle works, but the test doesn't
[12:41:04] <BillCriswell> edrahn: </html> ?
[12:41:28] <BillCriswell> Naming your event "el" is confusing.
[12:42:29] <edrahn> BillCriswell: thanks
[12:42:43] <BillCriswell> edrahn: Was that it? I took a guess haha
[12:42:45] <edrahn> BillCriswell: </html> didn't fix it
[12:42:49] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[12:43:00] <edrahn> but thanks for the event tip
[12:48:16] <clarkk> can anyone see any obvious reason why the .css('height') method would return the same value even though the viewport has changed and the element is definitely a different height?  http://jsfiddle.net/a1ecdd0b/
[12:50:05] <SpaceF_> wouldn't know without seeing the dom
[12:50:06] <clarkk> sorry, I mean this http://jsfiddle.net/a1ecdd0b/2/
[12:51:43] <clarkk> ok, SpaceF_ - actually I've just discovered something
[12:51:44] <BillCriswell> clarkk: http://jsfiddle.net/a1ecdd0b/5/ height is changing here.
[12:56:17] <guide_X> question, how do I change this... <select /> to this <select disabled /> with jquery?
[12:56:24] <guide_X> or the reverse
[12:56:44] <guide_X> err <select id="whatev" /> to <select id="whatev" disabled />
[12:57:00] <systemfault> guide_X: element.prop('disabled', theBoolean)
[12:57:14] <systemfault> element being $('#whatever')
[12:57:28] <guide_X> hmm it is a dynamically added element, I'm not sure pure js will help
[12:57:41] <systemfault> What?
[12:57:48] <SpaceF_> That's jquery
[12:57:53] <guide_X> oic ok
[12:58:03] <guide_X> ok thanks then, i'l try it :)
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> guide_X wat
[12:59:23] <robertmaxrees> "I'm not sure pure js will help" - jquery IS js, so it would ;)
[12:59:56] <guide_X> robertmaxrees: I thought he was giving me a non jquery code, didn't realize at first it to be jquery
[13:00:23] <kirua> robertmaxrees>why this doesnt work ? http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/2/
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> kirua check the typeof that prop
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> also, playlistTitle.prop() and playlistTitle.val() won't work - prop and val only work with jquery object.
[13:03:09] <guide_X> hmm "... has no method 'prop'
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:03:29] <SpaceF_> it's an attribute
[13:03:32] <SpaceF_> not property
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> don't use .attr()
[13:03:42] <robertmaxrees> use .prop()
[13:03:58] <guide_X> hmm ok.. but it says "has no method 'prop'" but I'll figure out why,.. maybe my version of jquery
[13:04:12] <robertmaxrees> because the object is not a jquery object.
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/a4cqv652/3/
[13:04:38] <systemfault> guide_X: If your version of jQuery doesn't have .prop, then it's really old.
[13:04:42] <robertmaxrees> $('#playlistTitle').prop('maxlength') will work. playlistTitle.prop('maxlength') won't.
[13:04:54] <guide_X> I did something like $("#blah").prop("disabled", true); anything wrong there?
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> guide_X what version of jquery are you using?
[13:05:13] <guide_X> I'm checking hold on..
[13:05:14] <systemfault> guide_X: type: console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery); in your console
[13:05:31] <guide_X> 1.5.2
[13:05:48] <systemfault> Kind of old. :( We're at 1.11 now I think
[13:05:57] <systemfault> (6 versions later…)
[13:06:01] <robertmaxrees> 1.12 is just around the corner. 1.5.2 was releasted in 2011
[13:06:14] <systemfault> guide_X: Try with .attr but YMMV
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> .prop() was added in 1.6
[13:06:16] <guide_X> yeah, it's pretty old
[13:06:24] <guide_X> systemfault: ok cool i'll try..
[13:06:35] <robertmaxrees> if you can, update to a more recent version.  otherwise, you'll want to use .attr() instead, like systemfault said.
[13:06:50] <guide_X> ah ok cool.. yeah I see, 1.6 is the first with .prop
[13:06:52] <systemfault> .attr was "magic" in older jquery versions.
[13:07:55] <robertmaxrees> you can also do this: http://jsfiddle.net/v23h0sh7/1/
[13:08:52] <guide_X> hmm I'm not sure it'd work with a dynamic object
[13:09:16] <guide_X> hmm .attr("disabled", "disabled"); also doesn't work
[13:09:25] <guide_X> i'll keep trying though, thanks :)
[13:09:28] <robertmaxrees> or use document.getElementByID()
[13:10:30] <deadron> Guaranteed to be cross browser if you just use the native .disabled property
[13:10:30] <systemfault> guide_X: If you're really stuck… you could do var whatever = $('#whatever'); whatever.get(0).disabled = false;
[13:10:49] <guide_X> ah ok cool, i'll try that too
[13:11:10] <systemfault> guide_X: That way, you only leave the jQuery world to enable/disable the control
[13:14:10] <robertmaxrees> guide_X btw http://jsfiddle.net/v23h0sh7/2/ <- vanilla js.  works just fine ;)
[13:15:10] <guide_X> hmm works good when it's not a dynamic select
[13:15:26] <guide_X> for some reason, with a dynamic select it isn't working...
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code to show us what you're doing?
[13:15:51] <guide_X> yeah one second..
[13:16:52] <hooligan321> hm .. when I do my $.ajax request the xhr progress goes to 100% basically instantly, but success happens like much later... any ideas?
[13:17:07] <guide_X> pastebin.com/D9fqVh9k
[13:17:18] <guide_X> this is what I currently have, I've also tried .attr, and .prop
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> guide_X .prop() doesn't exist in the version of js you're using.
[13:17:37] <systemfault> hooligan321: jQuery doesn't support progress events… show us your code.
[13:17:37] <guide_X> yeah
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle and show us there?
[13:17:54] <guide_X> hmm ok
[13:17:56] <systemfault> hooligan321: Well.. it does support progress events.. it's .ajax that doesn't support them.
[13:19:01] <hooligan321> http://jsfiddle.net/g182pv2y/
[13:19:57] <kirua> why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/4/ ?
[13:20:03] <kirua> i'm using bootsrap btw
[13:20:14] <kirua> but their chan is so inactive :(
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> kirua i already showed you the fix for this...
[13:20:33] <kirua> i fixed it i think
[13:20:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/a4cqv652/3/
[13:22:14] <robertmaxrees> your latest isn't valid - you don't close the document ready, $('#playlistTitle').val().length = $('#playlistTitle').attr('maxlength') will always be "true" because you're not actually comparing anything, you're trying to set a var...
[13:23:01] <kirua> ok thanks
[13:23:07] <kirua> but i dont understand the parseInt
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> that's to make sure it's actually a number.
[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> that prop should return a number, but you might have something funky going on.
[13:24:09] <guide_X> http://jsfiddle.net/v23h0sh7/3/
[13:24:21] <robertmaxrees> kirua http://jsfiddle.net/a4cqv652/6/ should work just as well.
[13:24:31] <guide_X> ^^ click the first button, then the second
[13:24:39] <kirua> but why is it parseInt(***,10) ?
[13:24:47] <kirua> what's the purpose of the second argument
[13:24:50] <kirua> 10 in this case
[13:24:50] <robertmaxrees> kirua radix.
[13:24:55] <BillCriswell> RAD
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> some browsers incorrectly assume you want octal when the number starts with a 0.
[13:25:14] <robertmaxrees> so you supply that to work around that problem.
[13:25:27] <guide_X> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/v23h0sh7/3/
[13:25:42] <robertmaxrees> guide_X i'm looking.  one sec.
[13:25:57] <guide_X> when you click blarg2, the select should disable
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/v23h0sh7/4/
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> .disabled is a property on the DOM node, not the jquery object.
[13:26:32] <kirua> thanks !
[13:26:37] <guide_X> oh hmm
[13:26:38] <kirua> http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/a4cqv652/7/ doesn't work for me tho
[13:26:47] <guide_X> that still isn't working thiough
[13:26:55] <robertmaxrees> guide_X the one I just pasted works fine for me...
[13:27:03] <kirua> not sur why
[13:27:05] <guide_X> oh wait it does if I change the b to true
[13:27:06] <kirua> looks correct
[13:27:07] <guide_X> ok cool
[13:27:16] <guide_X> now let me try this in my webapp..
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> kirua i don't know enough about bootstrap to be of much help on that one - you'll want to go bug them about it.
[13:28:27] <guide_X> yes that works, thanks!
[13:28:29] <hooligan321> systemfault did i find snake oil?
[13:29:18] <systemfault> hooligan321: Let me see
[13:31:35] <hooligan321> system fault i correct the xhr part to be "load" instead of complete as well a which was a mistake ..
[13:32:55] <systemfault> hooligan321: Beside the myXhr which doesn't seem to be declared.. it looks okay.
[13:33:24] <hooligan321> oh yeah
[13:33:27] <systemfault> hooligan321: Do you have a working example?
[13:33:46] <hooligan321> woot
[13:33:51] <hooligan321> just had to add the var
[13:37:17] <hooligan321> thanks works well now but success still take ages to happen i guess it must really be the php script take long for some reason
[13:38:11] <hooligan321> I could just not use sucess and use the xhr load
[13:38:40] <hooligan321> but you dont rely on a response from the server that way
[13:39:29] <hooligan321> more like i sent them you better of got it right lol
[13:39:42] <drej> hooligan321 you can keep an eye out on the network tab
[13:39:46] <drej> and see if its the api thats coming back slowly
[13:39:58] <drej> that will at least help you determine where the thing is being held up
[13:46:51] <hooligan321> ty drej yep 100% the php ... its just sits there pending
[13:47:04] <hooligan321> 34.89s
[13:47:06] <drej> damn
[13:47:44] <drej> is it your own app or a 3rd party api you're hitting?
[13:47:52] <drej> maybe scale up your hosting or something for a quick immediate performance gain?
[13:49:34] <dmsuperman> lol drej that's the spirit!
[13:49:44] <dmsuperman> just throw more power at it don't sort the actual issue :P
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> throw iron at the problem until it goes awayu.
[13:49:55] <hooligan321> yea ha blocking 1ms connecting 87ms sendign 1ms waiting 38.89s  ... all I am doing is using $_FILES realy in that script so yeah I am going to investigate and run some similations on that right now..
[13:50:17] <drej> dmsuperman thats why i said "quick immediate gain"
[13:50:20] <drej> and not "solution to problem" :)
[13:50:37] <dmsuperman> I'm just giving you shit it's just funny because that's always the first (bad) approach to problems anymore
[13:50:42] <drej> haha
[13:50:44] <hooligan321> listen drej i am sorry about before as well.. im just a stress head
[13:50:50] <drej> hooligan321 all good brother
[13:50:58] <drej> your ban's been lifted
[13:50:59] <drej> just fyi
[13:51:22] <LucasTT> is there a javascript/jquery function to escape html from a string?
[13:51:23] <hooligan321> tnanx
[13:51:56] <dmsuperman> LucasTT: a quick google gave me this as the #1 result: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24816/escaping-html-strings-with-jquery
[13:52:03] <BillCriswell> LucasTT: You want to remove the html tags or make it so you can display it?
[13:52:26] <LucasTT> i found that link before dmsuperman, but doesn't seem what i need
[13:52:34] <LucasTT> BillCriswell: make it so i can display it
[13:52:51] <LucasTT> ie: $(unsafeString).escape()
[13:52:52] <dmsuperman> well what do you need? because that most definitely will escape HTML characters so they can be displayed
[13:53:00] <BillCriswell> That links shows you how you can do that.
[13:53:31] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/modemugavidu/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:53:57] <arbiter34> is there a specific channel I should go to for qtip help?
[13:54:14] <LucasTT> right, thanks
[13:54:20] <BillCriswell> How about the EAR channel. Hahahahahaha
[13:54:27] * dmsuperman groans
[13:54:30] <LucasTT> it's because i neeeed to append html code with escaped code
[13:54:45] <LucasTT> needed*
[13:54:46] <BillCriswell> arbiter34: No idea.
[13:54:57] <BillCriswell> You can probably try in here though.
[13:55:08] <BillCriswell> or should I say... "in hear"
[13:55:31] <BillCriswell> You're welcome everyone.
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> *crickets*
[13:55:45] <dmsuperman> *flamethrowers*
[13:56:17] <BillCriswell> My day has been such dog shit. I really dislike Drupal with every ounce of my being.
[13:56:39] <BillCriswell> That's 4,000 ounces.
[13:58:11] <PantsOfChoco> i thought that said 40k
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> warhammer?
[13:58:17] <PantsOfChoco> and i was like dude you need to diet
[13:58:36] <PantsOfChoco> cause then youd be 2.5k
[13:58:46] <BillCriswell> YEah, that would be pretty heavy.
[13:59:15] <PantsOfChoco> well dont worry
[13:59:16] <BillCriswell> 250 is still pretty big, but it's getting to be a lot more muslce which is good.
[13:59:22] <PantsOfChoco> my day is worse.
[13:59:37] <PantsOfChoco> i just applied for a job at buzzfeed...
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not that bad.
[13:59:50] <PantsOfChoco> SO BAD
[13:59:54] <BillCriswell> I bet they have some sweet perks.
[14:00:00] <BillCriswell> and some interesting challenges.
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> i want to work at the onion.
[14:00:08] <BillCriswell> I bet it would actually be a great time.
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> so i can participate in projects like fartscroll.js
[14:00:27] <BillCriswell> As long as you can avoid reading the content that is.
[14:00:34] <PantsOfChoco> but i kinda hate the whole programmers trying to have the coolest office mentality nowadays
[14:00:39] <PantsOfChoco> hahahah exactly
[14:00:43] <PantsOfChoco> and let me write some content
[14:01:01] <PantsOfChoco> top 40 things only kids from the 90s that watched dawsons creek and drank surge would understand all in gifs
[14:01:28] <BillCriswell> There was one today I saw on my news feed today about "20 things you probably didn't know about depression".
[14:01:41] <BillCriswell> Those gifs are really going to help me understand depression.
[14:02:09] <PantsOfChoco> hahaha just cause of robin williams, ugh hate those sites, as long as they pay me good money im fine they just got a huge investment
[14:03:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, money is nice.
[14:03:20] <BillCriswell> At this point I think I'd take less money if I was guaranteed no contact with Drupal.
[14:04:51] <PantsOfChoco> haha im a django and python developer ill never come in contact with it
[14:05:10] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what I am.
[14:05:18] <advorak> x = $.getJSON('/uni/result.json') ---- how can I access the responseJSON from within the x object?
[14:05:36] <BillCriswell> advorak: x.done(function(response){ ... });
[14:06:47] <advorak> BillCriswell, Thank you so much :-)
[14:07:08] <BillCriswell> advorak: no sweat.
[14:08:25] <BillCriswell> 	
[14:08:33] <BillCriswell> Sorry, cleaning keyboard.
[14:08:36] <dmsuperman> what happens if you don't define a .done BillCriswell?
[14:08:40] <dmsuperman> will it just never execute?
[14:08:57] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: It just kind of sits there and hangs out I think.
[14:09:31] <BillCriswell> Damn, computer is looking handsome.
[14:10:40] <BillCriswell> Night everyone.
[14:15:50] <scri66le> how come when I append and add a button my preventDefault() no longer works?
[14:16:07] <robertmaxrees> because your bindings don't magically update.  use event delegation instea.d
[14:16:56] <scri66le> so instead of append, use delegate?
[14:17:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:17:21] <robertmaxrees> use delegation for your event bindings.
[14:17:47] <scri66le> instead of click robertmaxrees ?
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('click', 'child', function() {});
[14:20:56] <scri66le> not like this -> http://pastebin.com/KE8AerYG robertmaxrees
[14:23:30] <robertmaxrees> I'm lost about what's going on here.  are you adding new .addSnippet that you want to bind all this logic to?
[14:26:53] <scri66le> robertmaxrees, I am adding a shortcodebutton on a addSnippet click
[14:27:57] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you're not replacing anything relating to the .addSnippet
[14:28:29] <robertmaxrees> because the code you have is pretty straightforward and should work just fine.
[14:29:11] <scri66le> it works, just the preventDefault() doesn't work on the newly added a
[14:29:23] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you ARE adding new a tags.
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> event binding only works for things that exist at the time of binding.
[14:30:15] <Tomashe> Hey guys , was wondering, there is a way to filter spans by text on input text write.. so if user start to write x , it will show him all input that start with x and so on..
[14:31:18] <robertmaxrees> scri66le http://jsfiddle.net/argy10k6/
[14:32:11] <robertmaxrees> the second way (using delegation) will allow you to add as many <a> tags as you want without re-binding anything.
[14:32:14] <robertmaxrees> it just works.
[14:45:50] <Tomashe> hey guys, why this isnt working : $(this).parent().find("span:not():contains('"+key+"')").hide();
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log() everything up to the hide.
[14:50:42] <robertmaxrees> also, you want :not(:contains())
[14:52:40] <dunkel2> hello
[14:57:06] <the8thbit|work> I have the following html:
[14:57:09] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon, dunkel2
[14:57:09] <the8thbit|work> <select id="requesttime[day]" class="atkdateattribute" onchange="AdjustDate(this, 'requesttime');" name="requesttime[day]">
[14:57:28] <the8thbit|work> however, when I try console.log($j("#requiredtime[month]").val());
[14:57:28] <dunkel2> have you guys used picturefill ?
[14:57:33] <the8thbit|work> I get undefined
[14:57:42] <the8thbit|work> why don't I get the currently selected value?
[14:58:01] <the8thbit|work> wait
[14:58:09] <robertmaxrees> the8thbit|work ;) also, don't use onchange
[14:58:32] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ dunkel2
[14:58:38] <b-ot> dunkel2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:59:19] <the8thbit|work> robertmaxrees: unfortunately that is built by my PHP framework so I can't not use onchange
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> the8thbit|work :( that's frustrating.
[14:59:59] <dunkel2> im trying to use picturefill to make some responsive images using the img srcset and sizes atributes, but it is not working ofr iphone or android, only for desktop and ipad, on the desktop i canresize the window and get the desired behaviour, but on the android phone it just ignores the image
[15:00:09] <the8thbit|work> robertmaxrees: It's a horrible framework! Everyone at work hates it :)
[15:00:19] <the8thbit|work> it uses iframes
[15:00:21] <the8thbit|work> iframes.
[15:01:08] <robertmaxrees> also, the html fragment you posted doens't match your JavaScript.
[15:01:22] <the8thbit|work> robertmaxrees: Yeah, thats why I said "wait"
[15:01:36] <the8thbit|work> but lets just pretend it does, because I copied and pasted the wrong line into this chat :)
[15:03:00] <the8thbit|work> the one below that one is: <select id="requiredtime[month]" class="atkdateattribute" onchange="AdjustDate(this, 'requiredtime');" name="requiredtime[month]">
[15:03:05] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:03:14] <the8thbit|work> okay
[15:04:54] <robertmaxrees> ooooh ahhahahahahaha
[15:04:55] <robertmaxrees> easy
[15:05:07] <rainabba> robertmaxrees: Turns out that the string (which was a <style> block with CSS in it), had ONE bad rule with a ; instead of :. Once fixed, all was well again. :)
[15:05:07] <the8thbit|work> Oh yeah?
[15:05:56] <robertmaxrees> square brackets are reserved for attribute selectors
[15:06:06] <the8thbit|work> fuck
[15:06:12] <the8thbit|work> thats also my framework
[15:06:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/Lckf7svu/
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> just have to escape them.
[15:06:20] <the8thbit|work> I was really hoping that wasn't the issue
[15:06:23] <the8thbit|work> ahhh
[15:06:25] <the8thbit|work> ok
[15:07:13] <the8thbit|work> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:09:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah - i forget about that one sometimes.
[15:21:24] <newhere> hi all
[15:23:52] <newhere> http://pastebin.com/b3Mahjhu     Running this make my browser hang. how can I modify it to get it running . plz help
[15:24:17] <robertmaxrees> newhere lol i told you not to do this earlier ;)
[15:24:25] <robertmaxrees> this is exactly the wrong way to do this.
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't need the outer document ready.
[15:24:44] <newhere> Ya. But I wanna test this also :)
[15:25:02] <newhere> Data recieved is Heavy
[15:25:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to abstract out each load into a separate function.
[15:25:12] <newhere> Any solution to get all by once?
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> create one endpoint with all your data.
[15:25:34] <newhere> how?
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> have your PHP return JSON.
[15:25:47] <thinkxl> lol
[15:26:07] <thinkxl> newhere: what sorcery are you doing there
[15:26:53] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/lgk3saq/ <- have your php return something like this.
[15:27:04] <newhere> ok Made it return JSON data.
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> multiple ajax calls are a bad idea.
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> do one call that returns everything you need.
[15:27:32] <robertmaxrees> then parse the JSON.
[15:27:55] <newhere> and how view all in different Divs ?
[15:28:01] <thinkxl> newhere: you are doing back-end work in the front-end
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> by parsing the returned data.
[15:29:04] <newhere> ok
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/0ywxgn27/
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> simple stuff.
[15:31:54] <newhere> ok
[15:32:15] <newhere> ad user .load() and timeouts to reload data . Right ?
[15:32:25] <newhere> or Ajax?
[15:32:36] <robertmaxrees> load uses ajax under the hood.
[15:33:04] <newhere> ok
[15:33:37] <robertmaxrees> you'll want $.ajax() instead though.
[15:33:56] <thinkxl> reload data?
[15:34:03] <thinkxl> why not socket.io ?
[15:34:07] <robertmaxrees> he wants to refresh the data on the page every second.
[15:34:17] <thinkxl> wut!
[15:34:19] <thinkxl> why?
[15:34:26] <robertmaxrees> if he's new to jquery and struggling, adding socket.io will confuse them even more ;)
[15:34:29] <thinkxl> ://
[15:34:41] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: yup, you right
[15:36:01] <robertmaxrees> newhere http://fixee.org/paste/1683mds/ it'll wind up looking something like this.
[15:36:14] <robertmaxrees> line 8 might not be exactly what you need, but you should get the idea
[15:37:27] <newhere> Thanks bro
[15:38:52] <robertmaxrees> did you go to learn.jquery.com yet?
[16:30:31] <thomedy> is anyone working
[16:30:44] <snover> no
[16:30:47] <thomedy> bummer
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:31:00] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[16:31:19] <thomedy> okay sorry i meant to do this.... what.....? six hours ago..
[16:31:25] <thomedy> im a parent
[16:31:28] <thomedy> okay... http://jsfiddle.net/ny72ke5j/11/
[16:31:29] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/ny72ke5j/11/
[16:31:39] <thomedy> im trying to decide the best approach
[16:31:52] <thomedy> the red boxes are links
[16:32:02] <thomedy> the words in the center of each image at the top are links too
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> that's the same link twice btw.
[16:32:43] <thomedy> if click an internal red link then it scrolls to corresponding image
[16:33:01] <thomedy> and then if you are at 2nd image or 3rd and click the mdidle
[16:33:35] <thomedy> word on the image then it fixes goes to the firs timage
[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> you're making this harder than it needs to be btw :)
[16:34:40] <thomedy> my explanation or my code?
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> your code.
[16:34:50] <thomedy> im an eager student?
[16:34:51] <robertmaxrees> not even reading your explanation yet :)
[16:34:58] <thomedy> thats probably for the better
[16:35:33] <robertmaxrees> so first of all you're doing a lot of replication in your JS - every time you add a new section, you have to add a new block on js - this is bad.
[16:35:57] <thomedy> okay...
[16:36:31] <thomedy> what do you mean block
[16:36:38] <robertmaxrees> your if checks.
[16:37:06] <thomedy> your saying my if blocks...
[16:37:10] <thomedy> let me give you some context
[16:37:14] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[16:37:19] <thomedy> holding
[16:37:30] <robertmaxrees> totally unnecessary.  also, as an aside, right now your code checks each condition to see if it matches.  use else if instead so the conditional stops running.
[16:37:42] <robertmaxrees> now, we can decouple the scrolling logic from the data pretty easily.
[16:38:37] <robertmaxrees> ready to see me remove a bunch of code?
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ny72ke5j/12/
[16:39:31] <robertmaxrees> this is one of a few ways to skin this case.
[16:39:33] <robertmaxrees> *cat
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[16:41:05] <thomedy> yours still hasn't answered my question though ... sorry
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> okay, so then what's the question?
[16:41:24] <thomedy> i mean i can answer it
[16:41:47] <robertmaxrees> i saw you come in and say "what's the best approach" and then you pasted the same link twice, so I'm not sure what I'm comparing.
[16:43:10] <thomedy> switch images and then click the number in the middle so your in 2nd or 3rd image and click the content in in
[16:43:18] <thomedy> and sense its fixed it goes to the top image
[16:43:22] <thomedy> i want to stay where im at
[16:43:55] <thomedy> honestly i could fix this myself... just curious
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> why are you changing the container to fixed positioning?
[16:45:20] <thomedy> on the matte rof the efficience of the code... i was just trying to push something out quick im very short on time and once i launched the site i was going to optimize
[16:45:33] <thomedy> i kind of thought i had to actually
[16:45:44] <thomedy> becauses i want the images to stay put while the content scrolls
[16:45:51] <thomedy> so fixed
[16:47:13] <jost> I need a way to wait for several callbacks and do something when all of them are finished. Some callbacks may even be called before the last one is known, some may be called later. Is there an easy way in jQuery to do something like this? Maybe using a deferred object?
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> thomedy which images and which content?
[16:47:51] <thomedy> in the background are images
[16:48:04] <thomedy> when the content scrolls in the images stop scrolling and the content scrolls
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> thomedy okay - so when the thing opens you want the background to stay in one spot?
[16:48:16] <thomedy> in my actuall project its a bit more involved
[16:48:32] <thomedy> yes
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> you want to do $('body').css('overflow', 'hidden'); to prevent the background scroll, then.
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> you probably want fixed positioning for your overlay dealio,.
[16:50:41] <thomedy> really that never occured to me thank you
[16:50:49] <thomedy> i figured fixed was the way to go ill try that
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/ny72ke5j/13/
[16:52:45] <thomedy> hidden didni't work
[16:52:55] <robertmaxrees> play with your CSS.
[16:53:04] <robertmaxrees> whatever element is scrolling needs to have overflow: hidden applied to it.
[16:53:04] <thomedy> it hides content too
[16:53:08] <kachi8> mY PIEACE be not a rotten berry
[16:53:36] <thomedy> okay... tha twill work
[16:53:43] <thomedy> i can do this
[16:55:20] <robertmaxrees> cool :)
[17:08:53] <EGreg> hey everyone
[17:08:56] <EGreg> is John Resig here?
[17:09:33] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it at the moment :)
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[17:11:18] <robertmaxrees> EGreg did you have a particular problem?
[17:25:22] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun.
[17:26:08] <_6a68> lol
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> wondeer why they wanted to talk to John.  He's not really attached much to the project any more.
[17:30:55] <_6a68> yeah, idk
[17:33:36] <serin38> Any suggestions on how I would detect when the bottom of an element while scrolling which has many on the screen?
[17:34:38] <robertmaxrees> serin hrm?
[17:52:28] <NeedAjaxHelp> I need help with a AJAX -> PHP Mailer
[17:52:57] <NeedAjaxHelp> How do I limit messages sent, or put a time limit between successful attempts
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> in your backend.
[17:53:30] <NeedAjaxHelp> Do I use sessions to track that?
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> store the time of the last sent message from a session/ip/account/whatever
[17:54:15] <jost> NeedAjaxHelp: You should probably also use some approach that limits the number of mails sent globally
[17:54:49] <NeedAjaxHelp> I've been having a hell of a time with 1and1 hosting to modify the .htaccess permissions to get file caching.. otherwise I would totally go that route
[17:55:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:55:08] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with htaccess
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> do you have a database?
[17:55:33] <NeedAjaxHelp> Yes, but getting php.ini access is also going to be a problem, I assume
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> are you using php now?
[17:55:50] <NeedAjaxHelp> yes
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> and you have access to a DB, right?
[17:56:05] <NeedAjaxHelp> No, I'm not using a database
[17:56:18] <robertmaxrees> okay.  you should set one up.
[17:56:21] <NeedAjaxHelp> Why?
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> so you can do things like store user data.
[17:56:39] <NeedAjaxHelp> I don't need user data
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> and active sessions.
[17:57:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you can use sessions - just store info in each one about the last email that was sent.
[18:02:33] <frankle> what does jquery's scrollTop do different than the native Element.scrollTop?
[18:03:55] <BillCriswell> frankle: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24445584/what-is-the-difference-between-scrolltop-method-and-scrolltop-property-in-jque
[18:07:45] <frankle> BillCriswell: thanks
[18:07:57] <BillCriswell> frankle: No problem.
[18:21:04] <frank_o> Hi, if you guys were to mimick the iOS 7 checkbox switch -- would you use the CSS (http://codepen.io/joshnh/pen/hjbuH) or the jQuery version (https://github.com/mnmly/ios7-switch)?
[18:22:03] <frank_o> Asking in #css as well since this is a 50/50 thing
[18:39:20] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Not sure what JS is adding to the button.
[18:39:36] <frank_o> BillCriswell: lol
[18:39:42] <frank_o> :)
[19:06:36] <lorfds> is anyone here familiar with the jscroll script?
[19:06:43] <lorfds> for infinite scrolling
[19:08:29] <lorfds> anyone here familiar with the jscroll script?
[19:08:36] <lorfds> for infinite scrolling
[19:09:12] <lorfds> it is killing me right now, works except for doing this really weird thing where once it loads results once, it overwrites the last set of results instead of appending
[19:21:36] <sammych> who wants to vertically line this up for me WITHOUT changing the markup http://jsfiddle.net/jLumyrhp/1/
[19:40:45] <Jattenalle> sammych, http://jsfiddle.net/jLumyrhp/2/ or do you want to use JS instead?
[19:40:59] <Jattenalle> for the record, changing the CSS is the proper way to do it
[20:08:27] <Forbidd3n> anyone know where I can find a good example of progress bar updating via ajax call to long loading php script
[22:27:31] <wa5ted> google it

[23:53:13] <systemfault> Macaveli: Could you explain better? Perhaps by showing us your code
[23:53:44] <Macaveli> systemfault just going to try this last thing
[23:54:12] <systemfault> ok:)
[23:55:22] <Macaveli> found it
[23:55:31] <Macaveli> I needed to use .html() instead of .text()
[23:56:36] <systemfault> Awesome :)
