[04:43:17] <dimi1947> in order to set a data attribute with the jjuery...is it necessary that the data atrr pre exists in the element ?
[04:54:12] <dimi1947> i think I got it
[06:39:05] <dimi1947> is it correct that data() has nothing to do with the html data attr?
[07:32:49] <Cork> dimi1947: no it isn't
[07:33:24] <Cork> it predates the data attribute, and it can store more data types then data attr can but if there isn't an entry jquery will try to fetch the data from the data- attribute
[07:33:53] <dimi1947> and this is the weird thing
[07:33:58] <Cork> but after the first fetch .data() doesn't reflect later changes to the attribute
[07:34:15] <dimi1947> I know...
[07:37:10] <dimi1947> I mean..think of it for a while...with data('foo','bar')...you store this data in  jquery cache...but data() (if cache is empty return the value of data attr)
[07:40:19] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/usyomdh4/
[07:40:48] <Cork> if you store a value in .data() it won't use the data- attribute
[07:40:57] <Cork> it only ever looks there if there isn't an entry
[07:45:53] <dimi1947> I have understood this...but I think it messes things...this a qquestion probably that it shoukd be answered by jquery developers
[07:46:35] <Cork> dimi1947: not sure what the problem is
[07:46:56] <dimi1947> there is no problem,,,just some thougghts
[07:46:57] <Cork> if the key exist, no matter what value it has (including undefined) won't check the attribute
[07:47:12] <dimi1947> anyway
[07:47:21] <Cork> and that is the intended function of the method
[07:47:45] <dimi1947> i am ok with that...just made some thoughts and nothing else
[10:38:53] <jak2020> hi
[10:39:08] <jak2020> how to ask/know if a class is button or not? thanks
[17:11:01] <codecutter> how to copy text to clipboard?
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in ##javascript codecutter :)
[17:18:41] <codecutter> ok
[23:09:48] <jnewt> need some help applying autogrow for textarea  I have $(document).on('click',".ag", function(){$(.ag).autogrow();});  I want to have .autogrow() applied without waiting on a 'click' or any other action.
[23:10:56] <robertmaxrees> .on('input'
[23:11:07] <robertmaxrees> is autogrow something you made?
[23:14:02] <robertmaxrees> jnewt
[23:14:52] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, no, it's a plugin i downloaded.   input isn't really what i want.  i have elements loaded and filled via ajax, and i just want them to expand to fit the text and keep expanding as the text is changed.   maybe the first part is just a css problem,
[23:15:20] <jnewt> https://plugins.jquery.com/autogrow/
[23:15:41] <robertmaxrees> then call that in the .then() of the ajax calls.
[23:17:20] <robertmaxrees> or see if a .trigger() will be enough to get it to fire.
[23:19:17] <robertmaxrees> just $('.ag').autogrow(); before anything else, then $('.ag').trigger('input') in the .then() of the ajax calls
[23:19:19] <robertmaxrees> might work.
