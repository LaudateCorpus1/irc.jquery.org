[00:23:49] <kostodo> Trying to make a drop down menu compatible with iOS devices (iPhone, iPad)
[00:24:00] <kostodo> The normal menu is working on an li:hover
[00:24:07] <hooloovoo> got a sort of weird issue. i have a menu thingie that's supposed to follow the scroll of the window using a couple of criteria. thing is that this menu sometimes lags a frame behind the scroll, especially when scrolling fast. not sure how to solve that. i've tried speeding up the script but it doesn't help.
[00:24:11] <kostodo> iOS seems to struggle with :hover
[00:24:15] <ravenzz> kostodo that's bad idea
[00:24:24] <kostodo> Can someone be kind enough to look at the following: http://jsfiddle.net/KdY84/
[00:24:29] <ravenzz> in terms of accesibility
[00:24:50] <hooloovoo> the only solution i can think of is syncing the scrolling to the menu movement by preventing it then scroll it using scrollTop(), but that doesn't seem to work either.
[00:24:58] <ravenzz> you should show/hide it on click/focus
[00:25:39] <ravenzz> kostodo http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/
[00:25:39] <kostodo> ravenzz: yes that is what HAS to happen for an iOS device
[00:25:58] <ravenzz> implement it like the article explains
[00:26:12] <krz> how do i check if an attribute is an empty string
[00:26:13] <ravenzz> it would be pretty easy to add some js
[00:26:31] <kostodo> ravenzz: did you look at the jsfiddle i posted?
[00:26:42] <krz> attar value. that is
[00:26:44] <ravenzz> krz if ($.trim(elem.val()))
[00:26:48] <krz> err
[00:26:54] <krz> attribute's value
[00:27:00] <kostodo> The menu exists, and works just fine in desktop browsers. It also works just fine on Android.
[00:27:31] <kostodo> I'm trying to write some JS to make it also work for iOS. With a bind click and toggleClass
[00:27:33] <krz> ravenzz: ($.trim($('#song_profile').attr('data-current-user-id').val())) ?
[00:27:37] <kostodo> but its not really working out too well
[00:28:13] <ravenzz> krz oh no, in that case if ($.trim($('#song_profile').attr('data-current-user-id'))) {} is just fine
[00:28:47] <ravenzz> kostodo are you using jQuery for other stuff ?
[00:28:55] <kostodo> yes
[00:28:58] <krz> ravenzz: that returns ""
[00:29:04] <krz> how does that answer my question
[00:29:17] <krz> might as well do: $('#song_profile').attr('data-current-user-id').length
[00:29:36] <ravenzz> krz "" evaluates to false
[00:29:56] <kostodo> ravenzz: don't see why it wouldn't work. but it doesn't.
[00:30:02] <krz> ah
[00:30:10] <ravenzz> ?falsy
[00:30:14] <ravenzz> mm
[00:31:23] <kostodo> ravenzz: did you look at the jsfiddle?
[00:32:09] <kostodo> basically its working on the iOS now but its not toggling. touching the heading drops the menu down but it doesn't close it up again when you toggle
[00:32:15] <kostodo> (or touch it again)
[00:32:33] <ravenzz> mh
[00:33:29] <ravenzz> hold on
[00:35:18] <ravenzz> kostodo mh do you have more then 1 level submenus right?
[00:35:25] <kostodo> yes
[00:36:29] <kostodo> maybe i need to select only the FIRST ('ul.menu li.nolink')
[00:36:53] <kostodo> because that selector can catch even the sub menu levels
[00:39:03] <kostodo> but i don't think thats the problem
[00:56:32] <kostodo> ravenzz: any idea?
[01:17:38] <krz> how does one set 'true' to true
[01:18:00] <krz> or 'false' to false
[01:18:09] <krz> of boolean type
[01:18:41] <didiergm> true is true in js; in jquery pass it as a string 'true'
[01:18:49] <didiergm> or 'false'
[01:18:57] <krz> i need to convert 'false' to false
[01:19:40] <didiergm> var x=  (v == 'false') ? false : true;
[01:20:04] <constantin_mike> try Boolean('true') -> true
[01:20:06] <constantin_mike> same for false
[01:20:21] <constantin_mike> ah, lol ...
[01:20:29] <constantin_mike> for false returns true also
[01:21:31] <constantin_mike> didiergm's solution is ok :)
[01:21:50] <didiergm> constantin in boolean anything is true except 0, '', null, and I believe undefined
[01:22:11] <constantin_mike> yep
[01:22:32] <constantin_mike> silly me
[01:23:00] <krz> ok makes sense. thanks
[01:25:23] <didiergm> if I had $1 everytime I gort caught ... I wouln'd be here :)
[01:26:57] <constantin_mike> where would you be, then?
[01:26:59] <constantin_mike> :)
[01:27:42] <didiergm> somewhere lying on a beach or on my new yacht; but one never gets paid for silly mistakes :(
[01:28:28] <constantin_mike> true, but still, you learn good things that help you earn some money in the end :)
[01:28:59] <constantin_mike> but still, you don't get to end up on a yacht :))
[01:30:00] <mynameis> lol,what yall talking bout
[01:37:42] <krz> OT. anyone here use coffee script. know how to do function foobar() { ... }?
[01:45:59] <danheberden> krz: a quick google search on coffeescript basics should help you out
[01:46:05] <danheberden> namely, how to use ->
[01:46:43] <faraway> is there a way to get the position/offset of a <br> element ? the result of .offset() and .position()  are at least not correct in chrome? (currently i use a workaround that adds a span in front, and check this position, but i would like to avoid this)
[01:50:40] <danheberden> faraway: that's gonna be wonky with void elements like that
[01:51:02] <danheberden> your approach of adding an element (or changing the style of the br) is probably the best route
[01:53:04] <faraway> danheberden: hmm, ok then i'll stay with this for now
[01:56:25] <Nebros> [10:21] <Nebros> i have here a js which filter me an option list. at first, i have the lines with diffrent colors, (grey, white, grey, white...) but when i use now this filter, the values in the option list are not colored anymore. how can i fix this? i beleve it must be between lines105 - 164... http://jsfiddle.net/eqXbL/ the colors are given in css
[01:56:48] <Nebros> if there was an aswer, i did not see it. i had a disconnect...
[01:57:10] <Nebros> pls copy paste the answer, if there is anyone. :)
[02:01:02] <didiergm> Nebros. Looking @ your code you copy text & value; but nowhere any indication of color (css or else) so no copy
[02:01:45] <danheberden> you understand 'this', if you call filterlist() is going to be window, right?
[02:01:51] <danheberden> thus, you're just making global vars
[02:02:21] <didiergm> or you must reapply the js that adds the css
[02:02:28] <danheberden> and what happened to: nth-child(2n)
[02:02:38] <danheberden> why is your javascript managing your css
[02:03:30] <faraway> Nebros: btw .. if you get disconnected you can always browse the logs http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[02:04:52] <Nebros> my js is not managing the css. when the page loads first time, i have this color in css and it makes me colors. but when this js is used (tape in a word for the filter) it will regenerate the optionlist, and is no more based on the simple html
[02:05:25] <Nebros> nice to know with this logs. :)
[02:05:42] <danheberden> Nebros: css is based on the active elements in the page
[02:06:03] <danheberden> if you are using something like option:nth-child(2n) { background:#999; }
[02:06:11] <danheberden> it will apply to any elements in the select
[02:06:12] <danheberden> period.
[02:06:22] <danheberden> if you're manually adding classes to do this
[02:06:50] <danheberden> thus, having to manage the css with javascript, then you'll have to repeat this behaviour when you add elements
[02:10:06] <Nebros> is there no way to give in this code something like "make the first line with color 1 and the second with color 2"   var color1 = '#fff'   ... "color 1 if loop %2 == 1" or something?
[02:10:24] <Nebros> it doesent matter if it ignore the css colors
[02:13:04] <delboy1978uk> why would my Bootstrap Modal close straight after opening when I inistialise it with javascript?
[02:13:04] <delboy1978uk> $('a.treedelete-file').click(function(){ $('#delete-modal').modal(); });
[02:13:36] <delboy1978uk> it works fine when i initialise it the non javascript wayu
[02:13:53] <danheberden> Nebros: that's what the nth-child psuedo-selector does
[02:13:57] <danheberden> google it
[02:14:12] <Cork> delboy1978uk: try gunction(event) { event.prevetnDefault(); }
[02:14:23] <Cork> and if that doesn't help try event.stopPropagation()
[02:14:38] <delboy1978uk> ah. cheers again Cork!
[02:14:39] <danheberden> gunction, i like it
[02:14:48] <delboy1978uk> are you evere off here lol? :-P
[02:15:03] <delboy1978uk> i know lol me too, gunction
[02:15:11] <Cork> heh well not off, i have a bnc server connecting :)
[02:15:18] <Cork> but i'm not always in here
[02:15:23] <delboy1978uk> gunktion, when your code gets all sticky
[02:15:46] <danheberden> an by bnc... http://danheberden.com/share/1682cf2.pngd
[02:15:48] <danheberden> *and

[02:16:57] <danheberden> ok, you're in good graces bot-t
[02:17:21] <delboy1978uk> it was event.stopPropagation()
[02:17:24] <delboy1978uk> thanks
[02:17:25] <danheberden> Cork: i switched over to znc 1.0 beta or whatever
[02:17:27] <danheberden> cool shit

[02:17:39] <danheberden> propOgation
[02:18:14] <danheberden> *note* it's not actually spelled propogation
[02:18:48] <ekpyrotic> Guys, I'm trying to write a jQuery slider. The size of the slides resize with the browser window. What's the best way to go about that?
[02:19:26] <Cork> ekpyrotic: what do you mean?
[02:19:30] <Cork> you don't want it to resize?
[02:19:42] <ekpyrotic> Current in the html and css, I have a long slide composed of different pictures which are hidden from view -- the window is big enough to show the first slide.
[02:19:53] <ekpyrotic> Currenty*
[02:20:05] <danheberden> ah, a carousel
[02:20:18] <ekpyrotic> The pictures are width: 100%, meaning they resize w/ the browser.
[02:20:27] <danheberden> i hope you open source this
[02:20:31] <danheberden> since there aren't any out there
[02:20:45] <Nebros> danheberden i have this changing colors in my html, but the js reset it... thats my problem. here is my code of html and css:   <option class="{% cycle 'eins' 'zwei' %}">{{ column|cut:"'"|cut:"("|cut:")" }}</option>   .eins {background-color: #dcdcdc;} .zwei {background-color: #ffffff;}   you see, very simple. :D
[02:20:45] <danheberden> ekpyrotic: that's big!
[02:21:04] <ekpyrotic> danheberden: it's the header.
[02:21:05] <danheberden> Nebros: simple, but you're making classes based on the options
[02:21:14] <danheberden> Nebros: i'm saying you can do this with CSS
[02:21:27] <danheberden> Nebros: however, you don't seem to care about that, and don't want to google or use or understand what nth-child does
[02:21:35] <ekpyrotic> Is it best to alter the margin-left but the width of the browser window?
[02:21:42] <ekpyrotic> by the width*
[02:21:56] <danheberden> Nebros: so you will have to re-apply those classes that you're applying in whatever the fuck that language is via javascript
[02:22:18] <Nebros> i think i understand it, but for what is it, when js ignore my css? :(
[02:22:38] <danheberden> Nebros: it isn't - you're creating new elements without those classes
[02:22:47] <Nebros> its django of python
[02:23:16] <danheberden> this is why at 2:23am i should be sleeping, ugh
[02:23:40] <Nebros> 11:23 am is it here ^^
[02:28:08] <Nebros> danheberden, how have to look my html line? http://node86.co.uk/pastebin/axbh0/
[02:40:17] <BadCodSmell> I have some weirdness in jquery
[02:40:51] <BadCodSmell> I have some complicated code that adds an event to a dom element which later on I call trigger against
[02:41:00] <BadCodSmell> However the event does not register
[02:41:12] <BadCodSmell> The weirdness is that when I put in a break point just before trigger
[02:41:29] <BadCodSmell> It does register and the event is properly triggered
[02:41:45] <Cork> BadCodSmell: sounds like your seeing a race condition
[02:41:48] <BadCodSmell> Is that any possible common cause for something like this?
[02:42:23] <Cork> something is astronomically adding the listener, and your sometimes calling it before it exists
[02:42:23] <BadCodSmell> The callbacks should be one after the other if that's what you mean
[02:42:44] <BadCodSmell> It is possible
[02:42:47] <BadCodSmell> I'll check
[02:42:49] <Cork> pb your code if you want help
[02:42:56] <Cork> ?p
[02:42:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:43:39] <BadCodSmell> although very unlikely because I am pretty sure the dom element is added to the dom after the trigger because I pull it from the global dom change it then trigger and events are definitely added before it is added to the dom
[02:44:40] <BadCodSmell> I need some kind of a stack trace for this really
[02:45:01] <didiergm> I did not know you could attach an event to an element before it is added to the dom; Intuiitively I thought this would not work.
[02:45:18] <Cork> didiergm: sure you can
[02:45:18] <BadCodSmell> It actually does work
[02:45:30] <Cork> as long as the dom element exists it can have a listener
[02:45:56] <BadCodSmell> I have seen weirdness before where it seems like adding something to the dom isn't registered until the current js "thread" exits
[02:45:59] <Cork> (as all elements have a dom, they just might not have your primary dom as its parent :) )
[02:46:06] <BadCodSmell> (back to the main loop)
[02:46:06] <didiergm> even though it's 11.48am here, I can go to bed; I've learn something for today; thanks guys
[02:46:13] <lugzer> hi
[02:46:19] <Cork> BadCodSmell: that is async features
[02:46:29] <Cork> BadCodSmell: so again, that does sound like async problems
[02:47:04] <BadCodSmell> I could just put the thing in setTimeout(function(){stuff}, 0) but still don't really get it
[02:47:40] <Cork> BadCodSmell: ya, cause that would make that part async, and put it at the end of the async queue
[02:47:55] <BadCodSmell> Cork: If you mean there's two lines of execution, well I do have alot of callbacks and things, but the sequence as far as I can tell it valid, a than B then C always with no possibility for A C B
[02:48:07] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no not two lines
[02:48:13] <BadCodSmell> When you say async you mean internally to the js engine?
[02:48:18] <skython> Is there a simple selector to find a div by class AFTER a selector i currently have. The elements are not sharing the same parent. So it has to parse the whole DOM after my selector.
[02:48:19] <Cork> but there is a current stack and a queue
[02:48:49] <Cork> BadCodSmell: i mean javascript async, its a term for when the code execution isn't synchronous
[02:48:54] <BadCodSmell> Are you saying something on a queue could have a previous state from when it was added?
[02:49:06] <lugzer> hi guys, i'm checking if file exists using a simple snippet:  http://pastebin.com/eAs5bvmB - the image does NOT exist, and i'm getting a status of 200. why is that?
[02:49:15] <BadCodSmell> This part is synchronous though.
[02:49:41] <Cork> BadCodSmell: function() { print('1'); setTimeout(function() { print('2') }, 0); print('3') } will print 1 3 2
[02:49:54] <Cork> thats an example of async-ness
[02:49:59] <BadCodSmell> Cork: That's what I call two lines of execution
[02:50:05] <Cork> BadCodSmell: its not two lines
[02:50:13] <Cork> cause they don't execute at the same time
[02:50:20] <Cork> its still single threaded
[02:50:21] <BadCodSmell> The problem is here that I trace it through and as far as I can tell the order is gauranteed A B C
[02:50:29] <BadCodSmell> Right but it simulates multiple threads
[02:50:36] <Cork> and we can't help you until you show the code
[02:51:11] <BadCodSmell> If I just put console.log('A') at each position or something I think that will just solve it.
[02:51:18] <BadCodSmell> or confirm one or the other
[02:58:32] <jomofcw> Hello !
[02:58:40] <Novalgina2Fast> hi, there is a way to use the function click() two times? i need to click on a <div> element to make a menu visible, and to click again to make it hidden
[02:58:56] <ekpyrotic> Hey guys, I'm trying to get a very basic jQuery slider up and running. What is wrong w/ this? http://pastebin.com/yQLGPDxS
[02:59:05] <sn0lan> use an .is-active class on them and conrtol the visibility with css
[02:59:06] <jomofcw> For those who use jQuery BlockUI : Is there a way to get the blocked element in onBlock ? I can easily get it in unBlock but not in Block oO.
[02:59:11] <sn0lan> then just use toggleClass();
[02:59:50] <Novalgina2Fast> thanks
[03:01:18] <Afflicto> Hey all. I'm having some issues with .data(). I'm trying to set data for an object, when i console log data afterwards I get "undefined".
[03:02:29] <Afflicto> Here's pastebin: http://pastebin.com/93hy547i
[03:03:27] <ekpyrotic> sn)lan, was that to me?
[03:03:36] <ekpyrotic> sn0lan*
[03:03:44] <Cork> Afflicto: whats this?
[03:03:48] <sn0lan> ekpyrotic: yeah
[03:03:55] <Afflicto> Cork "this" is a jquery object
[03:03:59] <sn0lan> ekpyrotic: sorry, forgot to start it with your name
[03:03:59] <Cork> Afflicto: your sure?
[03:04:05] <Cork> aka, is it in a plugin?
[03:04:12] <Cork> cause else its a dom element
[03:04:14] <Afflicto> Cork: yea I'm writing a plugin
[03:04:18] * Cork nods
[03:04:34] <Cork> Afflicto: and this.data('key') is also undefined?
[03:04:41] <Afflicto> yea
[03:04:54] <Cork> heh...
[03:05:00] <AdamPDotty> and this.data?
[03:05:09] <Cork> Afflicto: are those two happening in the same function call?
[03:05:34] <Afflicto> Cork: I found the problem. I was calling my plugin with a selector that returned zero elements XD
[03:05:41] <BadCodSmell> It does indeed appear to be an async issue
[03:05:41] * Cork nods
[03:05:58] <Afflicto> I did $("form[name='']").myPlugin(); forgot to add the name lol :P
[03:06:09] <Cork> :)
[03:12:34] <jomofcw> For those who use jQuery BlockUI : Is there a way to get the blocked element in onBlock ? I can easily get it in unBlock but not in Block oO.
[03:13:46] <boytoy> hi
[03:14:16] <boytoy> say i wanna do a mobile slide-in-from-the-left menu like facebook and google+ - do you guys recommend making one from scratch or using something like http://jpanelmenu.com/?
[03:16:42] <ekpyrotic> So, now I've defined a function NextSlide() that slides the current image to the left, but how would I apply that to subsequent slides?
[03:17:07] <boytoy> it oughta be real simple right? like $("#menu_button").on("click", function() $("#menu", this).slideLeft();}); or whatever?
[03:17:25] <boytoy> i just dont understand why the dude went through so much trouble to put up http://jpanelmenu.com/ if the same thing can be done just by one line of jquery
[03:17:59] <boytoy> maybe it's so he had something to put on his portfolio at the cost of confusing the rest of the webdeveloping world?
[03:19:42] <ekpyrotic> boytoy, what if there's no event except load, and I want it to keep sliding?
[03:21:36] <krz> 'fooo_bar_'.replace('_', '-') returns fooo-bar_
[03:21:45] <krz> anyway i can return fooo-bar-
[03:21:55] <boytoy> ekpyrotic: hmm
[03:22:48] <Cork> ?eval 'fooo_bar_'.replace(/_/g, '-')
[03:22:49] <boytoy> krz: its probably only replacing the first hit by default
[03:22:54] <Cork> sigh
[03:22:57] <boytoy> cool
[03:23:00] <Cork> js> print('fooo_bar_'.replace(/_/g, '-'))
[03:23:10] <Cork> ...
[03:23:16] <Cork> the bots don't like me today T_T
[03:23:23] <b-ot> Cork: fooo-bar-
[03:23:44] <Novalgina2Fast> hi again, i need to make a menu appear when i click on a <div> element and disappear when i click again i'm using this code, but it doesn't work, in my opinion because the <div> element is not a button, how can i fix this? http://pastebin.com/TSLtidHC
[03:25:53] <Cork> Novalgina2Fast: the code for the div isn't included
[03:26:16] <Cork> and preferably use jsfiddle and make the code "live"
[03:26:18] <Cork> ?p
[03:26:23] <Cork> or right... its down...
[03:26:41] <Kasimir> Not really related to jquery, but does anyone know a good shopping cart module?
[03:27:07] <Cork> Kasimir: that would depend o the framework you want the module for; and ya its offtopic
[03:27:14] <boytoy> Kasimir: spree without a doubt
[03:27:15] <Cork> way offtopic
[03:29:02] <Kasimir> boytoy: thanks for that I'll check it out
[03:29:29] <Kasimir> Cork: I just want something flexible, and easy to implent, with easy customazation
[03:29:48] <Cork> Kasimir: ya, but normally shopping carts depends on the backend
[03:29:57] <Cork> and not so much on the front end
[03:30:16] <delboy1978uk> spree? whats the website
[03:30:34] <Cork> so just asking for a module without saying what server framework sounds kinda impossible to answer
[03:30:38] <Kasimir> Cork: well I'm open for everything really, not decided any backend for now
[03:31:12] <delboy1978uk> powered by ruby on rails? wtf get off this channel lol
[03:31:45] <Cork> well like i said...
[03:33:13] <Kasimir> cant really answer the backend question tho as I'm yet to decide
[03:33:45] <Kasimir> keeping my eyes open, might even do a custom backend if I dont find anything I like
[03:33:47] <Cork> well you at least have to specify the limitations; but like i said, this isn't really the channel for that kind of questions
[03:35:51] <Kasimir> Yeh I know, was just intrested in knowing opinions out there
[03:42:58] <Novalgina2Fast> really sorry to repeat myself but i can't figure it out, need menu that appear when i click on a <li> element and disappear when i click again http://pastebin.com/upTiXJH3
[03:46:20] <Cork> Novalgina2Fast: an id is more specific then a class, check so the id doens't overide the class for you
[03:46:39] <Cork> other then that it looks like that should work just fine
[03:46:42] <xec-> Cork++
[03:47:56] <EdwardIII> hey, how can i get my own content inside a dialog box's header? say, for example, i want a title that has some HTML in it. I can't set title: 'Hello <span>Edward!</span>' because the html gets escaped
[03:48:19] <EdwardIII> this is on jquery ui
[03:48:31] <Novalgina2Fast> it works! thanks a lot :D
[03:54:07] <EdwardIII> i tried appending my own <span class="ui-title">... into it using the open event, but it seems to remove the content? i just end up with a span containing &nbsp;
[04:03:11] <Cork> EdwardIII: i experienced having to fiddle with that WAY back
[04:03:39] <Cork> if my memory isn't failing me i was forced to fix it through extending the dialog plugin
[04:05:07] <EdwardIII> heh lovely

[04:47:53] <gotwig> hey folks
[04:48:24] <gotwig> is there actually a difference between dragging a div element, and clicking it? Can I differencate between that in my selector?

[04:58:40] <Teduardo> is there any way to smartly format email with jquery for display in a browser?
[04:58:47] <Teduardo> automatically, i should say
[05:15:33] <DukeDrake> hi
[05:16:19] <DukeDrake> what's the syntax for selecting an element with id AND class? $('#myid.myclass') ?
[05:17:02] <carpii> hi, whats the correct way to set the position of a floating div (position: absolute)?  Right now im using $("#div").offset(pageX, pageY)  but it seems to be literally offsetting the current position rather than setting it absolutely ?
[05:18:37] <delboy1978uk> try just .css('top',100) etc
[05:19:34] <SPYGAME> how do i attach a single event to a couple of ids without repeating the code
[05:20:55] <Nomikos> This should be supersimple: why doesn't this work? $('a').first().trigger('click');
[05:21:06] <shesek> DukeDrake, IDs should be unique across the entire document, thus what you're asking doesn't make sense
[05:21:21] <shesek> but yes, what you wrote should work
[05:21:33] <shesek> tho I see no reason one would need that
[05:22:35] <carpii> thanks delboy
[05:25:27] <robinsmidsrod> has anyone had issues with this kind of event trigger not firing on IE<9? $(window).on('keyup mouseup touchend mousemove touchmove scroll', function(e) {
[05:26:06] <robinsmidsrod> using jquery 1.7.2
[05:26:16] <amcsi_work> what's a good template system for jquery currently?
[05:26:47] <DukeDrake> shesek: sure ... but what if I want to alter an element with id, only if it also has a certain class?
[05:28:04] <g0nz0w> good morning. I am trying to debug some jquery that I use to add the value of a select on a form to a text box. It sets it fine, but when I check the text box via firebug, it shows the value="" and I can't figure out why
[05:30:12] <carpii> g0nz0w: youre using firebug console, or just the dom inspector?
[05:30:28] <DukeDrake> '#myid.myclass' doesn't work, somehow
[05:34:07] <DukeDrake> (ok, found error)
[05:34:46] <EdwardIII> hmm don't suppose there's a way to create a click event that *doesn't* propagate? at the moment i have to add e.stopPropagation on all child elements which seems less sexy
[05:35:29] <phrearch> hey
[05:35:46] <phrearch> anyone a suggestion for a drag library for jquery?
[05:37:15] <shesek> DukeDrake, ah, I see... that makes sense
[05:37:19] <shesek> what was the issue?
[05:39:13] <g0nz0w> carpii: yes, using firebug, tried setting a breakpoint, but it doesn't seem to stop, even tho the code appears to fire correctly
[05:39:29] <Liriel> is there something like a UserControl in jquery ?
[05:39:44] <carpii> g0nz, kinda hard to understand what youre referring to without seeing some code
[05:39:54] <carpii> what doest stop, wheres the breakpoint?
[05:43:43] <DukeDrake> shesek: wrong class XD
[05:46:35] <g0nz0w> carpii: I'm adding a .change(function(){} to a select box, which just does this:  $('#target-textbox').val(this.value);
[05:47:11] <g0nz0w> It works great, on screen, but when you inspect the target-textbox, it has the value="", instead of the value of the selectbox
[05:47:59] <carpii> what if you use firebug console and type $("#target-textbox").val() ?
[05:48:00] <g0nz0w> I will point out that I'm firing off some AHAH code as well, and I don't know if that's interfering. I'm not too familiar with the AHAH methods, so I'm not sure what to look for
[05:48:37] <carpii> ok, youre assigning youre event handler using .on( rather than .change(  ?
[05:49:25] <g0nz0w> when I type that in the console, I get back the value which I can see, so it's set apparently
[05:49:51] <g0nz0w> I am using the .change event
[05:50:11] <DEac-> hi
[05:50:38] <carpii> if the textbox is being dyanmically created via AHAH, you should probably use .on( to make sure the veent handler gets assigned each time
[05:51:32] <Liriel> I want to build a reuseable list that supports drag and drop and whatnot - is jquery the right place to put this ?
[05:52:02] <g0nz0w> carpii: no, the textbox is outside of any AHAH affected sections. It's always there. It's actually going to be a hidden element, but for now I have it set to a textbox so I can see the code
[05:52:15] <DEac-> i've a problem with 2px. somewhere, there is a call, that adds 2px to margin. i don't know where is this call. how i can find this call? i think, it's via jquery added (or by jquery?). i only know the result: <textare style="margin: 2px 0px; ..." .../>
[05:52:20] <delboy1978uk> absolutely liriel
[05:52:42] <Liriel> delboy1978uk: sry for the noobish question but where to start ?
[05:52:49] <g0nz0w> carpii: I meant so I can see the result of the code (while I'm developing and testing)
[05:53:01] <delboy1978uk> use jquery AND jquery ui
[05:53:04] <Liriel> delboy1978uk: is the thing I described a jquery plugin ?
[05:53:16] <delboy1978uk> create a ul with li's in it
[05:53:41] <carpii> g0n, i dont see the problem, sorry
[05:53:43] <delboy1978uk> then $('ul#id-of-ul').sortable(); should get you started
[05:53:48] <ekpyrotic> Any reason this won't work?
[05:53:49] <ekpyrotic> $("#text-strip").delay(1000).animate({ 'marginTop': '-260px' }, SlideSpeed ).delay(7000).animate({ 'marginTop': '0px' }, SlideSpeed );
[05:54:55] <Liriel> delboy1978uk: thx for the advice!
[05:55:06] <g0nz0w> carpii: thanks for trying. Do you know if there's another way to set the value or maybe "reinforce" the change?
[05:55:44] <delboy1978uk> liriel look here http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#entry-examples
[05:55:58] <delboy1978uk> try dragging the list irtems
[05:56:36] <carpii> $("#textarea").val("hello") should be all you need.  Check youre passing a valid string and not null
[05:56:56] <Liriel> loool
[05:57:08] <Liriel> delboy1978uk works perfectly!
[05:57:17] <delboy1978uk> nice n easy too!
[06:00:03] <codepython777> I have a web application which needs to scan a folder for all .jpg files inside a directory (recursively). I would like to do this without sending the entire folder to the server. Is this something that can be done with JS?
[06:00:20] <Liriel> delboy1978uk: so what is #sortable - an extension, a plugin ?
[06:00:58] <amcsi_work> what's a good template system for jquery currently?
[06:01:00] <E_mE> codepython777: are you wanting to read the users computer files/directory?
[06:01:17] <delboy1978uk> jquery UI is a bunch of awesomeness that extends jquery. download the js and css and thats you ready to rock!
[06:01:36] <delboy1978uk> obviously load the js AFTER loading jquery
[06:02:18] <carpii> codepython777: you cant arbitrarily read the local hard drive from clientside javascript (thankfully)
[06:02:25] <codepython777> E_mE: I want to be able to upload those files to the server. Indeed I want to read the files.
[06:02:27] <bibi23> hi,
[06:02:43] <bibi23> jquery guys
[06:02:56] <codepython777> carpii: clearly JS allows to read files from a directory. I just want to select all the jpeg files and read them.
[06:03:19] <bibi23> do you know how I can add a delete icon on the top-right of an image?
[06:04:23] <Lianzinho> hi people, how could I rise a breakpoint specifically on a css property change? I know I can rise on "attribute" change, but how to specify which one? I'm using Chrome Developer Tools
[06:05:36] <delboy1978uk> does chrome not have an irc? cant help you with that
[06:07:00] <delboy1978uk> i dont know how to make my ajax request FAIL properly http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/h5kXE/
[06:07:14] <delboy1978uk> just want the message in a div
[06:08:11] <delboy1978uk> i've put two fail sections to try both ways but neither work
[06:09:23] <delboy1978uk> should i be using .ajax or .post?
[06:11:24] <carpii> delboy: its working fine
[06:11:35] <carpii> but you should use error instead of fail in the inner block.. http://jsfiddle.net/h5kXE/2/
[06:11:52] <carpii> and because its running on jsfiddle it seems to take 10 seconds or so before it really fails
[06:12:05] <carpii> so click run and then wait
[06:12:08] <delboy1978uk> yeah jsfiddle is painfully slow these days
[06:16:09] <delboy1978uk> ah i get it now, the response from the server is an object so all i needed was msg.statusText
[06:41:32] <dblosevn> delboy1978uk: if the request fails you wont get a msg in the reponse
[06:49:11] <darvein> hi everybody! :)
[06:50:07] <amcsi_work> what's a good template system for jquery currently?
[06:51:39] <Nomikos> amcsi_work: haven't used it yet, but hearing good things about mustache
[06:57:01] <amcsi_work> thanks!
[06:57:55] <Nebros> option:nth-child(2n){ background-color: #ccc; }   <--- this function work,but not in ie9. what can i do?
[06:58:44] <Nomikos> try 'backgroundColor' or 'background-color' (with the quotes)
[06:59:02] <Nomikos> and quote the value for good measure
[06:59:14] <Nomikos> s/value/color value/
[06:59:28] <dblosevn> Nebros: $('option').eq(n).css('backgroundColor', '#ccc')
[07:00:28] <dblosevn> if ie seems to be having a problem with the nth-child seletor
[07:00:55] <Nebros> i hate ie -.-
[07:01:06] <dblosevn> As do I
[07:01:35] <dblosevn> Is there an event to listen to for failed images?
[07:03:11] <carpii> yes
[07:03:16] <dblosevn> im doing something like this now
[07:03:18] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/109
[07:03:35] <dblosevn> everytime an ajax request fails but it seems really hacky
[07:04:15] <dblosevn> *everytime an ajax request completes that pulls content into the dom
[07:04:37] <carpii> im just looking to see how i did it
[07:04:53] <dblosevn> id rather be able to listen to an event instead of having to wait on a timeout
[07:05:00] <dblosevn> :-)
[07:05:18] <murr4y> hi! is it expected behavior that setting .attr('checked', true) on a radio input should not trigger 'change' event on it?
[07:06:11] <Nebros> dblosevn: how i have to use $('option').eq(n).css('backgroundColor', '#ccc') ?
[07:06:51] <dblosevn> murr4y: .prop('checked', true) and i dont think that will trigger change
[07:07:18] <carpii> dblosevn:  its just $("img.subset").on('error', function() {
[07:07:23] <dblosevn> Nebros: id have to see your code
[07:07:44] <murr4y> dblosevn: all right. i'll check out prop too, thanks
[07:08:14] <dblosevn> how bout $('#ajax-content').on('error', 'img', function() {
[07:08:39] <dblosevn> so i only have to bind once?
[07:08:51] <dblosevn> or does error not bubble
[07:08:53] <carpii> i imagine thatd work sure
[07:09:12] <carpii> im actually doing it via onerror="some_oldskool_handler()"
[07:09:16] <carpii> but im on an older version of jquery
[07:09:25] <dblosevn> ya im using latest
[07:09:53] <dblosevn> i try to only dev new stuff with the newest stable stuff :-)
[07:10:22] <carpii> same, ive a big old legacy codebase to worry about though :p
[07:10:56] <Nebros> dblosevn: i did not really understand what i have to do. im new in programming :(
[07:12:30] <dblosevn> ?demo @ Nebros
[07:12:30] <b-ot> Nebros: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:16:18] <didiergm> jqm: trying to trap a click event on <ul><li><a> .... listview to either stop the processing ot let it go; I tried placing an event on the anchor and use preventDefault and stopPropagation no luck, what ma I missing
[07:16:41] <delboy1978uk> for all you IE haters: http://www.saveie6.com/
[07:16:58] <johnpcamara> didiergm - what event did you use?
[07:17:15] <johnpcamara> (i.e., click, vclick, vmouseup, etc)
[07:17:33] <didiergm> $(document).on ('click', 'classselector of anchor' ....
[07:17:54] <didiergm> this on the pageinit event
[07:18:04] <niels__> on a callback i want to display a message: 'settings saved' for instance. I want it to show for ~5 secs then disapear. if i do .show().delay(5000).fadeOut(); it won't be shown a second time its triggered. any clues?
[07:19:18] <didiergm> johnpcamara $(document).on ('click', 'classselector of anchor' .... in pageinit event
[07:19:21] <delboy1978uk> member:niels__ pastie or jsfiddle your code
[07:19:40] <carpii> I think fadeOut() sets display to none once its done. Try using .css('display', 'block') when you next show it
[07:20:31] <dblosevn> You have been mislead by a vocal minority and are using chrome, which is clearly an inferior web browser to IE6. Please switch to IE6 and sign our petition.
[07:20:44] <dblosevn> seriously this guy has got to be smoking crack
[07:20:59] <niels__> delboy1978uk: http://pastebin.com/g4GiwDa8
[07:21:12] <wunnle> Hello.
[07:21:16] <niels__> dblosevn: i think it's a joke ;)
[07:21:18] <dblosevn> chrome  is a way better browser then IEx
[07:21:33] <johnpcamara> didiergm hmmm. if it's a raw click it should work fine. only thoughts are that either another event is getting hit first and letting it through, or it's not hitting your handler at all (maybe a bad selector). example code?
[07:22:44] <carpii> IE needs to just die
[07:22:47] <carpii> preferably in pain
[07:23:00] <johnpcamara> IE10 isn't so bad :)
[07:23:09] <carpii> maybe, but i dont forgive it for past sins :)
[07:23:15] <delboy1978uk> niels_ that looks fine, i take it that part works ok
[07:23:25] <delboy1978uk> dont even touch ie10
[07:23:35] <dblosevn> lmao Unfortunately some of your answers were incompatible with proper IE6 usage which means that we werenâ€™t able to provide you with a download link.
[07:23:39] <delboy1978uk> if we develop for it then the vicious circle continues
[07:23:41] <niels__> delboy1978uk: it does, but the text stays.. i need it to disapear after a couple of seconds, and reappear if someone triggers the 'save' ajax
[07:23:51] <delboy1978uk> my website stops you from visiting if you have ie
[07:24:00] <johnpcamara> delboy1978uk "don't even touch ie10" - is that a tablet pun?
[07:24:09] <delboy1978uk> lol it is now
[07:24:17] <johnpcamara> :D
[07:24:55] <Brodingo> can you name one thing wrong with IE10?
[07:25:08] <Gho5t> dev tools suck ass

[07:26:49] <Brodingo> wunnle you need to delegate to a parent element, check the second example
[07:26:50] <delboy1978uk> niels__ i've literally just had to write something very similar http://pastie.org/6244807
[07:27:11] <delboy1978uk> my error message div is actually a Bootstrap alert box
[07:27:20] <wunnle> Brodingo: thanks!

[07:29:25] <carpii> just add them
[07:29:27] <delboy1978uk> regex? black magic!
[07:29:32] <atomiku> Hello jquer! :)
[07:29:38] <carpii> but i think youll need to escape the .  like \.
[07:29:38] <delboy1978uk> with a name like yours we should be asking you lol
[07:29:53] <johnpcamara> ha
[07:29:56] <atomiku> Just a quick question about jQuery mobile. How can I alter the default ajax from behavior? I would like to run a function/callback instead of redirecting to the ajax/success page?
[07:29:56] <Nomikos> black_warlock: inside the square brackets they don't need to be escaped, outside use a slash
[07:30:02] <black_warlock> inside parenthesis ?
[07:30:10] <carpii> ah yeah, thats more like it
[07:30:27] <black_warlock> this.value.match(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g /_/./, ?

[07:31:58] <Nomikos> black_warlock: and the ^ at the start makes them all /not/ match, is that what you need?
[07:32:07] <hadifarnoud> how can I pass the value of a checkbox to another one? like input value  $('#user-pdmr-field').val($('#user-pdmr').val());
[07:32:22] <niels__> delboy1978uk: i did it like this $(".profile-form-message").text('Gemt!').fadeIn('fast').fadeOut(3000);
[07:33:03] <johnpcamara> atomiku can you be a little more specific? are you looking to hijack a specific link and do something differently?
[07:33:18] <black_warlock> yes
[07:33:20] <didiergm> johnpcamara -  $(document).on('click', '.mainmenu', function(e) {alert('clicked'); e.prevenDefault();  e.stopPropagation();
[07:33:20] <didiergm>                 alert('hello')}); I see the clicked alert, then new page displays and I never get the Hello alert ??????
[07:33:20] <didiergm>            
[07:33:35] <black_warlock> but doesnt work Nomikos
[07:33:55] <Nomikos> black_warlock: make a simplified jsfiddle with what you need
[07:34:04] <johnpcamara> didiergm preventDefault is spelled wrong
[07:34:09] <atomiku> johnpcamara: yes, it seems that after the form has submitted via ajax, it redirects me to the page of which it has submitted to
[07:34:13] <Brodingo> hadifarnoud yes that should work
[07:34:15] <black_warlock> its a simple check on input keyup
[07:34:17] <black_warlock> one sec
[07:34:25] <johnpcamara> didiergm you're getting a js error, and then the link goes through so you don't see it in the console
[07:34:26] <atomiku> johnpcamara: instead of doing that, I would like to run a callback function. cause, see i dont need to redirect, instead I need to.. lets sayâ€¦ hide a div
[07:34:40] <hadifarnoud> Brodingo: for input fields it does. for checkbox doesn't
[07:35:18] <scalex000> http://jsfiddle.net/5znRU/
[07:35:29] <atomiku> johnpcamara: I feel that I need some sort of aftersubmit or success bind. then return false within the function, which would hopefully stop the redirect
[07:35:41] <Brodingo> hadifarnoud you want the checked state?
[07:35:48] <didiergm> johnpcamara: bingo! thanks  a bunch. I could have spent all day on that one as I had no error in chrome's console
[07:35:52] <Brodingo> value is different
[07:36:42] <johnpcamara> didiergm np! i've hit that scenario many times myself, then hours later realizing it was such a silly fix
[07:36:52] <hadifarnoud> I know how to get checked state. $('#user-pdmr-field').is(':checked') Brodingo. I want to pass check state from #user-pdmr to #user-pdmr-field
[07:37:46] <black_warlock> Nomikos http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/LzXFf/4/
[07:37:48] <delboy1978uk> why dont you blank the text after the fadeOut? niels__?
[07:38:16] <niels__> delboy1978uk: .val('') or what?
[07:38:25] <johnpcamara> atomiku others may have a different experience, but a lot of times with jqm i just handle form submits entirely myself (though a post call with a form.serialize()). i'll handle it on the submit, then prevent it from submitting the actual page
[07:38:35] <delboy1978uk> what is the element?
[07:38:51] <atomiku> johnpcamara: yes sir, i was just looking into this option. seems like its the best way. $.post("/forms/requestProcessor.php", form1Var.serialize(), function(data){
[07:38:53] <niels__> delboy1978uk: span or div, whatever.. right now its a span, doesnt matter though
[07:38:56] <ngsilverman> hadifarnoud: attr( "checked" )
[07:39:08] <delboy1978uk> .html() to change the content
[07:39:22] <Brodingo> hadifarnoud http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/BvjLs/
[07:39:28] <hadifarnoud> thanks
[07:40:32] <johnpcamara> atomiku exactly. i have scenarios where i'm redirecting after a submit as well, and with the default jqm submits they stick you with the form action url, which may not be what you want. $.post certainly solves it just as well (and gives you a bit more control if you want to do things like file uploads with jq-transport or whatever)
[07:40:36] <Nomikos> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/LzXFf/5/ - all I did was add '.,_' to both regex strings, now they're allowed
[07:41:04] <atomiku> johnpcamara: it wouldn't be such a bad idea for the next version of jquery mobile to allow you to hook into a form error and form success event
[07:41:19] <atomiku> johnpcamara: like how you can .refresh(), etc etcâ€¦
[07:41:46] <atomiku> $('#some_ajax_form').ajaxFormSuccess(function() { return false here if you dont want to redirect; });
[07:42:09] <black_warlock> hum i dunno why wasnt working for me Nomikos
[07:42:11] <atomiku> I was going to write/release a plugin but I couldn't figure out where the AJAX form handlers were in the jquery mobile source, so I am pretty much clueless
[07:42:29] <black_warlock> is it not better to set the regex in a var ?
[07:42:36] <black_warlock> Nomikos
[07:43:19] <niels__> delboy1978uk: here's how im doing it, it works.. looks fine? http://pastebin.com/scwFTBi8
[07:43:26] <Lianzinho> hahaha, I think AJAX is very esoteric yet. I always think I understood it, but when I'm going to use it I have to read tons of material again...
[07:43:47] <Nomikos> black_warlock: sorry was afk a sec, yeah you could
[07:44:09] <Nomikos> I don't know too much about regex in a js context though
[07:44:11] <johnpcamara> atomiku true, that could be nice. i'm not sure i've kept a single jqmobile form with default behavior, unless i was doing ajax=false, so having more control could be good
[07:44:43] <johnpcamara> atomiku you could always request it :)
[07:44:52] <chilversc> Lianzinho: what's esoteric about it?
[07:45:05] <kam187-rMBP> hey guys, on a multipage jquery page, is it worth buffering all the often used tags in a global on page load, or should i just buffer them in my functions that reference them alot?
[07:45:28] <chilversc> Lianzinho: browser submits a request to the server, response comes back, only difference to fetching the page/css/images is the request is initiated by code
[07:46:15] <Lianzinho> chilversc: it was never very clear to me how to set up the thing that will send stuff to your request... I always get confused...
[07:46:39] <johnpcamara> chilversc maybe meaning the actual XMLHTTPRequest itself. which is not the most straightforward of apis
[07:46:39] <hXm> using $.get i can call a cgi file, wait until it ends and read the data, but what about if i want read the data as fast and it comes'
[07:46:56] <Gho5t_> cgi
[07:46:58] <Gho5t_> nie
[07:47:01] <Gho5t_> *nice
[07:47:13] <hXm> i have a cgi that makes a long process and sends to output some relevant information
[07:47:29] <hXm> i want to read it, not wait until the process end
[07:47:33] <hXm> can take some minutes
[07:48:10] <chilversc> johnpcamara: yeah, async code using callbacks can get quite gnarly, fortunatly the jquery promise smooths a lot of that over
[07:48:55] <Gho5t> Lianzinho: you pass it an object such as { userId: 1, name: 'joe' }
[07:49:02] <Gho5t> or a string such as 'foo'
[07:49:17] <johnpcamara> hXm you won't be able to do that with just a standard GET, without using some other techniques/libraries
[07:49:42] <hXm> but is still possible? how
[07:49:57] <Lianzinho> Gho5t: a simple return would make the work done?
[07:50:07] <Gho5t> what
[07:50:25] <Gho5t> not sure what you mean
[07:50:51] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[07:51:41] <Lianzinho> Gho5t: hehhehe, sorry I meant, just returning the object would be suffice?
[07:51:56] <Lianzinho> *would suffice
[07:51:59] <Gho5t> sending the object yes
[07:52:21] <Gho5t> view your network tab in chrome to view the request
[07:52:31] <Gho5t> you'll see it's just like having them in the querystring
[07:52:48] <pmercado> I'm using this plugin: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar  is possible to extend that plugin to add custom methods ?
[07:52:58] <Gho5t> of course you can use $.post as well
[07:53:34] <pmercado> because is possible to extends jquery as it using: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/  but for an already created plugin is possible ?
[07:55:55] <Lianzinho> Gho5t: so, if using a PHP script as the url target, I could use $.post to send data do the script,  get the data in _POST, (inside the script), then, do my stuff and receive the return from the script? Is that the general workflow?
[07:56:42] <Gho5t> right
[07:57:44] <Gho5t> you'll generally either want to either just return some JSON, or a snippet of HTML
[07:57:50] <pmercado> should I use http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ "Provide public access to secondary functions as applicable"   ??
[07:58:09] <carpii> php has json_encode()
[07:59:54] <pmercado> yes? no?
[08:00:46] <johnpcamara> hXm sorry gotta go, but a couple things to think about are whether your server is even capable of streaming
[08:00:52] <Nomikos> Lianzinho: this is a sample generic ajax.php script, http://mech.cx/tools/functions.php?id=190 where 'act' decides what needs doing
[08:00:59] <johnpcamara> hXm start there, because if it isn';t you'll need to take a different approach
[08:01:10] <Nomikos> The response data is always of a similar form, so you can reuse it easily
[08:02:02] <wunnle> Brodingo: I'm back, are you still there?
[08:02:12] <Brodingo> sup
[08:02:38] <raj> is there any way to make a clickoutside not trigger if I'm clicking things in the console?
[08:02:50] <wunnle> I really don't get how .on is gonna solve my problem
[08:04:03] <Lianzinho> Nomikos: why echo and not return? At the end?
[08:04:15] <wunnle> Brodingo: my code is there http://jsfiddle.net/gccqh/. first click function works, but second does not.
[08:05:03] <Brodingo> wunnle yeah so you need to select a parent element of those spans and use .on()
[08:05:18] <whoDat> trying to figure out how to attach zclip to a dialog button...it normally attaches to a link element like $('a#copy-description').zclip({ ... how would i attach it within the anonymous function of a dialog button? code here ( doesnt work ) : http://pastebin.com/tbPpgacw
[08:05:24] <Nomikos> Lianzinho: it needs to end up in the body of the resulting page, not sure what return would do
[08:05:26] <Novalgina2Fast> Hi, I'm trying to change the header when the page scroll down, how i can do that? i've written this function http://pastebin.com/0fQNtDaQ
[08:05:48] <Brodingo> wunnle or you could just have them both next to each other, and toggle their visibility
[08:06:09] <Nomikos> Lianzinho: to be sure, the script is sending the results back as _text_, it's up to JavaScript to parse it back into an object
[08:07:24] <wunnle> Brodingo: I was writing the second thing you mentioned first, but i thought this way it would be more clean. Thanks again.
[08:07:26] <Lianzinho> Nomikos: I see, probably returning would be sending encapsulated in a PHP variable format or something like that? Maybe?
[08:07:51] <Brodingo> wunnle i use this for simple toggling http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/jgtyB/
[08:09:28] <Nomikos> Lianzinho: I daren't guess :-) I know return can be used to set values inside PHP from included scripts ($foo = include 'bar.php';) but it's uncommon
[08:10:54] <Nomikos> Lianzinho: a quick test suggests using PHP's return would leave the body blank
[08:11:44] <carpii> yeah return just returns it to the callee (in PHP). You need to write data to the response stream either with echo "hello"; or echo json_encode($myarray);
[08:12:13] <Lianzinho> carpii: check =D
[08:12:19] <Nomikos> 'callee' I have to use that word more often
[08:12:21] <Lianzinho> makes total sense
[08:12:34] <Lianzinho> uehauhea
[08:13:01] <wunnle> Brodingo: so what is the main differance between, .click(function() and .on({   click: function(){?
[08:13:07] <delboy1978uk> niels__ u still there
[08:13:09] <Lianzinho> rather sophisticated
[08:13:41] <Brodingo> wunnle the key is selecting a parent first then delegating to elements that may or may not be there
[08:14:08] <Nomikos> wunnle: one difference is that .on() also works on dynamically added elements, if a target argument was given
[08:14:28] <Nomikos> $(document).on('click', '.newElement', function() { ..
[08:15:43] <wunnle> Alright!
[08:21:36] <whoDat> trying to figure out how to attach zclip to a dialog button...it normally attaches to a link element like $('a#copy-description').zclip({ ... how would i attach it within the anonymous function of a dialog button? code here ( doesnt work ) : http://pastebin.com/tbPpgacw
[08:26:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hi
[08:26:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have an ajax call
[08:26:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> which executes a php script
[08:26:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but this script has to generate Jquery code with another ajax call in it
[08:27:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is this a proper way to do? To echo Jquery code in the php script that's called with an ajax call?
[08:32:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone?
[08:33:10] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: why are you sending back new code?
[08:33:26] <Nomikos> ecky--ptang-zoob: I'd try to have PHP just send the data with which jQuery can then decide to make another call
[08:33:47] <monteith> i think the proper way would be the php script sending a response back and interpreting the response from there
[08:34:19] <Nomikos> Or if it's the same server, PHP could already fetch the data for that second call and send that, too
[08:45:15] <carpii> you could just use $("hidden_div").load("http://my_script.php"); and itll grab the script and run it locally
[08:45:53] <carpii> but it sounds a clumsy design
[08:46:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> NoiseEee: you have an example of that? Not sure what you have in mind
[08:46:08] <darkfrog> hey guys, I need to display a "Saved" message on the screen, but I'd like it to be just a floating div that displays a message for a few seconds and then disappears...is there something like that already available or do I need to write it?
[08:46:26] <darkfrog> ...it would be used for simple feedback messages
[08:46:50] <carpii> show the floating div, then use SetTimeout to wait for 5 seconds, then div.fadeOut()
[08:46:56] <carpii> its pretty trivial to write
[08:47:47] <darkfrog> carpii: indeed, but styling, managing corner-cases, and DRY tells me to check to see if there's already a nice option already available. :)
[08:49:25] <carpii> ok well in the simplest case, look at jQuery ui
[08:50:05] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:50:53] <BadCodSmell> I have an element with .bind("blur", function) but calling .blur() on it doesn't appear to work, is this expected or is there something wrong?
[08:51:08] <BadCodSmell> same for keyup
[08:52:12] <BadCodSmell> The docs say that it is
[08:52:26] <BadCodSmell> The element is display none, could this have any impact?
[08:56:59] <treeprogram> Hi, I'm using $.post to send data to PHP, then redirecting to PHP, but for some reason PHP doesn't pick it up
[08:57:00] <slick-> can I superscript the rights reserved symbol inside <title>?
[08:57:37] <treeprogram> I'm using       window.location.replace("login.php"); to redirect. Are there any common problems with PHP failing to receive the variables passed by $.post?
[08:59:40] <dblosevn> grr svn merge -r HEAD:308 ./ should roll back my WC to rev 308 right?
[09:00:16] <mlr> treeprogram: why are you "redirecting" to php? is that after you've parsed the ajax response from $.post?
[09:01:00] <treeprogram> mlr, I don't actually need an ajax response from $.post. I just want to pass data to PHP, and then go to the PHP page
[09:01:31] <treeprogram> sorry I misunderstood I think. The PHP would then parse the data passed from $.post.
[09:01:36] <mlr> are you expecting the post vars to be available on the page you redirected to?
[09:01:43] <mlr> if so, that's not going to work
[09:02:10] <mlr> once you redirect, you've issued another request, the post vars are gone
[09:02:19] <treeprogram> but the PHP page I land on after the redirect doesn't have any data passed by $.post
[09:02:55] <mlr> yes, because that data is sent to the URL you specify in $.post.  Once you redirect, you are issuing a GET request
[09:03:11] <treeprogram> mlr yes I'm expecting the post vars to be available (e.g. "echo $_POST["username"];" should display username
[09:03:21] <treeprogram> mlr I see
[09:03:43] <treeprogram> any way I use post to send the data and then see the data I just sent to PHP, on the PHP page?
[09:05:15] <mlr> well, you could have the script you $.post to store them in a session
[09:05:21] <mlr> or you could have the ajax response return the values
[09:05:27] <mlr> then just update the page with jquery
[09:06:38] <treeprogram> mlr I don't know what I changed, but one hour ago, the vars I passed form the jquery page were displaying on the PHP page. I can't figure out why
[09:06:54] <treeprogram> so I figure there must be a way
[09:07:24] <slick-> can I superscript the rights reserved symbol inside <title>?
[09:08:29] <BadCodSmell> Why would $('#something').blur(function(){console.log('blurrrrg');}); then later $('#something').blur() not work?
[09:09:07] <treeprogram> maybe it has to do with sessions, as I start a session on the PHP page
[09:09:11] <treeprogram> I'll check that
[09:11:27] <treeprogram> no that couldn't possibly be it..
[09:12:07] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: because event handlers are really supposed to be for users, not script
[09:12:35] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: $('#something').blur(function() { someFunction(); });   then after you blur, just call someFunction()
[09:13:13] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: i think though that your code would work with $('#something').trigger('blur')
[09:14:24] <Gho5t> what's the difference between .trigger('blur') and .blur() ?
[09:15:05] <NoWired> Gho5t, with "trigger" is you who makes the action
[09:15:31] <Gho5t> what
[09:15:45] <Gho5t> I can call $('#foo').click() and it is me who is making the action
[09:15:46] <Gho5t> no?
[09:16:27] <NoWired> this is something that happens when you make a "click" on the element with "foo" id
[09:16:57] <Gho5t> no
[09:16:59] <Gho5t> well yes
[09:17:00] <NoWired> if you make .trigger('click'), you make this "click"
[09:17:11] <Gho5t> but you are aware you can make it click by calling .click() in your code as well
[09:17:14] <NoWired> without clicking the element
[09:17:28] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: you should use .trigger() to fake user events
[09:17:30] <BadCodSmell> .trigger('blur') does not work either, I tried that
[09:17:44] <Gho5t> NoiseEee: ok but why not just .blur()?
[09:17:48] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: and you should be using .on() to set you handlers, none of this $(field).blur()
[09:17:57] <BadCodSmell> This is someone else's script, I can see it addingthe events to the element with bind but it's just not possible apparently to trigger those events
[09:18:05] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: that will certainly blur the element, but it won't fire any handlers associated with it
[09:18:14] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: event handlers are for users
[09:18:29] <Gho5t> ok
[09:20:08] <BadCodSmell> Blur works if I have it selected
[09:20:59] <BadCodSmell> So I need to find out if I can focus it programmatically
[09:23:16] <BadCodSmell> .focus doesn't work
[09:23:16] <b-ot> BadCodSmell: @work: RT @LS_Links: Honest Movie Trailers: Skyfall by Screen Junkies http://t.co/C0Ti0Gqq
[09:24:15] <BadCodSmell> perhaps you should ban that thing
[09:26:27] <ajacom> hi .. i'm using bootstrap-tour.js to make a product tour with "popovers". this is my script: http://pastebin.com/vHzftiE5. the problem i have is that in step 2,  $('#tour-create').click() isn't working, perhaps because the script is inserting the html into the DOM live... so i tried to add that script to the onShow: event (L:26) to make sure the html is loaded, but still nothing. Suggestions ?
[09:29:34] <mlr> ajacom:  try using  .on('click', function() {....   ?
[09:31:42] <ajacom> mlr, nope :/
[09:37:11] <BadCodSmell> No matter what I do trigger just doesn't work
[09:37:19] <BadCodSmell> is there a way someone could disable it for an element?
[09:40:03] <Gho5t> are you sure it's even bound
[09:40:25] <Gho5t> try console.logging the jquery wrapped element
[09:40:38] <BadCodSmell> Definitely
[09:40:48] <BadCodSmell> Can scope mess it up at all?
[09:41:12] <BadCodSmell> $(document) works
[09:41:18] <BadCodSmell> I'll just use that for messaging
[09:42:14] <basiclaser> hi guys
[09:45:27] <onenine90> Hey guys. I have an element A on a page that when I click, it sets element B css display = block. I want it so when I click anywhere EXCEPT for that element, it sets element B to display = none
[09:46:11] <onenine90> The problem I run into when using the body tag to do this is that body is the whole page so it displays none no matter what I click
[09:47:36] <lolwhut> onenine90: Yeah was going to say put an .on on the body, but I think you've got to give .on the context of the 'a' element, and if/when it's actually fired off the 'a' element, set display: block, then preventDefault/stop the bubbling?
[09:47:38] <onenine90> Nevermind i figured it out sorry
[09:47:48] <lolwhut> D'oh.
[09:47:53] <lolwhut> How'd you swing it?
[09:48:34] <onenine90> Question for you lolwhut . An onclick of an element is processed before the onclick of the body right?
[09:55:21] <lolwhut> I'm still learning this myself, but as I understand you bind an .on to body but you can give it a 'selector' (in your case 'a') to react from, then make sure your anonymous function takes an argument for the event, then check the event.target to see if it's an 'a', and if it is then display:block and stopPropagation(), otherwise set display:none.
[09:55:26] <lolwhut> [http://api.jquery.com/on/]
[09:56:09] <lolwhut> Actually your use-case may want to omit the 'a' selector - 'cause you want to hide it on any other element.click.
[10:14:51] <onenine90> How can I get a body onclick event to run before an element onclick event?
[10:16:09] <phillipadsmith> Displaying my complete ignorance (intentional, I swear!) of the asynchronous web, I've run into this problem (using getJSON the elements I'm appending to a list are in response order, not request order): http://jsfiddle.net/phillipadsmith/rvPCs/  Suggestions for appending in request order appreciated. :)
[10:21:57] <ekpyrotic> Guys, I have a problem w/ a simply carousel I'm designing. I have a strip of images. I have a SlideLeft() function, which changes the margin-left on the strip by the width of 1 image.
[10:22:31] <ekpyrotic> Then I have a ReturnSlider() function, which sets the margin-left back the 0.

[10:22:49] <lolwhut> phillipadsmith: a few ways.  You could always chain everything and apply a deferred, so that each index doesn't get requested until the previous one has returned.
[10:22:57] <bil`> philhutchinson: gather all your data and sort it before you render the responses
[10:23:11] <lolwhut> phillipadsmith: the second way is to give all the UL's IDs and only assign them to the correct ID.
[10:23:35] <lolwhut> phillipadsmith: and as a bonus, there's a third way, as described by bil`.
[10:23:41] <phillipadsmith> lolwhut: performance implications of each?
[10:23:47] <ekpyrotic> I have a conditional that counts the number of sliders, and performs ReturnSlider() once it has reached the end.
[10:24:28] <ekpyrotic> But after returning to the beginning, it quickly rushed back to the end of the slider, and continues sliding from there.
[10:24:30] <phillipadsmith> bil`: I was thinking of that too, i.e., stick each response object into an associative array or something?
[10:24:52] <bil`> yea and then you can use a sorting function to order it however you like
[10:24:53] <lolwhut> Chaining requests could slow it down a little, as each would wait for the previous, but the user experience would see each story render as the eye reads (top-bottom).
[10:25:06] <ekpyrotic> Demo is here: http://mailmymp.com/1994group/
[10:25:36] <phillipadsmith> bil`: ah, like sort on the storyDate property or something?
[10:25:40] <lolwhut> phillipadsmith: whereas assigning them to their own IDs would mean you can request all at once and then it's up to the browser and server as to how many requests are made and responded to at once.
[10:26:29] <bil`> you can just sort using that index var you have
[10:26:42] <bil`> anyway gotta jet out. good luck
[10:26:46] <ekpyrotic> Any ideas?
[10:26:50] <phillipadsmith> lolwhut, bil`: in an ideal scenario, I'm only going to request the first few stories and then offer the user a way to request more â€¦ in that scenario, can you think of any downsides on any of the above (chaining vs. gathering and sorting, etc.?)
[10:34:55] <scriptraptor> Hi guys, what's the best way to turn "10px" into 10 when I'm requesting a variable from .css()
[10:36:04] <scriptraptor> nm  just realised i can parseInt
[10:36:07] <scriptraptor> ignore me :D
[10:38:58] <basiclaser> hey guys can you tell me why the div isn't accepting the user input? http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/EsFGZ/
[10:39:04] <meelu> whats the best method to use where i can post id of something and return values untill one of them is a certain value then show message
[10:39:11] <meelu> like a progress
[10:42:53] <shoky> basiclaser: because 1> you're taking the val from the submit button. 2> you didnt set any event handler. 3> you didnt include jquery
[10:43:06] <shoky> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/EsFGZ/4/
[10:45:34] <basiclaser> thanks shoky ! I'm mega noob

[11:17:44] <freeed> Ugh.. just noticed the new jQuery website for docs.. so difficult to find anything now
[11:18:04] <freeed> Can't even locate the arguments for methods, i.e. .ajax()
[11:19:37] <say2joe> In google chrome, you can type api.jquery.com [spacebar] and enter a keyword ("ajax").
[11:19:50] <say2joe> (you can type that in the address bar)
[11:21:41] <onenine90> I'm having a lot of trouble getting these dropdowns to disappear. I really need them to display:none if a user clicks anywhere away from them while they are open (display:block)
[11:21:42] <freeed> say2joe, thanks for the tip.. I was previously adding search keywords to do that
[11:21:42] <onenine90> http://habibtees.com/product/bebsi/
[11:21:53] <onenine90> Can someone please offer any advice?
[11:22:24] <onenine90> This is not my work I am trying to help a friend
[11:22:36] <onenine90> I personally would have used a select & option elements
[11:23:05] <Catalin-> onenine90 Are you using JS to show the dropdown menu on hover?
[11:23:15] <onenine90> On click of the <th>
[11:23:19] <onenine90> not hover
[11:23:27] <Catalin-> Oh yes, noticed now.
[11:23:41] <onenine90> It's such a sloppy implementation of a dropdown
[11:23:58] <onenine90> But I haven't time to rewrite it as this was supposed to be like a 5 minute fix
[11:28:21] <Catalin-> onenine90 Check the 3rd answer from : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[11:34:59] <goddard> if a page is loaded with ajax for some reason it doesn't use the $(document).ready(function()
[11:35:17] <onenine90> Catalin-: looking into this thank you
[11:35:17] <goddard> is there any other way to ensure it is loaded?
[11:36:16] <onenine90> Catalin-: the answer with the click event of document ?
[11:36:35] <onenine90> damn this might be perfect
[11:36:58] <Catalin-> onenine90 Yes, though an Event Listener on the whole document just .. stings my brain.
[11:37:09] <onenine90> I knowwww
[11:37:35] <onenine90> why is your nick a brand name for a thermosetting plymer popular in the 1930s cata
[11:38:10] <Catalin-> onenine90 I do not know friend, but this is my real name :)
[11:38:15] <NoiseEee> goddard: there's a done() callback goddard http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:38:35] <onenine90> Well then I think we should exchange email addresses because a girl who knows her jquery is out of this world
[11:38:35] <goddard> oh that might be help let me give it a shot
[11:39:07] <Catalin-> onenine90 Why not.
[11:39:26] <onenine90> svcghost@gmail.com :0
[11:39:27] <onenine90> :)
[11:39:54] <goddard> NoiseEee, this isn't my ajax function and I can't edit that source
[11:40:14] <goddard> NoiseEee, am i understanding this right?
[11:40:32] <NoiseEee> goddard: well the only way to know if an XHR/ajax request has finished is to use a callback
[11:40:40] <Catalin-> onenine90 You got mail.
[11:41:02] <goddard> NoiseEee, can i do it in some generic way?
[11:42:17] <onenine90> suweheeeeeeet
[12:13:05] <onenine90> Hello. I have this jquery line $('#options_dropdown').css('display','none');
[12:13:14] <onenine90> How would I apply that to ALL divs with ID options_dropdown ?
[12:13:34] <onenine90> right now it only applies to the first seen in html, not any of the following ones
[12:15:03] <onenine90> ah I see. using wildcards nvm thank u
[12:15:57] <NoiseEee> onenine90: uh, only one element in a document is allowed to use an ID.  they must be unique.
[12:16:15] <NoiseEee> perhaps you are interested in using css classes instead
[12:16:39] <onenine90> or the name property instead of id property
[12:16:42] <onenine90> i guess
[12:19:18] <gnarf> onenine90: class would be the best option
[12:19:27] <onenine90> ok thank you

[12:46:15] <Bogomip> Hi Guys - I have a function that updates all divs with the class "shorten" if they go over a certain length. The problem I am having is that the content to be shortened is loaded onto the page via a ".load()" jquery command, so the content isnt there before the jquery is initialised. Is there any way to "refresh" the jquery contnt on a page so newly loaded content can be dynamic in the same
[12:46:15] <Bogomip> way as if it were loaded at page load?
[12:46:26] <ravenzz> you can pause/resume iirc
[12:47:01] <Bogomip> hmmm
[12:47:06] <NoiseEee> Bogomip: just call the function again
[12:48:09] <Bogomip> its the document load function though
[12:48:23] <Bogomip> document ready rather
[12:49:59] <NoiseEee> well take the function out of there, make it its own function, and call it on both document.ready and your .load callback
[12:51:54] <Bogomip> still not working - im gonna pastebin this mother
[12:53:21] <gnarf> Bogomip: put the stuff that needs to run against new content in its own function
[12:53:26] <gnarf> call it once in doc ready
[12:53:33] <gnarf> and call it from the callback of the $.load
[12:53:38] <gnarf> re-use that chunk
[12:54:44] <Bogomip> like this? http://pastebin.com/wF4PgkTr
[12:55:03] <Bogomip> I tried that and it didnt work - the text appeared "see more", but when I click it nothing happens
[12:55:46] <gnarf> Bogomip: #main and #sidebar haven't finished loading yet....
[12:55:51] <gnarf> use the callback for $.load
[12:55:52] <Bogomip> which I usppose suggests its formatting and acting upon the text
[12:55:59] <Bogomip> ok
[12:56:00] <Bogomip> sec
[12:57:38] <Bogomip> that doesnt even add the "see more" text onto the long text
[12:57:44] <Bogomip> which implies its not looking at anything
[13:01:54] <ravenzz> Bogomip did you try $(section).load(page, short_text); ?
[13:02:26] <Drager> I'm making a slider but I need to do a nice slider effect, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/9/
[13:02:49] <Bogomip> i didnt ravenzz - but I will now
[13:04:21] <Bogomip> that does the "see more" again but alas, no effect when clicking the button
[13:05:52] <ravenzz> Bogomip a live demo would help, I am quite tired btw and I am about to go
[13:05:52] <Bogomip> although now
[13:05:57] <Bogomip> im not massively convinced about the library
[13:06:07] <Bogomip> ok, sec
[13:07:16] <Bogomip> www.sweeto.co.uk/YELLOW-PAGES
[13:07:22] <Bogomip> http://www.sweeto.co.uk/YELLOW-PAGES/
[13:07:48] <Bogomip> the third article down has a "see more" button
[13:07:52] <Bogomip> fourth
[13:09:55] <ravenzz> alright
[13:10:20] <basiclaser> is there a way to target the parent div in a manner similar to 'this'?
[13:10:53] <Gho5t> kwaht\
[13:10:55] <ravenzz> Bogomip you don't have any event listener
[13:11:21] <Bogomip> so i need to read about them
[13:11:27] <ravenzz> yep
[13:11:48] <ravenzz> but first of all you should read about how bad is to have inline js and css
[13:12:15] <ravenzz> second, read about progressive enhancement
[13:12:35] <Bogomip> will they help solve the current issue I am having? :)
[13:12:41] <ravenzz> and finally read about the jQuery's on()
[13:12:50] <ravenzz> YES
[13:13:02] <ravenzz> rofl
[13:14:08] <ravenzz> I am off to bed, bye and good luck
[13:14:19] <Bogomip> inline js and css isnt awful, just makes it a bit more difficult to maintain etc
[13:14:24] <Bogomip> i didnt think i had any inline css
[13:14:28] <Bogomip> but nm
[13:15:47] <jrockjiggz> Bogomip: inline can lead road blocks and challenges futhur development
[13:16:29] <Bogomip> im not looking for too much further development
[13:16:47] <Bogomip> i need a few bits to work and BANG. done.
[13:18:21] <Bogomip> I do appreciate the commends regarding how shit I am, and how much I should go and learn - but, for now, I have a more pressing matter :) A matter which tbh might make the idea of using inline js less needy as its the reason I use inline js, so, part 3 - on()
[13:19:00] <kanzie> Im trying to get an old code base working here and Im stumped at a problem. Im using jquery 1.7.1 and crossDomain 1 in .ajax(). Running towards one server works fine but when I switch to a different server I get cancelled on all requests
[13:19:15] <kanzie> they cancel out immediately so it seems to be local cancel
[13:19:28] <kanzie> the servers are serving the same code, what could I be missing here?
[13:20:36] <goddard> i am loading portions of my site with ajax but $(document).ready doesn't ever get executed when the js file is placed in the head
[13:20:38] <goddard> any ideas?
[13:20:40] <goddard> thanks
[13:23:36] <NoiseEee> goddard: document.ready is much different than when an ajax request has finished; it only loads when the document has loaded.
[13:23:54] <goddard> NoiseEee, hey man still working on this issue
[13:23:57] <NoiseEee> goddard: if you want to fire something after the ajax request has finished, use a callback
[13:24:19] <goddard> NoiseEee, i am unfamiliar with a callback when i don't make the request with my own code
[13:24:50] <NoiseEee> goddard: what do you mean you don't make it with your own code
[13:25:06] <goddard> this is apart of a CMS
[13:25:21] <goddard> I am not making the ajax request in my code
[13:25:26] <goddard> i am just making a module for it
[13:25:56] <NoiseEee> well i'm not sure what to tell you
[13:26:24] <NoiseEee> what problem are you trying to solve?
[13:26:34] <basiclaser> hey guys could i ask you a theoretical question?  If i have five buttons inside 5 corresponding div boxes, and I want to write the same jQuery behaviour for all of them can i somehow write the code once to affect them all? I'm sure this sort of scenario has a name
[13:26:45] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: event delegation
[13:26:46] <goddard> NoiseEee, just set some things on my form fields and functions
[13:26:49] <foo> I am using Easy Nivo Slider and it shows the loading icon for 1-2 seconds even if images are all in cache. I am trying to speed this up/optimize site, but it seems like it shows the loading icon no matter what. Any tips on why this happens? (can link to the site if it helps)
[13:26:50] <basiclaser> thanks
[13:27:17] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: $(commonParent).on('click','button',function(e) { alert('a button has been pressed!'); });
[13:27:33] <NoiseEee> goddard: what does ajax have to do with anything
[13:27:44] <goddard> the page is loaded with ajax
[13:28:15] <NoiseEee> goddard: so maybe what you can do is create a setInterval function that checks for the presence of the loaded elements, and when it finds them, it fires off the function you like
[13:28:35] <basiclaser> cheers noiseEee
[13:29:27] <superdo> hey
[13:29:35] <superdo> whats the wrong with this method call? http://hastebin.com/daqavuleye.coffee
[13:29:52] <mo_roodi> noiseee that seems like a pretty inefficient way to do it, surely you could do the ajax in a deferred and when the deferred gets resolved do something with the result at that point?
[13:29:57] <superdo> i get "d is not defined"
[13:31:00] <superdo> ok var d solved :P
[13:33:19] <superdo> no, not good.
[13:36:45] <mo_roodi> superdo: can you create a fiddle for it?
[13:46:22] <superdo> mo_roodi, i solved
[13:46:44] <superdo> i used an anon.function
[13:47:01] <superdo> im not pro with object literals
[13:47:24] <Gho5t> i am
[13:49:09] <superdo> Gho5t, so then how to call a method with parameter in ol: http://hastebin.com/daqavuleye.coffee
[13:50:47] <Gho5t> superdo: I'm not sure what the question is
[13:51:51] <superdo> i want to call a method "process" from "init" passing a parameter
[13:52:04] <foo> I am having some issue with this silder on the front page: http://166.78.58.123/ - notice how the loading gif always shows up, even when images are cached. Is there a way to speed this up? I feel like it shouldn't always take so long to load
[13:52:10] <superdo> i get "d is not defined" error
[13:52:19] <Novalgina2Fast> Hi, I'm trying to change the header when the page scroll down, how i can do that? i've written this function but it doesn't work, any help? http://pastebin.com/0fQNtDaQ
[13:52:28] <superdo> its sure simple i just dont get it
[13:53:03] <Gho5t> superdo: what is getmenuitems
[13:53:14] <superdo> sorry, the obj literal name
[13:53:28] <rindolf> Novalgina2Fast: let me see.
[13:53:28] <superdo> var getmenuitem  = { }
[13:53:42] <Novalgina2Fast> thanks
[13:54:28] <rindolf> Novalgina2Fast: you have bad indentation and you should put the if clauses inside { ... }
[13:54:36] <kanzie> I have a problem when I try to load data using ajax() I get cancelled but if I go to the URL in the browser it loads fine. I have crossDomain=1 in my ajaxSetup()
[13:54:50] <kanzie> what could I be missing
[13:55:47] <Gho5t> superdo, try: this.process(d)
[13:56:05] <superdo> ah
[13:56:18] <superdo> ok
[13:57:41] <superdo> Gho5t, "this.process is not a function" error
[13:58:11] <Gho5t> ok
[13:58:23] <Gho5t> you need a reference to the object
[13:58:32] <Gho5t> try adding _that: this,
[13:58:36] <Gho5t> above the init function
[13:58:50] <Gho5t> then do _that.process instead of this.process
[14:04:12] <superdo> "_that is not defined"
[14:04:40] <mo_roodi> superdo: take a look at this http://pastebin.com/p6sZ4buC
[14:04:42] <Gho5t> pastebin the whole code pls
[14:05:49] <superdo> repasted my code: http://hastebin.com/fekexubawa.coffee
[14:07:05] <superdo> damn, i saw it in Jeffrey Way's video but not I dont have it here
[14:07:50] <superdo> mo_roodi, checking
[14:08:30] <mo_roodi> superdo: it's one I've just knocked up so it might need a little tweaking, but I think the code's sensible
[14:09:05] <superdo> okey trying to implement..
[14:10:26] <basiclaser> Hey guys, I can get jQuery working on tutorial sites and in JSfiddle just fine, but whenever i chuck into my html and js files, it does absolutely nothing in the browser, I have latest firefox and use exactly the same code as in JSfiddle. What , beyond the script src tag do i need to insert into my html to connect it? or could it be something else?
[14:10:26] <mo_roodi> I think the reason you can't reference the "process" function because it's a member of the json object... that's why using the anonymous function works, but attempting to call the process function doesn't work.
[14:10:50] <mo_roodi> basiclaser: can you pastebin your code?
[14:11:12] <basiclaser> sure ill fiddle it to you in just a minute
[14:11:29] <superdo> mo_roodi, could be it hmm
[14:11:36] <carpii> basiclaser: are you sure youre putting your code inside a $(document).ready( ?
[14:13:29] <basiclaser> yeh I'm just double checking it
[14:13:36] <skypce> hello guys
[14:13:41] <skypce> do you can helpme please
[14:13:57] <skypce> i want to move $('.block-search').prepend($('.leaf-search'));
[14:14:00] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: and your console says...
[14:14:39] <basiclaser> I don't use a console, can i use one in firefox to see whats going on?
[14:14:52] <basiclaser> ah got it :)
[14:14:55] <basiclaser> thats useful
[14:15:01] <basiclaser> thanks noisee
[14:15:52] <skypce> my site is skypce.chickenkiller.com/sitebilvavi
[14:16:04] <skypce> i want show search block inline with menu
[14:16:15] <skypce> please , thanks
[14:17:58] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: if you're using firefox, you should def. have 'firebug' in your toolbox
[14:18:15] <basiclaser> ok is it 3rd party?
[14:18:24] <NoiseEee> yes, getfirebug.com
[14:18:28] <basiclaser> ok
[14:18:42] <carpii> id recommend chrome much more for developing. It has firebug built in and a bit nicer to use
[14:18:58] <carpii> not strictly firebug, but its essentially the same thing
[14:19:04] <basiclaser> i have my own emotional problems with chrome :D
[14:19:09] <carpii> :(
[14:19:14] <carpii> but google loves you :(
[14:19:41] <mo_roodi> try chromium (chrome with the "google")
[14:19:57] <superdo> thx, night
[14:20:00] <basiclaser> google just creeps me out :P
[14:20:55] <Wanfu> Wondering if there is a way to make a <div> that has contenteditable=true, to autoresize its width, according to what the contents are (when typed)
[14:22:49] <Guest32532> Wanfu: Sure
[14:23:12] <Guest32532> Wanfu: Just watch for scrollHeight to become larger than height and resize
[14:24:19] <Wanfu> Guest32532, yes, but how do I determine what size to make it? I am trying to get dimensions
[14:24:26] <Stephen> Sorry abouthat
[14:24:39] <Stephen> Wanfu: height = scrollHeight
[14:25:45] <JFranks> basiclaser: If Google creeps you out then you must be an Opera guy? Or IE? .. I mean Mozilla's biggest financial backer is Google.. So.. ?
[14:25:56] <basiclaser> NoiseEee: here's my work so far: http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/dre9G/
[14:25:57] <Wanfu> Stephen, I have set white-space: nowrap so it does not wrap text
[14:26:19] <basiclaser> the fadein doesn't happen, nor does the background color change
[14:26:49] <Stephen> $("divId[contenteditable=true]").on("scroll", function() { $(this).height(this.scrollHeight); });
[14:26:55] <Stephen> I believe that's what you are looking for
[14:27:07] <basiclaser> JFranks: It just bugged me how chrome tried to stealth install itself on my dads computer even though he already had it:P
[14:27:13] <zeroXten> anyone able to help me with this problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14976643/rails-3-jquery-markdown-editor-has-no-method
[14:27:15] <Stephen> Wanfu: You need width too? It should work just the same
[14:27:19] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: you have the same ID on multiple forms
[14:27:26] <Wanfu> Stephen, no, I dont to change the height, but the width
[14:27:30] <basiclaser> it should still work though right?
[14:27:36] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: no, thats illegal markup
[14:27:39] <basiclaser> i was going to set up ids after
[14:27:40] <Stephen> $("divId[contenteditable=true]").on("scroll", function() { $(this).height(this.scrollHeight); $(this).width(this.scrollWidth); });
[14:27:41] <basiclaser> ohhh
[14:27:47] <jeffsmykil> Do query plugin options persist if the option isn't updated?
[14:27:49] <Stephen> Wanfu: Ah
[14:27:53] <NoiseEee> basiclaser: change $('#bg-form') to just $('form')
[14:28:01] <Stephen> Wanfu: $("divId[contenteditable=true]").on("scroll", function() { $(this).width(this.scrollWidth); });
[14:29:10] <JFranks> basiclaser: Ahhh yeah. Most people who are afraid of Google do base it on some misunderstanding. I've been digging for something 'legitimately' wrong with them for years.. Closest I've come is that they are harmful to businesses that have less powerful 'paid' solutions that they cannot sell because Google has better options for free.
[14:29:35] <Stephen> Wanfu: The technique is to watch for the div to scroll. I think when one makes an element contenteditable that it autoscrolls to the cursor, but I may be wrong there
[14:29:51] <basiclaser> NoiseEee: thanks! what was i thinking...
[14:31:28] <Wanfu> Stephen, so .scrollWidth is not a jquery property?
[14:32:27] <ameoba> Working with a 3rd party library that expects to be handed a bare element.  $("#div_i") gives me an array with one element.  Is there a better way to do this than $("#div_id")[0]?
[14:33:00] <ameoba> I guess "more idiomatic" is what I'm shooting for
[14:33:22] <Stephen> Wanfu: No, scrollWidth is a native property
[14:33:28] <Wanfu> Stephen, I see now, I just had to use $(this)[0].scrollWidth
[14:33:57] <Stephen> Ah, very good.
[14:34:33] <Wanfu> Stephen, thanks a bunch, now I am making some progress finally :)
[14:34:49] <ibc> Hi all, I would appreciate if somebody can answer to my question in the forum: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/why-does-somediv-somediv-return-false
[14:34:49] <ibc> Basically I ask:   Why does $("#somediv") === $("#somediv") return false?
[14:34:49] <ibc> I assume that the selector returns a different Object each time it is invoked regarless it points to the same DOM element, am I right?
[14:35:17] <Stephen> ibc: Yes
[14:35:31] <Stephen> ibc: That's why object caching is so important
[14:35:51] <ibc> ok, nice to know. Thanks a lot.
[14:37:25] <basiclaser> aww geez noiseEee left :3
[14:39:03] <Drager> I'm making a slider but I need to do a nice slider effect, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/9/
[14:42:20] <Stephen> Drager: Yeah, this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxP291Yyns
[14:43:08] <Drager> Stephen: o,0
[14:43:21] <Stephen> I loved that show
[14:44:19] <Drager> ;>
[14:44:21] <Drager> ;<*
[14:50:51] <basiclaser> if i want to affect the closest div can i write it in something like this format? $("closest.div").effect();
[15:02:09] <slick-> hey
[15:06:26] <JFranks> yesterday I had a fellow saying Google Earth is a better datasource for city/county names.. I'm not logging the channel so I lost the discussion and I'm trying to figure out what he was tapping into?
[15:06:40] <JFranks> (better than geonames.org)
[15:07:28] <ajpiano> JFranks: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[15:07:43] <kristofers> I'm adding the result of a multiplcation using .html and in the source i see the input being updated
[15:07:52] <kristofers> but the input is still blank
[15:08:05] <kristofers> visually
[15:08:33] <JFranks> ajpiano: Daymn.. Found it! https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete
[15:08:36] <awc737> starting a channel, should it be #zurb or #foundation or #foundationzurb
[15:10:46] <basiclaser> what is curb? :)
[15:10:53] <basiclaser> curb rather
[15:10:59] <basiclaser> zurb****
[15:11:01] <JFranks> Funny.. and it was 'awc737' who pointed that link out.. ;P
[15:11:05] <JFranks> Small channel..
[15:11:22] <jrockjiggz> ?on
[15:11:27] <awc737> huh? curb?

[15:12:15] <[1]iDope> Can I use jQuery .submit() function to submit form data to 2 urls (one using ajax and other using the normal submit button functionality?
[15:12:19] <zmo> hi, I was wondering if anybody around was familiar with dynatree or fancytree jquery module? I'd like to know how I can insert <div> inside tree <li> elements in fancytree
[15:14:01] <ajpiano> awc737: http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming
[15:14:15] <Novalgina2Fast> hi, someone knows what i'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/WyFnRJHe it's a code to change the header when scroll down tha page
[15:14:25] <awc737> ajpiano: is #foundation acceptable
[15:14:40] <ajpiano> ask in #freenode
[15:15:05] <coldhead> or ##freenode
[15:15:21] <zmo> registred "about" channels shall be ##
[15:15:34] <zmo> (usually officials channel for a technology)
[15:15:50] <zmo> otherwise it's #, that's what I've understood iirc
[15:16:55] <zmo> or that's the contrary :)
[15:17:01] <coldhead> alls i know is there is #php and ##php and i'm banned from both
[15:17:13] <awc737> LOL
[15:17:21] <awc737> I get banned from #php all the time
[15:17:32] <awc737> dbags
[15:18:19] <awc737> JFranks: nvm going with #zurb
[15:19:00] <JFranks> I dunno what IRC clients you guys use.. but all mine resolve '##php' and '#php' to the same channel. :)
[15:19:08] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano defaults to persist across method calls with plugins?
[15:19:18] <jeffsmykil> mine keep going back to the original settings
[15:19:19] <ajpiano> that's not even a question jeffsmykil
[15:19:26] <JFranks> In fact all mine assume # if you omit it.. :)
[15:19:27] <ajpiano> i donno man
[15:19:36] <ajpiano> why do you think i just magically know what code you have writen
[15:19:46] <jeffsmykil> good point
[15:19:58] <JFranks> Wait.. ajpiano doesn't magically know?!
[15:20:08] * JFranks is a bit freaked out.
[15:20:59] <ajpiano> correct
[15:22:07] <coldhead> these are truly the last days
[15:29:27] <endzyme> having a problem grabbing json from a page: see GIST> https://gist.github.com/endzyme/e5e5b96ac0f4a408ef80
[15:29:37] <Novalgina2Fast_> i'm doing again the questions just because i quit before and i don't know if someone answer me. I need to change the header everytime the user scroll down the page, i've written this code, but it doesn't work and i don't know why: http://pastebin.com/WyFnRJHe  The website: http://www.inspirates.net/  any help will be really appreciated
[15:29:46] <endzyme> Anyone have a moment to peek
[15:30:06] <endzyme> Basically the error is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :"
[15:34:39] <slick-> if i have code like this: http://jsfiddle.net/U38h4/
[15:34:53] <slick-> how do i target the form_field_error_message inside
[15:35:09] <slick-> I have multiple form_field_error_messages on the page, but i wanna target the one inside ugc_file
[15:36:08] <jrockjiggz> $('.ugc .form_field_error_message)
[15:36:12] <jrockjiggz> $('.ugc .form_field_error_message')
[15:36:16] <Wolfed> Hey guys, I was wondering, is it possible to run a script with every ajax call? Like a single function that will be applied to all my later-realized ajax calls?
[15:36:46] <jrockjiggz> $.ajaxComplete() (may be deprecate)
[15:37:46] <Wolfed> That might do part of the trick. I'll check it out
[15:37:48] <Wolfed> Thanks
[15:38:33] <jrockjiggz> Wolfed: should be $(document).ajaxComplete( function(){}); //bind to document
[15:38:59] <slick-> $('.ugc_file .form_field_error_message').html('haha'); should work too riter
[15:39:12] <jrockjiggz> yea
[15:39:59] <slick-> doesn't work
[15:40:00] <slick-> hmmm
[15:40:49] <jrockjiggz> slick-: $('.ugc .form_field_error_message')
[15:41:10] <Wolfed> Isnt deprectaed and works wonderfully. Thanks a lot.
[15:41:23] <jrockjiggz> in your previous msg: $('.ugc_file .form_field_error_message') meaning .form inside of .ugc_file.   .ugc_file is an input eleemnt, it cannot be parent
[15:42:19] <jrockjiggz> Wolfed: yes I use it, it has a draw back in that it cannot wait for any ajax success callback to complete. it just fires on its own with no relation..  down the road I plan on moving onto delegations.. but thats another day
[15:43:13] <jrockjiggz> Wolfed: I had a scenario where I needed what I was doing in ajaxComplete() to fire AFTER the success callback (for dom elements to be in place).. but couldn't
[15:44:08] <Wolfed> Well I am not looking into something uber complicated. I just need to check for the data received and switch the code to work out redirects. Seemd easier than adding the redirect on every page I had :P
[16:04:32] <_jmg> hi, i'm new to jquery and i'm just trying to do get a simple list of list items using var list = $('ul'); .. when i do a console.log(list); i get .. Object {list: b.fn.b.init[1]} .. and it's not until i type in list in the console i get the html .. i've watched tutorials and all seem to get the html straight from console.log .. can anyone explain what i'm doing wrong
[16:05:11] <iLoveU> what is this jquery tech called: zdnet.com : animated slider wrapper: Telstra's ...
[16:06:05] <iLoveU> i noticed this is not a new jquery, however i try to learn now
[16:06:51] <iLoveU> zdnet.com : section above : featured stories.
[16:08:30] <iLoveU> i checked the html source code: .carousel .sliderWrapper
[16:08:50] <iLoveU> however not sure where is the js bit to control the auto play
[16:10:48] <tw2113> coldhead, i just started my journey to being a JavaScript ninja
[16:12:04] <discorpia> you might mean jquery ninja
[16:12:20] <dwarder> i am trying to check if at least one checkbox is selected, where have i mistaken http://jsfiddle.net/fy3mT/
[16:12:35] <tw2113> nope
[16:12:41] <tw2113> the book said "JavaScript"
[16:13:05] <tw2113> discorpia, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193398869X/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
[16:13:23] <coldhead> way to be, tw2113
[16:13:29] <coldhead> maybe it will stop you RTing so damn much
[16:13:33] <raj> tw2113, is this considered one of the top books?
[16:13:45] <tw2113> no idea raj
[16:13:50] <raj> what's rt'ing coldhead?
[16:13:57] <dwarder> anyone?
[16:13:59] <tw2113> i do know that it's co-authored by the person who authored jQuery
[16:14:07] <tw2113> retweeting, raj, twitter stuff
[16:14:11] <raj> that's pretty legit
[16:14:17] <raj> gotcha
[16:14:29] <raj> coldhead, you're following tw2113 on twitter?
[16:14:31] <coldhead> it's bound to be a decent read
[16:14:42] <coldhead> i do, raj
[16:14:49] <coldhead> every day
[16:14:52] <tdignan> I'm trying to use draggable. My element lives inside a <ul> that has overflow:auto set for when the list items exceed the height of the container
[16:15:01] <tdignan> I set containment to "window"
[16:15:05] <tdignan> becaue I want to drag it anywhere
[16:15:26] <tdignan> but when I drag, it just stretches the overflow using a scrollbar instead of leaving the container and going to the outer levels of nesting
[16:15:45] <tdignan> is this a common mistake or should I try to make a fiddle
[16:18:54] <dwarder> another iteration http://jsfiddle.net/8Yqa3/ anyone please take a look?
[16:19:44] <carpii> a look for what? whats not working
[16:20:12] <dwarder> carpii: i'm trying to test if at least one checkbox is checked
[16:20:20] <tdignan> nm, I found my answer
[16:20:24] <tdignan> thanks anyway
[16:20:27] <tdignan> appendTo: ?
[16:20:28] <tdignan> :)
[16:21:01] <iLoveU> ok found the name = jquery carousel
[16:21:10] <iLoveU> thanks anyway
[16:27:36] <carpii> dwarder: im not sure if jsfiddler is even working at the moment. I cant even get it to show an unconditional alert
[16:27:50] <carpii> but have you tried something like
[16:27:51] <carpii> var isChecked = $("input:checkbox[name=pro]:checked").length > 0;
[16:28:27] <carpii> ah you do need the [] after the name, i wasnt sure
[16:28:31] <carpii> var isChecked = $("input:checkbox[name=pro[]]:checked").length > 0;
[16:29:10] <carpii> oh and try quoting the name in single quotes
[16:29:11] <say2joe> you don't need "> 0"
[16:29:30] <carpii> yeah good call
[16:29:33] <say2joe> just "$("input:checkbox[name=pro[]]:checked").length;" will do it.
[16:29:52] <dwarder> carpii: i got alert working here (not in fucntion) http://jsfiddle.net/QgYhF/
[16:30:05] <dwarder> carpii: something wrong with the function call
[16:30:07] <dwarder> ?
[16:30:26] <carpii> hm yes that works here too now. maybe my chrome tab was screwed up i dont know
[16:30:43] <carpii> i just had a single alert("FOO"); and it wasnt triggering
[16:32:07] <carpii> not sure yet dwarder, i cant really see anything wrong with it
[16:32:26] <carpii> youve tested the same code locally ?
[16:34:37] <dwarder> carpii: yes, something is wrong with jsfiddle, will try localy now
[16:35:16] <carpii> yeah its pretty screwy i think
[16:35:25] <carpii> and very slow :(
[16:44:27] <veQue> $(".curFocus").val($(".curFocus").val().length -1);  if the value equals 1234 shouldnt the new value = 123?
[16:44:51] <veQue> ohhh noooo
[16:44:56] <veQue> i caught my mistake
[16:47:22] <say2joe> :)
[16:51:10] <esas> How does jQuery Mobile achieve url changes without reloading the page?
[16:51:23] <Brixius> question, I'm trying to replace a line of javascript code with the jquery equivlent, I have the following "var listfrom = document.getElementById('UsersOrgs');" and thought I could replace it with something like "var listfrom = $('#UsersOrgs');" but it's not working, I'm guessing it's something simple, any clues?
[16:51:58] <carpii> your original was a raw element, but the jquery version returns a jquery object encapsulating the element
[16:52:08] <esas> the listfrom is now a jquery object
[16:52:24] <carpii> you can use $("#UserOrgs")[0] to remain compatible with your old code
[16:52:31] <carpii> but itd be better to convert the rest to jquery too
[16:53:01] <Brixius> ok, thanks, I'll so some research and see about converting all of it.
[16:58:44] <dblosevn> never use $('selector')[0] use $('selector').get(0) instead to avoid a fatal when there isnt a match
[17:00:00] <dblosevn> or .eq(0) if you want to save a byte lol
[17:00:11] <coldhead> >: |
[17:00:24] <dblosevn> lol
[17:04:30] <dblosevn> i went ahead and wrote that stausbar the other night couldnt find anything close enough to what i wanted lol
[17:04:42] <dblosevn> gonna turn it into a jquery plugin eventually lol
[17:04:50] <coldhead> that's awesome lol
[17:04:55] <coldhead> you should put it on github
[17:05:16] <raj> dblosevn, what's the statusbar do?
[17:06:53] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/111 code, markup http://dblosevn.chosd.com/112
[17:08:12] <Novalgina2Fast_> hi, someone can help me with a (probably stupid ) problem with a jquery function. I need to change the header of the page when i scroll down the page, i've written this function but it doesn't work http://pastebin.com/WyFnRJHe website http://www.inspirates.net/
[17:10:25] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/113 little bit of usuage
[17:10:58] <dblosevn> its cool as hell i bound ajaxStart and ajaxStop to start and stop the blinky lights
[17:15:12] <dblosevn> here it is in action: http://screencast.com/t/EsxQORrT8e
[17:15:31] <hateIE10> filthy little twitter bird!
[17:15:59] <hateIE10> 31 seconds to load the tweet button... jeez was wondering why my site was taking a long time to load
[17:16:58] <dblosevn> needs a little styling help but i think its pretty cool :-)
[17:20:35] <dblosevn> ie 10 just scared the hell out of me, im almost done with this project and i just now opened it in ie10 and nothing worked lol
[17:20:48] <veQue> i should only have one class called .currentClass  if i want to set a variable to it how would i do it? i'm not sure var $this = $(".currentClass"); is working
[17:21:20] <dblosevn> veQue: that works but it grabs all elements with that class at that time
[17:21:24] <veQue> and can i use the DOM in firebug to see all my objects? i've stayed away from the DOM for the most part
[17:21:45] <dblosevn> if you add another element with that class and dont reinitalize it $this wont have that in the array
[17:21:56] <veQue> dblosevn: hmm i was loking up class arrays
[17:22:25] <dblosevn> your always better off reinitalizing your vars when you need them
[17:22:38] <veQue> can i use var $this = $(".currentClass:eq(1)");
[17:22:39] <dblosevn> id never do what you did though with $this
[17:22:40] <veQue> ?
[17:23:06] <veQue> you mean you'd use a different name?
[17:23:16] <dblosevn> id do something like $this = $(this); to be able to use `this` inside a callback in the scope of this
[17:23:29] <veQue> yeah i probably wouldnt use this i'm just in a bind it could be any name rally at this point
[17:23:55] <veQue> can i use var $abc = $(".currentClass:eq(1)");
[17:24:07] <dblosevn> ya
[17:24:29] <veQue> hmm k i'm still missing something
[17:24:36] <dblosevn> $fname = $('input[name="fname"]'); $fname.val('John');
[17:24:37] <veQue> neighbors so loud
[17:25:32] <veQue> may need to sound proof -_-
[17:26:02] <dblosevn> gotta rock lol
[17:26:48] <dblosevn> just one question how do you build anything in jquery without touching the dom lol
[17:28:03] <Brixius> in the following line "$('#AllOrgs > option:selected').each(function () { alert(this.text); });" am I correct in thinking that "this" should be set for each iteration of the each function to the current option.
[17:28:25] <veQue> dblosevn: *shrugs*
[17:28:25] <b-ot> veQue: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:28:25] <dblosevn> Brixius: yep
[17:28:40] <veQue> i know of it, i know just enough about it to stay afloat
[17:29:04] <dblosevn> seeing as how jquery just makes querying the dom easier lol
[17:29:16] <veQue> but i'm getting bags under my eyes i may need to learn more
[17:29:36] <veQue> i guess you gotta start somewhere
[17:30:02] <dblosevn> yep yeop
[17:30:52] <dblosevn> Brixius: also keep in mind $('selector').each(function(key, obj) {
[17:31:23] <dblosevn> Brixius: inside the callback you can use either `this` or `obj` to access the current element
[17:31:56] <lil-murph> Can you not catch an exception raise from within a $.Callbacks() when you fire it?
[17:34:47] <dblosevn> lil-murph: i dont think it would be possible for me to understand you any less lol how bout a demo
[17:35:14] <lil-murph> good point :)
[17:38:21] <veQue> dblosevn:  mind giving me a crash course in DOM ? i mean if i have several objects or one with a class name i should be able to find them in the DOM right?
[17:38:43] <dblosevn> veQue: you can find anything in the dom lol
[17:39:23] <dblosevn> use classes for multiple objects that are like on a page, use ids for objects that will only be on the page once ever
[17:39:46] <dblosevn> ?g js DOM for dummys
[17:39:46] <b-ot> dblosevn: Taking the Document Object Model (DOM) Approach ... - For Dummies â†’ http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/taking-the-document-object-model-dom-approach-to-x.html
[17:40:07] <say2joe> I just posted this plugin last week: http://plugins.jquery.com/cache/ its for caching the dom â€” to prevent overuse of (same) selector lookups.
[17:40:10] <dblosevn> lmao there actually was a result i was totally kidding
[17:40:18] <lil-murph> EH. Seems my issue isn't as direct as I though. Might be something with qunit. Meh. I'll keep workign on it.
[17:40:21] <veQue> dblosevn:  yeh the i'm using .addClass and i need  the class to bounce around a bit
[17:40:43] <dblosevn> veQue: so put some air in it so it bounces lol
[17:40:46] <say2joe> don't forget toggleClass â€” quite useful if adding and removing.
[17:40:57] <dblosevn> ya toggle class is your friend
[17:41:16] <say2joe> indeed :)
[17:41:43] <veQue> hmm
[17:41:49] <veQue> i'll make a note
[17:42:04] <veQue> but for now i'm looking in the DOM and seeing WAY too much info
[17:42:56] <dblosevn> that link actually isnt a bad doc for learning dom
[17:43:19] <veQue> k i'll actually open it then =)
[17:45:11] <say2joe> if anyone has any feedback, it'd be appreciated: https://github.com/say2joe/jquery.cache â€¦ I'm still wondering if anyone will use it. It would be nice if there was similar functionality built-in to jQuery Core though.
[17:46:34] <hateIE10> hey whats the crack with jplayer and Internet exploere 10
[17:47:29] <Adys> does anyone know of a fast way to check for the presence of an element k in a <datalist>? (where each option is <option value=k>)
[17:48:34] <dblosevn> $('datalist option[value="'+k+'"]')
[17:48:43] <sheilablackrose> hi guys, if source.childNodes[5].value; is my checkbox value, how can i set this property to checked
[17:49:10] <dblosevn> $(source.childNodes[5]).prop('checked', true);
[17:49:11] <damienbrz> sheilablackrose: source.childNodes[5].checked
[17:50:44] <sheilablackrose> tq
[17:53:04] <say2joe> source.childNodes[5].checked = true;
[17:53:53] <say2joe> or, to toggle the state from checked to unchecked: source.childNodes[5].checked ^= 1;
[17:54:02] <tw2113> wouldn't it be double ='s?
[17:54:25] <say2joe> are you checking if its checked or setting it to checked?
[17:55:13] <say2joe> assignment (setting to checked) " = true;" â€¦ checking if it is checked or not " == true; "
[17:55:17] <danheberden> creating jq elements using childNodes[] is dangerous
[17:55:23] <danheberden> if you are caching them
[17:55:39] <danheberden> i'd use .children
[17:56:14] <danheberden> well, i suppose the jq collection would still point to the same dom element
[18:01:43] <CodeFriar> I have an odd api and auth situation where I have to make a post request to get an image -- what's sent back to me is the binary of the image in either jpg or png format. I'm gotten jquery's ajax working -- i get the binary data back... any idea how to drop it into an image tag or a canvas element ?
[18:04:31] <say2joe> you can try: http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/
[18:10:16] <djj_> Can someone correct me is this the correct way to add the classes "Half Full Semi-foo" to my "rota td" elements --->  $('.rota td').addClass("Half Full Semi-Foo");
[18:11:31] <mlr> djj_ looks fine to me
[18:11:38] <mlr> is it not working?
[18:11:50] <djj_> mlr: Yeah its not working.
[18:12:35] <mlr> are you sure your $('.rota td') selector is returning the elem properly?
[18:12:38] <carpii> what does $(".rota td").length  return if you type it into console?
[18:14:09] <djj_> I mean I knwo $(.'.rota td') works because I am using a .live event on it
[18:14:12] <djj_> *know
[18:14:40] <carpii> well its not working, so..
[18:14:45] <carpii> whats it say in console ? :p
[18:16:11] <mlr> console wouldn't show it selecting properly if its a DOM elem being inserted (probably why he's using live).  could do a console.log($('.rota td')) before the addClass line
[18:16:32] <mlr> console.log($('.rota td').length);
[18:20:24] <djj_> mlr: it isn't returning nothing but like I say I have used $('.rota td') before with my jquery dialog - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5001443
[18:25:05] <xsamurai> can somebody check if this http://jsfiddle.net/Y9mSw/ is the correct way to have an either or selection setup ?
[18:25:08] <gaf> hello, i have some mootools here that i wanted to convert to jquery. anyone able to help? http://jsfiddle.net/KhCd6/
[18:34:32] <Richhh> im getting a problem i suspect is due to rebinding the .click() of a div
[18:34:49] <Richhh> the div seems to execute the function n times where n is the number of times it got rebound
[18:35:34] <Richhh> im gonna try unbinding it before rebinding now
[18:37:21] <Richhh> yes fixed
[18:40:36] <tdignan> Hey, I want to use the connectToSortable attribute of jQuery UI's draggable to connect an element to every container but the one that currently contains it
[18:40:44] <tdignan> it seems just connecting to all causes a bad flicker to occur
[18:40:46] <tdignan> how can I do that?
[18:40:52] <xsamurai> can somebody check if this http://jsfiddle.net/Y9mSw/ is the correct way to have an either or selection setup ?
[18:40:54] <tdignan> I have an arbitrary number of droppables.
[18:43:41] <hateIE10> here i have an example of jplayer "shoutcast streaming": http://souliqradio.net/newsite/demo-08-pf.htm
[18:44:05] <hateIE10> i cant get no love from Internet exreminter
[18:45:09] <Foxhoundz> hateIE10: Works fine on IE9
[18:45:15] <hateIE10> HRMMM
[18:45:27] <Foxhoundz> and therefore it should work on IE10
[18:46:03] <Foxhoundz> Make sure you set IE to render in IE9+ in the dev tools
[18:46:06] <Foxhoundz> that could be it
[18:54:04] <raj> coldhead, still here?
[18:56:22] <danheberden> it's getting him to leave that's the hard part
[19:01:11] <Adys> CodeFriar: you can query it in a way that the browser will cache it
[19:01:25] <CodeFriar> Adys: say more ?
[19:01:36] <Adys> CodeFriar: if you do that, you can then do img src="..." and it wont redownload
[19:02:08] <Adys> CodeFriar: Try creating an img element with that uri as display none somewhere
[19:02:20] <Adys> and then display it when you need it
[19:02:24] <CodeFriar> Adys: problem is I don't get a url ... I just get the binary data
[19:02:31] <Adys> where from?
[19:02:36] <CodeFriar> evernote
[19:02:52] <CodeFriar> pulling thumbnails from private notes via the api ... I have to make a post request
[19:02:58] <CodeFriar> and the return data is a raw binary stream
[19:03:07] <CodeFriar> trying to figure out how to get that into an image.
[19:03:11] <Adys> ah
[19:03:20] <CodeFriar> it's not bin64 incoded
[19:03:34] <CodeFriar> encoded, and when I try to encode it, nothing seems to work
[19:04:03] <CodeFriar> also tried loading the raw binary into a canvas element -- no dice
[19:04:05] <Adys> you're not encoding it properly then, base64 would be the only way for an actual img tag
[19:04:25] <CodeFriar> Adys: tried bota
[19:05:58] <CodeFriar> Adys: also tried tihs: https://gist.github.com/jonleighton/958841/raw/f200e30dfe95212c0165ccf1ae000ca51e9de803/gistfile1.js
[19:06:49] <nesoi> in jquery mobile, if I have 2 pages in the same dom with footers that have the same button in them (meaning I have 2 things with the same ID in different data-role='page' divs in the dom), is that a problem for event handlers like $("#id").on("click", etc?
[19:07:03] <Adys> CodeFriar: are you embedding it properly in the uri?
[19:07:03] <nesoi> cuz the one I
[19:07:10] <nesoi> 'm looking at doesn't seem to be getting fired
[19:07:12] <Adys> data:base64,image/jpg;...
[19:07:28] <CodeFriar> Adys: yeah, totally setting it with data:base64, image/png
[19:07:37] <rmurphey> nesoi: two elements with the same id is not a good idea
[19:07:40] <Adys> er sorry
[19:08:09] <Adys> data:image/jpeg;base64,...
[19:08:11] <rmurphey> if you need to bind event handlers to multiple elements, you wnat to use a class
[19:08:12] <nesoi> rmurphey : I thought so... so how do I put the same button on multiple page footers?
[19:08:28] <CodeFriar> Adys:  I think  I may not be loading my array buffer right ...
[19:09:05] <rmurphey> nesoi: $(".myClass").on('click', ...)
[19:09:18] <rmurphey> and make sure each element shares a common class
[19:09:52] <hateIE10> Foxhoundz sorry to be a bother but is it working now ?
[19:10:06] <hateIE10> in IE9 that is..
[19:10:11] <nesoi> rmurphey : so just replace id= with class= and replace # with . ?
[19:11:34] <Foxhoundz> hateIE10: yes.
[19:12:24] <nesoi> hm... still not working
[19:14:10] <hateIE10> Foxhoundz and does this one play too? www.unitystreams.com/zen-player/play2.html
[19:21:55] <thinkerweb> You know, jquery mobile's way of using data-rel back isn't always great, cause sometimes things load slow, and use will click cancel and back button due to im-patients and end too far back
[19:22:26] <theCatIsPurr> when i invoke $.getScript the script is not loaded into the head. is it loaded into memory and invoked with eval?
[19:23:46] <theCatIsPurring> !answerbot
[19:26:09] <dcherman> theCatIsPurring: depends on if its crossdomain or not.  see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/script.js
[19:26:28] <theCatIsPurring> thanks will look
[19:27:44] * tw2113 danheberden *horses whinny*
[19:28:35] <danheberden> tw2113: was it my imagination, or did i see you over in a mozilla irc chan?
[19:28:38] <theCatIsPurring> evel seems heavy handed.
[19:28:45] <theCatIsPurring> eval rather seems heavy handed.
[19:28:57] <djj_> Any idea why my .addClass() is not doing what is supposed to do. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5001756 I get the following output. http://i.imgur.com/3S7r7mN.png What supposed to happen is that by default all cells are white and depending on which cell is selected determines what color the cell is
[19:28:59] <tw2113> i'm currently in devmo and devtools on irc.mozilla
[19:29:11] <danheberden> tw2113: so hot
[19:29:34] <djj_> evidently it is partially working but I cannot seem to understand that when I load the page it does this. Do i need to use .change?
[19:29:36] <tw2113> documentation of the web and firefox's inspector tools <3
[19:30:12] <tw2113> the part with the horse whinny is a reference to Young Frankenstein
[19:30:50] <djj_> Also tried to do $("#hospital_booking_shift_type").change(function(){   $(this).closest('td').removeClass('Half Full Semi-Foo').addClass($(this).val()) }) and this did not work
[19:31:13] <tw2114> jquery changed the world
[19:31:28] <tw2114> yes it is so simple
[19:31:47] <tw2113> jQuery helped bring a resurgence in js popularity, i won't deny that
[19:32:08] <tw2114> js is master on the web.
[19:32:23] <tw2114> so it changed the world because the web is almost everywhere
[19:33:07] <tw2114> but many cannot really write core js and still can use js.
[19:33:26] <tw2114> can use jquery rather
[19:33:40] <tw2113> which is a shame, in many ways
[19:33:50] <tw2114> although jquery is js. so sort of an unfair statement but i think everyone understands
[19:34:14] <tw2113> danheberden, i went and purchased Resig's book earlier
[19:34:52] <tw2114> could become messy one day.
[19:36:51] <tw2114> i remember interviews before i learnt jquery when i would be asked about my knowledge of jquery and i would say it is limited. but in reality i created my own libraries which did similar things to jquery. so here i was someone who knew core js but not jquery and the interviewers really just wanted jquery skills.
[19:37:27] <tw2114> i did not care for jquery. i though bloat. but now... i really like it.
[19:37:39] <tw2114> it is awesome.
[19:38:42] <tw2114> i caved in. and my life has become easier .
[19:38:55] <tw2114> confessions
[19:39:21] <Foxhoundz> hello jQ
[19:39:49] <tw2114> is that jqlog you are referring to
[19:40:26] <tw2114> ok bye
[19:41:08] <Gavilan2> tw2114: O_o
[19:41:22] <jrajav> tw2113: Why would you ever say you don't know jquery
[19:41:34] <theCatIsBack> well i didn't
[19:41:42] <theCatIsBack> at the time
[19:41:48] <jrajav> It's literally just selectors - which you already know from CSS - and chained methods.
[19:41:52] <jrajav> What the methods do you can just google
[19:41:58] <jrajav> It takes all of five minutes to "learn" jquery
[19:42:06] <tw2113> jrajav, i think you meant that person with the tw2114 nick
[19:42:07] <tw2113> who left
[19:42:14] <jrajav> Are you not him? XD
[19:42:14] <theCatIsBack> i know now. super easy.
[19:42:18] <tw2113> no
[19:42:33] <Gavilan2> jrajav: Not really... It takes more than 5 minutes to learn how to use custom deferreds...
[19:42:57] <jrajav> Will they ask about custom deferreds in an interview though?
[19:43:01] <tw2113> learning basics of jquery/css is easy
[19:43:09] <tw2113> mastering either, takes time and effort
[19:43:27] <theCatIsBack> finesse
[19:43:31] <Gavilan2> jrajav: I don't mean to instul anyone but... Any interviewer who asks about jQuery is realyl stupid in my opinion.....
[19:43:34] <grafi> mastering everything tw2113 ;)
[19:44:07] <computerex> Hi Guys. jquery noob here, how do I get all the children using an id selector? I have an ol with id = "posts". I get it using $('#posts'). How do I get the children?
[19:44:15] <dcherman> jrajav: i would.  when someone says jquery, i want to know if they mean they just know how to select elements and maybe use ajax, or know a bit more.
[19:44:54] <theCatIsBack> write a plugin. debug someone elses plugin.
[19:44:58] <jrajav> dcherman: Why? I would think that it would be more valuable to know whether they can quickly learn, and produce good, well-structured code in general
[19:45:00] <computerex> $('#posts') I think returns a DOM object rather than a jQuery object..
[19:45:14] <theCatIsBack> jrajav i agree
[19:45:37] <jrajav> dcherman: Having experience with the language of the project is certainly useful (though the same argument could be made there), but down to the specific framework, too?
[19:45:41] <tw2113> computerex, $('#posts').children()
[19:45:48] <dcherman> jrajav: i don't disagree, but i probe about everything on someone's resume that i'm knowledgeable about - i want to know if you're trying to bullshit me
[19:46:01] <jrajav> Well if it's on their resume then yeah :P
[19:46:03] <dcherman> jrajav: if you list yourself as "expert in jquery", better be able to back it up.
[19:46:18] <jrajav> Okay, well that's different
[19:47:46] <Foxhoundz> computerex: .children()
[19:48:21] <computerex> I'm getting error: "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLOListElement] has no method 'children' "
[19:48:37] <computerex> with $('#posts').children()
[19:49:46] <computerex> alert($('#posts').children().length);  - I am trying to do that
[19:50:06] <BkaT> hello all. i'm getting an error - TypeError: context is null - when trying to retrieve an XML file via $.get. why could this be?
[19:50:12] <Foxhoundz> computerex: see this example: http://jsfiddle.net/S8yKs/
[19:50:45] <Foxhoundz> woops
[19:51:13] <tw2113> working for me computerex, i'm getting 4 for length in my quick example
[19:51:24] <Foxhoundz> That should be console.log($('#mary').children().text());
[19:51:29] <Foxhoundz> but yes
[19:51:45] <computerex> Hm.. Weird. I am writing a small script to delete all my tumblr posts..
[19:51:53] <computerex> inbox*
[19:52:15] <Foxhoundz> you can also use "#element > .directDescendant" to get it
[19:52:55] <BkaT> it actaully works if i set the dataType paramater in .get to text, but not with xml as the paramater
[19:53:39] <Gavilan2> dcherman: I'd consider myself an expert in jQuery, even though I don't have the slightest idea of how to use it...
[19:53:47] <Gavilan2> I'm an expert googler basically....
[19:54:15] <BkaT> i can solve most problems with a quick google too
[19:54:26] <BkaT> i come here when i am stumped
[19:54:37] <Gavilan2> BkaT: That's the first thing that my resume tells... Expert Googler....
[19:55:00] <dcherman> Gavilan2: well, if you made that claim on a resume and couldn't back it up, that's a bad thing.
[19:55:18] <computerex> http://jsfiddle.net/S8yKs/
[19:55:18] <computerex> Can someone tell me what's wrong here?
[19:55:22] <Gavilan2> dcherman: Give me google, and I'll back it up....
[19:56:04] <Wolfed> I have a slightly technical questions. Changes done to the DOM through jQuery/Javascript are not reflected in "View Page Source"?
[19:56:09] <computerex> whoops
[19:56:31] <dcherman> Gavilan2: if you said expert, i wouldn't be asking you "ok, how do you select blah and bind a handler", i'd be asking something like what are Deferreds and Promises and what benefit do they provide?
[19:56:44] <dblosevn> computerex: noting is wrong there lol
[19:56:52] <dblosevn> *nothing
[19:56:53] <computerex> http://jsfiddle.net/WuBQW/
[19:57:06] <computerex> I didn't hit fork :) sorry
[19:57:48] <Gavilan2> The Deferred object, introduced in jQuery 1.5, is a chainable utility object created by calling the jQuery.Deferred() method. It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.
[19:57:48] <Gavilan2> The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.
[19:57:58] <Gavilan2> In computer science, future, promise, and delay refer to constructs used for synchronizing in some concurrent programming languages. They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is yet incomplete.
[19:57:58] <Gavilan2> The term promise was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise,[1] and Peter Hibbard called it eventual.[2] A somewhat similar concept future was introduced in 1977 in a paper by Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt.[3]
[19:57:58] <Gavilan2> The terms future, promise, and delay are often used interchangeably, although some differences in usage between future and promise are treated below. Setting the value of a future is also called resolving, fulfilling, or binding it.
[19:58:10] <jrajav> Holy channel paste batman
[19:58:13] <jrajav> Kill it with fire
[19:58:23] <Foxhoundz> computerex: there's nothing wrong with it. It should return 3, the number of child li's it would find
[19:58:27] <coldhead> that certainly clears things up for m
[19:58:28] <coldhead> e
[19:58:29] <Foxhoundz> you're just not displaying it
[19:58:42] <Gavilan2> dcherman: Any doubts?
[19:58:42] <Foxhoundz> computerex: you can iterate through each descendant child if you want
[19:58:51] <BkaT> when you use .get to retrive an xml file and set the dataType paramater as 'xml', is it required that the XML be validated?
[19:58:57] <Foxhoundz> or if you want a single element out of the li tags, you can simply use it's ID, which you attached
[19:59:19] <Foxhoundz> its*
[19:59:44] <dcherman> Gavilan2: yep.  that'd be a no-hire for me personally.
[20:00:20] <Gavilan2> dcherman: Snif!!! But I need to eat!

[20:00:44] <limpc> hi, i have a div which holds an image. the div also contains another div with absolute positioning, which holds some buttons.  that inner div toolbar is set to display: none;.  I have .live() events on the container div which toggles the toolbar on mouseenter. however this has a negative effect when you mouseover the toolbar - the container div's mouseleave is fired. how do i prevent this?
[20:00:49] <Gavilan2> dcherman: What if I told you I was an expert yahooer too?
[20:01:33] <computerex> http://jsfiddle.net/sTTqL/
[20:01:33] <computerex> For some reason it outputs "undefined"
[20:01:55] <computerex> I'm sorry for the noobiness, I am a C programmer :)
[20:02:10] <limpc> computerex: $(this) instead of el
[20:02:18] <BkaT> :(
[20:03:26] <computerex> uhh, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/aXbh2/

[20:05:28] <Gavilan2> computerex: Use the second parameter of the function, not the first one

[20:05:45] <computerex> $(this).attr()
[20:05:46] <Foxhoundz> I just had an epiphany
[20:05:57] <Foxhoundz> does jQuery have a method for outerHTML?
[20:05:59] <Foxhoundz> o_o
[20:06:09] <Gavilan2> nope, it doesnt
[20:06:11] <limpc> innie or outtie? :)
[20:06:27] <Foxhoundz> odd

[20:07:59] <Foxhoundz> Gavilan2: MDN says all major browsers have basic support for it
[20:08:04] <Wolfed> Nope, just storing some $(#id).val() on variables
[20:08:27] <zCoder> can anyone please tell me why alert comes up undefined ? http://pastebin.com/zderW89p
[20:08:28] <Gavilan2> Foxhoundz: Then use element.outerHtml :p what do you need jquery for?
[20:08:35] <Wolfed> The code is similar to the one I use numerous times on my website, its just on this part that it doesnt work.
[20:08:50] <Foxhoundz> Gavilan2: that could be said for the entire framework, no? ;)
[20:09:12] <Gavilan2> Foxhoundz: JQuery purpose is mainly to make things work in any browser...
[20:09:26] <Gavilan2> It doesn't provide that many "high level abstractions" that the browserse don't offer....
[20:10:03] <Foxhoundz> it also tries to normalize the nuances between browsers
[20:10:34] <zCoder> If anyone is able, please help with my issue above. Thanks.   it should have the url instead it comes up undefined. thanks
[20:14:18] <zCoder> No one knows?
[20:14:24] <Wolfed> It doesnt seem to work on any browsers.
[20:16:40] <zCoder> someone's gotta know why this is happenign
[20:17:38] <tw2113> zCoder, jsfiddles are better for debugging js issues
[20:21:19] <computerex> aha.
[20:23:36] <computerex> I got it working, thanks :) It was a mix up.. Ugh.
[20:24:00] <computerex> What's the safest way of calling jQuery, using $ or jQuery?
[20:24:15] <tw2113> jQuery is more guaranteed and conflict free
[20:24:40] <tw2113> but it's nice to use the alias when you can
[20:25:37] <computerex> Why the hell does prototype use $$, Javascript uses $. I am reading about other mix ups too
[20:25:47] <computerex> jQuery*, not javascript
[20:26:19] <iheartjs> computerex, one trick is to enclose your code in a function and pass jQuery to that function as $
[20:26:29] <tw2113> because they all had the same idea?
[20:26:33] <tw2113> because they wanted the $$
[20:26:45] <tw2113> because they secretly love PHP's method for variables?
[20:28:17] <Gavilan2> computerex: (function($){ /* your stuff here */})(jQuery);
[20:31:23] <Wolfed> Just in case anyone can give me a hand: http://jsfiddle.net/n6bqh/ That code doesnt work on my website but does on jsfiddle.
[20:31:45] <zCoder> can anyone please tell me why alert comes up undefined ? http://pastebin.com/zderW89p
[20:32:12] <Wolfed> zCoder, try using jsfiddle for javascript. Easier to track down issues.
[20:34:45] <computerex> This is so cool :) I have a bookmark which loads a script I have in dropbox.
[20:35:52] <computerex> And I for some reason assumed $$ was for jQuery too, so I was calling Prototype instead of jQuery
[20:36:02] <dcope> Hey all, any reason why clicking the Cancel button on a file upload would make it appear twice? I'm using prettyfile.js... https://gist.github.com/9a9bcba9c23d936d282c
[20:36:43] <dcope> it happens whenever i have more than one pretty file on my page
[20:38:59] <jkt_alone> hi all can you help me with jquery.
[20:39:31] <jkt_alone> im trying to remove element but it still on my page
[20:41:07] <jkt_alone> anyone pls?
[20:44:01] <tw2113> jkt_alone, some sort of code sample would help a lot more
[20:47:04] <jkt_alone> 	echo "<script>
[20:47:04] <jkt_alone> 			$('#rm').submit(function() {
[20:47:06] <jkt_alone> 			var gile = $('td').val();
[20:47:08] <jkt_alone> 		$.ajax({
[20:47:10] <jkt_alone> 			type: 'POST',
[20:47:11] <jkt_alone> 			url: $(this).attr('action'),
[20:47:13] <jkt_alone> 			data: $(this).serializeArray(),
[20:47:14] <jkt_alone> 			success: function(data) {
[20:47:16] <jkt_alone> 				$('div[id*=\"myModal\"]').modal('hide');
[20:47:18] <jkt_alone> 				$('#result').html(data);
[20:47:20] <jkt_alone> 				$('tr').remove(\":contains(gile)\");
[20:47:21] <coldhead> SWEET PASTE BRO
[20:47:22] <jkt_alone> 			}
[20:47:23] <jkt_alone> 		})
[20:47:25] <jkt_alone> 		return false;
[20:47:26] <jkt_alone> 	});";
[20:47:28] <jkt_alone> 	echo '</script>';
[20:47:30] <jkt_alone> sorry :(
[20:47:36] <coldhead> oh wow it's even got PHP
[20:47:54] <jkt_alone> im newbie
[20:48:02] <tw2113> we noticed
[20:48:19] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery, jkt_alone
[20:48:45] <dcope> jesus
[20:49:07] <jkt_alone> i want to remove '<td>' which user click. and the '<td>' is dynamically count depend on database. i just don't know how to implement this. :(
[20:49:23] <jkt_alone> and sorry for my english
[20:52:51] <jkt_alone> is it the right time to ask stupid question like that?
[20:54:04] <tw2113> there's timeframes for certain types of questions?
[21:02:00] <hateIE10> http://www.unitystreams.com/zen-player/play2.html  <-- would some please care to explain this behavior in IE10 and confirm if that is working in IE 9
[21:04:16] <hateIE10> that is jPlayer.. I have had reports that it is indeed working in IE9 but that is JPLAYERS example, I have no idea if it fell back on flash/swf to do it biddings... so I am suspecting this E_URL crap is some crossdomain IE 10 security muck?
[21:05:20] <hateIE10> <furstrated />
[21:07:06] <hateIE10> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11386696/jplayer-url-verification
[21:10:07] <hateIE10> fark me
[21:11:11] <hateIE10> jPlayers Docs are frankly shit
[21:13:48] <hateIE10> "Error with media URL"  - totally un helpfull  .. does not explain how its supposed to be working IE 9.. unless my theory of it not using HTMl5 at all is correct and because IE10 wont crossdomain the swf fallback that is the real issue
[21:16:15] <hateIE10> chances are I am right.. so fuck you m$ and army of shity twat programmers I am going to shit down there necks and piss on their graves if i ever got hold of them.. jesus christ even hitler did not make life such a fucking mysery
[21:16:41] <limpc> i have a div which holds an image. the div also contains another div with absolute positioning, which holds some buttons.  that inner div toolbar is set to display: none;.  I have .live() events on the container div which toggles the toolbar on mouseenter. however this has a negative effect when you mouseover the toolbar - the container div's mouseleave is fired. how do i prevent this?
[21:21:10] <hateIE10> i think you might need .preventDefault
[21:26:22] <limpc> well i want the mouseleave to fire, but not when it's over the button toolbar.. im not sure how to do that
[21:26:44] <BkaT> set the button toolbar to have opposite functionality
[21:34:52] <limpc> opposite? wont that cause a race condition?
[21:43:38] <xsamurai> can somebody check if this http://jsfiddle.net/Y9mSw/ is the correct way to have an either or selection setup ?
[21:46:53] <limpc> ah i found the problem
[21:47:18] <limpc> it was due to me cycling images. the mouseenter/mouseleave was also on the image. just needed to change that to the container div instead
[21:51:52] <thinkerweb> http://jsfiddle.net/eNNGz/
[21:53:18] <thinkerweb> I got rid of .button() and it works, but wierd thing is in another script, I had to add the button() command to get it working for some reason.
[21:53:34] <meelu> anyone about?
[21:53:51] <Cork> thinkerweb: you should bind submit on the form, not click on the button
[21:56:04] <thinkerweb> Cork, what do you mean? I think I know, <button type="submit>?  Thing is I don't want the form to actually submit cause I wanna use ajax.  Get rid of the form all together then eh?
[21:57:15] <Cork> thinkerweb: http://jsfiddle.net/eNNGz/1/
[21:58:33] <thinkerweb> Cork, I see, .button() submit the form eh
[21:58:48] <Cork> thinkerweb: no but <button> does
[22:01:46] <thinkerweb> Cork, so then why do I need this line if the button submits the form anyway: $('#loginForm').button();
[22:02:04] <Cork> thinkerweb: i thought you wanted to theme it with jquery ui
[22:02:10] <Cork> cause thats what it does
[22:02:45] <thinkerweb> Cork, oooooooh, .button() was for jquery, now I remember why I had that in there
[22:02:54] <Cork> no not jquery
[22:02:56] <thinkerweb> Cork, jquery ui I mean
[22:02:57] <Cork> jquery-ui
[22:03:00] <thinkerweb> yep
[22:03:40] <Cork> my point with the change was that you should always use the submit on the form, instead of click on buttons
[22:03:41] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/Z5Gv7/ ok i have an issue ... this works but the animations is jumpy (type 2222 in the inputbox) I tried using keypress or keydown and the animation isnt so jumpy but it leaves 4 digits behind the rightmost comma
[22:04:01] <veQue> what gives?
[22:04:04] <veQue> how to fix?
[22:04:06] <thinkerweb> Cork, I see what you mean. Thanks
[22:04:49] <Cork> veQue: http://jsfiddle.net/Z5Gv7/1/
[22:04:50] <thinkerweb> Cork, but what if I get rid of the form completely cause I plan on using ajax(): http://jsfiddle.net/eNNGz/3/
[22:05:13] <Cork> thinkerweb: if you have input fields you should have a form
[22:05:23] <veQue> Cork you genius. iowe you one
[22:05:36] <Cork> but ya, if you only need a button, then you can skip the form
[22:05:38] <thinkerweb> Cork, hmm, yeah cause I am gonna want the POST array
[22:05:58] <Cork> veQue: yw
[22:06:34] <thinkerweb> Cork, its bad practice not to use a form, cause I could get the value using .val() too
[22:07:00] <Cork> thinkerweb: not really, just use serialize or serializeArray
[22:07:22] <Cork> but like i said, if you plan to have input/select/textarea fields you should use a form
[22:07:56] <thinkerweb> Cork, ok, but for some reason, I didnt' like using preventDefault()
[22:08:08] <Cork> thinkerweb: why not?
[22:08:21] <thinkerweb> Cork, yeah, you are right, there is no good reason, I am just being stupid
[22:08:26] <Cork> it's the best way to make events work like they should
[22:09:02] <raj> hola Cork, gotta question :)
[22:09:03] <thinkerweb> Cork, but with ajax, I will be passing the value directly anyway, so what the point in using a form
[22:09:34] <Cork> $('form').serialize(), and the form makes ex. enter submit the form and other actions
[22:09:42] <raj> in this documentation, it says for ".rename ( node )" that after the user enters the change, an event is triggered --> http://www.jstree.com/documentation/crrm
[22:09:45] <Cork> like from auto fill and things like that don't work without the form tag
[22:09:49] <raj> but how am I supposed to get ahold of that event?
[22:09:51] <raj> or listen for that event
[22:09:57] <raj> i don't see it say anywhere what the event is
[22:10:23] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your lives
[22:11:00] <thinkerweb> Cork, I will look up serialize then, thx
[22:11:17] <thinkerweb> Cork, I can use serialize with ajax right
[22:11:18] <Cork> thinkerweb: have a look at serializeArray too
[22:11:25] <Cork> thinkerweb: thats what its for
[22:11:44] <Cork> raj: do you have a link to the library?
[22:14:17] <raj> Cork, I got it, it should be rename.jstree
[22:14:28] <raj> .on('rename.jstree', ...)
[22:14:39] <Cork> just rename should work
[22:14:43] <raj> what does rlbk stand for, btw?
[22:14:47] <Cork> the rest is just a namescope
[22:15:15] <raj> but jstree works within that scope only though, no?
[22:15:38] <Cork> raj: just goessing but rlbk = this.get_rollback();
[22:15:52] <Cork> raj: no its a scope for removing a set of listners
[22:16:21] <raj> oh
[22:16:22] <Cork> on('rename.my-scope') on('rename.other-scope'), on('rename.jstree') on('rename')
[22:16:30] <Cork> trigger('rename') will trigger all of them
[22:16:36] <raj> ohh, very interesting
[22:16:44] <Cork> but off('.jstree') will only remove rename.jstree
[22:16:54] <Cork> same with off('rename.jstree')
[22:17:14] <Cork> off('rename') will remove all of them
[22:17:17] <raj> understood
[22:17:21] <raj> thank you for that :)
[22:17:26] <Cork> np
[22:17:44] <raj> within rlbk, it has 3 keys, 'd','h', and 'i'
[22:17:47] <raj> i is index
[22:17:56] <raj> not sure about d or h though
[22:18:35] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/wYPHGywjQQKuBfvGygQ2bc
[22:28:18] <thinkerweb> Cork, Why they put the return false; line in there? http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:28:42] <Cork> ugg...
[22:29:00] <Cork> thinkerweb: its a bad example, its an old way of preventing the default action
[22:29:09] <Cork> but it breaks other event listeners so its a bad idea
[22:30:07] <Cork> thinkerweb: return false; breaks the event loop so no more events will be triggered (at all), (that includes bubbling, and the default action)
[22:30:18] <Cork> event.preventDefault() stop the browser default action
[22:30:32] <Cork> event.stopPropagation() stops the even from bubbling to parent element
[22:30:49] <Cork> thats the relation between those three
[22:31:18] <thinkerweb> Cork, thx
[22:31:19] <Palanivel> @Cork i have clarification...... i have a one json like {
[22:31:20] <Palanivel> 	"json" : [
[22:31:22] <Palanivel> 		{
[22:31:24] <Palanivel> 			"obj1id" : "123",
[22:31:25] <Palanivel> 			"objname" : "Palani"
[22:31:26] <Palanivel> 		},
[22:31:28] <Palanivel> 		{
[22:31:30] <Palanivel> 			"obj1id" : "123",
[22:31:31] <Palanivel> 			"objname" : "Palani"
[22:31:31] <Cork> ...
[22:31:33] <Palanivel> 		}
[22:31:34] <Palanivel> 	]
[22:31:36] <Palanivel> }
[22:31:37] <Palanivel>  and i am going to change json[1].objname = "vel" but if i am doing like this both the places changing........what is the issue
[22:31:42] <Cork> don't dump lines in the channel!
[22:31:59] <Palanivel> Ok  wont here after
[22:32:00] <Cork> use a pb if you want to include things like that
[22:32:06] <thinkerweb> Cork, ajax expects the serialize format, so that's the one I'll use, serializeArray produces json formatting which is gonna come into use one day for me eh
[22:32:22] <zChris> is there an easy way to collect all divs with attribute value and then get the value that is the highest?
[22:32:31] <Palanivel> may i know what is the problem
[22:32:33] <Palanivel> ????
[22:33:58] <Cork> js> var json = [ { "obj1id" : "123", "objname" : "Palani" }, { "obj1id" : "123", "objname" : "Palani" } ]; json[1].objname= "works"; print(JSON.stringify(json))
[22:34:00] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[22:34:06] <Cork> O_o
[22:34:06] <thinkerweb> Cork, should I include type="submit" for my button as in <button type="submit">Log in</button> ?
[22:34:38] <Cork> Palanivel: so unless your actually working with json, that should work
[22:34:57] <Cork> thinkerweb: its up to you, its the default action for buttons in forms
[22:35:15] <Cork> sorry default type
[22:35:21] <thinkerweb> Cork, its redundant I see.
[22:35:52] <thinkerweb> Cork, I've seen it somewhere, but if its default behavious seems silly to include it
[22:35:56] <Palanivel> @Cork....it's replacing both the objects(places)
[22:38:39] <Cork> zChris: var match = $('div[name]'); var target = $.map(match, function(elm) { return $(elm).attr('name'); }).sort()[0]; match.filter(function() { return $(this).attr('name') === target; });
[22:39:12] <Cork> Palanivel: i would have to have an example of your code
[22:39:31] <Palanivel> Ok i got
[22:39:36] <Palanivel> thank you
[22:39:52] <Cork> zChris: oh wait you said highist, that one is lowest...
[22:40:35] <Forrestr> Has anyone here used xeditable? And do you know if it's possible to change the transition on the mouseleave? Not seeing it in the docs and wondering if anyone has done something like that
[22:47:25] <raj> Cork, does it disgust you that major websites like gmail, yahoo, and facebook all have console errors?
[22:48:08] <Cork> raj: well it disgust me more that they have invalid html
[22:48:46] <zChris> I have a <tr name='data' value='1'> but alert( $('tr[name=data]').prop('value') ) gives me undefined?
[22:48:53] <zChris> How am i suppose to retrieve that value?
[22:48:55] <thinkerweb> Cork, re: http://jsfiddle.net/eNNGz/1/ , if we have multiple forms on a page, then use $("#form-id") instead?
[22:49:19] <Cork> zChris: tr does't have name or value attributes, thats for form fields
[22:49:41] <Cork> zChris: if you want to store data on your dom elements use data-<something>
[22:49:44] <zChris> Cork, retrieving name works though
[22:49:53] <raj> how in the world do these things get by qc?
[22:49:57] <Cork> zChris: ya, but its invalid
[22:50:16] <Cork> raj: they don't care
[22:50:18] <Cork> "it works"
[22:50:23] <zChris> exactly :P
[22:50:50] <raj> sad
[22:50:54] <Cork> zChris: but thats a really bad idea, cause your depending on error correction, and if it differs from what you expect, your page breaks
[22:51:25] <Cork> zChris: and using arbitrary taken attribute names on dom elements is even worse
[22:51:37] <Cork> cause if the browser implement a feature that uses that name, your page breaks
[22:51:45] <zChris> Cork, well i have changed it too data-name now
[22:51:46] <Cork> thats why the data- namespace was added
[22:51:53] <zChris> and data-value
[22:51:56] <Cork> nice
[22:52:13] <Cork> oh, and those are attr's not props
[22:52:31] <zChris> Cork, well i tried attr but that gave undefined aswell. Gonna try on data- now
[22:52:32] <Cork> $('tr[data-name=data]').attr('value')
[22:52:40] <Cork> * $('tr[data-name=data]').attr('data-value')
[22:53:04] <thinkerweb> Cork, it doesn't work using form id.
[22:53:23] <Cork> thinkerweb: looking now
[22:53:29] <thinkerweb> If you one form, you can select using $("form"), but what if you have two or more forms on a single page?
[22:53:57] <Cork> thinkerweb: http://jsfiddle.net/eNNGz/4/
[22:54:08] <thinkerweb> I don't know how to select except with id's/class's $("form []")
[22:54:28] <zChris> Cork, thanks it works now :)
[22:54:45] <thinkerweb> Cork, hmm, it does work, I thought it didn't, I must have made another error somewhere. Thx
[22:54:52] <Cork> zChris: and actually now when your using data- you can do $('tr[data-name=data]').data('value')
[22:55:21] <zChris> Cork, alright :)
[22:56:12] <thinkerweb> Can hazard a guess on if its faster using $("form") or $("#formID") ?
[22:56:30] <thinkerweb> I'm guessing using an id would be faster
[22:57:11] <Gavilan2> thinkerweb: I wouldn't be so sure...
[22:57:16] <Cork> speed is: #id > .class >>> element >>> element[attribute] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>< element:container()
[22:57:32] <Cork> the number or arrows is kinda to explain the difference in speed
[22:57:35] <Gavilan2>  element:container() what is that?
[22:57:47] <Cork> a jquery function
[22:57:59] <Cork> opps sorry
[22:57:59] <Gavilan2> what?
[22:58:01] <Cork> *contains
[22:58:13] <Gavilan2> contains? like *=?
[22:58:16] <Cork> no
[22:58:28] <Cork> it checks if whats inside () matches children of the element
[22:58:47] <Gavilan2> ok
[22:58:51] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[22:59:05] <Gavilan2> Cork: Do you know if that's true for a style sheet too?
[22:59:15] <Cork> but as it can't be done fast in the dom (and is why the browser doesn't support it directly) its horribly slow
[22:59:17] <Gavilan2> or does the browser precalculates all the styles and shit?
[22:59:21] <Cork> Gavilan2: no
[22:59:29] <Gavilan2> no what?
[22:59:43] <Cork> its not supported outside of jquery selectors
[22:59:48] <Gavilan2> Cork: I meant the others
[22:59:53] <Gavilan2> #id > .class >>> element >>> element[attribute]
[22:59:56] <Cork> yes
[22:59:58] <Gavilan2> is that also true in a style sheet?
[23:00:12] <Cork> that is based on how the browsers stores lookup tables
[23:00:20] <Cork> #id is id's in a hash table
[23:00:21] <Gavilan2> Is there any information about that?
[23:00:28] <Cork> so its more or less direct memory pointers
[23:00:32] <Gavilan2> what is faster?  .blah or #something .blah?
[23:00:34] <Cork> so its super fast
[23:00:43] <Cork> Gavilan2: the less relation the faster
[23:00:51] <Gavilan2> what do you mean less relation?
[23:01:11] <Cork> selectior selector > selector * selector + selector
[23:01:18] <Cork> ^ element relations
[23:01:22] <Gavilan2> what?
[23:01:34] <Gavilan2> $(".blah") or $("#something .blah") assuming both return the same thing
[23:01:36] <Gavilan2> which one is faster?
[23:01:44] <Cork> i just answered that
[23:01:50] <Cork> Gavilan2: the less relation the faster <--
[23:01:50] <Gavilan2> $("#something > .blah") and that one too
[23:02:05] <Gavilan2> I don't understand your answer
[23:02:28] <Cork> the less relation to its siblings and parents you express in your selector, the faster it is
[23:02:51] <Gavilan2> Cork: so ".justTheClass" is better?
[23:02:55] <Cork> yes
[23:03:03] <Gavilan2> okay...
[23:03:07] <Gavilan2> and what about the parent thing like
[23:03:23] <Cork> what do you mean?
[23:03:46] <Gavilan2>  $("#something > data-something=blah") vs  $("data-something=blah")
[23:03:52] <Gavilan2> There I'd assume that the first one is faster
[23:04:00] <Cork> none of those are valid selectors
[23:04:07] <Gavilan2> sorry
[23:04:18] <Gavilan2>  $("#something > [data-something=blah]") vs  $("[data-something=blah]")
[23:04:25] <Cork> Gavilan2: and yes, as your limiting it to an id' and its children its faster
[23:04:36] <Cork> cause attribute selectors is comparably slow
[23:04:44] <Gavilan2> is there any onlie web page or thing that has a table with all those things?
[23:05:01] <Cork> all possible selectors, or there speed?
[23:05:09] <Gavilan2> some guidelines at least
[23:05:20] <Cork> i don't know of any online documentation for the the speed
[23:05:25] <Gavilan2> and final question... do you know how much faster is #id vs .class?
[23:05:31] <Cork> but the selectors is listed on w3c's doc
[23:05:36] <Gavilan2> 2x, 3x, 10x, 100x?
[23:05:45] <Cork> < 2x
[23:05:50] <Gavilan2> k, thx
[23:06:06] <Cork> id was a LOT faster if you go back many years
[23:06:08] <Gavilan2> that's useful to know...
[23:06:25] <Gavilan2> so PCs are getting slower!!! I knew it!
[23:06:26] <Cork> but then they added hash tables for classes too, and now its just the difference of multiple values
[23:06:48] <Cork> Gavilan2: i meant id's was a lot faster then classes
[23:06:56] <Gavilan2> I know... I was kidding....
[23:07:00] <Cork> its not that id's got slower :)
[23:07:27] <Gavilan2> Final question... what's faster... to have two style sheets, and disable one or the other...
[23:07:45] <Cork> and those hash tables is why you should only use id and classes for actually identifing the element
[23:07:48] <Gavilan2> or to have one stylesheet with body.layout-1 whatever   and body.layout-2 wathever
[23:07:52] <Gavilan2> and change the body class?
[23:08:32] <Cork> Gavilan2: best answer is prob to explain how the lookup works in browsers
[23:08:49] <Cork> body.layout-1 #myelement
[23:09:20] <Cork> that hits an element that has the id #myelement, then it travels up the dom tree looking for a parent that matches body.layout-1
[23:09:28] <Cork> testing each parent as it goes
[23:09:58] <Cork> Gavilan2: that said, the class on body is most of the time not a problem, but if you have big pages, it can be
[23:10:17] <Gavilan2> so, disable/enabling the sheets will be faster?
[23:10:44] <Cork> and loading a separate stylesheet has the downside of file parsing, network latency
[23:10:53] <yefim323> #ubuntu
[23:10:57] <Cork> and you still trigger a full reflow of the page (thats manly whats slow)
[23:11:14] <Gavilan2> k
[23:11:18] <Gavilan2> another question...
[23:11:30] <Cork> Gavilan2: but i haven't really looked into the speed for those two, but i would expect the class to be faster
[23:11:32] <Gavilan2> is there any difference in speed between a real .css file and a <style> tag?
[23:11:48] <Cork> load speed
[23:11:57] <evilaim> So, I'm a complete newb at jquery.  I've done some forms stuff and scroll bar, but I'd like to know how advanced I can get with this.
[23:12:02] <Gavilan2> My concern is after the page has loaded....
[23:12:06] <Cork> as the .css file is already in cache you don't have to send it over and over again
[23:12:16] <Gavilan2> I have 5 "css" that I use for animations
[23:12:23] <Gavilan2> and I need them to be applied extremelly quickly
[23:12:25] <evilaim> I'd like to have a screen, where I click and drag one object to another, and soon as I release the mouse, a login/password field comes up.
[23:12:29] <evilaim> Is this a Jquery deal?
[23:12:33] <Gavilan2> (Only 1 of the "css" is active at each time)
[23:13:01] <Gavilan2> I can put body.layout1 body.layout2 body.layout3 or have completely separated style sheets
[23:14:06] <Gavilan2> BTW: what about :root.layout1?
[23:14:14] <Gavilan2> would that be faster than body.layout1 or not?
[23:14:43] <Cork> then you should have a server script to combind the css files
[23:15:10] <Cork> the cost of loading multiple files will outreach all other
[23:15:31] <Gavilan2> I don't care about the initial loading time...
[23:15:37] <Gavilan2> My only concern is the execution time....
[23:15:50] <Cork> you would have to benchmark it
[23:15:57] <Gavilan2> If I put all the css as <style> it would be just 1 file
[23:16:01] <Gavilan2> with 5 <style> tags
[23:16:01] <Cork> cause it all depends on the structure of your page, what works best
[23:16:21] <evilaim> So, anyone?
[23:16:28] <Gavilan2> k, thnks
[23:16:39] <evilaim> I want to create an easy puzzle, once solved it should load the login/password fields...
[23:16:42] <evilaim> Ideas?
[23:16:50] <Gavilan2> Cork: So what do you tink? :root.layout1 or body.layout1?
[23:17:12] <Cork> evilaim: could be done with draggable
[23:17:36] <Cork> Gavilan2: :root isn't a valid selector as far as i know
[23:18:04] <evilaim> Yea, that's not too bad
[23:18:05] <Gavilan2> Cork: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/
[23:18:42] <Cork> Gavilan2: most likely slower, but wouldn't know
[23:19:10] <Cork> also doesn't have the best compatibility with browsers
[23:19:21] <Gavilan2> Cork: So anyway what about #layout-1 .myClass vs .layout-1 .myClass vs html.layout-1 .myClas vs body.layout-1 .myClas
[23:19:43] <Gavilan2> vs html#layout-1 .myClass vs body#layout-1 .myClass
[23:19:43] <Cork> Gavilan2: i've already answered that...
[23:19:52] <Gavilan2> but I added new options...
[23:20:10] <Cork> and the answer is just a combination of what i've already said
[23:20:35] <Cork> element#id is just dumb, as it takes an unspecific selector, and then filters with an uniq selector
[23:20:52] <lad> when I remove my "Virtual Tabs" from my website (http://www.lolplanet.net/), my panels work. however, if I don't remove the virtual tabs, my panels don't work!!!! what should I do? http://pastebin.com/bWCmkQV7
[23:33:19] <thinkerweb> when you use .ajax() with php, the way you get a response is using ' echo "you response"; '.  Is there another way?
[23:34:37] <Cork> thinkerweb: no
[23:34:56] <Cork> though if you want to send structured data use json_encode
[23:36:41] <thinkerweb> Cork, thx, hmm, I'm not getting anything back from my class.  The url: script.php is working fine, but then I call a class using new classname, and the echo's in that class are being received.
[23:37:27] <thinkerweb> Cork, you know what, maybe I will make a variable and then echo that instead.
[23:45:09] <thinkerweb> as soon as I do $someClass = new mySomeClass(); ajax breaks.
