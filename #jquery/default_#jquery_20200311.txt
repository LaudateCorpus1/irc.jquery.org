[13:23:33] <Rockwood> syntax error i am facing
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood with what little you have there, i'm not sure if data is a function or what.
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> .fail(function(data) { /* your code here */ });
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> just like anything else.
[13:25:30] <Rockwood> k
[13:25:32] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/htfvj
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah - pass in a function
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> like I just showed you.
[13:27:24] <Rockwood> k
[15:27:13] <lupulo> could i create two input one with type=range and another with type=number synchronized?
[15:27:22] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:28:32] <robertmaxrees> gg
[15:30:18] <robertmaxrees> lupulo ^^
[23:33:42] <Rockwood> hi anyactive?
[23:36:22] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask - just ask your question :) if anybody can help, they will.
[23:39:40] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood ^^
[23:42:31] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/VVYk6
[23:42:45] <robertmaxrees> And your question?
[23:42:47] <Rockwood> its works only single time
[23:43:02] <robertmaxrees> what does?
[23:43:36] <Rockwood> actually i am chk email id is exist in DB
[23:43:40] <Rockwood> chking
[23:43:48] <robertmaxrees> ??
[23:43:51] <Rockwood> i am testing
[23:44:03] <Rockwood> its works only 2 times
[23:44:27] <Rockwood> on 3 third is not change class
[23:44:32] <Rockwood> changing
[23:45:12] <robertmaxrees> first off
[23:45:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't need ajaxSetup here.
[23:45:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pj96cxLs/
[23:45:44] <robertmaxrees> do this instead.
[23:45:44] <Rockwood> then how chk DB
[23:46:04] <robertmaxrees> actually you want https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pj96cxLs/3/
[23:46:07] <robertmaxrees> prop instead of attr
[23:46:27] <robertmaxrees> second off - check your network tab.  what's going on with the request?  is it succeeding?  throwing an error?
[23:47:36] <robertmaxrees> oh also do var $this = $(this);
[23:47:49] <Rockwood> k
[23:48:34] <robertmaxrees> also: use .data().  and since you're already storing $(this) in a var, just use $this everywhere else: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pj96cxLs/6/
[23:49:56] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, i am chking mysql's email exist i think ajax only the way to do that
[23:50:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:50:18] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with anything I've mentioned here? :)
[23:50:37] <Rockwood> then catch is similar?
[23:50:57] <Rockwood> on response
[23:50:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[23:51:05] <Rockwood> ok
[23:51:08] <robertmaxrees> only the newer, "smarter" way to handle those.
[23:51:13] <Rockwood> okay
[23:51:48] <Rockwood> one more point is in my mind
[23:52:06] <Rockwood> brb 10 mints
[23:52:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:52:16] <robertmaxrees> did you even check the network tab?
