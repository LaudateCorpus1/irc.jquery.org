[09:06:39] <fas3r> Hello
[09:07:55] <fas3r> How to get the selected value of an array of input type radio button which have the same name ?  I tried $("#myform").find('input[name="usage"]:checked').val() but it does not seems to be correct
[09:07:56] <fas3r> thanks
[10:55:54] <yakari> hi
[12:28:43] <hellyeah> finally
[12:28:58] <hellyeah> i am here
[12:38:10] <poie> How to download image from URL to Desktop with pad ?
[12:52:47] <poboy> how would I toggle this where if they click a different "a" tag then this one is no longer red?
[12:52:49] <poboy> $(document).on('click', ".open_service", function() {     $(this).closest("a").css({"color": "red"}); });
[12:54:46] <poboy> like, can you say "I want the other a tags to be color:black
[13:26:48] <hellyeah> poboy,  you should fiddle your intension
[13:36:39] <oisud> How can I download image from URL ?
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> oisud could you provide a little more context?
[13:40:22] <oisud> robertmaxrees: i want to download image from a external server to a path on my desktop
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> that’s not really something you can do in your browser.
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> there may be extensions you could use.
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> but you can’t do that with just in-browser JS.
[13:42:09] <oisud> robertmaxrees: hmm so i need to use PHP for this
[13:42:37] <robertmaxrees> if you’re looking to automate it, yeah.  though be careful.
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> scraping web content is a bit of a grey area.  in some cases, it’s illegal.
[13:43:17] <oisud> robertmaxrees: its only for me to use
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> doesn’t really matter heh
[13:43:43] <poboy> ok, so there's a lot more going on but in this fiddle, when they click Document 1 it's red.  What I want is when they click Document 2 then it becomes red and Document 1 goes back to normal.  https://jsfiddle.net/vqtukahy/
[13:44:06] <robertmaxrees> poboy easy - use a class for the color
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> then do $(‘.red’).removeClass(‘red’); before you do what you’ve got there.
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> also poboy you don’t need .closest() there.
[13:45:04] <poboy> when I omit closest it makes all the A tags red
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?  doesn’t do that for me at all.
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> .closest() is just grabbing the .open_service you clicked on.
[13:45:39] <poboy> in the project it does
[13:45:51] <poboy> would probably take at least 1 hour to deconstruct everything for a proper fiddle
[13:45:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have nexted <a>s then.
[13:46:14] <poboy> yes, we use php and there is only one <a>, in a foreach loop
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:47:24] <robertmaxrees> either way, try that class trick out.
[13:57:14] <poboy> Ok, I've almost got it.  The syntax is wrong but how do I say <a> tags inside the .open_service class?  $(".open_service" "a").css({"color": "black"});
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> just like you would with CSS.
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> ‘.open_service a’
[13:58:07] <poboy> doh
[13:59:11] <poboy> got it, thanks for answering my dumb questions, robertmaxrees!
[13:59:35] <robertmaxrees> not dumb at all!
[14:29:15] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, do you prefer working in pure jquery or do you use frontend frameworks?
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> “pure jquery” lol
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> it really depends on the project.
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ why do you ask?
[14:31:39] <nikio_> because i do both , but i find it much easier and faster to work with just jquery
[14:31:50] <robertmaxrees> some of that is just experience.
[14:31:56] <nikio_> and possibly reuse components from before and adjust them to a new use case
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> that’s where frameworks come in handy.
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> like for a small one-off side thing?  i won’t even use jquery if it’s simple enough.
[14:32:56] <nikio_> also because the debugging is more comfortable, i like working with the chrome dev tools, debugging compiled angular code as an example, can be horrendous
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> source maps.
[14:33:11] <nikio_> yes #
[14:33:18] <nikio_> but still
[14:33:27] <robertmaxrees> you should be using webpack to bundle all your deps together fwiw.
[14:33:36] <nikio_> i just noticed, there are all these small annoying things that keep happening
[14:33:37] <robertmaxrees> that’s when source maps come in really handy.
[14:33:46] <nikio_> even when using source maps
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:34:00] <nikio_> just in general
[14:34:05] <robertmaxrees> source maps solve that problem.  exactly what they’re for :)
[14:34:06] <nikio_> throughout the whole project
[14:34:21] <nikio_> one time its something during the building
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:34:35] <nikio_> another time its some other weird problem
[14:35:02] <nikio_> things just tend to take longer, and weird things keep happening which then require time to solve
[14:35:12] <robertmaxrees> that’s programming heh
[14:35:33] <nikio_> yes i just feel that they happen more often when using a framework like angular
[14:35:48] <nikio_> with just jquery things seem to  be much simpler and faster
[14:35:49] <robertmaxrees> i haven’t had that experience at all (Shrug)
[14:35:55] <robertmaxrees> it’s all about the tradeoff.
[14:36:19] <robertmaxrees> if the project is large enough, the initial time investment on a library is well worth it.
[14:36:41] <robertmaxrees> it also pays off in dividends long-term because there’s an inherent structure imposed on the project.
[14:36:57] <nikio_> on a  library?
[14:37:12] <robertmaxrees> library/framework.
[14:37:38] <nikio_> ok. but you also  said you wont even use jquery when its simple enough
[14:37:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:38:09] <nikio_> so you use a framework when the project might be big
[14:38:16] <robertmaxrees> and jquery.
[14:38:28] <nikio_> and what do you use for a simple webapp?
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> backbone and jquery play nicely together.
[14:38:37] <robertmaxrees> depends on the project (shrug)
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> at work we use backbone, angular, react, riot...
[14:39:02] <robertmaxrees> every project is different.
[14:40:42] <nikio_> our company runs into the problem that we are using different frameworks libraries for different projects, which makes it harder to reuse components
[14:41:15] <robertmaxrees> therein lies the other consideration :)
[14:41:21] <robertmaxrees> it really depends on where you work.
[14:41:34] <robertmaxrees> i’m guessing you work at a web dev shop, yeah?
[14:42:00] <nikio_> shop? well no, its an IT startup, for now focusing on GIS related web applications
[14:42:59] <nikio_> i am the lead, and now im trying to figure out how i can make sure we can reuse things better
[14:43:15] <nikio_> i guess we need to chose our frameworks and stick with it
[14:43:17] <robertmaxrees> so in our case we have a ton of different frontend and backend sites.  we don’t really need to share much between, say, our order management system and our frontend stores.
[14:43:39] <robertmaxrees> i’d caution against a “WE’LL ALWAYS USE ANGULAR FOR ALL THE THINGS” approach fwiw.
[14:44:39] <nikio_> i havent experienced a situation yet where i could say, damn this framework would be better than this other framework for thisparticular use case
[14:44:47] <nikio_> for me they all seem to be able to the same things
[14:45:04] <nikio_> well
[14:45:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:45:15] <nikio_> i know react is more a view framework
[14:45:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:45:34] <robertmaxrees> react, angular, riot, backbone - all have VERY different opinions and strong points.
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> vue
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> etc
[14:46:22] <nikio_> i only used angular and studied react out of those
[14:46:49] <nikio_> but i read articles and forums that compare them
[14:46:50] <robertmaxrees> i’d explore some of the other options out there.  vue is popular right now.  backbone is still a thing.
[14:47:03] <nikio_> i read backbone is kinda dead
[14:47:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, I’d actually get experience in them to really develop opinions.
[14:47:53] <robertmaxrees> backbone is pretty stable right now.  i wouldn’t call it dead.
[14:48:25] <nikio_> do you prefer react over backbone? or are they really different
[14:48:35] <robertmaxrees> way different.
[14:48:58] <robertmaxrees> react’s philosophies and backbone’s philosophies are wildly different paradigms.
[14:51:12] <robertmaxrees> one really good example about how they differ - if I were to use react, I’d probably ditch jquery.
[14:52:17] <nikio_> i have developed pretty complex SPAs using just jquery, and i see that the way i solve things end up being similar to how frameworks do it, im sure it still needs a lot of improvement, but i love the idea of reusing my own components, or in a way end up with my own framework so to speak
[14:52:57] <nikio_> that way i dont carry around all the bloat, i can more easily finetune things, and learn more
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> the issue with your current approach is you’re repeating a lot of boilerplate.
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> also: bloat can be killed with a better build process.
[14:53:38] <robertmaxrees> also: what happens if you update a “component” in one app?  how do you update the others?
[14:53:57] <nikio_> yeh i still need to figure out how to do that
[14:54:10] <robertmaxrees> protip: don’t :)
[14:54:17] <robertmaxrees> that’s where frameworks come in handy.
[14:54:31] <robertmaxrees> build your own library of shared components in a module.
[14:54:35] <nikio_> well you could simply use soemthing like npm
[14:55:10] <robertmaxrees> sure.  but you’re still having to solve a problem you don’t need in the first place.
[14:55:19] <nikio_> and make sure your components play nicely with that
[14:56:58] <nikio_> one of the most promising webapps is an SPA written in jquery
[14:57:09] <nikio_> (our most promising webapps)
[14:57:32] <nikio_> i was considering transforming it into an angular pp
[14:57:40] <robertmaxrees> you should give that a shot.
[14:58:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a great library for dom manipulation - as soon as I hear somebody saying they “wrote” something in it I get nervous heh
[14:59:02] <nikio_> but i havent fell in love with angular yet, i dont know other frameworks, and my boss wont be to keen on going for yet another framework.. he doesnt like it because we are  a small start up and its rare to find devs that can work with different frameworks
[14:59:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:59:25] <robertmaxrees> so first off - you’ll need to change that mindset.
[15:01:27] <nikio_> which?  not willing to try different frameworks for different projects? I think its a valid concern though
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> actually, both.
[15:01:56] <nikio_> he wants to hire one extra dev now, it will be easier to find one if the only requirement is angular,
[15:02:08] <nikio_> and not say: react + angular
[15:02:13] <robertmaxrees> you should be comfortable to try things to see what fits best.
[15:02:28] <robertmaxrees> and just because a developer isn’t versed in a framework doesn’t mean they’re not a kick-ass dev :)
[15:03:12] <nikio_> i personally love trying different things,  and i wouldnt mind having to work with different frameworks
[15:03:30] <nikio_> but i would have to convince the boss somehow that is ok to do that
[15:03:53] <robertmaxrees> let’s re-frame it: what’s his contention?>
[15:03:59] <nikio_> but, the budget is small, we cant get awesome devs
[15:04:30] <robertmaxrees> heh, sounds like they’re pinching pennies, don’t wanna hire skilled devs, and are expecting the business to really take off.
[15:04:53] <nikio_> its just one person ;) the boss
[15:05:25] <robertmaxrees> still.
[15:05:26] <nikio_> then its me, and there is another dev.. but im the only one that is fullstack and able to basically do anything  and quickly pick up new things
[15:05:28] <robertmaxrees> that’s a problem.
[15:05:35] <nikio_> most devs cant rly do that
[15:05:40] <nikio_> awesome devs cost loads
[15:05:47] <robertmaxrees> :) I’m well aware
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> i help do hiring for my company.
[15:06:02] <robertmaxrees> we have to compete against LA/Bay Area salaries.
[15:06:09] <nikio_> yeh me too
[15:06:19] <nikio_> we are looking for someone now
[15:06:38] <nikio_> heard they are very high there
[15:06:47] <nikio_> i live in the Netherlands
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, bay area salaries are stupid because of the cost of living.
[15:09:19] <SpecialTech> one of the reasons i never accepted offers in bay area
[15:09:53] * SpecialTech waves at robertmaxrees
[15:09:57] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[15:11:29] <SpecialTech> I personally think if you know angular, you'll easily learn react.
[15:11:39] <SpecialTech> since react is View, while angular is MVC
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> *if you learn one framework, all the others get easier.
[15:11:44] <robertmaxrees> imo
[15:12:08] <nikio_> definitely
[15:27:11] <jak2000> hi all
[15:27:44] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[15:28:05] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ffcq0msv/1/    <---- row 6.... if the user click on - or + hide,, at this moment its OK, but if press button Reestablecer....i want show again the hide button ... how to?
[15:28:10] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!!!
[15:28:16] <jak2000> MErry XMAS!!! to all
[15:28:47] <robertmaxrees> which button is the hide button?
[15:29:20] <jak2000> <input type='radio' name='xIc_7' data-idtipo='1' data-id='N7' id='xIcN_6' autocomplete='off'> - </label>
[15:29:21] <jak2000> or
[15:29:59] <robertmaxrees> so first off, use better classnames heh
[15:31:00] <robertmaxrees> and also: don’t use .show() or .hide()
[15:31:00] <jak2000>       i try show again in this event: $(document).on("click", ".btnReestablecer", function() {
[15:31:04] <jak2000> but not do the effect :(
[15:31:50] <jak2000> then?
[15:31:59] <robertmaxrees> also: you’re hidint the labels.
[15:32:01] <robertmaxrees> not the radios.
[15:32:15] <robertmaxrees> $(this).parent().parent().find('.mychk1').hide(); hides the parent label element
[15:32:18] <jak2000> i need add bootstap to fiddle for see the real effect of the button
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> $("#xIcY_" + IdRenglon).show(); targets the input.
[15:32:32] <robertmaxrees> you need the parent label.
[15:33:08] <jak2000> done: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ffcq0msv/2/
[15:33:23] <robertmaxrees> erm/.
[15:33:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you don’t need to use chained .parent() calls.
[15:33:41] <jak2000> isnt good the solution?
[15:33:51] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() instead.
[15:34:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ffcq0msv/3/
[15:34:08] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[15:34:54] <jak2000> ok, checking...
[15:35:39] <jak2000> ooo easy more readable
[15:35:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:39:02] <jak2000> Here more Beautiful: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/xmmfwajw/ with bootstrap
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> coupla things.
[15:40:02] <robertmaxrees> those two handlers for mychk1 and mychk2 could be combined into one.
[15:40:21] <jak2000> wich line?
[15:40:28] <robertmaxrees> 1 - 7
[15:41:02] <jak2000> 1-6
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> 7
[15:41:18] <robertmaxrees> that second statement ends on 7 :)
[15:41:23] <jak2000> okjavascript sectoin right?
[15:41:26] <jak2000> *section
[15:41:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/3/
[15:43:42] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/xmmfwajw/2/   row 6, 2 buttons + and -  in black color right? you click on - button, and click on Reestableceer..... the button - is on blue color... how to draw black?
[15:43:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/4/ a bit better.
[15:45:15] <jak2000> ok, yes i see, https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/6/    here test the blue/black colour please
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> what do you think the issue is with the color?
[15:45:38] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[15:45:41] <jak2000> off / on
[15:45:43] <jak2000> u thing
[15:45:47] <robertmaxrees> bibi,.
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> *nono
[15:45:50] <jak2000> *i think
[15:45:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:45:57] <robertmaxrees> “off / on”?
[15:46:01] <jak2000> yes
[15:46:12] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[15:46:20] <jak2000> this:
[15:46:41] <jak2000> autocomplete='off'
[15:47:10] <jak2000> is my problem, when user click on a button is turned on ?
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the inspector to see what styles are on the element?
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> it’s pretty easy to see what the issue is.,
[15:49:02] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/PMYSyZF.png
[15:49:04] <jak2000> ok i am on inspector, go to elements
[15:49:11] <robertmaxrees> what’s the difference between those two labels?
[15:49:26] <jak2000> active?
[15:49:42] <jak2000> then ned remove these class... right?
[15:49:52] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn’t.
[15:50:02] <jak2000> *need
[15:50:03] <robertmaxrees> i’d change your css.
[15:50:26] <jak2000> style?
[15:50:28] <jak2000> ok
[15:50:36] <jak2000> checking again in inspector
[15:52:11] <jak2000> removed style and no effect
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:52:18] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried.
[15:52:22] <jak2000> ok
[15:52:42] <jak2000> run: https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/6/   click on first - next + next -
[15:53:14] <robertmaxrees> where’d you change the code?
[15:53:15] <jak2000> then click on Reestablecer Button (in each row)
[15:53:25] <jak2000> in inspector
[15:53:28] <robertmaxrees> ....
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> duder
[15:53:34] <robertmaxrees> gotta update the fidde.
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> i need to see what you tried.
[15:54:01] <jak2000> ok :)
[15:54:07] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/xmmfwajw/7/
[15:54:16] <jak2000> run
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> so what did you change??
[15:54:23] <jak2000> on 6th row
[15:54:35] <jak2000> click on - and then button reestablecer
[15:54:41] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[15:54:42] <jak2000> i se + black and - blue
[15:54:48] <robertmaxrees> i see the problem.
[15:54:54] <robertmaxrees> i need to see how you’ve tried to solve it.
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> this fiddle looks the same as the last one.
[15:55:14] <jak2000> <label class="btn btn-primary mychk1 plusOrMinus" style="display: block;">
[15:55:16] <jak2000> here in Elements
[15:55:22] <jak2000> i do 2 clicks on style
[15:55:27] <robertmaxrees> nono
[15:55:29] <jak2000> and remove: display: block;
[15:55:30] <robertmaxrees> change the css panel.
[15:55:37] <robertmaxrees> display: block; is not the issue.
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> it’s the “active” class.
[15:55:53] <robertmaxrees> go back to that screenshot i posted.
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> see how one has the “active” class?
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/PMYSyZF.png
[15:56:22] <jak2000> oo i see
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:56:28] <jak2000> add plusOrMinus class
[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the active class.
[15:56:41] <robertmaxrees> that’s what’s breaking your css.
[15:57:24] <robertmaxrees> the plusOrMinus class just simplifies things a lot for ytoiu.
[15:58:21] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> the issue is the active class.  <--- then remove the active class..
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> or restyle it.
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/8/
[15:58:53] <robertmaxrees> really simple stuff.
[16:00:18] <jak2000> ok, good
[16:00:21] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/xmmfwajw/6/   <---
[16:00:33] <jak2000> solved the problem :)
[16:00:34] <robertmaxrees> already linked that one duder.
[16:00:43] <robertmaxrees> nothing different in that one.
[16:00:43] <jak2000> duder?
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> aka “dude”
[16:00:53] <jak2000> jquery: wRenglon.find('.plusOrMinus').removeClass('active');
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> why can’t you just use CSS for that?
[16:01:25] <robertmaxrees> or do you want to kill it only when the user clicks reestablecer?
[16:02:17] <jak2000> only when user click on Reestablecer Button
[16:02:25] <robertmaxrees> (sigh)
[16:02:27] <robertmaxrees> lol okay.
[16:03:26] <jak2000> :)
[16:03:46] <jak2000> thanks
[16:03:56] <robertmaxrees> gotta be more specific in the future man
[16:07:09] <jak2000> ok, i try
[16:09:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees, wich plugin use for draw tables? edit sort, load json data from ajax call?
[16:09:20] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.
[16:09:30] <jak2000> of?
[16:09:34] <robertmaxrees> *on ;)
[16:09:52] <robertmaxrees> datatables is popular, but i’d hit up their forums for support.  not a lot of people around here know it terribly well.
[16:10:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do a google search,.
[16:15:40] <jak2000> yes i know datatables..
[16:16:07] <jak2000> is hard to implement but work fine... i implemented.... and for edit inline have a cost
[16:16:25] <jak2000> i think if not found other plugin more cheaper.... at middle of 2018 i buy
[16:16:27] <robertmaxrees> tons of alternatives out there.
[16:16:39] <robertmaxrees> and avoid paid plugins btw.
[16:53:26] <jak2000> i need plugin for edit inline, load json arrays(returned from server) and + (pagination, add styles...)
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> what do they need to look like?
[16:54:49] <robertmaxrees> tables?
[16:55:12] <jak2000> tables
[16:55:16] <jak2000> HTML tables
[16:55:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:55:24] <robertmaxrees> deja vu
[16:56:37] <jak2000> testing: http://www.editablegrid.net/en/
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=js+datatables+alternatives
[16:57:35] <jak2000> oo
[16:58:04] <nikio_> i dont see why you couldnt just use css and jquery to draw the tables
[16:58:12] <robertmaxrees> he wants a lot more than that.
[16:58:23] <robertmaxrees> sorting, inline editing, etc.
[16:58:58] <nikio_> i have stuff like that,made it meself
[16:59:00] <robertmaxrees> you can build that all out by hand pretty easily but not everybody has the time/patience/skill level.
[17:00:26] <nikio_> i  guess sometimes its worth to research a bit, you can reuse exisiting code, but often existing code is so bloaty, hard to customize that its not worth it
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> see prior statement ;)
[17:00:54] <jak2000> skill level
[17:00:56] <jak2000> important
[17:00:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:01:09] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 have you done any of the tutorials we’ve linked you?
[17:01:36] <jak2000> 2,3 but i am need a DOm tutorial....
[17:01:45] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[17:01:47] <robertmaxrees> try.jquery.com
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> you should really hit these.
[17:02:08] <jak2000> taplar explained a little... sample: jak imagine, <div></div> is a box.... under the box...
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:02:48] <jak2000> this night i learn more about
[17:03:05] <jak2000> nikio_ publish and share :)
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:29] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 duder
[17:03:32] <nikio_> belongs to the company x)
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> gotta start learning on your own.
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> your copy/paste process isn’t gonna be sustainable.
[17:04:51] <jak2000> :)
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:08:04] <jak2000> understand...
[17:08:23] <robertmaxrees> you’ve been asking the same kinds of questions for almost, what, 2 years now?
[17:08:53] <jak2000> not, 3-4
[17:09:00] <robertmaxrees> 3-4 years?
[17:09:02] <jak2000> but really i am learned... slowly but learned
[17:09:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:09:23] <jak2000> :)
[17:11:09] <nikio_> i was here three years ago
[17:11:46] <jak2000> nikio_: https://airtable.com/product
[17:11:49] <nikio_> and someone taught me some fundamentals about seperating view logic and data logic
[17:11:50] <jak2000> what do you think?
[17:12:08] <nikio_> and i still use the ideas he taught me to this days
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 lol don’t pay for a plugin
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ remember who that was?
[17:12:43] <nikio_> i remember you were also part of it : p
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:12:52] <nikio_> but there was one other dude
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> taplar?
[17:12:58] <nikio_> yah
[17:13:00] <nikio_>  : D
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  he still hangs out.
[17:13:10] <nikio_> damn, you have good memory
[17:13:21] <robertmaxrees> nah, it just sounds like something he’d do :)
[17:13:32] <nikio_> why?
[17:13:41] <robertmaxrees> that’s the kinda dude he is.
[17:14:15] <nikio_> do you think his teachings are valid?
[17:14:22] <robertmaxrees> I do
[17:14:27] <robertmaxrees> he’s a smart dude
[17:15:34] <nikio_> he also used backbone back then
[17:15:54] <robertmaxrees> i still use backbone today.
[17:18:34] <nikio_> the official react tutorial basically describes similar patterns that he taught me back then. and i still use today in my jquery code
[17:18:53] <robertmaxrees> a lot of those principles apply even just in normal js.
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> without any libraries.
[17:20:21] <nikio_> yup
[19:39:31] <jonez> greetings
[19:39:44] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[19:41:29] <jonez> is the proper way to query current css something like $("#timekeeper > .donemessage").css("color")? I ask because I always get "undefined"
[19:42:27] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[19:43:39] <robertmaxrees> also: are you sure  $("#timekeeper > .donemessage") is returning an element jonez
[19:44:07] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/w262nk71/1/
[19:48:24] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[19:51:21] <jonez> robertmaxrees, 'donemesage' returns an object, as expected
[19:51:28] <jonez> s/donemesage/donemessage/
[19:51:52] <robertmaxrees> right, but does it return any elements?
[19:52:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery selectors can return empty jquery objects.
[19:52:09] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($("#timekeeper > .donemessage").length);
[19:53:09] <jonez> $("#timekeeper > .countdown").length
[19:53:09] <jonez> 0
[19:53:25] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[19:53:30] <jonez> hmm
[19:53:32] <robertmaxrees> no elements match that selector.
[19:53:34] <robertmaxrees> kill the >
[19:53:36] <jonez> where did I go wrong?
[19:53:42] <robertmaxrees> try just $("#timekeeper .countdown")
[19:53:46] <jonez> when I do that, I still get 0 for length
[19:54:02] <robertmaxrees> then there's no .countdown as a child of #timekeeperr.
[19:54:17] <robertmaxrees> err, #timekeeper
[19:54:31] <robertmaxrees> what if you just do .countdown ?
[19:55:52] <jonez> turns out it should be #countdown
[19:56:02] <jonez> but my code is still broken
[19:56:10] <robertmaxrees> so it's $('#countdown')?
[19:56:17] <jonez> I'll try that
[19:56:34] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you shouldn't be doing $('#foo #bar') type selectors.
[19:56:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you aren't repeating that ID, right?
[19:59:15] <jonez> the #countdown does not repeat
[19:59:27] <robertmaxrees> does #timekeeper?
[19:59:29] <jonez> I changed the selector to $("#countdown") and same prob
[19:59:36] <jonez> no, that is unique too
[19:59:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see your markup at this point.
[20:00:04] <robertmaxrees> mind popping up a jsfiddle?
[20:00:37] <jonez> I'm not sure I can isolate the countdown such that will run outside my app
[20:00:57] <robertmaxrees> i just need to see the related markup and related js
[20:01:02] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't ruin.,
[20:01:05] <robertmaxrees> *run
[20:01:14] <jonez> ok ty for help. hold on
[20:04:23] <jonez> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/1s1sosqx/ that might be enough
[20:04:46] <jonez> the idea is that when the countdown expires, it should toggle the 'color' of the 'donemessage' a couple of times
[20:04:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[20:04:55] <jonez> ruh orh
[20:05:04] <robertmaxrees> how does your broken code factor into this?
[20:05:08] <jonez> do you need more js?
[20:05:14] <jonez> the startblink is what is broken
[20:05:15] <robertmaxrees> i just need to see the line that's failing.
[20:05:23] <jonez> it does not set color to anything, and it does not toggle
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> }); //"#timekeeper > .donemessage").css({"color": "red"});
[20:05:33] <robertmaxrees> this means nothing toi me.
[20:05:40] <jonez> it's commented out
[20:05:41] <robertmaxrees> uncomment it with the way you were using it.
[20:05:49] <jonez> ok hold
[20:06:16] <jonez> try now
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> and then how were yopu reading it back out?
[20:07:11] <jonez> at the moment, the console.log regarding donemessage.css shows 'undefined'
[20:07:18] <jonez> which explains why it does not toggle
[20:07:34] <jonez> the code expects 'black' or 'white' and w undefined, it does not behave
[20:08:01] <jonez> does line 5 look right?
[20:08:06] <robertmaxrees> donemessage is not an id.
[20:08:15] <jonez> oh my
[20:08:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1s1sosqx/3/
[20:08:22] <robertmaxrees> <div class="donemessage"> countdown expired </div>
[20:08:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:08:36] <jonez> I see it. hold on :0
[20:08:37] <jonez> :)
[20:09:36] <robertmaxrees> also ^ that last fiddle i posted is a prime example of how to make a test case for something like this.
[20:12:57] <jonez> robertmaxrees, got it working :0
[20:13:03] <robertmaxrees> rad
[20:13:15] <robertmaxrees> also: <div class="Time Seperator">:</div>
[20:13:22] <jonez> turns out my markup was more ".donemessage" and not "#timekeeper .donemessage" which caused problems
[20:13:38] <jonez> do I changed it to the latter
[20:14:20] <robertmaxrees> .donemessage wasn't a descendent of #timekeeper anyway.
[20:14:46] <jonez> do you have an idea about how to make #timekeeper stretch to fill the parent div, especially vertically? I'm using flex box already
[20:15:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're doing.
[20:15:29] <robertmaxrees> or is it more of a css question?
[20:15:32] <jonez> I can pm you a url if that is ok
[20:15:45] <robertmaxrees> is it a CSS question you're asking?
[20:15:55] <jonez> yes
[20:16:02] <robertmaxrees> hit up #css
[20:16:09] <jonez> ok
[20:16:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:16:18] <jonez> ty for your help
[20:16:23] <robertmaxrees> they'll be able to help you much faster.
[20:17:17] <jonez> assuming anyone is around...
[20:17:35] <cannap> ask in #web for that
[20:17:49] <robertmaxrees> if you have no luck there, feel free to ask here - but you'll need to toss out a link to the channel.  no PMs please :)
[20:17:57] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gkgkp5qq/ can the code from 71 to 83 become more clean,shorter etc....a filter is applied in both cases and the styling(css) is the same
[20:17:58] <cannap> show a example
[20:18:02] <robertmaxrees> this is where building test cases are awesome.
[20:18:18] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that's a big fiddle.
[20:18:52] <dimi1947> just focus in the lines I mentioned...
[20:18:55] <cannap> @jonez, send me the url i give a try
[20:19:03] <robertmaxrees> actuallyu.
[20:19:05] <jonez> cannap, ty
[20:19:14] <robertmaxrees> cannap people PMing links defeats the entire point of the channel.
[20:19:18] <robertmaxrees> but do what you want.
[20:19:27] <jonez> I have a http u/p on it
[20:19:30] <cannap> i know but its not my link xD
[20:19:34] <cannap> just send it here
[20:19:44] <jonez> ok
[20:19:56] <robertmaxrees> lol dimi1947
[20:20:24] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 for starters - don't define functions in click handlers.
[20:21:46] <cannap> @jonez but better move the problem to #web this is more general you can mix js/css/html i dont join css or html channel again
[20:21:59] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 either way.
[20:22:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd abstract out that other filter to a function and call that.
[20:22:21] <cannap>  i cant handle that ignorance in this channels
[20:22:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:22:51] <jonez> http://atlas.zoidtechnologies.com/timekeeper-countdown-0h3m0s
[20:23:09] <cannap> htaccess
[20:23:13] <jonez> yes
[20:23:16] <jonez> u: demo p: demo
[20:23:29] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:I am having difficulty following you...
[20:23:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gkgkp5qq/49/ dimi1947
[20:23:38] <robertmaxrees> look at those changes.
[20:23:48] <cannap> so what is the problem?
[20:24:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gkgkp5qq/50/ even better
[20:24:26] <jonez> the blink works
[20:24:29] <dimi1947> give me a second
[20:24:47] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 though I'm confused - why do you have var $radioGroups = $('.show_p_inpts'); but then you never use that var?
[20:24:48] <jonez> I need help w making the countdown scale to fit. also the #timekeeper should be as tall as possible.
[20:25:04] <jonez> it does the width properly
[20:25:12] <jonez> I'll fix the spacing of the elements later
[20:25:53] <jonez> this is not a jquery specific problem.. cannap could you help me out? :)
[20:26:06] <cannap> yes but switch to #web ok?
[20:26:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:26:10] <jonez> ok
[20:26:18] <robertmaxrees> you can keep talking here (shrug)
[20:26:22] <cannap> because robert helps a other person and then we talk cross
[20:26:22] <robertmaxrees> but do whatevs.
[20:26:29] <dimi1947> where is the code for the css?
[20:26:36] <dimi1947> I cant find it
[20:26:36] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 ....
[20:26:51] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 really?
[20:27:19] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/sdKbBGO.png
[20:27:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't see this?
[20:27:34] <dimi1947> found it
[20:27:39] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[20:27:42] <cannap> what
[20:27:54] <robertmaxrees> not talking to you cannap.
[20:28:22] <dimi1947> first things first...you are saying,not functions inside handlers,why?
[20:28:50] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you don't define functions in handlers because otherwise the engine has to re-evaluate the code every time the handler runs.,
[20:28:55] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason for that.
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> it's better code reuse.
[20:29:11] <dimi1947> got it
[20:30:07] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:I suppose this is the most clean the code can be done
[20:30:16] <robertmaxrees> without a major refactor.
[20:31:24] <dimi1947> we have two functions that do two separate things...can this be done with one function? just asking
[20:31:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:31:54] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to condense those onto one line?
[20:32:08] <robertmaxrees> or are you asking how to combine those two functions?
[20:32:38] <robertmaxrees> the issue is no matter what you'll still have those code paths.
[20:32:46] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to account for those regardless.
[20:32:57] <dimi1947> to make a combination of these two...IF possible
[20:33:11] <robertmaxrees> the way you have it now, it's at least clear what filter is operating against what selection.
[20:33:19] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, but I wouldn't do it.
[20:33:57] <dimi1947> it would become a mess...I suppose
[20:34:07] <robertmaxrees> indeed.
[20:34:16] <dimi1947> ok...thx
[20:34:27] <robertmaxrees> id really focus on getting that templating out of there.
[20:37:45] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:are you talking to me?
[20:45:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[20:45:37] <robertmaxrees> anyway, enjoy folks.
