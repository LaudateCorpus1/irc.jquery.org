[00:09:13] <lng> Hi! I need something like default call if on() is not executed, ".on('typeahead:selected typeahead:autocompleted', typeaheadHelper.pickSuggestion)". How can I add it?
[00:09:18] <lng> or maybe I can add another on?
[00:15:06] <pixolin> Hello. In some jQuery functions I see function(e){ … }. Could someone explain me, what that e stands for? would that be a variable name to be passed to the function?
[00:17:09] <pixolin> never mind. I found the right expressions to search for. answer is found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10323392/in-javascript-jquery-what-does-e-mean
[00:17:19] <root3d> pixolin, e is generic type
[00:17:52] <root3d> for event
[00:18:07] <pixolin> yes, just found it. Was too stupid to google obviously. sorry.
[00:35:06] <AdamPDotty> lng: I do not think you made yourself clear.
[00:51:49] <styk> hi : > I use chosen jQuery plugin to make select with search. Is any way to extend chosen plugin and override 2 methods and add 1 new?
[01:05:53] <neps> hi
[01:06:37] <neps> where can i find line by line explanation / description of jquery code
[01:07:19] <neps> links pls
[01:07:35] <neps> docs created by doc generator sucks
[01:07:43] <Uhkis> https://api.jquery.com
[01:08:05] <neps> uhkis : it tells how to use jquery
[01:08:19] <neps> but not what each line of code is doing
[01:08:28] <neps> correct me if i am wrong
[01:08:40] <Cork> neps: you won't find a line by line explanation
[01:08:49] <Cork> it would be too much work
[01:09:07] <Cork> and if you are familiar with js the code should be self explaining
[01:09:17] <Cork> most of the time at least
[01:09:38] <Cork> and the rest normally have a comment siting a bug or similar of why it does what it does
[01:10:11] <neps> why dont we build a system that does like wiki + git ( where wiki is colobrative code explanation well curated, and git is the code )
[01:10:21] <neps> i am thinking of to do it
[01:11:16] <Uhkis> have fun maintaining that
[01:11:41] <Cork> neps: the wiki would be out of date most of the time
[01:12:17] <Cork> neps: just open code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[01:12:31] <Cork> read through it and ask a question in here if you don't understand something
[01:12:45] <Cork> you should be able to get through a lot of it without help
[01:13:36] <neps> wiki content would be always associated with a piece of code, say function name, or variable name, if the variable is not there in the code, the system will not show any associated description of that piece
[01:14:13] <Cork> neps: your welcome to create the site if you like
[01:14:21] <Cork> but honestly i don't see the point of it
[01:15:21] <neps> cork: why ?
[01:15:35] <Cork> cause like i said, the code should be self explaining
[01:15:52] <Cork> and the few sections that isn't you normally have comments
[01:16:01] <Cork> and if there isn't a bug should be filed and the comment added
[01:16:07] <neps> yea, but its not easy for bigginers
[01:16:24] <Uhkis> that's what http://learn.jquery.com is for
[01:16:27] <neps> to understand the code
[01:16:56] <Cork> neps: if the code is hard to understand then it means you haven't learned the basics of js yet
[01:20:22] <neps> what i am trying to say is there is lots great code inside these kinds of libraries, but they are not accessible by biggner / intermediate developers
[01:20:53] <neps> so if we can have a website i think this knowledge treasure would be exposed to lots of developers
[01:21:27] <neps> if you happen to see paul irish recently gave a video on 10 things i learned from jquery
[01:21:57] <Cork> neps: i beginners should start with getting things working and getting a "feel good" experience
[01:22:06] <Cork> to boost the interest and joy of the task
[01:22:18] <Cork> and later dive into understanding the language
[01:22:23] <neps> so if we have a platform that to explain the code, we can explain the code
[01:22:23] <Cork> not random library
[01:22:38] <neps> library is just an example
[01:22:53] <neps> where we find great master piece of work
[01:22:54] <Cork> so pointing a beginner into the jquery code most likely will just create copy cats
[01:22:54] <phiz_> there are code examples on jquery's website
[01:23:01] <Cork> instead of getting them to actually learn to code
[01:23:22] <Uhkis> what code are you trying to document?
[01:24:06] <neps> what i am trying to document is to document the entire jquery library and other javascript library. we can do it collabratively
[01:24:22] <neps> can we
[01:24:23] <neps> ?
[01:24:35] <Uhkis> if you find people crazy enough
[01:24:38] <Cork> for a set time in history; sure
[01:25:00] <Cork> but remember most of the popular librarys change several times a day
[01:25:21] <Cork> take that * number of librarys you want to keep documented
[01:25:33] <Cork> and you would have to have a few full time workers to update the page
[01:28:29] <neps> only initially, later it would be like a wikipedia of code
[01:28:36] <neps> it will
[01:28:53] <Cork> no
[01:28:56] <Cork> cause like i said
[01:29:06] <Cork> librarys change several times a day
[01:29:21] <Cork> so you would have to redocument the library several times a days
[01:29:26] <neps> ll document only
[01:29:33] <neps> stable branch
[01:31:15] <Cork> well ya, have fun
[01:32:02] <Cork> i think you're going to have a bit of a hard time finding ppl wanting to plow there time down into this
[02:19:50] <kpap> Hiii :)
[02:21:00] <FriedZombie> hi
[02:22:20] <Jonsas> got some XML (like "<root><node>abc</node><node>def</node></root>") . how would I find a node by the value of the text inside it?
[02:23:36] <Jonsas> In regular JS the property name would be "textContent"
[02:23:40] <Jonsas> what is the equivalent in jquery?
[02:25:30] <Jonsas> var xml = $.parseXML("<root><node>abc</node><node>def</node></root>"); var valueOfTheFirstNode = $(xml).find("node")[0].textContent; //would return "abc"
[02:26:55] <Jonsas> but I would like to do something like : $(xml).find("[textContent=abc"])
[02:28:04] <Jonsas> IS there an equivalent attribute that contains that text?
[02:34:58] <Cork> Jonsas: .find('node').filter(function() { this.textContent == 'abc'; })
[02:35:10] <Cork> Jonsas: css isn't really meant to be used to search by text
[02:35:35] <Cork> attributes, tag names and so on is simple though
[02:36:22] <Jonsas> Cork: yeah. allthough I hope you meant to write js (not css) ... :)
[02:36:35] <Jonsas> Cork: thanks
[02:36:42] <Hausas> I get error in this line: $.base64.decode(base64_data); and the error is: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[02:36:42] <Cork> Jonsas: i meant css
[02:36:48] <Hausas> Why is this happening?
[02:36:58] <Cork> Jonsas: the strings you give to jquery is css selectors
[02:37:27] <Cork> Hausas: make sure base64_data is a string
[02:37:33] <Jonsas> ah
[02:37:45] <Hausas> it is
[02:37:51] <Hausas> hmm
[02:37:57] <Hausas> Lemme check
[02:38:08] <Hausas> I do this for 40 objects
[02:38:20] <Cork> well ya objects is the same problem
[02:38:44] <Hausas> but base64_data is a property in an object
[02:38:48] <Hausas> that's assigned earlier
[02:38:50] <Cork> anyway you send data to .decode that .decode isn't expecting
[02:39:12] <Hausas> I see
[02:39:14] <Cork> Hausas: have you actually console.log(base_64_data) ?
[02:39:18] <Hausas> it must be a string
[02:39:26] <Hausas> uhm
[02:39:28] <Cork> assuming it is isn't knowing
[02:39:29] <Hausas> I'll do that
[02:39:43] <Cork> *assuming it is, isn't knowing
[02:39:59] <Hausas> is it ok using $.base64.decode() ?
[02:40:07] <Hausas> or should I use atob()?
[02:40:21] <Cork> Hausas: check the plugin
[02:40:34] <Cork> (base64 isn't jquery native features)
[02:43:22] <Hausas> console.info crashe dmy chrome
[02:44:24] <Hausas> and after it unfreezes - it clears console
[02:44:25] <Hausas> wtf
[02:49:20] <Hausas> But I just used this for verification http://stackoverflow.com/a/7127007/2478905
[03:15:11] <wiherek> hi, i created a plugin
[03:15:24] <wiherek> in which I am appending html to THIS
[03:15:39] <wiherek> and then i attach a handler to a button inside of THIS
[03:16:03] <wiherek> but the elements which I reference from inside the handler are undefined :s
[03:16:11] <wiherek> even though they are accessible from the console
[03:16:21] <wiherek> or actually, the context is undefined
[03:16:45] <Cork> wiherek: are you sure the button is in the page when you try to select it?
[03:17:08] <wiherek> hm ok, I think i know what i am doing wrong now
[03:17:10] <Cork> if you do it async it might be that you do * add event listener, * add element
[03:17:19] <wiherek> no, I am using THIS in a wrong manner
[03:17:32] <Cork> wiherek: also you might want to look into delegated event listener
[03:17:35] <wiherek> yea
[03:17:45] <Cork> dynamically adding event handlers is often the wrong thing to do
[03:18:33] <wiherek> no, it works fine now
[03:18:36] <wiherek> :)
[03:18:49] <wiherek> what was wrong was I was using $(this) in the handler definition
[03:19:08] <wiherek> and $(this) probably was the button at that point
[03:19:25] <wiherek> and not the element which I was calling the plugin function on.
[03:19:54] <wiherek> so var that = $(this); and using THAT later on did the trick.
[03:23:14] <wiherek> by the way, I am building two plugins that should share some data
[03:23:24] <wiherek> I usually do this in AngularJS, not jQuery
[03:24:03] <wiherek> basically, I need to have two lists - the user should select items from one list and add them to the second list
[03:24:21] <wiherek> the second list is the other plugin and can be saved
[03:24:44] <wiherek> and it can be called independently of the first list / plugin
[03:24:59] <wiherek> at the moment I am attaching data to DOM objects with data()
[03:25:54] <wiherek> i wonder if that's the right approach.. I would rather have elements from both lists reference the same objects
[03:27:23] <Testybow> i am trying to get the next image src of a bootstap carousel and display that in a src img tag with class previmage and nextimage, the code is here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25314539/how-to-get-bootstrap-carousel-next-image-src
[03:27:29] <Testybow> can anyone help?
[03:28:47] <Testybow> so i can apply the diamond effect that are in this site http://tympanus.net/Development/ArrowNavigationStyles/
[03:29:27] <Testybow> that needs the next and previous image
[03:32:33] <wiherek> where are you getting the images from?
[03:33:32] <blueeclipse> morning all.  qq on jquery mobile- I currently have a site that is using jquery, and want to add some of the stuff from jquery mobile.  do I need to include both .js files?  I'm doing that and getting errors now
[03:33:50] <wiherek> is that the image? <img src="" alt="" class="img-responsive">
[03:34:00] <Testybow> in the same folder /images
[03:34:11] <wiherek> there is no src on the image though
[03:34:18] <Testybow> this answer your question?
[03:34:33] <Testybow> i removed that
[03:34:40] <wiherek> ok
[03:35:30] <Testybow> this will do anything ?  $(this).find('.active').next()
[03:36:27] <wiherek> kind of :)
[03:36:35] <wiherek> you want to use jQuery, right
[03:36:35] <wiherek> ?
[03:36:46] <Testybow> yes
[03:37:13] <blueeclipse> yes, I want to use jquery + jquery mobile together
[03:37:20] <blueeclipse> so the mobile build doesn't include regular jquery?
[03:37:21] <Testybow> i don´t know what to next
[03:37:58] <Testybow> maybe starting with this
[03:38:03] <Testybow> $('#slideshow-homepage').on('slid.bs.carousel', function () {   var nextslide = $(this).find('.active').next();    });
[03:40:31] <Testybow> and why this not work? $('.nextimage').attr('src',nextslide);
[03:51:04] <decx> nextslide is an element and src wants an url
[03:52:04] <Testybow> so, what i need to change?
[03:52:24] <decx> .... .next().prop('src')
[03:53:01] <decx> although from a glance that looks like a wrong approach with bs carousel
[03:53:18] <decx> but i'm not going to inquire further
[03:54:21] <wiherek> Testybow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25314539/how-to-get-bootstrap-carousel-next-image-src/25325226#25325226
[03:58:02] <wiherek> I updated it
[04:01:55] <wiherek> Testybow, I updated that again
[04:02:15] <wiherek> it works quite well now, as long as you have the arrows changing the active slide
[04:02:34] <wiherek> i wrapped the code in a function that executes onClick
[04:02:48] <wiherek> it has to execute AFTER you change the active slide
[04:03:01] <Testybow> wiherek i am watching if this works, thank you
[04:03:52] <wiherek> if the answer was helpful, please mark it as the chosen answer on stack overflow
[04:04:16] <obert> console.log() in chrome inspector tool what should returns, pleae?
[04:10:14] <Testybow> wiherek, the image appears but the correct image on hover is not showing the image that is right
[04:14:39] <wiherek> Testybow, you wanted the sources of prev/next images, based on .active class
[04:14:51] <wiherek> and you wanted to insert them into .previmage and .nextimage
[04:14:56] <wiherek> so that is done
[04:15:19] <wiherek> i did not add any logic for manipulating which image is currently active
[04:15:33] <wiherek> as that was out of the scope of the question
[04:16:06] <wiherek> if you need more help, create a new question on stack overflow
[04:16:12] <Testybow> is appearing another image that are in other carousel
[04:16:34] <t432> I can access a server var inside a jsp page like so "${foo}", how can I get a reference to this variable from jquery?
[04:16:53] <wiherek> put the active class on another slide, and it will update correctly
[04:17:39] <wiherek> just do that before getNextAndPrev() executes
[04:22:50] <Testybow> wiherek i think i need to restrict to that particular slide, referencing #slideshow-homepage ?
[04:23:47] <wiherek> why would you reference the parent element?
[04:26:52] <Testybow> so, it only executes and grabs the images in that slideshow? i am thinking correctly?
[04:34:41] <Jonsas> Is this normal? I'm using 'find' to get an array of nodes from an xml object. Then I'm looping through this array and removing some items. Surprisingly, this results in the corresponding nodes being deleted from the xml object, but the array remains totally unchanged!
[04:35:37] <Jonsas> is this normal behaviour due to the way reference objects are handled in js?
[04:36:08] <Jonsas> if not, I'll see if I can reproduce it in a code example and show you
[05:07:20] <wiherek> Testybow, yes
[05:11:15] <Testybow> wiherek, is working, i put a class where is .carousel-inner. when refreshing the left image not works because it don't knows what the last image is and when the slide moves the images are not correct
[05:14:05] <wiherek> as stated, you need to execute getPrevAndNext() after you change classes
[05:14:26] <wiherek> I added support for the edge scenarios (first and last elements of the carousel)
[05:14:53] <wiherek> you can check by manually changing the class active on the HTML elements in the plunkr.
[05:15:30] <wiherek> that code works correctly, but i can't assure for integration with the rest of your code; you need to execute it in the right order.
[05:16:04] <xenaxon> hi
[05:16:11] <xenaxon> I have a problem with jquery.
[05:16:37] <flam_> shoot it
[05:16:38] <xenaxon> my plugin works in pc browser but doesn't work on mobile browsers
[05:17:04] <xenaxon> any way of debugging on mobile?
[05:18:32] <xenaxon> the plugin only has an alert in it.
[05:18:58] <xenaxon> and I've written it according to jquery tutorial
[05:19:22] <xenaxon> could this be a file address issue?
[05:19:43] <xenaxon> because on my pc, I'm testing locally, and on my mobile... I'm testing through router
[05:20:07] <xenaxon> is there any way of seeing some sort of error log, or anything ?
[05:20:12] <xenaxon> in mobile browsers!?
[05:22:24] <xenaxon> Do I need to use jquery mobile, in order for jquery to work on mobile browsers?
[05:23:20] <xenaxon> flam_: ? any answer please?
[05:23:35] <flam_> i don't know
[05:23:50] <flam_> i'm not too much of a front-end guy myself
[05:24:06] <flam_> and only mobile development i've done is with java on android
[05:24:36] <flam_> well i quess jquery mobile would be nice to have for you:p
[05:26:23] <xenaxon> I don't get it. jquery mobile is a sort of visual framework?
[05:27:20] <ReBoRN`> I think you can use both
[05:29:02] <xenaxon> ReBoRN`: And I just load them both at the same time?
[05:29:22] <ReBoRN`> first jquery and then jquery mobile
[05:29:59] <ReBoRN`> jquery mobile needs jquery before
[05:30:15] <xenaxon> ok
[05:30:25] <xenaxon> never worked with jquery mobile. but worked allot with jquery
[05:30:47] <xenaxon> ReBoRN`: but I'm having this problem, my plugin is not being loaded in android chrome
[05:30:57] <xenaxon> ReBoRN`: and neither in opera or firefox for that mater
[05:31:14] <xenaxon> ReBoRN`: I just don't get it. it's the same plugin. only has an alert in it. What could be the problem?
[05:34:21] <flam_> show the code
[05:37:50] <thaifood> hi
[05:38:19] <xenaxon> flam_: http://jsfiddle.net/oarjkf6m/
[05:38:55] <xenaxon> it's just a simple plugin. I mean... it should work.. right? :D
[05:38:55] <thaifood> Is it possible to delay my alert?  I'm having no luck with this:  http://fpaste.org/125824/10629414/
[05:39:54] <xenaxon> flam_: as for the html... it just loads jquery (first) and then the plugin. it works on the PC browser
[05:40:11] <xenaxon> flam_: but it doesn't work on mobile browsers. It just doesn't load I think
[05:40:30] <flam_> you forgot one semicolon (it's a stylistic error)
[05:40:46] <flam_> and javascript doesn't have (x = <some value>) type of default parameters
[05:41:32] <flam_> just syntax errors, at least those i think
[05:42:42] <flam_> your plugin function's name is proto?
[05:42:58] <flam_> or are you trying to mess up with $.fn's prototype :o
[05:43:35] <flam_> have you written jquery plugins before?
[05:44:24] <Cork> flam_: leaving out ; isn't a syntactic error in js
[05:44:30] <Cork> as long as you have a line break instead
[05:45:19] <Cork> (breaking best practices; sure, error, nope)
[05:45:34] <flam_> i know
[05:45:39] <flam_> stylistic error
[05:45:45] <flam_> well "error"
[05:45:46] <flam_> almost:p
[05:46:01] <Cork> and a side node the default values is supported in es6 ^^
[05:47:50] <xenaxon> flam_: you were right. I forgot js dosn't have default values for params
[05:48:50] <Cork> xenaxon: arguments
[05:48:53] <Cork> params is urls
[05:49:01] <Cork> (and command line)
[05:50:27] <xenaxon> Cork: thks
[05:50:55] <xenaxon> Cork: as you say :))
[05:51:00] <xenaxon> Cork:arguments
[05:51:15] <xenaxon> flam_: thanks all. fixed the problem.
[05:55:45] <thaifood> Is it possible to delay my alert?  I'm having no luck with this:  http://fpaste.org/125824/10629414/

[06:02:51] <Cork> if you want the content of the element sure
[06:03:04] <t432> thats what i'm after.
[06:10:56] <johnnyJo> hello
[06:11:26] <kpap> doev: the compiler has some paths it will look by default, but the build is what specifies the default environment the compiler gets.  so it would be in the Makefile, etc

[07:37:45] <Mosselmaniac> hi guys
[07:38:50] <Mosselmaniac> how in the world do i select an element in html that is an array. the id is: #part[111] for example. i got that 111 dynamically. trying to set the checkbox value to true. doing it right now with: $("#part[" + c + "]").attr('checked','checked'); but doesn't seem to work. anyone?
[07:41:37] <b10110101> Mosselmaniac: maybe you would like that http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/ ?
[07:41:46] <Nomikos> silly easy question probably: foobar.fadeIn().delay(1000).slideUp().fadeOut(); -- this works but the fadeOut only starts after slideUp() is finished, how do I have them execute simultaneously after the delay()
[07:42:10] <Mosselmaniac> b10110101: i want something fairly simple
[07:42:54] <Mosselmaniac> b10110101: i have 10 elements with the same name / same id, but are identified as an array. part[1] to part[10]. i want for example part[8].attr('checked','checked');
[07:42:56] <b10110101> but i don't why we can create an id and use it
[07:43:26] <b10110101> aaaaaaa
[07:44:00] <b10110101> $('.elements')[0].attr('checked','checked'); ?
[07:44:33] <Mosselmaniac> thought so too.... ?
[07:45:06] <b10110101> i look
[07:45:09] <Nomikos> or, is there a way to run a lambda after delay() instead of defined jQuery methods?
[07:45:36] <Mosselmaniac> b10110101: can't get that to work...
[07:46:03] <b10110101> okay, me i create unique id
[07:46:11] <b10110101> myadmin_number
[07:46:20] <Mosselmaniac> b10110101: i don't think that id is included by me sorry ffs.
[07:50:27] <b10110101> Mosselmaniac: or you can use the parent
[07:50:30] <b10110101> and child()
[07:51:35] <Mosselmaniac> b10110101, never mind, got it. thx
[07:51:44] <Mosselmaniac> $("input[name='part[" + c + "]']").attr('checked','checked');
[07:52:28] <b10110101> and it's work ?
[07:52:48] <Mosselmaniac> yes thx
[07:52:51] <b10110101> so you are an unique id ..
[07:53:21] <b10110101> $('#id')... work
[08:05:32] <marc_v92> $(document).scrollTop() returns 0 in the console on my site, but works fine on other sites running jQuery. I can’t figure out why. http://volleyballmarathon.ca/
[08:08:12] <marc_v92> I should note that EVERY element returns a scrollTop() of 0.
[08:08:19] <ska-fan> How do I exclude from a set of elements those whose parent has class foo?
[08:08:31] <marc_v92> But I’m specifically trying to target the current scroll position so that I can put some triggers in.
[08:14:46] <ssssMd> hi can anyone help me a littl? i have a cdtimer that is stucksomehow
[08:18:47] <samhuntley> @marc_v92 remove the 100% height from the body and set a height in pixels on your first section
[08:19:32] <samhuntley> scrollTop doesn't play well with 100% heights, don't know why
[08:20:28] <kk1> hello
[08:21:21] <kk1> how do i inherit jquery plugin so that if i wish to extend i would add methods but for now just have all its functionality?
[08:21:45] <marc_v92> samhuntley: The #home section needs to cover the entire screen width, regardless of size. Unfortunately I can’t set a finite pixel value for it.
[08:22:02] <marc_v92> screen height, rather.
[08:28:10] <dmsuperman> kk1: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/ and http://api.jquery.com/jquery.fn.extend/
[08:28:15] <dmsuperman> depending where your plugin injects its behavior
[08:28:42] <jigal> how can it be thsi code runs twice? $('ul.pull-right').prev('div').append($('ul.pull-right'));
[08:30:32] <kk1> dsuperman i do not want to inject but add new methods
[08:31:01] <kk1> whats the syntax ?
[08:31:20] <kk1> $.fn.mockedform.prototype = $.extend(Object.create($.dform) ,{});
[08:31:45] <thaifood> How to test if a string will convert to an integer ?    "111b1" false "11111" true
[08:31:54] <kk1> dsuperman?
[08:41:01] <marc_v92> In case anyone is curious, the problem was that I had “overflow: auto” set on html, body.
[08:41:07] <marc_v92> Removed that, works beautifully.
[08:41:23] <jigal> how can it be that this code runs twice? $('ul.pull-right').prev('div').append($('ul.pull-right'));
[08:43:35] <robertmaxrees> because you call it twice?
[08:44:09] <jigal> robertmaxrees: nope
[08:44:13] <jigal> i only call it once
[08:44:43] <robertmaxrees> if you console.log() right before there, you only see it once?
[08:46:29] <jigal> robertbusy:  i am executing this only in the console
[08:56:25] <carczar> hello, If I am using an onclick attribute in an html tag, is there an easy way to get a reference to that element in javascript/jquery? further explination: http://codepad.org/3xuYKFMF
[08:57:44] <SpaceF_> possibly $(this)
[09:00:18] <dmsuperman> carczar: #1: using onclick attributes is bad practice, #2: you can fetch the originating element via the "event" argument which is the first thing that gets passed to your click event handler
[09:00:32] <dmsuperman> and yeah, #3 if you're using jquery, it will just be passed as "this"
[09:00:49] <carczar> ok thanks guys
[09:01:37] <SpaceF_> http://jsfiddle.net/8ajoL4gc/
[09:07:16] <decx> dont use alert
[09:10:07] <dmsuperman> you can't tell me what to do decx
[09:10:11] <dmsuperman> you're not my real dad
[09:10:22] <carczar> SpaceF_:  Thanks for making that
[09:10:48] <carczar> decx: I'm sure he is not advocating the use of alert, it was more of an illustrative debugging tool in this case
[09:10:54] <wunz> haha dmsuperman, that was funny
[09:13:47] <decx> i find nothing funny in the use of alert young man
[09:13:53] <decx> now go to your room
[09:15:04] <dmsuperman> I love alerts
[09:15:18] <dmsuperman> mostly because if I forget to open the console in time the error is sometimes just loss to the abyss
[09:15:37] <dmsuperman> certain things I want to debug and know for sure I'm getting the right value at the right time. it's also nice because it pauses execution
[09:42:00] <phoenixsun> hi have a rather broad question. Would anyone elect to create an Rdio clone with jQuery or is that choosing a hard road?

[12:10:25] <Siecje> In jquery-ui when you drag and drop, what is the last event after the drop event? 'stop'?
[12:11:59] <astrolapitatious> why is it so hard to get a simple text file from an external server using jquery

[12:20:49] <b010010110> inside remove:function(event,ui){ ?

[12:36:58] <ciqsteve> Q: $ajax - in .done()  (or .success),   I have access to the context via $(this).  It's an object that has a data parameter

[12:37:25] <ciqsteve> cant figure it out
[12:39:10] <Madsy> ciqsteve: What's unclear? Whatever you passed to "context" in the $.ajax() call is accessible as the 'this' member, as you said.
[12:41:00] <CapnKlutch> Does anyone know why we need Modernizr for foundation, and why it's not included
[12:41:17] <ciqsteve> data: "csrfmiddlewaretoken=q6tEjyqba6OqYHly0OJ95Ta7yyY7qlas&shortName=&text=No+need+for+indentation+here."

[12:44:59] <Kirito> Madsy, Yeah, the main thing is I want to add a crossfade animation with the changing background image
[12:47:01] <Kirito> Ahh, I think I can use CSS animations to work with this actually, I was just doing it wrong

[12:52:21] <axilla> afternoon all i'm working on a div inside of a modal that loses its ability to mouseover the second time the function gets called.. why is this only happening on this one div in the entire modal https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/e2e8a88948063335e045
[12:52:40] <axilla> the code above is my function.. if i load the modal, close it, and load it again the mouseover function quits working
[12:52:54] <axilla> its because it calls that function a second time and it just stops functioning.
[12:53:08] <axilla> i have verified this by creating a cookie to only load it once, but thats not a fix.
[12:53:56] <axilla> file_update_menu is actually a group of opacity: 0 input upload buttons that i'm trying to hide
[12:54:14] <axilla> inside of a menu so i want to make sure it stays visible when I mouseover the hidden div
[12:55:23] <axilla> its like the event is not ending when the modal is closed
[12:57:52] <axilla> zomg!
[12:57:55] <axilla> i think i got it!
[12:58:16] <axilla> woot

[15:38:41] <cheetah2> would someone please tell me why my code doesnt delete a html element? pastebin.com/8SkEB8EN
[15:39:17] <Woet> cheetah2: provide a working demo of the problem on www.jsfiddle.net
[15:40:11] <cheetah2> ok let me see that site
[15:40:17] <Json07> Woet: do u have any idea?
[15:54:40] <cheetah2> woet: here it is jsfiddle.net/Lcefumz2
[16:12:42] <b101100110> hello
[16:13:09] <b101100110> what's the best way for select an element who has created by jquery before ?
[16:20:41] <cheetah2> hello
[16:21:18] <cheetah2> im trying to .remove() a element echoed by php. it doesnt seem to work. dont know why
[16:22:23] <cheetah2> im doing $("#idnum").remove();
[16:22:56] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: That should work fine. Are you sure you're running it after the element is available?
[16:24:35] <cheetah2> BillCriswell: im runnin that is a function called in  .ready() im not sure if thats what you mean
[16:25:13] <cheetah2> in*
[16:25:23] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: Is there any errors in the console?
[16:25:40] <cheetah2> how can i see the console?
[16:26:28] <cheetah2> it doesnt output on the site and im running a alert() right before that shows the id
[16:27:01] <cheetah2> im running a .alert() that shows it got the id
[16:27:07] <cheetah2> on click
[16:27:47] <BillCriswell> Menu > Tools > Developer Tools in Chrome.
[16:28:21] <BillCriswell> Right click and inspect element could also get you there. Just click "console" to see if thee's errors.
[16:28:57] <cheetah2> it just shows getPreventDefault() is deprecated
[16:29:10] <cheetah2> some css stuff
[16:29:16] <BillCriswell> That's no big deal.
[16:29:40] <BillCriswell> Try console.log($('#idnum').length); and see if that returns 1.
[16:31:19] <DelphiWorld> hello
[16:31:23] <DelphiWorld> need a recomandation
[16:31:32] <cheetah2> log is not defined...
[16:31:33] <DelphiWorld> i want to indicate that the page is loading with a progress
[16:31:45] <DelphiWorld> when page load show  the page and hide progress
[16:31:58] <BillCriswell> console.log(), not just .log() ?
[16:32:04] <BillCriswell> not just log()
[16:33:02] <cheetah2> undefined
[16:34:22] <cheetah2> that means variable idnum in javascript is undefined right?
[16:34:59] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: It depends on the whole message.
[16:35:29] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: http://jsbin.com/vibusivaleya/1/edit?html,js,output here's what you're doing and it works.
[16:36:13] <Json07> hello im trying to use an autocomplete with php, but jquery cant receive the data from php, http://pastebin.com/HtnRGHsK i dont get why
[16:36:24] <Json07> do some 1 have an example
[16:36:38] <|RicharD|> Hi
[16:37:03] <cheetah2> why would it show in a alert(idnum) right before the right id?
[16:37:09] <|RicharD|> why if I do:twitterBox = $(intentEvent.target).parent() and then $(twitterBox).hasData('id')
[16:37:22] <|RicharD|> I get: TypeError: undefined is not a function ?
[16:38:12] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: You should probably just set up a demo at jsbin
[16:38:53] <BillCriswell> |RicharD|: That's not the way hasData works... it's also my first time ever seeing that.
[16:39:02] <cheetah2> its /Lcefumz2/
[16:39:27] <BillCriswell> What?
[16:39:59] <cheetah2> jsfiddle.net/Lcefumz2
[16:40:12] <cheetah2> its just a few lines
[16:40:20] <Json07> BillCriswell: |RicharD| cheetah2 do some 1 have an example?
[16:40:40] <BillCriswell> |RicharD|: Do you just want to check id there's an data-id associated with that element? Think you might just want twitterBox.data('id')
[16:41:27] <|RicharD|> thx!
[16:41:49] <BillCriswell> cheetah2: I think you want to do $('#' + P_Id);
[16:41:56] <Json07> an idea
[16:42:34] <BillCriswell> If you do "#P_Id" just will always look for exactly id="P_Id"
[16:42:37] <|RicharD|> was so simple...
[16:42:40] <|RicharD|> I'm fucking tired :D
[16:42:46] <BillCriswell> I hear that
[16:42:57] <|RicharD|> (I done 16hours of coding...really...no joking)
[16:42:58] <|RicharD|> :(
[16:43:03] <|RicharD|> I've*
[16:43:07] <DelphiWorld> lol
[16:43:20] <DelphiWorld> what's the best way to have a spash screen?
[16:45:10] <cheetah2> i changed it but cant get it to work
[16:46:54] <cheetah2> ohhh it works!!!!
[16:48:00] <cheetah2> are single and double quotes the same?
[16:48:07] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[16:53:06] <cheetah2> BillCriswell: thank you
[16:53:17] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[16:55:51] <Json07> im trying to use jquery-ui autocomplete, but jquery doesnt receive the data from php, does some 1 have any idea?
[16:56:10] <Json07> this is my code
[16:56:12] <Json07> http://pastebin.com/HtnRGHsK
[16:56:31] <cheetah2> are you using ajax?
[16:57:10] <Json07> yeah
[16:58:05] <cheetah2> ajax is the next thing i have to figure out for my site
[16:59:06] <Json07> do u have idea why jquery cant receive the data from the server?
[16:59:59] <BillCriswell> Json07: Look at the Network panel in dev tools and see if the request is happening?
[17:00:32] <cheetah2> u using chrome?
[17:01:46] <Json07> BillCriswell: i have nothing
[17:01:52] <Json07> cheetah2: im using ffx
[17:02:08] <BillCriswell> There should be a network panel in that as well.
[17:02:19] <cheetah2> should i skip httprequest object ajax or just skip to jquery
[17:03:33] <Json07> yeap, i went there but there isnt any request
[17:03:43] <cheetah2> i was actually doing inline event handlers but someone said use jquery instead
[17:04:50] <Json07> BillCriswell: i went to javascript and xhr on the net panel
[17:05:02] <Json07> there isnt any thing
[17:05:18] <BillCriswell> So you don't see the requests being made?
[17:07:15] <Json07> xhr there is 0 request, on javascript panel i have 7 request which is about the 7 scripts written
[17:09:41] <inglis1> anyone have a link to a decent div modal popup with accumulated errors from jquery validate from a full form?
[17:09:58] <inglis1> the issue with validate is that it triggers for each element, and I want to accumulate them into a single nice div popup
[17:12:20] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to extend/modify the plugin afaik
[17:12:43] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17306067/simple-jquery-validation-custom-position-error-message-placementf
[17:12:49] <robertmaxrees> err, take the f off the end.
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> specific, relevant answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17307180/923919
[17:17:15] <DelphiWorld> is there any language atribute to be added to a html5 app?
[17:21:13] <DelphiWorld> guys:
[17:21:18] <DelphiWorld> is there anything like that:
[17:21:28] <DelphiWorld> if (is a desktop browser): show this
[17:21:39] <DelphiWorld> if (is a mobile browser) show that
[17:29:08] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld media queries
[17:29:28] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i found modernizr
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> which which has nothing to do with your question :)
[17:30:08] <DelphiWorld> why? modernizr can detect feature
[17:30:13] <DelphiWorld> and execute code acording to it
[17:30:33] <robertmaxrees> right - your question was whether or not it was a mobile or desktop browser.
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> there are two different concepts.
[17:30:54] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i want the following simply
[17:31:10] <DelphiWorld> if the browser support mp3 (regardless desk or mobile)
[17:31:13] <DelphiWorld> then use html5
[17:31:16] <DelphiWorld> otherwise use flash
[17:31:29] <robertmaxrees> then modernizr is appropriate.
[17:31:34] <DelphiWorld> cool
[17:38:12] <meisth0th> hello
[17:38:44] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: is it pocible to show & hide a div?
[17:38:51] <meisth0th> i want to pass argument for complete function for 'fadeToggle' without duration and easing arguments, is it possible?
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld for what?
[17:44:34] <DelphiWorld> to be able to add a hidden div one for flash and other html, and show the needed one acording to modernizr result ?
[17:49:28] <kpap> cannap, attributes are not part of the DOM subtree.
[18:02:08] <kpap> hi
[21:15:02] <alphis> hey. i've bound an onclick handler to a button in a form. in it i do $(this).parent().submit() but its not working for some reason
[21:15:21] <alphis> i've verified that the selector is valid by alertint the action attr and its definitely the form

[21:37:32] <alphis> solved
[22:56:47] <drale2k> I have 3 separate divs and each div has 3 checkboxes
[22:57:00] <drale2k> what is a quick way to check if at least 1 checkbox in each div is selected?
[23:05:57] <rmill> drale2k: you could use `prop` or `is
