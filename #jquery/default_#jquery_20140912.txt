[00:05:44] <Kartagis> does jquery have something like new Date(date,'Y/m/d') ?
[00:06:02] <Kartagis> do we have*

[00:16:53] <Kartagis> AdamPDotty: can we format a Date?
[00:18:14] <P1RATEZ> Kartagis: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5250244/jquery-date-formatting
[00:20:01] <Kartagis> P1RATEZ: ya, I found that too, but I think I need a plugin
[00:20:48] <P1RATEZ> nah, use regular js http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3552461/how-to-format-javascript-date
[00:21:28] <Kartagis> P1RATEZ: the problem is, regular js can't pick up my fields for some reason

[01:17:50] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to acces to a object inside other object and print it on the html, but is very difficult for me. Any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/6/
[01:19:04] <Woet> what is the problem?
[01:19:18] <abailarri> Woet, do you say me?
[01:19:23] <Woet> yes.
[01:19:34] <abailarri> yes, do you se the var resp?
[01:19:46] <abailarri> is a object of objects
[01:19:47] <Woet> yes, I do.
[01:20:36] <abailarri> Woet, to see better the object: http://pastebin.com/dR9fj4L7
[01:20:45] <Woet> I can see the object
[01:21:06] <abailarri> I need to print in the html, the body and created at
[01:21:10] <abailarri> form each object
[01:21:29] <abailarri> like the example nickname in the html
[01:21:35] <abailarri> do you understand?
[01:21:41] <Woet> I do
[01:21:49] <Woet> so what have you tried and what is the problem you're running into?
[01:26:04] <abailarri> I tried to each inside the each but with no results
[01:26:31] <Woet> did you try using console.log to see what you're working with?
[01:26:43] <abailarri> The problem is that I don't know how to acces to a suboject propierties
[01:26:47] <abailarri> yes
[01:27:20] <Woet> well, you seem to be accessing nickname fine.
[01:27:36] <Woet> so what is the problem?
[01:27:44] <Woet> the jsfiddle you linked just does what it's designed to do
[01:27:46] <abailarri> yes yo user object I access well
[01:27:56] <abailarri> the problem is when I try to get message data
[01:28:01] <abailarri> the dates, the body, etc
[01:28:17] <Woet> please share the code you have where you are trying to access that
[01:28:22] <Woet> together with the console.log you're using to debug it.
[01:30:03] <abailarri> Woet, only I tried with this http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/7/
[01:30:13] <abailarri> I don't know what to do
[01:30:32] <Woet> you debug the structure and figure out what you have to do
[01:30:34] <NETim> morning. Loading content into a table from an AJAX post, everything works fine except for one td that has a <span> with a background image. The class is changed based on the AJAX, this changes the background image. The computed styles in Chrome show the background image but it doesn't display in the browser window. Thoughts?
[01:30:57] <Woet> try doing console.log inside your initial .each
[01:31:04] <Woet> at the same scope as you assign nicknames
[01:31:16] <Cork> NETim: are you changing the image with .css()?
[01:32:18] <abailarri> Woet, yes I do
[01:32:58] <NETim> Cork, Just changing the class on the image. I'm using a string replace, then using selector.append(stringreplacedhtml)
[01:33:32] <Cork> NETim: you mean .replace('old-class-name', 'new-class-name')?
[01:33:49] <NETim> template = template.replace('{{'+find+'}}', replace);
[01:33:57] <Cork> ok
[01:33:57] <NETim> find and replace are from an array.
[01:34:11] <Cork> do you have a demo of the problem?
[01:34:31] <NETim> not publicly available.
[01:34:44] <Cork> can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[01:34:53] <NETim> might take a while.
[01:34:58] <Cork> without a demo all i can say is "this should work"
[01:35:31] <Woet> abailarri: okay, you should be able to figure it out from the output.
[01:35:37] <NETim> thought so.
[01:35:54] <Kartagis> jQuery('$id').change(function() { ... } doesn't work?
[01:36:08] <Cork> $id <-- what is that suppose to be?
[01:36:18] <Kartagis> sorry, #id
[01:36:32] <Cork> and what element is that?
[01:36:55] <abailarri> Woet, when I do console.log in the first each: http://www.subeimagenes.com/img/captura-de-2014-09-12-10-34-07-1089362.png
[01:36:58] <Cork> also "doesn't work" for what?
[01:37:19] <Kartagis> decx suggested I use jQuery('#id').on('change',function() { ... }
[01:37:39] <Woet> abailarri: i recommend using a decent browser like chrome, which lets you traverse into them.
[01:37:39] <Cork> .change is the same thing as .on('change'
[01:37:57] <Cork> or rather .change is a shorthand for .on('change'
[01:50:09] <NETim> Cork, this is essentially what i have, but for some reason it works. http://jsfiddle.net/66smc21e/5/
[01:51:27] <Cork> NETim: ya, check with the inspector in the page to see if you can find an element that might cause the problem
[01:51:40] <Cork> as this works it isn't of much help
[01:51:48] <NETim> it's there in the inspector. Even sees the background image in CSS
[01:53:26] <abailarri> Woet, when I do console.log in the first level I obtain this, but I'm trying to do this: http://pastebin.com/8kZAR5Em
[01:53:45] <abailarri> I tried with other each inside the first each, but not get results
[01:54:14] <Woet> show your code with the second .each and console.log
[01:56:20] <abailarri> Woet, console.log for http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/7/ is http://pastebin.com/q2fH5JSm
[01:57:08] <abailarri> every two lines is supposed to be a different user
[01:58:06] <Woet> abailarri: again, i recommend using a decent browser like chrome, which lets you traverse into them.
[01:58:24] <abailarri> Woet, I'm using chrome
[01:58:33] <Woet> then why don't you see the messages?
[01:58:50] <Woet> http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/8/
[01:59:04] <Woet> shows the messages fine
[01:59:41] <abailarri> Woet, where you see the message?
[01:59:57] <Woet> abailarri: in the console.
[02:00:12] <Woet> http://i.imgur.com/If8bLtz.png
[02:00:38] <abailarri> yes, but I need to acces it and store to a var
[02:00:43] <abailarri> to print in the html
[02:00:48] <Woet> okay, so do it.
[02:00:57] <abailarri> how can I acces to the body propierty?
[02:01:07] <Woet> the same way as you accessed the nickname
[02:01:32] <Woet> it's fairly obvious.
[02:01:45] <abailarri> If I put subvalue.body I get undefined
[02:01:46] <Woet> use console.log, look at the structure, write code that matches it
[02:01:52] <Woet> yes, because it's not in the top level is it?
[02:01:56] <Woet> again, look at the console.log output
[02:02:45] <abailarri> I see that in one case in in 2 and other cases is in 0 or 1
[02:03:20] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/ksazynem/1/ <--- why doesn't this update total price field?
[02:03:41] <Woet> abailarri: which matches your resp variable.
[02:03:45] <bsah_7> I have this ajax-request.  {literal}{$url}{/literal} is smarty and will be replaced by valid url.
[02:04:09] <bsah_7> I have this problem: onsuccess, the footer_contact_form.hide() seems not to be fired
[02:04:24] <bsah_7> but if I add it to .done, it works like a charm.
[02:04:25] <bsah_7> why
[02:04:31] <NETim> Cork, I know. Odd. Thanks though. I'll come back in a bit when I've fixed it.
[02:04:58] <bsah_7> even console.log(data) will be displayd (out of success-Part)
[02:04:59] <abailarri> then if I put console.log(subvalue[0].body); I get one values, but with error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'body' of undefined
[02:05:25] <abailarri> This is because the values are stored in 0, 1 or 2 subobject
[02:05:40] <abailarri> then, I don't know how to acces, and is ths my initial question
[02:05:59] <Kartagis> got it
[02:06:04] <Woet> Kartagis: it does.
[02:06:13] <Woet> but you only check for opening kilometer change
[02:06:19] <Woet> so if you don't actually change that, it won't update.
[02:06:42] <Kartagis> hrm
[02:07:03] <Kartagis> I need a r.keyup as well, right?
[02:07:26] <Woet> abailarri: you have multiple elements, you want to display them all. use .each again
[02:07:58] <Woet> Kartagis: you probably want to do something like $("input").keyup
[02:08:05] <Woet> or give them all a class and check for that
[02:08:23] <Kartagis> wood
[02:08:26] <Kartagis> woot*
[02:08:38] <Woet> since they all matter
[02:08:44] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/ksazynem/2/ this worked
[02:08:59] <Woet> why not just check for any input to change?
[02:09:06] <Woet> and then update both fields
[02:09:11] <Kartagis> but I could easily replace with $(input)
[02:09:18] <Kartagis> let me check
[02:09:18] <Woet> with quotes around it, yes.
[02:11:25] <Kartagis> $('input'), right?
[02:23:57] <NETim> Cork, solved it. Seems that my replace was replacing an additional style I hadn't even noticed was being applied. Coffee first, then code.
[02:25:53] <tykayn> anyone has an experience with scroll issues on mobile devices ?
[02:26:24] <abailarri> Woet, http://pastebin.com/pL0XDBgJ
[02:26:35] <Woet> abailarri: okay?
[02:26:56] <abailarri> no, the Object {2014-09-12: Array[2], 2014-09-10: Object}  is the console.log(value) of the first each
[02:27:31] <abailarri> is onlye one row corresponding to a one user (in my case there are three rows, three users, but for the exampe only  I used one)
[02:27:33] <Woet> abailarri: i have told you what to do.
[02:27:47] <abailarri> Woet, but I can't do
[02:27:53] <Woet> why not?
[02:27:55] <abailarri> I tried some things
[02:28:32] <abailarri> how can I print the differents dates on a differents divs?
[02:29:02] <Woet> by using the first argument of .each
[02:29:07] <Woet> in the callback.
[02:29:40] <abailarri> Woet, see http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/9/
[02:30:01] <Woet> what do I have to see?
[02:30:35] <abailarri> what?
[02:31:10] <elmcrest> hi again... is it possible to have something in the sense of ($(this).find('input') == true) ?
[02:31:18] <Woet> abailarri: what do I have to see?
[02:32:02] <Nomikos> elmcrest: if you want to check if it's there, you can do $(this).find('input').length
[02:32:29] <elmcrest> Nomikos ok, so length greater zero evaluates to true?
[02:32:33] <Nomikos> yes
[02:32:38] <elmcrest> Nomikos ok, thx
[02:33:11] <Nomikos> elmcrest: integers below 0 also evaluate to true, funnily enough
[02:33:25] <elmcrest> Nomikos oh ok, good to know
[02:33:28] <Nomikos> keep this in mind for indexOf() :-)
[02:33:42] <elmcrest> :)
[02:34:04] <abailarri> Woet, this http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/10/ As you can see I'm trying to print each collection of dates (for each user), but It not prints well
[02:34:22] <Woet> define "not prints well"
[02:34:41] <Woet> everything you're printing shows up.
[02:36:32] <abailarri> Woet, http://pastebin.com/caVxwnHT
[02:37:16] <abailarri> I don't know why there repeated dates if in the var response there are only two dates per user
[02:37:16] <Woet> abailarri: i think you keep forgetting that you're the programmer
[02:37:30] <Woet> this channel is here to help you with problems, not to write code for you
[02:37:47] <Woet> if you do console.log on resp, you can see why
[02:38:34] <abailarri> I console logued a lot of times and I can't see anything. Is not programe for me, is orientate what can be the error
[02:38:42] <Woet> .chat is a class selector
[02:38:46] <Woet> you have multiple classes with "chat"
[02:38:51] <Woet> so it will be appended to all of them
[02:40:41] <abailarri> Woet,  only one .chat class per user
[02:40:51] <Woet> abailarri: so? your selector matches all of them.
[02:40:53] <abailarri> this is not the problem I think
[02:41:07] <abailarri> or yes
[02:41:10] <abailarri> wait
[02:41:39] <abailarri> I understand why
[02:42:16] <abailarri> you have reason
[02:45:20] <Nomikos> Woet: kickass animation on your homepage
[02:45:55] <Woet> well ty
[02:46:02] <Woet> seems youtube api changed something
[02:46:36] <Nomikos> the spelling of your nick looked dutch and I am too so I thought to check :p
[02:54:52] <abailarri> Woet, well I understand the is appending in chat class selector the dates everytime that each the objetc, then, what ways I have to prevent this?
[02:55:05] <Woet> use a more specific selector.
[02:56:20] <abailarri> Woet, the onlye way is to use a diferents selector every each?
[02:56:34] <Woet> abailarri: you will have to figure things out yourself.
[02:58:03] <Kartagis> $('#edit-subject') <*** why am I getting "undefined is not a function" here?

[03:00:58] <Woet> Kartagis: datepicker is part of jQuery UI. not jQuery.
[03:06:45] <dumb_dumb> guys how to make jquery datepicker always on the top of any html element
[03:26:06] <Kartagis> probably stupid question, but is it possible to use - in variable names instead of _ ?
[03:26:51] <Kartagis> unlike php
[03:31:20] <Cork> Kartagis: no
[03:31:39] <Cork> Kartagis: the standard is to use camelcase in js though
[03:34:02] <Nomikos> a little secret (probably best if it remained so) is you can use any character in a php variable name if you use complex notation eg ${'+x-fd86'}
[03:48:40] <abailarri> Anyone can help me please? I'm trying to add some html with a each function on a class selector but I appears reapeated. I don't know how to resolve this. http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/17/
[03:51:36] <Nomikos> abailarri: same issue as before: $('.moment').append(subkey).append('<br>'); <- you're appending to a class which appears multiple times on that page
[03:52:46] <Nomikos> abailarri: what you could do, is add some kind of unique id to the <li> you're appending for each user, and use that where you append the subkey values
[03:52:50] <Nomikos> in the selector
[03:54:40] <abailarri> Nomikos, I'm adding content to "moment" selector but I dont know how to add an unique selector this and add this same content
[03:54:54] <abailarri> I tried some lines for 6 or 7 times and nothing
[03:56:12] <Nomikos> abailarri: each user has a related id value, yes?
[03:56:52] <Nomikos> abailarri: use that value to add an id attribute to the <li.. element you're inserting on line 10
[03:56:52] <abailarri> yes
[03:58:49] <Nomikos> then you can use that id in the selector like  $('#'+ value.user.id  + ' .moment')  - except you're deleting the value.user, not sure why, but if that's required you can set the id to a temporary variable and use that instead
[04:03:04] <abailarri> Nomikos, I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/27/
[04:03:27] <abailarri> sorry
[04:03:28] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/39mw045w/28/
[04:04:22] <abailarri> works well
[04:04:22] <Kartagis> totalKm.val(parseInt(openingKm.val() || 0) + parseInt(closingKm.val() || 0)); <--- okay, I set a variable to this, can I do two things at once? set and show
[04:06:19] <Nomikos> abailarri: cool
[04:06:46] <Nomikos> it's not exactly what I suggested but if it works it works :)
[04:14:03] <hancock> How do you normally debug your code?
[04:14:17] <Woet> depends on what you're trying to debug?
[04:14:35] <Woet> "code" is pretty generic.
[04:15:38] <Nomikos> set breakpoints in the debugger in the browser's webinspector
[04:16:23] <Nomikos> check the variable values at those points etc. takes a bit to get used to the thing (and I should find a proper guide to it one day) but they're pretty darn useful
[04:23:47] <kakashiAL> hello guys
[04:23:59] <kakashiAL> I try to understand this piece of code here in detail:
[04:24:03] <kakashiAL> http://jsfiddle.net/q3m13rzw/1/
[04:24:58] <kakashiAL> the main line that I dont understand is this:
[04:25:02] <kakashiAL> $collectionHolder.data('index', $collectionHolder.find(':input').length);
[04:26:47] <hancock> I see
[04:27:11] <kakashiAL> hancock: could we go that line step by step?
[04:27:34] <hancock> I wasn't replying to you. I too am a noob
[04:27:44] <kakashiAL> hancock: okay :)
[04:27:47] <hancock> Started with jquery about 2 hours ago.
[04:28:09] <hancock> Looking at* coding 10min ago
[04:30:18] <kakashiAL> hancock: so you understand the reson for $ in variables and $() and the jQuery(document).ready(function(){} ?
[04:30:26] <kakashiAL> if not let me know
[04:31:04] <hancock> $ alias jquery from what I know
[04:31:34] <kakashiAL> yes, you can write jQuery(document) or $(document) its the same
[04:32:44] <kakashiAL> the main thing that you have to understand is that jquery wraps around tags or DOM objects and give thats elelemts more function to type less
[04:32:54] <hancock> How do I get the attribute in string format from a <img>. I tried this: "var currSrc = String($('img').prop("src"));" console.log(currSrc) -> undefined
[04:33:14] <kakashiAL> I dont know :(
[04:33:35] <hancock> ops. that worked. I just missed the # for id
[04:33:36] <hancock> :)
[04:34:14] <kakashiAL> it is also good practise and a clean way to use the $ prefix for your jquery stuff
[04:34:47] <kakashiAL> for example: $myVariable = $(TAG).someFunction();
[04:35:13] <kakashiAL> so if you see $ at your variable name, you know directly that it contains a jquery object
[04:35:14] <Nomikos> kakashiAL: as for $collectionHolder.data('index', $collectionHolder.find(':input').length); ,
[04:35:34] <kakashiAL> Nomikos: please step by step :)
[04:35:50] <Nomikos> .data() is a method that sets an attribute on an element, the arguments are the name and the value
[04:36:05] <kakashiAL> Nomikos: wait
[04:36:13] * Nomikos waits
[04:36:33] <kakashiAL> what do you mean with sets an attribut on an element, could you make a very simple example?
[04:37:01] <Nomikos> kakashiAL: sure. as you said, jquery wraps around elements/DOM objects/tags
[04:37:25] <Nomikos> here, $collectionHolder points at ul.tags, so that's the element
[04:38:15] <Nomikos> html elements have attributes like id, class, name, href.. the jQuery data() method gets and sets a specific type of attribute, the data-* attribute
[04:39:09] <Nomikos> it can look like <div id="foo" data-bar="12.95">. for this, to get the value you'd use $('#foo').data('bar')
[04:39:49] <Nomikos> to set a new value for it: $('#foo').data('bar', 10.95);
[04:40:13] <Nomikos> make sense so far?
[04:41:11] <Nomikos> in the jsfiddle, that line is setting a value for data-index, on element(s) <ul class="tags"> via the $collectionHolder variable
[04:42:04] <Nomikos> the value is $collectionHolder.find(':input').length , basically the number of form input elements (including select, textarea..) inside that ul.tags
[04:42:17] * kakashiAL is phoning
[04:42:25] <Nomikos> phew. I thought you'd fallen over :p
[04:56:00] <srikat> I am using websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/js/gf-field-focus.js to add a class to element of a form when fields get focus. It works when a checkbox or radio button’s label is clicked but not when clicking on the actual input element of radio and checkboxes. Any idea?
[04:56:07] <srikat> URL: http://websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/gravity-forms-field-focus-highlighting/
[04:58:45] <Nomikos> srikat: kinda hard to see without the actual lines of JS... if you could isolate the problem that'd help. But most likely the click handler just listens for clicks on the actual input tags, and <label> is not one of them
[04:59:58] <srikat> http://pastebin.com/Yae4KQpt
[05:03:03] <Nomikos> I had no idea you could add classes to event names like focus.sridhar
[05:03:21] <Nomikos> .sridhar is a class that sits on those input elements?
[05:03:27] <srikat> ‘sridhar’ is namespace
[05:03:36] <srikat> can be anything or not be present at all
[05:03:59] <srikat> “focused” is the class that I am injecting when form fields gets focus
[05:04:04] <Nomikos> right
[05:04:36] <calamity> hey all. I'm writing a little function that needs to get the value in a text box, then the text from the span next to it.
[05:04:54] <srikat> The issue is that focus event doesn’t seem to work when the actual checkboxes or radio buttons are clicked…. it’s working on labels of these fields.
[05:05:02] <Nomikos> srikat: and the elements that the handler should "listen for" are .gform_wrapper :input, so any input element inside gform_wrapper class
[05:05:20] <srikat> correct.
[05:05:22] <Nomikos> gah. now I see
[05:06:06] <bsah_7> The Contact-Form at the lower right is an ajax-form. http://trainer.bsah-gmbh.de/     … works well in chrome, but not in firefox. Any suggestion why?
[05:06:06] <Nomikos> ok, slightly tricky, the click event doesn't seem to trigger focus
[05:06:11] <srikat> Here’s a site where it works fine: http://www.morriselections.org/pollworkers/apply.asp, and here’s my test site with the form: http://websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/gravity-forms-field-focus-highlighting/
[05:06:34] <Nomikos> but if you simply add click it'll toggle the class off if you click a second time
[05:06:42] <srikat> yes, that is the problem.
[05:07:38] <srikat> can’t simply add click event. The entire .gfield (parent of the field clicked), should remain in focus when any part of the checkboxes or radio group is clicked/focused.
[05:08:00] <Nomikos> that's the thing with toggle.. personally I'd set separate eventhandlers for blur and focus (with addClass and removeClass), and add one for click that simply adds the class
[05:08:16] <Nomikos> slightly more lines of code, but simpler IMHO
[05:08:53] <krambiorix> hi, i have a page like <div class="wrapper"><div class="header></div><div class="content" id="c_1"></div><div class="header></div><div class="content" id="c_2"></div> ---> I want to delete #c_1 but also the .header before #c_1 ... How can i do that?
[05:08:55] <srikat> that is how i started :) See the commented code at http://websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/js/gf-field-focus.js
[05:09:08] <Nomikos> you can still use the parents('.gfield') part though
[05:09:47] <Nomikos> yeah like that, did that code work ok?
[05:09:51] <calamity> http://mysticpaste.com/private/qRgjPtJ4ys?2 -- this is the relevant code. it's not throwing any errors, but it's also not changing the text, and if I echo out the values I get blanks
[05:09:58] <CorySimmons> Hi guys. Say I have an attribute that looks like this: <div col-740="1/3"> where the 740 is a dynamic number. How could I select that with an $.each?
[05:10:51] <srikat> yes, although I did not add the click event that adds the class. I would have to ensure that class is removed when another control gets focus.
[05:10:54] <srikat> I’ll try.
[05:11:37] <Nomikos> ah, yes. but then, you could also set focus explicitly in the click event handler, that way clicking elsewhere it will receive a blur trigger
[05:11:52] <Nomikos> my terminology may be off but I hope you catch my drift :p
[05:13:38] <bsah_7> got it
[06:30:00] <brollypop> hey could someone help, im trying to filter my results by using ajax
[06:30:08] <brollypop> so im sending some criteria like category and city to my controller like this
[06:30:18] <brollypop> https://gist.github.com/lukaszdacyl/9d5de7447fe1b0938c07
[06:30:28] <brollypop> but i dont receive anything, my var_dump($data) gives back null
[06:31:29] <brollypop> if i use console.log(opts) in js part it returns ["catDouble", "rey"]
[06:31:32] <BillCriswell> brollypop: You would need to use $_POST['filterOpts'] to get ot that in PHP.
[06:32:34] <BillCriswell> brollypop: Ah, didn't scroll down. You probably want $request->query->post('filterOpts');?
[06:32:37] <BillCriswell> total guess though.
[06:33:10] <BillCriswell> Er, basically, if there's any different between get and post in whatever you're using switch get with post haha.
[06:41:46] <jphase> g'mernin' :)
[06:43:38] <jphase> BillCriswell, Velveeta, whoever - have any idea what could be causing http://afkt.dev.moguldom.com/login/?action=register to jump down the page? It's clearly related to the recent addition of reCAPTCHA so I'm thinking it's either a JS event for after it's rendered, but curious to hear anyone's thoughts
[06:44:26] <Velveeta> <clickety-clicking now>
[06:44:27] <jphase> also seems to happen on the page that asks for 2FA on here so I'm thinking there's some sorta post-js-rendered type of thing that's jumping down the page, just trying to figure out how to troubleshoot :\
[06:44:29] <BillCriswell> What's jumping down the page? Also, there's an error in your Javascript.
[06:45:01] <jphase> yeah, that's always there on the dev site - there used to be 14, and now we have 1 so I'm ignoring that for now hehe
[06:45:18] <jphase> when you first hit the page it jumps down near the CAPTCHA field, for me anyhow
[06:45:33] <BillCriswell> Can't reproduce that.
[06:45:40] <jphase> oh okay, which browser are you in?
[06:45:43] <BillCriswell> Oh there it goes finally.
[06:45:59] <BillCriswell> I'm at a conference so the wifi may be patchy.
[06:46:13] <jphase> ooo, exciting
[06:46:17] <Velveeta> mine isn't jumping in chrome
[06:46:25] <Velveeta> and yeah, what conference, and who authorized this?
[06:46:36] <BillCriswell> Drupaldelphia.
[06:46:52] <BillCriswell> Can't say I'm a big Drupal fan by any means but it's good for work.
[06:47:15] <jphase> hey, conferences that are paid for by work are good on most topics :D
[06:47:39] <Velveeta> is it seriously called drupaldelphia?
[06:47:48] <Velveeta> because if so, that marketing person needs to be fired
[06:47:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yes.
[06:48:02] <jphase> Velveeta: odd, I'm in chrome on mac atm - refreshing the page maintains my scroll position but hitting "enter" in the URL bar definitely jumps down to the captcha field :(
[06:48:06] <BillCriswell> http://drupaldelphia.com/
[06:48:19] <BillCriswell> jphase: It seems like the autofocus might be messing with it.
[06:48:22] <Velveeta> jphase: i'm on chrome/mac also, let me try the url thing
[06:48:41] <Velveeta> ok, that did it
[06:48:58] <jphase> BillCriswell: by autofocus are you referring to something from reCAPTCHA's js events I assume?
[06:49:34] <BillCriswell> jphase: I was being autofocused on the first field. So I assumed the browser was jumping to that then I guess whever you wanted it to.
[06:49:54] * jphase reads their docs to see if there's something he's missing
[06:50:10] <jphase> I do know that the tab indices are all fuckered so that could be it too
[06:50:12] <jphase> hmm
[06:50:54] <prohobo> hey can someone tell me why ajax calls sometimes get called multiple times?
[06:50:56] <jphase> is autofocusing on the first input (via tab index) something the browser does or?
[06:51:06] <srikat> Trying to add background for form fields on focus. For checkboxes & radio buttons, works when labels are clicked but not when the actual input elements of these controls are clicked. Form: http://websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/gravity-forms-field-focus-highlighting/, JS: http://websitesetuppro.com/demos/devsite/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/js/gf-field-focus.js
[06:51:09] <jphase> prohobo: the event that fires them is happening multiple times
[06:51:27] <prohobo> i can click a button, have the ajax call fire once, refresh the page, click button it might fire once, it might fire twice, it might fire three times
[06:53:03] <jphase> prohobo: yeah it's probably either binding multiple click events, or the events are propagating (i.e. when you bind an event to a parent element and you click the child and it's firing twice), or your mouse is trigger happy :)
[06:53:23] <prohobo> might be propagation
[06:53:25] <jphase> most likely option 1 or 2
[06:54:41] <prohobo> i disabled propagation
[06:54:44] <prohobo> WHAT THE HELL MAN
[06:54:45] <prohobo> jesus
[06:54:46] <Velveeta> prohobo: try putting a console.trace() into the function that makes your ajax call, and check the stack trace when it happens multiple times, to see where the extra calls are coming from
[06:54:57] <prohobo> disabling propagation fixed the issue
[06:55:02] <prohobo> ive been debugging this for hours
[06:55:06] <jphase> oooo, I always forget about that gem!
[06:55:25] <prohobo> oh cool velveeta
[06:55:56] <Velveeta> jphase: i can't seem to find anything immediately obvious in your code that's causing this issue
[06:56:08] <Velveeta> and unfortunately, i have a meeting in an hour and a half that i still have to wrap up some code for
[06:56:20] <jphase> okay, that's good enough for me Velveeta - I just needed validation from another nerd more than anything hehe
[06:56:25] <jphase> I can troubleshoot from here, thx bud
[06:57:21] <Velveeta> and srikat: your form page seems to work as expected in my browser...
[06:57:56] <srikat> Velveeta: Can you scroll down the page click on any of the round radio buttons?
[06:58:02] <prohobo> why the hell does propagation exist
[06:58:03] <srikat> not the label, the radio button itself.
[06:58:28] <prohobo> seriously? i get that you might want to share event feeling to parents
[06:58:40] <prohobo> but why call the same handler for each parent
[06:58:56] <prohobo> that's just... so god damn stupid
[06:59:42] <Velveeta> prohobo: propagation exists for the purposes of event bubbling, which is a very important concept for building scalable event-driven sites
[06:59:57] <prohobo> yes i understand
[07:00:04] <Velveeta> srikat: right, i tried on a checkbox label, checkbox itself, radio button label, and radio button itself, and they all worked the same for me
[07:00:24] <prohobo> somehow languages like Flash manage to bubble events without calling the handler multiple times on a one-off event
[07:00:45] <Velveeta> event propagation only calls the handler once per element per binding
[07:01:03] <srikat> Velveeta: May I ask which browser?
[07:01:04] <Velveeta> if stopping event propagation solved your problem, then it would seem you had that handler bound up to multiple parents also
[07:01:09] <Velveeta> srikat: mac chrome
[07:01:21] <Velveeta> i'll double check that form real quick though, just to make sure i wasn't smoking crack at the time
[07:01:26] <prohobo> $('#migrate-btn').click(function(e)
[07:01:39] <prohobo> the only element on the entire website called migrate-btn
[07:01:59] <Velveeta> yep, elements and labels both trigger the container element to turn blue for me
[07:01:59] <srikat> aaaa, so it’s Firefox that’s causing the problem, working fine in Chrome.
[07:02:11] <srikat> wonder why..
[07:02:24] <Velveeta> prohobo: then something may be triggering your click event multiple times, but i can guarantee it isn't event bubbling
[07:02:54] <Velveeta> this is where some deep debug techniques come in handle to check the jquery dispatch function and see what triggered your event, and what the target element was, etc, per firing
[07:04:05] <MacroMan> How would I go about using the jQueryUI tooltip function with .on() ?
[07:04:55] <prohobo> velveeta i disabled propagation and the problem disappeared
[07:05:31] <Velveeta> yeah, and i don't know what to say about that, because what that does specifically is stop the event bubbling, which only means that the event won't migrate to its parent elements to be triggered there
[07:05:44] <prohobo> yep
[07:05:48] <Velveeta> i'd have to get elbows deep in that code to figure out the reason it was firing multiple times
[07:05:52] <prohobo> but why the hell would it even trigger there
[07:06:08] <prohobo> its a single element event handler
[07:07:10] <Velveeta> i don't have an answer for that without being able to examine the code
[07:07:20] <prohobo> i know, im just annoyed by it
[07:07:36] <prohobo> it obviously has a reason for doing that
[07:07:45] <Velveeta> right
[07:07:50] <prohobo> but wow i hate js
[07:08:48] <Velveeta> i love it
[07:08:56] <Velveeta> but i've come to know it......... intimately..
[07:09:01] <Velveeta> ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
[07:11:07] <rockyrock> hi guys
[07:11:14] <salemh> hi!
[07:13:05] <_hancock> Hey, I am having an issue with slideToggle not having a very smooth animation
[07:14:06] <rockyrock> I’m trying to send an ajax request to submit a form. When I send it via a REST test extension it works, but when I send it via jquery it fails. Here is my code: http://pastie.org/private/uti2hwtoiifglmpbz3hf5a
[07:14:44] <rockyrock> jquery retuns just as an error message: error 0
[07:15:31] <_hancock> This is my code, the css is probably not important: https://bpaste.net/show/8c3a6c9e4a8d
[07:15:34] <Velveeta> rockyrock: have you examined that the data is being encoded properly, and that the appropriate headers are the same in both cases?
[07:16:54] <_hancock> Here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/yhusuawu/
[07:17:06] <_hancock> The flexbox seems to distort the animation
[07:17:22] <rockyrock> Velveeta: here is the preview I get from the rest test extension: http://pastie.org/private/v5s3ocanzmzyi5bpnbnjq
[07:24:22] <Velveeta> rockyrock: so have you checked it against what's being transmitted by your ajax submission?
[07:24:49] <rockyrock> Velveeta: I’m new to ajax so I don’t know what to check and how
[07:25:30] <Velveeta> are you using chrome?
[07:27:43] <rockyrock> Velveeta: yes
[07:27:49] <jphase> Velveeta: I figured out that whoever was responsible for this page prior to me farted out some multiple <body> tags - which explains the weird behavior. Just wanted to report back :(
[07:27:57] <rockyrock> Velveeta: i put this as a question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25810559/sending-ajax-request-with-a-rest-works-but-not-with-jquery
[07:28:31] <Velveeta> jphase: gross
[07:29:05] <Velveeta> rockyrock: you can check your network tab in chrome's devtools, and when you see it kick off the ajax request to the server, you can click on that line item and inspect the request itself, to see what format is being sent to the server
[07:41:43] <banisterfiend> is this valid HTML5 ? ""<p> This is a paragraph <p""   cos when i pass it through $.parseHTML() it seems to accept it, returning: <p> This is a paragraph </p>
[07:43:50] <decx> i dont know about <p but in html5 closing tags are optional
[07:44:42] <banisterfiend> decx i just need a strict html5 parser, that rejects stuff that isn't comformant, do you think i can rely on $.parseHTML ?
[07:45:03] <decx> i have no idea
[07:55:25] <caraconan> Hi there. Playing around with JQuery Mobile (JQM) and Phonegap. My problem is that the pageinit() event is just triggered the first time that I enter the page. Relevant part of the code here: http://paste.debian.net/120541/. Any help will be welcomed. Thanks
[07:58:23] <rockyrock> can someone at least tell me if I’m putting the URL correctly? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25810559/sending-ajax-request-with-a-rest-works-but-not-with-jquery
[07:58:29] <rockyrock> is my URL in correct format?
[08:01:46] <Velveeta> rockyrock: yes...... have you tried verifying the format of the data that's being sent to the server like i asked earlier?
[08:02:03] <NoiseEee> rockyrock: sure, but as mentioned - your ajax request needs to obey Same Origin Policy
[08:02:16] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy @ rockyrock
[08:04:14] <rockyrock> if only I can see the raw request format sent from my browser :(
[08:04:27] <rockyrock> then I can compare it to the raw request sent from the REST extension
[08:10:04] <rockyrock> Velveeta: is there a way to get a more informative error message?!!!!
[08:10:21] <rockyrock> because what I’m getting is just ‘0’! I’m really going crazy
[08:10:36] <rockyrock> i’m trying to dispaly the error from: xhr.status + " " + xhr.responseText
[08:13:26] <Velveeta> rockyrock: i've already told you how to look at the raw request format sent from your browser, you still haven't confirmed that you've looked at it... there's also the same origin policy that's been mentioned on your SO question and by noiseeee
[08:13:46] <Velveeta> the only way to get a more informative error message is if you own that server and program it to return a more informative error message
[08:19:31] <Prometheian> Perhaps someone could point me in the right direction for this. The latest version of chrome (37.0.2062.120)'s V8 engine (3.27.34.17) appears to have an issue loading the scripts for my companies website in the correct order, resulting in strange issue around the site. Does anyone know/can point me in the right direction to tell chrome to use an older V8 engine or something?
[08:19:33] <rockyrock> Velveeta: I looked and looks lije json
[08:19:37] <rockyrock> *like
[08:20:43] <rockyrock> Velveeta: no I’m sorry I can’t see the data from Chrome I can’t find out how
[08:20:51] <rockyrock> I opened Developer Tools and then Network
[08:20:56] <Velveeta> prometheian: as far as i know, there's nothing like compatibility mode in chrome... when you say it's loading your scripts in the wrong order, are they being loaded as script tags in the document, and it's ignoring the order they're written in? or is it being loaded with something like requirejs, and you're having race conditions?
[08:20:58] <rockyrock> then I submitted my form
[08:21:03] <NoiseEee> rockyrock: and are you obeying same origin policy/
[08:21:18] <rockyrock> then I saw a red call appeared
[08:21:31] <rockyrock> but when I investaigaged it I couldn’t see the data
[08:22:56] <Prometheian> Velveeta: It appears to be loading some scripts, then page elements, then more scripts then the rest of the page. Not using require js, and never had issues before this version of the V8 engine.
[08:23:22] <Velveeta> are all of your tags in the head?
[08:23:43] <Prometheian> I believe because it's pulling from a master page with some scripts on it, it might be loading the page and scripts first, then the master page+scripts second.
[08:24:01] <Prometheian> This is a bit of an older site using winforms, so no head/body area defined. :/
[08:24:14] <Prometheian> Well, rendered it's there but I don't tell it where to go in the code.
[08:42:29] <somerandomguy_> hey guys, I'm using .change() to trigger an event when a person switches a <select> dropdown. however.. it does not fire when a script changes it. is there another event that I can use?
[08:43:35] <tandroid> somerandomguy_: Why not create a callback function on the script that changes it?
[08:43:42] <tandroid> or do you not have that control?
[08:44:15] <somerandomguy_> tandroid: just thought of that, let me try, thanks
[08:52:36] <Apple314> Hello all. I have build arduino robot, now i have it interfacet to raspbery pi that has a webserver and webcamera. I have movement and sensor readings done. What I need is a way to use motion to stream video to div. Any help would be appriciated.
[08:57:33] <somerandomguy_> tandroid: thank you, that worked
[08:57:36] <coxaLT> wich is jqueryui irc channel
[08:57:38] <coxaLT> hello
[08:57:48] <tandroid> somerandomguy_: Great!
[08:58:17] <droid909> how do i get everything from my url but domain
[08:58:18] <droid909> ?
[08:58:29] <JenniferB2> Hi folks! I inserting html and a script tag included into the dom, and it seems as if jQuery somehow seems to run the script code through its method globalEval ...
[08:58:35] <droid909> i.e. currend url is example.com/one/two?three
[08:58:47] <droid909> i need /one/two?three
[08:59:47] <JenniferB2> is this neccessary? How can jQuery hijack this?
[08:59:55] <coxaLT> I would like to ask, would there be a project for description of, for example.: displaying random member pictures on website header
[09:00:02] <coxaLT>  Like, there is header, full with, height ~300px
[09:00:06] <coxaLT> And there is displaying multiple random, or pre-set member pictures with click'able links or something like that
[09:01:36] <tcideneboeN> hi
[09:01:56] <Neobenedict> this.$txtArea.bind("something goes here",$.proxy(this.traceTextareaEvent,this));
[09:02:13] <Neobenedict> what do I need to bind as for it to call when that textarea is modified
[09:02:18] <Neobenedict> by jquery
[09:05:34] <tandroid> Neobenedict: You'll probably have to check for keypress on focus of that textarea
[09:05:50] <Neobenedict> no
[09:05:52] <Neobenedict> its a hidden textarea
[09:06:00] <Neobenedict> this is some jquery bbcode library
[09:06:07] <Neobenedict> and another script inserts into the hidden textarea
[09:06:20] <Neobenedict> and the bind to update across from the hidden textarea isn't working
[09:06:20] <tandroid> Oh I see
[09:06:31] <Neobenedict> well
[09:06:32] <Neobenedict> $(document).bind("mousedown",$.proxy(this.traceTextareaEvent,this));
[09:06:43] <Neobenedict> atm it needsm ousedown so if people are typing and don't click then whatever it is doesn't appear
[09:10:37] <Neobenedict> any help?
[09:13:40] <tandroid> Neobenedict: What triggers the other script to fill in the hidden text area?
[09:13:51] <Neobenedict> another jquery thing
[09:13:54] <Neobenedict> it uh
[09:13:56] <Neobenedict> sec
[09:14:37] <Neobenedict> tandroid: $('#quickpost').raw().value = $('#quickpost').raw().value +
[09:15:03] <tandroid> Neobenedict: Does it do all of this on page load or something?
[09:15:07] <Neobenedict> no
[09:15:11] <Neobenedict> when the user clicks a quote button
[09:15:33] <tandroid> So why not just check it when the user clicks the quote button. You know it's going to change then.
[09:15:46] <Neobenedict> i don't know if I can
[09:15:47] <Neobenedict> or how to
[09:15:52] <Neobenedict> this is wysibb
[09:16:05] <Neobenedict> i don't know how to access that function from another file
[09:17:33] <tandroid> Neobenedict: and I assume you've tried jquery change?
[09:17:48] <Neobenedict> change which
[09:17:52] <tandroid> .change()
[09:17:59] <Neobenedict> on?
[09:17:59] <tandroid> or the change event
[09:18:04] <tandroid> on the textarea
[09:18:14] <Neobenedict> this.$txtArea.bind("something goes here",$.proxy(this.traceTextareaEvent,this));
[09:18:28] <Neobenedict> do you know what I could do to make that fire
[09:18:37] <Neobenedict> and what to replace something goes here with
[09:18:38] <tandroid> try "change"
[09:19:13] <tandroid> I just think that it might only fire if the user is typing but not if another script does it.
[09:19:22] <tandroid> I think somebody was just asking about that a few minutes ago.
[09:19:33] <Neobenedict> that doesn't work
[09:28:59] <Neobenedict>  setInterval(function() { $.proxy(this.traceTextareaEvent,this) }, 100);
[09:29:07] <Neobenedict> how do I set this. to be the this outside the function()
[09:31:32] <shoky> setInterval($.proxy(this.traceTextareaEvent, this), 100)
[09:32:29] <shoky> but uh, just use "input" event, or keypress if you need old IE support
[09:33:07] <shoky> Neobenedict ^
[09:33:10] <Neobenedict> that doesnt work
[09:33:14] <Neobenedict> the textarea is hidden
[09:33:17] <Neobenedict> and scripts modify it
[09:33:26] <Neobenedict> input is not getting called
[09:33:30] <shoky> er.. why
[09:33:36] <Neobenedict> because this is a library
[09:33:47] <shoky> ...ok
[09:33:52] <Neobenedict> not my code :P
[09:35:11] <raul782> Hi guys, I'm using blueimp to upload images, but somehow the dropzone is not working
[09:48:00] <djam90> Hi guys, I wrote a real simple script to display a text counter next to a textbox, like 3/250, 4/250 but I am getting the error TypeError, number is not a function. http://pastebin.com/HN1HbyTy
[09:48:45] <djam90> When I console.log text.length() it gives me the number, but when I use it in the code like in the pastebin then it errors
[09:49:11] <tandroid> djam90: I think you just want text.length
[09:49:15] <tandroid> not length()
[09:49:23] <djam90> ah that worked!
[09:49:44] <djam90> is .length a standard Javascript count, and length() a jQuery thing?
[09:51:14] <tandroid> djam90: yep
[09:51:29] <djam90> ahh thanks
[09:51:56] <tandroid> no problem!
[09:56:50] <jop008> After closing a select my page is scrolled to the top how to prevent this (jqM 1.4.3 and 1.9.1)
[09:57:33] <tandroid> jop008: remove the handler that does that :)
[09:57:44] <jop008> there is no handler
[09:57:57] <jop008> it looks like default jq behaviour
[09:58:14] <jop008> how to find out which handler is doing this?
[09:58:49] <tandroid> I'm confused. are you using just a basic select menu?
[09:59:08] <jop008> yes the one that comes with jqm
[09:59:28] <jop008> which creates a modal dialogue
[09:59:46] <jop008> when closing that one the cursor is at the top of screen
[10:00:54] <Salatfreak> Hey there! Every file I load by jquery ajax calls in firefox gets interpreted as xml somehow. So I get xml errors when I try to load an html, script or text file. What do I do wrong?
[10:02:39] <jop008> So how to find the handler?
[10:03:04] <Salatfreak> * I tried the $.getScript() $("...").load() and $.get("...", "text") functions
[10:04:41] <BillCriswell> Salatfreak: Do you have this happening somewhere?
[10:04:49] <BillCriswell> .... that we can see
[10:05:51] <Salatfreak> Oh, one more information: I try to do it offline, could that be the reason?
[10:07:17] <Salatfreak> I guess it will... Nevermind :D Have a nice evening
[10:08:49] <katsh> ...
[10:10:08] <ruinze> HOw can I can I add element inside a dynamic popup element?
[10:10:28] <jeffreylevesque> on()
[10:11:06] <jrist> ruinze: get the handle of the pop-up and append?
[10:12:41] <ruinze> jeffrelevesque: Thanks, but I don't have an event. I tried the click event for the anchor but it's not working.
[10:13:25] <JenniferB2> if one only intends to target newer browsers with html5 support, is jquery redundant then?
[10:13:28] <ruinze> jrist: Thanks, the popup was from a module in drupal, I think they're using aha.
[10:14:01] <jrist> ruinze: yeah, once it comes up, you can inspect it and get the id or some other selector and then utilize that
[10:14:02] <ruinze> jrist: Thanks, the popup was from a module in drupal, I think they're using ahah. I just want to append the dynamic popup element.
[10:14:15] <jop008> Is that normal behavior after the closing of a modal dialogue page is scrolled to top?
[10:15:01] <ruinze> jrist: I got the selectors right, my problem is I don't know what is the trigger.
[10:15:02] <jop008> jqm 143
[10:15:46] <Salatfreak> Can someone tell me in which order the tags get interpreted if I $("#...").load() html code? The loaded documents contain scripts that should be executed after the rest is interpreted. Is it enough to put the <script> to the bottom of the document?
[10:16:23] <ruinze> jrist: I cannot append after DOM is fully loaded because the element is not there yet, then after it's loaded I don't know what tigger to call.
[10:18:00] <jrist> listen for that element?
[10:18:19] <jop008> can you see the events with debugging?
[10:19:18] <ruinze> jrist: How do we listen for an element? can we use .ready for one element?
[10:19:51] <jrist> ruinze: is the modal bootstrap or something?
[10:20:13] <BillCriswell> Salatfreak: http://api.jquery.com/load/#script-execution should answer any question about script tags.
[10:20:43] <jrist> you can listen for .on('shown.bs.modal')...
[10:20:54] <jrist> or something similar for other modals
[10:20:59] <ruinze> jrist: I think it's ahah. The developers used a module for the popup in drupal, really no time to check the whole setup right now.
[10:21:43] <ruinze> jrist: I see, thanks. That's something that I can start on. Really appreciate the help.
[10:21:43] <jrist> shouldn't matter if it is ahahahahaha
[10:21:55] <ruinze> :)
[10:22:20] <jop008> My own falut (again :-)
[10:23:04] <JenniferB2> Hi! If one only intends to target newer browsers with html5 support, is jquery redundant then?
[10:23:17] <jrist> html5 != jquery
[10:25:04] <jrist> JenniferB2: html5 only specifies the markup
[10:25:17] <jrist> JenniferB2: jquery is for javscript, which specifies how markup interacts, where necessary
[10:28:53] <mnms_> Hi. Have little problem jquery validation engine
[10:29:15] <mnms_> When I submit form post is send something about 3 times
[10:29:25] <mnms_> Someone has idea why ?
[10:30:14] <Salatfreak> BillCriswell: I guess that site doesn't but usually if I link a script inside of an html document it should always be loaded/executed after html parsing, right?
[10:31:01] <jop008> how can I trigger the close of a select item?
[10:31:47] <jop008> onchange if fired but that is not the same
[10:38:32] <jop008> if htis is my dialogue <div role='dialog; class='ui-dialog-contain ui-overlay-shadow ui-corner-all>
[10:38:46] <jop008> how can I trap an event on this
[10:39:18] <jop008> I want to know when the div becomes hidden

[10:51:56] <jrist> selects are terrible, not easy to work with across browsers
[10:52:23] <coxaLT> Hello, would there be anyone who could help me
[10:52:24] <coxaLT> ?
[10:55:14] <tandroid> coxaLT: Just ask the question. If somebody can help you they will.
[10:56:37] <jop008> link is dead http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/
[10:57:05] <coxaLT> Would there be anyone, who could help me to find or name a project wich would do similar action
[10:57:10] <coxaLT> To the example of: http://jsfiddle.net/hmg17bk1/
[10:57:48] <coxaLT> I am looking for jquery plugin wich would help me create header with multiple images inside wich would like to another pages
[10:58:55] <jop008> can find end select event http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/
[11:01:24] <jop008> only 1 event for the select

[11:14:34] <MarkyC> Assume I have an HTML structure like: <div><input /><span><i></i></span></div>. How can I target the `i` tag from the `input` tag, using selectors?
[11:15:08] <MarkyC> so the input and span's are siblings, and the i is a child of the span
[11:22:43] <P1RATEZ> Am I doing something wrong on this page? I've followed the jquery accordion from the demo page and implemented it here http://www.miltontools.com/Scripts/accordion.htm (view source). It fails to work when I use it on http://www.miltontools.com/Products/products.htm. I have a suspecion it's some CSS that's causing conflicts with it. Also note that I can't click the link on the products page,
[11:22:43] <P1RATEZ> ideas what causes that?
[11:23:30] <eipieqng1> Easy question. What web based collabrative coding tools do you all like?
[11:31:30] <PrintsAMD> hi guys, i used form.valid() to validate my from, how can i reset the form?
[11:31:51] <PrintsAMD> so it wont show 'this field is required'..
[11:35:49] <djMax> I have a "fast scrolling" log ul, and I want to slideUp(fn () { remove }) - but it's not working. Are overlapping animation/removes not supported?
[11:53:25] <krambiorix> when using window.location = '/getmypdf/' , my firefox download file dialog opens. I want to trigger that event. How can i do that?
[11:55:01] <lando23> hey guys. it's not really a jquery question but a basic canvas question: i'm pulling out my hair because I don't know why my setPixel() function isn't working. http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/rzaj2joo/1/
[11:55:35] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: just how you're doing it?  don't really understand
[12:01:21] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, i use window.location = '/getmypdf/'  ->this returns a PDF
[12:01:43] <NoiseEee> ok
[12:01:44] <NoiseEee> and
[12:02:10] <krambiorix> so this returns a PDF and Firefox opens a download popup
[12:02:25] <NoiseEee> because the url /getmypdf/ send the headers to do so
[12:02:30] <NoiseEee> s/sends/
[12:02:30] <krambiorix> just before the browser popup opens i want to hide my block div
[12:02:41] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, yes, it should be like that
[12:03:10] <NoiseEee> so hide the div and then do the window.location?  i must be missing something
[12:03:52] <raul782_> Hi guys, I'm using a library to that implements drag and drop, but so far it doesn't work, what error should be looking at
[12:05:12] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, it takes some time till the PDF is generated, that's why i show a loading div
[12:05:47] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: ohhh... yeah afaik you can't control any of that. i have a similar thing in one of my app; i just do a setTimeout that roughly approximates a 'generation time' and then clears the div
[12:06:54] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, hmmm, isn't there anything else?
[12:07:21] <NoiseEee> no; fact is you're actually changing location / a new  URI is being called
[12:07:38] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, what a pitty
[12:07:54] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: you might have a bit more luck if you launch that pdf in a new window
[12:08:08] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: as that new window will never materialize; it will just be your download prompt
[12:08:10] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, then the user has a blank page, which is not ideal...
[12:08:16] <krambiorix> ow
[12:08:27] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, but can i catch that event then?
[12:08:29] <NoiseEee> no, not at all.  window.open('/mypdfthingy/')
[12:09:05] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, then i don't have my loader too :)
[12:09:06] <NoiseEee> no, you'd still have to do the setTimeout. I'm mentioning that because afaik you'd *have* to go that route for a div to disappear, since replacing the window.location would clear any scripts from the browser
[12:11:00] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, i'll try it
[12:11:57] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[12:25:54] <scri66le> anyone use hellojs?
[12:36:06] <P1RATEZ> PrintsAMD: perform the opposite operation on the field, if it sets it to 'show' then run the opposite function that sets it to 'hide'..
[12:36:47] <PrintsAMD> P1RATEZ, seems there is no easy way to reset my fields, i'll just have to write a big wrapper, i was running from that
[12:37:56] <P1RATEZ> ic
[12:38:41] <PrintsAMD> its sad that valid() would activate some css and there is no function deactivate (clear) those css set by .valid()
[12:40:54] <marc_v92> PrintsAMD: I’m assuming you’re using the jQuery validate plugin, in which case: http://jqueryvalidation.org/Validator.resetForm/
[12:41:32] <PrintsAMD> marc_v92, i use the function '.valid()' not validate
[12:41:44] <PrintsAMD> maybe i should switch?
[12:42:42] <marc_v92> PrintsAMD: Are you using that plugin, though?
[12:43:02] <PrintsAMD> marc_v92, i have it loaded i think
[12:43:26] <PrintsAMD> marc_v92, it's loaded
[12:44:15] <marc_v92> PrintsAMD: According to http://jqueryvalidation.org/valid/ you have to call validate() before you call valid()
[12:44:52] <PrintsAMD> hm...
[12:44:55] <PrintsAMD> HMMMMMMMMMM
[12:44:58] <PrintsAMD> thanks marc_v92
[12:45:08] <marc_v92> PrintsAMD: Either way, I think the resetForm() function is what you’re after.
[12:45:23] <marc_v92> PrintsAMD: No worries, let me know how it works out. Might come in handy for one of my own upcoming projects.
[12:45:32] <PrintsAMD> i guess if i ACTUALLY calls validate(), reseForm will work
[12:46:03] <PrintsAMD> ok marc_v92
[12:56:06] <Eiam> when I include jquery-2.1.1.min.js (from the website) in my app, I get RangeError: Maximum call stack exceeded on page load
[12:57:13] <Eiam> I'm not making any jquery calls myself
[12:57:23] <marc_v92> Eiam: Do you have a link we could check?
[12:57:52] <tandroid> Also, check your timeline tab in chrome Eiam
[12:58:35] <Eiam> no I'm doing dev inside an VM at the moment. let me drop in the un-minified code
[12:58:37] <Eiam> and see what line is dying
[13:04:40] <Eiam> okay in the process of creating a gist, I noticed a line of code in another framework that was doing something in the error stack, it looks like if I load that code after jquery, it causes an issue, if i load jquery second, it works fine
[13:07:33] <Eiam> so, thank you for rubber ducking, and I'm sorry for the noise =)
[13:08:18] <marc_v92> Eiam: No worries, glad you got it sorted. :)
[13:08:33] <Eiam> I logged a bug against them =)
[13:27:38] <sniperh4x0r> if a function is currently running is it possible to have an event listener of a click that tells the function to stop running immediately?
[13:27:52] <sniperh4x0r> i have an intro animation function that happens but i want to introduce a skip button
[13:28:01] <sniperh4x0r> i
[13:28:14] <sniperh4x0r> i'm not sure how to get the intro animiation function to stop after click
[13:30:07] <zzaichik> It's an animation. You can use .stop(); maybe? Are you using setInterval() or anything like that?
[13:31:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use .stop() on the element you're running the animation against.
[13:31:44] <sniperh4x0r> this is what my animation function looks like function sliderTransition() { 	$(window).on('load', function () { 	 setTimeout(function() {         FadeAnimatedTextIn();     }, 300);     setTimeout(function() {         FadeAnimatedText();     }, 1600);     setTimeout(function() {         Slide2FadeIn();     }, 2000);     setTimeout(function() {         FadeAnimatedTextIn();     }, 3300);     setTimeout(function() {         FadeAnimat
[13:31:46] <sniperh4x0r> whopse
[13:31:51] <sniperh4x0r> http://jsfiddle.net/fyxgy58x/
[13:32:00] <sniperh4x0r> sorry didnt mean to paste my code
[13:32:32] <zzaichik> So wouldn't  .on('click', function() { $(window).stop(); }); work
[13:37:09] <robertmaxrees> those animations aren't happening on the window object, either.
[13:37:36] <scri66le> anyone use hellojs?
[13:37:39] <zzaichik> Yeah it looks like whatever's in the other functions are what's being targeted.
[13:38:22] <zzaichik> robertmaxrees: do you know if timeouts stack like setInterval?
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> they don't.  in this case, this dude's trying to basically create a queue.
[13:40:37] <sniperh4x0r> can i use delay on functions? like foo().delay(500)?
[13:40:50] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r you can use it on animations.
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn about deferreds and queueting
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> *queueing
[13:41:31] <sniperh4x0r> =\
[13:42:05] <sniperh4x0r> so you mean i have to use it on say #('foo').fadein("fast").delay(300);   ?
[13:42:45] <sniperh4x0r> there is no way i can just tell a function to immediately break?
[13:43:09] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:44:27] <sniperh4x0r> cant i just do something like If(#skipintro is click) {Return;} else{do that function}
[13:44:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good way to do it.
[13:44:41] <sniperh4x0r> wait nvm that wouldnt work
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> what are each of these functions actually doing?
[13:54:08] <_2_Valentine2> Coucou !!!
[13:55:00] <sniperh4x0r> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/fyxgy58x/1/
[13:55:24] <sniperh4x0r> so basically i have to make a long chain of fadeins and outs
[13:55:32] <sniperh4x0r> with delays in between each
[13:55:52] <sniperh4x0r> err hmm
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/queue/ check this out.
[13:56:37] <sniperh4x0r> well anyway im heading home
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm you're working against multiple elements.
[13:56:42] <sniperh4x0r> my time is up for the work day
[13:56:52] <sniperh4x0r> yea
[13:56:58] <sniperh4x0r> anyway dont worry about it
[13:57:07] <sniperh4x0r> i'm not gonna be coding this until monday at least
[13:57:11] <sniperh4x0r> thanks for the heads up though
[13:57:41] <scri66le> anyone use hellojs?
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ scri66le
[13:57:50] <b-ot> scri66le: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> scri66le though I will say that you might not get much help with that here.
[14:00:26] <scri66le> simple get friends function returns a 0 array -> http://pastebin.com/tKKrEDnJ
[14:00:30] <scri66le> not sure what I"m doing wrong
[14:00:34] <MACscr> hmm, shouldnt: if (/^[a-zA-Z0-9-]*$/.test(domain) == false) { … } test false if domain was empty as well?
[14:02:27] <robertmaxrees> scri66le they have docs with functioning examples.  i'd take a look there.
[14:02:36] <scri66le> did
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> we're not really going to be of much help here :)
[14:03:28] <scri66le> reason I asked if anyone knew much about hellojs
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> offtopic for the room :)
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> MACscr what's the character class supposed to be?
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> that last bit i'm confused by.
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> you want a-z (upper and lower), 0-9, and hyphens?
[14:09:38] <robertmaxrees> MACscr the asterisk is probably what's tripping that up.
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> try using + instead and see if that's what you want.
[14:15:57] <MACscr> robertmaxrees: thanks. Im just trying to allow characters that are allowed for a domain name
[14:16:00] <MACscr> without the tld
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to have an extra check to make sure that the domain doesn't start or end with a hyphen.
[14:18:35] <MACscr> good point
[14:19:04] <MACscr> suggestions for that? =)

[14:20:24] <hancock> Ey!
[14:21:57] <hancock> When I put "$(function() { //stuff });" in a script-tag in the head of my html, will it execute on start-up?
[14:22:30] <robertmaxrees> hancock that's the same as using a document ready
[14:22:32] <hancock> Also, what is the difference from putting this in the head-tag as opposed to putting it in a .js and linking to it
[14:23:30] <hancock> Alright
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of resources out there about inline vs external js and css.
[14:24:23] <hancock> When I had a piece of code in my script-tag the whole thing broke
[14:24:41] <robertmaxrees> externally linked JS is often easier to maintain.
[14:24:42] <hancock> I moved that to the .js the other jquery works, but I am guessing that piece is still broken
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern.
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> what "piece" is broken?
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> do you have an example
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:25:24] <hancock> Trying to implement a slider: http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/
[14:25:36] <hancock> And I downloaded the .rar with examples.
[14:25:44] <hancock> And simply just implemented exactly what it had in the source
[14:26:17] <hancock> The example I followed exists online here: http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/development/camera_1.0.6/demo/features.htm
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.  and what was the problem?
[14:26:41] <hancock> The code that seems to not work exists on line:51-64
[14:26:53] <hancock> It displays nothing.
[14:26:59] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/pixedelic/Camera/blob/master/demo/features.htm btw
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> you're running this off a local server, right?
[14:27:20] <robertmaxrees> or are you just rinning it using the files?
[14:27:23] <hancock> It worked briefly, but when I changed something it broke, and even when I backtracked it wouldn't work again
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what you're doing it's impossible to help.
[14:27:36] <hancock> local server, yes. But the exact same files used
[14:27:58] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code you currently have via a fixee or something similar?
[14:28:15] <hancock> Sure
[14:28:20] <hancock> It's pretty long
[14:29:02] <robertmaxrees> lol that's fine.  not sure how else to help you :)
[14:29:03] <hancock> Should I try and cut it down for you?
[14:29:42] <robertmaxrees> functioning jsfiddles are always preferred, but the full thing in a fixee is fine.
[14:29:42] <hancock> a fixee, is that like jsfiddle?
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/home/
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> just a simple paste service, doesn't run anything.
[14:30:06] <hancock> ah
[14:30:17] <hancock> Errmm..
[14:30:51] <robertmaxrees> if you'd rather setup a functioning fiddle, that's fine too.
[14:31:35] <hancock> http://fixee.org/paste/7mfat53/
[14:32:02] <hancock> I reckon it's relevant from line 93 and below
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> btw you only need one $(function() {});
[14:32:29] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> oh.... you have two versions of jquery in ther,e too.
[14:32:54] <hancock> Yeah
[14:33:01] <robertmaxrees> remove line 23 and 25
[14:33:05] <hancock> You're referring to line 23?
[14:33:15] <hancock> 25?
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> res.  remove lines 23 and 25
[14:33:23] <robertmaxrees> you already have jquery easing included.
[14:33:24] <hancock> Oh yeah
[14:33:32] <hancock> For some reason when I added 23 it would work
[14:33:37] <hancock> for a slight second it seemed
[14:33:41] <robertmaxrees> remove that
[14:33:56] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[14:33:56] <hancock> removed
[14:34:20] <robertmaxrees> that's why.  your plugin was last updated in 2012.  that means it likely won't work with any version of jquery after 1.8
[14:34:37] <hancock> Oh
[14:35:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd get a new plugin at that point.  your other option is to include jquery migrate on th e page as well.
[14:35:32] <hancock> I don't think I really need the newest version for any of the other code
[14:35:40] <hancock> Let's just see if it fixes it first
[14:35:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd use the newest if possible.
[14:36:22] <robertmaxrees> also, if you care about old IE, the 1.x series is a better bet than the 2.x series.  same features, just includes support for old IE.
[14:36:34] <hancock> Hmm
[14:45:50] <hancock> I removed the 2.1 and added only the jquery.min
[14:45:50] <hancock> and my collapsable header disappeared (not included in the paste)
[14:45:51] <robertmaxrees> :)\
[14:45:51] <hancock> The slider-plugin was still not displayed though
[14:45:51] <robertmaxrees> you probably have other errors.
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> use a new version and jquery migrate.  if that still doesn't work, look at your console and see what errors you're getting.
[14:45:55] <hancock> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'touchstart' of undefined jquery.mobile.customized.min.js:10
[14:45:55] <hancock> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function index.html:166
[14:45:55] <hancock> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined "
[14:45:55] <hancock> :/
[14:45:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's with jquery migrate included right after your jquery include?
[14:45:58] <hancock> Adding the jquery migrate worked quite well
[14:46:00] <hancock> robertmaxrees: Adding the jquery migrate worked quite well
[14:46:00] <robertmaxrees> not ignoring you :)
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> just got my moto 360 all setup
[14:46:14] <jDavid> Does anyone know where I can go to help with an existing project? First time using jQuery(or any open-source) and I would like to know some of the basics. Thank you for your time.
[14:46:22] <robertmaxrees> jDavid not sure what you mean.
[14:46:26] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for a tutorial?
[14:46:45] <jDavid> yeah
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> check out learn.jquery.com
[14:47:05] <jDavid> thanks
[15:06:43] <wa5ted> yo
[15:07:29] <wa5ted> jDavid:  in my experience sometimes its good to give yourself a small project. Eg. create a small blog, no back end just working o nthe front end
[15:07:31] <wa5ted> on the*
[15:07:45] <robertmaxrees> a jekyll blog is always good times.
[15:07:57] <wa5ted> lol
[15:08:12] <wa5ted> jDavid: alternative is codeacademy or similar resoruces
[17:06:24] <blusky> hi !
[17:07:49] <blusky> i have a question about "draggable" (from jquery ui), il use a framework with onsen ui (mobile) and angular js, and when I put a div inside a view, draggable doesn't work. if i put the div directly into "body", it works. Any idea what could prevent "draggable" from working ?
[17:08:19] <il> I'll*
[17:44:12] <morenoh152> how do I achieve three buttons that act as filters? a,b,c. when the a button is pressed all the a related items show only, if a & b are pressed a & b related items show etc
[21:12:14] <anon215> Do you offer general javascript help in this channel?
[21:43:34] <sohcrates> Hello everyone! This is my first time here.
[21:46:44] <jphase> hi sohcrates, welcome
[21:48:42] <sohcrates> Thanks! I am reading the jquery website to see how I help. I am not too confident right now though. I am student and haven't learned jquery! Any tips?
[21:55:22] <jphase> sohcrates: not unless you have something specific you're wanting to do, no
[21:58:45] <sohcrates> Since I am not a pro at the code, think I could contribute to Documentation? I would like to help with the Q & A as well
[22:01:30] <sohcrates> Is the channel normally more active than this?
[22:01:49] <jphase> sohcrates: yeah it's early for a lot of ppl right now
[22:01:54] <jphase> http://contribute.jquery.org/ is a good resource
[22:03:46] <sohcrates> Ah, I see. Thanks for the link.
[22:04:02] <sohcrates> I'll read up on that right quick
[22:05:46] <raul782> Hi guys, I'm trying to understand drag and drop, do you know how this works in a widget?
[22:06:27] <raul782> jquery widget?
[22:06:29] <jphase> raul782: if you're referring to jQuery UI's drag and drop, they're two different methods to connect lists or items
[22:07:13] <raul782> yeah correct
[22:07:15] <raul782> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js#L1265
[22:08:01] <raul782> this is the library I'm using, but somehow, when I drop an image on the document, it load the image on the browser
[22:08:27] <raul782> instead of dropping the files in the form
[22:09:03] <jphase> oh, well that's not jQuery UI then
[22:10:41] <raul782> jphase: I believe it extends $.widget
[22:10:56] <raul782> which is part of JQuery UI or am I wrong?
[22:11:08] <jphase> oh sure
[22:11:16] <jphase> but the drop/drag listeners aren't jquery ui
[22:11:33] <jphase> so I'm not totally sure about those events - I'd start by confirming they fire
[22:11:47] <raul782> oh Ic
[22:12:12] <jphase> I mean, the default dropzone looks like $(document)
[22:12:35] <jphase> so it sounds like the browser is taking over unless you're overriding the dropzone in the options
[22:12:53] <raul782> exactly,
[22:12:58] <jphase> you'd think this would be fixed if you're in chrome/ff/safari though, not sure
[22:14:13] <raul782> I'm in chrome, and I can see this method is called, where it uses e.preventDefault() https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js#L55
[22:14:42] <raul782> that should take care of not allowing the browser default action taking over right?
[22:15:20] <jphase> typically - depends on the action
[22:15:24] <jphase> any js errors?
[22:16:29] <raul782> none
[22:16:50] <raul782> and If I upload the file directly, it works, it just doesn't work the drag and drop feature
[22:16:58] <raul782> I mean using the form
[22:17:11] <raul782> and input file it works w/o problems
[22:18:16] <jphase> hmm, yeah idk
[22:22:13] <raul782> jphase: thanks, one more question when you instantiate a widget, what methods are executed by default?
[22:23:27] <jphase> raul782: I'd have to view the source to be sure, but I'm sure there's an init and probably some complete(d)/render(ed) events
[22:23:36] <jphase> should all be in their UI docs
[22:23:46] <jphase> most plugins only have around 2 events on init
[22:24:34] <jphase> yeah, there's a create() event for sure
[22:24:48] <jphase> bah, 'create' event that is
[22:25:07] <jphase> the rest look like methods
[22:25:31] <raul782> got it, thanks a lot yeah that is _create the one that is called first
[22:26:18] <jphase> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[22:26:50] <raul782> cool, I'm reading it now, thanks
