[07:11:32] <Cypris> is there a way to tell if a given string is a valid attribute or propertry for a given element? for example, $("<div>").attr("cypris") isn't a valid attribute for a div element. I is there a way to test for that?
[09:56:38] <Freneticks> Hi how to chain ajax function in a correct order, and passing value trough them ? https://pastebin.com/raw/3iNXiQsD
[10:09:25] <Woet> Freneticks: put the functions inside the success event.
[10:11:43] <Freneticks> Woet: succes event is not deprecated for .done and .fail ?
[10:11:50] <Woet> Freneticks: the docs will tell you
[10:12:01] <Woet> Freneticks: I use success, but it might be deprecated by now.
[10:12:08] <Freneticks> I already try with succes and doesn't work
[10:13:20] <Woet> Freneticks: show your code.
[10:46:06] <Freneticks> Woet: something i don't understand i try to foreach(anotherajaxfunction()) inside a .done but it first execute code after the foreach, and then execute the foreach
[10:46:08] <Freneticks> so weird
[10:46:30] <Woet> Freneticks: show your code.
