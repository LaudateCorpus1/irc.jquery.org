[00:09:15] <b-ot> how come this doesn't work? $(this+".item") ?????!!?!?!?!?!!!!?!
[00:17:58] <greg5green> b-ot, because this isnt a reference to a selector, its a reference to an object
[00:18:32] <greg5green> so you are basically saying, lookup "CRAZYOBJECTTHATIDIDNTEXPECT.item"
[00:19:47] <greg5green> I think you can do $(this).find(".item") to get what you are looking for, but im not sure
[00:20:02] <greg5green> docs say descendent, but I feel like it should work
[00:20:11] <greg5green> and am too lazy to mock anything up to check
[00:20:16] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[00:20:44] <greg5green> oh duh
[00:20:44] <greg5green> its
[00:20:52] <greg5green> $(this).filter(".item")
[00:20:54] <lxsameer> how can i select an element with data-x="1"?
[00:21:04] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[00:22:34] <greg5green> $("[data-x='1']")
[00:22:48] <greg5green> should be right, but, once again, too lazy to mock anything up to doublecheck
[00:23:03] <greg5green> but you should rethink that as a method to find something because it isnt a terribly fast selector
[00:23:14] <greg5green> you probably need a star in there too
[00:23:15] <greg5green> :/
[00:23:23] <greg5green> or the element type
[00:23:39] <greg5green> $("a[data-x='x']"), for example
[00:24:50] <djQuery> greg5green. lxsameer , what you said will work but you are right about it being one of the slower selectors
[00:25:00] <greg5green> i think something more like
[00:25:13] <lxsameer> djQuery: do you have any faster suggestion ?
[00:25:30] <greg5green> $('broaderSelector").data("x") === '1'
[00:25:37] <greg5green> in an if statement might work better if you can make it work
[00:26:10] <djQuery> lxsameer, $('broaderselector').filter('[data-x=1]')
[00:26:25] <lxsameer> djQuery: thanks
[00:26:41] <djQuery> lxsameer, or .find depending on what broader slector returns
[00:26:42] <greg5green> yeah, that too
[00:26:58] <greg5green> helps to run only 5 elements instead of 1000
[00:27:27] <greg5green> what are you trying to set up?
[00:27:55] <greg5green> nm, it doesnt matter i dont think
[00:28:21] <greg5green> i was thinking about setting up event delegation for event handlers in dojo, but idk if it would make much of a difference here
[00:29:47] <greg5green> maybe .addBack() would be useful too
[00:30:36] <greg5green> oops, nevermind, .addBack might help b-ot
[00:30:42] <greg5green> no you lxsameer
[00:30:52] <greg5green> not*
[00:39:34] <limpc> any idea what would cause a sortable to always drop elements to the bottom of the list?  I'm dragging it from a draggable container, and I see a placeholder in the sortable indicating where I'm dropping it (e.g. mid-list). but when I drop it, it jumps to the bottom
[00:39:58] <greg5green> no

[03:10:53] <iolsson> Hi. I've just been reading up on the Same Origin Policy, XMLHTTPRequests and some related topics but I can't for the life of me figure out how to build an ajax website that retreives xml data from a server other than the hosting server without having control over the hosting server. Is this possible?
[03:12:05] <iolsson> So.. I want to build a webpage that's hosted by a hosting provider. This page should fetch xml data (weather data) from a content provider server and then update the webpage based on this data. Do I have to have control over the hosting server in order to be able to do this?
[03:13:45] <iolsson> It seems the client that opens the page can't make the request towards the weather data provider since it's not from the same origin. One way to solve this would be to build a service running on the webserver that fetches the weather data and makes it available locally but this, again, requires control over the hosting server
[03:14:15] <iolsson> (I'm trying to use $.ajax() )
[03:15:27] <plopper> it's called "same origin policy"
[03:16:04] <iolsson> plopper: so i have to make the data available locally on the server side?
[03:16:22] <iolsson> so that from the clients perspective it's from the same origin?
[03:17:10] <plopper> basically yes
[03:17:50] <iolsson> ok, thanks. coming from embedded development this is really confusing :/
[03:21:54] <plopper> iolsson: but there is example: JSONP
[03:39:10] <mrHatx> hello
[03:39:55] <mrHatx> i have serveral radio buttons and i need to check if any radio is selected and if none, select the first radio. how can i do this?
[03:44:25] <plopper> $("#myform input[type='radio']:checked").val();
[03:52:58] <mrHatx> plopper ok, but how do i select the 1st radio if none is selected ?
[03:55:37] <plopper> mrHatx: <input type="radio" value="1st" checked /> ?
[03:58:06] <plopper> or if($("#myform input[type='radio']:checked").val();
[03:58:29] <plopper> ).length == 0) {}
[03:59:58] <plopper> sorry, this is right: if($("#myform input[type='radio']:checked").length == 0) {}
[04:03:13] <mrHatx> i did > if (!$("#formadepagogroup input[type='radio']:checked").val())  to check if anything is checked
[04:03:28] <mrHatx> and $("#formadepagogroup input[type='radio']:first").attr('checked', true); to check the 1st radio

[05:24:45] <Tuttle> hi, i have a form with radios, text inputs and checkboxes. all of these can be without value but the target GET URL then looks full of useless fields. is there a way to remove those unused fields before submit?
[05:26:47] <deepy> I'm doing a $('#myUL').append().html("<li>foo</li>"); it works fine the first time
[05:26:59] <deepy> but when I do it the second time I get <li>foofoo</li>
[05:28:14] <tdignan> deepy: show code for the whole thing, first and second time?
[05:29:09] <tdignan> seems you don't ned the .html() call.
[05:29:10] <deepy> tdignan: http://jsbin.com/umokuw/1/
[05:30:38] <plopper> deepy: $('#myURL').append("<li>foo</li>");
[05:31:23] <deepy> Not quite sure where I got the .html() call from
[05:31:44] <deepy> cheers
[05:36:15] <deepy> And if I have a .click listener for all li's already, how would I apply it to the newly created ones?
[05:37:44] <tdignan> deepy: http://jsbin.com/umokuw/2/
[05:37:49] <tdignan> is that what you wanted?
[05:58:36] <bencc> How can put an input element inside a jquery-mobile button?

[05:58:51] <deepy> tdignan: yeah, but jus removing .html() sort of solved it too :P
[05:58:53] <bencc> but it styles the hidden input tag

[06:28:34] <sunbeam> I would like to use this only if a tablet in portrait mode is viewing my site
[06:28:47] <sunbeam> or if the browser width is between 600 and 960px any idea how i do this?

[07:43:01] <Jetien> Hi. Chromium (maybe Google Chrome too) seems to have this quirk: If you drop files into the browser too fast the event handlers are not called. See http://jsfiddle.net/NWcH4/2/ as an example. If i drop an image too fast it will try to open it. Does anybody know a workaround for this? Or am I missing something?
[07:45:23] <sunbeam> Conditional meta tag when the browser width is between 600px and 768px
[07:45:26] <sunbeam> how can i best accomplish this?
[07:46:37] <tdignan> sunbeam: could you explain to me for my own education why that would make sense
[07:46:43] <tdignan> I thought meta meant 'before'
[07:46:49] <tdignan> i.e. way before the browser even has geometry
[07:48:38] <priyanshu> want to add video slides as well in the nivo slider how can i add
[07:48:56] <sunbeam> tdignan: I cannot make respnosive css for this width, so when the site is opened on tablet portrait mode i want it to scale down

[08:29:16] <brian___> hey guys, im using ajax to update a form. im able to submit the form once, but not after that initial update. im using $(document).on('submit', form', function() { … } any thoughts why this might not be working properly?
[08:29:33] <ryanneufeld> wolfehr: find is going to be more efficient.
[08:30:07] <muffinrecon> dont use document?
[08:30:20] <muffinrecon> because that runs when the thing fully loads, no?
[08:30:21] <wolfehr> really? That's a surprise, I would have thought directly specifying for implicit iteration would have been quicker
[08:30:30] <brian___> muffinrecon: i've tried specifying the div and thats not working either
[08:30:36] <muffinrecon> ah
[08:30:40] <ryanneufeld> wolfehr: using .find90 is faster

[08:32:08] <wolfehr> ryanneufeld, what about find() vs children() when there's only one level of child? I assume they map to the same thing?
[08:32:23] <ryanneufeld> wolfehr: i'm not sure off the top of my head
[08:32:49] <ryanneufeld> wolfehr: http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-children-and-id-selector/10
[08:33:05] <djQuery> wolfer you can always create a jsperf of each different method
[08:34:17] <brian___> it's a rails app, i hope this is enough info to give: http://jsbin.com/ezomov/1/edit
[08:34:40] <wolfehr> ryanneufeld, it looks like $('#parent #child') actually performs find anyway from that test suite
[08:34:46] <Lightheaded> Hey! Has anyone encountered the firefox bug when using .fadeTo on a div with a background image? The image size changes with opacity for some reason. By a few pixels, but it's annoying as hell..

[08:35:24] <deepy> I'm using the jQuery ui tabs widget, how do I make a hyperlink to a specific tab?
[08:35:39] <ryanneufeld> brian___: your problem is $('#cart-inner').html(data.template);
[08:35:49] <ryanneufeld> brian___: you're overwriting the form that was bound
[08:36:16] <ryanneufeld> brian___: without re-binding the submit.
[08:36:34] <brian___> ok i think i see what you mean. is it possible to re-bind ?

[08:37:15] <zergion> I am playing around with fileinputs, however when I select a file I get C:\fakepath\myfile.jpg. Can I remove everything before the actual filename? Path is irrelevant
[08:38:40] <Lightheaded> Nevermind, I found the culprit for my problem. If anyone is interested: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=489020
[08:39:01] <ryanneufeld> zergion: each browser and OS will give you different values for that.
[08:39:30] <zergion> well I know some browsers wont allow js to grab the file path. Can I remove it all together and only display filename?
[08:40:19] <ryanneufeld> zergion: in my experience. Not reliably.
[08:40:21] <djQuery> zergion, you either going to get intimate with substring and lastIndexOf or do a split of the string on \ and get the last one in the array
[08:45:34] <brian___> ryanneufeld: i thought that was the purpose of on to begin with. i tried this update, but still nothing, any thoughts? http://jsbin.com/ezomov/1/edit
[08:48:03] <wolfehr> also another quick q, is it quicker to chain amendments to a jquery object ending each context with end, or performing it separately (e.g. $object.find('whatever').val('foo').end().find('.somethingelse').val('bar'); vs $object.find('.whatever').val('asd'); $.object.find('somethingelse').val('sdf'); ?

[09:56:57] <draconusit> Can anyone help me out in trying to get a parallax script fixed that isn't quite firing right?
[09:57:19] <draconusit> I would greatly appreciate it
[09:58:44] <sekyms> Anyone have any backbone experience?
[09:59:03] <sekyms> I can't access this model attributes data for some reason, it's an array
[10:00:15] <draconusit> I am following this tutorial: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/12/behind-the-scenes-of-nike-better-world/
[10:00:31] <draconusit> And trying to apply it the the site I am working on, which you can see here:
[10:00:33] <draconusit> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/12/behind-the-scenes-of-nike-better-world/
[10:01:11] <draconusit> (Please pardon that it is a bit on the messy side at the moment since whether I can get the parallax working or not will determine some of the more specific design elements)
[10:02:38] <draconusit> And in the parallax.js file, the $('section[data-type="background"]').each(function(){ isnt firing
[10:03:43] <draconusit> (to verify that the block wasnt firing i pluggedin an alert(); to test where it stopped firing)
[10:06:53] <deepy> I have a jquery tab called 4, I'm currently trying to find it when getting a tabsbeforeactivate thing
[10:07:02] <deepy> but innerText and outerText are both undefined ;_;
[10:07:06] <draconusit> not that I am impatient but can anyone see my posts? I dont see anyone elses posts so I am questioning my connection to this channel
[10:07:19] <sekyms> draconusit: i can see them
[10:07:29] <draconusit> oh good.thnx
[10:07:31] <sekyms> the second iink you posted was to nikes site not yours
[10:07:52] <draconusit> woops
[10:08:00] <draconusit> http://draconus.dreamhosters.com/parallax/
[10:08:22] <draconusit> Well not nike site, just a nike site style parallax tutorial on smashing
[10:09:49] <draconusit> @sekyms whatcha think
[10:11:30] <tw2113> man, i'm a little torn...do i go with a jQuery sticker? or just a js sticker
[10:11:30] <draconusit> I like the smashing mags take on how to achieve the parallax because it is a much lighter solution than most, not all the additional smooth scrolling script etc.
[10:12:01] <tw2113> and really, if i go with the js one, it encompasses anything that uses it, including jquery
[10:12:24] <draconusit> most of the parallax effect is achieved by css, and just the speeding of the elements is js
[10:14:29] <draconusit> that lighter weight implementation will help me when I start working on making it responsive with the media queries after I get the full size working
[10:18:11] <deepy> http://jsbin.com/adenud/1/edit
[10:18:19] <deepy> why is innerText undefined?
[10:19:05] <deepy> and how do I tell what tab I clicked on?
[10:21:00] <draconusit> Holy crap I am an idiot
[10:21:05] <draconusit> disregard my question
[10:21:17] <draconusit> I am calling the javascript on sections and I am using divs
[10:21:19] <draconusit> lol
[10:26:11] <Teduardo> Does anyone know what would cause the text on a jqueryui dialog button to not be displayed?
[10:26:33] <limpc> any idea what would cause a sortable to always drop elements to the bottom of the list?  I'm dragging it from a draggable container, and I see a placeholder in the sortable indicating where I'm dropping it (e.g. mid-list). but when I drop it, it jumps to the bottom
[10:26:42] <limpc> i have a sample of it at http://jsfiddle.net/Qn5hc/1/
[10:27:06] <limpc> when you drag images to the sortable container (blue box), note the media ID which is the image ID
[10:27:28] <basiclaser_> djQuery, thanks, i was just curious becuase i have a baby project that i would like to structure a particular way foundationally but id like it to be ultimately open source :)
[10:32:22] <kokoat> https://squareup.com where is the script that keeps the nav bar on top when you scroll? i can't seem to find it
[10:33:34] <tw2113> you mean scroll left/right through the slider thing?
[10:33:51] <kokoat> no. when you click a nav link, the page smooth scrolls
[10:34:03] <kokoat> but when the nav reaches the top, its position becomes fixed
[10:34:12] <tw2113> that's probably the answer right there
[10:34:17] <tw2113> fixed positioning
[10:34:48] <tw2113> css
[10:34:56] <kokoat> ok. and if you keep scrolling, as you reach certain sectioons, the corresponding nav link changes its style. how do i detect such things?
[10:35:06] <tw2113> that would probably be a js trick
[10:35:17] <kokoat> trying to think of how its done though..
[10:35:31] <limpc> i can haz helps? :/
[10:35:33] <kokoat> can't be if element(Section) is visible, set nav link's css
[10:35:44] <kokoat> because someone with a large monitor might have more than one section visible
[10:36:20] <limpc> kokoat: probably anchors
[10:36:32] <limpc> anchors and scrollpos.
[10:36:35] <kokoat> what if more than one anchor is visible
[10:36:38] <djQuery> kokoat, not if you resize the sections to the size of the window
[10:36:46] <kokoat> oh
[10:37:16] <deepy> how come ui.newTab.innerText is undefined? http://jsbin.com/adenud/5/edit
[10:37:51] <limpc> djQuery: thanks for the help yesterday. i just have the sort issue now
[10:38:53] <djQuery> deepy, because ui.newtab is a jquery object
[10:39:48] <djQuery> deepy, console.log(ui.newTab.text());
[10:40:23] <deepy> oh man, sorry for spamming so much XD
[10:40:30] <deepy> I've been staring myself blind, going over .text a hundred times
[10:40:34] <djQuery> deepy, or console.log(ui.newTab[0].innerText);
[10:40:38] <deepy> Wihout the ()
[10:40:57] <deepy> Thanks djQuery <3
[10:41:26] <djQuery> deepy, when you run into that drop back one in you console.log
[10:41:41] <djQuery> deepy, I figured it out by console.log(ui.newTab);
[10:42:49] <deepy> I did, and then I clicked and saw that innerText and outerText was set
[10:42:55] <deepy> haste makes waste
[10:43:34] <deepy> Okay, yeah, great. in that I cannot use a function I defined outside
[10:43:45] <deepy> Person is not defined
[10:43:49] <tw2113> oh scoping
[10:44:47] <deepy> but this function is rather long, I don't want to repeat it :(
[10:45:22] <deepy> can I pass it a reference to the function?
[10:51:34] <hazamonzo_> might be a silly question folks but... looking at this doc i can see that the vars xml and title are declared with a $ prepended to the beginning of them. Is there any reason for this. Last time i saw something like this was vars in php i think
[10:51:45] <hazamonzo_> Is this just a var naming convention im not familiar with?
[10:51:52] <hazamonzo_> oh, the doc... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[10:52:50] <tw2113> "A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase)."
[10:53:33] <tw2113> the word to the right of the "var" keyword is the identifier
[10:54:31] <hazamonzo_> tw2113: so its nothing special then?
[10:54:39] <tw2113> doesn't look like it
[10:54:46] <tw2113> i imagine most people omit for smaller file sizes
[10:54:52] <hazamonzo_> in this example we just have two vars... one called xml and another called $xml
[10:55:13] <tw2113> my best guess is that xml != $xml
[10:55:20] <tw2113> it may be 2 vars
[10:55:49] <hazamonzo_> tw2113: i think so too. Okay then. I was just a tad freaked when i saw the whole $varName... looked a lot like php to me
[10:55:55] <hazamonzo_> And i haven't done that in years :)
[10:56:02] <tw2113> it happens ;)
[10:56:08] <hazamonzo_> (whew)
[10:56:11] <djQuery> most likely xml will be the actual xml and $xml will be a jquery object
[10:56:24] <djQuery> $xml = $(xml);
[10:56:25] <hazamonzo_> djQuery: Yeah i think so too looking at the sample
[10:56:34] <hazamonzo_> just seems like a good naming convention for vars
[10:56:54] <djQuery> I do this  a lot with my jqueyr objects
[10:57:10] <djQuery> and makes them easy to pick out in code completion
[10:57:12] <hazamonzo_> djQuery: Cool! I like to learn good practises
[10:57:15] <hazamonzo_> djQuery: I agree
[10:57:46] <djQuery> hazamonzo_, on think it a good or bad practice just a prefernce
[10:58:04] <limpc> any drag/drop/sortable experts here?
[10:58:07] <hazamonzo_> tw2113: djQuery: thanks for the insight :)
[10:59:04] <djQuery> hazamonzo_, $('whatever').on('click', function(e){ var $this = $(this); $this.whatever});
[11:00:57] <hazamonzo_> djQuery: ahh i see... i usually use...  var myself = $(this);
[11:01:33] <kokoat> http://jsfiddle.net/FuRe4/ howcome the h2 inside the p isnt being targeted?
[11:01:38] <shoky> very important to know that it's YOUR self and not someone else's
[11:01:43] <kokoat> thats the most basic shit ever, lol
[11:01:52] <kokoat> it should work
[11:02:37] <djQuery> kokoat, you might try #css
[11:02:42] <kokoat> i did
[11:02:46] <djQuery> joining and asking there
[11:02:49] <kokoat> 15 mins later, i came here
[11:02:54] <djQuery> lol
[11:03:15] <kokoat> i think its an html prob. the h3 is breaking it
[11:03:30] <tw2113> kokoat, here's what firebug sees: http://d.pr/n/moQF
[11:03:32] <kokoat> but im not using > in the selector so im not sure why it would break
[11:03:32] <djQuery> shoky, inside of my function $this will be my $this
[11:04:00] <tw2113> my bets are that h# tags inside p tags are invalid markup
[11:04:32] <shoky> djQuery: i know, i was commenting on his 'myself'
[11:04:46] <shoky> kokoat: the <p>  is getting closed before the <h2>  for some reason
[11:04:54] <kokoat> ...
[11:04:58] <kokoat> that's strange?
[11:05:00] <hazamonzo_> I didn't think you could put a H2 into a P
[11:05:09] <tw2113> that's how the browser interprets correctly
[11:05:13] <hazamonzo_> *shrugs*
[11:05:14] <b-ot> hazamonzo_: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:05:14] <shoky> hmm
[11:05:28] <kokoat> html 101..no <h inside <p>
[11:06:01] <djQuery> kokoat, try replacing them with divs and spans and see if it works
[11:06:05] <limpc> haha if you highlight that smiley face
[11:06:07] <limpc> it turns into a ninja
[11:13:34] <tw2113> you're welcome http://www.devswag.com/
[11:33:13] <shoshy> hey, i would love to be able to record a dom manipulation macro (dragging and dropping element , entering text, etc.. ). Couldn't find any plugin , is this possible?
[11:36:25] <gotwig> How can I differencate between a click and a drag event? http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/index.php
[11:36:53] <gotwig> users can drag boxes without p tag easily, but with, I have to catch the event, if a user actually clicks a box
[11:37:06] <gotwig> , sry if the user clicks a p tag
[11:37:16] <pythonsnake> http://pastie.org/6367037
[11:37:18] <pythonsnake> what does that do
[11:45:52] <tw2113> it looks like it looks for .button_form and then attaches a function to the click event, prevents the default click action, then finds .button_form buttton and clicks that instead
[11:45:56] <tw2113> kind of odd
[11:54:48] <mnb> can anyone give me advice on using multiple themes with dialogs?
[11:55:30] <mnb> I'm using dialogs in a browser extension, and things predictably get borked when another site is also using jqui
[11:55:51] <mnb> I've seen tons of strategies about using wrappers, none of them quite seem to work
[11:56:05] <pythonsnake> T-Co: ok
[12:23:48] <boytoy> My photo gallery at http://bit.ly/Y4Z7BZ uses media queries for JS and CSS to drop down to a 2-column layout for anything less than 767px. Does anyone know why this does not work in ones Android browser?

[12:57:54] <dblosevn> Hey guys :-) quick question, anybody know of  a good method to do a deep comparison of 2 arrays of objects?
[13:03:44] <dblosevn> eg http://jsfiddle.net/HbHmg/ both the objects are the same but in a different order
[13:05:02] <hg_5> hello
[13:05:12] <boytoy> jQuery Mobile's fixed width positioning feature is a joke right? I.e. <ul class="nav" data-role="header" data-position="fixed"> - doesn't really work...
[13:05:53] <hg_5> i have problem on my site, when i click on image it appears slowly, i have changed jquery from 6000 to 600 , but still same problem http://hakowy.pl/kazimierzszoltysek/gallery.html
[13:17:21] <dblosevn> oh well its dirty, but i guess it works http://jsfiddle.net/HbHmg/1/
[13:25:07] <djQuery> dblosevn, couldn't you return out of the loop if any of them are dirty?
[13:40:40] <aniasis> Is it possible to disable the scrollbars using jQuer
[13:40:57] <aniasis> but still capture the event?
[13:41:26] <aniasis> I mean disable the scrollbar scroll the window but still capture the event
[13:43:39] <systemfault> You could probably add overflow: hidden to the body
[13:45:19] <jrockjiggz2> ?error
[13:46:18] <bot-t> .error(handler): Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/error/
[13:51:45] <aniasis> systemfault, I want to keep the scrollbar just disable the window scroll
[13:51:53] <aniasis> Look at artofflightmovie.com
[13:52:13] <aniasis> You see how they disabled the scrollbar's normal behavior?
[14:00:05] <Jetien> i'd like to test if the user has entered the same password into two <input>s while he is typing, so i write a handler for "onkeyup". but now ctrl+c and ctrl+v etc are not working anymore in the fields. any ideas?
[14:08:03] <Jetien> disregard that
[14:19:01] <gamesNmusic> How can I remove a page/dialog after it has been visited once? For instance, I only want to display a rules/agreement page/dialog only the very first time a user has visited my webisite... any time after that, the user is just directed to the website.
[14:19:19] <systemfault> You'd use a cookie
[14:23:57] <gamesNmusic> Thanks systemfault. I'll look into that
[14:29:08] <fr0zenice> gamesNmusic: also look into using localStorage if you want to do the check on the client only (a cookie always gets sent to the server, so it's a little bit of a performance killer)
[14:32:33] <gamesNmusic> Oh, nice. I'll check that out too. Thanks fr0zenice :D
[14:32:55] <gotwig> dblosevn: :>

[14:46:55] <StephenS> hold up
[14:48:57] <boytoy> At my photo gallery at http://bit.ly/Y4Z7BZ -- how come jQuery Mobile's data-position="fixed" won't fix position my navigation like in normal browsers?
[14:51:10] <LindsayMac> I've got a work in progress that I wouldn't mind having some design critique / direction regarding the navigation/layout. Anyone interested?
[14:51:17] <StephenS> I have a problem fr0zenice
[14:51:30] <fr0zenice> a shocking revolution
[14:52:38] <StephenS> indeed :D
[14:52:40] <StephenS> Im working on jsfiddle
[14:52:45] <StephenS> thats why it takes so longf ;d
[14:52:56] <fr0zenice> it's ok, I got beer :S
[14:53:48] <jrockjiggz2> Hi, i'm using an older version of bluImp jQuery.fileUpload, I'm having conflict with the input[type=file] button only responding to double-click in IE 8,9, or 10.  I've found reports of it being a CSS issue, but anything I try doesn't make a difference.  does anyone share any experience with this issue?
[14:55:15] <dblosevn> jrockjiggz: pretty sure thats the fileupload im using and not having issues
[14:56:37] <jrockjiggz2> dblosevn: i'm using v. 3.4
[14:56:53] <dblosevn> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload im using 5.21.1
[14:57:21] <jrockjiggz2> really thats good
[14:57:32] <xiphiasx_> hi
[14:57:46] <xiphiasx_> i want to find a <tr> by an id
[14:57:48] <dblosevn> seems to work in ie7+ never tested 6
[14:58:05] <dblosevn> xiphiasx_: $('#yourid')
[14:58:09] <jrockjiggz2> dblosevn: the plugin has been re-written since i've installed it... i'm trying to avoid the headache if I can just fix this one bug (for now that is).. but i might be sol.
[14:58:19] <xiphiasx_> mkay
[14:58:30] <jrockjiggz2> dblosevn: mind if I try your url?
[14:58:33] <dblosevn> i extended the hell out of mine too lol
[14:58:47] <dblosevn> but keyword i extended it, never touched the core
[14:59:26] <jrockjiggz2> dblosevn: does the new one have upload counter limitations?
[14:59:27] <dblosevn> uses a custom button, custom jquery ui progress bar etc
[14:59:34] <jrockjiggz2> wow
[14:59:58] <boytoy> LindsayMac: sure
[15:00:38] <dblosevn> check yo pm
[15:00:47] <jrockjiggz2> dblosevn: if I can just get pass this double-click problem in IE..
[15:00:50] <jrockjiggz2> ty
[15:01:30] <boytoy> LindsayMac: wasnt it u who made that food website a while back?
[15:02:10] <LindsayMac> yes
[15:05:37] <boytoy> LindsayMac: kewl
[15:06:05] <StephenS> I have problem with this fr0zenice http://jsfiddle.net/nWbtz/
[15:06:08] <LindsayMac> yea that thing is/was a nightmare
[15:06:20] <StephenS> When I click on submit button ajax is submitted however all forms are closed
[15:07:11] <boytoy> oh hell yeah i know the feel
[15:07:39] <boytoy> dun worry.. one day u can delete it :P
[15:07:39] <fr0zenice> StephenS: you mean all forms are cleared?
[15:08:02] <boytoy> the site itself wasnt bad though
[15:09:08] <StephenS> fr0zenice, yes
[15:09:25] <fr0zenice> you'll need to selec jQuery on the fiddle at the top left
[15:09:29] <fr0zenice> *select
[15:10:10] <lemodesign> Anyone has a good and easy to understand toggle script for a noobie? It should contain a scroll down to the toggle div and it should self close when getting clicked on and scrolled back to a #id
[15:10:57] <StephenS> k fr0zenice http://jsfiddle.net/nWbtz/1/
[15:11:43] <fr0zenice> yes, is there still a problem now?
[15:13:28] <StephenS> yes
[15:13:32] <StephenS> I added close on failure now http://jsfiddle.net/nWbtz/2/
[15:13:43] <StephenS> just as an example so you can see all forms are closed
[15:14:30] <fr0zenice> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/nWbtz/3/ note the 'self' variable
[15:15:56] <StephenS> ah nice thanks :D
[15:16:06] <fr0zenice> np
[15:16:41] <fr0zenice> you can't use 'this' down there, because that error functions runs in a different context, so you need to store the "parent this" in some var
[15:18:50] <lemodesign> Can someone explain to me why this div isnt self closing: http://fiddle.jshell.net/97FJy/
[15:19:16] <StephenS> ok and also is there anyway to speed this function with ajax?
[15:20:18] <fr0zenice> StephenS: you can hide the form before calling $.ajax, if you mean that (as it would be hidden in any case, whether success or failure)
[15:20:42] <StephenS> I have other form
[15:20:52] <StephenS> that form was just an example and that other form is half hidden half showed :D
[15:22:48] <fr0zenice> I don't know what you mean then, without a code example :P
[15:28:08] <fr0zenice> lemodesign: what do you mean by "this div" and "self closing"?
[15:28:47] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, when you click on the div that toggled it should slide up so it hides itself
[15:30:58] <fr0zenice> you mean .box? you didn't bind any click handler to it
[15:31:51] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, yeps .box should close itself
[15:32:15] <fr0zenice> then bind some click handler or such to it :P
[15:33:43] <mrete> hello
[15:34:03] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, when i bind .box to toggle .box it doenst work or am i doing something wrong :S
[15:34:18] <fr0zenice> code? :)
[15:34:33] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, one sec let me make it
[15:34:51] <boytoy> LindsayMac: so whats up with that nav, u needed comments or what?
[15:35:02] <tw2113> *burp*
[15:35:08] <mrete> hello
[15:35:28] <LindsayMac> hold on
[15:35:32] <mrete> ops, that was one too much :D
[15:37:25] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, like i said i'm a noobie at this but did i do this correctly? (it works but is it the correct way) http://fiddle.jshell.net/rSzhw/
[15:38:00] <tw2113> who's a nooble
[15:38:01] <tw2113> ?
[15:38:08] <lemodesign> me :P
[15:39:33] <fr0zenice> well the basics seem to work, you can always add improvements
[15:40:27] <lemodesign> Thats a polite way of saying this is crappy code :P ? because thats how it looks to me :P
[15:40:44] <fr0zenice> no :>
[15:40:56] <lemodesign> hehe okay :P
[15:41:14] <fr0zenice> you could re-add that scroll thing you had and scroll back to the .open when closing the .box
[15:41:36] <fr0zenice> cursor: pointer; would also be nice
[15:41:38] <lemodesign> i been thinking about doing that im trying to understand how that actualy works
[15:44:27] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, i got it working now but there are more then one of these on my page, it only does the smooth scrolling thing on the first one. Can you point me into the right direction on why that is? http://fiddle.jshell.net/rSzhw/1/
[15:45:52] <fr0zenice> because you use $(".box").offset() but toggle $(this).parent().next(".box")
[15:47:03] <lemodesign> The parent thing is there so it doenst toggle all the div's
[15:47:52] <fr0zenice> right, so just use that to get the offset of the correct element :)
[15:50:50] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, if i delete .offset.top then it doenst scroll anymore or should i not delete it?
[15:52:01] <fr0zenice> use the same selector for toggling and scrolling, maybe putting it into a variable makes it clearer: http://fiddle.jshell.net/rSzhw/2/
[15:54:10] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, i see what you did you basicly did some kinda of reset so it finds the right place to do the scrolling on
[15:56:07] <fr0zenice> dunno what you mean with "reset", but the problem was you were toggling $(this).parent().next(".box") but scrolling to $(".box").offset(), $(".box") != $(this).parent().next(".box") in case of the second gallery item
[15:58:11] <mrete> Does fadeout just change opacity?
[15:58:44] <coldhead> it also does display:none once the opacity animation is complete
[15:59:14] <lemodesign> fr0zenice, you used a "var" is that for any spesific reason or just to make it more easy to understand what is going on?
[15:59:14] <fr0zenice> mrete: it's the first sentence in the docs http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[15:59:38] <fr0zenice> var declares a new variable (basically)
[16:00:16] <lemodesign> but i can only use this within the function right its not "global" ?
[16:00:36] <fr0zenice> yes, it would be gobal without the var
[16:00:41] <fr0zenice> but that's bad.
[16:01:06] <lemodesign> bad practice to do a global one?
[16:02:15] <fr0zenice> hmm, not exactly; one problem is it 'leaks' into the global space if you don't use var; and you'Ll have a nightmare debugging where those global variables come from (in more complex obects)
[16:02:49] <lemodesign> yea that makes sens you make it more difficult for yourself basicly
[16:03:06] <fr0zenice> the other one is that it's only relevant in this specific context, if I click another gallery item it would change (a global var could only be useful to track where the user clicked last)
[16:03:55] <lemodesign> could you use it in order to make sure only one div on the page is toggled at any given time?
[16:04:25] <fr0zenice> you could implement some kind of lock, yes
[16:04:50] <fr0zenice> if you really want, but also think about if you really want to restrict it
[16:06:00] <lemodesign> well there gonna be 3/4 of those galleries on the page and maybe it would be handy if you have one open and you wanna open another one that it would close the old one
[16:07:20] <stefanek> hi

[17:16:11] <basiclaser> Can JavaScript really solve all of my problems?
[17:18:26] <jrajav> The answer lies inside you.
[17:43:25] <scar> basiclaser, with node.js maybe
[18:51:12] <joikus_> hmm
[18:52:38] <joikus_> <div class="dropdown"> hello <ul>...</ul></div>   -- how can I replace the text "hello" with this setup?
[18:55:10] <tw2113> easy copout would be wrap it in a span
[18:55:26] <joikus_> ya I can't though
[18:55:47] <joikus_> because this dropdown class is from zurb framework, and that span ruins the click trigger
[18:55:47] <joikus_> :/
[18:56:06] <joikus_> zurb 3
[18:56:11] <joikus_> zurb 4 solves this
[18:58:11] <joikus_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4106809/in-jquery-how-can-i-change-an-elements-text-without-changing-its-child-elements/4106957#4106957

[18:59:03] <joikus_> nodeType nice
[19:24:45] <CrazyZurfer> hi guys
[19:25:04] <CrazyZurfer> I don't know why this does not work! :( --> http://jsfiddle.net/YDVLT/
[19:30:56] <sahbeewah> CrazyZurfer, the function doesn't exist at the point when the html gets processed
[19:31:16] <sahbeewah> also, you shouldn't use those inline event attributes
[19:31:22] <sahbeewah> http://jsfiddle.net/YDVLT/1/
[19:32:33] <CrazyZurfer> sahbeewah: Rally Thanks!, Ok, I will avoid using the inline events ;)
[19:34:37] <someprimetime_> where the homies @
[20:27:43] <Guddu> I have a customer that has all their PCs on Either Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP and they run either IE7 or IE6 . . . I have to develop a Web App for this client. I was wondering that for the menu, what shalll i use? I think JS or JQuery menu will not fare well. Is there something else, more basic that is guaranteed to work that i can use? Please guide.
[20:33:19] <someprimetime_> You should just not help them until they start supporting at MOST IE8
[20:33:30] <someprimetime_> and what kind of "menu"?
[20:33:36] <someprimetime_> that's a pretty objective feature
[20:34:26] <systemfault> Guddu: If you can… flee
[20:37:20] <tw2113> should have flee'd a week ago
[20:53:57] <veQue> i'm out of cocacola
[20:54:04] <veQue> bah!
[20:54:29] <tw2113> zomg
[20:54:34] <tw2113> end of zee vorld!
[20:54:41] <someprimetime_> Knock knock
[20:54:46] <tw2113> who's where
[20:55:45] <veQue> where's there?
[20:56:05] <tw2113> what's what
[20:56:11] <tw2113> </philosophy>
[20:56:16] <someprimetime_> Java.
[20:56:29] <someprimetime_> Was that a long enough pause?
[20:56:38] <veQue> doing right this am i?
[20:58:19] <tw2113> compile error someprimetime_
[20:58:35] <someprimetime_> tw2113: What line? I can't scrollup since my scrollback only goes back to 10,000
[20:58:53] <tw2113> sometime after "knock knock"
[20:59:06] <someprimetime_> Quick restart tomcat. Oh tomcat is already down?
[20:59:29] <someprimetime_> I'm installing octopress right now
[20:59:36] <tw2113> look out!
[20:59:40] <someprimetime_> Anyone have anything to say about it?
[20:59:46] <someprimetime_> You wanna say it to my face?
[21:00:03] <someprimetime_> Think I'll go with the rsync option here
[21:00:16] <someprimetime_> Don't want people stealing my top secret blog posts using github pages
[21:01:10] <veQue> no you dont
[21:01:23] <veQue> got a link?
[21:01:32] <tw2113> why would we want to steal cat pics
[21:01:35] <someprimetime_> I haven't written them yet
[21:01:44] <someprimetime_> They are in my mind. I've got this idea. Want to go into business together?
[21:01:46] <veQue> even better
[21:01:52] <someprimetime_> I'll take 70% of the stake
[21:01:55] <veQue> yes
[21:02:04] <veQue> sure
[21:02:06] <someprimetime_> You can work long hours and get the 20% (the 10% goes into a trust fund for my kids)
[21:02:19] <veQue> you can have 70% of a steak
[21:02:27] <someprimetime_> It'll be the next youtube mashed with snapchat. You upload videos and they disappear after 30 minutes
[21:02:36] <someprimetime_> It'll revolutionize the world
[21:02:45] <someprimetime_> I'd love 70% of a steak right now
[21:02:55] <someprimetime_> I'd actually prefer 100% of one
[21:03:09] <someprimetime_> Unless it has 30% fat, then I'll go with your proposal
[21:03:52] <veQue> fatcow acting weird on me
[21:04:04] <veQue> what serverhost do you use?
[21:04:09] <Guddu> Is JQuery supported on IE6 and IE7?
[21:04:35] <someprimetime_> Not the latest jQuery
[21:04:36] <veQue> you have to worry about ie6?
[21:04:42] <someprimetime_> But seriously that sucks
[21:05:03] <someprimetime_> Are you developing an HTML5 version of cruisn' USA for the North Korean government?
[21:05:20] <someprimetime_> brb folks gonna grab an energy drink at the store
[21:05:22] <Guddu> veQue, Yes... IE6....Cuz most Client systems still use that browser. or IE7
[21:05:38] <veQue> Guddu: when will they learn?
[21:05:39] <Guddu> The Client has not updated
[21:05:40] <someprimetime_> Guddu: out of curiosity what country?
[21:05:42] <someprimetime_> Russia?
[21:05:53] <Guddu> someprimetime_, Russia is a bad guess :)
[21:05:58] <veQue> sorry guddu wish i could give you a serious answer i ignore ie completly
[21:06:00] <someprimetime_> Guddu: Korea
[21:06:03] <someprimetime_> (south)
[21:06:03] <Guddu> Russians are rather smart i would say LOL
[21:06:12] <someprimetime_> Thailand?
[21:06:12] <Guddu> Well The problem is that
[21:06:25] <someprimetime_> little help?
[21:06:39] <someprimetime_> Alright this time leaving though bbiaf
[21:06:56] <Guddu> The client wants to update their system. But they are running another application which prohibits and updates to the servers. Or else that app may not function correctly.
[21:07:05] <Guddu> This is in Brazil
[21:07:29] <Guddu> Nothing to do with the country as such :P
[21:08:38] <Guddu> But JQuery 1.X should be good to use right?
[21:09:04] <priyanshu> want help regarding sliderkit please help me out guys
[21:09:15] <systemfault> Guddu: Run away while you can
[21:09:32] <Guddu> systemfault,  What?
[21:09:43] <systemfault> Find another contract…
[21:10:29] <fat> my clear button isn't working. please help http://jsfiddle.net/aMmVQ/85/
[21:10:33] <Guddu> systemfault, :-) I thought u were coming after me for asking that question :-) LOL
[21:10:55] <priyanshu> @fat you have any idea of slidekit jquery slider
[21:11:09] <systemfault> fat: You might have more chance on #Javascript
[21:11:11] <carpii> Guddu, jQuery is only 1.9.1, so all jQuery are 1.x :)
[21:11:40] <carpii> i expect most features will work on IE6
[21:11:44] <Guddu> carpii, I thought so until i hit http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[21:11:44] <dcherman> carpii: false - 2.0 is currently in beta
[21:11:53] <Guddu> They mentioned 2.X also
[21:11:57] <carpii> oh sorry, my bad
[21:12:04] <Guddu> Thanks. I will do a quick test on IE6
[21:12:08] <veQue> someone hacked my htacess file
[21:12:12] <greg5green> Guddu, 1.9 is fine (they are maintaining api parity with 2.0 for the interest of old IE compatibility)
[21:12:16] <priyanshu> @carpii help me out
[21:12:23] <carpii> huh? why me
[21:12:24] <veQue> i think it was a wordpress file
[21:12:35] <veQue> plugin must've been weak
[21:12:57] <veQue> so i'm just gonna delete all the things i can
[21:13:07] <priyanshu> you have any idea regarding sliderkit
[21:13:12] <veQue> i think i can leave my password alone
[21:13:16] <carpii> priy, nope
[21:13:44] <priyanshu> the jquery version is creating problems
[21:14:01] <carpii> priy, but just ask your question, saying 'i have a prob' doesnt help anyone
[21:14:29] <priyanshu> using jquery libraray 1.9.0 which is altogether different from my wordpress jquery 1.8
[21:14:36] <priyanshu> 1.8.3
[21:14:43] <carpii> and what problem is it causing exactly?
[21:15:14] <priyanshu> see when i saw noth the jquery libs 1.9.0 is quite big as compared to 1.8.3
[21:15:44] <priyanshu> i want to this kits compatibilty with 1.8.3
[21:15:48] <carpii> 32k ?
[21:15:49] <fat> systemfault: Cannot send to channel: ##javascript
[21:16:21] <systemfault> fat: You need to register your nickname probably.
[21:16:21] <carpii> priy, jQuery is mostly backwards compatible. you need to be more specific
[21:16:25] <carpii> about what 'isnt working'
[21:16:33] <fat> systemfault: how do i do that
[21:16:49] <tw2113> ?g nickserv register
[21:16:49] <b-ot> tw2113: Register with NickServ → http://oreilly.com/pub/h/1940
[21:16:51] <bot-t> tw2113, Register with NickServ - http://oreilly.com/pub/h/1940
[21:17:03] <tw2113> valid link
[21:17:11] <priyanshu> when i chage the jquery lib version to 1.8.3 than my slides not working i mean nothing is coming up
[21:17:25] <carpii> priy, check console, see if there are any errors
[21:17:35] <dcherman> 1.9.0 isn't "quite big" compared to 1.8.3 fyi, it's smaller.  http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[21:17:51] <fat> systemfault: fat is already registered.
[21:17:56] <priyanshu> 1.9.0 aslo inclide some sizzle.js init
[21:18:01] <systemfault> fat: Then change your nick :(
[21:18:05] <priyanshu> but 1.8.3 isint
[21:18:17] <fat> hello
[21:18:43] <fat> fattest ##javascript Cannot change nickname while banned on channel
[21:18:53] <fat> why am i banned.?
[21:19:11] <systemfault> You're not banned, the network messages can be stupidly misleading
[21:19:42] <someprimetime_> I need to stop buying scratch off lottery tickets
[21:19:43] <systemfault> Leave the ##javascript channel, change/register your nick then you can rejoin it.
[21:19:47] <someprimetime_> I always bash on people who do it, but then I do it
[21:19:59] <someprimetime_> It doesn't help that I keep winning tickets. It's an endless cycle.
[21:21:13] <priyanshu> carpii, consoloe is not showing any errors
[21:21:53] <carpii> priy, import the jQuery migrate plugin, maybe your plugin is using some really old API's which are now deprecated
[21:21:54] <carpii> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/31/jquery-migrate-1-1-0-released/
[21:22:09] <priyanshu> perfectly workin fine with the jquery version 1.9.0 and when i chaged it t o1.8.3 than nothing happens
[21:22:41] <tw2113> it's self promotion, but maybe try this out? since you're getting it to work with 1.9
[21:22:43] <tw2113> http://michaelbox.net/2013/01/load-newer-version-of-jquery-until-wordpress-core-has-that-version/
[21:23:16] <tw2113> could probably amend to 1.9.0 or lower
[21:25:15] <priyanshu> carpii, but cant it possible with t the version 1.8.3?
[21:25:27] <carpii> i dont udnerstand
[21:25:51] <tw2113> until you provide a link for others to see, we can't tell you what it is
[21:26:06] <tw2113> all we're hearing is 'works in 1.9.0, not in 1.8.3. no errors"
[21:26:25] <priyanshu> see my wordpress jquery lib is 1.8.3 and as per the guide lines i cant use any other jquery other than that so i have left no choice
[21:26:38] <tw2113> why can't you?
[21:26:49] <priyanshu> to use lib version 1.8.3 instead 1.9.0
[21:26:51] <tw2113> some class assignment that says "WP core version only" ?
[21:27:06] <tw2113> ah, it explicitly says to use 1.8.3.?
[21:27:30] <tw2113> how about providing a link to the page in question
[21:29:35] <priyanshu> why sliderkit not working with jquery lib version 1.8.3
[21:29:42] * carpii snaps pencil
[21:30:05] <carpii> priy, dont be *that guy* :(
[21:30:30] <tw2113> how are we supposed to know?
[21:33:33] <priyanshu> carpii u thr
[21:33:45] <carpii> ?
[21:34:01] <priyanshu> hey i am very much stucked wht to do
[21:34:17] <carpii> well youve a few choices
[21:34:42] <carpii> 1) dont upgrade jQuery  2) Learn how to debug jQuery and fix it yourself   3) Hire someone to magically fix your problems
[21:34:43] <priyanshu> what r those carpii
[21:35:05] <priyanshu> hahah
[21:35:24] <carpii> :/
[21:36:17] <priyanshu> carpii, you go the problem i am dealing with
[21:36:51] <carpii> nope
[21:36:56] <carpii> all i know is something isnt working for you
[21:37:02] <carpii> as weve said a few times now
[21:37:18] <priyanshu> ohoooo jquery version creating problems
[21:37:27] <priyanshu> sliderkit is not working on version 1.8.3
[21:37:32] <carpii> oh man
[21:37:52] <carpii> so stick with 1.8.3
[21:38:16] <tw2113_too> that's where it's not working though
[21:38:19] <carpii> if you dont know how to fix problems like this
[21:38:23] <carpii> you shouldnt be running a website
[21:38:24] <tw2113_too> we get it priyanshu, it's not working
[21:38:28] <tw2113_too> you're not helping us debug
[21:38:43] <tw2113_too> you're not providing a link so we can see and maybe find errors you're missing
[21:39:18] <priyanshu> wait give em a min i wil do that
[21:40:23] <carpii> you know hes going to paste 3000 lines of code right ? :p
[21:43:50] <tw2113> much better
[22:01:16] <tw2113> apparently i offended
[22:01:16] <tw2113> yo rodrigovieira
[22:01:16] <greg5green> i love the internet and all of its users
[22:01:16] <greg5green> ...
[22:01:17] <greg5green> just keep repeating that over and over
[22:01:17] <tw2113> i love whiskey i love whiskey i love whiskey i love whiskey
[22:01:18] <rodrigovieira> I love whiskey too
[22:01:18] <greg5green> i dont
[22:01:18] <greg5green> im a gin guy
[22:01:18] <rodrigovieira> @greg5green I love the interwebs too
[22:01:18] <rodrigovieira> sayin' interwebs was quite cool years ago, hope that still holds
[22:24:58] <tw2113> carpii, were you actually looking forward to helping with that slider issue like i was?
[22:25:24] <carpii> heh, well if hed managed to explain it properly, or show some code, yea :)
[22:25:33] <carpii> but i doubt he was ever gonna be able to do that :/
[22:25:40] <tw2113> same here
[22:25:46] <tw2113> i take a little bit of pleasure in helping when i can
[22:25:51] <carpii> same :)
[22:26:00] <tw2113> why else would i hang out in a support channel
[23:09:15] <Stampy> is there a way to define .beforeSend on a .getJSON call, or do I need to do the full .ajax?  I'm using 1.9.0
[23:11:44] <greg5green> you'll need to use .ajax()
[23:12:40] <JBlitzen\AG> Any of you guys know of a good example or tutorial or something on using handles with resizable?  I want to add an icon or something for the user to click on to resize, and I can't get any test case working or find any example.
[23:19:27] <JBlitzen\AG> Man, either I suck at bing or bing sucks at searching
[23:30:33] <JBlitzen\AG> Yeah, that's not working for shit
[23:33:39] <JBlitzen\AG> Hmm, testing it on a simple "o" character, but ui-resizable sets font-size to 0.1px
[23:33:43] <JBlitzen\AG> Maybe it only works with images
[23:37:13] <JBlitzen\AG> AH
[23:37:18] <JBlitzen\AG> That did the trick, works perfectly
[23:37:27] <JBlitzen\AG> Thanks for letting me talk through it
[23:37:41] <JBlitzen\AG> I always say, when no other help is available, read the source code
[23:37:59] <JBlitzen\AG> No idea why they'd set font-size to 0.2px or whatever but that was all I needed to know
[23:41:31] <greg5green> :)
[23:41:41] <JBlitzen\AG> :]
[23:41:47] <greg5green> the project im working on at work uses dojo, sometimes the source code is all that helps
[23:41:53] <JBlitzen\AG> Sore throat so Saturday's ruined, this is all I have hehe
[23:42:01] <greg5green> amazing how much is documented in the source code, but not in their online web docs
[23:42:05] <JBlitzen\AG> nod
[23:42:31] <JBlitzen\AG> That's one nice thing about these open source tools.  They're often completely fucked up, but at least you can usually see where.
[23:43:14] <JBlitzen\AG> Coming from the win32 and later .net worlds, there were damned few bugs or glitches to begin with.  I think I saw one inexplicable behavior in like five years
[23:43:32] <JBlitzen\AG> But everything has tradeoffs
[23:43:44] <JBlitzen\AG> Okay, so this works well now.  Off for cookies and Big Bang Theory DVD's
[23:46:02] <varnie> why does the following alert "true": alert($('<input checked="false" type="checkbox" name="test_me" >').prop('checked')); //?
[23:46:46] <JBlitzen\AG> I don't think checked is a boolean for checkboxes
[23:47:00] <JBlitzen\AG> I think it's like selected for select options, if it's present at all it counts as a yes
[23:47:23] <varnie> from here: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-checked
[23:47:31] <varnie> "When the type attribute has the value "radio" or "checkbox", this boolean attribute specifies that the button is on. User agents must ignore this attribute for other control types."
[23:47:48] <varnie> it is stated that it is a boolean attribute
[23:48:00] <varnie> I am confused...
[23:48:18] <JBlitzen\AG> Indulge me
[23:50:03] <carpii> its a property rather than an attribute
[23:50:33] <carpii> so for it to be checked, the markup is <input type='checkbox" CHECKED>
[23:50:45] <carpii> boolean meaning its either present or it isnt
[23:51:14] <greg5green> weve been talking about this in ##javascript for a while
[23:51:32] <carpii> what was the conclusion?
[23:51:52] <greg5green> there was no conclusion
[23:51:53] <varnie> okay, thanks
[23:51:57] <greg5green> i think thats why he posted here
[23:51:58] <carpii> heh ok
[23:52:16] <greg5green> i was trying to say that from what i had read, it was supposed to be checked="true" or checked="false"
[23:52:21] <carpii> i think the confusion comes from XHTML allowing checked="checked"
[23:52:29] <carpii> but im not sure HTML 4.01 or HTML 5 does
[23:52:30] <greg5green> chrome and FF treated it as checked existing or not
[23:52:39] <greg5green> whereas IE was looking for what the value of the attribute was
[23:53:06] <carpii> and im not sure checked="true" is valid in any markup
[23:53:22] <JBlitzen\AG> Don't expect consistency from a technology developed by committee
[23:53:27] <carpii> yup
[23:53:41] <carpii> least of all one which MS has any say in
[23:54:00] <JBlitzen\AG> Shrug, I think they were the ones who pushed xhtml which at least struggles for better consistency
[23:54:11] <JBlitzen\AG> But I don't really know or much care
[23:56:28] <greg5green> carpii, you are right that checked=true does not validate
