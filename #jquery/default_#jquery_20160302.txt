[03:11:44] <kevireilly> Bogdaniel: textures['texture/wood-' + c + '.jpg'] doesn't exist -- may want to make sure it does before trying to clone it

[05:56:37] <HowardwLo> what triggers a ajax .fail()? status code?
[06:30:39] <xec> HowardwLo: yes. any status code starting with 4xx or 5xx iirc
[06:33:58] <xec> HowardwLo: of course, also any errors that prevents you from connecting to the server in the first place
[07:25:06] <Duikb00t> o/ !
[07:32:06] <EffectsForShopz> halo
[07:32:21] <EffectsForShopz> where is beter to put script tag
[07:32:26] <EffectsForShopz> in head or body
[07:32:34] <xec> define "beter"
[07:32:52] <xec> put it at end of body to make sure it's loaded last
[07:34:01] <tilerendering> i make an ajax call: promiseOne = $.ajax({ url: '../test.html' });    —> I define: promiseOne.done(function () {console.log('PromiseOne Done');}); —> how do I access/refer to the result of the ajax call (the actual response body) when defining promiseOne.done ?
[07:35:10] <shoky> tilerendering: .done(function(data) { ... })
[07:36:56] <tilerendering> shoky: “data” is a reserved word symbolizing the response body ?
[07:37:19] <shoky> tilerendering: no, you can call it anything you want. it's just an argument to the callback function
[07:37:42] <shoky> tilerendering: $.ajax will call the callback and pass it the response data as first argument
[07:37:49] <tilerendering> ahhhhh
[07:37:51] <tilerendering> thanks :)
[07:57:31] <Duikb00t> yo
[08:16:16] <jose_____> howdy
[08:16:29] <jose_____> is there a difference between insertafter and append?
[08:17:27] <Duikb00t> jose_____:  http://jsfiddle.net/designaroni/b33tL7hu/
[08:17:45] <Duikb00t> The difference is that append() adds the new nodes to the selected nodes from the selector, meaning inserting it INTO the matched element.
[08:17:53] <Duikb00t> .appendTo is like getting onto the last car of a train.
[08:17:53] <Duikb00t> .insertAfter is like running down the tracks as it pulls away.
[08:18:36] <jose_____> I see
[08:19:09] <jose_____> if i can use both, is it better to use one or the other
[08:19:35] <Duikb00t> No idea :)
[08:20:11] <jose_____> okay thank you for your assitance
[08:20:45] <shoky> jose_____: whatever makes the code simpler and more readable
[08:21:09] <Duikb00t> Someone able to look in private to a live site which has some jquery bug?

[08:27:46] <steven> morning folks, is there a way to force jquery selector to return a collection even if there was only one element found?
[08:29:26] <decx> it already does that
[08:29:33] <decx> it's a collection of one
[08:39:56] <steven> hm.. doesnt look like it but let me double check
[08:49:11] <tilerendering> hey buddies, care to help me with this one ? http://pastebin.com/MssYgYum
[08:49:14] <wodim> hello, why can't I do $(".multi .section input")[0].val() ?
[08:50:06] <decx> [0] takes the underlying native element
[08:50:13] <decx> which doesnt have a val() method
[08:50:19] <decx> but instead a .value property
[08:50:48] <decx> use .get(0) if you want the jquery collections element at that index with all its methods or just use the native
[08:50:56] <decx> ... .eq()
[08:51:03] <decx> .get() is the same as []
[08:51:54] <wodim> ah, right
[08:51:56] <wodim> I tried get() too
[08:51:58] <wodim> now I see
[08:53:20] <wodim> thanks
[09:28:49] <sigdk> I 've a question... but first I need to do another question: why doesn't the json object get printed ? I'm trying to create a simple ajax mockup: https://jsfiddle.net/dx5ncenw/1/
[09:35:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dx5ncenw/2/
[09:37:04] <sigdk> taplar, why the method was a problem ?
[09:37:14] <taplar> dunno
[09:37:28] <taplar> what was your second question?
[09:37:35] <taplar> and fwiw you should avoid async false
[09:37:53] <sigdk> taplar, yes. I 've heard that here
[09:37:58] <sigdk> hold on, do another fiddle...
[09:42:14] <sigdk> taplar, so, here 's a simplification of my code: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/50/
[09:42:27] <_eddy> hi i want to add a div after the body tag $( "body" ).append( '<div class="scroll_content">' ); but this didnt add it after the body tag
[09:42:44] <sigdk> Currently, the ajax query is executed on every page refresh, but I'd like to execute it only whenever the user presses the button
[09:43:02] <_eddy> also it added the div closure </div> which i do not want
[09:43:16] <sigdk> but the problem is that it doesn't work if I put the $.ajax inside 	$('#modalTriggerId').click(function() {...
[09:43:30] <shoky> _eddy you shouldn't have anything after the body tag
[09:43:46] <_eddy> shoky: why?
[09:44:11] <_eddy> <body><div class="scroll_content">
[09:44:12] <decx> ever had an out of body experience?
[09:44:29] <decx> well that's not after the body
[09:44:34] <shoky> _eddy:  that's inside the body tag, not after it.  inside means between <body>  and </body>
[09:44:51] <decx> so you want scroll_content between body and /body i assume?
[09:44:52] <shoky> and .append() will put it inside as last
[09:45:14] <_eddy> decx:  ye
[09:45:29] <decx> $('body').wrapInner('<div class="">')
[09:45:35] <shoky> _eddy:  and you cant add partial html tags to the DOM, cant add a <div> without a </div>
[09:45:39] <_eddy> i want to add scroll_content and wrap everything inside of it
[09:45:43] <shoky> _eddy: you must add complete elements
[09:46:14] <shoky> var div = $('<div>');  div.append(whatever);  $('body').append(div);
[09:46:46] <decx> wrapInner
[09:46:50] <shoky> or what decx said if you wanna wrap everything that's already inside <body>
[09:50:48] <taplar> sigdk: it would need to go inside that click handler.  what does not work when you do that?
[09:51:03] <_eddy> decx: an issue, because my page is a one page web app. Other jquery calls are adding things into the body tag
[09:51:37] <taplar> _eddy: SPA
[09:51:43] <_eddy> ?
[09:51:49] <taplar> single page application
[09:51:53] <taplar> is the common term
[09:52:06] <_eddy> long story short.
[09:52:20] <decx> so?
[09:52:25] <decx> add stuff not to body
[09:52:27] <decx> solved
[09:52:30] <decx> money plz
[09:52:34] <_eddy> <div class="scroll_content"> has been added after the body tag BUT doesnt close before the end body tag
[09:52:52] <taplar> anything appended to another element will be auto closed
[09:52:53] <decx> that's broken html
[09:52:59] <decx> browser wont care
[09:53:00] <shoky> the dom doesn't contain html
[09:53:01] <taplar> your not appending text, your appending dom nodes
[09:53:12] <shoky> it just has nodes, with child nodes
[09:53:13] <_eddy> <body><div class="scroll_content"> some stuff with more divs here </div></body>
[09:56:09] <_eddy> shoky: i have tried just added the div manually to the html page
[09:56:43] <taplar> i'm not at all clear what the question is
[09:56:44] <_eddy> but another div which gets added by jquery just moves it down away from the body tag
[09:58:02] <taplar> 'away from the body tag'.  so another div gets inserted before that div?
[09:58:05] <shoky> _eddy: donno what you mean but if you have other code that's doing things you don't want.. remove that code :)
[09:58:21] <decx> on that note, write your markup how you want it from the start
[09:58:28] <taplar> ^^^
[09:58:37] <_eddy> shoky: okay will show you some code
[09:59:21] <shoky> what did i do :S
[09:59:38] <taplar> who knows
[09:59:43] <taplar> there is no question, lol
[10:00:08] <_eddy> shoky: http://kopy.io/7GQKY line 2 and 25
[10:00:23] <shoky> ugh
[10:00:34] <shoky> _eddy: no idea what you're asking. don't want to look at your php code. thanks :)
[10:00:40] <_eddy> after PHP executes and gets all the contents
[10:01:23] <_eddy> it adds <div class="tip"></div> after the body
[10:01:44] <decx> just the tip?
[10:01:57] <_eddy> making it like this http://kopy.io/fbuVj
[10:02:23] <_eddy> i have search all 9089 files and i cant find where the hell "tip" is
[10:03:37] <shoky> try adding some more files.
[10:03:58] <_eddy> i think the best bet is to remove tip using jquery
[10:05:11] <_eddy> found it
[10:05:34] <_eddy> it was in tip.js
[10:05:39] <_eddy> funny enough
[10:12:42] <_eddy> has anyone ever used this library before? https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll
[10:13:07] <graphettion> I want a regular expression to do a specific thing. I want it to replace some characters and the rest of characters fill with an empty space. - https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/76pg75dw/
[10:13:14] <graphettion> Anyone know how I can achieve this?
[10:15:25] <sigdk> taplar, I'm not sure if this is the problem... I simplified further. Seems that what I'm trying to add to the dropdown menu is null: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/52/  any idea why is this problematic ?
[10:15:51] <sigdk> taplar, ignore my question...
[10:16:00] <taplar> ?
[10:29:54] <wodim> does jQuery.each() inherit the variables from the scope it's executed in?
[10:30:11] <slax0r> tias?
[10:30:17] <taplar> it iterates over the internal collection
[10:30:55] <wodim> no way to pass it variables for them to be available inside the callback function?
[10:31:08] <taplar> sure, normal scope rules apply
[10:31:17] <taplar> if your asking if variables in scope can be used inside the each
[10:32:03] <wodim> well it's a callback
[10:32:17] <wodim> idk much about js
[10:32:19] <taplar> got a fiddle of what your trying?
[10:32:23] <wodim> it would make sense it would inherit no local variables
[10:32:24] <wodim> nay
[10:32:45] <wodim> var lol = "potato"; kek.each(function() { ; });
[10:32:51] <wodim> I want to access lol inside the callback
[10:32:55] <taplar> sure, lol would be available in there
[10:32:57] <wodim> nice
[10:32:59] <wodim> thanks
[10:34:01] <wodim> but if I have an each inside an each, I guess "this" is rewritten
[10:34:04] <wodim> so I should make a copy of it
[10:34:05] <wodim> ?
[10:34:07] <taplar> yes
[10:34:10] <wodim> right
[10:34:19] <taplar> or you can use the element passed to the each
[10:34:22] <decx> it's a russian doll situation
[10:34:40] <taplar> i believe the syntax available is each(function(index, element){...
[10:37:15] <_eddy> i want to trigger the search button when someone press enter after finish typing what the have to do in the input field. https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/
[10:38:01] <taplar> capture the keydown for the input and check if it is the enter key
[10:38:19] <taplar> wait
[10:38:25] <taplar> it's already a submit button
[10:38:44] <taplar> why do you want to do that?  it will already submit
[10:39:11] <_eddy> taplar: for mobile users
[10:39:46] <_eddy> after finish typing on my phone and press enter it doesnt trigger the submiy
[10:39:59] <taplar> weird
[10:40:02] <taplar> and it's in a form?
[10:40:03] <_eddy> submit i have to come out and press the submit key
[10:40:08] <_eddy> taplar: nope
[10:40:27] <taplar> oh, so your doing some kinda ajax thing?
[10:40:35] <_eddy> yep
[10:40:38] <taplar> ok
[10:41:03] <taplar> well, capture keydown on the input field, check if it is enter and if so, click the button, or execute the same function the button click will perform
[10:41:39] <taplar> enter would be if (e.which === 13)
[10:42:37] <_eddy> taplar: i had a go at that https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/1/
[10:42:58] <_eddy> but
[10:43:38] <taplar> mid_button_search is a div
[10:43:42] <taplar> and your not in a form
[10:43:46] <taplar> so submit() is weird
[10:44:13] <_eddy> https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/2/
[10:44:26] <_eddy> so submit wouldnt work because it aint a form?
[10:44:37] <taplar> i don't see how it would
[10:44:42] <taplar> your wanting to click the button
[10:45:06] <taplar> and address is the input
[10:45:10] <taplar> there is no nested input element
[10:46:03] <_eddy> sorry my bad on that
[10:46:23] <taplar> you also are mixing inline bindings with js bindings.  you really should be doing all your bindings in js
[10:49:12] <_eddy> taplar: please explain abit on that
[10:49:23] <_eddy> i aint a front end guy but back end
[10:49:28] <taplar> ok, so there are a few reasons for that
[10:49:37] <taplar> first being your mixing your logic in with your markup
[10:50:01] <taplar> so your not separating your concerns which spreads your logic out and makes it harder to manage
[10:50:15] <taplar> second, jquery doesn't know anything about inline bindings
[10:50:25] <taplar> so it's more difficult for it to manage them
[10:50:34] <taplar> third, inline bindings can't be delegates
[10:50:49] <taplar> which are usually a good idea for bindings
[10:51:06] <taplar> i've also read something about inline bindings being limited in that you can only have one
[10:51:53] <taplar> so it's just more manageable and less limiting to bind in your js rather than in your markup
[10:54:03] <_eddy> okay thanks taplar
[10:54:19] <_eddy> will remember that for future references
[10:56:09] <wodim> taplar: if I modified lol inside the callback, the modifications are also available to the rest of th efunction?
[10:56:27] <taplar_afk1sec> yes
[10:56:36] <wodim> aight
[10:56:54] <taplar_afk1sec> also easy enough to test, ;)
[10:59:05] <sigdk> taplar_afk1sec, I pushed the request inside the click handler as you suggested: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/57/  It does work fine here, but not on my program. Any idea why ?
[10:59:55] <sigdk> by "it doesn't work" I mean that the dropdown does not get populated. I get no errors however
[11:00:02] <_eddy> https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/3/ https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/3/
[11:00:09] <_eddy> https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/3/ taplar_afk1sec
[11:03:32] <taplar> sigdk: check your console's network tab and see if the request is returning the correct response.  you can also add some console.log() in your success handler to look at pieces of data
[11:06:40] <sigdk> taplar, can I do the request somewhere in .leanModal({ ...  ?
[11:07:13] <sigdk> taplar, the request doesn't take place, I checked the server side
[11:09:43] <taplar> _eddy: https://jsfiddle.net/s864s7a1/4/
[11:09:56] <taplar> sigdk: does your browser show that it is taking place?
[11:14:09] <_eddy> taplar: thanks am abut more clear now so instead of triggering the button i need to call the Main.SaveWhereAmI() function
[11:15:00] <sigdk> taplar, how do I check that ? network tab ?
[11:15:53] <taplar> sigdk: yeah, right click on your page and choose to inspect element, which will open your dev tools.  in there you should see a tab labeled network
[11:16:12] <taplar> it will log all network requests made to display your page and any ajax requests your page makes
[11:16:54] <taplar> _eddy: yeah that would be preferred instead of delegating the logic to the submit button
[11:17:41] <sigdk> taplar, hmm, yes that appears there
[11:18:06] <taplar> sigdk: ok, click on your request and you can see the details of it such as the endpoint and the parameters being sent
[11:19:19] <_eddy> taplar: line 11 - 15 in your linl what are you trying to check?
[11:20:01] <taplar> that's the onkeyup you had inlined or something
[11:20:37] <_eddy> onkeyup="Forms.CheckTextInput('whereami',this);GoogleMap.UpdateUserPosition(this)"
[11:20:49] <_eddy> is on the input field
[11:20:50] <taplar> yep, so i changed that to be a js binding instead of an inline
[11:21:28] <sigdk> taplar, ok, I don't know if I did something wrong before or it's some kind of "Heisenbug" but could it be the case that the click handler gets executed *after* the form and the dropdown menu is rendered ?
[11:21:44] <_eddy> what happens they is when the user types their postcode or zipcode it goes off and find the address using google API
[11:22:13] <taplar> that's fine.  it should function the same.  just binding in the js instead of inline now
[11:23:29] <taplar> sigdk: what do you mean?  does the render happen with the leanModal?
[11:24:11] <taplar> the click handler is only going to execute when the user clicks it
[11:25:17] <sigdk> taplar, yes but what if the leanModal gets rendered (the form that appears with it as well) and then... the query takes place. Will I see the changes on the dropdown ?
[11:25:30] <islalobo> I had to update the data I'm returning in an ajax call to work with the way we're planning on caching it. Now I'm stuck because I'm not certain how to iterate through this array: http://kopy.io/P6LQC
[11:25:38] <sigdk> I've sometimes a problem understanding when happens what with jquery
[11:26:45] <taplar> sigdk: the ajax success is changing elements on the page, at the point that it completes.  you should see the changes provided you are targeting the correct elements to change
[11:27:00] <iDentity1337> Every single scroll-bar plugin I've tried, none of them works in a div where I need it. In #sidebar-wrapper they work normally, but in #sidebar-friends none of them work. Is this CSS related?
[11:27:27] <iDentity1337> I've came here because I google 'jQuery scrollbars' XD
[11:28:16] <taplar> islalobo: i *think* each() will work with objects (which is what your returning, not an array), and will give it a (key, value) parameters
[11:31:36] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/H27KHfBK
[11:31:39] <iDentity1337> nvm
[11:31:40] <iDentity1337> wrong channel

[11:36:56] <tilerendering>  I m stuck with this question: http://pastebin.com/qSFDZeq9
[11:38:36] <taplar> uh, loginsync is returning a promise
[11:38:39] <rudy1976s> Hello is there way with bootstrap 3 to avoid that modals will put all  the code to the bottom of the page, breaking forms ?
[11:38:43] <taplar> it isn't synchronous, :)
[11:39:21] <taplar> rudy1976s: maybe as #bootstrap ?
[11:39:23] <taplar> *ask
[11:39:51] <rudy1976s> argh sorry this is jquery only room sorry
[11:40:41] <Hollusionist>  how do i get .pushStates first parameter within the popstate event?
[11:43:21] <tilerendering> taplar: hm, I m new to this, read the docs, but somehow I still cant figure out what´s wrong with it so that i can proceed
[11:43:35] <tilerendering> taplar: and I know it isnt synchrnous
[11:43:39] <taplar> your trying to do synchronous processing with an asynchronous object
[11:43:43] <tilerendering> however, the caller should advance in sync way
[11:44:07] <tilerendering> taplar: the subsequent .then only gets executed after the first one completed
[11:44:13] <tilerendering> theprevioous one whatever.
[11:44:14] <taplar> any logic you want to happen after the promise resolves should be attached to it with a then(), done(), or one of the other callbacks
[11:44:19] <tilerendering> that´s what I wanted to achieve.
[11:44:30] <tilerendering> yes
[11:44:33] <tilerendering> this is done in here
[11:44:45] <taplar> if !hasError(login_sync("bogus","none")) --> throw Exception;
[11:44:52] <taplar> ^ that's trying to do synchronous processing
[11:45:06] <taplar> unless i'm missing something
[11:45:08] <tilerendering> that ´s the pseudo code
[11:45:14] <tilerendering> this is what I want to achieve
[11:45:35] <tilerendering> the question is how do I incorporate that in my code ? the code is there, what´s missing ?
[11:45:44] <tilerendering> the second call gets executed after the first one
[11:45:47] <tilerendering> that´s a fact
[11:46:00] <tilerendering> the question is: for instance, why is “responseholder” not filled ?
[11:51:26] <Hollusionist> why is the first parameter in .pushState(varName, '', 'google.com') only accessbile within the popostate event as e.target.varName ? why does it depend on the name of the variable?
[11:53:04] <robertmaxrees> because it's being added as a property to the target?
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding your popstate listener?
[11:53:37] <Hollusionist> $(window).on('popstate', function (e) {});
[11:54:06] <shoky> Hollusionist: e.state
[11:54:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use window.onpopstate fwiw.
[11:55:10] <Hollusionist> shoky: returns undefined
[11:55:28] <Hollusionist> e.target.state also undefined
[11:55:31] <shoky> Hollusionist: then it's undefined
[11:55:41] <Duikb00t-home> Hello I worked on some javascript filters with jquery, this works . But Currently I filter item out of a HTML structure but when I click an other Item I would like to reset the previous so it selects based on all elements
[11:55:43] <Duikb00t-home> https://www.pastery.net/phnxpz/
[11:55:46] <Hollusionist> but e.target.varName returns whatever ive set in varName
[11:56:12] <Hollusionist> why is i bound to the name of the var? how can i call the content of varName with a static prop?
[11:56:15] <shoky> Hollusionist:  e.target is probably window
[11:56:22] <robertmaxrees> Hollusionist i wonder if that's partially because you're using jquery to bind to that event
[11:56:22] <shoky> so you're doing window.varName
[11:57:13] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate
[11:57:23] <Hollusionist> shoky: how am i supposed to retrieve the firs and last parameter of pushState in within the popstate event
[11:58:12] <Hollusionist> .pushState(varName, '', 'google.com') where is the data of the parameters going to?
[11:58:23] <Hollusionist> robertmaxrees: i found no ansers in that article :(
[11:58:31] <robertmaxrees> Hollusionist don't use jquery for the popstate event.
[11:58:34] <robertmaxrees> that's my first point.
[11:58:44] <robertmaxrees> the event object is likely getting munged when you do that.
[11:59:27] <Duikb00t-home> Added some commets to explain my problem I don't think it's that hard to solve
[11:59:27] <Duikb00t-home> https://www.pastery.net/ftnegd/
[12:00:40] <shoky> Hollusionist:  e.state gets you the first one
[12:01:29] <Hollusionist> it returns null when using pure javascript to bin the event
[12:01:54] <Hollusionist> but my first parameter is efinetly not null in .pushState()
[12:02:05] <shoky> Hollusionist:  you're looking at the wrong state
[12:02:20] <shoky> Hollusionist:  go back/forward and you'll see the state you passed for that history entry
[12:02:32] <Hollusionist> i am loading a new page and doing a pushState via ajax
[12:02:42] <Hollusionist> then i press back on my browser
[12:02:50] <shoky> Hollusionist: then press forward
[12:02:57] <shoky> back, then forward
[12:03:28] <shoky> and if using jquery you'd need e.originalEvent.state btw
[12:06:59] <tilerendering> can anybody help me out with this ? http://pastebin.com/JuUDsRMp
[12:07:15] <Hollusionist> shoky: i see, that makes sense now, and where to i find the url (last parameter) ?
[12:08:19] <shoky> Hollusionist: location.href or location.pathname ..
[12:09:26] <shoky> Hollusionist: but you can put anything you want in the state object
[12:10:24] <Hollusionist> shoky: is it not stored within  e.originalEvent ?
[12:10:39] <Duikb00t-home> No one one an idea how I can clear my results ?
[12:10:40] <shoky> Hollusionist: no
[12:15:17] <Hollusionist> Duikb00t-home: you should make a jsfiddle
[12:15:26] <Duikb00t-home> solved it :)
[12:15:28] <Hollusionist> shoky: thank you for the help
[12:15:39] <Duikb00t-home> 'showing them all agian' after a click and then filtering again works
[12:26:20] <Duikb00t-home> People who used BXslider with responsive functionality? it seems it 'cuts' of some columns when scaling down ( it shows a column only half )
[12:41:18] <BadCodSmell> In jsperf $.parseHTML(html) is slower than $(html) which makes no sense, is there any obvious reason for this I might be overlooking?
[12:44:26] <BadCodSmell> wait I think the test is broken is why, someone puts in a space at the start of the html fragment
[13:20:10] <decx> makes sense
[13:20:21] <decx> $() isnt made for long ass html strings
[13:20:43] <decx> oh the channel died again
[13:20:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:20:58] <decx> great work keeping things running here taplar, a deserted wasteland
[13:21:04] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:21:05] <decx> ^^
[13:21:41] <decx> here i was looking at old pastes
[13:22:00] <taplar> huh?
[13:22:26] <taplar> sounds like praise.  i know i'm missreading
[13:22:33] <taplar> seriously, there's someone named praise in here?
[13:22:35] <taplar> lol
[13:23:01] * taplar goes back to annoying his co-workers with bad puns
[13:23:18] <robertmaxrees> taplar++ i do the same thing.
[13:23:47] <taplar> why did the baked potato get into a wreck at the 4-way?
[13:24:03] <taplar> right at the last minute, he spud up
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> I had a friend recently try his hand at taxidermy, but he did the wrong end of a lion.  It was a real cat-ass-trophy.
[13:24:47] <taplar> lmfao
[13:24:56] <decx> that's a kitten calamity
[13:25:59] <taplar> i have to admit, that joke was butta
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> i never think of things as being half-assed - more like the ass is half full.  butt what do i know?
[13:31:33] <decx> no
[13:31:36] <decx> no!
[13:31:44] <decx> the channel was dead and now you kicked it into ultra dead
[13:31:50] <Duikb00t-home> ohyay
[13:32:07] <decx> i looked at you old paste Duikb00t-home
[13:32:14] <decx> what was going on with all those clicks
[13:32:19] <Duikb00t-home> It's fixed.
[13:32:23] <Duikb00t-home> ;)
[13:32:25] <decx> i mean yeah sure a few clicks here and there but like 8
[13:32:41] <decx> and what do you do if you want to display bmw AND audi
[13:33:02] <Duikb00t-home> That's not a requiredment this time.
[13:33:44] <decx> i did a neat thing the other day
[13:33:49] <decx> for this stuff
[13:34:56] <Duikb00t-home> Oh
[13:35:10] <Duikb00t-home> Maybe when you select items I could push them into an array and loop the array to show them?
[13:35:25] <decx> yeah something like that
[13:35:27] <decx> mom
[13:37:16] <decx> Duikb00t-home: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/h05v5yaq/
[13:38:14] <Duikb00t-home> Sweet man! What's the difference between using a change event or a click?
[13:38:18] <Duikb00t-home> Is Select for checkboxes?
[13:38:31] <decx> that doesnt really matter
[13:39:06] <decx> what matters is you create an array for your active filters with reduce or like map() in jquery, and then use that when you loop through your containers to either show or hide
[14:07:38] <flashpoint9> I'm having trouble animating a scroll to top function. This is what i've tried so far http://paste.ofcode.org/b5tfXXrm5fgZkjHujcntKD, all 3 just shoot you to the top instantly no smooth transition, anyone know why?
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> what kind of element is anniversary-scrolltotop?
[14:08:19] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: div
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[14:08:54] <flashpoint9> none
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> and that div exists on pageload?  or does it get created by JS?
[14:09:26] <robertmaxrees> like, if you stick a console log inside that event handler, does it fire?
[14:10:04] <flashpoint9> its created server side via php
[14:11:01] <flashpoint9> hmmm, it may be cache, checking now
[14:12:08] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: i placed a console.log in the function but it doesn't show in the console but it does shoot to the top, how can that be?
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> the event handler isn't binding.
[14:12:26] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or something.
[14:32:45] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: ok so i figure it out
[14:33:19] <flashpoint9> I had multple classes on the page so i wrapped the original function in an each using this click inside
[14:34:56] <flashpoint9> actually thats broken now too, cache issue...
[14:38:53] <django_> for this:https://bpaste.net/show/4f378acaf56e alert works but console.log doesnt :/
[14:39:08] <django_> i always tried done the get and then .done it also wont console.log
[14:46:36] <tilerendering> can anyone give me a hint on this situation ? http://pastebin.com/uiaYKQwB
[14:47:40] <taplar> is catch a callback?
[14:48:36] <taplar> i don't see catch listed
[14:50:51] <tilerendering> taplar: where ?
[14:51:05] <taplar> as a valid function off of a promise
[14:51:48] <tilerendering> isnt it ??
[14:52:05] <tilerendering> I got advised earlier that I can do the error handling of subsequent .then´s within a .catch
[14:52:45] <taplar> ah, ok, yeah it is valid.  had to lookup the mdn page on it
[14:53:26] <tilerendering> it should be, my IDE autocompletes for the .catch and knows it. but still I get this behavior
[14:54:14] <Uhkis> tilerendering: what ide is that?
[14:54:57] <tilerendering> intellij idea
[15:03:18] <taplar> is something like this what your looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/u3nvL6nd/
[15:14:20] <tilerendering> taplar: maybe, maybe not. I d like to know what I m doing wrong in the code quoted
[15:18:01] <taplar> catch() looks like it is a ecma 6th edition function
[15:18:44] <tilerendering> hmm
[15:20:30] <taplar> doesn't look like that catch is a valid option off of the promise returned from jquery in that fiddle
[15:21:30] <taplar> it is there for jQuery 3
[15:22:01] <taplar> so that's probably part of their changes to make jquery meet the A+ standard
[15:22:18] <taplar> which it has not been
[15:33:48] <islalobo> taplar: thank you for the jsfiddle!
[15:34:03] <taplar> sure?  lol which one?
[15:34:56] <islalobo> Haha, the one from earlier today. I got distracted and never responded.
[15:35:02] <taplar> ah, cool
[15:35:37] <islalobo> So, hello, I'm curious if I can use a bootstrap progress bar to communicate to the user that ajax is processing: http://jsfiddle.net/U9xw6/18/
[15:37:09] <taplar> sure?  provided you can get the progress value from the ajax request some how
[15:37:34] <taplar> someone the other day said for things like file uploads apparently they have a progress event
[15:39:00] <taplar> btw, try not to store varaibles on window
[15:39:05] <taplar> *variables
[15:39:09] <tilerendering> taplar: hm thanks. But I foudn the “bug”: I needed to use Promise.resolve explicitly.
[15:39:21] <tilerendering> also, I learned how to throw custom business exceptions as oppsed to technical exceptions
[15:39:29] <tilerendering> quite some advances for me today as a js newbie
[15:39:33] <tilerendering> (but ok, coming from Java)
[15:39:40] <taplar> cool deal
[15:43:17] <islalobo> taplar: is that a reference to the jsfiddle?
[15:43:41] <taplar> islalobo: yeah, one moment, i'm fiddling with it
[15:53:13] <nsosa> Hi, I'm trying to get the 'tag' value out of this function to another function how can I do it? https://jsfiddle.net/1scnytfq/

[16:52:51] <mickotronic> Hi all I have a question re jquery submit() function and passing modified serialized form data to it
[16:53:07] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[16:55:31] <mickotronic> How do I pass modified serialized data to the submit() function?
[16:55:43] <mickotronic> without using aja
[16:55:46] <mickotronic> *ajax
[16:56:08] <robertmaxrees> err, you don't.  gotta modify the form directly instead.
[16:56:46] <mickotronic> So modify the form prior to submit to include the button name and val
[16:56:50] <mickotronic> and submit
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:57:09] <mickotronic> Sounds like a plan, I'll give it a go, thanks rob
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> def.
[18:01:12] <bruce_dev> I know this isn't particularly a "web design" channel, but I cannot find any channel for such...so I have a simple question with a screenshot for ease. What kind of designing would this be called? http://w3theory.com/clients/KC/login.html
[18:01:12] <bruce_dev>  it would be for a web browser game (not flash or anything)
[18:02:47] <hiljusti> not really sure what kind of answer you're looking for
[18:02:54] <taplar> what do you mean what kind?  And there's ##web you could try
[18:03:59] <taplar> or maybe it's #web
[18:05:43] <z1haze> Hello, I'm currently building an admin panel and I plan to make these widget boxes, but I wanted to be able to move them around, and save their place somehow. How would I go about doing that
[18:10:02] <hiljusti> i'd start by looking into jquery ui https://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[18:10:35] <z1haze> more or less thining like this: http://www.skypoet.net/yui/examples/iGoogle/iGoogle1.html where its set to a grid
[18:11:57] <z1haze> ah cool: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets
[18:14:22] <hiljusti> nice :)
[18:14:38] <hiljusti> it's probably going to be easier to integrate than the source of the iGoogle bit you linked
[18:36:48] <nsosa> hello, I'm trying to get the tag variable value out of this function , how can I do that? https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/1/
[18:38:59] <nsosa> anybody?
[19:06:14] <nsosa> how do I get a value out of a function nested?
[19:58:28] <gundas> Hi all I'm stuck on cross domain issues. In my API code (PHP) I have set my headers as "header("Access-Control-Allow-Orgin: *"); header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *");" but I still get issues with Cross Domain - any tips to get this working?
[21:22:36] <moncholo1> Hi can, anybody help me to get a value inside a function in jquery?
[21:56:21] <asidjazz> depends on if that function is written to allow you to get that value
[21:57:46] <asidjazz> .
[22:01:45] <montoto1> acidjazz: can I show you the function?
[22:01:56] <montoto1> it's driving me crazy
[22:02:58] <montoto1> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/2/
[22:03:44] <acidjazz> so its doing a get on an mp3 file
[22:03:54] <acidjazz> are you getting a console.log from it?
[22:04:03] <montoto1> I know it has do to with the scope
[22:04:03] <montoto1> but I cannot figure out how to get the value out
[22:04:13] <acidjazz> jquery doesnt have a .read()
[22:04:45] <acidjazz> so you're using a media tag reader
[22:05:12] <acidjazz> this i assume? https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags
[22:05:26] <acidjazz> are you getting the json output
[22:07:19] <montoto1> acidjazz
[22:07:21] <montoto1> yes it works
[22:07:28] <montoto1> I can get the tag value in the console
[22:07:39] <montoto1> but I want to use that value outside the function
[22:07:44] <montoto1> in another function
[22:07:50] <acidjazz> well that value doesnt exist until that function is done
[22:07:58] <acidjazz> so you need to call your other function from w/in the .onSuccess
[22:08:07] <acidjazz> and pass the value to it
[22:08:30] <montoto1> I have a function, inside that function I have this jsmediatags
[22:08:48] <acidjazz> so now write function processtag(tag) { stuff you want to do; }
[22:09:02] <acidjazz> then inside onSuccess: function(tag) { processtag(tag); }
[22:09:35] <montoto1> I don't know if I get what you are telling me, let me add more stuff to the jsfiddle to be more clear
[22:10:41] <montoto1> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/3/
[22:11:24] <acidjazz> ok so
[22:12:03] <acidjazz> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/4/
[22:12:23] <montoto1> oh
[22:12:29] <montoto1> let me try that :)
[22:14:51] <montoto1> yes !!! now it works:):)
[22:14:56] <montoto1> I have been stuck the whole day
[22:14:58] <montoto1> with this
[22:15:11] <montoto1> didn't know about processTag, gotta read how it works and what it does
[22:15:17] <montoto1> thanks a lot acidjazz!
[22:15:52] <acidjazz> sure :)
[22:16:03] <acidjazz> so processTag is something I made up
[22:16:09] <acidjazz> you can call it whatever you want
[22:16:28] <acidjazz> I named it that assuming you were going to do stuff to the tag info w/in that function
[22:16:30] <montoto1> ahh ok lol
[22:16:32] <acidjazz> all we did is move stuff around
[22:16:59] <acidjazz> you should look into iterationg through the tag info, etc next
[22:17:09] <montoto1> is a little bit confusing how javascript works regarding variables and scopes
[22:17:15] <montoto1> for a newbie like me
[22:17:19] <acidjazz> well its a good start
[22:21:58] <D-rex> is there a way to track mouse from distance of element?
[22:22:17] <D-rex> I searched google but all of the tutorials or snippets seem to track mouse location from center of element
[22:30:30] <montoto1> acidjazz, are you still there?
[22:30:39] <montoto1> I have another question
[22:42:02] <montoto1> acidjazz: in your example https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/4/ I can get the value inside the processTag function, but what I really need is to get the value of tag in the parent function $('.jumbotron').on('change','#hello', function(event){
[22:43:34] <acidjazz> the uhm
[22:43:52] <acidjazz> so on chnage
[22:43:57] <acidjazz> what is jumbotron
[22:43:59] <acidjazz> a pull down?
[22:44:07] <montoto1> a class
[22:44:13] <montoto1> inside that class there is an input button
[22:44:27] <montoto1> when I click the input button I upload a file, an mp3, I want to read the id3 tag
[22:44:50] <montoto1> all this works, the problem is I need the value of tag inside the change function
[22:44:59] <montoto1> that
[22:45:42] <acidjazz> well a .change is when a pulldown input is changed, altered
[22:45:51] <montoto1> yes
[22:46:02] <acidjazz> if you want to execute thigns after a file is uploaded
[22:46:16] <montoto1> no, I want to execute things before the file is uploaded
[22:46:27] <montoto1> when .change ocurrs
[22:46:28] <montoto1> I'm using ajax
[22:46:39] <acidjazz> ok i see so .change w/ an input of tyep file
[22:46:46] <montoto1> yes
[22:47:01] <montoto1> but I need to get the value of tag in the .change function
[22:47:06] <acidjazz> so in your .cahnge youll need to grab the file they selected
[22:47:18] <montoto1> I need to grab the id3 tag of the file
[22:47:23] <acidjazz> 1st step is the file
[22:47:28] <montoto1> that is what jsmediatags does
[22:47:36] <acidjazz> i believe var file = $(this).val(); should do it
[22:47:47] <montoto1> no
[22:48:08] <acidjazz> in your .change you need to grab the file, var file = $(this).val();
[22:48:09] <montoto1> I just need to have the value of tag to be used inside the .change function
[22:48:15] <acidjazz> then pass it to jsmediatags
[22:48:22] <montoto1> all that works
[22:48:29] <montoto1> is passing the value to jsmediatag
[22:48:32] <acidjazz> jsmediatags.read(file, ...);
[22:48:36] <montoto1> yes
[22:48:44] <acidjazz> ok so you're set
[22:48:45] <montoto1> provides the id3 value , inside the tag variable
[22:48:59] <montoto1> I need to get the value of the tag variable back to the .change function
[22:49:01] <acidjazz> inside your onSuccess: function(tag) {};
[22:49:19] <acidjazz> what is the reason what do you want to do next
[22:49:30] <montoto1> ok the reason is
[22:49:46] <montoto1> I have a form , I want the input file button to upload an mp3 file
[22:50:11] <montoto1> and I want to use the jsmediatag to preopulate the form with has the name of the mp3
[22:50:20] <montoto1> for that to happen
[22:50:34] <montoto1> I need to get the value of tag which contains the tittle of the mp3
[22:50:40] <montoto1> inside the .change fucntion
[22:51:25] <montoto1> if I don't get the tag value inside the .change function, when I post the form it gets the old value and it does not post the "tag" value
[22:51:35] <acidjazz> ok so
[22:51:57] <montoto1> so I have to get that information out of the OnSucess inot the parent function
[22:52:09] <acidjazz> is this an id3v2
[22:52:10] <acidjazz> or mp4
[22:52:20] <montoto1> id3v2
[22:52:25] <acidjazz> so where in this json object is the title
[22:52:41] <acidjazz> i see tags.artist
[22:52:44] <acidjazz> tag.album
[22:52:47] <acidjazz> TPE1?
[22:52:48] <montoto1> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/6/
[22:52:52] <montoto1> TPE2
[22:53:10] <acidjazz> tag.tags.TPE2.title ?
[22:53:13] <montoto1> tag['tags']['title'] gives me
[22:53:14] <montoto1> yes
[22:53:33] <acidjazz> ok gotcha
[22:53:38] <montoto1> but I need to define a variable inside .change called mp3title with the value of tag.tags.TPE2.title
[22:53:58] <acidjazz> well JS doesnt really work like that
[22:54:05] <acidjazz> inside .change(), we dont have our title yet
[22:54:12] <acidjazz> its only inside onSuccess that we have our title
[22:54:30] <montoto1> so there is no way to get it out?
[22:54:33] <acidjazz> so you need to do what you're going to do w/ the title inside onSuccess
[22:54:41] <montoto1> I can't do that
[22:54:46] <montoto1> well I can
[22:54:47] <acidjazz> or write something outside of that that does it
[22:55:00] <acidjazz> there's a way to get out i'm just trying to explain this so you understand how it works
[22:55:05] <montoto1> I see
[22:55:16] <acidjazz> ok so tell me what you want to do w/ the title
[22:55:20] <acidjazz> display it somehwere right?
[22:55:23] <montoto1> yes
[22:55:23] <acidjazz> on a form?
[22:55:28] <montoto1> yes
[22:55:34] <montoto1> I can display it now
[22:55:36] <acidjazz> ok lets say you have <div class="ttile">LLoading title..<?div>
[22:55:40] <montoto1> it displays on the form fine
[22:55:42] <acidjazz> on your HTML
[22:55:50] <montoto1> the problem is that is inside OnSucess
[22:55:53] <montoto1> so when you post the form
[22:55:58] <montoto1> is like it's not there really
[22:56:03] <montoto1> when you refresh the page
[22:56:10] <acidjazz> well OnSuccess means we have successfully gotten the title
[22:56:18] <montoto1> yes
[22:56:22] <acidjazz> so it's not until we get there taht we have it
[22:56:47] <acidjazz> so its from there we either place our title where we want it, or call a function that does that
[22:57:00] <ni291187> hello guys do you know where could i find a chatbox plugin for a website? jquery php with login and logout functionalities?
[22:57:19] <acidjazz> now you can get the title outside of onSuccess but onSuccess has to deliver it there
[22:57:35] <montoto1> it has to have the closure rigjht?
[22:58:08] <montoto1> because it is in a diff scope
[22:58:11] <montoto1> ?
[22:58:38] <acidjazz> well scope is one thing, but more importantly the title 1st exists inside onSuccess
[22:58:52] <montoto1> it exists inside OnSucess
[22:58:55] <montoto1> that part works
[22:59:00] <acidjazz> right so you have to work from there
[22:59:16] <acidjazz> .onSuccess is fired by jsmediatags after it gets hte mp3 and parses the data
[22:59:20] <acidjazz> this can take time
[22:59:20] <acidjazz> 1 second
[22:59:22] <acidjazz> 0.1seconds
[22:59:23] <acidjazz> 10 seconds
[22:59:32] <acidjazz> but it asyncrhonous, not when your page loads
[22:59:40] <acidjazz> therefor it cant exist when someone lodas your web page
[22:59:53] <acidjazz> its stuff happening after they choose an mp3
[23:00:16] <acidjazz> the code you have in on()
[23:00:18] <acidjazz> in .on()
[23:00:24] <acidjazz> its executed when someone chooses a file
[23:00:31] <acidjazz> all of it at once
[23:00:44] <acidjazz> but jsmediatags calls .onSuccess after taht, when its found your id3v2 data
[23:01:08] <acidjazz> anyways so what exactly do you want to do w/ the title ? show it on the form right?
[23:01:13] <montoto1> yes
[23:01:17] <acidjazz> so you can simply do that in ONSuccess
[23:01:19] <montoto1> so the user doesn't have to type it
[23:01:24] <montoto1> the problem is
[23:01:25] <acidjazz> or write a function that places the title where you want it
[23:01:28] <acidjazz> and have onSuccess call that function
[23:01:34] <montoto1> ok,
[23:01:36] <acidjazz> ok i see
[23:01:41] <acidjazz> so then the title is an input value
[23:01:51] <montoto1> yes is a text box
[23:01:56] <acidjazz> let me see the text box
[23:02:00] <acidjazz> paste the HTML here or jsfiddle
[23:02:19] <montoto1> I have made it work if I populate the textbox inside OnSucess already
[23:02:27] <montoto1> it shows on the screen
[23:02:36] <montoto1> th eproblem is
[23:02:52] <montoto1> that inside the .change I make an ajax call to post the form data plus the file the mp3
[23:03:18] <montoto1> the form data I'm sending does not include this change
[23:03:31] <acidjazz> ok so then inside the .change
[23:03:33] <montoto1> I thought it was because it cannot read the tag variable which is in a different scope
[23:03:36] <acidjazz> you need to re-grab the title value
[23:03:41] <acidjazz> so that you get your updated title name
[23:03:47] <montoto1> but as you mentioned it could be because of the asynchronous thing
[23:03:59] <acidjazz> late
[23:04:54] <acidjazz> so all you have to do montoto1 is place the updated title
[23:05:01] <acidjazz> show me hte code that submits the form
[23:06:31] <montoto1> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/7/
[23:06:45] <montoto1> thats code inside .change
[23:07:32] <acidjazz> ok so that code down there
[23:07:37] <acidjazz> where you get your formdata
[23:07:52] <acidjazz> you need to call that AFTER you place your title in onSuccess()
[23:08:04] <acidjazz> so just take all that code from line 29 to line 50
[23:08:19] <acidjazz> and wrap it inside function sendForm() { /* inside here 8? }
[23:08:22] <acidjazz> and wrap it inside function sendForm() { /* inside here */ }
[23:08:26] <acidjazz> ok
[23:08:34] <acidjazz> then insude onSuccess, you do your thing to place the right title
[23:08:38] <acidjazz> and then call sendForm()
[23:08:46] <acidjazz> your updated title will be grabbed instead of the previous title
[23:09:00] <acidjazz> got it?
[23:09:05] <montoto1> yeah
[23:09:13] <montoto1> but it is after right now
[23:09:17] <montoto1> that's the order the code is
[23:09:20] <montoto1> as I showed you
[23:09:25] <acidjazz> not neccessarily
[23:09:30] <acidjazz> because that code is not inside a function
[23:09:35] <montoto1> yes
[23:09:41] <montoto1> the code is inside .change
[23:09:45] <acidjazz> so its actually run whenever
[23:09:46] <montoto1> function
[23:09:47] <acidjazz> ok here
[23:09:49] <acidjazz> let me show you
[23:09:57] <montoto1> it is run when I click the input file to submit a file
[23:10:52] <acidjazz> https://jsfiddle.net/3qem6k6p/8/
[23:10:57] <acidjazz> ok but we dont want it to run then
[23:11:05] <acidjazz> we want it to run AFTER you have placed your updated title
[23:11:08] <acidjazz> from the id3v2
[23:11:18] <acidjazz> so it then scoops up the updated title
[23:11:25] <montoto1> ahh
[23:11:27] <montoto1> I see
[23:11:39] <montoto1> I though I had to copy paste everything inside OnSucess
[23:11:40] <montoto1> :)
[23:11:43] <montoto1> success
[23:11:53] <acidjazz> no you can just make functions
[23:11:57] <acidjazz> so its easier to read
[23:12:09] <montoto1> so now I can add that function inside OnSuccess
[23:12:17] <acidjazz> yes
[23:12:23] <acidjazz> BELOW you placing the title in the form
[23:12:23] <montoto1> and if it fails and it does not find the id3 title tag
[23:12:25] <acidjazz> in the input box
[23:12:48] <montoto1> I add the function again in onError
[23:13:57] <montoto1> let me try to do that brb
[23:15:03] <acidjazz> so you're sort of getting it
[23:15:12] <acidjazz> the lesson here is to figure out when things run
[23:15:31] <acidjazz> any javascript outside of a function will get executed immediately
[23:16:50] <montoto1> it worked!!!!
[23:17:01] <montoto1> what a dummy, I have been the whole afternoon trying to figure this out,
[23:17:20] <montoto1> I didn't want to copy paste code inside OnSuccess, I should have thought about making a function of the ajax post
[23:17:47] <montoto1> thanks a lot acidjazz I really appreciate all your help and patience
[23:17:52] <islalobo> We're using gulp to compile our js, if I want to run some jquery on ready / pageload what is the best way to make sure it only happens on a particular page?
[23:23:10] <acidjazz> montoto1: no prob!
[23:23:22] <acidjazz> islalobo: only place it on that page?
[23:23:47] <acidjazz> islalobo: gulp is more server-side stuff compared to a ready/pageload being in the browser.. not really following
[23:32:41] <z1haze> tryin to use gridster i found an npm package but it says it cnat find it
[23:33:39] <montoto1> gonna hit the sack
[23:33:41] <montoto1> goodnight!
[23:33:49] <islalobo> acidjazz: it's compiling all the js, yeah, i guess just including it on that page but it's doesn't have a unique page template
[23:35:28] <acidjazz> islalobo: well then you need to find something unique to control it right
[23:35:51] <acidjazz> islalobo: so maybe place it on every page but think of some way for it to know which one its on and do its thang from that
[23:39:00] <islalobo> I tried looking for a specific class
