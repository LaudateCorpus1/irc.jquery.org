[01:09:41] <jge_> Hey all good morning, can someone please shed some light, trying to get my recaptcha to work on a contact form. I've set the disable attribute on the submit button then I have it enable again on recaptcha callback, but it's not working.. button remains inactive. Read tons of things online but nothing is working.. my relevant config: https://hastebin.com/enogasedin.cs
[01:09:45] <jge_> any help is appreciated
[03:13:35] <AciD`> hey guys
[03:15:30] <AciD`> I stumbled upon this code `return $domElement.is('input[type=text], input[type=hidden], input[type=tel], input:not([type])');`, I was wondering how I could translate the `input:not([type])` part. So far I have `return (domElement.type === 'text' || domElement.type === 'hidden' || domElement.type === 'tel');` but miss the last test
[05:39:40] <WhirledPress> AciD, wut?
[05:40:05] <AciD`> what?
[05:40:28] <WhirledPress> that's what I said
[05:40:45] <WhirledPress> WHat are you trying to do?
[05:41:05] <AciD`> WhirledPress -> I'm trying to understand how `is()` work. For instance, how would you translate `$domElement.is(':focus')` into pure JS?
[05:41:45] <WhirledPress> did you look at the jquery source code...that's prolly the best way to decipher how it works since jquery is js
[05:45:29] <WhirledPress> in the use case of just checking if an element has focus, I don't know that you can do that without setting up an event handler to capture focus using pure js.

[09:10:23] <rjCousineau> Hi i'm trying to set sortable with a header or footer.  I'm using :not(:first-child, :last-child).  If theres only  a header/footer I can't seem to get it to placehold between
[11:40:43] <askz> Hi, I have some mystic happening here, searching the internet for 3h+; (this worked before) : http://pastebin.com/5rcLc9P9 ; I trigger a custom event (quiz:answer) inside an AJAX request callback, this works like a charm the first time, the listener receive all the events (20 each time) and then, the second time the listener doesn't react. I'd appreciate some insights or path to dig this bug out! Thanks
[11:43:20] <mr-tux> Hey all good morning, can someone please shed some light, trying to get my recaptcha to work on a contact form. I've set the disable attribute on the submit button then I have it enable again on recaptcha callback, but it's not working.. button remains inactive. Read tons of things online but nothing is working.. my relevant config: https://hastebin.com/enogasedin.cs
[11:45:48] <askz> hi mr-tux ; do you have checked if the callback is actually fired?
[11:45:58] <askz> (sorry for my english)
[11:46:07] <mr-tux> hey there
[11:46:27] <mr-tux> no problem, umm not sure how I would do that
[11:46:36] <askz> console.log('hello') ?
[11:46:39] <askz> inside the callback?
[11:46:51] <mr-tux> within the javascript code?
[11:47:16] <askz> yup. inside the recaptchaCallback func
[11:47:51] <mr-tux> let me check, one sec
[11:50:35] <askz> you should see "hello" in your console
[11:52:39] <mr-tux> askz: ok changed it to this now : https://hastebin.com/sidaxusiri.js
[11:52:44] <mr-tux> let me see if it's working
[11:53:46] <askz> superb
[11:54:56] <mr-tux> askz: yeah not seeing it in my console output, I'm getting this: ReCAPTCHA couldn't find user-provided function: recaptchaCallback
[11:55:05] <mr-tux> weird.. can't find the function?
[11:55:16] <mr-tux> let me check names match
[11:55:48] <askz> maybe your function is declared after recaptcha js code
[11:56:39] <mr-tux> hmm, yeah the script src for main.js is my last entry
[11:56:52] <mr-tux> i load the recaptcha api.js before
[11:56:59] <mr-tux> could that be it?
[11:57:40] <askz> your callback is in main.js? so yeah that could be
[11:57:49] <mr-tux> yes it is
[11:57:59] <mr-tux> ok let me source it before the recaptcha js
[12:00:19] <mr-tux> same thing
[12:01:42] <mr-tux> hmm, something weird is happening.. when I look at the console output next to where the error appears, it says where is looking for the function and it's not main.js
[12:01:55] <mr-tux> it's looking for it here: https://www.gstatic.com/recaptcha/api2/r20170213115309/recaptcha__en.js
[12:02:09] <mr-tux> why would it be looking for it there?
[12:05:00] <mr-tux> I  think it has to do with the way I'm loading the recaptcha widget
