[02:00:22] <Cork> plamb: sure, it would catch bubbling change events; though note it won't catch changes except from elements that actually fire change events
[02:00:33] <Cork> (meaning form elements)

[03:23:51] <JscriptKiddy> Hi there... is there some one here?
[03:24:25] <JscriptKiddy> I have an easy noob question about Jquery
[03:24:36] <JscriptKiddy> Cane someone please help?
[03:25:02] <JscriptKiddy> I guess not
[03:45:10] <nindustries> Hi, I have a very CPU-expensive function that blocks my website when done. I tried with setTimeout(func()) but it still blocks everything. Ideas ?
[03:54:22] <dminuoso_> Hi. Im sending an ajax request using $.ajax({ /* some stuff */ data: { foo: { bar: quux }}}) where quux has some properties with an undefined value. Ajax skips those properties, do I have to transform these properties to empty strings first?
[05:23:06] <Cork> dminuoso_: you have to transform them into the data you want to send
[05:23:18] <Cork> dminuoso_: params can't represent undefined
[07:07:05] <hellyeah> is it possible to write code with dependency injection in jquery?
[07:07:44] <Cork> hellyeah: not built in no
[07:08:19] <Cork> runtime dependency resolve is costly in javascript as it results in separate http requests
[07:08:25] <hellyeah> well c# and java has framework for that i know
[07:08:31] <hellyeah> ah
[07:08:37] <Cork> so it is normally handled server side
[07:08:55] <hellyeah> but angular does "denedency injection" right
[07:09:18] <Cork> there are several libs that does it
[07:09:35] <Cork> some with a server side, some as separate requests
[07:10:22] <hellyeah> you mean you do "dependency injection" in server side?
[07:10:36] <Cork> no dependency resolving
[07:10:52] <hellyeah> dependency resolving in server-side
[07:11:00] <hellyeah> oh right sorry
[07:11:01] <Cork> meaning you figure out what dependencies the given code has and include them in the data sent
[07:12:27] <hellyeah> dependency that code has you mean for example you use method from moment.js and you send your data with date that is formatted with the method of moment js. And here momentjs is just dependency?
[07:15:01] <hellyeah> did i get wrong?
[07:16:35] <Cork> hellyeah: more like in the file you define that it requires the moment lib, and the bundling script includes that libs as it prepares the script for production
[07:16:44] <Cork> this is how jquery ui is built for example
[07:16:54] <Cork> require.js does it if i remember correctly
[07:17:06] <Cork> and angular
[07:17:18] <Cork> (personally i prefer to just do it manually)
[07:17:36] <hellyeah> do it dependency resolving manually?
[07:19:44] <Cork> yes
[07:20:16] <Cork> basically i have a folder structure where a server script merges the files into a big resource for production
[07:20:28] <Cork> and then i drop files in there as needed for what the project needs
[07:20:53] <Cork> i like it cause it makes for a very simple and robust system
[07:21:13] <Cork> and it doesn't require much extra work either
[07:22:33] <hellyeah> i understand
[07:24:08] <hellyeah> it is like using it again and again in different project. Probably i need to learn how to do it for backend
[07:24:11] <hellyeah> is it correct?
[07:25:17] <Cork> not really sure what you're asking
[07:34:09] <hellyeah> nevermind
[07:34:10] <hellyeah> :D
[07:34:21] <hellyeah> so use dependency resolving in the backend
[07:46:21] <nindustries> Hi, I have a very CPU-expensive function that blocks my website when done. I tried with setTimeout(func()) but it still blocks everything. Ideas ?
[07:46:58] <micrypt> Having some trouble modifying a jQuery collection. https://gist.github.com/micrypt/1725b84a9e88df5af829ece7e76d9d7a - the elements are returned unchanged.
[07:46:58] <hellyeah> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
[07:47:08] <hellyeah> is there equal method in jquery for that?
[07:47:54] <systemfault> .css
[07:48:36] <systemfault> nindustries: setTimeout only schedule the computation to a later time, it doesn't make that computation async.
[07:48:42] <hellyeah> what
[07:48:43] <hellyeah> css?
[07:48:45] <systemfault> nindustries: You would need to change the algorithm
[07:48:47] <micrypt> More precisely, line #5 returns an empty collection even though there ought to be a match present. The $nodes collection within the Chrome console > https://www.dropbox.com/s/831zqbiw192zb4e/Screenshot%202016-10-11%2012.48.17.png?dl=0
[07:48:47] <hellyeah> .css("")
[07:48:53] <nindustries> systemfault: darn it, impossible.
[07:49:05] <systemfault> nindustries: Another possibility is to use a webworker.
[07:50:18] <systemfault> hellyeah: Doing something.css('someproperty') is the jQuery equivalent of using getComputedStyle and accessing a property of the result.
[07:51:19] <hellyeah> systemfault:  i actually want to get all css property at once
[07:51:42] <systemfault> I don't know if jQuery can do that... seems totally useless to me.
[07:52:41] <systemfault> You can pass it an array of properties you want... or a string
[07:54:13] <hellyeah> yeah i can do that but each time it is not possible what rules are defined.
[07:55:28] <systemfault> What?
[07:55:47] <hellyeah> ops sorry for my english
[07:55:56] <hellyeah> i can put it all rules into array
[07:56:13] <hellyeah> but first i need to get all rules in spesific element
[08:26:37] <dranve> hey guys, how can i delay iteration each pass for a second, i tried this, but it doesn't work http://pastebin.com/JN4ZT0Zh
[08:27:24] <Cork> dranve: you need to make each step called from inside the timer
[08:27:42] <Cork> else you will delay everything with the same time as the loop will happen at the same time
[08:27:46] <dranve> was that the first example i did?
[08:28:34] <Cork> so do function step(index) { arr[step); setTimeout(function() { next(++index); }, 1000); }; step(0)
[08:28:44] <Cork> (don't forget checking for when you hit the end of the loop)
[09:19:06] <MikeD_> btw, is that a typo:  arr[step);  ?
[09:34:37] <stennowork> good day, i have several DOM elements to which i have bound data using $(foo).data("bar", baz);. Now i need the element whose "bar" value is baz. is there a convenient way to achieve that with jquery?
[09:35:16] <stennowork> i saw there is the ":data(foo)" jquery selector but for some mind-boggling reason its only in jquery-ui
[09:37:25] <stennowork> this is jquery 2.2.4 because we have to use a plugin that doesn't support a newer version
[09:38:29] <stennowork> the $("[data-foo=bar]") selector of course only works for actual data- attributes
[09:38:51] <nebby> Hello. I'm using jQuery to do an ajax call and download an image. But the ajax dataType parameters want either html, xml, json or string...
[09:38:51] <stennowork> not for those bound with .data()
[09:38:55] <nebby> I'm not sure what to pick
[09:38:56] <shoky> stennowork: $(selector).filter(function() { return $(this).data("bar") === baz })
[09:39:21] <stennowork> shoky, blerp, that was what i was doing, i hoped there was a better way. thanks!
[09:40:04] <stennowork> any reason why ":data(foo)" is only in jquery-ui?
[09:40:15] <stennowork> i mean https://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[09:40:27] <shoky> because jquery-ui uses it internally, probably
[09:40:41] <stennowork> hmm fair enough
[09:40:50] <stennowork> in my opinion it'd be a nice addition to vanilla jq
[09:41:20] <shoky> what if the data is not a simple strnig/number
[09:41:27] <shoky> selectors are not much use for arbitrary data
[09:41:49] <shoky> or if you want to compare the data with something other than ===
[09:42:10] <stennowork> hm yeah
[09:42:53] <stennowork> as i look closely now, :data(foo) only finds those where that key was bound, and doesn't actually have a way to compare the _value_
[09:42:59] <stennowork> so it'd be useless in my case anyway
[09:43:04] <shoky> ah
[09:44:22] <stennowork> well thanks for the help and insight
[09:48:21] <shoky> shure
[09:50:03] <hellyeah> i am using .data attribute when i do ajax call
[09:51:49] <hellyeah> i have json string and i will traverse json string and create buttons as much as the length of json string
[09:51:52] <hellyeah> and assign value of key to the data attribute of button
[09:51:52] <hellyeah> is it good practice?
[09:51:52] <hellyeah> hoing it is understandable
[09:52:43] * stennowork has to admit that he struggles to understand what hellyeah is trying to say :/
[09:53:09] <hellyeah> let me try again
[09:53:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:53:41] <hellyeah> you have json obj like [{a = b, x = y, z= t}]
[09:53:47] <hellyeah> syntax may be wrong
[09:54:02] <stennowork> yep :P
[09:54:21] <hellyeah> think like you traverse your json with for loop and create buttons in this case three buttons :D
[09:54:52] <stennowork> yeah ok?
[09:55:05] <hellyeah> and in the meantime you define button.id('id', button + 'id'); so each button  have id like button1, button2, button3
[09:55:51] <hellyeah> and also you assign each value with obj.a, obj.x, obj.z to button's data attribute
[09:56:04] <shoky> nebby: don't think jquery's ajax is really suitable for downloading binary data. why are you downloading an image via ajax anyway
[09:56:10] <hellyeah> so when you click button you will do ajax call with parameter b, y, t :D
[09:56:16] <hellyeah> hope understandable
[09:56:22] <stennowork> eeh >_>"
[09:56:24] <hellyeah> it may work for you :D
[09:56:39] <stennowork> i am not sure ^_^"
[09:56:52] <hellyeah> so when you click button1 you will send b to the backend
[09:56:56] <hellyeah> "b"
[09:56:58] <hellyeah> anyway
[09:57:07] <hellyeah> just try to help :D
[09:57:13] <hellyeah> thats my new trend anyway
[09:57:16] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[09:57:27] <nebby> shoky: For a very specific reason. I am using Unity3D to build my WebGL app. Unfortunately, I am having trouble with Unity's in-built web request API - the progress function isn't working. So, I am now doing the request in JavaScript. It works, but I need to send the JPG data back into Unity.
[09:59:41] <nebby> shoky: I think it's actually working with jQuery, I just don't know what format to accept that data as again in C#
[09:59:59] <shoky> nebby: well i donno much about that, but you can bypass jquery's data processing with  processData: false  option
[10:00:11] <nebby> okay, that might help
[10:00:18] <nebby> and then what format will it be in shoky?
[10:00:19] <nebby> binary?
[10:03:24] <shoky> donno, don't think so. try and see i guess.. think you might need to forgo jquery for this one
[10:04:06] <shoky> unless you can get the image in a textual format like base64 encoding, if you can use that
[10:20:55] <z1haze_work> Hi, I have a problem explained here: https://github.com/Olapic/PublicDocs/issues/6 I need to load this widget via their sdk rather than on page load, but im using vuejs, a js framework that uses view models so im not sure where im supposed to put thes callback functions
[10:21:05] <z1haze_work> is it possible to append a script section of functions to the body
[10:32:06] <z1haze_work> i need to load this after page load http://dpaste.com/00HCQ6V how could i do it
[10:44:08] <relipse> can someone please explain why my jquery is throwing javascript errors: https://www.handofhelp.com/profile.php?cid=87
[10:44:43] <relipse> shared.js:50 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).resize is not a function
[10:45:27] <shoky> relipse: not getting any errors
[10:49:20] <relipse> shoky: oh?
[10:49:37] <relipse> i cleared cache and i'm still getting shared.js:50 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).resize is not a function
[10:50:05] <shoky> that's the only error? it's not failing to load jquery before or something?
[10:50:17] <shoky> but ya, no errors here
[10:51:07] <shoky> don't use jquery/js for that anyway, use media queries
[10:53:39] <relipse> ok it worked in incognito
[10:53:44] <relipse> not sure whats up with my chrome
[10:53:49] <relipse> thanks

[11:32:50] <Desdf> Good afternoon all
[11:35:43] <Desdf> I have a question re Jquery 3.1.1. I build the apps in Cordova on VS2015 and when I try and use 3.1.1. with Jquery Mobile version 1.4.5. everything shows on one page. When I revert back to Jquery 2.2.4. I dont have any problem app works perfectly
[11:38:34] <taplar> latest mobile version may not be updated to work with 3x yet
[11:39:11] <Desdf> Ok I thought as much, thanks.
[12:13:46] <z1haze_work> im trying to initialize some plugins on the open callback of a jquery-ui dialog.. but it doesnt seem to be happening
[12:14:10] <z1haze_work> i can console log, and alert from the function, and i can even copy the code into the console an the slider will initialize, but for some reason it will not initialize in the open callback itself
[12:14:19] <z1haze_work> and whats odd is a few days ago it was working fine
[12:18:20] * hlve slaps Desdf with a trout.
[12:54:37] <al_nz1> Morning peoples
[13:19:28] <al_nz1> I have a line : $("#iwi.selectpicker").selectpicker('hide'); - does this translate to find id="iwi" ?
[13:29:09] <shoky> al_nz1: that and it has to have the class selectpicker
[13:36:08] <al_nz1> hi shoky
[13:36:09] <al_nz1> ok
[13:36:23] <al_nz1> why does this:     $("select:contains('iwi')").hide(); not hide this <select class="selectpicker show-tick" id="iwi0" data-live-search="true" title="Choose" data-width="100%">
[13:37:31] <shoky> al_nz1:  :contains only looks in the inner html of the element.  don't use an id for this, use a class.   $('select.iwi').hide()
[13:38:14] <al_nz1> shoky: so it looks between <select> and </select> ? not inside the tag itself?
[13:38:28] <shoky> pretty much
[13:38:50] <al_nz1> and what if I have a series of iwi tags, like iwi0, iwi1, iwi2 etc?
[13:39:08] <shoky> what you really want is..  <select class="selectpicker show-tick iwi" data-iwi-num="0" ...>
[13:39:21] <shoky> and $('select.iwi').hide()  to hide all of them
[13:39:38] <al_nz1> data-iwi-num=0 ?
[13:39:40] <shoky> and you can use .data('iwi-num')  to get the iwi-num of an element
[13:39:51] <shoky> yes, instead of putting that as part of an id
[13:39:52] <al_nz1> oh, thats cool
[13:40:40] <shoky> of course i just called it iwi-num cause i have no idea what it stands for, give ti a more suitable name if you got it :P
[13:41:21] <al_nz1> shoky: but data-iwi-num never gets appended to the id does it?
[13:41:35] <shoky> right.  you don't want to use ids for this
[13:41:54] <al_nz1> this is where I am going with this : http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/XaXB0
[13:42:20] <al_nz1> ultimately the form will allow you to add multiple groops of input boxes for each person you want to add
[13:42:33] <shoky> really bad idea to use id's here for all that
[13:42:37] <al_nz1> so iwi (ie tribe) could be on the form 4,5,6 seven times
[13:42:42] <shoky> it makes your code super messy and error-prone
[13:42:54] <al_nz1> but id needs to be uniquie right?
[13:43:07] <shoky> yes but that's irrelevant.
[13:43:16] <shoky> it doesn't need to be unique if there is no id :)
[13:43:21] <shoky> and you don't need an id
[13:44:17] <al_nz1> I think I need id's to get it into thymeleaf?
[13:44:49] <shoky> no idea what that is. but if it depends on id's then it's dumb :P
[13:46:24] <al_nz1> so how would you keep track of dynamically added fields?
[13:46:41] <al_nz1> data-iwi-num="0"
[13:46:51] <al_nz1> etc
[13:46:59] <shoky> what do you mean by keep track
[13:47:44] <al_nz1> so the person has entered name, address, phone for a person on a form then added another input group and added name2, address2, phone2 etc etc etc
[13:47:50] <shoky> btw in your code you are adding an event listener inside an eevnt listener
[13:47:55] <shoky> that's almost always a bad idea
[13:48:13] <shoky> you'll add multiple event listeners to the same buttons that way
[13:48:25] <al_nz1> which bit of code?
[13:48:32] <shoky> $('.remove-me').click(function(e){
[13:48:42] <shoky> that runs again each time the add-more is clicked
[13:48:48] <al_nz1> oh - that code - thats not my code
[13:48:50] <shoky> it'll run on previously added buttons to
[13:48:50] <al_nz1> but iok
[13:48:59] <shoky> this is all your code as far as i'm concerned :)
[13:49:08] <al_nz1> it was just a example of what I want to do
[13:49:24] <shoky> oks, it's bad code is all i'm saying ;p
[13:49:31] <al_nz1> :-)
[13:49:32] <al_nz1> so the person has entered name, address, phone for a person on a form then added another input group and added name2, address2, phone2 etc etc etc
[13:49:39] <shoky> yea?
[13:50:03] <al_nz1> so I need to be able to iterate over person[x] atsome point
[13:50:05] <shoky> if these are inputs that will get submitted to the server
[13:50:11] <al_nz1> yes
[13:50:14] <shoky> then it's the input _names_ that matter, not their ids
[13:50:27] <shoky> ids have nothing to do with forms/inputs
[13:50:48] <shoky> and i didn't say anything about not giving them names ;p
[13:51:53] <al_nz1> so name attribute like  <a name="C4">Chapter 4</a>
[13:52:07] <shoky> i was talking about input names
[13:52:13] <shoky> on <input> or <select>  only
[13:52:22] <shoky> the ones that get submitted in a form submit
[13:52:29] <al_nz1> example
[13:52:34] <shoky> if you're not doing a regular form submit then its not relevant
[13:52:57] <al_nz1> its regular post
[13:53:03] <shoky> well yes, that's a name attribute.. if that's what you were asking
[13:53:24] <shoky> but <a>'s don't get submitted ;p
[13:54:13] <al_nz1> so if it was a <select name="iwi" id="whatever">.........</select>
[14:28:17] <robertmaxrees> ohai
[14:28:43] <hlve> ohai
[14:32:10] <AlluringMe> Finally, some luck with ajax. Happy it makes me!! :O https://codeanywhere.com/s/l/705H6UGYqcvrUByZDt6xUbKkexKkotWJWb5GCeBjZ8zeXjxiEAeEQatnaFAJX6pE
[14:35:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:28] <robertmaxrees> don't use a service that requires me to log in.
[14:36:02] <hlve> why?
[14:36:09] <robertmaxrees> realy?
[14:36:19] <robertmaxrees> i should have to create an account to see code?
[14:36:19] <hlve> just curious
[14:36:30] <hlve> Oh to see code, no. I thought you meant in general lol
[14:36:37] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha
[14:36:38] <robertmaxrees> nah
[14:36:39] <hlve> lmao
[14:36:47] <hlve> I was like... uhhh...
[14:44:21] <AlluringMe> robertmaxrees, hi how are things. Sorry. It's irrelevant to jquery anyways. :) Sorry about that though. haha
[14:44:37] <AlluringMe> It was supposed to be posted on laravel. :)
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:45:24] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[14:45:41] <AlluringMe> Great to hear that. :D
[14:45:56] <robertmaxrees> well i mean it's not a big deal
[14:46:02] <robertmaxrees> my personal life is a shitshow right now but meh
[14:46:37] <AlluringMe> Same same. But, I'm gonna make it different. I must make it diff. lol
[14:47:26] <AlluringMe> Freaking can't even buy a Lamborghini yet. :-( :P
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:47:43] <robertmaxrees> my problems are much more "real world' but ok ;)
[14:48:00] <AlluringMe> I was kidding. Same here. Meeting ends meet.
[15:12:23] <hellyeah> yo
[15:14:39] <robertmaxrees> sup
[15:17:39] <arc_> i just found a random blog that prevents you from selecting anything on the page and also from using ctrl+f
[15:26:31] <hlve> assholes.
[15:26:33] <hlve> lol
[15:26:38] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:26:42] <hlve> Why would they prevent ctrl+f?
[15:26:55] <robertmaxrees> they probbaly didn't intend to.
[15:27:17] <hlve> i hate blogs that prevent selecting things on the page.
[15:27:19] <hlve> >_>
[15:27:32] <AwkwardCough> well some sites want to protect their content and make it harder to copy paste things and claim it as your own
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:28:02] <hlve> Sure, but taking away from native functionality just makes for bad usability
[15:29:00] <hellyeah> yo again
[15:40:55] <al_nz1> So why does : var count = $('select[name^=ethnicity]').length;
[15:41:14] <al_nz1> not count : <select class="selectpicker" name="ethnicity" id="ethnicity0" data-live-search="true" title="Choose" data-width="100%"
[15:42:24] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[15:42:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/gyfcdqxj/ al_nz1
[15:45:53] <al_nz1> hmmm
[15:47:15] <al_nz1> brilliant
[15:47:18] <al_nz1> its working
[15:49:11] <robertmaxrees> fwiw try giving it a class instead.
[15:52:07] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but I dont want to count all selectpickers
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:52:26] <al_nz1> only those that have an id=ethnicity[0-9]
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:52:38] <robertmaxrees> right, so you give those selects a class of ethnicity
[15:52:42] <robertmaxrees> and count those.
[15:52:45] <robertmaxrees> that's what classes are for.
[15:53:18] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: <SELECT class="selectpicker ethnicity" ...... ?
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:53:38] <al_nz1> mint
[15:55:03] <al_nz1> so if I am dynamically adding and removing multiple ethnicity boxes from my form, how do I mantain event listeners in my js/jquery?
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated event listener instead.
[15:55:41] <al_nz1> I will try google for a example unless you know a good one
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:56:58] <al_nz1> ta - reading
[16:28:41] <al_nz1> and the beat goes on
[16:29:05] <al_nz1> why would this : $( "#selectpicker ethnicity" ).on( "click", function(event) { .......
[16:29:10] <al_nz1> not fire for
[16:29:27] <al_nz1> this : <select class="selectpicker ethnicity" name="ethnicity" id="ethnicity0" data-live-search="true" title="Choose"
[16:29:37] <al_nz1> duh
[16:29:39] <al_nz1> dont worry
[16:29:43] <AlluringMe> #
[16:29:54] <al_nz1> i beat you to it :-)
[16:30:07] <taplar> ethnicity is a class
[16:30:17] <al_nz1> i beat you to it :-)
[16:31:47] <al_nz1> stil doesnt go though with $( ".selectpicker ethnicity" ).on( "click", function(event) {
[16:31:55] <taplar> ethnicity is a class
[16:32:14] <taplar> :|
[16:32:40] <taplar> and no space, it's not nested
[16:32:46] <taplar> .selectpicker.ethnicity
[16:33:17] <al_nz1> but I have select class="selectpicker ethnicity"
[16:33:27] <al_nz1> I want the jquery selector to work off that
[16:33:33] <taplar> i just gave you that
[16:34:01] <al_nz1> so if there is a space in thename in the class you join with dots?
[16:34:14] <taplar> a space in a selector is a nested selection
[16:34:26] <taplar> the first being the parent with following be children to the previous
[16:34:29] <al_nz1> ok
[16:34:34] <taplar> no space is a logical AND
[16:34:40] <taplar> the same as CSS
[16:34:51] <AlluringMe> O.O
[16:34:59] <AlluringMe> The one in between :P
[16:35:11] <taplar> hmm?
[16:35:28] <AlluringMe> LOL hi. I mean a dot right? XD
[16:35:30] <al_nz1> hmm
[16:35:33] <al_nz1> still not firing
[16:35:41] <taplar> no, a dot is just the class indicator
[16:35:57] <al_nz1> code: $( ".selectpicker.ethnicity" ).on( "click", function(event) {
[16:36:13] <taplar> console.log( $( ".selectpicker.ethnicity" ).length );
[16:36:51] <al_nz1> 1
[16:37:07] <taplar> then, whatever your doing is not triggering the click event
[16:37:16] <taplar> were did you run that console log?
[16:38:10] <taplar> make sure to stick it immediately before your on() call, if you did not
[16:39:49] <al_nz1> its inside doc ready
[16:39:54] <al_nz1> but i presume thats ok
[16:40:02] <taplar> not what i asked, :)
[16:40:32] <taplar> just ruling out that you didn't stick it in your browser console and run it
[16:41:19] <al_nz1> no i didnt. its in a js file
[16:41:53] <al_nz1> the first line inside the click event is a write a little message to console
[16:42:06] <al_nz1> but thats not firing when I click the select picker
[16:42:26] <taplar> right, and that console log of the length immediately before the binding prints out 1, right?
[16:42:37] <al_nz1> yes
[16:42:51] <taplar> ok, so there are a few possibilities
[16:43:39] <taplar> either your interaction is not generating the event, or your destroying the element and recreating it as part of your logic (which would destroy the binding too), or you have another event handler on the element that is cancelling the event before it is allowed to be processed by that one
[16:43:58] <al_nz1> ok. well there is not much in my js.....
[16:43:58] <taplar> can you recreate the issue in a fiddle?
[16:44:06] <al_nz1> lemme try
[16:45:44] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/
[16:46:27] <al_nz1> do I need to add a reference to jquery somewhere?
[16:46:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/1/ seems to work.  yes, i included it in the javascript <cog> label in the top right of the javascript section
[16:48:23] <al_nz1> yeah I added it in the js cog
[16:48:38] <al_nz1> but it says Reference error: $ is not defined
[16:49:12] <taplar> did you look at my fiddle?  i already fixed that
[16:50:54] <al_nz1> taplar: yes, but I would like to know how to add jquery to my jsfiddles. I added 2.4 in the cog and put it for body
[16:51:01] <al_nz1> but I still get reference error
[16:51:06] <taplar> you don't put it in the body
[16:51:10] <taplar> that cog takes care of all that
[16:51:37] <taplar> just select your version, if you don't have a doc ready change it to load in body, and re-run
[16:52:00] <al_nz1> ok, no reference error now : https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/4/
[16:52:05] <al_nz1> but its not firing the event
[16:52:20] <taplar> sure it is
[16:52:24] <taplar> why do you say it is not?
[16:53:42] <al_nz1> ok i see now
[16:53:44] <al_nz1> yes firing
[16:55:13] <al_nz1> taplar: this might be more revealing: https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/7/
[16:55:57] <taplar> select[id^=ethnicity] <-- use a class, avoid this if possible
[16:56:06] <al_nz1> taplar: I have it inside a document ready function. but and it complains that TypeError: $(....) selectpicker is not a function
[16:56:28] <al_nz1> taplar: yeah thats just play around code
[16:56:31] <taplar> iirc selectpicker is not a core jQuery method
[16:56:41] <taplar> perhaps a jquery ui method
[16:56:55] <al_nz1> selectpicker is part of my bootstrap selectpicker
[16:57:24] <taplar> so you'd have to include those source files (left hand side under External Resources) for it to not error
[16:57:47] <al_nz1> but its happy with select picker on its own
[16:57:56] <al_nz1> why does it error when i put it inside doc ready
[16:58:29] <taplar> i get the error in the fiddle with or without the doc ready
[16:58:37] <taplar> if a method is undefined, it's never going to be happy with it dude
[16:59:26] <al_nz1> no error here: https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/8/
[16:59:42] <taplar> where are you using selectpicker?
[17:00:39] <al_nz1> its in the html
[17:00:49] <taplar> huh?
[17:01:04] <taplar> there is no javascript logic in your html
[17:01:51] <al_nz1> ahh it was complaining about the other function
[17:03:10] <al_nz1> taplar: this is getting frustrating
[17:03:14] <al_nz1> it works in the fiddle
[17:03:19] <al_nz1> but not on my pc
[17:03:27] <taplar> any console errors?
[17:03:43] <al_nz1> only some google maps suff
[17:03:45] <al_nz1> stuff
[17:03:55] <taplar> any javascript errors can cause your scripts to stop running
[17:03:59] <taplar> fix your errors
[17:05:33] <al_nz1> ok i commented out the google stuff so now no error
[17:05:37] <al_nz1> but still not running
[17:06:04] <taplar> and your in a doc ready and the console log says 1 right before the bind
[17:06:12] <taplar> s/bind/on()
[17:06:27] <taplar> awww b-ot is gone
[17:06:53] <al_nz1> I havent go anything printing to console before the onclick event
[17:06:59] <al_nz1> did you want something in there?
[17:07:26] <taplar> i was reconfirming the console log of the length right before the on() being 1
[17:08:05] <al_nz1> taplar: I can share my screen if that works for you
[17:08:21] <al_nz1> man this is frustrating sometimes
[17:08:23] <al_nz1> :(
[17:08:29] <taplar> at work now so really can't do much stuff like that
[17:08:33] <al_nz1> k
[17:09:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/10/ <-- that prints a 1 on your pc?
[17:09:15] <taplar> (the version that is not working)
[17:10:16] <al_nz1> yes it does print a 1
[17:10:36] <taplar> ok, so do you have anything else in your scripts that are binding on that element?
[17:10:53] <al_nz1> yes
[17:10:55] <al_nz1> stdby
[17:11:13] <taplar> do they do an e.preventDefault() ?
[17:11:16] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/11/
[17:12:09] <taplar> why are you using a vanilla binding?
[17:12:14] <coder7of9> a div with a child div which is often loaded via ajax. best to place the parent on handler above the child div so i do not need to call init to set (the same) handlers in the child div each time it is repopulated? or better to set handlers on the direct parent of he child div and call init each time it is loaded.  (#'parentDiv).on('click',' 'menuParentDiv childmenuDivs') vs  (#'menuParentDiv).on('click','#cihldMenuDivs)
[17:13:00] <taplar> coder7of9: delegates are preferred typically
[17:13:22] <coder7of9> both options are delegates
[17:13:33] <coder7of9> one is higher up and removed
[17:13:45] <taplar> ah without the callback you threw me off
[17:13:52] <taplar> you want to delegate bind as low as possible
[17:16:01] <al_nz1> taplar: be right back
[17:23:57] <al_nz1> taplar: back
[17:24:03] <al_nz1> what do you mean by vanilla binding?
[17:24:20] <taplar> element.addEventListener
[17:27:26] <taplar> i do not think that is your issue, but it is very odd that you revert to vanilla there when your doing jQuery every where else, including inside that event handler
[17:27:30] <taplar> so question
[17:27:47] <taplar> when you click the dropdown that your expecting the event to fire from, do you see any console errors?
[17:33:48] <taplar> mmm, it looks like bootstrap-select hides the original select
[17:34:02] <taplar> when you click on what you think is the dropdown, it is not what you had bound to
[17:34:26] <taplar> at least that is what i am seeing, https://jsfiddle.net/z0ucxyyo/12/
[17:38:15] <al_nz1> taplar: no - no errors when i click
[17:38:18] <al_nz1> i see nothing
[17:38:33] <taplar> right, re-read what i just said
[17:40:56] <al_nz1> taplar: ok I am looking at your JS - but what am I looking for
[17:41:21] <taplar> on your page, right click on the "dropdown" you are clicking and inspect it
[17:41:40] <taplar> you should see that it is not the <select> you bound to, but actually a button element bootstrap-select is creating
[17:45:38] <al_nz1> taplar: i see. I would never have worked that out, but I guess i learnt a new way to see whats calling what
[17:46:25] <taplar> when you get a chance, give this site a gander: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:46:25] <al_nz1> taplar: I guess ultimately I actually want to find a way to show/hide another input field (iwi) based on the value of Ethnicity
[17:46:29] <taplar> should be benificial
[17:47:40] <taplar> in regards to that specific question: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/options/#events
[17:47:54] <taplar> there is a "changed.bs.select" event
[17:53:11] <al_nz1> yes. very good
[17:53:14] <al_nz1> but : $( ".selectpicker.ethnicity" ).on( "changed.bs.select", function(event) {
[17:53:20] <al_nz1> doesnt fire either
[17:53:21] <al_nz1> sigh
[17:53:32] <al_nz1> wait
[17:53:33] <al_nz1> it did
[17:53:36] <al_nz1> i take it back
[17:56:02] <al_nz1> you have been super helpful
[17:56:07] <al_nz1> thanks taplar!!!!
[17:56:49] <al_nz1> I am now going to try to get it to work as a delegated event (there are two Ethnicities currently on the page
[17:57:39] <al_nz1> taplar: so the question become will will it work as $( ".selectpicker.ethnicity" ).on( "changed.bs.select", "somethinghere" function(event) {
[17:57:56] <al_nz1> I mean : $( ".selectpicker.ethnicity" ).on( "changed.bs.select", "somethinghere", function(event) {
[17:58:23] <al_nz1> I guess I will need to change the .selectpicker.ethnicity too -
[17:58:58] <taplar> somethinghere would have to be a child
[17:59:08] <taplar> not sure that will work with the bs event
[17:59:21] <taplar> you'll probably have to bind higher
[17:59:40] <taplar> if you want to do the delegate option
[17:59:41] <al_nz1> can I pm you a link
[17:59:46] <taplar> sure
[17:59:52] <al_nz1> taplar: yeah bind higher
[18:00:16] <al_nz1> thats not the current version -i havent updated yet
[18:00:22] <al_nz1> might update now
[18:03:13] <al_nz1> ok it s udated
[18:04:45] <al_nz1> firebug looks good
[18:04:47] <taplar> the console has an error about google not being defined
[18:09:07] <al_nz1> taplar: yeah I commented out the CDN for google
[18:09:24] <al_nz1> I bookmarked that jquery debug site by the way...lotsa good stuff in there
[18:09:49] <taplar> yep, very handy
[18:10:04] <al_nz1> taplar: busy form eh
[18:10:19] <taplar> hey, looks important at least, :)
[18:11:19] <taplar> in any case i'd start off getting your binding with "changed.bs.select" to do what you want it to do for the other field.  then you can consider binding higher
[18:12:20] <al_nz1> both those ethnicities are within : <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
[18:12:59] <al_nz1> so I could try $( ".tab-pane.fade.in.active" ).on(....
[18:13:20] <taplar> can I ask what problem you're trying to solve by making it a delegate?
[18:14:01] <al_nz1> taplar: later on, there will be a "add" button to be able to add a new group of inputs for another person
[18:14:29] <taplar> with it's own group of ethnicity and such?
[18:14:36] <al_nz1> yes
[18:14:42] <taplar> gotcha, sounds reasonable
[18:15:12] <al_nz1> so I need a listener to watch ethnicity (however many there are) and then do something for the on change event for the current ethnicity
[18:15:27] <taplar> question, are the users always going to start off on this tab pane?
[18:16:02] <al_nz1> taplar: yes always start on pane 1. any extra people will actually be on the supplementary tab (second tab)
[18:16:09] <al_nz1> havent got there yet
[18:16:27] <al_nz1> but getting my head around the logic
[18:16:33] <taplar> the reason i ask is because you suggested you might could bind on "stuff.active"
[18:16:45] <taplar> which i'm guessing active is applied to whatever tab is open
[18:17:28] <taplar> so if on page load that tab is not active, and it can become active without a page load, then you potentially are not binding on it, or are binding on other things
[18:17:36] <taplar> so that selector might need some more thinking potentially
[18:18:49] <taplar> and it looks like that tab already has an id of "home" so it would probably be safer to bind to that
[18:21:29] <taplar> in any case i'm fixing to head out of here for the day.  hopefully others can pipe in if you still have question.  hope you have a good evening or whatever time of day your in currently, :)
[18:36:34] <al_nz1> taplar: thanks
[18:47:20] <al_nz1> so with event delegation, like $( "#whatever").on("click", "somethinghere", function().....
[18:47:24] <al_nz1> what can something here be?
[19:15:15] <al_nz1> ok this is hard
[19:15:18] <al_nz1> event delegation
[19:16:07] <al_nz1> anyone tell me what $("#somethinghere").on("click", "whathere", function....
[19:16:28] <al_nz1> what is "wherehere" - class? id? event? element?
[19:25:24] <shoky> a selector
[19:25:28] <shoky> any selector
[20:54:32] <dranve> Cork, thnx for today but i still didn't get it... what should i do here in order to "pause" it where i placed pause(); function https://paste.debian.net/866844/
[20:55:21] <dranve> sorry, this is right link https://paste.debian.net/866845/
[21:26:35] <coder7of9> best to use a higher parent div as a delegate for a child div which receives many updates via ajax or a delegate in the ajax div (closer to the target div) and unset / reset the delegates with each ajax call?   (higherParentdiv).on(click, ul#parentDiv li) and set once  vs  (ul#parentDiv).on(click,  li) and set / unset with each ajax call
[21:33:19] <D-rex> last night I was able to make post requests from javascript console to a localhost server.  After work come home fire up computer and post requests using jQuery.post no longer send request with data.  What might have changed?  I'm befuddled, restarting chrome and computer has no effect.
[23:48:02] <dranve> jquery sleeping :D
