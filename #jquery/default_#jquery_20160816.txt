[00:22:24] <Yithar> So I'm using getJSON like this to parse a JSON and get information, but it seems like I can't actually assign to global variables or something
[00:22:32] <Yithar> "$.getJSON('http://freegeoip.net/json/', function(geo_obj) {});"
[00:25:11] <Yithar> never mind. I figured out getJSON() is asynchronous. That would explain the console output from the function given to getJSON printing out after other stuff
[01:31:03] <MarkX> hi, how can i send multiple parameters to my callback function?
[01:32:41] <Cork> depends on from where
[01:33:43] <MarkX> https://developer.chrome.com/apps/serial#method-connect
[01:34:08] <MarkX> chrome.serial.connect(ports[x].path, { bitrate: 57600 }, onSerialConnect(ports[x]));
[01:34:28] <MarkX> that is how i tried to pass ports[x] but it said it wasn't defined
[01:34:45] <Cork> you can't have any arguments to the callback
[01:34:58] <Cork> that will execute it, not reference it
[01:35:18] <MarkX> okay so i have to have just           chrome.serial.connect(ports[x].path, { bitrate: 57600 }, onSerialConnect);
[01:35:31] <Cork> yes
[01:35:47] <MarkX> function onSerialConnect(connecInfo) {
[01:35:47] <MarkX>  console.log("connected"); }
[01:35:56] <Cork> if you convert onSerialConnect into an inline function you can just reference ports
[01:36:04] <MarkX> ohhhh i see
[01:36:10] <Cork> chrome.serial.connect(ports[x].path, { bitrate: 57600 }, function() { ports[x].path })
[01:36:15] <MarkX> is it more acceptable to do that?
[01:36:26] <Cork> acceptable?
[01:36:30] <MarkX> i mean what is the best practise for it
[01:36:42] <Cork> depends on your code structure
[01:36:45] <MarkX> would someone reading the JS say the inline function is ugly and should have been defined elsewhere
[01:36:54] <Cork> not really
[01:36:59] <MarkX> haha i don't even know what code structure is hahha
[01:37:09] <Cork> the biggest thing is that inline functions shouldn't be too big
[01:37:17] <MarkX> ah i see
[01:37:25] <Cork> but say for 4-10 lines, no it's fine
[01:37:46] <Cork> some test suites has problem with it
[01:37:48] <MarkX> okay so let's say it does get too big (which it's looking like right now). how can i pass my ports[x]
[01:37:50] <Cork> but ya, so it depends
[01:38:26] <Cork> chrome.serial.connect(ports[x].path, { bitrate: 57600 }, function(val1, val2, val3) { onSerialConnect(ports[x].path, val1, val2, val3) })
[01:38:36] <Cork> for example
[01:38:40] <Cork> there are other options
[01:38:45] <MarkX> ohhhh i see what you did there
[01:38:47] <Cork> so, again it depends on your code structure
[01:39:01] <MarkX> right right
[01:39:09] <MarkX> i like your example. looks pretty straight forward
[01:39:58] <MarkX> now one more thing, in my callback function i have it defined as function onSerialConnect(connecInfo) {},  for connecInfo, why don't i have to write function onSerialConnect(var connecInfo) {}
[01:40:29] <MarkX> i'm coming from C so that kind of confuses me. don't i have to declare and initialize?
[01:46:13] <Yithar> MarkX: Javascript is based on Scheme. I haven't actually used Scheme, but I've used OCaml. And in OCaml you don't have to specify variable types. The compiler will figure out the variable type based on how it's used.
[01:46:30] <MarkX> Yithar, okay cool. good to know
[02:21:18] * zilla 
[03:12:25] <VectorX> im on windows, trying to add <pre> tags to copied text, testing, https://jsfiddle.net/eg4sLcco/ console prints correct code with <pre> tags, but when i paste in system ie in a text editor or something the <pre> tags are missing
[03:17:15] <Cork> VectorX: (not sure about this) but it is most likely content type of the copy buffer
[03:17:33] <Cork> the origin creates a text/html buffer and a text/plain buffer
[03:17:45] <Cork> and when you paste in a textarea you get the text/plain buffer
[03:23:07] <VectorX> Cork i tried text/plain but still the same, im not sure how to fix it
[03:31:11] <VectorX> Cork ok got it working
[03:31:36] <VectorX> https://jsfiddle.net/eg4sLcco/1/
[03:47:13] <VectorX> if i have two chrome, windows side by side, if there a way i can click on and element say a double click, which will update something in the other browser page ?
[03:56:43] <slax0r> VectorX: I don't think you can do this with pure javascript
[03:56:55] <slax0r> you would have connect the two instances through a server of some sorts
[03:56:59] <slax0r> i.e. websockets
[03:57:09] <slax0r> but I might be wrong in this
[04:00:50] <VectorX> slax0r no thats fine, im sure you cannot for security reasons, but thought ill ask, just incase
[04:11:44] <Usman_> I want to talk to Ben Alman
[04:12:35] <Usman_> Ben the proxy server you have setup on your server is useful, guide us how t osetup same on our maches
[04:13:29] <Usman_> Machines*
[06:12:24] <diverdude> Hi there....i need the user to be able to browse the server in a specific directory (with subdirs) after files with a certain type of extension, and select multiple of these files....and have the full server path for each of these files returned to the client.....is there any control that can help me with that?
[07:21:53] <Cork> diverdude: you need to ask that question in a channel related with the server language / framework you use
[07:21:58] <Cork> cause js can't help you
[07:22:08] <Cork> (unless you use node.js)
[07:23:08] <TimLoal> When calling the constructor on a $.widget both _create and _init are called for each selected element
[07:23:16] <TimLoal> I want to seperate code for initialising the widget first run and code for setting up the widget instance
[07:23:26] <TimLoal> My instincts are to detect if the widget has been created and return
[07:23:48] <TimLoal> is this a good way / the best way?  if so what is the best way of detecting if the widget has already been created in the client?
[07:25:13] <Cork> TimLoal: that is already handled by the widget factory
[07:25:24] <Cork> i don't really understand what you want to separate
[07:25:54] <Cork> the init is called so you can initiate things for the widget
[07:26:10] <Cork> _create is called so you can create the elements and add classes as you need
[07:26:32] <Cork> if you want to separate showing the widget or something like that; just add a new method
[07:26:41] <TimLoal> there are things i want to do on the first run and instance specific stuff seperatly
[07:26:54] <Cork> you mean per page?
[07:27:39] <TimLoal> let me knock up a jsfiddle, because i experiance both running say for times is run on 4 selected elements
[07:29:37] <TimLoal> https://jsfiddle.net/2vhchfy8/  have a look in the log
[07:32:11] <TimLoal> ... i experiance both running say four times if run on 4 selected elements
[07:38:03] <TimLoal> yes first run per page
[07:41:45] <TimLoal> i'm not worried that the actual behaviour is diffrent from what the documentation suggests, as long as i can exit create if its already been run.
[07:42:42] <TimLoal> how can i detect _create has already been run other than setting a global value or something?
[07:46:56] <diverdude> Cork, but frontend is jquery
[07:47:42] <Cork> diverdude: jquery is a dom manipulation lib/framework it isn't a front end
[07:47:51] <TimLoal> diverdude whats up?
[07:48:29] <Cork> TimLoal: he wants a server file browser
[07:50:01] <Cork> TimLoal: _init and _create are suppose to be called for each element, as the instance is initiated for that element
[07:50:41] <slax0r> server file browser? turn on directory listing for specific directories
[07:50:44] <TimLoal> yes i've read that, but experimental evedence shows that not to be the case
[07:51:06] <Cork> TimLoal: it isn't?
[07:51:18] <Cork> i get one _create and one _init per element
[07:51:21] <Cork> just as expected
[07:51:30] <TimLoal> https://jsfiddle.net/fbun3Loc/
[07:51:50] <TimLoal> ahh thats not what i was expecting
[07:52:32] <TimLoal> ok
[07:53:42] <TimLoal> so back to my question how can i detect that the widget has been constructed within _create
[07:54:57] <Cork> TimLoal: _create will only ever be called when it isn't
[07:55:08] <Cork> _create will only be called the first time
[07:56:47] <decx> is it just me or is the widget factory stuff needlessly complicated?
[07:57:43] <Cork> decx: depends on if you want to make a widget or not
[07:57:58] <Cork> i find it quite nice if you want to build a widget or extend one
[08:00:24] <Cork> anyway
[08:00:26] <Cork> TimLoal: https://jsfiddle.net/2tnvdeog/
[08:00:38] <Cork> that should explain how the widget factory works
[08:00:49] <TimLoal> thers my confusion in a nutshell, _create will only be called the first time, i get one _create and one )init per element, but it should already be created. no?
[08:01:17] <Cork> TimLoal: check the link
[08:01:20] <Cork> it should explain it
[08:01:56] <TimLoal> i get 5 on both
[08:02:09] <Cork> uh...
[08:02:13] <Cork> in what browser?
[08:02:17] <TimLoal> FF
[08:02:24] <Cork> O_o
[08:02:42] <TimLoal> let me look in chrome
[08:02:57] <TimLoal> and opera
[08:04:07] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2tnvdeog/2/
[08:04:12] <Cork> the comments is what i see here
[08:04:13] <TimLoal> 5 on each in chrome
[08:04:16] <Cork> in both chrome and firefox
[08:05:18] <TimLoal> yes for each call
[08:05:33] <Cork> no, not for each call
[08:06:02] <Cork> first call results in 5 create AND 5 init
[08:06:11] <Cork> second call gets 5 init, but no create
[08:06:25] <Cork> third call gives 5 method calls, but none of the other
[08:06:36] <Cork> exactly as it is meant to be
[08:07:12] <TimLoal> ahh ok i see
[08:08:26] <TimLoal> ok my question, on the first call i want to bail from every _create after the 1st one,
[08:08:37] <Cork> uh, why?
[08:08:45] <Cork> you need to initiate each element
[08:08:59] <Cork> else you will only have a working widget in the first element in the selection
[08:09:02] <TimLoal> that will be done in _init
[08:09:07] <Cork> no
[08:09:11] <Cork> it should be done in _create
[08:12:17] <TimLoal> ok there is stuff i want to do only once, how can i detect it's already run and skip it in _create without setting a variable
[08:12:28] <Cork> ...
[08:12:42] <Cork> how many times to i have to answer that?
[08:12:47] <Cork> DO IT IN CREATE
[08:12:48] <TimLoal> i'm looking for if (!widget-exists) {}
[08:13:23] <Cork> if you mean a global shared state, just run it in a scope outside the widget
[08:13:46] <Cork> or have a function you call and it checks if it has cached the result or not
[08:14:02] <Cork> but no, widget doesn't have a shared execution state
[08:14:16] <Cork> cause that would depend on the selection and widget doesn't have that concept
[08:15:02] <TimLoal> thanks for helping to greatly clarify the documentation
[08:15:20] <Cork> it is stated in the documentation though...
[08:15:31] <TimLoal> i'll set a property on the widget and check for it
[08:15:45] <Cork> no you can't
[08:15:50] <Cork> the widget is per element
[08:15:55] <TimLoal> the documentation is quite think
[08:16:15] <Cork> TimLoal: what is it exactly you want to do?
[08:16:22] <Cork> you seam quite confused
[08:16:46] <Cork> (note what not how)
[08:17:13] <TimLoal> on some points yes i am and i'm greatful to be able to discuss it and is it slaying the confusion
[08:18:29] <TimLoal> one thing that i want to only do once, which is a bit of a hack in itself is 			$.fn.buildItem = this.buildItem;
[08:19:22] <Cork> uh
[08:19:26] <Cork> what?
[08:19:27] <TimLoal> lol
[08:19:42] <Cork> you shouldn't do that at all
[08:19:44] <Cork> ever
[08:20:03] <TimLoal> i'm learning so i'm going to do weird things
[08:20:16] <TimLoal> in the absence of better info i do what i can get working
[08:20:35] <Cork> TimLoal: that would mean you can ever only work with that specific set
[08:20:47] <Cork> as $().buildItem would reference that specific instance
[08:21:07] <Cork> just make a widget method, if that is what you want to have
[08:21:31] <Cork> then you call it with $().myWidget('buildItem', args)
[08:22:29] <TimLoal> right
[08:23:05] <TimLoal> that's been bugging me for a while
[08:25:13] <TimLoal> i see i'm thinking Too much in OO conventions
[08:25:59] <Cork> javascript is oo, just not class oriented
[08:26:10] <Cork> (it is prototype oriented)
[08:26:50] <TimLoal> yea i know :)
[08:28:40] <TimLoal> so _create is for things you want done once per instance and _init is for things you want done to re/set the state of the instance
[08:28:57] <Cork> no not really
[08:29:11] <Cork> init is called when you call the widget without calling other methods
[08:29:19] <Cork> it is a kind of fallback method
[08:29:52] <TimLoal> is it worth handeling?
[08:30:04] <Cork> when you need it, but you normally don't
[08:30:28] <TimLoal> hmm ok
[08:31:14] <TimLoal> so let me sort out that dodgy global function
[08:31:26] <TimLoal> thank you
[08:32:06] <TimLoal> i'm so glad i wrote a test case or i'd have never got it
[09:03:38] <TimLoal> cork: i wrote my test case to see how it handled multiple widgets and if i needed a     return $(this).each(function( i, rElement) { ... }); in _create
[09:04:07] <TimLoal> am i correct in thinking that this is already handled by $.widget ?
[09:04:31] <Cork> hmm not sure, give me a min
[09:05:07] <Cork> no that isn't correct at all
[09:05:15] <Cork> _create is executed once for each element
[09:05:20] <Cork> and this.element is the target element
[09:06:11] <TimLoal> so its already handled further up the chain and doing it in create is redundant?
[09:06:26] <Cork> check the testcase i gave you
[09:06:32] <TimLoal> ok
[09:06:32] <Cork> it should show you this
[09:06:41] <TimLoal> thanks
[09:06:48] <TimLoal> yes it does from memory
[09:07:30] <TimLoal> a big bit of confusion slayed right there ;)
[09:22:54] <TimLoal> i'm left with a small question mark around _init
[09:23:09] <TimLoal> init is a 'fallback' function that is called when no methods are passed, i've see this refered to as a instance reset
[09:23:17] <TimLoal> which is why i was thinking that state should be handled here, so that if reset is required it will be reset with the current state.
[09:23:26] <TimLoal> is this someone's good/not-so-good idea that i've read and should forget and explicitly refine a reset function if reset is required?
[09:25:53] <TimLoal> It would make sense to me to handle it by throwing an error or logging it at least, this would help detect bad code
[09:27:57] <MarkX> i have a pretty simple textarea that i'm updating with new lines of data that come in
[09:28:18] <MarkX> $("#boxOutput").change(function() { $("#boxOutput").scrollTop($('#boxOutput')[0].scrollHeight); });
[09:28:31] <MarkX> i'm using that but it doesnt seem to work.
[09:31:51] <MarkX> when i assign that to a button, it works fine
[09:31:53] <MarkX> any ideas?
[09:32:09] <MarkX> assign the .scrollTop i mean
[09:32:10] <TimLoal> markx first thing your gona get asked for is a http://jsfiddle.com example
[09:32:32] <TimLoal> out of context its almost meaningless
[09:32:49] <MarkX> hmm that site'snot working for me. let me try jsbin
[09:33:11] <TimLoal> sorry .net
[09:33:18] <TimLoal> markx first thing your gona get asked for is a http://jsfiddle.net example
[09:33:27] <MarkX> :)
[09:33:36] <MarkX> damn that's neat
[09:33:37] <MarkX> one sec
[09:34:47] <TimLoal> jsfiddle is better because it runs the code so can be better inspected
[09:37:04] <TimLoal> once you have finished your example, click fork on the toolbar and copy the new url.  do this any time you want to link to an updated version of your example
[09:37:18] <MarkX> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=mFq6vRnqKI
[09:37:24] <eva_> I'm getting an Uncaught TypeError error
[09:37:30] <eva_> Can someone take a look?
[09:37:31] <eva_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/df482cf36a00683e8c886e7d66be0a50
[09:37:35] <MarkX> oh i clicked the collaborate
[09:39:17] <MarkX> https://jsfiddle.net/qzxngrhk/
[09:39:37] <MarkX> add a couple of lines until there is a scroll bar in the textarea
[09:39:46] <MarkX> it should auto scroll down because of .chage
[09:39:49] <MarkX> .change*
[09:45:09] <taplar> MarkX: changing the value of an input logically does not encur a change event
[09:45:37] <MarkX> hmm i see
[09:45:47] <MarkX> is there a box i can use for strictly output?
[09:45:58] <MarkX> i just want to show a scrolling log of sorts
[09:46:16] <taplar> for development or productional use?
[09:46:41] <MarkX> development is fine
[09:46:51] <MarkX> if i can add in a nice fancy for for productional, why not
[09:46:53] <taplar> why not use your browser console?
[09:47:28] <MarkX> i was working with buttons and everything, i thought why not have everything in one window
[09:51:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qzxngrhk/2/
[09:53:07] <MarkX> ah
[09:53:17] <MarkX> you are scrolling to bottom after every time
[09:53:39] <taplar> effectively doing the change logic when logically changed
[09:53:52] <MarkX> right
[09:54:03] <taplar> s/logically/programatically
[09:54:03] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> effectively doing the change logic when programatically changed
[09:54:18] <MarkX> hmm do you know if there is a plugin or something that gives more of an outputbox
[09:54:19] <MarkX> ?
[09:54:29] <taplar> not off hand
[09:54:44] <taplar> what are you calling an 'outputbox' ?
[09:55:13] <MarkX> now that you mentioned production use, i'm thinking it would be kind of neat to have a window that resembles a console/terminal and just spits out data there
[09:55:28] <MarkX> data mostly being debug info
[09:55:51] <taplar> typically you don't debug in production. :/
[09:56:04] <taplar> but whatevs, :)
[09:56:20] <MarkX> hehe
[09:56:37] <MarkX> maybe i'm saying it wrong
[09:56:42] <MarkX> like a live log
[09:56:50] <MarkX> like running a program with verbosity
[09:58:08] <Cork> MarkX: the simplest solution might be to just use an <ul> + <li>s
[09:58:15] <Cork> it is how usually create rolling logs
[09:58:53] <Cork> it has the advantages that you easily can remove old log entries when you don't care about them
[09:59:24] <taplar> heh, especially if you put a timestamp on them as a data field
[09:59:24] <Cork> list.html(list.children.slice(-50))
[09:59:36] <Cork> * list.html(list.children().slice(-50))
[10:02:05] <MarkX> hmm that's not bad either
[10:02:11] <MarkX> okay i will try fiddling around with that as well
[10:39:23] <TimLoal> markx you have a bad call to your scroll statement.  If you call it after you modify the content it works
[10:39:29] <TimLoal> $("#addLine").click(function() {
[10:39:29] <TimLoal>   $("#boxOutput").val($("#boxOutput").val() + "\n" + "hi");
[10:39:29] <TimLoal>   $("#boxOutput")[0].scrollTop = $('#boxOutput')[0].scrollHeight;
[10:39:29] <TimLoal> });
[10:39:36] <Uhkis> please dont paste to irc.
[10:39:44] <TimLoal> sorry
[10:40:04] <MarkX> thanks TimLoal i appreciate it
[10:40:45] <TimLoal> youre welcome, took a bit of working out, but i learnt something too
[10:53:55] <taplar> lot of redundant lookups
[10:55:13] <karimcossutti> Hello everyone, would this be a good place/time to ask for help with someting?
[10:55:33] <taplar> any time
[10:55:48] <taplar> people will try to help if they are able
[10:57:00] <karimcossutti> ok, thanks! i appear to have trouble with the $.param() method, i'm trying to serialize an onbject and it's returning a string with empty array keys, i actually posted about this on stack overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38978194/jquery-param-not-serializing-object-correctly
[10:57:19] <TimLoal> taplar its a working example, based on his original code, if he wants to improve it cool, minimising redundant lookup wasn't the mission
[10:57:53] <taplar> always encourage improvements
[10:59:36] <TimLoal> tapla of course, but being perfect can get in the way of getting the job done
[11:00:13] <taplar> never said perfection
[11:00:38] <taplar> however encouraging practices that increase overhead are always a good idea
[11:00:52] <taplar> repetition drives home doing them as instinct
[11:01:02] <taplar> *decrease overhead
[11:02:10] <taplar> when it is second nature it isn't over optimizing
[11:02:24] <TimLoal> agreed, when doing something from scratch, but when debugging a simple example i'm not going to do twice the work again cleaning the code
[11:02:42] <taplar> to each his own, :)
[11:03:34] <taplar> don't expect someone not to say something though
[11:04:27] <TimLoal> i agree with you, but don't think rewriting an example for best practice when to fix the code took only a few key strokes is efficent
[11:08:24] <taplar> your assuming the purpose of the room is to provide a solution
[11:08:30] <taplar> when it is actually to teach
[11:09:39] <TimLoal> we'll end up on philosophy going down that road
[11:09:54] <taplar> no, that's not philosophy.  that's what the room is for
[11:09:55] <TimLoal> I aonly asume that this is a IRC channel with a topic of jQuery
[11:10:18] <taplar> you can ask any of the other main say peeps here what the room is for
[11:13:46] <TimLoal> and i'll get a diffrent answer from each
[11:13:52] <arc_> probably not
[11:14:00] <arc_> you seem very argumentative and defensive
[11:15:35] <TimLoal> sorry i helped someone, but because my help wasn't to best practice i feel like i have done something bad
[11:15:41] <arc_> no
[11:16:08] <arc_> the world isn't black and white. a single criticism doesn't mean that what you did went from good to bad
[11:16:40] <TimLoal> its like having mum around, your shoelaces are undone
[11:16:43] <arc_> also you don't have to do the work of optimizing, you could just say "this has redundant lookups. you probably want to store this in a variable"
[11:18:12] <TimLoal> i'm no expert myself and wasn't looking at that side of things, my head can only fit so much in
[11:18:19] <arc_> it's fine
[11:18:29] <arc_> that's what taplar is here for
[11:18:33] <taplar> phsss
[11:18:36] <TimLoal> lol
[11:19:04] <TimLoal> i should just paste my code in channel
[11:19:25] <arc_> i don't understand where you're coming from with that, but
[11:19:28] <TimLoal> thanks taplar i know you're on the good fight
[11:19:44] <taplar> just tryin, :)
[11:20:02] <taplar> and my real purpose here is to make puns arc_ .  *sniffle* it's like you don't know me at all
[11:20:13] <arc_> tru, sry
[11:20:44] <TimLoal> thats one bad thing with text, humor isnt always obvious
[11:21:50] <TimLoal> ok i only steped away from my code for a 'moment', lets get back to it brb
[12:32:55] <islalobo> We're using underscore js and trying to us _.indexBy() but getting Object {undefined: "]"} as a response
[12:33:03] <islalobo> Code snippet is here:
[12:33:29] <robertmaxrees> no response in #documentcloud ?
[12:34:01] <islalobo> http://kopy.io/fhHHi
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> islalobo setup a fiddle with actual data :)
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> and/or make sure the response isn't a string.
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> i still giggle when people ask for competing libs in here.
[12:39:58] <someb> Hi
[12:40:03] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:40:16] <someb> I have a question related to jquery plugin
[12:40:20] <someb> is it right place to ask?
[12:40:35] <robertmaxrees> you can ask.  whether or not we can help is a different question :)
[12:41:13] <someb> aha cool
[12:41:17] <someb> so I am using datatables
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> oh heh
[12:41:27] <someb> and it is making two server requests for some reason
[12:41:30] <someb> when it should be only
[12:41:31] <someb> 1
[12:41:37] <robertmaxrees> i'ma warn you that you'll likely have MUCH more luck with their forums for DT.
[12:41:58] <someb> I looked up the form
[12:42:13] <someb> and I suspect it is making one req to make the table and other to populate the data?
[12:42:14] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like help, a test case is usually the best place to start.
[12:42:39] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not going to guarantee that you'll get much help here :)
[12:44:02] <someb> robertmaxrees: aha okay
[12:44:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:44:08] <someb> robertmaxrees: any other place where I could?
[12:44:16] <robertmaxrees> i only know about their forum.
[12:44:16] <someb> any jquery or datatables specific channels?
[12:44:20] <someb> jquery plugin rather
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> this is the right place for jquery plugins
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> but DT is pretty big.
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> and they refuse to make an IRC channel.
[12:44:58] <someb> aha I see
[12:45:31] <robertmaxrees> you can try your luck here but just be aware you may or may not get lucky.
[12:51:19] <someb> robertmaxrees: gotcha
[12:51:20] <someb> thanks
[13:05:11] <z1haze_work> anyone here use/have used the parsley js validation plugin?
[13:05:38] <robertmaxrees> if you have any questions, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will.
[13:08:26] <z1haze_work> I have an issue where (somehow) users are submitting orders with incomplete addresses, and i believe it has to do with the form validation. Its like this: a user enters a billing address on the page, then has a checkbox if they want to use a different shipping address, but since that part of the portion is display none during page load, i think it
[13:08:26] <z1haze_work> doesnt get validated when it displays
[13:08:59] <z1haze_work> and i know, they shouldnt be relying on front end validation, but i didnt built it, im just trying to make a hotfix
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> sounds like things aren't being wired up correctly then.
[13:09:29] <z1haze_work> not really a security issue in this case, just a pain in the ass of not knowing where to send the package
[13:10:08] <robertmaxrees> showing/hiding the form shouldn't matter, but it's probably not getting initialized properly./
[13:11:53] <z1haze_work> its all part of the same form though
[13:12:45] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) not sure what you're expecting if we can't see the code.
[13:12:47] <taplar> some validators ignore hidden fields
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ some do.
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> others can be configured.
[13:13:13] <z1haze_work> yea
[13:13:24] <z1haze_work> thats the case here: becuse i force show that part on load and it validates fine
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> might be your config, though.
[13:13:54] <z1haze_work> wonder if i can just reinitialize the form validation/destroy it when that box is toggled?
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> http://parsleyjs.org/ "Parsley is now smarter, it automatically detects your forms' modifications and adapts its validation accordingly. Simply add, remove or edit fields, Parsley validation will follow!"
[13:14:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it should do that automatically for you.
[13:14:29] <z1haze_work> excluded: ':input[type=hidden], :input[readonly], :input[disabled], input.has-placeholder, :input:hidden:not(.bootstrap-select-rendered), :input.ignore', looks like that pick out the :hidden fields which is the sme as display:none right?
[13:14:39] <taplar> the magical spice
[13:14:48] <z1haze_work> yea they are probsably using the old stuff man
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> so update it and let the fixes flow :)
[13:15:13] <taplar> freshen your parsley
[13:15:18] <z1haze_work> hey i was meanign to ask if you dont mind sharing, your ecommerce site, what platform do they use
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> Depends on which part your on.
[13:15:42] <z1haze_work> O.o
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> *you're :) We're transitioning away from coldfusion and on to Node.
[13:16:09] <robertmaxrees> so you can go from one to the other relatively seamlessly.
[13:16:16] <z1haze_work> So its just some custom thing
[13:16:16] <z1haze_work> not magento or demandware or anything
[13:16:35] <robertmaxrees> we tried magento.  we have too many skus for the way it works.
[13:16:36] <taplar> idrk, not on their team.  but i may remember endeca being mentioned
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> and our sister company is on demandware.
[13:16:57] <robertmaxrees> but we're totally custom for our frontend.
[13:17:02] <z1haze_work> whats the shop? i just wana see work of the incredible robertmaxrees
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha build.com
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of sites in the network.
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> but that's the flagship
[13:17:31] <z1haze_work> i hate demandware, its a pita
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> it's actually pretty nice if you stay within the confines and love giving up money.
[13:18:08] <z1haze_work> the market has exploded
[13:18:12] <robertmaxrees> our sister company uses it and has had decent success.
[13:18:23] <z1haze_work> can double your salary in a year or less right now
[13:18:34] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:18:43] <z1haze_work> i mean, it runs like a well oiled machine, its just really complicated to do anything.. other than the basics
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> developers are starting to get cheaper.
[13:18:57] <taplar> so your saying, demandware is..... in high demand
[13:19:02] <z1haze_work> well right now they are still like 120k
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> i've heard some people say that and some people say the exact opposite.
[13:19:12] <z1haze_work> of course i am
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> 120k in what market?
[13:19:18] <z1haze_work> US
[13:19:26] <robertmaxrees> right, what market in the us?
[13:19:30] <z1haze_work> mid west
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> where?
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> chicago?
[13:19:39] <robertmaxrees> detroit?
[13:19:48] <z1haze_work> most of the high paying companies are remote only
[13:19:53] <z1haze_work> so anywhere i guess
[13:19:53] <z1haze_work> i thnk based east coast
[13:19:53] <taplar> it's going to vary depending on the area's col
[13:20:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not really very true z1haze_work
[13:20:08] <z1haze_work> friend just quit from here last month and moved out to LA though, so i dunno
[13:20:08] <robertmaxrees> some high paying companies are.
[13:20:12] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees:  its 100% tru
[13:20:13] <z1haze_work> true*
[13:20:28] <robertmaxrees> all the high paying places i know of what you local.
[13:20:46] <robertmaxrees> well, the majority of them at least.
[13:21:01] <z1haze_work> guy quit here a few months ago went from 70 to 120% remote
[13:21:01] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, taplar's point is salient - really depends on COL.
[13:21:05] <taplar> i know of one competitor that has all their peeps local, and their IT office is located in a place that allows them to offer very low salaries.
[13:21:10] <z1haze_work> working at media hive i believe its called
[13:21:21] <z1haze_work> another shop, called fluid is also a big one
[13:21:23] <taplar> they're an upscale competitor too
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> "high paying" is relative.  i'm relatively high paid but live in an area with low COL.
[13:21:28] <robertmaxrees> well, lower.
[13:21:41] <Uhkis> what's COL?
[13:21:44] <arc_> cost of living
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> cost of living.
[13:21:45] <z1haze_work> sure
[13:21:58] <robertmaxrees> doesn't make sense to pay somebody in san francisco the same as somebody in, say, chico
[13:22:02] <z1haze_work> the guy who moved to LA got a big raise from COL diff
[13:22:07] <z1haze_work> plus** not from
[13:22:32] <taplar> is it a raise if your forced to pay it out? ;)
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> lol i think he's saying it accounts for more than just the col diff.
[13:22:47] <z1haze_work> lol my point guys, is the demandware market is booming, and next year its gonna be super saturated
[13:22:55] <arc_> wtf is demandware : /
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> ecommerce platform.
[13:23:11] <robertmaxrees> and i would never get into demandware or any other specific platform like that.
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[13:23:16] <arc_> it sounds like that stuff that holds your computer hostage
[13:23:29] <z1haze_work> haha
[13:23:32] <arc_> ransomware, demandware, w/e
[13:23:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:39] <taplar> for servers
[13:23:44] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: currently yea, but theyve just transitioned into using controllers
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:23:54] <z1haze_work> so its goign to not be SO proprietary
[13:24:08] <robertmaxrees> that sentence makes no sense.
[13:24:15] <taplar> idk i guess demandware depends on how large of a it staff your company has
[13:24:20] <z1haze_work> all demandware code is proprietary, the whole script and backend calls, etc
[13:24:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:24:29] <z1haze_work> yea it does, its just not something you're used to
[13:24:39] <z1haze_work> let me show you
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[13:24:49] <z1haze_work> https://gyazo.com/3e42638c3b62098d70e529deecf4d292
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't see what this has to do with anything.
[13:25:23] <taplar> or wth it is
[13:25:37] <z1haze_work> you made a comment saying you wouldnt get into something this specific
[13:25:38] <z1haze_work> assuming because its niche, right?
[13:25:41] <robertmaxrees> it's a diagram of part of demandware's stack.
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> and no.
[13:26:16] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: thats how you 'code' the backend for demandware
[13:26:17] <z1haze_work> inside each box lies actual code
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> well, more like it pigeonholes you - i would never call myself a "demandware developer" for the same reason i'd never call myself a "wordpress developer" or "megento developer"
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work again - sister comnpany uses it.
[13:26:31] <z1haze_work> its terrible
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> familiar with the platform.
[13:27:00] <z1haze_work> so you've worked on it/
[13:27:12] <robertmaxrees> not directly, but i've seen bits and pieces of the platform.
[13:27:17] <robertmaxrees> i have a pretty decent idea of how it works.
[13:27:25] <z1haze_work> is build.com the one that uses the backbone stuff
[13:27:39] <robertmaxrees> for our new frontend, yes.
[13:27:54] <robertmaxrees> there's some ugly stuff we're working through right now.
[13:28:03] <taplar> can i ask, what lead to this convo?  we trying to convince people (not) to start working with demandware?
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea (shrug)
[13:28:58] <z1haze_work> just chit chat possibly?
[13:29:04] <z1haze_work> sorry to start that
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> just a weird convo heh
[13:29:13] <taplar> ah, ok.  just curious
[13:29:28] <taplar> i remembered the saturation comment so was wondering
[13:29:52] <z1haze_work> yea
[13:29:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:30:17] <z1haze_work> probably like any new craze
[13:31:35] <taplar> nothing wrong with that.  i know a guy who went freelance during the y2k area.  my brother in law did well in the oil bubble.
[13:34:46] <z1haze_work> so is 'set-cookie-agreement': function (){ just another way to define functions?
[13:35:30] <taplar> you can quote strings, sure
[13:35:52] <z1haze_work> woudl that not be the same as set-cookie-agreement: function() { ..
[13:35:57] <taplar> may have did that just incase the '-' tried to do something, which i don't think it would
[13:36:02] <taplar> probably
[13:36:47] <taplar> though i wonder if obj.set-cookie-agreement() would error
[13:36:51] <shoky> that's a property in an object literal, which happens to be a function
[13:37:41] <shoky> (and property names in object literals must be quoted if they're not regular var names)
[13:39:10] <z1haze_work> ok im trying to call a function in my global.js file but im not sure how do get to it.. http://dpaste.com/193ZE3B i want to call the function at the bottom
[13:39:15] <z1haze_work> sorry, not global, ready.js
[13:39:55] <z1haze_work> it would just be global.ready['form-auto-validation-parsley']();, yea?
[13:40:04] <shoky> global.init['form-auto-validation-parsley']   i guess?
[13:42:29] <taplar> is it a requirement that it has dashes in it?
[13:44:13] <NaN> I'm creating a team to aquire a team licence for a react videos serie tutorials (with author permission), any interested msg me
[13:45:42] <taplar> oh, are you making the tutorials?
[13:46:09] <arc_> he means he wants to pay for a license to view them that costs less per person
[13:46:29] <arc_> but requires x people to buy in
[13:47:06] <taplar> ah
[13:47:16] <taplar> the author permission threw me off
[13:47:53] <arc_> ya. i guess he got permission because buying a team license for all people who don't know each other and won't work together is a little weird :p
[13:48:02] <Clandesti> Hey guys, how do I reference a checkbox array in jQuery? EX. <input type="checkbox" name="type[All]" id="type[All]" checked onClick="typeCheck()">
[13:48:12] <Clandesti> if($("#type[All]").is(':checked')) alert("Checked");
[13:48:16] <Clandesti> that doesn't work
[13:48:30] <taplar> you have to escape the []
[13:48:44] <taplar> \[All\]
[13:48:49] <taplar> maybe \\, idr
[13:49:22] <taplar> [] is special in selectors for selecting by attributes
[13:50:00] <Clandesti> \\ worked. You guys are geniuses. Thank you for the help!!!
[13:50:17] <taplar> np
[13:50:56] <taplar> yeah, \\  makes sense.  you have to escape the escape first, lol
[13:51:13] <Clandesti> Yea that threw me, but it does make sense.
[13:51:40] <NaN> taplar: I notified the author that I would like to aquire his tutorials so if I gather a team it will make us a discount
[13:52:07] <taplar> i take it these are not like youtube vids
[13:52:28] <NaN> arc_: hehe yes, he will create all the acounts
[13:52:37] <taplar> i'd have figured facebook would have been all over tutorial vids
[13:53:00] <NaN> taplar: take a look >> https://reactforbeginners.com/
[13:54:00] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkGQAoc7bc :P
[13:54:00] <b-ot> (taplar) REACT JS TUTORIAL #1 - Reactjs Javascript Introduction & Workspace Setup - length 10m 19s - 973 likes, 30 dislikes (97.0%) - 182,741 views - LearnCode.academy on 2016.02.02
[13:59:29] <z1haze_work> still cant get this form the validate after its had hidden fields
[14:03:17] <z1haze_work> looks like the plugin automatically adds a class of 'parsley-validated' upon initialization but thatis not being added to the hidden form section, and even when it sshown and i reinitializeit, it doesnt add it
[14:08:50] <Clandesti> So one more question: if($("#type\\[All\\]").is(':checked')) $( "#type\\[Single Family\\]" ).prop( "checked", false );
[14:09:01] <Clandesti> It doesn't like the space. How can I work around that?
[14:09:21] <Clandesti> The space in [Single Family] I mean.
[14:09:47] <taplar> uh, id's can't have spaces
[14:10:06] <taplar> i believe that's part of the standard
[14:10:49] <Clandesti> I've inherited this code and it's working fine on the recieving page. $_REQUEST picks it up. I don't like it either but I don't know how much code I'll have to change in order to remove the space.
[14:11:20] <Clandesti> So I'd like to leave it unless there's no other way.
[14:11:34] <taplar> ids do not get sent to the back end.  the names do
[14:12:20] * taplar is trying to find the standard page
[14:12:45] <Clandesti> Good point! I'll change id and the name can stay the same. That won't break anything.
[14:13:01] <Clandesti> Thank you again. Very helpful!
[14:13:13] <taplar> sure
[14:19:45] <yottabyte> hey guys, does $.when() execute deferreds on order of passage? or do I have to use .then for that?
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees>  "in order of passage"?
[14:20:09] <yottabyte> defA.then(defB) vs $.when(defA, defB)
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> .when() just invokes its own then when all deferreds have resolved
[14:21:00] <yottabyte> but the order doesn't matter?
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> why would it?
[14:22:13] <yottabyte> I thought it was a convenience function for being apple to chain numerous ajax calls together, for example
[14:22:22] <yottabyte> if you need one to happen after another
[14:22:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not what $.when() is for.
[14:22:33] <yottabyte> but I guess I just have to chain multiple .then
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> $.when() simply runs when all supplied deferreds have resolved or rejected.
[14:23:04] <yottabyte> so .when is for if I have multiple promises to be fulfilled, and they are all mutually exclusive?
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> or they could rely on one another.
[14:23:33] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't really care about the relationship between them.
[14:23:55] <robertmaxrees> but if you need to execute some things in a particular order, you'd have to basiclaly chain your .then() calls.
[14:25:10] <yottabyte> how can they rely on each other if you don't know what order they'll be completed
[14:25:17] <yottabyte> (when using $.when)
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> $.when() doesn't care about any other relationships the deferreds might have.
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> all it sees is a bunch of deferreds.
[14:32:52] <yottabyte> I see
[14:33:02] <yottabyte> what do you call if? like if (something)
[14:33:17] <robertmaxrees> it's an if statement.
[14:33:29] <zzaichik1> or conditional statement
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> actually, the part in the parens is the conditional :)
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a conditional operator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[14:34:10] <MassDebates> hey robertmaxrees
[14:34:33] <zzaichik1> Nice
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> good morning MassDebates
[14:34:43] <yottabyte> is if an operator though?
[14:34:45] <robertmaxrees> so if is a statement :)
[14:34:50] <MassDebates> How are ya?
[14:35:04] <robertmaxrees> no, not an operator.
[14:35:14] <robertmaxrees> alright, MassDebates. how're you?
[14:35:52] <MassDebates> I'm doing swell, thanks. Got a question for ya.
[14:35:57] <MassDebates> Got some JSON. Object properties n whatnot have spaces in them. I want them to be non-breaking. How to?
[14:36:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:36:08] <robertmaxrees> show me an example in a fiddle.
[14:37:07] <yottabyte> oh it's a conjunction
[14:37:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:37:16] <robertmaxrees> if is a statement.
[14:37:21] <yottabyte> "if"
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:37:47] <robertmaxrees> when talking about linguistics.
[14:37:58] <yottabyte> because I see things like if() but usually I see that with functions, like myFunctionCall(). if, while, for, catch, case, etc have space before the spaces
[14:38:02] <yottabyte> ya linguistics
[14:38:04] <robertmaxrees> err, no.
[14:38:25] <yottabyte> reserved words
[14:38:31] <robertmaxrees> if in javascript is not a function - it's a statement that evaluates a condition.
[14:38:59] <robertmaxrees> it is also a reserved word.  but it's not a "conjunction" when talking about programming.
[14:39:32] <yottabyte> I see
[14:39:55] <yottabyte> so how do we promote if (conditonal) and for () vs if(conditional) and for() ?
[14:40:01] <yottabyte> in terms of style
[14:40:06] <robertmaxrees> if and for aren't functions.
[14:40:11] <yottabyte> what is the rationale
[14:40:13] <yottabyte> ah ok
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> though you shouldn't really need for statements.  if is pretty unnecessary these days, too.
[14:42:40] <yottabyte> use forEach?
[14:42:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:55:27] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees: you still there?
[14:55:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:55:39] <robertmaxrees> you can also just ask the channel :)
[14:55:56] <MassDebates> I like you better. :P
[14:56:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:56:06] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OXqWQE
[14:56:09] <robertmaxrees> still should just ask the channel.
[14:56:26] <MassDebates> I would if you were gone, dw. :P
[14:56:41] <MassDebates> So I dissected my work and made the width small enough to clear on "natural"
[14:57:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem we're looking at here?
[14:57:17] <robertmaxrees> something about spaces in property names?
[14:58:43] <MassDebates> yeah. I tore down what I had and gave everything a width of a couple em
[14:58:52] <MassDebates> How do I make the spaces not braek?
[14:58:52] <MassDebates> break*?
[14:59:12] <MassDebates> Look at Natural Colorations, for example. Natural is on a separate line from Colorations.
[14:59:20] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean from a CSS perspective.
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> not "break" and is "i get a js error"
[14:59:50] <MassDebates> nonbreaking spaces :P
[15:00:11] <robertmaxrees> you realize that 2em is relaly narrow, right?
[15:00:18] <robertmaxrees> like, 32px.
[15:00:20] <MassDebates> I just scrolled up and realized how that could've been interpreted!
[15:00:21] <robertmaxrees> *really
[15:00:35] <MassDebates> I set 2em to show what's a non-breaking space vs what is
[15:00:49] <MassDebates> the border is to show 2em
[15:00:58] <MassDebates> the box-shadow behind the content is a ruler
[15:01:01] <robertmaxrees> you can also use your dev tools :)
[15:01:02] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[15:01:14] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space
[15:01:32] <MassDebates> No no no, not that
[15:01:37] <robertmaxrees> yes that.
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> you want natural colorations to be on one line, right?
[15:02:37] <MassDebates> I originally wanted to have html entities (&nbsp;) serve as spacing because they're non-breaking spaces.
[15:02:47] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaaaaaaaaaay up
[15:02:52] <zzaichik> white-space seems like that's what you want, man. MassDebates
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> because you keep repeating the same thing and then rejecting solutions as not being what you want :)
[15:03:24] <zzaichik> Or so search and replace white space with &nbsp;
[15:03:32] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[15:03:37] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.  use CSS here.
[15:03:38] <MassDebates> Well that won't work
[15:03:42] <MassDebates> I was trying to come up with an alternative for the data.
[15:03:46] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[15:03:58] <MassDebates> Er, well,
[15:03:58] <MassDebates> there's really no problem
[15:04:08] <MassDebates> I'm trying to learn how to do something to learn how to do it
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> the right answer here is CSS.
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:04:35] <robertmaxrees> don't put character entities into your data - keep your data clean.
[15:04:42] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't know about where it's going to be used.
[15:04:52] <MassDebates> I know I could use CSS, but the goal of the question was to find out what I can put into JSON besides alphanumerics and dashes n stuff
[15:05:09] <robertmaxrees> you can put literally anything in JSON.
[15:05:11] <robertmaxrees> it's just data.
[15:05:20] <robertmaxrees> how you interpret that data is what you really want to know.
[15:05:24] <robertmaxrees> also: JSON is not JavaScript.
[15:05:35] <robertmaxrees> JSON accepts characters that JS doesn't.
[15:05:42] <MassDebates> It's object notation, right?
[15:05:51] <robertmaxrees> inspired by, yes.
[15:05:52] <robertmaxrees> http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> but different rules.
[15:05:57] <MassDebates> Ah
[15:06:01] <MassDebates> So if I wanted to do something like that
[15:06:06] <MassDebates> I'd have to do it in javascript
[15:06:07] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[15:06:26] <MassDebates> Like using entities for example, or special chars
[15:06:31] <MassDebates> and have their meanings retained.
[15:06:31] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't do that either way.
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[15:06:39] <robertmaxrees> use plain data.
[15:06:40] <MassDebates> I'd probably have to do it later in the script after pulling in the JSON data.
[15:06:47] <robertmaxrees> let css handle the presentation aspects.
[15:06:49] <MassDebates> No, don't worry, I won't do it.
[15:07:00] <robertmaxrees> so you wouldn't have the script modify any spaces or anything :)
[15:07:48] <MassDebates> Don't worry! I promise! When I set up the CSS I got to thinking how else I'd have to do it if that CSS ( or any variant with wrappers/containers/pseudos) wasn't available.
[15:07:59] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:08:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it would always be available.  so i wouldn't worry about it.
[15:08:07] <MassDebates> I went with whitespace originally; the same thing you've linked.
[15:08:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:08:36] <MassDebates> I just don't know enough about JSON and I find that I retain what I learn pretty well if I experiment or 'play'
[15:08:50] <MassDebates> er, not JSON
[15:08:51] <MassDebates> javascript in general
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:09:05] <MassDebates> For example, when I started learning SCSS/SASS
[15:09:07] <zzaichik> jquery is also separate from javascript
[15:09:15] <robertmaxrees> err, jquery IS javascript
[15:09:19] <zzaichik> I said that wrong
[15:09:24] <zzaichik> It's a library
[15:09:25] <robertmaxrees> it's a DOM abstraction library, but yeah.
[15:09:29] <MassDebates> I tried using it to make a new preprocessor of my own.
[15:09:48] <MassDebates> I'd never do that in a project or production code, but because I did that, I understand SCSS a lot better now.
[15:09:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:09:59] <robertmaxrees> how did you use a preprocessor to make a preprocessor?
[15:10:22] <MassDebates> Well, not alone lol
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> how do you use a preprocessor to help make a preprocessor?
[15:10:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused hahaha
[15:11:03] <MassDebates> I went ahead and created a parser/conversion tool thingy that sourced my scss experimentation files when I was learning how to use SCSS.
[15:11:22] <MassDebates> I knew that if I just settled for writing a few mixins and whatnot, I wouldn't be able to use it as well as I should be able to.
[15:11:32] <MassDebates> So I said "Well, let's try something there's no tutorial for"
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> "sourced"?
[15:11:41] <MassDebates> Took me a couple days to figure out, but I did.
[15:11:44] <robertmaxrees> lol i'm way lost.
[15:12:00] <MassDebates> oh, sorry
[15:12:05] <MassDebates> Basically I grabbed node.js
[15:12:34] <MassDebates> er, I did something similar to this: http://nicolasgallagher.com/custom-css-preprocessing/
[15:12:44] <robertmaxrees> so you wrote your own preprocessor?
[15:12:55] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, i get it.
[15:12:57] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:13:04] <MassDebates> Except I did it with different libraries.
[15:13:15] <robertmaxrees> sure.  so you learned what a preprocessor is.
[15:13:33] <MassDebates> Yeah I pretty much wrote my own. Wasn't happy with the syntax.
[15:13:33] <MassDebates> Figured it'd be a good project to learn with.
[15:13:37] <MassDebates> Exactly.
[15:13:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:14:22] <MassDebates> Much like when I learned how .ready() worked. I did it by making some elements in the <head> and some in the <body> to see if I can have jquery affect one over the other, and then the opposite vice-versa.
[15:14:35] <robertmaxrees> errr, heh.
[15:14:36] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[15:15:28] <MassDebates> It didn't work like I intended to work
[15:15:32] <MassDebates> But I learned by doing it
[15:15:41] <robertmaxrees> heh, because that's not really what it's meant to do.
[15:15:45] <robertmaxrees> but awesome.
[15:51:36] <Yepp> I started using vue with jquery. Trying to rewrite some parts to vue. I have a table being used with datatables. And I have button that is being rendered by datatables that has v-on:click="methodhere"
[15:51:40] <Yepp> it is not being triggered
[15:51:47] <Yepp> I am used to .on() of jQuery
[15:51:54] <Yepp> how do I do it in vue?
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay
[16:15:49] <Yepp> hey robertmaxrees o/
[16:16:21] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[16:17:12] <robertmaxrees> join #vue
[16:17:26] <robertmaxrees> join #vuejs
[16:17:30] <robertmaxrees> hahaha woops.
[16:17:51] <robertmaxrees> hey Yepp i might check out #vuejs with that question.
[16:18:21] <Yepp> #vuejs... lemme check that out
[16:21:57] <arc_> all those pages for stuff like react.js, vue, various other javascript libraries
[16:22:06] <arc_> are always so obviously written for people who are real programmers
[16:22:14] <robertmaxrees> "real programmers"?
[16:22:34] <arc_> like i'm kind of a programmer but i don't know enough to have any clue what 80% of the bullet points on the site even mean
[16:22:40] <zzaichik> I'm totally stealing that term
[16:22:41] <arc_> "Expressions & computed properties with transparent dependency tracking." sorry, what?
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[16:23:15] <zzaichik> reads like the book of the recently deceased, which read like stereo instructions
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> just means you specialize in a different area.
[16:23:25] <robertmaxrees> doesn't make you more or less of a real programmer.
[16:23:34] <arc_> i don't specialize in anything :D
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> heh, you know what i mean ;)
[16:23:54] <arc_> i just learn only enough to do the totally basic thing i'm doing and nothing more
[16:23:57] <zzaichik> everyone specializes in HTML I think
[16:24:12] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:24:20] <robertmaxrees> few people really know html.  same with css.
[16:24:30] <zzaichik> yeah, you're right.
[16:24:55] <zzaichik> to build a flexible, responsive site/page does take some research and training
[16:25:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.  our backend guys are terrible with anything frontend.
[16:46:35] <taplar> most the devs i know don't really know/do js
[16:46:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:46:45] <taplar> mostly backend guys
[16:47:15] <taplar> hell, you throw me down and make me do plain vanilla, heh, i'd panic a little
[20:28:01] <MarkX> http://pastebin.com/9J0qNAGz
[20:28:36] <MarkX> is it possible to predefine keys with default values so that when a new key gets added, even if it doesn't define a specific key, it has the default value already there?
[20:29:41] <MarkX> for example SET_PID doesn't use lengthIn but i would like it to at least have a default value of 0 rather than undefined
[20:37:20] <MarkX> nvm got it
[20:43:26] <TimLoal> i'm beginning to love JQ
[20:43:47] <TimLoal> still not fully deconfused, but getting there
[20:44:10] <TimLoal> thanks
[20:48:35] <TimLoal> quick question if anyones awake: i'm building a treeview and each node has its own properties.  I'm thinking to make a seperate widget node widget
[20:49:29] <TimLoal> is that overkill?  what does current best practice suggest for modular components?
[21:54:09] <whirledpress> Does anyone know of a jquery scrollable library that doesn't use a scroll bar, but uses arrows at either end that scrolls?
[22:10:05] <VectorX> trying to select a select option based on on value, this is not working for me $('#selectid option[text="D"]').attr('selected', true);
[22:10:12] <VectorX> guessing its not correct
[22:10:44] <taplar> $('#selectid option').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML === 'D' })
[22:11:12] <VectorX> ok
[22:12:53] <whirledpress> whenever you have a menu that has more items than can be displayed at one time, you have to put a button to scroll for more...hasn't someone automated this?
[22:27:20] <whirledpress> Would it be a terrible idea to have a hidden list of menu items (that contained the entire list) and a flexbox element that contained only a partial list of those menu items based on whether they fit or not
[22:27:46] <whirledpress> then you could remove items from the flexbox and add items to the flexbox to simulate scrolling through the list.
[22:56:26] <whirledpress> is $("elements").lt(num) no longer a jquery method?
[22:58:24] <whirledpress> aha...it's the $("elements:gt(num)") trick I was missing. LOL
[22:59:28] <whirledpress> There's got to be a better way to select a range of jquery elements...anybody?
[23:06:05] <dopie> hey all
[23:06:07] <dopie> can anyone help me
[23:06:09] <dopie> http://www.screencast.com/t/SEvuCnbai
[23:06:22] <dopie> I'm trying to fadeIn an image and then fadeout and then fadein another image
[23:06:33] <dopie> but for some reason jquery is doing them at the same time
[23:07:12] <dopie> I don't get it
[23:07:35] <whirledpress> You need to isolate the code you are using and paste it into a jsfiddle.net window.
[23:07:46] <whirledpress> then paste the url here and someone can look at it.
[23:08:09] <whirledpress> Without a working example of the problem, it could be anything.
[23:09:47] <whirledpress> Try this: $(".rotating-item").first().each(function () {
[23:10:06] <whirledpress> sry..I'll setup a fiddle for ya
[23:11:38] <dopie> ahhhhhh
[23:12:24] <dopie> if i  do that
[23:12:28] <dopie> it only shows the 1st one
[23:22:03] <dopie> whirledpress, any help ? :\
[23:22:40] <whirledpress> working on a fiddle for you
[23:23:14] <dopie> Ahhh thanks
[23:23:21] <dopie> I'm just not sure WHY it isn't working
[23:23:25] <dopie> since I have 2 objects
[23:23:49] <dopie> am i using the each function correctly
[23:27:18] <whirledpress> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/mEorGY?editors=1111
[23:28:20] <whirledpress> When you use .each() it applies to all of them immediately
[23:29:28] <whirledpress> you could use something like $("elems").each(function (i) { $(this).delay(4000*i).animate({opacity:1},3000,"linear",function () {$(this).hide();})});
[23:30:02] <whirledpress> that would set each item to delay 4 seconds time their index before animating
[23:31:38] <dopie> ok thats amazing for just a iterator
[23:31:39] <dopie> rofl
[23:31:57] <whirledpress> change line 2 to read $(this).delay(4000*i).fadeIn(2000).delay(6000*i).fadeOut(2000)
[23:32:33] <whirledpress> and change line 1 to read .each(function (i)
[23:34:36] <arc_> why are you timing it manually instead of using .done()
[23:37:43] <TimLoal> .done sounds great!
[23:39:11] <TimLoal> maybe the reality isn't as great as my tired mind triped out with
[23:39:21] <arc_> also whirledpress wrt your previous question, this is what you need https://api.jquery.com/slice/
[23:39:44] <dopie> whirledpress, i see what you did but for some reason the whole thing runs than it stays on #4 fading in and out
[23:39:56] <whirledpress> yeah. you need to use done
[23:40:23] <whirledpress> I haven't used fadein since 1.6 so I didn't realize they had it returning a promise. That's a lot easier.
[23:40:35] <whirledpress> I thought it was deprecated a long time ago.
[23:41:10] <dopie> man I'm looking at this code going WTF hahah
[23:54:56] <dopie> hmmmm how would i make it loop infinitely?
[23:56:52] <whirledpress> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/mEorGY?editors=1111
[23:58:12] <whirledpress> arc_, thanks
