[00:04:57] <jop008> how to set the heigth of a tr element
[00:05:08] <jop008> I want to make it fixed
[00:06:41] <Cork> jop008: you can't
[00:07:07] <Cork> tr is the the height of the td's inside it
[00:07:32] <Cork> or more specifically, it doens't have it's own height
[00:11:45] <jop008> So I cann not limit the heigth of a tr element?
[00:12:40] <Cork> no
[00:12:52] <Cork> just like you can't add overflow to tbody cross browsers
[00:13:43] <jop008> so If I limit the td td height I can arrange this
[00:13:49] <Cork> yes
[00:14:33] <goddard> how can i make it so my ui-icon class doesn't round out background images?
[00:15:56] <Cork> goddard: i'm quite sure ui-icon doesn't have border radious, that is a separate clas
[00:16:07] <Cork> *class
[00:16:50] <goddard> oh
[00:17:04] <Cork> ui-corner-* is the ones that adds that
[00:19:37] <goddard> here is what it looks like for me http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/vfjhR/2/
[00:19:43] <goddard> Cork: ^
[00:21:05] <Cork> uh...
[00:21:07] <goddard> sorry here http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/vfjhR/5/
[00:21:33] <goddard> there is like a background gradient added or something
[00:22:20] <Cork> oh
[00:22:22] <Cork> mobile
[00:22:33] <goddard> yeah sorry should of said that
[00:22:50] <Cork> ya, jquery.mobile has radius on ui-icon
[00:23:01] <Cork> border-radius: 9px;
[00:25:52] <goddard> Cork: awesome thanks
[00:25:59] <goddard> that worked perfect
[00:40:42] <kreeki> Hello guys, I have a question regarding cross domain ajax requests. Why is jQuery not triggering callbacks (then, complete etc.) on CORS requests? I have options like { dataType: 'json', crossDomain: true } and $.support.cors = true. Request goes to the server and returns 200 with correct data, but callbacks are not triggered (they are only when dataType: 'script'). Thanks for help.
[00:41:13] <kreeki> Browser is IE10 is thats matters.
[00:41:33] <Cork> kreeki: and the server sends the correct headers?
[00:42:07] <kreeki> Yes. Access-Control-Allow-Headers:Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization Access-Control-Allow-Methods:POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* Access-Control-Request-Method:*
[00:42:19] <Cork> (btw ie, doens't support cors through the normal XMLHttpRequest object, and last i checked jquery doesn't support XDomain)
[00:42:48] <Cork> ?g jquery XDomain bug
[00:43:00] <Cork> -_-
[00:43:15] <kreeki> I tried loading this right after jquery https://gist.github.com/michaelcox/2655118/raw/2fee9a700a9a9fd7fdb4582de9d8ae56ebcd179b/xdr.js
[00:44:14] <Cork> are you sending any data to the server for the request?
[00:45:11] <Cork> kreeki: XDomain doesn't allow you to set the normal form encoding, it only support text
[00:45:21] <kreeki> In get query params (in url), yes. The page is running basically locally.
[00:45:24] <Cork> so normally you need to special case those as the server parsers doesn't work
[00:46:49] <Cork> kreeki: ya, this is special with you do ie+cors+query=xdomain == special server code as it isn't www-form-urlencoded
[00:47:20] <kreeki> what do you mean by special server code?
[00:48:24] <Cork> kreeki: the normal $_GET, $_POST, params and similar doens't work
[00:48:45] <Cork> as the ajax isn't using the normal www-form-urlencoded encoding
[00:48:54] <Cork> so instead you need to parse the request body
[00:49:21] <Cork> and you need to do this is special code, as server languages don't do this by default normally
[00:49:31] <Cork> special code == you need to write it your self
[00:49:32] <kreeki> Well the strange thing form me is that I see the request in dev tools and I see the response, only callbacks are not called. I'm not sending anything in request body.
[00:50:10] <Cork> kreeki: if you arn't triggering the callbacks i suspect get blocked by the browser
[00:50:21] <Cork> * you get blocked
[00:52:07] <kreeki> I see, yea, thats possible. But I don't see any error, still there can be one only not showing too me (the site is running inside phonegap on my phone and I have only access through Weinre remote dev tools). Makes me sad. Already spent 10hrs on this issue
[00:52:57] <Cork> kreeki: not sure, i proxy my ie ajax calls when i need to go cors, cause if there stupid implementations
[00:53:48] <MissGeek> I've created an overlay with a form on top.. when the user clicks the overlay it closes.. but how do I stop it from closing if the user clicks on the form?
[00:54:24] <Cork> MissGeek: check if event.target is the form or a child of the form
[00:54:41] <Cork> $(event.target).closest('form').length > 0
[00:54:46] <Cork> for example
[00:55:11] <MissGeek> thanks, will give that a try
[00:59:31] <MissGeek> Cork: The value is 1 regardless of whether I click the overlay or the form?
[00:59:52] <Cork> MissGeek: shouldn't be if the overlay is the parent of the form
[01:00:39] <ooppa> How do I reaload Jquery currently in progress on page?
[01:01:32] <Cork> ooppa: what?
[01:01:42] <Cork> currently in progress?
[01:02:14] <kreeki> Cork: By proxying cors request you mean like iframe stuff? easyXDM? http://easyxdm.net/wp/
[01:02:32] <ooppa> If I have a jquery script that rolls text around on page how do I force it to start again
[01:02:46] <Cork> kreeki: no like i let ie make a local call, and the server makes the cors call
[01:03:03] <Cork> kreeki: basically i mean i don't do cors for ie
[01:03:23] <Cork> ooppa: that depends on the script
[01:03:49] <ooppa> Cork: How does that depend?
[01:04:00] <ooppa> Is there no Die(); command or something?
[01:04:19] <Cork> ooppa: you can't "reset" js, the js modifies the dom, and if you can start it over, the js has to have a way to do that
[01:04:38] <Cork> ooppa: jquery doesn't store the starting state of the page, so it can't generically do it
[01:05:09] <Cork> (and even trying to store that info would be stupid, cause it would demand a lot of memory)
[01:05:19] <kreeki> Cork: I see. One last thing, Is there a difference when page is running on a remote server and locally (file:// or some custom protocol, in my case its "x-wmapp0:/app/www/index.html")? It works great in browser, page on http://ds.dev and server on http://someotherdomain.com.
[01:05:46] <ooppa> JS is confusing, I simply can't finish my project <.<
[01:06:16] <Cork> kreeki: not sure about ie, but i know chrome and firefox becomes stricter when you run it locally (haven't played with the x-wapp0 protocol though)
[01:06:39] <Cork> ooppa: don't blame js, just look at the plugin your using for the spinner
[01:07:06] <ooppa> I have no idea what I should do :<
[01:07:17] <Cork> what are you using to do the animation?
[01:07:49] <ooppa> http://showcase.awkwardgroup.com/ this
[01:08:17] <ooppa> Script is in http://showcase.awkwardgroup.com/jquery.aw-showcase.js
[01:08:50] <Cork> ooppa: $('#showcase-navigation-button-0').click()
[01:09:20] <ooppa> What does that do?
[01:09:37] <Cork> it clicks the first button triggering the slideshow to jump to the first frame
[01:10:11] <ooppa> I need the script to reload the content from a another page containing the div elements
[01:10:23] <Cork> reload?
[01:10:25] <ooppa> and then start again, I tried load() but it
[01:10:29] <Cork> so you mean you need to change the content?
[01:10:35] <ooppa> Yeah! :P
[01:10:51] <Cork> well you prob need to replace the showcase and create it a new
[01:11:03] <Cork> unless it has support for replacing content
[01:11:18] <Cork> again read the documentation for the plugin
[01:11:28] <ooppa> Is it possible to load() it from a webpage and then reload it on the go?
[01:11:42] <Cork> there is no "reload"
[01:12:01] <Cork> the plugin might have a way to trigger it to update it's content, but you will have to look into the plugin about that
[01:12:07] <kreeki> Cork: One last thing, what dataType: 'script' is there for?
[01:12:27] <kreeki> Cork: Could it be somehow used to get json from the server? These requests are not blocked, but the statusCode on these requests is 404 even when server is returning 200 (and the jsomn)
[01:12:37] <Cork> kreeki: is there where?
[01:15:00] <kreeki> in jQuery :) $.ajax(url, { dataType: 'script' } ). This is meant to be used for the same thing as <script src=".."> right? Could it be tricked for getting json from the server? I really dont want to end up with JSONP.
[01:16:50] <nathanbbb> if i have a large number of elements and I want to show / hide them whats the best way to do it
[01:17:01] <nathanbbb> atm using show() and hide() just crashes on mobiles
[01:17:32] <ooppa> Cork: Is there a possibility that you could offer me a solution for the slider thing? A mod of somesorts
[01:17:47] <ooppa> Cork: or is it a big project? :S

[01:22:09] <ooppa> So Cork? :)
[01:26:05] <jop008> how to filter on textarea fields? I have this $(":textarea", form).filter('.required').each(function () {
[01:26:16] <jop008> but jquery doesn't like it
[01:26:39] <jop008> If I change textarea to input it is fine
[01:27:01] <jop008> I want to chenage the lable of the textarea field
[01:27:52] <ooppa> if I fetch JSON every 5 seconds does the slider react to it changing by changing the text?
[01:32:55] <jop008> like this   $('input[type=text], textarea').each(function () {
[01:37:21] <Cork> ooppa: no i don't have the time to code things for you
[01:37:28] <ooppa> Fair enough
[01:37:49] <ooppa> Thanks anyway :)
[02:25:10] <rethus> how can i access an input inside of an id with id=test. wasn't it $("#test input").val() ?
[02:25:43] <rethus> got, it, was a missspelling. :D
[02:34:51] <lemonsparrow> I am trying to click on an input element from firebug using it's Id but instead of the click triggering some event to happen (which happens otherwise when the user clicks on the element), I am just getting this in the console of firebug $("#queryField").click(); Object[input#queryField attribute value = ""]
[02:40:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: make sure $ is jquery and not the firebug built in function
[02:40:40] <Cork> jQuery("#queryField").click() should always work
[02:42:54] <lemonsparrow>     $search.append($('<img>').attr({   id: 'searchClose'     }).click(function(){   $(this).hide();  $('#queryField').animate({  width: '0px'    }).val('');  Cork
[02:43:07] <lemonsparrow>  this is my code in file and I am just doing $(#queryField).click() in firebug console but nothing happens
[02:43:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: try jQuery instead of $
[02:44:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: still no luck
[02:45:28] <Cork> and $('[id="queryField"').length === 1 ?
[02:45:35] <Cork> opps
[02:45:39] <Cork> * and $('[id="queryField"]').length === 1 ?
[02:47:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the code for those elements and related event it something like this
[02:47:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $('[id="queryField"]').length === 1  is true
[02:48:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: when user takes mouse towards that element to be clicked.. the mouse pointer changes from default to human hand..
[02:48:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and $search is #queryField?
[02:48:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: look here http://pastebin.com/miLg6VkA
[02:49:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork: remaned $search to $lookup
[02:50:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you don't ever add any event listener to queryField
[02:50:40] <Cork> you add one to the image tag before it, but not the input field (or it's parent)
[02:51:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok but even $(#lookupClose).click() in firebug doesn't propel any event :-/
[02:51:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so $('#lookupClose').click() should work
[02:52:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $("#lookupClose").click() in firebug console returns Object[img#searchClose /admin/a...lose.png]
[02:52:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: it does find the element but not triggering the event
[02:52:48] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so jQuery('#lookupClose').click() then
[02:53:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well or you arn't getting the effect you expect
[02:53:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the same result with jQuery('#lookupClose').click()
[02:53:31] <Cork> the indentation is a total mess in that op
[02:53:33] <Cork> *pb
[02:53:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: not getting the effect
[02:53:58] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[02:54:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork: as far as I know when user clicks the same element in webpage it works and then why is firebug not doing the same over the code jQuery('#lookupClose').click()
[02:54:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well as long as the click event for the image is what you want, and no other code is removing the listener it should work
[02:57:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the cursor here is pointer and not default.. so when hovering over the element before click the cursor changes from arrow to hand
[02:57:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could that be the reason why it isnt working in firebug for some reason #justAsking
[02:57:34] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that has nothing to do with the event listener
[02:57:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: mmm
[02:57:47] <Cork> that's just css
[02:57:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:00:42] <ooppa> Can anyone take a look at this and fix my snippet? http://pastebin.com/P9HcwRAS
[03:07:30] <ooppa> I changed it to $(this).load('/showcase').each(function(){ and now it says "undefined"
[03:17:31] <ooppa> Can anyone help me with this? => http://pastebin.com/4RaRMMGG
[03:19:33] <grafi> ?api load
[03:19:33] <b-ot> grafi: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[03:22:43] <ooppa>  Can anyone help me with this? => http://pastebin.com/4RaRMMGG
[03:25:02] <grafi> ooppa maybe try it like this http://pastebin.com/QQv7LVHq
[03:25:26] <grafi> i think the way you want it to work is not how load is supposed to be used
[03:27:04] <ooppa> I will try your code
[03:27:49] <grafi> it should at least make the html you fetched available to you, inside the success function
[03:30:01] <ooppa> Now it returns nothing :S (I ficed the typo in the ajax "/showecase")
[03:30:09] <ooppa> fixed*
[03:31:10] <grafi> try console.log(html) inside the success function do you see your html code then?
[03:31:29] <jonkristian_wrk> How can I target long_name for postal_code / postal_town separately? http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Kongens+Gate+19&sensor=false
[03:32:08] <ooppa> it returns the <li> code correctly
[03:32:42] <k_sze[work]> $.when is nice an all, e.g. to synchronize two ajax calls
[03:33:07] <k_sze[work]> but it returns a Promise object, which doesn't have resolve/reject methods.
[03:33:13] <ooppa> grafi: when i do console.log(pos); it returns nothing
[03:33:34] <Cork> jonkristian_wrk: var long_names = $.map(response.results, function(address) { $.map(address, function(cmp) { return cmp.long_name; }); });
[03:34:18] <k_sze[work]> So how do I effectively abort or cancel a Promise?
[03:34:34] <Cork> k_sze[work]: do it on the original promise object
[03:35:15] <grafi> ooppa looking at the html you should first change the ids to be classes, you cant have more than on id that has the same value!
[03:35:49] <ooppa> alright sec
[03:36:04] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, awesome, thanks:)
[03:37:59] <ooppa> grafi: like this? http://pastebin.com/vG4Uuq4G and then what?
[03:38:22] <ooppa> do I need to change the # to something else so it knows it is class and not ID?
[03:38:51] <grafi> http://pastebin.com/22dpjA6r ooppa like this, html already changed
[03:40:47] <ooppa> grafi: I did like what html log returns everything but the pos and content log don't return anything
[03:41:17] <ooppa> (also changed id to ide to fix possible confuses)
[03:42:05] <grafi> id to ide oO

[03:43:19] <eeezkil> click on `Open Dialog`
[03:43:38] <eeezkil> at some point the top position of the dialog gets doubled
[03:44:02] <lemonsparrow> how to get values  406,259 and 2,687 using javascript from this simple html table ? http://pastebin.com/F4sKiPaa
[03:44:03] <eeezkil> every time you attempt to move the dialog down
[03:44:25] <eeezkil> I guess that it's an event problem
[03:44:28] <eeezkil> any idea?
[03:47:38] <ooppa> grafi: I really don't know why it doesn't return the console things
[03:48:22] <grafi> have a live site to look at?
[03:48:45] <syntaqx> Morning.
[03:48:56] <ooppa> grafi: I don't personally own any host
[03:49:25] <ooppa> So nope :S
[03:49:37] <grafi> hm okay
[03:49:53] <grafi> let me put in some other logs
[03:51:04] <ooppa> grafi: Sure :)
[03:57:10] <SprkDev> This is my code which is working. I crops the image and saves it to a folder. But I want to replace that automatic cropping functionality with a jquery plugin code I found. http://pastebin.com/AMg0i5iK
[03:57:18] <SprkDev> Here is the jquery plugin I am trying to integrate into that code. But how? http://pastebin.com/g1TfQ0Hm
[03:57:24] <SprkDev> And this is part of the jquery plugin http://pastebin.com/XzY6N1vk
[03:58:26] <eeezkil> is this the right place to ask questions about jqueryui?
[03:58:40] <grafi> ooppa i just put it up on codepen, which lets you make ajax requests to other pens
[03:58:59] <jonkri> When I move between two divs (from A to B), the hover "enter" callback function of B is being called before the hover "leave" function on A. Is there something I can do about this?
[03:59:13] <j3lte> eeezkil, just fire the question
[03:59:22] <j3lte> maybe someone can help
[03:59:23] <eeezkil> fire in the hole
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> I'm using the dialog from jqueryui and everything works fine in a test page
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> when I try to use it elsewhere I get the same error as in this page
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> click on `Open Dialog`
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> at some point the top position of the dialog gets doubled
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> every time you attempt to move the dialog down
[03:59:24] <eeezkil> I guess that it's an event problem
[03:59:25] <eeezkil> any idea?
[03:59:53] <grafi> ooppa and it seems to work for me
[03:59:56] <jonkri> eeezkil: Enter is not a substitute for proper punctuation.
[04:00:01] <ooppa> lin?
[04:00:03] <ooppa> link?
[04:00:45] <eeezkil> jonkri: seems to work fine though.
[04:00:51] <mdev> jonkir you don't always use proper punctutation, let's be real :P
[04:01:25] <jonkri> mdev: I try to phrase my questions in one message when I can. Do you have any examples of when I havn't done so?
[04:01:58] <grafi> ooppa http://codepen.io/mstoppert/pen/abtye
[04:02:13] <grafi> console should echo the li and the correct id, content
[04:02:27] <mdev> jonkri, nope, but if you follow what you're saying, then I stand corrected
[04:02:44] <grafi> does for me at least, the html is here: http://codepen.io/mstoppert/pen/gliHt.html
[04:03:11] <ooppa> http://codepen.io/mstoppert/pen/gliHt.html
[04:03:19] <ooppa> Gonna see that
[04:04:23] <grafi> unfortunately that makes it even harder to find the problem on your side :/
[04:04:50] <jonkri> mdev: I think I do. And even if I do split sometimes, I don't split it into nine messages like eeezkil did above.
[04:04:56] <eeezkil> People are more concerned about punctuation and spelling than jquery/javascript/programing in general?
[04:04:58] <ooppa> grafi: That works on my computer too, but not in my code :S
[04:05:04] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, this worked for types where there is only one value, http://pastie.org/8389051 . Some types have two values, any way to match against either of them? http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Kongens%20gate%2019,%207012%20Trondheim,%20Norge&sensor=false
[04:05:11] <eeezkil> Refutation mastery ***
[04:05:33] <grafi> thats really strange ooppa, does your console give you any errors? what version of jquery do you use?
[04:05:34] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, probably not very elegant but it worked
[04:07:13] <Cork> if($.inArray("postal_code", this.types) !== -1)
[04:07:54] <ooppa> grafi: no errors, and I use v2.0.3
[04:08:17] <grafi> hm, quickly running out of ideas :P
[04:09:43] <jonkristian_wrk> Cork, nice! I should've searched for inArray, that would be how i'd do it with php, thanks!
[04:10:39] <seutje> ooppa: check when it's being executed (for $.ajax this usually isn't a problem though), check the network tab if the actual request is going through, check the response and especially the mime type returned by the server
[04:10:51] <ooppa> grafi: check if I have anything http://pastebin.com/1BdK6dJi
[04:11:00] <ooppa> seutje: alright
[04:11:39] <ooppa> mime is text/html
[04:11:58] <seutje> should be correct
[04:12:14] <grafi> also he can log the retrieved html inside the success
[04:12:20] <grafi> thats even more weird
[04:12:56] <seutje> so the problem could just be that sudoSlider call?
[04:13:08] <seutje> ?g sudoslider
[04:13:09] <b-ot> seutje: Sudo Slider | The most versatile jQuery content slider - Webbies.dk → http://webbies.dk/SudoSlider/
[04:13:41] <seutje> argh, no githubs and a zip download -_-
[04:13:54] <ooppa> seutje: want me to link the source?
[04:14:12] <seutje> I can sift it out of the demos
[04:14:23] <ooppa> Alright
[04:15:05] <ooppa> in html I have the id="slider" and I first to document ready where I define the slider with no slides then I do the function to add them
[04:15:07] <AxonetBE> Somebody has an idea why $("input[name][required]").length on the same page gives 58 in IE7 and 0 in FF?
[04:15:48] <ooppa> seutje and grafi
[04:15:57] <ooppa> http://pastebin.com/Z3E8n1XW
[04:16:36] <seutje> ooppa: that variable is scoped to that doc.rdy function
[04:16:56] <ooppa> Meaning?
[04:16:59] <seutje> either put the ajax call in the same anonymous function or pass it over a global namespace or something
[04:17:11] <seutje> it's not available to the ajax success handler
[04:17:23] <ooppa> How I do that? Can U link a pastebin?
[04:17:32] <seutje> it only exists withing that $(document).ready(function() { /*here*/ })
[04:18:14] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/pdhG2weM
[04:18:40] <seutje> weird that u don't get an error saying object undefined does not support the method insertSlide or something
[04:18:55] <grafi> true
[04:18:57] <grafi> oô
[04:19:04] <seutje> or a straight up sudoSlider is not defined
[04:19:09] <grafi> also it should log the first matches no?
[04:19:13] <ooppa> seutje: I still get only the log for whole html
[04:19:20] <grafi> and then stop when sudoSlider is undefined
[04:19:25] <seutje> or wait, the plugin exposes a global variable called sudoSlider, doesn't it?
[04:19:35] <seutje> so u just end up overriding that, maybe
[04:19:44] <ooppa> and no error still :P
[04:20:00] <grafi> very weird ^^
[04:20:41] <seutje> mm, doesn't expose a global
[04:20:46] <seutje> weird
[04:21:26] <ooppa> So What to do? :S
[04:22:23] <seutje> u got an unminified version of the plugin?
[04:22:33] <ooppa> Yeah
[04:22:44] <ooppa> jquery.sudoSlider.js
[04:23:14] <seutje> try manually calling it from the console, if that works, put a debugger; statement in the insertSlide method and step through it
[04:23:35] <seutje> then compare the flow and data of you manual call to the one originating from the ajax success handler
[04:23:39] <ooppa> ReferenceError: sudoSlider is not defined
[04:23:43] <seutje> ah
[04:24:10] <seutje> oh u just tried sudoSlider.insertSlide() from the console. didn't u?
[04:24:16] <ooppa> Yeah
[04:24:39] <seutje> like I said before, it only exists within the document ready function, unless you explicitly let it out
[04:24:48] <ooppa> How do I let it out? :P
[04:25:11] <seutje> so either redefine it from ur console (in the same way as from the script), or temporarily change it from var sudoSlider = ... to window.sudoSlider = ...
[04:25:20] <seutje> (and refresh_
[04:25:51] <ooppa> seutje: Can I just take the document ready away from the beginning of the function?
[04:26:10] <ooppa> I'm planning to later add a automatic slide remover. Would make that easier
[04:26:43] <seutje> you probably don't need a document ready function, but it's good to have some sort of function wrapper to keep ur scope in check
[04:26:57] <seutje> only leak things (obviously) intentionally
[04:27:19] <ooppa> seutje: Ok, so how do I "leak" it then?
[04:27:21] <seutje> u could just remove the "var" and make it global, but u don't want it global on production, this is just for debugging means
[04:27:38] <seutje> ooppa: window.sudoSlider = ...
[04:28:36] <ooppa> seutje: can u place me a pastebin about that on my existing code? :)
[04:28:38] <seutje> I tend to namespace it like window.appName.componentName.sudoSlider = ... so it's still somewhat managable on larger projects
[04:30:01] <seutje> sure http://pastebin.com/u2PNXjxK
[04:32:30] <ooppa> seutje: So it still ain't working with the logs?
[04:32:41] <seutje> what?
[04:32:58] <seutje> I'm confused, shouldn't I be asking you? o.O
[04:33:11] <seutje> I'm just trying to help you debug it
[04:33:23] <ooppa> seutje: No no :D You misunderstood
[04:34:20] <ooppa> seutje: I copy and pasted that and it doesn't still puke out the data on the logs
[04:35:07] <seutje> ooppa: but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:35:33] <ooppa> sudoSlider.insertSlide(content, pos, 'whatever'); ===> ReferenceError: content is not defined
[04:36:31] <seutje> lol
[04:36:35] <seutje> just put random shit in there
[04:36:50] <ooppa> ReferenceError: fgdfgfdgfg is not defined
[04:36:56] <seutje> really?
[04:37:04] <seutje> quote ur strings
[04:37:14] <ooppa> What starings?
[04:37:31] <ooppa> https://db.tt/gjiiCLu7
[04:38:29] <ooppa> strings*
[04:38:40] <seutje> js>  try { print(fgdfgfdgfg) } catch(e) { print(e.message);}
[04:39:19] <seutje> `down ideone.com
[04:39:19] <b-ot> seutje: It's just you. http://ideone.com is up! (200 OK)
[04:39:23] <ooppa> that works
[04:39:46] <seutje> ooppa: basically fgdfgfdgfg is a variable name, which is undefined
[04:39:49] <seutje> 'fgdfgfdgfg' is a string
[04:40:08] <ooppa> 'string' returns "string"
[04:40:40] <seutje> I think I just lost hope :(
[04:40:48] <b-ot> seutje: fgdfgfdgfg is not defined
[04:41:03] <seutje> js>  try { print('fgdfgfdgfg') } catch(e) { print(e.message);}
[04:41:13] <b-ot> seutje: fgdfgfdgfg
[04:41:18] <seutje> do u see the difference?
[04:42:05] <ooppa> It open my printer
[04:45:50] <dytrivedi> sup ooppa
[04:46:23] <ooppa> seutje: I got you!
[04:46:40] <ooppa> https://db.tt/ctzE14mF
[04:46:59] <ooppa> I'm so happy :D
[04:47:38] <dytrivedi> happiness has to come from inside
[04:47:56] <dytrivedi> when one merges with the universal, happiness is just there
[04:48:15] <seutje> to nirvana, and beyond!
[04:48:24] <ooppa> seutje: Did you look at the link?
[04:48:25] <dytrivedi> ^^
[04:48:53] <seutje> ooppa: yeah
[04:50:34] <ooppa> So umm? Any ideas?
[04:51:37] <ooppa> but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:51:38] <ooppa> but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:51:38] <ooppa> but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:51:42] <ooppa> but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:51:43] <ooppa> but calling it from the console still doesn't result in the slide being added?
[04:51:48] <ooppa> oop
[04:51:57] <ooppa> Damn IRC... sorry
[04:52:06] <ooppa> So it doesn't add
[04:52:55] <seutje> I was kinda hoping it would, cause that would mean it wasn't being called properly from the ajax handler and then u'd have a disparity to debug
[04:53:13] <seutje> but it just looks like ur calling the plugin as it is documented...
[04:53:37] <ooppa> Hmmmm :/
[04:53:53] <seutje> so either the plugin is broken, or ur calling it on an element that just doesn't exist
[04:54:04] <seutje> most plugins will silently fail then
[04:54:55] <rethus> i have such anker:
[04:55:14] <ooppa> it works if I put the content I get from /showcase inside the div
[04:55:32] <rethus> <a onclick="bookItNow('add/uenc/')" href="javascript:void(0);" id="scriptbuynow-1" class="button-glossy  booknow_btn">Jetzt Buchen! </a>
[04:56:09] <seutje> wow, this is the closest it has to an issue queue: http://webbies.dk/SudoSlider/help/ask-me/
[04:56:26] <rethus> is there a way to prevent the onclick from fireing, before my own jquery-script is finished?
[04:56:55] <seutje> rethus: strip the attribute
[04:57:26] <rethus> seutje: yes, good idea.
[04:57:28] <ooppa> what if the .find() fails?
[04:57:51] <seutje> ooppa: then it wouldn't log
[04:58:08] <seutje> as that is called once for every li it finds
[04:58:25] <ooppa> well, the html log is before the .find()
[04:58:38] <rethus> seutje: but, doses my $jq('#cart a').click(function(e) { is fired first, or this onclick?
[04:59:16] <rethus> cause the anker are post-loaded via ajax
[04:59:50] <rethus> but wait, i could use mouseover. It is everytime before click
[04:59:52] <seutje> the onclick iirc
[05:01:06] <seutje> rethus: u could use the global ajax success handler to parse whatever was inserted, but it's annoying to find out what was inserted that way
[05:01:13] <ooppa> seutje: "then it woudln't log" < It doesn't log
[05:01:19] <seutje> ideally, you'd have ur ajax thingymajig fire an event
[05:01:36] <seutje> ooppa: the console call shouldn't log, I'm talking about the implementation in ur script
[05:02:02] <ooppa> seutje: ah I see
[05:02:38] <ooppa> seutje: Here is the thing I'm doing http://webbies.dk/assets/files/SudoSlider/package/demos/methods%20inserting%20and%20removing%20slides.html
[05:02:59] <seutje> I know, sifted through the demos earlier
[05:03:14] <ooppa> seutje: Alright
[05:03:21] <seutje> funny things happen when u pass "foo" to pos btw
[05:06:12] <ooppa> seutje: Should I set the ID based on JS and not the dataz
[05:06:32] <ooppa> like 1 for first, etc
[05:07:02] <seutje> what ID?
[05:07:04] <seutje> the pos thing?
[05:07:07] <ooppa> Yeah
[05:07:14] <seutje> doesn't matter, enter a NaN variable and it'll append at the front
[05:07:17] <seutje> or... should
[05:07:41] <seutje> just type "foo" in every field on the demo
[05:08:34] <AxonetBE> this returns me 1 in IE7, any idea why? http://jsfiddle.net/xXunp/
[05:08:40] <jonkri> eeezkil: I don't care that much about punctuation (even though it makes the channel harder to read). But I care even less about your problem.
[05:10:37] <ooppa> I'v tried this since saturday, :D
[05:10:48] <seutje> AxonetBE: try logging the value for the required attribute
[05:10:55] <xinming> What is the right command to append the innerHTML to anther node?   For now, I'm trying something like,  $($('#node1').html()).appendTo('#node2');
[05:11:05] <seutje> ie7 might have it implied on "false" or some shit
[05:11:07] <xinming> is there a shortcut?
[05:11:29] <ooppa> atleast my .load() returned the "undefined" things
[05:12:36] <Cork> xinming: xinming well you could do something like $('#node1').children().clone().appendTo('node2')
[05:12:54] <Cork> xinming: though that will only work if you don't have any textnodes in #node1
[05:13:04] <seutje> AxonetBE: nevermind, I'm a moron
[05:13:29] <AxonetBE> seutje: no other solution?
[05:14:06] <ooppa> I
[05:14:23] <ooppa> I'm sure it doesn't do $(html).find('li').each(function() { correctly or not at all
[05:14:50] <ooppa> seutje: is  $(html). part right?
[05:15:01] <seutje> AxonetBE: weird, this says it's fixed in 1.7  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5637
[05:15:25] <seutje> ooppa: sure, ur just pouring the return data in a jquery object
[05:15:30] <seutje> as HTML
[05:15:46] <seutje> but again, if that didn't work, it wouldn't be logging parts of it
[05:16:16] <Cork> seutje: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-htmlstring-versus-jquery-selectorstring
[05:16:33] <ooppa> seutje: Does $(this).find('.ide').text(); work then+
[05:17:21] <seutje> Cork: I know, but when calling .find('...').text() on it, it returns text
[05:17:39] <seutje> which leads me to conclude the html is being parsed properly
[05:17:52] <Cork> try $($.parseHTML(html)) just to be sure
[05:18:59] <ooppa> oki
[05:19:39] <ooppa> nothing
[05:19:59] <ooppa> When I did 	
[05:20:00] <ooppa> sudoSlider.insertSlide('content', 'pos', 'numericText');
[05:20:06] <ooppa> I got "undefined"
[05:20:27] <ooppa> and when I used load() it returned undefined to the slider too, now it does nothing
[05:24:41] <ooppa> seutje: If i put sudoSlider.insertSlide('', '', ''); to console. What should happen?
[05:28:09] <xqo> how can i give a <input> field the have the required attribute with jquery? <input required>
[05:28:46] <Cork> xqo: rephrase that please, the sentence doesn't make sense
[05:29:19] <xqo> Cork i want my <input name="a"> to become <input "a" required> by using jquery
[05:29:30] <xqo> but .attr("required","") doesnt seem to work
[05:30:08] <Cork> xqo: $('[name="a"]').prop('required', true)
[05:30:25] <Cork> or attr('required', 'required')
[05:30:53] <xqo> can i do it to several selected fields at the same time, or do i need to use .each?
[05:31:20] <Cork> yes
[05:31:23] <Cork> :)
[05:31:29] <Cork> xqo: $('input').prop('required', true)
[05:31:34] <xqo> thank you
[05:32:02] <xqo> to remove the required attr, i use $("input").removeAttr("required"); ?
[05:33:23] <Cork> prop('required', false)
[05:33:36] <Cork> but yes removeAttr would work too
[05:33:58] <ooppa> seutje: why does it return "undefined"?
[05:34:04] <xqo> should i use .prop instead of .attr generally? what is the difference?
[05:34:22] <ooppa> seutje: When I do the command after leaking it return undefined
[05:40:34] <DRSK> if I give the selector a context will it be faster? E.g. $( '.class', el ) vs. $( '.class' ); ?
[05:41:04] <DRSK> whereas the former will select .class within el vs. the latter where it'd search for "all" .class?
[05:43:25] <PhonicUK> Does jquery have something like .serializeArray() that returns an object instead of an array of KVPs?
[05:46:26] <seutje> ooppa: because the plugin doesn't return anything, I guess
[05:46:29] <seutje> seems by design
[05:46:41] <seutje> `g jquery attr vs prop
[05:46:42] <b-ot> seutje: javascript - jQuery attr vs prop? - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13247058/jquery-attr-vs-prop
[05:47:41] <seutje> xqo: http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[05:48:05] <seutje> TL;DR: it depends if u want to get/set an attribute or a property
[05:49:11] <seutje> most attributes translate to a property, but not always 1 to 1
[05:49:38] <seutje> for instance, tables can have an attribute "cellpadding" but the property they set is cellPadding
[05:50:21] <seutje> this becomes important for boolean attributes (like disabled)
[05:50:49] <seutje> $('.foo').attr('disabled'); // might return 'disabled', might return 'true', doesn't rly matter
[05:51:03] <seutje> $('foo').prop('disabled'); // will always return true or false
[05:51:04] <ooppa> Anyone knows why this would return "undefined"?  $(this).find('.content').text();
[05:51:28] <seutje> (I didn't intentionally change the selector between those 2 examples)
[05:51:41] <seutje> xqo: does that make it somewhat clear?
[05:52:27] <rethus> how can i save a function-call in a var end execute it? Only with eval?
[05:53:03] <xqo> seutje yes, thank you
[05:54:29] <seutje> rethus: like memoize it?
[05:55:54] <xqo> what event does .ready() check for?
[05:56:07] <xqo> i want to use .bind("ready") instead of .ready(), but i dont know what event to use
[05:56:18] <seutje> it's not a real event
[05:56:28] <ooppa> seutje: It works IF i put the data there like this pos = 1; and content = 'string';
[05:56:53] <seutje> ooppa: so it really has to be an integer?
[05:57:16] <ooppa> No idea, but the thing is that
[05:57:22] <rethus>  seutje: yes, i got the function-call from a A-Tag while mouseover, than i strip it, do my jquery-stuff, and want to call the striped function (which i've saved before as string)
[05:57:29] <ooppa> $(this).find('.content').val(); returns blank or something
[05:57:51] <ooppa> and $(this).find('.content').text(); too
[05:59:22] <seutje> xqo: document rdy is sort of a hack, it kinda polls for the DOM to be ready at quick intervals and fires that "event" when it's done
[05:59:31] <xqo> seutje okej, thank you
[05:59:52] <seutje> xqo: u could use $(document).on('ready', ... but that won't fire when the DOM was already ready when u tried to bind it
[06:00:10] <seutje> whereas $(document).ready() will fire immediately if the DOM was already ready
[06:00:10] <xqo> seutje its ok, ill just use. ready()
[06:02:34] <xinming> http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/   <--- Anyone here can tell me what is the right way to extract the contents in a script tag with type text/html and insert them into normal dom directly please?
[06:04:20] <xqo> when i .prop on <input> i get give TypeError: http://bpaste.net/show/8YNUE30DHMP6Q5MSru4l/
[06:05:08] <PhonicUK> xinming, I don't think you can do that
[06:05:17] <PhonicUK> putting HTML inside a script tag like that
[06:05:36] <xinming> PhonicUK: Why?
[06:05:39] <PhonicUK> wait, you can
[06:05:40] <PhonicUK> hmm
[06:05:47] <xinming> PhonicUK: As I saw some examples on other people's site
[06:05:59] <xinming> who are doing this by setting type="text/html"
[06:06:15] <xinming> but when I try to do it within jquery, It seems jquery tries to execute the text within it
[06:06:20] <rethus> seutje: any idea for it?
[06:06:27] <PhonicUK> jquery doesn't think that the tag exists
[06:07:07] <PhonicUK> I can see a few comments about it on stackoverflow, but nobody actually using that method live
[06:07:17] <PhonicUK> you can use a <code> block with a class to make it hidden to the same effect though
[06:07:40] <xinming> PhonicUK: I know, But wish to understand how does script tag worked. :-)
[06:07:50] <xinming> I mean, How do we make it work this way
[06:09:48] <PhonicUK> aah got it
[06:10:22] <xinming> PhonicUK: Actually, Some one already make it work
[06:10:27] <xinming> That's why I'm curious
[06:10:50] <xec> xinming: writing using .html() seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/1/
[06:10:54] <PhonicUK> http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/2/
[06:11:04] <seutje> xqo: how old is the jQuery ur using?
[06:11:16] <xinming> I was thinking maybe the returned "string" still attached some info which tells it's string
[06:11:20] <xinming> let ne ceck
[06:11:22] <xinming> let me check
[06:11:23] <xinming> thanks
[06:11:28] <xqo> seutje 1.10.2
[06:12:51] <xinming> But they are not appendTo
[06:13:04] <xinming> I wished the Content here texts should also be there
[06:13:06] <xinming> But i"ll try
[06:13:09] <PhonicUK> I think it's just .append()
[06:13:29] <PhonicUK> xinming, http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/3/
[06:13:59] <seutje> xqo: works fine for me o.O http://jsfiddle.net/mNF6S/
[06:14:00] <xinming> PhonicUK: do you think it's a bug?
[06:14:08] <PhonicUK> xinming, the one I just linked works fine
[06:14:13] <PhonicUK> I'm pretty sure its append not appendTo
[06:14:35] <PhonicUK> ah, .appendTo is the other way around
[06:14:46] <PhonicUK> you do $("someHTML").appendTo(body);
[06:14:52] <xinming> PhonicUK: I mean, the $('#a').appendTo('#b'); shouldn't equal to $('#b').append($('#a'))  ???
[06:14:55] <PhonicUK> or body.append($("someHTML"))
[06:14:57] <PhonicUK> you had them backwards
[06:15:05] <PhonicUK> yes they are, but you had them backwards
[06:15:05] <jesudas> add class to element only if its ios webview or andriod uiwebview ? is this possible using jquery
[06:15:37] <PhonicUK> jesudas, I don't think so - unless the webviews are in apps that you control and can make them do extra things
[06:15:38] <xinming> PhonicUK: Sorry, I don't get what you mean by "you had them backwards"
[06:15:52] <PhonicUK> xinming, you had the elements the wrong way around
[06:16:13] <jesudas> phonicUk :: Yes its in the app only
[06:16:27] <xinming> $("#result").append($("#test-node").html());   <-- This wored too, without need of .contents
[06:16:30] <xinming> .contents()
[06:16:34] <xinming> I'll try with appendTo
[06:17:02] <PhonicUK> jesudas, I'm pretty sure both of those webviews will let you run a javascript function, so just have a function in your HTML that applies the class when invoked and make the webviews invoke that method
[06:17:02] <jesudas> i cant using mediaquery as its apply style element in the mobile browser also
[06:17:39] <xinming> PhonicUK: http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/4/   <---
[06:17:57] <xinming> PhonicUK: Where I did wrong in this version please?
[06:18:08] <PhonicUK> hmm
[06:18:33] <xinming> Because, if thoese 2 are not equal, I want to find the reason.
[06:18:42] <jesudas> phonicUk :: if i am using the Useragent.. i wont able to differenciate itsstock browser or UIWebView
[06:19:38] <PhonicUK> jesudas, did you read what I said about making the webview invoke a script?
[06:20:30] <ooppa> seutje: It works lol
[06:20:58] <PhonicUK> xinming, figured it out
[06:20:59] <xinming> PhonicUK: http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/5/    <--- Here, The first and the thrid works perfectly.
[06:21:06] <xinming> but the second failed
[06:21:11] <xinming> So, It really confused me.
[06:21:14] <PhonicUK> the default object created when using $(...) to make the node doesn't work
[06:22:34] <PhonicUK> xinming, $("<div>HelloWorld</div>").appendTo("#test-node"); doesn't work
[06:22:42] <PhonicUK> because the object that jquery makes for you does not have a .appendTo
[06:23:27] <xinming> yes, But it append to .appendTo('#result')
[06:23:39] <xinming> $('<div class="">Hello</div><div class="">world</div>').appendTo('#result');       <--- This version worked.
[06:24:38] <xinming> It seems the html texts in script node get somehow executed at some stage.
[06:26:00] <xinming> It really makes me confused
[06:26:22] <PhonicUK> xinming, I think i've figured it out
[06:26:35] <PhonicUK> I think you've got extra hidden characters in the above script tag
[06:26:58] <PhonicUK> xinming, it breaks as soon as there's a new line in the script
[06:27:25] <PhonicUK> xinming, this works - http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/6/
[06:27:49] <PhonicUK> xinming, this doesn't -  http://jsfiddle.net/tAyLS/7/
[06:28:02] <PhonicUK> only difference is the new line in the script tag
[06:28:02] <t432> Cork: around?
[06:28:34] <xinming> PhonicUK: Yes, I noticed
[06:28:34] <LucaS05> hi. i'm using jquery for the facebook login, but facebook by default require the friend list, how can i change that?
[06:29:00] <xinming> PhonicUK: The strange thing is
[06:29:19] <PhonicUK> xinming, eitherway there's not much point wasting any more time on it given that you have a method that works using .append
[06:29:36] <xinming> PhonicUK: Thanks for your time.
[06:29:40] <PhonicUK> np
[06:29:44] <xinming> So, It's a browser issue
[06:29:52] <PhonicUK> or a jq issue
[06:29:53] <PhonicUK> hard to say
[06:29:53] <xinming> I just tried, Even when we add a single space
[06:30:14] <xinming> I just add a single space to  the  id="test-node'><div> ...
[06:30:22] <t432> Following line is displaying [Object Arrat] in console, whats missing? 	    	   $.get('http://localhost/search/term=',this.$node.val(), function(data){ console.log(data); });
[06:30:30] <t432> Array*
[06:30:30] <xinming> I mean add a single space in the test node, We meet the problem again.
[06:31:59] <ooppa> Any idea why my ajax call strips all tags away?
[06:33:55] <t432> anyone?
[06:35:25] <ooppa> Actually it is because of the .find
[06:36:12] <ooppa> Any way to make it not happen?
[06:39:36] <xqo> seutje i had to change to use .attr instead of .prop. that works
[06:40:10] <seutje> that's mighty odd
[06:40:20] <t432> Following console line is displaying [Object Array], what wrong? 	     $.get('http://localhost/search/term=',this.$node.val(), function(data){ console.log(data); });
[06:40:52] <ooppa> seutje: How do I make .find not remove all my <tags>?
[06:41:43] <ooppa> console.log(html); returns with tags but induvidual console.log(content); and console.log(pos); return without <span> tags etc
[06:43:32] <Cork> t432: the server is most likely returning json
[06:43:49] <ooppa> Ahhh i fugured it out
[06:43:50] <t432> Cork: that is true, yes
[06:44:07] <Cork> t432: console.log(JSON.stringify(data))
[06:44:24] <Cork> t432: data is the parsed json data
[06:46:27] <Syrit> Hello guys, I am trying to select an input elemnt that is out of a fieldset, i have multiple fieldsets inside a div, and after (out of) each one, there is a hidden input containing the id, i have a button inside each fieldset, now i don't know how can i get the value of that input ?
[06:46:57] <t432> Cork: all json nodes returned by server will be separated by ',' correct?
[06:47:07] <Cork> Syrit: $(this).closest('fieldset').next()
[06:47:23] <Syrit> .next ! great Cork! thank you a ton !
[06:47:25] <Cork> t432: uh, it should be [val,val,val]
[06:47:45] <t432> Cork: thats an array, right?
[06:47:50] <Cork> yes
[06:48:04] <t432> thats makes my job a lot simpler :)
[06:49:14] <t432> that*
[06:49:33] <Cork> t432: most language has support for generating json
[06:49:43] <Cork> (i dare to say all do)
[06:50:10] <t432> i know :)
[06:50:29] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i got this autocomplete that doesn't want to work with me.. it gets the correct data but it shows an empty suggestlist. What i want to get done is select an item from the list and fill in the corresponding field from the city. http://pastebin.com/HTNKxztC
[06:55:27] <computer2000> help: i have a string "1, 2, 3" and i want to make an array of it, how to?
[06:56:08] <grafi> computer2000 "1, 2, 3".split(', ') ?
[06:56:24] <Cork> :)
[06:56:26] <computer2000> grafi: thx
[06:57:13] <computer2000> now the array contains strings: ["1", "2", "3"] how can i make it contain integers?
[06:59:21] <grafi> computer2000 "1, 2, 3".split(', ').map(function(i) { return parseInt(i, 10); })
[06:59:42] <computer2000> grafi: thx
[07:01:53] <Syrit> Does any one know by any chance, how would i get the model id that i am editing from the form ? i am using rails
[07:02:14] <Cork> computer2000: warning though .map only works in ie>8
[07:02:31] <Cork> Syrit: wrong channel
[07:02:41] <grafi> waaaah IE
[07:02:42] <computer2000> Cork: yea, do you know if underscore's indexOf() is ie8 compatible?
[07:02:50] <Syrit> yes, i guesses so Cork, but i want to use jQuery to do so
[07:03:00] <Syrit> guessed*
[07:03:01] <Cork> Syrit: but the data is #rubyonrails related
[07:03:10] <Syrit> okay, i will go there
[07:03:44] <Cork> computer2000: unless it adds the feature for ie<9 then no
[07:04:29] <Cork> computer2000: $.map("1, 2, 3".split(', '), function(v) { return parseInt(v, 10); }); works in all browsers though
[07:04:50] <grafi> cheater Cork :P
[07:05:03] <Cork> :)
[07:08:10] <xinming> PhonicUK: It's a bug in jq 1.9.1
[07:08:12] <xinming> I just now found
[07:08:28] <xinming> I just now found, that with 1.8.3/2.0.2 version of jquery, They both worked.
[07:08:33] <xinming> Only 1.9.1 has the problem.
[07:08:59] <Layke> How would I select nodes within a domNode? For example, if I have a node reference stored in a variable... and I want to get all "a" elements within that domNode?
[07:09:03] <xinming> This bug wasted me 3 hours of time. >_<
[07:09:08] <xinming> But good to know the problem.
[07:09:22] <Layke> ${ domNode, "a") would be something like what I want...  but that obviously is wrong :)
[07:09:32] <Layke> $( domNode, "a") I mean.
[07:10:26] <NoiseEee> Layke: $(domElementReference).find('a')
[07:10:40] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/find/ @ Layke
[07:10:54] <Layke> NoiseEee, Thanks. I think I can actually do $(  "a" ,  domNode ) after trying that?
[07:11:10] <NoiseEee> what do you mean
[07:11:16] <Layke> I mean they both do the same thing
[07:11:20] <Layke> Just trying to learn options.
[07:11:25] <NoiseEee> i dont think they do, no
[07:11:35] <NoiseEee> you'll get all "a"s in the document, not within the node.
[07:12:08] <Layke> Okay.  (That's not what my console is saying though?)
[07:12:17] <Layke> Appears to return the same results.
[07:13:10] <Layke> For example, $( "a", $('#myTab') ) appears to return the same as $( "#myTab").find("a")
[07:13:18] <Layke> You answered my question with the find() though. :)
[07:16:49] <NoiseEee> interesting, i wouldn't have suspected that. maybe because http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-think-right-to-left-with-jquery/
[07:19:53] <Quest> trying to open a dialog box when the user clicks a div/li . the dialog box has a form in it with a submit button. but it seems quite tough
[07:23:14] <Quest> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[07:27:20] <Layke> If I have something really simple like this.. http://pastie.org/private/4p2yoknp6vsnrftxkbswa How can I call a function within the click function that would require a different context? For example, I'd like to be able to  change the context of the function(e){} so that it's actually referring to "this" (From the same context of where it's called)
[07:27:29] <JLT_> This is going to be hard to explain. I have a grid that appears on top of a canvas here: http://jsfiddle.net/qefw8/ this is the base of an image editor. The first issue with this kind of grid is that it'll appear like this if the canvas size is not in the grid size times table - http://jsfiddle.net/qefw8/1/ the second issue would be that if the grid was small or a canvas was huge that'll take up a lot time to generate all those divs.
[07:28:02] <JLT_> The final issue would be the fact that if I have an image which is designed to be draggable on the canvas.. because the grid is above it.. I focus on the grid rather than the image. So http://jsfiddle.net/qefw8/2/ dragging that image just isn't going to happen. Any ideas how I can go about this/

[07:41:21] <t432> Where can i find the reference for the JSON object e.g. JSON.stringify
[07:41:35] <t432> does it even belong to query?
[07:41:40] <t432> jquery*
[07:41:53] <t432> can't seem to find it in the api
[07:42:34] <j_wright> MDN?
[07:43:52] <j_wright> no, its part of your browser or a polyfill
[07:45:15] <t432> yeah, just found out through search
[07:45:26] <t432> version 1 works fine, problem wth version 2 (line 11) http://pastebin.com/VY9rXFsK
[07:46:05] <t432> source param in line 11 expects an array
[07:47:27] <t432> but "JSON.stringify(data)" format is "[some, data]", which i think is a string
[07:48:35] <j_wright> what were you expecting from a stringify method?
[07:48:50] <Quest> I just have a simple form to show in a jquery dialog. how to create the contents of that form in the dialog in a simple html manner.  http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form ?
[07:49:02] <t432> right, how would you turn that into an array?
[07:50:00] <j_wright> t432: i think you are using the wrong thing? you start with an array or object, pass it to stringify to get a string
[07:50:09] <j_wright> why would you need to convert it back
[07:50:55] <t432> j_wright: server response is of format [Object Array], while the 'source' param (line 11) expects an Array
[07:51:30] <t432> server response is json format
[07:51:52] <j_wright> then you want parse, not stringify
[07:52:16] <t432> i tried parse, also
[07:52:25] <t432> hang on, let me try it again
[07:53:48] <t432> j_wright: parse gives me the following error: [15:53:19.987] SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[07:54:00] <j_wright> your json is invalid

[08:16:36] <Deele> I have a jquery plugin createMyDialog that creates dialog element $dialog inside given element, event is bind on close button, clicking that, dialog is closed and $dialog.remove() is called, after this, my createMyDialog function is no more avilable with error "TypeError: $(...).createMyDialog is not a function"
[08:17:49] <resno> the datepicker wont apply my dateformat, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/mDAct/2/
[08:18:10] <Deele> is there an issue with .remove() method deleting my plugin?
[08:33:44] <t432> anyone around?
[08:34:08] <j_wright> t432: did you fix your invalid json producing server?
[08:34:43] <t432> j_wright: I made some changes but till not working, i'll get paste bin.
[08:36:40] <blez> how to monitor the DOM for creating/deleting an element?
[08:38:10] <t432> j_wright: if i type the url (see paste bin) directly into a browser the response if get back is  ["FOO"], (i.e. response is no longer json) however line 2 prints out [object Array]. - http://pastebin.com/wr37FDmc
[08:39:35] <j_wright> why would ["FOO"] indicate that?
[08:40:07] <t432> why would ["FOO"] indicate its not json?
[08:40:42] <t432> because I removed the line from the server side which converts the data to json.
[08:41:38] <j_wright> except that the server has to still output it as text in some format, it won't output an object to your browser
[08:42:37] <t432> i would guess that would be string.
[08:42:46] <j_wright> yeah
[08:43:10] <t432> if it was json, it would have printed it out in json format in browser.
[08:43:32] <t432> if it's a string how would i convert to an array?

[08:46:43] <t432> good one.
[08:46:56] <dwarder> i need to add class but don't want to add it if it is already aded how can i do this the easy way?
[08:47:11] <t432> j_wright: will that work? output is not json.
[08:47:21] <dwarder> $('.myClass').addClass('anotherClass');
[08:47:38] <j_wright> what output?
[08:47:40] <dwarder> i don't want to have two anotherClass'es added to one element
[08:47:56] <t432> ["FOO"]
[08:48:02] <t432> server response.
[08:48:23] <t432> yes, that does not work.
[08:48:51] <grafi> dwarder should be no problem
[08:49:04] <j_wright> seems to be valid JSON
[08:49:11] <grafi> dwarder http://jsfiddle.net/AzZqe/
[08:50:08] <t432> j_wright: how is valid json?
[08:50:12] <j_wright> http://jsonlint.com/ thinks it is
[08:50:19] <t432> do you see any curly braces?
[08:50:31] <j_wright> it doesn't need to be an object to be valid json
[08:50:36] <grafi> true
[08:51:16] <t432> its no json for the last time.
[08:51:30] <j_wright> heh
[08:51:37] <t432> if you want to be json i can change the format.
[08:51:48] <t432> want it*
[08:51:52] <grafi> i want to be json
[08:51:56] <grafi> make me json
[08:51:59] <t432> heh
[08:52:03] <j_wright> heh
[08:52:13] <j_wright> t432: did you try it at jsonlint.com?
[08:52:29] <grafi> ["grafi"]
[08:52:32] <grafi> JSON!
[08:52:50] <t432> j_wright: i don't have to, I know what I set the format in the server code to output
[08:52:58] <j_wright> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627
[08:53:01] <j_wright> there read that
[08:53:15] <j_wright> or the frontpage of json.org for pretty pictures
[08:53:55] <t432> j_wright: besides JSON.parse is not unable to translate that data
[08:54:02] <t432> unable*
[08:54:17] <j_wright> > JSON.parse('["FOO"]');
[08:54:17] <j_wright> FOO
[08:54:30] <grafi> oô
[08:54:34] <grafi> cheater ^^
[08:54:55] <j_wright> it is not unable, it is able, yes
[08:57:47] <Armistice> Does anyone know of any good jquery plugins for drawing gridlines on canvas? Looking for something similar to that you'd see on photoshop... but any suggestions would be worth a look. I found grid.js which isn't in jquery but it makes the canvas appear zoomed in x2.
[09:09:53] <dwarder> i have a list of elements $('.myelemets') , how do i get all id attributes of those .elements
[09:10:03] <dwarder> .each() doesn't seem to work
[09:11:21] <duch_kazatel> $('.myelements').each(function(){/* $(this).attr() should give you what you want. */})
[09:11:43] <resno> the datepicker wont apply my dateformat, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/mDAct/2/
[09:11:59] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, console log out $('.myelements') to make sure it's actually matching.
[09:12:31] <t432> i think it is the server that is not producing json.
[09:12:42] <t432> (even when I want it to)
[09:13:04] <zmode> resno: it should be a string
[09:13:31] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: thank you
[09:13:54] <zmode> resno: you probably want to always set it too, not onClose
[09:14:02] <duch_kazatel> dwarder I'd note that sort of stuff can be slow in IE.
[09:15:04] <resno> zmode: ok
[09:19:10] <Deele> could you help with plugins?
[09:19:46] <Deele> I'm following http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ guide
[09:20:02] <Deele> and "Provide Public Access to Secondary Functions as Applicable"
[09:21:09] <Deele> in main plugin, I have var repeatAction = function() { $.ajax(ajaxRequestOptions); } but how can I access ajaxRequestOptions from another plugin function, that resides outside of plugin
[09:21:40] <Deele> $.fn.createMyDialog.repeatAction = function() {
[09:22:08] <Deele> how do I pass ajaxRequestOptions to this new function?
[09:23:40] <Deele> I mean, I can $.fn.createMyDialog.repeatAction = function(ajaxRequestOptions) { $.ajax(ajaxRequestOptions); } but then, I won't be able to call .repeatAction() from outside
[09:24:38] <Deele> maybe, if in main plugin I somehow add ajaxRequestOptions to this, the plugin instance
[09:26:11] <ravenzz> Deele you should consider each plugin in isolation
[09:26:24] <ravenzz> so accessing ajaxRequestOptions from another plugin is a bad idea
[09:27:45] <Deele> ravenzz so I just this.repeatAction = function() {} from main plugin?
[09:28:35] <Deele> I could just return { repeatAction: function() {}} from main plugin, but then I can't chain
[09:29:52] <ravenzz> wait
[09:30:08] <ravenzz> Deele I mean hold on, I am going to prepare an example for you
[09:30:32] <Deele> I'm returning $dialog element always
[09:31:14] <Deele> so chaining after $('body').createMyDialog() will do actions on $dialog
[09:41:47] <ravenzz> Deele http://jsfiddle.net/2RCtP/
[09:41:53] <ravenzz> you can skip the comments for now
[09:42:42] <ravenzz> here your plug have two methods init and doSomething
[09:43:00] <ravenzz> and you can execute doSomething with $elem.dialog('doSomething');
[09:45:19] <ravenzz> Deele now if you want to comunicate with other plugins, I would like to suggest you to do so through events
[09:45:36] <ravenzz> i'll show you an example
[10:01:17] <Deele> ravenzz ok, I will look into it
[10:01:17] <mjn_> join #project-trillek
[10:02:13] <Quest> I have a form, I need to get input text and values of some radio buttons. by those, I would make the url: of the $.ajax jquery call.  how can I grab the values of the form fields and pass to that $.ajax function?
[10:04:55] <DeltaHeavy> How come I can't chain jQuery methods off of '.get' ?
[10:06:06] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy what do you mean?
[10:06:11] <gregf_> hello guys, i'm testing on ie8 (windoze) using jquery-1.6.1.min.js and jquery stops working on some pages :/
[10:06:46] <DeltaHeavy> I can't do: $('.slide-menu').get(2).addClass('.disabled')
[10:06:53] <Quest> my url : is like rest pattern    like      site.com/param1/param2/param3        I have to do site.com/+param1Var+"/"+param2Var+"/" .......
[10:07:04] <gregf_> ff, chrome, opera works fine. but ie8 above is what they want to get working
[10:08:02] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy yes you can - you know it's 0-based though, right?
[10:08:10] <DeltaHeavy> I know
[10:08:15] <DeltaHeavy> Let me try again
[10:08:26] <DeltaHeavy> I was going to use '0' but I didn't want people saying "you can just use first()'
[10:08:40] <gregf_> should i upgrade my jquery to the latest please?
[10:09:08] <gregf_> error is : Object doesn't support this property or method
[10:09:16] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/myCtM/ anyone have any idea why the top works but bottom doesnt it's making me crazy
[10:09:19] <duch_kazatel> gregf what method are you trying to run?
[10:09:25] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: https://www.refheap.com/19571
[10:09:27] <DeltaHeavy> jq = $
[10:09:29] <anew> same exact plugin i'm using
[10:09:51] <DeltaHeavy> jq(jq('.slide-menu').get(0)).find('ul')        Works though
[10:10:06] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: well just jquery, nothing unknown
[10:10:29] <gregf_> on load it just pops this window up and asks me if i want to debug. i tried
[10:10:29] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy ah, that means that get probably doesn't return a jquery objecyt.
[10:10:45] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, that's what I was thinking…is there an alternative that does?
[10:11:07] <duch_kazatel> why are you using .get() anyway?  why not any of the other methods to select an element?
[10:11:16] <duch_kazatel> maybe modify your markup to give it a unique ID?
[10:11:16] <duch_kazatel> etc?
[10:11:49] <DeltaHeavy> I'm more wondering at this point how I can select a specific element from an array of them, and have it return as a jQ object.
[10:12:12] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: but it stops at a line : finally{b=[e,f]
[10:12:56] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: should i upgrade jquery to the latest and try. ie and windoze are a pain. honest
[10:13:10] <anew> anyone
[10:13:18] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ actually they're not.  and you're trying to run a jquery method on a non-jquery object.
[10:15:24] <tkeith> What's the best way to find all a's, buttons, and input[type=button]'s with class .btn and attribute data-click-text and, when one is clicked, disable it and set its text to data-click-text, while still performing the click event?
[10:15:36] <DeltaHeavy> Another question. I have a 'setInterval()' that's created in a hover event. My mouseout function has clearInterval(). Is there any way to pass my 'var x = setInterval()' to the other function without declaring 'x' outside of the event?
[10:16:04] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: would i be able to debug on which undefined object i'm trying to call a method?
[10:16:39] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: let me check. but firefox and chrome done show any errors :/
[10:16:45] <gregf_> *dont
[10:19:31] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: is there a way to validate all the jquery/js code ?
[10:21:55] <plambwk> if i use $('section').append(header)
[10:22:09] <plambwk> how can i specify where header appends within the 'section' html block
[10:22:27] <plambwk> right now its becoming a child of the highest div within section
[10:23:24] <shoky> plambwk: append adds it as last child to the section
[10:23:57] <plambwk> okay, is there a way to make it append as the first child?
[10:24:02] <shoky> prepend
[10:24:06] <plambwk> roger
[10:24:21] <shoky> shirley
[10:25:14] <plambwk> cool, that worked
[10:25:15] <plambwk> thank you
[10:26:36] <cSharpRun> Morning/afternoon. I'm aware of slideUp, slideDown, and slideToggle in the documentation. Is there a way, without using jQuery UI, to allow for a slide up to reveal content and a slide down to hide it?
[10:30:41] <Hatraz> Is it possible to retreive an embedded SVG element with jQuery? If so, what would be the proper selector to use? I'm unable to so far.
[10:32:00] <cSharpRun> Hatraz: I've done it before, but I think I needed to get a jquery svg plugin to make it work.
[10:33:00] <Hatraz> cSharpRun: Do you know what the plugin was called?
[10:33:34] <cSharpRun> I think it's just called "jQuery SVG". google that, and you should find a page by Keith Wood
[10:36:19] <Hatraz> cSharpRun: Thanks!
[10:37:08] <cSharpRun> now, perhaps you can answer my question. Do you know of a way, without jQuery UI, to allow slide up to show elements of a page and slide down to hide?
[10:45:31] <JLT_> I made a jquery plugin after others didn' work but then I realised that was my wrong doing... Canvas requires width/height attributes and you cannot use css for it so that was my error. Anywho my jQuery plugin is designed to make a grid. I have one issue. One is that you cannot change the stroke color. On the fiddle it's supposed to be set as red. http://jsfiddle.net/wCSRc/
[10:49:12] <fcaceres> is there any channelfor Datatables jQuery plugin?
[10:49:51] <duch_kazatel> fcaceres you can run /list *datatables* and get a list of of channels with "datatables" in the name.
[10:50:02] <fcaceres> ty
[10:52:20] <Richhh> is there a tool can minify related HTML, CSS and js files?
[10:52:50] <JLT_> Also not only that bug... I have another. It may be related with this script. http://jsbin.com/OguYinO/1/ when the grid gets recreated kind of thing, it wil lonly draw 2 lines. You can see an example here http://178.78.101.246/collager/create.php click on the Cog icon for settings, change the grid size to anything else.. and it won't draw the grid properly. Not sure why.
[10:53:36] <JLT_> The grid itself works fine if you draw it multiple times. I tried it with jsfiddle... so it's gotta be related to that collager "plugin" (which isnt' really a plugin to me)
[10:54:41] <duch_kazatel> Richhh what exactly are you looking for?
[10:54:48] <duch_kazatel> like, what do you want the output to look like?
[10:55:28] <Richhh> eg css classes turned into #a, #b, #aa etc
[10:55:43] <Richhh> functions and variables similarly renamed
[10:57:05] <duch_kazatel> probably nothing to that level since tjat
[10:57:09] <duch_kazatel> *that'd be a little much.
[10:57:33] <duch_kazatel> plus thrid party plugins will rely on specific IDs, classes, etc.
[10:57:33] <Aquaword> hello
[10:58:21] <Aquaword> anyone can help why the input fields are jumping, in this site (click on yellow big button): http://bpno.budafest.no/tjenester/guide
[10:58:30] <Aquaword> its jquery tools tooltip
[10:59:12] <Aquaword> I mean the third colored button
[11:03:49] <JLT_> Is anyone able to assist me?
[11:08:45] <Quest>  with jquery, how to make  this html <p>some text</p>   as first child of a div with class="inner-div"      that is inside the outer div with id="outer-div"  ?
[11:09:25] <JLT_> $(".inner-div").prepend("<p>some text</p>");
[11:09:56] <JLT_> .append will add it to the end of the div whilst .prepend will add it to the beginning
[11:10:45] <Quest> JLT_,  the .inner-div must be a child  of #outer-div (some where in its dom)
[11:11:11] <JLT_> Quest then $("#outer-div .inner-div").prepend("<p>some text</p>");
[11:13:22] <Quest> $("#outer-div .inner-div") ? ?
[11:13:42] <JLT_> Basically it's similar in css. You're looking for .inner-div inside #outer-div
[11:14:19] <JLT_> if you wanted to select #outer-div AND .inner-div then it would be "#outer-div, .inner-div" notice the comma. :)
[11:14:21] <duch_kazatel> Quest are you familiar with CSS selectors?  jquery's selector engine is basically the same thing.
[11:14:29] <duch_kazatel> it's called "sizzle"
[11:15:44] <rabbite> is it possible to add a search bar to this?
[11:15:45] <rabbite> http://jsfiddle.net/582ms/1/
[11:16:30] <DeltaHeavy> rabbite: Yes
[11:16:54] <rabbite> I'd like it to look something like the one on the left here:
[11:16:55] <rabbite> https://github.com/rabihkodeih/bootstrap-transfer/blob/master/screenshots/screenshot.PNG
[11:17:31] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  JLT_  yes.   but this is the html that i want to prepend. it has " and /  and i think it will cause problems. alot? http://pastebin.ca/2464651
[11:17:38] <rabbite> Not really sure where to start though.
[11:18:20] <plambwk> can you distinguish between scrolling down and scrolling up using .scroll ?
[11:18:47] <duch_kazatel> Quest you need to convert it to be safe to use ;)
[11:18:55] <duch_kazatel> try wrapping all of that with single quotes.
[11:19:06] <duch_kazatel> one at the beginning, one at the end.
[11:19:19] <Quest> hm...
[11:19:44] <duch_kazatel> but the larger question is why you're inserting so much.
[11:21:19] <plambwk> nevermind
[11:21:44] <plambwk> there isnt an easy fix
[11:23:18] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  doesnt looks good. IDE stats error on line 2 as missing closing quote.  does all the html has to be on one line? http://pastebin.ca/2464653
[11:24:06] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[11:24:16] <JLT_> Quest shouldn't have to be. I've placed html on multiple lines before in javascript... but yeah as duch_kazatel said, make a fiddle. ;p
[11:24:20] <duch_kazatel> and that's now how you do that.
[11:24:29] <duch_kazatel> that needs to be one big long line.
[11:24:38] <duch_kazatel> not broken out like that.
[11:24:43] <duch_kazatel> but that's still a really bad idea.
[11:25:09] <plambwk> how would i get this header to slide back out after the the first animation is over
[11:25:09] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  it needs to be on one long line? JLT_  you said contrary?
[11:25:10] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/DmERt/18/
[11:26:18] <JLT_> I'm going by an educated guess. I'm pretty sure I've used multiple lines.. but if it doesn't work then I must of concatenated it onto variables.
[11:26:46] <duch_kazatel> you're running into issues of multiline javascript parsing.
[11:26:53] <duch_kazatel> why are you inserting so much html via js?
[11:26:53] <JLT_> Actually yes. duch_katzatel is correct Quest. I just tested it myself.
[11:27:09] <Quest> http://jsfiddle.net/wP6L8/
[11:27:34] <Quest> there got to be a solution. sane one.
[11:27:39] <JLT_> var html = "something"; *new line* html += "something else"; *new line* and so on and so forth.
[11:27:50] <duch_kazatel> that's a really bad idea nyway.,
[11:28:13] <duch_kazatel> i have to go to lunch. 'yall enjoy.
[11:29:22] <JLT_> Lemme give you a possibly more saner solution Quest but many may not like it. Wait.
[11:29:44] <Quest> JLT_,  just dont want the javascript dom creation thing
[11:30:06] <eukreign> is there a way to build a custom version of jquery-ui using grunt
[11:30:08] <Quest> duch_away, any ideas?
[11:30:14] <eukreign> with regular jquery you can do "grunt custom:-ajax", etc
[11:33:08] <JLT_> Quest: http://jsfiddle.net/Tr2T8/1/
[11:33:20] <JLT_> Duch_away is having lunch right now, Quest ;)
[11:34:13] <JLT_> Quest: Templates like I just did there... javascript templating engines rely on them. However they will often parse the template and insert javascript variables. With that fiddle, it doesn't parse it but rather just grab whats there.
[11:34:29] <Quest> JLT_,  ya but i need to change some values of that html while appending
[11:36:24] <JLT_> Quest: There is a little plugin http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/javascript-sprintf give that a read. You will specify sort of "variables" in the template,a nd tehn you will grab that template in jquery and replace "variables" with the relative data using sprintf. It's probably your best bet.
[11:37:55] <JLT_> Named arguments is probably easier to understand Quest :)
[11:39:48] <Quest> hm
[11:39:53] <Quest> but with that. templates cant be used. as templates cant be changed up
[11:39:58] <Quest> with javascript args
[11:41:11] <JLT_> Quest I'll show you an example. :)
[11:41:31] <Quest> k
[11:46:58] <JLT_> Quest: http://jsfiddle.net/Tr2T8/2/ scroll down to the bottom of the javascript for the actual usage... most of that javascript is just the minified source of the sprintf library.
[11:47:14] <JLT_> As you see I used those named parameters in the template itself... and used sprintf to replace them :)
[11:49:40] <Quest> oh. i never saw that before
[11:49:44] <Quest> %.. hmm..
[11:50:31] <JLT_> A literal % sign would probably be %% I'm not sure though.
[11:51:17] <Cork> JLT_: there is a lot of cleaner solutions then printf
[11:51:21] <Phlow> printf is a relic of the past, and really shouldn't be replicated imo
[11:51:27] <Cork> that has less risk of things going wrong
[11:51:37] <JLT_> Cork feel free to share your solutions. :)
[11:52:07] <Cork> JLT_: underscore, jqote2, mustache, ...
[11:53:00] <JLT_> Well yes... I was just providing solutions iwthout a templating library. If you didn't read, I did mention that templates like the one I did (prior to sprintf) are often used with templating libraries.
[11:53:15] <Cork> JLT_: you are using a templating solution
[11:53:29] <Cork> you're just using printf as a model for the template lib
[11:54:25] <Quest> JLT_,  thanks
[11:54:38] <JLT_> Take on board what Cork says before he blames me for bad advice ;p
[11:54:41] <JLT_> Quest ^
[11:54:55] <JLT_> Anyway my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/wCSRc/ howcome the grid lines are not Red?
[11:56:31] <Purduecer> Is there a support chat for JQuery, or should I simply ask those sorts of questions here?
[11:57:03] <grafi> erm
[11:57:11] <grafi> this is the support chat for jquery Purduecer
[11:57:50] <DeltaHeavy> Purduecer?
[11:57:50] <Purduecer> Alright; I'm trying to get some pretty basic click behavior to work: http://jsfiddle.net/5V6PP/15/
[11:58:07] <grafi> JLT_ try strokeStyle instead of strokeColor
[11:58:11] <Purduecer> Haven't had any luck yet, though; could anybody have a look and give me an idea where I've gone wrong?
[11:58:14] <DeltaHeavy> Oh wait derp
[11:58:34] <DeltaHeavy> Purduecer: $('#team_selector').click(function() { … });
[11:58:40] <JLT_> Yeah that worked like a charm haha grafi thanks :)
[11:58:45] <grafi> np
[11:59:17] <DeltaHeavy> $('#team_selector li').click(function() { … });             Seems to be what you want actually
[12:00:26] <Quest> Cork,  what solutions?
[12:00:42] <Cork> Quest: underscore, jqote2, mustache
[12:00:45] <Cork> just to name a few
[12:00:57] <Cork> those are more robust then printf
[12:01:01] <Purduecer> That seems to have done most of the work I want, thanks! How do I specify that I only want to delegate to elements in the "bar" class? (as opposed to other li's within the "current" class below the bar?)
[12:02:15] <JLT_> To elaborate Quest, those mentioned are templating engines. :)
[12:02:48] <Purduecer> Nevermind, I seem to have figured it out
[12:03:14] <Purduecer> @DeltaHeavy Thank you very much :-)
[12:08:08] <DeltaHeavy> np

[12:13:37] <grafi> hm
[12:13:58] <grafi> so you dont really need *all* events ?
[12:14:12] <JmZ> im trying .on('dragover', ...).on('dragend', ...).on('drop', ...)
[12:14:17] <JmZ> but the dragend and drop events never fire
[12:14:48] <grafi> .on('dragover dragend drop', ...) i think thats the way to do it
[12:15:02] <grafi> to have the same handler at least
[12:15:52] <JmZ> well, dragover fires just fine. i can't figure out why the other two don't. so i was going to log all fired events to see if i got the name wrong or if they even fire at all
[12:18:13] <grafi> not sure how you could do that
[12:30:48] <Quest> I am using this on some divs. http://pastebin.ca/2464669    it works fine. but when I add more divs to dom on runtime by jquery .append somwhere (which uses  similar functionality). it cease to work. what could be the reason? where should it be placed up? at doc.ready() or at start. ?
[12:32:33] <duch_kazatel> Quest use event delegation.
[12:32:57] <duch_kazatel> look at the other version of .on() that takes a second arg - bind to the parent even then listen for clicks on the children.
[12:34:14] <Quest> what you said was fantastic i guess. but got over my head as iam a newbie
[12:34:35] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:34:46] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  i just redeclared same $() things after i added the divs to dom. (in an ajax call) and it seems to work
[12:34:52] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[12:35:12] <duch_kazatel> $('#parentSelector').on('click', '.childElements', function(){/* your code here*/})
[12:35:16] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  isnt there a way to make the scripts allwasy available to html even the html that is created by jquery dom addings and prepends.?
[12:35:33] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  no... no . wait
[12:35:55] <duch_kazatel> where #parentSelector is something that exists on pageload, and .childElements are the things you want to trigger on.
[12:35:59] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[12:36:40] <duch_kazatel> Quest when you bind events, you're binding them to things that exist on the page - you use event delegation so you don't have to manually bind when they become available.
[12:36:51] <duch_kazatel> that works because of something called "bubbling" in javascript.
[12:36:56] <duch_kazatel> it's a very important core concept to learn.
[12:37:40] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  http://pastebin.ca/2464674       line41 - 44 were already added at the bottom of document in $(document).ready(function(){      but it didnt worked untill i re added 41-44. (it did worked for the static generated html in normal way. not dom added one)
[12:37:55] <duch_kazatel> I'm not going to read all of that./
[12:37:58] <duch_kazatel> also pastebin sucks.
[12:37:59] <duch_kazatel> but again.
[12:38:02] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[12:38:06] <duch_kazatel> i all ready explained your fix ;)
[12:38:09] <Quest> just take an overview
[12:38:45] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[12:38:49] <duch_kazatel> you've done it all wrong.
[12:38:52] <duch_kazatel> look at my explanation.
[12:39:01] <duch_kazatel> don't bind events in ajax calls like that.
[12:39:32] <lasha> hey guys
[12:39:38] <lasha> I have a performance question
[12:40:02] <lasha> say I have something like this globally loaded on every single page of a website:
[12:40:07] <Quest> hm
[12:40:40] <lasha> $(".prettify").on("click", function(e){ …do awesomeness…});
[12:40:43] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  why dont the newly created dom elements in that ajax had the jquery functions ?
[12:40:53] <lasha> not every page will have an element with a class of .prettify
[12:40:55] <duch_kazatel> Quest because they don't exist when you bind the event.
[12:40:56] <duch_kazatel> you can'
[12:41:01] <duch_kazatel> *can't bind to what doesn't exist.
[12:41:06] <duch_kazatel> that's why you use event delegation.
[12:41:34] <lasha> so, all that will happen is javascript will LOOK for the element with that classname, and then just move forward since it won't find anythin
[12:41:39] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  they were declared in  $(document).ready(function(){     at bottom. so they should be in memory (avaialble) untill the document is not closed up.
[12:41:42] <lasha> it won't execute what's inside the function
[12:41:56] <duch_kazatel> Quest it has to be in the document, loaded, parsed etc.
[12:42:00] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[12:42:17] <DeltaHeavy> lasha: None of that code is executed until the event is triggered.
[12:42:25] <Quest> duch_kazatel,   $(document).ready(function(){   functions      arent IN The document?
[12:42:26] <duch_kazatel> it will be parsed but unused.
[12:42:45] <lasha> well, since the actual BINDING never occurs, nothing will execute, right?
[12:42:51] <duch_kazatel> it'll parse.
[12:42:54] <duch_kazatel> but not execute.
[12:43:04] <duch_kazatel> and quest anything in doc ready executes once on pageload.
[12:43:04] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  ok. how about i declare them at top of page in header.        shouldnt they be avaialble for all later on?
[12:43:05] <lasha> the only thing javascript/jquery will do is ATTEMP a lookup of .prettify in the DOM
[12:43:28] <duch_kazatel> Quest you have to bind to something that exists.
[12:43:33] <Quest> oh
[12:43:36] <duch_kazatel> if it doesn't exist, you can't bind to it.
[12:43:51] <DeltaHeavy> lasha: That, and parse the JavaScript into computer useable code IIRC.
[12:43:54] <duch_kazatel> if you utilize event delegation, you can bind to a parent that exists, then change the children however you'd like.
[12:44:01] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  so newly dom creates are not bind.   (but the css is by the way. i wonder why contrary in JS)
[12:44:17] <duch_kazatel> Quest because of how events are bound.
[12:44:34] <duch_kazatel> CSS does because that's a completely different interface.
[12:44:52] <duch_kazatel> you don't reexecute ALL of the javascript to figure that out.
[12:44:54] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  so how to correct the problem so that pre made html works fine and newly dom creates also work fine? where should i declare the functions?
[12:45:09] <duch_kazatel> please make a fiddle.
[12:45:25] <Quest> very tough..         huge cod
[12:46:07] <duch_kazatel> it's not where you declare the code.
[12:46:07] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  online webpage would be fine? or teamviewer?
[12:46:10] <duch_kazatel> it's what you bind it to.
[12:46:14] <duch_kazatel> jsfidle.
[12:46:24] <duch_kazatel> your code is very messy as-is.
[12:46:29] <duch_kazatel> a working example would be fine, too.
[12:46:34] <Quest> yes. dev cod
[12:46:41] <duch_kazatel> "dev cod"?
[12:46:48] <Quest> development code
[12:46:49] <duch_kazatel> and either way you need to bind to an element that exists when the code executes.
[12:46:59] <duch_kazatel> that's all that matters.
[12:47:06] <Quest> hm. how to bind ?
[12:47:08] <duch_kazatel> don't put your binding in your ajax call.
[12:47:14] <duch_kazatel> dude i gave you the sample code.
[12:47:21] <duch_kazatel> if you had a fiddle i could update it and send you a link.
[12:47:28] <Quest> but iam using ajax to create dom
[12:47:41] <duch_kazatel> no, you're using ajax to add elements.
[12:47:46] <Quest> ok. let me try fiddle.
[12:48:00] <duch_kazatel> is there a parent element that exists at pageload?
[12:48:20] <duch_kazatel> and on what element are you trying to trigger on?
[12:48:59] <duch_kazatel> quest
[12:50:13] <duch_kazatel> or not.
[12:51:17] <Quest> more mess duch_kazatel  http://jsfiddle.net/vrXS7/
[12:52:01] <duch_kazatel> dude you're supposed to pair it down to the basics.
[12:52:18] <duch_kazatel> either way - <div id="box-creation-form" title="Create new child box"> exists on pageload, right?
[12:52:28] <duch_kazatel> and on what elements are you trying to trigger?
[12:53:04] <duch_kazatel> .drop-
[12:53:04] <duch_kazatel> menu-button
[12:53:08] <Quest> hm.
[12:53:12] <duch_kazatel> rather, .drop-menu-button
[12:53:15] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  do you have 5 mins?
[12:53:23] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> because I am at work.
[12:53:54] <Quest> well how about you just teamviewer me?
[12:53:56] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:54:03] <Quest> skype screen share
[12:54:08] <Quest> its very hard to show you on fiddle
[12:54:11] <duch_kazatel> I'm at work broseph.
[12:54:16] <Quest> all my code is jumbled
[12:54:20] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to answer the questions I just asked.
[12:54:43] <Quest> all the divs other than the dom add s i ajax exist at page load. obviously
[12:55:09] <duch_kazatel> so is <div id="box-creation-form" title="Create new child box"> a parent div?
[12:55:50] <duch_kazatel> this is really simple - give me a parent element that exists on pageload, and the child element you want to bind the "click" to.
[12:56:18] <duch_kazatel> the child element can be loaded via ajax.
[12:56:40] <Quest> no
[12:56:46] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:56:50] <Quest> parent is board
[12:56:54] <Quest> class board
[12:57:07] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[12:57:14] <Quest> well content is even the parent. and body is super parent
[12:57:26] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:57:32] <duch_kazatel> answer my question.
[12:57:39] <duch_kazatel> give me a parent element that exists on pageload, and the child element you want to bind the "click" to.
[12:57:56] <Quest> html>body>content>board>boxes
[12:58:01] <Quest> >tasks
[12:58:16] <duch_kazatel> so you want to trigger on clicks on tasks?
[12:58:19] <Quest> duch_kazatel> give me a parent element that exists on pageload, html>body>content>board>
[12:58:23] <Quest> all are ^
[12:58:24] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[12:58:31] <duch_kazatel> and board is a class?
[12:58:34] <Quest> yes
[12:58:50] <Quest> <div class="board" id="boardid-${board.id}">
[12:59:03] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  whats your skype?
[12:59:09] <duch_kazatel> DUDE
[12:59:12] <Quest> :)
[12:59:15] <duch_kazatel> I all ready told you i'm not doing that.
[12:59:18] <duch_kazatel> i'm AT WORK>
[12:59:37] <Quest> teamviewer and skype not allowed there?
[12:59:43] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:59:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm supposed to be doing my job.
[12:59:55] <duch_kazatel> not watching screencasts of other peoplke.
[12:59:58] <duch_kazatel> $('.class').on('click', '.board', function(){/* this code will execute when you click on anything with class board */})
[13:00:01] <duch_kazatel> there's your code.
[13:00:55] <duch_kazatel> super easy.
[13:00:59] <Quest> where do i place it?
[13:01:07] <duch_kazatel> early in the page.
[13:01:12] <duch_kazatel> outside of the ajax call.
[13:01:21] <duch_kazatel> you only want to bind that once.
[13:01:34] <duch_kazatel> you need to learn about events, binding, and delegation in javascript.
[13:02:12] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  what if i also want it else than click event. ? just use the fucntion (bind) even if i dont click anthing.        it should apply to all dom elements
[13:02:20] <Quest> newly added by ajax or old
[13:02:31] <duch_kazatel> "what if i also want it else than click event"? try again.
[13:02:46] <duch_kazatel> you want to bind to another event?
[13:02:51] <Quest> I dont want the complusion of click to bind something
[13:03:00] <duch_kazatel> click doesn't bind anything.
[13:03:04] <duch_kazatel> click triggers the event.
[13:03:06] <Quest> event? well yes. dom change event
[13:03:16] <duch_kazatel> you want to detect whenever the dom changes?
[13:03:20] <Quest> yes
[13:03:33] <duch_kazatel> why?
[13:03:50] <Quest> in short I want to load static code with that function.   and also bind that function if i add more elements to dom by ajax.
[13:03:53] <Quest> simple^
[13:04:09] <duch_kazatel> my code will handle that for you.
[13:04:19] <Quest> but it relies on click
[13:04:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:04:28] <duch_kazatel> it listens for click.
[13:04:30] <duch_kazatel> it doesn'
[13:04:34] <duch_kazatel> *it doesn't bind on clock.
[13:04:35] <duch_kazatel> *click
[13:04:40] <Quest> I might not click anthing and still need binding
[13:04:46] <duch_kazatel> that's what it does.
[13:04:57] <Quest> am?
[13:04:59] <Quest> how
[13:05:02] <duch_kazatel> $('.class').on('click', '.board', function(){/* this code will execute when you click on anything
[13:05:02] <duch_kazatel> with class board */})
[13:05:17] <duch_kazatel> that adds an event listener to everything with .class.
[13:05:22] <Quest> it says .on('click'
[13:05:26] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[13:05:30] <duch_kazatel> .on binds the listener.
[13:05:39] <Quest> what if i dont click at all?
[13:05:45] <duch_kazatel> the event is still bound.
[13:05:57] <duch_kazatel> .on() binds events.
[13:06:05] <Quest> then why use click?
[13:06:07] <duch_kazatel> the 'click' is the type of event you're listening for.
[13:06:26] <Quest> if it binds no matter what. then why listen for clicks
[13:06:35] <duch_kazatel> what events are you listening for?
[13:06:49] <duch_kazatel> is there another event you'd rather listen for?
[13:06:53] <Quest> dom element createion event
[13:07:03] <Zzaichik> there are several different events
[13:07:27] <duch_kazatel> then change 'click' to 'DOMSubtreeModified'
[13:07:43] <duch_kazatel> why are you listening for that event?
[13:07:46] <Zzaichik> hover, mouseenter/mouseleave, resize, blue, focus, change, etc
[13:07:50] <Zzaichik> blur*
[13:08:28] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  hm. be right back in 3 mins.
[13:08:31] <Cork> duch_kazatel: DOMSubtreeModified and company is depricated, just so you know
[13:08:35] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  thanks! for holding
[13:08:44] <duch_kazatel> uh i might not be here broseph
[13:08:45] <PhaseCode|HOME> Zzaichik: lol I read blue
[13:08:50] <PhaseCode|HOME> and I was like wtf is the blue vent
[13:08:52] <PhaseCode|HOME> event*
[13:09:04] <duch_kazatel> And Cork what's the replacement?
[13:09:11] <duch_kazatel> because what he's looking to do seems really unusual
[13:09:16] <Cork> mutation observers
[13:09:22] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[13:09:24] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobservers
[13:09:25] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[13:10:10] <Cork> duch_kazatel: the mutation events has serious performance problems
[13:10:10] <duch_kazatel> well shoot.
[13:10:14] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:10:15] <Cork> so they moved to observers instead
[13:10:22] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[13:10:36] <duch_kazatel> i mean, i knew those were all slow.
[13:10:39] <Cork> observers doesn't bubble (the reason for the performance problem with the events
[13:10:41] <duch_kazatel> 'swhy i avoided them.
[13:10:52] <duch_kazatel> what he's looking to do seems really unusual.
[13:12:14] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  visit http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/login

[13:12:55] <duch_kazatel> DUDE
[13:12:57] <duch_kazatel> I ALL READY TOLD YOU.
[13:13:02] <duch_kazatel> I'M NOT LOOKING AT A SCRENCAST.
[13:13:04] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[13:13:24] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  its a page. if you can visit fiddle. this is also a page. just want to show you something
[13:13:30] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:13:33] <duch_kazatel> nope nope.
[13:13:37] <Quest> ok.
[13:14:54] <Zzaichik> I already said I was all ready to not look at screen casts either.
[13:15:02] <PhaseCode|HOME> jesus...
[13:15:03] <duch_kazatel> this dude just doesn't get it.
[13:15:14] <duch_kazatel> pair down your code and fiddle it.
[13:15:15] <Zzaichik> lol
[13:15:16] <duch_kazatel> figure it out.
[13:15:18] <duch_kazatel> read about events.
[13:15:19] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[13:15:28] <duch_kazatel> "hi here is a solution to your problem"
[13:15:36] <duch_kazatel> "but screencast"
[13:15:42] <Quest> i just want to show you something that you wanted to see in the fiddle........
[13:16:07] <duch_kazatel> i have given you the solution.
[13:16:09] <Zzaichik> wait, I should have ended that sentence with 'too'
[13:16:23] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  i admire the solution. but want to share something
[13:16:29] <duch_kazatel> the fiddle it.
[13:16:44] <Quest> iam having errors in fiddle....
[13:16:58] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  why the link i gave you is tough?
[13:17:01] <plambwk> can anyone tell me what the issue is here
[13:17:02] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/DmERt/19/
[13:17:31] <duch_kazatel> Quest your code formatting is terrible, you've got a multiline string that gets inserted as markup, and you won't actually learn about what you need to learn.
[13:18:24] <duch_kazatel> as i've told you plenty of times, go learn about events and binding.
[13:18:34] <Quest> ofcourse..
[13:18:35] <plambwk> the idea is when i scroll, the header slowly dissappears, then as soon as it dissappears, starts reappearing
[13:18:42] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  can you visit the page once?
[13:18:44] <Zzaichik> plambwk: header content doesn't exist on DOM Load
[13:18:45] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:18:48] <Quest> ok.
[13:18:51] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to visit your screencast.
[13:18:58] <Quest> screencast?
[13:19:03] <duch_kazatel> what is the page?
[13:19:04] <Zzaichik> lol
[13:19:06] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  its a webpage.
[13:19:10] <plambwk> Zzaichik: it was working before i added the code for the header to reappear
[13:19:15] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  visit http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/login
[13:19:23] <plambwk> oh wait
[13:19:25] <duch_kazatel> not even loading man.
[13:19:32] <plambwk> you mean its not all contained within the DOM load function
[13:19:47] <Zzaichik> Well, you can't attach an event to something that isn't there when the DOM is loaded.
[13:20:04] <duch_kazatel> Quest i'm going to your little site and it's still not working.
[13:20:47] <plambwk> Zzaichik: why does it work like this? http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/DmERt/20/
[13:22:02] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  opened port now. will work now
[13:22:20] <Quest> duch_kazatel,   admin@admin.com:admin        then        http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/boards/3
[13:22:45] <duch_kazatel> uh dude is this some sort of medical software?
[13:23:00] <duch_kazatel> so what are you trying to accomplish here?
[13:23:01] <Quest> how did you guessed up?
[13:23:12] <duch_kazatel> "reference medical lab" in the upper left.
[13:23:15] <duch_kazatel> so whgat's the issue.
[13:23:20] <Quest> do you see      http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/boards/3
[13:23:24] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:23:25] <Quest> it has a board
[13:23:27] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:23:29] <Quest> and boxes in it
[13:23:35] <duch_kazatel> and is slow as hell
[13:23:36] <Quest> on title. left down arow
[13:23:39] <Zzaichik> @plambwk ahhh, there's an extra closing });
[13:23:44] <plambwk> where
[13:23:47] <Zzaichik> at the bottom
[13:23:48] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:23:49] <Quest> on title. left down arow when pressed. it shows a menu
[13:23:55] <duch_kazatel> keep going.
[13:24:09] <plambwk> wtf
[13:24:13] <Quest> creat box. it calls the form. then ajax. then server database addes. then dom is created.         BUT
[13:24:22] <Zzaichik> plambwk: better, yes?
[13:24:29] <Quest> at that point the newly created box dont have the black down arrow functionality
[13:24:34] <plambwk> well
[13:24:39] <Quest> that was the story
[13:24:43] <plambwk> its displaying the header, but its not doing what i want it to do
[13:24:45] <duch_kazatel> dude that's it?
[13:24:47] <Quest> seeing is believing
[13:24:51] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:25:00] <Quest> thought you might want to know and see
[13:25:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah in a fiddle.
[13:25:08] <Quest> now i will see .on
[13:25:10] <duch_kazatel> you could have recreated that problem.
[13:25:16] <duch_kazatel> what the hell?
[13:25:17] <Quest> very tough
[13:25:22] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[13:25:26] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/DmERt/21/ --> want it to make the height of 'header' 0px over 5000ms, then after 5000ms, make the height 250px in 5000ms
[13:25:32] <Quest> it had .css of 500 lines and all html jumbled up
[13:25:34] <plambwk> (on scroll)
[13:25:41] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  did you tried to create a new box?
[13:25:43] <duch_kazatel> you should have been able to pair that down to a few lines.
[13:25:43] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[13:25:46] <duch_kazatel> you're an idiot.
[13:25:52] <Quest> a little
[13:26:10] <Quest> now this way you can see the real code and inspect dom. then be sure what i was doing
[13:26:14] <Quest> that was my purpose.
[13:26:17] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:26:23] <duch_kazatel> i am not wasting moire time with you.
[13:26:31] <Zzaichik> plambwk:  http://jsfiddle.net/DmERt/22/
[13:26:36] <duch_kazatel> on success you find the thing you inserted and add your arrow.  the .on() event binding method i described will take care of the click event handling.
[13:26:40] <Quest> then iam thankful of what you have wasted til now
[13:27:00] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  hm ok
[13:27:21] <plambwk> Zzaichik: it still isn't reappearing after the delay
[13:27:27] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  add your arrow?      well the full box div is added. not just the arrow
[13:28:21] <plambwk> or it delay's for 5000ms then reduces height to 0px
[13:28:28] <plambwk> its like its getting the order of the animate calls mixed up
[13:28:56] <plambwk> do you get the effect im trying to achieve?
[13:30:36] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  which parent to choose
[13:32:13] <NoiseEee> mom
[13:35:04] <Zzaichik> plambwk: oh I see what you're wanting. okay hang on.
[13:36:32] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  did what you said. $('.box').on('click', '.board', function(){    but its not working for the newly created box dom element
[13:37:54] <Zzaichik> @plambwk I changed it to a click for the sake of me wanting to. But I think you want something like this. http://jsfiddle.net/DmERt/23/
[13:41:12] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  did what you said. $('.box').on('click', '.board', function(){    but its not working for the newly created box dom element
[13:41:33] <plambwk> Zzaichik looking
[13:42:11] <plambwk> Zzaichik: thats exactly what i want, except on scroll
[13:42:51] <Zzaichik> easily changed
[13:43:00] <plambwk> cool
[13:43:04] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/DmERt/25/
[13:43:07] <plambwk> now im trying to figure out how you did it
[13:43:42] <Zzaichik> animate({'height:' '0'}, 'speed', FUNCTION() { NEXT ANIMATION}, 'speed');
[13:43:46] <plambwk> ahh
[13:43:53] <plambwk> you nested a fuction in the original animate call
[13:43:57] <plambwk> that makes sense
[13:43:58] <Zzaichik> so it won't hit that second animation until the first one is complete
[13:44:00] <Zzaichik> aye
[13:44:06] <duch_kazatel> Quest yet again
[13:44:15] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  sorry?
[13:44:23] <plambwk> thank you
[13:44:26] <duch_kazatel> the element you bind to must exist when you run the .on()
[13:44:36] <Zzaichik> plambwk:  your welcome. :)
[13:44:36] <Quest> the . board does exist
[13:44:47] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:44:52] <duch_kazatel> so .board is the parent?
[13:44:59] <Quest> the . board does exist   when you run the .on()
[13:45:06] <Quest> .board is the parent of .box
[13:45:07] <duch_kazatel> then swap the two.
[13:45:14] <Quest> hm
[13:45:29] <plambwk> Zzaichik im trying to get the header to dissappear and reapper on scroll on this site
[13:45:30] <plambwk> http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7155646/slide_from_top.html
[13:45:34] <duch_kazatel> $('.board').on('click', '.box', function(){
[13:45:56] <plambwk> im sure you can see why
[13:46:03] <plambwk> it looks silly floating there as you scroll
[13:46:28] <patchie> Want my Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey script to store data to the office network drive
[13:46:58] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  ya. did that. some thing did changed but its not working. niether is the static html (the other boxes)
[13:47:05] <patchie> is this possible?
[13:47:14] <Zzaichik> plambwk:  you may need to go  $('section').on('scroll', function() { … });
[13:47:15] <patchie> explained here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19273266/want-my-greasemonkey-tampermonkey-script-to-store-data-to-the-office-network-d
[13:47:31] <duch_kazatel> Quest then you're mistaken about something.
[13:47:39] <duch_kazatel> you need a parent that exists on pageload.
[13:47:58] <Zzaichik> $('body').on('click', function() {…}); if it's kicking your ass.
[13:47:58] <Quest> .board is that. despite its not the direct parent
[13:48:03] <Quest> or first parent
[13:48:08] <duch_kazatel> doesn't need to be a direct parent.
[13:48:10] <Quest> Zzaichik,  ok
[13:48:17] <plambwk> use section instead of window
[13:48:22] <plambwk> why is that zzaichik
[13:48:30] <Zzaichik> or I'm sorry, window is what it should be
[13:48:33] <duch_kazatel> Zzaichik that's going to be every click on body.
[13:48:37] <plambwk> cool
[13:49:03] <Zzaichik> duch_kazatel: yeah I really have no idea what the set up is. so my bad.
[13:49:03] <duch_kazatel> he needs to supply a target element as the second arg in that on
[13:49:15] <duch_kazatel> he's got this really poorly made webapp.
[13:49:22] <duch_kazatel> and it's a nightmare.
[13:49:27] <duch_kazatel> it's slow and clunky.
[13:49:34] <duch_kazatel> i'll be something is preventing bubbling.
[13:49:37] <Zzaichik> $('parent-element').on('click', 'child-element', function() { … });
[13:49:46] <Zzaichik> hmmm
[13:49:55] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[13:49:57] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  when i created the new box by dom ajax.  the arrow was expanded. i clicked it. it contracted. after thatn. only  white arrow worked . and none of black ones
[13:49:57] <Zzaichik> sounds like I actually don't want to get involved then. haha
[13:50:33] <duch_kazatel> your use of "dom by ajax" tells me you really have no clue what you're doing.
[13:51:23] <Quest> i mean created dom element inside ajax success
[13:51:27] <Zzaichik> this is still a place to come to learn
[13:51:34] <duch_kazatel> Quest i dunno what to tell you.  i've explained this over and over.
[13:51:46] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  now you see my reall running code on server. what is wrong?
[13:51:53] <duch_kazatel> i am not looking at that again.
[13:52:02] <Zzaichik> lol
[13:52:20] <duch_kazatel> wait are you removing and then re-adding stuff on submission?
[13:52:36] <Quest> just adding a new box div
[13:52:52] <duch_kazatel> then something is preventing delegation or you're mistaken about something.
[13:54:08] <Zzaichik> another click event perhaps
[13:54:25] <Zzaichik> bind/unbind
[13:54:30] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet he's using a plugin or something that prevents delegation.
[13:54:37] <Zzaichik> is that deprecated?
[13:54:49] <Zzaichik> I was think so. bootstrap pisses me off for that exact reason
[13:54:52] <duch_kazatel> yup - use "on" and "of"
[13:54:56] <duch_kazatel> *off
[13:54:57] <Zzaichik> would* think so
[13:55:25] <Zzaichik> that's what I thought, wasn't sure if bind was still available though
[13:55:52] <duch_kazatel> it's available but i wouldn't use it.
[13:56:12] <Zzaichik> yeah
[13:56:16] <Zzaichik> true enough
[13:56:20] <Zzaichik> bad idea
[13:56:34] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  i just added one function in similar way as you said. that is $('.task').draggable();     inside  $('.board').on('click', '.box', function(){      . it worked.  i can drage the task of newly created box. so the .on works. but why not for dropdown arrow?
[13:57:08] <duch_kazatel> how are you adding the dropdown arraw?
[13:57:10] <duch_kazatel> *arrow
[13:57:22] <duch_kazatel> and is it in the right class in the markup?
[13:57:47] <Quest> the static boxes work on page load.....
[13:58:01] <Quest> they and the new box just stop working when the new box is added
[13:58:16] <duch_kazatel> then your event binding is all wrong.
[13:58:19] <duch_kazatel> bind once.
[13:58:20] <duch_kazatel> to a parent
[13:58:20] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  the addition is straigh forward in the code
[13:58:34] <duch_kazatel> apparently it isn't because you're somehow unbinding things.
[13:59:09] <Quest> unbinding? if so. the  $('.task').draggable();  should also have crashed. but it is working
[13:59:17] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:59:23] <duch_kazatel> THEN I'M THE RETARD HERE.
[13:59:25] <Quest> oh you said. contrary
[14:00:18] <Quest> look. iam using same code for static box and same for new dom box element.     what can be wrong
[14:00:39] <duch_kazatel> have you tried simplified evertyhing down to replicate the problem?
[14:01:00] <duch_kazatel> remove everything else and try to do it outside of that context?
[14:03:57] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  look again
[14:04:01] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:04:05] <Quest> changed the page
[14:04:09] <duch_kazatel> that's nice
[14:04:21] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:04:34] <duch_kazatel> sorry dude, i'm not going to parse through all of your code and stuff.
[14:04:52] <Zzaichik> ^^ no one in their right mind will
[14:07:10] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  thanks for the time. really!
[14:07:16] <Quest> :)
[14:07:28] <duch_kazatel> you really need to learn about events, event binding, event delegation...
[14:07:36] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[14:07:41] <duch_kazatel> this is a good place to learn.
[14:08:04] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:08:07] <duch_kazatel> this place is good too.
[14:08:46] <duch_kazatel> but asking people to log into your app to have them troubleshoot for you is a little too far imo.
[14:10:24] <Quest> i read that. but iam really clue less. thanks for the support. I dont want to insist more to you :)
[14:10:37] <duch_kazatel> what doesn't make sense?
[14:12:03] <Quest> why would the dropdown thing dont work. while other things like $('.task').draggable(); works in the same method
[14:12:16] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  this doesnt makes sense^
[14:12:28] <duch_kazatel> you're missing something basic.
[14:14:05] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  may be .create-box-wizard is one class for all boxes. and if one is clicked. the trigger goest to all boxes and it messes up?
[14:14:17] <duch_kazatel> yet again
[14:14:23] <duch_kazatel> you're not understanding how events work.
[14:14:26] <Quest> $(".creat-box-wizard").click(function () {
[14:14:26] <Quest>                     $( "#box-creation-form" ).dialog( "open" );
[14:14:30] <duch_kazatel> okay let's break this down.
[14:14:42] <duch_kazatel> so .on() binds an event listener
[14:15:49] <duch_kazatel> so when you say $('.myElement').on('click', function(){}), you're binding a listener to all instances of .myElement that's listening for all click events.
[14:15:50] <PhaseCode|HOME> duch_kazatel: whats your programming level bro, no offense but this is really basic stuff.
[14:17:02] <duch_kazatel> if you instead go $('.myElement').on('click', '.anotherElement', function(){}), you're binding a listener to each instance of .myElement that looks for any clicks on child '.anotherElement'.
[14:17:10] <duch_kazatel> this is called delegation.
[14:17:24] <duch_kazatel> and PhaseCode|HOME wut.  the other dude is the confused one.
[14:17:44] <PhaseCode|HOME> I dunno, theres just so much bickering lol.
[14:18:11] <duch_kazatel> "<Quest> duch_kazatel,  may be .create-box-wizard is one class for all boxes. and if one is clicked. the trigger goest to all boxes and it messes up?"
[14:18:25] <duch_kazatel> homeslice doesn't understand event delegation basics.
[14:19:30] <duch_kazatel> trying to give him resources to learn and he keeps saying that he doesn't understand.
[14:19:30] * Quest still wonders the reason
[14:19:55] <duch_kazatel> quest perhaps you're not binding correctly.
[14:20:25] <duch_kazatel> what's the class on the arrow?
[14:21:52] <PhaseCode|HOME> teach him about composition
[14:21:57] <PhaseCode|HOME> that'll help xD
[14:22:23] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  class="drop-menu-button"
[14:22:24] <duch_kazatel> trying doing something like $('body').on('click', '.theArrowClass', function(){ console.log($(this)); });
[14:22:41] <duch_kazatel> then it'd be $('body').on('click', '.drop-menu-button', function(){ console.log($(this)); });
[14:22:55] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  observation: when one black arrow clicked while its expaneded .      all black arrows of all boxes contract
[14:23:26] <duch_kazatel> Quest what's the code to close the boxes?
[14:23:47] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like you're targeting the class and not your current context./
[14:24:51] <ezakimak_work> anyone know a simple way to get jgrowl 'close all' to display at the top of the list rather than at the bottom?
[14:25:00] <Quest> $('.drop-menu-button').click(function() {
[14:25:00] <Quest>                                         $('.drop-menu-options',this).toggle();
[14:25:00] <Quest>                                     });
[14:28:10] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  class="drop-menu-button"     is the arrow
[14:30:46] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  changing this line , makes changed effects on arrow. i think this is not optimized. $('.board').on('click', '.box', function(){
[14:31:12] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  see you tomorrow
[14:36:47] <Shidash> Hi, I don't know much/any jquery, but I'm trying to get cascading/dependent collection selects working in a rails app, which apparently requires jquery. I'm following the guide at http://www.petermac.com/rails-3-jquery-and-multi-select-dependencies/ but I keep getting SyntaxError: reserved word "function" due to the code at http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=m3mMyiNbli
[14:38:28] <Shidash> Should I be changing function to something else? That part is exactly the same as the tutorial and I don't know enough jquery to know what to do with that error
[14:44:01] <ingof> maybe you have to set the semicolon?
[14:44:13] <ingof> adhoc i dont see a mistake
[14:45:39] <ingof> end of line 8
[14:45:53] <Shidash> hm, I tried that and there wasn't any change in the error
[14:46:08] <ingof> hm
[14:46:34] <Shidash> I did remove an if statement from the example because it wasn't necessary for my code (they wanted to show states only if the country is the US, I want to show calls no matter what the plugin is), so it is possible I did something wrong there
[14:48:17] <duch_kazatel> Shidash whihc line?
[14:48:23] <duch_kazatel> *which line are you getting the error on?
[14:49:16] <raj> can I extend the jquery placeholder so that it makes all selects do something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/select-placeholder
[14:50:42] <Shidash> duch kazatel: The error message is SyntaxError: reserved word "function"   (in /home/shidash/2013-2014/Code/ToolkitBase/TransparencyToolkit/app/assets/javascripts/steps.js.coffee) (which is the file I pasted). Unfortunately the only line number it gives me is the line where I include that js file in on of the rails view files- <%= javascript_include_tag "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js", "rails.jquery.js
[14:50:48] <Shidash> even though it says the error is in the js file
[14:52:25] <lasha> YOOOO PEOPLE
[14:52:30] <lasha> I have a major major
[14:52:35] <lasha> optimization need.
[14:52:43] <Shidash> and the chat on the pad is closing, but plugin wouldn't have a value on the page I'm loading since it hasn't been selected on the form yet
[14:54:39] <lasha> I have 900 elements on a page that I need to retrieve the .offset() of.
[14:54:52] <lasha> But it locks the window until it's done.
[14:55:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: are you using .each
[14:55:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> by any chance
[14:55:51] <duch_kazatel> woah
[14:55:52] <lasha> uhh, i forgot. lemme check… lol
[14:55:57] <duch_kazatel> dude
[14:55:58] <duch_kazatel> 900?
[14:56:01] <lasha> yes. LOL
[14:56:11] <duch_kazatel> holy christ.
[14:58:25] <jedimind> whyyy
[14:58:34] <jedimind> in gods name
[14:58:55] <lasha> yes, using .each
[14:59:12] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: yes, i am.
[15:00:05] <ingof> lasha: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340589/javascript-are-loops-really-faster-in-reverse
[15:00:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^
[15:01:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ingof: interesting
[15:01:37] <ingof> its worth to test it :)
[15:02:21] <lasha> so i can't use native loop constructs
[15:02:25] <lasha> as this is a jquery plugin. lol
[15:02:44] <lasha> otherwise i do things natively.
[15:03:57] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:04:00] <duch_kazatel> why can't you?
[15:04:20] <lasha> well, it's not the loop that's the problem, guys
[15:04:21] <duch_kazatel> shove things into an array - you'll thank yourself later.
[15:04:25] <lasha> it's the .offset() method
[15:04:34] <lasha> that's the expensive operation
[15:04:36] <ingof> aaah
[15:04:36] <lasha> that's done 900 times
[15:04:42] <duch_kazatel> why are you trying to get the offset of 900 items?
[15:04:51] <ingof> but the 900 items dont have the same offset right ?
[15:05:11] <lasha> wait….
[15:05:17] <lasha> FUCKING GENIUS!!!!!
[15:05:20] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:05:30] <lasha> ingof: YOU JUST SOLVED MY PROBLEM
[15:05:32] <lasha> lol
[15:05:37] <ingof> lol
[15:05:37] <lasha> i dunno how i didn't think of this.
[15:05:51] <lasha> all items have the same left offset
[15:05:57] <lasha> so if i just determined ONE
[15:05:58] <duch_kazatel> what int he world is this anyway?
[15:05:59] <ingof> serious ?
[15:06:07] <lasha> and then applied that to everything else separately, that's it
[15:06:21] <ingof> lulz
[15:06:25] <lasha> i'm lucky, though
[15:06:32] <lasha> cause in other scnearios, all items WOULD have different offsets.
[15:06:40] <lasha> that's why this functionality exists
[15:06:47] <lasha> but yea. lucky this time. hahaha
[15:06:51] <lasha> maybe not so much next time lol
[15:08:49] <lasha> ahhh
[15:08:51] <lasha> now to implement.
[15:10:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> T of F -> using for loop is better than using a foreach loop
[15:10:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> in terms of time
[15:10:35] <duch_kazatel> simple for loops are awesome.
[15:11:44] <ingof> *word*
[15:13:47] <johngilbrough> Pulling my hair out here.  This is my first attempt at jQuery/Ajax/Python.  I've assembled what I think is the simplest possible .html/.py pair but I cannot, for the life of me, get them to work.  Could one of you experts please have a gander at http://pastie.org/private/czdmkr1fnnn8duhb8stuw?  Thank you.
[15:15:30] <lasha> just a quick check, who knows about the default positioning of a fixed element when top/left/right/bottom properties aren't specified?
[15:17:38] <duch_kazatel> lasha what do you mean?
[15:18:00] <ingof> lasha: top-left in parent container
[15:18:35] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Fixed_positioning
[15:25:36] <raj> Mr. Sshoky?
[15:25:51] <zakj> johngilbrough: just a shot in the dark: JSON specifies wrapping strings in double quotes, but python's representation of a dict (what you get when you "print result") will use single quotes. you could try "import json; print json.dumps(result)" instead. otherwise, let us know what you're seeing that you didn't expect
[15:28:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: isnt the positioning when  top/left/right/bottom properties  are not set position: static
[15:28:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that stays to top left corner
[15:28:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> or tries as much as possible unless blocked by another element
[15:30:40] <jphase> http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/1/2/e207bef2-7a8b-44a6-84e6-c8f7f117b46b.jpg
[15:42:55] <johngilbrough> zakj - I made the "import json ..." change you suggested but nothing got effected.   The problem overall is that I'm not seeing any effect.  The "easy" file is not getting created and the success alert() in easy.html never happens.
[15:43:34] <zakj> johngilbrough: do you see source code when you navigate your browser directly to /scratch/easy.py, or something else?
[15:44:09] <luke_man> test
[15:44:28] <luke_man> sleep
[15:44:41] <johngilbrough> zakj - I get a blank white page that gets filled in with the lines "here we go" and "got this far".
[15:45:13] <zakj> johngilbrough: that sounds like /scratch/easy.html; can you try /scratch/easy.py?
[15:45:21] <johngilbrough> btw - is there some character I should prefix "zakj" with so it stands out on your end?
[15:45:52] <zakj> nope, including my nick highlights your text in my client
[15:46:28] <johngilbrough> zakj - dialing up easy.py shows the source verbatium
[15:47:26] <zakj> johngilbrough: figured as much. that means you're missing some apache configuration
[15:47:29] <Eol> How are these two different: var template1="<div class="..."   and var template2 = document.getElementById("post_renderer_template").html()
[15:47:38] <Eol> and is there a way I can make template2 act like template1 ?
[15:48:29] <johngilbrough> zakj - I'm using a ScriptAlias to identify this directory to apache.  I need more than that?
[15:49:36] <johngilbrough> zakj - this is making sense...  Thank you sir
[15:50:13] <zakj> no problem, good luck!
[16:06:57] <sunbeam> how do I check if a certain element is a 100px or less away from the top of the window?
[16:07:30] <jphase> sunbeam: if($('.myelement').scrollTop() <= 100)
[16:09:39] <sunbeam> jphase: hmm strange
[16:09:49] <PhaseCode|HOME> Hey jphase!
[16:09:49] <jphase> sunbeam: no worky?
[16:09:56] <sunbeam> so this literally means that the element, has to be from top 100 of the top of the window right?
[16:09:57] <jphase> hey PhaseCode, how ya doin?
[16:10:11] <sunbeam> i mean 100px from the browser window top away
[16:10:13] <sunbeam> or less
[16:10:26] <jphase> sunbeam: yeah, 0-100px away from top
[16:10:48] <sunbeam> hmm its at the bottom
[16:11:00] <sunbeam> even not visible yet
[16:11:33] <sunbeam> jphase: if($('.images-list li:nth-child(1) img').scrollTop() <= 100) {
[16:11:40] <sunbeam> this is what i test
[16:12:25] <jphase> sunbeam: by not visible yet, what do you mean exactly? Is it a dynamically create element?
[16:13:17] <sunbeam> no
[16:13:22] <sunbeam> i mean that i need to scroll down to see it
[16:13:33] <sunbeam> jphase: if($('footer').scrollTop() <= 100) {
[16:13:35] <sunbeam> i get the same here
[16:13:44] <jphase> hmm, sec
[16:17:24] <jphase> sunbeam: my bad, that's for the window
[16:17:51] <jphase> sunbeam: if($('.images-list li:nth-child(1) img').offset().top <= 100) {
[16:18:21] <jphase> well, not for the "window", just for the element's scroll position... brain is messed up from salesforce atm
[16:18:52] <sunbeam> ahhh of course
[16:18:54] <sunbeam> sorry
[16:18:55] <sunbeam> thanks
[16:19:16] <PhaseCode|HOME> Sorry for the late reply: but yea, doing good :) payday friday
[16:20:10] <sunbeam> also dont work jphase
[16:20:38] <jphase> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/eyyv5/
[16:21:11] <jphase> possibly your selector sunbeam?
[16:21:26] * jphase *payday dance*
[16:21:51] <sunbeam> jphase: also tried footer as selector but its never true
[16:22:06] <sunbeam> jphase: can you imagine something that should always be true?
[16:22:49] <jphase> sunbeam: is it an absolute positioned element?
[16:22:59] <sunbeam> jphase: no
[16:23:15] <jphase> sunbeam: does it have a "top" css property despite it not being absolute?
[16:23:44] <sunbeam> jphase: neither
[16:23:47] <sunbeam> if($('footer').offset().bottom == 100) {}
[16:23:50] <sunbeam> this should be true right jphase ?
[16:23:59] <sunbeam> when I scroll down
[16:24:10] <jphase> sunbeam: well try not to match it exactly
[16:24:17] <jphase> oh
[16:24:19] <jphase> .bottom
[16:24:24] <jphase> no such thing
[16:24:35] <jphase> .top = top and bottom, .left = left and right
[16:28:32] <sunbeam> ahh sorry
[16:29:02] <sunbeam> if($('footer').offset().top < 100) { } ?
[16:29:03] <sunbeam> this then
[16:29:26] <jphase> sunbeam: that should be elements from 0-99 yeah
[16:29:26] <sunbeam> or if($('footer').offset().top < 1000) {
[16:29:34] <sunbeam> 0-99px ?
[16:29:37] <jphase> yeah
[16:29:50] <sunbeam> so when the footer is less than 1000 px
[16:29:52] <sunbeam> from the window top
[16:29:56] <sunbeam> this should be true right?
[16:29:59] <jphase> right
[16:30:09] <sunbeam> very strange
[16:31:51] <sunbeam> jphase: if($('footer').offset().top < 1000) { alert("test"); } this is what I test
[16:32:40] <jphase> sunbeam: this requires there to be some sort of vertical positioning on the page though
[16:33:07] <jphase> like... footer would need some sort of margin-top or top position for that offset to be true, let me look at some code that I have to check otherwise
[16:34:11] <sunbeam> sure! thanks
[16:34:14] <jphase> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/eyyv5/1/
[16:36:03] <sunbeam> jphase: hmm but i cannot set a margin on this element
[16:36:23] <sunbeam> I need to simply know, at the moment i am scrolling
[16:36:25] <jphase> sunbeam: as long as another element pushes it down the page, it should work
[16:36:40] <sunbeam> when a certain img is just like 100px away from browser top
[16:36:40] <jphase> sunbeam: sec, let me fiddle something for you
[16:38:37] <sunbeam> ok
[16:41:23] <jphase> sunbeam: this will make the blue box stick to the top of the screen when you scroll to it:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/eyyv5/2/
[16:43:35] <sunbeam> jphase: exactly what I needed thanks!!!
[16:43:44] <sunbeam> this works
[16:44:01] <jphase> ;)
[16:48:01] <Criten> Hey, does anyone here use transit? I'm wondering if there is a way to tell if it's using css3 or the fallback
[16:48:19] <Criten> Because it doesn't seem to act and differently
[16:48:33] <Criten> just as choppy as jquery $.fn.animate
[16:49:23] <duch_kazatel> looks like it shims in fallbacks foir you.
[16:49:45] <Criten> duch_kazatel, it does.. so i want to be able to tell when it uses the fallback
[16:49:52] <sunbeam> jphase: how can i reset this back again (if its not on top (anymore) ?
[16:50:08] <jphase> sunbeam: else ;)
[16:50:12] <Criten> But I would assume mobile chrome would support it...
[16:50:13] <sunbeam>  else { $('.scrollToMe').css({position: 'inherit', top: 'auto'}); }
[16:50:14] <duch_kazatel> Criten probably have to feature detect to check manually.
[16:50:17] <sunbeam> wont work for me jphase
[16:50:22] <jphase> sec
[16:51:03] <duch_kazatel> current chrome for android supports CSS3 transitions, so they should be fine.
[16:51:50] <Criten> duch_kazatel, do you have an android device you could check something for me?
[16:52:12] <duch_kazatel> Criten maybe.
[16:52:14] <duch_kazatel> ;)\
[16:52:17] <Criten> :P
[16:52:32] <jphase> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/eyyv5/3/
[16:54:04] <jphase> alrighty, I gotta jet.... zakj, good to have you in my life on teh relay chatz   <3
[16:54:12] * zakj waves

[17:00:04] <sunbeam> thanks again jpierce
[17:00:09] <sunbeam> jphase I mean
[17:19:38] <raj> can I extend the jquery placeholder plugin so that it makes all selects do something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/select-placeholder
[17:20:18] <heshanh> is there a 100% accurate way to find if the page has scroll bars?
[17:21:59] <beachandbytes> for all browsers?
[17:22:02] <beachandbytes> probably not
[17:25:19] <heshanh> hmm
[17:25:52] <heshanh> ive got this footer div i want to keep at the bottom of the page, it works fine if i scrolling, but not for others
[17:26:12] <heshanh> i was trying to find if the page has scroll bars and attached position:abs to the div.
[17:26:29] <heshanh> also i know this is not a css channel,.sorry if its off topic
[17:26:48] <duch_kazatel> position: fixed.
[17:27:36] <defaultro> hey guys, is it wise to combine code for mobile and desktop?
[17:27:46] <defaultro> like for Ipads and also a computer
[17:28:24] <defaultro> or do you separate the code? That means, dedicated webpage for ipads/mobile devices and another server for desktop access
[17:28:29] <heshanh> fixed make the text scroll under the div. i want to keep the div always at the bottom with scrolling
[17:28:41] <duch_kazatel> defaultro depends on what your goals are.
[17:28:58] <defaultro> but what is ideal?
[17:28:59] <duch_kazatel> defaultro are you looking to make a single, responsive site?
[17:29:04] <heshanh> but eitherway i if i can find scrolling i can attach a style to make it stay at teh bottom
[17:29:06] <duch_kazatel> it totally depends.
[17:29:09] <defaultro> looks like that's how they want it
[17:29:20] <duch_kazatel> then it's one codebase that uses media queries.
[17:29:22] <defaultro> but I'm also implementign domain sharding
[17:29:32] <duch_kazatel> congrats?
[17:29:43] <defaultro> one dev told me that domain sharding is not good for ipads
[17:29:45] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with mobile?
[17:29:54] <defaultro> he said it will slow it down
[17:30:01] <defaultro> i really doubt
[17:30:15] <defaultro> because it will just connect to the same resource, just different tcp connection
[17:30:25] <tw2113> what's sharding?
[17:30:44] <defaultro> i know the added dns lookup load but that's light
[17:31:00] <duch_kazatel> compared to the concurrency yeah the dns part should be fine.
[17:31:00] <defaultro> tw2113: static1.domain.com, static2.domain.com, etc
[17:31:16] <duch_kazatel> if you want a single responsive site, don't split them out then.
[17:31:19] <duch_kazatel> one codebase.
[17:31:24] <duch_kazatel> but architect it well.
[17:31:39] <tw2113> ah
[17:31:45] <duch_kazatel> is it going to be an ecommerce type thing?
[17:32:02] <defaultro> no
[17:32:13] <defaultro> it's just for managing devices/printers
[17:32:22] <duch_kazatel> err, huh?
[17:32:23] <defaultro> it's app we're building
[17:32:26] <duch_kazatel> like, asset management?
[17:32:40] <defaultro> it's more than that. We will b able to configure the printers
[17:33:07] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[17:33:25] <duch_kazatel> that changes things a bit.
[17:34:22] <duch_kazatel> you might want dedicated ones in that case.
[17:35:33] <defaultro> ok
[17:35:40] <defaultro> wait, sorry, I was reading something
[17:35:42] <defaultro> dedicated what?
[17:35:47] <duch_kazatel> codebases.
[17:35:52] <duch_kazatel> a mobile and a desktop.
[17:35:56] <defaultro> yeah :D
[17:35:59] <duch_kazatel> or a mobile app and a desktop site.
[17:36:03] <defaultro> yup
[17:36:17] <duch_kazatel> i'd do a dedicated app (written in the platform's native language) personally.
[17:40:04] <defaultro> awesome! I just wrote my comment on our ticket :D
[17:40:37] <defaultro> I started it with "I was even wondering why our code for desktop and ipads or mobile devices are leaving in one codebase"
[17:40:42] <defaultro> :)
[17:41:10] <beancurd> the app is to manage printers and printer configurations?
[17:41:44] <beancurd> are we talking office printer/scanners or large press laser printers (dealing with jdf's and the like)
[17:48:15] <raj> ich brauche hilfe
[18:12:38] <shoky> bless you
[18:13:12] <beancurd> yep.
[18:18:56] <raj> shoky, you rascal, i've been waiting for you!
[18:21:41] <raj> I wanted to do something magic and extend the jquery placeholder plugin so that all selects on my site do something like this--> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5805194/997624
[18:21:56] <raj> also, do you think that's a bad idea?
[18:22:42] <raj> should I instead only do it for selects with a class 'gray-select' have this feature (in which case extending placeholder is probably unneccessary)
[18:24:18] <shoky> raj ill be with ya in an hour~
[18:25:44] <raj> okie dokes
[18:51:30] <TNDY> Hey guys
[18:52:03] <TNDY> If any of you are familiar iwth jQuery datatables - I've got a page where sometimes I've got more than one datatable loaded at a time.
[18:53:02] <TNDY> Initializing them goes fine. But when I call the nfDraw() function, once per ten secs in order to update the content from the AJAX source, the pager buttons start duplicating.
[18:53:12] <TNDY> When I cut the amount of datatables back down to one, the duplication stops
[18:53:23] <TNDY> Anyone familiar with this issue?
[18:55:15] <TNDY> Nevermind, the issue is gone. I think. It got a bit more complicated.
[19:10:32] <Manusoftar> guys i need to call a function which is implemented on an htm file that gets loaded into a div from the main page. how should i achieve that??
[19:19:43] <TNDY> Manusoftar, put it in <script> tags?
[19:19:49] <shoky> raj: not sure i understand what you wanna do. the plugin isn't for selects, as far as i can see.. you want to extend it to also do that thing with selects?
[19:20:33] <Manusoftar> TNDY: tried that so far.
[19:20:53] <TNDY> Well that should fix your wagon. What's the result instead?
[19:21:19] <Manusoftar> i have a div on my main site where i load other pages. I need one of those pages to call a function that is defined on the main page
[19:33:43] <traets> if i have  request.done(function(msg) { ...id like to return true here.. }   inside a function, how do i make it so the parent function returns true?
[19:34:27] <traets> since request.done() is a function itself, having return in there would just return for request.done()
[19:41:44] <drewwinget> Hello. I am using jquery's extend method to create an object hierarchy. I pass in several options, but only some of them are being attached to the child. I think it may be an asynchronous issue, but I'm hoping someone can save me from pursuing that theory if it is something simpler.
[19:45:30] <drewwinget> Here is a gist https://gist.github.com/aeschylus/6912209#file-imageview-js-L219
[19:45:47] <drewwinget> In that line, I am sending in "currentImg" as an option.
[19:46:12] <__machine> im doing an ajax POST to a /proxy/ URL on the same domain... its making a request to another domain which returns a 302 response... im rewriting the location header to http://firstdomain.com/proxy/?url=http://otherdomain.com/path/ ... but jquery is not following the redirect... the browser is, but in my ajax success function data is not the redirect target?
[19:46:28] <drewwinget> In the constructor, annotationsLayer.js, I am calling it here:https://gist.github.com/aeschylus/6912209#file-annotationlayer-js-L26
[20:17:39] <traets> if i have  request.done(function(msg) { ...id like to return true here.. }   inside a function, how do i make it so the parent function returns true?
[20:39:45] <defaultro> hey guys, when you do an app for desktop and mobile, do you combine them in single codebase?
[20:40:20] <Ungy> totally depends
[20:45:58] <raj> shoky, exactly
[20:46:59] <elvis4526> Hi, i'm trying to make an entire table draggable with jquery-ui, jquery and $( "table" ).draggable()
[20:47:02] <elvis4526> And it is not working
[20:47:03] <raj> or run a function that monitors for selects with a particular class, to do the trick described here http://stackoverflow.com/a/5805194/997624
[20:47:53] <elvis4526> I'm clicking on the table, trying to drag it and it's doing nothing
[21:04:05] <elvis4526> I just found that when I'm opening one of my dialog just before trying, it's working
[21:04:14] <elvis4526> This seems so wrong..
[21:05:12] <elvis4526> HOLY SHIT
[21:05:14] <elvis4526> I'M SO STUPID
[21:05:15] <elvis4526> LOL
[21:05:21] <elvis4526> nvm
[21:09:51] <shoky> raj: dunno man, up to you if you wanna put the time in to figure out how to extend that plugin etc...
[21:10:25] <shoky> i wouldn't bother with that select placeholder whatever thing myself
[21:21:09] <anew> not sure how but i'm getting a .length 0 for an input that is on the page
[21:21:14] <anew> the rest of the inputs all get 1
[21:26:11] <anew> doesnt help when you have two class attributes for one div
[22:04:57] <johngilbrough> I'm new to the jQuery/Ajax (Python) thing.  I got what I think is as simple an example as possible in http://pastie.org/private/cue73ngu3d1fsklf7dtgpg.  While I'm able to get the python script to execute as a result of the call from html, I'm not able to get any data from one side to the other.  Any suggestions?
[22:42:00] <johngilbrough> Don't mind, I figured it out.
[23:31:09] <weeb1e> Hi everyone
[23:31:22] <jphase> hi
[23:31:55] <weeb1e> Is there any shorter way of doing the following? filter(function() { return !$(this).find('a') })[0]
[23:32:17] <weeb1e> Ie. Is there a traversing function that returns the first match, instead of all like filter does
[23:40:30] <Deele> I have an object $('<div/>'), how do I extend it with new methods?
[23:41:14] <Deele> without affecting jq prototype
[23:41:41] <Cork> Deele: you can add pethods to the object you get
[23:41:53] <Cork> but it won't stick to the element or anything like that
[23:42:32] <Cork> var jqo = $('<div/>'); jqo.extraFunctionForThisVariableOnly = function() {};
[23:42:39] <Deele> oh, ok
[23:42:57] <Deele> can I use any of that jquery extend() stuff for this?
[23:43:08] <Cork> sure
[23:43:30] <Deele> oh, then first element should be that jqo
[23:43:32] <Cork> Deele: but note you can't use $('div'); or anything to make that work again
[23:43:53] <Cork> those function only work on that specific instance
[23:44:18] <Cork> var jqo = $.extend($('<div/>'), {}) should work
[23:45:21] <Deele> thank you
[23:54:06] <LoneSoldier728> hey does anyone know how to represent a # in regex
[23:54:30] <Clorith> \# ?
[23:54:37] <LoneSoldier728> is it that easy?
[23:54:45] <LoneSoldier728> I want to match #ABC
[23:54:46] <Clorith> or do you mean # as in number/digit?
[23:54:53] <Cork> [0-9]
[23:55:11] <LoneSoldier728> I want to be able to say find me all words that match up #AABC
[23:55:20] <LoneSoldier728> that start with
[23:55:22] <LoneSoldier728> I should say
[23:55:28] <Cork> js> print("#ABC".match(/\#ABC/)[0])
[23:55:29] <LoneSoldier728> \^#?
[23:55:33] <b-ot> Cork: #ABC
[23:55:49] <Clorith> ^\# if anything
[23:55:54] <Clorith> \ is the escape character
[23:55:57] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok
[23:55:58] <Cork> yes
[23:56:01] <LoneSoldier728> ya i want everything
[23:56:08] <LoneSoldier728> I mean I want it to just start
[23:56:11] <LoneSoldier728> with #
[23:56:14] <Cork> bah.. i keep messing up the nicks >_<
[23:56:17] <LoneSoldier728> and then w.e after it
[23:56:32] <LoneSoldier728> so ^\#
[23:56:38] <LoneSoldier728> is all i need to put for it to match all of them
[23:56:48] <Clorith> yup
[23:57:03] <LoneSoldier728> is the \ not first?
[23:57:07] <Cork> or just [0] === '#'

[23:59:00] <LoneSoldier728> 				{title: \^#}
[23:59:00] <LoneSoldier728> 			];
[23:59:00] <Cork> js> print("#ABC#A".match(/^\#./)[0])
