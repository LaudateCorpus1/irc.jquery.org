[07:33:54] <Robdgreat> I guess that was timmy's question
[11:28:45] <sydbarret> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"   onclick="event.preventDefault();document.getElementById('remove').submit();">Add Phrase</button>
[11:28:50] <sydbarret> I have that modal form button
[11:28:52] <Xatenev> hi
[11:28:59] <sydbarret> how do i send to the method the input value?
[11:29:01] <Xatenev> how do i trigger a click without the event bubbling up?
[11:29:03] <sydbarret> im using flask
[11:29:36] <Xatenev> i.e. <div><a href="something">test</a></div>    div.on('click', function() { $(this).find('a').click() });
[11:30:19] <Xatenev>  i guess i dont get around stopeventpropagation
[11:30:25] <Xatenev> ... and adding a listener on the a
[11:30:55] <nisseni> I'm making a change to a form based on a choice the user makes. This is made with $.post and then I add the new form input via html(data). However, when I later serialize the form the new inputs aren't present. Can this be fixed somehow?
[11:33:29] <Xatenev> hmm
[11:35:12] <thykka> Xatenev, why do you need to trigger a click?
[11:35:21] <thykka> can't you just call the handler directly?
[11:35:49] <Xatenev> well its the default handler
[11:36:01] <Xatenev> ie just go to the url from the <a>
[11:36:14] <Xatenev> i just redirect directly now
[11:36:16] <Xatenev> via window.location =
[11:36:26] <Xatenev> window.location = find('a').attr('href')
[11:36:41] <thykka> err.. why?
[11:36:48] <pavonia> sydbarret: What input value?
[11:36:52] <Xatenev> thykka, whats the alternative
[11:36:52] <Xatenev> :O
[11:37:07] <thykka> Xatenev, maybe just letting the link work as it does without any JS?
[11:37:16] <Xatenev> but i want the div to be clickable too
[11:37:18] <Xatenev> not just the button inside it
[11:37:26] <Xatenev> but i cant wrap the div in the <a>
[11:37:34] <thykka> why not?
[11:37:48] <sydbarret> pavonia input value from the modal form
[11:37:50] <Xatenev> cms editor refuses
[11:37:50] <Xatenev> =D
[11:38:03] <Xatenev> i could directly add it to the database but whenever someone edits it it iwll be broken
[11:38:13] <Xatenev> (edits, and save it)
[11:38:25] <thykka> Xatenev, if <a> is inside the div, and the div is positioned, can't you stretch the <a> to cover the div?
[11:38:43] <Xatenev> i dunno i dont think so?
[11:38:50] <Xatenev> theres a lot inside that div
[11:39:02] <pavonia> sydbarret: It's not clear to me what you are asking exactly, but $("#myinputelem").val() will give you the value
[11:40:04] <sydbarret> pavonia <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"   onclick="event.preventDefault();document.getElementById('remove').submit();">Add Phrase</button>
[11:40:31] <sydbarret> pavonia im using this https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/
[11:43:47] <pavonia> So?
[11:44:14] <sydbarret> pavonia so my button submit the form but how can i send the value of the input box
[11:44:58] <sydbarret> im using flask so it needs to have the value when request.form
[11:45:45] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret are you trying to send ajax?
[11:45:47] <pavonia> What wrong about $("#myinputelem").val()?
[11:47:00] <sydbarret> pavonia yes but where do i put that
[11:47:21] <pavonia> In the onclick handler, I guess
[11:48:12] <sydbarret> pavonia you mean like this ? <button type="button" onclick="event.preventDefault();document.getElementById('remove').submit( $("#myinputelem").val());">Add Phrase</button>  ?
[11:48:32] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret .submit() either submits a form element or binds an event handler.
[11:48:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't pass an input value.
[11:49:06] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret are you trying to submit that form via ajax?
[11:49:39] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees im using a modal form with user fill through input value, i want that value be visible in the server or flask method
[11:49:46] <robertmaxrees> that does not answer my question :)
[11:49:50] <pavonia> If that input element isn't part of the form, you can add an hidden input and set the value to that
[11:50:11] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees dont care the method you send it as long i can have it available to process it
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> also: you're mixing and matching jquery and native js, which is going to cause headaches.
[11:50:47] <robertmaxrees> do you care if the page reloads?
[11:51:06] <sydbarret> it can reload fine
[11:51:21] <robertmaxrees> so then put an input element inside the form you have and populate it with the value.
[11:51:31] <robertmaxrees> submitting the form normally will then work fine.
[11:52:36] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees im using a modal popup form launched from the main form so you are saying to copy the input value of the modal form into a hidden input value in the main form?
[11:53:00] <robertmaxrees> the input value simply needs to wind up in an input within a form you're submitting.
[11:53:14] <robertmaxrees> *within the form that you're submitting.
[11:54:18] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees check this https://pasteboard.co/IdCctJ2.png
[11:54:31] <robertmaxrees> screenshots are unhelpful.
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> what about my statement is confusing?
[11:54:54] <sydbarret> yes
[11:55:05] <robertmaxrees> reread what i just said pls ;)
[11:55:22] <sydbarret> i dont know what is wind up
[11:55:31] <sydbarret> if you dont put pseudocode its difficult
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> okay so you have a form that you're submitting, right?
[11:56:01] <sydbarret> yes through the onclick event of the modal form
[11:56:17] <sydbarret> as you can see above
[11:56:30] <robertmaxrees> that screenshot tells me nothign about your implementation details :)
[11:56:39] <sydbarret> no i meant
[11:56:41] <sydbarret>         <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"   onclick="event.preventDefault();document.getElementById('remove').submit();">Add Phrase</button>
[11:56:53] <robertmaxrees> anyway - so the only data that gets submitted with a normal form are form controls (like inputs) that are within the form itself.
[11:57:22] <robertmaxrees> so if you need to add data, then you need to append an input to the form with the correct value.
[11:57:55] <robertmaxrees> so your first step is to append an input to the "main form"
[11:58:30] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees like a hidden input?
[11:58:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:58:39] <robertmaxrees> that's one way :)
[11:58:58] <sydbarret> ok now how do i sent the value from the modal to that hidden input
[11:59:43] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to approach this.  the easiest is to select the element, then use .val() to get the value.  then use .val() on the new input in the main form to set it.
[12:00:19] <robertmaxrees> so something like var theModalValue = $('.someThing').val();  $('.theNewInputInTheMainForm').val(theModalValue);
[12:01:15] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees yes but where do i put that?
[12:01:27] <robertmaxrees> within the click handler for the button.
[12:02:00] <sydbarret> you mean to add a function call there?
[12:02:28] <sydbarret> like <button type="button"    onclick="event.preventDefault();document.getElementById('remove').submit( FUNCTION() );">Add Phrase</button>   ?
[12:02:35] <robertmaxrees> that would be better that what you're doing now.  even better still is to use jquery's .on() to bind the listener.
[12:02:47] <robertmaxrees> since your onclick is about to get very complex and unreadable.
[12:03:24] <sydbarret> what would be the sintax can you show in the html i gave you?
[12:04:05] <sydbarret> is that inside submit() i dont know how to tie your code to the onclick
[12:04:08] <robertmaxrees> you would remove the entire onclick="everything here" and put it in a js file instead.  http://learn.jquery.com/events/ is a great primer on the subject of event handlers.
[12:04:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:04:22] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/ this even shows you the basics.
[12:19:28] <mydog2> hi.  novice to jquery. so i apologize up front.  looking over examples/google to get a feel for how to solve an issue. I've got a chunk of html, contains a div with "ul/li" the div has a class <div class="foo"> one of the "li" may have  a class with "active". I'm trying to figure out how to remove the "active" from the class from the li that's in the div
[12:19:56] <mydog2> a sample of the html is  --->>>   https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/AFITm-WACA-M9RAz52bZXg
[12:20:07] <robertmaxrees> mydog2 so you just wanna remove the active class from any element within .foo?
[12:21:16] <mydog2> hi robertmaxrees -- close.. want to remove the "active" from the "li" in some cases the class might have foo/dog in the class along with the active..
[12:21:33] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - you just want to remove the active class, right?
[12:21:38] <mydog2> from everything i'm seeing.. this should be really simple
[12:21:43] <robertmaxrees> it is :)
[12:21:49] <mydog2> robertmaxrees, -- yeah!
[12:22:00] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo').find('.active').removeClass('active') ;)
[12:22:15] <mydog2> great.. cause i've got another issue that's prob just as simple once i get this..
[12:24:54] <mydog2> robertmaxrees, -- so ... $('.page-sidebar-wrapper noprint').find('.active').removeClass('active') ;)
[12:25:12] <robertmaxrees> not sure what's with that noprint in there
[12:25:27] <mydog2> where the .page-sidebar... is the class for the parent div
[12:25:38] <robertmaxrees> what's with the random 'noprint'?
[12:26:05] <mydog2> <div class="page-sidebar-wrapper noprint">   <<<
[12:26:15] <mydog2> this is the actual div
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> so that's noot how selectors work :)
[12:26:41] <mydog2> ohhh... so i could just leave off the noprint..
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> $('.page-sidebar-wrapper noprint') is trying to select <noprint> within an element that has 'page-sidebar-wrapper' as a class.
[12:26:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just leave off the noprint.
[12:28:01] <mydog2> hmm.. leaving off the "noprint" then gets multiple matching divs.. let me try
[12:28:19] <robertmaxrees> so you want one that has both .page-sidebar-wrapper AND .noprint?
[12:28:43] <mydog2> yeah.. that would/should be "more" precise
[12:28:57] <robertmaxrees> then .page-sidebar-wrapper.noprint
[12:30:30] <mydog2> ohh.. so the "." is the "and" for jquery class designations..
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:30:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:30:39] <mydog2> or "selectors"
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> a lack of space is :)
[12:30:49] <robertmaxrees> the period means class
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> '.foo .bar' means "all .bar within .foo"
[12:31:01] <mydog2> right.. my bad..
[12:31:10] <robertmaxrees> '.foo.bar' means "all .foo that is also .bar"
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> have you checked out learn.jquery.com?
[12:32:10] <mydog2> robertmaxrees, -- not enough!... i'm making a few "quick" test/changes to test a couple of changes.
[12:32:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:16:18] <bs0d> Hi all
[13:16:22] <robertmaxrees> good morning!
[13:16:45] <bs0d> I added JQuery CDN to <script> tag, but Firefox tells me "Request to access cookie or storage was blocked because we are blocking all third-party storage access requests and content blocking is enabled."
[13:17:00] <robertmaxrees> what link did you use?
[13:17:12] <bs0d> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[13:17:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not the jQuery CDN fwiw :)
[13:18:01] <bs0d> Oh, I've found this URL in one of the stackoverflow responses
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> googleapis.com - that's google's CDN
[13:18:52] <robertmaxrees> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js would be jquery's
[13:19:34] <bs0d> thanks a lot! Its my first JQuery experience, so I had no clue which CDN was the correct one. Should go immediately to the official website
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there's no "correct" one.
[13:20:01] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that the other one is googles.
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> *google's
[13:20:12] <robertmaxrees> (also it's jQuery, not JQuery :) )
[13:35:48] <andreas31> What is the most jQuery:ish way, inside a submit event handlar, to get the submit button (among several belonging to the same form) that was clicked/keyboard-pressed to trigger the submit event?
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange thing to want to do - why do you have multiple submit buttons?
[13:37:40] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: Because I want the form to work even for browsers without javascript, and I have both a Save-button and a Delete-button.
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> i would rethink that UI - a checkbox or other form control to denote things you want to delete and then a "save" button is a much better solution that will work with and without javascript.
[13:40:37] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: Hmm, why? Then the user would have to click twice in order instead of once, requiring extra work for the user.
[13:40:51] <robertmaxrees> how are you planning on sending over which button was clicked without JS?
[13:40:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> also allows users to update multiple records at once.
[13:41:13] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: By using the formaction attribute for each button. :)
[13:41:37] <robertmaxrees> you could wrap that version in a <noscript> tag :shrug:
[13:42:35] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: Yes, but that would complicate the frontend code by requiring extra code for the non-javascript case. :-/
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you have two separate handlers - one for the form submit and one for the delete button click.
[13:43:53] <robertmaxrees> though i'm surprised you have that many users without JS enabled.
[13:43:58] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: In addition, I don't think there is any need for the user to be able to update multiple records at once. I think it is more importan that the user see the result of his/her change immediately.
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: alright.
[13:44:58] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: I just want to write portable frontend code that work across all browsers. But maybe I am overly ambitious in that sense? :)
[13:45:32] <robertmaxrees> heh i'd question your assumption that you need to support users that don't have js enabled.
[13:45:41] <robertmaxrees> i would bet that number is much smaller than you think.
[13:45:54] <robertmaxrees> it's a noble cause, but likely not worth the extra effort.
[13:47:32] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: Hmm, yes, probably you're right. :) I just thought that there would be an easy way to accomplish it. However, if it's complicated I will probably just assume that the user has javascript enabled...
[13:47:49] <robertmaxrees> i just told you one way to do it :shrug: but i may not worry about it.
[13:48:55] <andreas303> robertmaxrees: Ah, yes, but I think I will take your advice and ignore the non-JS-users anyway. :)
[13:49:03] <robertmaxrees> rad :)
[13:59:33] <Taplar> <noscript>You have javascript turned off.  Whoop whoooooop...</noscript>
[14:02:51] <bs0d> am I getting it right that to change the text of a button inside a click handler I can use $('button_id').text('new_text')?
[14:03:08] <Taplar> what's the click handler on?
[14:04:03] <Taplar> is it on the button you want to change the text for?
[14:04:20] <bs0d> Taplar yes, and it is a separate function, not in-line
[14:04:50] <Taplar> and are we talking about an <input type="button"> or a <button> ?
[14:05:41] <Taplar> <input> or <button> ?
[14:06:09] <bs0d> just <button>
[14:06:23] <Taplar> this.innerText = 'new text' or $(this).text('new text')
[14:07:13] <Taplar> "this" inside the event handler, since it is on the button(s), will point to the button the event is being processed on.  So no need to look it up again.
[14:09:11] <bs0d> I've created a demo here: https://jsfiddle.net/981d4nxh/
[14:09:42] <bs0d> in myBtnClick handler I tried to run $(btnId).text("Clicked"); but it did not change the text
[14:09:48] <bs0d> I must be missing something
[14:09:49] <Taplar> I thought you said it was not inline
[14:09:54] <Taplar> you are doing an inline
[14:10:20] <bs0d> Taplar yes, the myBtnClick is a separate function, not defined inside button creation code
[14:10:37] <Taplar> that's not what denotes an inline vs a non-inline
[14:10:55] <Taplar> anything that uses the `onclick` attribute or property of an element, is an inline
[14:11:03] <bs0d> Taplar oh, sorry for mixing terminology up
[14:11:12] <Taplar> a non-inline is an event handler that is bound with addEventListener or the jquery on() method
[14:12:24] <Taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/beo1ah76/
[14:13:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f57bwrqj/ using jsfiddle the way you should
[14:13:34] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with that "clicking" var?
[14:15:32] <bs0d> robertmaxrees, that's the second step, the button will change its color and position in a loop
[14:16:24] <bs0d> Taplar, did I get it right that by the time the click handler was called the DOM was not updated, and there is no button id I was looking for?
[14:16:37] <bs0d> so I need to use $(this) instead
[14:17:06] <Taplar> No, I changed it to use on(), so it would be a logically bound event handler, and at that point the 'this' is the element the event handler is processing for
[14:17:28] <Taplar> You don't really care about the id at that point
[14:18:05] <Taplar> optionally you could accept the e(vent) on the handler method and e.target would be the same thing
[14:19:04] <bs0d> Taplar sorry for being annoying, what is the difference between button.on('click',handler) and {...,click: handler} that I was using previously?
[14:19:40] <Taplar> i need to double check, but i'm pretty sure the { 'click', method } is setting up an inline binding
[14:19:52] <z1haze> can someone help me understand when i need to stopPropagation and when i need to stopImmediatePropagation
[14:19:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:20:15] <Taplar> z1haze immediate propagation is for the same element
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> z1haze check the docs :) one prevents subsequently bound event handlers, the other one prevents handlers on parent elements./
[14:20:35] <robertmaxrees> bs0d the one you were using is setting the onClick DOM node property.
[14:20:40] <z1haze> use case, i have an element with a button usinga particular class name. I am appending a new element to the div with the same class. I want the new button to not do what the previous one did
[14:20:46] <z1haze> i did. that's why im asking here. im just unclear on it
[14:20:49] <z1haze> guess im dumb
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> z1haze can you share a fiddle or something?
[14:21:04] <Taplar> that doesn't sound like a use case
[14:21:09] <z1haze> eh
[14:21:18] <Taplar> immediate propagation would be if you had one element, with multiple event handlers of the same type
[14:21:26] <Taplar> say you had a button with two click handlers
[14:21:37] <Taplar> if you stopped immediate propagation in the first one, it would not execute the second
[14:21:56] <z1haze> what about stopping the first one
[14:22:08] <Taplar> you can't really stop that one
[14:22:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:22:20] <Taplar> if you want to stop it, remove it, :)
[14:22:32] <z1haze> :(
[14:22:43] <Taplar> i mean, why leave it if it should be stopped?
[14:22:48] <z1haze> only in this scenario.
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> the scenario doesn't change anything.
[14:23:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't reach back in the event handler queue.
[14:23:26] <robertmaxrees> you can either remove all handlers or modify the original one to not fire given some criteria.
[14:23:30] <robertmaxrees> there's also .one(), etc.
[14:23:42] <z1haze> lets say you have a modal.. the modal has a cancel button. this modal has the potential to load in new content in an overlay with another cancel button. when clicking the second cancel button i only want to remove the overlay. when clicking the first cancel button it closes the modal
[14:23:53] <z1haze> ill just use a different class
[14:23:55] <z1haze> thanks.
[14:24:13] <Taplar> sure, you don't attach handlers to things that shouldn't fire those handlers....
[14:24:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:24:49] <Taplar> stopping propagation in that case would be ignoring that you have a logic issue
[15:27:28] <mydog2> hey robertmaxrees ! .. ok.. that worked.. good lord. interruptions.!!
[15:27:30] <al_nz1> Anyone able to see whats going wrong here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56018332/javascript-typeahead-after-3-characters?noredirect=1#comment98683121_56018332
[15:28:32] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 iu see a few questions and issues in that - gives us a starting point lol
[15:28:50] <robertmaxrees> is it the spring-boot piece?
[15:28:54] <al_nz1> yes
[15:29:06] <Taplar> typehead has a minLength option on the initialization
[15:29:08] <robertmaxrees> spring boot != jquery
[15:29:30] <Taplar> https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/jquery_typeahead.md#options  provided this is the correct plugin
[15:29:32] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I am not sure whether the issue is front end or backend
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 you just said it's a spring boot problem :)
[15:29:54] <al_nz1> Taplar: is not that plugin
[15:30:07] <Taplar> $("[name='query']").typeahead({
[15:30:08] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you asked if the project uses springboot
[15:30:10] <Taplar> looks like a plugin to me
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:30:29] <Taplar> so which plugin is it?
[15:30:46] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 i said "is it the spring-boot piece?", as in "is your question about the output from spring-boot?"
[15:30:59] <al_nz1> Link is in the question, https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead/blob/master/README.md
[15:31:41] <Taplar> that README also shows there is a minLength option that can be given .....
[15:32:07] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: "peice" - I am not sure what that means in this context, but the backend uses springboot. Front end jquery...and the backend is returning the data to the front end (jquery) just fine....so at this point I am focusing on the front end as holding the solution
[15:32:17] <Taplar> so if you want it to only suggest for 3 characters, give it minLength: 3
[15:32:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ listen to taplar then.
[15:32:40] <robertmaxrees> he has your solution it looks like.
[15:33:26] <al_nz1> Taplar: The example, loads the whole list by ajax from the backend, but doesnt start to filter unti you have enetered 3 characters....I am not even querying the backend until you have entered 3 characters ..... the min lengths are implimented in diffferent ways
[15:33:59] <Taplar> have you tried it?
[15:34:49] <Taplar> if it does, indeed, do that, then that would seem to be a short coming of the plugin potentially
[15:36:24] <al_nz1> Taplar: yes I have. I his example on the readme shows it being called by $.get("example_collection.json", function(data){ ----- I have added the minlength option - but when that event fires in doc ready there isnt even any text in the input field.
[15:36:55] <al_nz1> assuming that the above is in doc ready it fires at page load
[15:37:04] <Taplar> Then outside of existing options to change that behaviour, then that's just how that plugin operates.
[15:37:39] <al_nz1> Taplar: and thats what I am doing in my stack question, waiting until 3 characters to send the search term to the backend
[15:38:01] <Taplar> but you are initializing it on page load?
[15:38:04] <robertmaxrees> the plugin doesn't appear to support what you want it to do in this case.
[15:39:12] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thats why I am adding my own code, waiting until 3 characters are enetred, getting a smaller result set from backend and storing that in "data" (but note I am using POST not GET) - so I get the data back, but the quotes seem to be not playing nicely with the plugin
[15:40:06] <Taplar> the second example in your bottom snippet is invalid json
[15:40:12] <Taplar> keys have to be in double quotes
[15:40:23] <al_nz1> Taplar: and I think that is the problem....
[15:40:35] <Taplar> so is that format being returned from your endpoint?
[15:41:05] <al_nz1> Taplar: yes
[15:41:33] <Taplar> ok, then if that is a string, and not already parsed json, that's invalid response from the server
[15:42:18] <Taplar> are you getting those snippets from the `console.log(data);` ?
[15:42:55] <mydog2> robertmaxrees, -- ive got one other issue -- should be small.
[15:42:59] <mydog2> the html has
[15:43:00] <mydog2> <li class="open">
[15:43:00] <mydog2>         <a href="http://104.248.125.83/qdpm/index_ajax.php?module=overview/">
[15:43:03] <robertmaxrees> ooh yo
[15:43:09] <robertmaxrees> don't paste in the channel -0 make a fiddle :)
[15:43:19] <mydog2> no prob...
[15:43:25] <mydog2> i've got it in a paste
[15:43:26] <robertmaxrees> and no need to ask just me lol - you can ask the channel in general :)
[15:44:14] <mydog2> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/y9GyhxiJn8ULxrt3D46B6g
[15:44:32] <robertmaxrees> so i'ma flip this on its head.
[15:44:48] <robertmaxrees> first off - why do you need to do this?
[15:45:11] <mydog2> basically, i've got some text in an "a" href="dog-foo" with a parent "li"
[15:45:52] <mydog2> robertmaxrees, -- i'm looking to display the top "li" as active when a user selects a sub menu item...
[15:46:15] <robertmaxrees> mydog2 is the user going to a new page or something?
[15:46:46] <mydog2> the submenu generates new content/logic
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> mmk?  and second - it's really gross hinging logic on the contents of the href of a link, especially an event handler like this
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd scope down your handler so it only fires when you want it to.  or bind it to the li instead, then you don't need to look for the parent li :)
[15:49:44] <al_nz1> anyway I will look at the back end
[15:49:54] <Taplar> hold up man
[15:50:05] <Taplar> lol.  how are you grabbing that data for the bottom snippet?
[15:51:18] <al_nz1> Taplar: i have used console to inpsect what comes bacl
[15:51:33] <Taplar> so you did the console.log(data) ?
[15:59:27] <al_nz1> set a breakpoint, then data;
[15:59:55] <Taplar> awesome.  so do that again, and check the typeof data
[15:59:57] <Taplar> for the POST
[16:00:22] <al_nz1> is that checking whats returned?
[16:00:36] <Taplar> that will tell you the type.  string, object, etc.
[16:00:42] <Taplar> if it's string, then it's json
[16:00:48] <al_nz1> ie typeof on data?
[16:00:49] <Taplar> otherwise, it's already been parsed
[16:00:58] <Taplar> yes
[16:01:06] <Taplar> typeof data
[16:02:02] <al_nz1> it says string for "typeof data;:
[16:02:07] <al_nz1> it says string for "typeof data;"
[16:02:51] <Taplar> and that's the case where the data = [{id:113,name:"LAX"}]
[16:02:54] <Taplar> ?
[16:03:44] <al_nz1> yes - that data only has the quotes around the string values
[16:04:06] <Taplar> ok, so yeah if the typeof that variable is saying string, then yes, the endpoint is returning malformed json
[16:04:54] <al_nz1> wait
[16:06:31] <al_nz1> sorry, I made a mistake, I had a extra line of code I had put in there testing what was coming back. It says object. If I inspect the object only the values that are string are enclosed in quotes
[16:06:50] <Taplar> then that means the endpoint is returning valid json, and it's already parsed
[16:07:33] <al_nz1> Taplar: but doesnt JSON need " on the keys too?
[16:07:52] <Taplar> it did have them.  if it didn't, jQuery could not have auto parsed it for you
[16:08:33] <Taplar> so if you are saying that a GET version to the same endpoint returns a string data, and the POST version to the same endpoint we have now confirmed is giving you a parsed object
[16:08:43] <al_nz1> well I dont know why its not working then. I can share my screen with you if that helps?
[16:08:48] <Taplar> that means the POST version is setting the content-type on the response to json, so jQuery knows to auto parse it.
[16:08:50] <Taplar> and the GET is not
[16:09:11] <Taplar> i'm currently at work so I can't really do screen sharing stuff
[16:09:18] <al_nz1> so just comment out the content-type ?
[16:09:25] <Taplar> huh?
[16:09:40] <robertmaxrees> they're bouncing back and forth between here and ##javascript
[16:09:47] <al_nz1> to stop the POST ajax setting content type?
[16:09:59] <Taplar> dataType: "json", <== this on your ajax request is telling jQuery the response is json
[16:10:05] <Taplar> and jQuery will try to auto parse it for you
[16:10:17] <Taplar> so the bigger question.  Do you need JSON, or a parsed object?
[16:10:18] <al_nz1> ok, so should I remove that?
[16:10:34] <al_nz1> Taplar: I need what ever that plugin needs.
[16:10:38] <Taplar> which is?
[16:11:14] <al_nz1> JSON objects it says is fine
[16:11:32] <Taplar> Not a thing.  But assuming you mean just an object, then you got it
[16:12:35] <al_nz1> "JSON objects" is a quote from the docs for the plugin
[16:12:35] <al_nz1>     @RequestMapping(value = "/findstation", method = RequestMethod.POST)
[16:12:36] <al_nz1>     public @ResponseBody List<Station> findstation(@RequestBody Station jsonSearchString) {
[16:12:36] <al_nz1>         List<Station> listStation = stationService.stationContaining(jsonSearchString.getName());
[16:12:36] <al_nz1>         return listStation;
[16:12:36] <al_nz1>     }
[16:12:38] <al_nz1> wops
[16:12:40] <al_nz1> sorry
[16:12:42] <robertmaxrees> doin't paste in channel
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:12:49] <Taplar> From the API, source should be an array or a function
[16:12:55] <Taplar> that parsed data should be an array
[16:13:06] <al_nz1> https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead/blob/master/README.md#using-json-objects-instead-of-simple-strings
[16:13:23] <Taplar> ok, I want to hurt that guy
[16:13:33] <al_nz1> the guy that wrote the plugin?
[16:13:37] <Taplar> point being, JSON is a string representation of objects.  It's not an object
[16:13:49] <Taplar> Disregarding that strings are objects.
[16:14:05] <al_nz1> Taplar: so I need to convert JSON to array?
[16:14:22] <al_nz1> (or use a different plugin like the twitter one) ?
[16:14:29] <Taplar> No, your object is [{id:113,name:"LAX"}] , yes?
[16:14:34] <al_nz1> yes
[16:14:42] <Taplar> that's already an array.  See the [] ?
[16:15:00] <al_nz1> Taplar: so then why the heck doesnt the plug seem to accept it?
[16:15:05] <al_nz1> and I get no error on console
[16:15:07] <Taplar> *shrug*
[16:15:34] <al_nz1> I wondered if I need to do something to the input to get it to populate the plugin after the ajax, but I dunno
[16:16:43] <al_nz1> Taplar: what I did find what that if I go : data = [{"id":123, "name":"LAX"}] it works
[16:17:06] <Taplar> giving it json?
[16:19:21] <al_nz1> I am giving it what I just wrote - whatever that is called
[16:19:35] <Taplar> as a string or as a parsed object?
[16:19:49] <Taplar> all you changed was quotes around the keys, which parsed objects would not have
[16:19:59] <Taplar> (typically)
[16:26:57] <al_nz1> ok, well I dont know what else to say other than by adding those quotes it worked
[16:27:08] <Taplar> how did you add the quotes?
[16:27:19] <al_nz1> I did it on the console manually
[16:27:24] <Taplar> ???
[16:27:25] <al_nz1> actually no
[16:27:32] <al_nz1> I hard coded a example
[16:27:53] <Taplar> you hardcoded: data = [{"id":123, "name":"LAX"}]
[16:27:54] <Taplar> ?
[16:28:57] <al_nz1> yes
[16:29:17] <al_nz1> to confirm the format of what the plugin expects
[16:29:34] <Taplar> Shouldn't have changed anything.  Hardcode it as data = [{id:123, name:"LAX"}] and see if it changes
[16:30:04] <Taplar> you're not understanding what is going on...
[16:30:21] <Taplar> Quotes are not requried for object syntax
[16:30:30] <Taplar> which is what var thing = {key:'value'} is
[16:30:42] <Taplar> object syntax, which is parsed when javascript compiles, is not the same as json
[16:30:55] <Taplar> json *does* require quotes
[16:31:12] <Taplar> var thing = '{"key":"value"}'
[16:31:39] <Taplar> but in both those cases, when the javascript is compiled and the object notation is turned into an object, and when json is parsed into an object, *none* of the keys have quotes
[16:32:12] <Taplar> the memory usage of the key has no requirement for the quotes as a delimiter.  It's pure syntax for the compiler/parser
[16:33:28] <Taplar> So to say you hardcoded quotes to object syntax, and it started working, to me is a red hearing
[16:33:36] <Taplar> (sp)
[16:52:15] <Al_nz> Taplar: I will reread what you just wrote.....not fully sure I understand it. At the end of the day - I still am not much closer to why its not working
[16:55:23] <Taplar> which part are you having difficulty with?
[17:00:47] <Al_nz> how I get the bit returned by ajax to work with the plugin
[17:01:13] <Taplar> I was referring more to you saying you didn't fully understand what I said.
[17:03:08] <mydog2> hi robertmaxrees .. sorry for the delay. how can i do what you suggest. any examples i can look at to see if i understand. i think i'm simply trying to figure out how to set the class="active" for the clicked href
[17:03:45] <robertmaxrees> mydog2 bind an event listener and use addClass
[17:04:21] <Al_nz> Taplar: ok
[17:05:31] <Taplar> are you still unclear on the whole object syntax/json/objects thing?
[17:05:53] <Al_nz> Taplar: yes, but I can read up on that on my own
[17:06:12] <Al_nz> JSON vs Object
[17:06:28] <Taplar> it's fairly related to the issue you are having
[17:08:45] <Taplar> think of it this way.  you're having an issue putting a bookshelf together.  and I'm saying, you're not fully understanding the difference between a philips and a flat head.
[17:09:10] <Taplar> taking time to understand the nitty gritty, will make the problem much easier.
[17:09:22] <robertmaxrees> ^ and give you the tools to deal with it in the future.
[17:11:52] <Al_nz> Taplar: indeed
[17:13:35] <Al_nz> Taplar: have you used the other plugin
[17:13:57] <Taplar> I haven't really used many typeahead plugins before
[17:13:59] <Al_nz> the one you linked to
[17:14:01] <Al_nz> ok
[17:26:29] <Flyste> var total = $("input[name='gameid[]:checked'").length
[17:26:50] <Flyste> I'm trying to return the number of checked checkboxes with that line but it always returns 0
[17:26:55] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[17:26:59] <robertmaxrees> read the second paragraph :)
[17:27:33] <robertmaxrees> $("input[name='gameid\\[\\]]:checked'")
[17:27:56] <Taplar> without the single quote after checked
[17:28:01] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah
[17:28:25] <robertmaxrees> $("input[name='gameid\\[\\]']:checked")
[17:28:47] <Taplar> though since it's in single quotes i don't think you have to escape the brackets
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> or w/e lol
[17:28:52] <robertmaxrees> you do.
[17:28:59] <Taplar> herm
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure at least.
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> even better - use .filter() with a function.
[17:29:45] <Flyste> Can I use the class?
[17:29:47] <robertmaxrees> .filter(function() { return $(this).prop('name') === 'gameid[]' })
[17:30:00] <Flyste> like $(.classname):checked ?
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> classes and ids are better for selecting, yeah.
[17:30:15] <Taplar> '.classname:checked'
[17:30:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:30:58] <Taplar> Flyste are you familiar with CSS selectors?
[17:31:06] <Flyste> Ok that was much easier
[17:31:54] <Flyste> Taplar, yeah, but not familiar enough
[17:32:13] <Taplar> k, my point with that is they follow pretty much the same pattern
[19:19:05] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees
[19:19:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:19:52] <robertmaxrees> pls don't ping me yo.  if you have a question, ask it out to the channel :)
[19:19:52] <sydbarret> https://bpaste.net/show/00ec20584035
[19:20:01] <sydbarret> we where talking
[19:20:04] <sydbarret> before
[19:20:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter lol
[19:20:15] <robertmaxrees> but what's up?
[19:20:33] <sydbarret> the stuff in link doesnt work
[19:20:38] <sydbarret> do you know why?
[19:20:52] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[19:21:13] <sydbarret> the console is the command prompt where the server is running?
[19:21:22] <robertmaxrees> in the dev tools in your browser.
[19:21:29] <sydbarret> letme check
[19:21:35] <robertmaxrees> also: don'
[19:21:40] <robertmaxrees> *don't use onclick
[19:22:23] <sydbarret> 7540:408 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null
[19:22:28] <sydbarret>     at myFunction (540:408)
[19:22:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:22:35] <sydbarret>     at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (540:318)
[19:22:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:22:51] <sydbarret> so should use the .on instead?
[19:22:54] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:23:13] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the input within the modal body from there?
[19:23:53] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret
[19:24:37] <robertmaxrees> i have to leave in a few minutes.
[19:24:40] <sydbarret> do you see the button add Phrase?
[19:24:44] <sydbarret> it has to submit the form
[19:24:52] <sydbarret> with the input value
[19:24:55] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:25:04] <robertmaxrees> could you answer the question i just asked?
[19:25:16] <sydbarret> yes
[19:25:27] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[19:25:30] <robertmaxrees> is jquery available on the page?
[19:25:32] <sydbarret> so that i can later submit the form perhaps with that value
[19:25:38] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[19:25:45] <robertmaxrees> you're playing musical requirements
[19:25:59] <sydbarret> how do you know if jquery is available?
[19:26:07] <sydbarret> isnt that automatic with the scriopt tags?
[19:26:09] <sydbarret> script
[19:26:15] <robertmaxrees> did you include it on the page?
[19:26:31] <sydbarret> the script tags? yes
[19:26:43] <robertmaxrees> what script tags?
[19:26:45] <robertmaxrees> jquery?
[19:27:01] <sydbarret> you mean the min.css stuff?
[19:27:04] <robertmaxrees> no
[19:27:11] <robertmaxrees> did you include jquery on the page?
[19:27:26] <sydbarret> i dont know
[19:27:39] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[19:27:41] <sydbarret> whats the initialization
[19:27:45] <sydbarret> $document... ?
[19:27:51] <robertmaxrees> there is none.
[19:28:05] <robertmaxrees> you usually just include it via a script tag.
[19:28:08] <sydbarret> im using bootstrap with several cdn libraries
[19:28:23] <robertmaxrees> so if you do $.fn.jquery in the developer tools, what do you get?
[19:28:42] <sydbarret> so just type that and reload?
[19:28:53] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:29:04] <robertmaxrees> go to the js console - there should be an input box
[19:29:12] <robertmaxrees> where you can type things.
[19:29:21] <sydbarret> 3.3.1
[19:29:26] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you do.
[19:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you should go to learn.jquery.com
[19:29:51] <robertmaxrees> it will teach you everything you need to know.
[19:30:17] <sydbarret> ok come back soon
[19:30:19] <robertmaxrees> from traversing the DOM to creating event bindings to ajax
[19:30:41] <sydbarret> does it have interaction with flask?
[19:30:53] <sydbarret> ok i will test some sfuff thanks
[19:31:00] <robertmaxrees> so i explained this to you the other night
[19:31:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery and flask have literally nothing to do with each other.
[19:31:25] <robertmaxrees> jquery runs in the browser - flask is server.
[19:31:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn about ajax.
[19:32:03] <sydbarret> ok
[19:32:19] <robertmaxrees> if you plan on trying to "conenct" them somehow, though if you're fine with browser reloads, then you don't need to worry about it.
[19:32:36] <sydbarret> the .on doesnt work
[19:32:38] <robertmaxrees> in which case you just need to learn about forms
[19:32:41] <robertmaxrees> define "doesn't work"
[19:32:42] <sydbarret> i have added an id to the button
[19:32:48] <robertmaxrees> that's very vague
[19:32:49] <sydbarret> but nothing shows on the console
[19:32:53] <robertmaxrees> show me code.  be more descriptiv e
[19:33:31] <sydbarret> https://bpaste.net/show/122cd6cacbc8
[19:33:52] <sydbarret> remember that button is on the modal form
[19:33:57] <robertmaxrees> $( "addphrase" ) is not how you select by id.
[19:34:15] <sydbarret> your link showed that
[19:34:20] <robertmaxrees> \where?
[19:34:20] <sydbarret> so i should add #?
[19:34:29] <sydbarret> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[19:34:44] <robertmaxrees> "p" is selecting a <p> tag
[19:35:01] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com has everything you need in it.
