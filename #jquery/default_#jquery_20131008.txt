[00:00:35] <bluemner> cool thanx. the thing is that we are going to use this script on many different pages so I can't really use an id or class, get what I mean, thats why I wants it to check for any text area
[00:01:07] <doug65536> bluemner: you need to know the absolute basics of jquery to use it on several pages
[00:01:23] <doug65536> bluemner: .is(':focus') is the answer to your question
[00:01:46] <bluemner> lol cool and ill check on event listeners
[00:01:57] <bluemner> or do I not need one then
[00:01:57] <doug65536> bluemner: what?
[00:02:06] <doug65536> bluemner: no you don't need event listeners
[00:02:10] <bluemner> ok
[00:02:36] <doug65536> bluemner: what part don't you understand? $(something).is(':focus') will return true if something has focus
[00:02:55] <doug65536> funhouse: use $('#el').spinner('option', 'max', 10000)
[00:03:20] <doug65536> ;
[00:03:38] <bluemner> mono i understand the code i just have difficulties with structuring stuff haunt done much query :)
[00:04:08] <doug65536> bluemner: in that snippet, $(self).is(':focus') is what you want to check
[00:04:32] <doug65536> bluemner: although, it is a nonsense test. how else would you get a keydown event
[00:04:51] <doug65536> bluemner: focus means you are receiving keyboard input
[00:06:10] <doug65536> funhouse: read the docs at http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#option-max  you use ("option", "max", value) to change it at runtime. the object version is ONLY for initialization
[00:06:17] <bluemner> with an event listener right? do you think thats the better way?
[00:08:19] <doug65536> bluemner: better way to do what?
[00:08:43] <bluemner> check for focus
[00:09:26] <doug65536> bluemner: it's a nonsense check. you JUST received a keydown event, therefore 'self' has focus
[00:11:04] <doug65536> bluemner: in your paste, if (true) checks if you have focus. you just received a keystroke! you have focus!
[00:11:26] <doug65536> bluemner: unless you are using hacky crap that uses .trigger('keydown'
[00:11:59] <bluemner> doug65536: aha ok so that won't work that way. shit so will it work if i put an event listener on the text area and then return false
[00:12:50] <doug65536> bluemner: no, for the 3rd time, if 'this' is a parent element, then $('textarea').is(':focus') is true if the first textarea on the whole page has focus
[00:14:37] <bluemner> aha ok so you mean thats why I don't need the event listener but why are you saying its nonsense
[00:14:52] <doug65536> bluemner: what are you going to do in a focusin handler? set a flag? then how are you going to check it? read the flag? just use .is(':focus')!
[00:15:10] <bluemner> ok
[00:15:19] <doug65536> bluemner: I'm done trying to convince you. do what you please
[00:15:59] <bluemner> no no its fine you don't need to convince me I'm just trying to understand the logic :)
[00:29:26] <bluemner> doug65536: so this should do the trick ?
[00:29:29] <bluemner> doug65536: https://pastee.org/h4ugc
[00:30:53] <b0t> hello
[00:30:57] <b0t> help me please
[00:31:24] <tankblergh> how dramatic :)
[00:31:36] <jomofcw> Hello ! How can I detect IE using jQuery ? It seems that .browser() is deprecated.
[00:33:45] <Cork> jomofcw: you should normally NOT detect browsers
[00:33:54] <Cork> jomofcw: you should detect supported features instead
[00:34:14] <jomofcw> Hello Cork !
[00:34:17] <Cork> o/
[00:34:47] <tankblergh> hi! a friend wants to run two functions, A and B,  when he does a window resize. These must be in sequence. Is it as easy as binding the function A to the eventlistener for resize, and then inside that function calling the function B?
[00:35:01] <jomofcw> Cork in fact i've got a zoom thing that work well on each browser but not on IE :/... so, waiting for a fix, I would like to disable it when IE.
[00:35:25] <Cork> jomofcw: "zoom thing" ?
[00:35:33] <Cork> are you talking about transform?
[00:36:27] <jomofcw> Dunno :x I'm talking about Zoom Plugin from Jack : http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/
[00:36:56] <jphase> tankblergh: that depends on the function, but generally speaking, yes. If they don't fire in order you might be able to use .pipe() or .when() depending on what your application is
[00:37:45] <jomofcw> My problem with IE is that, when we create an element using jQuery, with a specifi ID, then add it/remove it on a hover event, the CSS style doesn't apply :/...
[00:37:47] <Cork> jomofcw: hmm that's just using width/height
[00:37:53] <Cork> jomofcw: why isn't that working in ie?
[00:38:03] <jomofcw> Cork ^
[00:38:35] <tankblergh> ah yes, thanks
[00:38:58] <jphase> jomofcw: Cork is saying there's no reason for that not to work in IE. Do you have some code to look at by chance?
[00:39:09] * jphase steps away into the darkness
[00:40:09] <Cork> jomofcw: so in other browsers this works on newly added elements; without calling the plugin again?
[00:40:24] <Cork> jomofcw: can't find anything in the code that would make that possible...
[00:41:03] <jomofcw> Cork yea, it's strange, really strange... would you like a test case ? I could give you access to my dev serv.
[00:41:16] <Cork> no i don't have the time for that
[00:41:27] <jomofcw> OK Cork NP.
[00:42:02] <Cork> jomofcw: anyway, i don't see anything in the code that would have to have special code for ie (at least ie7+)
[00:42:16] <Cork> but simplest way to get what you asked for would be to add the migration plugin
[00:42:18] <jomofcw> I do some test, and really it's about the "$soomTarget.insertAfter();" and "$zoomTarget.remove()" I use in my zoomIn and zoomOut method.
[00:42:27] <Cork> ?g jquery-migrate
[00:42:28] <b-ot> Cork: jquery/jquery-migrate · GitHub → https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[00:43:06] <jomofcw> Cork yup, as I explain it's not really about the jQuery zoom plugin, but more about the insertAfter/remove thing.
[00:43:19] <Cork> jomofcw: those should work just fine in ie
[00:43:30] <Cork> so no it isn't as simple as that
[00:43:38] <jomofcw> Cork so I made something wrong :/...
[00:44:02] <jomofcw> Cork imo I don't need migrate tools : I'm using jQuery 1.7.2.
[00:44:21] <Cork> browser should still exist there
[00:44:39] <jomofcw> yup, just wanna know if there was already a "better" way to do it.
[00:45:00] <jomofcw> Anyway Cork thanks for your help I will try harder to fix that strange issue.
[00:45:19] <Cork> jomofcw: well the better way is to find what breaks and fix it :)
[00:49:18] <jomofcw> Cork yeap, i get in it ^^.
[00:52:00] <thom__> im sure someone his here
[00:52:05] <thom__> okay heres my question
[00:54:30] <thom__> actually im jsfiddling a simple exmple right now
[00:54:35] <thom__> so my quesiton will be following
[00:59:05] <thom__> never mind... stupid drupal.. i dont know how to duplicate the scenario simply
[00:59:18] <_pingu> $logPre.html() returns a string like : <code>someText</code> someText contains some log text enriched by some server side added html tags, which are not interpreted as html. how can jquery interpred that tags as html?
[01:00:09] <Cork> _pingu: jquery doesn't parseHTML does
[01:00:27] <Cork> or createDocumentFragment
[01:00:49] <kepma> hi is there a way to adjust the image height by percentage
[01:01:07] <Cork> kepma: percentage of what?
[01:01:13] <Cork> parent height? image height? what?
[01:01:21] <kepma> image height
[01:01:28] <kepma> without distortion
[01:01:58] <Cork> css transform might be able to help you
[01:02:04] <Cork> other then that; no you can't
[01:02:25] <kepma> i still want it to be stretched across the page
[01:02:45] <kepma> currently I'm setting the image width to 100%
[01:02:46] <Cork> well you can set it to be x% of the parent width, and not define a height
[01:02:55] <Cork> and that will make it keep its proportions
[01:05:01] <jphase> doug65536: Cork: Anyone: if I add a custom event listener like on line 26-28 of http://hastebin.com/joxikoluge.js - am I doing this right? and also, how do I trigger it? .trigger seems to be the wrong appraoch (per doug65536's insight). Any "uh.... dont do that" would be gladly welcomed as well. Trying to figure out the best way to handle a callback.  </rant>
[01:05:04] <_pingu> Cork: ok, thanks
[01:06:04] <Cork> jphase: why would trigger be the wrong way to trigger customer events?
[01:06:19] <Cork> *custom
[01:07:26] <Cork> jphase: if you use custom events trigger is the way to trigger them; BUT the question might be if you should use custom events at all
[01:10:25] <Koopz> heh... if i submit a form it ignores invalid inputs...
[01:10:32] <Koopz> is that normal?
[01:11:04] <Cork> Koopz: invalid in what way?
[01:11:15] <jphase> Cork: well I might not've understood doug65536 earlier, he mentioned two ways of doing "callbacks", one being a true callback and one requiring the use of .trigger (perhaps in the event defintion itself?). I just want to know what a good approach would be to add an event that could be easily overridden/extended
[01:11:54] * jphase plans to do it all namespaced and everything after he can get the console to log stuffs btw
[01:11:57] <Cork> jphase: you should only use custom events if you want to expose it to third party unknown scripts
[01:12:07] <jphase> oh okay
[01:12:07] <Cork> else you should use callback systems
[01:12:23] <Cork> $.Callbacks is a fairly nice option
[01:12:33] <jphase> oh okay
[01:12:44] <jphase> for some reason I just assumed I'd want to define my own
[01:12:51] <Koopz> Cork: I've set a pattern on one field and inserted a value which doesn't match the pattern... the input gets the red border but the form gets submitted anyways...
[01:12:55] <jphase> thx 4 the tip Cork :)
[01:13:20] <thom_> http://jsfiddle.net/pLK3T/
[01:13:26] <thom_> okay i have a  question
[01:13:28] <Cork> Koopz: are you submitting through ajax?
[01:13:36] <thom_> this  is just a portion of code im writing a stripe moduloe for drupal
[01:13:38] <thom_> heres my question
[01:13:46] <thom_> e verything is working but my index.
[01:14:32] <thom_> i was going to use closure but i dont know if that would even help me... i think my real problem is tha tinstead of running each() and then the inner calback running in tandem it runs the each and then after theach runs it runs the call back
[01:14:35] <Koopz> Cork: I'm submitting via $('#formid').submit();
[01:14:41] <thom_> im really tired so it might be a bit vague
[01:15:29] <Cork> Koopz: so you are doing a normal http post?
[01:15:31] <jphase> thom_: the callback being line 6 or line 2?
[01:15:32] <thom_> but i dont know why Drupal.behaviors.stripe.stripeResponseHandler is running it loop after the each. it should run with... and the weird thing is that thers no loop in responseHanldr
[01:15:44] <jphase> ahh theres my answer h :\
[01:15:49] <jphase> hmm
[01:16:02] <jphase> thom_: can't you just put that outside your .each if you want it to fire afterwards?
[01:16:15] <thom_> in stripe.CreateToken(thing, Drupal.behaviors.stripe.str)
[01:16:17] <thom_> thing
[01:16:36] <thom_> well what i was going to do is turn the callback into an anonymouse function and add an index to the api that stripe requires
[01:16:59] <jphase> thom_: you're not using the index in that drupal function though?
[01:17:09] <thom_> but it doens't recognize it... stripe requres the 2 arguments, response, and status
[01:17:12] * jphase doesn't see index anywhere in lines 6-12
[01:17:34] <Koopz> Cork: aye... i'm just using jquery's submit-function 'cause i need to stuff before submitting the form
[01:17:35] <Cork> thom_: is any of those lines using ajax, timers or animations?
[01:17:38] <jphase> ohhh
[01:17:42] <jphase> you need the key I see
[01:17:56] <thom_> the callback function is written... with arguments (response, status, index)
[01:17:57] <Cork> Koopz: then yes it should prevent them from submitting... not sure what that isn't happening for you
[01:18:09] <thom_> but stripe doesn't let me get index so i have to come up with a new solution
[01:18:13] <thom_> and thats where my wall hits
[01:18:25] <Cork> thom_: is any of those lines using ajax, timers or animations?
[01:18:29] <thom_> nope
[01:18:33] <thom_> just straight logic
[01:18:35] <Koopz> Cork: okay... i'll try some stuff out then...
[01:19:00] <thom_> you know how callbacks can happen after.. sometimes or is that only in animations
[01:19:08] <thom_> im wondering if thats what is happening here
[01:19:23] <thom_> when i test with alert.. it runs the index outside, then the index inside
[01:19:25] <thom_> and seperate
[01:19:30] <Cork> thom_: if the function makes the code async by using a timer ot network you get that effect
[01:19:36] <Cork> (animation usually uses timers)
[01:19:44] <thom_> yeah i have run rafs before
[01:19:51] <thom_> its been a bit but i do remember
[01:20:06] <thom_> so it shouldn't be a sync problem then?
[01:20:11] <Cork> well those are the only causes that exists for you description
[01:20:24] <Cork> sync rarely gives you a problem,
[01:20:26] <thom_> this is why i dont like api's
[01:20:31] <Cork> and what you said was async not sync
[01:20:42] <jphase> "Stripe.setPublishableKey(..) identifies your website when communicating with Stripe. Note that we've pre-filled the example with your test publishable API key. Remember to replace the test key with your live key in production."  -  doesn't this API key sound like something requiring AJAX?
[01:20:53] <Cork> thom_: ya
[01:20:57] <Cork> opps
[01:20:59] <Cork> *ya
[01:21:03] <Cork> so that's the cause
[01:21:05] <thom_> what im doing actually because im writing a module for drupal... ugghhh
[01:21:23] <Cork> thom_: so you need to async loop the elements
[01:21:25] <thom_> is filling out the hidden elements in a form and using $_POST to run those to the php and iterating through them
[01:21:55] <Cork> you do that by daisy chaining the call to strip
[01:22:06] <thom_> what does daisy chain mean?
[01:22:36] <Cork> function call(index) { Stripe.createToken(..., function() { call(++index); }); }
[01:22:41] <kepma> It's not working hmmm
[01:22:42] <kepma> strange
[01:23:12] <thom_> okay... let me see if i understand what may have been the most amazing thing i never knew
[01:23:29] <thom_> did you just say i could add a second() after the first() in the function i.e
[01:23:32] <seutje> gotta love programmer lingo
[01:23:47] <thom_> stripe.createToken(){first_param,functionreference}(index);
[01:23:55] <Cork> no
[01:23:59] <thom_> bummer
[01:24:00] <thom_> okay
[01:24:07] <thom_> should i google daisychain
[01:24:20] <Cork> thom_: you replace Drupal.behaviors.stripe.stripeResponseHandler with your own function
[01:24:27] <Cork> (the inline function in my example)
[01:24:32] <thom_> well this is the problem... im having
[01:24:34] <thom_> i tried that
[01:24:39] <Cork> and then you call Drupal.behaviors.stripe.stripeResponseHandler AND your itteration function
[01:24:44] <Cork> call(++index)
[01:25:03] <Cork> thom_: the itteration function replaces your each call
[01:25:08] <thom_> first off... drupal_behaviors.stripe.stripeResponseHandler is actually i wrote
[01:25:15] <jphase> ooo, what's the preceeding ++ do?     (sorry to add on to the questions)
[01:25:16] <thom_> i havent quite figured how this works yet
[01:25:37] <jphase> increments before passing?
[01:25:38] <thom_> because it  is my function however i cant add a 3rd param such as index to accept
[01:25:51] <thom_> its undefined
[01:25:52] <Cork> var elms = $('.stripe-iterating-fields'); function call(index) { var elm = elms.eq(index); }; call(0);
[01:26:21] <thom_> holly jesus.. one sec..let me see if i can understand what you just said
[01:26:50] <thom_> i think call is a js nativ function i cant remember exactly what it does let me google that its been a bit
[01:27:05] <thom_> wait... no thats something else
[01:27:10] <seutje> not in that context
[01:27:19] <jphase> just an arbitrary function name
[01:27:51] <Cork> thom_: http://jsfiddle.net/pLK3T/1/
[01:28:13] <Cork> opps
[01:28:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pLK3T/2/
[01:28:44] <thom_> im going to give that a shot.
[01:28:53] <thom_> i had a to get a job as a sales manager and  imiss writing code
[01:29:00] <Cork> make sure you understand what happens first though
[01:29:05] <thom_>  im trying to build a business here so i can go back to what i want to do
[01:29:24] <thom_> well im not totally retarded with js/jquery im just rusty
[01:29:52] <DevAntoine> hi
[01:30:33] <DevAntoine> I've got a collection of h3 and I want to know if there's at least one h3 visible. What's the simpliest way to do it? I cant iterate over this collection but I found that overkill
[01:30:48] <thom_> i think the key here is going to be that apply .. i have to go and relearn that apply which hjave written my own jquery functions in the past... i just have to remember what this all does
[01:31:04] <Cork> DevAntoine: visible as in not hidden, or visible as in "in view"?
[01:31:07] <thom_> oooh its recursive
[01:31:09] <thom_> cool
[01:31:18] <DevAntoine> Cork: as in not hidden
[01:31:35] <Cork> $('h3:visible').length > 0
[01:31:40] <seutje> $('h3:visible').length
[01:31:43] <seutje> damnit
[01:32:05] <seutje> psh... falsy for lyfe!
[01:33:18] <thom_> okay i was right about call being a native function only in your example it was written as a user defined function
[01:33:35] <Cork> heh ya :)
[01:33:40] <Cork> well it isn't a function
[01:33:47] <Cork> it is a property on functions
[01:34:01] <jphase> Cork: I'm having a bit of a hard time understanding how I'm able to to use .Callbacks() and be able to identify each event. The docs seem to show them being added and then fired (without any reference to which event). Is it just not the best docs and I'm missing a way to target a specific callback perhaps?
[01:34:37] <Cork> jphase: so you need to identify the callback that is called?
[01:34:42] <Cork> why?
[01:34:56] <jphase> I want to have more than one event for my wysiwyg objects
[01:35:02] <Cork> ok?
[01:35:14] <Cork> why do you need to identify the callback for that?
[01:35:43] <jphase> oh, I didn't say I did, I just can't understand how to say "hey do the save event pls" quite yet
[01:35:52] * jphase doesn't know how :[
[01:36:04] <Cork> ?api Callbacks.fire
[01:36:04] <b-ot> Cork: callbacks.fire(): Call all of the callbacks with the given arguments http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.fire/
[01:36:06] <Cork> ?api Callbacks.fireWith
[01:36:09] <b-ot> Cork: callbacks.fireWith(): Call all callbacks in a list with the given context and arguments. http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.fireWith/
[01:36:33] <jphase> ahhh, fireWith ftw!
[01:36:49] <jphase> so first param is my object (with the event bound to it)?
[01:36:53] <Cork> well both can send arguments
[01:37:13] <Cork> fireWith lets you set "this"
[01:37:16] <jphase> yeah, just looked like the first one was like "add event", then "fire event", and it just fires all events for that object
[01:37:17] <jphase> in order
[01:37:24] <jphase> oh, hmm
[01:37:26] <Cork> while fire just sends arguments
[01:37:43] <jphase> so both of them just fire all the events on that object?
[01:37:48] <jphase> in order I assume?
[01:37:53] <Cork> yes
[01:38:20] <Koopz> nope... enough testing... the form doesn't get validated when i submit via jquery
[01:38:49] <thom_> illl be honest eq() seems a bit silly
[01:39:01] <thom_> and simple to code out myself but none the less....
[01:39:17] <Cork> thom_: well i added that for if you needed the current element in the itteration
[01:39:26] <jphase> Cork: okay, so in my plugin, to do something like $('div').myMethod({ save: function(){ console.log('pwnz'); });  I'd just have to figure out how to attach the event in my "var defaults" object to the elements as I build them, I get ya
[01:39:27] <thom_> right i still appreciate it
[01:40:05] <thom_> i have never used it so i looked it up
[01:40:19] <Cork> jphase: just have a Callbacks sotred and do .add on it with the save callback
[01:40:25] <thom_> im not even worreid about efficience right now
[01:40:29] <thom_>  im worreid about finishing first
[01:40:38] <thom_> im going to iterate through the versions  live
[01:40:48] <Cork> thom_: .eq is nice if you want to keep using jquery on an element
[01:41:03] <thom_> well... either way im good so thank you
[01:41:08] <thom_> its just another tool really
[01:41:10] <Cork> elms[] does almost the same thing, except it unwraps jquery from the dom element
[01:41:14] <thom_> so tanks
[01:41:18] <Cork> np
[01:41:28] <thom_> yeah... elms[] is waht i have been doing
[01:41:37] <thom_> i dont mind the spanglish version of jquery
[01:41:43] <thom_> ffor now at least
[01:41:51] <Cork> spanglish?
[01:41:55] <thom_> i usually prefer straight js but im so busy
[01:42:11] <thom_> back and forth between javascript/jquery like you might if you speak spanish and english
[01:42:16] <Cork> well jquery is nice for dom manipulation
[01:42:25] <Cork> ah
[01:42:50] <Cork> straight modern js isn't much different from jquery so :)
[01:43:01] <Cork> i find my self using the jquery lib less and less ^^
[01:44:32] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/rxjxn/1/ *sigh* y u no validate?
[01:44:52] <thom_> i have never gotten the reason for ++index vs index++ i realize the difference between the 2 but its such a subtle change
[01:46:23] <xec> thom__ the difference is the return value, the latter returns the value before increment
[01:46:36] <thom_> right i know but in code
[01:46:52] <xec> isn't that code? :P
[01:47:00] <Koopz> i remember that one time where i used that
[01:47:04] <thom_> all you have to do and what i usually do is place the variables uses before or after i have never worried about preincremint or post increment
[01:47:15] <thom_> not a big deal... it just puzzles me
[01:47:59] <xec> thom_: it only matters if you use the return value, as in array[index++] for instance
[01:48:23] <thom_> oh i guess tha tmakes sense i havent done that particular use in a while but ic ould see that  for sure
[01:48:42] <thom_> to be honest i miss pointers
[01:49:05] <thom_> i miss [whatever plus 1] puts you wherever you want to be in memory... whether its a n array or not
[01:51:00] <thom_> jesus.. i htink that may have fixed. it
[01:51:16] <thom_> the docs say that apply makes this, and argumets but it says taht arguments is a local variable
[01:51:42] <Cork> Koopz: not a super solution, but... http://jsfiddle.net/rxjxn/3/
[01:51:45] <thom_> maybe its because i have 3 kids. worked 11 hours today and its 4 am... or maybe because im stupid... why did taht work
[01:53:16] <_pingu> a='<span'; a.replace(/<span/, 'xxx') works on the console, but not in my script. it seems to have trouble with <  what could i try?
[01:53:41] <Cork> _pingu: /\<
[01:55:58] <_pingu> Cork: that does not work, too. a is a string send from the server. maybe another encoding?
[01:56:27] <Cork> _pingu: might be, js is always utf8
[01:56:51] <_pingu> Cork: the server uses java
[01:56:54] <Cork> and so should everything that communicates with it (to save you headaches)
[02:02:55] <thom_> thank you.. im exhausted.. im going to clean my house and go to sleep
[02:03:00] <thom_> gnight
[02:12:23] <Koopz> Cork: thanks for that workaround...
[02:20:53] <DRSK> How can I find out the height of an element created? Right now it seems the script isn't "aware" even though I've created the element before the check for its .height()
[02:21:31] <Cork> DRSK: you need to trigger a reflow of the element; and that means the element needs to be in the dom document
[02:21:42] <Cork> (meaning you need to append it to get the height)
[02:22:03] <DRSK> I am appending it
[02:22:25] <Cork> then .height() should work
[02:22:37] <DRSK> I am appending it to wrapper, then I'm doing wrapper.children( elem created ).height()
[02:22:53] <Cork> is the wrapper in the main document?
[02:23:00] <DRSK> it is
[02:23:08] <Cork> uh
[02:23:18] <Cork> .children( elem created ).height()??
[02:23:44] <Cork> just wrapper.append(elm); elm.height() should work
[02:36:55] <DRSK> Cork » yeah, my bad made a typo :/
[02:37:01] <DRSK> Thanks ;)
[02:43:00] <jomofcw> I need a tips please : did you used some "flip" script , i've got this one : http://blog.guilhemmarty.com/flippy/ but it doesn't work on IE 8 :/...
[02:43:59] <Cork> jomofcw: css transform only works in modern browsers
[02:44:17] <Cork> ah
[02:44:33] <Cork> jomofcw: they apparently have a fallback for ie through excanvas
[02:45:30] <jomofcw> Yup, I currently work with CSS3, but fail hard in IE 9 and earlier. So I'm looking for a JS solution ^^.
[02:45:49] <Cork> jomofcw: check the bottom of the page
[02:46:00] <Cork> ?g excanvas.js

[02:58:42] <fattest> im trying to implement this simple fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/qtRhQ/45/ in my bootstrap fiddle, however, its not working, anyone please help. my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6ChBG/1/
[02:59:35] <Cork> fattest: selected_auction isn't a valid html element
[03:00:01] <fattest> cork: thats my name of <select>
[03:00:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6ChBG/2/
[03:00:25] <fattest> cork: thank you so much
[03:00:36] <Cork> fattest: you can't select on form field names like that
[03:00:43] <Cork> and as you have an id, just use that :)
[03:00:50] <fattest> cork: thanks!
[03:14:50] <jphase> Cork: thanks for all your help, finally starting to get the hang of callbacks now :)
[03:16:40] <mobasher> i use ZeroClipboard to copy the code it is working fine but when i move the link into a table it doesn't work. why? does it have anything to do with table?
[03:23:39] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/53/ I want to click on the row and do something but nothing is happening
[03:24:04] <fat> Cork: this button checks if checkbox is checked, is there anyway to automatically check without clicking the button, like my previous fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/102/
[03:25:14] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/103/
[03:25:33] <Cork> fat: you don't need return false if you use preventDefault
[03:25:57] <fat> Cork: i meant, without the button
[03:26:08] <fat> Cork: to see if checkbox is checked automatically, without clicking on the button
[03:26:09] <Cork> fat: not sure what you mean
[03:26:15] <Cork> where?
[03:26:21] <Cork> from what?
[03:27:07] <fat> Cork: remember my previous fiddle (with the <select>?" . if you select the 2nd option, it will alert something, all you have to do is choose what to select, without clicking on the submit button
[03:27:38] <Cork> ya?
[03:27:44] <Cork> so you want a click event on the checkbox?
[03:28:15] <fat> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/104/
[03:28:22] <fat> Cork: yes
[03:28:31] <Cork> then do that
[03:28:50] <fat> Cork: with a click event?
[03:28:56] <Cork> yes
[03:29:41] <fat> Cork:  $('#fattest').change(function () { ?
[03:36:31] <fat> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/114/ is this a good way of doing it?
[03:39:37] <hxm> hi good people
[03:39:37] <Cork> eh...
[03:39:38] <Cork> no
[03:40:06] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/115/
[03:40:29] <hxm> i have a form with a text box, in the text box I added a .keyup event for send an ajax POST, it works ok, but if the queryString is too long, there are too many POST requests. How can I avoid this?
[03:40:36] <hxm> without using <return>
[03:40:41] <fat> Cork: why should i use "this"?
[03:41:05] <Cork> fat: cause this is the checkbox you clicked, why search for it again?
[03:41:38] <Cork> hxm: delay the ajax call through a timer
[03:41:48] <Cork> and reset the old timer if a keypress happens again
[03:42:00] <hxm> that sounds too expert, I go google it, thanks
[03:42:03] <Cork> and don't fire a call unless no key has been pressed for, say 2 sec
[03:42:38] <hxm> .delay
[03:42:42] <Cork> no
[03:42:44] <hxm> ok

[04:03:22] <anton____> i have an ul, i want it to be sortable and i want the li items to be draggable too, but is not working properly
[04:05:43] <lxsameer> hi is it possible to use $.ajax in another thread or worker ?
[04:06:12] <xec> it's async, why would you want to?
[04:06:49] <xec> javascript is single threaded, so no to that, but sure, you can use web workers
[04:07:07] <fat> Cork: now im trying to merge them together, i managed to echo the checkbox but it's function is not working. http://jsfiddle.net/ZZe5X/129/
[04:07:53] <Cork> fat: again you use invalid selectors
[04:08:07] <Cork> and the element doesn't exist when you run line 15
[04:08:31] <fat> cork: on line 15, it should be #fattest right?
[04:08:37] <Cork> yes
[04:08:50] <Cork> and it should be a delegated event handler
[04:09:01] <fat> Cork: what's that?
[04:09:10] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '#fattest', function() {})
[04:09:11] <fat> Cork: do i move the 2nd function of the javascript into my else if statement
[04:09:24] <Cork> as the element doesn't exist when you try to bind the event listener
[04:09:55] <Cork> fat: well you can
[04:10:00] <fat> Cork: you are such a genius, in this field
[04:10:49] <mobasher> does anyone know why zclip is not working in table?
[04:14:19] <grafi> anton____ http://jsfiddle.net/MWcDs/ whats not working?
[04:15:10] <Cork> lxsameer: yes, it should be, though you need to load a second copy of jquery
[04:15:27] <lxsameer> Cork: second copy ?
[04:15:43] <Cork> lxsameer: webworkers can't share javascript libraries
[04:16:08] <lxsameer> Cork: even if js lib loaded already ?
[04:16:10] <Cork> lxsameer: though ajax is async, so why do you need it in a separate thread?
[04:16:16] <Cork> lxsameer: yes
[04:16:30] <lxsameer> Cork: I just wondering,
[04:16:36] <lxsameer> Cork: thanks for info man
[04:16:46] <Cork> lxsameer: you could use the raw xhr object if you want
[04:16:56] <Cork> it isn't much different from $.ajax
[04:17:09] <Cork> (at least if you don't need older ie support)
[04:17:20] <Cork> or cors
[04:17:33] <lxsameer> Cork: thanks man
[04:20:34] <anton____> http://jsfiddle.net/866h5/
[04:20:48] <anton____> what i am doing wrong?
[04:24:06] <Cork> anton____: do you really need them draggable to other targets?
[04:24:16] <Cork> you can make sortable allow draggin too
[04:24:47] <anton____> yup
[04:25:00] <Cork> anton____: i don't think draggable supports connecting a sortable to it self
[04:31:27] <grafi> maybe connect lists could be helpful?

[04:55:33] <cusco> but I don't know how to get to that

[04:59:07] <PhonicUK> quick, someone stop me from using eval!
[04:59:35] <PhonicUK> http://jsfiddle.net/KcCkj/1/ << I know *why* this doesn't work, on account to the reference to 'n', but I'm not sure how to get what I want without using eval
[05:05:18] <dwarder> how do i select the first 'leaf' of <ul><li>  ?
[05:06:55] <dwarder> nevermind
[05:10:15] <DRSK> I'm grabbing a height() value, but on occasion this value is 0 because for whatever reason it fires too soon. In most cases though, it's correct. How can I make sure I don't get 0? Or, how can I make sure .height() waits until the element has its height ? :o
[05:21:04] <shoky> PhonicUK: why eval?
[05:21:29] <PhonicUK> because it's the only way I can think of doing what I'm trying to do
[05:23:30] <shoky> PhonicUK: simple fix:  http://jsfiddle.net/KcCkj/3/  or  http://jsfiddle.net/KcCkj/5/
[05:23:42] <shoky> no eval please. and no for..in on an array
[05:24:29] <grafi> i always forget that forEach even exists ...
[05:24:35] <PhonicUK> I though tthat was jquery specific
[05:24:59] <shoky> $.each is jquery
[05:25:11] <shoky> .forEach is EC5
[05:25:30] <PhonicUK> shoky, someone was asking me why I was doing it, here's the 'evil' eval version: http://jsfiddle.net/KcCkj/4/
[05:26:38] <dwarder> how do i refine selectors? i.e. var sele = $('.class1'); how do i refine sele?
[05:26:51] <shoky> PhonicUK: looks yucky ;p
[05:27:03] <dwarder> $(sele + 'li'); ?
[05:27:19] <shoky> dwarder: sele is a variable holding a jquery object, not a selector
[05:27:29] <PhonicUK> shoky, ultimately clever though, gives me all my API methods without actually writing them
[05:27:33] <shoky> dwarder: if you want to look for <li>'s inside sele:  sele.find('li')
[05:28:22] <dwarder> shoky: thank you
[05:28:25] <dwarder> got it
[05:29:48] <shoky> PhonicUK: yes, loops tend to shorten your code ;p
[05:29:56] <sammich> no way
[05:30:07] <PhonicUK> also, .forEach won't work on objects, only arrays
[05:30:20] <shoky> good thing your example had an array
[05:30:32] * sammich codes with fingers crossed
[05:30:37] * sammich finds it hard to type
[05:30:53] <PhonicUK> lol
[05:31:03] <PhonicUK> http://jsfiddle.net/KcCkj/6/ << using Function instead of Eval
[05:31:43] <shoky> same deal ;p
[05:31:56] <sammich> next protip
[05:31:58] <sammich> use console
[05:32:30] <shoky> especially now that chrome's alerts are so hideous and unnoticable
[05:33:40] <sammich> okay, what am I even looking at
[05:36:50] <sammich> okay, is window.Function() really old or...can someone find me a doc on this?
[05:37:53] <ooppa> Anyone know a slider that downloads content, scrolls through it and then updates the content ... and the thing continues?
[05:42:52] <ooppa> Anyone know a slider that downloads content, scrolls through it and then updates the content ... and the thing continues?
[05:43:08] <shoky> sammich: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function  ?
[05:43:51] <sammich> cheers
[05:44:47] <shoky> sammich: using Function like he did is considered just a slightly less evil version of eval
[05:44:49] <sammich> well, that looks a little dangerous
[05:45:06] <sammich> as in, inserting a function into code whereever you want
[05:45:29] <sammich> yeah, just slightly
[05:49:01] <ooppa> Anyone know a slider that downloads content, scrolls through it and then updates the content ... and the thing continues?
[05:50:28] <sammich> that's quite an interesting example on that MDN link
[05:50:35] <shoky> ooppa: they're called infinite scrollers or smth. don't know which one is good
[05:51:29] <ooppa> Shoky: I will check on that
[05:53:03] <ooppa> shoky: Dunno if that is what I mean
[05:54:54] <ooppa> I want thing like http://bxslider.com/ but for text and it loads things from a file AND it updates it without reloading (on the go)
[05:55:52] <shoky> ooppa: donno man. i'd just do it myself
[05:56:13] <sammich> yeah, it's pretty much just pagination
[05:56:29] <ooppa> The thing is. I'm new to this (meaning 2 days ago) and I have a project I need that on... Due day is tomorrow <.<
[05:56:31] <sammich> just load up one or two items ahead
[05:56:52] <sammich> are you new to JS?
[05:57:06] <ooppa> I know how to call function and that is about it :D
[05:58:46] <sammich> well, I suggest you get a big mug of coffee
[05:59:18] <ooppa> I have one that is 5dl. Is that big enough? :D
[05:59:44] <ooppa> I only have experience in backend stuff like DB and PHP. Frontend is a new world for me.
[06:00:45] <sammich> before you start, tell us what you need to make, in simplest terms
[06:00:57] <sammich> simpler than what you asked initially
[06:01:08] <ooppa> Alright
[06:01:19] <ooppa> What I understand is that I want:
[06:01:38] <ooppa> 1. Script loads data (for example with JSON)
[06:01:49] <ooppa> 2. It shows the content with animation
[06:02:01] <ooppa> 3. It loads the data again
[06:02:13] <ooppa> 4. It shows the content with animation
[06:02:44] <ooppa> Like with autoslide but it NEEDS to update the content without user touching it
[06:03:16] <ooppa> Primary goal is it to work, secondary to make it look smooth
[06:03:29] <ooppa> Like with this:
[06:03:34] <ooppa> http://liquidslider.com/documentation/
[06:03:58] <ooppa> but autoupdater :P if you get what I mean
[06:04:40] <sasmit87> what is the best way to add options to a select element dynamically using jquery
[06:04:49] <sasmit87> I have done like this http://pastebin.com/0V7pLvRA
[06:05:15] <ooppa> And no buttons btw :P
[06:06:17] <sammich> aside: the slow animations on that liquidslider site makes me want to punch the person who made it
[06:06:49] <sammich> (I hate animations that get in the way, so so much)
[06:06:54] <ooppa> On this page there is AJAX tutorial http://kevinbatdorf.github.io/liquidslider/examples/page2.html
[06:06:59] <ooppa> is it doable with that?
[06:07:27] <sasmit87> what is the best way to add options to a select element dynamically using jquery
[06:07:33] <sasmit87> http://pastebin.com/0V7pLvRA
[06:10:57] <sammich> ooppa: looks like you might have to do that ajax loader with dynamic tabs
[06:11:07] <sammich> or, just hide the tabs
[06:11:25] <sammich> and just trigger the next page every so often, or use the autoslide
[06:11:46] <sammich> I'm afraid I have to leave now. Had a long day
[06:11:54] <ooppa> See ya' mate
[06:14:25] <sasmit87> can anybody answer my question
[06:15:11] <cnap> Could someone take a look on this: http://jsfiddle.net/8qYxM/ I really would like to listen to a pros suggestions
[06:17:41] <sasmit87> http://pastebin.com/0V7pLvRA
[06:20:03] <shoky> sasmit87: i'd do it like this  http://pastebin.com/T0bEMQmR   but for this little snippet it doesn't matter much
[06:21:04] <sasmit87> thankx shoky\
[06:28:10] <BillCriswell> This web IRC is pretty sweet.
[06:28:17] <BillCriswell> There's like...zero interface.
[06:30:03] <ooppa> Anyone know a slider that fetches data from DB and dynamically updates it?
[06:30:23] <BillCriswell> ooppa: You want the SLIDER to do that?
[06:31:14] <ooppa> Well the slider can load a file that does that
[06:31:27] <ooppa> but yeah, I want the slider to update the content on the go.
[06:33:50] <BillCriswell> ooppa: So you want the slider to grab records from your database and just update them? Like an: update slides set foo = "bar" where id = 3?
[06:34:16] <cnap> BillCriswell: were you referring to me for the no interface ?
[06:34:38] <BillCriswell> I'm just trying to figure out the purpose of the slider ooppa. I might be misunderstanding... usually am.
[06:34:59] <BillCriswell> ooppa: I just realized a slider is not a slideshow. Dammit.
[06:35:07] <beachandbytes2> BillCriswell, what web irc are you using?
[06:35:07] <BillCriswell> cnap: No, just speaking in general.
[06:35:15] <BillCriswell> webchat.freenode.net
[06:35:26] <cnap> BillCriswell: ah ok
[06:35:30] <ooppa> Like this: It downloads slide content from DB and gets data for slides A, B C and then it shows and slides the content A throught C then it loads them again and plays the results again
[06:35:42] <ooppa> Yeah a slideshow
[06:36:27] <beachandbytes2> what server side architecture are you using?
[06:36:45] <ooppa> Who me?
[06:37:01] <ooppa> Or Bill?
[06:37:07] <beachandbytes2> you
[06:37:23] <ooppa> WAMP (aka Apache/PhP)
[06:38:27] <beachandbytes2> try jquery cycle, and just keep adding new slides / removing old ones
[06:39:17] <ooppa> Hmmm, can ya' help me more. I'm first time using jquery :P I only have experience on backend stuff
[06:39:50] <ooppa> Would it be easy to integrate it to already existing slideshow plugin?
[06:40:32] <ooppa> For example this. I really like the animation http://showcase.awkwardgroup.com/
[06:45:23] <ooppa> So, umm?
[06:48:25] <nhqe> any idea why my $(this).parent().toggleClass wouldn't be working in Firefox?
[06:48:49] <nhqe> works fine in both Chrome & IE
[06:48:53] <Cork> nhqe: what is this and it's parent?
[06:49:14] <nhqe> Cork: I have 6 divs, each need to show/hide tax details on a button click
[06:49:32] <Cork> so this is a button and the parent is a div?
[06:50:00] <nhqe> yes
[06:50:06] <Cork> should work just fine
[06:50:12] <Cork> can you reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net?
[06:51:48] <nhqe> will do, 2 mins
[07:10:36] <ooppa> If I have: showcase.children('.showcase-slide').each(function()
[07:10:46] <ooppa> Can I do
[07:10:56] <ooppa> showcase.children('.showcase-slide').load('/showcase').each(function()
[07:12:09] <Cork> ooppa: ya, but load would load in the first child
[07:12:28] <Cork> and each wouldn't wait for the load to happen
[07:12:39] <ooppa> So what I do to load the clindren fron a file?
[07:12:53] <Cork> showcase.load('')
[07:12:54] <DevAntoine> is it possible to use the search feature of jqgrid without ajax?
[07:13:05] <DevAntoine> only searching the given rows
[07:13:09] <Cork> ooppa: or you would have to use $.get and append if you want to add to the list
[07:13:11] <alaing> Anyone familiar with grunt?
[07:14:26] <ooppa> So umm
[07:14:44] <ooppa> showcase.load('/showcase').children('.showcase-slide').each(function() ????
[07:15:54] <ooppa> It breaks the code for some reason
[07:16:52] <cnap> how can I get the "this" clicked button from a div which contains all the buttons
[07:16:53] <kk_drop1> how to change this selector to not process last a element? #block-menu-menu-header-menu > ul > li > a
[07:17:15] <cnap> I mean I have a class on the div and I am binding a click event on that class... but afterwards I need to know the this child

[07:33:06] <Psybur> If a conditional statement has a false hypothesis and a false conclusion, it is vacuously true? Thats the kind of true it is right :O

[07:40:06] <neredsenvy> Can someone help me with jQuery here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ffee9cce69b40c75b414 I want to implement drag/drop/append and what I have so far works however the problem is once the element is appended to another div it also gets some css assigned to it which I do not want as it corrupts my own css styles
[07:40:14] <neredsenvy> How can I solve this ?
[07:40:46] <neredsenvy> I tried adding ui.draggable.css({position:relative, left: '', top: ''}) // However this does not work
[07:41:17] <beachandbytes2> I don't think left:'' is valid css
[07:42:18] <neredsenvy> wow I had 0px inside before I tried again and now it works
[07:42:20] <neredsenvy> wicked : )
[07:45:08] <Quest> can ajax by jquery be a POST as well as a GET ?
[07:45:21] <Quest> type: "get",
[07:45:26] <Quest> type: "pst",
[07:45:30] <Quest> type: "post",
[07:45:40] <HLopes_> think so
[07:46:16] <HLopes_> type (default: 'GET') Type: String The type of request to make ("POST" or "GET"), default is "GET". Note: Other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can also be used here, but they are not supported by all browsers.

[08:34:56] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a codepen here http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Eurod, my issue might be fixed with jQuery or css, but figured I'd ask here.. I have these various map pins (image replaced with color on example) and each pin has a hover pop up..  It seems like the pin's pop up is covering the upper pins even though they aren't visible. I tried to mess with some z-indexes... I've been at this for hours! Any help is appreciated
[08:38:23] <banisterfiend> what's the difference between setting text and html
[08:45:32] <xec> banisterfiend: doing .text("<div>") will insert &lt;div&gt;
[08:45:48] <banisterfiend> xec cool, thanks guy!
[08:46:24] <zizzl> Anyoe?
[08:46:26] <zizzl> Anyone?
[08:50:51] <grafi> looking now zizzl
[09:03:33] <SuRfDeMoN> Hi I have 2 pages, page1.html and page2.html both have a main menu popup on them, when I go to page1.html and click on a link in the main menu popup (it is a standard <a> tag) takes me to page2.html but now there is #&state=dialog on the url, clicking on the button for the main menu popup doesn't work any more
[09:04:04] <SuRfDeMoN> How do I stop it breaking the main menu popup when changing between pages in jquery mobile ?
[09:04:28] <SuRfDeMoN> sorry #&ui-state=dialog in the url
[09:08:25] <SuRfDeMoN> looking at the html on the page when it is not working it looks like it has loaded both page1.html and page2.html all on the page at once meaning now there is 2 main menu popups, how can I stop this? a user should be able to go to either page directly and have the main menu popup, surely you don't have ta have a different menu on every single page when they are all the same menu ?
[09:16:30] <ooppa> I don't know very much about js so can anyone help me fast to mod this: http://pastebin.com/azC0xbQa to load things from html file (line 145) and reload after it has finished (line 543)? Should be fairly fast :)
[09:16:50] <ooppa> All the required links etc are included inside the pastebin
[09:17:35] <ooppa> and by reloading I mean to load the items from that file and start over :)

[09:26:22] <banisterfiend> when doing ajax, why do i need both dataType: 'json' as well as contentType: "application/json" ?
[09:28:07] <shoky> banisterfiend: you don't necessarily need them. contentType is for the request content-type (what's sent to the server). dataType is the expected response type (what's sent back from the server)
[09:28:47] <banisterfiend> shoky do you do rails? which  one of those will trigger the format.json in rails?
[09:28:56] <shoky> no i don't do rails
[09:29:07] <grafi> shoky is not into trains
[09:29:21] <shoky> but only contentType is able to trigger something on the server, so that'd be the answer to your q
[09:30:17] <shoky> dataType: 'json' means that you expect to get a json response back, and you want jquery to automatically parse it for you as json and give you a parsed object in your success callback
[09:34:20] <HLopes_> shoky?
[09:34:28] <HLopes_> benfica?
[09:34:43] <shoky> excuze?
[09:35:33] <HLopes_> i know someone that goes by that name :) guess that's not you
[09:36:12] <shoky> sry ;p
[09:40:24] <Tumulte> forget it
[09:50:25] <DeltaHeavy> If I have 6 <li>'s, is there any way to know if I clicked on the 3rd one for it to return '2' ?
[09:50:32] <Tumulte> here's a real question : I've a json like data = [{"bla"},{"bli"}], I do data[0] and got {"bla"}.... how do I transform it into [{"bla"}] ?
[09:51:10] <Tumulte> DeltaHeavy: everythings start with 0 in programmation
[09:51:33] <DeltaHeavy> Tumulte: I know, but how do I return it's position in the array of elements?
[09:51:36] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: You could do like car bla = [data[0]];
[09:51:48] <BillCriswell> var bla *
[09:52:44] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: Actually, data.slice(0,1) might make more sense.
[09:52:47] <DeltaHeavy> Ah, index()
[09:52:50] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: of course !
[09:53:20] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: I vote for slice().
[09:53:39] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: thanks !
[09:53:44] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:54:09] <BillCriswell> I might make some of my own stylesheets for webchat.freenode.net
[10:01:09] <Deele> hey
[10:01:56] <Deele> have you used twitter bootstrap and encountered behaviour when calling modal with remote second time (after hiding previous modal), it just pops in console "TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'modal'"
[10:09:40] <NeoThermic> I'm having a small issue with jquery UI's tabs. I've got the tabs working A-ok, but the content in the tabs seems to escape..
[10:10:03] <NeoThermic> I've checked and double checked, and the content divs are for sure inside the <div id="tabs">
[10:12:01] <NeoThermic> I'm pondering if it's because all the content inside is float: left
[10:23:00] <NeoThermic> aha, solved
[10:23:12] <NeoThermic> you have to float: left; width: 100% the tabs div
[10:50:38] <Rinthe> so I'm trying to make a lightbox that shows the image to it's max within the confine of the window size. I have the image height/width and window height/width. Any clues how to go about this?
[10:55:11] <HLopes_> check which is bigger, image width or height
[10:55:30] <HLopes_> then set the bigger property to be = to window width or height
[10:57:22] <JLT> In what instance wuold $ be defined and jQuery not?
[10:58:22] <duckgoose> when there is no jquery included in the script and $ is being used for something else
[10:59:04] <HLopes_> if you do $ = something;
[10:59:40] <JLT> well I have Zepto included aswell. It's part of css framework unfortunately. Both jQuery and Zepto are being used.
[11:01:04] <duckgoose> JLT if jquery is properly loaded then jQuery will always be defined
[11:01:54] <duckgoose> check your console for loading errors
[11:02:16] <JLT> I think I'm able to disable Zepto and only use jQuery which probably would fix my issue.
[11:03:31] <datsupportguy> have you tried loading jQuery in no conflict or wrapping the jQ bits in a function and passing it the $?
[11:04:09] <JLT> I figured it out. Whilst it is loading zepto, it's in a ternary if that foundation tends to go by. Removing the zepto reference and just going by jquery would solve my world of problems. :D
[11:10:50] <JLT> Woot! It's all good. My fault for not understanding what was happening and what was being loaded.
[11:15:28] <bberry> Hey guys, im simply trying to convert my code into jquery.... For some reason im struggling with selecting the ID's of DOM elements. here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/QxfWM/2/
[11:17:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> bberry: what are you triying to do
[11:17:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> get the id
[11:18:51] <bberry> Rohan_Bhangui: In that example, the key from the object is the id of the dom element. i use that to set the value of the dom element
[11:19:43] <bberry> basically, the top part works and is in javascript, im trying to accomplish the same thing with jquery
[11:19:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> the value that is set is the key's value
[11:19:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> right?
[11:20:01] <bberry> wait...
[11:21:10] <bberry> also, yes
[11:21:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:21:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold up
[11:22:11] <bberry> basically, it seems that when you call a dom element using $("#elementID"), the object thats returned is very different than a document.getElementById("elementID")
[11:22:20] <slimjimflim> hi, i have the following into a watch in firebug: $(this)[0]['jQuery1381254830363'] 11
[11:22:20] <slimjimflim> but when i do: alert($(this)[0]['jQuery1381254830363']); in scratchpad, i get 'undefined'
[11:22:23] <bberry> must be like a jquery proto
[11:22:26] <slimjimflim> anybody know what i'm doing wrong?
[11:23:51] <bberry> Rohan_Bhangui: If i do  $("#"+prop2)[0].value = obj2[prop2]; it works
[11:24:04] <bberry> Rohan_Bhangui: Kinda ugly :P
[11:24:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> but atleast it works
[11:24:13] <bberry> yeah
[11:24:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> sometimes the hack is not pretty but its the best option
[11:24:35] <bberry> oh you know what
[11:24:36] <bberry> that makes sense
[11:24:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> bberry: got idea
[11:24:43] <bberry> since selectors can return multiple things
[11:24:45] <bberry> they have to have an array
[11:24:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually nvm
[11:26:36] <datsupportguy> bberry, the fiddle you linked wasn't loading jQuery
[11:26:59] <bberry> datsupportguy: Yeah, i accidentally forgot to add it
[11:28:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> bberry: got it http://jsfiddle.net/QxfWM/2/
[11:28:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually
[11:28:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/QxfWM/5/
[11:28:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> muh cleaner
[11:29:11] <bberry> yeah, forgot that i could use val that way xD thx
[11:29:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[11:29:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> its cleaner than what you did before
[11:29:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> bberry: you just starting out with jquery?
[11:30:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw datsupportguy nice catch with the jquery library not laoded
[11:30:28] <bberry> Rohan_Bhangui: Yeah. Been using for about a week and a half or so
[11:30:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[11:30:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> well good luck....in errr.....whatever you are doig
[11:30:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> *doing
[11:31:01] <bberry> haha thx :D
[11:34:24] <datsupportguy> F12 is your bestest friend. In Chrome at least XD
[11:45:20] <mobasher> has anyone used zclip for copying?
[11:46:27] <grafi> nope
[11:50:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> In a jqueryui dialog when you hover the close cross in the top right, it says "close" - can this text be changed?
[11:59:48] <Rinthe> so i made the image fit into the window. how do i make it to fit to window when the user resizes the window?
[12:02:14] <taylor_> Rinthe: call the .resize() function
[12:12:28] <patchie> hi, how can i select the secound <table> for example?
[12:12:40] <patchie> inside the body
[12:15:10] <Rinthe> taylor: call .resize() and put all the calculations through it again?
[12:16:44] <taylor_> Rinthe:  bascially yea- .resize() is called when its object is being resized
[12:17:13] <taylor_> so $(object).resize(function() {  /* code to execute */ });
[12:17:52] <Rinthe> what would the object be?
[12:17:54] <Rinthe> window?
[12:18:08] <taylor_> yea
[12:18:11] <taylor_> that's the easiest
[12:18:47] <Rinthe> i put it all through but when i resize, it doesnt resize
[12:18:50] <Rinthe> it doesnt do anything haha
[12:19:29] <Rinthe> o wait
[12:19:47] <taylor_> are you targeting window or 'window'
[12:20:02] <Rinthe> window
[12:20:04] <koneko_> patchie, $("table").get(1) most probably, but for elements that are one after another: $("tr:nth-child(2)") for example.
[12:20:40] <Quest> is this the correct way to print JSON ? because I am not seeing any alert. http://pastebin.ca/2464287 but if i type the url stated in paste. i do get the object   {"id":39,"parentBoard":null,"parentBox":null,"childBoxList":[],"taskList":[],"company":null,"boxPrivilegesList":[],"type":null,"title":"MyBoxTitle","description":null,"isFirstLevelBox":false,"userList":[]}
[12:20:53] <Rinthe> im positioning my image with absolutes and negative offsets
[12:20:58] <patchie> koneko_: well..my example is a bit more complex: http://jsfiddle.net/L7wmG/
[12:21:00] <Rinthe> would that work for this?
[12:21:16] <Rinthe> when i resize, i haev to change the styles
[12:21:18] <patchie> koneko_: if you wanna take a look..
[12:22:47] <taylor_> Rinthe: you could add/remove classes on resize, and add css classes to do different styling
[12:22:52] <koneko_> Quest, might be that the request is failing with some HTTP error, not necessarily that the JSON is not parsing correctly. Check out Requests in Chrome when you hit F12 or Firebug and see if the request works
[12:23:06] <koneko_> patchie, will do
[12:23:06] <Quest> k
[12:23:07] <patchie> it seems that div:nth-child(2) chooses the third element IF...and ONLY if the third element is a div, if there is other elements there, then it doesnt do anything.
[12:23:38] <Rinthe> well having a class isnt very good becuase the window could be any size
[12:23:41] <Rinthe> im just adding the styles inline
[12:24:12] <Less_Seen> Quest: http://jsonlint.com/
[12:24:13] <koneko_> patchie, first - why do you stack tables like this - the top menu you can fix with a list with style-type: none and display: inline-block
[12:24:15] <patchie> the peoples making the webpage didnt use class or ID...i am making a greasemonkey script..so
[12:24:18] <Quest> koneko_,  ncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o 3:89      $.ajax.success 3:89       c jquery-1.10.2.min.js:4         p.fireWith jquery-1.10.2.min.js:4    k jquery-1.10.2.min.js:6    r
[12:24:56] <patchie> koneko_: what do you mean by "stack tables like this"?
[12:26:17] <Quest> Less_Seen,  thats on my localhost
[12:26:23] <Quest> koneko_,  what might be wronge?
[12:26:57] <LessSeen> well its just a json validator it shows that your json was valid
[12:27:01] <Rinthe> would this help? https://code.google.com/p/jquery-imagefit-plugin/
[12:28:51] <aniasis> since when does return false not prevent default behavior and stop propagation
[12:29:28] <patchie> koneko_: i found out! it should be nth-of-type, and not nth-child
[12:29:28] <patchie> :D
[12:31:30] <Quest> LessSeen,  koneko_  SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character

[12:40:13] <andrew9183> anyone use flot ?
[12:40:27] <duch_kazatel> without seeing the JSON it's hard to know.
[12:41:48] <duch_kazatel> could you setup your code to work on jsfiddle?
[12:45:36] <Quest> updated paste . http://pastebin.ca/2464295
[12:48:40] <duch_kazatel> Quest is that output as a string?
[12:48:43] <duch_kazatel> or just like that?
[12:49:23] <darkfrog> when an element is within a container and is using static positioning I would expect $(...).position().left to return 0 but instead it is returning the exact same value as $(...).offset().left....can anyone explain why?
[12:49:38] <Quest> duch_away,  just the output in browser for the said url
[12:49:39] <Quest> $.ajax already return a json response object
[12:51:08] <patchie> what if i want the odd tr's starting from the 5th tr and down all the table ? --> $('table > tbody > tr:odd').attr('bgcolor','green');
[12:52:08] <darkfrog> am I misunderstanding the purpose of position()?  I would expect it would essentially just return the numeric position within the current container (similar to 'left' or 'top' but pixels instead of percentage, auto, etc.)
[12:52:11] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[12:52:23] <Bloomberg> Someone has worked with jquery menu?
[12:52:44] <patchie> my code takes all the odd <tr>'s...and i want it to start from the 5th one.. please help? :)
[12:59:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[12:59:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie:
[12:59:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you could try
[13:00:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> is pick all odd tr
[13:00:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> well actually try this
[13:00:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can try an equation
[13:00:14] <patchie> i found out i coud use tr+tr+tr+tr+tr:odd
[13:00:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[13:00:29] <patchie> could*
[13:00:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the are more elegantways of doing so
[13:00:31] <patchie> :)
[13:00:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> conside the folowing
[13:00:37] <patchie> aha? :)
[13:00:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> tr:n-thchild(EQUATION HERE)
[13:00:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[13:01:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> you could do something like
[13:01:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> tr:nth-child(2n+3)
[13:01:41] <patchie> ohh
[13:01:51] <patchie> whats 2n?
[13:04:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> its an equation
[13:04:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me create fiddle
[13:04:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill do it with divs
[13:04:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> though
[13:05:32] <jonez> why not use modulus operator?
[13:05:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[13:05:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> but thisis cleaner
[13:05:45] <jonez> lol
[13:05:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> what im doing give me a sec
[13:05:54] <jonez> one operator vs a whole equation?
[13:05:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was gonna suggest modular
[13:07:56] <rmah> well, another crappy day on the markets
[13:08:04] <rmah> woops, wrong channel... sorry
[13:09:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:13:33] <Erneston> hi
[13:13:48] <Erneston> can anyone tell me why:  alert($(window).height);  returns alot more text than window height value
[13:14:28] <Erneston> what a dick , i was missing ()
[13:19:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> jonez patchie: i triumph http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/weXpe/
[13:19:57] <patchie> *reading*
[13:21:01] <patchie> ohh..nice.. ;) with css!
[13:21:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah money
[13:22:09] <jonez> Rohan_Bhangui, that doesn't look right.. why are the first four items untouched?
[13:22:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie: if it can be done in css it can be done in jquery
[13:22:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> well patchie wants to select all odd children starting from the 5th
[13:22:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie: correct if wrong
[13:22:45] <jonez> starting from the 5th.. I didn' t know about that restriction
[13:22:58] <jonez> which is why I suggested modulus to begin with
[13:23:11] <patchie> its correct :D
[13:23:15] <patchie> thanks!
[13:23:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> modulus would have worked
[13:23:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> want me to show?
[13:24:19] <patchie> if you want, and have the time :) good to learn more
[13:25:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[13:25:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay give me asec
[13:25:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> making another fiddle
[13:26:49] <patchie> oki
[13:27:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie: its a bit confusing
[13:27:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> since the index for the .each function will start at 0
[13:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> but here
[13:27:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Ep4dJ/
[13:28:00] * patchie is reading
[13:29:34] <patchie> index%2 ? is that for each other index?
[13:30:07] <patchie> or how does that line work?
[13:31:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> so here is how it works
[13:31:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a bit tricky
[13:31:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have to understand that index starts at 0
[13:31:35] <patchie> yeah
[13:31:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> so while logically an odd number is n%2 == 1
[13:31:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[13:31:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean
[13:31:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> index%2 == 1
[13:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> since index starts at 0
[13:32:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have to do index%2 == 0
[13:32:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> everything must be -1
[13:32:34] <patchie> yeah..understand that part
[13:32:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> all the constants being compared
[13:32:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> what are you not getting
[13:32:44] <patchie> but what does index%2 do?
[13:32:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh
[13:32:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> that index mod 2
[13:33:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> the thing jonez was taling about
[13:33:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> it gets the remainder
[13:33:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> from the division
[13:33:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> so if i do 14%2
[13:33:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> it gives me 0
[13:34:02] <patchie> does it have something to do with percent?
[13:34:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> if i do 8%3 then
[13:34:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will return 2
[13:34:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[13:34:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> not at all
[13:34:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> % is mod
[13:34:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> remember mod just gets you the remainder of the division
[13:34:38] <patchie> never heard of mod..sorry...i am a bit new to jquery :P
[13:34:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> so if x%y
[13:34:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> mod is a math term if im not mistaken
[13:34:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[13:35:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> the idea is
[13:35:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> that if i have
[13:35:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> x%y that means
[13:35:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> 'i divide x by y and i return the remainder'
[13:35:42] <datsupportguy> Yup, that's it
[13:35:46] <patchie> ahh
[13:35:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> datsupportguy: its a math term right?
[13:36:01] <patchie> 2 sec..will read the code again and try to make sense
[13:36:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[13:36:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> remember index starts at 0
[13:38:59] <patchie> hmm
[13:39:34] <patchie> 10 devided by 2 = 5 ......in the code --> 10%2 = 0
[13:39:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> again remember index starts at 0
[13:40:01] <patchie> yeah..i know
[13:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> so really 10%2 == 0
[13:40:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> is 11%2 == 1
[13:40:10] <datsupportguy> it takes the remainder
[13:40:25] <aMoniker> Is it possible to bind to a 'selected' event on a specific <option> without watching the parent <select> ?
[13:40:47] <patchie> Rohan_Bhangui: look at my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Ep4dJ/1/
[13:40:58] <datsupportguy> 10 / 2 = 5 yes, so the remainder is 0, which means 10 % 2 = 0
[13:41:21] <patchie> aha..whats remainder then?
[13:41:30] <patchie> what does it mean?
[13:41:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the case of 10%2
[13:41:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> its 0
[13:42:07] <patchie> ahh
[13:42:12] <patchie> now i understand
[13:42:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[13:42:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think what was throwing you off is the fact that index starts at 0
[13:42:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> it threw even me off
[13:42:40] <patchie> 9 / 2 = 4 ....and 1 in reminder?
[13:42:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[13:42:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[13:43:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would highy recommed to use the css version
[13:43:16] <patchie> ahh, thats advanced! :P
[13:43:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will be alot better
[13:43:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> need help with the css?
[13:43:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> one
[13:43:37] <patchie> nope..thats ok :) thanks alot !
[13:43:41] <patchie> you have helped alot! :)
[13:43:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:43:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[13:44:21] <datsupportguy> You talking an nth-child or nth-of-type? It's super nice, but not supported in all browsers :p
[13:44:50] <patchie> not? what browsers doesnt it work in? lol
[13:46:00] <datsupportguy> IE8 and earlier for both I believe.
[13:46:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> who cares lol :P
[13:46:15] <codechewing> http://caniuse.com/#search=nth-child
[13:46:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> datsupportguy: i gave patchie this also http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/weXpe/
[13:46:32] <grafi> obviously you cant do cool stuff with ie8
[13:46:34] <grafi> :p
[13:46:37] <grafi> like always
[13:46:50] <codechewing> yeah, no surprise there!
[13:46:51] <datsupportguy> mehhhhh, transitions actually degrade gracefully :p
[13:46:58] <patchie> isnt ie11 out soon ? :P heheh
[13:47:27] <Rinthe> when i click the horizontal images, they're all centered in chrome, but not in firefox, why? also nothing shows up in IE.. http://ericpaints.it
[13:49:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie: demo is already out i am using it
[13:49:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> devloper tools have come a long way
[13:49:32] <patchie> nice
[13:49:53] <patchie> what about trixie or ie7pro? is there a alternative for greasemonkey for IE?
[13:50:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol grease monkey
[13:50:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> the quick cleaner upper for facebook and other sites that hrow junk at your screen
[13:50:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> *throw
[13:54:23] <Rinthe> anyone? in IE it seems to not be scaling back up to 1 via css. but it didnt scale it down in the first place. so not sure why. with firefox, i have no clue
[14:06:37] <Rinthe> i fixed the problem with FF
[14:06:39] <Rinthe> just the IE thing tho
[14:13:02] <Rinthe> $('.lightbox img').width returns 0 in IE but correct value in FF and chrome, why is that?
[14:14:25] <duch_kazatel> Rinthe what's the CSS display property set to?
[14:15:03] <Rinthe> atm opacity, but it was in transform
[14:15:15] <Rinthe> wait
[14:15:21] <Rinthe> its display:none
[14:15:26] <Rinthe> it is hidden.
[14:15:42] <duch_kazatel> check the outerWidth property in IE via JS.
[14:15:48] <duch_kazatel> iirc, IE reports whatever you see.
[14:16:07] <Rinthe> what outerWidth?
[14:16:26] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10852880/jquery-width-not-working-in-ie
[14:22:40] <Rinthe> duch_kazatel: $('.lightbox img).outerWidth(false) returns 0 on all browsers
[14:50:11] <zozeer> hello, I am having some trouble with callbacks.  I have some functions that start async processes and run fine independently.  But I need to have one finish before the others start.  Sounds simple but I am a little lost as to how to write my own callback.  I have read some articles but I am still unclear on how to add one.
[14:50:57] <ingof> try to use ajaxStart & ajaxStop methods
[14:51:26] <ingof> zozeer: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ & http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/
[14:53:19] <ingof> zozeer: if you want do define a callback you just have to build a evt.listener something like $(document).trigger('evt1') ... ... then outside you can listen for that evt. like $(document).on('evt1', function(){ dosomething here})
[14:58:55] <zozeer> That last one is more what I was looking to do...  I don't understand how I would use the start/stop.  The setup I have now is: function1(args) function2(args2) function2(args3).  but function2 is dependent on function1 completing.
[15:02:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> patchie: still there?
[15:03:30] <ingof> zozeer: so you have to trigger the event in function1 and listen for that event before fire function2
[15:04:14] <ingof> zozeer: $(document).on('eventName', function2);
[15:06:38] <zozeer> So with function1 I use ajaxStop to set eventName?  These look like global things, I was looking to have more contextual chains.
[15:07:54] <ingof> no forget ajaxStart & ajaxStop
[15:08:19] <ingof> can you provide a gist ?
[15:08:41] <ingof> or something like jsbin
[15:08:47] <zozeer> yeah, standby.
[15:13:01] <zozeer> http://pastebin.com/sn72Jp17
[15:15:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: looking good...except it might benefit if you let youtube host the trailers for the time being....it will be faster
[15:33:00] <initself> i have a .datepicker that runs at the start of the page, but I'm wondering if I have to explictly call it again if I add a class that uses it?
[15:33:03] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/ae8WW/
[15:33:32] <initself> I am adding the class by way of .change()
[15:35:35] <ingof> zozeer: i dont think you can do this within the onsubmit attribute of the form
[15:36:33] <StanAccy> Im trying to display a popup div just below the link/button that triggered it to be shown.  My problem now is that for buttons over on the far right side of the page, the popup is displayed too far right, and I need to shift it back a little. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/UDuyG/38/
[15:37:20] <StanAccy> so the default should be immediately below and left edge aligned, except if the position on screen would cause it to be off screen.  What variables can I check to get the screen edge?
[15:37:32] <ingof> zozeer: you have to extract the script from the form - i think you've done this because you need the data where the form submits to. but i think its more effective to write those in a data-attr and read that from you js file so you can handle things
[15:43:58] <ingof> StanAccy: did you try to use offset().left ?
[15:45:37] <zozeer> ingof, I think I see what you are getting at.  I will give it a shot.
[15:45:38] <ingof> StanAccy: in addition with $(document).width() you can calcutate if the popup is too large
[15:55:03] <Rinthe> is there a way to unset an attr. using .attr?
[15:57:52] <pixelpimp> ?api removeAttr
[15:57:52] <b-ot> pixelpimp: .removeAttr(): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[16:09:00] <Rinthe> pixelpimp: thx
[16:15:29] <initself> for those of you playing at home, i fixed my problem by calling .datepicker directly
[16:15:32] <initself> initself++
[16:22:42] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content There's an example here that seems to suggest I can do content: url(foo.html); but I'm having any luck... Is this just bad documentation or am I overlooking something?
[16:25:17] <pixelpimp> kind of misleading.  i can't think of an application for that
[16:54:34] <defaultro> hey guys, boss is telling me to automatically update img src links after the page has been fully loaded so that it points to a different source/server. It's for domain sharding. I'm thinking that this is not a good idea because browser is going to do more work especially if there are many images. It's going to make it slower too, I guess.
[16:55:55] <defaultro> what are your thoughts?
[16:56:23] <jedimind> theoretically its faster, but it shouldnt be done on the js layer necessarily
[16:56:48] <jedimind> you should be implementing a real content distribution network solution if its something that is a neccessity
[16:56:50] <jedimind> -c
[17:00:09] <duch_kazatel> defaultro use a CDN.
[17:00:37] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what they're for.
[17:00:42] <defaultro> i am plannign to use mod_pagespeed which does caching as well as domain sharding
[17:01:19] <defaultro> I mentioned CDN and boss said it's expensive. I was shocked. I just kept quiet and didn't debate.
[17:01:41] <duch_kazatel> you need to do this via some other mechanism, either way.
[17:01:44] <duch_kazatel> in page is a bad idea.
[17:01:55] <defaultro> page is a bad idea?
[17:02:09] <duch_kazatel> replacing it in page using javascript is, yeah.
[17:02:12] <defaultro> i'm referring to mod_pagespeed which is installed in apache
[17:02:30] <duch_kazatel> as long as you don't do it with javascript ;)
[17:02:34] <defaultro> yeah, replacing the values in javascript layer is bad. Is that what yo umean?
[17:02:37] <defaultro> got it
[17:02:44] <defaultro> we are on the same page then
[17:02:57] <defaultro> my boss and other devs might ask me, why is it bad. What should I tell?
[17:03:13] <defaultro> i will really push mod_pagespeed as it really rocks!
[17:03:16] <defaultro> I've seen how it works
[17:04:12] <duch_kazatel> why are you sharding the domain?
[17:04:31] <duch_kazatel> and how are you determining the proper URL after pageload?
[17:04:48] <duch_kazatel> images will probably load before you swap out the source URL anyway, soooo..
[17:05:31] <defaultro> pagespeed takes care of the sharding
[17:05:43] <defaultro> pagespeed does it before it gets sent to the client
[17:06:44] <defaultro> my recommendation is sharding the img src, js, css on the apache/pagespeed level rather than doing the sharding on the application level.
[17:07:35] <duch_kazatel> my point is you'd ask THEM how you would determine the "correct" url after pageload.
[17:07:43] <duch_kazatel> the entire point is to say "why not do it server side?"
[17:08:12] <defaultro> exactly, that's what I was mentioning too. I'll have to really convice my boss that server side is the way to go
[17:08:35] <defaultro> there is a code i found in stackoverflow how it actually updates the link on img src
[17:08:37] <defaultro> let me find it
[17:08:46] <duch_kazatel> that's a trivial task.
[17:09:09] <duch_kazatel> the next question is how you'd tell the javascript which server to point to.
[17:09:31] <defaultro> you can see that here, http://www.phpied.com/simple-sharding-logic/
[17:09:42] <defaultro> i've tried it and it actually changes the link
[17:09:47] <defaultro> but I'm still worried about it
[17:10:19] <defaultro> like what you said, the image might have already displayed then our js file kicks in and modifies the link. I don't know what will happen
[17:10:33] <defaultro> maybe it will redownload it
[17:10:34] <duch_kazatel> you're relying on client-side javascript to determine what server to point to.
[17:10:42] <duch_kazatel> client-side won't have context of load, etc.
[17:10:45] <duch_kazatel> you basically have no control.
[17:10:54] <duch_kazatel> actual sharding gives you that control.
[17:11:01] <defaultro> yes
[17:11:10] <defaultro> and what they want is to do sharding on the client side
[17:11:17] <defaultro> similar to what that link I gave you does
[17:11:25] <defaultro> but I am not sure if it's guaranteed
[17:11:53] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'm telling you - you won't get the sort of results you're really lookingfor.
[17:12:01] <defaultro> k
[17:12:01] <duch_kazatel> the entire point of sharding is to speed up the page.
[17:12:08] <defaultro> yup
[17:12:11] <defaultro> i agree
[17:12:16] <duch_kazatel> putting javascript between the user and the image loads is going to detract from that a bit.
[17:12:24] <defaultro> k
[17:12:52] <defaultro> i have a working PoC of my pagespeed on my local machine. It's working great
[17:13:00] <duch_kazatel> that's the point.
[17:13:16] <defaultro> now, I guess to convince my boss, i will have to write some code on how he wants it and prove to him that it is slow
[17:14:05] <duch_kazatel> i would't even do that.
[17:14:10] <defaultro> ok
[17:14:15] <duch_kazatel> also: users without javascript.
[17:14:25] <duch_kazatel> search engine crawlers.
[17:14:30] <duch_kazatel> etc
[17:14:33] <defaultro> they have an answer for me when I mentioned no javscript
[17:14:43] <defaultro> what about search engine crawlers?
[17:14:45] <defaultro> i'm interested
[17:14:59] <duch_kazatel> they'll grab the original URL, not the "sharded" version
[17:15:12] <defaultro> ok
[17:15:26] <defaultro> if I am doing the sharding on the server side, will it affect engine crawlers?
[17:16:01] <defaultro> mod pagespeed rewrite the img src to use sharded domains before it gets sent to the user
[17:20:11] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[17:20:32] <defaultro> k
[17:31:17] <Decalmo> heeeellllo #jQuery
[17:32:04] <Decalmo> might anyone be able to gander over a dozen lines of code for me..?
[17:43:47] <Decalmo> how would I modify this script to only apply to the .closest form that is submitted? http://paste.laravel.com/XrX
[17:52:55] <Decalmo> no souls in here this afternoon?
[17:53:01] <Decalmo> "present" souls, I should say

[17:53:46] <Decalmo> you popped in just in time!
[17:53:53] <Decalmo> for me to harass you

[17:54:03] <jphase> hey Decalmo, lol, what's up?
[17:54:07] <Decalmo> hahah thanks man
[17:54:30] <Decalmo> was wondering if you knew how to properly adjust this script to function only on the .closest form element... http://paste.laravel.com/XrX
[17:54:40] <royalty> hello
[17:54:45] <Decalmo> hello
[17:55:30] <Decalmo> presently it serializes ALL of the forms on the page... I'd like for it to only serialize the form that is being submitted
[17:55:54] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/dXGaA/3/ I want it so that when I hover over the child items in the menu the "Fish" item has a clear background what am I doing wrong
[17:55:55] <jphase> Decalmo: you should do something like    var container = $(this);   (before your .post) and then inside your .post do something like:    $(this).closest('#contactFrame').html(data);
[17:56:03] <jphase> bah sorry
[17:56:09] <jphase> container.closest
[17:57:11] <Decalmo> alllrighty I think I gotcha
[17:57:13] <Decalmo> lemme make it happen
[17:57:15] <Decalmo> thanks again bro
[17:57:20] <jphase> np
[17:58:14] <jphase> royalty: hmm, try changing your top css declaration to something like: #navmenu > li:hover > ul
[17:59:08] <jphase> probably not exactly what you're looking for but it's a start
[18:00:01] <royalty> interesting
[18:00:19] <royalty> but lets say I wanted the li in the top menu to have the same hover functionality as the bottom menu
[18:00:43] <royalty> but I just didn't want the top menu li to show as hovered when an inner menu li was hovered
[18:01:23] <royalty> because I have a case where the menus are built stupidly
[18:02:22] <royalty> jphase, do you see what I mean?
[18:03:01] <barryhjames> Right now, when you click on a photo or link, it takes you to the top of the page and displays the bio. I want it to actually scroll up the page instead of just jump to the top. Any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/4tP5x/
[18:04:31] <jphase> royalty: hmm, yeah sort of... like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/dXGaA/5/
[18:05:12] <royalty> jphase, no I want the blue hover state to apply to top elements as well
[18:05:36] <royalty> barryhjames, did you try taking the href out? the # might be doing that?
[18:06:29] <royalty> timnovinger, hello
[18:07:46] <barryhjames> royalty: Like so? (See "Natalie Wachen" near bottom of page)? http://jsfiddle.net/4tP5x/
[18:08:20] <jphase> royalty: I'm a bit confused, so do you want the background on the top level li or no?
[18:08:49] <royalty> jphase: I do the whole point is I want it on the top level li but not when you hover over the child ul li parts
[18:08:59] <jphase> oic
[18:09:16] <royalty> barryhjames, nah there is still a a href="#" on her
[18:10:00] <barryhjames> royalty: So I need to take out the <a> all together or just the (href="#top")?
[18:10:46] <royalty> barryhjames, I am guessing the href attribute is messing with ur animation thing or could be, remove the href attribute from a elements?
[18:11:53] <barryhjames> royalty: Done. Throwing me an error now. Maybe I should change the jQuery to be when the ing is clicked instead? Or the whole list item? http://jsfiddle.net/4tP5x/
[18:12:12] <barryhjames> Again, see "Natalit Wachen."
[18:12:17] <barryhjames> Whoops! Natalie.
[18:12:37] <L8D> How do I do an HTTP POST request with a body?
[18:13:09] <royalty> barryhjames, there is still an href attribute...
[18:13:44] <barryhjames> royalty: http://jsfiddle.net/4tP5x/2/
[18:13:51] <royalty> barryhjames, just try <a> Natalie whatever </a>
[18:14:03] <barryhjames> royalty: See link above.
[18:14:29] <barryhjames> royalty: It takes me to the top (sort of), but definitely no scrolling action happening.
[18:14:30] <royalty> barryhjames, okay now JS is doing all that
[18:14:41] <royalty> barryhjames, go from there lol
[18:19:27] <jphase> royalty: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/dXGaA/7/ ?
[18:19:54] <royalty> jphase: no other way around
[18:19:57] <jphase> oic
[18:19:58] <royalty> jphase: well
[18:20:17] <royalty> jphase: not exactly I still want fish and only fish to be blue when you hover over it
[18:20:30] <royalty> jphase: and I want hal and jim to be blue when you hover over them
[18:20:44] <royalty> jphase: however when you hover over hal or jim I don't want fish to be blue
[18:21:49] <jphase> royalty: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/dXGaA/8/ ?
[18:22:18] <royalty> jphase: fish is blue when you hover over hal or jim so no
[18:22:21] <jphase> oh you DONT want fish to be blue
[18:22:22] <jphase> hmm
[18:22:26] <royalty> yeah
[18:22:53] <jphase> yeah, might need jQuery for this, but I'm trying to do it with just css
[18:23:40] <duch_kazatel> so you want whatever you're currently hovering over to be blue.
[18:26:59] <epichero> Yeah css is fine then
[18:27:21] <jphase> royalty: I couldn't find a way to do only css with :not or anything :\  so here's a jQuery hack for it: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/dXGaA/9/
[18:27:41] <jphase> bah, ruined the fish, nvm
[18:28:44] <epichero> Whats the original and the goal?
[18:28:50] <royalty> jphase, lol nt
[18:28:54] <fourcolors> blah
[18:28:55] <martisj> is there a way to see which event listeners have been attached to an element?
[18:29:20] <pixelpimp> with code or in the browser?
[18:29:24] <royalty> epichero, basically whatever I hover over make it blue but if I hover over a child I don't want anything else to be blue
[18:29:55] <jphase> martisj: try $(this).data('events')
[18:30:10] <martisj> jphase: thanks. I'll try that
[18:30:28] <martisj> Trying to figure out what happens with this ajax request, it gets called twice :S
[18:30:31] <epichero> Are you attaching the css to a class rather than id?
[18:31:23] <royalty> epichero: the og was just something like this http://jsfiddle.net/dXGaA/10/
[18:31:31] <martisj> epichero: yes
[18:31:45] <martisj> it's for autocompletion
[18:32:28] <martisj> and I believe we are using the jquery ui implementation from 1.8.22
[18:32:30] <martisj> terrible
[18:32:47] <martisj> we're attaching to $('.search-sgroup-user-<?=$position?>').on('focus.autocomplete', function(){
[18:32:54] <epichero> Add special classes instead of element children
[18:32:59] <martisj> where $position is sidebar or some other thing
[18:33:04] <martisj> epichero: me?
[18:33:13] <epichero> No royalty
[18:33:39] <royalty> epichero: yeah I don't ahve much control over mark up
[18:33:49] <royalty> epichero, so I simulated it
[18:34:17] <epichero> Hmm
[18:35:40] <jphase> royalty: you can do something similar to this, but it looks like there's some styling conflicts:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/dXGaA/11/
[18:36:34] <jphase> royalty: and honestly, what you're doing isn't conducive to use unordered lists or any nested element for that matter. If you can use another set of markup that'd be ideal
[18:36:34] <royalty> jphase, ah pretty cool
[18:36:57] <jphase> royalty: in which case you could use css completely
[18:37:03] <royalty> jphase, I know it wasn't my decision though, if it was I would have pushed back on the person who made these changes
[18:37:15] <royalty> jphase, or on whoever decided
[18:37:25] <jphase> royalty: yeah, i understand, you don't always have the liberty to change the markup
[18:37:40] <royalty> jphase, thanks man ;)
[18:37:56] <jphase> royalty: np, still buggy but I hope you can at least use it somehow :\
[18:38:12] <jphase> from hal to fish is ghetto looking hehe
[18:38:28] <jphase> but that could be fixed by display block on the fish or something :\
[18:46:03] <epichero> There are so many ways to do it , but the less control you have the more jquery is a proper solution
[18:46:05] <royalty> jphase, http://jsfiddle.net/dXGaA/20/ :) this is what I wanted in the real example it will look better bc the real example is styled differently
[18:46:30] <jphase> oic
[18:46:55] <jphase> that's less buggy than remove all blue classes too
[18:47:20] <jphase> I think in between child/parent it triggered the hover out simultaneously or something :\
[18:47:51] * jphase agrees with epichero
[18:48:39] <epichero> Because of how css matches, you could use first of type
[18:49:05] <epichero> I forget its name  lol thats how much i have used it
[18:49:09] <axscode> hi guys i have this $('.form_button').live('click', function() { var this_form = $(this).closest('form');  this_form.post(); })   <-- it says this_form has no method 'post'  any tips on this guys?
[18:51:08] <fourcolors> :0
[18:52:26] <goddard> how can i customize my buttons click shadow?
[18:52:45] <jphase> axscode: .submit() - also, don't use .live('click' anymore, use .on('click'
[18:53:07] <pixelpimp> depends how the shadow is drawn.  probably CSS.
[18:53:24] <goddard> pixelpimp: i can't seem to find the class
[18:53:43] <goddard> pixelpimp: ive inspected it and disabled every property but still shows the shadow
[18:53:46] <epichero> Use chromes debugger or firebug
[18:53:53] <axscode> ill try, on
[18:54:00] <pixelpimp> it's probably an :active pseudoclass
[18:55:04] <axscode> jphase: has no method on, this is form is generated dynamically hence i used live.
[18:55:48] <jphase> axscode: sorry, I assumed you were up to date on jQuery
[18:55:55] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[18:56:02] <epichero> Live is deprecated
[18:56:03] <jphase> documentation says to use .on ;)
[18:56:17] <jphase> axscode is on jQuery < 1.7 then
[18:56:18] <goddard> yeah its hard to catch the class when the button is pressed because it goes away
[18:56:24] <jphase> axscode: all good, either way, use .submit instead
[18:57:16] <axscode> jphase: $('form').submit()
[18:57:20] <axscode> ?
[18:57:31] <jphase> axscode: yeah, just replace your .post with .submit
[18:57:33] <axscode> i need .post() i need ajax result..
[18:57:39] <jphase> oh
[18:57:48] <axscode> does .submit() does ajax result.. sorry about it
[18:58:05] <axscode> yeah i need th data response.
[18:58:08] <jphase> axscode: no that will submit the form without ajax
[18:58:18] <jphase> axscode: well then you should setup a .post() function (without a selector in front)
[18:58:24] <jphase> ?api .post
[18:58:24] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[18:58:26] <jphase> doh!
[18:58:32] <jphase> ?api .post()
[18:58:32] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[18:58:42] <axscode> .post without a selector in front.. hmmm what will happen to that?
[18:58:56] <axscode> it will post any available form?
[18:58:58] * jphase gives up ... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[18:59:10] <jphase> that was meant for the bot, not you btw axscode heh
[18:59:29] <jphase> axscode: look at the second example on the api docs link I gave you
[18:59:40] <axscode> jphase: will that post any form exist in the page?
[18:59:46] <jphase> axscode: no
[18:59:51] <axscode> hmmm
[19:00:03] <jphase> axscode: how about you describe what you are trying to accomplish?
[19:01:02] <axscode> i have a generated form, then i have to submit with ajax result.  i think thats it so .post will only post what data params right..
[19:01:04] <axscode> hmm that make sense
[19:03:06] <jphase> axscode: yeah I think, let me give you something I wrote to use for things like this...
[19:03:35] <goddard> i think it is ui-shadow
[19:03:42] <goddard> but i can't find that on button down
[19:03:55] <k_sze[work]> Can a deferred object be aborted?
[19:04:06] <Zy> is something wrong with the jquery-ui theme page and download page?
[19:05:23] <Zy> it was working a few hours ago, but doesn't seem to be working now
[19:07:35] <goddard> i added the attribute data-shadow="false" but it still shows it on button down
[19:07:41] <Zy> anyone here?
[19:07:58] <jphase> axscode: so a method like this can be used to take regular forms and override their submit event to make them AJAXified http://hastebin.com/ceyivukiyi.coffee
[19:08:15] <axscode> Thanks jphase taking a look
[19:08:55] <jphase> axscode: you'll probably have to modify that to suit your needs, and it may not work for what you're doing. You may need to use a .each() loop on every form and use deferred .pipe() calls for each .post() request
[19:09:14] <martisj> This is a bloody nightmare
[19:09:37] <Zy> does anyone know why jqueryui.com/themeroller isn't working?
[19:11:11] <Zy> is there a different channel for jquery-ui ?
[19:11:11] <jphase> axscode: you really should upgrade jQuery to > 1.7
[19:11:18] <jphase>  ;)
[19:11:39] <Zy> who?
[19:11:46] <axscode> ill check that im not sure whats my jquery
[19:12:32] <Zy> is anyone seeing my messages here?
[19:12:34] <jphase> Zy: no, this channel is fine, works for me :\
[19:13:17] <Zy> #?
[19:13:40] <goddard> please can anyone help?
[19:13:46] <jphase> Zy: I said this channel is fine, we talk about jQuery UI here
[19:13:58] <Zy> I've forgotten how to use IRC and don't know how to msg you  privately, Jphase
[19:14:30] <jphase> Zy: if you can, just message in here, but I do see your issue
[19:14:44] <jphase> Zy: their nginx server is timing out right now
[19:14:46] <goddard> i added the attribute data-shadow="false" but it still shows it on button down
[19:15:06] <jphase> goddard: you really need to form a question that we can gather some sort of context out of
[19:15:28] <jphase> goddard: I can't tell what any of that means besides you're trying to add an attribute that has something to do with a shadow
[19:16:03] <jphase> jqm?
[19:16:05] <goddard> jphase: its been an ongoing thing i thoought i was talking with some people but basically i dont want the ui-shadow to show up when the button is pressed
[19:16:24] <jphase> goddard: create a fiddle
[19:16:25] <goddard> it shows a background shadow on button press
[19:16:38] <Zy> jphase, is someone working on the nginx server? and will that fix the themeroller?
[19:17:11] <jphase> Zy: no, this is a timeout message so they're past their max concurrent connections or it's taking up too much RAM/CPU on that server
[19:17:43] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/rwqBS/1/
[19:17:47] <goddard> jphase: ^
[19:18:10] <jphase> goddard: oic, I think it has an :active state on it
[19:18:36] <goddard> jphase: how can i remove that?
[19:19:03] <goddard> jphase: i can overwrite it by a parent element class
[19:19:05] <goddard> if possible
[19:19:08] <jphase> goddard: sec
[19:19:24] <Zy> well, when themeroller works, it downloads not just the themed ui, but jquery as well
[19:19:49] <epichero> First line is iconshadow true
[19:19:50] <Zy> but is jquery-ui the only part that is themed? and I can use a standard download of jquery.css?
[19:20:08] <epichero> But its not formatted so im not looking very hard
[19:21:30] <jphase> goddard: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/rwqBS/2/
[19:22:17] <goddard> jphase: its still showing the blue button shadow to me
[19:23:59] <goddard> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/rwqBS/4/
[19:24:59] <jphase> goddard: then just override styles maybe?  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/rwqBS/5/
[19:25:17] <goddard> jphase: perfect!
[19:26:39] <goddard> jphase: thanks
[19:26:45] <jphase> np goddard
[19:27:34] <jphase> blasted XAMPP!!!
[19:29:32] <martisj> anybody know where i can find documentation for jquery ui autocomplete?
[19:29:55] <jphase> martisj: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[19:30:04] <jphase> martisj: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[19:30:09] <martisj> jphase: thanks
[19:30:11] <jphase> np
[19:30:27] <martisj> jphase: do you know where i can find the 1.8.22 specific version?
[19:30:38] <jphase> martisj: http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/
[19:30:56] <martisj> np found it ;)
[19:30:58] <martisj> jphase: thanks
[19:31:14] <axscode> jphase: upgraded to 1.10.x     on('click'   is not triggering
[19:31:16] <axscode> :(
[19:31:35] <jphase> axscode: oh booo, make sure you bind it as you're creating your element
[19:31:47] <martisj> axscode: are you adding html elements dynamically?
[19:31:56] <axscode> yes
[19:32:11] <martisj> if so add the on eventlistener to the parent element, and target the children as a second param to the method
[19:32:18] <jphase> yup ^
[19:32:38] <martisj> like so $('#parent_elem').on('click', '.children', function() { // do awesome });
[19:32:42] <axscode> $('this_button_is_dynammically_added').on('click', function(){ alert('Triggered') });
[19:32:49] <axscode> ahhhhhhh
[19:32:52] <axscode> demmit...
[19:32:53] <martisj> axscode: yeah that won't work
[19:32:54] <martisj> :)
[19:32:56] <axscode> yes yes
[19:33:04] <martisj> you can also attach to the body
[19:33:06] <martisj> but it's not ideal
[19:33:07] <axscode> martisj: thanks for pointing that out
[19:33:16] <martisj> axscode: no prob bob
[19:33:23] <martisj> bloody christ
[19:33:26] <martisj> this is going to kill me
[19:34:17] <Zy> is there a jquery.css? or just a jquery-ui.css?
[19:35:05] <martisj> Zy: just ui.css
[19:35:32] <Zy> thank you, martisj
[19:37:14] <martisj> Zy: np
[19:38:39] <jphase> martisj: you must be working on something frustrating... :\
[19:39:03] <martisj> jphase: i am just a bout to show you the code
[19:40:00] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/KtrBF/
[19:40:03] <martisj> just horrendous
[19:41:00] <jphase> martisj: what's the problem?
[19:41:12] <jphase> oh comments, ic
[19:42:02] <martisj> This is for adding new members to a group on out site, and obviously we don't want to add the same user to the group multiple times, so that is what i am trying to do
[19:42:13] <martisj> should i be excluding from the js side or the serve side
[19:42:22] <martisj> server side makes more sense
[19:42:23] <martisj> to me
[19:42:27] <jphase> martisj: you tried a global variable that is an array and then push and pop stuff off/on the stack?
[19:42:39] <martisj> jphase: no?
[19:42:43] <martisj> how do you mean?
[19:43:05] <beachandbytes> how much data is being retrieved for autocomplete
[19:44:22] * jphase is a bit confused on the caching piece
[19:45:16] <martisj> jphase: agreed. i'm confused as well
[19:45:23] <martisj> the caching shouldn't even cache.
[19:45:34] <martisj> it doesn't make sense to cache any of the data?!?!! the term changes all the time
[19:45:41] <martisj> it's not like you can cache what the user enters.
[19:45:47] <martisj> at least not to my knowledge
[19:45:52] <jphase> martisj: what's caching this exactly?
[19:46:08] <martisj> I don't know.. I didnt' write it.
[19:46:16] <jphase> martisj: if that's the case then hack your post location
[19:46:28] <martisj> post locatioN?
[19:47:10] <martisj> jphase: do you know what the on('focus.autocomplete'  listener is?
[19:47:32] <jphase> martisj: when the autocomplete element is focused
[19:48:04] <martisj> I can't see where the autocomplete gets initialized then ?!
[19:48:07] <martisj> that doesn't make sense to me
[19:49:05] <jphase> martisj: I know this seems excessive, but if you add a unix timestamp onto the end of your URL you post to, it confuses object caching
[19:49:07] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/QX6HA/15/
[19:49:55] <jphase> martisj: so your post can look something like:   $.post('/json/search_users/' + to_unix, { // data });
[19:50:16] <jphase> worth a shot anyhow, or even a random number on there would work
[19:50:20] <jphase> with like 7 or more digits
[19:50:43] <jphase> martisj: well scratch that, it MIGHT work... depends on what's caching that and what it chooses to server based on URL
[19:51:29] <martisj> I think i have to build it up from the beginning again
[19:51:33] <martisj> this is a clusterfuck of js
[19:51:35] <martisj> and php and html
[19:51:40] <martisj> all kinds of jazz
[19:54:11] <martisj> jphase: when you say that on('focus.autocomplete'   is a listener for when an autocomplete object has been selected, how do i know that the autocomplete widget has been initialized?
[19:54:45] <martisj> don't i have to do $('#my_autocomplete_input').autocomplete( // stuff); ?
[19:56:20] <jphase> martisj: I think you can use the create event for that maybe?  http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-create
[19:57:06] <jphase> martisj: yeah, you'll still have to call autocomplete
[19:57:27] <martisj> jphase: yeah i have to figure out where that is
[19:58:22] <jphase> martisj: it's a bit confusing cause I can't really tell what caching magic is going on or anything. hard for me to help troubleshoot :\
[19:59:07] <epichero> You can view event listeners in chromes debugger or fire ug
[19:59:27] <martisj> jphase: haha neither do i :)
[19:59:28] <martisj> failblog
[19:59:34] <martisj> epichero: how so?
[19:59:39] <martisj> -so
[19:59:59] <epichero> Inspect element and upper right hand corner
[20:00:30] <epichero> Is an event listeners expander
[20:01:28] <martisj> I don't get what the search option is meant to do ?
[20:01:34] <martisj> epichero: aha
[20:01:35] <martisj> thanks
[20:04:53] <k_sze[work]> When using Deferred objects, what are the arguments passed to the done and fail callbacks?
[20:05:04] <k_sze[work]> It's not mentioned at all in the documentation, it seems.
[20:06:10] <shoky> k_sze[work]: it's whatever the deferred was resolved or rejected with
[20:08:17] <k_sze[work]> shoky: so in the case of $.when($.ajax('/foo/'), $.ajax('/bar/')), the arguments will be the jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax('/foo/'), $.ajax('/bar/')?
[20:09:03] <shoky> k_sze[work]: no, for ajax requests you need to look at the success/error callbacks in the docs for $.ajax
[20:09:19] <shoky> they are equivalent to .done and .fail
[20:09:58] <shoky> for success it'll be the response data, for error it'll be the jqXHR and 2 other args describing the error
[20:10:27] <k_sze[work]> shoky: but there are two $.ajax in that $.when I just wrote
[20:10:45] <k_sze[work]> How can it be the response data (from just one of the $.ajax)
[20:10:48] <shoky> k_sze[work]: right. you'll get the arguments for both of them in the $.when callbacks
[20:10:50] <shoky> try it
[20:10:54] <shoky> console.log(arguments)
[20:14:52] <k_sze[work]> ah, so for each $.ajax, it will wrap, in an array, the arguments that would have been passed to the success callback of an *individual* $.ajax.
[20:15:28] <k_sze[work]> s/success/done/
[20:20:02] <Decalmo> how do you do php in your view without it being written while using blade? IE {{ $i = 1 }} it still echos out the digit
[20:20:24] <Decalmo> oops
[20:20:30] <Decalmo> wrong channel :)
[20:30:45] <MissGeek> hi guys, does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/EWaLv/
[20:31:06] <MissGeek> Trying to create a simple fader.. the navigation works.. but the auto cycling doesn't for some reason
[20:33:18] <rmah> MissGeek: works for me
[20:33:36] <MissGeek> rmah: just keeps flashing the blue page 1 for me?
[20:35:30] <rmah> MissGeek: you're not changing which item has the selected class
[20:35:50] <rmah> oh wait, never mind
[20:36:09] <MissGeek> yeah, that's only applies to the nav
[20:36:16] <MissGeek> that*
[20:38:36] <zakj> MissGeek: your code refers to ul.triggers, which doesn't exist in your markup
[20:39:48] <MissGeek> zakj: ah.. there we go :) thanks!
[20:40:34] <rmah> oh duh
[20:40:40] <rmah> haha, you never increment target
[20:47:17] <rmah> MissGeek: you still there?
[20:47:24] <obiwanjabr0ni> anyone here good with ajax? trying to figure out why I'm getting a null:  http://pastebin.com/YmKZ9NP2
[20:48:32] <MissGeek> rmah: yip
[20:48:57] <rmah> did you get it to work?
[20:50:14] <MissGeek> yip thanks
[20:50:43] <rmah> I just want to make one small point
[20:50:47] <rmah> you do this: target === lastElem ? target = 0 : target = target+1;
[20:50:51] <rmah> that's not really good form
[20:51:08] <rmah> it should be written: target = condition ? val1 : al2;
[20:51:22] <rmah> i.e. target = target === lastElem ? 0 : target + 1;
[21:31:29] <ozatomic> Hye im just tring to figure out why $('link[@data-rel*=style][@rel*=alt][title]') works but jQuery('link[@data-rel*=style][@rel*=alt][title]') throws an error
[21:31:40] <ozatomic> also having same issue with $.cookie working but not jQuery.cookie
[22:02:23] <jphase> ozatomic: hmm, very odd... can you console.log(jQuery) and get a fancy object?
[22:02:55] <ozatomic> i jsut worked around it and did it in the palce $ was working
[22:03:06] <ozatomic> had other stuff i needed to complete but thanks for responding
[22:53:31] <jop008> Why is the alert not fired when clicking on the list item? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/60/
[22:57:13] <jop008> found ul must hold the event click
[23:13:08] <jop008> I have this <ul><;i>>table><tr>>td> the onclick event fires on the td tag. How to reach to li element?
[23:13:15] <jop008> I tried with closest
[23:14:58] <jop008> soleved
[23:23:06] <jop008> <table width='100%' what is the css equivalent?
[23:23:16] <Cork> width: 100%
[23:23:39] <Cork> or just nothing, as 100% is the default for display: table;
[23:24:16] <Cork> opps, the last part isn't correct... sorry
[23:38:57] <ruckerz> Can you $("body").scroll() ?
[23:39:04] <ruckerz> i can't seem to get it to trigger
[23:40:40] <Cork> ruckerz: only if you add overflow to body
[23:40:50] <Cork> normally it is window that scrolls
[23:41:03] <ruckerz> i first put window, but then i wondered why i couldn't put body
[23:41:22] <Cork> ruckerz: cause body normally expands to the height of the content
[23:41:25] <Cork> it doens't overflow
[23:54:18] <Cork> oooh, nice
[23:54:29] <Cork> es6 is getting computed property names ^^
