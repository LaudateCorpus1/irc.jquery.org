[07:21:09] <graingert> zenox: $ is a function
[07:21:35] <graingert> zenox: $(someVar) is a function application
[07:21:51] <graingert> There's no operator involved
[08:34:05] <zenox> graingert, i actually meant ${somevar} with curly braces!
[08:34:28] <zenox> isn't it some type of evaluation for string concatanation, e.g. "foo${somevar}bar"
[08:35:04] <graingert> zenox: template strings
[08:35:11] <graingert> You need ` though
[08:44:42] <zenox> ah thanks
[08:45:19] <zenox> so i took a look at electron, and although the premise is interesting, it still has some way to go
[08:45:31] <zenox> it reminds me of a browserified adobe air
[08:45:36] <nikio_> how can i force autoplay a webm file on chrome mobile?

[09:00:18] <bluereign> After a post request, is the latest get route updated? For example, if I click a login link, go from index.html to login.html, then on login.html I use the AJAX form to login. After that AJAX post is sent, will the last referral link be index.html still or would it be login.html now?
[09:04:26] <shoky> what do you mean by "last referral link"?  ajax doesn't affect the browser url, anyways
[09:06:47] <bluereign> if I visit google.com and click images. The server will know the link I referred from, the previous page I was on. index -> login (referral is index). Store -> contact (referral is store). I am wondering if a post submission would change referral. I don't think it should. I'll just test it. JQuery and I don't seem to get along.
[09:39:47] <shoky> the referral is whatever page the request came from, doesn't matter if it's post or get, or ajax
[12:32:09] <somerandomteen> Hi all, wondered if anyone can help with a stupid problem I'm having with .click. https://gist.github.com/mashedkeyboard/a2afb54880d57556c83718ba95fabbf4 I change the class in my .click function on that class, but if the object is clicked again, the same function triggers. How do I get it to update the triggers?
[12:33:34] <Woet> somerandomteen: what did you google for so far?
[12:34:37] <somerandomteen> "reset click events on class change jquery", "dynamic click update jquery", "class change on .click event jquery"
[12:34:59] <somerandomteen> although I just saw something regarding using .on("click") instead, I'm giving that a go
[12:35:03] <Woet> somerandomteen: https://i.imgur.com/v2VvDCH.png
[12:35:11] <Woet> what am I missing here?
[12:35:51] <somerandomteen> Ecosia being a worse search engine? :P thanks haha! https://www.ecosia.org/search?addon=firefox&p=1&q=reset+onclick+events+on+class+change+jquery
[12:36:00] <Woet> well yea
[12:36:01] <Woet> its not google
[12:36:21] <Woet> anyways, just reading the .click docs gives you the answer: https://api.jquery.com/click/ - "As the .click() method is just a shorthand for .on( "click", handler ), detaching is possible using .off( "click" )."
[12:36:22] <somerandomteen> yeah, but Google doesn't plant trees in the amazon from their ad revenue so
[12:37:11] <Woet> somerandomteen: you can use google, save valuable time, earn more money because you have more time and then donate
[12:37:14] <Woet> much more effective
[12:39:53] <Woet> and their $2.5 billion investment in renewable energy aint bad either
[12:40:25] <somerandomteen> true say, but their entire income being invested in tracking you isn't too great imo
[12:41:01] <somerandomteen> but hey, "don't be evil"
[12:41:22] <Woet> im pretty sure they have other investments
[12:42:00] <somerandomteen> ...hyperbole, obviously - I assumed that went without saying
[12:42:39] <somerandomteen> my point is that their business model is to track you and sell your data, which I inherently don't like, and thus use ecosia, which doesn't have accounts, or duckduckgo
[12:42:39] <Woet> i'd rather have relevant ads than random ads
[12:42:57] <Woet> they dont sell your data, that'd be the worst idea ever for them
[12:43:02] <somerandomteen> perhaps this is a debate for another place and time, not in #jquery lol
[12:43:10] <somerandomteen> "they dont sell your data" demonstratably false
[12:43:21] <Woet> can you demonstrate?
[12:43:42] <Woet> note that allowing advertisers to target their ads is not selling any data
[12:44:39] <somerandomteen> https://www.salon.com/2014/02/05/4_ways_google_is_destroying_privacy_and_collecting_your_data_partner/
[12:44:41] <somerandomteen> but as aforementioned
[12:44:43] <somerandomteen> not the place or time
[12:45:11] <Woet> since when is collecting the same as selling?
[12:45:45] <Woet> no one is arguing that google doesn't collect vast amounts of information
[12:45:54] <Woet> and no one is arguing that they use that data to make vast amounts of money
[12:46:01] <Woet> but they dont sell it - its their most valuable resource
[17:28:57] <CaptObvious> Is there a way to get the URL (including querystring) of an in-progress AJAX request made with $.ajax?
[17:31:07] <CaptObvious> or even in the beforeRequest event?
[17:31:20] <CaptObvious> I know I can use this.url, but that only fetches the URL, it doesn't fetch the querystring
[17:31:47] <CaptObvious> beforeSend*
[19:09:06] <randymarsh9> hello
[19:09:32] <randymarsh9> what's the equivalent to keyup function on detecting a select statement?
[19:09:52] <randymarsh9> click?
[19:19:58] <randymarsh9> turns out i can use change() to detect
[19:20:15] <randymarsh9> anybody know why change only works on a class and not on a name?
[19:21:24] <randymarsh9> err ID?
