[02:58:50] <nirakara> question: when using display: none or jquery.hide(), the elements that are hidden still take up a little height each, thus pushing the button that is meant to "show" them down
[02:59:07] <nirakara> if i add !important to the display:none, then the height is in fact 0, as it should be, but now jquery.show() will not work on these elements
[02:59:12] <nirakara> what's the correct approach here?
[03:04:46] <Cork> nirakara: you most likely have css with display: <someting> !important
[03:05:08] <Cork> check in your developer tools what the actual rules affecting the element are
[11:06:19] <Zoffix> Hey. How to "unwrap" jQuery object and get plain object? E.g., if I do var el = $(this); in a click callback, how to get plain `this` back from el?
[11:07:57] <Zoffix> Hm. Looks like just doing el[0] does the trick. Is that the standard way to do that?
[11:08:03] <makr8100> Zoffix: the plain object is still 'this'
[11:08:18] <makr8100> it only becomes a JQuery object when you pass it into $()
[11:08:40] <Zoffix> makr8100: yeah, I know `this` is still `this`. How to get it from `el`
[11:08:46] <makr8100> but yes, $(this)[0] is the same as this
[11:08:53] <makr8100> var el = this;
[11:09:00] <Zoffix> Alright. Thanks.
[11:09:18] <makr8100> or as you said, el[0]
[11:09:24] <makr8100> np
[11:09:34] <Zoffix> Thanks for the help \o
[11:09:54] <makr8100> or don't stick around...  lol
[11:10:16] <makr8100> when I was new to JQuery I thought $(this) was some sort of magical different thing too :|
[11:57:20] <Lucenut> Hey guys, I have a form that is used both in the application backend, then also for public users. They have distinctly different layouts. Both have jquery, but the public layout also runs bootstrap. I have a link to open a colorbox dialog that works in the backend, but in the public layout the colorbox dialog doesn't open.
[11:57:57] <taplar> "backend" usually means server side.  Are you referring to something different?
[11:58:17] <Lucenut> Admin area of the application.
[11:58:59] <Lucenut> I have viewed the source on both layouts and clicked the scripts and they all resolve.
[11:59:11] <taplar> ok, so typical questions.  any console errors?  Have you verified that the selectors are finding the elements?
[11:59:35] <Lucenut> Hmm.
[12:00:55] <Lucenut> win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:3 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined    at win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:3
[12:01:29] <Lucenut> <a href="docs/win/win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=#attributes.event_id#&regs_id=#attributes.regs_id#" class="couponForm">Apply a Coupon</a>
[12:01:31] <taplar> so a script is trying to use jQuery before it is imported.
[12:01:34] <Lucenut> That is my link.
[12:01:40] <taplar> or jQuery is running in noConflict mode and $ is not jQuery
[12:02:30] <Lucenut> $(".couponForm").colorbox({transition:"fade", width:"75%", height:"75%"});
[12:02:58] <Lucenut> That is the js that opens the colorbox.
[12:03:08] <taplar> do this, pop open your browser console and type: console.log($, jQuery)
[12:03:11] <taplar> see what it logs
[12:03:11] <Lucenut> I see jquery in the source.
[12:03:51] <Lucenut> jQuery is not defined.
[12:04:00] <taplar> both are undefined?
[12:06:17] <Lucenut> So I just pasted in a jquery include again in the layout and did console.log($, jQuery) and the console says: win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:3 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined    at win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:3(anonymous) @ win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:3win_coupon_form.cfm?event_id=1&regs_id=1:14 GET
[12:06:18] <Lucenut> http://gie.luceconsulting.net/files/reg_assets/styles/1.css?v=0.0.1 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
[12:06:56] <taplar> uh, are you putting that log in the console or in your source code?
[12:07:09] <Lucenut> So is that saying jquery isn't running in the dialog?
[12:09:18] <Lucenut> I put a jquery script call in the source code and then ran console.log($, jQuery)
[12:09:54] <taplar> https://imgur.com/BPBDAS2  you should be seeing something log similar to that
[12:10:04] <taplar> it may just be "fn()" in other browsers
[12:10:11] <taplar> but both of them should log, and be the same thing
[12:11:00] <taplar> if the second one doesn't match the first one, then $ could be assigned to something other than jQuery
[12:11:19] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out why $ isn't working as expected?
[12:11:21] <Lucenut> Hmm, I don't follow.
[12:11:25] <taplar> if the second one is undefined, that means jQuery is either not being successfully loaded on the page, or it's not attached to the window.jQuery variable
[12:11:53] <taplar> When jQuery is included on the page, it attaches itself to the window.jQuery variable
[12:12:02] <taplar> and also the $ variable, if noConflict is used
[12:12:06] <taplar> *not used
[12:12:50] <taplar> so you said you added a jQuery include to the page/
[12:12:51] <taplar> ?
[12:12:59] <Lucenut> Yes.
[12:13:13] <taplar> so check your network console and find that file, make sure it has a success http code
[12:13:17] <Lucenut> When I click the link the console says: GET http://gie.luceconsulting.net/files/reg_assets/styles/1.css?v=0.0.1 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
[12:13:26] <Lucenut> OK
[12:14:22] <Lucenut> Not sure how to do that in the console.
[12:14:29] <Lucenut> I'm using chrome.
[12:14:35] <taplar> not the console, see all the tabs above the console?
[12:14:41] <taplar> one of those says "Network"
[12:15:04] <taplar> https://i.imgur.com/7uWHp0i.png
[12:15:32] <taplar> that's a firefox img, but chrome also has a similar'ish layout
[12:15:53] <Lucenut> In the top section I scrolled through and found this: <script type="text/javascript" src="/Common/scripts/jQuery/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
[12:16:09] <taplar> no dude, look at the network console
[12:16:10] <robertmaxrees> he wants to make sure that script tags is actually loading jquery
[12:16:15] <robertmaxrees> hence the need to check the network tab
[12:16:30] <Lucenut> OK, I found network]
[12:17:08] <taplar> so that jquery-3.1.1.min.js should be listed in there.  If not, refresh the page while the network console is open to give it a chance to get a network capture
[12:18:05] <taplar> once you find it, it should have a response code on it of like 200 or 301
[12:18:29] <taplar> if it has a 4xx or 5xx response code, you have a reference error
[12:19:44] <Lucenut> I click on the jquery 3.3.1.js in the network pane and then at the bottom in the console pane it says: Uncaught TypeError: a(...).live is not a function    at gb (VM6266 jquery.colorbox-min.1.9.js:4)    at w.fn.init.a.fn.<computed>.a.<computed> [as colorbox] (VM6266 jquery.colorbox-min.1.9.js:4)    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous>
[12:19:45] <Lucenut> (index.cfm?do=reg.details&event_id=1&regs_id=1&returnCircuit=none:325)    at l (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)    at c (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)
[12:20:12] <taplar> we're not interested in the console.  just the network tab
[12:20:19] <taplar> what response code does that file have in the network console?
[12:20:46] <Lucenut> OK: Request URL: http://gie.luceconsulting.net/Common/scripts/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.jsRequest Method: GETStatus Code: 200 OK (from memory cache)
[12:21:01] <taplar> ok, so it's loading that successfully
[12:21:47] <Lucenut> Maybe colorbox needs to be after jquery?
[12:21:59] <taplar> what?
[12:22:53] <taplar> it should be noted on that last error you gave, it's trying to use live()
[12:22:59] <taplar> live() was removed in 1.9
[12:23:03] <taplar> and you're using 3x
[12:23:38] <Lucenut> OK, I see the colorbox script is after jquery.
[12:23:44] <taplar> but for it to get to that error, it would have to know what jQuery is.  which was your original issue
[12:23:48] <Lucenut> I don't know what live() is.
[12:23:53] <taplar> so is the not finding jQuery not an issue now?
[12:24:19] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/live/  is a deprecated way of making event bindings
[12:24:45] <Lucenut> When I click the link now the console says: GET http://gie.luceconsulting.net/files/reg_assets/styles/1.css?v=0.0.1 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
[12:25:12] <Lucenut> Instead of the coupon form opening in the dialog, it just opens in the browser.
[12:25:19] <taplar> i'm not sure how trying to retrieve a css file is related to javascript?
[12:26:27] <Horacsio> hi I need to check if a span is <= 150 after typing into a textarea
[12:26:37] <taplar> but trying to scratch off issues.  is your code now in a place that it recognizes that $ is jQuery?
[12:26:47] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio less than or equal to 150 *what*?
[12:27:01] <Horacsio> characters that I type
[12:27:09] <Horacsio> https://olho.pt/call-for-entries/
[12:27:10] <robertmaxrees> .text().length <= 150
[12:27:52] <Horacsio> if ($("span.wpcf7-character-count").text().length <= 150) {
[12:27:53] <Horacsio> 				$( ".olho-cfe-proximo1" ).removeClass("hide");
[12:27:53] <Horacsio> 			}
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: sure?  linking to an entire page and expecting me to divine what part you're referencing isn't really helpful lol.
[12:28:59] <Horacsio> sorry robertmaxrees
[12:29:12] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio oh, you mean the span contains the number and you wnat to check the number inside the span?
[12:29:13] <Horacsio> You may find a textarea field
[12:29:19] <Horacsio> yes
[12:29:33] <robertmaxrees> just directly check the length of the textbox instead.
[12:29:48] <Horacsio> the textarea will decrease that span counter from the textarea
[12:29:54] <Horacsio> let me try that :D
[12:30:32] <Lucenut> OK, the 1.css call was a bad call in the win_coupon_form.cfm that is fixed.
[12:30:39] <robertmaxrees> checking the lenght of the val() of that textarea is going to be cleaner than trying to parse out that span's text.
[12:32:02] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: if ($(".olho-cfe-sinopse").text().length >= 150) {
[12:32:16] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:32:18] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[12:32:21] <Horacsio> but that won't trigger
[12:32:32] <Horacsio> this: $( ".olho-cfe-proximo1" ).removeClass("hide");
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> you need an input event listener.
[12:32:59] <taplar> Horacsio it would be helpful if you showed us more context in a jsfiddle or something.  We can't tell if you're running that in an event handler, or how it's executing
[12:34:53] <Horacsio> ok
[12:35:53] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy music
[12:36:00] <Lucenut> OK, I fixed the css error I was getting in the console when I click the link that is supposed to open the dialog. But the coupon form still just opens in the browser, not in a dialog.
[12:36:40] <taplar> so again, is the browser now recognising $ as jQuery?
[12:38:41] <Horacsio> https://jsfiddle.net/Lt7y4sqb/1/
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio so yeah, you need to bind an event listener to that textarea.
[12:39:29] <Horacsio> the counter doesnt work on that fiddle. but the idea is when the counter reaches to 150, the .olho-cfe-proximo1 shows up
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio also you're missing jquery in that fiddle.
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zaswher3/ <- including jquery.
[12:39:59] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, Horacsio start by binding an event listener to the 'input' event for the textarea.
[12:40:28] <Horacsio> ok
[12:41:19] <Lucenut> tablar, now in the console I get:
[12:41:22] <Lucenut> console.log($, jQuery)VM7355:1 ƒ (e,t){return new w.fn.init(e,t)} ƒ (e,t){return new w.fn.init(e,t)}
[12:41:41] <taplar> so it looks like it recognizes it, and they are the same
[12:41:53] <Lucenut> The same?
[12:42:11] <taplar> yep, both of those function definitions look the same, ya?
[12:42:26] <Lucenut> OK
[12:42:55] <Lucenut> But the $(".couponForm").colorbox({transition:"fade", width:"75%", height:"75%"}); still doesn't open a dialog.
[12:43:05] <taplar> ok, so you have console errors still?
[12:43:17] <Lucenut> No
[12:43:57] <taplar> And you're sture your logic is still executing?
[12:45:20] <Lucenut> OK, one missing font, and the live() error.
[12:45:38] <taplar> Which I already explained why the live error exists.
[12:45:41] <Lucenut> It seems like there's a jquery 1.9 running and the 3.3
[12:46:00] <Lucenut> Maybe I have to get rid of the 1.9?
[12:46:12] <taplar> 3x does not have live in it
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ Lucenut it pays to read what people are telling you ;)
[12:46:32] <Lucenut> We have this application script dump that must also have a 1.9 running.
[12:46:39] <taplar> it was removed in 1.9.  you would need a prior version
[12:46:49] <Lucenut> I'm reading, just not understanding. Sorry.
[12:47:12] <Lucenut> I have no idea what is calling the live() function.
[12:47:20] <taplar> some plugin file you have
[12:47:30] <Lucenut> Like colorbox maybe?
[12:47:37] <taplar> dunno, pase the live error again?
[12:47:41] <taplar> *paste
[12:48:00] <Lucenut> jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: a(...).live is not a function    at gb (VM7401 jquery.colorbox-min.1.9.js:4)    at w.fn.init.a.fn.<computed>.a.<computed> [as colorbox] (VM7401 jquery.colorbox-min.1.9.js:4)    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (index.cfm?do=reg.details&event_id=1&regs_id=1&returnCircuit=none:318)    at l (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)
[12:48:00] <Lucenut> at c (jquery-3.3.1.min.js:2)
[12:48:16] <taplar> so yeah, looks like the colorbox plugin uses live()
[12:48:22] <Lucenut> Maybe I need to get rid of the 3.3?
[12:48:28] <taplar> ...
[12:48:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:48:36] <taplar> oh, sorry
[12:48:53] <taplar> if you get rid of 3.3, you're remaining version will need to be a < 1.9 version
[12:48:55] <taplar> OR
[12:49:05] <taplar> check and see if there is an updated version of the colorbox plugin
[12:49:27] <Lucenut> OK, thanks
[12:50:34] <taplar> looks like the repo hasn't been touched in 2 years
[12:51:18] <taplar> and its source still uses live()
[12:51:25] <taplar> so you got two options
[12:51:34] <taplar> #1. downgrade jQuery to 1.8 or below
[12:51:56] <taplar> #2. edit the source code yourself to get rid of the live() calls, and any thing else broken with jQuery 3x
[12:53:41] <Horacsio> I've made the event listner with keypress but when it presses the first one it shows the button: https://jsfiddle.net/Lt7y4sqb/2/
[12:54:45] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio use the 'input' event instead.  and earlier i said you want to check the length of the value of the textarea.
[12:55:03] <Horacsio> thank you robertmaxrees
[12:55:54] <robertmaxrees> also your conditional is redundant :)
[12:56:04] <Lucenut> OK, tablar, I made a new script dump function using jquery 3.3 and the new version of colorbox. Now when I click my link that dialog fires, but it looks terrible. The rest of the page is not greyed out, and the dialog is really tiny.
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pfarL9b2/2/
[12:56:55] <robertmaxrees> Lucenut btw you keep misspelling taplar's username ;)
[12:57:26] <Lucenut> Sorry
[12:57:50] <taplar> what colorbox plugin are you using?
[12:58:27] <Lucenut> colorbox-1.6.4/jquery.colorbox-min.js
[12:58:47] <Lucenut> Not saying it's "new" but the newest in our codebase.
[12:58:47] <taplar> are you grabbing that from a particular site or github repo?
[12:59:21] <Lucenut> Someone put it in our codebase.
[12:59:34] <Lucenut> Maybe I'll try getting a newer one.
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to figure out which "colorbox" plugin you're using.
[13:00:00] <taplar> ^^^ because as I just mentioned prior, the one i found in github still uses live()
[13:00:20] <Lucenut> Hmm.
[13:00:23] <taplar> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[13:00:32] <taplar> https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox
[13:00:45] <Lucenut> So in this case I will have to use jquery 1.9 then?
[13:00:49] <taplar> https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox/blob/master/jquery.colorbox.js#L576
[13:00:52] <Lucenut> Or 1.7?
[13:00:58] <taplar> 1.8 or below
[13:01:08] <taplar> or get the source and modify it to not use live()
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> fork and un-bork
[13:02:15] <taplar> which the browser search has only one usage in it.  But that doesn't mean that's the only deprecated method it may still be using
[13:06:02] <taplar> 1,2k forks of that repo, wow
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:06:51] <Lucenut> OK, I tried a new script dump using jquery 1.7 and colorbox 1.6.4. My dialog opens, but it's not good. The rest of the page isn't greyed out and it's translucent or something.
[13:07:29] <Lucenut> I guess I'm in the ballpark now.
[13:07:44] <Lucenut> Maybe just have to figure out which versions work together.
[13:08:09] <Lucenut> Or is there a better way to make a dialog than colorbox?
[13:09:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah - grab a polyfill for the natve <dialog> element and use that.
[13:10:05] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees thank you but for some reason this doesn't work :S
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio show me your latest code.
[13:10:56] <Horacsio> https://jsfiddle.net/Lt7y4sqb/3/
[13:11:25] <robertmaxrees> are you getting thosde console logs?
[13:11:28] <robertmaxrees> *those
[13:11:30] <Horacsio> it removes the class at the first key pressed, and
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> so it's doing the reverse of what you're expecting?
[13:13:10] <Horacsio> yes, under goes untill 150, over keeps raising above 150, even when I delete characters
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> so if it's doing the reverse of what you're expecting, how do you think you'd resolve that?
[13:15:04] <Horacsio> well I've inverted the <= to >=... let me try more :D
[13:15:30] <robertmaxrees> and the button isn't hidden on pageload, right?
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> or something else is broken?
[13:16:25] <Horacsio> was a cache issue :D
[13:16:32] <robertmaxrees> cool
[13:16:33] <Horacsio> I've inverted the logic :D
[13:16:48] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees THANK YOU
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> def :)
