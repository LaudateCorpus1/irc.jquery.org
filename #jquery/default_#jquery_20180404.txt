[03:42:26] <preference> hello. i have <div class="slider set-1"><p class="para-1"><p class="para-2>... <div class="slider set-2"><p class="para-6"><p class="para-7">... and so on. is there a way for me to create these formulaic long divs in jquery so that i don't have a huge amount of simple code bloating the page?
[03:43:20] <Cork> preference: you mean there para-1, -2, -3?
[03:43:27] <preference> yeah
[03:43:37] <Cork> why do you need the number in the class name?
[03:43:58] <Cork> (it isn't how classes are meant to be used)
[03:44:12] <preference> the text that goes in those paragraphs is being taken from a table that i've made, for which i have some jquery:
[03:44:22] <preference>   $('.moveToPara').each(function(){ var $td = $(this);        $('.'+ $td.data('target')).text(this.innerHTML);         });
[03:44:26] <preference> someone helped me with this ^
[03:44:36] <Cork> ok, but why do you need the number?
[03:44:52] <preference> because the data will change very regularly and it won't be me that's changing it
[03:45:00] <preference> the end-user can only go as far as literally typing in the text they want
[03:45:18] <preference> and i don't know another way to reference each individual <p> without using a separate class
[03:45:21] <preference> i mean, i don't mind using an id instead
[03:45:25] <Cork> and $('.set:eq(3) .para:eq(4)') isn't enough?
[03:45:33] <preference> i don't know what that means
[03:45:51] <preference> i will look up eq()
[03:46:14] <Cork> <div class="set"><p class="para"></p></div><div class="set"><p class="para"></p></div><div class="set"><p class="para"></p><p class="para"></p><p class="para"></p>(<p class="para"></p>) <-- this one</div>
[03:46:29] <preference> oh, that seems great
[03:46:45] <preference> so it references the nth element of a type in the set
[03:46:53] <Cork> ya
[03:47:00] <preference> thanks a lot, will try that
[05:28:47] <VjdfMQ> Hey all
[05:30:10] <VjdfMQ> I.e. there're two files *.js and they both have document.ready(); so, in the first one there's a function and in the second it' being called, but it says undefined
[05:31:05] <Cork> VjdfMQ: firstly, javascript doesn't have files, the code is loaded when called or isn't no file relation at all
[05:31:29] <Cork> secondly, make sure you haven't defined the function inside another function, cause then it becomes local to that function and can't be seen from elsewhere
[05:31:40] <VjdfMQ> Cork: By the files I mean <script src="1.js"></script><script src="2.js"></script>
[05:31:49] <VjdfMQ> So in the second function is called from first one
[05:31:52] <Cork> ya, that is html resources
[05:31:53] <VjdfMQ> And it says undefined
[05:31:56] <Cork> it has no meaning in js
[05:32:11] <VjdfMQ> It is
[05:32:19] <Cork> what js sees is concat 1.js 2.js
[05:32:25] <VjdfMQ> I've checked if the first one is loaded at first place and it is
[05:32:48] <Cork> the point is, the separate files have nothing to do with the problem
[05:32:56] <Cork> hence why i meantioned it as a first comment
[05:33:03] <Cork> see the second comment for the most likely cause
[05:33:24] <VjdfMQ> Oh
[05:34:27] <VjdfMQ> So you mean that if document.ready( function() { fun1() .. }); so fun1 won't be called from elsewhere rather than from the same ready ?
[05:34:34] <VjdfMQ> It makes sense
[05:34:36] <Cork> yes
[05:34:53] <VjdfMQ> Btw how to make it global?
[05:35:03] <Cork> erll more $(function() { function iAmLocal() {} })
[05:35:18] <VjdfMQ> oh
[05:35:24] <Cork> either define it outside the $(func) or use it as a property
[05:35:27] <VjdfMQ> Just put function outseide ready
[05:35:39] <Cork> window.theGlobalName = function() {}
[05:35:41] <VjdfMQ> As you suggested 1 sec earlier )
[05:35:44] <VjdfMQ> oh
[05:35:50] <VjdfMQ> nice one with window
[05:35:53] <VjdfMQ> Thank you very much Cork
[05:35:53] <Cork> or window.theGlobalName = func1;
[05:36:34] <Cork> VjdfMQ: a warning though if you define it inside ready it means it isn't defined on code parsing
[05:36:47] <VjdfMQ> You mean jquery won't work there ?
[05:37:03] <Cork> VjdfMQ: so you might get random code errors if something is trying to access it before .ready has been executed completely
[05:37:15] <Cork> VjdfMQ: no, i mean it defines the function in an event
[05:37:18] <Cork> not on script load
[05:37:41] <Cork> $(func) is executed on something similar to DOMContentLoaded
[05:37:59] <Cork> and you normally want shared functions to always exist
[05:38:21] <Cork> ex $(document).on('click
[05:38:23] <Cork> opps
[05:38:41] <Cork> ex $(document).on('click', func1); after the ready would fail cause func1 isn't defined (even though it should work just fine)
[05:39:09] <Cork> so it most likely won't make a big difference, it just makes the code a little more unstable
[05:53:09] <dimi1947> how I could possible debug a change event that is not firing at all....what can I do...it is related with clicking a radio button
[05:59:52] <FilipNortic> well the usall error is that you tried  bind the handler before the element existed
[06:02:21] <dimi1947> give me a minute...I just got an idea based on what you said
[06:02:48] <FilipNortic> dimi1947:ok, I would log the output of the selector you use for the on/change binding and see if it is what you thought
[06:04:09] <dimi1947> I do not quite understood...what are you trying to say
[06:05:36] <FilipNortic> dimi1947:  if you have $("myselector").change do console.log($("myselector")); on the line above
[06:06:15] <dimi1947> FilipNortic:do you mean something like that
[06:06:18] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5a7dpa8j/15/
[06:07:40] <FilipNortic> dimi1947: no add console.log($('.price_show')); above...
[06:08:27] <dimi1947> ok...got some output in the console...what that tells me
[06:09:31] <FilipNortic> dimi1947:  or do console.log($('.price_show').length); if that is zero then there is no element to bind on
[06:09:37] <dimi1947> the main thing here is that I managed to solve the issue...you were right about the handler
[06:09:57] <dimi1947> the handler was binded before the element existed
[06:10:29] <FilipNortic> it's an easy error to make
[06:10:48] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5a7dpa8j/22/
[06:12:12] <dimi1947> the code shown in the fiddle solved it...there is a comment above it suggesting it is the one used locally
[06:29:17] <Awaad_> why the following datatable is not selectable ?
[06:29:23] <Awaad_> https://pastebin.com/29Y7ZX9W
[06:34:38] <FilipNortic> Awaad_: what happens when you try the selectors in the console?
[06:36:05] <Awaad_> FilipNortic: TypeError: $(...).dataTable.on is not a function
[06:37:05] <FilipNortic> well i bet the dataTable part shouldn't be there when adding elements
[06:37:23] <FilipNortic> eventhandlers*
[06:39:57] <Awaad_> FilipNortic: When I try the following code: https://pastebin.com/v6iWfQpv no errors coming on the console but still selection feature is not enabled
[06:41:41] <FilipNortic> on which row?
[06:41:59] <Awaad_> All rows not selectable
[06:45:11] <FilipNortic> $('#dataTables-example').dataTable(); does this work in console?
[06:45:40] <FilipNortic> otherwise it's an import issue
[06:47:08] <Awaad_> FilipNortic: Yes, it is working without errors and table is appearing
[06:53:25] <FilipNortic> Awaad_: well the last thing i can think of is that you lack something you need for the responsive option... Like an extra css or something otherwise i've got no clue
[06:55:52] <Awaad_> FilipNortic: I commented out responsive line as follows: "//"responsive": true,"
[06:56:00] <Awaad_> FilipNortic:
[06:56:13] <Awaad_> FilipNortic: Every thing is working fine except selection :(
[07:56:14] <preference> how do i check if something has no data in it?
[07:56:19] <preference> specifically a table cell
[07:57:12] <Cork> .html() == ""
[07:57:23] <Cork> note it will see child elements too
[07:57:33] <FilipNortic> unlike text()?
[07:57:41] <bRinbg> .legnth>0
[07:57:45] <Cork> same with text, except it won't see the elements
[07:57:49] <bRinbg> best for me
[07:57:57] <Cork> :empty is also an option, but it does the same as .length> 0
[07:58:01] <Cork> so it counts indents
[07:58:33] <preference> thanks
[07:59:03] <Cork> on second tought so does .html() and .text() -_-'
[07:59:16] <Cork> but there you can fairly easily exclude them
[07:59:35] <Cork> preference: also note, those are fairly heavy checks so you shouldn't run them too often
[07:59:46] <Cork> cause they will throw your page into a crawl if you do

[10:36:18] <preference> it's referencing an accordion which has three sub-sections, each denoted by an <h3>. but the accordion will not collapse and nothing i do seems to be able to make it collapsible.
[10:38:46] <preference> each <h3> has a <div> with id="variants", and i always thought that you shouldn't use the same id twice on a page for the same element type
[14:08:07] <VirusInsane> ello
[14:08:19] <VirusInsane> Is there something wrong with this? $("input[type='checkbox']").click(function(){ console.log(this.val()); });
[14:08:25] <VirusInsane> this.val is not a function
[14:11:20] <VirusInsane> bn
[14:11:22] <VirusInsane> nm
[14:11:42] <VirusInsane> console.log($(this).val()) works
[14:13:16] <VirusInsane> console.log($(this).is(":checked")) now I get true false when I click on off
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> VirusInsane that was you're expecting?
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> is that what you're expecting
[14:45:27] <VirusInsane> Yes

[14:55:40] <stuart_> I'm trying to write a selector that starts at a given element and works backwards to find all the other elements that match another selector
[14:55:49] <stuart_> https://jsfiddle.net/stuartromanek/ud9fxrsv/
[14:56:16] <stuart_> any help? or a better way I could ask for help?
[16:23:53] <ginseng> I have an input element on my page with id="id_email', and when i try in chrome console $('#id_email').val('HELLO'); it doesnt do anything on the page. But the value of the element is changed, i verify with $('#id_email').val()
[16:24:03] <ginseng> it was server rendered form element and i thought that was problem, so i removed the server rendering and now it's just a plain element on the page. Still no dice. help?
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> ginseng "server rendered form element" versus..?
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> also: are you repeating that ID perchance?
[16:24:47] <ginseng> $('#id_email').length = 1
[16:24:53] <ginseng> so no? i think
[16:24:56] <robertmaxrees> that will always return 1 :)
[16:24:57] <ginseng> and i mean
[16:25:09] <robertmaxrees> because $('#id_email') will only ever get the first one.
[16:25:12] <ginseng> it was dynamically generated vs just html file
[16:25:17] <ginseng> oh
[16:25:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id=id_email]').length);
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ try this.
[16:25:49] <ginseng> sigh
[16:25:50] <ginseng> = 2
[16:25:55] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue :)
[16:26:01] <ginseng> ty lol
[16:26:04] <ginseng> that cost brain cells

[17:08:35] <gambl0re> hows going?
[17:50:09] <LooenyToones> ohhh people are here :)
[17:50:50] <taplar> bots.  lots of bots
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> we're all bots ;)
[17:52:59] <taplar> i only know two phrases.  the previous phrase, and this phrase explaining the situation.
[17:55:42] <grapheti> https://youtu.be/mpe1R6veuBw?t=20s
[17:56:34] <taplar> ha. ha.  funny video user <grapheti>.  joke recorded.
[17:56:50] <grapheti> lmao
[18:03:08] <Sircle> robertmaxrees,   Can anyone see line 31 and 34. Why the difference? https://jsfiddle.net/cmzm70nh/
[18:04:02] <robertmaxrees> one is the return value from map.get(resourceId).get("data")
[18:04:03] <robertmaxrees>         .get(row.ticketStartDate.slice(0,10))
[18:04:04] <robertmaxrees> woops
[18:04:07] <robertmaxrees> the other is just "map
[18:05:00] <robertmaxrees> woops
[18:05:05] <robertmaxrees> Sircle see my response?
[18:05:12] <Sircle> am.. didnt got you
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> in one case you're logging the return of .get(row.ticketStartDate.slice(0,10))
[18:05:54] <Sircle> yes
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> in the other you're logging the map itself.
[18:06:02] <Sircle> yes
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> sooo that's why they're different.
[18:06:33] <Sircle> the map prints the return value of .get but the .get doesnt.
[18:06:59] <Sircle> as map has it all
[18:07:06] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:07:44] <Sircle> how come map has many results but the things inside says empty
[18:08:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see a functioning example.
[18:09:24] <Sircle> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/cmzm70nh/3/
[18:09:47] <robertmaxrees> >functioning example.  that has an error.
[18:10:15] <Sircle> works on my ide
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> doesn't in jsfiddle (shrug)
[18:10:55] <robertmaxrees> formatMe(rawJson){ isn't a valid function definition.
[18:11:16] <robertmaxrees> also can't use export in fiddles like that.
[18:11:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/cmzm70nh/8/ is this what you're meaning to do?
[18:16:58] <Sircle> robertmaxrees,  here it is https://jsfiddle.net/wvfmmu9j/
[18:17:24] <robertmaxrees> heh, I'd stick with ##javascript on this one.
[18:17:29] <robertmaxrees> since it's not really a jQuery question.
[18:18:17] <Sircle> k
[18:20:49] <LooenyToones> bots :)
[18:20:59] <LooenyToones> hrmmmm
[18:24:58] <LooenyToones> you know when you use console.log(Object.getownPropertyNames(eventObject)); how and it gives you the property names, how to access the value of propertyname?
[18:31:39] <zizzl> Hey all, looking to have an override for all $.ajax calls that changes the http type if needed, for example, changing a PUT to a POST, I've tried ajaxSend and ajaxPrefilter but neither acutally change the http type
[18:31:48] <zizzl> both of those set a header that I want to set correctly but fail to change the type when I try
[18:35:06] <robertmaxrees> could you show us the code you're using?
[18:37:09] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/g417n52b/
[18:38:38] <robertmaxrees> well.
[18:39:31] <robertmaxrees> it looks like your first problem might be the method signature for the callback.
[18:41:05] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: what do you mean
[18:41:28] <robertmaxrees> $.ajaxPrefilter(function(event, request, settings) { - those aren't the arguments that get passed to the callback
[18:42:05] <robertmaxrees> the function gets called with options, originalOptions, jqXHR
[18:42:45] <zizzl> sorry yeah naming is off, didn't change them when I switched calls
[18:42:58] <zizzl> but it's just naming at this point
[18:43:28] <robertmaxrees> that looks like more than just naming tho.
[18:43:44] <zizzl> alright I'll update it....
[18:44:19] <LooenyToones> eveing robertmaxrees
[18:44:50] <robertmaxrees> zizzl also: that's not how you set request headers :)

[18:45:08] <robertmaxrees> sup LooenyToones
[18:45:17] <LooenyToones> robert: do you kno wa way to access the "value" of a property of an object in an array?
[18:45:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:45:43] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you're trying to do?
[18:46:05] <LooenyToones> you know when you utilizing Object.getOwnPropertyNames(objectName)
[18:46:14] <LooenyToones> and it gives the key or property names right
[18:46:22] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/357/
[18:46:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:46:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[18:46:39] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:46:54] <LooenyToones> don't ask...hahahaha yes its 357, I've hit 900 before
[18:46:55] <LooenyToones> LOLOL
[18:47:02] <robertmaxrees> that's convoluted.
[18:47:47] <LooenyToones> so in the object it has 3 keys, i want to access those keys, but, the object sits in an array, so I cna't seem to get the syntax for it
[18:48:17] <LooenyToones> in the last function line: 43, indexOf => evaluates to -1
[18:48:28] <robertmaxrees> slow down a sec.
[18:48:43] <LooenyToones> sorry, adhd -> hyper max -> just woke up 10 min ago
[18:48:46] <LooenyToones> LOLOL
[18:48:49] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: seems like what I'm doing to set the header isn't wrong, see the comment below that stackoverflow post you sent
[18:48:52] <robertmaxrees> so you have an array of objects: https://jsfiddle.net/3dk9jspk/2/
[18:49:12] <robertmaxrees> zizzl show me what you have now then?
[18:49:32] <LooenyToones> the array starts with nothing and gets items push to it, but yeah
[18:49:42] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones that has nothing to do with your question ;)
[18:49:56] <robertmaxrees> you want to know how to get the value of a property of an object in an array.
[18:49:58] <LooenyToones> but sure I"m there, so I have an array of ojbects
[18:50:14] <LooenyToones> <<shuts up n' listens :)
[18:50:19] <robertmaxrees> so.
[18:50:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're trying to enumerate over the properties of an object?
[18:51:01] <robertmaxrees> and do something with the values?
[18:51:33] <LooenyToones> the functionality is for add / delete into the array itself
[18:51:48] <LooenyToones> for comparison and evaluation
[18:51:54] <robertmaxrees> so really
[18:52:09] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to find an object in an array by the value of a property?
[18:52:26] <LooenyToones> ok...maybe this helps
[18:53:24] <robertmaxrees> zizzl and i wasn't necessarily talking about the beforesend - i was talking about the setHeader or w/e being a method call.
[18:53:29] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones >.>
[18:53:56] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/g417n52b/4/
[18:54:06] <LooenyToones> if i i have arr = [{obj1}, {obj2}, {obj3}] all 3 have keyName = 'name', so obj1.name = a, obj2.name = b, obj3.name. = c based on the value of obj[i].name === c delete that item
[18:54:25] <robertmaxrees> zizzl heh that's gonna error.
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones right.
[18:54:49] <robertmaxrees> so stepping back.
[18:55:10] <LooenyToones> or if obj1.name = 'a', exists in arr, and obj1.code = 'w", add
[18:55:11] <zizzl> woops
[18:55:13] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones the first thing you need is to find the object in an array by the value of a prop.
[18:55:31] <LooenyToones> yeah I've tried index of, but it evaluates false
[18:55:43] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/g417n52b/7/
[18:55:43] <robertmaxrees> because thjat's not the right tool for the job.
[18:55:50] <LooenyToones> ooooh :)
[18:56:21] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones this doens't have to do with that navigation question from yesterday, does it?
[18:56:29] <robertmaxrees> zizzl so now.
[18:56:33] <robertmaxrees> that won't work for the type.
[18:56:48] <LooenyToones> yes/no
[18:57:01] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones pick one ;)
[18:57:10] <LooenyToones> can I sit on fence and get sore?
[18:57:15] <zizzl> robertmaxrees: can you explain?
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> because if this is for figuring out where the user clicked through the menus, I gave you a solid answer for that issue.
[18:57:28] <LooenyToones> oh yeah....that works
[18:57:30] <robertmaxrees> zizzl let me show you an example that should show the problem.
[18:57:43] <LooenyToones> this is for doing something without a server call :)
[18:58:26] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones my suggestion had nothing to do with a server call.
[18:58:54] <LooenyToones> noooooo i'm not saying it did, :)
[18:59:21] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones i give up lol
[18:59:50] <LooenyToones> awww come on now....i haven't given up
[18:59:58] <LooenyToones> but you did get me thinking
[19:00:17] <LooenyToones> wrong tool for job...so think process what do I really want to do
[19:00:37] <LooenyToones> i want to find the object in an array with a key.value of something
[19:01:33] <LooenyToones> so that mean I need to iterate through an array, for a given key.value and return the object index number? since the index number would be unique in that specific instance.
[19:01:48] <LooenyToones> (instance > moment in time)
[19:01:49] <robertmaxrees> ziiz sorry - anyway.  did you verify that you're passing your conditional?
[19:01:53] <robertmaxrees> erer
[19:01:54] <robertmaxrees> zizzl
[19:02:02] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones nope.
[19:02:05] <robertmaxrees> no iterating.
[19:02:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[19:02:40] <zizzl> passing my conditional?
[19:02:46] <robertmaxrees> zizzl your if statementr?
[19:02:48] <zizzl> yeah I even remove it
[19:02:56] <zizzl> but yes everything inside is firing
[19:02:59] <robertmaxrees> zizzl and you're looking at your network tab?
[19:03:06] <zizzl> yes
[19:04:22] <LooenyToones> in that filter example: can you replace the numerical value of 6 with a variable in the event you don't know the actual length? or do you have to get the length store it in a variable then use the variable name so it actually point to a value
[19:05:36] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones huh?
[19:05:36] <zizzl> robertmaxrees, actually it may have worked
[19:05:44] <zizzl> thanks for your help
[19:05:54] <robertmaxrees> zizzl oh, rad.
[19:05:55] <zizzl> and good luck with the other crazy guy ;)
[19:06:04] <robertmaxrees> i was about to crack open the jqXHR object hahaha
[19:06:25] <LooenyToones> robert from the mdn link you provided ..... >>>> const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);
[19:06:29] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones what sort of browser support do you need?
[19:06:35] <robertmaxrees> and also: you didn't read the docs entirely.
[19:06:45] <LooenyToones>  swap word.length > a);
[19:07:02] <robertmaxrees> the index gets passed to the callback.
[19:07:08] <robertmaxrees> but also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
[19:07:19] <robertmaxrees> if you're using babel or any polyfills.
[19:07:57] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, since data mutation is bad, there's an inverse you can do.
[19:08:13] <robertmaxrees> since .filter() will accomplish this for you.
[19:08:36] <LooenyToones> robert: can i ask you about that last example: findIndex
[19:08:45] <LooenyToones> i saw that at like 2am this morning
[19:09:05] <LooenyToones> i've been studying JS (this is homework stuff - just learning) not job market ready yet
[19:09:10] <LooenyToones> anyway
[19:09:55] <LooenyToones> in that mdn example. its filtering for firstlargenumber > 13
[19:10:26] <LooenyToones> oh...that's why...nvmd
[19:10:28] <LooenyToones> d'oh
[19:10:51] <LooenyToones> the out put is 3, which is really 4, since array starts at 0, not 1
[19:10:52] <LooenyToones> d'oh
[19:11:55] <LooenyToones> anyway...sorry to piss ya off
[19:13:47] <robertmaxrees> you didn't piss me off duder.
[19:14:02] <robertmaxrees> just filter the array to exclude the particular object.  job done.
[19:14:40] <LooenyToones> aye
[19:15:13] <LooenyToones> working (1970's star trek voice) shit...i just dated myself
[19:15:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:19:45] <LooenyToones> and so I'm applying the filter...wron g
[19:19:52] <LooenyToones> cannot read property...of undefined
[19:20:18] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[19:23:47] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/376/
[19:24:05] <LooenyToones> line 44 -> 50
[19:24:14] <robertmaxrees> where's the filter?
[19:24:25] <LooenyToones> function nameGame
[19:24:46] <robertmaxrees> the word "filter" appears nowhere.
[19:24:59] <LooenyToones> gimme 1 sec
[19:26:39] <robertmaxrees> why are you defining a function within a function?
[19:28:33] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/382/
[19:28:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:28:56] <LooenyToones> maybe I don't have to, when I ready the examples, and I see it in a function, i think it needs its OWN function
[19:28:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use filter.
[19:30:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Syntax
[19:30:33] <robertmaxrees> you pass it a function.
[19:30:46] <robertmaxrees> also: eventObject.idzName = 'A' is not comparing anything.
[19:31:03] <robertmaxrees> that's trying to set thje idzName on the "eventObject" to "A"
[19:33:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/z0ktdzkm/1/ LooenyToones
[19:37:36] <LooenyToones> i get what's going on.
[19:37:41] <LooenyToones> your example works.
[19:37:46] <LooenyToones> i understand it
[19:38:03] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:38:15] <robertmaxrees> and stop defining functions inside of other functions - you don't need to do that :)
[19:41:34] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones you get your filter thing working?
[19:43:08] <LooenyToones> if i say no...you'll think I'm a dumb ass.
[19:43:19] <robertmaxrees> i won't.
[19:43:42] <LooenyToones> no..its bombing, the minute I apply any type of filter, i get cannot read property of 'push' of undefined
[19:43:47] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[19:43:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:43:54] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/396/
[19:44:06] <LooenyToones> l 40 - L 50
[19:44:24] <LooenyToones> that function 40 - 50 is where the array is actually created
[19:45:01] <LooenyToones> btw: just out of curiosity, is the noob like entry level material ?
[19:45:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:45:28] <LooenyToones> you know jr. dev, dev, sr.dev.
[19:45:42] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[19:46:19] <LooenyToones> this is stuff...a jr.dev should know, a dev would know, or a dev might know, an sr.dev should definitely know
[19:46:34] <LooenyToones> filters / arrays / objects / constructors / methods and so on
[19:46:36] <robertmaxrees> those can all be the same thing....
[19:46:58] <robertmaxrees> are you asking what level your questions are at?
[19:47:04] <LooenyToones> yes
[19:47:04] <robertmaxrees> like, asking me to judge your skillset?
[19:47:11] <LooenyToones> not skillset
[19:47:23] <LooenyToones> when someone starts LEARNING js.
[19:47:31] <LooenyToones> how far into the learning tree would this material be..
[19:47:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:47:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that depends.
[19:47:41] <robertmaxrees> on a lot of factors.
[19:48:21] <LooenyToones> well cuz there's that jr. dev title, and dev. title and sr. dev title so i'm curious what separates them apart
[19:48:40] <robertmaxrees> i know senior devs that don't know very much about javascript.
[19:48:55] <LooenyToones> how are they sr. devs. then?
[19:48:56] <LooenyToones> LOLOL
[19:49:06] <LooenyToones> idk
[19:49:08] <robertmaxrees> because they work in langauges that aren't javascript?
[19:49:08] <LooenyToones> not for me to say
[19:49:12] <LooenyToones> ohhh
[19:49:13] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't understand the question.
[19:49:14] <LooenyToones> i get it
[19:49:15] <LooenyToones> yeah
[19:49:20] <LooenyToones> i mean with respect to JS
[19:49:46] <LooenyToones> so I can't filter the array while making the array, cuz it throws a push error
[19:49:59] <LooenyToones> i'd have to create the array, then filter it afterwards
[19:50:24] <LooenyToones> but I thought line 41 eventList.push() would have made the array at least with 1 item
[19:50:35] <LooenyToones> and it does.
[19:50:39] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:50:44] <robertmaxrees> .push doesn't make arrays.
[19:50:59] <LooenyToones> ok i'm wording it wrong
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> let eList = makeEventList(eventObject);
[19:51:08] <robertmaxrees> and then function makeEventList(eventObject, eventList) {
[19:51:14] <robertmaxrees> that's your first problem.
[19:51:18] <LooenyToones> when I said...eventlist = []; that made an empty array
[19:51:24] <LooenyToones> correct?
[19:51:28] <robertmaxrees> you're calling it with one arg but not the second arg.
[19:53:12] <robertmaxrees> see the problem now?
[19:53:16] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/402/ like that?
[19:53:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j1xtvmLy/404/ or this.
[19:56:32] <LooenyToones> can I ask you something which may seem obvious but I'm missing it
[19:56:36] <LooenyToones> in this example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Syntax
[19:56:36] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:56:41] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:56:53] <LooenyToones> if you look at ES2015
[19:57:04] <LooenyToones> the fruits array
[19:57:41] <LooenyToones> if I read that line to myself it says
[19:59:01] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:59:03] <LooenyToones> create a variable named filterItems = and query (search) returning elements converting to a lower case all elements > -1 (-1 would produce a false, meaning the item doesn't exist in the area, 0 would be the 1st item in array).
[19:59:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:59:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:59:33] <LooenyToones> but....haven't really applied any filter, its like I just made the whole array small case
[19:59:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that's doing.
[19:59:48] <LooenyToones> ok...
[19:59:53] <LooenyToones> what is it doing?
[20:00:05] <robertmaxrees> it's simply lowercasing things for the purposes of comparing.
[20:00:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not changing the array it returns.
[20:00:13] <robertmaxrees> it's just a predicate.
[20:00:28] <LooenyToones> right...but why is that necessary
[20:00:40] <robertmaxrees> it isn't.
[20:00:43] <robertmaxrees> but it's helpful.
[20:00:57] <LooenyToones> ok...then on line 12 console.log(filterItems('ap'))
[20:01:05] <LooenyToones> that's the actual search
[20:01:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:01:16] <robertmaxrees> except it's not really a "search"
[20:01:18] <LooenyToones> because your pulling out all the items with 'ap' in it
[20:01:26] <LooenyToones> ok its a selection process
[20:01:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a filter heh
[20:01:49] <robertmaxrees> it's saying "for all objects in this array, test against this predicate
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> put differently "for each object, run this test"
[20:02:28] <LooenyToones> so its not really different than an IF statement If (a ===2), display
[20:02:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:02:48] <robertmaxrees> it is different though.
[20:02:57] <LooenyToones> cuz IF statements are test comparisons that evaluate to true or false
[20:03:22] <robertmaxrees> erm,.
[20:03:23] <LooenyToones> so...filter('ap'), tests for if the item has 'ap' in it, then its true, if not its false
[20:03:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:03:26] <LooenyToones> am i wrong?
[20:03:26] <robertmaxrees> nop.
[20:03:29] <robertmaxrees> *nope
[20:03:38] <LooenyToones> i not wrong?
[20:03:43] <LooenyToones> or I am wrong?
[20:03:46] <LooenyToones> lolol
[20:03:48] <robertmaxrees> you are wrong.
[20:03:55] <LooenyToones> explain pls
[20:03:57] <robertmaxrees> if statements are for control flow.
[20:04:12] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating control flow and comparisons.
[20:04:42] <LooenyToones> so if = true, do this, if = false, do that
[20:04:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:05:05] <robertmaxrees> except in the filter, you're just returning true or false
[20:05:17] <robertmaxrees> woops
[20:05:29] <LooenyToones> ok so if I make a variable = to the filter results
[20:05:39] <LooenyToones> then I would only have those items in the variable
[20:05:41] <LooenyToones> correct?
[20:05:50] <robertmaxrees> the items that pass the predicate, yes.
[20:05:57] <LooenyToones> hence I could have 2nd array of ojects that was filter out from 1st array of objects
[20:06:00] <LooenyToones> is that true
[20:06:05] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:06:09] <LooenyToones> grand
[20:06:19] <LooenyToones> so...
[20:06:35] <LooenyToones> i can use a filter statement to test if the item exists in arr1
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> so.
[20:06:43] <LooenyToones> correct? because if it returns false
[20:06:50] <LooenyToones> as -1, the item doesn't exist in arr1
[20:06:52] <LooenyToones> correct?
[20:06:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want to use filter for.
[20:07:12] <robertmaxrees> now you want to test if an array contains an object.
[20:07:25] <LooenyToones> well that would be the 1st step...wouldn't it
[20:07:38] <robertmaxrees> they're two logically distinct operations.
[20:07:38] <LooenyToones> then if i have multiples of the same items filter that
[20:07:43] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[20:07:44] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[20:07:46] <LooenyToones> oh
[20:07:51] <LooenyToones> kk,
[20:08:11] <robertmaxrees> so you have another operation you'd like to do - "Does this array contain an object meeting this predicate?"
[20:08:31] <LooenyToones> ok
[20:08:35] <robertmaxrees> right?
[20:08:39] <LooenyToones> right
[20:09:09] <LooenyToones> before you go further, tho....
[20:09:44] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:09:53] <LooenyToones> when you apply these types of inquiries to an array, does this exist, filter for this and so on, is it done in the SAME function that the array is populated, or in an indepent separate function or does it matter
[20:10:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:10:41] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about multiple things now.
[20:10:45] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[20:10:51] <robertmaxrees> and let's tackle these one at a time.
[20:10:59] <LooenyToones> ok...let me re-phrase the question.
[20:11:10] <LooenyToones> my brain functions as a library categorization system
[20:11:14] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[20:11:18] <robertmaxrees> but can we stay on track?
[20:11:21] <LooenyToones> yes.
[20:11:27] <robertmaxrees> so.
[20:11:36] <LooenyToones> remember you said, why am I writing a function within a function?
[20:11:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:11:43] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[20:11:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:11:55] <LooenyToones> ugh...nvmd
[20:11:58] <LooenyToones> sorry, go ahead
[20:12:00] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if an array contains an object that contains a predicate.
[20:12:04] <robertmaxrees> there's a method for that.
[20:12:10] <robertmaxrees> called .some()
[20:12:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[20:12:29] <robertmaxrees> "The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function."
[20:12:31] <dimi1947> I want to check if the radio button the user currently selects is different from the one pre-selected...I know this a comparison: https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5a7dpa8j/39/
[20:13:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that's a strange thing to want to know...
[20:13:47] <dimi1947> let me describe it in other words...
[20:15:03] <dimi1947> did you go to the fiddle?do you see that yes is checked?I just want to know if the user changed is selection from YES to NO...
[20:15:07] <robertmaxrees> also: pretty much the only case .attr() is appropriate dimi1947 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5a7dpa8j/41/
[20:16:00] <robertmaxrees> LooenyToones you get the whole array.some() thing worked out?
[20:18:14] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:thanks...I was thinking to be something more complicated....
[20:18:45] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 it's not necessarily ideal, and I'm still confused about why you need to know if it was changed, but sure! :)
[20:20:16] <LooenyToones> << bangs head
[20:20:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:20:33] <LooenyToones> i need to step back from the filter for a second.
[20:20:39] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:20:40] <LooenyToones> when you create an object
[20:21:12] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:21:15] <LooenyToones> and u make let x = new something(arg1, arg2, arg3)
[20:21:22] <LooenyToones> and then
[20:21:39] <LooenyToones> you try to access it
[20:22:03] <robertmaxrees> speaking in the abstract without an example is hard to wrap my head around.
[20:22:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:22:16] <LooenyToones> do you access it by the variable name x, or by the function name something for the purposes of accessing its properties x.name, or something.name
[20:22:40] <LooenyToones> https://jsfiddle.net/j1xtvmLy/417/
[20:22:47] <LooenyToones> in the fiddle, when I create the object.
[20:23:03] <robertmaxrees> when you create WHAT object?
[20:23:03] <LooenyToones> let eventObject = new eventDetails.
[20:23:12] <LooenyToones> line 27
[20:23:27] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[20:23:41] <LooenyToones> i return the eventObject.
[20:23:43] <robertmaxrees> why are you using new in this case?
[20:24:08] <LooenyToones> because everytime an event occurs I want to create a "new" object
[20:24:15] <LooenyToones> functionally it works
[20:25:09] <robertmaxrees> why not something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j1xtvmLy/419/ instead?
[20:25:50] <robertmaxrees> either way, I gotta jet.
[20:25:51] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
