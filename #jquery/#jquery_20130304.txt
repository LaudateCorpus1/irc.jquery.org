[00:01:29] <rumproast> i have a php file outputing a list of filenames.. trying to regex the name
[00:01:45] <dblosevn> you dont want the extension?
[00:01:52] <dblosevn> just the name?
[00:02:41] <rumproast> i believe so
[00:06:12] <rumproast> back.. but lost my chat log
[00:08:25] <rumproast> could u repost that regex?
[00:08:37] <someprimetime_> ?eval !/\.sql\.tar$/.test('50.EAST.228.84.sql.tar')
[00:08:39] <bot-t> someprimetime_: false
[00:52:37] <dblosevn> rumproast: super late but lol
[00:52:45] <dblosevn> ?eval '50.EAST.228.84.sql.tar'.replace(/(\.[a-z]{2,3}){1,2}$/ig, '')
[00:52:47] <bot-t> dblosevn: "50.EAST.228.84"
[00:52:56] <dblosevn> ?eval '50.EAST.228.84.tar'.replace(/(\.[a-z]{2,3}){1,2}$/ig, '')
[00:52:58] <bot-t> dblosevn: "50.EAST.228.84"
[00:52:59] <Cork> ?
[00:53:06] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[00:53:09] <dblosevn> pain in the ass lol
[00:53:49] <dblosevn> grab the filename portion of that string, conditionally on whether it has one or 2 extensions
[00:54:27] <Cork> well strictly the file name is 50
[00:54:32] <Cork> and the rest is extensions :)
[00:54:49] <dblosevn> ya i know right made it a pain to write that but i pulled it off lol
[00:55:12] <Cork> how long is the list of extensions you might encounter?
[00:55:29] <dblosevn> not me... rumproast
[00:56:18] <Cork> ?eval '50.EAST.228.84.sql.tar'.replace(/(.sql.tar|.tar)$/i, '')
[00:56:19] <bot-t> Cork: "50.EAST.228.84"
[00:56:27] <Cork> ?eval '50.EAST.228.84.tar'.replace(/(.sql.tar|.tar)$/i, '')
[00:56:28] <bot-t> Cork: "50.EAST.228.84"
[00:56:52] <dblosevn> ya but that doesnt meet the requirement of not knowing what the extension is
[00:56:59] <Cork> ah
[00:57:09] <dblosevn> i could have wrote that in my sleep lmao
[00:57:29] <dblosevn> tar.gz is the one that got me for a while
[00:57:36] <Cork> well the other one would have to depend on that the rest has a specific format though
[00:58:19] <dblosevn> ya that only works if its always numerical at the end
[00:58:28] <dblosevn> right before teh extension starts
[00:58:46] <Cork> ?eval '50.EAST.228.84.r00'.replace(/(\.[a-z]{2,3}){1,2}$/ig, '')
[00:58:47] <bot-t> Cork: "50.EAST.228.84.r00"
[00:58:51] <Cork> :/
[00:59:10] <dblosevn> no numbers in the extension lol
[00:59:20] <Cork> why its a valid rar extension
[00:59:42] <dblosevn> ya i know, but with his requirements i couldnt incorporate that
[00:59:43] <Cork> you just said you don't know whats in the extension
[00:59:54] <dblosevn> otehrwise hed end up with .84.tar
[01:00:07] <Cork> only way to make it dependable would be to have a list of extensions
[01:00:20] <Cork> everything else would be fragile
[01:00:23] <dblosevn> ya, thats how i would do it, but it was a fun regex to write lol
[01:00:30] <dblosevn> i dont know ereg that well
[01:00:43] <monokrome> hey
[01:00:52] <dblosevn> so the practice was fun
[01:01:01] <dblosevn> i mainly use preg
[01:01:15] <monokrome> Does anyone know how I can change $('.submenu > a') to still work after dynamic menus have been injected into the DOM?
[01:01:46] <Cork> ?eval var extensions = ['.tar', '.tar.gz']; '50.EAST.228.84.r00'.replace(new RegEx('(' + extensions.join('|') +')', 'i'), '')
[01:01:47] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: RegEx is not defined
[01:01:52] <Cork> ?eval var extensions = ['.tar', '.tar.gz']; '50.EAST.228.84.r00'.replace(new RegExp('(' + extensions.join('|') +')', 'i'), '')
[01:01:53] <bot-t> Cork: "50.EAST.228.84.r00"
[01:02:01] <Cork> ?eval var extensions = ['.tar', '.tar.gz', '.r00']; '50.EAST.228.84.r00'.replace(new RegExp('(' + extensions.join('|') +')', 'i'), '')
[01:02:02] <bot-t> Cork: "50.EAST.228.84"
[01:02:11] <Cork> dblosevn: thats how i wold do it :)
[01:02:47] <Cork> monokrome: $(parent).on('click', '.submenu > a', function() {})
[01:02:56] <dblosevn> $('sub-menus-parent').on('click', '.submenu > a', function (){}))
[01:03:01] <Cork> moneal: $() can't ever be dynamic
[01:03:01] <dblosevn> oh oops lol
[01:03:11] <dblosevn> beat me
[01:03:49] <monokrome> Thanks to both of you :)
[01:03:55] <Cork> dblosevn: you have parse error ;P
[01:04:01] <monokrome> 'on' always acts like delegate now?
[01:04:05] <Cork> no
[01:04:10] <dblosevn> when used in that context
[01:04:13] <Cork> monokrome: check the second parameter
[01:04:22] <monokrome> Sorry, that's what I meant :)
[01:04:23] <monokrome> Thank you
[01:04:31] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', '.submenu > a', function() {}) vs $('.submenu > a').on('click', function() {})
[01:05:13] <monokrome> Works
[01:05:14] <dblosevn> wouldnt that be hideously slow though?
[01:05:15] <monokrome> Thanks :)
[01:05:33] <dblosevn> the direct decendant op in a delegate?
[01:05:35] <Cork> dblosevn: no
[01:06:14] <dblosevn> being it not only would have to determine if its an `a` but if it was a direct decendant of .submenu as well
[01:06:57] <Cork> dblosevn: parent.selectorAll('.submenu > a') include this (psudo code)
[01:07:21] <Alarm> hello . i have a problem with a jquery progess bar inside an ajax call.  so what happens , i got a async: false setting in my ajax call . i do send several request to the server. on each response i also update the progress bar. this works pretty well on Firefox . The problem is with IE8. The progress bar does not appear or show the process.
[01:07:23] <dblosevn> ya but i didnt think it did that when the event bubbled up
[01:07:38] <dblosevn> i thought you just got e.target then it would have to match the selector
[01:07:55] <Alarm> Once i add an "alert();" before the setter of the progressbar is called , then the progress bar appears and seems to work
[01:08:16] <Alarm> once i remove the alert again from my ajax call, the progress bar never appears .
[01:08:27] <Alarm> any suggestions what could be the problem and whta could i look for to solve my problem ?
[01:08:35] <dblosevn> Alarm: wrap your code in a dom ready event
[01:08:59] <dblosevn> the alert is stopping the execution of your code long enough for the dom to become ready thats why its working then
[01:09:22] <dblosevn> eg ... $(function() {//yourcode });
[01:09:24] <Alarm> ok, i have to see how this can be done
[01:09:54] <Cork> dblosevn: exactly, but how would it match a selector?
[01:10:10] <Cork> unless you want to do the entire selector in js, thats the only way
[01:10:25] <dblosevn> i guess something like if ($(e.target).is('.submenu > a')
[01:10:45] <hip2p> After a few hours, I've redesigned my sort function, and it works perfectly in multiple browsers. Thanks for the help earlier.
[01:10:58] <Cork> dblosevn: and how would that translate to native?
[01:11:01] <Cork> :)
[01:11:18] <Cork> .is is used, but my point is what that becomes ^^
[01:11:47] <Alarm> dblosevn: sorry for being annoying, but is there any webpage showing any example of how this can be done ? what you just described with dom
[01:11:49] <dblosevn> honestly jquery has spoiled me, i havent wrote native DOM manipulation code i nyears
[01:11:59] <dblosevn> ? jquery.ready @ alarm
[01:12:04] <bot-t> alarm, .ready() | jQuery API Documentation - Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:12:18] <Cork> dblosevn: even if you normally don't write you should know what it becomes
[01:12:26] <Cork> else you don't know whats costly or not
[01:12:30] <Alarm> but i got a ready function already in my script
[01:12:49] <Cork> Alarm: you can define multiple ready listeners
[01:13:18] <Cork> $(function() { /* do 1 */ }); $(function() { /* do 2 */ }); $(function() { /* do 3 */ }); ...
[01:13:43] <Alarm> i see.
[01:13:48] <Alarm> ok will give it a try
[01:16:51] <dblosevn> what can i do with this to make it not hose my app when i have a semi intensive process going on? http://dblosevn.chosd.com/116
[01:17:29] <Cork> dblosevn: cache $('.ui-statusbar .ui-statusbar-right')
[01:17:48] <Cork> you doing dom traveling twice every 150 ms
[01:18:05] <Cork> (full dom traversing)
[01:18:27] <Cork> and actually
[01:18:34] <Cork> as you add and remove the class every time
[01:18:42] <Cork> you trigger reflow every 150 ms
[01:18:50] <Cork> store the state, and check if it has changed
[01:18:55] <Cork> and only then do something
[01:20:05] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/118 ?
[01:20:16] <dblosevn> just realized i was assigning state to window lol
[01:20:17] <Cork> also i would look at defining a setter if the browser supports it
[01:20:24] <Cork> that way you could do away with the setInterval
[01:20:53] <Cork> ?mdc object setter
[01:21:04] <bot-t> Cork, Working with objects - JavaScript | MDN - In principle, getters and setters can be either https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
[01:21:09] <Cork> wrong
[01:21:57] <Cork> ah, they've moved it around
[01:22:00] <dblosevn> all it does is make 2 images oscillate while the app is making ajax request
[01:22:39] <Cork> dblosevn: actually can you do it by calling a function instead of setting a variable?
[01:22:54] <dblosevn> well this is a method of my statusbar plug
[01:22:57] <Cork> that way it would work in all browsers, without the setInterval
[01:22:58] <dblosevn> *plugin
[01:23:21] <Cork> monitoring a variable through a timer is horrible to be honest
[01:23:57] <dblosevn> thats not monitoring it
[01:24:13] <dblosevn> its just toggling classes every 150ms
[01:24:14] <Cork> yes you are
[01:24:26] <Cork> ah
[01:24:28] <dblosevn> to make some blinky lights flash lol
[01:24:36] <Cork> ...
[01:25:09] <Cork> btw line 10 and 16 is still wrong
[01:25:49] <dblosevn> oops
[01:25:57] <dblosevn> ya i should make an animated gif i think
[01:26:28] <dblosevn> and just replace the gif with a jpg when its not animating
[01:26:52] <Cork> dblosevn: its prob the best ya
[01:27:06] <Cork> remember that the animation will start where it was when you use it again though
[01:27:17] <Cork> (gif files doesn't reset when you add them again)
[01:27:38] <dblosevn> it doesnt really matter, its just an indicator that data is being transferred or recieved
[01:27:48] * Cork nods
[01:28:14] <Cork> i converted mov files to gifs ones upon a time :)
[01:28:35] <dblosevn> i hooked it into ajaxstart and ajaxstop so it just starts and stops automagically
[01:28:37] <Cork> it hit me quite hard when he happend upon it :)
[01:28:59] <Cork> was a bit hacky to solve it
[01:29:21] <dblosevn> suprised me at first but it even works while uploading files with html5 uploads
[01:29:37] <Cork> why wouldn't it?
[01:29:48] <Cork> html file upload is just a plain ajax post
[01:30:06] <Cork> where the file data has been loaded with the File API
[01:30:34] <dblosevn> i would have thought it used something else although im having an issue there too, larger files take forever to finish after all data has been uploaded
[01:30:51] <dblosevn> hence going back and trying to fix all the not so nice code
[01:31:33] <dblosevn> about 15 to 30 seconds after the file has been 100% uploaded i get the response back from the server
[01:32:54] <dblosevn> ive definitely got something going on because the progress bar isnt really smooth anymore either, its real jerky, so im trying to cut back on the already very few things i have that have timers
[01:33:36] <ShamanIotasTook> question: how would i pick a color or a border that will correspond with a jquery ui 'active'...note, it's a plugin i'm developing so i want it to tie to the css, not hard-coded colorhex
[01:33:40] <Cork> your prob looping an array you get back or something
[01:34:08] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: just add the ui class to your element
[01:34:13] <Alarm> unfortunately , adding my code that is updating the progress bar value inside a $(document).ready did not change anything
[01:34:29] <Alarm> i still do not see the progress bar value changing .
[01:34:47] <dblosevn> its weird, i watch the net tab and the request doesnt even show up until 20-30 seconds after theupload compeltes
[01:35:06] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: .ui-widget-content
[01:35:22] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: then override what you don't want in your own class
[01:35:52] <Cork> dblosevn: sounds like your doing something syncronically
[01:36:06] <dblosevn> it definitely feels that way
[01:36:13] <ShamanIotasTook> nothing has border...so how to get  color of like 'ui-active' for example?
[01:36:26] <ShamanIotasTook> not for a particular ui-css, but for any ui-css that may be applied
[01:36:31] <dblosevn> but the interface isnt blocked while im waiting on the response
[01:36:44] <ShamanIotasTook> if nothing else, i'll just use white border
[01:36:58] <dblosevn> i can cancel the upload, or choose to load another panel or anything really
[01:37:01] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: .ui-widget-content.ui-state-active
[01:37:27] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: the theming of ui is quite simple its just adding the classes you want
[01:37:31] <dblosevn> and that happens fast, it would seem if something was blocking syncronously i wouldnt be able to do anything?
[01:37:40] <ShamanIotasTook> that will give colored borders?
[01:37:52] <ShamanIotasTook> thanks
[01:38:01] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: no .ui-widget-content gives you colored borders
[01:38:14] <Cork> .ui-state-active gives you the active state of the element
[01:38:38] <Cork> so .ui-widget-content.ui-state-active gives you the active border color of the element
[01:38:49] <Cork> (and background color and image and so on)
[01:39:22] <ShamanIotasTook> thanks :)
[01:41:21] <dblosevn> other uploaders ive used in the past seemed to chuck the request to the controlleer this one seems like it writes the whole file out in one request
[01:42:05] <Cork> dblosevn: they all do that; unless they do multiple posts in parallel
[01:42:23] <Cork> the controller part is just how the server parses and splits the data
[01:42:26] <dblosevn> ya the last one i usedwrote out like 200k chunks
[01:42:49] <Cork> to get around server post size limitations
[01:42:51] <dblosevn> supported pausing and resuming etc
[01:43:36] <dblosevn> true never thought about that, i havent used shared hosting in so long, it never corssed my mind
[01:44:02] <Cork> you almost always want it anyway, unless the server isn't using php
[01:44:19] <dblosevn> well actually i had one a couple weeks ago i had to write a perl upload controller because the host didnt allow mods to the php ini and the upload_max_size was 2mb
[01:44:20] <Cork> as post is mime encoded and all the data is stored in memory before its flushed to disk
[01:44:26] <Cork> so it consumes
[01:44:30] <Cork> A LOT of memory
[01:45:15] <Cork> <file size> * 1.4 == memory usage needed
[01:45:57] <dblosevn> didnt think about that either, might need to bump that up
[01:46:23] <dblosevn> some of the files are 1gb plus, and memory_limit is like 250mb
[01:47:00] <Cork> thats a ram usage of 1434 mb for that single file :s
[01:47:04] <dblosevn> i assumed php wrote out file file to /tmp as it recieved it, it actually reads the whole file into memory?
[01:47:18] <Cork> the mime encoded data ya
[01:47:25] <Cork> when it decodes it its written to disk
[01:47:40] <Cork> thats where the .4 comes from
[01:47:44] <dblosevn> i might choose to go with a perl controller then
[01:47:57] <Cork> base64 is ~40% bigger then the raw data
[01:48:44] <ShamanIotasTook> ok, that's working, but i'm having a hard time overriding the border:1px solid #color (i want to keep #color but override to be either 4px inset or outset)
[01:49:00] <dblosevn> or not only python and php are supproted and my perl is nowhere near good enough to write this controlelr lol
[01:49:36] <dblosevn> well node and go are supported as well
[01:49:38] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: .my-class.ui-widget-content.ui-state-active { border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; }
[01:49:41] <wenic> hello
[01:50:31] <ShamanIotasTook> THANKS! :)
[01:50:36] <ShamanIotasTook> still learning these classes
[01:50:43] <ShamanIotasTook> hard to search some of them, like this one
[01:50:45] <ShamanIotasTook> much appreciated
[01:50:51] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: its basic css :)
[01:51:09] <ShamanIotasTook> yep
[01:51:15] <Cork> if you want to override something, make your selector more specific
[01:51:30] <dblosevn> or i guess i could justt pass in the config option to chunk the upload lol
[01:55:39] <jkarsrud> who in here is in charge of the blog.jquery.com theme?
[01:57:01] <jkarsrud> or is it on github, so I could do a pull-request?
[01:57:08] <Cork> jkarsrud: i'm actually not sure they frequent here at all actually
[01:57:33] <jkarsrud> Cork: aight, I'll look on github then =)
[01:57:50] <Cork> jkarsrud: anyway https://github.com/jquery
[01:57:56] <Cork> some of it are there
[01:58:10] <jkarsrud> yeah, I _think_ I might have found it now ;)
[01:58:41] <ravenzz> ok, I have this page in which I replace a link with an iframe, is there a way to propagate events (clicks in my case) from the target page up to the parent window? http://jsfiddle.net/nAz2W/
[01:59:09] <Cork> ravenzz: same domain?
[01:59:12] <ravenzz> yes
[01:59:34] <ShamanIotasTook> cork +10 that worked perfectly! just wanted to let you know results were perfect.
[02:00:04] <Cork> ravenzz: you would have to catch the event in the page in the iframe
[02:00:13] <Cork> ravenzz: and then fake it in the parent page
[02:00:24] <ravenzz> Cork I need to do a redirect actually, maybe window.top.href would be enough?
[02:00:37] <Cork> yes
[02:00:53] <Cork> or window.parent.location = 'new-location'
[02:01:17] <ravenzz> great :) why I didn't think about it before ..
[02:01:17] <Cork> not sure top has a href actually, i think it should be top.location
[02:02:48] <ravenzz> yes my bad
[02:03:44] <wenic> hello is there any good tutorials to code the pop up type image sliders
[02:09:12] <lejocelyn> hi, is it possible to hash some content with jquery ? and just before it is sent to the php script ?
[02:09:18] <lejocelyn> like for instance
[02:09:40] <lejocelyn> if I do a .on('click', function)
[02:09:57] <lejocelyn> when someone click on the submit, it will be too late, no ?
[02:10:23] <monokrome> not if you prevent default
[02:10:50] <lejocelyn> monokrome: what do you mean by preventing default ?
[02:12:00] <monokrome> on('click', function (evt) { evt.preventDefault(); })
[02:12:10] <monokrome> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:12:18] <lejocelyn> ok, I'll read this
[02:12:19] <lejocelyn> thanks
[02:12:33] <monokrome> np =]
[02:13:40] <lejocelyn> is jquery website's down ?
[02:14:03] <dblosevn> nope
[02:14:06] <Cork> lejocelyn: you shouldn't do click on the submit button; you should listen for submit on the form
[02:14:10] <Cork> ?down jquery.com
[02:14:11] <b-ot> Cork: It's just you. http://jquery.com is up! (200 OK)
[02:14:20] <wenic> :)
[02:14:34] <dblosevn> :-( i couldnt remember the bot command lol
[02:15:09] <dblosevn> i thought it was something crazy like itdoiijm lol
[02:15:15] <lejocelyn> rah, KDE's kio fille is buggy again
[02:15:17] <lejocelyn> sorry
[02:15:42] <dblosevn> cork killed the bot lmao
[02:15:59] <Cork> dblosevn: b-ot vs bot-t
[02:16:06] <dblosevn> oh thats the other one, he died hours ago
[02:16:18] <lejocelyn> Cork: is listen a parameter of on ?
[02:16:18] <Cork> uh no
[02:16:35] <Cork> lejocelyn: what do you mean?
[02:16:51] <lejocelyn> on('listen', function ?
[02:16:54] <Cork> no
[02:17:11] <Cork> lejocelyn: you want to do $('form').on('submit', function() {})
[02:17:21] <lejocelyn> not really
[02:17:32] <lejocelyn> if listen is better
[02:17:36] <dblosevn> :-) ^^
[02:17:37] <Cork> instead of $('form input[type="submit"]').on('click', function() {});
[02:17:55] <lejocelyn> ah ok, I get it
[02:17:55] <Cork> lejocelyn: listen makes no sense, what would it trigger on?
[02:18:14] <lejocelyn> from the user microphone ? ;)
[02:18:21] <lejocelyn> ok, that was stupid
[02:18:34] <lejocelyn> of me, I mean
[02:18:50] <dblosevn> he was simply saying to attach a listener to the forms submit event lol
[02:19:21] <dblosevn> not to literally attach to the nonexistant form event listen lol
[02:19:57] <Cork> on == addEventListener
[02:20:18] <dblosevn> well now that i enabled chucked uploading, it doesnt hang at the end of the upload anymore but the progressbar isnt as pretty
[02:20:28] <lejocelyn> I guess learning Javascript with Jquery has some flaws
[02:21:45] <dblosevn> its not smooth at all, i wonder does ui=progressbar support animated progress updates?
[02:22:11] <dblosevn> so it doesnt jerk to the new progress value
[02:23:46] <Cork> dblosevn: don't think it does it by default
[02:24:00] <Cork> but there shouldn't be anything preventing you from adding it
[02:24:11] <dblosevn> it seems to now only update progress at the end of a chunk
[02:24:27] <Cork> it updates every time it gets new value
[02:24:40] <Cork> most likely when you chunk it you don't get any partials
[02:25:25] <dblosevn> when before it was updating every 100ms thats probally the timer that was killing me, i happened to see that in the docs when i was trying to find the option for chucked uploading
[02:26:16] <dblosevn> theres anotehr tiemr it uses to to calc bitrate, and i dont even display the bitrate
[02:32:50] <lejocelyn> hum, there 's no simple solution to hash a word from javascript
[02:32:54] <lejocelyn> I should have guess it
[02:35:44] <dblosevn> as far as I know theres no buiilt in crypto functions in js, these look promising though http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/scripts.html @ lejocelyn
[02:36:10] <lejocelyn> I found that one too http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/
[02:42:12] <Cork> dblosevn: http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/
[02:42:55] <Cork> doing cryptation in javascript, isn't considered trusted
[02:43:20] <lejocelyn> I can guess, after all, it's the user's software we're using
[02:44:11] <dblosevn> i cant think of a reason i have ever needed to hash anything with js, thats something far better suited for a compiled language
[02:44:32] <dblosevn> thats what they built ssl for lol
[02:44:38] <lejocelyn> ... :)
[02:44:48] <lejocelyn> but if you can't have ssl on your server ?
[02:44:58] <dblosevn> get one you can?
[02:45:05] <lejocelyn> no
[02:46:08] <lejocelyn> bah, never mind, it's just for a test server
[02:46:18] <lejocelyn> the production server will have ssl
[02:46:37] <dblosevn> basically all shared hosts allow ssl, and theres places that will give you free certs just for buying a domain
[02:47:17] <Cork> dblosevn: request signing
[02:47:19] <Cork> for example
[02:47:32] <lejocelyn> I know, but I don't have access to the server's conf
[02:47:47] <Cork> lejocelyn: the problem is that third party can extract the secrets from js, so its not seen as trustworthy
[02:48:02] <dblosevn> ya i wouldnt want to expose my hash techniques to the public
[02:48:16] <Cork> dblosevn: and there is places that will just give you a free ssl cert
[02:48:21] <Cork> no requierments at all
[02:48:44] <lejocelyn> but sha1 technic is well known and no one complains
[02:49:10] <Cork> lejocelyn: that would be obfuscation
[02:49:16] <Cork> the secret is the private key
[02:49:19] <dblosevn> ya, havent found any of them though that had well distributed CA roots though :-( except when i hosted with singlehop they gave me unlimited verisign certs
[02:49:45] <dblosevn> ya you dont wanna have the salt n a human readable js file
[02:49:47] <Cork> and if js can get the private key, so can sniffers
[02:50:08] <lejocelyn> Cork: ah true
[02:50:08] <Cork> dblosevn: the salt could be a random number, and that wouldn't matter
[02:50:32] <Cork> whats problematic is the key used to cryptate the data before you hash it
[02:50:42] <Cork> (or after)
[02:51:06] <Cork> if you ex. hash a password before sending it, that would make the hashing totally pointless
[02:51:09] <lejocelyn> I hope no one will give their true password on the test server, I'll send a notice so that people don't do it
[02:51:17] <lejocelyn> but I'm not sure they'll read it
[02:52:04] <lejocelyn> I hash the password on the server side, but if someone is sniffing data on the network
[02:52:12] <Cork> lejocelyn: sounds like that test server should be in the private network and not public
[02:52:37] <lejocelyn> Cork: true, but what is the private network is quite big
[02:52:38] <lejocelyn> ?
[02:52:42] <Cork> lejocelyn: hashing won't protect agents sniffing
[02:53:14] <Cork> lejocelyn: only way to make it relatively safe is by encrypting the communication
[02:53:26] <lejocelyn> I know, but I can't yet
[02:53:33] <Cork> the hash is what the server sees as plain text
[02:53:44] <Cork> so.. it could just as well be the plain password
[02:54:04] <Cork> the protection is that what the server get and what the server stores is different
[02:54:20] <Cork> and none of that protect ageist network sniffing
[02:54:46] <lejocelyn> I know, but I can't get a cert at this point
[02:55:00] <Cork> a hashed password take exactly as much effort to read from an unencrypted connection as the real password
[02:55:18] <Cork> lejocelyn: ya, but i want to make clear to you that what your doing isn't adding any security
[02:55:21] <lejocelyn> anyway, I'll notice the ten people helping with the tests not to give any real world password
[02:55:33] <Cork> just so you don't expect it to make a security difference
[02:55:42] <lejocelyn> Cork: it's plain clear
[02:55:56] <lejocelyn> ok, got to eat
[02:56:10] <Cork> its to the point where i don't even understand why you bother to hash it actually
[02:57:16] <lejocelyn> Cork: me neither but it's within the requierement :)
[02:57:27] <Cork> ...
[02:57:45] <Cork> who makes up these ridiculous rules...
[02:57:48] <dblosevn> <--> which way did he go
[02:58:13] <lejocelyn> Cork: well, there will be ssl on the production server
[02:58:24] <lejocelyn> ok; got to go
[03:02:12] <Novalgina2Fast> hi everybody, i can't put this to works, it's a jquery function who should change the the text with an array of different phrases, the file.js is external http://jsfiddle.net/UqY2C/
[03:03:20] <obert> hi, do you got a suggestion to find a plugin/script to do 'add this to clipboard'?
[03:03:37] <Cork> obert: flash
[03:03:41] <obert> oh
[03:03:43] <Cork> you can't do it from javascript
[03:04:40] <obert> then stackoverflow people were right seems
[03:05:40] <obert> thanks
[03:26:05] <sahbeewah> can someone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/tNdjz/
[03:26:59] <quazimodo> why does .trigger() 'bubble' up the tree+
[03:27:00] <quazimodo> ?
[03:27:15] <quazimodo> what is the architectural or engineering purpose behind that behaviour?
[03:28:00] <sahbeewah> because if you're triggering an event to an element, you're triggering an event to all of its parent nodes
[03:28:22] <sahbeewah> and it makes sense that they should be notified that you triggered that event
[03:29:22] <quazimodo> i guess it can be useful
[03:31:06] <systemfault> quazimodo: If you have: <a href="#"><span>Hello</span> World</a>, without bubbling, what would happen when you'd click on "Hello"?
[03:34:03] <systemfault> Think about it and you'll understand why bubbling exists.
[03:37:53] <dhnek> Hey
[03:37:58] <dhnek> someone can help me?
[03:38:55] <Cork> ?ask @ dhnek
[03:38:55] <b-ot> dhnek: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:38:56] <bot-t> dhnek, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:39:15] <quazimodo> systemfault: yes your example makes sense. Does the a cause bubbling to stop automatically?
[03:39:29] <dhnek> I have one div, the div have a style (z-index=3)
[03:39:31] <sacho> no
[03:39:34] <dhnek> but, have 3 more divs
[03:39:41] <Cork> quazimodo: no, bubbling happens until it reaches the end of the dom
[03:39:53] <systemfault> quazimodo: No, that's the reason why it's illegal in HTML to have an <a> in a <a>
[03:39:54] <dhnek> i need find the div who have z-index=3
[03:40:00] <Cork> all events that bubbles does this by default
[03:40:08] <dhnek> i need use .attr or what?
[03:40:28] <systemfault> quazimodo: Bubbling can be useful in another way…. event delegation
[03:40:59] <Cork> dhnek: $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).css('z-index') == 3;  })
[03:41:36] <dhnek> i will try, thanks Cork
[03:42:27] <b10s> 111
[03:43:05] <Cork> -2 == 101
[03:44:35] <systemfault> On a 3bit architecture? :/
[03:45:06] <systemfault> signed arithmetic on a 3bit computer must rock...
[03:45:23] <Cork> :)
[03:45:34] <Cork> systemfault: never said it was signed
[03:46:10] <Cork> you can still take two unsigned values minus each other
[03:46:31] <systemfault> You'd never get a negative number..
[03:46:38] <Cork> sure
[03:46:42] <Cork> 101 isn't negative
[03:46:43] <systemfault> You'd get a wrap around.
[03:46:56] <Cork> 7 - 2
[03:47:03] <dhnek> Cork, i need click this div...
[03:47:08] <dhnek> $('.slideItem').filter(function() {  		 var clicka = return $(this).css('z-index') == 3; 		 $(clicka).click(function () { 			alert("a");  		 }); 		})
[03:47:14] <dhnek> doesn't work
[03:47:25] <Cork> dhnek: $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).css('z-index') == 3;  }).click()
[03:47:25] <quazimodo> interesting :)
[03:47:38] <Cork> that will click it
[03:48:22] <systemfault> Cork: You sure 101 isn't -2 with one's complement?
[03:48:48] <Cork> systemfault: val1 val2 isn't a valid mathematical expression
[03:48:56] <wingedsnake> hello
[03:49:03] <wingedsnake> can i paste 2 lines of code here?
[03:49:05] <Cork> systemfault: what you talked about would be val1 + -val2
[03:49:21] <dhnek> $('.slideItem').filter(function() { return $(this).css('z-index') == 3;  }).click(function () { 			alert("A"); 		});
[03:49:31] <dhnek> alert doesn't shows...
[03:49:36] <dhnek> can you tell me why ?
[03:49:39] <Cork> dhnek: didn't you say you wanted to trigger the click?
[03:49:48] <Cork> that adds a listener
[03:49:49] <quazimodo> LOL Goddam Return ... using coffee script sucks when you have a mistabbed return above your mysteriously ignored code
[03:49:52] <quazimodo> hahahaha
[03:50:00] <dhnek> cork: if click this div, alert("a")
[03:50:03] <quazimodo> that took an hour
[03:50:27] <dhnek> i have 4 divs but 1 have z-index = 3, if click on this div alert("a")
[03:53:27] <Cork> oh, loverly my browser crashed >_>
[03:54:59] <Cork> dhnek: http://jsfiddle.net/yUkFP/2/
[03:55:41] <wingedsnake>     var dialog1 = $("#div_viewaddialog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, height: 450, width: 600, modal: true});
[03:55:41] <wingedsnake>     dialog1.load("./viewad.php?Id="+AdId).dialog('open');
[03:55:53] <wingedsnake> it's working fine
[03:55:59] <xec> Cork: z-index don't work on position: static; elements
[03:56:02] <wingedsnake> but after a few clicks it's dying
[03:56:14] <Cork> xec: sure, but its still sat
[03:56:23] <Cork> xec: and that was all it was about
[03:56:29] <xec> Cork: not in chrome, apparently
[03:56:37] <dhnek> Cork, doesn't work
[03:56:44] <dhnek> I will try on firefox
[03:56:46] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/yUkFP/3/
[03:57:12] <dhnek> xec, works!
[03:57:18] <Cork> xec: interesting, didn't know it did that
[03:57:28] <Cork> though it wouldn't cross my mind to do filtering like that
[03:57:34] <xec> Cork: me neither, a bit odd tbh
[04:00:31] <dhnek> lol, on my page doesn't works
[04:00:40] <dhnek> anyway, thanks!
[04:01:38] <krz> y'all have any good preloaded gif/pngs?
[04:01:47] <krz> transparent hopefully, that don't suck
[04:01:54] <xec> preloaded?
[04:02:01] <krz> preloaders
[04:02:17] <xec> preloader gif?
[04:02:25] <krz> yes
[04:02:25] * xec is still confused
[04:02:30] <krz> google
[04:03:13] <xec> ah right. i've just called them loading gifs
[04:03:33] <xec> have you seen spin.js?
[04:03:55] <krz> hm interesting
[04:03:59] <krz> thanks for that
[04:04:07] <krz> most loaders don't have good transaprency
[04:04:10] <krz> look dull etc
[04:14:42] <quazimodo> alert($(self).children('td input').attr('checked'));  <--- why would that return undefined?
[04:15:30] <systemfault> Because it doesn't have the checked attribute?
[04:16:24] <xec> quazimodo: because the first input isn't a checkbox? or the selector doesnt return anything? or self isn't what you want it to be?
[04:17:11] <quazimodo> zedzedzed it is failing and now I'm sad :(
[04:18:00] <quazimodo> well it's certainly returning an Object object
[04:18:20] <mieszkos> guys how to make something like, when u have on website geolocation button and then if someone didnt share position do nothing, but if someone shared find.. (you)..
[04:18:27] <Cork> quazimodo: your looking for an attribute, but most likely want the property
[04:18:34] <Cork> quazimodo: try protp('checked')
[04:18:50] <Cork> *prop('checked'=
[04:18:52] <Cork> BAH
[04:18:55] <Cork> *prop('checked')
[04:18:59] <xec> :D
[04:19:20] <mieszkos> any1?
[04:19:46] <quazimodo> Cork: this is freaking ridiculous :/
[04:20:09] <Cork> quazimodo: not really, your looking at whats in the dom attribute
[04:20:15] <xec> you're*
[04:20:23] <Cork> and that doens't change since the original html is parsed
[04:20:39] <Cork> if you want chicken, don't hunt for ducks
[04:20:43] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/quazimodo/93372fbc43e5ae766043
[04:21:20] <Cork> quantax-: attr('checked', false) doesn't mean anything
[04:21:24] <Cork> *quazimodo:
[04:21:53] <Cork> its attr('checked', 'checked') / removeAttr('checked')
[04:22:01] <quazimodo> reload it
[04:22:02] <Cork> or prop('checked', true) / or prop('checked', false)
[04:22:08] <quazimodo> oh
[04:22:32] <Cork> and you SHOULD use the last one
[04:22:41] <quazimodo> that's to set it
[04:22:45] <quazimodo> what about to get it?
[04:22:53] <Cork> or prop('checked')
[04:23:06] <quazimodo> I don't think that's working
[04:23:13] <quazimodo> 1 moment pls
[04:23:17] <Cork> it does
[04:23:51] <quazimodo> prop('checked') returns undefined over and over
[04:23:51] <Cork> remember though it will only get the first element if you match multiple
[04:23:59] <quazimodo> yep there's only 1
[04:24:04] <Cork> on what input type?
[04:24:32] <Cork> and the selector matches?
[04:24:43] <Cork> ah
[04:24:44] <xec> quazimodo: self is a tr. the input is not a child, but a grandchild
[04:24:44] <Cork> no
[04:24:59] <Cork> quazimodo: .children('td input') won't work
[04:25:08] <xec> indeed, it would never
[04:25:14] <xec> you want .find()
[04:25:23] <Cork> it will try to select input elements that has td as a parent and is a child of tr...
[04:25:33] <Cork> won't really work :)
[04:25:54] <mazzachre> I have an interesting problem... I have a page that initializes some items by calling $('#someSelector').trigger('change'); in order to run the code that the selector have... Problem is now, the customer wants the selector to save it's state to the backend, no problem I add an Ajax call to 'change' as well as initialize the "selected" state of the selector... Now only problem is that the initializtion of the page also calls the
[04:25:54] <mazzachre> "save" function. It all works, but it is an unnessecary call to backend and unnessecary save to database etc... How can I help this?!
[04:26:25] <quazimodo> well... td is a child of tr?
[04:26:36] <Cork> quazimodo: ya, but your not selecting that
[04:26:38] <quazimodo> and td is its parent
[04:26:46] <quazimodo> oh right
[04:26:46] <Cork> .children('td').children('input') would
[04:26:46] <quazimodo> gotcha
[04:26:47] <quazimodo> XD
[04:26:52] <quazimodo> yep undrestood
[04:26:56] <quazimodo> *HUG* SORRY CORK!
[04:26:58] * quazimodo gets it
[04:27:11] <quazimodo> holy balls I'm sometimes viciously stupid
[04:27:17] <quazimodo> its rather remarkable
[04:27:34] <xec> don't beat yourself up, happens to all of us :P
[04:27:52] <xec> coffee helps.
[04:28:18] <Cork> xec: as long as you don't pore it into your scripts ;)
[04:28:37] <quazimodo> coffee as a drink
[04:28:40] <quazimodo> or as a language
[04:28:46] <xec> the drink ;)
[04:28:57] <xec> caffeinated.
[04:28:57] <Cork> lol, that was the joke, ya ^^
[04:29:00] <dblosevn> def not the language, now i need some coffee
[04:29:26] <xec> Cork: also: pour*
[04:29:29] <xec> ;D
[04:29:37] <quazimodo> what's wrong with coffee script
[04:29:40] <dblosevn> i was gonna let it slide lol
[04:29:42] <Cork> ah, suspected that, was too lazy to look it up though
[04:29:44] <quazimodo> I find it much more everythingly better
[04:29:49] <BillyJoe_> Using jquery-mobile I want to display data like a ListView with data-inset="true". BUT, I have multiple columns with varying widths (depending on content). It seems like ListView supports inset but not columns, and table doesn't support inset but supports columns. Is there no good standard way to achieve both? Or would I need to use a ListView and then calculate column widths using javascript?
[04:30:01] <Novalgina2Fast> hi everybody, i can't put this to works, it's a jquery function who should change the the text with an array of different phrases, the file.js is external http://jsfiddle.net/UqY2C/
[04:30:06] <xec> quazimodo: can i quote you on that?
[04:30:16] <Cork> quazimodo: if nothing else, implicit returns
[04:30:23] <quazimodo> Cork: that bit shits me too
[04:30:24] <xec> CoffeeScript - "It much more everythingly better"
[04:30:40] <quazimodo> xec: go for it :D
[04:30:43] <Cork> and i hate tab sensitive syntaxes
[04:30:44] <xec> :D
[04:31:10] <quazimodo> Cork: I don't. Then again I actually like LISP syntax
[04:31:13] <systemfault> Coffeescript… is so useless :P
[04:31:14] <quazimodo> go figure
[04:31:37] <Cork> and i don't find it adding anything you can achieve in js if you choose to write it in another way (at lest not that matters)
[04:31:55] <Cork> *you can't
[04:32:12] <dblosevn> ya i looked at it for all of 5 minutes, maybe i missed something lmao
[04:32:20] <Cork> lol
[04:32:29] <quazimodo> Cork: the absurd )};)); things sometimes can be pain
[04:32:32] <Cork> i've written projects in it
[04:32:39] <quazimodo> but I'm not a js guy so yeah
[04:32:46] <Cork> quazimodo: so don't use inline functions
[04:33:05] <dblosevn> ya a buddy of mine did too, i never got into it
[04:33:14] <Cork> never said i did
[04:33:18] <Cork> just that i have
[04:33:27] <Cork> now days i remove it if i can
[04:33:36] <Cork> (and most of the time i can :D )
[04:33:51] <dblosevn> forot what he did or who he worked for but they had a whole suite of apps that were wrtten in it
[04:33:58] <dblosevn> forgot even
[04:34:21] <Cork> i don't think i could live without scss though
[04:34:58] <Cork> its possibly feasible to actually support all freeking browser bugs
[04:35:04] <dblosevn> so i wonder if this `go` thing is gonna take off, i breifly read about it once and now im starting to see open source software with ports for it
[04:35:24] <Cork> dblosevn: you mean golang?
[04:35:28] <dblosevn> ya
[04:35:32] <Cork> ya, its really nice
[04:35:42] <Cork> for server code that is
[04:35:54] <Cork> wouldn't use it for an application
[04:36:47] <systemfault> Cork: SCSS is lovely, I couldn't live without it now.
[04:36:51] <dblosevn> i think i want to learn node before that, i think that would be far more useful
[04:37:14] <Cork> systemfault: they'r talking about adding it to css4 :)
[04:37:34] <systemfault> Yeah right ;)
[04:37:36] <dblosevn> and we can start using it in like 10 years :-)
[04:37:42] <Cork> dblosevn: node isn't very performant
[04:37:49] <Cork> systemfault: you want a link to the spec draft?
[04:38:16] <systemfault> Cork: Sure :P
[04:38:35] <systemfault> Cork: AFAIK, there's only a spec for CSS variables
[04:39:13] <Cork> systemfault: i said talking about, no browser supports it yet
[04:40:05] <Cork> systemfault: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-hierarchies/
[04:40:40] <systemfault> Whoa :D
[04:40:45] <Cork> there is one more don't remember its name though
[04:42:51] <Cork> systemfault: but man that would break A LOT of css parsers XD
[04:43:11] <systemfault> Exactly what I was thinking at this precise moment :P
[04:43:34] <Cork> dblosevn: actually the css development is shortening its cycles
[04:43:38] <Cork> just like the browsers
[04:43:53] <Cork> so most likely it won't be 10 years anymore, but more like 3
[04:43:58] <mazzachre> OK, this might not be the pretties solution to my problem, but I have moved the ajax handling out to it's own event handler, which I add with a ".one" handler to on change... So the initial call to change, made by myself to initialize the page also adds the ajax handler but does not make the ajax call, where the other calls make the ajax call...
[04:44:07] <dblosevn> we still cant get peops to ditch ie6 lol
[04:44:17] <Cork> dblosevn: O_o'
[04:44:23] <Cork> seriously?
[04:44:41] <Cork> most places i know start to look at ditching ie7 now
[04:44:44] <hooloovoo> dblosevn: there are like 0.1% that use IE6. :P
[04:44:46] <dblosevn> much less css3 and now were talking css4
[04:45:21] <Cork> dblosevn: css3 isn't compleate yet
[04:45:35] <dblosevn> i really think before they move on to css4 they need to sit down and standardize css3, and get all the browsers using the same spec
[04:45:42] <Cork> the spec needs to be worked through to get a recommendation
[04:46:01] <Cork> then it needs to go through the implementation face
[04:46:15] <Cork> after that it goes to the bug and revision state
[04:46:15] <dblosevn> im tired of all this moz- webkit- o- crap lol
[04:46:28] <Cork> dblosevn: that solution is depricated
[04:46:33] <systemfault> I think we"re stuck with modules now… no more "CSS X" spec
[04:46:40] <Cork> there isn't any new options added with that
[04:46:59] <Cork> systemfault: there will be
[04:47:11] <Cork> just like there was a html5 spec
[04:47:29] <systemfault> Cork: Depends for who...
[04:47:35] <Cork> systemfault: marketing
[04:47:39] <systemfault> The w3c likes numbers...
[04:47:44] <Cork> ya
[04:47:46] <systemfault> The whatwg think differently.
[04:47:49] <dblosevn> like gradients for isntance in firefox, there completely different then every other browser
[04:48:00] <Cork> dblosevn: no, its not
[04:48:06] <dblosevn> they trying to go all microsoft on us and create there own spec
[04:48:12] <Cork> dblosevn: there was three specs
[04:48:30] <Cork> and modern webkit and modern gecko both use the same spec
[04:48:34] <dblosevn> i could actually read the webkit gradient code, that moz crap gave me a headache
[04:49:21] <dblosevn> i just glanced at it and understood the webkit version, i spent like 2 hours trying to achieve the same effect in moz
[04:49:33] <Cork> dblosevn: you honnestly liked -webkit-gradient(linear, from(.2, #101010), color-stop(.5, blue), to(1, black)) ?!?
[04:49:51] <dblosevn> no thats closer the the crap i didnt like in moz
[04:50:00] <Cork> no that is the webkit spec
[04:50:48] <Cork> mozilla was -moz-linear-gradient(top left, bottom left, 10% red, 50% blue, 100% black)
[04:51:23] <dblosevn> maybe i was using an older version of the syntax for moz then
[04:51:31] <Cork> the new spec is linear-gradient(from top, 10% red, 50% blue, 100% black) if i remember correctly
[04:51:34] <dblosevn> because the webkit stuff was like -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgb(222,71,38) 38%, rgb(255,100,65) 69%);
[04:51:45] <Cork> dblosevn: that is the mozilla spec
[04:52:00] <Cork> webkit implemented it too
[04:52:03] <dblosevn> and for moz it was stop this and stop that lol
[04:52:08] <Cork> no
[04:52:15] <Cork> your mixing it up
[04:53:38] <dblosevn> well, is chromes webkit different then safari's because i got it to work in like 10 minutes in safari
[04:53:56] <Cork> ya, but what you explained is the second spec
[04:54:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, got a form with over 40 fields that need to be passed in an ajax call to a php script
[04:54:04] <Cork> both mozilla and webkit supports it
[04:54:14] <Cork> and mozilla was the one that suggested it
[04:54:18] <dblosevn> been bout a year and a half since i did it, i might just be tired too lol
[04:54:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there a way to retrieve all data at once instead of getting each form field value separate?
[04:54:37] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: myForm.serialize() ?
[04:54:40] <Cork> dblosevn: read up on its messy history https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/linear-gradient
[04:55:01] <Cork> opps
[04:55:08] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/linear-gradient#History_of_the_syntax
[04:55:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can it be unserialized in php?
[04:55:40] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes
[04:55:56] <Cork> you would have to scope the code before you submit it though
[04:56:06] <dblosevn> -moz-linear-gradient([ [ [top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? <color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+); thats what i rememebr
[04:56:15] <seutje> the angle bit always throws me off
[04:56:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> scope the code?
[04:56:39] <Cork> dblosevn: that translates to -moz-linear-gradient(top, 10% blue, 100% black)
[04:56:54] <Cork> dblosevn: and was exactly what you posted with the webkit prefix before
[04:57:08] <dblosevn> and i did something like this in safari -webkit-gradient(<type>, <point> [, <radius>]?, <point> [, <radius>]? [, <stop>]*)
[04:57:12] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: serailize will grab the name of the forms and generate a param string from it
[04:57:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: if I use a POST ajax call, can I then just access the values with $_POST['aa'];
[04:57:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[04:57:36] <Cork> dblosevn: and that is -webkit-gradient(linear, from(.2, #101010), color-stop(.5, blue), to(1, black))
[04:57:44] <Cork> so you really prefered that??
[04:58:06] <dblosevn> one of the grades was super complicated though hired a designer for it
[04:58:17] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes, but if you have the same columns in two forms you will have overwrites
[04:58:35] <dblosevn> let me see if its still live
[04:58:39] <Cork> dblosevn: also the old webkit gradient could do less things then the mozilla one could
[04:58:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have this: sourceparams.values = $('sources').serialize(); and then data	:	sourceparams in the ajax call
[04:59:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how will I access "values" in php?
[04:59:06] <dblosevn> -webkit-gradient(linear, 0 0, 0 100%, from(white), to(#cecece));
[04:59:21] <Cork> thats a really simple gradient
[04:59:46] <dblosevn> ya, im looking for the multicolor one
[04:59:52] <Cork> linear-gradient(top, white, #cecece); does the same
[05:00:14] <dblosevn> background-image: -webkit-gradient(radial, 50% 50%, 40, 50% 50%, 350, from(#1381ca), to(#0c5789));
[05:00:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> With this in php: echo $_POST["values"]["tb_source1"]; - it says illegal string offset
[05:00:39] <Cork> ugg i don't have radical syntax in my head
[05:00:44] <Cork> ised it way to little
[05:01:05] <seutje> for linears u can just linear-gradient(#F00, #BADA55 49%, #F00 50%, #00F)
[05:01:14] <dblosevn> damn i was backwards
[05:01:22] <dblosevn> firefox was the easy one
[05:01:29] <dblosevn> -moz-linear-gradient(-45deg, #568eb4 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, #568eb4 50%, #568eb4 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);
[05:01:30] <Cork> ya, i thought so...
[05:01:39] <Cork> webkits one was weird so...
[05:01:44] <seutje> wasn't FF angle like 0deg = east
[05:01:58] <dblosevn> vs -webkit-gradient(linear, 0 0%, 100% 100%,		color-stop(0.35, transparent),		color-stop(0.35, #568eb4),		color-stop(0.50, #568eb4),		color-stop(0.50, transparent),		color-stop(0.85, transparent),		color-stop(0.85, #568eb4));
[05:02:03] <Cork> seutje: yes
[05:02:07] <Cork> think it was
[05:02:17] <seutje> untill like ff 16 or some arbitrary version
[05:02:25] <seutje> keeps tripping me up
[05:02:32] <seutje> SASS to the rescue!
[05:02:32] <dblosevn> for that swooch down at the bottom http://mpa.grigiometro.com/
[05:02:39] <seutje> or rather, compass
[05:02:43] <Cork> seutje: ya, the finale spec landed in 16
[05:03:03] <seutje> @include background-image(linear-gradient($button1, $button2 49%, $button3 50%, $button4)); // DONE
[05:04:23] <dblosevn> looks way better on a mobile device then it does @ 1920x1080 lol
[05:05:14] <seutje> showoff
[05:05:18] <Cork> dblosevn: i've had a few radial gradients i had to use svg in webkit cause it couldn't do it with its old systax :)
[05:05:37] <seutje> heh
[05:05:42] <chilversc_> with jquery mobile, is there anyway to test if pagecreate has already happened? or delay page create until the main app script is loaded?
[05:05:57] <Cork> dblosevn: btw, i didn't finnish my comment about prefixes before
[05:06:02] <dblosevn> ya i paid an  indian 8 dollars to build that lol
[05:06:20] <Cork> dblosevn: the css working group had landed on not using prefixes for experimental implementations anymore
[05:06:30] <seutje> taxes included?
[05:06:40] <Cork> instead they put them behind a user pref (aka. not accessable by websites)
[05:06:48] <dblosevn> ya lol
[05:07:02] <dblosevn> just 2 lines of css i think he got over
[05:08:37] <dblosevn> well thats kind of worse, be even longer before you can begin implementing newer tech
[05:08:53] <Cork> well not worse
[05:09:10] <Cork> as webkit never removes there prefix basically making there prefix the standard
[05:09:35] <Cork> and forced ie, opera and mozilla to implement support for -webkit- prefixes ?!?
[05:09:50] <dblosevn> oh... i thought the standard once they agreed upon it was going to be no prefix
[05:09:57] <Cork> sure
[05:10:13] <Cork> but if 70% of all pages only use -webkit-gradient
[05:10:18] <Cork> what does the spec matters?
[05:10:39] <Cork> (and i mean ONLY -webkit-gradient)
[05:10:48] <Cork> and -webkit-opacity and so on
[05:11:07] <dblosevn> im pretty good about adding support for at the minimum no prefix moz and webkit :-)
[05:11:15] <xec> just out of curiousity, where did you get that 70% figure from?
[05:11:22] <Cork> dblosevn: ya, desktop is ok, but mobile is horrible
[05:11:22] <pallet> Hi all, can anyone tell me why http://pastebin.com/ANqu1QfG doesn't work in Safari ?
[05:11:27] <chilversc_> is there a function I can call in jquery mobile to test if pagecreated has already fired?
[05:11:27] <dblosevn> i never include support for opera being i dont think ive ever met anybody that used it
[05:11:31] <Cork> xec: out of a dark place
[05:11:37] <chilversc_> or anyway I can delay pagecreated until I'm ready?
[05:11:37] <Cork> but its a silly high number
[05:11:39] <Cork> :)
[05:12:03] <xec> Cork: and is that out of all webpages, or all webpages that use gradients
[05:12:03] <systemfault> dblosevn: Soon, it will be even more useles to test opera...
[05:12:05] <Cork> mobile web is almost exclusively webkit now days
[05:12:17] <Cork> xec: the gradient was an example
[05:12:21] <systemfault> dblosevn: As opera will be a customized copy of chrome
[05:12:33] <Cork> but mobile pages very often only use -webkit-<something>
[05:12:35] <dblosevn> :-D nowi  migh try opera out lol
[05:13:01] <Cork> xec: and thats to quite a degree cause apples documentations always point them to the prefixed attribute
[05:13:10] <systemfault> dblosevn: It's not done yet… but soon
[05:13:14] <Cork> even for things thats been standardized for ages
[05:13:24] <dblosevn> im trying to build a hella lightweight browser, based on chrome, i literally dont need anything but a scriptable browser window
[05:13:44] <[jasper]> hej guys, I want to add an eventemitter to my code
[05:13:47] <[jasper]> is there any native solution?
[05:13:54] <dblosevn> i was hoping that google being open lik it is would have a com component but nooo they dont
[05:14:21] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn Chromium Embedded Framework?
[05:14:42] <Cork> ?g uzbl @ dblosevn
[05:14:42] <b-ot> dblosevn: Sorry, no results for ‟uzbl @ dblosevn”.
[05:14:43] <dblosevn> i tried like 4 different ports of that and none of them render like chrome does
[05:14:44] <xec> Cork: sneaky bastards
[05:14:44] <bot-t> dblosevn, Uzbl - web interface tools which adhere to the unix philosophy. - http://uzbl.org/
[05:15:24] <dblosevn> the chrome auto updater keeps breaking my app
[05:15:28] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn, four different ports? Which ones?
[05:15:32] <Cork> xec: ya, and when the standard committee asked "when will you removed your old prefixes", they answered "never"
[05:15:56] <dblosevn> god let me look, i rmember asomeium or something like that for sure
[05:16:13] <dblosevn> awesomium
[05:16:14] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn ahh awesomium
[05:16:15] <Cork> xec: and this prefix business was finnaly what killed presto
[05:16:47] <Cork> (if you've missed it, opera is just a skinned chromium now days)
[05:16:56] <dblosevn> dont rememebr the others, i couldnt find a noarch build of that though, although i liked it a lot
[05:16:57] <chilversc_> where's the jquery mobile docs for its configuration options?
[05:17:01] <xec> yeah i know, sad times
[05:17:28] <chilversc_> I'm looking at api.jquerymobile.com and I can't see anything about configuration options?
[05:17:29] <Cork> xec: especially as opera fought so hard for the specs
[05:17:47] <ankr> Which one is more correct? $.fn.extend or $.fn.myFunc ?
[05:17:57] <dblosevn> i need the app to install on both x86 an dx64 and i couldnt pull it off with awesomium being there binarys are x64
[05:18:04] <Cork> ankr: the first one if you want to add more then one
[05:18:12] <Cork> ankr: the second one if you want to add just one
[05:18:16] <ankr> Cork, but beside that?
[05:18:30] <Cork> both works just as well beside that
[05:18:47] <Cork> there isn't really a right or wrong there
[05:18:59] <Cork> $.fn.extend makes the code more readable
[05:19:02] <dblosevn> chrome updated the touch api a few months ago in prep for windows 8 and totally broke my app, well at least the flash stuff
[05:19:03] <ankr> Cork, that's all I wanted to hear :) - Thanks a lot!
[05:19:03] <Cork> but thats about it
[05:19:58] <dblosevn> and i cant get the flas to try to fix them to work, so im stuck with breaking the updater
[05:20:53] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn did you run the app from chrome (standard browser), CEF or something else?
[05:21:19] <dblosevn> chrome
[05:21:27] <dblosevn> it was developed for chrome
[05:21:55] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn okay bad luck there
[05:22:00] <dblosevn> but one component we borrowed from there corporate site, and there developers refuse to give up the source
[05:23:03] <BillyJoe_> Then it sounds like you got yourself covered in a sense. That guy should fix it.
[05:23:15] <dblosevn> ya its like pulling teeth
[05:23:21] <Cork> for a cost most likely
[05:23:41] <xec> dblosevn: their*
[05:23:43] <Cork> ppl that won't give up the source normally count of income from forcing the customer to come back
[05:23:46] <BillyJoe_> dblosevn how does titanium compare? Is that similar to CEF or another approach?
[05:23:59] <dblosevn> they dont really care because that department doesnt really need the functionality, as nobody vists cat.com from a touch screen
[05:25:03] <dblosevn> where everybody that uses my app uses a touch screen, so im sol either build a new solution which they really dont want to pay for or come up with a workaround to keep chrome from breaking my touch events lol
[05:25:41] <pallet> why would  $("#option-2").show(); not work in Safari ?
[05:25:58] <dblosevn> the developers that wrote the code work fro the same company im subbing for lol
[05:26:29] <pallet> Anyone ?
[05:26:40] <dblosevn> pallet: either your not doing that in dom ready or you have another #option-2 on the page or, your code is busted above it
[05:29:55] <pallet> dblosevn, it's only doing it in Safari, it is inside a ready and there's not another #option-2 and there's NO code above it
[05:30:18] <Cork> pallet: what kind of element is #option-2?
[05:30:25] <pallet> dblosevn, http://www.d-techshop.com/library-security/DT-1001-1 click on the checkbox that says yes
[05:30:29] <pallet> it's a div
[05:30:53] <pallet> works in all other browsewrs
[05:31:54] <Cork> pallet: there is no yes checkbox...
[05:32:11] <Cork> ah, your redirecting
[05:33:02] <chilversc_> well that's a bit convoluted, but apparently I have to load jquery only, hook the mobileinit event, set $.mobile.autoInitalizePage = false; then load jquery mobile, then later call $.mobile.initializePage() when I'm ready; none of which is documented anywhere :s
[05:33:34] <dblosevn> my machien is broken so i dont have safari :-(
[05:33:50] <dblosevn> *machine
[05:34:11] <dblosevn> dell needs to tighten up and send me my replacement
[05:35:15] <dblosevn> i dont even see a checkbox lol
[05:35:31] <Cork> ya, the url redirects to a commingsoon page
[05:35:35] <pallet> oh
[05:35:37] <pallet> FFS
[05:36:05] <pallet> Sorry back again
[05:36:07] <pallet> try again
[05:36:56] <Cork> pallet: you have two ready in each other
[05:37:02] <zulu-gula> how to add click event, something like toggle, but when it's 1st click it do fn1(), 2nd fn2(), 3rd fn1(), 4th fn4 etc
[05:37:05] <fn> hello, does anyone get experience with jquery supersized plugin? in my way, i want to show a video (html5 or object embed) to show inlined fullscreen, any idea? without/with plugin?
[05:37:14] <Cork> pallet: $(document).ready(function() { $(function() {
[05:37:28] <fn> zulu-gula: count the click events
[05:38:12] <dblosevn> damnit i just rm'd all the files that needed added to my repo...
[05:38:26] <Cork> pallet: also your using ready in the body, that has undependable behaviors
[05:40:59] <kryl> is it possible to fetch the content of an external page and show it in a popup ? I want to get it from the server IP and not directly from the client.
[05:41:22] <Cork> kryl: not if the server is another domain then the one your page is from
[05:41:31] <chilversc_> does this seem reasonable for initializing jquery mobile with requirejs? https://gist.github.com/chilversc/5082299
[05:41:43] <Cork> kryl: unless that server supports jsonp that is
[05:41:59] <pallet> If I unrem that alert it shows the alert
[05:42:13] <pallet> so the function is running, so I'm a little baffled
[05:42:18] <chilversc_> it works fine, its just that I can't find any documentation for events, methods or settings I'm using
[05:43:43] <t432> Anybody used the backbone.js framework or eqvivalent for any web projects?
[05:44:29] <kryl> Cork, ok and to continue the navigation in this popup through this process and not direclty from the client browser is there any solution ?
[05:44:47] <kryl> Cork, I think there is simply way to make such a proxy.
[05:44:51] <Cork> kryl: iframe
[05:45:34] <kryl> the goal is just to make a web proxy
[05:46:04] <Cork> well you could do it with a solution like that
[05:46:24] <Cork> as long as the servers has a special api to support it
[05:46:42] <Cork> or if your routing it over the server your loading the page from
[05:47:12] <kryl> ok
[05:48:39] <kryl> may I need to parse all the links to be sure to continue the navigation through this process
[05:48:56] <pallet> Cork, if I stick a $("#option-2").css('display','table'); after the show(), then it works all fine and lovely
[05:49:08] <davetarmac> hey guys
[05:49:31] <Cork> pallet: how are you hiding the element by default?
[05:49:51] <davetarmac> I'm having some trouble with getting this to work http://jsfiddle.net/Ry7ef/
[05:50:21] <davetarmac> It needs to be that when you click on Show Info 1 (for instance), then Information Block 1 is shown, and so on for 2 and 3 and 4
[05:50:46] <Cork> davetarmac: you forgot the js
[05:51:21] <davetarmac> Cork: It's there, isn't it? http://jsfiddle.net/Ry7ef/2/
[05:51:44] <Cork> now it is
[05:51:57] <davetarmac> strange - it was there on the first link on mine
[05:52:02] <davetarmac> never mind, it's there now :)
[05:53:32] <dblosevn> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/Ry7ef/3/
[05:54:17] <davetarmac> oh - ok that seems a lot easier than I was trying to make it!
[05:54:23] <davetarmac> thanks a bunch dblosevn
[05:54:26] <pallet> Cork, $('#option-2').hide();
[05:54:37] <dblosevn> np
[05:54:54] <Cork> pallet: and it has the default display of block before that?
[05:54:56] <walidvb> hi guys. this is more of a js related question, but still. I'm using malsup's cycle2 plugin, and i'm trying to know if on initialisation a hash was detected in the browser's location path
[05:55:21] <walidvb> i find this information to be printed by console.log(optionHash) at the right event
[05:55:36] <walidvb> the info i need is in optionHash._hashFence
[05:55:57] <walidvb> however, when I use optionHash._hashFence i get 'undefined'
[05:56:17] <walidvb> i was thinking it might have to do with public/private attribute, if that even exists in js?
[05:56:30] <Cork> walidvb: js don't have public private
[05:56:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come sourceparams.values = $('#sources').serialize(); results in an empty sourceparams.values
[05:56:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[05:56:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> The form exists
[05:56:41] <walidvb> Cork: that's what i thought, too
[05:56:47] <dblosevn> its probally in a different scope or something
[05:56:58] <Cork> walidvb: so are you sure optionHash isn't a filtered object?
[05:57:09] <walidvb> Cork: what is filtered object?
[05:57:25] <Cork> walidvb: plugin.getOptions() or something
[05:57:26] <walidvb> optionHash is a parameter passed to the callback function of an event
[05:57:36] <Cork> and it removes all ._ variables before it returns you the object
[05:57:42] <Cork> its quite common
[05:57:59] <walidvb> hm i'm not sure, but would it print it when i log(optionHash) ?
[05:58:08] <Cork> no
[05:58:14] <walidvb> well, it does :)
[05:58:14] <Cork> if its filtered, its just not there
[05:58:22] <dblosevn> maybe it has an invliad char in it
[05:58:26] <Cork> ok, then your just using the wrong name :)
[05:58:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why is stackoverflow.com listed first on every damn jquery question
[05:58:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> stupid shitsite
[05:58:44] <walidvb> Cork: hmmm.. let me try, again.
[05:58:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't need opinions, need facts
[05:59:05] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: -host:stackoverflow.com ?
[05:59:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah sure, i'll type that crap each time i need to find something
[06:00:09] <walidvb> Cork: http://cl.ly/image/2B40471v3E1N
[06:00:15] <walidvb> and nope, i still get undefined
[06:00:46] <Cork> walidvb: do you have a link?
[06:00:52] <Cork> images is a bit hard to debug
[06:01:00] <walidvb> the preceding _ is a normal character, right?
[06:01:09] <granden> Hi, anyone who uses bigVideo.JS? I cant figure out the correct way to make a play/pause button for it.
[06:01:09] <Cork> might be
[06:01:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: can you help me?
[06:01:14] <walidvb> Cork: unfortunately I have no link ftm..
[06:01:21] <walidvb> Cork: site is still private
[06:01:31] <walidvb> i could however open it up for a minute
[06:01:41] <Cork> walidvb: an option is to do console.log(Object.keys(optionHash))
[06:01:42] <walidvb> but really for a minute, if client finds out ;)
[06:01:49] <Cork> walidvb: then check the string it lists as keys
[06:01:55] <Cork> might be they have a space in it or something
[06:01:57] <walidvb> oh, nice
[06:02:06] <Cork> then use that string as optionHash[string]
[06:02:18] <walidvb> rather than optionHash.string
[06:02:20] <walidvb> ?
[06:02:26] <walidvb> is . and [] the same?
[06:02:42] <Cork> walidvb: optionHash.something vs optionHash['something']
[06:02:50] <walidvb> exactly. ok
[06:02:51] <Cork> walidvb: yes, except [] can have spaces in the key
[06:02:55] <Cork> walidvb: optionHash.something vs optionHash['s o m e t h ing']
[06:03:03] <walidvb> so only syntax is different. nice i didn't know that.
[06:03:05] <walidvb> thanks
[06:03:08] <walidvb> i'll let you know
[06:04:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: made a pastie with all details if you have a min to look
[06:04:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastie.org/6379890
[06:05:20] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: and #sources sounds like it matches multiple forms, does it?
[06:05:30] <dblosevn> ya thats what i was thinking to Cork
[06:05:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no, only one form
[06:05:42] <dblosevn> damn phone rang before i could type it though lol
[06:07:34] <dblosevn> or maybe its one of thoughs weird _ from ms word or something lol
[06:08:02] <walidvb> Cork: i'm reading through the list again, but it seems that attribute is not in the keys....
[06:08:32] <dblosevn> that would effectively make it undefined
[06:09:05] <walidvb> Cork: http://cl.ly/image/121O2E1X3b3J (sorry about the image again).
[06:09:07] <walidvb> is that possible?
[06:09:52] <sethetter> I'm using bootstrap and I have a page that has the same dropdown menu in the navbar as another page but on one of them clicking the button to show the dropdown just focuses the button and doesn't show the dropdown. It behaves correctly on the other page.
[06:10:00] <dblosevn> walidvb: is there a hash on the page? if theres not it may not add the item to the object
[06:10:27] <walidvb> well hashFence is either true or false, according to hashPresent or not
[06:10:30] <sethetter> I've been looking for major differences between the two pages for awhile now and I'm not seeing anything. It seems like the click event for that button is messed up or being hijacked somewhere but I'm not sure how to trace it.
[06:11:06] <sethetter> Using $(".dropdown-toggle").dropdown("toggle"); works correctly and displays the dropdown, but trying to tie that piece of code to a click handler on the button fails.
[06:18:08] <walidvb> Cork: dblosevn any other clue?
[06:25:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is this a valid selector? $("#sources :input[id^=tb_source]")
[06:27:33] <shoky> yes
[06:27:59] <shoky> though you should use a class instead ..
[06:28:42] <seutje> why the colon?
[06:28:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it acceptable to use a css class that does not exist?
[06:28:51] <seutje> sure
[06:29:08] <seutje> u mean like $('.i-dont-exist')?
[06:30:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah
[06:30:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no
[06:30:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i mean if it doesn't exist in css
[06:31:03] <shoky> yes
[06:31:24] <NoWired> ecky--ptang-zoob, only have to exist in css if you want to make something with it
[06:38:42] <prawnsalad> hey guys. i have $collection = $('.some-class') that contains multiple elements, while i have one of those elements also in $el. how can i remove $el from $collection?
[06:39:33] <pachet> prawnsalad: $('.some-class').not($el)
[06:40:12] <prawnsalad> that simple huh..
[06:41:48] <prawnsalad> so it is. cheers pachet :)
[06:42:38] <pachet> :]
[06:43:59] <jonjo> hello, I am using jquery .load function as a page handler and making it load some carousel items as shown here http://pastie.org/6380118
[06:44:20] <jonjo> after it has loaded the page how can I count how many carousel div's have loaded?
[06:44:37] <walidvb> Cork: so, no clue then?
[06:44:41] <walidvb> ^^
[06:44:45] <Cork> walidvb: sorry?
[06:44:50] <Cork> i've been away for a while
[06:44:54] <jonjo> the code in var Register = function() does not work on the loaded html
[06:44:54] <walidvb> no prob :)
[06:45:19] <walidvb> the Object.key(options) doesn't show that key... but log(options) does...
[06:45:26] <walidvb> http://cl.ly/image/121O2E1X3b3J
[06:46:41] <Cork> walidvb: i don't have a good answer to that one actually
[06:46:45] <Cork> sorry
[06:46:58] <walidvb> Cork: easy, thanks for your help anyways!
[06:47:02] <walidvb> weird one, though!
[06:47:04] <Cork> np
[06:47:30] <Cork> walidvb: i suspect that its something with how chrome shows it
[06:47:50] <walidvb> safari, but webkit, yes
[06:47:50] <walidvb> ok
[06:47:51] <Cork> just for fun what do you find on object.prototype ?
[06:47:55] <walidvb> i'll try on ff
[06:47:57] <pachet> walidvb: what key is it?
[06:47:58] <pachet> joined late
[06:48:18] <Cork> pachet: _hashFence
[06:48:24] <walidvb> hm i have an callback argument given by cycle2
[06:49:35] <walidvb> 				console.log("proto:", optionHash.prototype);
[06:49:38] <walidvb> undefined
[06:49:52] <Cork> sigh
[06:49:56] <walidvb> pachet: and i'm trying to access one of its attribute, _hashFence
[06:50:39] <Cork> walidvb: i could prob locate it if i had access to the code, but remote like this; no i'm out of ideas
[06:50:56] <pachet> yeah, the only things i can think of that would cause that not to show up in .keys is if the property was inherited (as Cork was thinking)
[06:51:08] <pachet> or if it was specifically created as non-enumerable
[06:51:10] <walidvb> i can see it when i log(optionHash), but i can't access optionHash._hashFence and it doesn't show in object.key(optionHash)
[06:51:26] <Cork> well if you generate it with enumerable false that would give that effect too
[06:51:34] <Cork> but you would still be able to access it
[06:51:35] <walidvb> Cork: would it help if I made the site public for a few minutes?
[06:51:48] <Cork> walidvb: i don't have time right now, so no
[06:51:55] <walidvb> Cork: fair enough :D
[06:52:27] <walidvb> object.prototype is +/- the class definition of the object?
[06:52:50] <pachet> em, not exactly
[06:53:22] <pachet> its an object that's used to provide a list of fallback properties for other objects
[06:53:28] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; Object.defineProperty(a, 'num', { value: 2, enumerable: false, writable: false }); print(Object.keys(a)); print(a.num);
[06:53:31] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: Object.defineProperty is not a function
[06:53:48] <Cork> uh...
[06:53:52] <walidvb> lol
[06:53:58] <Cork> js> ?eval var a = {}; Object.defineProperty(a, 'num', { value: 2, enumerable: false, writable: false }); print(Object.keys(a)); print(a.num);
[06:53:59] <walidvb> i get the point, though
[06:54:00] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:54:06] <pachet> lol
[06:54:09] <Cork> opps
[06:54:12] <Cork> js> var a = {}; Object.defineProperty(a, 'num', { value: 2, enumerable: false, writable: false }); print(Object.keys(a)); print(a.num);
[06:54:14] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:54:18] <Cork> stupid bots
[06:54:31] <shoky> walidvb: what event is this?
[06:54:45] <walidvb> shoky: cycle-pre-initialize
[06:54:53] <walidvb> malsup's cycle2 plugin
[06:54:54] <pachet> var a = {}; Object.defineProperty(a, 'num', { value: 2, enumerable: false, writable: false }); [Object.keys(a), a.num]
[06:55:08] <pachet> bleh, i cant get it right either
[06:55:10] <pachet> js> var a = {}; Object.defineProperty(a, 'num', { value: 2, enumerable: false, writable: false }); [Object.keys(a), a.num]
[06:55:15] <b-ot> pachet: No output.
[06:55:26] <Cork> pachet: b-ot only supports print()
[06:55:45] <pachet> js> print('this bot sucks')
[06:55:46] <Cork> js> print(Object.defineProperty);
[06:55:48] <b-ot> pachet: this bot sucks
[06:55:53] <b-ot> Cork: undefined
[06:55:55] <Cork> ah
[06:56:19] <pachet> why doesnt that throw an error :[
[06:56:25] <pachet> js> foo()
[06:56:29] <b-ot> pachet: No output.
[06:56:37] <Cork> cause b-ot is a bit lacking on all fronts
[06:56:43] <Cork> bot-t does though
[06:57:14] <pachet> herm
[06:59:05] <walidvb> shoky: you know the issue?
[07:00:41] <shoky> walidvb: probably
[07:01:02] <walidvb> shoky: you know the solution? ;)
[07:01:17] <shoky> walidvb: the property doesn't exist yet when you're logging
[07:01:46] <walidvb> hm. i log both optionHash and object.keys(opthionHash) at the same time
[07:01:47] <shoky> walidvb: when you expand an object in chrome console, it shows a "live" view of the object, kinda
[07:01:57] <shoky> so it shows you this property that is only added afterwards
[07:02:00] <walidvb> shoky: oh.
[07:02:16] <walidvb> that can be, indeed. would kinda make sense, too..
[07:02:18] <shoky> walidvb:  just like here  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VEPzx/1/
[07:02:43] <pachet> walidvb: you can try console.log(JSON.stringify(Object.keys(foo)))
[07:03:17] <walidvb> pachet: i suspect shoky to have found the problem
[07:03:32] <walidvb> what would that change? (i'll try anyways)
[07:03:36] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/fJU4T/1/ - Anyone who can help me with my Play/Pause button, created a jsFiddle.
[07:03:48] <granden> Using bigvideo.js but dont get the button to work.
[07:03:52] <granden> It works if i click it 3 times
[07:04:01] <granden> but dont reacts for the first klick
[07:04:05] <granden> click*
[07:04:37] <pachet> walidvb: oh im sorry, that should be JSON.stringify(foo)
[07:04:44] <pachet> spacing out
[07:04:47] <walidvb> granden: init playing to 0
[07:06:16] <walidvb> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/fJU4T/2/
[07:07:00] <granden> walidvb: Uhm, you sure about that?
[07:07:03] <shoky> walidvb:  i see even (at least in the latest chrome) that when expanding an object, chrome shows a little "i" icon next to the expansion
[07:07:20] <granden> walidvb: Tried it, and still needs two clicks for me
[07:07:24] <shoky> walidvb: and when you hover over it, it says: "Object state below is captured upon first expansion"
[07:07:34] <walidvb> granden: hm lemme try again, maybe i went too fast
[07:07:50] <walidvb> shoky: i'm on safari but let's check
[07:07:55] <shoky> ah right
[07:07:56] <granden> Yeah think so. Because if it is 0 it should run the else and that one got a play.
[07:08:11] <shoky> anyway this is the first time im noticing that icon
[07:08:21] <shoky> so its possibly new
[07:08:29] <walidvb> safari has nothing
[07:08:29] <shoky> (and im on chrome beta)
[07:10:07] <granden> walidvb: Did you find anything else?
[07:11:22] <walidvb> granden: on it
[07:11:36] <walidvb> it's supposed to be playing at first, correct?
[07:12:59] <shoky> walidvb ye i see it was added to webkit about a week ago ;]
[07:13:16] <walidvb> (y) update needed then :)
[07:13:43] <granden> walidvb: Yes it is.
[07:14:32] <shoky> oops jan 25 was not a week ago, silly me.
[07:14:40] <shoky> month+week :\
[07:18:02] <walidvb> granden: weird indeed...
[07:18:41] <granden> Yeah, dont really get it, why it does not work. Tried contacting the developer of the script as well. Will have to wait and see about that though.
[07:19:30] <walidvb> granden: still, small optimisation: http://jsfiddle.net/fJU4T/5/
[07:19:30] <granden> walidvb: Strange thing is. On the developers test-page he got a checkbox with the id video-toggle and then this javascript, $('#video-toggle').on('click', function(e) {
[07:19:33] <granden>                 if (this.checked)   BV.getPlayer().play();
[07:19:35] <granden>                 else                BV.getPlayer().pause();
[07:19:38] <granden>             })
[07:19:44] <granden> and that works correctly.
[07:20:19] <walidvb> yes, it does seem like pause is called, but somehow not applied on the first time.
[07:21:52] <granden> Yeah, that is really strange
[07:22:51] <walidvb> granden: it does detect that the player is playing, too...
[07:22:52] <jonjo> how can I make $('.carousel-register-content').load('html/page/registration/' + page_name + '.html'); work with preloaded jquery
[07:22:55] <amcsi_work> hi
[07:23:45] <granden> walidvb: Yeah I know. dont get it :)
[07:24:20] <walidvb> granden: well.. good luck with that. you did see about the player.paused() method though. avoids using a playing var that could be wrong
[07:24:34] <amcsi_work> when subscribing to onbeforeunload, how do I find out whether the unload is due to a specific link on the page, or anything else (including another link or closing of the browser)?
[07:24:48] <granden> walidvb: Yeah did notice it. Thanks
[07:24:53] <walidvb> and you do know that all the css you do via js can be done via css directly, too
[07:24:54] <granden> But I just thought of another thing
[07:25:23] <granden> style a checkbox like a button. And then use his play/pause js-function. :)
[07:25:26] <granden> Going to try that.
[07:25:43] <shoky> granden:  play() gets called all the time
[07:25:44] <walidvb> granden: what difference will it make?'
[07:25:53] <shoky> it's pausing but then play() is called for some reason
[07:25:53] <granden> shoky: Yeah, but why? :)
[07:26:03] <shoky> Hm.
[07:26:18] <granden> walidvb: Dont know, but then I at least done exactly as he did. :)
[07:26:28] <shoky> granden: how long is the video
[07:26:34] <walidvb> shoky: well after 2-3 clicks it behaves normally.
[07:26:40] <shoky> play() gets called because of an "ended" event
[07:27:15] <shoky> hrm.
[07:27:24] <granden> shoky: It is about 2minutes or so I belive
[07:27:29] <shoky> no its a few seconds
[07:27:42] <shoky> 5 ;]
[07:27:52] <granden> shoky: No the video, thats not just a few seconds.
[07:27:59] <granden> oh that video.
[07:28:04] <granden> woops did use a test video on that
[07:28:05] <walidvb> yes 5 secs
[07:28:24] <granden> woops, could throw in my original video.
[07:28:30] <granden> that is a few minutes
[07:28:35] <granden> but got the same problem.
[07:28:59] <gotwig> my on event listeners with click dont work on iPad!!
[07:29:02] <gotwig> help
[07:30:46] <granden> Haha noticed another strange thing though. If I press on the video and then on play/pause button
[07:30:50] <granden> it will pause imadiatley
[07:31:46] <granden> OMG, did a checkbox styled as a button.
[07:31:55] <granden> And that one works outo f the box
[07:31:57] <granden> no problems at all.
[07:32:18] <walidvb> granden: well done
[07:32:21] <walidvb> there you go
[07:32:25] <walidvb> still very weird
[07:32:28] <granden> walidvb: But it is just strange
[07:32:45] <walidvb> you should send the fiddle to the devs
[07:33:22] <granden> I did
[07:34:30] <jonjo> I am loading a html file into a div using $('.content').load('hello.html'); after it has loaded how can I count how many div's it has added?
[07:35:47] <NoiseEee> jonjo: hmmm, sounds like the would certainly be a wack of invalid html
[07:35:49] <NoiseEee> html in html
[07:36:53] <granden> walidvb: You said something about my javascript setting css could be done with pure css. how would I seett it to the viewport height etc if I dont know the height?
[07:37:19] <granden> height:100% ; is not working as expectod most times?
[07:37:35] <walidvb> for the height it's slightly more complicated, but you can have a div have top: 0 and bottom: 0, and it will have the viewport's height
[07:38:57] <walidvb> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/U8HzN/
[07:39:49] <walidvb> granden: and width:100%; usually works fine
[07:40:24] <mg983> Hi all, strange occurance… hoping someone can help me.  http://native.matgargano.com/ if you use FF the top menus (home / info / coffee / vendors / blog) does what is expected (scrolls down to the div with the ID of the hashbang… if you use Chrome it doesn't work. Anyone have any idea what is causing that?
[07:43:09] <pachet> jonjo: var $content = $('.content'); $content.load('whatever', function () { console.log($('div', $content).length); })
[07:43:20] <gotwig> FUCKING iPADS!!!
[07:43:30] <gotwig> I dont want extra code for iPads and apple shit
[07:43:32] <gotwig> RAAAWWR
[07:43:43] <pachet> i like how you left that lowercase i out of deference
[07:43:44] <granden> walidvb: nice, thnks :)
[07:43:46] <pachet> despite your obvious rage
[07:44:12] <pachet> gotwig: retina troubles?
[07:44:43] <gotwig> pachet: no, event handlers dont work
[07:45:04] <gotwig> ....
[07:45:22] <gotwig> I dont want to include extra divs on my event handler things...
[07:45:25] <gotwig> that I reference
[07:45:30] <gotwig> or include all scripts in the body area
[07:45:35] <gotwig> ...
[07:45:49] <gotwig> I actually liked safari in the past, now i am fucking depressed
[07:47:12] <shoky> mg983: it's because of the overflow-x: hidden
[07:47:39] <shoky> mg983:  seperate setting for overflow-x and overflow-y is not really supported in most browsers
[07:47:50] <shoky> mg983: so its as if you did overflow:hidden
[07:48:11] <jonjo> thanks pachet
[07:48:43] <pachet> yw
[07:50:05] <mg983> shoky: on what element?
[07:50:16] <shoky> mg983: mm or at least i remember a while ago it wasn't supported. not sure what the issue is exactly, but removing the overflow-x:hidden makes it work
[07:50:22] <shoky> mg983:  html/body
[07:50:47] <Gho5t> does .load() work with an iframe in IE 9?
[07:50:52] <Gho5t> I'm not seeming to have any luck
[07:51:07] <mg983> thanks shoky
[07:51:26] <pachet> shoky: yeah as far as i know its still broken in latest firefox :[
[07:51:29] <pachet> kind of sucks
[07:51:40] <shoky> hmpf
[07:51:44] <pachet> i'd love to be able to overflow:x hidden overflow:y auto
[07:51:47] <pachet> would be a golden day
[07:51:53] <shoky> aye
[07:52:32] <didiergm> gotwig despite the urge don't throw it through the window - care to show us some code ?
[07:52:48] <gotwig> didiergm: www.bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project
[07:53:48] <didiergm> gotwig: ok what should work and does not ?
[07:54:10] <gotwig> didiergm: all event handlers on li boxes dont work
[07:54:15] <gotwig> new box event handlers work fine
[07:56:04] <didiergm> gotwig: sorry to be thick mate when going to that page I see a nice bacground image and a menu can be discovered  do I need to login / create an account never been on that site before
[07:56:25] <mpavel> pachet: do you mean this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/xKVPS/
[07:57:00] <gotwig> didiergm: oh... sry
[07:57:12] <gotwig> didiergm: Wait 2 mins, I put some stuff in the *unlogged* area
[07:57:19] <didiergm> kk
[07:57:54] <Gho5t> anyone have any luck hooking into ie 9's load event for an iframe
[07:58:41] <ezio> is there an event for validate that fires when the form is valid?
[07:59:03] <didiergm> gho5t have been using $(document).ready scripts on iframes in ie8 & 9 with no probs
[07:59:41] <pachet> mpavel: you're right, i meant s/auto/visible
[07:59:43] <Gho5t> thing is I'm loading pdfs
[07:59:43] <pachet> eg http://jsfiddle.net/V8Ngw/
[07:59:57] <Gho5t> I could try the ready() event
[07:59:59] <gotwig> didiergm: now
[07:59:59] <didiergm> ezio: define 'valid' .... I guess it depends on how you validate your form
[08:00:09] <Gho5t> but I read that's not for when the iframe's content actually loads
[08:00:17] <gotwig> didiergm: meaning clicking images does not work, just like clicking making text bigger, smaller or bold
[08:00:31] <ezio> didiergm, where did you find that?
[08:01:03] <didiergm> gotwig I am trying on chrome and it does not work either
[08:01:07] <t432> has anyboyd played with twitter flight?
[08:01:13] <t432> anybody*
[08:01:23] <didiergm> gotwig so I guess it is not a apple specific stuff
[08:02:00] <ezio> didiergm, ahh found it
[08:02:12] <didiergm> gotwig in the console I have got a "uncaught reference error line 152 savebox
[08:02:34] <mpavel> pachet: ha! that's very interesting
[08:03:56] <didiergm> gotwig: that's a weirdo I don't get it on every click ... sometimes difficult to say when exactly w/o spending much more time
[08:04:41] <didiergm> GhoSt : i really never had issues with timing & stuff.
[08:04:55] <gotwig> didiergm: what?
[08:04:59] <walidvb> i'm off. thanks shoky, pachet and Cork!
[08:05:09] <pachet> np, seeya
[08:05:13] <gotwig> didiergm: that save thing is not a problem..
[08:05:15] <didiergm> GhoSt that said if you load a pdf, that might be different as I guess you are not loading a full html + js page
[08:05:18] <gotwig> it still should work
[08:05:57] <didiergm> gotwig: when I click on any box or image on chrome nothing happens; only when I click on + - or X
[08:06:22] <gotwig> didiergm: you have to be logged in for a click on image.. sry
[08:06:31] <didiergm> gotwig : click on the image sometimes give me that uncaught reference error - so I guess
[08:06:43] <didiergm> gotwig how to I log in ?
[08:06:44] <gotwig> didiergm: but the bigger and smaller and bold functions should work
[08:06:47] <doolinkr> Is there any way I can access an uploaded file immediately without submitting the form.
[08:06:50] <gotwig> didiergm: with panel..?
[08:06:52] <doolinkr> I mean, the file contents.
[08:06:59] <mg983> shoky: thx
[08:07:06] <gotwig> didiergm: click on open menu
[08:07:11] <gotwig> didiergm: then enter tom / rickrolls
[08:07:16] <didiergm> gotwig lemme try on my ipad to see if +/-/X work, 2 mins
[08:07:30] <gotwig> didiergm: it doesnt work ;) I got an Ipad as well
[08:07:39] <scr4ve> Hey folks. I'm currently using the jQuery.ajax converters - may anyone explain to me why I always need to specify "text custom" although the resource is served as application/custom?
[08:08:03] <gotwig> guys on the internet also expirience issues with click events jquery and ipad
[08:08:12] <scr4ve> jQuery doesn't respect the Content-Type header at all unless I specify "* foo" as datatype. Seems odd to me.
[08:08:50] <didiergm> gotwig just wanna see what's diff between chrome/linux & ipad
[08:09:13] <gotwig> didiergm: I try to bind an touchstart event I guess.
[08:09:18] <gotwig> didiergm: I also use linux...
[08:11:04] <scr4ve> here's a minimal (nonworking) testcase for what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/3haW8/
[08:11:09] <didiergm> gotwig on the ipad if I drag a box with an image it does move
[08:11:32] <didiergm> if I tap nothing happens but to be fair on Chhrome nothing happens either
[08:11:48] <gotwig> didiergm: You have to be logged in, dude
[08:11:54] <gotwig> didiergm: I said that before
[08:12:08] <didiergm> I am logged in opn both Ipad & chrome Liux
[08:12:16] <djQuery> does chrome on ipad have remote debugging like it does on android?
[08:12:54] <didiergm> gotwig that's using safari
[08:13:14] <didiergm> gotwig so I repeat my question what do you expect to be able to do that you can't
[08:13:22] <gotwig> didiergm: make text bigger
[08:13:29] <gotwig> didiergm: all actions for LI
[08:13:34] <Pereira> Good evening
[08:13:36] <gotwig> all event listeners dont work
[08:14:33] <didiergm> gotwig ok, I agree does not work; but this is weird has I am gettying a visual feedback of the click on the +
[08:15:31] <Pereira> I'm having some problems, having two dropdowns, the first one filtering the second one. But imagine the case: I change one option in the first drop, then I choose another in the second one. Then I change again a field in the first drop that will filter the values in the second drop to another ones, however, as I've selected an item from a filter that was avaiable before, this wasn't supposed to happen. Any ideas?
[08:15:38] <gotwig> didiergm: Apple makes awesome bad stuff :(
[08:15:59] <gotwig> it works on a nexus 7, a friend told me
[08:16:46] <sebi> mario
[08:17:22] <shoky> scr4ve:  have you looked at the 'contents' option ?
[08:17:25] <didiergm> gotwig don't want to rain on your parade but on samsung / 10.1 note chrome - no go either
[08:17:41] <didiergm> I can move boxes, can't +/- or X
[08:17:59] <gotwig> didiergm: I know....
[08:18:13] <Draeli> hi, I have a little problem. http://jsfiddle.net/9XJyG/ I try to put my div on input field but something wrong happend when the input "move". On first 'toto' trigger, div is done correctly, but after I need to 'toto' interval to have a good position. An idea to correct this problem ?
[08:18:16] <didiergm> I have 4 tablets / smartphones I ipad & 3 android I can test on more
[08:18:17] <gotwig> didiergm: that you can move but cant make bigger and such
[08:18:21] <gotwig> I now just google some more
[08:18:34] <gotwig> didiergm: its ok. I better fix the bug first ;D
[08:18:53] <didiergm> gotwig had a problem with touchstart events before
[08:20:25] <didiergm> gotwig seems to ME (and this is really ME) that the there is a timing difference touchstart / click which confuseds things;
[08:20:45] <gotwig> didiergm: but it doesnt work at all..
[08:20:49] <gotwig> so
[08:20:54] <gotwig> when I add touchstart
[08:20:58] <didiergm> gotwig try with latest jquery 1.9.1
[08:20:58] <gotwig> it doesnt work either
[08:21:02] <gotwig> when I replace click with touchstart
[08:21:14] <gotwig> didiergm: better not, my plugins dont work with 1.9.1
[08:21:20] <gotwig> I dont want to debug even more
[08:21:34] <djQuery> Draeli, you know there are a 100 placeholder plugins out there
[08:21:55] <didiergm> gotwig can't blame you - but it's weird cause there is not a massive diff between 1.9.0 and 1.9.1
[08:22:01] <scr4ve> shoky: Yes. However, contents aren't considered if my first dataType is !== "*"
[08:22:44] <Draeli> djQuery: no plugin what I want to do
[08:23:18] <Draeli> djQuery: and the idea is too to learn how to do by myself
[08:24:54] <scr4ve> shoky: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L715 - contents are skipped if dataType[0] !== "*"
[08:26:30] <didiergm> gotwig: I tried on Firefox/android and same result - so it is not safari/webkit specific
[08:27:29] <gotwig> didiergm: no
[08:27:29] <djQuery> Draeli, instead of doing the window.setInterval you should bind to the window.onresize
[08:27:37] <gotwig> my friend said it works
[08:27:40] <gotwig> :(
[08:27:49] <Soltis> Simple question: if I have var el = ..., then I assume $(el) operates on that element specifically?
[08:28:19] <didiergm> gotwig find a new friend (joking)
[08:28:29] <gotwig> didiergm: u mad?
[08:28:43] <Draeli> djQuery: I can but even if I do, this not correct my problem, setTimeout is only for try my plugin behavior
[08:28:49] <gotwig> didiergm: I dont wanna have friends who got iPads
[08:28:52] <gotwig> ;D
[08:28:55] <gotwig> they make extra work for me
[08:28:58] <gotwig> >.<
[08:29:03] <gotwig> *which
[08:29:24] <Soltis> gotwig: I'd say either phrasing is equally incorrect.
[08:29:41] <gotwig> Soltis: what
[08:30:00] * gotwig is  not a native english speaker
[08:30:22] <Soltis> gotwig: Don't worry, your English is no worse than most native speakers I've encountered.
[08:30:32] <Soltis> gotwig: (Take that as you will.)
[08:30:41] <gotwig> Soltis: and your German is also not bad...
[08:31:28] <gotwig> http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-ipad-code-snippets-plugins/
[08:31:33] <gotwig> u mad...
[08:32:12] <djQuery> Draeli, it takes a 2nd for the label to disapear when typing in it
[08:32:30] <gotwig> All solutions are outdated
[08:32:33] <gotwig> http://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/jquery-click-events-ipad
[08:32:35] <gotwig> .bind is deprecated.. help
[08:32:37] <BillCriswell> Ugh. "jquery ipad code snippets plugins" makes me want to throw up.
[08:32:46] <jonjo> pachet: should this work http://pastie.org/6381386?
[08:32:54] <gotwig> :(!
[08:32:56] <didiergm> gotwig use .on instead
[08:33:07] <gotwig> didiergm: hm, yeah.. maybe
[08:33:52] <didiergm> gotwig: that's the offical advice
[08:34:16] <gotwig> didiergm: Actually when I use .on
[08:34:20] <gotwig> it doesnt work well...
[08:34:23] <gotwig> ?
[08:34:43] <gotwig> when I dont use .on
[08:34:47] <gotwig> it works
[08:35:00] <gotwig> with event listeners, I right now see that in my code. Where I dont use .on it works
[08:35:01] <didiergm> gotwig beware of the two possible syntax of on as on replace both bind/delegate
[08:35:17] <gotwig> e.g 		$(".new_action p").click(function (e) {	
[08:35:19] <gotwig>  works
[08:35:19] <didiergm> gotwig and live
[08:35:21] <gotwig> the same solution with .on doesnt work
[08:35:37] <systemfault> gotwig: that syntax is like .bind
[08:35:39] <tubbo> hey guys, why was .live() removed from the API?
[08:35:49] <didiergm> gotwig: could be a syntax issue see y comment above
[08:35:50] <systemfault> tubbo: because .on does the same thing.
[08:35:53] <tubbo> and does .on() replace it if the element doesn't exist on the page?
[08:36:04] <systemfault> tubbo: The second syntax of it does replace .live
[08:36:11] <gotwig> didiergm: syntax issue? it works on PC, dude
[08:36:12] <tubbo> systemfault: nice. so i can just use .on('click') when previously i'd either have to specify a .click() or a .live()?
[08:36:15] <tubbo> err sorry, a .bind()
[08:36:18] <BillCriswell> tubbo: They heard you really liked it.
[08:36:28] <systemfault> tubbo: $(document).on(eventType, selector, handler) replaces .live
[08:36:29] <gotwig> tubbo: no
[08:36:40] <didiergm> gotwig : hold on the horses syntax of the on itself
[08:36:41] <tubbo> BillCriswell: i really did hate the .live() thing and always wondered why i had to tell jQuery something it already knew/should know :)
[08:36:50] <gotwig> didiergm: my on looks like that.. wait
[08:36:56] <BillCriswell> tubbo: $('.container').on('click', '.item', function(){ // Will fire when .item is clicked on, no matter when it was added... });
[08:37:01] <systemfault> tubbo: So $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { alert('Hello'); });
[08:37:16] <tubbo> systemfault: oh, that's lame
[08:37:23] <gotwig> 			$(document).on("click", ".remove_action", function(e){	
[08:37:28] <BillCriswell> If by lame you mean totally sweet.
[08:37:30] <systemfault> tubbo: Why is it lame?
[08:37:33] <tubbo> so jQuery is still stupid and doesn't know when the element that i'm binding a fn to is available or not huh? ;)
[08:37:51] <shoky> ...
[08:37:55] <systemfault> tubbo: It's the DOM that works that way.. not really jQuery's fault.
[08:38:00] <tubbo> heh, truth
[08:38:27] <tubbo> BillCriswell: does it matter what i put in the initial selector?
[08:38:41] <gotwig> didiergm: whats wrong with that
[08:38:47] <gotwig> didiergm: try to open other .on examples..
[08:38:59] <BillCriswell> tubbo: I like to keep it to a common parent, but you could do document like systemfault said.
[08:39:01] <tubbo> so is $(document).on('click, '.item', function() { .. }); == $('.foo').on('click, '.item', function() { .. });
[08:39:13] <tubbo> BillCriswell: or does it scope my action down to any .item under .foo?
[08:39:33] <didiergm> gotwig: I am not saying wrong; just saying that depending on the sytax & way of attaching the effects are vastrly different since on replaces all manner of ways of attaching events http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:39:49] <BillCriswell> It scopes it. At least I think scopes is the word that describes it.. I'm not very good with terminology.
[08:39:55] <didiergm> gotwig direct / delegated etc ...
[08:40:21] <gotwig> didiergm: there are folks that say I have to place my event handlers in body
[08:40:28] <tubbo> BillCriswell: ah, so that's definitely useful.
[08:40:47] <dblosevn> gotwig: what folks are thoughs, somebody that read a js for dummys book?
[08:40:58] <didiergm> gotwig where are they palced now ? I mean when are you attaching the event ?
[08:41:04] <tubbo> BillCriswell: well what i mean is if i have <div class="foo"><span class="item">click me</span></div>, that will be bound to 'click', but if i just have a random <input class="item"> on the page, it won't be bound.
[08:41:06] <gotwig> didiergm: head area.
[08:41:22] <gotwig> on click
[08:41:35] <didiergm> gotwig: in document.ready ?
[08:41:36] <BillCriswell> tubbo: Yurp.
[08:41:40] <tubbo> however, i'd prefer a syntax like: $('.foo > .item').on('click')
[08:41:41] <gotwig> didiergm: YES
[08:41:42] <dblosevn> gotwig: wrap it in a domready and your good
[08:41:52] <tubbo> and have jQuery determine what to do behind the scenes
[08:41:54] <gotwig> dblosevn: what?
[08:41:55] <shoky> tubbo:  $('.foo').on(...)  will set an event handler on all .foo elements that exist when you execute that line
[08:42:10] <gotwig> dblosevn: do you know my problem?
[08:42:10] <tubbo> shoky: i know, but i don't like that. i think it should be different.
[08:42:12] <dblosevn> unless the nodes are dynamically loaded, youll want to wrap it in another domready after loading the elements
[08:42:21] <shoky> tubbo: well you're wrong ;)
[08:42:22] <gotwig> dblosevn: .on events dont work for me, normal click events work
[08:42:22] <alexr2> I have a problem that's a little hard to explain, but here it goes.  I'm extending a class, lets call it Class1 with another class, Class2.  Each of them has a close() function.  So... $.extend(Class1, Class2)...  I'd like to have Class2's close() function get called first, followed by Class1's close() function...  I assume I need to somehow bind an event to Class2's close() function.  Is there any way to do that?
[08:42:26] <gotwig> without on
[08:42:47] <tubbo> shoky: maybe, but i think you guys are stupid and/or ugly ;)
[08:42:54] <tubbo> </linus-torvalds>
[08:42:54] <gotwig> tubbo: +1
[08:42:55] <BillCriswell> tubbo: I just assume everyone is way smarter than me and if it's done that way there's a pretty good fucking reason.
[08:42:59] <shoky> ;]
[08:43:03] <dblosevn> then your not using on correctly .click is just short hand of .on('click', function
[08:43:20] <dblosevn> but .on is more powerful as it supprots delegation
[08:43:23] <gotwig> dblosevn: when I use click, it works, with on it doesnt.
[08:43:29] <tubbo> i understand "explicit" but i feel like 99% of the time, i don't need to know whether $() is available to the DOM *right* now
[08:43:33] <gotwig> dblosevn: look at my code that I posted here
[08:43:40] <dblosevn> show me a link
[08:43:42] <tubbo> like if $('.item') is on the page, bind the action
[08:43:49] <tubbo> otherwise, wait until it's on the page to bind the action
[08:43:51] <shoky> usually
[08:44:06] <tubbo> but IMHO it's always been bad practice to write events for elements that don't exist
[08:44:11] <shoky> when i code, i want the libs to do what i ask them, when i asked them, and not do any magic for me that will bite me in the ass later
[08:44:13] <tubbo> and just go "oh that didn't exist so the event didn't get fired and oh well"
[08:44:15] <shoky> when i dont expect it
[08:44:20] <gotwig> dblosevn: link to code?
[08:44:22] <systemfault> tubbo: You need to learn about bubbling and event delegation
[08:44:24] <tubbo> shoky: *nod*
[08:44:29] <shoky> just cause something seems useful in one case doesnt make it a good general solution
[08:44:32] <tubbo> systemfault: oh i do, i just think it's annoying personally.
[08:44:38] <systemfault> tubbo: Then you will understand why it works that way.
[08:44:42] <dblosevn> no i want a link to your girls porn site... of course a link to the code...
[08:45:03] <tubbo> systemfault: like, i understand what's going on behind the scenes and "i have no problem with that" ;)
[08:45:17] <tubbo> systemfault: i'm just lazy so i'd like to type less ;)
[08:45:28] <systemfault> tubbo: That's why I usejQuery
[08:45:48] <gotwig> dblosevn: that should be complete: http://pastebin.com/1CwWnTYe
[08:46:01] <BillCriswell> bubbling is interesting. I'd never expect $('div').on('submit') to fire... but it does haah.
[08:46:03] <gotwig> dblosevn: like I said, all normal click events work
[08:47:13] <alexr2> Is there any way to bind events to function calls?  So have it fire off whenever an actual javascript function is called?
[08:47:57] <dblosevn> gotwig: let me see the the markup
[08:58:50] <dblosevn> gotwig: what version of jquery you using
[08:59:12] <tlkr> alexr2, just trigger the event from the function $('div').trigger('event');
[08:59:14] <didiergm> dblosevn he uses 1.9.0
[08:59:53] <dblosevn> weird he never showed my his markup but his code looks right
[09:00:25] <dblosevn> anyways nap time
[09:02:33] <gotwig> dblosevn: not the latest
[09:02:52] <gotwig> dblosevn: help me pls :X!

[09:37:48] <sky> can someone point me to a nice way to manage dynamic form elements, IE adding and removing them, maintaining distinct ID's with the corrent count (ie element1 element 2, delete element 1 and renumber 2 to 1)
[09:38:20] <mads-> Hi. I am making a website where I have some pictures of some people. When the mouse hovers a picture of a person a speech bubble will appear and then mouseout the speech will disappear. However, because the speech bubble appear on top of the person that will mean the mouseout is called. I have the problem reproduced here: http://jsfiddle.net/jrJgq/ - can anyone suggest an idea how I would avoid the stuttering?
[09:38:28] <NoiseEee> vinex08_: add a particular class to particular menu item?
[09:40:24] <vinex08_> i'm using wordpress, i dont wanna create several pages just to set the .selected class on each menu..
[09:41:09] <NoiseEee> maybe you should go to wordpress support
[09:41:33] <vinex08_> tried asking them but no luck..
[09:42:04] <NoiseEee> well maybe you can try paste-binning appropriate code and someone might help
[09:42:12] <vinex08_> i guess its a combination of wordpress/css/jquery
[09:42:20] <NoiseEee> vinex08_: but surely this issue has been handled before.  increase your google-fu
[09:42:33] <eeeeeee7> vines, you're better off doing this in wordpress/php
[09:42:48] <eeeeeee7> i think there is a function just for this
[09:43:13] <vinex08_> yah, i'll do more google
[09:48:24] <Symbi0nt|GER> what is a quick way to have a list of name keys in the dome and rewrite the index of it, so it is 0 to count - 1 again?
[09:49:27] <Symbi0nt|GER> like name="category[0][name]" and having next category[2][name] instead of "1"
[09:51:19] <Gho5t> Is it possible to do something like the following: $('iframe').contents().html($newHtml);
[09:51:48] <eeeeeee7> @ghost: no
[09:52:11] <Gho5t> no way to overwrite an iframe's content?
[09:52:27] <eeeeeee7> change the @src?
[09:52:34] <Gho5t> I'm doing that currently
[09:52:47] <Gho5t> problem is I need to know when the new content is loaded
[09:52:52] <Gho5t> and .load() isn't working in IE 9
[09:52:59] <Soopaman> is it better to handle a recursive pattern using a native function or an object based function?
[09:53:01] <Gho5t> and none of the work-arounds have been working
[09:53:05] <zergion> how do I call a class method from jquery? Am confused over how to initiate $userHandler->delete_id() from a js file
[09:53:22] <Gho5t> so I"m trying to get the data via ajax and replace the iframe's data with that
[09:54:13] <eeeeeee7> is the iframe contents a page you can edit?
[09:54:53] <Gho5t> it's on my domain
[09:54:58] <Gho5t> but it's returning a pdf
[09:55:01] <Gho5t> so that's great
[09:55:19] <eeeeeee7> hm
[09:56:10] <BadPerson> helo frinds
[09:56:12] <BadPerson> o/
[09:56:22] <BadPerson> anyone here know ember js
[09:56:35] <BadPerson> or perhaps knockout
[09:57:04] <shoky> BadPerson: yup (knockout)
[09:57:48] <shoky> Gho5t:  this works in IE9.. not a pdf tho  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gkbN5/6/
[09:58:01] <BadPerson> do you know ember?
[09:58:13] <BadPerson> i thot it was beter than knokout by a shit ton
[09:58:29] <tubbo> trololol https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5083981
[09:58:29] <BadPerson> now im wondering if there is a beter one than ember
[09:58:31] <shoky> they're pretty different things..
[09:58:39] <Gho5t> shoky: yeah I've tried it like that, not sure why it won't work for me
[09:58:45] <tubbo> BadPerson: "better" is a bad way to describe JS frameworks
[09:59:00] <BadPerson> yaya ive heard all this before
[09:59:07] <BadPerson> ok ember it is
[09:59:11] <tubbo> BadPerson: what's your use case? what are you trying to do?
[09:59:39] <BadPerson> its a govt secret
[09:59:46] <tubbo> BadPerson: no it's not, you're using javascript
[09:59:51] <tubbo> the government does not use javascript
[09:59:54] <shoky> BadPerson: knockout does one thing very good (data-binding) and for the rest you can use whatever you want...  ember is a full very-opinionated framework
[10:00:31] <BadPerson> i like their opinion
[10:00:37] * tubbo does too
[10:00:38] <tubbo> =D
[10:00:50] <BadPerson> im kinda not liking the RC factor tho
[10:00:52] <zergion> is it even possible to call a php class method with an ajax request?
[10:01:03] <tubbo> BadPerson: also big plus if you're using Rails as your backend. Ember is very nice when you're using Rails to back it.
[10:01:13] <tubbo> BadPerson: "RC factor"?
[10:01:33] <BadPerson> tubbo i hate ruby
[10:01:34] <tubbo> zergion: if you build an HTTP API for it, sure. but you can't call PHP methods directly with javascript
[10:01:43] <BadPerson> cant i use python or php
[10:01:53] <tubbo> BadPerson: i'm very sorry for you.
[10:02:12] <tubbo> BadPerson: absolutely. i'm just saying that ember and its rubygem, ember-rails, makes it dead simple to work with ember in a rails app
[10:02:41] <BadPerson> ruby is a kid language
[10:02:50] <tubbo> lol
[10:02:54] <tubbo> sure :)
[10:03:32] <garciawebdev> jQuery is a kid library
[10:03:33] <BadPerson> whoat?
[10:03:44] <BillCriswell> I wish _why wrote tutorials for other languages.
[10:04:15] <tubbo> BadPerson: ember, being a JS framework for browsers, has nothing to do with your server side code. so you're free to build your API with whatever tools makes you feel happy. or makes you feel like an adult, whatever.
[10:04:29] <BadPerson> lol
[10:04:34] <tubbo> personally i believe in myself enough to know that even though i use toys like jQuery, Rails and Ruby...I'm still an adult
[10:04:36] <BadPerson> tubbo: r u upset now
[10:04:38] <tubbo> ;)
[10:04:39] <BadPerson> :D
[10:04:40] <tubbo> u mad bro
[10:04:50] <garciawebdev> maybe he likes assembler
[10:04:53] <BadPerson> did i hurt ur feelins
[10:04:56] <garciawebdev> like real rude boys
[10:04:58] <tubbo> BillCriswell: he doesn't write tutorials for *any* languages anymore
[10:05:08] <tubbo> haha
[10:05:15] <BillCriswell> tubbo: It's a shame. I loved his ruby guide.
[10:05:30] <garciawebdev> write an API in assembler and it'll be the fastest on earth
[10:05:39] <BadPerson> sory i jus dun like the idiotic syntax of ruby
[10:05:43] <garciawebdev> let me know when you're done :P
[10:05:44] <tubbo> BadPerson: but yeah you're good to go with any JS framework. kind of the beauty of that whole thing, it doesn't matter what your backend team is up to :)
[10:06:03] <tubbo> BadPerson: *shrug* that's why we have different langs, right? :)
[10:06:08] <BadPerson> yes
[10:06:17] <BadPerson> i dun even use python that much
[10:06:18] <tubbo> personally i hate javascript
[10:06:22] <tubbo> worst language ever made
[10:06:24] <BadPerson> coz of its syntax
[10:06:31] <BillCriswell> Miran Lipovaca's Learn You a Haskell for Great Good is fun, too.
[10:06:34] <tubbo> BadPerson: so you're a PHP guy huh?
[10:06:37] <BadPerson> im a c++ type of person
[10:06:43] <tubbo> BillCriswell: i read that, and it actually got me interested a bit in haskell
[10:06:47] <BadPerson> i like braces
[10:06:56] <BadPerson> and complicatedness
[10:06:56] <tubbo> BadPerson: yeah because C++ is the PINNACLE of great syntax amirite?? ;)
[10:07:08] <BadPerson> ya urite
[10:07:13] <BadPerson> :D
[10:07:23] <tubbo> you just don't like learning new languages, right?
[10:07:32] <tubbo> nobody in their right mind thinks C++ has great syntax or is beautiful
[10:07:34] <BadPerson> void lol(void *lol) {}
[10:07:43] <BadPerson> ^
[10:07:48] <tubbo> or is as understandable as C or more powerful than Smalltalk
[10:07:50] <shahin> any body help me about jquery
[10:08:03] <jonjo> how does .carousel(number) work? I have trued .carousel(5) and it went back to 0
[10:08:09] <glaksmono> sooo i noticed that when we're using .closest(), the context would be the child node, not the matched node.. is there a way to change this?
[10:08:09] <BadPerson> tubbo: i already know ruby
[10:08:14] <tubbo> BadPerson: C++ is, btw, powerful as balls
[10:08:24] <BillCriswell> jonjo: It's 0 based... you might want 4.
[10:08:24] <glaksmono> $('td').closest('tr'), the context will be td..
[10:08:26] <BadPerson> tubbo: i know c++
[10:09:01] <jonjo> BillCriswell: var length = $('div .item', $('.carousel-register-content')).length - 1;
[10:09:07] <shahin> how
[10:09:21] <shahin> milkl can we chat
[10:09:30] <jonjo> have subtracted 1
[10:09:51] <jonjo> $('.carousel').carousel(length);
[10:10:03] <BillCriswell> Is this bootstraps carousel?
[10:10:09] <jonjo> yes
[10:10:15] <BadPerson> tubbo: at least im starting to use frameworkds
[10:10:33] <BadPerson> a few months ago id try to use my own
[10:11:05] <BadPerson> but its for work so i need something documented
[10:11:57] <tubbo> BadPerson: i was writing JS before they had "frameworks".
[10:12:05] <tubbo> there was no jQuery, and there wasn't even Ajax.
[10:12:10] <BillCriswell> jonjo: Might be better asking in ##twitter-bootstrap
[10:12:19] <tubbo> in fact until ajax came along the need for a JS framework was considered "bloat" :)
[10:12:27] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure why it wouldn't work if your sure the number is all right.
[10:12:43] <BadPerson> tubbo: same here
[10:12:58] <BadPerson> i called mine newjax
[10:14:05] <BadPerson> tubbo: i try coding 3d engines now
[10:14:23] <BadPerson> so much more fun
[10:14:38] <BadPerson> but all this runtime programming did start w js for me
[10:15:19] <BillCriswell> bjax, the next ajax.
[10:15:35] <BillCriswell> bodacious javascript and xml.
[10:15:36] <tubbo> BadPerson: haha GL! ;)
[10:15:49] <tubbo> the 3d engine coding in JS looks kinda fun though
[10:15:57] <tubbo> i've just never needed to do it for a project so i never got into it
[10:16:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm using a custom build of jquery UI, but now I want to add this: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-style
[10:16:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How can that be done without building the whole library again?
[10:16:41] <BadPerson> tubbo: no i was talking about c++
[10:16:56] <BadPerson> i have a 3d engine for linux
[10:17:03] <BadPerson> well its crossplatform
[10:17:31] <beliveyourdream> can anyone help me with jquery autocomplete ? i've put a custom style on it but when i use up/down arrow i see no style .. like it doesn't hover the current element from the list
[10:17:38] <beliveyourdream> any ideea where should i look ?
[10:17:46] <BadPerson> tubbo: look http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQjbNgiGnLs
[10:18:11] <BadPerson> wish i had more time to work on it
[10:18:34] <BadPerson> i already have multiplayer if u wana play hehe
[10:20:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it best to use google hosted libraries or jquery hosted?
[10:20:26] <beliveyourdream> anyone ?
[10:23:28] <tubbo> BadPerson: i really like that dock on the bottom and all the OSX-style windows, how'd you do all that? ;)
[10:23:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't understand why the CSS file on google hosted libraries is not there for jquery ui
[10:23:41] <tubbo> BadPerson: wait...is that really counter-strike/HL engine in JS??
[10:25:30] <glaksmono> any ideas why i can't find the child node of SELECT from TD?
[10:25:33] <glaksmono> using find?
[10:25:38] <glaksmono> even children returns me empty span..
[10:25:56] <tubbo> glaksmono: you mean the <option> tags underneath a <select>?
[10:25:59] <glaksmono> yes
[10:26:03] <glaksmono> i want to disable the "select"
[10:26:05] <glaksmono> the whole option
[10:26:15] <BadPerson> tubbo: i told u its c++
[10:26:17] <tubbo> glaksmono: you want to disable the <select> tag itself?
[10:26:22] <tubbo> BadPerson: oh sorry :D
[10:26:24] <BadPerson> its only using quake map
[10:26:24] <glaksmono> tubbo: yes
[10:26:27] <BadPerson> and cs guns
[10:26:30] <tubbo> BadPerson: i was like wtf that looks amazing
[10:26:34] <tubbo> yeah...i did a mod for HL back in the day
[10:26:35] <BadPerson> and the player model someone made
[10:26:43] <tubbo> what, the chicken? :D
[10:26:54] <tubbo> BadPerson: so you created that engine yourself then? that's not based off the quake/HL engine?
[10:27:03] <BadPerson> no its not
[10:27:08] <glaksmono> tubbo: ideas?
[10:27:11] <tubbo> glaksmono: paste your code to gist.github.com
[10:27:23] <BadPerson> but it does use quake bsp
[10:27:24] <glaksmono> well it's just select that's under td
[10:27:26] <tubbo> glaksmono: not off the top of my head, something in your code must be wrong...like a bad selection or something
[10:27:40] <tubbo> glaksmono: so you're doing $('td select')?
[10:27:46] <BadPerson> HL engine is copy of quake
[10:27:52] <tubbo> glaksmono: so you're basically doing $('td select').find('option')?
[10:28:01] <tubbo> BadPerson: right exactly, with some small mods
[10:28:06] <BadPerson> yes
[10:28:10] <tubbo> BadPerson: what's "bsp"?
[10:28:14] <BadPerson> but thats just the map part
[10:28:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know why the CSS for jquery UI is not hosted on google?
[10:29:05] <tubbo> ecky--ptang-zoob: because it's jquery ui
[10:29:06] <tubbo> ;)
[10:29:16] <BadPerson> most of the stuff in my engine is newer technology than quake
[10:29:37] <tubbo> ecky--ptang-zoob: i found that most of the time with jQuery UI i do so much CSS customization that i typically don't want to use the CDN-hosted one. but i *believe* the CSS is obtainable off the google CDN, it's just difficult to find.
[10:29:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tubbo: the JS is hosted
[10:29:41] <tubbo> and not documented.
[10:30:07] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob:  http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.0/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:30:15] <wachpwnski> how do you create a span element in a selector? do you do something like $('#foo').append($(<span>));
[10:30:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> nice
[10:30:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[10:30:56] <BadPerson> basicly i code everything and research
[10:30:59] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: sure
[10:31:01] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob look in the jquery UI blog for other links
[10:31:16] <wachpwnski> NoiseEee: how do I add a class to that?
[10:31:55] <shoky> var span = $('<span>');  span.addClass('bla');  $('#foo').append(span);
[10:31:58] <wachpwnski> $('<span>').addClass('my-class')   inside?
[10:32:12] <wachpwnski> there you go, thanks shoky
[10:32:19] <shoky> your way would work too.
[10:32:59] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: you might want to go the other way' round.  $('<span>',{'class':'someClassName'}).text('HELLO EVERYONE').appendTo(something)
[10:33:07] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: whatever works for your style
[10:33:26] <shoky> people should know how to work with variables and shit before they learn chaining.
[10:34:12] <shoky> that came out kinda nazi, sry
[10:34:19] <BadPerson> lol
[10:34:26] <BadPerson> u kinda r
[10:34:37] <shoky> thank you
[10:34:44] <BadPerson> ur welcom
[10:34:57] <shoky> jew nazis are the best nazis
[10:36:17] <BadPerson> i think tubbo went to make his own 3d engine
[10:41:25] <gotwig> dblosevn: :>
[10:41:35] <gotwig> dblosevn: I was afk.. any idea?
[10:47:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with jquery ui tooltip?
[10:48:15] <tubbo> BadPerson: i wish i was that good
[10:48:27] <tubbo> no, sometimes i need to do real work
[10:48:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I read <br /> can be put in the title attribute, but that doesn't seem very legit
[10:48:32] <tubbo> in the middle of the day
[10:51:07] <shanejonas> ohai
[10:52:57] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: it's fine
[10:52:59] <gotwig> now really, what do I have to do to support iPad's with on click events???!
[10:53:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shoky: but W3C won't validate the code right then
[10:54:50] <TonyDusk> hi! I try use variable in attr and it no work. I get angry!!!!
[10:54:52] <TonyDusk> $('#plchldr').attr('src', thumbsrc)
[10:55:00] <zergion> is everything under location.reload(); being executed? Cause I have a hard time changing the css attribute of an element after it.
[10:55:16] <TonyDusk> thumbsrc set correctly.. it just no show up in attrib!
[10:58:04] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: any character is valid in an html attribute.. except quotes
[10:58:08] <gotwig> what do I have to do, to get iPad support??
[10:58:18] <gotwig> for on click event handlers
[10:58:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> k
[10:58:48] <systemfault> gotwig: Nothing.
[10:59:00] <gotwig> systemfault: well, it doesnt work
[10:59:03] <systemfault> gotwig: You'll only get a 300ms lag after a touch on a button
[10:59:24] <gotwig> systemfault: normal click event handlers work , but on click event handlers dont work
[10:59:34] <gotwig> systemfault: do you got an iPad?
[10:59:44] <systemfault> At home, yeah
[10:59:55] <systemfault> I'm at a café at the moment
[11:00:19] <gotwig> I dont even know why people use these things..
[11:00:47] <gotwig> I want extrem HTML5 capabilities, the iPad can't offer that
[11:00:53] <gotwig> more, I have to program fallbacks...
[11:00:56] <gotwig> wtf
[11:01:01] <NoiseEee> gotwig: things click fine don't they?
[11:01:02] <gotwig> I dont have to do that for Android devices
[11:01:06] <NoiseEee> or are you talking about drag/drop?
[11:01:13] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I talk about iPad support.
[11:01:25] <gotwig> NoiseEee: all event click handlers that use .on() don't work
[11:01:37] <NoiseEee> gotwig: where are you binding them to
[11:01:43] <NoiseEee> gotwig: iOS doesn't let you bind on document :)
[11:01:46] <gotwig> NoiseEee: wanna look at my code..?
[11:01:47] <NoiseEee> but you can bind on the body.
[11:02:25] <NoiseEee> iirc something i learned this weekend was that iOS doesn't bubble events up to document, so document.on('something') will not work.
[11:02:43] <gotwig> NoiseEee: what do you mean with bind to body
[11:02:46] <systemfault> NoiseEee: Thanks for sharing :)
[11:02:48] <gotwig> *on
[11:02:56] <systemfault> NoiseEee: I didn't know that.
[11:02:57] <gotwig> Safari is just a bad browser.
[11:03:00] <gotwig> Thats it
[11:03:06] <NoiseEee> gotwig: well, to which element are you binding '.on' ?
[11:03:23] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I guess document....
[11:03:35] <NoiseEee> gotwig: well don't guess look at the code!
[11:03:36] <gotwig> NoiseEee: so please tell me about a replacement
[11:03:41] <gotwig> NoiseEee: document
[11:03:44] <zergion> why doesn't this work? http://pastebin.com/QYGucZaT
[11:03:46] <systemfault> gotwig: document.body instead?
[11:03:48] <gotwig> NoiseEee: and my PC lags like hell.
[11:03:54] <gotwig> pls wait
[11:04:23] <NoiseEee> gotwig: $('body').on('click','button',function() {console.log('a button was clicked and safari noticed');});
[11:04:32] <gotwig> NoiseEee: so I just have to bind them on body?
[11:04:37] <systemfault> zergion: I would try callng .reload() after setting the styles
[11:04:39] <NoiseEee> gotwig: thats-a-what-im-sayin
[11:04:50] <NoiseEee> gotwig: assuming you're doing it on document.
[11:05:10] <chachan> hi guys, I would like to know how could I remove all parameters from a URL and reload it. I tried playing with window.location but it always keep the "?" charater at the end of the URL, any ideas?
[11:05:12] <NoiseEee> gotwig: if you're finding $('#someElID').on('click') doesn't fire, then i dunno what your issues is gotwig
[11:05:15] <zergion> systemfault dont work either.
[11:05:18] <gotwig> NoiseEee:
[11:05:21] <gotwig> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/QYGucZaT
[11:05:47] <gotwig> wrong aste....
[11:05:50] <systemfault> zergion: The syntax looks fine ;/
[11:05:50] <gotwig> *paste
[11:05:59] <LocalPCGuy> gotwig better would be to understand that .on() can be bound on any element, and so you can (and should) bind it to the closest parent element that is static on the page and contains the elements you are listening for events on
[11:06:10] <gotwig> http://pastebin.com/1CwWnTYe
[11:06:15] <LocalPCGuy> gotwig (better than just moving the binding to body)
[11:06:26] <NoiseEee> gotwig: yeah line 13/20 etc
[11:06:40] <systemfault> gotwig: replace $(document) with $(document.body) for the .on
[11:06:42] <NoiseEee> gotwig: and as LocalPCGuy says, listening on document (or even body) is expensive!
[11:06:56] <zergion> will a div with visibility:visible when changed to hidden, also hide all divs under it?
[11:06:58] <gotwig> ...
[11:07:11] <NoiseEee> also, you're lucky i learned that!
[11:07:12] <NoiseEee> :)
[11:07:13] <LocalPCGuy> NoiseEee that part about iOS not bubbling to document was one of my takeaways from jQuery TO as well
[11:07:15] <systemfault> zergion: Of course..
[11:07:20] <NoiseEee> LocalPCGuy: yeah man, mindblowing
[11:08:01] <sgrover> Is there an IRC channel for qUnit?
[11:08:10] <TonyDusk> hi, someone please help. Tell Tony why variable dont put url.  http://jsfiddle.net/TonyDusk/cUaKV/
[11:08:16] <Krinkle> sgrover: No, general support is in here and devs are in #jquery-dev
[11:08:25] <Krinkle> QUnit :0
[11:08:42] <NoiseEee> TonyDusk: try "prop" instead of "attr"
[11:08:50] <TonyDusk> ok, I try
[11:08:50] <Marcky> hi
[11:08:51] <sgrover> Thanks.
[11:09:25] <Marcky> is it possible to add margin when you snap a draggable?
[11:09:40] <gotwig> NoiseEee: When I bind it on body...
[11:09:50] <NoiseEee> Marcky: i'd imagine its easier to add a class that defines the margin
[11:09:51] <gotwig> NoiseEee: It doesnt work
[11:09:57] <sgrover> I have an anchor that sometimes behaves as a default link, and other times triggers an AJAX request instead.  Is there any way to test if results were from an Ajax call?
[11:09:58] <gotwig> at all, everywhere
[11:10:13] <NoiseEee> gotwig: well dude, console.log() / debug and see what you did wrong.
[11:10:16] <sgrover> without me having to set up flags that is...
[11:10:38] <systemfault> sgrover: Look in your dev tools to see if a XHR happened
[11:10:52] <gotwig> NoiseEee: http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project
[11:10:57] <sgrover> systemfault: thanks, but I need to do this from code - I'm writing unit tests.
[11:11:09] <gotwig> oh..
[11:11:15] <NoiseEee> gotwig: i can't stand that you ripped off disney
[11:11:17] <gotwig> I know
[11:11:19] <NoiseEee> gotwig: i was going to mention it last week
[11:11:25] <NoiseEee> gotwig: but enough, change the BG
[11:11:28] <gotwig> NoiseEee: NO, please dont do that
[11:11:41] <NoiseEee> dude its theft outright
[11:11:48] <NoiseEee> its a copyrighted image.
[11:11:49] <gotwig> NoiseEee: Its a direct link, dude
[11:11:54] <NoiseEee> ok, glwt
[11:12:00] <gotwig> NoiseEee: what?
[11:12:06] <NoiseEee> gotwig: good luck with that
[11:12:27] <gotwig> NoiseEee: ;D It looks awesome, doesnt it? find me an alternative or help me where to find a better one if you like...
[11:13:06] <gotwig> ok, now I retry on iPad
[11:13:10] <gotwig> standby...
[11:14:12] <LocalPCGuy> gotwig just because you can hotlink doesn't mean you can use the image without permission
[11:14:29] <zergion> var deleteId = 5; $('div[id=deleteId]').remove(); how do I specify the var deleteId inside the (' ')?
[11:14:59] <tubbo> LocalPCGuy: i think the golden rule of the internet is "it's legal if it's possible"
[11:15:16] <NoiseEee> zergion: if its really an ID, why not $('#'+deleteID)
[11:15:19] <tubbo> kinda like the golden rule of reality: "if i can touch them, they're real"
[11:15:26] <LocalPCGuy> zergion  you can just do $('div[id=' + deleteId + ']')
[11:15:44] <T-Gunn> hello all, i am trying to extend a googlemaps plugin for some features i need/want.. i added a function to do reverse geocoding and I am trying to get the city, county, state and country based on the click in the map.. i am having a problem with scope because within the geocoder.geocode() it is defined but once i get out of it it becomes undefined. even variables like this.city that i define
[11:15:44] <T-Gunn> in init() lose their value after it gets out of geocode(). how can I maintain the information outside of geocode() ?
[11:15:52] <LocalPCGuy> NoiseEee guessing it is a numeric ID
[11:16:03] <LocalPCGuy> tubbo :)
[11:16:28] <dcherman> tubbo: Just because it's possible doesn't make it right.  You wouldn't strip the license comment out of jQuery for your site just because "it's possible" would you?
[11:18:08] <zergion> NoiseEee yeah, that did the trick. However I have several elements with the same id and I need to remove them all. Care to tell me why this simple script only delete one of them? http://pastebin.com/Tw9SDGEE
[11:19:01] <shoky> dcherman i think tubbo was being sarcastic
[11:19:12] <shoky> gotwig, on the other hand...
[11:19:16] <NoiseEee> zergion: more than one element with the same ID is bad html and will surely mess up any JS
[11:19:22] <dcherman> shoky: in this case, sarcasm fail on my part :(
[11:19:24] <NoiseEee> zergion: s/bad/invalid
[11:19:28] <dcherman> s/this/that
[11:20:17] <zergion> NoiseEee u are right, fixed it now. Only one id
[11:20:22] <NoiseEee> zergion: sweet
[11:20:25] <TonyDusk> i cant seem to overstand why img src attrib isnt changing here: http://jsfiddle.net/TonyDusk/cUaKV/
[11:20:28] <zergion> indeed
[11:20:36] <shoky> !
[11:20:40] <shoky> overstand++
[11:20:53] <TonyDusk> noisee 'prop' didn't work
[11:21:06] <NoiseEee> TonyDusk: scope.
[11:21:11] <TonyDusk> soky © :)
[11:21:42] <systemfault> TonyDusk: Indentation is the key..
[11:22:22] <NoiseEee> TonyDusk: here is your fiddle properly indented.  much easier to find the issue i'd say?  http://jsfiddle.net/cUaKV/1/
[11:22:36] <TonyDusk> i'll check
[11:27:54] <TonyDusk> NoiseEee, systemfault: good lookin out, my ppl!
[11:28:01] <gotwig> jeutleira
[11:28:10] <gotwig> NoiseEee: hey
[11:28:17] <gotwig> NoiseEee: it doesnt work.
[11:28:31] <NoiseEee> what, iOS or everything or?
[11:29:35] <gotwig> NoiseEee: iOS.
[11:29:39] <gotwig> shitOS
[11:29:46] <gotwig> you can call it like you want
[11:29:51] <adamsilver> i need a visual effect of sending something to a div. Is there a plugin for that? I basically want to allow users to click on a link called "add to compare list" and have some visual effect
[11:30:07] <T-Gunn> i am using geocoder.geocode() in a plugin and i need the results array information to live outside that function.. how can I do this?
[11:30:18] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I gotta go to eat.. To prepare for the next "fight".
[11:30:39] <NoiseEee> T-Gunn: bind it something with permanence, either an object/module, or in worse case, window
[11:31:28] <NoiseEee> T-Gunn: window.globallyAvailableLatLng = googleReponse.latlng(); kind of thing
[11:32:34] <tomasm-> hi, with the UI accordion, how do I trigger (programatically) opening the next accordion box? ie for a 'next step' button.... there is no more 'activate' functionality from what I can tell (UI 1.10)
[11:33:52] <dhci> I'm getting an ajax .always response where data.responseText is an empty string. Can I see a simple example somewhere of http headers and body text of say Content-Type: application/json and a JSON string that should satisfy jQuery?
[11:34:06] <gotwig> NoiseEee: meeh, what to do now??!
[11:34:07] <shoky> tomasm-:  'active' option
[11:34:20] <tomasm-> shoky, thanks
[11:35:02] <NoiseEee> gotwig: i'd try reproducing some small stuff to make sure it works on iOS and go from there
[11:35:11] <NoiseEee> gotwig: you never know where else document is binding
[11:35:19] <NoiseEee> bound
[11:35:36] <wachpwnski> did .live get replaced?
[11:36:06] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/gUjWP/ My button action is not working.
[11:36:24] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: yes, its been deprecated for a while and out of 1.9+ afaik
[11:36:38] <shanejonas> .live was deprecated in 1.7 removed 1.9
[11:36:39] <wachpwnski> we just use .click now?
[11:36:46] <NoiseEee> no, you should use .on
[11:36:51] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ wachpwnski
[11:36:54] <shanejonas> .delegate/on
[11:37:04] <dhci> ok I think I had a post from from a local file (web form) and posting to a localhost webserver process
[11:37:25] <LocalPCGuy> wachpwnski you may benefit from the migrate plugin
[11:37:46] <systemfault> Only .on should be used with 1.9
[11:38:00] <systemfault> You can forget all the other ones
[11:38:18] <T-Gunn> NoiseEee: ok thanks ill try that. i tried setting a property (http://jsfiddle.net/rc4aT/ at the bottom geoCodeCity ) and i can set it and console.log it while in geocode() but the next line after geocode() closes it is undefined...
[11:39:00] <LocalPCGuy> T-Gunn sounds like you are having problems with the async nature of JS
[11:39:05] <tomasm-> hmmm, whats the easiest way to get the index of the 'next' accordion panel, based on an element (a button) inside the previous one? I can do j(this).closest('.ui-accordion-content'), but is there a way to find out it's index (since it's intermixed with h3 and divs)? without a really super long string of code hopefully
[11:39:15] <LocalPCGuy> T-Gunn or scoping
[11:40:09] <T-Gunn> i figured it is a scope issue, but that property should be global ?
[11:42:07] <NoiseEee> T-Gunn: its complicated, and depends on how you have structured your script/app/functions
[11:42:10] <shoky> tomasm-: just getting the current 'active' option isn't enough?
[11:42:30] <tomasm-> shoky, I suppose that works, too. didn't think of it as a getter
[11:43:55] <T-Gunn> NoiseEee: thanks, ill keep trying.. gotta reboot
[11:49:11] <wachpwnski> how do you access a key from an ajax request with space in it?
[11:49:13] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a ready-to-go file-input button replacement? i know there's a way to style using a fake element on top, but I'd like some library code that does it for me instead of hand coding
[11:49:21] <wachpwnski> data.'
[11:49:35] <wachpwnski> like data.key but what if it is like data.'my key'
[11:51:18] <Otineb> hey everyone. Does anybody know how to target multiple selectors? I've tried nearly every formatting variant with no luck. $('#function1').rules("add", {… vs $('#stuff,#stuff2').rules("add", { … or $('[#stuff1],[#stuff2]').rules("add", {
[11:51:32] <Otineb> none seem to work
[11:51:37] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: data['my key']  but keys should not have spaces.
[11:53:48] <ShamanIotasTook> hoping someone has an idea: i have a canvas element, i need to reflect each of 3 states (user||app||realm) and somehow distinguish visually which of the three (or two or all three in combination) are set...easy to check programatically, but what can i use as visual indicator besides picking one-side of the boarder for each property and coloring appropriately? any ideas?
[11:54:16] <gotwig> NoiseEee: Alright, I search ...
[11:54:41] <gotwig> NoiseEee: Can I just bind it to my div?
[11:54:58] <NoiseEee> gotwig: certainly that would be the preferred practice if the buttons only exist within it
[11:55:05] <gotwig> NoiseEee: yeah
[11:58:09] <gotwig> NoiseEee: $('#resizable')("click", ".resetFont", function(e){
[11:58:12] <gotwig> Object is not a function?
[11:58:34] <NoiseEee> has jquery been loaded before this time?
[11:58:35] <gotwig> oh, the .on... lol
[11:59:15] <gotwig> alright
[11:59:20] <gotwig> now I go to the bad iOS
[11:59:22] <gotwig> ...
[11:59:24] <gotwig> stand by
[12:00:05] <BadPerson> lol
[12:02:50] <gotwig> NoiseEee: so it doesnt work.
[12:02:59] <gotwig> NoiseEee: Actually, I have .on events which do work
[12:05:08] <NoiseEee> well good luck, i hope you're on your way, imma do my paying job stuff before fireds
[12:10:50] <sgrover> Using qUnit.  Restarting tests after some interaction.  I'm doing QUnit.reset() and QUnit.init();  If I re-run my tests, I just get 'Running...'.  Any suggestions?
[12:14:24] <StephenS> wow
[12:14:36] <StephenS> In my jquery cookbook, they recommend this channel for support if I have any problems :D
[12:14:37] <StephenS> Nice
[12:15:27] <chachan> is this a good place to ask about DOM stuff?
[12:17:50] <jrockjiggz> chachan: i may or may not be
[12:17:55] <jrockjiggz> *it
[12:19:42] <chachan> well, there it goes. I have this: location.replace(location.protocol + "//" + location.host + location.pathname);
[12:19:42] <chachan> for some reason it works when I do it through the console, but it's appending the "?" character when it runs normally. I just want to remove all parameter in the URL
[12:20:30] <jrockjiggz> I wouldn't consider the param a problem, as long as its empty
[12:20:30] <chachan> of course, I did: var location = window.location;
[12:21:09] <StephenS> Why dont you use $() already implemented functions to manipulate with dom?
[12:21:12] <chachan> jrockjiggz, I need it clean since I read parameters when page loads
[12:21:19] <StephenS> Its better than the references with js
[12:21:37] <StephenS> You can also clean params you dont like with .end()
[12:21:48] <jrockjiggz> chachan: There is a useful plugin called deparam by ajpiano (??)
[12:22:05] <jrockjiggz> chachan: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[12:23:59] <LocalPCGuy> chachan you could always do this: url = location.protocol + "//" + location.host + location.pathname; url = url.split('?')[0];
[12:24:34] <LocalPCGuy> chachan you may want to test if ? exists in the string first
[12:25:00] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, it doesn't exist, that's the weird issue
[12:25:36] <LocalPCGuy> chachan it must exist in some cases, are you saying it is always there?
[12:27:46] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, I've tried almost everything using variables, substring, replacing, checking, logging. The "?" doesn't appear but when I call the replace function (or even direct assigment to window.location), it appears at the end of the loaded URL >.<
[12:28:05] <TheCompWiz> Can anyone give me some tips as to how to identify the data types/structure of the results from an ajax query?  (it's all json data... but how do I identify if it's a single string, array, etc...)
[12:28:25] <chachan> TheCompWiz, using length?
[12:28:44] <TheCompWiz> chachan: how would that tell me what it is?
[12:29:14] <ajpiano> TheCompWiz: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.type/
[12:29:36] <chachan> TheCompWiz, no, that would tell you just the length
[12:31:46] <LocalPCGuy> chachan just for fun, did you make sure you are in icognito mode and don't have any plugins running when testing (just to rule that out)
[12:32:32] <LocalPCGuy> chachan other than that, you'll probably need to do a fiddle or something to show the code you are working with
[12:32:57] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, no, I haven't run it as incognito. In fact I have a lot of plugins =/
[12:33:22] <TheCompWiz> ajpiano: thanks... that hit the head on the nail.
[12:33:27] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, sure, let me do that
[12:35:09] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, didn't work as incognito. I'm pasting the code
[12:37:25] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/gGyDV/
[12:38:12] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, I have a list of "tags", which I send to web server to query database, etc, etc
[12:39:10] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, my problem is on line 35. When I remove all selected tags
[12:39:41] <jrabbit> Why is $("body").children()[0].children() invalid?
[12:40:13] <LocalPCGuy> chachan btw, I'm on a train, so connectivity could be intermittent
[12:40:33] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, nice :)
[12:40:53] <chachan> you should change your nickname then heh
[12:41:16] <jrabbit> I'm rather confused how the object becomes >ypeError: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLElement> is not a function
[12:41:34] <chachan> OnTrainPCGuy could be an option :p
[12:42:35] <BillCriswell> jrabbit: Sure you don't want .children() ?
[12:42:54] <BillCriswell> Oh duh.
[12:42:54] <jrabbit> BillCriswell: hrm?
[12:43:03] <BillCriswell> didn't see your code before that.
[12:43:05] <jrabbit> I'm just confused why its incongrous
[12:43:36] <jrabbit> I was running into this before and I thought it was a coffeescript problem but it's with my understanding of whats going on with jquery
[12:43:38] <BillCriswell> jrabbit: Doing [0] just gives you the dom element. You could do .children().children() but it might be a bit much?
[12:43:52] <BillCriswell> .children()[0] doesn't give you the first child.
[12:44:01] <jrabbit> BillCriswell: well the idea is I want to iterate over the DOM elements
[12:44:36] <BillCriswell> jrabbit: You want to get the first elements children?
[12:45:02] <jrabbit> I want to walk the elements for ones containing visible text I guess
[12:45:20] <jeffreylevesque> can someone tell me why the following code doesn't push items into a double array:
[12:45:22] <jeffreylevesque> http://pastebin.com/Q17ipP1z
[12:45:34] <jrabbit> I guess the visible is something I can do with a selector
[12:45:50] <BillCriswell> visible on a text node or the element?
[12:46:16] <jrabbit> the text not the element I guess
[12:46:23] <jrabbit> if an element doesn't have text I'll skip it
[12:46:47] <LocalPCGuy> chachan consider using location.search instead of using the regex version of .search off of the href parameter?
[12:48:06] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, sure, I could change it
[12:48:12] <jrabbit> BillCriswell: I guess I want to loop a bit
[12:48:17] <LocalPCGuy> chachan I see you are using it a few lines later,
[12:48:23] <aghouseh> is there a way to somehow save a reference to a DOM position?
[12:48:34] <jrabbit> BillCriswell: so let me get back to something useful, how would I get the first element without getting the DOM element?
[12:48:38] <aghouseh> i want to remove an element, but save its location in the DOM somehow for later insertion
[12:49:40] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: Why not just hide it?
[12:49:58] <aghouseh> its template markup
[12:49:59] <BillCriswell> jrabbit: You can do .eq(0) or .first()
[12:50:16] <BillCriswell> There's a few more ways as well.
[12:50:20] <NoiseEee> aghouseh: then a superfluous wrapper perhaps
[12:50:27] <aghouseh> hm
[12:50:46] <aghouseh> im trying to avoid errant, unneeded markup though :/
[12:50:50] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, changed to: location.search.toString().indexOf("?") >= 0
[12:51:08] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, but still getting the same result about removing "?"
[12:51:09] <LocalPCGuy> chachan you could just test (location.search.length)
[12:51:09] <aghouseh> too bad detach doesnt store the dom position
[12:51:24] <LocalPCGuy> chachan but that isn't going to solve the issue
[12:51:40] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, I guessed that, no problem :)
[12:51:56] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: Could index() help?
[12:52:01] <aghouseh> hmm
[12:52:27] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, before replacing the URL, "search" doesn't have the "?"
[12:52:37] <BillCriswell> If the HTML goes deep it won't be ideal, but if it's just a simple list of elements it could do the trick.
[12:53:24] <aghouseh> i have a page with a bunch of feeds and returned data to populate, and im just trying to abstract all of it as cleanly as possible
[12:53:30] <aghouseh> so i dont think it would really be that reliable
[12:54:27] <BillCriswell> Are you looking for something like [ [1, 'text'], [2, 'more text'] ] ?
[12:54:35] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, before replacing, location.search.location has 13, which is the amount of characters that I want to remove
[12:54:35] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: ^
[12:55:36] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: I'm looking for something more like
[12:55:38] <jeffreylevesque> current_arr[save_index][i] = $('.rotator-thumbnail:eq('+i+') .short_title').text();
[12:56:00] <jeffreylevesque> but that's not working
[12:56:03] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, I will check if "?" is the last charater so I could ignore it (also remove it after loaded)
[12:57:00] <aghouseh> BillCriswell: im reading multiple (or not) items from different feeds on the same page
[12:57:06] <LocalPCGuy> chachan yah, in the end it really shouldn't hurt anything to have it there with no params as someone said earlier
[12:57:34] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, yeah, but I would need to change the parsing thing then
[12:57:39] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, testing...
[12:58:10] <TonyDusk> any one know a simple way how I can disable the background when it fades out?  - http://jsfiddle.net/TonyDusk/cUaKV/4/
[12:58:36] <TonyDusk> i dont want the thumbs to be clickable
[13:00:12] <LocalPCGuy> chachan good luck
[13:01:43] <LocalPCGuy> chachan without being able to run/debug I'm not sure what's happening.  you may try putting debugger; in the code near the beginning of the file and then open it with the console open in Chrome/step through your code - might show you were the ? is coming from
[13:02:52] <LocalPCGuy> TonyDusk easiest way it to add an overlay that covers the screen but is under your image that pops up
[13:03:21] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You sure that's what you need? It's an odd way to store that information.
[13:03:26] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, when you say "debugger", what do you mean?, I debug using console.log, is there a better way to debug? I'm feeling like a newbie
[13:03:44] <LocalPCGuy> chachan debugger; in your code will create a breakpoint there
[13:03:47] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ chachan
[13:03:54] <Eviltwin> Ugh, seriously?
[13:03:59] <TonyDusk> LocalPCGuy: thanks that make sense

[13:04:08] <LocalPCGuy> chachan and I'm not an expert by any means
[13:04:19] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: http://jsbin.com/iyemiq/1/edit would do what you want.
[13:04:37] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, hm, debug using the chrome console
[13:05:20] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: I believe.. at least.
[13:06:24] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/d12ccwHY
[13:06:28] <jeffreylevesque> count == 5 in my case
[13:06:30] <LocalPCGuy> chachan you can step through your code live using the console.  First you set a beak point, and your code will run to that breakpoint.  Then you'll have a couple icons in the top right, play, step into, step over
[13:06:36] <kripster> could someone tell me, I have a radio button, on click of yes it expands my dropdown, on click of no it collapses it. How can i put a check on that if it already collapsed then do nothing and vice versa for expanded http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/122/,,thx
[13:06:41] <LocalPCGuy> chachan use step into to go line by line through your code
[13:07:07] <LocalPCGuy> chachan you can hover over elements to see their value, and they are logged in a window in the dev tools as well
[13:07:12] <LocalPCGuy> (I think)
[13:07:44] <aeee> Hi world
[13:07:50] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, oh yes, I have experince debugging with C++, I thought you were meaning something else like a library that inspect things or something weirder
[13:07:51] <chachan> :)
[13:07:56] <LocalPCGuy> chachan arriving at the station, good luck
[13:07:59] <chachan> aeee, hola mundo
[13:08:00] <LocalPCGuy> chachan no prob
[13:08:20] <LocalPCGuy> chachan well, hopefully someone else will see that and get some use from it
[13:08:22] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[13:08:26] <chachan> LocalPCGuy, thanks for all your helping and good wishes :)
[13:08:33] <LocalPCGuy> thanks
[13:09:17] <kripster> in other words how can i put an if statement to check if the dropdown is collapsed or expanded then execute actions? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/122/ thx
[13:09:26] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/5jPu5/1/    hi! does anyone have 4 minutes for me?
[13:12:17] <agrach> http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/5jPu5/2/  more clear aim
[13:14:09] <chachan> Eviltwin, nice documentation :)
[13:14:31] <chachan> Eviltwin, didn't know about the "debugger" statement
[13:16:19] <aeee> I m not a dev and i need somehing i guess it is quite easy but not for me here my question if someone can  help  > > http://pastebin.fr/26553
[13:16:40] <aeee> thanks for any help
[13:16:46] <YaManicKill> hey guys, I've got a function I want to call several times, and before I just had it defined within the call for a link to be clicked. however, I want it to be a standalone function, obviously. it also requires the event to be passed through so I can call e.preventDefault. how do I pass this through to a standalone function from a .click(functionName()) ? example: http://jsbin.com/iciyiq/1/edit
[13:18:04] <tw2113> does that not work as is?
[13:18:18] <kripster> so in other words how can i put an if statement to check if the dropdown is collapsed or expanded then execute actions? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/122/ thx
[13:18:41] <YaManicKill> tw2113: it complains about e not existing when I click on the link
[13:18:49] <ShamanIotasTook> .click({a:'a',b:'b'},function(e){var a=event.data.a; var b=event.data.b; event.preventDefault();});
[13:19:04] <ShamanIotasTook> it think that's what you are asking? right YaManicKill
[13:19:20] <ShamanIotasTook> sorry (event. is supposed to be e.)
[13:19:35] <ShamanIotasTook> .click({a:'a',b:'b'},function(e){var a=e.data.a; var b=e.data.b; e.preventDefault();});
[13:19:40] <YaManicKill> ShamanIotasTook: no, I get all that. But I don't want the function to be embedded inside the click() function. I want it to be outside of the call. did you see my link?
[13:20:27] <tw2113> function declaration is outside of it
[13:20:40] <tw2113> you're just passing an instance of it into the click
[13:21:06] <YaManicKill> oh, so I don't need to pass e through to it at all? I'm just saying "use this function2?
[13:21:24] <tw2113> i would imagine you still need to pass in the click event
[13:21:47] <mattalexx> What is a good library for modeling things on the client and seamlessly handling AJAX data?
[13:22:34] <YaManicKill> yeah, that doesn't work
[13:22:46] <YaManicKill> it's still complaining e doesn't exist for some reason inside the function this time though
[13:22:55] <YaManicKill> so I do need to pass the event through but I don't know how
[13:23:39] <agrach> missing some hlp with .mouseout() method http://jsfiddle.net/agrach/5jPu5/2/
[13:23:57] <kripster> so how can i check my collapsible so it will only expand when it is collapsed, in other words if(#expand).bind(collapse){expand collapsible} http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/122/ thanks guys
[13:28:38] <tomasm-> hi, for some reason, calling $('option').text() returns undefined, whereas $('option').html() returns the displayed value. any idea why the difference? I've had inconsistent results between jquery versions. ie jquery 1.7.1 returns undefined
[13:30:33] <tw2113> damn, yamanickill left
[13:31:20] <kripster> so any ideas guys, i just want to check what condition the collapsible is in before i do anything?http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/122/
[13:35:32] <kripster> got it,
[13:46:47] <HankHendrix> has anyone had trouble adding a new prop to an object inside a forEach??
[13:47:55] <HankHendrix> has anyone had trouble adding a new prop to an object inside a forEach??
[13:49:14] <chinoto> huh, you're in here as well
[13:50:47] <aleray> hi, is there a jquery equivalent to the omit function of underscorejs (http://underscorejs.org/#omit) ?
[13:51:18] <chinoto> Would it be a good idea to change from something like this "function a() {return <?=json_encode($var)?>;}" to this "var a=(function() {var b=<?=json_encode($var)?>; return function() {return b;}})()"? It's for an autocomplete with semi-static list.
[13:56:46] <dcherman> aleray: what would an omit function do?  omit elements in the set that match a selector?
[13:57:55] <aleray> dcherman, from underscorejs doc: Return a copy of the object, filtered to omit the blacklisted keys (or array of keys).
[13:58:07] <chinoto> $('blah').not('meh')
[13:58:29] <chinoto> err...
[13:58:33] <aleray> dcherman, but actually I was looking for something slightly different: to backlist the attributes and not the keys
[13:59:30] <dcherman> aleray: so you probably want this: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[14:05:06] <Stiepen> gah
[14:05:24] <Stiepen> someone already registered my usual nick D:
[14:05:41] <Stiepen> meh
[14:06:00] <Kilobyte22> that works too
[14:09:52] <Kilobyte22> this is actually the biggest channel i have seen so for on any network xD
[14:10:03] <Kilobyte22> the most i've seen so far was like 400
[14:14:00] <glaksmono> if we run foo.bar.baz.CONSTANT
[14:14:05] <glaksmono> would it also run the constructor?
[14:38:03] <shoky> glaksmono: what constructor
[14:39:15] <adamsilver> how do i get the first url in a div?
[14:41:04] <shoky> adamsilver: meaning?
[14:41:13] <daekano> boaz: good talk over the weekend. props to not putting up with brogrammer douchebag questions.
[14:43:55] <ctorp> is it possible to remove the topmost element of a nested jquery selection? basically unwrap everything inside the top element.
[14:44:52] <shoky> ?unwrap
[14:44:53] <bot-t> .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[14:45:48] <coldhead> gob bless you shoky
[14:46:16] <ctorp> I tried using item='<div class="test"><div class="new"></div></div>'; $(item).unwrap();, but did not get '<div class="new"></div>'
[14:46:50] <shoky> did you read how to use .unwrap() ?
[14:46:54] <adamsilver> why i get "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'attr'" with this: el.find('a')[0].attr('href')
[14:47:10] <shoky> adamsilver:  you want .eq(0)  not [0]
[14:47:23] <shoky> (or .first()  or .find('a:first')  etc)
[14:47:25] <ctorp> shoky: yes. I read it.
[14:47:31] <Gho5t> [0] == native dom?
[14:47:39] <adamsilver> shoky: thanks that worked
[14:48:01] <shoky> Gho5t the underlying element, yea
[14:48:13] <ctorp> does unwrap not work if the parent is the topmost element in the dom structure?
[14:48:25] <shoky> ctorp:     .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM
[14:48:52] <shoky> read all the words, not just some of them
[14:49:28] <ctorp> so how would I select the topmost element in the item structure?
[14:49:43] <shoky> why do you want to select the topmost element?
[14:50:01] <ctorp> to create a wrapper around a node that isn't part of the dom at the time of this run
[14:50:34] <shoky> now you want to wrap?
[14:50:48] <ctorp> wrap then unwrap when done
[14:51:10] <ctorp> I was using item above to simulate the wrapped state
[14:51:20] <ctorp> Presumably learning to do one will enable me to do the other
[14:51:35] <shoky> your 'item' is just an html string
[14:51:50] <shoky> calling $(item).unwrap()  won't touch that html string
[14:52:08] <ctorp> Is there a way to use jquery to work on it?
[14:52:34] <shoky> meh
[14:53:16] <ctorp> meh?
[14:53:32] <recurse> if i create a cuntion like function loadinto(divID,url); how would i pass them via jquery click event?
[14:53:39] <recurse> them - the params
[14:54:56] <kripster> ok, so i have a text field that only allows two words, on the click of space after the second word i get an alert, after this alert how can i disable the field and only allow user to activate it again by pressing delete? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/123/ any ideas guys?
[14:55:50] <recurse> kripster: yes, set a boolean = true / false
[14:56:03] <recurse> var yourFlag = false;
[14:56:19] <shoky> ctorp: er sorry, dont think it's possible to use it if the elements aren't in the DOM already
[14:56:32] <kripster> recurse: not sure how i can do that
[14:56:36] <recurse> then wrap your stuff in if(!yourFlag){ // do somthing }
[14:56:43] <recurse> and inside that set the flag to true
[14:57:26] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can you please take a look at this code. it get a bit jumbled up the first time it runs, then it works fine. http://jsfiddle.net/bsfPx/
[14:58:22] <ctorp> shoky: thanks
[14:59:19] <shoky> ctorp: but my point was supposed to be that you need to call .unwrap() not on the parent, but on the child
[14:59:48] <krz> how does one trigger click events on attributes?
[14:59:51] <krz> data-attributes
[15:00:37] <shoky> krz: attributes dont have click events
[15:00:59] <krz> an element with a data-attribute
[15:01:09] <krz> nvm figured
[15:01:27] <kripster> recurse: so after the alert i need to set that text field to disable, if the textfield is focused on and the delete button is pressed then delete the space and enable the field?
[15:02:37] <recurse> i have no idea what you want to do, i just thought its a simple way to prevent multiple executions of the same function or event. just a common technique
[15:03:49] <kripster> recurse: what i want is to prevent a user from entering more than two words, which is kinda what i have done as when the user presses space to enter a third word it gives the alert that only first and second name can be entered
[15:05:28] <kripster> any ideas?
[15:05:34] <dblosevn> kripster: $('yourtectbox.selector').on('keyup', function (e) { if (this.value.split(' ') == 3) { this.value.replace(/ $/, ''); $(this).prop('disabled'); } });
[15:07:52] <kripster> dblosevn:sorry i don't follow, did you seemy example http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/123/
[15:08:44] <dblosevn> kripster: $('yourdeletebuttonselector').on('click', function() { var $el = $('yourtextboxselector'); var tmp = $el.val().split(' '); if (tmp.length == 3) { $el.val(tmp[0] + ' ' tmp[1]); } $el.prop('disabled', false); $el.focus(); });
[15:09:24] <dblosevn> $('yourtectbox.selector').on('keyup', function (e) { if (this.value.split(' ').length == 3) {this.value.replace(/ $/, ''); $(this).prop('disabled'); } });
[15:09:31] <dblosevn> sorry the first line was wrong
[15:10:23] <dblosevn> that listens to keyup on the text box and sees if there are 2 spaces, if there are it disables the input
[15:10:31] <dblosevn> and strips the trailing space
[15:11:03] <dblosevn> if the delete button is pressed, it removes the last word and reenables the text field and sets focus back on the textfield
[15:11:27] <dblosevn> seemed to meet your requirements
[15:11:30] <kripster> soz i'm lost, what delete button?
[15:11:42] <kripster> although I follow your logic
[15:11:45] <shoky> dblosevn:  better put that .replace() return value back inside this.value :P
[15:12:15] <dblosevn> shoky: yes you are right lol jus woke up lol first line of code for the day
[15:12:31] <shoky> iz ok
[15:13:06] <dblosevn> kripster: i took you literally... if the textfield is focusedon and the delete button is pressed
[15:13:33] <shoky> uh oh
[15:13:34] <kripster> o right, soz i mean as in the delete button of keyboard
[15:13:36] <dblosevn> you meant the delete key on the keyboard, i thought you meant an actual button in the ui
[15:13:45] <kripster> correctamondo
[15:13:56] <kripster> yeah am doing this for a mobile device
[15:14:27] <dblosevn> im gonna have to wake up a bit more to help you out there
[15:14:40] <dblosevn> you cant disable the field if thats the case
[15:14:55] <retral> Hey guys.. never used jQuery, but needing to incorporate it to a college project. Any tips on where to start?
[15:15:01] <dblosevn> youll have to se a keydown listener instead
[15:15:05] <dblosevn> *use
[15:15:19] <dblosevn> and return false if there are more then 2 words
[15:15:36] <kripster> yeah i know, i can apply that but when applying your code at the minute it is not disabling the field, lemme try again
[15:15:57] <dblosevn> well my code is entirely reliant on a delete button in the ui lol
[15:18:27] <kripster> ok, sorry, i prob havn't explained this good, so type in two words, on the press of space to start a third word you get the alert, so i got that done, then the field is disabled and can only be enabled by focusing on textfield and pressing delete, this will enable field and trim the last space, http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/123/
[15:19:21] <dblosevn> something like... $('yourtextbox selector').on('keyup', function() { var tmp = this.value.split(' '); if (tmp.length > 3) { this.value =  tmp[0] + ' ' + tmp[1]; } });
[15:19:59] <dblosevn> sorry if (tmp.value > 2)
[15:20:14] <dblosevn> grr wake up doug lol tmp.length > 2
[15:20:50] <kripster> ok so keycode for delete is 8, i think
[15:21:22] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/121
[15:21:35] <coldhead> lol doug
[15:21:54] <TonyDusk> can someone let me know if it possible to cycle thorugh these images as they are just by clicking big active image
[15:21:55] <TonyDusk> http://jsfiddle.net/TonyDusk/MWNWJ/1/
[15:22:03] <dblosevn> with that you dont need to test for the delete key although delete deletes a char after the cursor any ways backspace is the key you would listenn for
[15:22:27] <kripster> can you tell I'm a bit of a newbie to this lol
[15:22:47] <dblosevn> i basically wrote the code for you just fix the selector for the text field
[15:23:39] <kripster> o doug, i like, that makes more sense, don't let the user type on,am liking it, cheers
[15:23:48] <dblosevn> it should work just how it is with the proper selector
[15:24:15] <dblosevn> if they press backspace, it wont have more then 2 words and the user can type, if it has more then 2 words it removes the next one
[15:25:10] <dblosevn> actually that will stip the trailing space
[15:25:14] <kripster> great, cheers
[15:26:38] <dblosevn> this will work however leaving the trailing space intact http://dblosevn.chosd.com/122
[15:27:06] <dblosevn> otherwise when the user presses space the secon time it will strip the trailing space and make them append more chars to the second word
[15:27:22] <TelFiRE> is it at all reasonable to empty out all style attributes as a means of "resetting" whenever the user resizes their browser?
[15:28:14] <TelFiRE> or perhaps there's a better way. In the responsive world it seems it's pretty much completely unavoidable to have bugs when people switch views after engaging jquery so, just trying to find best resolution.
[15:29:14] <dblosevn> kripster: fiddlified it, http://jsfiddle.net/5sYyY/
[15:29:29] <TonyDusk> Was there a better way to run the function from the top than typing it again at line 18? --http://jsfiddle.net/TonyDusk/MWNWJ/1/
[15:31:25] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone -- what's the prefered graphing plugin these days?
[15:33:06] <shoky> DoctorMonocular: many people use flot
[15:33:15] <raj> hi shoky
[15:33:27] <shoky> ey raj. wusup
[15:33:48] <raj> i had super important questions for you last night and now totally don't remember
[15:34:04] <shoky> derp
[15:34:09] <shoky> doesn't sound important ;p
[15:40:02] <beachandbytes> DoctorMonocular also check out d3, nv3d
[15:41:11] <Wanfu> I have an iframe, and a contenteditable div in it. I can expand the width of the iframe checking iframe.contents().width compared to iframe.width().. but I cant contract it, bck to its normal size, if the text is removed.
[15:43:49] <adamsilver> why the alert never shows: http://bpaste.net/show/B8SomPz6q99s2qmRcd4z/ in this case while the item is being appended correctly?
[15:50:46] <sheilablackrose> is there a way to preload the images?
[15:50:49] <greg5green> adamsilver, I don't think it's your problem, but whats with your hatred of trailing semicolons
[15:51:49] <krz> how do i check if element has an attribute?
[15:52:06] <greg5green> actually adamsilver, you might be missing one too many semicolons
[15:52:39] <greg5green> })$('.remove_from_comparison').
[15:52:49] <greg5green> thats basically what you've written -- the whitespace means nothing
[15:53:04] <beachandbytes> if !($(this).attr('whatever) == 'undefined' || $(this)attr('whatever') == false)
[15:53:45] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[15:53:53] <greg5green> .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set
[15:54:29] <chilversc> beachandbytes: why 'undefined' rather than == null?
[15:54:41] <greg5green> you also would want !==, not !
[15:54:47] <greg5green> that only sort of made sense
[15:57:28] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/bsfPx/  - the image jumps when it first loads, than it works properly. any idea why this happens?
[15:57:33] <greg5green> http://jsfiddle.net/4mNUp/
[15:57:38] <greg5green> for you chilversc
[15:58:09] <greg5green> null does work instead of undefined, but I try to say what I mean, rather than what works
[15:58:18] <beachandbytes> greg5green I think some browsers return false
[15:58:27] <beachandbytes> I know my hasAttr code checks for both
[15:58:30] <beachandbytes> maybe thats been fixed now
[15:58:56] <greg5green> the documentation says undefined
[15:59:03] <greg5green> but im not about to fire up a VM to look in IE6
[15:59:04] <chilversc> greg5green: I prefer null, since undefined doesn't really exist as a value, it just happens to be a variable that isn't defined in most cases
[16:00:19] <greg5green> they are all 'falsey'
[16:01:10] <chilversc> greg5green: but you can do var undefined = 10; you can't do var null = 10; undefined doesn't actually exist as a language keyword, its just a variable
[16:01:19] <chilversc> hence why I don't like using undefined
[16:01:26] <greg5green> its reserved word
[16:01:46] <chilversc> yeah, but not actually enforced
[16:02:16] <greg5green> nm, im wrong, not a reserved word
[16:03:41] <greg5green> 			// Non-existent attributes return null, we normalize to undefined
[16:03:41] <greg5green> 			return ret == null ?
[16:03:41] <greg5green> 				undefined :
[16:03:42] <greg5green> 				ret;
[16:03:46] <greg5green> sorry, probably should have pasted somewhere
[16:04:30] <chilversc> greg5green: meh, I prefer to normalize to null
[16:04:51] <greg5green> well, you can make your case on github and contribute then :P
[16:04:57] <greg5green> i just pasted what the source says
[16:05:10] <chilversc> I'm not a fan of undefined, due to it not being protected in anyway
[16:05:46] <raj> is there an alternative to .trigger()?
[16:06:49] <chilversc> raj: why?
[16:06:59] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[16:09:16] <raj> cuz I want things like that streamlined, so I can do $('#selector').myPlugin('update') instead of $('#selector').trigger('update')
[16:09:33] <raj> i think most plugins do it like the former
[16:09:57] <raj> or maybe .myPlugin('option', 'update')
[16:10:02] <raj> or something like that, no?
[16:11:40] <chilversc> raj: then have a look at what those plugins do to support that?
[16:12:23] <chilversc> though I've never liked that style of widget, I don't know why they all do that since its far more awkward than being able to do; foo.update();
[16:14:10] <raj> chilversc, that is true as well, but whatever the standard is, I'd like to streamline such things
[16:15:02] <chilversc> raj: that's mostly just a case of having a; jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function() { ... }
[16:15:31] <chilversc> raj: though I'd look at existing widgets to see the pattern, iirc jquery docs and jquery ui docs have examples somewhere
[16:16:35] <raj> jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function() {...} allows for $('#selector').myPlugin(), not $('#select').update(), no?
[16:16:46] <raj> there has to be specific code int hat function to allow for .update()
[16:17:40] <raj> also, can I scope the namespace so it's .trigger('update.myPlugin')?
[16:20:36] <glaksmono> is there a way to detect if the CSS overflow is being applied to a DOM?
[16:20:58] <coldhead> not easily i don't think, glaksmono
[16:21:51] <coldhead> the only way i've ever managed it is by comparing the width of cloned elements with width:autp
[16:21:54] <coldhead> auto*
[16:21:57] <coldhead> a la http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4560083/css-overflow-detection-in-javascript
[16:22:04] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[16:25:17] <gener1c> i made js add jquery mobile and its classes only under a certain window width
[16:25:23] <gener1c> is that wise?
[16:29:41] <anthonydispezio> I've got an issue where .html (innerHTML) is not updating on safari mobile
[16:29:57] <dogarrhea> is it safe to say that any double slash (except when its next to a valid protocol like http:) is invalid in urls?
[16:31:14] <anthonydispezio> More accurately, the content is updating, but safari isn't painting the new content until after i trigger a transformation of the element
[16:31:27] <anthonydispezio> any advice?
[16:33:59] <chilversc> dogarrhea: nope, you could have; "//example.org/page.html"
[16:34:30] <chilversc> dogarrhea: though seeing a // not at the start or after a : is probably an error in most protocols
[16:34:50] <chilversc> dogarrhea: technically anything after the schema:// is implementation specific to the schema
[16:35:06] <say2joe1> it does work, however. i run across it a lot with people writing bad URLs for require (AMD module loading)
[16:35:25] <chilversc> ah, technically everything after schema: even
[16:35:42] <say2joe1> i'll see something like: baseDir//js/myapp/main.js and it does work… but it looks bad.
[16:36:17] <dogarrhea> hrm
[16:36:30] <dogarrhea> yea i'm dealing with a link with a // in it and it's a 404
[16:36:40] <chilversc> dogarrhea: though if you only care about http can't you check for; http:// https:// and just //
[16:36:42] <dogarrhea> somehow this URL was constructed and a double slash got in where it's supposed to be
[16:37:05] <dogarrhea> was thinking about replacing every "//" with "/" while there are still "//" in the string and then figuring out the exceptions to this rule
[16:37:17] <chilversc> dogarrhea: probably something like; var root = 'foo/'; var path = root + '/test.html';
[16:37:36] <dogarrhea> that is probably how it happened
[16:38:51] <chilversc> dogarrhea: its difficult though, since '//example.org/test.html' is supposed to be like that, while '//foo.html' is a mistake
[16:39:33] <coldhead> this example.org site is pretty cool
[16:40:05] <chilversc> coldhead: its part of the IANA reseved names, specifically for that purpose
[16:40:14] <chilversc> you can also use the .example tld
[16:40:43] <coldhead> cool! TIL

[16:46:00] <raj> how can I tell if tablesorter plugin has been initialized? http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs
[16:48:26] <shoky> raj:  log the element's .data() in the console
[16:49:38] <shoky> raj: there's also an 'initialized' event
[16:51:39] <dblosevn> http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
[16:51:58] <coldhead> cheers doug!
[16:52:55] <dblosevn> :-)
[16:54:51] <ansikt> What's the best way to organize my events?  I really like the way that Backbone does it, but I'd love to do it with regular jQuery events/objects.
[17:03:47] <ansikt> Like, what do most of you do on your projects?  Just have a pile of $(selector).on('event', functionName()) at the top of your document?
[17:04:07] <beachandbytes> if I am going to be ajaxing in a ton of events probably
[17:04:38] <coldhead> ansikt: i just refactored some code so taht there is a bunch of .on('thing', someFn) oneliners at the top
[17:04:52] <coldhead> and a bunch of someFn definitions further down
[17:04:56] <coldhead> that's proving pretty readable
[17:05:17] <beachandbytes> i might try that to make code more conscise at the top
[17:05:41] <coldhead> it's nice having all the event bindings in one place
[17:05:43] <coldhead> if you have a lot
[17:06:17] <mg983> Hey guys, I can't figure out what is causing this issue in chrome. Go to this site http://native.matgargano.com/, click on blog scroll to the bottom and click next, I use ajax to refresh content… however once the ajax refresh takes place and I scroll to the bottom, I get a huge whitespace at the bottom… this doesn't happen in FF, just chrome...
[17:06:19] <ansikt> That's what I'm doing too, but then I saw how backbone does it (http://backbonejs.org/#Events), and I've started longing for something that clean and organized.
[17:06:38] <mg983> backbone is great
[17:06:50] <coldhead> ansikt: so just use backbone? :P
[17:07:37] <tw2113> mmm bones
[17:07:45] <ansikt> It seems a little heavy of an architecture to adopt, especially since there's only maybe three pages on my project which have more then 10 events.
[17:08:06] <mg983> but you'll learn a new technology
[17:09:27] <coldhead> i have used backbone for really trivially light projects with a bare handful of events
[17:09:33] <coldhead> with no regrets
[17:09:47] <ansikt> mg983:  That's true.  Also, don't know what's causing your issue yet, but I just wanna say that that's a really sexy design.
[17:09:58] <greg5green> ansikt, you could just try to rip out the parts you need of backbone
[17:10:10] <mg983> ansikt: thanks I appreciate the kind words :)
[17:11:12] <mg983> I think my dog is far more intelligent than me...
[17:11:52] <coldhead> you probably have a richer inner life, mg983
[17:11:55] <coldhead> probably
[17:12:01] <mg983> i hope so
[17:12:07] <mg983> he has a great life though
[17:12:08] <ansikt> mg983:  I think you're just too low on the page when you do the ajax call, and the browser for some reason isn't seeing it as a page resize...try making the user scroll back up to the top of the post after the ajax call.
[17:12:15] <greg5green> I was going to say "backbone is only like 4kB isnt it?"
[17:12:20] <greg5green> then I remembered, oh, I'm thinking of underscore
[17:12:22] <greg5green> :(
[17:12:30] <mg983> ansikt: the designer wont like that :(
[17:14:10] <say2joe1> backbone is only 6.3k packed and zipped
[17:14:15] <ansikt> mg983:  Ah, not your own site?  Try changing that padding bottom on .section#blog .inner.
[17:14:35] <mg983> I am working with a designer
[17:14:37] <mg983> to put it together
[17:14:43] <ansikt> say2joel:  I didn't mean the resource is too big, just that the methodology would be a lot to adopt.
[17:15:20] <mg983> designer happens to be the worst kind… a family member :P
[17:15:30] <coldhead> ew
[17:15:46] <ansikt> mg983: change the padding bottom to margin bottom.  That fixes the problem for me.
[17:15:50] <mg983> Amazing
[17:15:52] <mg983> thanks
[17:15:54] <mg983> let's see
[17:16:09] <say2joe1> oh yeah…. good "learning curve" on that one. just built out toyota.com using it. unfortunately, different people use backbone differently depending on their level of knowledge.
[17:17:28] <mg983> ansikt: not for me :(
[17:17:37] <greg5green> yeah, that doesnt work here either
[17:18:45] <mg983> it must be something simple
[17:19:27] <ansikt> Really?  Worked for me.  Does opening and closing the inspector work for you?
[17:19:32] <greg5green> did you try not setting a height/min-height on .section
[17:19:36] <gener1c> if i get a type error from jquery mobile on ff on my desktop
[17:19:45] <mg983> greg5green, let me se
[17:19:49] <gener1c> is that normal?
[17:19:51] <greg5green> it breaks some other things when I do that, but it fixes that issue
[17:19:52] <mg983> ansikt: yeah
[17:20:00] <ansikt> generic:  It's using noconflict.  Use jQuery(whatever) instead of $(whatever)
[17:20:14] <gener1c> oh k
[17:20:21] <mg983> yeah i always use noconflict
[17:20:24] <mg983> i'm a pacifist :P
[17:20:44] <greg5green> ansikt, it didn't work here either. It got rid of the white spot immediately and stayed away if you opened and closed the inspector, but as soon as you hit prev or next, it was messed up again
[17:21:00] <coldhead> protip: don't call a property "quiescent" if you're working with people who don't read
[17:21:00] <gener1c> because i got cannot convert undefined to object
[17:21:28] <mg983> greg5green: let me try the minheight
[17:21:29] <raj> shoky, how did you find that there's an initialized event?
[17:21:44] <mg983> greg5green: removing mi-height didnt fix anything :\
[17:21:51] <greg5green> mg983, you are setting each section to be 100% tall
[17:22:02] <greg5green> whereas you just want them to stack on top of each other
[17:22:07] <shoky> raj: you linked to the docs ;]
[17:22:28] <mg983> greg5green: brilliant!
[17:23:08] <greg5green> fix?
[17:23:11] <coldhead> greg5green++
[17:23:13] <mg983> yessir
[17:23:22] <gener1c> well same error
[17:23:22] <raj> i didn't see any initialized event there
[17:23:26] <mg983> oy
[17:23:26] <raj> shoky, ^^
[17:23:33] <gener1c> ansikt: same error
[17:23:41] <shoky> raj: which events DID you see?
[17:23:53] <greg5green> Ah good. I dont get to write much css at work anymore, it's hard to look at problems for it now :(
[17:23:53] <ansikt> mg983:  Your html is for some reason 0px tall.  Make sure all it is cleared
[17:23:56] <gener1c> ansikt:   jQuery.getScript('http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.min.js',function(){
[17:23:59] <gener1c>                 console.log('loaded mobile');
[17:24:03] <raj> wtf
[17:24:04] <raj> i see it now
[17:24:09] <gener1c> i get loaded mobile but after that im fucked
[17:24:12] <shoky> ;D
[17:24:12] <raj> how did I not see that and I ctrl+f'd for initial
[17:24:23] <gener1c> can't convert undefined to object
[17:24:25] <ansikt> gener1c:  jQuery is already on the page.
[17:24:30] <raj> oh, but it doesn't return true/false
[17:24:37] <shoky> it's an event
[17:24:38] <raj> gotcha
[17:24:38] <gener1c> not jquery mobile
[17:24:49] <ansikt> From my console: jQuery().jquery   "1.7.2"
[17:24:59] <raj> shoky, remember that box thing had to be turned off for some jquery plugins
[17:25:00] <raj> ?
[17:25:06] <raj> so box is included in width
[17:25:11] <raj> i mean borders
[17:25:12] <shoky> raj: box-sizing?
[17:25:15] <raj> yeah
[17:25:19] <mg983> ansikt: thanks
[17:25:30] <raj> i'm trying to find where in my css I turned it off
[17:25:41] <gener1c> i dont understand ansikt
[17:25:42] <raj> cuz I think this plugin is mis-calculating due to it
[17:25:47] <raj> for column resizing
[17:25:53] <gener1c> you mean that inside jquery mobile theres jquery?
[17:26:09] <shoky> raj adunno
[17:26:19] <raj> how do I turn it off again?
[17:26:26] <raj> for an element
[17:26:35] <shoky> mmm
[17:28:28] <raj> oh, found it
[17:28:35] <raj> normalize.css
[17:28:40] <raj> content-box instead
[17:28:41] <gener1c> anyways i get this error
[17:28:49] <gener1c> and its pissing me off
[17:31:44] <UberNeo> can anybody please help in converting $('#pointslist li').find('a').live('click',function() {   in a .on() as .live() is now removed from 1.9 ver
[17:31:49] <raj> wait, that wasn't it
[17:32:26] <raj> oh, found it, jquery-ui.custom.css
[17:32:35] <ansikt> UberNeo: $('html').on('click','#pointslist li a',function(){})
[17:37:02] <raj> ok, shoky, I'm getting NaN for `j` here https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/blob/master/js/jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js#L911
[17:37:05] <UberNeo> ansikt: :) thanks a lot .. works like charm .. so it means we can go to any level just by #pointslist li a
[17:37:56] <raj> ok, that's lazy, I'm debugging
[17:38:02] <ansikt> UberNeo, If I understand you, yes.
[17:50:48] <raj> how can I refresh the resizable widget for tablesorter? https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/blob/master/js/jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js#L854
[17:50:56] <raj> after changes happen to the table
[18:07:37] <iateadonut> i have an input box and i want it to do something when you hit enter when the cursor is in it
[18:07:58] <iateadonut> i can do .bind('submit', function...   only if it's within a <form>
[18:08:04] <iateadonut> is that what i ahve to do?
[18:11:30] <greg5green> when you are focused on the input box
[18:11:36] <greg5green> you could fire an event on keypress
[18:11:48] <greg5green> and check to see which key it is, and if its the enter key, run your function
[18:17:37] <iateadonut> greg5green, ok
[18:38:08] <veQue> are you guys aware of any speed cssing or jquerying or html5ing contests?

[18:55:23] <innociv> So.. How the hell do I animated background-position?  Everything that comes up on google points to a page for a plugin that no longer exists.
[19:00:52] <coldhead> innociv: is animate() not working out for you, as recommended here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5171080/jquery-animate-background-position ?
[19:01:05] <innociv> Nevermind I found another
[19:01:14] <innociv> Read on, coldhead :)
[19:01:28] <innociv> -x and -y aren't supported in Firefox or IE
[19:01:55] <shoky> innociv i recently used this  https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[19:02:26] <coldhead> animated background positions are excessive
[19:02:40] <coldhead> in fact, background images in general are taking things too far
[19:02:51] <coldhead> white background, black times new roman text
[19:02:55] <coldhead> why fight it

[19:50:13] <tw2113> accidental moments
[19:50:26] <tw2113> are you new or something coldhead ?
[19:51:13] <coldhead> it's my first day
[19:51:26] <coldhead> i am still trying to learn #jQuery's strange and beautiful culture
[19:52:54] <tw2113> it's all about the $
[19:52:56] <tw2113> duh
[19:53:12] <coldhead> i notice that mootools has a $$ function
[19:53:21] <coldhead> so i can only assume that mootools earns more dollars
[19:53:23] <tw2113> they printed money
[19:53:29] <tw2113> it's worth less
[19:53:34] <coldhead> oh right
[19:53:44] <tw2113> $.print()
[19:53:46] <coldhead> i don't care what it's worth, so long as i have a lot of it
[19:54:09] <coldhead> that's why i like greek drachmas
[19:56:02] <coldhead> lol currency
[19:56:40] <tw2113> isn't the internet curreny bacon anyway?
[19:56:57] <innociv> No it is +1s

[19:57:35] <solarflares> i will give you 4 bacons for 7 jQueries
[19:57:37] <solarflares> thick cut
[19:58:01] <innociv> I got 3500 ups in a week of posting on reddit.  I'm internet rich and get all the girls on xvideos
[19:58:41] <coldhead> i probably don't want to know what xvideos is
[19:58:50] <innociv> I thought everyone knew.
[19:58:50] <coldhead> but i am happy for your success
[19:58:54] <innociv> I don't want to just say youporn
[19:59:13] <solarflares> xvideo is common knowledge round these parts
[19:59:23] <coldhead> those aren't the kinds of girls i would like
[19:59:36] <solarflares> why did you brag about getting with them then
[19:59:42] <coldhead> i like a girl with beautiful brown eyes and long flowing golden hair
[19:59:49] <coldhead> and a lolling tongue like a piece of ham
[19:59:49] <pzuraq> does anyone have experience with jsplumb?
[19:59:53] <coldhead> and big furry paws
[20:00:02] <solarflares> oh wait nvm lol mixed you two up coldhead
[20:00:03] <coldhead> actually the kind of girl i like is a golden retriever
[20:00:45] <solarflares> The kind of girl I like is greasy, with pepperoni tits, and cheese dripping off of her with a doughy crust
[20:01:22] <coldhead> that's the kind of girl my golden retriever girl likes too
[20:01:27] <tw2113> well, that escalated quickly
[20:01:28] <solarflares> so did you guys hear about the south african government spending like 15 million on a 40 dollar wordpress theme
[20:01:40] <coldhead> what a beautiful moment of international offensse to dogs, women and pizza
[20:01:52] <coldhead> no, that is awesome solarflares

[20:02:28] <solarflares> here is the site: http://www.freestateonline.fs.gov.za/
[20:02:53] <jayar> based on what page is open...
[20:03:29] <tw2113> perhaps check the url to the link href
[20:03:34] <tw2113> and if they match, add the class
[20:04:10] <jayar> hm
[20:04:16] <solarflares> i was going to say name the title and the link the same thing and compare the two
[20:04:26] <solarflares> but that is better
[20:05:20] <jayar> yea i like that
[20:06:25] <coldhead> way to be, irccloud
[20:07:22] <greg5green> this isnt that bad
[20:07:39] <greg5green> the ones on efnet back in the day would be bad enough to ping off those who didnt even split or anything
[20:07:47] <greg5green> just your stack overflowing with ping timeouts
[20:08:24] <coldhead> this is the best irc fail in history, is what i'm hearing
[20:08:33] <jayar> ermm.. so how do i check through the <li><a's to see which line to change? and then change just that one?
[20:09:19] <jayar> maybe i'll just take the nav out of the header include, and put it on each page seperately...
[20:10:23] <coldhead> this zambian site only cost 27911.48 US Dollar
[20:10:28] <coldhead> that's not so appalling
[20:10:33] <coldhead> i've charged more than that
[20:11:44] <greg5green> var currentPage = window.pathname; $('li a').each(function() { if ($(this).attr('href') == = currentPage) { $(this).addClass('current'); } } );
[20:11:48] <greg5green> err
[20:11:49] <greg5green> sorry,
[20:11:56] <greg5green> window.location.pathname if you are just doing relative paths
[20:12:00] <greg5green> so id be like
[20:12:15] <greg5green> "/index.html"
[20:12:17] <greg5green> itd*
[20:12:29] <greg5green> or "/this/is/my/path/page.html"
[20:12:35] <greg5green> window.location.href would be the whole hostname
[20:12:44] <greg5green> "http://example.com/this/is/my/path/index.html"
[20:13:18] <greg5green> that should be close, it not exactly what you need
[20:13:38] <greg5green> I work with dojo at work, so my jquery is getting a little rustier as i stop using it everyday
[20:13:46] <greg5green> close, if not***
[20:14:20] <jayar> so the each(function will loop till it finds a match?
[20:14:27] <jayar> that may work. thanx :)
[20:14:34] <greg5green> yes
[20:14:35] <jayar> i didnt think of that
[20:15:15] <coldhead> are you in ##dojo, greg5green ?
[20:15:20] <greg5green> just #dojo
[20:15:27] <coldhead> that's the one i was thinking of
[20:15:29] <coldhead> it's nicer than in here
[20:15:33] <coldhead> better kinds of people
[20:15:44] <coldhead> more intelligent
[20:15:46] <greg5green> a lot less people talking most of the time though
[20:15:50] <coldhead> more flawless skin
[20:15:52] <greg5green> but people actually know what they are asking about
[20:15:58] <coldhead> yes
[20:16:02] <greg5green> and arent as snarky when you try to help them
[20:16:09] <greg5green> (most people here arent either, but it happens)
[20:16:18] <coldhead> not just people who are like "it's my first day, shut up, you don't understand my needs"
[20:16:36] <greg5green> its more like asking a coworker in there
[20:17:32] <coldhead> depends on the quality of your cow orkers!
[20:17:55] <greg5green> touché
[20:18:14] <greg5green> After working with dojo on a daily basis though, I still miss jquery
[20:18:34] <greg5green> like
[20:19:02] <greg5green> on(query(".class"), ".anotherClass:click", function() { return; } ) ); just seems so messy
[20:19:14] <coldhead> jquery will always have its niche for making it easy to do things quickly
[20:19:20] <greg5green> I think I have one too many ) there
[20:19:37] <coldhead> it's okay, we're not evaluating your code
[20:19:50] <coldhead> if we were we'd be like "on() is not defined"
[20:20:05] <greg5green> it'd be silly to do event delegation and then just return anyways :P
[20:20:32] <greg5green> I thought the channel defined everything for me at the top?
[20:20:33] <coldhead> stranger things
[20:20:37] <coldhead> hahahah
[20:20:40] <coldhead> maybe it does
[20:20:54] <dblosevn> anythings possible
[20:21:05] <coldhead> if only i had the energy to post a bug report WHY IS $.BROWSER UNDEFINED IN #jQUERY
[20:21:24] <dblosevn> becuase it was removed in 1.9 @ coldhead
[20:21:58] <coldhead> BUT IT BROKE ALL MY CODE ETC
[20:21:59] <dblosevn> and $.BROWSER was never defined in jquery however $.browser was
[20:22:13] <greg5green> version deprecated: 1.3, removed: 1.9
[20:22:14] <ansikt> greg5green:  I thought dojo used the same selector engine?
[20:22:14] <greg5green> lol
[20:22:15] <dblosevn> then use migrate
[20:22:29] <greg5green> ansikt, you can set it up to use sizzle, but it doesn't by default
[20:22:31] <dblosevn> ? jquery migrate @ coldhead
[20:22:43] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery Core 1.9 Upgrade Guide | jQuery - jQuery 1.9 removes or modifies several APIs that behaved inconsistently or inefficiently in the past. The majority of these changes have been foreshadowed by their deprecation in previous versions ... http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[20:23:03] <greg5green> and even when you set it up that way, it still would use different synatx
[20:23:07] <greg5green> syntax*
[20:24:03] <greg5green> of course, you could write that was query(".class").on("click", functionetcetc):
[20:24:31] <greg5green> but i should probably stop talking about other libraries before everyone gets mad that im ruining the signal to noise ratio
[20:24:45] <dblosevn> coldhead: you should test for feature support rather then what browser is being used :-)
[20:25:27] <coldhead> nah i'm just going to use 1.8 until i die
[20:25:40] <greg5green> Did you just bazinga us?
[20:25:57] <coldhead> who even knows, man
[20:26:02] <coldhead> in real life i use jquery 1.6
[20:26:39] <dblosevn> i made the jump to 1.9, and just eliminated the need for migrate about 2 weeks ago
[20:27:55] <solarflares> sometimes i find myself after fixing bugs at work all day getting on IRC and fixing other people's bugs and then bedtime rolls around and i forgot to eat dinner
[20:28:07] <tw2113> solarflares, eat food
[20:28:17] <greg5green> I almost had that problem earlier
[20:28:18] <greg5green> got home
[20:28:21] <tw2113> $('#solarflares').nom()
[20:28:21] <greg5green> and BOOM it was 9pm
[20:28:26] <dblosevn> or call a hooker to feed you while you fix our bugs :-)
[20:28:32] <solarflares> lol
[20:28:45] <solarflares> PUT IT MY MOUTH
[20:28:49] <greg5green> shouldnt the people of #jquery pay for the hooker?
[20:28:50] <dblosevn> lmao
[20:29:01] <dblosevn> I would think that would be fair
[20:29:10] <greg5green> 1 fix = 1 hour
[20:29:22] <solarflares> what kind of hooker
[20:29:24] <dblosevn> ill build the site for collecting the domations for 30%
[20:29:30] <greg5green> depends on how impressive your fix is :P
[20:29:31] <coldhead> i don't think #jQuery really endorses slavery
[20:29:34] <dblosevn> *donations
[20:29:38] <tw2113> $('#solarflares').nom().inMouth();
[20:29:51] <dblosevn> its not slavery if she gettin paid
[20:30:54] <coldhead> mmm, qualms
[20:31:03] <greg5green> now that is a very deep philosophical look at the sex industry that I don't think is on topic
[20:31:18] <solarflares> mmm pokemon white
[20:31:43] <dblosevn> dang i thought hookers were always on topic :-(
[20:31:46] <coldhead> even just "sex" or "industry" is too big to grapple with
[20:32:14] <greg5green> anyone check out resig's new book yet?
[20:32:16] <greg5green> is it any good?
[20:32:30] <coldhead> tw2113 is reading it
[20:32:50] <tw2113> if you want to get down to fundamentals, read it
[20:32:58] <greg5green> manning keeps sending me coupon codes, but i am so bad at getting thru books
[20:33:06] <greg5green> it would be fifth or sixth in my queue
[20:33:11] <tw2113> chapters 3-4 just on functions
[20:33:23] <greg5green> this is the ninja one?
[20:33:31] <tw2113> yup
[20:33:41] <solarflares> ok ill buy
[20:33:44] <solarflares> u convinced me
[20:33:52] <ansikt> Just got that book free today, actually.
[20:33:58] <ansikt> weird how that happens...
[20:33:59] <greg5green> I had forgetten about it until I read his article about setTimeout and setInterval yesterday
[20:34:05] <greg5green> while grappling with event bubbling
[20:34:24] <greg5green> (which i guess is in the book)
[20:34:31] <solarflares> john resig here is 22 of my dollars for you which im sure you'll see not too much of
[20:34:36] <coldhead> he's a good writer
[20:34:41] <tw2113> like i said, you'll get down to fundamentals of javascript, and ideally you'll be able to see it in action with any other code you read, not just jquery
[20:34:51] <coldhead> jquery's api is substantially as he originall designed it
[20:34:59] <coldhead> bang up job there, john
[20:35:18] <tw2113> chapter 5 is closures
[20:35:29] <tw2113> it's next for me
[20:35:34] <coldhead> good luck with that
[20:35:47] <coldhead> i will cherish your pearls of closure wisdom
[20:35:52] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:36:04] <solarflares> i saw people slobbering over a closure explanation earlier
[20:36:06] <solarflares> let me find it
[20:36:10] <greg5green> I love reading about closures because every author tries to choose the most complicated thing you could do
[20:36:22] <greg5green> and in reality, im writing the most basic ones of all time
[20:36:31] <solarflares> http://web.archive.org/web/20080209105120/http://blog.morrisjohns.com/javascript_closures_for_dummies
[20:36:56] <solarflares> some OG shit if you have to use web archive to look at it
[20:37:11] <solarflares> aw 2008
[20:37:12] <solarflares> wtf
[20:38:40] <tw2113> greg5green, 5 ways to invoke a function...and go
[20:40:33] <tw2113> how about coldhead ?
[20:40:46] <solarflares> lol i bought it
[20:41:10] <greg5green> apply, call, map
[20:41:26] <greg5green> just running it?
[20:41:33] <greg5green> asking for the return to set a variable?
[20:41:37] <greg5green> idk about the last two
[20:41:46] <tw2113> according to the book: as a function, as a method, as a constructor, with apply(), with call()
[20:42:06] <coldhead> damn i was just hitting the logs up to get the correct answers from last time
[20:42:12] <coldhead> ALL FOR NOTHING
[20:42:19] <tw2113> :)
[20:42:52] <greg5green> close enough for me
[20:42:59] <greg5green> ill call it a victory for 11:45 on a monday
[20:43:18] <greg5green> those two ipas made me kind of sleepy
[20:43:43] <tw2113> first round or two of brew puts me to sleep too
[20:43:49] <tw2113> so i can't fault you there
[20:43:52] <greg5green> I was tired when I got home
[20:44:02] <greg5green> I could have gone to bed right then and there
[20:44:09] <greg5green> but who goes to bed at 6:30?
[20:45:07] <coldhead> old people
[20:45:08] <coldhead> me
[20:45:43] <tw2113> coldhead is in bed right now
[20:45:43] <greg5green> i'm still 27 for another 10 days and damnit, im going to stay up later than 630 on all of them!
[20:46:10] <coldhead> 27 is too young to be allowed on the internet unsupervised
[20:46:13] <coldhead> if it were up to me
[20:46:17] <coldhead> fortunately for you it's not
[20:47:04] <greg5green> I can't believe my mom let me stay up this late on a school night
[20:47:15] <tw2113> drinking no less
[20:47:47] <greg5green> shes going to be so pissed when she finds those beer bottles
[20:48:08] <greg5green> im not going to be able to be able to come on irc for weeks
[20:49:14] <solarflares> okay there is a new show about vikings
[20:49:27] <greg5green> on the "history" channel
[20:49:47] <solarflares> is that the channel its on?
[20:50:00] <greg5green> yes
[20:50:24] <coldhead> i have read tweets about that
[20:50:28] <coldhead> i understand it is ivery violent
[20:50:34] <coldhead> and glorifies vikings
[20:50:37] <coldhead> which they sorely needed
[20:50:49] <solarflares> okay ill have a watch
[20:51:13] <solarflares> its gonna be like spartacus probably except maybe less sex
[20:51:25] <coldhead> A++
[20:51:58] <solarflares> you know which show I really liked that ended too soon was Rome
[20:52:59] <ansikt> Rome was probably the most historically accurate sword-n-sandal show/movie to date.  Shame that it ended so early.
[20:53:07] <solarflares> yeah
[20:53:09] <solarflares> i loved it
[20:53:31] <coldhead> the sand was good
[20:53:37] <coldhead> i think they really captured the sand
[20:53:40] <solarflares> however if you're looking for a tv show that essentially picks up where rome ended
[20:53:46] <solarflares> and is really really good
[20:53:50] <solarflares> and made like 30 years prior
[20:54:08] <solarflares> BBC made a miniseries depiction of that book I Claudius
[20:54:30] <solarflares> which begins with augustus
[20:54:34] <ansikt> Titus Pullo and Lucius Verinus were real characters from that Bello Gallo too, and pretty much described as in the show.
[20:54:57] <solarflares> yeah there were in ceasers commentaries i think
[20:55:00] <solarflares> they*
[20:55:01] <coldhead> this is some seriously detailed tv-shows-about-rome knowledge you are dropping here
[20:55:16] <solarflares> im a history slut
[20:55:43] <coldhead> respect
[20:56:27] <solarflares> I, Claudius is actually a book written by robert graves which is an EXTREMELY historically accurate fictional depiction of interpersonal events perceived through the eyes of Claudius
[20:56:57] <solarflares> so baically events are accurate, dialogue is fabricated (mostly)
[20:57:30] <solarflares> oh
[20:57:35] <solarflares> and patrick stewart is in it
[20:57:57] <ansikt> We have so little written record of the Romans (considering how much shit they actually wrote), that it's really no surprise that we can't get dialogue.
[20:58:27] <solarflares> yeah I guess its implied the dialogue is fabricated
[21:00:24] <solarflares> anyways the premise of the book is that claudius has a club foot and stutters and nobody thinks anything of him so he essentially goes unnoticed and with that comes a lot of insight
[21:04:13] <ansikt> Hm.  I should check it out, I don't remember the last time I read a book for entertainment
[21:06:54] <solarflares> i bought a kindle and it made me read a lot more
[21:07:08] <solarflares> it was like ILL KILL YOUR DOG IF YOU DONT READ
[21:07:50] <greg5green> strange, my ipad just makes me want to be on twitter
[21:13:23] <coldhead> ?fweep
[21:13:23] <bot-t> coldhead, SCHLOOT
[21:13:28] <ansikt> I have a nook, but I always have something I have to read for work or school, so I never read fantasy or historical fiction or whatever.
[21:13:29] <coldhead> welcome back, ircclouders
[21:25:11] <solarflares> look at these vikings
[21:27:13] <solarflares> look at my ascii cam
[21:40:18] <solarflares> mmm bacon
[21:41:59] <solarflares> if you guys buy your bacon packaged i recommend going to a butcher and buying it there cause you can often times get it cheaper AND its super thick and yummy
[21:42:08] <ShamanIotasTook> ok, i've tried everything, anyway to update a tootltip title?
[21:42:42] <ShamanIotasTook> $(el).data('tooltip').getTip().html(title) ; didn't work
[21:42:51] <ShamanIotasTook> $(el).prop('tooltipText', title); didn't work
[21:42:59] <ShamanIotasTook> $(el).attr('tooltipText', title); didn't work
[21:43:12] <ShamanIotasTook> and yes....mmmmmm.bacon!
[21:44:24] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: $(el).tooltip('option', 'content', title);
[21:45:25] <ShamanIotasTook> SWEET! thanks cork! you helped me before...you're always here helping! wish i could give you a donut
[21:45:57] <tw2113> he doesn't need a donut
[21:45:59] <tw2113> he's on a diet
[21:46:09] <tw2113> give him $2 though
[21:46:33] <Cork> O_o
[21:46:43] <ShamanIotasTook> too bad there isn't an IRC 'tip' button!
[21:46:50] <tw2113> he's almost worked off all the YUI weight
[21:47:05] <tw2113> it's called "what's your paypal email"
[21:49:55] <coldhead> chunkylover69@aol.com
[21:50:05] <Cork> <_<'
[21:53:18] <solarflares> thats usually my opening line with a girl too
[21:54:32] <ShamanIotasTook> worked perfectly
[21:58:54] <ezio> look at this gem on a concert venue site
[21:58:59] <ezio> onBlur="this.value=!this.value?'Message':this.value;"
[21:59:05] <ezio> and it's full of this shit
[22:19:52] <solarflares> mmm payday tomorrow
[22:41:39] <relipse>  does anyone want to discuss the love of Jesus Christ in the bible?
[22:46:07] <pehlert> Good morning folks. I have just realized that offset().top loses precision (returns too much) the further down the page I get.. Is this a known issue?
[22:46:24] <pehlert> "I get" = "the element is located".. Sorry
[22:46:59] <Cork> pehlert: you prob want .position() instead of .offset()
[22:47:33] <pehlert> Cork: I use it for scrolling, so offset() should be the right tool I think
[22:48:06] <Cork> pehlert: position() gives you the offset to the closest offset parent
[22:48:08] <pehlert> Wait, I just realized that it doesn't happen on every page load.. That's strange
[22:48:16] <Cork> offset gives you the offset to the document top
[22:48:21] <Cork> so no i think you want position()
[22:48:56] <pehlert> Cork: I use it to scroll to a particular element on the page, so I need to offset from the document top to use it with scrollTop (if not mistaken)
[22:49:17] <Cork> ah, ya
[22:49:52] <Cork> as long as the scroll is on the document that is
[22:50:17] <pehlert> Yes, it is ;-)
[22:50:23] <pehlert> But it's a weird issue, it seems to only happen when I do a full page reload (sorry, noticed that a bit late)
[22:50:35] <pehlert> Very odd
[22:50:46] <Cork> see if you can reproduce it in a testcase
[22:51:00] <Cork> (a small page where you remove as much logic as possible)
[22:52:44] <pehlert> Cork: I'll try to if there is no other way. (It's a rather complex page and I doubt, that I will be able to reproduce the issue in a stripped down version)
[22:53:40] <Cork> pehlert: when you get intermittent errors, and have a complex page
[22:53:47] <abby_j> anyone experience issues with radio buttons and jquery?
[22:53:58] <Cork> its normally the fastest and almost only way to reduce the complex to try to find what happens
[22:54:12] <Cork> abby_j: you need to be more specific
[22:54:42] <abby_j> well I have code that works with 1 set of radio buttons (the yes buttons), but the same code does not work for the No buttons
[22:55:04] <Cork> abby_j: sounds like you have a logic error somewhere
[22:55:12] <Cork> ?p @ abby_j
[22:55:13] <bot-t> abby_j, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:55:36] <pehlert> Cork: I totally agree, I'll just give something else a try at first
[22:55:48] <abby_j> sure one moment please
[22:59:23] <abby_j> okay, how odd, I plug it into the jsfiddle, and the code works fine
[22:59:40] <abby_j> it just doesn't work on my local site :(
[22:59:50] <Cork> go through your page and make sure you don't have anything interfering with your code
[23:00:06] <Cork> list duplicate id's, or another code section
[23:01:09] <abby_j> doesn't appear to have duplicat ids
[23:01:28] <Cork> then show the jsfiddle and we might find something
[23:02:30] <abby_j> http://jsfiddle.net/qFYb2/
[23:02:48] <abby_j> the bottom of the javascript section -- you can flip the 1 to 0 and it appears to work there
[23:03:32] <Cork> where are you calling updateFieldValue in your page?
[23:03:48] <abby_j> from a returning ajax call
[23:04:00] <abby_j> but on the jsfiddle, it's the bottom of the javascript section
[23:04:04] <Cork> and your sure the element exists in the page when your calling the function?
[23:04:14] <abby_j> (nods)
[23:04:23] <abby_j> that's basically the code that I ripped from the page
[23:04:28] <Cork> so $('#' + field).length > 0 ?
[23:04:52] <abby_j> yep -- I can run an is(checked) on it, and it evaluates the field fine
[23:05:00] <abby_j> (and a value on it as well)
[23:05:20] <Cork> ah wait
[23:05:34] <Cork> your using attr the wrong way (why do ppl keep doing this)
[23:05:38] <Cork> attr is for attributes
[23:05:43] <abby_j> (nods)
[23:05:53] <Cork> and your aiming to modify the property so you should be using prop
[23:06:03] <Cork> attr('checked', false) means nothing
[23:06:04] <abby_j> so it should be .checked = true
[23:06:08] <Cork> no
[23:06:13] <Cork> prop('checked', true)
[23:06:20] <Cork> attr isn't meant for it
[23:06:22] <abby_j> prop not attr?
[23:06:27] <Cork> ?.prop
[23:06:27] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[23:06:35] <Cork> ?.attr
[23:06:35] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[23:06:51] <abby_j> one second please :)
[23:08:15] <abby_j> OHHH THANK YOU!!
[23:08:31] <abby_j> all of the help pages I went to kept referencing attr
[23:08:47] <rainabba> I just upgraded to jQuery 1.8.1 and ui 1.10.1 and suddenly my .autocomplete() is calling mypage.aspx?query=foo, completely ignoring my url: setting in the ajax() call. Why? Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/nVPCE8hn
[23:10:54] <Cork> abby_j: attr was doing the job of both prop and attr up until 1.6
[23:11:04] <Cork> abby_j: so many pages refer to it wrongly
[23:11:35] <Cork> rainabba: are you sure the source function is used at all?
[23:11:39] <rainabba> Cork: When should one be used over the other? I never have had that clear in my head.
[23:11:55] <abby_j> Thank you for setting me straight
[23:12:00] <Cork> rainabba: if you want to access the attribute "on the html element" user attr
[23:12:02] <rainabba> Cork: Not really. Guess I could console.log to check but I didn't touch that code :(
[23:12:10] <Cork> if you want to access properties on the dom element use prop
[23:12:15] <rainabba> Ahh
[23:12:27] <rainabba> Makes sense
[23:12:41] <Cork> so prop will give you the browser modified values, while attr will give the raw value from the dom
[23:13:35] <Cork> ex.  <a href="page.html"></a> $('a').attr('href') == 'page.html'; $('a').prop('href') == 'http://www.example.com/full/path/page.html';
[23:13:47] <jaha> any ideas why ajax calls inside require-jquery.js dont work? no errors or anything, just stops on the ajax call
[23:14:10] <Cork> whats require-jquery.js?
[23:15:10] <jaha> nvm, i think it was a caching issues with the modules
[23:15:35] <jaha> Cork: its the require.js and jquery combined file (provided by require.js)
[23:15:39] <vladikoff> Cork, http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[23:15:47] <Cork> ah
[23:16:08] <Cork> then a tip say that in the question
[23:17:43] <rainabba> Cork: I'm not sure now. I know that autocomplete() is getting called but if I try console.log('Yeah, we\'re using the function!'); inside each of the source, focus, and select events (at the end, but before return in those that use it), I never see anything logged and the call to the page url?query is still made.
[23:22:32] <raj> is there a more jqueryish way to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/7668692/997624
[23:22:37] <raj> well, this way isn't jquery at all
[23:22:42] <raj> but is there a jquery way to?
[23:23:15] <raj> I have a div that contains some text and I want to know if that text goes outside the element (continues below the div)
[23:23:38] <Cork> you could write a plugin that does it for you
[23:24:01] <Cork> but no as far as i know there isn't a premade function for it
[23:25:44] <raj> ahha
[23:25:55] <raj> Cork, are you please with the way they did it?
[23:26:46] <Cork> it just checks if the scroll dimensions is larger then the element dimensions
[23:26:56] <Cork> don't see how you could check for overflow in another way
[23:27:24] <Cork> at least not that wouldn't break
[23:28:17] <raj> k
[23:28:29] <raj> thank you sir :)
[23:28:37] <Cork> so $(this).prop('scrollHeight') > $(this).height()
[23:29:15] <Cork> though that said, it will only react to if you have scrollable area
[23:29:38] <raj> it's not a scrollable element
[23:29:40] <Cork> not if things has been moved through position: absolute or transform or similar
[23:29:54] <Cork> if it has overflow it is
[23:30:00] <Cork> even if its overflow: hidden
[23:30:17] <raj> the container is a floated element
[23:30:30] <raj> with fixed height/width
[23:30:55] <Cork> well and you want to check ageist the containers parent?
[23:31:26] <raj> <div class='container'><p class='element'></p></div>
[23:31:26] <angelazou> hi, I have a javascript using fn, and it keeps telling me that fn is not defined
[23:31:32] <angelazou> jquery script is hooked, but it's still not showing
[23:31:32] <rainabba> Figured it out and now I'm going to slink away with my head down :)
[23:31:39] <rainabba> Take care all!
[23:31:43] <angelazou> the jquery I placed is 1.8.3
[23:31:53] <raj> angelazou, can you paste your code?
[23:31:59] <Cork> raj: if you want to check the overflow of the floating .container element; your still checking for an element with overflow
[23:32:11] <angelazou> html paste is available here http://fpaste.org/xdHb/ the jquery I placed is 1.8.3
[23:32:15] <angelazou> hooked at line 31
[23:32:30] <raj> Cork, so .container {overflow:hidden;} is okay?
[23:32:37] <Cork> sure
[23:32:46] <raj> oh ok, thought you said I needed scrollbars or something
[23:32:53] <Cork> your explicitly tells the container to be an overflow parent
[23:33:04] <Cork> raj: overflow: hidden can still be scrolled
[23:33:20] <raj> i thought that's overflow:auto;
[23:33:32] <Cork> overflow: visible is another matter
[23:33:42] <Cork> raj: auto or scroll just means the scrollbars are shown
[23:33:59] <Cork> everything beside visible will make it scrollable
[23:34:21] <Cork> angelazou: where are you using the .fn property?
[23:34:58] <angelazou> Cork: in a third-party script, the DT_bootstrap, load.js, and toggle-buttons are all complaining of the same error
[23:35:11] <raj> oh
[23:35:17] <Cork> angelazou: sounds like it triggers before jquery is loaded
[23:35:36] <angelazou> Cork: problem is, jquery is loaded at the header
[23:36:19] <angelazou> and from the network tab in the inspector, all these scripts are loaded after jquery
[23:36:39] <Tak0r|Work> hi guys
[23:36:57] <raj> Cork, would you make that simple little function a jquery extension or just leave it in plain js?
[23:37:10] <raj> as a named function
[23:37:20] <Cork> raj: depends on how often you need it
[23:37:31] <Tak0r|Work> i have a Problem with setting the value of a form field I pass some string to a disabled field and it show's up, but after submitting the form it's not there
[23:37:33] <raj> probably use it 2 or 3 times in my whole webapp
[23:37:36] <Tak0r|Work> any clue about this ?
[23:37:37] <Cork> for one or two occurrences; no
[23:37:59] <Cork> Tak0r|Work: disabled fields arn't submitted
[23:38:06] <raj> k
[23:39:31] <Tak0r|Work> ahh well that could be the problem :O
[23:40:38] <Tak0r|Work> well should have used readonly :O
[23:41:21] <Cork> Tak0r|Work: i think read only does the same
[23:41:39] <Cork> if it does, just make a copy to a type="hidden" field
[23:41:58] <Tak0r|Work> no readonly transmits
[23:41:58] <Cork> raj: about the scrolling btw http://jsfiddle.net/eDhT7/
[23:44:04] <raj> Cork, holy crap
[23:44:07] <raj> that's awesome
[23:44:11] <Cork> not really
[23:44:27] <Cork> just a hacky example to prove that overflow: hidden can scroll
[23:44:33] <raj> ooooh
[23:44:44] <raj> by scroll, I thought you meant scrollbars
[23:44:50] <raj> gotcha, gotcha
[23:45:09] <raj> like I can drag-highlight with my mouse to move up and down in the text
[23:45:17] <Cork> an awsome example would use requestAnimationFrame :)
[23:45:43] <Cork> but i'm too lazy
[23:46:57] <raj> dude, you made a cool looking example just to prove overflow:hidden can scroll
[23:46:58] <raj> :)
[23:47:04] <raj> who cares about exact timings of the scroll
[23:47:05] <raj> lol
[23:47:15] <Cork> heh
[23:47:30] <Cork> its just like 5 lines of native js
[23:47:34] <Cork> not exactly complex :)
[23:47:44] <raj> i know, i couldn't do that with 50 lines ;)
[23:49:59] <raj> hmm, I think I actually do wanna make this a jquery function
[23:50:07] <raj> in case I wanna use it more in the future too for other stuff
