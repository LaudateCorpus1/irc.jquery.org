[00:00:09] <greg5green> or if it wasnt ever run, there wont even be a blank line
[00:00:31] <jangoh> [13:06:28.797] ({length:0, prevObject:{0:({}), length:1, context:({})}, context:({}), selector:"label:contains(\"DELETE\")"})
[00:00:34] <jangoh> undefined
[00:00:58] <greg5green> try just label?
[00:01:08] <jangoh> yes
[00:04:25] <christoffer__> does jquery have a built-in broadcast (event) solution?
[00:05:15] <christoffer__> perhaps its the jQuery(document).trigger and .bind, hmm
[00:05:16] <jangoh> nm found it
[00:05:31] <jangoh> greg5green just got it .. missed a braces
[00:05:39] <greg5green> :)
[00:06:07] <jangoh> now i want to select checkboxes together
[00:06:12] <greg5green> christoffer__, jquery doesn't have a publisher/subscriber system as far as i know
[00:06:18] <jangoh> how to select 2 attr
[00:06:28] <christoffer__> greg5green, wouldnt jQuery(document).trigger work? o.O h
[00:07:11] <greg5green> it would work
[00:07:14] <greg5green> there may be pitfalls though
[00:07:50] <christoffer__> hm ok :-)
[00:08:14] <christoffer__> maybe i should just implement my own observer modle
[00:08:17] <christoffer__> pattern
[00:08:32] <jangoh> greg5green how do i select label text and checkboxes at same time?
[00:09:08] <jangoh> <tr><th><label for="id_course_name-0-DELETE">Delete:</label></th><td><input id="id_course_name-0-DELETE" name="course_name-0-DELETE" type="checkbox" />
[00:09:38] <greg5green> question
[00:09:57] <greg5green> are you only trying to target that specific label/input combo?
[00:10:20] <greg5green> christoffer__, there are a few out there already, so you might find one you like
[00:10:21] <jangoh> I want to select them and align or positioning them
[00:10:31] <greg5green> just those two elements though?
[00:10:35] <jangoh> ya
[00:10:35] <greg5green> not tons of other ones?
[00:10:49] <jangoh> 2 types
[00:10:58] <jangoh> there could be many
[00:11:02] <jangoh> like this
[00:11:03] <jangoh> :)
[00:11:27] <greg5green> well, you probably would be better off doing something like
[00:11:39] <greg5green> $('parent label, parent input')
[00:11:49] <greg5green> than this convoluted contains business
[00:12:18] <greg5green> but you can do multiple selectors in the same $('') bit if you separate them with a comma
[00:13:53] <akurilin> Any folks here with experience dealing with $.ajax error status codes? Could use some help here, if you have a sec: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17509717/jquery-returns-status-code-404-instead-of-403
[00:14:24] <jangoh> Ok thanx i will try it
[00:23:25] <SinnerNyx> akurilin: What's the url where I can create my own ajax call to and see what it gives me?
[00:24:21] <akurilin> SinnerNyx, sorry don't have one atm that's exactly like the one I'm calling locally
[00:24:38] <akurilin> SinnerNyx, does it look like it should work, at a quick glance at least?
[00:25:25] <SinnerNyx> akurilin: I'm really not an expert. Was just going to make doubly certain that it was a 403, and maybe do some testing with non-minified jquery to see where the issue might be.
[00:26:15] <akurilin> SinnerNyx, that's a pretty good idea, I'll give that a shot.
[00:26:26] <SinnerNyx> akurilin: good luck :)
[00:26:39] <akurilin> SinnerNyx, thanks for taking a look!
[00:26:46] <SinnerNyx> :)

[03:10:31] <kk_fosser> hello, I am trying to know the reason why my click event on a url does not get fired after my page loades.  Basically it's a static link to which the click event is associated, it works the first time but when the page is reloaded, it refuses to work.
[03:13:01] <ph88> sounds like a real mystery
[03:19:20] <kk_fosser> hello can some one tell me why the click event I associate with a static url does not work after a page reload.  it actually works the first time.
[03:51:34] <poseid> hi, how would I prepend items to a list: <article></article>â€¦<div class='actions'>more</div>
[03:51:47] <poseid> I want to prepend articles before the div?
[03:52:36] <poseid> i tried $(".actions").append("aaa")
[03:52:49] <hagb4rd> hey droogies.. what is the easiest / best practise way to copy a string to the clipboard?
[03:53:18] <poseid> and prepend("aaa")
[03:53:29] <poseid> both result into updating the innerhtml
[03:53:36] <poseid> of the last div
[03:54:30] <poseid> ah, .after(

[03:54:40] <dabear> hagb4rd: not possible with javascript
[03:54:54] <dabear> hagb4rd: you can if you use flash
[03:55:05] <dabear> but don't do it!(tm)
[03:55:08] <hagb4rd> would you recommend a solution?
[03:55:14] <dabear> yep
[03:55:19] <dabear> don't do it
[03:55:28] <hagb4rd> don't be funny like that
[03:55:31] <hagb4rd> lol
[03:55:34] <dabear> I am serious
[03:55:50] <hagb4rd> other opinions?
[03:55:51] <dabear> there's a reason it's not possible
[03:56:11] <hagb4rd> because there is no clipboard in my toaster?
[03:56:17] <dabear> why can't your users just ctrl+c it them selves?
[03:56:28] <hagb4rd> luxury
[03:56:33] <hagb4rd> usability
[03:56:34] <hagb4rd> speed
[03:57:05] <hagb4rd> shit..everything but 42
[03:57:37] <dabear> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400212/how-to-copy-to-the-clipboard-in-javascript
[03:58:01] <hagb4rd> have you used that one?
[03:58:06] <hagb4rd> yet
[03:58:35] <dabear> no, because a web page should never ever access the clipboard
[03:59:45] <hagb4rd> that's ok dabear.. i'll consider this ;) though you didn't mention the reasons.. it was not my old-fashioned-cliboardless-toaster
[03:59:54] <hagb4rd> so why not?
[04:00:00] <dabear> security?
[04:00:20] <dabear> what if every web page has access to my clipboard, and I just copied a password into my clipboard
[04:00:26] <dabear> wooopsi!
[04:00:52] <hagb4rd> that's why passwords are not copied out of password form fields
[04:00:59] <_rgn> err, wasn't it about writing to the clipboard, not reading it
[04:01:24] <hagb4rd> _rgn: is there a way of just writing using js?
[04:02:10] <hagb4rd> also, IE supports clipboard natively afaik
[04:02:21] <dabear> _rgn: hagb4rd; googleit :)
[04:02:23] <dabear> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7409900/what-makes-access-to-a-systems-clipboard-a-security-vulnerablility
[04:02:41] <hagb4rd> well well sure
[04:02:54] <hagb4rd> there is a risk..
[04:03:24] <_rgn> web page shouldn't be able to read the clipboard however it wants, other than that i don't see your point
[04:03:48] <dabear> yeah, and the point is, you're not the one who should decide if you can access the clipboard
[04:03:59] <dabear> it's the users privilege to do that

[08:00:00] <verism_> i'm at a total loss
[08:01:05] <boytoy> verism_: Sorry I don't know. You good with Isotope though? I kinda need some help with it as well.
[08:01:25] <verism_> nope - i suck at it
[08:01:28] <verism_> sorry
[08:01:50] <boytoy> Damn
[08:02:00] <verism_> i reckon if i get over this initial hurdle it should be easy enough to get to grips with
[08:03:23] <boytoy> Looks really deep.
[08:04:10] <boytoy> For what it's worth, here's mine. Lemme know if you can think of anything: Is there an easier way to do this Packery "click-to-see-photos-only" thing: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/ than to manipulate its HTML like that? Should be as easy turning it off as it is turning it on.
[08:07:49] <verism_> holy moly, packery looks nice
[08:08:18] <boytoy> indeed!
[08:15:55] <motaka2> hello in thcode jsdeffred doesnt make the js to come before html what should I do ?  http://jsfiddle.net/xPd79/
[08:28:22] <blez> is it possible to get the position of a text selection?
[08:29:34] <Anniepoo> I'm writing a jqueryui binding to the SWI-Prolog html generation framework.
[08:29:43] <Anniepoo> There are two strategies for using jqueryui;
[08:29:54] <Anniepoo> download the full version from the CDN and depend on browser caching to make that relatively painless
[08:30:01] <Anniepoo> or download a custom version that uses only what's necessary on this site.
[08:30:13] <Anniepoo> The first version vastly simplifies my own work as framework writer. Is it a reasonable approach?
[08:32:53] <motaka2> no one can answer my question?
[08:37:14] <Anniepoo> motaka - it's early morn on sunday in the US, on a holiday weekend.
[08:38:55] <motaka2> Anniepoo: :)
[08:39:02] <motaka2> dont you know the answer?
[08:39:06] <motaka2> I send a request to a url and i recive a json containing neccessary js and css files and also the html content, I want to make sure that first those js files are loaded and then I insert the html in the render area, and this is the code I am using, but some times it fails, and it seems that those external javascript files are loaded later...
[08:39:08] <motaka2> than the inserted html,  and here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/xPd79/
[08:39:42] <Anniepoo> I'll look. I'm a noob to jquery
[08:42:26] <Anniepoo> force caching off by adding a random number as a search param  to the script name. If the behavior then becomes consistently wrong it's due to caching
[08:44:14] <Anniepoo> 8c( afraid I know little of all this
[08:44:31] <motaka2> Anniepoo: I turned of caching using meta-s , so u think I have to turn of caching ?
[08:45:27] <Anniepoo>                     cache: true
[08:45:42] <Anniepoo> I'm just trying to simplify the issue
[08:45:52] <Anniepoo> can you serve the whole page here?
[08:46:06] <Anniepoo> can you serve the whole page somewhere?
[08:46:23] <Anniepoo> well - a demo version, not 8 zillion lines of dancing bunnies
[08:48:11] <motaka2> Anniepoo: I turned of caching and it didnt work at all!
[08:48:27] <Anniepoo> =8cO Maybe it's just borked!
[08:49:06] <Anniepoo> could be the URI moved and you're grabbing it from your cache - is it something common from a CDN?
[08:49:19] <motaka2> Anniepoo: i'll be ver difficult to make a test case
[08:49:37] <Anniepoo> =8cO There are difficult things in computing?
[08:49:39] <motaka2> have u seen my code? have used promises correctely ?
[08:49:55] <motaka2> have I ... ?*
[08:50:15] <Anniepoo> I'm making little sense of your code... told you I was jquery noob
[08:53:02] <Anniepoo> can you set up a couple php pages that serve the js and html only after a 10 sec delay so you can control the order?
[08:56:01] <Anniepoo> you might also use BurpSuite
[09:13:00] <RRR2> Are functions that are declared like this "function something(){}" can be used as objects and send as parameters?
[09:26:16] <Anniepoo> RR2 - yes - something is a variable like any other
[09:26:26] <Anniepoo> so you could do
[09:26:37] <Anniepoo> $(something);
[09:33:49] <Coin-coin> Hi guys
[09:34:45] <Coin-coin> http://pastebin.com/tzTn0RY1 Do I use placeholder.shim(); the right way?
[09:34:50] <Coin-coin> https://github.com/parndt/jquery-html5-placeholder-shim
[09:35:03] <Coin-coin> I execute it when I change a placeholder but it doesn't refresh them on IE
[09:38:22] <Auger> Coin-coin: I am not sure, but I would imagine you'd want to execute .shim() before you run your other code
[09:38:56] <Coin-coin> It's automatically executed a first time when I link the script on my page
[09:39:28] <Coin-coin> The placeholders work well on IE8, but they don't refresh when I use placerholder.ship() "manually" in my script :(
[09:40:38] <Auger> try putting that entire .change function outside the document ready function
[09:41:08] <Coin-coin> Doesn't work
[09:42:54] <Auger> is the html-placeholder-shim script linked in your head or at the bottom of the page
[09:43:38] <Auger> bleh, i just use modernizr :P
[09:44:05] <Auger> are you familiar with it?
[09:44:08] <Coin-coin> Bottom of the page :p
[09:44:11] <Coin-coin> No
[09:44:13] <Coin-coin> I heard of it
[09:44:22] <Coin-coin> But I'm not sure about what it is :)
[09:44:33] <Auger> modernizr is great
[09:45:05] <Auger> i'd say it's industry standard
[09:45:06] <Auger> http://modernizr.com/
[09:46:37] <Coin-coin> Is that some kind of magical script which could prevent me using multiple scripts to enable media queries or HTML5 tags on IE<9 ? :O
[09:48:01] <Auger> :D
[09:48:11] <Anniepoo> 8cD
[09:48:48] <Auger> life used to be hard before modernizr
[09:50:06] <george_> how do i ignore a particular data attribute when listing all the data attributes of an element using FOR ?

[09:51:08] <RRR2> continue;*
[09:57:50] <Coin-coin> I'll look into it Auger, thanks :)
[09:58:20] <Auger> sure thing
[09:59:07] <boytoy> Is there an easier way to do this Packery "click-to-see-photos-only" thing: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/ other than to manipulate its HTML like that?
[10:01:05] <george_> any help greatly appreciated :)
[10:02:08] <shoky> george_: how are you listing them
[10:03:11] <george_> hey shoky, they're listed like so http://codepen.io/piers/pen/cFyDB
[10:03:28] <shoky> i believe RRR2 was answering your question
[10:04:01] <shoky> george_: also you should know that you might get stuff that are not data-attributes using .data() like that
[10:06:31] <george_> i know i need to use IF, but i need to filter out the ones i dont want
[10:06:51] <george_> would u recommend using .attr() instead?
[10:07:14] <shoky> if (i === 'client') { continue; }
[10:08:08] <shoky> don't think .attr() will help
[10:11:11] <george_> like this? http://codepen.io/piers/pen/cFyDB - doesnt seem to work :(
[10:11:25] <shoky> huh
[10:11:32] <shoky> you didn't put the continue
[10:13:42] <george_> oh wow perfect, thank you very much
[10:14:44] <RRR2> lol
[10:14:46] <george_> i dont plan on adding any more attributres so do you think using .data() will be ok - it seems to be working here
[10:15:33] <shoky> george_: it'll work ok as long as nothing adds any jquery data to your elements. many plugins do that, for example..
[10:18:04] <george_> thanks shoky
[10:35:12] <kelsadita> can anyone tell me even if I have appended seperator div to class 1 and class 2....why is it not visible ?
[10:35:30] <kelsadita> here is the fiddle
[10:35:32] <kelsadita> http://jsfiddle.net/H88NB/
[10:36:27] <Anniepoo> how do you spell separator?
[10:36:42] <Anniepoo> nvm - it's variable name
[10:37:35] <kelsadita> yeah
[10:40:43] <kelsadita> even it is appended to class1 ...I cant see it in output...why is it so ?
[10:40:51] <shoky> it's there..
[10:41:24] <shoky> oh
[10:41:36] <kelsadita> did u check ?
[10:41:37] <shoky> kelsadita: when you append it to class2, it's removed from class1
[10:41:44] <kelsadita> hmm
[10:41:46] <shoky> you might want to .clone() it
[10:42:16] <kelsadita> okz...is there any reason behind it
[10:42:29] <shoky> yes. if you don't clone it, there is only one
[10:42:37] <shoky> the last place you put it in is where it will be
[10:43:10] <kelsadita> ohk...thanx a lot @shoky :)

[11:07:55] <kozmikreis> I have a question: I want to add an attribute to an element, BUT, I want the quotes around the attribute value to be single quotes, not double.  How?!
[11:08:32] <kozmikreis> (The reason being the content is a string of JSON that happens to have some unescaped quotes already in it)
[11:21:09] <jnhghy> I'm trying to implement a jquery sketch tool, but I need to include it in a file from a differant folder, when I do that, all my hrefs break, how should I do it?
[11:24:34] <grafi> can you elaborate a little more jnhghy?
[11:29:32] <jnhghy> grafi: pls check: http://pastebin.com/WXNDcLfh
[11:31:44] <grafi> you probably need to change the urls then
[11:32:12] <jnhghy> grafin: in all js files?
[11:32:36] <grafi> why do you have urls in your js files?
[11:32:54] <jnhghy> beacause some js files include other js files
[11:33:28] <amh345> does query have an unless function?  i want to execute a block of code only if a data attribute is present.
[11:34:09] <grafi> so use an if amh345
[11:34:19] <amh345> yeah. looks like.
[11:34:19] <grafi> sounds fun jnhghy
[11:34:51] <jnhghy> grafi: got it... thanks for the info ...
[11:57:55] <rudiX> is there alternative for  'apply'
[11:58:05] <rudiX> because I am getting this "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined "
[11:59:15] <shoky> rudiX: you're calling it on undefined, it seems..
[11:59:34] <rudiX> darn
[11:59:48] <grafi> ^^
[12:00:12] <rudiX> is there any plugin that supports delay on mousemove
[12:00:54] <rudiX> like to be able to trigger $('#element').hide() only once per 3 seconds
[12:02:30] <shoky> don't ask 5 questions in one and maybe someone can help you
[12:03:49] <rudiX> thanks ... the thingy i was searching is "throtling" ... whatever this complicated english word means
[12:03:51] <rudiX> doh
[12:04:19] <rudiX> "debounce" too :/
[12:08:45] <grafi> debounce oÃ´
[12:12:58] <rudiX> yeah
[12:12:59] <rudiX> http://remysharp.com/2010/07/21/throttling-function-calls/
[12:13:13] <rudiX> long live to remy
[12:14:18] <grafi> so i take it you have found the answer to your question
[12:30:17] <grafi> prost
[12:41:59] <philosophically> using jquery mobile on my local environment. on safari with the user agent changed to iPhone 3.0 the persistent navbar is working but when i test on iPad and iPhone it is not working, however when i go to the query mobile demos page it is working on the devices. i am loading query mobile 1.3.1 and query 1.9.1 on cdn, using the same meta data for viewport, the same classes and properties for my divs as the demo and
[12:42:00] <philosophically> it is still not working, what could i be doing wrong?
[12:57:44] <jnhghy> I need to load files from 2 different folders, is there a way to change the <base href> tag using jquery? and to load all the hrefs with it?
[13:30:10] <verism> hi, again - this time i have a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/verism/5UvnK/
[13:30:48] <verism> can anyone tell me why the latter isotope method doesn't correctly format the results?
[13:43:43] <aperb> Hello, is there aynone who know how i can scroll to a element on a page with jquery mobile? I tried: $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#36').offset().top - 30});  but it does not work on Android  for some reason :/
[14:01:55] <adavia> Guys if i use dataType:"json" in an ajax call is not necessary to do JSON.parse();
[14:03:41] <Eviltwin> It's not necessary to do it for the success method, no
[14:04:48] <verism> me?
[14:05:50] <Tomashe> hey guys i have a simple form : <form action="" method="post"><button type="submit" name="compareb"></button></form>	, using live jquery i insert inputs there but when i POST it i recive just the "compareb" post that sent
[14:05:50] <Eviltwin> verism: No, I don't use that plugin so I don't know how it works
[14:05:52] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[14:06:34] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Tomashe
[14:06:34] <b-ot> Tomashe: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:06:35] <bot-t> Tomashe, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:06:41] <Eviltwin> Please make a demo at jsFiddle.net
[14:06:45] <Tomashe> ok
[14:09:42] <Tomashe> i got it fixed :)
[14:09:47] <Tomashe> thanks guys fiddle helps alot
[14:11:28] <dysf> Does anyone know if there is a way to trigger an asynchronous postback (rather than full postback) from a Jquery Colorbox?
[14:14:53] <verism> wish a fiddle was all it took...
[14:19:23] <sacuey> hay guys ive created a validation function that works perfectly fine but ive been repeating a lot of code through the selectors is there anyway i can minimize this code? http://pastie.org/8119069
[14:29:14] <shoky> verism:  your "first" isn't a boolean.  make it true/false  not 'true'/'false'
[14:30:38] <verism> shoky: appreciated, but that doesn't make any difference
[14:31:07] <verism> i think it's something wrong with the arguments i'm passing into the isotope call
[14:31:19] <Eviltwin> Well what you are doing is wrong
[14:31:28] <Eviltwin> It's calling the "first" version every time
[14:31:47] <verism> but i've followed every example out there and can't find an alternative
[14:31:56] <shoky> also your $items never changes
[14:32:14] <verism> Eviltwin: not so, i logged out the result and the else fires
[14:33:30] <tds5016> hey. can someone suggest what the best internationalization library would be for use with jquery/require/backbone?
[14:33:30] <Eviltwin> verism: http://jsfiddle.net/5UvnK/4/
[14:33:33] <Eviltwin> Doesn't look like it to me
[14:35:15] <verism> odd - well, this example definitely fires the second but with the same issue http://jsfiddle.net/verism/5UvnK/5/
[14:35:36] <verism> shoky: you mean it never gets reset?
[14:35:59] <shoky> verism: it never gets changed, at all
[14:36:08] <verism> ah
[14:36:26] <verism> hmmm
[14:46:40] <shoky> verism: http://jsfiddle.net/5UvnK/6/
[14:47:23] <verism> oh jesus god - thank you
[14:48:06] <Eviltwin> This should also work: http://jsfiddle.net/5UvnK/7/
[14:48:08] <verism> i'd stupidly mangled together two similar attempts in my example
[14:49:18] <verism> thanks to you both - you've made me a very happy person
[15:26:40] <Tomashe> hey guys anyone knows any good plugin like wookmark , i can not use wookmark soo many positions issues accure
[15:26:51] <Tomashe> so i was thinking maybe someone got some suggestion?
[15:33:57] <Corrado> how can i call a function in another html if i use changePage in jquery mobile? i try with pageinit but dosen't works
[15:40:58] <adavia> whats the correct way to concatenate this .text("<p>"val.edificacion + " " + val.localidad"</p>"); ?
[15:43:33] <monk3y> adavia: "<p>" + val.edificacion + " " + val.localidad + "</p>"
[15:43:36] <monk3y> Is that what you meant?
[15:44:10] <adavia> monk3y:  ohh yess
[15:44:11] <adavia> thanks
[15:47:50] <OnceMe> Hello
[15:48:14] <OnceMe> I do jQuery (ajax) validation
[15:48:28] <OnceMe> but I have problem upon a successful signup at the form
[15:49:05] <OnceMe> I made it like Facebook do it for sign up page, on submit click, I call external script, check data and retrieve info, the problem is when its successful redirect is placed inside the div
[15:55:34] <monk3y> OnceMe: I'm not sure what the problem is there - did you mis-type or omit something?  As in is it meant to be inside the div or not?  Could you create a jsFiddle for it?
[15:55:48] <OnceMe> Hardly
[15:55:52] <OnceMe> there is a lot of checking
[15:56:54] <OnceMe> but the idea is, I have <div id="statusinfo"></div>
[15:58:00] <OnceMe> monk3y:here is code http://jsfiddle.net/hsTCs/
[15:58:35] <OnceMe> basically, my code put the user at customurl if response is good, from external script
[15:58:53] <OnceMe> however when I do header(); to move user to the new url, its loaded inside that suc div
[15:59:06] <OnceMe> Thats the major issue, so I don't have proper fallback when js is disabled
[16:02:57] <shoky> OnceMe: then don't do a redirect if it's an ajax request
[16:03:06] <OnceMe> what to do?
[16:03:09] <OnceMe> When it comes to fallback
[16:03:27] <shoky> fallback means it's NOT an ajax request
[16:03:53] <shoky> unless i misundertood you
[16:03:55] <OnceMe> so to pull up from other url then action="" ?
[16:04:17] <OnceMe> oh thanks
[16:04:19] <OnceMe> Ill try something
[16:04:29] <shoky> add some POST param for example, if it's coming from the ajax
[16:04:37] <shoky> and check that in your server code
[16:04:45] <OnceMe> yeah thanks
[16:04:45] <OnceMe> :)
[16:14:14] <OnceMe> shoky:I made fallback
[16:14:26] <OnceMe> but I still cant manage to make whole ajax submission form
[16:14:38] <OnceMe> I mean, that part with redirect via ajax
[16:15:00] <OnceMe> When I hit submit button, it goes to ajaxscript check if all is valid and if it is injects data info in db, and then what?
[16:23:04] <OnceMe> nvm all good now..
[16:39:34] <sammichToo> okay, JS question here: I think you can edit inline JS inside script tags but you can't edit an external JS file, right?
[16:43:52] <adavia> any idea why this does not work http://jsfiddle.net/GkNRb/6/ ?
[16:44:43] <tw2113> n.toFixed is not a function error
[16:45:17] <adavia> oww
[16:45:30] <adavia> its a string
[17:05:38] <adavia> actually this was what i meant http://jsfiddle.net/N46mD/1/
[17:08:13] <shoky> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/N46mD/2/
[17:08:52] <adavia> shoky:  whats does number do?
[17:09:24] <shoky> turns it into a number
[17:09:32] <shoky> "1234.55" is not a number
[17:10:10] <shoky> also removed the parseFloat - donno why you had it there
[17:11:34] <adavia> shoky:  thanks !
[17:16:53] <boytoy> Almost there! I'm trying to enable iScroll on YouTube videos in cases where the gesture begins on the videos themselves: https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/41
[17:16:56] <boytoy> So I added invisible layers on top of each video -- which will then pass on any clicks to the videos below: http://jsbin.com/avujix/15/ -- but so far the clicks don't seem to get passed down. alert("clicked"); shows that the clicks do take place though. Anyone?
[17:19:19] <shoky> boytoy: no idea what you're doing, but putting $('.click_layer').click(..   inside a loop doesn't make sense
[17:21:26] <boytoy> shoky: It's for mobile scrolling basically. It works fine until the user tries to initiate the scroll on top of the YouTube videos.
[17:21:37] <shoky> boytoy: whatever it's for, it doesn't make sense and is most likely wrong.
[17:21:47] <boytoy> shoky: Good point
[17:21:50] <shoky> $('.click_layer').click(...  adds click handlers for all .click_layer elements
[17:22:14] <shoky> done in a loop, it add multiple click handlers for each .click_layer element
[17:22:44] <boytoy> shoky: $(this, '.click_layer').click perhaps then?
[17:22:56] <shoky> boytoy: that would work but there's no need for the loop,
[17:23:20] <shoky> boytoy:  $('.iframe_wrapper > .click_layer').click(function.... )
[17:23:38] <boytoy> hmm
[17:23:41] <boytoy> thats hot..
[17:23:47] <shoky> var iframe = $('iframe').get(0);   only gets the first iframe in the page
[17:24:17] <boytoy> ah that would explain it! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15248970/iframe-prevents-iscroll-scrolling-on-mobile-safari where i got it from is only meant for a single iframe!
[17:24:36] <shoky> don't use code you don't understand
[17:25:17] <boytoy> yeah..
[17:25:26] <shoky> er on the SO page it's with an ID
[17:25:34] <shoky> so nevermind that ;p
[17:25:45] * Slick` I have very fresh credit cards for sell, from my own sniffers and logs ;) many different bins and countries :) 10$ each, write me any interested in linotrecias@gmail.com
[17:26:01] <boytoy> haha
[17:26:17] <boytoy> rascal Slick`
[17:28:00] <boytoy> shoky: var iframe = $('iframe'); right? http://jsbin.com/avujix/15/ still no dice
[17:28:05] <shoky> no
[17:28:11] <shoky> $('iframe')  selects all iframes
[17:28:36] <boytoy> ah, $(this, 'iframe')? :)
[17:28:46] <shoky> what's  this?
[17:29:08] <boytoy> is that not .iframe_wrapper .click_layer?
[17:29:14] <shoky> also your later code doesn't want a jquery object
[17:29:22] <shoky> yes. so the iframe is not a descendant of it
[17:29:28] <shoky> so not $(this, 'iframe')
[17:30:45] <boytoy> shoky: doesnt wanta  jquery object, how so?
[17:31:02] <shoky> iframe.contentDocument  for example
[17:31:17] <shoky> counts on iframe being a pure element object, not wrapped in a jquery object
[17:31:26] <shoky> that's what the .get(0)  was for
[17:31:50] <shoky> meh. var iframe = $(this).siblings('iframe')[0];
[17:32:01] <boytoy> hehe meh? :)
[17:32:44] <shoky> got tired of waiting ;p
[17:32:59] <shoky> [0] is same as .get(0)  btw
[17:33:03] <boytoy> lol
[17:33:04] <boytoy> ah ok
[17:34:01] <boytoy> shoky: i gotta do something with var iframeDoc too or?
[17:34:34] <shoky> don't think so
[17:35:15] <boytoy> no dice clicking on bob moob
[17:35:25] <boytoy> very nice documentary btw i recommend watching it
[17:35:38] <boytoy> im sure programmers will find it extra interesting
[17:35:52] <boytoy> * bob moog
[17:36:28] <shoky> boytoy: it's not working because the iframe src is from a different domain
[17:36:40] <shoky> so you can't access its inner document
[17:36:54] <shoky> Blocked a frame with origin "http://jsbin.com" from accessing a frame with origin "http://www.youtube.com". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
[17:37:12] <boytoy> oh lord please no
[17:37:31] <boytoy> so its a dead end altogether?
[17:38:24] <shoky> trying to trigger a click on an element inside the youtube iframe.. yeah i think so
[17:39:53] <boytoy> shoky: but i can click it manually just fine assuming .click_layer ain't there, so why shouldn't jquery be able to do the same..
[17:40:17] <boytoy> say it aint so say it aint so
[17:41:31] <shoky> cause jquery is running from a different domain
[17:41:54] <shoky> when you click it yourself you're interacting with the iframe's document yourself
[17:42:35] <shoky> that's prolly a bad explanation ;s
[17:43:13] <boytoy> hmm.. so running jquery from say jsbin.com wouldnt make a difference?
[17:43:38] <boytoy> because i am hosting jquery myself on my site so
[17:44:14] <shoky> nono
[17:44:32] <shoky> i mean the page jquery is running on is on a different origin.  jsbin vs. youtube
[17:44:45] <shoky> doesnt matter where the jquery script was loaded from
[17:44:52] <boytoy> i see i see..
[17:45:24] <boytoy> damn, so you can't picture any sort of hack for this? users will forever and ever be unable to watch youtube from my mobile site?
[17:46:04] <shoky> i see that github issues page has suggestions to do some stuff only while scrolling
[17:46:28] <shoky> maybe you could add those click_divs only while scrolling (and remove them when not scrolling)
[17:46:59] <boytoy> hmm
[17:47:15] <shoky> or add pointer-events: none   only while scrolling
[17:47:17] <boytoy> but will that help when the scroll gesture is being initiated on the youtube videos themselves?
[17:47:19] <shoky> sounds simpler
[17:47:39] <shoky> oh. no idea
[17:48:11] <shoky> i've never held an iphone/ipad for more than 5 min
[17:48:18] <boytoy> hehe
[17:50:38] <boytoy> yeah me neither
[17:50:43] <boytoy> im still rocking a gsm phone so
[17:51:41] <shoky> me too
[17:51:46] <shoky> hate gadgets
[17:51:54] <boytoy> :)
[17:59:10] <igcewieling1> Can anyone point me on documention on accessing the $ in the parent document from inside a child iframe?
[18:05:21] <shoky> igcewieling1: window.parent.$
[18:11:41] <boytoy> shoky: Maybe I could make a script to take screenshots of the videos and show those screenshots instead? Then only when the user clicks on these screenshots do I load the actual videos
[18:13:07] <shoky> boytoy: and you'd have the same problem after they've clicked it once, no?
[18:14:04] <boytoy> shoky: i guess i could make the video full screen and only allow scrolling to resume once they've exited full screen at which point the screenshot would return
[18:15:14] <shoky> adunno
[18:15:23] <shoky> can't you avoid the need for this iscroll plugin?
[18:15:47] <boytoy> sadly no, theres no other way to enable scrolling on mobile :/
[18:16:14] <shoky> not all sites you can scroll use a plugin for it.. do they?
[18:16:36] <boytoy> i think they do
[18:17:02] <boytoy> except for mobile apps this behavior comes built-in.. but for mobile websites we need this iscroll thing to emulate the way it works with apps
[18:17:28] <boytoy> dunno im still trying to wrap my head around it
[18:17:44] <shoky> it's only for scrolling specific elemenets or something, no?
[18:18:04] <shoky> i'm sure you can scroll the main browser window/body without a plugin..
[18:19:23] <boytoy> shoky: yeah specific elements i think..
[18:20:01] <boytoy> could be scrolling in general too as its behavior is a little bit different from regular desktop scrolling
[18:20:18] <boytoy> curious why this isnt built into mobile browsers by default though
[18:20:43] <shoky> from what i'm reading, it is in the newer ones
[18:21:20] <shoky> iOS 5
[18:21:39] <boytoy> ah thats great
[18:21:44] <boytoy> something to look forward to then :p
[18:35:19] <igcewieling1> shoky: thanks!
[18:46:16] <Whirl3d> wait. iOS7 is about to drop and we are looking forward to iOS5? Did I miss something?
[19:00:06] <shoky> Whirl3d has a point, boytoy
[19:02:56] <crazyzurfer> hi guys, i have an issue, i've got a dinamic code, and there I inserted some jquery process, the problem is that I must include jquery at the bottom of the page and, i doesn't work because i'm trying to define things that have not yet been defined, so this gives "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined". is there a way to make the code wait untill jquery is loaded?
[19:03:48] <shoky> load jquery at the top? put your script in the bottom?
[19:04:25] <crazyzurfer> yes, that's a way, but i've got tons of pages like mentioned before and changing it all is going to be really boring
[19:04:51] <shoky> lol
[19:05:15] <crazyzurfer> and I loaded jquery at the bottom to have a faster loading of the page
[19:06:00] <boytoy> lulz
[19:06:17] <crazyzurfer> is that stupid what i'm asking? :/
[19:06:27] <boytoy> Whirl3d: yeah you missed that both shoky and I are still on GSM :p
[19:08:13] <shoky> boytoy: over 98% of iOS users have iOS 5 or newer
[19:08:34] <boytoy> yeah that makes sense
[19:08:42] <boytoy> older mobiles are cheaper and easier to get
[19:08:56] <shoky> wat
[19:09:07] <Whirl3d> In US, IOS5 devices are free, really Subsidized by Apple
[19:09:12] <boytoy> same for android, 40% use v2 while v4 is the latest
[19:09:15] <shoky> wat
[19:09:22] <shoky> how do you mean, Whirl3d?
[19:09:37] <shoky> boytoy: i think you misread me ;p
[19:09:57] <boytoy> ah yeah missed the "or newer" part hehe
[19:10:29] <shoky> my point was that less than 2% of iOS users have iOS older than 5
[19:10:44] <Whirl3d> http://www.techhive.com/article/241172/atandts_free_iphone_will_cost_at_least_1_355_76.html
[19:10:45] <boytoy> yep.. but still.. especially in the 3rd world where mobile growth is exploding.. its mostly old devices
[19:11:05] <boytoy> i guess mobile growth is exploding everywhere though
[19:11:52] <Whirl3d> but that was 2 years ago...
[19:11:58] <shoky> 2 year contract doesn't sound free :S
[19:12:06] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:12:12] <Whirl3d> Good point.
[19:16:36] <boytoy> :D
[19:24:11] <prbc> cd github
[19:29:45] <Someguy123> so I'm loading a page through .load, but I need to have a $('.myClass').click handler for the page that loads. what's the best way to do this?
[19:30:10] <Someguy123> I've spent the past hour confused to why my .click wasn't working, then I realized that it's because I'm loading a page with .load
[19:33:49] <Moleboy> I was wondering if it was possible to use jquery to add elements to a DIFFERENT page
[19:34:30] <Moleboy> Anyone know if you can use jQuery to affect a page other than the one you are currently accessing?
[19:34:56] <Someguy123> Moleboy, that would be a security danger
[19:35:03] <Moleboy> darn
[19:35:15] <Someguy123> you'd have to .load the other page in
[19:35:19] <Someguy123> THEN add the elements
[19:36:18] <Moleboy> I'm trying to make a page easily editable, but only by a couple of specific people. It's not a website that has any log ins though. any thoughts on how I might go about it? I know how to add elements, but I"m trying to limit it to a couple of people
[19:37:15] <Moleboy> Someguy123: any ideas?
[19:37:17] <tw2113> the thing is that the page hasn't even begun to render
[19:37:24] <tw2113> so there's nothing to inject into anyway
[19:37:31] <Moleboy> hmm
[19:37:36] <tw2113> and jQuery won't write to html files that i know of
[19:37:49] <Moleboy> crap, so it's not permanent
[19:38:12] <Moleboy> Welp
[19:38:21] <Moleboy> Might anyone be able to point me in the direction I should look?
[19:59:50] <Puck6633> Can anyone explain to me why I can't catch exceptions from an AJAX callback? See here: http://jsfiddle.net/Fw5H2/1/
[20:01:32] <Puck6633> Exceptions are raised from within the callback, but they seem to bypass all of my try-catch blocks and go straight to the error console.
[20:04:37] <bambanx> yooooo
[20:05:42] <boytoy> yo yo
[20:17:39] <shoky> Puck6633: by the time the ajax callback is executed, f()'s execution has long ended and the try-catch block has long been forgotten
[20:35:31] <marcc> hi dumbos
[20:36:24] <marcc> why does  $('form').on('ajax:success') not work for newly added elements?
[20:37:06] <marcc> it seems like  ajax:success does not bind itself with new elements added to the DOM. is my assumption correct?
[20:37:47] <Ansikt> marcc: look up event delegation...basically, what you need is to put the $(selector) on an element that is so high up the DOM tree that it is always there, then
[20:38:00] <shoky> why bind ajax events to elements, anyway
[20:38:18] <Ansikt> do .on('ajax:success', 'form', callback)
[20:39:56] <marcc> so like $(document).on('ajax:success', 'form', callback)?
[20:42:52] <shoky> i doubt that'd work
[20:43:20] <marcc> it works bitch
[20:43:26] <marcc> :-P
[20:45:30] <shoky> gross ;p
[20:47:55] <shoky> where does that syntax come from anyways. not working for me
[20:48:19] <kanja> I can't find this in the docs - how do I do a query within a jquery object? I thought it was $('.foo').$('.bar') but that isn't working
[20:48:38] <shoky> how do you do what?
[20:49:12] <kanja> if I have div as an object and I want to search only within that div
[20:49:24] <shoky> ?find
[20:49:26] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[20:49:34] <kanja> find
[20:49:35] <kanja> awesome
[20:49:40] <kanja> too much ember :)
[20:49:54] <kanja> what's a better name for that? a scoped query?
[20:51:43] <shoky> sorry what you said was fine. i just read it first as "how do I do a jquery within a jquery" :p
[20:57:25] <innociv> yo dawg i herd you like jquery
[20:58:22] <shoky> $.$
[21:05:25] <Puck6633> shoky: Brilliant, thank you! Asynchronous behavior messes with my head. :P
[21:06:40] <boytoy> Is there a nice way to do click() twice?
[21:07:19] <boytoy> other than $('.button').click(); $('.button').click();
[21:08:16] <boytoy> ooh, $('.button').click().click(); ..
[21:08:53] <shoky> why?
[21:09:38] <boytoy> long story :p
[21:10:02] <boytoy> silly really
[21:10:07] <shoky> most likely
[21:10:29] <shoky> even the first .click() is probably silly ;p
[21:12:13] <boytoy> lol
[21:12:21] <boytoy> mmmm hmmm :p
[21:27:40] <Guest97617> hi
[21:55:25] <Whirl3d> is there any way to do shape-masking without canvas? I need to make a pie shaped button, that when dragged over, expands radially
[21:58:44] <Whirl3d> radial popup menus are soon to be all the rage...
[22:53:00] <Firetaffer> What's a way to make the text() of a <p> tag toggle between "Hello" and "Goodbye" upon each click?
[23:22:39] <[E]sc> i'm trying to write a script that will log a person out of my website automatically if they haven't touched anything for a period of time, and it will reset the timer if any action has taken place, keeping the php server alive...however, it's not working how i want it to; the clearTimeout is not clearing, does anyone have any idea where I might have gone wrong? here's the code: http://pastebin.ca/2420533
[23:24:12] <Cork> [E]sc: you can't return values from an ajax callback
[23:25:06] <Cork> [E]sc: so you're breaking the code on line 61
[23:26:58] <[E]sc> thanks Cork!  then how can i re-initialize those variables?
[23:27:46] <Cork> [E]sc: simplest is to just do it on line 5 and 44
[23:28:09] <Cork> remove var on line 44 and line 60 and 61 and you should have them globally set
[23:28:53] <Cork> (if you want to make it a bit more obvious you can replace var pageRequestTime with window.pageRequestTime
[23:28:55] <Cork> )
[23:29:17] <[E]sc> ok, thanks Cork, i'll give that a try
[23:40:12] <[E]sc> if i do a clearTimeout(timeoutHandle); should the timer be reset to zero? because in my script it's not getting cleared and keeps incrementing from when the page requests started...
[23:41:58] <Cork> [E]sc: the variable isn't touched
[23:42:06] <Cork> it just uses the passed value for lookup
[23:47:12] <[E]sc> Cork, so the script technically should work; the timer is getting reset each time the function is called? Because i'm worried my script's logic or whatever is flawed...
[23:48:25] <Cork> [E]sc: as long as the function is actually called, and the right order, it should work fine
[23:49:44] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks a lot...hopefully i have the right order.
[23:50:11] <Cork> [E]sc: just remember that ajax is async, so you have to take care to not get racy
[23:51:17] <[E]sc> I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Cork.
