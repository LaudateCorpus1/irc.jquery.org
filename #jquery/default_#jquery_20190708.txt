[06:13:45] <cod> Hey guys! Do you have an idea why `jQuery($0).on('click', ()=>console.log('X'))` does not work but `$0.addEventListener('click', (e) => console.log(e))` does?
[07:10:30] <Cork> cod: most likely cause jquery uses document as base
[07:10:53] <Cork> cod: but ya, not really the correct channel for the question
[07:11:11] <Cork> (better asked in a channel for the environment you're running it in)
[07:11:51] <cod> Cork by "environment" you mean the application or if it's browser/node?
[07:13:59] <cod> and could you tell me more about the "document as base" thing?
[07:28:34] <Cork> cod: environent is where the code runs
[07:29:05] <Cork> so either or both, depending on context (and why it isn't really on topic here)
[10:53:59] <znf> Does anyone have experience with Parsley? I'm trying to create some custom validators, and I tought this worked, until someone reported an issue with one of my validators. I checked it myself and I was finally able to reproduce it. Turns out, when my function runs, it prevents the form from being submitted, and form.parsley().validate() returns null, instead of true/false
[10:55:14] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1. without seeing it, it's very hard to help. 2: that seems better suited for ##javascript. :)
[10:57:59] <znf> you're probably right, I just always saw Parsley as a jquery lib/plugin, even tough it isn't :P
[10:58:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:58:13] <robertmaxrees> also: https://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html#events-list
[11:02:26] <znf> robertmaxrees, I'm assuming it's because of the way I answer back from server-side, so, while I got your attention, this is the relevant code: https://0bin.net/paste/jAgboC0X+NspRfdu#X0VkwBndlbPDPRAhAChVRzKfy867tolKFKprJ9O7Qs1 - the 'iban' validator is my current issue
[11:02:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, go ahead and move over to ##javascripts - see if they can't help you there :)
[11:02:51] <znf> thanks :)
[11:02:59] <znf> with an S at the end?
[11:03:10] <robertmaxrees> without.
[11:03:18] <robertmaxrees> you're already in ##javascript it looks like.
[11:03:28] <robertmaxrees> so just ask there :)
[11:54:07] <sine0> I have tried every stack exchange post about emulating a mouse hover over a link to make it light up using js
[11:54:39] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[11:55:02] <sine0> I want the menu hovers to cycle through on page load
[11:55:07] <makr8100> agreed, why?  also have you tried .focus() ??
[11:55:09] <sine0> a little visual display
[11:55:25] <makr8100> idk if <a> supports .focus() but it just came to mind
[11:55:30] <robertmaxrees> there's no real guarantee that'll be doable via js.
[11:55:43] <robertmaxrees> are you controlling the menu hide/show via js?
[11:55:45] <sine0> they dont werk either
[11:56:01] <sine0> yea
[11:56:05] <makr8100> also that would be weird behavior because it would actually move focus if it worked
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> then expose a little api and call that instead.
[11:56:21] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to wrangle the DOM
[11:56:40] <sine0> I think it would be easier to just add and remove class that does the same effect...
[11:56:46] <makr8100> .trigger('hover')
[11:56:49] <makr8100> ^ that's legit
[11:57:01] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 .trigger() likely won't work in cases like this.
[11:57:04] <makr8100> kidding I have no clue, it's also not very smart if it even does anything
[11:57:18] <sine0> no it doesnt work
[11:57:19] <robertmaxrees> sine0 you're proxying logic through the DOM.
[11:57:26] <sine0> the top level has a class so im targetting that
[11:57:27] <robertmaxrees> "easier" in this case is going to be inherently worse.
[11:57:46] <sine0> ok robertmaxrees what do you mean expose a little api
[11:58:04] <makr8100> I would add a class called .hover to css to apply the same rules as :hover, then toggleClass or addClass/removeClass
[11:58:06] <robertmaxrees> create functions that you can call that let you fire your logic.
[11:58:09] <makr8100> that really should work
[11:58:34] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 that only works if all that changes is based around a single css class :)
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> other logic might be firing that's outside the CSS domain.
[12:00:16] <sine0> robertmaxrees: creating functions I can call is great... but I want to work out what will work in those functions to change the css which normally happens when the mouse hovers, I have added style. my next thought is like I said to get the list of li a and then addclass remove class with the class having the transition: all 1s; etc
[12:00:39] <robertmaxrees> sine0 without seeing any code, it's really hard to help.
[12:00:43] <robertmaxrees> since i don't have any context.
[12:00:58] <sine0> I just want to emulate a mouse hover without the mouse hover to trigger the :hover css
[12:01:11] <makr8100> a:hover, a.hover { /*CSS rules*/ } ... $(document).on('ready', function() { /*build each() logic on <a> tags*/ }) ... $(this).addClass('hover'); /*pause*/ $(this).removeClass('hover')
[12:01:15] <sine0> failing that I want to know the correct way to do it, if addclass and removeclass is not it
[12:01:23] <makr8100> the loop with delay is the hardest part
[12:01:44] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 thanks, but it's better if we help them step through a solution themselves :)
[12:01:59] <robertmaxrees> sine0 if adding and removing calsses is all you need to do, then just do that.
[12:02:03] <sine0> ok
[12:02:19] <robertmaxrees> proxying logic through the DOM is something you should avoid as much as possible.
[12:02:29] <robertmaxrees> don't trigger events when really you want to fix some logic.
[12:02:47] <makr8100> meh, I didn't even provide 1/2 the logic lol
[12:03:02] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[12:04:12] <makr8100> there are some cool css ways to do stuff here: https://github.com/wesbos/aprilFools.css/blob/master/aprilFools.css
[12:04:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:04:37] <makr8100> skip to line 152 for my favorite
[12:05:06] <makr8100> and then: p:before { content: "YOLO "; }
[17:47:31] <justoinkit> Hi all
[17:47:52] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[17:48:00] <justoinkit> What's the best way to create an element using jquery?
[17:48:08] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[17:48:16] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways so it kind of depends on your case :)
[17:48:25] <justoinkit> ugh i'm at work so i can't really post any code...
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to append something
[17:48:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:49:08] <justoinkit> no im trying to create a div with 2 textareas and a textfield
[17:49:22] <robertmaxrees> and then doing what with it?
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> lots of jquery methods can take html, so sometimes your best bet is to just inline it, depending.
[17:51:25] <justoinkit> I'm combining it with django to create a UML maker with a skeleton code generator
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not really answering my question :/
[17:51:56] <robertmaxrees> like, you'll create this element - then what?
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> what happens with it next?
[17:52:02] <justoinkit> Add it to a div
[17:52:21] <robertmaxrees> lol so then yeah, you'll be appending it :)
[17:52:23] <justoinkit> I have it set up currently using DOM but JQuery is nicer
[17:53:02] <robertmaxrees> you can do $('<div>'); <- this will create a full <div></div>
[17:53:23] <robertmaxrees> const $myNewDiv = $('<div>'), $foo = $('<textarea id="foo
[17:53:33] <robertmaxrees> err
[17:53:42] <robertmaxrees> const $myNewDiv = $('<div>'), $foo = $('<textarea id="foo">');  $myNewDiv.append($foo);
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[17:54:51] <justoinkit> oh do i have to use $myNewDiv? i can't use mynewdiv?
[17:55:09] <robertmaxrees> the dollar sign is just a convention, but a good one to follow :)
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> but follow whatever convention your codebase already has.
[17:56:33] <justoinkit> well it's a pretty new codebase, and i like the dollar signs
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> :) then there you go.
[17:56:44] <justoinkit> if it doesn't mess up JS syntax i'll do it :D
[18:04:50] <makr8100> justoinkit: I always liked this format for js readability
[18:04:53] <makr8100> $('#myElement').append($('<div>', {class: 'divClass'}).append('<input>', {name: 'textInput', id: 'textInput', type: 'text'}).append('<input>', {name: 'numberInput', id: 'numberInput', type: 'number'}));
[18:05:18] <makr8100> space that out on line breaks
[18:05:25] <makr8100> urrr...  hold on a sec
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> i would argue against doing that.
[18:06:16] <makr8100> $('#myElement').append($('<div>', {class: 'divClass'}).append($('<input>', {name: 'textInput', id: 'textInput', type: 'text'})).append($('<input>', {name: 'numberInput', id: 'numberInput', type: 'number'})));
[18:06:22] <makr8100> first was incorrect
[18:06:51] <makr8100> and someone would argue against literally everything :P
[18:07:06] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: it's an added layer of complexity for 0 benefit.
[18:07:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue that it's less readable.
[18:07:40] <makr8100> I think it's more readable, of course like I said you need line breaks in there
[18:07:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:07:46] <makr8100> anyways I'm off, later all
[18:07:54] <justoinkit> thanks for your help
[18:08:00] <justoinkit> +karma
[18:09:02] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason templating engines - especially ones with large adoption and longevity - tend to avoid that kind of syntax, but what would I know.
[18:51:07] <tona> hello evryone
[18:51:56] <tona> how can I select one particular option from my Select tag using Jquery , I have tried many but seem noone works
[18:52:19] <tona> jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").attr("selected",true);
[18:52:42] <tona> my select is named distro and my option in  particular I want to chose is Ubuntu
[18:52:51] <tona> I am wondering if someone could guide me
[19:00:01] <shoky> tona: $("select[name='distro']").val('Ubuntu')  should work. unless this is a multi-select, in which case use .prop instead of .attr
[19:00:19] <tona> yes it is multi-select
[19:02:12] <tona> but if it is multi.select I am not able to see prop in your command
[19:02:16] <tona> shoky
[19:02:43] <shoky> tona: i mean in your command, not mine
[19:03:00] <tona> ok :)
[19:03:21] <shoky> tona: jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").prop("selected",true);
[19:04:00] <shoky> make sure it's selecting something with:  console.log( jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").length )
[19:06:02] <tona> appear undefined,
[19:06:31] <tona> <select id="distro" multiple=""
[19:06:39] <shoky> jquery not loaded ok maybe?
[19:06:47] <shoky> no errors?
[19:06:55] <tona> no on the console
[19:07:59] <shoky> what is  console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery) ?
[19:08:40] <tona> jquery 2.2.4
[19:09:01] <shoky> i gotta go.  anyway make sure you can select properly with  jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']")
[19:09:09] <shoky> sry bye
[19:15:36] <tona> hi everyone, I have one select id="distro" multiselect , I want to set one element automatically using jquery , i tried to use  jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").attr("selected",true);  and jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").prop("selected",true);
[19:15:50] <tona> bu these option not work from my side
[19:16:20] <tona> I am wondering if someone could help me
[19:25:13] <tona> hi everyone, I have one select id="distro" multiselect , I want to set one element automatically using jquery , i tried to use  jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").attr("selected",true);  and jQuery("select[name='distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").prop("selected",true);
[19:26:58] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[19:29:28] <robertmaxrees> tona also: name and ID are not the same thing.
[19:29:52] <tona> I tried to use id too
[19:30:02] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're tried.
[19:30:05] <tona> I am trying to create the file in fsdidile
[19:30:08] <tona> ok
[19:31:04] <tona> jQuery("select[id='select_distro']").find("option[value='Ubuntu']").prop("selected",true); , I changed by id and nothing too :(
[19:31:19] <robertmaxrees> i need to see your markup and js in one place.
[19:33:05] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/t6gL5scz/
[19:33:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1uharn9z/
[19:33:36] <robertmaxrees> works if you include jquery...
[19:33:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:34:57] <robertmaxrees> also: you can just do jQuery("#select_distro").val('c');
[19:36:38] <Robdgreat> magic
[19:36:48] <tona> ok,
[19:36:52] <tona> thanks so much
[19:38:15] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:49:37] <tona> Hi robermaxrees again
[19:49:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:50:40] <tona> I would like to use the same solution in this implementation related with select multiples, but I tried to apply the solution here and it doesnt work , only work when they are default
[19:50:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:50:59] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/sgeto2dr/
[19:51:11] <robertmaxrees> still not following
[19:51:29] <robertmaxrees> could you try rephrasing your question?
[19:51:29] <tona> for example https://jsfiddle.net/sgeto2dr/ , it doesnt show me C
[19:51:36] <tona> yes sorry,
[19:51:48] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:51:55] <tona> I would like to show C like my default choice
[19:51:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you include assets in jsfiddle...
[19:52:16] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:52:22] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you how to do this.
[19:52:48] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1. why use jquery to do this at all. 2. why not use the solution i just gave you?
[19:53:44] <robertmaxrees> you can just do <option value="c" selected>c</option>
[19:53:48] <tona> in fact of I put it there, but using the same jquery , it is not showing me the value expected  https://jsfiddle.net/sgeto2dr/
[19:53:49] <robertmaxrees> that'll set that option as selected.
[19:53:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:54:03] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools, yo.
[19:54:17] <Robdgreat> life is pain
[19:54:55] <robertmaxrees> you have scripts bombing out
[19:55:08] <robertmaxrees> and also: don't set selected the way you are now.
[19:55:24] <robertmaxrees> either just stick that attribute onto whatever option you want, or use .val()
[19:56:00] <tona> ok
[19:56:22] <robertmaxrees> but val() won't work becuase you have an external script erroring out.
[19:56:56] <Robdgreat> the question still stands: why are you using jquery at all for this?
[19:57:47] <tona> I tried to use vanilla js  using document.getelementbyID("select_distro").value="Ubuntu", but it doesnt put the value there
[19:57:54] <robertmaxrees> so again
[19:57:59] <Robdgreat> why are you using javascript for this?
[19:58:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[19:58:25] <tona> I only want to put one value there
[19:58:28] <tona> :)
[19:58:30] <robertmaxrees> again
[19:58:33] <robertmaxrees> why use JS?
[19:58:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of just putting selected on the element?
[19:58:42] <Robdgreat> why not just do it the standard way in the html?
[19:58:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fdeho2ys/1/
[19:59:12] <robertmaxrees> the page is still throwing errors but at least this functions.
[19:59:21] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: masochism is my guess
[19:59:32] <robertmaxrees> heh chill on the commentary pls ;)
[19:59:39] <Robdgreat> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:59:51] <robertmaxrees> sometimes there's a language barrier :)
[19:59:55] <Robdgreat> not like an answer is forthcoming
[20:00:01] * Robdgreat gets back to work
[20:00:29] <tona> I want to manipulate it dynamically not use html instead , because it will change depending the parameter sent by one webservice
[20:00:53] <robertmaxrees> tona do you mean it could change based on something after the page loads?
[20:01:05] <tona> yes
[20:01:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[20:01:12] <robertmaxrees> that's all you had to say.
[20:01:24] <robertmaxrees> so your first order of business is to fix up the other errors firing on that page.
[20:04:03] <robertmaxrees> what is www.js?
[20:05:54] <robertmaxrees> tona
[20:07:25] <tona> I found some libraries in one link , I just copied them
[20:07:37] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[20:07:42] <robertmaxrees> where'd you find them?
[20:07:49] <robertmaxrees> did you include them for any reason?  or just because?
[20:08:32] <tona> I wanted to implement the idea the use  select multiple and on that example come that links
[20:08:42] <tona> I just copy them
[20:08:44] <robertmaxrees> what example?
[20:09:03] <tona> that is the problem one example I found the internet , I lose thre link
[20:09:13] <robertmaxrees> uhm
[20:09:36] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to implement a select multiple with a default?
[20:09:45] <robertmaxrees> becuase you only need jquery for that.
[20:09:57] <robertmaxrees> and i get the feeling you copied things you shouldn't have copied.
[20:10:19] <tona> yes and furthermore , I wanted  implement , when I click it leave it like my option and I could select more and leave them there
[20:10:31] <tona> yes you are right,
[20:10:34] <robertmaxrees> you lost me with the second half.
[20:10:42] <robertmaxrees> let's solve one issue at a time.
[20:10:57] <tona> but how could I change or set one value in one select dinmycally
[20:11:08] <robertmaxrees> i've already showed you how to do that.
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> just call .val() on the select.
[20:11:59] <tona> ok, , is there one way to implement  the same idea like my last link , avoiding link dont useful
[20:12:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:12:17] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm going to show you again and you're not going to use it.
[20:12:24] <robertmaxrees> because you've ignored everything I've given you so far.
[20:13:09] <robertmaxrees> this is the last time i'm going to show you: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4t02aydx/
[20:13:57] <tona> sorry my apologize ,
[20:14:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:14:41] <robertmaxrees> you should check out http://learn.jquery.com/ - starting with https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[22:43:46] <alturic> Hello. I'm trying to write a function with a condition inside that will stop further execution, but I can't seem to figure it out. I thought I could return false on the condition not passing, and return true on the condition passing. But apparently that's not correct.
[22:44:03] <robertmaxrees> can you show us the code?
[22:44:20] <robertmaxrees> and clarify what you mean by "stop further execution"?
[22:44:22] <alturic> I thought I could do that because returning false when wrapped inside of an condition outside of a function does exactly that, stops execution of further code.
[22:50:35] <alturic> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/1/ - So in the bottom half of that example, I can achieve what I'm looking to do, but I was trying to get away from making a bunch of conditionals to handle it, and let a function handle it.
[22:51:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:51:10] <robertmaxrees> once you hit a return, you're done.
[22:51:25] <robertmaxrees> so you can't do what you want.
[22:54:40] <alturic> Well wait. Couldn't I just do this then: https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/3/ ?
[22:54:59] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[22:55:11] <alturic> So if the first     checkIfAccumulationIsValid('rain', the_rain_input_selector);   returned false, it wouldn't even attempt the second?
[22:55:13] <robertmaxrees> you're only returning from checkIfAccumulationIsValid
[22:55:27] <robertmaxrees> it'll still execute both.
[22:56:06] <alturic> So there's no way for a function call's return false; to stop further execution?
[22:56:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:56:19] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing up concepts.
[22:56:55] <robertmaxrees> what you're asking and what you're looking for are two different things.
[22:57:06] <alturic> So what would the proper approach be to do something like: https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/3/ - Where if the "rain" check failed, it didn't even attempt the "snow" one let alone console.log?
[22:57:45] <robertmaxrees> that's what if/else if/else is for.
[22:58:18] <alturic> So if I wanted to check rain, snow, ice, snow_elevation, ice_elevation the actual solution is a mess of conditionals? :-/
[22:58:36] <robertmaxrees> with the way you've written it here, yes.
[22:58:37] <alturic> 5 conditionals right there, and even more in the grand scope of needing to check it.
[22:58:49] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like maybe there's a cleaner way to do what you want.  i'd need more context though.
[22:59:10] <alturic> See, that's what I would do, but I said wait, this is messy as heck let's make a simple function and pass in the selector to do the check.
[22:59:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you checking?
[22:59:29] <alturic> An input's .val()
[22:59:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:59:38] <robertmaxrees> context, yo.
[22:59:45] <robertmaxrees> give some more deets.
[22:59:47] <alturic> Well first I'm checking if the selector is disabled, then I'm checking if the .val() is equal to "-0.2"
[22:59:55] <robertmaxrees> what are you builing.
[23:00:28] <robertmaxrees> *building?
[23:00:39] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do some validation?
[23:00:44] <alturic> So literally, without that function, I'd have a bunch of this: https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/4/
[23:00:53] <robertmaxrees> k good luck :)
[23:01:08] <alturic> Well, I wouldn't consider it "simple" validation, since I also want to check if the selector is disabled.
[23:01:21] <robertmaxrees> where did I use the word simple?
[23:01:31] <alturic> So when I started seeing a bunch of if statements, it made me pause and think there had to be a better way, such as a function.
[23:01:39] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you have two discrete checks.
[23:01:57] <robertmaxrees> you want to first check if the selector is disabled (which should happen before you get to where you're at now)
[23:02:11] <robertmaxrees> and then you want an array of validity statuses.
[23:02:22] <robertmaxrees> and then you can just array.every or however.
[23:02:26] <robertmaxrees> *however you want to handle it.
[23:06:14] <alturic> Right, so I'm on the part of doing those two discrete checks, since I tried getting around a bunch of conditionals like (https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/4/), and apparently it's not possible to have a function stop further execution with a return, I need another way. Surely that other way wouldn't be two functions and doing this: https://jsfiddle.net
[23:06:15] <alturic> /0u2eh936/5/
[23:06:28] <robertmaxrees> dude
[23:06:31] <robertmaxrees> stop
[23:06:50] <robertmaxrees> it feels like you're purposefully misphrasing what you're looking for.
[23:07:04] <robertmaxrees> "it's not possible to have a function stop further execution with a return" is an absurd statement and you know it.
[23:07:17] <alturic> Oh, I would totally agree with you that someone who has a deep understanding of jQuery would know the proper words to use... but... :-/
[23:07:29] <robertmaxrees> except this isn't a jquery issue.
[23:07:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a javascript issue.
[23:07:40] <robertmaxrees> you're fighting the language, not the library.
[23:08:27] <alturic> Well here's my reasoning for saying that. I can absolutely do this https://jsfiddle.net/0u2eh936/4/ and it works exactly as expected. As soon as the first conditional returns false, it doesn't even get to the further executions. That's what I mean by "stop further execution with a return". :(
[23:08:43] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[23:08:46] <alturic> So I apologize if that's not using the correct wording. I'm not purposely being difficult.
[23:09:11] <robertmaxrees> do you understand waht the difference is between doing that and just shoving a bunch of returns one right after the other?
[23:09:25] <alturic> Apparently not. *shutters*
[23:09:54] <robertmaxrees> when you wrap something in an if, you're checking a condition.  if that condition doesn't pass, the associated block doesn't execute.
[23:10:05] <alturic> Correct.
[23:10:06] <robertmaxrees> so the return within that branch doesn't get run.
[23:10:08] <alturic> So there's no return.
[23:10:10] <alturic> Yep.
[23:10:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[23:10:23] <robertmaxrees> do you see how that's at all distinct from what you keep saying?>
[23:11:16] <alturic> I mean, honestly, not really. I was simply trying to have a function handle the conditional so I don't have them all over, and I simply call the function passing in the selector.
[23:11:41] <alturic> I figured, oh the function could simply return false and it's the same thing. I'm just calling a function instead of a bunch of conditionals back to back. I'd call the same function back to back.
[23:11:46] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[23:11:47] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[23:11:52] <robertmaxrees> you're getting WAY ahead of yourself.
[23:11:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cxgkupaw/
[23:12:08] <robertmaxrees> notice how 'foo' never gets logged to the console here?
[23:12:22] <alturic> Correct.
[23:12:35] <robertmaxrees> so if you put a return in there, that doesn't get evaluated either, right?
[23:12:59] <alturic> Correct, because nothing inside the condition was executed.
[23:13:04] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[23:13:22] <robertmaxrees> now if you pull that out of the if statement, nothing is stopping the return from getting executed.
[23:13:26] <robertmaxrees> so it runs.
[23:13:40] <robertmaxrees> as soon as a return statement runs, the function is over.
[23:13:44] <robertmaxrees> nothing else happens.
[23:15:55] <robertmaxrees> now, since you only care if one or more elements meet a certain predicate, there's are a few simple ways to get something similar to what you're trying to do now.
[23:18:12] <alturic> I think I'm beginning to (possibly...) see the light. I can't simply call `runFunction(checkThis)` and have the function `return false;` to stop execution. I still would have to have an `if(runFunction(thingToCheck) { return false; }` to actually stop execution.
[23:18:30] <alturic> Man, it's like markdown works but it includes the markdown tags. Ha.
[23:18:45] <alturic> I guess it has to for actual clients. Anyway.
[23:19:00] <robertmaxrees> the return only impacts the current function you're inside of.
[23:19:01] <robertmaxrees> now.
[23:19:21] <robertmaxrees> you can accomplish what you want, you're just using a hammer when you want a screwdriver.
