[01:09:23] <Evidlo> Is it necessary to wait for page load before doing .on() or .click()?
[01:14:54] <Evidlo> it is
[05:06:13] <ExeciN> how can I get GET variables straight from the URL?
[05:29:23] <W0LF> anyone available to take a gander at a bpaste this js extreme-novice has made where the components seem to work, but js aggregation no longer works and all js fails when it's enabled?
[06:08:06] <lounge-user> Hi is class as selector for jQuery UI depreceated or am I doing something severely wrong?
[06:48:19] <EriC^^> hi i have a system(long running program) in an index.php file, and it keeps the page hanging til the results come back, i want to let the page load and show the results as they become available, i was told to try using jquery to launch the program, i'm doing that using $.load(launchprogram.php) but the page doesn't appear, when it's done everything is shown at once
[06:50:16] <localh0st> EriC^^: it's hanging because of DOM loading/downloading data from the PHP script, I'd suggest you to show the loader screen until complete ajax call would not load complete data and load complete HTML document, after that you could just hide loader and underneath you would have ready to scroll page
[06:51:19] <EriC^^> localh0st: can't i show the data as it becomes available?
[06:51:49] <EriC^^> i have another site that runs something and jquery shows it fine, just i dont run the program from the .php it's always running parsing
[06:52:45] <FilipNortic_> EriC^^: where is the time being spent if it's at backend fetching data it will send all to client sida in one go
[06:53:37] <EriC^^> FilipNortic_: so i need to call the long running program from something other than jquery?
[06:53:51] <EriC^^> let me try without the site, i just run the program manually and see if it works nicely
[06:53:58] <FilipNortic_> no you need to fix the long running program
[06:54:18] <FilipNortic_> cause it's sending the data to the browser
[06:54:31] <FilipNortic_> and it won't send any util it's done with all
[06:54:42] <localh0st> FilipNortic_: it's not always possible to do...
[06:55:07] <FilipNortic_> no but in that case there isn't much you can do at all
[06:55:58] <FilipNortic_> if the endpoint function takes to long that's what you should check first
[06:56:04] <localh0st> FilipNortic_: he won't optimze it, he want make UX smoother
[06:56:12] <localh0st> EriC^^: is it right?
[06:56:56] <EriC^^> FilipNortic_: no the wrong running program is flushing the stuff as it's writing them, if i tail the file i see output increasing always
[06:57:25] <EriC^^> i tried to disable the jquery call now, but somehow it still made the output file and creating the stuff, so maybe i have another call somewhere!
[06:57:26] <EriC^^> 1 sec
[06:58:16] <FilipNortic_> is it a submit you trying to optimize? sounded like page load
[07:00:26] <EriC^^> FilipNortic_: it's submit yes
[07:00:46] <FilipNortic_> ok then you need to over write the default submit event
[07:01:10] <FilipNortic_> otherwise the whole page will reload if you have a button inside a form
[07:02:22] <FilipNortic_> EriC^^:  and you wouldn't need to reload anything since you already have the data you should just set up  a new item in the callback to the ajax call you're submitting with
[07:02:27] <EriC^^> FilipNortic_: well it's not really just submit sometimes the page will be loaded from a GET
[07:02:45] <FilipNortic_> the whole page?
[07:02:51] <EriC^^> yup
[07:02:57] <FilipNortic_> why?
[07:03:06] <EriC^^> i mean like there's a site, you add some letters it becomes this site
[07:03:11] <EriC^^> cause it's a tool
[07:03:24] <EriC^^> for some odd reason, the parser is running, and 4 instances of it
[07:03:51] <FilipNortic_> yeah but with ajax the idee generally is to just load the what you need
[07:04:09] <FilipNortic_> and do it in small drips
[07:04:50] <FilipNortic_> well my guess is that you're submitting the whole page then have to wait for the page reload
[07:05:13] <EriC^^> the site is here, http://www.youtubextras.com/watch?v=L79SMQiCVQc
[07:05:43] <EriC^^> i can't figure out what's calling the parser, i removed it from the index.php :/
[07:09:15] <EriC^^> i removed it instead of commenting, it's not running in ps aux
[07:09:18] <EriC^^> let me try again
[07:10:06] <EriC^^> it's still loading, how on earth
[07:11:00] <EriC^^> oh duh, it's using watch.php instead of index.php
[07:11:24] <Woet> EriC^^: did you not read the youtube terms and conditions?
[07:11:54] <EriC^^> Woet: are you a lawyer?
[07:12:05] <Woet> EriC^^: no, I'm just capable of reading.
[07:12:50] <EriC^^> ok are you capable of lessening the judgement kind of stuff too?
[07:13:47] <Woet> EriC^^: i don't see why
[07:14:25] <EriC^^> if you say so
[08:07:16] <neo_> hi guys
[08:07:31] <neo_> how change language on google map ?
[08:07:40] <neo_> see this code https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/WEboZW
[08:08:06] <neo_> I add there &language=iw and it's not change language , why ?
[08:29:14] <EriC^^> in a $.get do i absolutely have to put something at the end? $.get('something', data, thisrighthere) ?
[08:45:16] <Kartagis> EriC^^: I don't think data is necessary
[08:45:30] <EriC^^> Kartagis: thanks
[08:45:33] <Kartagis> what is thisrighthere?
[08:46:20] <FilipNortic_> jQuery.get( url [, data ] [, success ] [, dataType ] )
[08:46:37] <EriC^^> Kartagis: the thing i'm asking about if i can just not put it there
[08:46:53] <FilipNortic_> the things in [] are optional
[08:47:05] <Kartagis> FilipNortic_ says it is optional
[08:48:51] <FilipNortic_> EriC^^: just check the api pages and you can see there examples
[08:50:05] <EriC^^> aha thanks guys
[08:52:52] <EriC^^> ok i got it working! thanks a ton to everyone who helped
[09:14:11] <Kartagis> np
[09:34:45] <sigdk> Hello. I'm using this plugin: https://fooplugins.com/plugins/footable-jquery/    which provides responsiveness to tables. The statement I use is the following: $(".myTable").footable();  Question: is this call synchronous? Meaning, I do the call, the function returns and I continue, or does it apply the footable asynchronous?
[09:34:49] <sigdk> *ly
[09:35:20] <Darren_> http://kaylagotchased.com/#!/Hotels trying to figure out why my book now button keeps triggering a jquery error in console, it's just a normal link
[09:42:38] <iaj> Hey folks! Does someone have a handy solution for imitating a lever on a page that can be pulled down with the mouse?
[10:16:52] <galgamach> Hi all.  :-)    I have a big on my page and when clicking on the search box in Android (only) devices, the keyboard appears and in one second disappears again. I believe it is some kind of Android loosing focus. I'm looking for a fix. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you
[10:36:30] <W0LF> anyone available to have a look at some short js and see where this super-novice coder might've borked up aggregation? the small pieces all work, but something ruins aggregation
[10:57:55] <FilipNortic_> W0LF: don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[10:59:56] <MikeD_> aggregation?  that sounds like something for SQL to do :)
[11:00:24] <MikeD_> but now I'm curious, so post a fiddle ?
[11:00:33] <W0LF> i put up a bpaste of my files here - https://bpaste.net/show/2aab2cc8e55a
[11:00:58] <W0LF> trouble is, i'm not even sure how/where to start...
[11:02:06] <MikeD_> given that spew, i'm not sure either
[11:03:46] <FilipNortic_> the fixheader function seems wired
[11:04:26] <W0LF> i've tried eliminating one by one, and enabling/disabling js aggregation to see what breaks it, but i can't understand the errors thrown out in chrome console
[11:04:42] <FilipNortic_> what are you aggregating?
[11:04:46] <W0LF> FilipNortic_ : is there a better way to write it? honestly I copied most everything from somewhere else
[11:05:16] <W0LF> FilipNortic_ : i'm just trying to enable drupal core js aggregation on the site - but when I do almost all js instantly breaks
[11:05:35] <W0LF> if I don't have js aggregation enabled everything seems to work fine independently though
[11:05:55] <MikeD_> oh, that's not what I thought "aggregation" meant... i was thinking of a count() or a sum() or similar
[11:06:37] <FilipNortic_> well it claims you have bad location in a href somewhere
[11:06:46] <FilipNortic_> but i can't find it in the code
[11:07:37] <W0LF> aye, i researched that online and it suggests something is wrong in a view...but I can't find anything in common on the pages that error pops up that seem like they could cause it
[11:09:19] <FilipNortic_> well odds are it's there somewhere
[11:11:36] <W0LF> would you suggest cloning and slowly dismantling a view until the error disappears or is there a better way?
[11:11:38] <FilipNortic_> W0LF: 	$(#block-tools, #search-block-form)
[11:11:46] <FilipNortic_> is missing qutes
[11:11:51] <FilipNortic_> qoutes
[11:12:00] <FilipNortic_> i can't spell today
[11:15:22] <FilipNortic_> W0LF: and it looks like som of your functions are cloesd by wrong / missing closing brackets
[11:18:03] <W0LF> are the first two view blocks? and i'm a super novice at js - which ones are missing brackets - is there an easy way to tell in a text editor like notepad++?
[11:18:23] <W0LF> sounds like the missing closing brackets might be breaking the js aggregation
[11:19:16] <W0LF> FilipNortic_: ^sorry =]
[11:19:38] <FilipNortic_> try copy pasting into jsfiddle
[11:19:54] <FilipNortic_> one file at a time
[11:21:36] <W0LF> FilipNortic_ : ok I did the first one, and hit run but nothing happened
[11:21:46] <W0LF> is there a debug tool I'm missing?
[11:22:02] <W0LF> i don't see anything in the colors to denote missing brackets, etc.
[11:22:10] <FilipNortic_> click tidy
[11:22:35] <FilipNortic_> and then you can but the cusor over diffent brackets and see if they are unclosed
[11:24:06] <W0LF> clicked tidy, and hovering over diff elements in the javascript portion where I posted the code, but nothing shows up
[11:24:17] <W0LF> i'll try a different snippet
[11:24:54] <W0LF> ah i see, it underlines the start and end ones
[11:26:09] <FilipNortic_> well i'm heading out now hopefully you can solve it
[11:26:20] <W0LF> thanks for the tip!
[11:26:25] <W0LF> FilipNortic_++
[11:33:30] <W0LF> i've saved a fiddle here with functional, but erroneous code due to a missing bracket or parentheses somewhere
[11:33:33] <W0LF> https://jsfiddle.net/4p4h8eev/
[11:33:48] <W0LF> just started dabbling in js and could use another pair of eyes
[12:01:10] <rapha> Hi!
[12:02:04] <rapha> Is there some plugin for automatically loading more HTML fragments via XMLHttpRequest until there's no vertical whitespace left? Or is that something I should rather try and figure out myself?
[12:05:34] <rapha> I was thinking that I'll measure the height of my containing element and the height of <body>, and while the former is less than the latter I keep loading the URL of the next <a> inside of the <ul> containing all the links and appending it at the end of the container...?
[12:30:55] <AwkwardCough> W0LF: get it figured out?
[12:41:15] <mad_moses> hi, do you know a jquery plugin which has a similar behavior like html5 input type="number" steps="0.5" ?
[14:14:21] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[15:46:16] <MACscr> jquery equivalent of var formy = document.getElementById("product_customizer"); ?
[15:46:42] <MACscr> seems when i do $('#product_customizer'), i get an object instead
[15:47:48] <MACscr> oops, nvm, google to the rescue
[15:48:49] <MikeD_> i built a product customizer for pgiproducts.com
[15:49:19] <MikeD_> several, tbh, because they sell a lot of trinkets
[15:57:33] <robertmaxrees> nice
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> product customization and configuration is a PITA
[19:12:10] <robertmaxrees> so quiet today
[19:47:01] <sla3k> Hi, I want to save the content of value.txt in a variable and call that variable outside the scope of function, is that possible? https://pastebin.com/37L9rdP9
[21:45:31] <WhirledPress> How can I tell if i have a handler function bound to an event?
[21:47:51] <WhirledPress> for example, I have five elements that need to listen to a cusom event fired by another element. So for that event, I trigger the same event in all of the listeners.
[22:29:14] <WhirledPress> if you bind an event using .on, then later use .off to unbind event how does it know which event handler to unbind if there are multiple event handlers?
[23:01:40] <jsieler[m]> Hi all
[23:51:08] <kaptaindt> .
