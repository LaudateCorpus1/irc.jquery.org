[00:07:20] <Salman> is there a oncreate event in jquery?
[00:11:36] <systemfault> oncreate would be the line after :P
[00:17:37] <Salman> i have elements like <div class="abc"> text </div>, how can i hide them on creation? They're being created dynamically
[00:17:50] <Salman> in html
[00:20:49] <systemfault> Salman: The easy way out is to add a new css rule .abc { display: none; }
[00:57:26] <sunuslee> hi, in jqm's autocomplete. can i make a wildcard to data-filtertext ? so that no matter what use type, there's always one entry in the top of the result list
[01:47:55] <didiergm> on jqm I want to do some form dynamic generation. I can send the form description via ajax/json w/o problem; but I also have so specific functions like 'onclick' or onblur to implement. These are clearly field dependent. afaik json does not accept function so what could you suggest ? use getscript and dynamically  generate de page container & the form ? any other idea ?
[01:48:24] <didiergm> *generate the page*
[01:52:52] <sadtaco> I'm getting a "Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'" but it doesn't show a line or anything.  That's all the error ...
[01:55:28] <sadtaco> Ah looks like it was from another window, or some cross scripting attempt
[01:55:42] <[E]sc> after dynamically adding content, the jquery doesn't get binded to the new content, how can i achieve that? is it a selector problem? I am using the bind function
[01:55:54] <lazarus> Hi
[01:56:13] <GoSox> i feel kind of bad ass when I sign in to IRC anticipating need help with something, only to figure it all out on my own :D
[02:04:45] <GoSox> i sure wish apple would fix safari 6
[02:05:17] <GoSox> Safari 6 is like OS X Lion. It's primary feature is it's ability to significantly slow down your workflow.
[02:05:50] <lazarus> hi
[02:05:58] <lazarus> id like to learn more jquery
[02:06:02] <lazarus> howdo
[02:06:07] <GoSox> there's a website for that
[02:06:49] <lazarus> which
[02:06:53] <GoSox> jquery.com
[02:06:57] <lazarus> I need books
[02:07:04] <GoSox> i don't know of any
[02:07:09] <GoSox> but i'm sure there are tons
[02:07:22] <j_wright> amazon has a search
[02:07:52] <GoSox> Safari also has a search, but it sucks because it instantly auto-fills any matching URLs it finds
[02:08:03] <lazarus> GoSox why dont you
[02:08:11] <GoSox> why don't I what?
[02:08:12] <lazarus> Apply for dev at safari
[02:08:21] <lazarus> and then you can actually affect these things
[02:08:23] <GoSox> well mainly because I don't know Objective-C
[02:08:28] <lazarus> Rather than whining about it
[02:08:30] <lazarus> LRN IT
[02:08:43] <GoSox> i've made the life decision to focus on web programming instead of desktop programming
[02:10:16] <lazarus> GoSox may i ask whu
[02:10:18] <lazarus> why
[02:11:23] <GoSox> when iOS apps started getting popular, and I tried to learn Objective C. But it was very difficult, and apple is constantly changing everything. So it quickly became clear that it wasn't something I could do casually. I had to commit to either spend all my free time leaning and coding apps, or forget about it and stick to web.
[02:11:43] <GoSox> And I didn't want to give up my websites, so that was that.
[02:11:45] <lazarus> OOP is best learned with Cpp
[02:11:49] <lazarus> not obj C
[02:12:02] <lazarus> in my experience that is
[02:12:18] <GoSox> i had a friend make some basic iOS apps for my sites, i pulled them from the app store, let my paid dev account expire, and went back to web only mobile apps
[02:12:25] <lazarus> Obj C is too objective
[02:12:36] <GoSox> OOP is best learned by someone else
[02:12:42] <GoSox> i'm sticking to web
[02:12:45] <GoSox> i like it
[02:12:46] <GoSox> it likes me
[02:13:00] <GoSox> it most likely has a long future ahead
[02:13:10] <GoSox> one of my sites is quite popular
[02:13:14] <j_wright> yeah, there's no OOP in web, heh
[02:13:14] <GoSox> so its all good
[02:13:29] <GoSox> in web, you have a choice
[02:13:50] <GoSox> if you could program iapps in straight C, i'd have an army of popular apps
[02:13:54] <lazarus> Inb4 html6 Oop
[02:15:04] <lazarus> is the domain html6.com registered?
[02:15:28] <GoSox> replace "html6.com" with any domain name you can think of, and the answer is yes.
[02:16:09] <GoSox> i wish there was a way to take over domains that are unused or parked, without paying the absurd selling prices these guys want
[02:16:18] <GoSox> i have an unused domain, i'd happily sell it for $100
[02:16:24] <GoSox> and it has like 6 years left on it
[02:24:17] <sadtaco> http://pastebin.com/FxER4unG Is there any reason why I shouldn't do this?
[02:29:05] <GoSox> every time i find a browser bug with .svg images, i die a little
[02:30:23] <whatever_42> hey guys. any ideas why this code works on a pc but doesn't on my ipad?
[02:30:40] <sadtaco> Shit browser on the ipad maybe?
[02:31:04] <whatever_42> i tried both safari and icab
[02:31:18] <GoSox> webkit is a shit browser?
[02:31:20] <GoSox> thats harsh
[02:32:01] <whatever_42> nevertheless it used to work ones.
[02:32:09] <aMoniker> webkit is probably the best browser currently
[02:32:11] <Gazpacho> "this code"
[02:32:14] <aMoniker> well, browser engine
[02:32:20] <GoSox> whatever_42: you realize you haven't linked to anything yet?
[02:32:24] <whatever_42> oh
[02:32:26] <whatever_42> http://pastebin.com/qmnu6yeA
[02:32:34] <whatever_42> sry i always miss that
[02:32:41] <GoSox> aMoniker: i agree, although firefox is essentially just as good
[02:32:44] <GoSox> they're so close
[02:32:53] <GoSox> compared toâ€¦ the browser that shan't be named
[02:33:27] <aMoniker> GoSox: It used to be, but chrome development has several advantages now
[02:33:37] <aMoniker> not bad by any means though
[02:33:48] <sadtaco> The iphone browser has the same JS support as the most recent Safari/Chrome? I didn't know then
[02:34:08] <aMoniker> for development... Chrome > Firefox > Safari > IE9 > Opera
[02:34:16] <GoSox> firefox has the best support of CSS columns, a feature that I lovvvvvve. And firefox is the only browser that supports printing of css columns. Its funny when you print a css column page in safari, the columns just go away
[02:34:58] <sadtaco> I usually develope on FF since if it works on FF it'll usually work fine on Chrome. :/
[02:35:05] <whatever_42> how about we move this conversation to after we found a solution?^^
[02:35:12] <sadtaco> Not always true the other way around and I get lost tracking an obscure bug thousands of lines later
[02:35:14] <GoSox> meh fiiiiiiine
[02:35:29] <air_> the most annoying things are when you try to make webapps that need sound synchronized to something that happens.
[02:35:35] <air_> html5 audio doesn't seem mature enough.
[02:35:39] <air_> and ff doesn't like mp3.
[02:36:00] <GoSox> air_: yeah all my sounds are .ogg and .mp3
[02:36:01] <air_> and ios does their own webaudio api.
[02:36:07] <MickRip_> this might be a javascript question rather than a jq question - but is there an expression in javascript which resembles  var foo = (150 || this.bar) // .. where it will evalate as 150 if this.bar is null or false?
[02:36:28] <GoSox> air_: i only do simple short sound effects, nothing too elaborate
[02:36:51] <air_> GoSox: we tend to use soundmanager2 (which then uses flash) to avoid the shortcomings of other solutions.
[02:37:23] <air_> With custom solution for ios of course.
[02:37:29] <GoSox> i use simple html5 audio elements with both a .ogg and .mp3 source and it works really well on a wide array of browsers
[02:37:33] <air_> (but it means we don't need to work with ogg for now)
[02:37:59] <GoSox> having two copies of all audio are annoying, but not much more than just an annoyance
[02:38:36] <air_> yes, it's fair enough.
[02:38:54] <GoSox> but if i had multi-megabyte audio, i'd be very annoyed
[02:39:12] <GoSox> 53kb is my entire audio folder :)
[02:39:14] <air_> but synchronizing animations to sound or the other way around is pretty much not working with html5 audio for now.
[02:39:24] <air_> GoSox: good for you, I do in fact have lots and lots.
[02:39:25] <air_> :)
[02:39:37] <GoSox> yeah i've noticed that. i play the audio first because of that
[02:39:40] <GoSox> to try to get it more in sync
[02:40:03] <GoSox> air_: http://www.whatsmyip.org/statistical-accuracy/ click on the chart
[02:40:04] <MickRip_> GoSox: I wrote a quick API once which used to just render from .wav using command line .. with a zillion sfx, it was so much easier in the long run!
[02:41:30] <air_> GoSox: :)
[02:41:51] <whatever_42> so? why does this code http://pastebin.com/qmnu6yeA not work on mobilesafari but does on firefox?
[02:41:57] <GoSox> air_: 83% of html5 audio plays fine :)
[02:42:11] <air_> GoSox: yeah it works for one sound, etc. but it's an issue in more advanced cases.
[02:42:23] <GoSox> air_: that was a joke based on the content of that page :)
[02:42:29] <didiergm> Mickrip_ it's the reverse this.bar || 150
[02:42:31] <air_> yeah, I understood. :)
[02:42:40] <MickRip_> didiergm: I figured it out about 20 seconds ago ;)
[02:42:52] <air_> I thought it was a good statistics on the likelyness of your sound being played at the correct time :P
[02:42:58] <MickRip_> didiergm: but thanks!
[02:42:59] <air_> each hit is another story.
[02:43:06] <didiergm> Mickrip_ 20secs ago I was afk
[02:43:09] <didiergm> :)
[02:43:44] <GoSox> people are generally very against sound on web pages. but i feel like a little subtle sound can add a lot to a site
[02:43:50] <air_> there really are not that many webapps I know of that nicely demonstrate synchronized sound to actions.
[02:43:54] <GoSox> i'm not advocating everyone's website look like their old myspace page
[02:44:19] <air_> GoSox: yeah, I'm all against it as well. except that I work with webapps for education, where sounds is a necessity.
[02:44:45] <air_> language training, translations, just sounds to make simple games more interesting, etc.
[02:44:58] <GoSox> some of my network tools take a while to run. it's nice having a subtle sound for completion of a test, and another sound for failure
[02:45:06] <air_> but for regular pages / webapps, there's seldom a need for it.
[02:45:30] <MickRip_> air_: impossible; I researched. I wanted to make a roll-your-own soundtrack where I could combine sounds kinda like a poor man's .mod format, and it fell in a heap
[02:46:18] <air_> MickRip_: yeah, the only nice solutions available are stuff based on chrome-only things for example.
[02:46:37] <air_> you've seen this? http://www.jamwithchrome.com/
[02:46:40] <MickRip_> air_: yeah, those things rule!
[02:46:58] <MickRip_> air_: is that the one wth the circles and the pentonic scale thingy? (with the node.js bakcend?)
[02:47:27] <air_> it's an "play your instrument with friends" multiplayer thingie.
[02:47:34] <air_> likely a node backend, I'm not sure.
[02:47:35] <MickRip_> yep, so cool!
[02:47:49] <air_> http://goo.gl/PaoBq
[02:48:02] <air_> yeah, it's impressive.
[02:49:52] <MickRip_> there's even filters in the spec I think. So you could make some pretty cool sounds with just a square wave
[02:50:23] <MickRip_> unfortunately you can't *truley* loop mp3
[02:50:37] <GoSox> Just think. If IE had never gotten popular, where we are today with the web, we would have been years ago.
[02:51:32] <air_> well, there was this one impressive html5 game demo made by microsoft to show the features if ie10 IIRC.
[02:51:45] <air_> anyone remember what I'm referring to? I can't remember the name.
[02:51:57] <GoSox> i feel like anything ms does with IE is too little, too late
[02:52:18] <GoSox> you want to make a standards compliant browser? where were you when your browser has 95% market share?
[02:52:26] <GoSox> had*
[02:52:38] <air_> http://www.contrejour.ie/
[02:52:49] <GoSox> now they want to make one, but now know one gives a shit. thank you webkit and firefox
[02:53:42] <air_> afk, lunchtime, bbl.
[02:54:18] <MickRip_> I've had no real probs with ie10 .. but it took MS this long for me to say that
[02:54:32] <GoSox> i've had some issues, i think mostly css stuff
[02:54:36] <GoSox> less than previous versions
[02:54:45] <GoSox> but at this point
[02:54:52] <GoSox> and given their track record
[02:55:02] <GoSox> i sure hope IE10 doesn't catch on
[02:55:18] <MickRip_> GoSox: reckon win8 will catch on? :P
[02:55:25] <GoSox> heh
[02:55:38] <GoSox> on desktop, eventually. win 8 mobileâ€¦ poor microsoft
[02:56:04] <GoSox> unlike desktop in the 90s, when it comes to mobile, people aren't simply looking for the cheapest solutions out there. people want the BEST solutions out there
[02:56:33] <GoSox> whether you are an iOS guy or an Android guy, you definitely aren't a win mobile guy
[02:57:17] <MickRip_> doesn't seem like a fruitful investment of your time
[02:57:30] <GoSox> what doesn't?
[02:57:36] <MickRip_> *win mobile
[02:57:40] <GoSox> oh, well yeah
[02:58:03] <GoSox> and back to IE, i've been saying for years, MS should just use webkit as their renderer, and just make a wrapper for it. Or discontinue IE all together
[02:58:21] <GoSox> there's not a lot of downside for them doing this
[02:58:28] <MickRip_> GoSox: yeah like google frame
[02:58:56] <MickRip_> *chrome frame
[02:59:27] <GoSox> or iCab, or OmniWeb, or any one of MANY webkit browsers out there, that aren't Safari or Chrome
[02:59:31] <MickRip_> GoSox: I find modern Opera gives me more issue than modern ie (generally)
[02:59:47] <GoSox> i do very little testing with opera these days since NO ONE uses it
[02:59:54] <GoSox> maybe 2%, on a good month
[03:00:29] <GoSox> on the website i'm working on tonight, 0.1% opera
[03:00:32] <MickRip_> it's just weird with tables when you don't specify the widths on the TD
[03:00:56] <GoSox> on my very popular website, its an even 2% for the month
[03:01:00] <GoSox> and IE is down to 17.3%
[03:01:04] <GoSox> joyus!
[03:02:11] <MickRip_> Opera probably deserves more than 2%, even though I don't use it
[03:02:48] <MickRip_> in my experience, the linux version of opera is actually more robust than chrome linux
[03:03:10] <GoSox> Safari Chrome or Firefox. They're all so good, that that's a pretty good set of options. And with Opera historically being the worst non-IE browserâ€¦ id be happy to let it die
[03:03:28] <StephenS> hey guys when I call header() in php via ajax, whole page is loaded in one div, how can I just refresh whole page so user get instantly logged.
[03:03:44] <StephenS> I fixed that with js window.location, however user can just disable js..
[03:03:56] <MickRip_> GoSox: well, we'd all prefer ONE browser ideally, which would instantly not work if the version was too old :)
[03:04:18] <GoSox> auto-upgrading chrome and firefox is so right, and so awesome
[03:04:31] <GoSox> StephenS: i don't understand what you are doing? when you say you call a php function via ajax?
[03:04:42] <MickRip_> StephenS: do you just want to refresh a div?
[03:04:44] <StephenS> I do, well on sign up page
[03:04:48] <StephenS> No, I want opposite
[03:05:28] <StephenS> I have div lets say error, and on successful login creds, I call header() which is redirect in php and error div  is updated with his info, however rest of page still remain with register form
[03:05:40] <StephenS> I thought updating whole body with php code, but dunno is it going to work
[03:06:07] <GoSox> yeah i think on my page like that, i do a refresh in javascript
[03:06:10] <GoSox> of the current url
[03:06:15] <MickRip_> StephenS: time for a re-think, I think :) ..
[03:06:26] <MickRip_> StephenS: what's your validator?
[03:06:39] <StephenS> GoSox, I do it with js refresh, but what if user disable js, he can just spam my registration page..
[03:06:56] <StephenS> MickRip_, function(response) { } //if response == done, redirect
[03:06:59] <StephenS> thats validator.
[03:07:12] <GoSox> StephenS: Nope I take it back. What i did to get proper autocomplete behavior, is have my login form submit to a php, not using ajax. Then that php logs you in and sends you back to the page you came from. All very fast.
[03:07:29] <GoSox> but since so much changes when you are logged in, it seems like the best way to handle logging in
[03:07:39] <StephenS> GoSox, I currenyly do have that, however what if creds are wrong.
[03:07:49] <StephenS> It wont be sleek and with ajax, it will go through form submissions.
[03:07:50] <GoSox> i pre-check those with javascript
[03:07:57] <MickRip_> StephenS: You can valid ... what GoSox said
[03:07:57] <GoSox> if they are good, javascript lets the form submit normally
[03:08:15] <StephenS> how to check with pure js?
[03:08:17] <StephenS> never heard of it
[03:08:17] <GoSox> if your creds are wrong, you get an error tone and a message
[03:08:23] <MickRip_> StephenS: so effectively you are validating via your ajax API, and the top of the PHP page (Just to be safe)
[03:08:36] <GoSox> StephenS: with an http request to a php that only checks, and doesn't actually log you in
[03:08:49] <StephenS> xmlhttp?
[03:08:57] <GoSox> $.POST
[03:09:07] <StephenS> no $.ajax involved?
[03:09:13] <GoSox> $.post is $.ajax
[03:09:17] <MickRip_> $.post is a subset of $.,ajax
[03:09:21] <StephenS> so why not $.ajax
[03:09:27] <StephenS> ?$.post
[03:09:30] <StephenS> !?$.post
[03:09:41] <MickRip_> StephenS: they are teh same command .. you can do the same with $.ajax as you can with $.post (but not the other way around)
[03:09:41] <GoSox> i just prefer $.post, it's less code to write
[03:10:04] <StephenS> hmm I stil dont understad very well.
[03:10:15] <MickRip_> just use $.post ..
[03:10:26] <StephenS> I do request to ajaxlog.php with ajax, and then if response is anything else then done, It shows error okay?
[03:10:27] <GoSox> i can't figure out what you don't understand. you seem to know what $.ajax is. $.post if the same thing, so now you know what $.post is
[03:10:31] <StephenS> and if response is done then what?
[03:10:54] <GoSox> StephenS: you're going back to the way your doing it, and forgetting about the way i do it
[03:11:06] <StephenS> you just said you use $.post
[03:11:15] <MickRip_> StephenS: make the ajaxlog.php (is that your ajax call?) return an explicit value always
[03:11:28] <StephenS> MickRip_, yes ajaxlog.php is actually php code only
[03:11:36] <StephenS> and it returns values, like normal php form submission
[03:12:01] <MickRip_> StephenS: yep. Make it return a json string. good habit that way. And then javascript decide how to behave
[03:12:14] <StephenS> ugh?
[03:12:18] <StephenS> thats what I currently have
[03:12:21] <GoSox> StephenS: when a user submits the login form, you make an ajax request that loads a php that just CHECKS the user's credentials, but doesn't actually log them in. If the check fails, you post an error message. IF it's successful, you do nothing and let the login form submit normally. It submits to a php doc that does the loggin-in and instantly redirects (with a 301 header, not with html) back to the previous page. Presto.
[03:12:36] <GoSox> i hate json strings and i never use them :)
[03:12:46] <StephenS> I dont use json neither
[03:13:04] <StephenS> GoSox, I understand all except part "you do nothing and let the login form submit normally."
[03:13:07] <StephenS> how to do that?
[03:13:22] <GoSox> return true to the form's onSubmit and it keeps going
[03:13:24] <MickRip_> GoSox: god, i use it for everything!
[03:13:42] <GoSox> and this technique has the added benefit of being fully compatible with browsers' autofill features
[03:15:07] <StephenS> mkay
[03:15:11] <StephenS> ?$.post
[03:15:12] <GoSox> StephenS: so mines a little complicated. I have no submit button. so I actually listen on the inputs and if i get a return keystroke, i do teh check. And if the check passes, then I send the form a .submit() event
[03:15:12] <bot-t> StephenS, jQuery.post() | jQuery API Documentation - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[03:15:25] <MickRip_> StephenS: yeah, so perhaps do a $(form).submit() after checking
[03:15:31] <StephenS> nah I wont use that..
[03:15:39] <StephenS> MickRip_, good idea thanks yall
[03:15:40] <GoSox> it was very complicated to get it to work. i had to try 4 or 5 different ways before i found one that worked, and let auto-complete work too
[03:15:41] <StephenS> Ill try it right away
[03:16:21] <MickRip_> There's so many ways to skin that cat .. and you eventually find the best way which caters for the subtle changes of scenario you get from time to time
[03:17:00] <GoSox> i tried a lot, and i couldn't get autofill to see it as a form submission
[03:17:13] <GoSox> so it wouldn't ask to remember your credentials
[03:17:19] <GoSox> finally, the way i said above, it works
[03:18:34] <StephenS> ok
[03:18:35] <StephenS> lemme try
[03:19:19] <MickRip_> StephenS: just get it to work flawlessly without any ajax love. And then hook the ajax in which intercepts the form submission. That's how I would do it
[03:19:34] <StephenS> Yes I know
[03:19:38] <StephenS> It worked well with oure php
[03:20:15] <StephenS> hmmm
[03:20:26] <StephenS> It seems like simple submission form does not work
[03:20:40] <StephenS> if (response == "done") {
[03:20:41] <StephenS> 			$("#showerror").hide();
[03:20:41] <StephenS> 			$(this).submit();
[03:20:41] <StephenS> 		}
[03:20:55] <MickRip_> use jsfiddle
[03:21:03] * air_ is back.
[03:21:13] <GoSox> if your form has a submit button and you are using that to submit it, my technique might not work as-is
[03:21:14] <StephenS> its submitted via ajax, and member is signed up, however header() seems to not work
[03:21:26] <air_> what about unittesting and validating that things works properly in browsers?
[03:21:34] <MickRip_> StephenS: do you have an onSubmit event?
[03:21:44] <air_> Do you guys test manually, or do you have automatized tests for different browsers?
[03:21:54] <GoSox> StephenS: it sounds like you are still trying to log in via ajax
[03:21:58] <StephenS> MickRip_, why would I when my whole form is $(this) now
[03:22:23] <air_> I've considered looking into something like phantomjs for at least getting some basic automatized tests.
[03:22:33] <MickRip_> StephenS: paste your entire HTML page into pastebin or something
[03:22:33] <GoSox> air_: i have 4 differnet versions of windows, all in VMWare on my Mac. Each OS has different versions of common browsers
[03:22:48] <GoSox> each browsers start page is a page that forwards to whatever i'm working on
[03:23:08] <air_> GoSox: ditto, except, I transferred my vmware license to a mac mini server so my colleges can also test.
[03:23:21] <GoSox> i have no colleges :D
[03:23:27] <air_> :)
[03:23:31] <GoSox> colleagues
[03:23:40] <GoSox> i have neither
[03:25:27] <air_> :)
[03:25:38] <StephenS> MickRip_, onsubmit event?
[03:25:55] <MickRip_> StephenS: let me mock up something really quickly, back in 3
[03:27:46] <StephenS> here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13715081/jquery-ajax-login-form-submit-on-enter
[03:27:49] <StephenS> that same principe I use
[03:27:59] <StephenS> can you see whats wrong GoSox MickRip_
[03:28:38] <GoSox> don't do the login with ajax
[03:28:47] <StephenS> ...
[03:28:58] <GoSox> i thought we agreed that was the problem
[03:29:07] <StephenS> but how will I display errors then
[03:29:13] <GoSox> verify with ajax, login with plain old html/php
[03:29:25] <StephenS> do you have any example?
[03:29:41] <GoSox> just google any old "jquery verify form before submit"
[03:30:03] <StephenS> ah I know what you think
[03:30:08] <StephenS> I already have that :D
[03:30:13] <GoSox> and while most verification functions are going to be a string test, yours is going to be a $.post that tests the username and password but doesn't actually log in, just sees if their valid
[03:30:23] <StephenS> but if member click submit it will get him to the same errors he have upon validation
[03:30:49] <GoSox> i don't know what that means
[03:30:58] <MickRip_> StephenS: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/bU2hd/1/
[03:31:22] <MickRip_> that's not complete btw
[03:31:32] <GoSox> MickRip_: there you go. then just return a false on fail to stop the submission.
[03:31:55] <GoSox> and if verification passes, do nothing and let it go through normally
[03:32:02] <StephenS> that code MickRip_ refresh whole page
[03:32:05] <StephenS> does not display error
[03:32:22] <StephenS> GoSox, yeah I get what you think
[03:32:40] <StephenS> but I need to do that with every field
[03:32:45] <StephenS> which is frustrating for signup
[03:32:47] <GoSox> you need to put a check that returns false if the $.post tells you the data is invalid. that false will stop the form submission. then you can also display an error message
[03:32:53] <StephenS> I can do it for login though
[03:32:59] <GoSox> i don' tknow what you mean
[03:34:02] <StephenS> I know :D
[03:34:19] <StephenS> uhm how to hide that verification in file.js for example
[03:34:26] <MickRip_> StephenS: the submit event is really your secret to everything
[03:34:27] <StephenS> I have it on page but when I put it inside .js file it does not work
[03:35:14] <GoSox> i have to go to bed
[03:35:24] <whatever_42> so does anybody now have some time for my problem?
[03:35:24] <GoSox> and i never know what you say the first time
[03:35:26] <GoSox> its too much work
[03:36:02] <GoSox> whatever_42: honestly your sample code was too long for me to be able to look at quickly and understand, so i can't really help you with it. try to narrow down teh problem and make some simpler test codeâ€¦ for someone else
[03:36:25] <MickRip_> StephenS: paste your code into pastebin, that's the best way. It should be simple and succinct
[03:37:45] <StephenS> I see whats wrong possible I have php code inside js file :(
[03:37:55] <MickRip_> hehe
[03:37:58] <StephenS> how to include js with php code? :D
[03:38:11] <StephenS> except php's include, since that will just show up whole code on page
[03:40:26] <MickRip_> whatever_42: what was wrong with your js?
[03:40:33] <StephenS> MickRip_, any idea? I dont want others to see my code..
[03:41:07] <whatever_42> MickRip_: this one works in firefox yet it doesn't on mobilesafari http://pastebin.com/qmnu6yeA
[03:42:53] <MickRip_> StephenS: Start again. Make the form work without ajax. (a success will work as intended, a fail with just die()) .. and then create a jquery event "submit" with fires with you try to submit the form. It will do all of your checking.
[03:43:05] <MickRip_> whatever_42: what does it do?
[03:43:08] <air_> whatever_42: maybe you could make it a bit more readable by using variables, and then add some console logging to see what happens.
[03:43:41] <StephenS> no this is different code
[03:43:51] <air_> and wouldn't it be better to bind the click event to '.sidebar_element' instead of document.
[03:43:58] <StephenS> I have that checking and using some part of php for language message showing, and its inside js code
[03:44:03] <StephenS> how to iclude such a js?
[03:44:03] <whatever_42> MickRip_: itz fires an ajax request when you click on an li element
[03:44:21] <whatever_42> MickRip_: afterwards it updates certain divs with the answers
[03:44:32] <MickRip_> whatever_42: are there <li> inside <div class="sidebar_element">
[03:44:33] <whatever_42> air_: could you give me an example
[03:44:47] <air_> whatever_42: you know you can debug mobilesafari on mac, right?
[03:45:07] <whatever_42> MickRip_: nope <li class="sidebar_element"></li>
[03:45:19] <whatever_42> air_: no i did not know hta
[03:45:20] <air_> whatever_42: http://moduscreate.com/enable-remote-web-inspector-in-ios-6/
[03:45:21] <whatever_42> that*
[03:45:44] <MickRip_> whatever_42: just a thing, I think the _element is a bit superfluous. it's not exactly anything else :P .. ie. !=sidebar_potato
[03:46:20] <MickRip_> whatever_42: what does it do wrong?
[03:48:15] <whatever_42> well this code does not work at all on my ipad anymore
[03:48:56] <whatever_42> nothing happens so i suppose it isn't even triggered
[03:51:36] <MickRip_> whatever_42: firstly, clean up your selector a bit .. um ..
[03:52:21] <MickRip_> whatever_42: $(document).on("click", '.sidebar_element', function(e){ <----   $(".sidebarelement > li").click(function(e) .. etc?
[03:54:27] <whatever_42> i will get started on the first one. what do you mean with your second statement
[03:54:44] <air_> hey, whatever_42, why don't you put a simple example in jsfiddle?
[03:54:56] <MickRip_> whatever_42: actually, sorry, I meant to suggest you change your markup to <ul class="sidebar"  ..   (woops)
[03:59:21] <whatever_42> so this is basically the code. of course the ajax part does not work. http://jsfiddle.net/GLeT4/2/
[03:59:43] <air_> now that's a lot better starting point.
[04:00:29] <MickRip_> whatever_42: do you know if the event fires?
[04:00:57] <whatever_42> nope it does not. i added the alert line and it doesn't pop up on my ipad
[04:03:24] <MickRip_> whatever_42: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/4jPKb/
[04:03:55] <whatever_42> won't work. the sidebar is loaded via ajax
[04:04:00] <whatever_42> so i need the .on functio
[04:04:01] <whatever_42> n
[04:04:28] <StephenS> Why does this give me syntax error http://jsfiddle.net/TYvLL/
[04:04:45] <StephenS> That output echo is from php files, Im trying to make global vars for js files.
[04:05:03] <air_> StephenS: wrap your strings in "
[04:05:25] <air_> http://jsfiddle.net/TYvLL/1/
[04:05:39] <StephenS> oh lol thanks
[04:07:48] <MickRip_> whatever_42: .. what about with $("#sidebar-container ul > li").on("click", function(e){ ?
[04:08:07] <MickRip_> whatever_42: http://jsfiddle.net/4jPKb/1/
[04:09:39] <air_> why not just use: $("#sidebar-container").on("click", "li", function(e){
[04:09:56] <air_> there's not like youre gonna have an li without on ul.
[04:09:57] <MickRip_> air_: +1
[04:11:19] <air_> gotta run, kids are crying and wife says it's time to go shopping.
[04:11:29] <air_> not that much you can do then :P
[04:11:30] <air_> afk.
[04:11:50] <whatever_42> where did you guys get #sidebar-container from?
[04:12:39] <MickRip_> whatever_42: oh I renamed it .. it's just the parent of the UL
[04:12:55] <whatever_42> i was just a bit confused
[04:13:17] <whatever_42> $("#actualSidebar").on("click", 'li', function(e){
[04:13:19] <whatever_42> does work
[04:13:37] <MickRip_> I'm really anal with var names. Like "actual" ... actual? :P ..
[04:14:29] <MickRip_> whatever_42: maybe mobile safari is a bit finicky with $(document), no idea!
[04:14:31] <whatever_42> yeah maybe someday i will find better names for my div
[04:16:05] <whatever_42> is there some sort of guide how i should name things?
[04:18:41] <MickRip_> whatever_42: nope, but I like the Lisp way (what Bootstrap uses). ie. sidebar-container (etc) .. I use the work container to identify a collective. It's just gotta be scemantically succinct.. I mean, everything is 'actual' on your page. everything is an element on your page. no need to call it an element.
[04:18:57] <MickRip_> *work = word
[04:20:19] <MickRip_> so lowerCamelCase for javascript ... whatever_this_is for PHP .. and Lisp for CSS
[04:28:14] <lxsameer> hi, prop("disabled", true) did not work on FF is it ok ?

Did I make myself clear?

[05:45:00] <constantin_mike> is there any way to make it to re-load the content each time i open it?
[05:47:04] <constantin_mike> any idea?

[06:57:05] <sonotos> hi is there a native way in jquery to do something like: $('#id').height('+=200px');?

[07:24:18] <Che-Anarc> How to re-move something after $("#btnClose").animate(...) ?
[07:25:16] <ravenzz> ?animate @ Che-Anarc
[07:26:08] <ravenzz> Che-Anarc you can provide a function to call when the animation is complete
[07:26:17] <ravenzz> (as last parameter)
[07:26:22] <Che-Anarc> Oh right thanks.
[07:28:03] <ravenzz> Che-Anarc anyway whenever you have a doubt or question you should take a look at the documentation, usually it is a good way to learn more about a function/feature

[07:31:13] <MadPig> I have looked on the jQuery and jQueryUI sites for hours now. I give up.
[07:31:36] <MadPig> This "<span role="status" aria-live="polite" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">No search results.</span>" thing keeps popping up. How do I control/remove it?
[07:32:50] <EugeNeo> Hi
[07:32:58] <MadPig> Anyone alive?
[07:33:06] <EugeNeo> Hello MadPig
[07:33:48] <topriddy> how can I set the value of a select option to its default save using jquery after the page is done loading?
[07:33:51] <EugeNeo> Can you read me ?
[07:34:26] <topriddy> problem with the jquery approach is that users actually see the select box changing...i'll rather it just shows with the default already selected
[07:41:13] <Che-Anarc> Can function / method argument's contain defaults like function something(x = 1, y = 2) ?
[07:46:15] <MadPig> I have looked on the jQuery and jQueryUI sites for hours now. I give up. This "<span role="status" aria-live="polite" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">No search results.</span>" thing keeps popping up. How do I control/remove it?
[07:47:30] <yogurt_truck> Che-Anarc: nope. you'll have to implement your defaults logic manually by doing things like var width = opts.width !== undefined ? opts.width : 250. Or, use jQuery's .extend function() (create an options object with the defaults, and .extend() it with the user opts, to override them)
[07:57:39] <MadPig> I have looked on the jQuery and jQueryUI sites for hours now. I give up. This "<span role="status" aria-live="polite" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">No search results.</span>" thing keeps popping up. How do I control/remove it?
[08:05:21] <topriddy> i wrote this in the body of my document ready function but cant find it when i view web source in browser. is this normal? var selectedOption = '<c:out value="${portletState.generalFilterOptionVuo}"/>';
[08:06:57] <topriddy> problem with the jquery approach is that users actually see the select box changing...i'll rather it just shows with the default already selected

[09:52:18] <bsetterb> Hi all - this is the first time in this chat room for me.  Are there any rules or etiquette tips (no flames for the noob pls)
[10:10:45] <Zjukov> Is it possible to customize a jquery line chart to use text values in the y-axis (that behind the scenes maps to different values for each series)?
[10:10:58] <Zjukov> For example I would like to have y-values like: Bad, Fair, Good
[10:11:18] <Zjukov> and series such as: Wealth and Health
[10:11:22] <Zjukov> just to give an example
[10:11:36] <Zjukov> and the Wealth Good-value would be 1000
[10:11:42] <Zjukov> while the health good value would be 50
[10:11:46] <Zjukov> Again, for example
[10:11:53] <air_> bsetterb: AFAIK there are no clear rules here, but to get help, it's the basics that are used for irc. Ask directly instead of asking to ask. Try to be clear, use pastebin / jsfiddle for code instead of here, etc.
[10:12:12] <andrew9184> ?ask bsetterb
[10:12:15] <bot-t> andrew9184, Couldn't find "ask bsetterb" in jQuery Docs.
[10:12:28] <Zjukov> I'll go grab some food, grateful for any comment, thanks! :-)
[10:12:52] <air_> bsetterb: and lastly, people do in fact idle here a lot, so if you don't get answers directly, it's just normal.
[10:13:12] <andrew9184> ?ask
[10:13:12] <b-ot> andrew9184: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[10:22:01] <StephenS> why does $.get does not work/start inside modal/when modal opened?
[10:22:04] <StephenS> do I need trigger?
[10:22:50] <Ukto> can anyone tell me how I can use .table-striped tbody tr:nth-child(odd) td, (alternating table row bg colors) with the jquery .highlight function? it seems to stop the effect.
[10:24:54] <TonkaTruck> Hey y'all.  I'm developing a third party widget and trying to keep things as organized and light as possible.  Very nice to revisit jQuery plugin dev.  Anyway, I'm in search of some advice for a light-weight template library.  Everything is going to be concat/uglified by grunt.  Is pre-compiled mustache the best option?
[10:26:19] <TonkaTruck> Also, am I right in assuming that all pre-compiled templates leave the template library out of the picture anyway?  A compiled template is just js, right?
[10:36:41] <defaultro> hey guys, is it possible to retrieve value from php without using ajax?
[10:38:21] <Logikos> output the value with the page?
[10:38:30] <defaultro> they are separate files
[10:38:53] <Logikos> php can read the other file, you can output any data javascript needs with the page
[10:39:15] <Logikos> you only need ajax if you want the page to dynamicly request data from the server
[10:39:24] <Logikos> but you can send as much data as you want in the original document
[10:39:36] <defaultro> i'm trying to understand your last 2nd sentence
[10:40:14] <defaultro> here is what is happening. PHP is pulling a hashcode from an external site using curl library
[10:40:30] <Logikos> supose in php you did echo '<script>somevar = { jsonobject:"whatever" };</script>';
[10:40:38] <Logikos> php builds and outputs the page
[10:40:40] <defaultro> this hashcode string, an 8 character code is required by js
[10:40:47] <Logikos> so you can contain as much data in the original output as you want
[10:40:51] <defaultro> yes, I'm familiar with that
[10:40:52] <Logikos> it just increases load time for the user
[10:41:27] <defaultro> but how can I pull that value from php if my officemate is telling me not to use ajax
[10:41:57] <defaultro> he said, i'm adding a load to the frontend
[10:43:02] <defaultro> i still don't understand how the frontend will not make any calls
[10:43:08] <Logikos> if one js file needs a code from php, and you dont want to use ajax, why not just put the code into the js file
[10:43:23] <defaultro> exactly the code I have and the one he turned down
[10:43:25] <Logikos> did you write the javascript file your refering to?
[10:43:38] <defaultro> know but I have access to it
[10:43:47] <TonkaTruck> Is it possible that your officemate doesn't know how the internet works?  Sometimes that happens.
[10:43:49] <Logikos> keep in mind i only saw and answered the question in your last post before i spoke, i have no clue about the larger picture your trying to do
[10:43:55] <defaultro> and I looked at the firebug and it's only taking like 187ms
[10:44:12] <Logikos> TonkaTruck++
[10:44:19] <defaultro> the hashcode is added to an url, like this,
[10:44:45] <Logikos> javascript can read the url ? just get it from there ?
[10:44:46] <defaultro> "http://www.some.com/info/'+hashcode+'/some/path/dynamic/images
[10:45:04] <defaultro> yes Logikos that's the code I currently have in QA and it's working great
[10:45:11] <defaultro> unfortunately, he doesn't like it
[10:45:20] <Logikos> who is he
[10:45:25] <sacho> You're not explaining the situation well.
[10:45:28] <Logikos> and why does it mater what he likes
[10:45:45] <defaultro> i couldn't even see any difference when hashcode is hardcoded versus dynamic pulling of hashcode
[10:45:51] <Logikos> if javascript needs a code, you have to figure out how javascript can access that code
[10:46:08] <Logikos> it can get it from the document, from the url, or from another file via ajax
[10:46:33] <Logikos> and we dont know what you even need the code for or are useing it for
[10:46:36] <defaultro> the main reason why he doesn't like pulling the hashcode inside js is that it is actually pulled by user browser which is true
[10:46:42] <Logikos> you asked how to get the code
[10:46:45] <Logikos> pick one of the 3 options
[10:46:50] <defaultro> k
[10:46:52] <sacho> defaultro, you're not making sense.
[10:46:57] <defaultro> sacho, in what way
[10:47:09] <sacho> the main reason why he doesn't like pulling the hashcode inside js is that it is actually pulled by user browser which is true <-- this doesn't make sense.
[10:47:33] <Logikos> i think (not sure) he is trying to sugest that the code is different per user ?
[10:47:36] <defaultro> it makes the frontend slower, that's what he meant
[10:47:37] <sacho> pretty much any data the server sends to the browser is made available to your javascript code.
[10:47:37] <Logikos> even though thats not what he said
[10:47:44] <TonkaTruck> and you can't put it in the php output?
[10:48:11] <TonkaTruck> by parsing the server var for the request uri?
[10:48:24] <Logikos> if its a unique code for each user i assume php is storing it in a session var, so output that session var value with the document
[10:48:34] <defaultro> i can put it in the php code but he doesn't want me to use ajax to call the php
[10:49:05] <defaultro> session var will only be available to PHP and not javascript file. I might be wrong though
[10:49:12] <TonkaTruck> ack.  You can just spit out js in your php output then.
[10:49:21] <TonkaTruck> I don't think either of you know how the internet works hehâ€¦ ;)
[10:49:29] <defaultro> I know how internet works
[10:49:30] <TonkaTruck> I mean you and your expert office mate.
[10:50:19] <defaultro> by the way, the js file is about 4500-5000 lines long
[10:50:21] <Logikos> *sigh*
[10:50:36] <defaultro> but I'm only adding one change which is the pulling of code
[10:50:42] <Logikos> defaultro, TonkaTruck is not misleading you, stop talking and listen more
[10:50:53] <Logikos> bbl
[10:51:09] <defaultro> ok
[10:51:13] <TonkaTruck> Holy cow that is a huge file.
[10:51:15] <sacho> I don't think we can really help you further unless you manage to produce a more meaningful description of your problem
[10:51:37] <defaultro> i'll start and will do my best to explain
[10:52:00] <defaultro> I'm writing it now
[10:53:10] <TonkaTruck> defaultro: in your php, $_SERVER[''PATH_INFO''] will have the uri with your code in it.  Now, parse that for the code using regex or whateverâ€¦and then echo javascript with that code in your php output.  It is here that your js will access the code.
[10:53:31] <defaultro> 1) the existing .js file contains different function. One function is pulling map tiles like google tiles, leaflet, etc. However, our maptile url hash a hashcode. This hashcode can change in a week or just within a day.
[10:53:52] <defaultro> reading your post TonkaTruck
[10:54:30] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone know how I can tell Chrome/Mozilla to use a different time for javascript? I'm trying to debug some timezone-related stuff (server/user sync)... Moreover, I cannot change the system time since that's where the server runs :/ ... Thanks in advance! :-)
[10:56:30] <JD-Robbs> Ahh I'm stupid...
[10:56:33] <defaultro> TonkaTruck, I'm a little confuse. If you saw my post just few minutes ago, the js pulls the map tiles(jpg or png images of a city, state, or street). The map tile url is inside this js script. This url uses a hashcode. However, the hashcode can change in a week or two
[10:56:37] <JD-Robbs> I changed the system time not timezone
[10:57:35] <defaultro> TonkaTruck, so I added few lines of code using ajax to contact the external REST service that provides the hashcode
[10:57:49] <shoky> defaultro: why don't you listen?  just output this hashcode as a javascript variable into the ORIGINAL page. that way it's already there, you don't need to retrieve it from anywhere
[10:58:11] <defaultro> will try to read your post shoky
[10:59:11] <shoky> just like Logikos told you:   <Logikos> supose in php you did echo '<script>somevar = { jsonobject:"whatever" };</script>';
[10:59:49] <defaultro> There is no issue with displaying the hashcode within the same js code. It's wokring. The problem is that the other developer doesn't want me to pull the hashcode using ajax
[10:59:55] <shoky> DONT
[11:00:00] <shoky> you are not listening at all.
[11:00:06] <defaultro> i'm trying my best
[11:00:16] <shoky> didn't my sentence end with "you don't need to retrieve it from anywhere" ?!
[11:00:27] <defaultro> k
[11:00:40] <defaultro> so in php, I will have <script>somevar = { jsonobject:"whatever" };</script>
[11:00:50] <shoky> if the original page has:   somevar = "ABCDHASHCODE";
[11:00:52] <defaultro> then
[11:00:59] <shoky> then all you need to do to have the hashcode in javascript
[11:01:03] <shoky> is ACCESS THAT VARIABLE
[11:01:07] <shoky> by WRITING ITS NAME
[11:01:11] <shoky> no ajax.
[11:01:21] <TonkaTruck> hahahahah writing its name
[11:01:22] <TonkaTruck> best
[11:01:43] <defaultro> :) I will try reading it again because looks like it's wrong
[11:01:55] <shoky> try reading it while thinking it's right
[11:02:09] <TonkaTruck> I don't think his problem is even getting the var.  I think it's actually changing all the urls that are hardcoded in his giant js.
[11:02:18] <defaultro> js file is map-control.js and the php file doesn't exist yet. Let's call it, pullhashcode.php
[11:02:25] <shoky> no
[11:02:30] <defaultro> TonkaTruck, you are correct
[11:02:32] <shoky> what is the original page that includes the .js?
[11:02:48] <defaultro> the huge .js file has the url to pull the maptiles
[11:02:59] <shoky> look again at my question
[11:03:01] <shoky> .js is not a page
[11:03:13] <defaultro> no, It is a javascript file
[11:03:27] <defaultro> the extension is .js
[11:03:28] <TonkaTruck> defaultro: Everywhere you have a url in your javascript you need to replace with myhugeapp.fileUrl('thecodethisweek')
[11:03:31] <shoky> ok, i didn't ask about a .js file. i asked about the page that includes the .js file..
[11:03:54] <defaultro> ah, I think that file is mainlayout.php
[11:04:05] <shoky> then that's the php we're talking about
[11:04:09] <defaultro> ok
[11:04:12] <defaultro> what's next
[11:04:19] <shoky> re-read everything everyone told you
[11:04:25] <shoky> knowing that they're talking about mainlayout.php
[11:04:28] <defaultro> k
[11:04:39] <defaultro> that means, I don't even need to create a new php file
[11:04:55] <shoky> good :)
[11:04:56] <defaultro> TonkaTruck, i didn't understand that code
[11:05:15] <TonkaTruck> myhugeapp.fileUrl('the code') will return a correct url?
[11:05:29] <TonkaTruck> I mean you have to write that method...
[11:05:33] <defaultro> k
[11:05:35] <TonkaTruck> I give up, sorry.
[11:05:46] <defaultro> I'll read up the post above again, one sec
[11:05:47] <Logikos> if you dont even know what php file is outputing the document how can you do anything?
[11:05:49] <TonkaTruck> Show me the website and I can tell you in 10 sesconds.
[11:06:52] <defaultro> fyi, <shoky> if the original page has:   somevar = "ABCDHASHCODE"; there is no hardcoding of hashcode in the mainlayout.php
[11:07:24] <defaultro> I'm still reading everything
[11:07:25] <defaultro> :)
[11:08:49] <shoky> how is that not hardcoding ?
[11:09:18] <defaultro> the hashcode is manually hardcoded as part of the url that is in a variable in map-control.js file
[11:10:13] <defaultro> $mapTileUrl = 'http://some.external.com/maptile/v2/abcef123/dynamicimage';
[11:10:17] <defaultro> something like that
[11:10:39] <shoky> <defaultro> the hashcode is added to an url, like this,   <defaultro> "http://www.some.com/info/'+hashcode+'/some/path/dynamic/images
[11:11:05] <defaultro> yes, the new code I have inside the map-control.js which uses ajax to contact a REST service that provides the hashcode
[11:11:14] <shoky> ok, and we're telling you
[11:11:23] <shoky> keep that like you did:   <defaultro> "http://www.some.com/info/'+hashcode+'/some/path/dynamic/images
[11:11:27] <defaultro> k
[11:11:36] <shoky> but hardcode  var hashcode = 'ABCDHASHCODE';  at the beginning
[11:11:43] <shoky> or whatever you want to call it
[11:11:49] <defaultro> k
[11:12:05] <shoky> then your new .js code will just use that hashcode, instead of retrieving it with ajax
[11:12:20] <shoky> objections?
[11:12:26] <defaultro> that code would be inside the php right?
[11:12:32] <shoky> where else?
[11:12:39] <defaultro> cool
[11:12:51] <defaultro> I was just worried that my map-control.js will not see it
[11:13:07] <shoky> why didn't you say so
[11:13:07] <defaultro> i'll try it
[11:13:57] <shoky> you can "play it safe" and even do:  window.hashcode = 'abcd';
[11:14:13] <shoky> if you don't wanna worry bout it ;p
[11:14:33] <defaultro> cool
[11:15:33] <shoky> let us know what your co-worker thinks about that :\
[11:15:40] <defaultro> will do :D
[11:16:01] <defaultro> he even suggested memcache and I would bash on him on that since it would require sockets
[11:16:24] <shoky> he did not mean for you to use jsmemcached like you suggested yesterday :\
[11:16:30] <shoky> at least i hope not.
[11:16:58] <defaultro> we'll find out on monday. I won't say anything yet
[11:17:10] <shoky> he meant use memcached to store the hashcode your php retrieves from the REST API,
[11:17:16] <defaultro> thanks for your help and TonkaTruck , learn  new things everyday :D
[11:17:27] <shoky> so that you don't need to retrieve it again, or something like that. i.e. cache it
[11:17:27] <defaultro> could be
[11:17:37] <shoky> but only access memcached from the php.
[11:17:42] <defaultro> k
[11:18:50] <TonkaTruck> defaultro: Good.  I wasn't trying to be too crass.  I think there's a language barrier?
[11:19:10] <defaultro> yup, english isn't my native language
[11:19:35] <defaultro> and still me not being too familiar with javascript
[11:20:58] <keebler> http://sabnzbd.org/
[11:21:34] <defaultro> BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It worked! :D
[11:21:43] <defaultro> woohoo
[11:22:34] <defaultro> I'll be able to go out now and bring down all the christmas lights. Nice weather out there, hehehe
[11:33:58] <MadPig> This "<span role="status" aria-live="polite" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">No search results.</span>" thing keeps popping up when I am using jQueryUI with the autocomplete thing. How do I control/remove it?
[11:34:09] <MadPig> I have serched forever in the documentation without finding anything.
[11:34:15] <MadPig> *searched
[11:35:02] <shoky> why do you want to control/remove it?
[11:37:26] <MadPig> shoky: Because I have no interest in it showing up.
[11:37:42] <MadPig> It has zero relevance.
[11:37:42] <shoky> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13011127/how-to-remove-change-jquery-ui-autocomplete-helper-text
[11:37:57] <MadPig> Plus, it uses English text AND bad grammar.
[11:38:03] <MadPig> So even if I wanted it, I couldn't use it.
[11:40:33] <MadPig> shoky: Thanks for that. It helped me solve it.
[11:40:41] <MadPig> But I still hate that it exists to begin with.
[11:42:15] <shoky> yea there should be an option for it
[11:44:15] <shoky> tho i'm clueless as to ui's accessibility policies
[11:45:29] <wdkevintwo> Can anyone recommend a good form validation plugin that works by just adding classes to the input field?
[11:46:16] <shoky> ?g jquery validation
[11:46:17] <b-ot> shoky: bassistance.de Â» jQuery plugin: Validation â†’ http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[11:46:19] <bot-t> shoky, bassistance.de » jQuery plugin: Validation - http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[11:47:06] <MadPig> shoky: Well, clearly there IS an option for it.
[11:47:10] <MadPig> But it's not documented.
[11:47:12] <MadPig> Or hidden.
[11:47:20] <wdkevintwo> i just used that jquery plugin
[11:47:29] <wdkevintwo> it doesnt work by assigning classes though
[11:47:32] <wdkevintwo> or not from what ican see
[11:49:23] <shoky> wdkevintwo: from their first example... <input id="cemail" name="email" size="25"  class="required email" />
[11:49:25] <MadPig> wdkevintwo: Are you talking to me?
[11:49:52] <wdkevintwo> shoky, seriously? i just looked at it and did not see that
[11:49:58] <wdkevintwo> everything was defined in the script tags
[11:50:18] <shoky> wdkevintwo: i mean the first demo in the documentation
[11:50:24] <wdkevintwo> ohhhh
[11:50:32] <wdkevintwo> then ill try it again
[11:54:00] <xhoy> i have a rails app, with jquery in it, i deploy my rails app in a subdir. the primairy assets are fine , but jquery likes to get them from the default location (/assets/) in sted of the subdir version (/foo/bar/assets/) any suggestions?
[11:54:49] <shibby> Hey, quick question... I am using $("<i></i>").appendTo(".ext"); to add an icon to external links, but new links that get added with ajax doesn't. Do i have to put that script in the ajax success call or is it possible to do with .on() ?
[12:03:23] <s34n> I have a function that causes two problems >> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5228993
[12:03:55] <s34n> the first problem is that firefox tells me there is too much recursion
[12:04:53] <s34n> the second problem is that I can't debug it with firebug because it makes firebug think there is "No Javascript on this page"
[12:07:44] <s34n> the recursion happens with I invoke the post on line 6
[12:07:57] <s34n> the recursion error, that is
[12:17:04] <_biff> hi all
[12:17:16] <_biff> i have a simple question
[12:17:45] <s34n> _biff: ask
[12:18:15] <_biff> how can i do setting a value to a inputbox after a data arrived by the query
[12:18:18] <troop> hello
[12:18:28] <_biff> so i want simple set a .val(value)
[12:18:46] <_biff> i dont want to echo the whole inpubox field
[12:19:30] <s34n> _biff: please clarify your question
[12:19:51] <_biff> öm...normally we echoing the whole html tags right?
[12:20:17] <s34n> _biff: you want to make an ajax request, then set the value of an input control?
[12:20:23] <_biff> for example if we want to fill an inputbox we echo the whole html tag "<input..." etc
[12:20:33] <_biff> but i dont want to do this
[12:20:43] <_biff> i want to set only a value of the input
[12:21:13] <_biff> yes
[12:21:13] <s34n> _biff: no. you can set the value with .val() as you mentioned
[12:21:14] <_biff> s34n
[12:21:20] <_biff> but its not working...
[12:21:33] <s34n> _biff: paste code
[12:21:52] <tw2113> pastebin.com code
[12:21:53] <_biff> pastebin?
[12:22:01] <s34n> _biff: yes
[12:22:59] <troop> i wonder how we can control if mouse on item or not?
[12:23:08] <TonkaTruck> Do any js template libraries like mustache, els, etc allow you to strip away the parsing code?  If I'm compiling templates with grunt this code is now uselessâ€¦but makes up the bulk of these libs.
[12:24:19] <s34n> TonkaTruck: what parsing code?
[12:24:45] <TonkaTruck> s34n: For parsing the templates you write and converting them into plain js functions?
[12:24:53] <s34n> troop: as in hover()?
[12:25:17] <s34n> TonkaTruck: several template libraries can use pre-compiled templates
[12:25:39] <shibby> Hey, quick question... I am using $("<i></i>").appendTo(".ext"); to add an icon to external links, but new links that get added with ajax doesn't. Do i have to put that script in the ajax success call or is it possible to do with .on() or in any other way?
[12:25:41] <troop> s34n i think yes, because i want to do that someone come on the div there will occur a new div with slide in first div..
[12:25:49] <TonkaTruck> s34n: I know much.  But my question is do any of them allow you to now omit the "compiling" code?
[12:25:50] <s34n> TonkaTruck: see dust.js
[12:27:13] <s34n> troop: doesn't hover() meet your needs?
[12:27:50] <troop> sorry, i wasnt know this func. i'm looking now thanks s34n
[12:30:03] <s34n> shibby: you could put it in the success handler, or see live
[12:30:56] <troop> by the way, is there a website that coding without editor?
[12:31:12] <s34n> shibby: but the success handler makes the most sense to me
[12:31:46] <s34n> troop: please reword your question
[12:32:00] <troop> by the way, is there a website that coding without editor?
[12:32:12] <troop> i want to try myself
[12:32:13] <TonkaTruck> s34n: I randomly found Dust yesterday.  Thanks for making me read the whole page ;)
[12:32:26] <s34n> troop: please use different words to ask your question
[12:32:43] <TonkaTruck> s34n: Yeah, 25k min with compiler, 6k min with renderer alone.  So excite.
[12:33:10] <rebel_yell> Hello i have a quick question; i am trying to append something from another page to the current page but the problem is that it is grabbing the layout of the page as well
[12:33:12] <rebel_yell> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5229064
[12:33:15] <rebel_yell> here is my gist
[12:33:27] <rebel_yell> coud anyone please take a look at it and maybe give me some feedback
[12:34:17] <s34n> rebel_yell: what do you mean by "layout"?
[12:34:27] <rebel_yell> my apologies it is a rails term
[12:34:37] <rebel_yell> it is grabbing the whole page not just the listings
[12:34:51] <rebel_yell> as in the everything within the page
[12:34:59] <s34n> you mean it is scraping all the html? of course
[12:35:05] <rebel_yell> correct
[12:35:14] <rebel_yell> is there anyway to just pull the specific div
[12:36:06] <rebel_yell> So in pseudo go to page 2 and grab <div id=listings>  and append it to the current page
[12:36:33] <s34n> rebel_yell: in loadMore(): $(response).find("#myDiv")
[12:36:49] <s34n> rebel_yell: in loadMore(): $(response).find("#listings")
[12:37:41] <TonkaTruck> s34n: https://github.com/STAH/grunt-dustjs you made my dayâ€¦thanks again.
[12:38:00] <s34n> rebel_yell: so, $("#listings").append($(response).find("#listings"))
[12:38:17] <troop> s34n: i want to create this slide effect: http://psdhtml.pro/projects/Regina/glowna.html#  what is name of this kind animation?
[12:38:48] <troop> if you give me the name i will seek on google and wont bother all of you thanks :)
[12:39:51] <s34n> TonkaTruck: quick work
[12:40:39] <s34n> troop: which effect?
[12:41:05] <troop> http://psdhtml.pro/projects/Regina/glowna.html# here.... bring your pointer to thumbnails
[12:42:02] <s34n> troop: you mean growing the bottom box to display lorem ipsum?
[12:42:12] <troop> yes
[12:42:16] <troop> i mean it
[12:42:48] <s34n> there are lots of ways to do that
[12:43:09] <s34n> one is just to unhide the lorem ipsum box
[12:43:34] <s34n> depending on your styling, to would cause the container to grow that way
[12:43:48] <s34n> s/to/it/
[12:44:04] <troop> hmm
[12:44:15] <troop> thanks
[13:07:33] <Hilton> Hallo. Been playing with AJAX forms using as few examples as possible. Have come up with two ways to go about it, wondering if someone can give me thoughts...
[13:08:04] <Hilton> First way is to embed the form fields in the initial HTML, and have them show/hide when "Edit" buttons or equivalent are clicked.
[13:08:23] <Hilton> Second way is to use ajax to get the actual form fields as well.
[13:08:57] <sadtaco> Sure. Do it whichever way you want
[13:09:05] <sadtaco> Or dynamically make the html with javascript
[13:09:14] <jrockjiggz> Hilton: (dynamically) you can take the text inside the element, and hide() the text and append a form element with that said text
[13:09:43] <Hilton> Some of the form elements are quite complex, however (ie. massive SELECTs). It's not just inputs.
[13:09:49] <jrockjiggz> theres no need to create an ajax request just to manipulate the page, you dont need to retrieve any data
[13:10:36] <Hilton> So I'm probably best to go the first way, then. Embed all my fields in hidden divs, and swap visibility with the display div when editing is done (or pop it up in a lightbox).
[13:10:45] <jrockjiggz> thats ok, just keep your data as an array and build the list with a loop
[13:11:02] <jrockjiggz> yea, you can hide/show or build dynamically
[13:11:14] <jrockjiggz> show/hide will probably be a lot less js
[13:33:21] <troop> funny but real question: http://learn.jquery.com/ is that enough for learning ?
[13:34:35] <tw2113> i would assume it'd be a good resource
[13:34:40] <tw2113> given that it's from jquery.com
[13:34:47] <tw2113> but it's not going to be the end-all-be-all resource
[13:37:41] <jrockjiggz> troop: i watched some youtube videos, i didnt get it at first but keep on it, it will sink in.
[13:39:05] <troop> jrockjiggz tx
[14:10:36] <fission6> i want to select certain divs, then parse each div's content for the following string pattern 'something@mm/dd/yy' how can i do that
[14:21:47] <z3yo> is there a better way than :     $(".progress-slider").slider({
[14:21:48] <z3yo>         value: $( ".progress-input" ).val(), ?
[14:28:40] <StephenS> z3yo, yes
[14:28:53] <StephenS> $(this)
[14:29:06] <StephenS> If you are inside progress-slider, or selected before
[14:31:42] <z3yo> StephenS, see what I have : $(".progress-slider").slider({ value: $( ".progress-input" ).val(),
[14:31:57] <StephenS> and what do you want?
[14:32:13] <z3yo> I'm using the selector twice, is there a way to use this instead of my second selector
[14:33:58] <StephenS> You dont use selected twice
[14:34:37] <StephenS> You use two different class, and $(this) will only work if you are already inside the class
[14:35:11] <z3yo> Damn, that's right
[14:35:16] <z3yo> Hard day â€¦
[14:35:53] <z3yo> thx
[15:03:17] <kristofers> Why am i getting function is not defined, when using .ready
[15:04:05] <jrockjiggz> because jquery is not defined.. in console type typeof(jQuery)
[15:04:33] <kristofers> ReferenceError: mobileform is not defined
[15:04:41] <kristofers> if i remove jquery it works
[15:04:44] <kristofers> i mean .ready
[15:04:53] <jrockjiggz> ?ready
[15:04:53] <b-ot> jrockjiggz: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[15:05:02] <jrockjiggz> it is a core jQuery function
[15:05:43] <jrockjiggz> kristofers: do you have <form name="mobileform"> ?
[15:06:11] <kristofers> it's a function
[15:06:18] <jrockjiggz> o
[15:06:40] <kristofers> problem is if i use the function within jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[15:06:43] <kristofers> it gives me this error
[15:07:11] <tw2113> kristofers, are you using $ or jQuery for the reference?
[15:08:06] <kristofers> you mean when calling the function ?
[15:08:09] <jrockjiggz> i just use $( function(){ //jquery });
[15:09:36] <tw2113> just trying to make sure jQuery is actually loaded properly
[15:10:27] <kristofers> it is
[15:16:45] <Pixz> Hey there, i need your help :(
[15:16:55] <awilfox> Hello.  I'm trying to use the Datepicker from jQuery UI, and I'm having an odd issue: the date picker displays correctly, but clicking a date doesn't work in any of the browsers I tested (Safari 6, Chrome 25, Firefox 19).  I see this in Web Inspector in Safari: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating '= inst.currentDay = $("a", td).html()')
[15:17:50] <shoky> `demo @ awilfox
[15:17:50] <b-ot> awilfox: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:18:09] <awilfox> A simplified test case is here: http://temp.wilcox-tech.com/simpletest.html and I'm not sure what to do :/
[15:18:36] <awilfox> Sorry, I was waiting for afp to finish copying the file
[15:18:54] <awilfox> Click "Week" to show the input box that has the date picker
[15:19:10] <Foxhoundz> `ask @ Foxhoundz
[15:19:10] <b-ot> Foxhoundz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:19:18] <Pixz> My Jsfiddle doesnt want to run properly, so it's a bit hard to show you my problem, but it runs well in local :(
[15:19:18] <Foxhoundz> heh
[15:19:23] <Pixz> Here is the Jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/dGjDL/
[15:24:16] <Pixz> nobody ? ><
[15:24:57] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/dGjDL/2/
[15:24:59] <jrockjiggz> pixz
[15:25:11] <Pixz> Nice :(
[15:25:17] <Pixz> Thanks jrockjiggz
[15:28:24] <Pixz> So... It seems that there's no problem with it. But in local, the "forms" appear and then move from 1-3px to their definitive placement during the animation. Dont know why it doesnt show this with Jsfiddle :(
[15:28:42] <shoky> awilfox:  you have two elements with id="week"
[15:28:46] <shoky> awilfox: that's causing the issue
[15:30:05] <awilfox> oh wow.  I feel like a derp for not noticing that.  that did indeed fix it, thank you very much shaky :)
[15:30:23] <awilfox> err, shoky*
[15:30:26] <shoky> ;]
[15:32:10] <jrockjiggz> Pixz: i changed it to a stacked callback.. http://jsfiddle.net/dGjDL/3/
[15:40:55] <balr0g> hello, i need some <a> inline-block element to be toggled for enable and disable audio... why jQuery .toggle() sets display:none on it? tks for help
[15:43:55] <shoky> balr0g: that's what .toggle() does
[15:44:42] <balr0g> shoky: which way to always have the inline-block on element and just use the callbacks function to .play() and .stop() some <audio>?
[15:45:04] <tw2113> attach click handlers to them?
[15:45:44] <balr0g> tw2113: its just one <a>, i think toggle is the right logic for it, am i wrong?
[15:45:58] <tw2113> well, you're trying to do something when it's clicked, right?
[15:46:12] <balr0g> tw2113: yep...
[15:46:19] <tw2113> .click() sounds pretty logical to me
[15:46:29] <tw2113> or, .on('click') etc
[15:46:45] <balr0g> tw2113: but how to manage if it is even or odd click?
[15:46:57] <shoky> balr0g: the .toggle() you're talking about has been deprecated and removed in 1.9 . manage the clicks on your own
[15:47:21] <tw2113> inside the immediate callback, switch some variable to ever or odd
[15:47:24] <tw2113> and act based on that
[15:47:40] <balr0g> tw2113: ok, like some flag.. ok, will try it
[15:48:17] <tw2113> *squee* 8 days
[16:03:25] <shoky> GoT?
[16:08:19] <tw2113> yup
[16:08:29] <tw2113> shoky ^
[16:09:48] <shoky> *squee*
[16:13:11] <tw2113> i see you squeed like a girl too :D
[16:19:15] <greengriminal> attempting to get my application to use the combination of the jquery selectable and dialog. I have a fiddle to demonstrate what I am trying to achieve: Jsfiddle. In my application I have this partially working in my application however I am unable to highlight my <td> elements as shown from the imgur: http://i.imgur.com/VESE810.png
[16:19:41] <greengriminal> not a jquery expert but why would this be happening - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5229716
[16:19:56] <greengriminal> im sure this set up is correct
[16:20:40] <Changa> Hello, I am designing a navigation for a parallax scrolling web page, the navigation will not be refreshed to change the .selected link. I want the yellow background to move behind of the clicked link while the page scrolls to that page. Is this possible? Please point me in the right direction. Here is the page - > http://edizarca.com/karpaz/
[16:24:31] <Changa> anyone? :)
[16:26:40] <johnkpaul> Changa: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[16:26:56] <johnkpaul> when the hash changes, you can update the background as you need
[16:27:58] <greengriminal> I guess my set up is incorrect with regards to using the selectable?
[16:33:45] <Changa> thanks johnkpaul, looking into it
[16:43:30] <_biff> hi again
[16:43:59] <_biff> what event occured when a control load is ready
[16:44:09] <_biff> for example a combobox loaded
[16:44:31] <_biff> i think about some .ready event
[16:44:41] <_biff> like document.ready when the whole page loaded
[17:02:07] <myndzi> what is 'this' in a jquery event callback?
[17:02:36] <myndzi> ...nm, why do i always find answers after i ask questions? :P
[17:07:22] <tw2113> why does it matter, you got an answer somehow
[17:12:38] <craigrich> hmm a question on any jasmine / mocha testers out there: is there a preference to using 'should' or 'expect' assertions? any key differences?
[17:27:42] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/4yR8pha8 â€“ what's wrong with this piece here? throws this error: TypeError: b.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[17:34:09] <shoky> qom2: fadeToggle only accepts one callback
[17:34:18] <qom2> :(
[17:34:39] <qom2> so what's the best way around that? I wanna be able to toggle the overflow.
[17:35:14] <qom2> check overflow and set it accordingly I suppose
[17:35:19] <shoky> either use a boolean flag.. or check the current offset
[17:35:41] <shoky> er overflow
[17:36:01] <qom2> hehe, yeah
[17:36:02] <qom2> thanks
[17:37:29] <shoky> er
[17:37:44] <shoky> qom2: just use a class.. and .toggleClass
[18:30:54] <anew_> where is the list of all events available with .on() ?
[18:31:16] <r2c2> http://jsfiddle.net/r2c2/vBQqR/1/  <-- trying to get a form field to hide if the parent has a certain class, can't get it
[18:37:32] <r2c2> anyone alive
[18:38:06] <shoky> r2c2:  then why are you re-showing it right afterwards?
[18:38:50] <shoky> the modal dialog does not pause execution of javascript, if that's what you were thinking
[18:38:58] <r2c2> oh ok
[18:39:05] <r2c2> i updated -> http://jsfiddle.net/r2c2/vBQqR/2/
[18:39:16] <shoky> and it works
[18:39:28] <shoky> sort of ;p
[18:39:45] <r2c2> yep lol
[18:40:04] <r2c2> I'm not sure where I should reshow it
[18:40:21] <shoky> either when re-opening the dialog next time
[18:40:26] <shoky> or when it closes
[18:40:54] <shoky> or any other time that suits you
[18:41:12] <r2c2> time of my life
[18:41:30] <shoky> werd
[19:19:34] <Ebon__> When binding a .change() event to a number input, is there a way to know whether the number went up or down?
[19:21:07] <strathmeyer> I don't think so.  You'd have to save the previous value and then check it agains the new value.
[19:21:23] <Ebon__> Okay, thanks.
[19:27:23] <strathmeyer> Ebon__: see http://jsfiddle.net/strathmeyer/rnvnb/
[19:29:00] <omani_> I use $('a[href$="[% uri_base %]"]').parent().addClass('active'); to active an active class. with / it works. with any other URI not.
[19:29:19] <omani_> "uri_base" is a placeholder for the URI which I get from my server (backend)
[19:29:41] <omani_> I get $('a[href$="/faq"]').parent().addClass('active'); there for example
[19:29:57] <omani_> but <li> is still not <li class="active">
[19:30:02] <omani_> when I do it manually. it works.
[19:30:05] <omani_> how can this be?
[19:30:24] <someprimetime_> Post a fiddle
[19:30:35] <someprimetime_> What is parent() supposed to be?
[19:30:41] <someprimetime_> the <li>?
[19:31:06] <someprimetime_> try closest('li')?
[19:31:39] <RandalSchwartz> is that template toolkit?
[19:32:18] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236686?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[19:32:21] <omani_> RandalSchwartz: yes
[19:32:26] <RandalSchwartz> Cool
[19:32:27] <RandalSchwartz> Perl
[19:32:37] <omani_> yes perl dancer running in background
[19:32:48] <omani_> someprimetime_: parent is <li>
[19:33:05] <omani_> someprimetime_: and it works if I set the url matching manually to some URI.
[19:34:54] <omani_> I don't get this. what's the difference between writing down /pricing in source code. or get it with a parameter like [% uri_base %], when both are equal
[19:35:19] <omani_> plus, if [% uri_base %] is "/" (root URI), then it works like expected.
[19:35:23] <omani_> but not with any other URI
[19:39:47] <rainabba> If I had 625 elements on my page which I needed to bind a .click() function to, is there any special considerations for best performance such as using an anonymous function in the .click() call vs defining the function ahead of time or maybe coding onClick="" on the generated elements instead of using $(selector).click()?
[19:40:29] <rainabba> I want to make sure I don't hit on some obscure issue with jquery or js that is rarely seen due to the unusually large number of object I'm dealing with.
[19:46:36] <Andrew_R> rainabba: you need to look into event delegation
[19:46:54] <Andrew_R> don't bind 625 elements, you'll get poor performance
[19:47:32] <rainabba> Delegation to what? Can you give me any more search context for what you have in mind?
[19:47:50] <Andrew_R> I'll make you a fiddle
[19:50:18] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/zZ5Hf/
[19:51:01] <Andrew_R> one event bind, then you can determine which element was clicked from event.target
[19:52:10] <omani_> ok I'm one step further
[19:52:31] <omani_> it doesn't work, when I try to get a URI which has jquery things going on
[19:52:44] <omani_> so that document.ready won't work
[19:54:59] <Andrew_R> I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but the click event bubbles up, so instead of binding 625 click events, do 1 or a few at a higher level in the DOM
[19:55:46] <shoky> rainabba: easier like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/zZ5Hf/1/
[19:55:57] <rainabba> Checking out both posts. Ty.
[19:56:15] <Andrew_R> the other night someone on here had a similar question, they had done a click bind for 600+ elements and it took 3+ seconds to run the function
[19:56:25] <shoky> i think it was rainabba ;P
[19:56:42] <Andrew_R> oh
[19:57:38] <rainabba> Andrew_R: That was't me, but shoky did just use some of my code from the other night so maybe we were asking really similar things. I was learning .each() the other night.
[19:57:40] <RandalSchwartz> seems weird to make anything at all clickable on your screen
[19:57:48] <RandalSchwartz> that's not obvious to me as a user
[19:58:02] <RandalSchwartz> I ten to click only on buttons and visible links
[19:58:04] <RandalSchwartz> tend
[19:58:37] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: It's obvious to my users :) I'll show, one sec.
[19:59:08] <RandalSchwartz> so these are users not familiar with the *normal* web?
[19:59:17] <shoky> rainabba: and you can read about event delegation here- see ?on
[19:59:27] <rainabba> Have a preferred image sharing site?
[19:59:29] <shoky> `api .on
[19:59:30] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[19:59:38] <shoky> `api on
[19:59:38] <b-ot> shoky: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:00:10] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: "these users" are "my users" and have certain expectations which I'd like to think I address well.
[20:00:53] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't change my sentiment
[20:01:06] <RandalSchwartz> unless you have some extenuating circumstances
[20:01:29] <Andrew_R> RandalSchwartz: are you referring to setting the click event on the #container element?
[20:01:31] <rainabba> http://i48.tinypic.com/zmh4k8.png
[20:01:53] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: Are you bored? You're trying to argue a point without even knowing WHAT you're arguing.
[20:02:20] <rainabba> Look at that image and tell me you wouldn't know what to click if you had a test booklet in front of you :)
[20:02:34] <RandalSchwartz> so I see 5 x 24 clickable spots
[20:02:38] <RandalSchwartz> just the buttons
[20:03:06] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: Yep
[20:03:34] <rainabba> Glad we're in agreement :) Now to check out those code posts.
[20:04:05] <RandalSchwartz> but that's not a jquery event.  that's a real button click on an image
[20:04:21] <RandalSchwartz> in fact, until you hit submit, those are just radio buttons
[20:04:45] <RandalSchwartz> so you'd want a localized thing for each five buttons to act like a radio
[20:05:05] <RandalSchwartz> and then something on submit to read them all out
[20:06:07] <rainabba> shoky: on('click','a'....    is different under the hood from .click('a') ? Also, you disagree with binding at the container, the parsing through applicable children to check for what was clicked (as I understand it, what Andrew_R was suggesting)?
[20:06:19] <shoky> rainabba:  very different
[20:06:30] <shoky> rainabba: i told you, read about event delegation at http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:06:58] <Andrew_R> rainabba: now that I see what you're doing, maybe the button "Widget" from jQueryUI would be useful to you? http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio
[20:07:03] <shoky> rainabba:  using .on() like i did is equivalent to what Andrew_R was doing
[20:07:18] <shoky> he was doing it manually. .on() can do it for you
[20:07:27] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: Actually, they aren't radio buttons and there is no submit going on here. Each click will fire an AJAX call to a webservice.
[20:07:36] <Andrew_R> shoky is correct, I keep forgetting about the additional parameters that .on() can take
[20:07:39] <RandalSchwartz> that seems wasteful
[20:07:54] <RandalSchwartz> why do you care about the score until submit is pressed?
[20:08:01] <TonkaTruck> Is anyone here not using gruntjs?
[20:08:13] * RandalSchwartz is not
[20:08:16] <shoky> TonkaTruck: wat
[20:08:30] * RandalSchwartz raises hand
[20:08:32] <shoky> i am not using it at the moment either
[20:08:35] <shoky> :S
[20:08:43] <TonkaTruck> It is the most useful tool I've ever installed in my 14 years as a web dev.
[20:08:59] * RandalSchwartz googles it
[20:09:00] <shoky> who said everyone does node.js?
[20:09:05] <rainabba> shoky: "<shoky> rainabba:  very different" (under the hood), but " using .on() like i did is equivalent" (superficially)?  Going to read up about on() now.
[20:09:15] <TonkaTruck> shoky: I'm not using node.
[20:09:36] <RandalSchwartz> why use soemting with version < 1 ?
[20:09:45] <RandalSchwartz> if it's useful, version > 1
[20:09:52] <shoky> jquery uses it
[20:10:52] <omani_> ok now it works
[20:11:08] <omani_> I have to put jquery src (<script tag>) in every file
[20:11:11] <omani_> to load proper jquery
[20:11:16] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: You're worse than that damn bot in here. 1) Nobody said anything about caring about the score. 2) How would you like to spend 30 minutes taking a very difficult test, hit a submit button, then find out there's an issue? I have to do EVERYTHING I can within reason to mitigate "lost" events. Anyway, i'm not interested in arguing with you about an app for which you have NO requirements
[20:11:16] <rainabba> list for.
[20:11:17] <omani_> this is confusing
[20:11:28] <snover> i like strawberries
[20:11:33] <RandalSchwartz> "issue"?
[20:11:39] <RandalSchwartz> what kind of issue are you talkng about
[20:11:51] <RandalSchwartz> it's a frickin radio button page
[20:12:14] <RandalSchwartz> you choose 1 to 5 in each question
[20:12:26] <RandalSchwartz> imagine that *without* javascript, and you have your solution
[20:13:59] <Andrew_R> TonkaTruck: I had to look up gruntjs, at work we use the Web Essentials plugin for Visual Studio does a lot of what gruntjs would do, but I could see where it might be useful for other environments
[20:14:20] <Andrew_R> heg
[20:15:04] <rainabba> Andrew_R: About the button "Widget": I'm not using any form elements (all div and span styled with css). There any advantages you know of to using that widget in regards to my original question, or is it more for esthetics?
[20:16:27] <Andrew_R> I was thinking you could use regular radio buttons and style them the way you want to, instead of manually doing it with divs and spans.
[20:16:41] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[20:16:45] <rainabba> shoky and Andrew_R: Using on(), do you guys agree that I should target the container and parse the children to find the item clicked?
[20:17:05] <shoky> rainabba: i think you should do it like in my fiddle
[20:17:09] <RandalSchwartz> I don't.  just use radio buttons
[20:17:11] <shoky> (or the way RandalSchwartz suggest)
[20:17:11] <shoky> s
[20:17:29] <RandalSchwartz> don't reinvent the web
[20:17:46] <rainabba> Andrew_R: Gotcha. I went this route because there was major inconsistency in the way that radio buttons were handled with zooming (accessibility) and custom styling. This way I get full control and consistency.
[20:18:42] <Andrew_R> rainabba: I don't think your way is "bad" - probably not how I would do it though
[20:18:55] * RandalSchwartz wanders off
[20:19:18] <rainabba> shoky: Just to be clear, you're binding to each item individually and not worried if there got to be a significant number? Did RandalSchwartz actually contribute something? :)  I muted him so I missed it (unless I missed it earlier).
[20:19:27] <Andrew_R> you will run into problems though with 600+ events binded
[20:19:34] <shoky> rainabba: no i don't bind to each item individually
[20:19:44] <shoky> rainabba: have you read about .on() yet?
[20:19:53] <shoky> i do $('#container').on
[20:20:08] <Andrew_R> shoky's fiddle doesn't bind each element individually, it's the same as mine but shorter code
[20:20:38] <rainabba> shoky: Ahh, I see. misread your paste. I'm on board now and I'm reading about on still. There a point I should pay special attention to?
[20:21:06] <rainabba> Andrew_R: Ok. I see now.
[20:21:18] <shoky> rainabba: the part titled 'Event Delegation'
[20:21:22] <rainabba> RandalSchwartz: I've unmuted you now for what ever that's worth.
[20:21:24] <shoky> er or something like that
[20:21:26] <rainabba> rgr
[20:22:29] <Andrew_R> "Direct and delegated events" - the last couple paragraphs in that section especially
[20:23:53] <rainabba> shoky: Ok, so on('#container','a') is similar to .click('#container') then parsing to find the item clicked because it relies on bubbling up to the on() bound object?
[20:25:00] <rainabba> This fills in some gaps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8601482/jquery-on-vs-click-methods
[20:25:09] <rainabba> More context anyway
[20:25:45] <shoky> no that has nothing to do with it..
[20:25:46] <rainabba> Thanks once again gentlemen. Very helpful as always.
[20:26:22] <shoky> ah sorry, misread the SO post
[20:26:45] <rainabba> shoky: Not for my situation per-se, but from what I'm seeing .click() is a shortcut to on(sel, 'click') but without the advantages delegation can provide (which is useful in my case).
[20:27:21] <shoky> eh stop putting the selector as first argument
[20:27:46] <rainabba> Hmm, on() could actually make my life quite a bit easier now that I think about it because I'm willing to bet it provides a reference to the bound object AND the one that bubbled up (checking now).
[20:27:49] <rainabba> :)
[20:27:59] <shoky> .click(fn) is a shortcut for .on('click', fn)
[20:28:05] <rainabba> on('click', sel...
[20:28:19] <rainabba> noted
[20:28:28] <shoky> .click(fn) is NOT a shortcut for .on('click', selector, fn)
[20:28:45] <shoky> mostly because that makes no sense.
[20:29:09] <rainabba> "This method is a shortcut for .on('click', handler)" http://api.jquery.com/click/
[20:29:21] <shoky> that's what i said
[20:29:23] <shoky> handler===fn
[20:29:28] <rainabba> You're differentiating the selector bit?
[20:29:42] <shoky> yes, very much
[20:29:53] <rainabba> Ok, I took that as given. Understood.
[20:30:00] <shoky> it's the whole difference between direct and delegated events
[20:30:17] <rainabba> Right, that's my lesson for the night :)
[20:30:46] <rainabba> ...and why I will use on('click', '#container', .....)
[20:31:22] <shoky> *facepalm*
[20:31:22] <rainabba> No difference if I use an anonymous function in the on() call vs calling a previously declared function?
[20:31:36] <rainabba> LoL, now what?
[20:31:41] <shoky> no difference in that, no
[20:32:03] <shoky> does my fiddle do  on('click', '#container', .....)  ?
[20:32:33] * rainabba grins
[20:32:46] <rainabba> All about the delegates :P
[20:33:15] <rainabba> $('#container').on('click','.target', handler);
[20:33:38] <rainabba> Am I ok now?
[20:33:40] <shoky> `cc
[20:33:40] <b-ot> shoky: CASE CLOASED >:|
[20:33:55] <shoky> (yeah ;p)
[20:33:59] <rainabba> Ok. Thanks again.
[20:53:58] <omani_> I have a strange behaviour here
[20:54:22] <omani_> my jquery only works if I put it at the bottom right before the closing body tag
[20:54:29] <omani_> it doesn't work in head area
[20:54:33] <beachandbytes> example?
[20:54:35] <omani_> nor before opening body
[20:54:39] <omani_> or within body
[20:54:49] <omani_> beachandbytes: example?
[20:54:54] <beachandbytes> altho right before the closing body tag is a good spot
[20:54:58] <omani_> I have it in front of me
[20:55:06] <beachandbytes> do you have an example of it not working in the header you can post
[20:55:27] <omani_> beachandbytes: yeah, but then I can't use some code which gets loaded in the middle of the boddy
[20:55:30] <omani_> body
[20:57:06] <beachandbytes> how is the code loaded?
[20:57:09] <Andrew_R> omani_: are you forgetting to wrap your code in $(document).ready(function(){ //code }); or $(function(){ //code });   ?ready
[20:57:13] <rainabba> on() event object provides .currentTarget and .delegateTarget. That makes my life considerably easier :) Thanks again for the tip guys.
[20:58:26] <beachandbytes> what Andrew_R said! :)
[20:58:34] <omani_> Andrew_R: no I didn't forget to wrap into document.ready
[20:58:57] <omani_> beachandbytes: I use a webframework. which loads a main base layout. and all the single pages are loaded as templates
[20:59:11] <omani_> so the one main layout holds all jquery stuff I need
[20:59:23] <Andrew_R> URL?
[20:59:32] <omani_> Andrew_R: localhost
[20:59:34] <beachandbytes> how is the code in the body loaded?
[20:59:36] <beachandbytes> ajax?
[20:59:46] <omani_> template_toolkit
[20:59:51] <omani_> perl dancer framework
[21:00:20] <beachandbytes> im not familiar with perl dancer
[21:00:35] <beachandbytes> basically is the jquery code in the body hardcoded or loaded via a request?
[21:01:15] <omani_> seems  I figured it out
[21:01:19] <omani_> sec. nopasting
[21:01:45] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236709?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[21:01:51] <omani_> see the first line of jquery?
[21:02:05] <omani_> when I put it at the end of this stack, my code works
[21:02:39] <omani_> is there a relevance in the order or something like that?
[21:02:42] <omani_> while loading
[21:03:17] <beachandbytes> well they load in order if thats what you mean
[21:03:38] <omani_> but if jquery is the first line, my code does not work
[21:03:44] <omani_> maybe something gets overwritten
[21:04:14] <Andrew_R> but jquery is needed for your flot and pageslide plugins for sure
[21:04:25] <Andrew_R> I agree, maybe something being overwritten
[21:04:38] <Andrew_R> do you get any errors in the console on your page?
[21:05:27] <omani_> no
[21:06:20] <beachandbytes> maybe try making jquery the first and commenting out the other libraries one at a time
[21:06:20] <rainabba> beachandbytes: In the dev tools, put a break on the line where you're trying to execute and check for $. If it's not there, insert some <script> block after jquery but before your other libraries and step through checking for each. That way you should be able to figure out if one of them is killing off jquery and which.
[21:07:29] <Andrew_R> ?noConflict
[21:07:38] <Andrew_R> how do you make that thing work?
[21:07:56] <Andrew_R> ? noConflict
[21:08:12] <omani_> Andrew_R: me?
[21:08:16] <Andrew_R> yes
[21:08:17] <omani_> ah ok
[21:08:29] <omani_> when I put jquery as the last line
[21:08:30] <omani_> it works
[21:08:35] <Andrew_R> I was trying to send you a link to http://api.jquery.com/?s=noconflict
[21:08:40] <omani_> same as nopaste. only jquery not first line.
[21:08:45] <Andrew_R> sorry - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[21:09:42] <omani_> so I just put a noConflict there?
[21:09:54] <Andrew_R> I'd try it
[21:10:40] <omani_> like this? http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236721
[21:10:59] <Andrew_R> yeah, does that help?
[21:11:02] <omani_> no
[21:11:03] <omani_> :/
[21:11:46] <Andrew_R> um, that will remove $ and you have to use jQuery() instead
[21:13:33] <omani_> where should I put the script tags?
[21:13:38] <omani_> after head before body?
[21:14:07] <Andrew_R> no, they have to be either in the head or in the body, there is no inbetween
[21:14:13] <omani_> ok
[21:14:18] <omani_> and best practice is?
[21:14:40] <Andrew_R> libraries, in head, your code, right before </body>
[21:14:48] <omani_> I mean it shouldn't make any difference when I'm using document.ready right?
[21:18:00] <omani_> well
[21:18:08] <omani_> I'll continue tomorrow
[21:18:13] <omani_> good night. and thanks for help
[21:50:11] <relipse> anyone who uses git check it out : #git-workflow
[22:34:42] <tff> Hey, what are the methods I want to use to move an object and slightly reduce its size at the same time?
[22:35:10] <tff> Basically, I have a menu whose items are large boxes. I want to move the menu to the side, but vertically instead of horizontally.
[22:35:20] <tff> (That is, after an item is selected)
[22:35:58] <tff> So I just need to reduce every element and sub-element's size to some percentage, and move each to a predetermined absolute position.
[22:36:09] <tff> But all gradually within the timeout period.
[22:36:16] <tff> Does jquery have functions for this?
[22:38:51] <beachandbytes> sure
[22:39:36] <tff> The functions under the category 'Sliding' don't do it, so I'm sort of lost
[22:39:39] <tff> relatively new to jquery
[22:40:20] <beachandbytes> use jquery animate with the properties you want to animate
[22:40:23] <beachandbytes> width,height etc
[22:40:37] <tff> Ah, nice and general
[22:40:50] <beachandbytes> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[22:41:42] <tff> Thanks'
[22:41:48] <Hilton> If I'm trying to see what's being submitted in $.ajax() via POST in JSFiddle, what do I put in the url?
[22:42:47] <beachandbytes> what type of data are you submitting?
[22:43:06] <Hilton> Was trying to test something before I asked a question here ;)
[22:43:49] <Hilton> I've built a small associative array (built from input field data) and am trying to submit it via post.
[22:43:54] <beachandbytes> in general its /echo/datatype/
[22:44:03] <beachandbytes> where datatype = json,html,xml etc..
[22:44:14] <Error404NotFound> Hello
[22:44:59] <Error404NotFound> Could someone give me pointers on how i can extend buttonset() widget such that if ui-buttonset class is already set on the id given, it would just return without doing anything.
[22:45:23] <Hilton> I'm not sure how it's submitting?
[22:45:35] <Hilton> It's basic POST AFAIK.
[22:46:13] <beachandbytes> try /echo/html/
[22:48:25] <ner0x> Anyone familiar with the jQuery File Uploaders module and the less module tmpl it uses? I'm getting an odd error. https://gist.github.com/fswitalski/5230657 You can ignore most of the rails stuff, the html+js is there though.
[22:49:39] <Hilton> Okay here's my situation. http://jsfiddle.net/G4Quj/ - I'm trying to build a POST submission with the data from multiple input fields plus a hidden attribute. I've included sample HTML.  The method I came up with was to iterate the inputs and save the name attribute and value as an associative array. But $.ajax() won't submit it as far as I can tell.
[22:49:54] <Hilton> Lines 6-8 are of the most note, and line 16.
[22:50:15] <Hilton> Note at the moment line 16 was setup to find the right AJAX echo location, but I didn't find it.
[22:51:24] <beachandbytes> give me a sec my internet is redic slow
[22:53:26] <shoky> Hilton have you seen .serialize() and .serializeArray() ?
[22:53:36] <beachandbytes> just wrap the inputs in a <form id="yourform">
[22:53:36] <beachandbytes> then use
[22:53:40] <beachandbytes> $('#yourform').serialize();
[22:53:52] <Hilton> I'd have dozens of forms per page.
[22:54:34] <Hilton> I didn't think I'd need to serialize; this all worked just fine when I was submitting a single input with data: { userid: input.attr('userid'); field: input.attr('name'); value: input.val(); }
[22:54:46] <Hilton> Why can I not build an array that I can pass to data: instead of manually entering it?
[22:55:28] <shoky> serialize does that for you..
[22:56:33] <beachandbytes> what shoky said
[22:56:36] <shoky> Hilton: change post_data to an object {}
[22:59:29] <Hilton> Hmm... how do I do the variable field name? like:  post_data[$(this).attr('name')] = $(this).val();
[23:00:02] <shoky> yes. tho there's no reason to be doing that :\
[23:00:15] <lenswipee> hi, how to set focus on an input field, say <input>
[23:00:53] <shoky> .focus()
[23:03:54] <Hilton> .focus().select(); if you want to be nice to your users. ;)
[23:04:26] <lenswipee> what does the extra .select() do?
[23:05:17] <Hilton> Selects everything already in the field, so they don't have to manually delete it if they need to change it. If you're expecting a blank field, forget it.
[23:06:08] <lenswipee> Hilton: cheers
[23:07:38] <shoky> Hilton: you don't have to have any forms btw-  http://jsfiddle.net/G4Quj/2/
[23:08:52] <Hilton> shoky: It isn't intended to.
[23:09:04] <shoky> hm?
[23:10:50] <Forrestr> Hi, js/jquery noob here. How can I place my .ajax function in a var or custom function (add-element(); for example) so I can call it later in my else statement? http://pastebin.com/V7iNxPib
[23:11:50] <Hilton> Any difference or a this-is-better for returning status of AJAX calls --- use HTTP status codes and use error/success functions, or return HTML or "error" (the quick-fix used now) and use .done() ?
[23:12:42] <systemfault> Wellâ€¦ difference is relative, if you don't give a damn about doing things "properly" then just use done
[23:12:58] <systemfault> The "proper" way is to use HTTP properly..
[23:13:17] <Hilton> A lot of the jQuery.com examples use .done() so that's what I started with.
[23:13:41] <Hilton> But I realize it doesn't cover timeouts/404s/etc very well.
[23:13:42] <systemfault> If you set the HTTP status code to a 4xx or 5xx, .fail will be called as it should.
[23:14:02] <Hilton> eader
[23:14:19] <systemfault> With php, you would use header()
[23:15:12] <systemfault> Or http_response_code
[23:17:11] <lenswipee> Hilton: can you show a baredone example of ajax call with all the bells and whistles?
[23:17:33] <Hilton> lenswipee: Hey, I'm just working on that myself!
[23:17:50] <lenswipee> Hilton: Good man.
[23:21:55] <Hilton> What would be the proper HTTP response code to an AJAX submission that was not valid? Say, password fields that don't match or a malformed input (ie text where number expected) -- 400 Bad Request? 406 Not Acceptable? What is the "proper" code?
[23:22:54] <systemfault> 400
[23:23:06] <beachandbytes> or 401
[23:23:08] <systemfault> If the request is malformed.. 400 is what you want
[23:26:04] <Hilton> 401 specifies that the client must respond with an authentication header, that doesn't sound right. :P
