[00:10:07] <Betal> Velveeta: I found it, the second only works if you put it after #myinput
[00:10:35] <Velveeta> well.. yeah.. #myInput has to exist in order for you to bind to it
[00:10:47] <Velveeta> you should really be wrapping that in a document.ready function anyway
[00:12:20] <Betal> Velveeta: yeah, it works in a document.ready function
[00:15:40] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for the night, it's 2:15am here :)
[00:15:51] <Velveeta> be back on tomorrow at some point
[00:35:29] <Antera> hello
[00:36:43] <Antera> I just installed lazy load on a bootstrap ; it requires to specify the width and height of images ; it's ok when the columns have fixed width, however how to do when the columns go to width:100% ?
[01:23:23] <mouses> grammar question - if my site says:  The word "jquery" is not in the dictionary. Do i need a comma after "word"? As in: The word, "jquery" is not in the dictionary. ?
[01:30:25] <pixelpimp> no comma there
[01:31:08] <pixelpimp> if it were acceptable to write "the word (jquery)" in its stead, a comma would be useful
[01:32:14] <pixelpimp> they're called appositive commas if you want to find some good examples
[01:35:16] <kilian123> does anybody want to give me some feedback on a new responsive page?
[01:35:24] <kilian123> just layout question :)
[02:33:28] <benkaiser> Hey guys, I am having trouble writing a jquery command to trigger playing a song on google play music. I can trigger other things like play/pause and playlist selection but not on the <tr> of a song. Anyone use google play music that can help me debug?
[02:41:40] <dabear> benkaiser: think you gotta add a <div class="hover-button" data-id="play"></div> inside the first span, and then click that element
[02:42:55] <dabear> benkaiser: confirmed
[02:43:57] <dabear> benkaiser: add that element inside the first span in the tr, then click the new div, then remove that div again
[02:45:14] <dabear> and song starts playing :)
[02:46:08] <benkaiser> dabear, found it.... damn, you are a legend!!!! Hey if you have a stackoverflow account you could answer my question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19343698/start-track-with-id-in-google-play-musics-web-interface and I will mark it as correct. Thanks!
[02:46:45] <dabear> sure
[02:47:07] <benkaiser> I have to go, but thanks once again dabear!
[03:01:09] <kilian123> does anybody want to give me some feedback on a responsive layout?
[03:02:36] <kilian123> (or recommend another channel where i could ask?)
[03:16:05] <ravenzz> kilian123 a design feedback?
[03:24:55] <kilian123> ravenzz: yes
[03:25:03] <kilian123> for a responsive layout
[03:25:13] <ravenzz> you may want to ask #design then
[03:25:38] <kilian123> ok thanks!
[03:25:40] <kilian123> i'll try there
[03:36:45] <tigerlivie> Hi all, anyone about?
[03:37:02] <kilian123> just ask :)
[03:37:30] <tigerlivie> Me?
[03:39:25] <kilian123> jep
[03:39:55] <tigerlivie> righto! so, I have a general survey question
[03:40:13] <tigerlivie> I've made a very small (1 parallax page) website for a small business
[03:40:40] <tigerlivie> i'm not qualified (just finished high school), but i think my work's fairly good considering that fact
[03:40:56] <tigerlivie> i designed, developed, wrote the content and took the photos for it
[03:41:12] <kilian123> congrats :D
[03:41:24] <tigerlivie> I quoted it as $400, but they've said they could get a small business to do it for $250 in a week.
[03:41:38] <tigerlivie> am i shooting to high, or are they being honest?
[03:41:45] <tigerlivie> (painfully honest..)
[03:42:20] <kilian123> which page is it?
[03:42:28] <kilian123> i think, 400 should be ok...
[03:42:41] <kilian123> but there are people doing it for less money
[03:43:00] <kilian123> depends on the work
[03:43:03] <kilian123> and quality
[03:44:20] <tigerlivie> it's not live yet
[03:44:43] <tigerlivie> would you like me to host it for a minute?
[03:44:53] <kilian123> why not..
[03:49:01] <tigerlivie> (give me a minute, need to find the right info
[03:59:44] <tigerlivie> okay still there?
[03:59:53] <tigerlivie> here's the link (live for a limited time only!
[04:00:12] <tigerlivie> http://oliviakeegan.id.au/qandh/QueenAndHands-2013-10-13/QueenAndHands/index.html   @kilian123
[04:00:53] <tigerlivie> I realise it's not exactly the best site ever, and it's not entirely finished (they want a gallery that pulls from their facebook photos)
[04:01:10] <tigerlivie> (plus links don't work and the carousel isn't totall mobile responsive yet)
[04:04:00] <tigerlivie> in hindsight showing you the unfinished product probably isn't very helpful
[04:05:53] <kilian123> mom
[04:07:12] <kilian123> i think its not thad bad :)
[04:08:40] <tigerlivie> but not worth what i'm asking... is what i'm hearing
[04:09:02] <tigerlivie> what do you think i should be asking (and what are you qualifications, for that matter
[04:10:23] <kilian123> lol
[04:10:42] <kilian123> it depends on local prices as well...
[04:11:02] <kilian123> sell it for as much as you get
[04:11:36] <kilian123> people never say that its ok to pay what webmasters want to get
[04:12:34] <tigerlivie> :-/
[04:13:53] <sahbeewah> i like it
[04:14:46] <sahbeewah> 400 is fair, particularly in australia. demand it
[04:14:53] <sahbeewah> how long did it take you
[04:14:53] <sticky_> any way to make colorbox responsive? i'm using the last version
[04:16:16] <kilian123> sticky_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12182668/how-to-make-colorbox-responsive
[04:17:58] <sticky_> kilian123: what reply it's better? there are four code options
[04:19:04] <beegees> Hi
[04:25:23] <sticky_> kilian123: i am copying the first one, he says to Eventually, replace jQuery by $, i put $ in the code but i don´t see colorbox responsive
[04:26:55] <tigerlivie> sahbeewah: it's taken me about 25 hours in total I think, but clearly i've been learning along the way.
[04:27:07] <tigerlivie> what makes you say "particularly in australia"?
[04:30:38] <sahbeewah> labour is expensive in australia. and there's a shortage of technical people
[04:30:48] <sahbeewah> particularly competent, technical people
[04:31:58] <sticky_> im lost with the responsive colorbox issue. replace jQuery by $ means put $ only or is refering to put a class or something?
[04:33:15] <kpl> I have a click and a dblclick-handler in a table, and don't want the click handler to be called when I dblclick. How can I do that?
[04:33:29] <tigerlivie> i'm not sure i can be classed as competent yet. do you still think i can afford to ask that much?
[04:34:42] <kilian123> kpl: you could set times at each click and calculate the time between them
[04:35:18] <kilian123> tigerlivie: just try it
[04:35:25] <kilian123> or sell it somewhere else
[04:36:09] <tigerlivie> yeah okay, thanks for your help. it's nice to have some professional opinions
[04:37:04] <kilian123> it wont help you if they dont pay
[04:37:27] <tigerlivie> kpl: the way android does it is with a time interval like kilian said. it has a method that triggers when you click something, then it waits for a certain time to see if another one comes. if it doesn't, it performs the single click action. if a second tap happens in that time period, the double tap action fires
[04:37:41] <tigerlivie> yeah i know, i just don't really want to settle for less than 300
[04:37:45] <kpl> In documentready I have $("#maingroups_table tbody").on("click", "tr", function () {onmaingroupclick($(this));....    and the dblclick is set for each row by $('td:eq(0)').editable(  event: 'dblclick'
[04:37:49] <tigerlivie> and i get the feeling they're not going to budge
[04:39:15] <Leeffen> well, sell it, and next time you make something from an other firm, you have some code that will speed you up
[04:39:24] <Leeffen> rather get the money then none :)
[04:39:56] <kpl> "editable" is jquery.jeditable-1.7.1.mini.js, and the table is jquery.dataTables-1.9.4.min.js"
[04:40:00] <kilian123> kpl ask for the element type in the function
[04:40:31] <tigerlivie> Leeffen: I'm trying to avoid that option because i have an international holiday booked in december
[04:40:31] <sticky_> kilian i find how to. in js options max-height and max-width to "95%", it´s responsive but it not scale when you make bigger the browser window
[04:41:45] <kilian123> sticky_: what is that for?
[04:42:08] <kilian123> i dont know how to fix that sticky_
[04:42:36] <kpl> kilian123: sorry, could you elaborate a bit?
[04:42:49] <sticky_> is for when someone change the tablet from vertical to horizontal, to enlarge responsively the colorboxx
[04:43:11] <kilian123> sticky_: i'm just switchint between some channels and didnt get the connection
[04:43:29] <kilian123> set widhts to percent. but i dont know colorbox well
[04:44:03] <sticky_> ok
[04:44:08] <kilian123> so, im goin out now
[04:44:23] <kpl> One possibility could be to prevent the single click action if the row is already selected
[04:44:52] <kilian123> kpl: check single clicks and double clicks and check, which element was clicked
[04:44:56] <kilian123> in each function
[04:45:36] <kilian123> if someone clicks on the row once then check, if the element was a row... --> nothing happen
[04:45:48] <tigerlivie> thanks again guys
[04:46:03] <kilian123> on double click check, if it was a row and then do some action
[04:47:23] <kilian123> but im not sure if it makes sense to put an single clicke element as parent to a double click element
[04:47:39] <kilian123> or if ou could seperate them
[04:48:04] <kpl> kilian123: Not sure I understand how that would work. The user can click and double click in the same column. click will select the column and update another panel with info on the item clicked. double click is to edit the item text itself.
[04:48:33] <kilian123> single and double click event belong to the same element?
[04:48:51] <kpl> So I guess I could check at single click if the item is already selected, and then skip the handling.
[04:49:34] <Sherbert> I'm having animation issues with a toggle, maybe one of you has an idea? (http://jsfiddle.net/56A9Q/4/)
[04:49:40] <kpl> kilian123: To your last question: Let me check the details..
[04:49:44] <kilian123> or you could set an interval on single click and clear it on double click
[04:50:03] <kilian123> like .5 sec
[04:50:55] <kilian123> Sherbert: whats the problem?
[04:51:08] <Sherbert> it produces a jumpy animation
[04:51:19] <Sherbert> which starts off with the text too low, and then springs it back to a higher position
[04:52:06] <kpl> kilian123: single:  $("#maingroups_table tbody").on("click", "tr", function () {     double: $('td:eq(0)').editable(  event: 'dblclick'     So it seems single goes to tr, and double to td:eg(0)
[04:54:37] <kpl> So the user clicks and double clicks on the same element (column 0 in a table). But the single click handler is for the tr, and doubleclick handler for the column. The single click selects the row.
[04:54:45] <kilian123> kpl: onclick: set interval that fires .5 secs later to call the single-click-function
[04:55:04] <kilian123> check, if it was a double click. if yes, cancel the interval
[04:55:25] <kilian123> and call the dbl-click-function
[04:57:00] <kilian123> bye
[04:58:32] <relix> hey guys
[04:58:40] <relix> I'm using jquery promises, but my code is now full of promises boilerplate:
[04:58:40] <relix> http://pastebin.com/fkcZ0sUh
[04:58:44] <relix> is there a way to structure it better
[04:58:47] <relix> am I abusing promises?
[04:58:50] <relix> feel free to shout at me
[05:00:24] <Alohaha> Hello, I just started trying some JavaScript in a little test Web App I am developing, but i cant get the JavaScript to execute, this is what i have http://pastebin.com/CHEChckX and i want the div to animate while you mouse over it.
[05:00:55] <kpl> I have var color = col0.css("background-color");  How do I compare color to an rgb value?
[05:02:16] <Sherbert> Alohaha: you're using jQuery but there's no call to a jQuery library?
[05:03:36] <Alohaha> Sherbert: ok, Thx, how do I fix that I prob sound like a total noob but I dont have much experience witht his web app world ^^
[05:05:05] <Sherbert> You could download a jquery file and include it, or use Google's include, https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[05:05:39] <Alohaha> Sherbert, ill try that thx for the help i really appreciate it :)
[05:06:06] <Sherbert> No problem :)
[05:08:28] <kpl> How do I compare element.css("background-color") to a hex color value?   =="#FFFFFF" does not seem to work.
[05:15:34] <Alohaha> Sherbert: Got it working now! Thx again D:
[05:15:38] <Alohaha> *:D
[05:16:04] <rix_> hi there, noob question coming up - i see a lot of this type of construction (http://pastebin.com/FywaR1Ar) - how do i use these functions from inside document.ready?
[05:16:39] <rix_> so for instanc i have an object, and i want to call the function in the pastebin so i can get its inner and outer html.
[05:19:16] <Sherbert> Alohaha: Great!
[05:28:33] <_rgn> rix_: it extends jquery objects with that function
[05:28:56] <_rgn> so you could get an element with selector and call it like $('p').outerHTML()
[05:29:51] <rix_> right, got it.  did some googling and managed to find it.  seems so obvious now
[05:29:58] <rix_> that kicks ass though
[05:39:00] <rix_> thanks
[05:54:13] <Sherbert> I'm having animation issues with a visibility toggle, maybe one of you has an idea? (http://jsfiddle.net/56A9Q/4/) (It's not supposed to be jumpy)
[06:12:34] <VectorX> hi, can someone tell me how i can get the input/radio to get selected when the a accordian heading is pressed http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/
[07:12:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> good morning jquery!
[07:13:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: im assuming when the according is pressed a class is triggered correct?
[07:13:49] <VectorX> yes
[07:15:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so when you click an option why not toggle class
[07:15:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: why not just have an on click listener to the 'Foo?' div
[07:16:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> instead of finding the div
[07:16:48] <Sherbert> Rohan_Bhangui: It's because I have to deal with this exact layout (it's produced by a CMS). I can't use jquery's built-in accordion because it won't allow for collapse/show all
[07:17:01] <Sherbert> So I figured building something similar would be fine
[07:17:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: use toggleClass and remove sleected attr when switching to differnt lis
[07:17:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> *<li>s
[07:17:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: im not asking you to use jquery's built in accordion, i myself like things from scratch
[07:18:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me take a second look at code....i have a hunch it has to do with positioning
[07:19:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: you need it to slide up and down right?
[07:19:51] <Pnoexz> hey, anybody remember the function to select all children from an element?
[07:20:26] <Sherbert> Yea, just slide up/down. It's for FAQ items
[07:20:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pnoexz: function or method
[07:20:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay use slideToggle then
[07:21:25] <Velveeta> pnoexz: .children() ?
[07:21:26] <Pnoexz> Rohan_Bhangui: method
[07:21:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold up still a bit buggy
[07:21:38] <Sherbert> I had that at first, but I tried changing the sliding method to see if it perhaps solved my animation issue
[07:21:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pnoexz: what Velveeta said
[07:21:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold up Sherbert
[07:22:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> take alook at this
[07:22:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/56A9Q/5/
[07:22:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i use borders its fine
[07:22:53] <Pnoexz> Velveeta: that was it, thank you
[07:23:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: am i allowed to use an on click listener?
[07:23:12] <Velveeta> no problem
[07:23:25] <Sherbert> Yea sure
[07:23:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: always ge the easy ones dont you ;)
[07:23:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: hold up
[07:24:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: html structure must remain unchanged right?
[07:24:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: got it
[07:24:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/56A9Q/6/
[07:25:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> one of the important things you have to remember is to include the simple reset i have in the css
[07:25:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/56A9Q/7/
[07:25:52] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: not always ;)
[07:26:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> well most of the time
[07:26:35] <Sherbert> That border seems to do the trick indeed, thanks! I'll see if it'll work in the CMS version too. If it does, then the easy part is covered :)
[07:26:36] <Velveeta> if more people would read the api docs, there wouldn't be so many easy questions thrown out there ;)
[07:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: you still need help or you figure it out?
[07:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: i fixed it
[07:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/56A9Q/7/
[07:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> no border
[07:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> tru

[07:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> for api
[07:27:52] <Velveeta> no clue, i don't use the bot
[07:28:08] <Velveeta> i'm still fairly new around here :)

[07:30:22] <Velveeta> nope!

[07:30:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> any time
[07:30:32] <grafi> i think somewhere on jquery.com it has a list
[07:30:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Velveeta #fail\
[07:30:55] <Velveeta> there's a bot command to evaluate a js expression too i think
[07:31:12] <Pnoexz> theres one in ##javascript
[07:31:22] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui http://irc.jquery.org/irc-bot/
[07:31:23] <Pnoexz> but no jquery
[07:31:30] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: yeah, it's not advised to use that function, it's mostly for private usage, but is exposed, i wasn't sure if it was covered in the docs though :D
[07:31:35] <grafi> > print(1)
[07:31:39] <grafi> >> print(1)

[07:32:02] <Pnoexz> ` print(1)
[07:32:09] <Pnoexz> bot must be asleep
[07:32:28] <Sherbert> Rohan, maybe you have an idea on where to start on this one too:  Each of those h3 headers has an ID in the real version.  I'd like to have one open based on pageload based on a URL anchor
[07:32:55] <Sherbert> so you could link to a direct FAQ item, instead of a generalized 'RTFM'statement ;)
[07:33:07] <Velveeta> `factoid
[07:33:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: im updating your fiddle
[07:34:11] <Velveeta> rawr
[07:34:31] <VectorX> Rohan_Bhangui well my issue is basically as the second accordian, when you press the a heading it selects the radio, so adding the css classes for the js messes that up, i want to know if the same can be done so it keeps the functionality http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/6/
[07:34:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold up got something that is cool
[07:34:50] <VectorX> the tags can be changed, ie i dont need a <a> tag there if something else can be used
[07:35:19] <VectorX> so im looking for something that doesnt require a js mod mainly unless it is absolutely needed
[07:35:45] <VectorX> im using http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse  by the way
[07:38:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was thinking about
[07:38:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: using the checked attr
[07:39:13] <VectorX> right that would be the way to go if it cant be fixed any other way
[07:40:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: dont quite have the solution but here is what I was thinking: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/r3Spw/8/
[07:41:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: mind taking look at VectorX 's code...there is something im doing wrong
[07:41:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/r3Spw/9/
[07:42:21] <Velveeta> what's the end goal of this thing?
[07:42:53] <VectorX> Velveeta look at this though http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/6/
[07:42:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> when the accordion parts are clicked
[07:43:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> the radio buttons dont get checked
[07:43:16] <VectorX> basically when when you click a heading it needs to select the radio button and drop down
[07:43:28] <Velveeta> drop down or toggle?
[07:43:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> toggle
[07:43:44] <VectorX> so when <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne">  is added radio button doesnt get selected
[07:43:48] <Velveeta> so if you click on an opened header, should it select the radio and close?
[07:44:10] <VectorX> it should select the radio and either open or close/ toggle
[07:44:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> as long as the header is clicked the radio button is active
[07:44:30] <VectorX> actually open would be good, closing wouldnt make sense
[07:44:31] <VectorX> hehe
[07:44:32] <Velveeta> ok, and are you wanting to add the anchor, or are you adding it out of perceived necessity?
[07:45:06] <VectorX> i dont need the anchor its added coz href="#collapseOne" is needed for the script to work
[07:45:28] <Velveeta> because you're using bootstrap components?
[07:45:33] <VectorX> yes
[07:45:38] <Velveeta> gotcha
[07:46:36] <Sherbert> Ugh, the attribute capturing won't work :(
[07:46:44] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/10/  js is included
[07:47:09] <VectorX> so best solution if possible is if no js is changed or introduced
[07:48:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: what do you mean
[07:48:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: show me
[07:49:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: wait why are you using radio buttons to begin with
[07:50:40] <Sherbert> I dont think I can make this in jsfiddle because of page loads. I'm trying to capture the URL anchor (e.g example.com/page.html#div1) and open the matching FAQ item accordingly (the rest is closed upon page load)
[07:50:46] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/17/
[07:52:39] <VectorX> Velveeta ill buy that, is the js snippet the only change ?
[07:52:48] <Velveeta> yep
[07:53:02] <VectorX> ok
[07:53:05] <Velveeta> and gimme a minute and i show you how to do the default-open one
[07:54:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: cant really assess problem without something to look at
[07:54:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> ummmm
[07:54:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: console.log() at key points
[07:54:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> to check if you are getting the result you want
[07:54:50] <VectorX> Velveeta thats the "in" class
[07:55:05] <VectorX> need to have the radio checked aswell though
[07:56:47] <Sherbert> I miscommunicated:  it's not that it doesn't work because of errors, but because I don't know how to check for every div.  Basically, what I did was take the  window.location.hash.  If you match that to a specific div, it'll work
[07:57:21] <Sherbert> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2848627/use-anchor-to-display-div?answertab=votes#tab-top Take a look at this for instance
[07:57:28] <Sherbert> You can check for a specific value just fine
[07:57:51] <Velveeta> sherbert: http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/20/
[07:58:17] <Velveeta> you don't need to check for any divs, just find the anchor with that href and trigger a click event on it
[07:58:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: isnt that for VectorX
[07:58:31] <Velveeta> doh, yes
[07:58:41] <Velveeta> vectorx: what i just said, but at you
[07:58:54] <Velveeta> sherbert: sorry, let me reread your problem
[07:59:22] <VectorX> Velveeta also how would we stop the open, colapsing when you press the heading again, ie, only have show mode
[08:00:05] <Sherbert> collapsible: false?
[08:00:50] <Sherbert> or alwaysOpen: false?
[08:00:53] <Sherbert> err true*
[08:05:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have 2 stringified json objects, is it possible to send them in 1 action to the server?
[08:05:35] <Velveeta> vectorx: you'll have to pass the toggle: false option to your collapse widgets, and manually open/close them based on your own business logic
[08:05:46] <VectorX> ok
[08:06:22] <Velveeta> so sherbert: you want to take the window location hash and do what with it? i'm not sure of the actual goal you're trying to accomplish
[08:06:43] <Velveeta> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes
[08:12:50] <Sherbert> Velveeta: I have an accordion-like page (http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/56A9Q/7/) for FAQ items. The page will show a list of titles, which when clicked will slide out their corresponding answer. I'd like to see just titles on pageload, except when an anchor is added to the URL. This will allow you to send people links such as example.com/faq#faq-item3  to open that specific item on page load
[08:12:50] <Sherbert> and keep the rest closed
[08:14:19] <Velveeta> and you said earlier that there were unique id's on those things too right?
[08:14:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sherbert: i think i understand what your saying.......here is the rule of thumb i use when doing stuff like this
[08:14:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> first learn to read
[08:14:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> then writen
[08:14:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> *write
[08:14:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning first write the code for reading the url....writing is the easier part
[08:16:48] <Sherbert> I thought that reading was the easy part..  window.location.hash takes care of that right?
[08:17:56] <Velveeta> sherbert: how are you identifying these items? a unique id in the h3 tag? in the div? something else?
[08:18:34] <Sherbert> A unique ID in the div
[08:19:48] <Velveeta> is it the div that wraps the h3 or the content? can you put some markup in the jsfiddle that actually matches your setup?
[08:20:18] <Sherbert> Yes sure, hold on
[08:21:54] <VectorX> Rohan_Bhangui, Velveeta i was able to get it do what i wanted without any js mods, now whats left if stop it collapsing when the same header is clicked 2 times  http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/25/
[08:22:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol cool.....see when you provided original code......i was confused how it was working with the sliding without any jquery.....i was like what is this sorcery?
[08:23:25] <Velveeta> that's gonna be where you have to modify the options to your collapse widget and handle the opening/closing manually, i don't think the collapse widget natively supplies an option to say always open
[08:23:51] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: it is using jquery, the bootstrap components are built on top of jquery ui
[08:24:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> i figured that out afterwards
[08:24:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> see the method of .prop that i was using would have ordinarily
[08:24:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> worked
[08:25:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i was missing the fact that VectorX was using bootstrap
[08:28:10] <Sherbert> Velveeta: the code actually produces an extra class on the <h3> now, providing it with its unique identifier. This makes it look like:  <h3 class="accordion-header node-374">
[08:28:29] <Velveeta> ok, reflect that in the jsfiddle
[08:29:30] <Velveeta> wtf bootstrap… i just checked the code behind the collapse widget, it's not even using jquery ui under the covers, it's written as a plugin instead of a widget, how fucking horrible
[08:30:09] <Sherbert> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/56A9Q/9/
[08:30:38] <Velveeta> vectorx: ok, i have a solution for you i think
[08:30:45] <Velveeta> let me try something
[08:30:55] <Velveeta> sherbert: gimme just a minute
[08:31:04] <VectorX> Velveeta if its open its got the class "in"
[08:31:38] <VectorX> so i was thinking, perhaps on click event if class "in" is there return false perhaps ?
[08:32:34] <VectorX> this, check if class "in" / in data-target
[08:39:21] <Velveeta> wellllll shit, that worked a little too well
[08:39:34] <VectorX> what happend
[08:39:43] <VectorX> dont hold back give us the link
[08:39:47] <Velveeta> it doesn't close anything that's open, including when you click on another heading, it doesn't close the previous heading
[08:40:05] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/27/
[08:40:31] <Velveeta> unfortunately, it doesn't pass any data with its event about what the current selection is, only what the current panel being closed is
[08:40:49] <Velveeta> so whenever that event is triggered, the thing is always open
[08:41:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> `weather Toronto
[08:41:23] <b-ot> Rohan_Bhangui: found 6 cities searching for Toronto, please be more specific!
[08:41:31] <Velveeta> and it triggers on the old selection first, then the new one, which means i can't even check to see if the radio button is currently checked, because the old selection has its button checked at the time its hide event is fired
[08:41:45] <Velveeta> `weather austin, tx
[08:41:45] <b-ot> Velveeta: ☔ Light Rain 69.6°F/20.9°C. Austin, TX

[08:43:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> i knew the bot wouldnt get that one
[08:43:46] <Velveeta> sherbert: ok, so presumably, in this example, if someone were to send a link w/ a hash in it, the hash would be #node-100 right?
[08:43:52] <Sherbert> yes
[08:45:51] <Ricaz> How do I check if an object is 'empty'? I mean if it looks like this: []
[08:46:00] <Ricaz> JSON*
[08:47:16] <Velveeta> sherbert: in this case, it's actually closing the selected item at load time, because it's opened by default, but if you close them by default, it should open it: http://jsfiddle.net/56A9Q/10/
[08:47:31] <Velveeta> ricaz: !obj.length
[08:48:01] <Velveeta> `weather vasco da gama

[09:12:06] <VectorX> Velveeta thanks for your help, couldnt have done it without your guidence
[09:12:20] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[09:12:59] <Velveeta> and don't forget rohan_bhangui :)
[09:13:21] <VectorX> ofcourse
[09:13:30] <VectorX> he got the ball rolling
[09:13:36] <Velveeta> yupyup
[09:13:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> well...i Velveeta did most of the work
[09:13:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> but thanks anyways
[09:18:21] <Bauer> How can I do several consequtive POSTs like this: $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } ); but have them triggered ONLY after the previous one was completed? currently they all overwrite each other causing cancelled requests in the browser
[09:19:01] <Velveeta> bauer, you can chain their promises together so one doesn't start until the previous one finishes
[09:19:28] <Bauer> Velveeta: by doing .post().post() etc?
[09:19:33] <ravenzz> no
[09:19:38] <ravenzz> he said promises!
[09:19:42] <Velveeta> $.post().done(function(){$.post().done(function(){$.post().done(etc)})})
[09:20:01] <ravenzz> there is a better way to do that
[09:20:04] <Velveeta> that's a little ugly
[09:20:06] <Velveeta> right
[09:20:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[09:20:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: that is the correct way to do it
[09:20:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> using .done
[09:20:22] <Bauer> javascript is ugly, no choice...
[09:20:30] <Velveeta> there is a choice
[09:20:36] <Velveeta> don't write ugly code
[09:20:37] <ravenzz> Bauer that's up to the coder
[09:20:55] <Velveeta> that can be restructured so it's not one giant nested series of callback hell
[09:21:08] <Velveeta> but that was the concept i was trying to convey when i said chain their promises
[09:21:12] <Bauer> ravenzz: no, its syntax is ugly because of that structure of writing functions inside the signature like that.. its very hard to read, I cant follow the brackets start/end
[09:21:20] <Bauer> unlike in normal languages
[09:21:43] <Velveeta> you don't have to pass functions anonymously though
[09:21:51] <Velveeta> that's entirely up to the developer, and leads to ugly code
[09:22:26] <Bauer> maybe, except most developers do it like that, making reading very very hard, even documentation examples are using anonymous functions
[09:22:29] <ravenzz> Bauer you can define the callback function apart
[09:23:11] <Velveeta> bauer: right, but that's because the language is flexible enough to allow it, that's why we say it's not necessary to write ugly code, it's up to the developer
[09:24:57] <ravenzz> anyways
[09:25:17] <ravenzz> ?when @ Bauer
[09:25:42] <JesseC> Anyone have any recommended books that are good for extending knowledge from basic javascript/jquery to more advanced usage?
[09:26:14] <JesseC> Aside from learn.jquery.com. Looking for physical book recommendations.
[09:26:41] <JesseC> Scratch that, they're on the bottom right of the website. :D
[09:27:37] <Bauer> Velveeta, ravenzz: since what version is the .done method implemented?
[09:27:46] <Velveeta> bauer: here's a non-ugly way of doing something like that (untested) http://jsfiddle.net/zgykm/
[09:27:59] <Velveeta> since like 1.5 or 1.6, i think 1.5
[09:28:01] <ravenzz> 1.5
[09:28:37] <Velveeta> jessec: i would advise a js book in general vs a jquery-specific book
[09:28:55] <Velveeta> once you learn the language's ins and outs, you can apply them to learning any given library/framework
[09:29:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: i think Velveeta will agree with me on this: create your own mini projects and learn new features
[09:29:57] <JesseC> Velveeta: I've got the basics down for the most part, just looking to advance the knowledge to make sure what I write is the correct way and not just the way that "works".
[09:30:01] <Velveeta> right, in addition to book-lernin'
[09:30:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: what are you hoping to learn (general concepts)
[09:30:24] <Bauer> interesting! thanks Velveeta! its nice to see how JS can be used, when properly written and not using endless anonymous chains like 90% of the devs copy from official documentation...
[09:30:33] <Velveeta> jessec: pick up a book on design patterns to help with that sort of thing
[09:30:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: its also about writing code in the fewest and most efficient way
[09:30:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> *fewest lines and most efficient way
[09:31:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> for exmaple, if something can be accomplished in css dont use jquery
[09:31:14] <Velveeta> bauer: no problem, js itself isn't a horrendous language, it just has a low barrier to entry for devs, ald allows for a lot of horrendous code examples to be written, similar to php
[09:31:17] <JesseC> Rohan_Bhangui: Nothing in particular really. Just creating a couple of custom plugins that aren't already available for a site I'm building.
[09:31:25] <Bauer> ravenzz: I get an error: TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'done' - I think the jquery version is lower than 1.5.. I think its 1.3
[09:31:49] <Velveeta> js is actually a great language which is phenomenal at handling asynchronous and event-driven development patterns
[09:32:06] <Velveeta> bauer: yeah, 1.5 is a requirement for promise objects
[09:32:12] <JesseC> Rohan_Bhangui: Oh yeah, I know that. I only use JS as a last resort and try to have as much fall-back as possible so that if it's disabled all hell doesn't break loose. :)
[09:32:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: true. Ya then I would create miniprojects. For example, im building a plugin right now and I am learning new things (mostly javascript functions though) because i created a miniproject
[09:32:30] <Bauer> Velveeta: well I actually work a lot with PHP, and I would argue that it is much clearer than JS (or perhaps I am able to recognize the good from bad by now as its my main tool)
[09:32:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: this is probably the most boring but direct way: look at the api
[09:33:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> and check whats been added every version
[09:33:14] <Velveeta> i personally don't even make considerations about js being disabled anymore… it's become so prolific that i assume it's there, and if a person doesn't enable it, they can just do without my site/service :D
[09:33:41] <Velveeta> bauer: what i meant by that is that php is similarly easy to write really shitty code in, due to its low barrier to entry for developers
[09:33:53] <JesseC> thanks for the info everyone
[09:34:06] <Velveeta> most people can't just jump in and get to it with something like c# or java, they generally have to have some actual background in programming
[09:34:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> JesseC: np. and if you need help with "the new things you want to learn" we are here
[09:34:28] <JesseC> I'd much rather C# than php or javascript lol
[09:34:32] <Velveeta> whereas php and js are scripting languages that are easy to get into and write bad code without knowing it, and then the languages themselves get branded as bad
[09:34:41] <JesseC> Although I hate asp with a passion
[09:34:56] <Bauer> I got your point Velveeta :) maybe I need a to learn a good book on javascript, to avoid those noobish examples and bad habits popular in JS
[09:35:16] <Velveeta> you and jessec should get together and start a js book club ;)
[09:35:23] <Bauer> Velveeta: I am afraid I am stuck to "1.3.2" atm for Jquery, can you offer any workarounds for my needs?
[09:36:01] <ravenzz> I am back
[09:36:11] <ravenzz> Bauer why 1.3.2? :S
[09:36:21] <Velveeta> bauer: you can look into a 3rd party promise utility and make sure you resolve it as part of your post success callbacks, there are plenty of promise libraries out there
[09:36:34] <Velveeta> yeah, 1.3.2 is like 3 or 4 years old at this point
[09:36:53] <Velveeta> you're missing out on a lot of new features by being locked into that
[09:37:02] <Bauer> ravenzz: because its an integrated system to which I hook up, trust me I already tried hacking it and replacing the jquery code... some parts of the system stop working, so I left it at that for now
[09:37:17] <ravenzz> well you could write a wrapper for $.ajax() and fire an event when a xhr req is complete
[09:37:21] <Velveeta> bauer: you can run multiple versions of jquery in a page
[09:37:42] <Velveeta> so that your code can use a newer version and theirs can continue to run the old one, look into jquery noconflict
[09:37:42] <ravenzz> then have a queue with your ajax requests
[09:37:52] <shoky> you can also just use the "success" callback instead of the .done() ..
[09:38:21] <ravenzz> shoky I would suggest complete
[09:38:35] <shoky> ravenzz: complete would be instead of .always()
[09:38:43] <shoky> and that's up to him
[09:38:46] <Bauer> I like the idea of noconflict, will test it now...
[09:39:33] <ravenzz> shoky sure, he wants to execute a bunch of ajax requests one after each other
[09:39:49] <s2013> $("#emergency_access_form").on("ajax:success", (e, data, status, xhr) -> what is e, data, status, xhr?
[09:40:01] <ravenzz> event
[09:40:12] <ravenzz> I guess
[09:40:26] <ravenzz> but wait, the syntax is wrong
[09:40:46] <Velveeta> wait, here's another idea
[09:41:01] <s2013> im looking at the jquery doc but cant seem to understand especially what xhr is
[09:41:02] <Velveeta> if you're running on 1.3.2, the async property should still be there for your ajax requests
[09:41:21] <Velveeta> s2013: xmlhttprequest, the method of transport for an ajax request
[09:41:42] <Bauer> Velveeta: this is not so simple, if I enable $.noConflict (inside .ready) like in the example after loading the newer jQuery, the old code will run fine. But then how do I utilize the newer jquery?
[09:42:23] <ravenzz> s2013 http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jqXHR
[09:42:28] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/ec1a4678949d02e1726e this is my code. it works fine except i want to know how to get the data and set it on the corret table. cause i get a return similar to "door1" : "code", "door2" : "another code" , etc.
[09:42:33] <Velveeta> bauer: i haven't used noconflict myself, but i believe when you execute that, you assign it to a different execution namespace, like instead of jQuery or $, maybe assign it to new$, and then call new$.post()
[09:42:38] <shoky> having multiple versions of jquery on the page can screw up many plugins n shit, regardless of noConflict
[09:44:27] <Velveeta> bauer: since you're on 1.3.2, you should also consider just calling $.ajax() instead of $.post(), and pass 'POST' as the 'type' parameter, then you can pass async: false and it will cause those request to execute one after another
[09:44:35] <Bauer> well its worth a try, as if it works for me, it would be an elegant working solution
[09:44:38] <shoky> Bauer:  var urls = ['url1','url2'];  function sendPost(idx) { if (!urls[idx]) return;  $.post(urls[idx], function(data) { sendPost(idx++) }) }   sendPost(0);
[09:44:46] <ravenzz> s2013 can you prepare a testcase? I am not familiar with coffee script
[09:45:00] <shoky> that's an example of chaining you can use on 1.3
[09:45:30] <s2013> ravenzz: its fine. i think i figured it out for now. thanks man
[09:45:50] <Bauer> hmm I will try .ajax, it is faster to try
[09:47:22] <shoky> Bauer: oops  idx++ should be:  idx+1
[09:49:41] <Bauer> Velveeta: how would I convert $.post( "test.php?getparam=value", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } ); to a .ajax? its a bit more complex than .post...
[09:50:09] <shoky> Bauer: $.post is fine
[09:50:39] <Velveeta> bauer: $.ajax({type: 'POST', url: 'test.php?getparam=value', data: { name: 'john', time: '2pm' });
[09:50:56] <Velveeta> shoky: $.post won't allow passing an async property
[09:51:02] <shoky> good :)
[09:51:04] <Bauer> ahhh, and to that I simply add ", async: false"?
[09:51:18] <shoky> Bauer: that is highly not recommended
[09:51:26] <Bauer> why, shoky?
[09:51:28] <Velveeta> shoky: i know, i don't like async: false either, bt on 1.3.2, it's the easiest way to get the behavior he wants :D
[09:51:41] <Velveeta> bauer: right
[09:51:59] <Velveeta> it'll accomplish the same thing as an async process queue in 1.3.2
[09:52:00] <shoky> Bauer: because it doesn't work on all browsers iirc, and because it can block the whole page's UI
[09:52:03] <shoky> like an alert
[09:52:15] <shoky> until all the requests are complete
[09:52:25] <Velveeta> now that behavior i'm not aware of, so if that's right, that may be an issue
[09:52:39] <shoky> and, my example would do exactly what you want, and it's still very short :P
[09:53:21] <Bauer> hmmm good point shoky, thanks. I think Velveeta's way is good for POC :) then would have to do it your way.. I just dont want to change my whole data structure to your method shoky
[09:53:31] <Bauer> not for POC at least
[09:53:38] <shoky> you can expand the urls array to an array of "request objects" if you want, that contain url and data or whatever you need
[09:56:07] <Bauer> shoky: my current data structure is this way: http://pastie.org/private/wkce9ef36e5rqakuywm1xq I think converting to your method will take a while, so I demonstrate POC using Velveeta's simple tweaks, and later do it properly, like you suggested :)
[09:56:22] <Bauer> with nice sneaky little bastard recursion so no one else understands the code! :D
[09:57:10] <shoky> ;]
[09:57:20] <shoky> glad we could both help ;D
[10:10:11] <Bauer> yes, it works perfectly, thank you both Velveeta and shoky :) will implement your recursive function another day this week :) now off home!
[10:23:54] <kilian123> re
[10:59:32] <Ericx2x> can someone tell me how to do this? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/buttons.png
[10:59:35] <Ericx2x> get those buttons
[10:59:48] <Ericx2x> to show display different stuff depending on which is clicked
[11:00:59] <Velveeta> you could bind up an event listener for click, and hide the old content and show the new… you could also use the jquery ui tabs widget, and probably just style the tabs differently w/ css
[11:01:42] <Erneston> hello
[11:02:08] <Erneston> can anyone recommend a parallex scrolling plugin ?
[11:02:47] <Velveeta> have you experimented w/ various parallax plugins yet? to see what's available out there?
[11:03:54] <Erneston> ive played with parallax.js and stellar.js
[11:04:03] <Erneston> cant find the offical doc for parallax.js
[11:05:42] <Velveeta> and i'm assuming they're not doing what you want?
[11:07:27] <Erneston> am going back to play with stellar
[11:07:37] <Erneston> as i cant figure the parallax.js out
[11:10:43] <Ericx2x> can someone tell me how I'm using noconflict wrong?
[11:10:44] <Ericx2x> http://hastebin.com/womotasitu.xml
[11:12:54] <shoky> Ericx2x: you can't have code inside a <script> that also has  a src. separate it into two <script>s
[11:14:14] <Ericx2x> huh?
[11:14:27] <Ericx2x> can you explain that a bit different so i can understand you better
[11:14:34] <shoky> Ericx2x: line 8
[11:15:02] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[11:15:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> parallax js is so cool thanks Erneston
[11:15:47] <shoky> Ericx2x: also you should probably call .noConflict(true)  so there'll be less of a chance that plugins depending on jq1.7 will fail
[11:15:50] <Ericx2x> shoky thanks
[11:16:17] <shoky> not sure if that matters rly
[11:21:00] <Erneston> smooth scrolling plugin works nice
[11:21:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> any one know of a simple scrollbar plugin
[11:21:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> very simple to impliment
[11:21:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> preferabley configurable so that i can get a simple scrollbar like on gmail
[11:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> (they have a rectangular scrollbar with no scroll up and down buttons)
[11:30:50] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: you can style the scrollbar with css in some browsers, that's probably what they're doing there
[11:31:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> but it works on all browsers
[11:31:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> webkit offers that option for webkit
[11:31:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> only
[11:31:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> nothing lke -moz-scrollbar
[11:31:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> or -o-scrollbar
[11:31:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> et
[11:31:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> *etc
[11:32:18] <Velveeta> gotcha.. we used to do something similar in our products, with a custom track and scrollbar handle inside it, and translating the scroll offset via js, but it was ugly
[11:32:35] <Velveeta> and we had a custom pointer image associated w/ the hover on that thing, which was problematic, got stuck sometimes, etc
[11:32:49] <Velveeta> we just decided to fallback to native scrollbars and style them where it was allowed
[11:46:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> native
[11:46:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> is the best dont ge tme wrong
[11:47:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but there are times (for example, when you need to be able to scroll 2 divs separately, but even then native scrollbars can be done) that it is nice to have a simple tiny scrollbar
[11:47:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> so thats why i asked for any recommendations
[11:49:14] <nafta_> Velveeta: you around? :D
[11:49:24] * Velveeta poofs into existence.
[11:49:26] <nafta_> believe me…I've gotten FAR!!
[11:49:33] <nafta_> lmfao
[11:49:57] <nafta_> Velveeta: I'm bringing the data to the select…and it get's populated beatifully
[11:50:05] <Velveeta> nice
[11:50:20] <nafta_> now…this is the thing...
[11:50:21] <nafta_> hehe
[11:51:33] * Rohan_Bhangui sees a problem/issue on the horizon
[11:52:33] <nafta_> I have a currency select..with 3 currencies I need to work with…I get this json data that I can see in the firefox console:[{"currency_id":"1","name":"CHF","exchrate":"1.09"},{"currency_id":"2","name":"EUR","exchrate":"1.35"},{"currency_id":"3","name":"USD","exchrate":"1"}] Now what I want to know is…how can I work with those exchrate in order to use it as a multiplier in one of my functions? :D
[11:53:13] <nafta_> I'm uploading a jsfiddle so you guys could take a look at my function to retrieve that data
[11:53:40] <nafta_> I have to say that this jsfiddle thing is amazing
[11:54:42] <Velveeta> nafta_: no problem, get it up there and paste the link and i'll take a look, is that currency dropdown value required by the server as part of the form? the reason i ask is that you could store the value as the currency_id if it is, or as the exchrate multiplier if it isn't
[11:55:13] <Velveeta> if it is, and you store the currency_id as the option values, you can store the exchrate as a data-attribute on each option, and reference it from your function
[11:55:37] <nafta_> and no need to talk to the server other than to bring the data
[11:55:41] <nafta_> right?
[11:55:58] <nafta_> thing is I update this exchrates daily from a backend
[11:56:10] <Velveeta> it depends on what you do with that data.. if it gets passed back on form submit, and you need to store the currency type, then you'd probably need that currency_id
[11:56:36] <Velveeta> if it's only for use by the client, then you don't need to make it part of your select options
[11:56:38] <nafta_> yeah
[11:56:55] <nafta_> I need to send it back in order to store the deal ticket
[11:57:16] <nafta_> I need to know in what currency the transaction was made
[11:57:29] <Velveeta> gotcha, ok, get your jsfiddle in place and i'll show you how you can handle it
[11:57:48] <nafta_> Velveeta: if it wasn't for your help last night…I would be so lost
[11:57:49] <nafta_> thanks..
[12:02:21] <nafta_> ok here we go
[12:02:37] <nafta_> this is what I sort of build to populate the selects
[12:04:07] <nafta_> http://jsfiddle.net/3cfGD/2/
[12:04:18] <nafta_> the important part is at the end of the javascript
[12:05:04] <nafta_> the thing is..I want to use the exchrate of the currency selected inside the function updateField7
[12:05:30] <nafta_> so if the transaction was made in USD I multiply the result by 1
[12:05:38] <nafta_> and so on
[12:05:56] <nafta_> I hope I explained myself correctly…this english thing is new to me
[12:05:58] <nafta_> lol
[12:06:02] <Velveeta> yep, looking now
[12:06:11] <Velveeta> had to get a beer
[12:06:19] <nafta_> lol
[12:06:22] <nafta_> to get ready?
[12:07:10] <Velveeta> nope, because my fantasy football team went from an 80/20 favorite to a 30/70 loss, my dreams are tanking
[12:07:17] <Velveeta> and because it's sunday and football and need beer
[12:07:39] <Velveeta> so, there are no options in this select, but i'll populate a few based on the json object you showed up above, so you can see what i'm doing
[12:07:56] <nafta_> oh crap yes
[12:08:04] <nafta_> they get populated from the php
[12:08:22] <Velveeta> right, that's fine
[12:08:51] <nafta_> how long can a fiddle last? this is amazing
[12:08:56] <nafta_> they keep everything
[12:12:48] <sonOfRa> I'm unmerging a <td> with a colspan > 1 into many <td>s (as many, as there was colspan): https://gist.github.com/sonOfRa/6966202
[12:13:29] <sonOfRa> Everything in there applies fine, applying the draggable/click events to the elements INSIDE the <td> works, however assigning the "droppable" doesn't do anything
[12:13:34] <Velveeta> nafta_: here you go - http://jsfiddle.net/3cfGD/5/
[12:14:08] <nafta_> ok let me read
[12:14:11] <Velveeta> nafta_: so if you look at the markup, the currency_id is in place as the option values
[12:14:22] <Velveeta> and each option also now has a data-exchrate="whatever" attribute
[12:14:57] <Velveeta> then in updateField7, after the math is done that figured out what should be in that field, we recalculate it based on the .data('exchrate') value of the selected option
[12:15:52] <nafta_> that was one thing I wanted to ask…I never get to see the content of the select as html..is it possible to do so?
[12:16:19] <nafta_> I mean…after population
[12:16:29] <nafta_> I just see the same empty select
[12:16:44] <Velveeta> nafta_: do you not control the php that outputs the markup for it?
[12:17:00] <nafta_> yes
[12:17:10] <nafta_> but it returns the json you saw above
[12:17:31] <Velveeta> are you trying to populate that select dropdown through an ajax request or as part of the form load?
[12:18:26] <nafta_> form load
[12:18:53] <Velveeta> so then why is there json data?
[12:19:23] <nafta_> oh no yes..ajax request…I will update the exchrates daily from another backend
[12:19:30] * nafta_ slaps himself
[12:20:10] <Velveeta> but regardless of how often you update those exchrates, you could still write that select markup server-side when the page is loaded
[12:20:25] <Velveeta> unless you're leaving that page open for days at a time or something
[12:20:39] <Velveeta> and are wanting that dropdown to auto-update itself through some polling mechanism
[12:20:40] <nafta_> no of course not
[12:20:56] <nafta_> no, much simplier
[12:21:17] <nafta_> I'm going to try to adapt your example to what I have
[12:22:42] <Velveeta> you should be writing those select options server-side and pushing out that markup with the rest of the form, not trying to ajax-load it and inject that content separately
[12:22:54] <Velveeta> that harkens back to the days of asp and its runat="server" directives, which are just gross
[12:23:07] <Erneston> hi again
[12:23:26] <Velveeta> hello again
[12:23:51] <Erneston> am working on this scrolling still, i am thinking about making elements move left to right as the page scrolls, what is required for this?
[12:24:11] <Velveeta> you seem to have a lot of animation going on in this page, what kind of page is it?
[12:24:17] <Velveeta> just out of curiosity
[12:24:39] <Erneston> partly testing
[12:24:41] <Erneston> for learning
[12:24:47] <Erneston> how to do different things :)
[12:25:14] <Erneston> trying to give myself goals to reach, i learn better this way
[12:25:41] <Velveeta> you seem to be heavily focused on parallax and scroll animations
[12:25:56] <Erneston> currently yes
[12:26:05] <Erneston> havent created something i like yet
[12:27:44] <Erneston> css transition to be triggered on scroll? does this sound right?
[12:28:51] <Velveeta> i don't know, i don't mess with parallax design, i don't personally like it
[12:29:38] <Erneston> what do you work with?
[12:29:52] <Erneston> wondering what other interesting things i can look into
[12:29:55] <Velveeta> mostly reusable ui components
[12:30:10] <Erneston> i am interested in user interaction
[12:30:11] <Velveeta> primarily built on jquery ui, but looking to play with polymer sometime soon when i get the time
[12:30:34] <Erneston> thats why parallax was of interest to me
[12:30:37] <Erneston> make sense?
[12:32:12] <Velveeta> makes sense in the sense of learning it to learn it, but i don't like that method of user interaction
[12:32:30] <Erneston> what methods do you like
[12:32:43] <Velveeta> not parallax?
[12:32:45] <Erneston> am a noob so please use terms i can understand
[12:32:53] <Erneston> apart from parallax ya
[12:33:27] <Velveeta> i find that parallax breaks the paradigm of the web, which is interactive web documents that are predictably navigable… it turns them more into a cartoon of a web page
[12:33:52] <Velveeta> there's no predictability about where you need to go on a page once you start scrolling overlays and tiling over content and randomly shifting things depending on the scroll position
[12:34:21] <Erneston> that is perfect for this :)
[12:34:25] <Velveeta> so if, as a user, i think to myself "i need to go back to where that content was that i need to reread", i have to basically scroll my way all the way back through the animations to find that now-hidden content
[12:34:38] <Erneston> its more of a gimmick
[12:34:44] <sonOfRa> Anyone able to help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/l33r0y/A6WF7/ ? Following scenario: If you ctrl+click "B0.1", the large <td> will be split into smaller <td>s. The new <td>s and their <div>s are created in the JS code starting from line 164 (function unmerge). The problem is, that the "droppable" handler is not applied. The draggable handler for the <div> inside the <td> works, but the droppable for th
[12:34:44] <sonOfRa> e <td> itself isn't applied apparently. Any idea what could be causing this?
[12:34:45] <Erneston> but for my test case thats fine :)
[12:34:45] <Velveeta> it's definitely a gimmick
[12:35:10] <Erneston> am searching gimmicks and cool navigation / interaction
[12:36:32] <sunbeam> say I have <div class="one"></div><div class="target"></div><div class"target"></div>
[12:36:43] <sunbeam> and i want to target the first .target AFTER .one
[12:36:44] <Erneston> am not creating a traditional functional website. just playing and learning
[12:36:48] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[12:37:16] <Erneston> first-child ?
[12:37:19] <Velveeta> sunbeam: put up a jsfiddle link to demonstrate what you're trying to do
[12:37:34] <Velveeta> i thought we solved this problem anyway, like a week or 2 ago
[12:38:57] <Erneston> Velveeta can you think of any other gimmicks for nav/ interaction ?
[12:39:08] <Erneston> am not up on the trends
[12:40:20] <Velveeta> erneston: not off the top of my head, but i wouldn't focus on learning gimmicky stuff, for the explicit reason that it's gimmicky… that's like saying i want to go into career X, but only focus on the stuff that's not really used because it's a bad idea and will be a dead paradigm in the next year anyway
[12:41:57] <nafta_> Velveeta: just to be prepared…do you think that sending all this data we are building on the form to a php file would be too hard?
[12:42:02] <Velveeta> sonofra: try instantiating it as a droppable after you add it to the DOM
[12:42:49] <Velveeta> nafta_: so far we're not putting anything but standard form data into those fields, a simple form post would send all of that just fine… the data-exchrate attribute won't post with the form, it's only used to calculate the value of that last input field, which will post with the form
[12:42:53] <nafta_> btw…everything went awesome with the currency..I understood what you did
[12:43:11] <Velveeta> sweet
[12:43:19] <sonOfRa> already tried inserting first and then setting .droppable(). Doesn't change anything
[12:43:44] <sonOfRa> What puzzles me is why one of the handlers is applied, but the other isn't
[12:44:22] <nafta_> Velveeta: but we will get the value="currency_id" which works for me to tell which currency the transaction was registered with
[12:44:24] <Erneston> good advice
[12:44:27] <Erneston> thx
[12:45:11] <Velveeta> nafta_: correct
[12:45:25] <Velveeta> sonofra: that i have no clue on
[12:45:48] <Velveeta> sunbeam: i already said put up a jsfiddle example to show us exactly what you're trying to do
[12:46:19] <Velveeta> sonofra: and i can't even control-click that cell to see what's supposed to happen because in my mac chrome, control-click just pops up a dialog as if i had right-clicked
[12:46:54] <Erneston> i should of said: am curious about what is possible + supported
[12:46:58] <sonOfRa> ctrl-click splits the large <td> into several <td>s
[12:47:04] <Velveeta> sunbeam: sorry, i was scrolled back, thought i saw you ask the exact same question again
[12:47:11] <Erneston> in terms of visual effects
[12:47:16] <Erneston> and interaction
[12:47:49] <Velveeta> erneston: i understand learning things for the sake of learning things, i just try to learn things that i think are going to most benefit me for the time i spent to learn them, and things like parallax are waaaaaay down on that list
[12:48:29] <Velveeta> there's more front end stuff out there to be learned than most people can really keep up with these days, so you have to prioritize what you want to spend your time on
[12:49:09] <Erneston> thats explains why i feel lost and unsure where to turn
[12:49:29] <Erneston> so much learning the basics, but taking it up a level and where to
[12:52:22] <Erneston> unsure of the possibilities sums it up
[12:52:41] <Velveeta> sonofra: normally in a situation like this, i could just rewrite that code sample to change the type of event listener that was invoking unmerge(), or i could set a breakpoint on unmerge() and then step into it to see why it wasn't creating that droppable properly, but i can't find where the event handler is being bound to invoke unmerge, so i can't change the event type to trigger it, and since i can't trigger a control-click, i can'
[12:52:41] <Velveeta> set a breakpoint in unmerge and step into it :D
[12:54:07] <Erneston> bbs must eat
[12:54:09] <mouses> the header of my page has my company logo and a youtube logo linking to my youtube channel... should these be <img> or background-image? and is it that serious?
[12:54:32] <sonOfRa> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/l33r0y/A6WF7/1/ this version uses shift+click instead
[12:54:40] <Velveeta> sweet
[12:55:34] <Velveeta> mouses: depends on whether you want them to be interactive or not… if you don't need people to be able to interact with the images themselves, you could just set them as background images… if you do want people to do that, you can embed img tags to provide the proper dom nodes for them
[12:55:39] <Velveeta> sonofra: looking now
[12:55:46] <sonOfRa> thanks, much appreciated :)
[12:56:03] <Velveeta> ok that works for me, let me step into this now :)
[12:58:28] <mouses> thanks Velveeta. so the best practice for a site's main logo if it's not interactive this? <h1 id="logo">CompanyX</hi> ... #logo {background-image: "url";}
[13:00:37] <Velveeta> i don't know that i would call it the best practice, but that's something to consider when deciding background image or img
[13:00:38] <mouses> #logo {text-indent: -1000px; background-image: "url";} ??
[13:00:46] <mouses> i used to do that back in the day
[13:00:51] <mouses> but i dont know if things changed
[13:01:29] <pixelpimp> #logo { display: none; } #logo:before { display: block; content: ''; background-image: url(../images/logo.png); width: 200px; height: 50px; }
[13:02:02] <pixelpimp> that might not actually work if it's inside #logo.. hm
[13:02:29] <mouses> right now it's just a <img> but i like to keep my code up to standards
[13:02:37] <mouses> so if its not that serious, i'll leave it as <img>
[13:03:07] <pixelpimp> Best to have an <h1> for machine reading purposes -- it's your highest level header
[13:03:28] <mouses> oh
[13:04:10] <Velveeta> sonofra: so i have good news and bad news for you
[13:04:18] <Velveeta> it *is* creating them as droppables, that's the good news
[13:04:25] <sonOfRa> and the bad news is?
[13:04:28] <Velveeta> the bad news is that your droppable configuration doesn't seem to be working :D
[13:04:52] <sonOfRa> that's strange. Because it DOES work for the things it's applied to in the beginning
[13:05:21] <sonOfRa> $(".drop").droppable(timetableDroppable); <- that is called as soon as the DOM is loaded
[13:05:23] <Velveeta> when i export its options object, i don't see a hoverClass, which i'm guessing the other cells have, that's just one thing
[13:05:34] <Velveeta> or maybe that's its over function, not sure
[13:06:01] <sonOfRa> timetabledroppable defines over, out, tolerance and drop. Drop is currently not yet implemented, but over,out and tolerance DO work
[13:06:55] <Velveeta> yeah i'm decorating your over function to see if i can step into it
[13:07:13] <stuajc> mouses: either one really is fine. if you want to use an img and also want the h1 for seo or whatever, you could just wrap them together in a parent div #logo then set display: none on the h1. i use img more often for logos because it's easier to scale the image size in responsive designs, and more easily allows user interactivity.

[13:17:06] <aarontc> hi everyone, I am experiencing what may be a bug in jQuery UI 1.10.3, and bug tracker says to ask here before filing a bug :)
[13:18:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> state your bug
[13:18:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> we will tr ytohelp
[13:19:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> and state your bug form the get go
[13:19:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> a pice of friendly advice
[13:20:15] <aarontc> Rohan_Bhangui: If a modal dialog is opened in a hidden iframe whose size is 0x0, when the iframe is resized and shown, even if dialog("option","position","center") is called, the dialog is hidden behind the ui-widget-overlay and has CSS attribute display:none
[13:20:45] <aarontc> on second thought, I also tested with size > 500x500, so that doesn't seem to matter
[13:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> i cant say for sure i can help
[13:22:06] <aarontc> the behavior doesn't present if the dialog is not modal, so that's my workaround for now
[13:22:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> but as a hack
[13:22:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> you could set display to block on resize
[13:22:43] <aarontc> setting display to block partially solves the problem, as the dialog becomes visible, but it's still behind the div.ui-widget-overlay
[13:22:58] <aarontc> which is why I suspect it's a bug in jquery ui
[13:26:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> true you could play with zindex
[13:28:09] <aarontc> well, for now, I'm just setting "modal" to false, but I thought you guys might want to know about the problem.
[13:29:50] <Velveeta> if i remember correctly, jquery ui 1.10+ doesn't use zindex for stacking order anymore, it uses dom position, and each time one is brought to the front, it detaches it from the DOM and reinserts it before the other dialogs on the page
[13:30:02] <Velveeta> i don't know if it uses a similar method for the overlay or not though
[13:30:43] <aarontc> Velveeta: I think the overlay is using a similar method, it's the last <div> in the DOM whenever it shows up (which is the problem - the dialog is just above it)
[13:38:17] <SuperHans> Hello everyone. Not sure if this goes under jquery or just regular js but ill try here first.    http://jsfiddle.net/3HwgF/3/  <<<--- Im trying to get the 'hobbies' to be typed out in an un-ordered list, rather than just all hobbies typedoutatthesamerowlikeinthefiddle. I've made some kind of attempt for a start with just a <ul/> in the fiddle but not sure how to move on.
[13:42:26] <Velveeta> superhans: http://jsfiddle.net/3HwgF/4/
[13:42:40] <Velveeta> you weren't outputting any actual li's as part of your markup
[13:43:47] <sonOfRa> Velveeta, seems to be a bug in $.clone
[13:44:12] <Velveeta> sonofra: oh yeah?
[13:44:13] <sonOfRa> https://gist.github.com/sonOfRa/6966202 <- using that to do assign it works
[13:44:38] <sonOfRa> No cloning involved, I just manually access the properties and generate a html string for the new <td>
[13:45:03] <sonOfRa> selecting the new <td> via it's id and adding the handler let's it do exactly what is intended
[13:45:07] <SuperHans> Velveeta: Thanks alot! I tried to put the <li> right after the <ul> rather than after html: , which didnt work. And then i gave up :)
[13:46:07] <Velveeta> sonofra: could it be because you're exporting the data along with the node when you clone it? because you're cloning with true, false for your parameters, meaning it's gonna clean and copy over the existing droppable data associated with that node, so when you try to redeclare a droppable on it, it's not gonna do anything because it will see there's existing data
[13:46:30] <Velveeta> with the false that you're passing for the 2nd param, it's not cloning data for its children, so when you grab its children and make them draggable, that instantiation works just fine
[13:46:45] <Velveeta> superhans: no problem :)
[13:46:57] <sonOfRa> mh, that might be the cause, I should probably clone with false, false
[13:47:05] <Velveeta> sonofra: i didn't bother to check the clone parametes you were passing at the time i looked at it
[13:47:17] <Velveeta> you don't need to pass false, false, those are the defaults, try just calling .clone()
[13:47:30] <sonOfRa> gah. I remembered some other clone
[13:47:46] <sonOfRa> which has deep as a first boolean param
[13:51:09] <sonOfRa> yeah, that fixes it, too. Yay for bad memory!
[13:51:19] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[13:51:35] <Velveeta> yeah i didn't even think about the preexisting widget data being copied over when i looked at that clone call
[14:12:24] <nafta_> Velveeta: may I pm you?
[14:17:55] <rrva> $('#my-inputfield').focus() does not work (the selector is correct). It is a text input field in a regular form. What could prevent it?
[14:18:03] <rrva> clicking on the field gives focus
[14:18:46] <rrva> by focus I mean activating the field so the user can start typing right away
[14:24:54] <Pnoexz> hey, is there a slideLeft() as opposed to slideUp()?
[14:27:59] <Erneston> element position animations can be done with css or jquery, why use either/or ?
[14:28:15] <Erneston> transitions*
[14:32:49] <xnome> \join
[14:34:31] <nafta_> I have the following process to get the data I need from php http://jsfiddle.net/xqY4h/ but I would like to know…how can I send data to that script from inputs that have been already filled by the user in order to build the query I need at PHP? thanks a lot.
[14:40:26] <jedimind> MrFox: goddamn thats annoying
[14:41:25] <xnome> he got nothing to do except doing that :P
[14:43:22] <nafta_> Yeah and my question got lost
[14:44:10] <nafta_> I have another one…if I'm living inside a php script…and I have a session variable that I need to pass to another php script…how can I do so thru jquery?
[14:44:24] <nafta_> I don't want to go session_start() and all my scripts
[14:44:41] <nafta_> or is that the most obvious way to do it?
[14:44:48] <AllissonBrito> #php
[14:44:51] <AllissonBrito> sorry
[14:45:29] <nafta_> well, it is kind of a php question..but not really…I want to pass that session variable thru my query script
[14:45:33] <nafta_> jquery*
[14:45:34] <adamsilver> should: $(document).pjax('a', '#pjax-container'); be inside or outside: $(function () { ?
[14:46:21] <nafta_> AllissonBrito: maybe you could give me a hand with this -> I have the following process to get the data I need from php http://jsfiddle.net/xqY4h/ but I would like to know…how can I send data to that script from inputs that have been already filled by the user in order to build the query I need at PHP? thanks a lot.
[14:47:56] <nafta_> something like $.getJSON("file.php", { var1, var2, var3 },?
[15:14:00] <Pnoexz> nafta_: look up form submitting with ajax
[15:14:48] <Pnoexz> oh, your name really is nafta
[15:15:13] <Pnoexz> nafta super?
[15:15:28] <jimmt> after I've parsed something with .parseXML(), how can I turn it back into a string of xml
[15:21:39] <An_Ony_Moose> Anyone know a fancy-shmancy image gallery that just slides through images one-by-one horizontally?
[15:21:42] <An_Ony_Moose> (ok not that fancy)
[15:23:07] <pixelpimp> I do not, but it would be easy to construct one to fit your needs, I'm sure
[15:23:12] <An_Ony_Moose> oh right, and it has to use jquery for the sake of compatibility with the code I already have
[15:23:18] <pixelpimp> assuming you're familiar with web development
[15:24:45] <An_Ony_Moose> Only somewhat. Let's say I've been fighting my way through FOUTs, odd positioning and overflows with CSS, and resizing behaviours with javascript over the past few days, to end up with a mess of 160 lines of javascript and 106 lines of CSS...
[15:25:41] <An_Ony_Moose> I've started rolling my own, but I thought it might be more comfortable to just use something ready-made
[15:25:46] <pixelpimp> well, might be best to use something already made then ;P
[15:26:05] <cam> How do I do $("input:file :last") ?
[15:26:40] <pixelpimp> input[type=file]:last-child
[15:26:52] <cam> pixelpimp, not input:file?
[15:27:12] <pixelpimp> I have not seen that syntax
[15:27:30] <pixelpimp> also, I guess :last is slightly different from :last-child
[15:28:00] <cam> pixelpimp, I am doing $(element).children(...)
[15:28:04] <An_Ony_Moose> Yeah so does anyone know any nice prefab sliding galleries made using jquery?
[15:28:22] <cam> pixelpimp, http://api.jquery.com/file-selector/
[15:28:51] <pixelpimp> interesting
[15:29:20] <pixelpimp> well input:file:last or input[type=file]:last should both be the same then, and should work
[15:31:38] <sunbeam> say I have <div class="one"></div><div class="target"></div><div class"target"></div>
[15:31:42] <sunbeam> and i want to target the first .target AFTER .one
[15:31:44] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[15:32:24] <pixelpimp> `api next
[15:32:25] <b-ot> pixelpimp: .next(): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:32:49] <An_Ony_Moose> fotorama looks nice... except for the "docs are coming soon" bit...
[15:32:55] <pixelpimp> lol
[15:33:09] <pixelpimp> probably not so useful when you're already hacking your way through
[15:33:22] <pixelpimp> though i imagine you can easily copy/paste
[15:33:25] <An_Ony_Moose> blueimp maybe...
[15:33:48] <pixelpimp> hopefully the CSS and scriptage is well contained
[15:33:53] <cam> I am trying to do $(element).append($('<input>'{"type":"file"{)) but it is giving me an InvalidStateError
[15:34:03] <An_Ony_Moose> I'm quite familiar with programming, so it's not so much the code that bothers me as the complexities of positioning et al. in CSS
[15:34:13] <pixelpimp> well that is just weird syntax
[15:34:21] <cam> Oh it's because it's a security issue..
[15:34:23] <pixelpimp> is that } really a { in your code?
[15:34:35] <cam> err there's a comma in there
[15:34:41] <An_Ony_Moose> yes that ^^
[15:34:42] <cam> $("<input",{})
[15:34:46] <cam> That's a bummer
[15:34:52] <cam> I can't add more "upload" options?
[15:35:13] <An_Ony_Moose> but mainly stuff with certain CSS properties not applying depending on the position property...
[15:35:13] <pixelpimp> .append($('<input type="file" />') doesn't work?
[15:35:29] <cam> :< that looks ugly
[15:35:35] <pixelpimp> wat
[15:35:42] <cam> I'd rather use a proper constructor.
[15:35:55] <pixelpimp> that's HTML... o_O
[15:35:57] <pixelpimp> what it's going to be
[15:35:59] <cam> But that doesn't allow setting of "value"
[15:36:11] <pixelpimp> I don't think you could ever do that
[15:36:14] <An_Ony_Moose> is a 5481-byte script worth minifying? x)
[15:36:14] <cam> It's easier to debug when I have it as it's own object.
[15:36:22] <cam> pixelpimp, it's a security precaution I read.
[15:36:25] <pixelpimp> Of course
[15:36:37] <cam> By "value" I want to set the text for the box though.
[15:36:38] <pixelpimp> But I don't see how your syntax gives you any advantage
[15:36:40] <cam> Not the actual value of it.
[15:36:54] <cam> pixelpimp, n = $("object",{params}) will error for that line
[15:37:01] <cam> if I try and append it on the same line IDK what's causing the error.
[15:38:59] <pixelpimp> Do you have a link to that syntax in the manual?  I'm not familiar with it
[15:39:29] <cam> Is there an eval bot here?
[15:39:33] <pixelpimp> testing in jsfiddle does not seem to work
[15:39:50] <pixelpimp> dunno
[15:39:59] <pixelpimp> >> print(1)
[15:40:05] <pixelpimp> looks like no
[15:40:48] <cam> pixelpimp, $("<input>") creates a new input object in the dom
[15:40:52] <pixelpimp> sure
[15:40:55] <cam> except that's it isn't put anywhere
[15:40:59] <cam> the {} jsut allow you to set attrs
[15:41:17] <pixelpimp> $('<input', {type: 'file'}) doesn't work for me
[15:41:18] <cam> $("<div>",{"class":"blue","id":"bluediv"})
[15:41:23] <cam> "type"
[15:41:31] <cam> and closed <input tag I think.
[15:42:10] <pixelpimp> either way with the quotes doesn't work.  closing tag was a typo in irc
[15:42:52] <nafta_> hrmm….can anyone take a look at my code please? http://jsfiddle.net/TcS4w/1/ it is working fine…I'm getting the data that I'm supposed to get….the only problem is….my select keeps growing…and I need to replace the results for the new ones..not append more options to the select…thanks
[15:42:55] <pixelpimp> http://jsfiddle.net/g7aSw/
[15:43:32] <nafta_> if anyone could give me a hand, I would appreciate it
[15:44:05] <pixelpimp> nafta_: reset productName to a blank string?  You are likely appending to it constantly
[15:44:27] <nafta_> yes, but I don't know where to reset it
[15:44:32] <pixelpimp> Scope isn't too clear in the fiddle, but likely it's larger than you think
[15:44:32] <nafta_> or how
[15:44:41] <pixelpimp> line 6, maybe
[15:45:28] <nafta_> how could I reset it? like productName = '' ?
[15:46:32] <pixelpimp> sure
[15:48:09] <Erneston> pixelpimp do i need a plugin for this?
[15:48:23] <nafta_> pixelpimp: it works awesome…thanks a lot
[15:48:53] <pixelpimp> Erneston: for what?
[15:49:03] <Erneston> i have two images on screen which i would like to move as the user scrolls down the page, and move back into place as the user scrolls up, is keyframes the answer?
[15:49:12] <Erneston> you just answered with js in #css
[15:49:14] <pixelpimp> oh, diddn't realise you were the guy from #css
[15:49:36] <Erneston> switched chan to be good
[15:49:37] <pixelpimp> no, and i doubt you could find a plugin that perfectly suits your needs
[15:50:01] <pixelpimp> there are plenty of scrolling plugins, though, like scrollorama
[15:50:14] <Erneston> how can i move the box's 1 step at a time on scroll
[15:50:26] <Erneston> i have tried, stellar and parallax
[15:50:32] <Erneston> i seen scrollorama
[15:50:52] <Erneston> am going to check documentation again
[15:50:53] <pixelpimp> that depends on what a 'scroll' is
[15:51:07] <pixelpimp> i couldn't really help you out with those plugins, but the math should be simple enough
[15:51:08] <Erneston> move down the page
[15:51:17] <pixelpimp> yeah, but how much is a unit of that?
[15:51:18] <Erneston> am not sure of the concept
[15:51:21] <Erneston> am a noob
[15:52:11] <sunbeam> say I have <div class="one"></div><div class="target"></div><div class"target"></div>
[15:52:15] <sunbeam> and i want to target the first .target AFTER .one
[15:52:17] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[15:52:47] <Erneston> .one:first-child  ?
[15:53:36] <sunbeam> .next() right?
[15:54:03] <nafta_> pixelpimp: you remember my updateField8 function? I need to update an input field based on what's selected from that function…do you think I could do it right inside the same function? the input field I want to update it is not changeable by the user…it just shows the percent selected from the dropdown
[15:54:56] <pixelpimp> sunbeam: yes, the answer didn't change from the first time you asked
[15:56:06] <pixelpimp> nafta_: put it where it makes the most sense.  to me, it sounds like it belongs outside of that function, but I don't know your app well
[15:58:43] <nafta_> pixelpimp: I was trying to do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/TcS4w/2/
[15:58:50] <nafta_> but it won't work
[15:59:47] <pixelpimp> not sure what i should be looking at
[16:00:32] <nafta_> oh..the bankPerc
[16:00:45] <nafta_> which is what I'm trying to update inside that function
[16:00:53] <nafta_> besides productName
[16:00:59] <nafta_> which updates fine
[16:04:58] <pixelpimp> it'll always be the last item's
[16:05:14] <pixelpimp> not sure what you're trying to accomplish
[16:06:08] <Velveeta> nafta_: you might want to think about renaming those function names to something more descriptive of what they are
[16:06:27] <Velveeta> like totalThisValue or calculateSomething or whatever they're actually meant to do
[16:06:44] <nafta_> oh I was trying to leave your names
[16:06:46] <nafta_> hehe
[16:07:03] <Velveeta> yeah but my names were made based on generic fields that were just titled "field1" and "field2" etc
[16:07:36] <nafta_> well, what I'm trying to accomplish basically is to get the item.percentage and show it in another field...
[16:07:40] <nafta_> from the same function
[16:08:05] <Velveeta> i'm just saying, it helps both you and people you're asking for help, if things like variable names and function names and whatnot are descriptive of what they represent
[16:08:07] <nafta_> I thought it was a matter of just doing $("#bankPerc").html(bankPerc);
[16:08:25] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what your current issue is, i just came back to viewing this room about 2 minutes ago
[16:08:29] <nafta_> Velveeta: yes, I'm changing those names
[16:09:16] <Erneston> anyone used stellar? bloody offset is not having any impact
[16:09:54] <nafta_> Velveeta: that function brings some data from php..and populates the drop down as we have been doing lately…what I wanted to do is…to get another field populated with the data I get inside that function.
[16:11:18] <Velveeta> so write a function that populates that field, and call it from inside your success handler
[16:12:03] <nafta_> Velveeta: I was trying to do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/TcS4w/4/
[16:14:01] <Velveeta> what is #bankPerc representative of?
[16:14:44] <nafta_> an input field
[16:14:50] <nafta_> non changeable
[16:15:00] <nafta_> by the user I mean
[16:15:23] <pixelpimp> then that's not an input field, really
[16:15:41] <Velveeta> and what kind of field is it supposed to be? text input?
[16:15:51] <Velveeta> and what value are you expecting to be stored there?
[16:16:16] <nafta_> I'm expecting to store there…the value I select from the dropdown
[16:16:24] <nafta_> yes text
[16:16:54] <Velveeta> ok, so then you need to make that .html() assigning from a change event on the select dropdown, not from the ajax request that populates its options
[16:17:06] <pixelpimp> you don't have anything happening when they select an option
[16:17:16] <Velveeta> btw, i still say those select options should be written out server-side as part of the initial markup, not as an ajax request after the fact
[16:18:11] <pixelpimp> it might be better in the end to use ajax if he wants to have things like same-page pagination... hard to say with this little segment
[16:18:16] <nafta_> so I have to make another function to populate that "input" field
[16:18:47] <nafta_> Velveeta: yes but I'm so close to finish this
[16:18:51] <nafta_> haha
[16:19:33] <Velveeta> pixelpimp: as far as i've been able to tell since last night, there's no pagination involved, there are just 3 options for currency types, in a single page form
[16:19:42] <nafta_> pixelpimp: nah..I'm just going to send this whole form to a php script to process it all… Velveeta is right
[16:19:59] <Velveeta> but the form itself is being loaded from the server, and then afterwards, there's an ajax request being made just to grab the currency type data to populate the select dropdown in it
[16:21:37] <pixelpimp> yeah... i think you overengineered that a bit ;)
[16:21:41] <Velveeta> nafta_: as to your question, yes, you need another function to populate the input field… a change listener on your select dropdown
[16:22:23] <nafta_> alright
[16:22:24] <Velveeta> you should already have a change function on that dropdown actually, from some of the code we went over earlier
[16:22:32] <nafta_> yup
[16:22:35] <Velveeta> the one that forces it to recalculate your final total
[16:22:50] <Velveeta> just add your new code into that existing change event handler
[16:25:29] <nafta_> Velveeta: I have something like this View.productName = $('#productName').on('change', updateBankPerc );
[16:25:30] <nafta_> :D
[16:26:24] <Velveeta> what is #productName? that sounds like a text input vs a select dropdown
[16:27:09] <nafta_> productName is a select
[16:28:21] <nafta_> and then I'm going to use the same we used for the currency
[16:28:26] <nafta_> let me see if I can build it up
[16:35:11] <jimmt> can an object returned from $.parseXML() be turned back into xml?
[16:37:03] <sunbeam> pixelpimp: thanks!
[16:37:04] <sunbeam> sorry
[16:37:19] <sunbeam> $(this).next(".list").slideToggle(300).toggleClass("active");
[16:37:23] <sunbeam> whatrs wrong with this?
[16:38:51] <nafta_> hrmm
[16:40:47] <pixelpimp> perhaps nothing
[16:41:04] <pixelpimp> syntactically, it is sound
[16:42:08] <cam> Why doesn't $(element).remove("textarea") remove all children textareas?
[16:43:06] <Erneston> ok ive managed to trigger a css transition with jquery when a waypoint is entered
[16:43:21] <Erneston> only thing is the transition doesnt version
[16:43:33] <pixelpimp> cam: I believe that should work...
[16:43:54] <pixelpimp> Triggered a CSS transition?  Version? o_O
[16:45:04] <cam> pixelpimp, I had to do $(element).children("textarea").remove()
[16:45:44] <Velveeta> what version of jquery are you running?
[16:46:16] <Erneston> 1.10
[16:46:41] <pixelpimp> hm... i see no reason why you'd have to do that, cam
[16:46:43] <Velveeta> erneston: sorry, that was for cam
[16:47:26] <Erneston> oh lol
[16:48:51] <cam> Velveeta, uh...1.8.3 min
[16:49:01] <cam> It works so no worries.
[16:49:19] <Erneston> if you look @ http://chrisspooner.com/my-sites/   scroll down, a 'subsribe to youtube' element slides in and out as you scroll, this is what am trying to do
[16:49:24] <pixelpimp> Erneston: what did you mean by the transition doesn't version?
[16:50:06] <pixelpimp> this is all very scrollorama-y
[16:51:20] <Erneston> i didnt even realise i wrote the word 'version'
[16:51:43] <pixelpimp> sorry, got booted there
[16:51:44] <Erneston> can i achieve this element moving with scroll without scrollarama ?
[16:52:01] <pixelpimp> sure.  but you'd be using something functionally identical
[16:54:36] <Erneston> am using stellar atm
[16:54:41] <deemeetar> Hey guys. I have this plugin that appends popovers on elements that is caled $(elem).popover(). But i want to use it on elements that i don't know when are going to be loaded in the page(for chrome extension). How can i achieve when elements i need are added to the popover function to be called on that element?)
[16:54:51] <Erneston> not able to achieve the scroll part
[16:58:20] <Velveeta> deemeetar: unless you have control of the function that inserts the new content, you'll have to poll the dom for them, which is yucky
[16:58:58] <deemeetar> Velveeta: I don't have:D. So basically i need to use DOMNodeInserted event on the parent container?
[16:59:43] <nafta_> Velveeta: does this look horrid? function updateBankPerc () { $("#productPerc").html(View.productName.find(':selected').data('percentage')); }
[17:00:13] <Velveeta> deemeetar: that's not supported across all typical browsers, when i say poll the dom, i mean run an interval and each time it expires, check to see if there are new objects in the dom, and instantiate them, over and over and over forever
[17:00:43] <deemeetar> Velveeta: I need it to work only on chrome(since it's extension).
[17:00:43] <Velveeta> nafta_: other than the fact that you're not caching that dom lookup, i'd say it looks ok
[17:01:08] <Velveeta> deemeter: gotcha, then you may be able to get away with using a mutation event like that
[17:01:22] <nafta_> and my event listener goes something like View.productName = $('#productName').on('change', updateBankPerc);
[17:01:30] <nafta_> but I can't get it to work just yet
[17:01:53] <nafta_> where productName is my previous select
[17:02:14] <deemeetar> One more question, is DOMNodeInserted fired only when dirrect chield is added or is fired when children to a children is added too?
[17:02:53] <tga> hello
[17:03:07] <tga> does anyone happen to know of a decent form editor that I could use in an app?
[17:03:09] <Velveeta> deemeetar: i'm not sure, i haven't dabbled in mutation observers myself yet, but there is a DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument event that i found on the mdn page for DOMNodeInserted
[17:03:25] <deemeetar> Velveeta: Ok thank you.
[17:03:43] <sonOfRa> When using ajax with async=false, do I get the results returned by the $.ajax call, or do I have to process everything in a callback just like with async calls?
[17:04:31] <Velveeta> sonofra: you still have to process stuff in the success callback
[17:04:43] <sonOfRa> okay, thanks
[17:07:48] * tga is looking for a form editor but can't find anything decent
[17:09:13] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/TcS4w/4/
[17:09:17] <nafta_> that's what I'm trying to do
[17:09:50] <nafta_> err
[17:10:00] <nafta_> wait..that's not it
[17:10:18] <Velveeta> i was gonna say
[17:11:35] <nafta_> haha
[17:12:32] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/TcS4w/5/
[17:12:34] <nafta_> that's the one
[17:13:24] <Velveeta> look at your data attribute name, and look at the data attribute you're trying to grab via the .data() function
[17:15:32] * nafta_ slaps himself
[17:15:38] <nafta_> still doesn't work tho
[17:16:42] <Velveeta> nafta_: you need to combine your 4th and 5th iterations there
[17:16:54] <Velveeta> when you call the .data() function, you don't need to supply the data- prefix on the attribute name
[17:16:59] <Velveeta> just the part that comes after the data-
[17:17:05] <nafta_> what I don't get…is that it is working the exact same way with the currency…and at the currency I also have data-exchrate….and I'm using data('exchrate')
[17:17:05] <Velveeta> you just had the initial one misspelled
[17:17:06] <nafta_> oh yes
[17:17:13] <Velveeta> you corrected it in the next one, but added the prefix
[17:18:39] <Velveeta> now the only thing that's left is that your call to .html() is invalid
[17:18:49] <Velveeta> you don't want to set the .html() of that input, you want to set the value
[17:18:53] <Velveeta> use .val()
[17:19:15] <Erneston> sod it ill switch to scrollerama
[17:19:19] <Erneston> 3rd time lucky hopefully
[17:23:08] <nafta_> Velveeta: it is working, it has a bit of a bug…but it is working
[17:23:50] <nafta_> I have to…purge the select to update the field…it won't take the value that's already there
[17:24:59] <nafta_> I suppose I have to call updateBankPerc function from the function that populates the other select as well
[17:25:03] <Velveeta> nafta_: you can just manually trigger change on the select if you're preselecting a value on it
[17:25:18] <Velveeta> just call .trigger('change') on the element
[17:29:19] <nafta_> Velveeta: worked amazingly!
[17:29:44] <nafta_> if you ever need to buy some stocks..I can help you out… :P
[17:29:58] <Velveeta> i might actually take you up on that at some point :D
[17:30:13] <nafta_> yup, I'm building this to keep track of my transactions
[17:30:17] <Velveeta> our current investment strategy of "vegas" hasn't exactly yielded the kind of return we've been hoping for
[17:30:19] <nafta_> and to calculate profit
[17:30:40] <nafta_> so I can let my clients see exactly what I'm doing
[17:30:57] <nafta_> lol..
[17:31:10] <nafta_> yeah that never leaves the profit expected
[17:31:16] <Velveeta> :D
[17:31:31] <nafta_> but it does leaves a nice prostitute aroma
[17:31:35] <nafta_> :P
[17:31:52] <Velveeta> cigarettes and stale perfume, like a french hooker
[17:43:32] <krystianm> hi
[17:43:48] <Velveeta> hullo
[17:46:47] <krystianm> when i'm sending post via $.ajax(); i have to set data element... for example like this: {MSG_STRING: JSON.stringify(alert)}. If I would enclose the $.ajax(); in my function send(); how do I pass MSG_STRING as a parameter to my send() function?
[17:47:34] <Velveeta> i'm not sure i understand the question...
[17:48:39] <krystianm> in other words, I would like to have my send(msg) function that would enclose the $.ajax(); so that the {MSG_STRING: JSON.stringify(alert)} would become {msg: JSON.stringify(alert)}
[17:49:10] <Velveeta> so it's the object property that you want to be variable here?
[17:49:34] <Velveeta> so if i called it with like send('something') it would pass { something: JSON.stringify(alert) } to your ajax call?
[17:50:20] <krystianm> mhmm... I'll try that :)
[17:50:26] <Velveeta> no, i'm asking a question
[17:50:41] <Velveeta> is it the object key that you're wanting to be variable?
[17:50:54] <krystianm> yes
[17:51:09] <krystianm> cuz... when the data is received by .php
[17:51:19] <krystianm> the data is recognised as an object
[17:51:31] <Velveeta> right
[17:51:34] <krystianm> and... i want to have one upload.php to seve many uploads
[17:51:46] <krystianm> so i have to differenciate the recived objects
[17:51:51] <Velveeta> so is this an object you're constructing to *pass* to your ajax call? or is this an object you're expecting to *receive* from your ajax call?
[17:52:31] <Velveeta> i'll whip up a jsfiddle example and you tell me if that's what you're trying to do
[17:53:17] <krystianm> so...
[17:53:23] <krystianm> when i send sth like:
[17:54:07] <krystianm> {ziibs : stuff} as data in $.ajax();
[17:54:33] <krystianm> i would receive in my upload.php an array
[17:54:52] <krystianm> ziibs => array(of stuff)
[17:55:14] <krystianm> I would like to enclose $.ajax() in send(msg);
[17:55:26] <krystianm> so that i would receive
[17:55:39] <krystianm> msg => array(of stuff) in my .php
[17:56:39] <krystianm> i would like to be albe to pass to send() a name of the kay that would be received in .php
[17:57:44] <krystianm> Velveeta: thank you :)
[17:59:16] <Velveeta> krystianm: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/yWH9C/1/
[18:00:29] <Novalok> I've got a stupid question Having some issues with my code anyone got a minute?
[18:00:32] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure that's what you're wanting to do
[18:00:38] <krystianm> it seams my internet provider is some how blocking it... would you be so kind to pastebin it?
[18:00:39] <Velveeta> novalok: go for it
[18:00:57] <Velveeta> krystianm: pastebin isn't interactive, let me check another site
[18:01:12] <Velveeta> can you get to http://jsbin.com/ ?
[18:01:16] <krystianm> no nned for interaction i just try on my box
[18:01:51] <Novalok> I'm using a jquery countdown script i found online. And using their demo html file it works just fine, and i can edit that file to work, but I can't get the countdown to work on a bootstrap site.
[18:01:55] <Erneston> anyone familiar with waypoint.js
[18:02:29] <Velveeta> krystianm: i didn't write you a solution that's plug-n-playable with your code, i wrote you a proof of concept to show how to do something like that
[18:02:31] <krystianm> Novalok, what does firebug say ?
[18:02:40] <Velveeta> it's dependent on the markup i provided in the example
[18:02:55] <krystianm> Velveeta I know some JS ;)
[18:03:18] <Novalok> Have not looked into it with firebug, until just now didnt know they made a version for chrome
[18:03:47] <Velveeta> krystianm: http://pastebin.com/E0r1J4WS
[18:03:57] <Novalok> Also firebug for chrome will not work on a local html file :P
[18:04:10] <Velveeta> chrome has its own dev tools, which are better than firebug
[18:05:15] <Novalok> Now i'm seeing an error with chrome Uncaught TypeError: Object function (e,t){return new b.fn.init(e,t,r)} has no method 'timer'
[18:05:44] <Velveeta> sounds like you're trying to dereference .timer off of an invalid variable reference
[18:05:52] <Velveeta> off of a function specifically
[18:06:59] <Novalok> I just cant see what differant between the demo.html they provide and my bootstrap code
[18:09:10] <krystianm> Velveeta, so View.propertyName.val() would give me the 'name' passed in send(msg), what if i had two variables send(name,stuffToSend){} ?
[18:10:35] <Velveeta> then you would need to pass a 2nd variable along also… that example is written to the use case you specified… if your use case is different, then that example would need to be altered to match it...
[18:11:04] <hugo_moss> how can i prevent a computer triggered scroll in from happening in jquery?
[18:11:39] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: what do you mean "a computer triggered scroll in" ?
[18:13:29] <Erneston> hi :(
[18:13:46] <Velveeta> hi
[18:15:07] <Erneston> i have found a way around this waypoint
[18:15:21] <Erneston> i could not get the waypoint to stop
[18:15:37] <krystianm> Velveeta, git it :) JS is truthfully amasing language :D
[18:15:52] <Velveeta> krystianm: i know i like it ;)
[18:16:01] <hugo_moss> well im using twitter bootstrap 2.3.2 modal. the modal uses absolute positioning, when i scroll my page to offset 3000px within the page, the modal is animated with a css transition from -25% to 10% but this is from negative some number pixels, to 10%, which is like at offset 50px.  so when i activate this and im scrolled to 3000px, it jumps to the top, skips the transition and just shows the
[18:16:01] <hugo_moss> modal.
[18:16:02] <krystianm> Velveeta, that you very much for your help :)
[18:16:06] <Novalok> I am seriously confused, i copied every single line of code needed for this timer. but when i add the bootstrap to the mix it dies.
[18:16:26] <Velveeta> krystianm: no problem, good luck
[18:16:49] <hugo_moss> now i dont know whats causing the jump to the top, is it the css animation or is it some javascript code in boostrap-modal.js
[18:16:53] <krystianm> Novalok, maybe the order of your .js scripts is wrong?
[18:17:05] <krystianm> Novalok, dependencies?
[18:17:08] <hugo_moss> do you guys have any idea what would cause the scroll to the top?
[18:17:28] <Novalok> krystianm: the only .js i am using are the ones required by the timer.
[18:17:44] <krystianm> hugo_moss, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144805/how-do-i-scroll-to-the-top-of-the-page-with-jquery ?
[18:17:45] <Velveeta> novalok: or maybe some global variable or function reference is having a collision with a bootstrap variable or function of the same name
[18:18:14] <Erneston> semi success
[18:18:30] <hugo_moss> when i play around with the css animation in chromedev, i uncheck 10%, and when im scrolled at the top i can see it animating back and fro, but when i scroll down to 3000px and uncheck, it doesn't cause a scroll to the top, so im thinking this is javascript that is causing this
[18:18:30] <Velveeta> huge_moss: you can start by disabling either the css animation or the js code, and seeing if the problem persists, to try to narrow down the source of it
[18:19:23] <Novalok> i cant find any bootstrap variable/function that would cause this issue
[18:19:45] <krystianm> Novalok, no idea sry :/
[18:21:27] <Novalok> krystianm: I got it working, Fucking bootstrap loads JS weird as hell
[18:22:25] <krystianm> Novalok, beginings in async programming are difficult ;)
[18:23:13] <Novalok> krystianm: this is why i usually avoid web development.... If only C++ ran on the web :P
[18:24:24] <krystianm> Novalok, i was seriously thinking about it some time ago, especialy because there are some free cpp REST frameworks. One can preatty easly make cpp REST backend
[18:25:28] <Novalok> Why not go for it?
[18:25:29] <Velveeta> yeah you can make a back end run on just about anything you want
[18:25:42] <Velveeta> but if you want a client side on that application, you need to learn html/js/css ;)
[18:26:15] <krystianm> Velveeta, true, thats why I'm here ;D
[18:26:41] <Novalok> :P
[18:27:41] <krystianm> but imagine cpp REST backend and JS async front end... what would run fast xD
[18:28:17] <krystianm> have to try that some day xD
[18:29:09] <Velveeta> we run c# back ends on most of our products at my company
[18:29:22] <Velveeta> node.js for the rest, and i think we might have one running on python
[18:30:21] <krystianm> apple people ;)
[18:31:19] <Novalok> stupid question: Can you load an iframe with css?
[18:31:50] <krystianm> dont hink so ...
[18:32:39] <Novalok> Hmm. well fuck :P
[18:32:49] <Velveeta> nope
[18:32:52] <Velveeta> wait
[18:32:59] <Velveeta> when you say "load" what do you mean
[18:33:32] <Velveeta> if you mean inject it into the page then no, if you mean alter the src of it then no… but if you mean assign styles that cascade down into the iframe document then……. well, no..
[18:34:23] <pixelpimp> you can change its margin, width, and height.... ;)
[18:34:41] <Velveeta> yup :D
[18:34:52] <Novalok> lol
[18:35:16] <Novalok> I need a iframe that will cover the .header area of my bootstrap
[18:35:29] <Erneston> how do you simulate an event in chrome?
[18:37:25] <Novalok> well i got what i needed :D
[18:37:41] <Velveeta> erneston: what event?
[18:37:52] <Erneston> eg: hover
[18:38:05] <Erneston> i remember seeing something in chrome's debugger
[18:38:06] <pixelpimp> for CSS or javascript?
[18:38:11] <Erneston> js
[18:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> .trigger
[18:38:19] <b-ot> Rohan_Bhangui: broadcasting an event out
[18:38:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[18:38:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh
[18:38:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api .trigger Erneston
[18:38:54] <Erneston> how can you simulate a, device tilt, from chrome?
[18:38:59] <Erneston> or is this not possible
[18:39:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you could use mouse motion temporarily
[18:39:20] <pixelpimp> f12, hit the gear button in the bottom right, change device orientation
[18:39:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not just hook your mobile device in
[18:39:33] <Velveeta> erneston: you can simulate hover in the chrome dev tools
[18:39:37] <Erneston> heard of gyroscope ?
[18:39:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: i think he means like tilting verically
[18:39:49] <Erneston> let me try
[18:39:57] <pixelpimp> as for triggering an event, i think you might have to do that through the console
[18:40:12] <pixelpimp> you can view it through the inspector in the 'event listeners' tab of the element
[18:40:14] <Velveeta> select the element you want to simulate hover on, and where the element.stye entries are, you'll see a button with a dotted-border box with a pointer over it
[18:40:16] <Richhh> whats the highest number of css ids+classes you've ever seen in a project?
[18:40:25] <Erneston> changed it to ios5
[18:40:32] <Velveeta> if you drop that down, you can check :hover to simulate :hover styles on that element
[18:41:08] <pixelpimp> Rohan_Bhangui: Chrome has that built in, that's what I was talking about
[18:41:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> really?
[18:41:26] <pixelpimp> yeah
[18:41:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> clearly i have not been using chrome beta to the max
[18:41:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[18:41:43] <pixelpimp> it's in the regular build!
[18:41:48] <Richhh> more than 1,351?
[18:42:03] <pixelpimp> that seems like a bit many classes
[18:42:09] <pixelpimp> maybe not selectors, but classes...
[18:42:24] <Erneston> i cant find event listeners
[18:42:35] <Erneston> got it
[18:42:46] <pixelpimp> in teh right side
[18:42:55] <Erneston> this is the site am looking at: nk you might have to do that through the console
[18:42:55] <Erneston> <pixelpimp> you can view it through the inspector in the 'event listeners' tab of the element
[18:42:55] <Erneston> <Velveeta> select the element you want to simulate hover on, and where the element.sty
[18:42:58] <Erneston> oh shite, sorry
[18:43:26] <Erneston> http://wagerfield.github.io/parallax/ <---- it says you can shake it on your mobile device, am curious as to what it looks like
[18:43:31] <Erneston> but dont have a mobile device :(
[18:44:00] <pixelpimp> now that might be difficult to emulate.
[18:44:12] <pixelpimp> i'd suggest hooking into its events
[18:44:20] <pixelpimp> just emulating it by hand with a button or something
[18:44:34] <Erneston> i didnt make the site, am just trying to use it
[18:45:40] <Novalok> So i have a full page Iframe. I need a button at the bottom of the screen that overlays the iframe is this possible
[18:45:50] <Richhh> i found IEs CSS rules limit was 4095
[18:46:07] <pixelpimp> dude, this looks so cool on a phone
[18:46:08] <Velveeta> richhh: yep, i've run into that in the past
[18:46:13] <pixelpimp> you have no idea
[18:46:27] <pixelpimp> Novalok: z-index doesn't work?
[18:46:38] <Novalok> Its not overlaying
[18:46:43] <Erneston> grrr
[18:46:50] <Erneston> i never will either
[18:46:58] <pixelpimp> Erneston: youtube a video of it!
[18:47:13] <Erneston> i will find someone with iphone
[18:47:26] <pixelpimp> s/iphone/mobile phone/
[18:47:37] <pixelpimp> this is not apple specific
[18:48:21] <Novalok> well now im getting it to work is
[18:48:21] <Novalok> ish*
[18:58:18] <Erneston> nite all am done
[19:23:01] <__equinox> how do I disable an element so that it doesn't listens to it's .on('click' event?
[19:23:14] <__equinox> I tried doing $('#instagram-login-btn').prop('disabled', true);
[19:23:28] <__equinox> but then clicking on instagram-login-btn would still trigger the onClick I have
[19:25:31] <pixelpimp> check inside your click handler if it's disabled
[19:26:13] <__equinox> how do I check that?
[19:27:41] <pixelpimp> you already used the function you need to test it with
[19:27:59] <pixelpimp> `api prop
[19:27:59] <b-ot> pixelpimp: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[19:29:48] <nafta_> is this a correct statement?
[19:29:50] <nafta_> var productPerc = (val(View.productName.find(':selected').data('percent')) / 100);
[19:47:29] <__equinox> I wanted to disable all clicks inside my div called registerModal
[19:47:32] <__equinox> is this the way to go?
[19:47:34] <__equinox> $( "#registerModal" ).off( "click", "**" );
[19:53:11] <nafta_> how can I trigger on change on a field that's populated by the user?
[19:58:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: i assume you have some other button that controls whether those clicks are allowed to happen?
[19:59:12] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: that is right
[19:59:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you could do is write an ifsatement
[19:59:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> *if statement
[19:59:27] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: I basically wanted to have a function that disable's and enable's click on a div
[19:59:31] <__equinox> child
[19:59:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> add a class to the button that is toggling
[19:59:35] <__equinox> if statement of what
[19:59:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then when you click anything inside the registerModal div
[20:00:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: does it have to be a function?
[20:00:10] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: yes it has to be a function
[20:00:13] <__equinox> for example right
[20:00:17] <__equinox> I have a login button
[20:00:24] <__equinox> when a user presses this login button
[20:00:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause you can write an if staement within the $("#registerModal").children().on("click,....
[20:00:30] <__equinox> I want to disable all the other buttons
[20:00:35] <__equinox> in that div
[20:00:37] <__equinox> so it doesn't messes things up
[20:00:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well then you could use disabled attribute
[20:00:51] <__equinox> other wise the user can click on the login twice, etc
[20:00:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> for inputs and buttons
[20:00:55] <__equinox> and bad things started to happen
[20:00:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> otherwise
[20:01:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> when a click occurs if the login button has for example an '.userPressed" class
[20:01:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> the if stetement inside click event goes to an event.preventDefault();
[20:02:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: if you provide some exmaple code i can work through it
[20:04:48] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: check this code: http://pastebin.com/5dykG2Az
[20:04:56] <__equinox> so after the onClick
[20:05:03] <__equinox> i tried disabling the button right
[20:05:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me read
[20:05:14] <__equinox> but then when I click on instagram-login-btn
[20:05:23] <__equinox> it still goes printing button clicked
[20:05:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> well here is how i would do
[20:05:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> it
[20:05:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so when you press login button
[20:05:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would add a class
[20:05:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> anything you want
[20:05:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> "pressLogin"
[20:05:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> for exmaple
[20:06:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> then when your #instagram-login-btn
[20:06:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> is clicked
[20:06:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> check wether this class exists on the login button
[20:06:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> *sry i mean
[20:06:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> meant
[20:06:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> when you click inside the #registerModal check for the class
[20:06:43] <__equinox> so you're using a class to maintain state
[20:06:46] <__equinox> i get what you mean
[20:06:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[20:06:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a hack
[20:07:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> not as pretty as a function but certainly works
[20:07:01] <__equinox> it's better if i can disable clicks right
[20:07:10] <__equinox> i think that's a better option
[20:07:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[20:07:21] <__equinox> i am just wondering why disabling the button
[20:07:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> well if your blocking buttons and inputs strictly
[20:07:28] <__equinox> would still go to the onClick
[20:07:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> then you could use attribute disabled
[20:07:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> which is the correct way
[20:07:53] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: that's what I am doing right
[20:07:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think your already doing it
[20:07:55] <__equinox> attribute disabled
[20:07:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i just say
[20:07:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> *saw
[20:08:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> well let me make afiddle i wanna try this out now :P
[20:08:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait so you want any input/button side a div to be disabled right
[20:10:10] <__equinox> here's the thing
[20:10:13] <__equinox> the attribute is disabled
[20:10:18] <__equinox> but it would still listen to the onClick
[20:10:25] <__equinox> it would still go to the onClick
[20:11:37] <nafta_> how can I limit this to two decimals?     var grossProfit = (((Number(View.clientInvestment.val()) || 0) * ((View.productName.find(':selected').data('percent'))) / 100) * View.currency.find(':selected').data('exchrate'));
[20:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: you strictly want to use a function right
[20:12:00] <__equinox> Rohan_Bhangui: yes
[20:12:01] <Velveeta> nafta_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[20:12:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[20:13:57] <nafta_> Velveeta: I've gotten far bro! I'm really happy
[20:14:01] <nafta_> :D
[20:14:23] <Velveeta> nice
[20:14:25] <nafta_> Velveeta: if I have data that I'm not going to show in the form…can I still create hidden fields to pass that data?
[20:14:59] <Velveeta> yep
[20:18:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> __eq
[20:18:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: sort of works youll have to fine tune
[20:18:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/bJT4U/3/
[20:18:33] <nafta_> nice
[20:18:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry i had to take the back door as youll see in a minute
[20:19:24] <nafta_> I have to say that..this macbook pros computer are nice…I know some ppl hate them…but the hardware along with the software makes a good machine…..but man…do they get hot?
[20:19:53] <nafta_> right now I can fry an egg on top of my laptop without issues
[20:20:22] <Velveeta> ^^ this
[20:20:52] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i missed whatever you guys are working on, but why are you using divs as buttons instead of buttons?
[20:21:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> well its proof of concept trying to show that it works on everything
[20:21:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause soetimes some features that are avaible for inputs/buttons
[20:21:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> arent avaible for divs
[20:21:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> though that is changing much with html5 now a days
[20:23:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: sry for the backdoor :D i even almost sneaked that toggleClass in
[20:23:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[20:26:38] * Rohan_Bhangui gets the feeling that he is hearing crickets
[20:27:19] * Rohan_Bhangui and also that Velveeta is working on a remedy for __equinox 's roblem right now :P
[20:27:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> *problem
[20:27:43] <Velveeta> i'm what?
[20:27:49] <Velveeta> nope, i'm watching a movie :)
[20:28:09] <Velveeta> and reading articles, because you know what? stay in school, kids
[20:29:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:29:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh Velveeta i dont believe that one bit
[20:30:30] * Velveeta quickly covers up his copy of "Teh Intarwebz" and says "I'm reading it for the articles!"
[20:33:53] * Rohan_Bhangui says the same expect is watching some risque material
[20:34:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> *except
[20:41:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> __equinox: did my solution help
[20:49:48] <nafta_> Velveeta: do you know why I'm doing this? Well..first because it is nice to learn a programming language...
[20:50:01] <nafta_> but I couldn't find…anywhere someone that would code this for me
[20:50:16] <nafta_> some guys told me they had too much work to do
[20:50:36] <nafta_> some others told me that it was too difficult to deal with equations etc..
[20:51:08] <nafta_> we should have an irc channel where you could have developers waiting in line to work for you
[20:51:35] <nafta_> *shrug*
[21:00:51] <Velveeta> i gave you the name of 2 different sites that you could hire freelance developers from
[21:02:24] <ha1331_> is it possible to have Listview that filters formatted content?
[21:04:52] <jaequery> OT: https://news.ycombinator.com/news , check the post "emacs rocks", nice video if you are an emacs fan or wanna check out what it can do
[21:06:45] * LoRdToLsToI !reg
[21:49:57] <nafta_> Velveeta: yeah I know…but before I started thinking on developing it myself
[22:09:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta_: developing what yourself
[22:09:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> wasnt paying attention to #jquery
[22:09:32] <nafta_> oh..this transaction tracker Velveeta's been helping me out with
[22:09:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> transaction tracker?
[22:09:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> so sort of analytics software
[22:09:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[22:10:01] <nafta_> well..more or less yes
[22:10:04] <nafta_> hehe
[22:10:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[22:10:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya devlop yourself
[22:10:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats the specifc applciation?
[22:10:18] <nafta_> lol
[22:10:19] <nafta_> :P
[22:10:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> some sort of management system
[22:10:43] <nafta_> I need to keep track of every transaction I make for my clients
[22:10:45] <nafta_> on the market
[22:11:13] <nafta_> what currency I used, what equity I bought or sold
[22:11:14] <nafta_> etc
[22:11:16] <nafta_> or bonds
[22:11:24] <nafta_> the profit...
[22:11:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> well how cna they trust that you put in the data?
[22:11:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> honestly
[22:12:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> from a security stand point
[22:12:45] <nafta_> they all get the bank report by the end of the month
[22:12:49] <nafta_> they can compare
[22:12:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[22:12:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[22:13:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> im assuming you are gonna use some sql and php?
[22:13:22] <nafta_> I'm using mysql and php
[22:13:26] <nafta_> with this amazing thing query is
[22:13:28] <nafta_> :P
[22:13:33] <nafta_> jquery*
[22:13:37] <nafta_> damn colloquy
[22:13:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[22:13:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> come again
[22:13:53] <nafta_> colloquy the irc thing for mac
[22:14:05] <nafta_> it keeps auto correcting jquery to query
[22:14:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> no i mean what do you mean by "with this amazing thing query is"
[22:14:59] <nafta_> I'm using php, mysql and this amazing thing jquery is
[22:14:59] <nafta_> :P
[22:15:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> ohh
[22:15:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[22:15:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> well php and mysql is the real magic
[22:15:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery just makes it pretty
[22:15:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> you know a guy called jphase on #jquery?
[22:16:05] <nafta_> how hard is to build up a website for mobile..using jquery mobile? like..I need to make the website structure…based on a design…and I need it to behave in some way for iPad portrait…iPad landscape and iPhone portrait and landscape
[22:16:18] <nafta_> I need to find someone that builds it up for me
[22:16:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you could try google designer
[22:16:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> or muse
[22:16:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you want click and drag
[22:16:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> alternatively you could use a worpress theme
[22:16:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> *wordpress
[22:17:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> but not much customization their
[22:17:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> neccessarily
[22:17:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta_: unfortunately bud, your gonna have to do it manually #nothing-like-good-old-programming
[22:17:56] <nafta_> but I want the iPhone skin to be completely different from the iPad skin
[22:18:14] <nafta_> but jquery mobile is the way to go?
[22:19:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> well jquery mobile is  bit restricted
[22:19:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> esp. if you plan to create custom system
[22:19:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> i highly suggest you create from scratch
[22:19:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> custom content system that is
[22:19:45] <nafta_> ok
[22:19:55] <nafta_> I have like 10 days to build the whole thing
[22:19:56] <nafta_> hehe
[22:20:07] <nafta_> it is not really complex tho
[22:20:19] <nafta_> wow this google web thing looks nice
[22:27:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah
[22:28:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you want take alook at adobe muse
[22:28:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> but its paid
[22:28:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[22:28:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you need help
[22:28:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know my ways around these sorts of systems decnt
[22:28:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can help a bit
[22:28:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> even if the #jquery police arrest me :P
[22:31:05] <nafta_> Rohan_Bhangui: if you are planning to get some money
[22:31:08] <nafta_> it would be nice
[22:31:26] <nafta_> problem is..I can only transfer money thru paypal
[22:32:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats fine
[22:32:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and payment
[22:32:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> we can worry later
[22:32:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> lets just finish this damn thing
[22:32:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> so here is what i am thinking
[22:33:07] <nafta_> alright
[22:33:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> we build the system
[22:33:12] <nafta_> I have the PSD all built
[22:33:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> on desktop
[22:33:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> plai nand simple no fonts nothing
[22:33:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you can send that psd
[22:33:28] <nafta_> ok
[22:33:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have some sort of email or something that you can PM me so i can keep in touch
[22:33:45] <nafta_> yes
[22:34:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> preferably a gmail one by which we can have like google hangout voice calls
[22:34:03] <nafta_> can you make a estimate first of how much it would cost me? :D
[22:34:08] <nafta_> yes
[22:34:11] <nafta_> gmail
[22:34:12] <nafta_> nice
[22:34:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i said I would help
[23:18:04] <ablegreen> Hi, I need help. I have this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/239fc27c0b2e8aa81448
[23:18:25] <ablegreen> I want the console to print 1 to 200 but instead it is printing 200 200 times
[23:18:42] <ablegreen> how come the success function is taking in j as 200?
[23:19:03] <ablegreen> everytime there is a success, i want it to print the value of j
[23:19:17] <ablegreen> but it is just printing 200 200 times
[23:20:54] <jop008> I have a scrollintoview which is fine only the element is just a piece out of sight. You must scroll a small bit to have it in view
[23:21:08] <jop008> one row to low
[23:23:56] <Cork> ablegreen: you need to save j independently for each ajax call
[23:24:15] <Cork> ablegreen: right now you loop 200 times and call ajax, that sets j to 200
[23:24:25] <Cork> and then the callbacks trigger (more or less at the same time
[23:24:30] <Cork> )
[23:24:44] <Cork> and all of them gets reference to the same variable so all of them are 200
[23:25:18] <ablegreen> cork: how do i make it synchronous lol
[23:25:28] <Cork> ablegreen: you can't
[23:25:31] <Cork> ablegreen: simplest way around it is to do (function() { var local_j = j; })();
[23:25:42] <Cork> but you will still get all of them running after the loop
[23:25:58] <Cork> ablegreen: if you need them to trigger in order, you need to daisy-chain the ajax calls
[23:27:00] <Cork> ablegreen: function makeCall(i) { if(i >= 200) { return; } $.ajax().done(function() { makeCall(++i); }); } makeCall(0);
[23:28:19] <ablegreen> Cork: okay i will try that.
[23:28:57] <ablegreen> Cork: where do i put that anonymous function? the first code you wrote?
[23:29:22] <Cork> ablegreen: as a wrapper around everything inside the while loop
[23:29:31] <Cork> ablegreen: except for the j++ section
[23:30:01] <ablegreen> cork: okay, i will try that
[23:30:06] <Cork> ablegreen: the anonymous function is to make a private namespace for each ajax call so they can keep what j was
[23:31:14] <jop008> how can you test if an element is visible on the page (after a scrollintoview)
[23:31:39] <Cork> jop008: you would have to grab it's offset, and it's height+width
[23:31:50] <Cork> and calculate if that is inside the scroll area
[23:31:55] <Cork> *view area
[23:32:27] <jop008> Sounds not that easy
[23:32:40] <jop008> Can I scroll the page up a bit?
[23:32:46] <ablegreen> Cork: Sorry so this is what I have so far and it's still not working: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/829bde889dbec5c270c5
[23:32:46] <Cork> sure
[23:32:53] <jop008> If I conclude it is not visible?
[23:33:04] <Cork> jop008: elementWithScroll.scrollTop -= 5;
[23:33:13] <jop008> olay
[23:33:50] <Cork> ablegreen: you need to use local_j (prob give it a better name) in the ajax call not j
[23:34:18] <ablegreen> Cork: oohh right
[23:34:46] <ablegreen> Cork: it works now, thanks!!!!
[23:35:00] <Cork> np
[23:37:52] <jop008> I have this oel2goto = $("#" + cid ); oel2goto[0].scrollIntoView(true);   oel2goto[0].scrollTop -= 55; the -55 is doing nothing
[23:38:23] <Cork> jop008: is oel2goto the element that scrolls or the element you want to see?
[23:38:37] <Cork> the scroll is on the offset parent
[23:39:03] <Cork> oel2goto.offsetParent[0].scrollTop
[23:39:06] <jop008> wants to see
[23:39:24] <Cork> opps
[23:39:27] <Cork> oel2goto.offsetParent()[0].scrollTop
[23:40:30] <jop008> that throws Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scrollTop' of undefined
[23:40:52] <Cork> does oel2goto.offsetParent() give you an element?
[23:40:53] <jop008> the element oel2goto is a tr eleemnt
[23:41:16] <Cork> ok, then it can't be an offsetparent
[23:41:23] <Cork> so you need to find the offset parent
[23:41:29] <Cork> as it is the one with the scroll
[23:41:34] <Cork> and run the scrollTop on it
[23:42:02] <jop008> yes parent[object Object]
[23:42:15] <Cork> then oel2goto.offsetParent()[0].scrollTop should work
[23:46:15] <ablegreen> Cork: say I want to modify the variable j in the success function, how can i do that?
[23:46:47] <Cork> ablegreen: not in a meaningful manner
[23:47:01] <Cork> as the other ajax calls will already have happened when you do
[23:47:22] <Cork> ablegreen: if you need them to interact you need to use the daisy-chain version
[23:47:46] <ablegreen> cork: what if i set async to false in the ajax function
[23:48:05] <Cork> ablegreen: then you will cause quite bad experience for the user
[23:48:18] <Cork> cause there browser will freeze every iteration
[23:48:23] <ablegreen> cork: :(
[23:48:26] <Cork> until a response from your server gets back
[23:48:34] <Cork> and that is why i didn't even give it as an option
[23:48:53] <jop008> not working try to make a fiddle of it
[23:50:18] <Cork> ablegreen: the sync form of xmlhttprequest (the underlying function for $.ajax) is deprecated, and is only around for backwards compatibility
[23:50:37] <Cork> ablegreen: it isn't maintained, and new features that gets added is only for the async version
[23:51:08] <Cork> ablegreen: but use the daisy-chain version, it isn't that hard to make work
[23:51:33] <Cork> ablegreen: just replace you while loop with the function call structure
[23:51:48] <Cork> and you will have a solution that behaves like a sync loop
[23:52:40] <ablegreen> Cork: sorry what is the function call structure?
[23:53:04] <Cork> the alternative 2 i gave you before
[23:54:22] <ablegreen> cork: got it. i will try it.
