[00:59:14] <stormbytes> evening folks
[00:59:38] <stormbytes> I'm trying to animate a simple box (see example) position and it isn't behaving as I expect. Anyone have a look? http://jsfiddle.net/stormbytes/e0tna5t3/
[01:00:11] <stormbytes> i'm trying to move it down and left on a mouseclick, then back to where it was on a subsequent click.
[01:02:03] <bacobart> you're overwriting startPosition with every click
[01:02:13] <bacobart> you need to store that outside of the funciton scope
[01:50:44] <Ayub> could some one suggest a best markdown editor to use ? I am trying to integrate a markdown editor in an html + REST based application
[02:50:14] <Kev-> Is there a selector for all elements after a certain element? not nested - f.e. to select <p> #2 and the following <p> elements from here: <div><p/><p/><p/><p/></div>
[02:51:01] <Kev-> I see :gt, but then I need the index of the current element..
[03:13:56] <xec> Kev-: you could try something like "p:nth-child(1) + p"
[03:14:09] <xec> err
[03:14:16] <xec> "p:nth-child(1) ~ p"
[03:14:21] <xec> i think.
[03:15:18] <xec> Kev-: http://jsfiddle.net/y9w69ydn/
[03:15:36] <jm116> Hey this is incredibily off topic but i trust this room!  How do I hide my IP in irc using hexchat I just tried to use a particular proxy and lost access to irc alltogether
[03:22:05] <nardev> how can i get status in all sortable divs that i have? serializes, AND using my custom attribute value?
[03:24:41] <Philip_> Hey guy z is there any way to find the id by class name on click event
[03:24:51] <Philip_>  $("#cart").on("click",function( event ){
[03:24:52] <Philip_> 		
[03:24:54] <Philip_> 		 alert($(this).find(".module_name").attr('id'));
[03:24:55] <Philip_> 	    });
[03:25:02] <Philip_> i done something like this
[03:25:55] <nardev> Philip_, 1. what  you want to find?
[03:26:11] <Philip_> i want to find id
[03:26:33] <Hausas> .attr('id') is the right way to do it then, I suppose
[03:26:38] <nardev> you want to find id of some element?
[03:27:26] <Kev-> Thank you xec!
[03:27:33] <Philip_> on click event i want to find the id  but in li there is lot of id so i am using class name
[03:27:37] <Philip_> nardev
[03:28:07] <nardev> Philip_, class name, is not used as "unique identifier"
[03:28:11] <nardev> so, avoid that
[03:28:21] <nardev> could you put some example in jsfiddle
[03:28:39] <nardev> Philip_, http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:28:58] <Philip_> sorry but it's long functionality post request
[03:29:30] <Hausas> What's wrong with the code you've written then?
[03:29:35] <xec> Philip_: if you want the ID of the element you clicked you can just do "this.id"
[03:29:54] <Philip_> ok xec
[03:30:04] <xec> Philip_: but with that code you wrote it would always be "cart"
[03:30:20] <Philip_> yes i know that
[03:30:35] <Hausas> will it, though?
[03:31:32] <Philip_> thanks for help
[03:31:50] <xec> Hausas: http://jsfiddle.net/w7oe8r2c/
[03:33:28] <Hausas> No
[03:33:34] <Hausas> His code was: alert($(this).find(".module_name").attr('id'));
[03:33:51] <xec> -.-
[03:35:23] <Hausas> http://jsfiddle.net/5yp911mg/
[03:35:46] <xec> no shit
[03:35:54] <nardev> HOw can i save complete status of sortable items?
[03:35:56] <nardev> at once?
[03:36:14] <xec> nardev: what does that even mean
[03:37:04] <nardev> xec, i have some items which are drag and drop to some containers, i want to get/save the status of all them
[03:41:05] <bgy> hi
[03:42:23] <bgy> I'm using handlebars to generate a bootstrap template modal, so i do var template = H.compile(element.html()); then $('#modal-container').html(template()); but when I do $(template).modal(); I get an error Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function I get why, any ideas?
[03:52:59] <nardev> how can i serialize all div id's?
[03:53:29] <nardev> if i do $('div.class').serialize() it doesn't return me anything within that div
[03:56:13] <hanuman> Hi, how can i play an audio file from remote server without downloding on my server, I am able to pass the content to the browser.I know how to play a file from url but how can i play  content.
[03:56:59] <Erwat> hanuman: i don't understand the question. please elaborate
[03:57:22] <Erwat> just include the audio player with the content url being on the other server?
[03:58:35] <hanuman> Erwat: My user want to play file,I am getting that file from remote server,I am not authorized to download that, I am passing the same content to browser, It is not playing
[03:58:59] <xec> nardev: so, you have a series of divs with a classname and you want a list of their IDs?
[03:59:34] <Erwat> hanuman: if you show the url to the user can they open the link and see the file?
[03:59:44] <nardev> xec, no i have 4 divs and some other elements in them i wan to get div1>1,2,3,4  div2=1,2,3,4 etc elements
[03:59:54] <nardev> serialized like that
[04:00:05] <xec> nardev: could you make a demo with some examples
[04:00:16] <nardev> i tried this $( "#teaching_group1, #teaching_group2, #teaching_group3, #teaching_group4" ).serialize();
[04:00:38] <Erwat> wait that's supposed to work?
[04:00:45] <xec> what do you have and what do you want back?
[04:00:46] <nardev> but it doesn't returns me anything although there are some elements in those divs with ids ( "#teaching_group1, #teaching_group2, #teaching_group3, #teaching_group4" )
[04:00:58] <nardev> ok just a sec
[04:01:02] <hanuman> Erwat:Directly users not authorized to see that third party server URL
[04:01:11] <xec> .serialize() is for <form>s
[04:01:30] <nardev> xec, ok, is there something that i can use?
[04:01:36] <nardev> in my case?
[04:01:42] <xec> nardev: probably. what is your case?
[04:01:52] <Erwat> hanuman: if that server has to give information to the user then how do you plan on hiding the url from the user?
[04:02:13] <den_> huh
[04:02:29] <hanuman> Erwat:Using api authorization token
[04:02:41] <Erwat> ????
[04:02:47] <Erwat> that third server is serving a file to the user
[04:03:20] <Erwat> how does the information go from the third server to the user without the user connecting to the server?
[04:03:21] <hanuman> Erwat:No that serving file to my serveruser connects to my server
[04:03:30] <nardev> Erwat, xec this http://jsfiddle.net/89dk3h9y/
[04:03:45] <Erwat> so you're saying YOUR server is going to serve the file?
[04:03:58] <hanuman> Erwat:yes
[04:04:16] <Erwat> hanuman: and how do you plan on serving a file you don't have?
[04:04:37] <xec> nardev: ok, what do you want out of this?
[04:04:38] <nardev> xec, i want output like this // output teaching_group1=1,2&teaching_group2=4,5   from this http://jsfiddle.net/89dk3h9y/
[04:04:53] <nardev> xec, i want output like this // output teaching_group1=1,2&teaching_group2=4,5
[04:04:56] <xec> right
[04:05:18] <nardev> xec, if possible serialized in json...
[04:06:21] <hanuman> Erwat:I am getting file content from thisrd party server like this HTTP/1.1 200 OK Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 31392 Content-Type: audio/mpeg Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2015 00:16:11 GMT Server: nginx Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: DENY content-disposition: attachment; filename=770829b7addf0a70c25ddf370914e3270.mp3

[04:07:16] <hanuman> Erwat:Any suggestion
[04:07:30] <hanuman> Erwat:Any suggestion in another way to do
[04:07:37] <Erwat> i have none, at least none where you don't actually download the file...
[04:08:20] <juslintek> Can anyone help to render google captcha when jquery .html is done which contains the div with id of recaptcha?
[04:08:34] <nardev> Erwat, could it be perhaps due to cross browser protection?
[04:08:44] <nardev> xec,
[04:08:52] <nardev> xec, _
[04:08:52] <xec> nardev: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/89dk3h9y/1/
[04:08:55] <nardev> thnx
[04:10:19] <nardev> xec thank you very mmuch
[04:10:50] <juslintek> Anyone done anything with google recaptcha?
[04:11:03] <juslintek> Especially when loading it with .html
[04:11:50] <xec> nardev: to make it JSON you can use JSON.stringify()
[04:12:00] <nardev> xec, ok thank you
[04:12:36] <xec> note that the IDs will always be strings, so you might want to parseInt() them too
[05:34:02] <Erwat> is there a :hasAttr pseudo?
[05:34:28] <Erwat> i'm getting an error after concatenating files but originally it works without this error
[05:35:02] <R13ose> If I have a div that has z-index of -1 and I want to access the alt of an image within that div by hovering over that image, how do I do that?
[05:37:15] <shoky> Erwat:  http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[05:38:41] <Erwat> shoky: i was thinking more along the lines of
[05:38:45] <Erwat> self.html.find(':hasAttr
[05:39:16] <shoky> there's no :hasAttr pseudo
[05:39:26] <Erwat> i'that's really weird!
[05:39:53] <Erwat> because if i don't concatenate all of this into one file using requirejs' optimizer it works fine (that particular code
[05:40:55] <shoky> no idea what yer talking about
[05:42:39] <R13ose> Erwat: what is the error?
[05:44:02] <Erwat> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: hasAttr
[05:47:05] <Erwat> okay nevermind idk why it happens
[05:47:06] <Erwat> seems like something else
[05:49:16] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[05:54:26] <shoky> R13ose is there something in front of that div so that you can't really hover the mouse over it?
[05:55:51] <R13ose> shoky: yes.
[05:56:39] <shoky> in modern browsers you can try pointer-events:none on the blocking element.. tho that could interfere with other things
[05:57:18] <shoky> otherwise.. you gotta manually check the mouse coordinates on every mousemove, i guess. cause you're not really hovering over it
[05:58:02] <R13ose> shoky: you want to see the live example?
[05:58:11] <shoky> ok
[06:01:34] <R13ose> shoky: http://ecosanity.org/ when you hover over the background image, a box with thumbnails should show up at the bottom of the image.  I want the alt of the current image to show up in that box automatically.
[06:03:33] <ewz> R13ose: you could attach a hover event or something. Like $('#element-on-top).hover(function (){ var show_this = $("#element-underneath").attr('alt'); $(this).attr('alt',show_this); });
[06:03:48] <lemonsparrow> is there a way to calculate median of an array in jquery ?
[06:06:07] <mrchris_> Hi all. I'm confused.  When I call alert($('#48_start_at').val())  at a certain point in my code it shows an empty alert message, but when I do it from the console it shows me what is in that text box.  How can thiss happen?
[06:06:07] <shoky> R13ose: i don't see the problem. you're already getting the hovered image's alt in your code  (slideshow.js line 32)
[06:07:24] <bbclover> Hey guys, what does $("#someid").get(0).style.display do? ids should be unique, so is the get(0) needed?
[06:07:27] <R13ose> ewz: I tried that but the alt is on the image with the z-index: -1
[06:07:37] <bbclover> and is get() a jquery function?
[06:07:37] <ewz> lemonsparrow: There isn't a function built in to find the median of an array, but here's a page you should look at. The second answer has a function that looks like it would work well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25305640/find-median-values-from-array-in-javascript-8-values-or-9-values
[06:07:49] <bbclover> o found the doc
[06:07:56] <bbclover> was getting the ajax one on the initial google
[06:09:07] <ewz> R13ose: right, you get the alt attribute from the hidden element, and make it the alt attribute value of the element on top... Is that what you tried?
[06:09:40] <R13ose> shoky: yes, I am hovering the image's alt but that is for the thumbnails.  I am saying that when you hover over to show the box, there is no sentence and want to show the current big image alt there.
[06:11:11] <ewz> @R13ose: I looked at your page and I want to make sure I understand what you want to happen...
[06:12:13] <R13ose> ewz: sure
[06:12:26] <ewz> You have all those broken image squares. When you hover over one of those the main image should change, which is currently working, right?
[06:14:12] <R13ose> ewz: Right and fixing the broken image squares.
[06:15:07] <ewz> But you also want a message to appear - similar to the function of an alt attribute on an anchor element - which is not working, right?
[06:15:37] <shoky> R13ose:  var slidenum = $('.slides').data('cycle.opts').currSlide;  $('.slides').children().eq(slidenum).attr('alt')
[06:16:19] <R13ose> ewz: yes as soon as the thumbnails show up.
[06:18:49] <R13ose> shoky: let me try that
[06:19:59] <ewz> To me it looks like it's already working, you just need to format the text
[06:22:22] <FoolsRun> Hello, I'm looking for some help adding/removing classes from a fairly large number of elements (up to 100 elements). I have five different classes that might be added, based on arrays passed to my function, and those classes are added at a random delay between 0 and 500. It works great on desktops but my iPad chokes on it. Can anyone help me figure out how to optimize this?
[06:24:19] <R13ose> shoky: not sure if I put that in the right place.  I added your code.
[06:24:27] <R13ose> ewz: let me fix the thumbnails.
[06:24:51] <ewz> FoolsRun: what are you using to add/remove classes?
[06:25:17] <ewz> .addclass and .removeClass or something else?
[06:25:21] <FoolsRun> ewz: Well, here's one example:  $(target + " .grid div").eq(l).delay(d).addClass('top-left grid-' + l, delay*2, "easeInOutQuint");
[06:25:27] <FoolsRun> ewz: addClass
[06:25:53] <FoolsRun> I guess the easing might be taking up more memory than I strictly need to use.
[06:27:05] <ewz> maybe. Take a look at this too. This guy seems to have had a similar issue and seems to have solved it by embedding the add/remove in a live function: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7227330/jquery-mobile-issue-using-removeclass-and-addclass-not-working
[06:27:17] <bbclover> Hey guys, what does $("#someid").get(0).style.display do? ids should be unique, so is the get(0) needed?
[06:28:01] <FoolsRun> ewz: I've also read that caching my DOM elements might help, but I can't see how to do that if I'm just adding classes once per animation.
[06:28:14] <ewz> bbClover: you should be able to do something like $("#some-id").css("display")
[06:29:46] <shoky> R13ose: you want that to happen when the toolbox is opened, no? not when you hover over the images
[06:30:28] <R13ose> shoky: I want this to happen when the toolbox is open yes but an hovering the box images.
[06:30:36] <FoolsRun> Here's another question: I'm doing 5 .each's to find and add classes to the elements. Would it be less expensive to somehow combine the arrays I'm iterating over into a single array and to a single .each ?
[06:31:32] <ewz> FoolsRun: Yeah I guess if you trigger the browser's reflow you could get the stack all messed up. See if this helps: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/javascript-dom
[06:33:10] <ewz> FoolsRun: for your second question: yeah 5 each's seems unneccessary if they're all doing the same thing. What does your code look like? Do you know how to use 'this'?
[06:34:46] <R13ose> ewz: for the thumbnails not showing up.  In Chrome, they come out perfect and in Firefox they have two of these " around them.  Here is the code: $(slide).css('background-image').replace('url(','').replace(')','')  What am I doing wrong?
[06:35:54] <FoolsRun> ewz: The goal is a 10x10 grid of squares that I can turn on and off, like the game "Lights Out". I have 5 arrays of numbers indicating which elements should have which classes applied to them (full on, or just one of the four corners on). I'm iterating through the arrays one by one like this:  http://pastebin.com/phE0bVpk
[06:36:50] <ewz> R13ose: that seems like a bit of a mess, break that out into multiple steps: var bg_url = $(slide).css('background-image');
[06:37:14] <FoolsRun> ewz: that applies the "on" class, there are also "top-left", "top-right", etc.
[06:37:16] <ewz> var new_url = bg_url.replace...
[06:37:49] <ewz> and then do the next replace on another line
[06:39:06] <ewz> and print all that out one at a time to see where you're messing up. Try to keep one function on one line. You can use a minifier if it takes too long to load later on
[06:40:42] <HumanBeing> Hi.  been getting errors using a counter script I downloaded via jquery.com wondering if anyone could help.  TypeError: c.options is undefined
[06:40:48] <ewz> Foolsrun: I'm checking that out, one sec
[06:41:40] <ewz> FoolsRun: I can't access PasteBin from my network, can you put it on fiddle or something?
[06:41:42] <FoolsRun> ewz: I appreciate it. Javascript is not my strong suit.
[06:42:26] <FoolsRun> ewz:  http://jsfiddle.net/dengfa1v/
[06:43:04] <ewz> R13ose: maybe take a look at this to change the bg-image url: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/253689/switching-a-div-background-image-with-jquery
[06:43:19] <R13ose> ewz: okay
[06:46:00] <ewz> FoolsRun: try putting one function on one line, you can use a minifier later if it loads too slowly. That will allow us to see where the problem is
[06:48:19] <ewz> FoolsRun: also I have never used the eq function. There always seems to be a better way, so I'm going to break your one line into multiple lines and try to figure out what you're trying to accomplish
[06:49:09] <FoolsRun> ewz: eq is giving me the nth element so I can apply a class to it
[06:50:12] <ewz> right, I know what it does, I'm saying that there always seems to be a better way
[06:52:19] <ewz> FoolsRun: sorry, rereading that it sounds mean. Didn't mean to sound mean there
[06:52:39] <R13ose> ewz: I was able to get the thumbnails to show up.
[06:53:11] <R13ose> ewz: what about the other issue?
[06:58:57] <ewz> FoolsRun: take a look at this, I just cleaned it up a little. See if that helps you see the issue better: http://jsfiddle.net/dn0kmzhs/
[06:59:56] <ewz> R13ose: remind me what the other issue is please
[07:02:19] <ewz> R13ose: so here's what I see: when I hover over the images, a line of text appears above in the same location. But you want something like an alt to appear that has different text, right? In addition to the central text specific to each image?
[07:03:28] <R13ose> ewz: When I hover over the big images (background-image(s)), the popup thumbnails come up and I want to take the alt of the big images and put that above the thumbnails.
[07:03:29] <ewz> FoolsRun: sorry forgot the param: http://jsfiddle.net/dn0kmzhs/1/
[07:03:58] <ewz> AH
[07:04:01] <ewz> K, one sec
[07:06:55] <ewz> R13ose: so what class signifies what the current bg-image is? It lookw to me like you're just changing css on the fly, if that is the case you should be putting all that css into a class and do .addClass('new-class-that-says-which-bg-image-is-active')
[07:07:06] <ewz> and removeClass() respectively instead of changing css
[07:07:59] <ewz> that way you can say "var IWantThisAlt = $('.active-image').attr("alt");"
[07:08:35] <ewz> Then you can say $("#cover p").text(IWantThisAlt);
[07:10:21] <ewz> Otherwise, if you wanted to base it off of which element is currently visible, that's doable but very messy
[07:11:51] <R13ose> ewz: I get what you are saying.  Add some sort of active image class to the image that is showing up.  I will do that.
[07:12:21] <R13ose> ewz: trying
[07:13:17] <ewz> Yes. Also, and maybe this is just part of something else you downloaded to get a slideshow, but all of your big images are the same id. That's not generally a good idea. they should be based on classes, not ids, but again if this is someone else's code probly don't mess with it cuz it seems to be working
[07:14:10] <ewz> But I have seen things get messed up in jquery when using an id more than once on a page
[07:14:43] <R13ose> ewz: I should change id="slideimage" to class="slideimage"?
[07:17:54] <ewz> I would
[07:18:47] <ewz> If it was my code. If this is someone else's slideshow program don't do it
[07:18:47] <R13ose> ewz: okay thanks
[07:19:28] <ewz> so the active slideshow element would be class="slideshow active" or something
[07:19:47] <Erwat> ewz: i'm pretty sure ids are unique
[07:20:11] <ewz> then your css that targets the active element is .active.slideshow{ }
[07:20:50] <ewz> Erwat: yeah, that's what I'm saying. R13ose has a bunch of elements with the same ids
[07:21:06] <ewz> *id
[07:21:25] <R13ose> ewz: I changed that and working on active.
[07:21:31] <ewz> cool
[07:33:40] <effortDee> using jquery.bxslider and swipeThreshold not working, any ideas? It needs touchEnabled: true which i've set bt just wont work
[07:48:54] <R13ose> ewz: I think I got the active to add but I can't remove this.  I am using before and after which are options of the slideshow.  Any thoughts?
[07:49:39] <ewz> This may be obvious, but did you try .removeClass()?
[07:51:23] <jaspertheghost> is there a away to init a $('#div').widget_name({ .. }); anyway to init a widget without binding it to an element?
[07:53:48] <JSDinosaur> can someone explain why "ar2" in this jsfiddle is empty? http://jsfiddle.net/z7eestLr/1/
[07:53:51] <R13ose> ewz: this is the code I tried: $(this).parent().find('.slides a.active').removeClass();
[07:54:58] <ewz> What is 'this'? a specific slideshow element? like $("a.slideshow")
[07:55:24] <ewz> i guess it doesn't matter
[07:55:44] <ewz> try this $('.active').removeClass('active')
[07:55:50] <R13ose> ewz: $('.slides').cycle
[07:56:21] <ewz> $('.active').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active');
[07:57:22] <JSDinosaur> anyone?
[07:58:45] <BillCriswell> JSDinosaur: You forgot the return.
[07:59:16] <R13ose> ewz: I think this only works in certain situations, everything that I have put in.
[07:59:21] <BillCriswell> JSDinosaur: $.map(ar, function(value, index) { return value; });
[07:59:39] <JSDinosaur> BillCriswell: thanks :)
[07:59:45] <ewz> R13ose is it live?
[07:59:54] <R13ose> ewz: yes.
[08:00:14] <R13ose> ewz: the same site as before.
[08:00:31] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:01:05] <ewz> R13ose check your console you have errors
[08:01:19] <R13ose> ewz: fixing them
[08:02:42] <hlvwrk> cvsd vkdjsnvjsd
[08:02:43] <ewz> R13ose also, in what js file are you making these changes?
[08:03:44] <R13ose> ewz: slideshow.js
[08:06:37] <ewz> R13ose To solve your issue with the caption look at this line:
[08:06:40] <ewz> caption.text($('.slides').children().eq(slidenum).attr('alt'));
[08:10:02] <R13ose> ewz: yes and?  I am not sure that will work either.  I know the line I commented out will work but it is the hover that is not.
[08:12:52] <ewz> R13ose if we assume caption.text works as it should, by changing the text of the caption element, and assume that $('.slides').children... works in getting the correct alt, then the whole thing should work, right?
[08:13:35] <R13ose> ewz: yes but $('.slides a').hover is the issue in my mind not the code within.
[08:15:39] <ewz> R13ose OK, I can't tell what $('.slides') is right now because of that error, so start commenting stuff out untill the error goes away, and figure out what is causing it
[08:15:55] <R13ose> ewz: okay one sec
[08:16:09] <ewz> k
[08:23:12] <R13ose> ewz: I have found the problem and not fixing this.
[08:23:57] <ewz> What's the probelm?
[08:24:39] <ewz> Actually, lets start a pm so I can give this more attention
[09:22:27] <Es0teric> if you want to find a class using .find
[09:22:29] <Es0teric> how would you do it?
[09:22:35] <robertmaxrees> .find('.class')
[09:23:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: thats not working for me for some reason… i am doing something like this.dom.find(’.myClass')
[09:23:10] <Es0teric> where dom contains the parent element
[09:23:11] <robertmaxrees> is this.dom a jquery object?
[09:23:18] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i believe so
[09:23:37] <robertmaxrees> then your class isn't a child of that element.
[09:28:10] <robertmaxrees> open your console and see if you get any errors.
[09:37:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i get no errors but i do see an object
[09:38:04] <robertmaxrees> something isn't making sense.
[09:38:33] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i had to access the property “wrapall” which is in the object
[09:38:43] <Es0teric> so it was this.dom.wrapall.find()
[09:38:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> wait is dom a collection?
[09:39:05] <robertmaxrees> that contains your element?
[09:42:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ejmogx12/ for more info.
[09:45:22] <bradfordli123> robotman321[nato: hey you helped me yesterday with a problem but I couldnt get it to work =/
[09:50:30] <Es0teric> alright so when checking for empty values in an input field for a form submit, whats better? on click or onsubmit?
[09:50:37] <robertmaxrees> on submit of the form.
[09:51:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok but i want to do something like.. if the input field is blank to prevent the submit from executing
[09:51:47] <robertmaxrees> if (theInput.val().length === 0) { e.preventDefault(); }
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> easy peasy
[09:52:05] <Paradisee_> how can i remove in the float numer: 12.345 the decimals in eccess to be ->> 12.3 ?
[09:53:43] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee_ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832914/round-to-at-most-2-decimal-places-in-javascript
[09:54:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: its still going through
[09:54:00] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Es0teric
[09:54:00] <b-ot> Es0teric: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:54:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not a complete example btw.
[09:54:22] <Es0teric> i have an input field and a submit.. i am just trying to prevent the button from being pressed before anything is inserted into it
[09:54:31] <Es0teric> so should i just listen for a keyup event?
[09:54:38] <Es0teric> and disable it until the keyup happens
[09:54:44] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you're not making sense.
[09:54:49] <robertmaxrees> paste up please :)
[09:54:56] <royalty> what i would do
[09:55:02] <royalty> is start with a disabled attribute
[09:55:04] <royalty> on the submit
[09:55:12] <royalty> whenever something is entered into the input
[09:55:12] <Es0teric> royalty: thats what i am trying to say
[09:55:15] <Es0teric> that would be more effective right?
[09:55:23] <royalty> just remove the disabled attribute
[09:55:29] <robertmaxrees> wll that disable form submit on enter keypress?
[09:55:52] <royalty> doesn't it?
[09:55:57] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue.
[09:56:06] <robertmaxrees> but the way i'd suggest is a lot cleaner imo.
[09:57:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p0aphvt8/ something like this.
[09:59:19] <royalty> ah yeah that's easier because you only have to listen on submit
[09:59:26] <royalty> not on input fill
[09:59:42] <robertmaxrees> this is oversiplified.
[10:00:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd want to setup a validator of some kind to check if all your inputs are filled, but this should give you the general idea.
[10:00:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, royalty http://pastebin.com/3q2BktzD
[10:00:49] <Es0teric> that accomplishes what i want it to do
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric look at my fiddle.
[10:01:34] <R13ose> Oh my
[10:01:41] <royalty> i would not use that solution since what if it is filled out without them even clicking on it or anything due to autocomplete
[10:02:03] <royalty> i have written a validator lol
[10:02:05] <robertmaxrees> you're making a lot of assumptions with that code.
[10:02:18] <royalty> but i think it's overkill
[10:02:32] <robertmaxrees> i have written a few validators - they're always a PITA.
[10:02:52] <royalty> mine is more like a plug in, it requires labels on inputs though
[10:03:16] <royalty> you could even check if it's a valid email, based on the most basic things
[10:03:54] <royalty> Es0teric, https://github.com/Modicrumb/pureValidator
[10:04:00] <royalty> if you are interested
[10:04:01] <royalty> lolll
[10:04:27] <R13ose> ewz: still around?
[10:04:34] <royalty> it requires a few things though, and there is probably a more involved jquery one out there
[10:05:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate is a popular choice.
[10:05:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/4yqLgUA2
[10:06:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i even tried !email.length === 0 on line 5
[10:06:40] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* why not make a simplified fiddle?
[10:07:46] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p0aphvt8/3/
[10:07:52] <robertmaxrees> this works fine.
[10:08:56] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: well thats not executing for me and i dont see any console errors
[10:09:03] <Es0teric> thats still doing the default
[10:09:06] <robertmaxrees> your code's in a document ready?
[10:09:16] <robertmaxrees> or after the form code?
[10:09:39] <robertmaxrees> are your selectors correct?  lots of things I cannot see.
[10:11:20] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: its when the header is ready so yes on document ready
[10:11:20] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:11:24] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything,.
[10:11:33] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i am modifying code someone created already
[10:12:01] <Es0teric> i am adding to it so its a mess.. i am putting it on header ready… which is tied to document ready.
[10:12:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p0aphvt8/5/
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> "header ready" doesn't mean anything to me.
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> try an explicit document ready instead.
[10:13:53] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: there was already a value in the input field.. so i put it as a placeholder… wow
[10:14:48] <robertmaxrees> so you were prefilling the field?
[10:16:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i was not.. the person that created it was
[10:20:36] <stormbytes> http://plnkr.co/edit/KH2zEc?p=preview can someone pls look at this and tell me why my animations aren't working as expectd ? (the second time you press the button they screw up, but then they behave normally... werid)
[10:24:14] <Tamwyn> Hey, I'm hardly trying to build a form that is able do load another form with predefined values. Because of this I'm trying to use ajax to push an ID to the php script which returns the values I want to insert in a form later and then insert this form into a div. The problem is: It seems like the jquery code isn't catching the form data and the page is just reloading. Can anyone take a look on my code and tell me what went wrong? I've pushed it to git
[10:26:53] <Tamwyn> The first console.log() is executed when i open the page as expected, but the second one not (visible)
[10:29:49] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric by "you" i meant "the code you're working on" ;)
[10:30:05] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i got it..
[10:30:21] <Es0teric> it started to work now damn the guy that made this shit had no clue what he was doing
[10:44:46] <R13ose> ewz: more thoughts?
[10:53:44] <Marble68> o?
[10:53:44] <Marble68> er.. o/
[10:55:21] <robertmaxrees> hello
[10:55:25] <R13ose> hi
[10:55:36] <R13ose> I am stuck and ewz seems busy who was helping me
[10:56:19] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question R13ose :)
[10:56:19] <R13ose> :D
[10:57:29] <R13ose> When I hover over the big images (background-image(s)), the popup thumbnails come up and I want to take the alt of the big images and put that above the thumbnails. Site: http://ecosanity.org/
[10:58:24] <robertmaxrees> you'll get a lot more help with a fiddle.
[10:58:32] <robertmaxrees> instead of your entire site.
[10:59:21] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I know or I need to explain this better
[10:59:30] <robertmaxrees> i know what you want to do.
[11:00:01] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not going to wade through all of your code to tell you what to put where.
[11:00:03] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: no worries.
[11:00:15] <R13ose> shoky: ping
[11:00:24] <robertmaxrees> R13ose http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ read this for more info.
[11:00:30] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of rude to ping people like that imo.
[11:01:36] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I will read that
[11:02:23] <robertmaxrees> the general gist is that you probably want to add in logic that grabs $(this).prop('alt'); and places that value in the area you want.
[11:03:20] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I already have something setup but I believe this is the hover code I am using.  If you want at the js, it is in slideshow.js
[11:03:38] <robertmaxrees> whereat?
[11:06:15] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: http://ecosanity.org/sites/all/themes/ecoSanity/js/slideshow.js $('.slides a').hover(function(){ } the problem might be that the background images have a z-index of -1.
[11:06:38] <robertmaxrees> erm
[11:06:41] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just fiddle this up?
[11:06:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.
[11:07:09] <robertmaxrees> either way, try a console.log($(this).prop('alt'));
[11:07:09] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[11:08:44] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: what is prop?
[11:08:55] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery prop
[11:08:57] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .prop() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[11:13:00] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: if I am putting this in the .hover function that will never work.
[11:13:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:13:41] <robertmaxrees> sure it will.
[11:14:58] <robertmaxrees> btw you're not using hover correctly.
[11:15:06] <R13ose> oh
[11:15:19] <robertmaxrees> it takes two args, not one.
[11:15:26] <robertmaxrees> the first is for mouseenter, the second for mouseleave.
[11:18:28] <robertmaxrees> you want something like http://fixee.org/paste/2cjld95/
[11:18:48] <robertmaxrees> that should give you a rough idea of what you want to do.
[11:20:35] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I am looking at that
[11:28:47] <wovenhead> How can I use QUnit beforeEach to force a pause between each test while DOM loads?
[11:29:20] <cjohnson> never used either but you could try running your test inside a DOMContentLoaded event?
[11:29:59] <cjohnson> or $(document).ready if jquery is part of the tests
[11:31:02] <wovenhead> yeah that might work
[11:39:12] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: when did prop start to be used?  Like which version of jQuery?
[11:40:22] <NoiseEee> 1.9 or something i think R13ose
[11:40:22] <NoiseEee> but the docs will say
[11:43:32] <jaspertheghost> is it possible out of the box to create a jquery widget without binding it to an element ... how can i init a widget without having to depend on an element
[11:43:49] <robertmaxrees> jaspertheghost you can create a fragment.
[11:44:20] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>some text here</div>'); - creates a fragment that doesn't rely on anything else.
[11:44:42] <jaspertheghost> can i also do var xyz = $.widget_name({}); ...?
[11:44:53] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:44:53] <jaspertheghost> or even without xyz
[11:45:02] <robertmaxrees> depends on what $.widget_name() is doing.
[11:46:33] <jaspertheghost> well if u dont tell it to bind it will sit there and an instance variable stored in options so that later on another widget can include it
[11:47:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:47:57] <jaspertheghost> im creating a widget that will allow other widgets to be drawn in it
[11:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you have to have a reference somewhere to target with those other widgets
[11:50:53] <jaspertheghost> i know ... thats the problem im facing now
[11:51:00] <jaspertheghost> how can i have a jqeury widget without a "target"
[11:51:06] <robertmaxrees> err...
[11:51:08] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[11:51:32] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to return a copy of the widget and store that somewhere.
[11:52:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do this?
[11:54:20] <jaspertheghost> a project...
[11:54:37] <robertmaxrees> you know that doesn't help me very much ;)
[11:54:44] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[11:56:22] <jaspertheghost> im wrapping a visualizaton library into jquery widget factory
[11:56:41] <robertmaxrees> is it your vis library?
[11:57:00] <jaspertheghost> no, but it has 0 documentation ...something for work
[11:57:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd abandon that idea tbh.
[11:57:35] <robertmaxrees> wrapping somebody else's library in the widget factory is going to be a pita and not work it imo.
[11:59:25] <jaspertheghost> i agree but im going to attempt in anways
[11:59:46] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[11:59:56] <robertmaxrees> oookaaaay
[12:08:40] <R13ose> NoiseEee: I am not using that high yet.
[12:09:08] <robertmaxrees> R13ose O.o what 1.6
[12:09:30] <robertmaxrees> that's the version it was introduced.  what version of JQ are you running?
[12:09:59] <R13ose> The CMS is using 1.4.4 which is old I know and can upgrade but don't want to break things.
[12:09:59] <robertmaxrees> O.oi
[12:10:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd put your other stuff on hold and upgrade
[12:10:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to have nothing but problems.
[12:10:28] <robertmaxrees> at least get to 1.9
[12:10:31] <Robdgreat> what's the most comprehensive way to test for breakage on upgrade
[12:10:36] <R13ose> okay
[12:10:45] <robertmaxrees> the jquery migrate plugin will tell you what'll break in that upgrade.
[12:10:50] <Robdgreat> nice
[12:10:56] <Robdgreat> TIL
[12:11:01] <robertmaxrees> R13ose go to the latest in 1.x version.
[12:11:15] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: what if things break?
[12:11:37] <robertmaxrees> R13ose fix them.
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> drop in new file, correct the bugs, then go on.
[12:12:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're fighting against jquery since a lot's happened in the last few years.
[12:12:41] <R13ose> okay
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> 1.4 was released almost exactly 5 years ago :)
[12:43:49] <lborda> hi guys I am trying to make this javascript work but still couldn't get it. the datepicker always stay in the first row when cloning rows... Any clue to what's happening here? http://jsfiddle.net/uoyzbwro/6/
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> that datepicker call only knows about the first one on the page.
[12:47:23] <drakythe> Does anyone know of a slideshow that allows for multiple images of various heighths/widths and arranged in a sort of Metro UI style? My google fu is failing me.
[12:47:54] <robertmaxrees> a carousel or a gallery?
[12:48:08] <drakythe> robertmaxrees: carousel
[12:48:25] <robertmaxrees> carousel then where does the metro part come into play?
[12:48:52] <ruibritopt> I am implementing a web client which uses http basic authentication, meaning that I have to sent the credentials every time I send a request to the server. What is the best way to store the credentials (in the browser) after login? So I can use them whenever I send my requests.
[12:49:03] <drakythe> robertmaxrees: Its the only way I know to describe the kind of tiling I’m after, my words are failing me, which I suspect is why my google fu is also failing.
[12:49:22] <Valduare> hey guys hows it going
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> ruibritopt you don't.
[12:49:53] <robertmaxrees> storing credentials in the browser is a bad idea.
[12:49:56] <robertmaxrees> store a session cookie.
[12:50:18] <lborda> robertmaxrees, yeah I know I need to destroy it but I still couldn't figure out where in the code... how to access it
[12:50:26] <Valduare> i got a question -   how can I tap into another piece of codes event,   ie its a number thats updated when you add something to the cart.     i’d like to tap into when it adds that number and also do a nice transition effect on the cart icon itself.
[12:50:27] <NoiseEee> http://www.drewgreenwell.com/projects/metrojs @ drakythe
[12:51:44] <NoiseEee> http://www.magazinehive.com/2013/09/jquery-metro-ui-plugins/ @ drakythe  (really just googled "jquery metro image gallery")
[12:51:48] <ruibritopt> robertmaxrees: i am a beginner at this thing, but I heard cookies are a bad solution to store credentials?! if I were to use cookies I would read the cookie every time, and if the expiration time had passed I would sent my user to the login page. Is my thought process correct?
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> ruibritopt something like that.
[12:52:42] <drakythe> NoiseEee: Thanks. I’ll take a look at those. The issue is I’m specifically looking for a carousel/slideshow, as opposed to a static gallery. That first one look promising though.
[12:53:27] <Es0teric> ok so on an input field, i have a &nbsp; value in it
[12:53:44] <Es0teric> i want to remove that value on keyup and allow text to be input
[12:53:47] <Es0teric> how would i go about that?
[12:54:23] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:54:24] <drakythe> .val(‘’)? @Es0teric
[12:54:45] <Es0teric> drakythe:  .val(‘’) doesnt allow the text to be displayed.. it always removes the text on keyup
[12:54:46] <Es0teric> so that wouldnt work
[12:54:54] <Es0teric> &nbsp; is a space
[12:55:02] <Es0teric> so i just want to remove the initial space on keyup
[12:55:23] <drakythe> Es0teric: if .val() == &nbsp { .val(‘’) }
[12:55:30] <drakythe> Es0teric: Find a way to if it
[12:56:41] <Es0teric> drakythe: that doesnt work
[12:56:52] <ruibritopt> robertmaxrees: how this still be valid if I (in the future) visit a page and the login is already done. How can I achieve that?
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> ruibritopt do what now?
[12:58:06] <ruibritopt> cjohnson: I sign in, but if I close the page, and return I am still sign in
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> lol you're in two places asking the same question ;)
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1354999/keep-me-logged-in-the-best-approach/17266448#17266448
[12:59:05] <Es0teric> this currently is my problem http://jsfiddle.net/ohfd96uv/
[12:59:19] <drakythe> Es0teric: forgive me, I’m not familiar with the keyup function, have you tried using focus()?
[12:59:30] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric why are you remoive the &nbsp; ?
[12:59:44] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: because its tied to a search param
[12:59:48] <ruibritopt> robertmaxrees: sorry I started there, and found this channel later. It was a way to try getting more opnions
[13:00:05] <drakythe> Es0teric: oh! oh yes, you should probably consider using focus() instead of keyup()
[13:00:08] <Es0teric> drakythe: i want it to disappear when the user starts typing
[13:00:26] <Es0teric> focus would activate when the user clicks on the field
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you have to do it on keydown and only the first time.
[13:01:35] <Es0teric> so then.. keydown then $(this).which == 1 ?
[13:01:41] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:01:53] <BillCriswell> event.which
[13:01:54] <Es0teric> which would be the amount of times it was called right?
[13:02:00] <drakythe> Es0teric: jsfiddle.net/ohfd96uv/1/
[13:02:05] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric why are you looking at the event for text that's already in the box?
[13:03:30] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: tried it.. if(e.which == 1) still doesnt remove it
[13:03:46] <BillCriswell> What are you expecting e.which to be?
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric because text that exists in the box isn't the e.which >.>
[13:04:14] <Es0teric> drakythe: the fiddle did not remove the space
[13:04:19] <reynierpm> hi, I will like to know why in this code http://pastie.org/9816913 the $.get Ajax call (line 40) is executed twice
[13:04:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i understand that
[13:04:33] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: the amount of times the event was called?
[13:04:36] <reynierpm> what I am not seeing there
[13:04:57] <drakythe> Es0teric: ah, I see why. Because if you press a key, then on keyup() the val() no longer equals &nbsp;
[13:04:57] <testsubject004> Is there a sure-fire way of preventing freezing of the UI when using deferred ajax requests?
[13:05:17] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Why would you think that?
[13:05:40] <robertmaxrees> testsubject004 you shouldn't have any UI freezing when using ajax.
[13:05:44] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: e.which is the keynum
[13:05:53] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric of the pressed key
[13:06:07] <Es0teric> yeah i just saw that when i did console.log
[13:06:20] <Es0teric> so i want to check the inital time the key was pressed
[13:06:24] <Es0teric> thats all i really care about
[13:06:28] <Es0teric> and it could be any key
[13:06:31] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:07:23] <Es0teric> and yes, drakythe
[13:08:06] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ohfd96uv/3/
[13:08:08] <drakythe> Es0teric: Does it have to a &nbsp;? It can’t be like “Search” or anything?
[13:09:11] <Es0teric> drakythe: right now the value in the input field is &nbsp;
[13:09:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i see that
[13:09:51] <Es0teric> my question is
[13:10:02] <Es0teric> how do i detect the initial key hit
[13:10:08] <Es0teric> because again, thats all i care about right now
[13:10:50] <Es0teric> once i detect the initial key hit, it will delete the nbsp and the user can continue typing
[13:11:12] <drakythe> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/ohfd96uv/4/ That one works for me
[13:11:20] <drakythe> Es0teric: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8039182/matching-jquery-text-to-nbsp
[13:11:34] <drakythe> Compliments PiTheNumber on stack
[13:11:42] <Es0teric> and we have a winner
[13:11:49] <Es0teric> lol
[13:11:52] <drakythe> Es0teric: needed the proper character
[13:12:28] <Es0teric> drakythe: yeah, thanks
[13:13:59] <Es0teric> ok now a new problem arises
[13:14:17] <Es0teric> if the input is blank with &nbsp; and the enter key is pressed, it removes the &nbsp;
[13:14:18] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees Take a look to this code http://pastie.org/9816913 the $.get Ajax call (line 40) is executed more than once time, I am running the same issues as days before (do not know if you remember) but in this case I can not remove the $.get from inside the $.post request, is there any other way to get ride of that behavior?
[13:14:54] <Es0teric> because the smart ass that built this search form didnt think about putting a submit button
[13:15:17] <Es0teric> and i am not allowed to add extra div elements unless they are cleared
[13:15:22] <drakythe> Es0teric: can you add a check for text and disable the submit on keydown if val() == ‘’?
[13:15:45] <Es0teric> drakythe: i dont want to disable the submit on &nbsp; only
[13:15:53] <Es0teric> i want it to be able to submit on &nbsp;
[13:16:36] <Es0teric> when it submits on &nbsp; the search automatically displays all results (which is the expected result)
[13:17:24] <drakythe> Es0teric: I have no idea, unless you can check on keydown() which key was pressed, and only if the key pressed != ‘enter’ run the additional erasure logic checks...?
[13:18:09] <Es0teric> drakythe: on keydown, i can do an additional keyup right?
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> you can do separate keydown and keyup bindings, yeah.
[13:19:17] <drakythe> Es0teric: This might also help, http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-check-if-an-enter-key-is-pressed-with-jquery/ — its fairly old, but might be helpful
[13:28:39] <Es0teric> drakythe: yeah now its a problem because the keycode now doesnt submit the form
[13:28:54] <drakythe> Es0teric: new fiddle?
[13:31:09] <Es0teric> drakythe http://jsfiddle.net/ohfd96uv/5/
[13:31:12] <Es0teric> that works for me
[13:31:46] <Es0teric> so i am listening for the first keydown that is not the enter key
[13:31:54] <drakythe> Es0teric: yup, looks good to me
[13:31:55] <Es0teric> to delete the value
[13:32:25] <testsubject_492> Is this the best way to deal with multiple async calls within a setTimeout timer? http://pastebin.com/6dZMBqyE
[13:32:38] <Valduare> hey guys I have an event to pop up a panel, then another event to close panel if you click anywhere in the panel…   working well on desktop and touch devices! woohoo    the problem though  I have a shoping cart in this panel and users need to be able to click this X to remove items…. the X is still clickable but it registers and closes the pannel… how can I make the close panel listener NOT effect when user clicks on
[13:32:38] <Valduare> X
[13:32:49] <testsubject_492> as far as the $.when().done() are concerned
[13:33:13] <drakythe> Es0teric: I think, and this is just a nitpick, I would have checked for the keycode first, before comparing the val, because if the keycode is 13 you don’t need to do any further checking.
[13:33:31] <drakythe> Es0teric: instead of checking for the \xa0 character first
[13:34:02] <Es0teric> drakythe: i mean it works either way
[13:34:32] <Es0teric> the end result is the same.. so that wouldnt really matter to me
[13:34:40] <Es0teric> but if something happens, i’ll definitely keep that in mind
[13:34:42] <drakythe> Es0teric: like I said, nitpick :)
[13:35:06] <Valduare> here’s the code (minus the cart inside http://jsfiddle.net/wa1av3bm/9/
[13:35:20] <Valduare> click on the orange shopping cart icon to see the dropdown
[13:39:59] <Valduare> can someone point me in the right direction - Im not even sure what its called to google for :P
[13:43:44] <Valduare> drakythe: can you help me out
[13:44:29] <mbrzuzy> Valduare do you have an event for clicks on the remove item?
[13:44:43] <Valduare> mbrzuzy: http://jsfiddle.net/wa1av3bm/9/  heres a fiddle
[13:44:55] <Valduare> let me dig into the shopping cart to see what its doing
[13:46:54] <mbrzuzy> You will need to stop propagation in the click event of the remove.  Read up on this article though as well, http://css-tricks.com/dangers-stopping-event-propagation/
[13:46:56] <Valduare> k i see this so far 			$cartContents.='<span id="wppizza-cart-'.$k.'" class="wppizza-remove-from-cart" title="'.$txt['remove_from_cart']['lbl'].'">x</span>';
[13:49:42] <Valduare> so I somehow need to wrap my mouseup  event in something for the id of the remove cart items?
[13:50:03] <Valduare> ie if the click is within class .wppizza-remove-from-cart then dont fire mouseup event
[13:50:19] <Valduare> otherwise anywhere else then fire the mouseup event?
[13:52:20] <mbrzuzy> it just means don't propagate it, it still fires on the remove
[13:52:32] <mbrzuzy> it just doesn't keep firing it
[13:55:11] <Valduare> so on my fiddle lines 6-8 in the js window
[13:56:10] <Valduare> that needs to be wrapped in something that looks for the click within wppizza-remove-from-cart class and dosnt fire the mouseup   slideup trigger   otherwise clicking anywhere else on that show-quickcart-zone will allow it to slide up
[14:00:27] <mbrzuzy> No Valduare
[14:00:27] <Valduare> i’ve been reading through the article but dosnt sound like what I need?
[14:00:43] <mbrzuzy> Do you understand the concept of propagation?
[14:01:19] <Valduare> no
[14:01:26] <dglambert> Hey I am trying to grab the text inside an element
[14:01:27] <Valduare> im very new at this
[14:01:45] <dglambert> <a>foo<sup>blah<sup></a>
[14:01:54] <mbrzuzy> In a nutshell, since wppizza-remove-from-cart is inside quick_cart_zone.  When you click remove cart, the mouseup event fires twice.  Because remove cart is inside quick_cart_zone
[14:02:03] <dglambert> foo, but not the <sup> tag
[14:02:05] <mbrzuzy> first it fires on remove_cart, then it fires again on cart_zone
[14:02:37] <mbrzuzy> you you need to add $('.wppizza-remove-from-cart').on('mouseup', function (event) {event.stopPropagation(); });
[14:02:54] <mbrzuzy> so when it fires on remove cart, it wont fire on cart_zone
[14:03:09] <mbrzuzy> and $(#quickcart').slideUp() wont run
[14:03:22] <Valduare> ah
[14:03:26] <dglambert> nevermind got it
[14:03:33] <dglambert> $()
[14:03:34] <Valduare> i cant wait till I can figure this stuff out like you guys can
[14:03:37] <mbrzuzy> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[14:03:48] <mbrzuzy> and http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing
[14:03:52] <mbrzuzy> skim through those
[14:03:55] <dglambert> $('a')[0].firstChild.data
[14:04:09] <machty> is there some historical reason the method is called .val() rather than .value()?
[14:06:56] <decx> like i'm gonna write 2 extra cha
[14:07:33] <Valduare> mbrzuzy: I was just testing it out - it works only the first time after you refresh the page
[14:07:46] <BillCriswell> decx: Understo
[14:07:55] <mbrzuzy> Valduare, can you show me your updated snippet
[14:08:01] <mbrzuzy> fiddle*
[14:08:04] <decx> i've been setting up my new pc all day
[14:08:05] <Valduare> ya one moment
[14:08:13] <decx> i can attach 6 screens but only have 5
[14:08:16] <decx> -.-
[14:08:17] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah you've been awfully quiet.
[14:08:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Well that makes you way less manly in my opinion.
[14:08:39] <decx> oh well happy new year then i guess
[14:08:57] <BillCriswell> happy year!
[14:08:58] <Valduare> mbrzuzy: http://jsfiddle.net/wa1av3bm/10/  wont do anything in the fiddle cause I dont have the entire cart code running in there
[14:11:12] <mbrzuzy> Valduare, this may be because the items aren't bound yet, so try this method: $('#show-quick-cart-zone').on('mouseup', '.wppizza-remove-from-cart', function (event) {event.stopPropagation()});
[14:11:31] <Valduare> ok ty
[14:11:33] <Valduare> one moment
[14:11:54] <mbrzuzy> Sorry, I meant if the items are added dynamically after page load, your event won't be bound
[14:12:08] <Valduare> appears to be working
[14:12:16] <Valduare> ty so much!
[14:12:29] <mbrzuzy> No problem
[14:12:57] <Valduare> sometimes people with code is like watching a piano player in concert :P
[14:14:15] <mbrzuzy> It just takes practice.  The key is to try and understand everything you're doing the first time, so when you continue to use the same techniques, you realize why you're using them and how they work
[14:14:43] <Valduare> ya - it helps to to have friends who are coders to learn from.
[14:15:25] <Valduare> lonley road with just google and irc for help somet times :P
[14:15:29] <Valduare> I appreciate your time.
[14:15:34] <mbrzuzy> Always glad to help
[14:16:00] <Tamwyn> Hey, I'm hardly trying to build a form that is able do load another form with predefined values. Because of this I'm trying to use ajax to push an ID to the php script which returns the values I want to insert in a form later and then insert this form into a div. The problem is: It seems like the jquery code isn't catching the form data and the page is just reloading. Can anyone take a look on my code and tell me what went wrong? I've pushed it to git
[14:17:39] <Tamwyn> At the moment there are just afew lines trying to catch the submit
[14:18:17] <mbrzuzy> I can take a look, can you post a fiddle
[14:18:49] <NoiseEee> Tamwyn: are you stopping the event?
[14:19:36] <Es0teric> when using multiple instances of a class elements lets say, how do you use the currently selected one? isnt it $(‘.someClass’, $(this)) ?
[14:20:05] <BinaryKitten> .not(this)
[14:20:19] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: what does 'currently selected' mean?
[14:20:27] <BinaryKitten> NoiseEee - good Q
[14:20:41] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: the element selected on the event
[14:20:49] <BinaryKitten> this
[14:21:04] <Es0teric> BinaryKitten: so then $(‘.someClass’, this) ?
[14:21:08] <Tamwyn> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=4x8slp2hgH
[14:21:20] <BinaryKitten> that's items with someClass inside this
[14:21:30] <NoiseEee> $('.someClass').on(someEvent,function() { //within here, "this" is the item that fired the event})
[14:21:56] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: my problem is that this is on a submit event so the submit event is targeting the form element
[14:22:39] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: right, forms submit. so whats the problem exactly
[14:23:26] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/1q5zpf6s
[14:23:33] <BinaryKitten> Es0teric you want to know what triggered the submit/
[14:23:35] <BinaryKitten> ?
[14:23:45] <Es0teric> BinaryKitten: no because that class is in two different places
[14:23:48] <Es0teric> line 3
[14:24:02] <BinaryKitten> Oh..
[14:24:14] <BinaryKitten> you want to check the form input inside the form that's being submitted
[14:24:24] <Es0teric> BinaryKitten: exactly
[14:24:35] <BinaryKitten> var email = $(this).find'.newsletter-email')
[14:24:52] <BinaryKitten> var email = $(this).find(.newsletter-email');  sorry
[14:25:01] <Es0teric> BinaryKitten: eventhough there are two .newsletter-form’s too?
[14:25:13] <BinaryKitten> or as you had it ... $('.newsletter-email', this)
[14:25:35] <BinaryKitten> Es0teric the event triggers, there's 1 element it's being triggered on
[14:25:42] <Es0teric> BinaryKitten: right ok
[14:25:52] <BinaryKitten> the this represents 1 item within events
[14:27:16] <laphlaw> I'm seeing an issue where I make an ajax network request, and its giving me "SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unexpected EOF". What's strange is that I get this error before the server is finished doing the processing... almost as if ajax is giving up "too early"
[14:27:37] <reynierpm> hi there guys can I get some help, tips, clue around this topic on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27808312/execute-code-before-item-gets-removed-in-bootstrap-tagsinput-cause-too-many-unne
[14:27:39] <reynierpm> ?
[14:28:09] <laphlaw> Inspecting it in the web browser, the response body is indeed empty, which the error makes sense.. however, what I can't understand is why its giving up before the server has responded
[14:33:10] <laphlaw> any ideas?
[14:34:16] <Tamwyn> NoiseEee_: I have a prevent.Default in the end of the Script.
[14:34:43] <Tamwyn> Maybe i should let it sleep before i execute the ajax code
[14:38:18] <Tamwyn> I think something is going wrong while I try to catch the submit
[15:58:11] <robertmaxrees> lol javascript.
[16:01:33] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I have some code in my beforeSend on my ajax request that adds a "LOADING" message but it doesn't go away after send (on success)... I can't find ANY info about this being a normal occurance. Am I missing something?
[16:02:04] <LindsayMac> nevermind! Answered my own question. Derp
[17:56:17] <reynierpm> it is possible to access data from a .done callback in a nested call? see this topic at SO
[17:57:38] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm depends.  share your code?
[17:58:08] <reynierpm> here robertmaxrees http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27810192/access-data-parameter-in-a-nested-call I open a topic on SO
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> you're not understanding the problem :)
[17:59:53] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees which problem?
[18:00:33] <robertmaxrees> that .on() call should be able to access the data object just fine.
[18:01:03] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that event isn't happening before the callback has completed?
[18:01:15] <reynierpm> the second $.get?
[18:01:26] <robertmaxrees> the .on()
[18:01:30] <robertmaxrees> }).on('select2-removing', function(ev) {
[18:02:22] <reynierpm> no, should not happening
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any console errors?
[18:02:41] <robertmaxrees> what's telling you that this code isn't working?
[18:02:48] <reynierpm> the first executed is the main $.get where data comes from
[18:02:57] <reynierpm> dspid is not send in the second $.get request
[18:03:41] <robertmaxrees> try putting console.log(data.idDistribuidorProductoSolicitud); before that second $.get() call.
[18:03:54] <reynierpm> waits
[18:05:53] <reynierpm> I got undefined
[18:06:10] <reynierpm> ups waits a minute
[18:06:22] <reynierpm> I think I mess up here with var
[18:06:31] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/y9y8zn7/
[18:06:32] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[18:06:36] <robertmaxrees> see that console.log() ?
[18:07:23] <reynierpm> yes, waits, I mess somewhere with var values
[18:07:34] <reynierpm> did not pay attention to what it comes from JSON
[18:07:45] <reynierpm> and that, I think, is where problem is
[18:07:52] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[18:08:52] <reynierpm> yeah, that was the problem
[18:08:52] <reynierpm> thanks anyway
[18:09:03] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[18:09:22] <robertmaxrees> make sure you close that SO post btw
[18:10:36] <reynierpm> I delete the post

[21:02:05] <delinquentme> I've got some coded functionality which happens on changing between elements of a dropdown
[21:02:15] <delinquentme> I want to trigger that element change in the dropdown using jquery
[21:02:16] <delinquentme> how do ?
[21:05:15] <beefKitten1> delinquenteme: erm, what? code?
[21:27:26] <GoSox> if there is a server error, how long it $.post( )'s timeout before .fail( ) is called?
[21:29:51] <GoSox> argh according to stackoverflow, they don't timeout
[21:30:59] <systemfault> IIRC, jQuery's ajax supports timeouts... so you could add one.
[21:31:12] <GoSox> yup
[21:31:25] <GoSox> i would have thought $.post and $.get would have some kind of default timeout
[22:11:55] <t100> Hi #jquery
[22:12:13] <t100> I'm using jQuery Mobile (& PhoneGap.)
[22:12:27] <t100> and am facing issues when we deploy the application on devices (iPad)
[22:13:35] <t100> the show is that the when I do $.mobile.changePage(id, {transition: 'slide'}); it is very slow
[22:14:04] <t100> on pages where there arer afew images ( 4 < few < 15
[22:14:07] <t100> )
[22:14:26] <t100> how do I debug the issue, what is causing the slowness?
[22:15:59] <ceterizine> So with the common .animate({ left: ... }, n)
[22:16:32] <ceterizine> I'd like to figure out a way to make the attribute dynamic if possible
[22:46:51] <t100> Hi #jquery, I'm using jQuery mobile & have a single HTML file with multiple pages in it. The issue we are facing is that when we do .changePage(id, {transition: 'slide'}) the transition lags and it is slow and there is a delay.
[22:47:37] <t100> This usually happens when we change to a page where there are images (about 8 to 12) all around 300 x 300 and about 100 to 200 KBs
[22:47:45] <t100> What could be the issue and how do I debug it?
[22:48:11] <t100> It only happens when we ran the app on iPad (on browser one cannot feel much difference.)
