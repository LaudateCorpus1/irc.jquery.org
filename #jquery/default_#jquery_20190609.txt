[05:22:10] <vile> Can someone take a look at this fiddle please and tell me why a class selector isn't triggering on click? http://jsfiddle.net/kxwqon6m/1/
[05:23:02] <vile> I don't know if I have the terminology right as I've only started with jquery recently, so apologies for my ignorance.
[05:50:57] <cubud> I can't make sense of the Google answers, can anyone help me with the error `Assignment to read-only properties is not allowed in strict mode` https://hatebin.com/laowaahbvz
[06:14:21] <vile> Well, I got it to do what I wanted. Any tips for optimizing or alternative ways to achieve this? (Please don't tell me it's a one-liner *facepalm*). http://jsfiddle.net/kxwqon6m/4/
[19:31:55] <MeltedRolo> Hi, am I in the right place for help converting a javascript file into pure jquery?
[19:33:48] <MeltedRolo> anybody out there?
[19:35:04] <MeltedRolo> i cant get an event.target to match a jquery selector, can anybody help?
[19:38:12] <shoky> MeltedRolo: just ask your question. ideally with an accompanying jsfiddle/testcase
[19:40:09] <MeltedRolo> How can I rewrite the following in JQuery ... var blog_button = document.getElementById("blog_drop_button"); and later accessing it with this if(target === blog_button.firstElementChild) {
[19:41:13] <MeltedRolo> ithe script works perfectly but i cant get event and the jquery selector to match
[19:43:16] <shoky> var blog_button = $('#blog_drop_button');    blog_button.children().first().is(event.target)
[19:43:49] <MeltedRolo> ahhhh ok i,ll try it thanks very much
[19:53:39] <MeltedRolo> no, that doesnt work
[20:03:10] <MeltedRolo> it seems that blog_button.children().first() is returning an object and not an element
[20:19:42] <shoky> MeltedRolo: yes, it returns a jquery object, which you can call .is() on
[20:20:15] <MeltedRolo> yeah wasn't working
[20:20:23] <MeltedRolo> got it sorted now though
[20:20:25] <shoky> you can access the element with [0] like in an array
[20:20:36] <MeltedRolo> thats exactly what i did
[20:20:45] <MeltedRolo> thanks for the help, appreciated
