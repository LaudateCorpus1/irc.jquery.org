[06:37:15] <sgs> Hi. I have a question about selectors and performance. What will be the best way to go through all div-elements containing the classes: "foo" (very common) and "bar" (very rare)? $("div.foo").each(function() { ... then $(this).hasClass("bar")  .... the opposite.. or is it possible to make a selection based on two classes?
[06:38:50] <sgs> *then if ($(this).hasClass("bar")) ....
[06:39:40] <AdamPDotty> like $('div.foo.bar') ?
[06:41:59] <sgs> AdamPDotty: I guess what I am trying to ask is, is there a performance difference between $('div.foo.bar'), $('div.bar.foo') and ($('div.bar') then if $(this).hasClass("foo")) , etc.? Not familiar with jQuery internals.
[06:43:08] <sgs> assuming that most elements in the DOM has "foo" and only very few "bar".
[06:43:14] <sgs> *have
[07:10:47] <Cork> sgs: .hasClass is not a selector
[07:10:52] <Cork> it is a string comparison
[07:11:06] <Cork> it does element.className.split(" ")
[07:11:15] <Cork> and checks if the string is in there
[07:12:06] <AdamPDotty> Would still have the same effect when wrapped in a for loop and an if.
[07:12:10] <Cork> for the selectors, the order of the class doesn't matter; and adding another class does close to no difference in speed
[07:12:23] <AdamPDotty> But I doubt, that is a sensible scheme.
[07:13:05] <Cork> what is the best performant depends on how the dom looks
[07:13:17] <Cork> if you have a ton of dom elements selecting in it can be slow
[07:13:32] <Cork> in those cases the loop is faster
[07:24:24] <sgs> Cork: Thanks! :)
[09:59:19] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/313752/
[09:59:32] <Caspan> having some issues with selecting cells
[09:59:49] <Caspan> so when you hold ctrl down and click you can click on multi items and unclick multi items
[10:00:07] <Caspan> but when i signgle click i can get it to toggle the selected class
[10:00:12] <Caspan> i am not sure what I am doign wrong
[10:00:26] <Caspan> so CTRL + Click works exactly as expected
[10:00:44] <Caspan> if you click on children it will unslect and parents.. etc
[10:01:12] <Cork> so line 44 is failing?
[10:01:39] <Caspan> it works fore verythign else though
[10:01:42] <Caspan> it is working
[10:01:47] <Caspan> just not when i do a single click
[10:01:54] <Cork> if you disable ToggleButtons(); it works
[10:01:59] <Cork> so the problem is in ToggleButtons();
[10:02:17] <Caspan> sorry
[10:02:20] <Caspan> that shoudl not be in there
[10:02:21] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/313752/
[10:02:41] <Cork> ya, it still is
[10:02:45] <Caspan> click on any row and it will select it then click on it again and i want to unselect it
[10:02:59] <Cork> the problem is in ToggleButtons()
[10:03:04] <Cork> line 47
[10:03:14] <Caspan> i have removed that form the code
[10:03:20] <Cork> no
[10:03:31] <Caspan> no??
[10:03:38] <Caspan> LOL
[10:03:58] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/313791/
[10:04:01] <Caspan> there use this insted
[10:04:07] <Caspan> no extra code in there
[10:05:25] <Cork> something is removing the class from the row before line 44
[10:05:30] <Cork> so it can't toggle
[10:06:00] <Caspan> when you single click line 30-32 is executed
[10:06:14] <Caspan> which is go get all the selected items an unselect them
[10:06:34] <Caspan> sorry get all selected items that are not this item and unselect it
[10:06:45] <Caspan> thne toggle select on this element
[10:06:47] <Cork> 30-32 is } // End of if
[10:07:15] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/313804/
[10:07:19] <Caspan> look at that code please
[10:07:28] <Caspan> i have removed code that no longer needs to be there
[10:08:12] <Caspan> i think i know
[10:08:18] <Caspan> the not is not selecting the right element
[10:10:37] <Caspan> NM got it to work!!
[10:10:49] <Caspan> no not selector was not selecting the right child item
[10:10:54] <Caspan> sorry
[10:11:22] <Caspan> now to add shift click...
[10:11:24] <Caspan> LOL
[10:11:43] <Caspan> is there  a way to say get all these Items ebetween these two items?
[10:12:10] <Caspan> i know that is a far ask!!
[10:12:17] <Caspan> just curious
[10:13:23] <Caspan> .nextUntil() looks liek it might work
[10:20:47] <ychaouche> hello #jquery
[10:21:20] <ychaouche> I need to find specific DOM nodes where the data-id attribute is equal to one of the values present in an array : https://gist.github.com/ychaouche/57dda213ce3df01bf64e720419560bca
[10:21:23] <ychaouche> how can I do that ?
[10:22:19] <ychaouche> i.e, I want to do this : $("#id").find("dl[state-id]='name'") but for multiple values of state-id, not just one.
[10:23:16] <Cork> $('[data-id="' + arr.join('"],[data-id="') + '"]')
[10:23:32] <Cork> that is how you can select that
[10:24:08] <ychaouche> I'm lost in the quotes
[10:24:09] <Cork> replace $ with .find if you need it on a sub dom tree
[10:24:22] <Cork> it just builds a comma separated query string
[10:25:03] <ychaouche> how would the string look like if I had to write it manually ?
[10:25:24] <Cork> '[data-id="id1"],[data-id="id2"]'
[10:25:31] <ychaouche> oh ok
[10:25:46] <ychaouche> cool
[10:26:38] <Cork> alternatively you can do something like $('[data-id]').filter(function() { return arr.includes($(this).data('id')); })
[10:26:49] <ychaouche> that looks even better
[10:26:53] <ychaouche> and more readable
[10:26:54] <Cork> but if you have a lot of elements with data-id not in the array it will be a lot slower
[10:27:05] <ychaouche> because of the function calls ?
[10:27:14] <Cork> cause it selects all elements with data-id
[10:27:18] <Cork> and then filters the result
[10:27:34] <ychaouche> I have more than 80 but less than 100 of those
[10:27:44] <ychaouche> I need to filter out about 20 of them
[10:27:57] <ychaouche> so 60 of them would be not in the filter
[12:23:21] <subleq> Is there a file I can load after loading jquery slim to upgrade it to full? Most of my pages only use slim except for one
[12:25:02] <shoky_> yep it's called jquery :p
[13:08:44] <pippuccio76> Hi , sorry for english , there is a way to write in search field by press a button ? http://jsfiddle.net/ebRXw/5596/
[13:09:07] <pippuccio76> sorry datatablesplugin
[13:10:11] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ebRXw/5598/  you were missing the 'k' on your 'click'
[13:11:20] <pippuccio76> Tanks taplar , but how write a value in search field and searching the value ?
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 you want to set the value of the search box.
[13:11:38] <taplar> well, so lets break your issue down
[13:11:46] <taplar> first off, what search field?
[13:12:11] <pippuccio76> the search field of datatable
[13:12:27] <taplar> ok, how can you reference that field?
[13:13:23] <pippuccio76> i dont know , the field appear when you load a datatable
[13:13:40] <taplar> so right click on the element, and inspect it
[13:14:00] <taplar> look for any id or classes it has.  also look at any ids or classes it's parent elements have
[13:14:16] <taplar> this can help you find a selector that will let you target the element
[13:14:17] <pippuccio76> <input type="search" class="" placeholder="" aria-controls="example">
[13:14:40] <pippuccio76> ther'isnt  id or class
[13:14:50] <taplar> what about an id or class on it's close parents
[13:14:52] <taplar> ?
[13:22:51] * taplar whistles
[13:22:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:22:58] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:27:02] <pippuccio76> i dont understand
[13:27:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to be able to find that input.
[13:28:14] <robertmaxrees> the smart way would be to select it through a parent that's unique in some way
[13:37:59] <pippuccio76> this work : http://jsfiddle.net/w7x925gb/
[13:39:43] <taplar_meeting> cool
[23:29:09] <ioerror88> Any recommendations for a html5 terminal (such as josh.js or tilda - the quake console thing)? I'm working on a BBS-like interface to a web site, just for laughs with some friends... We've already made a nice fairly realistic dialup  simulation as the login page.
[23:54:44] <hellyeah> anyone around
[23:55:49] <hellyeah> it worked fine https://jsfiddle.net/er8qsw27/170/ but when i include jquery behaivour is weird https://jsfiddle.net/er8qsw27/172/ why is that?
