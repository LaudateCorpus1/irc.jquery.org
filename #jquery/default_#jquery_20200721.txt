[11:49:42] <Zachary> Hello, how to use draggable(helper: "clone") ? Where to set clone area?
[11:52:35] <Zachary> http://jsfiddle.net/mdfw7nx1/
[11:53:09] <Zachary> I made 2 image dragable but dunno how to clone them
[12:38:47] <robertmaxrees> Zachary so you're just wondering how to set "clone" when initializing the draggable?
[12:40:57] <robertmaxrees> Zachary if so, then http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lgw9fxq4/5/
[15:04:40] <AcTiVaTe> Hi all, I have an event listener on field of radio buttons. However, the listener disappears after an XHR. Do I perhaps just have a function in a wrong place?
[15:04:56] <robertmaxrees> AcTiVaTe no clue - can you show the code?
[15:08:08] <AcTiVaTe> robertmaxrees, https://hastebin.com/ezurocofup.js After page load it is working but as soon as I update cart quantities and an XHR is fired the event vanishes from the DOM.
[15:08:47] <robertmaxrees> what's the ajax code doing?
[15:08:56] <robertmaxrees> also - the event still fires, the listener is what would disappear.
[15:09:26] <AcTiVaTe> it's the custom WooCommerce update cart code.
[15:09:33] <AcTiVaTe> Well custom, standard
[15:09:46] <robertmaxrees> okay, then sounds like the element you're binding to is getting replaced.
[15:10:02] <robertmaxrees> you likely need to use a delegated listener instead.
[15:11:23] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events have more information how the what, why, and how AcTiVaTe
[15:12:45] <AcTiVaTe> Thanks for the advice robertmaxrees :)
[15:18:20] <robertmaxrees> def!  what we're here for :)
[16:00:53] <pat14> In an ajax request, I'm using beforeSend to load a div, then on complete, hiding the div. If the request completes too quickly, the division won't hide. Is there a way I can wait for it to fully be shown, then try to hide it?
[16:01:19] <pat14> I feel like it's attempting to hide the division before it's actually been shown.
[16:01:29] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code?
[16:02:12] <robertmaxrees> when you say "load a div", I wonder what that actually means :)
[16:03:10] <pat14> $("myDiv").slideDown(250, function() { ... .fadeIn(250) ...)});
[16:03:19] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[16:03:24] <robertmaxrees> you're using animations.
[16:03:29] <pat14> yeah
[16:03:40] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:04:06] <robertmaxrees> need to add the hide to the animation queue, if memory serves.
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[16:04:35] <pat14> I'll look into that. Thank you.
[16:04:47] <robertmaxrees> also: beforeSend is really intended for modifying the request itself.
[16:04:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd just stick your code before the ajax call instead :)
[16:05:22] <pat14> Ah ok. That makes sense.
[16:41:43] <audioburn> anyone hiring?
[16:42:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd check on job boards and the like, audioburn
[16:42:49] <audioburn> wow i wish i would have thought of that
[16:43:26] <robertmaxrees> woah heh alright :)
[17:14:38] <adasr3> hey guys, lets say I do following $('.button').click(â€¦) and somewhere in code I create a new .button
[17:14:57] <adasr3> what will be best way to attach the same event to new button?
[17:14:59] <robertmaxrees> adasr3 you need to use a delegated event listener instead :)
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> adasr3 https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events have more information how the what, why, and how
[17:16:03] <paule32> hello
[17:16:22] <paule32> i have a problem  with jquery.js
[17:16:23] <adasr3> thanks let me check
[17:16:24] <paule32> https://dpaste.com/BVYT23TJF
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> paule32 can you show your code that triggers the bug?
[17:17:49] <paule32> it is in jquery.js
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:18:07] <robertmaxrees> so just including jquery.js on the page causes the error?
[17:18:14] <paule32> v3.5.1
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> so just including jquery.js on the page causes the error?
[17:18:54] <paule32> yes
[17:19:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qnwz4mgy/
[17:19:17] <robertmaxrees> can't replicate here :shrug:
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> paule32 can you provide the code you're using that causes the bug?
[17:19:53] <paule32> yes, moment
[17:20:18] <adasr3> robertmaxrees  does this mean that delegated only works under one subtree $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a", function( event ) , can I do this $( "body" ).on( "click", ".action", function( event )
[17:20:49] <adasr3> ".button" is not under single parent
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> adasr3 effectively, yes.  but you want to be careful attaching to, say, body since that then checks each click event to see if it matches criteria.
[17:21:37] <robertmaxrees> are you adding these buttons are apart of some kind of widget?
[17:22:46] <adasr3> I have large edit page
[17:23:00] <robertmaxrees> lol sooo....
[17:23:01] <robertmaxrees> are you adding these buttons are apart of some kind of widget?
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> (trying to see if maybe you want to handle this differently :)
[17:23:15] <adasr3> widget like external page inlcudes it
[17:23:15] <adasr3> ?
[17:23:37] <adasr3> if that you mean, nope single admin page
[17:23:38] <paule32> robertmaxrees: http://www.kallup.net/tmp/jquery.js
[17:23:41] <adasr3> stand alone
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> widget/component, rather.
[17:24:19] <robertmaxrees> paule32 that... doesn't prove anything...?
[17:24:46] <adasr3> "Widget Factory" from jQuery ui?
[17:24:46] <paule32> robertmaxrees: wut?
[17:24:59] <robertmaxrees> adasr3 no - nevermind.
[17:25:03] <adasr3> :) sorry
[17:25:10] <robertmaxrees> adasr3 was trying to figure out the context for these buttons, that's all.
[17:25:19] <robertmaxrees> paule32 you linked me top a copy of jquery 3.5.1
[17:25:38] <robertmaxrees> paule32 that doesn't reproduce the bug?
[17:25:52] <adasr3> so I have this. I have page with products, each product has block of attribues. attributes can be added, removed, updated
[17:27:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you'll want to get some kind of frontend framework to manage those components instead.  can be a lot of work to get there though adasr3
[17:28:54] <adasr3> it is using bootstrap, can not make too big changes. admin side has too much stuff out of the scope of given me task
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah def, just saying that questions like yours usually mean that you should consider getting a framework involved to help eventually :)  not saying you should do that right now haha.
[17:30:35] <adasr3> :D Hey adasr3 I thought this was small task, why is it takes 1 month
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> paule32 fwiw people write code all the time that causes jquery to throw errors that happen "inside" jquery.  that's the issue.
[17:33:24] <paule32> hmm plain file, no error
[17:33:44] <robertmaxrees> paule32 lol that link is just the file - it's not to throw an error.
[17:33:58] <robertmaxrees> paule32 can you share your code that reproduces the error?
[17:34:21] <paule32> strange
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> ??
[17:34:35] <paule32> the issue is in the deep
[17:34:48] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting the error?
[17:35:02] <paule32> moment
[17:35:04] <robertmaxrees> i genuinely can't tell if you're trolling right now lol
[17:35:29] <paule32> that is not my intention
[17:36:06] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:48:20] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://www.kallup.net/
[17:48:27] <paule32> press "Bitte lesen"
[17:48:41] <robertmaxrees> uh..
[17:48:43] <paule32> and show on firefox console
[17:48:57] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/5HDgTvO.png
[17:49:01] <robertmaxrees> https doesn't work.
[17:49:20] <paule32> https://www.kallup.net/
[17:49:24] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:49:28] <robertmaxrees> https doesn't work.
[17:49:38] <paule32> F5 ?
[17:49:39] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/ObtKVnB.png
[17:49:58] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just share the relevant JS and HTML in a fiddle or something?
[17:50:01] <paule32> ah, yes, the self signed cert
[17:50:18] <paule32> have to do reactivate ssl at lets encrypt
[17:50:43] <robertmaxrees> an isolated test case would be much, much better :)
[17:50:49] <paule32> it is to big
[17:51:03] <paule32> no scetch
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> 'kay....
[18:00:55] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://imgur.com/5bw1Sec
[18:01:18] <robertmaxrees> that isn't helpful.
[18:01:33] <paule32> the right bottom yellow box
[18:01:34] <robertmaxrees> where's your code?
[18:02:19] <paule32> you wan't the complete ?
[18:02:30] <paule32> then i have to package a big zip
[18:03:00] <robertmaxrees> just the specific JS you have that causes the bug...
[18:15:53] <paule32> i have 2 blobs
[18:16:00] <paule32> with unknown source
[18:16:18] <paule32> what are blobs ?
[18:16:24] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[18:17:03] <paule32> i am to tired, have to go to bed, sorry, for patient
[18:17:39] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[18:34:57] <robertmaxrees> lol the issue isn't even jquery or easyui.  just bad copies of files lol
[20:19:30] <Phruis> does anyone know of a "tutorial" mode library
[20:20:17] <robertmaxrees> there are a few out there.  can'
[20:20:29] <robertmaxrees> *can't remember any other than intro.js though.
[20:21:16] <robertmaxrees> Phruis
[20:50:51] <Phruis> robertmaxrees better then i could find by googling thanks
[20:51:13] <Phruis> or duckduckgoing
[20:51:16] <Phruis> haha
[20:51:26] <robertmaxrees> sure :)
