[00:10:15] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:14:09] <anli_> I use $(window).resize(func) to detect window size changes, the $(window).width() is 466 to start with, the resize handler is not called initially, only when I resize the window and if I resize the width a pixel, the handler has added 20 pixels to the width, as wide as you would suspect the scrollbar is... any ideas?
[00:15:16] <fabioportieri> anli_: you could check if scrollbar is visible or not
[00:15:30] <anli_> I never hide it
[00:15:40] <anli_> And how do I know then how wide the sb is?
[00:15:48] <anli_> eh, maybe width()? :)
[00:16:50] <anli_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18777338/jquery-resize-ignoring-scrollbars-width , I read that $(window).width is the way to get the size of the window regardless of scrollbars, what "regardless" means
[00:18:47] <anli_> Looking if $('body').innerWidth(); is making me happier

[01:23:18] <Amnesia> fella5s: I'm not asking to ask^^
[01:23:41] <fabioportieri> what's the issue?
[01:23:55] <fella5s> yeah, that's what i was wondering
[01:24:03] <Amnesia> well, apart from the fact that the js doesn't seem to be executed in the jsfiddle example
[01:24:21] <Amnesia> my page isn't being submitted when the "save button" is being pressed on a "cloned" row
[01:24:28] <Amnesia> s/row/table row
[01:25:37] <morfin> hello
[01:25:41] <Cork> Amnesia: TypeError: rowID is undefined
[01:25:43] <Amnesia> the submit buttons do work on the table rows that're are already there (e.g. the ones that weren't added to the table using js)
[01:25:51] <fella5s> you should use something like $(".container").on("click", ".class", function(...
[01:25:51] <Cork> Amnesia: there is no id on the tr
[01:26:09] <Amnesia> woops
[01:26:10] <Amnesia> ty
[01:26:11] <Cork> Amnesia: did't we help you with this a few days ago?
[01:26:26] <Cork> where we removed the dependency on ids?
[01:26:38] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/Cgewj/6/ I've updated it
[01:26:52] <Amnesia> Cork: well, I succeeded to get the cloning part working
[01:27:06] <Amnesia> but the submit button now isn't working on the cloned row
[01:27:16] <Cork> Amnesia: ya, cause you add the event listener to the element
[01:27:21] <Cork> instead of delegating it
[01:27:24] <Cork> we talked about this
[01:27:48] <Amnesia> hm, do you perhaps have some additional reading on the background of the problem??
[01:28:07] <Amnesia> I know it's most likely a rtfm issue, but I somehow need to find the correct manual^^
[01:28:10] <Cork> you where on jquery 1.4 right?
[01:28:13] <Amnesia> 1.5
[01:28:20] <Cork> ?api delegate
[01:28:20] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:28:26] <Amnesia> *click*
[01:28:56] <Amnesia> what's an event in js's context?
[01:29:11] <Cork> Amnesia: it is something the browser emits
[01:29:11] <Amnesia> user interaction on buttons/forms?
[01:29:14] <Cork> based on user action
[01:29:17] <Amnesia> hm ok
[01:29:46] <Cork> like "clicking", "typing", "moving cursor", "moving focus" and so on
[01:30:07] <Cork> aka. click, keyup, mousemove, focus/blur
[01:30:43] <Amnesia> " Amnesia: ya, cause you add the event listener to the element "
[01:30:51] <Amnesia> so basically js keeps waiting for input from the button?
[01:30:58] <Cork> no
[01:31:06] <abishek> i want to disable the default form submission when enter key is pressed, how can i do that?
[01:31:07] <Cork> when you clone the element you create a new set
[01:31:18] <Cork> but the event handlers are added on the old elements
[01:31:28] <Cork> instead you add one event handler on a parent
[01:31:28] <fabioportieri> abishek: e.preventDefault() should do it
[01:31:36] <Cork> and then listen for the event bubbling up from the target
[01:31:51] <abishek> fabioportieri, for which event should I be doing this?
[01:32:05] <fabioportieri> abishek: for the submit event
[01:32:13] <Cork> Amnesia: events is a form of callbacks, but the call comes from the browser core not js
[01:32:32] <Amnesia> ok
[01:33:35] <Amnesia> and an "element" is mainly a dom element right? e.g. a button, input field etc
[01:33:39] <morfin> is there way if some event handler was binded or not?
[01:34:02] <morfin> i want to create plugin which shows select(multiple rows) when link is clicked
[01:34:03] <Cork> Amnesia: it is always a dom element
[01:34:28] <morfin> and i need to bind to * event which will close my dialog with that select
[01:34:37] <Cork> morfin: not natively from the browser, not officially in jquery
[01:34:51] <morfin> hmm
[01:34:52] <Cork> but there is an internal array that holds the listeners jquery has bound
[01:35:03] <morfin> not good
[01:35:08] <Cork> but it isn't a public api
[01:35:14] <Cork> so you can use it on your own risk
[01:35:14] <morfin> i suspected that
[01:35:20] <Cork> but a new version of jquery might break this
[01:35:27] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[01:35:31] <morfin> that's why i want to avoid that
[01:35:38] <Cork> then there isn't any
[01:35:46] <Cork> the browsers doesn't provide a way to ask for this
[01:36:02] <abishek> fabioportieri, how can i trigger a button click event when enter is pressed on a form?
[01:36:04] <morfin> how then i can bind to * without overlapping events
[01:36:09] <Cork> morfin: the simplest solution would be to have a function you use
[01:36:13] <Cork> and in it store the event handlers
[01:36:22] <fabioportieri> abishek: $("elem").trigger("click"); or just .click();
[01:36:26] <Cork> morfin: why would you ever bind * ?
[01:36:42] <Cork> abishek: you shouldn't do that
[01:36:43] <morfin> click to anything but select will cause closing dialog
[01:36:54] <Cork> abishek: bind submit on the form and it would just work
[01:37:23] <Cork> abishek: never ever bind click on a submit button for doing form submission
[01:37:34] <abishek> Cork, I have 3 different forms on the UI, SignUp, SignIn and ForgotPassword
[01:37:43] <Cork> abishek: ok?
[01:37:52] <Cork> so bind submit on each form
[01:38:09] <morfin> maybe $("*").off("click.myplugin")? then $("*").on("click.myplugin",function(event){...})
[01:38:38] <abishek> when the SignIn view is displayed and when the enter key is pressed, it should only perform the submit for the SignIn and not the others
[01:38:57] <Cork> morfin: again why would you bind hundreds maybe thousands of event listeners on the page?
[01:39:12] <Cork> morfin: just bind one event listener on document and be done with it
[01:39:37] <morfin> hmm
[01:39:51] <Tekla> how do i remove previously established listeners?
[01:39:56] <Cork> abishek: so just fo .focus() in one of the fields on the form that is visible
[01:40:05] <Cork> abishek: the rest would work on it's own
[01:40:12] <abishek> ok, let me try
[01:40:16] <Cork> Tekla: .off()
[01:40:24] <Cork> fo==do
[01:40:37] <Tekla> i tried $("body").off() .. that's not enough
[01:40:58] <Tekla> and $("*").off() kills the autocomplete fields too
[01:41:00] <Cork> Tekla: is the event bound with jquery?
[01:41:03] <morfin> :D
[01:41:05] <Tekla> yes
[01:41:12] <morfin> but i use namspaced events
[01:41:18] <Cork> what is the selector +event you bind?
[01:41:18] <morfin> *namespaced
[01:41:40] <morfin> look i have a link, i bind to link
[01:41:51] <Tekla> the same listener is bound over & over when i reload parts of the page with ajax
[01:42:02] <Tekla> cos old listeners don't work on new content
[01:42:06] <Cork> Tekla: well you shouldn't do that
[01:42:18] <Tekla> so how do i do it?
[01:42:19] <Cork> just add a static listener once and let it handle all of it
[01:42:31] <Cork> i need to see the event listener to say
[01:42:37] <Cork> i'm not a mind reader
[01:43:48] <morfin> i am not sure how will i check if that's evelent which i need
[01:44:14] <Cork> evelent?
[01:44:24] <morfin> *element
[01:44:36] <Cork> ex.
[01:44:53] <Cork> $('table').delegate('.delete', 'click', function() {})
[01:45:07] <Cork> it will bind the event listener on the table
[01:45:21] <Cork> and listen for click events bubbling up from ".delete" elements
[01:46:15] <abishek> Cork, thnx works fine
[01:46:32] <morfin> as example i $(".add_condition").myselect({...}); and myselect have some namespaced event(which closes opened select if it's opened)
[01:54:06] <Amnesia> Cork: unfortunately I don't really get the difference between click() and delegate(), both attach an event handler to an event, only click() attaches to the "click event"
[01:54:18] <Amnesia> which actually does make sense in this context right, since the buttons are being clicked on
[01:55:37] <Amnesia> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9122078/difference-between-onclick-vs-click
[01:57:10] <Amnesia> it's the stuff being described in the second comment you were referring to right?
[01:59:34] <Cork> Amnesia: sounds like you need to read up about the basics of dom and dom events
[01:59:45] <Amnesia> Cork: will do^^
[01:59:52] <Amnesia> thx a lot for your patience

[02:03:13] <Cork> the editors of mdn
[02:03:25] <fabioportieri> ..why so?
[02:03:25] <Cork> they remove info and add pointless ramble in it's place
[02:03:39] <Cork> fabioportieri: not sure, ask them
[02:04:11] <Cork> also they take one page describing, and split it up into 5 pages explaining parts, but not how they work together
[02:04:30] <Cork> *one page describing a function/feature
[02:11:54] <raj> this is my plugin http://paste.ofcode.org/zAPUcFtS5hgZfKWCcNbGx4  how do I allow it to accept an argument (after its initialization), which will run a function? for example $mymenu.('close')
[02:12:53] <Cork> raj: check if o is an object
[02:12:58] <Cork> if it isn't run the close function
[02:13:23] <Cork> also .('close') isn't valid js
[02:13:57] <raj> sorry, had an extra period there
[02:14:17] <raj> actually, no, I wrote that all wrong
[02:14:18] <Cork> well $mymenu('close') isn't valid either :)
[02:14:27] <raj> $mymenu.makeMenu('close')
[02:15:03] <Cork> raj: well the function at the bottom handles that
[02:15:12] <Cork> just add the close to the methods object
[02:16:42] <raj> ahh! right
[02:16:43] <raj> thank you!

[02:33:19] <Amnesia> the save button's still not working when delegate()'s being used
[02:33:54] <Amnesia> (the save button actually shouldn't be handled by javascript at all..)
[02:41:07] <lite_> meh :/ the jquery slideDown and slideUp animations look ugly :/
[02:43:56] <Crucials> Isnt the slideUp just a height = 0 animation?
[02:46:19] <lite_> dont knpw
[02:46:34] <fabioportieri> lite_: maybe you're animating too much stuff at once?
[02:47:00] <lite_> could be - although i hope not
[03:24:46] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/Cgewj/8/ should be fine right..?
[03:29:52] <morfin> as i know it's better to ues namespaced event handlers in my plugin
[03:29:57] <morfin> like click.filter
[03:32:20] <Amnesia> haven't I already done that?
[03:32:44] <Amnesia> or are you referring yo button.save?
[03:33:10] <Amnesia> s/yo/to
[03:35:05] <morfin> hmm if i off("change") for select does it off namespaced events?
[03:35:39] <ravenzz> yep
[03:35:52] <morfin> :(
[03:37:36] <ravenzz> you can work around it
[03:37:39] <ravenzz> I guess
[03:41:22] <ravenzz> get the element's events $._data( elem[0], "events") loop through them and check for handleObj.namespace if it is falsy
[03:42:29] <ravenzz> say that evt = e.handleObj; you off(evt.type, evt.handler)
[03:43:14] <ravenzz> if selector is undefined or off(evt.type, evt.selector, evt.handler) if evt.data is undefined and so on
[03:43:23] <ravenzz> this is a bit hackish tho
[03:45:49] <Amnesia> ravenzz: does my code look any good to you?
[03:46:13] <morfin> but...
[03:46:14] <morfin> \
[03:46:23] <ravenzz> Amnesia I wasn't following. Can you repeat the question?
[03:46:42] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/Cgewj/8/
[03:47:02] <Amnesia> for some reason the submit button (save) doesn't work on the cloned table row
[03:47:24] <ravenzz> why don't you use on() ?
[03:47:28] <Amnesia> so Cork advised me to make use of delegate() instead of click(), but the form still isn't submitted
[03:47:40] <Amnesia> cause unfortunately I'm forced to use jquery 1.5
[03:48:12] <ravenzz> eheh did you read the clone documenetation?
[03:48:14] <ravenzz> :)
[03:48:21] <Amnesia> yep
[03:48:48] <ravenzz> so you must know that clone takes two (optional) parameters
[03:49:01] <morfin> hm
[03:49:05] <ravenzz> clone( [withDataAndEvents ] [, deepWithDataAndEvents ] )
[03:49:13] <Amnesia> hm
[03:49:26] <ravenzz> both of them are boolean and false by default
[03:49:31] <Amnesia> yep
[03:50:15] <Amnesia> I've tried true, false|true,true|false,false etc..
[03:50:26] <ravenzz> and ?
[03:50:38] <Amnesia> no succes:P
[03:50:51] <Amnesia> the save button on the cloned rule keeps unresponsive
[03:50:56] <Amnesia> s/keeps/stays
[03:51:18] <ravenzz> k let me look at your code then
[03:51:24] <Amnesia> ty
[03:57:52] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/Cgewj/9/ <- I changed the html to clear stuff up
[04:00:01] <ravenzz> Amnesia http://jsfiddle.net/Cgewj/10/
[04:00:24] <ravenzz> Amnesia cache your selections
[04:00:59] <Amnesia> let me have a look:)
[04:03:02] <Amnesia> where do tableSelector and cloneSector get defined?
[04:03:12] <Amnesia> or are it the two arguments to cloneRow()?
[04:03:18] <ravenzz> yep they are
[04:03:37] <ravenzz> but that part is not that important
[04:10:15] <Amnesia> I'm trying to understand the differences atm:)
[04:13:18] <ravenzz> Amnesia probably appendTo('myTable') is the reason why yours wasn't working
[04:13:29] <ravenzz> you forgot the hash #
[04:13:46] <Amnesia> hm
[04:14:33] <Amnesia> nope, the "save button" is still not submitting the page
[04:17:12] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: it appears you could use some debugging
[04:17:53] <Amnesia> well, I have tried some debug code that triggers alert() when $('button.save').click() is triggered, and that works
[04:18:07] <Amnesia> but it doesn't submit the input, so the backend can handle the data
[04:33:04] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: currently as for debugging, I'm using firefox's web console
[04:33:35] <morfin> hmm
[04:37:38] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: i recommend to not chain stuff too much as you will loose track of the return values, for debugging
[04:38:28] <Amnesia> ty for the tip
[04:42:35] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: is there perhaps anything else you can spot that could prevent the button in a clone <tr> from working?
[04:58:44] <morfin> anybody knows plugin to show select when link is clicked?
[05:02:03] <morfin> i want to show select when link is clicked and that select should have fixed height
[05:03:26] <Crucials> what do you mean by 'show select'?
[05:04:50] <morfin> i mea i want to show some select box when you click some link(and do something when value has changed)
[05:06:47] <Crucials> I would probably add a class to the select box when you click the link, and that class would make it visible using css
[05:07:18] <Crucials> to do something when the value changed, try .change
[05:14:33] <vsoftoiletpaper> hello
[05:15:06] <vsoftoiletpaper> is there a method similar to next which matches all the siblings after
[05:15:15] <vsoftoiletpaper> instead of only the fist after
[05:15:37] <airdem> hi guys $('.class1, .class2') <-- why cant i select 2 objects like this? $(obj1, obj2)
[05:15:49] <vsoftoiletpaper> like findNext()
[05:15:57] <vsoftoiletpaper> ?
[05:16:06] <airdem> children()
[05:16:13] <airdem> ah no
[05:16:23] <airdem> you just need to do parent().find()
[05:16:55] <airdem> go one level up and use .find() or .children() (only siblings)
[05:16:57] <Crucials> something like http://api.jquery.com/siblings/ maybe?
[05:17:00] <Crucials> .siblings
[05:17:09] <airdem> :)
[05:17:25] <vsoftoiletpaper> Crucials but I want only the siblings in front
[05:20:33] <vsoftoiletpaper> so there is no way..
[05:20:35] <airdem> there is
[05:20:43] <vsoftoiletpaper> is there?
[05:21:15] <vsoftoiletpaper> siblingsNext() ?
[05:21:19] <airdem> get a list of all siblings including the element itself
[05:21:27] <Crucials> oh, this will probably work
[05:21:31] <Crucials> .nextAll
[05:21:37] <vsoftoiletpaper> .nextAll?

[05:35:55] <Amnesia> Cork: I've changed the code, but I'm still having exactly the same behaviour..
[05:38:20] <walidvb> guys, i'm thinking of dev'ing a full-featured dynamic script adder, principally for jquery plugin testing, but maybe more. do you think that would be useful?
[05:38:25] <walidvb> idea is the following: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/vqkKu/1/
[05:39:00] <Jonta> walidvb: Without popup perhaps?
[05:39:05] <walidvb> ideally, it would fetch all cdnjs, have a set of built-in common libs (such as bootsrap, etc)
[05:39:15] <walidvb> Jonta: i was thinking of a modal window, actually
[05:39:49] <Jonta> Aren't they the same?
[05:39:58] <Jonta> Or did you mean a custom one?
[05:40:11] <walidvb> Jonta: how do you mean without popup?
[05:40:25] <walidvb> i meant a custom one
[05:40:27] <Jonta> Something that slides down instead
[05:40:33] <Jonta> Closer to the cursor
[05:40:35] <walidvb> sure, whatever :)
[05:40:38] <Jonta> (Fitts's law)
[05:40:39] <Jonta> :p
[05:41:00] <walidvb> well, if you have options, you need a proper dialog window/panel
[05:41:37] <walidvb> inspired by subtlepatterns bookmarklet
[05:42:05] <Jonta> Can't you just .hide all that?
[05:42:36] <walidvb> Jonta: i'm not sure you/I understand
[05:42:59] <Jonta> Arrow left of the text, pointing to the right.
[05:43:15] <Jonta> Click text/arrow, and it turns downwards, giving you options
[05:43:19] <walidvb> left of which text?
[05:43:27] <Jonta> "Add a script"
[05:44:17] <airdem> var dlg = $('<div/>'); or var dlg = $('<div>'); ?? both seem to work but what is more correct?
[05:44:18] <walidvb> oh. no, it would be a bookmarklet
[05:44:18] <walidvb> like this: http://bradjasper.com/subtle-patterns-bookmarklet/
[05:44:49] <walidvb> airdem: / close it
[05:45:31] <airdem> alright. but in html5 there is no such need anymore, isnt it?
[05:45:46] <walidvb> So that when you dev, you can very easily add a script/library, run your code in the console, and test the plugin on your page, see how it behaves, etc..
[05:45:49] <airdem> like <br>
[05:46:04] <walidvb> without having to download the script, save it, add it to your page, etc..
[05:46:56] <walidvb> ftm it only takes a url, but before i start dev'ing smth more complex, i'd like some feedback on the usefullness of that, and perhaps suggestions about features.
[05:48:27] <walidvb> then, about implementation. I'm thinking of using angular, and perhaps bootstrap for the theming(even though that might break some pages. either i'll strip out what's not needed from bootstrap, and add a wrapper class so that it doesn't affect anyone else)
[05:48:47] <walidvb> Can anyone see themselves using such a thing?
[05:49:08] <walidvb> himself*
[05:50:24] <Jonta> *themselves
[05:50:31] <Jonta> Ugh. Fuck IE.
[05:50:45] <walidvb> themselves, correct :)
[06:05:57] <airdem> $(this).prop('action') <-- returns me an <input> element ('this' is a form element) .. shouldnt it return the value of the action attribute instead?
[06:08:38] <airdem> $(this).attr('action') returns me the correct value
[06:08:56] <airdem> but i thought .attr got replaced by .prop ... strange
[06:49:59] <shoky> airdem it didn't get replaced, it just got fixed. they do different things. and it sounds like thats happening to you because you have an input with name=action
[06:50:26] <shoky> some browsers stupidly add properties to the form element named like the form's inputs
[06:50:41] <shoky> anyway you want the attribute value, so use .attr
[06:50:57] <airdem> shoky, thank you for explaining
[06:52:42] <grafi> good thing shoky knows whats up
[06:53:10] <grafi> the difference between attributes and properties is somewhat unclear to me ^^
[06:53:15] <BillCriswell> Chrome changing up the scrollbars on me and shit.
[06:53:51] <airdem> grafi, did some reading: html elements have attributes and dom objects have properties
[06:54:34] <BillCriswell> I still don't fully understand that stuff too clearly. I should read up on it.
[06:55:39] <grafi> tbh i never had a problem with it ... i dont really care xD
[06:56:03] <grafi> maybe im just a natural talent when it comes to decide whether to use attr or prop
[06:56:05] <grafi> :P
[06:56:16] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[06:56:33] <airdem> if you have an <input name="action"> inside <form action="foo.php"> you will have problems with $('form').prop('action');
[06:56:42] <airdem> as shoky pointed out
[06:56:46] <grafi> i mean with a 50/50 change everytime you would expect it to fail me eventually
[06:56:47] <shoky> knowing the difference indeed doesn't usually help in figuring out which you want to use
[06:56:53] <shoky> because browsers are idiotz
[06:57:03] <shoky> and they sync between some attrs/props
[06:57:10] <grafi> that may well be in my advantage
[06:57:15] <shoky> but some of those syncs are not 1-for-1
[06:57:21] <grafi> yeah I read that
[06:57:24] <shoky> so it all sucks balls really, that's my professional opinion
[06:57:28] <grafi> never really noticed it though
[06:57:42] <grafi> you should get that on a tshirt
[06:58:03] <BillCriswell> "For a given DOM node object, properties are the properties of that object, and attributes are the elements of the attributes property of that object."
[06:58:17] <shoky> pfft
[06:58:28] <BillCriswell> Flows off the tongue.
[06:59:08] <airdem> the part after , is total foobar
[06:59:14] <grafi> could have been cantonese, wouldnt have made a difference
[06:59:14] <grafi> :p
[06:59:30] <Jonta> Needs more diagrams
[06:59:48] <BillCriswell> I saw some comparison where someone used prop vs attr and the time differences were pretty big relatively speaking.
[06:59:56] <airdem> its nice to explain a word with itself...
[07:00:18] <Jonta> airdem: -1 :p
[07:00:45] <airdem> proud is the feeling you have when you feel proud
[07:01:04] <airdem> damn, i need a break, brb
[07:01:52] <grafi> break is the feeling you have when you need a break
[07:01:53] <BillCriswell> Breaks are vital.
[07:02:03] <grafi> sleep would be cool
[07:02:22] <grafi> my inner clock is f***d up as hell
[07:02:44] <BillCriswell> I spent 4 hours on something yesterday, after getting annoyed like 3 hours in. I figured it out in 15 minutes this morning.
[07:03:17] <NoiseEee> absolutely true BillCriswell
[07:03:24] <Jonta> airdem: http://xkcd.com/739/
[07:03:35] <NoiseEee> kind of amazing how all that stuff works 'behind the scenes'
[07:04:20] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I'd love to understand it better.
[07:04:24] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: ++
[07:04:27] <airdem> BillCriswell, most of the worlds inventions are born through taking a break followed by a short moment of insight resulting in an heureka! moment
[07:04:42] <grafi> thats why I take breaks all the time
[07:04:47] <fabioportieri> it happens to me all the fucking time, that's why programmers shouldn't do too many extra hours
[07:04:48] <grafi> not because im lazy
[07:04:50] <airdem> :)
[07:04:51] <fabioportieri> imo
[07:05:58] <airdem> i believe it is similar to a helicopter ride over a desert, seeing that there are patterns behind all this mess of sand
[07:06:03] <BillCriswell> Totally understood.
[07:06:59] <airdem> Jonta, that is how i feel when reading a wiki article about any math subject
[07:07:02] <airdem> every time
[07:07:24] <Jonta> airdem: Well in that case http://xkcd.com/547/
[07:08:59] <BillCriswell> airdem: If you ever want your head to explode check out ##math.
[07:09:55] <airdem> 700 ppl there. wow
[07:10:21] <fabioportieri> what would you say to an idiot who considers jquery
[07:10:35] <BillCriswell> I really want to go through all the math classes at Kahn Academy. Start from 4th grae and go forward just to get a fresh head about it.
[07:10:38] <fabioportieri> outdated and shitty because "in angular you don't have to do so much dom manipulation"
[07:10:42] <airdem> fabioportieri, is that a joke or smth?
[07:10:58] <fabioportieri> airdem: true story i got permbanned for replying to him
[07:11:18] <fabioportieri> even if angularjs uses its own jquery version for that very purpose...
[07:12:04] <airdem> BillCriswell, every year im telling myself to go there and study ... no disciprine
[07:12:41] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: I'd probably just ignore them. It's a lot easier most of the time.
[07:13:17] <BillCriswell> airdem: I always do after I feel really dumb, which happened yesterday when I sat around in math for 20 minutes.
[07:14:07] <airdem> is there any nobel internet price or smth like that?
[07:14:37] <airdem> Kahn Academy would definetly deserve it. and wikipedia too of course :)
[07:15:16] <BillCriswell> If not I'm sure there will be one eventually haha
[07:15:26] <airdem> i would even consider the nobel peace price. but it is like it is: Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
[07:15:35] <morfin> hmmm i created so much clicks,changes,and other events..
[07:15:42] <morfin> *so many
[07:16:28] <morfin> I think I'm confused right now because of that :(
[07:16:36] <svetlana> does jquery provide extended regex facilities or do i need to use js's regex? just trying a complex match is all
[07:17:46] <shoky> svetlana: jquery doesn't provide any, no
[07:17:50] <BillCriswell> svetlana: Using ajax you can technically use whatever your server is using I guess haha.
[07:18:05] <BillCriswell> Unless you need to do it a lot of course...
[07:20:32] <Tumulte> Hi ! I'd like some help to understand a debug output :
[07:21:09] * airdem get ready for a massive paste
[07:21:22] <airdem> *gets
[07:21:35] <Tumulte> airdem: it's a single number actually, but I think I got it
[07:21:38] <Tumulte> (brb)
[07:25:09] <Tumulte> I want to remove a <li>, and I use its index right before it's deleted. when I console debug it I got its index AND -1
[07:25:17] <Tumulte> even if the remove comes after
[07:28:16] <morfin> hmm i am testing it right now
[07:28:59] <morfin> it showed me 3 as i expected(got index, saved to variable and then checked variable)
[07:30:30] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: http://jsbin.com/ohucedUd/1/edit?html,js,output this works as I'd expect.
[07:32:04] <Tumulte> cause I've launched the function multiple times
[07:32:21] <Tumulte> and the click is monitored multiple time
[07:32:50] <morfin> hm?
[07:33:26] <morfin> wow
[07:33:30] <blakespot> greetings
[07:33:41] <Tumulte> morfin: wow ?
[07:34:10] <morfin> but it worked)
[07:34:35] <Tumulte> indedd http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11661173/jquery-click-fires-multiple-times-inside-click-function
[07:35:13] <morfin> i think that's bubbling maybe
[07:35:17] <Tumulte> I think I'm doing this very badly, cause I fire a function affection ('.myclass') every time I add such an element
[07:35:37] <Tumulte> I know on( should be made for this, but I can't make it work
[07:35:52] <blakespot> I have a page with a static center column containing a list of titles that correspond to title headers in a scrolling right column. It can be seen in this screenshot: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2122133/div-marker.png
[07:36:34] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: Should be using event delegation.
[07:36:35] <blakespot> As the right column scrolls, when a title header (in a div) gets to the top of the browser window, I want to "mark" the corresponding item in the center column list
[07:36:35] <airdem> Tumulte, did you paste anything?
[07:36:36] <morfin> hmm i think i've found linkselect
[07:36:52] <Tumulte> airdem: no
[07:36:58] <morfin> that's what i was looking for
[07:37:13] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: sending the duck to get some infos about that
[07:37:19] <blakespot> so I need to detect when a div is within a certain proximity to the top of the browser, and fire an action
[07:37:22] <BillCriswell> Duck?
[07:37:32] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: duckduckgo
[07:37:33] <blakespot> anyone able to give me a tip, here?
[07:38:02] <morfin> you can fire an y event you want
[07:38:07] <morfin> as i know
[07:38:25] <blakespot> it's more about how to detect the proximity of these divs to the top of browser that I am wanting to know
[07:38:27] <Tumulte> blakespot: http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=position
[07:38:27] <airdem> blakespot, cant you retreive the css top: value ?
[07:39:02] <morfin> why not use offset?
[07:39:11] <airdem> i meant css position but i believe Tumulte suggestiong is better
[07:39:42] <morfin> position in .position is not asbsolute
[07:39:51] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: on replaced delegate
[07:40:03] <blakespot> I am very new to jquery, not at all new to javascript
[07:40:08] <morfin> but position returned by .offset is absolute
[07:40:34] <Tumulte> morfin: yeah I'm always mixing the two
[07:41:28] <BillCriswell> Tumulte: http://jsbin.com/ohucedUd/3/edit?html,js,output This is a pretty clear demo for event delegation I think.
[07:42:43] <morfin> hmmm
[07:42:46] <Tumulte> BillCriswell: hey cool
[07:44:07] <morfin> i saw that before: $ul.on('click', 'li', function(){
[07:47:07] <BillCriswell> morfin: It'd imagine it's a pretty common demo.
[07:47:42] <thebope> Hey everybody
[07:48:01] <BillCriswell> Hard to imagine list items without a list, where as if you just used a parent div with children div it may not be as clear.
[07:48:16] <morfin> not sure how that works
[07:48:17] <BillCriswell> thebope: Ayyyyy
[07:48:28] <BillCriswell> morfin: Event bubbling.
[07:48:45] <morfin> wait but bubbling is going upward
[07:48:51] <morfin> from li to ul
[07:48:55] <airdem> is there any neat way to run the js script of a htm file that just got loaded via ajax?
[07:48:57] <morfin> :O
[07:48:59] <BillCriswell> When you click the li you click the ul as well. Yo ucould even do $('body').on('click', 'li', foo);
[07:50:02] <BillCriswell> morfin: That's right. The second parameter of on ( if it's a string or jquery object i'd imagine ) will see if it was that type of element that triggered the event.
[07:52:39] <kk_drop> I would like to create in drupal commerce a shipping method, where price would change depend on product amount, weight and dimensions. I do all programming thing, but are there any hooks that can change the shipping price?
[07:53:53] <BillCriswell> kk_drop: Wrong room I think!
[07:54:00] <kk_drop> oh
[07:54:04] <kk_drop> you're right, sorry!
[07:58:23] <cboura> Hi, is there any reason why this code would not work in Firefox: document.getElementById(document.getElementsByTagName('interaction')[0].id) ?
[07:59:23] <cboura> I mean it executes correctly but it returns null
[07:59:33] <cboura> I would expect an element
[08:01:59] <airdem> there is no need for document ready if <script> is the last element in my htm file, correct?
[08:03:31] <fabioportieri> cboura: what do you expect that line to return?
[08:03:46] <cboura> I would expect the dom element
[08:04:08] <cboura> because getElementByTagName gives an element with an id
[08:04:42] <fabioportieri> and what you have instead?
[08:04:45] <NoiseEee> cboura: it returns a collection.
[08:05:07] <NoiseEee> cboura: you have a <interaction> tag?
[08:05:17] <fabioportieri> getElbyId doesn't return a collection i think
[08:05:39] <NoiseEee> i was talkin bout getElementByTagName
[08:06:01] <fabioportieri> but he has that wrapped on a doc..byId
[08:06:35] <cboura> yes I mean a collection
[08:06:50] <cboura> var id = document.getElementsByTagName('interaction')[0].id; var element = document.getElementById(id);
[08:06:55] <cboura> element is null
[08:06:57] <NoiseEee> cboura: you have a <interaction> tag?
[08:07:00] <cboura> id is 'interaction102'
[08:07:03] <cboura> yes I have one
[08:07:09] <NoiseEee> what is that?
[08:07:33] <cboura> what do u mean?
[08:08:47] <NoiseEee> cboura: make a fiddle.
[08:08:59] <cboura> fiddle are working :(
[08:09:17] <cboura> I can t really reproduce this error
[08:09:20] <fabioportieri> then the problem isn't that line cboura
[08:09:21] <cboura> and it's only on firefox
[08:10:17] <webfox> blackkbot: what happens today is there is a page .html for each menu item and it reloads the entire page but what really need to be updated is one div which contains an image and a few lines of text.
[08:11:58] <cboura> fabioportieri: actually I do not understand why it s not working
[08:12:02] <wbeeler> how do you remove text out of an example like this one, but leave the <input> tag? Example: <p>Some Text <input type="text" /></p>   ...I want to just get rid of the "some text" string.. remove it, whatever
[08:12:23] <fabioportieri> cboura: you have to debug your page with firebug or chrome devtools
[08:12:31] <cboura> yes
[08:13:10] <webfox> Is it possible to make a menu <a> tag control a <div> without having to reload the entire page?
[08:13:14] <cboura> I did it
[08:13:30] <cboura> but I can not found why it's not working
[08:14:46] <Crucials> wbeeler: can you remove everything and add the input again?
[08:15:25] <scar> webfox, control a div?
[08:15:32] <wbeeler> Crucials: well, i tried that, i ended up with the input being viewable to everyone instead of being code like it was
[08:15:39] <wbeeler> Crucials: how do i change that
[08:16:38] <webfox> scar: yes, I mean update the contents of this div. Each menu option has one content to input into this div. Otherwise I will have to create 8 .html pages and reload even the static content for each menu.
[08:17:05] <scar> webfox, yeah you can use ajax to help with that too, so you dont have to output all of the pages on one load
[08:17:12] <Crucials> wbeeler try appending "<input></input>" to $('p') instead of putting it in .text()
[08:17:25] <scar> or you can use multiple divs, hiding them except the one being viewed, and use the <a> tags to trigger  which DIV is shown... or just use ajax ;)
[08:17:27] <Crucials> wbeeler: or you could probably just do it in .html()
[08:17:29] <scar> $.ajax
[08:17:32] <wbeeler> Crucials: ahhh... ok sounds like a plan
[08:17:38] <wbeeler> Crucials: thx
[08:17:42] <scar> ^^ webfox
[08:17:43] <Crucials> btw .text strips the html stuff
[08:17:46] <Crucials> basically*
[08:17:54] <wbeeler> ok thx
[08:18:00] <webfox> scar: I got it, but I don't know much of ajax.
[08:18:40] <scar> webfox, ajax will query a URL (probably .php or whatever lang you are using) and will take the output, and then send it to the JS.
[08:18:49] <scar> if you dont wanna do that, then use the ohtero ption
[08:19:06] <webfox> scar: I would have to replace the div each time.
[08:19:37] <webfox> scar: don't you know a tutorial for that by any chance?
[08:26:04] <hesco> I have a radio set and want to harvest the value of the option chosen for further use, how would one do that please?
[08:29:09] <hesco> I'm thinking along the lines of:  $('.list_options [type=radio]').change( function() { var index = $(this).parent().value(); etc. })  Am I on the wrong path here?
[08:29:17] <decx> hesco $('input:radio[name=group]:checked').val();
[08:29:49] <hesco> thanks decx: I will play with that and see where this takes me.
[08:29:53] <Crucials> if its the value you want to store
[08:30:17] <hesco> it is, and link that to class names for other elements of the form.
[08:37:27] <scar> webfox, no ,you can load all divs and use css ti display:none on them all, and use JS to determin which div to show
[08:37:47] <scar> webfox, you either have to load all divs at once, or use ajax to load each div
[08:37:53] <scar> well, the contents of each div
[08:38:15] <webfox> scar: any test available?
[08:39:18] <webfox> scar: this div will be always placed at same position.
[08:40:28] <decx> do you have a couple of html pages done already?
[08:40:33] <scar> webfox, okay, again, you can use MULTIPLE DIVS using CSS to hide them
[08:40:38] <scar> and then using JS to show
[08:40:51] <scar> OR, you can use the same div, and use each A click as a trigger to pull content via ajax
[08:41:06] <scar> once you get the content, you use .html() to replace the contents of said div
[08:41:12] <scar> webfox, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:41:45] <scar> webfox, if you use multiple divs, you can set them all to the same class so they will all appear the same, just have JS hide them
[08:41:53] <scar> or CSS to hide, to protect non js peeps
[08:42:06] <decx> all 3 of them ^^
[08:43:26] <maxmoore14> using JQM with autoInitializePage=false, is there any way to show some type of spinner before $.mobile.initializePage is called?
[08:43:47] <webfox> ok, I will have a look at those. But I am just starting to learn js. Perhaps a good opportunity to develop a few skills. Problem will be deadline. :D
[08:45:32] <maxmoore14> or a splashscreen would work too...
[08:45:57] <maxmoore14> just some way to load and display an image before $.mobile.initializePage
[08:57:59] <airdem> var data = $(data).find('#selector > *'); why does data.find('element'); not work now?
[08:58:30] <airdem> i believe it has to do with the > * selector. you guys know any workaround to make .find() work or is there another way?
[08:58:31] <BillCriswell> airdem: What id data?
[08:58:41] <BillCriswell> What is data*
[08:58:52] <airdem> $.get(url, function(data) { ... });
[08:59:38] <BillCriswell> Is #seletor a direct child of body?
[08:59:42] <airdem> it is because var data = $(data).find('#selector > *'); returns an array of objects and no an object itself i believe
[08:59:52] <airdem> *not an
[09:00:06] <duch_kazatel> airdem .find() is for DOM objects, not for searching arrays.
[09:00:19] <BillCriswell> Try to do  $(data).filter('#selector').find('> *')
[09:00:50] <decx> without knowing what's the plan it's hard to make a recommendation i'd say
[09:01:29] <airdem>  var data = $(data).find('#selector > *') works as expected but as duch_kazatel pointed out .find only works with dom objects
[09:02:08] <airdem> is there a workaround for .find in this case or should i convert the resulting array into a dom object? (if yes, how?)
[09:02:08] <duch_kazatel> look at BillCriswell's suggestion, see if that works.
[09:03:42] <airdem> that suggestion returns an empty object
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> airdem what is the data object itself?  markup?
[09:04:31] <airdem> found a workaround by appending the resulting array to a dom object but i was wondering if there is another (better) way
[09:04:45] <duch_kazatel> airdem are you just trying to search through an array?
[09:05:01] <airdem> $(data).find('#selector > *'); seems to return an array of objects
[09:05:12] <BillCriswell> airdem: What is data though?
[09:05:37] <airdem> $.get(url, function(data) { ... }); the data that gets returns by $.get
[09:05:43] <airdem> *returned
[09:05:49] <airdem> html
[09:06:20] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/2CgRR/2/ does this clear up anything? managed to dig up an example I did the other day.
[09:06:58] <duch_kazatel> airdem even the basic selector returns an array.
[09:07:38] <decx> what's the point of  $(data).find('#selector > *'); as opposed to just $(data).find('#selector'); anyway?
[09:07:49] <maxmoore14> using JQM with autoInitializePage=false, is there any way to show some type of image like a spinner or splashscreen before $.mobile.initializePage is called?
[09:08:09] <fabioportieri> decx: they don't target the same thing
[09:08:21] <duch_kazatel> decx direct children vs. all children.
[09:08:43] <duch_kazatel> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/ - number 8
[09:09:04] <airdem> took me an eternity to find that out :) ... :(
[09:09:10] <decx> yeah right, but when you jsut want to search in there then just find('#selector') would be better wouldnt it?
[09:09:21] <airdem> i kind of want to do both
[09:09:37] <duch_kazatel> in his case he wants the first children of #selector
[09:09:54] <BillCriswell> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/2CgRR/3/ Does this help at all?
[09:09:56] <duch_kazatel> rather, the first child
[09:10:04] <airdem> BillCriswell, still looking into it
[09:10:12] <BillCriswell> airdem: That's an update with some comments.
[09:10:22] <BillCriswell> with my explanation... not sure it's right however lol.
[09:10:26] <BillCriswell> But it wors.
[09:10:29] <BillCriswell> works.
[09:10:29] <airdem> BillCriswell, thank you very much
[09:10:30] <decx> maxmoore14 i never used jqm but i'd put a loading class with a css background image of a spinner, and when you're done initializing remove the loader class
[09:11:17] <maxmoore14> decx: the problem is JQM-specific though because of the way it does ajax page loading
[09:12:02] <airdem> BillCriswell, yeah thats exactly what i was looking for
[09:12:07] <airdem> thanks a lot
[09:12:17] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:12:43] <BillCriswell> I guess jQuery ignores the head and body element when it's making the references to the nodes?
[09:13:25] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't sound right to me.
[09:13:38] <duch_kazatel> but it's friday and i'm slowly caffeinating.
[09:13:50] <decx> wait you can find a direct child of body?
[09:13:53] <decx> can't*
[09:13:59] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to.
[09:14:11] <decx> i never actually tried but it seems wrong that you can't :D
[09:14:11] <duch_kazatel> body > *
[09:14:16] <duch_kazatel> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:14:30] <decx> i feel dirty when i use > *
[09:14:58] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I don't know how to target body or head when doing $(htmlDocumentString).
[09:15:31] <duch_kazatel> is that what the URL in your fiddle returns?
[09:15:38] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:15:48] <duch_kazatel> yup
[09:15:48] <BillCriswell> http://fiddle.jshell.net/svp7U/1/show/ just plain ol' html.
[09:16:11] <airdem> that was a pretty good fiddle bro :)
[09:16:13] <BillCriswell> Doing $() on that string only seems to return children of body and head.
[09:16:41] <BillCriswell> Thanks! I'm just not sure that's the right way to accomplish that.
[09:17:19] <airdem> i believe find() only searches in data[0]
[09:17:35] <BillCriswell> There's a $.parseHTML() function that seems like it might be useful.
[09:17:58] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need it - once you pass it to $() it gets converted to a document fragment.
[09:18:27] <BillCriswell> Ah, I see.
[09:18:46] <duch_kazatel> document fragments are p neat.  but you're right - you can't do a find of the document body.  i'm poking at the "why" real quick.
[09:18:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nice.
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> woah.  check out $html in your example.  the body tag was dropped and ooooh i get it.
[09:20:34] <duch_kazatel> looks like the root element gets "moved" to past body.
[09:21:53] <duch_kazatel> aaaah no i'll bet it's something weird like body becomes the root element so because you're in a fragment the container gets lost or someshit.
[09:22:59] <BillCriswell> I'll chalk it up to magic!
[09:23:09] <duch_kazatel> ~*magic*~
[09:24:17] <decx> well thanks for the heads up if i ever have to use find on a direct child of body i won't have to choke somebody
[09:24:31] <decx> filter it !
[09:24:42] <duch_kazatel> yup filter is your friend.
[09:25:02] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[09:25:29] <decx> and if somebody asks, a wizard did it
[09:26:13] <derryl> ¯\(º_o)/¯
[09:26:37] <duch_kazatel> ಠ_ಠ
[09:27:46] <BillCriswell> I love that face.
[09:28:06] <BillCriswell>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ is good too
[09:28:10] <duch_kazatel> the lod?  fun fact - basically all javascript parsers support full UTF-8, so you can use that for variable names.
[09:28:27] <BillCriswell> haha nice.

[09:29:32] <BillCriswell> Haha, seeing it in a url is weird
[09:29:35] <derryl> haha, that's awesome
[09:29:37] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:29:43] <derryl> ಠ_ಠ("error: file exists");
[09:29:51] <duch_kazatel> exactly!
[09:30:06] <derryl> now to sneak it into some production code .... la dee da
[09:30:27] <derryl> nothing to see here Jenkins
[09:30:40] <duch_kazatel> god if we didn't have everything code reviewed i'd totally to do.
[09:30:40] <decx> all my 404 pages have hidden breasts (o)(o). customers never notice ^^
[09:30:42] <duch_kazatel> *do it
[09:31:12] <derryl> ha! there would actually be no stopping me ... my code is never reviewed
[09:31:29] <derryl> (i wish it were)
[09:31:40] <duch_kazatel> we have to do it for PCI compliance.
[09:31:53] <derryl> ah, def
[09:34:46] <ButtDog> I've been stuck for days trying to validate a form before submitting it. I think I'm close
[09:34:57] <ButtDog> Can anyone tell me why this wont submit after validation? http://dpaste.com/1556694/
[09:35:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing anywhere that you submit the form.
[09:36:12] <duch_kazatel> ah -  $('#upload').submit(function(){
[09:36:38] <duch_kazatel> have you tried stepping through with a debugger?
[09:37:09] <ButtDog> duch_kazatel hmm, I haven't perhaps Firebug?
[09:37:17] <duch_kazatel> firebug and chrome dev tools both do it.
[09:37:45] <duch_kazatel> this is a prime candidate - what's up with the timeout, btw?
[09:38:04] <duch_kazatel> ah, you're using it to update progress.
[09:38:28] <ButtDog> Sorry it's a mess I'm new to Javascript/JQuery
[09:38:51] <duch_kazatel> it's actually not too bad, though I'd really suggest not doing things like if (valid == false) return false;
[09:39:09] <ButtDog> duch_kazatel: mind if I pm you?
[09:39:14] <duch_kazatel> sure why not.
[09:46:13] <derryl> duch_kazatel: in all seriousness, do you know of cases where using ಠ_ಠ would fail? I didn't realize it's actually a standard UTF-8 character
[09:46:26] <derryl> i thought it was only part of extended charsets
[09:46:27] <duch_kazatel> it's actually 3 UTF-8 characters.
[09:46:38] <derryl> lol troll
[09:46:46] <duch_kazatel> aaaahahahha
[10:19:20] <maxmoore14> any idea why $('body').length === 0
[10:19:28] <maxmoore14> am I going nuts?
[10:20:14] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 in what context?
[10:20:30] <_rgn> dom not loaded
[10:20:36] <maxmoore14> do all scripts need to load before the DOM can be manipulated?
[10:20:48] <maxmoore14> _rgn: yeah, that's what I'm thinking now
[10:20:53] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 often times it's the other way around dom needs to be loaded first.
[10:29:47] <DarkGhost> anyone familiar with carousFredSel?
[10:38:23] <Tekla> Cork: thx... so what i need to do is bind my events to the divs that will have the content i want to run them on
[10:38:29] <Tekla> cool
[10:39:00] <Sample> Q: Why within $.ajax is "success" the only callback method that accepts "data" as a parameter in the argument signature? aren't 400 responses capable of sending back a response body/data as well?
[10:40:00] <Cork> Sample: yes they are
[10:40:59] <Sample> bizarre
[10:40:59] <Cork> Sample: the jqXHR object holds the response content
[10:41:23] <Cork> Sample: well 4xx and 5xx doesn't need to return the expect content
[10:41:32] <Cork> so it can't be managed the same way as success is
[10:41:52] <Cork> so xhr.responseText
[10:42:27] <Sample> "can't be"?
[10:42:42] <Cork> at least for 5xx
[10:42:50] <Sample> if a 4xx response dictates the Content Type to be "application/json" i don't get why it couldn't be parsed as data
[10:42:55] <Cork> the returned content can't be automatically parsed
[10:42:55] <t0th_-> what the diferrence between deviceready and mobileinit ?
[10:43:19] <Cork> Sample: cause some servers doesn't adjust the content type when they return errors
[10:43:43] <Sample> it has led me to the situation where my backend must return 200 even in the case of a failure (providing an errors array in the json "success" response)
[10:43:45] <Sample> which is disgusting
[10:44:12] <Sample> your data did not validate, here's a 200 with the errors
[10:44:31] <Sample> it seems wrong/erroneous of jquery. at best totally inconsistent
[10:45:07] <Sample> id rather return a 422
[10:45:47] <Cork> Sample: there is no 422
[10:46:01] <Cork> 417 is the highest http status value in 4xx
[10:46:29] <Sample> i believe you're mistaken
[10:46:32] <Sample> perhaps talking about some initial standard
[10:46:49] <Cork> Sample: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.18
[10:47:00] <Cork> microsoft have a few made up status numbers
[10:47:00] <Sample> oh no i'm incorrect sorry
[10:47:07] <Sample> that was off the top of my head. i was thinking of 412
[10:47:15] <Sample> no no
[10:47:19] <Sample> i take that back
[10:47:20] <Sample> i was correct
[10:47:27] <Cork> O_o
[10:47:33] <Cork> the spec goes to 417
[10:47:35] <Sample> its imply "not a part of the main HTTP spec"
[10:47:37] <Cork> the rest is made up
[10:47:37] <Sample> simply*
[10:47:48] <Cork> ya, it is made up by some server operators
[10:47:52] <Sample> "I would recommend 422. It's not part of the main HTTP spec, but it is defined by a public standard (WebDAV) and it should be treated by browsers the same as any other 4xx status code."
[10:47:52] <Cork> it isn't a real status
[10:48:05] <dcherman> Sample: why do you need to return a 200 exactly?  you can just parse jqXHR.responseText
[10:48:11] <Sample> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.2
[10:48:45] <Sample> dcherman: i could JSON parse that string. but as i said above "at best totally inconsistent"
[10:49:36] <Sample> i'm willing to believe jquery has a reasoning ive just not come across it
[10:49:43] <dcherman> Sample: unfortunately that boat sailed a while ago, can't make breaking changes like that now i'd imagine.
[10:50:02] <Sample> dcherman: perhaps thats the case too
[10:50:56] <dcherman> Sample: you can easily do that on your own though with a simple prefilter ( although it's likely to break the hell out of any 3rd party scripts if you change argument order ).
[10:51:04] <Sample> something just feels awry doing my success/failure checks as an if statement within the "success"
[10:52:04] <Sample> dcherman: perhaps i could somehow extend ajax to pass 422 response to a method like "invalid"
[10:52:10] <Sample> $.ajax
[10:52:21] <Sample> parsing the Content Type and passing data like success
[10:52:45] <Sample> it still makes me scratch my head why only success passes data
[11:00:31] <dcherman> Sample: something like this would probably work - https://gist.github.com/dcherman/8479347 ( untested )
[11:02:39] <Sample> dcherman: interesting thanks. i'm not that familiar with jquery internals so that's neat
[11:03:01] <Sample> i would suppose the 422 should definitely parse the content type rather than simply $.parseJSON though=)
[11:03:04] <Sample> not sure how jquery goes about that
[11:04:31] <dcherman> Sample: it's just a simple example - i'm sure it could be made more robust by looking at the headers and parsing it appropriately.
[11:11:19] <Copter> I have got some jquery code in my index.php (and jquery referenced tehre). Now I need that jquery reference in multiple other pages (like header). How do I go about doing this?
[11:11:39] <Copter> (instead of adding that jquery reference in every other page
[11:13:29] <duch_kazatel> Copter you could always setup your shit to include a file that contains everything for <head>
[11:13:35] <pu239> think i'm losing my mind, i would have sworn this worked, i'm creating a modal dialog using bootstrap
[11:13:53] <pu239> i had one button named btnCreate and a function $('#btnCreate').click(function () {...
[11:14:01] <pu239> that works
[11:14:21] <pu239> but now i need a second button, so i removed the button id and tried this: $(document).on('click', '.btn', function () {
[11:14:46] <pu239> where the buttons use the btn class, but then the click event doesn't fire
[11:14:48] <pu239> any ideas?
[11:15:03] <duch_kazatel> "the click event doesn't fire" wat
[11:15:22] <Copter> duch_kazatel: yea but if both header.php and index.php (for example) would include that <head> file, i will get again duplicate reference to jquery
[11:15:24] <duch_kazatel> if you console.log inside that event handler things are solid, right?
[11:16:37] <duch_kazatel> Copter nonono - you should have a global php include for things that are global to the site.
[11:16:43] <pu239> i was obviously wrong, it does fire
[11:16:58] <duch_kazatel> and then only include that ones.
[11:17:00] <duch_kazatel> *ince
[11:17:02] <duch_kazatel> **once
[11:17:04] <duch_kazatel> fuck i can't type today
[11:20:22] <pu239> it's working now, i've definitely lost my mind
[11:20:29] <pu239> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help
[11:20:34] <duch_kazatel> no problem man
[11:24:23] <decx> everytime i rewrite a click to an on i misplace an }) somewhere and scratch my head for 10 minutes as to why nothings happening ^^
[11:24:44] <duch_kazatel> decx you have the console open, right?
[11:25:03] <decx> yeah but sometimes you're just blind as to what's wrong
[11:25:07] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[11:25:15] <decx> .... oh right... there's 2 }
[11:25:25] <decx> and then you continue to hit yourself in theface
[11:25:46] <decx> that's 20 minutes. another hour on the table for the customer ^^
[11:26:02] <duch_kazatel> I'm so used to being in firebug/using code completion/etc that i don't get that much any more.
[11:26:40] <decx> what do you use for codecompletion?
[11:26:49] <Copter> duch_kazatel: got it, thx!
[11:26:51] <duch_kazatel> sublime text 2 + package control
[11:26:55] <duch_kazatel> makes like amazing.
[11:27:07] <duch_kazatel> *life
[11:27:08] <decx> yeah i should finally cave in and buy sublime
[11:27:16] <duch_kazatel> i use it every day
[11:27:26] <duch_kazatel> even the free version is awesome.
[11:27:43] <decx> i ran it against my notepad++ install for a while but my workflow was just faster in np++
[11:28:00] <duch_kazatel> i was the exact same way for the longest time.
[11:28:03] <decx> i get distracted and put in ascii to make the code preview nice
[11:28:05] <decx> ^^
[11:28:30] <duch_kazatel> decx the real power of sublime text are the command/file palettes.
[11:28:40] <duch_kazatel> once you're used to them you'll wonder how you did without.
[11:32:41] <olavk> Hi. I have a question about api documentation. Once there was a link to download the complete api documentation as a single xml fil. However I cant seem to find this download anymore. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[11:33:41] <duch_kazatel> olavk not sure where that might be these days.  there  a reason you can't just use the web docs?
[11:34:39] <olavk> I want to autogenerate interfaces based on the api
[11:35:20] <olavk> I assume the web docs are generated from some source?
[11:36:45] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/resources/api.xml
[11:36:49] <duch_kazatel> is this not what you want?
[11:37:18] <olavk> Thank you very much, duch_kazatel
[11:38:12] <duch_kazatel> not a problem.  google is your friend.
[11:40:40] <olavk> Incedentally, do you know if the xml is the 'root' source of the documentation, or it is generated from something else?
[11:41:57] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea.  i would assume it might be?
[12:21:43] <guyz> does jQuery(document).ready execute several times or just once?
[12:22:23] <Uhkis> afaik only when dom becomes ready, so once
[12:22:47] <duch_kazatel> guyz the event only emits once, but you can listen for it in multiple places.
[12:23:03] <BillCriswell> I'll go with duch_kazatel answer.
[12:23:21] <duch_kazatel> the question was phrased a little funky ;)
[12:24:21] <talntid> anyone know of any html/css/jquery freelance channels?
[12:31:19] <duch_kazatel> probably nothing on freenode, talntid
[13:00:02] <dopie> hey all
[13:02:22] <hlve> lol
[13:03:20] <tp43_> I have a function in which I call $("input.nField[name=" + data.name + "]").each(function(index){… console.log('index: ' + index); and it works, I see index; 0, index: 1. But then I call another function and pass data.name to it, I console.log(newdataName) and see the correct value, but when I try $("input.nField[name=" + newdataName + "]").each(function(index){… console.log('index: ' + index);  it doesn't work, I don't see anything
[13:03:40] <hlve> tp43_, jsfiddle
[13:04:50] <tp43_> hlve:  ok let me try, it will take a few to set it up, if I can duplicate
[13:11:56] <tp43_> hlve:  can't duplicate, works on jsfiddle
[13:19:02] <BillCriswell> tp43_: At least you know what the problem isn't.
[13:19:23] <whatthepoop> stupid question! how come `$(document).on('ready', foo);` doesn't work the same (at all) as `$(document).ready(foo);`?
[13:21:27] <olavk_> I would like to contribute some improvement to the api documentation. Should I create a bug request for this?
[13:23:56] <BillCriswell> whatthepoop: Good question.
[13:24:37] <BillCriswell> whatthepoop: Hmmm..
[13:24:42] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: hahha
[13:25:25] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: my best almost-entirely-uninformed guess is that it might be something to do with the way events are dispatched and heard with jquery, and more specifically maybe the way the 'ready' event from the document object is faked in some weird manner....or something?
[13:25:54] <BillCriswell> whatthepoop: http://jsbin.com/etefOku/1/edit?html,js,output this worked for me
[13:26:04] <BillCriswell> Puts out hi twice.
[13:27:47] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: huh. I was testing with a 1.10.1 version, so I wonder if there's a difference.. will take another look incase I was doing something else wrong
[13:28:07] <BillCriswell> Worked with 1.10.2 as well
[13:28:31] <BillCriswell> Might be something else being weird.
[13:29:40] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: 1.9.1 not working for me (am I missing something?!): http://jsfiddle.net/wQ7K3/
[13:32:56] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: oh wait, it changes depending on where the code is, it looks like.. jsfiddle's default is to put it in an onLoad, which isn't working
[13:33:05] <whatthepoop> BillCriswell: but if I put it in the <head> using their option, it works.
[13:33:08] <BillCriswell> Yeah, just switched that.
[13:33:22] <BillCriswell> That was a fun one haha
[13:33:53] <whatthepoop> but not for older versions, it looks like, which (I'm guessing - forgot) didn't include 'on' like the newer versions do
[13:33:57] <whatthepoop> haha
[13:34:18] <whatthepoop> still not grasping why that may be, but interesting nonetheless
[13:34:37] <BillCriswell> YEah, think .on came around in 1.7
[13:34:53] <BillCriswell> Damn, I was right on the money. That's sad.
[13:35:02] <whatthepoop> hahah
[13:36:16] <BillCriswell> I've been in ##math all day pretending to myself that I understand what people are talking about. Good times.
[13:49:02] <docStorm> http://twofuckingdevelopers.com/2013/10/responsive-html5-video-players/
[13:51:49] <BillCriswell> I wish I blogged.
[13:56:19] <centran> what is the replacement to attr(). If I used to do $('#idName').attr('rel') then in jquery 1.10 what would I use to get an attrribute value
[13:56:52] <BillCriswell> centran: That's still fine. You might be thinking of .prop() though.
[13:57:43] <centran> Hmmm... cause it is retriving the value as unkown
[13:58:04] <dopie> hey all
[13:58:08] <BillCriswell> undefined or unknown/
[13:58:22] <dopie> I am currently having a problem
[13:58:54] <dopie> obviously with the click function running an animation but then it stops and goes to the link of the image
[13:59:07] <dopie> http://dev.staycreativedesign.com/  scroll down to the 2nd image
[13:59:15] <dopie>  "sean donaldson hair"
[13:59:34] <dopie> it starts the animation but then it gets interrupted
[13:59:41] <centran> Bill: undefined
[13:59:59] <BillCriswell> centran: You sure the selector is right?
[14:00:48] <centran> http://pastebin.com/7PfRHUez
[14:00:58] <BillCriswell> dopie: Having a hard time following the issue.
[14:01:28] <centran> I even tried replacing the ui.tab with the id name just in case that wasn't working and still nothing
[14:02:28] <dopie> BillCriswell, goto http://dev.staycreativedesign.com/
[14:02:33] <dopie> scroll downto RECENt WORKs
[14:02:42] <dopie> click on sean donaldsonhair image
[14:03:05] <BillCriswell> centran: http://jsbin.com/ikUVOfAB/1/edit?html,js,output at the simplest level it works, so there must be something else going on.
[14:03:07] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/8482573
[14:03:13] <dopie> it tries to run that
[14:03:26] <dopie> but it gets interrupted since the link is clicked
[14:03:47] <dopie> i want the function to finish THAN the user is directed to the url
[14:05:36] <BillCriswell> dopie: Trying to think of the best way to handle that.
[14:05:45] <centran> but it isn't showing Yessss in console?
[14:06:16] <Blue__Hat> Hi guys I have this fiddle that uses Jquery, I want the div that shows to have text elements in it that are only shown when you click the div
[14:06:18] <Blue__Hat> http://jsfiddle.net/kamron/BVkbF/8/
[14:06:23] <dopie> BillCriswell,  thanks :)
[14:07:44] <BillCriswell> centran: Must be jsbin doing something weird. Try looking at it here: http://jsbin.com/ikUVOfAB/1
[14:07:52] <Blue__Hat> BillCriswell: tsup?
[14:08:41] <BillCriswell> dopie: The only think I can think of is in that function stop the propogation then when the animation is done do closest('li').trigger('click')
[14:10:27] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Probabl easier to just have the text in a child div or something.
[14:10:44] <Blue__Hat> ok
[14:10:44] <BillCriswell> If I'm understanding right.
[14:11:27] <Blue__Hat> I want  expanded to show only when it is clicked and it will have images and so on in it
[14:11:48] <Blue__Hat> when not clicked it should be....
[14:11:52] <Blue__Hat> hold on...
[14:11:57] <Blue__Hat> let me try something
[14:12:40] <Blue__Hat> think I got it, just had a sort of eureka moment
[14:13:05] <BillCriswell> dopie: http://jsbin.com/isakIJer/1/edit?html,js,output is what I'm thinking, but people in here may know a more elegant way.
[14:13:20] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: They're nice.
[14:20:12] <Blue__Hat> yes they are...
[14:20:19] <Blue__Hat> will let you know how it goes
[14:24:14] <cortexman> question: when calling a.b.c.click, does click have access to c without having to reference a.b.c?
[14:25:33] <docStorm> fuckin A man. CIA man!
[14:49:50] <duch_kazatel> guys we're watching hackers in my office on a smartboard.
[14:49:52] <duch_kazatel> the future is now.
[14:57:58] <Linkandzelda> can anyone help me to apply .hide() on multiple numbered divs with ids like div-1, div-2 etc? ive been trying for ages
[14:58:14] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda easy peasy.
[14:59:00] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda do you have a fiddle?
[14:59:06] <Linkandzelda> i dont
[14:59:23] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda http://jsfiddle.net/ - put your html in the "HTML" panel and click "share"
[14:59:32] <shoky> sounds like you should be using a class instead
[15:01:25] <Linkandzelda> i cant even see a share button lol
[15:01:36] <duch_kazatel> err, "save"
[15:01:53] <Linkandzelda> http://jsfiddle.net/tb2nM/
[15:01:59] <duch_kazatel> before I do this - is there a reason you can't apply a class to each div instead?
[15:02:03] <Linkandzelda> it wont work since its missing php
[15:02:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tb2nM/1/
[15:03:50] <Linkandzelda> becuase I have multiple items
[15:03:53] <Linkandzelda> with different numbers
[15:04:07] <zumba_addict> hey folks, will the minified jquery contains comments? or it's pure code
[15:04:07] <Linkandzelda> i need to click on one, it unhides it and not all of them
[15:04:36] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict usually comments are stripped.
[15:04:41] <zumba_addict> cool
[15:04:48] <zumba_addict> i think that's what is causing our IE to fail
[15:04:56] <duch_kazatel> comments?
[15:05:15] <zumba_addict> yup
[15:05:20] <zumba_addict> no trailing commas
[15:05:30] <shoky> unlikely..
[15:05:32] <synth_> weird question: let's say i'm calling $.getJSON which returns data similar to: http://pastebin.com/zT4Fd10T; typically when i load that data i can just access entries like data.Nox1.. is there a way for me to do similar for the entry Deadline 5x Repository?
[15:05:38] <zumba_addict> can't find 1.9.1 minified
[15:05:46] <Linkandzelda> <div id="baldraw-<? echo $i; ?>" class="withdraw_inside"> <- inside a while loop that populates the items with baldraw-1, baldraw-2 etc. i want to know when I click baldraw-2 that only that has the stuff applied to it, same for all the rest
[15:05:49] <shoky> http://code.jquery.com
[15:06:13] <shoky> http://code.jquery.com/jquery/
[15:06:27] <zumba_addict> found it. thanks
[15:07:25] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda http://jsfiddle.net/8jn43/
[15:07:27] <duch_kazatel> that's the basic idea.
[15:07:39] <shoky> synth_:  data["Deadline 5x Repository"]
[15:08:01] <synth_> yeah, i know that one, i just didn't know if i had the ability to access it using a . if it has a space in it
[15:08:07] <synth_> like if it gets converted somehow
[15:08:08] <shoky> you don't
[15:08:20] <synth_> okay, no problem.
[15:08:21] <synth_> :)
[15:08:23] <synth_> thank you
[15:09:41] <basiclaser> gentlymanderins, how would you deploy a shop with a order distance limit function? For example, for a restaurant that doesn't want to deliver over xkm for $X or ykm for $Y
[15:10:05] <Linkandzelda> thanks duch_kazatel, how could I do something similar but with click event?
[15:10:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:10:11] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser huh?
[15:10:17] <duch_kazatel> and Linkandzelda wrap that in a click?
[15:10:32] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda the important part is the way i'm building the selector.
[15:10:51] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: how would you setup a shop so that people can't order food further than 6km from the restaurant?
[15:11:16] <duch_kazatel> i'd check when you enter their address.
[15:11:18] <synth_> basiclaser distance will vary given how much road the person has to cover... a simple x/y calculation probably wouldn't be accurate.
[15:11:22] <zumba_addict> yup, jquery isn;t the culprit!
[15:11:39] <zumba_addict> man, the whole team has been troubleshooting this IE issue for more than a week now
[15:11:59] <zumba_addict> when we do a POST using IE9, we get Invalid Character in console
[15:12:00] <synth_> unless you're talking about delivering within a radius
[15:12:00] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser after they enter their address and submit, you could tell them you can't deliver there.
[15:12:50] <shoky> zumba_addict: same origin request?
[15:12:50] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser if you're talking about traveling distance, you'll need to hook into an api to test, like google maps.
[15:13:26] <zumba_addict> shoky, it works fine in Chrome, but not in IE. In IE, i dont' see it even hitting or making a network request
[15:13:48] <shoky> zumba_addict: is the request to a different domain? or its all on the same server
[15:14:04] <zumba_addict> yes, different
[15:14:09] <zumba_addict> cors
[15:14:17] <shoky> ok, IE9 needs somethign special for cors
[15:14:20] <shoky> an xdr transport
[15:14:21] <shoky> hang on
[15:14:25] <zumba_addict> cool
[15:14:36] <zumba_addict> my officemate added cors library but it wasn't helping
[15:14:43] <shoky> include  this  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[15:14:49] <zumba_addict> cool
[15:15:01] <zumba_addict> i'll try it now :D excited!!!
[15:15:07] <shoky> ;]
[15:15:22] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: considering im getting paid no more than €300 to make the site, i think i'll just stick to straight radius for now :) how would you implement? I r nurb
[15:15:46] <zumba_addict> added, trying it now :) cross fingers
[15:16:54] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel: openstreetmaps and then measure from point a to b? I was also thinking about just collecting and cross referencing a list of the area codes that are within the boundaries
[15:17:01] <Mrgoose> sup sup
[15:17:10] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser area codes aren't good for distance measuremant imo.
[15:17:12] <zumba_addict> xdr.js loaded but still getting the same error on the same spot :(
[15:17:23] <duch_kazatel> basiclaser you have to hook into some kind of map api i'm afraid - there's no way for you to know where the user is in relation to the restaurant unless you use an API.
[15:17:32] <shoky> zumba_addict which spot?
[15:17:37] <zumba_addict> this code
[15:17:44] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/ im stuck here, the first one with hide() works, but the others dont becaause baldraw- is a div and deposit- baldrawcont- is a tr, inside a search for a td
[15:17:49] <zumba_addict> json_response = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
[15:17:54] <zumba_addict> responseText is undefined
[15:18:23] <basiclaser> oh dang :( should i jump OSM or google?
[15:18:27] <basiclaser> duch_kazatel:
[15:18:28] <Linkandzelda> dont know why I dont just add an onClick method and pass in the number.. would solve it all
[15:18:30] <duch_kazatel> link that doesn't make any sense.
[15:18:38] <duch_kazatel> link you can pass the number...
[15:18:49] <shoky> zumba_addict can you show the surrounding code
[15:18:57] <duch_kazatel> either way, with what you've got there, put the click handler outside of the loop.
[15:19:04] <zumba_addict> sure
[15:19:13] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/1/
[15:20:10] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: i can say already it wont work how I want it :(
[15:20:24] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda you need to supply the generated markup, not the PHP.
[15:20:32] <zumba_addict> it's a coffeescript/backbonejs shoky - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0aab890937467aa60cd9
[15:20:34] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda i answered your original question.
[15:20:46] <Linkandzelda> you did yea, thanks for that
[15:20:47] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda if you need something else, you need to be specific about what you want.
[15:21:50] <zumba_addict> when I hover the mouse on the code json_response = JSON.parse(response.responseText) in ie debugger, it will say responseText undefined Invalid Character
[15:22:03] <shoky> zumba_addict and are you expecting an error response or not?
[15:22:22] <zumba_addict> no, I was expecting it to pass because it works in Chrome
[15:22:42] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: generated markup fails too in jsfiddle lol
[15:22:49] <zumba_addict> in Chrome, it doesn't go to error. It successfully saves the data to the api backend
[15:22:55] <zumba_addict> but in IE9, it goes to error
[15:22:57] <zumba_addict> it's so weird
[15:23:05] <shoky> zumba_addict have you tried IE10 or 11 ?
[15:23:17] <zumba_addict> i heard from officemate that IE11 works
[15:23:28] <zumba_addict> but boss wants us to fix it for IE9
[15:23:42] <shoky> what are those console.log logging?
[15:23:49] <shoky> hm, console.dir
[15:23:59] <zumba_addict> i was troubleshooting it to see if it contained data and it does
[15:24:04] <zumba_addict> console.dir is for IE
[15:24:22] <zumba_addict> if console.log, it displays it like this [object]
[15:24:27] <shoky> yeah
[15:24:33] <shoky> what data is it loggin?
[15:24:35] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: http://cl.ly/image/0M1d2l1A1c43 this is what it looks like, http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/2/ this is the code it generated in page source. what I need is, for them to be all closed when the page loads (they are) then when the user clicks withdraw/deposit it unhides the elemnt and slides the other in, after that click again it toggles back
[15:24:42] <zumba_addict> I can gist it
[15:24:43] <shoky> the response
[15:24:47] <zumba_addict> one sec
[15:25:27] <zumba_addict> response: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1fbf624a25fdd99761fb
[15:25:40] <shoky> and just makin sure.. you included xdr.js before this code is run, yeah? and you didnt just include the url i gave but copied the code from there, yea? ;p
[15:25:52] <zumba_addict> i don't understand a single thing there
[15:26:00] <zumba_addict> yes, xdr.js is loaded
[15:26:07] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: this is what it should look like after being unhidden http://cl.ly/image/0g0m0m3i0h2h
[15:26:36] <zumba_addict> I wrote it like this, <script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js"></script>
[15:27:01] <shoky> ah
[15:27:02] <shoky> no good
[15:27:18] <shoky> that's a url to a github page
[15:27:20] <zumba_addict> i wrote it bad?
[15:27:26] <zumba_addict> lol
[15:27:28] <zumba_addict> hahaha
[15:27:44] <zumba_addict> you are right, hahahaha
[15:27:46] <zumba_addict> :D
[15:27:47] <shoky> you can try this url https://rawgithub.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/master/src/xdr.js
[15:27:54] <zumba_addict> i got it now using raw
[15:27:57] <zumba_addict> https://raw.github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/master/src/xdr.js
[15:28:02] <zumba_addict> :D
[15:28:07] <shoky> yeah but you cant include that url usually
[15:28:11] <shoky> use mine ;p
[15:28:16] <shoky> or just copy the damn file ;p
[15:28:19] <duch_kazatel> orry had to step away.
[15:28:30] <zumba_addict> very good catch shoky!!!!!!!!
[15:28:33] <zumba_addict> trying it now again
[15:28:37] <shoky> heh
[15:29:01] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda mind reposting what you wanted if you did all ready?
[15:29:26] <zumba_addict> :(
[15:29:32] <zumba_addict> still on the same error
[15:29:37] <zumba_addict> i cleared the cache on IE and reloaded
[15:29:54] <zumba_addict> i went to script tab and make sure i loaded xdr.js, I saw the code
[15:30:09] <shoky> hmf.
[15:30:22] <zumba_addict> OMG, the xdr.js is gone
[15:30:29] <zumba_addict> after I click Submit button
[15:30:37] <Mrgoose> any of you using jquery mobile
[15:30:41] <zumba_addict> this is so f*ing weird
[15:30:50] <zumba_addict> I'll close iE
[15:31:29] <shoky> wait, does backbone even use jquery for ajax?
[15:31:40] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[15:31:49] <shoky> zumba_addict that's something to check i suppose
[15:32:12] <shoky> oh and of course, include xdr.js AFTER jquery
[15:32:45] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda is are you trying to make a tabbed interface?
[15:33:38] <zumba_addict> yup
[15:33:48] <shoky> zumba_addict mm
[15:34:09] <shoky> zumba_addict i see you're calling .save( [], ...
[15:34:14] <shoky> what's this [] ?
[15:34:36] <zumba_addict> it means empty object but I don't know why they put it
[15:34:38] <shoky> shouldn't it be {}  ?
[15:34:43] <shoky> [] is empty array
[15:34:45] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict that's an empty array
[15:34:47] <zumba_addict> yup, array
[15:34:49] <zumba_addict> sorry
[15:35:00] <zumba_addict> not sure why it's there but Chrome isn't affected
[15:35:11] <shoky> that might be the "Invalid argument" IE is yelling about
[15:35:12] <zumba_addict> let me ask backboneJs folks
[15:35:25] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: http://cl.ly/image/0M1d2l1A1c43 this is what it looks like, http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/2/ this is the code it generated in page source. what I need is, for them to be all closed when the page loads (they are) then when the user clicks withdraw/deposit it unhides the elemnt and slides the other in
[15:35:27] <shoky> http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/#Model-save
[15:35:29] <Linkandzelda> did you get this ^
[15:35:37] <shoky> they say attributes is a hash
[15:35:37] <zumba_addict> I'll look
[15:35:38] <shoky> with keys
[15:35:40] <shoky> not an array
[15:36:20] <zumba_addict> k
[15:36:32] <duch_kazatel> yeah i got that Linkandzelda - the second half makes no sense.  "it unhides the the element and slides the other in"?
[15:36:33] <zumba_addict> i'm looking for my gist
[15:36:50] <Linkandzelda> yea sorry i suck at explaining things..
[15:38:11] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda where's this version that "half works"?
[15:38:20] <Linkandzelda> whats going on is, the elemnts with baldraw- ids contain the content, and the one that gets hidden is baldrawcont-, when the user clicks element with deposit- id
[15:38:54] <Linkandzelda> the version I posted on jsfiddle is what I took right out of page source, and that works becuase your original answer of hiding all
[15:39:10] <duch_kazatel> okay, so the first .hide() is working.
[15:40:49] <duch_kazatel> ah, so you want to bind clicks on <td class="balance_inside" id="deposit-2">Deposit / Withdraw</td> to impact <tr id="baldrawcont-2">
[15:41:15] <duch_kazatel> and run your click handler code.  the bidning it going to be a bitch - is there a reason you can't use a class on those TDs?
[15:41:55] <Zzaichik> it looks like the nfl site has fixed its countdown thing
[15:42:18] <Zzaichik> hehe, sorry wrong window.
[15:42:28] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: the class "balance_inside" could be used, as long as it knows what one I clicked on and performs the stuff for the others with the same id number
[15:45:08] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda so a click on ANY TD with the class "balance_inside"? that's a PITA the way you have things now.
[15:46:54] <talntid> anyone know of any html/css/jquery freelance channels?
[15:47:08] <duch_kazatel> talntid probably none on freenode.
[15:47:32] <shoky> there's #css-lance or something
[15:47:50] <shoky> talntid ^
[15:48:47] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: actually, it seems the hiding dowsnt work, it runs constantly so when its opened, it closes instantly
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda err, it doesn't "run constantly".  it runs once.
[15:50:28] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: it runs constantly im 100% sure, one aspect of jquery im not used to
[15:50:32] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/5/ - http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/5/
[15:50:37] <duch_kazatel> err, meant to paste that once.
[15:50:40] <duch_kazatel> it runns the loop once.
[15:50:57] <duch_kazatel> and only once.\
[15:50:59] <Linkandzelda> test it yourself with an alert, it spams unlimited alerts without doing anything
[15:51:12] <Linkandzelda> even after the table fully loads
[15:51:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/5/
[15:51:20] <duch_kazatel> bam done.
[15:51:29] <duch_kazatel> "lol" shows in the console 11 times.
[15:52:11] <Linkandzelda> i see
[15:52:15] <Linkandzelda> well whatever its doing
[15:52:27] <Linkandzelda> it hides it again right after i unhide it
[15:52:36] <duch_kazatel> how are you "unhiding" it?
[15:53:54] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/9/
[15:53:57] <Linkandzelda> code at the bottom
[15:54:10] <Linkandzelda> onClick="toggleView(<? echo $i; ?>);"
[15:54:18] <Linkandzelda> inside the element
[15:54:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/10/
[15:55:44] <duch_kazatel> calling toggleView('1'); after your code in your latest works.
[15:56:14] <Linkandzelda> i dont get it
[15:56:24] <duch_kazatel> what don't you get?
[15:56:30] <duch_kazatel> you're defining a function but never calling it.
[15:56:35] <Linkandzelda> take away the for loop for hiding and it works perfectly
[15:56:37] <duch_kazatel> if I call it, it works.
[15:56:58] <zumba_addict> shoky: I changed [] to {}, it didn't help
[15:58:07] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: im calling it, from onClick
[15:58:32] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda nowhere in the code yopu supplied are you binding to a click.
[15:58:45] <Linkandzelda> [23:54] <Linkandzelda> onClick="toggleView(<? echo $i; ?>);"
[15:59:32] <duch_kazatel> 1: I don't use php.  2: your solution is trying to dynamically generate javascript, which is ugly.  3: inserting javascript to markup is bad bad bad. 4: surround the number with quotes.
[16:00:23] <shoky> zumba_addict: welp unless you have a live link to this.. donno what else to suggest ;p
[16:00:43] <zumba_addict> live link works fine
[16:00:56] <zumba_addict> i'm troubleshooting http://localhost
[16:00:58] <shoky> i mean, a link you can share, so we can see the issue for ourselves
[16:01:17] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: i just worked out the cause, my toggleView doesnt work properly when there's display: none on the element
[16:01:19] <zumba_addict> i have a link but it won't show the issue
[16:01:24] <zumba_addict> it only happens on localhost
[16:01:29] <shoky> huh
[16:01:31] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda you should really reconsider the entire way you have this set up.
[16:01:35] <Linkandzelda> i would do it "properly" but we've proved its not easy to bind the clicks
[16:01:49] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda sure it is, if you do it properly.
[16:01:52] <zumba_addict> localhost is running sinatra
[16:01:58] <Linkandzelda> can you give me a proper example?
[16:02:02] <duch_kazatel> sure, one sec.
[16:02:13] <shoky> zumba_addict so the problem is only when you're connecting to the webserver locally, on IE9 ?
[16:02:16] <zumba_addict> then on environment.rb file, it points our REST api to the remote server in Amazon
[16:02:22] <zumba_addict> yes
[16:02:32] <zumba_addict> and it's affeting our local development
[16:02:35] <zumba_addict> affecting
[16:02:59] <shoky> there might be security settings or some crap affecting it..
[16:03:09] <shoky> you could've mentioned this earlier ;p
[16:03:16] <zumba_addict> I think i did
[16:03:36] <zumba_addict> shoky: zumba_addict: is the request to a different domain? or its all on the same server
[16:03:37] <zumba_addict> [5:14pm] zumba_addict: yes, different
[16:03:44] <zumba_addict> :)
[16:03:54] <shoky> yea.. you didn't say it happens ONLY on localhost
[16:03:59] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[16:04:15] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda where was that onlcick in the markup?  the deposit/withdraw TD?
[16:04:17] <zumba_addict> i think if we host our webserver to another server, it will affect it too
[16:04:26] <zumba_addict> ah
[16:04:27] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: yes
[16:04:30] <zumba_addict> i have an idea :D
[16:04:41] <zumba_addict> i'll change my domain to mimic the remote domain :D
[16:04:48] <zumba_addict> i think that will work
[16:05:34] <duch_kazatel> <table class="hovertable">
[16:05:34] <duch_kazatel>     <tr>

[16:06:00] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaahahahaha fuck me.  Linkandzelda - jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/16/
[16:06:02] <zumba_addict> damn modern.ie vm, it keeps on restarts
[16:06:05] <Linkandzelda> oops lol
[16:06:06] <zumba_addict> restarting
[16:06:43] <zumba_addict> keeps on quitting now. it doesn't want me to try my latest hack that I'm thinking
[16:07:37] <Linkandzelda> oh my, duch_kazatel thats nice exept that the third item isnt working, unless im mistaken
[16:07:58] <Linkandzelda> i see, data-group
[16:08:06] <Linkandzelda> my aproach is very legacy lol
[16:08:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tWnEG/17/
[16:08:15] <duch_kazatel> i mistyped deposit on the third one.
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> now you aren't doing a bunch of unnecessary work.
[16:09:25] <decx> i want to play too ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/3rDSN/
[16:09:32] <Linkandzelda> woooooo, let me implement this and see if it owrks on my side :)
[16:10:09] <duch_kazatel> decx aaahahahaha.  i lol'd.
[16:11:01] <Linkandzelda> heh
[16:11:15] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda fix your markup and be cool.
[16:11:15] <decx> playtime is funtime
[16:11:19] <decx> :>
[16:11:57] <Linkandzelda> i like decx's solution too, except i cant close them after opening
[16:12:03] <Linkandzelda> and no animation
[16:12:25] <duch_kazatel> decx's solution is hacky on purpose.
[16:13:02] <decx> hey i have to work with inflexible markup all the time ;)
[16:13:13] <Linkandzelda> i'm not good enough to know why, but ok, i'll fix my markup :)
[16:14:57] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda because you need to have clear, expressive markup.
[16:15:09] <duch_kazatel> and not have munged javascript.
[16:15:16] <duch_kazatel> when possible, be explicity.
[16:15:18] <duch_kazatel> *explicit
[16:15:33] <steinart1> not sure if i want to know what you guys are up to right now
[16:15:45] <duch_kazatel> a dude was being hacky :)
[16:15:48] <duch_kazatel> all is well now.
[16:15:59] <steinart1> hey, this is js isnt it
[16:16:05] <steinart1> show something not hacky
[16:16:29] <steinart1> if you dont find it hacky, crockford probably does
[16:16:30] <decx> tr[id*=baldrawcont] is AN work of art
[16:16:35] <bluepnume> Is the following javascript code safe? I know you should never do this, I'm just wondering if this is exploitable: eval("'" + user_input.replace("'", "&#39;") + "'');
[16:17:01] <duch_kazatel> bluepnume nope.
[16:17:46] <bluepnume> duch_kazatel: can you show me how you'd execute aribtrary code? I can pass a \n newline into user_input, but then I just get a syntax error
[16:18:00] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: must admit, this is espressive in its own way... https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hubtvb1tg5xzsa/Screen%20Shot%202014-01-18%20at%2000.15.06.png
[16:18:01] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't.
[16:18:30] <steinart1> eeew
[16:18:47] <duch_kazatel> :(
[16:18:54] <duch_kazatel> that makes me sad.  and i work in coldfusion all day.
[16:20:22] <decx> how do you find stuff in there
[16:20:33] <Linkandzelda> dunno
[16:20:58] <Linkandzelda> it takes longer to format it correctly lol
[16:21:41] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda you'll spend minimal extra time up front and spend much less time later.
[16:22:15] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: i know, im not always like this, i just type stuff as if i buffer it out my brain lmao
[16:22:25] <Linkandzelda> its a bad habit, that i'll solve
[16:22:25] <decx> built in minifier ^^
[16:22:37] <steinart1> coding minified
[16:22:48] <decx> no whitespace for you friend !
[16:23:04] <steinart1> if i ever meet someone like that, i'll start as a lawnmower in sheer awe
[16:26:49] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: ok, updated my code to use the new markup, back to the same instant hiding problem...
[16:27:04] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda huh
[16:27:05] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:27:09] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda code
[16:28:24] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda do not use those onclicks - use my event binding instead.
[16:28:39] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: code is identical to yours
[16:28:51] <Linkandzelda> i litterally copied and pasted it in
[16:28:51] <duch_kazatel> no, it's not.
[16:29:08] <Linkandzelda> filled out the number fields with my php outputs
[16:29:09] <duch_kazatel> rendered markup + javascript in fiddle please.
[16:32:36] <duch_kazatel> because the code i supplied works.
[16:33:03] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/cmVtL/
[16:33:20] <Linkandzelda> i know it works inside the fiddle, your one, i guess ive missed something tohugh I cant see it
[16:33:36] <duch_kazatel> </th class="market_list-title"> - that's ivalid btw.
[16:33:49] <duch_kazatel> *invalid
[16:34:38] <Linkandzelda> it is?
[16:34:49] <duch_kazatel> a class on a closing tag?  yeah.
[16:34:51] <Linkandzelda> oh, i see it
[16:34:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/cmVtL/1/  this works.  not sure what you're doing.  maybe make sure your js is loading after the markup?  put it in a document ready.
[16:35:41] <Hilton> .toggle(), .show() and .hide() switch between inline styles display: none; and display: (insert previous display type here). Is there a way to make it so that it simply REMOVES the inline display rule on .show()? I have some elements which change display based on screen width, and some people apparently resize their display which gets it completely screwed up.
[16:36:02] <duch_kazatel> Hilton use .css() instead of those.
[16:39:07] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: this is the issue I was talking about https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxjleudmihtc3i1/qq.mp4
[16:39:21] <duch_kazatel> wait why are you linking me to an MP4?
[16:39:43] <duch_kazatel> css plox.
[16:39:58] <decx> well now i'm curious but apprehensive
[16:40:13] <duch_kazatel> because that initial hide function only runs once.
[16:40:38] <Linkandzelda> http://jsfiddle.net/cmVtL/5/ added css in here
[16:40:50] <tomslominski> Hi. When writing code, should I be prefixing my selectors with jQuery, for compatibility reasons, or should I just use $?
[16:40:52] <decx> hilton instead of hide show, use classes with css media queries for the responsive stuff
[16:41:12] <duch_kazatel> tomslominski use $
[16:41:33] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda still works flawlessly for me.
[16:41:47] <bluepnume> js injection question on stackoverflow, would appreciate any insight: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21198402
[16:41:51] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: the one I linked you isnt working lol
[16:41:51] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda wait are you using jqueryui?
[16:41:55] <decx> that fiddle doesnt work for me
[16:41:57] <Linkandzelda> yes duch_kazatel
[16:42:11] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda I had to enable jquery and jquery ui on my own.
[16:42:14] <duch_kazatel> i see te brokwn now.
[16:42:15] <tomslominski> duch_kazatel: alright, thanks :) the only problem I noticed with it is working with multiple frameworks/wordpress, but I guess if someone wants to reuse my code they can fix that.
[16:42:26] <tomslominski> pretty simply.
[16:42:29] <duch_kazatel> tomslominski wait "multiple frameworks"?
[16:43:05] <tomslominski> duch_kazatel: well, not that I'd do that. but for example in WordPress jQuery is modified so that you have to specifically refer to jQuery rather than just $
[16:43:10] <tomslominski> I think, anyway.
[16:43:32] <duch_kazatel> tomslominski you could also wrap all your code in IIFEs that let you shortcut to $
[16:44:00] <decx> yeah some theme devs a few years ago liked to use prototype and jquery and mootools and yui all at the same time
[16:44:02] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda if I comment out $( "#baldraw-" + i ).toggle('slide',{direction:'up'},100); it works fine.
[16:44:18] <tomslominski> duch_kazatel: I suppose. I'm only starting out with JS, so I suppose changing $ to jQuery isn't that bad if the code is only like 30 lines with comments and spacing. thanks :)
[16:44:25] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: basically my animation gone... lol
[16:44:50] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda that's where your problem will be.
[16:45:13] <duch_kazatel> that version of toggle looks wrong to me.
[16:45:57] <Linkandzelda> hmm, i was messing about with hard coded ids
[16:46:00] <Linkandzelda> and it worked then
[16:46:14] <Linkandzelda> this was a few hours ago, so i didnt consider the toggle was wrong
[16:47:06] <decx> there's slideToggle() btw
[16:47:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah use that instead mang.
[16:47:53] <decx> but it looks nicer and is better if you add a class and do the animation stuff with css3
[16:49:57] <Eliade> Hi everyone
[16:50:22] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: on your updated fiddle, change it to $("#baldraw-" + i).slideToggle("slow");
[16:50:31] <Linkandzelda> and change the 85 to 850
[16:50:40] <Linkandzelda> watch madness happen in slow mo
[16:50:48] <duch_kazatel> i know exactly what happening all ready.
[16:51:54] <duch_kazatel> your animations are all fucked up.
[16:52:18] <Eliade> I've got a problem with the animate function of Jquery.
[16:52:18] <Eliade> I use it to scroll content (img + text)  in a div, and it's jerky (is it the term ? i'm not fluent in english)
[16:52:48] <Eliade> Under firefox it works pretty fine but in chrome ... awful
[16:53:07] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: yea, but why and how can I fix it? :D
[16:53:10] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda http://jsfiddle.net/cmVtL/8/
[16:53:17] <duch_kazatel> you're hiding one, then toggling styles.
[16:53:25] <duch_kazatel> so you need to clean up what you're hiding and showing.
[16:53:32] <duch_kazatel> there are your problems in a nutshell.
[16:53:57] * Linkandzelda le gasp
[16:54:16] <Linkandzelda> it works, thank you... im not used to using jquery or animation so its all new to me
[16:54:27] <duch_kazatel> your issue wasn't animating, it was toggling.
[16:54:41] <Eliade> I see i'm not the only one with animation problem
[16:54:52] <Linkandzelda> OH
[16:54:53] <duch_kazatel> Eliade do you have a jsfiddle?
[16:54:55] <Linkandzelda> i get it
[16:55:02] <Eliade> No but i can do it
[16:55:08] <duch_kazatel> Eliade please do then :)
[16:55:12] <Linkandzelda> baldrawcont was NOT hidden at the start of the page
[16:55:17] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel you are a genius
[16:55:17] <Eliade> i use code pen, but no problem
[16:55:33] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda are you familiar with firebug/chrome's dev tools?
[16:55:55] <Linkandzelda> duch_kazatel: i know basic inspect elemnt stuff, thats about it. i use it for css debugging
[16:56:19] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda you should use it to watch what's happning to your markup in realtime.
[16:56:29] <duch_kazatel> that's how I figured it out - watching inline styles getting applied.
[16:56:34] <Linkandzelda> oooo
[16:56:36] <Linkandzelda> i see
[16:57:44] <Linkandzelda> thanks duch_kazatel and decx for your help and advice :)
[16:57:53] <Linkandzelda> no doubht i'll be popping in and out of here
[16:58:12] <duch_kazatel> Linkandzelda of course - it's all about the pursuit of knowledge.
[17:00:34] <decx> np linkandzelda
[17:02:44] <sabotender> does jquery provide a method of file upload progress?
[17:04:00] <duch_kazatel> sabotender not by default.
[17:04:21] <sabotender> ah
[17:04:25] <duch_kazatel> sabotender you'd need to find a plugin to do it that'll work with your backend.
[17:04:34] <sabotender> i see
[17:13:45] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[17:14:32] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, are you here ?
[17:14:38] <duch_kazatel> indeed i am.
[17:15:30] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, so the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/eliade/V47ux/ , but ... i'm so frustrated 'cause it works but on my website ... it doesn't work
[17:16:09] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, the black squares are button to go up or down
[17:17:15] <duch_kazatel> make surew you update your fiddle and send the new link.
[17:17:19] <duch_kazatel> i don't see the black squares.
[17:18:21] <decx> why does jsfiddle not accept img without /> it's "html5" in the options
[17:18:38] <decx> these red closing tags hurt
[17:18:40] <decx> :D
[17:18:44] <duch_kazatel> because it's parsing as if it were XML.
[17:19:08] <Eliade> so sorry ... http://jsfiddle.net/eliade/V47ux/1/
[17:19:28] <decx> oh right
[17:19:42] <Eliade> but on my website ... it's just a mess
[17:19:53] <duch_kazatel> Eliade err... i still don't see them... either way, you said it's jerky:?
[17:20:00] <decx> i dont see them either
[17:20:17] <Eliade> i will try something else ... don't move ! ;)
[17:20:24] <duch_kazatel> Eliade either way, you shouldn't use margins for this.
[17:20:42] <duch_kazatel> Eliade check out the CSS overflow property and jquery's scroll() method.
[17:20:46] <decx> yeah use scrollTo and the offsett
[17:21:20] <decx> oh off course we dont see black squares
[17:21:28] <decx> it's empty image tags without alt
[17:21:30] <decx> :>
[17:21:33] <duch_kazatel> i know why we don't see them ;)
[17:21:35] <Eliade> http://jsfiddle.net/eliade/V47ux/2/
[17:21:54] <docStorm> Raaaaainbows!
[17:21:57] <duch_kazatel> part of the problem is likely all the extra computations surrounding.
[17:22:09] <duch_kazatel> Eliade use overflow: scroll;
[17:22:09] <Eliade> what do you call extra computations ?
[17:22:40] <duch_kazatel> the browser has to recalculate how to draw everything.
[17:23:12] <Eliade> Mh ok, i just want to scroll 150px each time you click to scroll the news
[17:23:39] <Eliade> i'm sorry, i begin in jquery ...
[17:23:39] <duch_kazatel> Eliade again, go take a look at the overflow CSS property.  then look at jquery's .scroll() method.
[17:23:45] <decx> also buttons for scrolling are a decade out of fashion, people know how to scroll and the ones who don't are swiping
[17:23:49] <duch_kazatel> use those together and you'll have what you want.
[17:24:13] <Eliade> decx, yes but i don't decide for the web design
[17:24:26] <Eliade> Thank you duch_kazatel i will take a look
[17:24:29] <decx> well then the person deciding should be talked to :>
[17:24:59] <Eliade> decx, i convince her to change a lot of  old habits, but buttons she wants them
[17:25:18] <decx> designers
[17:25:45] <decx> eyerolling so hard i get vertigo
[17:26:02] <duch_kazatel> so glad our designers aren't dumb.
[17:26:23] <decx> as a former "designerfool" i can feel the pain of all teh backend programmers that have to deal with them :>
[17:27:00] <duch_kazatel> our backend guys only listen to the other developers.  most of our designers only work with what they have available.  if they want something new/different, they have to ask for it.
[17:27:16] <duch_kazatel> he separate our concerns 3 levels - backend, middleware, and front.
[17:27:25] <tw2113> and the divide between designers and devs remain
[17:27:50] <duch_kazatel> yes.  we have developers implement.  some designers code here, but they don't have free reign.
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> works really well for us.
[17:29:26] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, you mean scrolltop() for jquery ? or just scroll() ?
[17:30:03] <duch_kazatel> i mean just scroll().  but you need to setup your container with the overflow css property first.
[17:31:24] <Eliade> ok, but i thought scroll() was to do an action when there is a scroll ... not to create a scroll
[17:31:31] <armyriad> How come the jQuery click event is not fired when a button is focused and I press the spacebar?
[17:31:35] <mwizard> Guys, where can I post a bug/fix for jsDump? It's part of QUnit, but I'm not sure if it's upstream or separate branch
[17:31:47] <duch_kazatel> Eliade that's why you need the css overflow property.
[17:32:01] <duch_kazatel> armyriad because you're not clicking on the button.
[17:32:26] <duch_kazatel> armyriad you're pressing spacebar.
[17:32:28] <armyriad> duch_kazatel: The click event is triggered when I press the Enter key however.
[17:32:37] <duch_kazatel> armyriad what's the event binding?
[17:32:47] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, i feel dumb, but ... when you click on something how the animate process do if there is no ... animate action ? sorry to bother you :/
[17:32:53] <armyriad> Why does the Enter key trigger the click event but not the spacebar?
[17:33:05] <decx> now that's a good question :>
[17:33:18] <duch_kazatel> Eliade by using scroll.
[17:33:40] <duch_kazatel> or rather scrollTo()
[17:34:01] <Eliade> duch_kazatel, ok i'll test that i think i need to sleep right now, my brain is off
[17:34:09] <Eliade> Again thank you for all
[17:34:34] <duch_kazatel> armyriad have some code to share?
[17:36:10] <decx> bind click and keypress for keyCode 32
[17:36:23] <decx> can you do that with on anyway?
[17:36:32] <decx> like on('click, keypress')
[17:36:40] <duch_kazatel> decx he's saying it's triggering the click - he doesn't want it to, and yes you can do that.
[17:36:55] <decx> wait he doesnt want to
[17:37:01] <decx> well it's late
[17:37:02] <decx> ^^
[17:38:05] <armyriad> duch_kazatel: Here's the code I'm using right now. It's very basic. http://codetidy.com/7810/
[17:38:28] <axscode> hi guys, i have this problem... i tried this http://jsfiddle.net/ and its working .live('change', function(){}) while http://baby.hatchlinkjr.com/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E6%94%AF%E6%89%95%E3%81%84%EF%BC%88paypal%EF%BC%89 its not working  event change on select. somethings stoping it is there anyway i can bind on change event even there's already binding into i
[17:38:32] <duch_kazatel> armyriad can you setup a functioning example on jsfiddle
[17:38:58] <zumba_addict> here is what I've learned from troubleshooting IE9. It uses Xdomain request and IE0 doesn't know how to send json. It sends data as uri part
[17:39:01] <zumba_addict> am I right?
[17:39:20] <zumba_addict> s/IE0/IE9
[17:39:57] <Eliade> bye :)
[17:41:23] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:47:44] <shoky> zumba_addict it knows how to send json..
[17:47:53] <zumba_addict> yup, i found a code
[17:47:56] <zumba_addict> i see the issue now
[17:48:22] <zumba_addict> our api doesn't accept POST with data like firstname=Scott&lastname=Dave
[17:48:30] <zumba_addict> it only accepts json
[17:48:42] <shoky> what does that have to do with IE9?
[17:49:02] <zumba_addict> the cors library is converting it to that, I'll have to remove it
[17:49:21] <zumba_addict> it's not the xdr.js. It's the backbone.crossdomain.js
[17:50:23] <shoky> yea i thought backbone might be overriding jquery's ajax
[17:50:30] <zumba_addict> i am still wondering why xdr.js is not being used
[17:50:31] <duch_kazatel> aaaaa
[17:50:47] <zumba_addict> i mean, when debugging, it doesn't go inside xdr.js
[17:51:05] <zumba_addict> it goes inside backbone.crossdomain.js when Backbone.sync is called
[17:51:09] <shoky> you don't need any js lib for cors, except xdr.js for ie9
[17:51:24] <shoky> donno what backbone.crossdomain.js is but i doubt you need it
[17:51:29] <zumba_addict> i'll remove the other cors library that officemate put
[17:51:44] <zumba_addict> i'll try removing both and leave xdr.js
[17:54:18] <shoky> oh seems that backbone one is just for adding xdr too
[17:55:20] <ShawnRisk> how do I make this code, http://pastebin.com/mcihtRbr show the div #fixed-header as 60px when this shows up and 22px when I slideUp the div and back to 60px when I slideDown?
[17:55:47] <duch_kazatel> $('#fixed-header').css(); instead of show and hide.
[17:56:15] <duch_kazatel> or animate() if that's your thing.
[17:57:13] <ShawnRisk> why?
[17:57:39] <decx> i assuume you want a sticky header?
[17:57:51] <duch_kazatel> because you're not trying to hide/show the header.
[17:58:00] <duch_kazatel> you want to change its height.  those are two different things.
[17:58:31] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes I am, if I have scrolled beyond 113 show header, and if it isn't hide header
[17:58:36] <ShawnRisk> decx: yes
[17:59:02] <duch_kazatel> "show the div #fixed-header as 60px when this shows up and 22px when I slideUp the div and back to 60px when I slideDown?" so then this is inaccurate?  i'm very confused about what you mean.
[17:59:22] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/pZT9n/
[17:59:37] <decx> use a class instead of a hidden element
[17:59:56] <decx> thats my basic sticky snippet
[18:00:00] <ShawnRisk> live example, http://www.ecosanity.org/blogsanity/ scroll down after page loads.
[18:00:08] <nahtnam> Hey!
[18:01:25] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: that is not inaccurate just at all.  I am not sure what you are confused about.
[18:02:14] <duch_kazatel> that description said nothing about hiding anything, that's all.  was trying to figure out what you want.  'swhy i usually ask for a working fiddle.
[18:02:17] <duch_kazatel> that's all.
[18:02:49] <axscode> hi guys, i have this problem... i tried this http://jsfiddle.net/ and its working .live('change', function(){}) while http://baby.hatchlinkjr.com/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E6%94%AF%E6%89%95%E3%81%84%EF%BC%88paypal%EF%BC%89 its not working  event change on select. somethings stoping it is there anyway i can bind on change event even there's already binding into i
[18:02:52] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: Did you see the live example?
[18:03:07] <decx> use my script, if you scroll over the further than the specified numbe, the element toggles the sticky class
[18:03:32] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk nope :)  just sayin' broseph.  no trying to attack you.
[18:03:38] <duch_kazatel> *not
[18:03:39] <decx> well not my script, i had the same question and found in on stack  a while ago :>
[18:03:57] <decx> it*
[18:04:02] <decx> dat writing at 3
[18:04:04] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: would you look at that?
[18:04:27] <duch_kazatel> so you want the fixed header they're got there.
[18:04:37] <duch_kazatel> did decx show you what you want?
[18:05:19] <ShawnRisk> nope
[18:05:44] <duch_kazatel> mmk, one sec.
[18:06:13] <zumba_addict> shoky, this is where it exits out and gives a 401 or 403 error, var xhr = options.xhr = Backbone.ajax(_.extend(params, options));
[18:06:54] <shoky> zumba_addict ok.. 401 or 403 means you got a response from the server, so no cross-domain issue
[18:07:01] <decx> i did :o
[18:07:05] <zumba_addict> yup
[18:07:10] <zumba_addict> that is really good news
[18:07:26] <zumba_addict> now, i'm figuring out why IE is saying Invalid character
[18:07:45] <Cam> I use / to trigger focus on an input but I can't get the "/" to be erased from the input even if I try $(id).val('')
[18:08:14] <zumba_addict> f*ck!!! The vm that I downloaded from modern.ie shuts down again. Looks like there is a tiemr
[18:08:15] <zumba_addict> timer
[18:08:24] <decx> check it ShawnRisk http://jsfiddle.net/pZT9n/1/
[18:08:25] <zumba_addict> i was about to figure out the issue
[18:08:30] <zumba_addict> gheez
[18:08:41] <zumba_addict> i'll eat first, lol
[18:08:59] <duch_kazatel> crap, i'm going to have to head out.  good luck folks.
[18:09:00] <duch_kazatel> enjoy./
[18:09:27] <ShawnRisk> decx: yours doesn't collapse or expand
[18:11:38] <decx> yeah that's just the basic logic for the sticky header, you wanna do all the animation in the sticky class
[18:11:47] <decx> with transitions
[18:12:18] <decx> that's much faster on mobile devices
[18:12:27] <decx> performance wise
[18:12:54] <ShawnRisk> decx: what is wrong with my code and can't this be fixed to do the collapse and expand?
[18:13:53] <decx> i'm just telling you that animation is faster with css rules :>
[18:14:03] <decx> havent looked at the code in your url yet
[18:14:42] <ShawnRisk> decx: oh my.  I tried with css and failed so I tried with jQuery and failed too.  This is why I came in here
[18:15:24] <decx> also if you embed that many youtube videos on one page you should use the iframe api
[18:15:47] <decx> it's killing performance to load all the separate youtube scripts multiple times
[18:16:03] <decx> https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#IFrame_Player_API
[18:16:26] <ShawnRisk> okay I will look into that
[18:17:04] <decx> damn i dont understand that sentence either
[18:17:12] <decx> no wonder duch_kazatel had to go :D
[18:17:22] <decx>  "show the div #fixed-header as 60px when this shows up and 22px when I slideUp the div and back to 60px when I slideDown?"
[18:18:10] <decx> so when you are on top on the page the fixed header is 22px high and overlayed over the normal header
[18:18:23] <decx> and when you scroll down beyond the normal header it grows to 60
[18:18:28] <ShawnRisk> no
[18:18:38] <decx> shit that made so much sense in my brain
[18:18:40] <decx> :D
[18:19:22] <ShawnRisk> When the fixed header shows I want this to be 60px, and when I click the minus button, this shrinks to 22px, and then pressing the + makes this grow back to 60px
[18:19:36] <decx> oh so there's a button involved
[18:19:58] <ShawnRisk> if you look at my jquery code you will see what I am doing.
[18:20:07] <decx> yeah i just noticed the button
[18:29:36] <decx> where is it ShawnRisk?
[18:29:44] <decx> ah
[18:29:48] <decx> hideheader.js
[18:30:11] <ShawnRisk> decx: yes but I pasted this in pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/mcihtRbr
[18:30:11] <igcewieling> I'm looking for ideas on where to start, even just search terms would be helpful.   I want to take the contents of an element, such as a <div> which contains other elements like a table and sent hand it off to my script using an ajax call.   Since it isn't a form I'm not sure where I should start.
[18:30:29] <decx> why are you changing css width and not height? i thought height
[18:30:54] <ShawnRisk> decx: oh oops brain fart
[18:34:58] <ShawnRisk> decx: thanks that fixed this
[18:35:34] <ShawnRisk> decx: I have a css question, can I pm you on that?
[18:35:44] <decx> sure

When I use html = $('#call_list table').inlineStyler().html() I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'html' of undefined " can anyone help?
[20:45:56] <igcewieling> Am I confused about chaining or could it be an issue with the plugin?
