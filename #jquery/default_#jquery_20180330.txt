[02:51:54] <jak2000> hi all
[08:04:23] <Neo4> Hi
[08:05:37] <Neo4> I'm thinking about whether worth create chat on php + jquery. and how much people it can keep...
[09:36:18] <daveomcd> is there a jquery function that will convert my interger to "human form" . so if I pass it "1" it will show "One" or "2000" to "Two Thousand" ?
[10:19:03] <TitaniumLeg> How would I set dropdownParent of an existing Select2?
[10:19:53] <bRinbg> gives for jquery a datacontroller like react for better interactive websites?
[10:44:54] <MikeD_> human form numbers - heh
[12:06:50] <TitaniumLeg> Any way to prevent Select2 from loading everything from an ajax source into the Dom?
[12:52:55] <dimi1947> I want to see what values of my form gets serialized...the result is this form%5B0%5D%5Bservice%5D=no&price_show0=1&price_show1=1   ...is there any way I can make this string more meaningfull?
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> all your form inputs get serialized...
[12:53:25] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by "meaningful"
[12:54:51] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:first of all...I think,from a form,only the inputs with a name attribute gets to be serialized....am I correct?
[12:54:56] <Guest26877> he want meaning
[12:54:56] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ -> "Note: Only "successful controls" are serialized to the string. No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button. For a form element's value to be included in the serialized string, the element must have a name attribute. Values from checkboxes and radio buttons (inputs of type "radio" or "checkbox") are included only if
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> they are checked. Data from file select elements is not serialized."
[13:03:37] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that make sense?
[13:03:58] <dimi1947> yes
[15:28:24] <braindead_> hello gurus. i am using this jquery code to hide a div on ratio button state which is working fine: https://jsfiddle.net/jce4r5ra/
[15:29:06] <braindead_> but i want to hide the div by default because the ratio button is on "hide state" by default
[15:29:31] <braindead_> is there a way i could not only check when its change but also on initial load?
[15:38:03] <robertmaxrees> braindead_ there are two wais.
[15:38:25] <robertmaxrees> braindead_ the "right" way would be to modify your markup, css, and js to use a "hide" class.
[15:38:45] <braindead_> i am using a hide class. "hide-this"
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> right, but you're using .toggle() to hide or show.
[15:41:43] <robertmaxrees> the class itself should determine that instead.
[15:43:29] <braindead_> oh. you are right.. its working when i set to display:none by default :)
[15:43:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:43:43] <braindead_> problem solved. thanks :)
[15:43:48] <robertmaxrees> yep
[15:45:32] <sunrunner20> nub question. I've got an AJAX request thats returning the JSON: "["A","B"]" and I'm trying to loop over it in the success function of the AJAX call but none of my googling has turned up anything that works
[15:45:39] <sunrunner20> worse some of it is contradictory
[15:46:11] <sunrunner20> loop over it and add it to a dropdown list
[15:46:27] <robertmaxrees> sunrunner20 show us what you've got so far?
[15:47:26] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be awesome :)
[15:47:34] <sunrunner20> fiddle?
[15:47:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[15:47:45] <robertmaxrees> or any other paste service.
[15:47:46] <sunrunner20> oh
[15:50:50] <sunrunner20> https://pastebin.com/A4jWvxnA
[15:51:16] <sunrunner20> never used jsfiddle before and couldn't find where it generates a link... I'll have to look at that this weekend
[15:51:17] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[15:51:19] <robertmaxrees> check out console
[15:51:28] <robertmaxrees> you should see an error.
[15:51:47] <sunrunner20> but I have no idea how to fix it
[15:51:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:51:56] <sunrunner20> I know the data.each is wrong
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> but what's the error? :)
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> because you want forEach
[15:52:12] <robertmaxrees> "each" is for jquery objects.
[15:52:21] <robertmaxrees> but your server is returning JSON, which isn't a jquery object.
[15:52:57] <sunrunner20> ...
[15:53:01] <sunrunner20> really?
[15:53:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:53:08] <sunrunner20> it was a damned capital E?
[15:53:17] <sunrunner20> I tried foreach first
[15:53:23] <robertmaxrees> the majority of javascript methods are camelcased, yes.
[15:53:25] <sunrunner20> thanks
[15:53:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[15:53:41] <sunrunner20> yea I haven't touched js in 15 years until a few weeks ago
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:14:47] <Guest26877> (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:19:28] <cannap> Hu
[19:30:03] <anteac> Hey, I've been trying to make this dutch postal code validator to work with jquery, but it's giving errors if you change the postal code after entering both a valid postal code and housenumber, because then the housenumber doesnt exist under that new postal code in the API. here is my code https://pastebin.com/BtAGUrPm
[19:31:19] <robertmaxrees> anteac what's with the separate handler for just the postal code input?
[19:34:35] <anteac> the bottom part?
[19:34:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah/.
[19:34:49] <robertmaxrees> the keyup handler.
[19:34:54] <robertmaxrees> (just trying to wrap my head around the problem.
[19:35:45] <anteac> that's just validating the postal code format
[19:35:52] <anteac> i think
[19:37:43] <anteac> basicly my problem: i have 2 fields for postal code and housenumber
[19:37:43] <robertmaxrees> also: you can't redeclare a var like that.
[19:37:54] <robertmaxrees> can only do var housenumber once.
[19:38:13] <anteac> i want it to ping the api only when both fields are filled
[19:39:24] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting this to work on your server?
[19:39:49] <robertmaxrees> i ask because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r32puwk2/
[19:39:54] <robertmaxrees> this is throwing cors errors for m3e.
[19:40:11] <robertmaxrees> ah looks like you usually have a key.
[19:41:10] <anteac> ye
[19:42:32] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?  you enter a valid zip and number, then when you enter a different zip - what happens?
[19:42:41] <robertmaxrees> it clears both the inputs?
[19:43:39] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out the error case you're battling.
[19:44:07] <anteac> i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'postcode' of undefined     at Object.success
[19:44:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, easy.
[19:44:30] <anteac> if i change the postal code
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> you're doing result._embedded.addresses["0"].postcode - you cannot assume that the object will always be defined to that level.
[19:45:10] <anteac> can i wildcard that
[19:45:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:45:33] <robertmaxrees> try a console.log(result) - what does that object look like in that case?
[19:45:45] <robertmaxrees> is there a "hasMatch" or similar property in the data that comes back?
[19:46:38] <anteac> If i enter the postal code, there are multiple address results from the api
[19:46:58] <robertmaxrees> but does it match the format you had before?
[19:47:39] <robertmaxrees> 'cause the issue is the 0th object in result._embedded.addresses diesn't have that property on it.
[19:49:12] <anteac> https://i.imgur.com/uLSBGvj.png
[19:50:06] <robertmaxrees> right, now what about a case where it errors?
[19:50:15] <anteac> so basicly if I enter the postalcode, api gives all possible addresses
[19:50:33] <robertmaxrees> oh also
[19:50:41] <robertmaxrees> if (result._embedded.addresses["0"] that should be a [0] at the end
[19:52:21] <anteac> then when I enter a housenumber that doesnt exist under that postalcode I get this https://i.imgur.com/eFN8q2D.png
[19:52:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:52:43] <robertmaxrees> so that means the object doesn't match the format.,
[19:52:56] <robertmaxrees> try JSON.stringify(result._embedded);
[19:53:09] <robertmaxrees> or just JSON.stringify(result.);
[19:53:14] <robertmaxrees> err, JSON.stringify(result);
[19:55:02] <anteac> where do I have to place that
[19:55:42] <robertmaxrees> sorry - should have been clearer
[19:55:43] <robertmaxrees> console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
[19:56:59] <robertmaxrees> that lets you see everything in the object as a string.
[19:57:10] <robertmaxrees> can copy/paste that into your editor and look at it from there.
[19:57:56] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, https://i.imgur.com/6KEgP0R.png you can click this arrow without that JSON.stringify version and look from there.
[20:00:28] <anteac> yeah it does succesful calls when the postalcode+housenumber combination are legit
[20:00:55] <robertmaxrees> right.  and then the format changes when you hit that error.
[20:01:11] <robertmaxrees> which is why you need to see what the format is in that error case.
[20:02:04] <cannap> result._embedded.addresses["0"].postcode  did you try result._embedded.addresses[0].postcode
[20:02:26] <robertmaxrees> cannap ['0'] actually does function with arrays :)
[20:02:27] <cannap> so postcode is a integer or a string?
[20:02:47] <cannap> because you check the result postcode against a string
[20:02:48] <cannap> ah no
[20:02:51] <robertmaxrees> since array indices are actually object properties with some sppecial handlings.
[20:02:58] <robertmaxrees> *special handlers
[20:02:58] <cannap> you just have "==" not "===="
[20:03:00] <cannap> nvm
[20:03:05] <anteac> yes i removed all of the ''
[20:03:16] <cannap> *===
[20:03:17] <robertmaxrees> issue is the return object format changes between cases.
[20:03:20] <cannap> nvm  forgot what i say
[20:04:08] <cannap> but yea in that screenshot
[20:04:10] <cannap> i cant see postcode
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> in the one with the error?
[20:04:33] <cannap> yes
[20:04:41] <robertmaxrees> because he doesn't have the object expanded.
[20:04:57] <cannap> hmm chrome shows more than 2 props
[20:04:57] <robertmaxrees> it's still returning an object, just not the same "spec", so-to-speak
[20:05:12] <cannap> ah
[20:05:25] <cannap> nvm
[20:05:31] <anteac> the objects that weren't expanded in the error pic were succesful calls
[20:05:35] <cannap> i always thread _ as privae stuff
[20:05:40] <cannap> you should not access
[20:05:42] <cannap> private*
[20:05:51] <robertmaxrees> cannap 3rd party api it looks like
[20:06:09] <robertmaxrees> anteac the one right before the error would be the one that's failing.
[20:06:29] <robertmaxrees> since you're doing console.log(response); and then the ajax call.
[20:06:34] <robertmaxrees> errr, accessing that bad path*
[20:10:50] <anteac> https://i.imgur.com/VJZbUdB.png
[20:11:29] <anteac> here im changed the housenumber from 3 (legit) to 4 (doesnt exist under this postal code range)
[20:14:08] <cannap> so
[20:14:47] <cannap> what you get when you just console.log( result._embedded.addresses)
[20:15:12] <cannap> so
[20:15:16] <cannap> thats you problem
[20:15:20] <cannap> the result is just empty^^
[20:15:29] <cannap> nothing found handle the case
[20:15:35] <cannap> to solve the problem :P
[20:15:49] <cannap> does the api return 404?
[20:15:54] <cannap> when nothing found
[20:16:03] <cannap> a api in 2018 should do this
[20:16:06] <cannap> when they care
[20:16:35] <anteac> nope
[20:16:38] <anteac> ;/
[20:17:04] <cannap> so now
[20:17:57] <cannap> you can do if( result._embedded.addresses.length !== 0) { all fine } else { what ever nothing found}
[20:18:12] <cannap> when you know addresses is always defined
[20:18:20] <cannap> when not it will throw undefined
[20:19:00] <cannap> when _embedded is not defined and you try to access addresses it will throw an error since you cant check undefined in undefined
[20:24:35] <anteac> but 0 is legit
[20:25:06] <cannap> yea i dont know that api
[20:25:39] <anteac> if its empty it gives an error
[20:25:49] <cannap> yea
[20:25:59] <cannap> because its empty and you try to access postcode
[20:27:57] <anteac> would this help if(result._embedded.addresses.length >= 0) { all fine } else { what ever nothing found}
[20:32:09] <cannap> > 0
[20:32:20] <cannap> because when its 0 there is no postalcode to access
[21:37:52] <angell> Hello. When using reset(), I notice it deletes the values of radiobuttons. Is this normal?
[22:03:56] <angell> nevermind, I fixed it
