[09:05:56] <uniqdom> Hello, I have a jquery request that seems to not be working. I don't see the request in Firefox's Network Monitor. What could be the problem? http://paste.debian.net/1073592/
[09:07:48] <uniqdom> the code execution goes until line 37, because I see "We are here" in the console, but I don't see "We are in." message, line 40
[09:15:46] <Cork> uniqdom: your code doesn't thke into account that $.get is async
[09:16:11] <Cork> so getValues will run before $.get has set locked to true
[09:17:02] <Cork> also if you don't get the success callback from get it generally means you have an error from the server
[09:17:18] <Cork> try adding a .fail(function() {}) callback to the $.get call
[09:20:24] <uniqdom> Cork: I'm nearly sure that the code is taking account that $.get is async
[09:20:45] <Cork> ya, that is what i said
[09:21:15] <uniqdom> you said "doesn't"
[09:21:16] <Cork> you set a global value but it will run indepentent of the $.get call, as the callback that sets the value doesn't block
[09:21:26] <Cork> "doesn't take into account" ya
[09:22:19] <Cork> uniqdom: i would recommend writing that as a setTimeout call instead and using deferred to process the answer from the server and queue the next request instead
[09:22:30] <Cork> then you know you have the value changes before you check again
[11:24:17] <pk> where can i get the best jquery project as i am beginner and learning jquery by jquery documentation only

[11:28:46] <pk> i mean i started learning jquery  and i get quiet confortable but only thing i am lacking it to use by code on something
[11:30:03] <undefined_bob> pk: if you want something interactive, I liked https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery
[11:30:13] <robertmaxrees> pk just pick something to build./
[11:30:17] <robertmaxrees> and then build it.
[11:30:28] <pk> thankyou  will sure refer it

[11:32:52] <undefined_bob> but a fluffy one, please
[11:33:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:33:46] <bgilbert_> how can i defeat a trap focus that I don't control? Some other script I can't edit traps focus of an element. Is there anything in jquery/javascript I could do to prevent this?
[11:34:03] <robertmaxrees> "traps focus" meaning....?
[11:34:20] <bgilbert_> like some scripts have some stuff so that if you click off their element, they force the focus back on their element
[11:34:23] <bgilbert_> things like modals
[11:34:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to remove whatever handler is doing that.
[11:35:03] <bgilbert_> i can't control that javascript :(
[11:35:08] <robertmaxrees> which is gonna be hard because that generally means you'd have to remove all handlers for that event.
[11:35:20] <robertmaxrees> if the handlers were bound with jquery, you can use .off()
[11:35:34] <robertmaxrees> but i would avoid that.  why are you trying to remove js you don't control?
[11:36:02] <bgilbert_> its on an ecommerce platform where we don't control everything, so some other plugin/ theme file does crazy shit
[11:36:25] <robertmaxrees> is it a paid platform?
[11:36:31] <bgilbert_> yes
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> then contact their customer support and work through it with them :)
[11:37:32] <bgilbert_> since most people never update their themes it would be broken on like 90% of themes lmao
[11:37:46] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:37:55] <robertmaxrees> wut?
[11:37:59] <bgilbert_> this is Shopify
[11:38:12] <bgilbert_> it's a mess
[11:38:15] <robertmaxrees> you'd work with them to update your instance, not everybody's.
[11:40:44] <bgilbert_> i can't actually find what's specifically trapping focus
[11:40:59] <robertmaxrees> it's likely a blur handler.
[11:41:42] <bgilbert_> i can delete a focus handler in chrome event listeners, but the handler just points to a plugin repo js file
[11:42:09] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[11:52:15] <bgilbert_> idk why but removing "tabindex" on this random element not even related to mine fixed it
[11:52:17] <bgilbert_> ????
[11:53:38] <bgilbert_> i guess i'll take it
[11:58:51] <robertmaxrees> take what?
[11:59:38] <bgilbert_> "idk why but removing "tabindex" on this random element not even related to mine fixed it"
[12:00:08] <robertmaxrees> any js errors in the console?
[12:00:45] <bgilbert_> nah
[12:01:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd still be cautious of anything like that.
[12:01:50] <bgilbert_> how come? By unrelated i should say its the wrapper for the other modal that seems to be breaking things
[12:01:57] <bgilbert_> its the grayed out overlay thing
[12:02:23] <bgilbert_> i think the script is basically to see if they are clicking the gray area close the modal, which is what breaks my modal
[12:02:39] <bgilbert_> idk why its related to tabindex though, i mean besides element focusing
[12:03:19] <robertmaxrees> you probably broke something else.
[12:04:57] <bgilbert_> the other modal seems fine
[12:08:47] <z1haze> how does one send data with triggering an event?
[12:08:56] <z1haze> trying something like $(window).trigger('eventDate:change', $eventDate.val());
[12:11:32] <z1haze> actually i may have it -- i see more info at the bottom of the trigger page
[12:12:19] <z1haze> hmm, still no -- anyone?
[12:13:25] <z1haze> this does not work: https://bpaste.net/
[12:13:25] <z1haze> goodness .. https://bpaste.net/show/a7aa743ea663
[12:15:03] <z1haze> got it.
[16:39:28] <MACscr> ok, so i have drag and resize working, but want to add rotate to it. Figured a little ball at the top. This is what i have so far https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ. Any suggestions?
[17:14:09] <MACscr> darn, thought i found a plugin for rotating, but seems its not well supported and breaks after something is resized
[17:19:18] <MACscr> actually it does work. woo hoo
[17:19:38] <taplar> that's a twist
[18:08:01] <MACscr> hmm i somehow just screwed it all up though. really odd. seems my rotatable-handle is now relative to the body as far as position versus the .box its assigned too
[18:08:17] <MACscr> darnit
[18:08:26] <MACscr> lol, i keep screwing stuff up i guess
[18:09:35] <MACscr> so for some reason the handle when the page first loads is relative to the page, but as soon as i click on it, it goes back to being relative to the assigned div
[18:51:07] <z1haze> what is the jquery equivalent to .some() if there is one?
[18:52:16] <taplar> not sure that there is one.  a filter with a length check does effectively the same thing
[18:52:36] <z1haze> ha i was jsut going to ask if that was the best option
[18:52:43] <z1haze> good deal
[18:52:44] <z1haze> i guess..
[18:52:53] <taplar> what are you checking for?
[18:53:07] <MACscr> hmm, any ideas why my on.('click') isnt running when the element is actually being clicked, but does appear to run on page load? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ
[18:53:07] <z1haze> checking to see if a collection of fields have changed
[18:53:14] <taplar> depending upon that, you could potentially use is() or has()
[18:53:40] <z1haze> i need to iteration a collection and compare val() with a data value and return boolean
[18:53:44] <taplar> well, looks like has() is a form of a filter, so is()
[18:53:59] <z1haze> its not a form but
[18:54:05] <taplar> yeah, filter() probably the way to go
[18:54:41] <taplar> $('.pub_element').on('click', make_modifiable() );  take off the () MACscr
[18:54:56] <taplar> you are calling the method rather than giving the on the method as a callback
[18:55:26] <taplar> you only want to call the method in that way, if the result of the method is another method
[18:58:35] <MACscr> taplar thanks!
[18:58:46] <MACscr> sometimes i go back to php mindset
[18:58:52] <taplar> :)
[19:03:47] <z1haze> hey taplar, here's my function that im makign to check if the form has changed.. but calling this function passing in these same fields returns in a truthy response .. anything jumping out at you that is flawed? https://bpaste.net/show/2a9439953c34
[19:04:34] <z1haze> oops, forgot the call portion.. im just doing if (isFormChanged($('#shipping-address-fields :input'))) {
[19:04:59] <z1haze> my expectation is that when i change nothing it should return 0 which would be falsey
[19:05:51] <taplar> what kind of values are we talking about?
[19:06:06] <taplar> any numerics?
[19:06:10] <z1haze> string values
[19:06:21] <z1haze> uhhhh i think we're using all strings
[19:06:37] <z1haze> almost certain -- think that might throw it off?
[19:06:45] <taplar> try changing !== to !=
[19:07:04] <taplar> side effect of data() is that it will try to auto convert crap on you
[19:07:20] <taplar> so if a data field is "1" it will turn it into 1
[19:08:07] <z1haze> oh interesting, can i does it not to do that
[19:08:21] <z1haze> id rather do that instead of doing a less stricy check
[19:08:26] <taplar> i'm not sure there is a way to tell it not to do that
[19:08:28] <z1haze> anyhow ,testing now.
[19:08:45] <z1haze> i just logged out the values both times and they look identical in console so we'll see what the === makesd a diff
[19:09:24] <taplar> you could always swap to attr('data-initial-value') as a getter and setter to get around that
[19:09:41] <z1haze> still coming back truthy
[19:09:44] <z1haze> hmm
[19:10:13] <taplar> console.log the two things in the filter.
[19:10:16] <z1haze> let me see what the actual length of the filter is maybe that could help
[19:10:51] <z1haze> ok, yeah, its making all 12 elements as not matching
[19:11:17] <z1haze> i thought iwas being so smart too :D
[19:11:41] <z1haze> aha!
[19:11:47] <z1haze> undefined on the data value.. weird
[19:12:04] <z1haze> how in the hell is that
[19:12:51] <taplar> r you certain your first each at the top is running before that point?
[19:13:09] <z1haze> yeah, because the function only runs on submit
[19:13:18] <z1haze> and the first part runs on init of the page
[19:13:32] <taplar> stick a console log in it just to be sure, :)
[19:13:36] <z1haze> i even did a console log($(this).data('initialValue')) in there
[19:13:37] <z1haze> i did
[19:13:39] <taplar> k
[19:13:39] <z1haze> it logs all 12
[19:13:55] <z1haze> i just checked my query to make sure they are the same, and they are exactly the same
[19:14:51] <taplar> typo!
[19:15:03] <taplar> initalValue, missing an 'i' in there
[19:15:05] <z1haze> story of my life
[19:15:10] <z1haze> freakin a man
[19:15:22] <taplar> :)
[19:15:52] <z1haze> i hope im not alone there
[19:15:57] <taplar> nah
[19:16:59] <z1haze> well thank you again. its working just how i imagined it should
[19:17:12] <z1haze> do you think thats a good way to easily track changes though?
[19:17:24] <taplar> well, i was just thinking about that
[19:17:48] <taplar> it might be an interesting approach to consider adding an on('input', ...) to the inputs
[19:18:11] <z1haze> to do what?
[19:18:19] <taplar> do that conditional in it, if they are different, add a class to the input of 'changed' or something.  If they are the same, remove the class.
[19:18:28] <taplar> then your method you have is much smaller
[19:18:42] <taplar> you wouldn't really need that method then
[19:18:44] <z1haze> just moving the logic somewhere else though ha
[19:19:05] <taplar> sure, but rather than checking all the elements that may have changed, your input handler checks the ones that are changing
[19:19:11] <z1haze> well this is certainly better than the old way they had.. they were just manually going through every field and doing an == on it
[19:19:38] <z1haze> oh right, in my case i dont care about only the changed fields
[19:19:42] <z1haze> if that's what youre getting at
[19:19:45] <taplar> yeah
[19:19:52] <z1haze> if any of them are changed is all i care about
[19:20:11] <z1haze> eg, change the phone, gotta send the whole thing up to the server to verify
[19:20:55] <taplar> yeah, so if you did the input handler paired with the class, to know if any changed would be just $('#shipping-address-fields .changed').length
[19:21:44] <taplar> i'm fixing to run home though.  catch you later.  luck with all that
[19:27:50] <MACscr> hmm, any ideas why when i initially click on it and havent resized yet, that my middle resize boxes arent aligned properly? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ
[19:28:05] <MACscr> the handle that is
[20:33:32] <z1haze> can jquery do like a Promise.all with multiple $.get requests?
[20:36:24] <z1haze> or can you chain $.get calls?
[20:48:41] <z1haze> does jquery return normal promises with ajax calls in version 3.x?
[23:42:07] <MACscr|lappy> https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/WmKrrZ so any ideas why either my side resize squares are not center aligned until its resized or why the rotate dot isnt positioned relative to the box unless you click on it?
