[05:22:18] <santosh> Guys! How to write this in jQuery? If <figcaption> is empty, remove it's parent's parent.
[07:53:34] <quattro_> $form.find('button').prop("disabled", true).text('Loading...'); I have this inside a form submit event function, why doesnâ€™t this disable the submit button?
[08:03:11] <decx> should work
[09:04:24] <vavkamil> hello
[09:04:56] <vavkamil> I need some help with the website I am working on right now, is this a right channel?
[09:23:05] <vavkamil> ahh it's not with jquery, I have problem with html anchor tags :)
[10:43:12] <ExeciN> I'm trying to perform something in both pure JS and jQuery but my jQuery implementation doesn't work. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/aBrzxN?editors=1011#0 what am I doing wrong? The object returned by document.getElementById(id) and $("#"+id) seems to be different
[10:47:47] <decx> no files in x because $() wraps the node
[10:48:28] <decx> would be x.prop('files') or x.get(0).files
[13:34:40] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[13:34:45] <GeekMonkey> Is anyone here?
[13:35:18] <taplar> probably
[13:35:20] <GeekMonkey> I am looking for a jquery questionairre.... to direct the user to the final spot... kinda like a digital flow chart
[13:35:38] <GeekMonkey> through a series of yes/no questions
[13:35:47] <GeekMonkey> seen anything like that
[13:36:51] <taplar> you mean certain questions only show due to previous answers?
[13:38:13] <GeekMonkey> taplar yes
[13:38:38] <taplar> may have seen that before, but not necessarily as a jquery plugin
[13:39:38] <GeekMonkey> Do you like dogs or cats? .... Dogs..... what type of dog? (Boxer, Lhasa Apso, Lab etc) ... Boxer .....
[13:41:19] <taplar> it's kinda more business logic implementation though, not so much dom manipulation or enhancement.  so it's kinda out of the pervue of jquery
[13:43:37] <bjsnider> lhasa apso? hair and noise
[14:20:52] <GeekMonkey> bjsnider... ever heard of a lhasa apso?
[14:25:09] <bjsnider> maybe...no...yes
[14:32:19] <GeekMonkey> bjsnider have you seen something like that? basically a jquery flowchart?
[14:32:45] <bjsnider> i'm sure i have
[14:33:28] <GeekMonkey> but a questionairre so they do not see all the things at once
[14:34:24] <bjsnider> you could use a css class called "hide" with display:none, and then construct the whole page in html, using the class on just about everything, and use your juery to remove the class depending on each choice
[14:45:07] <GeekMonkey> I was thinking of that... or create different blocks of content that content the yes or no for each content
[15:18:18] <btracht> i am using $.validator.addMethod("unique" to check for duplicates in an html form
[15:18:40] <btracht> how do i get it to work with dynamically created input fields?
[15:20:06] <btracht> this is the full validating script http://pastebin.com/sYVTnKVk
[15:22:07] <btracht> also would like i to check dropdowns for duplciates. i dont believe that it does with script as is
[15:59:39] <madprops> is it possible to execute javascript with .attr('src', something) ?
[16:04:35] <GeekMonkey> madprops what are you trying to do
[16:04:45] <madprops> im trying people NOT to do something
[16:04:47] <madprops> inject js
[16:06:29] <GeekMonkey> if you well I could use $(yourelement).attr('src', 'http://google.com');
[16:07:03] <madprops> yeah but how about alert('sasd') somewhere in that
[16:07:06] <madprops> would it execute it?
[16:07:26] <madprops> like in the src field
[16:19:44] <GeekMonkey> if I clicked the element
[16:19:54] <GeekMonkey> I could put js instead of the url
[17:10:35] <checkit> Ello.. How do I access the context of $(this) from within a custom plugin? Ex: $("#elm").plugin(); $.fn.plugin = function () { $(this); };
[17:19:11] <checkit> Nevermind. Dumb question... Was out of context...
[17:33:00] <madprops> does .load(){} mean the image loaded succesfuly?
[17:33:30] <madprops> nevermind
[17:33:33] <madprops> i think load is something else
[18:20:45] <checkit> How can I pass data back from a custom plugin like: $("#el").plugin(function(callback) { ... });
[18:25:35] <shoky> checkit: pass from where to where?  either way, depends how the plugin is written
[18:27:06] <checkit> shoky: if I have a custom plugin $.fn.plugin = function () { ... }, I want to return data for continued processing on the selector $("#el").plugin(...); Does that make sense?
[18:28:10] <shoky> checkit: still not clear from where to where this data is sent/returned.. and when?  give a more complete example
[18:29:00] <shoky> plugin methods are just functions like any other
[19:35:40] <physikoi> Hello #jquery, I'm trying to make use of the History API and I'm on a snag. Basically, popstate is being triggered multiple times when i "go back" on the browser. What are some of the possible reasons why? Thanks
[20:40:37] <QualityAddict> Trying to figure out why my whole page is loading rather than just the <div>.
[20:40:49] <QualityAddict> I have jQuery library included in <head>; do I need to include an ajax library separately or does jQuery take care of that for me?
[20:54:44] <shoky> jquery has $.ajax built-in
[20:55:36] <QualityAddict> shoky: Okay, thanks.
[21:00:12] <QualityAddict> Got it working, though I can't tell you how or why, lol.
