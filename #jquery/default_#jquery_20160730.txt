[08:47:28] <Masber> Hi
[08:47:36] <Masber> I have an input type number
[08:48:05] <Masber> but when I call my .val() I get a String intead of the string
[08:48:09] <Masber> how's that?
[09:34:29] <Masber> I have an <input type='number' id='numberBox'> element but when I do $('#numberBox').val() I get a String instead of a number, is that the way it should be?
[09:49:22] <shoky> Masber: yes. input values are strings
[09:50:17] <Masber> shoky: ok so what is the recommended way to convert to number?
[09:50:42] <shoky> Masber: i use  Number(str)
[09:50:50] <Masber> ok
[09:50:53] <Masber> thanks!
[09:51:21] <shoky> sure
[10:32:30] <z1haze> do people still use requirejs ? sorry if thats a goofy question
[10:33:01] <z1haze> is it still popular i guess im asking, vs browserify and webpack etc
[11:45:37] <Mrprocom> how do I use $.getJSON to get the content of a .json file that contains HTML code instead of valid json code? I can't use $.get because I'm using the http://www.whateverorigin.org/ proxy to get the source code of a .json file and for some reason it errors when I use $.get instead of $.getJSON
[11:51:06] <Faizan> Is there a way I can add a class only to a button with a certain attribute)
[11:51:38] <shoky> Mrprocom: if you're using that service then as you can see in their example they're using JSONP and sending you an object with a .contents property that has the data. and in their example they're doing it on an HTML page like you want
[11:51:49] <Faizan> I have a container full of buttons, each with a unique data-foodtype attribute, and I want to add a class only to the one that's been clicked. I guess the only way to tell them apart is using the unique attribute but how would I go about doing this>?
[11:52:56] <shoky> Faizan: in the click event handler, `this` should be the clicked element (or the element you added the handler on). so you can do $(this).addClass(..)  for example
[11:53:24] <shoky> and generally if you need to select by attribute, there are attribute selectors
[11:53:29] <Faizan> the problem is that the click handler is for all buttons, not one click handler for each button
[11:53:38] <Faizan> so that didn't work, unless I did something stupid
[11:53:40] <shoky> right but a click event is only for one of them
[11:53:43] <shoky> not for all of them
[11:53:43] <Faizan> let me check again
[11:53:47] <shoky> only one is clicked
[11:53:51] <shoky> that will be `this`
[11:54:34] <Faizan> oh wow I don't know why it didn't work earlier but that did the trick shoky
[11:54:44] <Faizan> thanks!
[11:58:28] <Mrprocom> shoky: yes, but in the example, they were doing it on a .html file, not a .json file with html inside
[11:58:38] <Mrprocom> here is the website I want to get contents from http://www.whateverorigin.org/get?url=http%3A//powdertoy.co.uk/Download/Browse.json
[11:58:55] <Mrprocom> first line: {"contents":<h1>All Releases</h1>
[11:59:08] <shoky> Mrprocom: the extension of the file is meaningless
[11:59:45] <shoky> Mrprocom: ah
[12:00:39] <Mrprocom> if I use .getJSON on it, it will error saying "SyntaxError: Unexpected token <"
[12:01:08] <shoky> Mrprocom: then you can't do it with this service it seems
[12:01:22] <Mrprocom> oh :(
[12:01:32] <shoky> it's giving back invalid javascript
[12:01:44] <Mrprocom> thanks for helping me out anyway
[14:01:19] <sweatsuit> is there a way to call a function after all items in an .each() are completed?
[14:05:58] <arc_> yeah, put it on the next line outside of the each ;)
[14:07:48] <arc_> each is synchronous so you don't need a done callback or anything like that
[14:18:30] <sweatsuit> arc_: thx... i was overthinking it
[14:18:59] <arc_> ya, it happens
[14:20:46] <sweatsuit> more than i'd like :)
[15:09:45] <Jerrry> I have a question. If I have a layout that changes depending on the size of the images, but I want to do lazy loading, does my server have to keep and serve the dimensions of the image to avoid layout problems?
