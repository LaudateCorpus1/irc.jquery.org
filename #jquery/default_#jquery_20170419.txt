[00:12:03] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[00:12:38] <GeekMonkey> http://codepen.io/ntoye/pen/bZWavz I wonder if anyone can help me create the similar thing but use data attributes to set the values
[03:49:08] <IamTrying> Co-Browsing plugin exist? e.g: 1) boyfriend/girlfriend goes to iamCoBrowsing.com 2) boyfriend move cursor, girlfriend see cursor of boyfriend, girlfriend move cursor boyfriend see cursor of girlfriend
[03:55:47] <Cork> IamTrying: https://togetherjs.com/
[03:56:16] <Cork> i think mozilla has a project for it too, (used in etherpad) but i don't remember the name
[03:57:17] <FilipNortic> thought he ment as a jQuery-plugin and got confused
[03:57:44] <Cork> don't see why it would need to be integrated into jquery
[03:57:56] <Cork> it isn't even really related
[03:58:50] <FilipNortic> yeah, thus my confusion
[03:59:18] <IamTrying> Cork: i used TogetherJS but it does not work in iOS that is why searching fallback plan. if there is any with jQuery already.
[03:59:41] <Cork> uh, touch doesn't have cursors so...
[04:00:10] <Cork> or do you mean caret?
[04:01:03] <IamTrying> Cork: when you use iOS then the inputs of moving your finger does not show on other side.
[04:01:22] <IamTrying> Also portrait and landscape problems
[04:01:38] <Cork> IamTrying: ya, cause that is moving an element, not a cursor
[04:01:46] <Cork> touch doesn't have cursors
[04:03:14] <IamTrying> YES  - you are correct. its touch not cursors like desktop. but also the sender Google chrome is not properly shown in iOS
[04:03:29] <IamTrying> ignoring the iOS inputs but rendering on iOS fails.
[04:04:31] <IamTrying> suppose IE Edge sending inputs to iOS then the movement and clicks are completely invalid (tons of issues), therefore was looking alternative. Sadly there is none..
[04:12:26] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/cwuXir7.png - Guru Cork, the library is huge. There is a built in jQuery 1.8 inside the library. How do i remove the mic/chat button any idea?
[04:19:26] <Cork> ah togetherjs is the mozilla project
[04:19:37] <Cork> IamTrying: i've never used it so no i don't have any info for you
[04:24:43] <IamTrying> Cork: No problem, thanks. i have figured it out now. It looks like a mess to do all those, they used some inline html/css codes there i have to remove it.
[04:25:27] <IamTrying> And everywhere there name written, i have to replace them to "iamCrying"
[05:34:07] <IamTrying> Cork: YES it works on iOS too now. But where are some major changes needed to be fixed for iOS. Thanks for the advise. Now it works
[05:49:36] <sigdk> A button that shows/hides divs via `display: none/block`...  how can I trigger an action whenever a specific div is shown or hidden?   $("myDivSelector").on("show", ...  doesn't seem to work
[06:01:45] <AdamPDotty> There is always something getting it to show.
[06:14:58] <__hassoon__> 'morning
[06:15:22] <__hassoon__> guys anyone who tried the jquery Panzoom plugin by timmywil ?
[06:15:39] <__hassoon__> it's working fine in firefox, but in chrome, i can't Pan the image
[06:15:58] <__hassoon__> i mean grab it when it's zoomed to see other areas of the zoomed surface
[06:20:26] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, I can do something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/cj4sgwow/28/  When a link is clicked, trigger an action via an if-else, yet I'd rather register an event handler
[06:22:40] <__hassoon__> did even follow those instructions , but it's useless https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom/issues/320
[06:44:08] <sigdk> I'm working with eclipse, mostly because of the backend (java). Do you know whether there is a good jquery plugin for it?
[06:47:32] <itsgokul> why does select2 open upwards
[07:04:36] <cluelessperson> window.location.hash = '#!test';
[07:04:39] <cluelessperson> why doesn't that work?
[07:13:58] <__hassoon__> my whole website works on jquery 1.9.1, but I have a specific plugin called Panzoom that works best on jquery 3.1.0, is there some way to keep everything relying on jquery 1.9.1, but also keep the plugin working on jquery 3.1.0 ?
[07:27:12] <cluelessperson> __hassoon__: test 3.1 and see if its backwords compat?
[07:33:33] <__hassoon__> cluelessperson: yeah 3.1.0 seems to be fine, but i'm not the one who owns the website, imma see with our client
[07:33:40] <__hassoon__> customer
[07:33:42] <__hassoon__> whatever he is called
[08:11:06] <sigdk> cluelessperson, I'm new to webdev, what is the purpose of window.location.hash? Yesterday Robert helped me with this: https://jsfiddle.net/cj4sgwow/29/   Essentially I'm showing/hiding divs based on the link clicked. Could I somehow make use of window.location.hash?
[08:23:17] <rjCousineau> Hi. I'm using $.ajax abort(), and i chrome dev panel > network, i can see the XHR requests showing (canceled). but, the last request takes so long, as if the canceled xhr requests are still processing.
[08:23:55] <rjCousineau> Each xhr is 1sec to load.  If I run 9 xhr request and cancel them all within 50ms, the 10th request takes 10 seconds to complete
[08:30:03] <Cork> rjCousineau: sounds like you're losing one of the xhr objects then cause when all of them are canceled it shouldn't take any time at all
[08:30:57] <Cork> sigdk: location.hash is the part of the url after the # (including the #) in the current pages url
[08:37:06] <sigdk> Cork, if I understood correctly it's used to jump among divs on the same page, correct? Would it fit here: https://jsfiddle.net/cj4sgwow/29/  ?
[08:37:31] <Cork> no it is not, it is just a "data point"
[08:37:43] <Cork> it can also be used to target <a id="hash value">
[08:37:50] <Cork> but that's it
[08:38:19] <Cork> if you want to use it for anything, sure, it no problem
[08:42:19] <janemba> hi
[08:42:40] <janemba> is it ok for a DataTables question  ?
[08:56:28] <zampa> I'm using jquery /bootstrap tabs.. But when loading in content via ajax i very briefly see the content of all tabs before the tabs are up properly..
[08:57:10] <zampa> How can i avoid it displaying everything untill its all loaded in properly.
[08:58:15] <FilipNortic> hide them with css and remove in the end of the ready
[08:58:59] <zampa> dont think that works (or i just dont understand how to do it.. ) but looking at my code i realize whats causing the problem..  https://pastebin.com/fzgGj53n
[09:00:00] <zampa> its because i first set the output then add the tabs...
[09:01:50] <sigdk> zampa, can't you load only the content of the tab that is clicked?
[09:03:27] <zampa> I really have no idea how i would do that
[09:06:26] <Cork> zampa: that question is most likely better asked in ##bootstrap as it is more about bootstrap then jquery
[09:06:59] <Cork> you can get a generic how to make it not happen with jquery, but bootstrap might have a built in solution for it
[09:07:33] <zampa> The issue isn't tabs itself as its not the content of a specific tab its that i load in the entire page that holds the tabs via ajax/jquery.
[09:07:37] <zampa> But yeah ill try asking there.
[09:08:00] <Cork> zampa: if they can't help you make a jsfiddle showing the problem and we could help
[09:22:26] <tokam> why on document ready not all images have a height?
[09:22:31] <tokam> is there an other event?
[09:22:48] <tokam> *I did not come with document ready from jquery but with meteor template.rendered
[09:22:54] <Cork> on('load') is when resources are loaded
[09:23:01] <Cork> ready is when the dom is constructed
[09:25:28] <tokam> ok thanks
[10:25:32] <sigdk> https://learn.jquery.com/events/triggering-event-handlers/ At the end it says: "... it should not be used simply to call a function that was bound as a click handler... Then, you can call the function itself whenever you want, without the need for .trigger()."
[10:25:55] <sigdk> why not do this: function foo( event ) { ... }
[10:26:19] <sigdk> is it identical?  I can also call this whenever I want: foo();
[10:26:43] <taplar_> that's the point.  to be able to call foo(), not be forced to use trigger()
[10:30:10] <sigdk> taplar_, I didn't get it.  Why store it to a variable? Wouldn't this work: https://jsfiddle.net/4dp021j1/ ? Is it the same as in the documentation?
[10:30:57] <taplar_> they will end in the same result, but technically they are not the same
[10:31:32] <taplar_> named functions vs un-named functions behave slightly different in regards to when they are compiled and available
[10:35:24] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/4L5pk5xy/
[10:54:03] <Neo_122> hi guys !
[10:59:52] <hlve> Hi
[11:00:02] <Es0teric> ok so i am in a loop that has different object keys... how would i go about extracting the information in each object with their associated key?
[11:00:16] <hlve> i like your name, Es0teric
[11:00:22] <Es0teric> hlve thanks
[11:01:43] <taplar_> Es0teric: got a fiddle?
[11:01:56] <Es0teric> taplar_ uhhh no but i can make one shortly
[11:16:55] <Es0teric> does this look right if i wanted to add a class to a specific element? $('#buddypress .bp_reactions_reactions_list').find('[data-bp-activity-id="' + obj.oneh.id +'"]').find('a').find('[data-bp-reaction-id="oneh"]').addClass('reacted');
[11:19:12] <taplar_> looks syntactically correct
[11:21:35] <Es0teric> taplar_ right but its not adding the class
[11:21:37] <Es0teric> to the item
[11:22:01] <taplar_> so one or more of the selectors is inaccurate
[11:22:51] <Es0teric> taplar_ what do you mean?
[11:22:53] <Es0teric> they exist
[11:23:12] <taplar_> how have you verified that?
[11:23:23] <Es0teric> console.log()
[11:23:33] <taplar_> because if they existed, then your logic would work
[11:24:27] <Es0teric> taplar_
[11:24:28] <Es0teric> selector: "#buddypress .bp_reactions_reactions_list [data-bp-activity-id="1562314"] a [data-bp-reaction-id="oneh"]"
[11:25:36] <taplar_> console.log( $('#buddypress .bp_reactions_reactions_list').find('[data-bp-activity-id="' + obj.oneh.id +'"]').find('a').find('[data-bp-reaction-id="oneh"]').length ); immediately before you do that addClass call
[11:26:11] <Es0teric> taplar_ ah... 0
[11:26:13] <Es0teric> damn
[11:27:01] <Es0teric> so then how do i get it to find what i am looking for?
[11:27:20] <taplar_> fix your selectors
[11:27:25] <Es0teric> inside of .bp_reactions_reactions_list is <li><span><a>
[11:27:30] <Es0teric> i am trying to get the <a>
[11:27:51] <Es0teric> but i need the activity-id associated with .bp_reactions_reactions_list
[11:27:52] <taplar_> and verify that the elements exist at the time that runs, if they are being generated dynamically
[11:29:58] <Es0teric> taplar_ so i am doing this on the console and i got this error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-bp-activity-id="1562314"
[11:30:14] <Es0teric> taplar_ i ran this -> $('#buddypress .bp_reactions_reactions_list').find('[data-bp-activity-id="1562314"');
[11:33:13] <Es0teric> nvm
[11:37:28] <Es0teric> alright so i still dont understand where im going wrong
[11:42:14] * AdamPDotty counts brackets
[11:43:00] <AdamPDotty> They usually come in pairs, you know.
[11:44:21] <Es0teric> AdamPDotty yeah i know thats why i said nvm
[11:46:13] <AdamPDotty> plus you are doing the same thing twice in different ways on the same line which is at least confusing
[11:46:16] * AdamPDotty likes dat
[11:47:30] <AdamPDotty> Would be more obvious and more efficient ( I heard) to go $('#buddypress').find('.bp_reactions_reactions_list').find(..)
[11:52:32] <Es0teric> AdamPDotty yeah no
[11:52:44] <Es0teric> that doesnt provide me with what i am looking for either
[11:56:27] <AdamPDotty> seems the fiddle would help you most
[12:00:05] <Akuw> hi i am getting this error with venobox     http://pastebin.ca/3799173
[12:00:53] <taplar_> looks like you are not including the venobox plugin or you are including it before the jquery include
[12:08:42] <Akuw> taplar_: http://pastebin.ca/3799175
[12:09:21] <Akuw> jquery is included first
[12:09:33] <taplar_> check your network console and make sure it is finding all those files
[12:10:12] <Akuw> taplar_: yes, no issue with any path
[12:10:52] <taplar_> not sure then.  i'd have to see a fiddle with the issue in it
[12:15:13] <Es0teric> alright so this is what my markup looks like -> https://jsfiddle.net/kkm7b21v/
[12:18:26] <AdamPDotty> no data there
[12:23:57] <Akuw> getting error here   <!DOCTYPE html>
[13:08:40] <jtoy_> Hello I have a url to download something. I don't need a link on the DOM, though. How would i download a file via js?
[13:19:12] <hlve> ....download a file via js?
[13:19:34] <hlve> that sure would be exploitable, dontcha think?
[13:20:40] <hlve> or can you be more ... descriptive with what you're trying to accomplish?
[13:28:02] <sigdk> how can I decouple javascript from html here: https://jsfiddle.net/4dp021j1/2/   ?
[13:31:08] <taplar_> jtoy_: you should ask ##javascript.  There is a way to start a file download without a link with javascript, however it will still prompt the user if they want to perform the download in the first place
[13:32:36] <taplar_> sigdk: you could look into a templating library like handlebarjs or mustachejs for that, or roll your own basic one
[13:33:02] <taplar_> Es0teric: what about your markup?
[13:33:26] <Es0teric> taplar_ thats what i am trying to find.. the anchor
[13:33:44] <Es0teric> theres multiple .activity
[13:33:50] <taplar_> from what starting point?
[13:34:33] <sigdk> taplar_, templating libraries are used instead of me doing things like: <script id="myTemplate" type="text/template"> ... </script>   ?
[13:34:52] <taplar_> templating libraries use those
[13:35:06] <taplar_> *can
[13:36:24] <sigdk> taplar_, but this is what you mean with "roll your own basic one"  ? Use my own template, right?
[13:36:42] <taplar_> and the associated logic for putting the data into them
[13:37:11] <sigdk> taplar_, thank you
[14:01:17] <Dinnnn> Hi, I'm trying to use jquery-ui on flask, but whenever I check if it is loaded, or try to use it it doesn't work
[14:01:24] <Dinnnn> https://pastebin.com/raw/Lu1xAww1
[14:01:29] <Dinnnn> This is my code
[14:02:18] <Dinnnn> I've tried loading it at the end but still..
[14:06:35] <Lencl> what's the html output of the <script src?
[14:07:22] <Dinnnn> <script src="/static/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[14:07:30] <Dinnnn> It is a valid location
[14:09:50] <Lencl> so how then it isn't loaded?
[14:10:05] <Lencl> when you click on it, do you seee the jquery ui js?
[14:11:16] <Dinnnn> I test calling jQuery.ui
[14:11:21] <Dinnnn> it returns undefined
[14:11:40] <Dinnnn> and when trying to create a slider, i get an error, saying the function doesn't exist
[14:12:18] <Es0teric> wow this would be so much easier if it was on a click event
[14:12:34] <Es0teric> but recursively getting every div id and then adding something to the ul li a's is a pain in the ass
[14:16:34] <Lencl> go to http://yoururl.com/static/jquery-ui.js  does that exist?
[14:16:36] <Lencl> Dinnnn:
[14:16:55] <Dinnnn> Yes, It is a valid link
[14:17:06] <Dinnnn> Lencl:
[14:19:07] <Lencl> Dinnnn: and /static/jquery-3.2.0.js works as well?
[14:19:17] <Dinnnn> Yes
[14:19:19] <Dinnnn> jQuery loads
[14:19:21] <Dinnnn> and all other files
[14:19:36] <Dinnnn> and everything except for jquery-ui works
[14:19:53] <Lencl> might be conflicting with the other js files
[14:20:03] <Lencl> put it in the end
[14:20:10] <Lencl> then try that, Dinnnn
[14:20:27] <Dinnnn> I've tried that too
[14:20:44] <Dinnnn> Oh boy
[14:20:52] <Dinnnn> It seems to be a conflict with flask-bootstrap
[14:21:12] <Lencl> ah
[14:44:30] <a1dev> So i'm using jquery validate and i created a custom method and add it. the problem i am running into is that the method is running on all fields and not just the one i attached the rules to. Any ideas are welcome.
[15:08:13] <Juslintek> Hi, i've created this plugin https://paste.ofcode.org/TW3ZYMUgQzcm54G4g9rK9V, but it isn't locking itself to specific item, which is dynamically created and destroyed. For example if there are two instances of this plugin next to each other. Reordering doesn't work anymore. Any ideas how to fix it?
[15:09:19] <Juslintek> Basically problem is at line 156
[15:09:59] <Juslintek> If multiple instances of this plugin are made. The previous instance cannot find more then one children, even if they are created.
[15:12:42] <taplar_> i feel like your issue stems from your usage of 'this'
[15:13:11] <Juslintek> teplar, I somehow think that its from the usage of ES6 syntax
[15:13:37] <Juslintek> as this probably at that level becomes window instead of the object, functions are encapsulated in.
[15:13:49] <taplar_> regardless of the use of ES6, your initialize method is referencing 'this', but i'm not sure that they are unique per call
[15:13:55] <Juslintek> teplar_, but I'm not sure.
[15:14:15] <taplar_> add some console logs and debug whats going on, or do so with your browser debugger
[15:14:43] <Juslintek> taplar_, yes, because it is calling itself.
[15:14:54] <taplar_> did you verify that with console logs?
[15:15:07] <Juslintek> teplar_, yes.
[15:15:21] <Juslintek> taplar_, yes
[15:15:43] <Juslintek> Wait I'll create jsfiddle for you
[15:20:01] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/pp4f2mzc/1/
[15:20:59] <newb007> I'm trying to make a table header sticky without having to limit the size of the body.  I know uikit does it but I'm not sure how they do it with javascript.  Can anyone help me with this?
[15:36:00] <flavioamorim1> good afternoon, I'm doing a project using sortable and I need to block areas that are not red, these areas should not receive the sortable item
[15:36:04] <flavioamorim1> https://jsfiddle.net/flavioamorim/nutww9jy/4/
[15:36:36] <flavioamorim1> help me please
[15:58:51] <Juslintek> taplar_, here is an example: https://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/L4bbcja5/
[15:59:18] <taplar_> Juslintek: the fiddle i provided showed the 'this' is being shared for the calls
[15:59:20] <Juslintek> Add multiple child nodes without adding extra fields
[15:59:40] <Juslintek> taplar_, how to fix it?
[16:00:11] <taplar_> you'll have to figure out some way to contextualize the logic by whatever element it is operating upon
[16:00:53] <Juslintek> taplar_, what does contextualize mean?
[16:01:04] <taplar_> within a context
[16:01:17] <Juslintek> I know ajax has context
[16:01:29] <Juslintek> where you can pass this to callback function
[16:01:42] <taplar_> it's not unique to ajax.  context is simply the scope in which you are acting upon
[16:01:50] <Juslintek> Can you show me code example?
[16:02:20] <Juslintek> If you would look at my example, there is another library
[16:02:24] <taplar_> $('body').find('.test') <-- the context there for finding the test element is the body
[16:02:28] <Juslintek> for nodes nesting.
[16:03:02] <Juslintek> So basically what I do, I create this.items object to store each node.
[16:03:53] <Juslintek> so maybe if I could put it inside that node as property.
[16:04:01] <Juslintek> but still it makes no sence
[16:04:03] <Juslintek> gah
[16:04:18] <Juslintek> My head is broken. Know not how to fix this.
[16:04:38] <Juslintek> You are telling me, to put observer at the upper level.
[16:05:06] <Juslintek> to reinit events on rerendering.
[16:05:46] <taplar_> no
[16:05:50] <taplar_> i'm telling you to create context
[16:06:10] <Juslintek> this.container is context
[16:06:10] <taplar_> 'this' is the same for every time you do the initialization
[16:06:24] <taplar_> which causes the elements being set on it to be overridden for every time it is called
[16:06:41] <Juslintek> per each item initialization it takes different container.
[16:06:52] <taplar_> it sets a different container on the same 'this' element
[16:06:56] <Juslintek> well at least parent for each container is different.
[16:06:59] <taplar_> so the past set containers are lost
[16:07:54] <Juslintek> taplar_, how do I save past container?
[16:08:32] <taplar_> there are a few ways.  do some googling and see what you can find.
[16:08:57] <taplar_> otherwise someone else in the room would have to help.  i can't do much side stuff currently
[16:11:18] <Juslintek> taplar_, I get it now. basically, I need to change this container to $('body').find('.conversation'); and then I will not need to initialize this library per each item.
[16:12:44] <taplar_> if you don't want the user to tell you which element it needs to initialize, and you're not going to create those elements dynamically after the page loads, sure, that's an approach possibly
[16:15:50] <Juslintek> taplar_, okay then thats a bad approach, tried it, doesn't work as expected.
[16:16:15] <Juslintek> Are there any example which are doing what you are talking about?
[16:17:19] <taplar_> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/ might be a good place to start
[16:18:41] <Juslintek> taplar_, you are talking about this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5490448/how-do-i-pass-the-this-context-into-an-event-handler
[16:19:21] <taplar_> no, give that learn page a read.  there is a section on creating plugins
[16:22:39] <Juslintek> taplar_, okay so bascially, you telling me, to move all the methods out of single object and assign them to vars and thats it.
[16:24:40] <taplar_> the methods could potentially be assigned to one object, however the data that they use needs to be related to whatever element they are acting upon
[16:26:43] <Juslintek> But it is like, that, because item.find('.conversation').multiplyInputs(); on line 327 https://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/L4bbcja5/
[16:28:01] <Juslintek> the conversations div which belongs to element which has unique id is passed into return multiplyInputs.initialize($(this));
[16:30:39] <Juslintek> $(this) then becomes container.
[16:34:53] <Juslintek> taplar_, fixed, by very simple change :-D
[16:35:05] <taplar_> cool
[16:35:09] <Juslintek> moving initialize, to jQuery wrapper
[16:35:18] <Juslintek> and changing this there to multiplyInputs
[16:35:25] <Juslintek> and returning instead of this
[16:35:27] <Juslintek> the multiplyInputs
[16:36:40] <Juslintek> wow thats so simple, but I don't get what is happening in the background
[16:38:10] <Juslintek> taplar_, here is the changed version: https://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/L4bbcja5/16/
[16:39:04] <Juslintek> can you explain me what is happening in the background, why returning object name instead of this, which equals the same content make it work, how does this create context?
[16:40:47] <taplar_> multiplyInputs is scoped to that method, meaning a new one will be created each time the method executes
