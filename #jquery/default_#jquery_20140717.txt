[00:43:05] <petzup> hello i need little help http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/1/ when i check checkbox Ecwid module and when Select dropdown is shown if i select like Venture i want to count it to total price Web Site Design total  how would i do it?
[00:48:31] <Cork> petzup: your html is invalid
[00:48:40] <Cork> you have multiple elements with the same id
[00:49:37] <petzup> hm
[00:49:43] <petzup> should i use class then?
[00:50:01] <Cork> if you want multiple elements with the same reference; yes
[00:50:08] <petzup> okey
[00:50:11] <Cork> that is exactly what class is for
[00:50:15] <petzup> what about sum from select
[00:50:35] <Cork> secondly never do parseInt(value)
[00:50:43] <Cork> you should always have the base as second argument
[00:50:50] <Cork> parseInt(val, 10)
[00:51:37] <petzup> i put now to class, but doesnt work anymore http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/2/
[00:52:11] <Cork> petzup: input[id="options"] => input.options
[00:52:12] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/3/ works ok..
[00:52:39] <Cork> don't use [class]...
[00:52:59] <z3l> Hello. I have a parent element A and A contains an ul list, each li contains <a></a> inside.
[00:53:14] <petzup> okey change it to input.options http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/4/
[00:53:47] <z3l> If I want to set an event on each of these <a> Im doing it with $A.find('li a').click();
[00:54:26] <z3l> when im in callback function inside click(); Im doing console.log(this);
[00:54:46] <z3l> But I get a string, how can I get the object, so later on I can retrieve what's between <a></a> tag.
[00:54:53] <z3l> ? Thank you.
[00:54:58] <Cork> petzup: simplest is prob something like $(this).closest('.list-group').find('input').val()
[00:55:10] <Cork> petzup: depending on if that is good enough for you though
[00:55:49] <Cork> z3l: make a jsfiddle
[00:55:52] <petzup> yes i want to get select value to be counted also to sum of all selected thinks
[00:57:06] <Cork> petzup: i would prob do something like var total; $.each($(form_name).serializeArray(), function() { total += parseInt(this.value 10); });
[00:57:23] <Cork> that should handle all the fields in the form
[00:57:25] <petzup> Cork could you put it to jsfiddle
[00:58:39] <Cork> petzup: do you have a form around this in the real page?
[00:58:52] <petzup> no just this what is on jsfiddle
[00:58:55] <petzup> no form yet
[00:58:59] <Cork> then you should add one
[01:01:08] <Cork> hmm
[01:01:19] <Cork> i think i might have misunderstood what you meant
[01:01:39] <z3l> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/LCaMv/
[01:01:46] <Cork> or maybe not
[01:01:51] <donni> how to make browser width as a trigger to an event?
[01:01:53] <z3l> I would like to retrieve the object instead of string
[01:02:28] <The_Ball> djQuery, thanks for showing me my new favourite tool; jsbin.com
[01:02:49] <z3l> w8, let me make another jsfiddle
[01:02:51] <djQuery> The_Ball, np
[01:03:56] <djQuery> donni, onresize
[01:03:58] <djQuery> ?
[01:04:23] <z3l> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/LCaMv/1/
[01:05:04] <donni> thank you dj
[01:05:40] <Cork> ah...
[01:05:53] <Cork> petzup: your fields doesn't have name attributes...
[01:06:53] <Cork> petzup: http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/6/
[01:06:58] <Cork> something like that
[01:07:16] <Cork> z3l: firstly please don't use broken links
[01:07:23] <Cork> either provide an url for the a tags
[01:07:28] <Cork> or use <button> instead
[01:07:38] <Cork> (you can style them to look like links if you like)
[01:07:54] <z3l> ok
[01:10:39] <Cork> z3l: http://jsfiddle.net/LCaMv/2/
[01:11:17] <z3l> Cork: Thank you.
[01:11:20] <Cork> np
[01:14:26] <Cork> petzup: might this be what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/8/
[01:14:36] <Cork> opps missed one
[01:15:34] <petzup> Cork, tnx it works, only problem is i already have form with id="form"
[01:16:02] <petzup> and also other elements like text, radio... so i think there will be problem with serialize?
[01:16:21] <Cork> petzup: http://jsfiddle.net/66hw2/9/
[01:17:09] <Cork> petzup: well what exist there seams to work now
[01:17:21] <Cork> if you have something else that breaks, you would have to add it :)
[01:24:20] <petzup> ok now i get it to works
[01:24:40] <petzup> one question more, how would i add class to span where checkbox is selected?
[01:25:03] <petzup> something like $('span.badge').addClass('alert-success');
[01:25:27] <Cork> $(this).filter(':checkbox').closest('span').addClass('alert-success')
[01:25:41] <Cork> $(this).filter(':checkbox').closest('span.badge').addClass('alert-success')
[01:25:49] <Cork> if the bade is a parent that is
[01:26:08] <Cork> ah, it isn't
[01:26:36] <Cork> $(this).filter(':checkbox').siblings('span.badge').addClass('alert-success')
[01:26:38] <Cork> should work
[01:27:14] <Cork> damn... no
[01:27:22] <Cork> the input is inside the label
[01:27:32] <Cork> $(this).filter(':checkbox').closest('li').find('span.badge').addClass('alert-success')
[01:28:13] <Cork> actaully i suspect you want it for all elements
[01:28:18] <Cork> so the filter can be removed
[01:29:08] <petzup> nice
[01:29:12] <petzup> works charm!
[01:29:13] <petzup> :)
[01:29:15] <petzup> tq
[02:13:57] <sharpy35> hey guys
[02:16:29] <sharpy35> i am working with the jquery cycle plugin version 1 and i have a quersion. lets say i have one page with 5 different sliders. each slider has like 3-4 slides which should be changed. we have an right and left arrow to move the slides from the sliders. now i have initiliased 5 cycles (one for each sliders) with different ids for right and left arrow key. when i switch the slider i change the id of the right and left arrow key. But i c
[02:16:37] <sharpy35> d slider, do you know why?
[02:46:04] <donni> how does the responsive page works?
[02:49:35] <Jimmy_Rustles> I'm wanting to serialize content from a div for posting, but serialize() and serializeArray() only work on "successful controls". Should I wrap the content I want to serialize in a form and turn everything into input fields? Or is there a better way to do that?
[02:50:14] <Whirl3d> sharpy35, don' change id's.
[02:50:21] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: serialize is for input fields
[02:50:36] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: depending on the structure you can do it with other functions though
[02:50:43] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: so make a fiddle to show the markup
[02:58:09] <donni> if i use .attr() it will replace the existing property or it will adding new property, in this case i want to change the value of an id
[03:00:57] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5pn8C/
[03:01:29] <Jimmy_Rustles> the div contents (title/subtitle/etc) are populated from elsewhere
[03:01:32] <Cork> donni: attr will change the existing ATTRIBUTE if it exist
[03:01:38] <Cork> donni: or create it
[03:01:43] <Cork> attr != property though
[03:02:08] <Jimmy_Rustles> so i don't technically want to turn them into input fields
[03:02:43] <donni> thanks Cork, so its better to use .attr() instead of .toggleClass(), right?
[03:02:53] <Cork> donni: no
[03:02:54] <Jimmy_Rustles> (once you click on a particular container, a modal pops up, which is responsible for the editing, and once you click 'save' in the modal, the container updates)
[03:03:03] <donni> why?
[03:03:09] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: attr is meant to be used for changing attributes
[03:03:17] <Cork> and 99% of the time that isn't what you want
[03:03:26] <Cork> attr('class') should NEVER be used
[03:03:43] <bongjovi> If I have a form with multiple inputs with names like "items[1000]", "items[1001]" and corresponding integer values, say "1" and "2", how would I serialize the form to give me a single array items = 1000 => 1, 1001 => 2?
[03:03:46] <Cork> in most cases you should use prop for none class or style attributes
[03:04:00] <Cork> as that uses the property of the dom element
[03:04:19] <Cork> and not the attribute (and the property is what the spec says the browser should monitor)
[03:04:36] <Jimmy_Rustles> do I want to change attributes?
[03:04:54] <Cork> bongjovi: you can't get an array, you could get an object though
[03:05:06] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: ugg sorry wrong nick
[03:05:10] <Jimmy_Rustles> in the non-fiddle example, i have an arbitrary number (let's say 100) of div containers, each with that identical title/subtitle/description format
[03:05:12] <Cork> donni: that was for you
[03:05:23] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: np, i was confused for a sec
[03:05:49] <bongjovi> Cork, so I could use serializeArray to serialize the form, then iterate through the array to build my object?
[03:05:59] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: you could loop the elements and do something like data[this.className] = $(this).text();
[03:06:09] <Cork> bongjovi: sure
[03:06:14] <bongjovi> cool, I'll try that, thanks
[03:06:56] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: what makes things a bit complicated is if you want to separate ex. subtitle and date
[03:07:26] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: if you can change the markup you could make this quite a bit simpler
[03:07:58] <Jimmy_Rustles> there's a lot of containers (i didn't design it), but i can change it
[03:08:12] <mbuf> when sending an AJAX request from a view, is it possible to identify the URL from where the request is being sent from?
[03:08:42] <mbuf> as in the controller/action URL
[03:09:31] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: http://jsfiddle.net/5pn8C/1/
[03:09:45] <bongjovi> Hmm, the PHP function that is using the data I'm $.POST ing requires an array? "array $products Simple array that has product_id:s as keys and qty as value array(123 => 4, 124 => 2)"
[03:09:55] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: just an example, you could choose a different structure if you like
[03:10:07] <bongjovi> Will an object still work in this case?
[03:10:31] <Cork> mbuf: most likely not, as js doesn't have views
[03:10:50] <Cork> mbuf: if the backend stores this data in a variable somewhere you could use that
[03:10:54] <mbuf> Cork, ohh!
[03:10:59] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: neat. Which docs should I read to understand what I'm looking at?
[03:11:08] <Jimmy_Rustles> (the [data-name] part)
[03:11:16] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: that is just a simple css selector
[03:11:32] <Cork> select all elements with an attribute data-name inside #cont1
[03:12:11] <Jimmy_Rustles> ah cool. I haven't done much web dev (and have been using jquery for about a week). Thanks
[03:12:12] <Cork> bongjovi: php is a bit messed up about arrays
[03:12:24] <Cork> bongjovi: what you see there is what other languages call an object or a hash
[03:12:38] <Cork> bongjovi: in most languages arrays doesn't have a key
[03:12:41] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: I appreciate your help. thanks!
[03:12:46] <Cork> it is a zero based list of values
[03:13:22] <Cork> bongjovi: so the key => value "array" in php mapps 1:1 to objects in javascript
[03:13:40] <Cork> or hash is c/c++/java/ruby/perl....
[03:13:52] <Cork> s/perl/python/
[03:14:50] <bongjovi> I essentially need to pass an object with a key
[03:14:54] <bongjovi> I guess
[03:15:05] <bongjovi> so items=object
[03:18:12] <Whirl3d> I am working on an alignment library whereby elements can have an "alignmentPoint" defined and any subsequent .alignTo actions will align to that point instead of top left.
[03:18:44] <Whirl3d> I want a library of common alignment point definitions, but how do I do that and keep scope?
[03:19:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/vAjzR/8/
[03:19:41] <svetlana> $('li').each() is ok, but what if i'd like to loop through elements of a js element (like "{'foo': 'bar', 'baz': '...'}")?
[03:19:59] <Whirl3d> $.each()
[03:20:15] <svetlana> OK.
[03:23:30] <Whirl3d> Can you define a function wherein you use "this.action" because you know that you will be applying an object with .action methods in the future? I think it just throws an error right away.
[03:47:52] <jsdev_> hi guys , im using "overlay().load()" , i have jquery ui 1.8 and jquery core 1.8 , but im gettign the following error " a.mask.load is not a function" , do u have any idea please ?
[04:04:48] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: I wasn't able to get that fiddle working (it just shows value: ""). Any ideas?
[04:08:56] <jsdev_> guys , any help ?
[04:21:27] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: link?
[04:29:13] <Whirl3d> jsdev_ I usually get that error when I have incorrectly written my jquery selector
[04:30:07] <Whirl3d> jsdev_, post your code to jsfiddle if you want help.
[04:32:50] <Ragnaroek> does .html(content) eval <script> Tags?
[04:32:59] <Cork> Ragnaroek: yes
[04:33:42] <Jimmy_Rustles> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5pn8C/1/
[04:33:59] <Cork> gah...
[04:34:04] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: ya, my error
[04:34:26] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: http://jsfiddle.net/5pn8C/2/
[04:34:35] <Cork> quite a simple mistake but... GAH >_<
[04:35:30] <Jimmy_Rustles> dang, I should've noticed that too
[04:35:34] <Jimmy_Rustles> thanks
[04:40:00] <Whirl3d> var items=$(".item"); items=items.eq(0);   <--is that an okay way to ensure that you only get one element in a query?
[04:40:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: sure
[04:41:03] <Whirl3d> thx
[04:41:14] <Cork> Whirl3d: Whirl3d or var items = $(".item").first();
[04:41:56] <Whirl3d> right on. I'll use that
[04:45:32] <Ragnaroek> @Cork: is this document somewhere. The documentation says nothing about it and in the code its not obvious that it is happening
[04:45:32] <b-ot> Ragnaroek: memorised “Cork:”.
[04:46:01] <Cork> Ragnaroek: don't use @
[04:46:06] <Cork> b-ot depends on it >_<
[04:46:27] <Cork> Ragnaroek: .html does the same thing as innerHTML
[04:59:42] <Hausas> Is there a way to expand an <input type='text'> thing to a width that's relative to text inside that input?
[04:59:53] <Hausas> There should be a way. It's jQuery!
[05:04:56] <Hausas> $(input).on('focus', function() { this.width(SOMETHING_HERE); }); ?
[05:10:00] <JustMozzy> anyone here has experienc with google maps?
[05:10:12] <JustMozzy> am trying to change some options on runtime, but it doesn't seem to be working
[05:12:06] <JustMozzy> oh nevermind, I changed the options on the wrong object lol
[05:13:05] <karamazov> Any ideas why the data attr wouldn't be assigned to this instance? http://jsfiddle.net/DsKn8/
[05:14:22] <killerswan> Is there a more elegant way to read QUnit results besides walking the DOM?
[05:15:50] <Whirl3d> karamazov, I think you have to append it to the dom, don't you?
[05:16:11] <karamazov> Whirl3d: Before assigning data?
[05:16:19] <Cork> Hausas: you would have to copy the text to a different element (a span)
[05:16:27] <Cork> Hausas: else you can't get the width of the text
[05:16:30] <svetlana> how do I set an input of type radio's label using jquery? .label('label here') is not a function, do i use .setAttr('label','label here')?
[05:16:37] <Cork> sadly js doesn't have an efficient way to do that calculation
[05:17:02] <karamazov> If i replace data : {} with attr : { "data-info": "test"} it works correctly but I didn't think that was the correct way
[05:18:49] <Whirl3d> karamazov, I have honestly never seen that notation before
[05:19:10] <Cork> Hausas: if you just want to expand the field, you could do http://jsfiddle.net/4ekVt/
[05:19:20] <Cork> but there is noway (at least not that i know) to go the other way
[05:19:39] <karamazov> Whirl3d: It was recommended by someone on here yesterday...I was told it's quite fast due to the way it creates it. Made sense at the time
[05:19:48] <Cork> oh, lol
[05:19:56] <Cork> yes there is, was easier then i though >_<
[05:20:03] <Cork> Hausas: http://jsfiddle.net/4ekVt/1/
[05:21:51] <Whirl3d> I think you have to use the data-lbl property in that instance. In other words data-info:"nothing"
[05:23:05] <Whirl3d> data, by itself is not a property of an element like src is. When it's a property, it's hyphenated like data-info="something"   jquery uses .data to set these attributes
[05:23:09] <Whirl3d> i think
[05:23:29] <Cork> it is
[05:23:43] <Cork> .data actually predates the existance of data-
[05:23:44] <karamazov> Gotcha - let me give that a go
[05:24:53] <DeliriumTremens> I'm having a heck of a time getting jquery ui to work to add a button with an icon
[05:24:56] <DeliriumTremens> http://hastebin.com/namezilona.xml
[05:29:11] <Hausas> Thanks. lemme check them links
[05:30:53] <karamazov> This is vague - but I'm not sure how to debug an animation issue? I'm using jQueryRotate.js to rotate on mouseover and if I move my mouse around a lot everything locks up. I'm assuming it's a memory leak?
[05:31:37] <Whirl3d> paste your code to jsfiddle
[05:31:45] <karamazov> Ha I'm so ashamed of it.
[05:31:53] <karamazov> one moment
[05:32:24] <Hausas> Yeah, one thing to consider. inputs are readonly. :D
[05:33:10] <karamazov> Whirl3d: This is my first plugin I've written, wasn't sure how to organize all the functions. Forgive me :) http://jsfiddle.net/3eAYr/
[05:36:26] <Cork> karamazov: please don't append links from inside the plugin
[05:36:36] <Cork> karamazov: add them as dependencies to the plugin instead
[05:36:49] <karamazov> Cork: Thanks - had trouble finding out how to best do that
[05:36:53] <Cork> (meaning let the site owner add them in the way that it works for them)
[05:37:28] <karamazov> Cork: Gotcha - I'll fix that, thanks!
[05:37:56] <Cork> karamazov: also $(function(){ isn't magical
[05:38:15] <Whirl3d> bite your tongue...
[05:38:17] <Cork> at the place you have it it will run EVERY TIME famousPeople is called
[05:39:03] <Hausas> Cork: your example works great. But I want to revert it back to 110px width when it loses focus
[05:39:04] <karamazov> Nah - I appreciate it, I don't want to continue bad practice.
[05:39:17] <Cork> Hausas: then bind a blur handler
[05:39:35] <karamazov> Cork: Can you give me an line?
[05:39:46] <Hausas> blur or focusOut ?
[05:40:05] <Cork> Hausas: basically same thing
[05:40:11] <Cork> jquery abstracts the differences
[05:40:21] <Cork> karamazov: the wrapper around where you add the link tag
[05:40:28] <Cork> karamazov: and the magical part isn't critic
[05:40:59] <Cork> it is quite common that ppl think that $(function() {}) is some form of not functional code
[05:41:08] <Cork> like a declaration syntax or something
[05:41:24] <Cork> karamazov: it wasn't critic of using it like that, many do this mistake
[05:41:42] <karamazov> Cork: I was having trouble understanding how to use it.
[05:41:50] <Cork> $(function() {}) (and the long hand $(document).ready())
[05:41:59] <Cork> builds around the DOMContentLoaded event
[05:42:06] <Cork> that event fire ONCE when the page loads
[05:42:16] <Cork> if that event has fired, jquery stores this
[05:42:24] <Cork> and the function you pass will execute directly
[05:42:36] <Cork> so in your case you could remove $(function() {})
[05:42:41] <Cork> and the code would work exactly the same
[05:42:59] <karamazov> Cork: You're referring to the return this.each section?
[05:43:01] <Cork> if you had moved it to line 2
[05:43:04] <Cork> it would have worked
[05:43:08] <Cork> karamazov: line 5
[05:43:51] <Cork> karamazov: and for the next set of common misconceptions :)
[05:44:03] <Hausas> Thanks a lot Cork. You are a star
[05:44:03] <Cork> in plugins this is jquery
[05:44:08] <karamazov> Cork: Oh. I removed that :) Keep them coming!
[05:44:10] <Cork> not a dom element like in normal events
[05:44:28] <Cork> so $(this).on (line 93) isn't needed
[05:44:31] <Cork> just do this.on
[05:44:47] <Cork> it will add the event listener to each element used for the function
[05:45:28] <karamazov> alright that makes sense
[05:46:07] <Cork> those are the only real coding errors i see
[05:46:15] <Cork> so for a first try, quite good job
[05:46:48] <karamazov> Thanks, yesterday was my first time writing jquery
[05:47:29] <Cork> karamazov: for the hanging problem
[05:47:39] <Cork> add some logging from the callback function
[05:47:47] <Cork> so you don't end up in an infinite loop there
[05:47:52] <Cork> that might be what happens
[05:48:23] <karamazov> Yeah - I think that a sporadic mouse movement can confuse it
[05:49:10] <Cork> karamazov: kinda hard to say
[05:49:18] <Ragnaroek> Cork: the standard specifies that they are not executed: http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080610/dom.html#innerhtml0
[05:49:19] <Cork> a working demo would make it a little easier
[05:49:27] <Cork> but it would still be quite tricky
[05:49:48] <karamazov> I'll add some logging - thanks for the input
[05:50:26] <Whirl3d> do you .stop your animations after each state change?
[05:50:38] <Cork> Ragnaroek: that should be when you modify the html
[05:50:56] <Cork> though... you make me uncertain now...
[05:51:43] <karamazov> Whirl3d: rotation and rotationBack increment a counter and once it equals 5 it calls the rotation home where it stops (as in has no callback). Maybe I should explicitly end it?
[05:53:00] <Whirl3d> so you just want an element to rotate on mouseover, count to 5 then rotate back? Not rotate back on mouse out
[05:53:46] <Cork> karamazov: hats of, i haven't used inline scripts for ages and has mixed that up
[05:54:06] <karamazov> The goal is to have the mouseover trigger the event which has it rotate right and left twice then return home.
[05:54:07] <Cork> karamazov: jquery has special code to evaluate scripts added with .html though
[05:54:15] <Cork> opps wrong nick again
[05:54:18] <Cork> Ragnaroek: ^
[05:55:34] <Whirl3d> karamazov, have you considered css3 animations? might work better with less code...
[05:56:11] <karamazov> Whirl3d: The plugin actually uses css3 animations to do it and jquery for older browsers. I had to support IE8
[06:10:53] <workerbeetwo> Hi. what may cause an ajax GET request not to be redirected while the same as url in the browser works perfectly?
[06:17:36] <Cork> workerbeetwo: cause it isn't a redirect?
[06:17:48] <Cork> workerbeetwo: ex. it uses <meta>
[06:17:50] <Cork> or js
[06:24:14] <karamazov> Cork: Should I feel bad that I got paid to code that jquery?
[06:24:25] <Cork> karamazov: lol no
[06:24:28] <Cork> not at all
[06:24:29] <workerbeetwo> Cork: apache redirects such calls from a browser, but when called from within javascript/jquery  then it seems to ignore apache.
[06:24:46] <karamazov> Cork: Whew....good. I've got some learning todo but it achieves the goal :)
[06:24:59] <Cork> workerbeetwo: check what headers you get back in the ajax call
[06:25:14] <Cork> workerbeetwo: remember that redirects isn't exposed to js
[06:25:21] <karamazov> Console.log on the animations revealed the issue as well, thanks for that.
[06:25:22] <Cork> (from ajax i mean)
[06:25:42] <Cork> karamazov: the more reason you shouldn't feel bad
[06:25:50] <Cork> you found your own problem and fixed it!
[06:26:18] <karamazov> It was a fun problem! Dealing with sprites instead of individual images
[06:26:23] <BillCris_> This hosting stuff isn't as complicated as I was making it out to be.
[06:26:28] <BillCris_> in my head
[06:26:51] <Cork> BillCris_: "hosting stuff"?
[06:27:33] <BillCris_> Cork: Like just understanding how all this shit works, DNS and crap. I've always had a server guy and I decided to learn this side of things a bit.
[06:27:51] <Cork> BillCris_: ah
[06:28:02] <Cork> the hardest part is normally to stay ontop of security problems
[06:28:31] <BillCris_> Yeah, not looking forward to that haha.
[06:28:34] <Cork> applying security updates and mitigating found security holes in the language/framework
[06:28:51] <BillCris_> I got multiple domains working with nginx which was interesting to me.
[06:29:06] <Cork> nginx is nice
[06:29:30] <BillCris_> It does seem awesome. Not sure I've ever worked on anything besides Apache.
[06:29:47] <BillCris_> Actually.. I did try lighttpd I think?
[06:29:53] <BillCris_> Not sure what the hell I did that for though.
[06:29:57] <Cork> ouch that is not a fav of mine
[06:30:17] <BillCris_> Cork: Yeah that was years ago.
[06:31:39] <Cork> BillCris_: writing the entire stack in go is surprisingly fun too
[06:31:57] <Cork> it has built in libs for creating a web server
[06:32:04] <Cork> so it is just a few lines of code )
[06:32:07] <Cork> *:)
[06:32:44] <BillCris_> I hear a lot of good things about Go.
[06:33:25] <BillCris_> Are there any Go CMS out there or would you even use it for that?
[06:33:28] <Cork> some makes it out to be a magic bullet though
[06:33:31] <Cork> something it isn't
[06:33:31] <jeffreylevesque> simple question.  Whats the difference between prefixing variables with $, and not - $var = 'something', var = 'another'
[06:33:40] <Cork> BillCris_: no, not really
[06:33:45] <BillCris_> jeffreylevesque: Preference.
[06:33:57] <BillCris_> Some people use it as a convention to know it's a jQuery object.
[06:34:06] <jeffreylevesque> can you still use jquery operations on variables declared withouth $
[06:34:08] <Cork> BillCris_: the closest you would go is html templates
[06:34:16] <Cork> and go would add the data to them
[06:34:27] <BillCris_> jeffreylevesque: I do like var $body = $('body'); but if I needed to save a number I'd just use var foo = 5;
[06:34:41] <BillCris_> Cork: Ah, nice. I'd need to read up.
[06:34:54] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: there is absolutely no difference between var $som = $() and var som = $()
[06:35:00] <BillCris_> jeffreylevesque: Yeah, you can do var body = $('body'); then body.addClass('jQuery-weeeee');
[06:35:20] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: the former is just a practice some like to use for "jquery data variables"
[06:35:21] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[06:35:42] <BillCris_> I am one of those. Plenty disagree!
[06:36:10] <BillCris_> It's like PHP invading the front-end.
[06:36:13] <Cork> i prefer to have descriptive variable names instead
[06:36:31] <Cork> if it is a jquery object or not shouldn't matter
[06:38:06] <BillCriswell> Cork: If you come across a variable named body would you just trace it back to see what kind of variable it is?
[06:38:23] <Cork> BillCriswell: i wouldn't have a variable named "body"
[06:38:48] <BillCriswell> Cork: How about.... jobPostingContainer ?
[06:39:15] <Cork> BillCriswell: that would always be a jquery object in my code
[06:39:36] <Cork> cause it indicates a container, == a dom element == always jquery object
[06:42:17] <BillCriswell> Seems like a reasonable approach.
[06:44:12] <Fohlen> hey guys, could someone be so nice and overlook what's wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/m9guW9pR
[06:44:16] <Fohlen> getting sloopy now :(
[06:47:34] <decx> cant ++ there
[06:47:47] <Cork> Fohlen: is #mehr_events inside .content ?
[06:47:53] <Fohlen> yep
[06:47:55] <Cork> decx: you don't like that hu?
[06:48:00] <Cork> Fohlen: then that is your problem
[06:48:07] <Fohlen> okay, I see :D
[06:48:15] <decx> well it doesnt work does it
[06:48:19] <Cork> the event handler will be lost when you replace the elements
[06:48:23] <Cork> it does
[06:48:28] <decx> no?
[06:48:37] <Cork> js> var a = 0; a++; print(a)
[06:48:43] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[06:48:47] <Cork> works fine
[06:48:50] <Cork> ah!
[06:48:56] <decx> js> var a; a++; print(a)
[06:49:01] <b-ot> decx: NaN
[06:49:01] <Cork> but var mehr_klicks; is a problem
[06:49:12] <Cork> Fohlen: var mehr_klicks; => var mehr_klicks 0 0;
[06:49:14] <Cork> opps
[06:49:17] <Cork> Fohlen: var mehr_klicks; => var mehr_klicks = 0;
[06:49:21] <decx> < smug face
[06:49:36] <Cork> decx: you pointed at the wrong place though :)
[06:50:06] <Fohlen> thanks for the help guys, so my only workaround is moving it out of content? Or can I use the .click function rather? :)
[06:50:25] <asbasc> I've got a question about the jquery datepicker!  How can I change the behaviour so that the calendar always pops up beneath the box? currently, if the window height is too low, the calendar is positioned at the top of the site
[06:50:47] <Cork> Fohlen: use delegated event listener
[06:51:03] <Cork> Fohlen: $(document).on('keyup', '#mehr_events', function() {})
[06:51:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: mehr_klicks sounds hilarious to me.
[06:51:22] <Cork> true :)
[06:51:26] <Fohlen> :D
[06:51:49] <BillCriswell> There's also .on('input') instead of keyup... that event is awesome.
[06:51:50] <Cork> though not sure if you know what it means
[06:51:57] <Cork> true again
[06:52:06] <Cork> though i'm not sure what he wants
[06:52:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'm just reading it as "More Clicks" but said by a weird creepy person.
[06:52:13] <Cork> so i didn't suggest it
[06:52:21] <Cork> lol
[06:53:14] <Cork> BillCriswell: mehr is german for more
[06:53:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: so if you mean all germans are creeps...
[06:53:39] <Cork> ;P
[06:54:10] <decx> well it doesnt work so more like mär klicks ... booom german puns
[06:55:42] <Cork> my language is based on german, so that is why it feels weird seeing short words
[06:55:48] <Cork> cause they mapp to swedish :)
[06:55:54] <Cork> mehr == mer
[06:56:21] <BillCriswell> I like "Meow".
[06:59:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/M9y7a/8/   soo close
[07:00:19] <decx> the hell is that supposed to do`
[07:00:57] <Whirl3d> allows you to align by a specific point....so align top center of one element with the bottom center of another..
[07:01:27] <decx> seems overly verbose
[07:01:34] <Whirl3d> totally
[07:01:53] <Whirl3d> It's my first working model. Lots of bugs, lots of opportunities to clean up.
[07:03:05] <ericx2x> my boss wants me to make the header and footer appear when the last slide of a page hits. What is the best way to do this without anything crashing?
[07:03:08] <Cork> Whirl3d: i recommend not skipping {} in your if cases
[07:03:24] <Cork> it is very easy to introduce bugs through those
[07:03:38] <Whirl3d> cool. usually I don't. I'll check back through it. Thanks.
[07:03:40] <decx> why not fill an array with object coordinates, do alignment math on that and then feed that into css
[07:03:51] <Whirl3d> errr except if its just return...my bad
[07:03:58] <ericx2x> I was thinking of doing a slide up function but I think that crashes on different screen resolutions since the header and footer changes depending on screen size (because of my media queries)
[07:04:18] <Whirl3d> the alignPosition() object is really cool because it can be reused
[07:05:02] <Whirl3d> the next step (after cleaning things up) is to be able to pass the alignPosition() object to an element to override it's default alignment positoin
[07:07:00] <decx> i don't understand the use ^^
[07:08:31] <Whirl3d> I'll work out an example of how this is useful.
[07:09:55] <Whirl3d> It becomes really useful when you start applying custom vectors...aligning elements radially, for example, is easy like this.
[07:16:05] <gregf_> hi
[07:17:10] <gregf_> i needed to find a div with an attribute style="height: auto;" <== there can be only one div with that attribute set at any point in time :/
[07:17:36] <gregf_> this does not seem to work: $(seriesModelWrapperIdSelector).parent().find('div').style("height: auto"))
[07:17:55] <gregf_> neither does this : $(seriesModelWrapperIdSelector).parent().find('div').css("height: auto"))
[07:18:09] <Cork> greg_f: you really REALLY shouldn't select element based on css values
[07:18:20] <Cork> make a class and use that instead
[07:18:30] <gregf_> ok. well the element has an id as well but thats a dynamic ic :/
[07:18:39] <gregf_> s/ic/id/
[07:18:40] <Cork> .auto_height { height: auto; }
[07:18:53] <Cork> $('.auto_height')
[07:19:23] <greg_f> gregf_: hey bro
[07:19:23] <gregf_> Cork: so i'll have to take off the inline styling?
[07:19:32] <Cork> greg_f: well you don't have to
[07:19:36] <Cork> but you should use a class instead
[07:19:45] <gregf_> ok
[07:19:53] <Cork> cause selecting on style="" isn't a good aproch
[07:20:12] <Cork> *approach
[07:20:34] <gregf_> i know :/. but thats the only attribute thats changing and all the html is dynamic
[07:20:47] <Cork> greg_f: it can still be dynamic
[07:21:02] <Cork> just set the class name instead of the css('height')
[07:21:08] <gregf_> ok
[07:21:26] <gregf_> Cork: Thanks!
[07:21:29] <Cork> np
[07:27:34] <MikeD_> i'm not sure how to use a promise with a function that accept a callback
[07:28:19] <Cork> MikeD_: you normally don't but you could create a promise
[07:28:35] <Cork> give the function a callback that does promise.resolve(value)
[07:30:33] <MikeD_> due to the way this app works, I have a .save() method for my model - and it calls an asych (ajax-like) function for each of 4 pieces of data... I don't want the .save() method to run the callback IT was passed until those 4 callbacks have completed.
[07:30:59] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I checked. an what happened is this. $.get( urlbase/redirectme/dir/index.html ) works with appaches "Redirect /redirectme /targetdir/" but not "Redirect /redirectme ip:8080" which worked also in the browser.
[07:31:24] <Cork> MikeD_: until or after?
[07:31:30] <MikeD_> I didn't think that should be too difficult, but I have somehow broken something and the callback passed to my .save() method doesn't work
[07:31:55] <Cork> workerbeetwo: ah, port redirect would be cross domain redirects
[07:32:04] <Cork> workerbeetwo: and those arn't supported by xhr
[07:32:11] <MikeD_> the 4 asychs finish, then the callback
[07:32:22] <Cork> MikeD_: make a fiddle
[07:33:19] <workerbeetwo> Cork: even though appache is configured to allow cross domain requests?
[07:33:30] <Cork> workerbeetwo: yes
[07:34:51] <workerbeetwo> Cork: so what Im supposed to do now?
[07:35:07] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you could return the new url in the ajax call
[07:35:13] <Cork> and make a new one from the response
[07:35:26] <Cork> that is basically what a redirect does anyway
[07:39:16] <workerbeetwo> Cork: well I could just set the target url right away, which defeats the purpose of using the redirect to circumvent a cross domain request restriction.
[07:39:58] <Cork> workerbeetwo: if you could circumvent the restriction it wouldn't be a restriction :)
[07:42:01] <workerbeetwo> Cork: what I do: siteA (apache) calls by GET -> siteB (tomcat/.../server.war) produces an XML to return it. , but siteB runs on the same machine different port (8080). thus cross domain scripting is detected, which would be ok here.
[07:42:35] <Cork> workerbeetwo: why not just put nginx infront
[07:42:45] <Cork> have both sites live in different paths on port 80
[07:42:52] <Cork> and just not have to deal with that at all?
[07:44:00] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I did not know that is possible.
[07:44:50] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you put nginx infron of apache
[07:45:07] <Cork> have different location /<your path> {}
[07:45:14] <Cork> point to the different apache sites
[07:45:19] <thebloggu> can someone take a look at this code (http://jsfiddle.net/87hR8/1/) and tell me why does the placeholder appears first in my helper?
[07:45:27] <Cork> so the nginx proxies the request
[07:46:32] <workerbeetwo> Cork: where is the server from tomcat?
[07:46:44] <Cork> ?g nginx
[07:46:44] <b-ot> Cork: nginx news → http://nginx.org/
[07:47:08] <BillCriswell> This whole Thor becoming a woman thing seems really insulting to woman to me... and I usually don't say things like that haha
[07:48:24] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I mean , you explained how to make to apache sites run in a paralell using nginx. but here the one site is basicall a java bases appplication as server using tomcat.
[07:48:51] <Cork> workerbeetwo: nginx in this setup is a proxy
[07:48:56] <Cork> you can have anything behind
[07:49:07] <Cork> php, apache, java, python, go ...
[07:49:12] <Cork> thin
[07:49:14] <Cork> and so on
[07:49:32] <Cork> it doens't even have to be on the same machine
[07:49:53] <karamazov> In isolation this works http://jsfiddle.net/3xm3M/ but now that it's on a live site, the DOM isn't being manipulated correctly. Can't seem to figure why $frame is undefined when rotation is called on line 61
[07:50:17] <MikeD_> Can you tell me if this ought to work as I intend?  http://jsfiddle.net/4R487/1/
[07:50:37] <Cork> karamazov: are you waiting for dom ready before you run your code?
[07:50:52] <karamazov> Nope - I need to :)
[07:51:34] <Cork> karamazov: why don't you just use $.Deferred?
[07:51:42] <Cork> or $.callback?
[07:51:53] <karamazov> For?
[07:52:02] <Cork> the promise
[07:52:28] <Cork> i might be reading it wrong though
[07:52:33] <Cork> a little too much of the code is missing
[07:52:45] <karamazov> I didn't intentionally write a promise - I'll update
[07:53:14] <Cork> note i will have to run in a few mins
[07:53:26] <Cork> sop someone else will most likely have to take the rest
[07:53:53] <karamazov> Gotcha - http://jsfiddle.net/3xm3M/1/
[07:54:45] <karamazov> It works solo but when I've tested it on a live sidebar the rotation function doesn't have access to $frame
[07:54:54] <Cork> karamazov: line 171 is calling the plugin from inside a onload event handler
[07:55:06] <Cork> if you put that directly into the page you will have a problem
[07:55:19] <Cork> it should be wrapped inside $(function() {});
[07:55:38] <karamazov> Gotcha - thanks. I need to get a better understanding on loading and dom
[07:57:10] <thebloggu> can someone take a look at this code (http://jsfiddle.net/87hR8/1/) and tell me why does the placeholder appears first in my helper and then in the sortable table?
[07:58:02] <duch_kazatel> $(this).width($(this).width()); wat
[07:58:08] <workerbeetwo> Cork: somehow I figure it is easier to just call a bash-script from javascript which wgets the xml file adn get the fiel from the filesystem thereafter.
[07:58:28] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you can't run bash from javascript ^^'
[07:58:32] <Cork> unless you mean node.js
[07:59:01] <workerbeetwo> Cork: is there a some cooky using way?
[07:59:36] <duch_kazatel> workerbeetwo you cannot run arbitrary scripts on a machine using javascript unless you use Node
[07:59:55] <workerbeetwo> duch_kazatel: thanks. I let go of it.
[08:00:13] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[08:01:39] <MikeD_1> Cork:  did you see my fiddle?
[08:02:04] <karamazov> Bah - when the mousever event gets triggered the rotation function isn't receiving $frame. Any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/3xm3M/2/
[08:02:46] <workerbeetwo> duch_kazatel: siteA needs to get an xml file produced by siteB, but right now they reside on the same machine, different ports, which means cross site scripting is detected and blocking the requests.
[08:03:26] <MikeD_1> workerbeetwo: can you have siteA request the file server-side from siteB ?
[08:03:36] <duch_kazatel> "recieving"?
[08:03:47] <thebloggu> duch_kazatel: that's necessary because the cells shrink in size
[08:04:09] <duch_kazatel> thebloggu you're setting the width of something to its current width.
[08:04:10] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Caught my typo AND my lack of terminology :)
[08:04:24] <duch_kazatel> workerbeetwo you can enable CORS to do it :)
[08:04:34] <thebloggu> duch_kazatel: i know. but try it without it and see for yourself :)
[08:05:48] <duch_kazatel> thebloggu any time you wind up needing code that does things like $(this).width($(this).width));, you might want to reconsider your approach, though that's me being unhelpful :0
[08:06:05] <duch_kazatel> btw if you use git: http://andrew.yurisich.com/work/2014/07/16/dont-link-that-line-number/
[08:07:26] <karamazov> I didn't include the rotate function :)
[08:07:30] <axilla> hi all, how can I have a start and stop event for a drag event.. i want to change the cursor when i start dragging and change the cursor back when i stop
[08:08:19] <thebloggu> duch_kazatel: its a glitch when using sortable tables..
[08:08:27] <workerbeetwo> duch_kazatel: I tried. no success. apache seems to be opened for it. still not working (note that only siteA's code is under my control, the other is a ready to go app server's site).
[08:09:18] <duch_kazatel> workerbeetwo the server you're trying to request data from must explicitly allow it - if the server config (apache level) doesn't allow it, you're hosed.
[08:09:19] <bengalo> axilla whats wrong with start and stop?
[08:10:26] <MikeD_1> workerbeetwo: can you ask siteA to go get content from siteB for you?  (proxy)
[08:10:45] <bengalo> you can use css for that though -> :hover
[08:11:47] <bengalo> but for changing, only when dragging, start and stop seem just fine
[08:12:20] <axilla> yea k
[08:12:21] <axilla> thanks
[08:12:32] <bengalo> css isnt :hover as i mentioned
[08:12:50] <bengalo> if you dont turn it off, items that are dragged will get a class attached
[08:12:55] <bengalo> ui-draggable-dragging
[08:12:57] <decx> is freenode funky for anyone else?
[08:13:06] <duch_kazatel> decx how so?
[08:13:07] <MikeD_1> decx: yes
[08:13:08] <bengalo> you can use that in css
[08:13:12] <decx> had to connect to some esoteric server
[08:13:19] <duch_kazatel> decx weird.
[08:13:31] <decx> all my normal request were disconnected
[08:13:40] <decx> directly works fine but not from my psy bnc
[08:14:45] <MikeD_1> i'm not sure anyone can see what I write
[08:14:51] <duch_kazatel> I can.
[08:14:54] <MikeD_1> k, thanks
[08:19:50] <Whirl3d> if I store an object in an element's data-info property, is there any way for that object to reference the element without explicitly declaring it in the object?
[08:20:23] <MikeD_1> that sounds wrong
[08:20:51] <Whirl3d> I doubt there is, but it's times like this that I don't ask and spend days working around an already simple solution
[08:20:59] <workerbeetwo> duch_kazatel: I guess thats the reason why internet explorer ignores scripting across domains.
[08:23:00] <workerbeetwo> at least it seemed so . ok. anyways. I need to go and thnak you very much!
[08:24:00] <duch_kazatel> workerbeetwo huh?
[08:24:00] <MikeD_1> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/  if my callToAPI() has a callback, should I be using promise?
[08:24:44] <systemfault> MikeD_1: If the function is async, you might benefit from converting it to promise
[08:27:26] <MikeD_1> how do i do that?
[08:27:39] <systemfault> MikeD_1: What is the signature of the function?
[08:27:58] <systemfault> Since jQuery’s promise implementation suck, you’d have to use deferreds
[08:28:10] <MikeD_1> loadCCL( "astring",anArray, callbackfunction, returntype )
[08:28:21] <MikeD_1> deferreds is fine too, idc
[08:29:24] <systemfault> MikeD_1: What are the params to the callback?
[08:29:29] <systemfault> How do you know it failed?
[08:29:36] <systemfault> (Or succeeded)
[08:29:58] <MikeD_1> callbackfunction( data )  - no idea that it failed, it's a poor design.
[08:30:21] <MikeD_1> rather, the underlying implementation is to just yell at you and quit.
[08:30:33] <systemfault> ok :/
[08:30:43] <systemfault> So, there’s no way to handle errors?
[08:31:01] <MikeD_1> no graceful way :)
[08:32:32] <dcherman2> so if it fails, your callback is just never called?
[08:32:38] <MikeD_1> right
[08:33:06] <MikeD_1> and generally the framework throws some ugly error at the user for you
[08:33:28] <MikeD_1> i'd burn it all to the ground and start over atop the ashes if I could
[08:33:57] <MikeD_1> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/jquery-deferreds/
[08:33:58] <systemfault> MikeD_1: http://jsfiddle.net/AGVLB/
[08:35:05] <MikeD_1> thanks, that's what I was missing in all the published examples - how to do that
[08:41:13] <MikeD_1> so now I can wrap them in $.when( myLoadCCL().done(); myLoadCCL().done(); ).done( afterallcompleted() ); ?
[08:41:40] <jParkton> seems so
[08:43:05] <systemfault> No.
[08:43:45] <systemfault> $.when(myLoadCCL(), myLoadCCL()).done(afterAllCompleted);
[08:44:38] <MikeD_1> can I conditionally add those myLoadCCL() deferreds into an array, then pass the array to when() ?
[08:44:55] <systemfault> Only if you use .apply
[08:45:43] <systemfault> It becomes var myArray = [myLoadCCL(), myLoadCCL()]; $.when.apply($, myArray).done(afterAllCompleted);
[08:46:01] <jParkton> funky
[08:46:02] <MikeD_1> awesome.
[08:48:51] <Whirl3d> is there no $(list).map() method? is it only $.map(lst, function() {});
[08:49:19] <decx> there is
[08:49:50] <Whirl3d> I was looking in the api for .fn.map and it wasn't there. Thanks. Sorry for the dumb question
[08:50:14] <jParkton> you guys amaze me
[08:52:51] <MikeD_1> in my current use-case, i don't really even care much about the returned content - but if I was going to use the data in 4 different ways (for 4 different calls to the myLoadCCL() function - do I need to build a different promise generator?
[09:02:46] <salt_> hey, question about iterating over jQuery objects: how do I do it? haha.  Here's what i'm trying to do https://gist.github.com/saltandbeer/3d1e0adb3973304d2f26
[09:03:37] <MikeD_1> salt_: you know jquery will automatically iterate over collections?
[09:03:45] <decx> map returns an array
[09:03:53] <decx> if you don't use that then this wonn't do anything
[09:04:11] <decx> but var mymappeddata = $(selector).map(... will
[09:04:12] <systemfault> salt_: IIRC, $.fn.map is stupid… the first argument is the index.
[09:04:19] <decx> that too
[09:04:27] <systemfault> salt_: Use var link = $(this);
[09:04:27] <decx> just use this
[09:04:50] <decx> time for quakecon
[09:05:57] <MikeD_1> systemfault: if I alert( JSON.stringify( myarray ) ) before  $.when.apply($, myarray).done( cb );  I get the app refresh that's in cb, if i remove the alert, i don't.   any thoughts?  (i'm leaning towards "something is broken")
[09:07:35] <systemfault> MikeD_1: You must have a small bug somewhere.
[09:09:06] <MikeD_1> do you think there's something about the alert() that is relevant to the way this breaks?
[09:09:10] <salt_> decx: was expecting gist, realized you meant this keyword haha,  thanks guys!
[09:09:24] <decx> this is confusing
[09:09:51] <systemfault> MikeD_1: I don’t know… I have no code :/
[09:12:20] <MikeD_1> understood.  this whole thing is made worse by the fact that it's in an embedded instance of IE, so no dev tools either.
[09:27:57] <pu239> i found this fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/petersendidit/gKtXa/5/ that does most of what i want to do, how can i add attributes to the li tag once it is dropped?
[09:29:03] <decx> use the drop event function
[09:33:00] <pu239> decx: thanks, what would cause that to fire twice?
[09:33:01] <decx> nevermind, it's the receive function in the sortable
[09:35:27] <pu239> decx: ah, perfect, thanks
[09:35:32] <pu239> i missed that one
[09:39:34] <hocza> hi
[09:40:01] <hocza> can someone tell me, why should I use this: http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ instead of css background?
[09:40:20] <hocza> oh I may found the answer: Images are fetched after your page is loaded,
[09:40:47] <decx> i dont see a benefit
[09:42:10] <decx> if you use js for background images it might as well be interesting with canvas
[09:44:27] <hocza> kay :)
[09:44:57] <hocza> other topic: do you know any free license (MIT,apache etc...) layer slider?
[09:45:12] <decx> what's a layer slider
[09:45:43] <hocza> http://kreaturamedia.com/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin/
[09:45:44] <hocza> like that
[09:46:56] <decx> i think these timeline enabled sliders are still selling like hotcakes so the drive to actually create an open counterpart just isnt there
[09:47:49] <hocza> ohh yes timeline enabled sliders, thats a way more better name. :)
[09:48:34] <decx> i just made it up but feel free to evangelize it
[09:56:20] <thebloggu> I'm trying to build a sortable selectable table. So far I got to this (http://jsfiddle.net/87hR8/2/). Can you take a look and help me polish it? (one of the issues I have is the placeholder is placed on the helper first and then the original table)
[09:57:21] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/BVmvPm0d   can someone plz help me with this. i couldnt hardly find any examples online about doing this
[09:58:07] <decx> you will feel dumb though
[09:58:13] <decx> it's actually closest
[09:58:33] <AcidRain2012> lol. actually sry. i just changed it to parent
[09:58:54] <decx> oh no it's not inside
[09:58:58] <AcidRain2012> $("div").closest.replaceWith( "<a href='#' id='loaddata>test</a><br>" );
[09:59:00] <decx> then it's prev()
[10:00:10] <decx> what's the usecase anyway, why replace a div with an anchor
[10:00:28] <decx> also you have several getrequest ids, that's invalid
[10:00:40] <hocza> decx: I may found one that fits my requirements. Open source. Sequence.js -> http://www.sequencejs.com/
[10:00:42] <decx> an id is an identifier and as such muts be unique
[10:01:27] <decx> hocza oh right i remember someone coming in here with a problem involving that
[10:02:40] <AcidRain2012> well... what im trying to do is make a ratings system. (which is alrdy created), but i want it to make is so when they click a link, it will rate some content, and update their rating without refreshing the page. the reason i have so many getrequest id's is cause a single page may have 20-50 ratable content. and i have the links that they click on to rate in a div
[10:02:49] <AcidRain2012> figured i would just replace it all with the updated links.
[10:03:14] <AcidRain2012> its little stars. depending on what they rate, a certain star gets highlighted
[10:03:15] <decx> regardless, you cant have more than one element with the same id
[10:03:26] <decx> but you shouldnt have to replace an element for that
[10:03:38] <AcidRain2012> what is your suggestion?
[10:04:10] <decx> i can extract a ratingsscript mom
[10:04:33] <AcidRain2012> lol
[10:20:12] <decx> man when did i write that
[10:20:28] <decx> must have been drunk
[10:22:31] <jeffreylevesque> if my index.php has defines external <script>, and this script saves a reference of another script to a variable (i.e. var WORKER = "path/to/myScript.js"), does the reference (var WORKER) have to be relative to index.php, or the external <script>.  My real question is, does this vary between systems (mac, ubuntu)?
[10:25:10] <thebloggu> I'm trying to build a sortable selectable table. So far I got to this (http://jsfiddle.net/87hR8/2/). Can you take a look and help me polish it? (one of the issues I have is the placeholder is placed on the helper first and then the original table)
[10:27:10] <MikeD_1> http://jsfiddle.net/AGVLB/1/
[10:27:22] <decx> AcidRain2012 found the old rating thing i did and cleaned it up a bit http://jsfiddle.net/decx/95cjX/
[10:34:13] <MikeD_1> .done( function(){ alert( mycallback ); mycallback(); } );  <-- the alert shows the correct function body/definition, but it doesn't execute.  Any ideas?
[10:34:30] <duch_kazatel> don't use alerts.  use console.log();
[10:34:43] <MikeD_1> i don't have a console
[10:35:09] <duch_kazatel> oh that embedded IE thing?
[10:35:25] <MikeD_1> yeah
[10:35:32] <decx> embedded ie?
[10:35:37] <decx> kill meeeeee
[10:36:18] <MikeD_1> a win32 app that instances IE... and it's in a VM that I see through Citrix.    yeah, go home early and drink until I forget is looking better and better.
[10:37:00] <decx> yeah time to go all out on pure ethanol
[10:37:15] <MikeD_1> instead of console.log, i can use document.title...
[10:37:55] <MikeD_1> ... same issue, the function body is displayed, but mycallback() doesn't execute.
[10:40:05] <MikeD_1> the really odd part is that if I put an alert before the $.when() and watch document.title until the 4 promise.done() fire - then click the alert... the when.done( mycallback() }  DOES execute.
[10:40:07] <BillCriswell> MikeD_1: What does typeof mycallback return?
[10:40:18] <MikeD_1> function
[10:44:01] <DeliriumTremens> so same origin policy won't let me capture a submit launched from an iframe if that iframe is loaded from another domain, right?
[10:45:22] <MikeD_1> should an alert be able to block the execution of the .when()'s .done() ?   while the alert is on the screen, i'm seeing the promise.done( ) firing [writing to document.title]  but the final .done() doesn't happen until after i click the alert ok
[10:45:38] <MikeD_1> or am I chasing a misfeature of IE?
[10:46:06] <systemfault> alert is blocking, indeed.
[10:47:11] <MikeD_1> so it's blocking the execution before when(), so by the time I resume execution the promises are in a resolved state
[10:52:31] <jailbot> hi
[10:52:35] <jailbot> https://gist.github.com/jailbot/ca888f89743897f79187
[10:52:42] <jailbot> this sends an error
[10:53:05] <jailbot> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[10:53:24] <jailbot> as I resize my browser
[10:55:18] <djQuery> jailbot, how many times do you think browser resize fires?
[10:55:24] <jailbot> 40+
[10:55:28] <jailbot> a lot
[10:55:37] <djQuery> so on every browser resize you are creating a settimeout?
[10:55:51] <djQuery> so you have 40+ settimeouts waiting?
[10:55:57] <jailbot> thats not the problem
[10:56:02] <jailbot> it still errors without that
[10:56:23] <jailbot> isn’t this pretty typical responsive functionality?
[10:57:07] <djQuery> jailbot, so settext is recursevly calling settext with no way to get out of it
[10:57:08] <jailbot> I got it
[10:57:15] <jailbot> yeah thanks man
[10:57:19] <jailbot> stupid mistake
[10:57:40] <jailbot> its beautiful <3
[10:59:20] <decx> settimeouts for resize -.-
[10:59:40] <jailbot> idk I was just google for an answer
[10:59:48] <jailbot> DONT YOU JUDGE ME DECX
[10:59:52] <djQuery> decx, jailbot, at least cancel timeout then set it
[11:00:10] <jailbot> eh it works
[11:00:17] <jailbot> its just for JS practice
[11:00:19] <decx> i prefer to define breakpoints, then you can just run the new window size againts the breakpoints and if it reached a new threshold you can execute a function
[11:00:32] <duch_kazatel> "eh it works" and "its just for JS practice" are at odds.
[11:00:42] <duch_kazatel> if you're practicing/learning, learn how to do it the right way.
[11:00:50] <jailbot> hackhackhack
[11:00:55] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, +++
[11:01:03] <jailbot> so whats the right way
[11:01:19] <decx> timeout based resize debounce is probably more common
[11:01:36] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[11:01:39] <jailbot> > debounce
[11:01:42] <jailbot> wut?
[11:01:58] <decx> it's a good keyword to search for on that topic
[11:02:00] <djQuery> ?g timeout based resize debounce
[11:02:02] <b-ot> djQuery: Debounced resize() jQuery plugin - Paul Irish → http://paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/
[11:02:06] <decx> events executing too often
[11:02:07] <duch_kazatel> http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[11:02:20] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[11:02:33] <duch_kazatel> basically, limit the number of times a function can run.
[11:02:39] <decx> i like breakpoints & thresholds more
[11:02:44] <jailbot> jesus
[11:02:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah CSS is good times
[11:02:59] <decx> getting the window size isnt that expensive
[11:03:04] <djQuery> have you ever had fun when someone puts fun on one of the slides
[11:03:52] <jailbot> how would you get the mouse position
[11:04:15] <jailbot> is there something easy you can target with $()
[11:04:26] <decx> what do you want to do
[11:05:12] <jailbot> some parallax nonsense
[11:05:19] <jailbot> i’ve already got the window size
[11:05:28] <jailbot> now I want to find the cursor position
[11:06:25] <decx> i dont have to give you relevant keywords for that
[11:06:33] <decx> come on ;)
[11:06:38] <duch_kazatel> that's a pretty easy google search.
[11:06:54] <jailbot> :)
[11:06:58] <jailbot> i’m googling
[11:07:08] <jailbot> you guys said learn best practice tho
[11:08:33] <duch_kazatel> you're at that point in the learning process where you need to get the basics first.
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> and part of that is making mistakes and figuring it out.
[11:09:01] <jailbot> kk ty
[11:09:07] <jailbot> i’m going to leave
[11:09:14] <jailbot> but I dont want to sound rude
[11:09:19] <jailbot> thanks for your help
[11:09:23] <duch_kazatel> not rude at all.
[11:09:29] <duch_kazatel> it's not a personal thing at all :)
[11:09:44] <duch_kazatel> aaaand gone.
[11:09:45] <decx> i want to sound rude, but i'm german so there's that
[11:09:51] <duch_kazatel> so you do no matter what?
[11:09:57] <decx> we're not all smiles and sunshine
[11:10:02] <duch_kazatel> BETTER THAN THOSE DAMNED AUSTRIANS.
[11:10:55] <decx> cool effect http://jsfiddle.net/decx/GL2Xb/
[11:11:50] <duch_kazatel> woah
[11:13:19] <decx> clicking in a blank space while the old click is growing yields some itneresting results
[11:14:14] <duch_kazatel> or double-clicking
[11:23:00] <oal> I need to call .datepicker() on an element that isn't present at page load (loaded with .load()). How can I do that?
[11:23:34] <duch_kazatel> .load() should have a callback for when it finishes
[11:24:15] <oal> So I can't "listen" for this class to appear from elsewhere?
[11:24:20] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:24:34] <duch_kazatel> not without using mutation observers, but that's a bad idea.
[11:26:04] <oal> ok
[11:45:35] <pu239> i'm doing something stupid, i'm trying to change data-id, item.data('id', 'zzzzz')
[11:45:46] <duch_kazatel> that'll do it.
[11:46:07] <pu239> i can write item.data('id') to the console and see zzzzz, but when i look at the source it's still the old value
[11:46:20] <pu239> should i be able to change that?
[11:46:21] <duch_kazatel> .data() doesn't edit the actual html.
[11:46:27] <duch_kazatel> it's cached elsehwere to make it faster.
[11:46:38] <pu239> that makes more sense now
[11:47:15] <pu239> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[11:47:22] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[11:56:24] <BillCriswell> My attention span today is shorter than normal.
[11:56:50] <jimi_> What's the best way to do this? I want to fire an event on a draggable element being dragged and dropped. Should I fire on dragstop and detect if placed on droppable area, or fire on drop on the droppable element and then update the dragged element?
[11:57:54] <jailbot> hey guys
[11:58:02] <jailbot> another semi-stupid question
[11:58:03] <jailbot> https://gist.github.com/jailbot/a8ab0681b5aeee57a60f
[11:58:21] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting $("#layer1").css("left").replace(/[^-\d\.]/g, ''); to be?
[11:58:24] <jailbot> im trying to only get the original value
[11:58:37] <jailbot> left: 90px;
[11:58:37] <duch_kazatel> what kind of element is it?
[11:58:39] <decx> you can do that in one css
[11:58:43] <jailbot> I want just 90
[11:59:02] <jailbot> thats part of a larger function
[11:59:30] <decx> .css('left',function(index,value){ var newval = value +1; return newval })
[11:59:40] <jailbot> but you see the problem right
[11:59:43] <decx> probably have to replace px
[11:59:55] <jailbot> thats what the regex is for
[12:00:01] <jailbot> I only want the original value
[12:00:07] <jailbot> as a baseline
[12:00:17] <jailbot> I just want it once
[12:00:17] <duch_kazatel> then you want to use .replace('px', '');
[12:00:19] <decx> it value in that example
[12:00:29] <decx> function(index,value) <
[12:00:31] <jailbot> ohhhh yeah thats much better
[12:00:40] <duch_kazatel> or do what decx is telling you.
[12:00:43] <decx> both
[12:00:52] <jailbot> hmm
[12:01:21] <decx> index is for when you apply css to a collection
[12:01:23] <jailbot> value would be the original “left” value?
[12:01:35] <decx> yes
[12:01:43] <jailbot> ok let me play around
[12:03:44] <decx> i made a fiddle with that just the other day
[12:04:09] <decx> fiddle needs a search function in the dashboard for unnamed snippets
[12:04:11] <decx> -.-
[12:04:35] <decx> i have 20 pages of fiddles and regulary clean up
[12:05:51] <decx> so if somebody makes a fiddle clone with that i will give you like 3-5$/month
[12:06:08] <jailbot> the thing is recursive thats the problem
[12:06:19] <duch_kazatel> i always forget to save them, and when i do i realize my real name is attached to them and making another account requires too much effort.
[12:06:39] <jailbot> function(index,value), where value is the current left offset
[12:06:47] <decx> finding unaccounted fiddles without a name is indeed a bitch
[12:07:24] <duch_kazatel> jailbot huh?
[12:07:45] <decx> left offset is not positions left
[12:07:49] <jailbot> yeah
[12:07:49] <decx> sooo
[12:07:51] <jailbot> true
[12:07:53] <decx> what do you mean
[12:08:01] <jailbot> lets say left is 50px
[12:08:07] <jailbot> it adds 20px
[12:08:13] <jailbot> new value is 70px
[12:08:21] <jailbot> lets say left is 70px
[12:08:24] <jailbot> it adds 20px
[12:08:31] <jailbot> new value is 90px
[12:08:39] <jailbot> I want the left to remain 50px
[12:08:48] <vivekrai> Hi all,
[12:08:56] <jailbot> and have it add/subtract 20 from just the original value
[12:09:00] <vivekrai> I am trying to dynamically insert a canvas tag into DOM.
[12:09:27] <decx> just do it vivekrai
[12:09:36] <jailbot> basicly I want it to run $(“#layer”).css(“left”); once
[12:09:45] <jailbot> to get the original
[12:09:57] <vivekrai> decx: but the closing tag </canvas> doesn't show up.
[12:10:33] <decx> then you do something strange
[12:10:34] <decx> fiddle up
[12:10:49] <jParkton> lol
[12:11:58] <jailbot> so how would I call that function only once
[12:12:19] <decx> so you want to alternate from 70 to 20
[12:12:23] <decx> 30*
[12:13:03] <jailbot> oh wait

[12:13:32] <jailbot> this is trippy
[12:13:34] <vivekrai> Inspect element the canvas and see that there is no closing tag.
[12:14:05] <decx> there is
[12:14:10] <duch_kazatel> i see it.
[12:14:20] <decx> fragments get their closing tags automagically
[12:14:40] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/UtlACDd.png <- closes just fine.
[12:14:53] <decx> but i would just use document.createElement('canvas'); for a canvas anyway
[12:14:59] <decx> you can append that just fine
[12:16:06] <vivekrai> duch_kazatel: Weird. I don't see that.
[12:16:10] <vivekrai> It's very clear in your screenshot.
[12:20:25] <duch_kazatel> vivekrai what browser are you using?
[12:20:59] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, what extensions are you running in chrome? I like the dark dev tools
[12:21:20] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d i don't use chrome ;)
[12:21:31] <duch_kazatel> that's the native dark theme for FFs dev tools.
[12:21:56] <Whirl3d> Doh! When did firefox start looking just like hrome? Weird
[12:22:24] <Whirl3d> cool. thanks. good to know
[12:22:26] <duch_kazatel> the native dev tools have been around for a looooong time.
[12:22:33] <duch_kazatel> i finally ditched firebug for the,.
[12:22:35] <decx> it's impossible to look just like chrome because chromes devtools are so void of identity that they change every 5 seconds
[12:22:54] <duch_kazatel> FFs have some weird little bits, but otherwise should be fine.
[12:23:10] <Whirl3d> decx, why the hate?
[12:23:33] <decx> because i don't like things that are different
[12:23:44] <duch_kazatel> chrome changes ALL the time.
[12:24:08] <Whirl3d> Wow. I use Chrome Canary every day and hadn't noticed really.
[12:24:13] <decx> schroedingers emulation button
[12:24:35] <jParkton> lol
[12:26:28] <Whirl3d> I just got to thinking and I haven't launched firefox even once in the last 5 years that I didn't have to wait for it to update. Firefox is much more volatile than Chrome in my experience
[12:27:50] <duch_kazatel> not for me.
[12:28:00] <duch_kazatel> very few changes except for aurora.
[12:28:26] <djQuery> for me its that I dont launch FF but once a month if that
[12:28:29] <jParkton> AA dark dev tools?
[12:28:33] <jParkton> wth
[12:28:55] <duch_kazatel> plus the autoupdater is cleaner now.  rarely have to wait on launch any more.
[12:29:52] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/p8u9P59L   ugh. a little progress, i have made
[12:29:58] <AcidRain2012> any help would be much appreciated
[12:30:47] <decx> $(this) in your callback isnt .ratings anymore
[12:31:44] <AcidRain2012> not sure i am understanding. why is it not .ratings?
[12:32:39] <decx> console.log(this) inside and see
[12:33:15] <AcidRain2012> where do i see this output at?
[12:33:23] <decx> what browser?
[12:34:19] <AcidRain2012> oh firefox. i found out how
[12:34:24] <vivekrai> decx: Chrome 36
[12:35:16] <decx> not you, but do you do with canvas anyway vivekrai
[12:35:19] <decx> what*
[12:35:21] <NoiseEee> vivekrai: i wouldn't worry so much about seeing closing tags in the DOM
[12:35:36] <NoiseEee> if you're adding the element via JS, the element is there
[12:35:48] <NoiseEee> as you can see if you console.log('#123')
[12:35:51] <NoiseEee> or whatever
[12:36:16] <vivekrai> decx: Trying to generate a Gene graphic using a library (Scribl)
[12:36:45] <vivekrai> NoiseEee: Thanks. May be I am missing on something else. I will figure out. Thanks for clarification :)
[12:36:46] <decx> that sounds cool
[12:37:11] <vivekrai> decx: Thanks for clarifying.
[12:37:28] <decx> i wouldnt put the var canvas in a jquery object btw, it's more convenient vanilla
[12:37:56] <AcidRain2012> ok. (this) refers to the data function. how do i pass this to function(data)?
[12:38:32] <decx> lucky for you that is a common question and i have a fiddle with your options AcidRain2012 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/qZcY8/
[12:39:07] <AcidRain2012> lol. nice

[12:47:14] <inv3nt0r> Good afternoon from Canada everyone!
[12:48:17] <inv3nt0r> Quick question if anyone cares to look... I am trying to implement a 'lightbox' using prettyPhoto. The lightbox functions, but prettyPhoto seems to ignore the gallery tag, ie: rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]"
[12:48:34] <inv3nt0r> I'm using jQuery 1.11 which as far as I can tell is supported. Any thoughts?
[12:48:56] <decx> are the links on the page at load?
[12:49:03] <ericx2x> how do i set margin-bottom with jquery? I have $('#neo_footer').css("margin-bottom", -100+'px');
[12:49:06] <ericx2x> but it doesn't work
[12:49:13] <ericx2x> what's wrong with that statement?
[12:49:29] <AcidRain2012> decx, ok one more question for you. how would a pass a few variables to the function?
[12:49:49] <inv3nt0r> $('#neo_footer').css("margin-bottom", "-100");
[12:50:11] <inv3nt0r> Try that... If that doesn't work put px on the end
[12:50:19] <inv3nt0r> $('#neo_footer').css("margin-bottom", "-100px");
[12:50:50] <decx> do you want to set it to -100 or substract 100?
[12:51:05] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/82Si66SL   <--- here is what i got now. i need to pass 2 variables. an id, and a.... rating.
[12:51:54] <ericx2x> I want to subtract 100
[12:52:49] <decx> the syntax for that is a bit weird
[12:52:56] <decx> , "-=100px"

[13:28:13] <AcidRain2012> <div class='rating'><span></span>     how do i detect a link click inside of span?   $(".ratings").click(function(){
[13:30:05] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: a link or a click?
[13:30:19] <Blaster> If I have several JS files, how do I share functions between them, if each one has a separate $(function() { .... }); ?
[13:30:26] <AcidRain2012> sry. an onClick for a link. yes link
[13:31:04] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: so that <span> is really an <a> or can you rephrase your question
[13:31:43] <AcidRain2012> no sry. it looks like this: <div class='rating'><span><a href='#' onClick='myfunction(92,5)'>
[13:34:24] <AcidRain2012> i guess i dont need that at all. since the onClick is calling the function
[13:34:43] <AcidRain2012> ah. i do need it
[13:35:56] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/2i8PhN94   <---
[13:40:18] <NoiseEee> you should not have any inline JS
[13:40:28] <NoiseEee> take out the onClick
[13:40:41] <AcidRain2012> how would i pass vars to the function then?
[13:40:51] <NoiseEee> where are those vars coming from?
[13:41:04] <AcidRain2012> from a php script
[13:41:09] <NoiseEee> but what is 92?  what is 5?
[13:41:25] <NoiseEee> ideally you put those values somewhere relevant, either in a data- attribute or elsewhere
[13:41:25] <AcidRain2012> 92 is a beat id from sql db, 5 is the rating. 5-1
[13:41:45] <jParkton> oof
[13:41:54] <AcidRain2012> hmmm... what is this data attri u speak of?
[13:41:56] <jParkton> dont put your sql info in a clear file
[13:42:04] <jParkton> askin for issues
[13:42:25] <AcidRain2012> jParkton im in rage right now. forgive me if i go off on u. lol
[13:42:35] <jParkton> lol
[13:42:36] <simsketch_> anyone know how to pull an image link out of a JSON string?
[13:42:43] <NoiseEee> <div class='rating' data-dbreference='92' rating='5'><span><a href='#'>CLICK ME</a></span></div> @ AcidRain2012
[13:42:50] <jParkton> link the json
[13:43:16] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: what jParkton advises is true; better a token that references dbID 92, ie: in the db row, there is a token like '9xjaiojsojasd0' and you pass/lookup that
[13:43:32] <NoiseEee> but assuming that'll come...
[13:43:43] <simsketch_> jParktin: sorry?
[13:44:07] <jParkton> simsketch_: pretty hard to tell you how to call it without seeing the originating data
[13:44:42] <NoiseEee> $('div.rating span a').on('click',function(e) { // get the data-db and data-rating values here by querying closest div, and use them to call myFunction(varA,varB) });
[13:44:44] <AcidRain2012> NoiseEee wait. hold up. sry man. that wont work. let me show u more code
[13:45:10] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: the main thing is to lose any inline JS.  its simply not tolerable in 2014 / will mess up too many things
[13:48:24] <jParkton> simsketch_: $.getJSON(data);
[13:48:42] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/yvqfkiDn <--- with explanation on why above code doesnt work
[13:48:47] <jParkton> then add a callback to split that content and get the attr('img')
[13:49:15] <AcidRain2012> lol
[13:49:31] <AcidRain2012> ignore my sad attempt at determining if the link was clicked
[13:51:15] <jParkton> also that data is going to be tricky
[13:51:30] <duch_kazatel> use .prop(), not .attr() btw
[13:51:35] <jParkton> also invalid
[13:51:45] <duch_kazatel> $(".ratings").("span").("a").click(function(){ wat
[13:51:50] <AcidRain2012> lulz
[13:51:54] <duch_kazatel> onClick='myfunction(92,5)'> :(
[13:52:04] <AcidRain2012> man i gotta work at one thing at a time here :(
[13:52:07] <duch_kazatel> check out event delegation.
[13:52:15] <duch_kazatel> drop all the onClick= stuff.
[13:52:49] <AcidRain2012> thats what im tryin to do. but   $("div.ratings span a").click(function(){ does not fire
[13:52:52] <duch_kazatel> $('.rating').on('click', 'span a', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* other code here */ });
[13:53:01] <duch_kazatel> ps your HTML is <div class='rating'>
[13:53:10] <duch_kazatel> not ratings.
[13:53:20] <duch_kazatel> also: font tags :(
[13:53:38] <AcidRain2012> duch_kazatel lol. one thing at a time bro. no need to facepalm all my code ;p
[13:53:45] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: write those variables to a data attribute on the span, or on the <a> itself
[13:54:12] <NoiseEee> AcidRain2012: but honestly with your inlineJS and <font> tags i gotta wonder if you've done any web stuff in the last 5-10 years
[13:54:24] <duch_kazatel> also, your onclick is attaching an event handler that's invalid.
[13:56:43] <ericx2x> Can you guys help review a javascript file I wrote? It's a basic file but I'm sort of new to Jquery so I don't know if there are any things that look strange in there. The file itself seems to work well. http://pastebin.com/0f5p7RH3
[13:56:53] <duch_kazatel> AcidRain2012 http://jsfiddle.net/z87d9/
[13:57:00] <duch_kazatel> and not i'm off to a meeting.
[13:57:23] <duch_kazatel> btw AcidRain2012 you'll have to make some more tweaks to that, but start there.
[14:04:42] <cliffreich> guys i have an easier question
[14:05:05] <cliffreich> jquery isnt setting the right format with this line $('input[type=calendar]').datepicker({dateFormat: "d-m-yy"});
[14:05:21] <cliffreich> it does send 2014-07-30
[14:05:25] <AcidRain2012> http://jsfiddle.net/z87d9/ lol. this doesnt fire on the click either
[14:06:37] <decx> interesting choice of colour for the text
[14:07:59] <cliffreich> no help
[14:08:04] <cliffreich> :(
[14:10:04] <PantsOfChoco> doesnt date format just change the way its displayed to the user?
[14:13:03] <AcidRain2012> ill be back later to deal with this issue. im gonna chill n smoke on it
[14:13:27] <cliffreich> oh wait, it was the stupid cache
[14:13:30] <cliffreich> no problem
[14:13:48] <cliffreich> well i guess ill just leave it with jquery calendar
[14:13:56] <cliffreich> no reason for html5 + jquery
[14:14:02] <cliffreich> and setting 2 shits
[14:14:08] <cliffreich> for format
[14:39:34] <DeliriumTremens> Domain A has an iframe loaded from Domain B (could be any domain).  Domain B submits a previously unknown form to Domain A which in turn causes the parent page from Domain A to unload. Is it at all possible to tell when this happens vs. say a page reload, or following a link on the page?
[14:53:24] <duch_kazatel> AcidRain2012 http://jsfiddle.net/z87d9/3/
[14:53:36] <duch_kazatel> not that hard to include jquery yourself ;)
[14:56:19] <guzzlefry> Is there a best practice for holding onto a DOM element as a template?
[14:57:02] <guzzlefry> Example: A message notification popup div.
[14:57:28] <guzzlefry> I'm using a hidden <div> right now that I clone from, but I'm wondering if there's a better way.
[14:58:02] <Zzaichik> That's how most lightboxes work.
[14:58:12] <duch_kazatel> a document fragment.
[14:58:47] <Matt_Ricketts> I have 5 buttons with the same class.  4 are hidden and 1 is visible.  Is there any way that I can trigger a click on ONLY the visible button with that class?
[14:59:00] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[14:59:14] <decx> how do you click a hidden button anyway
[14:59:15] <duch_kazatel> $('.parent').on('click', '.activeClass', function() {});
[15:00:40] <Matt_Ricketts> $('.button-class').trigger('click');   -- will that trigger a click on my hidden buttons as well?
[15:00:49] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:01:52] <Matt_Ricketts> so you're saying I need to give the visible one an .activeClass and then run my stuff on only the active button?
[15:02:14] <Zzaichik> ^^ that would be a good way to go.
[15:02:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?  can you provide an example of what you're doing?
[15:02:30] <Zzaichik> give the visible on a unique classname that is showing it with CSS
[15:03:18] <Zzaichik> OR - you might benefit from using $(this) so that it correlates with the one that was clicked. Depending on what you're trying to do.
[15:03:50] <Matt_Ricketts> hm
[15:05:03] <Matt_Ricketts> Thanks I'll try adding an active class to the one visible button and only trigger my click on that one.
[15:05:05] <Zzaichik> $('.button').click(function() { $(this).attr('style', 'color:red'); });
[15:05:17] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr()
[15:05:20] <duch_kazatel> use .css() in this case.
[15:05:23] <Zzaichik> .css(); yeah
[15:05:25] <Zzaichik> fine
[15:05:28] <Zzaichik> lol
[15:05:32] <duch_kazatel> in cases where you're editing attributes, use .prop() instead.
[15:05:37] <Zzaichik> that was just an example
[15:05:39] <duch_kazatel> .attr() is not usually what you want.
[15:06:19] <Zzaichik> .prop() works the same way?
[15:06:26] <duch_kazatel> .prop() edits the DOM.
[15:06:29] <duch_kazatel> .attr() edits the markup.
[15:06:35] <duch_kazatel> you usually want the former, not the latter.
[15:06:35] <Zzaichik> interesting
[15:09:11] <duch_kazatel> generally if you want to change the display of stuff, you should add/remove classes instead.
[15:14:50] <Zzaichik> So if I wanted to add, let's say, an id, .prop('id', 'myNewId'); would be the recommended approach
[15:15:03] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:15:21] <decx> what's the usecase for changing an id
[15:15:37] <decx> seems counterintuitive to me
[15:15:42] <duch_kazatel> ^^ there's a reason there's no convenience method for it.
[15:15:50] <duch_kazatel> plus you lose out on being able to cache that selector.,
[15:16:52] <Zzaichik> changing an id would probably not be a well thought out plan
[15:16:55] <Zzaichik> haha
[15:17:27] <Zzaichik> my examples just suck apparently.
[15:17:47] <duch_kazatel> nah, you're just learning :)
[15:17:59] <duch_kazatel> we all are - decx is great at making me look monumentally stupid sometimes :)
[15:18:08] <Zzaichik> haha
[15:18:21] <decx> good

[15:40:57] <duch_kazatel> if I wasn't at work, i'd watch ;)
[15:41:02] <karamazov> Apparently, it's going to be reviewed.
[15:41:41] <duch_kazatel> karamazov sure.  one sec.
[15:41:42] <Zzaichik> only like 20 more minutes for me! Then I can go home.. and probably get back on the internets
[15:42:12] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Thanks! I'm a bit worried - just want to make sure that I won't get the axe :)
[15:42:32] <duch_kazatel> karamazov first question - you have rotation = function() { and rotationBack = function() { - they are almost identical.
[15:43:08] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Yeah - I need the rotation to go right and left twice. Couldn't figure out how else to do with without callbacks.
[15:43:24] <karamazov> *do it without callbacks.
[15:43:28] <duch_kazatel> create a partial.
[15:43:58] <duch_kazatel> i assume "rotation" goes forward, right?
[15:44:09] <karamazov> Yup
[15:44:16] <duch_kazatel> okay, let me show you the idea.
[15:44:22] <karamazov> Cool!

[15:45:33] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: I'll make those names more semantic too. Bad wording on my part
[15:45:44] <duch_kazatel> karamazov that's part of what i'm doing :)
[15:46:00] <jenia> i want to make an ajax call to the server and replace the content of [data-role=page] with what ever the server returns
[15:46:01] <karamazov> haha - it was a really late night last night.
[15:46:11] <jenia> is that possible?
[15:46:46] <karamazov> jenia: Is it possible with ajax or with jquery-mobile?
[15:46:56] <duch_kazatel> jenca you can do that, sure.
[15:46:59] <jenia> any. the simpler solution
[15:47:07] <duch_kazatel> jenia i mean.
[15:47:09] <jenia> how?
[15:47:59] <duch_kazatel> the docs tell you how iirc.
[15:49:33] <duch_kazatel> karamazov http://fixee.org/paste/icmi4x6/
[15:49:43] <duch_kazatel> this could be further reduced down, but you get the idea.
[15:50:04] <duch_kazatel> wait woops http://fixee.org/paste/icmi4x6/#url=zqcs52p
[15:50:06] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[15:50:34] <duch_kazatel> you could also include your rotateHome one in there.
[15:50:50] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: This is awesome - still processing it
[15:50:56] <dinho> no cu babalu
[15:53:36] <duch_kazatel> we were on the wrong side of that one.
[15:53:55] <duch_kazatel> weeee!
[15:58:25] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: What's the frame.rotate(configObject) for?
[15:58:25] <karamazov> it keeeeeps going
[15:59:39] <duch_kazatel> instead of passing the config object inline, you're storing that adata in configObject and then passing that for that rotate() method.
[16:00:23] <karamazov> Never gonna give you up
[16:00:30] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:00:37] <karamazov> Never gonna let you down
[16:00:43] <karamazov> Did my rick roll stop the roll?
[16:00:47] <karamazov> I think I get it
[16:00:54] <karamazov> just never seen frame before
[16:01:59] <duch_kazatel> that's in your code...
[16:03:01] <karamazov> oh haha...opps
[16:03:11] <karamazov> I forgot that was a variable.
[16:03:15] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:03:24] <karamazov> I just took all the $ off the vars
[16:03:37] <duch_kazatel> .... why?
[16:03:45] <duch_kazatel> slap that in front of all jquery object.
[16:03:49] <duch_kazatel> *objects
[16:03:58] <karamazov> Someone told me the $ was reserved for object holders and not vars
[16:04:12] <duch_kazatel> they're wrong.
[16:04:19] <PantsOfChoco> duch knows all
[16:04:22] <PantsOfChoco> and sees all
[16:04:32] <karamazov> I believe it.
[16:04:52] <duch_kazatel> almost all javascripters I've met use $ in front of variable names to denote that's a jquery object.
[16:04:59] <duch_kazatel> it's not reserved in JS.
[16:05:08] <karamazov> does JS count booleans as objects?
[16:05:22] <duch_kazatel> JS counts everything as objects.
[16:05:26] <duch_kazatel> functions, arrays, etc.
[16:05:34] <duch_kazatel> except for primitives, until you use them.
[16:05:56] <karamazov> well - I'll add those back in. It does get confusing with them...as I just demonstrated.
[16:06:21] <karamazov> So that partial naturally loops?
[16:06:28] <duch_kazatel> do what now?
[16:06:39] <karamazov> haha.
[16:06:46] <duch_kazatel> all I did was move logic around.
[16:06:57] <karamazov> So it's supposed to rotate until animation is at 5
[16:07:00] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't be functionally different.
[16:07:17] <duch_kazatel> just need to swap out your calls to the other functions.
[16:07:38] <karamazov> I'm gonna give it a go real quick
[16:10:42] <duch_kazatel> like I said, you'll need to update your function calls.
[16:11:10] <karamazov> Gladly, wtf was my logic last night...
[16:11:23] <duch_kazatel> we all do that ;)
[16:11:24] <guzzlefry> well, this is a mess...including two versions of jQuery.
[16:11:25] <duch_kazatel> you're fine.
[16:11:55] <guzzlefry> Moving from 1.7 to 1.11 is likely to break things, correct?
[16:12:02] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[16:12:04] <duch_kazatel> depending.
[16:12:18] <duch_kazatel> i did a big upgrade from 1.8.3 to 1.11 recently.
[16:12:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[16:12:54] <duch_kazatel> say hello to your new best friend.
[16:14:49] <guzzlefry> I don't suppose there's a clever way to get colorbox working when loading two different jquery versions?
[16:14:57] <duch_kazatel> D:
[16:15:09] <guzzlefry> Upgrading really isn't an option given time constraints. :/
[16:15:11] <duch_kazatel> noconflict one version
[16:15:22] <duch_kazatel> but that'll still require running through your codebase.
[16:15:41] <Matt_Ricketts> I'm trying to pass an argument to my event handler via trigger click but when I console log that variable in my event handler it says undefined.  Any idea where I'm going wrong?  http://pastebin.com/JKYDqmkU
[16:16:41] <duch_kazatel> Matt_Ricketts function (e, nickOriginalVal) { not this - just function (e) {
[16:17:06] <duch_kazatel> then you access that value via event.data
[16:17:34] <Matt_Ricketts> so i don't need to add nickOriginalVal as an argument in taht function?
[16:17:39] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:17:45] <duch_kazatel> because it's passed as apart of the event object.
[16:17:57] <Matt_Ricketts> ok will try that now, thank you
[16:18:01] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler - "Data to be passed to the handler in event.data when an event is triggered.
[16:20:47] <Matt_Ricketts> Oh, so I put the argument I'm passing before the function...
[16:21:04] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:21:50] <svetlana> how do I set an input of type radio's label using jquery? .label('label here') is not a function, do i use .setAttr('label','label here')?
[16:22:03] <duch_kazatel> .prop('label', 'label here')
[16:25:25] <guzzlefry> err, should $.jquery be undefined?
[16:25:35] <duch_kazatel> bwuh?
[16:25:39] <duch_kazatel> you want either $ or jQuery
[16:26:10] <guzzlefry> The .jquery property is assigned to the jQuery prototype, commonly referred to by its alias $.fn. It is a string containing the version number of jQuery, such as "1.5.0" or "1.4.4".
[16:26:13] <guzzlefry> ^ that
[16:26:33] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't be, no.
[16:26:43] <duch_kazatel> see if you can access $ or jQuery
[16:26:49] <guzzlefry> yeah...somethin ain't right
[16:27:23] <guzzlefry> typing either of those in the console returns function(a, b)
[16:27:34] <duch_kazatel> that's different.
[16:28:01] <duch_kazatel> try jQuery.jquery
[16:28:13] <svetlana> duch_kazatel: you're wonderful :)
[16:28:23] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry wait you want $.fn.jquery
[16:28:43] <duch_kazatel> svetlana i'm aware ;)
[16:29:22] <guzzlefry> ah ha, thanks :)
[16:29:36] <guzzlefry> So that's showing the older 1.7.1 version.
[16:29:40] <karamazov> What indentation do most js programmers use?
[16:29:44] <karamazov> is it 4?
[16:29:52] <duch_kazatel> karamazov depends on who you ask :)
[16:29:54] <duch_kazatel> i used tabs.
[16:30:09] <karamazov> I'm used to my 2 space indentation but your tabs looked nice
[16:30:45] <duch_kazatel> you said this is at an employer?
[16:31:17] <karamazov> Yeah - I'm a freelancer. Sent them the mock site with the plugin being used and the CTO responded that he can't wait to read the code.
[16:31:25] <karamazov> Didn't know it was going to be analyzed by a...CTO
[16:31:31] <duch_kazatel> hah
[16:31:48] <duch_kazatel> use whatever format is already prevalent there.  if you can't know that/don't know that/whatever, then choose your own.
[16:32:08] <duch_kazatel> node is all 2 spaces.  lots of folks are 4.  i use tabs to I can configure my editor to display at whatever width I want.
[16:33:00] <karamazov> Gotcha - I'm really used to two. All their JS is minified. I should minify mine with google for unhappy reading.
[16:33:10] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[16:33:28] <karamazov> The partial is working perfect, I'm adding home in now.
[16:34:18] <sammych1> quick, what char is \u001?
[16:34:38] <sammych1> it's stuffing up my JSON parsing
[16:35:47] <duch_kazatel> isn't that a control character?
[16:35:52] <duch_kazatel> or escape char?
[16:36:22] <sammych1> can I strip it out with a new line or something?
[16:36:37] <duch_kazatel> you need to clean up whatever is generating the JSON
[16:37:11] <sammych1> it's coming from a webservice, I'll sanitise it before parsing it
[16:37:25] <duch_kazatel> do you have any control over the service?
[16:37:33] <duch_kazatel> because you're not currently generating JSON
[16:37:42] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[16:37:53] <sammych1> another server is giving this to us
[16:38:02] <sammych1> so, I don't know what's building the JSON string
[16:38:08] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to consume this with JS?  if so, get a JSON parsing lib.
[16:38:20] <duch_kazatel> i always forget JSON != javascript.
[16:38:26] <sammych1> yeah, it's json2, crockford or whoever
[16:39:12] <duch_kazatel> LOL "crockford or whoever"
[16:40:14] <sammych1> that's the guy
[16:40:38] <duch_kazatel> just funny to hear somebody refer to him that way.  that'd be like saying "some resig dude or something?"
[16:40:50] <sammych1> "obama or something"
[16:40:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly.
[16:41:19] <sammych1> point taken :)
[16:41:29] <sammych1> this is a JS channel afterall
[16:41:46] <karamazov> duch_kazatel: Better? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/016a16cb271b5063d6e8
[17:01:50] <guzzlefry> So I have a feed which will have <a> elements randomly added. Is there any way to ensure that a certain event handler is bound to each new one?
[17:05:31] <guzzlefry> oh, looks like .on() might be what I want.
[17:07:10] <AcidRain2012> :/ im back
[17:08:52] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry use event delegation.
[17:09:18] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', 'a', function() {});
[17:10:24] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/nzD9kiQ4    <--- any idea on why the script doesnt fire when link is clicked?
[17:10:47] <duch_kazatel> can't bind to something that doesn't yet exist.
[17:10:53] <duch_kazatel> wrap that in a document ready
[17:12:22] <AcidRain2012> duch_kazatel where did you learn this? ur pretty good man
[17:12:47] <guzzlefry> thanks again
[17:12:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm a senior developer at a company that should do over half a billion in business this year ;) i've been around the block.
[17:13:01] <duch_kazatel> also, check out learn.jquery.com
[17:13:07] <guzzlefry> also, good news, Firebug finally shows event listeners on the selected element. :X
[17:13:11] <AcidRain2012> thx for the link
[17:15:42] <AcidRain2012> when doing data-num='1' <-- is single quotes required?
[17:15:49] <duch_kazatel> it's a good idea.
[17:16:00] <duch_kazatel> or double-quotes.
[17:16:29] <AcidRain2012> i usually just end up trapping the ' into the "
[17:16:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:16:46] <AcidRain2012> "''"
[17:16:58] <AcidRain2012> "data-num='1'"
[17:17:05] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[17:17:06] <AcidRain2012> using php to generate all of this code
[17:17:11] <duch_kazatel> ah
[17:18:19] <duch_kazatel> yuck php
[17:22:47] <karamazov> refactoring made a bug come back -_-
[17:33:50] <guzzlefry> Colorbox's overlay image doesn't show up over a flash applet, am I out of luck with that?
[17:36:01] <duch_kazatel> prolly
[17:44:58] <jakesyl> can we use jquery to upload files to a  server securely
[18:07:14] <zizzy> hi, how come the third radio button doesn't show a red outline in firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/pm7AK/3/
[18:09:59] <uskerine> hi, I have a string which is: <input name="reference" value="SER001">
[18:10:06] <uskerine> how can I get the content of value=""
[18:10:06] <uskerine> ?
[18:11:36] <uskerine> Maybe this might be better asked in javascript
[18:16:58] <Fall> uskerine, you might need to assign an id property to that element, you can then use jQuery("#name").val()
[18:17:06] <Fall> name being whatever id you assigned
[18:17:19] <uskerine> It is a string
[18:17:30] <uskerine> but I have been suggested in Javascript to create a dummy element
[18:17:35] <uskerine> and then use .val
[18:17:55] <systemfault> uskerine: $(theHTML).val() ?
[18:18:02] <Fall> what systemfault said.
[18:20:18] <uskerine> so if I just use $('my html string').val(), I will get the value?
[18:20:59] <systemfault> TIAS?
[18:21:08] <uskerine> ?
[18:21:10] <Fall> :D
[18:21:13] <Fall> TIAS rocks.
[18:21:15] <systemfault> Try It And See?
[18:21:32] <zizzy> is this a firefox bug:  the third radio button doesn't show a red outline: http://jsfiddle.net/pm7AK/3/
[18:21:32] <systemfault> It takes a second to open your dev tools console and write a line.
[18:21:36] <uskerine> it works
[18:21:37] <uskerine> thanks
[18:21:51] <systemfault> You’re welcome :)
[18:23:52] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/DF5RwUqtv   <--- this is the last issue i have with the rating system before i start to make it look pretty
[18:26:23] <AcidRain2012> oh shit
[18:26:30] <AcidRain2012> no wait
[18:27:08] <AcidRain2012> that is replacing the link :/
[18:30:37] <AcidRain2012> fixed it!
[18:30:43] <AcidRain2012> but i got a syntax error somewhere :/
[18:34:25] <PantsOfChoco> god debugging galleria is like pulling teeth
[18:36:48] <sammych1> probably better than having teeth pulled, I'd say
[18:43:21] <AcidRain2012> wtf
[18:43:34] <AcidRain2012> the console is logging shit from like... 20 saves ago
[18:43:37] <AcidRain2012> no wonder its not working
[18:48:36] <frank_o> Hi! Does anyone know why CSS3 vendor prefix generators such as https://github.com/imsky/cssFx will only process CSS in the DOM and not externally loaded files?
[18:52:59] <AcidRain2012> $(self).closest('.rating').html(data);   <--- does this not replace the contents of the closest div with class of rating?
[18:58:13] <frank_o> AcidRain2012: maybe closest().find('.ranting')? idk, you'd have to set up a live testcase
[18:58:39] <AcidRain2012> frank_o i got it working. but the issue now is... it only works 1 time
[18:58:47] <AcidRain2012> which makes me think it is replacing the entire div
[18:59:57] <AcidRain2012> idk why. it would be very hard to setup a test case in my example
[19:00:36] <frank_o> AcidRain2012: to me its the only way---http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[19:09:22] <AcidRain2012> well if i append it, it still reloads the first one. which is good i guess. that tells me its still there
[19:13:14] <uskerine> can a <textarea> be made non-editable?
[19:13:20] <uskerine> -same question for <input>
[19:13:23] <AcidRain2012> yes
[19:13:24] <AcidRain2012> yes
[19:13:26] <uskerine> how?
[19:13:27] <uskerine> :)
[19:13:34] <AcidRain2012> i think its <input disabled>
[19:13:39] <AcidRain2012> same for textarea i believe
[19:13:48] <AcidRain2012> <textarea disabled></textarea>
[19:14:10] <uskerine> right
[19:14:11] <uskerine> disabled
[19:14:12] <uskerine> :)
[19:14:15] <uskerine> thanks
[19:14:18] <AcidRain2012> np
[19:42:07] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/B9Ar6uYf   <--- issue is: content of .rating can only be replaced once.  content of .yourRating is not replaced at all
[20:01:28] <AcidRain2012>  $(self).closest('.rating').empty().append(data);    im just not sure where to go with this. no matter how i load the content of the .rating, it wont let me reload it again until the page is refreshed
[20:01:40] <AcidRain2012> are all of these things only meant to be reloaded once?
[20:04:27] <ngharo> AcidRain2012: http://api.jquery.com/on/ read the "delegated vs direct" parts
[20:04:32] <ngharo> you want delegated
[20:05:26] <AcidRain2012> before i even read this. if i have to reconstruct this whole system again im gonna rage quit. lol
[20:05:55] <ngharo> also, use foo.data('bar') instead of foo.attr('data-bar')
[20:06:11] <AcidRain2012> chaning it now
[20:10:10] <ngharo> AcidRain2012: <div class='rating'>
[20:10:10] <ngharo> <span><a href='#' data-id='1' data-rating='5'>5</a></span>
[20:10:13] <ngharo> oops
[20:10:23] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/h6j2j/1/
[20:11:10] <ngharo> notice the container div and the on() call changed
[20:11:32] <AcidRain2012> ngharo, well the thing is, i will have alot of .rating's on the page
[20:11:39] <AcidRain2012> as multiple content at once can be rated
[20:11:50] <ngharo> thats fine
[20:12:01] <ngharo> wrap them all in a container div
[20:12:11] <ngharo> the use a delegated event handler
[20:12:16] <AcidRain2012> ive read the delegation part. i dont see, in my script, what im supposed to bind to the upper div
[20:12:26] <AcidRain2012> or... eh... i have to have a wrapper
[20:12:32] <ngharo> else if you replace the content the event is bound to (like you currently do), the event goes away with it when you blow it away
[20:13:51] <AcidRain2012> in your code
[20:14:04] <AcidRain2012> $('#ratingsContainer').on('click', '.rating a', function () {: shouldnt it be this: $('#ratingsContainer').on('click', '.rating span a', function () {
[20:14:20] <ngharo> either works
[20:14:35] <AcidRain2012> hmmm... i had an issue with that ealier. it shouldnt work. lemme test it
[20:14:45] <ngharo> ".rating a" selects the same thing as ".rating span a" with your markup
[20:15:18] <ngharo> you could do ".rating > span > a" i guess
[20:15:28] <ngharo> > specifies immediate child
[20:16:39] <ngharo> or tag you <a>nchors with a class
[20:16:44] <ngharo> cleanest approach
[20:17:14] <AcidRain2012> i think that would work only if i wanted to replace 1 link. im replacing 5 at once
[20:17:33] <AcidRain2012> well your hax works
[20:17:40] <AcidRain2012> thx for your help man.
[20:17:58] <ngharo> np
[20:20:37] <AcidRain2012> hmmm
[20:22:28] <AcidRain2012> $(self).closest('.yourRating').text("Your Rating: " + rating);  i need to target the div outside (above) .rating
[20:22:39] <AcidRain2012> obviously not self
[20:23:30] <ngharo> how many ".yourRating" exist on your page?
[20:23:37] <ngharo> just one?
[20:23:41] <AcidRain2012> roughly 10/page
[20:23:48] <AcidRain2012> same with .rating
[20:23:53] <ngharo> need to see your full markup to help ya with that
[20:25:39] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/BsF2g8sR
[20:25:44] <AcidRain2012> thats a summary of it.
[20:26:22] <AcidRain2012> but rly... the whole thing is misleading i just realized. yourRating should be totalRating, as its the average of all the ratings.
[20:26:44] <AcidRain2012> so... i need to make another function
[20:27:32] <ngharo> traversing .yourRating is kinda wonky with that markup
[20:27:46] <ngharo> you could .closet('.rating').prev(); i think
[20:28:07] <ngharo> else it would be a lot cleaner if you add another container div around .yourRating, .rating groups
[20:28:28] <adv_> http://advadv.0fees.us/galleria_fiddle2.html , when i use the mousewheel to zoom in an image the canvas stays the same. how can i make it so it shows the area revealed upon a zoom in?
[20:28:31] <ngharo> then you can easily navigate up the the group container then back down to .rating or .yourRating
[20:30:48] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know websockets?
[20:31:52] <ngharo> adv_: zoom seems to be working for me (chrome)
[20:33:51] <AcidRain2012> well its not throwing any errors. but its not working. heh. brb. ill get it
[20:37:09] <adv_> ngharo: it's working, i want the canvas to readjust when i zoom
[20:37:28] <adv_> so zoom in -> larger canvas
[20:39:30] <ngharo> im only on my netbook so can't dig in too deep, but couldnt you adjust the element width (i dont actual see a <canvas> element) with the same ratio of zoom applied
[20:41:02] <adv_> ngharo: i don't know which is the element width.. and yes there's no canvas, it's a way to describe what i want to accomplish
[20:42:08] <ngharo> i can kinda get the effect by modifying the width in css to match my screen resolution
[20:42:27] <adv_> how>
[20:42:28] <adv_> ?
[20:42:29] <ngharo> but the plugin or whatever is resetting it
[20:43:08] <adv_> ngharo: it must be imageCrop option that's resetting it, i think
[20:43:11] <ngharo> inspect the image element on screen and increase the width in your devtools
[20:43:33] <ngharo> then as i zoom, it "grows" horizontally
[20:44:03] <AcidRain2012> ngharo in my markup, why does this not work: $(self).prevUntil('.yourRating').text("Your Rating: " + rating);
[20:44:23] <AcidRain2012> should that not start at .rating and keep going up until it hits .yourRating?
[20:44:29] <adv_> i can maybe do the inverse, imageCrop: true and resize the image somehow..
[20:44:33] <ngharo> prev* searches siblings
[20:44:44] <ngharo> AcidRain2012: i dont think $(self) is a sibling of yourRating
[20:44:48] <adv_> i'm only using it to fit the image to the screen
[20:44:51] <AcidRain2012> so it would have to be contained inside of .rating?
[20:45:13] <AcidRain2012> its a sibling of ratingcontainer. hmmm
[20:45:17] <ngharo> would have to be in the same container as self
[20:45:56] <ngharo> thats why i think you should wrap those groups of elements in another containing div
[20:45:59] <AcidRain2012> good god
[20:46:05] <ngharo> since they're related
[20:46:16] <AcidRain2012> just replaced everything on the page :)
[20:46:45] <adv_> ngharo: http://galleria.io/docs/options/layerFollow/ ,tried this, doesn't work
[21:01:07] <AcidRain2012> ngharo how are you talking about wrapping these a 2nd time?
[21:01:26] <AcidRain2012> seems like no matter what i do the target selector is a form or HTMLDocument
[21:05:25] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/L3PRBF3K  <--- looks like this now
[21:06:03] <AcidRain2012> self = <span><a>self</a></span>
[21:09:14] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/K9eK4/
[21:09:15] <adv_> ngharo: can you help?
[21:09:16] <ngharo> does this help?
[21:09:39] <ngharo> adv_: afraid not :( unfamiliar with that plugin
[21:10:39] <ngharo> AcidRain2012: you got the right idea, checkout the selector i use
[21:10:51] <ngharo> the markup is the same, just class name difference
[21:12:11] <ngharo> closest() to navigate up the group container, find() to navigate back down the yourRating
[21:17:07] <Matt_Ricketts> closest goes up?
[21:17:31] <ngharo> yep
[21:17:38] <chovy> if i return inside a .then callback will it pass that value to next .then callback?
[21:17:44] <Matt_Ricketts> good to know
[21:20:22] <ngharo> chovy: not sure, im a deferred newb but the docs have a chaining example
[21:20:40] <AcidRain2012> <div.yourRating>, length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: <a>, selector: ".yourRating" }
[21:20:52] <AcidRain2012> it appears to be selected
[21:23:59] <_genuser_> anybody here successfully implemented EventSource? (trying in chrome atm)
[21:25:48] <AcidRain2012> wtf. i been doing the same thing for 30min and its working now :/
[21:26:12] <_genuser_> AcidRain2012: lol, the things we find as devs.
[21:26:29] <AcidRain2012> hell i didnt even find anything. idk why its working now
[21:26:33] <AcidRain2012> lol
[21:27:02] <_genuser_> well, I pushed my project to the server for like 10 minutes and thought the changes weren't doing anything. until I realized it quietly start pushing local.
[21:27:11] <AcidRain2012> now i have to rebreak it. to find out how i fixed it
[21:27:32] <_genuser_> lol this is where I tag it, and check it in first.
[21:27:52] <AcidRain2012> lol
[21:28:22] <AcidRain2012> ive done stuff like that. like spent 30min looking for a syntax error only to find out it was a }
[21:28:33] <AcidRain2012> made me rage quit. be surprised how often that happens to me
[21:28:36] <_genuser_> I tag it by date, by version, by evertying logical and then by stuff like "BeforeMakingDaringChange"
[21:28:46] <ngharo> AcidRain2012: sounds like you need a better editor!
[21:29:14] <AcidRain2012> that was back in the day issues. i just couldnt come up with one as good as _genuser_ lol. i use gedit now.
[21:29:25] <AcidRain2012> nicely supports most languages, and highlights { }
[21:29:36] <_genuser_> right now I"m reading all these articles about how great EventSource is. And seeing demo code.
[21:29:43] <ngharo> jshint is helpful for identifying syntaxy errors
[21:29:50] <_genuser_> only to find Chrome just say it's disconnected. doesn't give a reason.
[21:30:09] <ngharo> just glanced at the MDN page, looks p cool
[21:30:15] <_genuser_> I did quite a bit of syntax learning when using notepad. heh, now I just use visual studio even for a simple javascript file.
[21:30:36] <ngharo> i'm dead without vim
[21:30:38] <_genuser_> ngharo: eventsource stuff?
[21:30:43] <ngharo> _genuser_: yeah
[21:30:48] <_genuser_> oh yeah, on linux I pretty much only use vim.
[21:30:59] <_genuser_> unless my gentoo livecd _makes_ us use nano during installs.
[21:31:48] <ngharo> thing i hate most about nano is it not responding when i instinctively :q! inside it
[21:31:53] <ngharo> and it doesn't die :(
[21:32:04] <_genuser_> yeah, I saw eventsource AND websockets and thought I need to figure out how to use each. And then decide which to use for my proj.
[21:32:20] <_genuser_> yeah, <esc>:q! and nano responds with :|
[21:32:32] <ngharo> i've diving into websockets, albit using the EasyRTC library
[21:32:37] <ngharo> webrtc is k-rad
[21:32:53] <AcidRain2012> vim is straight
[21:33:01] <_genuser_> I'm deciding if I want to just write a simple websocket server in c# or use a framework.
[21:33:26] <ngharo> socket.io seems to be a popular choice
[21:33:29] <AcidRain2012> kate is ok. i got a nice theme on gedit. thats why i like it :)
[21:34:08] <_genuser_> socket.io is another thing I want to look at. I could use it for client side. but server side will still ahve to be c#.
[21:36:01] <ngharo> but but nodejs!
[21:36:07] <ngharo> javascript all the things
[21:36:13] <jpnathan> Hi all. i am implement tab script into my page. my source script link is http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation
[21:36:14] <sammych1> inheritance: if I use Object.create(obj), where does the 'constructor' go? or should it be Object.create(buildObjectFunction())?
[21:38:14] <sammych1> hmm, that looks right to me
[21:39:00] <_genuser_> ngharo: yeah, but I'm already writing a c# server to handle a "bunch" of other stuff.
[21:39:04] <jpnathan> Hi all. i am implement tab script into my page. my source script link is http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation. i have one problem here. when i add new tab i can write ajax function. when ajax load after i need to refresh all tabs. i am using load function to load the particular div. but when ajax completed after div loaded successfully. but my tab not working.
[21:39:11] <jpnathan> this is my issue
[21:39:36] <jpnathan> any one handled this type of issue please advice me
[21:39:46] <jpnathan> whats wrong in my code
[21:40:53] <jpnathan> sammych1 please help me
[21:41:00] <_genuser_> ngharo: so I'll write up this c# server serving max 2000 clients and then I need to send input to this server AND response from this one. otherwise, I'd just put node.js and cluster it or something.
[21:41:21] <ngharo> _genuser_: sounds legit
[21:42:02] <_genuser_> ngharo: I remember doing a pretty exhaustive asynchronous messaging framework back in teh day. Right around the time comet was picking up too.
[21:42:47] <_genuser_> ngharo: but I didn't have the patience to complete it. I really just wanted to proof it out on IE,FF,chrome,safari,konqueror and when it performed same on all using different fallbacks, my curiosity was over.
[21:42:51] <_genuser_> lol.
[21:45:00] <jpnathan> any one please help me :::::::  Hi all. i am implement tab script into my page. my source script link is http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation. i have one problem here. when i add new tab i can write ajax function. when ajax load after i need to refresh all tabs. i am using load function to load the particular div. but when ajax completed after div loaded successfully. but my tab not working.
[21:46:16] <_genuser_> IE, oh IE. why do you leave off support for stuff.
[21:46:30] <_genuser_> why change just the UI in each version. add some frigging stuff.
[21:47:35] <jpnathan> help me <_genuser_>
[21:53:16] <_genuser_> what is the problem?
[21:53:42] <_genuser_> click add tab, type in info and it add the tab.

[22:16:36] <AcidRain2012> for what ever reason i didnt implement oop before. i have failed
[22:16:52] <AcidRain2012> i just did it for the beats. very nice i can get any bit of data in 1 line
[22:17:06] <FarLight> the beats?
[22:17:47] <AcidRain2012> ye im making lil site for someone. a beat producer.
[22:18:03] <AcidRain2012> i wasnt expecting him to change his mind about every single thing on the site.
[22:18:20] <AcidRain2012> oop helps me to quickly battle against his indecisivness
[22:18:27] <sammych1> I'm not really sure I get inheritance here. Am I doing it wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/BvRtr/1/
[22:18:35] <FarLight> Tell him to stop changing his mind or you'll "beat" him up.
[22:18:49] <sammych1> if it's freelance, just ask for more money
[22:18:51] <AcidRain2012> lol
[22:18:54] <sammych1> MONEY
[22:19:04] <AcidRain2012> $$$ cha ching. band man
[22:19:30] <AcidRain2012> http://lex2kbeats.com/  <--- look at the ugly "rap beats for sale" that sticks out on the page more than anything
[22:19:55] <sammych1> my favourite part about that site is how long it's taking to load
[22:19:56] <AcidRain2012> everything that graphically looks ugly was his doings
[22:20:13] <AcidRain2012> loads instantly for me :)
[22:20:14] <sammych1> oh god. Word Art.
[22:20:51] <FarLight> You should raise the contrast between the bg and the navigation link's font color
[22:21:20] <AcidRain2012> man its how he wants it. trust me. every suggestion your about to make i have alrdy done
[22:21:30] <sammych1> anyone for JS Inheritance? http://jsfiddle.net/BvRtr/1/
[22:21:47] <sammych1> I know you wanna help me
[22:22:00] <AcidRain2012> i battled the nav links, and the 'rap beats for sale', and several other things. even registered fake users and complained. lmao
[22:22:07] <FarLight> What do you want to know sammych1 ?
[22:22:18] <sammych1> I want to know if the pattern is right
[22:22:37] <AcidRain2012> and i wont lie. i used everyones nick here in a fake irc log doing 'lulz' at both of those.
[22:22:57] <AcidRain2012> i figured if he has 700 people who had random bad things to say about it he would change his mind. not the case
[22:23:20] <sammych1> just ask the friendly peeps at 4chan
[22:23:42] <sammych1> anons*
[22:33:13] <systemfault> sammych1: Yup, crockford-style inheritance
[22:33:50] <FarLight> I hate crockford
[22:34:06] <systemfault> I like him even if I don’t follow a lot of his “rules"
[22:34:18] <FarLight> I like his rules, but I don't like him as a person
[22:34:53] <systemfault> I still use the ++ operator :P
[22:35:00] <FarLight> lol
[22:37:09] <FarLight> systemfault, http://apebox.org/wordpress/rants/456/
[22:37:52] <_genuser_> eh, SSE as so bleh.
[22:37:58] <systemfault> FarLight: That’s BS
[22:38:03] <_genuser_> and thank you IE for not supporting those. it would have been useful if you did.
[22:38:19] <systemfault> (Even though I agree that the JSON2.js license is retarded)
[22:38:51] <FarLight> systemfault bs in what way
[22:40:07] <systemfault> FarLight: License crap is BS to me.
[22:40:19] <sammych1> systemfault: thanks.
[22:40:28] <sammych1> it's time to build out a pretty fat app
[22:41:34] <systemfault> FarLight: I prefer to judge software for its technical merits.
[22:42:00] <FarLight> systemfault: but the best software is useless if the license restricts you from using it
[22:43:12] <systemfault> If you want a license that restricts you, look at the GPL
[22:44:09] <systemfault> FarLight: What do you suggest? XML?
[22:44:35] <FarLight> In the case of crockfords thing, it was only the implementation that was under that license
[22:45:17] <FarLight> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=63520
[22:45:39] <FarLight> Some dude called "remi" rewrote it
[22:46:08] <systemfault> Anyway, I thought that only ECMA-404 mattered.
[22:46:10] <_genuser_> man I crashed my IIS real hard.
[22:46:27] <systemfault> _genuser_: Then don’t use IIS… and don’t use Windows.
[22:46:43] <_genuser_> systemfault: heh, I have crashed apache much worse lot more times.
[22:46:53] <systemfault> apache sucks.
[22:46:56] <_genuser_> but I still use apache for where it's better suited.
[22:47:05] <systemfault> Only noob web devs use it :/
[22:47:13] <systemfault> Because it’s soooo easy to install.
[22:47:38] <FarLight> I don't even know what IIS is :(
[22:47:39] <flam_> i use it because our production servers run it (mostly)
[22:47:42] <_genuser_> well, it's the first time I've seen IIS crash. some I wrote messed it up.
[22:47:59] <flam_> it's better to develop locally with the same server my shit will be deployed on
[22:48:08] <FarLight> is it analogous to apache?
[22:48:23] <_genuser_> I use IIS because my customer uses it.
[22:48:32] <systemfault> If I have to run PHP code, I’ll use nginx :P
[22:48:54] <systemfault> _genuser_: So you’re from the MS world? :P Using C#?
[22:48:54] <_genuser_> customer pays the bills, so I'm not going to sit there and say, "oh IIS is for n00bs. apache is for n00bs. Look at me with my node.js behing nginx/etc".
[22:49:04] <_genuser_> systemfault: yep man, it pays the bills. :)
[22:49:20] <systemfault> Love C#… don’t like the MS lock-in :/
[22:49:23] <_genuser_> systemfault: did c/c++ in college but got hired out as VB dev with no real vb experience.
[22:49:39] <VectorX> hi, i need to insert <li> into a <ul> when a button is clicked, i am using .append() but i want the <ul> to clear out and new conttent to be appended, whats the best efficient way to do this
[22:49:51] <VectorX> ie without using up mem etc
[22:49:58] <systemfault> _genuser_: I jerked off with C++ for years as a hobby, ended up doing JS and PHP for web shops.
[22:50:19] <FarLight> VectorX: You want all the li's in the ul to be removed and a new one added?
[22:50:24] <_genuser_> systemfault: yeah c# is pretty ok to use. I'm enjoying learning node.js stuff and php for fun.
[22:50:27] <VectorX> yes
[22:50:31] <VectorX> FarLight yes
[22:50:37] <FarLight> you can do something like .empty().append();
[22:50:42] <sammych1> I want to use Swift instead of JS
[22:50:55] <sammych1> Swift as a Browser language.
[22:50:57] <_genuser_> systemfault: problem with ASP.NET is, it's just too much work for nothing. Even tho, php is slow, it ends up being faster to use it than setting up MVC 2/3/4 project in visual stufio.
[22:51:09] <_genuser_> systemfault: but I use asp.net for customer sh|t. heh.
[22:52:08] <flam_> asp.net webforms is horrible:p
[22:52:20] <flam_> the mvc stuff seems ok but i haven't used it
[22:52:21] <VectorX> FarLight thanks thats good
[22:52:27] <systemfault> _genuser_: asp.net apps using C# end up being more reliable applications though....
[22:52:33] <systemfault> _genuser_: quality matters..
[22:52:43] <FarLight> VectorX: great
[22:52:49] <_genuser_> flam_: asp.net page-view-controller stuff is just nuts. It makes sense that they did it that way but it really sucks.
[22:52:51] <jotterbot1234> i need to target and update a row in a jquery template engine table, and force a "reflow" of the table, anyone used jquery file upload blueimp plugin?
[22:53:52] <_genuser_> systemfault: for customer I use asp.net. they want an 800 number to dial if crap hits the fan. And it's realiable but theme'ing and maintenance of a regular website is horrible.
[22:53:59] <_genuser_> it's better suited for web apps.
[22:54:21] <systemfault> _genuser_: templating is horrible or what?
[22:54:28] <_genuser_> flam_: the mvc stuff is all hype. Every year they have mvc 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. it's just crap.
[22:54:47] <systemfault> I’ve only heard good things about MVC 3/4
[22:55:27] <_genuser_> systemfault: you can set up master pages and use them for templating/theme'ing. But that's just for your app. Unless you want to setup a corporate wide master page and then force everyone to use it in a visual studio project just to be able to make even static html pages.
[22:56:07] <_genuser_> systemfault: well mvc itself isn't the problem. it's that companies feel the need to repackage it each year so you'd buy it. And engineers go all nuts thinking they're really learnt the new stuff.
[22:59:39] <sammych1> clearly I assumed wrong when I thought Object.create(obj) cloned obj
[23:01:19] <_genuser_> alright, I've demo'd EventSource stuff. time to demo WebSocket stuff and see which performs better.
[23:01:41] <systemfault> sammych1: It doesn’t clone.
[23:01:58] <systemfault> sammych1: It creates an object using the passed object as its prototype
[23:02:10] <sammych1> I also messed up something bad
[23:02:20] <sammych1> also, that I just got
[23:02:26] <systemfault> prototypal inheritance is how JS works.
[23:06:15] <sammych1> so, what's the proper way of cloning an object including getting all it's inherited properties and 'methods'?
[23:08:13] <Cork> sammych1: (haven't seen the beginning of this conversation) you could loop it with a for in
[23:08:15] <systemfault> sammych1: No built-in way.
[23:08:28] <systemfault> sammych1: If you use jQuery, you can use $.extends
[23:08:45] <sammych1> and that works with inherited properties?
[23:12:02] <Cork> $.extend just like $.each only loops the objects own properties
[23:12:20] <sammych1> that's why I asked
[23:12:32] <Cork> for in don't though
[23:12:34] <sammych1> I've got an idea anyway, see if it works
[23:13:34] <Cork> var new_object = {}; for(key in old_object) { new_object[key] = old_object[key]; }
[23:13:41] <Cork> that doesn't do a deep copy though
[23:14:12] <sammych1> yeah, that's what I'm doing :D
[23:14:56] <sammych1> for (var key in this) { ... {
[23:14:58] <sammych1> oop
[23:20:12] <sammych1> herm, is __proto__ a bad idea?
[23:20:28] <Cork> define bad
[23:20:42] <sammych1> can I use it call 'super' methods?
[23:21:14] <sammych1> should I
[23:22:04] <Cork> sammych1: this should answer that question :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto
[23:23:02] <sammych1> I've got a cloneObject method on the Superclass that I want to call
[23:23:05] <Cork> sammych1: and i haven't really ever used __proto__ so can't really answer that question
[23:23:41] <sammych1> when I redefine it on the subclass, I want the subclass to call it's 'super' method to get that object first
[23:23:55] <sammych1> fairly standard fare
[23:24:07] <sammych1> and thanks for the link
[23:24:33] <Cork> sammych1: you're trying to fit a java/c++ construction into the javascript mo
[23:24:40] <Cork> *javascript model
[23:24:52] <Cork> javascript (pre es6) doesn't really support this
[23:24:56] <flam_> it's possible i don't know how reasonable:p
[23:25:29] <Cork> sammych1: basically you're trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole
[23:25:33] <Cork> :)
[23:25:36] <sammych1> oh come on
[23:25:42] <sammych1> there has to be a better way
[23:25:53] <Cork> sammych1: es5 doesn't have classes
[23:26:06] <Cork> so the type of intereting your talking about doesn't exist
[23:26:19] <Cork> *inheriting
[23:26:22] <sammych1> well, calling __proto.cloneObject behaves how I want it to
[23:26:37] <Cork> except it is depricated, and slow
[23:27:01] <sammych1> sure
[23:27:14] <sammych1> so, should I just skip the whole inheritance thing
[23:27:32] <Cork> sammych1: the inhereting i talked about is prototype
[23:27:43] <sammych1> the base class is really only about 25 lines, but it's really a refactoring effort if I need to alter it
[23:27:44] <Cork> and that is what js supports (for now)
[23:28:05] <Cork> es6 do define class
[23:28:10] <Cork> es5 doesn't have it at all
[23:28:14] <sammych1> I'm targeting IE11
[23:28:25] <Cork> ppl love to define constructors as "classes" but they arn't
[23:28:44] <sammych1> I don't think I've ever used the word 'class' today ;)
[23:29:01] * Cork points at the line one min ago
[23:29:27] <sammych1> I should just be quiet now
[23:29:31] <Cork> :)
[23:29:50] <sammych1> the only issue I have is trying to clone an object
[23:29:54] <systemfault> Even in ES6, class is just syntaxic sugar on top of prototypes.
[23:30:04] <sammych1> everything else redefines the method without need for calling the preexisting method
[23:30:23] <Cork> systemfault: sure, but you DO have super
[23:30:43] <Cork> and extends
[23:30:55] <sammych1> so, I'm just looking for a clean way to return a brand new object
[23:31:00] <systemfault> OMG! :/ I never needed them in JS
[23:31:11] <systemfault> sammych1: Why don’t you write us an example, perhaps we could help.
[23:31:14] <sammych1> what if I just never overload method names
[23:31:16] <Cork> systemfault: there is A LOT of things i've never needed in es6 ^^'
[23:32:04] <systemfault> Cork: Some of them are sooo nice, like generators and the arrow functions
[23:32:12] <Cork> systemfault: true
[23:32:18] <Cork> then you have things like String.raw
[23:32:26] <Cork> and the `` syntax...
[23:33:38] <flam_> what are arrow functions?
[23:34:07] <systemfault> flam_: A shortcut to create functions that “inherits” the this of its outer function
[23:34:37] <systemfault> [1,2,3,4].map(x => x * 2); instead of [1,2,3,4].map(function(x) { return x * 2; });
[23:36:08] <Cork> it also supports [1,2,3,4].map(x => { let z = x * 2; z +5 });
[23:36:20] <sammych1> that looks Swifty
[23:36:33] <Cork> swifty?
[23:36:38] <Cork> you mean the apple language?
[23:37:49] <sammych1> yeah
[23:38:01] <sammych1> Swift-y
[23:38:03] <FarLight> When can we reasonably use the stuff in ECMA6?
[23:38:37] <_rgn> i want to have those arrow functions so bad
[23:38:47] <FarLight> yeah
[23:38:54] <_rgn> FarLight: you can use it already with a transpiler
[23:39:23] <systemfault> FarLight: Probably in a year… for firefox and chrome...
[23:39:34] <flam_> they are just a more succinct version of lambdas + their context is the context of the enclosing function?
[23:39:36] <systemfault> FarLight: The problem is going to be IE and Safari… as usual
[23:39:38] <flam_> or something like that:p
[23:39:46] <systemfault> flam_: Yup
[23:39:48] <Cork> FarLight: es6 went stable a few months ago
[23:39:59] <Cork> before it was called ecmascript next
[23:40:05] <FarLight> It's weird how the specs are being written for widespread use 5-10 years in the future
[23:41:05] <Cork> FarLight: 5-10 was cause of ie's slow uptake
[23:41:06] <tw2113> isn't it usually the browsers that experiment who actually shape how the specs go?
[23:41:13] <Cork> now days ie moves much faster
[23:41:26] <Cork> so i think ie would support this in say ie13 or ie14
[23:41:42] <Cork> after that it depends on how long a back tail you want to support
[23:41:48] <tw2113> the browsers come before the spec, not the other way around, at least in early drafts
[23:42:00] <Cork> tw2113: no not in es
[23:42:05] <Cork> html and css works that way
[23:42:10] <FarLight> tw2113: Ecma International has the final say I think
[23:42:18] <mooru> how can i append or prepend html to the val() of a submit button
[23:42:29] <Cork> mooru: you can't
[23:42:41] <tw2113> gotcha, ES leads in their style of standard, html/css is flipped
[23:42:44] <Cork> if the submit button is <input type="submit"> you can't have html in it
[23:42:50] <Cork> mooru:  replace it with <button>
[23:42:56] <Cork> then you just do .html()
[23:43:08] <Cork> tw2113: yup
[23:43:25] <Cork> tw2113: cause es works like most other languages
[23:43:29] <mooru> Cork: i am trying to add a fontawesome icon to the button
[23:43:33] <Cork> where you propose a syntax to fix a problem
[23:43:47] <Cork> while html/css works by implementors leat
[23:43:49] <Cork> *lead
[23:44:01] <Cork> mooru: my comment still stand
[23:44:10] <Cork> you can't do it on a <input type=""> field
[23:44:20] <Cork> at least not through append/html
[23:44:26] <Cork> you could try through css
[23:44:43] <Cork> though getting <input type="submit"> css to work cross browser is...
[23:44:47] <Cork> worse then hell
[23:44:51] <mooru> Cork: its input type alright. maybe i'll just leave it at that
[23:45:04] <mooru> input type sbmit i mean
[23:45:21] <Cork> mooru: why not just do <input type="submit" value="123"> => <button>123</button> ?
[23:45:28] <Cork> it has the same function
[23:45:35] <Cork> just much more flexible
[23:45:41] <mooru> ok
[23:45:48] <sammych1> button type is submit
[23:45:54] <Cork> by default ya
[23:46:06] <Cork> you CAN do <button type="button"></button>
[23:46:15] <sammych1> if you're really so inclined
[23:46:29] <Cork> well if you want to use <button> in a form
[23:46:33] <Cork> and not have it submit the form
[23:46:35] <Cork> you have to
[23:47:26] <sammych1> I spoke too soon, yeah
[23:48:05] <sammych1> I solved my issue...If I want to call the 'super' method, I don't overload it
[23:48:12] <sammych1> genius!
[23:48:46] <sammych1> instead of a generic method name, it's clone<Type>
[23:49:01] <sammych1> then loop through the properties with hasOwnProp
[23:52:04] <VectorX> i got a jQuery(".video_result").click(function () {  and i am appending with .append '<a class="video_result" href="#" data-vid="'+entry.id+ '">' +   but the a tag isnt getting the function, why is that ?
[23:52:42] <Cork> VectorX: cause you add the event handler to the elements matching the selector
[23:52:49] <Cork> as of when you run the selector
[23:52:59] <Cork> if you want it to match the class dynamically
[23:53:07] <Cork> attach the event handler to a parent
[23:53:26] <Cork> $('.video_result-parent').on('click', '.video_result', func)
[23:53:37] <VectorX> ok
[23:54:02] <Cork> VectorX: make sure the parent is static though
[23:54:09] <Cork> else you will get the same problem again
[23:54:11] <VectorX> it is
[23:54:15] <VectorX> im appending to it
[23:57:45] <VectorX> Cork good to go
[23:59:05] <Bogdaniel> using jquery how can i change data from a data attribute i'm trying to set with jquery the data-href from facebook share button
