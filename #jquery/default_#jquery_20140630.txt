[00:00:06] <rolife> MaxCDN support says, write to jQuery support.. ) Cork, ths 4 this alternative link.
[00:02:06] <Macaveli> Morning all :)
[00:29:08] <CaffeinatedSky> Is it possible to do a for loop for setting value's of an input? The code I have isn't working with a for loop but is without the for loop. http://jsbin.com/yoricoqo/1/edit
[00:29:59] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: http://jsbin.com/yoricoqo/2/edit
[00:30:11] <Cork> also you want >= not >
[00:31:47] <CaffeinatedSky> Crap, I'm doing PHP in JQuery. I'm an idiot.
[00:31:49] <CaffeinatedSky> Thanks Cork!
[00:31:53] <Cork> np
[00:35:36] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: though you could simplify the code quite a bit if you gave the elements a class
[00:36:18] <CaffeinatedSky> Well the real problem is that there's 40 different callsigns. That are grouped into 4. (10 groups of 4)
[00:36:33] <CaffeinatedSky> If one changes in the group, all 4 should change.
[00:36:57] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: like so? http://jsbin.com/yoricoqo/2/edit
[00:37:47] <Cork> oppsor even better http://jsbin.com/yoricoqo/2/edit
[00:37:52] <CaffeinatedSky> Hmm, excuse my ignorance, but is there a way to do that while using another class?
[00:37:56] <Cork> *or even
[00:38:02] <CaffeinatedSky> For example: class="input-xsmall focused" is my current class since I'm using bootstrap
[00:38:12] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: sure
[00:38:26] <Cork> $(".input-xsmall")
[00:38:43] <CaffeinatedSky> Well, I have quite a bit of input-xsmall's :P
[00:38:54] <CaffeinatedSky> Some that have nothing to do with the "callsign"
[00:39:03] <CaffeinatedSky> Thus why I was going with id's :s
[00:39:19] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: just give them an additional class
[00:39:28] <Cork> you can have as many as you want on any elements
[00:39:44] <Cork> CaffeinatedSky: as you want to work with a group you shouldn't use id
[00:40:04] <CaffeinatedSky> For sure, your way is definitely preferable.
[00:40:40] <CaffeinatedSky> class="input-xsmall focused group1" or would I call another class="group1" along side the other one?
[00:40:53] <Cork> nope the first one is correct
[00:41:00] <Cork> class="" is a space separated list
[00:41:11] <CaffeinatedSky> Today I learned =D
[00:41:34] <CaffeinatedSky> I'm going to go try this out. Thank you very much Cork. You saved me alot of lines of code and time
[00:41:44] <Cork> good luck
[00:44:00] <mstefanko> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/441412/is-there-a-link-to-the-latest-jquery-library-on-google-apis the latest link is the most popular answer hehe
[00:44:04] <mstefanko> well who can fix it ?
[00:44:32] <Cork> mstefanko: list i said, https://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js
[00:47:28] <mstefanko> Cork thank you i know how to replace the link. but who can fix the broken one? this should affect a good amount of pages out of nowhere
[00:47:51] <Cork> mstefanko: like i've said; i've notified the ops
[00:47:54] <Cork> can't really do much more
[00:50:13] <CaffeinatedSky> Cork, This is what I came up with and it works beautifully. http://jsbin.com/yoricoqo/4/edit?js
[00:50:30] <CaffeinatedSky> You took what would have been over 200 lines of code and reduced it to 9. Thank you again.
[00:52:26] <Cork> mstefanko: got a replay
[00:52:37] <Cork> mstefanko: the -latest has NEVER been supported for production
[00:53:07] <Cork> mstefanko: so ya, it is removed cause it wasn't correct anymore
[00:53:15] <mstefanko> should break a ton of pages
[00:53:29] <Cork> mstefanko: ton of pages using a none supported link ya
[00:53:43] <Cork> mstefanko: the page explicitly stated NOT to use it in production
[00:55:35] <mstefanko> i understand what you're saying, but if you simply google for 'jquery latest' you won't get such warnings anywhere. and a stackoverflow reply suggesting it, started 2009 and latest updated in february 2014 with over 700 upvotes will also add to the damage
[00:55:43] <mstefanko> so removing it is not going to help anyone
[00:55:53] <Cork> mstefanko: then check the cdn instead http://code.jquery.com/jquery/
[00:56:07] <Cork> and http://code.jquery.com/
[00:56:10] <mstefanko> Cork as already stated
[00:56:14] <mstefanko> i do know where to find other versions
[00:56:40] <Cork> mstefanko: well it is the effect of taking random facts from random pages as correct
[00:57:03] <Cork> sadly SO is known for all its wrong facts about jquery
[00:59:16] <mstefanko> it's great to talk about principles and the correct implementation, however SO is one of the most popular and trusted sources for such details and debating how people answer there on other jquery related topics - won't help anyone. i do understand that using jquery.latest was always a risk, if you had libraries with depreciated functions; but not a risk as in that it would be removed from one
[00:59:16] <mstefanko> day to the other and break a ton of pages with no warning
[01:00:12] <Cork> mstefanko: for reference https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/10
[01:01:58] <mstefanko> hmm
[01:02:08] <mstefanko> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/tree/master/cdn includes it, so it's a bad sync to the cdn?
[01:03:23] <Cork> wouldn't know
[01:05:15] <Cork> mstefanko: anyway the core of the changes is that for production you want a fixed version
[01:05:22] <Cork> and a controlled update to a new version
[01:05:33] <mstefanko> that's ok, i'm aware of the risks
[01:05:59] <naprac> can i prevent js var from erasing after a php load self?
[01:06:27] <Cork> naprac: the entire page is thrown away if you reload the page
[01:06:37] <Cork> so no js is unloaded with the rest of the page
[01:06:53] <naprac> so i need to save the vars into file?
[01:07:47] <naprac> or cookie?
[01:09:37] <Cork> naprac: either you need to use ajax to fetch the new content instead of reloading the page
[01:09:59] <Cork> or you need to store the data you want to keep cross page loads with one of the different client side storage solutions
[01:10:03] <Cork> like sessionStore or similar
[01:12:10] <naprac> what are the different client side storage solutions, preferable the ones that works on all broswers, at least major ones
[01:12:41] <Cork> ?mdn sessionStore
[01:12:43] <b-ot> Cork: nsISessionStore - Mozilla | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsISessionStore
[01:12:47] <Cork> uh
[01:13:02] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Session_store_API
[01:13:17] <Cork> ugg that is trusted code
[01:13:36] <Cork> ... where have they tucked away the public api...
[01:13:51] <Cork> ah
[01:13:53] <Cork> there
[01:13:59] <Cork> naprac: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage
[01:15:03] <naprac> that sounds somekind of hack ;)
[01:15:16] <Cork> naprac: ya, what you want is most likely to use ajax
[01:15:36] <naprac> so i guess ajax store and restore is the best bet or cookie?
[01:15:48] <Cork> no
[01:15:54] <Cork> ajax doesn't unload the page
[01:16:13] <Cork> it sends a request to the server and the server responds with data the js then uses to update the page
[01:16:16] <Cork> no unload needed
[01:16:59] <naprac> yes, but i need to save the vars somewhere since php calls self
[01:17:11] <Cork> naprac: that is the point
[01:17:15] <Cork> don't reload the page from php
[01:17:24] <naprac> i have to
[01:17:26] <Cork> have js request the data from the server instead
[01:17:27] <Cork> why?
[01:18:47] <naprac> hmm probably cause i design it badly ;)
[01:19:30] <naprac> it's just pagenumbering and when user clicks pagenunber php fetces new set
[01:19:46] <Cork> no not php
[01:19:54] <Cork> sounds like you have full page navigations
[01:20:07] <Cork> and you do something like /index.php?=page=5
[01:20:11] <Cork> opps
[01:20:17] <Cork> */index.php?page=5
[01:20:35] <naprac> yes //<a href="var?=$i> etc
[01:20:36] <Cork> and if you do, then you could just send the data in the url
[01:20:50] <Cork> as longs as it isn't too much
[01:21:33] <naprac> i was thinking of that but i couldn't figure out how to stre js var into url
[01:21:43] <naprac> store
[01:22:06] <Cork> naprac: what type of data is it you need from js?
[01:22:18] <naprac> it's just id numbers
[01:22:29] <Cork> id from what?
[01:22:30] <naprac> integers
[01:22:56] <Cork> of what >_<
[01:23:03] <naprac> yes //<a id="$i> etc
[01:23:03] <Cork> use id? table id? what?
[01:23:14] <Cork> ok so the id of the link
[01:23:17] <Cork> why do you need that?
[01:23:40] <naprac> wait a minute i need to think this
[01:26:00] <naprac> pagenav is just to fetch new set of data the js var gets ut's value depended user choices on page i need to keep this js var data between page changes
[01:26:15] <naprac> i think that sums it up
[01:27:31] <naprac> i can do the pagenav with js but i mafe this pafenav in php because if there is alot of data i think it's better that way
[01:29:26] <Cork> naprac: ok, so you send the request to the server and the server sends a full page back
[01:29:42] <naprac> yes
[01:29:46] <Cork> naprac: what prevents the server from just setting a class or similar on the link that is the "current"?
[01:29:57] <Cork> i don't see why js needs to be involved in this at all
[01:31:32] <naprac> jq handles events when user makes choices
[01:31:49] <naprac> looks nicer when there are effects etc
[01:32:19] <naprac> and it collect the id numbers of user choices
[01:32:21] <Cork> naprac: you won't get that as the animations will be stopped as the page is unloaded
[01:32:30] <nicolas_FR> hi there, I've a problem with IE11 and jQuery 1.8.2 (tried too with 1.11.1) + validation plugin (v1.11.1) : when validating a file form, I've a message saying the size method is not available on a null object. But this works with FF30, chrome, IE8+ etc. Only IE11 seems to crash on it. Any known issue with validation and IE11 ?
[01:32:41] <Cork> if you want that kind of effect, you NEED to move over to using ajax
[01:33:41] <naprac> yes i think i need to store the ids in ajax call and then when user changes page ajax call to get them back
[01:34:27] <naprac> just seems so silly to store data just because page changes
[01:34:29] <Cork> naprac: no ajax isn't storing anything
[01:34:40] <Cork> ajax is a way to request data from the server
[01:34:47] <Cork> it doesn't store anything
[01:34:51] <naprac> ajax call to store.php etc
[01:35:11] <Cork> naprac: uh...
[01:35:40] <Cork> why not just do $.ajax('/page.php?page=<number').done(update_page_listing); ?
[01:36:03] <Cork> just fetch the new content from the server with ajax
[01:36:08] <Cork> and replace the section in the page
[01:36:14] <Cork> and you won't need to store anything
[01:37:00] <naprac> yes ic, i need to rethink this one possibility is the url replace if i can figure out who to do that
[01:37:14] <naprac> who/how
[01:41:53] <naprac> btw how long can an url be?
[01:42:07] <Cork> naprac: depends on the browser
[01:42:22] <naprac> whats a safe length?
[01:42:47] <Cork> i think ie has the shortest limit and it is 2048
[01:43:00] <naprac> 2048 characters?
[01:43:02] <Cork> ya
[01:44:55] <naprac> hmm with 4 difit ids it's over 500 ids i think thats enough
[01:45:05] <naprac> difit/digits
[01:45:20] <Cork> uh what?
[01:45:38] <Cork> why do you need to send 500 ids in the url?!?
[01:46:09] <Cork> it sounds like you are seriously over working something
[01:47:23] <naprac> well semiseriously, it worked well until i decided to add this php pagenumbering ;)
[01:47:59] <Cork> well you arn't giving me enough data to see why you need to do this
[01:48:22] <Cork> but it sounds like you are using a nuke to kill a mosquito
[01:51:36] <naprac> probably need to rethink this, i just want it to work fast and was thinking that fetching 500 records in one load could slow it down
[01:52:01] <Cork> naprac: sure but i don't see why this matters
[01:52:10] <Cork> when the page loads you load page 1
[01:52:19] <Cork> when they click to jump to the next pagination
[01:52:25] <Cork> you send an ajax call to the server for page 2
[01:52:35] <Cork> the content is just the list section
[01:52:40] <Cork> and you replace it in the current page
[01:52:48] <Cork> as the page isn'
[01:52:53] <Cork> *'t reloaded
[01:53:01] <Cork> js isn't unloaded and nothing is lost
[01:53:47] <naprac> yes, thats what i want, i need to rethink the design
[01:55:50] <naprac> well thanks for the advice
[02:02:15] <Abishek_> could someone advice on how to have a slider similar to http://teespring.com/designs/8x3b5n/edit#!/1gr/2/pricing. I spoke to coldhead about this, but still cant seem to figure out how to do it. If you notice the slider, the steps are not in a sequence. For Example, it start from 10 => 20, then it changes the sequence. And at the end if you go more than 400, it still increases by 1 but goes upto 1000
[02:19:42] <murosai> if i have cloned a table with clonedTable = $("#call-history-table").clone(); then how can i later "paste" this table?
[02:20:04] <Cork> murosai: just .append or .html()
[02:25:37] <murosai> Cork: but doesn't clone() clone the entire table including <table>?
[02:25:43] <Cork> yes
[02:25:57] <Cork> so?
[02:26:32] <murosai> so $("#table").append(clonedTable) would result in something like <table><table>
[02:27:18] <Cork> ah, you want to clone the rows not the table?
[02:27:47] <Cork> ("#call-history-table tbody tr").clone()
[02:28:34] <murosai> hm yeah basically, or alternatively clone the entire table and replace the entire table
[02:29:06] <murosai> i can do the row thing but im just wondering how the latter is possible
[02:42:27] <abishek> Cork, could you advice on how to have a slider similar to http://teespring.com/designs/8x3b5n/edit#!/1gr/2/pricing. I cant seem to figure out how to do it using the Jquery Slider API. If you notice the slider, the steps are not in a sequence. For Example, it start from 10 => 20, then it changes the sequence. And at the end if you go more than 400, it still increases by 1 but goes upto 1000. Have been trying for a very long time to get this working
[04:13:39] <Pritesh> heloo
[04:13:49] <Pritesh> can any one help
[04:14:21] <Pritesh> me i am not getting the example of muliple dragable items
[04:14:44] <Pritesh> on http://jqueryui.com/
[04:33:34] <intellilogic> Trying to convert this the jQ:  document.getElementById('iconselect').addEventListener('changed', function(){ $('#text').val(iconSelect.getSelectedValue()); });
[04:34:37] <Cork> intellilogic: $('#iconselect').on('change', function(){ $('#text').val(iconSelect.getSelectedValue()); });
[04:34:52] <Cork> intellilogic: changed isn't an event
[04:35:11] <Cork> unless someone if firing a fake event that is
[04:35:26] <intellilogic> Cork, must be...
[04:35:29] <intellilogic> it works
[04:35:39] <intellilogic> I looked through lib, didn't see code for it :-/
[04:35:42] <intellilogic> I must need to look more
[04:36:10] <intellilogic> Derp, found it this time:  _View.iconSelectElement.dispatchEvent(new Event('changed'));
[04:36:20] <intellilogic> If I just change that to 'change'...?
[04:36:41] <Cork> intellilogic: na, then it is intentional
[04:36:52] <Cork> so $('#iconselect').on('changed', function(){ $('#text').val(iconSelect.getSelectedValue()); }); should work
[04:37:03] <intellilogic> Ut doesn't :(
[04:37:44] <intellilogic> FML, type :(
[04:39:42] <intellilogic> Cork: Ok, that's resolved and works, now I have a problem in the next evolution
[04:39:57] <intellilogic> $(document).on('changed', '#iconselect', function(){ $('#test').val(iconSelect.getSelectedValue()); });
[04:40:10] <intellilogic> no document.changed :-/
[04:40:28] <intellilogic> I need this because this bit is loaded in via ajax
[04:40:36] <intellilogic> I guess I have to write the other bit
[04:40:40] <Cork> intellilogic: delegated events only works if the event bubbles
[04:40:59] <Cork> and i guess _View.iconSelectElement.dispatchEvent(new Event('changed')); doesn't
[04:41:51] <intellilogic> So I have to make it bubble, yea?
[04:42:14] <Cork> intellilogic: or you have to bind it statically ya
[05:31:35] <VectorX> hi, what is wrong with this array, im getting -1 for indexOf http://jsfiddle.net/LkcgF/
[05:32:00] <tiblock> Hi. Is this correct and valid solution to get additional data from <select>? http://jsfiddle.net/NhKRw/
[05:32:34] <tiblock> VectorX, you have array with array[0] = object
[05:32:52] <tiblock> VectorX, you need data[0]['Queensland']
[05:33:45] <VectorX> how can i get the index of that, i can reformat the array
[05:34:15] <tiblock> VectorX, objects dont have number indexses, there is on "indexOf"
[05:34:23] <tiblock> *is no
[05:34:35] <VectorX> im getting a value from elsewhere and i need to get the second param that matches that value
[05:35:18] <tiblock> VectorX, for your array is data[0]['Queensland']
[05:35:25] <sil3nti> Hello guys, is this the right way to hide the if body = "" ? http://jsfiddle.net/RzaGL/
[05:35:58] <tiblock> VectorX, correct solution is http://jsfiddle.net/LkcgF/1/
[05:37:35] <VectorX> tiblock ok guess ill have to take that route then
[05:37:37] <VectorX> thanks
[05:37:43] <tiblock> VectorX, to check if key exists you can do data.hasOwnProperty('Queensland')
[05:38:11] <VectorX> yeah that was sort of what i was trying to do
[05:38:21] <VectorX> check its valid and then get the value at the index
[05:39:10] <sil3nti> Hello guys, is this the right way to hide the iframe if body = "" http://jsfiddle.net/RzaGL/3/ ?
[05:39:50] <Cork> sil3nti: if($(this).contents().find("body").empty())
[05:40:11] <Cork> opps sorry
[05:41:04] <Cork> sil3nti: if($(this).contents().find("body").is(":empty"))
[05:41:20] <Cork> .empty() will remove all the content ^^'
[05:42:11] <sil3nti> Cork: is not working http://jsfiddle.net/RzaGL/4/
[05:42:14] <tiblock> Cork, what is .load(function) will do? Documentation says it needs url to load
[05:42:37] <Cork> tiblock: shorthand for .on('load', function)
[05:43:03] <tiblock> ok, ty
[05:43:06] <Cork> sil3nti: you can only access the body of the iframe if it is from your domain
[05:43:17] <sil3nti> it is from my domain
[05:44:11] <Cork> sil3nti: you could try .children().length > 0
[05:44:19] <Cork> if you have spaces in there that might cause what you see
[05:44:54] <sil3nti> i think it has spaces beetwen <body>
[05:45:26] <Cork> sil3nti: then it won't be empty
[05:45:35] <Cork> try .children().length
[05:46:32] <sil3nti> do u mean like this:        if($(this).contents().find("body").children().length > 0
[05:47:15] <Cork> yes
[05:52:49] <sil3nti> Cork is not working ufff :(
[05:53:06] <Cork> sil3nti: what is $(this).contents().find("body").length?
[05:54:50] <sil3nti> what do u mean?
[05:55:17] <Cork> sil3nti: if you run console.log($(this).contents().find("body").length) in the event handler
[05:55:19] <Cork> what do you get?
[05:55:52] <sil3nti> 0
[05:55:53] <sil3nti> undefined
[05:56:56] <Cork> right
[05:57:06] <Cork> contents() doesn't return the document
[05:57:31] <Cork> contents().is(":empty") or contents().length > 0
[05:57:35] <Cork> should give you what you want
[06:00:40] <sil3nti> Cork: i get this on inspect elements http://prntscr.com/3xyh04
[06:01:17] <Cork> sil3nti: run console.log($(this).contents()) and inspect that result
[06:01:27] <Cork> as you see it isn't the same as what you linked
[06:01:50] <sil3nti> http://prntscr.com/3xyhir
[06:01:55] <Cork> sil3nti: iframes is replaced elements, so it isn't as simple as just inspecting the structure
[06:02:06] <Cork> uh
[06:02:11] <Cork> you ran that in the console...
[06:02:14] <Cork> not in the event
[06:02:21] <Cork> and ya in the console it won't work
[06:02:29] <Cork> as the this variable will point to window not the iframe
[06:02:36] <sil3nti> aha ok sry
[06:08:56] <rootyyy> could anyone give me a hand with making this code a little prettier? http://jsfiddle.net/tBLYy/
[06:18:00] <Cork> rook2pawn: http://jsfiddle.net/tBLYy/1/ ?
[06:26:36] <soee> how can i implode selected checkboxes values ?
[06:27:11] <Cork> soee: implode??
[06:28:05] <soee> Cork: yes to get value like: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
[06:28:13] <Cork> $.each($('input[type="checkbox"]').serializeArray(), function(elm) { elm.value; }).join(',')
[06:28:19] <Cork> should work
[06:28:27] <Cork> opps
[06:28:30] <soee> will try, one minute :)
[06:28:31] <Cork> $.map($('input[type="checkbox"]').serializeArray(), function(elm) { elm.value; }).join(',')
[06:30:45] <rootyyy>  could anyone give me a hand with making this code a little prettier? http://jsfiddle.net/tBLYy/
[06:31:11] <Cork> rootyyy: opps replied to the wrong nick
[06:31:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tBLYy/1/ ?
[06:35:38] <jacobrou-> is there any reason why a jquery mouse event wouldnt register and a browser css hover state would?
[06:35:59] <Cork> jacobrou-: depends on what event you're using
[06:36:17] <jacobrou-> tried click and mouseover
[06:36:22] <jacobrou-> in chrome, latest stable
[06:36:43] <Cork> jacobrou-: should work; could you create a demo in jsfiddle.net?
[06:36:52] <soee> Cork: { return elm.value; } was missing
[06:36:53] <jacobrou-> would think it should, yeah.
[06:37:37] <jacobrou-> i cant this moment, no
[06:37:48] <rootyyy> Cork thanks - but I need the .on() to look for animationStart too
[06:41:10] <gbro> anyone have any idea how to extend FancyProductDesigner? I have found this link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050985/best-way-to-extend-a-jquery-plugin but it doesnt seem to work
[07:08:46] <BillCriswell> Just got like 300 lines of CSS down to like 50. When someone doesn't understand how to use > it gets ugly.
[07:21:21] <djam90> I have an array as follows:   locations = [ "Leicester Welford Road" ]  and I am using: if( jQuery.inArray( "Leicester Welford Road" , locations) < 1) // then destroy this element.... but it is not finding the match, even though it is identical
[07:23:47] <Cork> djam90: http://jsfiddle.net/8UAh6/
[07:25:41] <BillCriswell> djam90: Your code should work as Cork pointed out. The index of that is 0 so it should match just fine even with your conditional.
[07:26:34] <djam90> hmm, I think I was using it wrong, I am basically trying to destroy every element that is NOT inside the locations var
[07:27:50] <BillCriswell> Are you using underscore by any chance? They have a _.without that could be useful.
[07:30:30] <EvgenyMorev> Good day
[07:31:55] <EvgenyMorev> All of my projects use jquery and include link to this file http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js but some days ago this link was broken. May you repair it?
[07:32:54] <BillCriswell> EvgenyMorev: That link works... but it seems pretty risky just linking to the latest version of jQuery for every project.
[07:33:00] <Cork> EvgenyMorev: -latest has never been supported for production hosting
[07:33:17] <Cork> and yes the links has been removed
[07:33:17] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/10
[07:33:39] <Cork> EvgenyMorev: grab a link from code.jquery.com and use that
[07:33:53] <Cork> and make controlled updated when you can make sure things keep working
[07:34:30] <EvgenyMorev> i have more than 200 projects and all of them use this link. http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js it's very bad news.
[07:34:45] <BillCriswell> Shit I'd say so.
[07:35:03] <EvgenyMorev> this link newer works again?
[07:35:45] <EvgenyMorev> guys, sorry for my english
[07:58:00] <decx> auto latest jq in 200 projects eh, i wonder what kind of subtle errors that produced if it's never been a problem
[07:58:18] <duch_kazatel> that's some insanity wolf style there
[07:58:22] <decx> hehe
[08:00:35] <FilipNortic> Yeah, and if alot of people where using it in production shutting it down seems like a good choice
[08:02:55] <noric> I need my users to take selfies, geo-tagged and timestamped, and have those selfies uploaded to me (and not stored elsewhere.) Is this possible with a web app, or will I need a native mobile app?
[08:03:57] <noric> Sorry to pose this question in #jquery, couldn't find a better channel with mobile web devs.
[08:04:44] <duch_kazatel> noric "and not stored elswhere" is going to be a challenge probably.
[08:04:46] <noric> I see that the camera can be accessed, I'm just wondering if there's a problem with any step of the selfie-geotag-timestamp-upload process
[08:05:20] <noric> they are welcome to keep the photo if they like, I just wouldn't want these photos polluting their personal albums/camera history, since these workers will be required to snap a selfie a few times a shift - "proof of attendance" for outdoor workers.
[08:05:27] <duch_kazatel> geotag and timestamp are defaults afaik.  but that last bit is the challenge i'm guessing.  everything else should be automatic.
[08:08:41] <NCS_One> hi
[08:08:46] <noric> duch_khazatel: if I require a worker to take a seflie every 30 minutes on a 5 hour shift, will those 10 pictures pollute his personal camera history?
[08:09:02] <noric> duch_khazatel: more worried about his experience as a worker/contractor than technical feasibility
[08:09:19] <noric> duch_khazatel: my workers use their own cellphones to be employed as contractors
[08:09:47] <duch_kazatel> your question seems really bizarre from the onset, but if by "pollute his personal camera history" you mean "have local copies stored in their gallery", then probably.
[08:10:05] <duch_kazatel> why are you making employees take selfies every 30 minutes?
[08:10:19] <NCS_One> someone using select2 please help me. Is there some way to execute a function after select2 initialization?
[08:11:07] <noric> duch_khazatel: they are unskilled laborers and selfies are proof-of-attendance :). It wouldn't be 30 minutes clockwork, more like a poisson distribution. I did mean "show up in their gallery", so I suppose I'll have to play with it. Would be annoying for a worker to earn $9/hr and go home to 10 pictures of his shift, in his private albums.
[08:11:55] <duch_kazatel> noric imo that's really invasive and excludes those people without smartphones.
[08:12:05] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One did you read the documentation?
[08:12:24] <uskerine> I doubt that might be legal in europe
[08:12:38] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: yes, didn't find a on init method, is there one?
[08:12:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah there are legal implications in many juridictions in the US, too.
[08:13:06] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One just making sure before i start dumpthing through them myself ;)
[08:13:14] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: :)
[08:13:17] <StanAccy> Is there a way in Chrome dev tools to see what script is hooked in to an <a> element - so I can see what jquery script executes when I click the link?
[08:14:08] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy if you mean a listener, yes - go to the "elements" tab and select the "Event Listeners" tab to the right.
[08:14:36] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One are you waiting for init of the dropdown, or the ajax to complete?
[08:14:49] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: Of course, thanks!
[08:14:54] <noric> tell me more about these legal restrictions. These are self-employed contractors opting in to shifts through my app. Sort of off topic, but am interested in any info.
[08:15:08] <noric> duch_khazatel uskerine: ^
[08:15:16] <iDevelop> Guys, does this shock anyone at all? https://mduk.pw/ijTR57
[08:15:21] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: none, I need it when select2 loads
[08:15:27] <duch_kazatel> noric seems like it'd be a relatively major invasion of privacy, but i'm not a lawyer so i'm not the one to ask.
[08:15:30] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One define "loads"
[08:15:58] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: after it creates it self
[08:16:00] <duch_kazatel> iDevelop http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/
[08:16:56] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One I'm not seeing anything, but that sounds like an XY problem - care to elaborate what you're trying to accomplish?
[08:17:00] <iDevelop> duch_kazatel: I know, but it doesn't shock you, does it?
[08:17:09] <gbro> Anyone have any idea how to change functionality of a plugin without changing the main files? Don't want changes to disappear when updates are added!
[08:17:22] <duch_kazatel> iDevelop not in the slightest, because user agent strings are much more complicated than that ;)
[08:17:34] <uskerine> noric > You should check a lawyer, but as per my country legislation you can't record employees. It would be consider like CCTV recording which must be handled by a security company -at least in my country- and only be accessed in the event of robbery/crime/etc.
[08:17:37] <duch_kazatel> gbro by extending the plugin.
[08:18:19] <gbro> duch_kazatel: can't seem to get that working, but all I'm working from is a stackoverflow page - are there tutorials on it?
[08:18:35] <duch_kazatel> gbro what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[08:19:26] <Automatik> hi
[08:19:45] <gbro> duch_kazatel: There's this plugin called fancyProductDesigner which does a whoooole bunch of logic which we need to change very slightly to work with our site - need to change a few of its functions, including its _init, in small ways
[08:20:39] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: when I select 1 option from the select2, some options disable form elements (user can not edit), but when I submit the form if it has errors it returns again to the form but the disabled elements are not disabled this time and I need to disable them. The code that disable the form elements are on "change" event
[08:20:50] <duch_kazatel> gbro that's going to be a little difficult - you can straight-up replace functions if you want, but i'm not aware of any super simple way.
[08:21:01] <Automatik> if I have a jquery reference to an object with $(this), how can I acces the "proper" property of this object? It seems that $(this).proper doesn't work
[08:21:15] <gbro> yeah replacing is fine - I'm planning to make my replacement functions call the default ones, then manipulate their return values
[08:21:40] <NoiseEee> Automatik: either $(this).prop('propName'), or if you're talking about the raw DOM element, just "this" not "$(this)"
[08:21:53] <duch_kazatel> gbro then check out how to write jquery plugins and start stompin' all over that plugins methods :)
[08:22:17] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One is the return via ajax?  or a pageload?
[08:23:34] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: page load
[08:23:50] <Automatik> thks :) so .prop() works even for a non-selector element
[08:24:02] <duch_kazatel> Automatik .prop() works for elements.
[08:24:11] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:24:19] <gbro> duch_kazatel: I'm really close to being able to do that - I just can't seem to find the main class anywhere in my scope to start messing with it
[08:24:33] <duch_kazatel> gbro *object.  there are no classes ;)
[08:24:47] <Automatik> so an object is an element?
[08:24:57] <duch_kazatel> Automatik an element is an object.
[08:25:09] <gbro> duch_kazatel: right, that :p
[08:25:15] <Automatik> ok!
[08:25:18] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One what is the initSelection callback?
[08:25:49] <duch_kazatel> NCS_One yeah, you want initSelection.
[08:27:50] <NCS_One> duch_kazatel: let me check it
[08:35:03] <gbro> so we know the local name of the object which does all of the plugin's heavy lifting, and we know exactly what we want to change and even how to do that, we just can't get access to that object - jQuery must be holding a reference to it somewhere though so it can use it itself?
[08:36:39] <duch_kazatel> gbro welcome to the pain of scoping - if you cannot access that object directly as a propery, then you have to rewrite its container.  is the object accessible to you?
[08:37:23] <gbro> don't think so - all that's exposed is a jQuery.fn property, which does "new object()", but not the object itself
[08:37:53] <duch_kazatel> then you'll be doing a whole lotta rewriting.
[08:38:05] <gbro> so this won't be compatible with future plugin updates
[08:38:08] <gbro> laaaaame
[08:55:29] <sdwrage> Hey all. Using the RoyalSlider plugin to create sliders for content but need to disable it at a certain breakpoint. Going to post on stack overflow but thought id see if anyone here was fluent with RoyalSlider as the product is being shown off in half an hour.
[08:56:10] <sdwrage> what I mean by disable is instead of slides, it will act as if I didn't apply RoyalSlider to div
[08:58:38] <Automatik> is there an equivalent of .get(number) which returns a jquery object?
[08:59:41] <Automatik> ah, probably the [] notation
[09:00:25] <BillCriswell> Automatik: .eq(n)
[09:01:14] <Automatik> thank you
[09:01:26] <wunz> when using ajax to make a web service/rest call and it returns the data object, is there any easy way to obtain the number of records returned without enumerating through each item and adding to a count?
[09:01:42] <BillCriswell> Automatik: No problem.
[09:02:10] <BillCriswell> wunz: response.results.length or something.
[09:02:54] <Automatik> http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Element says: "The jQuery object itself behaves much like an array; it has a length property and the elements in the object can be accessed by their numeric indices [0] to [length-1]." but it seems that [] doesn't work whereas .eq() works. Strange
[09:05:38] <duch_kazatel> Automatik depends on what you're trying to do.
[09:06:19] <Automatik> ok
[09:06:54] <duch_kazatel> Automatik for instance, you can't run jquery methods when using [] - you're accessing the underlying DOM node when you do that
[09:07:11] <Automatik> I see
[09:22:06] <VectorX> can some1 tell me why the data array is empty, i basically want to create and array of region in the data array and have all similar regions in that array http://jsfiddle.net/568Up/2/
[09:27:39] <duch_kazatel> VectorX you're mixing datatypes.
[09:27:46] <duch_kazatel> VectorX you want an object, not an array.
[09:28:04] <VectorX> ok, so how would i go about it
[09:28:40] <duch_kazatel> do you need named indexes in data?
[09:28:43] <duch_kazatel> or do you want an array?
[09:28:45] <VectorX> yes
[09:29:44] <duch_kazatel> which is it?
[09:30:19] <BillCriswell> Absolutely.
[09:30:32] <VectorX> im trying to categorise items by regions, so "South" will have all the item{\d} that has a region "South" then north etc
[09:30:40] <VectorX> so the region would be the named index
[09:31:34] <duch_kazatel> then you want an object.
[09:31:46] <VectorX> just updated the items to this format, so we can loop and create them http://jsfiddle.net/568Up/3/
[09:32:00] <VectorX> i made the previous example so i can figure out why it wasnt working
[09:32:01] <duch_kazatel> var data = {};
[09:32:06] <duch_kazatel> needs to be an object, not an array.
[09:34:05] <VectorX> duch_kazatel ok so http://jsfiddle.net/568Up/4/ ?
[09:34:15] <VectorX> looks like the correct output
[09:34:24] <duch_kazatel> but you cannot use .push()
[09:34:35] <VectorX> why not ?
[09:34:37] <duch_kazatel> you cannot use an array in this case.  arrays used numbered indexes.
[09:34:53] <duch_kazatel> if you need the indexes to be named, then you need to use an object.
[09:36:23] <VectorX> can i get your example
[09:36:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?  i don't have one.
[09:37:07] <VectorX> ok well i think from my last post im getting what i was expecting, i guess its a mix of object and array ?
[09:37:08] <duch_kazatel> ah, you'
[09:37:24] <duch_kazatel> all arrays are objects, not all objects are arrays.
[09:38:13] <VectorX> thanks for the help, i spent like 2 hours trying to figure out why this wasnt working
[09:38:29] <duch_kazatel> you'd do well to go read some tutorials
[09:38:45] <VectorX> yeah, i was looking for the wrong stuff
[09:39:20] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you're trying to accomplish here either way.
[09:39:59] <hlvwrk> So here's my issue today. http://jsfiddle.net/e2Fph/ in IE, when you're hovering over an item, and scroll down with the mouse, the focus doesn't get updated when you stop scrolling to the item that you're actually hovering over.
[09:40:03] <hlvwrk> Anyone have any ideas?
[09:41:03] <VectorX> duch_kazatel its a mess obviously, have to transfer a json object and derive some other data from it
[09:41:17] <duch_kazatel> VectorX shouldn't be a mess, but ok.
[09:48:11] <JenniferB2> I just started to use the animation css properties ... and using transform: translateY(-2000px); ... however ... I can not see where the element actually goes ... I was expecting left:-2000px; or top:-2000px; in firebug but cant see it ... the problem is that jQuery(element).is(':visible') is still returning true'
[09:48:26] <JenniferB2> here is a jsfiddle for it:
[09:48:28] <JenniferB2> http://jsfiddle.net/NgAa4/
[09:51:22] <Cork> JenniferB2: :visible has nothing to do with if it is actually on screen
[09:51:43] <Cork> it just tests if the element has display:none or not
[09:52:23] <uskerine> should this :$('#newInvoiceTotalTable textarea[name="invoiceSubtotal"]').val(invoiceSubtotal);
[09:52:46] <uskerine> update this: <table>.....   <textarea rows="1" name="invoiceSubtotal"></textarea> ..... </table>
[09:52:55] <uskerine> table id is newInvoiceTotalTable
[09:53:01] <Cork> uskerine: yes
[09:53:20] <duch_kazatel> assuming there's a parent with that id, yes
[09:53:24] <Cork> not the content between ></textarea>
[09:53:36] <Cork> but the value state of the field
[09:53:58] <uskerine> the textarea is not updated
[09:54:08] <uskerine> and the assumption is correct, the table ID corresponds with that ID
[09:54:59] <uskerine> forget it, 's' from Total was missing :o
[09:55:43] <BillCriswell> There's no S in Total.
[09:55:58] <Cork> uskerine: http://jsfiddle.net/As9yf/
[09:56:01] <duch_kazatel> and no I in Team
[09:56:11] <decx> not with that attitude BillCriswell
[09:56:34] <BillCriswell> http://www.1077theriver.ca/files/PS_0683_TEAM_IS.jpg
[09:56:39] <Cork> uskerine: make sure the html is valid so the text area really is inside the table
[09:56:49] <Cork> (and that you don't have two elements with that id)
[09:56:50] <uskerine> the ID was newTotals, not newTotal.
[09:56:56] <uskerine> my mistake sorry
[09:57:09] <JenniferB2> Cork, so how can I achieve what I after?
[09:57:23] <JenniferB2> Obviosuly this makes it hard to toggle slide in and out
[09:57:45] <Cork> JenniferB2: you would have to check the elements opsition and calculate its position
[09:57:49] <uskerine> I am not sure if totals is a valid English word, my English sucks
[09:57:59] <Cork> JenniferB2: or just set a class and check if that class is sat or not
[09:58:15] <shoky> or just use toggleClass
[09:58:20] <Cork> ya
[09:58:51] <BillCriswell> Pulp Fiction soundtrack is so good.
[09:59:47] <decx> totals, is that a bunch of wide-angle shots?
[10:01:08] <JenniferB2> Cork, the latter seems to be my current ooption ... the first option is not possible to my knowledge since top: xx is not actually set ...
[10:01:12] <JenniferB2> by transformY
[10:01:32] <JenniferB2> isVisible = function(element) {
[10:01:32] <JenniferB2>                         var clazz = element.attr('class');
[10:01:32] <JenniferB2>                         return element.is(":visible") || clazz.indexOf('slideIn') > -1;
[10:01:32] <JenniferB2>                 };
[10:01:49] <JenniferB2> perhaps the best option right now
[10:02:11] <shoky> `api hasClass
[10:02:12] <b-ot> shoky: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[10:02:14] <shoky> `api toggleClass
[10:02:17] <b-ot> shoky: .toggleClass(): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[10:02:23] <BillCriswell> shoky: Too fazt.
[10:02:32] <shoky> shiet
[10:03:18] <JenniferB2> shoky, yes .. but slideIn is not a class ... slideInUp slideInLeft is ..
[10:03:34] <shoky> then check for those
[10:03:39] <JenniferB2> so not to repeat it, better with indexOf for performance
[10:03:58] <shoky> don't make stuff up ;p
[10:04:17] <BillCriswell> What do you plan on doing with all that extra time you're going to save?
[10:06:23] <JenniferB2> BillCriswell, haha ... I am saving alot actually by not hasClass('slideInLeft') && hasClass('slideInUp') && hasClass('slideInBottom') ... and so on . ..
[10:06:45] <decx> if performance is of the essence then got native
[10:06:55] <decx> *-t
[10:07:13] <BillCriswell> JenniferB2: Are those classes added as the element is being animated or something?
[10:07:21] <JenniferB2> BillCriswell, yes
[10:07:38] <JenniferB2> decx, native meaning non jQuery?
[10:07:50] <hlvwrk> ._.
[10:07:52] <BillCriswell> JenniferB2: There's a :animated selector.
[10:07:56] <BillCriswell> animating?
[10:07:59] <BillCriswell> Some shit like that.
[10:08:02] <decx> well yeah
[10:08:15] <BillCriswell> Yes, :animated
[10:08:51] <BillCriswell> $el.is(':viible:animated') perhaps?
[10:08:52] <decx> otherwise it's like turning off the radio to save fuel while driving an suv
[10:09:04] <JenniferB2> BillCriswell, but it can be slideIn .. slideOut
[10:09:13] <BillCriswell> JenniferB2: Right.
[10:09:39] <BillCriswell> decx: My girlfriend asked me to take a case of water out of the trunk last night to save gas.
[10:10:05] <JenniferB2> I think having the naming as slideIn for visible and slideOut for hidden and check for that might be enough .. i will have to use the naming consisten though ..
[10:10:39] <BillCriswell> Would "slidIn" or "slidOut" make more sense in that case?
[10:10:40] <decx> how many thousand cubic meters of water did that case hold?
[10:10:51] <BillCriswell> 24 .5liters
[10:10:58] <BillCriswell> and you can convert it to whatever sane countries use.
[10:11:26] <JenniferB2> decx, I know I can do hasClass() .. twenty times, but why should I when my solution offers: 1) less code, 2) less redundancy and 3) better performance ...
[10:11:49] <JenniferB2> it is not like my brain exploded by writing element.attr('class').indexOf('slideIn') > -1
[10:12:15] <BillCriswell> JenniferB2: To each their own haha.
[10:12:36] <shoky> it didn't sound like you even need that isVisible
[10:12:39] <BillCriswell> I prefer hasClass because it's very clear what it's testing, but some people may prefer your way.
[10:13:05] <decx> at least do prop('classList') instead of attr('class')
[10:13:06] <BillCriswell> Also, does .attr('class') update as the class changed dynamically or do you need to do like .prop('class')
[10:13:30] <shoky> no classList in IE9
[10:13:32] <JenniferB2> what is the difference between prop and attr?
[10:13:44] <JenniferB2> I expect attr to return the current state of class
[10:13:45] <duch_kazatel> one reads the markup, the other the underlying property.
[10:13:54] <duch_kazatel> then you want .prop()
[10:14:11] <decx> what was it in <ie9
[10:14:13] <JenniferB2> which one corresponds to element.get(0).getAttribute('class') ?
[10:14:42] <JenniferB2> decx, perhaps going native is better :p
[10:14:55] <JenniferB2> Is there still any reason to why one should use jquery ?
[10:15:07] <shoky> .prop('className')
[10:15:23] <NoiseEee> JenniferB2: same reason as always?
[10:15:26] <decx> oh right, that's it
[10:15:37] <duch_kazatel> JenniferB2 sure - you want easier DOM traversal and manipulation.
[10:15:39] <BillCriswell> Doesn't seem to matter here: http://jsbin.com/rekubima/1/edit?html,js
[10:15:48] <duch_kazatel> though it's not the end all/be all for that.
[10:16:05] <decx> JenniferB2 i don't know what you're doing exactly i'm just chiming in random stuff i notice while watching football on the other screen
[10:17:12] <JenniferB2> decx, hehe me too .. france - nigeria?
[10:17:19] <BillCriswell> .getAttribute('class') would not keep it updated JenniferB2.
[10:17:47] <decx> yep,well at leaast until i fall asleep from the lack of things that happen
[10:17:49] <BillCriswell> I lied.
[10:17:57] <BillCriswell> I just can't read.
[10:18:08] <JenniferB2> http://jsbin.com/rekubima/3/edit
[10:18:15] <JenniferB2> BillCriswell, yes you did :0
[10:18:17] <JenniferB2> :)
[10:18:55] <decx> why do you externalize that in an isVisible function anyways when you can filter a selector directly?
[10:19:42] <decx> according to hype griezmann will now shoot 6 goals
[10:20:08] <JenniferB2> duch_kazatel, does that mean that if one goes non-jquery, you will loose some important functionality ? most of the find elements things are available in javascript nowadays... but perhaps for compatibility jquery is still important ... it costs around 40kb though
[10:20:46] <duch_kazatel> JenniferB2 I like it because I'm lazy and can type a little less, and I can let it take care of some cross-browser issues for me, instead of needing to always be aware.
[10:20:48] <duch_kazatel> there's a tradeoff
[10:21:36] <decx> if you target exclusively modern browsers it's nice to go native. anywhere else you end up using 50 shims/shivs/polyfills anyway
[10:22:27] <BillCriswell> I enjoy using jQuery. I'll spare the 40kb any day haha.
[10:23:48] <decx> if you use google cdn the cache penetration is like 80% (made up stat)
[10:23:49] <NoiseEee> 40kb = one less jpg
[10:24:11] <JenniferB2> duch_kazatel, "aware" that is exactly my reasoning ... if I switch I have to know how and wether the other way actually works
[10:24:17] <BillCriswell> If you optimize one image you probably saved double that lol
[10:24:51] <decx> i saved that times 10 by going lossy png
[10:26:06] <duch_kazatel> JenniferB2 that's why you should be able to do both.
[10:26:25] <JenniferB2> BillCriswell, wow .. i was just guessing about 42 kb ... it is actually 96kb minimized nowadays
[10:26:49] <JenniferB2> I noticed that there is a jquery 2.x now ... what is the advantage?
[10:26:57] <JenniferB2> better performance?
[10:27:12] <shoky> it's 32kb minified & gzipped
[10:27:29] <duch_kazatel> 2.x series drops support for old browsers.
[10:27:31] <duch_kazatel> 1.x keeps it.
[10:27:57] <BillCriswell> shoky: Thanks for confirming. That number seemed way too high.
[10:28:20] <JenniferB2> shoky, yeah, gzipped .. but minified is the way to measure ;)
[10:28:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?  why?
[10:28:51] <shoky> no, it's not ;p
[10:29:12] <adavia> one question.. is it bad practice to use the onclick event in the html button?
[10:29:32] <duch_kazatel> adavia yes - put your handler in your JS instead.
[10:30:04] <jmitchel> hey, I'
[10:30:15] <JenniferB2> duch_kazatel, because three libraries with 96kb might each be 32 kb each, but together they might be 64kb ... so with gzipping the size becomes non-fixed :p
[10:30:16] <jmitchel> I'm having problems getting .when to block ajax calls
[10:30:26] <jmitchel> http://pastebin.com/LmDqpWX7
[10:30:26] <adavia> duch_kazatel:  what if i need to make a generic ajax function in my js and send some parameters from the onclick event
[10:30:54] <duch_kazatel> adavia that doesn't change anything.  check out .on()
[10:31:06] <jmitchel> I was wondering if anyone can explain why .when doesn't wait for the success functions to run?
[10:31:07] <duch_kazatel> adavia what you really want is to bind to the form's submit event.
[10:32:02] <adavia> duch_kazatel:  but i will always need to rewrite the same ajax function that way
[10:32:12] <duch_kazatel> adavia huh?  why?
[10:32:18] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code to show why you think that?
[10:32:55] <jmitchel> duch_kazatel: you talkin to me?  http://pastebin.com/LmDqpWX7
[10:33:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm talking to adavia
[10:33:12] <jmitchel> ah sorry
[10:33:22] <adavia> ok let me show
[10:33:24] <BillCriswell> Damn, pastebin with the ads with sound.
[10:33:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'm close to not opening pastebin links any more.
[10:33:48] <BillCriswell> I thought I downloaded a Bob Dylan remix I didn't know about.
[10:34:24] <jmitchel> is there a better pastebin than pastebin?
[10:34:55] <duch_kazatel> !paste
[10:34:55] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:35:00] <BillCriswell> jmitchel: You could make a demo at jsbin or jsfiddle, if you want plain text there's pastie.org that I always liked.
[10:35:09] <duch_kazatel> fixee is p. good, too.
[10:35:14] <BillCriswell> Whoa, preferred?
[10:35:51] <duch_kazatel> that's always been the case around these parts.
[10:36:03] <remysharp> remysharp prefers jsbin :)
[10:36:12] <BillCriswell> So does BillCriswell.
[10:36:44] <duch_kazatel> Robert thinks you're all weird.
[10:37:04] <JenniferB2> jsfiddle is slow ... i kind of liked jsbin .. although there was a lot of clicking but much faster load time
[10:37:12] <jmitchel> yeah, there's some django template things in this that would make demoing this rull hard...here's a fixee repost http://fixee.org/paste/kz0twai/
[10:37:33] <StanAccy> Im trying to debug a jquery script/effect thats tied to an anchor element.  Is there a way in chrome to set a breakpoint to see where in one of 30 scripts the actual jquery JS is being executed?
[10:37:42] <BillCriswell> I think all beefs with jsbin would be squashed if the "auto-run JS" wasn't checked off the bat.
[10:38:10] <remysharp> BillCriswell: you think? Is that a common issue?
[10:39:24] <BillCriswell> It's the complaint I hear the most often in here. There's been a few times I froze things up with the checked, but not enough to make me want it that way by default.
[10:39:33] <BillCriswell> remysharp: ^
[10:40:20] <shoky> jmitchel: i'd recommend using .then to transform the response data, instead of using globals like that. http://jsfiddle.net/2B5HJ/
[10:40:46] <BillCriswell> Like .add($foo) froze it up for me, cause it tried to do .add($).
[10:41:00] <adavia> duch_kazatel:  something like this http://jsfiddle.net/u2ZzY/
[10:41:19] <remysharp> BillCriswell: just as a yes/no, do you know what the keyboard command is to run the output with js?
[10:41:55] <BillCriswell> remysharp: No.
[10:42:37] <jmitchel> shoky: I like the idea...but can I "var" instantiate an array and still run through my .each push...fixee incoming
[10:43:03] <shoky> jmitchel: you can, but that's gross and there's no need for it
[10:44:05] <remysharp> BillCriswell: I'll raise a proposal for that change. I'm not quite sure if it's the right thing or not. I suspect with some clever UX it could be off by default, but encourage smarter users to enable it - or highlight that cmd (or ctrl if windows) + enter will run all your code.
[10:44:23] <jmitchel> shoky: hmm...I can understand how that is gross, but not how to fix it
[10:44:55] <shoky> jmitchel: fix what
[10:45:18] <jmitchel> shoky: I've got an array returning from the .ajax...parsing that, and then I need to take eached parsed element and somehow get it in the new array
[10:45:24] <BillCriswell> remysharp: I agree about it not being the right thing. I like it, but I also know when to turn it off.
[10:45:30] <shoky> jmitchel: yes, do it like in my fiddle.
[10:45:37] <remysharp> BillCriswell: https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/1617
[10:46:37] <BillCriswell> Interested to hear what others say.
[10:48:09] <jphase> I personally don't mind it remysharp
[10:48:53] <jphase> there's at least a type ahead type thing where if you just keep typing it (seems) to not run automatically, so for me it works. I don't mind clicking the clear button in my console :\
[10:49:33] <shoky> jmitchel:  http://jsfiddle.net/2B5HJ/1/
[10:49:49] <remysharp> jsbin pro tip: cmd+? - keyboard shortcuts, no more clicking :)
[10:49:51] <jmitchel> shoky: I'm not sure that your example parses the json, it just grabs it and throws it away...http://fixee.org/paste/mps27nx/
[10:50:23] <shoky> jmitchel: you can parse the json if you want. also you can just do dataType: 'json' and it
[10:50:23] <jmitchel> shoky: o wait, just saw your new one let me check that out
[10:50:29] <shoky> jmitchel: and it'll parse it for you automatically
[10:50:49] <shoky> jmitchel: jsfiddle's json echo doesn't want to return an array so i simulated it just for working in jsfiddle
[11:00:06] <jmitchel> shoky: not finished yet, but I'm on the right track.  I really appreciate your help!
[12:11:41] <skinux> How do we get all form elements?
[12:12:14] <skinux> $("#SomeForm input").each(...); ??
[12:12:50] <BillCriswell> skinux: There's a :input selector.
[12:13:07] <skinux> How exactly do I use it?
[12:13:13] <BillCriswell> That gets like inputs plus textareas.
[12:13:20] <BillCriswell> skinux: Instead of "input" you type ":input"
[12:13:28] <BillCriswell> $('#someForm :input')
[12:13:35] <BillCriswell> skinux: What are you trying to do though?
[12:13:49] <skinux> Does that return an array of all input methods?
[12:14:19] <BillCriswell> It returns a jQuery object with all the forms input type elements.
[12:14:33] <BillCriswell> skinux: What are you trying to do though? Might be a better approach.
[12:16:11] <skinux> I want to iterate through database rows, fill each form element (4-6 elements per db row) with value stored in database
[12:16:47] <BillCriswell> So you have some empty inputs that you want to populate with values from a database?
[12:16:59] <skinux> I'm trying to make a tiny app to edit database entries.
[12:17:04] <skinux> Yes.
[12:17:46] <BillCriswell> That feels a little weird. Why not output the inputs with the values populated already?
[12:18:10] <skinux> Because I want this app to be jquery driven
[12:19:35] <skinux> I'm tired of developing server-side scripts that always require page reloading. I want to develop my JS/JSON skill.
[12:20:09] <BillCriswell> skinux: So you're going to create a form, then grab the data for the form, then populate the form using that data instead of building a form with that data then appending it to the dom?
[12:20:52] <skinux> No, the form should be created and populated after retrieving data from database.
[12:21:03] <BillCriswell> skinux: Oh ok, just making sure!
[12:21:06] <mmazing> i have a form where i have to dynamically change the form controls sometimes (checking/unchecking checkboxes, etc), when i submit the form i get all the data just fine, but when i hit back, the browser doesn't remember what the form was (it does remember if i manually click things)
[12:21:12] <mmazing> using chrome, any ideas?
[12:21:27] <BillCriswell> skinux: So why do you need to grab all the form elements?
[12:23:32] <skinux> I simply need to be able to fill in all of the values from the database.
[12:24:59] <BillCriswell> skinux: I understand that, but how will you know what values are coming from the database in order to generate this form that you want to select all the inputs from?
[12:33:53] <skinux> The values will come as JSON, so I'll iterate through JSON object for all appropriate values and set form fields to those values.
[12:35:00] <skinux> Is it really more commonly wise to populate form on server-side and use JSON request to submit any changes to those entries????
[12:35:22] <duch_kazatel> what's going on now?
[12:35:26] <BillCriswell> skinux: I'm not suggesting that. I'm just not following why you need to select those inputs.
[12:35:39] <BillCriswell> Since as you said you'repopulating them with json data haha
[12:35:47] <skinux> I just need to be able to place data into the fields.
[12:36:01] <duch_kazatel> skinux is this a case where there would be default values?
[12:36:23] <skinux> Technically, I'm populating them with data from database, JSON is format I'm using to retrieve data from database using AJAX.
[12:36:48] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question :) will this data need to populate on pageload?
[12:37:12] <skinux> duch_kazatel: No, all values would be from entries (rows) previously submitted to database.
[12:37:34] <skinux> Yes, all fields need to be populated on page load.
[12:37:51] <duch_kazatel> do the initial prepopulation server-side.
[12:37:53] <duch_kazatel> if possible.
[12:38:18] <skinux> I can do that, but I'd really prefer to improve my skill with JS/JSON.
[12:38:22] <BillCriswell> skinux: $.get('/items/2').done(function (row){ $('body').append('<form><input name="foo" value="' + row.foo + '"></form>'); }); <-- Why after this would you need to select the inputs in the form?
[12:38:52] <duch_kazatel> skinux the first big lesson with JS is knowing when not to use it.
[12:39:01] <duch_kazatel> unless this is for some personal small learning deal.
[12:39:47] <skinux> BillCriswell: Ohh....I wouldn't because you've already populated all fields with that code.
[12:40:07] <BillCriswell> skinux: That's all I'm saying. I wasn't following why you'd need to select those inputs.
[12:40:57] <skinux> Yeah...duh...I need to populate fields as they are written to the page.
[12:41:21] <skinux> You guys may have a big point about using server-side to initially populate, though.
[12:42:20] <disappearedng> https://gist.github.com/vicngtor/9a7ca115c2cb6fddb977 Hey can someone tell me the purpose of the bind(this) mean?
[12:42:28] <skinux> I already have code for doing that, I'll have to modify it to create forms instead of simply displaying informaiton.
[12:45:38] <duch_kazatel> disappearedng https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[12:46:26] <decx> this in the callbacks is now componentWillMount and not the ajax call
[12:46:54] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good plugin with which I can test standard form input fields?
[12:47:02] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam for validation?
[12:48:02] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: yep
[12:48:12] <duch_kazatel> I'
[12:48:16] <duch_kazatel> *I'm using http://jqueryvalidation.org right now.
[12:48:21] <disappearedng> duch_kazatel: Oh ok thanks dawg. I was looking up $.bind('eventType' and I was wondering wtf is going on
[12:48:26] <sunbeam> name, last name, password, email, address
[12:48:31] <sunbeam> just only those
[12:48:44] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam jquery validate is a fantastic place to start.
[12:48:46] <duch_kazatel> or write your own.
[12:59:36] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: I will try your plugin
[13:13:40] <DaAlexMax> Hi.  Got a quick question.  I've got a form with a submit() event handler.  This event works in every single browser I've tried EXCEPT for internet exporer 8
[13:13:57] <DaAlexMax> In IE8, I mash and mash on the form and I get no love
[13:14:27] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to prevent the event?
[13:14:39] <DaAlexMax> It's an AJAX post, so I'm using 		ev.preventDefault(); to do an ajax post instead of a normal one.
[13:14:52] <duch_kazatel> so what part specifically isn't working?
[13:15:13] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: It's as if the form submit button was a dud.
[13:15:23] <DaAlexMax> I get no error message
[13:15:27] <duch_kazatel> so the ajax never fires?
[13:15:43] <DaAlexMax> but I mash and mash on "Submit" and it does nothing.  I put a console log in the submit() callback function and it doesn't console log.
[13:15:52] <DaAlexMax> Correct
[13:15:54] <duch_kazatel> could you share your code, then?
[13:15:59] <DaAlexMax> I'm using jQuery 1.11
[13:16:04] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ DaAlexMax
[13:16:04] <b-ot> DaAlexMax: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:17:11] <DaAlexMax> JS bins don't work in IE8
[13:17:27] <duch_kazatel> nor do fiddles.  fixee.org would be good.
[13:17:30] <duch_kazatel> just need to see the code.
[13:17:59] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: one sec
[13:27:50] <DaAlexMax> Dammnit
[13:27:58] <DaAlexMax> Chrome chose that moment to lag to heck
[13:28:00] <DaAlexMax> lost my window
[13:28:01] <DaAlexMax> anyway
[13:28:06] <DaAlexMax> here is the form
[13:28:08] <DaAlexMax> http://pastebin.com/4gdFmL7Y
[13:28:51] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: ^^^
[13:29:02] <duch_kazatel> and you said that your console.log isn't even being hit?
[13:29:07] <DaAlexMax> The first one is
[13:29:09] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:29:10] <DaAlexMax> "Hi" is rendered
[13:29:13] <DaAlexMax> but "eh..." never is
[13:29:32] <DaAlexMax> Note that this itself an HTML fragment that is written into the page
[13:29:39] <duch_kazatel> that's why.
[13:29:52] <DaAlexMax> Huh?  What does that have to do with anything?
[13:29:56] <DaAlexMax> or rather
[13:30:00] <DaAlexMax> How does that change things?
[13:30:04] <duch_kazatel> the fragment gets written after the page loads, right?
[13:30:08] <DaAlexMax> Yes
[13:30:14] <DaAlexMax> this is the fragment in its entirety
[13:30:17] <duch_kazatel> you can't bind to something that doesn't exist.
[13:30:27] <DaAlexMax> But it does exist
[13:30:31] <duch_kazatel> the fragment doesn't exist on pageload, which is when the binding tries to run.
[13:30:37] <duch_kazatel> it exists after the page loads.
[13:30:52] <duch_kazatel> what's the name of the element you're appending to?
[13:31:11] <DaAlexMax> TextmessageFormForm_40788
[13:31:24] <DaAlexMax> Which is, if you look at the top line, the form element in question
[13:31:40] <duch_kazatel> you said that this is a fragment that's getting written to the page.
[13:31:44] <DaAlexMax> Yes.
[13:31:45] <duch_kazatel> what does that id get appended to?
[13:32:30] <DaAlexMax> What do you mean?
[13:32:38] <duch_kazatel> does this HTML get appended to the page on pageload?
[13:32:53] <DaAlexMax> On page load?  That's kind of fuzzy
[13:32:58] <DaAlexMax> let me check
[13:33:02] <DaAlexMax> to see if it does on document load
[13:33:04] <duch_kazatel> is it getting appended by javascript, then?
[13:33:21] <duch_kazatel> basically, you can
[13:33:46] <duch_kazatel> *can't bind to something that doesn't yet exist.  if this code gets added to the page with javascript, you should use event delegation instead.
[13:33:47] <DaAlexMax> Yes.  The fragment that I pasted is loaded into the page via javascript
[13:34:01] <duch_kazatel> okay - what is the parent element you append it to?
[13:34:17] <DaAlexMax> The parent element is TextmessageBox_4
[13:34:38] <duch_kazatel> and that's apart of the page itself, before any javascript runs?
[13:34:51] <DaAlexMax> I do it with $('#TextmessageBox_4').load('url/to/fragment');
[13:34:52] <DaAlexMax> yes
[13:35:09] <duch_kazatel> then swap $('#TextmessageFormForm_' + broker_id).submit(function(ev) { for $('#TextmessageBox_4').on('submit', '#TextmessageFormForm_' + broker_id, function(ev) {
[13:35:15] <duch_kazatel> see if that doesn't change anything.
[13:35:34] <DaAlexMax> Same place?
[13:35:49] <duch_kazatel> yes.  replace your current submit for the one I just pasted in.
[13:38:50] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: For some reason, this causes the form to disappear completely after one or two submissions
[13:39:32] <Nindustries> Hi guys! Trying out handlebars templating/jQuery Mobile with my first webapp. But, my link doesnt work.. If you browse to http://d00med.net/cordova , you'll see the Register button does not work. But looking at the source and manually clicking the "#register" part in the href works
[13:40:27] <duch_kazatel> DaAlexMax you're doing box.html(data); might want to check the data coming back.
[13:41:47] <duch_kazatel> also, ditch your .always() - you don't need it.
[13:42:33] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: Check for what?  I'm supposed to get an HTML fragment in return, which contains either a thank you html fragment or the same form again with validation errors pointed out an a new CSRF token
[13:42:56] <Bray90820> How would I add an image to a lightbox set without it showing on the page
[13:43:12] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what the difference is between what you had and what I just gave you, DaAlexMax?
[13:44:16] <DaAlexMax> Not at all.  I think I've used 'on' before, but long ago.
[13:44:35] <duch_kazatel> that version of on() allows you to make use of event delegation.
[13:44:43] <DaAlexMax> Event delegation?
[13:44:49] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[13:44:59] <duch_kazatel> events bubble up through the document.
[13:45:11] <duch_kazatel> this lets you bind a delegated listener to a parent node.
[13:45:12] <DaAlexMax> I'm sorry.  I usually do try to comprehend stuff instead of just merely copy-pasting, but I'm kind of in a hurry. :P
[13:45:20] <DaAlexMax> Ah, I see.
[13:45:23] <DaAlexMax> That makes sense
[13:45:37] <duch_kazatel> this way you can change the children of that element without needing to worry about binding.
[13:45:53] <DaAlexMax> But what doesn't make sense is why I'm getting form blanks.
[13:46:17] <DaAlexMax> Perhaps it's getting some stale form data with a bad CSRF token and trying to pass it back in again?
[13:46:24] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what all of your code is doing
[13:46:24] <duch_kazatel> ?
[13:46:26] <DaAlexMax> which causes the form to blank
[13:47:12] <DaAlexMax> I believe so.
[13:47:21] <duch_kazatel> your box and form vars don't make any sense.
[13:47:38] <duch_kazatel> the event target of the form submission should be the form itself.
[13:48:13] <DaAlexMax> Exactly.  So I grab that, serialize the data and post it
[13:48:34] <duch_kazatel> then why do var box = $('#TextmessageBox_' + broker_id); ?
[13:48:54] <duch_kazatel> because you could reduce that all down to http://fixee.org/paste/vrejj3b/
[13:49:27] <DaAlexMax> TextmessageBox is the enclosing div
[13:49:32] <DaAlexMax> TextmessageFormForm is the form
[13:49:39] <DaAlexMax> they're two separate items
[13:50:32] <DaAlexMax> If I'm parsing what you're doing correctly, it basically make a nest of <form><form><form><form> tags, no?
[13:50:34] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  okay.  try this: http://fixee.org/paste/vrejj3b/#7547=&url=q8lx60h
[13:52:22] <DaAlexMax> Oh I see what's going on
[13:52:31] <DaAlexMax> had to look at the AJAX tab
[13:52:35] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[13:52:41] <DaAlexMax> no no no
[13:52:48] <DaAlexMax> with your code the first time I click submit I get one submission
[13:52:52] <DaAlexMax> The second time i get two.
[13:52:56] <DaAlexMax> The third time i get four
[13:53:18] <duch_kazatel> is this in a function you call to bind new listeners?
[13:53:42] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: That HTML fragment I showed you gets reloaded!
[13:53:42] <duch_kazatel> or are you running this once?
[13:53:48] <duch_kazatel> including the JS?
[13:53:51] <DaAlexMax> yeppers!
[13:53:52] <duch_kazatel> don't load JS in like that.
[13:54:04] <duch_kazatel> separations on concern.
[13:54:07] <duch_kazatel> *of
[13:54:08] <DaAlexMax> well
[13:54:10] <DaAlexMax> before I do that
[13:54:17] <DaAlexMax> let me make sure that your new invocation works in IE8
[13:54:45] <duch_kazatel> it might not, since I didn't realize by "html fragment" you mean "and javascript"
[13:55:17] <duch_kazatel> *meant - IE8 might not be executing that JS, too.
[13:57:18] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: Why wouldn't it?
[13:57:22] <DaAlexMax> And it actually is!
[13:57:29] <DaAlexMax> because remember that first console.log is being printed
[13:57:34] <DaAlexMax> it's just that the event handler doesn't work
[13:57:34] <duch_kazatel> all right.  wasn't sure if that'd trip a security issue.
[13:57:42] <DaAlexMax> no worries
[13:57:53] <duch_kazatel> either way, get that js out of your return,
[13:58:14] <DaAlexMax> The problem is that this this is really weird
[13:58:26] <DaAlexMax> the site I'm working on doesn't load jquery until the bottom of the page
[13:58:35] <duch_kazatel> sounds about right.
[13:58:41] <DaAlexMax> and then it processes an array of jquery invocations
[13:58:46] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:58:47] <DaAlexMax> that's kind of a pain in the neck to get just right
[13:58:54] <DaAlexMax> because it switches everything around
[13:59:25] <DaAlexMax> For what it's worth
[13:59:28] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[13:59:31] <DaAlexMax> that event handler doesn't work in IE8 either
[13:59:41] <DaAlexMax> i mash submit all day long and it doesn't work
[13:59:48] <DaAlexMax> Maybe I can bind to the submit button itself
[13:59:56] <duch_kazatel> try binding that delegated listener outside of dynamically generated/dynamically loaded js.
[14:00:01] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[14:00:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll wind up having other issues.
[14:00:12] <duch_kazatel> bind the right way first.
[14:01:14] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: Okay
[14:02:34] <peterR``> does jquery come as only a single .js file?
[14:02:51] <duch_kazatel> that's a common way to use it, yes.
[14:03:40] <peterR``> is there another way to get hold of it?
[14:03:51] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.
[14:03:54] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[14:04:10] <peterR``> just download it :)
[14:04:17] <duch_kazatel> then download the file.
[14:04:36] <peterR``> OK - there's no zip or install or anything like that
[14:04:51] <duch_kazatel> are you learning how to use it?
[14:05:02] <peterR``> I will be in about 10 minutes
[14:05:03] <baskwalla> Hello all
[14:05:05] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/
[14:05:11] <duch_kazatel> start there, peterR``
[14:05:38] <baskwalla> I'm trying to create a cutom route and method but I'm getting a not defined error. http://laravel.io/bin/OL7v3 Any ideas?
[14:05:41] <duch_kazatel> basically, there's nothing to install.  you simply drop it into your project and use it.
[14:06:00] <peterR``> and I would put it on the webserver?
[14:06:07] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` yes.
[14:06:21] <peterR``> any directory I like or is there a convention?
[14:06:22] <duch_kazatel> usually in a folder with all your other script files.
[14:06:26] <peterR``> I see
[14:07:25] <duch_kazatel> you could further separate them into one folder for libraries and another folder for things you write.
[14:07:47] <peterR``> and do you recommend version 1 or 2?
[14:08:00] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[14:08:28] <duch_kazatel> the latest in each both have almost the exact same featureset.  if you need to support old browsers, select 1.  2 drops support for them.
[14:08:37] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, they are identical.
[14:08:38] <Nindustries> Nobody with an idea for my problem?
[14:09:16] <duch_kazatel> Nindustries sorry - i don't know anything about handlebars.
[14:09:18] <sumperson> think about those ie6 users....
[14:09:26] <_August_> can someone help me real quick, im moving some ad's based on the width of the browser and when i get to my target width, the site keeps going blank. this is my site, this is my code http://pastebin.com/9rNDBm0F
[14:09:32] <duch_kazatel> sumperson or 8.  we make a lot of money of of 8 users at my work.
[14:09:33] <_August_> http://courtsideaccess.com/
[14:09:51] <_August_> i cant figure it out for the life of me
[14:09:56] <sumperson> only 2% ie users here...
[14:10:10] <duch_kazatel> sumperson not percentage of traffic - percentage of revenue ;)
[14:10:18] <sumperson> i see very nice
[14:10:24] <Nindustries> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the headsup
[14:11:48] <peterR``> I have a feeling all our customers are IE
[14:12:11] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` why do you say that?
[14:12:20] <duch_kazatel> Nindustries a lot of us also don't like dumping through an entire page - can you narrow down your problem to something more specific?
[14:12:24] <peterR``> they are the government :)
[14:12:25] <nhulea> howdy
[14:12:33] <duch_kazatel> nhulea whuddup nhulea
[14:12:59] <nhulea> shiiiittt just working thought id say hi
[14:13:10] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` ah, yeah.  use the 1.x series then :)
[14:13:19] <Nindustries> duch_kazatel: Well, clicking on my link doesn't call the hashChange event on my page. Manually opening source in the browser and clicking #register does work tough.. I have no idea why
[14:13:39] <Nindustries> Source is at https://github.com/HazCod/Quackr/blob/master/js/index.js
[14:13:42] <duch_kazatel> Nindustries something tells me you're binding to something that doesn't yet exist.
[14:14:31] <Nindustries> duch_kazatel: Hmm.. I only call app.initialize(); at the end of the webpage tough (in the footer)
[14:14:43] <Nindustries> duch_kazatel: See https://github.com/HazCod/Quackr/blob/master/index.html
[14:15:15] <duch_kazatel> like i said, i'd rather not dump through the entire page ;) might want to ask in a channel about backbone.
[14:15:28] <peterR``> so a simple example with datepicker: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15544984/getting-started-with-jquery-datepicker
[14:15:32] <peterR``> does that actually work?
[14:15:45] <Nindustries> backbone?
[14:15:48] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` use learn.jquery.com
[14:15:52] <duch_kazatel> err, handlebars.
[14:15:58] <Nindustries> ahh, ok :D
[14:16:00] <duch_kazatel> Nindustries i meant handlebars.
[14:16:04] <Nindustries> Thanks for trying tough duch_kazatel
[14:16:36] <duch_kazatel> Nindustries you're not likely to get much help here either way.  you might get lucky.
[14:16:53] <Nindustries> I know, nothing wrong with trying right?  #web also can't help
[14:17:07] <duch_kazatel> eh, i'd argue that it's off topic and derails the conversation.
[14:18:53] <Nindustries> #handlebars might help me, unless it's about facial hair
[14:19:06] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[14:23:27] <peterR``> you need jquery-ui.js as well?
[14:23:41] <duch_kazatel> only if you're going to use its features.
[14:23:44] <duch_kazatel> not required at all.
[14:23:50] <duch_kazatel> i personally avoid it.
[14:23:57] <peterR``> for date picker?
[14:24:12] <duch_kazatel> do not learn off that stack overflow article.
[14:24:16] <peterR``> I am not
[14:24:36] <peterR``> I am looking at the example for datepicker http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#default
[14:24:42] <duch_kazatel> that requires jquery-ui, then.,
[14:25:01] <peterR``> if you needed a datepicker would you use something else?
[14:25:13] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: It gets worse
[14:25:22] <DaAlexMax> Well, the problem is worse than I thought
[14:25:29] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` i wouldn't include all of jquery-ui just for a datepicker, no.
[14:25:45] <DaAlexMax> In IE8 and IE8 only, when I html(whatever) into the page, _the dom that is visible to me is not updated in IE8_
[14:26:02] <DaAlexMax> in other words, selectors that target the html fragment don't work!
[14:26:14] <DaAlexMax> i can literally copy paste a selector that works in chrome but doesn't work in IE8
[14:26:18] <DaAlexMax> wtc
[14:26:31] <duch_kazatel> selector, or call to .html()?
[14:27:19] <duch_kazatel> because .html() will break if the returned markup is invalid.
[14:27:38] <duch_kazatel> IE8 really doesn't like invalid markup.
[14:28:36] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: I read an article somwhere that suggested empty().append()
[14:28:42] <DaAlexMax> didn't work
[14:28:48] <duch_kazatel> right, your html is invalid.
[14:28:50] <duch_kazatel> fix that first.
[14:29:17] <DaAlexMax> actually
[14:29:18] <DaAlexMax> wait huh
[14:29:26] <DaAlexMax> empty()append() DOES work
[14:29:54] <DaAlexMax> actually no it doesnt
[14:30:04] <duch_kazatel> right - your HTML is invalid.  correct that first.
[14:30:04] <DaAlexMax> I do see it in the DOM viewer
[14:30:09] <DaAlexMax> but the selector doesn't work still
[14:30:13] <DaAlexMax> yeah, I'll fix it
[14:30:30] <DaAlexMax> when does XP go into no more support again?
[14:30:37] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[14:30:49] <DaAlexMax> not soon enough
[14:30:49] <DaAlexMax> anyway
[14:30:52] <DaAlexMax> it's 5:30
[14:30:52] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't really make much of a difference if you're still making money ;)
[14:30:54] <DaAlexMax> i'm outta here
[14:30:58] <duch_kazatel> this isn't IE's fault btw.
[14:30:59] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help
[14:31:06] <duch_kazatel> you're not closing your form.
[14:31:27] <DaAlexMax> duch_kazatel: huh?
[14:31:28] <DaAlexMax> oh crap
[14:31:29] <DaAlexMax> you're right
[14:31:30] <DaAlexMax> ugh
[14:31:33] <DaAlexMax> In my defense
[14:31:34] <duch_kazatel> this is not the fault of IE.
[14:31:44] <DaAlexMax> yeah, this is me using CakePHP's form stuff incorrectly
[14:32:07] <DaAlexMax> In the source file, it's actually a bunch of calls to a "form helper" that generates HTML for me
[14:32:14] <DaAlexMax> and I just forgot the thing that closes the form.
[14:32:20] <DaAlexMax> Don't know why I didn't notice that sooner
[14:32:23] <DaAlexMax> probably because I'm a doofus
[14:32:28] <DaAlexMax> thanks for your help duch_kazatel
[14:32:45] <duch_kazatel> sure
[14:33:07] <AlexMax> duch_kazatel: thanks :)
[14:33:21] <DaAlexMax> ugh, why does my hostmask not show up
[14:33:23] <DaAlexMax> need to fix that
[14:33:37] <duch_kazatel> AlexMax hrm?
[14:33:44] <duch_kazatel> why are there two of you wtf.
[14:33:50] <AlexMax> duch_kazatel: One is work-me
[14:33:58] <AlexMax> the other is my personal VPS IRC client me
[14:34:11] <duch_kazatel> kay
[14:34:29] <_1_golden4> hi
[14:34:38] <duch_kazatel> hello
[14:34:48] <emx> is it possible to have two instances of fancybox?
[14:34:57] <duch_kazatel> emx come again?
[14:35:13] <duch_kazatel> emx you mean two different ones on the same page?
[14:35:22] <duch_kazatel> or two different copies of the library?
[14:35:38] <_1_golden4> how are you?
[14:35:42] <emx> duch_kazatel, i mean having two fancybox dialogues open at the same time
[14:36:10] <duch_kazatel> emx not that i'm aware of - why would you have two different dialogues open at once?
[14:36:38] <_1_golden4> ok
[14:38:00] <emx> duch_kazatel, 1.) fancybox is used to show loginmask. 2.) there is the case that a fancybox is open for userinput. it may happen that while fancybox is open the user is auto-logged-out. when he clicks a button (e.g. to store data) then the login dialogue must open (to allow login and prevent data loss)
[14:38:07] <duch_kazatel> "loginmask"?
[14:38:25] <duch_kazatel> i still can't see why you have two open.
[14:38:40] <emx> duch_kazatel, you know username, password, login button
[14:39:09] <emx> duch_kazatel, imagin a fancybox login mask
[14:39:16] <emx> that one is closed
[14:39:18] <duch_kazatel> i've never heard that called a login mask.
[14:39:24] <duch_kazatel> i see the case you're coming up with now.
[14:39:38] <duch_kazatel> you might be able to do it, but that seems like a really strange use case imo.
[14:40:10] <emx> duch_kazatel, what would you do?
[14:40:50] <duch_kazatel> not use a modal for login and find a way to not log the user out while an input modal is open.
[14:40:58] <duch_kazatel> at least, have there be a longer timeout.
[14:42:01] <emx> duch_kazatel, what if the timeout is a day and the user waits a day and a second?
[14:42:13] <duch_kazatel> i'd think one day is reasonable.
[14:42:38] <duch_kazatel> we do something like 30 minutes from the last action in that session iirc.
[14:43:40] <emx> duch_kazatel, i think it is still much prettier to have the user log in and automatically call the last action he was trying to do as a auto-logged-out user.
[14:44:21] <duch_kazatel> emx my entire point is to reduce the chance of that happening in the first placd.
[14:44:24] <duch_kazatel> *place
[14:44:45] <emx> duch_kazatel, i see that.
[14:50:23] <duch_kazatel> god damn i hate coldfusion.
[14:50:47] <StephenS> coldfusion?
[14:50:52] <duch_kazatel> the language.
[14:50:56] <nhulea> adobe
[14:51:16] <StephenS> meh
[14:51:20] <StephenS> why do you even use that
[14:51:36] <duch_kazatel> the company is heavily invested in it.
[14:51:37] <duch_kazatel> we'
[14:51:48] <duch_kazatel> *we're looking for something else, but this is what we have for now.
[14:52:10] <duch_kazatel> around 10 years of stuff built with it at this poin.
[15:03:22] <Moridin666> hey guys, what is the purpose of a colon in a line? (total newb here, trying to feel my way along), say for example: tags = typeof(params.tag_check) == 'string' ? [params.tag_check] : params.tag_check;
[15:03:41] <duch_kazatel> That's a ternary operator.
[15:03:45] <duch_kazatel> or a conditional.
[15:03:55] <Moridin666> thank you for the clues
[15:04:01] <Moridin666> i will read further
[15:04:27] <duch_kazatel> that basically sets tags to [params.tag_check] if typeof(params.tag_check) == 'string' is true.  if false, it sets it to params.tag_check
[15:04:32] <duch_kazatel> !mdn conditional
[15:04:34] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Conditional (ternary) Operator - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer ... â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[15:05:11] <Moridin666> thank you very much
[15:08:46] <Automatik> hi
[15:09:01] <duch_kazatel> hello
[15:09:04] <Automatik> how to remove simply the last element of a set of jquery elements?
[15:09:22] <duch_kazatel> check out the :last selector.
[15:10:56] <Automatik> I don't want to select him, I just want to keep the jQuery collection, but without this element
[15:11:35] <duch_kazatel> define "remove"
[15:12:04] <duch_kazatel> there's also filter
[15:13:14] <shoky> .slice(0, -1)
[15:18:57] <Automatik> many thanks :)
[15:41:33] <sunbeam> which function can i best use to monitor when a value of an input field changes?
[15:41:54] <duch_kazatel> .on()
[15:42:01] <duch_kazatel> $('input').on(
[15:42:09] <duch_kazatel> $('input').on('change', function() {});
[15:47:03] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:50:18] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: I need when I type
[15:50:22] <sunbeam> not when i leave field
[15:51:59] <duch_kazatel> check out the keydown and keypress evennts.
[15:52:22] <sunbeam> yep thanks
[15:57:39] <balazs> do you guys know if calling ajax resets some timers ? I am trying to use setInterval, and my function is only called once when using ajax, but works as expected when using just a console.log
[16:02:50] <duch_kazatel> why are you using timers?
[16:07:10] <balazs> duch_kazatel: what do you mean ?
[16:07:22] <balazs> I want to check every 5 seconds if something is done
[16:08:11] <duch_kazatel> if what's done?
[16:08:28] <balazs> I'm doing an api call
[16:08:36] <duch_kazatel> then use the .done() callback of ajax.
[16:08:38] <duch_kazatel> don't use timers.
[16:08:58] <balazs> which creates something, but it takes time for that object to really get created
[16:09:28] <balazs> it's not the ajax call that I'm waiting for to be done...
[16:09:49] <duch_kazatel> then what are you waiting for?
[16:10:52] <duch_kazatel> either way, ajax shouldn't be resetting anything afaik.
[16:11:03] <nhulea> hey anyone got any suggestions for email marketing like mailchimp or something ?
[16:11:12] <balazs> I'm making an API call, which starts a server, but it takes time for the server to start up fully
[16:11:20] <tw2113> why not just go with mailchimp nhulea
[16:11:24] <tw2113> you answered your own question
[16:11:30] <balazs> I need to make sure that the server really is running
[16:11:39] <duch_kazatel> balazs right - so you use .done() and put your logic in there,'
[16:11:45] <nhulea> yeah i guest it just kinda sucks in some spots
[16:12:13] <nhulea> i truly thought it was perfect
[16:12:17] <nhulea> haha
[16:14:12] <balazs> duch_kazatel: I'm doing the setTiemout in "success". Isn't that kind of the same ?
[16:14:32] <duch_kazatel> balazs no.  setTimeout has to do with a timeout for the request.
[16:14:49] <duch_kazatel> you want to run other logic when the request has completed.  that's why you want .done()
[16:15:30] <balazs> Isn't setTimeout just a Javascript timer ? Regardless of Jquery and requests ?
[16:16:28] <duch_kazatel> sorry, I was thinking of timeOut.
[16:16:35] <duch_kazatel> you do not need a timer inside of success/done
[16:16:41] <duch_kazatel> they will only run when the request has completed.
[16:19:39] <balazs> yup. but for some reason setInterval only runs once
[16:23:46] <balazs> seems like it has to with passing data to the function. really odd...
[16:24:35] <duch_kazatel> still dunno why you're running intervals, but ok.
[16:25:57] <balazs> so this works: success: function(res){setInterval(checkifup, 1000)}
[16:26:16] <balazs> this only calls "checkifup" once:  success: function(res){setInterval(checkifup(res), 1000)}
[16:27:41] <balazs> also only once: success: function(res){setInterval(function(r){checkifup(r)}(res), 1000)}
[16:30:37] <duch_kazatel> you don't need the interval in there at all.
[16:31:11] <Atttwww> I'm interested in storing state in the URL to create sharable links, does anyone have any guides or tutorials they know about that go into some of the pitfalls or tips on how best to do that? Like do you MD5 hash strings of varables etc I don't really know?
[16:32:43] <duch_kazatel> Atttwww how much info is it?
[16:33:51] <balazs> duch_kazatel: I do. I need to check if something is one every second. The ajax call that I issue just starts the server, but it returns before it is accepting requests.
[16:34:26] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to rethink your backend strategy to me.
[16:35:52] <balazs> duch_kazatel: come on... checking something periodically is something JS should be able to handle
[16:36:02] <timgauthier> once a second is pretty high
[16:36:15] <timgauthier> might work for one or two visitors, but once your server is getting nailed once a second by a million users...
[16:39:25] <balazs> timgauthier:  it's an intranet site. random users will not be able to stop services...
[16:46:50] <duch_kazatel> balazs that IS something JS can handle, but your backend sounds wonky.
[16:47:01] <duch_kazatel> i've never needed to do anything like that before.
[16:47:06] <balazs> Chrome ? :)
[16:47:29] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:47:41] <balazs> It's javascript running in chrome
[16:47:48] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't change anything.
[16:47:58] <balazs> that's what's wonky
[16:48:31] <duch_kazatel> your backend should be restructured so it returns successfully with the appropriate data.
[16:48:51] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I leave.  enjoy folks.
[18:05:03] <markiii> im having issues in the success part of my ajax request as it always return the data with the alert alert-danger class even if its mensaje or not.. any idea what might be wrong http://jsfiddle.net/rVe67/1/
[18:05:29] <dddh> hi
[18:56:55] <Velveeta> markiii: i'd have to take a look at the response object to be able to tell you what's going wrong
[18:56:58] <danecando> hello
[18:57:31] <danecando> if i get some values by find('element').text(), how can I split them up with a space or comma?
[18:58:00] <Velveeta> danecando: split up their text with a space or comma? or do you mean split up the selectors?
[18:59:26] <danecando> so if i did var foo = $('ul').find('li').text() - it would return the text for each list item
[18:59:44] <danecando> but foo would = item1item2item3
[18:59:58] <danecando> i want to add a space or comma in between them
[19:03:20] <Velveeta> here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/nsVH6/1/
[19:03:36] <Velveeta> you'll need to use a map function and iterate over your collection, then join it on whatever character you want to use
[19:08:58] <danecando> Velveeta thanks for the help man
[19:09:08] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[19:27:21] <sammych> so. I'm trying to spoof an AJAX call made by a library to a server but I'm having no luck in getting it to succeed
[19:28:07] <sammych> it's a JSON type, POST to a server. I've copied all the request payload data, right content type
[19:28:36] <sammych> it looks completely identical to the real request but for some reason it's still rejecting it
[19:28:47] <sammych> is there something I'm missing?
[19:29:01] <sammych> using $.ajax, btw
[19:35:28] <Moult> sammych: need to get an error message to help debug
[19:35:48] <sammych> the server is rejecting it, it's 303'ing it
[19:36:00] <sammych> redirecting to another location with no content
[19:37:37] <Moult> sammych: then perhaps the server checks more than the http method. are you sure all headers are identical? can you replicate with a curl request?
[19:37:50] <sammych> yeah, I'm actually just checking it now
[19:38:01] <sammych> Firebug is giving me more info than Chrome
[19:38:31] <sammych> Chrome doesn't give me the original request in the Network tab, it just replaces the POST with the GET from the 303
[19:38:54] <sammych> I can actually see the different request headers now
[19:46:27] <sammych> ugh, why is it posting as URL encoded...
[19:46:50] <jakesyl> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/having-trouble-understand-jquery-functions#14737000005423777
[19:52:30] <sammych> okay. Honestly, why is it sending as urlencoded when I specifically define the contentType
[19:55:18] <_genuser_> fellow jquery users. I have an app requiring about asynchronous events. is there something in jquery or another framework I should look into?
[19:55:42] <_genuser_> or is long-poll (xhr poll returning when event available) is the best solution still?
[19:55:55] <_genuser_> I am aware there's stuff like comet out there. but I"m curious if there's new solutions.
[20:02:50] <systemfault> samhuntley: processData: false
[20:03:14] <Velveeta> _genuser_: "an app requiring about asynchronous events" ?
[20:03:31] <jakesyl> anyone look at my post
[20:04:04] <Velveeta> jakesyl: your question is about writing a chrome extension...
[20:04:37] <_genuser_> Velveeta: a web based chat for example.
[20:04:54] <Velveeta> _genuser_: what do you mean by "requiring about asynchronous events" ?
[20:04:59] <_genuser_> Velveeta: client is up and running and can be sent a server-side event when there is something ready for it.
[20:05:29] <Velveeta> so you're just wondering if long-polling is the best solution for listening to events from the server?
[20:05:30] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I'm sorry. "requiring asynchronous events". I mistyped a whole unnecessary word in there.
[20:05:43] <_genuser_> Velveeta: correct.
[20:05:55] <Velveeta> that all depends on your support matrix for what browsers you're supporting
[20:06:06] <Velveeta> if you're supporting legacy IE, long-polling is the most reliable
[20:06:15] <Velveeta> if you're only supporting more modern browsers, you can use websockets
[20:06:24] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I think I don't mind say use IE9/10, chrome latest, FF latest, safari latest, etc. Nothing too archaic.
[20:06:30] <Velveeta> you can probably find a library that tries sockets first, and falls back to longpolling where they're not available
[20:07:16] <noober3> can anyone recommend a greate jquery graph plugin?
[20:07:22] <_genuser_> Velveeta: websockets. this will allow the page to open a regular tcp/ip connection, receive asynchronous events, and send asynchronous data, correct?
[20:07:25] <Velveeta> i think socket.io falls back to long polling
[20:07:46] <Velveeta> _genuser_: yes, it keeps a socket open to the server, and uses it for bidirectional communication, no need for polling
[20:08:14] <Velveeta> noober3: i've used jquery flot in the past, it was decent enough.. we use highcharts at the company where i work, but that's not a jquery plugin
[20:08:30] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I remember looking into websockets a while ago. have you used this at all?
[20:08:34] <jakesyl> velveeta the scripts in jquery
[20:08:46] <Velveeta> _genuser_ i haven't personally, no, but i've seen demos of it in action
[20:09:03] <noober3> cool thanks
[20:09:25] <Velveeta> jakesyl: if you can post the script to a jsfiddle demo or something, we might be able to help you out... in the link you posted, i've seen people try to help you, and you just keep saying "no, i already know that, i mean something different" with no clear question as to what you're having difficulty with
[20:09:30] <_genuser_> Velveeta: thanks. I'll go see what it's all about. Let's see what kind of server I would need to implement with this.
[20:09:46] <Velveeta> _genuser_: you can also go check out a demo of firebase
[20:09:53] <_genuser_> Velveeta: with long-polling you can off-load load balancing on the webservers. With websockets, you gotta write real code, lol.
[20:10:00] <_genuser_> firebase? check.
[20:10:03] <Velveeta> it does the actual server-side event signaling though
[20:10:12] <Velveeta> it's not the client-side solution for keeping an open connection
[20:10:18] <Velveeta> but it is built around socket use
[20:10:51] <_genuser_> I think one of the big problems is as a non-web developer, coming into the arena and trying to catch up.
[20:11:25] <jakesyl> Velveeta here's my question, ignore the script how do I find a string in a document in jquery
[20:11:25] <Velveeta> that's definitely a problem... front-end development is a rapidly maturing space, and has exploded over the past 5 years or so
[20:11:33] <_genuser_> but I suppose just a matter of some good long weekend reading and some sample playing.
[20:11:51] <_genuser_> yeah jquery alone is quite nice for me to see in action.
[20:12:32] <Velveeta> jakesyl: you can try the :contains selector.. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[20:12:53] <Velveeta> it's case sensitive though
[20:13:18] <_genuser_> Velveeta: oh firebase, lets you use their front end libs and but host the back end for you, it seems.
[20:13:21] <Velveeta> _genuser_: yeah, jquery itself takes a lot of the headache out of front end work, by normalizing those browser differences
[20:13:35] <jakesyl> i can just to .tolowercase thing right so that should be fine, thanks sorry for bein a bit of an asshole I went from 4 years php to js
[20:14:04] <Velveeta> _genuser_: firebase is a data store with event communication, you can access it from another back end data service of your own, or directly from the client, using any front end framework of your choice, so long as you can wire it up properly
[20:14:47] <_genuser_> Velveeta: however, teh events communicated revolve around data storage, correct? Or can you generate your own events?
[20:15:19] <Velveeta> jakesyl: if you do a toLowerCase(), you'll want to do something like this: $(':has(some text)', $($('body').html().toLowerCase())) ... it looks ugly as hell, but *should* make for a case-insensitive search
[20:15:39] <Velveeta> _genuser_: firebase's events i believe are specifically geared around data storage, typical crud operation events
[20:15:55] <Velveeta> if you wanted custom events, you'd have to figure out what defined those, listen for those on the client, and then retrigger as your custom events
[20:16:13] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I see. technical you can use crud to just add new rows of data (event info) and push it out, I suppose.
[20:16:15] <Velveeta> if you have specific server-side events that aren't based around storage, then you'd have to just trigger those directly from the server
[20:16:39] <Velveeta> yeah, you could do that i suppose, but i probably wouldn't use a table just as a message queue like that
[20:17:02] <Velveeta> if you're gonna go the route of using sockets for client/server event transmissions, i'd just transmit directly from the server to the client when something happened
[20:17:20] <Velveeta> firebase is specifically for monitoring changes in persistently stored data models
[20:17:36] <Velveeta> things like realtime comment streams on say, a youtube video
[20:17:50] <_genuser_> Velveeta: my old school idea was to write a server that listen to the events and saves them in a message queue (microsoft message queue in this case). And a c#.net/php message delivery that pulls them off the queue. Client can use html5's EventSource crap....
[20:18:03] <Velveeta> someone posts a new comment, it gets pushed to the server, updates the data store, and it alerts all other clients that the model has been updated, so they can update their own UI in respnose
[20:18:32] <Velveeta> well, if you're gonna publish them as a queue anyway, then yeah, firebase would work for something like that
[20:18:50] <jakesyl> Velveeta one more thing, besides the eh... codeacademy tutorial you know of any decent jquery tutorials that deal more with nodes and childs
[20:19:03] <Velveeta> you could just have your client subscribe to that specific collection (the event queue), and have your server publish to it as it needed, and firebase would alert your clients to new messages
[20:19:15] <_genuser_> Velveeta: right, my actual application is going to receive events in a queue.
[20:19:42] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I think next step to read the darn docs. The Getting started didn't help me get clarification. Maybe I'll write a few samples.
[20:19:54] <Velveeta> jakesyl: well, if you're using jquery, you should use its dom traversal functions also, that's part of the beauty of jquery is that it simplifies that interface for you so you can just do things like .parent().children().first().next().next().prev() etc to move around in the dom tree
[20:20:22] <Velveeta> if you're gonna use references to things like .childNodes and .nextSibling, you might as well skip using jquery and just write it in vanilla js
[20:21:04] <Velveeta> unless i'm missing what you're actually shooting at with that question
[20:21:34] <Velveeta> _genuser_: you can try watching the firebase demo from the angular conference a few months ago also, they put on a decent video demonstration of it in action in what they call 3-way data binding
[20:21:50] <Velveeta> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4yUTkva_FM
[20:22:14] <_genuser_> Velveeta: lol, in tech you can never sit back and chill.
[20:22:20] <_genuser_> not unless you're a professor.
[20:22:20] <Velveeta> you sure can't
[20:22:31] <Velveeta> and even then, you'd better be doing some continuing education :)
[20:22:51] <_genuser_> if you're a professor, then it's ok. Most of my graduate level books were written by people who got their PhD's in the 80s.
[20:22:56] <_genuser_> and have just been teaching since then.
[20:23:19] <_genuser_> and you write a book about software architecture? seriously? once of them said he had experience working with the eclipse software foundation.
[20:23:19] <Velveeta> but in what courses?
[20:23:30] <Velveeta> some topics have much longer shelf lives than others ;)
[20:23:34] <_genuser_> It was Software Architecture.
[20:24:05] <Velveeta> software architecture doesn't have too many revolutionary breakthroughs that deprecate old knowledge though, i could see that staying relevant for a couple decades
[20:24:15] <_genuser_> these guys up to chapter 3 were still saying in America buildings are build with one structure in mind. In the north they need to be able to handle more snow weight. In the south not so much.
[20:24:19] <_genuser_> they kept using this example.
[20:24:25] <Velveeta> but if you're teaching specific language course or something, or emerging technologies, you'd definitely have to stay fresh
[20:24:33] <_genuser_> and then they gave examples of software architecture.
[20:24:40] <Velveeta> heheheh
[20:24:43] <_genuser_> client/server, object-oriented, etc.
[20:24:51] <Velveeta> well, i live in the south, so my code is written mostly to withstand the heat
[20:25:05] <_genuser_> they seriously said that "object-oriented" is A software architecture.
[20:25:29] <monk12_home> hey all, just thought I'd ask... Anyone know if Safari blocks 3rd party cookies overall by default... or only in iframes?
[20:25:36] <_genuser_> in other words, you're brain washign studnets that if they're pick client/server software architecture, they don't need to pay attention to object oriented approaches.
[20:25:51] <Velveeta> i could see that, when you go about figuring out how to construct a program, you can write it in a functional language, an OO language, or a procedural scripting language
[20:26:00] <Velveeta> but that's really the most basic decision in SA
[20:26:04] <monk12_home> I see many places claiming they have a policy where it blocks 3rd party cookies by default (but not sure if that only applied to iframed sites)
[20:26:22] <Velveeta> from there you then have to start scaling up to what patterns to put into place, and then distributed architectures for network services, etc
[20:26:23] <_genuser_> I expected some thought about software architecture. What are main concerns. What are the pitfalls. What's the best approach.
[20:26:34] <Velveeta> right
[20:26:56] <Velveeta> monk12_home: no clue, i've never really paid attention to that
[20:26:57] <_genuser_> having coded professionally for 15years, I went in there to read things like object oriented is a software architecture. Client/server is software architecture.
[20:27:23] <_genuser_> client/server is architecture in a way, but also it's mostly a requiremnet of the application.
[20:27:31] <Velveeta> yeah i would consider client/server more of a network topology that determines *how* your code is architected, vs a software architecture itself
[20:28:02] <_genuser_> yeah, you're right. I'd think of it as application architecture. not software architecture.
[20:28:22] <monk12_home> Velveeta:  Darn k. yeh i def know my iframed website gets its cookies blocked, so the session therefore gets killed too hehe... Have to use a hack where I redirect to the cross-domained site, set a cookie, then redirect back to original website... then Safari allows cookies (since they have been prev set on prev visited domain). funky hack heh.
[20:28:43] <Velveeta> right, when i think software architecture, i think of what kinds of modules are gonna be involved, how they'll communicate, any specific subscription patterns i want to put into place, etc
[20:29:16] <_genuser_> and not to forget, how to best approach this in a corporate environment.
[20:29:22] <Velveeta> monk12_home: weird, but i don't typically work in iframes, so that would explain why i've never come across that quirk before :)
[20:29:41] <_genuser_> because most students will go out and code for a guy paying them a paycheck. he doens't care about correct architecture. he just cares about timelines.
[20:29:48] <Velveeta> right
[20:29:57] <Velveeta> that's an ongoing battle
[20:30:08] <_genuser_> so you need to equip students with knowledge on that.
[20:30:26] <Velveeta> Cheap, Fast, Quality: Choose 2... somehow, quality always loses that battle
[20:30:31] <_genuser_> http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Foundations-Theory-Practice/dp/0470167742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404185411&sr=8-1&keywords=Software+Architecture%3A+Foundations%2C+Theory%2C+and+Practice
[20:30:39] <_genuser_> that's the book. I was disappointed by the 3 authors.
[20:31:12] <_genuser_> besides, you need to have software development experience to teach this topic.
[20:31:17] <Velveeta> you should ask your professor if punch card a software architecture :D
[20:31:26] <Velveeta> *is* a SA
[20:31:43] <_genuser_> lol.
[20:31:47] <_genuser_> in the corproate world anybody with 5 years of experience is jr-mid level engineer.
[20:32:12] <_genuser_> somebody with 10 is a sr. level engineer. And here we have 3 authors who never worked in the corporate world. And are teaching.
[20:32:30] <Velveeta> those who can't do.. teach?
[20:32:44] <_genuser_> and my professor had graduate from teh college with a M.Sc, then on to PhD and become a professor. Where is your experience.
[20:33:03] <Velveeta> it's all theoretical, unfortunately
[20:33:29] <Velveeta> one of my favorite quotes is "in theory, practice and theory should always be the same, but in practice, they rarely are"
[20:33:34] <_genuser_> I also a Software Testing, Quality Assurance class. Which I thought would teach me some buzzwords at least to then research for how to test my teams products that we authored/manage
[20:33:42] <_genuser_> love that quote.
[20:34:23] <_genuser_> My s/w testing class professor was someone with 5yrs experience and huge grants to test.... wait for it..... web applications.
[20:34:46] <_genuser_> Do you want to know what he taught on how to test web applciations?
[20:34:52] <Velveeta> i'm still trying to get deeper into client-side testing
[20:35:05] <Velveeta> i hope it wasn't just selenium
[20:35:36] <_genuser_> He was analyzing apache logs and saying thigns like 20% of the request are gif, 10% - jpg, 70% htmls files. 5% unfound files.
[20:35:49] <Fall> :o
[20:35:55] <_genuser_> we have to fix those links in those html pages so they don't send students to broken links.
[20:36:08] <Velveeta> aye yai yai
[20:36:10] <_genuser_> how it a static website (HTML only) even a web applciation????
[20:36:18] <systemfault> _genuser_: Sorry, about that bookâ€¦ is it worth a read at all? (Iâ€™m always looking for software architecture books)
[20:36:39] <_genuser_> and how are you collecting metrics and calling is software testing when you have performed _NO_ user interface testing. Input handling, error handling, server side handling, etc.
[20:36:51] <_genuser_> systemfault: I didn't find it to be useful at all.
[20:36:58] <systemfault> Ah, sadâ€¦
[20:37:06] <systemfault> _genuser_: You read the blue book?
[20:37:14] <_genuser_> systemfault: blue book?
[20:37:21] <_genuser_> kelley's blue book or auto prices???
[20:37:31] <systemfault> _genuser_: Domain-Driven Design
[20:37:36] <Velveeta> systemfault: one of our principle architects had a software architecture book he was hyping a while back, i'll see if i can dig up the title
[20:37:36] <systemfault> by Eric Evans
[20:37:51] <_genuser_> systemfault: no I have. I haven't much faith in books and career preachers.
[20:38:22] <_genuser_> like martin fowler. they re-use existing design patterns, label them something scandalous (e.g. Inappropriate Contact design pattern) and sell a new book.
[20:38:38] <_genuser_> s/no I have/no I haven't/
[20:38:39] <systemfault> I usually sceptical tooâ€¦ but at the same time, Iâ€™m not a geniusâ€¦ so I read what others have done.
[20:39:08] <systemfault> _genuser_: I only bought PoEAA from Fowler
[20:39:13] <_genuser_> I am learning more from online articles and finding developers who have something great to teach. And reading their blogs and articles.
[20:39:16] <systemfault> Worth a read IMHO
[20:39:44] <systemfault> _genuser_: I found the same from blogsâ€¦ most of bad but some of them are real gems.
[20:39:51] <systemfault> *most of them are bad
[20:40:04] <_genuser_> fowler can make you believe a book was a good investment. maybe it was. but he puts tons of design patterns in there. A studnets who doesn't know what they can really do won't benefit
[20:40:41] <_genuser_> I think design patterns really help if they're introduced to a student slowly based on the student's knowledge level.
[20:40:57] <_genuser_> So s/he can actually use what they learn as they start writing more and more complex code.
[20:41:32] <Velveeta> i've become a huge fan of design patterns and knowing when to use them, but that's after years of development experience
[20:41:43] <_genuser_> Velveeta: watchign the video now.
[20:41:45] <Velveeta> systemfault: here was one link our guy shared at work: http://manohars.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/97-things-every-software-architect-should-know.pdf
[20:42:14] <Velveeta> he also highly recommended this book as a must-read, but it's .net specific: http://www.amazon.com/Dependency-Injection-NET-Mark-Seemann/dp/1935182501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398871382&sr=8-1&keywords=dependency+injection+in+.net
[20:42:34] <systemfault> Velveeta: Will read it
[20:42:41] <_genuser_> Velveeta: people I generally discuss this with get angry when I say you should learn them as you code more and get to a point where you need a pattern.
[20:43:11] <systemfault> Weirdâ€¦ I know Mark Seeman for other books.
[20:43:25] <Velveeta> _genuser_: right, the real aha moments come when you've previously solved a problem (many times, in multiple ways) that a specific design pattern is perfectly suited for, and you realize "ohhhh why didn't i do it that way, it's so obvious now!"
[20:43:31] <codepython777> var foundin = $('*:contains(qstring)'); - how do i write this correctly?
[20:44:01] <systemfault> Ahhh right, Mark Seemann is a DDD/CQRS/ES guy
[20:44:07] <Velveeta> codepython777: you can probably omit the *... is qstring the literal text you're looking for?
[20:44:17] <codepython777> Velveeta: I've a bunch of <section  id="xxx"> ... and i am looking to find xxx which contains the query string.
[20:44:36] <_genuser_> Velveeta: wow, you, sir, are very much right on the money. I have been saying it for a long time. You need to hit that problem, solve it, then investigate a design pattern.
[20:44:43] <codepython777> Velveeta: yes, for now i'm just looking for an exact match
[20:44:47] <Velveeta> but is "qstring" the literal text, or is it a variable?
[20:44:49] <_genuser_> Velveeta: that way you know exactly why a design pattern works.
[20:45:15] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I had a colleague force her way to write MVC for writing an object for me that fetched data from back end.
[20:45:19] <Velveeta> _genuser_: rightio.. otherwise it's all just theory that you're reading through without any valid context to apply it to retroactively
[20:45:35] <codepython777> Velveeta: variable
[20:45:59] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I argued with her (and I lost my temper a bit, and felt bad for being unprofessional) but she just kept saying, "you're stupid."
[20:46:00] <Velveeta> codepython777: the :contains() selector looks for literal text, so try something like this: $(':contains(' + qstring + ')')
[20:46:31] <codepython777> thx
[20:46:31] <_genuser_> Velveeta: then she gave me a simple object that a) initialized itself from a config, instead of properties so I could set it up programmatically
[20:46:49] <_genuser_> Velveeta: b) had the code in 3 folders - (./Model, ./View, ./Controller)
[20:46:57] <codepython777> v
[20:47:14] <_genuser_> Velveeta: c) and had more than one file just to read some basic phonebook data from a backend db.
[20:47:14] <Velveeta> codepython777: did that work as expected?
[20:47:21] <codepython777> Velveeta: How do i search for inside section id="xxx"? Trying now
[20:47:50] <Velveeta> codepython777: if you want to limit the scope to just those, you'd do something like this: $('section[id]:contains(' + qstring + ')')
[20:48:32] <codepython777> Velveeta: thanks. Lemme try
[20:48:52] <Velveeta> if you want to scope it to a *specific* section id, you'd do $('#xxx:contains(' + qstring + ')') and it'll only return that section if it actually does contain that text, otherwise, it'll just return an empty collection
[20:49:10] <Velveeta> the $('section[id]') selector will scope it to all sections that have an id attribute of any value
[20:49:34] <codepython777> Velveeta: var foundin = $(':contains(' + qstring + ')');    alert("Found in : " + foundin);    console.log(foundin);  I see the alert, but cant see any logs output to inspect the object.
[20:50:18] <Velveeta> _genuser_: i thought MVC was overblown for the client when i first started encountering those offerings, like javascriptmvc, etc... then i came to realize that mvc isn't so much about being feature rich as it is about code organization for thick-client apps
[20:50:22] <codepython777> I do get an alert that says Found in: [Object object]
[20:51:06] <Velveeta> codepython777: can you put together a sample demo on jsfiddle or something? just some sample markup and a qstring you're looking for with that code snippet
[20:51:16] <Velveeta> i'll see if i can spot anything obvious that might be screwing it up
[20:51:41] <Velveeta> _genuser_: i've since started moving closer and closer to the MVVM camp of offerings, but i still think angular bastardizes its implementation
[20:51:48] <codepython777> Velveeta: I am new to this, and am sure doing something silly. Give me a few minutes. I'll get a site for you.
[20:51:52] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I used it with great success in ASP 3.0 / PHP where the controller goes like index.php?cmd=blah, and loads the correct view, and  data strucutres retrieve and hold the model.
[20:52:01] <Velveeta> i like addy osmani's example of MVVM with loose data bindings <fetching link>
[20:52:08] <sammych> btw, thanks systemfault
[20:52:10] <_genuser_> Velveeta: now Microsoft has MVC 2.0, MVC 3.0, etc. Each year just to sell their new visual studio.
[20:52:13] <sammych> got it all working now
[20:52:41] <_genuser_> Velveeta: and kids are asking me do you know MVC 3.0? Heck no, kid! it's all just MVC depending on what helpers microsoft has written for it this year.
[20:53:57] <_genuser_> Velveeta: this firebase guy has no sense of logic. He just jumps from logic to assumption in the intro. let's see how the coding session gos.
[20:54:02] <systemfault> sammych: :)
[20:54:13] <Velveeta> _genuser_: here's his example of MVVM w/ looser data bindings (you'll have to scroll down a little from this link): http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvvm
[20:54:38] <_genuser_> Velveeta: checking it out now.
[20:54:48] <Velveeta> although if you're not familiar w/ the way angular does its voodoo, then this probably won't jump out as a cleaner solution
[20:56:15] <_genuser_> Velveeta: declarative security access. Freaking aye!!
[20:56:43] <_genuser_> Velveeta: so far, the video is promising stuff it better deliver!!
[20:57:06] <Velveeta> yeah, if i remember correctly, security is configuration driven within the document branches themselves
[20:57:57] <_genuser_> Velveeta: I like this description of MVVM. I'll ahve to read it more carefully once I finish this video of firebase.
[20:58:17] <codepython777> Velveeta: var fout = $("section[id]:contains('" + qs + "')"); - was missing a ' / "
[20:58:23] <_genuser_> Velveeta: now, my only concern is if the firebase URL they the "Getting Started" section mentioned HAS to be on their domain.
[20:58:38] <Velveeta> yeah, i like the idea of data classes being used for behavioral and model bindings, similar to css classes being used for presentational bindings
[20:58:57] <Velveeta> i believe firebase does have to host the firebase data store, yes
[20:59:21] <Velveeta> codepython777: so you got it working?
[20:59:38] <_genuser_> I'm trying to port our solution to the "web" to be webonly. And wonder if my boss will go for it.
[21:00:23] <_genuser_> mainly because when we sell it to our customer, they want "absolute" control over where they data is at all times. Mostly they want it to be encrypted during transmission and not stored at all, or stored as encrypted.
[21:00:40] <Velveeta> just convince him to let you construct a nice robust server-side API that any number of clients can access, and sell it as SaaS :D
[21:00:59] <Velveeta> and then from the client perspective, you can build a web app to consume it, or something on a mobile platform just as easily
[21:01:10] <_genuser_> Velveeta: well, hence my original question . :)
[21:01:16] <Velveeta> or other services that mash up your data to sell as their own dashboards
[21:01:50] <Velveeta> well i wouldn't advocate for not stored at all, but they could easily just store it on an encrypted drive
[21:02:20] <_genuser_> I was thinking if I can aggregate all teh data, process it thru my state management framework and always store the latest state of the client into a DB, I can then worry about pushing it out asynchronously.
[21:03:01] <_genuser_> alternatively, I can store all teh events into a message queue and push them all out asynchronously. And then teh client can go thru state management logic in javascript client side.
[21:03:10] <Velveeta> so that's why you have an event queue? for alerting the state of a processingq ueue?
[21:03:32] <_genuser_> queue, only if all the events are to be delivered to the client to be parsed by it.
[21:03:40] <Velveeta> gotcha
[21:04:05] <_genuser_> otherwise, each clients gets a "status" row in a DB and a ping script (.php) will just return when the data changes.
[21:04:32] <Velveeta> right
[21:04:43] <_genuser_> Velveeta: we've implemented a .NET control to be embedded in the browser before. And people hated that.
[21:04:58] <Velveeta> i can't stand .net web controls myself :D
[21:05:03] <_genuser_> .NET policies had to be set to allow it to open tcp/ip connections out. To access local disk, etc.
[21:05:22] <Velveeta> anytime i come across a damn select element with a runat="server" attribute, i rewrite that shit on the spot :D
[21:05:23] <_genuser_> and the UI was like a windows app stuck inside a web page - borderless, lol.
[21:05:56] <_genuser_> yeah select only need runat=server if you need to handle item change event.
[21:06:47] <_genuser_> .NET was a step forward, but it's quite kludgy in it's implementation of everything. All the JS wireups. The extra libs to just use AJAX.
[21:06:52] <Velveeta> even then, that shouldn't be done with .net's auto-magic crap, handle that with some proper js and an endpoint designated for it :D
[21:07:01] <Velveeta> right
[21:07:32] <_genuser_> that's why I say it's kludgy. because then you're implementing cleaner JS stuff yourself half the time and letting .NET do it it's own way the rest
[21:07:49] <Velveeta> and i like having as much of a separation between back and front end as possible, preferably no server-generated js, no consumable html, etc... the client handles its requests, the server handles the responses, and always in json
[21:08:30] <_genuser_> another thing about .NET that they haven't implemented native JSON support so far. (visual studio 2010)
[21:08:54] <_genuser_> I know 2012 has been out for a while but it was too much of a processor hog on my 4core, 2.6GHz 4Gig-RAM machine.
[21:09:07] <_genuser_> and even that might not have support for JSOn natively.
[21:09:39] <Velveeta> yeah, most of our devs work on macs, but our back end guys do a lot of c#, so they either bootcamp their machines, or run windows VM's.... needless to say, we're all rocking 16 gigs of ram :D
[21:10:05] <Velveeta> and sometimes, those VM's are still hogging more than they should for what they're doing
[21:10:38] <Velveeta> that's another reason i like that clean separation of back and front end.. as a front end dev, i can use a much more lightweight editor like sublime, rather than having to open VS just to muck with JS
[21:10:40] <_genuser_> Velveeta: my machine just now became able to handle more than 8Gig. Last mobo was 4Gig DDR2. And buying another DDR2 is expensive.
[21:11:16] <_genuser_> the new mobo is running 8G one module, one slot. So I can jack it upto 32G.
[21:11:43] <_genuser_> but as soon as they make a tablet that cost less than 1000 and have 16G rams... chucking all desktops and laptops, lol.
[21:12:43] <Velveeta> i still don't see myself doing real work on a tablet for a good while yet... to me, they're just e-readers and touchscreen games :D
[21:12:56] <Velveeta> but i remember when i thought the same thing about laptops vs desktops
[21:13:28] <Velveeta> w/ tablets though, it's more of a screen real estate and interaction thing... and you can hook them up to external keyboards, and probably to monitors too, but then why not just use a laptop :D
[21:14:02] <_genuser_> Velveeta: 4Gig RAM, 128G Hard Disk, Windows 8 Pro tablet: Microsoft Surface Pro. It can replace a medium side laptop
[21:14:35] <_genuser_> Velveeta: so bluetooth keyboard/mouse and HDMI out for 1920x1080 external monitor can make it a nice little desktop.
[21:15:07] <_genuser_> for us windows users it can essentially be a one little gadget doing all the fun stuff. Undock and off you go.
[21:15:14] <Velveeta> right, but then you have to also carry a keyboard and monitor around with you if you want that on the go, might as well just use a laptop ;)
[21:15:37] <_genuser_> Velveeta: yes, if you'll work remotely all the time, true that.
[21:16:01] <Velveeta> i don't all the time, but i do a good amount :)
[21:16:15] <_genuser_> Velveeta: but for me, it's one of those, if I travel, I can take it with me along with a small bluetooh keyboard with a touchpad. At home, I can unplug and sit on teh couch for e-reader. And dock back for real work.
[21:16:42] <Velveeta> and when i get to work, i have a couple of monitors and an old microsoft keyboard i can plug right into... i like the bigger clickity clack of those keys more than these little dinky keypads :D
[21:17:00] <_genuser_> Yeah, I read about people running dual monitor setup on those.
[21:17:03] <Velveeta> my home row is almost blank at this point, and the little nub on the j key is damn near worn smooth
[21:17:21] <_genuser_> so I thought a surface, dual monitor, real full size keyboard and full size mouse all powered by a tablet.
[21:18:07] <_genuser_> I would miss playing games on it. But hopefully they'll get strong enough soon. In the meantime I can just use it to replace my laptop.
[21:19:29] <Velveeta> right
[21:19:37] <Velveeta> here's my command station at work :D http://i.imgur.com/52Px2oJ.jpg
[21:20:28] <_genuser_> very nice. what are those? more than 24" monitors?
[21:20:55] <Velveeta> i think they're 27's, if i remember right
[21:21:09] <_genuser_> yeah mine are 23" and fell small now and then, lol.
[21:21:20] <_genuser_> but I can't figure out how people work on single monitor.
[21:21:48] <Velveeta> i remember the first time i got used to dual monitors, i wondered how i could ever go back to one :D
[21:22:25] <_genuser_> I can't alt-tab back and forth between workspace and reference material.
[21:22:28] <_genuser_> side-by-side!!
[21:22:46] <Velveeta> heheheh
[22:19:43] <axscode> hi guys i have this as event e . e.target.parentElement.parentElement  how is it possible to do .animate() or .hide() in this target element?  i can use .remove() but other function it says unidentified function.
[22:43:16] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:56:50] <rhizome> i'm submitting a form via ajax with a datatype of json and i'm getting a parsererror. how can i examine the returned data? i can't find it in xhr/evt/status objects
[23:00:02] <wa5ted> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIgZ7gMze7A
[23:00:06] <wa5ted> gurke_: ^
[23:00:09] <wa5ted> XD
[23:17:29] <Cork> rhizome: .fail(function(xhr, status) { console.log(xhr.responseText); });
[23:17:42] <Cork> rhizome: or simplest is prob to inspect it in the browser console
[23:25:08] <ssut> hello to all
[23:28:02] <ssut> can i get help qunit in this channel?
[23:44:04] <soee> hi, i have an issue with settings hidden field value, i have separate function where value is calculated, if i log it into conosle i have the valid value, than if i try to assign it to hidden field it doesn't set
[23:44:11] <soee> any hints ?
[23:44:54] <Cork> ?paste
[23:44:55] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:52:21] <sledgeDJ> anyone here able to help me with an SQL issue?
[23:52:45] <gurke_> sledgeDJ, try to ask in #mysql
[23:54:30] <wa5ted> ?paste soee
[23:54:41] <wa5ted> soee: ?paste
[23:55:02] <soee> 2 minutes please :)
[23:55:07] <wa5ted> sledgeDJ: lets hear it since im curious
[23:55:15] <wa5ted> soee: im just trying out commands
[23:55:18] <wa5ted> XD
[23:55:29] <sledgeDJ> http://pastie.org/9342540
[23:55:36] <sledgeDJ> that is my SQL query and some output
[23:55:53] <wa5ted> okay and the issue
[23:56:07] <sledgeDJ> i want to be able to total the QTY feild per ItemID
[23:56:22] <sledgeDJ> so itemID 477 had a total of 8qty
[23:56:45] <sledgeDJ> so it lists only each item ID once and its total
[23:56:51] <sledgeDJ> make sense?
[23:58:45] <VectorX> hi, how can i get the bottom array from the top array http://jsfiddle.net/w3QY8/1/ basically moving "manager" to where "regions" is
