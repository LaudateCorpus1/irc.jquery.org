[11:20:34] <Uhkis> is this really the only channel who isn't spammin liberachat? :D
[11:40:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:42:09] <pavonia> #jQuery -- the last stronghold
[11:52:01] <decx> why aren't you moving anyway
[12:01:02] <robertmaxrees> decx the channel just isn't a priority to the greater foundation.  i asked about migrating and the response i got was that 1: they had no clue what was happening on freenode, and 2: that not very many people use the channel as-is.
[12:01:26] <decx> yeah figured
[12:03:04] <decx> personally i just moved because the old irc ops have done a good job over the years and was waiting to figure out what exactly was going on, but now with the whole channel takeovers it's getting weird
[12:04:27] <Uhkis> i wonder if we need the full url to get taken over
[12:04:59] <Uhkis> at least someone claimed they're actually using some scripts to take over the channels
[12:35:04] <Robdgreat> sounds like it's a thing with promoting migration to a new venue in the topic
[12:35:20] <robertmaxrees> https://lwn.net/Articles/857252/ it's this.
[12:37:11] <Robdgreat> it's selective freenode policy enforcement
[12:38:19] <robertmaxrees> there was a global notice that noted some channels were accidnetally included.
[12:38:32] <Robdgreat> Everyone's speeding but only the red cars are getting tickets
[22:00:21] <WillPittenger> I'm creating a GreaseMonkey script to run in Firefox.  $("*") is returning only sandbox elements.  What's going on?
[23:00:12] <karbassi> WillPittenger can you share a snippet of the code so we can debug it?
[23:01:02] <karbassi> Also, don't paste code in here directly. Paste it in jsbin.com jsfiddle.net etc
[23:02:31] <WillPittenger> I don't have it anymore.  I gave up on it and tried to step through the page with the DOM.  The idea was to look at elements in google.com pages and try to force them to use Times New Roman.  I wanted to do that with Stylus, but Google keeps changing the selectors.
[23:47:56] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger just use a custom stylesheet for that instead of js.
[23:48:17] <WillPittenger> Like I said, they keep changing the selectors.
[23:48:45] <robertmaxrees> * is a valid css selector :)
[23:49:06] <robertmaxrees> ah having issues with specificity i'm guessing?
[23:49:51] <WillPittenger> robertmaxrees: My Stylus stylesheet uses their selectors, but they keep changing those.
[23:50:28] <robertmaxrees> iirc stuff like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/font-changer/obgkjikcnonokgaiablbenkgjcdbknna?hl=en also exists depending.
[23:51:28] <WillPittenger> Browser is Firefox.
[23:51:40] <robertmaxrees> should have similar options for that :)
