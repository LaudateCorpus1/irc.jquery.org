[01:45:22] <Mark_____> im trying to create a slider that adjusts the height of a specific div element. but somehow it doesnâ€™t seem to work. https://jsfiddle.net/drekrnLg/ can anyone help me out?
[02:53:00] <BlueShark> How can I swap the innertext of a td on click? There are two texts, and onclick I need to toggle between them.
[02:54:36] <BlueShark> Put one in display: none; and then use toggleClass - or are there any better solutions?

[06:41:04] <arc_> oh, it gives a 404 period
[06:41:55] <dolomighty> arc_: but it isn't still a json response? why doesn't it stringify it and show it in the alert window?
[06:42:11] <arc_> i would guess it's a fail response
[06:42:27] <arc_> but i've never used json before
[06:42:37] <arc_> try putting something in the fail response

[08:00:45] <Narhir> Hi
[08:00:52] <Narhir> I have created accordion but it is animating badly
[08:00:54] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/vmt2dd9p/
[08:01:14] <Narhir> the "tier box" is moving kind of OK
[08:01:19] <Narhir> But the "TEXT" just JUMPS OUT
[08:01:23] <Narhir> instead of like.. you know
[08:01:28] <Narhir> showing from behind the box
[08:01:30] <Narhir> if that makes sense
[09:59:29] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:44:11] <arup_r> Hi, When I am experimenting this .toggleClass( className, state ) ( http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/#toggleClass-className-state ).. I have the same usecase.. I am just trying to make sure, if `$('.myDiv').toggleClass('otherClass', true);` is executed more than once, say 3 times, will the same class will be added there also 3 times or not. I have verified it will not duplicate https://jsfiddle.net/2v4wwnra/5/ .. But still want to get verify i
[10:44:11] <arup_r> f I am on the correct path or not.. :) Can you review my little tiny code and confirm please
[10:49:38] <rindolf> arup_r: hi.
[10:49:49] <arup_r> Hello rindolf
[10:51:18] <rindolf> arup_r: what won't "duplicate"?
[10:51:34] <rindolf> arup_r: a class cannot be added more than once.
[10:51:37] <arup_r> adding of the class `otherClass`
[10:51:52] <arup_r> humm.. rindolf that is answer I was looking for..
[10:52:01] <rindolf> arup_r: nicec.
[10:52:05] <rindolf> arup_r: you're welcome .
[10:52:26] <arup_r> thanks rindolf .. I tested in fiddle .. and saw it was not getting added more than once.. but still wanted to confirm..
[10:54:08] <rindolf> arup_r: sure.

[12:14:54] <PCatinean> Hey guys, does anyone know a good plugin that allows drag and drop of images that can generate html taking the z-index into account?
[12:15:08] <ThePendulum> Bit of a cross-country question this, but maybe someone here is more experienced. I'm using $.ajax to retrieve data from an API on another domain. This API returns a set-cookie header, which is then set to the domain of the API in my browser. I would like to set this to the domain of the application requesting the API, not the API itself. crossDomain and withCredentials don't seem to have any effect
[12:16:15] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure whether to look for the issue with nginx or with jquery; the actual header is part of the response and is being set, just not to the right domain
[12:16:48] <ThePendulum> *the cookie is being set
[12:18:43] <ThePendulum> I'm reading mixed comments on whether it's possible at all
[12:20:09] <ThePendulum> Guess I should take this issue to the API server and get it to send me the session ID in the body so I can then set it locally
[12:35:50] <rindolf> ThePendulum: good luck - sorry I cannot help.
[12:36:39] <ThePendulum> rindolf: I must be doing something fundamentally wrong as I feel this should be a much more prominent issue :P
[12:36:45] <ThePendulum> but I'll figure it out, cheers :)
[12:37:12] <rindolf> ThePendulum: sure.

[17:11:09] <comrade_> hi
[17:11:34] <Demonen> o/
[17:11:56] <comrade_> i have a question
[17:12:02] <comrade_> can some1 help me?
[17:12:04] <Demonen> Not unexpected.
[17:12:16] <Demonen> It's much easier to help you if you just ask your question.
[17:13:19] <comrade_> i'm new in web development, just finished php,mysql,css,html5 want to begin javascript/jquery/ajax ... but I know it's not enough, what else do I need to know in order to improve my skills
[17:14:00] <Demonen> That sounds like enough to me.
[17:14:22] <Demonen> What do you want to do that you can't do with those?
[17:14:40] <Demonen> I mean, I'm no great fan of PHP, but it's clearly useful for a lot of people.
[17:15:22] <metrixx> comrade_, practice.
[17:15:26] <comrade_> I feel like I missed something, like I'm learning not enough
[17:16:29] <comrade_> is Python great btw?
[17:16:31] <metrixx> comrade_, reading and watching and studying is not enough for learning. you should practice like i do right now :)
[17:16:44] <Demonen> Yeah, I agree with metrixx.
[17:16:57] <Demonen> Make up something you want to create, then create it.
[17:17:20] <comrade_> metrixx, I love studying..that's why I cannot stop doing that :>
[17:17:34] <comrade_> I started with C# but didn't like it so moved to web development and Java
[17:18:05] <metrixx> comrade_, then go to university and be a prof. read articles forever
[17:18:22] <comrade_> but I wanted to ask people LIVE, people knowing Python. What can you create with Python ?
[17:18:54] <metrixx> comrade_, language is just a tool. first decide what you want to do
[17:19:44] <comrade_> oh, i want to stick with web development & android development but I was just curious about Python
[17:19:57] <comrade_> btw any advice for a new programmer that's about to step into your world? :)
[17:20:17] <metrixx> turn back and run away
[17:20:18] <Demonen> Follow what you think is fun.
[17:20:47] <Demonen> It's not worth the money to have the life sucked out of you doing spreadsheets and financial projections.
[17:20:54] <Demonen> Well, unless you think that's fun.
[17:22:27] <comrade_> are there any specific blogs to read or youtube channels to follow, I want to stay tuned...read all the news and stuff
[17:22:30] <comrade_> what do you guys read?
[17:22:45] <Demonen> Text, mostly.
[17:22:53] <metrixx> comrade_, ask in quora. i saw a lot of questions like these there
[17:25:05] <compact> hi guys. I'm using jquery datatbles on my magento store. now I'm looking at lazy loading or defer rendering, however building the datatbles search class into magneto will be a nightmare
[17:25:06] <compact> any suggestions how i can overcome this
[17:26:23] <Demonen> I'd cache that stuff serverside and leave jQuery out of it.
[17:26:42] <compact> its very dynamic data
[17:28:11] <compact> so cache the page every 5 minutes or something?
[17:28:41] <compact> could get messy, and there a ton of different data to show for each client
[19:22:23] <Twirl> hey guys, i have my data from ajax it's a bunch of <img> element's, using $.ajax, can i do something like data.forEach(myFunc)?
[19:25:43] <Twirl> data.length shows the amount of characters so i guess it's not grabbin it as html.. ?
[19:30:36] <Twirl> I need the elements fetched to pass to another script, .load won't work
[19:32:37] <shoky_> Twirl: if it's an html snippet you can do  $(data) to get the browser to parse it into a DOM element(s), and get a jquery object wrapping it
[19:33:09] <Twirl> yea nvm, i'm doing it like imgs = $.parseHTML(data);
[19:33:13] <shoky_> or sometimes you might need $($.parseHTML(data))
[19:33:16] <shoky_> ya
[19:33:47] <shoky_> for simple html snippets just doing $(data) is usually fine
[19:38:16] <Twirl> shoky_: i'm having trouble handling the content's of data as elements, it's a bunch of <img...> yet console.log($($.parseHTML(data)).find('img').length); shows 0
[19:40:26] <Twirl> any idea why?
[19:41:03] <Twirl> console.log($(data).find('img').length); same
[19:43:12] <Twirl> shoky_: ?
[19:47:55] <Twirl> hey man, anyone knows what could be the issue here?
[19:51:18] <shoky_> Twirl:  .find  looks for descendant elements, but you say the <img>'s are the root elements
[19:51:19] <Twirl> chrome's console is showing [img, img, img, img]
[19:51:26] <Twirl> yes it's the root elements
[19:51:35] <shoky_> Twirl:  just do $(data).length will give you something
[19:52:09] <Twirl> nice, that worked, ty man
[19:52:12] <shoky_> $(data).appendTo('#container')  will append those img's to the DOM
[19:52:14] <shoky_> etc.
[19:53:58] <Twirl> nono i'm using it for another script
[19:53:59] <Twirl> ty
