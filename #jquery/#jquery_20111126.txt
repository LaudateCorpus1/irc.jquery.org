[03:28:09] <dnsdds> With the jQuery UI slider, is there a way to make the knob stay within the track, i.e. when it's maxed out, the right edge of the knob lines up with the right edge of the track, instead of going over it?

[04:00:42] <kvarley> How do I reference a combobox or text field based upon the name/id I assign to the html element?
[04:03:30] <MoTiOnXml> kvarley: ?
[04:03:44] <MoTiOnXml> kvarley: using the id + jQuery? :)
[04:03:54] <MoTiOnXml> $(id);
[04:05:07] <kvarley> MoTiOnXml: Ahhh yeah, sorry I'm kinda new to jquery. I was initially doing $('select:first'). but now I have more than one combobox I wanted to reference a specific one and was doing $('select:combo').
[04:07:37] <kvarley>  MoTiOnXml: Does it matter if I use the name attribute instead of id?

[05:54:13] <rethus> i have this little passwordStrength-plugin
[05:54:14] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/LpgD3/1/
[05:54:55] <rethus> i try to generate a var, (allowProceed), which i coud read out from outside of the blugin.
[05:54:58] <rethus> how can i do this?
[05:56:20] <rethus> for example how could i read out the $.fn.shortPass, or the "options" like shortPass: ?
[06:03:43] <rethus> realy low traffic here... still wonder if my irc-chatclient is broken?!
[06:03:51] <rethus> ping
[06:03:55] <rethus> ?next
[06:03:56] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[06:04:01] <rethus> mhh, seems to work
[06:05:15] <Kuni> you are not alone
[06:06:15] <Kuni> I have no experience with jQuery plugin development, though
[06:07:07] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/1/ (simple dropdown menu) - what's the best way of setting the dropdown's min-width to the width of the main nav link?
[06:07:33] <muzone> (looks a bit odd when the dropdown is smaller than its main nav link)
[06:08:11] <rethus> good to know  that i'm not alone ;)
[06:08:14] <Kuni> rethus: are you using .extend()? isn't the first argument supposed to be accessible? (I might be completely off..)
[06:09:41] <rethus> I'm not realy familar with plugin-development, only try to enhace this module to get same callback-value to see, iff the password is good or weak... so i only need a flag like "allowProceed" to prevent the form von going on, till a better password is choosen
[06:11:16] <Kuni> I am certain that .extend() is used to give access to plugin internals, maybe you should locate that call in your module
[06:11:30] <rethus> Now i have add this little "getPassStatus" function to the plugin. http://jsfiddle.net/LpgD3/2/
[06:11:57] <rethus> with $().getPassStatus(), i got the output of $fn.allowProceed in firebug console.
[06:12:49] <rethus> but if i chage the value of allowProceed within another function and request getPassStatus again, i always got same value ...12
[06:13:07] <Kuni> have you looked at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ?
[06:14:07] <Kuni> I am not sure if passing $ in your function is the proper way, you might want to use the tutorial I linked to
[06:14:26] <muzone> yo Kuni u got a sec?
[06:14:35] <muzone> ill give you something cool if u help me
[06:14:42] <muzone> (just a tiny little problem anyway)
[06:14:47] <Kuni> well, yeah, but I am not an expert
[06:15:02] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/1/ (simple dropdown menu) - what's the best way of setting the dropdown's min-width to the width of the main nav link?
[06:15:05] <muzone> (looks a bit odd when the dropdown is smaller than its main nav link)
[06:19:25] <Kuni> hm, you should get the with via .width() when you slide down, I guess; then css('min-width', width) on the drop down?
[06:19:46] <Kuni> no guarantees...
[06:19:46] <muzone> cool
[06:23:41] <muzone> Kuni: could you help me fill in the blanks? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/2/
[06:26:12] <muzone> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/3/ sorry
[06:30:10] <muzone> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/5/ sorry
[06:31:18] <Kuni> hm, I need to learn how this jsfiddle thing works...
[06:32:05] <muzone> hehe
[06:32:07] <muzone> its pretty cool
[06:32:15] <muzone> anyhow latest update: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/6/ - still not working though
[06:35:44] <muzone> Kuni: think you could help me out?
[06:36:44] <Kuni> I am familiarizing myself with jsfiddle, might be a little while
[06:37:16] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody can you show me example of realization onchange() for radio buttons?
[06:38:52] <Kuni> muzone: I am back in the initial version, did that work for you?
[06:39:47] <Kuni> muzone: where hover should produce a simple slide down?
[06:41:40] <troubleman> Kuni: what do you mean?
[06:42:07] <Kuni> troubleman: with what?
[06:42:23] <troubleman> the initial version works fine except when the dropdown has a smaller width than its parent link, it looks odd
[06:43:23] <Kuni> I reduced from a later example, probably mixed something up then
[06:43:51] <Kuni> though, what is hoverIntent?
[06:44:01] <sorrymyeng> somebody?
[06:44:28] <troubleman> Kuni: its just like hover except it more accurately predicts mouse movements
[06:44:37] <troubleman> Kuni: you reduced from a later example?
[06:44:46] <Kuni> it gives me a"not a function"
[06:45:58] <Kuni> I started from a later example and  threw everything out until it workded, then reproduced what I though was the initial example
[06:46:20] <troubleman> i see..
[06:46:22] <Kuni> it's my first attempt with jsfiddle...
[06:46:28] <troubleman> hehe
[06:46:37] <troubleman> let me repost my question though maybe it makes more sense this way:
[06:46:39] <Kuni> but I start to like it ;)
[06:46:42] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/1/ (simple dropdown menu) - what's the best way of setting the dropdown's min-width to the width of the main nav link? (looks a bit odd when the dropdown is smaller than its main nav link)
[06:46:46] <troubleman> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/6/ is what I got so far but it's a mess!
[06:50:44] <DukeDrake> hu
[06:56:00] <kanzie> Im trying to use on() on a select amount of elements, excluding some using $('#foo').not('.class1, .class2').on('click',â€¦ but on does not seem to care about the not-filter. I've also tried inside the event if ( $(this).hasClass('class1, class2') but that won't work either (can't take two classes it seems, fine with just one)
[07:05:22] <troubleman> Kuni: so whats up?
[07:08:56] <Kuni> struggling... but I found out that $("ul") matches all entries in the handler. That can't be good.
[07:14:13] <Kuni> troubleman: a slight improvement http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/7/
[07:14:31] <Kuni> I don't understand via the menu is too wide, though
[07:16:46] <kanzie> How can I extend an object with the id of an element as key? Like $.extend({ $(this).attr('id') : 44}, myObj);
[07:20:40] <Kuni> troubleman:  in this version the sliding containers have exactly the same width as the link containers: http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/8/
[07:21:21] <Kuni> troubleman: the hardcoded -30 is probably some padding that I don't see
[07:21:47] <mgoeppner> Kuni: min-width or max-width?
[07:23:15] <Kuni> mgoeppner: ?
[07:24:52] <Kuni> mgoeppner: not sure what you are refering to here
[07:25:02] <mgoeppner> (don't mind me if i'm wrong, I just got off a 22 hr shift) you want things the same width on that fiddle?
[07:25:37] <Kuni> I am just "fiddling" around, you'd have to ask troubleman what he wants
[07:25:52] <mgoeppner> oh.
[07:26:02] <Kuni> but I'd like to understand where the diff of 30 comes from
[07:27:06] <rworth> dnsdds: see http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
[07:27:43] <rworth> ?tell dnsdds see http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
[07:27:44] <bot-t> rworth, Okay.
[07:28:32] <mgoeppner> Kuni: he is using to to make the flyout wideenough for the text on the headers labled link
[07:29:20] <mgoeppner> should be using min-width rather than padding imho tho
[07:29:23] <Kuni> is it the 30px in css #main ul , then?
[07:29:30] <mgoeppner> yessir
[07:30:06] <Kuni> okay, setting it to 0px looks good
[07:30:23] <mgoeppner> 0px seems to cut off some of the text
[07:31:02] <Kuni> it does?
[07:31:12] <mgoeppner> yeah
[07:31:26] <mgoeppner> http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/17/
[07:31:39] <mgoeppner> i used min-width to get rid of the cutoff
[07:32:33] <mgoeppner> take out the min-width:75px; and hover ovver one of the ones that says "Link", the sub items will be  cut off partially
[07:33:42] <Kuni> no, don't see it here
[07:34:35] <Kuni> you mean some of the "Test" links are cut off?
[07:34:46] <mgoeppner> yeah
[07:34:56] <lilmikey> hi
[07:34:57] <mgoeppner> thats what he was using the padding 30px to avoid
[07:35:13] <mgoeppner> messy way of doing it
[07:35:22] <mgoeppner> min-width is a little better
[07:35:38] <mgoeppner> (a lot actually)
[07:35:47] <lilmikey> How do i remove an element from a parent element and put it somewhere else - that is change the structure of the document?
[07:36:02] <Kuni> damn, I wish I had a better understanding of how all the widths in css interact...
[07:36:35] <mgoeppner> practice makes perfect ;)
[07:36:59] <Kuni> ah, I had taken out the -30 out, with out I see what you mean
[07:36:59] <lilmikey> Kuni, that's easy when you use firebug or chromes developer tools
[07:37:01] <snagnever> hey! i have a doubt about javascript performace: what would be faster -- have a function like somefunc(a,b,c) or some anonymous function with "kida-hard-coded" params for events on lots of elements?
[07:37:01] <mgoeppner> min-width tells the element to be at least the specified size wide
[07:37:14] <snagnever> like here: http://sn4gb0x.no-ip.org:9090/plutao2/diagrama/cordas/55041000.html
[07:38:17] <lilmikey> how can I remove an element via jquery?
[07:38:31] <Kuni> I do know what the individual attributes do, it's just I regularly get surprised by some unexpected side-effect
[07:38:47] <mgoeppner> $(<selector>).remove()
[07:38:57] <lilmikey> Kuni: me too :) especially with ie
[07:39:06] <lilmikey> mgoeppner: thanks! :)
[07:39:21] <mgoeppner> lilmikey: np
[07:40:01] <mgoeppner> I'm off to bed... talk to y'all later.
[07:40:28] <Kuni> night. And thanks
[07:41:36] <mgoeppner> np
[07:44:36] <Kuni> ah, I forgot about my initial question: can a click/hover on the bullet point of a li tag be caught or is it always the complete li tag?
[07:44:52] <Kuni> maybe someone is here now who can answer that :)
[07:45:30] <lilmikey> you can always add a div over that bullet point
[07:47:04] <Kuni> I had thought/hoped to avoid to have a simpler structure. But an extra tag is okay, I guess.
[07:47:20] <lilmikey> using jquery it would be simple to append
[07:47:41] <Kuni> hmm, that sounds promising
[07:47:49] <Kuni> Could have thought of that myself.
[07:49:11] <lilmikey> also, maybe hovering over a specific part of the li - like on right edge - 10px from the right edge
[07:49:51] <lilmikey> that would be a little bit more difficult but then it wouldnt add a new element
[07:50:25] <Kuni> the event data contains the mouse location?
[07:50:57] <Kuni> ah, yes, it does
[07:51:26] <Kuni> though i case of hover it will probably only the entry point, I guess
[07:51:50] <Kuni> I guess a generated extra tag is better
[07:52:25] <lilmikey> i think it is possible to create a function that would compute the mouse location recursively
[07:53:35] <lilmikey> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[07:53:49] <lilmikey> yea
[07:55:12] <lilmikey> problem is, its only crossbrowser compatible with coordinates relative to the window
[07:55:36] <lilmikey> so that would only help if you would put the li in an iframe
[07:55:46] <muzone> Kuni: sup
[07:55:49] <kanzie> How can I extend an object with the id of an element as key? Like $.extend({ $(this).attr('id') : 44}, myObj);
[07:55:49] <muzone> just got back from the store
[07:55:50] <lilmikey> which is too much hassle all together compared to the extra div
[07:56:47] <muzone> Kuni: dope code man!! thanks a lot!
[07:57:02] <Kuni> lilmikey: yeah. Still interesting, though from a theoretical point of view (I am rather theoretical guy -> mathematician)
[07:57:12] <muzone> Kuni: is it possible to set it to min-width though? because the slider will in most cases be wider than the main link width (which is ok)
[07:57:13] <lilmikey> yea :)
[07:57:16] <Kuni> muzone: I had a little help myself ;)
[07:57:31] <Kuni> muzone: which version do you have?
[07:57:54] <Kuni> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/19/  this is my latest one
[07:58:09] <muzone> 19??
[07:58:11] <muzone> i was at 8 :)
[07:58:29] <Kuni> yeah, I had fun fiddling with jsfiddle
[07:58:56] <Kuni> the discovery of jsfiddle alone was alone so worth coming here
[07:58:59] <Kuni> :)
[07:59:02] <muzone> hehe
[07:59:07] <muzone> awesome man
[07:59:10] <muzone> heres the thing i promised:
[07:59:19] <muzone> http://youngblood.probsd.net/stakkenprosjekter.mp3
[07:59:31] <Kuni> yorpromised something?
[07:59:47] <muzone> yup
[07:59:48] <muzone> i sure did
[07:59:52] * muzone pokes coldhead
[07:59:55] <Kuni> din't notice :)
[08:01:35] <Kuni> hm, my spelling abilities decline rapidly
[08:03:41] <Kuni> muzone: there were also some changes in css, though I have not completely understood them - just saying
[08:05:33] <muzone> Kuni: what changes?
[08:06:12] <Kuni> muzone: a 30px padding was interfering and I think there a min-width was added instead?
[08:06:42] <Kuni> muzone: oh, and if hoverIntent works for you (ddin't work for me), it might be better
[08:09:36] <Mookman288> Are there guidelines to post questions?
[08:10:13] <Kuni> To quote the topic: Just ask! ;)
[08:17:37] <muzone> Kuni: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/21/ seems to work
[08:17:47] <Kuni> muzone:  well, not quite my style of music, but let's say... interesting ;)
[08:17:48] <muzone> modified my original based on your code
[08:18:03] <muzone> im glad!
[08:19:04] <Mookman288> http://jsfiddle.net/79YuV/ - I'm working on creating a system where hovering over a link causes a div to slideDown. When focus is changed to the div, I would like that div to remain down until focus is lost on either the link or the div (of course, if focus is reinitialized within 1/2 a second, I would like it to remain open.)
[08:19:08] <Kuni> ah now hoverIntent works for me. I saw that it is from an extra plugin, did you activate that somewhere?
[08:19:23] <Mookman288> My issue comes from 1.) the div not staying down when focus is changed
[08:20:03] <muzone> Kuni: yes!
[08:20:13] <Mookman288> Oh man, Muzone, you're working on the same thing I am.
[08:20:14] <kanzie> is this a bug in jQuery $.change() or am I missing something? http://jsfiddle.net/KZ6mE/
[08:20:24] <Mookman288> However, yours is much easier than mine.
[08:20:25] <muzone> Kuni: in "Manage Resource" you can add external js files ;)
[08:20:32] <muzone> Mookman288: well i just finished mine :D
[08:20:45] <muzone> thanks to all the generous folks in here
[08:20:48] <muzone> thanks again..
[08:20:50] <Mookman288> I'm using Div's instead of nested lists.
[08:21:02] <muzone> Mookman288: i think lists are more "correct"
[08:21:03] <Kuni> muzone: ah, useful to know
[08:21:05] <muzone> im not sure though
[08:21:13] <Mookman288> They are, but I do not have that luxury.
[08:21:25] <Mookman288> Mine needs to have content, headers, paragraphs, etc. within the actual submenu.
[08:21:51] <muzone> oh you mean like a megamenu?
[08:22:09] <muzone> those are cool
[08:22:11] <Mookman288> Yes, I suppose so.
[08:22:22] <muzone> the folks in here just helped me make one (kinda like www.farfetch.com but with far better / simpler code)
[08:22:37] <muzone> fuck
[08:22:43] <muzone> i deleted the fiddle :(
[08:22:50] <muzone> it was really cool though
[08:23:25] <Kuni> Mookman288: what do you expect to happen in your .change example?
[08:24:27] <kanzie> Kuni: if we are talking about .change() perhaps you can explain why this won't trigger a change-event http://jsfiddle.net/KZ6mE/
[08:24:59] <Mookman288> When one hovers over "Navigation 0", #hover-0 should expand. When the user moves the cursor to #hover-0, #hover-0 should remain expanded until the user has left both #hover-0 and "Navigation 0" for a specified time.
[08:25:45] <Mookman288> Conceptually: While mouseenter either #hover-0 OR this, expand; otherwise, hide.
[08:26:43] <Kuni> kanzie:  oh sorry,  wrong person addressed. Good thing you caught it: I see the problem now, too, maybe a race condition?
[08:28:27] <kanzie> Kuni: hmm, I don't knowâ€¦ would that not be the simplest use-case for change()
[08:31:01] <Kuni> kanzie:  it also happens if the value change is moved to a second document.ready function
[08:31:55] <kanzie> Kuni: man, I feel so stupid, surely Im doing something wrong.
[08:32:33] <kanzie> Im also having problems with serialize() of a form, can't understand why it won't give me anything. Is it that the form is wrapping around a table or something. Feels like right now nothing is working :-)
[08:33:42] <Kuni> you can manually fire the change() event, thogh: $('#foo').change();
[08:34:43] <Kuni> could be that assigning value is like typing into the box: the change fires when you press enter or leave box
[08:39:56] <Kuni> well, I am afk now.
[08:44:54] <troubleman> later Kuni !
[09:04:37] <enoj-> To any admins: Seems there are some server issues with minimizing jquery mobile, look at line #2 and #3 here, completely breaks it for anyone using the CDN to load jquery mobile: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[09:05:41] <ajpiano> enoj-: thank you for reporting that, i'll pass it alone
[09:05:42] <ajpiano> along*
[09:07:05] <enoj-> you're welcome :)
[09:09:14] <Zeph88|Worrk> Can anyone point me in the right direction to re-write this snippet? http://pastebin.com/TvE17mPC I found it as a way to check the cache and reload on an offline web app on an iPad, but when I update the cache it is sometimes getting stuck in a loop
[09:14:54] <Zeph88|Worrk> Ah, it was swapCache that was breaking it. update() worked. nvm :)
[09:20:55] <Zeph88|Worrk> oh. nvm it did not fix it, if anyone has experience with applicationCache please let me know, I am seeing odd ehavior
[09:23:04] <asher^> hi all, im wondering if i can do a selector for text inside a span with a specific class
[09:23:27] <skamikaze> asher^: select the span? :)
[09:24:02] <asher^> ive done that, what im doing is changing the contents of the span when i click it from text to an input
[09:24:02] <kollapse> Hi. If I pastebin a big JS file (800+ lines), can you give me some fast tips on where I can improve (such as speed) ?
[09:24:10] <asher^> at the moment if i click it twice it screws it up
[09:25:22] <skamikaze> asher^: toggle state by a css class or unbind the click handler after first click
[09:25:51] <asher^> i tried removing the class that catches the click, that didnt work. how do i unbind the click handler?
[09:26:29] <kollapse> Well here goes nothing: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/513239/ (please don't shoot)
[09:26:36] <skamikaze> ?unbind @ asher^
[09:26:36] <bot-t> asher^, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[09:26:57] <asher^> thanks
[09:27:21] <skamikaze> asher^: i tried to say: add an extra css class on first click and check for that existance in your click handler
[09:27:27] <asher^> wonderful!
[09:27:36] <asher^> thanks guys
[09:28:02] <skamikaze> kollapse: pastebinit from linux cli :P
[09:28:14] <ajpiano> kollapse: don't use an array as a hash
[09:28:26] <ajpiano> names_types is all wrong
[09:28:52] <kollapse> What's the alternative ?
[09:29:04] <ajpiano> lol
[09:29:08] <ajpiano> doing what you do one line afteR?
[09:29:15] <ajpiano> and using an object as a hash?
[09:29:33] <ajpiano> http://andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/
[09:31:33] <ajpiano> kollapse: is there a specific reason you wrote your own ajax abstraction even though you're using jquery?
[09:33:38] <kollapse> ajpiano: Not really, I just always used my own version even before jQuery, it just kind of got stuck to me.
[09:33:51] <ajpiano> kollapse: i don't have time to get that in depth with this
[09:34:08] <ajpiano> but if you want my takeaway it's not performance you have to be concerned about right now, it's code strcuture
[09:34:21] <ajpiano> right now you are following the ALOGF pattern
[09:34:25] <ajpiano> ?ALOGF
[09:34:25] <bot-t> A Lot Of Global Functions
[09:35:20] <kollapse> Hmm. So I should do something like 'var fn = { f1: function(...){...}, f2: function(...){...), ... };' ?
[09:35:21] <ajpiano> which means.... unstrucutred code with many duplicative operations and very little sense of flow
[09:35:35] <ajpiano> kollapse: that's a starting point
[09:35:43] <easyrider> Hi, does anybody know what data format is this "s:7:"resdata";a:8:{s:8:"greeting";s:7:"abc9999";s:4:"svID";s:6:"Serwer";s:7:"version";s:3:"2.1";s:4:"lang";s:2:"pl";s:6:"?
[09:35:53] <ajpiano> but lumping everything into one object is what you already have
[09:36:05] <ajpiano> essesntially... that object is just the window
[09:36:28] <ajpiano> if i were you i'd have some kind of class/plugin/whatever you want to call it, that i could call on a table
[09:37:14] <ajpiano> which would give "the table" control of what's inside it
[09:37:32] <ajpiano> denoting all your functions with "fn" is kind of crazy town as well
[09:38:37] <ajpiano> kollapse: if you use jQuery.ajax you leave significantly less overhead for someone who inherits this code after you from having to grok your handrolled AJAX API
[09:38:46] <ajpiano> instead they can use what's already familiar with they know jQuery
[09:39:34] <ajpiano> you need to watch out for things like, in your ajax abstraction.... you take an element reference you already have, grab it's ID, then pass the string ID to your ajax thing and then do $( id )
[09:39:47] <ajpiano> which is redundant and makes kittens cry
[09:40:09] <ajpiano> kollapse: jQuery also has a jQuery.param method
[09:40:14] <ajpiano> for converting objects to query strings, etc
[09:40:36] <ajpiano> and then the most general thing i'd say is
[09:40:51] <ajpiano> unlesss it is absolutely positively unavoidable
[09:41:15] <ajpiano> generating your JS inside of php, and worse, actually generating code with php, is really something one wants to avoid
[09:41:27] <easyrider> Anybody willing to help, here?
[09:42:08] <ajpiano> here, it looks like yo'ure just bootstrapping in some data, so i would try to approach that by burying all that data in in the DOM somewhere and parsing it out on init
[09:42:33] <ajpiano> instead of having dynamically generated js code in the middle of your app
[09:43:04] <kollapse> ajpiano: That means I have to give JS another job, which would be another hit on performance.
[09:43:16] <kollapse> Also, I would have to pass a unique PHP generated token to JS so I can prevent things such as CSRF.
[09:43:18] <ajpiano> easyrider: it looks kind of like JSON
[09:43:48] <ajpiano> kollapse: you need to get a handle on what is and isn't a performance problem
[09:44:03] <easyrider> ajpiano: there getJson can't handle it
[09:44:25] <easyrider> there are syntax errors when interpreted as json
[09:44:25] <ajpiano> "oh no, i did something on the client side that makes sense to be handle on the client side - it's a performance hit" is not a good way to go about writing JS
[09:45:41] <ajpiano> kollapse: i understand that you might have some particular reason why you feel it's absolutely necessary at the moment
[09:46:15] <ajpiano> but the best practise definitely is to avoid dynamically generating JS using your server-side language
[09:46:51] <ajpiano> or as i said, if you must do so, attempt to silo that stuff off from the rest of the code that isn't dynamically generated
[09:47:15] <ajpiano> instead of having a file that's 90% static code and then right in the middle is a block of generated JS
[09:47:48] <ajpiano> easyrider: i mean, the string you posted looks malformed
[09:47:59] <ajpiano> i didn't say it was valid JSON, i said it looks kind of like JSON
[09:48:02] <kollapse> ajpiano: Well for the moment I am under the impression that my app is using too much resources. It takes 100-150 ms to load a table with 200 cells and about 2.5 seconds for 5000 cells (on a fast CPU btw) and it uses up 40% CPU on hovering and using tooltips. I feel as this is not normal.
[09:48:33] <ajpiano> are you building the entire table on the client side?
[09:48:59] <ajpiano> you probably need to really work on minimising your DOM touches
[09:49:10] <ajpiano> ?g reasons to use append correctly
[09:49:11] <bot-t> ajpiano, 43439 reasons to use append() correctly » Learning jQuery - Tips ... - http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[09:49:58] <kollapse> ajpiano: Yes. The app is meant to be a general frontend for a database system. It builds the entire table. Should I opt for a limited initial load and then progressive load via ajax through user interaction ? (such as when going to page 2)
[09:50:08] <ajpiano> kollapse: definitely
[09:50:26] <ajpiano> and then you'd want to use like, javascript templates to add more data
[09:50:46] <luite> there are existing grid libraries that already do most of the work
[09:50:52] <ajpiano> ... that too
[09:51:16] <ajpiano> and they're really fast
[09:51:20] <kollapse> Well I am using DataTables, a jQuery plugin. It comes with table management functions such as sorting, pagination, dynamic searching etc.
[09:51:54] <luite> ah right, then it probably has some data view that allows you to incrementally load data
[09:53:44] <kollapse> Thanks for the hints, guys, I'll get right on it.
[09:53:59] <ajpiano> kollapse: are you aware of what a "reflow" is
[09:54:15] <easyrider> ajpiano: Do you have any idea how can I get the data from different domain (not valid json?) ?
[09:54:47] <ajpiano> kollapse: you'd probably be well served to take a look at http://code.google.com/speed/articles/reflow.html
[09:54:55] <ajpiano> easyrider: you can use JSONP
[09:55:02] <ajpiano> but that requires both valid JSON and it to be served up as JSONP
[09:55:31] <ajpiano> you can also try one of the approaches listed here, see

[09:55:35] <bot-t> workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[09:55:51] <ajpiano> but if you're requesting data that's in a broken format, expect a broken application
[09:58:48] <easyrider> ajpiano: I suppose the data is serialised I found in php it can be handled: $serialized_object='O:1:"a":1:{s:5:"value";s:3:"100";}';
[09:59:06] <ajpiano> easyrider: read about what actually constitutes valid JSON
[09:59:21] <ajpiano> easyrider: if you want to pass JSON back from php, use the json_encode function on php data strcutures
[09:59:28] <ajpiano> do not attempt to manually serialize the data yourself
[10:00:01] <easyrider> I don't have control on data format
[10:00:11] <easyrider> I need just to handle it with JS
[10:00:18] <ajpiano> well then go punch the asshole who decided you to pass you an arbitrary made up data format
[10:00:21] <ajpiano> and get a new job
[10:00:31] <easyrider> hehe ;0
[10:01:03] <easyrider> maybe you're right
[10:01:15] <ajpiano> i am right
[10:01:25] <ajpiano> there are a variety of parseable data interchange formats
[10:01:41] <ajpiano> saying "i'm gonna give you a string that isn't any of those, have a good time parsing it" is absurd
[10:02:29] <easyrider> but it is a test
[10:02:39] <easyrider> they want to check me
[10:03:06] <ajpiano> well then saying to them "give me the data in a valid format like JSON instead of 'almost JSON'  should prove your qualifications"
[10:03:42] <ajpiano> and if they're like, no, we were testing you , all our data is in nonsense nonstandard formats, then you need to check THEM and not get a job there, lol
[10:03:53] <[mgw]> lol
[10:04:29] <[mgw]> i was in a consulting sit. where i was too young to muster the gusto to requset the data i was handed be properly formatted
[10:04:44] <[mgw]> so we sat and tried to mash 10mb of GPS data into google maps
[10:05:02] <[mgw]> rather than get an easy as pie KPL or whateer format import, it was a month from hell
[10:05:43] <ajpiano> that sucks
[10:05:50] <[mgw]> we did it :)
[10:06:01] <easyrider> nice :)
[10:06:49] <asher^> is there a way to select an element that has a specific id AND class?
[10:07:01] <easyrider> ajpiano: PHP unserialised data to proper arrays
[10:07:30] <ajpiano> easyrider: six unicorns and a jug of milk
[10:07:39] <ajpiano> are we just naming random things?
[10:08:30] <easyrider> ajpiano: what do you mean by random things?
[10:08:53] <ajpiano> i mean you didn't say a sentence or ask a question
[10:09:04] <ajpiano> you just said " PHP unserialised data to proper arrays" with no context
[10:09:47] <easyrider> i wonder if jquery could do the same
[10:09:59] <ajpiano> i'm gonna go ahead and leave
[10:10:01] <ajpiano> for now
[10:10:08] <easyrider> ok thx anyway :)
[10:11:25] <[mgw]> lol
[10:11:34] <Axilla> how would I load a HTML file into the container div for a menu
[10:11:51] <[mgw]> your q is too generic
[10:11:54] <Axilla> so lets say I click on a link "Upload" i want to load upload.html into Div ajax
[10:12:05] <Axilla> I have the loading working
[10:12:15] <Axilla> i can load text or whatever into DIV ajax
[10:12:16] <[mgw]> unserial data in PHP is still a specific format
[10:12:30] <[mgw]> go check out JSON.js
[10:12:30] <Axilla> but i can't for the life of me figure out how to load a static html page
[10:12:43] <Axilla> i'm well aware of JSON.js
[10:12:46] <Axilla> but i don't need JSON.js
[10:13:03] <[mgw]> Axilla sorry was talking to easyrider
[10:13:09] <[mgw]> i think you have to consider images and stuff
[10:13:21] <Axilla> ahhh ok
[10:13:27] <Axilla> what do you mean?
[10:13:31] <[mgw]> i mean that sometimes i've seen the DOM do weird stuff
[10:13:37] <[mgw]> like it has trouble attaching some items post-load
[10:13:40] <ajpiano> Axilla: $("#somediv").load("somepage.html")
[10:13:46] <[mgw]> or making it take space in the page
[10:13:50] <Axilla> is somediv my target div
[10:13:55] <[mgw]> yah
[10:13:56] <Axilla> and I've tried that
[10:13:59] <Axilla> can't get it to work
[10:14:07] <[mgw]> have you checked to see if the markup is there on the page?
[10:14:09] <ajpiano> it works, if it doesn't work post a live demo of it failing
[10:14:18] <Axilla> ok
[10:19:15] <dirkpennings> hi guys.. does someone know a jQuery plugin that's similar to the Mac App Store "header slideshow" ?
[10:19:31] <zipR4ND> hi all, i'm having trouble with the keyup event on a div. it works on chromium but not on firefox :-(
[10:23:45] <AngryAsian> can you show me the code @zipR4ND?
[10:24:36] <zipR4ND> AngryAsian: this is the div: <div contentEditable=\"true\"  class=\"etherpad\" id=\""+this.id+"\"></div>
[10:24:45] <zipR4ND> $("#"+this.id).keypress(function(){displayMessage("hi");});
[10:24:52] <zipR4ND> this is the jquery
[10:25:07] <zipR4ND> i don't post it all, it's tiddlywiki
[10:27:59] <[mgw]> does $.on work like $.live?
[10:28:12] <[mgw]> like if i add new elements to the DOM, will the events hook, because they aren't :(
[10:28:38] <[mgw]> oooo i guess i could wrap up all my event hook function calls and call it a second time
[10:29:58] <ajpiano> [mgw]: it works "like" live
[10:30:02] <ajpiano> it does not work identically to live
[10:30:10] <Axilla> ok
[10:30:11] <Axilla> so
[10:30:15] <ajpiano> to simluate live with on you do $(document).on("event", "selector', fn);
[10:30:24] <Axilla> maybe i'm being retarded
[10:30:27] <ajpiano> NOT $("selector").on("event", fn)
[10:30:29] <ajpiano> that's the same as bind
[10:30:32] <Axilla> ajpiano: live demo of it failing and working
[10:30:59] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND i cant get that to work for some reason (chrome and firefox)
[10:31:15] <ajpiano> Axilla: post it, i'm going t get a pastry
[10:31:34] <Axilla> ok i will, gotta fix my firewall
[10:31:42] <zipR4ND> maybe you need do deescape the "
[10:31:48] <AngryAsian> I did all that
[10:32:34] <zipR4ND> hmm, so you arrived at the point, where i'm stuck
[10:32:59] <AngryAsian> well it never worked in the first place. Not even in chrome.
[10:33:06] <AngryAsian> maybe i need chromium
[10:33:09] <zipR4ND> i use chromium
[10:33:10] <zipR4ND> yes
[10:33:12] <AngryAsian> you're on linux i presume
[10:33:17] <zipR4ND> yes
[10:35:28] <Axilla> ajpiano: http://71.234.169.157/zbbxchange/login.php  -- use test/test then click on upload it should load upload.html which would be an upload file form but it doesn't.
[10:36:23] <Axilla> well technically it loads slide-content.html which it does just fine
[10:36:38] <Axilla> slide-content.html contains div's with the content for each link
[10:42:33] <ajpiano> Axilla: you see that the code is throwing an error in the callback, right?
[10:42:40] <ajpiano> Axilla: are you using firebug/chrome dev tools/etc?
[10:42:55] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND it works in firefox and chrome.  I just looked at console and it was just because "displayMessage" was (clearly) not defined.
[10:43:02] <AngryAsian> so i console.logged it and it works
[10:43:12] <Axilla> nope
[10:43:15] <Axilla> i have firebug
[10:43:23] <ajpiano> Axilla: well by all means, feel free to start using it
[10:43:32] <ajpiano> Axilla: are you familiar with js debugging techniques
[10:43:41] <Axilla> not to much just learning
[10:43:46] <zipR4ND> AngryAsian: hmm
[10:43:53] <AngryAsian> might be a linux thing?
[10:43:58] <ajpiano> ?ftj @ Axilla
[10:43:59] <bot-t> Axilla, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:44:11] <zipR4ND> maybe, but why should the JS engine be any different in linux
[10:44:13] <zipR4ND> ?
[10:45:27] <Axcy> If I want to change a value of a hidden input field, can I just do a onclick="$('#tx_feusersview_pi1[signupGroup]').val('14'); ?
[10:45:34] <Axcy> Cuz it doesn't seem to work :(
[10:46:03] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND: http://jsfiddle.net/rwpSg/1/
[10:46:08] <Axilla> aye
[10:46:11] <Axilla> i fixed it
[10:46:14] <AngryAsian> no clue man :(
[10:48:00] <AngryAsian> maybe update your firefox (if it isn't already)
[10:49:24] <zipR4ND> it desnt work
[10:50:06] <AngryAsian> what version of firefox are you using on linux?
[10:50:14] <AngryAsian> maybe its a bug or something that someones already pointed out
[10:51:42] <AngryAsian> try adding event.preventDefault(); after the console.log? maybe that'll make things work
[10:52:24] <Axcy> Anyone got a idea in regards to my problem.. can't seem to change a the value of a hidden input field :(
[10:52:39] <AngryAsian> hah that doesnt even let the words come up.  event.preventdefault is a bad idea
[10:54:41] <zipR4ND> AngryAsian: 8
[10:55:59] <AngryAsian> I really should be on linux to solve this problem of yours. Unfortunately that'll mean going into another room at 12:30in the morning and potentially causing trouble for myself
[10:56:09] <AngryAsian> (other laptop dual boots)
[10:56:15] <AngryAsian> sry :(
[10:57:05] <Axilla> suse 4tw :)
[10:57:06] <thebignoise> when i do $('.something') i get [<div>asdflkjasdf</div>] -- what do the [ ] mean?
[10:57:21] <thebignoise> in the console.
[10:57:38] <ajpiano> it means it's in a jquery object, which the console renders like an array
[10:57:47] <AngryAsian> do $('.something')[0] if that would explain things to you better
[10:58:15] <thebignoise> ajpiano: okay thats what i thought, now my question is can i make something returned w/ out the [ ] an object?
[10:58:23] <ajpiano> huh
[10:58:34] <AngryAsian> do what I said
[10:58:42] <thebignoise> lol... im using zeroclipboard which is a flash thing that lets u copy
[10:59:14] <ajpiano> maybe you don't want to be sending the element's text, not the element or a jquery object of said element
[10:59:23] <thebignoise> but the flash thing isn't an object
[10:59:48] <AngryAsian> I THINK he doesnt want an array.  he just wants the element.  so if he does $('.something')[0] he'll get what he wants.
[11:00:09] <thebignoise> AngryAsian: i can get the element
[11:00:10] <ajpiano> i think he doesn't quite know what he want, but if you're right, great :)
[11:00:18] <AngryAsian> lol
[11:00:18] <thebignoise> but it needs to be an object so i can .click
[11:00:32] <AngryAsian> oh
[11:00:39] <thebignoise> ajpiano: lol i know exactly what i want
[11:00:49] <ajpiano> "it without the [ ]"
[11:01:00] <AngryAsian> so do var elem = $('.something')[0].  $(var).click(function(){});
[11:01:05] <AngryAsian> ffs
[11:01:06] <AngryAsian> i mean
[11:01:08] <AngryAsian> $(elem)
[11:01:09] <ajpiano> lol that is completley pointless
[11:01:23] <AngryAsian> it does what he wants :P
[11:01:32] <ajpiano> so does $(".something").first()
[11:01:33] <AngryAsian> in a really weird way
[11:01:41] <AngryAsian> yeah which is what heshould use
[11:01:47] <ajpiano> BUT it is pointless
[11:01:53] <ajpiano> because he already said it was only one element
[11:01:53] <ajpiano> lol
[11:02:22] <AngryAsian> idk what he wants to do.  im crossing my fingers that i solved his problem
[11:03:11] <thebignoise> Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'first'
[11:03:16] <[mgw]> oh my life just made a lot more sense :)
[11:03:20] <[mgw]> yay code
[11:03:25] <AngryAsian> lol
[11:04:01] <AngryAsian> alright big nose.  you want a div such that when you click on it
[11:04:03] <AngryAsian> stuff happens?
[11:04:06] <AngryAsian> amirite?
[11:04:17] <thebignoise> AngryAsian: correct
[11:04:34] <ajpiano> thebignoise: what is wrong with $(".something").click(function() { });
[11:04:41] <zipR4ND> AngryAsian: no problem, thanks for your help, now i know
[11:05:01] <zipR4ND> is there any way ot easily emulate keyup with say ... keypress
[11:05:03] <thebignoise> ajpiano: its says Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'click'
[11:05:05] <ajpiano> thebignoise:  you were the guy last night trying to do var foo+i = new ZeroClipboard() or something right
[11:05:17] <AngryAsian> do what ajpiano did right now. and you win big nose. assuming the class of your div is "something"
[11:05:21] <thebignoise> ajpiano: yea lol this flash copy shit is so gay
[11:05:24] <AngryAsian> are you actally using jquery?
[11:05:26] <ajpiano> thebignoise: then you don't have a jquery object
[11:05:38] <ajpiano> thebignoise: it has nothing to do with the "flash copy shit" being "gay"
[11:05:44] <thebignoise> ajpiano: haha ik thats what i said. i was wonder if you could force it to be one
[11:06:00] <ajpiano> thebignoise: it has everything to do with you not understanding javascript syntax constructs and the meaning of error messages
[11:06:12] <thebignoise> ajpiano: i know exactly what i means
[11:06:18] <AngryAsian> thebignose: you can use .onClick which is a normal javascript property
[11:06:37] <ajpiano> thebignoise: jQuery(".foo") should definitely work, assuming jQuery is loaded
[11:08:18] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND and i have no clue. but http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html might be a good read.
[11:08:32] <AngryAsian> are you just typing in the chrome console thebignose?
[11:10:30] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND : http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html in particular
[11:11:35] <thebignoise> AngryAsian, ajpiano: got it guys thanx
[11:11:40] <AngryAsian> zipR4ND : might just be cause you're doing it on a div instead of say a textbox? does your code work for textboxes?
[11:11:42] <AngryAsian> yay!
[11:11:50] <zipR4ND> yes
[11:11:52] <AngryAsian> * high fives ajpiano *
[11:11:58] <zipR4ND> but i need an editablediv
[11:12:30] <AngryAsian> yeah they are cooler, I know. :(
[11:13:04] <AngryAsian> is this app you're making for linux mainly? cause it'll work for like 90% of the poeple
[11:16:28] <AngryAsian> can you try binding a keypress to the div?
[11:16:39] <AngryAsian> instead of using .keypress() from jquery itself
[11:17:00] <JakeSays> are there any good forms/data entry plugins for jquery?
[11:17:41] <AngryAsian> or somehow basically capture all events to that editable div.  and figure out what type it calls on keypress for firefox
[11:19:42] <varnie> hello
[11:20:07] <varnie> how can I hide a layer so that it will be invisible from the very page loading?
[11:20:24] <varnie> I don't want to see an "animation" of how does it gets hidden:)
[11:24:19] <ajpiano> varnie: use css
[11:24:50] <varnie> and how can I apply new "css rules" depending on what's stored in the cookies?
[11:24:52] <Axcy> http://jsfiddle.net/XGSxU/9/ <- Can anyone tell my why the damn input value doesn't change when you click on the tD?
[11:24:55] <Axcy> Driving me nuts
[11:25:29] <ajpiano> Axcy: that's not how we write code with jquery
[11:25:55] <ajpiano> Axcy: also you have to escape metacharacters in selectors, see ?escaping
[11:25:55] <bot-t> Axcy, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[11:26:58] <ajpiano> Axcy: http://jsfiddle.net/XGSxU/11/
[11:28:14] <Axcy> >< Such a simple thing.. thanks ajpiano - But isn't that a lot of extra code when I have around 10 different table cells, which are all supposed to do the same(Except give a different value)
[11:28:19] <Mookman288> I'm having issues with a megamenu: http://jsfiddle.net/dsSbd/1/    I'm trying to set it so that hovering over an anchor, or the div it's designed to show, will consistently maintain that appearence until the user moves away.
[11:28:27] <ajpiano> Axcy: that was a demonstration
[11:28:30] <ajpiano> you don't have to use ids
[11:28:43] <ryanneufeld> shitty racks!
[11:29:32] <Axcy> ajpiano: Excuse my ignorance.. but what can I do instead ?
[11:29:52] <Spikes> hi, does anyone know how to deal with cross domain (subdomain) script access to iframes that are spwaned by that script?
[11:29:53] <Axcy> use $("td") for example?
[11:30:10] <Spikes> spawned*
[11:31:02] <ryanneufeld> ?sop @ Spikes
[11:31:02] <bot-t> Spikes, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[11:31:06] <ajpiano> Axcy: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/XGSxU/12/
[11:32:01] <Spikes> so, i should check if protocol and port and host matches
[11:33:18] <ryanneufeld> Spikes: only if those things match, will your iframes be able to communicate
[11:33:21] <Axcy> nice- Thanks ajpiano
[11:33:37] <ryanneufeld> Spikes: there is another way, but it involves you having control of the iframe content
[11:34:01] <Spikes> ryanneufeld, i do have control over it
[11:34:10] <ryanneufeld> Spikes: you can set document.domain to the same thing in both the iframe and the parent frame and then you can communicate between them
[11:35:05] <Spikes> ryanneufeld, tried, doesn't seem to be working
[11:38:24] <Spikes> ryanneufeld, script from subdomain uses document.createElelemt to create iframe, then appends it to the body and iframe does some stuff. Even though iframe domain and document.domain do match, still no access to the content
[11:38:38] <Spikes> says that i can't read protected variable
[11:38:52] <ryanneufeld> not sure
[11:49:02] <Prot> best way to check if attribute exists?
[11:49:16] <Prot> .attr('something')!=undefined ?
[11:50:14] <varnie> if I hide some html item on $(document).ready() ... there is some "animation"
[11:50:18] <varnie> how can I avoid it?
[11:50:32] <Eviltwin> Prot: !== undefined
[11:50:41] <Prot> thx
[11:50:51] <varnie> firstly the item is visible and after a second it is hidden.
[11:52:17] <Eviltwin> varnie: http://jsfiddle.net/evjCP/
[11:53:49] <Eviltwin> I don't see any animation
[11:55:03] <varnie> yes
[11:55:10] <varnie> then smth is wrong with my page...
[11:56:53] <varnie> maybe the delay is because it takes time to get the value from cookies
[11:56:53] <tash> I've got the jq datepicker set on id=date and timepicket set on id=time ... some reason though, when I echo $_POST they aren't showing up at all ... they are empty, any ideas?
[11:57:10] <varnie> to be able to consider what  to do - to make visible or to hide
[11:58:25] <tash> yeah, date and time aren't being put in the POST
[11:58:28] <tash> any ideas why?
[11:58:51] <ngharo> varnie: read the cookie server side and print out inline css
[11:59:02] <tash> print_r($_POST); yields all other vars and their value, but not datepicker and timepicker
[11:59:26] <varnie> strange, I commented out that cookies-related stuff and trying just to hide two items
[11:59:35] <varnie> and there's the animation
[12:00:26] <ngharo> tash: and they're input elements?
[12:00:29] <learner> can anyone explain how the xss vector works in version 1.6.3
[12:00:39] <eddiemonge> tash try $_REQUEST
[12:03:38] <tash> eddiemonge: tried $_REQUEST and they aren't in there
[12:03:57] <tash> ngharo: yes, they are input type="text"
[12:04:25] <eddiemonge> tash: you got any code to show?
[12:04:31] <tash> both of them ... then I have $(function() { $("#date").datepicket(); });
[12:04:36] <tash> yeah, let me just paste into pastie
[12:04:37] <tash> sec
[12:04:43] <lduros> I just noticed that amazon.com has no <!doctype>
[12:04:50] <lduros> isn't that weird?
[12:05:06] <lduros> it loads in quirks mode
[12:05:20] <tash> I didn't paste my entire form b/c it is working, but I pasted the relevant code: http://pastie.org/2925306
[12:05:40] <tash> brb
[12:05:42] <lduros> at least some pages, like the product detail pages, they have no doctype
[12:05:44] <lduros> that is weird
[12:09:43] <tash> back
[12:09:55] <tash> eddiemonge: get a chance to look?
[12:11:57] <eddiemonge> whats the part that submits the form
[12:12:31] <tash> method="POST" action="<?php echo $this->action('create_reminder');?>"
[12:13:06] <tash> that bit of it is fine though, as I said, the form submits and every other input element is put in $_POST
[12:13:43] <varnie> how can I trace what is going on in JS?
[12:15:33] <eddiemonge> tash: it would help to have a working example at jsfiddle.net
[12:15:38] <ryanneufeld> tash: is that code igniter?
[12:16:48] <tash> ryanneufeld: not sure what code igniter is :P
[12:17:30] <ryanneufeld> $this->action('create_reminder'); just reminded me of it that's all
[12:17:35] <ryanneufeld> it's a php framework
[12:17:44] <tash> oh, no ... it's Concrete5
[12:18:36] <tash> eddiemonge: I can probably take a sec and do jsfiddle, but just out of curiosity ... should the jq datepicket and timepicker have any problems getting themselves into POST?
[12:22:09] <eddiemonge> tash: no, thats why i think you have something else going on in your form
[12:24:29] <tash> eddiemonge: I think I figured it out
[12:25:00] <tash> don't have time to fix it now ... but I forgot that I used to use dojo in this form.  Looks like the xhr is dojo stuff still
[12:25:01] <tash> grrr
[12:28:10] <JakeSays> i'm looking for a forms package for jquery similar in nature to extjs forms. any suggestions?
[12:29:13] <eddiemonge> to do what?
[12:30:03] <JakeSays> build forms?
[12:30:17] <JakeSays> with inline validation, etc
[12:30:21] <JakeSays> in modal dialogs
[12:35:34] <learner> would anyone know how the XSS vector is executed in version 1.6.3
[12:35:48] <Eviltwin> What?
[12:36:14] <eddiemonge> JakeSays: whats wrong with normal html with a validate plugin?
[12:37:18] <JakeSays> its a pain in the ass
[12:37:37] <JakeSays> also, we're currently doing it that way and it sucks
[12:38:31] <eddiemonge> jquery isnt a framework for creating pages. its a utility library to help you do stuff quickly with stuff thats there
[12:39:06] <JakeSays> yeah i know that, but the people who wrote our site apparently don't.
[12:39:39] <JakeSays> so i have a pile of useless jquery/backbone/html crap i have to fix
[12:45:07] <eddiemonge> JakeSays: use a template framework to help with creating the markup
[12:45:29] <JakeSays> we're using mustache
[12:45:36] <JakeSays> sadly
[12:46:51] <eddiemonge> why sadly?
[12:48:16] <JakeSays> i would've preferred jquery templates
[12:50:17] <JakeSays> well, i'll just have to make this mess work. any suggestions for a good inline validation plugin? (one that validates a field on blur, etc)
[12:56:57] <eddiemonge> JakeSays: you could look at  see ? validate
[12:57:01] <bot-t> JakeSays, Plugins/Validation - This documentation is moving to a new home http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[12:57:13] <JakeSays> ah cool
[12:59:06] <caseyburk> How might one "grab" (and display) the contents of an active h2 inside a DIV with an id of "test_div"? What would the key functions be?
[12:59:11] <JakeSays> ok thats not bad.
[13:00:37] <Eviltwin> $("#test_div h2").text() or $("#test_div h2").html() ?
[13:01:53] <caseyburk> Eviltwin: Thanks.
[13:02:57] <richardr> I have a library that reads and API and renders HTML. The HTML rendered (template) depends on the template you pass through to the jQuery plugin as an argument. These template are just defined as functions, essentially the rendering process. BUT, I want to set the header/footer of each template separately as I might need to call the data part of it again, and again to 'show more results'. What's a good approach? Thanks
[13:04:08] <ryanneufeld> have you considered using something like underscore or moustache?
[13:04:14] <ryanneufeld> or handlebars
[13:04:31] <richardr> I can't use any external dependencies, other than latest version of jQuery
[13:05:00] <ryanneufeld> richardr: that seems strange
[13:05:13] <richardr> ryanneufeld: it's a widget
[13:05:19] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:05:32] <ryanneufeld> well, what you could do is define a header and footer template function
[13:05:44] <ryanneufeld> have that called at the start and end of your templates
[13:06:25] <ryanneufeld> then you can pass an additional boolean param (or two) to the functions to decide if they should call the header and footer
[13:06:42] <richardr> ryanneufeld: that's a good idea, thanks. And these 'templates' i'm passing into the jquery plugin, any advice on its structure? at the moment its just a function, takes data param, renders html I need
[13:06:44] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you're friggen NINJA!
[13:07:11] <ryanneufeld> richardr: that I can't help you with. You might want to look at how some of the other templating libs out there work
[13:07:28] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: lol, i'm just trying to end this one, dumping letters
[13:08:19] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah, looks like game over, I only have on letter left to play :p
[13:09:19] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: good game
[13:09:21] <tash> I want to make  POST via ajax. But, I've never done that with jq, can someone help me out?
[13:09:26] <ajpiano> gg :)
[13:09:29] <ajpiano> i just chally'd again
[13:09:38] <ryanneufeld> tash: see ? ajax
[13:09:38] <bot-t> tash, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:09:44] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: k
[13:15:28] <ohcibi> how to find out the path of the current script?
[13:15:44] <Eviltwin> ohcibi: I don't think you can
[13:15:53] <Eviltwin> The JavaScript scope doesn't really work that way
[13:17:24] <ohcibi> hm... so is there a general approach to load additional ressources when just knowing relative paths?
[13:17:52] <Eviltwin> Not relative to the script, no
[13:17:57] <Eviltwin> Relative to the page is easy
[13:18:14] <Eviltwin> And a CSS import is relative to the path of that CSS file
[13:18:24] <Eviltwin> But script works rather differently
[13:23:50] <Spikes> Guys, Opera still doesn't support XHR file uploading?
[13:29:47] <malinens> $('.cut_form :input:visible:first').focus(); it selects correct element but page does not focus on this element but page automatically scrolls to top of the page. Why it happens?
[13:30:20] <Elephant> "Why does this happen"
[13:31:20] <malinens> tnx, mein fuhrer
[13:31:36] <ohcibi> lol
[13:31:53] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: do you have any prefs for templating libs? Underscore/Moustache/Handlebars?
[13:32:06] <ajpiano> i like hbs
[13:32:42] <ryanneufeld> because?
[13:33:23] <ajpiano> more expressive than mustache, no code in templates like underscore
[13:33:39] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:33:40] <ryanneufeld> cool
[13:33:53] <ryanneufeld> would you consider it production ready?
[13:34:07] <ajpiano> yes
[13:34:13] <timwis> Hey guys, how can I send a request to another domain? I don't need to get anything back, so I don't need JSONP
[13:34:21] <timwis> I just need to 'activate my token'
[13:35:07] <Eviltwin> Add a new script with src of that URL?
[13:35:43] <timwis> src of that URL? what do you mean, eviltwin?
[13:36:03] <Eviltwin> What request are you trying to make?
[13:37:04] <ryanneufeld> thx
[13:37:46] <timwis> oh, nevermind, I didn't realise $.ajax() had a separate attribute 'jsonp'. I was just putting ?callback=? in the URL like you do in $.getJSON()
[13:37:50] <timwis> Working now, thanks
[13:39:12] <malinens> oh crap, I forgot to add return false in .click { $input. focus} and that's why I always jumpet to top
[13:40:46] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you're either much better at this than I am, or I'm getting epically shitty racks
[13:40:56] <ryanneufeld> probably both
[13:41:13] <ajpiano> :x
[13:41:38] <de5gravity> hello
[13:41:48] <de5gravity> omg guys please help me with something, i am going nuts
[13:42:03] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: i think the best thing for you to do would be to read http://michael5000.blogspot.com/2007/11/intermediate-scrabble-strategy-helpful.html ;)
[13:42:24] <de5gravity> i somehow feel like that may not help
[13:42:56] <de5gravity> it's a very documented error but i can't find a fix that works for me. it's the good old coda slider / lightbox problem
[13:43:47] <de5gravity> is anyone familiar with those 2?
[13:44:57] <ajpiano> i am decidedly unfamiliar with said problem
[13:45:16] <de5gravity> oh okay
[13:45:42] <de5gravity> ugh it's been driving me nuts for the past day. all those open source plugins conflict with one another
[13:46:06] <de5gravity> and my page has different errors in different browsers and look different o_o
[13:48:03] <de5gravity> do you guys know where i can find help?
[14:21:42] <oojacoboo> so, I have the following code for handling XMLHttpRequest(s) within our app.  http://jsfiddle.net/W8CrY/The current issue is that if you click too fast, a status == 0 is getting triggered throwing the error.
[14:21:49] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/W8CrY/  ^^
[14:22:28] <oojacoboo> The question is, how can I avoid this from happening, is it an onDomReady issue?
[14:24:53] <tarunhari> Hey
[14:24:58] <tarunhari> anyone around?
[14:25:50] <Eviltwin> Why?
[14:26:08] <tarunhari> need some help with some js if anyone has the time?
[14:26:13] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[14:26:14] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:26:46] <tarunhari> need to know how best to make a gallery controller click with my setup...
[14:26:50] <tarunhari> uploading
[14:27:36] <prologic> jquery.ui doesn't support client-side html generation does it? (like ExtJS)?
[14:28:26] <oojacoboo> generation?
[14:28:39] <tarunhari> http://www.tarunhari.co.uk/clients/matthew-price/ - I have the animation set up exactly how I need it and the dots are all moving nice on their own. But now I don't really know how to tackle having a user click the individual dots and have it navigate to the appropriate slide.
[14:29:05] <oojacoboo> tarunhari: set an id on use click()
[14:29:16] <oojacoboo> s/on/and :/
[14:29:48] <prologic> oojacoboo, example, $(foo).dialog(); requires the div element foo to exist on the page right?
[14:30:04] <oojacoboo> prologic: yea, sure
[14:30:09] <prologic> whereas in contrast ExtJS generatoes all of it's own html and css
[14:30:33] <oojacoboo> prologic: I don't understand what you mean by generates here
[14:30:33] <Eviltwin> prologic: Well you can do $("<div/>").appendTo("body").dialog()
[14:30:49] <prologic> yeah sure
[14:30:50] <tarunhari> oojacoboo, can you provide an example? I'm quite new to javascript in general and I've inherited this code.
[14:30:59] <Eviltwin> It's more flexible to be able to use existing elements
[14:31:05] <Eviltwin> Since you can just make the elements
[14:31:15] <prologic> that's a bit of a fart around though :)
[14:31:18] <prologic> but yeah you're right
[14:31:23] <prologic> it's probably a bit more flexible
[14:32:44] <tarunhari> http://jsfiddle.net/UQS6K/ this is my js if anyone can help me out with the click id?
[14:34:12] <Eviltwin> tarunhari: One quick thing: Instead of $($('.web .navigation').children()[webPosCounter]) use $('.web .navigation').children().eq(webPosCounter)
[14:34:36] <oojacoboo> tarunhari: http://pikachoose.com/demo/
[14:34:44] <oojacoboo> maybe that'll help
[14:35:21] <tarunhari> @eviltwin thanks will change that
[14:37:53] <tarunhari> cool, thats much better actually, well spotted.
[14:38:15] <tarunhari> so basically, i guess i just need to put a stop to the animation on click
[14:42:27] <prologic> hmm
[14:42:34] <prologic> I just discovery jQuery.tmpl()
[14:42:35] <prologic> nice
[14:42:52] <Eviltwin> Just as they're dropping it :P
[14:43:04] <prologic> serious?
[14:43:10] <abjorn> ya
[14:43:10] <bot-t> (98 hours 50 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn i dunno ur music lol
[14:43:12] <abjorn> its
[14:43:12] <abjorn> slow
[14:43:24] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky hes homoz
[14:43:25] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[14:46:09] <oojacoboo> no one know on this?  http://jsfiddle.net/W8CrY/
[14:46:26] <oojacoboo> I'm getting an error when triggering events too fast
[14:47:58] <oojacoboo> I get statusText "abort"
[14:48:01] <kanzie> if $.change() doesn't trigger when I manually change the value, what can I do? http://jsfiddle.net/KZ6mE/
[14:49:14] <oojacoboo> kanzie: keyup()?
[14:50:09] <kanzie> oojacoboo: nah, I have a separate place where I collect the input and then I update val(). Right now it seems I have to bind to the "submit"-operation.
[14:51:00] <oojacoboo> kanzie: what's the issue
[14:51:08] <oojacoboo> I thought you were having val issues
[14:51:16] <oojacoboo> evaluating the inputs
[14:52:02] <kanzie> A few inputs of many have values I want to check. and I have a external numpad to enter values. When you enter a value and press "ok" I take the value entered and update val() or the element. I wanted to have a change()-event on the inputs that I update with val()
[14:52:51] <kanzie> now I have to perform a check on every "ok" and if the id that is being manipulated don't have constraints I skip validation.
[14:53:33] <oojacoboo> mmm, not sure l entirely understand
[14:53:47] <oojacoboo> why not use the value or data even to store?
[14:54:21] <kanzie> The constraints that I validate the value to is stored in .data()
[14:54:35] <kanzie> since Ican't fire the change() event I have to check every input
[14:54:40] <kanzie> instead of just the few inputs affected
[14:55:00] <kanzie> if they have a data-attribute, then check, otherwise skip. A workaround but also ok
[14:55:08] <oojacoboo> so, why not assign each one changed a unique class or something
[14:55:28] <kanzie> Now Im curious as to where I would place the data()-values in a MVC-pattern. It should go in the model, but since it affects the view it feels wrong
[14:55:46] <oojacoboo> yea, but it's js
[14:56:03] <kanzie> oojacoboo: yeah, but that's a poor excuse to not follow convention :-)
[14:56:16] <oojacoboo> yea, well, you don't have a choice for client side
[14:56:25] <oojacoboo> unless you want to use html5 datastore
[14:56:41] <kanzie> nah, the DOM is fine
[14:56:48] <kanzie> not enough data to validate datastore
[14:57:03] <oojacoboo> ;)
[15:20:21] <tash> someone linked me earlier to .get() for an explanation of it. But, how do I actually invoke it when someone submits my form? onSubmit?
[15:20:24] <pvivek> I have a table with many <td>something</td> elements . I want to convert all those(something) values to json . Is there any function in jquery which would convert table cell contents into json.
[15:21:59] <pvivek> I am currently able to do this much http://dpaste.org/PEhbO/. Thinkin how to convert it to json . would be glad if someone can help me out
[15:24:31] <doncams> pvivek, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/920930/how-to-create-json-by-javascript-for-loop
[15:39:38] <pvivek> doncams : thank you will check it out
[15:41:36] <tash> I think I'm misunderstaning something.
[15:42:09] <tash> I have a form whose ID is "form".  I am trying to prevent default and do an xhr, but this code isn't working: http://pastie.org/2926130
[15:42:19] <tash> Can someone help me understand what I'm doing wrong?
[15:43:27] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ tash
[15:43:27] <bot-t> tash, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[16:00:32] <ryanneufeld> could try just return false, at the end of your function, instead of the even.preventDefault();
[16:01:12] <ryanneufeld> is your code inside a $(function(){ //docready code });
[16:26:06] <olinux> looking at some examples, can someone explain $.fn.changeType = function(){
[16:26:40] <olinux> that's just creating a custom function "changeType" that's avail from any object
[16:30:49] <JakeSays> so is it true you can't stack modal dialogs?

[17:01:39] <JoeyA> Anyone happen to know of a link that documents the (function($) { ... } (jQuery)); idiom?
[17:02:19] <JoeyA> I know how it works, but I'd rather defer the explanation to somewhere else.
[17:02:28] <JoeyA> (in my source code comment)
[17:04:19] <JoeyA> (It works by taking advantage of lexical scope and closures in JavaScript.  It defines a function that takes an argument $, and immediately passes that function the argument `jQuery`.

[17:33:59] <X-Rob> I don't understand $(this). I'm trying to do $('#click').bind('click', function() { alert( $(this).getAttribute('href'))}) to get the href of a link when it's clicked on.  That doesn't work, because I am only a lowly noob. Can someone enlightne me?
[17:36:32] <X-Rob> dammit. I was close. it's $(this).attr('href')
[17:37:52] <richardr> Has anyone used Cleanslate as an 'aggressive css reset strategy' for JavaScript widgets. Thoughts on it?
[17:52:58] <bl4ckcomb> is there a place where I could place an url to my jQuery plugin project for feedback?
[17:54:36] <maloi> hello, why is $( "#my\\[id\\]" ).val("A"); working but $( "#my[id]".replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\\\$1') ).val("A"); does not?
[17:55:28] <bl4ckcomb> maloi, how is it not working?
[17:55:44] <maloi> first sets the input field to A second one does not
[17:56:20] <v0lksman> hello! I've read that 'return false' should reset an autocomplete field to blank on 'select' but this doesn't seem to work, did I miss something?  http://dpaste.com/662129/
[17:56:22] <maloi> although  "#my[id]".replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\\\$1') gives "#my\\[id\\]" also
[17:56:31] <bl4ckcomb> maloi, you're not matching a group, so you won't have any value for $1
[17:56:41] <maloi> i do
[17:56:46] <maloi> () are there
[17:57:00] <bl4ckcomb> replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\\\$1') <- you don't
[17:57:08] <bl4ckcomb> oh
[17:57:10] <bl4ckcomb> ah
[17:57:13] <bl4ckcomb> my bad
[17:57:23] <bl4ckcomb> well, the group is [ or ]
[17:57:27] <bl4ckcomb> not id
[17:57:42] <bl4ckcomb> if you need id, then match \[(\d+)\]
[17:57:52] <bl4ckcomb> assuming id is an integer
[17:57:56] <maloi> right so [ becomes \\[
[17:58:07] <bl4ckcomb> yes
[17:58:11] <maloi> i want to escape the [
[17:58:21] <bl4ckcomb> you mean with a single \ ?
[17:58:53] <bl4ckcomb> then replace with '\\$1' instead of '\\\\$1'
[17:59:04] <maloi> no $() selects ids with [ or ] in it only if they are escaped like \\[ and \\]
[17:59:41] <maloi> no you have to escape \ aswell so \\ becomes \\\\
[17:59:57] <maloi> or teh other way around
[18:00:26] <maloi> you see my problem?  $( "#my\\[id\\]" ).val("A"); does the right thing
[18:00:36] <maloi> but $( "#my[id]".replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\\\$1') ).val("A"); does not
[18:00:57] <maloi> although  "#my[id]".replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\\\$1') === "#my\\[id\\]"
[18:00:58] <avent> http://jsfiddle.net/eDAqK/     I have a setup where I have a sidebar that shows pictures in small. I am trying to make it so when I click on the small picture, that picture is then displayed in bigger on the left in the main window. I am stuck on the code and can't find the error.
[18:03:38] <avent> any ideas?

[18:11:00] <NickWebHA> I am working on a little experiment for real-time applications using jQuery. I need an AJAX request that stays open for a while (or stays open for ~30 seconds). I already solved the server-side issues of buffers and bhla, bhla, bhla but the client-side (jQuery) AJAX calls will only return data after the connection closes. Any suggestions?
[18:11:04] <maloi> yeah butwhy does that no work?
[18:11:46] <maloi> bl4ckcomb: got it, thank you
[18:12:36] <bl4ckcomb> maloi, how did you fix it? I didn't know of this problem
[18:14:10] <maloi> $( "#my[id]".replace(/([\[\]])/g,'\\$1') ).val("A");
[18:14:18] <maloi> not \\\\$1
[18:14:40] <maloi> i thought i should escape with \\ not just \
[18:15:03] <bl4ckcomb> ah right.. '#my\\[id\\]' is actually #my\[id\]
[18:15:28] <avent> Does anybody have a solution to my problem by any chance?
[18:22:31] <kermitpt> avent
[18:22:47] <kermitpt> you have to pass $(this) to your function (showPic)
[18:22:59] <kermitpt> as a parameter
[18:23:35] <kermitpt> so that you can afterwards find the img inside your a tag...and append it
[18:24:02] <avent> Oh, okay
[18:24:06] <avent> Let me try that out :)
[18:24:09] <maloi> thank you and good night
[18:26:53] <avent> kermitpt: works great! yay. thank you :)

[19:08:07] <tregeagle> can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here: http://paste.debian.net/147154/ or here http://jsfiddle.net/tregeagle/wzFUN/1/ - I'm trying to get part of a class name from the path\
[19:17:56] <poincare101> I wrote this with jquery, mongodb and python in about 2 hours: http://dhaivat.webfactional.com/. Tell me what you think!
[19:18:00] <emelpy> tregeagle: on lines 8 and 9, why do you have the square brackets
[19:18:04] <emelpy> ?
[19:18:47] <tregeagle> no idea, been playing with the syntax .. hang on will try it without
[19:19:16] <crab> is jquery-tmpl still the best thing to use?
[19:20:38] <tregeagle> emelpy: I remember why I did it now, a hangover from something I had been trying. removing them does not fix it though.
[19:21:00] <tregeagle> emelpy: thx anyway :)
[19:25:34] <emelpy> you also need to remove the quotes. $('.myClass-' + path).css('border', '3px dotted green');
[19:25:53] <tregeagle> thanks, will try...
[19:29:12] <emelpy> tregeagle: you'll want to do something like this - http://pastie.org/2926682
[19:30:32] <emelpy> without the click binding your code will only execute on the initial page load
[19:31:37] <tregeagle> emelpy: thanks for your help, that's ok I was not going to use the click event. and I've got it all working now. My shonky syntax
[19:31:54] <emelpy> no problem
[19:31:56] <tregeagle> emelpy ++1 Thanks
[19:32:00] <tregeagle> :)
[19:36:21] <looopy> hi, is there a way to load in partial pages...or a snippet of html from a separate html file?
[19:39:31] <emelpy> looopy: yes, you'll want to use an ajax call ($.get or $.post)
[19:40:39] <looopy> ok, thanks.  i'm used to working with rails and of course we have 'partial' tags... i'd like to be able to do that with my regular pages too without having a lot of clutter in an individual file
[19:42:21] <pmb_> how do i select an elemtn based on its ID and change its width?
[19:43:33] <emelpy> pmb_: $('#element-id').width('100px');
[19:49:41] <pmb_> nice! thanks emelpy
[19:51:21] <emelpy> pmb_: no problem, if you want to change the width based on the current width it would look something like this: $('#element-id').width(($(this).width() + 100) + 'px')
[19:58:41] <pmb_> okay cool thanks
[20:03:50] <pmb_> emelpy you don't know if theres a way to trace() or print() in javascript.. for debugging ?
[20:04:08] <crab> console.log(...)
[20:04:17] <pmb_> where does it output to?
[20:04:28] <crab> the console (e.g. firebug)
[20:05:02] <crab> (i mean, you can see it in firebug, but that's not the only place. i just don't remember what the menu option to display the console is, since i always view it in firebug)
[20:05:35] <thomedy> so im using mouseleave and mouoseenter to create a  fancy tooltip... im trying to make it wait for a sec before it shows so i set it to asettimeout and then also set the animation to an var anim and then in mouse leave said anim.stop
[20:05:42] <thomedy> but its still firing no matter what
[20:05:51] <thomedy> i only want it to fire if im there for a sec
[20:06:03] <thomedy> not fire for sure but wait a sec
[20:07:46] <emelpy> pmb_: along with console.log you could set breakpoints and see current variable values using the javascript console in firebug (both safari and chrome also have built-in debuggers)
[20:08:56] <ndss56> emelpy: FYI IE8+ also have built in debuggers.
[20:12:07] <pmb_> thanks emelpy and crab. that works
[20:33:53] <billwalton> why does...
[20:33:54] <billwalton> $.ajax({
[20:33:56] <billwalton>                   url: 'galleries/new',
[20:33:57] <billwalton>                   success: $("#picture_gallery").addClass('new_class')
[20:33:59] <billwalton>             })
[20:34:01] <billwalton> work
[20:34:12] <billwalton> and why does ...
[20:34:14] <Eviltwin> Why does it work?
[20:34:20] <Eviltwin> Or not work?
[20:34:26] <billwalton> why does this not work...
[20:34:56] <billwalton>  $.ajax({
[20:34:57] <billwalton>                   url: 'galleries/new',
[20:34:59] <billwalton>                   success: function(){$("#picture_gallery").addClass('new_class');}
[20:35:22] <Eviltwin> Okay, you need to stop pasting code directly, use pastebin or something
[20:35:28] <billwalton> missed the ending right paren, but not in the code
[20:35:34] <billwalton> sorry
[20:35:40] <billwalton> stopped
[20:35:55] <billwalton> that's all the code i got to show
[20:35:55] <Eviltwin> The first one will actually run that code before the AJAX runs
[20:36:03] <Eviltwin> The second one will run only if the AJAX is successful
[20:36:14] <Eviltwin> Only once it has responded with a success
[20:36:17] <billwalton> ajax is successful in both cases
[20:36:37] <crab> how can you be sure?
[20:36:42] <billwalton> watching it in firebug, it hits the success  condition
[20:37:05] <billwalton> and worse, i run the code once without the function()...
[20:37:09] <billwalton> works
[20:37:27] <billwalton> mod the code by adding function(){...} wrapper
[20:37:34] <billwalton> refresh page
[20:37:37] <crab> <Eviltwin> The first one will actually run that code before the AJAX runs
[20:37:43] <billwalton>  click the button
[20:37:54] <billwalton> no workie
[20:38:27] <billwalton> @Eviltwin, not sure what you mean.  I watch it run _when_ the ajax runs
[20:39:01] <billwalton> it's inside a function on $(element).change
[20:39:37] <billwalton> though the entire thing is inside the document.ready function

[20:46:47] <billwalton> Eviltwin: i see what that's doing, but it gets me no closer to understanding what the code i pasted above is doing

[20:47:54] <billwalton> Eviltwin: in my case, //Version A is the one that is actually adding the class to the element

[20:52:02] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Also, else if is your firend
[20:52:48] <pmb_> is $(window).width(); reliable?
[20:53:00] <Eviltwin> pmb_: Should be
[20:54:01] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: have you experienced a situation that would lead you to think it is not?
[20:54:39] <pmb_> well i have a grid of images
[20:54:57] <pmb_> and I'm trying to resize the images so they always fill the window
[20:55:11] <ryanneufeld> width: 100%
[20:55:38] <pmb_> hm yeah but they aren't separated into a table
[20:55:46] <pmb_> but thats a good idea maybe i should table them out
[20:55:50] <ryanneufeld> no
[20:55:52] <ryanneufeld> don't do that
[20:55:53] <Eviltwin> What?
[20:55:58] <pmb_> okay
[20:55:59] <ryanneufeld> for the love of god don't use a table
[20:56:01] <pmb_> there are no <br>'s either
[20:56:02] <pmb_> lol
[20:56:09] <pmb_> okay i won't use one
[20:56:20] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: can you get a demo working on jsfiddle.net?
[20:56:21] <Eviltwin> http://shouldiusetablesforlayout.com/
[20:56:39] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin++
[20:57:39] <billwalton> Eviltwin: want to make sure i understand what you're saying...  re: same as ....
[20:58:20] <pmb_> so
[20:58:22] <billwalton> Eviltwin: are you saying that since there are no other conditions tested, i need not even include the success entries?
[20:58:51] <Eviltwin> billwalton: I'm saying that you aren't passing a success function
[20:58:57] <Eviltwin> You are passing code you wanted to run on success
[20:59:15] <Eviltwin> So it's actually run first
[20:59:40] <billwalton> hmmm...
[20:59:54] <billwalton> first before the ajax call is made, you mean
[21:00:01] <Eviltwin> Yes, like I showed
[21:00:14] <Eviltwin> What I wrote is essentially the same as what you wrote
[21:00:15] <pmb_> if you were going to layout a grid of images how would you do it? just <img><img><img><br><img><img><img> etc?
[21:00:25] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: you don't even really need the br
[21:00:33] <Eviltwin> Except that it doesn't then pass that object as a success function
[21:00:34] <pmb_> but if i say width=100% i do
[21:00:42] <pmb_> otherwise they will all just be placed in a row
[21:00:43] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: not really
[21:00:53] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: I'm working on something
[21:01:44] <billwalton> Eviltwin: ok.  but i can see the ajax response in firebug and the data response from the server
[21:02:20] <billwalton> Eviltwin: so ....
[21:02:39] <Eviltwin> Not sure what to say. Can you show us?
[21:03:06] <billwalton> Eviltwin: i'd sure like to.  How best?
[21:03:29] <Eviltwin> Well how are you debugging currently?
[21:03:37] <billwalton> firebug
[21:03:45] <Eviltwin> By going to what URL
[21:03:59] <billwalton> local server
[21:04:28] <Eviltwin> So if you go to the galleries/new relative path, what happens?
[21:04:45] <billwalton> hold one
[21:06:01] <billwalton> hmmm
[21:06:14] <billwalton> just got a 304 Not Modified
[21:06:18] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/z9jQb/4/
[21:06:33] <billwalton> that wouldn't be a 'success' i don't think
[21:06:42] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: yes
[21:06:45] <ryanneufeld> 304 is success
[21:06:57] <billwalton> ok
[21:07:06] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Add an error callback
[21:07:07] <Eviltwin> Just to see
[21:07:10] <Eviltwin> Or a complete callback
[21:07:59] <pmb_> okay so
[21:08:02] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: check it out. By using a percentage, you can have fluid widths for your images, you don't need breaks. By setting the % on the wrapper, and setting all images to 100% you don't have to calculate the sizes
[21:08:16] <pmb_> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/z9jQb/4/
[21:08:23] <pmb_> see how sometimes theres a white bar on the right?
[21:08:33] <billwalton> https://gist.github.com/1396968
[21:08:36] <pmb_> its not totally filling
[21:08:46] <billwalton> that was the code just executed
[21:09:06] <billwalton> and the class on "#picture_gallery" is being toggled
[21:09:19] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: that's probably due to scrollbars
[21:09:32] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/z9jQb/6/show/
[21:09:53] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I only see the white bar when I have scrollbars
[21:09:59] <pmb_> I'm still single single pixel spaces
[21:10:00] <billwalton> Eviltwin: the "item_gallery_id" element is a select
[21:10:09] <pmb_> 1 or 2 pixels of space
[21:10:14] <pmb_> on the far right
[21:10:20] <ryanneufeld> what browser are you using?
[21:10:22] <pmb_> you don't se eit?
[21:10:24] <pmb_> chrome
[21:10:26] <ryanneufeld> no, I don't
[21:10:29] <ryanneufeld> at all
[21:10:51] <billwalton> Eviltwin: the first 2 elements have id's of -1 and 0
[21:10:52] <ryanneufeld> are you sure it's not the browser chrome you're seeing
[21:11:32] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: okay, I do see it
[21:11:41] <ryanneufeld> at different window sizes
[21:11:42] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Instead of all of this clutter, try running $.ajax({url:"galleries/new",success:function(){console.log("Success!")},error:function(){console.log("Error!")}});
[21:11:46] <pmb_> yes
[21:11:48] <pmb_> thats what i mean
[21:11:51] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: I don't think you can do anything about that
[21:11:52] <pmb_> so check it out
[21:11:59] <pmb_> i must do something about it
[21:12:07] <ryanneufeld> why?
[21:12:10] <pmb_> because i hate it
[21:12:18] <ryanneufeld> don't be so anal
[21:12:25] <pmb_> i am
[21:13:12] <ryanneufeld> doesn't happen in FF
[21:13:24] <ryanneufeld> I'm on a mac, so I can't check IE
[21:14:09] <pmb_> I'm seeing line between the images in FF
[21:14:18] <pmb_> when i resize
[21:14:26] <ryanneufeld> so here's the thing
[21:14:38] <ryanneufeld> what do you want it to do when it has an odd number of pixels?
[21:14:43] <pmb_> so check it out
[21:14:48] <ryanneufeld> and an even number of images?
[21:14:49] <pmb_> on my thing
[21:14:53] <billwalton> https://gist.github.com/1397004
[21:14:53] <pmb_> its 24 images
[21:14:55] <pmb_> 6 on each row
[21:15:13] <billwalton> Eviltwin: changed and pasted the code above
[21:15:22] <pmb_> so I'm taking 		var thumbRemainder = (contentwidth/thumbsPerRow - thumbWidth)*thumbsPerRow;
[21:15:28] <billwalton> added a failure clause
[21:15:34] <pmb_> I'm adding that thumb remainder onto th width of the first image in the row
[21:15:46] <billwalton> Eviltwin: neither fire
[21:15:54] <pmb_> and mathematically it adds up and its perfect
[21:15:54] <ryanneufeld> pmb_: that's retarded
[21:15:59] <pmb_> but the browser breaks
[21:16:03] <pmb_> why is it retarded?
[21:16:18] <ryanneufeld> because you're obsessing over something no one is going to notice
[21:16:26] <ryanneufeld> you're dealing with percentage widths
[21:16:29] <ryanneufeld> and pixels
[21:16:30] <pmb_> it matters to me though
[21:16:34] <ryanneufeld> can only be whole numbers
[21:16:38] <pmb_> i know
[21:16:51] <pmb_> the browser width can only be whole numbers too
[21:16:59] <ryanneufeld> that's right
[21:17:08] <pmb_> so theres no percentage if I'm setting each image manually
[21:17:09] <ryanneufeld> but they can be even or od
[21:17:18] <ryanneufeld> which again, is stupid
[21:17:31] <pmb_> idk i don't see why its stupid
[21:17:37] <pmb_> I'm trying to achieve a certain look
[21:17:42] <pmb_> and i don't want it to look like shit
[21:17:47] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't
[21:17:47] <pmb_> so I'm trying things to make sure it doesnt
[21:18:57] <ryanneufeld> you're being obsessive over minute details that no one will notice.  Also aesthetically, it's better to have some space between images.
[21:19:30] <pmb_> blah it depends what you're doing
[21:19:30] <pmb_> f
[21:19:36] <pmb_> i don't want spaces for this particular thing I'm making
[21:19:55] <ryanneufeld> so you're gonna run JS on every resize event?
[21:20:01] <pmb_> i already do
[21:20:02] <pmb_> yes
[21:20:08] <pmb_> but still having trouble
[21:20:09] <ryanneufeld> how often are your users resizing their windows
[21:20:10] <ryanneufeld> ?
[21:20:31] <pmb_> I'm not sure yet this is not something thats live yet
[21:20:43] <pmb_> so basically i have it resizing perfectly
[21:20:44] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[21:20:45] <ryanneufeld> I see
[21:20:48] <pmb_> theres not a single pixel of blank space
[21:20:56] <pmb_> but sometimes you resize and it breaks the layout
[21:21:02] <pmb_> like its showing 5 per row instead of 6
[21:21:03] <ryanneufeld> OH NOES NOT A PIXEL!!!
[21:21:07] <pmb_> lol
[21:21:36] <pmb_> but anyways
[21:21:51] <pmb_> I'm console.logging the size of each img and the cotentwidth
[21:21:54] <pmb_> and it should fit
[21:21:59] <pmb_> but for some reason it doesnt
[21:22:40] <ryanneufeld> sorry man, I think your being silly, so I don't really want to help you anymore
[21:22:41] <billwalton> Eviltwin: you got time to take a look at the 2 gists and help me understand wtf i'm doing wrong here?
[21:22:59] <billwalton> Eviltwin: i'm lost
[21:23:12] <progrock`> Just strated mesing around with modernizer (I didnt realize there was such extensive polyfills)... theres a lot of overlap... can someone recommend a god one for CSS3 cross broswer support.. I saw CCS3 Pie as well ass cssfx, among others, anyone got a favorite?>
[21:23:45] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: ask in #html5 or #css
[21:23:49] <billwalton> Eviltwin: the code in the gist is in the document.ready function to bind the select element onchange function
[21:24:03] <pmb_> its okay. i just care a lot about my UX lol i guess its pretty obsessive
[21:24:07] <pmb_> i appreciate the help though ryanneufeld
[21:24:32] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: there is caring and there is being stupid about it. You've crossed the line from caring.
[21:24:47] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: not you. pmb_
[21:26:37] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: Eviltwin seems to have dropped off on me.  Could you take a look at the 2 gists and tell me why the one using a function doesn't work?
[21:26:52] <progrock`> ryanneufeld: lo, would hope not
[21:27:07] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: yeah sorry he left before my tab-completion got his name :p
[21:27:08] <billwalton> I'm hoping it's something schtupit
[21:27:31] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: I have a low tolerance for stupid tonight... I'll do my best
[21:27:39] <billwalton> ;-)
[21:27:44] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: wher
[21:27:47] <ryanneufeld> is your jist?
[21:27:50] <ryanneufeld> gist
[21:27:51] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[21:27:54] <billwalton> one sec
[21:28:14] <progrock`> well I dont have astupid question, just trying to se whats peopels preference, haha.. I have no experience using them, and they overlap quite a bit
[21:28:22] <billwalton> https://gist.github.com/1396968
[21:28:27] <billwalton> that one works
[21:28:28] <progrock`> and instead oftrial and error, would like to hear from someone who has already tried ;)
[21:28:51] <billwalton> https://gist.github.com/1397004
[21:28:57] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: just use the html 5 polyfill with modernizr and you'll be fine
[21:28:58] <billwalton> that one does not
[21:29:21] <ryanneufeld> don't worry about css3 pollyfils, things don't (and some just will never) look the same in all browsers
[21:29:39] <amh345> anyone know what effect/plugin achieve what tumblr does when you click on "30 reasons you'll love tumblr"? https://www.tumblr.com/
[21:29:58] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: yeah, you kinda can't do:  context: $("#picture_gallery"),
[21:30:17] <progrock`> ryanneufeld: yeah, not trying to get them to look the same, just trying to get a soid base amd get at least resonale support in ie7+
[21:30:34] <ryanneufeld> amh345: animated scrollTop could so something like that see ?animate
[21:30:34] <bot-t> amh345, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[21:30:50] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: you can't add support for css, it's there or it's not
[21:30:56] <amh345> ryanneufeld: thank you
[21:31:09] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: yeah, you kinda can't do:  context: $("#picture_gallery"),
[21:31:10] <billwalton> ryanneufeld:  yeah, i figured out that wasn't working like the docs say it works
[21:31:27] <ryanneufeld> the docs don't show it being used like that at all
[21:31:27] <progrock`> ryanneufeld:I know that much.. but some of these polyfills seem pretty solid on what they add
[21:31:39] <billwalton> hold one
[21:31:44] <ryanneufeld> hold ON
[21:32:04] <billwalton> one
[21:32:05] <ryanneufeld> progrock`: the best you should expect is some js for animations, and added element support in IE
[21:32:11] <billwalton> contextObject
[21:32:13] <ryanneufeld> hold one of what?
[21:32:13] <billwalton> This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks. By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax). For example specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for the complete callback of a request, like so:
[21:32:15] <billwalton> $.ajax({
[21:32:16] <billwalton>   url: "test.html",
[21:32:18] <billwalton>   context: document.body,
[21:32:19] <billwalton>   success: function(){
[21:32:21] <billwalton>     $(this).addClass("done");
[21:32:22] <billwalton>   }
[21:32:24] <billwalton> });
[21:32:26] <billwalton> one sec ;-)
[21:32:27] <progrock`> billwalton: WTF?
[21:32:46] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: right, again, it does NOT show using it the way you are
[21:32:49] <billwalton> sorry.  should have pasted that to a gist
[21:32:54] <ryanneufeld> you just proved my point
[21:33:01] <progrock`> ryanneufeld: well css3 pie claims to add roudned corners, drop shadow, gradients.... that alone is a huge plus
[21:33:06] <billwalton> how so?
[21:33:17] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: read what you just pasted
[21:33:28] <ryanneufeld> they wrap their jquery calls in a function
[21:33:28] <ryanneufeld> you'
[21:33:32] <ryanneufeld> are not doing that
[21:33:33] <billwalton> "specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for the complete callback of a request"
[21:33:35] <ryanneufeld> you have to
[21:33:52] <ryanneufeld> context is irrelevant to your problem
[21:33:57] <billwalton> true
[21:34:14] <ryanneufeld> lines 22 and 23 of your Gist are wrong
[21:34:17] <billwalton> that's where i was headed before i ran into this problem
[21:34:33] <ryanneufeld> lines 9 and 10 are a correct way of doing it
[21:34:58] <billwalton> lines 9 and 10, and 16 and 17, are not working
[21:35:18] <billwalton> that's my problem
[21:35:19] <ryanneufeld> because 22 and 23 are wrong
[21:35:28] <billwalton> i do not understand why they are not working
[21:35:37] <ryanneufeld> I just told you
[21:35:52] <billwalton> i'm sorry...
[21:36:01] <ryanneufeld> lines 22 and 23 of your Gist are wrong
[21:36:04] <ryanneufeld> lines 9 and 10 are a correct way of doing it
[21:36:22] <billwalton> they're not working because of line 22 ?
[21:36:29] <ryanneufeld> you can't pass a jquery collection as a function
[21:36:46] <tp43> I wanna submit a form using jquery without resorting to document.href
[21:36:49] <ryanneufeld> even if that isn't the reason, they are still wrong
[21:37:12] <billwalton> ok.  let me take line 22 out and try again
[21:37:25] <ryanneufeld> and 23
[21:37:41] <ryanneufeld> also, you're repeating the same ajax call in your code
[21:37:44] <ryanneufeld> that's silly
[21:37:46] <tp43> I gave my form a id <form id='namedIt'> and then using a selector, I trued $('#namedIT').submit(); but it didn't work
[21:38:10] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: if(choice <=0)
[21:38:43] <ryanneufeld> tp43: calling submit doesn't call the native browser submit
[21:39:00] <ryanneufeld> tp43: try: $('#namedIT').get(0).submit()
[21:39:07] <tp43> hmm, I thought it does from the jquery submit() doc
[21:39:08] <ryanneufeld> tp43: I'm guessing at thatone
[21:39:25] <ryanneufeld> tp43: have you checked your error console?
[21:39:28] <tp43> what is get(0_
[21:39:33] <ryanneufeld> ?get
[21:39:33] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[21:39:52] <ryanneufeld> also did you copy and paste your code here, or type it out?
[21:40:05] <tp43> typed it out
[21:40:23] <tp43> <form id='editable-header-form' | $('#editable-header-form').submit();
[21:40:30] <tp43> My selector is working
[21:40:41] <ryanneufeld> tp43: just checking the obvious first
[21:41:01] <tp43> ryanneufeld, ok, let me post it up on jsfiddle and I will come back in a few moments
[21:41:05] <ryanneufeld> k
[21:41:58] <tp43> http://jsfiddle.net/qqFYE/
[21:42:23] <ryanneufeld> ewwww
[21:42:27] <ryanneufeld> submit on blur?
[21:42:49] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: https://gist.github.com/1397035
[21:43:10] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: modified per your suggestion
[21:43:21] <ryanneufeld> that wasn't my suggestion
[21:43:25] <ryanneufeld> that was your idea
[21:43:34] <ryanneufeld> I just told you those lines were wrong
[21:43:55] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: your first if statement should be if(choice <=0)
[21:43:57] <tp43> ryanneufeld, yeah, i need to setup submit on blur
[21:44:08] <ryanneufeld> tp43: that's just wrong
[21:44:19] <tp43> why?
[21:44:23] <ryanneufeld> so as soon as I defocus a form element
[21:44:32] <ryanneufeld> it's gonna refresh the page
[21:44:33] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: the item_gallery_id field is a select
[21:44:47] <tp43> ryanneufeld, exactly, that what i am trying to achieve here
[21:44:49] <billwalton> the ids are irrelevant in this case
[21:45:04] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: your first if statement should be if(choice <=0) then you don't need the if(choice ==0) in the else
[21:45:41] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: there are 2 choices in the select that are not records to be selected
[21:46:01] <ryanneufeld> tp43: I'll be honest, I think that's a terrible user experience, so I don't want to help you make the web shittier by helping you
[21:46:05] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: so i've given those choices ids of -1 and 0
[21:46:34] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: but you make the SAME ajax call regardless of if it's <0 or ==0
[21:46:46] <ryanneufeld> ?DRY
[21:46:46] <bot-t> DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. http://goo.gl/xwCA
[21:46:59] <tp43> the blur line is working but the submit() isn't refreshing the page
[21:47:35] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: in the real code the <0 choice will simply return false and not submit to the server
[21:47:40] <tp43> ryanneufeld, you have no idea what the purpose is, so you are not in a position to judge the experience, it is for creating editable pages
[21:48:13] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: 0 will submit to new: >0 will submit to show
[21:48:26] <ryanneufeld> tp43: that's a shitty experience in my opinion. If you want it to save, then have a timeout
[21:48:32] <ryanneufeld> with a save button
[21:48:58] <tp43> ryanneufeld, its like a comment box, so when people leave a comment to change saves to file it people will expect it to save auto
[21:49:00] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: the code as it sits just lets me toggle the classes so i can try to tell wtf is going wrong
[21:49:11] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: oic
[21:49:20] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: have you inspected your xhrs
[21:49:23] <ryanneufeld> ?
[21:49:29] <tp43> ryanneufeld, if you don't know how thats one thing
[21:49:40] <tp43> ryanneufeld, let someone else try instead of knocking it
[21:49:57] <ryanneufeld> tp43: I know how, I just don'
[21:50:12] <ryanneufeld> don't want to help you build something that is a terrible idea
[21:50:15] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: if i understand correctly, i have to get the function working in order to get at the xhr, yes?
[21:50:30] <billwalton> and the function is what is not working
[21:50:33] <tp43> ryanneufeld, its fine,, I would appreciate if you keep quite about it and let someone else try instead of insulting my work that you know very little about
[21:51:37] <tp43> who talks like that...Oh your idea stupid, I know the solution but I am not helping you as if.  I'd just shutup if I were you instead of acting like a jerk
[21:52:19] <ryanneufeld> how big is this project you're working on?
[21:53:02] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: whom are you addressing?
[21:53:19] <ryanneufeld> tp43: I'm not acting, and I told you it's not personal.
[21:53:48] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: I'm gonna take a closer look
[21:54:06] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I had to go take care of something
[21:54:11] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: i appreciate it.
[21:54:19] <tp43> ryanneufeld, I thought I asked you to shutup, personnally, I think you are an idiot based on your response, so there you go, i will call you an idiot instead of keeping it to myself
[21:54:47] <ryanneufeld> tp43: this is an open forum, if you don't like what i have to say, don't feel obligated to respond.
[21:55:00] <ryanneufeld> tp43: you're not entitled to anything
[21:55:03] <tp43> ryanneufeld, exactly
[21:55:06] <Eviltwin> Sounds like I came in in the middle of something
[21:55:31] <tp43> ryanneufeld, do not feel obligated and keep you insults to yourself
[21:55:38] <billwalton> Eviltwin: something that's about over, i hope
[21:55:52] <billwalton> Eviltwin:  since you're back...
[21:56:11] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: tp43 is just throwing a tantrum cause I don't like his idea, and told him so :p
[21:56:21] <billwalton> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/1397035 does not modify the classes on the element
[21:56:56] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: what is your ajax returning?
[21:57:07] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: what's the datatype?
[21:57:21] <tp43> ryanneufeld is throwing tantrum cause he can't whip submit form function much less a little ajax.  Keep training ryanneufeld you will get there Daniel son
[21:57:46] <ryanneufeld> oh son
[21:58:28] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: What is type of data does your ajax call return for you?
[21:58:44] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: Accept in the request is text/javascript
[21:58:48] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Are any exceptions happening?
[21:59:05] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: no no
[21:59:07] <billwalton> Eviltwin: not that I can see in the FF console
[21:59:23] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: ?
[21:59:24] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: galleries/new what does that output?
[21:59:30] <ryanneufeld> html?
[21:59:31] <ryanneufeld> json?
[21:59:37] <ryanneufeld> pixie dust?
[21:59:45] <billwalton> text
[21:59:51] <ryanneufeld> okay
[21:59:55] <ryanneufeld> so when you open up firebug
[21:59:59] <billwalton> keeping it simple atm
[22:00:04] <ryanneufeld> can you see the text in the XHR request?
[22:00:57] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: text in the request?
[22:01:08] <billwalton> it's a get to a url
[22:01:25] <billwalton> the request returns a piece of text
[22:01:34] <billwalton> "server"
[22:01:51] <ryanneufeld> okay
[22:01:56] <billwalton> that's what the Response tab shows, as expected
[22:02:00] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Try throwing an alert in the success or error
[22:02:00] <ryanneufeld> great
[22:02:06] <ryanneufeld> ?alert
[22:02:07] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[22:02:30] <ryanneufeld> alert is terrible for debugging ajax as it is blocking
[22:02:40] <billwalton> Eviltwin: tried that.  didn't fire.
[22:02:51] <billwalton> happy to  try again though
[22:03:30] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I can't count the number of times someone I've been helping has said "it didn't run" or "it doesn't work" because they missed a console.log message
[22:03:44] <Eviltwin> It's much harder for them to miss an alert
[22:04:04] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Also try adding an alert/log right before the $.ajax calls
[22:04:11] <ryanneufeld> but then you get "it works when I put the alert in, but when i take it out it stops"
[22:04:39] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: That's when I tell them it's their fault
[22:04:51] <ryanneufeld> it's always their fault
[22:04:53] <ryanneufeld> lol
[22:04:57] <billwalton> https://gist.github.com/1397067
[22:04:59] <Eviltwin> Every once in a while it's not
[22:05:36] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Okay, right before each $.ajax (inside the if blocks) also add an alert
[22:05:45] <Eviltwin> I want to make sure that's running
[22:06:08] <billwalton> Eviltwin:  will do.  no-workie as is.  no alerts.
[22:06:45] <billwalton> Eviltwin: actually....
[22:07:15] <Eviltwin> Did I call it or what?
[22:07:16] <Eviltwin> :P
[22:07:44] <billwalton> Eviltwin: not what i meant.  this is in document.ready(...
[22:08:03] <billwalton> binding the onchange on the select element
[22:08:09] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: you mean $(document).ready(
[22:08:11] <ryanneufeld> right?
[22:08:14] <billwalton> yes
[22:08:16] <ryanneufeld> k
[22:08:28] <billwalton> $(function() {
[22:08:53] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: yeah
[22:09:15] <billwalton> if I put an alert in prior to the $(ajax....  won't that fire on document ready?
[22:09:26] <ryanneufeld> no
[22:09:33] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: can you paste all your code into a fiddle?
[22:09:37] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/y36m6/1/
[22:09:50] <billwalton> absolutely
[22:10:00] <ryanneufeld> I'm wondering if there is something else being missed
[22:11:12] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: i pasted it in
[22:11:14] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Try something like this: https://gist.github.com/962466f049cd95180ef9
[22:11:25] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: did you click update?
[22:11:39] <billwalton> there
[22:12:16] <ryanneufeld> link?
[22:12:23] <ryanneufeld> it updates the url when you save ;)
[22:12:33] <Eviltwin> Versioning
[22:12:44] <billwalton> sorry.  https://gist.github.com/962466f049cd95180ef9
[22:13:01] <billwalton> oops
[22:13:19] <billwalton> http://jsfiddle.net/y36m6/2/
[22:14:25] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: why the beforeSend?
[22:15:01] <amh345> is there a reason my button won't scroll a div to the top of a page? http://jsfiddle.net/49b4j/
[22:15:17] <ryanneufeld> amh345: yup
[22:15:28] <ryanneufeld> amh345: uses $('html,body').animate
[22:15:30] <amh345> heh. that was the fastest response ever!
[22:15:31] <ryanneufeld> *use
[22:15:34] <amh345> oh
[22:15:42] <ryanneufeld> amh345: I just had to write that at work :p
[22:15:53] <ryanneufeld> fresh in my mind
[22:15:55] <ryanneufeld> :P
[22:16:06] <ryanneufeld> tp43: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2718799/unable-to-submit-an-html-form-after-intercepting-the-submit-with-javascript
[22:16:24] <ryanneufeld> tp43: if you had checked your console like I suggested, you'd have found that there were errors
[22:16:31] <amh345> ryanneufeld: i might be missing something then.   how does html,body relate to the actual div i want to move?
[22:16:43] <amh345> 	  $('html,body').animate({})?
[22:16:48] <ryanneufeld> amh345: well you don't move the div
[22:16:55] <ryanneufeld> you move the page to the top of the div
[22:17:09] <Eviltwin> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/49b4j/1/
[22:17:16] <ryanneufeld> so you need to get the offset.top from your div
[22:17:35] <amh345> Eviltwin: that didn't change anything?
[22:17:50] <Eviltwin> My bad: http://jsfiddle.net/y36m6/2/
[22:17:54] <amh345> ryanneufeld: is that the way moving a div to the top of the page effect is achieved?
[22:18:16] <Eviltwin> Wait
[22:18:19] <Eviltwin> I was right the first time
[22:18:30] <Eviltwin> Scroll the div
[22:18:48] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: not if you want it to work x-browser
[22:19:02] <amh345> Eviltwin: I'm trying to get the div to the top of the page when the button is clicked.  kind of like whats done on tumble.com when the bottom link is clicked.
[22:19:12] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I thought his goal was to scroll a div, not a page
[22:19:14] <amh345> tumblr.com
[22:19:20] <ryanneufeld> amh345: do you care if that is a scroll
[22:19:38] <amh345> i would like it to scroll up. just like this https://www.tumblr.com/
[22:19:48] <Eviltwin> Perhaps animate scrollTop to $(div).position().top
[22:19:49] <ryanneufeld> amh345: yeah, that's not a scroll, sorry
[22:19:51] <ryanneufeld> my bad
[22:19:52] <Eviltwin> Or $(div).offset().top
[22:19:55] <amh345> the "30 reasons whyâ€¦" link at the bottom
[22:20:43] <Eviltwin> It's actually not scrolling
[22:20:48] <Eviltwin> Bar's still at the top
[22:20:53] <ryanneufeld> amh345: that's actually a huge accordian
[22:20:57] <Eviltwin> Try to scroll back up
[22:21:13] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: I told him it was the scrolly thing
[22:21:16] <ryanneufeld> my bad
[22:21:17] <amh345> yeah, i can't.  it's what id like to accomplish
[22:21:22] <Eviltwin> Also, if you want to see something really cool, scale the window up and down
[22:21:27] <ryanneufeld> amh345: what you want is an accordian
[22:21:50] <Eviltwin> The fields actually rearrange themselves
[22:22:16] <amh345> heh. the fields too rearrange. pretty cool
[22:22:26] <amh345> is there a go-to spot for accordions?
[22:22:31] <amh345> accordians *
[22:22:42] <ryanneufeld> jquery-ui
[22:22:46] <ryanneufeld> jqueryui.com
[22:22:55] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[22:23:12] <amh345> ah ha!  that looks like it.
[22:23:13] <amh345> thank you
[22:23:23] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: if tp43 decides he still wants help, tell him
[22:23:27] <ryanneufeld> to check his console
[22:24:05] <ryanneufeld> and read this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2718799/unable-to-submit-an-html-form-after-intercepting-the-submit-with-javascript
[22:24:50] <ryanneufeld> I'm off for the night
[22:24:52] <ryanneufeld> have a good one
[22:24:58] <ryanneufeld> billwalton: good luck
[22:28:02] <tp43> ryanseddon, well you did tell me about .get(0). which was why it wasn't working so...thanks for that tidbit
[22:28:24] <tp43> onblur='document.forms[0].submit()'
[22:28:39] <Eviltwin> tp43: Do you have a jsFiddle or something?
[22:28:48] <billwalton> ryanneufeld: thanks
[22:28:51] <tp43> Eviltwin, I just posted it
[22:29:19] <tp43> Eviltwin, All I was looking for was: onblur='document.forms[0].submit()'
[22:30:24] <tp43> Eviltwin, but the dude was like...'I am the protector of web pages and internet, I cannot help you for it may be detriment to the www universe'...lol
[22:30:58] <Eviltwin> Well that code you've written isn't particularly flexible
[22:31:05] <Eviltwin> If another form is added above, it'll cause problems
[22:31:08] <Eviltwin> For one
[22:31:17] <Eviltwin> If it does what you need it to do, fine
[22:31:24] <tp43> Eviltwin, true
[22:31:28] <Eviltwin> But be aware that while there are many ways to do things, they have different ups and downs
[22:32:30] <tp43> oh man...you going yoda on me too now...ok Mr Miagi wax on wax off
[22:33:11] <Eviltwin> tp43: I think I'm starting to see why ryanneufeld got annoyed :P
[22:34:19] <tp43> eew, you are another yoda
[22:35:22] <Eviltwin> Well at least it won't affect me if your web code doesn't work
[22:37:00] <tp43> just a couple of bullies
[22:41:28] <Sabixkl> i need help
[22:52:23] <tp43> supposed to just ask the question, so if people know the answer they will reply, otherwise they won't
[22:53:14] <billwalton> tp43: that to me?
[22:53:30] <billwalton> tp43: if so....
[22:53:46] <tp43> billwalton, no, Sabixkl, but he left
[22:53:56] <tp43> if so ...boot?
[22:54:04] <billwalton> I'll ask anyway...
[22:54:39] <tp43> but yeah, in general, that is the preferred irc edicate
[22:54:45] <billwalton> is the success condition in an ajax request supposed to respond to a 304?
[23:30:04] <Sabixkl> help I'm using jqgrid with jquery and i'm getting 'undefined' errors please refer to http://pastebin.com/dCzgZgMf
[23:30:13] <Sabixkl> I have the problem area commented
[23:30:54] <Sabixkl> line 9 has the alert() call printing the results
[23:31:26] <Sabixkl> ddid is undefined but the others from the same calls yield the correct result
[23:35:51] <Sabixkl> help??
[23:35:53] <Sabixkl> help?
[23:35:56] <Sabixkl> hellp?
