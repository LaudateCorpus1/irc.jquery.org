[00:35:19] <Uhkis> :D
[00:56:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:53:10] <znf> I need to create a longer-ish table from a json response, what's the best way to do this?
[16:11:15] <\Kalascus> .after() doesn't assume its parameter is a DOM element, like .insertAfter(), does it?
[16:28:50] <shoky> docs are pretty explicit about that
[16:29:18] <shoky> neither assumes its a DOM element
[17:03:21] <Northwoods> https://url.hashdev.org/25
[17:03:56] <Northwoods>  $(".invee").on('change', function() {   , this selector doesn't pick it up
[18:15:40] <Northwoods> hello all
[18:15:41] <Northwoods> how are you
[18:15:46] <Northwoods> https://url.hashdev.org/25
[18:15:46] <Northwoods> <Northwoods>  $(".invee").on('change', function() {   , this selector doesn't pick it up
[18:22:30] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't pick it up"?
[18:22:46] <robertmaxrees> you mean the event handler isn't firing?
[18:23:13] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods
[18:23:58] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, yes
[18:24:12] <robertmaxrees> i can make a jsfiddle and that'll work so without more information, it's hard to help :)
[18:24:21] <Northwoods> :)
[18:24:27] <Northwoods> ok let me create a fiddle
[18:24:38] <robertmaxrees> also: stick to asking questions in one channel at a time.
[18:25:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll get multiple opinions from multiple sources, and sometimes those will conflict.  really counterproductive.,
[18:32:51] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, right
[18:33:06] <Northwoods> you know what , i created fiddle and it is working --> https://jsfiddle.net/jdfn1zsm/
[18:33:08] <Northwoods> it is insane
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> your other paste said something about "THIS GETS CONVERTED TO" - what does that mean?
[18:36:00] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, actually toggle library re-constructs the html
[18:36:14] <Northwoods> https://url.hashdev.org/25
[18:36:23] <Northwoods> here you can see it re-constructs the html
[18:36:26] <Northwoods> on the go
[18:36:30] <robertmaxrees> what does "re-constructs" mean?
[18:36:39] <Northwoods> it embeds its own elements
[18:36:43] <Northwoods> into html
[18:36:45] <robertmaxrees> client-side?
[18:36:46] <Northwoods> on the fly
[18:36:48] <Northwoods> yes
[18:36:52] <Northwoods> client-side
[18:36:52] <robertmaxrees> that's probably why.
[18:36:57] <robertmaxrees> the input is likely getting replacted.
[18:37:01] <robertmaxrees> *replaced.
[18:37:09] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated event listener instead.
[18:37:11] <Northwoods> though its not replaced , but it gets some parents
[18:37:16] <Northwoods> ok
[18:37:23] <robertmaxrees> lol it's very likely getting fully replaced.
[18:37:29] <Northwoods> lol
[18:37:30] <Northwoods> :)
[18:37:32] <Northwoods> could be
[18:37:40] <robertmaxrees> *probably ;)
[18:37:50] <robertmaxrees> if your event listener doesn't work, that is your most likely culprit.
[18:37:52] <Northwoods> agree :)
[19:51:55] <Northwoods> https://jsfiddle.net/a54h7cd6/
[19:51:59] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, same issue
[19:52:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:52:36] <Northwoods> clicking on yes and no
[19:52:38] <robertmaxrees> can you at least put the js in the box for js?
[19:52:39] <Northwoods> doesn't trigger
[19:52:46] <Northwoods> oh sorry
[19:52:47] <Northwoods> ok
[19:52:59] <robertmaxrees> and/or try to make this as minimal as possible? heh
[19:53:24] <robertmaxrees> bunch of links to assets that don't exist and whatnot :)
[19:54:47] <robertmaxrees> also: should avoid using html comments in your js :)
[19:56:13] <Northwoods> https://jsfiddle.net/pg6d1eso/
[19:56:19] <Northwoods> still rough though
[19:56:26] <Northwoods> but js separate
[19:56:44] <Northwoods> the link column doesn't trigger
[19:56:56] <robertmaxrees> lol <script> tags don't go in css and js boxes.  does this actually show the bug happening?
[19:57:55] <Northwoods> lol
[19:57:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - liking 1000 lines of html, css, and js and saying "this one button doesn't work" while the fiddle seemingly doesn't actually replicate the bug...
[19:58:08] <robertmaxrees> like, not sure how to help ya heh
[19:58:28] <robertmaxrees> is the issue the "link" toggle button?
[19:58:31] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, actually included all since  i thought other js might be interfering
[19:58:35] <Northwoods> yes
[19:58:38] <Northwoods> thats the issue
[19:58:48] <Northwoods> link toggle button doesn't trigger
[19:58:53] <robertmaxrees> you realize that none of the other scripts are actually included in the fiddle, right?
[19:59:08] <Northwoods> oh yes , i think they are on local host
[19:59:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:59:22] <robertmaxrees> so let's back WAAAAY up and actually make this a test case.
[19:59:45] <Northwoods> let me remove those as well
[20:00:01] <robertmaxrees> like, remove everything but the stuff related to the bug.
[20:00:14] <robertmaxrees> just have the button and the relevant js and css.
[20:00:40] <robertmaxrees> if the bug goes away with just those, then you have a conflict with another js file.  add them one by one until the bug comes back.
[20:00:45] <robertmaxrees> then you've found your issue.
[20:02:20] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, ok
[20:06:55] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, Here is minimalist version --> https://jsfiddle.net/pg6d1eso/1/
[20:06:59] <Northwoods> and it doesn't seem to be working
[20:08:52] <robertmaxrees> fyi: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ty836xo1/1/
[20:09:03] <robertmaxrees> use the "resources" box on the left to link in css and js files :)
[20:10:10] <Northwoods> :)
[20:10:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ty836xo1/4/ this is literally all you needed to do to create the test case :)
[20:10:31] <robertmaxrees> so what happened with the delegated listener?
[20:11:29] <Northwoods> delegated listener gave me an error in console
[20:11:41] <robertmaxrees> so then why didn't you mention that? :)
[20:11:42] <Northwoods> something liek main not mapped
[20:11:52] <robertmaxrees> also: what's not the right way to do delegation these days.
[20:12:46] <Northwoods> yes i thought may be not compatible with my other js's
[20:12:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:13:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange assumption.  why do you think that?
[20:13:43] <Northwoods> cuz the error was strange
[20:13:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:13:58] <Northwoods> lol
[20:14:01] <robertmaxrees> should've asked about that error then dudeski.
[20:14:16] <robertmaxrees> so let's check the docs for this tool.
[20:14:19] <robertmaxrees> https://www.bootstraptoggle.com/#events
[20:14:21] <Northwoods> yeah , but  i tried on , bind
[20:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you used .on() incorrectly i'm guessing.
[20:14:40] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried with .on()
[20:16:26] <Northwoods> http://prntscr.com/u3s9kx
[20:16:54] <robertmaxrees> so go check the link i dropped to the docs.
[20:17:10] <robertmaxrees> what does that tell you?
[20:17:10] <Northwoods> yes i saw it at very first instance
[20:17:18] <Northwoods> it looks like my solution
[20:17:20] <robertmaxrees> how is that different from what you tried?
[20:17:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:17:25] <Northwoods> buy i never went in there
[20:17:44] <Northwoods> never thought they would give javascript event trigger
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:18:44] <Northwoods> You should listen to events from the <input type="checkbox"> directly rather than look for custom events.
[20:18:52] <Northwoods> what does this line from doc mean
[20:22:00] <robertmaxrees> look at the JS example.
[20:22:08] <robertmaxrees> how is that different from what you have
[20:22:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:22:24] <Northwoods> change ?
[20:22:31] <Northwoods> just change event
[20:22:41] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  have you tried binding to that instead of click?
[20:23:04] <Northwoods> i did , it works in fiddle but not at local host
[20:23:27] <Northwoods> let me remove all other js files
[20:23:33] <robertmaxrees> slow down yo.
[20:23:40] <robertmaxrees> so change the minimal test case to use change
[20:23:47] <robertmaxrees> let's get the minimal version working first.
[20:23:59] <Northwoods> it works in js fiddle
[20:24:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:24:09] <robertmaxrees> so like i said earlier.
[20:24:13] <Northwoods> https://jsfiddle.net/a94ukcpe/1/
[20:24:20] <robertmaxrees> now start adding back the different other scripts one by one.
[20:24:26] <robertmaxrees> to the fiddle.
[20:24:28] <Northwoods> ok
[20:24:33] <robertmaxrees> and see when it breaks.
[20:25:07] <Northwoods> ok let me see
[20:28:18] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, nice moves , found the evil
[20:28:23] <robertmaxrees> What was it?
[20:28:24] <Northwoods> :) Thanks
[20:28:32] <Northwoods> Another js script
[20:28:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, which one? :)
[20:29:13] <Northwoods> assest/h2c/html2canvas.js
[20:29:39] <Northwoods> it is meant to take screenshot of whole page
[20:29:51] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[20:29:58] <Northwoods> html2canvas(document.body,{background: '#fff'}).then(function(canvas) {
[20:29:58] <Northwoods> 	
[20:29:58] <Northwoods> 	 document.body.appendChild(canvas);
[20:29:58] <Northwoods> 	
[20:29:58] <Northwoods> 	 // Get base64URL
[20:29:59] <Northwoods> 	 var base64URL = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg').replace('image/jpeg', 'image/octet-stream');
[20:30:04] <robertmaxrees> wiag,
[20:30:07] <robertmaxrees> *woah
[20:30:15] <robertmaxrees> please don't do multi-lin pastes :)
[20:30:20] <Northwoods> ok :)
[20:31:00] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, thanks for help mate
[20:31:06] <robertmaxrees> sure.
