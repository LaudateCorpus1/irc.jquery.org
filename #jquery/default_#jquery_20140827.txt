[00:52:12] <t4nk925> Hello everyone
[00:52:48] <t4nk925> Anyone seen Brice Darnon's website? http://bricedarmon.com/ How do you think that image slider is working? Not the 3d one at the home page, but after clicking on "Orange Tropical" for example.
[00:54:04] <t4nk925> It looks like he's using a combination of both css3 and javascript for the animations, but I'm not entirely sure.

[01:10:22] <faraway> i want to listen to the transitionend event in jquery. As there are still brwosers around that require a vendor prvix for that i wonder if there is a plugin for jquery that will automaticially do the prefixing for me, and filtering out double emitting of events.
[01:23:56] <elmcrest> Hi again. I am wondering why this https://dpaste.de/77gU isn't working. I change the ID of the button and want to use it again with a different function. so actually something like toggle
[01:24:06] <jop008> I have list items with class ui-li-static ui-body-inherit ui-first-child ui-last-child I want to catch the click event I now have $(".ui-li-static").click(function() { with an alert but no alert fired
[01:24:39] <Cork> elmcrest: the selectors is to find the element to add the event handler to
[01:24:45] <Cork> it isn't a dynamic thing
[01:24:58] <elmcrest> ah ok
[01:25:13] <Cork> elmcrest: best option is to set .data('state', 'save'/'edit')
[01:25:16] <Cork> and check that
[01:25:25] <Cork> (with an if case)
[01:25:59] <Cork> jop008: and the element exist when you run the selector?
[01:26:13] <elmcrest> Cork thx
[01:26:35] <jop008> The li items are injected later on
[01:26:46] <hendry> hi, i have a simple table where i need a button on each row, bound to send a textarea via json... are there good examples to get me started? http://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/m2nypxyz/
[01:26:48] <jop008> is the selector time dependent?
[01:27:06] <Cork> jop008: $() is a function
[01:27:14] <jop008> I tought it always holds
[01:27:15] <Cork> when you run it it runs document.querySelectorAll
[01:27:39] <Cork> and then .click loops that list and binds an addEventListener('click'... on each of the elements found
[01:27:51] <jop008> So in the autocomplete function define this class selector
[01:27:53] <Cork> that is all $(".ui-li-static").click does
[01:28:09] <Cork> you most likely need to use delegated event listener
[01:28:29] <Cork> that is all $(document).on('click', '.ui-li-static'
[01:28:32] <Cork> opps
[01:28:38] <Cork> -"that is all"
[01:28:53] <jop008> Give it a try
[01:32:12] <Cork> jop008: also jquery ui autocomplete has rendering hooks you can use to do this more cleanly
[01:33:06] <jop008> works fine! thx
[01:33:29] <jop008> I searched on hooks documentation but couldn't found a list
[01:33:43] <jop008> Most examples on the web are the old version
[01:33:51] <jop008> 1.4 completely changed
[01:34:06] <Cork> ya
[01:34:22] <Cork> but .data('autocomplete') should still have a _render or _render* function
[01:34:25] <Cork> (s)
[01:38:47] <huand> hi, i have a newbie question:how to execute functions defined in a seperated js file in jq $(document).ready(function{});
[01:38:48] <huand> Failed as below:
[01:38:48] <huand> in a.js
[01:38:48] <huand> =========================
[01:38:48] <huand> dummy = function(){
[01:38:48] <huand>   console.log("ah");
[01:38:49] <huand> };
[01:38:49] <huand> =========================
[01:38:50] <huand> in html page
[01:38:50] <huand> =========================
[01:46:21] <jop008> and is there a select: function(){     $('.college').trigger('click'); } select function?
[01:46:30] <jop008> in 1.4 autocomplete?
[01:57:11] <hendry> hi, i'm wondering what's the right way of grabbing textarea here so i can post it to a JSON API? http://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/m2nypxyz/5/
[02:02:31] <supreme__> why is it that jquery offset only has left and top? not bottom?
[02:08:54] <jop008> Is there a good way to handle keypress on the liitems of an autocomplete I know use   $("li").delegate(".ui-li-static", "keydown", function(e) {
[02:09:05] <jop008> but no action on that
[02:21:07] <BinaryKitten> jop008 1) delegate is deprecated - use on in delegation mode $('selector').on('keydown', 'childselector', fn(e) {     2) you want to target the parent item to use instead of li .. try an id if possible for better results   eg $('#mylist').on('keydown', '.ul-li-static'.......
[02:25:04] <Cork> BinaryKitten: no it isn't
[02:25:17] <Cork> BinaryKitten: superseded yes, deprecated; no
[02:25:32] <Cork> it is perfectly valid to use .delegate if you find it more readable
[02:26:43] <Cork> jop008: the key event happens on the input element
[02:26:49] <Cork> not the li
[02:27:30] <jop008> makes sense
[02:29:20] <Cork> BinaryKitten: to be clear delegate is a tiny function that just calls back into on, so there is no need to depricate it
[02:29:30] <Cork> as the cost of having it is none existent
[02:30:14] <mukesh_> is cork is there??
[02:30:28] <Cork> mukesh_: is what?
[02:30:39] <AdamPDotty> is cork is there is
[02:31:02] <mukesh_> sorry
[02:31:08] <mukesh_> need some favour
[02:31:30] <Cork> BinaryKitten: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.delegate
[02:33:02] <mukesh_> can we show list of all books which are added in google using api
[02:33:33] <Cork> mukesh_: i have no clue
[02:33:43] <mukesh_> ??
[02:34:00] <Cork> i'm not an expert in googles apis
[02:34:11] <mukesh_> ok
[02:34:40] <Cork> you should prob ask that in googles support channels instead of here
[02:38:46] <FilipNortic> can I set a metatag on an iframe with jquery (or js)?
[02:41:02] <null--> no
[02:46:02] <FilipNortic> was that last no an answer to my question?
[02:46:41] <Koopz> i'd say yes
[02:49:12] <jop008> Can you mkae a delegat function with this data-type="search I want to capture the keypresses on htat item
[02:51:38] <jop008> found like this $('[data-type="input"]').each(function() {
[02:56:06] <Cork> jop008: if the data-type is an attribute (meaning it is actually on the element
[02:56:08] <Cork> yes you can
[02:56:42] <Cork> FilipNortic: you can create a metatag element in the page if the iframes content is from your domain
[02:56:55] <Cork> but this will happen after the parser has gone through the page, so won't matter
[02:57:38] <jop008> I tried this   $(document).on('keyPress', "data-type='search'", function() { but not succesfull
[02:58:41] <Cork> you forgot the []
[02:58:53] <Cork> else you won't be looking for the attribute
[03:07:44] <jop008> So what is a better solution?
[03:10:09] <Cork> jop008: firstly keypress is not reacommended it is a none standard key event
[03:10:29] <Cork> use keydown instead (yes it is silly but on the web it does press not down)
[03:11:05] <Cork> for the selector '[data-type="input"]' should work just fine
[03:11:23] <jop008> okay
[03:11:41] <jop008> but then the trigger is on  all input elements
[03:11:50] <jop008> not only the search type
[03:11:59] <Cork> well no the trigger is on document
[03:12:14] <Cork> for all elements that has an attribute data-type="search"
[03:12:36] <jop008> you typed data-type=input
[03:13:13] <Cork> ah, right
[03:13:21] <Cork> the point is [key="value"]
[03:15:25] <jop008> so what do I need data-type=input or search?
[03:15:34] <jop008> I will try both
[03:19:10] <jop008> unrecognized expression   $(document).on('keydown', "data-type='search'", function() {
[03:21:46] <Cork> jop008: again you are skipping the attribute selector
[03:22:08] <jop008> Sorry
[03:23:23] <jop008> I follow the same pattern like   $(document).on('click', '.ui-li-static', function() {
[03:23:29] <jop008> which worked okay
[03:23:44] <Cork> except you don't have an element <data-type='search'>
[03:23:55] <Cork> its an attribute so you need an attribute selector
[03:24:11] <jop008> Yes I see question how
[03:24:17] <Cork> ...
[03:24:26] <Cork> i've given you the exact format
[03:24:40] <Cork> but you keep removing the markers
[03:26:03] <jop008> Scrolled back can find
[03:26:40] <jop008> can't find
[03:30:16] <vishaldeep> jop008: $(document).on('click', "[data-type='search'", function()
[03:30:33] <jop008> Thanks
[03:30:35] <vishaldeep> jop008: $(document).on('click', "[data-type='search']", function()
[03:32:34] <jop008> yes works fine
[03:34:20] <elmcrest> Cork could you have another look if you don't mind? https://dpaste.de/wp7e
[03:34:46] <elmcrest> as you see I struggle with the basics in javascript :/
[03:35:03] <elmcrest> maybe I should get me a book or video tutorial
[03:35:20] <Cork> elmcrest: you really shouldn't do style:'background-color:#FFFFFF;'
[03:35:21] <Cork> ever
[03:35:40] <Cork> either use .css('background-color', '')
[03:35:48] <Cork> or better use a class and have the style in css
[03:36:48] <Cork> elmcrest: i don't see anything strange except for that
[03:37:58] <elmcrest> Cork I get an Uncaught TypeError undefined is not a function ... and my console.log() doesn't work
[03:45:02] <palzie> hey, what is the correct syntax to include a variable used in a for in an element selection ? $('#myid .myclass-" + i + " .mysubclass') ?
[03:47:15] <elmcrest> Cork this works now ... I needed to dict.push with {key: mykey, value:txt} ... though thx for looking
[03:53:22] <Snoopal> jQuery(document).on('event') triggers when the event starts. but how can I trigger after the event is done?
[04:05:30] <Cork> elmcrest: just set both keys in the {}
[04:06:12] <Cork> Snoopal: what event are you aiming for?
[04:06:16] <elmcrest> Cork how do you mean that?
[04:06:40] <Cork> palzie: there isn't one
[04:07:06] <Cork> elmcrest: dict.push({ key: key, value:txt })
[04:07:50] <elmcrest> Cork hmm thats what I do :)
[04:08:06] <Cork> elmcrest: then you should have what your looking for
[04:08:16] <elmcrest> Cork jep, thx
[04:08:37] <Snoopal> Cork: forget it got it already :) but thx anyway
[04:25:51] <Snoopal> i appended html to a div. now i try to trigger a click on it but it doesnt fire. any ideas? i used jQuery('#eo-next-button').on('click',function(e){ console.log(123); }); no reaction
[04:26:22] <Cork> did the button exist when you ran that line?
[04:31:14] <Snoopal> no
[04:31:21] <Snoopal> its loaded afterwards
[04:33:28] <Cork> Snoopal: then you have the answer
[04:33:40] <Cork> $() searches for dom for elements matching the selector
[04:33:53] <Cork> .on then loops the list of elements and adds event listeners to them
[04:34:11] <Snoopal> hmm
[04:34:19] <Cork> Snoopal: the solution is to bind the event to an element that always exist
[04:34:31] <Cork> and instead delegate the event handler from it
[04:34:42] <Snoopal> like body?
[04:34:52] <Cork> (on takes a selector as the second argument for this)
[04:35:10] <Cork> Snoopal: well document if you need to go that far up
[04:35:26] <Cork> but if possible it is normally better to grab a closer parent if possible
[04:35:44] <Snoopal> hmmm ok
[04:35:45] <Snoopal> i see
[04:35:58] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com delegate
[04:35:59] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:36:36] <Snoopal> thx!! :)
[04:58:22] <DarsVaeda> is there a pattern or something for this kind of thing: http://pastebin.com/8eTfJtpu
[04:58:25] <DarsVaeda> pseudocode
[04:58:52] <DarsVaeda> doing it like line 6 helps a bit but still feels horrible to read
[05:03:27] <Cork> DarsVaeda: remove the number from the class
[05:03:35] <Cork> and store it as data-type="2"
[05:03:56] <DarsVaeda> no I meant doing all that .on()
[05:04:03] <Cork> then in the function do switch($(this).data('type')) { case 2: break; }
[05:04:36] <Cork> "all that"?
[05:04:37] <DarsVaeda> ah yeah well okay...but that is the same in another jacket :P
[05:04:51] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not really
[05:05:02] <Cork> you would only need one event handler
[05:05:37] <Cork> $('.container').on('action', '.trigger', function() {});
[05:05:40] <DarsVaeda> okay true but I lose the ability to deactivate one if I need to
[05:05:54] <DarsVaeda> , not?
[05:05:54] <Cork> you could have data-disabled
[05:06:08] <Cork> or add a disabled class
[05:06:19] <Cork> $('.container').on('action', '.trigger:not(.disabled)', function() {});
[05:06:38] <Cork> then you would have a class to handle styling of the disabled option
[05:06:56] <DarsVaeda> okay true for the same action
[05:07:04] <DarsVaeda> what do you do for different actions?
[05:07:18] <Cork> if you need per type
[05:07:25] <Cork> it would still work
[05:07:33] <Cork> as the event is per click event
[05:07:57] <Cork> sorry not click
[05:07:58] <Cork> action
[05:08:53] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay, thanks for your input :)
[05:21:12] <workerbe1two> Hi. How do I pass a json-like object via ajax?  Can I do something like this ?:  $.ajax(  ...  data : {  MyObject1 : field11 = 'val11', field12 = 'val12' , MyObject2 : field21 = 'val21', field22 = 'val22' ... }  );
[05:22:39] <rgman> workerbe1two: data: { obj1 : {prop1: {}, ...}, obj2: {}, ..}
[05:22:39] <Cork> workerbe1two: so basically you want { MyObject1 : { field11: 'val11', field12: 'val12' }, MyObject2 : { field21: 'val21', field22: 'val22' } } ?
[05:23:36] <workerbe1two> Cork: yes . I can live with that too.
[05:23:46] <Cork> workerbe1two: live with?
[05:24:02] <Cork> just from parsing your syntax to something valid gave me that
[05:24:21] <Cork> if you want something else you need to explain what the difference would be
[05:24:41] <rgman> workerbe1two: Every property in the object (data) will be a POST/GET field in the server,
[05:25:04] <workerbe1two> Cork: I meant that I am not bound to that key = val notation. I can use the real json syntax that made of it.
[05:25:12] <vishaldeep> or maybe stringify json
[05:25:24] <vishaldeep> if only one param is required on server side
[05:25:27] <Cork> workerbe1two: it isn't json syntax
[05:25:33] <Cork> it is object syntax
[05:25:35] <workerbe1two> oh its not.
[05:25:42] <Cork> json syntax is { "key": "value" }
[05:26:45] <workerbe1two> where is the diffefrence if you nest such a json then its the same as
[05:26:49] <workerbe1two>  { MyObject1 : { field11: 'val11', field12: 'val12' }, MyObject2 : { field21: 'val21', field22: 'val22' } }
[05:27:19] <Cork> workerbe1two: that is a valid javascript object, but not a valid json object
[05:27:27] <Cork> json only allows "key" keys
[05:27:32] <Cork> and '' for strings isn't allowed
[05:27:58] <Cork> workerbe1two: also by definition json is a string, not javascript
[05:28:06] <workerbe1two> ah sure.
[05:28:20] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify({key:'hello'}));
[05:28:25] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:28:28] <Cork> ...
[05:28:47] <Cork> stupid bot...
[05:28:57] <Cork> {"key":"hello"}
[05:29:43] <workerbe1two> but one could stringify my lsit of MyObject's yes?
[05:29:50] <elmcrest> I have something like this now where I am again stuck ... [{"key":"name","value":"Neues Projekt"},{"key":"description","value":"Nochasnd ajsndaskjnd as"},{"key":"city","value":"None"},{"key":"id","value":"1"}] ... that's the result from JSON.stringify() - I expect something like {{"name":"Neues projekt"},...} instead
[05:30:14] <Cork> workerbe1two: to roll this up a bit, json is a subset of the javascript object syntax rule
[05:30:36] <Cork> workerbe1two: meaning json can be a javascript object, but not necessary the other way around
[05:31:25] <Cork> elmcrest: {{}} would be invalid
[05:31:26] <tushigushi> Hi everyone, I'm a newbie developer and I need your help. I'm making a website, and I have a dropdown menu on it. However on certain pages navigation is done using jquery (I have side menu and I hide and show <divs>), is there a way that I click on dropdown menu inner item and first goes, to the page via  <a></a> but then automatically executes jquery navigation function?
[05:31:38] <Cork> elmcrest: as objects has to have key:value combinations
[05:32:07] <Cork> elmcrest: so if you use a list of elements, without a key (array) you get [{}, {}]
[05:32:58] <Cork> tushigushi: separate out your question from the rest so ppl easily can see your question
[05:33:06] <Cork> that makes it much more likely to get an answer
[05:33:07] <elmcrest> Cork yes ok - that's actually what I get so far. the problem is the key: and value: within the array
[05:33:28] <workerbe1two> ok. the server(perl) receives "key" : "value" .  But I want to send such an "object" list and access its values object by object.
[05:33:31] <Cork> elmcrest: not sure what you mean
[05:33:54] <Cork> workerbe1two: so you want to send a param key with json in it?
[05:34:11] <elmcrest> Cork instead of  [{"key":"name","value":"Neues Projekt"}, I'd like to have [{"name":"Neues Projekt"},
[05:34:32] <Cork> workerbe1two: data: { json: JSON.stringify({ MyObject1 : { field11: 'val11', field12: 'val12' }, MyObject2 : { field21: 'val21', field22: 'val22' } }) },
[05:34:43] <Cork> elmcrest: ah
[05:34:51] <Cork> elmcrest: so you want dynamic keys
[05:34:53] <tushigushi> Cork: how do I separate it?
[05:35:14] <Cork> tushigushi: just ask the question on its own line instead of embedding it in a long story
[05:35:34] <Cork> elmcrest: ecmascript pre 6 can't do that
[05:35:59] <Cork> elmcrest: so you need to do var obj = {}; obj[key] = txt; dics.push(obj);
[05:36:38] <tushigushi> Is there a way that I click on dropdown menu inner item and first goes, to the page via  <a></a> but then automatically executes jquery navigation function?
[05:36:51] <tushigushi> Cork: thanks
[05:37:02] <Cork> tushigushi: you can't execute javascript after a normal page load
[05:37:09] <Cork> js is unloaded when the page is unloaded
[05:37:19] <elmcrest> Cork works perfectly, thx
[05:37:42] <Cork> tushigushi: correction you can't execute javascript cross a normal page load
[05:38:06] <Cork> tushigushi: javascript on the loading page can get info on things and run it there
[05:38:07] <workerbe1two> Cork: then I would get key 'json' and value a "json_string", then I would need to parse the json_string in the perl server, right?
[05:38:18] <Cork> workerbe1two: correct
[05:40:47] <tushigushi> Cork: so as page has been loaded it can check what made it load?
[05:41:32] <Cork> tushigushi: possibly
[05:41:44] <Cork> the browser sends a referrer
[05:41:55] <Cork> and you could base it on that
[05:42:06] <Cork> or the server could grab the same data and forward it
[05:42:16] <Cork> ?g mdn document.referrer
[05:42:18] <b-ot> Cork: Document.referrer - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.referrer
[05:42:49] <tushigushi> Cork: thanks, I'll study it.
[05:47:15] <elmcrest> Cork since you helped me so often - I have another question :) though I don't want to annoy you ... anyway, I'd like to get the response object which is JSON logged to the console, but so far no luck with that
[05:48:07] <Cork> elmcrest: logged to the console?
[05:48:17] <Cork> you mean console.log(obj) ?
[05:48:20] <elmcrest> Cork written to the console ... yes
[05:48:42] <Cork> all modern browsers should give you a usable object output from that
[05:48:55] <Cork> only ie still give the old silly [object object]
[05:49:06] <elmcrest> It's from a $.ajax()
[05:49:17] <Cork> doesn't really change anything
[05:49:36] <elmcrest> ah ok
[05:49:38] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function(data) { console.log(data); });
[05:50:02] <elmcrest> here's what I have so far https://dpaste.de/KRuA
[05:50:06] <workerbe1two> Cork: ok thanks.
[05:50:29] <Cork> elmcrest: you mean in the error handler?
[05:50:35] <elmcrest> Cork yes
[05:52:01] <Cork> elmcrest: error: function(xhr) { console.log(xhr.responseText); })
[05:52:21] <Cork> the argument to error isn't the response
[05:55:38] <elmcrest> Cork hold on ... tele^^
[05:57:30] <elmcrest> Cork nice work again :) thx again! :)
[05:57:43] <elmcrest> btw how does javascript know from xhr f.e.?
[05:58:06] <elmcrest> I'm a bit confused from where the names of such variables are coming from...
[05:58:42] <Cork> elmcrest: tried reading the api docs? :D
[05:59:02] <elmcrest> Cork tried, yes ;)
[05:59:28] <Cork> elmcrest: but to be clear error: function(response) { console.log(response.responseText); } would work just as well
[05:59:37] <Cork> it would just be confusing as it isn't response data
[05:59:54] <elmcrest> Cork I see
[06:00:37] <Cork> elmcrest: if you check the docs it defines: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[06:00:44] <Cork> under the error option
[06:01:11] <Cork> and to further explain xhr stands for XmlHttpResponse
[06:01:14] <Cork> and is a dom function
[06:01:18] <elmcrest> Cork hmm I have problems understanding that ...
[06:01:26] <Cork> ?g mdn XMLHTTPResponse
[06:01:28] <b-ot> Cork: XMLHttpRequest - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[06:01:41] <Cork> elmcrest: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown ) means
[06:01:43] <elmcrest> no not that ... the syntax you wrote from the api docs
[06:01:50] <elmcrest> yes, that ^^
[06:02:07] <Cork> that error: takes a function like error: function(jqXHR, textStatus,  errorThrown) {},
[06:02:40] <Cork> and it explains what the different arguments contain
[06:03:11] <Cork> ex. Possible values for the second argument [textStatus] (besides null) are "timeout", "error", "abort", and "parsererror".
[06:04:16] <elmcrest> Cork ok I think I got that
[06:05:03] <Cork> elmcrest: the definitions i've quoted is taken from here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:05:18] <elmcrest> Cork yes I'm there ^^
[06:08:09] <daum> hey guys - any idea on how to do the following:  I have a table which when a user clicks a row i clone it to a table above.  the problem is this causes the screen to jump as the new row above is added.

[07:56:13] <fission6> how do i make jquery nto escape my data values for ajax GET
[07:56:27] <m4strmind^> Hey guys i just authored a new plugin for jquery ui-widgets that will dynamically inject them into your page if they do not exist when you want to use them.  Check it out and let me know.  http://plugins.jquery.com/dynamicWidget/
[07:57:31] <m4strmind^> they work just like jquery ui widgets except you dont have to worry about your includes before you go to use it :)
[08:12:12] <jop008> when I insert <div class='new_value'>" + ctext + "<div>"; in an html field the content start wrapping
[08:12:24] <jop008> I want all the html on one row
[08:13:50] <xxx1337> what's a good jquery or js library to be able to get placeholder on inputs for internet explorer?
[08:14:18] <xxx1337> I'm using one that is pretty much okay but removes the placeholder text when I have that input field focused
[08:14:31] <xxx1337> is focused*
[08:16:01] <xxx1337> I think the only I'm using isn't actually placeholder text, rather it's real text that goes away when the input field is highlighted or focused
[08:16:19] <xxx1337> do all librarys that try to deal with placaeholder text on ie do the same?
[08:16:31] <xxx1337> one not only*
[08:16:40] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[08:16:45] <drej> xxx1337 look at polyfills
[08:16:59] <drej> xxx1337 https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
[08:17:11] <drej> specifically: placeholder is here https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills#web-forms--input-placeholder
[08:17:25] <drej> but bookmark that list and use those polyfills to offer backwards compatibility to older browsers
[08:17:39] <drej> because they're made specifically for that, and are conditional to whether or not a browser supports that function natively
[08:17:39] <robertmaxrees> drej++
[08:17:52] <drej> instead of some arbitrary plugin thing
[08:17:58] <drej> robertmaxrees <3
[08:19:43] <xxx1337> thanks drej
[08:19:47] <drej> np
[08:25:53] <jop008> how to avoid wrapping in a div? I add <div calss='newitem>new</div>
[08:27:53] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[08:41:50] <faraway> is the a plugin that allows to call ‚.animate({'transform': {rotateZ:'10deg', translateZ:'0px’}},100)’  i found some that have their own function but none that hooks into animate.
[08:45:23] <decx> the plugin is called addClass()
[08:45:55] <faraway> decx: Well the problem is that the anymations depend on the window size, so they are not hard coded. I for sure know that i can create cssRules on the fly. But for some reason this some 3d transormations fail to work while transition is active.
[08:45:56] <faraway> decx: because of that i want to use animate until I am able to trac down tha actual problem.
[08:45:56] <decx> media queries
[08:50:50] <axilla> does anyone know how in jqmodal to prevent it from destroying the modal on close?
[08:50:50] <axilla> when I call .jqmHide() it pretty much deletes everything from the DOM
[08:51:15] <axilla> so trying to call it again just causes huge issues.
[08:54:55] <decx> i dont believe it
[08:57:21] <faraway> decx: media queries won’t help in that particular case. anyway, i found a plugin right now.
[08:57:33] <decx> i dont believe it
[09:04:28] <Cydrobolt> hello
[09:04:32] <Cydrobolt> I have this code https://gist.github.com/Cydrobolt/28cbbc76029ba666ca35
[09:04:45] <Cydrobolt> and I'm trying to call a function when any form is submitted
[09:04:49] <Cydrobolt> but the callback isn't working
[09:07:12] <NinjaBanjo> Cydrobolt, is the form loaded ont he page when the .on fires?
[09:07:25] <Cydrobolt> yes
[09:07:36] <NinjaBanjo> what errors are you getting?
[09:07:39] <Cydrobolt> none at all
[09:08:03] <Cydrobolt> also, none of the console.log()s get fired
[09:08:09] <NinjaBanjo> can you try this in the console: $('form').trigger('submit')
[09:08:49] <Cydrobolt> ok
[09:08:54] <NinjaBanjo> does it do anything?
[09:09:39] <Cydrobolt> no
[09:09:44] <Cydrobolt> it just spits out the HTML of the form
[09:10:06] <Cydrobolt> I am getting some unrelated errorsin console, though,
[09:10:09] <Cydrobolt> let me check on them
[09:10:31] <NinjaBanjo> Cydrobolt, errors on page load? or when you tried stuff I mentioned?
[09:10:46] <Cydrobolt> no, nevermind
[09:10:54] <Cydrobolt> it wasn't related to the onsubmit
[09:11:12] <Cydrobolt> no errors, and the trigger statement makes it spit out the HTML of the form
[09:11:17] <NinjaBanjo> no but if js fails on something before reaching the onsubmit, it won't fire the .on
[09:11:31] <NinjaBanjo> if in the same scope
[09:11:39] <Cydrobolt> oh
[09:11:48] <Cydrobolt> maybe that's it
[09:11:49] <Cydrobolt> let me check
[09:11:56] <NinjaBanjo> run your $('form').on() in the console once
[09:12:14] <Cydrobolt> is there a way to check whether a variable is set without causing a ReferenceError?
[09:12:42] <jonez> greetings. I'm having trouble with serialize() not picking up current form values after I re-display my form using .post
[09:13:12] <NinjaBanjo> you can type it into the console and it will say undefined? or are you meaning at runtime Cydrobolt ?
[09:13:12] <jonez> I've googled a bit, and even tried changing my event delegation, all to no avail. I need some help working this one out :)
[09:13:36] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, can you provide a code example?
[09:14:27] <Cydrobolt> NinjaBanjo, at runtime, I have an if statement checking whether a var is set
[09:14:32] <Cydrobolt> which gives an error since the var isn't set
[09:14:45] <Cydrobolt> running the .on() in the console gives me the HTML to the form
[09:15:21] <jonez> NinjaBanjo, yes. http://jqueryfreenode.privatepaste.com/d28b45e9c6
[09:15:36] <NinjaBanjo> Cydrobolt, after running the .on in console try this again: $('form').trigger('submit')
[09:15:41] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, lemme take a look
[09:15:44] <m4strmind^> there is no such thing as unrelated errors in javascript :)
[09:15:47] <jonez> ty :)
[09:15:56] <Cydrobolt> referenceerror, socket is not defined
[09:16:09] <Cydrobolt> because it's out of the scope where socket is defined
[09:17:11] <NinjaBanjo> Cydrobolt, but it was bound this time so something fails in the js blocking it from firing.
[09:17:24] <m4strmind^> Cydrobolt, here is a very basic example of how to get a submit button fireing through a javascript event.  I hope this puts you on the right track http://jsfiddle.net/vajs6hhe/
[09:17:28] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, can you serialize the form outside of your function? if you just do a $('form'
[09:17:38] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, can you serialize the form outside of your function? if you just do a $('form').serialize()
[09:17:43] <Cydrobolt> yeah
[09:17:51] <Cydrobolt> I think I know why it might not be firing
[09:18:07] <jonez> NinjaBanjo, I tried that. I had a 'form' var I made, and wrote 'dat = form.serialize()'
[09:18:08] <NinjaBanjo> m4strmind^, he has it right, there is just an error in his code before the .on fires, causing it not to fire
[09:18:20] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, try it in the console, outside of the script
[09:18:24] <jonez> the form seems to keep whatever values it had before I changed anything
[09:18:32] <jonez> ok
[09:18:36] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, how are you updating the values?
[09:18:49] <jonez> it's a normal form save for the 'pageprotocol' field
[09:19:02] <Cydrobolt> still no luck :(
[09:19:13] <Cydrobolt> got rid of all errors in the console
[09:19:16] <Cydrobolt> but it still doesn't fire
[09:19:28] <Cydrobolt> is it because the form is generated by jQuery?
[09:19:28] <robertmaxrees> binding woes?
[09:19:35] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the form after pageload?
[09:19:39] <Cydrobolt> yeah
[09:19:44] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[09:19:45] <jonez> NinjaBanjo, works fine from console
[09:19:47] <NinjaBanjo> then yes, you will need to use a delegate
[09:19:57] <Cydrobolt> Oh, how?
[09:20:00] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, you might have some firing order issues
[09:20:01] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:20:11] <NinjaBanjo> robertmaxrees++
[09:20:16] <jonez> the .post always gets triggered when it should.
[09:20:28] <robertmaxrees> where "child" is the original target and parent is something that exists on pageload.
[09:20:39] <Cydrobolt> so any element on pageload?
[09:20:47] <Cydrobolt> or an outer div
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> Cydrobolt any ancestor element on pageload.
[09:21:01] <Cydrobolt> e.g body?
[09:21:01] <robertmaxrees> it must be a parent of the element you're trying to trigger off of.
[09:21:05] <Cydrobolt> ok
[09:21:11] <NinjaBanjo> Cydrobolt, it could look like this: $('body').on('submit', 'form', function(){})
[09:21:12] <robertmaxrees> if you can bind further down, that would be smarter, but body will work.
[09:21:33] <NinjaBanjo> robertmaxrees, the submit will actually bubble up all the way, so it can be wherever
[09:21:35] <Cydrobolt> ahhhh
[09:21:37] <Cydrobolt> let me try it now
[09:21:40] <robertmaxrees> NinjaBanjo i'm aware.
[09:22:04] <robertmaxrees> but there's no reason to unnecessarily filter all events of a given type if you don't need to :)
[09:22:24] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer binding as close as I can.
[09:22:27] <Cydrobolt> okay, everything works now
[09:22:36] <Cydrobolt> thanks a lot, robertmaxrees and NinjaBanjo !
[09:22:40] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[09:30:37] <jonez> NinjaBanjo, I fixed it :)  I changed the first line of the event handler to "form = $("#form")" and everything started working
[09:31:10] <jonez> I think it was a scoping issue
[09:31:20] <robertmaxrees> what was the code?
[09:32:20] <jonez> robertmaxrees, http://jqueryfreenode.privatepaste.com/d28b45e9c6# is what I started with.
[09:32:46] <jonez> I added a line between 14 and 15 to 'reassign' the form var
[09:33:42] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to.
[09:33:47] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, ahh can't believe I didn't catch that
[09:34:15] <jonez> robertmaxrees, why?
[09:34:31] <robertmaxrees> the form var on line 4 should exist in all child scopes, as well.
[09:34:40] <NinjaBanjo> robertmaxrees, he's binding an on function,
[09:34:50] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: except its lost when called via function/listener
[09:34:53] <NinjaBanjo> scope changes because it fires in the global scope
[09:35:02] <robertmaxrees> ooooh i see it now.
[09:35:02] <robertmaxrees> derp
[09:35:12] <robertmaxrees> good catch.
[09:35:17] <jonez> 2 days of struggle for one or two lines :)
[09:35:25] <NinjaBanjo> jonez, welcome to web dev
[09:35:30] <jonez> ;)
[09:35:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why I avoid setting up listeners in functions like that hahaha
[09:36:35] <NinjaBanjo> if you want some real fun, go play with angularjs
[09:36:40] <robertmaxrees> :(
[09:36:44] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[09:36:52] <NinjaBanjo> I build most of my projects on it
[09:37:12] <NinjaBanjo> but jQuery is still a staple in my libs
[09:37:29] <jonez> what does angularjs get me?
[09:37:48] <robertmaxrees> structure
[09:38:12] <robertmaxrees> templating with data-binding
[09:38:54] <gnarf> data binding is the real win
[09:39:12] <gnarf> of course, encapsulation / components is also very useful
[09:39:29] <gnarf> angular/ember are both good tools for apps more than sites though
[09:39:32] <nicetry> hey there, I know its posible to do $('foo, bar') and get all foos and bars. Is it possilbe to select a specific dom node and this at the same time. eg. $(this+',foo,bar')
[09:39:44] <NinjaBanjo> gnarf, i build mostly apps
[09:39:47] <robertmaxrees> "a specific dom", nicetry?
[09:39:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean to want to add foo and bar to a particular collection?
[09:40:02] <gnarf> nicetry $('foo,bar').add(element)
[09:40:08] <gnarf> `api add
[09:40:08] <b-ot> gnarf: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[09:40:25] <nicetry> so $(this).add('foo, bar') would also work?
[09:40:32] <gnarf> nicetry yes
[09:40:39] <nicetry> thanks guys!
[09:40:42] <robertmaxrees> var $newStuff = $('foo, bar').add(element); if you want to be able to use it like a var later.
[09:40:51] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't modify the original stuff in place IIRC>
[09:41:00] <gnarf> nope, its a new chain
[09:41:23] <krambiorix> i have a table with in all table cells numbers... Is there any plugin to show, per row, a chart in background of the evolution of the numbers in that row?
[09:41:24] <gnarf> there is also .not()
[09:41:34] <gnarf> to remove particular elements
[09:41:35] <gnarf> i.e.
[09:41:43] <gnarf> buttons.not(this).removeClass('active')
[09:43:36] <m4strmind^> you guys should check out my new plugin and let me know what you think.  http://plugins.jquery.com/dynamicWidget/  its basically a very easy way to load up custom jquery ui widgets without having to worry about if the widget been included on your individual page.  I thought it would be useful :)
[09:45:11] * NinjaBanjo is off for lunch
[09:48:01] <clarkk> a jquery plugin that I use inserts an element in the page with a defined height that is shown in the html as style="height: 46px;". I've tried to change this using $('.element').height('66px') and $('.element').attr('height', '66px'), but neither have any effect. Can anyone hazard a
[09:48:02] <clarkk> guess why this may be?
[09:49:30] <m4strmind^> clarkk, your css selector is probably wrong.  you likely dont have class="element" on your element
[09:50:22] <m4strmind^> or if you just want the one element you can do $("#elementid")....
[09:50:37] <clarkk> m4strmind^: haha, now I feel stupid! ;)
[09:50:54] <clarkk> m4strmind^: you were right, I missed the dot of the class selector
[09:51:04] <m4strmind^> dont worry about it :) we all make mistakes
[09:51:07] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple.
[09:51:20] <clarkk> thank you m4strmind^ :)
[09:53:47] <m4strmind^> anytime
[09:57:07] <dmsuperman> clarkk: I would use .css('height', '66px') if the original height is coming from CSS anyway. Just for consistency sake
[09:58:06] <adamellsworth> How can you take a string of HTML and replace one of the child element's innerHTML with a value then return the entire string?
[09:58:44] <dmsuperman> adamellsworth: put the string into a document fragment and then do normal DOM manipulations
[09:58:49] <dmsuperman> don't try to parse it as a string
[09:59:30] <dmsuperman> then use .html() to return the string
[09:59:52] <m4strmind^> you dont have to actually append it to the dom :)
[09:59:52] <adamellsworth> document fragment?
[10:00:11] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth pass the string to $()
[10:00:12] <m4strmind^> $("<div></div>")
[10:00:53] <dmsuperman> a document fragment is part of the DOM, it's just a detached part. you can still do DOM manipulations on it
[10:01:32] <m4strmind^> sort of, things like height wont work because it wont have a height until its actually in the document
[10:02:08] <krambiorix> i have a table with in all table cells numbers... Is there any plugin to show, per row, a chart in background that row?
[10:04:14] <dmsuperman> m4strmind^: sure, CSS won't work in a detached document fragment, but the DOM itself still behaves like normal. good point though
[10:04:25] <dmsuperman> but it sounded like he wasn't trying to calculate any CSS from it
[10:06:04] <m4strmind^> :)
[10:06:21] <jop008> Now I use as first element of a select item this Choose bla. So the user knows what to do. But to do so I have to add a bla option and make it selected are there better ways to do this?
[10:10:31] <robertmaxrees> jop008 can you setup an example on a fiddle?
[10:10:52] <jop008> is my phrase not clear
[10:11:07] <robertmaxrees> i think I know what you mean, but having a working example would be cool.
[10:11:33] <jop008> you know a select box the user must know whtat to fill in so add an extra one at the first item and make it selected
[10:11:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:12:21] <robertmaxrees> go ask over in #frontend - they might have a good idea.
[10:14:58] <robertmaxrees> or ##frontend, rather
[10:16:24] <gnarf> jop008: the default is to select the first option
[10:16:32] <gnarf> jop008: no need to mark it selected
[10:16:35] <hooligan321> g
[10:17:09] <hooligan321> does jquery have a any loggin modes?
[10:17:36] <jop008> big fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/17/
[10:17:46] <dmsuperman> hooligan321: what do you mean
[10:17:52] <jop008> okay
[10:18:00] <jop008> let's change the fiddle
[10:18:30] <gnarf> adamellsworth: $("<div>").append( html ).find('selector').html(replacementHTML).end().html()
[10:18:31] <jop008> You are right
[10:18:33] <jop008> thx
[10:18:51] <hooligan321> dmsuperman i just by accident opened up jquery.migrate in my browser and saw a little lump of code talking about console.log("logging is enabled");
[10:19:39] <gnarf> hooligan321: jquery migrate has two versions - uncompressed has console.log's to warn you about deprecated uses
[10:19:52] <gnarf> compressed just plugs up the deprecated apis with no logging
[10:20:00] <hooligan321> aha right
[10:20:43] <jop008> when the list is longer I miss the first item
[10:20:56] <jop008> as a header
[10:21:46] <hooligan321> would jq migrate spew about getdefaultcomptedstyle in firefox ?
[10:21:55] <jop008> see second dropdown box
[10:22:05] <jop008> missing a header
[10:22:18] <robertmaxrees> jop008 fiddle doesn't autoupdate btw
[10:22:18] <gnarf> hooligan321: all the migrate warnings are obviously from migrate
[10:23:41] <jop008> autoupdate?
[10:23:46] <jop008> what do you mean
[10:24:01] <fschuindt> Guys, can you tell me why in this example only the "first" remove is working? http://jsfiddle.net/cso3mLcn/
[10:24:20] <jop008> this is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/19/
[10:24:34] <hooligan321> gnarf ok so that is probably just firefoxs js engine it self then or some unknown script as theres no mention of jqmigrate in that message but yeah just dont know where it comes from only get it on firefox and I have scoured my code feverishly and cant seem to find it atleast with out unminifying lots of third party stuff
[10:27:14] <m4strmind^> fschuindt, because your click event finds all .remove with the selector then attaches the event to each element
[10:27:37] <m4strmind^> a better solution is $(document).on("click", ".remove", function(){//code})
[10:28:04] <m4strmind^> that way you only attach one event to the document but it will fire for all elements with the remove class
[10:29:28] <fschuindt> m4strmind^: huum I see, thank you very much mate!
[10:30:11] <m4strmind^> anytime
[10:31:16] <hooligan321> jop008 whats wrong with that fiddle any way its works ok for me
[10:31:34] <jop008> I miss the header of the select what must user do?
[10:32:20] <hooligan321> the header? eloborate for me
[10:32:51] <hooligan321> elaborate even
[10:32:52] <hooligan321> lol
[10:33:14] <hooligan321> thats what i gt for trying to hang out with those big words
[10:34:36] <hooligan321> jop008 if any thing the header is `choose entity type`
[10:34:53] <RhinoBoss> How can I select a div on click, but prevent the items inside of it from triggering the event?  http://jsfiddle.net/65stt8y4/4/ <---- close but no cigar
[10:35:08] <hooligan321> if you mean a over all label then its just that <label for="selectbox">blabla
[10:35:43] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss bind a separate listener to the child elements and stopPropagation() on the event for those.
[10:36:08] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss or filiter the event target and see if it's the element you want.
[10:36:16] <robertmaxrees> *filter
[10:36:21] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: hm, ok - ill try this
[10:41:11] <jop008> I have no header
[10:41:28] <NinjaBanjo> ?
[10:41:47] <adamellsworth> http://jsbin.com/cumuweneloho/1/edit
[10:41:59] <adamellsworth> I can't seem to get the html to be replaced
[10:43:26] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth because you're rebuilding the fragment every time you pass through $()
[10:43:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/13rL381x/
[10:44:26] <NinjaBanjo> have to build the object in the dom first.
[10:44:30] <adamellsworth> oh man, I really can't believe it's that easy. Is the $ in front of the copy necessary?
[10:44:50] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth nope, but it'll help you remember that it's a jquery object.
[10:44:57] <robertmaxrees> helpful convention
[10:45:04] <adamellsworth> oh i see
[10:45:07] <adamellsworth> thanks
[10:45:14] <NinjaBanjo> you don't need the end either, its just another function call that doesnt need to happen
[10:45:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah why the .end()?
[10:45:49] <NinjaBanjo> `api end
[10:45:49] <b-ot> NinjaBanjo: .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[10:46:12] <NinjaBanjo> you don't plan on doing more changes do you? if not, theres no need for the end
[10:46:24] <adamellsworth> nope, just returning the new string
[10:46:29] <adamellsworth> *fragment
[10:46:29] <NinjaBanjo> then remove the end.
[10:46:50] <NinjaBanjo> it just calls another function that doesn't need to be called, can save the time/processing
[10:46:56] <robertmaxrees> yep
[11:00:53] <domino14> after many days i have finally narrowed down a horrible memory leak in my app to a .resize; i have a jquery div variable, if i do $var.resize(function() {}) it leaks memory (the DOM element never gets cleaned up by the garbage collector)
[11:00:58] <domino14> any help? why would that happen?
[11:02:24] <NinjaBanjo> domino14, can you provide a working example please?
[11:03:50] <robertmaxrees> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9358
[11:04:10] <robertmaxrees> maybe this is related?
[11:05:21] <domino14> maybe.. i am using jquery ui, but how would it know that? i commented out the jquery ui calls (so i don't do $div.resizable/ $div.draggable / etc and it still leaks)
[11:07:44] <robertmaxrees> .resize() is just a convenience method for .on('resize', function() {}) iirc, so there's likely something funny going on somewhere.
[11:08:22] <robertmaxrees> how are you removing the element?
[11:09:27] <domino14> robertmaxrees: basically $div.remove()
[11:09:48] <domino14> and i do some paranoid things before that, like set all the $div.data keys to null if they exist
[11:09:55] <domino14> i guess they're not paranoid
[11:10:32] <domino14> right, i also tried .on('resize', function() {}) and it still leaks. this is the offending line.
[11:10:53] <drej> leaks are usually offensive
[11:11:04] <domino14> yes quite
[11:11:09] <domino14> this one almost killed me
[11:11:10] <domino14> metaphorically
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> "basically div.remove() - could you clarify this?
[11:14:09] <domino14> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/30C8RQ3
[11:15:40] <robertmaxrees> iirc element.remove() does all of that for you.
[11:16:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it does.  why all the extra work up front?
[11:17:54] <domino14> robertmaxrees: right, i think it was out of paranoia
[11:18:19] <domino14> robertmaxrees: i tried also element.off() just now and it leaks still
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your stuff in action, but the GC is obviously holding only a reference somewhere.
[11:18:33] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[11:52:27] <domino14> i tried upgrading to the next jquery (2.1.1) and it still leakin'
[11:59:52] <NitroLiq> Hi All. I've been playing around with JS organization for my front-end boilerplate taking a 'drill-down' approach so basically there are three parts: In the document.ready, I'm calling an init() function. Next, I create the init() function which is where I call all the other functions. Then I create all the individual functions throughout the rest of the page. Any cons to doing it this way?
[12:02:22] <dmsuperman> NitroLiq: as opposed to what? what kinds of things are you putting in the init?
[12:05:06] <NitroLiq> Basically any functions I want once the DOM loads
[12:06:49] <NitroLiq> Saves on having multiple document.ready functions. Also allows me to start with a group of base functions I tend to use, where I can just comment them being called in the init function
[12:12:06] <hlvwrk> what would be the proper regex for ... lowercase alphanumeric that allows hyphen, and period, but has to start with a letter or number?
[12:19:30] <RhinoBoss> Theres gotta be a better way to get the id of a div in this simple scenario... right? http://jsfiddle.net/myd8mabq/5/
[12:20:32] <systemfault> lol yeah
[12:20:52] <systemfault> RhinoBoss http://jsfiddle.net/myd8mabq/6/
[12:21:26] <RhinoBoss> systemfault: lol thanks
[12:21:46] <systemfault> A more jQuery-ish way http://jsfiddle.net/myd8mabq/7/
[12:22:02] <systemfault> RhinoBoss ^
[12:22:12] <RhinoBoss> systemfault: that looks better - thanks again
[12:23:55] <clarkk> I know there is the $(window).resize() method, and that this takes a function. But how can I ensure that a function runs *after* the page has completely finished re-rendering?
[12:24:27] <robertmaxrees> you can't.  could you clarify what's happening in your case?
[12:24:58] <NinjaBanjo> clarkk, what is causing the page to re-render?
[12:25:13] <NinjaBanjo> robertmaxrees, sorry i missed your question
[12:25:16] <clarkk> NinjaBanjo: a window resize
[12:25:23] <clarkk> NinjaBanjo: by the user
[12:25:37] <robertmaxrees> clarkk what's breaking in your case?
[12:25:39] <NinjaBanjo> clarkk, a window resize won't make the page re-render, it just gets redrawn
[12:26:01] <clarkk> NinjaBanjo: ok, I meant redrawn
[12:26:19] <NinjaBanjo> clarkk, sorry i should specify, it will only redraw if you move an element. like .append or .after it
[12:26:28] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't have any real impact on any of of your code, clarkk
[12:26:51] <NinjaBanjo> robertmaxrees++ clarkk
[12:26:59] <clarkk> NinjaBanjo: yes, sorry to not explain fully - there is an element being inserted
[12:27:10] <NinjaBanjo> clarkk, can you expalin the issue?
[12:27:17] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle or something else would be nice :)
[12:27:23] <NinjaBanjo> agreed ^
[12:28:55] <clarkk> I'm using the jquery-waypoints plugin with the sticky shortcut to pin my nav to the top of the page. My nav is responsive, so horizontal in desktop mode and items stacked one on top of another in mobile mode....
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> are you hiding/showing things using jquery or media queries?
[12:30:22] <clarkk> when I resize the window and immediately add the sticky nav (ie a wrapper element around the nav that acts as a placeholder so that the page doesn't jump up when the nav becomes fixed, and out of the flow) the browser crashes.
[12:30:46] <clarkk> I can work around this reliably by using a settimeout, but I'd rather use a callback if possible
[12:31:00] <clarkk> *I mean, an event if there is one
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> woah, that crash sounds odd.
[12:31:59] <clarkk> I don't know waypoints.js well enough, and I'm not good enough, to debug it
[12:32:07] <clarkk> (the library)
[12:32:51] <robertmaxrees> that's probably not the faul of waypoints.
[12:32:54] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[12:32:59] <robertmaxrees> *fault
[12:33:50] <clarkk> I'd rather not share the html, but I could tidy up the js and share that
[12:33:57] <clarkk> robertmaxrees: would that be enough?
[12:34:02] <robertmaxrees> a small test case would be ide.a
[12:34:11] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're protective over the markup, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:34:27] <clarkk> I don't know how I would even start making it a small test case
[12:34:49] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net
[12:35:01] <clarkk> that's not what I meant
[12:36:05] <robertmaxrees> start simple.  add functionality one bit at a time until you get to where you need to be.
[12:36:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:36:36] <clarkk> to get back to my original question, there is no way to add a handler that runs after the repaint is complete, is that true?
[12:37:54] <NinjaBanjo> clarkk, there is not that I know of..
[12:38:06] <clarkk> ok, thankyou NinjaBanjo
[12:41:06] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:41:47] <robertmaxrees> clarkk yeah, there's no "repaint/redraw" complete handler.  it sounds like you've got something else going on.
[12:42:13] <clarkk> ok, thank you robertmaxrees. I'll go through my code again
[12:42:23] <robertmaxrees> if you want us to take a look, let us know :)
[12:43:41] <clarkk> thank you robertmaxrees - sorry, I wasn't meaning to be difficult. If I can whittle the code down, I will. But I'll try auditing my own code first
[12:43:49] <robertmaxrees> def.
[12:51:44] <uskerine> hi, I am getting a weird message at linux console (not at the javascript console): @@@@Assignments for getNumberWithPercentage.str 16
[12:51:46] <the8thbit|work> With this library: www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/
[12:52:00] <the8thbit|work> is there a way to send more data through the get request?
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> uskerine probably get more help elsewhere :)
[12:52:11] <uskerine> where getNumberWithPercentage is a javascript function I am using in a web app I am developing and str a  variable used in that function
[12:52:15] <the8thbit|work> Or change it to post? (the second question is less important, but it would be nice)
[12:52:34] <uskerine> any idea on why this could be happening?
[12:52:36] <the8thbit|work> I need to send my session ID for DB stuff
[12:52:47] <uskerine> robertmaxrees maybe #javascript?
[12:52:57] <robertmaxrees> uskerine maybe?
[12:53:32] <uskerine> I'll try, anyway many chaps here know javascript too, and it is quite weird message
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> uskerine sounds like an error with linux, not javascript?
[12:53:52] <uskerine> I am not sure
[12:54:08] <uskerine> something is triggering that message, and comes from my javascript function
[12:54:16] <uskerine> but it is displayed in linux console
[12:54:53] <uskerine> hi, I am getting a weird message at linux console (not at the javascript console): @@@@Assignments for getNumberWithPercentage.str 16 where getNumberWithPercentage is a javascript function I am using in a web app I am developing and str a  variable used in that function
[12:54:55] <uskerine> sorry
[12:55:00] <uskerine> that was for #javascript
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> uskerine is this a node thing, ooorrr?
[12:57:18] <uskerine> ?? what do you mean with node thing?
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand how you'te getting a JS error in the linux console...
[12:57:39] <uskerine> that's why I am trying to do too
[12:57:43] <uskerine> what*
[12:57:48] <uskerine> I am totally puzzled
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing to trigger the error?
[12:57:56] <uskerine> nothing AFAIK
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:58:08] <uskerine> so I mean, I did not try to do that
[12:58:09] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up.
[12:58:29] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing when you get that error?  you just open a terminal and there it is?
[12:58:43] <uskerine> I launch firefox on linux console normally (firefox &)
[12:58:56] <uskerine> and after a while working I came back to the console and I realized I was getting that error
[12:59:03] <uskerine> it is clearly being redirected by firefox to stderr
[12:59:19] <uskerine> and of course it has to do with my web app as the name of the function and variable matches
[12:59:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see more i guess.
[12:59:48] <uskerine> would you like to see the function?
[12:59:59] <uskerine> it is a bit messy but it has nothing special
[13:00:09] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[13:01:17] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/ZTC0KZgq
[13:03:52] <robertmaxrees> still confused about how you're getting in-browser js errors through the terminal.
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:03:55] <uskerine> following the function might be cumbersome, but as you see there is no big deal with it, it is just plain javascript. I can't see anything weird
[13:04:13] <uskerine> so I am, but they appear
[13:04:19] <uskerine> and it is just that message
[13:04:23] <uskerine> never saw anything like that
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to read all of it ;)
[13:06:45] <uskerine> I am sure you won't, it is difficult to read even for me
[13:06:48] <uskerine> (i wrote it)
[13:06:54] <robertmaxrees> what is it trying to do?
[13:06:59] <uskerine> but at a glance, there is nothing magic on it
[13:07:06] <uskerine> just plain if's and .replaces
[13:07:14] <uskerine> it is trying to be smart while reading a number
[13:07:29] <uskerine> so you type 1,000.223 that's 1000.23
[13:07:36] <uskerine> you type 1.000,23   that's 1000.23
[13:07:47] <uskerine> you type 1.234% that's 1.234%
[13:07:50] <uskerine> and so on
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> so it's trying to parse numbers in varois formats?
[13:08:20] <uskerine> right
[13:08:45] <uskerine> the user types rubbish mixing locales and the function does its best to figure out what the user actually means
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[13:09:04] <uskerine> in my country you will find both people using . and , for decimal point
[13:09:19] <uskerine> it depends on your exposure to foreign languages
[13:09:26] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not using a library for that?
[13:09:31] <uskerine> :-o
[13:09:34] <uskerine> is there any library?
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of the internationalization concept.
[13:10:03] <uskerine> I did not know of any library who could do that
[13:10:09] <robertmaxrees> http://software.dzhuvinov.com/jsworld.html
[13:10:10] <uskerine> otherwise I am not writing anything by myself
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> just searching around google.
[13:10:35] <robertmaxrees> there's likely something that already does this.
[13:10:50] <robertmaxrees> oh that needs a license haha
[13:11:09] <uskerine> I am not sure
[13:11:18] <uskerine> this one deals both with % and absolute numbers
[13:11:38] <uskerine> it is very specific to a couple of data entry cells
[13:11:41] <robertmaxrees> so the other question is "why" - what's the use case?
[13:12:36] <uskerine> as i told you I am trying to guess when , or . are used as  decimal point or thousand separator
[13:12:47] <robertmaxrees> right - but why?
[13:12:53] <uskerine> because the user will mix that
[13:13:01] <uskerine> some users will use one criteria and others another
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> is this a calculator app?
[13:13:11] <robertmaxrees> use case/application are relevant :)
[13:13:22] <uskerine> no, but the data is used to work out another number
[13:13:28] <uskerine> so you need the actual numeric value
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> that's a dangerous idea btw.
[13:13:47] <robertmaxrees> check out math.js and see if that can help.
[13:13:55] <robertmaxrees> math in js is a scary, scary thing.
[13:14:11] <uskerine> most web stuff assume that people are stuck to their locales
[13:14:14] <uskerine> but reality is that they are not
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> just providing you some suggestions duder.
[13:14:49] <uskerine> I'll check both the library you suggested and the math.js
[13:14:50] <uskerine> thanks
[13:15:02] <uskerine> but anyway I am still wondering why firefox displays that message
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno there.
[13:15:27] <uskerine> I'll try in another firefox version
[13:15:51] <uskerine> sometimes those things appear and disappear magically
[13:21:30] <SlexAxton> icu numberformat is probably what you want
[13:21:43] <SlexAxton> the data comes from the CLDR i18n database
[13:21:52] <SlexAxton> and is parsed to allow you to format numbers
[13:22:00] <SlexAxton> based on the country of origin of the number
[13:22:06] <SlexAxton> vs. the country of the viewer
[13:22:37] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jedtoolkit/numberformat.js/ ?
[13:26:26] <phoenixsun> what is the best approach to creating clickable search results? When results need to have a button for each result.
[13:27:57] <phoenixsun> do I programatically generate id's for each result's div and then programatically bind the element to an onclick function?
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use a delegated listener for the button's click evemt
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> and give them all a shared class.
[13:33:30] <phoenixsun> I will have to see if I can find a good example
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> of a delegated listener?
[13:33:38] <phoenixsun> thanks for the direction though.
[13:33:46] <drej> <-- delegated listener
[13:33:48] <phoenixsun> of it being used in the fashion that I want to
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('click', 'child', function() {});
[13:34:30] <robertmaxrees> inside of that, the `this` object is whatever was clicked.
[13:38:39] <dunkel2> hello
[13:39:21] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: I will try an implementation and see how I go
[13:43:25] <uskerine> I use that approach and works fine for me, the element ID is in a hidden table cell and the button element goes to a generic delegated listener which gets that ID from the 'this' object
[13:44:29] <phoenixsun> right thats what I need it to do
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can use whatever you want from the clicked element.
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> but no need to attach more than one listener.
[13:45:48] <uskerine> no, only one and it handles all item buttons
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> yep\
[13:45:53] <uskerine> and then you read the right ID
[13:46:04] <uskerine> (buttons or whatever you are using of course)
[14:12:24] <RhinoBoss> whats the quickest way to get the class names of the element in this little example? http://jsfiddle.net/f95suf5s/6/
[14:13:40] <RhinoBoss> i really just need to have a way to use .hasClass()
[14:14:09] <thinkxl> RhinoBoss: $(this).attr('class');
[14:14:47] <RhinoBoss> thinkxl: hm, yah  thats one way
[14:14:51] <robertmaxrees> .prop('class') is another.
[14:15:13] <whateverinos> hey anyone know what the error in js chrome console is here? — https://api-bits.firebaseapp.com — i dont get it locally https://github.com/tejas-manohar/api-bits
[14:15:20] <RhinoBoss> which is preferred? prop or attr?
[14:15:29] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss also $(this).hasClass();
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> prop is generally what you wanbt.
[14:15:51] <thinkxl> RhinoBoss: what robertmaxrees said
[14:15:57] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: thanks... for the hundredth time!
[14:16:02] <RhinoBoss> lol
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:16:13] <thinkxl> RhinoBoss: he get paid by freenode, so ask what you want
[14:16:15] <robertmaxrees> thanks for giving me a brief mental break.
[14:16:19] <robertmaxrees> lol nah i don't.
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you think I do.
[14:16:24] <RhinoBoss> ohh lol
[14:17:01] <robertmaxrees> gonna keep tellin' people that, huh?
[14:17:02] <robertmaxrees> :)\
[14:17:17] <thinkxl> haha
[14:17:41] <thinkxl> not anymore, no worries :P
[14:20:47] <dunkel2> hello, is there a way to detect when a test area is full of text?
[14:20:58] <robertmaxrees> "is full of text"?
[14:21:26] <dunkel2> yeah when the input text reached the bottom edge and the right edge
[14:21:30] <dunkel2> without scrolling
[14:21:58] <robertmaxrees> you can set a maxlengh property or detect if a scrollbar exists after keyup.
[14:22:27] <dunkel2> can i detect the scrollbar then? how can i do that?
[14:22:54] <whateverinos> yo
[14:22:59] <dunkel2> sup
[14:22:59] <whateverinos> https://api-bits.firebaseapp.com/#/
[14:23:02] <whateverinos> any way to track down
[14:23:04] <whateverinos> the error in console
[14:23:05] <robertmaxrees> the "size" of the text isn't very useful imo - can you elaborate on what you're trying to do dunkel2 ?
[14:23:07] <whateverinos> to a specific file
[14:23:25] <robertmaxrees> whateverinos there should be a link to the right.
[14:23:55] <whateverinos> robertmaxrees: not exactly in this case, maybe you wanna take a look?
[14:24:05] <robertmaxrees> i did and saw a link.
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> it's in the middle of what looks to be a big minified file.
[14:24:32] <whateverinos> robertmaxrees:yea...
[14:25:13] <robertmaxrees> if you don't have a source map, it's kind of hard to figure it out for you.
[14:25:16] <dunkel2> robertmaxrees: i want to create some printable pages, but detecting a specific length of the text to cut it and create a new page, so when the user prints it, it couls be as accurate as a normal printed form and not just a long field splitted in two pages by the printer
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> dunkel2 are you in control of the page, or is it any end user's?
[14:26:32] <whateverinos> robertmaxrees: way to add a sourcemap?
[14:26:44] <whateverinos> https://github.com/tejas-manohar/api-bits
[14:26:45] <dunkel2> i am, first it was a pdf, but i found a laravel’s component to make pdfs from html so i think i can generate templates for each page
[14:26:47] <whateverinos> used a yeoman generator
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> whateverinos http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/ start here i guess.
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> dunkel2 http://stackoverflow.com/a/2648063/923919
[14:27:43] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:28:25] <dunkel2> does that work for the textarea too?
[14:28:37] <robertmaxrees> you could try and see.
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> not sure.  just tossing out ideas :)
[14:29:28] <unnotused> is there a way to check for the disabled prop on a select drop down?
[14:29:42] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled')
[14:29:45] <dunkel2> ok, ill try robertmaxrees thanks
[14:33:06] <phoenixsun> is there a jquery way to turn of a browsers autocomplete function of an input form cos the html way doesn't seem to be working
[14:33:13] <phoenixsun> ?
[14:34:05] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[14:34:13] <beachandbytes> form.setAttribute('autocomplete','off');
[14:34:31] <robertmaxrees> because you might need it on both the form AND inputs
[14:34:31] <beachandbytes> or autocomplete=off in html
[14:34:41] <beachandbytes> ya good point robert
[14:35:01] <unnotused> what i wanna do is if the option is disabled and selected (haven't selected anything yet) then make it grey, if you click on it make it colorful and yay
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> unnotused you can enable it on click, though that's really odd.
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> since disabled generally signals they are not able to interact with it.
[14:48:34] <stef1a> i'm trying to select an element on the page that looks like <a href="#" class="col-sm-1 radio-input-edit">...</a>. when i try to use $('.radio-input-edit').click(function(event) { ... });, nothing in the brackets happens when i click the href; i just get bumped to the top of the page. help?
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> run event.preventDefault()
[14:50:00] <robertmaxrees> does that link exist on pageload?
[14:50:55] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: no. i think that's the problem: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16893057/3723769
[14:51:06] <stef1a> i'm adding the a href dynamically
[14:51:24] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[14:51:57] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('click', '.radio-input-edit', function(e) {e.preventDefault(); });
[14:52:10] <robertmaxrees> where `parent` is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[14:52:24] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: thanks. using document also helps
[14:52:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using document or body if you can.
[14:53:25] <stef1a> why?
[14:53:43] <robertmaxrees> binding to document means that every single click must be filtered to see if it matches the one you want.
[14:53:55] <robertmaxrees> binding lower to a more relevant part of the page reduces that
[14:53:58] <stef1a> oh, i see.
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> minor performance difference.
[14:55:24] <stef1a> thanks a lot :-)
[14:55:28] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:07:41] <phoenixsun> beachandbytes: I tried autocomplete=off. It didn't work in Chrome or Safari . robertmaxrees
[15:10:19] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun on both the form AND the inputs?
[15:11:17] <phoenixsun> well the form
[15:11:19] <phoenixsun> I think
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> try doing both
[15:12:30] <phoenixsun> ahhh
[15:12:52] <phoenixsun> actually I had done it only on the input but now thats its on both its working
[15:12:55] <phoenixsun> awesome
[15:13:19] <phoenixsun> it was spoiling my reasonably operational search by obscuring the results a little
[15:26:41] <imjakechapman> hey everyone
[15:27:57] <imjakechapman> I'm trying to set animation-duration on a jquery element, but firefox just won't let it show up... http://laravel.io/bin/aGMnq
[15:28:14] <imjakechapman> I've added that bottom little bit to see if doing it that way would work
[15:28:34] <imjakechapman> chrome and safari both render the style attribute as "-webkit-animation: somespeedvalue;"
[15:28:38] <imjakechapman> but firefox is empty. Ideas?
[15:31:08] <HowardwLo> anyone know a scrollbar plugin that allows position relative?
[15:31:25] <HowardwLo> I’m using perfect-scroll bar, but im finding a need to use position relative on my elements :(
[16:08:29] <aphorise> Is there a .on event I can bind for all / any actions? - I'm trying to deal with a 3rd Party iFrame - trying to figure out how I can bind to it after its done its stuff.
[17:02:18] <stefano> hello. I've been trying to get this working the whole evening, could you please help me finding what's wrong? http://pastebin.com/q600buVv
[17:03:16] <shoky> stefano: either put your <script> at the end of the <body> part, or put $(document).ready(function() { ... }) around your code
[17:04:02] <aphorise> Is there a .on event I can bind for all / any actions? -
[17:04:07] <shoky> no
[17:04:54] <shoky> especially not for cross-domain iframes
[17:05:09] <aphorise> u saw my earlier question?  :-)
[17:05:20] <shoky> it's right there in front of me ;p
[17:05:49] <aphorise> Any ideas how can I can trigger afterload action for iframes?
[17:06:04] <stefano> shoky $(document) ... around the entire block?
[17:06:20] <shoky> stefano:  what i wrote, yes
[17:06:39] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[17:07:03] <shoky> stefano: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:07:59] <stefano> shoky sorry it's the first time I mess up with js/jquery. if I'm not asking too much could you paste me what you mean? tried what you said but didn't worked
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> stefano show us what you tried.
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:09:20] <aphorise> stefano  $(document).ready(function(){  alert("I am ready"); });
[17:11:02] <stefano> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/n883RT2y
[17:11:41] <stefano> It's the first time I'm looking at js code, sorry
[17:12:02] <stefano> let me show you the working example I'm trying to import in a page
[17:12:02] <aphorise> stefano  you are missing  });  at end
[17:12:33] <aphorise> you have just  )   where it shoud be  )};
[17:13:27] <stefano> here's the example http://codepen.io/johnmotyljr/pen/qhvue
[17:14:57] <stefano> I changed last line from ) to )}; but still nothing
[17:15:21] <robertmaxrees> });
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> also it's $(document).ready(function() {});
[17:16:49] <stefano> yep added a { at the beginning and now works fine!

[17:17:38] * aphorise ponders over iframe interactions
[17:18:01] <stefano> well, I thought lua had the most ugly syntax but maybe jquery wins the prize :P
[17:18:11] <stefano> thanks people :)
[17:18:23] <robertmaxrees> stefano *javascript.
[17:18:23] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> and it makes sense once you understand the basics.
[17:32:48] <uskerine> hi, in a textarea, if I load the data from the beginning, I can see it in the DOM, however when I modify something in that textarea, changes do not appear in DOM, why?
[17:33:45] <uskerine> by "load the data from the beginning" I mean using .load
[17:43:10] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: hi robert, just to thank you for your help yesterday, I pass that blocking point thanks to you. I am now working on filtering that data, I found out that JS has a method for that, so that's going to be my day
[18:06:46] <jrockjiggz> i noticed height() isn't including padding?
[18:07:55] <jrockjiggz> google chrome shows the elements dimensions, where $('el').height is of less height
[18:08:50] <jrockjiggz> ah.. outerHeight()
[18:40:47] <Keavon> I have four <a> tags grouped in several different divs. I need to find the index of a specific <a> tag that is clicked on, not in the parent div, but the index of this <a> compared to the other <a>s inside the grandparent
[18:42:09] <Keavon> http://jsfiddle.net/nwv6khsx/
[18:42:21] <Keavon> That's the HTML structure
[18:42:37] <Keavon> if I click the third <a> tag, I need to get an index of 2
[18:47:06] <dianne_> hello guys
[18:49:49] <dianne_> i have question about jquery and json coz i'm just a beginner and i think you guys can help me.. this code http://txs.io/Dtqb gets me an error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 2 column 1 of the JSON data
[18:50:55] <dianne_> hi.. please help me with my question above.. thank you..
[18:55:47] <NinjaBanjo> dianne_, the problem is most likely with the json being returned form the server. the code you pasted looks fine.
[18:55:59] <romangineer> hi
[18:56:12] <NinjaBanjo> dianne_, i would take a look at the code being returned from the server using something like this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en
[18:56:31] <NinjaBanjo> hi romangineer
[19:04:00] <dianne_> NinjaBanjo, when i try to replace line: errors = jQuery.parseJSON(data);  with jQuery.parseJSON('{"curpword":"qwe","newpword":"asd","reppword":"zxc"}');  it works...
[19:04:26] <dianne_> when i alert the data, it returns html codes
[19:05:42] <NinjaBanjo> dianne_, thats most likely the issue. if you try and run non JSON through parseJSON it will fail like it does in your code
[19:07:38] <dianne_> NinjaBanjo, yes you're right.. but how can i get this data '{"curpword":"qwe","newpword":"asd","reppword":"zxc"}' that prints on the page without the html codes
[19:08:01] <NinjaBanjo> dianne_, where is the data coming from? what language is your backend?
[19:08:39] <dianne_> NinjaBanjo, i'm using cakephp framework..
[19:08:50] <NinjaBanjo> see here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[19:09:10] <NinjaBanjo> php function, you can pass it an array. then echo te return of json_encode
[19:09:42] <NinjaBanjo> make sure you are not echoing any <html> or <body> or anything, all that should come thorough is the {json: 'here'}
[19:09:44] <dianne_> the data came from controller.. then prints it on view.. that view only prints this data {"curpword":"qwe","newpword":"asd","reppword":"zxc"}
[19:10:02] <NinjaBanjo> but does it print any html tags to the page as well? dianne_
[19:10:14] <NinjaBanjo> the html tags will mess things up
[19:10:34] <NinjaBanjo> if you can;t figure it out within cake, i would consult ##php
[19:11:22] <NinjaBanjo> if you use postman that i posted before, you can see exactly whats being returned when you query that url
[19:13:00] <dianne_> NinjaBanjo, i made it work now.. thank you!! cakephp has a default view that prints html tags automatically i just removed it..
[19:13:16] <NinjaBanjo> wonderfun, glad i could help dianne_
[19:13:20] <NinjaBanjo> wonderful*
[19:14:01] <dianne_> i mean i removed the default layout for that page.. thanks again
[19:36:43] <Jagst3r21> hmm,,,I am trying to get this modal to load on page load..any idea why its not working?
[19:36:47] <Jagst3r21> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/puxJF
[19:37:32] <Jagst3r21> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/puxJF actually
[19:39:02] <voronika> does codepen have jquery loaded?
[19:39:58] <Jagst3r21> I believe so
[19:40:51] <voronika> yea, it looks like it.  interesting.  i'd swear someone said something about it the other day.
[19:44:48] <Jagst3r21> voronika any idea whats up with it?
[19:47:13] <voronika> you have your modal-box hidden by setting the opacity to 0, rather than a display:none;
[19:47:33] <voronika> show isn't changing your opacity; instead it's trying to unhide it, but when it unhides, it's at a 0 opacity.
[19:47:52] <Jagst3r21> :O
[19:48:29] <Jagst3r21> that is a simple fix
[19:48:37] <Jagst3r21> thanks for catching it :)
[19:52:45] <voronika> no problem
[20:19:57] <Jagst3r21> hmm one last thing, any idea why I cant click the close button? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/puxJF
[20:41:18] <voronika>   pointer-events: none;
[20:41:34] <voronika> on your #modal-box
[21:32:29] <jotterbot> how does one check multiple strings in an if statement?
[21:33:21] <jotterbot> eg. from "if(checkBunch[i].innerHTML == "Video") {" to something like "if(checkBunch[i].innerHTML == "(Video|Image|OtherValue)") {" ?
[21:41:05] <motaka3> hello can anyone please tell me what is the problem on this page? I get an error about jquery u can see it when using firebug.  http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[21:50:53] <Uhkis> motaka3: remove extra scripts one by one to see where the problem is
[22:05:57] <uskerine> hi
[22:06:05] <jpwillis> hi
[22:06:56] <uskerine> how should I set up the value for a <textarea> and later retrieve it? (so I load it via AJAX on document ready, user may or may not modify it, and then I upload it again to the server when user press another button)
[22:09:53] <uskerine> Should it be  .val(), .text(), .html()?
[22:11:04] <vdeep> it should be .val()
[22:12:38] <uskerine> both for set value and retrieve?
[22:13:31] <uskerine> I will check it
[22:13:35] <uskerine> thanks
[22:17:38] <uskerine> I was using .text() and .html() during retrieval, is .val() for both
[22:17:43] <uskerine> thanks
[22:33:03] <vdeep> yes, .val() is for both
[22:34:02] <vdeep> .val() with no arguments will set the value and without any argument it will get the value
[22:34:31] <vdeep> oh sorry, I wrote wrong.. :P
[22:34:45] <vdeep> without argument = get, with argument = set
[22:41:09] <uskerine> I got it
