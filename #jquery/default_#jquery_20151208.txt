[01:05:33] <veek> what exactly is event delegation: event-capturing, bubbling
[01:05:58] <veek> "Event delegation and handling in jQuery refers to the execution of events by attaching event
[01:05:58] <veek> listeners to objects that wait for events to bubble up the through the elements in the DOM. "
[01:06:20] <veek> i didn't follow the "objects that wait for events"
[01:30:15] <Cork> veek: it is referring to how events move through the dom when it fires
[01:30:53] <Cork> veek: in capturing mode the event goes from document up to the top most element
[01:31:17] <Cork> veek: and later it bubbles up from the target element to the document
[01:32:06] <Cork> veek: and object in the sentence is just a more generic reference to the dom element you've bound the event handler to
[01:42:41] <veek> thanks Cork
[02:11:45] <veek> programmatically what's interface EventTarget { } a struct with 3 function pointers?
[05:00:29] <axscode> https://jsfiddle.net/do8n4ozs/
[05:00:50] <axscode> Hi guys, how can i wrap all li's all together using jquery?
[05:01:23] <Cork> axscode: your second drop isn't valid
[05:01:37] <axscode> aw...
[05:01:38] <Cork> div isn't valid as a child of ul
[05:01:48] <axscode> whats valid as wrapper?
[05:01:49] <Cork> and li isn't valid as a child of anything other then ul or ol
[05:01:54] <Cork> ul or ol
[05:02:26] <Cork> a valid structure is <ul class="drop2"><li><ul><li>one</il></ul></li></ul>
[05:02:57] <Cork> or <div class="drop2"><ul><li></li></ul></div>
[05:03:15] <axscode> ah ok got it sounds logical. so question is how to wrap it with li and ul?
[05:04:18] <axscode> i was reading .wrap() but seems usable for one element not group of elements.
[05:05:57] <tasaif> mods are asleep, post the terminal emulators that let you ctrl+# to switch tabs
[05:06:03] <tasaif> like in chrome
[05:07:58] <Cork> axscode: https://jsfiddle.net/do8n4ozs/1/
[05:08:22] <Cork> axscode: i've never been able to like wrap and wrapAll
[05:09:33] <Cork> axscode: actually this could be even simpler :) https://jsfiddle.net/do8n4ozs/2/
[05:10:22] <axscode> hmmm ok
[05:10:49] <axscode> thanks a lot, i got it. so ill just use prepend and append.
[05:14:14] <Cork> axscode: also remember that you should not append to the existing dom first
[05:14:30] <Cork> instead build a fragment out of dom and then append it to the dom when your done modifying it
[05:14:36] <Cork> (that is what the code i gave you does)
[05:22:43] <axscode> Hi Cork, any thought on this -> https://jsfiddle.net/do8n4ozs/3/
[05:23:30] <axscode> ah it works, just forgot to remove .main-nav
[05:25:20] <Cork> axscode: hmm, that doesn't do anything
[05:25:23] <Cork> not sure why right now
[05:26:03] <Cork> ah, the selector doesn't match anything
[05:26:04] <axscode> i just removed the .main-nav there's no main-nav
[05:26:18] <lianzinho> guys, I have a menu plugin, which I’m trying to layout, but it does not keep opened… I’ve managed to add a class but it removes it and all the styling in mouse-out… so… how can I identify AND remove the mouse-out event that fires this class removal?
[05:26:24] <axscode> thanks Cork
[05:26:47] <axscode> Cork, will this work on tablets and mobiles?
[05:26:48] <Cork> axscode: https://jsfiddle.net/do8n4ozs/4/
[05:27:01] <Cork> you added the ul as a sibling not as a parent
[05:27:18] <Cork> axscode: it will do the same dom modification sure
[05:27:26] <Cork> not sure if you meant to ask that though
[05:30:51] <axscode> our codes makes ul and li as siblings not ul as parent
[05:31:00] <axscode> well. the rendered html :(
[05:42:53] <axscode> ah perfect
[05:42:56] <axscode> thanks
[06:28:36] <Mark___> does anybody know the reason why jquery.load will load only few parts of the css file that's linked inside what’s loading it?
[06:29:00] <Mark___> *it loading
[06:41:24] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys.. using jquery if a gridview exceeds a 'DIV' I animate it and scroll up and down.. then refreshes the sites..  works perfect.        BUT! if the gridview doesn't exceed the div.. it won't ever animate, which means it won't ever refresh! ... trying to work around this by going: if ($d.not(':animated')) { window.location = document.URL; }
[06:41:30] <P3nnyw1se> but it doesn't register the animation.. it just refreshes no matter what in the middle of the animation
[06:52:26] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys..  $('.wrapper').filter(':not(:animated)').  { "Do Something" }   ... no matter if my animation is running or not.. I get the 'do something' every time...
[07:08:18] <hellyeah> this attr('disabled','disabled') is suggested but doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/6pr74p5q/5/
[07:08:30] <hellyeah> i want to disable button when click once
[07:26:01] <Cork> hellyeah: never ever use attr for element state
[07:26:16] <Cork> hellyeah: or simpler only use .attr if .prop gives you the wrong answer
[07:26:33] <Cork> what you want in this case is .prop('disabled', true/false)
[07:26:34] <hellyeah> prop
[07:27:03] <hellyeah> let me check
[07:28:11] <hellyeah> Cork: thanks but i just want to disable pervious button https://jsfiddle.net/6pr74p5q/8/
[07:28:17] <hellyeah> it disable all add button
[07:28:24] <Cork> well then you have to select that button
[07:28:43] <hellyeah> i suppose div will select it
[07:28:45] <hellyeah> ops
[07:28:46] <hellyeah> this
[07:30:16] <hellyeah> i mean "this" keyword
[07:30:35] <Cork> this selects the current element in the context
[07:30:38] <Cork> not the previous
[07:31:16] <hellyeah> humm
[07:32:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:36:40] <hellyeah> Cork: it is off to top of my head
[07:36:44] <hellyeah> can you give me tips?
[07:37:12] <Cork> i'm not sure what context your asking about
[07:37:25] <Cork> btw just noticed you don't define your variables
[07:37:29] <Cork> they are all globals...
[07:37:38] <hellyeah> i will fix it
[07:37:43] <Cork> (haven't we talked about this numerous times?)
[07:38:04] <Cork> also clone = $(buttonDiv.html()); => var clone buttonDiv.clone()
[07:38:07] <Cork> opps
[07:38:10] <Cork> also clone = $(buttonDiv.html()); => var clone = buttonDiv.clone()
[07:38:29] <Cork> no reason to serialize it to html if you just want to clone it
[07:38:57] <hellyeah> ic
[07:39:18] <hellyeah> the only thing i want when you add element i want to disable pervious add button
[07:40:17] <Cork> O_o
[07:40:25] <Cork> if you don't want it usable why duplicate them?
[07:40:25] <hellyeah> you dont understand hmm
[07:40:41] <hellyeah> actually this is just for trying
[07:40:50] <hellyeah> i will put calendar instead of button
[07:41:04] <hellyeah> i want to create multiple calendar with add button
[07:41:23] <hellyeah> when you add second calendar. I want create third calendar with add button in second position
[07:41:43] <hellyeah> and if i want to remove calendar i want to click remove button
[07:41:56] <hellyeah> this is really simple bootstrap datapicker example
[07:42:30] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:30:32] <gju> how do you go about passing urls to your scripts?
[08:30:45] <gju> when using a template engine for example.

[09:18:07] <hellyeah> yo
[09:31:25] <ahoo> is there a way to get a list of all jquery plugins that are loaded?
[09:31:46] <ahoo> wait, never mind.
[09:31:56] <ahoo> do jquery plugins globally register with jquery?
[09:42:20] <Cork> ahoo: $.fn and $ will contain the public apis for the plugins
[09:42:41] <Cork> if they haven't registered on any of those they aren't a jquery plugin
[09:43:04] <Cork> ahoo: though note there are no list of the plugins
[10:03:05] <ThiefMaster> weird, jquery doesn't support .css('color', '#... !important')?!
[10:04:52] <nru> hi :)
[10:17:13] <ahoo> thx
[10:17:25] <ahoo> how do i animate backgroundColor?
[10:17:34] <ahoo> with jQ only
[10:21:19] <nru> anyone any idea why my code does not arrive at alert("test1") http://jsfiddle.net/x27jv1fn/1/
[10:22:46] <Foxhoundz> nru: add .val()
[10:22:50] <Foxhoundz> on line
[10:22:52] <Foxhoundz> 4
[10:23:25] <nru> i see :)
[10:23:32] <Foxhoundz> oh nvm
[10:23:33] <nru> and if i want to change the item value is line 12 ok ?
[10:23:50] <ThiefMaster> ahoo: why not use css transitions?
[10:24:11] <ahoo> ThiefMaster: because i haven't had time to get into css transitions :)
[10:24:45] <nru> Foxhoundz your solution works:)
[10:35:09] <nru> fixed the multiple changes on fields with same class name
[10:35:10] <nru> http://jsfiddle.net/x27jv1fn/4/
[10:35:10] <nru> :D

[11:08:00] <berezovsky> actual code is onlick method

[11:08:14] <NoiseEee> berezovsky: show your code.
[12:29:47] <jquery639> Hi. Can someone check this : http://jsfiddle.net/7L4WZ/551/
[12:30:08] <robertmaxrees> what is $this supposed to be?
[12:30:30] <jquery639> if text is == 1 it should show div
[12:30:36] <robertmaxrees> you need .each() then.
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:32:37] <robertmaxrees> and you probably want .text(), not .html()
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> and you want to use ===, not ==
[12:33:35] <jquery639> hmm.. like this --> http://jsfiddle.net/7L4WZ/555/
[12:33:54] <robertmaxrees> how does it know which box3 to use?
[12:33:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> also, if(this.text()).length == 1) has an extra closing paren.
[12:34:32] <jquery639> .close('p') ?
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> and .text() is a jquery method, not a native dom method.
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> errr, .close()?
[12:34:53] <jquery639> find I ment =)
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:35:05] <robertmaxrees> usually people use $(this) or pass the second arg to the .each() callback./
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is the native DOM element - you need to pass it to jquery to get the jquery methods on it.
[12:35:43] <jquery639> like this --> http://jsfiddle.net/7L4WZ/556/
[12:36:06] <robertmaxrees> open your console - you still have an extra closing paren on that line i mentioned earlier.
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7L4WZ/557/ you want something like this instead
[12:36:58] <jquery639> is that the shortest way ?
[12:37:17] <robertmaxrees> you could use an anonymous function if you wanted, but that's less readable imo.
[12:37:36] <taplar> if none of them start with show that need to be removed, you could use filter()
[12:37:47] <jquery639> ok, just though it could do in less coding :P
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery639 it COULD be done with less code, but less !== better.
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> anonymous functions suck because i have no idea what you intend that code to do at a glance.
[12:38:30] <jquery639> okey =)
[12:38:55] <jquery639> this works fine
[12:38:59] <jquery639> thx =)
[12:52:57] <taplar> slow day
[12:53:01] <robertmaxrees> very
[12:53:40] <taplar> i've had like meetings all morning
[12:55:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm so glad my company doesn't abuse meetings.
[12:58:27] <taplar> lol https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/12299291_625637450908250_7559564733098108440_n.jpg?oh=dd61374b5013bb4ff4c16f76dfe22c51&oe=56FA74F6
[12:58:39] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:54:44] <s2013> i have bunch of checkboxes, each checbox has an unique data attribute.. so when someone selects multiplle checkboxes and hit a button it shoulds serialize those data ids and post it to a form.. best way to do it?
[14:54:53] <s2013> i can sort of do it but it will end up looking very messy i feel there is a better way?
[14:55:04] <robertmaxrees> what would you do?
[14:55:55] <s2013> well loop through all the checkboxes and find the ones that has the prop of checked.. add the data attr for that to an array.. and then post using that array
[14:56:12] <robertmaxrees> you're close.  you could just use .map()
[14:56:58] <s2013> doesnt map still itetrate through each array and then just change its value?
[14:57:24] <s2013> but i guess i can do something like var checked_ids = ..map
[15:25:35] <Kartagis> $('.webform-client-form-97 #validationErrorMail').html('E-posta adresi uygun değil.  Bu e-posta size ait ise <a href="/user?destination=".<?php echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URL']?>lütfen giriş yapınız.</a>'); <--- if this isn't possible, what's the equivalent?
[15:26:13] <NoiseEee> Kartagis: don't paste PHP code, paste what the browser gets.
[15:27:26] <Kartagis> NoiseEee: I was just asking if that's possible
[15:27:47] <NoiseEee> sure, its possible to update the DOM using .html()
[15:28:09] <NoiseEee> your selector is goofy, i don't understand the .webform stuff before #validationErrorMail
[15:28:42] <Kartagis> but, is it possible to use PHP inside .html() ?
[15:30:28] <NoiseEee> Kartagis: it all depends on what PHP outputs
[15:30:37] <NoiseEee> if it outputs bad syntax or something, then no
[15:30:45] <NoiseEee> this is why I said "paste what the browser gets"
[15:33:30] <Kartagis> NoiseEee: if I'm on /project/qwert, I think that parses to /user?destination=/project/qwert
[15:37:50] <NoiseEee> Kartagis: honestly, "view source" and then lets talk.
[15:47:51] <robertmaxrees> you cannot change PHP from within JS - you can update the document.
[15:47:58] <robertmaxrees> php outputs html.
[15:48:04] <robertmaxrees> js changes the html.
[15:54:54] <arc_> man .... dynamically updating php within a rendered html document -_-
[15:56:02] <arc_> Kartagis php executes before the html document exists. any changes to php within the html document after it's rendered will have no effect
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> and any changes to the html will have no effect on the php.
[15:57:29] <Kartagis> $('.webform-client-form-97 #validationErrorMail').html('E-posta adresi uygun değil. Bu e-posta size ait ise <a href="/user?destination="+window.location.href>lütfen giriş yapınız.</a>'); <--- I did something like this
[15:57:43] <robertmaxrees> fyi that selector is really strange.
[15:58:03] <robertmaxrees> $('#validationErrorMail') is all you want.
[15:58:07] <arc_> as robertmaxrees reminded me, if you are selecting an id, there is no reason to be more specific
[15:58:11] <arc_> because ids are unique anyway
[15:58:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:58:27] <Kartagis> our front end dev did that
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> then fix it.
[16:00:01] <Kartagis> any ideas why window.location.href didn't parse?
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> "didn't parse"?
[16:00:39] <Uhkis> because you're missing ' and +'
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> mismatched quotes.
[16:00:42] <Kartagis> I got just /user?destination=
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> 'E-posta adresi uygun değil. Bu e-posta size ait ise <a href="/user?destination="' + window.location.href + '">lütfen giriş yapınız.</a>');
[16:00:57] <Kartagis> riight
[16:02:50] <Kartagis> still no
[16:03:15] <Kartagis> $('.webform-client-form-97 #validationErrorName').html('Kullanıcı adı uygun değil. Bu kullanıcı adı size ait ise <a href="/user?destination="'+window.location.href+'">lütfen giriş yapınız.</a>');
[16:13:35] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, you around?
[16:13:54] <Kartagis> any other ideas?
[16:19:43] <z1haze> cant figure out this chart thing
[16:27:39] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel yo.
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hjkLb6t0/
[16:28:27] <robertmaxrees> just needed to play around with the quotes a big.
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> *bit
[16:41:01] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, you were helping me yesterday though but thenm you had to leave
[16:41:10] <robertmaxrees> sure - ask the channel any questions you might.
[16:41:15] <robertmaxrees> *might have.
[16:41:33] <z1haze> I had created my array of labels that always end on the current day, but i couldnt figure out how to grab data and place it correctly on the chrat
[16:42:03] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> so what's your question?
[16:42:14] <z1haze> like.. if the first statistical entry in the database was from today.. that means all of the days leading up to today would be empty.. and the chart would start all the way on the right side.. how can i make it do that?
[16:42:27] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[16:42:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle and some example data or something?
[16:42:52] <z1haze> no
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> like, you're asking me to do all the heavy lifting - normally you'd have a simple "i'm trying to do x but it's showing in the wrong order" or something like that.
[16:43:02] <Vivekananda> hi
[16:43:07] <z1haze> sorry, not intended
[16:43:28] <robertmaxrees> i know - I'm pointing it out so you're aware of how to get better help :)
[16:44:23] <Vivekananda> not specifically a jquery question but I intend to use it laater. Can someone take a shot at my problem. I am trying to figure out why a string put in an html source is visible on the page but cannot be seen on the rendered page's source. I intend to extract and replace it later with jquery
[16:44:33] <z1haze> I know of a website that does what I want, but other than that I dont know how to give you an example of something i dont know how to do
[16:44:40] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda show us.
[16:44:49] <Vivekananda> http://c923dcae.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/DEVELOPER/AJAX_version/#ajax/dashboard.html
[16:44:52] <robertmaxrees> z1haze have you even tried making a basic chart with whatever lib?
[16:44:59] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda that's way too much.
[16:45:00] <z1haze> yes
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze ok, so start there.
[16:45:10] <robertmaxrees> read docs.
[16:45:16] <robertmaxrees> come up with a question :)
[16:45:25] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, if you run this and look at console I have extracted an id
[16:45:37] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda we need a paired down example, not an entire site.
[16:45:52] <z1haze> .. i have.. but like i just tried explaining i dont know how to bind together the labels at the bottom that are days, with the data points that im plotting on the chart..
[16:46:01] <Vivekananda> hmmm :( okay. I don't have that at the moment
[16:46:06] <z1haze> meaning that tuesday plots will be on the tuesday part of the graph
[16:46:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze so show us what you've tried.
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze the whole point of this channel is we teach you how to fish - experimenting and seeing what does/doesn't work is exactly what i'd be doing,.'
[17:16:05] <s2013> i have an array.. how do i post that array in $.post?
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> $.post('someurl', {myArray: someArray});
[17:18:47] <s2013> oh ok
[17:19:56] <robertmaxrees> use $.ajax() - it makes stuff like this a lot easier.
[17:21:04] <s2013> robertmaxrees i got Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation for the line return $(this).prop('checked') ? $(this).data('user-id') : null; inside a mpa function
[17:21:04] <s2013> map*
[17:21:34] <robertmaxrees> show me the code.
[17:22:29] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/4151931f6987f74c84a0 robertmaxrees
[17:23:50] <z1haze> i cant figure this out :(
[17:23:56] <z1haze> not even enough to make a fiddle
[17:24:05] <s2013> nvm it snot onthat line.. its on
[17:24:05] <s2013> 			value = jQuery.isFunction( value ) ? value() : ( value == null ? "" : value ); from jquery library
[17:24:23] <s2013> im guessing its from the $.post
[17:26:10] <Vivekananda> haven't created a fiddle for this but hopefully somone can answer me without it. I need to change the values which create a sparkline graph before the html is rendered. I dont thing if windows.onload() will help me here as the graph is already loaded
[17:27:01] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, all im getting is a blank graph.. http://puu.sh/lOpZD/c7f8e8b943.png
[17:28:34] <z1haze> what format is this? http://dpaste.com/2B0YNPD this is not json..
[17:28:38] <s2013> any clue robertmaxrees
[17:28:52] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that's json
[17:29:09] <z1haze> its not valid json i just checked it
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> then fix it.
[17:29:24] <z1haze> thats the default codd
[17:29:26] <z1haze> code*
[17:29:30] <z1haze> that is in the example that works
[17:29:37] <z1haze> i try to provide my data in JSON
[17:29:39] <s2013> link to example
[17:29:40] <robertmaxrees> it's missing quotes around the property names for starters.
[17:29:42] <z1haze> and it gives me a empty god damn graph
[17:29:48] <z1haze> no kidding, that code works
[17:29:49] <robertmaxrees> show me a fiddle dude.
[17:30:02] <z1haze> how do i show you a fiddle when im getting data dynmaically from my site
[17:30:12] <robertmaxrees> s2013 you have an extra }) in there
[17:30:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze get a statc copy of the data.
[17:30:37] <drei> <robertmaxrees> can you explain $allSelectedClasses onwards?
[17:30:47] <drei> in the script
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> in what script?
[17:30:58] <s2013> robertmaxrees sorry ignore that.. that was from something else. let me edit the gist
[17:31:16] <s2013> thats just part of the $(document).ready ....
[17:31:27] <z1haze> but you are telling me its json, when its not valid json
[17:31:39] <z1haze> how am i supposed to format my code when json_encoding doesnt output the correct format
[17:31:48] <drei> http://jsfiddle.net/mzvNL/41/
[17:32:03] <robertmaxrees> z1haze fix the format.
[17:32:07] <drei> just wanted to put some notes in there to see what is happening
[17:32:20] <robertmaxrees> drei so what am i explaining?
[17:32:30] <drei> keep track of
[17:32:36] <z1haze> .. its a php function json_encode theres nothing wrong with the function
[17:32:49] <robertmaxrees> so then nothing is broken?
[17:32:55] <z1haze> lol dude
[17:33:10] <z1haze> http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-example-usage <-- thats not json
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> correct- that's a JS object.
[17:33:25] <drei> what is var allSelectedClasses doing?
[17:33:34] <z1haze> so how do i convert json encoded to that
[17:33:42] <jphase> you don't
[17:33:43] <z1haze> how to form JSON that way
[17:33:47] <z1haze> so what am i supposed to do
[17:33:55] <z1haze> there has to be built in functionality to swap back and forth..
[17:34:02] <jphase> use a regular object
[17:34:02] <drei> also what is $activeArticles doing?
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> build it out that way.
[17:34:11] <z1haze> thats what json_encode and json_decode do in php.. i know js has to have something
[17:34:17] <robertmaxrees> drei what do you think they're doing?
[17:34:25] <robertmaxrees> z1haze the php should output in the correct format.
[17:34:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to build out the object correctly.
[17:34:32] <drei> was trying to figure it out
[17:34:35] <z1haze> ffs, it outputs it in JSON
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> but not in the correct format :)
[17:34:48] <jphase> z1haze: you clearly aren't understanding...
[17:34:54] <z1haze> theres only 1 correct format for json, no?
[17:34:55] <jphase> don't use json_encode
[17:34:56] <jphase> as that is json
[17:35:00] <jphase> this doesn't use json
[17:35:04] <jphase> so rather than encoding/decoding
[17:35:06] <jphase> just pass the object
[17:35:08] <jphase> done
[17:35:14] <z1haze> ha, phase..
[17:35:16] <jphase> or.... encode and decode
[17:35:26] <s2013> robertmaxrees any clue :(
[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you're conflating the term format here.
[17:35:29] <jphase> but that would be 2 extra steps
[17:35:29] <s2013> its driving me nuts
[17:35:32] <robertmaxrees> s2013 for what now?
[17:35:44] <s2013> the issue i pasted earlier.. with the $.post
[17:35:48] <robertmaxrees> drei it's the result of a map.
[17:35:52] <robertmaxrees> s2013 show me the code again.
[17:35:55] <z1haze> pass an object from php
[17:35:56] <z1haze> ?
[17:36:06] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/4151931f6987f74c84a0 robertmaxrees
[17:36:19] <jphase> z1haze: just use $.parseJSON - this is clearly going to be easier for you
[17:36:50] <robertmaxrees> s2013 you need to add a .get(); to the end of that map() call.
[17:36:51] <jphase> or JSON.parse() even
[17:38:15] <s2013> hmm im so confused. ive never used get before
[17:38:24] <robertmaxrees> s2013 it convers that to an array.
[17:38:25] <drei> would the script be more simple if we didn't use 'post' class?
[17:38:32] <s2013> but arr is an array
[17:38:38] <s2013> when i console.log(arr) its an array
[17:38:39] <robertmaxrees> s2013 no it's not.
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.
[17:38:48] <s2013> i see
[17:38:55] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use the .get()
[17:38:55] <s2013> so where do i put th .get
[17:39:06] <robertmaxrees> .map(function() {}).get();
[17:39:10] <s2013> ok
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you as much :)
[17:39:35] <drei> was that for me robertmaxrees?
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> drei nope - you need the .get() in your case.
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> not originally.
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> now it is.
[17:40:08] <robertmaxrees> drei allSelectedClasses is all the IDs from all the selected inputs.
[17:40:38] <z1haze> tring to parse just says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o
[17:40:46] <robertmaxrees> z1haze of what data?
[17:41:10] <drei> would the script be more simple if we didn't use 'post' class?
[17:41:20] <robertmaxrees> drei huh?
[17:41:22] <s2013> that halped. thaks robertmaxrees
[17:41:25] <z1haze> of the json_encoded data coming from php
[17:41:38] <robertmaxrees> drei probably?
[17:41:46] <drei> return currentValue !== 'post';
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze okay, then it's not valid JSON.
[17:42:00] <drei> do we even need that?
[17:42:13] <drei> each <li> has a post class
[17:42:23] <z1haze> it says [Object Object]
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> drei you probably do - you realize i barely remember any of this, right?
[17:42:26] <z1haze> or something like that
[17:42:34] <robertmaxrees> z1haze how can we help you right now?
[17:42:58] <z1haze> Sorry..
[17:43:10] <jak2016> drei how re you friend
[17:43:24] <drei> good thanks jak2016
[17:43:39] <robertmaxrees> drei there are tons of ways to do this probably.  changing your markup would be one way.
[17:44:14] <drei> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:44:22] <drei> I wish to be at your level one day
[17:44:27] <robertmaxrees> drei the docs explain all of this for you.
[17:44:40] <drei> what sources do you recommend?
[17:44:46] <robertmaxrees> the jquery api docs for starters.
[17:44:49] <drei> to learn programming in general
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> pick a language and build stuff with it.
[17:45:31] <drei> words of wisdom
[17:45:33] <drei> lol
[17:45:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm serious.  that's really the best way to learn.
[17:46:04] <drei> no, nicely said
[17:46:07] <drei> I like that
[17:46:17] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, i am outputting valid json.. this is the output coming from server side http://dpaste.com/0DRZQNA
[17:46:40] <robertmaxrees> no need to parse that then.
[17:46:45] <z1haze> i just dont understand how im supposed to take it from that format, to the standard format that i need
[17:47:16] <z1haze> again, http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-example-usage is what its expecting.. and i checked with dozens of other chart libs, the formats are basically juste like this on each one..
[17:47:35] <z1haze> i dont understand what step im missing
[17:47:38] <z1haze> you are suggesting i '
[17:48:01] <z1haze> 'fix the output' which would be silly to hardcode the formatting.. im sure this is a very common thing switching from php to javascript, etc
[17:50:45] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating this.
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> your php should build things in the end format you need.
[17:51:02] <robertmaxrees> that's literally how you do that.
[17:51:43] <robertmaxrees> you then have php output in JSON.
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> you're basically confusion the transfer format with the structure of the data.
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> *conflating
[17:57:55] <arc_> php and javascript do different things altogether, so i don't really get what 'switching from php to javascript' would mean
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> it's because he's conflating transmission with structrue.
[17:58:19] <robertmaxrees> *structure
[17:59:53] <z1haze> well im pushing it from php to javascript by encoding it in json
[18:00:34] <robertmaxrees> right, so you need to build up the correct JSON object to begin with.
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> which means building up the correct PHP object.
[18:00:48] <z1haze> it is
[18:00:57] <robertmaxrees> but you said it doesn't work.
[18:01:01] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0DRZQNA is my output
[18:01:12] <z1haze> is what its asking for http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-example-usage
[18:01:27] <z1haze> it has all extra quotation marks etc
[18:01:28] <robertmaxrees> datasets should be an array.
[18:01:51] <z1haze> is it not?
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> nope - it's a plain object.
[18:02:11] <robertmaxrees> with a single "data" property, which is an array.
[18:02:37] <z1haze> not sure why it wouldnt be an array.. i populate it with $data['datasets']['data'][] = $result->players; in a foreach loop
[18:03:12] <z1haze> do i have to instantiate data['datasets'] = [] or something? seems strange
[18:03:13] <robertmaxrees> just telling you what it is.
[18:03:19] <robertmaxrees> wait, yeah.
[18:03:20] <z1haze> no i get it
[18:03:24] <robertmaxrees> if that's how you do that in PHP.
[18:03:36] <z1haze> i just figured it would know its an array..
[18:03:43] <z1haze> maybe its because theres only a single item in it?
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:04:03] <robertmaxrees> how what would know what?
[18:04:47] <z1haze> $data['datasets']['data'][] is clearly an array
[18:04:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP so i'll believe you.
[18:05:00] <z1haze> so i dont see how its not showing datasets as an array
[18:05:19] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing $data['datasets']['data'][] , which i'd guess means data is a named key.
[18:06:02] <z1haze> not my intention. my intention was saying in the data data array which is inside the datasets array
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:06:35] <z1haze> you really dont know php?
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> worked with plenty of other languages.
[18:06:48] <z1haze> thought you guys kinda knew all the languages
[18:06:48] <robertmaxrees> never PHP.
[18:07:00] <robertmaxrees> I know quite a few, but i've never used PHP, so i never learned it.
[18:07:00] <z1haze> cool
[18:07:01] <Robdgreat> z1haze: $data['datasets']['data'][] isn't necessarily an array
[18:07:10] <Robdgreat> $data['datasets']['data'] is
[18:07:25] <Robdgreat> the former depends on what $result->players contains
[18:07:33] <z1haze> but its saying the ['datasets'] isnt even an array
[18:07:34] <robertmaxrees> that's funky.
[18:07:43] <robertmaxrees> because you're giving it a named key.
[18:07:45] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[18:08:00] <z1haze> thats not how you do keys in php though
[18:08:08] <robertmaxrees> JSON.
[18:08:21] <robertmaxrees> JSON represents associative arrays as objects.
[18:08:23] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: if the key exists, it should recognize it as an array
[18:08:25] <z1haze> would be like 'key' => 'value'
[18:09:02] <robertmaxrees> like i said, dunno php - just guessing.
[18:09:23] <z1haze> i gotcha.. well just a example i found: http://www.w3schools.com/php/showphp.asp?filename=demo_array_multi shows the multi dim array using this process
[18:09:25] <Robdgreat> z1haze: so you're using json_decode?
[18:09:43] <z1haze> not in php no..
[18:09:46] <z1haze> im creating the json
[18:09:52] <Robdgreat> from a php array
[18:10:08] <z1haze> gonna upload the code, its a small snippet
[18:10:10] <Robdgreat> my point is you're definitely starting with an array?
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:10:30] <Robdgreat> I missed some of the context and haven't scrolled back very far
[18:10:41] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3FBFC9M
[18:10:46] <robertmaxrees> a true array, not an associative array.
[18:11:23] <z1haze> and $result->players is always there
[18:11:47] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: in PHP arrays are just wonky. There's not a clear distinction, and there's not really any such thing as a "true array"
[18:11:54] <Robdgreat> all arrays in PHP are ordered hashmaps
[18:11:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah i know.
[18:11:57] <robertmaxrees> it kills me.
[18:12:17] <Robdgreat> it's just one of those things you come to terms with or you abandon ship
[18:12:30] <z1haze> i mean there is the traditional syntax to nest arrays with array(array( ... but its all the same thing
[18:12:32] <robertmaxrees> or you just completely avoid it like i have ;)
[18:12:40] <Robdgreat> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:12:42] <Robdgreat> it pays the bills
[18:12:44] <robertmaxrees> because holy lol
[18:12:46] <robertmaxrees> not for me ;)
[18:12:51] <Robdgreat> I meant for me.
[18:12:57] <Robdgreat> well, has paid the bills
[18:13:00] <z1haze> i picked php to learn because it was the easiest to pick up
[18:13:06] <robertmaxrees> nah i know, just saying you can move away from it pretty easily now.
[18:13:20] <Robdgreat> I'm trying to get out of dev entirely
[18:13:25] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:13:31] <Robdgreat> because I hate computers
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:13:35] <z1haze> isnt something like 80% of all websites use php??...
[18:13:41] <Robdgreat> I say that with tongue in cheek, but it's only a mild exaggeration
[18:13:46] <z1haze> so robertmaxrees you are basically leaving yourself out of 80% of the market
[18:13:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:13:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm leaving myself in with large sites that don't use it.
[18:14:03] <robertmaxrees> not all developers work at design firms ;0
[18:14:26] <z1haze> thats fine i was just pointing out a fact that 80% of the internet is php
[18:14:44] <z1haze> according to google anyway
[18:14:46] <robertmaxrees> that number still seems inflated, and popularity != better or more pay or anything else.
[18:15:01] <z1haze> again, not saying its better or worse, thats not about what im saying.
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:15:15] <z1haze> either way, this is jquery channel
[18:15:22] <z1haze> and i appreciate your help
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're trying to say i'm leaving myself out of any market.
[18:15:37] <z1haze> well its just a fact thats all
[18:15:42] <z1haze> not trying to fight
[18:15:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:15:49] <robertmaxrees> it's a loaded statement.
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> if I needed to work with it, I would.  i haven't needed to, so I don't.
[18:16:09] <z1haze> alright
[18:16:25] <robertmaxrees> and I'm well aware this is jquery - I AM a mod here ;)
[18:16:53] <z1haze> do you feel im insulting you or something? im really not trying to be hateful toward you, you've only helped me..
[18:17:19] <Robdgreat> z1haze: insulting - perhaps not. but you're presenting loaded statements as fact
[18:17:20] <z1haze> i think my issue that im stuck on is one of the 'duh' things once i figure it out it will just be like duh
[18:17:20] <robertmaxrees> contextually it came aross kind of condescending.  that's all.  it's not a big deal.
[18:17:35] <Robdgreat> z1haze: it seems as though if you were trying to populate nonexistent keys with data your code would be erroring profusely
[18:17:48] <noahmg123> is there a quick way to delete all an elements chidren up to a certain element?
[18:17:50] <z1haze> well sorry i didnt mean that.. it wasnt even a loaded statement.. i just google searched the info and it gave me a 82% result
[18:18:07] <robertmaxrees> z1haze and that's all that means.  doesn't mean anything else ;)
[18:18:09] <Robdgreat> no, I was referring to your contention that he's missing out on anything
[18:18:10] <Robdgreat> right
[18:18:30] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: honestly, I envy you
[18:18:35] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 could grab any element whose index is lower than a particular one and go from there.
[18:18:45] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat ecommerce - it's where we're getting weird.
[18:19:01] <z1haze> well you only miss out on something that you want/need and he doesnt want/need it lol
[18:19:09] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: well, I'm stuck on the "go from there" part. :P
[18:19:23] <Robdgreat> I'm shooting for the sales side of ecommerce rather than the development, primarily
[18:19:26] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 you can use .filter() to reduce it down .
[18:19:40] <z1haze> so basically im to the point where datasets needs to be an array, and apparently coming from json, its not an array at all
[18:20:05] <Robdgreat> z1haze: how are you getting your json into php?
[18:20:08] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK, I sort of see that. Let me try something.
[18:20:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze *going into JSON, it's not properly formatted.
[18:20:20] <z1haze> i posted all my code from this
[18:20:50] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3FBFC9M
[18:20:58] <Robdgreat> yes, I loaded it
[18:21:05] <z1haze> i just fetch my data, the encode it and return it
[18:21:20] <Robdgreat> so what do you get when you var_dump $data before the start of this snippet?
[18:21:33] <z1haze> it doesnt exist.
[18:21:44] <Robdgreat> I guess you have errors turned off
[18:21:49] <z1haze> no..
[18:21:53] <Robdgreat> because your code should be crapping all the bricks
[18:21:53] <z1haze> i create $data right here..
[18:21:59] <Robdgreat> you don't initialize it
[18:22:03] <z1haze> no
[18:22:04] <z1haze> i dont
[18:22:06] <Robdgreat> put $data = []; at the top
[18:22:12] <z1haze> alright
[18:23:24] <Robdgreat> and $data['labels'] = []; after that, then $data['datasets'] = []; then $data['datasets']['data'] = [];
[18:23:52] <Robdgreat> by default it complains if you push an element onto a nonexistent array key
[18:23:54] <z1haze> i wasnt aware had to do all that
[18:24:47] <z1haze> alright, well all instaniated then
[18:24:54] <Robdgreat> see if it works now
[18:25:03] <z1haze> i have my java object now but nothing showing
[18:25:19] <robertmaxrees> java?  i thought you were in php?
[18:25:27] * Robdgreat snickers
[18:26:04] <Robdgreat> ok, now put var_dump($data);die(); before the json_encode line
[18:26:17] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: sorry to hijack the channel
[18:26:37] <robertmaxrees> it's all good - we've had people complain about this very subject before.
[18:26:56] <Robdgreat> z1haze: var_dump + die is your friend
[18:27:01] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0YM9EH4
[18:27:04] <Robdgreat> lets you see what you're dealing with at any point in the process
[18:27:09] <z1haze> yes Robdgreat im aware of all that
[18:28:07] <Robdgreat> that's before the json_encode line?
[18:28:18] <Robdgreat> if so, you're trying to json_encode a string
[18:28:58] <z1haze> no thats whats being past to my page
[18:29:28] <z1haze> and i use a framework that has a dd function built in, i use it all the time
[18:29:47] <z1haze> the issue is that datasets is not an array im guessing
[18:31:44] <Robdgreat> if you dd $data before the json_encode, it shouldn't output a string
[18:32:06] <Robdgreat> wait
[18:32:13] <Robdgreat> dd $results -_-
[18:33:06] <Robdgreat> hang on
[18:33:14] <Robdgreat> datasets is an array. I'm looking at it in your output
[18:33:33] <Robdgreat> "datasets":{"data":[377,382,373,221,334]}
[18:34:08] <z1haze> well they have datasets: [ { data: [35, 35] ... etc
[18:34:25] <ashgotti> Evening all. I have an odd problem where I"m trying to detect if radio buttons are selected, but the input never gets the 'checked' prop.
[18:34:25] <z1haze> mine is for some reason missing the [ after datasets
[18:34:33] <ashgotti> After I click it, it doesn't get the priority
[18:35:06] <z1haze> Robdgreat, results is just an array of objects
[18:36:01] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti radio buttons?
[18:36:44] <Robdgreat> z1haze: I was thinking you weren't getting datasets at all, which would suggest that the loop populating the datasets wasn't even getting entered into, which would mean that you weren't getting any results back, which turned out to not be the case
[18:36:53] <z1haze> ...
[18:36:59] <z1haze> how would you think that when my json output is populated? lol
[18:37:03] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: input type = radio. Sorry, not buttons, inputs :)
[18:37:22] <Robdgreat> z1haze: what is it you're trying to match against?
[18:37:25] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti sorry, making sure you had the right element type.  have a fiddle?
[18:37:39] <z1haze> ? im building data to display in a chart
[18:37:42] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat z1haze could y'all take it to PM or a php channel at this point?
[18:37:50] <Robdgreat> yeah, was about to suggest that
[18:37:58] <z1haze> sorry
[18:38:03] <robertmaxrees> nah no big.
[18:38:22] <robertmaxrees> ot is fine, but y'all are getting pretty in depth :)
[18:38:41] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ggm8gabv/
[18:39:19] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/6ggmqyg5/ Try clicking "no" and inspect it, it never gets the prop 'checked'
[18:39:38] <robertmaxrees> err. inspecting is the wrong way to do that.
[18:39:57] <ashgotti> your example doesn't either. hmm I want to detect if a radio option has been selected. Documentation says use prop('checked', true) to check.
[18:40:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:40:10] <robertmaxrees> it says use .prop('checked') to verify.
[18:40:15] <robertmaxrees> and oppen your console.
[18:40:23] <robertmaxrees> on my fiddle - works fine :)
[18:41:11] <ashgotti> ah ok, I must have read stackexchange threads wrong
[18:41:19] <ashgotti> Thanks for the millionth time :)
[18:41:36] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked', true) SETS the checked value fwiw.
[18:42:12] <ashgotti> ah so I was reading it wrong
[18:55:08] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I got it working btw, thx.
[18:56:19] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[18:56:54] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees++
[19:13:52] <noahmg123> shoot. Nevermind. But it's probably a typo. Let me check.
[19:14:45] <noahmg123> yep, typo
[19:55:37] <Vivekananda> what is the meaning of a false on ajax{()}.done(function(data){ console.log(data)} on console ?
[19:56:00] <robertmaxrees> ajax{()}.done(function(data){ console.log(data)} isn't anything fwiw.
[19:56:24] <robertmaxrees> i assume you mean $.ajax({}).done(function(data){ console.log(data)}); - and that means you're getting that value back in your ajax call.
[20:06:14] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yes sorry I put the braces wrong. and yes I should get some data back but I am getting a false. I assume it means the data isn't coming back or smething
[20:06:24] <Vivekananda> false in the console I mean
[20:09:13] <robertmaxrees> false is what your server is returning.
[20:11:34] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda does that make sense?
[20:13:15] <Vivekananda> yes I am trying to see why the page that gets the request echoes false
[20:13:20] <Vivekananda> instead of the json data
[20:38:52] <HOWIEDUDE> Hello, anyone know why this is not working?   https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/
[20:40:35] <HOWIEDUDE> has a little nth-of-type
[20:40:37] <HOWIEDUDE> in the fidddle
[20:40:59] <taplar> it has to be img:nth-of.....
[20:41:59] <HOWIEDUDE> i was just thinking that
[20:46:16] <HOWIEDUDE> thanks Taplar
[20:46:24] <taplar> np
[20:51:17] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know how to install an npm package to a specified directory via command line (without package.json)?
[20:51:31] <HOWIEDUDE> Taplar, what would happen if it was wrapped in another div/container    https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/1/
[20:52:34] <taplar> are you wanting to get rid of all of those that have that optional class?
[20:53:01] <HOWIEDUDE> I am trying to just target the 2nd one
[20:53:10] <HOWIEDUDE> it's really a field required * image
[20:53:16] <HOWIEDUDE> but i just set up a simple fiddle demo
[20:53:35] <jeffreylevesque> i was trying to `npm install -g --prefix /where/to/save/myPackage`, based on https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/2309#issuecomment-16307093. But, i don't see in in `/where/to/save/myPackage`
[20:53:37] <HOWIEDUDE> i have no control of the output of the CMS, but I can alter it with jquery
[20:53:40] <taplar> k, well you don't -have- to define the complete structure
[20:54:21] <taplar> 'selector1 selector2'  will find all selector2 contained by selector1 regardless if they are directly or indirectly nested
[20:55:26] <taplar> just target what gets you what your after
[20:56:39] <HOWIEDUDE> i guess i dont' know enough about layered syntax
[20:56:39] <HOWIEDUDE>  $(".bass, .pc_flex_form_required_flag_item img:nth-of-type(0)").removeClass("optionalFieldMarker");
[20:57:18] <taplar> the comma is making it two selectors
[20:58:20] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. does json save its order after creation. Also after an ajax call if I go $.each will I get the values in sequence ?
[20:58:58] <taplar> Vivekananda: are you parsing the json into an object/array?
[20:59:30] <HOWIEDUDE> ok i get it (i think)  https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/2/
[20:59:46] <Vivekananda> I am trying to see which will work better. What I will get is a collection of strings. I think array would suit me better as I need it to be ordered
[21:00:09] <taplar> yes, if order matters you want some form of an array
[21:01:32] <Vivekananda> taplar actually I can use something like this : key: [ value1, v2 , v3 , v4]; key2: [v1, v2...] etc. Wonder how to make a json like this
[21:03:18] <taplar> {"key":"value"} or {"key":["value1","value2"]} or just ["value1","value2"] or some combination thereof
[21:03:46] <taplar> what's your backend?
[21:05:22] <taplar> HOWIEDUDE: you can chain them to save a lookup https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/3/
[21:07:02] <HOWIEDUDE> ok cool
[21:08:01] <durwasa> taplar, I want to build a plugin (chrome or firefox) that automatically opens my IDE from a popular coding website 'Codechef' and then autocomplete the header and the main() part ... I actually don't know from where to begin what will be the flow of programs? With the knowledge of JS and a bit of BASH can I make it or will i need some other language as well? etc ... Can you please help...
[21:08:47] <durwasa> (I am sorry its not a jQuery problem but no one to guide here) taplar
[21:08:53] <taplar> i don't know anything about browser plugin development personally
[21:09:34] <durwasa> taplar, ok ...
[21:09:34] <HOWIEDUDE> what is that way to do a whole bunch at once?  nth-of-type(n+5)
[21:09:49] <taplar> HOWIEDUDE: hmm?
[21:10:24] <HOWIEDUDE> i seen this in the code:  tr:nth-of-type(n+5),
[21:10:32] <HOWIEDUDE> of the cms
[21:12:05] <taplar> ahhh
[21:12:40] <taplar> apparently if you do that the css will logically apply the rule to the children that match it as if you substituted the n for 0,1,2,...
[21:13:11] <HOWIEDUDE> this is weird, it turns on all of them
[21:13:12] <HOWIEDUDE> https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/4/
[21:13:37] <HOWIEDUDE> so i can't really select just like the last line image to be turned on
[21:13:53] <taplar> sure
[21:14:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/5/
[21:15:04] <Vivekananda> taplar, it is key1 key2 each having 4 sets of values to it . I am using keys as element ids and values to fill up each subsequent child of element ( for an html front end of course) .
[21:16:37] <taplar> Vivekananda: if you have keys it would be an object of { key1: "somevalue", key2: "somevalue", ... }  where "somevalue" can be anything; a single value, an array, or even a nested object
[21:16:50] <HOWIEDUDE> ahh ok
[21:16:51] <HOWIEDUDE> https://jsfiddle.net/6wwjkcce/6/
[21:16:56] <HOWIEDUDE> i can target where i want now
[21:17:29] <Vivekananda> taplar here is a line of sample data :     {"sparks": ["$47,171", "1300, 1877, 2500, 2577, 2000, 2100, 3000, 2700, 3631, 2471, 2700, 3631, 2471"]
[21:17:29] <Vivekananda>  }
[21:17:39] <Vivekananda> shit sorry. it went to 3 lines
[21:18:31] <taplar> looks valid syntax.  sparks is an array of two elements there
[21:32:12] <HOWIEDUDE> Is there anyway to find out through a browser DEV tool or debugger, what nth-child or nth-of-type something is, especially the (#)
[21:32:23] <HOWIEDUDE> when your viewing a page
[21:32:30] <HOWIEDUDE> and you do an inspect
[21:33:45] <cannap> with chrome
[21:33:46] <cannap> body > footer > div.container > div > div:nth-child(2) > div.float-left > a:nth-child(5)
[21:33:53] <taplar> you can right click on the element in the inspector and choose to select the unique selector option
[21:33:53] <cannap> copy selector its new
[21:34:39] <cannap> hmm the added new stuff to chrome dev tools
[21:42:05] <HOWIEDUDE> under properties?
[21:43:35] <HOWIEDUDE> ( i am in chrome)
[21:45:14] <taplar> in chrome it appears it is labeled copy css path
[21:45:43] <HOWIEDUDE> i see in fire/fox, i got it as:  div.pc_flex_form:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(3) > div:nth-child(2) > img:nth-child(1)
[21:47:38] <HOWIEDUDE> chrome i get:  div > div:nth-child(3) > div.pc_flex_form_required_flag_item > img
[21:47:42] <HOWIEDUDE> when i do copy selector
[21:48:35] <taplar> what do you mean?
[21:50:06] <HOWIEDUDE> i guess i don't know how your getting to copy/css/path
[21:50:53] <taplar> right click on the page and inspect it, which will bring up the developer tools.  in the elements tab you can right click on an html node and choose to copy the css path in chrome
[21:52:10] <HOWIEDUDE> this is what i see http://postimg.org/image/lb45y0gl9/
[21:52:50] <taplar> huh
[21:52:55] <taplar> it's copy selector for you then
[21:53:27] <HOWIEDUDE> ok
[21:53:32] <HOWIEDUDE> never used that before
[21:53:49] <halletwx> hey guys, if I set a var foo; outside of all functions, and then inside of the first function I set foo, foo sticks and is available to all functions until and unless foo is reset, right? :-/
[21:55:41] <taplar> if foo is set outside of all functions then it is global
[21:55:50] <taplar> *defined
[21:57:20] <halletwx> Hmm, does it have anything (seems to) to do with me setting them inside of document.ready? It seems like if I put document.ready at the very top of my script, do the setting inside there and then try calling it further down, it looks like it's executing the bar before the foo.
[21:58:16] <taplar> i'd need to see the script
[21:58:38] <halletwx> working on a paste heh
[22:00:48] <halletwx> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/pgz4wqam/ I'm 99% certain it's because document.ready is what's setting the variable, and really the only reason I'm doing it this way was because the example said it needed to be in docu.ready. :-/
[22:01:09] <halletwx> But I'd find that odd (I'm just learning all this) that I'd need to wrap my whole script in document.ready.
[22:01:32] <taplar> the console log being outside of the document ready can execute first, yes
[22:01:44] <HOWIEDUDE> Thanks TAPLAR finally working on myh end
[22:01:48] <HOWIEDUDE> learned a lot tonight
[22:01:51] <HOWIEDUDE> peace out
[22:01:52] <taplar> cool
[22:02:09] <halletwx> Well that would mean if I tried calling modelquery after the document.ready it would be undefined right?
[22:02:21] <halletwx> Using console.log or actually trying to use the var.
[22:02:29] <taplar> it could be, yes
[22:03:06] <taplar> if this script is at the top of your page you want everything in the document ready, except for possibly function declarations that will be called later
[22:03:07] <halletwx> Using query strings (unless it was just this specific snippet of code) doesn't require pulling them after the document is ready, does it? o.O
[22:03:44] <halletwx> wow... so if (again unless this querystring code isn't great) I'd have to put my whole script that would use the 'modelquery' var inside of document.ready?
[22:04:01] <halletwx> If modelquery was being defined this way.
[22:04:04] <taplar> do you understand the purpose of document ready?
[22:04:09] <halletwx> I just wanted to pull query parameters lol
[22:04:59] <halletwx> Well, I do and I don't.
[22:05:29] <halletwx> I know the whole "shouldn't be manipulated until the document is ready" aspect, but anything dynamically done with jquery... should be wrapped inside document.ready all the time then?
[22:06:03] <taplar> document ready is intended to delay the execution of the contained logic until the body html has been processed, not necessarily loaded, but processed.  so if your doing any dom lookups in a script before the end of the body you need to put them in a document ready
[22:06:25] <taplar> if your not doing any dom lookups or manipulations, or if your script is at the bottom of the body, you don't need it
[22:06:41] <halletwx> Well it's not literally at the bottom of body, but I see your point.
[22:07:12] <taplar> including the external script at the bottom of the page also suffices for the same thing
[22:10:03] <halletwx> This will be dumb, but could you give me a crude example (as in words, not code) where you would 100% need to be in document.ready?
[22:10:57] <taplar> the script is included, or inlined, in the <head>
[22:11:09] <taplar> and you are doing dom lookup or manipulations
[22:12:41] <taplar> so say i have a script that finds all elements of a class and adds another class to them that wil do something to them like make them bold or something
[22:12:49] <taplar> and i include this in the head
[22:12:59] <taplar> the body has not been processed yet, so they are not yet in the dom to find
[22:13:13] <taplar> so it wouldn't do anything
[22:13:45] <taplar> but putting it in a document ready, it waits until the body is processed and exists in the dom, then executes, at which point my elements exists and it works
[22:15:00] <halletwx> Is that why (standard?) practice is to put almost all JS at the end the body?
[22:16:09] <taplar> yes so you don't have to do that, but also because the document ready has an issue with some version(s) of IE
[22:16:10] <halletwx> Note: I think of jquery as specifically dynamically changing things (i.e. things that will affect code before the script) heh
[22:16:23] <taplar> where it doesn't work right and it falls back on waiting for load
[22:16:45] <taplar> which means your javascript doesn't run until your entire page is loaded (ex.  including images)
[22:16:55] <halletwx> I hear ya.
[22:17:11] <taplar> so to bypass the issue, you put it at the bottom and your good without a ready
[22:35:22] <Vivekananda> hi . I am getting an error for the following code -- http://pastie.org/10619690  can someone tell me what I am doing wrong
[22:37:26] <taplar> try data.sparks in your each
[22:39:16] <Vivekananda> k
[22:40:19] <Vivekananda> Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[22:41:52] <Vivekananda> is the structure of the json ok ? Also if I try console.log(data) right inside the function(data){} I get the json correctly
[22:42:27] <taplar> what do you get if you do console.log(typeof data); ?
[22:43:50] <Vivekananda> ahaa -- string is what I get
[22:44:01] <Vivekananda> that is wrong isn't it ?
[22:44:11] <taplar> you need to parse the json with JSON.parse(data)
[22:45:47] <Vivekananda> the php file that is sending the data has -- echo json_encode($staticData); and $staticData = $staticData = file_get_contents('dashboardData.json');   where dashboardData.json is exactly the variable I pased in pastie above. Why isn't the data getting json encoded then ?
[22:46:56] <taplar> json_encode() is used to change a php (associative) array into json format
[22:47:09] <taplar> if your reading json text from a file there is no reason to do that
[22:47:36] <Vivekananda> http://pastie.org/10619702
[22:48:09] <Vivekananda> this is what I have. do I directly echo it then ? wouldn't it be a string $staticData I mean
[22:48:32] <taplar> you should just be able to echo $staticData
[22:48:44] <taplar> or just echo the file read
[22:48:55] <Vivekananda> but what you said works !
[22:49:21] <Vivekananda> yep that works. interesting . So if I json encode a json object then it becomes a string !!!! ?? that is funny
[22:49:41] <taplar> your json encode an object
[22:49:44] <taplar> not a string
[22:49:53] <taplar> your translating the object structure into json
[22:50:05] <taplar> if you use json_encode()
[22:51:45] <Vivekananda> so you mean when I do json_encode (php associative array) then the ass array is also an object  ? and on doing the encode it still remains an object but just becomes a json object ?
[22:52:43] <taplar> no, i'm saying don't think about it as a 'json object'
[22:52:46] <taplar> it's just an object
[22:53:00] <taplar> json_encode() translates it into a string, in json format
[22:58:34] <jim_j> hi
[22:58:59] <jim_j> what's a better way than an 'onclick' event on a button?
[23:01:23] <taplar> jim_j: bind your event handler with on()
[23:01:36] <taplar> $(selector).on(event, handler);
[23:01:54] <jim_j> taplar, thanks!
[23:37:15] <Vivekananda> Trying to get to only the first span here. https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/f54jdthj/  but getting all the results. where do I see the documents for jquery to get to children
[23:54:21] <Vivekananda> anyone around
[23:54:30] <Vivekananda> can someone tell me what is wrong with this == https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/f54jdthj/2/
