[05:47:38] <sarath_> haii..am new to jquery
[05:49:44] <sarath_> i have jquery datepicker on my php form , its working pretty much good in all way. but when ajax response displays with date picker textbox doesn't shows any datepicker calender in it.please help
[05:54:52] <Cork> sarath_: if you add new elements to the page you will have to run datepicker on them to enable the plugin
[05:55:14] <Cork> from your explanation it sounds like that is what you're doing
[06:01:21] <sarath_> js files for datepicker which i included works when the form first loaded, but its not actually takes those included files when ajax response in the same page !!!
[06:07:02] <Cork> sarath_: ya, cause the file executes on page load (most likely ready), but those aren't executed when you add forms/fields through ajax
[06:07:22] <Cork> so you need to run the plugin calls for the newly added fields
[06:07:31] <Cork> (on ajax calls)
[06:17:17] <sarath_> so how to run plugin files on ajax calls?
[06:19:00] <sarath_> thank you cork
[06:19:12] <sarath_> thank you @cork
[07:05:38] <echoSMILE> Hi. In this code https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/3/ how can I iterate 'room' inside the iteration of 'htl' and show only the 'tr.room' that status = 'ok' ?
[07:24:33] <echoSMILE> basically,   is running an each() inside of an each() but all tries I cannot do what I want
[07:26:53] <Cork> echoSMILE: so you want to show the htl only if it contains a status with value ok?
[07:27:13] <Cork> all of them do so not sure what you expect to happen here
[07:27:43] <echoSMILE> Cork: i want to show htl and room's if status ok
[07:27:55] <Cork> echoSMILE: so all of them?
[07:28:00] <echoSMILE> yes
[07:28:08] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/4/
[07:28:17] <Cork> opps wrong
[07:28:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/5/
[07:29:01] <Cork> forgot the return https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/6/
[07:30:40] <echoSMILE> Cork: that don't work
[07:30:49] <Cork> it does exactly what you asked for here >_>
[07:31:00] <Cork> it hides all the htl, then shows them if there is an ok inside them
[07:31:13] <Cork> meaning everything is visible
[07:31:16] <echoSMILE> but the output it returned both ok's and nok's
[07:31:32] <Cork> ya, that is what you asked for
[07:31:57] <echoSMILE> only show if status is ok
[07:32:39] <echoSMILE> room status = nok then hide
[07:32:47] <Cork> umm...
[07:32:50] <Cork> your html is broken
[07:32:56] <Cork> you can't have input as children to tr
[07:33:09] <echoSMILE> oh yeah you are right
[07:33:16] <echoSMILE> need the tds
[07:34:07] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/7/
[07:37:55] <echoSMILE> Cork: you did it using only one line. but, can you use one each() to iterate 'htl's ? that's because I do other stuff in my production code for 'htl'
[07:41:35] <user696969> hi
[07:42:51] <user696969> what select plugin, with ajax data load capability, you would recommend?
[07:43:48] <Cork> echoSMILE: sure you just have to do $(this).find('.status') and the rest after that
[07:44:09] <Cork> (the filter i did up there)
[07:44:40] <Cork> user696969: i think jquery ui has one
[07:44:53] <Cork> i normally just use autocomplete when i need things like that
[07:50:11] <echoSMILE> Cork: I can't do similar to this? https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/8/
[07:50:54] <user696969> Cork: autocomplete on a select?
[08:13:25] <Cork> user696969: no i use jquery ui autocomplete
[08:14:00] <Cork> echoSMILE: that is similar to what i meant, but you use named variables instead of this
[08:14:49] <echoSMILE> this worked https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/9/
[08:15:23] <echoSMILE> i think the first times it didn't because of missing <td>
[08:15:26] <echoSMILE> tks
[08:15:44] <Cork> echoSMILE: https://jsfiddle.net/v4cLek73/10/
[08:15:49] <Cork> no need for the if case
[08:17:53] <echoSMILE> cool. tks

[09:43:30] <hoder> if I'm using 'msg' to populate a variable, how can I target specific variables without overwriting?
[09:52:07] <Cork> hoder: what do you mean msg?
[09:52:39] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/
[09:52:53] <hoder> msg is the value of my textarea
[09:55:26] <Cork> hoder: i fail at following what you're trying to do here
[09:55:41] <Cork> hte username is called on page load, you can't have it differ
[09:55:43] <Cork> the*
[09:56:06] <hoder> I know that, I'm saying if I later want to ask the user for a different value that they have to type it
[09:56:09] <Cork> (meaning more context of what it is you're trying to do is needed)
[09:56:55] <Cork> is it prevState you're having problems with?
[09:57:00] <Cork> cause msg isn't stored
[09:57:10] <hoder> anytime someone enters something into the input, it replaces user input, take a look at this working example https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/awOyGE
[09:57:33] <hoder> if yougo down the list, type your name > my certifications > my practicum
[09:57:44] <hoder> then type again and it assumes it's asking for username again
[10:39:29] <danny920825> Hello. Please i need a little help with jquery. Somebody here speak spanish? my english is very slow.
[10:48:13] * danny920825 Please somebody here can help me?
[10:48:31] <taplar> Ask your question then?
[10:57:20] <AdamPDotty> io no hablo espanol
[11:03:50] <danny920825> i need download jquery's documentation to used offline. I don't have internet ( im from cuba) and don't know where i can download.
[11:08:01] <taplar> i'm not sure that there is a readily available offline source
[11:08:12] <taplar> you might have to grab the git repo for the api site
[11:08:45] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[11:09:42] <AdamPDotty> maybe http://jqapi.com/jqapi.zip but could be a virus for all I know
[11:24:44] <danny920825> taplar, AdamPDotty thnaks. I'll try and i promise comeback to say if work or not.
[11:25:55] <AdamPDotty> errrm buena suerte
[11:31:16] <hoder> how can I stop my variable from being rewritten if I have to reuse my textarea function?
[11:32:00] <taplar> share your code?
[11:32:14] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/6/
[11:32:31] <hoder> The part I'm having trouble with is I ask the user for a name, then later on need to get their email
[11:32:51] <hoder> but if I try to set it on my `msg` variable, it resets my username
[11:36:56] <taplar> the part that you set the email on 'msg'?
[11:41:33] <hoder> so, I've been trying to set it on email on line 97, where I .show() the input again, but can't seem to get it to register as something else other than username
[11:42:10] <taplar> all line 97 is doing is showing the message field
[11:42:53] <hoder> (It's not in there atm, but this is what it looked like) https://bpaste.net/show/ea701b42cf7d
[11:43:39] <taplar> ok, so that code is setting msg to a locally scoped email variable
[11:43:51] <taplar> on click that is
[11:44:28] <taplar> i don't see msg scoped in that snipplet so it is a more global variable
[11:45:42] <taplar> my suggestion would be to not use a global msg varialbe
[11:45:52] <hoder> So if I drop the `var` would that fit globally? I need to store certain user data globally so I can set it in localstorage later on
[11:45:59] <taplar> instead, pass the value in to that callback method and use that instead
[11:46:34] <hoder> callback of msg?
[11:46:37] <taplar> your send_msg function is calling callback();  you can pass in the msg resulting from that instance of the call into that
[11:47:01] <taplar> so it is not global and will not be possible for it to be changed by other things unexpectedly
[11:47:24] <hoder> function send_msg(msg, username)? like that?
[11:48:10] <danny920825> you can't use another variable?
[11:48:31] <taplar> whatever value the callback needs to do its work, you'd pass that in
[11:50:00] <hoder> Im not sure I'm following :/    so send_msg is used to push the robot's text into the chat box, i need to be able to store certain user variables to access later
[11:53:25] <taplar> where are you getting the email?
[11:53:32] <taplar> *from the user
[11:54:07] <hoder> I'm trying to prompt it in the same way I prompt for their name
[11:55:46] <taplar> so you are trying to perform all your operations based off of the clicking of sendMsg?
[11:56:05] <hoder> so there will be two types of input
[11:56:29] <hoder> clicking sendMsg (enter) when typing data, then clicking the option buttons when they are avaible
[11:56:46] <hoder> but I am trying to recycle my get_username function to allow me to get email later on
[11:57:06] <taplar> you are wanting to use get_username to get the name and the email?
[11:58:36] <hoder> it doesn't have tp be the exact function, but I'm trying to do it in the same way
[11:59:02] <taplar> ok, so back to my previous question.  are you trying to perform all your logic through the clicking of sendMsg?
[11:59:49] <taplar> because https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/6/  you have line 122 logic and https://bpaste.net/show/ea701b42cf7d you have line 4 logic
[12:00:15] <hoder> only the ones that set a variable
[12:00:23] <taplar> but which variable?
[12:00:28] <taplar> the first one goes to username
[12:00:31] <taplar> the second to email
[12:00:35] <hoder> username & email
[12:00:36] <taplar> both based on the same action
[12:00:45] <taplar> how are you differentiating?
[12:01:00] <taplar> neither of those two currently are differentiating if the click should do the username or the email
[12:01:01] <hoder> I was trying to do it based on the function
[12:01:16] <hoder> er, the conditional it was in
[12:01:29] <taplar> where?
[12:02:07] <hoder> 				if (b_val == 'practicum') {
[12:02:53] <taplar> line # ?
[12:03:03] <hoder> 94
[12:03:12] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/7/
[12:04:01] <taplar> ok, how does that negate the username click logic?
[12:04:37] <hoder> I though by doing this 'msg' would be scoped to only be referred to the one in this conditional
[12:04:43] <taplar> you understand that performing a binding on an element does not unbind previous bindings for the same event on that same element, yes?
[12:05:15] <hoder> I think so, by binding you're referring to me setting sendMsg to update my username, correct?
[12:05:33] <taplar> $('#sendMsg').on('click', ...);
[12:05:36] <taplar> ^ binding
[12:05:46] <taplar> you are binding the username logic
[12:05:53] <taplar> and later you are, conditionally, binding the email logic
[12:05:59] <taplar> the username logic is not being unbound
[12:06:06] <taplar> it will happen any time the click happens on that element
[12:06:18] <hoder> Ok I see that
[12:06:55] <taplar> so really what you should look into is doing a single binding for that guy, and check inside that if you should do the username or the email logic
[12:07:18] <taplar> or whatever other logic you'll eventually have
[12:07:36] <hoder> So would I keep that binding on the outside?
[12:07:48] <hoder> or do I have to move it?
[12:07:51] <taplar> you'd have it outside any other logic that repeats
[12:07:55] <taplar> you only want to bind once
[12:08:26] <taplar> otherwise you run into these issues where things are changing things that you don't expect, :)
[12:08:52] <hoder> How do I make sure it only gets bound once though? or How can I do a conditional for that
[12:09:06] <hoder> do I have to check the binding with an if before I use it?
[12:09:35] <taplar> no, you just do it outside of any logic that repeats.  at a point that you know sendMsg exists
[12:09:45] <taplar> then your conditionals will be in the event handler for that guy
[12:10:09] <taplar> $(elementSelector).on(event, eventHandler)
[12:10:47] <taplar> i'll throw up a over simplified example
[12:10:52] <hoder> So i'd want: $('#sendMsg').on(click, eventHandler) ?
[12:11:00] <hoder> Thank you, I'd appreciate that!
[12:14:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ovzpafdt/
[12:15:30] <taplar> very simple example, but shows what i'm talking about with conditionals in the handler
[12:16:19] <hoder> So i would be checking if a user name exists, if it does then the next one would be updating email?
[12:16:47] <taplar> you have some sort of conditionals that your application relies on to know if it should be setting the username or the email.  those are your conditionals
[12:17:05] <hoder> let me try updating, 1 sec
[12:17:42] <taplar> for instance you mentioned a b_val as part of something leading up to setting the email
[12:17:52] <taplar> that may be a part of the conditional to determine if you are setting the email
[12:18:01] <taplar> it's all about the logic that your application demands
[12:18:34] <hoder> b_val is button value, it;s not required for the email, but more or less required to get to the next question
[12:19:57] <hoder> Is something like this on the right track? https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/8/   setting them to 'msg' in the on click?
[12:20:38] <taplar> no, forget msg
[12:20:53] <taplar> where are the users inputting their username/email?  the input right?
[12:20:57] <hoder> so I'm no longer setting off msg?
[12:21:06] <hoder> the textarea, but msg handles them also clicking it
[12:21:48] <taplar> ?
[12:22:05] <hoder> so they type in the text area, then hit enter to click sendMsg
[12:22:46] <taplar> ok, so in both cases the value that you want is in the textarea
[12:23:04] <hoder> so I want textarea.val()?
[12:23:08] <taplar> whither you are going into that click logic because they clicked the button or you logically clicked it
[12:23:23] <taplar> yes, provided textarea is a jquery object
[12:23:38] <hoder> well I'd get the name of it but yea, 1 sec
[12:24:19] <taplar> i only said that for clarification, just so you don't try to do val() off of a basic Element object, ;)
[12:24:30] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/9/  updated
[12:24:48] <hoder> I gotcha, I have a basic understanding, just scoping and stuff like that is hard :(
[12:25:02] <taplar> it's all about functions
[12:25:20] <taplar> if you use var, it only exists in the function that you defined it in, and child functions
[12:25:29] <taplar> if you don't do var, it's global
[12:25:37] <taplar> and usually bad
[12:25:44] <taplar> err, not preferred, :)
[12:26:19] <taplar> but that looks fine for getting the value
[12:26:39] <hoder> So I have that working and console.logged and still seem to be changing username
[12:26:46] <hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/10/
[12:26:52] <taplar> if your logic later runs into issues with it setting the wrong field, you'll just need to modify the conditionals
[12:28:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/x7e0dbzc/11/  you left in the other binding
[12:29:15] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out though.  got some work outing thing.  others should be able to help more.  best of luck man, :)
[12:29:30] <hoder> Real quick before you go?
[12:29:57] <taplar> really quick
[12:30:00] <hoder> it only seems to add onto the email if I submit twice? It seems to always want to update username first
[12:30:08] <hoder> is that because I'm setting the conditional wrong?
[12:30:32] <taplar> your conditional, as is, will only set the username if it is less than 3, right?
[12:31:31] <taplar> so figure out what the actual conditional(s) are for when you should set the username vs the email.  they may not be based only of if they are set or not.
[12:31:45] <taplar> later mate

[18:37:05] <tom_m2003> Hi - when I click on a checkbox, I want a block of javascript to be invoked, and when it is clicked again the javascript is unenvoked.  I am guessing that I can use the click function and toggle?  Or is toggle just for elements on a page?
[18:42:50] <robertmaxrees> "un[i]nvoked" is odd.
[18:42:53] <robertmaxrees> what would this js do?
[18:43:27] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, you want the change event, not the click event :)
[18:52:18] <tom_m2003> I'll try 'change'
[18:53:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:53:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the code you're trying to invoke and uninvoke?
[18:56:00] <tom_m2003> it's a plugin on Wordpress.  The idea is that it won't let me create a post unless there is an image.  It works fine, but I need to restrict it to just posts within a certain category (and not all posts).  So, I want to invoke the code only when the checkbox for that category is checked.
[18:56:58] <tom_m2003> and ignore/uninvoke if the user unchecks the checkbox
[18:58:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, so not "uninvoke", just let it pass validation.
[18:59:57] <tom_m2003> yes, although there is other code e.g. a message that displays on the screen saying that the user must add a featured image.  This only needs to be displayed if the checkbox is checked
[19:01:30] <tom_m2003> so I thought it might be easier to wrap the whole block of code in something like: http://jsfiddle.net/3zs3pzL7/   but instead of just affecting the elements on the page, the whole block is affected
[19:02:34] <tom_m2003> the jsfiddle link is just to give a basic idea of toggling a block of code on and off
