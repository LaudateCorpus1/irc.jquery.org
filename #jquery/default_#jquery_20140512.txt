[00:20:49] <carpediembaby> Hello, I have run into a problem (because of my lack of knowledge) for which i would like to ask for some help. I am trying to validate inputs of a form, but I don't seem to get the updated values in inputs. I keep on getting old values. Here is a paste: http://pastebin.com/5z01vBqy
[00:22:29] <carpediembaby> Also, when i try to get the inputs of the form (id='offer') via selector (like so: $("#offer :input:visible");), I don't see the values which have been updated in the form.
[00:24:30] <Cork> carlosgoce: .val and user inputs doesn't change the value attribute on the dom element
[00:24:35] <Cork> *carpediembaby:
[00:24:45] <Cork> carpediembaby: and that is what you see if you do $('#id')
[00:25:01] <Cork> carpediembaby: val() changes the property value of the input field
[00:25:06] <carpediembaby> Cork: yes
[00:35:56] <xec> carpediembaby: if you want to read the current value, do $('#Title').val()
[00:54:24] <sl33k_> Could anyone tell me what this line means for a canvas? var x = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft;
[00:56:09] <Cork> sl33k_: it doesn't have anything to do with canvas
[00:56:29] <Cork> it takes the cursors position in relation to the page minus the offsetLeft of the element your on
[00:56:35] <Cork> to get a position in relation to the element
[01:17:54] <sl33k_> thanks Cork
[01:18:10] <Cork> yw
[01:18:47] <Cork> sl33k_: warning though, firefox calculates that differently then chrome if i remember correctly
[01:44:42] <marsjaninzmarsa> hi all
[01:45:39] <marsjaninzmarsa> I wanna to define hook in jQuery
[01:45:51] <cableguy_> hi newbie here. can someone wrap me this code in jquery document.getElementsByClassName("youtube-play-ico").style.pointerEvents = "none";
[01:46:54] <marsjaninzmarsa> cableguy_: $('.youtube-play-ico').css('pointer-events', 'none');
[01:47:16] <marsjaninzmarsa> but getting back to my question:
[01:48:13] <marsjaninzmarsa> how can I do something like: addHook('post-init', function() { doSomething(); });
[01:48:25] <marsjaninzmarsa> doHook('post-init');
[01:49:20] <Tomashe> Hey guys, was wondering how can i put here OR statement
[01:49:27] <Tomashe> children("div:not(#test)").remove();
[01:49:35] <Tomashe> i want to add #test OR #test2
[01:50:12] <marsjaninzmarsa> Tomashe: children("div:not(#test), div:not(#test2)")
[01:50:24] <marsjaninzmarsa> Tomashe: just like in CSS.
[01:50:26] <Tomashe> this isnt working , its removing
[01:50:43] <seutje> $('#test, #test2').eq(0)?
[01:51:07] <Tomashe> but i want to remove everything but those
[01:51:19] <seutje> that would return #test if it exists, and #test2 if #test didn't exist
[01:51:19] <Dragooon> You need and
[01:51:32] <Dragooon> As in that's an AND logic not OR
[01:51:38] <Dragooon> OR in that case would remove everything
[01:51:48] <seutje> u wanna remove everything but #test or #test2?
[01:51:53] <marsjaninzmarsa> Dragooon have right, Tomashe.
[01:51:53] <Tomashe> yes
[01:51:59] <Dragooon> div:not(#test):not(#test2)
[01:52:00] <Dragooon> I think
[01:52:24] <Tomashe> hmm
[01:52:26] <seutje> not sure if u can make that work in a single statement whilst keeping ur sanity
[01:52:38] <marsjaninzmarsa> or not...
[01:52:46] <marsjaninzmarsa> give me a sec...
[01:52:50] <xec> Tomashe: i would rephrase the question if i was you, seems like i'm not the only one confused about what you want
[01:53:10] <seutje> $('*').not($('#test, #test2').eq(0)).remove()
[01:53:18] <Tomashe> div:not(#test):not(#test2) < THIS WORKS LIKE CHARME
[01:53:19] <Tomashe> :)
[01:53:24] <Tomashe> thanks guys
[01:53:26] <xec> lol
[01:53:33] <seutje> oh it had to be a div?
[01:53:39] <marsjaninzmarsa> Tomashe: :)
[01:53:41] <Tomashe> :)
[01:53:43] <Tomashe> all good now
[01:54:13] <Dragooon> Welcome
[01:54:19] <seutje> my prayers go to whoever maintains this in a couple months
[01:54:36] <marsjaninzmarsa> anyone have an idea how to do hooks in jQuery/JS?
[01:54:46] <Dragooon> marsjaninzmarsa: What kind of hooks?
[01:55:05] <marsjaninzmarsa> <marsjaninzmarsa> how can I do something like: addHook('post-init', function() { doSomething(); });
[01:55:05] <marsjaninzmarsa> <marsjaninzmarsa> doHook('post-init');
[01:55:08] <marsjaninzmarsa> Dragooon:
[01:55:24] <xec> marsjaninzmarsa: what exactly are you trying to achieve
[01:55:40] <Dragooon> Yeah, why do you need that in jQuery?
[01:55:47] <Dragooon> Events should suffice
[01:56:01] <marsjaninzmarsa> i need to define my own event.
[01:56:45] <xec> okay? tried to google "jquery custom event"?
[01:57:20] <marsjaninzmarsa> xec: hmm, nope. only "jQuery custom hook", but nothing helpful :D
[01:57:58] <seutje> marsjaninzmarsa: jQuery already allows you to .trigger any event on any object
[01:58:01] <marsjaninzmarsa> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[01:58:11] <marsjaninzmarsa> i'v just google that
[01:58:14] <marsjaninzmarsa> thanks. :D
[01:59:24] <marsjaninzmarsa> xec, seutje: you guyz are the best. :D
[01:59:51] <seutje> I dunno, I'm no jeresig
[02:00:45] <marsjaninzmarsa> :)
[02:10:41] <sl33k_>  I want to delete the circle drawn on double click. How do I go about it? http://jsfiddle.net/kneDX/1983/
[02:13:23] <Cork> sl33k_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#clearRect%28%29
[02:13:50] <Cork> or you can clear the canvas if that is enough
[02:17:31] <sl33k_> Cork: clearRect is what I need. But I am stuck how do I detect the correct size and location of previously drawn circle. Any thoughts?
[02:18:22] <Cork> sl33k_: radius of the circle should give you the top left and bottom right corner
[02:18:34] <Cork> it's just math :)
[02:23:20] <xec> but if you had two circles overlapping you'd be screwed
[02:23:44] <Cork> ya
[02:24:07] <Cork> best option there is to store an array of the circles you've created
[02:24:13] <Cork> remove the one you want gone
[02:24:16] <Cork> clean the canvas
[02:24:17] <xec> redraw
[02:24:20] <Cork> and draw the rest a new
[02:25:35] <xec> not sure how easy it is to find the one you click on though
[02:25:49] <xec> i bet svg would be awesome for that, just attach an event to the element :P
[02:27:46] <Cork> ya
[02:41:26] <abishek> what is the difference between $(element).position().left and $(element).offset().left ?
[02:42:36] <Cork> abishek: one is relative to the page and one to the overflow parent
[02:43:14] <Cork> heh ya
[02:43:21] <Cork> and it is the reverse to what you would think
[02:43:25] <tank853> if i have 2 global variables with the same value, what's the right way to define it?   fruit1, fruit2 = banana  or fruit1 = fruit 2 = banana
[02:43:36] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/position/ gives the position relative to the offsetParent
[02:43:49] <Cork> and http://api.jquery.com/offset/ gives the position relative to the page
[02:44:04] <abishek> Cork, thnx
[02:44:08] <Cork> and http://api.jquery.com/offsetParent/ is what .position() referes to...
[02:44:15] <abishek> ok
[02:44:23] <Cork> lovely and logical...
[02:44:25] <Cork> NOT >_<
[02:46:50] <systemfault> Resig was surely smoking some cool stuff back then..
[02:47:56] <ecthiender> what makes you say so systemfault ?
[02:48:47] <systemfault> ecthiender: When he decided that .position would give the offset… and .offset would give the position.
[02:49:03] <ecthiender> ah right. just followed the above conversation :P
[02:49:04] <systemfault> Also… when he decided to call a “filter” function…. .grep
[02:49:11] <ecthiender> ha ha. yeah.
[02:49:24] <ecthiender> naming things are the number one problem in computer science :)
[02:49:39] <systemfault> Yeah… that and caching
[02:49:47] <ecthiender> rather cache invalidation.
[02:50:21] <ecthiender> and you might think these are two problems. but then again we have off-by-one errors too! ;)
[02:50:21] <systemfault> Right… that Phil <something> was right.
[02:50:55] <systemfault> Karlton… Phil Karlton
[02:51:04] <systemfault> http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html
[02:51:10] <systemfault> There is also a variation on this that says there are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.
[02:52:39] <systemfault> Off by one errors are common only in languages without a foreach or the classic functional “bread and butter” functions(filter/map/reduce)
[02:53:04] <tank853> if i have 2 global variables with the same value, what's the right way to define it?   fruit1, fruit2 = banana  or fruit1 = fruit 2 = banana
[02:53:45] <systemfault> tank853: That’s a bit like asking “What’s the best way to burn my house?” :P
[02:54:11] <Cork> tank853: var fruit1, fruit2 = banana;
[02:54:13] <Cork> opps
[02:54:19] <Cork> tank853: var fruit1, fruit2 = fruit1 = banana;
[02:54:24] <systemfault> window.lol = window.rofl = 10; // If you REALLY want globals.
[02:54:25] <tank853> systemfault: yikes are both ways that bad?
[02:54:33] <Cork> true
[02:54:56] <Cork> tank853: implicit globals is BAD ya
[02:55:17] <Cork> "use strict"; FTW!
[02:55:19] <systemfault> tank853: Just saying that because you should strive to avoid globals as much as possible.
[02:55:51] <Cork> tank853: you can create a scope if two functions need to share the data
[02:56:10] <Cork> that way you don't have to pollute global
[02:56:43] <tank853> Ah, yeah I was using globals because I was running counters for two functions and they were both starting at 0, so wanted to see if there  was a way to share that value for both before the value got replaced within the function
[02:56:52] <Cork> (function() { var fruit1, fruit2 = fruit1 = banana; function func1() {}; function func2() {} })();
[02:57:13] <Cork> or to expose them
[02:57:25] <Cork> (function() { var fruit1, fruit2 = fruit1 = banana; window.func1 = function func1() {}; window.func2 = function func2() {} })();
[02:58:10] <tank853> hm interesting
[02:59:01] <tank853> yeah cool, lots to learn. thanks Cork & systemfault
[04:03:18] <narcarsiss> Is ther a way to draw tooltips to html5 Canvas?
[04:05:44] <repos> is it hard to create a jquery image uploader?
[04:06:57] <brunoais> repos, that depends on the "extras" you want
[04:07:22] <narcarsiss> repos: http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[04:07:56] <Cork> narcarsiss: you can do what ever you like in a canvas
[04:08:08] <Cork> narcarsiss: you need to draw the "bubble" you want and render the text on it
[04:08:30] <narcarsiss> well it was working before i changed my >a tag> to a canvas now it's broke :?
[04:09:44] <narcarsiss> been fiddling with this: $(canvas).bt($Username);
[04:09:53] <Cork> narcarsiss: or do you mean you want a title="" on the entire canvas?
[04:10:22] <Cork> narcarsiss: canvas doesn't have dom elements so you can't make dom render things in it
[04:10:23] <narcarsiss> Yes at php duplicated the canvas amount of time a player is detected
[04:10:38] <narcarsiss> oh that makes sense
[04:10:58] <Cork> canvas is basically a "live" images where content is drawn in it
[04:11:11] <Cork> so there is only pixels
[04:11:32] <narcarsiss> I gathered that. but as how to work around it im stumped
[04:11:51] <Cork> narcarsiss: you would have to in js track the mouse positoon
[04:12:24] <Cork> *position
[04:12:36] <narcarsiss> oh but that's nasty :?
[04:12:52] <Cork> narcarsiss: well how is the browser to magically know what you want? :)
[04:13:39] <rindolf> Hi all.
[04:13:43] <narcarsiss> Magic. but srsly this is what im trying to tool tip tp <canvas class='model' id='<?php echo $value?>_model'></canvas>
[04:14:11] <narcarsiss> I was hoping you coult help Cork
[04:14:20] <narcarsiss> Being a wizz n all
[04:15:29] <Cork> narcarsiss: you could try doing something like  <canvas title="a tooltip for the canvas" class='model' id='<?php echo $value?>_model'></canvas>
[04:15:37] <Cork> narcarsiss: but it will be for the entire image
[04:15:44] <Cork> it won't know anything about what is in it
[04:15:54] <narcarsiss> thats fine the images is only 40x60
[04:16:00] <narcarsiss> Google mentioned this: BeautyTips
[04:16:05] <narcarsiss> tooltips for canvas
[04:16:09] <Cork> no
[04:16:37] <Cork> beautytip uses svg withfallback on explorerCanvas (vml) for old ie browsers
[04:16:48] <Cork> unless someone has stolen the name that is
[04:17:13] <narcarsiss> oh ok.
[04:25:11] <joemo> hi
[04:25:39] <joemo> is there a way to display all defined variables in a function scope?
[04:27:03] <Cork> joemo: some debuggers support listing it
[04:27:10] <Cork> joemo: but no it isn't something you can do in code
[04:28:49] <joemo> thanks Cork
[04:29:14] <Cork> np
[04:44:48] <bberry> http://jsfiddle.net/97XuQ/
[04:44:54] <bberry> How do i change JUST the text node
[04:44:56] <bberry> ?
[04:53:53] <Cork> bberry: add an extra span to hold the text
[04:54:14] <bberry> blegh i was worried about that. okie doke XD
[04:54:21] <Cork> bberry: alternatively you need to go deep level and loop over the text nodes and do it that way
[04:54:28] <Cork> but i don't recommend it
[04:54:33] <bberry> yeah. ill just add a span
[04:59:00] <bberry> Thanks Cork :D
[05:07:26] <dwarder> what do you use for automated js testing?
[05:08:30] <systemfault> Me… karma + mocha + chai + sinon
[05:08:51] <bberry> customers
[05:09:02] <dwarder> systemfault: wow, all this i need to learn how to use?
[05:09:14] <dwarder> bberry: what do you mean?
[05:09:19] <bberry> lol i was kidding
[05:09:38] <bberry> i meant customers using my applicated and reporting bugs to me
[05:09:42] <bberry> application*
[05:10:31] <systemfault> dwarder: karma is the test runner… Mocha is the test framework.. chai is the assertion library and sinon.js is a mock/spy lib.
[05:10:49] <systemfault> dwarder: When used together, you have a complete testing environment
[05:11:19] <rindolf> dwarder: I use QUnit for that.
[05:16:03] <dwarder> systemfault: thank you
[05:16:07] <dwarder> rindolf: thank you
[05:17:24] <dwarder> systemfault: does this include visual clicking and dragging?
[05:17:49] <rindolf> dwarder: you're welcome .
[05:18:00] <dwarder> systemfault: or is it like: you have this function and you must get this value
[05:18:04] <systemfault> dwarder: No, if you want something like that, you’ll want something like selenium and QA people.
[05:20:49] <frank_o> Hi, for this rectangle which expands on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/4/embedded/result/ -- how does one prevent the parallaxed area from "shooting out of view" once the rectangle is hovered?
[05:20:53] <frank_o> I'm using https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax with http://packery.metafizzy.co/.
[05:51:11] <bberry> how can i prove that doing $("input[type='button']").on("click") creates a different event handler for each item selected?
[05:51:18] <bberry> ideally using jsfiddle
[05:53:04] <bberry> .on('click', function...) rather
[05:55:27] <Cork> bberry: you could run it
[05:55:33] <Cork> and then add one additional button
[05:55:39] <Cork> the new button won't have an event listener
[05:59:06] <bberry> hmm. i meant something more like, if i had 10 buttons, i would have 10 separate handlers instead of 1 handler. like, itd be cool to have a counter or something that increments when each event handler is assigned to its element
[05:59:41] <Cork> bberry: you can't really do that
[05:59:52] <Cork> bberry: you create 10 different event handler entries
[05:59:56] <Cork> but all of them call the same function
[06:00:02] <Cork> you don't get 10 functions
[06:00:30] <bberry> yeah. meh.
[06:02:24] <Cork> bberry: possibly http://jsfiddle.net/ybHCa/1/
[06:02:44] <Cork> vs http://jsfiddle.net/ybHCa/2/
[06:03:08] <bberry> Cork: oh nice, yeah that works
[06:03:14] <Cork> but as you can't ask the browsers what event listeners it has, this is kinda fake data
[06:03:42] <Cork> bberry: and the length will only work in controlled environments
[06:03:55] <Cork> as this is the internal cache in jquery
[06:04:03] <Cork> and it puts all kind of things in there in normal cases
[06:04:09] <Abhijit> hi.
[06:04:28] <bberry> nice
[06:04:48] <Abhijit> i have div id="result" and i am doing $.ajax({	 url:"http://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack&limit=4",success:function(result)	{$('#result').append(result);}}); and this code do not add the data to that div.
[06:04:52] <Abhijit> help please
[06:04:57] <Cork> bberry: also $.cache is internal so don't expect it to stick around :)
[06:05:42] <Cork> Abhijit: add a fail/error callback and make sure your not getting into that handler
[06:05:55] <Cork> also i would move the parameters out of the url
[06:06:02] <Cork> it is normally more readable
[06:06:21] <Abhijit> ok
[06:07:09] <Cork> Abhijit: $.ajax("http://itunes.apple.com/search", {  data: { term: "jack", limit: 4 }).done(function(result) {$('#result').append(result);}).fail(function() { alert("I FAILED!"); });
[06:07:17] <Cork> should do the same thing as your code
[06:07:29] <bberry> Cork: yeah. its okay, its really just for showing my coworker an example :P
[06:07:57] <Cork> bberry: ya, i suspected as much
[06:08:05] <Cork> bberry: just wanted to be clear :)
[06:08:12] <bberry> haha yeah. thanks XD
[06:13:35] <Abhijit> Cork, not sure if that code works or not. because i need to stop the form submitting after this code. which is not working with your code. it was working before
[06:14:45] <Abhijit> Cork, i am doing return fale after this code. which do not work. with my initial code it was working.
[06:15:33] <Cork> Abhijit: use event.preventDefault() at the beginning of the event function
[06:17:11] <Elirips> Hello. How can I select all 'children' that are 'li' and do not have the id 'XX'?. I have: $("#rootId").children("li"), but how can I now exclude the element with id 'XX'?
[06:19:04] <Cork> $("#rootId").children("li").not('#XX')
[06:19:16] <Cork> Elirips: ^
[06:20:15] <Elirips> Cork: thank you
[06:20:21] <Cork> np
[06:21:27] <Elirips> just wondering: What happens if you have multiple elements in the same DOM that have the same id and then you select for that id? Is the result random?
[06:21:45] <Elirips> or could jquery also handle cases like this, like then returning all elements that match the id?
[06:21:47] <Cork> Elirips: it will remove the first element in the page matching the id
[06:22:04] <Cork> Elirips: you can't ever have more then one element in the page have the same id
[06:22:05] <seutje> it optimizes it through getElementById iirc
[06:22:59] <Cork> Elirips: but ya it loops the list of matches and removes the element if it matches exactly document.getElementById('XX')
[06:24:48] <Abhijit> Cork, ok
[06:29:45] <Abhijit> Cork, i tried to do this and its not working function validateForm(e)	{		event.preventDefault(e);
[06:41:16] <Cork> Abhijit: event.preventDefault(e); => e.preventDefault();
[06:44:49] <newbie|2> hello ... I would like to create smooth transactions between web pages? you have any advice? some indication?
[06:45:26] <frank_o> newbie|2: jQuery Mobile pages maybe?
[06:46:28] <newbie|2> thanks ... now I try ...
[06:47:24] <russ__> heya ,  i call a ajax , in firefox it works good in chrome i get this : "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"   here is my ajax call http://pastie.org/9168615
[06:48:04] <drej> anyone know how to feed meta tags into jsfiddle ?
[06:50:51] <Abhijit> Cork, in your code it never gives failed error. that means the code is working. so why its not appending the data to div?
[06:51:07] <Abhijit> Cork, that mean the original code was also working? except the div append part.
[06:51:25] <Cork> Abhijit: is the done/success callback ever called?
[06:51:45] <Cork> anyway i'm off now
[06:51:52] <Abhijit> okey. nvm.
[06:53:18] <russ__> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function main.js:92 $.ajax.success main.js:92 l jquery.js:4 c.fireWith jquery.js:4 k jquery.js:6 (anonymous function)
[06:53:31] <russ__> chrome
[06:57:48] <russ__> whats wrong with if(data.contains('js-fast-ad-box')) in chrome it dont work in firefox works
[06:58:48] <russ__> ?
[06:58:49] <systemfault> Well
[06:58:57] <russ__> ye_?
[06:59:00] <systemfault> .contains doesn’t really exists at this moment.
[06:59:18] <Abhijit> this is my ajax http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7452499/ which fails and gives two alert messages for error and complete. but if i enter that url manually it gives me output. help please
[06:59:19] <russ__> systemfault so how you would check this ?
[06:59:33] <BillCriswell> russ__: .indexOf()
[06:59:37] <systemfault> russ__: I would use .indexOf(…) !== -1
[07:00:15] <systemfault> .contains is from the next standard…
[07:00:44] <BillCriswell> Abhijit: It probably doesn't allow cross domain requests.
[07:01:36] <BillCriswell> Abhijit: This big error here in the console: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack&limit=4. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://run.jsbin.io' is therefore not allowed access. "
[07:01:47] <systemfault> Abhijit: Also.. I’d be surprised that Apple took POST for their search, it would be retarded
[07:01:56] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, what is cross domain request and how to solve it?
[07:02:08] <Abhijit> systemfault, its apple!
[07:02:19] <Abhijit> ...but i dont know why post is there. this is justa  test code.
[07:02:34] <russ__> systemfault .indexOf(…) !== -1 is always false
[07:02:50] <russ__> systemfault i mean its true allways
[07:03:02] <systemfault> russ__:  if(data.indexOf(‘js-fast-ad-box') !== -1) ?????
[07:03:12] <russ__> systemfault even if the (data) contains the text
[07:03:27] <systemfault> o_O
[07:03:48] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, does that mean, i can not read json from apple.com?
[07:04:07] <BillCriswell> Abhijit: You can use a proxy script or see if you can read up on jsonp, but I doubt they have support for that.
[07:04:35] <systemfault> Abhijit: Like BillCriswell  said… I tried to see if they supported JSONP, doesn’t seem to be the case.
[07:04:37] <russ__> systemfault ye don't work i want to check the (data) coming from ajax if there anywhere contains the string "js-fast-ad-box"
[07:04:40] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, yes. jsonp gives success.
[07:04:48] <Abhijit> systemfault, ^
[07:04:49] <russ__> systemfault .contains worked but didn't in chrome.
[07:05:07] <systemfault> You’re doing something wrong. .indexOf is what you should use.
[07:05:37] <russ__> systemfault look http://pastie.org/9168671
[07:05:39] <systemfault> russ__: .contains is part of ES6, it’s unreleased at this moment…. Firefox already supports some parts of ES6 and this is why it has it.
[07:06:04] <BillCriswell> russ__: A polyfill for contains would be basically indexOf()
[07:06:08] <beancurd> indexof isn't supported in ie<9 fyi
[07:06:22] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, its working with jsonp. how do i append the output of ajax to div? i tried to do success: function (result) {	$('#result').append(result); alert("Success!"); which is not working
[07:06:22] <BillCriswell> That can't possibly be true.
[07:06:28] <BillCriswell> beancurd ^&^
[07:06:43] <BillCriswell> beancurd: No way possible.
[07:06:45] <beancurd> oh sorry. for arrays.
[07:06:52] <BillCriswell> Oh, haha.
[07:06:54] <BillCriswell> Yes that's true.
[07:07:01] <russ__> hm
[07:07:07] <systemfault> beancurd: String#indexOf is supported on old IE, it’s Array#indexOf that isn’t
[07:07:08] <beancurd> had a brainfart just channel hopping on irc.
[07:07:18] <beancurd> nevermind me, continue :)
[07:07:22] <BillCriswell> Haha
[07:07:33] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Yeah we cleared that up.
[07:07:33] <beancurd> *rides away into the fog.
[07:07:39] <BillCriswell> I should have know that's what he meant.
[07:07:44] <BillCriswell> what they meant*
[07:07:50] <BillCriswell> Have to stop "he"ing all the time.
[07:08:11] <BillCriswell> russ__: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/contains#Polyfill
[07:08:39] <BillCriswell> russ__: What is data?
[07:09:00] <russ__> BillCriswell some html output <div etc etc what i need
[07:09:34] <BillCriswell> russ__: and you want to do something if that string exists in there?
[07:09:45] <russ__> BillCriswell yes
[07:09:55] <BillCriswell> data.indexOf('js-fast-ad-box') > -1
[07:10:30] <systemfault> Abhijit: result is probably an object, not a string (I could be wrong)
[07:10:44] <Abhijit> systemfault, yes. working with json.stringify
[07:11:43] <systemfault> Heh… that’s what happens when you use crappy JSONP :/ (Not that we have any other choice if we want to be  compatible with old browsers)
[07:13:28] <BillCriswell> Abhijit: A server side language could grab that data for you and return JSON pretty easily.
[07:13:40] <BillCriswell> Now... knowing if apple wants you to be doing that is another story.
[07:13:55] <systemfault> Well, he got it working :P
[07:14:07] <BillCriswell> Haha, good times!
[07:14:26] <frank_o> I got this rectangle with some parallaxed pictures which expands on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/4/embedded/result/
[07:14:29] <frank_o> How do I prevent the images from "shooting out of view" once the rectangle is hovered though? I'm using https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax and http://packery.metafizzy.co/.
[07:15:36] <russ__> BillCriswell  still dont work
[07:15:48] <apipkin> Is there a danger in calling noConflict multiple times?
[07:16:09] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, okey
[07:16:35] <NoiseEee> apipkin: why would you need to?
[07:17:24] <BillCriswell> russ__: http://jsbin.com/cohodayi/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:17:27] <apipkin> NoiseEee: i'm running into a race condition where jquery isn't loaded before I call noConflict. Then there are other files that  are loaded in the header that use jQuery
[07:18:03] <apipkin> I would much rather get rid of any reason for the noConflict, but that's out of scope right now :-/
[07:18:27] <BillCriswell> You can't call noConflict() before jQuery is loaded.
[07:19:04] <apipkin> BillCriswell: right :) that's what the problem is right now
[07:19:55] <apipkin> it's being called before jquery is loaded. So i was going to do `jQuery && jQuery.noConflict();` , but to catch it if it fails, I was going to run that later on as well.
[07:19:58] <BillCriswell> I'm having a hard time following what you're doing so I might have to sit this one out.
[07:21:56] <apipkin> I have something like https://gist.github.com/apipkin/91e84160b6a852dccb79 and that's causing race conditions in IE8
[07:22:42] <apipkin> and sadly we cannot remove prototype just yet
[07:23:26] <BillCriswell> You think that prototype.js is loaded before the stuff before it?
[07:24:26] <apipkin> Nope. Just don't know when jQuery is loaded at all. I don't want to clobber prototype and none of our code uses $ unless it's in a closure
[07:25:10] <BillCriswell> It's loaded first in the example you gave me.
[07:26:06] <Abhijit> BillCriswell, systemfault in this json http://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack&limit=4 how do i access indivisual artistname in my jquery?
[07:26:58] <systemfault> Abhijit: .results[0].artistName ?
[07:27:35] <Abhijit> systemfault, yes.
[07:29:33] <Abhijit> systemfault, can i use .text instead of .append to replace the old text with new one fir the div?
[07:29:36] <Abhijit> for
[07:29:44] <Abhijit> or .html?
[07:30:02] <systemfault> replace?
[07:30:06] <Abhijit> yes
[07:30:14] <systemfault> I don’t even know what you’re trying to do
[07:30:15] <systemfault> :/
[07:30:16] <Abhijit> systemfault, take the artist name from json and put in div?
[07:30:28] <systemfault> Abhijit: There are 4 artists?
[07:30:32] <Abhijit> yes
[07:30:35] <systemfault> do you want a list?
[07:30:50] <Abhijit> systemfault, no. seperate div for each artist name.
[07:31:08] <systemfault> Abhijit: I would build a string a html and .append it
[07:31:17] <Abhijit> systemfault, actualy its not div. its  a href ="#tabs-1"
[07:32:23] <systemfault> I’d do something like var html = $.map(foo.results, function(result) { return ‘<a href=“”>’ + result.artistName + ’</a>’;}).join(‘’);
[07:32:32] <systemfault> And then append the html somewhere.
[07:33:08] <Abhijit> systemfault, nvm.
[07:42:51] <alxy> hello, Im having again a problem with binding a (custom) event handler on elements that do not exist when the site loads. They are added dynamically via js in the future. fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hRR9y/ It works just fine for the static element shown in thr html-box, but it doesnt work at all in the bootbox-modal
[07:43:01] <alxy> any ideas on how to solve tht?
[07:44:55] <apipkin> Actually it looks like my problem stems from localhost on the VM not pointing to my dev machine
[07:47:28] <Abhijit> i have <div id="tabs-1"> and $('div.title1').click(function(){ is not working i want to call one function whenever user clicks on that div.
[07:47:54] <mikunos> hi guys, I am trying to handle a simple user form using the inline editing mode and I am trying to create a simple procedure that helps me to reach this target: http://snipet.co.uk/Ov
[07:48:30] <mikunos> the problem is the focusout(). It isn't fired.
[07:48:53] <mikunos> what's wrong?
[07:55:54] <mikunos> any hint?
[07:59:38] <Fernandos> hey :)
[08:02:02] <Fernandos> I've looked around, but couldn't find a plugin that shows a nice infobar like this http://www.dreasgrech.com/upload/extinfobar/ but for any browser  (only the infobar part)
[08:02:59] <Fernandos> Do you have any ideas? This code, works but is super ugly and refactoring wouldn't be even worth it: http://jsbin.com/xevihase/3/edit
[08:06:41] <shwaiil> Just noticed someone mentioning this itemData.Value == @Model.ID. What's @Model ? never seen that before
[08:07:48] <Abhijit> how do i read tabs text value in jq?
[08:07:53] <Abhijit> using jq ui tabs?
[08:08:26] <Fernandos> Abhijit: you get values using $('#id').val()
[08:09:28] <Abhijit> Fernandos, artst = $("title1").val(); does not work with jq tabs.
[08:26:00] <russ__> how js uploader works ? its an ajax call ?
[08:26:57] <sledgeDJ> hey all. I have some code that I am trying to fix invovling some radio buttons. issue is i rather not make the code avilable for all to see. is there anyone that can please MSG me so they can help me in private?
[08:29:04] <pcfreak30> sledgeDJ: I learned this the card way. Everyone in here is a coder, so they can all make what your doing. And honestly I have found no one really cares to steal anyones work. We are generally busy enough pn our own projects. If you need private help, hire a consultant.
[08:29:34] <sledgeDJ> pcfreak30: i am not scared they will steal the code
[08:30:15] <pcfreak30> Well theres no other reason I see to not post it. No one really cares. Everyone here is here to help or get help.
[08:30:43] <BillCriswell> sledgeDJ: No one wants to steal your code, promise.
[08:30:53] <pcfreak30> sledgeDJ: I have gone the same route and gotten flammed for it
[08:31:02] <pcfreak30> Ive posted private code
[08:31:12] <pcfreak30> And nothing bad happened so far
[08:31:20] <sledgeDJ> it is not that i am affraid that the code will be stolen
[08:31:30] <pcfreak30> I think MOST code post is "propietary" in this chan
[08:31:34] <sledgeDJ> it is just that i think it will clog the channel with horsecrap
[08:31:38] <BillCriswell> sledgeDJ: Make a minimal test example if you're really worried about that. That usually clears up 90% of peoples issues anyway.
[08:31:39] <pcfreak30> Oh
[08:31:47] <BillCriswell> sledgeDJ: jsfiddle.net
[08:31:48] <pcfreak30> sledgeDJ: You pt on padtir
[08:31:53] <pcfreak30> DONT paste in the irc
[08:32:00] <pcfreak30> you will get banned/muted
[08:32:03] <BillCriswell> Then click "Share" and give us that link.
[08:32:09] <thebope> Yea unless its a one liner, bad idea
[08:32:31] <thebope> and not one of those 800 char one lines that makes you toast when you wake up in the morning
[08:32:31] <sledgeDJ> ok here is the issue...
[08:32:47] <pcfreak30> Now as for a question I have. Any there any requiv to CHTTPRequest::xSendFile in yii2?
[08:32:57] <pcfreak30> equiv
[08:33:10] <pcfreak30> Need to do a file download over API
[08:35:32] <sledgeDJ> if you click on this link, https://www.garciniacambogiaspremium.com/cart_new/secure/?addtocart=rXXdEyb8lrqlsEe0mIPhO2shXicyDQc8tesReAMQnR8=&a=525770 you will see a checkout page. if you select change ship country from USA you should see that that shipping price changes. this works fine. the problem is the form has a hidden field calld "totalShip" this value doesnt change when changing country it only changes when you actually then se
[08:36:23] <Monkey_b> hey guys i need some pointers... whats the best way to determine if someone has scrolled to the bottom of a div? i want to implement lazy-loading where i bring in additional content via ajax as the user scrolls down
[08:36:38] <sledgeDJ> someone else coded this mess and i am trying to clean it up
[08:36:56] <ipatrol> is anyone familiar with datatables
[08:37:12] <Monkey_b> ipatrol: a little
[08:37:15] <jphase> Monkey_b: http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/
[08:37:39] <ipatrol> Monkey_b: I'm getting an error I've seen online, but the answers there aren't much more helpful:  Requested unknown parameter '0' for row 0
[08:38:02] <ipatrol> that occurs on table initialization
[08:38:26] <pcfreak30> ipatrol: you mean datatables.net?
[08:38:40] <ipatrol> no, .js
[08:39:02] <pcfreak30> i mean is it the jquery datatables plugin?
[08:39:06] <ipatrol> yes
[08:39:11] <Monkey_b> jphase: i did see scrollTop, but how do i use it to determine when ive reached the bottom of the div? it reports '0' when im all the way at the top, but how would i check when its reached the bottom?
[08:39:22] <pcfreak30> ipatrol: ok its homepage is  datatables.net
[08:39:42] <ipatrol> oh, I thought by .net you were thinking .NET
[08:39:44] <Monkey_b> ipatrol: sounds like it may be related to your data binding?
[08:39:52] <ipatrol> let me pastebin a snippet
[08:40:48] <ipatrol> http://pastebin.com/bVaJGDv1
[08:40:54] <Monkey_b> lets see
[08:41:29] <ipatrol> that's the initialization/update function
[08:42:21] <Monkey_b> ipatrol: what does mktab(val) return?
[08:42:58] <ipatrol> a 2-d array constituting the values of the table's data
[08:43:11] <thebope> sledgeDJ, I haven't looked but could you add a .onchange listener to the change shipping country input that does something like $("#totalShip").val(Your_value_here)
[08:43:17] <ipatrol> *excluding* the header, which is static
[08:43:41] <ipatrol> but the header isn't data
[08:43:58] <Monkey_b> you're positive the column counts match up with your headers?
[08:44:11] <ipatrol> let me check again
[08:44:46] <Monkey_b> that error sounds eerily familiar like one i once encountered for that same reason
[08:45:24] <ipatrol> probably is, http://datatables.net/manual/tech-notes/4
[08:45:46] <jphase> Monkey_b: one sec, I'll write an example for you
[08:46:08] <Monkey_b> k
[08:46:16] <Monkey_b> maybe jsfiddle ?
[08:47:08] <ipatrol> I use FF's web console
[08:47:19] <ipatrol> I think I might have found a problem
[08:48:10] <ipatrol> mktab(0) returns a length-12 array of undefined objects
[08:48:23] <Monkey_b> thats no good
[08:49:21] <jphase> Monkey_b: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pw4na/
[08:50:02] <Monkey_b> jphase: thank you :)
[08:50:22] <Monkey_b> jphase: super helpful
[08:50:42] <jphase> np
[08:51:28] <ipatrol> let me dissect some of these functions so I can inspect the call stack
[08:55:06] <ipatrol> hey, I think I might have found the root cause
[08:55:25] <ipatrol> an array of text is being treated as an array of numbers by accident
[08:56:22] <ipatrol> I originally wrote the page using the ECMA6 "Harmony" features, but I tried to rewrite is in ECMA5 once I realized that only FF supported it
[08:56:56] <ipatrol> in the process, I replaced a lot of "arr.keys()" with "arr"
[08:57:31] <ipatrol> I should have replaced them with "_.keys(arr)"
[08:57:39] <ipatrol> (underscore.js)
[08:57:40] <Monkey_b> ah
[08:57:50] <ipatrol> *tried to rewrite it
[08:58:07] <Monkey_b> that makes sense
[08:58:23] <Monkey_b> is it working now?
[08:59:53] <ipatrol> gimme a sec, I have to rewrite it in several places
[09:02:11] <ipatrol> I have to go, but I think I got it, ttfn
[09:08:25] <Berto> Hi - I'm trying to find some good code for jQuery-based tabbed content. There's SO many examples out there... what should I look for?  Are there any that are most popular?
[09:08:46] <duch_kazatel> Berto whichever seems best for your situation :)
[09:09:00] <Berto> duch_kazatel, haha i'm completely overwhelmed for now!
[09:09:17] <Berto> https://github.com/JangoSteve/jQuery-EasyTabs   seems to have tons of followers... but lots of issues too, which concerns me
[09:09:20] <duch_kazatel> you're just trying to build out tabs?
[09:10:02] <Berto> duch_kazatel, yeah, pretty basic stuff.  Each tab for each size (1kg, 2kg, 5kg).  Typically just a few tabs
[09:10:20] <duch_kazatel> if that's all you need, you could pretty easily build that out yourself.
[09:13:46] <shwaiil> Q: When <section contenteditable="true">Foo foo foo</section>, let's say I changed the html content of this element and put it back, the cursor is placed in the start, how to put after the text ? Thanks
[09:14:29] <duch_kazatel> shwaiil a: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19588665/923919
[09:15:13] <shwaiil> duch_kazatel: thanks for looking!
[09:15:29] <duch_kazatel> shwaiil ;)
[09:22:45] <Velveeta> http://xkcd.com/1367/
[09:23:10] <duch_kazatel> ++
[09:23:24] <Velveeta> mobile web apps ftw
[09:24:41] <BillCriswell> Do you think he's serious about that realization?
[09:25:11] <BillCriswell> That's like the main reason why I don't have any real interest in native apps haha
[09:25:18] <Velveeta> i don't know if he is or not, i just hope other people see the value in maintaining a single SoA codebase and wrapping it in something like phonegap for mobile deployment
[09:26:46] <BillCriswell> If the "Add To Homescreen" was a more popular feature I bet a lot more people would realize it.
[09:28:50] <frank_o> Sup guys! COuld you guys check? I got this rectangle with some parallaxed pictures which expands on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/4/embedded/result/
[09:29:23] <BillCriswell> A nice, standard way to request that type of action would be awesome. I'm not sure Apple and Google really want that yet.
[09:29:38] <frank_o> Problem is, the moment it expands, the offset between ones mouse hovering and the 0,0 of the parallax wrapper increases dramatically... causing the additional "shooting out of frame" effect.. anybody know how to fix it?
[09:30:00] <beancurd> BillCriswell: i've used those obvoxous dropdown (install to homescreen) tooltips in the past.
[09:30:04] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell looks like all you need is: <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
[09:30:07] <beancurd> did you mean something like that?
[09:30:30] <beancurd> http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen
[09:30:46] <BillCriswell> beancurd: I've seen those, definitely not those lol. I want like... basically the request ot use the camera or geolocation type deal.
[09:31:13] <frank_o> beancurd: cool plug
[09:31:16] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Will that add like a "add to homescreen" type dialog to the site?
[09:31:53] <BillCriswell> beancurd: My issue with this is it can change depending on OS and everything else.
[09:31:58] <beancurd> frank_o: not mine, but it was the one i used.
[09:32:06] <duch_kazatel> nope - just lets you choose that option from the menu.
[09:32:12] <Velveeta> http://gizmodo.com/5977989/internet-explorer-vs-murder-rate-will-be-your-favorite-chart-today
[09:32:24] <beancurd> BillCriswell: ah right, well i think that one there is ios specific, probably through some useragent detection
[09:32:34] <frank_o> beancurd: Do you like wait a while to make sure the user is actually an active participant of your app before you run that popup?
[09:33:07] <BillCriswell> beancurd: Yes. I want to go way beyond that. Bookmarks with app icons everywhere that are easy to add!
[09:33:16] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Hahaha
[09:33:31] <beancurd> with the site we used it on, the user was pretty much an active participant as soon as they landed on the site, because the site was an interal portal thing that was only advertised in a physical mailout.
[09:34:53] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:34:55] <frank_o> nice
[09:35:31] <kegster> p
[09:35:37] <duch_kazatel> q
[09:36:09] <BillCriswell> frank_o: I think of it as almost a social media icon type action. We can get a nice little universal icon for install and go from there.
[09:36:53] <BillCriswell> I think a small rounded rectangle with a plus can easily convey an "app install"
[09:37:01] <BillCriswell> I love thinking about this shit.
[09:37:06] <frank_o> ehehe
[09:37:19] <frank_o> well ur a dreamer and a poet
[09:37:49] <BillCriswell> It doesn't seem like you can add an app to the home screen through iOS chrome. Boooo
[09:38:02] <duch_kazatel> prolly because of apple.
[09:38:10] <BillCriswell> Yeah, no doubt.
[09:38:32] <BillCriswell> I doubt they want everything going the way of the web. Can't charge 99c to use a website.... yet.
[09:39:01] <BillCriswell> Well, can't do it seemlessly as the app store does it or have control over the whole experience.
[09:39:56] <duch_kazatel> 99 cents per domain!  there yer charging structure.
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> *there's
[09:40:17] <BillCriswell> In-Site Purchases!
[09:40:23] <duch_kazatel> nnnnnoooo
[09:40:34] <BillCriswell> I honestly can't believe they went with automatic app updates.
[09:40:42] <duch_kazatel> who apple?
[09:40:45] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:41:02] <duch_kazatel> we get them unless permissions changed.
[09:41:03] <BillCriswell> The only time I went into the app store was when I had updates. That's the only time I looked around in there and they turned it off.
[09:41:20] <skypce> hello guys
[09:41:29] <BillCriswell> I wonder if that made a difference on their app sales.
[09:41:38] <duch_kazatel> probably not.
[09:42:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Which is good because it's an awesome feature.
[09:42:14] <BillCriswell> I wonder how much data they collected before making that move.
[09:42:19] <skypce> i need this progressbar but with linked steps (it advances when i press steps circles) can you help me please
[09:42:21] <skypce> http://www.google.cl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=15&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CH0QFjAO&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcodepen.io%2Fbrenothales%2Fdetails%2Fqkgnf&ei=b_lwU5SxIqPJsQSZ4oKgBA&usg=AFQjCNEDriVX_737AAqSOogZVk1xxVOFSg&sig2=arXN26G8uBqVOtNWqqKPEg
[09:42:57] <skypce> i need this progressbar but with linked steps (it advances when i press steps circles) can you help me pleasehttp://codepen.io/brenothales/details/qkgnf
[09:43:01] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i mean, let's be honest, iphone sales haven't kept growing, so the audience is changing a bit.
[09:43:10] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher you only need to ask once ;)
[09:43:30] <duch_kazatel> err, skypce
[09:43:38] <duch_kazatel> also, those are linked for me.
[09:43:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: true.
[09:43:54] <skypce> yes sorry duch_kazatel i was paste the google search :S
[09:44:13] <duch_kazatel> skypce i mean that the pen is doing exactly what you're asking for.
[09:44:58] <skypce> duch_kazatel, not, it haves next button, i want clicked steps circles :)
[09:45:18] <duch_kazatel> skypce right - you click on a circle and it takes you to that step.
[09:46:37] <duch_kazatel> ah it looks like it's only clickable if you're past that partcular point.  shouldn't be hard to change to do what you want.
[09:47:59] <skypce> yes
[09:48:02] <skypce> wait me i go to lunch
[09:54:06] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i have javascript: the good parts sitting at ym desk and I can't read it right now :(
[09:57:46] <il> What is a good way to create a loading animation progress bar when loading data on a page in jquery?
[09:58:17] <skypce> hello i am back
[09:58:39] <duch_kazatel> il how long is the user waiting generally?
[09:58:59] <il> ~0.5-2 seconds, duch_kazatel
[09:59:09] <skypce> jeje
[09:59:14] <skypce> ultra fast lunch
[09:59:21] <duch_kazatel> il then do a normal ajax spinner instead of a progressbar.
[09:59:33] <skypce> spinner?
[09:59:37] <il> That's not what my boss wants
[09:59:39] <skypce> i will search for spinner component
[09:59:48] <duch_kazatel> skypce that was meant for il, not you.
[10:00:28] <skypce> ahh sorry
[10:00:39] <skypce> i need this progressbar but with linked steps (it advances when i press steps circles) can you help me pleasehttp://codepen.io/brenothales/details/qkgnf
[10:00:55] <duch_kazatel> skypce did you have a specific question about how to accomplish that?
[10:01:14] <duch_kazatel> il that's going to be tricky - you'll have to know the size of the download and then track progress.
[10:01:20] <il> Yea
[10:01:31] <il> And even before that
[10:01:38] <il> How can I listen for AJAX requests
[10:01:48] <duch_kazatel> global ajax events :)
[10:02:06] <BillCriswell> il: Checkout $.ajaxSetup
[10:02:10] <duch_kazatel> unless you have access to the original codebase, in which case, you should extend the current method.
[10:02:40] <il> I do
[10:02:49] <il> global ajax events seems easier though
[10:02:58] <duch_kazatel> il then use beforeSend() and done()
[10:02:59] <il> what are the disadvantages of using global?
[10:03:12] <duch_kazatel> you're unnecessarily binding to a scope you might not need to.
[10:03:50] <il> ah
[10:04:10] <duch_kazatel> also: imagine being the dev running maintenence down the road trying to figure out wtf is going on ;)
[10:04:13] <il> I'm guessing there aren't any built in functions that detects the size of the ajax download?
[10:04:29] <il> And tracks how much has been downloaded over time?
[10:04:53] <duch_kazatel> there are progress events on XMLHttpRequest iirc.
[10:05:56] <il> oh ok, thanks
[10:06:00] <il> checking that out
[10:06:07] <il> wonder why jquery wouldn't have any
[10:06:22] <duch_kazatel> i haven't looked in a while.  it might.
[10:06:45] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Monitoring_progress there's the MDN bit you care about.
[10:07:11] <il> thanks duch_kazatel
[10:08:17] <il> All of the requests are ajax though. Would I have to rewrite the functions using XMLHttpRequest?
[10:08:23] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:08:43] <il> The eventListener checks for AJAX requests too?
[10:08:45] <duch_kazatel> this is dated, but it'll show you how to do this: http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[10:08:52] <il> thanks very much, again
[10:09:03] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:09:12] <duch_kazatel> anything to save me from my current refactor.
[10:09:36] <il> hahaha
[10:13:06] <fels_zh> i have an issue wehre ios mobile safari is NOT rememebring cookies on the second back button click
[10:17:18] <[OES]> !help
[10:17:27] <[OES]> oops wrong !
[10:19:13] <duch_kazatel> [OES] need help?
[10:19:41] <[OES]> Folks, I have a modal window with a duplicate form. The datepicker selects right but fills the value in the form on the page
[10:19:45] <[OES]> See http://screencast.com/t/fKSyCwKEs4G
[10:19:53] <duch_kazatel> [OES] can you paste an example up somewhere?
[10:20:38] <[OES]> duch_kazatel The files have the same name hence why I am guessing what it is doing
[10:20:45] <[OES]> fields !
[10:21:03] <duch_kazatel> [OES] it's almost impossible to help unless i can play with your code.
[10:21:07] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ [OES]
[10:21:23] <duch_kazatel> oh b-ot isn't here.
[10:21:36] <[OES]> Yea as !help didnt work :-)
[10:21:47] <duch_kazatel> [OES] paste up on jsfiddle if possible.
[10:22:49] <[OES]> duch_kazatel  I dont think I can replicate it on jsfiddle as the modal window is an ajax event
[10:23:03] <[OES]> duch_kazatel  let me put up something though
[10:23:10] <duch_kazatel> [OES] you should be able to copy the output markup
[10:24:30] <cybered2> hey people, i try to have a dynamic list of rows in a table, but somehow my indices does not match. i assume iam updating them wrong. please have a look. i made a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CWz6D/ ... second jsfiddle in my live :D
[10:25:26] <cybered2> additional info: for framework convenience the current number of rows must be in id-TOTAL
[10:28:38] <duch_kazatel> !mdn xmlhttprequest
[10:28:38] <duch_b0t> duch_kazatel: XMLHttpRequest - Web API Interfaces | MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest>
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> woop
[10:28:44] <duch_kazatel> !help
[10:28:44] <duch_b0t> duch_kazatel: For help, ask your question. Be patient. Code samples should be pasted in a paste service (see !paste). Tell us 1) what you want to happen, 2) what is actually happening, and 3) any error messages you find (see !debug).
[10:29:30] <duch_kazatel> at least until b-ot comes back.
[10:33:23] <cybered2> i updated the fiddle, there was a mistake not related to my problem, TOTAL was not set right initially.  http://jsfiddle.net/CWz6D/1/
[10:33:48] <duch_kazatel> cybered2 that's a lot of code to add rows to a table.
[10:34:00] <duch_kazatel> also:  href="javascript:void(0)" don't do this.
[10:35:35] <bufferloss> is there a way to detect cross domain errors in ajax requests?
[10:35:57] <bufferloss> I’ve googled for a bit and I see a lot of posts about getting them to work, but I merely want to see if the error that triggered my callback was because of a cross domain error
[10:36:15] <bufferloss> the error status code is 0 in that case, but checking for a 0 error status seems problematic or unreliable
[10:38:42] <DeltaHeavy> bufferloss: How does it seem problematic and unreliable?
[10:38:49] <[OES]> duch_kazatel  Thks for your time. I got it fixed, They had duplicate ID's !
[10:38:52] <DeltaHeavy> Lots and lots of software rely on status codes like that :p
[10:39:34] <Jattenalle> bufferloss, you're right, you shouldnt check for 0
[10:39:45] <Jattenalle> you should check for the actual constant, NO_ERROR or somesuchlikethat
[10:40:07] <Jattenalle> error codes are not numbers, don't treat them like ones
[10:41:31] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: hmm, ok, does that get passe through jqXHR?
[10:41:39] <Jattenalle> i don't know
[10:41:40] <bufferloss> and where are those constants defined? $.NO_ERROR or something?
[10:42:02] <Jattenalle> well it's not a jquery thing
[10:42:05] <Jattenalle> it's part of AJAX
[10:42:14] <Jattenalle> so you'd have to look up the HTTP error codes
[10:42:29] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: except there is no code in this case, it’s just 0
[10:42:45] <Jattenalle> if you want more error details from a failed jquery .get you need to call the standard ajax stuff
[10:42:50] <bufferloss> which presumably means the request didn’t even happen, though obviously my browser tried to make the request, as evident from chrome console
[10:43:07] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: ok, and when you say “call the standard ajax stuff’ what would that entail
[10:43:16] <bufferloss> it’s been a long time since I’ve made an XMLHttpRequest manually
[10:43:18] <Jattenalle> it's .responseText
[10:43:24] <Jattenalle> no no
[10:43:27] <bufferloss> is there some method I can call that’ll retrieve the last known  request error
[10:43:35] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() i think they mean.
[10:43:40] <bufferloss> hmm, ok I am echoing responseText already
[10:43:46] <Jattenalle> in the ajax or get return function
[10:43:47] <bufferloss> it’s actually blank in this case
[10:43:49] <Jattenalle> you get an object
[10:43:55] <Jattenalle> that you can do .responseText on
[10:43:59] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: yes responseText comes form jqXHR
[10:44:02] <Jattenalle> well, if you get nothing from that
[10:44:02] <bufferloss> which i asked about earlier
[10:44:05] <Jattenalle> you're out of luck
[10:44:12] <bufferloss> ok, that’s what I wanted to know thanks
[10:44:15] <Jattenalle> also, cross-domain ajax isnt supposed to work
[10:44:19] <Jattenalle> for security reasons
[10:44:32] <bufferloss> I’m fairly well aware of many of the issues surrounding cors
[10:45:35] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle huh?  sure it is - as long as the server allows it.
[10:45:50] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, uh, the browser shouldnt allow it
[10:45:53] <Jattenalle> same origin policy
[10:46:04] <duch_kazatel> right - that's what CORS is for.
[10:46:08] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: it’s not really a browser issue, it’s a server issue
[10:46:19] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, oh, i missed the bit where he said he was using cors
[10:46:29] <Jattenalle> yeah my bad
[10:46:49] <duch_kazatel> i just saw the blanket statment and thought i'd step in.
[10:47:18] <Jattenalle> you may not be the hero we deserve, but you are the hero we need ;)
[10:47:22] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[10:49:43] <bufferloss> it’s less about “using cors"
[10:49:54] <bufferloss> again the issue is not getting it to work, it works most of the time, and it’s a cors request
[10:50:09] <bufferloss> but, sometimes the API (of which I have no control) breaks, and sometimes the error is actually a real error like a 500 or a 404
[10:50:30] <bufferloss> but sometimes their shit goes down and the error we get when making the ajax request(s) is a access control allow origin error
[10:50:40] <Jattenalle> hm, so the issue is you get an "everything is ok" but no actual data?
[10:50:40] <bufferloss> was just hoping there’d be a way to detect in the error handler, the reason for the error
[10:50:49] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: mmm, not quite
[10:51:05] <bufferloss> we didn’t write nor do we have control of the API
[10:51:13] <bufferloss> the people who write the API break it regularly and claim that we broke it
[10:51:14] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss you could look at the .fail() (or done) hanlder and see what all objects you can pass in.
[10:51:21] <bufferloss> I’m trying to make a test to prove that its their fault
[10:51:33] <Jattenalle> how do you call the cors?
[10:51:34] <bufferloss> (occasionally it may be our fault but it’s usually their fault)
[10:51:49] <Jattenalle> how does the client call the cors server that is
[10:51:55] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: well, ajax automatically adds the cross domain headers for you as far as I can tell from steping through the jquery code base
[10:52:06] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: well our client simply calls with $.ajax afaik
[10:52:11] <bufferloss> and most of the time things work
[10:52:18] <bufferloss> sometimes the API breaks and gives a real error like a 404
[10:52:24] <bufferloss> sometimes the API breaks and gives a real error like a 500
[10:52:43] <bufferloss> sometimes the API breaks and we get a cors type error and the error callback just gets a status of 0
[10:52:48] <BillCriswell> I think today is a Talking Heads day.
[10:52:49] <bufferloss> no response or anything cuz the request never happens
[10:52:58] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown - those are the three objects you can pass to the error handler.
[10:53:07] <Jattenalle> bufferloss, hrm, ^^
[10:53:22] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss so you can check the textStatus and errorThrown and go from there maybe?
[10:53:24] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: yeah I know, jqXHR.responseText is empty and jqXHR.status is 0
[10:53:29] <bufferloss> in the case when there’s a cors error
[10:53:37] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss what's the textStatus?
[10:53:40] <bufferloss> which usually means their backend db server is down entirely and the proxy can’t find it
[10:53:45] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: empty as well
[10:53:55] <bufferloss> so the proxy throws a cors error for some reason
[10:54:08] <Jattenalle> what error does it throw?
[10:54:21] <duch_kazatel> you'll probably have to bake up a one-off handler for this case.
[10:54:24] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: i’m not really sure given that jqXHR seems to be mostly empty
[10:55:03] <bufferloss> it’s also not that big of a deal, the test I wrote still correctly says FAIL!!! in all these cases
[10:55:07] <Jattenalle> bufferloss, *shrug* can you detect it programatically? when there's an error i mean.. if so, just make it re-do the request X times before showing a generic "Error happened! Oh no!"
[10:55:16] <bufferloss> was just hoping maybe there would be a way to detect their proxy throwing cors stuff specifically
[10:55:33] <bufferloss> Jattenalle: yeah I could do that, but I’d rather just leave it generic and let it fail
[10:55:40] <Jattenalle> yeah that works too
[10:55:46] <bufferloss> cuz either way the point is to tell them “wank off, go fix your API, it’s not our fault"
[10:55:54] <Jattenalle> i dont think there's any way to detect it when the mid-point fails so to speak
[10:56:00] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss nope - the XHR object basically only sees what you see, if that makes sense.  it doesn't know anything beyond that.
[10:56:01] <Jattenalle> or rather, any way to get any useful data
[10:56:02] <bufferloss> yeah, that’s what it seems like
[10:56:15] <bufferloss> chrome console however does know why the request failed
[10:56:23] <duch_kazatel> oh?
[10:56:25] <bufferloss> it seemed reasonable to suppose maybe I could garner that info from within JS
[10:56:39] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: yeah, console says XML access control origin blahy blah blah
[10:56:43] <bufferloss> but jqXHR is just 0 and empty
[10:56:53] <bufferloss> which basically makes sense since the request is simply never even made in the first place
[10:56:53] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss what's the full error in the console?
[10:56:59] <bufferloss> so of course the jqXHR object will be empty
[10:57:14] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: lol wish I could remember, it hasn’t happened in a while and I haven’t copy pasted the error to save it yet
[10:57:19] <bufferloss> I’m sure it’ll happen again soon
[10:57:47] <duch_kazatel> you mean the No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' error?
[10:57:56] <bufferloss> I think it’s this “XMLHttpRequest cannot load **. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://run.jsbin.com' is therefore not allowed access."
[10:58:10] <bufferloss> that basically looks like exactly what I get in console (but of course, only some times)
[10:58:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's the generic "CORS isn't enabled" error.
[10:58:14] <bufferloss> most of the time the API works
[10:58:25] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: right, which is their fault on their server side
[10:58:32] <bufferloss> usually indicating that the thing behind the proxy is down/broken
[10:58:45] <bufferloss> cuz most of the time our code makes the request successfully with no modification
[10:59:00] <bufferloss> we are sending the right cors headers, I’ve checked the console network tab
[10:59:23] <bufferloss> anyway, not a big deal I’m just gonna leave it as is, it’s good enough
[10:59:32] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss you should be able to get that error back in your JS, but fair enough.
[10:59:48] <bufferloss> yeah it seems like that error should be catchable from JS but I just don’t know how
[11:00:03] <bufferloss> and all the posts on SO are about “my cors doesn’t work” but that’s not my issue, it works most of the time
[11:00:14] <bufferloss> i just want to detect when the error IS a cors error vs when it’s e.g. a 404 or a 500
[11:00:31] <bufferloss> wonder if I can catch it as an exception actually...
[11:01:41] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah http://stackoverflow.com/a/6734427/923919
[11:01:43] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[11:03:20] <gtek1k> for a page with a ton of images, i've seen where spinner graphics take the place of the image, then fade out on load... any recommendations to a simple/easy plugin/script that does this? I've found a bunch but curious if anyone can recommend a specific one.
[11:05:21] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: hmm, nice well that doesn’t look like quite what I need, but one of the links in the sidebar for that one does look promising http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19325314/how-to-detect-cross-origin-cors-error-vs-other-types-of-errors-for-xmlhttpreq?rq=1
[11:06:48] <duch_kazatel> bufferloss the answer was elaborating on WHY you can't get that error message/.
[11:06:52] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: erg… and the answer seems to be, that it’s not possible :/
[11:06:57] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: ah ok
[11:06:59] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[11:07:15] <bufferloss> yeah aight well no worries, the test is good enough for us to be able to tell them to politely go **** themselves :)
[11:07:24] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:07:29] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel: thx for the info
[11:07:30] <bufferloss> latz
[11:08:43] <duch_kazatel> yaaay b-ot is back!
[11:11:00] <Guest50001> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/unable-to-report-a-bug-to-bugs-jquery-com#14737000005292995
[11:11:12] <Guest50001> the bug tracker is down!
[11:11:58] <duch_kazatel> wrong channel
[11:12:08] <Guest50001> where should I go
[11:12:42] <duch_kazatel> probably #jquery=dev
[11:12:46] <duch_kazatel> err #jquery-dev
[11:13:24] <Guest50001> thx
[11:13:30] <duch_kazatel> they probably know btw ;)
[11:13:39] <duch_kazatel> your forum post all ready got a response.
[11:13:49] <BillCriswell> If you care to run by us what you think is a bug we might be able to help?
[11:14:40] <duch_kazatel> Dave Methvin is on it over there it looks like.
[11:16:33] <BillCriswell> There must be some real nerds in there.
[11:17:08] <BillCriswell> Extremely wise for staying out of here.
[11:23:22] <duch_kazatel> hahahahahahah
[11:23:28] <duch_kazatel> that's probably true.
[11:31:04] <gtek1k> hmm anyone any feedback on my Q?
[11:31:33] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k i don't have any particular favorites.
[11:31:48] <gtek1k> how about any recommendation
[11:32:00] <duch_kazatel> setup your site so you don't need them ;)
[11:32:07] <duch_kazatel> but in all seriousness, not really.
[11:37:34] <jphase> gtek1k: you don't need a plugin for that, you can just place a loading graphic over the top of images as they load and remove them on .load
[11:37:40] <jphase> er... on load rather
[11:37:52] <gtek1k> jphase, that will work for each image individually?
[11:37:57] <jphase> sure
[11:38:10] <gtek1k> so its a for loop or each ?
[11:38:46] <jphase> either that or just change your markup to have the loading div/image and remove it when that image is done loading
[11:38:58] <jphase> often times works best with a containing div
[11:39:04] <gtek1k> ya thats all dandy
[11:39:18] <gtek1k> so if I have 100 images on a page how to make it so each has its own mini function
[11:39:38] <jphase> $('img').on('load', function() { // Use $(this) in here });
[11:39:56] <duch_kazatel> no need to do any extra work - jquery handles that bit for you.
[11:39:56] <gtek1k> which would be like $(this).find('.loader').remove();
[11:40:20] <duch_kazatel> maybe not .find(), but something similar.
[11:40:26] <gtek1k> sweet seems super easy let me give it a shot
[11:40:37] <gtek1k> ya .next or w/e
[11:40:46] <gtek1k> cause it has to be right on the img tag
[11:40:50] <gtek1k> cool let me give it a shot
[11:47:35] <sl33k_> I have this IIFE in my .js http://pastebin.com/WR8ZbaAZ However on clicking my button the event does not fire. What gives? Also there is no error message in console.
[11:51:33] <thebope> you can't just make the function non anonymous and add it it inline? <button id="reset" onclick="yourfunction">?
[11:52:19] <thebope> I'm not particularly familiar with that style either (function(){})();
[11:52:35] <thebope> Might it be easy to use the document.ready function?
[11:52:45] <thebope> You're not using any jquery as far as I can tell either
[11:52:55] <thebope> Not that you'd need to, but you could try ##javascript
[11:52:59] <thebope> or #javascript
[11:54:19] <thebope> sl33k_, I think you at least need to have something like "$(document).ready" or "$(..." at the beginning of your code there.
[11:55:11] <sl33k_> thebope: you are right in that I am not using jquery.
[11:55:29] <sl33k_> will check ready
[11:55:33] <NoiseEee> so why asking in jquery
[11:55:51] <thebope> sl33k_, I don't think document.ready functionality is supported out of box with JavaScript. the jQuery source for that function is actually a fair bit of code
[11:56:15] <thebope> there's window.ready which runs after everything is loaded but I don't know if that is sufficient for you
[11:58:50] <maxer> anyone familiar with jquery file upload? i have loaded the default example and setup all the paths and still the button is dsiabled by default,. any ideas on why this is? this is the code… http://pastebin.com/3JPGQJx4
[11:59:20] <maxer> i tried implementing the ocde into my own code but that didnt work so im trying something simpler
[12:03:42] <gtek1k> hmm jphase the load doesnt seem to be working
[12:03:51] <gtek1k> does it go in the doc ready or outside?
[12:04:31] <jphase> you can stick it in doc ready if you want, shouldn't be an issue
[12:04:36] <jphase> I might have a fiddle of this, let me look
[12:06:20] <gtek1k> if my markup is <a><img><span></a>
[12:06:35] <umax> hey folks, when i "select files" (images) i can show them fast ? in a little thumbnail ? or i have to first upload it to can show to the user he is uploading
[12:06:54] <gtek1k> shouldnt this work hmm
[12:06:54] <gtek1k> 	$('img').on('load', function() {  $(this).parent().find('span').fadeOut(300); })
[12:08:35] <Velveeta> god i want to murder whoever decided to remove css expressions from IE8 because it was such an awesome browser that it just works with regular css rules
[12:10:01] <jphase> gtek1k: yeah, sounds about right without seeing the markup
[12:10:13] <umax> hey folks, when i "select files" (images) i can show them fast ? in a little thumbnail ? or i have to first upload it to can show to the user he is uploading
[12:10:21] <jphase> gtek1k: yeah, that should work - http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/rfFs4/
[12:11:14] <Velveeta> umax: i don't think there's a way to access the actual contents of that file on disk from your browser due to security restrictions, so you'd have to upload it first before you were able to display a thumbnail
[12:11:44] <jphase> gtek1k: granted, my example doesn't have the container match the size of the image before it's loaded, so pay no attention to that heh
[12:15:49] <umax> Velveeta ok, well how i can drag and move uploaded images ? is it hard to master? when i want that users can switch the position of images.
[12:15:55] <thebope> Velveeta, jphase At my company we used FileReader to tackle that issue
[12:16:17] <thebope> I'm not sure how backwards compatible it is, but it allowed us to display thumbnails prior to server upload
[12:16:28] <thebope> and we resized them to fit into our boxes and stuff
[12:16:30] <jphase> hm?
[12:17:22] <Velveet__> thebope: looks like IE doesn't support it < 10
[12:17:30] <Velveet__> but it's nice to know that there's an API for that sort of thing now
[12:18:21] <thebope> Velveet__, jphase  - http://pastebin.com/pmWcvE7P
[12:18:28] <thebope> Yea it's not the most backward compatible solution
[12:18:29] <Velveet__> umax: as far as dragging and moving uploaded images, that's completely unrelated to the transfer itself, and depending on what you're using as available front end libraries, jquery ui comes with draggable/droppable/sortable widgets to make that interaction pretty easy
[12:18:48] <thebope> Ignore all the turn to danger stuff, that's obviously another method we were using
[12:18:57] <thebope> but you should be able to get the gist of what was going on from there
[12:18:57] <Velveet__> thebope: i'm now stealing your company's IP and launching a competing firm based entirely on this snippet
[12:19:06] <thebope> lol can you get my ip from that?
[12:19:11] <jphase> I think I just got invited into a conversation I wasn't a part of initially...
[12:19:16] <Velveet__> IP as in intellectual property ;)
[12:19:30] <thebope> Oh you bastard! You've got one hour until expiration
[12:19:33] <thebope> oh sorry jphase
[12:19:44] <jphase> hehe, all good, I'm as social as the next bloke
[12:20:04] <thebope> That'd be quite the compliment for me though Velveet__ , I wrote that snippet!
[12:20:46] <thebope> umax, I paste binned my not particularly backward compatible solution to your problem above. Feel free to have a look
[12:21:02] <Velveeta> jphase: how social *is* the next bloke, exactly?
[12:21:06] <thebope> lol
[12:21:24] <Velveeta> i keep getting disconnected from moving through different segments of our wifi in the building, damnit
[12:21:53] <umax> thebope cool ty
[12:21:58] <thebope> np
[12:22:13] <jphase> well I guess that'd technically be as social as jpokorny, which isn't currently reciting much rhetoric... touché
[12:22:21] <thebope> hahaha
[12:22:58] <gtek1k> hmm jphase should I put it inside window.loaded or something?
[12:23:04] <gtek1k> its not always removing them from each image
[12:23:19] <gtek1k> plz see PM URL
[12:23:32] <jphase> gtek1k: well you can put it inside of window load, but if you do that it'd wait until all of them load and remove them all at the same time
[12:23:50] <gtek1k> if u check that link any idea why some arent working
[12:24:39] <gtek1k> hmm outside the doc ready it wasnt even working for me
[12:26:16] <gtek1k> really strange?
[12:26:28] <jphase> gtek1k: perhaps try to console.log('image #' + $(this).index() + ' loaded'); and see if you're not getting some of the load events to fire
[12:26:42] <jphase> they seem a little random on my end as well
[12:27:49] <gtek1k> hmm they all have #1
[12:28:24] <gtek1k> never seen something so quirky
[12:28:27] <gtek1k> usually works or doesnt
[12:29:29] <gtek1k> anyway I can help u help me?
[12:33:19] <gtek1k> jphase, any ideas broseph? appreciate the help..
[12:35:04] <jphase> gtek1k: one sec, almost done with this fiddle
[12:40:39] <gtek1k> thanks jphase
[12:44:48] <umax> filereader is a additional library?
[12:45:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:45:06] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[12:45:07] <umax> or its included in js autoimatickaly
[12:46:12] <duch_kazatel> umax did you look at the link I sent?
[12:46:25] <umax> y
[12:46:44] <duch_kazatel> it's not a library - it's an API that all ready exists
[12:47:05] <duch_kazatel> well, currently it's in draft.
[12:47:47] <duch_kazatel> it's not "in javascript" - it's apart of the broiwser APIs.
[12:48:34] <umax> aha ok
[12:48:54] <duch_kazatel> !caniuse filereader
[12:48:54] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: You can use FileReader API with: Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 3.6, Chrome 6, Safari 6, Opera 11.1, iOS Safari 6, and Opera Mobile 11.1. http://caniuse.com/#search=filereader
[12:50:26] <jphase> gtek1k: hmm, well it technically works in the fiddle, although I've loaded it so many times that it's all in memory for me and I couldn't really hard refresh without putting it up on one of my servers:  http://robido.com/test/imageload.html
[12:50:53] <thebope> umax, yea its not particularly backwards compatible
[12:51:11] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[12:51:29] <gtek1k> jphase, thanks a lot for trying to help man
[12:51:37] <jphase> np
[12:51:43] <gtek1k> I wonder if its my jquery version
[12:51:46] <gtek1k> or any extra scripts im using
[12:51:48] <gtek1k> so weird tho
[12:51:52] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[12:52:08] <gtek1k> duch_kazatel, u askin me?
[12:52:12] <duch_kazatel> yepo
[12:52:27] <gtek1k> if u go to http://gtekdev.com/pc/portfolio/landscapes/before-afters/
[12:52:32] <BillCriswell>  Would you say at more than... 20 checkboxes to categorize something you should switch to tagging?
[12:52:38] <gtek1k> some preloaders are not removing on load and its random
[12:52:54] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k what browser?
[12:52:55] <BillCriswell> Tagging makes so much more sense to me.
[12:53:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell 20 checkboxes is endemic of problems.
[12:53:14] <gtek1k> duch_kazatel, all
[12:53:23] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k didn't happen for me.
[12:53:31] <gtek1k> u dont see any remaining white boxes?
[12:53:40] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:53:52] <umax> i see
[12:53:54] <umax> im using chrome
[12:54:00] <umax> eee sry
[12:54:01] <jphase> I see white boxes on chrome as well
[12:54:01] <umax> firefox
[12:54:02] <umax> :D
[12:54:03] <duch_kazatel> ff and chrome are both okay.
[12:54:19] <jphase> well haphazardly
[12:54:23] <jphase> sometimes I do, sometimes I don't
[12:54:37] <gtek1k> ya duch_kazatel if u refresh / clear cache
[12:54:40] <gtek1k> it gets stuck on some
[12:54:45] <duch_kazatel> been doing that.
[12:54:51] <duch_kazatel> still not happening.
[12:56:03] <NoiseEee> for me, the first time its all white boxes.
[12:56:08] <NoiseEee> then on refresh. some
[12:56:15] <duch_kazatel> granted I'm at work with a stupid beefy internet connection, so maybe that has something to do with it?
[12:56:59] <umax> NoiseEee sup bro :) php community
[12:57:20] <BillCriswell> I love how little effort goes into a successful "unsubscribe page".
[12:57:29] <BillCriswell> It's like... 8/10 times a plain h1.
[12:57:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell or how much goes in to make it hard to use.
[12:57:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, some can be an asshole.
[12:58:12] <gtek1k> hmm jphase this is driving me nuts lol so weird
[12:58:23] <gtek1k> I am firing in the doc ready and it doesnt work outside the doc ready I wonder if thats part of it
[12:58:37] <frank_o> BillCriswell: haha
[12:58:42] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k fire before doc ready.
[12:58:55] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k aaaah i'll bet it's a race condition.
[12:58:57] <frank_o> thats so true
[12:59:01] <jphase> yeah
[12:59:12] <jphase> on my version of yours I'm using $(function() {
[12:59:27] <gtek1k> ya before doc ready not workign
[12:59:48] <duch_kazatel> i'lk bet you're loading some images before doc ready, so the event binding isn't seeing the load event complete.
[12:59:53] <frank_o> BillCriswell: ideally it should be so well made that people dont want to unsubscribe
[12:59:54] <duch_kazatel> *i'll
[13:00:25] <duch_kazatel> i haven't seen the code, gtek1k, but maybe attaching to the document and doing a delegated listener there before document ready fires will work?
[13:00:28] <gtek1k> weird it seems like its mainly the first few now
[13:00:33] <BillCriswell> frank_o: True.
[13:00:52] <jphase> gtek1k: also, enqueue your gtek.js script in the footer instead of putting it up top
[13:00:54] <BillCriswell> frank_o: A couple options on how many emails to send like... max a month is always a nice touch.
[13:01:13] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k and also add a listener to the window load event to clear any white boxes that didn't get removed initially.
[13:01:17] <frank_o> Never thought of that..
[13:01:31] <jphase> ah that's a good idea ^
[13:01:43] <Lobosque> hey guys, I'm having trouble doing an cross-domain ajax call. the details are here. any help is welcome :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616647/cors-error-with-jquery-ajax-call-when-header-is-set
[13:02:58] <decx> gtek1k why not lazyload the images and get rid of the superfluous span overlay
[13:03:32] <frank_o> Why do my images disappear on hover? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/6/embedded/result/
[13:04:02] <gtek1k> decx, what would lazy load do? the prob is cant set a height/width because they scale down % based
[13:04:26] <duch_kazatel> frank_o try again?  getting a 404 for that one.
[13:04:43] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Weird me too
[13:05:00] <duch_kazatel> frank_o don't link to the result - just the edit page :)
[13:05:24] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/V728z/6/embedded/result/
[13:05:48] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Yeah normally I would but it's essential to achieve the offset effect
[13:05:48] <duch_kazatel> frank_o that... is not what i asked for, but OK.
[13:05:57] <duch_kazatel> ah
[13:06:07] <frank_o> yep
[13:07:07] <duch_kazatel> looks like the mouse calculations are all relative.  not sure though.
[13:09:59] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Sleep on it will you :)
[13:10:48] <duch_kazatel> not my forte tbh.
[13:11:14] <duch_kazatel> someone else might be able to help though
[13:11:26] <gtek1k> duch_kazatel, is it still working perfectly for u ? http://gtekdev.com/pc/portfolio/landscapes/before-afters/
[13:11:45] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k that one is broken for me.
[13:11:51] <gtek1k> if u refresh
[13:11:54] <gtek1k> it changes
[13:11:56] <gtek1k> ?
[13:12:04] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:12:07] <duch_kazatel> that's broken.
[13:12:09] <duch_kazatel> race condition
[13:12:20] <gtek1k> so fkn weird... what is race condition? any idea how to fix maybe?
[13:12:28] <frank_o> Indeed
[13:12:34] <frank_o> Parallax scrolling is a relatively new phenomenon
[13:13:03] <duch_kazatel> frank_o i'll bet the box resizing is breaking the relative stuff it's running on init.
[13:13:06] <duch_kazatel> but that's just a guess.
[13:13:17] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k you're binding to the load event right?
[13:13:26] <duch_kazatel> on document ready, yeah?
[13:13:36] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[13:13:45] <gtek1k> if u look at top and bottom youll see both http://gtekdev.com/pc/wp-content/themes/pc/js/gtek.js
[13:14:05] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k can you answer the question?
[13:14:53] <decx> i don't get why you simulate lazyloading with an overlay
[13:14:53] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k you asked what a race condition is, so I'm trying to explain it.
[13:15:17] <decx> just have the images show up if they are in the source anyway
[13:15:26] <duch_kazatel> decx agreed.
[13:15:41] <duch_kazatel> unless he wants to avoid the "snapping" as stuff loads in.
[13:15:43] <BillCriswell> I'm going to destroy some pizza tonight.
[13:16:05] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell, eater of foods.  destroyer of GI.
[13:16:08] <decx> but it's not even masonry, all the images are the same -.-
[13:16:12] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:16:15] <BillCriswell> What's GI?
[13:16:24] <duch_kazatel> gastrointestinal
[13:16:33] <BillCriswell> Hahah damn I got it at the last second.
[13:16:51] <duch_kazatel> my wife works at a vet hospital so i get to hear things like that allll the time.
[13:17:46] <BillCriswell> Does she try to bring home a lot of animals? My girlfriend is constantly trying to trick me into new pets.
[13:19:18] <duch_kazatel> she does sometimes.  she's succeeded once but it was a pretty exceptional case.
[13:19:26] <socialblogsite> has anyone got Contact Form 7 to send the confirmations to a bootstrap modal using the extra settings of CF7?
[13:21:03] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite you might want to ask in a place dedicated to Contact Form 7.
[13:23:39] <socialblogsite> There’s no IRC, and nobody answered yet where I asked.
[13:24:21] <decx> they have their own support forum on wordpress.org
[13:24:25] <socialblogsite> and I can’t ask in wp forums because otto hates me and his minions are loyal
[13:24:38] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite just pointing ou this channel may not be of much assistance - you're asking about 2 things that aren't jquery in a room about jquery.
[13:24:43] <duch_kazatel> inb4 "bootstrap uses jquery"
[13:25:06] <BillCriswell> socialblogsite: Why does "otto" hate you?
[13:25:19] <duch_kazatel> and why is his name a palindrome?
[13:25:40] <duch_kazatel> maybe it's http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061202155743/uncyclopedia/images/c/c0/Otto_%28as_himself%29.jpg
[13:25:47] <BillCriswell> Can't trust a man whose name is a palindrome.
[13:25:52] <decx> is racecar even a real word?
[13:26:12] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:26:23] <socialblogsite> I found a bug in wp and tried to get help from non-moderators, but I couldn’t pass. No one could help me (there was a bug) and neither left my posts open for others to help. It’s a big gang and you can’t pass them to reach the actual community
[13:26:25] <Jattenalle> socialblogsite isnt a palindrome..
[13:26:26] <Jattenalle> derp
[13:26:29] <Jattenalle> i'm dumb.. nevermind!
[13:26:34] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's a step futher. You can flip that work upside down and reverse it and it's still otto... depending how low you cross your t's.
[13:26:44] <BillCriswell> flip that word*
[13:26:51] <duch_kazatel> sounds nasty, BillCriswell
[13:26:56] <BillCriswell> o++o
[13:27:22] <decx> what's that, the start of a fencing competition with daggers?
[13:27:27] <socialblogsite> we call it “capicua”
[13:27:42] <socialblogsite> 810018
[13:28:16] <socialblogsite> i just realized “capicua” sounds aborigen bolivian :P
[13:28:25] <wb_twerp> just curious if jasmine driven BDD is useful, any one does it ?
[13:28:35] <wb_twerp> or is end-to-end testing new trend ?
[13:28:36] <Jattenalle> we can go deeper.. o++o is basically 0110, and 0110 is 6.. and 6 upside down is 9.. 9 minus 6 is 3.. Half-Life 3 confirmed!
[13:29:06] <BillCriswell> It's all making sense.
[13:29:33] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: CSS to the rescue: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/V728z/12/embedded/result/
[13:29:40] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp we don't do BDD here, but we do automated end-to-end testing here
[13:30:07] <duch_kazatel> along with manual QA for higher risk things.
[13:30:31] <gtek1k> hey duch_kazatel sorry was on the phone let me review what was said
[13:32:36] <decx> 3 libs to move a div based on mouseposition frank_o ?
[13:35:06] <lando23> hey guys i think i might be misunderstanding the proper use of .position(). can you check out my fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/3KXuL/
[13:35:32] <lando23> and also probably munging .css() too.
[13:38:06] <decx> use += and you don't have to get the position first
[13:38:07] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3KXuL/3/
[13:38:14] <__joshua__> use position absolute to get left working
[13:39:14] <lando23> thanks decx! what is this += magic?!
[13:39:34] <decx> jquery wizardry
[13:39:44] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/3KXuL/4/
[13:39:54] <nervousMoose> lando: Basic operators. x += 2 is the same as saying x = x + 2
[13:40:59] <lando23> sure but decx's solution is $square.css('top', '+='+y+'px'); (which works great)
[13:40:59] <lando23> the += is a string, not an operator
[13:41:27] <decx> btw, if you move elements it's faster to save the coordinates in a separate object and change translate3d/position based on that
[13:41:31] <lando23> also a great soln joshua
[13:41:41] <decx> like here: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/
[13:41:45] <__joshua__> eh.  you should probably store position as object state, rather than in the DOM
[13:42:36] <decx> in the end dom is still crap, use canvas for anything involving wasd controls ^^
[13:42:56] <decx> well. canvas is still dom. but you know
[13:42:58] <decx> not divs
[13:44:29] <lando23> that's a helluva demo
[13:44:39] <BillCriswell> pew pew pew
[13:44:44] <StanAccy> Does jquery have anything built in to allow me to pass state/variables between independent functions?
[13:45:51] <lando23> i'm actually kind of surprised that position: absolute fixed this.
[13:45:56] <gtek1k> hey duch_kazatel you still there?
[13:46:05] <StanAccy> function(){ var isVisible = $(#id).is(:'visible');} and the be ablet o access the value of 'isVisible' later on in a different function (without using a global var)
[13:46:08] <duch_kazatel> I'm back now.
[13:46:16] <gtek1k> I am binding to the load event, what do you mean the snapping?
[13:46:19] <lando23> i thought that would have positioned the square relative to the viewport
[13:46:23] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy not without passing it explicitly.
[13:46:28] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k ignore that part :)
[13:46:43] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k your problem is you're binding to the load event after the document ready has fired.
[13:46:52] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: so no generally available Map store of anything like that
[13:46:56] <gtek1k> hmm no I moved it above it
[13:47:12] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy not without making a global object, no.
[13:47:20] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks
[13:47:29] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k then the binding will never work because the images don't exist when you bind :)
[13:47:36] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: can I make a global object via jquery?
[13:47:44] <StanAccy> or purely through normal javascript scoping?
[13:47:49] <gtek1k> it seems to work now but im running 2 functions to make it work
[13:47:51] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy it's javascript.
[13:48:03] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy but don't use globals.
[13:48:11] <gtek1k> duch_kazatel, plz see http://collabedit.com/ssmk4
[13:48:34] <StanAccy> Ive got two methods to invoke, either side of an Ajax update.  I need to grab the visibility of the element before the update, and then set the visibility back again after the update
[13:48:34] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k ugh i hate these
[13:48:42] <gtek1k> :?
[13:48:47] <StanAccy> I dont want to use a global ref
[13:48:54] <StanAccy> but that maybe my only option here
[13:49:08] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy aaaah.  global and data are your only real options afaik.
[13:49:15] <gtek1k> duch_kazatel, what do you hate?
[13:49:20] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k i'm not a fan of those collaborative code things.
[13:49:26] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: Data on an element is pretty much like a global though :-)
[13:49:29] <gtek1k> oh it was just a paste for u to see
[13:49:35] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy but better scoped ;)
[13:50:06] <gtek1k> so duch_kazatel overall it works with both scripts but I assume I should only need 1?
[13:50:22] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k could you share your code in a fiddle?
[13:50:28] <duch_kazatel> or a bin or something?
[13:51:18] <gtek1k> not very easily
[13:51:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4UU8V/1/
[13:51:47] <duch_kazatel> that's all i was asking for :)
[13:51:55] <gtek1k> oh ok lol
[13:52:11] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you're bidnign to both the window load and document ready.
[13:52:27] <duch_kazatel> there are a few things you could do.  one idea might be to use a delegated listener on $(document)
[13:52:44] <gtek1k> well in that example nothing is on doc ready
[13:52:54] <gtek1k> I have a window.load and then selector.load
[13:53:04] <gtek1k> was showing that those come b4 doc ready
[13:53:09] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k you're wrong ;)
[13:53:14] <duch_kazatel> $(function() { is the same as a document ready.
[13:53:18] <gtek1k> oh I didnt know
[13:53:48] <duch_kazatel> and now you know - and knowing is half the battle!
[13:53:54] <gtek1k> GI HOE
[13:54:06] <gtek1k> but now how do I fix this for good and move on w my life
[13:54:20] <gtek1k> I mean its working the way it is... just seems hackery vs best practices
[13:54:24] <duch_kazatel> by binding a delegated listener to the document.
[13:54:45] <gtek1k> thats like bro for time travel you just needa  flux capacitor
[13:54:46] <duch_kazatel> you might still need a cleanup on window load.
[13:54:56] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[13:55:02] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:55:11] <duch_kazatel> ^^ read this and learn about delegation
[13:55:29] <duch_kazatel> the short version: $(document).on('load', 'img', function(){});
[13:56:20] <gtek1k> is $('img').on('load', function() {}); ?
[13:56:24] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:56:31] <duch_kazatel> 2 different things.
[13:56:54] <duch_kazatel> the one you posted looks for all img elements and binds a listener to their load event - that requires that the images exist first.
[13:57:09] <duch_kazatel> mine binds a listener to document and waits for load events to bubble up the tree.
[13:57:30] <BillCriswell> What's at almost the top of hacker news is weird today.
[13:57:44] <BillCriswell> Didn't think styling half a letter was that much of a challenge?
[13:57:47] <duch_kazatel> then looks at each one and sees if the event was emitted from an IMG
[13:57:56] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I saw that today!  freaky stuff.
[13:58:45] <duch_kazatel> http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/
[13:58:46] <duch_kazatel> woah
[13:58:52] <gtek1k> hmm now not working at all duch_kazatel
[13:59:14] <BillCriswell> I love and hate people this much smarter than me.
[13:59:34] <frank_o> mo' smartness mo' problems ya know?
[13:59:35] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k is your JS being included in the <head> ?
[13:59:43] <gtek1k> footer
[13:59:48] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k that's why :)
[14:00:05] <frank_o> im happy being in the middle
[14:00:11] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k if I were you, i'd read up on delegation, race conditions, etc.
[14:00:24] <gtek1k> I put it in the header
[14:00:26] <gtek1k> same issue
[14:00:59] <duch_kazatel> are you able to visualise the actual problem?
[14:01:40] <gtek1k> not sure man
[14:01:53] <gtek1k> I dont get why it runs different every time
[14:02:10] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k because you're binding listeners after some images have all ready loaded.
[14:02:39] <duch_kazatel> because there's no listener bound yet, nothing happens with their overlay.
[14:02:41] <gtek1k> I tried your document line but it didnt work at all even in the head
[14:02:51] <BillCriswell> frank_o: I hear ya.
[14:03:09] <decx> damn duch_kazatel, that terrain is awesome, and all with 2d rect calls.
[14:03:11] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k right, which is why i suggested you read up on delegation.
[14:03:19] <duch_kazatel> decx right?!  neat stuff.
[14:03:24] <gtek1k> wish I could man im already so behind
[14:03:36] <gtek1k> is it something simple im missing or?
[14:04:19] <duch_kazatel> gtek1k i've explained it a few times.  go google it and read up.  i can't really code up a solution for you./
[14:04:40] <gtek1k> hmm
[14:04:50] <gtek1k> that link u sent doesnt show any example with $(document).on
[14:05:12] <duch_kazatel> the link i sent you was the documentation for .on(), which deals with event binding.
[14:05:25] <gtek1k> im very familiar with that tho
[14:05:31] <gtek1k> that doesnt seem to be the issue?
[14:05:53] <duch_kazatel> but you don't know what delegation is?
[14:06:01] <gtek1k> apparently not
[14:06:10] <duch_kazatel> then you're not familiar with .on() :)
[14:06:27] <gtek1k> lol so frustrating man
[14:06:42] <gtek1k> I learned best in math by looking up the answer in the back and working backwards
[14:07:01] <gtek1k> so reading this generic doc isnt helping me
[14:07:24] <gtek1k> I appreciate the help... seems like one simple thing im missing ur aware of but dont want to share :(
[14:07:55] <duch_kazatel> i really can't stand this room sometimes.  i'm leaving for a bit.
[14:08:05] <gtek1k> exactly
[14:08:26] <gtek1k> jphase, thx for the help
[14:08:30] <gtek1k> at least its working
[14:08:37] <jphase> np
[14:08:54] <gtek1k> you think its crazy how its randomly not working or it makes sense due to something im missing
[14:08:54] <BillCriswell> I keep trying to flip my phone in the air and have it land in my pocket.
[14:09:00] <BillCriswell> It hasn't happened once.
[14:13:11] <frank_o> BillCriswell: theres probably an app for that :)
[14:14:40] <BillCriswell> It would be on par with Clint Eastwood putting a gun in his holster.
[14:14:45] <BillCriswell> Ok, almost on par.
[14:15:35] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[14:15:43] <BillCriswell> Finally.
[14:15:57] <frank_o> Say that, when it comes to rap
[14:15:57] <frank_o> We got an app for that
[14:15:57] <frank_o> And for that we brag
[14:15:57] <frank_o> Also we rap, so this loot could stack
[14:15:57] <frank_o> Grippin the phat Caddilac
[14:15:59] <frank_o> With the diamond back
[14:19:34] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[14:19:42] <BillCriswell> Home time.
[14:19:55] <corpster> var selects = $("select[id*='Vehicles']");   <-- this is incorrect
[14:20:05] <corpster> how would i find a select element with id including "Vehicles"
[14:22:30] <wb_twerp> duch_kazatel: who writes e2e tests ?
[14:22:33] <wb_twerp> QA or devs ?
[14:22:48] <wb_twerp> it is hard to manage and maintain tests with htmls
[14:25:27] <Atko> ello
[14:25:30] <thebope> wb_twerp, Devs I think
[14:25:34] <krept`> good evening.
[14:25:56] <wb_twerp> it is hard to wrangle through ill-formed html
[14:26:01] <wb_twerp> and maintain it
[14:26:10] <wb_twerp> from tests perspective
[14:26:10] <krept`> i'm having an issue with this popover not hiding on first mouseleave, but when I hover over trigger again, it works fine.  http://jsfiddle.net/xP9Q8/1/
[14:26:51] <Atko> Does anyone have any idea how reddit does the DOM injection when in a comment thread you click on "reply" link and a form shows up?
[14:27:26] <Atko> they call a function like so: <a class="" href="#" onclick="return reply(something)">reply</a>
[14:37:12] <lianzinho> guys, what's wrong with this code, why it's not parsing?
[14:37:13] <lianzinho> http://jsfiddle.net/eSP87/
[14:41:55] <lianzinho> solved!
[14:41:56] <lianzinho> thanks
[14:41:58] <lianzinho> :D
[14:41:58] <lianzinho> hehehe
[15:25:15] <corpster> how can you select a select element in jquery with a certain id?
[15:25:38] <corpster> i tried $("select[id*='text']") to no avail
[15:28:06] <shoky> $('#text')
[15:29:06] <corpster> I want to select all selects with an id that containts text
[15:29:27] <corpster> $('#text') will only select any element with text as id
[15:30:11] <duch_kazatel> corpster add a class in the backend and go from there instead maybe?
[15:30:15] <duch_kazatel> those kinds of selectors are slow.
[15:30:29] <corpster> I cant add a class. because its a sharepoint webpage
[15:30:51] <corpster> I have to work with how its renders :(
[15:31:16] <corpster> ps - if there are any ops here please kick bann noci. he is spamming some porn crap
[15:31:36] <duch_kazatel> corpster report that in #freenode instead.
[15:31:52] <duch_kazatel> and you want ( "[attribute~='value']" )
[15:32:13] <corpster> but I only want to select the select elements
[15:32:23] <duch_kazatel> ... really dude?
[15:32:25] <corpster> $("[id*='text']")  <- works
[15:32:40] <corpster> but there may be 10 elements with id*=text
[15:32:42] <duch_kazatel> $("select[id~='value']")
[15:32:45] <corpster> i guess icould filter them out
[15:32:47] <corpster> after
[15:32:50] <corpster> oh really.
[15:32:53] <corpster> ill try that duch
[15:32:55] <corpster> thanks
[15:33:00] <duch_kazatel> go read up on selectors.
[15:33:21] <duch_kazatel> you can combine attribute selectors with element selectors
[15:35:21] <corpster> yeah i know you can combine them
[15:35:26] <corpster> thats why i dont understand
[15:35:38] <corpster> $([id*='value'])  <- works
[15:35:45] <corpster> it selects my select and anotehr element
[15:36:04] <corpster> but $("select[id*='value']")  <- doesnt work
[15:36:26] <__joshua__> be really careful with wildcard id matching
[15:36:38] <decx> everytime i think i start to get it i find out that i don't get it duch_kazatel. but i got a smog city simulator from it so there's that http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6wCs5/
[15:37:20] <duch_kazatel> corpster i just tried this and it worked fine: http://jsfiddle.net/Nb7dF/
[15:37:32] <shoky> corpster you sure it's got an id attribute? maybe it's name
[15:37:53] <__joshua__> only matches 1 for me, hmm
[15:37:55] <corpster> yeah its the select element that is the issue
[15:38:04] <duch_kazatel> corpster huh?
[15:38:17] <corpster> hang on ill make a jfiddle
[15:38:18] <__joshua__> oh right, div match
[15:38:48] <duch_kazatel> corpster http://jsfiddle.net/Nb7dF/1/
[15:38:59] <duch_kazatel> there is is, working with a select.
[15:39:45] <corpster> oh dman
[15:39:48] <corpster> it works in the fiddle
[15:39:51] <corpster> so its another issue
[15:39:56] <corpster> sharepoint! ARHHH
[15:40:03] * corpster looks at sky with fists in the air
[15:40:18] <duch_kazatel> is this content getting ajax'd in or anything?
[15:41:14] <corpster> actualy with fiddlde how do u know it is working?
[15:41:18] <corpster> console.log what does that do?
[15:41:23] <corpster> coz the result is just from the html isnt it?
[15:41:29] <duch_kazatel> corpster open up your console...
[15:41:43] <xniz> hi duch_kazatel . good day

[15:42:26] <duch_kazatel> hah, i actually stepped away earlier.
[15:42:35] <xniz> maybe some day I will be educated enough to give some good advice :P
[15:42:42] <xniz> or experienced rather
[15:42:57] <xniz> im actually about to draw a mock up for my client's header/banner

[15:47:05] <xniz> :P
[15:47:10] <xniz> dunno. just going to play around a bit
[15:48:39] <duch_kazatel> depends on what the site is for.

[16:05:45] <aleray> hi, how can I get a dictionnary of css attributes applied inline on an element?
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> you can't.  you could get a string of them.
[16:06:35] <duch_kazatel> and maybe parse that in an object.
[16:06:48] <duch_kazatel> *into an
[16:07:10] <aleray> duch_kazatel, what happens if the style attr value is malformed?
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> not following - what are you actually trying to do?
[16:11:53] <aleray> duch_kazatel, with $ you can do $('div').css({prop1: 'value1', prop2: 'value2'}). I would like some method I could call like $('div').css() that would return me {prop1: 'value1', prop2: 'value2'}
[16:12:31] <duch_kazatel> aleray The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
[16:14:27] <aleray> duch_kazatel, I have a backbone application that store an annotation model like this: http://dpaste.com/10BGBDW/
[16:14:59] <duch_kazatel> let me guess: you're making a wiki and letting people edity the style inline.
[16:15:04] <aleray> I have a style filed which stands for the style attribute of the rendered view element.
[16:15:04] <duch_kazatel> *edit
[16:15:10] <aleray> yes
[16:16:01] <duch_kazatel> you've been asking this same question for a while.
[16:16:54] <aleray> right I've been here before, but in the making of this system, things slightly change
[16:16:54] <duch_kazatel> your problem is that you're accepting and using potentially dirty input.  you should really reconsider your approach.
[16:17:35] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to have users input things directly like that (protip: don't do that), then you need to have some kind of validation/storage setup to handle the rest.
[16:17:57] <socialblogsite> Anyone willing to check my website and find out why two css drop downs stick expanded or not! when touched in iPhone? (something with the events I don’t understand and you probably do)
[16:18:36] <aleray> duch_kazatel, I can implement some validation, that's not so much a problem
[16:19:02] <duch_kazatel> aleray and then use that to store the object you want.
[16:21:19] <aleray> duch_kazatel, but if I implement some validation system, it is still ok to store the style attr like this, no?
[16:24:50] <duch_kazatel> aleray i really wouldn't suggest it.
[16:26:01] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you'll have to write out that string at some point, but don't store it that way.
[16:27:43] <duch_kazatel> imo that's part of why you should just give them a string to modify.
[16:28:06] <duch_kazatel> *shouldn't

[16:28:43] <duch_kazatel> CrispyClean ew
[16:28:53] <CrispyClean> lol
[16:28:53] <duch_kazatel> copy the src and set it again
[16:29:00] <duch_kazatel> to the same value
[16:29:27] <aleray> duch_kazatel, I see you point, but I want users to be able to use every bits of css they want to...
[16:29:33] <CrispyClean> hmmm what do u mean?
[16:29:34] <duch_kazatel> aleray that's a terrible idea imo.
[16:29:59] <duch_kazatel> CrispyClean is there a source attribute for the .swf file?
[16:30:18] <aleray> duch_kazatel, Why? I mean if they want to shoot in their feet why not there is no life at danger here
[16:30:41] <duch_kazatel> aleray lol your headaches i guess :)
[16:30:53] <aleray> :)
[16:31:23] <CrispyClean> @ duch_kazatel it’s more ugly than that bruh… http://bpaste.net/show/5l2ZId7uWqoMiM5qKCYf/
[16:31:25] <duch_kazatel> i'll just make sure to do things like enter this in there: "<div></div>
[16:31:30] <aleray> this is for a small group of users familiar with the basics of css.
[16:31:45] <duch_kazatel> aleray the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[16:32:42] <duch_kazatel> CrispyClean try resetting the value with the path to the swf file, or check out something like https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/
[16:42:12] <futini> is there a jquery plugin for view text as officce word continuous page or google docs?
[16:42:31] <duch_kazatel> futini wut
[16:43:36] <futini> in google docs i see a complete doc separate by pages
[16:43:42] <futini> i need something like that
[16:43:50] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[16:45:40] <duch_kazatel> because "page" is ambiguous.  understanding your end goal might be kind of nice.
[16:45:44] <futini> i have multiple paragraph  in a database and need to display like a paper
[16:46:33] <duch_kazatel> you may have to build that out by hand.
[16:47:25] <futini> yep
[17:55:49] <ipatrol> so I've scrapped the datatables interface for now, but I would like to at some point learn how to use it

[18:02:34] <jsharpminor> I have a jQueryUI dialog that contains a dynamic list. Every time an item is added to the list, the box moves to reset its position, keeping its bottom at a certain point and raising the top. I don't want this behavior; I'd rather it keep its top aligned, or not reposition itself at all.

[18:20:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah, if you set a small demo people are more likely to help haha.
[19:22:12] <BillCriswell> Holy shit.
[19:22:50] <BillCriswell> shoky: Still around? Might want to kick noci.
[19:22:55] <BillCriswell> Spamming.
[19:30:55] <shoky> o
[19:33:44] <nownot> anyone have any suggestions to export js data to excel?
[19:39:06] <__joshua__> easiest possible way?
[19:39:34] <nownot> __joshua__: me?
[19:40:18] <__joshua__> var data = mytwodimension_array.map(function(myonedimesional_array){ return myonedimesional_array.join('\t'); }).join('\n');
[19:41:57] <__joshua__> document.location = 'data:Application/octet-stream,' + encodeURIComponent(data);
[19:42:15] <__joshua__> might work
[19:42:20] <narcarsiss> Anyone got Exsperience with Isotope by Metefizzy? i need a little Assistance Converting from 1.5 to 2. I just need help on the CSS element calls i think :?
[19:42:50] <SirLagz> i have 2 $('#content').append(), and a $.each inbetwen the 2 appends. should it run them in order ? It seems to be doing the 2 appends first, and then running the $.each
[19:43:46] <__joshua__> hahaa nownot: it worked for me
[19:44:06] <nownot> __joshua__: do you mind poisting that to a gist, having it spread out just confuses me
[19:44:08] <nownot> :)
[19:45:10] <__joshua__> document.location = 'data:Application/octet-stream,' + encodeURIComponent([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]].map(function(a){ return a.join('\t');}).join('\n'));
[19:45:15] <__joshua__> sorry, one mo
[19:46:17] <narcarsiss> Here is my JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3jVRu/   And the Isotope v2 Page. For the life of me i cant work it out :? http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[19:50:05] <__joshua__> nownot: http://jsfiddle.net/45yrP/2/
[19:50:41] <__joshua__> its, um, pretty dodgy.  might want to try a plugin called downloadify
[19:51:10] <nownot> __joshua__: thats seems to create a formatted text file
[19:51:12] <__joshua__> also, you can construct a old style excel spreadsheet rather than a .tsv pretty easily
[19:51:57] <__joshua__> well you said export, and excel will import that fine.  do you need to create a xls?
[19:51:59] <xp_prg> hi all, I want to create horizontal scrollable div that lets a user choose an image to use
[19:52:07] <xp_prg> is there some cool way to do that?
[19:52:50] <nownot> __joshua__: preferred, if possible
[19:55:57] <__joshua__> nownot: https://github.com/jmaister/excellentexport
[19:57:16] <nownot> __joshua__: thanks for the link, however opening this in numbers (mac, excel equiv) gives me just the table data, not a spreedsheet.
[19:57:29] <nownot> I didnt think this was something out of the ordinary
[19:58:12] <__joshua__> going straight from browser to xls is kinda unusually.  in the past ive just used the csv/tsv trick
[19:59:06] <__joshua__> my current project exports to xlsx, but our server turns json in the excel doc
[19:59:25] <nownot> __joshua__: so you’re using a server side component to do that?
[19:59:34] <__joshua__> yes
[20:00:15] <nownot> hmm, let me see if there is a node component
[21:03:22] <joshlegs> ok, so im kinda jquery-tarded. but if i want a dialog box to appear when a certain div is present, i just do    """ $('.end-game-message').dialog() """" right ??
[21:11:27] <jphase> joshlegs: that will turn that element into a dialog yeah
[21:12:11] <joshlegs> jphase: ok thanks. i think im having other jquery issues. such a jquery n00b :'(
[21:12:20] <jphase> but more specifically if you only wanted to call the dialog call when the div is there, you'd want to do if($('.end-game-message').length) $('.end-game-message').dialog();
[21:12:37] <jphase> wouldn't need the if check though, but just for the sake of answering you literally
[21:13:07] <joshlegs> oh cool, thanks
[21:14:13] <joshlegs> so this is a really really stupid question, but i dont know what im doing wrong. jphase could you advise ? http://dpaste.com/26JF16Y/
[21:15:18] <jphase> joshlegs: a few things... never forget your doctype
[21:15:40] <jphase> secondly, just have one script tag and you don't need type="text/javascript">.
[21:16:31] <joshlegs> you mean do <script src="bla"/> ?
[21:16:40] <joshlegs> and then where would the jquery go ?
[21:17:45] <jphase> joshlegs: http://hastebin.com/acigoxerub.django
[21:18:45] <joshlegs> jphase: ok. i'll look over that and try to understand it
[21:18:48] <joshlegs> thank you
[21:19:12] <jphase> np
[21:53:07] <shree> hi
[21:53:21] <jphase> hi
[21:54:46] <shree> hey . how can i give different css to particular word in one text box , while i am entering text , Likein facebook we tag friends name in comments
[21:55:49] <jphase> shree: set the text value to a variable, find occurrences of that word, and wrap it in a span
[21:56:12] <beancurd> .keyup, if text box contains 'blah' ^
[21:56:16] <shree> jphase: ho exacly
[21:56:25] <beancurd> what jphase said.
[21:56:45] <jphase> well you can do it kinda fancy with regex, I wrote a blog post about this, one sec
[21:56:52] <shree> can you give me small example?
[21:57:05] <jphase> shree: http://robido.com/blog/jquery/jquery-regex-search-element-textcontents-and-return-matches-based-on-child-element-containing-matched-regex-string/
[21:57:17] <jphase> there's a jsfiddle link at the bottom
[21:58:14] <shree> but thats not changing css for textbox
[21:58:39] <wewillc> Good evening ladies and gentes
[21:59:27] <jphase> shree: I didn't write the blog article specifically for you in 2 seconds, no, lol... but it does what you need it to which is to match regex expressions and in my example it changes css of the matched element. You'd want to change it to wrap spans around the text in your textarea
[22:00:32] <beancurd> jphase: you mean you're not a magic jquery genie?
[22:00:33] <shree> :)
[22:00:46] <beancurd> pphhh... what do we pay you for.
[22:01:53] <shree> new in this techlonology and struggling for this
[22:02:21] <wewillc> We all struggle until we get the hang of it
[22:02:55] <shree> yeah
[22:03:13] <shree> but m realy not getting context how can i do it
[22:03:17] <jphase> shree: one sec, let me try to make it a bit more tailored to you - this is a bit more overkill
[22:03:18] <beancurd> struggle is what burns the knowledge in your head.
[22:03:32] <jphase> it was for a node.js bot I made so not really meant for the facebooky highlight thing you need
[22:04:18] <shree> beancurd:  ok..
[22:04:48] <shree> jphase:  yeah
[22:08:06] <shree> but its really interesting technology
[22:21:42] <jphase> shree: this won't work with a textarea btw, but you could probably make a content editable box instead
[22:21:57] <shree> how
[22:22:19] <jphase> sec, I'll add one to this fiddle
[22:22:39] <shree> jphase: ok.
[22:43:54] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:54:12] <shree> jphase:  u there?
[22:54:35] <jphase> shree: yeah, it's kinda tricky, trying to get rid of the issue with several infinite spans wrapping over and over
[22:56:06] <Foxhoundz> o'anime
[22:56:17] <shree> jphase:  okey ..
[23:03:36] <jphase> shree: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/QmgDL/2/
[23:03:53] <jphase> was a bit trickier than I initially expected heh
[23:05:12] <jphase> might want that in a function wrapper so you can call it on load or whatever though
[23:07:03] <jphase> shree: more like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/QmgDL/3/
[23:07:37] <jphase> now the only problem you have to figure out is to not screw with the cursor position each time it sets the span tags
[23:46:09] <JohnDoeSmith> Hello.
[23:50:10] <JohnDoeSmith> I'm having a problem, and I'd like some help is nayone here, whou cold help me a little bit?
[23:52:42] <JohnDoeSmith> This http://pastebin.com/sy2jHZii code, works only when I'm not passing any data to server (commenting data.. line). What could be a problem there? Has anyone any ideas?
[23:54:12] <Cork> JohnDoeSmith: client side i don't see any problem
[23:54:24] <Cork> JohnDoeSmith: so i would suspect the problem is server side
[23:55:21] <JohnDoeSmith> I'm suspecting it to. Still have You any ideas? I mean what may be the problem on server side?
[23:55:51] <Cork> JohnDoeSmith: close to impossible to say
[23:56:10] <Cork> JohnDoeSmith: make sure $_POST is used and it gets the data would be a good start
[23:56:21] <Cork> after that you have to check what the script does
[23:58:14] <JohnDoeSmith> Thanks. You've led me on the right track.
[23:59:13] <JohnDoeSmith> When I've accessed pegister.php directly with passing arguments, it sayd "Content Encoding Error"
[23:59:31] <Cork> JohnDoeSmith: the server might be expecting json?
