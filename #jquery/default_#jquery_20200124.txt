[12:19:51] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> hi
[12:20:02] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> help please :
[12:20:12] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why it is written :
[12:20:16] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> "Note: This is a low-level method; a more convenient .data() is also available."
[12:20:55] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why use data() insteed of  jQuery.data() ? What are the jQuery.data() avantages ?
[12:21:13] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> It's look to me that both do the same job.
[12:30:32] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> robertmaxrees hi
[12:30:46] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> robertmaxrees help please
[12:30:57] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why it is written :
[12:31:02] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> "Note: This is a low-level method; a more convenient .data() is also available."
[12:31:06] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why use data() insteed of  jQuery.data() ? What are the jQuery.data() avantages ?
[12:31:09] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> It's look to me that both do the same job.
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:31:32] <robertmaxrees> $('foo').data() is far more consistent with the rest of the jquery API.
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.data()
[12:31:52] <robertmaxrees> it's not really designed for you to use.
[12:32:15] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> it is designed for what ?
[12:32:21] <robertmaxrees> not you.
[12:32:54] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> What do you mean ?
[12:33:12] <robertmaxrees> i can't rephrase it any clearer than i have.
[12:34:05] <robertmaxrees> $('foo').data() is what you want to use.  very few people use using $.data(), partially because it's far less consistent with the rest of the API.
[12:34:08] <pavonia> Let P be the the set of people who should use it, you are not an element of P
[12:34:51] <pavonia> Where is that even documented? I can't find it
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[12:36:22] <pavonia> Ah
[12:36:39] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> Then why $.data() does exist ?
[12:37:16] <robertmaxrees> probably a combination of internal use, legacy support, and other factors.
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> why does it matter so much?
[12:37:42] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> I have read that $.data() is faster than $('foo').data()
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:37:56] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> almost 10 times faster
[12:37:59] <robertmaxrees> ignore that kind of advice.
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> in 99.9% of cases, those kinds of benchmarks are completely and totally irrelevant.
[12:39:34] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> Ok. So the only difference is that $('foo').data() is more consistent with the rest of the jquery API ?
[12:40:14] <robertmaxrees> and is far more readable.
[12:40:29] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> i agree
[12:40:42] <robertmaxrees> always strive for readability first.
[12:41:47] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> OK. There are no other differences?
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> please stop asking.
[12:42:06] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why ?
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> go read the source code if it's really that important.
[12:42:14] <robertmaxrees> because you're beating a dead horse.
[12:42:32] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> you are dead horse ?
[12:42:56] <robertmaxrees> https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/beat-a-dead-horse
[12:43:10] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> sorry i'm not english native
[12:43:53] <robertmaxrees> you keep asking and pressing the issue.  i keep giving you consistent answers.  i'm not going to suddenly say "ah well, since you asked 7 times instead of just 6, you've unlocked the secret REAL answer."
[12:44:40] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> OK. The only difference is readilibity ?
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> stop
[12:45:22] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> why don't you say, just "yes" or "no" ?
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> i've already answered you.
[12:45:49] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> if there are not other difference say "yes", if there are say "no"
[12:46:04] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> and tell me the others differences
[12:46:14] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> cause I find nothing on the nnet
[12:46:15] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> net
[12:46:27] <robertmaxrees> the only difference that matters *to you* is that it's more readable.
[12:46:43] <robertmaxrees> if it's really so important to you, please go read the source code and inform yourself.
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> i am not google.  i am not the docs :)
[12:47:01] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> everything mater
[12:47:18] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> but i'm ok why readablity is more important
[12:47:31] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> i just want the complete list of difference
[12:47:41] <robertmaxrees> then go read the source code.
[12:47:54] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> have a link ?
[12:48:15] <robertmaxrees> https://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+source+code
[12:48:27] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> it will take much more time to read the source code
[12:48:37] <robertmaxrees> it will take me time to explain it to you.
[12:48:44] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> how many ?
[12:49:43] <pavonia> Ask #jquery-dev perhaps
[12:50:05] <fergdrsfrtgyhhfd> pavonia hi. thanks
[12:56:25] <fergdrsefordpgid> connexion, issue
[12:56:28] <fergdrsefordpgid> sorry
[18:03:56] <jak2000> hi all
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:04:25] <jak2000> i have a select option, and get the value: var xIdActividad = $(this).val();     but my question is how to get the selected text?
[18:04:38] <robertmaxrees> why would you need that?
[18:05:15] <jak2000> for show on an confirm window.
[18:05:49] <jak2000> i know how to get selected text: $( "#myselect option:selected" ).text();
[18:05:54] <jak2000> but with this ?
[18:07:50] <jak2000> done: $(this).find("option:selected").text()
[18:08:16] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need the next tho :/
[18:08:36] <jak2000> why not?
[18:08:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you need the text for?
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> (I got DC'd and missed your answer if you already answered that)
[18:09:45] <jak2000> yes i do...
[18:09:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:09:57] <robertmaxrees> nvm.
[18:10:02] <robertmaxrees> just trying to be helpful.
[18:15:54] <jak2000> thanks
[18:17:32] <jak2000> i have 6 rows with 6 select options, have 1 class: clActivity     how to know if user click(o change) on first select option?
[18:17:51] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 why do you need to know if it was the first one?
[18:17:56] <robertmaxrees> can you provide some more context?
[18:19:44] <jak2000> ok i need know if is the first for ask something:
[18:19:49] <jak2000> but only in the first....
[18:19:58] <robertmaxrees> go by the select's name attr then.
[18:20:06] <robertmaxrees> or give it a class that only it has.
[18:20:55] <jak2000> id is not a way (bacause have an random id...
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> why do you only care about the "first" select?
[18:21:35] <jak2000> i think in the next, add a data-rowno=1 and  data-rowno=2 and   data-rowno=3 and so on.... and check if data- property is avalue of 1
[18:21:51] <robertmaxrees> just use the name attribute instead.
[18:22:05] <jak2000> okay and how to get name attr? with jquery?
[18:22:22] <robertmaxrees> lol why do people ask questions, get weird about giving more details, and then quibble about proposed solutions?
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i'm gonna need a fiddle;.
[18:23:01] <robertmaxrees> because without seeing what you're working with and the problem you're actually trying to solve, it's hard to know what approach to suggest.
[18:29:07] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
