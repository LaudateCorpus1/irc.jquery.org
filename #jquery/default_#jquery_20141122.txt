[00:34:32] <dw1> is there any way to get 'this' into jquery on mouseover if the element doesn't have an ID? I want to interact with the element with jq
[00:40:26] <dw1> nevermind
[00:45:22] <Mia_> Hello channel
[00:45:26] <Mia_> how can I set class using jquery
[00:45:29] <Mia_> I mean, not add class
[00:45:38] <Mia_> I directly want to erase all the classes on an element and set a class
[00:45:55] <Mia_> is there a command to "set class" directlly
[00:49:47] <Mia_> Any ideas are appredicated
[00:54:28] <jikuja> Mia_: http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ and addClass()?
[01:25:10] <Oka> Mia_: You still here?
[02:33:16] <sam__> After defining more than 25 DOM elements using single "Var", it's saying "Assigning to to undeclared variable" when I am trying to add another DOM element.
[02:33:55] <sam__> it's working if I'm using "var" again, but it's why it's showing error for single var?
[02:34:13] <sam__> we can use single var for declaring infinite elements, right?
[02:43:24] <Mia_> Oka yes I'm here
[02:43:25] <Mia_> jsut saw that
[02:44:00] <Mia_> jikuja just saw your reply as well, I can't use removeclass because I don't know what class the element has. That's why I was asking for it.
[02:44:15] <Mia_> I mean if there is any setClass
[02:44:38] <Mia_> or something along therlines to replace all the classes the element has with something else, that would do the job for me
[04:16:34] <HewloThere> Hey there guys! I was wondering if anyone could make me a Codepen or JSFiddle or something on making something like this with classes? http://ainslie.xyz/playground/jsproject/
[04:16:51] <HewloThere> The single-item accordion type thing.
[04:19:41] <HewloThere> Actually, nevermind.
[05:12:46] <Eckyecky> does anyone know how to programmatically call this script to show an image? I have a droppable element and when an image is dropped it should be served as input for this crop script

[06:09:32] <Hypfer> I'd like to download a file with jquery. the ajax call I'm using does download it  but it doesn't download it to my disk like a real download. How do I fix that?
[06:12:41] <Woet> Hypfer: why are you using ajax?
[06:13:35] <Hypfer> Woet: I don't have to use ajax. The api just needs  a post parameter and it returns a binary file. I'd like to download that like a real normal download. how do I do that?
[06:13:48] <Woet> by sending the right HTTP headers
[06:14:28] <Hypfer> Woet: its inside a page
[06:14:43] <Hypfer> I check some boxes and then it should download the appropriate files
[06:14:52] <Hypfer> without opening new tabs or stuff like that
[06:15:07] <misutowolf> Got a question for you guys.   I have a header section on my little website, and I am doing a parallax-style animation for a web development class.   Using vanilla JS, I was able to animate all four layers of a multi-background area...but I wanted to replace it with jQuery.  Is there a way to use .animate() for this?
[06:15:23] <misutowolf> (It's a <header> with a four-bg "background-image" CSS rule)
[06:15:55] <misutowolf> background-image: url('img/top_layer.png'), url('img/mid_layer.png'), url('img/back_layer.png'), url('img/stars_layer.png'); <--
[06:16:52] <Oka> misutowolf: Create a testcase of what you have so far
[06:19:17] <misutowolf> Do what?   I already have it working without jQuery, I was just hoping it might look nicer or something if I used jQuery's .animate().   The current effect is here:  http://www.shawneespace.org/~242997/final_project
[08:03:22] <Hypfer> okay, so I still have that download problem. I have an api and when I send a Post request to it it returns a binary file (video/audio/something). how can I invoke a download of it with javascript?
[08:29:08] <BluDay> Hi, I'm using jquery 2.x in a project, but I need to support IE8. Is my best option using the older 1.11.1 version, or could I actually cater for both? ie. using conditional tags for 1.11 if IE8 or lower is used, and using 2.x otherwise?
[08:31:58] <shoky> 1.11 isn't older
[08:32:35] <BluDay> well, "older" is the wrong word to use I suppose.
[08:39:06] <shoky> anyways, you can probably do that if you want, yes
[08:45:17] <sacho> I think you should just use 1.11
[09:42:20] <OnceMe> I have Q
[09:42:50] <OnceMe> How can I make some effect which on button click, "P" letter becomes higher, but with buzz around letter, and then to shring to the normal size slowly
[09:42:54] <OnceMe> any ideas or example?
[09:43:52] <decx> a buzz?
[09:44:32] <OnceMe> well
[09:44:43] <OnceMe> you are familiar with tumblr? Favorite button
[09:45:07] <OnceMe> however I dont want something like that, but similar, like when you click on button, "P" becomes larger and changes color
[09:45:15] <OnceMe> but with some kind of effect when it becames larger
[09:45:26] <OnceMe> I mean I can just set color and font size but dunno how to do it with effect
[09:48:08] <OnceMe> decs
[09:48:10] <OnceMe> decx
[09:54:28] <decx> either wrap your first letter in an element and animate with css transitions or use the :first-letter pseudo select and animate with css transitions
[09:55:34] <OnceMe> ok
[10:50:40] <wa5ted> Cri
[10:58:57] <wa5ted> OnceMe:
[10:59:02] <OnceMe> ?
[11:42:00] <jsys> Folks, I'm getting "flashes" of the original HTML value of a textfield in some circumstances, even though visually it's not the current runtime value of the field. Anyone familiar with this issue?
[12:06:19] <smo_> hi
[12:07:12] <smo_> how can i get element array with find without this damn prevObject: ... ? just the array
[12:08:03] <smo_> var list = $('.ligne0',data); -> array without prevObject
[12:29:31] <cjohnson> smo_: http://api.jquery.com/get/#get2
[12:30:57] <jsys> Hey folks, sometimes .val() for a textarea returns the initial value set in the HTML source and not the current value. Anyone experiences this?
[12:31:36] <smo_> hummm alright cjohnson thanks, last question for exemple i have a table with tr .ligne 0 and .ligne1 , if i select $('.ligne0','.ligne1') i ll have all ligne0 first then all ligne1 after.. how can i keep the table order?
[12:44:38] <Hixon10> Hi. I am get confused. I have problem with dynamically created options of select. I am solving this problem for one week. But I don't have success. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27081848/change-event-on-dynamic-select-does-not-work-in-firefox
[13:17:07] <misteri> Hello from Paris! I have this website, that is completely js based. It pulls data as its needed from the server. To make it search-engine friendly, i put some of the data in the html directly and hide id via js. So a no-js browser will see it, but js users dont. Is that the way to go? Do I really have to send tons of useless data to the js users?
[13:21:41] <misteri> i wonder if my solution is better, or to put the search-engine content in a <noscript> tag.
[14:22:06] <frank_o> Hi! I'm embedding some YouTubes with jQuery Embedly (http://embed.ly/): http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/68n1fjfo/2/ -- currently each video is a deferred object and when Embedly is done with all objects, `whenDoneArray` will resolve.
[14:22:10] <frank_o> However there's a slight delay between when `whenDoneArray` resolves, and when the new content (YouTube thumbnails etc.) actually appears on the page. So for slower connections, `whenDoneArray` will finish before everything is actually finished. Is there a way of solving this other than gambling with a `setTimeout`?
[14:26:10] <jesmith> How do I add a new column to a datatable? i want 7 fields in my ajax response, but 8 columns on the resulting table.
[14:26:32] <wa5ted> add an extra column
[14:26:53] <wa5ted> to each set of returning data add a blank field
[14:26:55] <wa5ted> jesmith: ^
[14:27:08] <jesmith> I tried adding an extra entry to my columnDefs with aTargets[0], but it just overrode the existing first one
[14:27:42] <jesmith> I tried adding a blank element to my returning array as well but still can't get a new column to show in the table
[14:28:16] <jesmith> Added the new <th>&nbsp;</th> to where I was defining the table structure as well
[14:29:05] <jesmith> The result was my original first column missing, and everything shifted a position
[14:30:09] <jesmith> Is it possible to have more columns displayed than in the incoming dataset?
[14:31:14] <wa5ted> jesmith: anyway you can replicate i na fiddle
[14:31:28] <jesmith> working on it.
[14:36:49] <jesmith> http://jsfiddle.net/e61nnqq8/
[14:37:01] <jesmith> But something in my copy/paste is goofed and even this isn't fully working
[14:37:10] <wa5ted> lol
[14:37:12] <wa5ted> find a way
[14:37:51] <wa5ted> jesmith: perhaps you didnt load a plugin
[14:38:01] <jesmith> That's what I am checking on now
[14:39:03] <wa5ted> jesmith: ping me when its ready
[14:47:36] <jesmith> wa5ted: It's still not working, but it's not obvious to me as to why
[14:48:03] <wa5ted> have you loaded the datatables plugin
[14:48:08] <wa5ted> or is that apart of juqer yui?
[14:48:11] <wa5ted> jquery ui*
[14:48:51] <wa5ted> jesmith: ^
[14:56:24] <Tomashe> Hey
[14:56:34] <Tomashe> wondering something , i created my app using jquery, i have like 100 event listerns which i think are making the app slower. wondering what would be better. even listenrs on inline javascript functions triggers?
[15:23:15] <Prometheian> Does anyone know the performance differences between using single observables for all elements on say a register form, or one observable with multiple properties in knockoutjs??
[15:23:28] <vol4ko> anyone know how to make this happen? http://jsfiddle.net/bnbtLd1w/1/
[15:23:49] <vol4ko> actually i need on every select(new value) to be changed the effect type
[15:28:32] <wa5ted> vol4ko: wait what?
[15:29:56] <vol4ko>  show: { effect: "size"...
[15:29:58] <vol4ko> ?
[15:30:01] <vol4ko> see that?
[15:30:21] <vol4ko> i want to change it on change() event when i select different option
[15:39:48] <vol4ko> not possible
[15:39:50] <vol4ko> gave up
[16:11:01] <Mia> How can I select (example) all .red class elements under all attribute=test attribute elements in jquery?
[16:12:18] <Mia> $("[attribute='test']").$(".red")  ??
[16:23:32] <Friss> $(".red[foo='bar']") should work
[16:23:48] <zelol> i want to add an element between 2 elements with jquery , i don't find the method, help me please!
[16:24:50] <Mia> Friss, thank you very much!
[16:25:00] <Mia> but I'm not trying to select the same element
[16:25:18] <Mia> the structure is like this: there is one div wit a certain attribute, and there is a child div with a pre defined class
[16:25:23] <Friss> Yeah I read that wrong $([foo='bar'] .red)
[16:25:24] <Mia> I need to reach the class
[16:25:35] <Mia> oh hm
[16:25:39] <Mia> ok makes sense :)
[16:56:09] <Mia> is there any way to modify existing css rules via javascript or jquery? (insteac of selecting elementws with certain id or class, etc)
[16:59:02] <bl4ckdu5t> Mia: yes
[16:59:07] <bl4ckdu5t> .css()
[16:59:29] <bl4ckdu5t> .css(prop,val)
[16:59:35] <Mia> bl4ckdu5t, it just lets me edit inline css
[16:59:43] <Mia> it doens't effect future instances of the class
[17:00:00] <bl4ckdu5t> oh to edit the actual stylesheet?
[17:00:13] <Mia> yeah
[17:00:44] <bl4ckdu5t> nope I don't think there's a way to do that. That's making it write to a file
[17:01:17] <Mia> well I can always append to html a <style></style>
[17:01:22] <Mia> but that's noreally editing.
[17:02:05] <bl4ckdu5t> yes that's better. I this case, why not just write the CSS directly?
[17:02:28] <bl4ckdu5t> you don't have access to the css file?
[17:02:46] <Mia> bl4ckdu5t, what do you mean
[17:03:03] <Mia> how can you write css file?
[17:04:40] <bl4ckdu5t> I mean edit the .css file with the rules you want
[17:07:28] <bl4ckdu5t> Mia: If you really need to do this then the best way to go will be to store the styles you want from JS into the cookie, then use a server side language to grab it and store in your css file
[17:12:25] <Mia> bl4ckdu5t, that's really not what I'm looking for at this point
[17:12:38] <Mia> I'm simply looking for a way to define style rules for future copies of an item
[17:17:49] <jesmith> wa5ted, I got that fiddle solved and working to match what I am trying to do
[17:17:51] <jesmith> http://jsfiddle.net/e61nnqq8/3/
[17:18:26] <wa5ted> jesmith: still getting an error
[17:18:36] <wa5ted> some sort of popup alert
[17:18:41] <wa5ted> is that suppose to happen?
[17:18:57] <jesmith> yeah, but its related to the datatable trying to show columns when the underlying data doesn't have them
[17:19:07] <jesmith> So it's at least related to what I am hoping to do.
[17:19:17] <wa5ted> i dunno let me look
[17:19:24] <wa5ted> i probably wont be able to help
[17:19:26] <wa5ted> but ill look
[17:19:29] <jesmith> Goal is to take the 2 values, and map the numeric value to 2 columns in the datatable. (checkbox, and column 1)
[17:26:04] <Demonicpagan> though as much as i am trying to get something to output what i am getting here on http://github.stelth200inc.com/test on jsfiddle, i have placed my code there. I'm trying to achieve an output of a table 3 columns wide, in each cell of those columns contain GitHub repository data (each of these within their own table).
[17:26:05] <Demonicpagan> Final output i'm looking for is something here: http://github.stelth2000inc.com/test2.html
[17:30:47] <Demonicpagan> here is the jsfiddle i've been working with: http://jsfiddle.net/q9s3nwd5/2/
[18:30:33] <toothrot> gonna take a chance here... anyone using page.js and might be able to sanity check something for me?
[18:53:55] <kinesis> hey i have a problem. some 5star Rating Widget plugin in Wordpress loads it's content after masonry does inside jQuery document.ready().. How do I beat it and load it after?
[18:54:25] <kinesis> I'm tryig to call msnry.layout() after the 5star Rating Widget loads... It makes the bottom of the grid panels overlap
[19:07:57] <kinesis> There is a Wordpress plugin JS on my site that loads these little star widgets _after_ jQuery(document).ready(function($) and it causes my masonry.js to overlap. I tried imagesLoaded but it doesn't work for these. They're immune. What event(s) code can kill this problem by launching msnry.layout()?
[19:18:01] <MetalHead77> I have a simple web site layout that would contain a user's post and other people's comments under it.
[19:18:08] <MetalHead77> http://i.imgur.com/7VzgNsb.png
[19:18:16] <MetalHead77> I plan on using jquery to receive data from the database in a JSON format via a php script. How do I go about doing this, such that I can retrieve the user's post and the comments under it, in some kind of way that where I can then bind the associated data on my html layout
[19:18:36] <MetalHead77> ?
[19:18:58] <MetalHead77> It is a mysql database
[19:20:28] <shoky> $.getJSON or $.ajax should work fine. jquery doesn't care what database you have, that's for php to handle and output the relevant json. jquery/browser only sees the json
[19:20:37] <kinesis> how do i run msnry.layout() after rating-widget loads in Wordpress.
[19:20:41] <kinesis>    ?
[19:21:14] <shoky> kinesis: that totally depends on how that plugin works and if it gives you a way to know when it's done loading its stuff, like a js callback
[19:22:05] <kinesis> Well I do know that jQuery document.ready(function() does not catch it
[19:22:05] <MetalHead77> shoky: I know $.getJSON or $.ajax will work fine. I'm asking how I would go about fetching the data so that I can then bind correctly the user posts and the associated comments on the html layout
[19:23:28] <toothrot> heh.
[19:23:44] <toothrot> those functions are how you 'fetch' the data
[19:23:56] <toothrot> your question seems extremely general/vague to me.
[19:24:03] <kinesis> Who mine?
[19:24:04] <shoky> $.getJSON('stuff.php').done(function(data) {  $('<div>').text(data.whatever).appendTo('#userPosts')  })
[19:24:22] <toothrot> kinesis, no, what shoky said seems accurate to me.
[19:24:36] <MetalHead77> shoky: You must be kidding me :|
[19:25:00] <toothrot> MetalHead77, why don't you elaborate?
[19:25:05] <shoky> jquery doesn't do data-binding, if that's what you're looking for
[19:25:15] <kinesis> What's databinding?
[19:25:19] <MetalHead77> toothrot: What would you like for me to elaborate on?
[19:26:00] <MetalHead77> shoky: You obviously did not read my question carefully
[19:26:30] <shoky> MetalHead77: true, didn't notice the image link
[19:27:05] <shoky> but, what i gave you is just a stupid example..
[19:27:30] <shoky> obviously you'd need to tailor it to how your json and dom are structured
[19:28:15] <kinesis> heres how said script embeds itself http://pastie.org/private/jcb7qmysbij7x8tkqmig
[19:29:14] <kinesis> WHat events occur beyond jQuery document.ready() ?
[19:29:24] <kinesis> I need to launch msnry.layout() after those events are complete
[19:31:22] <shoky> kinesis: try putting that inside a global function called RW_Async_Init   (exactly)
[19:31:47] <kinesis> Global meaning?
[19:31:49] <shoky> kinesis: basing that on what it says here under "Asynchronous initiation function of the Rating-Widget library":  http://rating-widget.com/documentation
[19:32:03] <kinesis> ok
[19:32:06] <shoky> kinesis: not inside any other function
[19:34:51] <kinesis> WHOa!!
[19:35:03] <shoky> :)
[19:35:06] <kinesis> Shoky you saved me frmo having to hire a developer
[19:35:17] <shoky> no, i saved you from having to read the documentation
[19:35:21] <kinesis> like a serious expert
[19:35:24] <shoky> next time read it yourself, chump :P
[19:35:47] <kinesis> Ok I'll read the docs from now on
[19:35:56] <shoky> yay, success
[19:36:21] <kinesis> Wait a minute
[19:36:24] <kinesis> THey're not there :(
[19:36:42] <shoky> docs?
[19:37:02] <kinesis> Ok
[19:42:46] <kinesis> I got it to work halfway.. There is RW.render(); and I called msnry.layout() after .. but now only half h overlap is gone
[19:44:08] <kinesis> How do I wait for RW.render() to finish
[19:44:50] <shoky> look at the docs
[19:44:54] <shoky> for render()
[19:45:09] <shoky> under "Methods of the RW object"
[19:46:25] <kinesis> so use the callback?
[19:46:49] <shoky> yep. provide your own callback
[19:48:02] <kinesis> so how does that work? put function() { .. } inside there?
[19:48:55] <kinesis> Yeah I did it :)
[19:49:05] <shoky> ;]
[19:49:28] <shoky> docs get you far
[20:12:36] <kinesis> How do I detect when a div appears and causes overflow in the parent div? I want to run msnry.layout(); when this occurs.
[20:16:25] <kinesis> When a div appears (example : "Passwords must match" in a red box.) i want to detect that and run msnry.layout(); .. Anyone?
[20:17:20] <shoky> hook onto whatever made that div appear. there's no good general way to do it
[20:18:25] <shoky> tho, seems like a weird thing to cause the layout to change..
[20:18:46] <shoky> maybe work on getting that not to affect the layout ;)
[20:19:06] <kinesis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3045852/triggering-jquery-event-when-an-element-appears-on-screen
[20:19:48] <shoky> that's talking about elements that already exist, and are scrolled into view or something
[20:51:55] <kinesis> why wont this work:  alert ($('.post, .single_post').length);
