[00:08:35] <Captain_Ramius> Hey guys. I'm a bit confused about loading jQuery functions.
[04:49:23] <MrSunshine> hey, got a slight problem using this code "$(document).on('click', $("#confirm"), function(event) {" it still matches every click on the page not only the ones on my buttons with id "confirm" is that normal ? =)
[04:51:14] <MrSunshine> ah found the problem :P the selector is just a string not a $("blah") :P
