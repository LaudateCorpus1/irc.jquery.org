[02:12:35] <GoSox> im I using this right? I have $.post( A ).fail( B ).always( C );
[02:12:51] <GoSox> oh wait nevermind i see where the problem is
[02:13:00] <GoSox> derp
[02:13:54] <GoSox> i thought .always( ) wasn't firing, but it wasn't... because the entire $.post call wasn't happening
[02:13:56] <GoSox> that'll do it :P
[03:27:41] <GoSox> ok this is wierd. The following line works great on several other scripts, but on this one page, it's definitely being run, but seems to have no affect. very strange.
[03:27:43] <GoSox> $("input[type=submit]").prop('disabled', true);
[03:36:37] <pavonia> GoSox: Does it work with extra quotes around "submit"?
[03:37:12] <GoSox> it works when it's not being instanatly undone by another line further down in the script
[03:37:26] <GoSox> there seems to be a theme with the kind of problems i have
[04:14:31] <GoSox> Ugh i just spend an hour chasing what looked like an error in my PHP somewhere, because $("form").serialize(); does not include inputs that have been 'disabled'
[04:14:38] <GoSox> things like that are so frustrating
[07:33:05] <cxeq> I have a flask loaded jinja2 block {( script|safe)}, how can I replace that with a value loaded by getJSON? (https://pastebin.com/wfi4ynWV)
[07:33:50] <cxeq> this is for a bokeh script
[07:45:20] <zenox> is indexdb stable enough to use realistically? dexie looks nice
[08:08:14] <zenox> well damn, indexdb is only temporary storage :(
[08:47:08] <shoky> *any* storage on the client is only temporary storage
[10:56:37] <graingert> cxeq: don't use <script> without src
[10:56:42] <graingert> And use fetch
[13:44:06] <zenox> anyone around? what persistence should i use? sql.js?
[15:41:18] <graingert> zenox: knex
[15:41:31] <graingert> zenox: oh you mean in the FE?
[15:45:12] <zenox> fe?
[15:46:14] <zenox> graingert, i see knex.js is based on websql - that was deprecated long ago!
[15:46:40] <graingert> zenox: uhh no
[15:46:48] <zenox> also, i'm not using node, just plain web browser
[15:47:15] <graingert> https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex
[15:47:43] <graingert> You can use knex with SQL.js
[15:48:02] <graingert> I'd just shove it all in localStorage
[15:48:15] <zenox> yeah, but i want some form of backup
[15:48:45] <graingert> graingert: backup?
[15:49:07] <zenox> localstorage is within the browser, i'd like to be able to backup
[15:49:36] <graingert> zenox: backup?
[15:49:48] <zenox> i've been looking at things like pocketjs, which wraps localstorage and looks quite nice, but no sort of backup / export available
[15:49:58] <graingert> zenox: backup?
[15:50:05] <zenox> yes, you know. backup
[15:50:11] <graingert> No I don't know
[15:50:29] <zenox> what don't you know?
[15:50:57] <graingert> I don't know about 'backup' regarding localStorage
[15:51:08] <graingert> What are you trying to achieve
[15:51:20] <zenox> reliable persistence
[15:51:32] <zenox> without being able to export the data, it isn't reliabel
[15:52:44] <graingert> zenox: export it where?
[15:53:00] <zenox> to a file
[15:53:26] <graingert> Oh users can save their local storage if they want
[15:54:40] <zenox> yep
[15:54:53] <zenox> oh, you mean that option is built in?
[16:03:49] <zenox> graingert?
[16:04:09] <graingert> zenox: yeah
[16:04:44] <graingert> zenox: localStorage is persisted to disk anyway
[16:12:14] <zenox> well that isn't what i mean - and i think you know that
[16:19:49] <graingert> zenox: I don't know what you mean
[16:19:58] <graingert> Tell me the application you're trying to build
[16:20:13] <graingert> Maybe you just want to store everything on the server?
[16:29:31] <zenox> what server/
[16:30:36] <graingert> zenox: your server?
[16:30:46] <graingert> Where you host your application
[16:35:46] <zenox> it's all locally hosted
[16:35:55] <zenox> if it wasn't, it'd be a simple api, with sqlite
[17:14:29] <graingert> zenox: oh
[17:14:37] <graingert> zenox: use electron then
[17:14:46] <graingert> And save it in a file
[18:06:25] <zenox> graingert, i don't use node
[18:10:09] <graingert> zenox: why do you mention node?
[18:13:16] <zenox> you need to nodejs to build with electron
[19:27:12] <graingert> zenox: so?
[19:37:23] <iRonth> Hello, I'm having trouble with this website: testing-ecommerce.mercadoto.com/categorias, the sidebar with the cart is overlapping with a slider at the top. Could someone help me fix it please?
[19:38:25] <francuz> Not Found
[19:38:25] <francuz> The requested URL /categorias was not found on this server.
[19:39:21] <francuz> with slash,
[19:41:06] <iRonth> Hello, I'm having trouble with this website: https://testing-ecommerce.mercadoto.com/categorias/, the sidebar with the cart is overlapping with a slider at the top. Could someone help me fix it please?
[19:41:24] <iRonth> francuz sry, now fixed url
[19:43:00] <francuz> would you like your banner to go less on the right so it doesn't overlap? or your cart so make space for it ?
[19:44:39] <francuz> or your cart to adapt to make space for it*
[19:44:53] <iRonth> Would like the cart to move down instead of overlapping
[19:45:10] <iRonth> Same as it does when it reaches the footer
[19:55:05] <francuz> the easy way would be to check for the position of your banner div #rev_slider_18_1 (let's call it A), and the top position of your cart #woocommerce_widget_cart-6(let's call it B),
[19:55:57] <francuz> if A>B, add "top=A-B" to #rev_slider_18_1
[19:56:27] <francuz> (do the check on page load and on position change),
[19:58:22] <francuz> the clean way would be to to adapt the library you're using so it consider the max of the cart as behing the banner instead of the top menu
[19:59:53] <francuz> (to do so, you search for "sns_*" in all your files and check when does it collide with "woocommerce_widget_cart-6"
[19:59:55] <francuz> )
[20:00:47] <iRonth> Im trying your first solution, but jQuery('div#rev_slider_18_1').position() always return me top:0 left:0
[20:01:51] <francuz> jQuery('div#rev_slider_18_1').offset().top + jQuery('div#rev_slider_18_1').outerHeight(true);
[20:01:59] <francuz> should give you the bottom of the element,
[20:03:55] <iRonth> that always return the same value. Will try what you said and adapt the library
[20:05:25] <francuz> it's normal it returns the same value, it the "absolute" position of the end of that div, (meaning it's the number of pixels between the top of your web page and the bottom of that div, not relatively to where you are on the page)
[20:07:04] <francuz> you have to compare "jQuery('#rev_slider_18_1').offset().top + jQuery('#rev_slider_18_1').outerHeight(true);" with "jQuery('#woocommerce_widget_cart-6').offset().top"
[20:07:35] <francuz> and add an offset so the first value is never bigger than the second,
[20:24:09] <zenox> wow and wow: https://github.com/google/lovefield
[22:09:15] <zenox> what's the $(somevar) operator called
