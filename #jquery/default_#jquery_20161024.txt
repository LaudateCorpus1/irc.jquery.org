[00:00:53] <tombin> adding it to the body is clearly the fastest option
[00:01:00] <tombin> just not axactly what i had in mind :(
[00:02:01] <arc_> idk, this seems to be working
[00:02:07] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/6zstx9gm/
[00:02:24] <arc_> the only thing i fixed was that you didn't close the center tag for column 3
[00:03:30] <tombin> yes, it looks like it does
[00:03:45] <tombin> but on my app side, when i click the add data button nothing happens
[00:04:18] <tombin> from what i'm reading its becasue the from doesn't exist at the moment that js is laoded
[00:04:27] <arc_> correct
[00:04:33] <arc_> also you are selecting by id
[00:04:57] <arc_> you need to use a delegated event listener
[00:05:06] <tombin> ok
[00:05:12] <tombin> i'll have to research that
[00:05:21] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[00:05:26] <tombin> thank you
[00:05:28] <tombin> i'll read that
[02:38:26] <stemid> I'm using $(this).find('button'); to disable a form button inside of $('form').on('submit'. but that disables all form buttons on the page. I have multiple forms, all need to submit with ajax. am I missing something? I thought using $(this) to reference the specific form being submitted would let me only disable that button while it's submitting.
[02:41:31] <Deusdeorum> stemid what is this then? target it's class or ID instead
[02:51:10] <Cork> stemid: sounds like your running $(this) in a callback from ajax or similar
[02:51:26] <Cork> there this isn't the form and the effect you see is expected
[02:51:53] <Cork> stemid: so store the form in a variable outside that callback as var self = this; and use $(self) where you're calling it right now
[02:52:08] <Cork> (also if that doesn't help make a jsfiddle.net with the code you have)
[02:53:15] <Cork> Deusdeorum: class and id has the downside of making the event handler element specific, so you have to duplicate the code for multiple forms
[02:53:38] <Cork> and the solution he uses should work so why use a workaround
[02:54:31] <Deusdeorum> Ye, that is true!
[02:56:10] <stemid> Cork: yes but I did form_button = $(this).find('button'); and then later in the ajax callback did form_button.prop('disabled', true); is that still affected by scope?
[02:56:21] <Cork> hmm
[02:56:29] <Cork> stemid: make a jsfiddle, cause that should work
[02:56:47] <stemid> ok, I must go to work now but if I come back I'll have a fiddle ready first.
[04:56:03] <benlonnqvist> quick question about jquery mobile, in a listview with autodividers, can i make the first list item "independet" like it would not be grouped with a divider on top?
[05:44:23] <robhol> so... any idea why I can't get the border color of some element? The selector is correct, but $(selector).css("border-color") just returns ""
[05:52:26] <robhol> eh, never mind. turns out you need to specify border-bottom-color, because reasons
[05:55:18] <Cork> robhol: ya, shorthands doesn't really exist so you can get those results
[05:55:27] <Cork> even better, it differs between browsers
[05:56:33] <robhol> sounds like css all right
[05:56:52] <Cork> what?
[05:58:17] <robhol> I mean, that's... well, typical
[05:59:46] <Cork> not really, it is just what you get when something isn't fully spec:ed
[07:35:10] <jquery361> What am I missing ?  --> https://jsfiddle.net/b8ee0gnu/120/
[07:40:42] <Cork> jquery361: what do you expect should happen by returning check?
[07:41:10] <Cork> jquery361: also i would recommend adding a form around the input field instead
[07:41:40] <jquery361> Cork: It should be alert box saying: checking...
[07:41:54] <Cork> by returning the function ref?
[07:42:04] <jquery361> yeah =)
[07:46:12] <decx> remove return
[07:46:13] <decx> done
[07:46:53] <jquery361> decx --> https://jsfiddle.net/b8ee0gnu/122/
[07:46:57] <jquery361> not working :/
[07:49:10] <Cork> jquery361: didn't manage to get your fiddle to work for some reason, but a copy does https://jsfiddle.net/x736vvux/
[07:49:41] <jquery361> hmm.. ok wierd
[07:49:55] <Cork> ya... can't figure out why either
[07:50:43] <Cork> might have gotten some unicode junk into the code section
[07:50:44] <jquery361> Cork: I have loaded an external jquery library.
[07:50:56] <Cork> jquery361: ya, but it is the same as i loaded
[07:51:01] <Cork> so donno why that should matter
[07:51:12] <decx> no wrap in head
[07:51:30] <decx> therefore no objects to find
[07:51:32] <Cork> AH
[07:51:32] <Cork> ya
[07:51:34] <jquery361> Cork: How can you put jquery code when you not have jquery external resources?
[07:51:44] <Cork> jquery361: check the "javascript" menu
[07:52:28] <Cork> jquery361: anyway the point is, add a form and don't look for the key in keypress
[07:52:42] <Cork> it is much cleaner and also accessible for none seeing
[07:53:01] <jquery361> yes! great =) thx
[07:53:19] <Cork> (and for a plus add a submit/search/what ever button)
[08:01:58] <BulleTime> hi
[08:02:06] <BulleTime> im using gulp to build js
[08:02:25] <BulleTime> however there are manny errors i think they dont really mather
[08:02:31] <BulleTime> for example on this project:L
[08:02:32] <BulleTime> https://github.com/malihu/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin
[08:02:41] <BulleTime> why would it be full of errors/warnings?
[08:02:58] <Cork> what are the errors?
[08:04:21] <BulleTime>  line 1473  col 22   Too many errors. (59% scanned).
[08:04:33] <BulleTime>  Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
[08:04:39] <BulleTime> errors like these ^
[08:04:40] <Cork> ...
[08:04:48] <BulleTime> or
[08:04:48] <BulleTime> Missing semicolon.
[08:04:55] <Cork> that one makes sense
[08:05:06] <Cork> but === instead of == is silly
[08:05:10] <BulleTime> how can that project be full of errors:S
[08:05:31] <BulleTime> do i misunderstand javascript?
[08:05:44] <slax0r> yes, it runs on errors
[08:05:45] <Cork> it isn't errors persay
[08:05:58] <Cork> it is just problematic uses
[08:05:59] <BulleTime> warnings?
[08:06:12] <Cork> leaving out ; on a line means minifying the script will break the script
[08:06:25] <Cork> === is sometimes better then == cause it doesn't do type convertion
[08:06:30] <Cork> it is still valid js
[08:06:44] <BulleTime> yeah indeed
[08:06:54] <Cork> so it depends on what the tool considers ok practise rather then errors
[08:07:11] <BulleTime> so any idea how to pass the warnings and compile all my js files? gulp now stops on this file,,
[08:07:13] <BulleTime> ..
[08:07:21] <Cork> never used "gulp"
[08:07:44] <BulleTime> hm eah
[08:07:58] <BulleTime> (yeah)
[08:08:32] <Cork> so it is prob a better question for there support avenue of choice
[08:08:48] <Cork> => #gulpjs
[08:09:21] <Cork> wamping while looking for the place :)
[09:08:43] <patrickk> is there a "simple" parallax plugin which can work out of the box, just need vertical scrolling on a few elements.

[13:39:17] <chipyy> $.isNumeric=== FALSE, that doesnt work right? how could i check if isnt numeric?
[14:11:31] <catbadger>  So I need to run 10 functions asynchronously. is the best way to do it with window.setTimeout with a delay of 1?
[14:11:43] <robertmaxrees> what are the 10 functions?
[14:12:10] <catbadger> reloading a bunch of contstructs
[14:12:12] <robertmaxrees> :) because depending on what you're doing, there's either a better way or you don't actually need to do it async.
[14:12:15] <robertmaxrees> so ajax?
[14:12:19] <catbadger> no
[14:12:22] <catbadger> just js
[14:12:27] <catbadger> it's too slow
[14:12:32] <catbadger> must be async
[14:12:43] <catbadger> what's the better way?
[14:12:48] <ldlework> I've been wondering the same
[14:13:07] <ldlework> I was recommended setInterval/Timeout or a buffer with requestanimationframe or even a web worker
[14:13:10] <robertmaxrees> could you more clearly define "reloading a bunch of constructs"?
[14:13:19] <ldlework> robertmaxrees: you need to highly stylize 1000 rows
[14:13:25] <catbadger> no,sorry. functions that take 3-5 seconds a piece
[14:13:27] <ldlework> and calculating the style is expxensive
[14:13:49] <catbadger> they are not ajax. it's just thick js functions
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> ldlework are you and catbadger working on the same thing?
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> and i'm trying to understand what makes them "thick" heh
[14:14:09] <ldlework> No I can just imagine work that is expensive?
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> depends on WHAT makes it expensive.
[14:14:31] <catbadger> oh
[14:14:35] <catbadger> jqgrid
[14:14:35] <robertmaxrees> if it's a lot of DOM modifications, pull them into a fragment and work on them there, then do a single replace operation.
[14:14:36] <catbadger> lol
[14:14:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of modifying the document piecemeal.
[14:14:58] <catbadger> it's clearing selected cells on many jqgrids
[14:15:06] <ldlework> That can be dangerous if the app is modifying the dom at the same time no?
[14:15:33] <ldlework> but I agree if your cost is actual dom modification that's the way to go
[14:15:56] <catbadger> Also i can't load an external script.
[14:16:04] <ldlework> but if you're working with some highly functional widget like a grid that expects its own elements to be there most of the time, then it can be 'dangerous'
[14:16:20] <catbadger> so window.setTimeout is the best way?
[14:16:23] <TECFALL> how would you return data from a Deferred/resolve? https://jsfiddle.net/wb7quz8z/
[14:16:32] <catbadger> ...
[14:16:40] <catbadger> use the callback for resolve
[14:16:45] <TECFALL> I can't access the "data" object in this case
[14:16:48] <catbadger> ...
[14:17:04] <catbadger> :/
[14:17:20] <shoky_> d.resolve(data);
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> sorry just came back.
[14:17:54] <TECFALL> shoky_ Perfedct
[14:17:59] <TECFALL> Perfect*
[14:18:00] <TECFALL> thank you
[14:18:35] <robertmaxrees> catbadger without seeing what you've got it's hard to help then (shrug) technically using settimeout doesn't make things async afaik
[14:18:56] <ldlework> Sure it does
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> proof?
[14:19:10] <catbadger> what?
[14:19:15] <catbadger> it totally does
[14:19:23] <ldlework> If he does dom work, then schedules the next change a second later, the browser will not lock up for the duration of the first change, the timeout, and the second work.
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> where can I read on that?
[14:19:28] <ldlework> ...
[14:19:35] <catbadger> just do it in console
[14:19:37] <catbadger> ;)
[14:19:42] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean it's async.
[14:19:47] <ldlework> yes it does
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> that just changes when it tries to run things.
[14:19:55] <ldlework> unless you have a broken understanding of what "asynchronous" means
[14:19:58] <ldlework> to mean "ajax" or something
[14:20:01] <ldlework> which is wrong
[14:20:09] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[14:20:14] <shoky_> the browser will lock up for the duration of the DOM change,  whether you have setTimeout or not.
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean.
[14:20:23] <shoky_> hence it ain't async
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> the dom change itself will never be async.
[14:20:37] <ldlework> the dom change of course not
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> so that's why i'm confused about where this belief that settimeout = async
[14:20:47] <ldlework> obviously the question is if doing two changes with a timeout in between is async
[14:21:00] <ldlework> which is by all definitions of asynchronous, asynchronous
[14:21:09] <ldlework> whatever the work is
[14:21:29] <robertmaxrees> sort of?  you're really just using the call stack a little differently.
[14:21:31] <ldlework> the timer's callback is by definition asynchronously performed as its invocation is driven by an event
[14:21:33] <Whiskey> why don´t just paste a fiddle?
[14:21:58] <ldlework> When you call setTimeout(..) the work specified is asynchrnously performed.
[14:22:05] <ldlework> not synchrnously perofrmed at the time of the setTimeout call
[14:22:11] <ldlework> anything else is a misunderstanding
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> except for the DOM modifications themselves.
[14:22:19] <ldlework> Yes agreed
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> those are still synchronous.
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:25] <ldlework> but that isn't the interesting issue at all
[14:22:30] <ldlework> they specifically asked
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/19626821
[14:22:36] <ldlework> how can I do lots of dom updates asynchrnously
[14:22:36] <robertmaxrees> for more info.
[14:22:55] <ldlework> Yes
[14:22:59] <robertmaxrees> great.
[14:23:00] <ldlework> And the asynchornous example
[14:23:02] <ldlework> is the one we're discussing
[14:23:07] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm bowing out.  enjoy.
[14:23:20] <ldlework> strange
[14:23:25] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: hehe
[14:23:44] <ldlework> from your own link
[14:23:46] <ldlework> setTimeout(function(){...}, 0) simply queues the code to run once the current call stack is finished executing. This can be useful for some things.
[14:23:48] <ldlework> So yes, it's asynchronous in that it breaks the synchronous flow
[14:23:50] <ldlework> did you even read it?
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[14:24:09] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: think you have batter things to do?
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey huh?
[14:24:38] <Whiskey> yeh, as you was on the way out :D or did i missunderstand you?
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> ldlework my entire argument is that the actual dom updates are still a synchronous operation and that settimeout here is a workaround for the real problem.
[14:25:13] <robertmaxrees> but something tells me folks with disagree with that, too (shrug)
[14:25:38] <ldlework> Sure, I'm just sticking up for the basic definitions of words. I agree that its not likely the best way to performantly update a hundred rows or whatever their goal is.
[14:26:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[15:25:28] <al_nz1> morning all
[15:25:57] <al_nz1> is there a easy way to see what POST data is being submiited ? (im in chrome)
[15:27:04] <janemba> hi
[15:27:36] <shoky_> al_nz1: yes, in the devtools network tab
[15:29:22] <janemba> I'm using JQuery to send JSON data but at some point the browser close the connection beacause of the huge amount of data I send. At server side I can send my JSON kilobytes by kilobytes but I don't know how to read all my kilobytes in JQuery (I use $.getJSON function)
[15:29:53] <al_nz1> shoky_: yeah I am in there...but I cant see the values submitted?
[15:30:27] <al_nz1> ohh, in headers then form data?
[15:31:17] <al_nz1> but the values are all empty
[15:33:18] <al_nz1> ok got it now
[16:28:06] <neilpdx> i think you need a POST request.
[16:28:10] <neilpdx> jquery AJAX post
[16:28:41] <neilpdx> $.post
[17:12:45] <jonez> greetings. have there been changes to jquery 3.x such that jsonp ajax requests work differently?
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#ajax
[17:13:53] <robertmaxrees> i might start there.
[17:14:06] <robertmaxrees> nothing comes to mind though.
[17:22:26] <jonez> robertmaxrees, ok, I'll look at that. would it be helpful if I posted my js?
[17:23:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd still have to read the upgrade guide.  alternatively, what's the specific issue you're having?
[17:24:45] <jonez> robertmaxrees, "SyntaxError: missing ; before statement"
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> strange. yeah, share the code.
[17:25:24] <jonez> ok hold on
[17:30:28] <jonez> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/0qwL21e8/
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> what line are yopu getting the error on?
[17:32:20] <jonez> line 1 of the result
[17:32:26] <robertmaxrees> ah-hah.
[17:32:28] <robertmaxrees> what's the result?
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> that usually means your return format is bad.
[17:32:59] <jonez> {"total":11,"unread":0,"fragment":""}
[17:33:09] <jonez> you are right, however this code was *fine* until I upgraded to jquery3
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not JSONP fwiw.
[17:33:22] <jonez> ruh roh
[17:33:37] <jonez> because the callback name is missing?
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> si
[17:33:56] <jonez> hmm
[17:34:13] <jonez> I have some new theories to explore. thanks for your help
[17:36:06] <jonez> robertmaxrees, another hint: parsererror, Error: jQuery31105664706618131188_1477344943419 was not called
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> right./
[17:36:45] <robertmaxrees> because the return value isn't valid JSON
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0qwL21e8/1/ even dropping back to version 2.x doesn't fix it.
[17:40:49] <jonez> robertmaxrees, fixed it :)
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[17:41:20] <jonez> I had changed the rewrite_rule for get-notify-count to remove the 'qsappend'.. which broke ?callback= :)
[17:41:29] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:41:33] <jonez> :)
[17:41:42] <jonez> you got me going in the right direction
[18:00:50] <janemba> I'm using JQuery to send JSON data but at some point the browser close the connection beacause of the huge amount of data I send. At server side I can send my JSON kilobytes by kilobytes but I don't know how to read all my kilobytes in JQuery (I use $.getJSON function)
[18:01:11] <robertmaxrees> how much data is it?
[18:07:23] <patrickk> yo
[18:07:36] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon

[18:08:27] <jak2000> how are you...
[18:08:32] <robertmaxrees> eeeh heh
[18:08:35] <robertmaxrees> i've been better.

[18:21:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:25:12] <cannap> Hi, this.editor.on('text-change', function () {}) how can i write this in a arrow function? i know this is not jquery relevant but how
[18:25:35] <cannap> i asked in other channel seems no one knows^^
[18:25:46] <robertmaxrees> () => {}
[18:25:51] <robertmaxrees> instead of function() {}
[18:27:13] <robertmaxrees> $('.someElement').on('event', () => console.log('foo') ); you can omit the curlies if you only have one statement.
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> $('.someElement').on('event', e => console.log(e.target) ); you can alos omit the opening parens if you have one arg.
[18:27:46] <janemba> robertmaxrees: around 400 MB
[18:27:51] <robertmaxrees> janemba WOAH
[18:28:01] <janemba> \o/
[18:28:04] <robertmaxrees> janemba what're you downloading almost half a meg for?
[18:28:14] <cannap> yea lol my ide cant do this
[18:28:15] <cannap> omg
[18:28:20] <cannap> this is why i throught its wrong
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> cannap what ide are you using?
[18:28:23] <cannap> i had this already
[18:28:24] <cannap> hx
[18:28:25] <cannap> webstorm
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it doesn't support ES6 yet - should have an update for that.  or a plugin.
[18:28:44] <cannap> https://gyazo.com/e36b96a2bf8c3ce4be0b4930f34861ef
[18:28:45] <jak2000> robertmaxrees any plugin, for load info(while load info) progress bar, or circle rotating a cirle?
[18:28:46] <cannap> it supports
[18:28:50] <cannap> very well
[18:28:53] <cannap> but this not i have no idea
[18:29:18] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i can't think of anythong off the top of my head at the moment.
[18:29:24] <janemba> robertmaxrees: thats not even important, do you know how to handle this with jquery ? some kind on loop with $.getJSON ??
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> janemba actually it's super important because loading half a meg into the browser is begging for problems.  but fine - what does looping have to do with thios?
[18:30:07] <robertmaxrees> are you returning paginated results?
[18:30:21] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could set the timeout to something super ridiculous and see if that fixes it.
[18:30:27] <janemba> robertmaxrees: I don't know I'm thinking about a solution
[18:30:39] <robertmaxrees> is the data for a search or autocomplete or something like that?
[18:30:53] <janemba> robertmaxrees: no this is just data
[18:30:57] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[18:31:24] <janemba> we are turning around...
[18:31:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to see if there's a way you can move your workload server-side, because loading half a meg of data in the browser is a terrible idea.
[18:31:52] <robertmaxrees> but you're ignoring that.
[18:31:52] <cannap> intern or other can access this big datas?
[18:32:11] <janemba> robertmaxrees: I'm not that why I ask for a solution...
[18:32:13] <cannap> cache in localstorage hahaha xD
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> so instead, i'll suggest to set your timeout to something crazy big or at the very least paginate.
[18:32:29] <cannap> web worker?
[18:32:35] <janemba> robertmaxrees: thats the only way ? I don't really like that idea
[18:32:47] <robertmaxrees> janemba are you paginating the data server-sidE?
[18:32:52] <robertmaxrees> you're not really giving us much to go with.
[18:32:54] <janemba> robertmaxrees: nop
[18:32:59] <janemba> :)
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> then without any other context, that's all i can suggest.
[18:33:08] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, move the work server-side and don't ship so much to the client.
[18:33:29] <janemba> well I don't know I have a lot of data to send
[18:33:34] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:33:35] <ISmithers> I'll ask this in here since it is a jQuery plugin - I am attempting to use a plugin called DuoTone, that takes and image and converts it to dual tone image, however am running into CORS issues, where it cannot retrieve the image from the server (on a different domain) and modify it for display.
[18:33:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:41] <ISmithers> Is there a way to whitelist a domain or, set some policy that will allow this plugin to work/
[18:34:09] <robertmaxrees> ISmithers nope - CORS is controlled by the server you're requesting from.
[18:34:14] <janemba> robertmaxrees: well ok I already have a solution but I wanted to know if we can do otherwise
[18:34:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you open up a security hole in your browser.
[18:34:29] <robertmaxrees> janemba without more info there's not much we can do to help ;)
[18:34:30] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[18:34:46] <ISmithers> robertmaxrees: I control that server, so would I need to look at modifying something on the server then?
[18:34:50] <janemba> ok but there is not so much info
[18:35:08] <robertmaxrees> janemba you could tell us why you think you need to send that data client side and what it's for ;)
[18:35:16] <ISmithers> I thought perhaps I was missing something as I can't see any other users having issues with this plugin, but surely it would almost always be modifying remote content, so curious.
[18:35:17] <robertmaxrees> ISmithers yeah - you want to enable cors for that particular resource.
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> don't just enable to wholesale for the server, but you could enable it for those images.
[18:36:14] <janemba> robertmaxrees: I understand what you mean but I'm not doing anything that displaying that data so I'm going to do some kind of paging
[18:36:14] <ISmithers> Its a CMS, so it would almost have to be server-wide (or rather instance-wide) wouldn't it?
[18:36:44] <robertmaxrees> ISmithers i'd set an apache rule or something for all images in a certain directory.
[18:36:47] <robertmaxrees> somnething like that.
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> janemba so you're not displaying the data?  why send it to the user then?
[18:37:05] <ISmithers> OK, I will need to research a little as this is on an Azure server.
[18:37:07] <ISmithers> But thanks!
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> ISmithers sure!
[18:37:37] <janemba> robertmaxrees: no I display that data nothing else
[18:37:44] <janemba> send -> receive
[18:38:08] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, paginate it.
[18:38:15] <janemba> \o
[18:38:18] <robertmaxrees> it's not really useful to show a user that much information.
[18:38:18] <janemba> \o/
[18:38:18] <rindolf> Hi all! How do I run qunit2 from node? This appears to be qunit 1.x only - https://github.com/kof/node-qunit
[18:38:45] <robertmaxrees> janemba otherwise setup some kind of search/filtering interface and have users use that.
[18:38:57] <janemba> robertmaxrees: yes I have it
[18:39:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, thne use that and have your server handle the requests, then only send back paginated results after some reasonable maximum.
[18:39:45] <janemba> robertmaxrees: ok thx
[18:42:20] <stemid_> how can I access data in the jqXHR.fail callback? is it even sensible to do so?
[18:42:53] <robertmaxrees> stemid a fail implies that the request failes, so something went wrong.
[18:43:03] <robertmaxrees> the body is available, but why would you need it?
[18:43:32] <stemid> the server script I'm calling returns 500 but also an error message in json
[18:43:38] <stemid> which I want to show to my gui users
[18:43:56] <stemid> is the data in the xhr object?
[18:44:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jqXHR.responseText
[18:44:39] <stemid> thanks
[18:44:44] <robertmaxrees> that first arg that gets passed to the failure callbacks.
[18:47:44] <hwre> whois robertmaxrees
[19:04:05] <whoisace> I apparently need to auth myself in order to talk in javascript, but is there a specific way to swap a class of a specific element that doesn't have an ID?
[19:04:14] <whoisace> In javascript
[19:10:42] <systemfault> whoisace: If you learn CSS then you can select everything without needing an ID.
[19:11:04] <systemfault> Because in JavaScript these days, we select nodes based off CSS selectors
[19:11:32] <whoisace> Well, I tried display none on the node, but I think since it's based on react - it's giving some trouble
[19:11:41] <cannap> xpath xD
[19:12:20] <systemfault> whoisace: If you're using react, you cannot just sprinkle jquery lines like that, you need to learn react.
[19:12:48] <whoisace> Well, I'm using javascript, which react is javascript no?
[19:13:50] <systemfault> Sure, but react is done in a way where _it_ manages the DOM.
[19:23:59] <whoisace> systemfault any recommended reading for react? Other than their API?
[19:26:08] <systemfault> whoisace: I just personally started using their tutorial
[19:27:01] <whoisace> The tic tac toe?
[19:27:06] <whoisace> Kk
[19:30:06] <cannap> the had some doc updates
[19:30:08] <cannap> check it
[19:30:18] <cannap> docs are always the best place to learn the basics
[19:30:26] <cannap> and later you will learn how to mix this stuff all together
[19:30:32] <cannap> and dont use jquery when you use react
[19:31:02] <cannap> react is data-driven
[20:10:19] <buddyq> hi guys, quick question I have a function that i want to run when a pag loads. It currently is triggered from a button but I want to run it without having to click a button if a condition is met. How can do that? Right now my trigger is: jQuery('.listblog_delete').click(function(){
[20:12:45] <cannap> (function() {})();
[20:31:51] <schnoodles> Anyone know of a jQuery/JavaScript library that handles table row reordering. Not a full table system though.
[21:30:43] <Cupertina> I have a small snippet of an application that displays summary information on pharmacies. For each row in the table, I would like to color code instances of the pharmacy name being "NORK PHARMACY" or "NICECARE PHARMACY" in red.
[21:30:44] <Cupertina> Here is the jsfiddle:
[21:30:52] <Cupertina> https://jsfiddle.net/LxL9jvv3/
[21:30:58] <Cupertina> Any ideas on what is the most efficient way to accomplish this?
