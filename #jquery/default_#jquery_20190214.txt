[01:08:44] <coderhut> Hello experts, though this is not specific to jquery but a general question. Should webhook be stored at a specific time? I think we can't because webhook might won't have data at that specific time.
[01:10:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:12:06] <robertmaxrees> coderhut mind giving some background on your question?
[01:12:42] <coderhut> Well I am wanting to ask about webhook vs API. API can be called at any time. But webhook is sent from server e.g Slack. So webhook can't be relied on calling it at specific time and expecting the result at that specific time.
[01:12:58] <coderhut> Am I right?
[01:13:06] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what a webhook is.
[01:13:44] <robertmaxrees> webhooks are called on an as-needed basis - applications push data when events happen.
[01:13:53] <robertmaxrees> they are a type of api.
[01:14:05] <robertmaxrees> more traditional apis are pull-based - you ask for information when needed.
[01:15:39] <coderhut> I see. For example I want to track multiple emails from sendwithus webhook that either emails are open or not. So, if I run a cron at the end of the day then will webhook respond with all the emails data?
[01:15:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not how webhooks work.
[01:16:14] <coderhut> or will webhook return data at that specific time only?
[01:16:23] <robertmaxrees> webhooks don't *return* anything.
[01:16:37] <robertmaxrees> you *send* data when an event happens.
[01:17:11] <Woet> coderhut: https://webhooks.pbworks.com/w/page/13385124/FrontPage
[01:18:23] <robertmaxrees> https://support.sendwithus.com/analytics/webhook_faq/
[01:23:18] <coderhut> sorry, to be simple. can webhook return all data if I ask for it?
[01:23:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[01:23:40] <robertmaxrees> webhooks don't return data, they push it.
[01:23:55] <coderhut> so webhook will send data only when any action will take place and it can be during any time of the day
[01:24:02] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[01:25:04] <coderhut> so we can't rely on webhook for a specific time of the day using cronjobs? or cronjob shouldn't be used with webhooks. Am I right?
[01:25:10] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[01:25:28] <robertmaxrees> because cron jobs are pulling data.  webhooks do not allow you to pull data - they push data when events happen.
[01:25:39] <robertmaxrees> well, ostensibly your cron job would pull data.
[01:26:59] <coderhut> great, so only way is to totally depends on webhook and whenever webhook push data to us, we save it in database and process it for later use?
[01:27:10] <robertmaxrees> ding ding ding
[01:28:16] <coderhut> ok, thank you a lot robertmaxrees :)
[01:28:24] <coderhut> thank you Woet too for link :)
[01:35:05] <coderhut> Hello experts, once again what is the best non jquery date selector plugin? Thank you.
[01:35:26] <robertmaxrees> head to ##javascript for that one.
[01:35:48] <coderhut> sorry, thank you.
[01:38:41] <Woet> coderhut: <input type="date">
[01:41:52] <coderhut> cool, thanks. Will try that instead.
[05:18:01] <caliel> good morning #jquery
[05:21:35] <caliel> I have a function in which, with an ajax call, I activate a bootstrap modal with a form within, then process data and then location.reload. Now, if I call the function for a single element (i.e. $.click(function(e){}), it's ok. The problem comes when I check some objects in my php code and use a data-rel to an element to activate a forced modal. Anyway, using $.each, I need to wait that every form is
[05:21:41] <caliel> completed before going on. Can you please help me? I've checked S.O. but even using promises, I can't get what I need. Thank you.
[05:35:27] <thykka> wh-whaat
[05:36:29] <thykka> i'm not following.. what are you checking in php code? What function are you calling for a single element? What are you using $.each for and why do you have to wait?
[05:36:35] <thykka> caliel
[05:36:42] <caliel> thykka: thanks, i am here.
[05:36:52] <caliel> let me wgetpaste the code, can I?
[05:37:12] <thykka> not on the channel, use a paste service or jsfiddle
[05:37:28] <caliel> of course i am pastebiing it ;)
[05:37:41] <caliel> s/pastebiing/pastebining/
[05:39:25] <caliel> https://pastebin.com/dD1SsMRx
[05:41:52] <caliel> In php code I check, for example, if credentials are expired (then I force the user to change its password), but even if some mandatory configuration (in order) is set (for example, the user HAS to insert some data...). As you can read, I force the modal not to close without having the user complete the form.
[05:45:09] <caliel> One solution would be to insert all the *[data-rel="crud_popup"] elements in reverse order, but it's too heavy (having to location.reload() each time) and not elegant at all....
[05:45:45] <thykka> why are you making ajax calls directly after the page has loaded?
[05:46:13] <thykka> i.e. the data-rel="crud-popup").each(() => ...)
[05:46:25] <thykka> what does it accomplish?
[05:46:37] <caliel> let me pastebin something else
[05:48:39] <caliel> thykka: https://pastebin.com/hS5rEcQ9
[05:49:25] <caliel> I use these "checkpoints", if they are on the page, then I need to open a modal with the form within...
[05:49:41] <thykka> ic
[05:49:54] <thykka> so you want to open them sequentially?
[05:49:58] <caliel> yes
[05:50:41] <caliel> I thought I could use some {% if %} {% elseif %} but it's not a solution, because I have to check within user roles (first) and the password check is for every role and has to come first.
[05:50:56] <caliel> (if/then would be too nested...)
[05:51:10] <thykka> you're doing the location.reload in order to make the backend render the modals again, if needed?
[05:52:01] <caliel> No. The location.reload() comes after fail (if the php call throws a 404 error) or after modal is complete (to refresh the page with results or configuration and so on...).
[05:52:25] <caliel> I.E. When the user change the password, I set the authentication token to null, so location.reload() forces the user to login with the new password.
[05:54:57] <caliel> For example, I use the crud_crupdate to load images with ajax. After loading I reload the page and I have all images there in the "index" page. That's the need for reload (and to show an alert / flash message too after the user does what it does)
[05:55:44] <caliel> If I would not reload the page, the user would see no images / no data after form submission / image loading, having to refresh page manually. Just for better performance.
[05:56:50] <caliel> thykka: in this setup, I both have the two triggers on (chekPassword and checkProfile). But I have just the last one modal/ajax to perform. (Instead of having change password first and update your profile then).
[05:59:13] <caliel> (of course, you let me think that i have to add an if statement for location.reload() if I want to open them sequentially without reloading the page... if (block_modal) location.reload()); something like this....
[05:59:58] <thykka> i was thinking of a modal queue array.. if it's length > 0, another modal needs to be processed, otherwise a reloading action can be performed
[06:00:41] <caliel> thykka: I tried using promises and when.apply, but if i add the crud_crupdate function in the array, I have the same result :(
[06:01:29] <caliel> thykka: i pastebin what I tried...
[06:01:42] <thykka> but that's not a queue, it's just an array which is processed instantly
[06:02:01] <thykka> you're firing up all the ajax calls at once, not one after another
[06:02:35] <caliel> Yes, due to ajax being asyncronous (I tried even with async: false... nothing do to!)
[06:02:53] <caliel> what's your suggestion then?
[06:03:39] <caliel> or better, how can I do what you suggest?
[06:04:41] <thykka> i'm still not entirely sure if I understand your problem, why are you making the ajax calls within an .each(), if you want to show them sequentially instead of in parallel?
[06:05:05] <caliel> thank you, let me try to explain better.
[06:05:59] <caliel> In the twig code, I check some variables / objects and create <div data-rel="crud-pupup"> instead of having <div data-rel="crud-update-password"> or <div data-rel="crud-update-profile"> and so one (it would be a mess...)
[06:06:37] <caliel> so I take EVERY div trigger in the page ($('*[data-rel="crud-popup"]))
[06:07:30] <caliel> and I need to force the user to insert data in form, one after one... i.e. change your password, insert your profile (missing), configure something, etc etc....
[06:08:18] <caliel> I could achieve this result with {% if check %}<div ....{% elsif check2 %}<div #2>{% elseif check3 %}<div #3> and reload the page after every submission.
[06:09:09] <thykka> why reload the page, why not just return an error from the php-endpoint each modal is calling?
[06:09:40] <thykka> this way you could show an error directly, without reloading anything, and also prevent the modal from closing
[06:10:00] <thykka> i.e. close the modal only if the response is 'OK', then move on to the next modal
[06:10:34] <caliel> well, as you can read, the same function (crud_crupdate) is called when the user click, for example, on its profile to change password, even if credentials is not expired
[06:10:52] <caliel> the errors are processed within the php code, btw
[06:11:16] <thykka> right, but you're targeting different endpoints via data-attributes, i don't see what that has to do with anything
[06:11:17] <caliel> i have some constraints, i.e. i check that the user does not use an old password
[06:11:33] <caliel> ok thykka maybe my pov is wrong
[06:11:48] <caliel> i can start again but this is the only thing i thought about :|
[06:12:28] <caliel> i would like not to write another function (i.e. crud_popup_crupdate) that performs the same ajax actions (modal + form processing)
[06:12:35] <aruns> Hey guys, quick question, what is the best way to differientate between a touchmove and touchstart event?
[06:13:07] <caliel> aruns: what do you mean?
[06:13:45] <caliel> thykka: I am targeting different endpoints with the same data-attribute... to avoid having multiple data-attributes to process...
[06:14:00] <aruns> As in, I'm trying to figure out how to differ between a tap and a scroll on mobile.
[06:14:01] <thykka> caliel, i don't think you need to. If the different php endpoints have a common response scheme, e.g. { status: 'OK' } or { status: 'ERR', message: 'Password too short' }, then you can simply add a clause into crud_crupdate that checks for these keys.
[06:14:19] <caliel> thykka: they have...
[06:15:08] <caliel> thykka: every php endpoints give me a new JsonResponse(null, 200) on success... and a new JsonResponse(array('form' => ....), 400) on fail (or, rarely, a new JsonResponse(null, 404)) when the entity does not exist in db.
[06:15:59] <caliel> thykka: https://pastebin.com/M4ZzLMPe
[06:16:55] <caliel> thykka: the scheme is this one for every modal-rendered form/action
[06:17:13] <thykka> right, but instead of doing $('[data-rel]').each(... crud_crudupdate(this)), you could do crud_crudupdate($('[data-rel]').eq(0))m
[06:17:37] <thykka> and in the ajax checking function, if the response is OK, you remove the modal from the dom and call that ^ again
[06:17:47] <caliel> thykka: if I have errors in the form (i.e. password is blank) the form is rendered again IN the same modal (as you can see, in .modal-body i re-render the jqXHR.responseJSON.form)
[06:18:30] <caliel> thykka: I don't understand.
[06:19:54] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ me neither
[06:20:08] <caliel> thykka: ahahahahah
[06:20:27] <thykka> idk, showing modals sequentially seems pretty trivial, even if the contents are fetched via AJAX in-between submits
[06:20:41] <caliel> I noticed <---
[06:20:59] <thykka> and the way your system is set up, looks almost complete, aside from that you said it opens all modals at once
[06:21:33] <thykka> so i'm thinking of ways to not open the modals at once, but sequentially instead, without having to reload in-between
[06:21:49] <caliel> thykka: yes, and gives me just the *last* one on the screen :D
[06:22:31] <caliel> thykka: i can avoid the reloading with an if... for example... if block_modal, don't reload... do it when *everything* is done.
[06:22:50] <thykka> am I understanding correctly, that you only have one modal container in the DOM, and you're re-using it for each different type of form?
[06:23:01] <caliel> thykka: you are right.
[06:23:26] <caliel> I have just one <div class="modal" tabindex=-1"></div> in the skeleton of every page...
[06:23:42] <caliel> s/-1\"/\"-1\"/
[06:23:50] <thykka> okay, wif(Math.random()>0.5{
[06:23:52] <thykka> oops :D
[06:23:57] <thykka> macro key strikes again
[06:23:58] <caliel> could be :P
[06:24:31] <caliel> that could be the next single from the smiths, in the album s/Bigmouth/macro key/ :P
[06:24:39] <thykka> what is [data-rel="crud-popup"] then? I initially thought they referred to the popup containers
[06:25:12] <thykka> no wait, those are in the twig template
[06:25:22] <caliel> thykka, to be honest, <div data-rel="crud-popup"> are just triggers... If they exists, fire the forced popup.... if the don't exist, do nothing....
[06:25:34] <thykka> right
[06:26:15] <caliel> I have some pages for other stuff, but I find it annoying using event filters between filters... just write some divs and check with jquery :P
[06:26:21] <thykka> once a trigger's action is complete (i.e. the user has filled and submitted the form successfully) could the trigger be removed from the DOM?
[06:27:00] <caliel> mmm maybe using its index.
[06:27:08] <thykka> also, when a form is submitted, can it change the existing triggers, or add new ones?
[06:27:39] <caliel> we can write the code to do it... I suppose just the coffee from the usb port is a miracle to achieve (for now)
[06:28:15] <caliel> thykka: for example using a data-processed=false... and change it to data-processed=true, if I got your point?
[06:28:28] <caliel> (the modal vanish after the submission, anyway...)
[06:29:06] <thykka> seems to me like you could just run crud_crupdate for only the *first* trigger found on the page. Then, if the user completes the form successfully, you remove the trigger and get an updated list of the (remaining) triggers, and now you can repeat the process for the (new) first trigger?
[06:29:13] <thykka> does that make any sense?
[06:30:05] <thykka> once there are no more triggers left, then you can reload tif(Math.random()>0.5{
[06:30:09] <thykka> fff-
[06:30:15] <caliel> yes - that one :P
[06:30:38] <caliel> ok I got your point, you mean to reference just the very first trigger
[06:30:51] <caliel> set data-processed to false
[06:31:03] <caliel> s/false/true/
[06:31:21] <thykka> right, and because you're removing processed triggers, the first trigger in the DOM is the next trigger in the process
[06:31:32] <thykka> the list shrinks until no triggers are left
[06:31:53] <caliel> a recursive function could be good
[06:32:49] <caliel> var triggers = []; $.each($("tif(Math.random()>0.5{ :P[data-processed=false]") triggers.push($(this)); process(triggers);
[06:32:58] <caliel> sorry for the joke
[06:36:20] <caliel> thykka: nothing to do, it is a neverending loop .....
[06:36:23] <caliel> just tried....
[06:36:34] <caliel> sure I am writing wrong code...
[06:38:04] <thykka> here's the basic idea https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/L2mtco6b/
[06:38:18] <thykka> you can't click buttons 2-5 until 1 has been dealt with
[06:38:56] <thykka> and there's no need for internal lists, because the selector always chooses the first matching element
[06:40:16] <caliel> well yes, it is very good
[06:40:34] <caliel> now I have to understand how to "port" this to my code
[06:41:50] <caliel> thykka: you added an event listener to event "click"...
[06:42:01] <caliel> what is the event for "just exist"?
[06:42:33] <thykka> why do you need that?
[06:43:08] <thykka> why not use the submit event or such?
[06:43:20] <caliel> before submit there's modal('show');
[06:43:31] <caliel> and modal('show') fires up just for triggers existence....
[06:44:32] <caliel> anyway, while chatting, I tried/error some code... there's a problem with my scheme... because the "submit" part of the ajax call exists only in the DOM generated by the modal... so it's kinda "not read" from the main code....
[06:44:37] <thykka> right, you remove the previous trigger and show the next modal if the previous form submit was successful. Of course the very first modal needs to be opened outside of event listeners (or in a DOMContentLoaded event or such)
[06:45:17] <caliel> ok I will try to follow your road
[06:48:17] <thykka> I hope you find an appropriate solution! I gotta do some actual work now.. I think you can also ask in ##javascript, because your question is more related to systems design/architecture, rather than jQuery itself.
[06:48:42] <thykka> (be prepared for extreme opinions tho ;)
[06:52:19] <caliel> thykka: ahahah thank you really much (btw the code doesn't work :()
[06:52:26] <caliel> thykka: thank you for your time!
[06:53:20] <caliel> thykka: just to read what I did --> https://pastebin.com/yDtXFgTt <--- ttyl thanks
[07:01:29] <caliel> good night #jquery
[07:14:28] <sine`> can I one line this:
[07:14:29] <sine`> 		var option = jQuery('<option>',{value:k, 'data-pgq':v.mod, text:v.type});
[07:14:31] <sine`> 		jQuery('#pg_models').append(option);
[07:15:47] <pavonia> You could use .appendTo()
[07:15:56] <thykka> yes, but the real question is: should you?
[07:16:34] <thykka> in almost all cases the answer is: no, you should prefer readability over brevity
[07:18:29] <thykka> but if you're code-golfing, or simply don't care because you're not getting paid enough: $('#pg_models').append($('<option>', { value: k, 'data-pgq': v.mod, text: v.type }))
[07:18:49] <sine`> hahah
[07:18:54] <sine`> code golfing
[07:18:56] <sine`> what is that
[07:19:06] <thykka> it's trying to fit code into as small space as possible
[07:19:21] <sine`> nice.
[07:19:26] <thykka> often utilizing obscure tricks/language features to accomplish that goal
[07:19:56] <thykka> https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-golf
[07:20:33] <sine`> I have another question. If i get some information from a dropdown that is set, how can I use that safely to use in another part of the code. like if a dropdown selection will then reflect on another setting
[07:21:07] <sine`> because as was pointed out, I could just edit the html in the page and then run the code that "gets" that value which i replaced with script, correct ?
[07:21:16] <thykka> correct
[07:21:23] <thykka> you should never trust the frontend
[07:21:32] <sine`> like this for instance: var modArrayIndex = jQuery('#pg_models :selected').val();
[07:21:35] <thykka> or you know.. things the user *can* touch
[07:22:04] <sine`> so how do I do it.
[07:22:10] <thykka> and the only way to safely use user input, is to sanitize it on the backend
[07:22:16] <thykka> ..where the user cannot change things
[07:22:41] <sine`> 2 dropdowns, one is a car model the second is car colors for that model.
[07:23:32] <sine`> on change of the first one I get some value from the selected, and then use that to set the second one
[07:23:49] <sine`> perhaps i could limit it to a certain amount of digits and sanitize it?
[07:25:23] <thykka> wait, so.. When the user selects an option from the first select, you're making an ajax-call to populate the next select?
[07:26:25] <sine`> no its all in the jquery code, when the first drop downis selected, on change it gets the selected index value and uses that to reference another array that matches
[07:27:37] <thykka> oh.. it doesn't matter if the user fucks up their own view. That's on them. It does matter if what they fucked with gets read and processed by the server, or if the data they entered is otherwise shown to other people
[07:27:58] <sine`> https://bpaste.net/show/e4f4c1bddff9
[07:29:30] <sine`> the only ajax im doing is a final data grab from the fields which im trying to limit to 2 digits for each field
[07:30:29] <thykka> right, those fields you want to sanitize in the back-end before processing them, as the user may send pretty much anything
[07:31:54] <sine`> so I can do like a .strip(var,2)
[07:32:00] <thykka> other than that, i don't see major problems with your code. Of course - and I think this was discussed yesterday - you could use $element.text(val) instead of string concatenation, as this will prevent hijacking the HTML, but I'm not sure if that's even a problem, as that data is only used in the front-end and not saved anywhere?
[07:32:16] <sine`> thats correct
[07:34:39] <thykka> what is testmodels? or rather, is it something a user could write into?
[07:35:24] <thykka> ..or does it come from an API, that could potentially be hijacked?
[07:39:20] <sine`> nothing is outside of the script.js
[07:40:12] <sine`> im sorry for this basic, but how do i create a simple dictionary or k,v reference
[07:40:28] <sine`> where I can var = models['modelA']
[07:40:40] <sine`> or im sorry, the value from teh key of modelA
[07:40:59] <thykka> const models = { 'modelA': 'model A data', modelB: 'model B data' }
[07:41:15] <thykka> or you could use a Map object, but eh..
[07:41:36] <sine`> but eh what ?
[07:41:42] <thykka> i wouldn't bother :D
[07:41:57] <sine`> i have some info about it from when you mentioned it before, i will learn the map thing
[07:42:41] <thykka> a Map is like an Array where any distict value can only exist once. Try to add a '5' into a Map which already has a '5' => it will only contain one '5', not two.
[07:42:53] <thykka> not sure why I even brought it up here..
[07:44:22] <thykka> ..then there's also the map iterator, which is an entirely different, but also related thing..
[07:46:30] <sine`> if you call a function does it have to before in teh code
[07:46:39] <sine`> that function needs to be higher up the page
[07:46:43] <sine`> ill test it
[07:46:46] <thykka> depends how the function was defined
[07:47:11] <sine`> inside or outside the document ready
[07:47:11] <thykka> function foo() {} <-- this can be called before it's defined
[07:47:28] <thykka> const foo = function() {} <-- this only works if called after it's assigned
[08:03:09] <sine`> ok right great. so the first one is not like an on teh fly lambda like in python as it still needs to be defined later
[08:41:31] <sine`> halp
[08:41:38] <sine`> can I do inArray with key,values
[08:41:48] <sine`> like an array_key_exists
[08:43:18] <sine`> ive found this great tool called google, you should try it
[08:43:50] <thykka> arrays don't have key-value pairs
[08:43:54] <thykka> Objects do
[08:44:22] <thykka> so what you want is yourObject.hasOwnProperty('keyName')
[08:44:45] <thykka> or.. typeof yourObject.keyName !== 'undefined'
[08:45:32] <thykka> or even some wack shit like Object.keys(yourObject).find(key => key === 'keyName')
[08:47:12] <sine`> i used 'in'
[08:47:25] <sine`> if (  $i in testimages ){
[08:47:30] <sine`> how about that for some whack shit
[08:47:42] <thykka> sine`, note that you can convert an object into an array for processing.. Object.keys(yourObj) returns an array of keys, Object.values(yourObj) returns.. an array of values, obviously, and Object.entries(yourObj) returns an array where each item is a array, where the first item is the key and the second is the value
[08:49:30] <thykka> const myObj = { foo: 3 }; myObj.foo = undefined; 'foo' in myObj ==> returns true
[08:49:41] <thykka> ^ be mindful of this tho
[08:50:00] <thykka> also, the 'in' keyword considers props in the prototype chain
[09:46:13] <wedr> Hi, something is wrong with bugs.jquery.com , the site is down.
[09:46:59] <wedr> Mostly wanted to look up reasons why this error occurs in browsers, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3551 , but the site is down and showing 502 gateway, so I don't know any alternate links.
[09:47:13] <wedr> (It's inthe comments)
[09:48:56] <wedr> forget it then. Sorry for the trouble.
[12:02:49] <sine`> thykka: you still around bro
[12:03:09] <sine`> I have changed something and I have broken it, I cant access inner array: https://bpaste.net/show/781f9bf0b7d2
[12:05:27] <sine`> I dont really know how to test out the variables like a vardump.I guess I could alert
[12:16:28] <sine`> if anyone out there is listening in... mayday mayday, im going under
[12:16:58] <sine`> my computer is being taken over by pirates.
[12:18:52] <pavonia> What errors?
[12:19:30] <pavonia> '<option' is missing a closing bracket, no?
[12:22:50] <sine`> ARRRRRR
[12:23:11] <sine`> thats it thanks
[12:23:24] <sine`> dude im using notepad++ is there some kind of way I can find these errors
[12:23:41] <sine`> like some kind of validation in the notepad? mind you its a string so its not going to be validataed...
[12:29:14] <pavonia> I'd be surprised if there were an IDE that would catch that kind of error
[12:35:06] <fr33w11y> hello?

[12:43:25] <fr33w11y> i have to use an iframe?
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> no
[12:43:54] <robertmaxrees> read the bit after the "UPDATE"
[12:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you use the FormData object.
[12:44:38] <fr33w11y> whats that?
[12:44:49] <robertmaxrees> click through to the documentation on MDN.
[12:45:26] <fr33w11y> is FormDate jquery?
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:47:25] <fr33w11y> still not clear. you mind help me out?
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects#Sending_files_using_a_FormData_object
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ this will show you how.  if you have more questions about FormData, I'd hit up ##javascript :)
[12:48:45] <fr33w11y> sure, can i ask you one more question?
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:50:22] <pavonia> You just did
[12:50:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:59:59] <robertmaxrees> i always wonder what people are doing when they ask a question like that and then disappear.
[15:54:11] <nebulae> HI all. I am trying to pass a variable to an $.each iteration like this https://pastebin.com/LZaneyne but I am getting back undefined
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> what's undefined?
[15:55:52] <nebulae> robertmaxrees: the array
[15:55:58] <robertmaxrees> nebulae you mean response[index].VARIABLE_2 ?
[15:56:05] <nebulae> yes
[15:56:19] <nebulae> can I use variables in that point
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you want to access surname there?
[15:57:05] <nebulae> yeah but I push the surnames in an array... the array holds "undefined" values
[15:57:13] <robertmaxrees> right, because you aren't "passing" anything there, nor do you need to - that var is already in that scope.
[15:57:19] <robertmaxrees> you're using the wrong notation :)
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> response[index][VARIABLE_2]
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> need to use the square brackets for it to interpret that the way you're expecting.
[15:58:06] <nebulae> sh@t..!! You ara e right
[15:58:07] <nebulae> :D
[15:58:11] <nebulae> Cheers
[15:58:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
