[00:00:13] <lilsammy> Well this is where its being used, http://1077771337.n80146.test.prositehosting.co.uk/ you may need to click the "read more" bit to get enough of a scroll, it works but not well it sort of lags and on my FF takes 5 - 10 seconds to kick in when scrolling
[00:00:26] <Cork> please make a demo
[00:01:04] <Cork> 1. it makes it likely that you detect the error yourself when you try to reproduce it
[00:01:13] <Cork> and 2. it means i can fix the code to get the code working
[00:01:19] <Cork> and makes giving a fix much simpler
[00:01:55] <Cork> if you can't then you most likely will have to wait for someone with more time to dissect the problem on your page
[00:02:58] <lilsammy> http://jsfiddle.net/pgnmxL03/
[00:03:04] <lilsammy> still same issue for me
[00:03:43] <lilsammy> wow its firing like 100's of times
[00:03:58] <lilsammy> is there any way to stop it firing while animating?
[00:04:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pgnmxL03/1/
[00:04:39] <lilsammy> oh
[00:04:51] <lilsammy> wait what did you do?
[00:04:52] <Cork> lilsammy: you can check if the height is one or the other and skip the animation if it is
[00:05:01] <Cork> every time you call animate i stop the old animation
[00:05:11] <lilsammy> ohhhhhhh
[00:05:27] <lilsammy> *slaps forehead*
[00:05:31] <lilsammy> many thanks Cork
[00:05:39] <Cork> an option is to just use the scrollTop as a value for height
[00:05:44] <Cork> and not use animate at all
[00:05:50] <Cork> that is prob a better option
[00:06:47] <lilsammy> you mean if ($(this).scrollTop() > 50 ){ ?
[00:08:07] <Cork> no more like height(245 - ($(this).scrollTop() % 130))
[00:09:19] <Cork> hmm no not what i meant
[00:10:13] <Cork> lilsammy: http://jsfiddle.net/pgnmxL03/3/
[00:10:34] <Cork> if you want you can add a upper treach hold to get it to wait for 50px before starting
[00:10:47] <lilsammy> Thats cool man
[00:10:58] <lilsammy> very cool :D
[00:12:19] <lilsammy> Thanks again Cork that helped a lot
[00:12:25] <Cork> yw
[00:13:11] <lilsammy> Cork you any experience doing a multi page website and loading it into a single page so seo still thinks theres multiple pages?
[00:13:29] <Cork> lilsammy: well not sure about the "think" part
[00:13:48] <Cork> but sure doing partial updates is quite common now days
[00:14:08] <Cork> history.pushState + ajax + partials
[00:14:13] <Cork> makes that quite easy
[00:14:31] <Cork> depending on what browsers you need to support
[00:14:35] <lilsammy> OK some reading required I think but that helps :D
[00:14:41] <Cork> you might want to use something like history.js
[00:15:17] <lilsammy> looking into it now thanks :D
[00:15:30] <rajlaksh> hi
[00:15:44] <rajlaksh> how to select mutilple class in js
[00:16:08] <rajlaksh> my class === progress-bar progress-bar-success progress-bar-striped
[00:16:20] <Cork> rajlaksh: in js or in jquery?
[00:16:24] <rajlaksh> jquery
[00:16:39] <Cork> $('.progress-bar.progress-bar-success.progress-bar-striped')
[00:16:47] <Cork> if you mean all of them needs to be on the element
[00:16:55] <rajlaksh> yeah
[00:18:07] <rajlaksh> not worked.
[00:18:46] <Cork> rajlaksh: yes that would do what you request
[00:19:04] <Cork> if it doesn't then you are doing something else then what you describe
[00:19:08] <rajlaksh> http://getbootstrap.com/components/#progress
[00:19:25] <rajlaksh> 1st one
[00:20:06] <Cork> it only has the class progress-bar
[00:21:18] <rajlaksh> class="progress-bar progress-bar-success progress-bar-striped"
[00:21:25] <Cork> not on the first element
[00:21:29] <Cork> or rather first slider
[00:21:50] <Cork> ... *progresbar
[00:21:59] <rajlaksh> can jquery select mutilple class?
[00:22:05] <Cork> the first one is <div class="progress-bar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuemax="100" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuenow="60" role="progressbar">
[00:22:26] <Cork> rajlaksh: to do what you request the selector i gave you works
[00:22:33] <Cork> but what you link is something else
[00:22:53] <Cork> the only way forward i see is for you to make a demo of your problem
[00:23:00] <rajlaksh> okay
[00:23:12] <Cork> jsfiddle.net <--
[00:23:40] <rajlaksh> yeah
[00:29:01] <rajlaksh> Cork in JsFiddle it works
[00:29:58] <rajlaksh> http://jsfiddle.net/Branden/5Lz3cx33/
[00:31:21] <rajlaksh> but in site not
[00:31:34] <rajlaksh> my jquery version problem
[00:33:25] <Cork> rajlaksh: no, class selection has been the same for ages
[00:33:39] <Cork> rajlaksh: what might happen is that you run the selector before the element exists
[00:38:10] <rajlaksh> @cork my code same as JsFiddle
[00:38:29] <rajlaksh> i pasted my code to JSFIDDLE
[00:38:53] <Cork> as the fiddle works some other code is causing the problem
[00:39:03] <Cork> is the progressbar created dynamically?
[00:40:32] <rajlaksh> jquery just put % value
[00:40:43] <rajlaksh> in progress
[00:42:15] <rajlaksh> after putting jsFiddle code it works
[00:45:36] <rajlaksh> Thanks Cork it was bootstrap.css
[00:46:19] <rajlaksh> Thank you for your code
[01:07:49] <palzie_> hey, when I check the height of a div by hovering in the Developer Tools of chrome i get height = 1497 and when I use jQuery to get its height it shows 286, hows that ?
[01:14:14] <Cork> palzie_: might be you want outerHeight?
[01:14:35] <palzie_> Cork: i tried aswell and not working, I guess it's because a lot of elements in the page are JS-loaded
[01:14:54] <palzie_> but whenever i cant manage to get $(window).load to work
[01:14:58] <palzie_> but I cant*
[01:18:34] <john-dev> s there an onMoveBrowserWindows event or something?
[01:24:05] <beck-maximilian> hey
[01:31:06] <beck-maximilian> I have a question about QUnit.http://jsfiddle.net/Akkumulator/m647n6cv/1/ I want to test my "kind of AMD" implementation, but the code on line 16,17 is executes before the QUnit test. Why is this?
[01:38:01] <Maximilian> any idea?
[02:25:32] <jakey> hello
[02:40:45] <Kartagis> why am I getting undefined is not a function in the line $('#input').val($('#ta'.val())) ? the code is at http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/umyL5sm3/1/
[02:41:58] <decx> didnt you make that same mistake yesterday?
[02:42:07] <decx> ellipsis
[02:42:39] <Kartagis> decx: I probably did, I tend to make mistakes when I'm first learning something
[02:44:05] <Kartagis> og
[02:44:10] <Kartagis> I got it
[02:45:06] <Kartagis> misplacement of )
[03:01:23] <lilsammy> Ahh can anyone please help me struggling badly with using .load
[03:02:18] <lilsammy> I have jquery looping through 5 links and it loads each link to a div I have called "contentplaceholder" and I am trying to insert this above the div after its loaded but I can't seem to get it working right
[03:03:08] <lilsammy> complete mess now with all the different things I have been trying : http://pastebin.com/uEftjpNz
[03:07:55] <sahbeewah> lilsammy: what are you observing
[03:09:00] <lilsammy> well its cloning the whole placeholder div and I want the child really as the placeholder needs to be reused 5 times
[03:14:32] <sahbeewah> it’s not obvious what you’re trying to do without any html, post a fiddle if you want help
[03:14:58] <sahbeewah> although i suspect your problem lies within the .load() method, and assuming it’s synchronous when it isn’t
[03:25:32] <lilsammy> Thanks saheewah ajax seems to be working a lot better
[03:28:23] <mooncup> I have an event that triggers on the clicking of a table row
[03:28:29] <mooncup> I've added a button into that row that can be clicked
[03:28:38] <mooncup> however the event for the table row gets triggered by clicking on the button
[03:28:47] <mooncup> stopPropogation() seems to have no effect
[03:36:21] <gryyy> mooncup: Can you create a jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem?
[03:36:21] <sahbeewah> mooncup: show your code
[03:36:44] <mooncup> hm I could try to replicate it on jsfiddle I guess
[03:36:45] <mooncup> gimme a mo
[03:40:18] <mooncup> well I've created the fiddle but the tr event isn't firing at all
[03:41:26] <mooncup> well I've got it to run on jsfiddle but I can't replicate the problem
[03:41:34] <mooncup> http://jsfiddle.net/z6qfw517/
[03:47:07] <Kartagis> mooncup: is there a specific reason you are using th instead of td?
[03:47:30] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z6qfw517/1/
[03:47:54] <mooncup> nope, that's a good spot
[03:48:12] <mooncup> wait
[03:48:19] <mooncup> the th are for the headers are they not?
[03:48:31] <mooncup> oh nm
[03:48:32] <mooncup> you're right
[03:48:34] <mooncup> lemme change that
[03:50:05] <mooncup> but yeah the original on my site basically has location.href = $(this).attr('href');
[03:50:17] <mooncup> so when you click on a row you get redirected to the url
[03:50:26] <mooncup> however when the button is clicked the tr event is getting triggered too
[03:54:48] <lilsammy> is it possible to use a variable which is a dom object and use it as the thing to "insertbefore" ?
[03:55:53] <caraconan> Hi there. Using JQuery Mobile, how can I do the whole <div> a link to another page? Thanks
[04:13:01] <OnceMe> Hello, recently I switched from 1.6.0 to the latest 1.11.1 version of jqeury and I have [roblem with this code: http://pastebin.com/eEYTpbGJ Apperently when I write down username and switch to another field, checking... goes in forever, why?
[04:14:10] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe ewww
[04:14:12] <Cork> "checking"?
[04:17:44] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe you're attaching the ajaxComplete after the ajax is complete
[04:17:44] <BinaryKitten> so it never really actually fires or does the stuff
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> heh what to do then/
[04:17:44] <Cork> ?down api.jquery.com
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> it worked on 1.6.0 jquery version
[04:17:44] <BinaryKitten> give me a moment.. editing
[04:17:44] <Cork> yay...
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> You don't have to edit
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> I wish to learn it by myself what is wrong
[04:17:44] <BinaryKitten> Cork ?
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> I just need pointers :D
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> or edit it and tell me what was wrong
[04:17:44] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe remove the ajaxComplete and do the bits directly
[04:17:44] <b-ot> Cork: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://api.jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[04:17:44] <OnceMe> hmm still loading forever
[04:17:44] <decx> works for me
[04:19:50] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe http://pastebin.com/TTt1Nc02
[04:20:57] <OnceMe> it worked! o.0
[04:21:17] <BinaryKitten> i've cleaned up the usage
[04:21:32] <BinaryKitten> so that it doesn't hit the dom more than needs
[04:21:52] <BinaryKitten> the only thing i'd change on top is line 14
[04:22:01] <OnceMe> one more question
[04:22:05] <BinaryKitten> i'd change that to a js object {'username': usr}
[04:22:12] <BinaryKitten> but that's just me
[04:22:17] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe sure - fire away
[04:22:24] <OnceMe> I have one sign up form on index page, and when I hit Sign Up it redirects to this form /signup page, and change is not triggered.
[04:22:47] <OnceMe> like username is not checked if is valid or it already exists
[04:22:57] <OnceMe> should I change .change to .hover() or something?
[04:23:04] <BinaryKitten> hook the submit of the form
[04:23:17] <OnceMe> how?
[04:23:18] <BinaryKitten> check the validation of the form at that point and prevent default
[04:23:40] <OnceMe> I don't get it
[04:24:01] <BinaryKitten> $('formSelector').on('submit', function(event) { if (thingNotValid) { event.preventDefault(); return false; } });
[04:24:20] <OnceMe> yes but I had to write a code for a sign up form on index page too
[04:24:27] <OnceMe> All I want is like twitter did it
[04:24:40] <BinaryKitten> write the selector so that it hooks right
[04:24:55] <BinaryKitten> eg form[data-signup]
[04:25:10] <BinaryKitten> where you put the attribute "data-signup" on those forms
[04:29:50] <OnceMe> sorry?
[04:32:57] <arschmitz> cork: hi
[04:33:11] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:is delegate supported in 1.11.1?
[04:33:17] <OnceMe> because my tipsy is not working

[04:39:55] * Kartagis sings "I'm going slightly mad" over and over
[04:39:56] <OnceMe> nvm I solved it
[04:40:13] <OnceMe> using .on, however how can I make sure that tipsy object is destroyed?
[04:48:39] <fila> anyone can check my code and let me know how you should refactore this code for best practics http://jsfiddle.net/8j2dg2wk/ , it should help me to learn
[04:54:55] <anli> How do I get a certain form value without accessing inputs?
[04:55:27] <rgman> anli: Do you mean serialize a form?
[04:55:52] <anli> Well, I want to know which value a certain form value would get if the form was posted
[04:56:13] <anli> So maybe serializing the form is what I want to do
[04:56:27] <anli> Although I doubt it
[04:57:02] <anli> I want to know which value the form variable "foo" would get if the form was submitted, so to say
[04:57:13] <anli> Regardless of the type of element(s) that has the name "foo"
[04:57:38] <rgman> anli: Serialize will return the encoded data that a form will send in case of being submitted.
[04:58:13] <rgman> In your case, you'll just have to access that input.
[04:58:22] <rgman> Why is that a problem?
[04:58:50] <anli> There is no problem, just that I do not want to access the input(s)
[04:58:56] <anli> (There may be multiple)
[04:59:04] <anli> So how is the serialization done?
[04:59:33] <rgman> $('form').serialize();
[04:59:47] <anli> And then I have to parse the resulting string then?
[05:00:56] <rgman> Yes. But I still think it's better to just access de input.
[05:01:00] <anli> Would be nice to only have half the serialization, I do not need the string
[05:01:18] <anli> Yes, but not accessing the input was a question criteria
[05:01:18] <rgman> You could use .each() if you have multiple inputs.
[05:01:40] <anli> Yes, but I will not use .each() if jquery already did it
[05:05:00] <Kartagis> how do I specify 'all input fields excluding this id'?
[05:05:16] <anli> :not(#theid)
[05:05:33] <anli> well, "input:not(#theid)"
[05:05:50] <anli> I think that would be correct
[05:05:59] <Kartagis> anli: what about 'id containing this string'?
[05:06:18] <Kartagis> anli: sorry if I'm pushing too hard
[05:06:34] <anli> Hm, I think it is input:not(id~'foo') or something
[05:07:01] <anli> *= instead of ~
[05:07:21] <anli> Oh, wait, maybe it was ~
[05:09:02] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[05:13:46] <Kartagis> jQuery('#edit-field-opening-date-und-0-value-month').change(function() { console.log(this); }) why is this giving me Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function? I tried with this.val() as well
[05:14:55] <MacroMan> Is there any reason fadeOut() would call it's complete function immediately rather than waiting for the fadeOut to finish?
[05:15:13] <MacroMan> I would do a fiddle, but this is rather complex
[05:17:07] <MacroMan> Ah. My selector was capturing other elements already hidden. This was causing the completion immediately as well as when the visible one finished.
[05:38:44] <fabianomarechal> a good day guys
[05:39:12] <fabianomarechal> i'm from Brazil... a beautiful country
[05:39:32] <fabianomarechal> & learning jquery.
[05:40:07] <fabianomarechal> i hope make friends here.
[05:41:06] <Kartagis> is it you or Brazil that's learning jquery? :D
[05:41:42] * anli wonders if selecting all elements not having an id that contains a certain substring is a hack
[05:41:51] <anli> Could be
[05:43:31] <dewp> hey guys. i imported jquery mobile but after all i only need the $.mobile.loading(); stuff
[05:44:04] <dewp> i tried to extract it from the .js but no success. i'm not that advanced so i think i made something important wrong.
[05:44:05] <Kartagis> anli: you could want to listen for keyup on textfields, but change on datepickers
[05:44:20] <Kartagis> those both are input
[05:44:35] <anli> anli as in anli?
[05:44:43] <dewp> the extraction of the css worked perfectly. now i want to reduce the size of jquery-mobile just to the loader widget
[05:46:52] <Kartagis> anli: what else?
[05:47:07] <decx> dewp do yourself a favour and stop now, "extracting" parts from a lib will only end in disaster
[05:47:22] <Kartagis> how do I refer to options of a select? this.val() doesn't cut it
[05:47:34] <anli> Kartagis: I do not know what you are answering, thats why I wondere :)
[05:47:35] <anli> +d
[05:47:50] <Kartagis> [15:41:43] anli wonders if selecting all elements not having an id that contains a certain substring is a hack
[05:48:03] <anli> selecting as in having a jquery selector
[05:48:28] <Kartagis> anli: dropdown
[05:48:52] <dewp> decx, hmmm :)
[05:48:54] <gumble> can I somehow check if there is already some code bound to a specific action? e.g. if I click this button, if there is any javascript being executed?
[05:49:15] <decx> selecting based on not having an id, substringed or not is a terrible practise
[05:51:08] <Kartagis> cool, .selectedIndex
[06:04:19] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/01a3vtec/ <--- why isn't this working properly even though alert(this.selectedIndex) works?
[06:06:00] <anli> Isnt there still a :radio selector?
[06:07:07] <decx> why dont you use this.value there
[06:07:52] <Kartagis> decx: it shows [object HTML Element] or something like that?
[06:07:58] <Kartagis> s/\?//
[06:08:23] <decx> also you'r doublewrapping typeOfDuty needlessly
[06:09:01] <Kartagis> doublewrap? what's that
[06:09:04] <Kartagis> ?
[06:09:20] <decx> it's already a jquery object and yet you wrap typeOfDuty in another one
[06:09:39] <BinaryKitten> Kartagis .. also selectedIndex != value
[06:10:15] <Kartagis> BinaryKitten: alert(this.selectedIndex) gives me the value
[06:10:23] <decx> no it gives you the index
[06:10:27] <BinaryKitten> no, it gives you the index
[06:10:30] <decx> first option is 0
[06:10:32] <decx> second 1
[06:10:42] <decx> it's just by sheer luck that those are your values too
[06:10:45] <BinaryKitten> the value is separate, just happens to be lucky that they have similar values
[06:10:57] <decx> o/ kitten
[06:10:57] <Kartagis> decx: I'm not sure I follow by doublewrap
[06:11:17] <decx> var blah = $('#id')
[06:11:21] <Kartagis> decx: sorry, I mean option
[06:11:30] <Kartagis> not the actual value
[06:11:35] <BinaryKitten> Kartagis: var typeOfDuty = jQuery('#blah');  jQuery(typeOfDuty)
[06:12:33] <Kartagis> BinaryKitten: isn't that what I'm doing? I'm confused. are you telling me it's a no-no?
[06:12:41] <decx> it's pointless
[06:12:44] <BinaryKitten> var selectedValue = this.options[this.selectedIndex];
[06:12:53] <BinaryKitten> also to get the value without calling jQuery
[06:13:28] <decx> why not this.value kitten?
[06:13:43] <BinaryKitten> doesn't always get what people want
[06:13:57] <Kartagis> this.value gives [object HTML Element]
[06:14:05] <Kartagis> at least to me
[06:15:38] <BinaryKitten> and not object HTMLOptionElement?
[06:16:09] <Kartagis> or something like that, let me check
[06:16:19] <decx> this.options[this.selectedIndex] would be that, but never this.value
[06:17:49] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/01a3vtec/1/
[06:18:08] <BinaryKitten> Kartagis, as dec says, use this.value
[06:18:09] <Kartagis> right, it also gives me the index
[06:18:28] <decx> didnt even clean up the double wrap, i am dissappoint
[06:18:54] <BinaryKitten> decx - lol small steps
[06:18:59] <decx> ^^
[06:19:24] <decx> i still dont understand what that form is even accomplishing by putting the value in the field
[06:19:26] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/01a3vtec/2/
[06:19:32] <BinaryKitten> nor I
[06:21:51] <BinaryKitten> and there, http://jsfiddle.net/01a3vtec/4/
[06:22:12] <decx> now you're just showing off
[06:22:24] <BinaryKitten> well, might as well
[06:23:51] <lilsammy> can jquery get the last part of a url? somthing.com/this-part/ ?
[06:23:58] <damiano> hello everybody
[06:23:59] <decx> javascript can
[06:24:36] <BinaryKitten> document.location.pathname
[06:24:42] <lilsammy> I used "url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('/') +1);" but I think its getting the very last / and it should get the other bit
[06:24:53] <lilsammy> oh thanks will try that
[06:24:56] <damiano> i loop an a list of checkboxes doing:         $("input[id^='PricelistServices']:checked").each(function(i){ .... }      now my goal is to remove       "input[id^='PricelistServices']:checked"      and create a sort of array that i can loop with .each directly...how can i do that? i need to create a JSON string ?
[06:24:58] <BinaryKitten> lilsammy use document.location.pathname :D
[06:25:09] <lilsammy> no thats going to
[06:25:14] <lilsammy> for the url of the page
[06:25:20] <lilsammy> I am using hrefs of links
[06:25:44] <BinaryKitten> you did say url :p
[06:26:01] <decx> you can use $.map damiano
[06:26:23] <lilsammy> yeah sorry should of said url was set by the links .href
[06:26:42] <decx> hrefs have pathname too
[06:26:46] <damiano> $.map never used...i have to read what it does
[06:26:47] <damiano> thanks
[06:26:55] <lilsammy> oh ....
[06:27:23] <lilsammy> hows that used though?
[06:27:27] <BinaryKitten> as long as you don't get the attribute value
[06:27:54] <damiano> decx, thanks
[06:28:36] <lilsammy> var url = $(this).attr("href"); var part = url.path; doesn't work
[06:28:54] <decx> this.pathname
[06:29:20] <decx> when in doubt, console.log(this) and look at all those juicy easy to reach properties
[06:29:22] <decx> nomnomnom
[06:37:52] <droid909> guys, which event used in input type text to fire up when i enter single letter?
[06:38:16] <decx> input
[06:38:23] <droid909> input event?
[06:38:27] <droid909> no such event
[06:38:54] <decx> totally is
[06:39:00] <droid909> realy?
[06:39:02] <droid909> ok
[06:39:05] <droid909> let me try
[06:39:21] <xertion> extit
[06:40:37] <droid909> decx: thanks
[06:44:27] <goosfraba> hi guys, i have some text i try to change color on when i click them, it works good but if i click text 1, and then text 2, text 1 still has it color changed, i would like to only be able to select one at a time, how to do this?
[06:44:55] <goosfraba> i change the text with .css()
[06:46:23] <BillCriswell> ...
[06:46:36] <BinaryKitten> goosfraba pastebin or jsfiddle
[06:46:52] <decx> $(this).css() not $(myselector).css()
[06:48:47] <goosfraba> BinaryKitten: http://pastebin.com/AsGU2CMh
[06:48:57] <goosfraba> line 21 is where im stuck
[06:50:47] <BinaryKitten> are you sure this.link is what you think it is
[06:50:55] <BinaryKitten> debug it.. use console.log
[06:51:07] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:
[06:51:12] <BinaryKitten> uhuh?
[06:51:45] <OnceMe> using .on, however how can I make sure that tipsy object is destroyed?
[06:51:58] <fila> anyone can check my code and let me know how you should refactore this code for best practics http://jsfiddle.net/8j2dg2wk/ , it should help me to learn
[06:52:01] <BinaryKitten> ?
[06:52:17] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe sorry i don't follow
[06:52:33] <OnceMe> ok can we go back to
[06:52:33] <goosfraba> BinaryKitten: without this.link, it cant find the office im clicking at
[06:52:36] <OnceMe> form to form problem
[06:53:12] <decx> fila do all your dom lookups outside of the scroll, put the scroll event on window and not document
[06:53:15] <BinaryKitten> goosfraba check all your preconceptions.. i can't debug your code unfortunately as the example is too small
[06:53:36] <fila> decx: thanks a lot
[06:53:54] <decx> the closest lookups in your condition should be cached too
[06:54:04] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe can you pastebin you code? i'm lost as to the connection
[06:54:05] <decx> scrolling happens all the time and these dom lookups are pretty slow
[06:54:33] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:http://pastebin.com/TTt1Nc02
[06:54:40] <OnceMe> now that code works for /signup
[06:54:42] <fila> decx: i understand now, thanks a lot
[06:54:55] <OnceMe> however I have the same form on index page, but without js assigned.
[06:55:31] <OnceMe> so when I resubmit, text is there on /signup form, however not checked.
[06:55:35] <OnceMe> none of the functions are called.
[06:58:36] <BinaryKitten> urm..
[06:58:43] <BinaryKitten> didn't we change the code from that..
[06:58:53] <BinaryKitten> also if you want to check submission,
[06:58:57] <BinaryKitten> use submit
[06:59:15] <BinaryKitten> because the change event isn't going to fire if it's not changed
[06:59:23] <OnceMe> we didnt
[06:59:27] <OnceMe> this is your written code
[06:59:37] <BinaryKitten> urm that's not
[06:59:44] <OnceMe> ok what ot change to?
[07:00:20] <BinaryKitten> oh wait
[07:00:29] <BinaryKitten> sorry, got my pastes mixed up
[07:00:58] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe you need to hok the submit event on the form
[07:01:05] <BinaryKitten> then check the value there
[07:01:18] <BinaryKitten> aditionally, you should be checking this on the serverside and validate
[07:01:42] <OnceMe> yes I do
[07:01:57] <OnceMe> as you can see im calling via ajax php script
[07:02:15] <veleiro8> whats the best way to determine if a string is letters, or numbers?  My input is a date and they can use the 3 letter month name or the integer, but it all comes as type string because its input type text
[07:02:29] <Pinkamena_D> having a problem here I cant figure out. I use the ajax function to get data and then do a callback. The callback consists of a for loop which makes some elements with the data, and then calls another function.
[07:03:03] <Pinkamena_D> the second function is always being called before the for loop (verified with log statemants) even though the function call is after the for loop
[07:03:11] <Pinkamena_D> what gives?
[07:05:19] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/aFPcMje.png
[07:05:57] <decx> we're not psychic, share code
[07:07:14] <sc_> i am, infact, psychic
[07:07:28] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:any progress?
[07:07:36] <decx> oh yeah, well homy many fingers am i holding up
[07:07:41] <sc_> none
[07:07:57] <decx> shit that's right i was indeed typing and not holding fingers up
[07:08:03] <sc_> :D
[07:08:15] <decx> ok Pinkamena_D all questions will be answered by sc_
[07:08:20] <Pinkamena_D> https://bpaste.net/show/cd4509cead2b
[07:08:51] <Pinkamena_D> sendJS just uses the $.ajax call
[07:09:54] <Pinkamena_D> that part at the bottom "callback()" (which I have a console.log statement at the top of) prints out before the "loop" log statements I have there
[07:10:42] <Pinkamena_D> if I move the "callback()" call into the for loop, it works correctly but then calls the function many times of course
[07:11:08] <Pinkamena_D> this feels like it could be a syntax bracket missing somewhere but I have loped and I can not find anything wrong
[07:11:51] <droid909> decx: for some reason is i have .mask('999-999-999') on my input type text field, event 'input' doesn't work
[07:11:54] <droid909> decx: why?
[07:11:58] <droid909> is =if
[07:12:10] <droid909> it is not fireing up
[07:12:25] <BinaryKitten> .mask?
[07:12:29] <decx> maybe the mask plugin is shit
[07:12:49] <BinaryKitten> it's probably returning false or preventing default
[07:13:22] <shoky_> Pinkamena_D: how are you calling this function? (createInstanceGraphs)
[07:16:19] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:any progress?
[07:19:29] <droid909> decx: jquery maskedinput plugin ...
[07:29:21] <droid909> decx: maybe i could use another event?
[07:29:29] <ruby_on_tails> how can i get the position of an element if it were float left?
[07:29:30] <droid909> decx: keyup or something?
[07:29:48] <droid909> ruby_on_tails: what kind of position?
[07:29:53] <ruby_on_tails> basically i want to apply float left to an element, get its .position() but the element shouldnt move i just want the position if it was floated left
[07:30:06] <droid909> hmm
[07:30:11] <ruby_on_tails> in other words i want some values from an element if it had some specific css properties
[07:30:24] <ruby_on_tails> but i dont want the element to change
[07:30:36] <ruby_on_tails> so apply css, get value, revert css, but no rendering
[07:30:42] <ruby_on_tails> something like that possible?
[07:31:39] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten:how to bind event to submit form?
[07:34:34] <droid909> decx: keyup seems to work
[07:34:37] <droid909> decx: thanks
[07:38:41] <decx> i didnt do anything?
[07:38:57] <decx> solving problems afk, stepping up my irc game !
[07:38:58] <BillCriswell> Thank you decx.
[07:39:33] <decx> thank you for being a decx, travel down the road and back again ♬
[07:42:27] <BillCriswell> Thank you for being a friend.
[07:44:08] <BinaryKitten> OnceMe $('formSelector').on('submit', function(event) { if (thingNotValid) { event.preventDefault(); return false; } });
[07:48:18] <Kingsy> can someone think of a way of doing an "animation" on a number, so it literally just randomly changes itself forever UNTIL you stop it ?
[07:48:29] <Kingsy> but you need to be able to process something else int he backghround
[07:49:06] <decx> what like this clock? ng up my irc game !
[07:49:06] <decx> [16:38:54] < BillCriswell> Thank you decx.
[07:49:06] <decx> [16:39:28] <decx> thank you for being a dec
[07:49:11] <decx> http://jackf.net/bezier-clock/
[07:49:15] <decx> this clock
[07:49:24] <decx> damnit i duch_kazatel'ed the paste
[07:49:33] <BillCriswell> Hahahaha
[07:49:57] <BillCriswell> decx: This looks fun. I should really read up on this bezier curve business.
[07:50:28] <Kingsy> wow thats cool
[07:50:49] <Kingsy> like this --> http://aishek.github.io/jquery-animateNumber/ <--
[07:51:12] <decx> it's just a timer
[07:51:23] <Kingsy> but it would be nice to say $("someElement").animateNumber();    .. do something else   ...    $("someElement").animateNumber("stop");
[07:51:32] <Kingsy> like a ajax loader
[07:51:52] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: That's just counting though, this is transforming? numbers.
[07:52:01] <Kingsy> ah yeah
[07:52:07] <BillCriswell> Transforming representations of numbers...
[07:52:10] <BillCriswell> I think.
[07:52:16] <BillCriswell> It's getting a little complicated for me.
[07:52:17] <Kingsy> I just need sommething to randomly generate numbers.. I don't care what the numbers are
[07:52:23] <Kingsy> no need to "transform"
[07:52:32] <Kingsy> just a random number generator
[07:52:34] <decx> what like a matrix effect?
[07:52:51] <Kingsy> no, it would overwrite itself
[07:53:06] <Kingsy> so there is a span with contents 0
[07:53:10] <Kingsy> "0"
[07:53:27] <Kingsy> you cli9ck a button which is going to see how many "posts" fall under the category you just clicked.
[07:53:45] <Kingsy> when the page is loading the number changes from "0" and "spins" randomly changes from number to number really fast.
[07:54:08] <decx> like i wrote, it's just a timer
[07:54:14] <Kingsy> when the page has loaded (using ajax) you grab the real number, stop it randomly changing and set the real number in its place.
[07:54:28] <Kingsy> I cant get that working ^^^ be it a timer or not
[07:54:58] <Kingsy> unless ajax() has a function that allows you to run something as its loading
[07:56:43] <Kingsy> that clock is AWESOME.. haha its hypnotic :P
[07:56:49] <droid909> decx: cool huh, helping people by being idle ;)
[08:00:26] <MikeD_> anyone here use sparklines?
[08:06:58] <frank_o> Is this the best way to check if an element or any of its children has the class `bingo`? var ifMatch = someElement.hasClass('bingo') || someElement.has('bingo');
[08:08:01] <decx> element.hasClass('bingo') || element.find('.bingo').length
[08:10:33] <frank_o> decx: cool many thanks!
[08:22:46] <athli> I would like to do something like var req = $.ajax({url:url,type:"POST",data:JSON.stringify(data),contentType:"application/json; charset=utf-8",dataType:"json"}); req.abort();   I use jquery 2.1.1 and have no idea how to get underlying jqXHR object. Promise is returned, which is fine, I handle success and error via .then(). But how do I get jqXHR, before any of these callbacks are called, so I could cancel the request
[08:24:47] <shoky_> athli: $.ajax returns the jqXHR object (which is also a promise). you can call .abort() on it
[08:27:09] <athli> shoky_: thanks. thats what I expected, but it says abort is undefined and if I look in debug console whats in this object..  I can see only Promise related functions..  I will create jsfiddle..
[08:28:21] <shoky_> athli: http://jsfiddle.net/dcpbr/3/
[08:30:01] <Kingsy> hmm I am failing to understand this.. say I have a simple .get() call, which loads a page us jquery. Is it possible to run a loop which say counts up.. until it finishes loading.. just counts up as fast as it can
[08:30:54] <MikeD_> Kingsy: what are you actually trying to accomplish with a count?
[08:32:15] <Kingsy> MikeD_: well the goal is to have a number which randomly changes (it doesnt matter what the numbers are) until the ajax request is done, the changing number is then replaced with a real number which is the result from the request
[08:32:33] <Kingsy> so its kinda like a "loading" notice.. but its a ticking number
[08:32:52] <athli> shoky_: thanks, using then() instead of done() and error() caused my problem.. because then() return pure Promise..
[08:33:17] <shoky_> athli: ah right. then() creates a new promise
[08:34:00] <shoky_> athli you can still use it like  var req = $.ajax(...);  req.then(...);  req.abort();
[08:34:37] <MikeD_> Kingsy: so you want to use a setTimeout() or setInterval() to fire changes to some some state (possibly UI) until canceled by your callback?
[08:34:45] <athli> shoky_: yes, its clear now. Thanks.
[08:35:05] <MikeD_> keep in mind you only have 1 thread, so a tight loop to a billion will block
[08:35:59] <Kingsy> I see.
[08:38:15] <MikeD_> heh, that response sounds like you're not happy with the situation
[08:38:31] <Kingsy> hahahah.. no just trying to figure out a workable example here
[08:38:32] <Kingsy> :D
[08:39:12] <MikeD_> perhaps you could just animate a picture of a sheep while waiting for the callback?
[08:39:23] <thaifood> hi, what's the easiest way to test if none in a group of radio buttons are checked please ?
[08:40:17] <MikeD_> thaifood: .find(":checked").length  ?
[08:40:21] <Kingsy> haha
[08:40:49] <john-dev> thaifood: use each
[08:41:12] <john-dev> hm, .length is even better
[08:42:33] <thaifood> trying length now
[08:44:34] <veleiro8> I have an object that has mousedown event + mousemove (its a slider), but there's also elements with mouseenter and mouseleave events behind it.  I'd like to still have those triggered, is that possible without rewriting the actions during the overlaying object's mousemove?
[08:46:08] <veleiro8> maybe a hover through
[08:48:14] <MikeD_> can/should jquery wrapper for a dom object have properties pointing to in-memory objects like arrays?
[08:49:19] <thaifood> MikeD_: am i using find incorrectly?  http://laravel.io/bin/wa0OL
[08:49:47] <thaifood> oh sec
[08:50:57] <thaifood> i'm trying to get the checkboxes that are not checked
[08:51:12] <thaifood> getting close i think
[08:52:39] <veleiro8> blah i got it
[08:52:44] <thaifood> works, thanks !
[08:59:42] <miriamdeana> is toggle() deprecate?  and if so, why does the documentation have it listed?  or was it added back?
[09:00:49] <decx> toggle() toggles show/hide
[09:01:05] <decx> the old toggle(function,function) is deprecated
[09:04:43] <miriamdeana> decx:  Oh, okay.  I want to specify how it toggles and was having sometrouble getting it to work.  then when I googled it, I kept seeing deprecation
[09:05:42] <miriamdeana> decx: Any idea why something like this wouldn't change the work correctly?:  .toggle("blind");
[09:07:41] <decx> that's ui specific i believe
[09:07:58] <decx> ie uses jquery-ui
[09:08:05] <decx> with effects
[09:11:34] <miriamdeana> decx: well, it "works" meaning that it shows and hides the correct div, but the "blind" effect isn't used.    instead it expands from the top left corner, going down and right at the same time.
[09:11:58] <johannes__> Hello, is there a way to use the query easing functions for changing my own parameter with a easing. For example like easing(start_value, end_value, duration, update_interval, function (current_value) { change_my_custom_value(current_value) });
[09:12:36] <johannes__> So that my function is executed on every update_interval during the duration?
[09:12:37] <decx> miriamdeana well include jquery ui
[09:13:29] <miriamdeana> oh ok
[09:14:17] <decx> and be prepared to be hated because these effects are frankly a shitty timewaste :D
[09:14:31] <robertmaxrees> johannes__ you can define your own easings for animations, sure. http://www.brianwald.com/journal/creating-custom-jquery-easing-animations is one guide
[09:14:35] <miriamdeana> decx: thanks
[09:15:21] <miriamdeana> decx: oh, no!  just saw your last comment.  so do you usually just create your own?
[09:15:32] <decx> when i get forced by a client
[09:15:43] <decx> i prefer either no animation or something kinetic
[09:15:59] <decx> btw, slideToggle() will do the same as blind without the need for jquery ui
[09:16:20] <johannes__> robertmaxrees: But I don`t want to add a custom easing: I want a parameter, which is not css to be changed in as easing interval...
[09:16:38] <robertmaxrees> johannes__ what's the parameter then?
[09:16:42] <miriamdeana> decx: you mean kinetic.js?
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> could you provide a little more detail?
[09:17:12] <miriamdeana> decx:  I saw that one and tried it too.  didn't do what I expected it to.
[09:17:17] <decx> miriamdeana i just mean any kind of "physical" animation
[09:17:21] <johannes__> It`s the rotation value of a cube which is created with three.js 3d object library
[09:17:32] <miriamdeana> decx: ok
[09:18:29] <johannes__> Ok, I think I found what I need: http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/08/17/tweenjs-for-smooth-animation/
[09:18:42] <robertmaxrees> johannes__ something tells me that you'd have to reinit the plugin every time, but I can't be sure
[09:18:43] <johannes__> Somebody else wrote  library for that, thank you robertmaxrees
[09:47:06] <frank_o> Hi! Trying to reuse some code. How come this won't return true: `$.fn.myCheck = function(container) { container.find('.my_div').length }` + `if($.fn.myCheck(someDiv)) { doSomething; }`
[09:47:10] <frank_o> While this does? `if(someDiv.find('.my_div').length) { doSomething; }`
[09:48:02] <decx> it has to return
[09:48:18] <decx> return container.find...
[09:48:28] <frank_o> oh i see
[09:48:34] <frank_o> oh man that is excellent THANK YOU
[09:48:51] <decx> excellent, air guitar solo
[09:49:09] <frank_o> haha
[09:50:13] <decx> dinner time
[10:21:07] <Diplomat> Hey guys, I have a quick question. For some reason I'm not able run scripts when I click on my button that I loaded with $.get.. I'm using $('.mybutton').on('click', function() etc.. but it doesn't work. Any ideas?
[10:21:31] <robertmaxrees> because $('.mybutton') doesn't exist when you run the bunding.
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> *binding.
[10:21:43] <Diplomat> Yes, but shouldn't "on" fix it ?
[10:21:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:21:55] <robertmaxrees> you can use event delegation though.
[10:21:56] <Diplomat> I tried delegate too , didn't work
[10:22:01] <robertmaxrees> delegate is deprecated
[10:22:12] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('click', '.mybutton', function() {});
[10:22:24] <Diplomat> aight, ill try
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> the parent has to be something that exists on pageload that is an ancestor of the button.
[10:22:58] <robertmaxrees> you can use document or body if you'd like, though I'd bind a little further down.
[10:23:16] <Diplomat> hmm.. I don't think I have anything better
[10:23:28] <robertmaxrees> the entire page gets ajaxed in?
[10:23:33] <BillCriswell> Be careful with doing it on body though.
[10:23:44] <robertmaxrees> or is there a parent element that exists on pageload that you're appending content to?
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> because binding to body or document or whatever is begging for bugs and stuff.
[10:24:17] <BillCriswell> mobile browsers won't bubble up that far unless there's an empty onclick="" attribute on <body> or the element that triggers the even is a <a> or a form element.
[10:24:31] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah, that too.
[10:24:49] <Diplomat> Mm.. not sure if it's correct: $('div#wrapper').on('click', '.editrouter', function() but it doesn't work
[10:25:05] <robertmaxrees> does that wrapper div exist on pageloag?
[10:25:06] <robertmaxrees> *pageload?
[10:25:08] <Diplomat> Yes
[10:25:14] <robertmaxrees> and it doesn't get replaced or anything, right?
[10:25:18] <Diplomat> Nope
[10:25:31] <decx> well good thing i never replaced my entire body !
[10:25:32] <robertmaxrees> then .editrouter isn't a child or something is preving the propagation of the event.
[10:25:38] <decx> what a sentence
[10:26:02] <robertmaxrees> D:
[10:26:30] <decx> technically i did though as cells die after a while and are replaced
[10:28:31] <Diplomat> Well, this page is loaded inside div#page-container which exists on pageload.. but it doesn't work :/
[10:28:46] <Diplomat> this .editrouter is inside that page that is loaded with $.get
[10:29:01] <robertmaxrees> then you've got bad markup or something else is going on.
[10:29:13] <robertmaxrees> also, don't prepend selectors with tagnames, especially ID selectors.
[10:29:25] <robertmaxrees> can you share the final markup at all?
[10:30:11] <Diplomat> Yes, one moment
[10:32:01] <Diplomat> http://jsfiddle.net/32dhebep/ here's my HTML
[10:32:37] <Diplomat> http://jsfiddle.net/32dhebep/1/ < I added my click thing too
[10:32:43] <robertmaxrees> and your code is in a document ready?
[10:32:54] <robertmaxrees> or at the end of the page, before the closing body tag?
[10:33:54] <Diplomat> Hmm.. My script is loaded in header and that HTML is pretty much everything that is loaded on pageload
[10:34:12] <robertmaxrees> is your js in a document ready?
[10:34:27] <Diplomat> #dashboard-container just holds dashboard buttons and is hidden when #page-container is filled
[10:34:33] <Diplomat> yes it is
[10:34:40] <robertmaxrees> can you share the rest of your JS then?
[10:34:57] <Diplomat> Yes, one moment
[10:35:28] <Diplomat> http://jsfiddle.net/32dhebep/2/
[10:36:57] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up.
[10:37:56] <Diplomat> I can't see any errors in console as well
[10:39:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check to make sure you're getting an element with the calss "editrouter" added.
[10:39:23] <robertmaxrees> and that the casing and stuff is correct.
[10:39:36] <robertmaxrees> because without seeing the returned markup from that $.get() call, i'm flying blind.
[10:40:25] <Diplomat> hehe
[10:40:32] <Diplomat> found an idiotic mistake
[10:40:38] <robertmaxrees> and that was?
[10:40:40] <Diplomat> I had 2x class attribute
[10:40:47] <Diplomat> and editrouter was in the second one
[10:40:48] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[10:40:55] <robertmaxrees> it's always somethiong simple.
[10:40:56] <Diplomat> first one had bootstrap's button classes
[10:40:58] <Diplomat> yup
[10:41:12] <Diplomat> but thank you for your help :D
[10:41:21] <robertmaxrees> of course.  sometimes you just need a rubber duck.
[10:42:11] <blackkbot> i missed something but thats a good quote
[10:42:41] <robertmaxrees> it's so true though!
[10:43:31] <blackkbot> it reminds me of this old friend of mine who worked at a sex shop and stole a rubber duckie vibrator...
[10:44:56] <blackkbot> a creative way to hide such a device but it doesn't work when wet... a fatal flaw
[10:50:59] <blackkbot> i suppose the moral of the story is not all rubber ducks were made to have fun with while getting clean
[10:57:35] <fission6> if i have a click handler on an outder div and someone clicks on an inner div, how can i get the proper target in the event object which represents the element/node i actually bound the click handler too, (i know its the same as "this" in the callback) is it event.target or event.currentTarget
[10:58:16] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated event handler and $(this) will be what you want.
[10:58:35] <blackkbot> event.target should be the target of the event
[10:58:57] <blackkbot> logically**
[10:59:10] <robertmaxrees> sure, but in thise case it sounds like they really want a delegated listener :D
[10:59:10] <Cork> blackkbot: it isn't actually
[10:59:28] <Cork> target is the top most element in the dom structure that the event could start from
[10:59:33] <blackkbot> lamesk
[10:59:37] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right.
[10:59:48] <Cork> and sometimes that is actually higher then you expect
[10:59:58] <fission6> hmm thnaks
[11:00:02] <Cork> <a><i class="icon"></i></a>
[11:00:06] <Cork> clicking the icon
[11:00:13] <Cork> will set event.target == i not a
[11:00:15] <blackkbot> if you want all the elements you can use $('*:hover') fni
[11:00:20] <Cork> even if the event handler is on a
[11:00:30] <Cork> blackkbot: ugg NO
[11:00:37] <Cork> use delegated
[11:00:54] <Cork> or wait selector
[11:01:05] <robertmaxrees> the delegated syntax of .on() is what you want.
[11:01:07] <Cork> window.activeElement should work for that though
[11:01:30] <Cork> humf, sorry
[11:01:35] <Cork> hover != focus >_<
[11:01:52] <blackkbot> you would have to event.target and iterate through parentNodes until you ran out of dom
[11:02:09] <blackkbot> not that that is going to be any way slower
[11:02:18] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[11:02:27] <blackkbot> but that also doesn't account for only the elements that are underneath the mouse
[11:02:42] <blackkbot> and outside of the parentnode iteration
[11:02:54] <Cork> ah
[11:03:12] <Cork> fission6: simplest option is to use delegated event handler
[11:03:19] <Cork> then you will get a correct this variable
[11:03:34] <robertmaxrees> lol so back to what I was saying... ;)
[11:03:43] <Cork> alternatively you can do something like $(this).closest('selector')
[11:03:52] <Cork> (that is what delegate uses)
[11:04:08] <Cork> $(this).closest('div.special')
[11:04:11] <Cork> opps
[11:04:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:04:17] <Cork> $(event.target).closest('div.special')
[11:04:51] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean by that?
[11:05:03] <blackkbot> <<i want ^^
[11:05:04] <Cork> take my old a i example
[11:05:23] <Cork> $(event.target).closest('a') would get you the a tag
[11:05:30] <Cork> always the a tag
[11:05:42] <Cork> how many div, spans, i, b or so on you have inside
[11:05:57] <robertmaxrees> what did you mean by "that is whyat delegate uses" i mean.
[11:06:31] <blackkbot> delegate probably just binds the function from the event listener additon function to the element
[11:06:34] <DelphiWorld> hello
[11:06:37] <b-lew> is there a way to escape a dash in jquery? jQuery thinking I'm trying to subtract count from share but a json file has share-count as an object.
[11:06:39] <b-lew> var testData = data.share-count;
[11:06:40] <DelphiWorld> stupid question pocibely;)
[11:06:56] <DelphiWorld> what's the recomandation of a logo size?
[11:07:03] <Cork> robertmaxrees: $(document).on('click', 'a') => $(document).bind(function(event) { if($(event.target).closest(selector).length > 0 } { callback.call($(event.target).closest(selector, event)); });
[11:07:05] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld not a great place to ask heh
[11:07:13] <Cork> robertmaxrees: simplified though
[11:07:15] <jdewald> b-lew: data['share-count'];
[11:07:17] <blackkbot> 2 or 3x bigger than the screen of their computer
[11:07:25] <DelphiWorld> robbyoconnor: lol i asked that cause i  use jqm, so i thought there's someone here;)
[11:07:27] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: The answer could be anything..
[11:07:27] <robertmaxrees> Cork that doesn't sound right to me.
[11:07:33] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld bad autocomplete
[11:07:49] <DelphiWorld> lol
[11:07:52] <Cork> robertmaxrees: what doesn't sounds right with it?
[11:07:59] <DelphiWorld> cause this guy was not here last time:P
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> Cork i thought the delegated syntax of .on() was using the underlyng event delegation provided by JS.  lemme go poke, I could be wrong.
[11:08:45] * DelphiWorld is blind, systemfault
[11:08:54] <b-lew> Thanks jdewald !
[11:08:58] <b-lew> Worked perfectly!
[11:09:02] <Cork> robertmaxrees: there is no underlying delegation in js
[11:09:05] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld yeah, this isn't a very good place to ask for something like that.
[11:09:05] <jdewald> cool beans
[11:09:08] <Cork> robertmaxrees: it relies on bubbling events
[11:09:19] <jlovick> Hi, How do i trap 404, and 403 errors when using jquery.getscript?
[11:09:28] <robertmaxrees> Cork right.  i've always heard the technique referred to as "delegation"
[11:09:30] <Cork> robertmaxrees: but in order to find what element it should use as target, it uses .closest
[11:09:39] <DelphiWorld> ok robertmaxrees
[11:09:45] <Cork> robertmaxrees: delegation and bubbling is two very different things
[11:10:16] <Cork> robertmaxrees: or rather delegation is an extension of bubbling
[11:10:38] <Cork> robertmaxrees: where you reverse through the tree to find the element you care about from the one you bound the event on
[11:10:38] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: btw my collapsible issue solved
[11:10:46] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of being a pedant, Cork.
[11:11:01] <robertmaxrees> you know what I meant
[11:11:10] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld cool.  no idea what you're talking about lol
[11:11:13] <Cork> robertmaxrees: not really, just explaining as you said you didn't follow
[11:11:29] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: you helped me for toggling divs no?
[11:11:33] <decx> cork vs duch? i get the popcorn ! :
[11:11:39] <blackkbot> addEventListener('click',function(e){if (e.eventPhase ===Event.AT_TARGET)/*call your function with [yourfunction].call(e.target);e.bubbles = true;});
[11:11:51] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld i help a lot of people with a lot of things.  i rarely remember haha
[11:12:05] <DelphiWorld> robinsmidsrod: lol, regardless. it's operational :P
[11:15:28] <robertmaxrees> decx haha
[11:15:48] <robertmaxrees> just trying to understand where they're getting this .closest() use from. i'm in the codebase right now and I'm not seeing it.
[11:15:59] <decx> popcorn was in vain :/
[11:16:40] <decx> was looking forward to a fight between #jquery american support jesus vs #jquery eu support mohammed :(
[11:16:47] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:28:11] <DeVito> is there a way to trigger a window resize on button click.
[11:28:11] <DeVito> I have a div that will not auto expand the full width unless the window is resized
[11:28:28] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('resize');
[11:29:00] <DeVito> $(window).trigger('resize'); ?
[11:29:03] <robertmaxrees> or define your resize logic in an actual function and then call it once after the fact.
[11:30:38] <DeVito> that did the trick!
[11:30:39] <DeVito> thanks
[11:35:56] <jlovick>  How do i trap 404, and 403 errors when using jquery.getscript? At the moment, the script just aborts when it happens,which isnt very helpful
[11:36:34] <systemfault> jlovick: You can probably add a fail handler, no?
[11:37:11] <jlovick> i tried that, but it only triggers on other erros such as a fail, not on 404, or 403
[11:37:28] <robertmaxrees> 404 and 403 should trigger fail.
[11:39:40] <jlovick> hmmm here is my code https://gist.github.com/4af6887e5d232623a956.git  it is set to a 403 target
[11:41:02] <systemfault> Weird.
[11:41:22] <systemfault> jlovick: Looks like you're right... http://jsfiddle.net/gycqLvnj/
[11:42:04] <jlovick> systemfault: so glad i wasnt being just exceptionally stupid,
[11:45:39] <systemfault> Wow, first time I see something like this with jQuery
[11:46:03] <tet_> hi
[11:47:12] <robertmaxrees> looks like getscript is broken.
[11:47:14] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[11:47:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/gycqLvnj/2/
[11:48:52] <systemfault> It works the way it should... IF
[11:49:04] <systemfault> You use $.ajax and add the option:    crossDomain: false
[11:49:17] <robertmaxrees> look at the example I did.
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> just used $.axaj()
[11:49:25] <robertmaxrees> *ajax
[11:49:27] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/gycqLvnj/3/
[11:50:07] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: But you have not specific 'script'
[11:50:19] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: dataType: 'script' is the problem here.
[11:50:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, wonder why.
[11:51:14] <systemfault> My last code works... but only because I set crossDomain to false..
[11:51:17] <systemfault> I'll check the source.
[11:51:24] <crankharder> why does the .ajax() 'error' argument not look at, and provide me, a response object the same way that 'success' does?  What if the server responds with a validation error (which should be a 400 response), and the server passes back a validation message - shouldn't that be a response object just like the success handler?
[11:51:57] <robertmaxrees> systemfault http://stackoverflow.com/a/3408547/923919
[11:51:58] <robertmaxrees> there we go.,
[11:53:34] <robertmaxrees> crankharder maybe try .fail(function(xhr) {console.log(xhr.responsetext)}) - is that not what you want"?
[11:54:11] <systemfault> So, it's a combination of 'crossDomain' detection + 'script' ajax transport...
[11:54:13] <systemfault> Coolz
[11:54:20] <crankharder> robertmaxrees: responseText comes back as just a string, so I have to build the object myself.  it just seems kinda weird that success and error don't both have the same function definition
[11:55:41] <crankharder> let me phrase it a different way... say I'm using .ajax(error: function(){...}), and the server generates more than one error message - how do I handle that in the error handler?
[11:56:40] <systemfault> crankharder: The server could return JSON serialized from something like { errors: [ "error1", "error2"] } for example..
[11:56:59] <systemfault> crankharder: Then in your error handler (jQuery), you could simply $.parseJSON the xhr.responseText
[11:57:00] <crankharder> systemfault: true. but it also has to respond w/ 200 for it to work, and then it's handled by the 'success' handler
[11:57:07] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:57:20] <crankharder> systemfault: guess i'm asking why I have to parseJSON in the error handler but not the success handler
[11:57:31] <crankharder> it just seems... inconsistent
[11:57:32] <systemfault> crankharder: Because the error could be anything?
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:57:43] <crankharder> the success could be anything?
[11:57:45] <robertmaxrees> sometimes there is no response body, just headers.
[11:57:54] <systemfault> crankharder: No, success is what YOU expect.
[11:58:12] <systemfault> In practice, errors in not necessarily what you expect.
[11:58:24] <crankharder> true, unexpected errors - waht about expected errors?  validation errors for example
[11:58:35] <crankharder> from #web a few minutes ago, that's a 400 response, right?
[11:58:39] <systemfault> Example.. the server returns a timeout message containing HTML, should it $.parseJSON it?
[11:58:39] <crankharder> so that dumps you in the error handler
[11:59:15] <crankharder> a timeout would normally be a 500
[11:59:28] <crankharder> 400's should be expected and coded for in the client, right?
[11:59:53] <robertmaxrees> errors in general should be handled.
[12:00:06] <robertmaxrees> if you have services that are 404ing a lot, might want to look at why.
[12:00:13] <crankharder> forms?
[12:00:17] <crankharder> users submit stupid information all the time
[12:00:26] <robertmaxrees> your stuff shouldn't 404 as a result.
[12:00:33] <systemfault> crankharder: Then handle 400s
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> having a defense mechanism is a great strategy, but if your site is 404ing from form submissions, you should look at why and fix it.
[12:01:20] <crankharder> systemfault: so you'd recommend checking for the expected status code?
[12:01:24] <systemfault> crankharder: jQuery.ajax isn't a REST-optimzied client
[12:01:27] <systemfault> crankharder: Sure.
[12:02:17] <systemfault> In the fail handler... check the status code and if it's 400... it means that the user hasn't send what's expected.
[12:02:31] <systemfault> sent
[12:02:33] <robertmaxrees> or rethink your interfact when handling user input.
[12:02:40] <robertmaxrees> *interface
[12:02:46] <crankharder> seems reasonable
[12:17:35] <Lencl> I have .onclick().. how do I get the ID of that which was clicked
[12:18:12] <Lencl> Let's say it's <div class="link" id="id_here">  ... I have .$('.link)..onclick() { ... how do I get the ID here? ...}
[12:18:14] <umf_gg> var $theIDval = $(this).attr('id')
[12:18:37] <Lencl> ahh I did try that
[12:18:40] <Lencl> but I made a mistake on it
[12:18:42] <Lencl> thank you
[12:18:44] <umf_gg> np
[12:40:37] <Paradisee> hello
[12:41:58] <robertLunch> good afternoon
[12:42:01] <Paradisee> how can i do what the comment says?
[12:42:02] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/11BQXM4
[13:01:40] <wa5ted> yo
[13:28:55] <jiffe> anyone know a good component for display messages?  Maybe something simiar to a gmail thread
[13:37:45] <sargas> why can't I call trigger() on myObj[i], when myObj = $('#some_id').children('li');
[13:37:52] <sargas> any ideas?
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> because you're getting the underlying DOM node with that syntax.
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> use .eq(i) instead.
[13:38:24] <sargas> robertmaxrees: let me try it
[13:40:13] <sargas> robertmaxrees: Thank you, that worked.
[13:40:36] <sargas> Now I need to find out a way to check whether a click event came from a human or from the script
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd change the way you're handling you code if possible.
[13:41:13] <sargas> e.originalEvent is always defined on my case
[13:41:23] <sargas> robertmaxrees: how so?
[13:41:55] <robertmaxrees> dispatch to the appropriate logic explicitly instead of triggering the event again if possible, though that can depend on what you're actually trying to do.
[13:43:14] <sargas> robertmaxrees: hmm
[13:43:41] <sargas> robertmaxrees: Can I pm you the link for my code?
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> if you can PM it to me, you can share to the room :)
[13:44:11] <sargas> robertmaxrees: sorry, of course
[13:45:51] <sargas> its a little plugin I'm trying to  make
[13:45:57] <sargas> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/andradei/1506cd07c7a7e181598a
[13:47:00] <robertmaxrees> why are you binding you've got some syntaxt errors btw.
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> *syntax
[13:48:08] <sargas> because I want click to stop the auto clicking if a human clicked in one of the children elems
[13:48:31] <sargas> sorry, lots of clicks
[13:48:44] <robertmaxrees> did you see my comment about syntax errors?
[13:48:48] <sargas> where is my syntax error?
[13:48:54] <sargas> or errors
[13:49:09] <sargas> could you point me the line?
[13:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you never actually define i or status.
[13:49:26] <robertmaxrees> *declare
[13:49:28] <robertmaxrees> same with childrenarray.
[13:49:37] <sargas> ?
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> you need var in fron of i and status
[13:49:49] <sargas> I defined them first thing
[13:49:51] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/cnlvn1q/
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> you defined them but never declared them.  not declaring them means they get hoisted to the global namespace.
[13:52:17] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't need to do your click even binding in an .each() - that's implied
[13:52:34] <robertmaxrees> $childrenArray.click() will get you exactly what you want.
[13:53:05] <sargas> I didn't know that, thanks!
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> and you can pass along optional data using .trigger() - .trigger('click', {fake: true}), then access that data via your event handler - it's in the event object - e.fake in this case.
[13:56:02] <sargas> that's what I wondering, I was reading the docs for .click()
[13:56:38] <sargas> thank you for correcting me thought process
[13:56:42] <sargas> about this whole thing
[13:56:55] <robertmaxrees> .click is just a convenience method for .on() btw.
[13:57:13] <robertmaxrees> .on('click', rather
[13:57:18] <sargas> right, and .click() is the same to trigget('click')
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:58:46] <sargas> I mean, trigger('click')
[13:58:56] <robertmaxrees> i know what you meant :)
[14:00:10] <sargas> now my code looks like this: https://gist.github.com/andradei/1506cd07c7a7e181598a
[14:00:27] <robertmaxrees> childrenarray still isn't defined.
[14:00:35] <sargas> I still can't seem to get e.isHuman evaluated
[14:00:35] <robertmaxrees> *declared. keep screwing that one up.
[14:02:32] <sargas> I updated the gist
[14:03:43] <sargas> e.isHuman is undefined...
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zhhnLzcv/ this is what you want.
[14:06:30] <scar> if i have a slider thats like 2500x700 -- but i only want what's able to be viewed by the monitor to view, and NOT have it resize-- what's the best way without horizontal scrolling?
[14:06:46] <robertmaxrees> scar huh?
[14:06:51] <scar> just wanan position it nicely in the center. should i set the width to a certain amount, and have a parent with width:100% and overflow:hidden ?
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> flip that - the parent would be width: 100%; and overflow: hidden;
[14:07:32] <scar> i want a huge slider so in case someone has a wide monitor they can see the full view of the slide. if they have a smaller screen, i want it to just crop it
[14:07:47] <scar> hmm
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> btw you might want to rething using a carousel.
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> *rethink
[14:08:21] <scar> what do you mean
[14:08:25] <scar> no slider at all?
[14:08:30] <scar> im not trying to do a carousel slider
[14:09:24] <robertmaxrees> "slider" referes to a specific control that has a thing you can grab to select something on a range.  "carousel" the the visual dealio that lets you display elements one after another.
[14:09:35] <sargas> robertmaxrees: it is working now, thank you again, I updated the code in case you want to see it
[14:09:37] <scar> why would you say rethink it?
[14:09:41] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> sargas awesome! glad to hear.
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> scar end users are almost completely bind to content in carousels.
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> *blind.  i cannot type today.
[14:10:15] <scar> ahh i hea you
[14:10:17] <scar> hear**
[14:10:22] <scar> this in particular is for a portfolio site
[14:10:29] <scar> big, vibrant images.. that's all they want
[14:10:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:10:39] <scar> i do hear you tho. i tell everyone i know dont use content sliders
[14:10:44] <scar> lmao
[14:10:59] <scar> im glad you were referring to that and not some other reason i shouldn't use a slider
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> *carousel ;
[14:11:15] <scar> these are just big images showing people in action, etc. it's not at all supposed to give any content whatsoever
[14:11:41] <scar> well when i think carousel i think a slider w/ multiple slides visible
[14:11:49] <scar> unless you're saying all sliders are carousels
[14:11:57] <robertmaxrees> that.
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/slider/ this is a slider.
[14:12:20] <scar> oh yes, okay.
[14:12:29] <scar> i wonder why slider became the term to be falsely used
[14:12:34] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[14:12:38] <robertmaxrees> because the images "slide"?
[14:12:39] <scar> good point. so what would a Carousel Carousel bee?
[14:12:55] <scar> a carousel with a carousel effect?
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> all carousels are carousels.
[14:13:08] <scar> yes
[14:13:10] <robertmaxrees> they can have effects or different styling.
[14:13:18] <scar> ahh so it'd be just a different style
[14:13:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:13:22] <scar> 3 slides showing
[14:13:27] <robertmaxrees> vs 1
[14:13:34] <robertmaxrees> both would be carousels.
[14:13:40] <scar> im trying to know what the proper use is, bc i can't believe i didnt realize slider is the wrong term haha
[14:13:44] <scar> ive used the jquery slider often
[14:13:48] <scar> epiphany today
[14:13:54] <scar> very minor, but still nonetheless lmao
[14:14:00] <scar> i appreciate your time.
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> of course :D
[14:14:17] <scar> oh since you seem to be well versed in carousels of all types....
[14:14:42] <scar> there's a carousel effect i've seen where the prev/next "slides" are visible and when you go left or right it will "Swing" into view like it's on a 3d ring of some type
[14:14:54] <scar> any idea what that effect is? i've seen it before and cannot seem to even find it anymore!
[14:14:56] <scar> :)
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> I'd need to see an example.
[14:15:57] <scar> yeah unfortunately that
[14:16:00] <scar> 's my issue
[14:16:12] <scar> oh well. i'll try to locate it and when i do, hopefully just see what it's doing then
[14:22:27] <scar> robertmaxrees, ill try to explain just once maybe itll ring a bell
[14:23:18] <scar> think of an actual horse carousel. if you were sittin on the outside not birdseye-- but watching each horse come into view.. you'd see the horse in front of you and as it moved, you'd see the horse next to it go off in the distance while the one on the other side comes more into view, etc. the ones ive seen only show the current, prev and next, not necessarily anymore
[14:23:27] <Velveeta> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:24:06] <scar> yeah i know, but this isn't for content.
[14:24:19] <Velveeta> you're just wanting to know that 3d swing effect?
[14:24:37] <Velveeta> you should be able to accomplish that with some 3d css transitions
[14:24:44] <scar> yeah pretty much
[14:24:50] <Velveeta> you can find similar transitions on sites like slid.es
[14:25:08] <scar> that's good to hear, but i have no idea where to start. i don't have much experience with custom effects on carousels
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> don't get much experience with carousels in the first place haha
[14:25:55] <scar> yeah i hear ya
[14:25:58] <Velveeta> you'd probably want to do something like have a start/middle/end type of class modifier for the items in display
[14:26:13] <Velveeta> the start and end ones would have css transition effects to make them look like they're rotating into or out of view
[14:26:13] <scar> it's nice to have this URL though. i've shown articles and explained this before.. sometimes with success, others not.
[14:26:21] <Velveeta> the middle one would just slide to the right but remain visible
[14:27:33] <scar> i wish i could find that carousel i've seen before so maybe i could look haha. i'll just play with 3d swings i guess. i'm not sure how to make sure the classes would toggle in multiple positions. even with things like bxSlider or something.
[14:27:48] <scar> bx has always been my go to, bc the need for those have been minimal, but alows for easy implementation
[14:27:53] <Velveeta> or you could potentially just do it with a single container that holds 4 elements, and using :nth-child to denote what transition effects to apply to each one as it moves through that frame, and just push and pop them in and out of that container
[14:28:03] <scar> hmm
[14:28:08] <scar> interesting idea
[14:28:24] <Velveeta> i have a little time to kill before the end of the day, i'll see if i can throw together a fiddle proof of concept
[14:28:35] <scar> that would be kickass actually
[14:28:41] <scar> just like your processed counterpart
[14:28:42] <scar> :)
[14:29:54] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta is actually a mild celebrity./
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> he got the twitter username before the company and still has it.
[14:30:15] * Velveeta flashes a thumbs up.
[14:30:31] <robertmaxrees> that makes him a solid bro imo.
[14:31:43] <scar> yeah it does
[14:31:51] <scar> how many times have they asked for it?
[14:31:54] * Velveeta chest bumps the room.
[14:31:58] <Velveeta> not a single one
[14:32:00] * robertmaxrees falls over
[14:32:01] <scar> nice
[14:32:02] <Velveeta> unfortunately
[14:32:08] <scar> they don't want to give you the upper hand
[14:32:09] <Velveeta> cuz i'd sell it in a heart beat and go to the casino
[14:32:14] <scar> he who speaks first...
[14:32:35] <scar> yeah. one day you just disappear, and twitter files a motion on grounds of abandonment :D
[14:32:46] <scar> i mean velveeta files motion
[14:32:56] <scar> ok i killed it. sry :)
[14:33:10] <Velveeta> yeah, i gotta publish another tech post to try to stay twitter-relevant :D
[14:33:21] <Velveeta> especially now that i got followed by irish the other day
[14:34:34] <robertmaxrees> whaaat?!
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> luckyyy.
[14:34:45] <tw2113> oh yea Velveeta ?
[14:34:50] <tw2113> well i got RTed by FluentConf
[14:35:11] <Velveeta> nice
[14:36:20] <tw2113> all i did was ask if everyone has hugged their developer tools lately
[14:38:25] <Velveeta> heheheh
[14:48:32] <scar> heh
[14:50:53] <Guest30680> Hi. I have a task I think jquery's deferred object can help me with, but I'm not sure.  I need a global variable I can add some callbacks to, and then a way to "wait" for all of those callbacks to be finished; where the callbacks are not ever executed until somebody is waiting on them.
[14:53:49] <Velveeta> guest30680: create an array and pre-register your deferred promises to it for each of those user events, then resolve the deferreds per action as the user completes them... once the array has initially been constructed, call $.when.apply(this, promiseArray).done(yourUltimateCallback)
[14:54:00] <Velveeta> scar: i'm still working on your demo
[14:55:03] <wasabii> Well, the user isn't completing anything: they just need to be executed when another set of code needs them. There are modules which are going to inject html templates into the DOM, and another part of hte code which expects those templates to be there. But if nobody control elsewhere on the page ever needs templates, they never need to be injected.
[14:55:38] <robertmaxrees> wasabii huh?  that sounds like a function to me.
[14:55:44] <Velveeta> well, the point is that as each item completes, whether it's user-driven or not
[14:55:56] <Velveeta> you need to pre-register some deferreds and assign their promises to an array
[14:56:06] <wasabii> But they might never be waited on, and so in that case I do not want them to ever execute.
[14:56:13] <Velveeta> as each item is completed, whether it's user-driven, or some function that injects content, or whatever, have it resolve its appropriate deferred
[14:56:29] <Velveeta> and you pass that array of promises to $.when to set up a callback to be executed when all of them are resolved
[14:57:09] <robertmaxrees> i feel like that's not really needed in this case personally.
[14:59:42] <Velveeta> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qxasLubk/
[14:59:54] <Velveeta> except that in this case, it's all user driven
[15:00:09] <Velveeta> in your case, you'll predefine some deferred objects to be resolved by whatever it is that's injecting your content
[15:01:21] <wasabii> I guess the thing doing the wait has to invoke the method to do the work, though.
[15:01:29] <wasabii> And only should do so if the corresponding promise isn't yet finished.
[15:02:53] <Velveeta> i'm not following that
[15:03:12] <robertmaxrees> he wants to only run functions if they haven't yet been run.
[15:03:16] <wasabii> Correct.
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> to fetch content.
[15:03:47] <wasabii> So, these modules need to register callbacks that will only be run one, if another user needs them to be run.
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> "another user" not following.
[15:04:16] <wasabii> "User" being some other code elsewhere, sorry.
[15:04:34] <Velveeta> so they'll need to check their own deferred state then
[15:04:55] <wasabii> Say I have some template providers: that will fetch templates from various resources. And some controls, which require templates to be available. If there are no controls on the page, then no templates need to be loaded. But if a control needs templates, he has to have all of those run. But if two controls need templates, then they only have to be run once.
[15:05:06] <robertmaxrees> you can set up an object whose properties are the contents of each of the calls you're making and check those properies to see if they're populated.  if you don't have something, run the appropriate function, otherwise use the fetched content.
[15:05:34] <robertmaxrees> or use deferreds.
[15:07:42] <Velveeta> i'd probably do this with some kind of central object registry that has knowledge of all of the potential templates on the page that can be loaded, and predefined deferred objects for them... then each control that has need of a template would notify the central object that it needs them loaded, and receive back a deferred promise from that object, which would them call each unresolved template to load, and resolve its deferred as it complete
[15:07:43] <Velveeta> s, and resolve the deferred it handed back to the control, when the templates were loaded
[15:09:15] <Velveeta> so objA has knowledge of all templates that can be loaded, and controlA tells objA i need templateA and templateB... objA creates a deferred that resolves itself based on templateA and templateB being resolved, and passes a promise back to controlA, then if templateA and templateB haven't already been loaded, it loads them and resolves those deferreds when they complete, which will resolve the promise it handed back
[15:09:25] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to approach this one :D
[15:09:52] <Velveeta> if controlB then says it needs templateA to be loaded, objA hands back a deferred promise based on templateA's deferred, which has already been resolved, so that promise will instantly resolve and controlB can use its functionality right away
[15:10:11] <hye> hi
[15:10:19] <robertmaxrees> hi, hye!
[15:10:34] <hye> hey robertmaxrees
[15:10:35] <hye> I have an array that stores comma delimited values... how can I sort the array based on one of the values in the comma delimited format?
[15:10:50] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:10:58] <robertmaxrees> !paste
[15:10:58] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:11:03] <hye> array1[0]='abc,xyz,abc'
[15:11:24] <hye> i want to sort the array by xyz... dont sure if thats possible
[15:12:51] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to sort in there.  could you share a more fleshed-out example?
[15:14:09] <hye> just imagine there are more array items then that
[15:14:36] <robertmaxrees> no thanks :) i hope you get the help you're looking for!
[15:14:56] <hye> lol
[15:14:59] <hye> ok, thanks for trying
[15:15:09] <wasabii> Velveeta, that's about what I've got so far. Minus the knowledge part.
[15:18:42] <robertmaxrees> hye wait, are you trying to sort an array based on the second value within each of the CSV strings?
[15:19:32] <hye> robertmaxrees yes
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort is what you want then.
[15:20:15] <hye> thanks robertmaxrees let me research that.
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4rxbvpm6/
[15:24:41] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:26:32] <Velveeta> wasabii: if you're still around, here's a quick proof of concept: http://jsfiddle.net/q2L87q27/
[15:27:08] <Velveeta> scar: i wasn't able to get a demo to behave properly for you, but i did dig up this site that might help you further along in what you're looking for: http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/carousel.html
[15:27:13] <hye> your a genius robertmaxrees!
[15:27:22] <hye> thank you very much, let me adapt that to my code and see if its working
[15:27:39] <Velveeta> wasabii: also, as i was writing that, i had the thought that the CA doesn't even need knowledge of everything at the start, it only needs to have knowledge of what's being requested at any given time
[15:28:06] <Velveeta> so you could delay the registration of those deferred objects until such time as they're requested, and then cache those, and use them for other controls that might be requesting the same templates
[15:28:13] <Velveeta> so long as everything is using a common naming scheme
[15:29:28] <hye> robertmaxrees i seems like i am trying to sort an object... is that even possible/
[15:29:29] <hye> ?
[15:29:46] <systemfault> No
[15:29:58] <systemfault> The keys inside an object don't have an order.
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> unless the object is an array :D
[15:30:13] <systemfault>  :)
[15:30:33] <hye> so i imagine if I convert the object to an array, it would work? or i should start with an array to begin with?
[15:30:48] <robertmaxrees> start with an array.
[15:31:06] <hye> no way to convert the object to an array?
[15:31:29] <robertmaxrees> erm, not without creating a placeholder
[15:31:31] <Velveeta> i've been bitten in the ass before with object key order... a few years back, we were caching numeric property ids on an object as keys, and using them to iterate over and load content in the order the keys had been added
[15:31:52] <Velveeta> but chrome automatically sorted numeric object keys as if they were array indexes, which threw off the order of our output
[15:32:07] <robertmaxrees> D:
[15:32:09] <robertmaxrees> that's terrifying.
[15:32:22] <robertmaxrees> did it take you a while to figure it out?
[15:32:34] <Velveeta> yep, apparently it was specific to chrome at the time
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[15:32:58] <robertmaxrees> just goes to show - don't rely on order for object properties :D
[15:32:59] <Velveeta> and it was stated that there's no guarantee in any browser as the order of keys in an object, some order them in the order they were created, others alphabetically, etc
[15:33:04] <Velveeta> exactly
[15:33:32] <Velveeta> ok, now it's time for me to get out the door, the wife will kill me if i stay *too* much later
[15:34:44] <Velveeta> i get to fill out a bunch of peer reviews and my own self review tonight, since i've put them off for the better part of 2 weeks and they're due tomorrow
[15:35:14] <scar> Velveeta, thanks for the time though
[15:35:30] <scar> and maybe because i was using the term slider all along ;)
[15:37:51] <Velveeta> no problemo, and nah, it wasn't that, i just couldn't get my selectors to properly target like i was hoping
[15:38:00] <Velveeta> and then i killed too much time at work and now i gotta get home :D
[15:46:45] <scar> :D well ty
[16:36:43] <masu> hi i have a select drop down box that im trying to trigger a change event, the change event handler is already bound
[16:37:22] <masu> but the change event is not triggered
[16:37:39] <masu> no matter what i try to do,
[16:38:04] <robertmaxrees> does the dropdown exist on pageload?
[16:39:11] <masu> ya i guess so
[16:39:20] <masu> its coded using html
[16:39:37] <masu> the dropdown isn't generated dynamically
[16:39:47] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle would be awesome.
[16:48:42] <decx> and then there was silence
[16:49:25] <robertmaxrees> yessss
[16:49:34] <__joshua__> any suggestions on how to add swipe to jq touchpunch?
[16:53:49] <masu> hmm it only works if i reattach the event handler
[16:53:59] <masu> the trigger( 'change' )
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> masu sounds like you're attaching before the element exists.
[16:54:08] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a doc ready?
[16:54:11] <masu> yea
[16:54:18] <masu> thats hwy!
[16:54:20] <masu> thank you sir
[16:54:23] <masu> god bless you
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:54:33] <robertmaxrees> oh, the doc ready?
[16:54:39] <masu> yea its in doc ready
[16:54:48] <masu> im attaching the handler after
[16:54:56] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:57:05] <masu> its been a long day man
[16:57:09] <masu> you ever get like so tired
[16:57:17] <masu> that your mind doesnt work
[16:57:24] <masu> its been a long two weeks
[16:57:31] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i take lots of mental breaks throughout the day so that doesn't happen.
[16:57:41] <masu> yea thats what i should do too

[23:31:02] <Cork> mukesh_: again, please don't highlight me unless to answer a question i've asked
[23:31:05] <Cork> just ask the channel
[23:31:40] <Cork> mukesh_: to answer the question you could possibly use calc() depending on if you can live with the browser support limitation
[23:33:27] <shebbi> hi, my jquery suddenly behaving off for click events. for example, when i register an on click event for say class="request" that changes a class attribute say class="cancel". that class on click doesn't respond until i refresh the page. it's like it's not live anymore.
[23:34:03] <shebbi> $('img.cancelRequest').on('click', function(){} ); <-- doesn't trigger until a page refresh
[23:34:36] <Cork> shebbi: if i read your description correctly, that doesn't make sense
[23:34:43] <Cork> try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[23:35:20] <shebbi> Cork: I updated my jquery, and it's not live anymore
[23:35:48] <Cork> shebbi: again, if you have a problem try to reproduce it in a clean environment
[23:36:13] <Cork> your statement dosen't make sense, or i'm misunderstanding
[23:36:44] <shebbi> $('img.sendRequest').on('click', function(){ // add the class to img cancelRequest} );
[23:36:51] <Cork> ?paste
[23:36:51] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:36:54] <shebbi> but:
[23:36:58] <shebbi> $('img.cancelRequest').on('click', function(){} ); <-- doesn't trigger until a page refresh
[23:37:03] <Cork> MAKE A DEMO
[23:40:00] <ruby_on_tails> how can i define the type of a queue i create so that i can apply promise() on it?
[23:40:20] <Cork> type of queue?
[23:40:28] <Cork> do you mean name or what?
[23:41:10] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: basically i have written a custom function like .fadeOut() which does some css3 animations not jquery based, now i want to use .promise() with it
[23:41:15] <ruby_on_tails> but promise() doesnt work
[23:41:31] <ruby_on_tails> probably because the custom function i have written uses queue which is not of type 'fx'
[23:41:32] <ruby_on_tails> ?
[23:41:43] <Cork> ya, sounds likely
[23:41:49] <ruby_on_tails> so how do i define the type?
[23:41:59] <Cork> s/type/name/
[23:42:38] <Cork> you can't really define the name that other animations should use
[23:42:54] <Cork> what you need to do is block that queue
[23:43:01] <Cork> and then trigger it when your queue is done
[23:43:45] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: i have this > element.move().promise().done(function(){ bingo })
[23:44:18] <ruby_on_tails> element is multiple elements, move is css3 transitions, how do i trigger bingo when ALL elements are done with the css3 transitions?
[23:44:29] <Cork> hmm
[23:44:35] <Cork> ah, wait
[23:44:48] <Cork> yup http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[23:44:50] <ruby_on_tails> .move() does the anumation using delay which means it happens one by one so bingo should happen after last animation
[23:44:58] <Cork> promis takes a queue name as a first argument
[23:45:10] <Cork> *promise
[23:45:27] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:45:29] <Cork> so element.move().promise('your-queue-name').done(function(){ bingo })
[23:47:01] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: but thats not working, this is function .move() http://pastebin.com/MYnzpZKx check the queue name
[23:47:29] <ruby_on_tails> and this is the main code > $(".label-heads i").move().promise('custom').done(function(){ console.log("asd"); })
[23:47:37] <ruby_on_tails> asd never shows up
[23:48:04] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: $(this).dequeue('custom')
[23:48:23] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: or simply $(this).dequeue('fx')
[23:48:41] <Cork> depending on what you want to achieve
[23:51:13] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: there is some other problem
[23:52:20] <ruby_on_tails> http://pastebin.com/M4wwCkaC #9 never executes, #7 does 60 times, (there are 60 elements being moved)
[23:54:35] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: if i remove 'custom' from #8 things work fine
[23:57:26] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: i think .promise needs queue type and .queue using a queue name, are they different?
