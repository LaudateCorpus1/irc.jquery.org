[07:57:22] <PShell> I'm very new to jQuery and trying to learn the basics, i have an application which generates a form with some text and textboxes, if i run $(".form-group") then 3 items/objects(?) are returned, how do i select a specific object instead of all them?
[07:57:31] <PShell> Something like $(".form-group(0)")
[07:57:34] <PShell> Something like $(".form-group(1)")
[07:57:35] <PShell> etc
[08:26:08] <Cork> PShell: var group = $('.form-group'); group.eq(1) group.eq(2) group.eq(3) or just .each()
[08:35:24] <PShell> Thanks :)

[09:10:10] <hollusion> how do i select by data-value content?
[09:10:29] <thykka> hollusion, add double quotes around the 142
[09:10:47] <hollusion> same result
[09:11:50] <thykka> hollusion, https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/63qp72yb/
[09:12:05] <hollusion> i believe the problem is
[09:12:11] <hollusion> i didnt set via html attribute
[09:12:21] <hollusion> i set via .data()
[09:13:18] <thykka> right... jQuery's .data() wasn't exactly built for usage with custom attributes..
[09:13:52] <thykka> from jQuery docs:
[09:13:54] <thykka> To set a data-* attribute value, use attr.
[09:14:26] <thykka> Since jQuery 1.4.3, data-* attributes are used to initialize jQuery data. An element's data-* attributes are retrieved the first time the data() method is invoked upon it, and then are no longer accessed or mutated (all values are stored internally by jQuery).
[09:16:48] <hollusion> alright ill do it via attr, thank you
[09:21:49] <hollusion> thykka, i set the value via attr
[09:21:50] <hollusion> http://dpaste.com/2G2BZ1Q
[09:22:04] <hollusion> but .data() is unable to retreive it now
[09:22:16] <thykka> use one, not both
[09:22:40] <hollusion> "An element's data-* attributes are retrieved the first time the data() method is invoked upon it"
[09:22:48] <hollusion> seems confusing to me
[09:23:44] <hollusion> but $('.filter:first').data() returns the correct values
[09:23:52] <hollusion> strange
[09:24:05] <thykka> jQuery's .data existed before dataset was a thing, so whatever interplay they currently have, is entirely shoehorned and full of surprises
[09:24:11] <thykka> I would avoid it if possible
[09:24:56] <thykka> not only that, but I avoid jQuery entirely, when possible :D
[09:32:52] <hollusion> ive gotten used to it so bad
[09:32:58] <hollusion> and a lot of plugins use it too
[09:33:18] <hollusion> i hate javascript built in selection methods
[09:33:53] <thykka> what's wrong with them?
[12:40:53] <hollusion> they are too long and non intuitive
[13:28:39] <sol1d> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4333
[13:28:56] <sol1d> this uhh getting pulled ?
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:30:06] <robertmaxrees> looks like it was merged.
[13:30:37] <sol1d> so 3.4 has this fixed ?
[13:31:14] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it's been released yet
[13:31:40] <robertmaxrees> 3.3.1 is still the latest release.
[14:52:02] <limpc> hi. anyone here make use of ckeditor?
[14:52:32] <limpc> having a paste issue (evt.data.dataValue)
[14:55:21] <Flyste> I'm using a multiple select field, and accessing the result with $("#productlink :selected").text(), is there a way to have this return an array for each select item?  Right now it seems to be a string with all the selected options
[14:57:06] <limpc> $.each and populate an array?
[14:58:45] <Flyste> Mmmmm
[14:59:17] <Flyste> Can I just do array[] = $("#productlink :selected").text() ?
[15:01:25] <robertmaxrees> Flyste .map
[15:01:40] <robertmaxrees> or check .val() instead of .text()
[15:03:25] <Flyste> I need both
[15:03:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> anyway, gotta go.
[15:03:42] <robertmaxrees> kbyeee
[15:05:22] <limpc> why would you need both?
[15:12:04] <Flyste> Figured it out: $("#productlink :selected").each(function()
[15:12:35] <Flyste> I need the id of the thing to access the item in the database and the text to display which items have been selected in the interface
[15:13:03] <limpc> <option value="<id>">text</option>
[15:13:28] <limpc> $('#yourselectbox').val() would return [id,id,..]
[15:15:28] <limpc> var ids = $('#yourselectbox').val(); var txt = $('#yourselectbox').text();  alert("Updating "+txt);  $.ajax({ url='/post/here', dataType='json', data={ id: ids } });
[15:32:26] <spinningCat> is there a plugin you can suggest  for div slider?
[16:47:48] <AliG1000> Hi. I am trying to move the div containing the image above 'testimonial-content' class: https://jsfiddle.net/mnhk7p8d/4/  If I run test1 or test2, they sort of work, but not quite. Any clues?
[18:01:24] <robertmaxrees> spliiiiiiiiiit
