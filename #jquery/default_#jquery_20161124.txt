[03:36:35] <MACscr> any ideas here why the inputs are draggable and the background color for them are no longer showing? I can resize them, but thats it.  https://jsfiddle.net/11u2w0nr/6/
[03:56:22] <Cork> MACscr: you are setting top on an element inside an element with absolute position
[03:56:33] <Cork> so you're moving the input field out of the visible area
[03:58:30] <MACscr> Cork lol, it might be to late for me to follow that. lol
[04:13:44] <arup_r> Hi this code works https://jsfiddle.net/rLv4ohs7/2/. With triggerHandler() I can pass the extra params to the event handler function clickMeHandler(). But how do I pass another data which I manually click on "Click Me" <span> ?
[04:13:53] <arup_r> Can you give me a pointer for the same?
[04:14:15] <arup_r> *another data when I
[04:16:42] <AdamPDotty> Hmm, what kind of data? You can have an attribute data-payload to the span.
[04:19:18] <arup_r> I need to pass jquery object. But the 2 APIs is contradicting . My example is a simple usecase of my actual problem. :)
[04:25:50] <AdamPDotty> Anyway you could go simpler with https://jsfiddle.net/rLv4ohs7/3/
[04:26:08] <arup_r> thanks let me see
[04:26:10] <AdamPDotty> You could put more than "content" in the data
[04:27:06] <AdamPDotty> Strings could be put in the html-tag, and data could be saved programmatically in a DOM node.
[04:27:20] <AdamPDotty> other data
[04:27:54] <arup_r> AdamPDotty: ok, yes. that data I saw in doc. But problem is, with triggerHandler() i can't set it. I need the event handler to execute manually and programatically
[04:28:38] <arup_r> so that's why I am a bit out of direction right now.
[04:28:43] <AdamPDotty> it get calls on click, whether you call click() or click on element
[04:28:54] <AdamPDotty> oh gosh grammar
[04:28:59] <AdamPDotty> it gets called
[04:29:29] <arup_r> ok
[04:32:35] <arup_r> but "click" will do really click, and I want just the handler to execute. Yes, my usecase is like that. :) I have dropdown, which on chnange does perform some logic. But sometime, the page loads with already value selected. So in that case, I want the handler just to execute, don't need to change or anything.
[04:33:27] <arup_r> just the function to execute. and triggerHandler() does the same. But only trouble with extra argument, which I have to send
[04:34:39] <AdamPDotty> ok, then use triggerHandler
[04:35:45] <AdamPDotty> maybe this gives you an idea (just sketching)

[05:52:14] <dan_j> Hi. I've got an input box with type = file. How do I access the selected file name? I've tried this but it doesnt work.
[05:52:14] <dan_j> $('#form_uploadmeterreadings_file').files[0]

[08:34:26] <AdamPDotty> Now where is that promised question?
[08:35:41] <shoky> weiserhei: you can always do it without a selector $('#someFormID :input').filter(function() { return $(this).attr('name').indexOf('myname') >= 0 })
[08:36:07] <shoky> weiserhei: but in this case there's also  $('#someFormID :input[name*="myname"]')

[09:26:03] <ice9> how to load bootstrap tab content from external file?
[09:27:38] <Cork> => ##twitter-bootstrap
[09:29:05] <richardlampitt> Hello all, noob question: I've got a little AJAX thing that I've inherited from my boss that toggles an icon from an affirmative / negative state and back again. The code works so far as it updates the database value, but the icon doesn't change. As I'm almost completely new to jQuery, I have no idea where to even start troubleshooting: https://paste.ee/p/L04Fk halp.
[09:30:49] <Cork> richardlampitt: you mean the structure_update event?
[09:30:59] <richardlampitt> Cork: Honestly, I have absolutely no idea
[09:31:04] <Cork> ...
[09:31:21] <Cork> you don't know what it is that isn't doing what it should be doing?
[09:31:35] <Cork> and how exactly would we be able to help?
[09:32:01] <dijitaltrix> richardlampitt sounds like you want to change the icon when the thing is clicked on
[09:32:02] <richardlampitt> Oh, yes I know what it should be doing, I just don't know which bit of code I'd need to poke to try and get it to that: It's upposed to be toggling an icon between an X and a checkmark
[09:32:11] <richardlampitt> dijitaltrix: Yus
[09:32:20] <Cork> richardlampitt: ya, so the question is it the structure_update event?
[09:32:25] <Cork> or the other event you pasted?
[09:32:29] <NoiseEee> richardlampitt: if the db value changes but not your UI, its probably between lines 40 and 51
[09:32:37] <Cork> cause the second one looks like it should be doing what it is expected to do
[09:32:51] <richardlampitt> Oh wait, that's two functions?
[09:33:02] <Cork> yes
[09:33:07] <Cork> that's why i asked
[09:33:17] <richardlampitt> Ah, okay. Sorry for being dumb ^^
[09:33:31] <richardlampitt> NoiseEee: Righteo.
[09:33:56] <richardlampitt> Let me check which function it is exactly
[09:38:07] <richardlampitt> Cork: region_update is the one that's being called: that particular one works just fine, I've discovered: it's coming up in firebug's console log at the line where it logs to console. A separate functions called 'knowledge_areas' is used on the page that doesn't work. Lemme pastee for you quickly
[09:38:48] <richardlampitt> https://paste.ee/p/CDHHr << Here's the one that doesn't work
[09:39:35] <Cork> and response.status is?
[09:40:02] <richardlampitt> 1 moment
[09:40:31] <richardlampitt> {"status":"error"} ?
[09:40:41] <Cork> always?
[09:41:10] <Cork> if yes, then you are prob sending the wrong data to the server and it is returning an error
[09:41:15] <richardlampitt> goes between error and success
[09:41:17] <Cork> and that is prob why things doesn't work
[09:41:19] <Cork> ah
[09:41:26] <Cork> so you need to check that instead of "true"
[09:41:28] <richardlampitt> Okay
[09:43:00] <richardlampitt> huh. Wehn I check on my local machine, I get the same alternation between status and error, but also as part of the response a complete HTML page
[09:44:02] <richardlampitt> <div id='codeigniter_profiler' style='clear:both;background-color:#fff;padding:10px is how it starts, which means that the debugging output that code igniter adds to pages is being appended to that response
[09:44:15] <richardlampitt> Let me pester the CI channel a moment
[09:55:56] <richardlampitt> Right, I've fixed that particular problem, now just to find out where it's getting that error from
[09:56:10] * AdamPDotty looks innocent
[10:05:45] <richardlampitt> Woot - it was an issue with the responses that the underlying php was sending, not the jQuery itself
[10:05:56] <richardlampitt> Thanks for the help
[10:15:09] <weiserhei> thanks shoky, seems to do exactly what i was looking for
[10:25:18] <duoi> hi! how can i batch replace words in a giant table? $('.class').html().replace(/True/g,"False"); doesn't seem to do anything, and gets as far as $('.class').html() if i put it in the console before Chrome's entire dev tools freezes up
[10:27:25] <AdamPDotty> what you do, returns a string. So as long as you do not use it, nothing much will happen
[10:27:34] <AdamPDotty> besides the freezing obviously
[10:28:11] <AdamPDotty> Maybe iterate over the attributes, where you expect "True" as value.
[10:29:32] <duoi> AdamPDotty so `.replace(/True/g,"False")` doesn't actually perform any changes?
[10:30:52] <AdamPDotty> it does .. in the strong you got returned from .html()
[10:30:55] <AdamPDotty> string
[10:31:22] <AdamPDotty> hmm, not even that
[10:32:32] <AdamPDotty> so no, it just returns a manipulation of the returned string
[10:33:05] * AdamPDotty hates to be wrong
[10:35:24] <duoi> AdamPDotty I put it inside $("body").children().each() and it's now achieving the desired results :) Thanks dude!
[12:07:44] <hhee> guys
[12:07:59] <z1haze> how would I go about getting the current option when I have a multiple select?
[12:08:21] <hhee> i need vertical menu with jquery like here http://www.w3schools.com/ - but there is horizontal menu, i need same but vertical
[12:08:26] <NoiseEee> z1haze: :selected
[12:08:35] <z1haze> that gets me all of them thats selected
[12:08:48] <NoiseEee> what do you mean by 'current option' ??
[12:08:52] <hhee> can i accomplish it with pure jquery with jquery ui?
[12:09:02] <z1haze> i want to limit the number of selected options in a multiple select
[12:09:18] <z1haze> so if the limit 5 is.. when they reach 5 items, they cant select more, but they can unselect current ones, etc
[12:09:28] <z1haze> cant figure it out
[12:09:46] <NoiseEee> z1haze: count the number of :selected
[12:09:56] <z1haze> that doesnt help me to un select the current item
[12:10:01] <NoiseEee> z1haze: sure it does
[12:10:09] <z1haze> ..
[12:10:12] <z1haze> im confused this
[12:10:25] <z1haze> because change() context of this is the select itself, not the option
[12:10:38] <NoiseEee> z1haze: if its 6, remove the 'selected' attribute
[12:10:53] <z1haze> this isnt the option, its the select
[12:10:56] <NoiseEee> z1haze: you can query for the actual element the event happened on
[12:11:04] <NoiseEee> event.target
[12:11:05] <z1haze> $('select').change( ... {
[12:11:21] <NoiseEee> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[12:11:21] <z1haze> coulda sworn i just tried that and it gave me the select element
[12:11:28] <z1haze> i will try again
[12:11:35] <NoiseEee> z1haze: yes but within the callback, query for the target
[12:11:55] <z1haze> i remember trying console.log($(e.target)) and i got the select agin
[12:13:00] <z1haze> yea, definitely getting the select each time
[12:13:58] <fuchstronaut> $(e.target).find(':selected'=
[12:15:18] <fuchstronaut> You might have to cache what was previously selected and if the cache cointains 5 or more items, you do $target.find(':selected').not(cached)
[12:17:07] <NoiseEee> z1haze: change the event from 'change' to 'click;
[12:17:15] <z1haze> here i made a little fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/
[12:17:27] <fuchstronaut> click might fire if it is not changed
[12:17:45] <NoiseEee> fuchstronaut: which is fine for the purpose
[12:17:46] <z1haze> seems like such a simple issue but i guess it isnt
[12:17:50] <NoiseEee> fuchstronaut: its a multi-select
[12:17:59] <NoiseEee> "click" achieves what you want
[12:18:06] <z1haze> care to branch out on this fiddle and try it?
[12:18:13] <fuchstronaut> z1haze: NoiseEee is right
[12:18:33] <z1haze> so like $('select.limit').on('click', 'option', function(e) { ?
[12:18:42] <NoiseEee> z1haze: yes, e.target is the <option>
[12:18:53] <NoiseEee> z1haze: and you have to count select:selected regardless
[12:19:01] <z1haze> i know t hat part
[12:19:05] <z1haze> i had that figured out
[12:19:09] <NoiseEee> :)
[12:19:11] <z1haze> just wasnt able to prevent/undo the check
[12:19:16] <z1haze> let me try this
[12:19:28] <z1haze> hmm
[12:19:37] <z1haze> nothing firing, i would imagine its because of materialize
[12:19:47] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/1/
[12:19:53] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/9asnmuc4/ @ z1haze
[12:20:14] <z1haze> yea i know vanilla wise
[12:20:26] <z1haze> but this framework handles the event different im trying to find a work around
[12:20:56] <NoiseEee> well good luck
[12:20:58] <z1haze> both of the fiddles i made arent working right, the first one fires the event target for the select again, and the second one doesnt work at all
[12:21:01] <z1haze> no attempt?
[12:21:04] <z1haze> haha
[12:22:41] <fuchstronaut> z1haze: with both your examples I am not getting any output in console
[12:23:22] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/ this one does.. the first one but its only the select :\
[12:23:55] <z1haze> and the select one doesnt work because it changes the markup
[12:24:00] <z1haze> so thers no more 'option'
[12:26:45] <NoiseEee> z1haze: so adjust your code for the markup that the plugin creates
[12:26:57] <z1haze> i tried span, i tried li, it doesnt fire
[12:27:16] <z1haze> ah yea, because its not a select at al
[12:28:13] <fuchstronaut> z1haze: maybe materialize has somehing like a callback for selections?
[12:28:39] <z1haze> been googling for about 40 minutes now
[12:28:48] <z1haze> guess thats one thing they dont have
[12:32:13] <Utils> Just out of curiosity, if you have a page and you're loading data by ajax, depending on your internet speed this may take a couple of seconds or longer. What do people display in this instance? I feel like leaving part of the page content blank is a bit bland.
[12:32:50] <z1haze> a loader?
[12:33:08] <fuchstronaut> rotating something
[12:33:31] <z1haze> good thing is you have about a billion options
[12:34:53] <Utils> sure, but let's say you had maybe 5 boxes on the page and you're waiting for 1 ajax call to complete for the content to be filled. that's a lot of circles. would you perhaps clear the page with 1 loading circle in the midddle and show the page when the ajax call has been competed?
[12:35:08] <z1haze> there are full page loads as well
[12:35:17] <z1haze> maybe a big overlay with a centralized loader
[12:35:33] <z1haze> https://codepen.io/mimoYmima/pen/fisgL
[12:39:45] <z1haze> cmmonnnn i need to solve this
[12:41:34] <shoky> z1haze:  .load() was removed in jq 3
[12:41:36] <shoky> ;p
[12:42:06] <z1haze> lol that isnt my fiddle i just googled him an example
[12:42:31] <shoky> yeah but you were trying to fix it
[12:43:24] <z1haze> i just did the quick add yea
[12:43:33] <z1haze> and said fk it cause i didnt know it was removed
[12:43:51] <z1haze> hey, it got the point across
[12:45:40] <benlieb> I’m using $.ajax and specifying       dataType:  'json', however I notice that my Accept header still includes some variety: Accept:application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.0
[12:45:42] <z1haze> sooo... can you fix my problem?
[12:46:19] <benlieb> my app (Ruby on Rails) is responding a bit unreliably to this, and on certain errors, returns HTML
[12:46:49] <benlieb> is there a way to only give accept JSON header?
[12:49:56] <shoky> z1haze what problem?
[12:50:55] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/5/ i need to be able to limit the number of options (that part i can do) but this stupid thing doesnt give the proper data in the event the cancel/uncheck an item
[12:51:52] <fuchstronaut> benlieb: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ -> contentType might be what you are looking for
[12:52:16] <shoky> or the "accepts" option :P
[12:53:25] <shoky> z1haze: didn't understand what the problem is if "that part i can do" ?
[12:53:51] <z1haze> if you look at the fiddle you'll understand
[12:54:05] <z1haze> theres no way to get the option that has been changed
[12:54:17] <benlieb> fuchstronaut: I think that is to let the server know what kind of data it’s GETTING
[12:54:43] <z1haze> thats what a request header is
[12:54:52] <shoky> z1haze why do you need the option that has been changed?
[12:55:09] <z1haze> because lets say i have a limit of 5 options, once they hit 5, they cannot select more items
[12:55:28] <z1haze> and if they uncheck one of the 5 items, they can select one more.. therefore id need the option in question, right?
[12:55:37] <z1haze> to handle checking/unchecking a particular option
[12:58:52] <shoky> didn't understand what you mean, or what "that part i can do" means
[12:59:04] <shoky> if you can limit them, what's the problem
[12:59:14] <z1haze> ignore that then
[12:59:27] <z1haze> i guess I cant
[13:03:13] <Caspan> hey guys i was looking at this Jfiddle that lets a user add a class to a table row to make it look selected, I was thinking of doing this for my interface but i have a question, how would you handle mobile devices. If you have to hold Ctrl and click to get multiple rows
[13:03:20] <Caspan> http://jsfiddle.net/oscarj24/ctLm8/2/
[13:03:49] <Caspan> i am thinking you would have to use checkmarks
[13:04:11] <z1haze> using tab/press
[13:04:13] <z1haze> tap*
[13:04:29] <Caspan> if i tap a row i can select it but waht about multi
[13:05:03] <z1haze> shouldnt matter
[13:05:20] <z1haze> just have to change the function around to not uncheck when they tap outside of a checked item
[13:05:23] <Caspan> there is no way to hold Ctrl to select multi rows though
[13:05:27] <Caspan> ahh
[13:05:34] <Caspan> i get what you are saying
[13:05:50] <z1haze> what are you highlighting for? to select for some sort of filter?
[13:06:58] <fuchstronaut> benlieb: think I missunderstood your question
[13:07:20] <z1haze> so shoky i made a bootleg solution, but its not modular because it requires a variable be set to store the previous value.. anytthoughts on how to make this more reusable? https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/6/
[13:08:11] <z1haze> i guess i could just bind to a data attr huh
[13:08:18] <Caspan> z1haze: yeah its for selecting for deleting, merging or modifying an item
[13:08:29] <Caspan> its a budgeting application
[13:08:40] <z1haze> probably want something more than a class then
[13:08:47] <z1haze> checkboxes are a good idea like you said
[13:09:02] <Caspan> i have it now so that you have to click to select then click to select another
[13:09:18] <Caspan> that works on both mobile and desktop
[13:09:39] <Caspan> jsut was trying to find a way i could use Shift+click on the desktop
[13:09:48] <Caspan> but then that would not work on the mobile
[13:10:03] <z1haze> you could do double tap
[13:10:07] <Caspan> I think ill jsut leave it like so
[13:10:12] <Caspan> nope
[13:10:13] <z1haze> look into hammerjs
[13:10:21] <Caspan> double tap just jooms the screen on a mobile browser
[13:10:30] <Caspan> its a pain
[13:10:35] <z1haze> look at hammerjs
[13:10:38] <Caspan> okay
[13:12:45] <Caspan> its either that use a long press to select and hold the selection
[13:13:26] <Caspan> so on the desk top i can use Alt and Shift for multi selection and on mobile press and hold for multi selection
[13:13:47] <Caspan> bah should just leave it
[13:13:51] <shoky> z1haze: heh i did the same thing.. https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/8/
[13:13:56] <Caspan> im being picky on my interface
[13:14:12] <shoky> z1haze: and no i don't see any way to make it nicer with this plugin you're using
[13:14:22] <shoky> no options/events/etc
[13:14:31] <z1haze> here's what i did without the variable! https://jsfiddle.net/sa8305ae/9/
[13:15:00] <z1haze> this would be pretty modular, right?
[13:15:33] <shoky> er i guess, if you're happy with that
[13:15:50] <z1haze> well i mean whats a better way to do it
[13:16:01] <shoky> i'd ditch the plugin without thinking twice personally ;P
[13:16:07] <z1haze> this seems better than declaring a global variable
[13:16:19] <z1haze> im trying not to use too much in this
[13:16:23] <z1haze> the framework i kinda like it
[13:16:26] <shoky> it doesn't have to be global
[13:16:30] <z1haze> http://materializecss.com/
[13:16:33] <shoky> doesn't matter
[13:16:46] <shoky> yes i saw
[13:16:55] <shoky> a plugin with no options/events/anything, yuck :P
[13:17:04] <z1haze> yea its pretty bad as far as that goes
[13:17:21] <z1haze> overall though..
[13:17:35] <shoky> (and personally i hate material design but thats me)
[13:18:03] <z1haze> im not too fond of it myself actually, but giving it a try - first time using any sort of framework for a while now
[13:19:25] <z1haze> but anyway, happy turkey day folks, im gonna run. thanks for the help
[13:20:01] <shoky> save your thanks, gimme turkey
[13:55:51] <Sayona> Something not ok...
[13:55:58] <Sayona> this code work in firefox and in chrome not http://pastebin.ca/3741963
[13:56:21] <Sayona> any ideea?
[13:57:20] <qakhan> hi all, i have tables, when 1 click on first row it addClass() and row turn into red. i also have Expand/Collapse button at the end of same row, to hide and show the table rows.
[13:58:38] <qakhan> when i press Expand/Collapse button it add the class which i dont want to do. i tried to remeve the class when Expand/Collapse button pressed. but its not removing the class
[13:59:14] <qakhan> here is my code https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/9/
[14:05:03] <v0lksman> hey all!  is there a way to chain a query for a condition like this:  https://jsbin.com/fokoreniwu
[14:05:21] <v0lksman> I want to select all elements that end with locator_id but NOT id_locator_id
[14:20:12] <qwidj> how should i set up an element to be invisible before performing a fadeIn ?
[14:22:06] <qwidj> eg as the element is first rendered when the page is loaded, i want it to be insivible, then i fadeIn to visible when page is loaded
[14:23:46] <qwidj> tried setting to opacity 0 in css
[14:24:04] <v0lksman> display:none
[14:24:50] <qwidj> unfortunately that also leaves it invisible after fadein
[14:25:04] <qwidj> oh no, sorry
[14:25:07] <qwidj> that does work, thank you
[14:37:05] <Caspan> is there an easy way to get all input elements that are the child of a selector and then create a virtual form and submit it?
[14:37:44] <Caspan> I want to use the existing names and values inside the input elements
[14:37:55] <Caspan> I jsut need to get them all and build a virtual form and submit it
[14:38:07] <v0lksman> yeah I believe that is form.serialize() or something similar
[14:38:24] <Sayona> can anyone hlpe me: this code work in firefox and in chrome not http://pastebin.ca/3741963
[14:38:28] <Caspan> the reason is all these inputs are inside a table and you cannot put a <form> around the tfoot of a table :)
[14:38:45] <Caspan> v0lksman: Ill have a look
[14:49:37] <Utils> I've asked in Vue and they seem to be stumped and also recommending to use Vue's show/hide. Anyway, I'm using jQuery's show/hide methods on a div. They work, until a split second later when for no reason at all... the style attribute gets removed. Is there a way, either in javascript / jQuery or chrome, to detect any style change to an element and track where that change came from?
[14:49:57] <Utils> Something is removing the style and I'd like to sort of ... trace it to the culprit.
[14:52:06] <snover> Utils: in chrome dev tools, https://zetafleet.com/i/5837454900c2a.png
[14:53:42] <Utils> That's sweet. I didn't know about that. I did actually get closer to what's happening. I'm applying styling before the document has fully loaded, and jQuery is removing it upon document ready for whatever reason. I'll check out dev tools and see if there's a specific point.
[14:54:20] <Caspan> Utils: are you dping any Ajax calls
[14:54:22] <Caspan> doing
[14:55:00] <Caspan> Utils: I had an issues where I was not understanding that i was trying to apply styles to items that were not even in the DOM yet!
[14:55:59] <Utils> Yes I am but no that isn't the case. The place I was performing hide, the element does exist (can confirm with .length too) it just happens to execute before document ready. If I wrapped the hide inside $(function() { ... }); then it perform a expected with no issues
[14:56:15] <Utils> This is what led me to believe jQuery is removing jQuery added styling upon document ready.
[14:56:24] <Caspan> okay
[14:57:02] <Utils> I added the breakpoint, but it doesn't do anything upon page reload which is when the issue occurs. It only works when changing the attributes after everything has been fully loaded.

[15:20:45] <Caspan> i am trying to select the TH tags below the ID

[15:33:06] <Caspan> oh please i need to learn that
[15:33:07] <shoky> (and selecting jquery)
[15:33:43] <Caspan> thank you
[15:33:53] <Caspan> i always hate trying to find that damn hosted link
[15:34:15] <Caspan> now this is funny
[15:34:17] <Caspan> errr
[15:34:20] <Caspan> im an idiot
[15:34:28] <Caspan> so in my template i use TH tags
[15:34:57] <Caspan> when i click on a cell it copies the TD tag down to the th tag
[15:35:04] <Caspan> and it becomes a td tag
[15:35:39] <Caspan> forgot my code is dynamic... errr
[15:35:41] <Caspan> sorry
[15:36:18] <Caspan> and if i could select the parent I should have jsut looked at its children to see what they were
[15:46:22] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/jbawyyha/
[15:46:48] <Caspan> so question i have now selected the TD and now i am looping around each one to get the data-name and data-value from them
[15:47:12] <Caspan> is there a way i can enumerate  element1  to element2, element3, element4 ?
[15:47:29] <Caspan> so the first run would be 1 second run would be 2
[15:47:30] <Caspan> etc
[15:48:43] <Caspan> I know i can use index
[15:48:54] <Caspan> how woudl i write out
[15:49:07] <Caspan> element1.name=$(this).data("name");  with element1 replaced with element + index
[16:48:22] <PSUser2> what do you write if you want to click on element aTags[1] from this array?    var aTags = document.getElementsByTagName("span");
[18:00:14] <fekz> jQuery newbie here. I need to multiply #unit value by 2 then add the result to a percentage specified in #perc -- can anyone check my code and see what's wrong? :(  http://pastebin.com/7SEFHfKi

[18:32:44] <Billym1976> Hi, off-topic but does anyone know if stay idle in an IRC channel will drain my 3G data?
[18:43:44] <amdp> hi can anybody help me to understand this part of a script? http://paste.debian.net/898579/
[21:17:15] <l33n> I have a button that onclick starts this startAjax() function, but I am getting nothing when I click it, no error either, any thoughts: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8b847bf4cbcd408363296e32a45e3572
[21:37:55] <shoky> l33n: startAjax() call is inside startAjax itself?   anyways this should work  https://gist.github.com/antishok/4ba53942e19b7a166800f2f4c997d44b
[21:38:30] <shoky> l33n: if it doesn't.. check which console logs you get, check the browser's devtools network tab and see what's going on with the request. check your server logs
[21:38:32] <shoky> etc.
[21:39:11] <l33n> ok ty
[21:40:15] <l33n> shoky, can i have the json like that?
[21:40:30] <shoky> l33n: not sure what you're asking?  if it's valid.. yea?
[21:40:33] <l33n> i want it to be an array of multiple arrays
[21:40:52] <l33n> how would i reference each of the elements after mapping them?
[21:40:53] <shoky> it's an array of one array currently
[21:41:06] <shoky> same as you do with any array
[21:41:14] <l33n> well i formatted the json to be like [[][][]]
[21:41:41] <shoky> ah sorry didn't notice that its 3 arrays there
[21:41:48] <l33n> ok
[21:42:03] <shoky> anyway so if hydrants is your parsed json obj
[21:42:10] <l33n> yeah
[21:42:11] <shoky> then hydrants[0] is the first array
[21:42:14] <l33n> ok
[21:42:32] <shoky> hydrants[0][0]  is the first item in that first array
[21:42:38] <l33n> ok
[21:42:39] <l33n> ty
[21:42:40] <shoky> but you only have one item in each array currently
[21:42:52] <shoky> so doesn't make much sense
[21:43:04] <l33n> i do?
[21:43:15] <shoky> [{"id":"1","address":"123 Main Street","distance":"50","flow_rate":"50","status":"1"}]
[21:43:21] <shoky> that's an array with one item
[21:43:39] <shoky> array of length 1
[21:44:01] <l33n> ok
[21:44:20] <shoky> so [{}, {}, {}]  would make more sense
[21:44:30] <shoky> than  [[{}], [{}], [{}]]
[21:46:01] <l33n> so i would put curly brackets around each element, like {"id":"1"} for example
[21:46:12] <shoky> hm?
[21:47:12] <l33n> [{"id":"1"},{"address":"123 Main Street"},{"distance":"50"},{"flow_rate":"50"},{"status":"1"}]
[21:48:50] <l33n> shoky would that be the [{}, {}, {}] you were talking about?
[22:00:30] <l33n> shoky, with the code you posted, would the onclick even be for the startAjax() function? i mean, would startAjax() onclick give the .done call too?
[22:05:27] <shoky> l33n no i meant [{"id":"1", "address":"123 Main Street", "distance":"50", ...}, {"id":"2", "address":...}, {...}]
[22:05:38] <shoky> an array with 3 objects
[22:06:10] <shoky> l33n: no idea what you asked last..  startAjax() is meant to be called in your click handler i guess
[22:06:38] <shoky> and you can attach .done() to it wherever you want
[22:07:06] <shoky> even later..  var request = startAjax(); .....  somewhere else:   request.done(...)
[22:07:06] <l33n> but calling startAjax() will that get the startAjax().done(function(hydrants)
[22:07:21] <shoky> startAjax() returns the ajax promise, yes
[22:07:25] <l33n> ok
[22:08:49] <l33n> if i want to have an array of 3 arrays would i format the json like [{"id":"1"},{"address":"123 Main Street"},{"distance":"50"},{"flow_rate":"50"},{"status":"1"}] for each []?
[22:09:12] <shoky> that doesn't make any sense
[22:09:17] <l33n> hm why
[22:09:22] <shoky> wrapping each key:value pair in its own object
[22:09:32] <shoky> an object can have many key:value pairs
[22:09:37] <l33n> ok
[22:09:40] <shoky> you want to have an array of hydrant objects
[22:09:45] <shoky> []  thats an array
[22:09:48] <shoky> {} thats an object
[22:09:58] <l33n> ok
[22:10:01] <shoky> {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}
[22:10:04] <shoky> that's one hydrant object
[22:10:18] <shoky> an array of 3 of those would be   [{"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}, {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}, {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}]
[22:10:30] <shoky> anything else wouldn't really make sense given your data
[22:11:06] <l33n> can i have an object that is a one key and an array?
[22:11:23] <shoky> you can but it doesn't make any sense
[22:11:25] <shoky> for your data.
[22:11:55] <l33n> i want it to be like, heres the id for the hydrant and that gives me a bunch of info related to that hydrant
[22:12:16] <shoky> ok so you want an object, not an array
[22:12:45] <shoky> {"1": {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}, "2": {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}, "3": {"id":.., "foo": "bar", ...}}
[22:12:59] <l33n> ah ok
[22:13:06] <shoky> then you can just do hydrants["1"] to get hydrant with id 1
[22:13:27] <shoky> and Object.keys(hydrants) to get all the keys/ids
[22:13:35] <shoky> (and iterate over them if you want)
[22:13:42] <shoky> (e.g. with .forEach )
[22:13:51] <l33n> ok
[22:16:43] <l33n> for(i=0, i<Object.keys(hydrants), i++) { hydrant[i].id.... } would that work
[22:17:45] <l33n> hydrant[""+i]
[22:23:00] <systemfault> Why would you use a for though?
[22:23:40] <systemfault> It makes you declare a counter and initialize it... makes you define a "end condition" and an increment...
[22:24:02] <systemfault> Object.keys(hydrants).forEach(function(hydrant) {})
[22:26:42] <l33n> ty systemfault
[22:34:06] <shoky> Object.keys(hydrants).forEach(function(id) { var hydrant = hydrants[id]; ... })
[22:41:36] <l33n> i need to do this first though right: startAjax().done(function(data) {
[22:41:36] <l33n>                  $.each(hydrants, function(i, item)
[22:41:52] <l33n> er startAjax().done(function(hydrants) {
[22:41:52] <l33n>                  $.each(hydrants, function(i, item)
[22:42:35] <l33n> otherwise there are no key values set up yet?
