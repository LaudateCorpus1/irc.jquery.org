[00:00:24] <ablegreen> Cork: Just tried it. it's as slow as setting async to false. that's right right?
[00:00:38] <Cork> yes
[00:00:49] <Cork> cause they wait for the response on each loop
[00:00:55] <Cork> just like sync would do
[00:01:33] <ablegreen> cork: that sucks!
[00:01:38] <Cork> :)
[00:01:59] <Cork> well if you want the response to update before the next loop, you will have to wait :)
[00:02:14] <Cork> there isn't really any other way around that
[00:03:48] <ablegreen> aw
[00:14:28] <jop008> my code is like this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/67/
[00:14:47] <jop008> but not precisely since the screen on production looks different
[00:24:15] <Cork> jop008: it's not possible to click the lv_options, it doesn't have a height
[00:24:50] <jop008> maybe I miss some css on the fiddle
[00:30:02] <jop008> Now I have an ul and li items
[00:30:31] <jop008> the idea is as follows genereate an html table and let users search on it since the list is long
[00:30:48] <jop008> On another page it is working
[00:30:51] <Tumulte> hey ! Line 7 I got a undifined variable "track" http://paste.debian.net/57278/
[00:31:03] <Tumulte> but only in the prod website, not locally
[00:37:03] <BrazenBraden> I am creating a div element with id using javascript which is meant to act like a button. on first click, it does nothing but if you click it a second time, then the associated ajax gets run and the page loaded. any idea why?
[00:38:02] <asd123> BrazenBraden: $(document).ready?
[00:38:30] <BrazenBraden> it is within a doc.ready block
[00:39:48] <BrazenBraden> i am also trying to set the html() of it so put in an icon but that never seems to run... lemme gist some code quick.
[00:42:02] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/c8c033163190ebcba2ad
[00:46:30] <jop008> Any reason why scrollintoview is not precise after the method I have to scroll one table row above to see the element
[00:49:53] <asd123> BrazenBraden: what do you want to achive?
[00:52:07] <BrazenBraden> asd123: when the page loads, i would like the #new_user_button div which is created via JS (using dataTables) to have an icon-plus and to respond on first click
[00:52:11] <asd123> jop008: any margins?
[00:52:19] <wathek> Hi everybody
[00:53:18] <asd123> does the creation work?
[00:53:50] <BrazenBraden> asd123: the creation does work. the div is there and the styling i have applied via CSS works straight from the get-go
[00:54:17] <asd123> is the div available on document ready?
[00:54:42] <wathek> I got a strange problem with my ajax call here's my code : http://pastebin.com/B4pKVgPZ and I don't understand why it never goes into the success function however the call is fine and it finishs with a 200 OK status code
[00:54:49] <wathek> am I missing something ?
[00:55:44] <BrazenBraden> asd123: that i am not sure about since it is being added in via JS so I am thinking it is not, and that is why i have a $(document).on('page:load') within the doc.ready block
[00:56:20] <asd123> hmm. what about inserting the div in the same function?
[00:56:52] <BrazenBraden> lemme add the code where i actually create the div into the gist.. might help
[00:57:51] <asd123> yes
[00:57:56] <BrazenBraden> asd123: gist has been updated
[00:58:09] <BrazenBraden> maybe i need to put the Setup() function up at the top before the rest?
[00:58:30] <asd123> try it...
[00:59:22] <BrazenBraden> asd123: ok, that did put the icon in. So the JS gets executed in order. Just learnt something. However, the click functionality still only happens on the second click
[00:59:27] <asd123> im not sure iof "page:load" is an event of the button div
[01:00:02] <asd123>  $(document).on('click', function(){
[01:00:02] <asd123> $('#new_user_button').on('click', function(){
[01:00:02] <asd123> // this only gets run on second click
[01:00:02] <asd123> $('#edit_users_container').load('users/new');
[01:00:02] <asd123> });
[01:00:02] <asd123> });
[01:00:14] <asd123> if you click on the document, it will add an event handler to the div
[01:00:22] <asd123> on the first click there is no action
[01:00:26] <asd123> only to the document
[01:00:44] <BrazenBraden> asd123: ok, so i should remove the doc.click bit?
[01:01:04] <asd123> $(document).on(click) fetches clicks to the document
[01:01:23] <asd123> and it will add the event listener to the div after the first click
[01:01:23] <wathek> any help with my problem ?
[01:01:34] <BrazenBraden> asd123: perfect
[01:01:46] <BrazenBraden> i moved the new_button segment out and it works straight away
[01:02:00] <asd123> what did you remove?
[01:02:11] <asd123> try to remove $(document).on('click', function(){
[01:02:20] <BrazenBraden> did "remove" just moved the button.click outside of the doc.click
[01:02:26] <jop008> just a table  with no margin.  Issue fixed by searching the prior element instead of the one selected
[01:02:34] <asd123> ah ok
[01:02:59] <BrazenBraden> asd123: i do have some other code inside the doc.click which works fine as it is
[01:03:07] <BrazenBraden> asd123: thanks a bunch
[01:03:12] <asd123> :)
[01:04:24] <asd123> wathek: whats the problem?
[01:04:43] <wathek> I got a strange problem with my ajax call here's my code : http://pastebin.com/B4pKVgPZ and I don't understand why it never goes into the success function however the call is fine and it finishs with a 200 OK status code
[01:05:21] <wathek> asd123, do you see anything wrong in my code ?
[01:06:06] <wathek> asd123, I think I found it
[01:06:24] <asd123> try that way $.ajax(...).done(function() {});
[01:07:05] <wathek> asd123, just one sec I think I found it
[01:07:09] <asd123> ok :)
[01:07:33] <wathek> asd123, I was doing an echo in an other place which make my json return string false
[01:07:44] <asd123> :)
[01:07:52] <wathek> thank you asd
[01:07:53] <wathek> thank you asd123
[01:08:20] <asd123> sure
[01:09:22] <asd123> want to give me some feedback on a responsive layout?
[01:13:34] <rved> hello, I'm working on a ASP.net website… which has all the content in 1 form… :( … now i want to validate a single field in a specific div… how can i do this with the jquery validate plugin?
[01:13:54] <rved> I'm only used to validate specific forms
[01:14:06] <rved> and not one huge form with the whole website inside
[01:14:30] <rved> i don't want to validate the entire form, cause then you can't submit… other fields will show messages
[01:25:31] <joobz> guys, i use setInterval() every second to update a second timer value on the page.. over a long period of having hte browser open, it seems to make the browser sluggish.. any ideas?
[01:31:25] <BillTheButcher_l> question: how do I target the first given attribute that is higher up in the dom hierarcy? not sure if I artuclated myself correctly but I hope you will understand
[01:32:02] <torbjorn> .closest() perhaps?
[01:34:02] <BillTheButcher_l> ty
[01:36:03] <kpl> Someone mentioned that id prop should not start with a number. Is that right? I'd like to only numeric chars for some ids.
[01:40:29] <Syrit> Guys,  i wrote some inline jQuery code, it became really long and cluttered, i want to DRY it, so, my question have 2 parts : 1- before DRYing it, i should write rspec test for that right? 2- should it go to Assest pipeline ?
[01:40:49] <Syrit> oh, it's wrong channel , sorry
[01:47:40] <malorie> I'm looking for a way to scale my text-size such that the text inside my div is as big as possible, but doesn't overflow height-, or width-wise. how'd I do that?
[01:51:47] <asd123> malorie: div: overflow:hidden
[01:53:06] <malorie> asd123: what?
[01:53:49] <asd123> malorie: what is the text size dependend on?
[01:54:35] <jop008> who has a good feeling of making attractive mobile websites. My site is (almost ready) but I like it a bit more "sexier"/ eye candy. Anyone?
[01:54:56] <asd123> have a link, jop008 ?
[01:55:17] <jop008> Site is this www.happyaway.nl and an important one is this http://www.happyaway.nl/search.htm
[01:55:23] <malorie> asd123: it should depend on the enclosing div. e.g., I have a div that's 1000px in height and 500px in width, and the text should fit in it as good as possible
[01:55:30] <jop008> A site for renting houses
[01:56:00] <jop008> Main focus france site must be made multi lingual but this I can do myself
[01:56:49] <jop008> I can pay for the work delivered
[01:57:20] <jop008> But I am a single developer without customers (yet)
[02:00:05] <malorie> asd123: the text also possibly has multiple lines, I should note
[02:00:32] <GreatPotato_> malorie: http://fittextjs.com/
[02:01:22] <malorie> GreatPotato_: isn't that only good for single lines?
[02:01:49] <GreatPotato_> Not sure, if so, modify it: https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js/blob/master/jquery.fittext.js
[02:02:24] <asd123> malorie: dirty way: loop the text-size
[02:02:43] <asd123> while text-height<div-height text-height++
[02:04:19] <malorie> asd123: in fact, I'm currently rolling my own, but it's quite non-trivial, since you have to meassure text-widths, keep track of the sizes, and take multiple lines into account. so I was hoping that there's already something out there :-)
[02:05:38] <asd123> why dont you put the text into another div and measure the size of that div?
[02:05:46] <asd123> because the new divs size depends on the text height
[02:05:51] <malorie> because of overflows and multiple lines
[02:05:59] <malorie> it just doesn't work that way, I found
[02:06:17] <asd123> jop008: no breakpoints at all?
[02:06:51] <jop008> breakpoints?
[02:07:38] <jop008> I know breakpoint from debugging ;-)
[02:07:40] <asd123> to be responsive?
[02:07:45] <asd123> css breakpoints
[02:07:50] <malorie> https://github.com/STRML/textFit this might work
[02:07:56] <asd123> its just optimized for small screens?
[02:08:19] <asd123> malorie: div with "style=overflow:hidden"
[02:08:32] <asd123> that fits to the text size
[02:08:39] <asd123> but you have to keep the text margins in mind
[02:09:06] <malorie> doesn't that just cut my text off?
[02:09:10] <asd123> nope
[02:09:13] <asd123> not with overflow:hidden
[02:09:22] <asd123> it is just for the inner div
[02:09:28] <asd123> not the div with static heights and widths
[02:09:51] <asd123> <div style="height:1000px; width:1000px;">
[02:09:51] <asd123> <div style="overflow:hidden">
[02:09:58] <asd123> this div contains text
[02:10:00] <asd123> </div></div>
[02:10:18] <asd123> the inner div should have the size of the text-(box)
[02:11:22] <asd123> and with that size you can loop the text size until it fits to the outer box
[02:12:06] <jop008> So that is one of the things to improve implementing bp but on the ipad the page is rendering nice (looking to the columns only)
[02:13:33] <malorie> asd123: and both divs should have position: absolute?
[02:14:04] <asd123> no
[02:14:13] <asd123> the inner div should probably have relative position
[02:14:27] <asd123> but it might not matter...
[02:15:04] <malorie> well, anything else than both having absolute positioning either cuts the text off, or lets the inner div inherit its parent's width
[02:15:54] <anli_> Can I reinit sortable for a set of divs? (when another div has been appended, for instance)
[02:16:46] <asd123> the inner div should inherit the height of the text
[02:16:53] <asd123> because you can get it that way easily
[02:23:57] <BillTheButcher_l> How is it possible that a row thats supposed to be deleted and the execute() function returns true still exists in the database? e.g delete from table where post_id = someNumber.
[02:24:04] <BillTheButcher_l> wops wrong channel
[02:28:13] <asd123> wrong mysql query Billthe...
[02:32:19] <asd123> malorie: did that help?
[02:38:38] <^^jqldn^^> hello there! I'm trying to build a lightbox with fancybox. So far everything works great but only a tiny detail. The "close" button (with a custom background image), is loading at first, and then the iframe and the content inside. Is there anyway to delay the appearing of this "close" button? Thanks in advance
[03:49:09] <malorie> asd123: unfortunatelly it didn't help, or I just couldn't get it to work. but I found a small script that does exactly what I want in a single line of code, so I'm all good now. also, appreciated your help :-)
[04:11:56] <asd123> ok
[04:17:46] <yellowfish> can someone recommend a simple IDE for javascripts?
[04:18:28] <Cork> yellowfish: you normally don't need an ide for js
[04:18:43] <Cork> you need an ide for the server language you use
[04:18:53] <Cork> (well if anything)
[04:19:22] <slax0r> need is a strong word in such statement
[04:19:34] <grafi> Cork code completion is pretty damn cool though
[04:19:36] <seutje> the browser is your IDE
[04:19:44] <seutje> or at least, mine
[04:19:52] <grafi> devtools seutje?
[04:19:54] <Cork> grafi: well that isn't an ide
[04:19:59] <grafi> the workspaces thingie
[04:20:17] <seutje> yeah man, sources tab for great power!
[04:20:18] <Cork> grafi: it's just an editor with word completion :)
[04:20:21] <grafi> you mean codecompletion is not part of an ide?
[04:20:22] <grafi> oô
[04:20:34] <Cork> grafi: well they have it too
[04:20:40] <Cork> but a lot of editors has it too
[04:21:02] <grafi> true
[04:21:03] <Cork> grafi: ide is for managing projects
[04:21:05] <seutje> sublime does  completion
[04:21:15] <seutje> by no means an IDE (or at least not out of the box)
[04:21:22] <Cork> and that normally means js isn't the only thing it needs to take into account
[04:21:38] <grafi> whatever, my point was "dont us ms word for writing your javascript", "use something that offers code completion at least"
[04:21:39] <grafi> :P
[04:21:42] <grafi> or something
[04:21:45] <seutje> when ur building JS strings in PHP... then u might wanna get an IDE to make sense of it all
[04:22:00] <seutje> cause I'm not going to :D
[04:22:05] <Cork> :)
[04:22:13] <grafi> xD
[04:22:22] <Cork> but ya, i would recommend sublime too
[04:22:36] <Cork> it is an inbetween of a plain editor and an ide
[04:23:03] <grafi> plugins galore
[04:23:16] <grafi> and it looks so nice :/
[04:27:44] <seutje> don't go too crazy on the plugins though
[04:27:52] <seutje> they can bring things to a halt if ur not careful
[04:32:50] <anli_> I want to have a list of tr:s sortable, each having a "handle" which is used for dragging a tr, is that possible with jquery sortable?
[04:33:02] <Cork> yes
[04:33:14] <anli_> Ah, I forgot to add "how" to the question
[04:33:24] <Cork> you will have to have a column for the handle
[04:33:30] <anli_> yeah, thats done
[04:33:32] <Cork> and specify that for the handle
[04:33:39] <Cork> the rest should just work
[04:33:42] <anli_> cool!
[04:33:43] <anli_> thanks
[04:49:26] <BrazenBraden> I am having a little issue with dataTables. The items listed in the table are attached to a click handler which loads a page when an item is clicked. This works fine for the first page but as soon as I paginate to another page, the click event is never fired or caught... any idea why?
[04:52:24] <BrazenBraden> all the table items have their id from the database so I know all the data is being loaded and from what I understand, all dataTables does is take the list and then hide / show numbers of items using the paginate stuff. technically, the entire list is available on the page.. right?
[04:57:33] <BrazenBraden> think i found teh answer
[04:59:23] <sekyms> Is there a way to get slider/#range to not allow the same start ad end values?
[05:00:09] <Cork> sekyms: check and handle it in the slide event
[05:00:20] <sekyms> yeah, ok
[05:00:26] <sekyms> wasn't sure if there was something built in
[05:01:05] <sekyms> Cork how do I get the values of min and max without slide?
[05:01:20] <Cork> without?
[05:01:32] <Cork> you send it to it when you initialize it
[05:01:37] <Cork> so you should already have it
[05:01:40] <sekyms> right I do
[05:01:56] <sekyms> oh i can use just update my name space variable on every slide
[05:02:00] <sekyms> and then use that on submit
[05:02:04] <sekyms> rather than querying it
[05:03:01] <sekyms> thanks cork
[05:03:05] <Cork> np
[05:05:02] <anli_> hm, when thinking about it, I am using .sortable on a table, that does not make trs sortable, does it...
[05:05:09] <anli_> Must do it on the trs, I suppose
[05:05:23] <anli_> Or using it on the tbody
[05:06:02] <anli_> tbody was the way
[05:09:20] <sekyms> event.preventDefault()
[05:09:21] <sekyms> duh
[05:09:26] <sekyms> sorry in my defense its 8:00 am
[05:09:42] <bberry> could i set up an ajax request like so...? http://jsfiddle.net/TyvZ9/
[05:10:41] <bberry> er, i guess ajax request doesnt make sense, but you get what i mean :P
[05:10:55] <seutje> bberry: sure, I suppose
[05:11:09] <Cork> bberry: it's success and error when you give it inline
[05:11:11] <Cork> except for that ya
[05:11:24] <bberry> oh, so not fail?
[05:11:44] <Cork> its .fail().done() or error: success:
[05:11:53] <seutje> fail and done are promise methods
[05:12:20] <bberry> okay
[05:12:24] <seutje> liek var xhr = $.ajax({...}); xhr.done(doneHandler).fail(failHandler);
[05:12:36] <bberry> yeah
[05:12:51] <seutje> it's the fancy new anti-spaghetti thing
[05:13:05] <seutje> but not to worry, spaghetti can still be made :D
[05:13:37] <bberry> :P
[05:13:46] <bberry> i feel like the way i set it up is more straightforward >.<
[05:16:31] <BrazenBraden> ok, it appears my "checkboxes" checked / unchecked values are controlled by something called 'Sizzle'. When "checking a checkbox", the html is not updated with the "checked" attribute. Anyone know how I go about getting all the checkboxes which are checked or unchecked for that matter?
[05:16:59] <BrazenBraden> I found the Sizzle documentation wiki but not making heads or tails of it
[05:20:45] <Thoams> 'ola
[05:21:36] <shoky> BrazenBraden: $('input[type=checkbox]').filter(':checked')  or .not(':checked')    would do it
[05:24:08] <BrazenBraden> thanks shoky, will give that a go
[05:25:39] <seutje> BrazenBraden: this is because most browsers will keep track of the property on the element, rather than the attribute on the markup
[05:25:53] <BrazenBraden> seutje: I see.. is this a new development?
[05:26:05] <seutje> the clear distinction between the 2 sorta is
[05:26:11] <seutje> as in, in jQuery land
[05:26:35] <Cork> well dom has always seen it as two different things
[05:26:45] <Cork> even way back in early dom era
[05:26:47] <BrazenBraden> I see
[05:26:53] <Cork> jquery tried to mask it for a while
[05:27:09] <shoky> also i wouldn't call jquery 1.6 too new ;p
[05:27:22] <BrazenBraden> i remember when i first started out with web dev, i used to reply on the on <input ckbox checked="checked"> stuff
[05:27:39] <seutje> yeah that's what I meant: the distinction in jQuery land is sorta new
[05:27:52] <Cork> BrazenBraden: but then you use elm.checked right?
[05:28:03] <BrazenBraden> so shoky, once i have filtered by say :checked, would i store the results in a var and then how do i go about 'unchecking' them?
[05:28:08] <Cork> cause that IS property not attribute
[05:28:10] <BrazenBraden> Cork: yea
[05:28:22] <BrazenBraden> oh
[05:28:22] <seutje> otherwise ud need el.getAttribute('checked')
[05:28:23] <shoky> BrazenBraden:  as simple as adding .prop('checked', false)   at the end
[05:28:29] <Cork> BrazenBraden: attr in jquery is getAtribute/setAttribute
[05:28:30] <seutje> then it  would return 'checked' instead of true :)
[05:28:39] <Cork> prop is the same as elm.<name>
[05:28:41] <BrazenBraden> Cork: but attr is depreicated
[05:28:43] <Cork> no
[05:28:44] <shoky> BrazenBraden e.g.   $('input[type=checkbox]').filter(':checked').prop('checked', false)
[05:28:46] <seutje> no it ain't
[05:28:55] <Cork> attr is for handling attributes
[05:28:55] <BrazenBraden> shoky: thanks.. trying it now
[05:29:03] <Cork> and prop is for properties
[05:29:40] <BrazenBraden> Cork: oh.. from what i have been reading, everyone says to use prop instead of attr these days
[05:29:45] <shoky> using attr to set properties is what's "deprecated"
[05:29:46] <Cork> and when ppl run none jquery they normally only use properties
[05:29:50] <seutje> depends what ur doing
[05:30:00] <Cork> well it isn't deprecated, it is removed
[05:30:02] <seutje> usually, yeah
[05:30:09] <Cork> as it has been split out into prop
[05:30:13] <seutje> always, no
[05:30:37] <BrazenBraden> hmm so much to learn!
[05:30:38] <Cork> BrazenBraden: yes, cause like i said, most ppl wants to use properties, and not attr
[05:30:56] <Cork> but ex. if you want the url that was actually entered into a link
[05:30:56] <mdev> can jquery not click a span by id?
[05:31:00] <mdev> does it have to be a div or class?
[05:31:01] <Cork> you want attr instead of prop
[05:31:05] <Leo2013jkhjhj> Hello i need Help with some Jquery conflict Problem but i am absolute newbie in it - can someone take a look ?
[05:31:12] <seutje> mdev: sry, what?
[05:31:14] <seutje> $(
[05:31:16] <Cork> mdev: no it should work fine
[05:31:21] <mdev> ugh
[05:31:45] <Cork> mdev: there is just a very few special elements you can't do click on
[05:31:59] <seutje> oh u mean trigger?
[05:32:03] <seutje> like file input on safaries?
[05:32:27] <Cork> seutje: $('#id_of_span').click();
[05:32:35] <Cheery> I'm working on custom document object model, and I would like about little help there.
[05:32:39] <Cheery> http://bpaste.net/show/2Vp1vH8ONjAvt7DJdSpO/
[05:32:46] <Cork> mdev: though remember that an id can only exist on one element
[05:32:47] <seutje> I hate .click()
[05:32:55] <Cheery> I wonder how to implement jquery-style query into that.
[05:32:57] <Cork> mdev: you can't have it on more then one element
[05:33:15] <Cork> seutje: well ya, i use trigger too, but... :)
[05:33:22] <Cheery> doesn't need to be full css selector syntax. mostly just ' ', '>', '+'
[05:33:31] <Cork> ?ask @ Leo2013jkhjhj
[05:33:31] <b-ot> Leo2013jkhjhj: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:33:33] <seutje> Cork: .submit() is the worst :P
[05:33:37] <Cheery> if and text search maybe
[05:33:42] <seutje> or no, load
[05:34:04] <seutje> it binds a handler, triggers handlers and ajaxes content!
[05:34:06] <Cheery> if I get the parsing correct, I'd probably get the rest right.
[05:34:26] <Cork> seutje: you mean $().submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault() ... this.submit(); }).submit(); ? XDD
[05:34:33] <seutje> :P
[05:34:41] <seutje> yeah, load is worse
[05:34:48] <Cork> that is one nasty hair ball..
[05:34:57] <Cork> ya, i hate load
[05:35:13] <Cork> especially with it's selector in string thingy....
[05:37:03] <Leo2013jkhjhj> The Problem is .. i cant get running my newsletter subscribe .. because when i put 1 js in my html the other things dont run anymore like twitter .. the Link is: http://magentoecommerce.de/test.html this site got the js/jquery.js in the footer if i take it out my twitter runs - same problem is with sliders and everything else that is in the js/custom.js - Can some1 take a look where is the bug ? i dont know what
[05:37:03] <Leo2013jkhjhj>  i can do anymore ... i am absolut newbie in jquery // Java Script
[05:39:07] <seutje> Leo2013jkhjhj: you're loading 2 different versions of jQuery
[05:39:22] <seutje> u have a 1.9.1 minified at first
[05:39:26] <BrazenBraden> almost all works :) except for one minor thing... it seems that when i click a checkbox, the event handling that gets called twice for some reason
[05:39:33] <seutje> and like 20 scripts later, u add a 1.9.0 unminified
[05:39:57] <BrazenBraden> looking at the "checked" value of the checkbox, first time it is 'undefined', second time, true ( or false )
[05:40:20] <Leo2013jkhjhj> seutje: How can i change that .. that i can run both newsletter and others
[05:40:46] <DRSK> How can I force "preloading" a couple of images? I'm changing the src value <img src="val1" data-something="val2" /> but it flickers if val2 isn't loaded.
[05:40:46] <Cork> BrazenBraden: prop('checked') should only be true of false
[05:41:07] <Cork> ?g javascript image preload
[05:41:08] <b-ot> Cork: 3+ Ways to Preload Images Using CSS, JavaScript, or Ajax ... → http://perishablepress.com/3-ways-preload-images-css-javascript-ajax/
[05:41:18] <BrazenBraden> Cork: I know.. but the event is firing twice. clearly once before the prop gets set so it is undefined.\
[05:41:35] <BrazenBraden> Cork: will throw together some of the code..
[05:41:37] <Cork> BrazenBraden: what event?
[05:41:50] <BrazenBraden> on('click
[05:42:04] <seutje> Leo2013jkhjhj: stick to one, so plugins don't get declared on one and called on the other
[05:42:27] <Leo2013jkhjhj> seutje: Sorry - how do u mean that?
[05:43:07] <BrazenBraden> Cork: https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/4163248a96a81c159aae
[05:43:27] <seutje> Leo2013jkhjhj: for instance: jQuery(document).ready(function($) { jQuery("#tweets-footer").tweet({ // <- $.fn.jquery = 1.9.1, jQuery.fn.jquery = 1.9.0, $.fn.tweet = fn, jQuery.fn.tweet = undefined
[05:43:34] <seutje> (in social options.js
[05:43:36] <Cork> BrazenBraden: use this instead of target
[05:43:44] <BrazenBraden> k
[05:43:46] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you might get the label if you use e.target
[05:44:55] <seutje> yeah, e.target is the actual target of the event (could point to a child of what you bound it to), whereas this is always mapped to the element you bound it to
[05:45:16] <Cork> or a related target that can trigger it
[05:45:30] <Thoams> anyone quickly tell me the correct parameters for $.ajax error functions?
[05:45:30] <Cork> like <label>something <input></label>
[05:45:35] <Cork> or label for="id"
[05:45:45] <Thoams> I know there's three of them but I end up using pretty much whatever letters take my fancy
[05:45:50] <Thoams> the first one is event :D
[05:45:52] <Cork> Thoams: check api.jquery.com
[05:45:53] <Leo2013jkhjhj> Seutje: Sorry i am really not the pro in jquery - dont know what do u mean
[05:45:58] <Thoams> yeah, was asking quickly
[05:46:01] <Cork> ?api ajax
[05:46:01] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[05:46:03] <BrazenBraden> Cork: changing from target to this is preventing my if else from switching..
[05:46:07] <Thoams> can't really be arsed >.<
[05:46:47] <BrazenBraden> Cork: will update my gist with the html for the list items
[05:46:50] <Cork> BrazenBraden: is user_list_item on the checkbox or the label?
[05:47:26] <BrazenBraden> Cork: updated
[05:47:43] <BrazenBraden> Cork: user_list_item is on the td
[05:47:49] <Cork> uh
[05:48:02] <Cork> then there is you problem
[05:48:27] <Cork> change '.user_list_item' to '.use_list_item input'
[05:48:28] <BrazenBraden> each td element has a tonne of stuff in it..
[05:48:58] <Cork> or even patter '.user_list_item .switch-input'
[05:49:01] <Cork> *better
[05:49:23] <BrazenBraden> i want to be able to click either on checkbox or the other stuff in the td and have two different things happen
[05:49:55] <BrazenBraden> by adding the .switch-input i will lose the capture for the rest of the stuff in the td no?
[05:50:06] <Cork> well then you will have to check what e.target is and from $(this) find the checkbox
[05:50:18] <Cork> assuming that e.target is the checkbox won't work
[05:50:43] <BrazenBraden> I see
[05:53:34] <sylflo> hi
[05:55:12] <seutje> Leo2013jkhjhj: you load X and Y, you declare Z on X and then call it on Y... pretty much
[05:55:44] <Leo2013jkhjhj> :( seutje - so s a lot wrong ?
[05:55:57] <seutje> just don't load it twice
[05:56:12] <seutje> should be fine then, as it's all on the same variable that way
[05:56:19] <seutje> or rather, the same referenced object
[05:57:20] <Leo2013jkhjhj> okay ... i will try
[05:57:25] <ph88> hey i'm doing this post ... http://pastebin.com/eN9q65gd  ... but i receive this on serverside: array (   'undefined' => '', )  what's going on ?
[05:58:04] <anli_> Hm, how do I enable the traditional alert in firefox?
[05:58:08] <DevAntoine> hi
[05:58:20] <Cork> anli_: you can't
[05:58:29] <Cork> alert() is all that is available
[05:58:29] <anli_> They made it impossible?
[05:58:32] <seutje> wait what? moz killed it?
[05:58:32] <DevAntoine> I have a form with two button of type "submit". I intercept the submit event on the form but how can I know which button was clicked?
[05:58:44] <Cork> anli_: they replaced it with the new inline one
[05:58:45] <anli_> Cork: Well, its still alert(), just that I want the old gui
[05:58:55] <Cork> and there isn't one
[05:58:59] <Cork> like i said
[05:59:00] <anli_> They had a about:config setting so I could get the old one back
[05:59:13] <BrazenBraden> Cork: updated the gist to include what e.target returns when i click on things within the td. I tried changing from to $(this) and hacked around a bit but i cant get back the functionality i have so far
[05:59:20] <anli_> Maybe there is a plugin for getting another box than this
[05:59:33] <seutje> ph88: post expects data to be a string or an object
[05:59:34] <anli_> I cannot even change the position of it
[05:59:46] <Cork> anli_: why do you want the alert that badly?
[05:59:52] <ph88> seutje: i can not send an array as json ?
[05:59:56] <anli_> That badly is your interpretation
[06:00:00] <seutje> well, u never had any control over the UI of alert
[06:00:06] <seutje> was always up to the implementor
[06:00:19] <anli_> seutje: It was at least possible to drag it away
[06:00:19] <Cork> anli_: well i mean i don't care how the alert looks like cause it rarely ever see it
[06:00:30] <seutje> just make a div and style it like an alert box
[06:00:35] <anli_> I still think the old one is nicer
[06:00:44] <seutje> grab the UA string, parse the OS and make a wild guess on their theme settings :D
[06:01:00] <Cork> anli_: except it was severely broken
[06:01:09] <anli_> how?
[06:01:11] <Cork> it was very easy to hang the ui through it
[06:01:19] <ph88> how can i send this with post ?   ["120", "121"]
[06:01:23] <anli_> There is a close box in that box as well
[06:01:29] <Cork> it blocked a window that wasn't the one with the page that did the alert
[06:01:31] <Cork> and what not
[06:01:41] <seutje> ph88: wrap it in an object and give it a key u can target on the backend
[06:01:43] <anli_> The new one is modal, thats also blocking
[06:01:50] <Cork> anli_: and that x and the ok does the exact same thing
[06:01:54] <seutje> like {mydataz: ['120', '121']}
[06:01:58] <ph88> :|
[06:02:12] <seutje> ph88: or make ur own urlencoded shizmadiz
[06:02:18] <ph88> lol :p
[06:02:20] <seutje> like it says, string or object
[06:02:39] <ph88> well what if i send  ["120", "121"]  as string ?
[06:02:42] <ph88> how would i do that ?
[06:02:46] <seutje> it'll parse my example as mydataz[]=120&mydataz[]=121, I think
[06:03:20] <anli_> I falsified the statement that you cannot get the old alert box back
[06:03:32] <Cork> or { json: JSON.stringify(["120", "121"]) }
[06:03:39] <anli_> prompts.tab_model.enabled false
[06:03:40] <ph88> oh actually, seutje ..
[06:03:42] <ph88> i am silly
[06:03:45] <ph88> i do need a key anyway :D
[06:03:47] <anli_> modal, not model
[06:03:50] <ph88> ok thx for help
[06:03:55] <DevAntoine> nobody knows how to get the clicked button which submitted the form in a submit listener?
[06:04:26] <seutje> DevAntoine: thing is, spec doesn't specify it to matter
[06:04:27] <Cork> DevAntoine: you can't cross browser
[06:04:48] <seutje> DevAntoine: so u'll have to put a click handler on the buttons to register which one was clicked and then get that ref in the submit handler
[06:05:02] <seutje> it's awkward, I know
[06:05:18] <DevAntoine> how am I suppose to put that ref in the submit handler?
[06:05:19] <Cork> well try to get mozillas solution into the spec :)
[06:05:43] <Cork> DevAntoine: store it as a .data() on the form for example
[06:06:20] <Cork> and yes it is silly that plain form can differentiate the buttons but js can't
[06:06:30] <DRSK> Cork » the preloading techniques you linked are a bit over the top for this specific task. What if I just create the image elements after load and remove them? i.e. something like $( '<img/>' ).attr( 'src', imgURL ).remove(); ?
[06:07:00] <DevAntoine> ok, thanks Cork  and seutje
[06:07:07] <Cork> DRSK: that should be aprox what those script does
[06:07:18] <Cork> DRSK: except you need to wait for .load on them
[06:07:21] <DRSK> Worth adding might be it's 6 images in total, so a few millisecs here and there
[06:07:30] <Cork> else you will remove them before the source is requested
[06:07:43] <DRSK> We talking about document load?
[06:07:47] <Cork> no
[06:08:08] <DRSK> Right, so on window load I create and remove the images needed later on
[06:08:19] <DRSK> That was supposed to be a question ;p
[06:08:41] <BrazenBraden> Cork: it looks like i must use e.target otherwise I get the entire td element which does not allow me to distinguish between clicking on the checkbox or the other content inside the td
[06:08:41] <Cork> DRSK: var img = new Image(); img.onload = function() { img.parentNode.removeChild(img); }; img.src = preload;
[06:08:57] <Cork> BrazenBraden: yes, cause you bind the event to target the td
[06:09:17] <Cork> BrazenBraden: and if you do that you will have to do the calculations to find the correct element your self
[06:09:51] <Cork> as e.target will give you the clicked element, not the one that you listen for
[06:10:01] <anli_> Up to some firefox update, I had a working error console...
[06:10:02] <Cork> like ex. label instead of the input
[06:10:16] <Cork> anli_: error console works fine here
[06:10:19] <anli_> ah, cool
[06:10:25] <BrazenBraden> Cork: but both the label and the input are essentially one and the same thing
[06:10:28] <anli_> You are not talking about the firebug console?
[06:10:41] <Cork> anli_: ctrl+shift+k
[06:10:49] <BrazenBraden> the actual checkbox is hidden and the label is what is used to represent it (it is one of these fancy looking checkboxes from a template)
[06:10:51] <Cork> BrazenBraden: no they arn't
[06:11:02] <anli_> I use ctrl-shift-j, but ok, that one
[06:11:02] <Cork> BrazenBraden: cause the label doesn't have a checked state
[06:11:08] <DRSK> Cork » almost got it, the last part "img.src = preload;" what do you mean I should do ?
[06:11:10] <anli_> Its blank for me
[06:11:24] <Cork> DRSK: that is what should be the url you want to load
[06:11:47] <BrazenBraden> Cork: but if i know the label is the event then the checkbox is just a .childrens() away?
[06:12:01] <Cork> anli_: then you have done something to break things
[06:12:16] <anli_> I dont think so
[06:12:17] <Cork> anli_: make sure your firebug is up to date, and that you don't have anything else messing with things
[06:12:26] <Cork> well it is broken for you so...
[06:12:48] <anli_> Cork: yes, it is broken for me, but I dont think I have done anything special
[06:12:56] <anli_> I try to update
[06:13:03] <Cork> well you have something locally that breaks things
[06:13:05] <anli_> If not updating is anything special ;)
[06:13:24] <Cork> and... this is offtopic for this channel
[06:13:35] <Cork> #firefox <--
[06:24:31] <seutje> DevAntoine: sorry, was caught in a meeting, example: http://jsfiddle.net/8HASZ/
[06:25:07] <seutje> (note the keydown for ppl who tab and hit space)
[06:25:29] <seutje> also note that it won't catch any button when the user hits return in a textfield
[06:25:50] <seutje> so ur prolly best off providing a default
[06:26:04] <seutje> like "if the data thing is empty, use the first button encountered" or something
[06:26:15] <seutje> (that's what most browsers sorta kinda do anyway)
[06:27:32] <BrazenBraden> $(e.target) is my :checkbox. when doing $(e.target).prop('checked') i get true no matter what. I would like to be able to check the box true or check it again to false
[06:28:07] <DevAntoine> seutje: ok, thanks. That's such a shame to have to write something like this :/
[06:29:01] <seutje> DevAntoine: browsers don't really care about what button was pressed
[06:29:12] <seutje> you should see the crazy shit Drupal does to detect this on the backend
[06:29:17] <seutje> infinitely worse
[06:30:08] <DevAntoine> I didn't look at symfony's code but it does that to
[06:30:20] <DevAntoine> s/to/too
[06:35:24] <BrazenBraden> am i doing the if / else on checkbox status properly? https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/4163248a96a81c159aae
[06:36:10] <Cork> ya
[06:36:15] <Cork> you could inline it though
[06:36:45] <Cork> $(e.target).prop('checked', !$(e.target).prop('checked')); $(this).toggleClass('active', $(e.target).prop('checked'))
[06:37:15] <Cork> (and you most likely want a variable for $(e.target)
[06:37:26] <Cork> same for $(this)
[06:37:27] <Thoams> err... sortable's receive event, ui.placeholder.index() is -1 ?
[06:39:59] <BrazenBraden> Cork:  but $(e.target) is always true
[06:40:27] <Cork> BrazenBraden: then something is breaking
[06:40:43] <BrazenBraden> Cork: perhaps I should build more pylons
[06:41:42] <Thoams> You must construct additional pylons!
[06:41:53] <anli_> lol
[06:42:24] * BrazenBraden builds more pylons
[06:42:35] * anli_ is under attack
[06:42:58] * Thoams 's life for Aiur!
[06:44:51] <Cork> BrazenBraden: http://jsfiddle.net/pY7K9/
[06:46:06] <BrazenBraden> Cork: ok... am i not supposed to de-check the checkbox?
[06:46:07] <Cork> aaand one that's actually correct too http://jsfiddle.net/pY7K9/1/
[06:46:15] <BrazenBraden> lol
[06:46:23] <Cork> BrazenBraden: the browser does it by default
[06:46:28] <Cork> why would you need to?
[06:47:01] <BrazenBraden> wait a sec, just absorbing your example
[06:47:18] <BrazenBraden> arent self and parent reserved words?
[06:47:22] <seutje> isn't the label behavior implied?
[06:47:40] <Cork> seutje: label behavior?
[06:47:52] <seutje> yeha, licking on a label triggers the input
[06:47:55] <seutje> clicking as well
[06:48:01] <Cork> seutje: check again :)
[06:48:11] <Cork> the test is to exclude those two elements
[06:48:12] <BrazenBraden> ahh thats my problems, dont think i have been licking my labels properly
[06:48:29] <anli_> cb.prop('checked', false);
[06:48:35] <Cork> BrazenBraden: <label><input></label> is valid too
[06:48:42] <Cork> BrazenBraden: i just don't like mixing them
[06:48:43] <seutje> oooh
[06:49:00] <BrazenBraden> Cork: I dont usually but thats how this template rolls
[06:49:06] <BrazenBraden> i can show you it if you like
[06:49:16] <Cork> na
[06:49:36] <seutje> well, u could just set the label to display block and u would need a div or js
[06:49:43] <Cork> yup
[06:50:02] <Cork> except if you use a table it wouldn't really work
[06:50:11] <Cork> (and this is one of the reasons why you shouldn'
[06:50:18] <Cork> *'t use tables for layout
[06:50:30] <seutje> no wait, :active doesn't stay
[06:50:35] <seutje> and u can't go up the tree
[06:50:47] <Cork> seutje: :checked
[06:50:56] <seutje> nah, targetting the label
[06:51:04] <seutje> like http://jsfiddle.net/pY7K9/2/

[06:53:00] <seutje> Cork: sure, but I prefet wrapping my checkboxed in the label
[06:53:12] <seutje> removed the need for for attribute and then the styling also wraps it
[06:53:16] <Cork> then you can't css to style it :)
[06:53:21] <seutje> truth
[06:53:32] <Cork> (a second reason why i like for="")
[06:53:40] <M3kH> Hi all!
[06:53:45] <seutje> unless... no wait, inputs don't support pseudos :(
[06:54:09] <seutje> when in doubt, I always go for psuedos
[06:54:17] <seutje> helps my coworkers debug it later on :D

[07:05:01] <prx> Hey, I'd like to disable a hyperlink inside a wordpress website, does anyone have an idea how i could do it?
[07:15:23] <bberry> Lets assume i have an array of objects, where each object has a "name" property.  Is there a simple to get these into a comma-delimited string?
[07:16:07] <bberry> i could do it manually by getting the object name and appending it to the string, but i wasnt sure if there was already something like this built-in
[07:30:29] <lasha> I RAN TOUGH MUDDER YESTERDAY
[07:45:30] <freannrak> how do I check if this element equals to to [] $('#sportsChart'); --> output []
[07:45:54] <freannrak> i've tried if($('#sportsChart') === []) console.log('true');
[07:51:43] <freannrak> nevermind, so stupid...
[08:01:53] <heny`> hello, got a question: i have a collapsible menu which i want to restore its state after page refreshing. i use the cookie plugin for it and it works just fine. the only problem is that the menu flashes for a tiny bit after loading the page. i already tried to hide the whole body before the DOM ready but that way the whole page flashes white on loa
[08:01:53] <heny`> d. is there a way to tackle that problem?
[08:13:04] <dan89> hello, is anyone familiar with gamequery? I'm trying to run an animation once, pause for a moment on the last frame and then run a callback to switch to another frame, can't seem to figure out how to do this though, can anyone help?
[08:15:08] <Idealien> Having a rather odd IE issue in http://irspm2014.com/sppa/index.php/irspm2014/IRSPM2014/schedConf/trackPolicies  The source has 50 divs which match $("#conferencePanelList > div") but in IE8 that only returns 10.
[08:16:02] <Idealien> Even if I do not apply the jQueryUI accordion to them - only 10 show up, but when i view source I know there are 50 (C1 is last that shows on page). Any ideas what would cause such behaviour that does not affect Chrome, FF or IE9+
[08:34:49] <rmah> has anyone worked with cssHooks?
[08:48:21] <jsc802> i have an ajax jsonp request that works on an http page but not an https page
[08:48:40] <jsc802> i tried changing it to .getJSON with ?callback= in the URL but it still doesnt work
[08:48:41] <jsc802> is this a known bug
[08:48:43] <bberry> wow....i just discovered jquery ui...
[08:51:47] <shoky> mankind will forever be in your debt
[08:52:17] <regedit> is there some framework/function that can take a stylesheet (css file) and apply it using jquery, enabling newer css features/selectors in older browsers?
[08:53:18] <regedit> something like - on document ready, apply css using jquery
[08:56:24] <boze> if I add a link with append, will a already created click listener in a document ready work on it? or do i have to add another event listener after adding the link?
[08:57:24] <thaifood> hi
[08:57:50] <shoky> boze: if the click listener was not delegated to a static container element then it won't work for new elements
[08:58:33] <Enekoos> hello, I try get a value clicked in select items but no work, any know what is my error? the alert work but not say te correct value $('nav>select').click(function(){             alert($(this).val);
[08:58:56] <shoky> boze: read about event delegation in .on() docs. example:  $('#container').on('click', '.myLinkClass', function(){...})
[08:58:59] <thaifood> How do i access the value for site_ID in this please ?    var myData = {"site_ID":"3","site_abbrev":"test","site":"tester"};
[08:59:13] <boze> shoky: tyvm <3 very helpful!
[09:00:19] <shoky> Enekoos:  this.value or $(this).val()
[09:00:39] <Enekoos> ohh need some () thanks noob error
[09:00:53] <mo_roodi> thaifood: myData["site_ID"] should do the trick
[09:01:10] <shoky> myData.site_ID as well
[09:01:15] <rmah> regedit: coincidentally, I'm looking at that too right now
[09:01:37] <rmah> regedit: I think $.cssHooks will do the trick
[09:01:39] <regedit> rmah: found something called "css3pie"
[09:01:41] <rmah> but it's a bit confusing
[09:01:52] <thaifood> shoky,  that gives me undefined
[09:02:08] <maxmoore14> anybody use http://www.photoswipe.com/ ? like it? hate it?
[09:02:33] <shoky> thaifood: maybe it is. make a jsfiddle if you want more help with it
[09:02:44] <maxmoore14> looking for something to easily add some app screenshots to my site
[09:03:08] <regedit> rmah: the goal would be to write css3 as usual, in the style sheets (not in js/jquery) and have it work in older browsers possibly by way of jquery selectors
[09:03:15] <thaifood> k
[09:03:20] <rmah> regedit: oh, that's different
[09:04:01] <rmah> regedit: does css3pie support transforms?
[09:04:10] <rmah> specifically rotations?
[09:05:21] <thaifood> http://jsfiddle.net/fRv3P/  doesn't seem to run
[09:06:15] <thaifood> added jquery  http://jsfiddle.net/fRv3P/1/
[09:06:23] <regedit> rmah: doesn't seem so... http://css3pie.com/documentation/supported-css3-features/
[09:06:52] <rmah> regedit: bummer
[09:06:58] <regedit> rmah: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9612190/css-rotate-ie7-and-8
[09:07:54] <Enekoos> this not work in android devices? $('nav>select').on('change', function (e) {
[09:07:58] <thaifood> ok i got it up to the json string  http://jsfiddle.net/fRv3P/4/
[09:08:11] <thaifood> now it need to just return the value in site_ID
[09:08:40] <jnewt> i'm trying to figure out how to start a timed ajax update.  when a user submits a form via POST, i need to start pulling status data from the server until some certain stati occur, then stop.  i'm already loading the form.html via ajax, but beyond that, i can't come up with a plan of attack
[09:09:23] <thaifood> see how line 6 gives me undefined ?  http://jsfiddle.net/fRv3P/6/
[09:10:52] <mo_roodi> json.stringify convert the json to a string which means that jsonData is just a string rather than a json object. var site_ID = jsonData.site_ID should actually be: var site_ID = myData.site_ID
[09:11:19] <DevAntoine> is there some jqGrid experts out there?
[09:11:31] <thaifood> thanks mo_roodi
[09:12:24] <thaifood> works great,  thanks again
[09:14:08] <mo_roodi> no problems :)
[09:16:20] <ericx3x> hey guys what is a custom variable for google analytics?
[09:16:44] <boze> shoky: that looked like the solution i was going for, but its a drupal site which uses jquery 1.4.4 and .on() didn't come out til 1.7 it seems...
[09:23:44] <thaifood> How do i set the value of an input box in a form "FrmGrid_detail1"  with input box ID  site_ID  please ?
[09:24:28] <thaifood> like this?      $("#site_ID", "FrmGrid_detail1").val(site_ID);
[09:24:43] <ericx3x> My client is asking to make sure Event Tracking, and custom variable code is added to this website I'm developing
[09:24:43] <ericx3x> I'm not quite sure what they mean
[09:24:43] <ericx3x> I have this google analytics script in the site but nothing more than that.
[09:25:09] <thaifood> hmm that doesn't do it
[09:25:29] <thaifood> alert(site_ID);  shows the value though
[09:25:53] <AdamPDotty> and it is the id of the input?
[09:25:59] <thaifood> yes
[09:26:05] <thaifood> per firebug inspector
[09:26:47] <AdamPDotty> so like:  $("#FrmGrid_detail1 #" + site_ID).val(site_ID);
[09:28:41] <thaifood> this works !  thanks   $("#FrmGrid_detail1 #site_ID").val(site_ID);
[09:28:49] <thaifood> great peeps here
[09:28:56] <AdamPDotty> fine
[09:34:37] <shoky> boze: then use .delegate instead, just switch the order of the 2 first arguments
[09:35:22] <boze> shoky: thank you
[09:38:11] <bberry> do we ask jquery ui questions here?
[09:41:15] <boze> shoky: awesome it works!
[09:46:37] <shoky> bberry ye
[09:50:28] <jop008> How can I empty a selectmenu field
[09:50:46] <jop008> I want to populate it with new items
[10:23:02] <wc-> i have to come up with a good interface for a user to propose available times on certain days of the week and another user to choose one of the available times.  any suggestions on a jquery plugin or something to do this?
[10:52:34] <bberry> hey guys.  im trying to do some css stuff with jquery UI. here the example. http://jsfiddle.net/wsYJy/ When the user drags from one list to the other, i would like the color of the element to change.  Can i accomplish this w/ jquery ui?
[10:53:47] <bberry> maybe i could use this? http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive
[10:55:25] <bberry> nevermind, i found a jsfiddle that solves my problem
[10:56:29] <MarkusDBX> Which is the most semantically correct tag, to use for buttons triggering query scripts i an ajax navigation-menu?
[10:56:46] <MarkusDBX> You can use any tag, but which is the most correct?
[11:07:53] <dachi> hello. somebody please tell me if following code is valid. It works, but still. http://jsbin.com/uPeBuCa/1/edit
[11:07:57] <dachi> thanks a lot people.

[12:06:33] <adoming> hey guys I have a ajax toggle button.  I can click once and it sends ajax POST but cannot reclick the button to toggle on success. http://pastebin.com/sjQVVV1t
[12:44:47] <naprac> how do i make a list-image only to those elements which has ul ie. a nested list?
[13:17:05] <jcooper> hi im trying to get the server date by doing an ajax request and reading the header
[13:17:28] <jcooper> this code works but not on a page that is https
[13:17:29] <jcooper> $.ajax('/', { type: 'HEAD',success: function(r,status,xhr) { console.log(xhr.getResponseHeader); } });
[13:26:22] <Richhh> after the fading of ie8, are there still browser inconsistencies to worry about, that jQuery will be relevant for?
[13:27:07] <vladikoff> Richhh, yes
[13:27:52] <vladikoff> Richhh, just IE10 and IE11 will have enough stuff for you, and then Blink vs Webkit :D
[13:35:35] <Richhh> blink sounds impressive
[13:36:11] <Richhh> i hope 90%+ will have moved to a super fast google browser within a few years
[13:37:34] <LoneSoldier728> hey so I was just wondering, if backbone is to SPA, what is a good framework
[13:37:34] <LoneSoldier728> to learn for non spa
[13:40:33] <JesseC> What's the best way to get the inverse of a selector? An example would be if a button is clicked, how do you get the one's that were not clicked.
[13:40:48] <JesseC> I guess the inverse of $(this)
[13:41:58] <JesseC> An example: http://jsfiddle.net/6c9p5/ How would you get which buttons aren't clicked.
[13:44:32] <JesseC> nm, think I got it
[14:00:12] <ItsHandicapable> join #c
[14:10:00] <boze> I'm opening and closing some divs with animate(height) which works great, but how come it scrolls to the very top of the page before each animation?
[14:10:34] <boze> maybe scrolls is the wrong word... "goes" to the top of the page
[14:11:20] <unnu> boze, you wanna throw a fiddle up?
[14:13:03] <boze> herm okay I'll check back later gana take a while :P
[14:40:44] <defaultro> something is just so wrong, even some folks at #css is shocked. :) I can't get the string to be right justified, http://jsfiddle.net/Y5kXb/14/
[14:41:02] <defaultro> any ideas folks?
[14:43:09] <rmah> defaultro: fixed for you
[14:43:17] <defaultro> oh, what was wrong?
[14:43:22] <rmah> you need to set display: inline-block and width: 50% for the label
[14:43:29] <rmah> without inline-block, no width takes hold
[14:43:52] <defaultro> can you please paste me the link?
[14:43:57] <rmah> same link
[14:44:00] <defaultro> k
[14:44:15] <defaultro> you need to click Update
[14:44:21] <rmah> I did
[14:44:25] <defaultro> maybe it's 15?
[14:44:33] <rmah> sorry, yes
[14:44:34] <defaultro> yeah, i see 15
[14:44:34] <defaultro> :D
[14:44:36] <rmah> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5kXb/15/
[14:44:59] <defaultro> why is it that this worked? http://jsfiddle.net/cSuuS/1/
[14:46:10] <rmah> defaultro: because float: left
[14:46:38] <defaultro> what was really happening?
[14:46:49] <rmah> I think float: left changes the display to be block
[14:47:05] <rmah> so the width 50% will apply to both
[14:47:14] <rmah> and thus, the text-align will work
[14:47:24] <defaultro> got it
[14:47:25] <defaultro> ;)
[14:47:52] <rmah> personally, I think it's annoying that label isn't inline-block by default
[14:48:49] <defaultro> am I doing it right though? Should I be using label to display the username?
[14:49:01] <rmah> no
[14:49:16] <defaultro> what should it be?
[14:49:23] <rmah> something else
[14:49:55] <defaultro> k
[15:08:13] <chachan> guys, I want to apply fadeIn to <p class="hide">, the "hide" class is part of bootstrap, they make display:none!important. The fadeIn is not working, any reason?
[15:09:24] <clov3r> chachan: yep, the !important overrides jquery's inline style
[15:09:32] <clov3r> so you either have to edit bootstrap's css
[15:09:41] <clov3r> or remove the hide class when you want to show
[15:10:01] <chachan> removing won't show up the element without the effect?
[15:10:13] <chachan> removing the class I meant
[15:15:54] <jphase> chachan: you can just add another class that has display: none; on it (without the immportant) and use that class instead, which won't break .fadeIn()
[15:21:35] <chachan> jphase, yeap, that's an option. Thanks!
[15:22:02] <jphase> np
[15:41:08] <royalty> hello
[15:41:49] <royalty> I have a feeling this selector is not grabbing inputs on IE8 and IE9 jQuery('input[type=text], input[type=email]'), does this sound plausible?
[15:42:40] <Zzaichik> ('input[type="text"], input(type="email"]')
[15:42:51] <royalty> yeah
[15:42:57] <royalty> oh
[15:42:57] <royalty> lol
[15:43:00] <Zzaichik> ;p
[15:43:04] <royalty> =)
[15:43:06] <royalty> lovely
[15:47:28] <royalty> hmmm another part of this script might be malfunctioning
[16:16:20] <royalty> Zzaichik, I just tested it, it turns out it was selecting correctly even without the quotes, interesting
[16:16:46] <royalty> the problem I am having is something else dealing with pure JS I'll look more into it
[16:25:16] <Taggnostr> hello
[16:38:09] <ashnur> hi
[16:39:15] <ashnur> can someone explain me dafuq this line does? https://github.com/FrDH/jQuery.dotdotdot/blob/master/jquery.dotdotdot.js#L84 how will the value of $inr before this line differ from the value after this line?
[16:44:05] <ashnur> helo?
[16:44:21] <ashnur> amirite that line does nothing?
[16:48:06] <zakj> ashnur: looks to me like it's wrapping the children elements of $dot in div.dotdotdot, then selecting those children and assigning the selection to $inr
[16:49:03] <ashnur> zakj: thanks, it took me some time to realize what exactly wrapInner does.
[17:03:20] <Taggnostr> I'm using $(window).scroll() to control the position of an element in the page, but users reported that it's slow on opera with an old pc.  Are there any trick to optimize .scroll()?
[17:06:22] <duch_kazatel> Taggnostr .scroll() isn't slow, but things that happen as a result of scrolling can be.
[17:06:34] <duch_kazatel> are you doing a bunch of calculations or something?
[17:07:15] <Taggnostr> duch_kazatel, see the sidebar at http://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
[17:07:46] <Taggnostr> the code is http://docs.python.org/3/_static/sidebar.js near the bottom
[17:08:29] <Taggnostr> I'm doing some calculations and repositioning via css, but it doesn't seem too heavy to me
[17:13:47] <zakj> Taggnostr: The scroll event fires very frequently while scrolling, and setting .css('top') (in the "else" branch of scroll_sidebar) causes a browser repaint/reflow
[17:14:34] <zakj> Taggnostr: First thing to consider would be using fixed positioning for the sidebar; if you can't get away with that, consider throttling your scroll_sidebar calls
[17:15:05] <Taggnostr> zakj, you mean return immediately if the function has just been called?
[17:15:41] <Taggnostr> so that it doesn't update continuously?
[17:16:08] <zakj> right; take a look at underscore's implementation of throttle/debounce: http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-66
[17:16:45] <Taggnostr> thanks
[17:17:50] <zakj> np!

[17:19:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> can any one give me the relevent snippets to do that
[17:19:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> webdesignerdepots css is a mess
[17:20:56] <LessSeen> webgl maybe? ps its borkd on windows
[17:21:19] <Taggnostr> Rohan_Bhangui, I've seen that elsewhere, including some tutorial that explains how to do it
[17:21:19] <LessSeen> or 3d transform
[17:21:32] <Taggnostr> I think it was from the reveal.js guy
[17:21:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Taggnostr: any links you know where they teach this
[17:21:42] <LessSeen> sweet reveal is awesome

[17:22:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> k thx
[17:22:38] <Taggnostr> LessSeen, do you use reveal.js?
[17:23:15] <LessSeen> sure whenever i get a chance, its got some sweet built in transitions
[17:23:53] <Taggnostr> LessSeen, do you know rst (restructured text)?
[17:24:31] <Taggnostr> I made a script to make reveal presentations in rst
[17:25:45] <pamere> Hi whats wrong with the following, $(document).on("change", '.countryadd [data-randomdata='+randomno+']', function () { });
[17:25:47] <pamere> ?
[17:26:20] <Taggnostr> pamere, the space after .countryadd?
[17:27:43] <pamere> darn
[17:27:44] <pamere> yes
[17:27:48] <pamere> thank you so muchhh
[17:27:49] <pamere>  :)
[17:29:40] <Taggnostr> zakj, what do you think about https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/jquery-patterns/window-scroll-event.html ?
[17:33:24] <zakj> I would avoid the "preferred" section, since it's going to run script every 250ms whether there was a scroll or not; v2 looks good, except that it may not update frequently enough... as long as scroll events keep happening in <250ms, scrollHandler is never called.
[17:34:46] <Taggnostr> indeed
[17:36:59] <zakj> Taggnostr: (not to harp on it, but I would really just snag throttle from underscore; I know the implementation is a bit opaque, but it's battle tested and nicely generic. linking the docs rather than the source this time: http://underscorejs.org/#throttle)
[17:38:45] <Taggnostr> zakj, I was evening thinking to have a global var with the time in milliseconds, and at the top of my function do if (now() - globaltime < 250) return; else globaltime = now()
[17:38:54] <Taggnostr> or something similar
[17:39:33] <Taggnostr> it would still call the function several times, but assuming that's not too expensive it should avoid executing all the content every time
[17:43:02] <zakj> that's similar to throttle's implementation, except since throttle uses a closure it gets to avoid the global var ;)
[17:43:54] <Taggnostr> zakj, except that the throttle implementation is more code than the scrolling function :)
[17:44:37] <zakj> touche!
[18:03:17] <jimmt> can I get the return value of an asynchronous $.ajax
[18:03:22] <jimmt> the page's response i mean
[18:03:34] <jimmt> without a callback function, just getting the response synchronously
[18:06:14] <zakj> jimmt: not with an asynchronous $.ajax call, but $.ajax does have an "async" setting... though it's now deprecated, so you're almost certainly better off using a callback
[18:06:38] <jimmt> I meant synchronous
[18:06:46] <jimmt> is that really deprecated?
[18:06:56] <jimmt> synchronous requests are necessary sometimes not to have ridiculous code
[18:07:10] <zakj> jimmt: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:07:37] <jimmt> I'm just using an xmlhttprequest now anyway
[18:07:48] <zakj> I find making non-anonymous callback functions helps to reduce the ridiculousness; saves you a bunch of nesting, at least
[18:09:04] <LoneSoldier728> hey what is a good framework
[18:09:16] <LoneSoldier728> I learned backbone but heard that is only useful for an SPA
[18:12:31] <ericelliott> Backbone is useful for all kinds of apps. Its primary use case is separating concerns on the client... in other words, keeping things like data manipulation and business logic separate from things like UI updates.
[18:12:46] <Ansikt> Backbone is like
[18:12:51] <ericelliott> Backbone.Router is primarily useful for single page apps.
[18:13:13] <ericelliott> LoneSoldier728: If I was starting a new app right now, though.. I'd use polymer.
[18:13:24] <Ansikt> You know how javascript is a really powerful language that people write really badly, but java is a really plain language which people do amazing things in?
[18:13:24] <ericelliott> Web Components are the future. =)
[18:13:44] <Velveeta> +1 for web components
[18:13:50] <Ansikt> Backbone gives you the kind of structure in Javascript that Java has by default.  Kinda.  Sorta.
[18:14:20] <ericelliott> Ansikt: http://vimeo.com/69255635
[18:14:35] <Velveeta> i like to describe backbone as a really powerful minimalist framework… it allows you to do great code organization without being overly opinionated on how it should be implemented
[18:14:39] <ericelliott> Ansikt: Go watch that. Then come tell me how cool Java is again.
[18:16:24] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[18:17:11] <Ansikt> ericelliott: I totally agree.  I maybe wasn't very clear - JavaScript is a REALLY awesome language.  Of the non-obscure languages, it's one of my favorites.  But it gives you more than enough rope to hang yourself with.  Open any random page on the internet, and 9/10 you'll see piles and piles of global variables, inline javascript, scripts being included multiple times, etc.
[18:17:28] <Velveeta> ericelliott: thanks for the link, one more for my and my coworkers library :D
[18:18:24] <Velveeta> ansikt: and sometimes you find those rare gems using eval just to reference object properties in dot notation that they could just as easily do with bracket notation :)
[18:18:36] <LoneSoldier728> right but backbone is hard to use
[18:18:40] <LoneSoldier728> if it is not an spa
[18:19:04] <LoneSoldier728> because everything initiated from the router
[18:19:23] <Velveeta> that's *if* you use a backbone router, it's certainly not required
[18:19:45] <Velveeta> but if you're using a backbone router, you should be using it for SPA purposes
[18:20:14] <Velveeta> at least, *i* personally wouldn't be using a mix of multipage navigation along with single-page app behavior from page load to page load
[18:20:16] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947280/how-do-i-use-backbone-on-multiple-pages
[18:21:07] <LoneSoldier728> you see that question
[18:21:11] <Velveeta> i don't know that i would agree that it was designed for single page apps, but i also don't know the mindset of the initial developers… i do know that it lends itself well to single page apps, but it's designed around the amd paradigm in general
[18:21:43] <LoneSoldier728> well I am assuming I would just make multiple mainU.js files but different
[18:21:45] <Velveeta> and amd can easily be used in multi-page applications just as in single page… the advantage of single-page apps though, is prebundling all of your dependencies for deployment
[18:21:50] <LoneSoldier728> ones for each page
[18:22:23] <Velveeta> and you can still do something like that with a multipage app, and take advantage of browser caching, if you cache your base dependencies separately from the page level js that might differ from page to page
[18:22:48] <Velveeta> e.g. make one prebuilt bundle that includes items like jquery, underscore, handlebars, whatever, and then have your page-level js modules in a separate prebuilt bundle
[18:23:06] <LoneSoldier728> right
[18:23:08] <Velveeta> but that's more deployment strategy than architecture in general
[18:23:19] <LoneSoldier728> but back to my question then, is there a better alternative to learn
[18:23:20] <Velveeta> i would say backbone is equally useful in either single or multi-page apps
[18:23:23] <LoneSoldier728> like angular.js
[18:23:25] <LoneSoldier728> or something
[18:23:31] <LoneSoldier728> that has a better framework style
[18:23:54] <Velveeta> well, people like to throw around terms like "better" and "best", but the reason all of these various frameworks exist is that each one fills a need that people didn't think was covered already by some other framework
[18:24:09] <Velveeta> so better and best framework is really dependent on your needs for an application
[18:24:34] <Velveeta> people love to ask blanket questions like "what's the best framework out there?" …well, it depends, for what purpose?
[18:25:48] <LoneSoldier728> right so if I am trying to make a multi page app, isnt that enough of a purpose?
[18:26:24] <Velveeta> ok, so then you can pick from ember, knockout, angular, polymer, backbone, dot dot dot...
[18:26:46] <Velveeta> do you need to have 2-way data binding? easily-reusable web components? what kinds of browser support? etc
[18:26:55] <Velveeta> those are the kinds of needs i'm talking about
[18:27:43] <Velveeta> do you want a framework that's heavily opinionated and requires you to buy into its methodology wholesale, or one that helps with organization and gets out of the way besides that? is ongoing maintenance of the project itself important to you? some are maintained better than other
[18:51:13] <LoneSoldier728> yeah sorry I keep missing the convo here
[18:51:25] <LoneSoldier728> but yeah, I rather do most of the work myself just use it for organization
[18:51:43] <LoneSoldier728> but would not mind look into something, might look into angular
[18:57:44] <Velveeta> so angular is one of those things that wants to run the show… it's great for scope isolation and reusable components in the form of directives, but its digest cycle expects to be the one making any changes to the document
[18:57:59] <Velveeta> so it's definitely not a minimalist kind of framework, but it is definitely a powerful one
[19:03:17] <LoneSoldier728> but it works well in organization
[19:03:25] <LoneSoldier728> for multiple pages, or does it run from one js file too?
[19:03:41] <Velveeta> angular works fine for multiple pages
[19:04:50] <LoneSoldier728> thanks
[19:04:54] <LoneSoldier728> for all ur help and advice btw
[19:04:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you have any tips for how to save space in a mobile website
[19:04:59] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:05:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is just 1 page no scrolling allowed
[19:05:22] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui - font-size: 1px;
[19:05:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:05:48] <Velveeta> i don't know, what kind of space are you trying to save? do you mean shaving padding/margin, or figuring out what elements to get rid of altogether?
[19:06:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> not get rid of elements but move them aorund
[19:06:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> like a great space saver is like
[19:06:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> hidden sidebars
[19:06:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> that float in
[19:06:42] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[19:07:32] <Velveeta> i don't really have any pointers in that area, i'm only just now starting to get into mobile web development myself, because some of our product teams are wanting it
[19:08:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i just got thrown into a sea of mobile dev today with no life vest
[19:08:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> and trust the water is cold
[19:09:34] <Velveeta> yeah, it's definitely taking me back to the days when i had to worry about IE being the one to hose the game… now IE itself is getting fairly decent as far as web standards are concerned, but having to support mobile browser limitations is the black sheep of the web dev family now
[19:09:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> itll progrss
[19:10:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> one thing for sure is needed is the ability to turn full screen on on all devices
[19:10:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> to give a more native app feel
[19:11:24] <Velveeta> so i'm in charge of our internal widget library, and my plans for them are to make them aware of the environment they have to work in, and use one of multiple templates to render their content based on their container size… sort of a combination of element queries and javascript templates
[19:12:13] <Velveeta> i think traditionally, responsive web development has included pushing all the content out to the client and then manipulating its display based on how much real estate they have to work with… the problem with that though, is that if you hide 90% of your stuff in a smartphone environment, you still have 90% hidden dom bloat eating up resources
[19:13:00] <Velveeta> so i want to provide my users the ability to specify their breakpoints with templates, because if they're rendering a data grid that has 20 columns, on a desktop, that's fine, on a tablet, you may want to ditch half those fields and focus on the more important ones
[19:13:07] <mdev> velvetta is about css media
[19:13:15] <mdev> it uses css file/settings based off screen
[19:13:26] <mdev> I doubt it uses both, but idk
[19:13:28] <Velveeta> and on a smartphone, you may want to tile things vertically as well as combining into a single cell and rearranging the layout of those items to focus on the most important
[19:14:18] <Velveeta> the idea being that on different sized interfaces, different content becomes more important as a focal point, and even the layout of those items may be completely different, and there's no reason to include all that extra dom bloat
[19:15:36] <Velveeta> mdev: if you're talking about media queries, that's what this method is simulating, but without the extra markup just being hidden or transformed
[19:16:00] <Velveeta> it would actually remove that bloat by using a different template altogether for rendering purposes
[19:16:38] <Velveeta> it would behave the same way as a media query, but actually tailor the markup to the real estate
[19:17:09] <Velveeta> and really it would more closely resemble element queries vs media queries, as it might use a smaller rendering template even in a desktop environment, if its container width is restricted
[19:17:58] <Velveeta> so they may have an 800px container floated next to a 200px container, both with data grids, but the 800px container would display the full sized template, and the 200px container would display a smartphone-sized version of the template, because they're checking their available container space vs the window space in general
[19:18:28] <Velveeta> but i probably won't realistically get to that sort of work until early next year :)
[20:31:26] <sayd> anyone loading angular via getScript? I am having trouble bootstrapping which I want to do because only a part of the site (based on user opening lightbox) should load angular for now. $.when( $.getScript( 'js/angular.js' ), $.getScript( 'js/angular-share.js' ).then(function() { /* never runs */ })
[20:38:58] <martisj> morning
[20:44:55] <LoneSoldier728> I am having a hardtime understanding how splice works exactly
[20:45:13] <LoneSoldier728> if I call .splice(0, 25) I know u can return the removed items
[20:45:17] <LoneSoldier728> how do I do that exactly
[20:45:22] <LoneSoldier728> is it just return newArray
[20:45:33] <LoneSoldier728> right after the splice and it will show the new items?
[20:57:35] <martisj> how do you get your team to start writing sensible markup
[20:57:36] <martisj> ?
[20:57:50] <LoneSoldier728> knock them on the side of their heads?
[20:58:03] <martisj> LoneSoldier728: hahaha
[20:58:06] <martisj> sounds like a plan
[20:58:14] <LoneSoldier728> why what are they writting currently
[20:58:16] <LoneSoldier728> writing*
[20:59:04] <LoneSoldier728> example wise
[21:00:13] <LoneSoldier728> anyone understand the splice command
[21:00:29] <LoneSoldier728> trying to make sense of how to return the items u spliced into a new array
[21:01:08] <LoneSoldier728> according to the docs you can return it, but I do not see it implemented, I see items in the parameters but from what I understand that pushes the items into the array
[21:03:17] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/d7HJE/
[21:03:39] <jtreminio> Hi all! What's the reverse of parseHTML()? I want to edit a string html value then reinsert it
[21:03:56] <LoneSoldier728> )(LMTHesrap
[21:04:07] <martisj> LoneSoldier728: they put <link href … in the middle of the body,
[21:04:35] <LoneSoldier728> what do u mean
[21:04:49] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok
[21:04:58] <LoneSoldier728> lol i thought u were answering me for the jsfiddle
[21:06:39] <martisj> what is it you don't understand?
[21:06:46] <LoneSoldier728> got it
[21:06:54] <LoneSoldier728> nvm i understand it now
[21:07:06] <martisj> LoneSoldier728: goody
[21:07:09] <jtreminio> I have an object value of http://pastebin.com/jV3CT7ST
[21:07:34] <jtreminio> Using parseHTML() I can get to the base64 src I want to change, but how do I join it back into a string like that?
[21:08:52] <Velveeta> martisj: we take care of that kind of problem via peer reviews of our checkins ;)
[21:09:07] <martisj> Velveeta: none existent at our company
[21:09:15] <martisj> anybody heard of dawn of midi
[21:09:19] <martisj> dawnofmidi.com
[21:09:28] <Velveeta> pioneer it, looks good on a performance review ;)
[21:24:05] <martisj> Velveeta: hahaha; i should mention that i am the only working on the code at the moment, we're waiting for a new dev.
[21:24:07] <martisj> hahaha
[21:24:16] <martisj> and the other one has been contracted out.
[21:26:04] <martisj> anybody know what   if(response.multiple)  from an ajax success response means?
[21:31:56] <Velveeta> martisj: but you asked how to get developers to stop writing crappy markup…. if you're the only one working on the code, are you the one writing that crappy markup? …..is this a cry for help? :D
[21:32:45] <Velveeta> martisj: as far as response.multiple, that's coming from your server, so it depends on what the meaning of your response data is..
[21:36:52] <martisj> Velveeta: I probably write crappy markup as well, but not as crappy as some of the shit i find lying around in our codebase.
[21:37:10] <martisj> Velveeta: I saw that the multiple was coming from the server now .
[21:44:15] <jop008> I have availability per month (12 items) every month has a status red green or orange how to display this compact (mobile)?
[21:45:21] <jop008> I will make a table for it 2 rows and a bgcolor per cell other ways?
[21:48:53] <martisj> hahhahahaha :)
[21:49:03] <martisj> jop008: is that a questioN/
[21:52:55] <sammych> wanna confirm this. if you had a simple mapping of <if this string, then set this string to that>. We previously had if (string = thatString) anotherString = 'aString'). So I mapped it to anotherString = mapping[string] (with mapping{} defined already).
[21:53:31] <sammych> using the object mapping is faster than the stack of ifs, isn't it?
[21:54:08] * sammych hopes it makes sense
[21:54:34] <martisj> is it possible to add a .one() like action to a save button inside a jquery ui modal dialog?
[22:01:03] <LoneSoldier728> what is the best way to make "pages"
[22:01:24] <CorySimmons> martisj: What? a .one() like action?
[22:01:31] <CorySimmons> LoneSoldier728: More specific plz
[22:01:32] <LoneSoldier728> I currently have an array with arrays in them to be used to make a page
[22:01:51] <martisj> CorySimmons: where the button can only be pushed ONCE
[22:02:17] <LoneSoldier728> Ok so I have [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]] and basically I want to keep the user on the page and say if they are on page 1 then show [1,2]
[22:02:32] <LoneSoldier728> and have a next and previous page (obviously disabled if there is nothing previous or nothing next)
[22:02:41] <LoneSoldier728> I will get a jsfiddle with my attempt
[22:03:17] <jop008> a bit of a question how to display a status per month on a compact way
[22:07:50] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/g2ZXh/
[22:07:55] <LoneSoldier728> that is my attempt
[22:08:34] <LoneSoldier728> but the problem I am having - is that it keeps looping through until i < pages showing next and prev a couple of times
[22:11:17] <LoneSoldier728> does it make sense lol
[22:14:03] <CorySimmons> martisj: Why can't you just use .one() ?
[22:14:39] <martisj> CorySimmons: when you're adding a dialog box you add buttons dynamically with the buttons: option
[22:14:48] <martisj> so you're not really listening to an event.
[22:15:20] <CorySimmons> Like $('.save').one('click', function() { $.ajax({ … }) }); ?
[22:15:54] <CorySimmons> Oh, I dunno, maybe you can bind them with something fancy
[22:16:07] <CorySimmons> All that event binding crap confuses me but sounds like what you need
[22:17:38] <LoneSoldier728> tell me about it cory
[22:18:19] <martisj> CorySimmons: thanks :)
[22:18:25] <martisj> hey ho must go
[22:20:48] <CorySimmons> Ok, sorry Lone, busy with stuff, what's your deal? You need pages?
[22:22:54] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[22:23:12] <LoneSoldier728> basically trying to make pages and then have to load the apropriate content
[22:23:13] <LoneSoldier728> per page
[22:24:46] <CorySimmons> Are you making table based layouts/pages with JavaScript?
[22:24:56] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[22:25:10] <LoneSoldier728> I am up for suggestions tho honestly
[22:25:24] <LoneSoldier728> I was looking to avoid tables at first but not sure if it makes sense
[22:25:44] <LoneSoldier728> to use table since my data is basically (title, artist, date, number, extra)
[22:26:10] <CorySimmons> Are you trying to make separate pages? Use .html ?
[22:26:18] <CorySimmons> Or .php ?
[22:26:25] <CorySimmons> Why are you using JS to make "pages" ?
[22:26:56] <LoneSoldier728> i am using jade
[22:26:59] <LoneSoldier728> template engine
[22:27:04] <CorySimmons> Ok why?
[22:27:10] <CorySimmons> I mean, what is your full stack?
[22:27:25] <LoneSoldier728> node.js, jade, css, js file
[22:27:28] <LoneSoldier728> files
[22:27:40] <LoneSoldier728> basically I render the page server side
[22:28:08] <CorySimmons> How are you rendering server side?
[22:28:22] <LoneSoldier728> from node I render the jade view
[22:28:30] <CorySimmons> Jade holds multiple views?
[22:28:34] <LoneSoldier728> based on a POST
[22:28:36] <CorySimmons> Or just layout + partials
[22:28:41] <CorySimmons> What POST?
[22:28:51] <LoneSoldier728> jade is basically a bunch of views
[22:29:00] <LoneSoldier728> separate for each page like /about
[22:29:10] <LoneSoldier728> or /contact
[22:29:14] <LoneSoldier728> they are separate views
[22:29:26] <LoneSoldier728> but jade lets you use an easy less style writing
[22:29:42] <LoneSoldier728> and include js and html right on the file
[22:29:50] <LoneSoldier728> and the way it is flowing for the page is
[22:30:09] <LoneSoldier728> I have a form POST that hits the server when the search button is clicked
[22:30:15] <CorySimmons> Ok hang on, lemme make a Jade site
[22:30:16] <CorySimmons> brb
[22:30:21] <LoneSoldier728> and then from there I render
[22:30:28] <LoneSoldier728> the jade view with the results
[22:30:28] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[22:36:08] <CorySimmons> Oh ok I think I see what you're doing
[22:36:15] <CorySimmons> Not server-side at all though ;)
[22:36:28] <CorySimmons> You're just using Node to use Jade and Jade is all client-side
[22:37:12] <CorySimmons> So what you're trying to do is have an array of objects
[22:37:35] <CorySimmons> Actually, maybe you need an object of objects
[22:37:45] <CorySimmons> What are your pages?
[22:38:14] <Velveeta> jade is a server-side templating system
[22:38:37] <Velveeta> think of like smarty templates under php or something, but his is running under node
[22:39:29] <CorySimmons> hehe, I know what it is ;)
[22:40:04] <Velveeta> ok, i wasn't sure since you said "and jade is all client-side"
[22:41:36] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok
[22:41:55] <LoneSoldier728> so basically
[22:42:06] <LoneSoldier728> now I have this being passed back an array of arrays
[22:42:16] <LoneSoldier728> so I can do array.length to get the number of pages
[22:42:34] <LoneSoldier728> and for each index[0] is an array and i can loop within that array
[22:42:41] <LoneSoldier728> and print a td
[22:42:48] <LoneSoldier728> with the values inside the array
[22:43:22] <LoneSoldier728> but everything is screwed up since I basically have to create pages, and state what shows up on what page
[22:43:39] <LoneSoldier728> and I am not sure how to go about that as you saw my attempt
[22:44:05] <LoneSoldier728> velveeta
[22:44:12] <LoneSoldier728> if u can take a stab at it too
[22:44:16] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/g2ZXh/
[22:44:27] <LoneSoldier728> that is a basic thing of what I am trying to do
[22:44:31] <LoneSoldier728> to create the pages
[22:46:47] <CorySimmons> Yeah working on it locally
[22:46:52] <CorySimmons> Needed to learn jade anyway
[22:47:10] <CorySimmons> You really shouldn't be using tables for layouts of almost any kind unless you're simply trying to display data or do a calendar
[22:47:37] <LoneSoldier728> well this is the data I want to
[22:47:39] <LoneSoldier728> display
[22:47:45] <LoneSoldier728> http://www.dogstarradio.com/search_playlist.php?artist=&title=&channel=52&month=&date=&shour=&sampm=&stz=&ehour=&eampm=&resultcount=342&page=0
[22:47:47] <LoneSoldier728> i.e.
[22:47:50] <LoneSoldier728> see that list
[22:47:56] <LoneSoldier728> I am making something similar
[22:49:40] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: so if you're receiving this data, and your loop seems to show that you know how you want to render it in the page, what's your question again?
[22:50:47] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/u92eC4i0
[22:50:55] <LoneSoldier728> that is my jade attempt
[22:50:59] <LoneSoldier728> basically
[22:51:14] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to create next, current, previous pages
[22:51:26] <LoneSoldier728> with the data showing only for what the current page is
[22:51:33] <LoneSoldier728> while making next and previous working
[22:52:45] <LoneSoldier728> the problem with how I have it written is that it shows
[22:52:52] <LoneSoldier728> all the next and current pages
[22:52:55] <LoneSoldier728> on the one page
[22:53:00] <LoneSoldier728> and also, the data is not showing up
[22:55:22] <Velveeta> well one problem i see in the template is that you're using i as a numeric incrementor on your page-level for loop, and then down below, you're saying for x in i
[22:55:49] <Velveeta> at that point, isn't i gonna be equal to pages?
[22:55:56] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/AexvcJp7
[22:55:57] <LoneSoldier728> sorry
[22:56:00] <LoneSoldier728> i updated it
[22:56:05] <LoneSoldier728> had some things i left in
[22:56:38] <LoneSoldier728> ah yes i meant result[i] kk
[22:56:47] <Velveeta> same problem, you're still saying for x in i (a number)
[22:56:58] <Velveeta> that should probably be results[i]
[22:58:09] <LoneSoldier728> result is the list not results heh
[23:00:12] <LoneSoldier728> ok got results showing but the pages ya
[23:00:27] <LoneSoldier728> not sure how to make those work without leaving the page
[23:11:39] <CorySimmons> LoneSoldier728: hah, I suck at JS
[23:12:02] <LoneSoldier728> ha u cant figure it out
[23:12:13] <LoneSoldier728> right now what i see on my page is basically
[23:12:26] <LoneSoldier728> the last array out of the 5 I have setup
[23:12:37] <LoneSoldier728> and all the next and previous show on top
[23:16:27] <CorySimmons> I have a question, why is this not console logging? http://pastie.org/8403102
[23:17:31] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[23:17:45] <LoneSoldier728> nothing shows up
[23:17:47] <LoneSoldier728> in ur console
[23:18:23] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/AsyPg/
[23:18:34] <LoneSoldier728> not sure if it actually is working for me there tho because it is json
[23:19:32] <LoneSoldier728> ya not sure what shows up on the console
[23:27:17] <Betal> wait
[23:27:30] <Betal> erm, wrong channel hehe
[23:27:37] <LoneSoldier728> what
[23:28:21] <Betal> LoneSoldier728: I have sent the message to the wrong channel
[23:28:39] <LoneSoldier728> is this the right channel, cuz i didnt see a msg from u
[23:31:15] <CorySimmons> LoneSoldier728: Sorry i suck good luck
[23:31:24] <LoneSoldier728> haha thanks
[23:31:30] <LoneSoldier728> im bothering the nodejs folks
[23:31:35] <LoneSoldier728> hopefully they can work it out
[23:55:22] <lite_> pardon my ignorance, what is being selected here : a[class!="overlay"] ?
[23:55:50] <lite_> the first anchor that isnt of class overlay ?
[23:55:51] <Cork> lite_: $('a').not('.overlay')
[23:56:09] <Cork> but in a really inefficient way
[23:56:55] <Cork> and actually it won't match ex. class="overlay dialog"
[23:57:00] <lite_> basically ive got a ticket "whats wrong here?" and $('a[class!="overlay"]').live('click', function(e) throws Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'live'
[23:57:18] <Cork> live is removed in 1.9+
[23:57:33] <Cork> but ya, there is A LOT wrong there
[23:57:42] <lite_> mind walking me through it?
[23:58:01] <lite_> if i reload the page the error doesnt occur
[23:58:01] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a:not(.overlay', function() {})
[23:58:08] <Cork> opps
[23:58:13] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a:not(.overlay)', function() {})
[23:59:05] <lite_> whats better about that approach? id like to know _why_ this is the way to go and what is wrong with the old way? Mind you i didnt write any of this
[23:59:26] <Cork> $().live first searches through the dom for all elements matching the selector
[23:59:39] <Cork> then throws away the array of matched elements
