[03:27:08] <hellyeah> hey

[05:11:18] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[05:11:31] <BarnaSzalai> how to set $(this) to an element in developer toolbar?
[05:16:10] <xec> (function($){ /* in here, $(this) will return "an element" */ })((function(x){ return x}).bind("an element"));
[05:16:25] <xec> BarnaSzalai: but I expect that's not really what you wanted
[05:17:43] <xec> i messed up the parens there, but i meant it as a joke anyway :P
[05:21:21] <rogger_h> Hello all, how do i get a global scope varible inside a module to pass to a sub function module { var connection = 1; var user = { create : function() { when im using this.connection its not working } }}
[05:21:22] <rogger_h> ideas
[05:27:12] <Xatenev> rogger_h: didnt i tell you that in #javascript minutes ago?
[05:27:20] <Xatenev> rogger_h: console.log(connection); ...
[05:27:24] <Xatenev> no this

[06:30:53] <workcat> Hello
[06:31:15] <workcat> can I use .add() to add to a selection?
[06:31:42] <workcat> for example if I have A and B
[06:32:03] <workcat> and I want to show both A and B
[06:32:18] <workcat> can I do A.add(B) ?
[06:44:33] <hellyeah> hey
[06:44:36] <hellyeah> if you drop button onto another button you will see them in a div that s okey. But i need something like that <ul><li><button></button></li><li><button></li></ul> but what i have is <ul><li><button><button></li></ul> how can i fix that http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/39/
[06:44:40] <Duvdevan> jQuery is the best!
[06:44:46] <hellyeah> why?
[07:18:38] <sigdk> Hello. How can I call the corresponding function whenever a tab is clicked here: http://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/2/ ?  Shall I use an if-else block to figure out the ui (I guess this refers to each tab) that has been clicked or is there a nicer way ?
[07:19:06] <petisnnake> Hello, I have a jquery element that has some events (click, mouseover etc) attached to it. If I wrap the element in a div using wrap(), the events stay attached in Chrome, but not in IE. Is this correct or am i missing something?
[07:19:33] <Cork> sigdk: use an array for the functions instead of separate names
[07:20:50] <Cork> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/3/
[07:21:14] <Cork> petisnnake: no the events should stay in all browsers
[07:24:42] <sigdk> Cork, that looks very nice... do I put f[ui.newTab.index()](); inside my activate: function(event, ui) { } block ? Currently it doesn't work
[07:25:08] <Cork> sigdk: currently you have the functions defined in different scopes
[07:25:19] <Cork> so the array isn't accessable
[07:33:10] <nru> for windows users, which IDE do you use for programming ?
[07:33:42] <Cork> for any os sublime text is one of the best
[07:33:47] <Cork> atom is getting there
[07:33:51] <Cork> vim is nice too
[07:34:01] <Cork> they aren't really ide though
[07:34:12] <nru> i use Atom :)
[07:34:29] <nru> but everytime it gets updated the Shortcut gets broke :(
[07:34:53] <nru> thanks
[07:47:26] <cyberbrai> hello everyone :)
[07:48:04] <cyberbrai> How to prevent a user from having multiple instances of the Same Web application
[07:48:09] <cyberbrai> anyone
[08:07:12] <cyberbrai> no one in chanel
[08:15:15] <petisnnake> Does .mouseover() work completely differently in IE than Chrome?
[08:15:41] <petisnnake> on chrome it only triggers once, when I enter the element, on IE it seems to trigger on every single movemement over the element
[08:15:43] <petisnnake> is this correct?
[08:18:41] <Cork> petisnnake: are you talking about older ie?
[08:19:16] <petisnnake> Cork: edge. must be something with my jquery, an older version perhaps. it works fine if i jsfiddle it
[08:19:35] <Cork> petisnnake: then most likely not
[08:19:40] <cyberbrai> How to prevent a user from having multiple instances of the Same Web application
[08:19:46] <Cork> it would have to be quite a severe bug in edge if it did that
[08:19:57] <Cork> cyberbrai: you can't, really
[08:20:08] <cyberbrai> Cork : why
[08:20:29] <Cork> you can have them login in, and from there only allow the login once, but if they copy the sessionid you would be none the wiser
[08:20:48] <Cork> cyberbrai: cause you don't have that level of control over the browser
[08:20:59] <cyberbrai> i forgot but i see in some web app
[08:21:25] <cyberbrai> you cannot open the same web app in two tabs
[08:21:37] <Cork> never seen that
[08:22:02] <Cork> and there isn't really a way to do it
[08:22:14] <Cork> the only solution i can think of is through a websocket connection
[08:22:26] <Cork> and refusing the second connection if there is already one
[08:22:33] <cyberbrai> navigator.window somthing like that
[08:22:41] <Cork> no
[08:22:53] <Cork> that is only possible if you do a popup for the page
[08:23:02] <Cork> if the user loads the url directly you can't do that
[08:23:23] <cyberbrai> ok Cork thanks for help
[08:23:31] <cyberbrai> let me try on my end
[08:24:07] <Cork> cyberbrai: and most of the time you should ask your self why you feel you need to limit it like that
[08:24:41] <Cork> cause the better option is normally to just write the app so it works with it (it doesn't really require much extra work)
[08:25:01] <cyberbrai> Cork extremely sorrry for that
[08:25:09] <hellyeah> hey
[08:25:24] <hellyeah> pls answer me this is different subject
[08:25:28] <cyberbrai> one more thing how can i convert the date into timestampz
[08:26:09] <hellyeah> you can add element with add button when i add new element i want to disable pervious add button. Is there any tipes you can give me about this  https://jsfiddle.net/6pr74p5q/14/
[08:28:13] <petisnnake> Cork: I may have found my issue with mouseover() in IE. If I wrap() my element on mouseover(), in IE it seems to trigger the event once again, wrapping the current element over and over again. In Chrome mouseover() isnt triggered again after the wrap(). Is this a known issue?
[08:28:38] <Cork> petisnnake: ah, ya some events refire when you restructure the dom
[08:28:59] <Cork> you might want to avoid modifying the dom for styling
[08:29:26] <Cork> add the needed dom elements when the code loads, and then just change the classes on them
[08:32:42] <petisnnake> Cork, any ideas how i can get around this? here is a jsfiddle illustrating the problem. a dot appears whenever the event fires. on Chrome its normal, on IE its crazy http://jsfiddle.net/r4pu56xf/3/
[08:33:10] <Cork> petisnnake: why do you feel you need to wrap the element?
[08:33:43] <petisnnake> Cork, cause I need to put a tooltip in the top left corner of a hovered element
[08:33:56] <Cork> ok?
[08:33:58] <petisnnake> so im wrapping the element, appending a div with position absolute
[08:34:08] <Cork> and :before isn't good enough for that?
[08:34:59] <petisnnake> well no
[08:35:15] <petisnnake> cause then the tooltip will be relative to the parent container
[08:35:30] <Cork> uh
[08:35:32] <petisnnake> and i need it to look like the tooltip is on the top left of the hovered element
[08:35:42] <petisnnake> it works perfectly in chrome
[08:35:51] <petisnnake> im having issues with ie though
[08:38:42] <Cork> petisnnake: https://jsfiddle.net/r4pu56xf/4/
[08:39:32] <Cork> and if the tooltip text doesn't have to be dynamic you won't even need js for this
[08:40:49] <Cork> petisnnake: https://jsfiddle.net/r4pu56xf/5/
[08:41:36] <petisnnake> Cork, thats a great idea, didnt even think of doing it html side. I can just wrap every hoverable element with a container beforehand
[08:41:44] <petisnnake> thanks so much for the great solution
[08:42:21] <Cork> np :)
[08:42:34] <Cork> i love proving that js isn't needed by far as often as ppl think :)
[08:43:58] <petisnnake> ehe
[08:44:00] <petisnnake> hehe*
[08:55:37] <ace_me> I need some help for avoiding resubmission of same form multiple times ... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/44625c5600952f3e1ed8
[08:56:21] <Cork> ace_me: set prop('disabled', true) on the forms submit button
[08:56:41] <ace_me> I've tried that too Cork let me paste it
[08:57:53] <ace_me> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6759adb8b4f823c77c0a Cork
[08:58:22] <Cork> ace_me: uh, that code is sync
[08:58:35] <Cork> the button won't even have time to be rendered disabled
[08:58:45] <ace_me> :)
[08:58:47] <Cork> also don't do it on click
[08:59:34] <ace_me> Cork normally I have it on         $("#submit-campaign").submit(function(e) {
[08:59:43] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function() {  $(this).find(':submit').prop('disabled'. true); });
[08:59:46] <ace_me> but I di tried already for a hour or so
[08:59:59] <ace_me> let me try
[08:59:59] <Cork> submit-campaign is the button right?
[09:00:03] <ace_me> yes
[09:00:14] <Cork> the submit event is for the form
[09:00:16] <Cork> not the button
[09:00:46] <ace_me> uhhh
[09:00:55] <ace_me> let me fix the mistake ;) thx
[09:04:46] <FinalAngel> hey guys, we're on hackernews https://news.ycombinator.com/newest as "Django CMS 3.2 released" please help promoting this awesome release :)
[09:05:02] <ace_me> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fb079ab37ce0319cc477 Cork now the submit button is disabled after first click but form is not submitted ! can you please loo kagain ?
[09:05:15] <FinalAngel> sorry wrong channel (goes away...)
[09:05:31] <Cork> FinalAngel: i would say wrong platform
[09:05:39] <FinalAngel> aye :(
[09:05:40] <Cork> that is spam, no matter what channel it is in
[09:06:01] <ace_me> :)
[09:06:03] <FinalAngel> still on freenode though
[09:06:11] <Cork> ace_me: you know jqobject.submit() will trigger the same event handler again right?
[09:06:12] <FinalAngel> I'm really _sorry_ about that
[09:06:23] <Cork> FinalAngel: my point is you shouldn't spam any channel
[09:06:41] <Cork> irc isn't a bulletin board for ppl to promote there blogs...
[09:06:45] <ace_me> ok
[09:06:54] <FinalAngel> well it should be added to the cms channel where the development takes place
[09:07:01] <Cork> ace_me: what you want is campaignForm[0].submit()
[09:07:06] <FinalAngel> I assume you promote jquery releases here too?
[09:07:10] <Cork> no
[09:07:31] <Cork> the topic gets updated with the latest version (if someone have the time to)
[09:07:37] <Cork> but promoting with links is just spam
[09:07:40] <FinalAngel> alright, will honor your policy!
[09:11:00] <ace_me> I am still confused Cork  campaignForm[0].submit();
[09:11:05] <sigdk> Cork, This is a very simplified version of my code (I tried to make a small case out of the real 500-line-crap I have): https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/4/
[09:11:11] <sigdk> I'd like some help to refactor it
[09:11:33] <Cork> ace_me: campaignForm.submit(); runs submit on the jquery object, and that is a shorthand for .trigger('submit')
[09:11:40] <Cork> ace_me: so it calls the .submit event handler in a loop
[09:12:00] <Cork> ace_me: campaignForm[0].submit(); on the other hand calls the dom function submit on the first element in the jquery object
[09:12:09] <Cork> ace_me: so that submits the form
[09:12:39] <Cork> ace_me: though that said, you could just reverse the code and not having this problem at all
[09:12:57] <Cork> ace_me: if(!campaignForm.valid()) { e.preventDefault(); }
[09:13:19] <Cork> then you don't need the .submit() call at all
[09:17:47] <ace_me> still not ok https://gist.github.com/anonymous/733588375fe830102a2b
[09:18:24] <Cork> uh
[09:18:30] <Cork> remove line 5
[09:19:21] <taplar> from the short bit of the convo i've seen, the ! is also missing
[09:19:22] <Cork> also the last call should be setTimeout(function() { $('#submit-campaign').prop('disabled', false); }, 100); (or some other number)
[09:19:30] <Cork> ah, true
[09:19:54] <Cork> currently your toggling the state of the button too fast
[09:20:00] <Cork> so nothing will be affected
[09:22:26] <shibly> console.log($('form').serializeArray()); => Array [ Object, Object ] , why? How can i get the value with console.log() ?
[09:22:58] <Cork> shibly: console.log(JSON.stringify($('form').serializeArray()));
[09:23:16] <Cork> or you could just click the Object and inspect it that way
[09:24:21] <shibly> Is there any other way but JSON.stringify ?
[09:24:36] <Cork> not if you want the structure as a string no
[09:25:25] <shibly> console.log($('form').serialize()); => first_name=a&last_name=b , how can i get as json value?
[09:25:40] <Cork> uh, you can't
[09:25:49] <Cork> serialize generates a param string
[09:26:10] <Cork> shibly: why is JSON.stringify a problem?
[09:27:55] <shibly> https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ , this says serializeArray() returns [
[09:27:55] <shibly>   {
[09:27:55] <shibly>     name: "a",
[09:27:55] <shibly>     value: "1"
[09:28:02] <shibly>   },
[09:28:03] <shibly> ...
[09:28:12] <Cork> ya
[09:28:28] <Cork> and that is what you get if you look at JSON.stringify($('form').serializeArray())
[09:28:37] <shibly> But this returns => console.log($('form').serializeArray()); => Array [ Object, Object ] , why? How can i get the value with console.log() ?
[09:28:46] <shibly>     value: "1"Array [ Object, Object ]
[09:28:49] <Cork> cause serializeArray() generates an array of object
[09:28:50] <Cork> +s
[09:28:52] <Cork> not json
[09:28:53] <shibly> Array [ Object, Object ]
[09:29:00] <taplar> that's just the general to string
[09:35:29] <Rokko_11> Hi! I need help for parsing some HTML-Elements and replacing them by grouped regex.
[09:35:40] <Rokko_11> Do you know how to solve this problem?
[09:35:42] <Rokko_11> https://gist.github.com/Rokko11/d8ec5bc3a253f2cc2857
[09:36:06] <sigdk> my code (using DataTables) has the following line: if (typeof (Storage) !== "undefined") { ... what does it mean ? I noticed that this branch is the one to be chosen (always)
[09:36:31] <Cork> Rokko_11: parsing html with regex is normally a bad idea
[09:36:47] <Cork> Rokko_11: html isn't structured enough to be able to safely be parsed by regex
[09:36:49] <taplar> sigdk: typeof == "undefined" means the variable does not exist
[09:36:58] <taplar> so it's making sure it exists
[09:37:10] <Rokko_11> But in this case I exactly know the structure of the text
[09:37:48] <Cork> Rokko_11: ah, you want to regex parse the text
[09:37:56] <sigdk> taplar, which variable in my case ? 'Storage' ?
[09:37:57] <Cork> that just happens to be wrapped by html, well that is safe
[09:38:01] <taplar> sigdk: yes
[09:38:13] <sigdk> taplar, I see no 'Storage' variable in my code
[09:38:41] <taplar> if that logic is evaluating to true then it exists.  it may be a global
[09:38:43] <shibly> Isn't it difficult to parse the output of JSON.stringify($('form').serializeArray() ); ?
[09:38:43] <Cork> Rokko_11: though that said, if you want to do this is a page you are better of just converting the html to dom and then modifying the text
[09:38:46] <Rokko_11> It's just every line of a Java Stacktrace. I would like to link it to somewhere else
[09:38:57] <taplar> shibly: what do you mean?
[09:39:03] <Cork> shibly: why would it be?
[09:39:11] <Cork> its just json
[09:39:20] <taplar> frontend json can be parsed with JSON.parse() or $.parseJSON()
[09:39:28] <taplar> backend there are usually functions to do the same
[09:39:36] <Cork> all languages has it
[09:39:48] <Rokko_11> So replacing the content of a selector is a bad idea?
[09:40:12] <Cork> Rokko_11: your asking about modifying html
[09:40:20] <Cork> and ya, that is a bad idea
[09:40:25] <Rokko_11> ok.
[09:40:29] <Rokko_11> so I try it that way
[09:40:30] <Cork> Rokko_11: modifying the text content of a dom element is fine
[09:41:52] <taplar> sigdk: Storage is a javascript object -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage
[09:42:05] <Tentacled> Is there any better way of targeting "all FOO elements that contain a BAR", than $("FOO").each(function() { if ($(this).find("BAR").length>0) { /* do stuff to $(this) */ } })   ?
[09:42:26] <taplar> Tentacled: what is FOO and what is BAR?
[09:42:38] <Cork> Tentacled: $('.FOO .BAR').closest('.FOO')
[09:43:09] <taplar> what about $('.FOO').has('.BAR') ?
[09:43:12] <sigdk> taplar, i don't get what it practically does
[09:43:16] <Tentacled> <FOO> <BAR></BAR> </FOO>   this needs targeting.  <FOO></FOO> not.
[09:43:23] <Cork> taplar: that will give you true/false if there is one
[09:43:32] <taplar> ah, i thought it was a filter, :(
[09:43:36] <shoky> it is
[09:43:46] <Cork> ah, right sorry
[09:43:55] <Cork> thought of .is...
[09:43:59] <taplar> yay!
[09:44:00] <shibly> [{"name":"a","value":"1"},{"name":"b","value":"2"},{"name":"c","value":"3"},{"name":"d","value":"4"},{"name":"e","value":"5"},{"name":"f","value":"8"}] , what's the way to parse this?
[09:44:26] <shibly> It is the output of stringify
[09:44:35] <taplar> ok, question
[09:44:41] <Tentacled> Cork: huh, .closest() or maybe .parent() alternatively. That could work, even if it's a bit roundabout.
[09:44:41] <taplar> you just made that json
[09:44:46] <taplar> why would you want to parse it?
[09:44:50] <taplar> just use the original objects
[09:45:04] <Tentacled> shibly, eval()?
[09:45:04] <Cork> Tentacled: css can't do reverse css selectors, that is why it has to be like that
[09:45:37] <Cork> Tentacled: the browsers don't allow it cause it would O^2 the amount of work they would have to do to style the page
[09:45:50] <Cork> or actually in some cases even O^n
[09:46:39] <Cork> Tentacled: also .parent() won't work as it will always only grab the parent
[09:46:42] <shibly> How can i get the first value of that array?
[09:46:45] <Cork> not the parent matching the selector
[09:46:48] <taplar> array[0]
[09:46:48] <shoky> uhm. no, not eval()
[09:46:57] <shibly> [{"name":"a","value":"1"},{"name":"b","value":"2"},{"name":"c","value":"3"},{"name":"d","value":"4"},{"name":"e","value":"5"},{"name":"f","value":"8"}] , this array
[09:47:00] <Cork> shibly: you can't its a string now
[09:47:08] <Tentacled> Cork: .parents() then :)
[09:47:15] <taplar> $(form).serializeArray()[0]
[09:47:25] <Cork> Tentacled: that is what closest is, but with more efficient code
[09:47:29] <DelphiWorld> yo jqueryers
[09:47:30] <shibly> Cork: Then what to do? What's the benifit of making stringify ?
[09:47:41] <taplar> if an ajax request needs it
[09:47:53] <Cork> Tentacled: .parents('selector') grabs all parents matching the selector, while .closest('selector') grabs the closest parent
[09:47:53] <Tentacled> Cork: oh, I'd've thought it more efficient to look just up.
[09:48:02] <Cork> Tentacled: it doesn't just look up
[09:48:02] <DelphiWorld> it's pocible to  change the source of a audio  element according to a select element?
[09:48:34] <taplar> DelphiWorld: i would think so.  you should be able to change the src or whatever of that element
[09:48:40] <Cork> Tentacled: .closest/.parents have to loop around cur = elm.parentNode; cur.parentNode <loop>
[09:48:57] <DelphiWorld> taplar: exactly that what i need
[09:49:16] <Cork> shibly: stringify is so you can see it all in the console
[09:49:31] <Cork> shibly: the console minifies what it prints to make it more readable
[09:49:40] <Tentacled> Cork: ah, so both are a bit inefficient in this case. .parents() doesn't stop at the first parent matching, while .closest() looks both up and down even if I only need up... :)
[09:49:46] <Cork> shibly: like i said at the start, you can just click the Array or Object to inspect what they have
[09:49:53] <taplar> closest only goes up
[09:49:55] <Tentacled> Unless I'm mistaking .closest() in that it doesn't ever look down.
[09:49:58] <Tentacled> ^ Ah-ha.
[09:50:09] <Cork> Tentacled: no .closest only looks at parentNode
[09:50:14] <Tentacled> OK, cleared up.
[09:50:23] <Cork> Tentacled: so .closest loops until a parent is matched
[09:50:38] <Cork> Tentacled: while parents collects all parents until it hits document, and then filters the array
[09:51:07] <Tentacled> Yup, thus .closest is EXACTLY a first-choice-exit version of .parents. Perfect.
[09:51:16] <Cork> yup
[09:52:13] <Cork> a side note btw
[09:52:33] <Tentacled> So, @ shibly's issue, what's wrong with eval()ing that if it's a string..? Even if it's horrible <_<
[09:52:45] <taplar> avoid eval()
[09:52:46] <Cork> if $('parent child').closest('parent') or $('parent').has('child') is the most efficient depends on what pattern is the most common
[09:52:47] <shoky> because it's horrible?
[09:53:06] <Cork> Tentacled: eval is always the wrong option
[09:53:20] <shoky> and JSON.parse  parses json just fine, if you wanted to
[09:53:22] <Cork> there are no reason, to ever use it
[09:53:27] <Cork> yas
[09:53:28] <Tentacled> Doesn't jQ use eval internally anyway?
[09:53:30] <Cork> *ya
[09:53:41] <Cork> Tentacled: it uses new Function()
[09:53:44] <Cork> that is close to the same
[09:53:53] <shoky> besides what does what jquery does internally have to do with it..
[09:53:55] <Cork> uh... i think
[09:54:05] <taplar> i think getScript or something does a global eval?
[09:54:12] <Cork> ah, nope sorry it uses eval
[09:54:12] <taplar> iirc
[09:54:14] <shoky> yes, not relevant
[09:54:18] <ace_me> I solved it like this Cork ! It works now but is with on click. what do yo usay ? is ok to keep it like this ?
[09:54:19] <ace_me> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0604a442ac195bc01776
[09:54:29] <Cork> getScript and getjsonp uses eval
[09:54:46] <Cork> ace_me: uh...
[09:54:54] * Cork gives up
[09:55:18] <Cork> ace_me: note that form will submit if it isn't valid
[09:55:40] <taplar> and if it is, it submits twice
[09:56:14] <taplar> lol
[09:58:21] <taplar> also, small note aside from the issue.  but you can use 'this' instead of looking up the id the other two times
[09:59:05] <taplar> i know get by id is fast, but meh, redundancy
[10:03:57] <shibly> Cork: Why are you giving up?
[10:07:33] <shibly> https://bpaste.net/show/c0955e6c6fd5 , how can i see the value of FormData in Network console?
[10:08:15] <shibly> In network console's params window, i see [Object Object]:"" , why?
[10:08:23] <shibly> Why can't i see values?
[10:10:17] <pbiendl> Hey Guys, is there any way to get the height of an image on document.ready? It's neccessary that i get the image dimensions BEFORE document.load happens. In my case it also isn't possible to add a width or height attribute to the image.
[10:10:52] <taplar> you want to know how big an image is..... before the image tells you how big it is
[10:11:33] <pbiendl> Basically yes, like read the meta information of the image before (or while) the browser is downloading it.
[10:12:42] <pbiendl> You can see this behaviour on slow connections: The image isnt shown at all, then the content jumps and some space is reservered where the image will appear, then the image is loaded slowly
[10:13:41] <taplar> i'm not aware of a way to do that
[10:13:56] <taplar> aside from maybe standing up some endpoint that you could hit that would tell you the dimensions
[10:15:03] <shoky> shibly:  you're doing  data: myFormData   instead of  data: fd
[10:15:35] <pbiendl> hm... need to test a little, maybe i can grab the containing element somehow.... i want to achieve some sort of placeholder for the image while it is loading, but it's a responsive page and i don't know (in the script) how big the image will be (or the aspect ratio)
[10:16:02] <shibly> shoky: Yes, i have corrected.
[10:16:32] <pbiendl> If i had the meta data of the image i could wrap the image with jquery and then add the width and height to the wrapper (which has for example a background-color)
[10:18:56] <taplar> if it's a responsive page, i wouldn't see an issue with showing a smaller loading placeholder that grows once the image loads
[10:22:37] <pbiendl> Well, yes - but the image isnt showed at all at some point, then when the browser sends the request, the content jumps
[10:24:29] <taplar> is this heavy image showed on the initial page load?
[10:25:27] <pbiendl> Could be, yes... Think of an CMS, i don't know how the content will look, so i need a "works-everywhere" solution, and thats the problem :)
[10:26:35] <Azitrex> hello guys , how can i to calculate length of a utf-8 characters from a textarea.val() ? i want to limit content length of a textarea to 1024 but in utf-8 not worked , sample code is http://jsfiddle.net/47a7A/2430/   example text is http://fpaste.org/299508/14497605/ with 1026 characters that have 2 characters more than 1024 but js calculated to 875 ! any idea ?
[10:26:49] <pbiendl> But after reading some stuff on the web i don't think theres a way for doing this...
[10:27:19] <pbiendl> I need to look for alternatives... maybe add the width and height in the image rendering (php) or make an ajax call or something#
[10:28:28] <taplar> pbiendl: if you can't preload and you are not allowed to scale the images down, then yeah you'd have to do something else
[10:28:49] <Armin`> Is it possible to use a class name in the text method? That is, $(classname).text(sometext)?
[10:29:11] <taplar> Armin`: yes
[10:29:18] <taplar> $('.someclass')
[10:29:36] <taplar> '.' is for classes, '#' is for ids
[10:30:10] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[10:32:05] <Armin`> for some reason it doesn't work ..
[10:32:18] <Armin`> Do you have any good links for usage of the text method?
[10:32:28] <taplar> make a fiddle.  show us what your trying
[10:32:30] <Xatenev> Armin`: just show us your code
[10:34:11] <Azitrex> Armin`, class selector in jquery is a dot fist of your classname
[10:35:12] <Armin`> http://jsfiddle.net/vdbzpveb/1/
[10:36:00] <taplar> yeah, your not putting a . on your 'classname'
[10:36:12] <Armin`> in the html or js?
[10:36:32] <Armin`> oh crap forgot to add it back in the js, but yeah it still won't work even if its .classname in the js
[10:37:14] <Azitrex> Armin`, change it $(diction[i][0]).text(diction[i][1]);  to $('.'+diction[i][0]).text(diction[i][1]);
[10:38:36] <Armin`> Azitrex: For some reason it doesn't work :s
[10:38:55] <Azitrex> Armin`, key ha masalan ?
[10:39:06] <taplar> oh
[10:39:10] <taplar> you also have an issue with your dictionary
[10:39:18] <taplar> your doing two elements but your missing a comma
[10:39:41] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/vdbzpveb/2/
[10:42:07] <Armin`> taplar: the "It works ENG" doesn't show up when I try to run it myself
[10:42:28] <taplar> i see it at the very top of the page
[10:42:31] <Armin`> the welcome text shows up, but only for a split second and then it just dissapears
[10:44:38] <shoky> uhh jsfiddle's local drafts new feature thing... makes it so you can't know if you're viewing the original fiddle or the one you changed
[10:44:46] <shoky> how annoying
[10:45:32] <taplar> hmm
[10:46:15] <taplar> is that automatic or an option i'm not aware of
[10:46:27] <shoky> automatic, it seems.
[10:47:12] <shoky> if i open your fiddle,  then make some changes to it and click Run.. then i close the tab. and then i re-open YOUR fiddle again - it will not show your fiddle, it'll show my changes. but doesnt tell me that its not your original
[10:47:14] <shoky> very stupid
[10:47:50] <dan2k3k4-away> autocomplete -> doesn't seem to trigger a change event when selecting an item from list, seems to only do that when I click outside the autocomplate
[10:47:51] <taplar> Armin`: on /5 open your console. you have an error
[10:48:31] <taplar> shoky: lol, that's kinda lame.  sometimes you want to ignore what you did and go back to what it was, :S
[10:48:39] <shoky> exactly yea
[10:51:11] <Armin`> Thanks a bunch taplar! Didn't respond earlier, got stuck trying to fix it but it's done now. Thanks again!
[10:52:03] <taplar> cool
[10:52:08] <shoky> it's also really annoying that now i open jsfiddle.net to start a new fiddle
[10:52:20] <shoky> and it'll show whatever i was previously working on, so i have to delete it...
[10:52:22] <shoky> ugh
[10:52:51] <taplar> huh, are you logged in?
[10:52:52] <shoky> there's not even a "New" button
[10:53:03] <shoky> no, it's the new local drafts feature thing
[10:53:06] <shoky> "feature"
[10:53:22] <taplar> hmm, i was just on a fiddle, closed the tab and went to fiddle in a new one and it started out blank
[10:53:43] <dan2k3k4-away> basically I have an autocomplete with change/focus/select/search function events - but the update other parts of the form based on who you pick in the autocomplete ONLY works after you click outside the form "player name" autocomplete text box
[10:53:55] <dan2k3k4-away> like it only runs/updates other parts after lose focus ?
[10:53:57] <shoky> taplar  run it first, then close the tab.. thats what does it for me anyways
[10:54:03] <taplar> k
[10:54:52] <taplar> nope
[10:55:03] <shoky> weird
[10:55:04] <taplar> it hates me.  you in ff or chrome or?
[10:55:10] <shoky> chrome
[10:55:16] <taplar> ah, let me switch
[10:55:16] <pbiendl> taplar: Thx, will try it :) (sry was afk)
[10:56:07] <taplar> nope.  weird
[10:56:17] <shoky> hrm
[10:56:47] <shoky> you can see info about it if you click the little dot on the jsfiddle logo
[10:57:36] <taplar> ah! it did it when i actually started the fiddle.  not viewing someone elses
[10:57:51] <shoky> ah
[11:00:04] <taplar> the one thing i wish they would do is implement a /latest option.  so instead of being in collaborative i could be on /latest and just F5 to see the last modifications someone made
[11:02:21] <shoky> ya, could be nice
[11:26:22] <Azitrex> Armin`, agha hal shud moshkelet ?
[11:36:29] <Xatenev> shoky: taplar: actually i hate the new jsfiddle
[11:36:41] <quiznilo> anyone use flexselect?
[11:36:44] <Xatenev> shoky: taplar the library stuff on tthe left, getting to see your old code hwen you wanna start a new fiddle
[11:36:48] <Xatenev> jSfiddle was quite perfect x)
[11:37:02] <quiznilo> does anyone ever still use flexselect?
[11:37:48] <quiznilo> it works great, I just can't get ad-hoc entry to work
[11:38:35] <quiznilo> is there any better, newer version with more documentation?  google is failing me
[11:39:19] <quiznilo> hmm... I'm peeking at http://techslides.com/list-of-autocomplete-plugins-and-libraries
[11:42:42] <quiznilo> oh... I fixed it
[11:47:26] <Armin`> is it possible to use text() on forms?
[11:47:45] <taplar> probably don't want to
[11:47:49] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[11:50:54] <Armin`> Depending on what language you choose, it should say username and password in english but användarnamn and lösenord in swedish
[11:51:18] <taplar> ok, so yeah, you can use text() but not on the 'form' but on those elements
[11:51:32] <Armin`> Ah
[11:56:43] <MikeD_> if I want to return the dom element without the jquery wrapper, i can use $( ... ).eq(0);  right?
[11:56:57] <taplar> get(0)
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> .get()
[11:57:05] <robertmaxrees> eq gets you the jquery element.
[11:57:13] <MikeD_> thanks
[12:04:38] <cangelosx> I'm having weird behavior on my project where a form's submit button won't submit when I include jquery.min.js
[12:04:42] <cangelosx> works without it
[12:07:58] <robertmaxrees> when you don't include it, open your console and reload the page - do you see any errors?
[12:08:25] <cangelosx> yeah, just another plugin that is trying to use it
[12:08:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have an event listener that prevents the form submit then. or that plugin does it.
[12:09:23] <cangelosx> It's not the plugin. I've tried without it.
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> then there's other code that does it.
[12:09:43] <cangelosx> It's weird because it's fresh off the shelf 2.1.4 jquery
[12:09:46] <robertmaxrees> including jquery by itself wouldn't cause a problem like that unless the file you have has been edited.
[12:09:50] <robertmaxrees> so there's something else at play.
[12:10:29] <cangelosx> I've disabled (commented out) every single script there is except jquery.min.js and still won't submit
[12:10:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[12:10:41] <cangelosx> Enable every other script except jquery and it submits fine
[12:11:06] <cangelosx> one moment
[12:11:43] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: it's a template; how do I paste bin with css?
[12:11:52] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it.
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> and just the relevant bits - otherwise, link to the broken page.
[12:13:11] <cangelosx> oh, holy shit.
[12:13:17] <robertmaxrees> :) figure it out?
[12:13:24] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I commented out a CSS file and it works.
[12:13:29] <cangelosx> ...I don't know how.
[12:13:36] <robertmaxrees> this sounds liek a caching issue.
[12:13:45] <robertmaxrees> link to the page?
[12:14:09] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[12:14:27] <cangelosx>  <link href="js/plugins/gritter/jquery.gritter.css" rel="stylesheet">
[12:14:43] <robertmaxrees> css should have absolutely no impact on page behavior.  it sounds like your browser is caching the page and, when you reload it, you're not actually looking at the most recent versions.
[12:15:05] <cangelosx> Oh. I see. That makes sense.
[12:15:11] <cangelosx> Well, shit. I tried Ctrl+F5.
[12:15:39] <robertmaxrees> chrome is sticky and doesn't always honor that.  do you have a link to the page so i can take a look?
[12:17:57] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: it's back to it again.
[12:18:06] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: page isn't online. hold on.
[12:18:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:18:12] <cangelosx> let me see if I can uploda a fiddle.
[12:18:15] <cangelosx> upload*
[12:18:18] <robertmaxrees> ++ please do
[12:20:31] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: how do I upload css files rather than copying all files into the css box?
[12:20:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't upload them - you can reference them via the "external resources" option.
[12:20:59] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: they're not from a CDN or anything like that
[12:21:16] <robertmaxrees> you aren't putting an entire page in there, right?
[12:22:28] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I am, because when I isolate the form it works
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle really isn't appropriate for that then.
[12:22:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[12:24:10] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: here you go https://jsfiddle.net/dt6op4t0/
[12:24:45] <robertmaxrees> back up - so if you include just jquery and bootstrap, it breaks?
[12:25:37] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: what I sent you is just bootstrap and jquery and it breaks
[12:25:42] <cangelosx> I just noticed something though
[12:25:52] <cangelosx> <div class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons">
[12:25:57] <cangelosx> would that be it?
[12:26:01] <cangelosx> the form is generated
[12:26:04] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't change anything.
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> unless bootstrap is doing something it shouldn't with that.
[12:26:21] <cangelosx> maybe the button thinks its a toggle
[12:26:28] <robertmaxrees> err, wut
[12:26:40] <cangelosx> yep -- that was it
[12:26:51] <robertmaxrees> uh not sure why that would make a difference.
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[12:27:34] <cangelosx> I think if it's a toggle button it won't submit because it's meant to be toggled
[12:27:47] <cangelosx> didn't notice it until I upload the generated code
[12:27:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a bootstrap issue then.
[12:28:09] <cangelosx> yeah, weird
[12:28:36] <cangelosx> it worked when i excluded scripts gradually, and the caching issue might've made me think it was jquery
[12:48:09] <kutenai> Is there an upgrade guide from 1.10.x to 1.11.x or 2.1.x?
[12:48:29] <robertmaxrees> nope - shouldn't need one.
[12:48:57] <kutenai> We have been stuck on 1.x for so long.. and now, finally, our customer base is saying we can drop IE8.. doing a major happy dance.
[12:49:07] <robertmaxrees> then move to 2.x
[12:49:30] <kutenai> So, should be essentially a drop in replacement?
[12:49:35] <kutenai> I like the sound of that..
[12:49:37] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:50:32] <kutenai> Thank you. We will do testing of course, but sounds like we don't need to worry too much..
[12:50:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:54:24] <Aristy> Hey guys, I have an issue with jQuery 1.11.3
[12:54:51] <Aristy> var x = something + "/about?utm_source=some-widget&utm_medium=" + siteID;
[12:54:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery issue.
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[12:55:20] <Aristy> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:
[12:55:38] <Aristy> It only happens when jQuery 1.11.3 is located in page. Works properly with 1.9.*
[12:55:57] <robertmaxrees> needs more context then.
[12:56:32] <Aristy> Uploading stack trace
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> show code.
[12:56:43] <Aristy> https://i.imgur.com/U5KdN6m.png
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[12:56:51] <robertmaxrees> and screenshots are never helpful.
[12:57:09] <robertmaxrees> but trace tells me that something is passing a bad selector to jquery.
[12:57:22] <Aristy> I cannot show the whole code as it's over 5k lines
[12:57:27] <robertmaxrees> i don't want all of it.
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> just the part that's throwing an error.
[12:58:25] <Aristy> https://jsfiddle.net/1x93uh86/
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> and how is aboutURL being used?
[12:59:08] <Aristy> let me update fiddle
[12:59:42] <Aristy> updated
[12:59:52] <robertmaxrees> need to send out the new URL.
[13:00:21] <Aristy> https://jsfiddle.net/1x93uh86/2/
[13:00:46] <Aristy> I guess the special characters create an issue with jQuery's parser
[13:00:48] <Aristy> unsure though
[13:00:57] <robertmaxrees> *sizzle, and yes, that can cause problems.
[13:01:20] <Aristy> How can I avoid it?
[13:01:34] <robertmaxrees> within selectors, at least, but i'm not seeing anyuthing invalid here about your selectors.
[13:01:42] <robertmaxrees> did you remove the other code?  way lost.
[13:01:54] <Aristy> Which other code?
[13:02:20] <Aristy> I can create a new fiddle if you're unable to see it
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> oh you're returning an object, not the aboutURL.
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> this in and of itself shouldn't have any issues.
[13:03:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/1x93uh86/2/ should be fine.  not sure why it's failing - the error you're getting is over a bad selector, but you're not using a selector here soooo
[13:03:39] <Aristy> Let me check what happens to that object, sec
[13:04:21] <Aristy> jQuery("<div/>", {...}).append(this.getLogoModal())
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> still no selector.
[13:06:11] <Aristy> https://jsfiddle.net/1x93uh86/3/
[13:06:14] <Aristy> How about this?
[13:06:32] <Aristy> I just append that value as the src="" value of the link
[13:06:34] <robertmaxrees> are you aware of what a selector is?
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> because your error is in sizzle.
[13:06:43] <Aristy> I never select it though
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> right, so something else is going on.
[13:07:12] <Aristy> Does chrome console show stack trace of the last function call?
[13:07:16] <Aristy> Perhabs I can dig it there
[13:07:34] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[13:11:38] <Aristy> It works when I remove aboutUrl from this piece of code: jQuery("<a/>", {href  : "#", target: "_blank"})
[13:11:44] <shoky> Aristy: it seems your error is related to that featherlight plugin you're using..
[13:11:48] <shoky> fwiw
[13:11:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:11:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at featherlight and see what's up.
[13:12:12] <Aristy> You know what, I'll just pick another modal plugin
[13:12:20] <Aristy> Enough headaches with this one
[13:12:59] <Aristy> Anyway, thanks alot for the help guys. Virtual hugs. :)

[13:50:54] <Domonic> Hi there. I have some images in a list example: <ul> <li><img src="img/pic.jpg"></li> </ul> how can I make the images fade in on page load? at present using this code: $(document).ready(function(){         $("#div1").fadeIn(3000);         $("#div2").fadeIn(3000);         $("#div3").fadeIn(3000);     }); Can I make it work with a list?
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> use css transitions instead.
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> and why wouldn't you be able to make that work with a list?
[13:52:33] <Domonic> so css rasitions
[13:52:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:53:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean transitions?
[13:53:17] <Domonic> Yeah
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.  or just use display: none; on the images and then use fadein against them on pageload.
[14:00:35] <printForever> I'm trying to remove class from Select2, when the dropdown is opening. My code works in the Console but it's not working on the page...
[14:02:56] <shoky> printForever: jsfiddle, mate
[14:03:09] <printForever> shoky, you're my lucky charm!
[14:03:22] <printForever> I opened Select2 file and found it in the code and commented it out
[14:06:19] <robertmaxrees> printForever don't do that.
[14:06:33] <printForever> I would ANY-THING FOR LOVE
[14:06:39] <printForever> but I wouldn't do that
[14:10:19] <Domonic> <robertmaxrees> Thanks that worked.

[14:11:55] <realies> hi
[14:12:20] <robertmaxrees> hai
[14:15:48] * taplar forest gump waves
[14:20:10] <Sino> anyone here have experience with DataTables-rowsgroup
[14:20:29] <robertmaxrees> Sino if you have a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will.
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> though i will suggest going to their forums instead since datatables is weird.
[14:27:07] <taplar> $('i').not('.work').bangOnDrum(allDayCallback);
[14:49:09] <Sino> Hi everyone, I'm trying to figure out why my tables won't sort when using the datatables-rowsgroup plugin, here's a fiddle of what I'm working on, I can't get it to sort by RU while grouping the middle column only http://jsfiddle.net/sexajh2w/
[14:49:25] <Sino> any help would be greatly appreciated
[15:08:01] <realies> can someone give me a tip on  where I could get s similar type of slider?
[15:08:53] <realies> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/25g9Lotz/IMG_0105.PNG
[15:10:20] <realies> I've tried the super simple slider, but it appears to be fading in/out the slides and not sliding them : D
[15:20:59] <realies> no one? :/
[15:23:39] <Vivekananda> how do I get to the progress bar div here ? http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/mdk782p3/1/
[15:26:30] <Vivekananda> nevermind
[15:26:31] <Vivekananda> got it
[15:38:20] <DelphiWorld> hi
[15:38:30] <DelphiWorld> how to get my audio element into a object?
[15:38:30] <realies> hi
[15:38:45] <realies> why not html5?
[15:38:54] <DelphiWorld> i am using html5
[15:39:00] <DelphiWorld> but need to control using js
[15:39:12] <DelphiWorld> document.getElementById('bg_audio').play();
[15:39:25] <DelphiWorld> but i want to assign a object called media so i do just media.play
[15:39:36] <realies> I'd google that
[15:39:46] <AbuDhar> data: { title: $scope.title, content: $scope.content } thiis looks fine as a post parameter?
[15:39:49] <DelphiWorld> i am allready googlin
[15:40:06] <realies> or var media=getobjectbyid
[15:40:14] <realies> then media.play
[15:41:35] <DelphiWorld> realies:        var media = $(this).getObjectById (cast);
[15:41:40] <DelphiWorld> realies: cast is my audio
[15:42:12] <realies> is it working like that?
[15:42:22] <DelphiWorld> didnt try yet i am confirming
[15:43:11] <realies> i wouldn't put (this)
[15:43:31] <realies> but im not that good at writing js without fails : D
[15:44:14] <realies> but yeah, assigning the obj to a var and then calling the methods from that var should work
[15:44:42] <DelphiWorld> i'm confused
[15:47:08] <DelphiWorld> var media = document.getElementById('cast');
[15:47:13] <DelphiWorld> this is correct i think, realies
[15:47:18] <robertmaxrees> not using jquery?
[15:47:46] <DelphiWorld> jquerying
[15:48:00] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById() is a native method.  did you need javascript help instead?
[15:48:05] <DelphiWorld> but everyone say something diferent
[15:48:31] <DelphiWorld> Robdgreat: so what's the equival of this in jquery?
[15:48:41] * Robdgreat shakes his fist at robertmaxrees 
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete, and $('#cast')
[15:48:48] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat ;D
[15:48:55] <DelphiWorld> LOL
[15:48:58] <realies> give that guy a snippet, im tryinna catch my bus :D
[15:49:01] <Robdgreat> It's clearly about time you got your name legally changed
[15:49:05] <DelphiWorld> sory Robdgreat
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> clearly.
[15:49:11] <Robdgreat> haha
[15:49:20] <DelphiWorld> robert_: crapy text to speech
[15:49:31] <robertmaxrees> again?
[15:49:36] <DelphiWorld> you was the only one starting with "rob" befaure so i just autocompleted:P
[15:49:47] <DelphiWorld> ouch.
[15:49:47] <Robdgreat> DelphiWorld: no worries. I'm used to it. It's just fun to give robertmaxrees a bit of good-natured grief
[15:49:47] <robert_> lmao
[15:49:50] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: lol
[15:49:55] <robertmaxrees> always.
[15:50:42] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: so repeat for me, what's the equival of                     var media = document.getElementById('cast'); in jquery?
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> i already told you.
[15:50:51] <DelphiWorld> i want media to be atached to my audio element
[15:50:59] <robertmaxrees> back way up - have a fiddle?
[15:51:00] <DelphiWorld> lot of traffic
[15:51:08] <DelphiWorld> connect & disconnect stress my text to speech
[15:51:21] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: no, i am using ionic
[15:51:36] <robertmaxrees> if your quesiton is about jquery, then you can still make a jsfiddle.
[15:51:57] <realies> whats ionic?
[15:51:59] <DelphiWorld> dont you remember? its accessibility issue
[15:52:03] <robertmaxrees> mobile app framework.
[15:52:10] <DelphiWorld> realies: ionic is a mobile framework to build hibrid app
[15:52:18] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld I barely remember what I ate for breakfast.
[15:52:25] <realies> so you compile an app thats a website wrapper?
[15:52:29] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[15:52:38] <realies> lol
[15:52:38] <DelphiWorld> exactly but native looking
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld otherwise, $('#yourIdHere')
[15:52:47] <realies> wow
[15:52:59] <realies> does that mean that it's multiplatform?
[15:53:04] <DelphiWorld> realies: yes
[15:53:15] <robertmaxrees> it's got its weaknesses though.
[15:53:19] <realies> I need to check that out sometime
[15:53:29] <realies> robertmaxrees: like what?
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> it's really nice for designers, but most developers I know end up leaving it pretty quickly.
[15:53:41] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: so... $(cast).play; ?
[15:54:01] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld are you trying to play the sound?
[15:54:23] <DelphiWorld> i am trying to atach it to a variable first, then use that var to play & pause
[15:54:56] <robertmaxrees> those methods are only available via the raw DOM object, so while you COULD use jquery for it, it's going to add some complexity.
[15:55:08] <realies> DelphiWorld: var player = $.("#cast"); player.play();
[15:55:10] <robertmaxrees> var myThing = document.getElementById('yourIdHere');
[15:55:16] <robertmaxrees> realies that won't work.
[15:55:23] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[15:55:26] <robertmaxrees> .play() won't exist on the jquery object - it's a native dom method.
[15:55:35] <robertmaxrees> var myThing = document.getElementById('yourIdHere'); and then you do myThing.play();
[15:55:39] <realies> well pass it on #420
[15:55:51] <realies> xD
[15:56:38] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: its better to pb my code
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:57:11] <robertmaxrees> what is "pb"?
[15:57:13] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: pb=pastebin
[15:57:19] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: http://paste.debian.net/343086/
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's your question?
[15:57:50] <realies> kekeke
[15:57:52] <DelphiWorld> am i doing something wrong there
[15:58:07] <robertmaxrees> is it working for you ooor...?
[15:58:17] <DelphiWorld> the click? no
[15:58:24] <robertmaxrees> the click or the audio?
[15:58:32] <DelphiWorld> none work
[15:58:34] <shoky> no .playback element...
[15:58:35] <robertmaxrees> did you try usign a console.log() or something similar to see where the issue lies?
[15:58:54] <DelphiWorld> i wish... screen reader's mostly know nothing about js consoles
[15:59:33] <robertmaxrees> okay, so then find a way to confirm?
[15:59:50] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yeah, how? want to browse it?
[16:00:10] <robertmaxrees> not particularly.  i mean, i guess you could use an alert() but those are pretty heavy-handed.
[16:00:40] <DelphiWorld> text to speech software are pretty limited on technical web
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> i understand that - i'm trying to help you find a way to do this on your own so you can independently verify :)
[16:01:13] <DelphiWorld> ya
[16:01:40] <robertmaxrees> so how can we do that?
[16:01:51] <DelphiWorld> i'm thinking;)
[16:02:05] <DelphiWorld> how do i do alert?
[16:02:12] <DelphiWorld> alert (hi!'; ?
[16:02:26] <robertmaxrees> alert('foo');
[16:02:39] <DelphiWorld> you see
[16:02:42] <DelphiWorld> i always miss (à
[16:02:42] <DelphiWorld> ()
[16:03:11] <realies> {}
[16:03:57] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: ok i did alert
[16:03:59] <DelphiWorld> let's see
[16:06:23] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yep, no click is happening
[16:06:38] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think that might be?
[16:06:48] <DelphiWorld> cause i see no alert
[16:06:56] <robertmaxrees> right - so why would no click fire?
[16:07:02] <DelphiWorld> yes
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking you.
[16:07:14] <robertmaxrees> think about reasons why that might be the case.
[16:07:58] <realies> Are you still tryinna sort that player?
[16:08:05] <robertmaxrees> yes - let them figure it out :)
[16:08:11] <robertmaxrees> it's a very simple issue.
[16:08:12] <DelphiWorld> wait...
[16:08:12] <realies> geez xD
[16:09:24] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: lol.
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> :) see the issue?
[16:09:34] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: my <a didnt have a class atached, right?
[16:09:53] <robertmaxrees> not just that - you don't have an opening a tag.
[16:10:13] <DelphiWorld> heck...
[16:10:37] <DelphiWorld> o
[16:11:54] <Vivekananda> hi
[16:17:44] <Vivekananda> not a working fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/osr6L9tL/ . Earlier I could change the value of a bar or line chart and run a script "runAllCharts" and all graphs would refresh, however pie charts here aren't refreshing even though the values get updated in the div. There is a ::after element in the chart in the renedered dom. Can someone point to what it means or should be done?
[16:17:49] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: see  i added the opening of <a tag but nothing. http://paste.debian.net/343087/
[16:18:13] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda we went over this yesterday.
[16:18:34] <Sino> Hi all, Can anyone help me with this?: http://jsfiddle.net/sexajh2w/20/    I'm trying to get the table to be sortable by RU while still having the center row be groupable
[16:18:52] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld right, and you're still missing the class on it.
[16:18:59] <NoiseEee> also not a helpful paste Vivekananda
[16:19:03] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee++
[16:19:09] <DelphiWorld> hold on
[16:19:16] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah. I isolated the function and ran it to initialize the graphs. The method works for bar and line charts. It isn't working for pie. I am using the same technique so thought should ask
[16:19:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> "hey so you shouldn't just re-run the full initialization function for your charts"
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> remember all of that?
[16:20:07] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: could  i remove the <A> and live only the img alone?
[16:20:29] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld it doesn't matter what you target, you just need to target something actually on the page.
[16:20:51] <Vivekananda> yeah I remember. but I am changing All values on the page for all graphs and running the reinitialize function once AFter ALL the changes so that should be good enough no ?
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> you're doing  $(".play").click(function(e) { but there's nothing with that class on the page DelphiWorld
[16:21:09] <DelphiWorld> the img is play no?
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda notice how you're still having issues using that function? ;)
[16:21:15] <DelphiWorld> sory...
[16:21:19] <DelphiWorld> its a id not a class
[16:21:25] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld exactly.
[16:21:38] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: you're getting me up
[16:21:46] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld huh?
[16:22:03] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i'm getting well now cause you cleared something for me
[16:22:23] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you just need to slow down and read your code a little more.  that's all.
[16:22:37] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees:  i am doing
[16:22:41] <Vivekananda> you mean the runAllCharts ? no yesterday the issue wasn't the function but my own stupidity as I wasn't running it in an ajax.done(). AFter I did it it resolved. Also that function works only to initialize graphs and charts and you were correct to say I shouldn't initialize the whole page if I change one value but currenttly I am changing the whole page !!
[16:23:10] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda i'm saying that function is meant for initialization - you're running updates, but okay :) keep beating your head against the wall ;)
[16:25:06] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am confused. Yesterday I ran updates but didn't reinitialize. you said yourself yesterday that after updating values to a graph you ( that means Vivekananda)  aren't seeing it coz it needs to get reinitialized --> hence --> initialization function rerun . What am I missing ?
[16:25:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:25:24] <robertmaxrees> you conflated what i meant.  sorry!
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[16:27:01] <Vivekananda> hmm so I am missing something. I was supposed to reinitilize but not run the initialize function then !! Whew you got me all confused. I hope I get more responses from someone else too
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> i meant you should just run the chart function manually instead of reinitializing the whole page.
[16:27:36] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug)
[16:29:20] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: imagine i want to assign a css class to a element, how would i target it using the id and not the class?
[16:29:29] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld why would you use the ID?
[16:29:48] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you target it however is appropriate at the time - you can use an ID or a Class.
[16:29:49] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees:  example:  <button class="button button-energized">button-energized </button>
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> there's no ID on that element for what it's worth.
[16:30:08] <DelphiWorld> yes i know
[16:30:13] <DelphiWorld> but class is taken by css
[16:30:19] <DelphiWorld> so should i add a id there ?
[16:30:20] <robertmaxrees> so?
[16:30:36] <DelphiWorld> i can use class for both jquery & css?
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[16:30:47] <DelphiWorld> strange
[16:30:51] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> why would that be strange?
[16:31:21] <DelphiWorld> in this case
[16:31:22] <Vivekananda> probably should try js as well. robertmaxrees seems you are the only one here answering things . Interesting coz I remember earlier this channel had lots of people actually talking ( not just listening)
[16:31:35] <robertmaxrees> it's a generic way to reference an element.  also your classes on that button are unusual DelphiWorld
[16:31:35] <DelphiWorld> class="button button-energized" is a css element no?
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld there's no such thing as "a css element"
[16:32:19] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld classes are just a way to reference one or more similar elements.  that reference can be used by js or css.
[16:32:42] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: dan me.
[16:33:01] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: so i target a object in my html using the class name that defined on it
[16:33:08] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld huh?
[16:33:09] <DelphiWorld> regardless css or js.
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, you can target classes, IDs and tagnames using css and JS
[16:34:15] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: if i want to target something using js i use there class name, and if i want to style that element also i use the class name
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld yep.
[16:34:25] <DelphiWorld> clear a lot now
[16:34:34] <DelphiWorld> lightning
[16:39:18] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: corrected the fails but still bad luck... http://paste.debian.net/343103/
[16:39:52] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld is the alert firing?
[16:40:05] <DelphiWorld> i wish, robertmaxrees
[16:40:19] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i'm not talking about audio at this time but about the alert & click
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> you realize your code is malformed, right?
[16:41:45] <DelphiWorld> where?
[16:41:59] <mrkie> i'm having a bunch of .html pages, of each page i need to get all the content between <div class="content_main" id="hoofd_content"> , i want to automatically copy it (to the clipboard or a file), is there any way to do this? so i could make a list of the urls or so
[16:42:17] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you're missing curlies around your conditionals which is bad since they're mutliline blocks, and you're not passing strings to those alert calls.
[16:42:35] <robertmaxrees> mrkake try asking in one channel at a time.,
[16:42:48] <robertmaxrees> err, mrkie
[16:42:57] <mrkie> robertmaxrees: yes, ok
[16:42:59] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: explain again please, where its malformed? alert ('hi!'); its not correct?
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you don't have quotes around the strings.
[16:43:31] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you have alert(Playing!); you need alert('Playing!');
[16:44:02] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: this is the malformated part?
[16:44:13] <DelphiWorld> err, malformed/
[16:44:15] <arc_> looking at your console would have given you a clue about that
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> he said earlier he can't use his console.
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[16:44:35] <DelphiWorld> arc_: screen reader software dont read the js console
[16:44:38] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld that's part of it.  you're also missing curly braces around your conditionals.
[16:44:40] <arc_> i see
[16:44:53] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: line please
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld the part that starts with if (media.paused)
[16:45:12] <robertmaxrees> all of that.
[16:45:46] <DelphiWorld> so i'm missing { } right?
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld a few of them, yes.
[17:18:13] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: sory for disturbing, but using this:$("#ctrl").click(function(){. i'm targetting my object by the class name ctrl right?
[17:18:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:18:32] <robertmaxrees> # is for IDs.  . is for classes.
[17:18:50] <DelphiWorld> ok
[17:18:51] <DelphiWorld> cool
[17:22:12] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: DONE!!!!!!!!
[17:22:40] <robertmaxrees> cool
[17:22:48] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[17:29:30] <stan_man_can_> Is this valid syntax at all? $j("[id$=selServiceLocation]")
[17:29:57] <stan_man_can_> I've never seen a selector look like that before, but it's been a while since I've done front end stuff
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, but why not just use a class?
[17:35:14] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: precisely
[17:35:31] <stan_man_can_> Probably because they were silly and gave a ton of elements the same ID?
[17:35:51] <stan_man_can_> I'll fix it up, I figured it was wrong but wanted to confirm first
[17:36:36] <robertmaxrees> that's an "ends with" selector.
[17:38:56] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: OHHH
[17:39:15] <stan_man_can_> Now know why they did it... Still a bad way to go about it though
[17:39:17] <stan_man_can_> thanks
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> :) exactly.
[17:41:45] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: pretty well going now
[17:41:54] <NitroLiq> Hi all, is there a way to target a device in jquery?
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:42:01] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i can track a <select> element with the same way?
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld you want the change event instead.
[17:42:33] <DelphiWorld> NitroLiq:    explain target a device
[17:42:43] <NitroLiq> For example, I have a simple if statement that does some DOM stuff based on window.width
[17:42:46] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yep, and how to get the value?
[17:42:54] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld $(this).val();\
[17:42:59] <NitroLiq> works fine but on landscape tablet, the number is different
[17:42:59] <robertmaxrees> no \
[17:43:06] <DelphiWorld> fun fun fun
[17:43:11] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i'll play it and come back!
[17:44:03] <NitroLiq> let me put up a quick fiddle
[17:44:41] <NitroLiq> https://jsfiddle.net/u0phphdo/
[17:45:26] <NitroLiq> Okay so basically what the js is doing is moving a standalone menu into a separate navbar at that size
[17:46:50] <NitroLiq> Thing is, while 1008 is perfect for desktop, on ipad landscape, the mobile menu shows and the member menu shows. If I adjust the value to 1040, then it's fine on all mobile. Thus, trying to target them seperately with an ||
[17:48:02] <NitroLiq> 1040 on desktop won't work because it injects my inline menu list into the other menu before switching to mobile causing a glitchy area when resizing
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you using media queries
[17:48:19] <NitroLiq> tried using matchmedia earlier but wasn't working
[17:48:29] <NitroLiq> I'm using both
[17:48:43] <NitroLiq> for different things
[17:49:11] <NitroLiq> There are two menus...a member menu and a Foundation topbar menu as the main menu
[17:49:38] <NitroLiq> The member menu gets detached and moved into the topmenu at the breakpoint
[17:52:05] <NitroLiq> I was hoping there was something like the MQs for min or max-device-width that I could leverage in JS
[17:55:18] <NitroLiq> ECHO...Echo..echooo
[17:56:10] <Zzaichik> is jsfiddle just busted or did I do something to it
[17:56:29] <NitroLiq> You did something to it
[17:56:33] <Zzaichik> dammit, I knew it
[18:17:42] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, i have a issue where  a div isn't updating
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> there are over 600 people in here.
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only person who can help you :)
[18:19:01] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[18:19:22] <robertmaxrees> you can put your question out to the channel - anybody who can help will.
[18:19:38] <DelphiWorld> ok
[18:19:43] <DelphiWorld> guys here's my past: http://paste.debian.net/343122/
[18:20:00] <DelphiWorld> i am binding the audio element to a div
[18:20:04] <DelphiWorld> tracking timecode
[18:20:42] <DelphiWorld> but the progress isn't displaying
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> <audio id="cast" > vs $(".cast")
[18:21:06] <robertmaxrees> that's an ID, not a class.
[18:21:50] <DelphiWorld> so it must be #cast
[18:22:03] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[18:23:55] <DelphiWorld> still nothing updated...
[18:24:14] <robertmaxrees> have you confirmed the binding at least works?
[18:25:16] <robertmaxrees> also, you have lines looking for $(".audio-player") - might want to check that.
[18:25:16] <DelphiWorld> i am allready doing it using alert
[18:26:12] <robertmaxrees> you keep confusing classes and IDs or simply omitting elements entirely.
[18:26:42] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: yes confusing them
[18:27:00] <DelphiWorld> class is "." and id is "#"a
[18:27:01] <DelphiWorld> am i right
[18:27:07] <robertmaxrees> and omitting them - there's no element with the class .audio-player
[18:27:28] <DelphiWorld> yes cause i'm refactoring a old code:P
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> but that's where your issues are coming from - you'd had the same two issues today ;)
[18:28:04] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[18:28:42] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: first pm to you, dont mind.
[18:28:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:29:05] <DelphiWorld> see pm
[18:29:09] <DelphiWorld> its not asking for help
[18:29:21] <DelphiWorld> pmeed only to let you see
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> i avoid clicking on random links that people PM me.
[18:29:49] <DelphiWorld> yes, i am not gonna post the link to my ionic here in public;)
[18:29:54] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:30:05] <DelphiWorld> cause its a live server
[18:30:09] <robertmaxrees> so?
[18:30:10] <DelphiWorld> and all channel will visit it
[18:30:15] <robertmaxrees> nah, they won't.
[18:30:23] <DelphiWorld> ok, i dont mind so
[18:30:29] <DelphiWorld> http://pbx.lntmedia.net:8100
[18:30:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:30:51] <DelphiWorld> this is a media player
[18:30:56] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:32:11] <DelphiWorld> thinking should i do a stop button or stay with play/paose...
[18:32:51] <robertmaxrees> there's an important distinction between those three things.
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> errr, those two things, - pause vs stop i mean
[18:33:30] <DelphiWorld> i know the diference
[18:55:49] <DelphiWorld> done guys, my player is cursing;)
[18:55:53] <DelphiWorld> working pretty well
[18:56:16] <robertmaxrees> girls, on the other hand...
[18:56:29] <DelphiWorld> haha
[18:56:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:56:35] <DelphiWorld> very happy robertmaxrees
[18:56:41] <robertmaxrees> exclusionary languae is a funny thing
[18:57:00] <DelphiWorld> HAHA
[18:57:08] <DelphiWorld> you helped a lot
[18:57:27] <robertmaxrees> err, that's not really a "haha" funny thing, but i'm glad you got what you needed.
[18:57:46] <DelphiWorld> yes i'm pretty happy :P
[18:58:01] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: this is my first time doing a real things with jquery
[18:58:14] <robertmaxrees> err, "real things"?
[18:58:24] <robertmaxrees> and i might check out http://learn.jquery.com/
[18:58:24] <DelphiWorld> yes, a usable app
[18:58:48] <DelphiWorld> when i was comming here i was just modifying existing apps
[18:59:20] <robertmaxrees> that's real work but ok.
[18:59:49] <DelphiWorld> now i'll move to <select> change
[19:00:11] * Miles8of9 searches for jihad-related hidden messages inside code!
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> woah what?
[19:00:47] <DelphiWorld> i mean i'll work on binding to the select list and track change
[19:01:35] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 uh what was that about?
[19:02:12] <DelphiWorld> yes, he listened to the islamic audio
[19:02:53] <Miles8of9> it's some kind of islamic prayer right?
[19:02:56] <robertmaxrees> That seemed like a joke in awfully poor taste.
[19:03:02] <DelphiWorld> yes
[19:03:26] <DelphiWorld> its something that whe say every morning
[19:04:06] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 next time i might rethink posting something like that next time.
[19:04:08] <DelphiWorld> what the hell use of jquery.min.map?
[19:04:25] <DelphiWorld> he should have posted it to  me in pm
[19:04:37] <robertmaxrees> no, he shouldn't have said it at all tbh.
[19:04:48] <robertmaxrees> anyway - DelphiWorld it lets you use the minified version but debug it as if it wasn't minified
[19:04:58] <DelphiWorld> ah thank
[19:06:08] <DelphiWorld> i think Miles8of9 is snyphing all my traffic
[19:06:15] <DelphiWorld> cause i pass through telecom italia;)
[19:06:16] <Simen_> what now DelphiDick?
[19:06:24] <robertmaxrees> woah what was that for?
[19:06:26] <Simen_> :-P
[19:06:26] <DelphiWorld> wb Simen_
[19:06:43] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: Simen_ is my friend, he just joked
[19:06:50] <robertmaxrees> heh alright.
[19:06:51] <Simen_> thanks, but first time here :-D
[19:07:10] <DelphiWorld> Miles8of9 thinking far away, when he listen to any islamic things he think its jihad
[19:07:24] <robertmaxrees> let's drop that subject now DelphiWorld :)
[19:07:43] <DelphiWorld> <action application="drop" data="The Subject"/> ;)
[19:07:43] <Miles8of9> we are a bit scared in our country now....
[19:08:26] <robertmaxrees> so hey let's keep that out of the channel.  thanks!
[19:08:31] <DelphiWorld> <action application="drop" data="The Subject"/> ;)
[19:39:39] <realies> DelphiWorld: <action application="drop" data="the bass"/>
[19:40:05] <DelphiWorld> realies: haha, this xml syntax is from http://www.freeswitch.org/
[19:40:40] <realies> dunno what's that but it seems like a lot of text for 0040
[19:40:43] <realies> :D
[19:40:56] <DelphiWorld> Voice over IP
[19:41:04] <TuxBrother_> I'm looking for a way to parse the DOM and find certain variables, like <tag class="something">...</tag> and then remove the parent element of it. Note that the parent element is a few levels up, because this tag resides within a few other tags. Luckily, I have unique identifiers for the parent tag...
[19:41:07] <realies> isn't that a protocol?
[19:41:25] <DelphiWorld> Voice over ip is a world  not a protocol
[19:41:34] <robertmaxrees> TuxBrother_ do what now?
[19:41:45] <robertmaxrees> TuxBrother_ you have the DOM - you don't need to parse tit.
[19:41:47] <robertmaxrees> *it
[19:41:48] <DelphiWorld> there's hell load of protocols: sip, mgcp, iax, h323, and today's websocket
[19:41:55] <TuxBrother_> So, the whole thing is remove if <tag class="blah">
[19:42:12] <TuxBrother_> robertmaxtrees: OK, search the DOM, then
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> you want to remove a tag if it has a certain class?
[19:42:39] <robertmaxrees> or jusr remove a parent element if it has a certain class?
[19:42:40] <TuxBrother_> robertmaxrees: Yes
[19:42:53] <TuxBrother_> The last one
[19:42:59] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[19:43:17] <robertmaxrees> though actually that probably won't help.
[19:43:25] <TuxBrother_> Correct
[19:43:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably have to .parent() up from the found node, grab the .children(), .append() that do the now current .parent(), and then .remove() the element you don't want.
[19:43:59] <TuxBrother_> If the tag has "blah", I just want to remove the entire parent tag including what I found
[19:44:09] <robertmaxrees> oh, then .parent().remove()
[19:47:27] * DelphiWorld is lost in the jQuery ocean
[19:52:58] <DelphiWorld> could someone check why my select list isn't firing the .change event? http://paste.debian.net/343138/
[20:04:00] <realies> breakpoints maybe?
[20:04:02] <realies> going to bed
[20:04:05] * realies cya soon
[20:04:09] <DelphiWorld> lol
[20:04:16] <DelphiWorld> see ya realies
[20:11:30] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld what do you think i'm going to tell you?
[20:20:10] <DelphiWorld> the .change event of my select isn't firing if i dont click a link... strange
[20:20:22] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:20:40] <robertmaxrees> $('#playlist') vs <select class="playlist">
[20:20:55] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: old code
[20:20:58] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: http://paste.debian.net/343143/
[20:21:41] <robertmaxrees> okay - and you're saying that event doesn't fire unless what?
[20:22:01] <DelphiWorld> should  i just select the element or i press on it?
[20:22:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:22:15] <robertmaxrees> you have to change the option.
[20:22:29] <DelphiWorld> if using keyboard and select a element from my list should i just select or press enter
[20:22:38] <robertmaxrees> you have to press enter.
[20:22:43] <robertmaxrees> at the very least.
[20:22:49] <DelphiWorld> ah
[20:22:54] <DelphiWorld> so  its functional
[20:22:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're not changing anything.
[20:23:05] <DelphiWorld> i will try using iOS to confirm
[20:27:14] <DelphiWorld> thanks
[20:27:19] <DelphiWorld> its exactly working
[20:53:18] <garrettw> so I don't know any jquery but i'm trying to customize a wordpress template that uses it. basically I have a menu bar that sticks to the top of the screen when you scroll down past it - and when it goes to sticky mode, I want the site logo to fly into the bar from the left, to bump the links over a bit and sit next to them.
[20:53:39] <garrettw> and I have no idea how to accomplish this
[20:54:53] <flevver> hey guys, i wanted to install nodejs for windows, but their links are broken, can anyone giveme direct linke to msi?
[20:57:20] <flevver> never mind, found it
[20:59:08] <garrettw> here's the current jquery... just need to add more to it somehow
[20:59:09] <garrettw> http://hastebin.com/bemipekepu.vhdl
[21:09:32] <robert_> $.parseXML() is returning null when I try and parse this data- http://gxy.psiglenmere.com/drugList.xml
[21:31:05] <PabloR> Anybody could tell me how to write the following in plain vanilla JS?
[21:31:07] <PabloR> $("button").on('click', function() {
[21:31:07] <PabloR> var val = $(this).text();
[21:35:17] <rcyr> document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function(event) { var target = event.currentTarget, val = target.innerText || target.textContent; }, false);
[21:41:59] <PabloR> rcyr: thanks!
[22:28:28] <garrettw> how would I change the src attribute of an img tag in jquery
[22:29:08] <garrettw> I know I can do $('.css-selector').somethingHere.........
[22:29:22] <garrettw> just don't know what comes next after the selector
[22:30:13] <garrettw> it wouldn't be $(...).src('new.jpg'); would it?
[22:32:04] <shoky> garrettw: .attr('src', 'new.jpg')
[22:32:22] <garrettw> ah ok thx
[22:32:54] <garrettw> I don't know this stuff, just trying to tweak a wp template
[22:33:38] <shoky> ok
[22:34:00] <garrettw> so now what if I want the image to fade through that change
[22:34:07] <garrettw> so that it's not abrupt
[22:35:20] <shoky> you can animate opacity of one element from 1 to 0 and another from 0 to 1,  e.g. with .animate()
[22:35:41] <garrettw> hmm yeah I guess it would have to be that way
[22:35:59] <garrettw> but both .animate()s need to run at the same time
[22:36:33] <shoky> they do, by default, so you're good
[22:36:51] <garrettw> oh? hmm
[22:38:35] <shoky> can also use css transitions for the opacity animation, and just call addClass/removeClass/toggleClass from js
[22:38:41] <garrettw> ok so i'll need to put both images in the same place, and then I can actually just fade the top one between 0 and 1
[22:40:52] <shoky> yea that works
[22:43:28] <C0nundrum> has anyone used nvd3 ?
[22:59:57] <printForever> row call
[23:00:39] <printForever> Can I listen to a specific element on ajaxComplete instead of 'document'?
[23:04:24] <shibly> Is $(document).ready(function(){}); must before all jquery code?
[23:04:46] <printForever> it has to be AROUND the jQ code
[23:05:29] <shibly> Is it must?
[23:05:36] <printForever> no
[23:06:54] <shibly> Once it didn't work without $(document).ready()
[23:07:04] <printForever> sure
[23:26:31] <printForever> is anyone up?
[23:26:57] <printForever> I'm trying to figure out how is the content change inside the tab content area
[23:26:58] <printForever> https://www.veebimajutus.ee/domeeni-registreerimine/?domain=selleedomaain&tld=ee
[23:39:38] <printForever> since each time the tab content is reloaded, my changes are removed
[23:39:49] <printForever> I have ajaxComplete, but it's not catching changes on the div
[23:40:18] <printForever> I assume that tab content is stored in some variable...
[23:59:45] <robert_> $.parseXML() is returning null when I try and parse this data- http://gxy.psiglenmere.com/drugList.xml
