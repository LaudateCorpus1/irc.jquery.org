[02:32:58] <D-rex> Im sitting at my computer
[02:33:26] <AcidRain> http://pastebin.com/H1pQi81n  so ive just devised this lil script here. how can i capture the click event for all of them instead of the last created one?
[02:33:39] <AcidRain> there has to be a way to load them into an array or something
[02:36:59] <D-rex> $('.notification').each(function(index, value){ doShit })
[02:37:45] <D-rex> $('.notification').each(function(index, value){ $(this).click(function(){} })

If I print the whole page with ctrl+P it show right format of print but I have to print a div which have multiple things inside of Ajax data a card an
[02:37:52] <aarya> d rows etc. I tried a lot of things but not helpful, any help will be helpful.

[02:42:14] <D-rex> aarya: not to sure what you mean by that
[02:44:25] <aarya> I have a bill page printing all bill information using AJAX get with css included in jquery function
[02:44:45] <aarya> now I want to print that particular div
[02:45:37] <aarya> Now issue is that when I used jquery function to print that div, I got all the data but css is completely missing
[02:47:38] <aarya> while, if I print with ctrl+p option than whole page print looks like as desired
[02:47:45] <aarya> got it or not?

[02:53:50] <arc_> isn't that the opposite of the stated problem
[02:54:23] <arc_> maybe not, who knows
[02:56:26] <aarya> Let me try, but not sure will it work I have tried a something like this
[02:56:31] <aarya> thanks
[03:04:58] <renka> good morning. :)
[03:07:17] <aarya> Hi D-rex, I tried first answer and it did not print anything
[03:07:26] <aarya> trying other options too
[03:10:40] <jomofcw> Morning =).
[03:30:05] <jomofcw> Is that the "official" website for Jquery Easing, please : http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ ?
[04:05:05] <gregj> why wouldn't this work in jqueryui  ? $("<div class='bl blue'>x</div>").draggable().position(event.pageX, event.pageY).appendTo("#organiser_table");
[04:11:12] <GuessX> gregj why not just use the handler $('.bl blue')?
[05:37:11] <DMatos91> Hey guys. I'm building a website with a lot of jquery animations and I'm having trouble. I have a main menu; when I click on one of the options, the menu itself fades out and the elements of that section start appearing one by one, using the callback function. This works fine. Then when I click on the website logo, I want to reverse the process. That works fine too.
[05:37:38] <DMatos91> But then if I want to go back to a section, the menu acts weird. Sometimes it won't fade out, sometimes the section appears and others don't
[05:38:03] <DMatos91> It is fine though if I wait a long time before returning to the section, so I guess there's something running in the background still, but I can't figure out what
[05:39:13] <DMatos91> Is there any way I can check if jQuery is doing something, or to print the animations queue?
[06:25:13] <wild_oscar> I have a refactor conundrum that you might be able to help me with. consider this: https://jsfiddle.net/mmalmeida/pmd9geqh/
[06:25:14] <wild_oscar> the $(.module).change(...) code is repeated in more than one location in my code. since it's doing the same thing, I'd like to refactor it to a single location. I created this QustionLoader function, so that instead of repeating the code in several locations,I'd just do QuestionLoader.init().
[06:25:14] <wild_oscar> however, there is a small difference (lines 9-10): in some pages, I want var crfId to be loaded with the option coming from select (line 9). in other places, it's already defined on page load (in which case I could set it on the html and pass it via, e.g, a map, to the init function.
[06:25:33] <wild_oscar> how would you advise me to solve this?
[06:32:44] <sigdk> I advice you to write books, not jsfiddles. Go home oscar, you 're drunk!
[06:33:42] <wild_oscar> sigdk: ?
[06:33:58] <sigdk> I'm kidding... because of your nickname :)
[06:34:04] <wild_oscar> ah!
[06:34:40] <wild_oscar> the times are changing...writers need to make a living as programmers :)
[06:42:25] <wild_oscar> but concerning my question: I tried using var crfId = map['crfId']; and put map['crfId']="$(this).find('option:selected').data('crfid');" - but this isn't evaluated when the page is loaded, so the var crfId will actually have that string, and not its evaluation
[06:57:36] <Tennis> how can i .split by comma and semicolon
[06:57:43] <Tennis> it was something like this (\,|\;)
[07:06:23] <Duikb00t> yo
[07:07:16] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/stkexw/  Ha someone an idea how to accomplish this
[07:19:04] <wild_oscar> if var map = {}; map["xxx"]='foo', what is the correct way of accessing foo - map["xxx"] or map.xxx ?
[07:29:10] <Duikb00t> wild_oscar:  I think.. the '.' dot method
[07:32:25] <wild_oscar> thanks Duikb00t
[07:59:29] <Xatenev> Duikb00t: i dont understand what you want
[07:59:39] <Xatenev> Duikb00t: if that is still open^^
[08:00:29] <Duikb00t> It's fixed

[08:08:35] <SunDown> hello
[08:10:12] <SunDown> so i have this back to the top button that works and sends me straight to the top but i want to add smooth scrolling all the way to the top, i tried some ways but it ignores the amount of time i put there and just jumpss to the top
[08:10:23] <Abhijit> hi
[08:10:24] <SunDown> any advice ?
[08:10:43] <Abhijit> how can i troubleshoot my radiobuttons who dissappear after i try to initialize it with input.icheck library?
[08:11:10] <Xatenev> SunDown: show the code you tried
[08:11:26] <SunDown> kk im just opening jsbin , one sec
[08:14:34] <Abhijit> nvm. solved.
[08:26:01] <SunDown> http://jsbin.com/rebuzanoxi/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:27:09] <SunDown> ive tried slow also instead of the 500
[08:27:17] <SunDown> and it doesnt do much
[08:28:29] <SunDown> http://jsbin.com/rebuzanoxi/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:28:38] <SunDown> that one has more text
[08:34:25] <SunDown> even if i put event.preventDefault(); it still just jumps
[08:35:16] <decx> no jquery included,  referened an id up-btn instead of a class
[08:37:02] <SunDown> what?
[08:37:21] <SunDown> i dont need the jquery reference?
[08:37:30] <SunDown> and i should id it instead of a class?
[08:38:09] <SunDown> it still doesnt work
[08:38:31] <decx> still no jquery
[08:38:41] <decx> and your click doesnt pass the event argument
[08:38:49] <decx> so preventDefault does nothing
[08:39:31] <shoky> printForever: yes
[08:42:42] <noregret> is it ok to place several $(document).ready(function() {..}); in a single page?
[08:43:24] <shoky> it's ok but there's no reason to, really
[08:43:28] <SunDown> im starting with jquery so im not that good yet
[08:43:57] <decx> for starting out i recommend actually including jquery
[08:44:55] <SunDown> you mean in my page?
[08:45:17] <SunDown> the <script>js/jquery.min.js</script>?
[08:45:26] <decx> it's a joke because you still havent found the ad library button in jsbin
[08:45:37] <SunDown> oh
[08:45:38] <SunDown> lol
[08:45:43] <SunDown> very new <
[08:46:12] <decx> there you go
[08:46:14] <SunDown> OHHH
[08:46:25] <SunDown> it works !!!
[08:46:32] <decx> ok event is not a global variable in most browsers
[08:46:35] <SunDown> this is so painful lol
[08:46:38] <decx> so you have to pass the event argument
[08:46:42] <decx> to be able to use it
[08:46:51] <decx> click(function(event)
[08:46:52] <SunDown> example?
[08:47:29] <ohcibi> event is not a global variable in most browsers m(
[08:47:53] <decx> well in all but one ^^
[08:48:08] <noregret> shoky: the page is getting pretty big with a lot of elements, so scrolling back and forth is annoying, that's the only reason.
[08:49:11] <shoky> having multiple $(document).ready will be more annoying ;p
[08:49:46] <decx> it makes no difference
[08:50:14] <decx> like if you have a bunch of js files, nobody will get hurt if they have their own ready
[08:50:21] <shoky> except your brain
[08:50:40] <decx> i dont see a difference, would wrap in iife anyway
[08:51:03] <shoky> it changes when your code is executed
[08:52:40] <shoky> e.g.   $(doc).ready( A );   B;   $(doc).ready(C);    D;         order your code is executed can be  A,B,C,D  or maybe it iwll be  B,D,A,B  or even A,B,D,C in some situations
[08:52:55] <shoky> and that's just with 2 doc.ready's
[08:54:13] <shoky> why use doc.ready at all these days, when you can just put your scripts at the end of <body>
[08:54:24] <shoky> and not care/think anymore in your life about doc.ready
[08:57:03] <noregret> shoky: so i shouldn't add another $(document).ready and just write the JS within the <script> tags?
[08:58:31] <ohcibi> decx: are you talking about the "event"-parameter that is often used as a name for event-callbacks?
[08:58:48] <ohcibi> like in click(function(event))
[08:58:49] <shoky> noregret: you should put your js within a .js file  which you include at the end of <body> tag
[08:58:57] <decx> ohcibi: old ie had a global event variable that you had to get coordinates from
[08:59:07] <shoky> noregret:  <body> ..........   <script src="script.js"></script> </body>
[08:59:30] <shoky> noregret: and then you can remove all $(document).ready and forget about it
[08:59:30] <ohcibi> decx: tha even doubles my m(
[08:59:33] <ohcibi> 8-)
[08:59:37] <decx> hehe
[09:00:02] <SunDown> i still cant get it to animate on my website.. argh
[09:00:11] <SunDown> it does it on jsbin but not my website
[09:04:12] <SunDown> is there a reason why it wouldnt work on firefox
[09:04:13] <SunDown> ?
[09:04:30] <SunDown> i think it works on chrome
[09:04:36] <SunDown> but not firefoz
[09:04:40] <SunDown> firefox
[09:05:55] <decx> you probably still didnt add the event attribute
[09:06:22] <decx> does chrome automagically use 'event' without passing it?
[09:06:37] <decx> seems like it in your bin
[09:07:25] <SunDown> OHHH
[09:07:30] <SunDown> yeah i havent added it
[09:07:34] <SunDown> what do i add?
[09:07:42] <SunDown> <_<
[09:08:14] <SunDown> yeah internet explorer adds it also
[09:09:30] <decx> what's stopping you
[09:09:37] <decx> do you not know how arguments work?
[09:10:27] <SunDown> im learning as i go, but ill look it up right now
[09:10:47] <SunDown> i just set myself a project and starting building it .
[09:10:51] <decx> that's good
[09:11:09] <SunDown> have learned a lot but a lot is new but i find its how i learn best
[09:11:22] <decx> same
[09:12:00] <SunDown> im basically done with a portfolio website, the back to the top button is my last piece
[09:12:16] <SunDown> i need to find hosting and ill put it up
[09:12:30] <SunDown> no idea how but thats the fun of it  :)
[09:13:30] <decx> do you use the console yet?
[09:13:49] <mrjigga> how do you execute a simple show hide jquery function within a header.php file
[09:13:54] <mrjigga> where do I put the script do I have to echo it?
[09:14:05] <SunDown> what console?
[09:14:17] <decx> all browsers have a console
[09:14:27] <decx> you can use it to print stuff
[09:15:35] <SunDown> the developer tools like when you right click and inspect?
[09:15:42] <decx> yes
[09:15:56] <SunDown> yeah ive used that a lot
[09:16:04] <SunDown> very helpful
[09:16:24] <decx> ok then check out your console in the devtools here after you click https://jsfiddle.net/decx/y17ae3xj/
[09:16:25] <mrjigga> do you have to echo a jqeury show hide script into a php file
[09:18:02] <SunDown> okay now what?
[09:18:18] <mrjigga> im trying to put a show hide into a header php file
[09:18:33] <decx> that's the first argument in this function, which has a lot of properties oyu can use and methods that are attached to it
[09:18:45] <decx> like preventDefault()
[09:19:36] <decx> mrjigga: you put it in the footer
[09:19:55] <mrjigga> do i have to echo it
[09:20:49] <decx> well you echo a script tag sure
[09:20:56] <decx> doesnt matter if you have a file or inline
[09:21:14] <decx> unless you're on wordpress where you should enqueue
[09:21:23] <mrjigga> http://pastebin.com/Ftb2xchy
[09:21:36] <decx> yeah register your style
[09:21:39] <decx> and enqueue
[09:21:43] <decx> then enter #wordpress ;)
[09:21:43] <SunDown> im a little bit lost lol, i use the elements a lot for css but console i havent used
[09:22:00] <mrjigga> you cant just echo a simple show hide jquery function
[09:22:03] <SunDown> i clicked it but its empty
[09:22:04] <decx> SunDown: using the console like this will help you solve almost any problem
[09:22:05] <mrjigga> why do I have to enque
[09:22:21] <SunDown> i see
[09:23:27] <decx> mrjigga: prevents double loading
[09:23:37] <SunDown> hummm
[09:23:49] <mrjigga> can u look at that paste bin i showed u
[09:24:01] <mrjigga> how do i structure the echo at the bottom of the file
[09:24:34] <decx> you dont have to worry about that
[09:24:46] <decx> just register and enqueue in your functions.php
[09:24:55] <decx> read codex, be happy
[09:25:09] <mrjigga> that is unecessary
[09:25:39] <mrjigga> you HAVE to enque and all this bullshit for a simple jquery show hide to be slipped into your header.php
[09:25:44] <mrjigga> come on son
[09:25:53] <mrjigga> cant I just echo that shit somehow ez pz japaneezy
[09:26:27] <decx> it is easy yes
[09:26:28] <Xatenev> mrjigga: enqueuing something is pretty simple
[09:26:42] <Xatenev> takes you like 15s
[09:27:02] <mrjigga> ok 15 seconds
[09:27:05] <mrjigga> what do I do
[09:27:25] <Xatenev> enqueue the script in your functions.php
[09:28:01] <decx> codex wp_register_style go from there
[09:29:45] <mrjigga> when were talking about the script, we're talking about the show hide functionality, thats being enqued?
[09:38:32] <SunDown> im still not sure what to do about my scroll to top button not working on firefox
[09:38:59] <SunDown> some articles say its cus firefox uses the html tag and chrome and IE use the body one
[09:39:00] <trudko> hi everyone , anybody here familiar with http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/? For whatever reason it does not initialize on Ipad but does initiliaze in Ipad view in chrome dev tools. here is te code http://pastie.org/10754989
[09:39:14] <decx> SunDown: it works fine on ff with the event argument
[09:39:31] <SunDown> the one you linked me ?
[09:39:46] <decx> no in your bin
[09:41:27] <SunDown> it doesnt on my computer
[09:41:30] <SunDown> humm
[09:41:42] <SunDown> it scrolls on other browsers
[09:43:46] <SunDown> i found this jsfiddle online
[09:43:47] <SunDown> http://jsfiddle.net/Hb3qf/1/
[09:43:52] <SunDown> would that work?
[10:15:54] <SunDown> i got the scroll thing to work but i just notice that on firefox my menu wont work properly
[10:16:17] <SunDown> from top to bottom it works but bottom to top it doesnt
[10:16:19] <SunDown> why?
[10:20:58] <dmatos91> Guys, I'm having trouble and it's buggling my mind. Can anyone have a look at the website and recreate the following steps? 1. Wait for intro | 2. Click on 'Serviços' | 3. Wait for animation | 4. Click on top left logo | 5. Wait for animations | 6. Click on 'Serviços' again : http://vmseguranca.pt/wp/
[10:21:33] <dmatos91> Why isn't the menu fading out and the section fading in like it did previously? All the other sections have the same code logic and are working  fine.
[10:47:52] <oaulakh> will anyone tell why this form validation not working? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PNzZMo
[10:53:24] <crackfox> Seeing different behavior with .filter(":visible") in versions 2.1.4 and 2.2.0 in Chrome - anyone have some insight?

[10:53:39] <crackfox> 2.2.0 appears to be broken based on the jquery doc
[11:03:17] <geri> hi Dev0n
[11:03:50] <geri> hi decx
[11:06:30] <chojo> hi guys, what's wrong with this: $('#site-wrapper').css("min-height","$('#site-wrapper').height() + 150");
[11:06:59] <William|i7> "$('#site-wrapper').height() + 150"
[11:06:59] <chojo> it should just add css property min-height current height plus 150px
[11:07:03] <William|i7> no quotes on that chojo
[11:07:21] <William|i7> $('#site-wrapper').css('min-height',$('#site-wrapper').height() + 150);
[11:08:57] <chojo> williamli7, thanks a lot!
[11:09:07] <William|i7> np
[11:09:56] <decx> cache your collections plz
[11:10:04] <decx> even collections of 1
[11:10:29] <decx> hi geri
[11:12:41] <chojo> Williamli7, does this script overwrite exisiting min-height property?
[11:13:10] <chojo> i have an existing min-height on #site-wrapper and i want to override it
[11:13:56] <crackfox> that's exactly what it does.  it sets the min-height.
[11:14:15] <William|i7> ya
[11:14:35] <William|i7> itll manually set css, iirc it puts it on the style tag
[11:14:59] * William|i7 got his new plugin featured on a site and is hustlin to make it better lol
[11:15:32] <crackfox> what's the plugin?
[11:15:32] <chojo> strange, it doesnt seem to override it. should i have to remove the existing min-height css property before adding the new one?
[11:15:45] <William|i7> https://github.com/Askedio/jQuery-Cruddy
[11:15:48] <crackfox> no
[11:15:56] <William|i7> didnt intend itd get put on some site so soon :(
[11:16:11] <William|i7> noticed randon names on the live demo and was like wth is going on
[11:16:29] * William|i7 was hoping for a code review before that happend
[11:16:42] <crackfox> pretty cool
[11:16:55] <William|i7> thanks
[11:16:56] <crackfox> is it bound to anything in the back end?
[11:17:12] <William|i7> it uses a json api im writing
[11:17:30] <William|i7> but the plugin sposed to be generic, let you use your own api/fields/results
[11:17:37] <crackfox> even better
[11:17:39] <crackfox> nice
[11:17:48] <William|i7> right now its sorta hard-coded for my responses
[11:17:51] <William|i7> but after today :D no more
[11:17:58] <William|i7> goal is for the plugin to be standalone
[11:18:07] <William|i7> easy to adapt to your api
[11:38:49] <sigdk> Is there something obvious that I don't see here: http://paste.debian.net/413920/   ? The second version is wrong, the server reads null when accesses the act
[11:47:29] <William|i7> sigdk iirc data is sent in the body
[11:47:40] <William|i7> so maybe your server is looking for the get request
[11:47:46] <William|i7> not the body/post ?
[11:48:05] <William|i7> not sure, just a thought ( i need coffee)
[11:49:06] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/option/ajax for documentation.
[11:49:12] <robertmaxrees> really wish they'd just make an irc channel already.
[11:50:12] <William|i7> ya i gave up on datatables lol
[11:50:23] <William|i7> sorta dislike it now
[11:53:19] <sigdk> William|i7, I'm doing a get request... Why did you say I'm doing post ? Or I understood something wrong
[11:53:48] <William|i7> Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests.
[11:53:51] <William|i7> oh sorry iw as wrong neway
[11:56:41] <sigdk> the variable is not sent at all... robertmaxrees I've seen that
[11:57:08] <robertmaxrees> sigdk (shrug) this isn't a datatables support place so i'm pointing you to somewhere you're more likely to get help :)
[11:57:58] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, yeah I know... tbh, I know how to make it work. I'm just wondering why is wrong the other way
[11:59:57] <QssT> I have a problem
[12:00:10] <QssT> script breaks in ie8 becasue it says it doesn't support action addevenlister()
[12:00:21] <robertmaxrees> QssT are you using jquery?
[12:00:23] <QssT> which jquery version should I use for ie8 to uspport this?
[12:00:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't use addEventListener in IE8...
[12:00:42] <QssT> yes
[12:00:46] <QssT> I know.
[12:00:55] <QssT> so what can I do to by pass that functin.
[12:00:56] <robertmaxrees> if you include jquery, you need to use .on() - use the most recent 1.x version.
[12:01:10] <QssT> its something that is inside the jquery file itself and not somethign I have written
[12:01:17] <QssT> so I bascailly need another version of jquery
[12:01:20] <robertmaxrees> use the 1.x version.
[12:01:22] <QssT> i am using 1.11.3
[12:01:29] <robertmaxrees> then something else is wrong.
[12:02:12] <QssT> currently using ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js
[12:02:22] <QssT> what should I use instad to fix this problem in ie8?
[12:02:39] <robertmaxrees> show us the error.
[12:02:42] <robertmaxrees> because it should be fine.
[12:02:57] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:06:31] <QssT> error is this? addEventListener - Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener'
[12:07:30] <QssT> anyone?>
[12:08:09] <QssT> is it 1.3.2 the fix?
[12:10:53] <William|i7> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1695376/msie-and-addeventlistener-problem-in-javascript
[12:10:58] <William|i7> n IE you have to use attachEvent rather than the standard addEventListener
[12:11:22] <William|i7> but ie8 deving.. lol hope you're being paid
[12:13:47] <robertmaxrees> William|i7 i have to support IE8 as well ;)
[12:13:53] <robertmaxrees> and jquery makes that MUCH easier.
[13:07:33] <Ben_1> hi
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> hello
[13:10:06] <Ben_1> I try to get the eventoutput from Java jersey via ajax and recognize when jersey sends something to the client
[13:11:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:11:11] <Ben_1> so I wrote this code http://pastebin.com/UUkNb1hW in java
[13:12:07] <Ben_1> and this in jquery http://pastebin.com/n7w5174W
[13:12:32] <robertmaxrees> so jersey is just a way to expose data, right?
[13:12:45] <Ben_1> yes, it's a java REST API
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what's the issue you're having?
[13:12:53] <Ben_1> it provides server sent events
[13:13:20] <Ben_1> the issue is, that my client won't recognize when something is sent
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> so ajax isn't how you do that.
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> what you're looking for is something like sockets.
[13:13:40] <Ben_1> in java the method send is called but my jquery would not recognize
[13:14:15] <robertmaxrees> i assume this send method is trying to push to the browser, right?
[13:14:23] <robertmaxrees> not just respond to a request?
[13:15:33] <Ben_1> mh yes, it is something like an eventchannel which is open the whole time
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> right, so jquery doesn't really do that.
[13:18:49] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: yo! I remember you advised me not to use success on the $.ajax({}) but use done instead
[13:18:57] <thinkxl> can you remind me why?
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> or .then.
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> the deferreds system, basically.
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> buy into promises :)
[13:19:29] <thinkxl> it's .then and .catch
[13:19:30] <thinkxl> right
[13:19:56] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> deferred.then( doneFilter [, failFilter ] [, progressFilter ] )
[13:20:03] <thinkxl> well, that's not the point, you mentioned some valid points
[13:20:04] <thinkxl> about it
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> it's muuuch cleaner to use imo.
[13:21:52] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: got it, that helps
[13:21:56] <thinkxl> thank you sir
[13:22:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[13:27:34] <RudyValencia> So I'm trying to post a form to a PHP service using the jQuery $.ajax() call, but the service does not receive any data; what could possibly be happening?
[13:27:47] <robertmaxrees> tons of things.
[13:28:04] <robertmaxrees> malformed ajax call.  cors.  server-side isn't looking at the data correctly...
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab - are you getting a 200?
[13:30:57] <momomo> anyone knows anything of stalled requests in chrome ?
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> momomo could be lots of reasons.
[13:31:29] <momomo> i need my resource on the  serve to block response until it becomes readdy .. it may take more than 10 seconds but chrome is aborting the request
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> is this via ajax or...?
[13:33:20] <momomo> it's a separte js plugin that is making the equest, looks like an xhttprequest .. get
[13:33:28] <skinux> What's the easiest way to select the form element which is parent to submit button?
[13:33:31] <robertmaxrees> momomo so not jquery related?
[13:33:39] <robertmaxrees> skinux check out .closest()
[13:33:49] <momomo> not really, but people here usually are bit more skilled than the noobs at web
[13:33:50] <momomo> :P
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> momomo i might check out ##javascript.
[13:34:11] <momomo> ah, yes
[13:34:59] <momomo> i'll try my luck there
[13:35:01] <momomo> thanks
[13:35:25] <skinux> Hmm
[13:37:04] <skinux> Reason I need this, is for an unlimited number of forms, each with save and delete buttons. I need to set form action according to which button was clicked and then submit form.
[13:37:20] <robertmaxrees> skinux bind to the form's submit handler instead.
[13:38:22] <skinux> Can I just bind to ANY forms button element, and check the value of the button clicked?
[13:38:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you're ignoring my advice.
[13:39:07] <skinux> Can there be more than one submit ?
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> you have multiple forms, right?
[13:39:25] <skinux> Yeah.
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> then yes.  you can bind to each form's submit event.
[13:39:55] <skinux> So, needs to be a line of JS for each form?
[13:40:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:40:05] <robertmaxrees> you can do them all together.
[13:40:13] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function() {});
[13:40:51] <skinux> Would it be function(e) in order to have a handle do the specific submit that has been pressed?
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> or $(this) inside the handler, yes.
[13:41:06] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other event handlker.
[13:43:14] <skinux> Thanks
[13:43:55] <TheShawnReisner> Hello, I just arrived.  Is this irc active?
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:45:51] <TheShawnReisner> I'm using JQuery UI to make a div draggable in a horizontal image gallery I'm writing.
[13:46:43] <TheShawnReisner> If I remove the drag, start, and stop listeners I've added to the draggable (to rule out performance degradations on my behalf), I'm seeing near constant garbage collection as I'm dragging.
[13:46:56] <TheShawnReisner> It's bad enough that I'm experiencing pretty big framerate drops whenever there's a collection
[13:47:15] <TheShawnReisner> Is JQuery UI just a memory hog?
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it.
[13:47:34] <TheShawnReisner> Standby
[13:47:52] <TheShawnReisner> http://codepen.io/sreisner/pen/mPPoem
[13:47:54] <TheShawnReisner> There you go.
[13:48:00] <robertmaxrees> jQuery UI isn't necessarily the most efficient lib, so i wouldn't be surprised if you're seeing some issues, but i'd need to see it in action :)
[13:48:15] <TheShawnReisner> I used Chrome DevTools' Timeline feature to profile the memory.
[13:48:22] <robertmaxrees> so back way up.
[13:48:28] <TheShawnReisner> Hahaha okay
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to make it so the user can drag the entire gallery?
[13:49:09] <TheShawnReisner> Correct.
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui really isn't a good choice for something like that.
[13:49:35] <TheShawnReisner> What would you suggest?
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> that's actually kind of a heavy-handed approach.  part of your problem is that it's going to be running a ton of calculations and trigger some layout funk.
[13:49:52] <TheShawnReisner> Is it because it's such a physically large element?
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> size has very little to do with it.
[13:50:22] <decx> you already have all you need in your drag and stop function to just send a new css transform position after a drag event
[13:50:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:50:31] <TheShawnReisner> So the JQuery UI draggable isn't a good approach for making an element draggable?
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> forcus some something like this.
[13:50:39] <decx> ui is just in your way
[13:50:46] <decx> for this specific task
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> TheShawnReisner that's... not what i said.  jquery ui is great if you need to use a lot of its features.  in this case, you're using one.
[13:51:10] <TheShawnReisner> I see.
[13:51:23] <robertmaxrees> decx has a good suggestion.  otherwise, i'd look at using the native trag and drop api instead.
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> *drag
[13:51:50] <TheShawnReisner> decx: I don't think I understand what your suggestion is, sorry
[13:52:01] <TheShawnReisner> Oh, there's a native drag and drop api?
[13:52:05] <TheShawnReisner> I had no idea
[13:52:14] <robertmaxrees> in html5, yes.  but try figuring out decx's suggestion :)
[13:52:24] <TheShawnReisner> Okay.
[13:52:27] <robertmaxrees> a big part of your problem is you're using JS to do something CSS is much better suited for.
[13:52:30] <TheShawnReisner> decx: Could you elaborate for me please?
[13:52:40] <decx> you have a parent element where you want to catch events, you can for example use the width of a mousedown->mousemove->mouseup combo to move your container inside the viewport with translate(x,y)
[13:52:51] <TheShawnReisner> Oh, I see.
[13:53:05] <TheShawnReisner> That makes complete sense.
[13:53:36] <TheShawnReisner> So I'll listen for a mousedown, then when I hit an mousemove, perform a translateX to move it
[13:53:51] <TheShawnReisner> And then obviously stop when there's a mouseup
[13:54:27] <decx> if you do it on mousemove you have to debounce it to prevent too frequent updates of your moving containers cssText
[13:54:48] <TheShawnReisner> Understood.
[13:55:08] <decx> it's nice with translate on an absolutely positioned element because all the element that come after it dotn have to relayout/reflow whatever the right word is ^^
[13:55:40] <TheShawnReisner> So do you guys feel like this is a better solution than the HTML5 Drag and Drop API?
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> it's more of trying to help you understand that the issue isn't really jqui, but the way you're using it.
[13:56:13] <robertmaxrees> and that it's an easy performance trap.
[13:56:35] <TheShawnReisner> Okay, understood.
[13:56:51] <TheShawnReisner> Thanks for the help. :)
[13:58:00] <TheShawnReisner> Other than that, while I have you guys and you've looked at the UI, what do you think of the UI?
[13:58:07] <TheShawnReisner> Anything you'd add/change?
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> is this supposed to be like a carousel?
[13:58:56] <TheShawnReisner> Nope, I'm going to implement logic to stop it from running off screen
[13:59:10] <robertmaxrees> er.
[13:59:14] <TheShawnReisner> Just a simple swipe back and forth thing
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's basically a carousel.
[13:59:34] <TheShawnReisner> Doesn't a carousel repeat, or not necessarily?
[13:59:39] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[13:59:46] <TheShawnReisner> I see.  Then yes, this is a carousel.
[13:59:57] <TheShawnReisner> I'm going to use it for an artist portfolio page.
[14:00:14] <TheShawnReisner> You'll click on an image and a modal will pop up with the sweet deets.
[14:00:15] <robertmaxrees> i mean, other than the usability concerns and the semi-unintuitive interface, it's cool i suppose.
[14:00:39] <TheShawnReisner> Not... sure... if... passive aggressive
[14:00:49] <decx> it's a valid concern
[14:00:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm being 100% honest.
[14:01:04] <decx> people arent going to the right of these things
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> they won't "
[14:01:17] <robertmaxrees> *"get" that you can swipe.
[14:01:28] <TheShawnReisner> How about if I stuck arrows to the left and right?
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> still have a carousel.  aaaaannnd shouldiuseacarousel.com
[14:01:43] <TheShawnReisner> And then if they find out they can swipe as well it'll just be a bonus
[14:01:46] <decx> it works when you have like a few related products in a little line, or the video playlist  lines on youtube but for images you're better off with a nice grid
[14:01:55] <TheShawnReisner> Ah, so this is an issue with carousels as a pattern in general
[14:02:01] <decx> right
[14:03:03] <TheShawnReisner> Hm... She really wants this to fit on a single page.
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> grids are good.
[14:04:07] <decx> mix up your grid with bigger containers for that sweet fibonacci effect and you're good
[14:04:54] <phlix> I understand this is in angular. However the syntax and theory should be identical...
[14:04:57] <phlix> I have about 4 http requests that I need to make. But I need the data from the previous one in order to have the correct info for the next.. I have it formatted like so.. https://jsfiddle.net/d1jza6e8/ I can't quite seem how to take the data that I have here and format it properly so that I can do a promise chain to make that happen. I'm pretty new to this async, promise stuff
[14:05:11] <TheShawnReisner> I'll think about this, thanks for the suggestions guys
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> phlix you need to read up on promises.
[14:06:01] <robertmaxrees> because .success is not a promise method.
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to look into .then() and return calls out of those methods.
[14:06:33] <phlix> yes I have tried both ways. Its just the syntax I can't figure out
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> you realize angular uses a totally different syntax to most js, right? they use typescript iirc.
[14:07:09] <phlix> how can I chain multiple http requests with promises like I am doing.. Do they need to be in seperate functions still?
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to .then() against the prior call.
[14:07:56] <robertmaxrees> somePromise.then(function() { anotherPromise.then(function() {}); }); etc
[14:09:34] <phlix> robertmaxrees: But can I do that inside the single function? Should I pull the other item and not have it inside its own function?
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you mean by that question.
[14:10:00] <robertmaxrees> you can return the promise out of a function.
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> and then call .then() against that.
[14:10:40] <phlix> and it seems in order to get the response from $http I already have to use $http({}).then(function(response) { and do response work here }
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> sure (i have no idea how angular works)
[14:11:06] <robertmaxrees> but that's the idea.
[14:11:11] <phlix> robertmaxrees: I think its mostly syntax here thats fowling me up.. Could you show a quick example.
[14:11:19] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:11:27] <robertmaxrees> i JUST explained that angular uses typescript.
[14:11:30] <robertmaxrees> soooo.
[14:12:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd really encourage you to hit up the angular channel for this :)
[14:12:10] <phlix> well can you show ajax jquery example. I could easily figure it out if I could see how I can chain the promises
[14:12:19] <phlix> I have tried. People only idle there. I think they all moved to slack or something
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> then join slack? lol that doesn't change the topic of this channel :)
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-chaining
[14:15:57] <phlix> I have seen a bunch of examples like this that you have shown if I can use the ajax call in a single line. but I have a bunch of other data to send to it. Not sure how if I have to use $http({ headers, stuff here}).then(function(response)) { do stuff with response }).then .... Where to do new $http request if were still chaining from the previous?
[14:16:03] <phlix> not sure if that makes any sense.
[14:16:21] <robertmaxrees> phlix in the handler registered via .then()
[15:04:34] <noregret> i have a list of string numbers, what is the fastest way to add them all and get a sum? is there something better than looping it
[15:11:10] <decx> reduce

[23:38:55] <harmonia> hello all,
[23:39:13] <harmonia> I am trying to use pure javascript to do the same thing as .offset
[23:39:35] <harmonia> .offset({top:100, left: 300});
[23:40:12] <harmonia> i went to the youmightnotneedjquery.com site but im not sure they cover this
[23:41:07] <rcyr> Look at how jQuery does it..?
[23:41:15] <harmonia> I HAVE
[23:41:21] <harmonia> the function returns an object
[23:41:27] <harmonia> im confused how jquery actually repositions
[23:41:40] <rcyr> You cannot reposition using offset AFAIK
[23:41:57] <rcyr> It's a "query" method
[23:42:04] <rcyr> Hmm
[23:42:07] <rcyr> Perhaps not.
[23:42:24] <harmonia> offset is a jquery method thats why i need to replace it with pure js
[23:42:29] <harmonia> my project cannot use jquery
[23:42:55] <harmonia> the offset function returns an json object
[23:43:00] <harmonia> how does the position change then?
[23:43:19] <rcyr> Yeah, it changes the position... I did not know that.
[23:44:02] <harmonia> yeah...
[23:44:09] <harmonia> im stumped
[23:44:14] <rcyr> So, from what I can see from the doc, it would calculate the current position... then add position: relative; (if static) then calculate the new offset.
[23:45:05] <rcyr> So, if the element is currently at 50 50.... and you want it at 10 10... then it would add position: relative and left: -40px; top: -40px; on it
[23:45:32] <harmonia> so in pure js i would have to use element.style.top
[23:45:59] <rcyr> Yes.
[23:46:07] <harmonia> ok
[23:46:09] <harmonia> ill try it
[23:46:11] <rcyr> The difficult part is to calculate the current position
[23:50:56] <harmonia> jquery uses getBoundingClientRect()
[23:52:29] <harmonia> it works!
[23:53:32] <Insentience> someone recommend a webdevelopment framework or something that i can get started with please
[23:53:40] <Insentience> there are so many choices its like shopping for shampoo
[23:53:48] <Insentience> all so colourful it just hurts the head
[23:54:37] <rcyr> harmonia: Nice! Back in the days, you had to iterate on the parents... adding the .offsetLeft/Top :(
[23:54:46] <rcyr> harmonia: Hurry for getBoundingClientRect
[23:54:51] <rcyr> *Hurray even
