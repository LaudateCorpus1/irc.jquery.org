[08:43:25] <V7> Hey all
[08:43:59] <V7> Why wouldn't $('#player_list').trigger("sorton", [ [ [6,0] ] ]) work from extension? No reaction, but from conolse it works?
[08:44:21] <V7> Extension for UserScripts
[08:44:47] <V7> Eveything else works
[13:04:00] <Starship809> Hi there, i am trying to create a custom function and call it on an input field. inside the function i want to console.log the value of the calling input field: https://pastebin.com/97Wp1GTW
[13:04:12] <Starship809> unfortunately, it does not work. it always returns undefined
[13:53:21] <shoky_> Starship809: you want $(this).val()   or this.value
[13:54:11] <shoky_> Starship809: oh sorry actually this.val() should be ok
[13:54:25] <shoky_> make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[13:55:46] <shoky_> Starship809: might need to quote the input name
[15:14:27] <Cork> - shouldn't need quotes (though it is normally easier to read if one does)
[15:14:48] <Cork> test console.log(this.length)
[15:15:08] <Cork> might be the element isn't found so you don't have any element to work with
[15:15:34] <Cork> this is why plugins is expected to do this.each(function() {}) and not work with the this object directly
[19:24:24] <snackoverflow> can someone help me with some code?
