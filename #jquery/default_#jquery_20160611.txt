[05:10:17] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I want to update the "Seen" / "Unseen" message in my loop, my problem is how can I select each of the values, I've copied the structure on how one of the loops look like and here's my jQuery code: https://pastee.org/5ww87
[05:10:53] <Pazician> Currently it's selecting one of the values and giving the one value from the single one to all of them
[05:14:30] <ltorvalds024> I have downloaded the jquery-ui.zip and it contains many files. If I intend to use it in my project how many files do I have to include?
[05:21:12] <ecclesiastes> quit
[05:21:15] <ecclesiastes> ...
[05:26:41] <ltorvalds024> ?
[07:05:22] <Duikb00t> o/
[07:05:43] <Duikb00t> I have a question: When I have some checkboxes, and I check one, I would like to load 2 input fields 'below' the checkbox.
[07:06:04] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to do this? Generate them in jquery ? Or show hide them with jquery?
[07:37:52] <shoky_> doesn't matter much
[08:01:03] <repxl> hello, guys i'm doing a websocket client and i don't want to lose the connection i want to be permanently 24h connected to the websocket server how can i approach this ? i read somewhere there are ping and pong messages but how does it works ? how can i use it i need just send every 20 seconds a ping message ? or do i wait from the server for a pong message and i response with a ping message ehhh i rly don't get it
[09:26:11] <Duikb00t> o/
[09:26:39] <Duikb00t> I made this so far: https://jsfiddle.net/m3RHG/209/
[09:26:55] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to just 'show'/'hide' the element where you select the checkbox?
[09:27:00] <Duikb00t> Which appears when you select it...
[09:27:14] <Duikb00t> I tried toggle() but that removes everyting :P ( probably it has some default as hidden? )
[09:33:27] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/m3RHG/210/ like this?
[09:33:37] <Duikb00t> Almost there
[09:33:52] <Duikb00t> oooh that's event better
[09:33:55] <Duikb00t> I was doing this:
[09:34:01] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/m3RHG/211/
[09:34:15] <Duikb00t> But your setup is much cleaner
[09:34:59] <Duikb00t> I have to 'attach' some new html elements to the checkbox once it's clicked
[09:38:53] <Duikb00t> Uhkis: https://jsfiddle.net/m3RHG/212/ :)
[09:40:10] <Duikb00t> The thing is now.. all the content that appears whenclicked should be attached to all checkboxes ( 25 in total )
[09:40:17] <Duikb00t> what's the cleanest way of doing that ?
[09:40:53] <Uhkis> backend should generate that html
[09:41:20] <Duikb00t> How do you mean? :-)
[10:18:50] <Parham> Hi all. I am trying to include the jQuery plugin from its CDN, but I'm getting an error like this: "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js" is not eligible for integrity checks since it's neither CORS-enabled nor same-origin.
[10:18:53] <Parham> How can I fix it?
[10:20:28] <dgaf> Parham why dont you download jquery js ?
[10:20:42] <Uhkis> Parham: try //code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js
[10:20:49] <dgaf> its better, incase servers go down
[10:20:53] <Parham> dgaf: I'm a beginner to jQuery. I read somewhere that using the CDN is better?
[10:21:33] <Ales> its not better, their site can go down, then what code will you rely on
[10:22:05] <Parham> Uhkis: It's the same error. It's just that it's using http instead of https.
[10:22:32] <Uhkis> biggest reason not to use cdn is security btw
[10:22:44] <Parham> Ales: Thanks. I'll just download it then.
[10:23:00] <Ales> lol why Uhkis?
[10:23:04] <Parham> Uhkis: I thought the sha1 prevents that?
[10:25:02] <Uhkis> Parham: huh?
[10:26:01] <Parham> Uhkis: The integrity attribute?
[10:27:40] <Uhkis> Parham: you mean this? http://caniuse.com/#search=integrity
[10:28:47] <Parham> Yes.
[10:29:11] <Uhkis> as you can see, its not fully implemented
[10:31:54] <Parham> Uhkis: Right. Thanks.
[11:05:52] <maxpen> the reds don't work, all negative values are just with red class not red1 or red2
[11:07:27] <maxpen> greens don't work either, its all green
[11:08:03] <maxpen> guys I need some help with this https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/on6mpqcn/
[11:14:08] <harroooonnharry> how do i get the second link in a navigation to add a css class?
[11:15:39] <maxpen> can anyone help me folks?
[11:20:25] <Uhkis> maxpen: missing a lot of code and markup
[11:20:29] <Uhkis> harroooonnharry: depends on the markup
[11:22:10] <YottaByte> hi, I'm using $.get to call a public api, and I get a 404 ajax error if the data is not found, how can I handle this? my ajax call is in the form $.get(url, function(res) { });
[11:24:41] <Uhkis> YottaByte: add .fail() to it
[11:25:44] <Uhkis> YottaByte: https://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/
[11:38:08] <maxpen> well Uhkis try now: https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/on6mpqcn/2/
[11:38:42] <maxpen> it almost works now lol
[11:38:50] <maxpen> only the green classes don't get added
[11:38:57] <maxpen> you can see it in action on cointrust.pw
[11:56:25] <Uhkis> maxpen: seems to work fine: https://jsfiddle.net/on6mpqcn/4/
[11:58:48] <maxpen> oh yea I forgot it was set on 8, should have picked 9
[11:58:50] <maxpen> lool
[12:02:12] <Uhkis> :)
[12:09:06] <VectorX> in this example https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/6/ if you type something in the input and move mouse out it changes the text, but you cant do it again, why is that? also how can i add a ::before style to the .change class
[12:12:26] <maxpen> Uhkis still got an issue though
[12:12:57] <maxpen> what if the use has a rep of -50 , I set the max to 50 and that works but going in minus like -50 I can't giet it to work
[12:14:28] <maxpen> I don't know how javascript threats numbers in -  with > or <
[12:15:19] <Uhkis> <-49 should work fine
[12:15:36] <Uhkis> maxpen: make sure to parseInt() it though, -49 might turn to a string
[12:18:40] <maxpen> parseInt? haven't used that much Uhkis
[12:19:16] <Uhkis> maxpen: just parseInt($this.text());
[12:21:01] <Uhkis> VectorX: it's because your original element gets replaced and the change handler is lost
[12:21:58] <Uhkis> VectorX: https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/7/
[12:43:22] <VectorX> Uhkis great, how about adding the ::before to the new element ?
[12:44:02] <VectorX> im basically trying to keep the word "world"(can be anything) as an anchor but make it appear that is changed
[12:44:45] <VectorX> so when you type, it should hide "world" and show what was typed with the ability to keep doing it, perhaps there is a better way than what i am doing
[12:46:46] <Uhkis> VectorX: can the markup be modified?
[12:47:40] <VectorX> Uhkis its straight text on a page, and the the input will probably have a data tag with the word/phrase that can be changed, but otherwise no
[12:47:54] <VectorX> sort of like a find and replace
[12:50:50] <Uhkis> VectorX: so you wanna wrap the "world" with inputs value?
[12:54:32] <VectorX> Uhkis not wrap replace, but any consequential inputs should replace the same thing, ie, "the quick brown fox" if fox was the word to change, if they type dog then cat then mouse, in the input it should change each time, so what i thought was to add a wrapper around the word the first time, then add the new word as a ::before and hide the contents of the wrapper, i left "world" in there as debug,
[12:54:32] <VectorX> but it probably should be in there hidden for subsequence change
[12:58:37] <Uhkis> VectorX: is the initial word known?
[12:58:54] <VectorX> yeah, id probably set it as a data attrib in the input
[13:00:48] <VectorX> its for a wordpress plugin, where the input will be a shortcode, so a user would add the shortcode with the word/phrase to change as a parameter and the input will show up on the post
[13:03:31] <Uhkis> VectorX: https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/8/ ?
[13:05:38] <VectorX> wow thats amazing
[13:10:13] <VectorX> Uhkis if i have multiple input boxes for different words/phrases any advice on making it generic, i was thinking using the id or class of the data item in the input but just incase it has funky characters
[14:17:06] <ales> guys have beer on me !! http://i.imgur.com/i0UOncm.png

[16:44:19] <pandaboss> hey, could someone tell why this website background load so slow?

[17:39:30] <_TWG_> I have an array that has multiple items in it.  Inside each item there are 4 fields.  How can I call a specific field inside each item?
[18:10:31] <notchris_> How do I reference an object, inside an array, inside an object?
[18:10:49] <notchris_> In example, the objects within “tracks”
[18:10:50] <notchris_> https://i.imgur.com/57Dv6Dc.png
[18:11:17] <systemfault> notchris_ foo['tracks'][0]['title']
[18:11:46] <systemfault> Could also be written as: foo.tracks[0].title
[18:12:10] <notchris_> systemfault: hmm
[18:12:16] <notchris_> systemfault: https://i.imgur.com/iO3at1O.png
[18:12:33] <notchris_> tracks is an array of objects
[18:12:50] <systemfault> Yup.
[18:12:54] <systemfault> And?
[18:13:18] <notchris_> Ah it works!
[18:13:23] <notchris_> Thank you systemfault
[18:13:23] <notchris_> :)
[18:13:40] <notchris_> instead of [0], how do I say all?
