[03:12:00] <paule32> hello
[03:12:16] <paule32> i have problem with dynamic loading:  http://dpaste.com/1J2P2R2
[03:13:30] <paule32> the problem is, that the "ui-window"  is not display, when i load data with $.get (after $(document).ready
[03:13:57] <paule32> is that a bug? or do i use the $.get function wrong?
[10:11:48] <GrandPa-G> I have two table displayed which I want to sync the row's position. Table A uses plugin sortable with drag and drop. When a row in table A is moved, I want a similar row in table B to also be moved to the same location. Any suggestions how to accomplish this?
