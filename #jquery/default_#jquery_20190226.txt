[00:00:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[00:01:25] <Cypris> let me ask it like this.. what would be the way to grab .data() if the element is in the process of being removed. From what i see, $.fn.remove doesn't even trigger an event in jQuery..
[00:01:38] <robertmaxrees> correct
[00:01:50] <robertmaxrees> there isn't really a way to do it while it's being removed.
[00:01:57] <robertmaxrees> so grab the data, then remove it.
[00:05:37] <Cypris> i was hoping for something like how window.onbeforeunload triggers before window.onunload.. but i'm sure i'll figure out something
[00:05:53] <robertmaxrees> ... so why can't you just grab the data before you remove the element?
[00:06:49] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[03:41:54] <CuirPork> ugg. Can someone help me with something super easy: https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/gqGLZP?editors=1111
[03:42:23] <CuirPork> I must have a typo or something. You should be able to click the body and the panel should remove the active class and slide down. It just sits there.
[03:43:51] <CuirPork> nvm. I swear. All I have to do is ask and I find the error. I have spent an hour on this and just forgot to return
[03:44:09] <Cork> CuirPork: why don't you juse use toggleClass('active', $("#footer-panel.active").length < 1); instead of the if case and functions?
[03:53:15] <CuirPork> I'm actually going to use a hidden radio button like I did with the tabs, this was just to see it work.
[09:46:13] <rnmhdn> I have a base.html template which is extended in every other template.
[09:48:53] <rnmhdn> and I have a template cart-detail.html that is actually a sidebar
[09:49:05] <rnmhdn> and doesn't extend base.html
[09:49:16] <rnmhdn> and I have a template store.html
[09:49:23] <rnmhdn> that extends base and is my store.
[09:49:35] <rnmhdn> I want to include the cart sidebar in the store.
[09:49:38] <rnmhdn> is tha tpossible?
[09:50:10] <rnmhdn> I would need to pass some context to both of store and cart-detail
[09:59:45] <pavonia> That description is a bit vague, but you might want to look at .load()
[10:23:34] <jomofcw_> Hello !
[10:24:03] <hollusion> ive written a jquery plugin and wonder how to load another plugin within it
[10:24:05] <jomofcw_> Can you confirm me that is normal : when I trigger a click on a A[href] element, it doesn't browse to the href of the A link, normal ?
[10:24:32] <hollusion> only possible via getScript() which is async?
[10:25:24] <hollusion> jomofcw_, check if the click event has function (ev) { ev.preventDefault(); ... }
[10:27:47] <jomofcw_> hollusion hello. Found an answer on stackoverflow : I need to use the click event of the DOm element, not the click handler of jQuery.
[10:29:03] <Cork> jqlog: use the clich event??
[10:29:14] <Cork> jqlog: you mean you need to trigger an event on the element?
[10:29:26] <jomofcw_> *click
[10:29:27] <Cork> uh... wrong nick..
[10:29:35] <jomofcw_> Cork ^^
[10:29:40] <Cork> jomofcw_: what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:29:46] <jomofcw_> I mean : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6068266/jquery-how-to-trigger-anchor-links-click-event
[10:29:52] <jomofcw_> but in fact, still not browsing :/.
[10:30:20] <taplar> you can trigger click on the jQuery object or the Element.  triggering on the element bypasses jQuery bound click event handlers
[10:30:35] <Cork> jomofcw_: browsers doesn't trigger the default action
[10:30:41] <Cork> (for links)
[10:30:45] <Cork> use window.location
[10:31:16] <jomofcw_> Cork I made a snippet that enable me to "generalize" a click on an element which is the ancestor of a A[href] element. When clicking on the target element, it mimic a click on the child A element.
[10:31:51] <jomofcw_> Yea th'ats what I'm doing curently, but, it's a problem when I add another click handler on the targeted A element :/...
[10:31:53] <Cork> so you just want to trigger a bubbling event?
[10:32:50] <jomofcw_> I want to be able to click in a LI element that contain a text and a link, and when I click on the text, it trigger the click on the A.
[10:33:12] <thykka> err.. why is the text not part of the link?
[10:33:16] <Cork> ya
[10:33:19] <Cork> cause you can't do that
[10:33:32] <Cork> make the a tag wrapp more content
[10:33:34] <taplar> you can put the text in a label
[10:34:22] <thykka> besides, if you were to implement it like that, you'd annoy the fuck out of people who want to, say, open the link inÂ a new tab, etc
[10:34:31] <thykka> or even just copy the link address
[10:34:36] <jomofcw_> Cork that was just a simple example... sometime i've got block element that I can't wrap in the A :/.
[10:34:39] <thykka> or look at it, before opening it
[10:34:58] <Cork> jomofcw_: that is html4, that limitation doens't exist in the live html standard
[10:35:06] <Cork> you can wrap a table if you like...
[10:35:08] <jomofcw_> thykka taplar hello. See the precision above ^
[10:35:22] <jomofcw_> Cork I can wrap anything I want in a ?
[10:35:27] <jomofcw_> *in A
[10:35:30] <Cork> except another a
[10:35:34] <thykka> not anything you want
[10:35:40] <thykka> but a block-level element is fine
[10:35:47] <jomofcw_> OK, thanks =).
[10:35:51] <thykka> you don't want to put, say, an input inside an a
[10:36:32] <thykka> or any other natively interactive element
[10:37:27] <jomofcw_> thykka nop ^^ thanks god :D.
[10:38:42] <Cork> lol ya, i forgot those
[10:38:55] <Cork> most replaced elements will not work, but they are valid though
[10:41:12] <jomofcw_> OK :) nice ^^. Thanks.
[10:54:47] <Wilfredor> hi guys
[10:55:47] <Wilfredor> how I could get the size of the a array of inputs with name name="input[0]" name="input[1]" and name="input[2]"
[10:55:57] <Wilfredor> how should be the jquery selector?
[11:00:46] <pavonia> Should that find all inputs of that pattern?
[11:02:18] <taplar> $('input[name^="input["]') should grab the inputs that start with that substring
[11:02:46] <taplar> otherwise, stick a common class on them and simplify your life, :)
[11:28:28] <Wilfredor> taplar thanks i will think about it
[11:44:02] <diverdude> hi, i see many good writings about jest as a unit testing env. for javascript/jquery. Can anybody confirm this or recommend sth. better?
[11:45:20] <robertmaxrees> jest is good.
[11:45:26] <robertmaxrees> use jest.
[11:47:57] <taplar> i liked jasmine when i used it
[11:52:00] <robertmaxrees> we used to use jasmine.  jest has fantastic ergonomics imo.
[12:54:31] <taplar> trying to confuse me with big words...
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:59:31] <laravewlnewb> I have a simple array products = ["1","2","3"]; .. I am looping thru a list of products and trying to use $.inArray(this.id, products) but it always returns -1 even if this.id is in the product is in the array
[12:59:47] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[13:02:53] <laravewlnewb> https://jsfiddle.net/5h42jmpg/
[13:04:00] <robertmaxrees> what is "this" in this case?
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> and some markup would be nice :)
[13:04:40] <laravewlnewb> its an id.. if I type if (this.id == "1") { alert('match
[13:04:45] <laravewlnewb> it will work
[13:04:55] <laravewlnewb> not sure what is wrong with $.inArray
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k982e5b1/1/ ?
[13:05:51] <robertmaxrees> so this works>
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> it's super hard to know what the issue could be without a little more context heh
[13:07:38] <robertmaxrees> also: is 'this' wha you think it is?
[13:07:48] <robertmaxrees> in that $.each ?
[13:07:59] <laravewlnewb> that each just loops across 6 products
[13:08:02] <laravewlnewb> 1 2 3 4 5 6
[13:08:08] <laravewlnewb> enabled products has only product 1 2 and 3 enabled
[13:08:33] <laravewlnewb> so i am trying to use $.inArray inside the loop to see if the product is enabled before drawing it
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out the fiddle a bit more so I can see what you're doing it?
[13:08:38] <robertmaxrees> *what you're doing
[13:08:40] <laravewlnewb> if not enabled then i can ignore it
[13:09:16] <laravewlnewb> not sure what other part of the code is relevant.. is just a simple array with 3 numerical elements and the $.each loop
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> function(data) { isn't valid, for instance.
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not named.
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> how does this function get called?
[13:09:40] <laravewlnewb> then that would be the problem
[13:09:43] <robertmaxrees> what is product_id ?
[13:09:50] <laravewlnewb> function( data ) { $.each(data, function() {
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> right - how is this function called?
[13:10:22] <laravewlnewb> product_id is the name of the select element form input
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> so how is this whole function called?  event handler?
[13:11:37] <laravewlnewb> it's in the code it's not a named function it's an ajax request using $.post()
[13:11:38] <robertmaxrees> i think your issue is 'this' isn't what you think it is.
[13:12:12] <laravewlnewb> this.id returns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .. if i type if (this.id == "4") alert('help') it will trigger just once
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> can you should me what 'data' looks like?
[13:13:34] <laravewlnewb> if i console.log(this.id); it will return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
[13:13:48] <laravewlnewb> thats all the data there is
[13:13:50] <robertmaxrees> can console.log(data) before the loop?
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> the data itself seems ot have an id and a name
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> *to
[13:14:24] <laravewlnewb> it does
[13:14:34] <robertmaxrees> so can you should me what 'data' looks like?
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> (it's very relevant, i promise)
[13:15:35] <laravewlnewb> trying to update the fiddle
[13:15:51] <robertmaxrees> make sure you JSON.stringify(data);
[13:16:00] <robertmaxrees> and copy/paste that.
[13:16:04] <laravewlnewb> https://pastebin.com/07RgjbMq
[13:16:08] <laravewlnewb> this is what it looks like
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue.
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> $.inArray is doing ===, not ==
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> so '1' == 1 is true, but '1' === 1 is false.
[13:17:09] <laravewlnewb> so i should not be using $.inArray for this operation?
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix your data.
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> enabledProducts should be an array of numbers.
[13:17:34] <laravewlnewb> the data or the enabledProducts array ?
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> right now it's an array of strings, but your data is using numbers.  the two need to match.
[13:18:43] <laravewlnewb> so I need to add numbered indexes to this array ? ["1", "2", "3"]
[13:18:58] <laravewlnewb> i see.. thanks
[13:19:05] <robertmaxrees> "numbered indexes"???
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> the values themselves need to be numbers.
[13:19:52] <robertmaxrees> arrays already operate using numerical indices :)
[13:19:52] <laravewlnewb> var enabledProducts = ["1", "2", "3"];
[13:19:59] <laravewlnewb> so using single quotes instead of double quotes you mean?
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:20:07] <robertmaxrees> var enabledProducts = [1, 2, 3];
[13:20:10] <robertmaxrees> with no quotes at all.
[13:20:13] <robertmaxrees> the values need to be numbers
[13:20:16] <robertmaxrees> not strings.
[13:20:17] <laravewlnewb> thank you!
[13:21:03] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:21:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:34:48] <laravewlnewb> worked like a charm... i'll pay more attention
[13:34:51] <laravewlnewb> next time

[17:57:04] <jak2020> hi all, escuse me if is a basic question: i receive a json with four variables: 1) json.wsec='SC,SB,SD' ; and 2) json.secador_SC='Jhon Smith with...' json.secador_SB='Peter Moulde with...' json.secador_SD='AAron Rios with...'
[17:57:44] <jak2020> my question is: i do an split on variable json.wsec, but iin my jquery code how to get the value of other json variables.... ?
[17:58:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[18:03:14] <taplar> oh
[18:03:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:03:29] <taplar> json['secador'+ token[n]]
[18:03:32] <taplar> err
[18:03:36] <taplar> json['secador_'+ token[n]]
[18:03:53] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:04:05] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[18:04:06] <robertmaxrees> OH.
[18:04:08] <robertmaxrees> gross.
[18:04:11] <taplar> ya
[18:04:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2020 fix that data structure.
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> makes no sense.
[18:05:37] <jak2020> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/2n8qef13/
[18:05:50] <jak2020> something like that how to .... refer to variables
[18:05:51] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:05:53] <jak2020> taplar, thanks testing...
[18:06:01] <taplar> that's majorly different than what you said
[18:06:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ lmao
[18:06:05] <taplar> that's not a single json
[18:06:21] <jak2020> taplaar, is a json, but is returned from my server
[18:06:22] <robertmaxrees> in fact, nothing youâve shared so far is json.
[18:06:27] <jak2020> with your sample typed here i can try
[18:06:38] <robertmaxrees> also: donât use for loops.
[18:06:46] <jak2020> then?
[18:06:50] <robertmaxrees> forEach
[18:06:54] <robertmaxrees> or map
[18:06:55] <taplar> var json = { wsec: '', secador_SC: '', ... } would be a json
[18:06:58] <robertmaxrees> or whatevcer youa ctually want.
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> *whatever you actually want.
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> taplar nope :)
[18:07:27] <taplar> in the file it would be json, :P
[18:07:27] <robertmaxrees> var json = â{ âwsecâ: ââ, âsecador_SCâ: '', ... }
[18:07:33] <taplar> oh, sure
[18:07:40] <robertmaxrees> json requires double quotes, etc ;)
[18:07:50] <robertmaxrees> (just making sure jak2020 is aware)
[18:07:55] <taplar> np
[18:08:00] <jak2020> ok redefine the fiddle
[18:09:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:09:28] <jak2020> creating a new fiddle... :)
[18:09:31] <robertmaxrees> k

[22:14:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:14:11] <jak2000> oo robertmaxrees are you there?
[22:14:14] <jak2000> i am ok right?
[22:14:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:29:09] <robertmaxrees> welp
[22:29:54] <jak2000> i am impressed: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/0pb7h1dv/1/
[22:30:27] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't be.
[22:30:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad way to store data.
[22:31:33] <jak2000> wich recommend me?
[22:31:56] <robertmaxrees> what does "wsec" mean?
[22:32:06] <jak2000> secador :)
[22:32:09] <jak2000> any variable name
[22:32:12] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:32:16] <robertmaxrees> what is "secador"?
[22:32:38] <robertmaxrees> that wsec string is half the problem.
[22:33:06] <jak2000> a dryer
[22:33:10] <jak2000> ok
[22:33:14] <jak2000> variable names..
[22:33:18] <jak2000> the other half?
[22:33:19] <robertmaxrees> and what does "SC" "SB" SD"
[22:33:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[22:33:33] <robertmaxrees> "variable names" doesn't make sense.
[22:33:37] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[22:33:38] <jak2000> ahh is a identifier, its not mine.... is of the Company
[22:33:54] <robertmaxrees> you need to have them expose a not terrible api.
[22:34:33] <jak2000> :)
[22:34:49] <robertmaxrees> yg
[22:34:52] <robertmaxrees> *uh
[22:35:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not something to feel good about.
[22:35:46] <robertmaxrees> without more context, if i were reviewing this code, i'd reject it.
[22:36:37] <jak2000> if is a exam
[22:36:45] <robertmaxrees> "a exam"?
[22:36:49] <jak2000> i get 80%? not 100% but 80% ?
[22:36:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see more context.
[22:37:29] * jak2000 learning how to add a div to another div...
[22:37:31] <robertmaxrees> contrived examples are one thing, bad examples are another.
[22:37:41] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with this fiddle?
[22:38:00] <jak2000> next step is add divs  ... but i am working
[22:38:30] <robertmaxrees> uh, ok?
