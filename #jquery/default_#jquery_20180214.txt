[04:20:12] <jQueryGuest> hi there! have a quite annoying problem using jquery (first time) in a vss2017 project. I referred to js by using <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js" type="text/javascript"></script> as well as by using the nuget package but still get the ultimate '$ is undefined' error :-|
[04:21:19] <jQueryGuest> guess I have some basic misunderstanding, can anyone give some input on this?
[04:21:21] <Cork> jQueryGuest: have you added them in the right order?
[04:21:32] <Cork> cause that is the only two requirements
[04:22:04] <Cork> (also make sure to check the generated html, not the server code)
[08:31:12] <tocka> what would be the best way to check if all select boxes are have a selected option and its value is not empty?
[08:31:20] <tocka> should I do a each()?
[08:32:32] <Cork> $('select').not($('option:selected').closest('select'))
[08:32:52] <Cork> and if you have a default option that is empty
[08:33:06] <Cork> $('select').not($('option:selected').not('[value=""]').closest('select'))
[08:33:30] <tocka> :o
[08:33:33] <tocka> looks fancy :D
[08:33:36] <tocka> lets try this out :o
[08:33:56] * Cork makes sure :selected exists...
[08:34:15] <Cork> yup
[08:34:49] <tocka> it works
[08:34:55] <tocka> magic!
[08:34:59] <tocka> thanks! :)
[08:35:02] <Cork> do you understand what it does?
[08:40:07] <caution> how do i remove css pseudo elements (e.g. before and after) element for a element?
[08:40:31] <Cork> caution: remove the class from the element that creates them
[08:40:41] <Cork> or add a class that sets it to display: none;
[08:40:56] <Cork> javascript can't access psudo elements directly
[08:42:10] <tocka> Cork yes :)
[08:42:28] <tocka> Thanks! :)
[08:42:33] <Cork> np
[08:43:54] <Woet> :)
[08:44:16] <caution> Cork: this works fine on jsfiddle but on my actual html, when i change an option i see prevous option as well as the new option (should only show the new option as you see here) https://jsfiddle.net/axe4jxr3/9/
[08:44:48] <Cork> caution: is it with the same css?
[08:45:39] <Cork> cause the specificy of the selectors define which wins, not primarily the order
[08:46:29] <caution> yes
[08:46:50] <caution> what does that mean?
[08:47:12] <Cork> caution: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
[08:48:02] <caution_> Cork: how do i fix it?
[08:48:29] <Cork> simplest is to check the dom elements with the dom inspector in the browser and make sure the correct rule apply
[08:48:47] <Cork> (the ones overriden are stroke through)
[08:53:03] <undefined_bob> Cork: do you have an iPhone?
[08:53:15] <Cork> uh, why do you ask?
[08:53:43] <undefined_bob> because there is something I dont understand and which I cant track
[08:54:08] <undefined_bob> its not really jquery but you are the most skilled person I know
[08:54:25] <Cork> you can't really debug on an iphone
[08:54:39] <Cork> you can't reproduce in a browser with a small screen?
[08:54:51] <undefined_bob> sadly no
[08:55:06] <undefined_bob> its working on a chrome with device mode
[08:55:11] <undefined_bob> but not on real iphone
[08:55:16] <Cork> what happens?
[08:55:43] <undefined_bob> a simple border-bottom: 1px solid black; dont show
[08:55:54] <Cork> on what?
[08:56:00] <undefined_bob> but only on menu elements which have a sub-menu
[08:56:31] <Cork> sounds like a possible rendering bug, webkit loves to have those
[08:57:06] <undefined_bob> if you want you can either check on my testpage http://undefined.bplaced.net or on a pen: https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/WMjWba
[08:57:06] <Cork> fiddling with filter (forcing rendering layers) often helps
[08:57:16] <Cork> but ya, most likely a better question for #css
[08:57:28] <undefined_bob> I worte several @media which target the iphone
[08:57:35] <undefined_bob> but nothing works
[08:57:46] <Cork> most likely cause you haven't targeted the cause
[08:57:52] <undefined_bob> yes, very true but the guys on #css had no idea
[08:58:00] <Cork> heh
[08:58:02] <Cork> ouch
[08:58:23] <undefined_bob> I asked there for three days
[08:58:48] <undefined_bob> I wouldnt bother you if I havent tried everything else
[09:00:07] <undefined_bob> it works on every other device, iPad is fine, android, mac, all desktop browsers, just not on the iphone
[09:00:12] <caution_> Cork: see what i mean? https://jsfiddle.net/axe4jxr3/12/
[09:03:15] <caution_> Cork: select an option, and you'll see https://jsfiddle.net/axe4jxr3/15/
[09:03:49] <Cork> caution_: trying to figure out why you expect any of them to hide
[09:04:24] <Cork> you don't have any overflow:hidden, and all the radio elements have different names so they belong to different groups (aka, they don't uncheck)
[09:04:43] <Cork> so not sure what you expect to happen
[09:05:01] <caution_> Cork: this one works, https://jsfiddle.net/axe4jxr3/9/
[09:05:19] <caution_> which does that one work and other does not?
[09:05:24] <Cork> caution_: ya, cause there you have one group with different values
[09:05:35] <Cork> not 3 groups
[09:05:37] <caution_> ah!
[09:05:49] <caution_> how do i fix it?
[09:05:55] <Cork> give them the same name?
[09:06:04] <caution_> can i see a jsfiddle?
[09:06:08] <Cork> ...
[09:06:15] <Cork> just change the name attribute...
[09:06:16] <caution_> all must have same name?
[09:06:24] <Cork> else they belong to different groups
[09:07:21] <Cork> undefined_bob: what broder is it you have problem with?
[09:07:31] <Cork> its over 400 lines of css...
[09:08:16] <undefined_bob> its the border for .site-nav a  line 78
[09:09:13] <Cork> you mean border-top: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.5); ?
[09:09:22] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:09:36] <Cork> you said border-bottom before...
[09:09:50] <undefined_bob> I tried both
[09:10:12] <undefined_bob> I set a top there and at the iphone specific code the bottom
[09:10:29] <undefined_bob> the iphone code is the @media below that class
[09:10:51] <caution_> sorted
[09:10:54] <undefined_bob> do you look at the pen or at the test page?
[09:12:14] <undefined_bob> here is also an image which show the borders https://imgur.com/a/CKoWV
[09:13:05] <Cork> that looks like rounding errors with at a scale though
[09:13:19] <Cork> not specified borders
[09:13:46] <Cork> em is prob the cause of your problems
[09:13:47] <undefined_bob> and on a real iphone the borders at the elements with the arrow are not shown at all
[09:14:04] <Cork> as it can (and often will) result in sub pixels
[09:14:28] <Cork> and when that then get rounded to px you get jittering
[09:14:46] <undefined_bob> hm that would make sense
[09:15:08] <undefined_bob> but why only on iphone? because of their "special" displays?
[09:15:21] <Cork> no, cause it runs at a different resolution
[09:15:25] <Cork> em scales with font size
[09:15:32] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:15:36] <Cork> 1em isn't always the same
[09:15:54] <Cork> so how many pixels it becomes depends on the device
[09:16:04] <undefined_bob> you mean because the resolution is very high?
[09:16:20] <Cork> no, it isn't about high or low
[09:16:28] <Cork> it is about decimal values
[09:16:48] <undefined_bob> I understand but on all other mobiles, it works fine
[09:16:54] <Cork> if 1em becomes 11.6423px it gets rounded to 12px
[09:17:06] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:17:07] <Cork> and if it by the shifting of this the next becomes 11px
[09:17:34] <Cork> it is the nature of em elements scaling
[09:17:46] <Cork> if you expect pixel position and use em you will have a hard time
[09:18:15] <undefined_bob> mhm I see
[09:18:39] <Cork> overcontraining the elements might also be a cause (not sure if it is in this case)
[09:19:02] <undefined_bob> so better use em for that border too? because I think rewriting the whole menu in none em would be a big task
[09:19:29] <Cork> you could try, but it will most likely just make the problem worse
[09:20:05] <undefined_bob> or svg image for border?
[09:20:16] <undefined_bob> or just setting border:none; for iphone :D
[09:20:22] <Cork> the problem isn't with the elements so no won't make a difference
[09:20:37] <Cork> the problem is that you can't render 0.6px
[09:20:45] <Cork> so the browser will have to "fake"
[09:20:53] <undefined_bob> ah and then it just show nothing?
[09:21:08] <Cork> different browsers solve it in different ways
[09:21:30] <Cork> but they will jitter the elements back and forth in different ways to make the match work
[09:21:55] <undefined_bob> not good
[09:23:03] <undefined_bob> I'm going to try it with em border instead of px
[09:23:43] <undefined_bob> but I still dont get the whole thing. I mean the 1px border on the other menu items is fine on the iphone. just those which have sub-menus are not
[09:24:00] <undefined_bob> but both use em for the size and px for the border
[09:26:37] <Cork> undefined_bob: the problem isn't the px border in it self
[09:26:54] <Cork> undefined_bob: it is that where the element starts drawing is offset by subpixles
[09:27:08] <Cork> so thing shift around
[09:27:19] <undefined_bob> like overlapping the borders?
[09:27:24] <Cork> no
[09:27:47] <Cork> as in what i just explained about none integer px values
[09:28:33] <Cork> (doesn't make things easier that a css px doesn't have to be a device px...)
[09:28:35] <undefined_bob> the rounding thing and that the browser have to guess?
[09:28:48] <Cork> not guess
[09:28:53] <Cork> adjust
[09:29:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: lets take a classical example
[09:29:40] <Cork> you have a parent that is 400px wide
[09:29:52] <undefined_bob> yes please. because I would really like to understand it
[09:29:55] <Cork> inside it you have three children with a width of 33%
[09:30:09] <Cork> what width should the different elements have in px?
[09:30:36] <undefined_bob> 133.3
[09:30:48] <Cork> but that can't be drawn so it has to be integers
[09:30:55] <undefined_bob> but thats not exact
[09:31:12] <undefined_bob> int 133
[09:31:21] <Cork> ya, but then what do you do with the extra 1px?
[09:31:31] <Cork> THAT is the problem i was talking about
[09:31:45] <undefined_bob> good question, ya
[09:31:50] <Cork> it is the same, as what you are experiencing, just a simpler to reproduce one
[09:32:27] <Cork> some browsers leave it as extra empty space around the elements
[09:32:35] <Cork> some add it to the first elements
[09:32:37] <Cork> some to the last
[09:32:38] <undefined_bob> and the browser recalculate the em to px, right?
[09:32:46] <Cork> and that is why you get the jittering
[09:32:50] <Cork> they have to
[09:32:57] <Cork> a monitor uses px not em :)
[09:33:03] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:33:26] <undefined_bob> so it was innitially a bad idea to use em :/
[09:33:34] <Cork> not really
[09:33:49] <Cork> but it means you have to take care to allow for the jittering
[09:34:07] <Cork> the end result is better if you do, but it makes setting things up harder
[09:34:34] <undefined_bob> what are methods to take care of it?
[09:34:47] <undefined_bob> for example, I mean
[09:35:02] <Cork> it differs between problem
[09:35:19] <Cork> but basically it is about allowing an element to not be pixel perfect for the design to look good
[09:36:21] <undefined_bob> hm
[09:36:27] <Cork> (yes i know i'm abstract, but it isn't possible to give definitive answers, cause how you work around a problem differs)
[09:36:45] <undefined_bob> yes, I think so
[09:37:27] <undefined_bob> do you see a way how I could solve it? but I feel like it would be complicated
[09:37:41] <Cork> i haven't read through the entire thing
[09:37:55] <undefined_bob> its very much, yes
[09:37:59] <Cork> it would require digging into it deeply and debugging
[09:38:13] <undefined_bob> I tend to give iphones just border:none
[09:38:20] <Cork> and i can't spend that much time on free help...
[09:38:39] <undefined_bob> that was my thought right now "nah I cant pay you enough for that"
[09:39:20] <undefined_bob> and its not worth it, since it really only affect iPhone
[09:40:20] <undefined_bob> even tho, I know it would bugging me when I know there is a flaw and its not "perfect"
[09:43:40] <tilerendering> btw: anybody in here got some experience with i18next?
[09:48:11] <hellyeah> hey
[09:49:21] <undefined_bob> thank you for your time and for the explanations, Cork
[09:49:28] <Cork> np
[09:49:34] <undefined_bob> I just removed them for iPhones
[09:50:03] <undefined_bob> and I keep that in mind when dealing with em agin
[10:21:48] <codecutter> i have a more than one input.option, how do i get the value of the input that has the attribute checked (only one of them does0?
[10:25:56] <Antoni_> Hello guys!
[10:27:06] <nisseni> I'm working with a menu and I cannot get it done right - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/16c1fedb157116efd7c6214dd1a920fc - I'm trying to get a new "column" every 6th list item. This works in HTML but when I render it from jQuery it isn't ending the ul-tag and starting a new one... any ideas?
[10:29:23] <AdamPDotty> codecutter: ask so, someone can understand! You got checkboxes and want the checked one?
[10:30:17] <codecutter> AdamPDotty: that wasn't so hard was it?
[10:30:30] <AdamPDotty> "I have a more than one"
[10:30:40] <AdamPDotty> too many knots for my brain
[10:31:06] <AdamPDotty> then I have to wrap my mind around the idea of checking an input.option, whatever that might be.
[10:31:32] <codecutter> more than one inout with the class option (input.option). Simple enough i should think.
[10:31:38] <taplar> you can use the ':checked' pseudo selector
[10:32:17] <codecutter> $('input.option:checked')?
[10:32:26] <taplar> sure
[10:32:41] <AdamPDotty> nisseni: are you sure the n is set in the beginning?
[10:33:28] <nisseni> AdamPDotty: yeah, I'm making a console.log of the html that should go there and that looks fine. I think jquery is doing something to the DOM, not sure if it's making it valid or something...
[10:34:36] <nisseni> AdamPDotty: The same thing is working when I write it with php...
[10:35:10] <AdamPDotty> either me or the code is missing something
[10:36:10] <Antoni_> Anybodoy know how to change the value of a DateTimeField created with Django? :/
[10:37:26] <AdamPDotty> > n++;
[11:40:07] <Antoni_> Anybody know how to change a datetimefield value with JQ?
[11:40:59] <Antoni_> :) I tried with: $("input:id").val = new val; and it works, but if I do it, I couldn't open the selector again
[11:41:31] <taplar> val() is a method
[11:41:45] <taplar> $(selector).val(newValue)
[11:42:03] <Antoni_> sorry, .value =
[11:42:12] <Antoni_> I have:
[11:42:13] <Antoni_> $("input:text")[3].value = res[0];
[11:42:28] <taplar> k
[11:42:30] <Antoni_> the DateTimeField was created with Django
[11:42:49] <Antoni_> and the format of res is correct
[11:44:12] <taplar> no clue, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855607/django-datetimefield
[11:49:27] <Antoni_> But that isn't my problem, I can save correctly
[11:49:50] <Antoni_> I can't do that my datetimepicker selector open the modal
[11:49:56] <Antoni_> I'll show you 2 picturews
[11:50:43] <Antoni_> this picture show a datetimepicker that work propertly: http://prntscr.com/iepnq1
[11:51:25] <Antoni_> and this another picture, Show my actual problem: http://prntscr.com/iepo8a
[11:51:51] <Antoni_> if you look into the picture, you could see that the input is different
[11:51:52] <taplar> i'm not familiar with django or datatimefields, programatically
[11:52:23] <Antoni_> The background color is different
[11:52:40] <taplar> you're wanting to update one of their fields.  if a datetimepicker is some form of a plugin, usually plugins have their own methods for updating their values
[11:53:08] <Antoni_> Yes, ut it's a problem with my way in JQuery to change the defaultvalue to show into the field when the form is shown
[11:54:11] <Antoni_> Yes taplar, I suppose that that is the problem, but I create the form with Django and at the moment of his creation, I haven't the default value until It is created :/
[12:04:54] <Antoni_> I'll try with a dateTimePicker made in Jqery
[12:05:00] <Antoni_> any recomendation?
[14:13:03] <robertmaxrees> quiet day today
[14:20:01] <taplar> yep
[14:20:12] <taplar> he says 6 minutes later
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> hhahaa
[17:22:14] <gambl0re> hi robert..
[17:53:46] <taplar> any where you go, i'll fooooollow you down.
[17:53:51] <taplar> i'll follow you down, but not that far

[21:23:13] <SpecialTech> hey taplar
[21:24:54] <SpecialTech> this is more a CSS question but haven't had a person respond yet, I'm trying to create a modal that can open from different anchors but pull up the correct content w.o JS/jQuery. Any thoughts?
