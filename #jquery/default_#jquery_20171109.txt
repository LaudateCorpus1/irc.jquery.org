[02:30:00] <Amis> Hello! I created a jQuery object with 'var item = $();' then added several <div>s with 'item.add(...);'. How do I filter this set of elements? .find() does not seem to do anything on 'item'
[02:40:56] <Amis> Here's what I mean: https://jsfiddle.net/zn9twt8p/
[02:41:15] <Amis> Shouldn't the find return 1 element? Am I missing something?
[02:41:36] <Amis> Or this isn't how it works?
[02:41:42] <Cork> Amis: you almost answered it you're self :) .filter()
[02:42:13] <Amis> Cork, oh... well
[02:42:16] <Amis> Thanks!
[02:42:24] <Cork> Amis: .find is for finding children to the element in the selection
[02:42:30] <Cork> .filter is to filter the selection
[02:42:35] <Amis> I see
[02:42:39] <Cork> and .add adds to the selection so...
[02:43:35] <Amis> That kinda makes sense
[02:44:07] <Cork> Amis: personally i would recommend this structure https://jsfiddle.net/zn9twt8p/1/
[02:44:26] <Cork> it generates a little less gc as you don't rebuild the array for each call to create
[02:44:56] <Cork> an also you don't need / in the element creation
[02:45:04] <Cork> $('<div>') is enough
[02:45:54] <Cork> (what you give there isn't html jquery detects the syntax with regex and calls document.createElement)
[02:46:21] <Amis> Cork, I use .add and .not aswell on the collection in the real code so the jquery collection seemed a better choice
[02:46:39] <Cork> Amis: in the create function or after it is all done?
[02:46:59] <Cork> cause you could do items = $(items) when you've constructed it all if you want
[02:47:07] <Cork> then you would only do it once
[02:47:13] <Cork> instead of for each call
[02:47:24] <Amis> Cork, anytime based on user interaction managing a collection of about 100 divs and adding and removing as needed
[02:47:49] <Cork> hmm, a bit too abstract
[02:48:22] <Cork> anyway .add(jquery object) will tag the dom element from the element and the jquery object on the left and then create a new object with all of them in
[02:48:47] <Cork> *will take* -_-'
[02:49:17] <Cork> just be conscious of that if you end up in a performance sensitive situation
[02:49:30] <Amis> But the actual DOM is not copied I take (since I can still manipulate the elements in the collection and it reflects in the rendered web page)
[02:49:51] <Cork> you never copy dom elements
[02:50:08] <Cork> you can clone them, but that requires a call to .clone()
[02:50:11] <Amis> This collection is a helper for applying and removing classes without the need of actually finding the elements each time
[02:50:15] <Cork> the rest of dom handling is by reference
[04:32:56] <Amnesia> hi question, I'm trying to select all input elements, that are descendants of #foo, of which the value attribute equals bar.
[04:33:26] <Amnesia> so I tried $("#foo first [value=bar]") but that's not doing the job
[04:33:30] <Amnesia> what am I missing out:)?
[04:41:27] <Amnesia> the same applies for $("#foo input:first [value=bar]") btw
[05:33:13] <Deusdeorum> How can I make something like this more generic without adding $(".tiptext-1").mouseover(function() {... to every popup? https://jsfiddle.net/b283nbx5/
[06:10:49] <Kartagis> Deusdeorum: addClass('tiptext')
[09:46:26] <Neo1> Hi guys!
[09:46:41] <Neo1> Who does know how to check site in the bookmarks?
[09:47:00] <Cork> check what?
[09:47:46] <Neo1> Is it possible to do? I've put on the site the big button and what delete it if the user added my site
[09:48:07] <Cork> no, you can't force the user to bookmark the site
[09:48:12] <Neo1> check site in bookmarks the browser
[09:48:20] <Neo1> why?
[09:48:31] <Cork> cause that would leak private data
[09:48:48] <Cork> just cause a user visits a site in the browser doesn't mean the code on the site is trusted
[09:48:53] <Neo1> if put big button on half of screen user will add my site for delete that button
[09:49:34] <Cork> or just leave the site
[09:49:41] <Neo1> and what I can to do? How to delete that button after adding to bookmarks?
[09:49:59] <Cork> you could store a cookie if the user pushes the button
[09:50:06] <Cork> but that's as far as you can get
[09:51:16] <Neo1> it's the site the casino, User will not leave it just simply. My partner is the newbie SEO optimizer He said it would be well
[09:51:41] <Cork> Neo1: you have two options, 1. get over it 2. hack the browser
[09:51:50] <Cork> there is no access to the users private data from a website
[09:52:11] <Neo1> and when user lost cookie I'll show button?
[09:52:17] <Neo1> ok the understood )
[09:52:36] <Neo1> well understood
[09:52:58] <Neo1> it's not well
[09:56:32] <Neo1> Cork: What does mean 'get over it'?
[09:56:55] <Neo1> what does the 'get over it' means?
[09:57:16] <Cork> it means that move one and do other things as what you asked for isn't possible
[09:58:06] <Neo1> understood it's 'the end'
[09:58:31] <Neo1> ok thanks. Hope you do know what you are saying :)
[10:00:22] <Neo1> Cork: I have common question about the technology. It's about javascript libs
[10:00:48] <Neo1> I don't know should learn 'angularjs' or not, or enough 'jQuery'?
[10:01:52] <Neo1> what is differ between jQuery and angularjs, for me seems if you know jQuery that doesn't have sens to learn angular.js.
[10:02:12] <Cork> Neo1: no it isn't about libts, it is about if you can do it in js at all
[10:02:20] <Cork> *libs*
[10:02:52] <Cork> and except from extensions js can't read browser bookarks
[10:03:21] <Neo1> I've watched recent video on youtube about web technology which should learn in 2017 years and there was saying 'angularjs' is last technology, but about jQuery was saing but not much
[10:03:48] <Neo1> angularjs is common lib? But jQuery also common lib
[10:05:11] <Neo1> My mind learn something one and enough, Doesn't have sense learn angularjs if you don't know good jQuery? This both libs are using for do front end.
[10:05:29] <Neo1> Have sense learn node.js and mangodb
[10:06:58] <Neo1> I didn't know it's last technology :) node.js is probably 5 years and it is considering as the modern technology. So say The UP TO DATE
[10:09:12] <Neo1> I want make the chat 'American chat'
[10:10:19] <Neo1> jQuery for the front end and node.js for the backend
[10:22:30] <Neo1> Cork, quots (Neo1: with Jquery you think with CSS selectors, user events, DOM manipulations. With AngularJS you think with UI bricks, inputs and outputs, templates.) ?
[10:22:49] <Neo1> seems angularjs is decent thing and should to be learned?
[10:23:36] <Neo1> Cork, (5:18:13 PM - Elarcis: Neo1: JQuery is a "low level" library to ease manipulations made to the DOM)
[10:24:00] <Neo1> jQuery is low level lib, angularjs is high level. and up to date technology
[10:25:08] <Neo1> quot (5:24:03 PM - SargoDarya: Neo1: The origin of jQuery was to basically have a library which abstracts away browser differences and make it a little bit easier to write javascript which works over all browsers. That was back then when you still had to support IE6/7)  ???
[10:25:37] <Neo1> quot (Nowadays you have a little saner APIs in JS which you can use so you don't need to use jQuery anymore.)
[10:25:59] <Neo1> is it true? jQuery is dying?
[10:26:33] <Neo1> ok, anyway should overlook angularjs
[10:37:31] <taplar> Neo1: jQuery and angular serve different purposes.  It's not about newer or older.  It's about filling a need.
[10:38:14] <Neo1> seems I don't need angularjs. For me seems they have equal aims
[10:38:17] <taplar> If you have a mid to large front end application, or an application maintained by a larger developer team, a framework like angular can be benificial
[10:38:32] <taplar> jQuery's goal is to normalize interactions with the DOM.
[10:38:56] <taplar> Angular's goal is to provide a framework for building entire applications, so you don't have to re-create the boilerplate that is common in most applications.
[10:39:47] <Neo1> ok, Should watch video lessons for better understanding
[10:41:44] <Neo1> jQuery has many plugins and big community, doesn't have sens something change now. it takes time to learn, better learn deeper jQuery I think it's bring more profit
[10:42:01] <taplar> if all you need is to enhance a website
[10:42:02] <Neo1> it will bring*
[10:42:12] <Neo1> I need create chat
[10:42:14] <taplar> but if you are building an entire application, angular can make sense
[10:42:23] <Neo1> backend will use node.js socket.io
[10:42:33] <Neo1> and for front end will use jQuery
[10:42:34] <taplar> or if you are just concerned with the model and view part of the front end, other options exist such as React and Vue
[10:43:20] <Neo1> no it's need time for learn all other options. I will do it using jQuery better
[10:43:49] <Neo1> don't have time for learning. Else have to learn socket.io and node.js
[10:43:57] <taplar> *shrug*  up to you.  i'm just offering information about why the different options exist
[10:44:50] <Neo1> and why for entire application jQuery doesn't suite? So many prepared plugins, it's very suite for any apps
[10:44:56] <Neo1> I would say )
[10:45:04] <taplar> because you have to write everything from scratch
[10:45:15] <taplar> frameworks already have the boilerplate written for you
[10:45:53] <Neo1> but that framework doesn't have big number of the prepared plugins it's con
[10:46:19] <taplar> jQuery can be used with angular
[10:46:32] <taplar> in fact it includes a smaller subset of jquery in it as $jq
[10:46:43] <taplar> you can always use jquery plugins in an angular app
[10:46:47] <taplar> it's all javascript
[10:46:59] <Neo1> yes I was said about it angularjs is made by using jQuery
[10:47:05] <taplar> bi
[10:47:06] <taplar> no
[10:47:07] <taplar> it's not
[10:47:22] <taplar> angularjs is written in javascript.  it's not written in jquery
[10:47:30] <Neo1> oh, ok
[10:48:52] <Neo1> listen I've overlooked a few books about node.js and there was some books that called as 'node.js mongoDB and angularjs' This technology is using together
[10:49:30] <taplar> sure
[10:49:33] <Neo1> there a few books where this all describe altogether
[10:49:41] <taplar> sure
[10:49:45] <Neo1> but I can use instead angularjs jQuery?
[10:49:56] <taplar> if you want to, yes
[10:50:12] <Neo1> I don't have the choose. I need it
[10:50:17] <taplar> node.js (server), mongoDB (database), angularjs (front end)
[10:50:24] <taplar> you can swap out any of those pieces for something else
[10:50:40] <taplar> you are not forced to use any of those three
[10:50:45] <taplar> you could use an apache server
[10:50:50] <taplar> an sql database
[10:50:54] <taplar> react as a front end
[10:50:58] <taplar> or plain js as a frontend
[10:51:01] <taplar> you are not restricted
[10:51:21] <Neo1> yes I know. Would be well to use instead mongoDB MysQl, but I afraid it's impossible
[10:51:27] <Neo1> it's good
[10:51:34] <taplar> mongoDB mysql?
[10:51:40] <taplar> that's not a ting
[10:51:42] <taplar> *thing
[10:51:56] <Neo1> instead mongoDB use MysQl
[10:52:10] <taplar> ah.  yeah, you can.  like i said, you can use anything
[10:52:14] <Neo1> I want to do chat 'American chat' for native speakers
[10:52:24] <taplar> tons of those exist
[10:52:28] <taplar> *already
[10:52:39] <Neo1> and seems better use one database
[10:52:41] <Neo1> ok
[10:53:21] <taplar> at least from my point of view it's harder to find a chat room that is -not- native english
[10:53:24] <Neo1> see but it's not sane if you will learn front-end frameworks which designed for do equal things? It's obvious
[10:54:07] <taplar> of course you don't learn everything.  you do preliminary investigations to see what might work for your problem, and then you see if it will
[10:54:14] <taplar> if it doesn't then you try to find the next thing that might
[10:54:51] <taplar> but you should always keep your ear in the development community for new technologies and ask questions about why they exist and what benefits they have  over what you may already be using
[10:55:18] <taplar> just because it's new doesn't mean you learn it.  but if there is a chance it may be better for one of your projects, it doesn't hurt to investigate it more
[10:55:35] <Neo1> yes, I tried to do this but what I found it's poor chats. I can't that chat compare with chat where I spoke sometimes.
[10:55:48] <Neo1> understood. I agree with you.
[10:56:31] <Neo1> really each USA chats is so poor. this Ukrainian chat http://bizarre.kiev.ua is the best and biggest Russian chat
[10:56:44] <taplar> ok?
[10:56:53] <Neo1> I couldn't find something similar in English
[10:56:53] <taplar> what do you mean poor?
[10:57:06] <Neo1> I mean little people and bad UI
[10:57:27] <taplar> ?
[10:57:48] <Neo1> or font so small or it made one room only, bad smiles, It's as made not for humans
[10:58:31] <Neo1> difficult find big chat where you can practice English
[10:58:35] <taplar> traditional irc can be used with any irc client, which you can customize to whatever font you want
[10:59:30] <Neo1> taplar: how my English? Has it improved now?
[10:59:57] <taplar> I can understand you pretty well, I believe
[11:00:03] <Neo1> do you know me? I've spoken with you later?
[11:00:10] <taplar> but i'm not an authority on the language, :)
[11:00:56] <Neo1> taplar: no you can compare, we spoke with you a month later, about streamline. I said that I think create framework
[11:01:45] <taplar> I have a hard time remembering things from the day before yesterday.  A month is pushing your luck.
[11:01:51] <Neo1> taplar: that I didn't learn grammar, Now to do every day 8 - 10 exercises, and I'm feeling better
[11:02:03] <Neo1> taplar: ok, I remember you good
[11:02:10] <taplar> Also remembering how people talking isn't really something I pay attention to.
[11:02:17] <taplar> *talk
[11:02:59] <Neo1> taplar: see this my framework, you helped me and we speak about it https://github.com/kselax/kselax-framework
[11:03:11] <Neo1> you recall me
[11:03:39] <taplar> not at all
[11:04:03] <taplar> I remember a while back you came in and said I help you with something of the framework, but I don't remember recommending to you that you build one.
[11:04:16] <taplar> I can't remember every recommending to anyone to build a framework.
[11:04:19] <taplar> *ever
[11:04:21] <Neo1> ok, passed this, I have been learning English grammar for a month and interesting is it getting better )))
[11:06:16] <Neo1> taplar: about time save. Ok passed this. I think I will do better more exercises on English grammar than learning angualarjs that will do equal thing as jQuery
[11:06:44] <Neo1> just set personal priority
[11:09:54] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/   <-- how to clone  a row
[11:10:38] <taplar> which row and when?
[11:12:24] <jak2000> last td see a button Copiar  = Clone
[11:12:51] <taplar> i see no clone button
[11:13:00] <taplar> all i see is a menu
[11:14:03] <jak2000> wait adapting.
[11:15:44] <jak2000> done: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/1/
[11:19:39] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/2/   <--updated
[11:21:14] <jak2000> done: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/3/
[11:21:27] <jak2000> my dude is..... the ids, need change after clone?
[11:27:01] <jak2000> taplar: after clone the row how to change the value of first col: to -100 ? http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/4/
[11:42:00] <taplar> sorry, got pulled away from my desk
[11:42:34] <jak2000> ok understand continue... working... thanks
[11:42:44] <jak2000> in any time recommend a jquery tutorial please
[11:42:46] <jak2000> thx
[11:43:16] <taplar> so you want to change the first value to -100?
[11:43:45] <jak2000> yes of cloned.... row
[11:44:01] <jak2000> and if can change all ids of each control of cloned row
[11:44:52] <jak2000> sorry rephrase, change the ids of cloned row (input, select option..)
[11:45:01] <taplar> ah, ok i was fixing to ask
[11:46:16] <taplar> so it looks like only the row has the id of _9118, all the others are like _1
[11:46:19] <taplar> is that accurate?
[11:48:02] <jak2000> checking
[11:49:33] <jak2000> <tr id='row_9118'   <-- change this in cloned row to : <tr id='row_'  or: <tr id='row_-100' is possible?  or <tr id='row_0'
[11:49:58] <jak2000> after this i need rerun and all cloend rows save to database...
[11:50:00] <taplar> for just the row, or all things with an id in the row?
[11:51:33] <jak2000> all things (cloned) with -100 or i think change all _1 to _0   <-- for detect is a new or cloned control... of course all ids would be different
[11:52:31] <taplar> are you wanting all new rows to have an id of row_-100?
[11:52:43] <jak2000> if possible yes
[11:52:49] <jak2000> or -100 -101 -102 and so on
[11:52:50] <taplar> you understand that is invalid markup, right?
[11:53:10] <taplar> id's can't be repeated
[11:54:10] <taplar> if you want to mark a row as new you could do that just as easily by throwing a class or a data field on the row
[11:54:52] <taplar> $clone.addClass('newRow') or $clone.data('newRow', true)
[12:00:01] <jak2000> ok
[12:01:59] <jak2000> if use: $clone.data('newRow', true) <---  'newRow' is the class righr?
[12:02:02] <jak2000> *right?
[12:02:30] <taplar> that version isn't a class, but a data attribute
[12:03:05] <taplar> similar to <tag data-new-row="true"
[12:03:13] <jak2000> ok
[12:04:33] <jak2000> and $clone ? when i run i get an error $clone is not defined
[12:04:37] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/7/
[12:05:04] <taplar> uh, right ... ?  you commented out the part that made the clone
[12:05:40] <jak2000> ahh understand
[12:06:25] <jak2000> understand data-newRow .... tell me is a new Row... ok...
[12:24:53] <jak2000> $clone.find(   <-- can find a class?
[12:24:56] <jak2000> or name?
[12:25:49] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.find can take anyelector
[12:26:02] <robertmaxrees> any selector that $() takes
[12:28:49] <jak2000> ooo yes  http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/8/    <--- any advice how to change the id to next.....myCount...
[12:30:15] <robertmaxrees> how would you set the ID on any other element?
[12:30:52] <jak2000> checking: .attr('id', 'id'+ cloneCount++)
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> don't you already have myCount?
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> though really
[12:31:32] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to get the number of rows?
[12:32:27] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[12:33:32] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/10/
[12:33:35] <jak2000> done :)
[12:33:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah so
[12:33:43] <robertmaxrees> don't use a state var.
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> just get the current number of trs
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5qLzf35/11/
[12:34:38] <jak2000> defined: myCount   as global variable....
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[12:34:44] <jak2000> checking
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it.
[12:36:18] <jak2000> robertmaxrees first id: idTarima_1  .... when clone next id:idTarima_11  clone again: idTarima_21
[12:36:28] <jak2000> with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5qLzf35/11/
[12:40:01] <jak2000> changed: $clone.find('.clIdTarima').attr('id', 'idTarima_' + (parseInt($('.tr_clone').length) + 1));
[12:40:05] <jak2000> and worked
[12:40:06] <user_corrupt> is it ok to $.ajax post json data without serialising it first or something?
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:40:17] <jak2000> now.. how to add a button at the end next to button Clone?
[12:40:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that worked because you're wrapping the math in parens.
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> you can kill the parseInt.
[12:40:39] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt you can, just depends on what your server expects.
[12:40:54] <robertmaxrees> user_corrupt but i would come up with a standard format of some kind to avoid headaches later.
[12:41:43] <user_corrupt> cool, thanks
[12:41:53] <user_corrupt> net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED is the error that's coming back ATM
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> that means the domain is bad.
[12:42:47] <user_corrupt> oh, yeah
[12:42:54] <user_corrupt> need to open vpn
[12:42:57] <user_corrupt> just remembered
[12:43:42] <jak2000> robertmaxrees if remove parseInt concatenate the 1... now sum i am right?
[12:43:57] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 huh?
[12:44:07] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 .length already returns a number.
[12:44:45] <robertmaxrees> the issue with my original one was left-to-right evaluation.  the id + lenght was getting coerced to a string.
[12:50:51] <jak2000> done with:  $clone.find('.clIdTarima').attr('id', 'idTarima_' + ($('.tr_clone').length + 1));
[12:50:53] <jak2000> i am righ/
[12:50:54] <jak2000> ?
[12:51:56] <robertmaxrees> should be.
[12:52:04] <jak2000> the parenthesis :)
[12:52:23] <jak2000> how to add a button? after clone button ( a button with save AS... )?
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> you already know how to append elements to a container.
[12:53:03] <robertmaxrees> just do that (shrug)
[12:54:17] <jak2000> mmm something like this: $clone.find(.btnCopiar).add();   ?
[12:55:35] <robertmaxrees> .add()??
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not what add does.
[12:56:00] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle is appending elements right now.
[12:56:24] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/14/
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> except you don't want to append to the button, right?
[12:57:10] <jak2000> right
[12:57:24] <jak2000> then clone the button .btnCopiar  :)
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:57:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> why not insert AFTER the button?
[12:59:04] <jak2000> $clone.find('.btnCopiar').after("<button type='button' class='btn btn-info'>Save</button>");   <--- show me the console: 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[12:59:23] <robertmaxrees> or give the TD that should contain those a class and append to that class.
[12:59:31] <robertmaxrees> fiddle duder
[13:01:17] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/18/  <--- always 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> var $clone ='' $tr.clone(); ?
[13:02:45] <jak2000> no error: $clone.find('.clBtnClone').append($("<button type='button' class='btn btn-info'>Save</button>"));
[13:02:51] <jak2000> but not happend the effect
[13:02:54] <robertmaxrees> that's causing your error.
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> the link i pasted.
[13:03:08] <jak2000> ooo sorry
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> also: no need to reselect the tr to clone - your code will keep adding save buttons: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5qLzf35/20/
[13:03:37] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/c5qLzf35/21/
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last remark :)
[13:04:10] <jak2000> yes...
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> and then the fiddle that fixes it.
[13:04:22] <jak2000> thanks
[13:06:22] <jak2000> for change the text of first column cloned... need a div? and refer  by .text  ?
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:07:15] <jak2000> cloned row i want change: 9118   by -100   (by sample) need add a class on this td?
[13:07:57] <robertmaxrees> the clIdTarima?
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> also: your code it causin duplicate IDs.
[13:08:29] <robertmaxrees> *is
[13:08:42] <jak2000> <td class='myRowId'>9118 <input type='text' id='idTarima_1' name='idTarima' value='9118' size='7' readonly='readonly' class='input_align_right2 clIdTarima' />
[13:08:47] <jak2000> the first 9118
[13:09:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the class I just pointed out.
[13:09:07] <robertmaxrees> you already have a class on there.
[13:09:11] <robertmaxrees> so select it.
[13:09:13] <jak2000> ok...
[13:09:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what the confusion is, honestly.
[13:09:39] <jak2000> forget
[13:09:41] <taplar_lunch> you'll probably want to put a span around the text
[13:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you just did something similar a few seconds ago.
[13:09:49] <robertmaxrees> also: you need to kill those IDs.
[13:10:06] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> also: your code it causin duplicate IDs. <---- yes i need change it.....
[13:10:17] <robertmaxrees> do you need the IDs in the first place?
[13:10:59] <jak2000> not important
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> then kill 'em :)
[13:11:26] <jak2000> remove right
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:18:08] <jak2000> muhc thanks...
[13:28:33] <jak2000> working on adapt this to my production code: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/bx8t52a6/
[13:32:10] <NitroLiq> Will debounce affect an on load event, for example if I have a load and resize event combined?
[13:33:20] <NitroLiq> Or, does it make more sense to keep the load and resize events seperated, just repeating the if/else inside them?
[13:34:30] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq how would you combine them?
[13:35:07] <taplar> also an if/else doesn't really sound like the way to implement a debounce either
[13:35:24] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run the same code within both a resize and a load?
[13:38:32] <NitroLiq> Probably like #34 here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1974788/combine-onload-and-onresize-jquery
[13:38:48] <robertmaxrees> #34?
[13:39:05] <taplar> the one with 34 up votes
[13:39:13] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/24721767/923919
[13:39:19] <taplar> on('load resize'
[13:39:32] <NitroLiq> Essentially, I just want the debounce resize but not the load, and only have the conditional once (window.width conditional)
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> if you click 'share' on an answer it directly links it.
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> so basically.
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> abstract out your resize logic to a function.
[13:40:14] <robertmaxrees> then use it in a debounced resize handler and in your load handler.
[13:42:22] <taplar> i had little debounce fiddle the other day.  *searches*
[13:42:46] <taplar> NitroLiq: https://jsfiddle.net/6bp0mzap/
[13:44:02] <taplar> i would though be interested in how you performed your debounce with an if/else
[13:44:51] <NitroLiq> I basically culled the debounce from underscore so it's pretty easy.
[13:45:03] <taplar> ah
[13:45:48] <NitroLiq> You can see it here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gXgdma
[13:46:08] <NitroLiq> no load function, yet. I have one but it's seperate
[13:57:05] <stevooo> How can i exclude the first and last <option> to be selected? https://jsfiddle.net/nxb7vgck/14/
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> check the value inside the handler.
[14:00:15] <stevooo> robertmaxrees: and then?
[14:00:51] <taplar> what exactly do you mean exclude them from "be selected"?
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> check to see if it's either of the options you don't want.
[14:01:52] <stevooo> taplar: i want to exclude them from my function
[14:01:56] <stevooo> my .change call
[14:02:04] <taplar> k
[14:02:22] <taplar> i was going to say if you didn't want them selectable at all you'd throw a disabled on them, but nvm, :)
[14:02:47] <stevooo> maybe an if-statement works fine here?
[14:02:48] <robertmaxrees> though now i gotta ask
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting the value of the button to match the value of the dropdown?
[14:04:19] <stevooo> because thats how the client wants it
[14:04:27] <robertmaxrees> that's... odd.  but ok./
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, if (!oneOIfTheValuesIWant) { }
[14:04:47] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy.
[14:06:04] <taplar> you could also stick a data field on them to signify that
[14:06:33] <taplar> little more clarity
[14:07:09] <stevooo> btw, now i use the selector $("#stad.. twice, how can i use $(this) under $("#stad").change..{ but still have the "option:selected"
[14:07:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find()
[14:07:55] <stevooo> ok ty
[14:08:13] <stevooo> thats equivalent to $("#stad option:selected") ?
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to fill in the .find()
[14:08:46] <robertmaxrees> it takes a selector.
[14:11:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/nxb7vgck/15/  version with a data element
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> *attribute
[14:11:59] * robertmaxrees ducks
[14:12:13] <taplar> my b
[14:14:26] <stevooo> This roomservice coffee taste like...
[14:14:49] <taplar> burnt coffee?
[14:15:26] <stevooo> na, it just taste bad
[14:15:28] <taplar> heh, though are you referring to real room service, or are you taking a swing at this room.  :O
[14:16:58] <stevooo> real, im currently staying at a hotel
[14:17:07] <stevooo> until i get my apartment..
[14:17:11] <taplar> business trip?
[14:17:14] <taplar> ah
[14:17:17] <stevooo> Yes
[14:17:36] <stevooo> or more like 9 months contract.
[14:18:07] <taplar> that's cool
[14:18:38] <stevooo> taplar: why .on("change)" instead .change?
[14:18:45] <taplar> .change() is just a wrapper for on
[14:18:45] <stevooo> any specific reason behind it
[14:19:01] <taplar> so you're losing one layer of abstraction that really doesn't do anything for you
[14:19:08] <robertmaxrees> also consistency
[14:19:16] <taplar> especially since on() is one step away from a delegate binding
[14:19:18] <robertmaxrees> easier to find all handlers if they're all bound with .on()
[14:19:28] <stevooo> I see
[14:19:33] <stevooo> I'll keep that in mind.
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> maintainability.
[14:31:43] <poboy> so this was tough enough for me. This function reloads the page and on line 37 it displays an error message.  How can I tell it to only display the latest message?  https://kopy.io/cuvd8
[14:45:35] <taplar> the latest message?
[14:47:47] <poboy> .prepend('<div class="row"><div id="errors" class="alert alert-danger">' + returned.errors + '</div></div>
[14:47:57] <robido> poboy: you'll have to grab the end of the returned.errors array/object I'd assume
[14:48:03] <poboy> so each time this function is called it prepends a new message, on top of the existing ones
[14:48:18] <robido> I would assume something along the lines of: returned.errors[returned.errors.length - 1]
[14:48:27] <robido> have to see the data in console.log to confirm
[14:48:42] <taplar> poboy: so you only want the last message to be displayed yes?
[14:48:51] <poboy> taplar, yes
[14:49:16] <taplar> i'd suggest one of two approaches then
[14:49:55] <taplar> either include the error row on the page on page load, hidden, and in the case that you have an error, set the #errors text and then show the row.  then future errors would do the same thing, so you'd only have the single error row
[14:49:59] <taplar> or
[14:50:20] <taplar> add a second class to the row like errorRow or something
[14:50:40] <taplar> then you could check if that exists.  If it does, replace that row with your new row.  Else, add the row
[14:50:52] <poboy> ok, I'll try that.  Thanks
[14:50:57] <taplar> personally i'd go with the first option
[14:56:39] <stevooo> `api load
[14:57:05] <stevooo> bot killed?
[14:57:42] <robertmaxrees> hasn't worked for, like, a year./
[14:57:57] <stevooo> okay
[14:58:17] <stevooo> well, i havent been here since 2010 or something
[14:58:18] <stevooo> :P
[14:58:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:59:24] <stevooo> i wrote jQuery back in 2008-2010, then stopped. Now im kinda back to it
[15:00:15] <stevooo> matlab stole my time..
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:02:30] <taplar> trying to remember if I did matlab in college
[15:03:34] <stevooo> robertmaxrees: Can i encrypt html in jQuery/JS then decrypt using a key using a request thats only valid from the webserver?
[15:03:59] <stevooo> taplar: if you studied CS or ME you probably used it.
[15:04:23] <taplar> yeah, i just found the picture on wiki.  pretty sure i did some in some physics labs
[15:04:33] <taplar> completely forgot that stuff, lol
[15:04:53] <stevooo> I prefer matlab over microsoft excel
[15:05:09] <stevooo> Im only using excel when doing pivot diagrams
[15:07:09] <taplar> and you're wanting to encrypt html?
[15:07:28] <stevooo> yes just for testing
[15:07:34] <stevooo> no specific reason
[15:08:46] <taplar> so like the html would already be encrypted and then the client would have to request the key from the server to know how to decrypt it?
[15:09:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:09:55] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:11:51] <stevooo> taplar: i'll pseudocode something
[15:12:00] <stevooo> maybe it will explain more
[15:12:03] <robertmaxrees> stevooo why do you want to encrypt html in the first place?
[15:12:27] <robertmaxrees> like, at its base, it seems really odd.
[15:12:31] <taplar> ^
[15:12:49] <robertmaxrees> you should already be serving over https.  if that'
[15:12:55] <robertmaxrees> *that's compromised, you're SOL
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> encrypting HTML/JS/whatever for the client also doesn't make sense.
[15:13:20] <robertmaxrees> since you'd have to send the key to the client somehow, which means that data is all visible anyway./
[15:13:29] <taplar> heh
[15:14:15] <taplar> i took his "no specific reason" statement to possibly mean he's doing it just for the funnzies.
[15:14:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd mess around with encryption/decryption with something tbh.
[15:14:43] <robertmaxrees> *something else
[15:14:56] <stevooo> :)
[15:15:07] <stevooo> well, you really need to show the key to the client?
[15:15:20] <robertmaxrees> how else would the client know how to decrypt it?
[15:15:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll hand it data with no keys.
[15:15:53] <taplar> otherwise you'd send the data to the server, it decrypt it, and send the result.  but then why decrypt in the first place
[15:15:53] <stevooo> you're probably correct, but ill write something down anyways
[15:16:04] <taplar> err, encrypt
[15:16:06] <robertmaxrees> just serve over https and let ssl do what it's meant for.
[15:16:10] <taplar> ^
[15:16:23] <robertmaxrees> like, it does that for you.
[15:16:30] <robertmaxrees> but with the entire connection.
[15:17:05] <stevooo> robertmaxrees: but SSL doesnt fully help.
[15:17:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> how?
[15:17:13] <stevooo> what i mean, can you mask html ?
[15:17:16] <stevooo> and css
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:17:29] <taplar> mask from whom?
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^
[15:17:44] <stevooo> ^.^
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to prevent users from stealing your stuff?
[15:18:00] <stevooo> im just thinking
[15:18:02] <stevooo> but yes
[15:18:10] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> 1: the user can already grab all of your rendered html/css/etc using tools built into the browser.  nothing will stop that part.  so you have an easily defeated mechanism.
[15:19:02] <robertmaxrees> 2: if that kind of theft were rampant, sites like facebook, google, etc. would have a lot of problems.
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> but it just doesn't really happen.
[15:20:45] <stevooo> so .html(load("getallshitfromhere.php?=123131bbad"))
[15:20:49] <stevooo> would never work?
[15:21:01] <taplar> define 'work'
[15:21:37] <stevooo> well, you say the html returned content from the .load call could be copied by the client
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> it'll function, but it won't protect anything.
[15:21:43] <robertmaxrees> yes,.
[15:22:06] <taplar> right click page, inspect element, boom, all the page markup
[15:22:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:22:11] <stevooo> but if the client inspect the page, he would only see the js code ?
[15:22:19] <taplar> nupe
[15:22:27] <taplar> if they view source, they'd see the original
[15:22:28] <robertmaxrees> the user has access to whatever it renderd.
[15:22:30] <taplar> but inspect is not the same
[15:22:39] <robertmaxrees> also: any network requests can be inspected.
[15:22:41] <stevooo> i've been away too long..
[15:22:54] <robertmaxrees> it's been like that for a looooong time.
[15:23:05] <robertmaxrees> firebug really laid the foundation for that,.
[15:23:50] <stevooo> yes you're right, remember now.
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> you only need as much security as your site really requires.  nobody is gonna steal your stuff.
[15:26:27] <taplar> otherwise, copyrights exist for a reason
[15:27:56] <taplar> man today is dragging
[15:30:47] <stevooo> I agree
[15:31:09] <stevooo> so dragging i've probably looked at my bitcoin values 1000x times already..

[15:36:10] <robertmaxrees> except instead of hosting them on their own boxes, they used our hosting.
[15:36:44] <robertmaxrees> so we did a check on referring domain and served up an ad for our site instead in those cases.
[15:36:53] <taplar> lmao, nyce
[15:37:12] <taplar> "This product and more, available on build.com!"
[15:37:21] <robertmaxrees> basically :)
[15:37:23] <robertmaxrees> it was pretty lol
