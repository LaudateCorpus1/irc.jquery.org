[00:11:43] <deepy> This is my first attempt at a jQuery plugin, have I done something in a terrible way?
[00:11:46] <deepy> https://dpaste.de/uMhW
[00:12:17] <deepy> there's still some unfinished things, 20-22 is a stub, 34-37 is getting the treatment that 13-24 is
[00:12:43] <Cork> deepy: you're expecting the plugin to only work with one element
[00:12:50] <deepy> Yes
[00:12:54] <Cork> you should have an .each loop around the code
[00:13:01] <Cork> its how plugins is expected to work
[00:13:28] <deepy> Fair play, I'll fix that
[00:13:50] <Cork> looks ok apart from that
[00:14:04] <Cork> indention error on line 37
[00:14:32] <deepy> That might be from eclipse, I generally have jslint done through ST3, but this was copied into eclipse and some minor things done
[00:14:36] <Mark_2> hi
[00:14:40] <Mark_2> good evening.
[00:14:45] <Mark_2> i have a question.
[00:15:02] <Mark_2> how do i create a firefox tablike function using jquery?
[00:15:28] <prohobo> jquery ui probably
[00:15:32] <prohobo> has tabs
[00:15:37] <Mark_2> urhggggg
[00:15:40] <Mark_2> sure, but
[00:15:48] <prohobo> BUT WHAT
[00:15:54] <Mark_2> but but but
[00:15:56] <Uhkis> :D
[00:15:59] <prohobo> it works fine, you can skin it, you can extend it
[00:16:03] <prohobo> just use it
[00:16:16] <deepy> Mark_2: try to explain as clearly as possible what you want, what you've tried and why that wasn't enough
[00:16:24] * deepy tickles Uhkis
[00:16:30] <Mark_2> BUT IT’S primitive!
[00:16:31] <Uhkis> teehehee
[00:17:01] <prohobo> what do you mean primitive?
[00:17:51] <Mark_2> for example, how do i have tabs rearrangable?
[00:18:30] <Cork> Mark_2: draggable
[00:18:46] <Cork> its a jquery ui component
[00:18:46] <prohobo> you can mix and match jquery ui functionalities
[00:19:10] <Cork> you would prob have to add the glue yourself, cause i don't think tabs has that support built in
[00:19:37] <Mark_2> i’ll show you in a graphic
[00:19:43] <Mark_2> hard to explain it in written words
[00:32:34] <Mark_2> wow now everyone’s very quiet.
[00:32:58] <prohobo> ffufufufuf
[00:33:01] <prohobo> tere
[00:33:03] <Mark_2> can anybody help me code this website?  https://www.dropbox.com/s/tz1g0nu4mbicysa/1.jpg?dl=0
[00:33:05] <prohobo> there
[00:33:23] <Mark_2> im thinking about tabs that can be opened and closed.
[00:33:32] <Mark_2> not tabs that are just sitting in the fixed place.
[00:33:55] <Mark_2> i think the most tricky part is having tabs know its position when it’s opened.
[00:35:55] <prohobo> i see
[00:37:29] <Cork> Mark_2: the tab position is related to its position in the dom
[00:37:34] <Cork> so shouldn't be that hard
[00:38:09] <Mark_2> only if i could understand what you understand in your brain Cork .
[00:38:16] <Cork> lol
[00:40:10] <prohobo> what is with korean and japanese companies
[00:40:19] <Mark_2> hmm? prohobo
[00:40:33] <Mark_2> btw, my user interface is better than facebook UI im sure
[00:40:46] <prohobo> use modern design!
[00:41:09] <Mark_2> prohobo: what’s modern desing?
[00:41:11] <Mark_2> *design?
[00:41:19] <prohobo> material/flat design
[00:41:31] <prohobo> with an emphasis on mobile viewing
[00:41:35] <Mark_2> you have any example of material design?
[00:41:46] <Cork> ?g google material design
[00:41:46] <Mark_2> i surely haven’t seen any ‘material’ lately.
[00:41:46] <b-ot> Cork: Introduction - Material design - Google design guidelines → http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html
[00:41:58] <Cork> its the google design guidelines
[00:42:11] <Uhkis> material is pretty cool
[00:42:18] <Uhkis> just skip the animations
[00:42:19] <Cork> not a big fan my self
[00:42:32] <prohobo> cork what do you prefer?
[00:42:47] <Cork> the mid older designs
[00:42:55] <prohobo> mid older?
[00:42:56] <Cork> where things still have a little depth
[00:43:12] <Cork> prohobo: the design where you still used a little gradients
[00:43:18] <prohobo> ah ye
[00:43:18] <Mark_2> you mean like pre-yosemite design?
[00:43:19] <Cork> but not as much as when they went overboard
[00:43:26] <prohobo> im working on a site like that right now
[00:43:32] <prohobo> but im going to transform it into material
[00:43:38] <Mark_2> can we see?
[00:44:06] <Cork> my biggest problems with materials is buttons
[00:44:14] <Cork> there is no feel of pressure on them
[00:44:15] <prohobo> using this skin http://djangosuit.com/
[00:44:25] <prohobo> lots of gradients
[00:44:32] <prohobo> after about a week of use, it looks fugly
[00:44:49] <Cork> prohobo: ya, that is about what i like :)
[00:45:25] <Mark_2> that site is too old fashioned.
[00:46:00] <Mark_2> in fact, i have no idea how i should design my website
[00:46:18] <Mark_2> im also attempting to create something newer and freshier than facebook.
[00:46:24] <Cork> Mark_2: i'm a bit lucky i have a ui designer, so i don't have to care :)
[00:46:27] <Uhkis> https://material.angularjs.org/#/demo/material.components.button
[00:46:29] <Mark_2> im sure people are done with having a book with faces.
[00:46:35] <Mark_2> cool.
[00:46:42] <Uhkis> Cork: according to that, it's anti-pressure :D
[00:47:05] <Mark_2> Uhkis: thanks for the link. i think it’s pretty neat.
[00:47:18] <prohobo> i dont like those buttons
[00:47:20] <Cork> Uhkis: ya...
[00:47:21] <Mark_2> i’ve seen the ones that show submit progress.
[00:47:27] <prohobo> i like the style, but the buttons do suck
[00:47:28] <Cork> work well for mobile, sucks for desktop
[00:47:36] <Cork> or rather sucks for mouse
[00:47:38] <Uhkis> Mark_2: have some colors too http://www.materialpalette.com/
[00:50:19] <prohobo> about japanese websites
[00:50:41] <prohobo> japan is so progressive/trendy/modern
[00:50:46] <prohobo> but their websites suck
[00:50:49] <Mark_2> never seen japanses website.
[00:50:53] <prohobo> its just a mess
[00:50:57] <prohobo> 90% of the time
[00:55:46] <Uhkis> prohobo: examples?
[00:56:09] <prohobo> http://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/
[00:56:29] <Uhkis> my eyes :D
[00:57:01] <prohobo> exactly
[01:00:44] <Mark_2> i do’t think it’s that different
[01:01:09] <prohobo> i guess it's just the glyphs
[01:01:15] <prohobo> if that was all in english
[01:01:20] <prohobo> it'd look a lot cleaner
[01:03:05] <Uhkis> i wonder if they think the same
[01:18:24] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys, coming from java I wanted to introduce myself to brand new stuf,  and I drew a small application that I wanted to do in visual studio ,.,.  I've imagined it requireing HTML with JQuery and CSharp  ...  now I'm finding many guides and videos and tutorials on each subject.. but so far I can't find anything that couples this together...  Do you have any idea where I can look for videos or turtorials teaching me how to use C
[01:19:18] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: this is irc not a blog
[01:19:27] <Cork> don't write that long lines they get cut off
[01:19:53] <P3nnyw1se> Didn't get cutoff on my screen
[01:19:55] <Uhkis> lol
[01:20:08] <Cork> it isn't usually visible in the client
[01:20:23] <Cork> it might not have been cut of but you where very close to the limit
[01:20:26] <P3nnyw1se> in 'the' client? .. it was my impression there are several thousand different clients
[01:20:42] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: you usually only use one of them at a time
[01:20:56] <P3nnyw1se> correct, and you're saying my two lines hit the limit on all?
[01:20:58] <Cork> and the client doens't see the limitations the server apply
[01:21:10] <Cork> it wasn't a two line
[01:21:11] <P3nnyw1se> well I hope someone got the point anyways
[01:21:14] <Cork> it ended at "teaching me how to use C"
[01:21:20] <Cork> not sure if that was the end
[01:21:24] <P3nnyw1se> 4 more words
[01:21:24] <Uhkis> P3nnyw1se: it can easily be >4 lines on different sized client
[01:21:34] <P3nnyw1se> jesus
[01:21:38] <P3nnyw1se> alright... thx for your help
[01:25:32] <Tomasso> is there any method like .load that is supposed to refresh styles when loading content, in which instead of passing a url, I can pass the html code to render itself ?
[01:26:21] <Cork> Tomasso: you can't really refresh styles from ajax
[01:26:32] <Cork> unless the content has all the style inline
[01:26:40] <Cork> (in style="" or <style>)
[01:26:55] <Cork> Tomasso: ajax isn't meant to handle complete page replacements
[01:27:16] <Cork> you should do a normal window.location = new-location; in those cases
[01:34:06] <Tomasso> Cork: i tried everything .. .page() .triger('refresh').   .on('change',function(){})   .refresh()    hide and show again, etc..no luck.. no way works :S
[01:34:37] <Cork> Tomasso: uh
[01:34:40] <Tomasso> adding the style tag dinamycally on top of the page part..
[01:34:53] <Cork> did you read what i said at all?
[01:35:56] <Tomasso> Cork: yes.. I would need to copy all styles from a sample in which shows the styles to the dynamic content
[01:36:20] <Tomasso> i mean the style attribute value
[01:36:27] <Cork> Tomasso: no the <Cork> you should do a normal window.location = new-location; in those cases
[01:36:28] <Cork> part
[01:37:36] <Tomasso> so the document.ready runs again you mean?
[01:37:55] <Cork> no
[01:38:05] <Cork> i mean you should replace the entire document
[01:38:21] <Cork> style changes isn't something you should normally do in the same document
[01:38:34] <Cork> i mean style changes that need to remove the old style
[01:38:47] <Cork> style changes based on classes or similar is another thing
[01:39:17] <Tomasso> its based oo classes
[01:39:29] <Cork> then why do you need to replace the styles?
[01:41:32] <Tomasso> oh sorry.. i would need to replace the classes.. but even if i change the class.. doesnt load..
[01:46:35] <Uhkis> hmm, what's the equivalent of click event on firefox mobile, touchstart kinda sucks
[01:48:13] <faintful> Hey guys, got a question, I have a value like option[x], and have a few of them
[01:48:31] <faintful> I want to get them into a javascript object as string, what would be the best approach?
[01:49:34] <Uhkis> nvm, i guess i missclicked it :-)
[01:50:40] <Cork> faintful: you mean you would want to get the x as an array or what?
[01:51:23] <faintful> Cork: I want to have the options array, which is a php array in a form, to javascript format so I can send it over AJAX
[01:51:36] <faintful> Like, I have a form with options[name] etc
[01:51:46] <Cork> so you want to serialize a form?
[01:51:57] <Cork> ?api serializeArray
[01:51:58] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[01:52:00] <Cork> ?api serialize
[01:52:03] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[01:52:14] <faintful> Cork:I see, let me check that out!
[01:52:56] <hollusion> $('body').on('click', 'selector', function () { ... });
[01:53:23] <hollusion> will give all 'selector' elements that click function no matter when they get created
[01:53:49] <hollusion> is there a similar method for doing smth like "run this function whenever element xyz is created" ?
[01:54:28] <Uhkis> just add it to your creating function?
[01:55:04] <hollusion> i need it to behave like .on() so i can create global functions for specific selectors
[01:55:11] <hollusion> like $('body').on('click', 'selector', function () { ... }); does
[01:55:20] <Cork> hollusion: no it doens't
[01:55:37] <Cork> hollusion: $('body').on('click', 'selector') adds an event listener to body
[01:55:54] <Cork> and on bubbling click events checks if it has passed through an element matching 'selector'
[01:56:19] <hollusion> is there something similar with "create" instead of "click" ?
[01:56:24] <Cork> no
[01:56:49] <Cork> what exists is mutation observers
[01:56:57] <Cork> but it isn't cross browsers yet
[01:57:04] <Cork> ?mdn mutation observer
[01:57:04] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[01:57:45] <Cork> hollusion: the web compatible solution is to have the code adding the element notify the code that wants to know
[01:59:02] <hollusion> Cork: thank you very much
[02:14:12] <Erwat> hey when i create a div with document.createElement('div);
[02:14:27] <Erwat> var mydiv = document.createElement('div');
[02:14:34] <hollusion> $('body').on('mouseenter', '*[title]', function () { $(this).off('mouseenter') }); will the function and the listener fight against each other? or will the listener only apply the event for new element and only once?
[02:15:04] <hollusion> Erwat: why not create like: var div = $('<div>'); ?
[02:15:07] <Erwat> can i add a background in the following way to that div: mydiv.style = "background-image: blah.jpg;"; ?or do i have to do
[02:15:22] <Erwat> mydiv.style.backgroundImage = "blah.jpg";`? or what?
[02:15:36] <Erwat> hollusion: that isn't as readable for me for some reason
[02:15:49] <Erwat> like i didn't remember that one off the top of my head, i know you can use jquery somehow but i wasn't entirely sure
[02:16:03] <hollusion> var div = $('<div>'); div.css('backgroundImage', 'blah.jpg');
[02:16:22] <hollusion> use it 10 times and you will remember, its way faster to write it like that
[02:16:36] <Erwat> i've used it over 10 times
[02:16:39] <Erwat> i still can't remember
[02:16:58] <Erwat> but i use document.createElement more since i don't always have access to jquery
[02:17:15] <xec> hollusion: since you attached the handler to 'body' there is no event handler on $(this) and .off() shouldn't do anything, i expect
[02:18:12] <hollusion> xec: i see, is there a way to exclude $(this) from the listener?
[02:18:19] <xec> background-image in css requires a value in the format 'url("someurl")' iirc
[02:18:46] <xec> hollusion: you could store a flag with .data() and simply check if it's set
[02:20:04] <hollusion> xec: i was trying to do smth like $('body').on('mouseenter', '*[title]', function () { $(this).off('mouseenter'); $(this).someFancyPlugin(); });
[02:20:34] <hollusion> xec: to apply a plugin to $(this) on mouseenter, but only once
[02:20:55] <hollusion> ah... i get what you mean
[02:22:24] <hollusion> $('body').on('mouseenter', '*[title]:not(.flag)', function() { $(this).addClass('flag'); ... });
[02:22:33] <xec> no
[02:22:37] <xec> hollusion: http://jsfiddle.net/3tt3tsjg/
[02:23:02] <xec> but your way should work too
[02:23:20] <hollusion> yours looks better, will give it a shot
[02:25:56] <hollusion> Erwat: nowadays one should always have access to jquery
[02:26:35] <hollusion> if you use jquery you really should get acquainted to its syntax, it makes life much more easier
[02:27:45] <hollusion> $('selector') or $('<element>') is basic jquery
[02:27:52] <Erwat> i don't see how $('<div>'); makes it easier
[02:27:54] <Erwat> yes i know that
[02:27:57] <Erwat> but the div part
[02:28:40] <hollusion> you could do $('<div style="background-color:blue">');
[02:29:05] <hollusion> or $('<div>').css({"background-color":"blue"});
[02:29:24] <hollusion> it cant get much shorter than that
[02:29:48] <Cork> you could move the css into the stylesheat
[02:30:03] <Cork> then it would be $('<div class="the-class">')
[02:30:04] <hollusion> thats always the best of course :)
[02:30:38] <Cork> hollusion: it was a response to the "<hollusion> it cant get much shorter than that" :)
[02:32:51] <Erwat> oh, my issue was missing the url() around the url
[02:32:54] <Erwat> thanks
[02:33:10] <Erwat> forgot all about that
[02:38:12] <Mastema> I'm just starting to learn some basic ajax and was wondering where I can get the contents of data on the server side in php? I'm using $.ajax()
[02:38:45] <Cork> Mastema: depends on the type you use in the call
[02:39:10] <Cork> $_REQUEST will always have it $_POST for type: 'post' and $_GET for type: 'get
[02:39:12] <Mastema> Cork: atm I'm using html as the dataType
[02:39:22] <Cork> type, not dataType
[02:39:22] <Mastema> oh, I used Get
[02:39:42] <mooncup> then it will be in the $_GET array
[02:40:18] <mooncup> http://www.tizag.com/phpT/postget.php
[02:40:21] <Mastema> under what name? $_GET['data'] throws back my php script
[02:40:27] <hollusion> xec: works like a charm! thank you
[02:40:58] <Cork> Mastema: the key maps to the keys you give data
[02:41:17] <Cork> data: { key1: 'yes' } => $_GET['key1']
[02:41:29] <Mastema> Cork: I see, thanks.
[02:42:00] <hollusion> is .find('[data-labelfor]') the same as .find('*[data-labelfor]') ?
[02:42:02] <Cork> Mastema: or more specifically data converts an object to param
[02:42:18] <Cork> Mastema: or accepts an array of [{ name:, value: }]
[02:42:20] <Cork> or a param string
[02:42:45] <Cork> and the mapping is just default param mapping like from any normal form request server side
[02:48:58] <xec> hollusion: yes, the star is implied
[02:58:27] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm having a killer time trying to trigger an action by clicking on a particular button (more particularly an input object)
[02:59:06] <MajorWork> Why does my code work different if i have my javascript as an external resource/in the window on jsfiddle
[02:59:13] <neanderslob> I was wondering if anyone could take a look at my 5 lines of code to see if there's anything off: https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/cc39b75251a5ba8381eb
[03:00:00] <MajorWork> looks good to me
[03:00:13] <MajorWork> does it work? alert on click?
[03:00:23] <Cork> neanderslob: is the element loaded dynamically?
[03:00:30] <neanderslob> MajorWork: believe it or not, no
[03:00:38] <Cork> try $(document).on('click', '#submit_button' instead
[03:00:59] <neanderslob> Cork: hmm, will do
[03:01:44] <prohobo> that binds the element before it appears in the DOM
[03:02:09] <Cork> prohobo: no it calls from .ready
[03:02:22] <Cork> line 7
[03:02:24] <prohobo> you can check on initiate() if the element exists by calling: console.log($('#submit-button').length);
[03:02:46] <prohobo> oh
[03:03:07] <Cork> but ya, it is most likely that the element is added dynamically
[03:04:46] <neanderslob> Cork: wow, nicely done
[03:04:59] <Cork> i guess that worked :)
[03:05:37] <emocakes> i love cork
[03:05:38] <neanderslob> Cork: sure did, is there a quick explanation as to why dynamic loading requires one and not the other?
[03:05:58] <Cork> neanderslob: $('selector') looks in the dom for the element
[03:06:09] <Cork> .click/.on/.bind then adds an event handler to those elements
[03:06:17] <Cork> if the element doesn't exist yet
[03:06:21] <Cork> nothing can be bound
[03:06:22] <neanderslob> Cork: gotcha
[03:06:29] <Cork> document always exist
[03:06:32] <neanderslob> Cork: makes perfect sense
[03:06:45] <Cork> and then you give the selector to on to do a filtering on the bubbling event
[03:08:38] <neanderslob> Cork: hey, thanks a lot; you saved me from some considerable unpleasantness :-)
[03:23:10] <Tomasso> when it gets out from the .done function from a $.get request, it continues running a fire function in jquery source code, and goes to a line that says "self.disable()" , without returning any error.. and it doesnt continue running.. what could be wrong?
[03:34:24] <Erwat> at what point should i *not* use base64 for images?
[03:34:46] <Erwat> aret here some size limitations from which on it takes longer to decode the base64 than it would to have an additional request etc?
[03:35:03] <Erwat> currently we have all of the small images converted to base64 and put into a json file
[03:35:20] <Erwat> and you load the json file and then pull all the base64 images out from there
[03:35:59] <P3nnyw1se> just.. loosely .. how complicated is it if you are only familiar with java and a little HTML .. to do something like this with jquery?  -> http://postimg.org/image/5pzddoq05/
[03:37:09] <sacho_> 4 complicatons
[03:38:59] <mikeybisbo> I'm using jquery mobile to detect swiping on the body, but in some instances, I have divs on my page that I just want to scroll (horizontally) normally. Is there any way to disable the swipe detection on this div?
[03:41:01] <Omar-> mikecmpbll attach swipe listeners to page not body
[03:41:13] <mikecmpbll> Omar-: thanks, useful to know :p
[03:41:52] <Omar-> mikecmpbll also, if e.target == your div, return;
[03:41:55] <Omar-> for example
[03:42:03] <mikecmpbll> mikeybisbo: ^ you might be interested, too :)
[03:42:13] <mikeybisbo> yes sounds like it :-)
[03:42:24] <Omar-> lol mikecmpbll sorry
[03:42:29] <mikecmpbll> eheh.
[03:42:47] <Omar-> mikeybisbo that was meant for you
[03:43:31] <Omar-> mikeybisbo $(document).on("swipelef", ".ui-page-active", function (e) { if( $(e.target).hasClass("noSwipe") ) { return; } });
[03:47:45] <mikeybisbo> Hmm, for some reason returning undefined from the handler isn't letting the scroll events through
[03:48:40] <mikeybisbo> I simplified my quetion a little, I'm actually detecting scrollup and scrolldown (using a mobile jquery plugin I found to enable up and down as wellas left and right)
[03:49:28] <mikeybisbo> because I believe up and down is not supported by default in jquery mobile
[03:50:12] <Omar-> mikeybisbo true, up and down aren't supported by jQM
[03:50:49] <Omar-> mikeybisbo can you create a fiddle including sample of your page and the swipe plugin?
[03:51:07] <mikeybisbo> :-S There must be a way I can detect vertical swipes (preventing default action), but disabling that to allow certain divs to scroll themselves
[03:51:17] <mikeybisbo> Omar- sure okay I'll knock one up, many thanks
[03:51:35] <Omar-> mikeybisbo you're welcome :)
[03:56:56] <Mastema> Cork: it appears none of the functions are being called on the client side (success, error or complete) after the request has completed... web console says the request went through ok.... http://pastebin.com/ppaFUxVe
[04:11:49] <mikeybisbo> Omar- almost done!
[04:14:09] <mikeybisbo> Okay, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/zk967hrm/13/
[04:14:26] <mikeybisbo> I'm testing the touching using the Chrome's device mode
[04:17:31] <Omar-> mikeybisbo thanks, i'll check it out
[04:18:59] <mezod> is there any way to install only certain aprts of jquery-ui with bower? requiring jquery-ui makes my app need 5s to load !_!
[04:21:41] <mikeybisbo> Thank you! the other difficult part is that really I only want to disable the swipe if scrolling is possible inside that list. So if you are at the bottom of the list, I want to take over the next swipe (even if it's over the list) to change the page! Not sure if it's possible!
[04:33:10] <MajorWork> how does calling an empty function break my code?
[04:33:45] <pothepanda> its empty
[04:33:59] <MajorWork> but it stops a drop down from working correctly
[04:34:04] <MajorWork> and i can't fathom why that is
[04:34:32] <pothepanda> could you paste some code?
[04:34:55] <MajorWork> Yeah , I'm encountering more issues trying to make this test case than the orginal issue itself
[04:35:01] <MajorWork> http://jsfiddle.net/MajorTennis/zzLoanqs/4/
[04:35:16] <MajorWork> line 1849.1850,1851
[04:35:55] <MajorWork> i want to put 1849 + 1950 in the function called by 1851 but simply having the function empty or not just breaks a dropdown menu im focusing on
[04:37:39] <pothepanda> that is certainly a lot of code
[04:38:00] <MajorWork> I know everytime i try and trim it down it loses some fundamental functionality
[04:38:11] <Xatenev> Lol I thought the jquery IRC is dead, but it just didnt scroll down the messages
[04:38:15] <Xatenev> =o
[04:38:34] <MajorWork> its my nightmare i've been handed like 10,000+ lines of code that is only design orientated and i have to make some minute functionality
[04:38:55] <pothepanda> MajorWork: is it on 1849 you say ?
[04:38:58] <MajorWork> like all the drop downs work and look smoothly but I need to seperate them
[04:39:17] <MajorWork> 1849+1850 of the js work if uncommented but i want to put them in a function
[04:39:22] <TheoMurpse> Why doesn't this log a changed bit of HTML code? html = "<table><tr><td>test</td><td>Foo</td></tr></table>"; $.each($(html).find('td'),function(idx,td){$(td).text('howdy');}); console.log(html);
[04:39:39] <TheoMurpse> Shouldn't it be logging to the console <td>howdy</td>...<td>howdy</td>...?
[04:39:52] <Cork> TheoMurpse: you take the html, parse it to a dom
[04:39:56] <Cork> search the dom and modify it
[04:40:04] <Cork> then throw away the dom and log the original string
[04:40:07] <TheoMurpse> What do you mean, "parse it to a dom"
[04:40:14] <TheoMurpse> isn't that what $(html) does?
[04:40:17] <pothepanda> MajorWork:  1849 and 1850 is two curly braces to what i see
[04:40:20] <Cork> $() converts the string to a dom structure
[04:40:32] <TheoMurpse> Yes, and I'm doing that
[04:40:41] <TheoMurpse> ...$.each($(html)....
[04:40:44] <Cork> TheoMurpse: sure, but you never store it
[04:41:05] <Cork> you give the dom structure to $.each and loop it
[04:41:12] <TheoMurpse> Oh so instead var foo = $(html) and then instead of $(html).find it should be foo.find?
[04:41:12] <Cork> and after that it will just be lost
[04:41:18] <Cork> yes
[04:41:36] <Cork> and if you want the html again you would have to serialize the dom back to a string
[04:42:01] <TheoMurpse> Aewsome, thanks! Man, this was killing me for half an hour!
[04:42:14] <MajorWork> pothepanda, i'll some time fixing it , I feel exhibit asking for help on my test case so i can ask for help on my help
[04:42:14] <TheoMurpse> I was like, "I've done this a billion times, what's wrong with my logic?"
[04:43:12] <pothepanda> MajorWork: not sure i understand what you just said
[04:43:53] <MajorWork> dw I'll be back
[04:45:05] <kokut> Hello, I removed an element with .remove(); and now it doesnt seem to be getting the event changes or something
[04:45:20] <Cork> O_o
[04:45:28] <Cork> uh you removed it, how would it get anything?
[04:45:30] <denisbr> Hi people
[04:45:30] <kokut> sorry that sounded pretty dumb
[04:45:45] <kokut> i meant that i removed it and then appended it to its parent again
[04:46:06] <Cork> remove kills a lot of jquery internal references for the element
[04:46:11] <Cork> you shouldn't use that to move an element
[04:46:18] <Cork> just append it where you want it
[04:46:32] <kokut> well is there a "clear" or something i can use
[04:46:43] <kokut> i was using it for clearing its contents and reloading it
[04:46:44] <Cork> why would you need it?
[04:47:01] <Cork> just update its content/position
[04:47:15] <Cork> there is detatch if you really need to do that first
[04:47:21] <Cork> but normally you don't
[04:47:30] <kokut> how can i clear it
[04:47:33] <kokut> and fill it
[04:47:35] <kokut> its a list
[04:47:39] <Cork> uh
[04:47:48] <Cork> you "clear" it by giving it new content
[04:51:34] <denisbr> I have a field where is displayed an information about hours that a customer can use in the contract. The information is similar the HH:MM (Hour : Minute), but, the hour can have more that two digits (eg. 110:30, one hundred and ten hours and thirty minutes). How I do a mask it, when the user input be 12:30 (twelve hours and thirty minutes) not display 123:0.. ? Thanks a lot!
[04:52:34] <Cork> denisbr: uh why would it display 123:0?
[04:52:48] <Omar-> mikeybisbo chrome devtools touch isn't working well with scrollable list
[04:53:19] <mikeybisbo> Ah ok. I'm also testing on Chrome for iOS using the embedded result link
[04:53:57] <mikeybisbo> Omar- I have noticed a lot of diferences between the dev tool and the Chrome app, so really it's just the Chrome iOS app I'm concerned with
[04:54:34] <Omar-> mikeybisbo I just added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> to test it well
[04:54:49] <mikeybisbo> oh great, yes I forgot about that
[04:55:12] <denisbr> Cork: Because the mask is 000:00 then, I force the user a insert three digits before ":" and two digits after. if user enter with 12:30, the mask is 123:0 understand me?
[04:55:15] <Omar-> page scrolls still
[04:55:24] <Omar-> although I've disabled all custom JS
[04:55:28] <Cork> denisbr: not really
[04:55:34] <Omar-> listview isn't scrolling
[04:55:37] <Cork> how are you taking the input?
[04:56:00] <Omar-> mikeybisbo test this http://jsfiddle.net/xk91p9jq/ but js is disabled
[04:56:18] <Omar-> commented
[04:56:49] <denisbr> Cork: the user write the value at input
[04:56:56] <Cork> ok?
[04:57:14] <Cork> and somehow "12:30" gets convert to "123:0" by what?
[04:58:24] <Omar-> mikeybisbo I'll use jsbin, better than js fiddle
[04:58:38] <Omar-> btw, you told me you're using jQuery Mobile, right?
[04:58:41] <mikeybisbo> Omar- okay cool sounds good!
[04:58:44] <mikeybisbo> Yes that's right
[04:59:00] <denisbr> Cork: Because my mask is defined how "HHH:MM" (where the first digit is optional, but, if the user not enter with 0HH:MM, I have a problem)
[04:59:03] <mikeybisbo> and I think the up/down plugin is a plugin that requires jquery mobile
[04:59:12] <Cork> denisbr: define "mask"
[05:01:09] <Cork> denisbr: this is the only masking that is supporting natively http://jsfiddle.net/cbbarahn/
[05:01:31] <Cork> and i'm quite sure that isn't what you're using, so the question is; what ARE you using
[05:03:29] <Omar-> mikeybisbo fork this http://jsbin.com/hidanoraje/1/edit?html,js
[05:04:44] <mikeybisbo> Omar- done!
[05:04:58] <Cork> denisbr: something like this is what i would have done http://jsfiddle.net/cbbarahn/1/
[05:05:25] <Cork> opps wrong time types
[05:05:35] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cbbarahn/2/
[05:06:09] <Omar-> mikeybisbo iOS safari is working with my changes but not 100%
[05:06:25] <Omar-> iOS chrome not working
[05:06:34] <Omar-> i'll do some tests
[05:07:11] <Omar-> on your side, try $('#content').on('swipeup swipedown', ":not(ul), "not(li)", function (e) {
[05:07:20] <Omar-> $('#content').on('swipeup swipedown', ":not(ul), ":not(li)", function (e) {
[05:07:34] <Omar-> i'm not sure if this is correct, but Cork can tell us
[05:07:53] <Cork> ":not(ul), ":not(li)" looks really weird
[05:08:04] <Cork> the extra quite if nothing else
[05:08:24] <Cork> and it will match any element
[05:08:40] <Cork> (as it has to either not be an ul or not be an li == anything
[05:09:00] <Cork> is ":not(ul):not(li)" what you're looking for?
[05:11:04] <petzup> hy, need little help, have bug in my code, when i click on first title class="active" is removed and added to second, but if i click on same title, like on titl1 to toggle and again title1 to untoggle but nothings happens, so active class isn't removed.. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/f137er6w/
[05:11:43] <Cork> petzup: never ever add event handlers in a loop
[05:12:15] <mikeybisbo> Omar- Cork ':not(ul):not(li)' does sometimes work, but the touches are very temperamental. Occasioanlly you can get it to scroll the list, but mostly not :-(
[05:12:29] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/f137er6w/1/
[05:12:35] <petzup> fix it
[05:12:44] <petzup> i mean i remove each loop
[05:13:54] <Cork> petzup: secondly you first remove the active class for all elements
[05:13:59] <Cork> and then toggle one of them
[05:14:05] <Cork> the toggle will always be the same as addClass
[05:14:05] <petzup> yes
[05:15:16] <petzup> what should i use than?
[05:19:22] <Cork> petzup: is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/f137er6w/2/
[05:19:44] <petzup> Cork, yes exactly that!
[05:19:46] <petzup> tnx !
[05:19:56] <Cork> note '1000' is not a valid argument for .toggle
[05:20:03] <Cork> its 'slow' 'fast' or a number
[05:20:32] <denisbr> Cork: Sorry, I exited from my computer. I will see your links
[05:22:04] <petzup> a ok, tq
[05:23:02] <mikeybisbo> Omar- just popping out for 20 but ill be back. you having any luck?
[05:24:48] <MikeD_> from the slew of jquery datetime pickers, what's your favorite?
[05:29:00] <multi_io> how do you create a selector that selects two elements that you already have (in two variables)?
[05:29:18] <multi_io> $(elt1,elt2) only selects elt1 apparently.
[05:30:05] <Cork> multi_io: elt1.add(elt2)
[05:31:49] <multi_io> Cork: thanks, works
[05:48:03] <denisbr> Cork: this link http://jsfiddle.net/cbbarahn/2/ helped me !! Thanks a lot!!
[05:51:47] <Cork> denisbr: you prob forgot to hit save
[05:52:02] <Cork> cause that is the code i wrote
[05:54:18] <denisbr> Cork: then, I used your code at my project with any differences.
[05:56:17] <White_Cat> hi
[05:56:34] <multi_io> how do you append text to a text input?
[05:56:41] <multi_io> append() doesn't work.
[05:57:05] <Cork> $(this).val($(this).val() + newText)
[05:57:15] <multi_io> it only appends text to the HTML element, but doesn't add it to the widget...
[05:57:20] <Cork> append is for dom elements
[05:57:21] <multi_io> Cork: ok
[05:57:24] <Cork> not strings in an input field
[05:57:39] <multi_io> so there's no specialized append for that?
[05:58:44] <White_Cat> I am not very familiar with jquery, I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/z44egv2y/ and I want to externally add http://jsfiddle.net/umnj45gz/ to it
[05:59:12] <White_Cat> how can I do this?
[05:59:18] <Cork> White_Cat: don't use attr for state changes
[05:59:29] <Cork> use prop('disabled', true/false) for example
[05:59:49] <Joonaa> why does the else statement not fire even if there is no .sortList? http://pastebin.com/YfsmVBGL
[06:00:06] <Joonaa> wait... i think i might be retarded
[06:01:20] <multi_io> hm...
[06:01:34] <multi_io> actually I want to insert the text at the current cursor position
[06:01:42] * multi_io googles
[06:03:03] <Cork> multi_io: you would have to get the cursor position and concat the strings at that position
[06:03:09] <Cork> and then set the new string to the field
[06:06:36] <wiggl3> Omar-: would you happen to know what's wrong with this jQM scenario? http://jsfiddle.net/vpw3p8tw/
[06:06:48] <hrust> how to replace text to div without removing html elements
[06:06:57] <hrust> to = of
[06:07:42] <wiggl3> Omar-: fixed headers disappear when select is clicked
[06:12:32] <White_Cat> Cork I am unsure if that would work
[06:12:47] <White_Cat> the first code is from an odoo module which will be overwritten with an update
[06:12:54] <Omar-> wiggl3 let me check it
[06:13:01] <White_Cat> changing it would be fruitless
[06:13:05] <Cork> White_Cat: .attr('disabled' isn't cross browser
[06:13:09] <Cork> it WILL break
[06:13:12] <White_Cat> I am trying to add an aditional functionality to it
[06:13:35] <Cork> White_Cat: basically you should only ever use .attr if you explicitly need it
[06:13:46] <Cork> in all other cases you should use .prop
[06:14:02] <White_Cat> well, I cannot change the first code
[06:14:08] <White_Cat> I am tying to wtite mine
[06:14:23] <White_Cat> it doesnt have .attr
[06:14:55] <White_Cat> right?
[06:14:59] <Cork> uh, then make sure you don't go above jquery 1.5
[06:15:13] <White_Cat> sure :)
[06:15:14] <Cork> cause the first code isn't compatible with jquery 1.6+
[06:15:29] * sacho_ facepalm
[06:15:38] <White_Cat> my goal currently is to append this one function to the original code
[06:15:44] <wiggl3> Omar-: thx
[06:15:54] <Omar-> wiggl3 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L20-L21
[06:15:57] <Cork> White_Cat: well that means you have to write your code for 1.5 too
[06:16:05] <Cork> as prop doesn't exist in 1.5
[06:16:11] <White_Cat> sure
[06:16:12] <Omar-> you can override it by removing "select" from blacklist and hideDuringFocus
[06:16:16] <White_Cat> I already wrote my function
[06:16:26] <White_Cat> it works fine if I copy paste it inside the odoo code
[06:16:32] <White_Cat> I just want to keep it externa
[06:16:35] <White_Cat> *external
[06:16:49] <Cork> White_Cat: .on doesn't exist in 1.5
[06:17:03] <maxvi> when I do http://pastebin.com/VZaQywuY on iphone when I click on any button I have random field focused instead click function result, if I remove touchstart everything works fine.
[06:17:06] <White_Cat> this code works, I dont know its version
[06:17:23] <Cork> White_Cat: the second code requires 1.9+
[06:17:29] <Cork> the first code requires < 1.6
[06:17:35] <Cork> result == incompatible
[06:17:40] <White_Cat> really?
[06:17:42] <Cork> yes
[06:17:50] <Cork> the first code uses attr for properties
[06:17:50] <White_Cat> its a copy paste
[06:17:57] <Cork> and that doesn't work in 1.6+
[06:18:16] <Cork> you could replace .on with .delegate
[06:18:22] <Cork> it existed in 1.4.2
[06:18:29] <White_Cat> okay I am getting confused
[06:18:53] <Cork> White_Cat: the first code snippet is really old and you have to either use an old jquery version
[06:18:54] <Cork> or fix it
[06:19:03] <White_Cat> like I said
[06:19:06] <White_Cat> it is impossible to fix it
[06:19:10] <White_Cat> it will be overwritten
[06:19:13] <bobbobbins> hey, I’m using on change to update some hidden fields with the values from some text boxes, but when I update the fields, its always one change behind…so if I put in a 2, the hidden field will show 2, then if I change it to 3, it’ll stay the same, then I change it to 4, the hidden field becomes 3, 5 it becomes 4, etc…is that supposed to be how on change works? and if so, how can I make it not do that?
[06:19:15] <Cork> then you only have one option
[06:19:21] <White_Cat> I want to add a function to http://jsfiddle.net/z44egv2y/
[06:19:23] <Cork> and that is to use jquery 1.5
[06:19:30] <wiggl3> Omar-: is this necessary when i already have set data-tap-toggle="false"?
[06:19:36] <Cork> and .on doesn't exist in 1.5
[06:19:39] <Omar-> wiggl3 http://jsfiddle.net/gv0qa7ju/ use that code
[06:19:48] <White_Cat> the code I posted has .on in it
[06:19:52] <White_Cat> I dont understand the issue
[06:20:03] <Omar-> place it in head after jQuery.js (core) and before jQuery-Mobile.js
[06:20:05] <Cork> White_Cat: the second code requires 1.9
[06:20:10] <Cork> the first code requires < 1.6
[06:20:18] <Cork> it means they can't exist on the same page
[06:20:25] <Omar-> wiggl3 yes, it's by default unless you modify it on "mobileinit"
[06:20:27] <Cork> at least not without bugs
[06:20:34] <White_Cat> so what do I need to do?
[06:21:04] <Cork> if you absolutely can't fix the stone ages code snippet you have to relay on a stone age jquery version
[06:21:07] <Cork> meaning 1.5
[06:21:17] <Cork> so everything newer then that you have to avoid
[06:21:29] <Cork> and make sure you lost jquery 1.5 and not a newer one
[06:21:31] <wiggl3> Omar-: nice, thank you so much !!
[06:21:34] <White_Cat> I copy pcasted code from that ancient block and altered it sligtly
[06:21:36] <Cork> cause the code you have will break in 1.6+
[06:21:42] <Omar-> wiggl3 test it and let me know :)
[06:21:54] <White_Cat> it should be compatible with each other in that sense
[06:21:59] <Cork> White_Cat: if you run that code in production with jquery newer then 1.5 the site is broken
[06:22:11] <White_Cat> like I asked
[06:22:12] <wiggl3> Omar-: why is this behavior here in the first place, will it be removed in future versions?
[06:22:13] <Cork> attr for disabled isn't compatible
[06:22:13] <White_Cat> what do I need to do
[06:22:17] <White_Cat> I dont understand it
[06:22:19] <wiggl3> Omar-: it seems a little bit.. silly kinda :p
[06:22:31] <Cork> White_Cat: look in the page and make sure you use jquery 1.5
[06:22:38] <Cork> if you don't == you have a broken site
[06:22:40] <White_Cat> telling me that it isnt compatible or mentioning version numbers does not help me the slightest
[06:22:44] <Omar-> wiggl3 i'm not sure if the team would remove it
[06:22:52] <Cork> only way to use a newer version is to rewrite the first fiddle
[06:23:03] <Cork> cause it REQUIRES behaviors changed in 1.6
[06:23:10] <Omar-> wiggl3 but its meant to leave more working space for user when input elements are focused
[06:23:11] <White_Cat> I explained you 3 times already. I cannot modify the code.
[06:23:12] <krambiorix> i want to hide "HIDE" but it's not working , see http://jsfiddle.net/1z39spms/
[06:23:15] <Cork> so if you go past 1.6 it is broken
[06:23:18] <sacho_> sucks to be you then
[06:23:20] <Omar-> wiggl3 think about the bright side :P
[06:23:34] <White_Cat> All I want to do is externally add a function to the original code
[06:23:42] <White_Cat> I am merely asking you how to do this. :/
[06:23:46] <Cork> White_Cat: and i said, make sure you write for 1.5
[06:23:52] <Cork> and that means don't use .on
[06:23:56] <Cork> use .delegate
[06:24:15] <White_Cat> $(oe_website_sale).delegate('change', ".oe_cart input.js_cust_ref", function () {
[06:24:19] <White_Cat> thats the only change?
[06:24:22] <Cork> yes
[06:24:32] <Cork> basically make sure to run the code with a 1.5 lib
[06:24:38] <Cork> and check the error console
[06:24:44] <White_Cat> I lack a console of any kind
[06:24:53] <White_Cat> code is interpreted and run within odoo
[06:24:59] <White_Cat> its quite painful to work with
[06:25:23] <Cork> White_Cat: this is the newest version of jquery you can write for http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.2.js
[06:25:24] <White_Cat> since informaiton comes from pyton to xml to jquery back to python then outputted to xml
[06:25:34] <Cork> make sure the new code works with that lib
[06:26:03] <rethus> why does this late loading of "prettyPhoto.js" not work? http://jsfiddle.net/wbr3a4ud/3/
[06:26:26] <rethus> have I to do additional things to make js load the external content after adding it to DOM?
[06:26:28] <MajorWork> can I put an onclick event on a li?
[06:26:35] <wiggl3> Omar-: yeah that makes sense..
[06:26:41] <wiggl3> Omar-: thanks again :)
[06:26:42] <Cork> MajorWork: you can put a click event on anything
[06:26:57] <Cork> MajorWork: don't use event attributes though
[06:27:03] <White_Cat> code is still doing absolutely nothing cork
[06:27:07] <MajorWork> Everything the light touches is clickable
[06:27:19] <BillCriswell> rethus: Why are you doing it like this?
[06:27:35] <Cork> White_Cat: do you have the fiddle again
[06:27:41] <BillCriswell> rethus: If you'e just looking for a quick answer though you can get $.getScript
[06:27:52] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[06:27:54] <rethus> It is part of a CMS-Module, which is loaded in some special circumstances
[06:27:58] <White_Cat> I have fiddle there, but it wont run as it doesnt have python components
[06:28:01] <BillCriswell> rethus: Ah ok.
[06:28:12] <MajorWork> so no change to the HTML but put a click event in the javascript ,cork? Thing is they don't have unique ID's the designers given every dropdown on the page the same class
[06:28:24] <BillCriswell> getScript should do the trick, basically $.getScript('foo.js', function () { $('.whatever').foo(); });
[06:28:34] <White_Cat> http://jsfiddle.net/z44egv2y/ http://jsfiddle.net/umnj45gz/2/
[06:28:35] <Cork> MajorWork: if you want it on multiple elements delegate it to a common parent
[06:28:42] <rethus> BillCriswell: nice, and this getScript automaticly add it to the dom ?
[06:29:01] <MajorWork> Ok cheers
[06:29:03] <White_Cat> Cork how do you add a function to an existing jquery file externally?
[06:29:05] <BillCriswell> rethus: Not sure it needs to actually add it, but it's available to use.
[06:29:06] <Omar-> wiggl3 you're welcome :)
[06:29:32] <Cork> White_Cat: deferred doesn't exist in 1.5
[06:29:33] <BillCriswell> rethus: I'd try it and see.
[06:29:37] <Cork> so you can't use that
[06:30:07] <Cork> (line 13)
[06:30:26] <Omar-> mikeybisbo i got an idea. disable swipe events on "touchstart" of "scroller" and enable them "touchend"
[06:30:47] <White_Cat> cork I dont see it mentioned
[06:30:58] <Cork> .then(function (data) { <--
[06:31:07] <White_Cat> this code works
[06:31:11] <Cork> unless .then is something "openerp" implements
[06:31:18] <Cork> you can't use it with the first code
[06:31:27] <White_Cat> the first code definately works
[06:31:32] <White_Cat> its running right now
[06:31:36] <Cork> it might not show the bugs to you
[06:31:40] <White_Cat> how or why, what version its running on I dont know
[06:31:41] <Cork> but it is definitely buggy
[06:31:49] <White_Cat> its odoos original funciton
[06:31:50] <Cork> cause you can't toggle disabled with attr
[06:31:53] <Cork> or readonly
[06:31:58] <Cork> it isn't cross browser
[06:32:10] <Cork> it only sets the attribute value
[06:32:21] <White_Cat> I dont care if isnt cross browser since its not my code and I cannot influence it
[06:32:24] <Cork> it doesn't actually tells the browser "make this field readonly/disabled"
[06:32:29] <White_Cat> all i care is adding my function to it
[06:33:08] <Cork> so you give us a pile of sticks and wonder why it isn't a working car?
[06:33:16] <White_Cat> not really
[06:33:26] <White_Cat> all I am asking is how to add a function to the original function
[06:33:34] <rethus> BillCriswell:  http://jsfiddle.net/wbr3a4ud/4/ still not work
[06:33:41] <Cork> i'll answer that, cause you don't care about the bugs in the code
[06:33:44] <Cork> so it just builds up
[06:33:53] <White_Cat> Its not my code
[06:33:56] <White_Cat> do you get this?
[06:33:59] <Cork> so you don't have to care?
[06:34:14] <White_Cat> it will be overwritten next time I update the module weather I like it or not
[06:34:31] <White_Cat> therefore I am not worried about its well being for the itme being
[06:34:44] <White_Cat> once I get my funciton working with it I can then worry about this stuff
[06:34:56] <Cork> White_Cat: the code has clear and quite big compatibility bugs
[06:35:00] <BillCriswell> rethus: You didn't use it like I showed you, or how the docs would have showed you.
[06:35:13] <Cork> asking us to debug code we can't trust is... at least not something i will put down time into
[06:35:23] <White_Cat> so you are saying code I coppied from and slightly altered isnt compatible?
[06:35:29] <rethus> Sorry I missed ... where have you shown?
[06:35:37] <White_Cat> I copied and modified $(oe_website_sale).on("change", ".oe_cart input.js_quantity", function () {
[06:35:39] <Cork> White_Cat: i'm saying the code is broken
[06:35:44] <Cork> fundamentally broken
[06:35:45] <BillCriswell> rethus: getScript should do the trick, basically $.getScript('foo.js', function () { $('.whatever').foo(); });
[06:36:05] <White_Cat> Cork except its working.
[06:36:44] <rethus> BillCriswell: so all code which is need to act on this external file have to bi inside of the getScript-function() ?
[06:37:10] <BillCriswell> rethus: Yes, that function calls when getScript has loaded the JS file. There's no way to know it's loaded without that callback.
[06:37:25] <mikeybisbo> Omar- I think I've done it! http://jsbin.com/fedicoruhu/1/edit?js,output
[06:38:19] <rethus> BillCriswell: please have a look at my fillde... There is a event-catch for rel='prettyPhoto'-Click. So I can't use it, cause it has to initialize thes links ?
[06:38:21] <FilipNortic> White_Cat: He's basicly saying you seem to have a black box and you're trying to append functionality to it, Then asking us why it isn't compatible is a little strange
[06:38:33] <mikeybisbo> Omar- similar to what you mentioned, basically detecting touches myself on the list and if the list is not at the end of it's scroll in that direction then just cancel all events
[06:38:37] <mikeybisbo> Omar- thoughts?
[06:38:48] <Omar-> mikeybisbo this works well in iphone 5 safari
[06:38:50] <Omar-> well done
[06:38:52] <White_Cat> FilipNortic its a balck box to me as well
[06:39:06] <White_Cat> All I want to know is how does one add a function to a .js file externally
[06:39:10] <BillCriswell> rethus: I don't understand.
[06:39:30] <mikeybisbo> Omar- thanks, more by luck than judgement though!
[06:39:33] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/wbr3a4ud/5/
[06:39:38] <mikeybisbo> Omar- not sure if there's a more elegant way to do it
[06:39:40] <rethus> ok. this way, it seems to work
[06:39:50] <sacho_> White_Cat, you can't add a function to a js file externally
[06:39:52] <BillCriswell> rethus: The way I showed you twice? :)
[06:39:56] <Omar-> mikeybisbo to find out if scrollable div has reached the end, use "scrollstop" event
[06:40:21] <rethus> BillCriswell: thanks. Someone are faster than others ;)
[06:40:28] <Omar-> mikeybisbo then compate div's height to div's .scrollTop()
[06:40:29] <BillCriswell> rethus: Haha glad you got it working.
[06:40:35] <FilipNortic> White_Cat: add a function without editing the file?
[06:40:42] <White_Cat> yeah
[06:40:48] <White_Cat> since the file will be overwritten
[06:40:48] <Omar-> if they're equal, then it means you've reach the end of scrollable div
[06:40:52] <Omar-> compare*
[06:41:43] <White_Cat> in python, c#, c++ I am familiar with inheriting and adding/modifying functions
[06:41:54] <White_Cat> I imagined jquery had this too
[06:42:50] <mikeybisbo> Omar- okay, would the implementation be cleaner with that event listener?
[06:42:56] <mikeybisbo> Omar- just trying to think how I could work it in
[06:43:10] <FilipNortic> White_Cat: not really, there isthe  prototype methods but that is the closest you get
[06:43:48] <FilipNortic> an jQuery plugins depending on what you are trying to do
[06:46:09] <FilipNortic> White_Cat: But what cork was trying to tell you was that if you test the code with jQuery 1.11 and it turns out your enviorment runs jQury 1.5 we can't promise that i'll work
[06:46:10] <wiggl3> Omar-: wait so i can understand why it would tap toggle but why is it still doing it when i set data-tap-toggle="false"?
[06:46:24] <White_Cat> FilipNortic hmm
[06:46:31] <White_Cat> I am unsure how to check for version :/
[06:46:33] <Cork> FilipNortic: it is more then that
[06:46:46] <Cork> the code he posted will be broken in 1.6+
[06:46:56] <Cork> it isn't hypothetical
[06:47:10] <FilipNortic> Cork: I know i was trying to simplify to be clear seemed like the way to go
[06:47:31] <White_Cat> Cork the (longer) code works for sure, I dont know its version
[06:47:54] <Cork> White_Cat: it might work in the explicit browser you view it in
[06:47:56] <Cork> but it is broken
[06:50:02] <wiggl3> Omar-: got it working: http://jsbin.com/rusupaxine/1/edit?html,output
[06:50:53] <Omar-> wiggl3 tap toggle is meant to work on any element not only blacklisted ones
[06:51:12] <Omar-> so if you remove it and tap on content div the header will hide
[06:51:33] <Omar-> mikeybisbo which event listener? scrollstop?
[06:51:41] <mikeybisbo> Omar- yes
[06:51:56] <mikeybisbo> Omar- would that be used to set a flag we can then check on touchmove?
[06:52:34] <wiggl3> Omar-: sorry im a little bit confused. anyway seems like `hideDuringFocus: ""` alone is enough: http://jsbin.com/rusupaxine/2/edit
[06:52:42] <Omar-> mikeybisbo http://jsbin.com/howecezawu/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:53:10] <Omar-> mikeybisbo yes it's possible, but scollstop triggers when scroll stops
[06:53:49] <Omar-> wiggl3 could be enough. to be honest, never touched toolbar settings before ;)
[06:53:56] <wiggl3> :D
[06:54:22] <Omar-> wiggl3 but now, when input or textarea are focused, header won;t hide
[06:54:52] <Omar-> hideDuringFocus: "elements you want to hide header when focused"
[06:55:07] <Omar-> can be tag name, id or class
[06:55:13] <wiggl3> Omar-: seems i can do `data-hide-during-focus=""` as well
[06:55:22] <wiggl3> i dont think i want it to hide evar :P
[06:55:29] <Omar-> hideDuringFocus: ".foo, #bar, ul" for example
[06:55:54] <Omar-> wiggl3 yea? good one ;)
[06:58:17] <wiggl3> this is so cool Omar- thank you so much
[06:58:39] <Omar-> wiggl3 anytime! :)
[06:58:56] <wiggl3> :)
[06:59:13] <Omar-> if you've more questions regarding jQM let me know!
[06:59:21] <Omar-> i'm bored ever since I left SO
[06:59:21] * wiggl3 puts on some arab rap (Salah Edin - Horr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBoKu13-hQ)
[06:59:25] <wiggl3> oh for sure
[06:59:48] <Omar-> Arab rap? hahaha. I prefer classic Arabic songs ;)
[06:59:55] <wiggl3> you could probably have made the coolest jQM app ever if you hadn't been too busy helping other people :)
[07:00:09] <BillCriswell> Omar-: The race to answer the same question was getting old?
[07:00:26] <Omar-> wiggl3 I wish I could, I lack experience in web development
[07:00:34] <wiggl3> ooh man, classic arabic songs are great. i dont understand arabic but i have a lot of old tape cassettes and vinyls with them and there's hardly any other genre i find more relaxing and meditative..
[07:01:36] <wiggl3> Omar-: what about http://kickass.to/lynda-ruby-on-rails-4-essential-training-t9131402.html ?
[07:01:42] <Omar-> BillCriswell: you mean trivial and repetitve questions :P
[07:02:05] <wiggl3> lynda is a good girl
[07:02:08] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Haha
[07:02:37] <Omar-> wiggl3 lol..to be honest, web development isnt my field. jQM/coding is just a hobby
[07:02:45] <Omar-> i'm not developer ;)
[07:02:55] <Omar-> BillCriswell it's sad, isn;t?
[07:04:13] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Yeah it's rough. At this point it's mostly just users who are too lazy to google.
[07:05:14] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: easy way out
[07:05:40] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Hm?
[07:06:28] <wiggl3> Omar-: is that some kind of arab humbleness thing, i don't get it. it's like being a racecar engineer but saying "no, i don't drive..."
[07:06:52] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: its purely incompetence and not having the initiative to search stuff by one's self
[07:07:06] <wa5ted> i get too many how do i d this questions when there is a volume of inforrmation online
[07:07:39] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I guess that's fair. It does take more effort to ask the question on SO than google it.
[07:08:01] <wiggl3> Omar-: i have to go but i'll see you around :)
[07:08:31] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: i can understand if you are asking a peer and yu are trying to map uncharted territory
[07:08:46] <prohobo> jquery happens to have a lot of noobs asking noob questions on the internet, so resources are plentiful
[07:09:09] <prohobo> seems like i can ask the most weird contrived questions about jquery/js on google and SOMEONE will have asked the same question at some point
[07:09:24] <prohobo> CSS as well because people hate CSS
[07:09:48] <mikeybisbo> Omar- thanks for all your help buddy, you're awesome
[07:09:48] <prohobo> and because CSS is annoying as hell
[07:09:51] <BillCriswell> prohobo: Haha true
[07:09:57] <BillCriswell> I love css.
[07:10:09] <prohobo> i like it when it works
[07:10:14] <Cork> not sure why ppl hate css to much
[07:10:22] <prohobo> because it's too confusing
[07:10:31] <Xatenev> prohobo: confusing? :D
[07:10:32] <Cork> what's so confusing about it?
[07:10:37] <BillCriswell> I never found it confusing.
[07:10:50] <prohobo> divs inside divs
[07:10:53] <prohobo> always act retarded
[07:10:55] <BillCriswell> I can find it annoying at times, if I'm working with bad css, but when it's good css I rarely run into issues.
[07:11:14] <Cork> prohobo: not sure what you're thinking about there
[07:11:15] <davesleep> anyone here use jquery bbq? and know why /#post?post_id=10&post_name=blah returns 'post?post_id' = '10'
[07:11:25] <davesleep> in an object using $.deparam.fragment();
[07:11:35] <davesleep> as opposed to 'post_id'='10'
[07:11:44] <Xatenev> Cork: +1
[07:12:02] <davesleep> the thing is, i am using jqueryBBQ for history, but, i could do it manually but i figure i should use it, but i'm leaning towards parsing the query manually
[07:12:14] <davesleep> so many buts
[07:12:18] <Cork> the one thing that has always annoyed me with css is that vertical-align doesn't work outside tables
[07:12:29] <Cork> though later i learned there is a really good reason for that
[07:12:41] <Cork> (and why you should avoid tables for the same reason)
[07:12:53] <prohobo> Cork: okay here's a simple example: how do you hide the overflow of an inner div (say there's padding) while applying a scrollbar to the outer div to scroll the inner div's contents
[07:13:04] <prohobo> i figured it out
[07:13:08] <prohobo> but it was annoying as shit
[07:13:12] <Cork> it is?
[07:13:18] <gtristan> Cork, doesnt it work with display:table ?
[07:13:27] <gtristan> the vertical-align I mean
[07:13:30] <Cork> prohobo: you put position absolute on the inner
[07:13:34] <Cork> align it with the outer
[07:13:51] <Cork> prohobo: wait a min reading that again
[07:13:53] <prohobo> what does that do?
[07:14:03] <Cork> you want one divs scroll bars to scroll the content of another??
[07:14:04] <prohobo> ill show you what i mean Cork
[07:14:06] <Cork> you can't do that with css
[07:14:08] <prohobo> yep
[07:14:24] <Cork> its like wanting the scroll bar of one page to scroll the page of another tab
[07:14:30] <Cork> they aren't related
[07:14:59] <Omar-> wiggl3 lol, it's something like that. but this is the truth :)
[07:15:52] <Omar-> BillCriswell the mods want a nice and friendly enviornment. by this, they allow low quality content.
[07:16:01] <Omar-> mikeybisbo thanks! it's a pleasure :)
[07:16:24] <Omar-> BillCriswell https://expertflow.wordpress.com/
[07:16:48] <prohobo> well Cork i wasnt really able to do it
[07:16:50] <prohobo> but close enough
[07:16:56] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/p4agymb2/
[07:18:18] <Cork> prohobo: sounds like what you want is the overflow-clip-box
[07:18:25] <Cork> though it isn't standardized yet
[07:18:26] <prohobo> omg what?
[07:18:29] <prohobo> oh
[07:18:44] <prohobo> and thats why i hate CSS
[07:18:46] <BillCriswell> I'm confused. What's this doing that's difficult?
[07:18:46] <Cork> overflow-clip-box was developed to explain how textarea works
[07:18:46] <prohobo> brb
[07:19:28] <Cork> prohobo: css is stabilizing and straighten up old rules that couldn't be explained in css
[07:19:37] <Cork> and it solved much of these
[07:19:45] <Cork> css4 has a lot of weird new properties :)
[07:19:52] <Cork> like display-inner and display-outer
[07:19:57] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Haha good reads so far.
[07:20:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ooo that sounds promising.
[07:20:17] <Cork> it does
[07:20:37] <BillCriswell> I always wanted a pseudo ::inner and ::outer type element to avoid <div class="container"></div> all over the place.
[07:20:43] <Cork> the one thing i think they have a hard time explaining in css without causing performance regression is <br>
[07:21:30] <gtristan> lol, just what we need, *more* CSS properties, so the possible combinations of elements/properties/browsers just grows exponentially
[07:21:48] <gtristan> what could be more reliable ;-)
[07:21:56] <Cork> gtristan: the new properties is to stabelize the platform
[07:22:13] <Cork> it isn't the old prefix everything type of solution
[07:22:28] <BillCriswell> Thankfully haha
[07:22:29] <Cork> and things are finnaly landing in css again
[07:22:40] <Cork> flex for example is close to cross browser now
[07:22:52] <gtristan> yeah, flexbox looks nice
[07:22:53] <Cork> grid is close behind
[07:23:10] <Cork> filter is close to landing too
[07:23:21] <Cork> and there is css variables
[07:23:40] <Cork> (it has already landed)
[07:23:45] <gtristan> but one would really have to break API, drop all the old and deprecated garbage - start fresh, to get a comprehensive/stable dev experience :)
[07:24:02] <BillCriswell> still cofnused me variables weren't available from the get go.
[07:24:05] <Cork> gtristan: the web doesn't really work like that
[07:24:15] <gtristan> once every 20 years, can be acceptable right ?
[07:24:15] <Cork> they create new properties and deprecate the old ones if needed
[07:24:27] <gtristan> Cork, I know, that's so sad, reality bites
[07:24:28] <Cork> they never actually remove support, you can't really do that on the web
[07:24:45] <Cork> gtristan: what is sad is when browsers can't fix bugs cause too many sites depend on it
[07:25:04] <Cork> like that webkit gives the wrong size if you ask for the content area :/
[07:25:37] <Cork> blink landed a fix they had to backout about a month ago cause the web broke if webkit gave the correct value >_<
[07:26:10] <xec> so funny. yet so sad
[07:26:22] <gtristan> I experimented with building distro agnostic linux binaries for a while... and recently got to thinking... what if one could do something similar for the browser ?
[07:26:35] <Cork> and that we still don't have let
[07:26:52] <BillCriswell> Paul Irish was saying there's a significant performance improvement they could do if they could make overflow: hidden; behave as it's supposed to, but they can't.
[07:26:55] <Cork> cause sites use it as variable names even though it has been a reserved name for the last 18 years
[07:27:03] <gtristan> like... hey... take an extra few MB download first time you connect to my site... download the 'browser support', I'm just gonna run exactly the same on every browser, kinda thing
[07:27:05] <Cork> sigh...
[07:27:21] <xec> BillCriswell: really? that's insane
[07:27:42] <BillCriswell> xec: Yeah, in some cases you can render content outside of overflow: hidden, even though you shouldn't be able to.
[07:32:50] <prohobo> flex is still a thing?
[07:32:53] <prohobo> i thought flash was dead
[07:33:11] <xec> not sure if trolling...
[07:33:40] <prohobo> doesnt flex run in the flash sandbox?
[07:33:54] <simion314> flex is still around, is an apache project and it is still  getting new updates
[07:34:18] <xec> prohobo: sorry, didnt realy flex is some adobe thing. we're talking about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex
[07:34:22] <xec> realize*
[07:34:35] <prohobo> ooh
[07:34:37] <prohobo> okay
[07:34:41] <prohobo> a different thing called flex
[07:34:44] <prohobo> interesting
[07:34:58] <xec> previously known as flexbox
[07:35:10] <simion314> anyone has any idea why an hidden element could grab my click and become focused,?
[07:35:25] <prohobo> lol
[07:39:54] <xec> simion314: depends on how it's "hidden" i guess. like opacity 0 is still clickable. unsure about visibility: hidden;
[07:53:00] <davesleep> anyone here use jquery BBQ and know how to get $.deparam.fragment to work after the first ? and not the #
[07:53:42] <davesleep> oh god
[07:53:45] <davesleep> i got it working d'oh
[07:54:14] <davesleep> finally
[08:01:10] <_DB> im wondering can I change a data attribute on all the <li>'s in a div usings its id?
[08:01:55] <_DB> $('#idhere :li').attr('data-id',2)?
[08:05:23] <t4nk262> Hi all, need a little help.
[08:05:46] <t4nk262> I have a Jquery script that runs on a button click, works fine. But when I refresh the page it doesnt work untill I clear the cache. Then works fine.
[08:05:49] <t4nk262> Any ideas?
[08:08:00] <jphase> _DB: $('#idhere li').data('id', 2);
[08:08:42] <_DB> cool
[08:08:45] <_DB> thanks
[08:08:46] <jphase> unless you specifically need to set the attribute for some reason, then you'd use my selector with your .attr method
[08:08:48] <jphase> np
[08:09:21] <jphase> t4nk262: sounds like your browser is just caching the old script, nothing to do with the code itself
[08:11:10] <_DB> heh I actually had to use the other one
[08:11:20] <_DB> because the data wasnt set
[08:11:44] <_DB> it had no initial value so I used attr (that correct?)
[08:15:00] <jphase> _DB: you can do that, or you can just set an initial value
[08:15:12] <_DB> I see
[08:15:13] <_DB> ok
[08:15:26] <_DB> I thought it might work if I did that didnt try it though
[08:16:02] <jphase> I tend to use .data whenever I deal with data attributes and use PHP or w/e scripting language you use to set data-id="yourdefault" so .data can retrieve the value as well
[08:16:22] <jphase> to each his/her own
[08:28:10] <t4nk820> Anyone any idea why onced jquery is cached it wont work?
[08:30:23] <Cork> t4nk820: sounds like a race condition
[08:30:44] <Cork> that something needs the load time to have the time to do what it needs to do
[08:33:01] <_DB> how can I append a divs children to another div?
[08:33:24] <_DB> I dont feel like having another container div around it
[08:33:36] <_DB> (even though its the easier choice lol)
[08:34:37] <NoiseEee> _DB: use detach() and appendTo()
[08:34:43] <Cork> _DB: $(other).append($(this).children())
[08:34:48] <Cork> no need for detach
[08:34:57] <NoiseEee> beauty Cork
[08:35:11] <_DB> alright cool thanks guys!
[08:36:42] <Omar-> how to selects by data-attribute
[08:36:47] <Omar-> select*
[08:37:10] <Omar-> for example <div data-foo="1"></div> <div data-foo="2"></div>
[08:37:11] <Cork> Omar-: [data-]
[08:37:25] <Cork> but remember it only works for attributes
[08:37:30] <Omar-> Cork $("[data-foo]") ?
[08:37:34] <Cork> things you've set with .data() doesn't work
[08:37:35] <Cork> yes
[08:37:53] <Omar-> yes, attributes not .data()
[08:38:35] <Omar-> Cork you rock!
[08:38:51] <Omar-> i dont know why I always though that data- should have a value
[08:39:16] <Omar-> like data-foo="bar" so the selector $("[data-foo=bar]")
[08:39:52] <Cork> always quote the values
[08:40:04] <Cork> $('[data-foo="bar"]')
[08:43:31] <Omar-> Cork it works without. is it necessary?
[08:43:58] <Cork> Omar-: its a very good habit to always do
[08:44:14] <Cork> cause the day the value contains space or [ or ]
[08:44:39] <Cork> so just always do it and you won't have to scratch your head wondering why you get cryptic regexp errors from jquery
[08:44:53] <Omar-> Cork you're right
[08:45:01] <Omar-> and wise ;)
[08:45:10] <Omar-> lol true
[08:46:40] <maddtechwf> I just added jQuery Validation to my form.  I'm having an issue though.  When I get to the point of answering Yes or No, I need another field to show up if 'Yes' is checked and hide if no is submited.  Can anyone help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/ypf3s234/
[08:48:48] <Omar-> maddtechwf var benefits = $("#otherBenefitsYes");
[08:52:37] <maddtechwf> I changed that but it still doesn't show the textarea Omar
[08:53:39] <Omar-> maddtechwf because there is an error with "inital" var
[08:53:50] <Omar-> and you didn't define "hide" class in CSS
[08:53:58] <Omar-> .hide { display:none; }
[09:00:16] <maddtechwf> Omar- I added the css.  What is wrong with my inital var?
[09:00:53] <Omar-> maddtechwf http://jsfiddle.net/pr10ja2r/
[09:03:55] <maddtechwf> Thanks Omar- .  Will the fact that the textarea is required affect anything?
[09:06:09] <Omar-> maddtechwf you mean validation? it works
[09:06:57] <maddtechwf> Awesome Omar- .  You rock.
[09:22:17] <Omar-> maddtechwf you're welcome!
[09:24:24] <morfin> how do you think is that weird idea to use own Promises library with jQuery?
[09:24:31] <morfin> "own"
[09:24:37] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[09:24:45] <robertmaxrees> why are you using your own?
[09:25:04] <morfin> because i like how it works with promises
[09:25:16] <robertmaxrees> err.
[09:25:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery has its down promises system.
[09:26:05] <morfin> maybe heard about Bluebird?
[09:26:59] <robertmaxrees> doesn't support IE8 without some munging.
[09:27:58] <robertmaxrees> i guess if you wnat to use something else, that's cool, but i don't really see the need personally.  jquery already has a promises system that'll be standards compliant soon enough, so i guess i don't see the benefit.
[09:28:54] <morfin> what about IE8?
[09:29:03] <robertmaxrees> Bluebird doesn't support it.
[09:29:11] <morfin> that crap does not support anything
[09:29:12] <robertmaxrees> it "sort of" does
[09:29:40] <morfin> i hope soon all that IE7-8 will die
[09:29:50] <robertmaxrees> meh.
[09:29:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't really care all that much.
[09:29:57] <morfin> and finally will be buried with IE 6
[09:30:06] <morfin> our clients are using that cra[p
[09:30:11] <robertmaxrees> FF 3.6 sucks by todays standards, too.
[09:30:22] <robertmaxrees> don't get mad at the browser, get mad at the orgs insisting that they use it.
[09:30:57] <morfin> when those crappy browser will die orgs will be forced to update
[09:31:12] <robertmaxrees> except those browser can only die when orgs start updating.
[09:31:25] <morfin> they will
[09:31:32] <robertmaxrees> meanwhile, big whoop.  programming is hard sometimes.
[09:31:43] <morfin> because otherwise no updates, no security
[09:31:50] <morfin> "security"
[09:32:01] <robertmaxrees> up to the orgs.
[09:32:49] <morfin> hmm IE7-8 is XP
[09:33:30] <morfin> and maybe 8 was on Vista too(but who use that shit)
[09:34:14] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people ;)
[09:34:32] <morfin> they should die
[09:34:39] <morfin> and suffer before that
[09:34:44] <robertmaxrees> errr....
[09:34:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:35:30] <morfin> i think i need to get real XP for better testing
[09:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you can get a VM
[09:35:48] <morfin> because IETester is ugly
[09:35:54] <morfin> and strange
[09:36:01] <robertmaxrees> modern.ie yo
[09:36:12] <morfin> IE will die
[09:36:21] <robertmaxrees> you keep telling yourself that :)
[09:36:22] <morfin> WIndows 10 will have own browser
[09:36:30] <robertmaxrees> that's still IE.
[09:36:45] <morfin> they did not switch engine?
[09:36:58] <robertmaxrees> it's the IE11 engine with all the legacy stuff ripped out.
[09:37:03] <robertmaxrees> they kept compat mode in.
[09:37:29] <morfin> anyway
[09:37:42] <morfin> no useless shit, WebGL(!)
[09:37:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:38:59] <morfin> but EdgeHTML is just HTML rendering engine right
[09:40:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's a fork of Trident with all the legacy stuff removed
[09:41:13] <morfin> but what's JS "engine"?
[09:41:25] <robertmaxrees> whatever the current one is, which is damn good.
[09:41:38] <morfin> it even have Promises?
[09:41:43] <morfin> native ones
[09:42:25] <morfin> btw out apps are used inside of company
[09:42:25] <robertmaxrees> quick google will tell you.
[09:42:31] <robertmaxrees> so are mine.
[09:42:39] <morfin> so most of users do Chrome/Chromium/Firefox
[09:42:48] <wiggl3> For this page show/hide functionality: http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/bzo7qyoe/ -- how do I prevent visible pages from sliding up if their links are clicked twice?
[09:43:34] <morfin> and my code works fine even on default Android browser )
[09:43:36] <robertmaxrees> morfin a huge chunk of our paying customers use IE8 and above.
[09:43:57] <robertmaxrees> so we're friendly to them.  ecommerce is a slightly different beast.
[09:43:58] <morfin> some parts are for clients(statistics etc)
[09:44:58] <ajf-> How do I chain two $.when() functions so I can use just one set of .then() ?
[09:45:00] <ajf-> $.when($.when(..), $.when(..)) ?
[09:45:54] <morfin> let me check
[09:47:29] <morfin> yes it works even on default browser)
[09:48:16] <ajf-> ncie
[09:48:17] <ajf-> nice
[09:48:26] <morfin> i meant my app
[09:48:40] <morfin> hmmm
[09:49:38] <robertmaxrees> ajf- why not just pass the original objects in?
[09:49:49] <robertmaxrees> $.when(deferred1, deferred2, deferred3)
[09:49:54] <morfin> that's why i liked syntax like something(args_list).then(function(result,error){}).then(function(results){...}).catch(function(error){})
[09:49:54] <wiggl3> For this page show/hide functionality: http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/bzo7qyoe/ -- how do I prevent visible pages from sliding up if their links are clicked twice?
[09:50:07] <wiggl3> I came up with this solution: http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/bzo7qyoe/1/ -- feedback would be much appreciated!
[09:50:23] <robertmaxrees> morfin you can do that with jquery promises :)
[09:50:29] <wiggl3> it seems a weeeeee bit hackish, what y'all think? :D
[09:50:34] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: $.when($.when.apply(null, $.map(js_urls, $.cachedScript)),$.when.apply(null, $.map(css_urls, $.cachedStyle)))
[09:50:44] <ajf-> is it even possible? I'm already complicated with that function call
[09:50:49] <morfin> but i recall somebody said jQuery have bad promises
[09:50:54] <robertmaxrees> what's with the nested $.when() ?
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> $.map() isn't blocking, so i don't see why you're using promises here.
[09:51:22] <robertmaxrees> err, IS blocking - it's not async.
[09:51:50] <ajf-> because each $.cachedStyle(url) and $.cachedScript(url) returns a promise, and I have an array of urls for each one.
[09:51:55] <ajf-> I don't see how else I could do this
[09:52:01] <dismist> what has jquery come to :(
[09:52:16] <robertmaxrees> $.when($.cachedStyle(url), $.cachedScript(url)).then()
[09:52:17] <ajf-> complete Gist https://gist.github.com/b3241a76bd8416eb6e50
[09:52:34] <sacho_> ajf-, you could use add
[09:52:40] <ajf-> yes but I first have to map the urls arrays into $.cacheStyle and $.cachedScript
[09:52:58] <ajf-> sorry, complete Gist: https://gist.github.com/18ef5f6b6cf9ed1c6dbb
[09:53:08] <sacho_> $.when.apply(null, $.map(..).add($.map(...)))
[09:53:22] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[09:53:24] <morfin> how do jQuery select all DOM items using selectors?
[09:53:36] <morfin> does it just recursively iterate over whole tree?
[09:53:39] <robertmaxrees> morfin depends on the browser and selector.
[09:53:45] <morfin> and check conditions
[09:53:56] <morfin> oh i forgot
[09:54:08] <morfin> some browsers can select by class maybe
[09:54:12] <robertmaxrees> and ID.
[09:54:25] <robertmaxrees> there's also document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll() in more modern browsers.
[09:54:27] <morfin> ID is standard thing
[09:54:28] <sacho_> ajf-, jquery's promises are a bit hostile to combination :p
[09:54:47] <morfin> document.getElementById exists even in shitty IE
[09:54:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:55:00] <robertmaxrees> also: IE isn't all that shitty any more ;)
[09:55:21] <morfin> but i think only way to check if class presents in that browser using regex(attribute class)
[09:55:26] <morfin> maybe?
[09:55:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:55:41] <BillCriswell> morfin: No.
[09:55:45] <robertmaxrees> you want to see if an ID has a class?
[09:55:49] <morfin> no
[09:55:59] <morfin> i wanted to see if element X have class
[09:56:06] <BillCriswell> .hasClass('foo'), .is('.foo')
[09:56:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:56:14] <morfin> no
[09:56:23] <morfin> i meant how selectors do that
[09:56:35] <robertmaxrees> look at the browser engine and find out.
[09:56:36] <BillCriswell> el.classList.contains('foo')
[09:56:47] <morfin> ow that's an idea)
[09:56:50] <Omar-> wiggl3 you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/Lbek3knc/
[09:57:12] <morfin> some stuff in jQuery is really slow
[09:57:20] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:57:26] <morfin> like looking for element containing text
[09:57:27] <robertmaxrees> and performance shouldn't be your primary concern ever
[09:57:44] <robertmaxrees> even the folks in ##javascript will tell you that.
[09:57:53] <NoiseEee> morfin: that idea/concept is slow/a problem, not jquery
[09:57:59] <morfin> i know
[09:58:07] <morfin> i am avoiding such things
[09:58:21] <robertmaxrees> .filter() against a subset of elements is usually what you really want to do anyway.
[09:59:32] <morfin> and also avoiding using such things like $("div.someclass:not(somecond):eq(0)") or something like that
[09:59:49] <robertmaxrees> that's a classic "no-no" selector.
[10:00:14] <morfin> but in worst case i think jQuery fall back to stupid iteration over whole tree
[10:00:32] <robertmaxrees> what else is it supposed to do?
[10:07:04] <Omar-> nighty everyone!
[10:07:16] <BillCriswell> Night!
[10:08:03] <morfin> i wsa trying even server-side JS
[10:08:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:08:43] <morfin> that's lots of func except dealing with async stuff and that's why used Bluebird
[10:08:59] <morfin> *lots of fun
[10:10:00] <robertmaxrees> i like async.  promises make it even better
[10:10:35] <morfin> hmm interesting can JS get deadlock/race conditions
[10:12:43] <robertmaxrees> welcome to async.
[10:13:30] <morfin> i had that in Node.JS, had that in Boost(C++) and now i will have it on front-end side as well)
[10:13:48] <robertmaxrees> it's basically always been there on the frontend.
[10:14:08] <morfin> but i did not ever hear anybody use mutexes here
[10:15:33] <robertmaxrees> because you don't really need them.
[10:15:38] <robertmaxrees> not in JS at least.
[10:15:52] <morfin> and that's why i used Promises
[10:16:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:16:18] <morfin> they can help sort async things out
[10:16:36] <robertmaxrees> promises are just another way to manage your callbacks - that's all.
[10:16:46] <morfin> like when required run concurrent requests and wait until all of then will be ended
[10:16:57] <robertmaxrees> right.  promises simplify that greatly.
[10:17:06] <morfin> or wait just for one of them
[10:17:08] <morfin> etc
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:17:27] <morfin> but it helps to avoid parallel code issues
[10:17:39] <robertmaxrees> just like callbacks lol
[10:17:46] <robertmaxrees> 6 one way, half dozen the other.
[10:20:23] <morfin> he-he i am looking at jqWidgets now
[10:20:37] <morfin> seems like lots of fun in using that
[10:32:21] <jeffmjack> does anyone know of an effect to make show() transition elements in the same way that a mac opens image files when you double click them?  The effect is like a rectangle rapidly grows out of the icon that you clicked
[10:35:11] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Hmm...
[10:36:13] <BillCriswell> That would be a fun one.
[10:38:45] <jeffmjack> indeed :)
[10:39:46] <BillCriswell> So you want the element to move or call call in another element?
[10:42:29] <bbclover> hey robertmaxrees you're in both ##javascript and here
[10:42:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:42:35] <bbclover> that's pretty cool
[10:42:50] <robertmaxrees> i idle in like 9 channels on freenode.
[10:42:51] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[10:43:01] <bbclover> are you a javascript expert too?!
[10:43:12] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: yeah call in a hidden element with a top-level z-index
[10:43:14] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say "expert".  i know some things.
[10:43:17] <jeffmjack> and absolute positioning
[10:43:36] <jeffmjack> trying to mimic finder, basically (and no I'm not evil)
[10:44:14] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: Is there a consistent ratio between the items it'll be opening?
[10:44:15] <jeffmjack> I think what I'm looking for is the scale effect from jquery-ui
[10:44:16] <jeffmjack> :)
[10:44:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah sounds about right.
[10:44:44] <robertmaxrees> bbclover to good with jquery, you need to be good with javascript.
[10:44:58] <jeffmjack> no consistent ratio that I know of; each shown element will be an image with possibly different dimensions
[10:46:16] <Buzzyboy> Actually, I know very little native JavaScript commands. :P
[10:46:24] <Buzzyboy> But can work my way around jQuery very well.
[10:46:30] <robertmaxrees> you probably know much more than you think you do.
[10:46:46] <Buzzyboy> I don't even know how to log on the console.
[10:46:53] <Buzzyboy> To give you an idea of where I'm at.
[10:46:56] <Buzzyboy> With native JS.
[10:47:07] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[10:47:10] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[10:47:10] <Buzzyboy> But with jQuery, I made a drag and drop web designer.
[10:47:43] <Buzzyboy> I've even submitted improvements/fixes for the sortable and draggable widget.
[10:47:55] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[10:48:02] <jeffmjack> wait so does both jquery-ui and jquery have a show() method?
[10:48:19] <Buzzyboy> As I said, I just don't know a lot of it. Not that I don't use it.
[10:48:21] <jeffmjack> how would I distinguish the two in my code?
[10:48:31] <Buzzyboy> If it wasn't for intellisense, I wouldn't know crap. :P
[10:48:31] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack yes.  jquery ui overrides the plain one iirc.
[10:48:35] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: with jQuery UI show might be enhanced to do some more shit, kind of like .toggleClass
[10:48:47] <robertmaxrees> Buzzyboy i don't use tools like that.
[10:49:07] <Buzzyboy> Most of my development is in ASP.NET.
[10:49:22] <robertmaxrees> aye - when you get to the backend you need it, and intellisense is amazing.
[10:49:30] <robertmaxrees> i just don't use it for the stuff I'm doing :)
[10:49:39] <robertmaxrees> i worked in a .NET shop for a long time.
[10:49:44] <Buzzyboy> I just don't use the native functions.
[10:49:46] <Buzzyboy> A lot.
[10:49:49] <Buzzyboy> So I don't memorize them.
[10:49:57] <bbclover> but robertmaxrees you can't get into an ajax call on the ie debugger I think
[10:50:08] <robertmaxrees> bbclover huh?
[10:50:11] <Buzzyboy> I don't have to reference jQuery code though.
[10:50:24] <bbclover> it'll just skip over it if you debug the line
[10:50:30] <bbclover> and just do it
[10:50:31] <robertmaxrees> bbclover depends on the version.
[10:50:43] <robertmaxrees> IE11's step debugger is VERY feature-rich.
[10:50:56] <Buzzyboy> I agree.
[10:50:59] <bbclover> mine isn't getting into it
[10:51:03] <bbclover> it thinks of it as a line
[10:51:06] <Buzzyboy> I was considering switching from Chrome to IE11 for JS debugging.
[10:51:09] <robertmaxrees> it even highlights which part of the line it's evaluating.
[10:51:19] <robertmaxrees> bbclover are you sure you don't have another error going on?
[10:51:24] <robertmaxrees> because that sounds wrong.
[10:54:35] <bbclover> yeah let me look into it some more
[10:54:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having, exactly?
[10:55:35] <Buzzyboy> The guy who made those slides is hilarious robertmaxrees.
[10:55:58] <robertmaxrees> Adam's an awesome guy.
[10:59:34] <hellofoo> hey does jquery ui kind of overlap certain features of bootstrap? is this a bad thing?
[10:59:50] <robertmaxrees> it has some widgets and things that overlap, yeah.
[10:59:56] <robertmaxrees> dunno if it's a "bad" thing necessarily.
[11:01:09] <hellofoo> oh i see robertmaxrees
[11:01:19] <powermac> Ahoy hoy #jquery... i've forgoten the name of a command... I want to stage a number of edits to the dom on a psuedo dom, and then implement them all in one pass.  What's the word I should be googling for that?
[11:01:36] <robertmaxrees> document fragment.
[11:01:56] <robertmaxrees> you can just use a jquery object for it instead, if you want, which uses a fragment under the head.
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> *hood
[11:01:59] <hellofoo> robertmaxrees: will using those widgets for UI instead of bootstrap offer more functionality than normal?
[11:02:33] <OnceMe> Hello
[11:02:38] <robertmaxrees> they might offer different functionality.
[11:03:01] <robertmaxrees> fwiw my company is moving to all bootstrap right now - we'll reconsider JQUI after some updates are released there that should greatly improve it.
[11:03:08] <OnceMe> from some reason if(event.keyCode == 13){ console.log("hj,"); } that works for enter (ok fine I need that) and for shift + enter (why?)?
[11:03:09] <powermac> thanks... also, using a jquery object?  still a novice so that doesn't quite make sense to me... uhm... any suggestions on introductions to jquery objects?
[11:03:10] <robertmaxrees> all about tradeoffs.
[11:03:26] <robertmaxrees> powermac $('<div>Some element</div>')
[11:03:35] <hellofoo> ah ok.. I'll look at my options to see how they differ.. thanks robertmaxrees
[11:03:43] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe because you're hitting enter still.
[11:03:49] <robertmaxrees> shift + enter is two separate events.
[11:03:49] <OnceMe> makes sense
[11:03:57] <OnceMe> can I make it when I press shift + enter
[11:04:00] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe shift down, enter down, enter up, shift up
[11:04:00] <OnceMe> to not apply that code?
[11:04:09] <OnceMe> ?
[11:04:17] <robertmaxrees> detect if shift is down.
[11:04:25] <OnceMe> ok
[11:04:36] <Bafflermeal> robertmaxrees: That fixingthesejquery.com link is awesome. I'm spamming it to my colleagues.
[11:04:42] <robertmaxrees> good :)
[11:05:02] <OnceMe> ok now works
[11:05:08] <OnceMe> but I dont get new line in textarea :(
[11:05:14] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe check out http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html and http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[11:05:24] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault() likely isn't what you want, OnceMe.  what are you trying to do?
[11:05:31] <OnceMe> code http://pastebin.com/3wksYAQM
[11:05:40] <robertmaxrees> context is critical here
[11:05:40] <OnceMe> yeah I have e.preventDefault();
[11:06:10] <robertmaxrees> i can read that - i need context for the code you share.d
[11:06:14] <robertmaxrees> what is it trying to prevent?
[11:06:41] <OnceMe> code http://pastebin.com/NgzG3zWB
[11:06:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you running e.preventDefault();?
[11:07:04] <OnceMe> so you have textarea, on enter you get appended content, and on shift + enter, you get a new line in textarea
[11:07:36] <OnceMe> its preventDefault() on clicker
[11:07:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:07:57] <robertmaxrees> why are you using preventDefault/return false?
[11:08:33] <OnceMe> ok works now
[11:08:35] <OnceMe> if (e.keyCode == 13 && !e.shiftKey) made it work
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to prevent a form submit?  newline?  this is important.
[11:08:49] <robertmaxrees> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html this is invaluable in cases like this.
[11:08:55] <robertmaxrees> and avoid return false; btw
[11:12:03] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees:I have this problem http://jsfiddle.net/YRKxR/17/
[11:12:20] <OnceMe> when I append in textarea with break lines, s n it appends to only one line
[11:12:23] <OnceMe> no breaks, why
[11:13:37] <robertmaxrees> because html doesn't preserve them the way you think they do.
[11:15:14] <OnceMe> ok how to fix it
[11:15:46] <robertmaxrees> use a regular expression to detect the newlines and replace them with <br>
[11:15:55] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, question why you need them in the first place.
[11:16:10] <marc_v92> I'm doing a  $.get("/posts/", postsCallback) on an HTTPS page, but I'm getting a Mixed Content error saying that it can't load "http://MY_SITE/posts/" -- why is jQuery trying to do the request over HTTP when it's on an HTTPS page?
[11:16:54] <robertmaxrees> marc_v92 it probably isn't - try hitting the url with the https and make sure you're not getting redirected.
[11:17:14] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees: I can confirm that everything is being served over HTTPS. :)
[11:17:28] <robertmaxrees> triple check?
[11:17:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery should be requesting over https
[11:17:58] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees: I have, lol. Checked, nothing. Googled, nothing. Checked, nothing. StackOverflow'd, nothing. Checked again, nothing.
[11:18:12] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[11:18:25] <marc_v92> 1.11.1
[11:18:45] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: is it different if you use .ajax?
[11:18:59] <marc_v92> NoiseEee: Will try that now.
[11:19:27] <robertmaxrees> i might try the fully qualified url if that doesn't work to see if you still get the error.
[11:20:06] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: http://jsbin.com/cezevi/1/edit?css,js,output I started this but got bored
[11:21:44] <marc_v92> NoiseEee: Same issue.
[11:21:57] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: somethings going on ;)
[11:22:02] <robertmaxrees> marc_v92 try the full URL with the protocol included.
[11:22:14] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees: It seems to work when I use the full URL, but this is for a system that spins up new instances on a per-client basis -- so I'd like to avoid any hard-coded URLs if possible.
[11:22:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm not suggesting that as a fix, but that signals that there's something else going on.
[11:22:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to make sure the current page doesn't have mixed content or something else causing headaches.
[11:23:00] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: i do secure xhr requests all the time like $.ajax('/path/to/url.php')
[11:23:08] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: ^^
[11:23:16] <NoiseEee> its gotta be something else other than the xhr request itself.
[11:23:33] <NoiseEee> what does the debugger say? is it going to https in the network panel?
[11:23:54] <robertmaxrees> could also try console logging out window.location.href before the request fires to see if the URL is what you think it is.
[11:27:37] <OnceMe> here http://pastebin.com/tvm8tBY9
[11:27:55] <OnceMe> I am escapingHtml and when I append txtxss it gets like sometxt <br /> somemoretext
[11:28:05] <OnceMe> and when I remove escapeHtml it appends fine, like sometxt
[11:28:06] <OnceMe> somemoretext
[11:28:15] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle, yo.
[11:28:41] <robertmaxrees> unless you're not having problems any more.
[11:30:53] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees NoiseEee : Yeah, I'm pretty much out of ideas, lol. All files are properly serving over HTTPS, there's no mixed content on any of the pages. Even found an obscure SO post that said to make sure URLs end in a slash -- no luck.
[11:31:08] <OnceMe> it works fine
[11:31:11] <OnceMe> except the part I told
[11:31:14] <OnceMe> I need a way around
[11:31:29] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe I'm not going to play guessing games today mano - setup a fiddle :)
[11:31:32] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: let us know when you solve it :)
[11:31:56] <NoiseEee> marc_v92: the quick answer to your question is that if you're on https and do an xhr request to "/some/url" it will also be https
[11:32:25] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if there are redirects happening in between that go one way,then the other.
[11:44:05] <marc_v92> Still haven't solved it, but the weirdness continues.
[11:44:24] <marc_v92> There's another function that calls the exact same URL in the exact same way...no errors.
[11:44:34] <marc_v92> I might just wipe out the function that's causing the problem and rewrite it.
[11:45:13] <misza222> Hi folks, I have a jquery mobile panel with nested menu. Would like it to expand/collapse gently with a slide. So far I have http://jsfiddle.net/misza222/n4fyc1ef/ but it doesn't work as expected. What am I doing wrong?
[11:49:37] <Buzzyboy> How is it not working as expected?
[11:49:41] <Buzzyboy> Do you just want it to transition more smoothly?
[11:51:00] <misza222> Buzzyboy: first, initially it is expanding and immediately collapsing, then when closing one, another expands etc
[11:51:17] <misza222> there is something wrong with the way I've done it, but can't spot the problem
[11:57:26] <Buzzyboy> Fiddle is not agreeing with my browser right now.
[12:01:11] <Buzzy> @.@
[12:01:18] <Buzzy> Got renamed.
[12:03:23] <Zzaichik> misza222: you're targeting the same data-role for both slideUp and SlideDown
[12:04:20] <Mhank> Hello
[12:06:25] <Mhank> http://jsbin.com/saqulicewe/1/edit
[12:06:40] <Mhank> how can I to do somwe like this?
[12:07:00] <Mhank> I need to set that options outside of fields array
[12:07:06] <Mhank> is possible?
[12:07:08] <misza222> Zzaichik, ok, you think that It may be the problem? In the handler I'm selecting correct collapsible content
[12:08:55] <misza222> even if I make it more specific, it is not sliding properly - on the first click it expands, then slowly collapses
[12:08:57] <Zzaichik> misza222: It seems like both events are firing every time.
[12:09:17] <misza222> http://jsfiddle.net/misza222/n4fyc1ef/8/
[12:09:30] <Buzzy> Yes. They are. You can do transitions with CSS.
[12:09:36] <Mhank> someome can help plese?
[12:09:46] <Mhank> please*
[12:09:56] <Buzzy> I was trying to get you a working example, but fiddle absolutely refuses ot work for me.
[12:10:04] <Buzzy> to*
[12:10:58] <misza222> Buzzy, did you try to fork the code?
[12:11:07] <Buzzy> I'd love to.
[12:11:10] <Zzaichik> misza222: http://jsfiddle.net/n4fyc1ef/10/
[12:11:11] <Buzzy> If the page would load.
[12:11:19] <Zzaichik> not quite right but better.  misza222
[12:11:31] <Buzzy> Seems my work is temporarily blocking jsfiddle.net.
[12:11:43] <Buzzy> It let me access it once.
[12:12:35] <misza222> Zzaichik, this is default behaviour - without animation the opening/closing
[12:12:43] <misza222> that's not what I'm looking for
[12:14:41] <misza222> Buzzy, how about jsbin? http://jsbin.com/mobomugeva/1/edit
[12:19:58] <Buzzy> That worked.
[12:20:15] <Buzzy> I'll see what I can do.
[12:22:26] <choosegoose> how would I insert text with newlines into a textarea (i.e. $myTextarea.text("hello\nworld") )
[12:23:08] <misza222> Buzzy, great!
[12:23:10] <OnceMe> choosegoose:thats what I asked like 30 mins ago
[12:23:28] <Buzzy> $textArea.text($textArea.text()+ "Hello world");
[12:25:18] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/m8uuznh6/ @ choosegoose
[12:27:04] <choosegoose> ah, so the issue is actually: how can I convert newlines as represented here: <a data-mytext="hello\nworld"> so they can be actual newlines in $mylink.data('mytext')
[12:29:14] <choosegoose> nvm: .replace(/(?:\\n)/g, '\n')
[12:32:22] <Buzzy> Haven't forgotten about you misza222.
[12:32:22] <Buzzy> Boss just came in asking me questions.
[12:32:59] <alexclark_> I have a button that slides out for them side of the page. I am using stickem to make the buttons change from fixed to absolute positioning and thus have to change their position. The position triggers the slideout transition and makes a weird slide out action. So I tried this but its not working https://gist.github.com/alexclarkofficial/c4148c5cc4947dc293e8
[12:33:29] <alexclark_> any idea how i can kill the transition while adding a class and repositioning?
[12:38:02] <Mhank> Can I to set inside an array a var like this
[12:38:02] <Mhank> http://jsbin.com/saqulicewe/1/edit
[12:38:07] <Mhank> ??
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> nothing in there is an array.
[12:38:48] <Mhank> how is possible to do some like this?
[12:39:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're trying to do >.>
[12:40:00] <Mhank> I need to set different options for jtable plugin according which options is selected
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> in this specific example, I mean.
[12:41:15] <Mhank> this is my complete script
[12:41:16] <Mhank> http://jsfiddle.net/7v1qj0tr/
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> lol not helping.  go back to your first example.
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> what do you expect to happen with that function.
[12:41:59] <Mhank> I need to replace fields array with my dynamic optinos
[12:42:09] <alexclark_> ahhh i had to trigger a reflow!
[12:42:40] <Mhank> I have three different options, so I need to set different fields in table according which is selected
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> Mhank first off, none of these are arrays.
[12:42:42] <Mhank> now is working
[12:43:09] <Mhank> is for not to do three same functions , one for each one option
[12:43:54] <robertmaxrees> i really wish i understood what you inteded this example to do.
[12:44:13] <Buzzy> It's time for lunch now.
[12:44:44] <Buzzy> But I did make some progress on your nested menu.
[12:45:14] <Buzzy> misza222, instead of using event.stopDefault(), you should be using event.stopImmediatePropagation()
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> or preventDefault();
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you intend.
[12:45:35] <Buzzy> But it doesn't fix all the issues.
[12:45:39] <Buzzy> He's using preventDefault().
[12:45:46] <Buzzy> He's having collisions of jQuery events.
[12:45:49] <robertmaxrees> ah event bubbling causing issues?
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[12:46:07] <robertmaxrees> Mhank your bin is basically this: http://jsbin.com/pupusayuwo/1/edit
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> so i'm trying to understand what that function is supposed t do.
[12:47:26] <Mhank> robertmaxrees : that function now is for show a table onload the page. works ok
[12:47:50] <robertmaxrees> Mhank focus here: http://jsbin.com/pupusayuwo/1/edit?html,js,output - update the bin to show me how you'd use that function.
[12:47:53] <Mhank> But I have a variation, the user must to select one of three possible option
[12:48:13] <Mhank> with each one selected option must to change the fields
[12:49:21] <kevireilly> Am I recalling correctly that the `click` event is fired when both a `mousedown` and `mouseup` occur within the element?
[12:49:35] <robertmaxrees> Mhank you want to dynamically access a property on an object?
[12:49:49] <Mhank> yes
[12:50:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/zapuzugoxi/1/edit
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> have to use square bracket notation.
[12:51:12] <kevireilly> regarding `click`, the documentation seems to somewhat suggest that at least for the literal click method versus event
[12:51:27] <kevireilly> I'm trying to figure out why a `mousedown` and `mouseup` would be fired for an element but not a `click`
[12:51:38] <robertmaxrees> because the click event was prevented.
[12:52:17] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: as in e.preventDefault()? Oddly, this occurs at random
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[12:52:49] <kevireilly> ideas on how to figure out what?
[12:52:59] <kevireilly> there are no reliable steps to reproduce
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> step debugger in the event handler and watch the event object.
[12:54:00] <kevireilly> that would be amazing, but the only debugger option I have is a remote debugger that doesn't have that functionality
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> bwuh?
[12:54:24] <Buzzy> MADNESS.
[12:54:27] <robertmaxrees> so what are the constraints?  like, what 's the device, etc.?
[12:54:28] <kevireilly> its been rough
[12:54:43] <robertmaxrees> ಠ╭╮ಠ
[12:54:47] <kevireilly> custom platform essentially
[12:54:56] <kevireilly> webkit from years ago
[12:56:11] <Mhank> http://jsfiddle.net/fn4mh55p/
[12:56:28] <Mhank> I wanna to do run this, but I don't now exactly why dont'
[12:56:30] <Mhank> dont*
[12:56:37] <Mhank> don't
[12:57:29] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: I am able to inspect the click events bound to the element (none) and the dom (2 that I've implemented) and neither are preventing default, returning false, or anything along those lines
[12:57:50] <kevireilly> assuming $._data($(dom)[0], 'events'); is accurate
[13:17:05] <misza222> Buzzy, thanks
[13:30:29] <Es0teric> i have a script url, how do i import it through jquery?
[13:34:02] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: $.getScript is one way.
[13:34:11] <Es0teric> BillCriswell thats all i needed to know, thanks
[13:34:30] <BillCriswell> No probslems
[13:41:56] <CDSCSE> Hello all, does anyone know how to hit both the success and error callbacks using $.when and a array of jQuery Deferred?  I only get the fail result using always and i think ive came close using pipe.
[13:42:05] <duch_kazatel> you can't.
[13:42:18] <duch_kazatel> once an object has hit resolved or rejected, that's it.
[13:42:55] <CDSCSE> so if you have an array of promises and some fail but others pass, you can only see which fail?
[13:43:57] <duch_kazatel> " The method will resolve its master Deferred as soon as all the Deferreds resolve, or reject the master Deferred as soon as one of the Deferreds is rejected."
[13:44:23] <CDSCSE> hmm, thanks
[13:44:48] <CDSCSE> im gonna try looking through the array in the always method and checking which were resolved/rejected
[13:47:57] <CDSCSE> also, ive been using firefox dev tools but the debugging feature is really lacking when it comes to parallel promises, do you know if chrome or some other tool works better?
[13:48:09] <duch_kazatel> i use FF and don't have any issues with it.
[13:48:31] <duch_kazatel> but i could see why others might - dunno of any tools out there for it.
[13:49:05] <CDSCSE> hmm, ive been experiencing some breakpoints being skipped or happening out of order (always being triggered before then)
[13:49:47] <duch_kazatel> i'd have ot see what you're talking about.
[13:59:16] <Tawre> when i use $.ajax i have a success function called
[13:59:43] <Tawre> is there some clever way to structure the code in a way so that i could put the ajax call into a function and return the data on succee
[13:59:59] <duch_kazatel> Tawre nope.
[14:00:13] <duch_kazatel> could use deferreds though.
[14:00:16] <duch_kazatel> like a bawse.
[14:00:19] <Tawre> so each time i use $.ajax i have to go a level deeper into the function call hierarchy?
[14:00:33] <duch_kazatel> yes, because it's async.
[14:29:13] <claytonzaugg> Is there anyone that's really good with resolving Absolute vs Relative when trying to fill the "rest of the screen" dynamically with a widget?
[14:31:14] <duch_kazatel> did you have a question?
[14:41:12] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, were you referring to me?
[14:41:18] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:42:48] <claytonzaugg> I'll try and long story short this.  Quite a few divs down, no height is assigned but this form is only x pixels in height.  Instead of it being x pixels (100% actually) I'd like to find the current window height, subtract the pixels above the form (where the header, logo, menu's are) and assign a height to the form so it fills down to the bottom of the screen
[14:42:54] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ claytonzaugg
[14:42:55] <b-ot> claytonzaugg: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:43:19] <duch_kazatel> i see you trying to get help in ##javascript, but i wonder if a live example wouldn't be helpful here.
[14:44:20] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, I think I just got a solution, lemme give it a try and come back if I need it, and show you the code.
[14:44:25] <duch_kazatel> lol okay
[14:51:22] <ajf-> How come $.ajax() with 'cache:false' will not make a new request for en external URL, but will for an internal file ('path/to/file')? I see a request for them with a 302 response and always a 128B content, but for URLs I see (from cache).
[14:51:34] <ajf-> Sorry, I meant with 'cache:true' there ^
[14:52:31] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[14:52:45] <ntcbow> what?
[14:52:48] <robertmaxrees> so you have a case where you're getting new requests for external resources?
[14:53:15] <robertmaxrees> even though you have cache: true set?
[14:53:43] <robertmaxrees> ajf- ^
[14:55:35] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/jdecX5q.png
[14:56:34] <robertmaxrees> please don't do that.
[14:56:46] <robertmaxrees> your question didn't make sense.  try again.
[14:57:44] <ajf-> alright let me try again.
[14:58:02] <ajf-> these are two functions I'm using to asynchronously load CSS and JS files: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bdc96ca083f0bea81ff9
[14:58:10] <robertmaxrees> you're setting cache: true for an ajax call.  some things are working right, others aren't.
[14:58:30] <ajf-> indeed
[14:59:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.  the external resources are the ones that aren't caching, right?
[15:00:15] <ajf-> let me explain
[15:03:33] <aias> because this is one of the busiest webdev channels... what template are these modern sites using: dictionary.reference.com, stackoverflow.com
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> ... none?
[15:04:09] <aias> i can't think of any more examples. but i see this theme/structure everywhere now. the tall, dark grey footer is rarely changed
[15:04:10] <robertmaxrees> their own?
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not a template, just a common design.
[15:04:48] <ajf-> Alright, what I'm seeing is this: The external files loaded with $.cachedScript (which uses $.ajax) don't get new requests. The internal JS files, as the internal AND external CSS files (gotten with $.cachedStyle, which also uses $.ajax) all get a new request each time that has a 304 response the second time around, with a 128B weight.
[15:05:54] <ajf-> Also, the External CSS files will have a 200 response and the "Size column" says: (from cache)
[15:06:36] <ajf-> which might mean it works for external css files but AFAIK it shouldn't be making a new request
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code it's hard to say, but my guess is that maybe the server is doing something funky to circumvent that?
[15:07:34] <ajf-> here is the code for both functions (it is very straightforward)  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bdc96ca083f0bea81ff9
[15:08:38] <ajf-> Maybe, I didn't know jQuery's caching mechanism had anything to do with the server's responses
[15:09:55] <ajf-> Ahh.. I see
[15:10:00] <ajf-> cache: true does nothing
[15:10:24] <ajf-> cache: false forces the browser to get a fresh copy, but cache: true just lets the browser handle it normally
[15:10:37] <ajf-> so yeah this might be some headers thing
[16:55:23] <snkmad> is it possible to do something like this? http://pastebin.com/BBW0P6jL
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> though your selectors don't really make sense
[16:56:55] <snkmad> yeah i fixed that wait
[16:58:47] <snkmad> http://pastebin.com/bnZSuCRv
[16:59:02] <robertmaxrees> still really strange.
[16:59:03] <snkmad> when i try to do this, only the last one is ran
[16:59:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you using getElementById() there?
[16:59:23] <snkmad> ive been told to
[16:59:29] <snkmad> but i can use jQuery selectors
[16:59:30] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:59:32] <systemfault> There's no reason to use getElementById... the second parameter of .on is a selector.
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery selectors delegate there.
[16:59:35] <snkmad> like #button
[17:00:48] <snkmad> http://pastebin.com/VfZX4Csa
[17:00:51] <snkmad> so this should work?
[17:01:06] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid.
[17:01:10] <snkmad> yeah sorry
[17:01:19] <snkmad> forget the last ) after '#div'
[17:01:34] <snkmad> just tired and stuck with this
[17:01:35] <robertmaxrees> you stiull have an extra )
[17:01:38] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/frsyr3c/
[17:02:00] <robertmaxrees> does searchBlacklist() return anything?
[17:02:06] <snkmad> it didnt
[17:02:10] <snkmad> then i added a boolean
[17:02:13] <snkmad> to return
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you returning?
[17:02:45] <snkmad> if it found anything on the blacklist
[17:02:53] <robertmaxrees> return false; will break things.
[17:03:00] <robertmaxrees> it'll cause the second one to not run.
[17:03:12] <snkmad> actually it only runs the 2nd one
[17:03:18] <snkmad> i put some console.log
[17:03:21] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[17:03:25] <snkmad> and only the 2nd one is show
[17:03:29] <robertmaxrees> eithe rwya, that's your problem.
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> that return is what's breaking things.
[17:04:08] <robertmaxrees> return false; basically runs e.stopImmediatePropagation(); under the hood.
[17:04:11] <robertmaxrees> remove that return.
[17:04:16] <snkmad> thanks
[17:04:18] <snkmad> will try now
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> also you only need one event binding.
[17:05:22] <snkmad> how so?
[17:05:28] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/frsyr3c/#url=caspycl
[17:05:59] <robertmaxrees> though i'd argue you shouldn't be passing any params in there at all.
[17:06:18] <robertmaxrees> getting you to this: fixee.org/paste/frsyr3c/#url=caspycl
[17:07:08] <snkmad> i need to run the same function with 2 diferent params
[17:07:14] <snkmad> when the button is clicked
[17:07:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you shouldn't need to pass in params - the handler should get everything it needs on its own.
[17:07:59] <snkmad> ok, those params are 2 diferent elements, 1 input and 1 textarea
[17:08:16] <robertmaxrees> you can check to see which element was clicked in the event handler.
[17:08:36] <snkmad> inside of the searchBlacklist function?
[17:08:39] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/715t1kLo/
[17:12:17] <snkmad> the thing is, i'm clicking on only button once, and need to run the search twice, each time on a diferent element
[17:12:38] <snkmad> sorry if i'm sounding so stupid, been trying this for long time now
[17:12:45] <robertmaxrees> the event handler should handle all that, then.
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[17:14:25] <snkmad> should i make a for() inside of the event handler, to run each one in the same function?
[17:14:55] <robertmaxrees> don't use for loops :)
[17:15:01] <snkmad> ok
[17:15:06] <baako> I want to add a class when I click on  a list of nav? and remove that class and add another when its on that page. I am using on js, css and html no backend
[17:15:06] <snkmad> i'm just out of ideas here
[17:15:11] <baako> its a one page
[17:15:18] <robertmaxrees> snkmad that's why i'm going to show you.
[17:15:35] <snkmad> robertmaxrees: thanks man
[17:16:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/715t1kLo/2/ like this.
[17:16:40] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ baako
[17:16:40] <b-ot> baako: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:17:31] <baako> robertmaxrees: Hi http://jsfiddle.net/baako/arwjkoh0/
[17:17:55] <snkmad> robertmaxrees:thanks will try that
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> baako so when you click something you want to add a class?  what have you tried?
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> snkmad should be pretty straightforward.
[17:19:34] <holler> anyone sharp with qunit/sinon? I have question
[17:19:45] <robertmaxrees> just ask - you might get an answer :)
[17:20:06] <robertmaxrees> baako -> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/arwjkoh0/1/
[17:20:16] <holler> http://goo.gl/oN68xm
[17:20:18] <holler> thats question
[17:20:46] <holler> having trouble with sinon.spy and async
[17:20:53] <holler> new to both qunit and sinon
[17:21:08] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on an async call finishing needs to be in a callback for the async call.
[17:21:36] <robertmaxrees> not familiar enough with qunit and sinon specifically, but sounds like you're confused by async.
[17:25:19] <baako> robertmaxrees: thank you again
[17:25:34] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:36:31] <snkmad> robertmaxrees:found my mistake, had to remove underscore debounce function
[17:36:40] <snkmad> thats why only 1 was working
[17:36:45] <snkmad> thanks for your time man
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it, too.
[17:36:52] <robertmaxrees> consider that refactor though.
[17:37:02] <snkmad> man javascript will kill me
[17:37:05] <snkmad> :P
[17:37:09] <robertmaxrees> nah js is awesome.
[17:37:14] <snkmad> i know
[17:37:20] <snkmad> but still have tons to learn about it
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> thaat'll never stop.
[17:40:46] <snkmad> thanks again and good night
[18:02:53] <baako> I have building an app using phonegap. I have a slide in and out menu. When i click on the menu button the menu slides out but i want it to slide back in when i touch outside the menu div any ideas how to do this?
[18:03:48] <robertmaxrees> ..
[18:03:55] <robertmaxrees> ask in one place at a time, yo.
[18:05:19] <baako> was gonna ask here first but was in css channel
[18:38:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: you still around?
[18:38:13] <robertmaxrees> yep
[18:40:41] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[18:40:53] <robertmaxrees> don't ask if i'm here and then ping me in other channels.
[18:41:56] <baako> sorry its a css/js question so kinda confused where to ask
[18:42:10] <robertmaxrees> you asked if i'm here.  ask the question here.
[18:43:49] <baako> robertmaxrees: This image http://postimg.org/image/c1ml4vvef/ basically shows What I am trying to do, which is  when you click on the menu icon the menu slides out. How do I include that yellow part in the slide out? It needs to be in a different colour
[18:45:30] <robertmaxrees> no clue what your code looks like dude.
[18:48:19] <baako> my code is long and using different css files but what is the general idea behind doing something like that?
[18:49:04] <robertmaxrees> use CSS.
[18:49:11] <robertmaxrees> that's the general idea.
[18:50:13] <robertmaxrees> you have a container for the sidebar, a container for that top bit, and a container for the menu.
[18:50:36] <robertmaxrees> the background for the sidebar is that yellow, and the background colors for the top and menu portions are the greyish bit.
[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> and with that, enjoy.
[18:56:08] <baako> he didnt get it
[19:06:47] <eBureau> can anyone please recommend me a plugin to achieve this slide/scrolling effect? http://www.acamica.com/
[20:00:57] <wiggl3> Are there any benefits in using this mobile side menu: https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/ over a pure CSS one like http://www.scottohara.me/article/morph-button-updated.html?
[22:19:47] <Buzzyboy> So quiet.
