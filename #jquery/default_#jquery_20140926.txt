[00:01:18] <advcha> Paradisee : but if you clear the input and type another word like 'ab', it supposed to display Abu Dhabi, Abuja,etc. but none appear
[00:05:21] <Paradisee> advcha: ill give a look to your code right now..
[00:05:28] <Paradisee> im at work actually sorry
[00:05:53] <advcha> Paradisee : Its ok. Thanks for the fiddle
[00:31:51] <linix> hello
[00:32:55] <linix> I want to use jquery-ui 1.11.1. Is it compatible with jquery-2.1.1 ?
[00:33:35] <linix> It is not stated clearly on the website. It says compatible with jquery 1.6+ /
[00:34:21] <linix> Does that mean compatible with jquery 1.6.x ?
[00:36:45] <sammych1> I GIVE UP. I SHALL USE ARRAY.MAP!
[00:40:34] <linix> "JQuery UI 1.11.0 supports jQuery 1.6 and newer."  <-- what does this mean ? Does it mean it supports jquery-2.1.1 too ?
[01:08:17] <Cork> linix: did you miss the "and newer" part?
[01:09:40] <linix> Cork: ok. I had a typo error and I just couldn't see it. My mind started to doubt the meaning. It's ok now.I found it.
[01:27:24] <rominronin> Hi
[01:29:06] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/nqy4ztn2/
[01:29:37] <rominronin> I need help on this page navigation: menu divs on the top row, target divs, which fade in/out as you click the ‘next’ button (within the target div itself)
[01:29:46] <rominronin> the problem I have is; I’ve defined a function that jumps to any of the divs in the menu IF IT’S ALREADY BEEN VISITED
[01:29:55] <rominronin> the function targets $(‘.visited’)
[01:30:18] <rominronin> but it DOES NOT WORK - and I think it’s because the ‘visited’ class is being added after the page loads
[01:30:20] <rominronin> so what’s the correct way to define the function so it works regardless of when the visited was added?

[02:24:20] <d0de> what's the defined behavior when a fadeOut() interupts a currently running fadeIn()?
[02:25:05] <d0de> e.g. I call fadeIn(5000) and then 1 second later I call fadeOut(5000) on the same element?
[02:27:33] <Cork> d0de: they don't interupt
[02:27:35] <Cork> they queue
[02:27:49] <Cork> if you want to interrupt a running animation you need to call .stop
[02:28:04] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com stop
[02:28:06] <b-ot> Cork: .stop() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[02:28:17] <litropy> I just realized that the reason why my image positioning is messed up is because I'm doing the calc before the image begins to load; after the element is in the DOM yet before the dimension info is accessible. What's the best way to wait until the dimension info is available?
[02:28:18] <d0de> Cork, great, thanks. That's the behavior I was experiencing but I wasn't sure if it was intended or not
[02:29:03] <Cork> litropy: you would have to bind the load event on the image
[02:29:07] <Cork> before you add it to the dom
[02:40:16] <DelphiWorld> 'lo jquerysts
[02:40:26] <DelphiWorld> please if someone know a small rss news ticker let me know
[02:40:48] <Jattenalle> ok
[02:42:20] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: :)
[02:45:25] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: i want it a dynamic one
[02:45:49] <Jattenalle> you misunderstood, i answered your question.. it's way too generic
[02:46:15] <Jattenalle> what language? client or server side? what features do you want? what do you mean, ticker? etc
[02:46:20] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: no i didnt understand :)
[02:46:35] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: client side, jquery
[02:46:46] <DelphiWorld> i just want a scrolling news ticker from a rss feed
[02:48:07] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: i think i found one, but not sure if its work. i'lle try it out
[02:53:00] <litropy> Cork, wait wait wait ... I thought an element isn't selectable until it is added to the DOM. $(".myclass").bind( ... ); $("#mydiv").html('<img class="myclass">'); ?
[02:53:55] <Cork> litropy: var fragment = $(html); fragment.find('img').on('load', func); $(target).append(fragment);
[02:54:31] <Cork> litropy: as long as it is a document tree you can select in it
[02:54:42] <Cork> doens't have to be part of the main tree
[02:57:26] <DelphiWorld> Jattenalle: http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/
[02:57:59] <litropy> Cork, the image attempts to load as soon as it is stored into a var?
[02:58:08] <Cork> litropy: no
[02:58:19] <Cork> they are trying to load when you append them to the document
[02:58:37] <litropy> Cork, thx.
[02:59:06] <DelphiWorld> hi Jamal1337
[03:07:27] <DelphiWorld> all plugins i see do only news from a list... not from rss;(
[03:08:13] <mooncup> I remember rss
[03:08:27] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: lol what else:P
[03:08:30] <mooncup> it's all push push push now
[03:08:37] <mooncup> no one has time for little old rss in this day and age :<
[03:08:45] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: explain
[03:08:48] <mooncup> well
[03:08:53] <mooncup> everyone just pushes information now
[03:08:58] <mooncup> rather than waiting for the client to grab it
[03:09:13] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: what to use to do that, show me
[03:09:18] <DelphiWorld> love to have mooncup suggestion
[03:09:29] <mooncup> I wasn't really reading
[03:09:32] <mooncup> what is it you want to do?
[03:09:42] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: pretty pretty simple
[03:10:09] <DelphiWorld> small jqm site with 3tabs, and scrolling news
[03:10:49] <mooncup> could set up a node server with sockets
[03:10:53] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: the news comming from wordpress blog
[03:10:53] <mooncup> then you get to use all the buzzwords
[03:11:01] <mooncup> like webscale and cloud
[03:11:22] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: complicated for a small site that have news from wp
[03:11:28] <mooncup> yeah true
[03:11:38] <mooncup> you don't need rss though
[03:11:45] <mooncup> what's wrong with just passing it as json?
[03:11:46] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: so suggest a small solution to do
[03:11:58] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: how do i pass it json from wwp?
[03:12:08] <mooncup> no idea how to from wordpress in particular
[03:12:19] <mooncup> but you can turn a php array/object into json with json_encode($var)
[03:12:28] <DelphiWorld> remember mooncup i'm blind and design is a bit complicated for me, that way i'm trying to simplify a much at i can
[03:12:39] <mooncup> well json has no design at all
[03:12:41] <mooncup> tis pure data
[03:12:54] <mooncup> https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/
[03:12:57] <mooncup> how about that?
[03:13:04] <mooncup> idk if it's any good, it's the first google result
[03:13:45] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: maybe, i'lle try it out, no idea if it can get news from particular category...
[03:14:46] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: but the push way, do you have any particular open source project?
[03:15:00] <mooncup> nope
[03:15:16] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: it seem a good solution for me
[03:15:27] <mooncup> also this https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/push-notifications
[03:15:48] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: this is for iOS / mobile i think no? :P
[03:16:36] <mooncup> yeah but it could be adapted I would assume
[03:17:27] <DelphiWorld> i dont think if its specific for APN:P
[03:32:13] <Kartagis> by "handle" little icon which you could click and drag some element is meant, right?
[03:37:21] <DelphiWorld> question mooncup
[03:37:37] <DelphiWorld> if i push using node.JS socket would that still be visible after reloading the page or will be gone
[03:38:14] <litropy> Cork, I'm having trouble understanding var fragment = $(html). How do I add something to the document tree without adding it to the DOM?
[03:38:42] <Cork> litropy: you don't add it to the page before you append it
[03:38:57] <Cork> that just converts the html to dom elements
[03:39:01] <Cork> and creates a document fragment
[03:39:58] <Kartagis> by "handle", little icon which you could click and drag some element is meant, right?
[03:50:40] <DelphiWorld> mooncup: i love your socketio solution...
[03:52:49] <effortDee> mooncup, do you know what your name is?
[04:11:44] <effortDee> so i have .toggle being used
[04:11:57] <effortDee> and if i upgrade to 1.9 it will be deprecated, but with migrate that will fix it right?
[04:13:30] <Cork> effortDee: .toggle isn't depricated
[04:13:38] <Cork> some of the features of .toggle has though
[04:13:51] <Cork> specifically .toggle where you toggle between functions
[04:14:20] <Cork> effortDee: and yes the jquery-migrate lib adds back all the removed functions
[04:14:36] <Cork> you should still fix those though
[04:14:53] <Cork> cause the migrate lib is a temporary solution to buy time
[04:15:00] <Cork> it isn't meant as a permanent solution
[04:50:15] <litropy> mydommedelements.find('img').ready( function() { $(this) }) doesn't seem to pass img to $(this).
[04:50:35] <Cork> litropy: ready isn't a function you can use like that
[04:50:44] <Cork> ready is only for $(document)
[04:51:17] <Cork> litropy: you need to use the load evnet
[04:51:20] <Cork> *event
[04:52:41] <litropy> Cork, okay.
[04:54:41] <rzec> is it not possible to use offsetParent() on an element that itself is fixed (it is return the HTML tag but it does have a parent before that that has the position set)?
[04:55:20] <lilalinuxKL> how do I handle $.ajax({error : function(msg) {}}) and tell the caller that the error has been healed?
[04:55:35] <lilalinuxKL> returning true apparently doesn't help
[04:55:56] <rzec> healed?
[04:56:04] <anli> I wish there was an input type="span"
[04:56:17] <anli> Now I need to combine a span and a hidden
[04:56:30] <anli> lol @ big problem
[04:56:40] <Kartagis> anli: put them in a wrapper?
[04:56:47] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: does you mean handled instead of healed?
[04:56:52] <anli> Still there is a "them" in them
[04:57:16] <lilalinuxKL> rzc: well, I get an error that the request couldn't be processed, but that isn't a fatal error, and I want the ajax request to be treated as success
[04:57:44] <lilalinuxKL> rzec: it's handled when the function is called, but I want to treat it as success
[04:58:24] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: what http code is being returned from the ajax request?
[04:58:37] <lilalinuxKL> 500
[04:58:57] <lilalinuxKL> I'm writing a gadget for jira that adds users to groups. the error here is, that the user is already in the group
[04:59:09] <lilalinuxKL> which is fine and should be treated as success
[05:00:32] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: what is the msg value of the error function?
[05:00:59] <lilalinuxKL> "Der Benutzer 'admin' kann nicht hinzugefügt werden. Er ist bereits Mitglied von 'jira-galeria-admin'."
[05:01:11] <lilalinuxKL> The user amdin can't be added. He is already a member of ...
[05:02:57] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: the best thing I can think of is to parse that msg string and if it has the text that related to the user already being a member, handle that in a successful way.
[05:03:40] <rzec> i don't know that context of what your are doingm but I would probably just display the error message to the user and they will not the user is already part of the group
[05:04:59] <lilalinuxKL> rzec: the problem is how to continue AFTER handling the error
[05:05:44] <lilalinuxKL> jira still detects an error
[05:05:51] <lilalinuxKL> no matter if I return true or false
[05:06:18] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: are you talking about return a value in the error callback of the $.ajax?
[05:06:29] <lilalinuxKL> yes
[05:07:22] <lilalinuxKL> I hoped that way I could "heal" the 500
[05:08:50] <rzec> lilalinuxKL: that value is not sent to the request url of the $.ajax.  once the $.ajax returns a value (whether it results in a success or error), it will not try to send another ajax request unless you actually trigger it.
[05:08:57] <lilalinuxKL>  if (options.global !== false) {jQuery.event.trigger("ajaxError", [xhr, options]); }
[05:09:13] <lilalinuxKL> maybe I can set options.global to false
[05:10:31] <lilalinuxKL> works
[05:10:33] <lilalinuxKL> :-)
[05:11:57] <rzec> cool
[05:12:41] <rzec> can someone explain to me why fixed2 offset parent is html instead of fixed1 : http://plnkr.co/edit/pTNxGRPAJquDBdN3PiB8?p=preview ?
[05:19:07] <xec> rzec: that's basically what position: fixed; is - relative to window
[05:19:32] <xec> rzec: maybe you wanted position: absolute; instead?
[05:19:59] <xec> rzec: http://plnkr.co/edit/NTla0ZQOFxTpkNhY23iD?p=preview
[05:20:39] <rzec> xec: yea, your probably right that i should be using absolute
[05:25:52] <Feel> Hello. I can't find jquery method to animate from startvalue to finish value
[05:26:05] <Feel> Somebody know it?
[05:26:24] <helvetet> you mean you want to count from x to y
[05:26:51] <helvetet> and then be able to use the cubic stuff
[05:27:14] <helvetet> Feel: doesnt the step thing do that?
[05:28:15] <Feel> helvetet, yes
[05:29:01] <Feel> helvetet, I want to scroll page from current position to position of target element.
[05:29:31] <helvetet> use scrolltop? and then get the position of target element?
[05:30:22] <helvetet> wait
[05:30:26] <helvetet> thats the wrong one
[05:30:37] <Feel> helvetet, Something like: $(my_element).animate({scrollTop: [from, to]}, time);
[05:30:59] <helvetet> yeah theres a super easy thing to do
[05:31:04] <helvetet> that does just that
[05:31:11] <helvetet> i just cant remember what it is
[05:31:40] <Feel> helvetet, I read about .animate() and didn't find information about from/to animation
[05:31:47] <helvetet> oh wait
[05:32:09] <helvetet> $(my_element).animate({scrollTop: '200px'}, time);
[05:32:13] <helvetet> that scrolls to 200px
[05:32:48] <helvetet> then theres a thing that shows the top posiiton of a specific div from the top in pixels
[05:32:50] <helvetet> thats what you should use
[05:32:54] <Feel> but from 0 to 200px
[05:33:02] <helvetet> oh it does that?
[05:33:15] <Feel> y
[05:34:17] <Feel> Animate works from 0 to target value for scrollTop
[05:36:05] <helvetet> are you sure about it
[05:36:17] <helvetet> cause thats not how its suppose to work
[05:36:44] <helvetet> $(my_element).animate({scrollTop: $(target).offset().top}, time);
[05:36:45] <helvetet> try that
[05:37:25] <helvetet> its suppose to animate from the position you are at
[06:06:13] <gnarf> is something changing the html inside my_element ?
[06:29:05] <zeroquake> any alternatives to .closest and .parents , both are failing in ie8
[06:33:50] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: Which version of jQuery are you using?
[06:34:42] <zeroquake> 1.11
[06:35:06] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: I just looked at the .closest() jQuery page in IE8 and the demos are working.
[06:35:11] <BillCriswell> Though the site looks a little messy.
[06:36:02] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: Yeah. It's working fine here. Must be something else throwing you off.
[06:36:15] <Cork> zeroquake: ie pre 9 can have circular parent tree
[06:36:16] <BillCriswell> Let's hope I never have to open up that evil browser again.
[06:36:24] <Cork> you might be hitting something nasty like that
[06:36:51] <BillCriswell> Oh that sounds fun haha.
[06:36:57] <zeroquake> i jus one statement in my click event , like "$( event.target ).closest( ".some-class" )"
[06:36:58] <Cork> zeroquake: also make sure to validate the html
[06:37:11] <Cork> as older ie can go nuts over invalid html
[06:39:53] <zeroquake> yes , experienced it , dint have one closing div somewhere in middle of page , it blew up whole application
[06:40:57] <helvetet> i know the feeling of supporting ie8
[06:41:12] <Cork> ya, it sucks
[06:41:21] <helvetet> its gotten better with the years though
[06:41:31] <helvetet> about 2 months ago i made a website and i tried it in ie8
[06:41:34] <helvetet> and everything worked
[06:41:37] <helvetet> i was kinda shocked
[06:41:37] <Cork> well ya ie8 is much better then ie6 or even worse ie5
[06:42:15] <Cork> helvetet: you didn't use any semi new features like png then :)
[06:42:29] <Cork> ie8 is still quite horrible
[06:42:35] <Cork> but much less then older versions
[06:42:39] <decx> png is a new feature?
[06:42:52] <Cork> alpha transparency in images is for ie
[06:43:15] <Cork> so ya, png that isn't actually gifs is "a new feature"
[06:43:35] <zeroquake> its not closest , my bad , it is throwing imediately after click event
[06:43:52] <Cork> on binding it?
[06:44:33] <decx> i forgot all about those ridiculous ie png fixes
[06:44:39] <zeroquake> yup i am using something like " $('#someId').find(".some-class").click
[06:44:47] <decx> contenttypes and ugh
[06:45:02] <Cork> zeroquake: and what is the error?
[06:45:10] <zeroquake> object is not supported
[06:45:24] <zeroquake> i am just alerting e.message
[06:45:37] <zeroquake> i dont have a console to look at e object :(
[06:45:47] <Cork> i recognize this
[06:45:53] <Cork> but i don't remember what it was...
[06:46:01] <zeroquake> oh man ..
[06:46:02] <Cork> it was something fairly stupid
[06:46:48] <Cork> zeroquake: btw why $(string).find
[06:46:52] <Cork> why not merge them?
[06:47:15] <zeroquake> it seems .find is faster way then having an id and class in selector
[06:47:25] <Cork> ah, ya ie8
[06:47:38] <Cork> jquery need to tinker to make queries
[06:47:47] <Cork> and pure id selectors becomes faster
[06:47:55] <Cork> forgot that
[06:48:25] <decx> does id.find(class) make a difference on browsers that do querySelector in the back?
[06:48:44] <zeroquake> found it it is event.stopPropagation
[06:49:04] <Cork> decx: depends on what selector you give to .find
[06:49:10] <Cork> decx: but normally no
[06:50:00] <decx> i guess caching the id parent is more convenient anyway in the long run
[06:50:36] <Cork> decx: and if you need to do multiple queries in the same tree
[06:50:39] <zeroquake> yup but it can be dangerous , learnt the hard way yesterday
[06:50:41] <Cork> then ya .find is faster
[06:51:27] <Cork> decx: basically reducing the match area .find need to look in is always a speed gain
[06:51:41] <Cork> the query and dom size specifies how big though
[06:52:11] <Cork> (and sometimes the gain is small enough that readability matters more)
[06:52:11] <decx> well i know that, but i didnt know if querySelector had any benefits for typical css selectors
[06:52:30] <zeroquake> what is simplest way to stop event propagation in ie8
[06:52:38] <Cork> decx: note that most jquery selectors is matched with querySelectorAll
[06:52:43] <Cork> not querySelector
[06:52:44] <decx> alt f4
[06:53:06] <Cork> zeroquake: stopPropagation like other browsers
[06:53:07] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: event.stopPropagation() ?
[06:53:14] <decx> should be all
[06:53:24] <zeroquake> not supported in ie8 ,
[06:53:43] <zeroquake> hmm seems event is not exactly event object in ie8 , it is a windows event it seems .
[06:53:47] <Cork> huh...
[06:53:57] <Cork> interesting i've totally forgotten that
[06:54:06] <Cork> zeroquake: so return false from the event handler i guess
[06:54:07] <decx> ya ie8 has window.event
[06:54:10] <zeroquake> yup i need to tell it what event is
[06:54:16] * Cork cries a bit saying that
[06:54:25] <decx> lol
[06:54:31] <zeroquake> lol
[06:55:45] <Cork> i hate return false from events with a vengeance
[06:56:10] <Cork> i've had to fix way to much libs/old code that breaks extendability over the years cause of that
[06:56:32] <decx> well stop being so anticipatory about future requirements then
[06:56:34] <decx> ^^
[06:57:03] <Cork> decx: well it is more about "i don't want to patch this lib to do what i need"
[06:57:19] <Cork> cause they return false from there event handler
[06:57:28] <Cork> so you can't bind an event listener -- AT ALL
[06:57:34] <decx> i know, but you know future me will have to take care of himself
[06:57:40] <decx> fuck that guy
[06:57:51] <Cork> ohh that reminds me
[06:58:22] <Cork> decx: http://xkcd.com/1421/
[06:58:51] <decx> i know these comments all to well
[06:59:06] <decx> i started out as a designer fiddling in js ;)
[06:59:07] <Cork> even the tooltip one? :D
[06:59:13] <stevarino> hey all, quick question: is there a way to load the jquery-ui library with the jquery object not set to the "$" variable?
[06:59:27] <Cork> stevarino: yes
[06:59:34] <Cork> stevarino: it should work just fine without $
[07:00:10] <Cork> stevarino: <script src="jquery.js"></script><script>jQuery.noConflict();</script><script src="jquery-ui.js">
[07:00:19] <stevarino> Cork: I'm trying to use it in a django admin page, where jquery is set to django.jQuery. however if i just load the jquery-ui library, i get console errors without even executing it.
[07:00:46] <Cork> stevarino: window.jQuery HAS to be the jquery instance though
[07:00:58] <Cork> else things break
[07:01:06] <stevarino> Cork: ah, that's my problem. thanks.
[07:01:36] <decx> that django admin page should have its own noconflict already then
[07:01:41] <stevarino> Cork: i guess i'll just have two instances of jquery running, the framework version, and my own version. no big deal really thanks to caching.
[07:01:59] <Cork> stevarino: you should really remove one of those
[07:02:00] <decx> ie var django.jQuery = jQuery.noConflict()
[07:02:35] <Cork> stevarino: loading two versions of jquery is a recipe for future problems
[07:02:44] <Cork> (i know from experience)
[07:02:56] <Cork> did it way back in an old drupal installation once
[07:03:01] <Cork> bit me big time
[07:03:04] <decx> best i've seen was 2 local jquery, jquery migrate and jquery from google cdn
[07:03:37] <Cork> decx: worst i've seen is first jquery 1.0, then jquery 2.5 (i think) then prototype
[07:03:43] <Cork> followed by jquery 3.2
[07:03:50] <Cork> that page was a real mess
[07:03:56] <decx> prototype, that must've been in the 80s
[07:04:01] <stevarino> Cork: I'll look into that, i'm just curious why the django group chose to namespace out jquery
[07:04:02] <Cork> lol
[07:04:22] <Cork> stevarino: to not conflict with the page most likely
[07:04:28] <Cork> it's a bad idea if you ask me
[07:04:45] <Cork> decx: ya, like js existed in the 90s
[07:04:50] <Cork> *80
[07:04:57] <decx> how did they get away with prototype as a name anyway
[07:05:06] <decx> i actually enjoyed that graphics framework
[07:05:11] <Cork> how did they get away with anything
[07:05:18] <Cork> prototype is a horrible framework
[07:05:34] <decx> i dont think that visualization prototype still exists
[07:06:09] <Cork> scriptaculous?
[07:06:25] <Cork> sure it does https://script.aculo.us/
[07:06:36] <decx> na it wasnt web related
[07:07:03] <decx> there was this graphics framework to make demoscene stuff
[07:07:08] <Cork> scriptaculous is to prototype what jquery ui is to jquery
[07:07:19] <Cork> ah, that one
[07:07:40] <Cork> boy i barely remember that one
[07:07:46] <decx> i thought it was also named prototype but i cant find a reference
[07:08:21] <zeroquake> im newbie with error handling
[07:08:44] <zeroquake> event.stopPropagation -- i check if it exists
[07:09:03] <zeroquake> which would throw an exception , do i jus ignore with try , catch ?
[07:09:42] <Cork> zeroquake: if(event.stopPropagation === undefined) { return false; } else { event.stopPropagation(); }
[07:10:05] <decx> dont forget var event = event || window.event
[07:10:06] <Cork> or actually you can lose the else
[07:10:14] <Cork> zeroquake: if(event.stopPropagation === undefined) { return false; } event.stopPropagation();
[07:11:01] <Cork> decx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UYOsgD6hVY
[07:11:41] <decx> drum&bass, it's like 2001 all over again
[07:11:42] <Cork> or if you prefer http://ada.untergrund.net/?p=demo&i=717
[07:13:08] <zeroquake> perfect , worked , thanks :)
[07:13:33] <decx> my favorite demo from the last few years was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg
[07:13:48] <decx> 177kb executable
[07:16:07] <zeroquake> why do i need -- event = event || window.event ??  - --> it is anyway returning false if event doesnt exist
[07:16:23] <frank_o> you guys on soundcloud? if so add me and let's be friends: https://soundcloud.com/frankaay88
[07:16:39] <decx> i vaguely remember that from ie8 stuff zeroquake
[07:17:44] <zeroquake> yup event is in window.event for ie8 but as cork code above , even if event is undefined , it returns false , thus stop propagation
[07:18:14] <stevarino> Cork, decx: thank you both for your help. I found this http://www.lokkju.com/blog/archives/143 which i was able to adjust for my purposes.
[07:19:01] <decx> a wrapped noconflict, notbad ^^
[07:20:07] <zeroquake> another interesting bit -- only for jquery event handlers return false would stop eventbubbling not for normal js ones
[08:11:08] <Andrew__> hello
[08:30:56] <bobbry> hello, can someone help me understand a jquery behavior?
[08:31:26] <bobbry> i have an element on a page that im cloning, and then updating the ID
[08:31:44] <bobbry> the element is a form
[08:32:12] <bobbry> upon submitting the form, all of the fields work as intended except for the required checkbox
[08:32:49] <bobbry> im using firefox 28
[08:33:13] <bobbry> is this a bug? or is it that cloning an element and changing it's ID has funny behavior
[08:33:24] <bobbry> should i send code?
[08:36:28] <hlvwrk> bobbry no. you can just talk about hypothetical code that we can't debug or see. :)
[08:37:17] <bobbry> actually in the process of pastebinning the code, i see the problem =D
[08:37:29] <bobbry> hlvwrk thanks for the cheeky comment though
[08:38:40] <hlvwrk> :P
[08:42:05] <Grundell> So im working on a site that my clients wants to showcase... though he only wants to showcase a single page here. so i thaught of having this script that exchanges all the links within the href="" tag to a Hash and adds a modal box with a firendly message
[08:42:33] <Grundell> Though how do i remove the contents within href=" THIS CONTENT " with jquery ?
[08:42:51] <robertmaxrees> .prop('href', 'newStuffHEre')
[08:42:58] <robertmaxrees> but if i disable js, i can bypass that.
[08:45:14] <Grundell> Well that won't be a problem, don't think his clients will be that good at computing
[08:45:22] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.
[08:45:26] <Grundell> Thanks :)
[08:45:28] <robertmaxrees> full disclosure and all that ;)
[08:46:27] <robertmaxrees> the other way to do it would be to do something like $('a').on('click', function(e) { e.stopImmediatePropagation() });
[08:46:43] <robertmaxrees> though that'll break anything that relies on delegation
[08:50:56] <Grundell> Okay
[08:51:35] <Grundell> Since i use wordpress i thaught that i do a modal from wordpress with a little message from me :)
[08:52:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that has to do with wordpress haha
[08:52:46] <robertmaxrees> no idea why you need a modal, either tbh
[08:52:48] <Grundell> sorry bootstap
[08:53:03] <Grundell> Because i want to give a nice message in a nice way :)
[08:53:21] <Grundell> though i could use a alert
[08:53:25] <Grundell> but not so nice
[08:53:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd just prevent any interaction.  no need for messagint - that's when things break.
[08:53:34] <robertmaxrees> *messaging
[08:59:33] <callumacrae> Heya! I'm trying to forward events from one input to another, and struggling
[08:59:46] <robertmaxrees> D: that's a scary idea.
[08:59:51] <callumacrae> So if I type in one element, I effectively want exactly the same input and events in two elements
[09:00:14] <callumacrae> Yeah I want input formatting, but a numerical keyboard. filter="[0-9]+" only works on iOS
[09:00:18] <robertmaxrees> can you share a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do?
[09:00:30] <callumacrae> Experiementing with putting a transparent number input over a text input
[09:00:30] <callumacrae> sure
[09:00:37] <callumacrae> http://codepen.io/callumacrae/pen/HFopj
[09:00:47] <callumacrae> lol parse error
[09:00:54] <callumacrae> try again
[09:01:24] <robertmaxrees> so what's your overall goal here?
[09:01:37] <Respek> I have a problem where I'm trying to create an effect where depending on the section of the page, I'd like to add the hover effect to the sub menu. No idea how I'd remove the class upon entering a new section though, http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/7pfdetsh/
[09:01:39] <callumacrae> For the text typed into #number to appear in #text
[09:01:58] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae okay - that part is easy.  what's this about events?
[09:02:01] <callumacrae> Using this library for the input formatting, which is fucked up and confusing:; https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment/blob/master/src/jquery.payment.coffee
[09:02:17] <callumacrae> If I just set the value, that library won't format it
[09:02:29] <robertmaxrees> let's hold off on that part for now.
[09:02:52] <callumacrae> It listens to the keypress event, but does loads of stuff like checking meta keys, and won't work unless it's an actual jQuery event (e.g. I can't just set the input and call .keypress())
[09:03:33] <robertmaxrees> to back this up a little more - why are you doing all this?
[09:04:02] <callumacrae> See demo of that library
[09:04:02] <callumacrae> https://stripe.github.io/jquery.payment/example/
[09:04:11] <callumacrae> I want that functionality, but I want a numerical keyboard on mobile devices
[09:04:25] <callumacrae> For iOS, I can use a filter attribute on the input to set the keyboard to numerical
[09:04:34] <callumacrae> That doesn't work on Android, though
[09:04:42] <robertmaxrees> Respek just do $('.custom-hoverTransition').removeClass("custom-hoverTransition") before your addclass.
[09:04:45] <callumacrae> I can't use type="number", because of the formatting
[09:04:49] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae aaaah....
[09:05:38] <Respek> robertmaxrees: you're a wealth of knowledge, I look forward to the day I get to buy you a beer
[09:05:42] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae you'll need to set up a bunch of custom event capturing/triggering/data stuff.  that's going to be difficult.
[09:05:47] <Respek> or whatever your preferred libation it
[09:05:48] <Respek> *is
[09:06:04] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of any simple way to do it sadly.
[09:06:17] <callumacrae> Great fun
[09:06:20] <robertmaxrees> Respek haha i appreciate it :) and it's definitely beer.
[09:06:27] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae i don't envy you atm haha
[09:06:56] <callumacrae> I wish jquery.payment wasn't written in coffeescript, I'm not very good at reading it :(
[09:07:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah... i'd go with another library at this point haha
[09:07:26] <callumacrae> We're using stripe, makes more sense to use their library
[09:07:30] <callumacrae> Plus, most of the other ones suck
[09:07:40] <robertmaxrees> aaah that's why.
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> wonder if SlexAxton could help you with that :)
[09:08:39] <SlexAxton> everyone at stripe these days agrees
[09:08:45] <SlexAxton> probably won't happen any time soon though
[09:08:49] <SlexAxton> it works well enough as is
[09:09:24] <robertmaxrees> this dude's trying to use it on IOS but using type=number for it, which is causing headaches?  he can probably explain it better.
[09:09:37] <callumacrae> Can't use type=number! That's the point
[09:09:54] <callumacrae> I want the effect of using type=number, but I can't actually use it because it won't let you put spaces in them
[09:11:29] <callumacrae> Basically, numerical keyboard on android with a formatted input
[09:11:31] <callumacrae> It's tricky
[09:11:59] <robertmaxrees> that's way tricky.  maybe do numerican input and then format on blur or something?
[09:12:04] <robertmaxrees> *numerical
[09:12:37] <callumacrae> That won't do
[09:13:15] <wormmd> Does jquery handle session cookies transparently? I.e. if the server sends a session cookie in the response to a post, and I later put to the server, will the session cookie get sent?
[09:13:36] <nonconvergent> What's $(function($) {}); wrapped around some things for?
[09:13:41] <callumacrae> wormmd: yes
[09:13:48] <nonconvergent> I see it in my team's project, still learning.
[09:13:50] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent that's a shorthand for $(document).ready()
[09:13:51] <wormmd> callumacrae: that is so fancy.
[09:13:59] <callumacrae> nonconvergent: It's a shortcut for $(document).ready(function(){})
[09:14:20] <callumacrae> wormmd: It's not jquery doing that, it's just hte browser
[09:14:24] <robertmaxrees> which is also the same as $().ready()
[09:14:48] <wormmd> callumacrae: good point.
[09:18:03] <Respek> if console.log($(this)); returns something like, [div#aboutus-whoweare.et_pb_section.et_section_regular, context: div#aboutus-whoweare.et_pb_section.et_section_regular, jquery (et cetera) what does it mean?
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> That's all the information about that node
[09:18:35] <robertmaxrees> and the jquery object itself.
[09:18:48] <robertmaxrees> there are tons of properties and methods it inherits because you passed it through jquery.
[09:19:19] <robertmaxrees> and by virtue of being a javascript object, too :D
[09:19:36] <Respek> hmm, so if I followed that with $(this).addClass("custom-hoverTransition"), it would work because it targets that node?
[09:19:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:20:13] <robertmaxrees> if you inspected that element in the DOM explorer, you'd see an addClass() method attached to that object.
[09:21:09] <Respek> **** the more you knoooow ****
[09:23:23] <Aresak> Hello
[09:23:40] <Aresak> I need help with this - I'm not getting output from $(data).text()
[09:23:50] <callumacrae> data === ?
[09:23:58] <Aresak> http://pastebin.com/tvDDrgCr
[09:24:22] <robertmaxrees> because $(data) isn't a node.
[09:25:42] <Aresak> function(data) {,,,}
[09:25:48] <Aresak> It's defined in a function
[09:26:33] <robertmaxrees> it's the return of the post.
[09:26:40] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the post is returning more than one node.
[09:26:43] <Aresak> yeah
[09:26:50] <Aresak> Well
[09:26:57] <robertmaxrees> so the collective text is likely not the string 'true'
[09:27:05] <robertmaxrees> console.log(data); in that handler to see what's coming back.
[09:29:12] <Aresak> @robertmaxrees I have debug here addLog("Alien>$registerResult: " + $(data).text());
[09:29:21] <Aresak> It's returning a html
[09:30:31] <Aresak> The text wasn't in the #o
[09:31:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to show you the actual object, but ok.
[09:47:30] <xckpd7> question... I want to use (this) inside of my modularly coded application, but sometimes I struggle because "this" changes. is there a resource for best practices on this?
[09:48:06] <xckpd7> I know you can use proxy, and cache "this" before the meaning of "this" changes but it just strikes me as messy
[09:48:39] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[09:49:09] <robertmaxrees> what are you tackling right now?
[09:51:57] <xckpd7> alright I'll code up an example
[09:51:59] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/qhgc9jjc/4/
[09:52:15] <robertmaxrees> because the "best practices" are all about understanding the rules behind `this` and how you want to tackle with how it changes :)
[09:52:22] <xckpd7> so take that. Basically you have an object, and neatly organized funcions & objects
[09:52:57] <xckpd7> notice how I'm using this.clickHandlers() rather than App.clickHandlers()
[09:53:03] <robertmaxrees> sure
[09:53:28] <xckpd7> right. but let's say I want to use "this", but I'm inside a click function
[09:53:54] <xckpd7> there are many instances where "this* in a 1,000 line application isn't going to refer to "App". How do people get around this?
[09:54:05] <xckpd7> or is what I'm trying to do unnormal?
[09:54:30] <robertmaxrees> nah i totally get what you're doing.
[09:54:44] <robertmaxrees> you can control the context of `this` yourself actually.
[09:54:54] <robertmaxrees> i recently did something exactly like that.  one sec.
[09:55:27] <xckpd7> I know you can, before the event or whatever, do like $this = this... but that just seems messy
[09:55:27] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('change', 'input', bigObject.thingChange.bind(bigObject));
[09:55:47] <robertmaxrees> var $this = $(this) is actually done for a variety of reasons.
[09:55:58] <xckpd7> ignoring caching
[09:56:11] <robertmaxrees> that also doesn't fix the case you're talking about.
[09:56:23] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: it should
[09:56:35] <robertmaxrees> not within your event handler...
[09:56:40] <naeluh> howdy
[09:56:45] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: I'll give an example
[09:56:47] <robertmaxrees> also, you can instead look at the $(event.target) when looking at jquery elements in your handlers.
[09:57:18] <robertmaxrees> i totally get where you're coming from though.  it feels awkward.  you have a few options, though.
[09:57:37] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/qhgc9jjc/5/
[09:57:49] <xckpd7> this is what I've traditionally done. I also know jquery proxy exists
[09:58:05] <xckpd7> but I have to wonder if people are actually coding / encapsulating their code like I'm trying to do or what
[09:58:19] <robertmaxrees> var $this = this; only creates a new variable that is the same as the `this` object - that doesn't preserve context at all.
[09:58:27] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[09:58:30] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're getting at.
[09:58:33] <Respek> I was getting an error (referencing mutable variable from closure) on the last alink variable, here  http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/yp9qbtz7/ so I did some research on it and changed it to this, http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/yp9qbtz7/1/ but tbh I only have a vague idea on why. Does anyone have an english version of why the error disappeared?
[09:58:34] <xckpd7> yeah you see
[09:58:42] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to pass `this` to child functions.
[09:58:50] <xckpd7> yup
[09:59:04] <robertmaxrees> you can use .bind() and .call() to preserve context the way you want.
[09:59:19] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('change', 'input', bigObject.thingChange.bind(bigObject));
[09:59:50] <xckpd7> hmm that's confusing. how would I do it within my exaple
[09:59:53] <xckpd7> *example
[10:00:18] <xckpd7> so like $('a').click(bind(
[10:00:20] <xckpd7> something like that
[10:00:34] <robertmaxrees>  $('form').on('click', bigObject.thingChange.bind(bigObject));
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of just calling the handler directly -  $('form').on('click', bigObject.thingChange);
[10:01:03] <robertmaxrees> you have to explicitly .bind() it to maintain context.
[10:01:12] <robertmaxrees> but now the `this` object won't refer to the node that was clicked.
[10:01:53] <robertmaxrees> so instead of you have to pass the event object explicitly to your handlers and use $(event.target) for those.
[10:02:19] <Kartagis> by "handle", we mean the icon with four arrows used to click on and drag a div, no?
[10:02:33] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis depends on context?
[10:03:08] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-handle
[10:03:43] <robertmaxrees> they mean that dragging won't happen unless it's on a specific element within your element.
[10:04:29] <Kartagis> hm, in this case, a h2?
[10:04:39] <robertmaxrees> in that first example, yeah
[10:04:55] <w00tb3ast> I have a JSON response like data = {"type":"Success","message":"Image uploaded successfully","success":true} do I do something like console.log(data.message)?
[10:05:08] <Kartagis> I looked at helper too (Cork told me) but it didn't work either
[10:05:28] <robertmaxrees> w00tb3ast yep.
[10:05:48] <w00tb3ast> orly? ok I will try it again but last time I got undefined
[10:07:45] <robertmaxrees> w00tb3ast http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3kL7r0vr/
[10:08:19] <w00tb3ast> Hmm
[10:08:48] <robertmaxrees> make sure that scope isn't biting you.
[10:09:26] <w00tb3ast> One sec trying it now
[10:09:59] <w00tb3ast> Perfect!! Thanks for that!
[10:10:22] <Respek> robertmaxrees: strikes again :)
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> xckpd7 this is a little contrived, but should illustrate the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cny2oo4f/1/
[10:26:05] <Respek> I was getting an error (referencing mutable variable from closure) on the last alink variable, here  http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/yp9qbtz7/ so I did some research on it and changed it to this, http://jsfiddle.net/Gabrielmtn/yp9qbtz7/1/ it got rid of the error, but I can't really say I learned anything from it (also the script isn't working yet but I'd like to learn what was going on first)
[10:26:48] <robertmaxrees> Respek woah uh you know const isn't really supported fully right?
[10:27:07] <Respek> oh jeez no I didn't
[10:27:13] <Respek> well crap, back to sq 1
[10:27:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no constancts.
[10:27:16] <robertmaxrees> *constants
[10:27:24] <robertmaxrees> also, for loops and ifs don't create scope.
[10:27:27] <robertmaxrees> functions do.
[10:27:41] <plong0> hello, I am replacing a table with a newly created table (using $(‘#oldTable’).replaceWith(newTable) )… the trouble I have is that elements I have set val() on in the new table do not seem to keep when the newTable gets rendered.  However, if I use .attr(‘value’, myValue) they do keep…
[10:27:48] <Respek> so where
[10:28:05] <Respek> 's the issue? why the error?
[10:28:40] <Respek> if it says referencing mutable variable from closure, doesn't that have something to do with scope?
[10:28:53] <robertmaxrees> what says that?
[10:29:43] <pootpoot> hello, i'm animating the page scrolling via $('html,body').animate.... but the problem is the complete event function fires twice (i assume because html,body)
[10:29:47] <pootpoot> any way to only get it to run once?
[10:30:10] <Respek> the IDE has an error when I build it the original way which says mutable variable is accessible from closure.
[10:30:40] <robertmaxrees> what variable?
[10:31:05] <Respek> line 22 alink and line 25 alink get the same alert
[10:31:26] <xckpd7> is there anyway to get $(event.target) to be similar to $(this)?
[10:31:39] <robertmaxrees> xckpd7 it's basically the same thing :)
[10:31:47] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: right but it's not
[10:32:18] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: if there is a span inside of an anchor and you click on the span (but the handler was on the anchor), this will give you the anchor you clicked on
[10:32:27] <xckpd7> but $(event.target) will give you the span
[10:32:39] <robertmaxrees> right, because that's what you bound the event to.
[10:32:47] <robertmaxrees> oh derp.
[10:33:23] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: I'm really trying to figure out a way to be inside of a click handler and have access to the original this, and the new this
[10:33:30] <xckpd7> without doing var self = this
[10:33:41] <robertmaxrees> er, you want a way to pass scope around
[10:33:47] <decx> }.bind(this)
[10:33:53] <robertmaxrees> check out .call() and .bind()
[10:34:00] <robertmaxrees> those are your only real options at this point.
[10:34:03] <xckpd7> yeah but that changes the context though
[10:34:08] <xckpd7> I don't have access to the original context
[10:34:11] <robertmaxrees> and structure your code so you're not creating closures the way you are right now.
[10:34:43] <robertmaxrees> Respek i'd swap out that for for an .each() btw.
[10:34:52] <robertmaxrees> because in this case you actually want the jquery objects.
[10:35:56] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: tbh I don't know what you mean. I'll keep looking
[10:36:00] <Respek> and I don't get them b/c it's for?
[10:36:50] <robertmaxrees> xckpd7 you're unnecessarily creating functions in functions.  the way you're approaching your problem lends itself to not do that.
[10:37:08] <robertmaxrees> Respek you're basically trying to emulate an .each() right now - try using that instead and see if that doesn't fix your problem.
[10:37:24] <Respek> I will try
[10:37:40] <decx> how do you emulate each?
[10:37:42] <xckpd7> creating functions in functions....
[10:38:19] <Respek> I'm a little lost myself decx, but I'm going to try to do the research on it
[10:38:30] <decx> oh i see the fiddle
[10:38:40] <robertmaxrees> decx they're doing a for loop to enumerate through a jquery object, then creating a new jquery object to work off of inside of that.
[10:38:47] <robertmaxrees> *iterate through, rather
[10:38:59] <decx> "they"
[10:39:03] <robertmaxrees> he
[10:39:06] <robertmaxrees> whatever.
[10:39:08] <decx> i hate that pc bs
[10:39:09] <decx> ^^
[10:39:10] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: can you explain to me what you mean by "unnecessariyl creating functions inside of functions"
[10:39:13] <robertmaxrees> meh, i don't.
[10:39:35] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[10:39:37] <robertmaxrees> xckpd7 not sure what isn't clear.
[10:40:20] <Respek> decx: not really the place, but what does being pc do to you? If I haven't established my gender, which is non-binary btw, why shouldn't he use they? I'll take my answer off the air
[10:40:24] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to provide separations of concern, but you're creating methods that have anonymous functions in them - $('thing').click(function() {}); <- this uses an anonymous function.
[10:40:48] <decx> Respek no girls on the internet means that it doesn't matter because we're all equals
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you guys could take that to PM i'd appreciate it :)
[10:41:19] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: what's the feature I'm talking about called?
[10:41:24] <Respek> I appreciate your opinion decx, but ought to stick to working on this problem for now
[10:41:25] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis what feature?
[10:41:55] <Respek> lol I have to work harder because I'm such a noob
[10:42:01] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> takes time getting used to all the methods and stuff available to you.
[10:42:15] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: the little icon with 4 arrows we use to click on and drag an element
[10:42:24] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: yeah I'm not too advanced so some of what you're saying is going over my head. ok so I'm using anonymous functions... so I should make separate functions
[10:42:30] <Respek> yeah, I feel like I'm constantly out of my depth
[10:42:47] <robertmaxrees> xckpd7 you should probably read up on scope and functions and stuff to understand some of this.
[10:43:13] <robertmaxrees> you're basically starting to move towards a style that does a great job of separating out concerns, but you're only halfway there, so you're getting bitten by stuff.
[10:43:32] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis it's an icon? not sure what the name for it is or anything.
[10:43:57] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: alright, that makes a lot more sense. any source / book / whatever you recommend me looking at?
[10:44:11] <robertmaxrees> MDN
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> javascript: the definitive guide.  javascript: the good parts.  eloquent javascript is well liked, too.
[10:44:46] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: something like https://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&docid=mC47ILguo5i5uM&tbnid=tYsZl-lwST8NUM:&ved=0CAcQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clker.com%2Fclipart-267098.html&ei=7aUlVLm0O-OaygO-74LgDg&bvm=bv.76247554,d.bGQ&psig=AFQjCNGBZjZ14Dxbuc_WCzAZVkVT-olokA&ust=1411839858454015
[10:45:06] <Respek> xckpd7: http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/#function.scopes
[10:45:08] <Kartagis> http://www.clker.com/cliparts/4/6/4/0/1366372642618206975Cursor_Drag_Arrow.svg.med.png rather
[10:45:29] <Kartagis> like this, but much much smaller
[10:45:48] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis again, I don't know what the specific name is for it.
[10:45:55] <Kartagis> okay
[11:33:59] <bobbyr> hello
[11:34:07] <bobbyr> what is the proper way to clone checkbox elements
[11:34:31] <bobbyr> when i clone a checkbox, i've noticed that the clones dont respond to click
[11:36:11] <robertmaxrees> that'
[11:36:18] <robertmaxrees> *that's not a cloning issue.
[11:36:22] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[11:36:34] <bobbyr> can you explain what you mean?
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('change', 'input', function() {});
[11:37:17] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on(), but basically you want to use event delegation to handle those instead of binding directly to the elements
[11:38:25] <bobbyr> one second, lemme share the code
[11:38:30] <xckpd7> is there a reason that "this" would be defined as window in an anonymous self invoking function?
[11:38:42] <bobbyr> im using on click to fire off the cloning function
[11:39:07] <bobbyr> the cloned element works fine except for the checkbox, which doesnt respond to user input
[11:42:22] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: That's what this is when it's like.. not being called from something? I'm terrible at words.
[11:43:34] <robertmaxrees> he means an IIFE (function() {})();
[11:43:53] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I understood that part haha.
[11:43:54] <robertmaxrees> bobbyr yeah some code would be neat.
[11:44:05] <robertmaxrees> this is window becauce that's the context of it.
[11:44:12] <BillCriswell> There we go.
[11:44:13] <robertmaxrees> `this` is a funky problem.
[11:44:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: memorised “this`”.
[11:44:24] <robertmaxrees> !this
[11:44:29] <robertmaxrees> ?this
[11:44:42] <robertmaxrees> !this`
[11:44:42] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: a funky problem.
[11:45:06] <hlvwrk> lol
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha, woops.  anyway, xckpd7 they're technically not self-invoking - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ is a great article about the subject.
[11:46:09] <bobbyr> damn, this is hard
[11:46:21] <bobbyr> all of my markup is generated by a templating system
[11:46:26] <bobbyr> do you need the markup too?
[11:46:28] <robertmaxrees> just copy the generated stuff.
[11:46:33] <robertmaxrees> or just show me the JS
[11:46:52] <bobbyr> http://jsfiddle.net/svn7cmsb/
[11:47:27] <robertmaxrees> so which thing isn't working?
[11:49:20] <xckpd7> robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:49:23] <bobbyr> so the elements get copied
[11:49:48] <bobbyr> but when the form is submitted, the checkbox values are always the same as the copied element
[11:49:55] <bobbyr> regardless of the user input
[11:50:11] <bobbyr> im trying to get you a better example in jsfiddle, gimme a sec
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.  because something here seems... off.
[11:54:18] <MikeD_> what's the correct way to set a <select>  when you know the option value?
[11:55:04] <BrangThang> How can I get Object name in jquery?
[11:55:22] <BrangThang> I have this in console log: "Object {name: "blah" }
[11:55:35] <BrangThang> I wish to get "blah" from current object, is there a method?
[11:55:42] <bobbyr> http://jsfiddle.net/svn7cmsb/
[11:55:45] <bobbyr> ok here we go
[11:55:50] <MikeD_> objref.name
[11:56:10] <BrangThang> I tried
[11:56:25] <MikeD_> how did you get that object displayed in the console?
[11:56:26] <BrangThang> and it works :)
[11:56:37] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees: I guess the problem is that the ID is getting copied?
[12:01:26] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees: so basically what this code does is take the last form in a given div, and increment it's id
[12:02:03] <bobbyr> when i submit the form, all of the values are what they should be except for the checkbox
[12:04:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry was away for a sec.
[12:04:51] <robertmaxrees> err, that's the same code, bobbyr
[12:05:29] <bobbyr> http://jsfiddle.net/svn7cmsb/1/
[12:05:35] <bobbyr> sorry, i dont beleive that i updated
[12:05:58] <bobbyr> just checked, that one works
[12:07:21] <bobbyr> by the way, thank you very much for taking the time to review this code robertmaxrees
[12:12:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry one ssec.
[12:14:45] <Paradisee> hello o/
[12:16:10] <robertmaxrees> so bobbyr why are you cloning instead of just creating new elements?
[12:17:21] <robertmaxrees> that's the first question.  the second question - what does your submit logic look like?
[12:18:25] <MikeD_> .attr("selected",true)  ?
[12:18:39] <robertmaxrees> use .prop()
[12:19:03] <bobbyr> ok so for cloning vs adding
[12:19:10] <MikeD_> why use prop() ?
[12:19:18] <bobbyr> clone allows me to keep my clientside separate from my serverside
[12:19:21] <robertmaxrees> it edits DOM properties instead of the markup.
[12:19:26] <bobbyr> im using code to generate the forms
[12:19:26] <robertmaxrees> DOM properties are the important part.
[12:19:37] <robertmaxrees> bobbyr that's... not really a good way to do that imo.
[12:19:49] <robertmaxrees> use a templating system or something else if that's what you want.
[12:19:58] <robertmaxrees> cloning like that is going to lead to headaches.
[12:20:14] <robertmaxrees> also - use .prop() instead of .attr() everywhere - give that a shot, too.
[12:20:23] <bobbyr> ok
[12:20:27] <bobbyr> ill try that first
[12:20:44] <bobbyr> if that doesnt work ill try just creating an all new element
[12:26:03] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees so cloning is bad because of IDs?
[12:26:05] <bobbyr> im a js newb
[12:26:22] <robertmaxrees> cloning in this case is bad because you're using inputs./
[12:26:30] <robertmaxrees> and doesn't do what you think it does
[12:26:41] <robertmaxrees> also, it screws with bindings and stuff.
[12:26:47] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, IDs can be a problem, too.
[12:27:05] <robertmaxrees> plus it's implicit, which always looks funky to me.
[12:29:38] <masu> are there any plugins that allow me to have two lists, and drag and drop an item from one list to another
[12:29:56] <masu> likedrag and drop a list item from one list to another
[12:30:06] <paxmania> anyone want to help out a newb?
[12:33:27] <MikeD_> !ask
[12:33:27] <b-ot> MikeD_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:37:50] <openyk> trying to upgrade legacy v1.8 jstree to v1.1, due diligence hours have been spent
[12:38:06] <openyk> I come here as a last resort before defenestrating
[12:39:24] <bobbyr> robertmaxrees, thanks for the help
[12:39:32] <bobbyr> would something like this work?
[12:39:32] <bobbyr> $("#selector").clone().prop({ id: "newId", name: "newName"});
[12:39:55] <MikeD_> if you're planning on defenestrating, any resort you go to might be your last resort
[12:40:08] <bobbyr> i was thinking perhaps i could gather all the data i need to build the element first, then clone?
[12:40:58] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/4nLzmh67/
[12:41:06] <openyk> The docs make it so basic and clear
[12:41:20] <openyk> But then the perfect storm of potholes and ambiguity
[12:41:44] <openyk> Getting potholed on an otherwise beautiful path really sucks
[12:41:51] <NoiseEee> bobbyr: try it and see?
[12:42:06] <bobbyr> will do
[12:42:11] <bobbyr> ill let you know
[12:42:15] <bobbyr> how that goes =D
[12:42:41] <NoiseEee> bobbyr: my bet is you'd have to do two separate .prop() calls
[12:42:44] <MikeD_> openyk: did you see the error in the console?
[12:43:25] <bobbyr> NoiseEee why do you suppose that?
[12:43:45] <NoiseEee> bobbyr: i don't see anywhere in the docs where .prop() takes an object
[12:44:08] <openyk> yeah I saw the console error. says the "beforesend" and "onselect" things are being taken by jstree as elements...
[12:44:34] <openyk> what's worse is that there's data inside data inside what makes no sense in pothole of docs
[12:45:19] <MikeD_> fix syntax errors first
[12:45:21] <openyk> to be clear, the key confusion is how to make an ajax call properly within the jstree function and get jstree to read the data from server properly
[12:45:46] <bobbyr> damn you're right, i don tsee it in the API docs either
[12:46:05] <openyk> the problem is I dont know the syntax
[12:46:49] <openyk> the legacy functions are otherwise functional, conceptually
[12:47:13] <MikeD_> openyk: line 12 has beforesend: function...  but you're just inside the open curly of the function definted for 'data'
[12:48:19] <openyk> which means?
[12:48:47] <MikeD_> i think it means you have nicked an { }
[12:49:47] <MikeD_> or are missing an extra $.ajax({ inside the data.data function(node) definition
[12:51:34] <MikeD_> line 47 has an extra comma following }
[12:52:38] <openyk> if I remove the function line from the data and do <'data' : {> then beforesend and onselect are ajaxed as post elements
[12:53:08] <openyk> it's confusing because I'd like to just use the standard jquery ajax syntax
[12:53:16] <openyk> but theres no examples with that
[12:53:53] <openyk> and on top of the ajax syntax mystery I need to have proper callbacks so that both directories and files are righteously retrieved from the server
[12:54:38] <MikeD_> it's no mystery that function foo(p1,p2){ property: {etc} } isn't doing what you think it should
[12:55:23] <openyk> yeah the mystery is not so much the legacy code but rather the solution.
[12:55:26] <MikeD_> i suggest making a simpler test case, make that work... then add in the next layer of complexity
[12:55:53] <openyk> yeah I was thinking the same thing. sc1 nostalgia.
[12:56:34] <openyk> I removed everything in data.data
[12:57:24] <openyk> and expectedly in the ajax call the post fields are empty
[12:58:25] <MikeD_> is the data.data function supposed to return something?
[12:58:53] <MikeD_> data : function(node, db){ /* ??? */ return 'foo!'; }
[12:59:14] <openyk> I think data.data is supposed to be the post fields and values for the ajax call
[12:59:46] <MikeD_> what does the spec say?
[12:59:51] <openyk> I put in { 'directory' : '' } for the data.data and the post field/value directory = was in the call
[13:00:12] <openyk> by spec u mean docs? nothing about this specifically.
[13:00:26] <openyk> they only give exampkes displayed here: http://www.jstree.com/docs/json/
[13:00:45] <openyk> and here: http://www.jstree.com/api/#/?f=$.jstree.defaults.core.data
[13:02:23] <murtaza112> hello can someone help me understand why this site is throwing a unknown error in IE http://www.gopicnic.com
[13:02:38] <murtaza112> and how can i debug it.
[13:02:49] <MikeD_> their example of // AJAX has a return { 'id:'node.id } inside it
[13:03:00] <MikeD_> yours has weird stuff
[13:04:41] <murtaza112> mike d are you talking to me?
[13:04:57] <MikeD_> no, openyk
[13:06:16] <openyk> yeah that's true. I updated the jsfiddle to reflect where I am now
[13:07:15] <MikeD_> now i get jstree is not a function
[13:07:52] <openyk> based on the simple test, the server is responding now
[13:08:01] <openyk> but jstree is not taking the response well
[13:08:19] <openyk> the format should be perfect: [{"id":"demo","text":"demo","parent":"demo"}]
[13:08:58] <openyk> but jquery2.0.3 says unrecognized expression o.o
[13:09:24] <NoiseEee> that's an array with a single object
[13:09:32] <NoiseEee> is thats what you want?
[13:10:16] <MikeD_> TypeError: $(...).jstree is not a function
[13:10:20] <openyk> I think so, based on "Using the alternative JSON format" section in http://www.jstree.com/docs/json/
[13:11:10] <openyk> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [{"id":"demo","text":"demo","parent":"demo"}]
[13:11:35] <MikeD_> don't wrap the return in an array
[13:11:47] <MikeD_> just return { ... }
[13:12:26] <MikeD_> nm, i see further down the page
[13:14:27] <openyk> I can try testing without the square brackets
[13:16:34] <openyk> but apparently I dont know how to remove square brackets
[13:26:32] <Paradisee> how can i add the element to the droppable div only if the ajax request has a success status? http://dpaste.com/3RPE00A
[13:40:31] <openyk> damn it all
[13:40:42] <openyk> "guess what's in the box!"
[13:40:55] <openyk> "can you... tell me about what;s in the box?"
[13:41:12] <openyk> "it's black and blue and green and sheen!"
[13:41:34] <openyk> "uh... is it a t-rex?'
[13:41:43] <openyk> 'nope! guess again!'
[13:41:53] <openyk> '<8 damn hours later>
[13:42:07] <openyk> 'how close have my guesses gotten?'
[13:42:18] <openyk> 'you're cold and hot! heehee!'
[13:42:37] <openyk> 'this fucker's messing with my life'
[13:43:50] <Guest76747> can anyone look over a code i wrote and tell me why it isnt working?
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> weee
[13:45:58] <Paradisee> hi robertmaxrees
[13:46:00] <Paradisee> how can i add the element to the droppable div only if the ajax request has a success status? http://dpaste.com/3RPE00A
[13:46:36] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried? :)
[13:47:39] <Paradisee> nothing yet, i was building my 3d printer
[13:48:03] <Paradisee> i think i should put $(this).append(clone); into the .done ajax call
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> Always Tryؑ™
[13:49:59] <Paradisee> how can i fail the request to try?
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> fuck with your server?
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> or modify the URL you're using to be wrong.
[13:58:05] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: sorry i was buying tickets xD
[13:58:37] <Paradisee> btw, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of undefined
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> oh because $(this) won't be the same thing.
[13:59:05] <sR780k> hey - I have an idea but Im not sure what to use to program it, maybe jquery
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> store that in a var, then use that var in the callback.
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> sR780k sup?
[14:00:45] <sR780k> basically is I want to 'edit' a drawing
[14:01:00] <sR780k> x / y axis
[14:01:23] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: $element = $(this).append(clone);
[14:01:25] <Paradisee> this way?
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:01:52] <robertmaxrees> err, no.
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> $element = $(this);
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> then the $element.append(clone);
[14:02:16] <sR780k> within a curve and lines, which have a pretty standard layout but -optional- can be edited a bit. Most importantly, draw colours/boxes in it and add description at the colours
[14:16:16] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: now i can't add the position to the element
[14:16:34] <Paradisee> cus it will display only when the ajax request has success
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:17:07] <Paradisee> and i have to send the position before
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[14:18:06] <Paradisee> probably ive solved it
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> coolio.
[14:21:37] <Paradisee> it doesnt argh
[14:22:58] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/38QPQK0
[14:23:12] <Prometheian> Is jQuery not meant to be able to take $('td > img.class').click()?
[14:23:22] <Prometheian> assuming I put a function in there
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> it totally can.
[14:23:49] <Prometheian> Nvm, my code magically started working yay
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee what's the issue here?
[14:24:14] <Paradisee> it gives always the same position
[14:24:20] <Prometheian> Broken again
[14:24:35] <Paradisee> it is equal to the main element that i usually drag
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee it's pretty hard to figure this out at this point without a functioning example.
[14:24:56] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian does the element in question exist on pageload?
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> or are you doing something else that's unusual?
[14:25:22] <Prometheian> It's set on the page and the selector is setup in document ready ($(function())
[14:25:26] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com <- btw this is a fantastic resourc.e
[14:26:39] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/fxobw1oL/3/
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee did you look at the link i just shot out?
[14:27:17] <Prometheian> Oh, got it sorted. Is there a way to do do .parent('tr')? I have to .parent twice atm
[14:27:31] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian use .closest() instead.
[14:27:49] <Prometheian> ty!
[14:29:07] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: it doesnt give errors.
[14:29:24] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee check out the debugger section.
[14:29:28] <robertmaxrees> that'll help you.
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> you've been asking a lot of the same kinds of questions and learning how to use that will be a big help :)
[14:31:03] <jacargentina> i'm a little lost on this....
[14:31:59] <jacargentina> when i have:  $.Deferred().done( function ( )  {  throw "AN ERROR" } ....)
[14:32:23] <jacargentina> how can i catch that "AN ERROR" to show or log it ?
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> jacargentina https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
[14:33:54] <jacargentina> throw behaviour inside a done() is the same as outside it ?
[14:34:14] <robertmaxrees> it's a callback like any other.
[14:35:59] <robertmaxrees> though why you're throwing errors inside of a done() is kind of... interesting haha
[14:36:19] <jacargentina> not, that was an example
[14:36:42] <jacargentina> if i have a javascript exception ("cant call x on undefined") inside done() how can i get it ?
[14:36:56] <jacargentina> must i put try { } catch {} in every done()  i have ?
[14:37:08] <robertmaxrees> did you read the documentation at all?
[14:37:20] <robertmaxrees> yes, you have to wrap try/catch around any code that might fail
[14:37:23] <shoky> this is why jquery's promises kinda suck :S
[14:37:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:37:34] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[14:37:56] <jacargentina> which other promise implementation is better than jquery?
[14:38:00] <jacargentina> and how is that better ?
[14:38:04] <shoky> most others ;)
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> lol jquery's implementation of promises isn't spec compliant soooo
[14:38:21] <shoky> most other good ones are based on Promises/A+ standard
[14:38:59] <shoky> jacargentina they take care of exactly the problem you're asking about, they propagate errors for you
[14:41:04] <jacargentina> i'm very confused
[14:41:55] <robertmaxrees> lol you're obviously working with javascript :)
[15:00:13] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: how can i remove an element/object created previously?
[15:00:33] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[15:00:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery remove element
[15:00:50] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .remove() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[15:03:16] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i did right
[15:04:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:05:12] <koleS> When I define a custom function to be invoked when ‘click’ event occurs, how do I access the element which fired this event within that function?
[15:05:23] <robertmaxrees> the `this` object is the element.
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> just do $(this) if you want the jquery-fied version.
[15:07:07] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0J51EP1
[15:07:21] <koleS> robertmaxrees: perfect, this is what I needed, thx
[15:07:28] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: this is the element where i drop the items
[15:08:55] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee the `this` object changes depending on the function and invocation.
[15:09:06] <robertmaxrees> you may have to explicitly pass things around like you did before.
[15:10:04] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee have you considered going through learn.jquery.com a time or two0?
[15:10:06] <robertmaxrees> *two
[15:14:48] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: im always there .-.
[15:15:05] <robertmaxrees> you're getting tripped up on lots of the same kinds of issues.
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why i ask.
[15:15:21] <Paradisee> i fixed my code
[15:15:42] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[15:16:27] <Paradisee> now i have to make possible to change position on the json file when you drag and drop the element dropped inside the div :D
[15:28:36] <sR780k> robertmaxrees - is it even possible to have an input 1.0-10 and have a graph out of it displayed?
[15:29:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:29:30] <sR780k> sequence graph
[15:29:38] <sR780k> x/y
[15:29:56] <sR780k> like stats on sound cloud, views of tracks
[15:31:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you'tre asking heh
[15:31:55] <sR780k> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Captcp-time-sequence-graph.png
[15:32:05] <sR780k> this but couldn't find a plainer one
[15:32:16] <sR780k> you get the picture
[15:32:21] <sR780k> litterally
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> heh not really.
[15:32:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to generate a graph out of input data?
[15:32:49] <sR780k> yes :)
[15:32:55] <robertmaxrees> because yeah, there are charting libs out there.
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> can't remember any of them offhand, but they exist.
[15:33:22] <sR780k> in jquery??
[15:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to use canvas to do it.
[15:33:57] <sR780k> wats canvas
[15:34:06] <robertmaxrees> and element that lets you draw picutres and stuff.
[16:06:30] <fila> anyone can help me figure out why click event is not working after i click in INFO [a] "btn" http://bizzarrogroup.com/prv/open-thumbnail.php
[16:08:05] <fila> its only working on for the first time , it added class to show that info of images, but when i click again in that close button, event is not working
[16:21:17] <greggawatt1> hey everyone, is there a good way to get an image overlay like a loading gif over the datepicker calendar while i wait for an ajax call completes to update the calendar
[16:47:34] <robertWorkBeer> helluva week
[16:53:11] <robertWorkBeer> greggawatt1 yes there is - you setup an element that basically covers the area you want and hide/show it whenever you need to.
[16:53:29] <robertWorkBeer> absolutely positioned and everything,
[16:53:44] <greggawatt1> ok i was trying that, with a zindex
[16:54:55] <enav> hello people
[16:55:15] <enav> is there a way to detect when a page is comming back from history?
[16:57:18] <robertWorkBeer> enav not sure what you mean.
[16:57:30] <enav> well
[16:58:56] <enav> lets say i got page A and i click on a link, then im at page B, if i press the back button i get to A almost instantly because the page is cached, I did a test and i see the dom ready event is fired in both cases but i wonder is there is a way to detect that i get back to A after pressing the back button
[17:01:01] <robertWorkBeer> why would that matter?
[17:23:43] <MrDigital_> my script runs in console
[17:23:47] <MrDigital_> but on page load
[17:24:08] <MrDigital_> any ideas?
[17:24:11] <robertWorkBeer> hrm?
[17:24:16] <robertWorkBeer> but on page load what?
[17:24:47] <MrDigital_> when the page is loaded
[17:24:58] <MrDigital_> the script modifes css for a span tag
[17:25:07] <MrDigital_> in short
[17:25:22] <robertWorkBeer> !paste @ MrDigital_
[17:25:23] <b-ot> MrDigital_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:25:23] <MrDigital_> i am modifying html code displayed by a javascript
[17:26:18] <MrDigital_> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=0uz0JBjMjt
[17:26:30] <MrDigital_> not quite sure what much help that would be as thats not the same enviorment
[17:26:51] <MrDigital_> holdon
[17:27:20] <robertWorkBeer> $( "span[id|='as-container']" ) give these elements a class and select on that instead btw.
[17:29:21] <MrDigital_> huh?
[17:29:28] <MrDigital_> the line i need to modify is
[17:29:41] <robertWorkBeer> attribute selectors are really slow, so we generally advise people to not use them.
[17:30:50] <MrDigital_> <span id="as-container-141177738575128" style="width: 242px; height: 24px; display: inline-block; position: relative; z-index: 99999; vertical-align: middle;">
[17:31:00] <MrDigital_> that line is added to page after it loads via a JS
[17:31:12] <MrDigital_> i need to remove the display attribute
[17:31:21] <MrDigital_> ottherwise doesn't look correct on my site
[17:31:43] <robertWorkBeer> do it on $(window).on('load', function() {}); insteadl.
[17:31:43] <MrDigital_> that line i posted works after page is loaded via chrome's console
[17:31:46] <robertWorkBeer> *instead.
[17:31:54] <MrDigital_> i think i tried that
[17:31:58] <MrDigital_> ill try again just to be sure
[17:32:22] <robertWorkBeer> because if that doesn't work, that means you've got another issue.
[17:33:14] <MrDigital_> $(window).on('load', function() {$( "span[id|='as-container']" ).css( "display", "");});    is that correct?
[17:33:57] <robertWorkBeer> yep.
[17:35:19] <MrDigital_> robertWorkBeer:  doesn't work
[17:35:27] <robertWorkBeer> are you able to share the page you're using?
[17:35:53] <MrDigital_> hmmmm yes i can let me make you a login and a fake order
[17:35:56] <robertWorkBeer> because that means there's another issue at play.
[17:36:01] <robertWorkBeer> oh, no need to worry in that case.
[17:36:30] <MrDigital_> any ideas?
[17:37:27] <robertWorkBeer> dunno what your use case is, but it sounds like the stuff in question was designed to be used a very specific way.
[17:37:31] <robertWorkBeer> check to make sure your page is valid.
[17:37:35] <robertWorkBeer> etc.
[17:37:48] <MrDigital_> would you like to look at the page?
[17:37:58] <robertWorkBeer> if it requires you to make a login, nah.
[17:38:11] <robertWorkBeer> i get weird about that kind of stuff heh
[17:38:12] <MrDigital_> do you have teamviewer?
[17:38:18] <robertWorkBeer> nope.
[17:38:27] <MrDigital_> why would it work in console
[17:38:30] <MrDigital_> and not on the page ?
[17:38:41] <robertWorkBeer> because it's getting added after you think it is.
[17:38:46] <robertWorkBeer> or the code on the page never actually runs.
[17:39:08] <MrDigital_> why could that be?
[17:39:23] <robertWorkBeer> try to console.log($( "span[id|='as-container']")) and see if you even see it run
[17:40:12] <MrDigital_> but that where in the script part or console?
[17:40:18] <MrDigital_> *put
[17:40:23] <robertWorkBeer> in your script.
[17:40:36] <robertWorkBeer> that'll obviously work in your console.
[17:40:45] <robertWorkBeer> it sounds like it's not actually running in the first place.
[17:41:00] <MrDigital_> console.log$( "span[id|='as-container']" ).css( "display", "");});    ?
[17:41:02] <MrDigital_> that right?
[17:41:04] <robertWorkBeer> no.
[17:41:11] <robertWorkBeer> just the bit i said.
[17:41:14] <MrDigital_> sorry i am fairly new
[17:41:15] <MrDigital_> to this
[17:41:19] <robertWorkBeer> you want to know if your code is even running.
[17:41:29] <robertWorkBeer> and if it is, are you even getting the element in question.
[17:41:39] <robertWorkBeer>  console.log($( "span[id|='as-container']"));
[17:41:45] <robertWorkBeer> right before your old code.
[17:42:03] <robertWorkBeer> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wh8t8x8g/1/
[17:42:06] <robertWorkBeer> like this.
[17:43:36] <MrDigital_> its in the log
[17:43:43] <MrDigital_> where can i paste it?
[17:43:49] <MrDigital_> in the JSF?
[17:44:13] <robertWorkBeer> a screenshot is fine i guess.
[17:45:11] <MrDigital_> http://puu.sh/bPgy7/55a8369461.png
[17:45:41] <robertWorkBeer> then something else is overriding your styling. hrm...
[17:46:08] <robertWorkBeer> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wh8t8x8g/2/ try this instead - do you see any changes?
[17:46:11] <MrDigital_> i think the code is loading before the javascript writes that line
[17:47:10] <MrDigital_> nope
[17:47:23] <robertWorkBeer> yeah then you have something else going on.
[17:48:00] <MrDigital_> could it be
[17:48:09] <robertWorkBeer> fixingthesejquery.com
[17:48:13] <robertWorkBeer> start reading i guess.
[17:48:17] <MrDigital_> the script loads before the other js runs
[17:48:26] <robertWorkBeer> shouldn't matter when stuff loads.
[17:48:30] <robertWorkBeer> it matters when the code itself runs.
[17:48:36] <robertWorkBeer> that's why we have document readies and window loads.
[17:49:35] <MrDigital_> hmmm
[18:17:13] <s5fs> robertWorkBeer: hey how goes
[18:17:17] <robertWorkBeer> hey man
[18:17:23] <s5fs> been quiet today?
[18:17:26] <robertWorkBeer> a little yeah.
[18:17:34] <robertWorkBeer> it slowed down pretty well.
[18:17:47] <Rashu> How can I bind a click function on an element that has display: none?
[18:17:58] <s5fs> good deal. we've been getting ddos'd a little bit, glad its not upsetting anyone
[18:18:13] <s5fs> seems to get blocked quickly but hey, always good to ask :)
[18:18:15] <robertWorkBeer> Rashu it... shouldn't matter?
[18:18:22] <robertWorkBeer> s5fs woah.
[18:18:24] <robertWorkBeer> that's pretty intense
[18:18:37] <s5fs> just another day on the internet, honestly. place is pretty aggressive.
[18:18:51] <robertWorkBeer> hahaha you're telling me.
[18:19:01] <Rashu> hmm robertWorkBeer would it matter if the element is being created on the fly?
[18:19:02] <robertWorkBeer> i sit in a room that gets customer feedbacks pumped in automatically.
[18:19:09] <robertWorkBeer> Rashu yep.
[18:19:14] <robertWorkBeer> use event delegation instead.
[18:19:19] <Rashu> So then that's my problem hrm
[18:19:26] <Rashu> event delegation?
[18:19:27] <robertWorkBeer> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[18:19:49] <Rashu> hm
[18:19:51] <robertWorkBeer> s5fs yeah you guys have do doing swimmingly.
[18:20:09] <s5fs> robertWorkBeer: many thanks, we're here to serve :D
[18:21:33] <robertWorkBeer> Rashu http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:21:45] <robertWorkBeer> woops i mean http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:21:51] <robertWorkBeer> and with that, i go home.
[18:21:55] <robertWorkBeer> enjoy folks.
[18:22:06] <Rashu> robertWorkBeer I think I understand for the easy functions I have, click and keyup but what about validate?
[18:22:09] <Rashu> noooooo
[18:22:11] <Rashu> :(
[18:24:49] <Velveeta> validate would work the same way
[18:32:41] <Rashu> Velveeta I'm just not getting it. Is it acceptable to post a url with specific line numbers where to find the code in question?
[18:33:08] <Velveeta> you can post it to something like jsfiddle.net
[18:33:34] <Velveeta> i'm gonna have to take off in the next couple minutes though, so you gotta be quick
[18:34:21] <Rashu> I can't get it to jsfiddle.net quickly unfortunately :/ theres a lot of code that I'd need to make sure works
[18:34:35] <Velveeta> well, i don't need to see the entire thing in action
[18:34:42] <Velveeta> if you have a snippet of code you're in question about, just paste that
[18:35:29] <Rashu> okay
[18:35:31] <Rashu> http://jsfiddle.net/ym5nb2dz/
[18:36:22] <Rashu> For some reason, (and I have a feeling it's because the elements aren't created by the time these functions get binded ?), none of the code gets fired and I can't seem to even trace it in the developer tools
[18:36:46] <Velveeta> yeah, that's entirely possible... did you read robert's link about event delegation?
[18:37:17] <Rashu> I did
[18:37:44] <Velveeta> so if those elements aren't created at the time, you'll want to use event delegation vs directly binding the event listeners like you're doing
[18:37:50] <Rashu> I wasn't entirely sure if the bolded sentence meant that even if I had a .on function call the element would have to be there
[18:38:03] <Rashu> oh oh oh is .on directly binding?
[18:38:22] <Velveeta> .on is a multipurpose function
[18:38:39] <Velveeta> you can use it for directly binding an event, or binding a delegated event listener
[18:39:13] <Velveeta> in both cases, you call some element to bind a listener on, $(element).on(eventName, optionalTarget, callback)
[18:39:34] <Rashu> oh oh oh i now understand what i think i need to do
[18:39:35] <Velveeta> so e.g. this is a direct binding: $('#form_submit').on('click', function () {})
[18:39:42] <Rashu> i'm calling it on the nonexistant "child"
[18:39:46] <Rashu> wher I need to call it on the parent
[18:39:53] <Rashu> with that optionalTarget being the child node
[18:39:55] <Velveeta> and this is a delegated listener: $(document).on('click', '#form_submit', function () {})
[18:40:00] <Velveeta> right
[18:40:16] <Velveeta> you want to call it on an element that you know does exist, so it could be any parent element all the way up to the document level
[18:40:46] <Rashu> if I know there will only be one instance of the element in question, does it matter if I go straight to the document level?
[18:40:57] <Rashu> or should I try to get it as close as possible to the child
[18:41:04] <Rashu> if my question makes any sense
[18:41:12] <Velveeta> well, both of those are correct things to ask
[18:41:28] <Rashu> :D im glad im making sense
[18:41:42] <Rashu> its starting to click for me so thank you
[18:42:13] <Velveeta> so, it doesn't matter if you go directly to the document, however, in best practice, you do want to bind it to the closest parent object that exists permanently
[18:42:17] <Velveeta> no problemo
[18:42:34] <Velveeta> so if you had say, a container with like an rss feed in it, which was populated via ajax calls or something
[18:42:52] <Velveeta> each div.article in that container might be a separate rss article being injected into that from the ajax call
[18:43:20] <Velveeta> you could either bind a click event as $(document).on('click', 'div.article', handler) or as $('#rssContainer').on('click', 'div.article', handler)
[18:43:47] <Velveeta> best practice dictates that you should scope that event listener to the closest applicable parent element
[18:44:13] <Velveeta> however, if you have those kinds of things popping up in multiple locations in your document, binding the listener to the document is perfectly fine too
[18:44:24] <Velveeta> so if you had like multiple rss containers in the document, for example
[18:44:49] <Rashu> bathroom. reading now
[18:44:54] <Velveeta> now also, you asked earlier "what about validate" when you 2 were on the topic of click and keyup handlers
[18:45:24] <Rashu> ah okay
[18:45:31] <Rashu> that makes sense
[18:45:33] <Velveeta> and in the example code you pasted, validate is a function vs an event, unless that function actually masks a validate event, in the way you can do $(element).click(handler) *or* $(element).on('click', handler)
[18:45:58] <Rashu> right
[18:46:05] <Velveeta> so if .validate() is just masking a call to add an event listener, then the validate event should work the exact same as click, you should be able to bind it directly or as a delegate
[18:46:25] <Velveeta> if it's a straight up function call to, say, validate a form, then you can't use delegation with it, you have to use it on a node that actually exists
[18:46:29] <Rashu> hmmm you lost me. let me read that agin
[18:46:31] <Rashu> again*
[18:46:58] <Velveeta> so you have this in that code snippet: this.validate({ submitHandler:contact_submit })
[18:47:12] <Rashu> right
[18:47:14] <Rashu> right right
[18:47:27] <Velveeta> which looks like a regular function call, so you couldn't set up something like $(document).on('validate', '#contact_form', handler)
[18:47:35] <Velveeta> because that's an actual function call and not an event
[18:47:51] <Rashu> before I had this: $("#contact_form").validate({ onkeyup:false, submitHandler:contact_submit });
[18:48:06] <Rashu> which looks like an event, no?
[18:48:08] <Rashu> wait
[18:48:24] <Rashu> no thats a function with options
[18:48:25] <Velveeta> nope, because an event binding takes a functional callback as its parameter, you're passing an object
[18:48:28] <Velveeta> right
[18:48:35] <Rashu> right
[18:49:02] <Rashu> so is my implementation wrong?
[18:49:25] <Velveeta> you could transform that line to use an event delegate for keyup though, like this: $(document).on('keyup', '#contact_form', function() { this.validate({ submitHandler:contact_submit })});
[18:50:27] <Velveeta> i don't know if the implementation is wrong or not, since i don't know what this chunk of code does in the overall grand scheme, but i can tell you how to modify it to use event delegates if your elements aren't available at the time that's trying to bind up its listeners
[18:50:33] <Velveeta> and hopefully that'll fix that problem
[18:52:59] <Rashu> hmm
[18:57:38] <deweydb> i have this super strange issue with jquery, where im setting position:fixed with the .css() command and it doesn't happen right away.
[18:57:56] <deweydb> video of what im talking about: http://ei.waspdigital.com/public_html/wtf.jquery.mov
[18:58:18] <deweydb> key code from the window on the right is:
[18:58:25] <deweydb> $('#search-form').css({'position':'fixed', 'top':0})
[18:58:25] <deweydb> console.log($('#search-form').css('position'))
[18:58:36] <deweydb> i set position fixed, and log the value immediately afterwards
[18:59:01] <deweydb> i can see it show "fixed" in the console. while the element is still "relative"
[19:00:37] <Velveeta> that link doesn't work
[19:00:49] <deweydb> http://ei.waspdigital.com/wtf.jquery.mov
[19:02:55] <Velveeta> so, i see what's going on in the video, but i can't see any of the code that's doing any of that work
[19:03:26] <Velveeta> but what i can recommend you do is to set a breakpoint on that node whenever its attributes are modified
[19:03:40] <Velveeta> and then when it switches back to relative, see what code is causing that change
[19:05:38] <Velveeta> ok, gotta go for a bit
[19:06:58] <litropy> This works for everything except Safari for iOS. Why? http://jsfiddle.net/0n3hk7jc/2/
[19:08:33] <litropy> All I know is #info height is 0 after the function. It doesn't seem like it's populating.
[19:09:27] <deweydb> turns out it was a missing else.
[19:09:27] <litropy> Oh. Also,  articleinfo: $(this).children('infoarticle').text(); works fine. Note .text() instead of .html().
[19:09:29] <deweydb> thanks vispillo_
[19:09:33] <deweydb> er Velveeta
[23:10:04] <CorySimmons> how come this doesn't select anything? https://gist.github.com/corysimmons/6ba39e9f71ac1a21ed50#file-foo-js-L13
[23:11:00] <CorySimmons> but if i console.log settings.moveableSelector right above it, it logs .moveable
[23:58:36] <hotcockdotcom> anyone seen any soltuions or plugins for tiling desktop windows? i have a mdi html app, like 2 or 3 floating windows (divs) that i want the user to be able to move around (draggable) - just looking for something clean or simple; similar to jquery ui draggable
