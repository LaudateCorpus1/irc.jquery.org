[16:56:13] <kbni> Greetings!
[16:57:54] <kbni> Can someone tell me why $('#foo div.buttons button') returns nothing, but $('#foo div.buttons').find('button') does? This selector worked for a while..
[16:58:55] <kbni> I also had an issue where a $('.table_button').closest('tbody') stopped working, and I had to do $('.table_button').parent().parent().parent() to achieve the same thing
[17:04:17] <waveprop> total = $('.outer').width(); gives me 1200
[17:05:56] <waveprop> total_padding = ($('.outer').css('padding-left') + $('.outer').css('padding-right')); gives me 20px20px. how can i get the value from .css without the unit, so i can calculate the value
[17:15:57] <waveprop> let me rephrase that: is there a method to get a css property's numerical value without the unit?
[17:17:23] <waveprop> or must i manually reassign strip the unit and convert to integer type
[17:19:04] <waveprop> nm parseInte ftw
[18:47:12] <Neo1> waveprop: you aren't understood ...
[18:48:02] <Neo1> waveprop: you aren't understood its opposite you are understood ?
[21:01:56] <hendry> hi, I'm having trouble forming a selection for the values i want that aren't disabled https://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/pc8wndca/
[21:02:34] <waveprop> nah Neo1 i figured that one out.
[21:03:25] <waveprop> on another note, is there a was to use an existing css class, not in use within the current page, as a selector?
