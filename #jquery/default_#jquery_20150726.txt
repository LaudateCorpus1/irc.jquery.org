[00:06:49] <Pazician_> Hello, I'm trying to add a class to an element (only one tho) if image exists. This is how my code looks like right now, and it doesn't really work, either it applies to all the elements or none of them: http://paste.ofcode.org/krNhy2qLPQzirzkqUL7Cuh

[08:33:28] <ufk_> click/tap events are not firing on a canvas element with jquery mobile. any ideas?
[08:33:35] <k_j> hello
[08:33:45] <k_j> what does $() stand for?
[08:34:20] <ufk_> k_j: i know that $(func(){...}) will fire on document ready
[08:39:05] <k_j> ufk_, i am trying to run a program in nodejs, but it fails with   ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[08:39:28] <ufk_> nodejs server side with jquery?!
[08:39:45] <ufk_> or are
[08:40:00] <ufk_> or are you loading a view that supposed to serve html page with jquery code ?
[08:40:49] <docmur> This might not be the right room for this quesiton but how would I grab the current timestamp of and every single update a div, I tried this: https://jsfiddle.net/36hypkbj/1/ and it's not working
[08:40:52] <k_j> ufk_, i am trying to see what these functions produce (as strings)
[08:41:05] <k_j> ufk_, https://github.com/ESTOS/strophe.jingle/blob/master/strophe.jingle.sdp.js
[08:41:06] <thecoolguy> join #jquery
[08:41:21] <k_j> ufk_, but it looks like i cannot do that with nodejs, they require a browser
[08:42:32] <ufk_> k_j: yeah that's not a nodejs code
[08:42:47] <k_j> thanks
[08:45:58] <docmur> quit
[08:47:23] <k_j> ufk_, what do you suggest to make it a nodejs runnable script, i just need to get the output from those functions which process strings essentially
[08:47:38] <k_j> i don't know why they are so tied to jquery or client stuff
[08:49:54] <ufk_> k_j: use express-generator to create express based project. create a view that uses this code and outputs the required data.. maybe in json, then just call the url of the view to fetch the data
[08:50:26] <k_j> ok
[09:04:51] <k_j> what module can i try to have a dom parser in nodejs?
[09:23:20] <esaym153> where is some good examples of making a json powered input form?
[09:23:29] <esaym153> with jquery*
[09:45:50] <Abhijit> if i am calling function c recursively from function a. and while thats being processed if i called funciton c recursively from function b will this create conflcit?
[09:45:54] <Abhijit> conflict?
[09:55:39] <shoky> ...no
[10:00:15] <heller__> with .load() - for example this $("#myDiv").load('welcome.html');
[10:00:24] <heller__> how can i make it load #myDiv ?
[10:02:30] <Abhijit> ok.
[10:05:21] <wontoner> heller__: In your load call, put a space and then the div. 'welcome.html #myDiv'
[10:06:12] <wontoner> heller__: Your code will still be requesting the whole document, but jQuery will parse the document for the div you specify
[10:06:39] <heller__> it makes a div inside a div then
[10:06:51] <heller__> it was an example
[10:07:01] <heller__> this is what i'm really trying $("#bulb").load("/index.php #bulb"); }, 1000);
[10:08:25] <wontoner> If you are trying to manipulate the DOM to get contents already on the page, you don't need load. Load is specifcally for making a request to the webserver for another page's contents
[10:10:52] <heller__> well i want to refresh it
[10:11:14] <heller__> the div has an image, wichi is updated with other source
[10:11:34] <wontoner> Possibly you want a second script to provide the data.
[10:11:51] <heller__> umm
[10:13:19] <heller__> any other way then?
[10:13:51] <wontoner> The snippet of script you mentioned would make a request to index.php and then parse out only the contents of the #bulb target on that page.
[10:13:52] <BillCriswell> $('#bulb').load('/index.php #bulb', function () { console.log('done'); }); ?
[10:14:22] <heller__> wontoner: and update the original #bulb with it?
[10:15:25] <wontoner> Whichever page is making the call, it's #bulb will get it's HTML contents set to what load() returns.
[10:15:41] <shoky> heller__ what exactly is getting updated? where is it getting updated? by who?
[10:16:18] <wontoner> If your selector does not match, no request will be made.
[10:16:36] <heller__> wontoner: does it replace or add?
[10:16:37] <shoky> if it's an image file being updated on the server you can probably just change a caching dummy query param on the image .src
[10:16:56] <wontoner> I believe it will replace the contents of the element in your selector.
[10:17:10] <wontoner> If you had anything in there before the call to load()
[10:17:14] <heller__> div bulb is a php script which reads hardware status and makes the image accordingly
[10:17:45] <shoky> heller__ so its an <img src="somescript.php"> ?
[10:18:08] <heller__> shoky: the image is the output of php if-statement
[10:18:20] <heller__> its either bulb_off.png or bulb_on.png
[10:18:27] <shoky> oh.
[10:18:46] <heller__> and the same image works as a button
[10:18:57] <shoky> reloading the whole page just for that update seems like major overkill
[10:19:00] <heller__> which will change the state of a hardware device
[10:19:07] <heller__> shoky: it does
[10:19:17] <heller__> thats why, i would only like to update contents of #bulb
[10:19:33] <shoky> calling load() fetches the whole html
[10:19:46] <heller__> but only updates part of it?
[10:20:00] <shoky> and then that html gets parsed and the element you specific is extracted
[10:20:04] <heller__> or how can i only fetch the right div?
[10:20:11] <shoky> all this for changing some _on to _off
[10:20:39] <shoky> have a php that just outputs on or off or something
[10:20:58] <heller__> well it is doing the outputting
[10:20:59] <shoky> and read it from the js whenever you want to
[10:21:10] <heller__> but i need this refreshing to happen even if no one touches the screen
[10:21:41] <shoky> you can still use setTimeout or setInterval or whatever you want to schedule it for later
[10:22:43] <heller__> i still dont how to only update the div bulb
[10:23:10] <shoky> $('#bulp').attr('src', newsource)
[10:23:13] <shoky> bulb
[10:23:31] <shoky> assuming the <img> is the one with id #bulp
[10:23:34] <shoky> er.
[10:23:51] <shoky> bulb is such an unnatural word :\
[10:24:11] <heller__> http://pastebin.com/NHxGBDe7 helps?
[10:24:44] <shoky> $('#idOfYourImage').attr('src', theNewSource)
[10:24:47] <shoky> helps?
[10:25:30] <heller__> but even if #id-of-my-image is the same, the source wont always be the same
[10:26:01] <shoky> then don't pass the same source each time
[11:17:04] <Kartagis> are lines 4-6 legal?: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1u7nLu6h/8/
[11:17:15] <Kartagis> javascript pane
[11:19:02] <rcyr> Yes, why?
[11:19:13] <rcyr> It's just an object literal
[11:19:35] <Kartagis> rcyr: I mean will it work as is?
[11:19:57] <rcyr> Kartagis: It's syntactically valid, if it works or not also depends on the API
[11:20:14] <Kartagis> API of what?
[11:20:49] <rcyr> That rejicast thingy?
[11:21:23] <Kartagis> let me give you an example of that search

[11:22:16] <Kartagis> rcyr: ^
[11:22:47] <Kartagis> do I need to pass field_yasadigi_sehir_value?
[11:23:19] <rcyr> How do I know? Look at that website's documentation :/ I mean, I can't even read that.
[11:23:39] <rcyr> Kartagis: Your query works... as for the parameters, I don't know.
[11:37:06] <Kartagis> how can I log the query sent?
[11:37:39] <rcyr> Kartagis: Just look at it in your dev tool's network tab
[11:37:57] <rcyr> Kartagis: You'll be able to see what parameters were sent, what was the response.. etc
[11:38:32] <Kartagis> weird, I don't see anything
[11:39:32] <rcyr> Be sure your dev tools's network tab is opened before the call occurs
[11:39:42] <rcyr> Else you won't see it.
[11:40:12] <Kartagis> nothing
[11:41:40] <Kartagis> oh, I see it
[11:42:29] <Kartagis> it requests everything, even before I click the button
[11:45:13] <Kartagis> nailed it!
[11:46:00] <Kartagis> but how do I prevent it from requesting before my onclick?
[11:46:27] <rcyr> Kartagis: Can't see any click handler in the code you gave me
[11:46:36] <beasty> https://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[11:46:51] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1u7nLu6h/9/
[11:46:57] <Kartagis> rcyr: ^
[11:47:11] <rcyr> Kartagis: The second parameter of .on is a function, not what the function returns
[11:47:22] <rcyr> So $("#btn").on('click', getList, false); and not $("#btn").on('click', getList(), false);
[11:47:45] <Kartagis> oh
[11:48:00] <rcyr> $("#btn").on('click', getList(), false); is like doing var result = getList(); $("#btn").on('click', result, false); ... which doesn't make sense.
[11:48:43] <Kartagis> noted
[11:49:31] <shoky> um, that  , false  there doesn't belong there
[11:50:36] <tehopeologist> hi all
[11:50:41] <Kartagis> why is this http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1u7nLu6h/10/ taking /forever/?
[11:50:53] <tehopeologist> trying to figure out why both subnav items are triggered in this click conditional:
[11:50:54] <tehopeologist> https://gist.github.com/tehOPEologist/ddfbdbb9bc54f412a941
[11:50:56] <shoky> Kartagis:  drop the  , false
[11:52:38] <shoky> tehopeologist: because events bubble up to parents up the DOM tree
[11:52:46] <Kartagis> hrm
[11:53:11] <tehopeologist> shoky: what do you recommend i do so that only the one i click has the class added / removed?
[11:53:32] <shoky> tehopeologist  you can try e.stopPropagation()
[11:53:48] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1u7nLu6h/11/ this is not doing its thing the second time? isn't is supposed to?
[11:53:54] <tehopeologist> inside the click handler after i preventDefault?
[11:54:11] <shoky> tehopeologist yes. btw there's a .toggleClass
[11:54:51] <tehopeologist> mkay, i'll switch that over :)  thanks man, it worked!
[11:54:52] <tehopeologist> <3
[11:55:29] <shoky> Kartagis: it is doing its thing
[11:55:42] <Kartagis> not the second time
[11:55:44] <shoky> Kartagis: you're just not clearing the previously added elements
[11:55:55] <shoky> you're just appending
[11:56:13] <Kartagis> hrm, how do I do that?
[11:56:19] <Kartagis> .remove()?
[11:57:00] <shoky> .remove() removes a whole element. .empty() empties an element's inner contents
[11:57:16] <shoky> but i doubt you want to empty the <body>
[11:57:30] <shoky> or remove it :P
[11:58:09] <Kartagis> body empty removes the select as well
[11:58:23] <shoky> you're a smart guy.
[11:58:37] <shoky> am sure you will figure it out
[11:58:43] <Kartagis> I want to remove .container
[11:59:51] <shoky> spend some time away from irc. try to solve it on your own
[12:00:23] <Kartagis> but I must first check if body has any elements with the container class
[12:00:36] <shoky> tip: don't append everything to <body>
[12:00:53] <shoky> have an inner element that you append to, and you can just empty this element
[12:01:03] <shoky> withotu caring about the rest of the stuff in <body>
[12:02:52] <Kartagis> then remove that element
[12:03:06] <Kartagis> empty*
[12:03:14] <Kartagis> okay
[12:18:32] <jak2000> hi all
[12:19:56] <Ice_Strike> I have seen a website that recieve meta via ajax without doing repeative check every 5 seconds or so. A browser recieve meta data instantly and it is not using websocket.
[12:19:59] <Ice_Strike> How is that possible?
[12:21:27] <jak2000> hi all, i use .ajax funciton send 2 paramters to a jsp webpage, and the jsp return a JSPN object how to receive and know the values? thanks
[12:21:57] <shoky> Ice_Strike: can be done via long polling, server keeps the http connection open
[12:22:55] <Ice_Strike> Ah I see. Thats good.
[12:23:56] <Ice_Strike> Any con with long polling?
[12:33:44] <shoky> Ice_Strike with some server technologies it can hog resources if a thread/process is up just for this request. but not really a problem with more modern tech e.g. nginx
[12:34:02] <shoky> Ice_Strike and also there's a limit on number of concurrent connections
[12:36:11] <Ice_Strike> shoky Ah I see. Let assume 1000 open browsers (Clients) that doing long polling
[12:36:34] <Ice_Strike> Shouldnt be a problem with nginx if setup right?
[12:37:00] <shoky> Ice_Strike if the server is ok with it then it's fine
[12:38:18] <Ice_Strike> yep
[12:44:17] <arc_> ok, i've banged my head against this for long enough. i completely don't understand why this isn't working
[12:45:28] <arc_> i know this isn't a simplified test case but everything works fine in the test case and i can't figure out what the difference is
[12:45:50] <arc_> working site here http://porath.org/w/fab5/ test case here http://jsfiddle.net/c891m2a6/1/
[12:46:23] <arc_> it's like the script doesn't see the object i'm trying to work on at all
[12:46:48] <arc_> i'm trying to change the number of "items" that are showed at once, but it doesn't do anything
[12:47:06] <arc_> works fine in jsfiddle but not on my site
[12:49:46] <arc_> also, autoplay and stoponhover don't do anything anywhere, but that's secondary
[12:52:04] <shoky> arc_: you have some other place in theme.js that's also initializing that carousel before
[12:52:35] <arc_> hmm, okay, i'll check that out, thanks
[12:53:00] <arc_> how did you find that, btw?
[12:54:00] <shoky> arc_: searched your files for ".owlCarousel"
[12:54:14] <shoky> used ctrl-shift-f in chrome devtools
[12:54:38] <arc_> k thanks
[12:55:03] <shoky> arc_: seems like it's because you have the owl-carousel class on that element on load
[12:55:36] <arc_> i think that's required for the plugin to work at all
[12:55:44] <arc_> i just commented out the other initialization
[12:55:46] <shoky> it's not
[12:55:58] <shoky> not for the owl carousel anyway, maybe for whatever plugin framework yuo have there
[12:56:36] <arc_> okay, idk. all the examples on their site showed it having that class, so i just used it
[12:56:50] <arc_> but it works now anyway
[12:57:30] <shoky> arc_ ok but you have some code there that's auto-initializing all elements with that class, for some reason
[12:58:37] <arc_> this page is based on an html theme so there is some amount of cruft i haven't removed
[12:59:36] <shoky> oks. seems like whoever wrote this theme.js wanted you to do something like  <div class="owl-carousel" data-plugin-options="...">
[12:59:52] <shoky> and have that auto initialize without you calling any js code
[12:59:56] <arc_> yes, that's what it was before
[13:00:09] <shoky> kk
[13:00:22] <arc_> i didn't want to do it that way, because the syntax is confusing and none of the examples are written that way
[13:11:23] <decx> well don't use the same class if the init on that is still called
[13:13:32] <thecoolguy> is it possible to put gaps in opacity
[13:18:16] <decx> what, like interlacing?
[15:00:32] <kegster> is there a proper method to, upon a specific link (#foo) with target="_blank" being clicked, to have the page where the link is to refresh AFTER the new window has popped up?
[15:37:28] <thecoolguy> hello
[15:50:20] <PiL> hello all, why am i getting autocomplete not found?
[15:50:54] <PiL> ive loaded the jquery library once, ive put it into document ready, ive loaded ui
[15:50:57] <nodist> PiL do you have a paste?
[15:51:29] <nodist> brb
[15:51:37] <PiL> nodist: i can post the site
[15:51:49] <nodist> k I check it in a few min
[15:55:00] <PiL> nodist: http://travel-colonel.c9.io/
[15:55:53] <PiL> it seems to work outside of my tree
[15:58:07] <PiL> brb
[15:58:33] <shoky> PiL: you're including jquery again after including jquery-ui.  here:  <script src="joomla_54741_data/jquery_003.js" ..
[16:01:04] <shoky> PiL: also that "async" on the jquery-ui include could be problematic if you try to run jquery-ui code before jquery-ui is included
[16:03:59] <PiL> shoky: that makes sense, however the problem is still there
[16:04:59] <shoky> PiL: see the first thing i said..
[16:05:22] <PiL> sorry mate its off my screen
[16:05:50] <nodist> back
[16:05:54] <PiL> hah
[16:05:55] <shoky>  <shoky> PiL: you're including jquery again after including jquery-ui.  here:  <script src="joomla_54741_data/jquery_003.js" ..
[16:06:23] <PiL> i think thats not the library, let me double check
[16:06:49] <shoky> /*! jQuery v1.11.2  ...   sure looks like jquery :P
[16:07:03] <PiL> haha
[16:07:18] <nodist> is this code for a job challenge?
[16:07:26] <PiL> yes lol
[16:07:34] <nodist> you need to clean it up
[16:07:45] <PiL> any suggestions?
[16:07:55] <PiL> right clean it up
[16:08:11] <nodist> when I did mine I did not use any minimization on page, just for the libs so it was easier to see
[16:08:38] <nodist> you would state then when you send it in for production you would minimize it
[16:08:45] <PiL> im just triying to get the bid
[16:09:04] <shoky> how did you know it's a job challenge?
[16:09:15] <nodist> it looks similar to one I did
[16:09:21] <shoky> o
[16:09:22] <nodist> and who makes a travel site?
[16:09:36] <nodist> jk
[16:09:38] <PiL> hah, i dont know
[16:09:40] <shoky> ;p
[16:09:54] <PiL> its a big price, pay the rent for a few months
[16:09:58] <PiL> its due on tuesday!
[16:10:48] <nodist> oh its an actual job, I thought it was a question from a recruiter
[16:11:48] <PiL> oh man, i have 0 luck with recruiters. check out freelancer.com
[16:13:51] <PiL> all you do is find a joomla template, then add jquery hooks, oh and dont forget easy peasy php
[16:16:53] <nodist> working on it now
[16:18:03] <shoky> you have luck with freelancer.com ?
[16:18:09] <nodist> Pil your fix -> https://jsfiddle.net/6hkatwv9/2/
[16:19:07] <shoky> lol,  (function($) { ... })($);   does absolutely nothing
[16:19:09] <PiL> oh i got it thanks
[16:19:43] <shoky> well, it does something, but shouldn't be used for what it does
[16:20:17] <nodist> lol it works without it, I need to re learn scopes
[16:20:30] <PiL> shoky: which file is it?
[16:22:03] <shoky> PiL: that's from nodist's fiddle. in your code that i saw before  it had  $(function() { ... })  instead  but that wasn't needed either because its just an alias to $(document).ready  and it was already being called inside a $(document).ready block
[16:23:05] <nodist> the index.html one
[16:23:33] <PiL> oh, i would rather keep the document ready at the top
[16:23:53] <shoky> it was already there. you just had an extra redundant one inside around the autocomplete call
[16:24:12] <shoky> anyways the problem again was that you were including jquery twice
[16:24:34] <PiL> what the heck, i dont see any nested document readys
[16:25:02] <nodist> http://modernweb.com/2013/05/06/5-things-you-should-stop-doing-with-jquery/
[16:25:08] <shoky> PiL:  you have $(document).ready( function() {    and inside it you have:  $(function() {  ... })
[16:25:15] <shoky> that's a nested document ready
[16:25:36] <PiL> oh haha
[16:26:31] <PiL> so where is a good place to start with jquery, any books to suggest?
[16:26:54] <shoky> http://learn.jquery.com/   is good to start with
[16:27:14] <GreatDanton> try codecademy
[16:32:35] <PiL> your stuff does not work
[16:33:01] <PiL> im apologise i am grateful
[16:33:03] <nodist> the fiddle?
[16:33:12] <PiL> nah, the autocomplete
[16:33:22] <shoky> you removed both document.ready's  :P
[16:33:42] <nodist> ah, you need to put them at the bottom of the page for it to work as in the fiddle
[16:33:51] <shoky> or in a document.ready
[16:33:59] <nodist> if your leaving them at top yeah^
[16:35:18] <PiL> cool, also, what is the significance of the "$" sign in javascript, i know its a selector, is that syntatic sugar?
[16:35:32] <rcyr> PiL: It's like any letter
[16:36:00] <PiL> oh heh
[16:36:10] <shoky> and jquery uses it as an alias for jQuery
[16:37:14] <PiL> oh ok, also, i put the fiddle in a document ready and im getting errors ugh
[16:37:52] <shoky> PiL you have a syntax error, you didnt do the document ready correctly
[16:38:10] <shoky> it's   $(document).ready(function() {  ...  })
[16:38:11] <PiL> lol, im so embarassed
[16:38:55] <shoky> you're doing fine ;p
[16:39:34] <shoky> PiL: and again, you are still including jquery twice
[16:40:46] <shoky> PiL: and you can remove  both of those nested  (function ($) { ... })($)
[16:46:39] <PiL> lol, im just gonna move it down with the rest
[16:47:47] <PiL> how do you tell if jquery is loaded twice?
[16:48:40] <rcyr> network tab probably
[16:48:40] <PiL> just manually examining?
[16:49:05] <shoky> pretty much, don't know of a quick way
[16:49:59] <shoky> PiL: but this is the second include:   <script src="joomla_54741_data/jquery_003.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[16:50:35] <shoky> heh now you removed both?
[16:50:52] <shoky> there you go
[16:51:02] <PiL> yes, i thought i alreayd did that
[17:16:41] <PiL> thanks guys, now i have international cities loading in my travel app
[17:16:54] <PiL> now for date picker : )
[18:29:41] <thecoolguy> What do i have to put on live 6 of the javascript to stop resizing ? http://jsfiddle.net/dragonpiper/4Vfm5/1590/
[18:42:49] <SimbaLion`> Hi, I've been working on http://jsfiddle.net/xvchqphd/ it works great, but I'd like to change the report function so it visually seperates the manually inputted items from the 'Add-Ons:', then the text can be quickly cut and pasted without edits to an e-mail. Is this possible?
[18:48:20] <SimbaLion`> I am guessing I'd need to re-write the way the button works, but I thought I'd ask experts first
[18:56:48] <ferrumman> hello all
[18:58:39] <ferrumman> can someone help me with a file?
[19:00:23] <ferrumman> anyone in here?
[19:07:51] <shoky> just ask
[19:08:02] <ferrumman> thanks shoky
[19:08:54] <ferrumman> i have this file: http://pastebin.com/Jvpfa0Y2 - and on line 83 there is a GET function, I need to add a POST function and define the variables i need to POST, not sure how to go about this
[19:10:49] <shoky> what's the problem?  you can't POST with jsonp btw
[19:11:42] <ferrumman> The problem is I dont know how to add a command/function so I can POST to a URL
[19:12:04] <ferrumman> I’ve read: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/  - but still don’t understand how to implement it
[19:12:50] <shoky> $.post('url', {param1: value1, param2: value2})
[19:16:13] <ferrumman> I just add that anywhere?
[19:16:28] <shoky> wherever you want it to execute
[19:16:54] <shoky> like any other javascript statement you'd write :P
[19:19:23] <ferrumman> if i want to it POST after the submit button has been clicked then i put it on line 164?
[19:20:23] <shoky> i guess?
[19:20:41] <shoky> line 134 would work too..
[19:31:47] <ferrumman> and i use the same parameters that are defined in lines 138-155 right?
[19:33:27] <shoky> ferrumman: how should i know? it depends what parameters you want to send
[19:34:09] <ferrumman> gotcha, im just not sure how the function knows where to seek those paramters
[19:34:22] <ferrumman> im obviously very new to thi
[19:34:23] <ferrumman> this
[19:34:29] <shoky> you pass it the parameters
[19:35:04] <shoky> if you want to send a param called "name" with value of "bob", you do  $.post('url', {name: "bob"})
[19:35:19] <shoky> it knows the parameters because you passed them in as an argument
[19:36:20] <ferrumman> $.post('url', {FirstName: first_name})
[19:36:40] <ferrumman> so using that, I will POST FirstName and it will send whatever first_name is equal to?
[19:37:02] <shoky> yep
[19:37:23] <ferrumman> awesome ty, let me try it our
[19:37:24] <ferrumman> out*
[20:16:01] <ferrumman> shoky still here?
[20:16:36] <shoky> ferrumman yes but going to bed in a couple minutes
[20:18:15] <ferrumman> if i use $.post(‘http://abc.com’, {FirstName: first_name&LastName:last_name&City:city_})     would that send a url that looks like http://abc.com&FirstName=Tom&LastName=Jacobs
[20:18:38] <Woet> ferrumman: no.
[20:18:56] <nodist> for that url you need a GET
[20:19:18] <ferrumman> I’m not going to have hair left in about an hour
[20:20:36] <shoky> ferrumman POST data is sent in the request body, not in the url.  also btw you have & instead of ,
[20:21:10] <ferrumman> ty shoky
[20:21:32] <ferrumman> can i just dump what i am working on here?
[20:21:48] <shoky> use a pastebin or jsfiddle
[20:21:54] <ferrumman> trying to get this http://developers.hasoffers.com/affiliate_signup/
[20:21:59] <shoky> try to put only the relevant parts ;p
[20:22:32] <ferrumman> so when data is submitted, it adds a contact following this: http://support.ontraport.com/entries/26073705-Contacts-API#add
[20:29:28] <shoky> ok?
[20:36:02] <ferrumman> i cant figure it out
[20:37:38] <shoky> what have you tried?  are you sure their API supports cross-domain requests from a browser?
[20:49:30] <ferrumman> i have no idea
[20:56:00] <shoky> you should find out ;p it needs to specifically support it
[20:56:08] <shoky> i'm off, good luck
[20:58:14] <ycon_> Hi, I'm getting some jquery that's conflicting on my site (www.stashdapp.com/prize). Not sure where to start repairing the error. Ideas?
[22:05:27] <kokut> Hello, for some reason my slideToggle call that was working fine now its not showing the animation anymore
