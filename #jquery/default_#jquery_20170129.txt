[00:26:16] <mekhami> for some reason i've never made sense of this. https://gist.github.com/mekhami/b16fb7f4564c00bebabdc79094d93752 i've got a google maps thing, it renders the map, but my jquery .get function doesn't seem to do anything. It doesn't do either of the console.log statements, even though i can see the API request and the 200 status code
[01:39:58] <jak2000> any plugin for display data extracted from a database, and can do a pagination and edit data, and save dat to database? exist?
[04:02:39] <metrixx> hi.
[04:03:32] <metrixx> on keyup event i am searching the specified string in an array of elements' text values
[04:03:52] <metrixx> i limited minimum character to 3 to search
[04:04:21] <metrixx> but when i type 3. character on textbox, it freeze for a while and then search
[04:04:32] <metrixx> how can i fix this freeze problem?
[04:04:54] <metrixx> something like asyncronous but maybe a trick
[04:28:10] <[0xAA]> metrixx: that's expected
[04:28:18] <[0xAA]> it'll freeze until the thing is found
[04:28:23] <[0xAA]> even asynchrony can't fix this
[04:28:38] <metrixx> i found a delay trick to start search
[04:28:42] <[0xAA]> asynchrony can fix the I/O blocking and events, but cannot fix the actual processing
[04:28:43] <metrixx> it works better for now
[06:47:35] <printForever> Looking for some help with wildcards in jQuery/JavaScript
[06:48:14] <printForever> I would like to select each of the classes/id's block1 block2 block3 block4 block5... with block* is it possible?
[07:53:35] <kraucrow> $('element[id^=block]')
[07:55:59] <kraucrow> for classes it would be more complicated because class="foo bar block4"  or class="block3 foobar baz" possible.

[19:27:01] <jak2000> i want use the datetimepicker of jquery-ui.... but get a error(in console): "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).datepicker is not a function"   i declare these 3 lines:   <script src="js/libs/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>   <script src="js/libs/jquery-ui.js"></script>    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/jquery-ui.css">   of course the files are located OK, any advice why? the error?
[19:56:11] <clearin> https://ibb.co/kejATv can anyone help me with this. i dont know how to describe it. see the image. what should i put in "?" to get the value.
[20:17:55] <clearin> hello?
[20:18:36] <sillyslux> there's [a:function
[20:18:44] <sillyslux> what's that supposed to be?
[20:18:50] <sillyslux> does it throw?
[20:19:51] <sillyslux> if it wasn't for a anonymous function you'd use $(this)
[20:20:11] <sillyslux> but that code smells anyway
[20:20:40] <clearin> $(this) returns undefined
[20:22:03] <sillyslux> create a fiddle
[20:22:30] <clearin> ok
[20:22:32] <clearin> !paste

[20:38:46] <Frylock> random question about jquery, so I have a chrome/ff version of the same addon, with webextension for FF I recently ported chrome version to FF, chrome using jquery of course
[20:39:09] <Frylock> however the same jquery doesnt work in FF due to some cross origin shenanigans - swithced to to XMLHTTPRequest and it works like a treat
[20:40:09] <Frylock> pretty confused as to whats happening there and why FF would stop a cross origin post (as in, the ajax never executes, FF just aborts it)
[20:42:02] <sillyslux> jak2000, you're loading jquery then you add jquery-ui to that, then you this construct by loading another jquery
[20:42:14] <sillyslux> inside <form>
[20:42:53] <sillyslux> *then you DELETE this construct by loading another jquery
[20:43:42] <sillyslux> by the time you run $("#fechanacimiento").datepicker(); there's only the 2nd jquery available, without jquery-ui
[20:50:24] <jak2000> sillyslux: you mean:  <script src="template/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>   right?
[20:50:28] <jak2000> delete this line?
[20:51:25] <sillyslux> clearin, http://jsfiddle.net/Lr1y0L1n/2/
[20:51:41] <jak2000> done !
[20:51:59] <sillyslux> yes
[20:52:10] <clearin> sillyslux: the problem is this id of the table is dynamic.
[20:53:22] <sillyslux> clearin, the #example part?
[20:53:29] <clearin> sillyslux: yes.
[21:04:21] <sillyslux> ok, i don't see how it can be done easily, i think you should do some magic maybe with a closure? idk, maybe there's a way with a custom plugin? maybe even with one of the existing plugins? idk, sry
[21:04:58] <clearin> ok thanks for the time sillyslux
[21:05:05] <clearin> and help
[21:05:31] <sillyslux> depends all on how you plan to make $('#example').DataTable dynamic
[21:06:04] <sillyslux> build a closure around that and provide a handle there
[21:10:25] <clearin> i am using a plugin. i am avoiding to edit the source. the part that i can edit is in "ajax: url: ..., data: function (d) {  ...  }"
[21:12:04] <sillyslux> well... the dynamic part is #example in $('#example').DataTable({...})?
[21:12:26] <clearin> yes
[21:12:35] <sillyslux> then how is it dynamic?
[21:13:43] <sillyslux> can't you use a closure there?
[21:15:50] <sillyslux> if it's exampleVar='#example' and you do $(exampleVar).DataTable({...}) then you should still have access to exampleVar in that function down there
[21:16:06] <sillyslux> if you run into problems with that, use a closure
[21:16:57] <sillyslux> but sry idk this datatable plugin
[21:17:11] <sillyslux> so can't really tell you much
[21:21:34] <Vanny> Hi All, wierd question. I am trying something new, but if I have a object <div class="escape"> is is possible by jquery to add an </div> or 2 before it
[21:22:07] <sillyslux> object or string?
[21:22:35] <Vanny> object
[21:22:51] <sillyslux> where do you get this object from?
[21:22:58] <sillyslux> what kind of object is that??
[21:31:01] <Vanny> when I use $( ".escape" ).before("a</div>b"); it puts the ab before the <div class="escape"> but not the </div>?
[21:35:57] <sillyslux> why would you want to close the previous div tag and kind of break everything?
[21:36:32] <Vanny> its a cms thing, I need to escape some design issues are time, and the CMS wont let me, but I might be able to JQUERY around it
[21:39:03] <sillyslux> well then don't mess with valid html, there's plenty of options to manipulate the dom with jquery https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[21:42:24] <Vanny> wrap might work ill play with that.
[22:11:11] <jak2000> sillyslux: jquery-ui.theme.min
[22:11:13] <jak2000> is for?
[22:12:38] <sillyslux> what?
[22:12:54] <sillyslux> .css maybe?
[22:14:00] <jak2000> yes
[22:14:05] <jak2000> my datetimepicker
[22:14:08] <jak2000> not load the arrows
[22:14:12] <carpii> its a minified version, thats all
[22:14:36] <carpii> check chromes network tab to see which images are 404
[22:14:38] <sillyslux> and jquery-ui.theme.min.css then
[22:14:46] <carpii> probably its expecting an images subdirectory to be present
[22:15:05] <jak2000> https://postimg.org/image/fwz1o9tv5/
[22:16:06] <jak2000> done
[22:16:22] <sillyslux> you haven't updated http://aero.ddns.net:8080/jAero/servletIrCatAlumno
[22:16:40] <jak2000> but themes jquery-ui.structure.min.css and jquery-ui.theme.min.css  is for?
