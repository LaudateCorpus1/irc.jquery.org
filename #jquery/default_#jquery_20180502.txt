[10:00:54] <Storydude> anyone here mind helping me debug an ajax call?  i can get the call to go through, but the element it's supposed to create is nowhere to be found
[10:01:33] <Storydude> basically, it's supposed to generate a second dropdown based on the value of the first dropdown
[10:12:04] <Levin^> good morning
[10:17:25] <Cork> Storydude: create a jsfiddle showing the problem you have
[10:17:36] <Cork> if it is the element showing up it most likely isn't ajax related
[10:18:09] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/vjxWRN
[10:18:17] <Levin^> instructions inside!
[10:22:55] <Storydude> i've got a gist if that works instead
[10:23:17] <Storydude> https://gist.github.com/dyingontheinside/85419710e5ab6e761ded76a5503be1d5
[10:23:58] <AdamPDotty> Levin^: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JvNxPR
[10:24:03] * AdamPDotty feels instructed
[10:24:09] <Levin^> lol
[10:24:30] <Levin^> AdamPDotty: thanks :)
[10:24:49] <Uhkis> and next time do your homework yourself :D
[10:25:48] * AdamPDotty was just into it
[10:26:07] <Levin^> lol
[10:26:28] <Cork> Storydude: that code has php and javascript in the same file
[10:26:52] <Cork> Storydude: making me question if it actually runs in the correct order
[10:27:33] <Cork> and no gist isn't run-able code, so isn't enough
[10:27:47] <AdamPDotty> attributes with ', with " and even without quotes
[10:27:48] <Storydude> i think it does?  the way it currently runs; if, in the seecond file i uncomment the header call, it displays the header when the onclick is activated
[10:27:51] <AdamPDotty> all in al quite a mess
[10:27:54] <AdamPDotty> l
[10:29:11] <Cork> AdamPDotty: it is code meant to work with ie5, what do you expect...
[10:31:02] * AdamPDotty wonders whether he ever took out the feature for netscape navigator
[11:48:40] <linurandy> hello
[12:14:32] <linurandy> anyone that work with jquerui tabs
[15:58:10] <k0nichiwa> apply(this, arguments) .. i dont see where 'arguments' come from
[15:58:56] <k0nichiwa> example https://github.com/dosx/timezone-picker/blob/master/jquery.timezone-picker.js line 739
[16:01:38] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa are you asking about how apply works?
[16:02:18] <k0nichiwa> sorry i didn tknow arugments was a keyword
[16:02:21] <k0nichiwa> found it
[16:02:24] <robertmaxrees> ah :)
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something I'd avoid normally.
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> but it's a thing :)
[16:05:14] <k0nichiwa> line 637 methods.init never seems to return a value
[16:05:30] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you can link to line numbers.
[16:05:47] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/dosx/timezone-picker/blob/master/jquery.timezone-picker.js?utf8=%E2%9C%93#L637
[16:05:55] <robertmaxrees> just click the line # and copy the URL of the page.
[16:07:52] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa what are you trying to figure out?>
[16:08:16] <k0nichiwa> where can i find api docs on the jquery get method https://github.com/dosx/timezone-picker/blob/master/jquery.timezone-picker.js#L670
[16:08:37] <k0nichiwa> i need to write a simple google maps widget, thought of using this as  reference, patteern
[16:08:42] <k0nichiwa> so im trying to better understand it
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ is the entire API
[16:09:24] <k0nichiwa> when i look up jqyery get i keep finding pages about invoking ajax GET method
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[16:09:36] <robertmaxrees> this is what you're looking for.
[16:09:37] <k0nichiwa> thanks
[16:10:22] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make a jquery plugin for it?
[16:10:51] <k0nichiwa> no for my project i need to show location markers on google maps, data to come from database query
[16:11:02] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:11:13] <k0nichiwa> jquery plugin would be a format to make it usable by others yes ?
[16:11:29] <k0nichiwa> i dont need to make it a plugin
[16:11:32] <robertmaxrees> it's an option.
[16:11:48] <robertmaxrees> doesn't necessarily mean it's predicated on whether or not somebody else will use it.
[16:18:39] <Katronix> Hi all, can someone please look at my code at http://jsbin.com/cugegemada/edit?html,js,output and tell me why the $this comes back as being "Uncaught ReferenceError: $this is not defined" ?
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> because you don't define $this anywhere.
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> you want just this
[16:20:19] <Katronix> I thought including the jquery library defined $this, do I need a line that says $this = '#other' ?
[16:20:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't magically create vars within functions :)
[16:20:42] <robertmaxrees> var $this = $(this)
[16:20:45] <robertmaxrees> but in your case
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use this.checked, so you don't want to use $(this)
[16:21:40] <Katronix> Would '#other'.checked be better then? because while that didn't error, it didn't work as expected either
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:01] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[16:22:23] <Katronix> If the other radio button is checked, the text box below to be active and required
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> which happens if you use this.checked
[16:23:34] <Katronix> Let me see
[16:23:36] <robertmaxrees> but clicking off doesn't work because the change event doesn't fire on the other.
[16:24:35] <Katronix> yeah changing $this to this solved it 50% :)
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:24:50] <robertmaxrees> there's a slightly different approach to this.
[16:25:03] <Katronix> what would that way be?
[16:25:35] <Katronix> (and thanks for the help, often I get the cold shoulder 'RTFM' responses when trying to do stuff like this
[16:25:45] <robertmaxrees> listen to the change of all the inputs and then check the value of $('#other')
[16:27:44] <Katronix> If I gave the other 6 the id of 'great', could I just have one Listen for all of them? because if its any of the first 6, the text box shouldn't be enabled.
[16:27:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:27:58] <robertmaxrees> can't duplicate IDs.
[16:28:02] <robertmaxrees> and my way is simpler.
[16:28:04] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[16:28:06] <Katronix> ok
[16:29:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/gopijecilu/1/edit
[16:30:50] <k0nichiwa> that codes too complicated think ill start from a google maps api example
[16:31:24] <Katronix> actually it makes sense to me :)
[16:33:01] <Levin^> hello
[16:33:04] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qYmgbr
[16:33:08] <Levin^> instructions inside!
[16:33:23] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:33:28] <Levin^> :)
[16:33:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:23] <robertmaxrees> what happened to the filter you were suggested?
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> or the .has() you insisted on using?
[16:34:57] <Levin^> someone else said each() works fine lol
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> filter or has are smarter choiced.
[16:35:22] <robertmaxrees> *choices
[16:35:27] <Levin^> oh
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use each, but thinking through your problem, those are smarter choices.
[16:36:23] <Levin^> hm
[16:36:35] <robertmaxrees> also, your instructions are flawed.
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> "If .melon has no .seeds, it should delete that .melon"
[16:36:56] <Levin^> lol
[16:37:02] <Levin^> you're right
[16:37:06] <robertmaxrees> but then you say "In the example below Melon 2 shall be erased."
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> except it has .seeds
[16:37:24] <Levin^> I forgot to update that line accordingly lol
[16:37:36] <robertmaxrees> update then and share back out.
[16:38:11] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qYmgbr?editors=1010
[16:38:18] <robertmaxrees> and then ask your question in here :)
[16:38:36] <Levin^> instructions inside :<
[16:38:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:39:20] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/odwXqp
[16:39:34] <robertmaxrees> and $('.seeds *') is about as good as it'll get.
[16:39:48] <Levin^> lol
[16:39:50] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question what you're using to generate this markup.
[16:40:04] <robertmaxrees> why render empty elements like that in the first place?
[16:40:08] <Levin^> I thought using * was a dirty hack, accordingly to some devs
[16:40:18] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[16:40:35] <Levin^> I just oversimplified what I need it to do
[16:40:39] <robertmaxrees> but given your constraints...
[16:40:55] <robertmaxrees> just because it's a hack doesn't mean your JS is the issue.
[16:41:01] <robertmaxrees> in this case, your markup is flawed imo.
[17:07:30] <k0nichiwa> an jquery ui resizable be used with a div given fixed position at bottom right of viewport ?
[17:07:43] <k0nichiwa> i want user to be able to drag n, w, and nw poritons of div to resize
[17:08:03] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[17:08:45] <k0nichiwa> in tests when i try to make the element resizeable when user drags handle, div jumps to top of viewport
[17:09:07] <k0nichiwa> when user drags n, or to left when user drags w
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it.
[17:10:28] <k0nichiwa> oh wow theres a css property for that now
[17:11:44] <benyoo> what are roles in jquerymobile? Like <div role="main" for example?
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> you mean data-role ?
[17:12:42] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquerymobile.com/data-attribute/ benyoo
[17:13:22] <robertmaxrees> ah i see what you're referring to.
[17:13:25] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/20804306/923919
[17:13:31] <robertmaxrees> this should give some context.
[17:13:37] <benyoo> yeah, but thx
[17:14:08] <benyoo> but its something similar i think :D
[17:16:36] <benyoo> ok now I understand, thats like the <main> tag from html5
[17:17:37] <benyoo> role='main' is just another why or for jqm a better way to work with it, with diffrent browsers
[17:17:45] <benyoo> *way
[17:32:19] <k0nichiwa> maybe it should be fixed to the top left ...
[17:32:31] <k0nichiwa> trying to gert resizable to work with bottom right looks to be hard

[18:34:20] <bRinbg> Hello, i have a Question about Mobile Image Upload and Form type="file". If i upload a Image with my Mobilephone over Photo Libary, that works. But if i taken a new Photo and try to Upload it, that fails, anyone idea what i do wrong?
[18:35:20] <robertmaxrees> bRinbg this related to jquery?
[18:35:22] <robertmaxrees> or just in general?
[18:36:12] <bRinbg> I use jquery with ajax for Upload. But i dont no, i think thats a HTML problem because the form is empty. But i dont no :-)
[18:37:24] <robertmaxrees> any idea where the failure occurs?
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> server-side or client-side?
[18:39:54] <bRinbg> I use laravel/jquery/ajax - i give over alert for debugging back what the form pass to laravel. If i use the Photo Libary he passing over the form, the tempname etc. - But if i taken a new Photo, he passing nothing.
[18:41:57] <robertmaxrees> is this client side or server side?
[18:42:10] <robertmaxrees> (it's almost impossible to help since you're not really giving me meaningful information ;) )
[18:42:47] <bRinbg> yea, i know that i dont give you enough info, but the problem is i have not enough info, because chrome app has not debugging tool :-D
[18:43:00] <bRinbg> And its ajax, laravel etc.. :S complicated.
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> wait
[18:43:32] <robertmaxrees> "chrome app has not a debugging tool"???
[18:43:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean mobile chrome?
[18:43:54] <bRinbg> Yes
[18:44:03] <bRinbg> Iphone Chrome App :-d
[18:44:05] <robertmaxrees> it does actually.
[18:44:17] <bRinbg> basic question are there differences between upload image from gallery and take new photo and upload upload?
[18:44:40] <bRinbg> robertmaxrees: ? It does actually?
[18:44:50] <robertmaxrees> there are remote debugging tools available.
[18:45:13] <bRinbg> Hmm, ok, i will search for this
[18:45:19] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not sure about your question.  i might head over to #web and see if they have any input.
[18:46:41] <bRinbg> Ok thank you robertmaxrees i join the channel :-D
[18:46:51] <bRinbg> +r
[18:47:37] <rafuch0> Hi all

[18:48:24] <rafuch0> and check on submit
[18:48:32] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[18:48:48] <rafuch0> if someone can take a look and give me a hint very apprecie it
[18:48:55] <rafuch0> well
[18:49:05] <robertmaxrees> rafuch0 make a jsfiddle as a test case.
[18:49:08] <rafuch0> is  failing and validating the jpeg
[18:49:09] <robertmaxrees> show us where the issues are :)
[18:49:31] <rafuch0> go to to the site
[18:49:45] <robertmaxrees> what site?

[18:51:44] <rafuch0> is perfect
[18:51:53] <rafuch0> i validating
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> also: you're loading jquery and bootstrap in the wrong order.
[18:52:13] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like you need to add the extra jquery validate methods file.
[18:52:40] <rafuch0> i delete those i was trying to make it more simple for me to understand
[18:52:47] <rafuch0> but additial methods ok
[18:52:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:52:52] <rafuch0> i will add
[18:52:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to reorder jquery and bootstrap.
[18:53:03] <robertmaxrees> havbe to load jquery before bootstrap.
[18:53:14] <rafuch0> thanks man
[19:30:02] <gambl0re> hello?
[19:35:15] <AbjectsGuest1197> ask a q

[19:41:24] <robertmaxrees> that's... odd.
[19:41:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean with the picture, right?
[19:41:43] <bRinbg> Yes
[19:42:03] <robertmaxrees> ah
[19:42:11] <robertmaxrees> filesize is likely your culprit
[19:43:39] <bRinbg> i will check now filesize and filetypes :-D
[19:45:07] <i4> hi. Please help me with ".append"
[19:45:22] <i4> https://jsfiddle.net/gagsL9ob/
[19:45:49] <i4> I have an .append('canvas') and when I browse my site and use BACK func in browser mu .append is doubled
[19:46:11] <i4> http://www.ada.aero/en
[19:46:16] <robertmaxrees> "doubled" meaning...
[19:46:17] <i4> Source site is
[19:46:26] <robertmaxrees> it appends a second canvas, or it runs the append twice?
[19:46:27] <i4> Doubled meaning that i have two canvas, not one
[19:46:44] <i4> If I use browser funcs forward back again - it will be three canvas and etc
[19:46:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:47:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're not removing the last canvas.
[19:47:05] <i4> I try to understand how can I use something like .replace and not .append or add .empty first
[19:47:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:47:18] <i4> I was tried to use .empty but no lick
[19:47:20] <i4> luck
[19:47:31] <robertmaxrees> d3.select('div#planet').empty() ?
[19:47:46] <i4> It's not clears first canvas but adds second one
[19:48:02] <i4> d3.select('div#planet').empty() i was tried but no luck - planet is not displayed
[19:48:03] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id=planet]').length) - what does that return?
[19:48:12] <i4> ja,
[19:48:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:49:46] <i4> I'm sorry but where I must use console.log($('[id=planet]').length)
[19:49:50] <i4> In the sorce code?
[19:49:59] <robertmaxrees> pop it after that line, sure.
[19:50:06] <i4> And if it is correct, where I must check then
[19:50:07] <robertmaxrees> after your canvas =
[19:50:39] <i4> https://i.imgur.com/V4Hhwax.png
[19:50:41] <i4> Like this?
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:50:56] <gambl0re> hey robert, hows going?
[19:51:07] <robertmaxrees> i4 i don't know coffeescript so i'm not 100% sure
[19:51:32] <i4> robertmaxrees, and when I must check after that? In my firefox browser for example
[19:51:42] <robertmaxrees> in your dev tools console, yeah
[19:51:47] <gambl0re> hey robertmaxrees i didnt pm you this time..
[19:51:54] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re grats?
[19:51:59] <i4> https://i.imgur.com/oL37ti7.png
[19:52:01] <gambl0re> hows going?
[19:52:12] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question gambl0re or...?
[19:52:29] <gambl0re> whats up?
[19:52:42] <robertmaxrees> i4 it's almost like you're getting a new d3 instance every pageload.
[19:53:02] <robertmaxrees> try doing just $('#planet').empty(); the line before canvas =
[19:53:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if that fixes it.
[19:56:27] <i4> robertmaxrees, yes it's working! Thanks!
[19:56:42] <i4> You are awesome :)
[19:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i4 ah, heh, then yeah.  you've got some jank going on with d3.
[19:56:55] <robertmaxrees> also: coffeescript is basically dead ;)
[19:57:30] <i4> Why dead?
[19:57:58] <robertmaxrees> imo it doesn't really offer anything useful these days.
[19:58:17] <robertmaxrees> plus it makes it harder to get help.
[20:03:43] <i4> robertmaxrees, hmm ok
[20:04:18] <i4> but it's more user friendly IMHO
[20:04:23] <robertmaxrees> why?
[20:04:36] <i4> More clean
[20:04:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree with that :)
[20:04:49] <i4> :)
[20:05:02] <i4> I don't need commas and brackets "{"
[20:05:13] <i4> And this is more simple for me
[20:05:15] <i4> Not?
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> when you're writing code it may seem that way.
[20:05:57] <robertmaxrees> but if you're like a lot of engineers, you're not writing code as much as you're reading it.
[20:06:07] <i4> hmmhesays, you right
[20:06:59] <robertmaxrees> those "extra characters" can be critical for understanding what's going on.
[20:07:16] <robertmaxrees> also: don't conflate "simple" with "better"
[20:07:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:07:25] <i4> You right again
[20:07:32] <i4> :)
[20:07:40] <i4> Thanks for your help, and advices!
[20:07:47] <robertmaxrees> definitely
[20:07:58] <robertmaxrees> s'what we're here for - troubleshooting and unsolicited advice ;)
[20:10:43] <i4> :)))
[20:24:04] <bRinbg> robertmaxrees: Yes its not a Mobile problem, it looks a problem with the size (New Photo has a larger size, as the fotos from Libary)
[20:24:09] <bRinbg> thank you
