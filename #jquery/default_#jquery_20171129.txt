[00:02:51] <Darmani> Hi everyone! I have a form using google's autocomplete and I want it to automatically submit when a user selects a value. Kinda like Google maps does.
[00:02:59] <Darmani> What event am I looking for exactly?
[00:19:44] <Darmani> nvm got it
[01:36:19] <sippan2k> hello
[01:36:27] <sippan2k> $( '#inputfields' ).change(function() {  var test5 = ($(this).val());
[01:36:36] <sippan2k> why wont that work? there are several #inputfields
[01:36:52] <sippan2k> i want value of the one that changed
[01:55:52] <Cork> sippan2k: that should work just fine (though i don't know why you have the extra () around .val())
[01:57:16] <sippan2k> hm maybe that
[01:57:59] <sippan2k> but i found out html had onchange="func(this.value)" which worked fine in my case
[02:05:35] <Cork> sippan2k: you should avoid the old dom0 event attributes
[02:05:48] <Cork> they don't play well with modern event handlers
[02:22:01] <sippan2k> Cork: dom0 is what I did?:)
[02:22:20] <Cork> ya, i got that and i strongly recommend against it
[02:22:28] <sippan2k> hm ok
[02:22:52] <sippan2k> ok, thanks. I'll get back to the issue later then
[04:44:27] <traptrip> is there any way to 'reset' an animationend event? I have a little notification element that may trigger multiple times, and on each instance, I need to reset the previous animationend. I'm not yet getting it right, and would love some input. fiddle up at https://jsfiddle.net/Lh6gn138/
[04:45:22] <traptrip> I tried using .off(), combined with .remove() -- hoping that removing it from the DOM might also remove the animation timing properties
[04:46:01] <Woet> traptrip: what did you google for so far?
[04:47:38] <traptrip> Woet, a few queries like 'reset css animationend', nothing gave me the clue that I need
[04:48:10] <traptrip> I want to keep the timing pure css, if possible. I only saw a bunch of solutions using setTimeout/clearTimeout -- and I would know how to make my way around that
[04:48:42] <traptrip> but like I say, that's not what I want
[04:49:41] <Woet> traptrip: my bad, thought you were using jQuery animations, seeing as you were asking in #jquery
[04:49:43] <Cork> traptrip: looks like you replace the element and that is why you lose the event handler
[04:50:17] <traptrip> Woet, I'm sorry, should have been more specific. this is a css/jQuery codependent issue, and I figured it belonged here more than in #css :)
[04:50:24] <Woet> traptrip: thats alright
[04:51:42] <traptrip> Cork: I removed the handler on purpose, hoping that the animationend wouldn't trigger -- the purpose in the fiddle is to 'restart' the animationend on every button press c.q. new instance of top-notification-box
[04:53:32] <Cork> traptrip: the only thing i see laying around is the shader
[04:54:01] <traptrip> Cork, yes, but I'm not watching an animationend for .shader?
[04:54:20] <Cork> what does that matter?
[04:54:32] <traptrip> then I don't understand what you mean
[04:54:34] <Cork> when you remove the box you remove the event so the remove never trigger
[04:54:47] <Cork> .shader').remove(); <--
[04:55:11] <traptrip> I still don't follow
[04:55:37] <traptrip> both are removed when animationend fires, but I don't want animationend to fire for as long as there is a 'fresh' instance of top-notification-box
[04:55:45] <Cork> what i see when i click the button in the jsfiddle is the test message animate and gets removed and start a new on new presses
[04:55:53] <Cork> but the shader gets duplicated
[04:56:13] <Cork> so the page get progressively black
[04:57:02] <traptrip> Cork, actually no, .shader doesn't get duplicated
[04:57:18] <traptrip> there is only one .shader element in the DOM
[04:58:17] <traptrip> the problem seems to be that animationend is firing for the first top-notification-box, and I need to remove that animation altogether whne a new one is triggered
[04:58:27] <traptrip> when *
[04:59:11] <HomeDope> Hi all
[04:59:20] <Cork> hmm
[04:59:36] <Cork> traptrip: btw why are you using animation and not transition?
[04:59:41] <HomeDope> Could someone help me with couple simple jquery functions? They work but Not sure If I could just put them in smaller and more efficient way?
[04:59:56] <Cork> HomeDope: ask the question not for someone to help
[05:00:38] <HomeDope> https://pastebin.com/6tUXSfkH
[05:01:06] <HomeDope> WIll do thanks.
[05:01:20] <HomeDope> I think there must be more efficient way of doing what I do in the script
[05:02:31] <Woet> HomeDope: share what you tried so far
[05:02:37] <traptrip> Cork, because I need keyframes for what I'm doing
[05:02:39] <Cork> HomeDope: could you provide what you're working with in https://jsfiddle.net/pp992537/1/ ?
[05:02:49] <HomeDope> Sure thing. Give me a sec
[05:02:58] <HomeDope> I've never used jsfiddle
[05:03:50] <Cork> ah, right >_<' the transition functions haven't landed yet...
[05:04:02] <Cork> (me beeing too deep into csswg)
[05:05:15] <Cork> traptrip: ya, then you would have to do is have a class that forces the element into a none animated state and then remove the class again to restart the animation
[05:08:03] <HomeDope> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/pp992537/5/
[05:08:18] <Woet> HomeDope: and now your attempt at optimizing it
[05:08:21] <HomeDope> It doesn't looks exactly how it shows for me in browser.
[05:08:42] <HomeDope> But what Im trying to do is that I can activate Different Tabs via Drawer Links
[05:09:23] <HomeDope> The current jQeury functions are best that I can do :S
[05:10:56] <HomeDope> Not sure if its possible to detect what I''m clicking and storing it to a variable. Thats how we would only need one function which would be universal.
[05:11:02] <HomeDope> But I have no idea where to start
[05:13:52] <Cork> traptrip: https://jsfiddle.net/2k27sqex/
[05:14:42] <HomeDope> brb
[05:15:43] <Cork> HomeDope: i would base the click handlers on the .mdl-layout__tab class
[05:15:55] <Cork> HomeDope: then you could basically remove all the duplications
[05:16:45] <HomeDope> Like now I have  $('a[href="#scroll-tab-1"]').on('click', function () { Which then will activate Scroll Tab 1
[05:16:58] <Cork> ya, like i said
[05:17:23] <Cork> then you could remove all the duplications for the click handler
[05:17:47] <Cork> for the is-active you could use $($(this).attr('href')).addClass('is-active');
[05:18:00] <HomeDope> But would that idenfity the correct link Im clicking. (This is he first script I've ever done)
[05:18:14] <HomeDope> Ahh I think I understand now
[05:18:46] <HomeDope> Thanks!
[05:19:08] <Cork> np
[06:32:41] <traptrip> Cork, I don't see how that demonstrates a solution to my problem?
[06:33:08] <Cork> traptrip: it resets the animation when you click reset
[06:36:01] <traptrip> Cork, I can see that, but how does that demonstrate that animationend won't fire anyway?
[06:36:41] <Cork> traptrip: cause that would be breaking the spec
[06:36:50] <Cork> aborted animations should not fire animationend
[06:38:21] <traptrip> Cork, spec is irrelevant, what matters is real world implementation, sadly :)
[06:44:03] <Cork> traptrip: and as far as i know it is followed quite well
[06:44:20] <traptrip> Cork, it was a general comment.
[06:44:33] <traptrip> anyway, I think I have a solution now
[06:44:38] <traptrip> thanks for your time
[07:37:48] <Aquazi> can I use jquery in node?
[07:38:06] <Aquazi> I need to parse an xml and the jquery xml api seems exactly what I need
[07:45:03] <Cork> Aquazi: no, you need a dom
[07:45:22] <Cork> you can use phantomjs as an external process in nod and run it there
[07:45:28] <Cork> *node
[07:45:35] <Aquazi> seems like there is a jquery implementation for node
[07:45:39] <Cork> (at least that is how it was last i checked)
[07:45:54] <Aquazi> https://www.npmjs.com/package/jQuery
[07:46:02] <Cork> Aquazi: possibly, but you would have to check if it support dom modifications
[07:46:53] <Aquazi> seems so
[07:58:59] <ace_me> hi
[07:59:33] <ace_me> you all probably know jQuery.extend(jQuery.validator.messages, { in order to override error messages
[08:00:01] <ace_me> I was trying to use a translation class I am using all other places maxlength: jQuery.validator.format(myapp.i18n.t("reapp-validate-maxlength")),
[08:00:24] <ace_me> but it seems the messages are not there
[08:02:36] <ace_me> http://www.marcogermani.it/en/2016/09/28/jquery-validation-plugin-tradurre-messaggi-errore/
[08:03:09] <ace_me> my problem is that I try to use a function in place of "Please enter a value between {0} and {1}."
[08:04:38] <ace_me> hints ?
[08:56:09] <v0lksman> hello all!  I have a 3 image carousel I would like to fill the viewport. I'm looking to find something that will resize the images on load to fit the right aspect ratio and center the images in the viewport (and in the carousel).  Does anyone know of a good client side image resizer or technique?
[08:58:40] <shoky> v0lksman: css is enough.  e.g. background-image  and  background-size: contain  or  background-size: cover   try the different options
[09:04:08] <v0lksman> shoky: I'm using bootstraps carousel so these aren't background images
[09:04:16] <v0lksman> they use a standard img tag
[09:05:54] <thykka> for imgs there is object-fit
[09:06:08] <thykka> object-fit: cover; is largely equivalent to background-size: cover;
[09:06:24] <thykka> provided you set width and height to 100% (or the desired dimensions of the cropped image)
[09:06:32] <shoky> ie11 doesnt support object-fit
[09:06:33] <thykka> IE needs a polyfill though
[09:06:42] <thykka> https://github.com/bfred-it/object-fit-images
[09:10:01] <v0lksman> awesome..thanks!
[09:11:05] <pokmo> hi
[09:11:09] <pokmo> if i have a = new Date; a.getTime() returns 1511964515088
[09:11:12] <pokmo> but 1511964515088 isn't the epoch time, is it?
[09:11:47] <Woet> pokmo: thats not a jquery question
[09:11:56] <Woet> pokmo: and the MDN docs tell you what it returns
[09:23:18] <pokmo> ok thanks
[10:26:16] <elrafael> hello. i'm trying to ask google about a question but I believe I'm doing wrong. Can anyone help me?
[10:26:33] <elrafael> i have an element that doesn't exist on the DOM
[10:26:56] <elrafael> and i need to update things about that element after the load. I know the .on()
[10:27:05] <elrafael> but in this case I just wanna show/hide the element
[10:27:30] <elrafael> like $('#id_of_el').show(); how can I do that in "future" elements?
[10:28:16] <elrafael> i already had some about that, but in those case I have an event, like: $('body').on('click', '#id_of_el', myFunc);
[10:40:50] <ace_me> https://pastebin.com/BFLkQhDj
[10:41:07] <ace_me> Insted of the translation I get the 'message'
[10:41:26] <ace_me> in fact simpe message
[10:41:30] <ace_me> simple*
[10:50:57] <sdaf> Hi
[10:51:01] <sdaf> I have a little big problem..
[10:51:30] <sdaf> I add dynamically fields to form with append but then i dont see them in the post.. Any ideas how to solve this?
[10:56:57] <elrafael> sdaf try this: $(form).serialize and check if the dynamically fields are there
[10:59:23] <sdaf> elrafael: okay
[11:01:43] <sdaf> its not in there..
[11:07:14] <FilipNortic> sdaf: what about $('#formid>input')
[11:07:33] <FilipNortic> wait that's only direct decends
[11:07:54] <FilipNortic> $("#formid').find('input')
[11:09:10] <FilipNortic> and try adding a class to the new ones then you can try and select one of them in the console and see what where they are placed
[11:14:12] <taplar> are the inputs being appended before the submit happens?
[11:15:02] <taplar> and have you verified that they have a name set on them?
[11:45:08] <jquery728> If I have a div of <span>s and wanted to .split() off them by the space inbetween each one, which is better to use? .split(' ') or .split('&nbsp;')? Or are these the same?
[11:54:44] <FilipNortic> depends som on encoding but space should work
[11:55:28] <FilipNortic> but i don't now what you are trying to do
[12:04:12] <jquery728> @FilipNortic Basically my script pulls a bunch of options into a div, then I append those options to check boxes. I was running into an issue where if there were multiple divs it said "topic 1 topic2" on the checkbox, so I was trying to figure out how to split them
[12:06:14] <FilipNortic> jquery728:  well .split('') should work then
[12:06:24] <FilipNortic> split(' ' );
[12:25:00] <JeanMarques> Alguém do Brasil?
[13:19:18] <poboy> How can i disable the first option in this dropdown box?  I don't want the user to see it.  https://jsfiddle.net/y1y39qmx/
[14:17:11] <ExeciN> hey people, I'm using this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3100870ed361e318252a88086bb6b19b to scroll to the element specified when clicked (I think I could have used $(this) instead of specifying it again but this isn't my problem at this time)
[14:18:00] <ExeciN> the code works when pasted to the browser console but it doesn't work when I include it in my page
[15:13:06] <catbadger> hey all
[15:18:34] <catbadger> I just got banned from the JavaScript chat on SO... for stating that a conversation about gays and anti-gays was offtopic.. it's ok i prefer it in here anyway.
[15:21:22] <Aquazi> anybody ever used cheerio here?
[15:21:26] <Aquazi> I'm trying to parse this xml
[15:22:19] <Aquazi> https://gist.github.com/VulcanRav/abc95648a8a140264e570c5d26261d66
[15:22:30] <catbadger> Aquazi why?
[15:22:36] <catbadger> what's the usecase for cheerio?
[15:22:40] <Aquazi> $("Relationship").attr("id");
[15:22:40] <Aquazi>  doesn't work tho
[15:22:48] <Aquazi> I need to extract the ID's from it
[15:23:28] <Aquazi> they refer to files in another xml
[15:23:46] <Aquazi> and I need those references to extract images and order them in yet another file
[15:23:52] <Aquazi> but I suck with xml parsing
[15:23:56] <catbadger> why are you using cheerio?
[15:24:03] <catbadger> why not use core js?
[15:24:19] <catbadger> or better yet an xml library
[15:26:04] <catbadger> Aquazi https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14890655/the-best-node-module-for-xml-parsing
[15:39:12] <grapheti> Aquazi: var IDs = []  $("Relationship").map(function() { return IDs.push(this.id) })
[15:55:06] <Aquazi> grapheti,
[15:55:07] <Aquazi> thx
[15:55:20] <grapheti> np
[15:55:29] <Aquazi> in the same gist, (I'm still learning) I don't really understand what parent() does
[15:55:44] <grapheti> what do you think it does?
[15:55:57] <Aquazi> gives me back the entire object
[15:56:19] <Aquazi> I think..
[15:56:38] <grapheti> what do the docs say?
[15:56:45] <Aquazi> I don't really understand them
[15:57:00] <catbadger> ^
[15:57:00] <grapheti> use jquery docs
[15:57:19] <Aquazi> Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.
[15:57:26] <catbadger> Aquazi is misusing jquery to do what an xml lib should be doing...
[15:57:38] <Aquazi> other xml libraries suck dicks
[15:57:49] <Aquazi> or I'm even worse at using them :(
[15:57:57] <catbadger> jquery isn't an xml library. you don't understand documentation... what sucks what now?
[15:58:16] <grapheti> Aquazi: also try for yourself
[15:58:18] <grapheti> https://jsfiddle.net/ebLeftmc/
[15:58:20] <grapheti> look in the console
[15:58:32] <grapheti> what's the first array item say?
[15:59:09] <Aquazi> if I press run nothing happens
[15:59:22] <grapheti> I see this: [div.parent, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init(1)]
[15:59:26] <grapheti> you don't see that in the console?
[15:59:36] <Aquazi> nope
[16:00:01] <Aquazi> ok refreshed
[16:00:13] <grapheti> what's the first array item?
[16:00:42] <catbadger> grapheti haz patience
[16:00:47] <Aquazi> 0: div.parent
[16:00:52] <grapheti> there ya go
[16:01:02] <grapheti> it seems it goes up an element
[16:01:24] <grapheti> cause we gave it child
[16:01:39] <grapheti> and it went up a div and gave us .parent
[16:03:41] <Aquazi> in the end it returns an object
[16:04:06] <grapheti> yeah, it's going up the DOM
[16:04:27] <grapheti> and it's a jquery object
[16:04:39] <Aquazi> I guess cheerio gives me a jquery object too
[16:04:51] <grapheti> similar I would think
[16:05:34] <grapheti> you can always get the html version via .html()
[16:05:56] <amundir> get()
[16:06:04] <grapheti> ^
[16:06:09] <amundir> or prop('outerHTML')
[16:07:20] <Aquazi> can't really understands what happens here tho
[16:07:21] <Aquazi> https://jsfiddle.net/ebLeftmc/1/
[16:07:36] <Aquazi> wait
[16:07:42] <grapheti> do you see a .child in your html?
[16:07:48] <grapheti> it needs a target
[16:07:49] <Aquazi> https://jsfiddle.net/ebLeftmc/2/
[16:08:37] <grapheti> what's the first array item you see?
[16:08:56] <Aquazi> 0:relationships
[16:08:57] <Aquazi> it's okay
[16:09:26] <grapheti> that's what it's returning
[16:09:45] <grapheti> relationships is up one
[16:09:46] <Aquazi> yeah, not cheerio tho, it returns: initialize {
[16:09:46] <Aquazi>   '0':
[16:09:46] <Aquazi>    { type: 'tag',
[16:09:47] <Aquazi>      name: 'Relationships',
[16:09:47] <Aquazi>      attribs:
[16:09:51] <Aquazi> oops sorry
[16:10:01] <catbadger> Aquazi... what's this code for?
[16:10:17] <amundir> https://jsfiddle.net/ebLeftmc/3/
[16:11:05] <Aquazi> I need to retrieve the Id's from this document
[16:11:07] <catbadger> no i mean, your job? school? just for fun?
[16:11:14] <Aquazi> personal project
[16:11:31] <Aquazi> nono, I'm a chemist :D
[16:11:56] <Aquazi> having fun creating a program for my gf, then....I got into xml...
[16:12:11] <Aquazi> and document conversions and encoding and stuff
[16:12:15] <amundir> my condolences
[16:12:42] <grapheti> What you doin' with cheerio and xml? Go do what chemist do best, make a bomb.
[16:12:43] <catbadger> haha
[16:13:02] <Aquazi> I like programming tho and learning new stuff, guess my basics ain't very strong for some stuff
[16:13:15] <Aquazi> prefer to code than be in lab tbh
[16:13:27] <cerion> hi. Can I know/detect when a page is relaoded from cache ? to update it via ajax then ?
[16:13:51] <catbadger> cerion what?
[16:13:51] <grapheti> Maybe you found your passion.
[16:14:20] <grapheti> If it's worth struggling for and you love to do, may consider changing professions Aquazi
[16:14:28] <grapheti> to do it*
[16:14:29] <Aquazi> yes I very like to do so
[16:14:37] <Aquazi> solving problems, ecc
[16:14:49] <catbadger> what do you make as a chemist?
[16:14:58] <cerion> catbadger: say I have a page that reload an image every minute. But when it's reloaded from cache the image is from the cache and could ve very old. So instead of waiting one minute, I want the page to be refreshed with a new image right away.
[16:15:16] <Aquazi> my job is opening containers, taking a sample, prepare a solution, run a test, if test is bad repeat the whole process till its good...
[16:15:30] <Aquazi> quality control in pharma
[16:15:51] <Aquazi> doesn't even pay that well
[16:15:55] <grapheti> cerion: cache: false
[16:16:07] <amundir> that's a pretty common task in various jobs
[16:16:19] <Aquazi> yeah sure, that's why I prefer programming
[16:16:30] <Aquazi> at least I feel some sense of accomplishment learning something
[16:16:34] <Aquazi> or solving a problem
[16:16:38] <amundir> i did something along those lines at a generator area, and my bro n law did something like that at a oil place
[16:16:38] <Aquazi> in my job, there's nothing like that
[16:18:48] <cerion> grapheti: well. I do not do ajax. in fact, I just change the src attribute of the image. so may be change the header to no cache the image then ?
[16:19:24] <catbadger> cerion manage the cache beforehand
[16:19:35] <catbadger> use cachebusting
[16:21:03] <grapheti> damn it taplar
[16:21:08] <taplar> wut?
[16:21:09] <grapheti> I didn't know it was you.
[16:21:13] <taplar> :D
[16:21:15] <taplar> kinda the point
[16:21:16] <grapheti> :P

[16:30:05] <Azrael_-> hi
[16:30:22] <taplar> bonjour
[16:30:38] <grapheti> knee how
[16:31:11] <Azrael_-> i want to create a popup (a real new window, no modal dialog), but i miserably fail to find an example. can you guide me? (it isn't allowed to open in a new tab of the browser)
[16:31:30] <taplar> uh, that's not really in your control
[16:31:42] <taplar> the browser settings determine if it will be a new window or a new tab
[16:32:50] <taplar> but the ##javascript method for that is window.open
[16:32:53] <Azrael_-> the big problem: the users which will use this (inhouse) site aren't really skilled and moving just a tab to the secondary screen is too much for them. so i have to create a new window (doesn't even need the browserbar and everything) to allow them grabbing the one
[16:33:19] <taplar> again, not something you can control from javascript
[16:33:25] <Azrael_-> i love it :D
[16:33:27] <Azrael_-> thanks
[16:35:40] <taplar> or i'm wrong
[16:35:41] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/726761/javascript-open-in-a-new-window-not-tab#726803
[16:37:06] <grapheti> How do I open in another dimension?
[16:37:26] <taplar> it involves drugs
[16:37:32] <grapheti> LMAO
[16:37:34] <Azrael_-> taplar: only works up to ff 11
[16:38:02] <taplar> ask around ##javascript.  see what those peeps say
[16:39:04] <Azrael_-> taplar: already at it, thanks
[16:39:14] <taplar> sure, gl
[16:39:46] <Azrael_-> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Lk7kjbw7/
[16:40:24] <taplar> worked in my chrome whatever version
[16:40:36] <Azrael_-> yeah, works here too. so just perfect
[16:40:59] <grapheti> more porn popups, yay!
[16:41:10] <taplar> heh
[16:41:26] <taplar> yeah that's sadly why i actually searched for it.  cause i remembered i'd seen a new window pop open
[16:41:42] <grapheti> :P
[16:44:53] <taplar> now i'm curious if you could make a greasemonkey script or something to redefine window.open to kill those kinds of ads
[16:45:00] <taplar> :o
[16:45:07] <taplar> never thought of that
[16:45:16] <grapheti> be a great chrome extension
[16:45:27] <fireboi[m]> does Date work with something like Date ("2017", "5".............) ?
[16:45:29] <grapheti> unless it's already made
[16:45:49] <taplar> fireboi[m]: try it and see?
[16:46:13] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/prototype
[16:46:13] <fireboi[m]> i was hoping for a quickie
[16:46:21] <taplar> mmm, yeah boi
[16:46:41] <grapheti> under the table
[16:46:48] <taplar> new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);
[16:46:50] <taplar> from the docs
[16:47:01] <grapheti> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-up-blocker-for-chrome/bkkbcggnhapdmkeljlodobbkopceiche?hl=en
[16:47:18] <taplar> year month, required, others are optional in that format
[16:47:30] <taplar> so, yes, :)
[16:47:55] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[16:48:11] <taplar> though it says Integers so you may have to parseInt those strings
[16:48:18] <fireboi[m]>       var arrDate = new Date(parseInt(nums[0]), parseInt(nums[1]) - 1, parseInt(nums[2]));
[16:48:19] <fireboi[m]> so this is useless xD
[16:48:27] <taplar> and month is zero based
[16:48:53] <fireboi[m]> yeah ik
[16:48:57] <taplar> no, that looks accurate
[16:49:01] <fireboi[m]> but only ints
[16:49:08] <taplar> right
[16:49:27] <fireboi[m]> so it cant handle strings ;)
[16:49:36] <fireboi[m]> lol
[16:49:37] <fireboi[m]> ok
[16:49:38] <taplar> natively, riht
[16:49:41] <taplar> *right
[16:50:54] <fireboi[m]> ok thx :)
