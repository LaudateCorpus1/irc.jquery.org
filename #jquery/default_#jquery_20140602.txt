[01:05:28] <frank_o> I got this Selectize (fancy select) here: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/3/ -- but why won't it change from `Choose option` to `Search...` on click?
[01:12:06] <Cork> frank_o: looks like the plugin uses return false;
[01:12:09] <Cork> so you can't grab the click
[01:12:21] <Cork> (without patching the plugin)
[01:14:02] <frank_o> Cork: oh ok.. thanks for letting me know !
[01:14:07] <Cork> np
[01:14:26] <Cork> frank_o: also unless the plugin fakes the click event on the original select element
[01:14:37] <Cork> you can't bind it on "select" as it isn't the one actually used
[01:15:32] <frank_o> ah yeah good point..
[01:15:41] <frank_o> i shoulda thought of that :)
[01:15:52] <Cork> but ya, that doesn't help
[01:16:02] <frank_o> hehe damnit !!
[01:16:09] <Cork> the plugin kills the event so you can't do anything without patching it
[01:16:45] <Cork> oh...
[01:16:48] <Cork> *or
[01:18:36] <frank_o> Cork: whatcha thinking?
[01:19:01] <Cork> i'll get back to you if i can get the hack working
[01:19:04] <Cork> but... not sure
[01:19:50] <Cork> heh nope...
[01:20:03] <frank_o> :))
[01:20:12] <frank_o> ill get back to you as well
[01:20:24] <frank_o> if i find something
[01:20:52] <e01> hello
[01:21:11] <e01> i am getting Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #  error in my console, any ideas how can i debug what is causing it
[01:21:17] <BaNzounet> Hey guys, do you know why this : `$('html').animate({'margin-top':'+= 50'}, 150);` is not working for instance on this website : http://www.eleventwofm.com ?
[01:22:02] <Cork> e01: your sending a string that jquery tries to use as a selector
[01:22:02] <e01> version is 1.4.4 and i am using drupal so there is a lot of modules  and code is not mine so stepping every file and line is not the solution here
[01:22:25] <Cork> e01: if you have a html string that has leading spaces you can get this effect
[01:22:55] <BaNzounet> Mhum It was because of the space
[01:23:33] <e01> Cork: thanks, any ideas how can i debug the backtrace when it fail on it?
[01:23:59] <Cork> e01: put a breakpoint at the exception and backtrace from there is normally the simplest
[01:24:24] <Cork> BaNzounet: there isn't any animation margin-top in that page
[01:24:59] <UpstateWeb> Anyone give me a clue on how to make the jQuery AutoComplete ComboBox allow new user information? It will only submit content found in the list.
[01:25:30] <Cork> UpstateWeb: you prob need to handle the enter key
[01:25:38] <Cork> as it will pick the selected entry in the dropdown
[01:25:49] <Cork> alternatively set it to not autoselect the first entry
[01:26:20] <UpstateWeb> That's what I have been trying to do for 4 das. I am new to jQuery and trying to learn.
[01:26:34] <UpstateWeb> I am just stumped with this.
[01:27:40] <sacho> test case?
[01:28:19] <UpstateWeb> I need an old fashioned combobox like I used for years that allowed the user to use it as an input or select list. I used javascript to do it for years and now want a jQuery solution.
[01:29:37] <Cork> UpstateWeb: actually that shouldn't be a problem
[01:29:41] <Cork> it should work by default
[01:29:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/XKLUF/
[01:31:51] <UpstateWeb> That does work. I will try to find a way to add a drop down arrow and make it more dynamic in the case of 4 or 5 instances on a page. Any suggestions where I can look to learn.
[01:32:44] <Cork> UpstateWeb: the jquery ui demo page
[01:32:55] <Cork> it has a lot of demos for many situations
[01:33:09] <UpstateWeb> I have been looking at that for days. Is there a book that will help?
[01:33:10] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[01:33:25] <Cork> donno never looked for one
[01:33:44] <UpstateWeb> I have been trying to use the autocomplete, but it will not allow the user to input new date. Only data in the list.
[01:34:07] <Uhkis> UpstateWeb: check out this project: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[01:34:08] <UpstateWeb> The version offered by Cork is closer to what I want. It just needs a drop down arrow
[01:35:20] <UpstateWeb> Uhkis, thanks for the suggestion but all of those do the same thing and do not allow for new data. I have seen these in my search for an answer.
[01:36:05] <UpstateWeb> I am also looking for something that can work with a select option like Autocomplete so I don't have to rewrite too much code in my CMS.
[01:36:44] <Uhkis> "If you need to update the options in your select field and want Chosen to pick up the changes, you'll need to trigger the "chosen:updated" event on the field. Chosen will re-build itself based on the updated content."
[01:37:09] <Cork> Uhkis: he wants the user to be able to enter something not known
[01:37:24] <Cork> not dynamically add new entries to the list
[01:38:32] <UpstateWeb> Cork, using your code as a starting point I found this http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/CDYBk/1/
[01:39:07] <UpstateWeb> It does the same thing as your code only adds a drop down button.
[01:40:50] <UpstateWeb> Cork, you are correct about what I am trying to do. Your solution is the closest I have seen. I would like to make it work with a true html select option.
[01:41:08] <Cork> UpstateWeb: you can't type in a <select> element
[01:41:12] <Cork> so that isn't possible
[01:42:19] <UpstateWeb> You can with the jQuery autocomplete. Isn't that a mix of an input and select like the old javascript combobox?
[01:42:40] <Cork> UpstateWeb: no it is an input field and a ul with lis
[01:42:57] <Cork> there isn't any select element in use for it
[01:43:56] <UpstateWeb> I have autocomplete with the combobox feature working on my site and it uses a <select>
[01:44:12] <UpstateWeb> I can see where you are coming from though
[01:44:13] <Cork> UpstateWeb: if you can type in it then it replaces it on load
[01:44:21] <Cork> you can't type in select boxes
[01:44:27] <UpstateWeb> Okay. that makes sense
[01:44:59] <UpstateWeb> I will go with the solution you offered and the one I found
[01:45:24] <UpstateWeb> Thanks Cork. You have been very helpful
[01:47:54] <UpstateWeb> Cork, is there a way to split up the code so I can include the script that runs the combobox so that I can have several instances on a page. This would make it more flexible than having to write the code over and over again if I have more than one need for a combobox on a page.
[01:48:57] <Cork> UpstateWeb: the demo is extremely basic
[01:49:09] <UpstateWeb> okay
[01:49:12] <Cork> autocomplete is very dynamic in how it works and you can do most anything with it
[01:49:30] <Cork> read the demo and api page about it and you will find that you can pass functions or urls instead of the array
[01:50:06] <UpstateWeb> Okay. Thanks.I am just trying to learn jQuery as quick as I can as it seems to be taking over...
[01:56:49] <K-202> var row = $("<row></row>"); valueNode.append(row);  //valueNode is jQuery containing IXMLDOMElement and IE throws "incompatible types"
[01:57:34] <K-202> and row is jQuery containing DispHTMLGenericElement
[01:57:51] <K-202> how can i fix it?
[01:59:26] <Cork> K-202: you can't use $() to generate the xml
[01:59:30] <Cork> it will be html not xml
[02:00:10] <Cork> valueNode.ownerDocument.createElement('row')
[02:05:40] <K-202> Cork: valueNode.ownerDocument is undefined in IE8
[02:06:07] <Cork> K-202: it is the xml document
[02:06:31] <Cork> you might have to keep a reference to it manually
[02:13:47] <hinogi> Good morning
[02:29:31] <SBC> Hi
[02:29:38] <SBC> need some help with jquery selector
[02:31:01] <Guest89605> How to get the value of the second column, when I know the value of first column ?
[02:35:21] <K-202> $(xmlElement).html() - doesn't work, I want to add some &nbsp; and how to?
[02:41:26] <sacho> what are you trying to do
[02:41:45] <Guest89605> i have a table
[02:42:02] <Guest89605> first column has the checkbox , and second column has the value with it
[02:42:30] <Guest89605> when i select the checkbox, i should add the value that is associated with it in the second column
[02:42:48] <Guest89605> similarly, when i unselect the checkbox, i should subtract the number
[02:43:09] <sacho> ok
[02:43:40] <Guest89605> $("input [name*='VPROC']").parent(),parent().parent()
[02:44:00] <Guest89605> this gives me access to TR..
[02:44:21] <Guest89605> i need to get value of the second <td> element from it
[02:45:01] <sacho> $(input).closest('tr').find('td').eq(1)
[02:46:19] <Bernardao> hello
[02:47:19] <Bernardao> Im trying to print values received by an Ajax call, but seems the data Im receiving it is a string and I would like to receive it like an array or json
[02:47:37] <Guest89605> great that worked
[02:47:37] <Guest89605> @sacho.. thanks a lo
[02:47:37] <Guest89605> thanks a lot..
[02:47:43] <Bernardao> $.get(
[02:47:43] <Bernardao> 		"/compra/datos-de-pago",
[02:47:43] <Bernardao> 		{pagar: 1})
[02:47:43] <Bernardao> 		.done(function(data){
[02:47:43] <Bernardao> 			console.log(data);
[02:47:44] <Bernardao> 			alert(data);
[02:47:44] <Bernardao> 			alert(data[0]);
[02:47:45] <Bernardao> 		}, 'json'
[02:47:45] <Bernardao> 	).fail(
[02:47:46] <Cork> Bernardao: json is a string
[02:47:46] <Bernardao> 		function() {
[02:47:46] <Bernardao> 			alert("FAIL");
[02:47:47] <Bernardao> 	});
[02:47:48] <Guest89605> By the way, i did this long way of doing ... $("input[name*='VPROC']").parent().parent().parent().children().eq(1).text()
[02:47:51] <Cork> Bernardao: don't post code in the channel
[02:47:53] <Cork> ?p
[02:47:55] <sacho> don't paste in channel, Bernardao , read the topic
[02:48:03] <Bernardao> oopps, sorry
[02:48:35] <sacho> so what is the data you are getting
[02:48:42] <Bernardao> how can I access diferent parts of my json string?
[02:49:05] <Cork> Bernardao: you parse it to a javascript array/object
[02:49:24] <sacho> why are you passing 'json' to your .done() function?
[02:49:26] <Cork> Bernardao: and if the server doesn't lie about what it sends you will get that by default
[02:49:27] <Bernardao> {"compra": "12232232","Merchant": "John"}
[02:50:04] <sacho> pass it as a parameter to $.get()
[02:50:05] <Cork> Bernardao: set the server to send content-type: application/json
[02:50:09] <Cork> and it will just work
[02:50:29] <Cork> sacho: $.get doesn't take a dataType argument
[02:50:37] <sacho> it does
[02:51:00] <Cork> huh... your right
[02:52:13] <Cork> anyway that is just affecting the accept header
[02:52:21] <Cork> the problem is from the content-type
[02:52:59] <Bernardao> how can I set the server to contect-type: application/json?
[02:53:13] <Cork> Bernardao: depends on the language
[02:53:16] <sacho> I assumed it would also try to parse any response from the specific format
[02:53:30] <Cork> sacho: no no sniffing is used
[02:53:45] <Cork> if you send text/html jquery won't try to take it as javascript
[02:54:07] <Cork> sniffing bytes in a stream is normally a bad idea
[02:54:46] <sacho> I meant if you pass a json dataType, jquery would ignore the contentType and try to parse it as json regardless
[02:55:17] <sacho> not something I've ever had to test (:
[02:55:27] <Cork> no it doesn't
[02:55:37] <Cork> dataType doesn't override what the server says
[02:55:55] <Bernardao> I can't understand you
[02:56:14] <Cork> dataType: 'json' means the header accept: application/json; */* is sent
[02:56:17] <Bernardao> from my php I'm doing json_encode
[02:56:25] <Cork> Bernardao: ok so your using php
[02:56:29] <Bernardao> yes
[02:56:31] <sacho> set a header() with what cork said
[02:56:41] <Cork> then you need to call header('content-type', 'application/json');
[02:56:44] <Bernardao> a header in my php or in my js?
[02:56:48] <Cork> php
[02:56:57] <Bernardao> I can't change it
[02:57:00] <K-202> $(xmlElement).text('&nbsp;'); //instead of hard spaces I can see &nbsp; on screen
[02:57:13] <Cork> Bernardao: ugg... your php script is broken
[02:57:33] <Cork> Bernardao: well the alternative is to take the html and force parse it as json in the callback
[02:57:41] <seutje> K-202: I guess u'll need to use html if you don't want jQuery to escape it for you
[02:58:00] <K-202> seutje: .html() doesn't work because it's XML element
[02:58:08] <Cork> Bernardao: var obj = JSON.parse(data);
[02:58:10] <Bernardao> Cork I think that is what I want to achieve
[02:58:20] <Cork> Bernardao: but you should REALLY ask someone to fix the broken server script
[02:58:30] <Bernardao> ok, I will try it
[02:58:34] <Bernardao> thank you very much
[02:58:47] <Cork> cause sending json and telling the world you send text/html is really wrong
[02:59:10] <seutje> K-202: XML doesn't know nbsp, does it?
[02:59:12] <Bernardao> where I am telling it is text/html?
[02:59:41] <Cork> Bernardao: if you don't in php say you send json (with header) you get the default content-type; meaning text/html
[02:59:56] <Bernardao> ok
[03:00:09] <Cork> and that is why you don't get an object in the callback
[03:00:09] <Bernardao> I'll recheck it
[03:00:19] <Cork> cause jquery thinks you send html so it gives you the string
[03:00:52] <seutje> K-202: should probably use &#160; instead
[03:14:31] <frank_o> Do you guys prefer to add $ in front of your variables?
[03:14:52] <seutje> only for jQuery collections, personally
[03:15:09] <frank_o> nice
[03:15:27] <Cork> frank_o: i usually don't
[03:16:11] <frank_o> :)
[03:19:11] <K-202> Any trick to make empty cells display in Ie 7 with jQuery?
[03:19:57] <seutje> K-202: fill it with something
[03:20:10] <xec> $("td:empty").html(" "); ?
[03:20:28] <xec> iirc an empty space does the trick
[03:20:50] <seutje> prolly, don't have an IE7 at hand to try
[03:21:14] <Fernandos> hi
[03:21:54] <K-202> xec: unfortunately it doesn't work - <td><div>   </div></td> and still cell doesn't display
[03:22:12] <xec> so they are not empty then :)
[03:22:24] <Fernandos> Is something obviously wrong with this promise? http://hastebin.com/inonezopib.js
[03:22:26] <seutje> heh
[03:23:52] <Cork> Fernandos: the promise is pointless
[03:24:08] <sacho> $() is a deferred?
[03:24:15] <Cork> Fernandos: the queue is per element, so as you animate child elements you can't promise for them on infoabar
[03:24:20] <Fernandos> Cork: yeah, it's somehow never reached..
[03:24:32] <Cork> also the return in the done isn't useful
[03:24:48] <Cork> Fernandos: ya, cause you don't have any animation to trigger the promise on that element
[03:24:49] <seutje> sacho: even {} is
[03:25:16] <sacho> uh, I'm pretty sure {} doesn't have a promise method
[03:25:44] <Fernandos> oh my.. :(
[03:26:11] <sacho> What's the promise() on a jquery object for?
[03:26:17] <Cork> Fernandos: promise triggers when an animaton on the element you use for promise ends
[03:26:31] <sacho> ah ok, I found it in the docs
[03:26:34] <Cork> Fernandos: but as you animate child elements you don't ever trigger one, so it isn't ever triggered
[03:27:45] <Fernandos> Cork: hmm.. ok how about adding the fadeOut() ? Also do I really need to select .infoBar > * (just .infoBar won't hide inner elements)
[03:27:57] <seutje> you don't need to return anything, do u? you can just chain the promise on it
[03:28:11] <Cork> Fernandos: it will hide child elements if it has overflow: hidde;
[03:28:15] <Cork> *hidden
[03:38:53] <gnu_d> hi, is there a way to post a downloaded file ? I got a serverside code that generates a file, and now I need to download the file and then post the file to some local server, any ideas ?
[03:39:32] <Fernandos> gnu_d: why would you use js for that? quite simple with curl
[03:39:40] <Cork> gnu_d: ugg your prob better of having the server push it
[03:40:12] <Fernandos> gnu_d: however you only need an ajax GET and POST, if you want to do that client-side.
[03:40:17] <Cork> gnu_d: but technically you can download it as a blob to js and then do a ajax post (if the second server is on the same domain, or allow cors)
[03:40:37] <gnu_d> Fernandos: first of all we don't know the clients ip, or whether the client has a public ip
[03:41:00] <Cork> Fernandos: you would have to use an input type file and manually have the user do the work for that to work "only needing" :)
[03:41:05] <gnu_d> Cork:  how do I download it as a blob ?
[03:41:26] <Fernandos> gnu_d: you could even cache the file inside of localstorage or indexdb and ask for a sha1 hash first, so if the file changed and the hash is different than the one localy stored, you call GET
[03:42:11] <Fernandos> gnu_d: please explain the problem, you're just isolating one single problem, without giving us the context.
[03:42:21] <Cork> gnu_d: you can have XMLHttpRequest fetch the data as a data blob in modern browsers
[03:42:40] <gnu_d> Cork: I'm asking for a jquery approach
[03:43:04] <Cork> gnu_d: not you want a blob and not bytearray, as that will keep it in memory
[03:43:31] <Cork> gnu_d: jquery is a framework for helping using the normal dom functions
[03:43:46] <Cork> gnu_d: you might find a plugin that wrapps this up in a helper for you
[03:43:49] <gnu_d> Cork: I know that, I just need how jquery solved it
[03:43:49] <Cork> but i doubt it
[03:44:03] <Cork> gnu_d: "jquery" doesn't solve it
[03:44:20] <gnu_d> Cork: isn't .ajax part of jquery ?
[03:44:21] <Cork> you rarely need to download data from the server to send it to a second server
[03:44:43] <Cork> gnu_d: sure, but you would have to extend it to get the blob data
[03:45:24] <Fernandos> Cork: ok, now I'm a little baffled, I thought this is how promises work.. http://hastebin.com/raqosimuyi.js
[03:45:25] <Cork> gnu_d: again, why do you need to proxy this over the client?
[03:45:29] <Cork> that just sounds silly
[03:46:02] <Cork> Fernandos: it does, but notice the difference in what element you chain it on
[03:46:13] <gnu_d> Cork: cause in the specification of the local server says I need to upload a file, if there is a file to generate a file on the fly, then convert it to blob, would be helful
[03:46:20] <Fernandos> I agree with Cork, gnu_d you've not explained what you want to actually solve and proxying through the client ain't a good solution
[03:46:37] <Cork> gnu_d: yes, you can generate the data client side
[03:46:53] <gnu_d> Cork: how?
[03:47:04] <Fernandos> Cork: you mean done() ?
[03:47:07] <Cork> "how do you move"
[03:47:19] <Cork> you need to explain what your doing for anyone to answer the question
[03:47:40] <Cork> Fernandos: this example does the fade and the promise on the same element
[03:47:44] <Cork> Fernandos: and that should work
[03:48:02] <Cork> Fernandos: if it doesn't make a live demo (not static code)
[03:52:13] <gnu_d> Cork: is this ok: var data = new Blob(['{"bla":"bla"}'], {type : 'application/json'}); // the blob ?
[03:52:37] <Cork> gnu_d: that creates a blob from an array yes
[03:54:31] <gnu_d> Cork: now how to submit it to a post multipart ?
[03:54:53] <Cork> gnu_d: attach it to a FormData object
[03:54:58] <Cork> ?g mdn FormData
[03:54:59] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[04:00:14] <gnu_d> Cork: weird, it works, but on the other end, it creates a file named blob, instead of the name I gave the file, e.g: formData.append("file", data);
[04:01:36] <Cork> gnu_d: you didn't give it a file name
[04:01:44] <Cork> void append(DOMString name, Blob value, optional DOMString filename);
[04:02:03] <Cork> -------------------------------------------------------------^
[04:02:34] <gnu_d> Cork: so, it's a third parameter
[04:03:19] <gnu_d> Cork: it works, but one question, why it started to give me CORS errors :D
[04:03:44] <gnu_d> Cork: when the file exists on the local server :D
[04:03:46] <Cork> gnu_d: did you do a simple form submit before?
[04:03:55] <gnu_d> Cork: yes
[04:04:04] <Cork> gnu_d: ajax is cors restricted
[04:04:14] <Cork> you can't do ajax calls cross domain unless the server allows it
[04:04:20] <gnu_d> Cork: I know it is, but why it was working
[04:04:37] <Fernandos> Cork: is there another way to wait until the fadeOut() is finished?
[04:04:37] <Cork> cause form submit isn't restricted by cors
[04:04:50] <Cork> Fernandos: you could use the callback from fadeOut
[04:04:55] <gnu_d> Cork: guess the server allows it, but if the file exists, guess it's not handled to return the CORS headers
[04:05:03] <Cork> gnu_d: no
[04:05:16] <Cork> gnu_d: the cors error is the browser giving you
[04:05:28] <Cork> gnu_d: <form> submit isn't restricted by cors
[04:05:32] <Cork> ajax is
[04:05:51] <Cork> so before the browser does an ajax post it contacts the server and checks if it is allowed
[04:06:01] <Cork> if the server says no, or doesn't answer
[04:06:10] <Cork> the browser won't even try to do the post
[04:08:29] <gnu_d> Cork: thanks for pointing me to the FormData :)
[04:08:45] <Cork> np
[04:09:33] <linux_dr> I’m doing some testing on html objects not attached to any document DOM as document fixtures. can jQuery search these with selectors if the root node is provided to jQuery as “context”?
[04:09:56] <Cork> linux_dr: yes
[04:10:29] <linux_dr> Cork: Hmm… Doesn’t seem to be working… let me see where I went wrong.
[04:10:51] <Cork> linux_dr: if you want to file from the top list of elements
[04:10:56] <Cork> you need to use .filter
[04:10:57] <Cork> not .find
[04:11:18] <Cork> $(list_of_dom_objects).filter('#something')
[04:11:38] <linux_dr> I have a unattached div that I’m using as my surrogate “body” tag
[04:11:55] <Cork> linux_dr: make a fiddle of the problem
[04:12:05] <linux_dr> I was doing $(selector, fakeBody)
[04:14:03] <linux_dr> hmm… my intercept condidion isn’t firing.. that’s the prob… thanks.
[04:17:38] <jotterbot1234> hey guys, can someone recommend a way to animate a text input box fading in below a select dropdown when the "other" option is chosen?
[04:18:27] <jotterbot1234> i can get it to be enabled or disabled depending on "other" being selected, but I want to hide the text input unless the other option is selected
[04:18:53] <Cork> jotterbot1234: why not just do show/hide(300) ?
[04:20:32] <jotterbot1234> Cork: preferably i would do that, I'm just not sure how to go about it? specifically ensuring that the input box smoothly animates on, and pushes the other input fields below it further down
[04:21:07] <Cork> jotterbot1234: on('change
[04:21:10] <Cork> opps
[04:21:38] <jotterbot1234> at the moment i am using:
[04:21:42] <jotterbot1234> if ($(this).val() == 'other'){
[04:21:44] <Cork> jotterbot1234: on('change' ... { $('input').toggle(300, $(this).val() == 'something');
[04:21:53] <jotterbot1234> $("#video_size_other").prop('disabled', false);
[04:22:21] <Cork> ah...
[04:22:27] <Cork> hmm toggle doesn't take the condition
[04:23:01] <jotterbot1234> Cork: i'm a beginner i'm afraid so, I am still learning as I go
[04:23:12] <Cork> jotterbot1234: well ya, just do the animation and do the disabling from the callback
[04:23:59] <jotterbot1234> i thought this would be a very common application of jquery. and yet, though i remember many sites doing this i can't seem to find any at the moment to refrence
[04:24:33] <linux_dr> This is odd… my arguments list is reporting 2 params when there should only be one.
[04:28:29] <seutje> linux_dr: that's not a whole lot to go on
[04:28:57] <linux_dr> Yeh… and not very jquery related either… I’m troubleshooting it now.
[04:32:09] <linux_dr> Hmm… “#textHolder” instanceof String is returning false. :(
[04:33:58] <Cork> linux_dr: the first one looks like an output of a dom element
[04:34:51] <linux_dr> Cork… it’s a selector I’m passing into my mocked jQuery object…
[04:35:21] <Cork> linux_dr: make a jsfiddle of the problem you have
[04:35:28] <Cork> it will make this much simpler to answer
[04:36:27] <seutje> damn, I can't find that south park "got some code" homeless guy parody image
[04:36:49] <linux_dr> I think I have it narrowed down to a small code fragment, but it’s refusing to run on the console… then again, I’m going on way too little sleep.
[04:37:04] <linux_dr> I’ve got: {}.toString.call('#textHolder')
[04:37:20] <linux_dr> doh
[04:37:39] <linux_dr> no… that should work.
[04:39:24] <seutje> why would you wanna do that?
[04:39:49] <seutje> js> print(typeof '#textHolder')
[04:39:54] <b-ot> seutje: string
[04:40:21] <seutje> use the literals and save urself some headaches
[04:40:36] <seutje> primitives*
[04:41:32] <linux_dr> I forgot to mention that ‘#textHolder’ was actually substituted in from a variable…
[04:41:49] <linux_dr> not super elegant, but it works.
[04:41:52] <Cork> doens't change anything
[04:42:30] <linux_dr> I changed (a instanceof String) to ({}.toString.call(a) == "[object String]")
[04:42:44] <Cork> uh string isn't an object
[04:42:57] <Macaveli> I'm disabling my cancel button like this -> $('#cancel_button').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); but he is still clickable how come?
[04:43:10] <Cork> Macaveli: don't use attr for disabled
[04:43:11] <Macaveli> tried the same with prop and still clickbable
[04:43:15] <Cork> use prop true/false
[04:44:49] <linux_dr> ok… (typeof a == "string”).. much cleaner… thanks
[04:46:01] <Macaveli> Cork, is it possible to disable a link with prop?
[04:46:11] <Macaveli> A link that is shaped like a button
[04:46:17] <Cork> Macaveli: no only form elements
[04:46:38] <Cork> well form elements and <link> tags
[04:46:51] <Macaveli> So I will still need to use .attr disabled disabled to disable an <a>
[04:47:05] <Cork> Macaveli: you can't disable a link with disabled
[04:47:08] <seutje> can't disable a link like that though o.O
[04:47:13] <Cork> you need to use js for that
[04:47:32] <Macaveli> I now use ->     $('#cancel_button').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[04:47:32] <Macaveli>     $('#cancel_button').bind 'click' , (e) ->
[04:47:32] <Macaveli>       e.preventDefault();
[04:47:38] <Cork> Macaveli: attr('disabled', 'disabled') does basically the same thing as prop('disabled', true)
[04:47:39] <Macaveli> better paste bin it next
[04:47:46] <Cork> except it doesn't work cross browsers
[04:48:12] <Cork> and the limitation for disabled is that it is ONLY suppose to work for form elements
[04:48:32] <Cork> if you get it to work on other elements you have a bug in that browser
[04:48:40] <Cork> (well except <link>)
[04:53:32] <Macaveli> Cork, I have bind click to e.preventDefault(); how to restore normall click behavior
[04:53:51] <Cork> Macaveli: by not calling preventDefault on click
[04:54:10] <Macaveli> so once set it can't be undone?
[04:54:16] <Cork> Macaveli: simplest is to do something like $('a').data('disabled', true);
[04:54:22] <NotHere> is there a way to run some code when an async loaded js is loaded? For ex. to async load jqueryui.js and run $('.button').button(); when jqueryui is loaded
[04:54:31] <Macaveli> Cork, will try
[04:54:35] <Cork> and in the click handler do if($(this).data('disabled') { e.preventDefault(); }
[04:54:44] <Cork> * if($(this).data('disabled')) { e.preventDefault(); }
[04:55:18] <Cork> NotHere: you would have to attach an onload event handler on the script tag loading jquery
[04:56:48] <NotHere> Cork, I'm not sure I understand. You mean <script async onload="js.." src="jqueryui.js"/>?
[04:57:10] <Cork> NotHere: no not really
[04:57:42] <Cork> but ya, if you call the function from the onload attribute it should work
[04:58:05] <Cork> NotHere: normally when you load script async you do it from js
[04:58:08] <NotHere> Cork, is there another way?
[04:58:25] <Cork> NotHere: either through the attribute or in js with event handler
[04:58:31] <Cork> no other way if you have to make it async
[04:58:45] <Cork> (question is why you need to through)
[04:59:06] <NotHere> (for speed of rendering)
[04:59:27] <Cork> you don't need to make it async to do that
[04:59:59] <Cork> move the scripts to the end of the body so it doesn't block the initial rendering and you should get the speed your looking for
[05:00:11] <Cork> without the need to handle scripts loading in any order they like
[05:00:46] <NotHere> I think you are right...
[05:03:34] <NotHere> thanks
[05:10:55] <Bernardao> hey, finally got it working with $.getJSON
[05:20:32] <Ruddy> Hi, there Ben
[05:20:48] <Macaveli> Cork, thanks a lot for your if statement
[05:20:54] <Macaveli> workalike a charm
[05:21:21] <Cork> Macaveli: anoter option is to bind and unbind the event handler
[05:21:37] <Guest17630> Quick query, i came across your slit slider , quite nifty and impressive. Now the problem i have is using custom icons
[05:21:52] <Cork> Macaveli: but that is normally a much worse choice cause it makes the code messier, and adding and removing event listener is a bit risky
[05:22:08] <Cork> Macaveli: btw make sure to make the event listener delegated
[05:22:25] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector', func)
[05:22:33] <Macaveli> did it like that :)
[05:22:37] <Cork> good
[05:22:46] <Macaveli>   $("#cancel_button").on 'click', (e) ->
[05:22:46] <Macaveli>     e.preventDefault()  if $(this).data("disabled")
[05:22:55] <Cork> no that isn't delegated
[05:23:09] <Cork> but on the other hand, your doing it on a single element
[05:23:33] <Cork> the delegate idea only makes sense if you have multiple links you want to match
[05:28:01] <axilla> morning all, I am adding a feature to my site where a user can save a custom folder image.. the folder image div is either 600x600 or 200x200 depending on the view they're looking at.  I want to allow the user to be able to position the folder image within those boundries and save its location for future rendering.  I plan to use jquery dragable and jquery position for the x,y, and saving of location.. what can I use for zooming on the Z-
[05:32:52] <Lurzino> hello everyone
[05:39:22] <Lurzino> I am trying to implement a custom event post-it widget using a .clone() of a hidden div but also the widget would be hidden... so shall I have to use toggleClass() and change class to cloned div?
[05:45:55] <Cork> Lurzino: to do what?
[05:46:21] <Lurzino> to show the widget in the sidebar
[05:46:44] <Lurzino> because the div template is hidden
[05:47:12] <Cork> Lurzino: hide the "template" by the existence of the parent
[05:47:28] <Cork> when you clone it and append it to its target it would just be visible as expected
[05:49:04] <Lurzino> Cork you mean just like change css with toggleClass when showing in the sidebar ?
[05:49:04] <gingitzune> Hey, I must be missing osmething basic. What do i have to do to get the input value?
[05:49:07] <gingitzune> http://pastebin.com/cFKmANJp
[05:49:26] <gingitzune> The value is changed via .val() and the change event is triggered manually
[05:49:39] <Cork> Lurzino: no, just have the hiding be dependent on the parent
[05:51:52] <Cork> Lurzino: http://jsfiddle.net/468SN/1/
[05:52:49] <decx> put templates in a script tag
[05:53:18] <Cork> decx: it gets kept as a string if you do though
[05:55:13] <Lurzino> Cork ah with <aside> tag would automatically show the template div?
[05:55:36] <Cork> Lurzino: no it is more that anything inside #template is specifically hidden
[05:55:39] <Cork> (check the css section)
[05:55:50] <Lurzino> aaahhhhh
[05:55:56] <Lurzino> didn't see the *
[05:56:15] <Cork> Lurzino: you could just do #template { display: none; } though
[05:56:27] <Cork> would be a faster selector and give the same result
[05:58:07] <brunoais> I'd actually use the <template> HTML tag
[05:58:21] <brunoais> for backwards compatibility, I'd make the CSS rule:
[05:58:31] <Cork> brunoais: true
[05:58:32] <brunoais> template{display: none;}
[05:58:38] <brunoais> just for the older guys
[05:58:42] <Cork> brunoais: it is a bit irky in older ie though
[05:59:00] <Cork> document.createElement('template'); :)
[05:59:08] <brunoais> Hum...
[05:59:14] <brunoais> I wouldn't create them dynamically, though
[05:59:17] <Lurzino> hmmm I'll try that <template> tag then
[05:59:19] <Cork> brunoais: you have to
[05:59:25] <brunoais> ?
[05:59:37] <brunoais> It'd just output it directly when the request is made
[05:59:40] <Cork> brunoais: you have to dynamically create an element in ie7 (i think it was) or it won't allow you to style the tag
[06:00:06] <brunoais> won't let styling with CSS?
[06:00:17] <Cork> so you in head have <script>document.createElement('main');document.createElement('aside');document.createElement('template');document.createElement('header');...</script>
[06:00:27] <Cork> brunoais: not when it doesn't know about the tag
[06:00:42] <brunoais> Hum... shiv?
[06:00:49] <brunoais> or not an option?
[06:01:11] <Cork> i think that is what shiv does
[06:01:24] <Cork> typ
[06:01:28] <Cork> "This includes the basic createElement() shiv technique, along with monkeypatches for document.createElement and document.createDocumentFragment for IE6-8."
[06:02:00] <Cork> so ya everything pre ie8 needs it
[06:02:08] <Cork> uh
[06:02:11] <Cork> *pre ie9
[06:06:37] <MikeD_> anyone here use the tooltip plugin http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[06:14:37] <z3l> Lets say I have many <div class="parent"><div class="a">a</div><div class="b"></div></div>. I am selecting class="a" with jQuery and from this, how can I select the b class which is in the same node ?
[06:15:13] <MikeD_> .paernt().find('.b')  ?
[06:15:16] <MikeD_> parent
[06:15:25] <z3l> mhm, thank you.
[06:15:31] <decx> siblings('.b')
[06:16:13] <MikeD_> of course there's a convenience function for parent().children()  :)
[06:16:54] <decx> it's even better as it includes a filter, so the original element isnt in the sibling collection
[06:17:37] <MikeD_> cool
[06:26:01] <z3l> :)
[06:31:09] <erming> Okay, help guys!
[06:31:46] <erming> i got 2 events listening on an <input>, x and y
[06:32:29] <erming> i want to stop events from x, so that y doesnt happens, BUT: i still want the default behaviour on this <input> to happen
[06:32:51] <Cork> ?mdn stopImidiatePropagation
[06:32:52] <b-ot> Cork: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org stopImidiatePropagation”.
[06:32:54] <erming> e.preventDefault(), e.stopPropagation() or return false doesnt work.
[06:33:02] <erming> Cork that didn't work either
[06:33:13] <MikeD_> immediate
[06:33:21] <Cork> ?mdn stopImmediatePropagation
[06:33:22] <b-ot> Cork: event.stopImmediatePropagation - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.stopImmediatePropagation
[06:33:55] <erming> that kills the default from happening too
[06:34:23] <MikeD_> is there a doDefault() ?
[06:34:36] <Cork> erming: then you have to check if the second event handler should fire
[06:34:48] <Cork> erming: you shouldn't have one event handler controlling another
[06:35:04] <Cork> it can be racy (depending on when you attache the event handler)
[06:35:08] <erming> Cork, true
[06:35:16] <MikeD_> haha "racy"
[06:35:22] <erming> i could solve it that way, but i'm looking for a smarter way to just stop bubbling to another jQuery-event
[06:35:36] <Cork> erming: you can't
[06:35:50] <MikeD_> a smarter way to manage a problem that shouldn't even exist?  that'd be fix the problem instead of work around it.
[06:35:52] <Cork> also you would still fire delegated event listeners for that element
[06:36:07] <Cork> MikeD_++
[06:36:47] <MikeD_> fwiw, i'm not trying to be a dick.. it's just a harsh reality that you'll regret the workaround eventually :)
[06:36:54] <erming> basically
[06:36:57] <erming> i have to events to listen for
[06:37:01] <erming> "keydown" and "input"
[06:37:05] <erming> keydown always fire before input
[06:37:17] <Cork> erming: why do you need to listen for both?
[06:37:23] <Cork> silent keys?
[06:37:24] <erming> input doesnt trigger on tab
[06:37:28] <erming> for example
[06:37:29] * Cork nods
[06:37:41] <erming> but i need to stop "input" from happening when i press backspace
[06:37:53] <erming> i couldnt find e.which / e.keyCode inside the input event
[06:37:59] <erming> that would also solve my problem
[06:38:03] <Cork> erming: hmm
[06:38:13] <erming> that is: i want to know if "backspace" was pressed, inside the "input" event
[06:38:16] <Cork> erming: input fires after the text has been added
[06:38:21] <Cork> so ya, that makes sense
[06:38:23] <erming> it fires when removed too
[06:38:39] <erming> but there's nothing inside the event-object to see if that was actually a backspace
[06:39:24] <erming> but i think i'll go with a boolean
[06:40:09] <erming> inside keydown: "if (isBackspace) backspace = true" and inside "input": "if (isBackspace) { isBackspace = false; return; }"
[06:40:21] <erming> i'll show you guys the result soon :> you might wonder wtf i'm working on
[06:40:30] <Cork> erming: why not just check if which == 0?
[06:40:33] <Cork> (in input)
[06:40:33] <MikeD_> erming: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353550/how-to-capture-a-backspace-on-the-onkeydown-event
[06:40:42] <Cork> shouldn't that be good enough?
[06:41:29] <Cork> ugg
[06:41:33] <Cork> which is always 0 >_>
[06:42:11] <erming> yeah, the event-object for input doesnt seem to contain much
[06:42:47] <Cork> ya, that is kinda silly honestly...
[06:42:52] <Cork> never looked before
[06:43:44] <Cork> erming: how about doing something like (function() { var key; $('').on('keydown', func).on('input', func); })(); ?
[06:45:08] <Cork> erming: http://jsfiddle.net/y8GZ5/
[06:45:40] <erming> ah, Cork, that could also work
[06:46:00] <erming> right now i'm just setting a boolean.. backspace = true
[06:46:15] <erming> in "input", i set backspace = false, but cancel the rest of the event if it was true
[06:46:17] <Cork> erming: the point is the scoping
[06:46:21] <erming> kinda the same thing
[06:46:27] <Cork> what value you store doesn't really matter
[07:09:21] <uskerine> hi, does anyonw know how to hide the "show row numbers" select in datatables so all rows are displayed?
[07:11:44] <seutje> uskerine: http://www.datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/length_menu.html
[07:12:24] <uskerine> what i would like is to hide it
[07:12:29] <uskerine> not to change it or add the All option
[07:12:53] <uskerine> I already make it All the option by default, but I can't find how to hide the select
[07:14:15] <MikeD_> i've spent 2 hours looking for why the tooltip didn't display... turns out there's an additional stylesheet that makes the tooltip position: absolute (it's been clipped behind everything)  *sigh*
[07:14:18] <seutje> well, u can set paging to false or iDisplayLength to -1
[07:14:52] <uskerine> how do i set paging to false seutje? I think that's what I am looking for
[07:15:01] <seutje> 'paging': false
[07:15:42] <uskerine> great
[07:15:43] <uskerine> thanks!
[07:15:54] <seutje> http://datatables.net/reference/option/paging\
[07:16:04] <uskerine> yeah, i tried and it works fine
[07:16:06] <uskerine> :)
[07:18:08] <z3l> hm, lets say my this object is currently input. It contains some custom attribute, is there any way to access it?
[07:18:15] <z3l> cause if taht was value, I could use val()
[07:20:02] <z3l> $(this).attr
[07:20:47] <seutje> z3l: yeah, attr should work for that
[07:22:00] <z3l> I am wondering which mouse event should I use when I am not focusing the input anymore
[07:22:47] <sadtaco> General JS question. http://pastebin.com/qnZrDkgw How can I write lines 1-5 like line 7, but working?  Line7 fails from objs[key] being undefined, and throws an error instead of doing the ||.
[07:23:01] <uskerine> can i make a single datatables column editable? (my rows are recovered via ajax and .row.add, but I would like to add a QUANTITY cell and a TOTAL cell that performs the total)
[07:23:44] <sadtaco> Yes
[07:25:01] <uskerine> sadtaco is that yes for the datatables question? :) if so, could you please point me in the right direction? :)
[07:25:40] <sadtaco> You're talking about a third party plugin.
[07:25:49] <sadtaco> Hopefully it has callbacks in its api. Otherwise, you edit its source.
[07:26:11] <sadtaco> and add contenteditable="true" prop to what you want editable.
[07:26:15] <skullcrasher> i have a problem with my plugin. http://jsfiddle.net/6R6NG/
[07:26:15] <sadtaco> Or make it an input.
[07:26:28] <skullcrasher> i always get an uncaught error in console, but why???
[07:26:38] <uskerine> i see
[07:26:55] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: Do you want to be extending an object?
[07:27:40] <sadtaco> Bill, will it be better performance than those 5 lines?
[07:28:05] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: I'm still not positive exactly what you're going for. What do you want to end up with?
[07:28:09] <sadtaco> But I am curious about that. I can't quite fathom how I'd extend an object to make that work well.
[07:28:16] <sadtaco> BillCriswell, the key is in one of two objects.
[07:28:21] <sadtaco> If it's not in the first, it's in the second.
[07:30:06] <sadtaco> Rather
[07:30:10] <sadtaco> The first hash may not exist
[07:30:21] <sadtaco> In which case it checks in another list of hashes
[07:30:58] <BillCriswell> It sounds like you might want ternary?
[07:31:16] <BillCriswell> var hash = something[foo] ? something[foo] : other[foo]; ?
[07:32:02] <sadtaco> Oh yeah. That's another way to do it. Drops it down to 2 lines
[07:32:35] <BillCriswell> That's two lines?
[07:32:40] <BillCriswell> Not that lines matter, but still.
[07:34:25] <Cork> sadtaco: fn.params[key] = (objs[prop.type+'s'] || objs.customs[prop.type])[prop.val]; should work
[07:34:44] <sadtaco> Yes, Bill. That's to select the hash, then another to get it.
[07:34:50] <sadtaco> Cork, that's what I was looking for I think!
[07:35:15] <sadtaco> I like to avoid setting vars because of the garbage collector and such
[07:35:37] <Cork> sadtaco: you don't create any garbage in this case
[07:35:43] <Cork> as your using a reference to the old object
[07:35:48] <sadtaco> I know
[07:35:51] <sadtaco> I mean the other case
[07:35:53] <Cork> so the jit will optimize it away
[07:35:55] <sadtaco> Setting a has variable
[07:36:00] <Cork> sadtaco: i meant the original code
[07:36:34] <sadtaco> "var hash = objs[prop.type+'s'] ? objs[prop.type+'s'] : objs.customs[prop.type];  fn.params[key] = hash[prop.val];" isn't either? Doesn't the "hash" var need deleting by the GC?
[07:36:52] <axilla> hi all, i have a modal window I want to make an image inside of that modal window dragable from.
[07:37:10] <axilla> but it doesn't appear that my jquery code works in the modal?
[07:37:10] <Cork> sadtaco: well you will create memory for the pointer to the object
[07:37:19] <axilla> it does work outside of the modal though
[07:37:21] <Cork> sadtaco: but that shouldn't matter the nursery should handle that
[07:37:35] <sadtaco> Yeah.
[07:37:50] <sadtaco> It's still avoidable overhead on something happening potentially thousands of times a second.
[07:37:52] <Cork> sadtaco: and in some case like i said the jit will optimize away the extra variable completely
[07:38:20] <sadtaco> Yeah, possible. It's hard to know what the VM does.
[07:38:29] <sadtaco> I should run a jsperf on both those ways
[07:38:30] <Cork> sadtaco: well cross scope access is more costly then a single variable gc
[07:38:51] <BillCriswell> Just how thin are the hairs we're splitting here?
[07:38:52] <Cork> if you put the variable to be function global it only does gc once too
[07:39:02] <Cork> BillCriswell: heh atoms :D
[07:39:22] <sadtaco> There is cross scope access both ways, no?
[07:39:39] <Cork> sadtaco: if you have a variable in say global scope
[07:40:05] <Cork> and a call in a loop switches to that scope to access the data
[07:40:13] <Cork> it is more costly then setting it in the function
[07:40:28] <sadtaco> As in passing a param? Interesting to know. I'll need to test that out too.
[07:40:31] <Cork> sadtaco: but we are talking about performance critical code paths before this matters
[07:41:22] <Cork> window.global_variable = { data: true } (function() { for(...) { global_variable.data ... } })()
[07:41:37] <Cork> compared to
[07:41:39] <sadtaco> That's what I'm dealing with here.
[07:41:46] <brunoais> It depends on how many scopes it runs in
[07:41:59] <sadtaco> It's an MMO server written in node.js.
[07:42:04] <Cork> window.global_variable = { data: true } (function() { var local = global_variable; for(...) { local.data ... } })()
[07:42:29] <Cork> sadtaco: but this is getting down to analyzing how the jit engine works
[07:42:30] <brunoais> Firefox's JIT compiler finds variables that are used multiple times and then copys them to the scope it is used multiple times
[07:42:46] <sadtaco> Indeed.
[07:42:49] <brunoais> then it writes back to the scope it was before when the function exists
[07:42:51] <sadtaco> It requires benchmarking on the VM
[07:42:51] <brunoais> *exits
[07:42:57] <Cork> ya
[07:43:22] <Cork> brunoais: it wasn't the case if you go back a little while
[07:43:26] <brunoais> I think v8 does the same
[07:43:28] <Cork> i remember the bug about it
[07:43:40] <brunoais> yeah, before it was following the whole stack
[07:44:14] <Cork> currently the biggest problem in ff is the scope inheriting keeping everything alive
[07:44:14] <brunoais> Cork, do you know if v8 does the same?
[07:44:15] <sadtaco> v8 does a lot of addon optimisations to code. Like if you do a for loop that references an array length
[07:44:19] <sadtaco> It sets a variable for its length
[07:44:27] <sadtaco> But if your for loop changes the array length, it doesn't.
[07:44:34] <Cork> brunoais: it does
[07:44:43] <Cork> brunoais: v8 is aggressive in these areas
[07:44:59] <sadtaco> v8 is generally far faster on all the logic things.
[07:45:06] <sadtaco> I don't know about DOM stuff.
[07:45:07] <brunoais> it depends
[07:45:10] <Cork> sadtaco: that isn't true actually
[07:45:26] <brunoais> spidermonkey and v8 do not control the DOM manipulation
[07:45:28] <Cork> what engine is faster depends on what area you care about
[07:45:39] <sadtaco> Well I jsperf in chrome and FF all the time, and generally my fastest option is fastest on FF, even if a few options are better on FF.
[07:45:44] <brunoais> I agree with cork there
[07:46:08] <brunoais> sadtaco, v8 does optimizations that many jsperf tests fail to explore
[07:46:10] <Cork> sadtaco: for example there is a guy i talk with quite often that pulls his hare over the slow performance in v8
[07:46:17] <brunoais> they are not made in spidermonkey
[07:46:20] <sadtaco> Yeah. But Chrome is close.
[07:46:29] <Cork> opps missed to say a gameboy color emulator developer
[07:46:32] <brunoais> because it does not make as much sense (sometimes it does, though)
[07:47:01] <brunoais> Actually, the slowness can be cause by v8 trying to opimize :D
[07:47:04] <brunoais> *optimize
[07:47:11] <brunoais> but that's just me speculating
[07:47:26] <Cork> brunoais: no he has specific bugs cause of missing optimizations
[07:47:34] <Cork> i think most of them are on the way to be fixed though
[07:47:40] <brunoais> ah, ok
[07:48:36] <Cork> when he wrote his gameboy (not color) emulator he had serious problem with chromes typedarray beeing dead slow
[07:49:00] <Cork> he had to move chrome to use normal arrays for a while cause of it :)
[07:49:21] <Cork> now google uses the emulator as one of there perf tests ^^
[07:49:55] <brunoais> Oh
[07:49:57] <brunoais> awsome
[07:50:08] <brunoais> It's the fight for the JIT speed :D
[07:50:09] <Cork> ya, it is kinda cool talking with him
[07:50:27] <brunoais> v8 vs spidermonkey!
[07:50:40] <brunoais> who's best... Depends on the objective
[07:50:44] <Cork> specially as he has a bytecode parser written for the gb platform :)
[07:51:16] <brunoais> Actually, I think there's no js compiler and executer than spidermonkey and v8. If there is, I never heard of it
[07:51:29] <Cork> but for a long time the dom in ff is draggin the js engine and actually rendering engine down
[07:51:51] <Cork> they are working on getting that one better, and they are slowly getting there
[07:51:54] <BillCriswell> You nerds.
[07:52:11] <BillCriswell> That's short for "I have no idea what you people are talking about."
[07:52:20] <Cork> brunoais: you have operas, ies and safaries ones
[07:52:27] <Cork> so ya there are plenty of other
[07:52:42] <Cork> well *had* operas :)
[07:52:48] <Cork> that engine is dead now
[07:52:54] <brunoais> Ups
[07:52:56] <brunoais> I miswrote that
[07:53:06] <brunoais> it should have been
[07:53:20] <brunoais> "Actually, I think there's no faster js compiler and executer than spidermonkey and v8. If there is, I never heard of it"
[07:53:26] <brunoais> the word "compiler" was missing
[07:53:33] <Cork> ah
[07:53:40] <Cork> well ie is trying to catch up
[07:53:47] <brunoais> true
[07:53:55] <Cork> nitro is left in the dust though
[07:53:59] <Cork> (safarie)
[07:54:02] <Cork> -e
[07:54:12] <brunoais> I suffer from thinking faster than I type. Sometimes, for longer sentences I start skipping words :D
[07:54:32] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Hahaha. Same.
[07:54:35] <Cork> oh right
[07:54:43] <BillCriswell> Same with talking.
[07:54:45] <Cork> i forgot there is rhino for java
[07:54:49] <Cork> not sure how it competes
[07:54:50] <drej> brunoais i have the opposite problem, i often type faster than i think
[07:54:51] <brunoais> yeh
[07:54:55] <drej> then have to stop and be "wtf am i typing?"
[07:54:59] <brunoais> :D
[07:55:15] <Cork> drej: lol
[07:56:27] <axilla> does anyone know of a good jquery plugin that will allow me to drag an image around a confined space and set its xyz positions without adjusting the size of the image(no cropping, i want to save the positions in my database.)
[07:56:47] <BillCriswell> It's a lot more embarrassing when you're talking. There's times I'll be talking, realized I totally forgot a really important part of something then just sit there like an idiot.
[07:57:17] <Cork> BillCriswell: lol been there
[07:57:24] <axilla> meh, everyones been there.
[07:57:28] <axilla> weekly shit
[07:57:40] <axilla> i spun my wheels for hours on a problem the other day
[07:57:41] <Cork> the mind is start drifting off for a different thought and *uhh.. what was i talking about?* :D
[07:57:56] <drej> BillCriswell my girlfriend does that ALL THE TIME
[07:58:10] <drej> she'll like say a bunch of shit, but like a third of the way down her thought process
[07:58:24] <drej> so she'll think about it, have a theme and whtaever in her head, then just start talking half way through the thought
[07:58:27] <drej> like i know wtf she's talking about
[07:58:48] <drej> there have been conversations that start with literally 10 minutes of silence then "so i should really just take the blue one, right?"
[07:58:51] <sacho> your fault
[07:58:55] <drej> sacho totes
[07:58:59] <BillCriswell> drej: My Mom is like that. She'll start using pronouns before telling me who she's talking about.
[07:59:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah it's tough. I am pretty sure I bombed an interview cause of it lol
[07:59:28] <sacho> I've told my gf I don't respond to queries that include pronouns.
[07:59:28] <BillCriswell> I just saw in the guys face like "What the fuck is he talking about?"
[07:59:48] <sacho> I get enough variable shadowing in my work :)
[08:00:00] <BillCriswell> sacho: Haha. I should try it.
[08:00:23] <drej> my brother does it too, but he does it differently where he says like every 3rd word of the sentece he composes in his head
[08:01:29] <sacho> it's a puzzle!
[08:01:52] <sacho> I wonder if this situation comes from people learning to type faster than they talk.
[08:03:42] <BillCriswell> sacho: Typing is so much easier than talking. I can complete a thought, go through it again, make sure it's all right, then send it. With talking it's like one shot then you're done.
[08:04:21] <drej> pshh, so you're that one person on the internet that reads things before hitting enter?
[08:04:22] <drej> nice to meet you
[08:04:38] <brunoais> I read... most of the times.
[08:04:48] <BillCriswell> Haha. It doesn't always work... but it beats talking.
[08:04:55] <brunoais> Sometimes I just want to get something out there as fast as possible and I forget to check it.
[08:05:03] <brunoais> Talking is hard
[08:05:09] <brunoais> pronunciation is required
[08:05:12] <sacho> BillCriswell, definitely. Plus, talking tends to block the recipient. So inefficient!
[08:05:16] <BillCriswell> When speaking you're like... expected to reply right away, on a text or an email you have all the time you want.
[08:05:20] <BillCriswell> sacho: Yes.
[08:05:21] <sacho> I prefer async communication :)
[08:06:28] <BillCriswell> sacho: Ageed... though it gets messy sometimes.
[08:06:45] <drej> with the spittle and such
[08:06:49] <sacho> I wonder if there'll be a social revolution to phase out talking
[08:06:54] <BillCriswell> When one person is going a message a second and the other person is trying to respond to the third one down.
[08:07:10] <BillCriswell> sacho: I think it would be a biological thing.
[08:07:18] <sacho> I mean, if you everyone has a device in their hand, as long as there's an adequate input method, you could input a message and 'send' it to another
[08:07:18] <skullcrasher> how do i have to trigger the 'afterInit' event, so I don't get that error?
[08:07:19] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't be shocked if we were heading that way now.
[08:07:19] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/6R6NG/1/
[08:07:25] <sacho> -you
[08:07:59] <sacho> you'd still have 'broadcast', but it would be blockable, you'd get search and history...man
[08:08:13] <skullcrasher> I figured out that jquery switches to the handler function when calling the trigger, but it seems like the object is not finished initalizing
[08:08:19] <skullcrasher> or is there another mistake?
[08:08:32] <BillCriswell> There's a lot of evolutionary advantages to typing I'd imagine.
[08:08:47] <antlong> whats the term for an animation that slides down from the top of the page, like visor for mac does via hotkey?
[08:09:09] <sacho> that's a lot of code, man
[08:09:19] <BillCriswell> antlong: I'd call it a "slide in from the top" I guess.
[08:09:27] <antlong> thanks BillCriswell
[08:10:07] <BillCriswell> antlong: Drop In? I dunno.
[08:10:14] <BillCriswell> There has to be a glossary for this shit somewhere.
[08:10:26] <abhinavmehta_> I’ve full and valid html page as string in Javascript.. now I want to run some selector.. how can I do that? (example makes it clear: https://dpaste.de/i8mc)
[08:10:40] <antlong> maybe a slide down?
[08:11:06] <BillCriswell> antlong: Yeah, that works as well.
[08:12:30] <abhinavmehta_> I’m newbie to jQuery.. and just need to make this line to work.. so please pardon if asking something very naive (repasting url for ref: https://dpaste.de/i8mc)
[08:13:30] <BillCriswell> abhinavmehta_: I think you want $(d).find('.xyz')
[08:13:48] <abhinavmehta_> BillCriswell: ok.. giving a try
[08:14:06] <sadtaco> Cork, oh yeah typed things in Firefox are faster.
[08:14:33] <puchacz> hi, who knows rangy library?
[08:14:51] <puchacz> I would like to "reset" it
[08:15:31] <puchacz> I had user selected something, then reloaded a document fragment with ajax that contained the selection
[08:15:35] <puchacz> so it is not valid anymore
[08:15:47] <abhinavmehta_> BillCriswell: yeah, it works.
[08:15:53] <abhinavmehta_> BillCriswell: thank you! :)
[08:16:06] <BillCriswell> abhinavmehta_: No problem
[08:16:11] <puchacz> unfortunately rangy.getIframeSelection($("#browserIframe")[0]).rangeCount; still shows 1
[08:16:19] <puchacz> i.e. it has selection in it, just not valid
[08:19:04] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I am trying to understand the ajax.done callback and I have a simple question: will the code inside the 'done' callback only execute once the response from the server has returned with a 2** response code?  The reason I ask is because I am trying to return data from inside the callback and I think I am running into an issue where the callback returns before the response has arrived.
[08:19:43] <systemfault> louism2wash: Right, on 4xx or 5xx, .fail will be called instead of .done
[08:21:10] <louism2wash> systemFault: cool, thanks.  I think I need to research ways to return data from inside the callback more but this is a step in the right direction.
[08:22:23] <sacho> louism2wash, what's your problem there?
[08:23:52] <louism2wash> sacho: I'm trying to test my js so I want to isolate my method return values rather than operate on the dom directly from the callback
[08:25:35] <sacho> you can use .then() and return a new promise for the data specifically
[08:26:16] <sacho> at some point you'd need to handle the data in a callback though - that's the nature of promises
[08:26:39] <louism2wash> sacho: yeah, that or make the call synchronous which defeats the purpose
[08:26:49] <louism2wash> sacho: I appreciate the advice
[08:27:20] <sacho> but you could have something like var dataPromise = $.ajax().then(function success() { //do stuff; return data; }); then pass the dataPromise around
[08:27:52] <sacho> or just $.ajax and pass that
[08:28:01] <systemfault> louism2wash: If you don’t want your non-DOM related code to rely on jQuery, get a real promise library like bluebird or q
[08:28:44] <louism2wash> systemfault: what is the benefit of those over using what is built into jquery?  For what I am trying to do does it sounds like jquery is sufficient?
[08:30:27] <systemfault> louism2wash: They’re WAY more powerful and they actually follow the spec. Also, I don’t know what you’re trying to do.
[08:30:43] <systemfault> Just saying that the jQuery promise implementation is a bad joke.
[08:32:09] <Jon47> systemfault: wow.
[08:33:23] <systemfault> Jon47: The Promise ctor + Promise.all + Promise#spread + Promise.props + better error handling… it’s lightyears ahead of what jQuery provides.
[08:33:57] <Jon47> I'm sure there are better implemtnations but jQuery's implemtnation is fine
[08:34:08] <systemfault> No, that’s the issue, it’s broken.
[08:34:20] <Jon47> i'm not even gonna look this up but it was probably written before the spec was standardized
[08:34:26] <Jon47> promises is broken, is ajax is broken?
[08:34:46] <systemfault> Jon47: Broken means “non-standard conformant”
[08:34:47] <Jon47> *or ajax
[08:35:04] <sacho> Promise#spread?
[08:35:25] <sacho> ahh ok
[08:36:34] <sacho> I think .when() is analogous to .all
[08:36:38] <systemfault> sacho: Yeah, let’s say you use Promise.all([p1, p2, p2]), instead of having to do .then(function(result) { var p1result = result[0],etc…}) you can do .spread(function(p1Result, p2Result, p3Result){})
[08:36:40] <sacho> I like q though
[08:36:49] <systemfault> Yeah, Q is totally fine.
[08:37:11] <sacho> Actually I haven't had to use jquery since angular
[08:37:15] <systemfault> I personally switched to bluebird because I think that the error messages are clearer (It’s also a lot faster)
[08:37:34] <systemfault> sacho: I’m trying to switch our codebase at work from angular to reactjs
[08:38:05] <sacho> I read about reactjs but I've had a poor year on javascript codingin general so I'm playing catch-up to the new libs
[08:38:31] <systemfault> sacho: So are you using the jQuery-lite version of angular or you still include jQuery along with angularÉ
[08:38:33] <systemfault> ?
[08:38:53] <sacho> I include jquery but only for the benefit of my designers, because they like the animations and shit
[08:39:00] <sacho> I haven't actually used jquery at all
[08:39:17] <sacho> although it does sometime lead to some stupid bindings :P
[08:39:22] <deanclkclk> hello folks
[08:39:32] <deanclkclk> where's the link for me to build my own jquery theme?
[08:40:02] <systemfault> Just google for: jQuery UI theme builder      or something similar
[08:41:04] <skullcrasher> how do i trigger a custom event the right way?
[08:41:24] <systemfault> skullcrasher: Using .trigger
[08:41:32] <skullcrasher> well yes i read about this
[08:41:55] <skullcrasher> my problem is that i have a plugin and on the end of its init function i want a trigger "afterInit"
[08:42:26] <skullcrasher> i used $(this.element).trigger('afterInit')
[08:42:43] <skullcrasher> but always get an error if i bind a function of this plugin to this event
[08:43:02] <systemfault> skullcrasher: How do you bind itÉ
[08:43:05] <systemfault> ?
[08:43:29] <skullcrasher> with $('element').on('afterInit',function() ....
[08:43:53] <systemfault> Should work just fine.
[08:44:16] <skullcrasher> hmmm
[08:45:15] <skullcrasher> i paste a fiddle
[08:45:18] <skullcrasher> there are 2 problems
[08:45:24] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/6R6NG/2/
[08:45:40] <skullcrasher> if i initialize my plugin first and then add the eventhandler it never gets to the event
[08:46:50] <skullcrasher> $('div#3dd').mediaselect(options);
[08:46:56] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/6R6NG/3/
[08:47:07] <disappearedng> Hey I am trying to dump an object's key and values to html to be displayed on a div. https://gist.github.com/vicngtor/a033681b1ad9d6b76b0b Can someone recommend me an easier way of doing this?
[08:47:12] <disappearedng> Cause this doesn't really work
[08:47:32] <antlong> if anyone is interested in open source game projects: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/274abd/multiverse_miner_an_opensource_reddit_created/
[08:48:56] <skullcrasher> systemfault: and if i initialize the plugin after the eventhandler, i get an error
[08:49:50] <systemfault> Err, stupid jsfiddle, where do you do .trigger(....)
[08:50:03] <skullcrasher> in MediaSelect.prototyp init
[08:50:16] <skullcrasher> it has comments before after :)
[08:50:39] <skullcrasher> line 112
[08:51:22] <skullcrasher> the error occurs then in line 157
[08:51:36] <skullcrasher> as it says the function is not there (but it is)
[08:51:45] <skullcrasher> i think the plugin is not finished initalizing
[08:51:54] <systemfault> So the trigger works fine.
[08:52:47] <skullcrasher> only if set before initializing the plugin, but then the error in line 157 occurs
[08:53:15] <skullcrasher> it says the method 'updatePlaceholder' is not defined, but it is
[08:53:46] <skullcrasher> and if i put lin 157 in an setTimeout with 0ms it works
[08:54:04] <skullcrasher> but without it won't
[08:54:18] <skullcrasher> I just don't understand why
[08:55:09] <skullcrasher> is the order of call functions wrong??
[08:55:18] <skullcrasher> *called
[08:55:33] <systemfault> Hmm, let me check something… that would be retarded if .trigger is synchronous
[08:55:45] <skullcrasher> my theory is, exactly that
[08:56:06] <skullcrasher> it triggers, then jumps to the handler but the plugin is not yet initialized and therefore it throws an error
[08:57:14] <skullcrasher> sry, brb 5 mins
[08:58:06] <damasceno> Hello, I'm using JQuery Mobile table and I'm having a problem with the "Columns" button. It doesn't work. This is my code (Headers and table): http://pastebin.com/k5c5R6Y1 Does anyone know why? :S
[09:00:52] <systemfault> skullcrasher: Seems to be the case, trigger seems to be sync… The proper think to do would probably to add a setTimeout(function() { triggertheinitevent }, 0)
[09:03:22] <skullcrasher> :/
[09:03:33] <skullcrasher> damn
[09:03:53] <skullcrasher> so is this really a proper way?
[09:04:37] <systemfault> Add the setTimeout in .init
[09:04:55] <skullcrasher> hmm ok
[09:06:19] <skullcrasher> so whenever i need an asyncronous event i wrap it in timeout 0
[09:11:59] <skullcrasher> works
[09:18:12] <erming> Cork: if you're interested, I was working on this: http://erming.github.io/tabcomplete/
[09:18:57] <erming> and the issue with backspace is not solved
[09:19:00] <erming> now*
[09:19:33] <disappearedng> I need recommendations for URL design: I have a view, a.com/list_entries and now I would like to add a date to the url. I was thinking of doing a.com/list_entries/DD/MM/YYYY so that if I want to go forward I can just redirect to a.com/list_entries/DD+1/MM/YYYY. Any criticisms?
[09:20:40] <z3l> what if you do DD/MM only
[09:21:09] <erming> i'd do it the other way around (european-style): /YYYY/MM/DD
[09:21:10] <erming> ;)
[09:21:22] <z3l> . / suggests some kind of a directory to me. Personally I would do: /list_entries/DD-MM-YYYY
[09:21:54] <erming> Wordpress uses /YYYY/MM/DD too
[09:22:00] <skullcrasher> systemfault: btw, where did you look up if trigger was syncronous?
[09:22:15] <skullcrasher> couldn't find something in the api documentation
[09:22:28] <systemfault> skullcrasher: I looked at the code… and google (Saw on thread on SO)
[09:22:38] <skullcrasher> ah ok :P
[09:27:14] <BillCriswell> This fucking form really makes me want to punch something.
[09:28:05] <tw2113> between BillCriswell's comment and skullcrasher, i can't help but think of a tv show last night
[09:28:15] <BillCriswell> What was it?
[09:28:41] <tw2113> Game of Thrones
[09:29:24] <erming> skulls are being crushed?
[09:29:25] <erming> :D
[09:29:29] <BillCriswell> Never watched that.
[09:29:44] <erming> going to watch that episode tonight
[09:30:15] <tw2113> erming, i won't spoil anything, but i will remind you it's the Trial by Combat episode
[09:30:16] <BillCriswell> I need to catch up on Silicon Valley. That show is so hit or miss for me, though.
[09:30:34] <erming> BillCriswell: if you like nudity and lots of death/blood/limbs being cut off
[09:30:36] <erming> watch it
[09:31:15] <tw2113> sounds like Silicon Valley to me erming
[09:31:19] <BillCriswell> I'm into that stuff.
[09:31:28] <tw2113> oh you meant Got
[09:33:27] <BillCriswell> It's amazing what some HTML can do to your mood.
[09:42:39] <maxmoore14> best practice question: http://jsbin.com/gacagene/1/edit
[09:44:06] <maxmoore14> assume a large number of pages, better performance to have one event and use my own switch, or better to have multiple event handlers?
[09:46:26] <jorvis> When you attach a listener to a lot of features of elements of the same type, how do you access that element when the function is fired?  Here's my shortened code:  http://pastie.org/9250706
[09:47:01] <erming> jorvis: inside your callback you access the variable "this"
[09:47:12] <erming> if you click event happens on an <a>-tag, you get that element as "this"
[09:47:28] <jorvis> ah ... that makes it easy.  Thanks, I'm obviously new to this.
[09:47:29] <erming> try it: alert($(this).attr("href"));
[09:48:21] <erming> because "this" is the element, not the jQuery-element, you'll have to wrap it: $(this) if you want to do naughty jQuery stuff
[09:48:52] <erming> jQuery object*
[09:49:47] <Sazpaimon> $("#someid").css('max-width') gives me pixels in firefox, but percentage in chrome. Any idea why?
[09:50:34] <Aven300> hello
[09:50:40] <Aven300> If we use jquery's .bind(), how can we pass parameters through it?
[09:50:46] <Aven300> Basically, I'm substituting onclick="blahblah(param1,param2)" to .bind("click")
[09:50:52] <Aven300> but I'm trying to figure out how to pass parameters through like I was able to with onclick
[09:51:34] <abishek> is $(ele).removeClass('label-*') a valid one?
[09:52:20] <erming> Aven300: what i usually do is this: <a href="" data-param1="Something"></a>, $("a").on("click", function() { var param1 = $(this).data("param1"); });
[09:52:44] * Aven300 spanks erming   
[09:52:48] <Aven300> I like that, thank you
[09:53:32] <erming> Aven300: found some more stuff about the data attribute if you want to learn more; http://www.broken-links.com/2010/11/18/data-attributes-in-html-and-jquery/
[09:54:51] <erming> abishek, don't think you can use wildcards with .removeClass()
[09:55:18] <maxmoore14> best practice question: http://jsbin.com/gacagene/1/edit
[09:55:19] <Aven300> ahh that's great thank you very much
[09:55:20] <maxmoore14> assume a large number of pages, better performance to have one event and use my own switch, or better to have multiple event handlers?
[09:59:23] <erming> maxmoore14: instead of using id selectors, can't you use a class?
[09:59:48] <maxmoore14> sure
[09:59:55] <erming> example: $(document).on("pageinit", ".init", function() { ... });
[10:00:08] <maxmoore14> regardless, my point is - each page is different
[10:00:11] <erming> but to answer your question: one event is probably nicer
[10:00:23] <erming> aha
[10:00:34] <maxmoore14> so the handler will need to do something unique for each page
[10:00:42] <erming> i'd go with one big event anyway
[10:01:09] <maxmoore14> that's my instinct too - just wondering if you know of a good reason to justify it
[10:01:26] <erming> performance-wise I don't think it matters
[10:01:42] <erming> but if they're not too big, it's probably easier to maintain with a switch instead
[10:01:53] <NoiseEee> just do it on a parent other than document
[10:02:22] <erming> and instead of $(event.target), you can probably use $(this)
[10:02:55] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: why?
[10:03:02] <erming> nvm, that won't work with $(document).on("pageinit"
[10:03:21] <erming> maxmoore14, where do you put #page1 and #page2 id's?
[10:03:25] <erming> on <body> ?
[10:03:40] <maxmoore14> no - they are divs - using jquery mobile
[10:04:25] <maxmoore14> the first page loads fully, then jqm uses ajax to pull in "pages" which are really just divs with a data-role="page"
[10:04:42] <TiMike> Hello, for an ajax GET request (jquery 2.0+) i was using success: and error: to set handlers… I saw there is a "complete" Should I be using that?
[10:04:43] <NoiseEee> oh not familiar with that at all, but i do see that pageinit has been deprecated for pagecreate
[10:05:33] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: yeah, I'm not concerned with the jqm specifics right now - just trying to determine best practice for event handling like this in general
[10:05:43] <maxmoore14> is there a reason not to attach events to document?
[10:05:56] <maxmoore14> I thought jquery does that internally anyway?
[10:06:06] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: because you're likely asking JS to monitor events on things that you're not interested in at all
[10:06:17] <NoiseEee> always better to specify if you can
[10:06:40] <NoiseEee> $('#menu').on('click','a',function() { //menu stuff only})
[10:06:56] <maxmoore14> ok
[10:08:27] <TiMike> was just wondering when it should be used
[10:09:46] <erming> TiMike: "complete: A function to be called when the request finishes (after success and error callbacks are executed). "
[10:10:13] <erming> if you need something to run when ajax is complete, no matter if error/success, then use it
[10:10:21] <TiMike> i see
[10:10:50] <erming> useful if you have something like an ajax preloader
[10:11:03] <erming> that you need to stop spinning or whatever
[10:11:05] <TiMike> so then you could have: all 3 in your ajax request…
[10:12:15] <TiMike> 1 more question….  is it possible to gran the status code if you make it into the error: ?
[10:12:26] <TiMike> gran= get
[10:13:34] <erming> TiMike: the documentation is a great resource: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[10:14:01] <Confoozed> hi folks - I have a handler bound to "mouseenter" in a grid item.  Inside the grid item is a label.  If the user rolls over the label, I want the mouse event to "bubble" up to the grid item so that no matter where the user rolls their mouse on the grid item, the even triggers.  right now, if they roll over the (hidden) label, the mouseenter doesn't trigger...
[10:14:07] <erming> scroll down to "error": "Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )"
[10:14:45] <erming> so use it like this: "error: function(jqXHR, status, error) { .. handle error here .. }"
[10:15:49] <TiMike> erming  - looking, thx
[10:35:32] <jorvis> erming: I tried using 'this' within my function callback, when but I do this.dataset it returns as undefined, even though the <a> in my generated source is like <a data-gene-id="1" href="#">
[10:49:27] <antlong> can anyone recommend a plugin that would be good for displaying storyline information in modal form, in a game? something that handles sequential windows or modals well
[10:52:42] <jorvis> I'm missing something important with the dataset attributes.  So in HTML an attribute like data-gene-id automatically gets transformed into a property called 'geneId' on the element reference?
[11:02:59] <erming> jorvis: use $(this)
[11:03:10] <erming> you have to put "this" inside the jQuery function to turn it into a jQuery object
[11:03:36] <erming> i need to go.. good luck!
[11:15:53] <sacho> jorvis, no
[11:18:43] <sacho> jorvis, html element attributes don't "create" dom element properties - dom elements properties are rigid and specified for a given dom element type
[11:20:09] <shoky> i think he meant element.dataset.geneId
[11:28:56] <BillCriswell> I kind of feel like apple doesn't want people in the web browser too much... makes sense for them.
[11:56:07] <naeluh_mondays> yo
[11:56:48] <naeluh_mondays> hey how can I check eveythig befor a character like in a zip 94560-5359 I want to check the string but everything before the "-" ?
[11:57:00] <naeluh_mondays> you get me
[11:57:09] <BillCriswell> What do you mean "check"?
[11:57:20] <BillCriswell> Like you just want 94560 in a variable?
[11:57:21] <naeluh_mondays> if the strings match \
[11:58:23] <naeluh_mondays> I am checking a json file and I want to get  that part of the zip cause most people only know the 5 digits
[11:58:24] <BillCriswell> You can do like.. zip = '94560-5359'; then start = zip.slice(0, zip.indexOf('-
[11:58:26] <BillCriswell> ');
[11:58:43] <naeluh_mondays> cool hell yeah!
[11:59:53] <BillCriswell> Can't believe apple was just like "We created a new programming language"
[12:00:17] <duch_kazatel> wait really?
[12:00:36] <duch_kazatel> lolwut they really did.
[12:00:38] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, the released a ton of shit just now, including a new programming language.
[12:01:00] <duch_kazatel> 5bux says it's going to be like actionscript.
[12:01:13] <BillCriswell> Haha I have no idea.
[12:01:28] <BillCriswell> At least then it'll be sorta JSish then I can learn it with a not as much effort.
[12:01:32] <BillCriswell> BEcause, I hate effort.
[12:01:46] <duch_kazatel> they really should just do ecmascript and call it a day.
[12:03:02] <naeluh_mondays> down with effort !
[12:03:20] <BillCriswell> This is the only way they're get me into iBooks anymore.
[12:04:56] <newview08> hello all, I'm trying to use a dialog in place of an alert on a form submission. the problem im having is that the button function isnt triggering the submit() -> http://jsfiddle.net/25w2h/
[12:05:10] <BillCriswell> The "Playgrounds" idea it uses is awesome. Sucks more languages don't utilize that.
[12:05:17] <newview08> if i put in alert("test") in place of the submit(), it alerts..
[12:05:36] <BillCriswell> I am almost certain it's why w3schools became so popular over the years haha.
[12:12:16] <silverdust> usually I have actions to be performed after an event e.g click,change,...
[12:12:31] <silverdust> how can I make changes just on page load
[12:12:38] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: https://developer.apple.com/swift/
[12:13:40] <BillCriswell> silverdust: You can just put the code in a document ready.
[12:15:13] <silverdust> BillCriswell: I have alert($('.myclass').css()) just in there
[12:15:18] <silverdust> and it gives nothing
[12:15:29] <silverdust> alert('hello'); works though
[12:15:52] <silverdust> the former gives me this in the console log
[12:15:54] <silverdust> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
[12:15:55] <BillCriswell> silverdust: What are you expecting from $('.myclass').css() ?
[12:16:28] <silverdust> I want it to give me all the properties and values given to .myclass from the css stylesheet
[12:17:08] <BillCriswell> That wouldn't be how .css() works, you could pass an array as the first argument and get an object of those properties back though.
[12:17:58] <silverdust> BillCriswell: how? Sorry I'm a jquery noob
[12:18:13] <BillCriswell> silverdust: Like... $('.myclass').css(['color', 'background-color']);
[12:18:20] <BillCriswell> You should use console log since alert is very limited.
[12:18:40] <BillCriswell> So try like console.log($('.myclass').css(['color', 'background-color'])); and look at your devtools console to see the output.
[12:19:59] <silverdust> BillCriswell: contents of the array will be properties I have already for that class I guess?
[12:20:20] <BillCriswell> Yes, unless you changed them in some way.
[12:21:22] <silverdust> ok thanks BillCriswell
[12:21:25] <BillCriswell> silverdust: http://jsbin.com/yapeyiwi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:21:26] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:22:05] <silverdust> this will work responsively I guess? as in change per screen width
[12:22:15] <silverdust> if I have media queries on that class per width
[12:22:56] <BillCriswell> silverdust: You'd have to log it on each resize to see the changes.
[12:23:12] <silverdust> ok
[12:23:38] <silverdust> wait a min, how do I handle for each resize?
[12:24:16] <BillCriswell> You'd have to look into the window resize event.
[12:24:19] <BillCriswell> Like this: http://jsbin.com/yapeyiwi/2/edit?css,js,output
[12:24:36] <BillCriswell> If you wanted to do it on a button click you'd just have to get the properties every time the button is clicked though.
[12:25:15] <BillCriswell> silverdust: http://jsbin.com/yapeyiwi/3/edit?css,js,output
[12:25:44] <BillCriswell> What I'm trying to say is the property won't live update, you'll need to update it on certain events.
[12:25:52] <BillCriswell> brb,need a drink.
[12:26:27] <silverdust> one more thing, why is $(document).on('click','.class',function(){}); prefered to $('.class').click(function(){}); ?
[12:26:35] <silverdust> ok thanks a lot
[12:27:06] <BillCriswell> silverdust: $(document).on('click', '.class') would work whenever the element is added to the DOM.
[12:27:27] <BillCriswell> The $('.class').click() would only work on elements that existed when the function was called.
[12:28:57] <silverdust> too much thanks to you
[12:29:10] <duch_kazatel> but try to bind lower if you can :)
[12:29:16] <silverdust> I should buy you a beer
[12:29:17] <silverdust> :D
[12:29:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah listen to duch_kazatel haha
[12:29:39] <BillCriswell> No problem, good luck!
[12:30:37] <silverdust> I don't know what that means? binding lower
[12:30:58] <duch_kazatel> the document part should be a parent element deeper in the tree.
[12:31:02] * silverdust makes :wrong use of punctuation:
[12:31:40] <silverdust> ok I'll try no to forge that duch_kazatel
[12:31:41] <silverdust> thank
[12:31:44] <silverdust> *thanks
[12:32:05] <duch_kazatel> that version of .on() is binding a delegation listener - try to bind to a parent that exists on pagelaod that isn't the document.  otherwise you end up having to check every click that happens, instead of ones that happen in that element.
[12:33:48] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.apple.com/swift/ - info on switft
[12:33:50] <duch_kazatel> *swift
[12:35:02] <zsoc> What is a reasonable way to set a unique parameter that's easy to grab from the event.target (ie: $("a").click(function(e) {, what do I want to check in 'e' to see something unique that I can set easily.. a class/name/id? ) ...
[12:35:10] <silverdust> like $('body') for example
[12:35:18] <duch_kazatel> silverdust even lower.
[12:35:42] <silverdust> ok I'll stick with that then
[12:35:46] <duch_kazatel> zsoc check out the docs for .on()
[12:36:13] <duch_kazatel> zsoc specifically, http://api.jquery.com/on/#passing-data
[12:36:37] <zsoc> duch_kazatel, great thankyou
[12:36:42] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: how can I convert object to string?
[12:36:54] <duch_kazatel> silverdust depends on the object...
[12:45:30] <duch_kazatel> generally stringifying objects points to a larger problem.  what problem are you trying to solve?
[12:45:45] <silverdust> this isn't logging on resize http://jsbin.com/yapeyiwi/5/edit
[12:46:13] <duch_kazatel> works forme.
[12:46:42] <systemfault> silverdust: Works for us.
[12:46:52] <zsoc> hm, I'm getting an "undefined is not a function" on e.target.hasClass("test"). e.target certainly exists, i'm dumping it in console.
[12:47:06] <duch_kazatel> zsoc try $(e.target)
[12:47:10] <duch_kazatel> or $(this) instead
[12:47:45] <zsoc> duch_kazatel, Yep. What do i read to find out why that worked? Lol.
[12:47:59] <duch_kazatel> zsoc e is the event object - that's not jquery.
[12:48:03] <duch_kazatel> .hasClass() is a jquery method.
[12:48:07] <zsoc> I guess because it's not using the jquery object... and hasClass is a jquery function.
[12:48:10] <zsoc> Right, wasn't thinking. Thank you :)
[12:48:11] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[12:48:21] <duch_kazatel> that's why i use $(this).
[12:48:35] <BillCriswell> Finding content in Drupal is... dreadful.
[12:49:34] <silverdust> systemfault: worsk on both jsbin console and your browser console?
[12:49:41] <silverdust> *works
[12:50:06] <systemfault> silverdust: Didn’t know jsbin had a console.
[12:50:22] <BillCriswell> I never use that tab.
[12:50:25] <silverdust> yea it does
[12:50:26] <BillCriswell> Er, panel.
[12:50:30] <silverdust> here's what I got
[12:50:31] <systemfault> But yeah, it also works in jsbin’s console
[12:50:34] <silverdust> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : chrome-extension://kchdfagjljmhgapoonapmfngpadcjkhk/js/jquery-1.11.0.min.map:1
[12:51:02] <silverdust> I'm using jquery 2.1.1 but I think somehow, my browser is referencing 1.11.0
[12:51:26] <BillCriswell> That seems like an issue with one of your plugins.
[12:59:09] <newview08> I'm trying to use a dialog in place of an alert on a form submission. the problem im having is that the button function isnt triggering the submit() -> http://jsfiddle.net/25w2h/
[12:59:44] <duch_kazatel> newview08 right, because you're preventing the default action.
[13:00:14] <duch_kazatel> event.preventDefault(); runs every time, regardless of where the submit event was triggere.
[13:00:17] <duch_kazatel> *triggered
[13:00:27] <newview08> ok, not sure how i go about ignoring that the second submit()
[13:00:40] <duch_kazatel> test to see where the event was triggered from.
[13:01:13] <newview08> the event was triggered from the dialog's "OK" button
[13:01:35] <newview08> oh, you mean programmically check
[13:01:39] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:01:42] <newview08> gotcha
[13:01:46] <newview08> will, do.. thanks
[13:07:07] <zsoc> I have an alert on .onbeforeunload that reminds the user he has some unsaved data... is there a way to trigger an event based on the user then staying? ie: only if he clicks the "stay on page" button (or whatever that browser responds)
[13:08:09] <newview08> duch_kazatel - it's saying 'object HTMLFormElement' for both submits
[13:08:31] <duch_kazatel> newview08 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692031/check-if-event-is-triggered-by-a-human
[13:08:32] <BillCriswell> zsoc: What kind of dialog pops up?
[13:08:35] <frank_o> Cork: I think I did it.. http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/6/
[13:08:49] <zsoc> BillCriswell, it's a js alert(), not a jq modal or anything.. not at the moment anyway
[13:09:24] <BillCriswell> zsoc: How does that stop them from actually exiting though?
[13:09:58] <BillCriswell> I don't think I'm familiar enough with it, but confirm() and shit returns different things based on what the user clicked. I don't see how one would lock you to the site?
[13:10:05] <newview08> nice, works.. thanks :)
[13:11:22] <zsoc> BillCriswell, depending on the client... the "Cancel" or "Stay" option would generally stop the unload action (back or close/closetab). For instance, on Chrome the options are "Leave this Page" or "Stay on this page"
[13:12:37] <BillCriswell> zsoc: Oh that's like it's own kind of dialog.
[13:13:37] <zsoc> BillCriswell, right, it's different for each client... but in my experience there is always one option that lets the user stop the unloading action. At least for 99% of my users on IE/firefox/chrome/safari
[13:13:57] <BillCriswell> zsoc: Yeah, I had no idea I never touched this.
[13:14:18] <zsoc> That's ok :) it's possible there's no good way to do it. I'll keep poking around.
[13:16:07] <BillCriswell> zsoc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8378179/how-can-i-get-the-return-value-of-onbeforeunload this seems like about the only way to approach it.
[13:16:53] <zsoc> BillCriswell, oh that might be an... interesting idea. thanks :)
[13:29:59] <frank_o> I got this Selectize (fancy select) here: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/6/
[13:29:59] <frank_o> But how do I set a global variables in one the onInitialize() function so I can use them in onDropdownOpen() and onDropdownClose()? It's not going too well -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/7/
[13:30:55] <__joshua___> frank_o: what exactly are you trying to do?
[13:30:57] <frank_o> ooh wait i get it
[13:31:10] <frank_o> __joshua___: my bad i shoulda explained the context
[13:31:27] <__joshua___> i see. just move 'var global' declaration to the top
[13:31:27] <frank_o> __joshua___: just trying to change "Choose option" to "Search..." once the user clicks on the select
[13:31:34] <frank_o> yep
[13:33:33] <frank_o> __joshua___: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/8/ strange, whats going on on dropdown close?
[13:33:47] <frank_o> It says "Choose o" and the rest gets cut off
[13:34:35] <frank_o> seems i gotta undo a width for some reason.. damn..
[13:34:39] <__joshua___> width is getting set to 49px
[13:34:57] <__joshua___> are you sure that is proper way to set default message?
[13:35:46] <frank_o> looking at their docs its all i could find
[13:36:44] <__joshua___> maybe call refreshItems() afterwards?
[13:39:12] <frank_o> __joshua___: sec
[13:40:22] <frank_o> __joshua___: i dont see that in the docs
[13:41:07] <__joshua___> this not the docs? https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[13:41:32] <frank_o> oooh that doc :D
[13:41:33] <frank_o> cool
[13:45:04] <frank_o> __joshua___: no deal unfortunately
[13:45:22] <frank_o> refreshItems(); inside onDropdownClose...
[13:47:03] <__joshua___> heh, you won't like this, but.... http://jsfiddle.net/Dnscf/9/
[13:47:35] <frank_o> omg that horrible lol
[13:47:39] <frank_o> :D
[13:47:50] <frank_o> but thanks nonetheless ofcourse
[13:52:39] <frank_o> __joshua___: prolly gonna go for this http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/12/ still horrible though
[13:53:09] <__joshua___> hmmm
[14:01:46] <duch_kazatel> weee
[14:03:35] <__joshua___> frank_o: that version of selectize is different from master
[14:04:10] <__joshua___> master only sets width on the input box on setup, but the min version has 22 instances of it
[14:06:41] <frank_o> __joshua___: 22 instances of width setting?
[14:07:01] <frank_o> somebody's clearly having a laugh
[14:08:43] <__joshua___> na, just 22 'widths' in min code.  was expecting 4.
[14:09:38] <frank_o> damn
[14:10:02] <frank_o> unfortunately i have no idea how to build the master
[14:10:53] <frank_o> is there like an online github-compatible grunt builder somewhere..
[14:11:34] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[14:13:06] <frank_o> __joshua___: you know what commit is responsible for clearing out those widths?
[14:13:39] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: making selectize.js' placeholder go from "Choose option" to "Search..." on click for improved UX: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/12/

[14:44:12] <nobitanobi> I have a <td> which has a form inside. When a radio button is clicked in that form, I want to be able to find a data attribute value located in the <tr> parent of that <td>. Here is how I do it: $(this).parents('tr')[0] --> If I console.log this, I see the <tr with the data-attribute there. But when trying to access it I get Undefined property
[14:46:32] <systemfault> nobitanobi: $(this).closest('tr').eq(0).attr('data-test') ?
[14:46:47] <nobitanobi> This did it: var approvalId = $(this).closest('tr').data('approval_id');
[14:46:58] <nobitanobi> thanks systemfault
[14:59:01] <Rainb> How'd you parse equations?
[14:59:23] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[14:59:30] <PerlWebDev> that's pretty vague, Rainb
[14:59:50] <Rainb> Hmm
[15:00:36] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?  what's the use case?
[15:01:07] <Rainb> Equations to Abstract Syntax Tree
[15:01:26] <Rainb> a tring
[15:02:10] <duch_kazatel> mind providing more context?
[15:03:15] <Rainb> 'There's a string, this string contains an equation in it, It uses identifiers and operators. And I want to parse it
[15:04:04] <duch_kazatel> there are a few libraries out there that will do that.
[15:04:11] <PerlWebDev> that sounds more general issues of parsing strings than jQuery
[15:10:12] <DobreJoe> Hello. I have a server side script that outputs car models when I pass the car brand as a GET variable. How do I get them with .get or .load so I can use those values as options in a select dropdown menu?
[15:10:47] <duch_kazatel> DobreJoe i'd use $.ajax() for that instead.
[15:11:14] <DobreJoe> ok, will look deeper into it
[15:11:15] <duch_kazatel> but either way, the get docs explain it pretty clearly.

[15:18:25] <guide_X> with jquery ui dragable, how do you know when something was dragdropped/snapped
[15:20:04] <__joshua___> the drop event?
[15:20:30] <guide_X> well the snap event in particular, i'm trying to figure out what snap spot it was dropped, and what was dropped
[15:21:43] <__joshua___> drop( event, ui ), ui.draggable is the element
[15:21:55] <guide_X> ah ok cool, let me check...
[15:24:27] <gudahtt> so, I'm slightly confused about the bower package. I noticed that the package for jquery was missing many of the files in the jquery repo, e.g. the gruntfile. as such, I'm unsure how to create a custom build of jquery using it. Perhaps that just wasn't meant to be supported?
[15:25:46] <duch_kazatel> not with bower.
[15:26:14] <duch_kazatel> bower doesn't do custom builds afaik
[15:26:18] <guide_X> sure the event isn't stop?
[15:26:38] <duch_kazatel> gudahtt you'll need something like requirejs to handle custom builds.
[15:26:59] <gudahtt> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks
[15:27:40] <gudahtt> I'm unsure why the 'src' folder in the bower package was included in that case. I was assuming it could be used for custom builds; maybe it has some other purpose *shrug*
[15:27:51] <duch_kazatel> aye, like using require.
[15:28:44] <gudahtt> oh; sorry I misunderstood.
[15:29:30] <naeluh_mondays> hey I need some advice
[15:30:03] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[15:31:29] <Rainb> naeluh_mondays: on what
[15:31:48] <naeluh_mondays> one sec I am settting up mys jsfiddle
[15:34:16] <gudahtt> duch_kazatel: so I could use require to create a custom build similarly to how the build.js grunt task does in the official repo?
[15:34:40] <gudahtt> that would make sense; essentially replicating that funcitonality. I can see why it wasn't included. a bit inconvenient though.
[15:34:51] <blindMoe> ahh.. didn't see it.  Don't think I was in the channel at that point
[15:34:56] <blindMoe> arg wrong window.. sorry ;)
[15:35:00] <duch_kazatel> gudahtt https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[15:35:02] <duch_kazatel> read the docs there.
[15:35:31] <gudahtt> yeah, that's where the file I'm referring to is, in build/tasks/build.js
[15:35:33] <guide_X> thanks alot guys, I got my droppable event working better
[15:36:34] <duch_kazatel> gudahtt requirejs is a loader, not a builder.
[15:36:57] <gudahtt> right; that file is the builder. it's a grunt task.
[15:37:02] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[15:37:14] <gudahtt> k, so we're on the same page :p  thanks for the help.
[15:37:32] <duch_kazatel> using require you could load only the bits you need.  you can also use the grunt task to make a custom build.
[15:37:52] <gudahtt> right on, understood.
[15:47:04] <guide_X> with jquery ui draggable/dropable, when using snap, how do you know which snap area you dropped your item on?
[15:52:40] <kevin> hey guys. say i'm creating several dom elements on-the-fly. is it better to use event delegation to create only one handler on the parent node, or create multiple handlers (that do the same thing) for the individual dom elements when created? and by "better" i guess i mean on any level of performance (memory, speed, etc)
[15:55:06] <duch_kazatel> kevin it depends on what you're measuring :)
[15:55:22] <kevin> yeah that's what i figured
[15:56:53] <duch_kazatel> kevin they both have benefits.  directly bound handlers are more efficient when it comes time for the click.  the handler doesn't have to really do much work.  it just sees that the click happened.  delegated listeners have to filter through every occurrence of that event.
[15:56:56] <duch_kazatel> that make sense?
[15:57:31] <kevin> duch_kazatel, yeah it does. and that's pretty much what i figured would be the case.
[15:57:48] <duch_kazatel> the tradeoffs are that you don't need to spend the overhead up front with delegated listeners - you bind once and only once.  you don't need to manage anything further.
[15:58:07] <duch_kazatel> the performance hit is minimal enough that delegation is OK imo.
[16:00:49] <naeluh_mondays> ok here is basically I get this error Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[16:00:56] <naeluh_mondays> http://jsfiddle.net/nhulea/Jqrfn/
[16:01:39] <naeluh_mondays> I am trying to search the json file and then return all the matches
[16:02:10] <naeluh_mondays> but for some reason my I am getting that error and no output of the json file
[16:02:13] <duch_kazatel> what line are you getting that error on?
[16:02:50] <naeluh_mondays> index:1
[16:03:39] <naeluh_mondays> its weird cause I have it working with regular json ajax call it works but I am not returning the right results
[16:04:07] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid json file.
[16:04:08] <duch_kazatel> that's why.
[16:04:21] <naeluh_mondays> ok hmm
[16:04:26] <duch_kazatel> JLISTS = JLISTS || {}; JLISTS.SETTINGS =
[16:04:29] <duch_kazatel> delete both of these lines.
[16:04:30] <shoky> it's also not a valid jsonp response
[16:04:58] <duch_kazatel> also you're doing this: JLISTS.SETTINGS = {}, {}, {}
[16:05:07] <naeluh_mondays> ok so do I need to add a callback ?
[16:05:26] <duch_kazatel> first create one pair of curlies that surrounds everything.
[16:05:32] <duch_kazatel> and get rid of those two lines.
[16:05:37] <shoky> curlies or []
[16:05:38] <duch_kazatel> then setup your app to accept a callback param.
[16:05:40] <naeluh_mondays> ok one sec
[16:06:30] <duch_kazatel> the callback QSP should then be used to wrap that object in a function call.
[16:07:48] <bePolite> Good day
[16:07:57] <bePolite> I have smth like 	$(document).on('click', 'p', function (e){console.log('hello'});
[16:08:13] <bePolite> how can I get the specific paragraph that was clicked??
[16:08:20] <duch_kazatel> $(this)
[16:08:24] <duch_kazatel> inside of your handler.
[16:08:32] <duch_kazatel> console.log($(this));
[16:09:05] <guide_X> with jquery dragable/dropable and snap, how do you know what you dropped your draggable object on?
[16:09:18] <guide_X> or which area you snapped into
[16:10:10] <duch_kazatel> check the event object in the drop event?
[16:10:25] <guide_X> oh ok duch.. thanks i'll look around in there
[16:10:50] <naeluh_mondays> ok so does this look better I am not getting the rror but it is still not returning anything ?
[16:10:52] <naeluh_mondays> http://jsfiddle.net/nhulea/Jqrfn/1/
[16:10:57] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop - check this out.
[16:11:12] <bePolite> Thanks duch_kazatel that worked
[16:11:29] <naeluh_mondays> I added the [] to the front and back and deleted the first 2 lines http://hulea.org/mail/newJlist.json
[16:11:51] <guide_X> lol, console.log(event.target);  could have guessed it, thanks again
[16:12:10] <duch_kazatel> guide_X check out the $(this) object there.
[16:12:19] <duch_kazatel> that'll have jquery methods all ready attached to it.
[16:12:28] <naeluh_mondays> wait a sec I messed up that file is now 24mb
[16:12:37] <guide_X> ok thanks duch
[16:13:12] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_mondays now you need to accept a callback QSP
[16:13:12] <guide_X> gosh I hope this thing works with touch too
[16:13:24] <naeluh_mondays> http://jsfiddle.net/nhulea/Jqrfn/2/
[16:13:25] <guide_X> hagven't checked yet
[16:14:31] <naeluh_mondays> so like callback:"QSP"
[16:14:41] <duch_kazatel> no
[16:14:48] <duch_kazatel> qsp = query string parameter.
[16:15:03] <duch_kazatel> http://hulea.org/mail/schoolInfo.json?callback=functionReference
[16:15:25] <duch_kazatel> then wrap your data in a call to functionReference()
[16:15:36] <duch_kazatel> so functionReference(/* your data here */)
[16:16:21] <naeluh_mondays> duch_kazatel: your data here is my json righ ?
[16:16:30] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:21:18] <naeluh_mondays> duch_kazatel: I am getting this error functionReference is not defined
[16:21:39] <naeluh_mondays> is this not correct http://hulea.org/mail/schools.json?callback=functionReference
[16:21:45] <naeluh_mondays> http://jsfiddle.net/nhulea/Jqrfn/5/
[16:22:03] <duch_kazatel> drop the callback= part from $.ajax()
[16:22:07] <duch_kazatel> in the url.
[16:22:27] <naeluh_mondays> ok
[16:23:07] <duch_kazatel> and then the code on the server-side should take whatever was passed to it as the function name.
[16:23:09] <duch_kazatel> not hardcoded.
[16:23:48] <Tomashe> Hey guys, a simple question about handlebarsjs , http://handlebarsjs.com/ , im in "Block Expressions" topic and there is an helper there.. but where should i put it, inside the template file or outside?
[16:24:21] <naeluh_mondays> weird I am still not getting any results
[16:24:36] <naeluh_mondays> $('#schoollist').append('<option value="' + schools + ',' + streets + '">' + schools + ',' + streets + '</option>');
[16:24:39] <naeluh_mondays> from that
[16:24:47] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_mondays are you taking the name of the function from the querystring?
[16:25:05] <naeluh_mondays> I removed it
[16:25:13] <duch_kazatel> on the serverside.
[16:25:14] <naeluh_mondays> http://hulea.org/mail/schools.json
[16:25:50] <duch_kazatel> the server needs to take the value of the callback quesrystring parameter and use that where you have functionReference right now.
[16:25:51] <naeluh_mondays> damn I think I am missing something
[16:26:23] <duch_kazatel> ^^ see what i just said?
[16:26:29] <duch_kazatel> jquery is requesting this URL: jQuery1110002196299397293866_1401751499908&
[16:26:33] <duch_kazatel> err, that callback function
[16:26:38] <duch_kazatel> or something like it.
[16:26:57] <duch_kazatel> so you need to setup your app so it automatically wraps the data in a function call named whatever jquery is asking for.
[16:28:25] <duch_kazatel> so your app should take the vallue of the "callback" query string param and use that value, instead of what you're using now.
[16:30:39] <naeluh_mondays> ok so I need to change the url that is being ajaxed ?
[16:30:44] <duch_kazatel> no
[16:30:49] <duch_kazatel> leave the js alone - it's fine
[16:30:53] <duch_kazatel> your server
[16:30:54] <naeluh_mondays> its the json
[16:31:09] <duch_kazatel> the server needs to be updated
[16:31:10] <uskerine> does anyone have a working example for editable datatables? http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/editable.html
[16:31:12] <uskerine> thanks
[16:31:12] <naeluh_mondays> my server where the url is coming
[16:31:21] <naeluh_mondays> from
[16:31:35] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_mondays http://hulea.org/mail/schools.json <- whatever is generating this needs to be updated.
[16:31:37] <shoky> naeluh_mondays: alternatively you can use   jsonpCallback: 'functionReference'
[16:32:22] <shoky> naeluh_mondays: but what you're doing in that loop is bad.. you're queueing a fadeIn for EACH iteration of the loop
[16:32:26] <duch_kazatel> http://hulea.org/mail/schools.json?callback=aString <- the server should be able to take whatever value from the callback argument and use that in place of functionReference in your returned data
[16:33:56] <naeluh_mondays> ok cool I got it work
[16:36:51] <naeluh_mondays> duch_kazatel: I am really are you saying that I need update the url everytime I want to querry something in the json ?
[16:36:57] <naeluh_mondays> I am really sorry
[16:37:30] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_mondays no need to be sorry - I'm saying your backend should automatically use whatever you send it.
[16:37:39] <duch_kazatel> you're telling it the name of the callback function to use.
[16:38:22] <duch_kazatel> it should use that automatically.
[16:39:45] <naeluh_mondays> so do I need to set something in nginx ?
[16:39:54] <duch_kazatel> what server-side language are you using?
[16:40:03] <duch_kazatel> this should be done in that language.
[16:40:05] <duch_kazatel> not nginx
[16:40:08] <naeluh_mondays> php?
[16:40:16] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:40:20] <naeluh_mondays> its index.php file
[16:40:40] <duch_kazatel> use php to grab the value of the callback querystring param and use that value to name the function you're calling back to.
[16:40:56] <naeluh_mondays> ok now I think I am understanding I thought you meant a server config thing
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> nope
[16:41:13] <naeluh_mondays> ok haha
[16:43:34] <naeluh_mondays> is there any particular reason I am 17343 objects ?
[16:43:43] <duch_kazatel> i dunno is there?
[16:43:55] <naeluh_mondays> I guess maybe there is
[16:44:00] <duch_kazatel> are you filtering down what you're requesting?
[16:44:31] <naeluh_mondays> noty particularly maybe I need to address that
[16:44:43] <uskerine> is there more than one Jeditable? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[16:44:44] <uskerine> ?
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> uskerine not that i'm aware of.
[16:45:27] <uskerine> i am reading that jeditable is expecting to send something to an url, can i just do some Jquery stuff instead of?
[16:45:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:46:14] <uskerine> i mean, Jeditable expects to POST something to a service, can I just do some manipulations in JQuery instead of doing AJAX?
[16:46:16] <duch_kazatel> uskerine jeditable is so you can save content after you've modified it.  could you explain what you're trying to do?
[16:48:06] <uskerine> I have a datatables with items, there is a couple of additional columns, one with quantity and one with total
[16:48:22] <uskerine> so I would like to make quantity cell editable and total to be automatically update (price * quantity)
[16:49:02] <duch_kazatel> then replace it with an input on click and update total on keydown or on change
[16:50:37] <BillCriswell> or in an input event.
[16:50:53] <uskerine> it might be easy question, but I prefer to ask rather than living in ignorance.... how can i replace it with an input on click?
[16:51:23] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You don't have to really.
[16:51:52] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You can just use some clever CSS to get around it.
[16:52:23] <uskerine> more help or guidance is really welcomed, my squills are limited and I am learning every day
[16:53:16] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I just use CSS. It's always an input, but I just make it look like an input when the element is :focus.
[16:53:23] <duch_kazatel> or do that.
[16:53:27] <BillCriswell> uskerine: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/11/edit here's a demo I made up a bit ago.
[16:54:03] <uskerine> thanks, i am checking
[16:57:04] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Do you use backbone a lot?
[17:00:23] <uskerine> i see, i will try that, seems easier
[17:00:28] <uskerine> thanks bill
[17:00:39] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I'm all about easy.
[17:00:58] <BillCriswell> Especially when it offers advantages haha.
[17:01:05] <BillCriswell> and there's almost no down sides.
[17:37:26] <Synthead> ("form").find("tr[id^='upper_deviation-'") returns Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: tr[id^='upper_deviation-'.  Why?
[17:40:55] <BillCriswell> Synthead: You forgot to close [.
[17:41:17] <Synthead> BillCriswell: OH YEAH!  Thanks!
[17:41:34] <BillCriswell> Synthead: Haha, they sneak by sometimes.
[17:43:17] <BillCriswell> Connecting my apple tv to the router through ethernet was brilliant. Don't know why I didn't do this sooner.
[17:47:16] <guide_X> with jquery dragable/droppable, when I use this... "$(this).append(ui.draggable);"   in the drop function after I snap to the desired area, there's an unwanted animation
[17:47:21] <guide_X> is there a way to prevent the animation
[17:48:18] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Do you have a CSS animation on that element?
[17:48:38] <BillCriswell> Can't recall ever seeing an animation by default...
[17:49:08] <guide_X> no animation I know of, it's not per say animation, but once dropped, it moves to the top of the screen, and moves back to my snap spot
[17:49:44] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Can you replicate it or show a demo?
[17:49:49] <guide_X> so I drop my draggable item, drop it in the snap spot, and then it moves the dragable item to the top of the screen, and backl the snap spot again
[17:49:55] <guide_X> sure let me try to make a jfiddle
[17:51:10] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[17:52:36] <guide_X> while I make the jsfiddle, here's a pastebin ... http://pastebin.com/iQHkCknM
[17:56:39] <BillCriswell> I need to read this the docs more.
[18:00:46] <BillCriswell> -this
[18:04:38] <guide_X> hmm odd, it wont drop in jsfiddle hmm
[18:04:40] <guide_X> still working on that
[18:04:52] <guide_X> maybe a screen cap would be easier..
[18:10:17] <BillCriswell> guide_X: http://jsbin.com/zunepu/1/edit?js,output here's a demo Ihave going.
[18:10:46] <guide_X> oh cool checking it out
[18:11:25] <guide_X> this is as far as I can get.. (appologies for the terrible alpha code) http://jsfiddle.net/U8ewm/  however, I can't get the drop event working in jsfiddle.. checking yours out
[18:11:55] <guide_X> oh interesting..
[18:12:15] <guide_X> it doesn't hav ethe problems mine does heh
[18:13:07] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Always seems to happen that way.
[18:15:38] <guide_X> ok got it to reproduce... http://jsfiddle.net/U8ewm/1/
[18:16:18] <BillCriswell> guide_X: I'm not really sure of the end goal here. What should I try to do?
[18:16:27] <BillCriswell> Oh I see now nevermind
[18:16:55] <guide_X> tiny bit cleaner  http://jsfiddle.net/U8ewm/2/
[18:18:45] <guide_X> BillCriswell: basically move the paperclips to the green area, and back
[18:18:48] <guide_X> and move a diff item etc
[18:18:58] <guide_X> but there's a weird animation during that process I can't seem to eliminate
[18:20:08] <guide_X> this is basically a license plate customization thingy
[18:20:13] <BillCriswell> guide_X: http://jsfiddle.net/U8ewm/3/ is this better/
[18:20:32] <guide_X> wow it sure is!
[18:20:36] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[18:20:46] <guide_X> cool thanks a million!
[18:20:51] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:21:10] <guide_X> ahh,           ui.draggable.css({top: 0, left: 0 }); hehe
[18:22:05] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Yeah, that gave me some issues when I first played with droppables as well.
[18:22:25] <guide_X> oic.. yeah this is also my first time playing with drag/drop
[18:22:31] <BillCriswell> guide_X: I can't tell if it should be done differently or not.
[18:22:41] <guide_X> it sure works though...
[18:23:08] <BillCriswell> I don't know if there's like a droppables.getItems or some shit.
[18:25:11] <BillCriswell> guide_X: I'm not positive adding it to the droppable itself is the best approach or not.
[18:27:07] <guide_X> hmm not sure either
[18:27:31] <guide_X> I moved the .css part more near here             $(this).append(ui.draggable);   .. that works a tad better
[18:27:39] <guide_X> so animations are preserved otherwise
[18:27:55] <guide_X> quite pleased with the result
[18:28:10] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Good stuff.
[18:32:51] <BillCriswell> Damn, all types of ladies looking at my linkedin. Must be my sexy picture.
[18:33:33] <BillCriswell> Can't blame them: https://media.licdn.com/media/p/7/000/271/33b/1eaec49.jpg
[18:43:44] <Vivekananda> hello everyone
[18:57:21] <in_deep_thought> why is it that with this code: http://bpaste.net/show/SAODgcfzwoAmwXhCq7jK/ the "hello" alert only shows up when I refresh the page while scrolled to the bottom? If I am at the top, refresh the page, and scroll down, nothing happens. I want the hello alert to happen when I scroll down
[19:01:05] <BillCriswell> You're not running it on scroll events, just when the document loads
[19:01:08] <Vivekananda> in_deep_thought: I am not very sure but I guess that the way you coded it , the document . ready is executed when
[19:01:30] <Vivekananda> yeah what BillCriswell said :).
[19:01:36] <in_deep_thought> ok so if I took it out of the document.ready then it should give the alert when I scroll to the bottom?
[19:01:56] <BillCriswell> No.
[19:02:17] <BillCriswell> You would need to put the function in an event listener for the scroll event of the window.
[19:02:46] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: :). Event listeners . I learnt it the other day thanks
[19:04:16] <in_deep_thought> BillCriswell, ok. well I am trying eventually to make a infinite scroll - this is just the first step. So If I wanted to do that, I would have the document.ready(), then inside of that, the event listener, then inside of that: if ($(window).scrollTop() == ....//ajax call for more content, etc. )
[19:08:43] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[19:17:37] <in_deep_thought> BillCriswell, how do I know what div the scroll event listener should act on? ("#some_div").scroll(function(){.......})
[19:18:32] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: It depends what element you want the infinite scroll on.
[19:20:55] <in_deep_thought> BillCriswell, what If I want additional list elements to load upon page scroll. This is my html- http://bpaste.net/show/m5jcTgJtLYYWs2oTlh94/ . should the scroll event listener act upon the ul class?
[19:22:38] <BillCriswell> It the element is overflow scrolled yes, but if you're just using it in a traditional sense you might want to do it just base it on the window.
[19:23:11] <in_deep_thought> What is overflow scrolled?
[19:23:37] <BillCriswell> Like if you have an element with overflow: scroll or auto.
[19:23:59] <BillCriswell> HEre is a pretty basic demo: <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex eveniet maiores ipsa magni ut est dolorem aspernatur sit fugiat totam sunt impedit alias quibusdam error fuga ad cum corporis neque.</p>
[19:24:02] <BillCriswell> Oops.
[19:24:08] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ciqiqube/1/edit?html,js,output *
[19:24:16] <BillCriswell> I'm glad that wasn't anything private.
[19:27:10] <in_deep_thought> ohh I see, no I'm not using overflow. the elements are not in a content box of any kind. So should something like this work: http://bpaste.net/show/gRy5u1ON5ybKstEXHFCV/
[19:27:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, the code I just shared with you is basically that with a few optimizations.
[19:30:40] <in_deep_thought> BillCriswell, so I see you didn't put it inside of a $(document).ready. Does the $window.on provide all of the event handling making that $(document).ready unnecessary?
[19:31:16] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: In depends where you run your scripts.
[19:31:58] <BillCriswell> If you're in the <head> you need to run the whole thing in document.ready, if you're putting it before like </body> you don't need to.
[19:32:34] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2451417/whats-pros-and-cons-putting-javascript-in-head-and-putting-just-before-the-body
[19:39:29] <in_deep_thought> yes mine is just before the body tag. Now this code: http://bpaste.net/show/gRy5u1ON5ybKstEXHFCV/ is making it so the hello alert shows up when I scroll to the top and then try and scroll down again. did I get the logic wrong in my if statement?
[19:40:53] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: console.log() things and it'll tell you what they are and you can figure out where your logic is off.
[19:42:19] <in_deep_thought> should I be able to log things like: console.log($(window).scrollTop()) ?
[19:42:30] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: Yes.
[19:45:24] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: You can log anything really, who elements, etc
[19:45:26] <BillCriswell> whole*
[19:51:22] <duch_kazatel> console.log ftw
[19:52:54] <BillCriswell> It's... a life saver.
[19:53:42] <duch_kazatel> remember life before?
[19:53:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Dark times.
[19:54:13] <duch_kazatel> window.alert()
[19:55:51] <BillCriswell> Worst is when you put on in a loop and didn't realize how many items were in it.
[19:56:32] <BillCriswell> OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK....
[20:17:50] <Joel> jQuery.post, if I set success to null, and call jQuery.post().done() it ends up being the same thing, right?
[20:21:15] <in_deep_thought> how can I put in an ajax call to load the next page to the div when there is a scroll event? right now I have this: http://bpaste.net/show/pdJLZUqBNuyGvz4amU5D/ but I am confused as to what to put in the url option. I have a pagination where every additional page is in that format. Where would I tell it to get the "2" to insert?
[20:59:46] <timgauthier> i'm a newb, but how do i put multiple complete: things in a function?
[21:16:27] <kevireilly> timgauthier: I don’t believe you can, but from the one you have, you can make it do multiple things / call multiple functions
[21:42:59] <naeluh_sat> howdy
[21:43:10] <naeluh_sat> what up
[21:44:17] <naeluh_mon> hey how is everybody
[22:16:54] <pragma-> /ignore naeluh_mon
[22:17:22] <naeluh_mon> pragma-: what ?
[22:43:49] <spygame> is there any way to access same variable in two different callback functions in jquery ?
[22:44:17] <duch_kazatel> spygame sure = scope it to a shared parent scope.
[22:44:33] <duch_kazatel> or pass objects around instead.
[22:47:23] <naeluh_mon> duch_kazatel: hey whats up someone ignored me haha
[22:47:33] <naeluh_mon> ]I got the /ignore for some reason haha
[22:47:34] <duch_kazatel> oh for real?!
[22:47:41] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_mon what'd you do?
[22:47:45] <naeluh_mon> yeah I barely even said anything
[22:47:50] <naeluh_mon> nothing
[22:48:06] <duch_kazatel> who was it by?
[22:48:12] <naeluh_mon> it was pragma- for some reason I said Hi everyone and then /ignoire
[22:48:22] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty awesome.
[22:48:23] <naeluh_mon> *ignore
[22:48:50] <duch_kazatel> well done.
[22:48:53] <naeluh_mon> yeah I was like hey what the and then I realized I am being ignored and they prob cant see my text ahah
[22:49:10] <naeluh_mon> it actually kinda random
[22:49:15] <duch_kazatel> that's weird.
[22:49:18] <duch_kazatel> wonder what's up.
[22:50:12] <naeluh_mon> yeah I am not sure myself it weould hgave made more sense in js irc cause I was actually typing quite a bot in there
[22:50:20] <naeluh_mon> bit
[22:50:22] <naeluh_mon> not bot
[22:50:32] <naeluh_mon> oh well haha cant win them all
[22:50:51] <duch_kazatel> life happens.
[22:51:01] <naeluh_mon> yeah
[22:51:40] <duch_kazatel> that was a helluva day.
[22:51:45] <duch_kazatel> i'm exhausted.
[22:51:59] <naeluh_mon> yeah I agree for sure
[22:52:57] <naeluh_mon> I am just so fucking stuck on this canvas stuff I hit a wall and I am so close I can taste it I am just missing one critical part I believe but I am going to spend some time rewriting my mouse function
[22:53:19] <duch_kazatel> hah.  i know there are others in here much more familiar with canvas than i am.
[22:54:16] <naeluh_mon> yeah wrd its weird I am trying to figure a way to use globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-out'; more than once or actually like 100s o time haha
