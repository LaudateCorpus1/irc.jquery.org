[11:22:28] <snatcher> is there a way to add !important style with jquery?
[12:07:29] <shoky> only with .attr() or .addClass()
[12:07:51] <shoky> jquery doesn't really "know" !important
[12:15:12] <makr8100> ^ this...  the annoying caveat is that when you're trying to override a theme's !important it may not be overridden by your !important.  the trick is to beat it with specificity in your css rule
[12:15:51] <makr8100> I largely blame themes that think they should use !important, which imho should never be done by a theme
[12:16:13] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[12:16:16] <robertmaxrees> or by anyone
[12:17:21] <makr8100> eh, I don't like it but it has its place
[12:17:26] <makr8100> there's a use case for everything
[12:17:40] <robertmaxrees> sure - when you're under a time crunch and can't fix the root issue.
[12:18:39] <makr8100> or when you've taken over a project that someone else started, it's all functional-style programming, and has ~10K lines each of php and js/jquery
[12:19:15] <robertmaxrees> right - in which your time constraint meants it's unreasonable to fix the root issue ;)
[12:19:22] <makr8100> the boss hasn't given me the go ahead for a full rewrite, and refactoring said project would take longer lol
[12:19:32] <makr8100> eh, fair enough
[12:19:46] <robertmaxrees> i've been at this game on enough codebases to know that to be true :)
[12:19:47] <makr8100> instead I get inundated with feature requests so the spaghetti code keeps adding up
[12:20:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.  at a certain point the cost of adding a new feature will be outweighed by the cost of a refactor.
[12:21:22] <makr8100> hey I have an idea, let's make a single php file called ajax_data.php and put this line of code: switch($querynumber) {
[12:21:44] <makr8100> we'll populate $querynumber with a value from the http post
[12:22:06] <makr8100> the number will be from 0 to 136 (and counting) and we won't have to have named functions :D
[12:22:14] <robertmaxrees> k
[12:23:22] <makr8100> thanks for coming to my rant lol
[15:11:55] <graingert> jpablo: yes
[15:12:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:47:58] <primitivMedia>                 var value = $(this).("option:selected").val();
[20:48:16] <primitivMedia> why is this returning  459 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[20:48:29] <robertmaxrees> a few reasons.
[20:48:44] <robertmaxrees> 1: $(this).("option:selected") isn't a thing.
[20:49:02] <robertmaxrees> 2: is 'this' a <select>?
[20:49:18] <primitivMedia> yes
[20:49:25] <robertmaxrees> just do $(this).val();
[20:49:51] <primitivMedia> ahhhh thank you sir
[20:50:14] <robertmaxrees> i think you meant $(this).find('option:selected') fwiw, but you don't need that here.
[20:50:34] <robertmaxrees> $('foo').('bar') isn't valid JS
[20:51:17] <robertmaxrees> when you have a dot, you need a property name after it.  () is just an expression - not a name.
[20:52:46] <robertmaxrees> welp
[20:55:44] <primitivMedia> ahh okay thank you for clarifying :)
[20:55:48] <primitivMedia> appreciate it
