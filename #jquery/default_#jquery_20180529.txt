[03:18:31] <devi8> anybody know of a good way to make a range slider for percentages...so multiple handles when added up all total 100%?
[03:32:10] <Cork> devi8: what do you mean?
[03:33:08] <devi8> I want a single bar with between 2 and ? handles that when dragged back and fourth change the percentage based on position
[03:33:52] <Cork> devi8: ya, that should be easy enough just grab the position on the handler minus the handles on the left and divide it on the total
[03:34:33] <iaj> hi folks :)
[03:34:48] <iaj> is there some way to write that in a more convenient way?   if (jQuery.cookie('ref') != 'fordoo' && jQuery.cookie('ref') != 'travixmedia' && jQuery.cookie('ref') != 'erfolgsteam2015') {
[03:34:57] <iaj> Eg if there are more than 3 different conditions to check for?
[03:35:54] <devi8> so would you use multiple range sliders? or just write your own drag handler or?
[03:35:55] <Cork> ![ 'fordoo', 'travixmedia', 'erfolgsteam2015'].includes(jQuery.cookie('ref'))
[03:36:32] <Cork> devi8: firstly are you using jquery ui slide?
[03:36:38] <Cork> +r
[03:36:43] <devi8> No, should I ?
[03:36:55] <Cork> what are you using then?
[03:37:06] <Cork> it affects quite a lot what you need to do
[03:37:23] <devi8> Starting from scratch. I will check out UI slider. thanks.
[03:37:50] <Cork> ui slider has built in support for multiple handles
[03:37:59] <Cork> that makes this fairly easy to do
[03:38:23] <Cork> you just have to bind the slide event
[03:38:42] <devi8> right on. Checking it out right now. Thanks.
[03:38:43] <Cork> (and don't forget change for if the bar was clicked)
[04:07:23] <V7> Hey all
[04:07:26] <V7> Is it possible to copy a html data to a clipboard ?
[04:07:39] <V7> an *
[04:18:12] <devi8> V7 do you mean programmatically using jquery? did you check almighty Google?
[04:21:02] <V7> Of course
[04:21:38] <pavonia> What did you found that doesn't do what you need?
[04:21:42] <V7> THere're a bunch of diffrent ways to copy a "plain" text, but there's nothing about a formatted one, like HTML ( i.e. image (<img> )
[04:23:00] <pavonia> Is that even possible?
[04:23:05] <V7> The main purpose of document.execCommand('copy') is to copy a selected text, but how to select an image and after that would it copy formatted element
[04:23:30] <V7> Of course, pavonia, try to copy it by mouse selecting and pasting to LibreOffice or sth. like that
[04:24:35] <devi8> So you want the user to select some html, then using jquery copy it to clipboard?
[04:24:36] <pavonia> As far as I know, you can only copy text from input fields, so that wouldn't allow copying formatted text
[04:25:09] <V7> devi8: Something like, but without selecting
[04:25:28] <V7> I mean, just an element in selectot
[04:25:29] <devi8> Do you have a non-working example in jsfiddle or codepen?
[04:25:30] <V7> selector *
[04:25:44] <V7> devi8: I'll create one
[04:25:45] <devi8> selector?
[04:26:15] <V7> $("#element")
[04:26:47] <devi8> $("#element").html() is text isn't it? why couldn't you copy that to the clipboard?
[04:34:40] <Cork> well .html is the inner html
[04:35:08] <Cork> you might want .prop('outerHTML') depending on what element you run it on
[04:41:59] <V7> devi8: https://jsfiddle.net/pbbfomwj
[04:43:29] <Cork> V7: it has to be a trusted event
[04:43:37] <Cork> so don't use event attributes
[04:44:14] <V7> Oh, Cork so how you would achieve this ?
[04:44:36] <Cork> not sure i can, to start with you need to use event listeners
[04:45:42] <V7> Updated: https://jsfiddle.net/pbbfomwj/1
[04:45:50] <V7> By they way this now works
[04:46:55] <Cork> V7: https://jsfiddle.net/pbbfomwj/2/
[04:48:16] <V7> Oh, understood Cork
[04:48:24] <V7> Althought, it copies a plain text
[04:48:52] <Cork> textarea can't format content
[04:49:00] <Cork> if that is what you mean
[04:49:10] <V7> Hm, so how then select a html data ?
[04:49:15] <V7> an html *
[04:49:22] <Cork> you are selecting the html
[04:49:41] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to select?
[04:50:07] <Cork> you want a snapshot of the page rendering?
[04:51:16] <Cork> xarg: damn... fix your nick you've been going on with that for days now...
[04:51:21] <V7> Cork: I think this could called like that. THe main question is to how copy a fomratted data of some element
[04:51:56] <Cork> V7: that question doesn't make sense
[04:52:50] <V7> For example, you can select it with mouse and a pressing on Ctrl+C will copy it to the clipboard. This would work on image element
[04:53:09] <V7> So, is it possible to achieve the same with jquery or javascript ?
[04:53:18] <Cork> ya, you get the html for the part you selected
[04:53:21] <Cork> just like you got here
[04:53:31] <Cork> but you also just get the selected text
[04:53:39] <Cork> if that is what you're looking for
[04:53:49] <Cork> you could try .text()
[04:54:38] <V7> Like insert a el.text() to textarea ?
[04:54:48] <V7> But wouldn't that copy the same plain text ?
[04:55:06] <Cork> you're not copying plain text
[04:55:11] <Cork> your coping html right now
[04:55:22] <Cork> if you want the text only you can grab .text()
[04:55:27] <V7> No no
[04:55:37] <Cork> if you want to render the html you copied you can't put it in a textarea
[04:55:44] <V7> I need a formatted HTML (rendered)
[04:55:52] <pavonia> I think they want to copy the text plus formatting
[04:55:58] <V7> Oh, so how then copy a rendered data ?
[04:56:00] <Cork> ya, but that is cause of where you put it, not of how you copied it
[04:56:05] <Cork> you don't
[04:56:25] <Cork> pavonia: the formating is the html
[04:57:24] <Cork> V7: you could try using a whyswig editor
[04:57:29] <V7> So, you're telling that it's not possible to copy a rendered data ?
[04:57:48] <Cork> it is, but it is not possible to use it in a textarea
[04:58:01] <V7> Cork: Ok, but how then >
[04:58:06] <Cork> as it only shows text, it doesn't render
[04:58:14] <Cork> see my last 5 lines
[04:58:41] <V7> I've understood that I don't need to copy a text to a textarea
[04:59:01] <V7> s/to a/to/
[04:59:08] <Cork> uhh...
[04:59:12] <Cork> read again
[04:59:41] <V7> Because textarea just shows a plain text, it doesn't render stuff
[05:00:00] <Cork> please read more then just the last line T_T
[05:02:00] <V7> I've read it 5 times
[05:02:05] <V7> The same
[05:02:09] <V7> DOn't use textarea
[05:02:21] <V7> execCommand(copy) already copies HTML data
[05:02:26] <V7> rendered*
[05:02:28] <Cork> ><Cork> V7: you could try using a whyswig editor <--
[05:02:34] <V7> Also, I could use whyswig editor
[05:02:42] <V7> But, why this is an option ?
[05:02:48] <V7> This is module
[05:02:50] <Cork> no, you need to use a whyswig editor if you want to edit html in it
[05:02:56] <Cork> cause a form field can't ever do that
[05:03:02] <V7> I don't to edit it, but just copy
[05:03:14] <V7> don't need *
[05:03:15] <Cork> but you want it in it
[05:03:23] <Cork> you can't show something the field can't handle...
[05:03:38] <V7> So, whyswig has an option to select a rendered data ?
[05:03:45] <Cork> textarea is for form submission, it can't do what you want
[05:04:00] <Cork> no, it is an option to show the html rendered
[05:04:11] <Cork> the copying isn't the problem
[05:04:27] <V7> I've udnerstood, you mean we need to use whyswig instead of textarea, but is there any other element which could handle rendered stuff ?
[05:04:45] * Cork gives up
[05:04:59] <V7> ...
[05:05:32] <V7> textarea can't handle a formatted data or just to format it ebcause it's not created for such purpose
[05:05:55] <V7> So there's whyswig element to handle this because it can work with already a formatted text
[05:06:02] <V7> That's why we have a BBCodes
[05:06:06] <V7> What's wrong ?
[05:06:38] <V7> Cork: Sorry, really, is there anything what I've msised ?
[05:06:45] <V7> missed *
[05:07:55] <pavonia> Cork: I'ts totally not clear to me what you're suggesting either. Copy the HTML code to a hidden WYSIWYG editor element, and then copy the transformed text from that to clipboard?
[05:08:11] <pavonia> It's not totally*
[05:08:19] <V7> pavonia: Yes, he suggested this I guess
[05:08:25] <Cork> pavonia: the copy copies the selected html, it is what is used if you want it rendered
[05:08:37] <Cork> you can't copy the image prepresentation of the selection
[05:08:48] <Cork> so the reseiving party renders the html
[05:08:56] <Cork> it is how webpage copying works
[05:09:22] <Cork> in this cause you see the html, cause the target (the textarea) can only handle text
[05:09:24] <V7> Cork: But how then mouse selection works ? I mean, is it possible to mouse select with javascript ?
[05:09:45] <Cork> you can put selection offsets in elements eys
[05:09:46] <Cork> *yes
[05:11:44] <Cork> V7: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6240139/highlight-text-range-using-javascript
[05:11:56] <Cork> i don't have a good example page on hand but they are out there
[05:13:33] <pavonia> Interesting, didn't know this were possible
[05:14:34] <Cork> pavonia: it is how contentEditable elements works (what makes whyswig editors possible)
[06:42:13] <V7> Thank you Cork
[08:14:21] <cannap> hi is there a way to get the original object back from an selector?
[08:14:26] <cannap> i try to use classList but its not working
[08:14:53] <cannap> floatingToolbar.classList.add('yellow')   because classList only adds the class when it not exists
[08:19:23] <cannap> nvm       floatingToolbar.get(0).classList.add('yellow')
[08:19:26] <cannap> maybe should read the docs
[08:28:08] <Cork> cannap: you can also use [0]
[08:28:18] <Cork> (it is what .get(0) does)
[08:28:39] <cannap> ahh
[08:29:17] <cannap> thanks
[08:29:34] <cannap> less extra calls are better :P
[08:31:34] <MikeD_> classList.add() vs addClass() ?
[08:35:07] <MikeD_> https://jsperf.com/jquery-addclass-vs-element-classlist-add  hmm... why is classList SO much faster?
[08:37:51] <MikeD_> oh, i guess i should have known *shrug*
[08:38:58] <Cork> MikeD_: one modifies the dom list one splits and joins unmutable strings
[08:39:37] <Cork> and ya, copying and gc:ing the string over and over again (tree times per iteration) costs
[08:41:51] <Cork> MikeD_: if you're curious https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/classes.js#L37 :)
[08:42:24] <Cork> so, ya pre classList code is kinda ugly
[08:43:59] <MikeD_> yeah  "clazz" heh
[08:44:37] <Cork> it is basically a big array walker loop
[08:45:57] <MikeD_> i guess that was conceived to have relatively few entries in that array... but then people go and make some absurd lists of classes
[08:46:33] <Cork> or loop and set addClass/removeClass/toggleClass in a setInterval :)
[08:47:00] <MikeD_> garbage in, garbage forever
[08:47:10] <Cork> i suspect jquery will drop the built in version of class modification quite soon
[08:47:21] <Cork> maybe version 4
[08:47:43] <Cork> need to lose win7 first though >_>
[08:54:04] <preference> is there a way to wrap an element inside a new div from dev tools?
[08:54:22] <preference> like, create an element
[08:55:35] <preference> nvm, figured out how to do it :)
[09:20:36] <sine0> can I use jQuery to insert html into a page somewhere. I need to add something to a wordpress website above the header, there is not a hook there and I can edit the theme
[09:21:38] <preference> yes
[09:21:43] <Cork> sine0: you can insert it on the same website you are running on
[09:21:47] <Cork> but not others
[09:22:01] <sine0> heh
[09:22:17] <Cork> i have gotten those questions if you wonder :)
[09:22:21] <sine0> what you mean I cant insert jquery into another persons website
[09:22:23] <sine0> lame
[09:22:53] <Cork> sine0: all you need to modify the current page is a selector that targets the place you care about
[09:28:03] <preference> sine0: i believe that if you could insert jquery into other peoples' websites, you could really mess things up for them by changing e.g. font sizes =/
[09:28:23] <Cork> preference: it was irony
[09:28:48] <preference> Cork: i'm not sure, jquery/javascript can't really do much harm to a website afaik :)
[09:28:59] <Cork> heh, well i am :)
[09:31:22] <preference> Cork: pretty sure that no website has ever been hacked by anonymous with javascript. vb.net is what causes most website issues imo
[09:31:35] <Cork> preference: sure it has
[09:31:40] <Cork> it even have a name
[09:31:43] <Cork> (xss)
[09:32:17] <Cork> though it normally depends on server code not validating the input
[09:32:22] <preference> ya, css hacking can really do some harmful things
[09:32:26] <Cork> but it has happened through js too
[09:32:35] <Cork> preference: uh... what?
[09:32:38] <Cork> xss is not css
[09:32:51] <Cork> xss is Cross Site Scripting
[09:33:05] <preference> Cross Site Scripting = CSS ?
[09:33:15] <Cork> -_-'
[09:33:16] <Cork> no
[09:33:24] <preference> sorry Cork, i'm just messing with you :)
[09:34:10] <Cork> quite a few things can leak from a page through xss, like password, emails, creditcard numbers and so on
[09:34:36] <Cork> and worst part is, you might not even see it server side
[09:43:15] <sine0> folks what do I use to insert html inside of html then
[09:43:36] <sine0> do i just basically spit a string of text that so happens to be html within another element
[09:43:41] <Cork> you don't insert html, but dom element
[09:44:21] <Cork> just target the element you want to append to and $(target).append($('<div>', { text: 'content' })); or what ever you need
[09:44:51] <Cork> sine0: you might want to read through http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[09:53:41] <sine0> thanks
[09:58:32] <sine0> Cork: if i want to target the body tag do I use 'body' as target
[09:58:41] <Cork> yes
[09:59:06] <sine0> jQuery('body').append(jQuery('<div>', { text: 'this is the test inside' }));
[09:59:29] <sine0> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[09:59:31] <sine0> woops
[10:01:42] <sine0> not working. i wonder why
[10:01:52] <Cork> sine0: https://jsfiddle.net/z560kaey/
[10:02:01] <Cork> you append it ends up at the end of the page
[10:02:18] <Cork> (just guessing though as i haven't seen what you're doing)
[10:03:15] <sine0> i prepend
[10:03:37] <Cork> make sure you run it after the body has been parsed
[10:06:07] <sine0> yea i queued it last at the bottom of the page after everything else
[10:06:40] <Cork> might be you have something absolute positioned or fixed on the page covering the text you add
[10:06:49] <Cork> use the dom inspector
[10:07:03] <sine0> im just trying a simple test at the moment
[10:07:12] <sine0> jsut to get it to insert something
[10:07:26] <sine0> <script type="text/javascript">
[10:07:26] <sine0>     jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[10:07:26] <sine0> 		jQuery('div#page').prepend('wootcakes');
[10:07:26] <sine0>     });
[10:07:26] <sine0> </script>
[10:07:42] <Cork> don't paste html in the channel (or multiple lines at all for that matter)
[10:07:52] <Cork> use jsfiddle
[10:08:01] <Cork> i gave you a working example a few mins ago
[10:08:06] <Cork> lab with that
[10:18:48] <Cork> sine0: btw don't add things infront of ids, they are already as exact (and fast) as they can be
[10:18:58] <Cork> so jQuery('div#page') => jQuery('#page')
[10:20:24] <sine0> oh yea i do that
[10:20:33] <sine0> it is working
[10:20:45] <sine0> but what i didnt realise is that its not doing what i wanted it to do :D
[10:20:50] <Cork> ya, but it is making the selector harder to read and slower
[10:21:05] <Cork> sine0: it does, but it does more then it need to
[10:21:08] <sine0> its behind the header/navbar which has got abs pos i think
[10:21:33] <sine0> jQuery('body').prepend('<div class="sz-top"><p>meep</p></div>');
[10:21:34] <Cork> ya, you most likely want to add it in the header not directly in the body
[10:21:51] <sine0> i just want to have a div at the top of the page above everything with a message. thats it
[10:22:08] <Cork> sine0: and you're ok if it covers the header element?
[10:22:21] <sine0> i want it to push that down underneath it
[10:22:36] <Cork> ya, can't do that if it is absolute positioned
[10:22:55] <Cork> you will have to modify the css of those elements to leave space for the new elementy
[10:23:01] <Cork> -y
[10:23:02] <sine0> bah ok.
[10:23:13] <sine0> after all that. thanks
[10:23:49] <Cork> well you can possibly do it if is it absolute positioned, but it is very likely that it is fixed, and then you can't
[10:26:32] <preference> sine0: on wordpress?
[10:26:38] <Cork> yes
[10:27:01] <preference> https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-notification-bar/ it's possible
[10:30:25] <sine0> I have done it folkls
[10:31:26] <sine0> ok say an element has a style applied to it and you dont know what class, can I create a style="color:red!important"
[10:31:33] <sine0> to override it
[10:31:40] <preference> !important will override
[10:31:55] <sine0> I know but how do I add the style= to it
[10:31:59] <Cork> except important doesn't work in style attributes
[10:32:09] <noahsiano> so $('.my-class').children()[0]; returns the first child, but $('.my-class').children()[0].children()[0]; returns a TypeError. What's the best way to navigate the DOM down more than one child?
[10:32:24] <noahsiano> Been googling this for a lil bit, figured I'd ask here
[10:32:37] <Cork> sine0: if the stylesheet is constructed correctly you can just set the color directly on the element
[10:32:48] <Cork> sine0: if the stylesheet has !important, you can't
[10:32:56] <sine0> it does not have important.
[10:33:02] <Cork> sine0: .css('color', 'red') should work then
[10:33:05] <sine0> thanks
[10:33:21] <sine0> .css('padding-top', '0')
[10:33:25] <sine0> will also work i hope
[10:33:25] <Cork> noahsiano: [] returns raw dom elements
[10:33:31] <Cork> yes
[10:33:50] <Cork> sine0: if you need to add a lot of those i would recommend adding a new class to your stylesheet and using that
[10:33:56] <Cork> makes maintaining MUCH easier
[10:34:24] <Cork> noahsiano: also if you need to go multiple levels down it is normally better to use .find()
[10:34:37] <noahsiano> ah, .find() is what I'm looking for
[10:34:40] <Cork> like .find('> span > a') or something
[10:35:23] <noahsiano> so in my example, could I do $('.my-class').find('> div > h1'); to return the double-nested h1 element?
[10:35:51] <Cork> it would give you all h1 elements that is a direct decentent of div and it of .my-class
[10:36:04] <Cork> $('.my-class > div > h1') would give you the same thing
[10:37:02] <noahsiano> oh that's much easier
[10:37:19] <Cork> also if you don't have multiple h1 in the  .my-class
[10:37:21] <noahsiano> And if [] selects raw html, how do i select the first one for manipulating?
[10:37:30] <Cork> a faster selector would be $(.my-class h1')
[10:37:46] <Cork> .first()
[10:38:00] <noahsiano> wow, i knew that... it's been a while since I've used jquery, thanks
[10:38:35] <Cork> (with css selectors less is more :) )
[11:05:43] <AdamPDotty> .find('>span') ?
[11:05:45] * AdamPDotty wonders
[11:06:03] <Cork> AdamPDotty: what?
[11:06:45] <AdamPDotty> Does that bring a result?
[11:06:52] <Cork> sure
[11:07:04] <Cork> it is the same thing as .children('span')
[11:09:42] <Cork> AdamPDotty: https://jsfiddle.net/nqcq7v5g/
[11:10:02] <AdamPDotty> found a site that has jquery, so I could test there :-)
[11:11:33] <AdamPDotty> I would have expected you need at least a * in front of that.
[11:20:06] <noahsiano> AdamPDotty, you can always just go to jquery.com to test your jquery stuff lol
[11:51:20] <V7> Cork: Found. Check this one https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23934656/javascript-copy-rich-text-contents-to-clipboard#comment82600859_39497923

[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean the name attribute contains [id]?
[12:50:06] <dimi1947> yes...I do not want that to be targeted...
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> .filter
[12:50:17] <robertmaxrees> then .map
[12:50:38] <dimi1947> can you write the code please?
[12:51:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> also: you're using the wrong .map()
[12:51:34] <dimi1947> I want to trgat the digit
[12:51:44] <robertmaxrees> here's your one freebie for the day: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r3v1rL7y/2/
[12:51:44] <dimi1947> I want to target the digit
[12:51:55] <robertmaxrees> "i want to target the digit" huh?
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean the number after the form[update]?
[12:53:00] <dimi1947> Is was complicated after...sorry for asking you to do this but I am a little stressed...for other reasons
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> fix your backend and add a data-index value.
[12:54:35] <dimi1947> why to add a data-index value...what is the point
[12:54:50] <robertmaxrees> so that way you aren't parsing the name attribute for it.
[18:46:11] <dhecar> hello, i want to show hide li elements with a button click and based on data attr value in <li> node, but for some reason my code doesnt work, https://pastebin.com/htN2AcMr   what could be the problem

[19:36:55] <spaces> meh I did a 25% refactor over my overall refactor again, I'm almost there
[19:36:58] <spaces> what a day
[21:37:32] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/znnL71zu/  i want replace only value and text inside of my text instead of full html line
[21:37:50] <Rockwood> i think .html is not suitable for me
[21:38:05] <Rockwood> is it possible by jquery ?
[21:46:22] <Rockwood> $(".something").attr( { title:"Test", alt:"Test2" } );  am right ?
[21:50:07] <Rockwood> i think .data is nice for this work
