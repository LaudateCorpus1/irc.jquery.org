[02:30:09] <fedek> Thanks any way !!!
[03:18:35] <dexteruk> Hi everyone, I have a <div id=content> inside this i want to load a layout file that has another set of divs i have tried .load() but that does seem to the be the right
[03:18:41] <dexteruk> way to do it
[03:26:35] <Cork> dexteruk: .load it what you want yes
[03:26:54] <Cork> $('#content').load(url) to be exact
[03:27:30] <dexteruk> I have tried that, but it load the url but then it sends a second get undefined
[03:28:09] <dexteruk> its as if it could not find the url, but when i load the url in the browser it return the .html file
[03:29:39] <Cork> dexteruk: check the browsers network tab
[03:29:45] <Cork> might be the server does a redirect
[03:30:02] <Cork> note server might make a difference between ajax calls and normal browser loads
[03:30:44] <dexteruk> and how would that effect .load?
[03:30:52] <Cork> check the network tab
[03:33:23] <shield> hello every, I
[03:33:28] <dexteruk> ok it returning that 304 nothing changed for that file, it says its text/html
[03:33:37] <shield> I am new to Jquery
[03:33:49] <Cork> hmm
[03:33:53] <dexteruk> but when i look at the view source, the div has not changed
[03:34:09] <Cork> dexteruk: could you make a jsfiddle with the code you're using?
[03:35:21] <Cork> shield: if you have a question, just ask it
[03:36:26] <dexteruk> i can try, its a little bit complicated as its a websocket that is recieving data from the server
[03:36:43] <dexteruk> and that is telling jquery to change the layout
[03:36:47] <dexteruk> at least thats the idea
[03:36:48] <Cork> dexteruk: you don't need to go that far out
[03:37:03] <Cork> just go from where you want to load the new content
[03:37:19] <Cork> the code doesn't have to work, i just need to see the context of the .load call
[03:38:24] <shield> thinks, cork, I see a word “The reason this fails is that the code executes myCallBack( param1, param2 ) immediately and then passes myCallBack()'s return value as the second parameter to $.get(). ”
[03:39:04] <Cork> that's not a word but ok
[03:39:43] <shield> I can not understand the why the sencond parameter to $.get()
[03:40:02] <Cork> second parameter?
[03:40:25] <shield> yes, "then passes myCallBack()'s return value as the second parameter to $.get(). ”"
[03:40:31] <Cork> shield: are there a specific line of code you're working with? or are you just reading in the abstract?
[03:41:02] <shield> i
[03:41:16] <shield>  I am learning jquery on http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[03:42:03] <Cork> ok $.get( "myhtmlpage.html", myCallBack( param1, param2 ) );
[03:42:23] <Cork> "myhtmlpage.html" is the first parameter and the return value from  myCallBack( param1, param2 ) is the second
[03:43:08] <Cork> what they are trying to explain here is that in javascript you pass functions as references with the name of the function without ()
[03:43:19] <Cork> shield: and if you type it as name() it executes it
[03:46:21] <dexteruk> Crok: https://jsfiddle.net/qLL7u3rd/#&togetherjs=av9eprhTGL
[03:46:42] <Cork> sigh timeout so all that typing for nothing -_-'
[03:47:08] <Cork> dexteruk: there's no context for the .load call at all
[03:47:15] <Cork> there really isn't any context?
[03:50:44] <dexteruk> Cork: Ok i have added the rest of the code around it
[03:51:06] <Cork> hmm
[03:51:19] <Cork> that really shouldn't cause that kind of problem...
[03:51:34] <Cork> except...
[03:51:40] <Cork> no...
[03:52:09] <dexteruk> the this line was something else i was trying
[03:52:31] <dexteruk> if the div is not empty
[03:52:42] <dexteruk> will load replace it
[03:53:32] <Cork> dexteruk: the js is correct as far as i can tell
[03:53:43] <dexteruk> yey
[03:53:50] <Cork> so i would recommend checking closer what the server actually returns
[03:54:04] <Cork> check if the response have a location: header for example
[03:54:17] <Cork> or if there are any js in the response
[03:55:30] <dexteruk> in the network i see no headers that say location
[03:55:59] <Cork> ya, was just suggestions
[03:56:14] <Cork> i really can't help you much more without actually debugging the real site
[04:02:26] <dexteruk> Cork: in Chrome, under network the type is xhr
[04:02:33] <dexteruk> for the html file
[04:02:48] <Cork> ya, that's correct
[04:02:59] <Cork> check the content for the request though
[04:03:32] <dexteruk> is that, what it means or are you asking me to check
[04:03:38] <shield> sorry, I was offline
[04:03:51] <Cork> dexteruk: xhr means its an ajax request
[04:04:11] <Cork> (stands for XmlHttpRequest and it isn underlaying javascript api used)
[04:05:02] <Cork> shield: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[04:10:09] <shield> oh, thanks for your help, Cork
[04:17:52] <dexteruk> Cork: Are you still here
[04:18:00] <dexteruk> I think im one step closer
[04:18:41] <dexteruk> Cork:  Thanks for your help by the way its much appreaciated
[04:19:07] <Cork> dexteruk: np
[04:19:45] <dexteruk> Ok, i moved the .load to a completely empty div at the end
[04:20:03] <dexteruk> i see the content of that .load being loaded on the screen
[04:20:30] <dexteruk> but when i click on view-source i see no change in the div
[04:20:51] <Cork> dexteruk: view source only shows the original page
[04:21:07] <dexteruk> oh so it may have been working all the time :-(
[04:21:18] <Cork> you need to use the source tab in the developer tools
[04:21:25] <Cork> sorry
[04:21:27] <Cork> the elements tab
[04:22:18] <dexteruk> so the next question, i should be able to reference the div as if they exist
[04:22:28] <dexteruk> ie .hide .show
[04:22:39] <dexteruk> update text etc
[04:23:14] <Cork> as long as they exist in the page when you check for them yes
[04:25:10] <dexteruk> ah you see chrome shows the div as its updated
[04:25:20] <dexteruk> and firefox does nt
[04:25:28] <ctmarco> Hello i need make validation
[04:25:45] <ctmarco> and ajax
[04:25:50] <ctmarco> ANyone can help
[04:26:14] <Cork> dexteruk: if you use the "inspector" in firefox it should show you the same thing
[04:26:33] <dexteruk> Cork: Thanks for your help.  Its been a real nice thanks for the help
[04:26:47] <Cork> dexteruk: you're welcome
[04:27:05] <Cork> ctmarco: you might want to have a look at jquery.formvalidator
[04:27:21] <ctmarco> COrk i  want make it by self
[04:27:33] <Cork> that's fair
[04:27:40] <Cork> so what's the question?
[04:28:12] <ctmarco> Cork How i can make validation into on submit event
[04:28:23] <ctmarco> In which place i need vlaidate items
[04:28:29] <ctmarco> ANd to prevent them from submiting
[04:28:44] <Cork> ctmarco: i would recommending setting classes on the elements for what type of validation they should have
[04:29:05] <ctmarco> Cork for email vlaidation i need regular expression
[04:29:09] <Cork> and then just do $(this).find('.require.email').each() or similar on those elements
[04:29:27] <Cork> and if you find an error call event.preventDefault() and mark the field as invalid
[04:29:44] <Cork> ctmarco: the validation just goes on $(field).val()
[04:29:56] <ctmarco> ok
[04:30:02] <Cork> ctmarco: alternatively you can use the built in validation in html forms
[04:56:07] <TheWild> hello
[04:56:43] <TheWild> what's the difference between attachments.remove('.x-attachment') and attachments.find('.x-attachment').remove() ?
[04:58:32] <Cork> TheWild: https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.remove
[04:58:34] <Cork> none
[04:58:45] <Cork> hmm opps sorry
[04:58:58] <Cork> TheWild: .find will find children with the matching selector
[04:59:16] <Cork> .remvoe('selector') will remove elements in the result set matching the selector
[04:59:29] <Cork> same as attachements.filter('.x-attachment').remove()
[04:59:58] <TheWild> ah, this is equivalent filter, not find.
[05:00:05] <TheWild> thanks Cork
[07:55:44] <KlausedSource> hey everyone! I have a question. this is my html: https://jsfiddle.net/k9s1sjoL/1/
[07:56:45] <KlausedSource> i can reference all "answers" which are childs of "item-x" with var answers = $('#item-' + itemID+ ' > ol.answers');
[07:57:46] <KlausedSource> but i can't figure out a way to access all spans with .icon which are childs of ol.answers
[07:58:01] <KlausedSource> i want to .toggle() them all at the same time
[07:58:17] <KlausedSource> i hope it is understandable what i wrote if not pls ask
[07:58:57] <pavonia> ' > ol.answers span.icon' should work
[07:59:36] <KlausedSource> $('#item-' + itemID+ ' > ol.answers span.icon') ?
[07:59:42] <KlausedSource> pavonia,
[07:59:46] <pavonia> Yes
[08:00:03] <KlausedSource> i will try it, thx
[08:00:30] <pavonia> '>' indicates direct children, ' ' are all descendents
[08:06:24] <uskerine> hi,  statusCode: { 200: function() { ... } }
[08:06:35] <uskerine> can I make function work for more than one statusCode at the same time?
[08:06:46] <uskerine> something like
[08:07:00] <uskerine> statusCode: { 200,410: function() { ... } }
[08:08:58] <pavonia> uskerine: I don't think you can put two codes at one place, but you could define give the function a name and use it in several fields
[08:09:24] <pavonia> like { 200: myFunc, 410: myFunc, ... }
[08:12:32] <KlausedSource> pavonia, it is working nice. had to fix my code
[08:12:50] <KlausedSource> pavonia, but your answer did the trick
[08:12:57] <KlausedSource> thanks a lot
[08:13:09] <pavonia> No problem
[08:17:41] <Cork> uskerine: the best option is to just bind the always() handler and check the status code ther
[08:17:54] <Cork> then you can combine them anyway you want
[08:38:02] <uskerine> thanks pavonia / Cork
[08:45:46] <uskerine> https://jsfiddle.net/3vsyL6z7/
[08:45:58] <uskerine> any tip on why the text for hte input field is not updated via jQuery?
[08:52:12] <uskerine> Ok, so this works: https://jsfiddle.net/3vsyL6z7/1/
[08:52:22] <uskerine> but this does not work, because of the period in the name: https://jsfiddle.net/3vsyL6z7/2/
[08:52:45] <uskerine> can I use '.' as part of the id? and if so, which selector shall I use?

[10:27:25] <nolakjo> Anybody ever have an issue with Safari not displaying a query its asked? It displays all the results instead of what you asked for in drop downs.
[10:31:48] <Ice_Strike2> Is here anything wrong with this?

[10:36:50] <Ice_Strike2> Awesome thanks
[11:46:38] <sportman> silly question. if i have 200 instances of a class on a page. is it better to do jQuery('.class').css('display','none'); or to actually insert a style override like jQuery('body').append('<style>.class{display:none}</style>');
[11:55:45] <NaviNick> How would I go about parsing out an iFrame DOM so that I can find and replace the any string '2017' with the string '2018', but NOT replace value attributes such as: value="2017" ? I tried a dirty regex but I've learned that you should never parse HTML with regex. :/
[12:00:11] <taplar> sportman: either do an inline or use a pre-existing class
[12:00:36] <taplar> dynamically creating a script to affect elements is slightly odd
[12:00:43] <taplar> r/script/style
[12:03:32] <sportman> taplar:  yea i suppose
[12:03:43] <sportman> there just will be a lot of them adjusted, but i suppose inline works fine
[12:07:59] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to use $.when().then() in a userscript, but the .then() doesn't appear to trigger. When I run the same segment in the developer tools console, it works perfectly fine. Is .then() unusable in userscripts?
[12:08:24] <robertmaxrees> it's totally usable.
[12:08:30] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you use .fail() instead?
[12:08:36] <robertmaxrees> or .catch()
[12:10:17] <tsukasadt> I didn't know those could be used with .when(), it's not listed in the documentation. :S
[12:13:10] <tsukasadt> Ass .fail() reports status 200, statusText "OK". :S
[12:13:19] <tsukasadt> Adding*
[12:14:32] <tsukasadt> It even has the responseText, which doesn't seem right, since a failure shouldn't be "OK". Or am I misunderstanding something?
[12:18:05] <robertmaxrees> it can be invalid data.
[12:18:09] <robertmaxrees> are you setting dataType?
[12:20:22] <tsukasadt> No, I'm not, should I add that to the .ajax()?
[12:20:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:20:41] <robertmaxrees> something seems amiss.
[12:21:20] <tsukasadt> I don't know what, though. It works fine via console, fails via userscript. :S
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> share the code?
[12:24:38] <mikunos> hi guys how have I to call a new request inside the onComplete event?
[12:25:19] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/t2puaL9o/
[12:25:28] <mikunos> https://jsfiddle.net/t2puaL9o/#&togetherjs=TuEMVRQU5x
[12:26:00] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, https://thepasteb.in/p/Lghpcmv4L658GcW
[12:26:01] <robertmaxrees> mikunos ask in ##javascript
[12:27:17] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt woah wait.
[12:27:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing async: false ?
[12:28:33] <mikunos> robertmaxrees done
[12:28:42] <robertmaxrees> mikunos 'kay.
[12:30:02] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, The follow-up lines in the .then() won't run properly without it.
[12:30:19] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt this is the wrong way do handle this tbh.
[12:30:42] <tsukasadt> Before I moved the $.ajax() into the $.when(), they erred, in the $.when() they just result in undefined.
[12:31:12] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt yeah, this isn't structured properl;y.  that .then logic shouldn't be where it is.
[12:31:13] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:31:21] <tsukasadt> How would you suggest handling it? I need to be able to work with the responseHeaders and combine multiple responses into a single result.
[12:31:58] <robertmaxrees> also this is only working against one ajax call.
[12:31:59] <robertmaxrees> not many.
[12:32:15] <tsukasadt> One call at a time.
[12:32:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't need .when for that.
[12:33:47] <robertmaxrees> also your function call seems off.
[12:33:55] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm.
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> ignore that.
[12:35:17] <tsukasadt> So, how would I rewrite the call so as not to lose the functionality?
[12:35:23] <robertmaxrees> doing that now.
[12:35:24] <robertmaxrees> oine sec.
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> gonna point you int he right direction.
[12:37:32] <robertmaxrees> not functional, but you get the idea: https://bpaste.net/show/ae5a5ef84aec
[12:39:05] <tsukasadt> I'll have to make it a double function, this way, but I'll give it a shot.
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> double function?
[12:39:30] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean define multiple functions?
[12:40:08] <tsukasadt> The callAPI is supposed to encompass all of that, so one function that calls another with the intent of completely a single process.
[12:40:30] <robertmaxrees> breaking down into smaller functions is actually a better way to do that.
[12:40:40] <robertmaxrees> another way to do it is to pass in a callback instead.
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> but async: false; is a bad bad idea.
[12:46:55] <tsukasadt> robertmaxress, I did the setup like you suggested, but there's no change in the full script. May I PM you?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> why PM me?
[12:47:30] <tsukasadt> I was gonna send you the full script, but trying not to make it public.
[12:47:43] <robertmaxrees> i could have my logs publicly available ;)
[12:47:54] <tsukasadt> It might be something else able my script messing it up that you may catch. ^^'
[12:48:04] <tsukasadt> Oh.
[12:48:11] <robertmaxrees> lol people do stuff like that sometimes.
[12:48:25] <robertmaxrees> either way, why not make a test case?>
[12:48:31] <tsukasadt> I'm used to PMs remaining private. :S
[12:48:33] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle can mock your ajax calls.
[12:54:47] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, Here's the problem: https://thepasteb.in/p/wjhzcK7Lnv09Du6 That's the exact formatting of these functions in my full script, but isolated like that, they are working. In the fully script, they're failing.
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:55:35] <robertmaxrees> you already shared that.
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> sooo not sure what you're expecting.
[12:56:19] <tsukasadt> That's not what I shared, I had originally shared an edited version when the functions are loaded normally.
[12:56:27] <robertmaxrees> very similar.
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> either way, you're showing me the iteration that works.
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> not the iteration that breaks.
[12:56:45] <tsukasadt> It's the same bulk, but different function configuration.
[12:57:02] <tsukasadt> That's the thing, this code is the exact same in the full code that I can't make public.
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about why you can't make the broken version public.
[12:57:23] <tsukasadt> Literally a copy & paste.
[12:58:00] <tsukasadt> Because this is one part of a much larger script that higher ups say are not to be released publically.
[12:58:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> not sure how i can help, then.
[12:58:19] <robertmaxrees> since i can't see it break.
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> and i can't see the broken code.
[12:58:57] <tsukasadt> Well, that's why I wanted to do a private chat, but I guess I'll have to seek help elsewhere, then.
[12:59:02] <tsukasadt> Thank you for trying.
[12:59:07] <taplar> fixingthesejquery.com then?
[12:59:07] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can PM me if you really want.
[12:59:13] <robertmaxrees> oooh good call.
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> crack open a debugger and go to down.
[12:59:54] <robertmaxrees> *town
[13:00:29] <tsukasadt> I have, there are no errs reported beyond the triggering of the fail().
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> not the console.
[13:00:42] <robertmaxrees> the debugger.
[13:00:50] <tsukasadt> I know the difference...
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> then why mention that there were no errors reported? heh
[13:02:03] <tsukasadt> As in "there's nothing wrong with the debugger data that I found".
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:03:06] <taplar> what is the ajax response code/
[13:03:08] <taplar> ?
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> 200 apparently.
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> but i'm wondering if the actual data is any good.
[13:05:01] <taplar> did you put a breakpoint on ln 29 and step over each line?
[13:05:20] <tsukasadt> This is the responseText: https://thepasteb.in/p/KOhvcAgV5njglIo
[13:05:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:05:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid data.
[13:05:53] <tsukasadt> Seems to work just fine.
[13:05:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> while(1); can't have that in there.
[13:06:29] <tsukasadt> Do just the AJAX call for a single page and it formats into an array of objects, exactly as expected.
[13:06:46] <robertmaxrees> is that not what this is?
[13:07:17] <taplar> is the content type on the response 'application/json'?
[13:07:39] <tsukasadt> No, my code recursively does AJAX calls until the headers say there's no more data then combines them all into one response.
[13:08:05] * taplar knocks on his mic
[13:08:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:08:54] <tsukasadt> taplar, the type is reported as xhr while the response header says "application/json; charset=utf-8"
[13:09:07] <taplar> ok, so jquery will try to parse it as json
[13:09:19] <taplar> but if you have that while(1); in there it is invalid like robert said
[13:09:24] <taplar> which will throw the error and go to fail
[13:09:43] <tsukasadt> Which is exactly what it is, and single calls it works fine, it's that I need to combine multiple results into one that makes this so complex.
[13:10:09] <robertmaxrees> it's not really that complex tbh.  pretty trivial to properly structure this so that part works.
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt https://bpaste.net/show/88262ec555f9
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea.
[13:16:58] <tsukasadt> I'll give it a try, robertmaxrees. I'll need to make it more adaptive, since the number of calls will vary based upon the number of pages.
[13:17:12] <robertmaxrees> ....
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what this does though.
[13:18:07] <tsukasadt> Then I'm probably misreading it.
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> so you have an array of the options you need for each call.
[13:18:55] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/37e13a3fb5d9 forgot a return.
[13:19:04] <robertmaxrees> then you .map() over those calls and return the ajax deferreds for them.
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> then you use $.when() to wait for them all to finish.
[13:21:37] <tsukasadt> I guess I'm not understanding that mapping. How is it building the appropriate URL?
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> that's what you'd figure out.
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> but url and data work together for that
[13:24:57] <robertmaxrees> could cram it all into the url if you really wanted - data just does that part for you.
[13:26:11] <tsukasadt> Problem is that I don't get the page count until after the first call.
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> so you need to have at least one finish before you can do the rest?
[13:27:11] <tsukasadt> Yeah, the "last page" is pulled from the response header.
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> then you do one and smack the rest into the .then() of that first one.
[13:27:39] <tsukasadt> I've no other way to get the information.
[13:28:04] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - still giving you a solution to it ;)
[13:28:16] <robertmaxrees> btw, why is this being built out via a userscript?
[13:29:23] <tsukasadt> To provide expanded functionality only to users with the authorization to access it.
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a really odd way to do that.
[13:30:04] <tsukasadt> When the only customization we can do is via JavaScript, not really.
[13:30:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't have server-side access?
[13:31:24] <tsukasadt> It's a third-party host that only offers JavaScript/CSS editing, but the identification options made available are not thorough. Anyone given permissions outside a course return as an admin, even if they aren't. So the userscript is the only option for limiting who can use the added features.
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[13:32:29] <tsukasadt> They don't get admin rights, it just what were able to detect about their roles without API calls that most would not have access to make.
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> still a pretty limiting platform.
[13:33:52] <tsukasadt> I agree. Spoke out against getting it, that it tied our hands, but they don't listen to me until they need me to make something work.
[13:34:00] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[13:34:17] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can do that initial ajax call, get your data, and then do everything else after the fact.
[13:34:54] <tsukasadt> I'll give it a try, but I still don't understand the .map(), even after reading the documentation. xD
[13:35:08] <robertmaxrees> it takes data in one format and puts it in another.
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you're putting in an array of options and returning an array of deferreds.
[13:48:34] <RandomNoob> Hello guys. Please give me right direction. I created function where I send Ajax request. My final goal is to return Ajax response to variable. This is what I am doing now. https://gist.github.com/FZX/5d73b6ae18d852d76ddbfb27bfd90b08 also found in Google lots of answers but nothing is working for me.
[13:49:12] <robertmaxrees> RandomNoob you can't do that.
[13:49:15] <robertmaxrees> ajax is async.
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> anythign that relies on that data needs to be in that callback.
[14:01:48] <Ice_Strike2> How to get currrent selector name?
[14:03:08] <robertmaxrees> don't you already have it?
[14:04:18] <Ice_Strike2> Example
[14:04:20] <Ice_Strike2>  $(".input1,  .input2, .input3").on("change keyup paste", function() { })
[14:04:30] <Ice_Strike2> I need to know which selector got hit
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).hasClass('.input1'))
[14:05:04] <taplar> no period though iirc
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah my bad.
[14:16:47] <bjsnider> is there a way to do what this does: http://jsfiddle.net/popnoodles/uvVW4/1/
[14:17:10] <bjsnider> if the names and/or ids have variable names?
[14:17:25] <bjsnider> just increment the number part of the name
[14:18:02] <uskerine> hi, does anyone know how to know if all fields of a bootstrap form that uses bootstrap validator are validated or not? (i.e. if the form is validated or not)
[14:22:23] <robertmaxrees> which plugin?
[14:22:37] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing how to work this .map() out. :S
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider huh?
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> "if the names and/oir ids have variable names"?
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt where are you getting lost?
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt also, you're reading the docs on MDN, right?
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> and not the jquery one.
[14:23:55] <tsukasadt> Only the jQuery docs. I'll check MDN.
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt yeah, that .map() is the native JS one.
[14:24:27] <bjsnider> line 5 presupposes the name/id is fixed. i am wondering about doing this to a larger form with variable names and/or ids, or, if you like, attributes in general, all of which have this in common: [0]
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider this sounds really XYish to me.
[14:25:08] <bjsnider> that went over my head
[14:25:35] <tsukasadt> And I just lost everything to a browser crash...
[14:25:37] <robertmaxrees> you have problem x, and you think y is the right way to solve it but y seems kind of strange.  tell us about x.
[14:25:51] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider you mean you want to be able to clone the form and increment a number in a bunch of attributes?
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt what do you need then?
[14:25:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:26:33] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: precisely. i didn't want to waste your time since that code already does everything except accounting for somewhat unpredictable names
[14:26:58] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider heh, that's not wasting time.
[14:27:02] <robertmaxrees> but why do it that way at all?
[14:27:43] <uskerine> robertmaxrees bootstrap validator
[14:28:05] <uskerine> can I detect when a button becomes disabled or enabled?
[14:28:31] <robertmaxrees> uskerine link to docs?
[14:28:37] <uskerine> :(
[14:28:54] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: i found that code, and it mostly works, and i can't come up with anything better
[14:29:16] <bjsnider> if you have another idea, i am all ears, believe me
[14:29:32] <bjsnider> well, all eyes
[14:30:14] <robertmaxrees> uskerine.... ? how can I answer your question if I don't have the docs???
[14:30:24] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider why do you need IDs at all here?
[14:30:35] <robertmaxrees> and why have unique indices on the names in each separate form?
[14:30:37] <bjsnider> i don't
[14:30:54] <bjsnider> the names are much more important
[14:31:05] <robertmaxrees> but why do they need to be unique?
[14:31:33] <uskerine> robertmaxrees
[14:31:37] <uskerine> sorry I did not understand you
[14:31:44] <uskerine> https://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/
[14:31:57] <uskerine> but I think I just have to monitor the disabled/enabled status of the submit form of the button
[14:32:01] <uskerine> is that possible?
[14:32:11] <robertmaxrees> https://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/#validator-events
[14:32:20] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: the unique names have to do with the action code after submitting. it's going into a db, so i'm using the names to indentify the correct column in the db
[14:32:37] <uskerine> I have been there robertmaxrees, but as far as I understood those events are related to individual fields and not the whole form
[14:32:40] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider doing this via ajax or anything like that?
[14:33:31] <bjsnider> i think i'm planning to use html to handle the submission in this case
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> aaah.  'cause you could just do a hidden input field with that ID instead.
[14:35:15] <bjsnider> how would the action code know how to associate the names with each other?
[14:35:47] <robertmaxrees> oh these are all within one form?
[14:36:03] <bjsnider> yes
[14:36:46] <bjsnider> in other words, im agine you're submitting one group of fields, but you want to add many entries at once and you don't want to go through the process of reloading the form etc.
[14:36:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, funky.
[14:37:14] <bjsnider> you'd have a button which adds more copies of the submission fields
[14:37:23] <bjsnider> and i'd need to subtract them too i guess
[14:37:27] <bjsnider> but first things first
[14:38:50] <bjsnider> the clone method almost seems like it was created specifically for this
[14:39:51] <uskerine> robertmaxrees no tips on this?
[14:40:05] <robertmaxrees> uskerine i linked you to the part of the docs that tells you how.
[14:40:19] <uskerine> but those events are for individual fields, not for the whole form
[14:40:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:40:25] <robertmaxrees> so which is it?
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> you keep asking about the submit button
[14:40:50] <uskerine> my problem is that the button must be located outside the form
[14:41:00] <uskerine> so either I detect the validation of the whole form
[14:41:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> i love it when people magically change their problem description.
[14:41:14] <uskerine> or I clone the behaviour of a submit hidden button inside the form
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be outside?
[14:41:25] <uskerine> robertmaxrees, sorry it is hard to explain
[14:41:36] <uskerine> because I use two blocks
[14:41:52] <uskerine> one have a sign-in form (and you can't nest two forms apparently)
[14:42:00] <uskerine> and the checkout form
[14:42:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:42:10] <uskerine> and another block just needs the pay button
[14:42:19] <robertmaxrees> so then two forms...?
[14:42:21] <uskerine> which shall be enabled only when everything is ok
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> don't watch the button - explicitly trigger it in your logic.
[14:43:27] <uskerine> https://snag.gy/UrFu3i.jpg
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:43:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:43:49] <robertmaxrees> need to build out better js.
[14:44:11] <uskerine> how do I trigger it in my logic?
[14:44:22] <robertmaxrees> it's a prop.
[14:44:27] <robertmaxrees> add/remove it.
[14:44:55] <uskerine> but the button enable/disable logic is embbeded in the plugin
[14:45:11] <robertmaxrees> then use the event >.>
[14:46:12] <uskerine> https://snag.gy/vJkxbA.jpg
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:46:38] <uskerine> but the event is just "per field", not "per form"
[14:47:18] <robertmaxrees> did you read through the docs?
[14:47:21] <uskerine> https://snag.gy/dIekvB.jpg
[14:47:26] <uskerine> yes I did
[14:47:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:47:45] <uskerine> robertmaxrees I am not proficient in jQuery
[14:48:05] <robertmaxrees> the docs still tell you how to do what you want.
[14:48:10] <robertmaxrees> in the section i linked.
[14:48:45] <uskerine> ok I will reread
[14:48:53] <robertmaxrees> "Conditionally handling the submit event"
[14:48:57] <robertmaxrees> read that part.
[14:50:11] <uskerine> well I can use that, but if I understand it right, that happens when user submits
[14:50:17] <uskerine> the form
[14:50:38] <robertmaxrees> alright, i'm not sure what you're asking.  make a fiddle or something at this point.
[14:51:52] <uskerine> I will use that part, it is not exactly the behaviour I was looking for but it will allow me to launch a modal window asking the user to check all fields
[14:55:09] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt you still around?
[14:55:12] <robertmaxrees> got an example for you.
[15:02:50] <Es0teric> question does anyone know why this would return undefined? fav_count = jq(this).closest().find('#fav_count').html(); ? its within a <span id="fav_count">{num}</span>
[15:03:33] <taplar> why not just $('#fav_count') ?
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:04:32] <RandomNoob>  robertmaxrees: please help me find working callback example.
[15:04:40] <robertmaxrees> RandomNoob hrm?
[15:04:45] <robertmaxrees> link to your code?
[15:05:39] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy thing to do.
[15:05:48] <Es0teric|Work> taplar because its in a click event
[15:06:04] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric|Work do you have multiple #fav_count on the same page?
[15:06:09] <Es0teric|Work> yes
[15:06:14] <Es0teric|Work> ohhh it should be a class
[15:06:17] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:06:27] <robertmaxrees> also: jq(this).closest().
[15:06:27] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:06:36] <Es0teric|Work> its wrapped in a container
[15:06:38] <robertmaxrees> .closest() needs a selector.
[15:06:43] <Es0teric|Work> oh
[15:07:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean .parent()?
[15:07:58] <Es0teric|Work> robertmaxrees probably..
[15:08:03] <Es0teric|Work> but i did use .parent() already
[15:08:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:08:15] <Caspan> Okay so here is a tricky one i am adding a class of .selected to TR when i click on them to show that they are selected in my app.
[15:08:35] <Caspan> When i click on a row i want to make sure i remove the .selected from anyother table but this one
[15:08:49] <robertmaxrees> $('table .selected').removeClass('selected')
[15:08:58] <robertmaxrees> or whatever the parent should be.
[15:09:10] <Caspan> but hat wil alos remove the class from the current table
[15:09:20] <Caspan> i want to remove it from all other tables but this one
[15:09:29] <robertmaxrees> are you adding it to the current one?
[15:09:37] <Caspan> so that if there are any selected rows in a notehr table they are automaticly removed
[15:09:41] <Caspan> yes
[15:09:56] <Caspan> i have 4 tables
[15:09:58] <robertmaxrees> then use .not()
[15:10:13] <robertmaxrees> $('table').not($(this).closest('table'))
[15:10:15] <Caspan> i only want the user to select items from the same table and if they go to another table they loose their selection in the other table
[15:10:25] <Caspan> ohh .not
[15:16:55] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: https://3bit.io/f3kwt
[15:17:01] <Caspan> that is what i have now
[15:17:24] <Caspan> when i click on the income table it removes all the selected rows from these other tables that have those classes
[15:17:56] <Caspan> How would i change that to say remove the .selected class from ever table but this table
[15:18:28] <Caspan> I could jsut remove all .selected classes but hten i woudl remove it also from the row i just added the class to
[15:19:00] <Caspan> so i basically want to remove .selected form the whole DOM except the table i just clicked in
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[15:20:11] <Caspan> humm ill try
[15:20:12] <robertmaxrees> and actually.
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> you didn't do what I suggested here.
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> where's your .not() ?
[15:20:44] <Caspan> not($(this).closest('table')
[15:20:54] <Caspan> ohh that will take this table you clicked on
[15:20:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that in the code you shared.
[15:21:07] <Caspan> sorry i miss read your code
[15:21:53] <Es0teric|Work> this shit is driving me insane
[15:22:35] <Es0teric|Work> how is it that i am doing jq(this).find('.fav_count'); it returns the selector but if i do the same thing and add .html() or .text(); it returns either blank or undefined
[15:22:42] <Es0teric|Work> when theres clearly text in the div
[15:22:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta show us
[15:22:58] <Es0teric|Work> its a really big file, robertmaxrees
[15:23:06] <Es0teric|Work> i cant copy and paste everything
[15:23:11] <taplar> is the find() returning multiple elements?
[15:23:12] <robertmaxrees> your question pertains to one line of js and some minimal html.
[15:23:37] <Es0teric|Work> taplar im going to show you what it returns
[15:23:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:24:12] <taplar> i think there needs to be some lable for these responses, like we have x/y for questions
[15:24:14] <Es0teric|Work> buddypress.js?ver=2.8.1:343 [selector: ".fav_count", prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1], context: document]
[15:24:23] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell us anything duder.
[15:24:28] <robertmaxrees> make a reduced test case.
[15:24:34] <robertmaxrees> so we can see it in action.
[15:24:56] <Es0teric|Work> how can i make a reduced test case
[15:25:05] <Es0teric|Work> when idk whats making it behave the way its behaving now?
[15:25:08] <taplar> that is interesting though that it says the context is document
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric|Work you have a selector right?
[15:25:26] <Es0teric|Work> yeah
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees> in what, an event handlker?
[15:25:31] <Es0teric|Work> on click
[15:25:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, and some html that applies to?
[15:25:49] <Es0teric|Work> this is within a .post()
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter
[15:26:02] <robertmaxrees> just need the relevant markup and the few lines of JS.
[15:26:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't need everything else.
[15:27:35] <Es0teric|Work> basically im trying to grab the current click which is the anchor then manipulate the span content (because its taking a count and since i am favoriting something i want the count to go +1 or -1 depending if its been unfavorited or favorited
[15:27:36] <Es0teric|Work> very simple
[15:27:56] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what your markup structure is, if it's valid what the actual code is, etc...
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> and, if you don't know why it's broken, why should I trust your description of what's going on?
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:28:14] <Es0teric|Work> robertmaxrees i am going to show you what i have
[15:28:21] <Es0teric|Work> but dont say i didnt warn you
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> stellar.
[15:28:24] <robertmaxrees> dude
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> don't share the whole thing.
[15:28:38] <robertmaxrees> just make a test case!  it's easy :)
[15:29:03] <taplar> what's the inverse of rubber duck coding...
[15:29:06] <Es0teric|Work> im not copying everything
[15:29:06] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[15:29:15] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric|Work then why the warning? O.o
[15:29:20] <Es0teric|Work> you'll see
[15:29:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:31:14] <Es0teric|Work> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/5w9Lrh54/
[15:31:28] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[15:31:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:31:29] <Es0teric|Work> you're looking for line 38 in the js
[15:31:37] <robertmaxrees> what does the rest of this code have to do with it?
[15:31:54] <Es0teric|Work> i pasted the affected div and the js
[15:31:59] <Es0teric|Work> thats what you asked for
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:32:31] <taplar> yeah, 'this' in that success method is most likely not what you think it is
[15:32:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:33:04] <Es0teric|Work> how isnt it?
[15:33:09] <robertmaxrees> it referse to $.ajax
[15:33:12] <Es0teric|Work> i also tried using target
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> since that's the calling function.
[15:33:19] <Es0teric|Work> but its not what im looking for either
[15:33:39] <taplar> try storing 'this' in a variable before you call the ajax, and use that variable later
[15:33:40] <robertmaxrees> can stick .bind(this) onto that callback.
[15:33:44] <taplar> or that
[15:33:47] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:33:51] <Es0teric|Work> wait wait what?
[15:34:04] <robertmaxrees> where di dwe lose you?
[15:34:23] <Es0teric|Work> [03:33 PM] •  « robertmaxrees »	can stick .bind(this) onto that callback. <-- there
[15:34:37] <robertmaxrees> function() {}.bind(this)
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> also: could use event.currentTarget()
[15:34:54] <robertmaxrees> err,. event.currentTarget
[15:34:58] <Es0teric|Work> wait
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> since event.target isn't usually what you think it is.
[15:35:08] <Es0teric|Work> doesnt target refer to the click?
[15:35:22] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> it's the element that initiated the event,.
[15:35:44] <Es0teric|Work> so how do i get to the .fav_count
[15:35:49] <robertmaxrees> currentTarget is the current element within the bubbling phase.
[15:35:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[15:35:56] <robertmaxrees> which is usually === this
[15:36:01] <Es0teric|Work> hmm
[15:36:56] <robertmaxrees> so you have: bind the function, save 'this' to a var and use that var instead, use event.currentTarget.
[15:38:08] <robertmaxrees> bbaib
[15:41:18] <Es0teric|Work> wow that was painful
[15:41:26] <Es0teric|Work> i had to do something like var that = $(this)l;
[15:42:51] <Es0teric|Work> but now i have another problem
[15:43:08] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, Sorry, I was redoing what I'd done after I'd lost it and got called into an unplanned meeting. Here's what I've got: https://thepasteb.in/p/y8hzcRXzXwg0Ji2
[15:43:25] <Es0teric|Work> for some reason, on click each element is getting a 1 added to it instead of affecting the div in the current click
[15:44:17] <tsukasadt> Simply put, my problem is with the $.when() for processing the bulk of the calls. I've no idea what to do with the example you gave me. :S
[16:19:27] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I didn't notice you were away. Sorry, I was redoing what I'd done after I'd lost it and got called into an unplanned meeting. Here's what I've got: https://thepasteb.in/p/y8hzcRXzXwg0Ji2 Simply put, my problem is with the $.when() for processing the bulk of the calls. I've no idea what to do with the example you gave me. :S
[16:19:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nbdthLoq/1/
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> this should make a little more sense.
[16:29:13] <tsukasadt> Yes, that does. I think I got it, except it seems the return function doesn't wait. Even moving the returns within the $.when.then() doesn't seem to help.
[16:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't return out of those.
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> this keeps you from using async.
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> so you'll still have to make that initial call and then do this in the callback.
[16:34:46] <tsukasadt> I don't understand. The whole issue is that I need to wait for the calls to finish before the script does anything else and return the results for use, that's why I had it configured that way before. You said doing it this way would still do that, or am misunderstanding?
[16:35:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> earlier you said you needed to just wait for that first call to finish.
[16:35:16] <robertmaxrees> now you're saying it's all of them?
[16:35:26] <robertmaxrees> why does the entire page need to stop for some ajax calls?
[16:35:37] <tsukasadt> No, I always needed to wait for all of them. That way I get the combined results of all calls.
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> this gives you that.
[16:35:58] <robertmaxrees> that's what the $.when.apply does.
[16:36:21] <tsukasadt> Except the script continues with a blank array of results because it continues processing before the AJAX can run.
[16:36:37] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to call your other logic in that callback.
[16:36:40] <robertmaxrees> you need to refactor.
[16:36:51] <tsukasadt> So, the next step which requires the compiled array executes with an empty array.
[16:37:02] <robertmaxrees> instead you call that in the .then()
[16:37:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nbdthLoq/1/
[16:37:53] <tsukasadt> So I need to move all my follow-up lines inside that one, which will also requiring transferring a lot more variables.
[16:38:00] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:38:07] <robertmaxrees> you can wrap your other code in a function and then call it.
[16:38:54] <robertmaxrees> or move it.  but this way you're not freezing the page.
[16:38:56] <tsukasadt> Yes, and I have to get all these other variables defined earlier in the function triggering the callAPI function to go into this success function.
[16:39:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.  but that's a bit clearner of a scructure.
[16:39:45] <tsukasadt> The page is supposed to freeze. The user clicks a button and it processes the required data to gerenate a modal. This is just retrieving data to compile a component of that.
[16:40:05] <robertmaxrees> O.o so you actually want the page to stop fully doing anything and lock the browser?
[16:40:32] * taplar queues Boyz 2 Men to get back into the 90' mind set
[16:40:37] <tsukasadt> Yes. It takes all of a second to process 10 API calls.
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry, this is just so backwards from pretty much every other project i've ever seen.
[16:41:26] <tsukasadt> I understand and agree, but how else am I going to dynamically generate a component of something being created when the creation is triggered?
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> with what i'm showing you.
[16:41:52] <robertmaxrees> there's a basic bit here i feel like you aren't grokking.
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> you can do exactly that without locking the browser.
[16:42:29] <tsukasadt> Yes, at the cost of rewriting half my script.
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to rewrite it.  just refactor.
[16:42:50] <taplar> lol, user experience is an important thing man
[16:44:11] <tsukasadt> taplar, the user experience shouldn't change at all. Whether I refactor the script of go back to my original attempts, the user clicks the button and waits for the API calls to finish before the modal is loaded and they do anything else.
[16:44:11] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're just sort of arguing against our suggestions at this point for the sake of arguing them.
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> and you can still have that happen.
[16:44:27] <taplar> locking the browser is always bad user experience
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:44:35] <robertmaxrees> this is a good thing to avoid.
[16:44:53] <tsukasadt> taplar, I don't disagree, but there's nothing for them to do in the browser until it finishes the API calls.
[16:45:06] <taplar> what if they have other tabs open?
[16:45:32] <tsukasadt> My tabs don't freeze up when one tab does.
[16:45:49] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt to at this point really it's just that you don't want to refactor.
[16:46:37] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I'm not seeing what the difference would be. The rest of the code would not be processed until after the API calls finish, causing the same effect.
[16:46:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:46:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't lock the browser with my version.
[16:47:23] <robertmaxrees> but that's apparently not a good enough reason sooooo (shrug)
[16:48:06] <tsukasadt> It is a good reason, I just don't understand how there's any difference. They, logically, do the exact same thing.
[16:48:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:48:17] <robertmaxrees> the end result is similar.
[16:48:36] <robertmaxrees> but in one you prevent the user from being able to use their browser at all.  in the other, you don't.
[16:48:49] <tsukasadt> How?
[16:48:59] <robertmaxrees> by not using async: false
[16:50:43] <tsukasadt> I could understand that if there were to be a hundred calls at once, but we've nothing that even hit 10. The difference is load strain it negligible.
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it can matter once that box starts getting hammered and responses start taking longer.
[16:51:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar and i aren't suggesting busywork for you fwiw.
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> it's a good habit to do these things.  it saves headaches down the road whjen the project grows and other things become involved.
[16:52:00] <tsukasadt> Okay, then how's about this, how would I integrate it into when there's only 1 call?
[16:52:14] <robertmaxrees> you feed it an array of one.
[16:52:31] <robertmaxrees> or treat that first call as a seaparate instance and call this for your followup ones.
[16:54:41] <tsukasadt> Okay, so I actually need 2 functions. 1 to save the returns to a global variable and a second to continue the script.
[16:55:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you saving them globally??
[16:55:42] <tsukasadt> How else am I to get the first and follow-up responses into the same compiled array?
[16:55:54] <tsukasadt> I need all results, not just one or all but the first.
[16:56:01] <robertmaxrees> that's why you call them explicitly.
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> and pass them in.
[16:57:39] <tsukasadt> I'm basically already doing that, but they're still separate results that can't be used together because they can't see eachother. I have to put the results global in order to do so.
[16:59:03] <tsukasadt> The first call runs and all follow-on results are ran after using it's response headers to determine all follow-up calls. But the results of the follow-ups are not able to touch the results of the first.
[17:00:04] <tsukasadt> That was what was easy to understand and work with in my original code. The results are always there and useable.
[17:00:36] <tsukasadt> I just didn't understand why it would work by itself and not in my full script.
[17:01:18] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:01:53] <robertmaxrees> relying on global vars and async: false leads to funky behaviors
[17:02:03] <tsukasadt> And it wasn't even that it didn't work in the full script. As I had originally noted, when I ran the script via console it worked, it was only as a userscript that it failed.
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> like I said, global vars and async: false can lead to strange stuff.
[17:02:44] <taplar> two anti-patterns
[17:02:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:02:55] <robertmaxrees> but hey, whatever works (shrug)
[17:02:56] <tsukasadt> That's fine, so how do I make the first AJAX results available to the followup results without a global variable?
[17:03:12] <renic> hello
[17:03:16] <robertmaxrees> i already explained heh
[17:03:22] <robertmaxrees> i feel like I'm repeating myself.
[17:04:51] <tsukasadt> I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be difficult, I just don't understand. The first calls' results are sitting in the first callAPI waiting to be joined by the followup results. If I need to instead push them into the call, how do I do that so that are available in teh $.when.apply().then()?
[17:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you pass them into the function that handles that.
[17:05:32] <robertmaxrees> the idea is that you write functions that handle discrete actions.
[17:05:39] <robertmaxrees> functions are helpful for more than just reusable code.
[17:06:57] <bjsnider> i thought find was going to include everything as opposed to just the first of something
[17:07:10] <robertmaxrees> it does do everything.
[17:07:42] <tsukasadt> Alright, I think I know what you mean. I'll try what it is I think your saying.
[17:07:58] <tsukasadt> I am sorry, I really don't mean to be troublesome.
[17:08:11] <bjsnider> it's acting like children, i run it and children and they do the same thing
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.  i just feel like it was becoming really circuituitous
[17:08:28] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider then you only have one element that matches in that case.
[17:09:29] <bjsnider> i can reverse their order and it picks whicever one i put in the first spot
[17:09:41] <taplar> what's the selector?
[17:10:23] <robertmaxrees> just for the record: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/350fzf1g/
[17:10:43] <bjsnider> selector is input atm
[17:10:50] <bjsnider> did the same thing with option
[17:10:51] <taplar> 'input' ?
[17:10:58] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider look at that fiddle.
[17:11:03] <robertmaxrees> also: make sure your markup is valid.
[17:11:26] <renic> I've run into some very strange behavior in jquery 1.11.2 - I have an element that contains attribute like data-somestuff='{"jsonObject":"with keys and values","and":"more where \"quoted values are escape\""} ... the .data() function processes it as expected, until after this element is replaced via .empty().append(newContents) on its parent... so here's the thing... when I run .data() on the attribute after it has been replaced in the page, the json object
[17:11:26] <renic> gets interpretted as a string and doesn't get converted to an object.  this only happens when the attribute value has changed, but is reproducable even if the json strings are identical (change a to b, restart, change b to a.. two identical strings but one cannot be converted to object).  json passes jsonlint validation.  Not sure how to dig into this one.
[17:11:28] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:11:39] <robertmaxrees> renic make a fiddle.
[17:11:45] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that's a massive wall o'text.
[17:11:48] <renic> :)
[17:12:30] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I just threw in a modification for the carryover and it seems to be working with the merging. I'll work on a refactor in the morning. I need to get ready for a meeting in 15. Thank you for your patience. I really just didn't understand. :(
[17:12:41] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang.
[17:12:42] <renic> nature of this issue means it depends on changing backend responses.. not sure a fiddle will do the trick
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> renic you can mock those.
[17:13:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a reduced test case, not an entire app :)
[17:45:08] <renic> it's basically mangling the contents of the attribute: https://jsfiddle.net/gbeg73x6/
[17:46:12] <renic> may just have to store it encoded as something that will eliminate the need to escape characters.
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> iiiinteresting.
[17:49:48] <robertmaxrees> i might file a bug for this.
[17:51:13] <taplar> looks like it is doing it for most of the versions on fiddle
[17:51:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:51:23] <robertmaxrees> but this https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gbeg73x6/2/
[17:51:24] <robertmaxrees> works.
[17:51:29] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:51:31] <robertmaxrees> i think i see it.
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[17:52:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:53:14] <robertmaxrees> the easy fix here is to json.parse it.
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> but interesting it doesn't do that again for you.
[17:53:20] <renic> so easy answer is to use theChild.clone() instead of theParent.html()
[17:53:24] <taplar> document.querySelector('#wrapper').innerHTML prints the same thing
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[17:53:41] <renic> updated - https://jsfiddle.net/gbeg73x6/
[17:53:51] <renic> thanks guys.... saved me some headaches... :)
[17:53:58] <renic> will strick around to return the favor.
[17:54:09] <robertmaxrees> though I gotta ask...
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> why put templating data into a data attribute?
[17:54:40] <renic> because it comes from the server as a partial page replacement.
[17:54:50] <renic> and I want to reduce the number of calls
[17:55:02] <renic> could just get data, and rebuild...
[17:55:08] <renic> but then I have to write the server side twice.
[17:55:20] <renic> or always build it in browser.
[17:55:39] <renic> this lets me reuse code on the server side more efficiently with the framework in place.
[17:55:45] <robertmaxrees> lemme rephrase - why not store it somewhere else?
[17:56:43] <renic> because I haven't thought of a more appropriate place to store it. :)
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:56:59] <robertmaxrees> got some kind of view that initializes on this?
[17:57:44] <renic> yep.
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> why not store it on there somehow?
[17:58:29] <renic> extra code for no advantage.
[17:59:24] <renic> at least not one I see.
[17:59:36] <robertmaxrees> keep your templating data out of your markup.
[17:59:41] <robertmaxrees> avoid bugs like this one entirely.
[17:59:48] <robertmaxrees> but hey, no advantage ;)
[18:00:09] <renic> it's not for templating the page this stuff appears on.
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:00:26] <renic> it's for manipulating templated documents in a wysiwyg editor.
[18:00:53] <robertmaxrees> so it's still data.
[18:00:59] <renic> everything is data... :)
[18:01:06] <renic> but it's not technically templating data...
[18:01:08] <renic> it's app data.
[18:01:28] <renic> app data that happens to be templating data for other data.
[18:01:31] <renic> lol.
[18:01:36] <robertmaxrees> still data.
[18:01:38] <robertmaxrees> and markup is not data.
[18:01:43] <renic> markup is data.
[18:01:46] <robertmaxrees> NEWP.
[18:01:46] <renic> code is data.
[18:01:48] <robertmaxrees> *newp.
[18:01:52] <renic> everything is data.
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> but what do i know about anything.
[18:02:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry for trying to make your life easier ;)
[18:02:09] <renic> everything apparently. :)

[19:12:25] <jak2000> or check...
[19:12:26] <robertmaxrees> the TD or the Input?
[19:12:33] <jak2000> the Input.
[19:12:41] <robertmaxrees> so why are you going through the TDs?
[19:12:44] <robertmaxrees> also: wrong each :)

[19:13:17] <robertmaxrees> input
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> you also don't need each at all here.
[19:13:32] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to check or uncheck them all?
[19:13:43] <jak2000> mmmm uncheck
[19:13:47] <robertmaxrees> always uncheck?

[19:21:23] <robertmaxrees> there's a much cleaner way to do this: first you need to target the inputs, not the TD.  second, you need to not use $.each here.  in fact, you don't need any form of each
[19:21:29] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etmvL3gr/8/   <-- ok if user click on the checkbox, (first checkbox, column1,) and unchecked i want uncheck the others 2 checkboxes.... in this case: 2216.00 and 1239.00 how to?
[19:21:49] <robertmaxrees> you're still targeting the td.
[19:21:53] <robertmaxrees> you want the input.
[19:22:10] <jak2000> but need remove the .each?
[19:22:14] <robertmaxrees> you don';t need it.
[19:22:27] <robertmaxrees> .prop() as a setter does that part automatically.
[19:22:51] <robertmaxrees> here's the freebie.

[19:24:14] <jak2000> ok
[19:24:21] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome
[19:25:10] <jak2000> studying
[19:36:22] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: can you have a look on my issue?
[19:36:33] <robertmaxrees> there are over 450 people idling in here :)
[19:36:38] <robertmaxrees> just ask your questiomn.
[19:36:43] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[19:37:00] <Aljone> hey friends, i got some new wwebsite , some event change the width of an element, is there way to know what even cause that easily?
[19:37:07] <Aljone> but u're the pro here :)
[19:37:08] <Aljone> haha
[19:37:13] <robertmaxrees> nah, plenty of people are pros.
[19:37:15] <robertmaxrees> and that's pretty vague.
[19:37:17] <Aljone> my guru
[19:37:26] <Aljone> my master
[19:37:29] <robertmaxrees> when does the width change happen?
[19:37:40] <Aljone> when page loads but there are tons of js files there
[19:37:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd start commenting stuff out.
[19:38:02] <jak2000> how to alert an id? alert($(this).id());  this is wrong right?
[19:38:03] <Aljone> and i couldnt find the specific element on search , so i guess it could be like parent() or siblings ,or who knows
[19:38:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use alert jak2000
[19:38:13] <robertmaxrees> use console.
[19:38:15] <robertmaxrees> and it's a property.
[19:38:17] <robertmaxrees> toooo
[19:38:32] <robertmaxrees> *soooo
[19:44:56] <jak2000> <input type='checkbox' name='chk_1_3' class='xinput' id='chk_1_3' value='chk_1_3' checked />
[19:45:03] <jak2000> for get the id i try:
[19:45:32] <jak2000> $(document).on("change", ".myRowIdColumn .xinput", function () { console.log($(this).id); });  but say undefined why?
[19:48:05] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle yo.
[19:48:40] <robertmaxrees> actually i gotta jet.
[19:48:48] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com <- read this :)
[19:49:26] <jak2000> ok
[19:50:20] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/etmvL3gr/13/
[19:50:24] <jak2000> i am checking this
[19:51:21] <jak2000> DONE right?
[19:52:11] <uskerine> Did anyone use sandbox PayPal accounts?
[20:50:32] <SlizardWizard> Is there a way to figure out why $('form').submit() would fail?
[20:51:01] <SlizardWizard> I have an event listener that listen for the submit event and if certan conditions are met it prevents it from sending
[20:51:33] <SlizardWizard> but i put a console.log() in there and it seems like it should be sending perfectly fine
[22:01:28] * sportman is feeling dumb toda
[22:01:30] <sportman> today.
[22:01:59] <sportman> would a jQuery('.class').fadeOut(400); command perform poorly if there are say 500 elements with that class?
[22:02:19] <sportman> i was going to use it to show / hide pins on a map, each pin has classes by category names
[22:36:45] <renic> so I discovered the underlying issue with where things went bad earlier.... I forgot about json and escaped forward slashes.... mystery solved. https://jsfiddle.net/gbeg73x6/3/
[22:37:01] <renic> json allows it... jquery does not... woot...
