[06:01:11] <hollabackatcha> hi. i need to implement a location picker.. of sorts. basically you get a fancy looking world map, and you can pick and choose locations.. click on country,and pin appears.. and chosen. then i'll have a save button that will basically send country_id of a chosen country.
[06:02:03] <hollabackatcha> and recommendations on a library for this ? i did google, i found a bunch of results, but i would prefer somebodies experience
[06:03:03] <hollabackatcha> maybe mapael
[10:41:04] <quechon> i have different jquery script in my app that my brower shows with no problem but just now i created another script that my brower doesnt show in the inspect tool
[10:41:14] <quechon> why is that
[10:41:23] <quechon> i know the path is fine
[12:03:32] <sou2016> hi
[12:45:28] <hillct> How are slashs inepeed by jquery in selecors for example ‘#episodes/oceansmp4/clips/Fourth’ ?
[12:57:08] <GoSox> i have a radio button group with 9 options. Is there an easy way for me to count the totall number of 'checked' radios, so i can make sure exactly 1 is checked? Rather than goign through each radio input one by one?
[13:17:10] <shoky> $('.myradio:checked').length
[13:17:40] <shoky> but uh if they are radios then you don't need to make sure yourself.. radios make sure for you
[13:17:45] <shoky> if you give them all the same name
[13:17:50] <shoky> GoSox ^
[13:18:13] <GoSox> there can still be zero radios checked
[13:18:19] <GoSox> (if you give them the same name)
[13:18:56] <shoky> touche.
[13:19:04] <GoSox> :D
[13:19:18] <shoky> ;p
[13:21:41] <GoSox> new question, is tehre an easy way to restore an element to its css styling, before i started messing with it in javascript?
[13:23:36] <shoky> depends what kind of messing you did.. if you just used .css() and it had no inline styling to begin with... you could .removeAttr('style')  :\
[13:23:44] <shoky> otherwise.. not so easy
[13:24:26] <GoSox> ok, yeah i'm just trying to make a chain of shortcuts work instead of doing things the right way :D
[13:27:16] <shoky> you'll learn ;)
[13:27:18] <Joey__> you know those contact form sidebar things that stay in place to the left or right.... would it be possible to make one that is attached to the bottom of the bootstrap navbar at the page... but with a navbar that isn't fixed? so the "contact form sidebar" would scroll with the page, but when you click it to open it would open as overlay
[13:27:38] <Joey__> *at the top of the page*
[13:31:52] <Joey__> I guess it's basically an odd shaped navbar when you think about it
[13:41:05] <GoSox> i have a form I'm submitting, i stopped it with .preventDefault(), and i checked all the inputs. If everything passes, can I simply submit the form? without getting myself into an infinite loop of input checking?
[13:47:56] <shoky> GoSox: is the input checking asynchronous?  if not then you can just _not_ call .preventDefault() if all is valid
[13:48:12] <GoSox> hmmm
[13:48:19] <GoSox> yeah that makes sense doesn it
[13:48:31] <shoky> GoSox: otherwise if you still want to be doing things the wrong way.. you can call .submit() on the actual form element (not on the jquery object)
[13:48:38] <shoky> e.g.  $('#myform')[0].submit()
[13:49:04] <GoSox> no that makes sense, i can just hole the preventDefault till the end, and just skip it
[13:49:13] <GoSox> if the form passes, thats the easiest solution
[13:49:19] <shoky> yap
[13:50:04] <GoSox> now i feel dumb, i know that i have other forms on other sites where i call preventDefault first, then if the form passes, I manually do my own POST http request
[13:50:06] <GoSox> derp
[13:52:55] <starlays> hello to all, I need some help, I don't know why my code is not returning the clicked row index from the table. This is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/L1gnes9p/
[13:56:37] <pcfreak30> Does serialize() only work on inputs wrapped in a form?
[13:56:56] <GoSox> shoky: if i do the form submission that easy way, is there a way i can have some "on form submit completed" code?
[14:01:01] <shoky> GoSox: not sure what you mean.. ?
[14:01:50] <GoSox> i want data back from the submission, I guess i DO have to do my own http request to get that huh
[14:01:56] <shoky> pcfreak30: no
[14:02:31] <shoky> GoSox: you want the server response?  that will get rendered by the browser..
[14:02:37] <shoky> in a regular submit
[14:02:58] <GoSox> i haven't worked with jquery in like a year
[14:03:03] <GoSox> yeah thats not what i want at all
[14:03:43] <pcfreak30> shoky: odd as i have to use .closest('form').serialize to do it. Version 1.12.4
[14:03:45] <GoSox> that's why i preventDefault first, i need to make my own http request so i can process the results inline and not send the browser to a new page
[14:04:28] <shoky> pcfreak30: works fine donno https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/10/
[14:06:08] <shoky> GoSox: oks then you want an ajax request ya
[14:06:28] <GoSox> yeah
[14:06:44] <GoSox> theres only a shortcut for GET's right? i need the full ajax code for a POST?
[14:07:04] <shoky> there's $.post if that's what you mean
[14:07:04] <pcfreak30> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/pcfreak30/3cjs5hx7/11/
[14:10:58] <shoky> pcfreak30: you need to call it on the inputs  https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/12/
[14:11:08] <dan_j> Hi. Please can someone recommend a chart plugin which allows for a vertical barchart with multiple series and a tooltip which can be fixed to the top right of the chart? Similar to this example https://ibin.co/32f3O504bpC4.png
[14:11:39] <GoSox> shoky: what is the default timeout for a $.post request?
[14:11:56] <pcfreak30> shoky: whats input vs :input?
[14:12:30] <shoky> GoSox: there's no default timeout i think.. just the browser's own timeout on the request
[14:12:42] <shoky> pcfreak30:  :input also finds <select> and <textarea> etc
[14:14:20] <shoky> dan_j: highcharts can do that for sure
[14:14:48] <shoky> probably any other charts lib too, but i know highcharts can
[14:16:11] <dan_j> shoky: thanks. Bit pricey but will add it to my list if I cant find anything more suitable.
[17:46:17] <bobby_barker> when making an ajax call to a post in jquery how do i get the return value? I'm a little confused as I'm seeing more than one way and I'm also not getting the result (possibly because of the backend)
[17:47:30] <bobby_barker> I'm calling $.ajax({...}).done(...) to get the result
[17:56:51] <bobby_barker> anyone of the 478 people in here actually in here?
[17:57:18] <drej> nope
[17:59:05] <systemfault> bobby_barker: You don't "return" the result... your program resumes execution from the callback
[17:59:50] <bobby_barker> systemfault, but isn't the .done() function supposed to take the data returned?
[18:00:00] <bobby_barker> returned from the REST?
[18:00:29] <systemfault> doSomethingA() $.ajax({}).done(function(data) {}); doSomethingB(); doesn't work with async code, it must be replaced by doSomethingA() $.ajax({}).done(function(data) { doSomethingB();  });
[18:01:10] <systemfault> $.ajax(....).done(function(data) { here, data is the result returned by the server  });
[18:01:42] <bobby_barker> $.ajax(.....).done(function(data) { console.log(data); }); is what I'm doing
[18:01:50] <bobby_barker> that should work then on the jquery end right?
[18:02:10] <bobby_barker> I'm getting nothing logged even if i do console.log('whatever'); in its place instead
[18:02:27] <systemfault> Then add a fail handler, you might have a problem
[18:02:29] <bobby_barker> but on the backend I'm getting the request
[18:02:37] <bobby_barker> okay let me try that
[18:02:44] <systemfault> $.ajax(.....).done(function(data) { console.log(data); }).fail(function(error) { console.error(error); });
[18:08:09] <bobby_barker> systemfault, it gives me this "SyntaxError: Unexpected token r in JSON at position 0"
[18:08:39] <bobby_barker> says parse error and returns an object
[18:08:53] <bobby_barker> in the exact opposite order that I stated lol
[18:09:49] <systemfault> Then look at your dev tools, what you get from the server might not even be JSON
[18:11:50] <bobby_barker> systemfault, thank you i'll have a look at that. I think this should be plenty to get my error solved. thanks a bunch (:
[18:11:59] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[18:13:16] <bobby_barker> haha just got it thanks, systemfault (:
[18:13:20] <bobby_barker> silly error on the server-side
[18:13:24] <systemfault> Awesome!
[18:27:34] <sochi> I know this is the wrong channel, but does anybody here know why my overflow: hidden isn't working on my first-child? Nobody is responding on css :( https://codepen.io/Sochi/pen/LbWYYM?editors=1100#0
[19:05:44] <shoky> sochi: what do you mean it isn't working?  there isn't overflow: hidden on the first-child
[19:06:25] <shoky> and the overflow:hidden on the parent is working
[19:36:36] <sochi> shoky: I put oh on the first child, not on the parent. That's what I did wrong :)
[21:31:42] <rickygervais> hey guys
[21:31:56] <rickygervais> so i'm pretty much done with all my JS code all I need is help with one more last thing
[21:32:02] <rickygervais> please see: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[21:32:20] <rickygervais> I simple like to wrap those <p>'s in a <li>
[21:32:37] <rickygervais> u can see where I commented it
[21:32:54] <rickygervais> Utils: btw, here's my final code: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[21:33:08] <rickygervais> Utils: not sure if you're still around
[21:33:34] <rickygervais> it's completed i just need help wrapping then in one <ul> and multiple <li>'s

[21:39:23] <rickygervais> it looks like you're not loading jquery library
[21:41:20] <cumtjian> google in our country is forbidden
[21:41:42] <rickygervais> what country is this?
[21:41:52] <cumtjian> China
[21:42:35] <rickygervais> that sux
[21:42:59] <cumtjian> GreatWall maybe you know
[21:54:10] <rickygervais> trying to just loop this in a list items: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[21:54:15] <rickygervais> any suggestions guys
[22:03:08] <taplar> rickygervais: what exactly do you want in the li's ?
[22:04:00] <rickygervais> taplar: I simply want to wrap all those <p>'s in multiple <li>'s
[22:04:23] <taplar> each p in an li or each collection of p's per iteration in one li?
[22:04:24] <rickygervais> for example: <ul><li><p>content here<p> <p>content</p></li> <li>content here <p>content</p></li> </ul>
[22:04:40] <rickygervais> each collection of p's per iteration in one li
[22:05:00] <rickygervais> so one <ul> and collection of p's in one li
[22:05:13] <rickygervais> there should be in total 16 li's
[22:05:24] <rickygervais> in here : https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[22:05:34] <taplar> so, create your ul/ol outside of the iteration, create an li in the iteration, append all the things to the li, append the li at the end of each iteration, and then append the ul/ol after the each is done
[22:06:05] <rickygervais> that's the thing
[22:06:14] <rickygervais> I've gotten this far: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[22:06:28] <rickygervais> but not sure how to approach it in terms of code
[22:06:35] <taplar> right i don't see any logic in there about ul/ols or lis
[22:06:38] <taplar> what's confusing you?
[22:06:53] <rickygervais> what's confusing me.. is that I am not sure how to write that logic
[22:06:57] <rickygervais> i've got the loop correct
[22:07:05] <rickygervais> and the p's are all displaying fine
[22:07:18] <rickygervais> i just need to wrap then now.. I'm not sure how to do that
[22:07:40] <taplar> var somevariable = $('<sometag>');  somevariable.append('some other stuff');  ....   $(elementOnThePage).append(somevariable);
[22:08:10] <rickygervais> is it possible if you give me a starting point from that jsfiddle i sent?
[22:08:23] <taplar> ^ what is confusing about that?
[22:08:47] <taplar> create element, append to it, add it to the page
[22:08:52] <vitruxv> i was also a bit confused by the question
[22:09:06] <vitruxv> looking at your fiddle you seem to know how to do the logic
[22:09:21] <rickygervais> man it took me hours to get to this page
[22:09:34] <taplar> ya $(stuff).appendTo(selector) is the same as $(selector).append(stuff)
[22:09:35] <rickygervais> with the help of utils of course :)
[22:09:59] <rickygervais> but how would I close it properly to wrap in one li ?
[22:10:08] <taplar> where the you don't close it
[22:10:12] <taplar> sorry, run on
[22:10:18] <taplar> you don't close it, you are not creating html
[22:10:21] <taplar> you are creating dom elements
[22:10:44] <taplar> if you do $('<div>') that is creating a jQuery object with an Element represending a div node
[22:10:51] <taplar> you just then append to it
[22:11:06] <rickygervais> hmmmm
[22:11:11] <rickygervais> let me think
[22:11:23] <taplar> var $ol = $('<ol>'); $ol.append('<li>whatever</li>');
[22:11:43] <taplar> just like how you are already doing it
[22:11:50] <rickygervais> yea but
[22:11:54] <taplar> except you are creating the ol, not selecting an existing element on the page
[22:11:55] <rickygervais> like this here
[22:12:06] <rickygervais> $('<p>' + home + ' (' + homeRecord + ')' + ' vs ' + away + ' (' + awayRecord + ')' + '</p>').appendTo('#scoreboard');       $('<p>' + 'score: ' + homeScore + ' - ' + awayScore + '</p>').appendTo('#scoreboard');
[22:12:21] <rickygervais> those 2 p's... how would i append to one <li>
[22:12:22] <rickygervais> ?
[22:12:28] <taplar> you just do it
[22:12:51] <taplar> var $li = $('<li>'); $li.append('stuff1');  $li.append('stuff2'); ...
[22:14:16] <rickygervais> my thing is
[22:14:23] <rickygervais> what you're saying confuses me because
[22:14:32] <rickygervais> why should I append each time
[22:14:40] <taplar> ?
[22:14:54] <rickygervais> are you saying I have to write 16 appends?
[22:15:01] <rickygervais> manually?
[22:15:03] <vitruxv> no
[22:15:08] <vitruxv> you loop through them
[22:15:14] <taplar> i'm expressing the logic.  i'm not dictating what you use as the 'stuff'
[22:15:19] <taplar> that's up to you
[22:15:25] <taplar> it could be 100 different html tags
[22:16:18] <rickygervais> can u guys give a start point on the actual fiddle versus in the chat ?
[22:16:29] <rickygervais> on here: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/3/
[22:16:35] <taplar> already did
[22:16:40] <taplar> var $ol = $('<ol>'); $ol.append('<li>whatever</li>');
[22:16:58] <taplar> take that and see what you can come up with
[22:17:20] <rickygervais> ok
[22:19:21] <taplar> and also for reference: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/manipulating-elements/
[22:20:16] <rickygervais> alright trying it
[22:20:23] <rickygervais> thank you for the help so far
[22:23:06] <rickygervais> i got this so far: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/4/
[22:24:00] <taplar> first off you only wanted one ul, right?
[22:24:36] <rickygervais> yeah one <ul>
[22:25:11] <taplar> you are creating the ul inside the each right now
[22:25:51] <rickygervais> oh so are you saying it's better for me to just write out the <ul> in the html itself right
[22:25:53] <rickygervais> like this
[22:26:01] <taplar> no you don't have to
[22:26:08] <taplar> just create it -before- the each
[22:26:08] <rickygervais> https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/5/
[22:26:22] <taplar> but sure, that works too
[22:27:51] <rickygervais> ok so
[22:28:33] <rickygervais> the next step I would do
[22:28:36] <rickygervais> like this: $ul.each(games, function() {
[22:28:42] <taplar> ul is empty
[22:29:37] <taplar> what about this is confusing you?
[22:29:59] <rickygervais> the whole function
[22:30:03] <rickygervais> of this: $.each(games, function() {
[22:30:12] <taplar> that is looping over the games array
[22:30:14] <rickygervais> wouldn't it be wrapped in an li something like
[22:30:21] <rickygervais> $(li).each(games, function() {
[22:30:26] <taplar> there are no lis
[22:30:32] <taplar> you are creating lis
[22:30:38] <taplar> you can't loop over something that does not exist
[22:30:58] <rickygervais> this is the part that's confusing me
[22:31:00] <rickygervais> $ol.append('<li>whatever</li>');
[22:31:07] <rickygervais> what goes in "whatever"
[22:31:12] <taplar> literally...
[22:31:16] <rickygervais> i want the all my p's in there
[22:31:16] <taplar> lol
[22:31:21] <taplar> then do that
[22:31:22] <rickygervais> how would I write that out
[22:31:26] <taplar> you wouldn't
[22:31:40] <taplar> you'd create a $li element and then append your p's to that
[22:31:46] <taplar> which i stated before
[22:32:16] <taplar> (9:05:34 PM) taplar: so, create your ul/ol outside of the iteration, create an li in the iteration, append all the things to the li, append the li at the end of each iteration, and then append the ul/ol after the each is done
[22:33:51] <rickygervais> here's what I understand from what you said
[22:34:25] <rickygervais> create your ul/ol outside of the iteration = var $ul = $('<ul>');  $ul.append('<li></li>');
[22:34:58] <taplar> that statement does not say the second part
[22:35:13] <taplar> you create an li just like you create the ul
[22:35:19] <rickygervais> create an li in the iteration = var $li = $('<li>');    ?
[22:35:22] <taplar> yes
[22:35:30] <rickygervais> ok so I got 2 things so far
[22:35:45] <rickygervais> in the iteration means inside the loop, correct?
[22:35:47] <taplar> then append all your content to it.  either all at once or one at a time
[22:35:50] <taplar> yes
[22:36:04] <rickygervais> append all the things to the li
[22:36:08] <rickygervais> how would I do that?
[22:36:14] <taplar> $li.append(stuff)
[22:36:25] <rickygervais> so...
[22:36:29] <taplar> or $(stuff).appendTo($li)
[22:37:08] <rickygervais> i'm googling to figure out
[22:37:19] <taplar> read that page i linked man
[22:37:25] <rickygervais> i did
[22:37:28] <taplar> i'm telling you almost verbatim what you need
[22:38:13] <rickygervais> I wouldn't want to do for example: $( "li" ).append( $( "p" ) );
[22:38:26] <taplar> probably not
[22:38:30] <taplar> cause your content is not 'p'
[22:38:47] <rickygervais> I want all those p's appended to one li
[22:38:52] <taplar> so do it
[22:38:55] <taplar> lol
[22:38:55] <rickygervais> i'm looking at the link here you sent
[22:39:08] <taplar> $('<p>' + home + ' (' + homeRecord + ')' + ' vs ' + away + ' (' + awayRecord + ')' + '</p>').appendTo('#scoreboard');
[22:39:10] <rickygervais> and I don't see it
[22:39:15] <taplar> $('<p>' + home + ' (' + homeRecord + ')' + ' vs ' + away + ' (' + awayRecord + ')' + '</p>').appendTo($li);
[22:39:21] <taplar> what's hard about that?
[22:39:42] <rickygervais> Wow.
[22:40:50] <rickygervais> sorry I think I see what you're saying
[22:40:57] <rickygervais> let me try one sec
[22:51:09] <rickygervais> I've got this far: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/10/
[22:51:27] <rickygervais> I think it's close
[22:51:55] <taplar> ok, so you are creating a ul outside.  you are creating an li inside the each, and you are putting all the stuff on it
[22:52:19] <rickygervais> it's fine so far right?
[22:52:32] <taplar> yep, though you have that extra empty li your making up top
[22:52:59] <taplar> but whatevs, :)
[22:53:04] <rickygervais> this? $ul.append('<li></li>');
[22:53:08] <taplar> yep
[22:53:35] <rickygervais> ok it's gone: https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/11/
[22:53:42] <rickygervais> now how would I generate it now?
[22:53:49] <taplar> generate what?
[22:53:51] <rickygervais> so it can't print out the html
[22:54:11] <rickygervais> oh... wait
[22:54:20] <taplar> :|
[22:54:55] <rickygervais> let me try one thing
[22:56:44] <rickygervais> https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/12/
[22:56:46] <rickygervais> it's close :)
[22:56:50] <rickygervais> but where's my UL?
[22:57:10] <taplar> why did you append it to scoreboard?
[22:57:56] <rickygervais> it should be: $($li).appendTo($ul); ?
[22:58:07] <taplar> don't wrap the $li, and yes
[22:58:18] <taplar> $li is already a jquery object
[23:00:19] <rickygervais> Yay! https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/14/
[23:00:31] <rickygervais> let me know if all is good there ;)
[23:00:38] <taplar> close
[23:00:49] <taplar> you are appending your ul to scoreboard inside the each
[23:00:53] <taplar> do that after the each
[23:01:17] <taplar> and one more thing
[23:01:20] <rickygervais> oh..
[23:01:40] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[23:02:03] <taplar> read the documentation for each().  it gives you atleast two parameters, index and variable
[23:02:29] <taplar> you can use index instead of keeping track of your own 'i' and variable is already passed in so you don't have to do games[i]
[23:03:40] <taplar> but at least now you understand the element creation a bit more?
[23:04:07] <Boobie> is there a channel for web app dev?
[23:04:17] <rickygervais> yea I do.. is fine now? https://jsfiddle.net/L5LLwdw8/15/
[23:04:18] <taplar> i think there is a #web or ##web
[23:05:06] <taplar> rickygervais: that works.  still, take a look at what i mentioned about the usage of each() to reduce your code
[23:05:12] <Boobie> taplar, they don't really discuss platform or toolkits there
[23:05:26] <taplar> then maybe try #freenode
[23:05:46] <rickygervais> taplar: ok
[23:06:24] <taplar> and with that, i'm off to watch more netflix, ^_^
[23:06:57] <taplar> l8r all
[23:06:58] <rickygervais> taplar: thank you very much for all your help
[23:07:02] <taplar> np man
