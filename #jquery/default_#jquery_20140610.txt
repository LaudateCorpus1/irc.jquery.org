[00:00:06] <Cork> and as this apparently is meant to be a function you might want to add that part in
[00:06:24] <dave_2> uploaded here this will do ? http://technocia.com/map_api/3/
[00:09:35] <Cork> dave_2: you could implement this in a much less cody fashion
[00:10:29] <dave_2> Cork i would love to do that, i'm just new and learning things up
[00:11:05] <Cork> dave_2: you could move the option specific values into data-<key>="<value>" attributes
[00:11:15] <Cork> and have the selected option just control it
[00:11:27] <Cork> that should remove about 70% of your logic need
[00:12:00] <Cork> secondly you should be careful to DEFINE YOUR VARIABLES!
[00:12:12] <Cork> it is really bad to have all variables you ever create as globals
[00:13:42] <Cork> after moving the values to the data- you could change it to: var selectedCar = $('.vehicle_table tr.ui-selected');
[00:14:19] <dave_2> can you give me an example with data attribute?
[00:14:19] <Cork> and selected.data('rate') for example would be the rate for that type
[00:15:36] <Cork> <tr data-type="normalcar" data-rate="1.6">
[00:15:38] <Cork> for example
[00:16:55] <Cork> or if you want to have the ranges for the types do
[00:17:31] <Cork> <tr data-type="normalcar" data-rate="[1.6,1.2,1,1.1,1.05,1,0.95]">
[00:17:33] <Cork> opps
[00:17:38] <Cork> <tr data-type="normalcar" data-rates="[1.6,1.2,1,1.1,1.05,1,0.95]">
[00:20:24] <dave_2> and then how do i do those calculation then? calculating price based on miles and those things, if i wanted to fix what i've for now , how do proceed?
[00:28:16] <Cork> davearel: var input = 160; var categories = [0, 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150]; for(var i = 0;i < categories.length && categories[i] < input && categories[i+1] < input; i++) {};
[00:28:17] <Cork> opps
[00:28:27] <Cork> ah... he left -_-'
[00:33:01] <naeluh> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmgsYPJSTDw
[00:38:12] <dddh> I want to reload some data from server every minute and change some classes on my page
[00:38:31] <dddh> setTimeout?
[00:49:50] <naeluh> dddh: without node.js your best bet is requestAnimationFrame http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/
[00:50:09] <naeluh> what are your doing ?
[00:50:26] <naeluh> reload data with what ?
[00:50:31] <naeluh> do you have code?
[00:50:53] <naeluh> !g jsfiddle
[00:50:54] <b-ot> naeluh: JSFiddle: Create a new fiddle → http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:52:53] <Cork> uh... make network calls from requestAnimationFrame????
[00:53:29] <Cork> dddh: you might want to look into websocket and push changes when something change instead of constantly pulling
[00:53:55] <naeluh> haha right it would be awesome !
[00:54:44] <naeluh> what about http://socket.io/
[00:55:19] <Cork> its a comet implementation
[00:55:50] <Cork> it does similar things to websocket but through a constant stream of ajax calls
[00:58:17] <dddh> naeluh: I want to know if devices are online
[00:58:38] <naeluh> but for this implmetation !g update data every mintue js
[00:58:43] <dddh> Cork: I'll try
[00:58:44] <naeluh> !g update data every mintue js
[00:58:46] <b-ot> naeluh: javascript - Suggest a way to update time every minute - Stack ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8848389/suggest-a-way-to-update-time-every-minute
[00:59:14] <naeluh> if they are on your site they are online
[00:59:30] <Cork> naeluh: i think he means a device on the server
[00:59:34] <Cork> not the actual server...
[00:59:53] <dddh> I mean if sip phones are registered at PBX
[01:00:00] * Cork nods
[01:00:24] <Cork> dddh: if you can get notified when those are registered then websocket is sweet
[01:00:48] <Cork> if you need to check, then ya websocket or just a puller works
[01:00:49] <dddh> Cork: I can query PBX db
[01:01:01] <Cork> dddh: that isn't notified
[01:01:15] <Cork> notified is "tell me when you add a new one or remove an old"
[01:01:30] <Cork> some systems support this
[01:02:11] <dddh> Cork: some systems do support this, but clustered pbx/db can't notify all web servers yet
[01:03:02] <Cork> dddh: ya, so you could have a small server pulling this data constantly on an interval and have it push updates it finds out over websocket
[01:03:15] <Cork> or have each client make a request to the server for the latest data
[01:03:39] <Cork> the former scales better, but if you have few users then the later is easier to implement (not much though)
[01:03:53] <dddh> I could add triggers to add changes to queue table, but now it is easier to poll it
[01:03:56] <Cork> biggest problem with websocket is if you use php
[01:04:02] <Cork> as it has a hard time supporting it
[01:04:17] <dddh> I use python/cherrypy/mako
[01:04:31] <Cork> then you could go either way
[01:04:42] <Cork> there are ready libs for websocket servers for python
[02:07:22] <Tomashe> hey guys, if i want to remove element from object, how do i do it
[02:15:22] <Cork> Tomashe: by elements do you meant properties?
[02:15:28] <Cork> or do you really mean dom elements?
[02:18:51] <c0d3n4m3> Morning
[02:18:57] <c0d3n4m3> - all :)
[02:35:03] <halpie> hello. i have two links previous and next that I want to replace with images using jquery, but I don't know on which element i have to do this replacement http://puu.sh/9n7lV/50a3bf5ae0.png
[02:40:30] <Cork> halpie: you want to remove the link, or make the link an image?
[02:40:48] <halpie> i want to transform the link as an image
[02:40:53] <raisin_> hello, I have a question. I want to use a trigger('click') on a non existing element that does have a .on('click') event. Basically, I want to run the callback function on the event, regardless of whether the element exists
[02:40:58] <raisin_> does anyone know if this is possible?
[02:41:03] <Cork> halpie: that doesn't really answer the question
[02:41:04] <halpie> which means that its container size will take the size of the image
[02:41:18] <Cork> halpie: you either want to remove the link and have an image in its sted
[02:41:23] <Cork> or make the content of the link an image
[02:41:32] <halpie> ahm ... i still want the link so that when i click on the image it works ?
[02:41:48] <halpie> i think i wanna make the content of the link an image, more likely
[02:41:49] <Cork> ok so you want to replace the content of the <a> tag with an <img> tag
[02:42:02] <halpie> i assume i do
[02:42:14] <halpie> but ye this is exactly what i wanna do actaually
[02:43:02] <Cork> raisin_: please separate the question from the info
[02:43:22] <Cork> raisin_: it makes it much simpler then having to scan through the blob of text to find the question
[02:45:36] <CrowX-> Cork, are you there
[02:45:37] <CrowX-> ?
[02:45:49] <Cork> ?ask
[02:45:49] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:48:08] <raisin_> does anyone know about triggering an event that is assigned to an non existing element?
[02:48:12] <CrowX-> Cork, I keep hearing that web development isn't real programming, and that it's easy and everyone could do it, etc. etc. Since you're a seasoned developer, would you agree with it?
[02:48:19] <WearingMyJimJams> does jquery not respond to click events for elements that were added dynamically by javascript
[02:48:21] <WearingMyJimJams> ?
[02:48:28] <Cork> raisin_: you can't trigger events on an element that doesn't exist
[02:48:48] <raisin_> WearingMyJimJams: That does work, but I don't want to append an empty element just to trigger the event
[02:48:55] <raisin_> I was hoping there is a more direct way
[02:49:02] <Cork> CrowX-: i would say it is someone that haven't looked into web development since mid 90's
[02:49:08] <raisin_> alright, thank you
[02:49:10] <WearingMyJimJams> haha my question was actually different from yours, just a coincidence
[02:49:11] <CrowX-> I can't judge myself, as I'm new in this, and I'm still struggling, but are other types of programming requiring more "intelligence"?
[02:49:18] <Cork> or have heard the slogan back then and keeps hanging on to it
[02:49:38] <Cork> CrowX-: you can be bad at most any language
[02:50:02] <Cork> yes there is proportionally more bad web (php?) developers
[02:50:23] <Cork> but web developing has been a real programing language for quite some time
[02:50:46] <CrowX-> I see
[02:50:48] <Cork> and if you do make sure to do it right it is just as "real" as any other language
[02:51:05] <raisin_> my bad WearingMyJimJams :)
[02:51:37] <Cork> CrowX-: the expression came from back when you basically only had c/c++ as laternative for native programming
[02:51:44] <Cork> CrowX-: those days are long gone
[02:56:00] <CrowX-> the thing is, I'm almost finished with my software engineering degree, and I've chosen web development as I assume there will be a high demand of it in the years to come. But I keep hearing it's "the weakest type of programming", and that it's what the worst programmers do. So I had some doubts lately whether to continue with web dev or try something else too.
[02:56:11] <CrowX-> But thanks for clearing that up for me
[02:56:30] <WearingMyJimJams> guys, is there a reason jquery would not respond to click events for elements that were added dynamically by javascript?
[02:58:12] <CrowX-> WearingMyJimJams, yes, the event is bound to all the existing elements when it's declared
[02:58:31] <WearingMyJimJams> how would you get around that?
[02:59:26] <CrowX-> WearingMyJimJams, I got around it by not adding such elements dynamically, but keeping them loaded with display:none, but I'm sure there's a better way to do it. Let's see what others have to say :)
[02:59:55] <Cork> CrowX-: i do development from html and js all the way down to services running data transport on socket level
[03:00:01] <LEU> hy who can tell me what type of hosting do i need for a text-based game ?
[03:00:09] <WearingMyJimJams> that’s actually a great idea, i’m stupid
[03:00:13] <WearingMyJimJams> thanks CrowX-
[03:00:16] <Cork> CrowX-: and no that statement on its own isn't even close to true
[03:00:40] <Cork> CrowX-: you can compare one language to another and state that one demands more of the developer then the other
[03:00:45] <Cork> but not generically like that
[03:01:56] <Cork> LEU: depends on how you intend to implement it
[03:02:10] <Cork> and if it will have multi players (on different computers) or not
[03:02:39] <Cork> LEU: basically it depends much more on the network load and if you need server scripting or not
[03:03:24] <LEU> Cork: i want to code php sql ofc html css and javascript
[03:03:42] <Cork> then you need a host that provides that
[03:04:19] <CrowX-> LEU, I could offer you hosting, depending on your game :)
[03:04:27] <Cork> php and sql supported hosts should be easy to find for a fairly low price
[03:05:34] <LEU> CrowX-: depending on what exactly about my game ?
[03:06:01] <LEU> i want to make one economy simulator
[03:06:45] <CrowX-> LEU, how much resources it would take. If it's light on the server, I could offer you hosting on my server for a low price.
[03:07:12] <CrowX-> LEU, so it's something like ogame/bloc/attrition?
[03:08:06] <LEU> like eRepublik kind of but with others ideeas implemented
[03:09:07] <LEU> i don't know about resources yet
[03:30:50] <Dirkos> How come that every <tr> is sortable and not the complete tbody?
[03:30:50] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/CQze3/1/
[03:34:53] <Cork> Dirkos: http://jsfiddle.net/CQze3/2/
[03:35:05] <Cork> though you will have some problems actually targeting tbody
[03:35:22] <Dirkos> yeah i have something working now
[03:35:22] <Cork> Dirkos: the default value for items is '> *'
[03:35:50] <Dirkos> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/CQze3/3/
[03:35:53] <Dirkos> this will do the trick though
[03:36:26] <Cork> uh
[03:36:33] <Cork> not sure how that would help
[03:36:45] <Cork> you only have one tbody so what to sort?
[03:36:52] <Dirkos> i have 2 tbody
[03:37:00] <Dirkos> all categories are tbody
[03:37:21] <Jattenalle> LEU, did you get your question answered?
[03:38:19] <Jattenalle> if not, just get any ~$5 webhost that gives you sql and php, once you need more it's a simple matter of switching host/upgrading
[03:38:27] <Jattenalle> dont start at the "I have a million players!" level
[03:38:32] <Jattenalle> there's no point
[03:46:42] <Dirkos> Cork, i only have 1 strange issue now
[03:46:42] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/CQze3/4/
[03:47:05] <Dirkos> start sorting the bottom rows
[03:47:13] <Dirkos> a/c/e
[05:01:44] <papifabi> hello! http://jsfiddle.net/fabifabi75/B2xBJ/
[05:01:52] <papifabi> that's write error and ssuccess after ?!?
[05:02:18] <Cork> ?deferred
[05:02:24] <Cork> <_<
[05:02:39] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[05:03:00] <Cork> papifabi: it is a way to attach callbacks to (mainly) async functions
[05:03:34] <papifabi> Cork> but why fail is call and success?!? normal ?
[05:04:10] <Cork> papifabi: done == success, fail == error
[05:04:16] <Cork> always == complete
[05:04:25] <papifabi> yes,exactly,but in my case,the TWO are called !
[05:04:36] <papifabi> that's my problem
[05:04:48] <papifabi> fail and succcess are called,in one call !
[05:04:57] <Cork> that should never happen
[05:05:04] <papifabi> yeah,that's why that's strange :s
[05:05:11] <papifabi> jquery bug ?!?
[05:06:11] <Cork> papifabi: no, most likely something in your code
[05:06:26] <papifabi> all is in the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fabifabi75/B2xBJ/
[05:06:39] <Cork> no the ajax call is there
[05:06:43] <Cork> that is FAR from all
[05:08:31] <papifabi> strange strange :(
[05:09:02] <carlsimpson> test
[05:09:06] <carlsimpson> hmm
[05:09:20] <carlsimpson> any javascript OOP gurus knocking around
[05:09:28] <Cork> ?ask
[05:09:28] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:10:00] <Cork> papifabi: to be able to help anything more a live example of the problem would be needed
[05:10:57] <carlsimpson> im looking for someone to point out the bleeding obvious when it comes to OOP , if anyone is feeling knowledgeable and wants to share .. let me know :)
[05:11:06] <papifabi> Cork> was a big typo in my fiddle :)
[05:11:16] <papifabi> thanks anyway
[05:11:23] <Cork> np
[05:29:03] <slax0r> maybe I'm losing it, but $("html, body").scrollTop(0); should scroll to top, right?
[05:31:18] <Cork> slax0r: after load, sure
[05:31:30] <Cork> before the onload event you might be overriden by the browser
[05:36:54] <slax0r> Cork: and if it's called in an ajax call success handler?
[05:37:16] <Cork> slax0r: should work just fine
[05:37:40] <slax0r> then I'm out of ideas why this doesn't work as I want it to
[05:37:49] <hooloovoo> slax0r: make a fiddle
[05:37:53] <Cork> slax0r: try to reduce the problem
[05:38:01] <Cork> and ya reproduce it in a clean environment
[05:38:13] <Cork> it usually helps in tracking down the cause
[05:38:39] <hooloovoo> making a fiddle that demonstrates the problem solves it as well 90% of the time. :)
[05:38:43] <slax0r> yeah, I'm tracking down the issue
[05:39:08] <slax0r> I don't think I'll make a fiddle, I more just wanted to make sure that such method would in fact scroll to top
[05:39:20] <slax0r> if I can't find the culprit...I'll be back, Arnie style ;)
[05:40:12] <Cork> hooloovoo: making a fiddle is an example of what i talked about :)
[05:40:39] <hooloovoo> Cork: Ya, i know.
[05:40:44] <slax0r> oh my...I'm going to have to shoot one or more of my co-workers
[05:40:47] <slax0r> ajax after ajax :/
[05:40:56] <Cork> :)
[05:41:29] <Cork> slax0r: well that shouldn't be a problem
[05:41:37] <Cork> as long as they don't depend on each other that is :)
[05:42:19] <slax0r> Cork: no, the ajax shouldn't be a problem
[05:42:39] <slax0r> but one ajax returns an url, then another ajax calls that url and retreives some markup
[05:42:51] <Cork> ah
[05:42:58] <slax0r> why not return the markup already in the first place, if you have to obtain markup with ajax in the first place
[05:43:01] <Cork> ya so the depends on huh...
[05:43:08] <Cork> ya
[05:43:18] <Cork> well some apis is built that way
[05:43:23] <slax0r> yeah, but the markup is injected in a modal
[05:43:29] <Cork> if you control the end point the that is another thing
[05:43:34] <slax0r> we do..
[05:43:49] <slax0r> would have to git blame through, maybe it was me who did it :D
[05:44:04] <Cork> *oh, then it's fine!* :D
[05:44:43] <hooloovoo> "It's a design pattern" <- I've built it
[05:44:53] <Cork> :)
[05:45:00] <hooloovoo> "It's a slow mess" <- Someone elses design pattern :)
[05:45:05] <slax0r> Cork: well no, even if I made it, it's not fine
[05:45:10] <slax0r> but you know, 6 months rule ;)
[05:45:19] <Cork> slax0r: i know, i was just joking ^^
[05:48:08] <slax0r> that's weird, even running that scrollTop in dev tools doesn't move the scroll
[06:30:43] <HelperW> hi
[06:30:54] <HelperW> What was again the function to move a div into another?

[06:44:03] <inad922> hello
[06:44:42] <inad922> What kind of parameters does the datatables ajax call send back?
[06:47:16] <timkofu> hi guys
[06:47:22] <timkofu> i need to apply two functions to one id
[06:47:25] <timkofu> $('#id').focus().addClass('da_class');
[06:47:29] <timkofu> but only fucous gets applied
[06:47:42] <timkofu> i want to add a class then focus on it
[06:51:00] <timkofu> anyone?
[06:51:17] <drej> inad922 wrong channel, and that question is really vague
[06:51:38] <drej> err not wrong channel, sorry
[06:51:38] <inad922> drej: Why is this the wrong channel?
[06:51:44] <drej> i thought i was in #css, my bad
[06:51:48] <drej> ~ops
[06:51:50] <drej> nargas is spamming people
[06:51:57] <drej> cc ajpiano vladikoff
[06:51:57] <drej> etc
[06:52:51] <timkofu> drej: I want to apply a class to an element then focus on it via its id. thats all
[06:53:23] <timkofu> inad922: can you help?
[06:53:29] <inad922> drej: Why is it vague? I mean I would need something like page_number, result_per_page and maybe an ordering
[06:53:53] <drej> inad922 again, sorry, i thought i was sitting in a different channel, and datatable is a generic term for databases in general
[06:53:59] <drej> within context of it being a jquery plugin, it makes sense
[06:54:16] <drej> my mistake
[06:54:18] <inad922> drej: Nah, I mean the datatables library
[06:54:30] <inad922> yep the jquery plugin
[06:54:34] <timkofu> jeesss
[06:54:37] <inad922> https://datatables.net
[06:57:42] <timkofu> ah
[06:57:47] <timkofu> you just chain the functions
[06:57:49] <timkofu> bah
[06:58:30] <slax0r> why does $("body").scrollTop() return 0 on chrome but an actual value on ff?
[07:24:04] <hagabaka> I'm trying to find all images *as well as the closest span.foo before each image*. What's an easy way to go about it?
[07:25:05] <thebope> $("img, span.foo").each()?
[07:25:34] <thebope> jquery supports comma separated values in selectors. not sure if you want them together or all the elements individually
[07:26:40] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: The "closest" in what sense?
[07:26:59] <hagabaka> in the document order
[07:27:11] <BillCriswell> Some people say "closest" meaniing like... next to the element, in jQuery closest means parent wise.
[07:27:37] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: So after maybe?
[07:27:42] <hagabaka> I know the $("img, span.foo") part, but with that, I still have to find the index, and loop back the list and check each one. I'm wondering if there are better ways to do it
[07:28:12] <monk12> hey all, any good place to ask an html question other than #html. They kicked me out of there TWICE for trying to help some peeps (after calling me a retard and in a private message a dumb **** heh).
[07:28:25] <shoky> slax0r has to do with this i imagine  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19635188/why-is-body-scrolltop-deprecated
[07:28:34] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: Wouldn't just $('span.foo img') do what you need?
[07:28:38] <shoky> not that i really understand it
[07:29:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: I don't understand anything anymore.
[07:29:15] <monk12> Their argument was nobody should be using a CSS framework or CSS reset library, so we shouldnt' help people that are using them... heh.
[07:29:47] <monk12> and I'm dumb for using Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation going to production... ouch.
[07:30:08] <BillCriswell> monk12: There's #web
[07:30:17] <shoky> BillCriswell me neither. 30hrs with no sleep takes its toll
[07:30:18] <BillCriswell> Which might be able to help.
[07:30:21] <monk12> Cool thanks BillCriswell, I'll check it out.
[07:30:54] <BillCriswell> monk12: I can understand people arging against a CSS framework maybe bt arguing against a reset / normalization seems weird.
[07:31:12] <BillCriswell> I don't understand the name calling lol. Just a difference in opinion.
[07:31:15] <hagabaka> BillCriswell: no. I'll just omit class="text" now,  with <span>A</span><img src=B>C<span>D</span><img src=F><img src=G>, I want a result of [[A, B], [D, F], [D, G]]
[07:31:29] <monk12> yeh... no less... be nice for room for debate... not a straight up ban.
[07:32:45] <hagabaka> so the obvious way is $("img, span.foo").each and if the item is an image, search index - 1, index -2, ... until I find a span, and pair with that image
[07:32:50] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: $('span').each(function() { var $span = $(this), $img = $span.next(); }); or do you really want to build an array of elements structured just like that?
[07:33:24] <hagabaka> BillCriswell: not all spans will have images directly following them
[07:33:51] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: You could do .nextAll('img').eq(0)
[07:34:58] <hagabaka> but they could be at different levels of the tree too, so I have to use jQuery('span, img') and operate on the result set, I think
[07:36:10] <hagabaka> if they were all siblings, jQuery('img').prevAll('span.text').first() would work for me
[07:36:10] <BillCriswell> Sounds like quite a shit hole of a situation.
[07:37:19] <xec> hagabaka: if you make a demo with the html in question and all the possible scenarios it will be easier to see what might be possible to do
[07:39:14] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a _.zip()  situation.
[07:39:42] <BillCriswell> Two separate arrays of elements, and zip them into eachother.
[07:42:53] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: http://jsbin.com/xojihuyo/1/edit?html,js,output ?
[07:44:22] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: http://jsbin.com/xojihuyo/2/edit?html,js,output * litle clearer.
[07:45:17] <HelperW> Someosuggestions? I have to translate a Flex Slider
[07:45:29] <HelperW> I have 1 page tranlsated by the
[07:46:03] <HelperW> qTranslate plugin but i am not able to translate my flexslider. or use an other for a specific language.
[07:51:29] <^rcaskey> hey, I've done a good bit of jquery in the past and figured I'd give jquery-mobile a try but i'm getting stopped early on - I can't get any of the fancy widgets to appear at all. http://www.caskey.org:7000/ <-- the header is styled right and all the script urls are valid but the list still isn't fancy
[07:54:32] <shoky> ^rcaskey: it's "listview" not "list-view"
[07:54:39] <hagabaka> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/xojihuyo/7/edit is what I mean
[07:54:48] <^rcaskey> tada
[07:54:50] <^rcaskey> thank you
[07:54:54] <StephenS> tada
[07:55:55] <BillCriswell> hagabaka: So we got it?!
[07:56:46] <hagabaka> no
[07:58:46] <hellothere> hey guys, I got something like that http://jsfiddle.net/eTg8B/1/ user.json = the html thing hmm it wont get it right any ideas?
[08:05:58] <shoky> hellothere: what?
[08:06:52] <hellothere> am trying to pull out the ids only of enabled users from that json file as presented on the jsfiddle using linq js but it would present an array of undefined when i run it localy
[08:07:09] <Kitu> hello
[08:07:58] <Kitu> how to select all text nodes and a node with a specific class ?
[08:09:02] <hlvwrk> o.o
[08:09:05] <shoky> hellothere: then check the received json
[08:09:29] <inad922> How can I convince datatables to send over the page number when I'm making an ajax call to the backend
[08:09:30] <inad922> ?
[08:09:55] <Kitu> I have tried : $('#test').html(msg.find('*:text, .emoticon'));
[08:10:14] <Kitu> but *:text it's not for text nodes appearly
[08:10:14] <pedda> hi all
[08:10:27] <BillCriswell> Kitu: You'd need to use .contents()
[08:10:32] <Kitu> yes but ...
[08:10:33] <Kitu> :(
[08:10:42] <Kitu> ok
[08:10:44] <pedda> i'm trying to delay an ajax request due to a modal based form.. i want the form to close before the reuest is send
[08:10:46] <BillCriswell> Kitu: https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[08:11:11] <BillCriswell> So like... msg.contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType === 3; }); for the text nodes.
[08:11:22] <Kitu> and for the class ?
[08:11:23] <antlong_> im trying to .load an html file that is local in a modal, but im seeing Received an invalid response. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. I'm not sure how to fix it
[08:11:29] <StephenS> so like bitwise is 10 01
[08:11:32] <StephenS> 0 10 110
[08:12:05] <shoky> hellothere: if that's your json on top then maybe you want Enumerable.from(json.Items)
[08:12:28] <hellothere> shoky: ive tried doing that and it returns undefined
[08:13:16] <Kitu> BillCriswell I want to select text nodes and a class in the same time, in the order of read ...
[08:13:46] <shoky> hellothere: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/eTg8B/2/
[08:14:11] <BillCriswell> Kitu: msg.contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType === 3 || $(this).is('.emoticon'); }); maybe?
[08:14:25] <shoky> hellothere: actually it didn't filter
[08:14:36] <hellothere> yes i see that
[08:14:41] <Kitu> I'm trying
[08:16:14] <Kitu> BillCriswell just text nodes
[08:17:45] <shoky> hellothere: anyway no need for linq.js  http://jsfiddle.net/eTg8B/3/
[08:18:22] <Kitu> another .filter maybe
[08:18:24] <BillCriswell> Kitu: That's not what I'm seeing.
[08:18:49] <Kitu> http://jsfiddle.net/LVD8N/11/
[08:19:35] <Kitu> ah
[08:20:09] <hellothere> thanks shoky
[08:20:12] <hellothere> :)
[08:20:16] <Kitu> I don't see :(
[08:20:51] <jangoh> How do i write a jquery function when select a checkbox by name
[08:20:58] <hlvwrk> Ops; nargas is pming me with some sketchy ass link
[08:20:58] <hlvwrk> possibly be a virus
[08:20:59] <hlvwrk> ;[
[08:21:02] <BillCriswell> jangoh: Attribute selectors.
[08:21:15] <jangoh>  $('input[name='checkbox-811']').click(function() { alert('hi');  });
[08:21:20] <jangoh> tried like this
[08:21:37] <shoky> hlvwrk: show gratis.. ?
[08:21:49] <hlvwrk> shoelessone:  yes
[08:21:52] <drej> jangoh you need to use " and ' respectively
[08:21:52] <hlvwrk> shoky*
[08:22:06] <hlvwrk> ty
[08:22:11] <drej> thanks shoky
[08:22:16] <drej> i always forget to ping you when i need an op
[08:22:19] <drej> only ajpiano and vlad
[08:22:26] <hlvwrk> pretty sure he was trying to spread a virus or something
[08:22:33] <jangoh> drej what would be correct syntax
[08:22:45] <drej> $('input[name="checkbox-811"]').click(function() { alert('hi');  });
[08:22:47] <drej> should do it
[08:22:48] <Kitu> BillCriswell I don't see the image here
[08:22:59] <jangoh> its inside a php echo ' '
[08:23:06] <jangoh> so using  ' '
[08:23:07] <hlvwrk> jangoh: why on earth are you targeting an element by its' name?
[08:23:08] <hlvwrk> o_O
[08:23:13] <hlvwrk> bad practice homie
[08:23:15] <drej> jangoh so escape the \
[08:23:19] <drej> err '
[08:23:43] <drej> and why is it in a php echo
[08:23:50] <jangoh> checkboxes are like this   <input type="checkbox" value="Very easy" name="checkbox-811">
[08:24:02] <hlvwrk> input[type=checkbox]?
[08:24:18] <jangoh> i have group of checkbox with same name
[08:24:27] <hlvwrk> okay, and?
[08:24:34] <jangoh> so want to trigger when any of them select
[08:24:35] <drej> hlvwrk maybe he doesnt want it for all checkboxes
[08:24:36] <hlvwrk> div.container input[type=checkbox]
[08:24:42] <hlvwrk> lol
[08:24:44] <drej> but yeah, container makes more sense
[08:24:46] <BillCriswell> Kitu: http://jsbin.com/kutebixo/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:25:23] <jangoh> ah need to change selector then
[08:25:49] <Kitu> hum
[08:26:11] <hlvwrk> bad practice to target something like that by its' name.. unless it truly can't be wrapped in a container
[08:26:16] <jangoh> drej its a wordpress plugin
[08:26:25] <drej> you're a wordpress plugin!
[08:26:26] <hlvwrk> people still make those?
[08:26:29] <drej> i mean, so?
[08:26:36] <drej> you can still have external js files
[08:26:53] <jangoh> yes but its simple :)
[08:26:59] <drej> clearly.
[08:27:02] <hlvwrk> lol
[08:27:04] <jangoh> making it as simple i can
[08:27:11] <hlvwrk> what does it do?
[08:27:23] <hlvwrk> sell me on it
[08:27:25] <hlvwrk> I have a blog!
[08:27:25] <jangoh> actually its contact form popup
[08:27:31] <hlvwrk> i already have a contact form though
[08:27:32] <jangoh> lol
[08:27:45] <jangoh> using jquery dialog to popup
[08:27:56] <hlvwrk> seems bulky
[08:28:18] <drej> i hope you're including its own version of jquery + jquery UI with it
[08:28:20] <drej> cuz thats always fun
[08:28:31] <Kitu> HUM
[08:28:33] <Kitu> :)
[08:28:34] <drej> i saw a wordpress blog the other day that had 8 different jquery versions included through various plugins
[08:28:35] <hlvwrk> loooool'
[08:28:38] <drej> it was magnificent
[08:28:48] <hlvwrk> thats terrifying
[08:28:54] <jangoh> i am including gogole jquery link
[08:29:00] <jangoh> google*
[08:32:06] <Kitu> BillCriswell it doesn't work with html in a string
[08:32:31] <Kitu> http://jsbin.com/quwuhuze/1/
[08:32:40] <Kitu> erf
[08:33:14] <drej> i havent used jquery in like a year
[08:33:15] <drej> i miss it
[08:33:18] <Kitu> http://jsbin.com/quwuhuze/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:35:00] <shoky> Kitu: .contents() takes the inner contents of the root element(s). so in your case it's taking the inner contents of the <img> and the 2 <div>s  (those 3 are the root elements)
[08:35:35] <shoky> Kitu: you can wrap it in a <div>  http://jsbin.com/quwuhuze/4/edit
[08:35:53] <Kitu> ok
[08:36:22] <shoky> uh also it only gets the 1st level contents only
[08:36:23] <BillCriswell> I was just getting back, what shoky says is right.
[08:36:29] <Kitu> but no text here shoky
[08:36:41] <Kitu> hum
[08:36:43] <Kitu> :(
[08:37:16] <Kitu> it's complicated
[08:37:25] <BillCriswell> Kitu: http://jsbin.com/kutebixo/4/edit?html,js,output ?
[08:37:52] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/kutebixo/5/edit
[08:38:57] <shoky> BillCriswell: he wants IGNORE ME THING to show, though, no?
[08:39:13] <shoky> hm.. and Meow ?
[08:39:20] <shoky> so what if its not an emoticon?
[08:39:24] <BillCriswell> shoky: I don' think so... since it's not a "text node" maybe?
[08:39:29] <shoky> Meow is a text node
[08:39:36] <shoky> all text is a text node
[08:39:44] <Kitu> I want parse all html in fact from string in fact
[08:39:54] <Kitu> I want parse all html from string in fact*
[08:39:56] <shoky> .contents().filter   just isn't recursive like .find is
[08:40:04] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah, that.
[08:40:13] <BillCriswell> I assumed direct children.
[08:40:19] <Kitu> ok :o\
[08:40:20] <BillCriswell> Kitu: Should probably change your entire approach haha
[08:41:01] <Kitu> people said me that regex is not the good approach
[08:41:04] <Kitu> ...
[08:42:32] <Kitu> what do you advise me?
[08:43:38] <BillCriswell> Kitu: Where is the source string coming from?
[08:43:56] <Kitu> from node.js server
[08:45:38] <shoky> hah
[08:45:42] <shoky> goddamn jsbin
[08:45:48] <duch_kazatel> jsbin--
[08:46:01] <shoky> i'm trying to write:  $clone.contents().add( $clone.find....
[08:46:16] <shoky> well i already had:  $clone.contents.add()....
[08:46:25] <shoky> so i wanna type $clone.something  inside the add()
[08:46:28] <shoky> the second i type the $
[08:46:33] <shoky> it goes bersek
[08:46:35] <shoky> berserk
[08:46:41] <shoky> cause.. $clone.contents.add($)
[08:46:53] <duch_kazatel> autorunfail
[08:47:15] <shoky> aye
[08:47:17] <Kitu> I'm french, I don't understand all here :p
[08:47:27] <systemfault> Damn french.
[08:47:32] <Kitu> systemfault :p
[08:47:34] <duch_kazatel> I'm american and don't understand all here sometimes, too.
[08:47:51] <systemfault> I'm canadian and don't understand all here sometimes, too.
[08:47:54] <Kitu> :P
[08:47:59] <duch_kazatel> :D
[08:49:45] <Kitu> shoky do you code a recursivly contents() ?
[08:49:47] <s2013> i want to dynamically change slideshow as it is being played.. is that possible? basically as people uploads new picture or changes speed, etc. the slideshow changes
[08:50:07] <shoky> Kitu: was trying to, sort of
[08:50:22] <shoky> i'm too tired ;]
[08:50:30] <shoky> and jsbin is in my way
[08:50:51] <duch_kazatel> s2013 probably depends on the carousel plugin and what exactly you want to have change.
[08:52:02] <s2013> http://reallysimpleworks.com/slideshow/ im using this
[08:52:15] <s2013> basically i want to be able to reload the slideshow
[08:52:23] <s2013> this one allows arrays
[08:52:59] <duch_kazatel> s2013 that part isn't all that important ;) you could always delete the current slideshow and reinitialize.
[08:53:28] <bee_keeper> hi, i want something like el.parents('my_selector'), but stopping at the first match - is there some fucntion which does this?  maybe a reverse find?
[08:53:35] <shoky> Kitu: this maybe possibly works, or something. http://jsbin.com/kutebixo/8/edit
[08:53:44] <shoky> probably overkill
[08:53:46] <Kitu> ok thanks
[08:54:24] <s2013> hmm i guess by addin ga lcick button
[08:55:28] <shoky> bee_keeper: .closest('selector')
[08:55:51] <duch_kazatel> s2013 you could also proxy your changes to do the delete/init cycle, but without knowing your UX it's hard to say.
[08:55:56] <duch_kazatel> you have choices, though
[08:56:02] <s2013> http://codepen.io/ss2k/pen/dBFLe/ duch_kazatel
[08:56:04] <s2013> is what i have
[08:56:08] <s2013> if you upload pics you see you can sort them
[08:56:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Have you tried CraftCMS?
[08:56:25] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nope.
[08:56:31] <BillCriswell> Well, Craft*
[08:56:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's pretty cool so far. Messing around with it.
[08:56:47] <Kitu> it's work, thanks again shoky
[08:57:42] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell looks neat
[08:57:51] <bee_keeper> shoky: ah that's the one.  thanks!
[08:58:01] <duch_kazatel> i like the simplicity.
[08:58:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it stays out of your way pretty good.
[08:58:27] <BillCriswell> Pritty, pritty, pritty good.
[09:03:46] <decx> you forgot a pretty it's 4
[09:21:33] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help. I have a popup I'd like to show on pageload with a cookie that expires when the page is refreshed. The cookie function says that if the cookie exists, don't show the popup. This works. What I'd like to do is delete the cookie when the page is reloaded so that the popup will show for hte new "session"
[09:22:05] <Jattenalle> set the cookie lifetime to 0
[09:22:18] <Jattenalle> ashgotti, ^^
[09:22:31] <ashgotti> http://pastebin.com/0edwtLwa That's what I have so far
[09:22:33] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti if you don't supply an expiration to the cookie, that'x exactly what you'll get.
[09:23:00] <ashgotti> oh is it that easy? expiry 0 means just for that session?
[09:23:05] <duch_kazatel> yes
[09:23:06] <Jattenalle> yup
[09:23:18] <Jattenalle> a value > 0 but "in the past" = remove it right now
[09:23:27] <Jattenalle> a value in the future = keep until then
[09:23:48] <ashgotti> I've been trying to work on the onpagereload part for a while now…i should have come here first
[09:24:12] <duch_kazatel> :) remove lines 13 through 16 in your paste for to start.
[09:24:19] <duch_kazatel> *for a start
[09:25:03] <ashgotti> Yup, got rid of those and added { expires: 0 } to my code
[09:25:49] <ashgotti> Testing...
[09:26:14] <ashgotti> Hm.. I still see console.log "Cookie exists"
[09:26:26] <duch_kazatel> share your updated code?
[09:26:51] <ashgotti> sorry, here http://pastebin.com/NqGEKfGk
[09:26:57] <ashgotti> I should probably check if the cookie is created at all
[09:26:58] <duch_kazatel> ugh pastebin.
[09:27:03] <ashgotti> jsfiddle?
[09:27:06] <duch_kazatel> which cookie plugin are you using?
[09:27:27] <ashgotti> http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/
[09:27:31] <ashgotti> jquery.cookie
[09:27:37] <ashgotti> in a drupal environment
[09:27:51] <duch_kazatel> there are a lot named "jquery.cookie" - can you link to the docs for this one?
[09:28:03] <ashgotti> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[09:28:51] <ashgotti> just verified and the cookie does exist
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> $.cookie('name', 'value');
[09:29:11] <duch_kazatel> that's all you need.
[09:29:54] <ashgotti> that's what I have. jQuery.cookie('kiosk','YES',{ expires: 0 }); //set cookie (using jQuery instead of $)
[09:30:06] <duch_kazatel> remove that third argument.
[09:30:18] <duch_kazatel> per the documentation, $.cookie('name', 'value'); creates a session cookie.
[09:30:49] <ashgotti> Will do
[09:30:50] <duch_kazatel> also you're using a jquery closure that lets you use $, so why not use it?
[09:31:08] <ashgotti> that's a good question
[09:31:41] <duch_kazatel> also, your logic is munged.
[09:31:47] <ashgotti> When I refresh (does that coutn as a new session?) I still get Cookie exists
[09:31:53] <ashgotti> I really appreciate this help btw
[09:31:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/2/
[09:32:01] <ashgotti> munged, let me urban dictionary that
[09:32:02] <duch_kazatel> refresh !== new session.
[09:32:19] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=define+munged&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb
[09:32:29] <duch_kazatel> look at that new fiddle.
[09:32:47] <ashgotti> Yup, trying it now
[09:32:54] <DeafGoose> i have a list of elements in a form and Im checking each on a conditional to display an alert if something is wrong...however jquery is following the alphabetical order of the ids instead of the order they are on the form...anyway to get around this?
[09:33:15] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose the IDs on the object?
[09:33:29] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose or what?
[09:33:32] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: the cookie gets created, but refreshing/reloading the page does not delete/create a new one
[09:33:42] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti right.  because you're in the same session.
[09:33:46] <duch_kazatel> close your browser and reopen.
[09:34:42] <DeafGoose> $('#banner') and $('#link') ...link is first on the form but the conditional checks first #banner
[09:34:53] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I closed chrome, opened it and no "Cookie created" message. I need it to work on refresh/reload because of my use case.

[09:35:23] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti then that's not based on session.  that's going to be rough.
[09:35:41] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti can you clearly define your logic, start to end, then?

[09:36:06] <duch_kazatel> woah....
[09:36:48] <duch_kazatel> first off, don't use ==, use ===
[09:36:48] <DeafGoose> my question is, if I click the button, the modal that pops up first is "banner"...should be link_name
[09:36:58] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose and use a series of else ifs instead.
[09:36:59] <DeafGoose> know what i mean?
[09:37:04] <spencerk> hey all, is there a trick to doing $("<div>random text</div>").width()
[09:37:13] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: my apologies. This is for a touch screen kiosk. I have a prompt that I'd like to show that says "touch to begin". Using cookies, I'd like that to show on the frontpage only when the page is loaded. If they go to one section and come back to the front, I don't want them to see the "touch to begin". That's why I'm using cookies. I have a timer for 5 minutes. If the kiosk is idle for 5 minutes, I have it reloading to the frontpage. I've

[09:37:44] <spencerk> i'm trying to inspect how big a string will render, before i display it
[09:38:30] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti that cut off, but i think i get the gist.  is there a button to "go back" or "start over" or anything like that?
[09:39:01] <DeafGoose> thanks such!
[09:39:04] <DeafGoose> duch*
[09:39:05] <DeafGoose> sorry :D
[09:39:09] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose does that help at all?
[09:39:37] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: there is a back button on each page. Actually you can see a demo here (without the prompt, not added to the demo yet): http://lemonlimedesigns.ca/tohr/kiosk it uses jquery mobile
[09:39:39] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose that'll only check one field at a time btw.  dunno what that whole story is with the order of things.
[09:39:54] <DeafGoose> yea, it actually did....although I had to use == instead of === for select2("val")
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti it sounds like you need the modal for somebody just arriving to the kiost.
[09:40:08] <duch_kazatel> DeafGoose then you need to change what you're comparing to.
[09:40:16] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: that's right. I'm using a popup but modal will work too. I just need it only show with a new "session"
[09:40:25] <DeafGoose> i c
[09:40:30] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti okay - and what action defines a new "session"?
[09:40:36] <ashgotti> and sessions being defined by page reloads not browser opening and closing
[09:40:56] <duch_kazatel> can your UI include a button that starts a new one?
[09:41:16] <ashgotti> the goAway() function in my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/3/ which just brings the user back to the front page. I just thought if someone used the kiosk and walks away and it's not on the front page, it'll confuse the next user
[09:41:22] <ashgotti> I'd like it to be automatic
[09:41:38] <ashgotti> I could add a cookie delete in the goAway() function?
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'd do.
[09:41:56] <ashgotti> ok I'll give it a whirl
[09:42:02] <duch_kazatel> instead of relying on browser events imo.  that might make more sense.
[09:42:38] <ashgotti> the only other issue is that the popup does not work the way I have it now. If I move it out of the function to create the cookie, it works. within it and when I delete the cookie, it doesn't work
[09:42:50] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.
[09:43:35] <ashgotti> http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/3/ the section where i have the popup does not work. If i move it outside of that function, it works
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  sounds like the popup isn't initialized in time?  not sure.
[09:44:57] <ashgotti> thanks again for all the help!
[09:45:04] <antlong_> looking for contributors for an open source sci-fi game. rev share offered. msg for info.
[09:45:10] <duch_kazatel> also check out using .on() for event bindings.
[09:45:42] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ still looking for contributors?
[09:46:31] <antlong_> duch_kazatel yes, a couple of people with some time to spare really.
[09:46:40] <antlong_> duch_kazatel i have a nice group but some drop off here and there.
[09:46:52] <duch_kazatel> =/
[09:47:18] <antlong_> 30 contribs, maybe 8 core at this point (meaning they commit semiweekly)
[09:54:51] <antlong_> duch_kazatel ideally offering rev share now would boost commits
[09:55:19] <duch_kazatel> antlong_ i'd argue this isn't an appropriate place to find contributors, but meh.
[09:55:38] <antlong_> we use jquery heavily :)
[09:56:32] <duch_kazatel> this channel is dedicated to providing assistance to people having problems with jquery - you're looking for contributors, which I'd argue is off topic, but i'm sure others would disagree.
[09:59:24] <Jattenalle> heh, revenue share
[10:00:06] <inad922> How can I indicate the total number of entries in datatables if I get pages via ajax calls?
[10:00:23] <duch_kazatel> inad922 by supplying that data via your ajax call.
[10:04:04] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: this will probably be obvious, but do you know why I'm getting an undefined is not a function error with the removeCookie in this: http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/4/
[10:04:53] <duch_kazatel> you're calling the function before the plugin has loaded.
[10:06:14] <duch_kazatel> wrap all of your logic in that document readyt.
[10:06:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/5/
[10:07:46] <ashgotti> ..duh. Thanks so much
[10:08:05] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[10:09:44] <ashgotti> Hm.. I'm still getting the Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function error for the removeCookie line
[10:09:55] <ashgotti> I changed it to $ from jQuery
[10:10:25] <Woet> ashgotti: where?
[10:10:27] <Woet> on jsfiddle?
[10:10:48] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti you're changing the page URL and then calling that function.  call the plugin first.

[10:12:55] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: hate bugging you but same issue: http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/7/ is that what you meant?
[10:13:13] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti yeah.  if that doesn't work, I'd need to see a working fiddle.
[10:13:18] <duch_kazatel> becuase that means you have another issue.
[10:14:38] <ashgotti> following this: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie to use removeCookie. Could that be the problem?
[10:14:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:15:23] <ashgotti> Sorry, I meant I'm using the documentation there to use $.removeCookie. That error, does it refer to the $ or the .removeCookie?
[10:16:07] <duch_kazatel> that error is probably over the removeCookie, but you could console.log($) and see what happens.
[10:20:28] <dddh> jphase: Donker Mag?
[10:20:40] <jphase> say what now?
[10:21:17] <duch_kazatel> that's my next band name

[10:21:31] <dddh> jphase: ^^
[10:22:12] <jphase> haha, no, it's the politically correct version of "MAH NIGGAS"... which is no longer politically correct since you just made me say it lol
[10:22:18] <Mateo_> Hi !
[10:23:09] <dddh> :)
[10:24:21] <Mateo_> I have a listview that I fill with append(). In this listview, I’ve added a control group (I need 4 buttons). But it looks like because it is append, I can’t bind anything to these buttons.
[10:24:32] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ you what now?
[10:25:11] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: ($) console.log spits out function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)}
[10:25:25] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti then i'd need to see a functioning fiddle.  sorry!
[10:25:42] <ashgotti> Sorry about that, you did mention it
[10:29:10] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Bme9n/6/
[10:29:36] <Mateo_> I’ve tried to remove all the unnecessary markup
[10:30:15] <duch_kazatel> okay.  what was the problem again?
[10:31:32] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I append content to my listview (element with a controlgroup of 4 buttons, 1 in the example). That is working. But I can’t bind a vclick event to these buttons in the control group
[10:32:13] <duch_kazatel> what line are you binding the click?
[10:32:46] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: 48 . I’ve tried many version for the bind but no luck.
[10:33:16] <duch_kazatel> $("#home").on("vclick","#contactCALL", function(){});
[10:33:35] <duch_kazatel> does #home exist on pageload?
[10:35:09] <duch_kazatel> and why not just use click instead?
[10:37:24] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: ok, so that was a syntax problem :( sometimes I feel so dumb. SO.
[10:37:46] <duch_kazatel> no need to feel dumb, just make sure you're learning from your mistakes.
[10:37:59] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I tried with touchstart first, but it didn’t work too so I tried vclick … But with the correct syntax and touchstart it’s working
[10:38:08] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: Oooooh I do that. I do :)
[10:38:51] <Mateo_> In fact, for every problem I came here for, I didn’t have a lot of luck with help so I kept on searching, and always found a solution, except for that one …
[10:38:52] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to read about event delegation and bubbling.
[10:39:15] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I will. But bubbling ? What’s that ?
[10:40:09] <duch_kazatel> :) something you need to read about.
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> the short of it is events "bubble up" through the document.
[10:45:48] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure if this will help at all but this is the specific error I get "object doesn't support property or method 'removeCookie' " Is it because it's inside a function?http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/7/
[10:46:08] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti it's because the plugin has not been loaded by the time you call it.
[10:46:20] <ashgotti> the plugin being jquery.cookie?
[10:46:25] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:46:54] <ashgotti> I moved that function below the section that creates the cookie but that didn't fix it. Wouldn't that do it?
[10:46:58] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter where you call it from.
[10:46:59] <ashgotti> or shouldn't that do it?
[10:47:16] <duch_kazatel> you're not loading the plugin in time.
[10:47:20] <duch_kazatel> this is a race condition.
[10:51:51] <ashgotti> Thanks. I'm not sure how else to structure this.
[10:51:52] <Yahkob> If I have a -webkit-animation property in my CSS if I use toggle on the node it will do the animation, is there anything like toggle that doesn't hide the visibility of the node?
[10:52:00] <Yahkob> Not sure really how else to ask
[10:52:08] <Yahkob> what does toggle do besides hide and show
[10:52:09] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti are you loading the plugin before this file?
[10:52:19] <ashgotti> in the <head> you mean?
[10:52:36] <ashgotti> It is registered by Drupal (the CMS I'm using) already.
[10:52:44] <duch_kazatel> that's... not what I asked.
[10:52:44] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: Thanks for your help :) I’m going to read that
[10:52:55] <ashgotti> sorry :( learning JS/jquery
[10:52:57] <duch_kazatel> is your JS loaded after the plugin?
[10:53:13] <duch_kazatel> Yahkob i'd read the docs for toggle.
[10:53:56] <tuskkk___> HI duch_kazatel
[10:54:07] <duch_kazatel> hello
[10:54:35] <ashgotti> This is my JS code in it's entirety. I don't think I'm loading anything http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/8/
[10:54:57] <tuskkk___> duch_kazatel: learning Mandrill today!
[10:55:00] <duch_kazatel> ashka the plugin has to be loaded by the page.  view your page source.
[10:55:03] <Yahkob> hmm
[10:55:12] <duch_kazatel> tuskkk___ cool.
[10:57:08] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: Now I understand what you're asking. jquery.cookie.js is loaded. the cookie does get created properly and that uses jquery.cookie.js.
[10:57:32] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti is the jquery.cookie.js file getting loaded before your code?
[10:58:33] <ashgotti> yes, the JS file is loaded in <head>, my code is in the footer.
[10:59:15] <duch_kazatel> okay. then you have another problem.  without seeing a functioning example that demonstrates the error, i'm not really able to help.
[10:59:49] <ashgotti> It's on a closed network. The only way to show someone is through teamviewer which is asking a lot of you
[10:59:57] <duch_kazatel> ...
[11:00:09] <duch_kazatel> let me rephrase then - I don't know what your problem is.
[11:00:10] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[11:00:16] <ashgotti> oh hah ok.
[11:00:19] <duch_kazatel> something isn't adding up.
[11:00:20] <ashgotti> Thanks again
[11:00:50] <ashgotti> I'm going to guess it has to do with some sort of conflict having to do with all the jquery, jquery ui, jquery mobile files being loaded
[11:01:04] <duch_kazatel> you're only loading jquery itself once, right?
[11:02:16] <ashgotti> Nope, looks like I have jquery 1.10.2, jquery.mobile, jquery 1.7.1 (built into drupal), jquery.cookie
[11:02:37] <duch_kazatel> there's your problem.
[11:02:41] <duch_kazatel> you're loading jquery twice.
[11:02:44] <drej> yup, thats definitely the problem
[11:02:49] <drej> you need to load it at least 3 more times
[11:02:53] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:02:54] <drej> and make sure they're different versions
[11:02:58] <drej> with at least one 2.* and one 1.*
[11:03:02] <ashgotti> hahah
[11:03:03] <duch_kazatel> but seriously, you need to kill of 1.7.1
[11:03:16] <duch_kazatel> (and don't say "it's built into drupal")
[11:03:28] <duch_kazatel> you either get new and shiny, or old and decrepit.
[11:03:29] <ashgotti> i added 1.10.1 for jquery mobile ui. 1.7.1 is what comes with drupal
[11:03:39] <duch_kazatel> they cannot coexist.
[11:03:40] <drej> ashgotti just boot the 1.7.1 on
[11:03:41] <drej> one*
[11:03:44] <drej> remove it with extreme prejudice
[11:03:54] <drej> well , they _CAN_ co-exist, but there's no reason for them to
[11:04:02] <ashgotti> le sigh… ok i'm going to remove one and see what happens
[11:04:14] <duch_kazatel> your only other option is to noconflict things up, but that'll bring a whole other set of pain.
[11:04:27] <ashgotti> this has been a 1.5 year long project with lots of pain
[11:04:37] <ashgotti> we're almost done so there is some light at the end of the tunnel
[11:04:38] <duch_kazatel> basically, the plugin is attaching itself to one version, and the other is coming along and saying "lolno"
[11:04:44] <ashgotti> haha lolno
[11:04:57] <drej> yeah, noconflicting it is not the way to go
[11:05:07] <duch_kazatel> not in this case, at least.
[11:05:16] <duch_kazatel> since you're building from the ground up, especially.
[11:06:17] <drej> duch_kazatel supposedly*
[11:06:18] <drej> :)
[11:06:24] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha]
[11:06:53] <ashgotti> definitely not from teh ground up. It's Drupal + a bunch of modules + a bunch of overrides = a disaster
[11:07:01] <ashgotti> oh and 1.5 years
[11:07:01] <duch_kazatel> then there you go.
[11:07:07] <duch_kazatel> multiple versions of jquery will kill you.
[11:08:24] <ashgotti> drupal has a jquery update module that can go from 1.7.1 to 1.10.2. I'm going to give that a try and remove the 1.10.2 that I manually added
[11:08:35] <ashgotti> pray for ash
[11:10:38] <BillCriswell> :-( drupal
[11:10:47] <duch_kazatel> word
[11:11:01] <ashgotti> Drupal is usually :) for me until I have to do something where a module doesn't exist
[11:11:05] <ashgotti> it's just very bloated
[11:13:04] <BPositive> Hi all, I was running into a problem of sending POST requests in parallel. The API rate limits dont allow me to do so. So I came with a recursive solution and now, the second request happens when the first is .done() . You can find the code at: http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/pm_serialize_post . However, the code inside saveHandler() does not work as expected. Please help
[11:26:03] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: I just think it's really user unfriendly.
[11:26:11] <BillCriswell> Enough for me to not want to use it.
[11:26:28] <BillCriswell> Still learning it though because of work and all.
[11:26:40] <ashgotti> BillCriswell: there is a massive learning curve. Once you're over it, you've invested so much time on it you almost have to use it
[11:26:49] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: Haha.
[11:27:12] <BillCriswell> ashgotti: I started playing around with Craft CMS last night and it already makes a lot of sense. Compared to a while with Drupal.
[11:27:33] <naeluh_mon> yo what up !
[11:27:41] <BillCriswell> Ayyy
[11:27:55] <ashgotti> Ok so, I only have on jquery 1.10.2 declaration (drupal's not my manual one) and it breaks jquery mobile and I still get the same errors. When I add it again manually, jquery mobile works but I get the same errors. le sigh
[11:28:00] <naeluh_tues> anyone ever use gif.js ?
[11:28:29] <BillCriswell> I haven't.

[11:59:21] <nezZario> I have a pretty large number of inputs
[11:59:44] <nezZario> Is it better to use add a class to a bunch of inputs and use that class to select or use the startswith selector?
[11:59:58] <duch_kazatel> berpcor http://jsfiddle.net/nXm9N/1/
[12:00:00] <nezZario> im using e.x. foo[X] foo[Y] foo[Z]... as the names
[12:00:04] <duch_kazatel> it's working, just no visible difference.
[12:00:11] <duch_kazatel> nezZario add the class.
[12:00:29] <nezZario> kind of disappointed jquery doesn't know to work on them as arrays :)
[12:00:43] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:00:58] <tuskkk___> What are API wrappers?
[12:00:58] <tehopeologist> hey all
[12:01:00] <duch_kazatel> nezZario those wouldn't be like arrays.
[12:01:10] <duch_kazatel> tuskkk___ something that wraps an api to abstract out something even further.
[12:01:12] <tehopeologist> anyone ever have any issue with closing modals using jqueryui's modal system?
[12:01:21] <nezZario> well they end up as arrays in php, is all (i know it has nothing to do with that)
[12:01:28] <nezZario> just would be convienent
[12:01:30] <tuskkk___> like node.js wrapper for mandrill API
[12:01:33] <tehopeologist> for some reason my element that's used to close the modal doesn't work when pressing it in iOS safari =/
[12:01:38] <tuskkk___> Ok
[12:01:43] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: How is that possible? I change one color to another...
[12:02:26] <duch_kazatel> nezZario not sure what you mean
[12:02:33] <duch_kazatel> you can create an object of those yourself instead.
[12:02:41] <duch_kazatel> berpcor look at your web inspector.
[12:04:23] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: Absolutely nothing happens...
[12:04:39] <duch_kazatel> berpcor i'm seeing the css get applied to the element.
[12:04:46] <duch_kazatel> things are getting overridden as well.
[12:06:21] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: I do something wrong, probably. I can't see any changes...
[12:06:55] <duch_kazatel> i can't help atm.  but play around with your css ;)
[12:07:02] <duch_kazatel> also you want $(this), not this
[12:07:16] <PerlWebDev> I see the CSS changes, but I don't see how the animation is getting attached to the object
[12:07:59] <berpcor> Strange for me... Such a simple thing... doesn't work...
[12:11:11] <jessica583> how can i check  if exists at the same time as removing the matching elements selected by $('#adiv' > ul:contains('astring')
[12:11:20] <jessica583> )
[12:14:30] <berpcor> Some more ideas?..
[12:16:33] <NoiseEee> jessica583: hmmm?
[12:17:44] <berpcor> Shit... I need extra plugin for color manipulations. Jquery can't do it by default.
[12:17:45] <shoky> berpcor: to animate colors you need the jquery.color plugin  (or jquery UI if you want that)
[12:17:52] <berpcor> )
[12:18:16] <berpcor> Yes, I've just found out that )
[12:18:26] <berpcor> Thanks, anyway.
[12:38:37] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I'm so dumb
[12:39:05] <ashgotti> so besides the duplicate and mismatched versions of jquery, the version of jquery.cookie drupal uses and that I was using does not have the removeCookie function…of course it couldn't find it.
[12:39:24] <ashgotti> Now I'm using the full version jquery.cookie and the cookie gets created and deleted as it should.
[12:41:52] <ashgotti> The only problem is that I don't know if I've set up the cookie correctly. My logic is - If cookie exists, do nothing. If cookie doesn't exist, create one and show a popup. If the kiosk is idle for 5 min, delete the cookie and go to the front page. The problem is that when I navigate to another page and come back to the front page, it doesn't do the "if cookie exists, do nothing." Instead it shows the popup
[12:42:39] <ashgotti> This is the code I have: http://jsfiddle.net/L8vLu/9/
[12:58:46] <pedda> i'm trying to put two forms on a page and submit those via ajax
[12:59:14] <pedda> both forms work on page A, but fail on page B
[13:00:02] <pedda> when i inspect the xhr request in webinspector the result looks different
[13:01:29] <pedda> fyi.. i'm ruberducking ;)
[13:01:40] <pedda> *rubber ducking
[13:08:06] <Cyclohexane> Why does parentsUntil() only seem to go as far as 1 parent?
[13:09:33] <ashgotti> Anyone have any ideas why jquery mobile doesn't see a cookie if I'm navigating the site using the "back" button but if I refresh, it sees the cookie and acts accordingly to what I've setup?
[13:19:57] <puchacz> hi, I have search results as div
[13:20:24] <puchacz> when user clicks on something on a search result, it disappears: hide("scale", {percent: 0}, 500)
[13:20:34] <puchacz> but then the remaining results jump up
[13:20:39] <puchacz> can I animate them up?
[13:21:02] <duch_lunch> puchacz sure - you have a few choices.
[13:21:22] <duch_lunch> the easiest would be to change the animation on the result you're removing to drop its height to 0.
[13:21:36] <puchacz> duch_lunch: I like it
[13:21:58] <puchacz> what would the command look like?
[13:22:01] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, you could hide the inside of that container using your above method, and then animate the height of the container.
[13:22:07] <duch_kazatel> the command?
[13:22:17] <duch_kazatel> oh, the code?
[13:22:22] <puchacz> yes, please
[13:22:35] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:23:50] <duch_kazatel> you'll animate the height property using that.
[13:24:22] <puchacz> duch_lunch, duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:27:53] <jessica583> if i have a div containing text 'myloltext: 1' how can i extract only the number from it and no whitespace?
[13:28:06] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 parseInt() or parseFloat()
[13:28:29] <duch_kazatel> depending on what the number will be.
[13:28:50] <Jattenalle> split it at the : ?
[13:29:10] <jessica583> duch_kazatel: ty, Jattenalle yeah that's what i had in mind but i'll try parseint first
[13:29:25] <__joshua___> 'myloltext: 1'.split().pop() | 0
[13:29:47] <duch_kazatel> tons of choices.
[13:30:38] <Jattenalle> [insert overengineered regex answer here]
[13:31:09] <duch_kazatel> that might be appropriate depending on the range of numbers.
[13:31:26] <Jattenalle> given the example, i dont think this is too advanced a use scenario
[13:31:36] <duch_kazatel> prolly.
[13:32:32] <__joshua___> as you wish  'myloltext: 1'.match(/[^\d]+(\d+)/).pop()
[13:32:40] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> just :(
[13:34:03] <guideX> hey guys, is it possible to make a table-cell scroll vertically with jquery
[13:34:16] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:34:26] <Jattenalle> yes
[13:34:28] <guideX> well I have this issue.. http://jsfiddle.net/jV6B9/
[13:34:37] <duch_kazatel> woahdang
[13:34:40] <guideX> in firefox only, the table-cell scrollbar doesn't appear
[13:34:50] <guideX> I was hoping there's a jquery workaround
[13:34:55] <duch_kazatel> wtf is that first bit.
[13:35:08] <guideX> what this?
[13:35:09] <guideX>   <div id="columns"></div>
[13:35:24] <Jattenalle> lol
[13:35:29] <duch_kazatel> no the js.
[13:35:42] <guideX> ah this is the hcolumns library
[13:35:51] <duch_kazatel> just link the plugin via the external resources thinger instead.
[13:36:09] <duch_kazatel> and btw none of these are table cells.
[13:36:10] <guideX> http://hax4.in/plugins/hColumns/
[13:36:12] <Jattenalle> i dont understand the issue
[13:36:38] <Jattenalle> i got scrollbars just fine in firefox, not sure what you mean though, since that jsfiddle is broken
[13:36:42] <guideX> there's a display: table and display: table-cell (on the left menu thing), when you make it too small veritcally, the scroll bar doesn't appear in firefox
[13:36:48] <guideX> oh hmm
[13:36:52] <guideX> broken how?
[13:37:04] <Jattenalle> well, i guess i'm just not sure what i'm looking at
[13:37:09] <Jattenalle> or looking for rather
[13:37:18] <guideX> it's like a mac file explorer basically
[13:37:25] <guideX> except in a webpage
[13:37:26] <duch_kazatel> okay, what's broken in the example?
[13:37:35] <guideX> well with firefox, the vertical scroll bar doesn't appear
[13:37:43] <guideX> on the menu on the left side
[13:37:48] <guideX> so click on "blah3"
[13:38:04] <guideX> just to get an idea of what this does..
[13:38:13] <guideX> so then try in firefox to resize vertically
[13:38:15] <Jattenalle> i get vertical scroll bars :/
[13:38:17] <jessica583> __joshua___:  $(x.split().pop() | 0) ?
[13:38:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah because the height property is set to 100%
[13:38:24] <duch_kazatel> it'll never work correctly.
[13:38:32] <guideX> jattenalle: in firefox?
[13:38:34] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 no.  just useparseint or parsefloat
[13:38:41] <__joshua___> jessica583: why add $(...)?
[13:38:46] <guideX> duch_kazatel: what would you recommend?
[13:38:53] <guideX> maybe redo it with regular tables eh?
[13:38:54] <__joshua___> [].filter.call('myloltext: 1', function(c){ return c.charCodeAt(0) < 58 && c.charCodeAt(0) > 47; }).join() | 0;
[13:38:56] <__joshua___> mahahaha
[13:38:58] <guideX> err regular divs
[13:38:58] <Jattenalle> guideX, http://i.imgur.com/kLTPJL6.png *shrugs*
[13:39:00] <jessica583> lol
[13:39:13] <guideX> well yes, but make the browser smaller
[13:39:14] <duch_kazatel> guideX ... wat?  just set a height.
[13:39:21] <guideX> so you can't see  blah11
[13:39:27] <__joshua___> duch_kazatel: you can't use parseInt unless the string starts with a number
[13:39:33] <guideX> then the vertical scroll bar should appear, but it doesn't
[13:39:43] <Jattenalle> oh, yeah what duch_kazatel said
[13:39:53] <guideX> ah hmm
[13:40:00] <guideX> so set the height with jquery perhaps?
[13:40:07] <duch_kazatel> with css.
[13:40:08] <Jattenalle> also
[13:40:10] <Jattenalle> overflow hidden
[13:40:27] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ you're right.  derp derp.
[13:40:40] <guideX> but if I set the height, and resize the browser, the height doesn't change
[13:40:50] <drej> why are you setting a height
[13:40:52] <guideX> for instance, I get a scrollbar if I set the height to 200, but it doesn't resize with the page
[13:40:53] <duch_kazatel> guideX right - your css is all kinds of wrong.
[13:40:59] <Jattenalle> guideX, overflow is hidden, it'll never scroll
[13:41:04] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[13:41:07] <guideX> oh hmm
[13:41:26] <Jattenalle> the CSS is all kinds of weird and conflicting
[13:41:34] <Jattenalle> you have hidden on parent elements, and then scroll on the child ones
[13:41:35] <Jattenalle> :/
[13:41:37] <jessica583> getting NaN for parseInt($('#divname > ul > li:contains(' + $title[index[i]] + ')').text());
[13:41:44] <jessica583> :(
[13:41:47] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 yeah because it starts with a number.
[13:41:49] <Jattenalle> jessica583, split at the :
[13:41:52] <duch_kazatel> err, doesn't start with a numbder.
[13:42:16] <guideX> to be honest the css and js is all like a library, i'm just trying to figure out how to fix the firefox scrolling issue.. works fine in chrome
[13:42:23] <guideX> and other browsers
[13:42:33] <guideX> I didn't write any of it heh
[13:42:38] <Jattenalle> it works in chrome because chrome says: This is retarded, I'm going to ignore it.
[13:42:39] <duch_kazatel> guideX does this break outside of jsfiddle?
[13:42:54] <duch_kazatel> because you're going to have all kinds of fun problems with that.
[13:42:54] <Jattenalle> that jsfiddle will shouldnt work properly
[13:43:00] <Jattenalle> -will
[13:43:05] <guideX> jsfiddle is working for me with this
[13:43:13] <guideX> unless you mean the scrolling problem
[13:43:25] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[13:43:29] <Jattenalle> well that is the issue we're discussing..
[13:43:38] <guideX> ah ok .. it breaks outside of jsfiddle yes
[13:43:44] <guideX> but it also breaks in jsfiddle for me
[13:43:48] <Jattenalle> yeah because the CSS is broken
[13:43:48] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:43:57] <Jattenalle> or the HTML is using the CSS wrong
[13:43:59] <Jattenalle> whichever
[13:44:14] <jessica583> Jattenalle: what do you mean split at the : ?
[13:44:29] <guideX> suggestions?
[13:44:43] <guideX> i'm not really sure what to do lol, i've tried a lot of stuff
[13:44:47] <Jattenalle> jessica583, var whatever = parseInt(something.split(':')[1]);
[13:44:53] <guideX> maybe it's time to give up on this lib and just make my own?
[13:45:03] <duch_kazatel> that'll probably be the best.
[13:45:19] <duch_kazatel> because that CSS is all kinds of terrible.
[13:46:46] <Jattenalle> js> parseInt('sillystring: 5'.split(':')[1]);
[13:46:50] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[13:46:56] <Jattenalle> oh, right, it dun broke
[13:48:02] <jessica583> projectCommentSum += parseInt($('#new-comments-notification > ul > li:contains(' + $projectTitle[differentValueIndexes[i]] + ')').text().split(':')[1]);
[13:48:09] <puchacz_> I tried to animate up my search result, but it leaves mess on the page: http://jsfiddle.net/WR2y5/1/
[13:48:11] <jessica583> NaN ...
[13:48:14] <puchacz_> pls help
[13:48:18] <jessica583> pls
[13:48:42] <Jattenalle> jessica583, you should check your results
[13:48:53] <Jattenalle> does $('#new-comments-notification > ul > li:contains(' + $projectTitle[differentValueIndexes[i]] + ')') actually contain anything?
[13:49:18] <guideX> so any idea aside from rewrite?
[13:49:19] <Jattenalle> is there a : in the text at all? and such
[13:49:20] <Jattenalle> sanitize
[13:50:14] <jessica583> Jattenalle: checking
[13:50:39] <__joshua___> jessica583: http://jsfiddle.net/7mfNN/3/
[13:52:14] <puchacz_> duch_lunch, duch_kazatel: can you guys pls have a look at my fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/WR2y5/1/ I tried to do what you suggested but it does not work
[13:52:24] <duch_kazatel> puchacz thgat's one person...
[13:52:25] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:52:38] <puchacz_> on my chrome it leaves the h1.
[13:52:39] <puchacz_> ha!
[13:52:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking broseph
[13:52:44] <puchacz_> you got me
[13:53:53] <Jattenalle> puchacz, you're using animate wrong
[13:54:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah...
[13:54:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/WR2y5/6/
[13:54:34] <jphase> WEEEEEEEEEE
[13:54:34] <Jattenalle> http://jsfiddle.net/WR2y5/7/
[13:54:43] <Jattenalle> heh
[13:54:51] <duch_kazatel> there's also my version :)
[13:54:54] <fcn> what just happened?
[13:54:58] <duch_kazatel> netsplit
[13:55:04] <puchacz_> thanks!
[13:55:31] <Jattenalle> .animate( properties, options ) as seen http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:55:33] <puchacz_> thanks Jatenalle and duch_kazatel
[13:55:56] <duch_kazatel> there's also .animate(properties, duration, complete)
[13:56:01] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[13:56:31] <puchacz_> I should use webstorms, I think it would show me that I am typing wrong arguments
[13:56:45] <Jattenalle> aye, i just stuck with the method he was already, kind of, using :P
[13:57:02] <duch_kazatel> puchacz_ eh, maybe not.  submlime text can do that, too.
[13:57:10] <duch_kazatel> but your case was a simple mistake in formatting.
[13:57:28] <puchacz_> also, should I remove() or just hide()?
[13:57:33] <puchacz_> and does it matter?
[13:57:42] <duch_kazatel> will you be showing it again?
[13:57:46] <puchacz_> no
[13:57:50] <duch_kazatel> then .remove()\
[13:57:54] <Jattenalle> .remove() = gone forever
[13:57:54] <puchacz_> ok, thx
[13:58:01] <duch_kazatel> that takes it completely out of the document, which is what you want.
[13:58:02] <Jattenalle> .hide() = not visible, can be brought back
[13:58:44] <puchacz_> ok
[13:58:54] <puchacz_> hide() = like manipulating css to hide it
[13:59:16] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what .hide() does
[14:00:49] <jessica583> __joshua___: ty for fiddle
[14:01:17] <__joshua___> i didnt actually check result.  lemme know if anything weird happens.
[14:02:46] <duch_kazatel> wtf our regex for validating URL format includes ftp
[14:03:08] <Jattenalle> well it is a valid url
[14:03:19] <__joshua___> sure is
[14:03:22] <guideX> what about something like this? will this help my cause? http://www.tablefixedheader.com/demonstration/
[14:03:46] <duch_kazatel> oh, use case is relevant here: this is a signup form for a special program for contractors.
[14:03:54] <__joshua___> fix headers are a nightmare that keeps me up at night
[14:04:24] <puchacz_> sublime text looks like modernised emacs :-)
[14:04:29] <puchacz_> (I use emacs)
[14:04:33] <duch_kazatel> closer to vi actually.
[14:04:37] <jessica583> so console.log('#div').text()) outputs project A: 1
[14:04:40] <puchacz_> never heard of sublime text before
[14:05:06] <jessica583> but parseInt($('#div').text()) gives NaN
[14:05:17] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 yeah because it doesn't start with a number.
[14:05:20] <Jattenalle> jessica583, told you use split
[14:05:22] <duch_kazatel> puchacz_ ST is pretty popular.
[14:05:25] <jessica583> ooou
[14:05:33] <Jattenalle> parseInt($('#div').text().split(':')[1])
[14:05:41] <Jattenalle> just make sure .text() actually has a : in it
[14:05:50] <jessica583> Jattenalle: ok
[14:09:13] <jessica583> yuuuuuuuuuussss
[14:09:19] <jessica583> ty for help.
[14:09:21] <jessica583> got it
[14:16:03] <benlieb> why does $('selector').first() return an array?
[14:16:46] <Jattenalle> benlieb, consistency
[14:17:14] <benlieb> Jattenalle: how so?
[14:17:24] <Jattenalle> $(selector) = array
[14:17:25] <duch_kazatel> almost everything else returns an array.
[14:17:32] <Jattenalle> $(selector).narrow() = array
[14:17:34] <duch_kazatel> *array like object, rather.
[14:18:02] <Jattenalle> otherwise you'd have a few .narrow() methods that returned something different than all other ones
[14:18:05] <Jattenalle> and it'd be a pain
[14:18:18] <duch_kazatel> makes things easier
[14:18:29] <benlieb> but the whole point of first() is usually to get a unit, not a group of units. ruby doesn't seem to have a problem with that.
[14:19:06] <benlieb> so first() returns an array_like thing with one thing in it?
[14:19:15] <Jattenalle> benlieb, by the same logic $('#something') should not return the same type as $('.something')
[14:19:17] <duch_kazatel> yep.  just like the jquery selector canm
[14:19:19] <duch_kazatel> *ca
[14:19:22] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[14:19:31] <Jattenalle> also, what if $('.something') is a single item? should it return a single item then?
[14:19:35] <Jattenalle> and only array when it's multiple?
[14:19:37] <Jattenalle> etc
[14:19:38] <Jattenalle> messy
[14:19:40] <Jattenalle> silly.
[14:19:59] <duch_kazatel> that's just the nature of the jquery object.
[14:20:05] <benlieb> Jattenalle: .class by deff is assumed to potentially have multiple things
[14:20:07] <benlieb> # is not
[14:20:22] <duch_kazatel> benlieb but they're all jQuery objects.
[14:20:30] <duch_kazatel> that's the other distinction.
[14:20:34] <benlieb> actually returning a single thing from $('#id') would enforce good markup
[14:20:37] <duch_kazatel> that allows you do generally not have to worry about it.
[14:20:45] <Jattenalle> consistency trumps
[14:21:17] <benlieb> Jattenalle: again, MANY other popular languages get by without this so-called consistency
[14:21:26] <Jattenalle> so?
[14:21:28] <duch_kazatel> benlieb thankfully jquery isn't a language.
[14:21:30] <Jattenalle> use them instead then...
[14:21:37] <Jattenalle> i dont see the relevance
[14:21:53] <Jattenalle> make a fork of jquery and make it behave however you want, go for it
[14:21:56] <benlieb> Jattenalle: um, JS works in the browser. and jQuery is a framework not a language
[14:21:57] <duch_kazatel> benlieb when has it been a problem for you?
[14:22:06] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library, not a framework.
[14:22:17] <Jattenalle> benlieb, ok, now you're just being a cunt.. you're the one who brought up other languages. have a good day sir.
[14:22:34] <__joshua___> are you guys debating the merits of jquery objects always being array-like?  very handy, imo
[14:22:35] <duch_kazatel> i'd still like to see a case when it actually matters.
[14:22:47] <duch_kazatel> rather, when it causes problems.
[14:22:52] <Jattenalle> __joshua___, yup, consistency is nice :)
[14:23:31] <duch_kazatel> especially when the underlying methods abstract that bit out for you.
[14:24:14] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, clearly you dont get it! RUBY doesnt abstract that away and RUBY is sexy, so jquery is wrong! it's also a car.
[14:24:15] <Jattenalle> ;)
[14:24:16] <benlieb> duch_kazatel: i don't know if it's a problem, but it's not very intuitive coming from languages where you can actually "get at" the object
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> benlieb you can "get at" objects via jquery just fine.
[14:24:57] <duch_kazatel> jquery abstracts it out so you can do things like use .css() without checking to see if you should enumerate instead.
[14:25:20] <duch_kazatel> javascript does it similarly to the way you're describing.  jquery makes it easier imo.
[14:25:30] <__joshua___> otherwise you would be writing .each(function(){ $(this).. every couple of lines
[14:25:37] <duch_kazatel> right.
[14:27:48] <benlieb> duch_kazatel: fair enough. It just feels strange to me to call a method on an array_like object and have that loop internally by default EVERY time.
[14:28:02] <duch_kazatel> it only loops if it needs to.
[14:28:28] <duch_kazatel> i can see why that might "feel" awkward, but it makes a lot of sense.
[14:29:31] <duch_kazatel> if you want it your way, don't use jquery.
[14:29:41] <Jattenalle> ^^
[14:30:29] <__joshua___> jq is getting less and less relevant.  (still, i often import it for its sugar)
[14:31:46] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:31:57] <duch_kazatel> why do you say its less relevant?
[14:32:19] <benlieb> __joshua___: I agree
[14:32:27] <ornerymoose> How would I return the second value here ('filterDelivered'). I tried this.value.get(1) but that gave me an undefined error: http://jsfiddle.net/DJyj6/
[14:32:28] <__joshua___> broken promises (heh), querySelector
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> promises was a big mistake.
[14:33:12] <duch_kazatel> but i think it'll fill a different niche in the future.
[14:33:13] <benlieb> jq and other "libraries / frameworks / dsls" largely developed to regularize browser inconsistencies which are less severe all of the time.
[14:33:32] <duch_kazatel> benlieb sure, unless you have to support IE 8+
[14:33:43] <__joshua___> promises big mistake?  you mean cause jq missed half the point?
[14:33:59] <duch_kazatel> the implementation was, i mean.
[14:34:06] <__joshua___> right
[14:34:50] <benlieb> oddly, and this is why I think of jQ as not just a library but something more, because it actually changes the way you interact with the language. for example my balking at always getting an arraything
[14:35:02] <yaymukund> is there a good way to detect support for transitionend using jquery?
[14:35:15] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:35:20] <duch_kazatel> benlieb that's a little unfair imo.
[14:36:16] <duch_kazatel> if I don't have jquery available, I know to pay attention to things like that.  but i appreciate having it there.
[14:36:52] <yaymukund> I know how to do .on('transitionend webkitTransitionEnd...') but that doesn't handle the case where it's nto supported at all
[14:38:18] <duch_kazatel> yaymukund http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19635986/easy-way-to-detect-support-for-transitionend-event-without-frameworks-like-jquer this should have some good info.
[14:41:06] <yaymukund> duch_kazatel: ah, okay. yeah, I've looked at that but was hoping jQuery would have some weird little magic property :p
[14:41:13] <yaymukund> thank you
[14:41:29] <duch_kazatel> yaymukund not that i'm aware of, but i could be wrong.
[15:14:40] <cmw72> How would I go about employing a selector where the start of the name attribute matches multiple strings?   For instance ...
[15:14:41] <cmw72> $( 'input[name^="custom_"]' ).change() and $( 'input[name^="max_"]' ).change() both perform the same action.
[15:14:41] <cmw72> Can I have one selector that triggers for both?
[15:15:32] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[15:19:33] <__joshua___> $(parent).on(eventtype, actualtarget, handler);
[15:19:58] <cmw72> nevermind ... $( 'input[name^="max"], input[name^="custom"]' ).change(...) did the trick
[15:20:03] <duch_kazatel> you can use more than one selector at a time, too.
[15:28:40] <Mokstar> I just discovered that North Korea's web designers use JQuery
[15:28:59] <Mokstar> or, jQuery, if you prefer
[15:29:16] <Mokstar> just came to share that
[15:29:24] <Mokstar> Excelsior!
[15:32:10] <duch_kazatel> far out
[15:32:49] <Tomashe> Hey guys maybe that a silly question but maybe someone can help me understand how can i merge 2 objects that contain objects into 1 object that contain ALL objects
[15:33:17] <__joshua___> whats the structure?
[15:33:36] <__joshua___> but you probably just want http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[15:34:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah use extend.
[15:34:48] <Tomashe> let me read
[15:34:49] <Tomashe> :)
[15:35:05] <Tomashe> var object = $.extend({}, object1, object2);
[15:35:09] <Tomashe> seems good :)
[15:39:42] <sweet2k4> hi guys, is it possible to hide all element with a specific class using the .hide() function? http://jsbin.com/vigenota/1/edit
[15:39:54] <jphase> $('.yourclass').hide();
[15:40:56] <jphase> sweet2k4: class"box"    is bunk... class="box"    ;)
[15:41:25] <sweet2k4> ahh i see, thats why!
[15:41:35] <sweet2k4> jphase: thanks
[15:41:50] <jphase> np, thx for providing code samples with your question :)
[15:42:29] <sweet2k4> seams like i have to get everything correct for it to work ;)
[15:42:40] <jphase> silly syntax
[15:42:54] <sweet2k4> yea :)
[15:46:33] <sweet2k4> lets say i want to hide all elements and show one, this would be the eisest way of doing it? (besides hiding only 3 of the 4 elemets) http://jsbin.com/vigenota/1/edit
[15:48:49] <sweet2k4> another question, if someone has tried out edge reflow you would know that all elements gets the class "clearfix" what does that class do?
[15:49:15] <antlong_> anyone know of a plugin for easily setting z-indexs and such, im looking to layer images, for example, like creating a car, the engine would be under the hood
[15:52:11] <__joshua___> should need a plugin
[15:52:13] <__joshua___> shouldn't
[15:52:28] <__joshua___> $(asdf).css('z-index', x);
[15:52:59] <antlong_> i have a lot of images though
[15:53:16] <antlong_> i can do it manually, but incase things change i figured it would be easier if something existed to handle this
[15:54:17] <__joshua___> $('img').each(function() { $(this).css('z-index', $(this).data('mydataattributez')) });
[15:54:44] <guideX> I fixed it, http://jsfiddle.net/jV6B9/1/ ... ultimately was fixed with display: -moz-box;
[15:54:45] <__joshua___> but seriously, how do you store you current idea of 'z-index'?
[15:54:54] <antlong_> we're implementing it now
[15:55:04] <antlong_> essentially we're building an object out of its underlying components
[15:55:28] <antlong_> wheels > motor > body > windshield
[15:55:37] <antlong_> like that, but much finer
[15:55:37] <__joshua___> there are 1000s of ways to do it,  none of them should need a plugin
[15:55:47] <__joshua___> ok cool.  you could create a tree
[15:55:58] <__joshua___> traverse the tree while setting z indexes
[15:56:11] <antlong_> can i get some pseudocode
[15:57:20] <styol> Hey there. Is there any way to proxy an element to a different DOM? As in, accomplishing the same thing that $('#element', differentDom) accomplishes without having to explicitly specify a differentDom as part of the jQuery selection. The reason is an element on the page is being moved to a different DOM on a custom platform and I'd like to not change the original source code, if possible.
[15:58:35] <styol> maybe some sort of override that attempts to find the element in differentDom if it can't find it in the present DOM?
[15:58:35] <sweet2k4> jphase: just a quick question. if im about to use a jquery script inside an html document without including an external file. would i write the script within <script> ... </script> tags?
[15:58:44] <__joshua___> traverse(node, counter){  $(this.node.el).css('z-index', counter');  (this.node.children || []).forEach(function(child){ traverse(child, counter+1); }); };
[15:59:00] <jphase> sweet2k4: yep
[15:59:22] <antlong_> __joshua___ do i need to explicitly set an order for the pieces then?
[15:59:48] <sweet2k4> jphase: hmm thought so. doesnt seam to work tho. i have to examine the code again, thx
[16:00:02] <__joshua___> tree looks like {el: '#engine', children: [{el: '#chasis'}, {el: '#wheels', children: [{el: '#hubcap'}]]}
[16:01:44] <antlong_> __joshua___ perfect, thanks
[16:01:48] <styol> This is kind of funny because I know it sounds like I'm trying to do some hack type of thing, but it is for legitimate purposes
[16:06:16] <jazzycool> hey guys I got a little bug in this javascript code
[16:06:23] <jazzycool> can you guys tell me what
[16:06:41] <duch_kazatel> not if you don't show us.
[16:07:14] <jazzycool> http://pastebin.com/8iW7wNwR
[16:07:16] <jazzycool> here is the code
[16:07:23] <jazzycool> I m trying to reverse my name
[16:07:32] <jazzycool> and I m doing this on codecademy
[16:07:43] <jazzycool> but it gives me a weird output
[16:07:46] <jphase> jazzycool: so you just want to reverse the string?
[16:08:25] <duch_kazatel> that prints out each char in reverse order.
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> also do for (var j = name.length; j >= 0; j--){ instead of that 5 thing.
[16:10:12] <jazzycool_> hey sorry I got disconnected for some reason
[16:10:14] <jazzycool_> but I am back
[16:10:26] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting to happen?
[16:10:50] <jazzycool_> ok so it should print nimiaj
[16:10:54] <sweet2k4> jphase: im sorry if im distracting you but it would be okay to write the script tags within the head tag right?
[16:11:16] <jphase> sweet2k4: that's fine, but typically you want your js before your </body> tag
[16:11:20] <jazzycool_> you know the revesrse of what is in the array
[16:11:32] <duch_kazatel> jazzycool_ okay.  this effectively does that.
[16:11:45] <duch_kazatel> unless you want a single string to be printed out, instead of each character.
[16:12:24] <jazzycool_> well but for me on the codecademy console it gives me this output which I thought was pretty weird http://pastebin.com/Qb1FrD1p
[16:12:38] <sweet2k4> jphase: yea it was long time ago i did work with html and jquery im trying to isloate the problem im having, cant figure out whats wrong..
[16:12:51] <duch_kazatel> jazzycool_ then the data you supplied doesn't match what they have.
[16:12:56] <duch_kazatel> that means you have mixed quotes going on.
[16:13:04] <jazzycool_> meaning
[16:13:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Wd7QL/
[16:13:15] <jphase> sweet2k4: post a jsbin/jsfiddle
[16:13:38] <duch_kazatel> jazzycool_ meaning var name = ["j","a","i","m","i","n"]; is poorly formatted in your thinger.
[16:13:57] <sweet2k4> jphase: okey, give me a sek to convert my project into that. thanks
[16:13:58] <jphase> hehehehe.... thinger
[16:14:13] <duch_kazatel> dingus.
[16:14:17] <jphase> lol
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> dongle
[16:14:36] <jphase> dongle is by far the best industry term that came out in the last 6 years
[16:14:51] <duch_kazatel> in the last ever I think you mean.
[16:14:57] <jphase> "let's make a usb stick into a porn accessory".... love it
[16:15:35] <jphase> touché... not many things "top a dongle" ;)
[16:15:43] <jazzycool_> lol all I see is a difference is var =name.length and that seems to have solved the problem for some reason
[16:16:45] <duch_kazatel> jazzycool_ your var is busted, but ok.
[16:16:54] <duch_kazatel> jazzycool_ what program are you writing code with?
[16:17:19] <jazzycool_> well just the codecademy console
[16:17:29] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:17:34] <jazzycool_> was learning javascript and tried to be a little fancy
[16:17:49] <jazzycool_> but the name.length solved my problem
[16:17:58] <jazzycool_> thanks for the hlep I highly appreciate it
[16:18:02] <jazzycool_> help*
[16:18:05] <sweet2k4> jphase: its a little bit messy but i think you will understand the code http://jsbin.com/yohegoxa/1/edit
[16:18:32] <sweet2k4> jphase: i just copied the parts from the project
[16:18:34] <jazzycool_> may be its something to do with there configuration for the progamming on their website
[16:18:55] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:19:05] <duch_kazatel> oh and then he leaves :(
[16:19:15] <duch_kazatel> i fear for the future of our industry sometimes.
[16:19:33] <jphase> sweet2k4: if you're going to stick jQuery in a <script> tag up in the head, you'll need to stick that in a document ready wrapper
[16:19:42] <jphase> hence why it's best practice to put before the </body> tag ;)
[16:21:40] <sweet2k4> jphase: i see, now i get something happening, but still its not 100% corret
[16:22:29] <sweet2k4> jphase: i want all divs, Ruta1, Ruta2, Ruta3, Ruta4 to hide, and then show a one of them
[16:22:47] <jphase> post a new jsbin
[16:22:57] <sweet2k4> jphase: And to show a diffirent one depending on what trigger i click
[16:23:23] <sweet2k4> jphase: http://jsbin.com/yohegoxa/1/edit
[16:25:10] <jphase> sweet2k4: k, I don't really understand - are you wanting the top 4 clickable paragraphs to display at all times, and then the items below to only show 1 at a time based on which paragraph is clicked?
[16:25:56] <sweet2k4> jphase: that is correct
[16:26:01] * jphase finds the nearest alcoholic beverage and clinks with duch_kazatel
[16:26:07] <duch_kazatel> weee!
[16:26:12] <jphase> sweet2k4: give me a sec to rewrite this for you then
[16:26:35] <sweet2k4> jphase: okey, thanks a lot man!
[16:31:56] <jphase> sweet2k4: http://jsbin.com/yohegoxa/2/edit
[16:32:07] <jphase> so notice how I'm using the .index() function there
[16:32:20] <jphase> no sense in making a separate click event for each paragraph you click on
[16:32:32] <jphase> they all are relative to which one (0 is the first, 1 is the second, etc.)
[16:33:50] <sweet2k4> jphase: wow, works like a charm.
[16:34:50] <jphase> so now you just need to hide every one but the first with css for your "initial view"
[16:34:55] <sweet2k4> okey so if i ad another paragraph in the rightinfobox it would have number 4?
[16:35:08] <jphase> yeah, but you don't need to modify your jQuery at all :)
[16:35:14] <jphase> just add a <p> and a <div>
[16:35:42] <sweet2k4> i never used .index()before
[16:35:49] <duch_kazatel> why not use delegation instead?
[16:35:52] <duch_kazatel> :B
[16:35:55] <jphase> in fact, you can probably get rid of all the ids and classes except the InfoBoxLeft and InfoBoxRight
[16:36:04] <jphase> well... it was the path of least resistance
[16:36:15] <sweet2k4> that is the function that creates the "numbers"
[16:36:30] <sweet2k4> clearlt, 2 lines of code!
[16:36:44] <sweet2k4> i need to examin it a bit more to fully understad
[16:37:07] <jphase> sweet2k4: just add an    alert($(this).index());  in the click function and it'll make more sense
[16:37:20] <jphase> the :eq()  selector in there just tells it which one to select
[16:37:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm so sick of dealing with this mootools abatement.
[16:37:29] <jphase> :eq(0) is the first one
[16:37:44] <sweet2k4> ok 1 sec
[16:39:00] <sweet2k4> so $(this).index() is giving the number of the div elment i click?
[16:39:06] <jphase> yeah
[16:39:36] <jphase> and :eq is selecting the corresponding element
[16:39:53] <sweet2k4> so if i switch places with the trigger it will show the same text but with a diffirent index number?
[16:40:42] <jphase> not sure what that means exactly, but that code hides all the divs in InfoBoxRight and shows the div that corresponds with the paragraph you clicked
[16:41:07] <sweet2k4> yeah, i think i was a bit unclear in my statement
[16:41:22] <sweet2k4> and $('#InfoBoxRight > div').hide(); hides all the divs withinf rightinfobox
[16:41:44] <jphase> specifically all of the direct child divs
[16:41:47] <jphase> so... not all divs
[16:42:09] <jphase> if there was <div id="InfoBoxRight"> <p><div>blah</div></p> </div>    then blah would still show
[16:42:41] <jphase> #InfoBoxRight > div     means a <div> that's a direct child of id="InfoBoxRight"
[16:43:12] <cobracommand> Is jquery just a javascript/ajax library?
[16:43:19] <jphase> '#InfoBoxRight div'  would be all divs (recursively) inside InfoBoxRight
[16:43:22] <jphase> cobracommand: yep
[16:43:27] <jphase> well, javascript library
[16:43:33] <jphase> has ajax stuffs in it too though sure
[16:44:13] <sweet2k4> okey so #InfoBoxRight > div only points to a child directly under infobox
[16:44:29] <sweet2k4> but not the childdivs of that child
[16:44:36] <jphase> correct
[16:44:38] <sweet2k4> if that makes sens
[16:45:01] <jphase> virtually all selectors in jQuery are the same as the css selectors
[16:45:01] <sweet2k4> okey great, learnt lots of new stuff
[16:45:15] <sweet2k4> one last question tho
[16:45:19] <jphase> so in css....     ul li    = every <li> inside a <ul>
[16:45:41] <sweet2k4> ul > li would select?
[16:45:45] <jphase> meh, nvm, bad example
[16:45:57] <jphase> all <li>'s should be in a <ul> lol
[16:46:05] <sweet2k4> aha
[16:46:05] <tw2113> or an <ol>
[16:46:06] <jphase> but ul > li is a <li> directly under a <ul>
[16:46:08] <jphase> lol
[16:46:16] <sweet2k4> hehe ok well
[16:46:18] <jphase> god... I have one beer and then I word vomit... nvm
[16:46:41] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[16:46:53] <sweet2k4> haha
[16:46:57] <sweet2k4> but
[16:46:59] <sweet2k4> div:eq(' + $(this).index() + ')
[16:47:01] <duch_kazatel> if you nested <ul><li> under an <li>, you wouldn't get the nested ones.
[16:47:06] <sweet2k4> what does the + signs do
[16:47:11] <duch_kazatel> concatenation.
[16:47:15] <duch_kazatel> you're adding a string.
[16:47:19] <jphase> damn you duch with your quick fingers
[16:47:27] <duch_kazatel> data entry bitchezzzzz
[16:47:39] <duch_kazatel> employment ad transcription for years teaches you to type.
[16:47:52] <soc> hi
[16:47:58] <jphase> hai
[16:48:00] <soc> probably a stupid question
[16:48:09] <jphase> nawwwwww doggggg
[16:48:10] <sweet2k4> i see but the spaces before and after the + signs are not needed?
[16:48:21] <soc> I have an extremely small snippet of code which seems to use jquery
[16:48:22] <jphase> sweet2k4: not needed, I just like to see what I'm doing
[16:48:28] <jphase> doing/concatenating
[16:48:32] <duch_kazatel> MUCH more readable that way.
[16:48:36] <duch_kazatel> whitespace is fine.
[16:48:37] <jphase> ^
[16:48:37] <duch_kazatel> use it.
[16:48:41] <soc> I'd like to get rid of that dependency, because I want to move that snippet to a different language
[16:48:54] <soc> here is the snippet: https://gist.github.com/soc/186500f41465a5d97e37
[16:48:57] <sweet2k4> yeah, i was just woundering since it was a string it might be nesseary
[16:49:00] <duch_kazatel> soc that... doesn't make sense
[16:49:02] <soc> can someone help me with that?
[16:49:07] <duch_kazatel> to what language?
[16:49:12] <soc> Scala.js
[16:49:20] <sweet2k4> i mean in a string the spaces would count, or maybe im wrong
[16:49:30] <duch_kazatel> sweet2k4 right, you're not in a string at that point.
[16:49:53] <soc> I tried both JavaScript and TypeScript, but they were both beyond terrible ... Scala.js works perfectly fine, so I'm sticking with that
[16:50:02] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel:  ok let me examin it again
[16:50:15] <duch_kazatel> soc you should learn javascript so you can do these things yourself.
[16:50:22] <duch_kazatel> javascript isn't nearly that bad.
[16:50:23] <jphase> sweet2k4: yeah, ending the '  means the string stops.  so like....    'farts' + something + 'smellsgood'   would be like     fartsDOsmellgood    if something = 'do';
[16:50:25] <soc> so I'd first like to remove the jquery dependency to make it easier to port the javascript to Scala.js
[16:50:40] <jphase> smellsgood*
[16:50:42] <soc> duch_kazatel: my issue is mainly with the $
[16:51:05] <duch_kazatel> soc if you really need to, .resize() is just binding a listener on the resize event.   $("html").css("overflow", "hidden"); is editing some css on the html noe.
[16:51:23] <soc> resize == onresize, ready == onready?
[16:51:25] <duch_kazatel> soc actually your issue is with everything jquery is abstracting away for you.
[16:51:40] <soc> css == setAttribute("style", "...")
[16:51:51] <soc> is that correct?
[16:51:53] <sweet2k4> jphase: yes, i understand the code to 95% now :)
[16:52:10] <duch_kazatel> soc more complicated than that.
[16:52:33] <duch_kazatel> soc the document ready does a LOT of work under the hood to protect you from yourself.
[16:52:47] <sweet2k4> .fadein() us the same as show? but with a fadein animation
[16:52:48] <soc> mhh, ok
[16:53:03] <duch_kazatel> soc take the time to learn javascript.  you'll be surprised i think.
[16:54:12] <soc> I have seen enough to not wanting to touch it ever again
[16:54:23] <duch_kazatel> then don't write frontend code imo
[16:54:29] <duch_kazatel> or use anything that runs with js.
[16:54:39] <sweet2k4> jphase: okey i think i got it all now  + $(this).index() +  could be replace with a number 0-3 (in this case) but then only that div would show
[16:54:40] <duch_kazatel> what don't you like about JS?
[16:54:51] <jphase> sweet2k4: ueaj
[16:54:53] <jphase> whoa...
[16:54:56] <jphase> yeah*
[16:54:58] <jphase> lol
[16:55:08] <soc> I can't even say "x is terrible" ... anything is terrible ... deployment, dependency resolution, productivity, handling errors
[16:55:10] <sweet2k4> haha give me some bear too1
[16:55:24] <duch_kazatel> soc wat
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> soc i think you're convoluting stuff, but ok.
[16:55:53] <sweet2k4> jphase: well thanks a lot for helping me out and teching me some new cool stuff! i have to go to bed now, take care!
[16:55:54] <soc> anyway, it's not about JavaScript ... I'm using something which I think works magnitudes better than JavaScript itself and I'm happy
[16:56:07] <duch_kazatel> that runs on javascript.
[16:56:09] <jphase> sweet2k4: ciao. best of luck
[16:56:47] <soc> duch_kazatel: JavaScript is like assembly ... yes, it's probably the result on my work, but I'm happy that I don't have to touch it
[16:57:31] <duch_kazatel> soc it's really not that bad.  you're going to spend so much more time trying to convert things to satisfy your requirement.
[16:57:39] <duch_kazatel> just seems really strange to me.
[16:58:16] <soc> the scope of what I'm doing is well-defined, so I'm not too worried about that
[16:58:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:59:09] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/ready.js
[16:59:13] <duch_kazatel> start dumpin' through the source then.
[16:59:27] <duch_kazatel> you also need to learn the DOM API, which is probably what you didn't like about javascript.
[17:00:48] <soc> yes, no idea who came up with that API, but types take alot of that pain away
[17:01:11] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[17:01:16] <duch_kazatel> enjoy yourself broseph.
[17:01:31] <soc> it's like they designed that API and said "well, let's design an API which is so horrible that people have to wrap that API in their own wrapper to be able to use it in any meaningful way"
[17:01:43] <soc> SVG viewBox is my favorite example
[17:01:59] <duch_kazatel> this is why a lot of us use jquery
[17:02:09] <soc> or that the DOM API is slightly different than the SVG API
[17:02:31] <soc> duch_kazatel: yes, jquery is taking away a lot of that pain
[17:02:49] <duch_kazatel> so then just use it, learn js, and be happier that you won't have to rewrite a whole bunch of stuff.
[17:03:10] <soc> It's not that I dislike jQuery, but I don't want to have another dependency for 10 lines of code
[17:03:29] <duch_kazatel> you'd rather have a massive dependency for 15?
[17:03:37] <soc> why?
[17:03:48] <duch_kazatel> how big is scala.js?
[17:04:11] <soc> let me check
[17:05:30] <soc> 80kB with tree-shaking and optimization
[17:05:45] <duch_kazatel> okay - now check out all the work jquery does for you for just document ready.
[17:07:01] <soc> lol, that's worse than expected :-)
[17:07:16] <duch_kazatel> right.  so just learn jquery and let it handle all that for you ;)
[17:07:52] <soc> is promise() related to that broken Promises/A+ stuff or is it something different?
[17:08:29] <duch_kazatel> jquery's implementation is not a finer point, but at least it's consistent.  that should also not impact anything in the example you provided.
[17:10:48] <duch_kazatel> i absolutely hate coldfusion, but that doesn't make me add in some crazy dependency just so i'll work on it.
[17:19:54] <Yahkob> If I have any amount of elements all with the same class and all at random coordinates of the body is animate the right method to use if i want to say have all of them ease over to the left side?
[17:21:13] <Yahkob> I was able to get them all to move to the right side just setting their postition at absolute left but they just appear there I just wanted to see if I could make them ease over but havent been able to with animate
[17:24:48] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to get the offset().left of each and the animate that down to 0 and do more voodoo magic.
[17:34:52] <soc> duch_kazatel: I managed to translate the JavaScript snippet to Scala.js while keeping jQuery ... I guess I can live with that
[17:36:04] <duch_kazatel> kay
[17:37:39] <soc> it's unlikely that I have to touch jQuery code itself, so the current situation seems to minimize the danger of having to deal with JavaScript
[17:38:01] <duch_kazatel> how long have you been programming for, out of curiosity?
[17:38:45] <soc> wow, since years I guess ... middle school at least
[17:38:59] <duch_kazatel> interesting
[17:39:17] <duch_kazatel> and how much exposure do you have to JS?  how many years worth?
[17:39:21] <soc> now I'm mostly hacking on compilers and fixing standard libraries
[17:40:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm just surprised your employer would let you create that extra requirement like that.
[17:40:18] <soc> I have first seen it while in school too, but just like PHP it left a really bad taste, and I actively avoided both
[17:40:37] <soc> duch_kazatel: no, I'm not doing any webstuff
[17:40:58] <duch_kazatel> wat.  then what was that snippet for earlier?
[17:41:13] <duch_kazatel> because even our java guys know JS
[17:41:31] <soc> (well, my requirement is that I can assume that if code compiles, that it runs correctly ... both JavaScript and TypeScript seem to be far away from that)
[17:41:49] <soc> well, I know Java, too, but that doesn't mean I want to work with it
[17:42:08] <duch_kazatel> i just don't see where the hate is coming from is all.
[17:42:15] <duch_kazatel> it's not nearly as bad as you're making it out to be.
[17:42:25] <duch_kazatel> sure there are some pretty bad warts, but they're easily mitigated.
[17:42:38] <soc> I'm just designing a presentation with SVG and I needed some language for the interactive parts (panning and zooming to different parts of my vector graphics)
[17:43:18] <soc> duch_kazatel: well, it's not hate ... I just prefer to use tools which seem to be more productive for me
[17:43:35] <duch_kazatel> javascript can be plenty productive, but ok.
[17:43:45] <soc> why would I care about how to migitate warts if I can choose to just not have them at all?
[17:43:57] <duch_kazatel> because it's not that hard to not type certain things.
[17:44:03] <duch_kazatel> you'd like some of what crockford has written.
[17:45:01] <soc> sure, I know the book. I just prefer offloading work to the compiler.
[17:45:09] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:45:47] <soc> if i get tired, I'll make mistakes, the compiler won't :-)
[17:46:13] <gaspyr> aanyone have an idea how to have a local offline copy of MDN ?
[17:46:25] <duch_kazatel> i guess i'm so used to working with JS that's not really a concern any more.
[17:46:31] <duch_kazatel> gaspyr err, why would you do that?
[17:46:50] <gaspyr> i dont have net
[17:47:00] <duch_kazatel> they do a weekly dump at $('<option/>', {
[17:47:00] <duch_kazatel> 					text: validProvinces[i][0],
[17:47:00] <duch_kazatel> 					'value': validProvinces[i][1]
[17:47:00] <duch_kazatel> 				}).appendTo($selectStateOrProvince);
[17:47:02] <duch_kazatel> woops
[17:47:13] <tw2113> bahaha
[17:47:15] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/media/developer.mozilla.org.tar.gz
[17:47:16] <gaspyr> huh
[17:47:17] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[17:47:24] <duch_kazatel> hate mirc sometimes.
[17:47:25] <soc> duch_kazatel: sure. from my POV using JavaScript feels like going back to the middle ages. so for me, it's really a concern, because I don't want to throw away all the tools which keep my code correct.
[17:47:36] <duch_kazatel> soc like what?
[17:47:37] <gaspyr> but the tarball isnt for offline use
[17:47:45] <gaspyr> all links still point to online version
[17:48:01] <gaspyr> do u see the prob :(
[17:48:10] <duch_kazatel> gaspyr then you'll need to write a script that changes that?
[17:48:11] <soc> duch_kazatel: tooling, deployment, dependency resolution, type checking
[17:48:22] <tw2113> don't worry duch_kazatel, i once pasted a copy of jquery in base64 into a chat room
[17:48:29] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 hahahaha nice.
[17:48:41] <gaspyr> what script, and how, ive no idea
[17:48:47] <duch_kazatel> gaspyr one that your write.
[17:49:22] <gaspyr> but ive no idea what script i can write to do this
[17:49:30] <gaspyr> be specific
[17:49:41] <gaspyr> sry to bother u
[17:49:48] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[17:50:01] <duch_kazatel> soc some of that has been handled by the node communityu.
[17:50:11] <duch_kazatel> type checking is nbd to me.
[17:50:34] <soc> yes, I have seen how they tried to handle that. I still have nightmares after seeing it.
[17:50:57] <duch_kazatel> why is that?
[17:52:30] <duch_kazatel> gaspyr there's also this: https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs
[17:52:32] <soc> let's just ignore that the whole idea behind Node.js itself is pretty braindead. Just consider npm: I don't know if it is considered "best practice" or what the hell were they thinking when they provided "-g" for installing stuff globally (as root)
[17:52:51] <duch_kazatel> soc Node.js is a great idea imo.
[17:53:02] <duch_kazatel> not braindead at all.  and -g is for lazy devs.
[17:53:28] <soc> or the whole "install node to get npm. use npm to install tsc. use X to install d.ts files for tsc. etc."
[17:53:37] <soc> or the whole bower stuff
[17:53:38] <duch_kazatel> that's slowly changing.
[17:53:45] <duch_kazatel> bower is one way to solve that problem.
[17:54:10] <duch_kazatel> your problem is that javascript doesn't have a built-in way to solve all of that.
[17:55:19] <soc> no, I just want good tools. not stuff which seems like it was hacked together by some drunk brocoders during a frat party.
[17:55:45] <duch_kazatel> oh okay. well scala is for stuck up pricks with nothing better to do than talk about how their awful ideas "scale" ;)
[17:55:53] <duch_kazatel> oh wait that's an unfair assessment
[17:56:44] <duch_kazatel> sorry to hear you've had such bad experiences either way.
[17:57:37] <soc> yeah ... that IntelliJ TypeScript support was beyond mediocre to say it politely ... not sure if it was the integration, the compiler, or the kind-of-useless typesystem
[17:57:51] <duch_kazatel> typescript is meh.  i don't really see the point.
[17:58:22] <duch_kazatel> it's just like people trying to write MVC using JS - it's not really good at it.
[17:58:41] <soc> if they at least supported "let" ... without it, it's kind of weird ... one gets some kind of typesystem (which tends to keep fighting against the user), but throws away all the sanity let could bring
[17:59:13] <duch_kazatel> let is coming into 1.7
[17:59:35] <soc> i think most browser support i already unofficially"
[17:59:43] <duch_kazatel> kind of.
[17:59:44] <soc> (I only care about firefox, anyway)
[17:59:45] <duch_kazatel> inconsistent.
[17:59:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah FF supports it.
[18:00:10] <duch_kazatel> have to wrap with <script type="application/javascript;version=1.7">
[18:02:49] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i leave.  enjoy folks.
[18:58:52] <antlong_> what do i need to do, to make the accordians inside the crafting panel collapse? http://multiverseminer.com/ click crafting
[19:04:02] <troop> hello, i have a lot of menu item and want to control them via jquery. they must be changeable from one place and so apply to all pages with one edit. whats the name of this technique?
[19:19:06] <antlong_> troop you want a variable
[20:28:07] <il> hello all
[20:57:05] <tiblock> Hi. I need to select ".users .admin" and ".users .moderator" i do ".users .admin, .users .moderator" is that correct way? Or there is something like ".users [.moderator,.admin]"?
[20:57:27] <tiblock> also user "nargas" is spam bot
[20:57:36] <vladikoff> tiblock, how
[20:58:08] <tiblock> vladikoff, how what? selector or bot?
[20:58:16] <vladikoff> tiblock, how is it a bot
[20:58:34] <tiblock> he send me in private "show gratis (solo hooy) --> http://s422803032.mialoj{end of website here}"
[20:59:15] <tiblock> *sent
[21:09:54] <pigggie> Given an object using multiple selector like $('.a, .b, .c'), is there a simple way to get a jquery object, or selector for each individual part of that list?
[21:12:04] <pigggie> eg. [ '.a', '.b', '.c' ]
[21:15:24] <tiblock> pigggie, try this https://api.jquery.com/add/
[21:17:57] <tiblock> pigggie, or you want get [ '.a', '.b', '.c' ] from $('.a, .b, .c') ? Then you can do something like $('.a, .b, .c').selector.split(',') im not sure what you asking really
[21:20:08] <abishek> when looping through $.each is there a way to skip a particular item in the loop and proceed to the next one?
[21:22:10] <jphase> pigggie: you can use .each to loop through them and use $(this)
[21:22:23] <jphase> whoops, just saw that tiblock already answered :x
[21:23:59] <tiblock> abishek, im not sure what you asking, but to skip item just to something like "if(key==2) return;"
[21:24:10] <tiblock> *just do
[21:24:27] <tiblock> oh my hands cant aim keyboard
[21:25:00] <abishek> tiblock: so calling return skips the execution of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration?
[21:25:12] <tiblock> abishek, yep
[21:25:16] <disappearedng_> http://jsfiddle.net/w6rr5/ can anyone tell me why my confim dialog is not showing up?
[21:25:48] <abishek> ok, i was also thinking on the same, but though return would escape the $.each itself. thanx for clarifying
[21:26:11] <tiblock> disappearedng_, .submit its for <form> mot for buttons
[21:26:22] <tiblock> *not
[21:26:24] <tiblock> >_<
[21:26:24] <disappearedng_> Oh
[21:26:39] <disappearedng_> so I should attach click handler on the button"
[21:26:48] <disappearedng_> is that what is best for me?
[21:27:24] <disappearedng_> tiblock: http://jsfiddle.net/w6rr5/1/ like this?
[21:27:26] <tiblock> abishek, "return;" returns undefined, same like just return nothing. Dont do return true/false tho.
[21:27:55] <tiblock> disappearedng_, do ('#order_form').submit
[21:28:00] <abishek> tiblock: understand, thnx
[21:28:26] <pigggie> tiblock: Sorry, I got distracted. Yes the latter is the case (an array of individual selectors within the list).
[21:28:41] <disappearedng_> tiblock: huh, cancelling also submits the form
[21:29:12] <tiblock> disappearedng_, http://jsfiddle.net/w6rr5/2/
[21:29:23] <tiblock> pigggie, $('.a, .b, .c').selector.split(',')
[21:29:49] <tiblock> i didnt know irc is so fun, solve problems, get fun
[21:29:56] <disappearedng_> hm, tiblock yeah that works. Strange how !(confirm works but not the other way
[21:30:19] <tiblock> disappearedng_, when you "return false" in "submit" it cancells submit
[21:30:40] <pigggie> tiblock: thanks, I'll see how that works out.
[21:31:13] <tiblock> does js bot here works with jquery?
[21:31:16] <tiblock> >> a=123;
[21:31:20] <tiblock> >>a=123;
[21:31:26] <pigggie> Oh I just remembered... I think .selector is deprecated :(
[21:31:27] <tiblock> oh, maybe wrong channel
[21:40:21] <tiblock> pigggie, for some reason https://api.jquery.com/selector/ says it is removed in 1.9 but it works in 1.9.1 and 2.1.0 on jsfiddle. Anyway i cant give you other solution than solve this problem by some other way without requesting selectors
[21:42:32] <pigggie> tiblock: Yeah, it does seem like that is the best solution. I'll probably just avoid trying to work around it for now though as it's not critical.
[22:06:42] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:12:00] <jphase> herro
[23:12:44] <serge> I have a stylesheet printed in HEAD "<head><style>body{background-image: url("http://URL.bg/bg.jpg")}</style></head>". How can I get background-image from it?
[23:22:32] <jphase> serge: console.log($('body').css('background-image'));
[23:27:49] <serge> jphase, I'm receiving data with ajax and need to get bg url to replace it without page reload
[23:28:52] <tiblock> serge, $('body').css('background-image', 'url("http://new_url")');
[23:28:52] <jphase> hm?
[23:33:08] <serge> I receive this text "<head><style>body{background-image: url("http://URL.bg/bg.jpg")}</style></head>" by ajax and store it in a variable. I need to get bg url from variable
[23:34:55] <querylous> I have a question about slidown or slidetoggle. Anyone available?
[23:35:23] <jphase> serge: well that's pretty hackish, but at this point your only option is regex
[23:37:58] <serge> jphase, thanks
[23:38:24] <acidjazz> lol serge
[23:38:48] <acidjazz> you dont control the response?
[23:40:39] <Cork> serge: the server isn't handling ajax calls at all if your receiving <head></head> as part of an ajax request
[23:41:09] <Cork> serge: and a better option might be to use an iframe for the full page you get instead
[23:43:24] <serge> Actually I trying to use this plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ajax-page-loader for wordpress to change content without page reload
[23:46:06] <serge> Here is what I receive from server http://pastebin.com/RSMTU7B5 somehow I need to replace bg image in body
