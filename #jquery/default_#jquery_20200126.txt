[09:25:57] <Ced04> hello
[11:55:19] <Tagor> is there a selector for .data()?
[11:56:43] <Tagor> (with a specified value)
[11:57:39] <shoky_> Tagor: no not built-in, but you can use .filter(function() {  .. $(this).data(...) .. })
[11:58:06] <Tagor> thanks

[12:57:09] <robamman2020> I posted a question here before you came

[12:57:52] <desfseefsef> i'm neither a man, nor a woman
[12:58:12] <desfseefsef> robamman2020 source code ?
[12:58:34] <desfseefsef> seem to be encodage error
[12:59:10] <desfseefsef> use utf-8, and try again
[12:59:41] <robamman2020> https://jsfiddle.net/3h80u25w/
[12:59:44] <robamman2020> i used it
[13:00:59] <robamman2020> and i tried also to convert the html to utf-8
[13:01:11] <robamman2020> with and without BOM
[13:01:19] <robamman2020> but nothing helps
[13:01:41] <robamman2020> but i see the characters in chrome->network->response
[13:08:21] <robamman2020> I didn't express myself enough good maybe..... it shows response in chrome network->response correctly
[15:33:43] <jiffe> anyone know something that I can give a list of fixed size items and it will allow me to list them horizontally and page through them if the list exceeds using left/right buttons and preferably w/ animation?
