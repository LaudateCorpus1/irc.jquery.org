[00:21:13] <ClydeSlims> I'm trying to make my wallpaper snap to -100% and then gradually go towards 0% when I click the next button, but it's as if my "noTransition" code isn't getting applied. It's supposed to instantly snap to 0% for translateX but it's not? https://jsfiddle.net/yaeyxyv4/3/
[00:21:44] <ClydeSlims> So basically it should originally be at 100%, then snap to -100%, and then gradually slide to 0% for translateX
[00:37:22] <ClydeSlims> anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[00:45:09] <ClydeSlims> I also tried .css("transition-delay", "0s") but that didn't work either
[01:00:30] <Cork> ClydeSlims: why not just write the animation in css and just add classes instead of overriding it with inline style?
[01:06:22] <ClydeSlims> Cork, I'll try that
[01:06:34] <ClydeSlims> I don't see why this way doesn't work though.
[01:06:48] <Cork> the fix is $(".mainHeader-" + curHeader).height();
[01:07:03] <Cork> currently you do a bunch of updates to css, but they are never drawn
[01:07:14] <Cork> so the no transition is never registered by the browser
[01:07:38] <Cork> .height() forces the browser to reflow the elements and then the transition state is registered
[01:24:03] <Cork> ClydeSlims: i would recommend doing something like this https://jsfiddle.net/yaeyxyv4/4/
[01:24:49] <ClydeSlims> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/yaeyxyv4/5/
[01:24:50] <ClydeSlims> it just snaps
[01:25:18] <Cork> check /4
[01:25:58] <ClydeSlims> ok
[01:26:57] <Cork> ClydeSlims: but like i said before, if you do transition manipulation, you have to snapshot when you want css to register the change https://jsfiddle.net/yaeyxyv4/6/
[01:27:37] <ClydeSlims> oh you just call .height() once
[01:28:00] <Cork> it is a "hack" to force the browser to reflow the page content
[01:28:04] <ClydeSlims> thanks!
[01:28:16] <Cork> it doesn't check the values of elements on every js execution
[01:28:28] <Cork> ClydeSlims: but i still recommend going with the /4/ solution
[01:28:39] <Cork> it will give you much more stable code
[01:28:46] <ClydeSlims> alright. thank you!
[04:56:24] <tool8> How do I prevent the function not to double trigger when keypress 13(enter) or focusout on the element? http://jsfiddle.net/twfh72wd/
[04:57:34] <tool8> also dont want to make key enter to make new line
[06:00:47] <Afr0> Hey guys, need some JS help with a menu item.
[06:01:14] <Afr0> https://kathystable.nueramarketing.com when hovering over the submenu main menu item loose it's background colour
[06:01:23] <Afr0> is there a way to change that with js?
[06:04:22] <localh0st> Afr0: you should do this with CSS
[06:04:42] <Cork> tool8: use the keyup event (also don't use keypress it isn't a standard event)
[06:06:05] <Cork> Afr0: just put the :hover on the li element instead of the a element and it would be solved
[06:06:26] <Cork> meaning li:hover > a {} instead of li > a:hover
[06:10:04] <linurandy> how i load diferent content with ajax in a tab with beforeLoad?
[06:23:44] <Afr0> Thanks Cork: i'll give this a try
[06:46:00] <Cork> linurandy: you can't really load ajax content into a tab
[06:46:36] <Cork> linurandy: you can open a popup, and if the browser opens popups into a tab you can then inject the content into the page body if you load it with about:blank
[06:47:00] <Cork> linurandy: the best option is normally to not use ajax for those cases at all (just plain http requests)
[07:00:14] <linurandy> Cork: when a tabs come create i've a <a url="something/url"> and it create me a tabs with that content, rigth, now i want doing click in some image and reload de content of that tabs
[07:00:50] <Cork> linurandy: then what you want is to use the popup interface
[07:00:52] <linurandy> Cork: or you suggest me that modify de <a> and reload the tabs
[07:00:59] <Cork> then you get a reference to the page and can modify it
[07:01:05] <Cork> you can't
[07:01:30] <Cork> linurandy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open
[07:01:46] <Cork> it will give you back a handle you can use to compunicate with the new window
[08:03:00] <shoky> css border-image where have you been all my life
[08:03:23] <Cork> unnoticed and unused :)
[08:04:05] <shoky> gonna use the sh*t out of it on this phone-app-simulator
[08:57:06] <linurandy> Cork: Can you help me with some example?
[09:01:39] <Cork> linurandy: handle = window.open('url'); $(handle.document).find('#image').attr('src', 'new-url');
[09:01:52] <Cork> linurandy: if i remember correctly that should work
[09:02:07] <Cork> haven't used window.open in 5+ years though so i'm very rusty
[09:03:59] <pokmo> hi
[09:04:01] <pokmo> I'm trying to see how sites like https://stackoverflow.com/ capture clicks. On Chrome's Developer Tools, if `Mouse | click` event listener is set, clicking anywhere on the front page is paused in `jquery.min.js`. `BODY.click` is captured.
[09:04:11] <pokmo> But where is it event listener set in the code? I can't seem to find where the click is set to be listened to.
[09:04:11] <linurandy> Cork: thanks, let me try, I just find it impossible not to be able to update the content I have inside the panel of a tab
[09:04:13] <linurandy>  
[09:04:36] <Cork> linurandy: by tab do you mean a jquery ui tab?
[09:04:45] <Cork> cause that is NOT what i mean by a tab
[09:04:51] <linurandy> Cork: of course my friend
[09:04:56] <Cork> -_-'
[09:05:03] <linurandy> Cork: what??\
[09:05:25] <Cork> then just $('element-containing-the-content').html(newContent)
[09:05:35] <Cork> just select the element and replace the content
[09:05:37] <linurandy> Cork: did you think the browser tab?
[09:05:46] <Cork> as you just said tab, yes
[09:05:55] <linurandy> Cork: sorry
[09:06:45] <linurandy> by that i made the question about beforeLoad
[09:07:15] <Cork> beforeLoad on what?
[09:07:34] <linurandy> Cork: in a jquery ui tab
[09:07:41] <linurandy> Cork: let me explain you
[09:09:28] <linurandy> Cork: i had a tabs thar load some url with content and the when i do click in an image i want reload the content of the active tab
[09:09:30] <Cork> pokmo: sites like that tend to obfuscate the code a lot to make it hard to find things like that
[09:10:05] <Cork> what does that have to do with beforeLoad?
[09:10:19] <Cork> just sounds like you want a click handler on the image
[09:13:31] <linurandy> Cork: yo pense que capturando el evento sobre la imagen  e invocando beforeLoad
[09:13:33] <linurandy>  del tab  podria pasar una url u regenerar el contenido nuevo
[09:13:45] <linurandy> Cork: I thought that capturing the event on the image and invoking BeforeLoad
[09:13:47] <linurandy> Of the tab could pass a URL or regenerate the new content
[09:14:21] <Cork> no, the event is to notify you that ui tabs has done something
[09:14:54] <pokmo> Cork, but i think bootstrap.js does that too
[09:15:02] <linurandy> Cork: and the load iether too
[09:15:05] <pokmo> i can't seem to find where the click is captured there either
[09:15:34] <pokmo> the whole script doesn't call addEventListener()
[09:16:04] <Cork> pokmo: it does
[09:16:14] <Cork> but the function name might be obfuscated
[09:16:17] <pokmo> https://dpaste.de/7KGm
[09:16:33] <pokmo> i don't think it's obfuscated
[09:17:45] <Cork> and what about line 1688 for example?
[09:18:24] <Cork> as i haven't read the code, i only list reasons i've hit my self
[09:18:38] <Cork> but you can't react to user action without somewhere calling addEventListener
[09:19:38] <Cork> and obfuscated doesn't have to mean an unreadable function name, it might just be 500 levels deep or so on
[09:20:20] <pokmo> Cork, but even after obfuscation, wouldn't 'addEventListener" still need to be called explicitly?
[09:20:33] <Cork> depends
[09:21:42] <Cork> the code might be "generated" in lack of better words when the script loads
[09:21:56] <Cork> this is commonly used when hard compressing or obfuscating script files
[09:25:32] <Cork> pokmo: an example https://jsfiddle.net/s9k0m9mx/
[09:25:45] <Cork> no addEventListerer, but it can handle clicks
[09:27:41] <Cork> pokmo: only way to securely break down sites like that is with the debugger and breakpoins/stepping
[09:27:53] <pokmo> hmm
[09:28:55] <pokmo> Cork, how does that snippet work?
[09:29:14] <thykka> ew
[09:29:14] <Cork> cause it has the code function bind(event, func) { document.addEventListener(event, func); }
[09:29:23] <Cork> just obfuscated
[09:29:39] <Cork> thykka: ya, there is a reason why i didn't say how i did it :)
[09:29:42] <pokmo> yeah, that clearly obfuscated 'addEventListener'
[09:29:51] <pokmo> so in the end, it still gets called
[09:29:57] <Cork> sure
[09:30:48] <thykka> it's ironic that people who obfuscate their code, are still using open-source tools to write and obfuscate it :P
[09:31:30] <Cork> i find the entire thing utterly stupid, but ya, ppl still do it
[09:31:57] <Cork> pokmo: this might explain what happens to you https://jsfiddle.net/s9k0m9mx/1/
[09:32:30] <pokmo> Cork, but bootstrap.js doesn't have the hex
[09:32:32] <Cork> the obfuscator i used isn't one of the stronger ones
[09:32:45] <Cork> pokmo: there are hundreds of ways to do this
[09:33:16] <Cork> the code you used constructed an object and something else in another lib is checking those keys
[09:33:24] <Cork> and so on and so on
[09:34:02] <thykka> it's like, what or from whom exactly are they trying to protect their code?
[09:34:09] <Cork> i've broken down sites that don't want you to know how it works a lot, so i know there are a ton of ways they do it
[09:34:29] <Cork> thykka: mostely the ceo wanting to protect there IP :/
[09:34:41] <thykka> their IP being a website frontend component? :P
[09:34:53] <Cork> or small developers wanting to lock in the customer so they have to go to them to get fixes for the site
[09:35:07] <Cork> thykka: the functionality of the website ya
[09:35:16] <Cork> *anything* the've written
[09:35:39] <thykka> beh.. if it runs client-side, it's not really protection. If it runs server-side, there's no need to obfuscate in the first place
[09:35:48] <Cork> sure
[09:36:20] <Cork> but this is normally not to completely protect the code, it is to make it hard enough for the target area they care about to be able to charge for it
[09:36:24] <thykka> it's like those js-things that "prevent" the user from copying an image, but making a popup on right clikc
[09:36:28] <Cork> at least that is the most common reason i've seen
[09:36:33] <Cork> ya
[09:36:39] <thykka> or a blank transparent gif in front of the image
[09:36:50] <Cork> or from opening view source; that was quite common about 15 years ago
[09:37:02] <thykka> or those news website paywalls that can be circumvented with minor local DOM changes
[09:37:14] <Cork> heh
[09:37:43] <thykka> so i guess "good enough" coupled with some ignorance is the key here? :P
[09:39:32] <Cork> thykka: basically ya
[09:40:18] <Cork> the one that has frighten me a lot for quite a while that luckely haven't happened YET is sites using EME to do it
[09:40:25] <Cork> cause then you're just screwed
[09:41:23] <Cork> webassembler might also be a problem, never debugged a site obfuscated with webasm
[09:49:42] <thykka> right. EME is fucked up
[09:53:02] <undefined_bob> is it possible to create a script which select a div by its class and by a various index, read the name of the div, on click create an anchor for that div labeled with the previously read name and write that anchor into the html?
[09:59:51] <totallyserious> https://jsfiddle.net/hw826mpy/ how can I make the text appear above the overlay?
[10:06:21] <thykka> totallyserious, this? https://jsfiddle.net/hw826mpy/2/
[10:08:10] <jak2000> and blinking?
[10:16:06] <Tesagk> So many channels! Still picking up JQuery, and I'm obviously making a more fundamental mistake here, but I can't figure it out. When I click on one of the buttons, all of the content hides. Excellent. However, the content linked to that button should be visible immediately afterward, and that doesn't happen.
[10:16:18] <Tesagk> I think I might need to add arguments to .click, but I'm not sure: https://gist.github.com/Chamenas/7efeef5c5c4c42a5431d2d88aa973990
[10:16:33] <Tesagk> There's the HTML and the JQuery bit is in a separate file, so I've placed it at the bottom.
[10:21:58] <Tesagk> Trying something.
[10:26:19] <Tesagk> And, nope. My solution didn't work. Tried to see if I could pass the event handler in the click() function, but I can't use it, event remains undefined for some reason.
[10:27:12] <taplar> Tesagk: make a fiddle please, rather than just a gist
[10:27:45] <taplar> however line 184 is invalid
[10:28:02] <taplar> if you include a script with a <script src=""> tag, you don't put script inside the tag
[10:28:07] <taplar> it's an either or thing
[10:28:26] <Tesagk> Bah. Everyone hates pastebin. Can't use gist here. :P
[10:28:40] <Tesagk> Thank you, that was a question I had earlier in the week that I couldn't find an answer to.
[10:28:49] <taplar> it's easier for us to debug something like a fiddle or a codepen that is a working example of the issue
[10:28:52] <Tesagk> Tho, at the moment, it's a relic of the previous way I was trying to handle the tabs.
[10:29:48] <taplar> also there are times we ask people to make a fiddle that they find their problem in the process of doing so, which can be beneficial too.
[10:30:12] <Cork> heh you mean it is very often the case :)
[10:30:21] <taplar> shssssss
[10:30:33] <pokmo> is it common for sites to generate most of the HTML etc. using jquery?
[10:30:35] <Tesagk> Going to take me a little bit to set it up in fiddle.
[10:30:48] <taplar> pokmo:  i would say no
[10:30:59] <taplar> that's not what it's meant for
[10:31:13] <Cork> depends on the site; to be honest most site still don't relay on js
[10:31:35] <taplar> ^ unless you're talking about ads, imo, heh
[10:31:53] <Cork> or sites that feel they have to be hype
[10:32:03] <Cork> they tend to go more screw you if you don't use js
[10:32:49] <taplar> i was actually kinda impressed the other day in regards to ads.  i usually hate ads, but I ran across some website.  I don't think it was reuters, but maybe it was
[10:32:55] <pokmo> well i'm looking at Foursquare's page https://foursquare.com/pcrepairsc
[10:33:01] <taplar> but you know they had that overlay about cookies being required and what not
[10:33:01] <pokmo> it has a script like https://dpaste.de/Ra6r
[10:33:15] <taplar> and I was like, fk that, and tried to get rid of their stuff manually.
[10:33:21] <pokmo> does it look like that script generates most of the HTML?
[10:33:28] <taplar> site actually was just a blured picture of the real content.  i couldn't get to it.  lol
[10:33:39] <Cork> taplar: lol ouch
[10:34:52] <Tesagk> I thought JS was a big part of HTML5?
[10:34:55] <Cork> pokmo: i wouldn't say it generates most, it looks like it has template for interactions
[10:35:03] <Tesagk> What are websites generating their HTML with?
[10:35:09] <taplar> html?
[10:35:15] <taplar> lol, static files are still a thing
[10:35:31] <Cork> Tesagk: html5 ya, as in the marketing term; the standard sites use is html :)
[10:35:32] <pokmo> Cork, hmm how come you think it has templates?
[10:35:34] <taplar> and the question wasn't do any sites build their content with js, but if the majority of sites do
[10:35:42] <Tesagk> :P
[10:35:45] <Cork> pokmo: templates. <--
[10:35:58] <Tesagk> Yes, I was asking a follow-up question
[10:38:47] <Tesagk> https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/
[10:39:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/1/ included jquery
[10:39:34] <taplar> so what's the question?
[10:41:11] <taplar> side note, line 14 could use the remove() method on the classList
[10:41:22] <Cork> (and you have a lot of broken html)
[10:41:37] <Cork> ex. <i><b></i></b>
[10:42:15] <taplar> true, you should see fiddle highlighting tags.  those are showing you syntax errors in the html
[10:42:26] <Tesagk> Hmm
[10:43:03] <Tesagk> So, I actually need to dump openTab() was part of that old method. Sec.
[10:44:41] <taplar> also line 24, you should pass in the event to the handler.  not all browsers make the event a global.
[10:44:51] <pokmo> Cork, but aren't the templates in the script itself?
[10:44:57] <Tesagk> Fixed the broken HTML, that was embarrassing. Anyways, I should be able to click on any of the left nav buttons and see the associated content.
[10:45:03] <pokmo> so the whole page seems to be generated in jquery
[10:45:15] <Cork> pokmo: sure and?
[10:45:35] <Cork> Tesagk: updated link please :)
[10:45:45] <taplar> ^ beat me to it
[10:45:58] <pokmo> is it a clever idea to generate the whole page in jquery though?
[10:46:09] <pokmo> could it save the server resources?
[10:46:15] <taplar> that's pretty opinionated question
[10:46:17] <Cork> pokmo: from what you showed it isn't whole page
[10:46:24] <pokmo> Cork, is it not?
[10:46:33] <Cork> it has reactions to use actions
[10:46:49] <Cork> from what i skimmed through it is notifications for states and things like that
[10:46:56] <Tesagk> Cork: Sorry, not used to jfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/2/
[10:47:07] <taplar> pushing the page creation to the client can save the server processing, however you are relying on the user to be able to do that processing themselves.
[10:47:39] <Cork> and much more pressing it lowers response time, so you get a much more responsive ui
[10:47:57] <taplar> Tesagk:  did you see my comment about the event variable?
[10:48:23] <taplar> also why is evt not scoped to the handler?
[10:48:38] <Cork> and what is target.id, there is no id on the buttons
[10:48:50] <Tesagk> Sorry, I missed it. I'm trying to pass the event, but screwing it up somehow
[10:49:05] <Cork> Tesagk: function(event) {}
[10:49:09] <Tesagk> Oh, that's right, it got changed to data-attr
[10:49:49] <Cork> ok, in that case i would also point out $(".content#" + evt) should be $("#" + evt)
[10:49:57] <Tesagk> Which was at the suggestion of whomever helped me with the JQuery example the other day.
[10:50:04] <Cork> no point to first select all .content elements to then mapp them to an unique id
[10:50:07] <taplar> cause you can't repeat ids
[10:50:14] <taplar> the link and the content can't have the same id
[10:50:25] <Tesagk> Right.
[10:50:43] <Tesagk> However, since it's data-attr
[10:51:03] <taplar> yeah i was just stating why someone suggested you do that most likely
[10:51:24] <Tesagk>     var evt = event.target.data-attr
[10:51:25] <Tesagk> ?
[10:51:35] <taplar> $(event.target).data('attr')
[10:51:48] <Tesagk> Oh
[10:51:56] <taplar> or event.target.getAttribute('data-attr')
[10:52:05] <jak2000> like me last..
[10:52:09] <Cork> Tesagk: so what you want is https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/3/
[10:53:19] <Tesagk> Hmm. That's a lot more complicated than I thought. Nevertheless, I still learn best by diving in.
[10:54:13] <Cork> actually you don't need the event variable so https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/4/
[10:55:02] <Cork> (hate that so many make an equal sign between this and event.target, they are not the same thing)
[10:55:40] <Tesagk> Well, thanks. I'll try my best to learn from this and such.
[10:55:51] <Tesagk> Now I just need to make an onLoad one :P
[10:56:14] <Cork> Tesagk: i would actually recommend doing that server side
[10:56:22] <Cork> instead of rendering wrong and fixing with js
[10:56:28] <Tesagk> Hmm?
[10:56:39] * Tesagk blinks, "How?"
[10:57:24] <taplar> make a 'hide' class or something, put it on the contents that you don't want show on page load
[10:57:36] <taplar> then your logic changes from show/hide to add/remove that class
[10:57:43] <Cork> Tesagk: https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/5/
[10:57:44] <taplar> and the default one will show on page load without any scripting
[10:57:53] <Cork> just set the "active" class on the one you want
[10:58:18] <taplar> cork went the inverse, :D
[10:59:02] <Cork> ya, habbit of "class should describe a state, not a action"
[10:59:09] <Cork> *an action
[10:59:27] <Cork> and it means you only need to mark one :)
[10:59:35] <taplar> it makes sense to from the markup standpoint, limiting touch points
[11:00:19] <taplar> you could do the selector on .content.active too
[11:00:27] <Cork> yup
[11:00:53] <Cork> you could also make a more centralized structure where you control what page is shown from the main element
[11:01:06] <Cork> (ex <main data-show="Home">)
[11:01:12] <Tesagk> It feels like CSS has changed so much since when I initially learned it... a decade or so ago.
[11:01:17] <Tesagk> Which makes sense, but sheesh.
[11:01:31] <Cork> Tesagk: you should see what comes down the spec pipeline :)
[11:01:39] <Cork> this will seam like childs play :D
[11:01:49] <taplar> Tesagk: the more the css can do, the less the javascript engine has to do, :)
[11:02:01] <Cork> the slower the browser engines get...
[11:02:16] <taplar> is that a thing being seen?  *really doesn't know*
[11:02:24] <Tesagk> Hey, I'm all for it.
[11:02:34] <Cork> somewhat
[11:02:41] <Uhkis> Cork: how much are you loving the new firefox?
[11:02:51] <Tesagk> Didn't firefox update its browser engine?
[11:03:02] <Cork> but the point is ppl tend to forget there is a cost that actually matters
[11:03:06] <Cork> Tesagk: ya
[11:03:09] <Cork> quantum
[11:03:21] <Cork> based largely on the servo experimentation
[11:03:24] <Uhkis> yeah, it's the best by far now
[11:03:46] <Cork> well it is paralized to the wazoo so not that strange
[11:03:59] <Cork> switched from firefox about a year ago though
[11:04:25] <Cork> as they killed the extention environment i left
[11:04:54] <taplar> hmm, usually when i think of css processing vs js processing i usually think of the benefits that the rendering can have over the js making the incremental changes.  never really thought about it starting to slow that process.
[11:05:41] <Cork> taplar: there are several features that browser vendors has said blank no to cause it would slow them to a crawl
[11:06:00] <Cork> some features they have just had to swallow even though it sucks for performance
[11:06:21] <taplar> out of curiosity, where do you go to find literature on these kinds of things?
[11:06:31] <Cork> taplar: csswg
[11:07:29] <Cork> taplar: ex. https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues
[11:07:57] <Cork> what will put every thing on the head though is houdini
[11:08:08] <Cork> it will let sites extend css with javascript :)
[11:08:29] <taplar> huh
[11:08:35] <Cork> oh wait sorry no hodini is the animation api
[11:08:39] <Cork> damn what was it called...
[11:09:14] <taplar> i'm going to have to start trolling this site when i get some time.  this stuff interests me
[11:09:33] <Cork> ya, been following the mailing list since about 2011
[11:09:44] <Cork> they moved to github about a year ago
[11:10:22] <Cork> gah can't find the name of the project for extending css...
[11:10:59] <Tesagk> So, uh... this is weird. I copy + pastaed the recent fiddle, bit easier to read and learn from my notepad window than fiddle, uploaded to server. And... http://tesagk.com/index2.html doesn't work right, but the fiddle does. (Click on any button other than home)
[11:11:26] <srg> Hi. I'm trying to put a string containing html tags into a <p>. Like this: https://jsfiddle.net/9abvpprx/ (forgive me, I'm not familiar with jsfiddle much). It seems that the html is being printed instead of parsed
[11:11:40] <Cork> Tesagk: wrap the content of script.js in $(function() {});
[11:11:46] <Cork> and it will work
[11:12:10] <Cork> Tesagk: jsfiddle wrapps the script section in a onload event by default, that is why you get the effect difference
[11:12:22] <Tesagk> Oh. Definitely going to need to find a good JQuery resource. I have a couple of sites that give me info on the new CSS stuff
[11:12:47] <Cork> Tesagk: jquery resource?
[11:13:03] <Uhkis> api.jquery.com :P
[11:13:14] <Cork> learn.jquery.com and api.jquery.com and blog.jquery.com would be my suggestions
[11:15:06] <qwebirc1789> Is there a sort of tutorial on the API site?
[11:15:33] <qwebirc1789> <- Tesagk, apparently closing browser and logging off of other computer didn't free up the name
[11:18:15] <theRealTesagk> Also had to move computers before I could make the proper change for wrapping it. Since we're not testing anything, is this what you were saying? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3356e7260c6e8c76f964cc75f385ac87
[11:21:44] <Tesagk> Forgot a ) > . >
[11:24:53] <Tesagk> Fantastic. Got it to work, except for Almos. So I need to see what's different about that. Thank you for the help.
[11:30:09] <Tesagk> I think I know what's wrong, but I need a link to that fiddle again cause I'm on a different computer. If you would be so kind.
[11:31:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/j1j8gaps/5/
[11:32:38] <taplar> srg: text() will put the string to the page as a TextNode, which will not render html.  use html() instead
[11:33:24] <taplar> srg: though your fiddle had some syntax errors in the javascript
[11:35:18] <srg> taplar: Thanks! I saw the quote errors and fixed them after, sorry
[11:37:17] <Tesagk> taplar: is that in the css?
[11:37:26] <Tesagk> Oh, different person.
[11:39:12] <Tesagk> I can get rid of the onclick stuff, since openTab() no longer exists.
[11:39:25] <Tesagk> But the Almos section appears to be formatted the same as everything else
[11:40:04] <Tesagk> Oh, nope. _ instead of -
[11:42:45] <Tesagk> Am I able to do this: $('.navTab' & '.navLinks').on('click', '.tabLink', function() { ?
[11:42:56] <Tesagk> Or do I need to make a whole separate function thingy for navLinks
[11:43:01] <taplar> are you familiar with css selectors?
[11:43:41] <Tesagk> Nope, but I can google it
[11:43:52] <taplar> you use commas for an or conditoinal
[11:44:23] <Tesagk> Inside the quotes. Gotcha
[11:44:26] <taplar> '.navTab, .navLinks' would find navTab elements and navLinks elements
[11:44:51] <taplar> #id
[11:44:56] <taplar> .class
[11:45:04] <taplar> 'selector1, selector2' <- OR
[11:45:14] <taplar> 'selector1selector2' <- AND
[11:45:31] * Tesagk nods, "Gotcha. Thanks :)"
[11:45:48] <taplar> 'selector1 selector2' <- selector2 is a(n indirect) child of selector1
[11:46:23] <taplar> 'selector1 > selector2' <- selector is a direct child of selector1
[11:47:40] <Tesagk> I prob have a lot of unnecessary CSS. I'm good at overcomplicating things.
[11:47:57] <Tesagk> But that's good info to know.
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[16:12:26] * taplar dances around
[16:17:54] <buzzluigiyear> Why when I click my inner div does the whole .mainWidget div fade out despite calling event.stopPropagation() ? https://jsfiddle.net/epkkpLxL/3/
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> your selector is bad.
[16:18:26] <robertmaxrees> should be .mainWidget
[16:20:06] <buzzluigiyear> thanks :S
[17:13:10] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:13:30] <taplar> bonjour
[17:15:08] <gambl0re> is robert here?
[17:15:22] <taplar> he died
[17:15:28] <taplar> straight up died
[17:15:38] <gambl0re> wtf...why would you even say something like that. it's not even funny
[17:15:49] <taplar> kinda is
[19:10:21] <paracusia> hello, does anyone know a gallery script like Tremula, where the images appear like on a tabledesk? https://github.com/garris/TremulaJS
[19:12:03] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just use Tremula?
[19:15:28] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[19:18:25] <kof> Hi i cant make safari to open new window   var openWindow = window.open(); openWindow.location.href = 'preview.php';
[19:18:39] <kof> anyone know how to fix it
[19:18:46] <kof> its a Ajax call
[19:20:00] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!
[19:21:24] <robertmaxrees> kof what does it do instead?
[19:21:26] <robertmaxrees> a new tab?
[19:21:31] <robertmaxrees> or nothing at all?
[19:21:45] <kof> yes a new tab
[19:21:51] <robertmaxrees> that's user controlled
[19:22:16] <kof> safari blocks popups by default
[19:22:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:22:23] <kof> cant make it work
[19:22:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:22:53] <robertmaxrees> looks like ##javascript is already helping you out though :)
[19:28:59] <jak2000> robertmaxrees accept a bootstrap/css here ?
[19:30:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 there are already dedicated channels for both of those :) you'll probably have more just in those.
[19:39:06] <robertmaxrees> erm, "just"
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> *should have been "luck"
[20:03:21] <paracusia> found a few, if someone is interested: https://www.jqueryscript.net/tags.php?/Polaroid%20gallery/
[20:15:25] <robertmaxrees> so confused hahaha
[20:55:11] <Eduardo_> how can I target a radio button group that has the 'required' property?
[20:59:50] <robertmaxrees> Eduardo_ can you give them a class?
[20:59:57] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that's gonna be a little cleaner.
[21:01:24] <Eduardo_> well, I might have more than one group
[21:02:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what classes are for :)
[21:02:26] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can target by property, but generally you want to use classes instead since otherwise it's kind of a pain
[21:02:50] <Eduardo_> I could do class="required" I suppose
[21:03:09] <Eduardo_> but I still need to get only the radio button groups with that class
[21:03:21] <robertmaxrees> you could make the class specific to those radio groups.
[21:03:28] <robertmaxrees> then it's just a simple class selector.
[21:04:06] <Eduardo_> what would be the "complex" way you mentioned before? :-)
[21:04:31] <robertmaxrees> an attribute selector, which is hard to read.
[21:04:44] <Eduardo_> I am trying to make it a bit generic
[21:04:48] <robertmaxrees> or a filter on all radios using an attribute selector, which suffers from a similar problem.
[21:04:55] <robertmaxrees> or filter with a function, which incurs some funky overhead.
[21:05:17] <robertmaxrees> classes are great because they help describe the markup a bit.
[21:05:28] <robertmaxrees> makes things easier to read overall, reducing later headaches when trying to fix bugs.
[21:08:39] <robertmaxrees> though now i'
[21:08:43] <robertmaxrees> *i'm curious
[21:08:50] <robertmaxrees> what makes a class non-generic?
