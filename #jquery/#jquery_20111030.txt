[00:07:29] <amanthakur> I am trying to select all INPUT having title by using $('input[title]') but it is not selecting the SELECT. Any idea how do I select all INPUT having title attribute set ?
[01:18:25] <Dieterbe> Hi guys, i have a picture with some people on it, i want to provide the user a nice looking method to get info about those people. i was thinking if the user hovers over the image, when the cursor is on a person, that person is "hilighted" and a popup appears which vanishes again if the cursor leaves the person
[01:18:41] <Dieterbe> how would i do this, or which terms should i google for?
[01:19:34] <ICO_II> how can i remove multiple urls from a text ? basically i want to leave only the first link and remove all the other links starting with http
[01:20:44] <jrockjiggz> how do you jump to the top of the page? $('html').scrollTop(); isn't working for me
[01:24:40] <Tobsn> can i find out which element the parent is? <div class="row"><span>row 1</span></div><div class="row"><span>row 2</span></div> $('.row span').click(function(){ var parentrowid = $(this),parents('.row').SOMETHING(); }); - the nth number of that row class would be nice
[01:39:31] <lime> can i with jquery detect wether an <audio> element is 'playing' or 'paused' ?
[01:54:02] <razamatan> so i have $(this).parent().find('input'), but i have repeated input buttons that have the same name (the values differ).  the jquery object mentioned also contains various other input key/val pairs but aren't named the same thing as the button.  how can i write a filter that prunes out all the other button objects of the same name but keep the one that was clicked?
[01:54:37] <jrockjiggz> $('input:clicked')
[01:54:46] <jrockjiggz> haha jk
[01:55:00] <razamatan> heh
[01:55:32] <razamatan> so basically, teh set of input elements which include the button that was clicked and all the other inputs that aren't buttons of the same name as the one that was clicked
[01:57:15] <jrockjiggz> well .click( function(){  var $clicked = $(this);  var $otherz = $( $(this) ).not('[name='+$(this).attr('name')+']' ); }); tias
[01:58:09] <dabear> $(this).parent().find('input').not(this)
[01:58:42] <dabear> hm, maybe I misunderstood your question
[01:59:42] <razamatan> dabear: yeah.. i have 3 input buttons that all share the same name but have different values... i only want to keep the one that was clicked, and with that one, add all the other input elements to pass along to an ajax call
[02:00:06] <razamatan> hmmm
[02:00:11] <razamatan> would something like this work?
[02:00:13] <Cork[home]> jrockjiggz: uh... $( $(this) ) ??
[02:00:21] <Cork[home]> thats kinda waisfull :)
[02:00:26] <jrockjiggz> should've been $('input')
[02:00:28] <Cork[home]> *waist
[02:00:55] <razamatan> $(this).parent().find('input').not('input[name="sharedname"]').add(this) ?
[02:01:48] <dabear> that should work, yes
[02:04:12] <razamatan> dabear: oh yeah!  verified it works.. :)
[02:27:12] <dabear> wow
[02:27:20] <dabear> so jsfiddle supports coffee now!

[02:44:26] <dwarder> is CDN realy faster than minifying it and giving it as a one file?
[02:45:05] <jrockjiggz> yes
[02:47:41] <jrockjiggz> users not physically near your server will be able to download jQuery faster than if you force them to download it from your arbitrarily located server.
[02:48:13] <jrockjiggz> CDN eliminates one request to your site, allowing more of your local content to downloaded in parallel.
[02:49:01] <jrockjiggz> and browser can trust that those files truly are identical and won't waste time re-requesting the file if it's already cached.
[02:59:37] <dwarder> jrockjiggz: thanks, but have you checked it?
[03:00:03] <dwarder> jrockjiggz: which one do you use
[03:28:55] <eternity13> I got table row like this: <tr><td><a href="link">fancy</a></td><td>data</td></tr> when i click link it opens fancybox. how do i trigger the link when i click anywhere on the row, so it also opens fancybox?
[03:30:51] <ravenzz> make the link wide as the row is
[03:33:31] <eternity13> not really wise
[03:35:11] <ravenzz> why not
[03:41:46] <sean`> eternity13, $('tr').bind ('click', function () { var $this = $(this), $a = $this.find ('a'); $a.trigger ('click'); });
[03:54:40] <eternity13> whoops. that made my browser freeze :D it had a lot of rows
[03:55:39] <ravenzz> man if your js is broken you would to have the entire row clickable as well
[03:55:41] <ravenzz> i suppose..
[03:55:48] <ravenzz> go for the css solution
[03:56:48] <eternity13> i'm thinking of assigning unique id to every row and every link, than just trigger by id
[04:08:06] <eternity13> clicking anchor also triggers tr bind so it causes infinite loop
[04:12:15] <eternity13> <tr id="row1"><td><a id="link1" href="x1">open</a></td></tr> // $('#row1').bind('click', function () { $(#link1).trigger('click'); });  // why does this goes into infinite loop if i click on the row or link.
[04:13:47] <Dirkos> I have a formatting on the jquery autocomplete but somehow it only works on the 1st input element.
[04:13:47] <Dirkos> http://jsfiddle.net/Uvvtg/
[04:22:00] <dabear> eternity13: because if you click a sub element, the parent element will also get clicked
[04:22:21] <dabear> might wanna use triggerhandler instead

[05:21:14] <dabear> explorer 7 came with vista?
[05:21:22] <minna> I know it may be off-topic, but i don't know where else to ask.

[05:54:02] <timing> Hi Guys!
[05:54:54] <timing> Whn I do fadeIn() the, opacity is set with style="opacity: 1;", how do I remove that style? Becuase another classname change on that same element should change opacity too, but this style overrides it

[06:33:33] <timing> mengu: do you know upfront which part is in the <a> and which part isnt?
[06:35:24] <mengu> timing: i don't. in this case, i would need to remove the <a> element. however if i knew that upfront, i'd like to know what would differ.
[06:49:01] <mengu> timing: any ideas?
[06:49:58] <timing> mengu: it's hard to solve I think
[06:50:27] <mengu> timing: that's a deal breaker for me, right now :)
[06:50:34] <timing> you have to check what is in the <a> first then replace that part separately and then replace the surroundings minus the text in the <a>
[06:50:54] <timing> I think you want to keep the <a>?
[06:50:57] <timing> or doe you want to remove that?
[06:51:25] <mengu> i want both scenarios. sometimes we have to pay the cost :)
[06:54:24] <timing> mengu: what is the purpose of the replace?
[06:54:33] <timing> are you making a webbased text editor?

[08:39:48] <SoulRaven> any ideea a variabile from $.ajax {success: } is been populated on the secound call of ajax?
[08:41:02] <dabear> SoulRaven: try reformulating your question
[08:41:08] <dabear> that just doesn't make sense
[08:41:17] <SoulRaven> i have this script, http://bin.cakephp.org/view/919917352 for google maps
[08:41:45] <SoulRaven> and the xmlMarkers is been populated only on the secound call of loadDevices()
[08:42:06] <SoulRaven> in the first is undefined, and in the secound contains the data.responseText
[08:42:28] <dabear> SoulRaven: ajax is async
[08:42:43] <dabear> the return statement is run before the ajax request is completed
[08:43:39] <SoulRaven> i undestand, and how i manage to populate the XMLmarkers in the first run
[08:44:00] <dabear> SoulRaven: best option is to do like this:  function loadDevices(){ return $.ajax(.....
[08:45:01] <dabear> and then do $.when(loadDevices() ).done( function(){   your code that depends on ajax being loaded})
[08:45:07] <Scott0> jstree('open_all'); works from the console, but not in a script tag before the body end tag
[08:45:07] <SoulRaven> i have try like this var xmlMarkers = $.ajax(...... but i can't get the response text from data.responseText
[08:45:16] <Scott0> any ide why it would work one place and not ther other
[08:46:38] <dabear> SoulRaven: $.ajax does not return a response text, it returns a promise that you can use with $.when
[08:47:34] <dabear> SoulRaven: you need to understand that the remote content might not be loaded after doing loadDevices()
[08:47:55] <dabear> $.when and $.ajax helps you with that..
[08:59:09] <emx> i expect .sortable( 'destroy' ) to remove sort functionality. there is no error message i get and the element is still sortable. why?
[08:59:32] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1761549059
[08:59:57] <SoulRaven> i have make the modification, but sill not working, on the secound call is working
[09:04:09] <ryanneufeld> emx: is it possible you're not calling it on the correct sortable?
[09:05:19] <emx> ryanneufeld, no. i have two buttons that make a div sortable and unsortable. i need to click the unsort-button twice to get what i expect with the first click.
[09:05:41] <ryanneufeld> emx: can you paste your code somewhere?
[09:05:51] <emx> ryanneufeld, sure
[09:07:00] <ryanneufeld> ?p

[09:09:24] <cuci> ryanneufeld: yeah it's coffeescript
[09:09:31] <emx> ryanneufeld, i hope i didn't miss anything: http://pastie.org/2783330
[09:09:42] <SoulRaven> any ideea way i can't populate a variabile on the first call using $.ajax?
[09:09:44] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1761549059
[09:09:52] <ryanneufeld> cuci: sorry I don't know coffeescript
[09:10:57] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven:  you
[09:11:08] <SoulRaven> ryanneufeld: me......
[09:11:16] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: returning from within an ajax callback doesn't work that way
[09:11:19] <ryanneufeld> its asyncronous
[09:11:27] <ryanneufeld> so you don't know when the callback is gonna happen
[09:11:49] <ryanneufeld> it's likely that the reason you're seeing it work on the second try is that it's cached by the browser
[09:12:20] <SoulRaven> and how i find out when the callback is ok, and the data from ajax has arrived?
[09:12:38] <ryanneufeld> That's what the callback is for
[09:13:18] <ryanneufeld> when the ajax is .done() or if it fails .fail() it will call the functions passed to it
[09:13:36] <ryanneufeld> emx: this looks incomplete.
[09:14:22] <ryanneufeld> emx: without seeing your code in complete context it's hard for me to help
[09:14:36] <SoulRaven> but i am using done in the code, is not right?
[09:14:42] <ryanneufeld> emx: you could be facing a scope bug or something, can you get it working with jsfiddel
[09:14:51] <SoulRaven> ryanneufeld: $.when(responseXML).done(function(responseText){ xmlMarkers = responseText });
[09:14:56] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: yes, I see that
[09:15:03] <ryanneufeld> but you're returning it
[09:15:12] <ryanneufeld> loadDevices will have returned long before that does
[09:15:32] <ryanneufeld> think about where it's returning to
[09:16:19] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: does that make sense?
[09:17:00] <Mekzholan> I'm using:
[09:17:00] <Mekzholan>  $(this).removeClass('switchUnpressed').addClass('switchPressed').delay(500).removeClass('switchPressed').addClass('switchUnpressed');
[09:17:00] <Mekzholan> but it doesn't work as intended - there's no delay happening. What am I doing wrong here?
[09:17:22] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ Mekzholan
[09:17:23] <bot-t> Mekzholan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:17:42] <SoulRaven> i undestand the reason, but i don't know how to check if the ajax return the data in browser
[09:18:42] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: can you make a jsfiddle with all your js in it? If I can see how you're calling loadDevices, I might be able to help you better
[09:18:52] <ryanneufeld> or if you show me a live example
[09:19:05] <ryanneufeld> ?delay @ Mekzholan
[09:19:06] <bot-t> Mekzholan, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[09:19:27] <SoulRaven> the project is local and the data are on a remote server
[09:19:41] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: okay, then it should work with jsfiddle
[09:19:46] <SoulRaven> i don't have any wrking example
[09:19:49] <emx> ryanneufeld, is there a cdn for jquery-ui?
[09:20:11] <ryanneufeld> um, choose jquery-edge
[09:20:16] <ryanneufeld> and then you can add jquery ui
[09:20:59] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: get what you have setup in jsfiddle and I'll take a look
[09:21:12] <Mekzholan> ryanneufeld: but it isn't delaying...
[09:21:23] <emx> ryanneufeld, got it: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Tqh/ don't let yourself destract from my pseudo text ;)
[09:21:25] <ryanneufeld> Mekzholan: the answer you seek is in the docs
[09:21:56] <ryanneufeld> emx: I think you missed the point of jsfiddle
[09:22:10] <SoulRaven> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/wZT4t/
[09:22:11] <emx> ryanneufeld, find the word "organise" below the php code. that enables the sortable. clicking on "edit" should disable it.
[09:23:03] <emx> ryanneufeld, better? http://jsfiddle.net/U7Tqh/
[09:23:14] <ryanneufeld> no
[09:23:17] <ryanneufeld> sec
[09:23:38] <Mekzholan> ryanneufeld: exacty this doc I've read - and now have read again and again. But I can't find the answer
[09:23:38] <ryanneufeld> emx: like that http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/U7Tqh/1/
[09:23:52] <ryanneufeld> Mekzholan: does it show anywhere that addClass is an effect?
[09:24:17] <ryanneufeld> Mekzholan: "The .delay() method is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects. Because it is limited—it doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delay—.delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases."
[09:24:47] <Mekzholan> it talks about a queue - and isn't appending .doThis().doThat().do... a queue?
[09:24:51] <ryanneufeld> no
[09:25:06] <ryanneufeld> Mekzholan: it's talking about an effects queue
[09:25:30] <ryanneufeld> emx: you need to it the update button so save changes
[09:25:39] <Mekzholan> hm, ok. But then a different question: how do i add/delete a CSS class as an effect?
[09:26:32] <emx> ryanneufeld, i thought i did: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Tqh/2/
[09:26:48] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/wZT4t/3/
[09:26:54] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: I made a comment
[09:27:32] <ryanneufeld> emx: you need to start caching your selectors mate
[09:27:45] <emx> ryanneufeld, what? :)
[09:27:48] <ryanneufeld> emx: also, adding an ID on the body tag is completely useless
[09:29:12] <ryanneufeld> emx: where is your code that ads the sortable, this code is really hard to read
[09:30:33] <ryanneufeld> emx: you can do: var editables = $('.sortable > *')
[09:30:50] <ryanneufeld> once, then you don't need to be traversing the DOM every time you call $('.sortable > *')
[09:30:55] <ryanneufeld> that's called caching
[09:31:04] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: do you see my comment?
[09:31:18] <emx> ryanneufeld, E.units.select.switch.edit and .organise are the suspects
[09:31:32] <SoulRaven> ryanneufeld: yes, i try to update the code based on you comment
[09:32:11] <Dave_Stein> gnarf, you around?
[09:32:20] <emx> ryanneufeld, E.units.text.select.switch.edit / .organis it is
[09:33:47] <ryanneufeld> emx: k, how are they called?
[09:34:42] <SoulRaven> ryanneufeld: is working like this, thx, but is not any solution to populate the variabile or the function to return the value after the ajax is done?
[09:34:45] <ryanneufeld> emx: I'm sorry dude, but your code is just too messy, I can't follow it.
[09:35:00] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: ajax doesn't work that way
[09:35:17] <emx> ryanneufeld, below <?php ?> you see the two words edit and organise. clicking on organise makes .sortable sortable. clicking on edit should revert it.
[09:35:17] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: you gotta start thinking a different way
[09:36:07] <ryanneufeld> emx: looks like you have a draggable/droppable/sortable all in one?
[09:36:14] <ryanneufeld> emx: is that right?
[09:37:03] <emx> ryanneufeld, i don't have a droppable. the draggables are connected to the sortables .sortable
[09:37:19] <emx> well, in this case the sortable is also a droppable
[09:37:20] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:39:43] <JakeSays> how do i encode a + in a url so that it doesnt get converted to a space?
[09:39:51] <ryanneufeld> emx: what is it that you think this line is doing? $( '.sortable > *' ).attr( 'contenteditable', 'true' ).removeClass( 'draggable' );
[09:40:22] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc encodeURIComponent @ JakeSays

[09:40:35] <JakeSays> ryanneufeld: it doesnt encode +
[09:40:49] <scar2> when i  am calling a dialog via $( "#dialog" ).dialog({ show: 'clip' }); --- how do i set the other options of "show" ?
[09:40:49] <ryanneufeld> JakeSays: read all the words, it explains the solution
[09:41:05] <ryanneufeld> emx: is that to make it non-draggable ?
[09:41:26] <emx> ryanneufeld, no, el.sortable( 'destroy' ) should do it.
[09:42:05] <ryanneufeld> emx: why don't you just have an ID on the sortable div
[09:42:18] <emx> ryanneufeld, there will be more than just one.
[09:42:20] <ryanneufeld> then you don't have to traverse the DOM every time you want to find it
[09:42:38] <emx> ryanneufeld, i solved it this way: el.children().attr( 'contenteditable', 'true' ).removeClass( 'draggable' );
[09:42:54] <ryanneufeld> ok
[09:43:09] <cuci> I'm trying to bind a keyup event to an input field like so: http://dpaste.com/644247/. But that only works once, after the first digit the function is not ran anymore
[09:43:12] <cuci> any ideas why?
[09:43:22] <cuci> ryanneufeld: compiled it to js :)
[09:43:35] <ryanneufeld> emx: I say this as constructively as I can, but I hope no one ever has to edit your code when you're done... cause that's a hot mess
[09:43:48] <ryanneufeld> cuci: I will look
[09:44:09] <ryanneufeld> ahh, it's not english.. this might take longer.
[09:44:20] <logik-bomb> $('form input').val().is_it_possible_to_regex_filter_this() ? :) thanks
[09:44:47] <ryanneufeld> cuci: don't do this: return alert(egfr(cnp, creatinina).toFixed(2));
[09:45:22] <ryanneufeld> cuci: return true, or false
[09:45:36] <ryanneufeld> cuci: don't rely on the return of the alert.
[09:45:38] <cuci> just a sec
[09:45:54] <ryanneufeld> logik-bomb: what are you asking?
[09:46:29] <ryanneufeld> logik-bomb: are you asking if you can take the string value from an input from the return of val() and see if it matches a regexp?
[09:46:41] <logik-bomb> ryanneufeld: yes
[09:46:50] <ryanneufeld> can you regexp match on a string?
[09:47:16] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc string @logik-bomb

[09:47:21] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:47:24] <logik-bomb> thanks
[09:48:29] <cuci> ryanneufeld: I tried like so:http://dpaste.com/644248/ but the same thing happens
[09:48:44] <ryanneufeld> cuci: well, dug
[09:48:46] <ryanneufeld> *duh
[09:48:53] <ryanneufeld> you're returning false on a keyup
[09:49:02] <cuci> ryanneufeld: tried true also
[09:49:08] <ryanneufeld> that prevents the keyup from happening
[09:49:26] <ryanneufeld> why are you alerting?
[09:49:34] <ryanneufeld> ?console @ cuci
[09:49:34] <bot-t> cuci, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[09:50:03] <cuci> ryanneufeld: yeah I'm new to debug and this came more inhand
[09:50:15] <ryanneufeld> cuci: learn to use console.log, it's way more useful
[09:50:18] <sorush20> can somone have a look at this http://www.sadafnazari.com/www.rsp2000.com/cosmophobia_pdf.htm and see why there isn't a folder view?
[09:50:44] <sorush20> I have been trying to implement this jquery extension http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
[09:52:08] <cuci> ryanneufeld: yeah and I have some errors there also:http://dpaste.com/644250/
[09:52:29] <ryanneufeld> cuci: well, my guess is that those are related
[09:52:39] <cuci> so the first change yelded the expected result 0.29 the next threw the error
[09:52:51] <cuci> but why did it worked the first time?
[09:52:58] <ryanneufeld> cuci: Uncaught exception: TypeError: 'egfr' is not a function
[09:53:25] <cuci> ryanneufeld: I've seen but the first line is the expected result from egfr
[09:53:34] <cuci> that worked the first digit pressed
[09:54:15] <ryanneufeld> cuci: you're replacing your egfr function
[09:54:19] <ryanneufeld> look at the last line of it
[09:54:28] <ryanneufeld> return egfr =
[09:54:32] <cuci> aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhaaaa
[09:54:37] <cuci> thanks alot
[09:54:40] <cuci> lol
[09:54:44] <ryanneufeld> yup
[09:55:35] <cuci> ryanneufeld: I works man it works
[09:55:56] <ryanneufeld> cuci: and now you've learned the power of the console!
[09:56:01] <ryanneufeld> if you didn't show me those errors
[09:56:09] <ryanneufeld> I might have missed that myself
[09:56:13] <cuci> true true
[09:56:28] <ryanneufeld> well, that's more the power of reading errors
[09:56:32] <ryanneufeld> than the console
[09:56:37] <ryanneufeld> but the console is pretty cool doo
[09:56:45] <ryanneufeld> *too
[09:56:52] <cuci> 80% of the time I asked some js help everybody is aksking well what did the alert var told you
[09:56:52] <ryanneufeld> and everyone should learn to love it
[09:57:00] <cuci> so I picked it up
[09:57:13] <cuci> NO MORE!
[09:57:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah, well, in here, most people will slap your knuckles for using alerts
[09:57:37] <ryanneufeld> at least I will. Alerts intrupt your code execution
[09:57:45] <ryanneufeld> so it's hard to see what's actually going on some times
[09:58:16] <ryanneufeld> like in some cases with an alert, you can 'fix' an ajax issue cause the alert pops up long enough for the ajax to complete
[09:58:33] <emx> does jquery have something that creates a link out of the selected text?
[09:59:34] <ryanneufeld> emx: no
[09:59:40] <emx> ryanneufeld, k, thanks
[09:59:53] <ryanneufeld> emx: you'd need a plugin, or something like tinymce
[10:02:01] <emx> ryanneufeld, tinymce is a no go. all javascript html editors i know, actually. they are all old and not userfriendly.
[10:02:29] <ryanneufeld> emx: k
[10:16:28] <skylamer`> hey can u tell , how to use a .css() from jQuery and to style element not with attribute style, but with CSS :)
[10:19:10] <sorush20> skylamer`: your not making sense
[10:19:21] <ryanneufeld> skylamer`: you mean to change the css on an element without adding a style attr to it?
[10:19:52] <ryanneufeld> skylamer`: if that's what you're asking, the only way to do that is to load another CSS file
[10:23:54] <skylamer`> yea
[10:24:17] <skylamer`> i look there're more than one way to use the .css() so, all of them is adding style="" ?
[10:24:27] <ryanneufeld> yes
[10:24:30] <skylamer`> ok, thanks
[10:24:34] <ryanneufeld> skylamer`: why is that a problem?
[10:25:12] <Spadeski> mekwall: You got the php to your plugin juppy?
[10:34:48] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: sup
[10:34:58] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: ui -dev? ill haed over
[10:35:47] <filipiz> skylamer`: use addClass()
[10:37:19] <gskudlarick> hello
[10:39:30] <sorush20> hi
[10:40:33] <gskudlarick> Great.. this is working.. I learned about this IRC from the JQuery Conference in Boston last month… I guess I'll just monitor it for a while and see whats happening...
[10:41:04] <scar2> when i  am calling a dialog via $( "#dialog" ).dialog({ show: 'clip' }); --- how do i set the other options of "show" ?
[10:42:17] <sorush20> hi how do I get a file download it on click?
[10:42:41] <sorush20> www.sadafnazari.com/www.rsp2000.com/cosmophobia_pdf.php
[10:50:28] <ryanneufeld> scar2: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-option
[10:52:03] <filipiz> sorush20: window.location.href='url of the file';
[11:03:17] <varrg> can I call .parent() on an array of elements? (retrieved by $('.class'); ?
[11:03:30] <varrg> I ultimately want to add a click event to each parent element of .class
[11:07:01] <ryanneufeld> varrg: no, you need to use .each()
[11:07:29] <ryanneufeld> varrg: if you use .parent on the returned array, you'll only effect the first one
[11:07:38] <ryanneufeld> ?.each() @ varrg
[11:07:38] <bot-t> varrg, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:07:53] <varrg> would I do it like: $(elements).each(function(){ $(this).parent().click(function(){...});}); ?
[11:08:01] <ryanneufeld> yes
[11:08:10] <varrg> cool
[11:08:11] <varrg> thanks
[11:08:16] <ryanneufeld> I would define your function ouside of that thogh
[11:08:29] <ryanneufeld> so myfunc = function()
[11:08:47] <ryanneufeld> $(this).parent().click(myfunc)
[11:08:50] <ryanneufeld> cleaner code that way
[11:09:01] <varrg> ye indd
[11:09:08] <varrg> will see which makes most sense
[11:10:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: actually elements.parent() returns the parent of all the elements
[11:10:49] <gnarf> so it works
[11:12:47] <varrg> really, that's convenient
[11:13:08] <sorush20> filipiz: I don't follow.. I'm a noob
[11:16:09] <filipiz> sorush20: try this: 1) add <iframe name='download-iframe' id='download-iframe' src='' style='display:none'></iframe> 2) on a tag do... <a href='url_of_the_file_to_download' target='download-ifreme'>download</a>
[11:17:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld / varrg: http://jsfiddle.net/Gh4VB/
[11:18:32] <sorush20> filipiz: but i'm trying to integrate the script into the extension that I have used. They are not anchors they are different http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
[11:18:46] <varrg> gnarf, very nice :)
[11:18:52] <filipiz> hmm
[11:20:43] <gnarf> varrg / ryanneufeld: all of the traversal methods work with collections to return collections (with the exception of the few that are quite singular)
[11:21:21] <varrg> very powerful :)
[11:21:27] <filipiz> 1) add <iframe name='download-iframe' id='download-iframe' src='' style='display:none'></iframe>  ... 2) use this : $('#download-iframe').attr('src', file);
[11:21:33] <varrg> I wonder if this is programming or just telling it to do stuff, hehe
[11:22:57] <kevin> Hey i have a small problem can anyone help?
[11:23:29] <Guest99778> anyone here?
[11:24:52] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: wat.... i thought... cool
[11:25:30] <ryanneufeld> varrg: you're making the choice of what it's doing. it counts as programming
[11:27:07] <sorush20> filipiz: am I on the right lines?
[11:29:01] <filipiz> sorush20: take a look at the example code at the section "Creating a File Tree" of http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
[11:29:09] <varrg> ryanneufeld, but it's so comfortable!!
[11:29:11] <varrg> :>
[11:29:20] <filipiz> where you read "alert(file);"
[11:29:33] <filipiz> use $('irc://chat.freenode.net/#download-iframe').attr('src', file);
[11:29:49] <filipiz> but dont forget to add the iframe on the HTML file..
[11:39:23] <JOSF> I load an HTML fragment, place it in a div of the page I load from and then I want to use a function, I have defined in $(document).ready(). This function gets called from the fragement. Result: Unknown function. What do I need to do?
[11:40:20] <JOSF> In other words: How do I cann functions defined in document.ready() from outside of it?
[11:41:22] <gnarf> JOSF: you can't -- you should define the function in a scope that contains the ready, and your form loading code and call it from both places - or assign the function to a namespace which is carried through the application and call it from both places
[11:42:06] <JOSF> gnarf: ok, thanks.
[11:46:01] <sk8ball> hey guys, i have an ASP.NET HiddenField (ID="foobar"), from javascript/jquery can i access it's value with: $('#hiddenBoolNoPromos').val()  ?
[11:46:06] <sk8ball> or sorry
[11:46:10] <sk8ball> #foobar
[11:46:14] <sk8ball> =P
[11:48:19] <sk8ball> anyone?
[11:48:30] <bitbuzzer> Hello
[11:52:06] <Scottie> hello. I was wondering if any one could help me with a jquery problem i am having
[11:53:38] <thomedy> has anyone worked with webgl
[11:54:12] <gnarf> ?tias @sk8ball
[11:54:13] <bot-t> sk8ball, Try It And See
[11:54:16] <gnarf> ?ask @Scottie
[11:54:16] <bot-t> Scottie, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:54:56] <gnarf> sk8ball: it should work, assuming its got an ID, etc
[11:55:02] <thomedy> i am trying to mess with it and see what it does actually alot more than that but i have been doing alot of reading and also now im experiment ing with the funcitons
[11:55:09] <_eagspoo> Hi this is somewhat of a jquery question:  I have an ajax form that includes file upload among other things.   Can I use the html5 FileReader api to serialize the actual content of the file to upload?  Instead of having to do something hacky like posting to an iframe?
[11:55:42] <Scottie> well, i am trying to get a "Progress Indicator" to .show() and .hide() with a delay before it is hidden. here is what it looks like:  http://scottie1972.dyndns.org/_test/jQuery.phps
[11:55:46] <thomedy> but when i read mat4.perspective (45,.... and change field of view from 45 to 30 the degree of which i see is not diff just closer
[11:55:50] <sk8ball> gnarf, yeah i will try it ... but my dev pattern is to do large segments of coding then debug
[11:55:55] <sk8ball> rinse, repeat
[11:55:58] <gnarf> _eagspoo: the iframe is the preferred method for posting stuff like that
[11:56:15] <gnarf> sk8ball: well it would be a REALLY tiny test case to test yourself, so just test
[11:56:18] <sk8ball> i dont like to build after every new piece of code
[11:56:27] <sk8ball> =[]
[11:56:32] <sk8ball> true enough
[11:56:48] <sk8ball> but i think i'm going to take your word that it should work
[11:57:00] <sk8ball> nd keep on woring and we'll see in a bit when i build
[11:57:03] <sk8ball> =P
[11:57:16] <sk8ball> and*/working*
[11:58:38] <sk8ball> so.. thx!
[11:58:50] <Scottie> well, i am trying to get a "Progress Indicator" to .show() and .hide() with a delay before it is hidden. here is what it looks like:  http://scottie1972.dyndns.org/_test/jQuery.phps
[11:58:58] <sk8ball> i'm a little new to integrating jquery into my asp.net apps
[11:59:06] <gnarf> Scottie: is there a question there?
[11:59:07] <sk8ball> i really love it though
[11:59:19] <_eagspoo> gnarf: it ends up being so hacky.  I need to know the response of the post so I'm having to put extra junk in the makup of the response then checking that when the iframe loads.  Just not very flexible.  Also I want to display the file right away so I'm going to have to use FileReader anyway.  Is it not possible to serialize from FileReader to an ajax post or is it just a bad idea for some reason?
[12:00:01] <Scottie> How can I delay the .hide() function using the code that I have?
[12:00:13] <snover> _eagspoo: XHR Level 2 allows for file upload.
[12:00:37] <RedOrigin> I'm trying to convert an php array to a jquery array, would someone mind looking over my code and explaining to me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/RedOrigin/YvejR/
[12:00:44] <gnarf> _eagspoo: well it limits the number of browsers it will work in, but if you're okay with that restriction, you could set a value of a hidden / whatever, its just a little dangerous, especially with binary files...
[12:02:04] <gnarf> RedOrigin: not using json_encode ?
[12:02:16] <gnarf> RedOrigin: also, including PHP in your javascript is a generally bad idea
[12:03:00] <RedOrigin> I know but the content is generated dynamically, also I am using jason_encode.
[12:03:30] <gnarf> RedOrigin: are you print_r'n a json_encode()d value?
[12:03:35] <gnarf> cuz thats silly
[12:03:47] <gnarf> just echo the json string from json_encode
[12:04:27] <gnarf> RedOrigin: dynamic or not, putting PHP inside your JS is >still< a bad idea
[12:04:47] <gnarf> its better to have your JS read the value from the dynamicly generated html page its included on
[12:04:53] <RedOrigin> sorry if I'm doing stuff that seems obviously wrong I've been working on this for a few days now though, I can't seem to wrap my mind around the json_encode and stuff.
[12:05:28] <RedOrigin> blah, but I don't want to have to load the generated content. It's like 30 embedded videos
[12:05:46] <gnarf> RedOrigin: json_encode returns a string - print_r'n a string makes it no longer json
[12:06:10] <RedOrigin> ohhhhhh... Well that definitely clears part of my problem up.
[12:09:49] <RedOrigin> How should I pass the generated content to my .js without a php variable?
[12:10:55] <Dave_Stein> if you're using $.ajax you can just use the success callback and grab the html out
[12:11:02] <Dave_Stein> but if youre just gonna pass data, use JSON intead
[12:11:25] <RedOrigin> jQuery.getJSON()?
[12:12:06] <Dave_Stein> its better to use $.ajax than the shortcut funcs, but yeah
[12:12:11] <ravenzz> read the doc, i prefer $.ajax as i have more control over the req
[12:12:12] <Dave_Stein> if you're going to echo out json
[12:12:23] <Dave_Stein> yup
[12:12:26] <Dave_Stein> esp error handling ravenzz
[12:12:38] <Dave_Stein> if you pass a json header, $.ajax will give it back to you as an object like you want it
[12:13:32] <ravenzz> well said
[12:13:35] <RedOrigin> okay
[12:14:02] <RedOrigin> I'll go study and apply then, thanks for the help.
[12:14:15] <Dave_Stein> and off I go
[12:14:26] <lkeijser> hi, how can i count the number of div's within one div?
[12:14:29] <RedOrigin> One more question though. How do I give a url to my ajax?
[12:14:51] <RedOrigin> I don't know the absolute path, I've been using php to generate my paths for me.
[12:21:35] <ravenzz> RedOrigin http://jsfiddle.net/VutgP/
[12:23:43] <errordeveloper> hi
[12:23:53] <RedOrigin> ravenzz: thanks
[12:24:04] <ravenzz> yw
[12:24:44] <lkeijser> silly question perhaps, but if i append a div to another div (let's say #div_container), shouldn't $('#div_container').length  be 2 ?
[12:24:49] <errordeveloper> I am looking for some library that would allow me to build a pretty page from JSON data
[12:25:10] <ravenzz> lkeijser no
[12:25:28] <errordeveloper> well, I want to specify how to display certain attributes in the given JSON-formated data
[12:25:46] <lkeijser> ravenzz: and $('#div_container > div).size()  ?
[12:26:01] <ravenzz> $('#div_container') selects any element with that ID, and length return how many are they
[12:26:04] <errordeveloper> I just don't want to re-invent the wheel if someone has done it already ..
[12:26:08] <lkeijser> ah!
[12:26:11] <ravenzz> that basically should be 1 or 0
[12:26:18] <ravenzz> because ID must be unique
[12:26:23] <lkeijser> right
[12:26:56] <ryanneufeld> lkeijser: if you have the id duplicated you might not know which one you're getting
[12:27:02] <ryanneufeld> could get the first occurance, or the last
[12:27:59] <lkeijser> okay i get that
[12:28:14] <lkeijser> and also that i'm totally doing it wrong
[12:29:35] <lkeijser> should count the number of classes, not id's
[12:30:23] <ryanneufeld> lkeijser: if you only want to get specific classes, then yes
[12:30:55] <lkeijser> yep
[12:30:58] <ryanneufeld> if you just want the count of all divs within another one: $('#someDiv').find('div').length
[12:31:01] <ravenzz> errordeveloper jQuery templates I suppose
[12:34:59] <lkeijser> cool that works fine, thanks :)
[12:35:45] <lkeijser> a (final) small question: if i fadeOut() something and immediately remove() it, the fadeOut isn't visible. Should i add a delay or handle it another way?
[12:36:18] <shesek> lkeijser, you can give the fadeOut a callback to be called when the effect finishes
[12:36:43] <ravenzz> ?fadeout @ lkeijser
[12:36:43] <bot-t> lkeijser, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[12:37:05] <shesek> $('#foo').fadeOut -> $(this).remove()
[12:37:11] <OomElvis> hey, can anyone recommend an ajax file uploader? there are so many...
[12:37:15] <shesek> oh, sorry, used to coffeescript
[12:37:22] <shesek> $('#foo').fadeOut(function(){$(this).remove();})
[12:40:05] <lkeijser> perfect, thanks a lot
[12:43:08] <RedOrigin> ravenzz: Woot! you are totally awesome. Your little code helped me so much I just wanted to say thank you again!
[12:44:10] <ravenzz> you are welcome ;)
[12:46:50] <bonhoffer> if i have a div full of JSON, how do i read it? $('#data').html <-- ?
[12:48:50] <snover> bonhoffer: the dom isn’t a data store. you should probably be fixing your application architecture.
[12:49:25] <bonhoffer> snover: true enough . . . but i have the json in a text file, say VA.json -- i can't read that on the client side
[12:49:40] <snover> ?
[12:49:42] <bonhoffer> so i was going to put it into the page and read it with my jquery
[12:49:50] <shesek> bonhoffer, there are still better options than putting it in a div
[12:49:55] <snover> What do you mean you “can’t read that”?
[12:49:59] <shesek> you can put it into a javascript variable directly
[12:50:08] <shesek> and besides, can't you use an AJAX request to fetch it?
[12:50:40] <bonhoffer> sorry i wasn't clear, on my server are a series of text files . . . each in json format -- i have jquery code i want to use this data, that is all i'm trying to do
[12:51:00] <bonhoffer> i thought i would load the data into a hidden div, then read it
[12:51:10] <shesek> I understood that. Can't you fetch those files using AJAX?
[12:51:14] <bonhoffer> i'm up for any better ideas (my server is a ruby (rails site))
[12:51:34] <shesek> Or, on the server side, generate some code to put that directly into a javascript variable ?
[12:51:52] <bonhoffer> i imagine i could, so i would expose the files in some public directory and the client side code would access them?
[12:52:01] <shesek> You server-side could just output `<script type="text/javascript">var data = <file contents>;</script>`, than you can simply use that variable
[12:52:08] <bonhoffer> shesek: i think the server side code is the best idea
[12:52:26] <bonhoffer> now i need to make sure my query can access that data file
[12:52:38] <bonhoffer> i think my code loads in <head>
[12:52:56] <shesek> I would personally just put those files inside the document root to make them available for AJAX requests
[12:53:25] <bonhoffer> that might be the way to go, but i don't see the ajax code right away and i'd have to read up on it
[12:53:30] <bonhoffer> loading the variable might be easy
[12:53:50] <bonhoffer> so, given a file in json -- i can render that to the page, but how would i load it into a variable?
[12:54:17] <shesek> if they're already in JSON format, its just a matter of outputting a <script> tag with an assignment
[12:54:19] <bonhoffer> var = {'a':'b'}.from_json
[12:54:25] <snover> yeah, not learning stuff is usually the best way to do things
[12:54:28] <bonhoffer> or something like that
[12:54:45] <shesek> bonhoffer, JSON is already readable by JavaScript, no need for any `from_json`
[12:54:52] <bonhoffer> got it, thanks
[12:55:30] <shesek> and making an AJAX request is only a matter of $.get('/path/to/file', function(data){ /* simply use `data` here */ }, 'json')
[12:55:37] <shesek> s/only/simply
[12:55:41] <bonhoffer> i'd like to learn ajax pulls, but staying focused is hard for me and i'm trying to get this out so i can go play with my kids at some point today :)
[12:55:53] <bonhoffer> thanks -- that looks easy enough
[12:56:28] <bonhoffer> where /path/to/file could be http://www.mysite.com/text.json ?
[12:57:03] <snover> ?tias @ bonhoffer
[12:57:04] <bot-t> bonhoffer, Try It And See
[12:57:12] <bonhoffer> will do
[12:57:36] <shesek> bonhoffer, it could be any URL on the same protocol, host and port
[12:57:48] <bonhoffer> thanks
[12:59:23] <shesek> bonhoffer, of course, you can also use relative URIs
[13:00:42] <bonhoffer> shesek: it is working well -- now i just need to read up on how to access data in the json object
[13:01:59] <bonhoffer> i'll take any good links to docs if you have a  favorite
[13:04:27] <bonhoffer> shesek: i have my variable, called, district_data which has a centroid, lats and lons, but district_data.lats is 'undefined'
[13:04:48] <shesek> bonhoffer, what browser are you using?
[13:04:49] <bonhoffer> in the chrome toolkit i can see the data are there
[13:05:06] <bonhoffer> i'm in the console, playing with the object to figure it out
[13:05:25] <shesek> oh, okay, that was what I was going to suggest
[13:05:46] <shesek> do you see it as a string or as an object?
[13:06:46] <bonhoffer> object
[13:06:56] <bonhoffer> with lats as array under that
[13:07:05] <shesek> hmm
[13:07:14] <shesek> how are you trying to access district_data.lats? from the console?
[13:07:23] <bonhoffer> yes
[13:07:35] <shesek> than its probably out of scope by the time you're trying to access that
[13:07:51] <bonhoffer> hmm. . . but i can browse the object -- see all the data
[13:08:01] <bonhoffer> by clicking on it
[13:08:19] <shesek> from a console.log inside the callback, or you're simply writing district_data in the console ?
[13:08:26] <dlv> write district_data to console, and you will see all properties
[13:08:46] <bonhoffer> well, i put a breakpoint in the function i want to use the data in
[13:09:08] <shesek> oh, it should work than
[13:09:20] <shesek> does a console.log(district_data.lats) inside the AJAX callback works?
[13:09:30] <bonhoffer> but that function is defined in head, my data is loaded in the middle of the page, but i thought my $(document).ready makes sure the DOM loads
[13:09:44] <bonhoffer> so inside my code? i'll try that
[13:10:09] <bonhoffer> frustrating to have a variable in the console i can see, but not play with . . . ok  trying in the code
[13:10:16] <shesek> something like $.get('/path/to/file', function(data){ console.log(district_data.lats); }, 'json')+
[13:10:21] <shesek> ah, sorry
[13:10:27] <shesek> something like $.get('/path/to/file', function(district_data){ console.log(district_data.lats); }, 'json')+
[13:10:38] <shesek> damn, those damn qassam alarms again
[13:10:47] <bonhoffer> got it -- maybe i need to slice it
[13:10:49] <shesek> I have to head down to the shelter :-\
[13:10:53] <bonhoffer> quassam alarms?
[13:10:55] <bonhoffer> where are you?
[13:11:14] <shesek> Israel
[13:11:21] <shesek> have to go, sorry... bye
[13:11:38] <bonhoffer> thanks for your help
[13:11:45] <bonhoffer> Peace be with you
[13:11:49] <bonhoffer> be safe
[13:38:56] <Raynos> I'm doing some simple benchmarks. I always thought that the overhead of function calls in ES land is minimal compared to manipulating the DOM in C++ land. However I can't optimise jQuery http://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-dom-yet-again :(
[13:39:38] <Raynos> As you can see it manipulates the css of elements which should cause reflow and rendering. I expected the jQuery overhead to small compared to reflow.
[13:41:34] <snover> Raynos: I do not understand why you keep saying “C++ land”
[13:42:22] <Raynos> I assume all browers are written in C++
[13:43:27] <snover> if you want your code to be a fair comparison start by using querySelectorAll in your DOM test.
[13:43:50] <Raynos> snover: I attempted to make the optimised jQuery sample a "fair comparison"
[13:43:51] <snover> Also by not using any features that do not exist in ES3 and IE’s DOM implementation
[13:44:32] <snover> sorry, I mean, IE6’s DOM
[13:44:37] <snover> Obviously IE9 is a lot better
[13:45:09] <snover> firstElementChild, etc. do not exist and are not things that jQuery uses
[13:45:14] <snover> also
[13:45:21] <snover> you are not actually setting width in your DOM version
[13:45:27] <snover> you are trying to set a number
[13:45:32] <snover> it has to be a string ending with a CSS unit
[13:45:33] <Raynos> Hmm, QSA makes twice as slow.
[13:46:00] <snover> var width = 820 - h2.style.width; // NaN
[13:46:14] <snover> span.style.width = NaN; // invalid, probably no reflow
[13:47:55] <Raynos> Thank you.
[13:48:37] <Raynos> I'm still suprised the function overhead is a factor of 10 :(
[13:52:08] <dwarder> where can i read about <input type=text> states
[13:52:19] <dwarder> i.e. focus, change etc
[13:53:18] <snover> Raynos: function calls are always expensive, DOM calls are just even more expensive.
[13:54:24] <snover> If you are trying to change the style of a whole bunch of elements at once, you are better off injecting new CSS styles to the document and let native code do the work of re-rendering everything
[13:54:43] <snover> it will be a single, much faster, reflow instead of thousands of tiny ones
[13:54:52] <Raynos> How do I inject new CSS styles to the document?
[13:55:39] <Raynos> I've also made the comparison more fair : http://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-dom-yet-again I still expected the DOM calls to be slower then the function call overheads.
[13:56:15] <snover> Raynos: you are not performing the same operations
[13:56:34] <snover> The first one is selecting for a single element
[13:56:46] <snover> which means that the querySelector call short circuits after the first element is discovered
[13:56:56] <snover> jQuery is querySelectorAll, all the time
[13:57:38] <Raynos> Ok that got the difference down to a factor of 5.
[13:59:12] <snover> every time you call a jQuery function it is not just like performing a function call, it is creating new jQuery object on each step
[13:59:33] <dwarder> where can i read about <input type=text> states
[13:59:42] <dwarder> focus, change etc
[14:00:13] <Raynos> dwarder : the HTML spec has some information on change here : http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#common-event-behaviors
[14:00:22] <dwarder> Raynos: thank you
[14:00:42] <dwarder> wow
[14:00:49] <dwarder> that is a big text
[14:01:23] <snover> Raynos: also, calculating width in jQuery is much more involved than simply looking at elem.style.width
[14:01:24] <snover> and
[14:01:40] <snover> calling .next() requires filtering out non-element nodes
[14:01:53] <snover> nextElementSibling is cheating, that does not exist in IE<9
[14:02:03] <Raynos> snover : why doesn't jQuery feature detect for it?
[14:02:07] <dwarder> what is the oppocite to .focus
[14:02:19] <dwarder> opposite*
[14:02:28] <snover> Raynos: because it’s new? :)
[14:03:33] <Raynos> Ah ok :) should I try patching those element features in?
[14:04:55] <snover> maybe. jQuery will never ever be anywhere near as fast as native dom manipulation
[14:06:00] <RandalSchwartz> anyone here know about datatables.net?
[14:06:10] <RandalSchwartz> my client is now waving money in front of anyone who can answer my query
[14:06:33] <Raynos> I know, I just expected it to be closer to a factor of 2. I didn't expect the function call and feature detection overhead to be so large compared to the DOM call overhead
[14:06:33] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/7175/override-_fnfiltercreatesearch...-where-exactly-do-i-put-the-new-version#Item_1
[14:06:56] <RandalSchwartz> since I'm stuck.  I can't figure out where to redefine this thing
[14:07:27] <snover> Raynos: you will probably see less impact in older browsers. DOM functions are still slow, but not nearly as slow as they once were.
[14:10:42] <Raynos> That makes sense.
[14:33:56] <dmemdfd> HI, I'm building a simple jquery function called on a form. When the form is submitted the function must add some hidden fields for each div with a certain class found.  I'm having some troubles in understanding how to do this, because if I call inside my function $(this).submit to fire the event, then I can't use this inside $('.className').each() to get data from each element. Is there any way to accomplish it?
[15:31:00] <oojacoboo> anyone know of any jquery scripts that support image mofification?
[15:31:05] <oojacoboo> modification*
[15:31:17] <oojacoboo> like changing hue, saturation, etc
[15:32:33] <sarspazam> how important would you guys say it is to understand javascript before using jquery?
[15:32:35] <snover> oojacoboo: jquery is not an image manipulation library. you should search elsewhere.
[15:32:42] <sarspazam> perhaps not just using, but coding aswell
[15:32:45] <snover> sarspazam: very.
[15:32:49] <oojacoboo> snover: what kind of BS response is that
[15:33:16] <snover> oojacoboo: The kind that you need, apparently :)
[15:33:37] <oojacoboo> snover: I never implied it was an image manipulation lib
[15:33:45] <oojacoboo> that doesnt' mean there isn't a plugin available for that
[15:35:01] <snover> Look, I realise that $ is the new window object but it makes absolutely no sense that jQuery would be involved in an image manipulation library.
[15:36:05] <oojacoboo> snover: again, unrelated
[15:36:15] <oojacoboo> I asked about a plugin
[15:36:36] <coldhead> are you proselytizing dojo as usual snover
[15:36:40] <snover> I might be coldhead!
[15:36:56] <snover> I didn’t know you guys used “z”s in words down there
[15:39:13] <sorush20> hi again.. http://www.sadafnazari.com/www.rsp2000.com/cosmophobia_pdf.php in regards to this page.. I wanted to open the files up.. I'm not doing things correctly hence I@m here
[15:40:46] <coldhead> i was showing consideration to your spelling deformities snover
[15:47:46] <Aquaguy> hey there
[15:47:58] <abjorn> hi
[15:50:19] <Aquaguy> I'm doing a html5/jquery file uploader but I'm facing a little problem.
[15:50:22] <Aquaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/hJd43/
[15:50:58] <Aquaguy> When creating several instances of the plugin in the same page, when you drag files onto one of the uploaders, all react to the event at the same time
[15:51:06] <Aquaguy> how can I solve it?
[15:59:53] <sorush20> I'm adding alert
[16:22:07] <anvandare> the ui draggable and sortable apparently remove the id from the dragged/dropped element (as well as the .data attributes); even with using 'original' as a helper. Is there a reason for this? and is it circumventable?
[16:24:06] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: you basically have to add the original data back
[16:24:35] <anvandare> how? i tried using the methods of sortable, but the data is already gone by then it seems
[16:24:43] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[16:24:58] <ryanneufeld> the ui object passed in
[16:25:04] <ryanneufeld> should have ui.item and ui.helper
[16:25:16] <ryanneufeld> in the receive handler on the sortable
[16:26:57] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yeah, in the receive handler ui.item is the original, so you can copy the data from that
[16:28:27] <Pessimism> Anyone with a link to a general tutorial to formatting buttons using jQuery? Such as highlight "foo", press the bold button, and get "<b>foo</b>". And if nothing is highlighted, get a prompt to enter the text to be bolded. (Etc.)
[16:29:08] <anvandare> Hmm, that'd work I guess, thanks ryanneufeld.
[16:29:32] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yeah sorry man, not much else I can off you. I was in the same boat
[16:29:35] <ryanneufeld> that's what I came up with
[16:31:18] <anvandare> No problem. :) It works, that's what matters more than elegance.
[16:32:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[16:39:15] <coldhead> elegance is a greater virtue than functionality
[16:39:23] <coldhead> you're a commie if you think otherwise
[16:39:35] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you have no evidence to prove that
[16:40:02] <ryanneufeld> also, please stop eating my bacon
[16:40:12] <ryanneufeld> I know it was you
[16:40:22] <ryanneufeld> also that change on my night stand, wasn't for a cab
[16:40:32] <ryanneufeld> you can find your own ride home
[16:40:37] <ryanneufeld> not like you ever pay for my cab
[16:40:55] <coldhead> wow, simmering resentment bubbles over
[16:41:42] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: aww, I can't stay mad at you
[16:41:56] <ryanneufeld> :)
[16:42:02] <ryanneufeld> lets never fight again
[16:42:29] <Raynos> ...
[16:42:37] <Raynos> Am I the only one creeped out
[16:42:43] <coldhead> no i am too
[16:42:47] <Raynos> Ok.
[16:42:49] <coldhead> and turned on, right?
[16:43:06] <coldhead> it's like the remake of texas chainsaw massacre
[16:43:15] <coldhead> how can it be right when it feels so wrong etc
[16:43:27] <ryanneufeld> hahahaa
[16:43:38] <ryanneufeld> hows it going buddy?
[16:44:19] <coldhead> it is monday morning
[16:44:24] <coldhead> hell on earth
[16:44:34] <ryanneufeld> It's sunday afternoon here
[16:44:40] <ryanneufeld> where the hell are you from?
[16:44:45] <coldhead> you lucky bastard
[16:44:56] <coldhead> i had a sunday afternon once
[16:44:59] <coldhead> it seems so long ago
[16:45:15] <coldhead> i am in mauritius
[16:45:27] <ryanneufeld> where is that?
[16:45:55] <coldhead> i withdraw that
[16:46:05] <coldhead> it's still sunday night there
[16:46:10] <coldhead> my story has holes
[16:46:19] <ryanneufeld> ah
[16:46:49] <coldhead> god damn, all the best places are still on sunday
[16:46:52] <coldhead> easter island
[16:46:55] <coldhead> cook islands
[16:46:57] <ryanneufeld> ewww, my gummy bears are wet
[16:46:57] <coldhead> samoa
[16:47:19] <ryanneufeld> whew, it's just bag
[16:47:25] <ryanneufeld> crisis averted
[16:47:32] <coldhead> a rollercoaster ride of emotions
[16:47:46] <coldhead> ending in gummy bear possession envy
[16:47:54] <ryanneufeld> gummeh bers r srs bzns
[16:48:00] <coldhead> one of the deadliest of the 7 sins
[16:48:53] <ryanneufeld> I just found both a runt, and mutant
[16:49:10] <ryanneufeld> separately
[16:49:13] <bapi_> I have included the lightbox plugin it works but it doesen't affect the new a hrefs that are being added dynamicly, how can I fix this? The code for initializing lightbox is as follow:
[16:49:15] <coldhead> it's like you're in the deep south
[16:49:27] <bapi_> $('#preview-img a').lightBox();
[16:50:38] <coldhead> can you call the plugin again whenever you add new content?
[16:52:39] <bapi_> I guess I could try that workaround, hm
[16:53:02] <bapi_> I figured it there were some jquery live() statement
[16:54:00] <bapi_> it worked, ty :P
[16:54:12] <bapi_> common logic i guess
[16:55:34] <coldhead> bapi_: live lets you add event handlers to elements that don't exist yet
[16:55:40] <anvandare> Nope, I can't seem to find a way to keep both a reference to the original item and the copy placed in the sortable at the same time (to transfer the id and data). I've got beforestop or stop, but neither works.
[16:56:07] <coldhead> but there's no 'dolightboxstufftothis' event
[16:56:22] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: if you inspect the list after you've added to it
[16:56:39] <ryanneufeld> you'll notice that the last item added still has the ui-draggable class on it
[16:57:12] <dogarrhea2> is there an event for draggables for when the dragged item moves one unit of distance in a snap grid?
[16:57:24] <anvandare> ryanneufeld: Yes, but I already have that one through item... What I haven't got is the original one (in the draggable list).
[16:57:47] <ryanneufeld> ui.item is the original
[16:57:58] <anvandare> in beforestop? or in receive?
[16:58:03] <ryanneufeld> receive
[16:58:18] <Scott0> with jstree how can i only use checkboxes on child nodes?
[17:01:23] <Scott0> id rather not show tham than show them then hide them
[17:02:06] <anvandare> I see, using $(this).find('.ui-draggable') does the trick indeed. Thanks again, ryanneufeld! :)
[17:02:21] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yeah
[17:02:23] <ryanneufeld> np
[17:02:38] <ryanneufeld> I'm working on another solution that will take advantage of beforeStop
[17:02:45] <ryanneufeld> stay tuned
[17:02:52] * anvandare tunes
[17:03:53] <ryanneufeld> I wish I could hide the sidebar on jsfiddle
[17:04:02] <ryanneufeld> seems to only be an option on mobile...
[17:06:08] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[17:07:40] <anvandare> A-ha! replacewith() to the rescue.
[17:07:56] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that works
[17:08:00] <ryanneufeld> keep in mind though
[17:08:05] <ryanneufeld> that ID's should be unique
[17:08:21] <ryanneufeld> have a ok at the fiddle I made
[17:08:22] <Aquaguy> Hello again.
[17:08:44] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: in beforeStop, I save the last item to the data for $(this) which is the sortable
[17:08:47] <dogarrhea2> why is the containment for jquery ui draggables so broken?
[17:08:57] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: it's not
[17:09:09] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: you can specify the parent to keep it within
[17:09:20] <dogarrhea2> ryannefeld, i need it to be mroe specific than that
[17:09:21] <anvandare> Well, the id's are a nicety, they're not really necessary since I've got .data as well
[17:09:27] <dogarrhea2> it cannot go below a certain point even within the parent
[17:09:41] <dogarrhea2> so specifying a window is just useless
[17:09:46] <dogarrhea2> it lets the thing go wherever it wants
[17:09:47] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: the point of the id is to be unique
[17:09:50] <Aquaguy> I've created a plugin with several methods with the var methods = {} scheme that is explained in the Authoring part of the Plugins docs. I need to access the element that called the plugin from one of the methods, I thought that $(this) would work, but it doesn't.
[17:09:56] <Aquaguy> Anyone can help me please?
[17:10:14] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: but I think you know that ;)

[17:10:57] <Aquaguy> When the method is called by an event binded to the element $(this) returns the jquery object containing the original html element, but when the method is called withing the plugin, $(this) returns the 'methods' plugin
[17:11:28] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: btw, you mentioning the beforeStop gave me the idea
[17:12:10] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, http://jsfiddle.net/hJd43/1/ there you have it
[17:12:36] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: no hablo espanol
[17:13:23] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, no need of spanish, but let me translate those 2 sentences
[17:13:59] <dogarrhea2> ryanneufeld: so there is no way to specify a containment window within a parent?
[17:14:00] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, http://jsfiddle.net/hJd43/2/
[17:14:19] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: bueno
[17:14:52] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, the problem is with the isInQueue method. I want to retrieve the 'div' object but instead $(this) is returning the var methods object.
[17:15:11] <anvandare> darn, apparently the ui-draggable is retained even after placement
[17:15:31] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yeah, you have to destroy it if you only want one
[17:15:41] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: what call isInQueue?
[17:15:44] <anvandare> But won't that disable the draggability?
[17:15:53] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, in the other hand, dragEnter, dragLeave.... those methods that are called by an event, $(this) returns the div
[17:16:01] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: not in the sortable
[17:16:35] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: yeah, that's due to how the events are called, what calls isInQueue?
[17:16:36] <Aquaguy> isInQueue is called by the drop method
[17:17:13] <dogarrhea2> ugly.  to get containment window within a parent, i have to add another div, set it's width and height and put it inside the parent. then i have to add the draggable with containment window to that div.
[17:17:23] <Whirl3d> Hey all, i need help with a preloader. Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/Lxv6U/6/
[17:17:24] <Aquaguy> is there any way to show line numbers in jsfiddle?
[17:17:56] <Whirl3d> Aquaguy, not that I have ever found. It would be great, though.
[17:18:01] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: that would be fantastic
[17:18:17] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: try this: !methods.isInQueue.apply(this,file)
[17:18:38] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: is that right to apply the current this, to the method being called?
[17:18:53] <anvandare> Darn it, now the sortables are cloning, instead of the draggables. :\ Hardly an improvement
[17:19:08] <abjorn> urface is hardly an improvement
[17:19:19] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: can you jsfiddle your code? or show what you're working on
[17:19:19] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, yeah, that would make it work, but isn't there any other way to get the element without having to add a new parameter to the function?
[17:19:21] <PrgmrBill> got you good
[17:19:26] <abjorn> ya i did
[17:19:38] <anvandare> ryanneufeld: kinda hard, it's a ton of code :\ let me see what I can do.
[17:19:50] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/Lxv6U/6/
[17:20:06] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: even a gist/pastbin would be helpful
[17:20:17] <ryanneufeld> probably only neeed to see the draggable and sortable code
[17:20:30] <ryanneufeld> Aquaguy: that's how you make this the this you want
[17:20:44] <ryanneufeld> that's how jquery's events are done
[17:20:48] <ryanneufeld> that or .call()
[17:21:25] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc call @Aquaguy
[17:21:26] <bot-t> Aquaguy, call - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[17:21:33] <ryanneufeld> ?mdc apply @ Aquaguy
[17:21:34] <bot-t> Aquaguy, apply - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[17:21:57] <ryanneufeld> only difference being if you pass an array of params or just one
[17:22:06] <ryanneufeld> so in this case I meant to use call, not applu
[17:22:08] <ryanneufeld> *apply
[17:22:17] <anvandare> ryanneufeld:  http://pastebin.com/pUTqdycg
[17:23:19] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: stylistic note: functions should not start with capital letters, typically classes/objects do
[17:23:50] <anvandare> Different tradition :P
[17:24:15] <dogarrhea2> code styles are overrated :(
[17:24:22] <ryanneufeld> you're overrated
[17:24:24] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: ui.item.draggable('destroy')
[17:24:28] <Aquaguy> ryanneufeld, didn't know about that, just read the docs, thank you so much.
[17:24:42] <dogarrhea2> when u see the code in production there is no such thing as style heh
[17:24:48] <anvandare> ryanneufeld: in place of?
[17:24:51] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: use that in your receive and it will prevent the original from being draggable anymore
[17:24:59] <dogarrhea2> and u just want to get things working. everyone complains about everyone else's code no matter how "stylish" it is.
[17:25:13] <anvandare> Oh no, I must've misexplained
[17:25:21] <anvandare> or wait...
[17:25:43] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: that's a shitty excuse, and most shops have code style guidelines. we have code reviews, and bad style is a defect
[17:26:07] <anvandare> Ah yes, it works indeed.
[17:26:09] <dogarrhea2> yes. where you argue about a capital letter for 30 minutes
[17:26:13] <dogarrhea2> i've been in those kinds of shops
[17:27:05] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: we chose an existing convention, and adopted it. There are things about it that we all dislike, but the code all looks the same, and everyone know what to expect
[17:27:11] <anvandare> I'm sure there are sufficient programs available that format the code in the style of your choosing. :>
[17:27:33] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: there are, but sometimes a manager just has to say "this is how it's gonna be, suck it up"
[17:27:37] <ryanneufeld> which kinda happened with us
[17:27:40] <ryanneufeld> and honestly
[17:27:43] <dogarrhea2> i remember at Cedars Sinai, some .net code was being reviewed
[17:28:06] <dogarrhea2> and it took half an hour between 2 programmers doing a review of code..
[17:28:15] <dogarrhea2> due to a stupid convention. the code passed qa otherwise
[17:28:50] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: clearly there was no standard through out the company
[17:28:55] <dogarrhea2> i was secretly thinking to myself "why am i even here.. the code is giong to be obsolete in a few years and no one will care to look at it again"
[17:29:10] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: I work with 10 year old code every day
[17:29:29] <dogarrhea2> eh. Cedars Sinai typically threw away old code and bought new systems
[17:29:34] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: and the people that wrote it followed a convention, and all the code looks like one person wrote it
[17:29:40] <ryanneufeld> so it's easy to follow.
[17:29:44] <dogarrhea2> and replaced the old staff with newer staff at a cheaper price
[17:30:05] <dogarrhea2> if you are tied to code, you are finished in the IT world
[17:30:07] <ryanneufeld> like this_is_a_function, thisIsAVariable ThisISAClass
[17:30:20] <joshsmith> does anyone have any thoughts on how to take Twitter's Bootstrap scrollSpy and modify it to make a sticky footer, rather than a sticky header?
[17:30:34] <dogarrhea2> twitter seems to think it's ok to throw away old code.
[17:30:45] <dogarrhea2> every shop throws away old code along with the original authors..
[17:31:24] <anvandare> every set of texts needs the occasional burn-everything-and-begin-anew...
[17:31:30] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure what you're point is dogarrhea2, or are you just being negative for the sake of it?
[17:31:48] <dogarrhea2> code "standards" are not really important
[17:32:04] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: well, there are some place you'll never work then
[17:32:30] <dogarrhea2> hehe. i'm starting up my own. screw overlords. i am going to be CEO.
[17:33:03] <ryanneufeld> for some companies, it's important. By following a standard, we "bicker" over how best to solve a problem. Not over where to put your {
[17:33:23] <ryanneufeld> unless it's JS, then it usually makes sense to put it on the right :P
[17:34:12] <dogarrhea2> yea.. is captialization REALLY going to mess up other people who go through your code? (unless it's ruby on rails)
[17:34:29] <dogarrhea2> they will complain no matter waht
[17:34:42] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: well, I was thrown off by looking at anvandare's code
[17:34:50] <dogarrhea2> or if not, they'll grumble to themselves as they ctrl + f or sed or grep through your code
[17:34:52] <ryanneufeld> I saw Receive, and expect it to be an object,
[17:34:55] <ryanneufeld> it wasn't
[17:35:33] <anvandare> my code has been obfuscated! ;>
[17:36:07] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: dogarrhea2's arguments aside. It makes sense to follow whatever style is already there.
[17:36:14] <ryanneufeld> in this case since you're working with jquery
[17:36:36] <ryanneufeld> functions are typically camelCased
[17:36:55] <anvandare> and variables all-lowercased?
[17:37:15] <ryanneufeld> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[17:37:24] <ryanneufeld> those are the ones for JQuery
[17:37:51] <ryanneufeld> I only suggest following them because without even realizing it the conventions will have an effect on how you comprehend code.
[17:38:43] <oojacoboo> does chrome inspector having a full DOM properties view built in?
[17:38:43] <anvandare> but I have my own style :o
[17:39:04] <oojacoboo> I can't seem to find it if it does
[17:39:09] <Whirl3d> ?.once
[17:39:10] <bot-t> Whirl3d, $(...).once(); | jQuery Plugins - Filters out all elements that had the same filter applied on them before. It can be used to ensure that a function is only applied once to an element. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once
[17:39:41] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: that's fine, I wasn't intending on having a huge discussion about it. It's like talking politics.
[17:39:44] <oojacoboo> wait, nm, I see it below the css styles now
[17:41:05] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: good luck with your project
[17:41:36] <anvandare> Thanks. :) It's coming up to the last big hurdle: make sortables push other sortables in adjoining cells out of the way.
[17:42:30] <ale_> Hello, is there a way to prevent my popup being blocked on firefox? It's a popup of my own server, firefox is blocking it
[17:42:49] <anvandare> allow popups?
[17:42:59] <anvandare> usually you have the option to allow specific servers
[17:43:05] <RandalSchwartz> why do you have a popup?
[17:43:20] <ale_> Because it's the only way I can show a whole new page
[17:43:37] <snover> ale_: no. stop being user hostile.
[17:43:41] <ale_> I'm not showing just plain data, I am showing a whole app
[17:43:46] <ale_> is there any other way?
[17:43:59] <ryanneufeld> ale_: target=
[17:44:06] <ryanneufeld> target="_blank"
[17:44:10] <ryanneufeld> open a new tab
[17:44:16] <ryanneufeld> new window
[17:44:18] <ale_> that's what I want
[17:44:22] <snover> ryanneufeld: if window.open does not work, target won’t work either
[17:44:27] <ryanneufeld> oh, right
[17:44:32] <ryanneufeld> meaculpa
[17:44:58] <ale_> So any other solution?
[17:45:30] <ale_> I thought using a ui dialog, but I can't, because I can't show the whole page on there
[17:45:58] <ryanneufeld> snover: window.open might not work, but if they click on a link with target="_blank" it will
[17:46:36] <snover> ryanneufeld: if they click on something that calls a function that calls window.open it will, too
[17:46:52] <snover> but in any case, opening new windows is a user-hostile action and really should not ever be done
[17:47:27] <ale_> but there is no link, it works with events, maybe if I bind a link and therefore open it as window.open, but from a supposedly clicked link which was binded with jquery?
[17:47:33] <coldhead> strong words
[17:48:02] <RandalSchwartz> "stop being user hostile" </second>
[17:48:19] <RandalSchwartz> you do not control my browser.  I do.
[17:48:33] <ale_> I know, but which other way can I do that?
[17:48:48] <RandalSchwartz> let the link open the way I want.
[17:48:57] <Whirl3d> if you bind the load event to an image element and then inside the handler, change the src attribute of the image element, shouldn't the load event fire a second time?
[17:49:01] <RandalSchwartz> do not care if it's a tab or a window
[17:49:16] <snover> ale_: what, exactly, are you trying to do? if you are loading an application, then…load it. why would you need a new window for that?
[17:49:50] <RandalSchwartz> do whatever target="_blank" does
[17:49:51] <ale_> okey, let me try that..
[17:49:54] <RandalSchwartz> do not force
[17:50:08] <RandalSchwartz> for me, that's a new tab
[17:52:51] <oojacoboo> question, I have a form where I want to ajax upload an image after selecting it with an input type="file
[17:53:03] <oojacoboo> I am wondering if I need to create two forms or if one would do
[17:53:06] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: uploadify
[17:53:08] <oojacoboo> there would be other form eleemnts
[17:53:12] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: no
[17:53:26] <oojacoboo> I'm using jcrop
[17:53:37] <wookiehangover> or be a baller and do it with xhr2
[17:53:52] <oojacoboo> wookiehangover: not sure I know about that
[17:54:03] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: does that work in older browsers
[17:54:11] <wookiehangover> ryanneufeld: no
[17:54:21] <wookiehangover> but fuck old browsers, amirite?
[17:54:25] <ryanneufeld> so, alienate a bunch of people?
[17:54:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah, sounds great
[17:54:42] <oojacoboo> so, would I need two form elements for this, or can I just pass one input as part of a post?
[17:54:42] <wookiehangover> no, they can have a non-ajaxy exp
[17:55:06] <coldhead> people with old browsers generally have the deepest pockets
[17:55:32] <wookiehangover> lol coldhead
[17:55:34] <oojacoboo> I know I can filter it out on the php side to only do something with that one input, but I'd prefer not to pass all the other inputs in the form as well
[17:55:42] <coldhead> you can just fallback to a form for them to enter their credit card details
[17:55:44] <coldhead> and they mostly will
[17:55:58] <wookiehangover> http://caniuse.com/xhr2
[17:56:18] <coldhead> http://caniuse.com/ecommerce
[17:56:21] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: why no to uploadify? it works really well
[17:56:51] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: why would I use that just to upload an image with no processing?
[17:57:07] <coldhead> oojacoboo: to show a progress meter
[17:57:08] <oojacoboo> plus it requires flash, no
[17:57:14] <coldhead> people love progress meteres
[17:57:21] <coldhead> it doesn't REQUIRE flash
[17:57:23] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: what devices support uploading that doin't support flash?
[17:57:23] <cook1es> Hihi, is it possible to lock elements from being edited by jQuery? For example if I am editing every h1 element, but want to lock h1 with class "headline" ?
[17:57:45] <oojacoboo> it's not about support
[17:57:50] <oojacoboo> it's about requires some bullshit plugin
[17:58:00] <oojacoboo> and iOS if you must ask
[17:58:34] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: ios doesn't have a file upload
[17:58:40] <ryanneufeld> your argument is moot
[17:59:06] <oojacoboo> you can't choose an img from your library?
[17:59:12] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: nope
[17:59:30] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: there is no way outside of a custom app to upload files on iOS
[18:00:01] <snover> oh shit son.
[18:00:05] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: and even then, you need to do it with native code. PhoneGap I think has plugins for that
[18:00:11] <snover> cook1es: no.
[18:00:30] <cook1es> snover: ok thanks
[18:00:31] <oojacoboo> well, that's the least of my concerns
[18:00:36] <oojacoboo> I was just trying to keep things simple
[18:00:42] <coldhead> k simmer down, stew
[18:00:55] <benstar> is anyone here familiar with bxslider?
[18:01:14] <oojacoboo> we already use uploadify for other upload forms
[18:01:26] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: then why change?
[18:01:45] <oojacoboo> I wasn't talking about changing, I was just talking about leaving that part out
[18:01:45] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: are you creating an inconsistent UI?
[18:01:52] <oojacoboo> ...
[18:02:01] <coldhead> all UIs are inconsistent
[18:02:01] <oojacoboo> I'm using jcrop
[18:02:11] <oojacoboo> if I could get around using jcrop and uploadify, why use both
[18:02:40] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: avatar uploader?
[18:02:45] <oojacoboo> logo
[18:02:47] <ryanneufeld> ah
[18:02:53] <ryanneufeld> I've done something similar
[18:02:58] <ryanneufeld> was for avatars :P
[18:03:16] <coldhead> avatars are just people logos
[18:03:30] * ryanneufeld pats coldhead on the head
[18:03:58] <benstar> anyone here familiar with bxslider?
[18:04:00] <ryanneufeld> my point is, I used uploadify and an a jS cropping tool (similar to jcrop)
[18:04:18] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing I would have to resize the image serverside if I didn't use uploadify, right?
[18:04:29] <oojacoboo> or does uploadify require server side resizing as well?
[18:04:37] <ryanneufeld> the reason was that it would work for the largest group of peopel
[18:04:58] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: are you wanting to do the resize on the user side?
[18:04:59] <oojacoboo> as opposed to a standard non-flash upload?
[18:05:12] <ryanneufeld> with a non flash upload, how would they crop it?
[18:05:17] <ryanneufeld> they'd have to upload
[18:05:20] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: well, I figured I'd have to resize it once before they use jcrop
[18:05:23] <ryanneufeld> then wait for a page refresh
[18:05:26] <oojacoboo> these idiots will upload huge logos
[18:05:31] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:05:41] <ryanneufeld> uploadify makes it possible to do that
[18:05:48] <ryanneufeld> I did the same thing
[18:05:58] * aksnowman digs out his 1024x768 logo...
[18:06:00] <ryanneufeld> when it's uploaded I check the size, and drop it down
[18:06:03] <oojacoboo> does that require server-side processing coded up
[18:06:06] <oojacoboo> or does the flash handle that?
[18:06:13] <ryanneufeld> no, it's server side
[18:06:20] <oojacoboo> by yourself?
[18:06:21] <ryanneufeld> the flash only handles the upload
[18:06:22] <oojacoboo> aka, php
[18:06:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, php
[18:06:28] <oojacoboo> ok
[18:06:52] <ryanneufeld> uploadify only does the uplaoding to the server
[18:07:01] <oojacoboo> right
[18:07:11] <cook1es> I just noticed that            var position = $(this).position();            "refreshes" some elements on my page, is there anyway to prevent this- or is there a workaround?
[18:07:27] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: once it's there though, you can return some data to one of the handlers
[18:07:31] <ryanneufeld> and then load the image for the user
[18:07:48] <oojacoboo> yea, I'll have to figure out all that passing around
[18:07:56] <oojacoboo> shouldn't be too bad I guess
[18:08:26] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/avatar/index.php
[18:08:36] <ryanneufeld> That's the one I built
[18:08:45] <oojacoboo> ugh login
[18:08:45] <ryanneufeld> you can login with facebook
[18:08:51] <ryanneufeld> and just remove the perms later
[18:08:55] <ryanneufeld> we don't send spam or anything
[18:09:01] <ryanneufeld> I've talked the mgmt out of that
[18:09:19] <oojacoboo> you just think you can login with facebook ;)
[18:09:30] <ryanneufeld> ?
[18:09:35] <oojacoboo> btw, they updated their oauth
[18:09:39] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I know
[18:09:44] <ryanneufeld> we're on it
[18:09:46] <ryanneufeld> :)
[18:09:53] <ryanneufeld> is it not working for you?
[18:10:00] <oojacoboo> no, button doesn't respond
[18:10:02] <ryanneufeld> I thought we pushed that code live
[18:10:03] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[18:10:19] <ryanneufeld> I'll have to fix that tomorrow
[18:10:22] <oojacoboo> the one at the top of the site does
[18:10:27] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:10:42] <ryanneufeld> oh shit
[18:10:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah it doesn't work
[18:10:53] <ryanneufeld> well, I'll make a ticket for that right now
[18:11:11] <ryanneufeld> facebook connect wasn't my project
[18:11:19] <oojacoboo> btw, I'd move that facebook log in button
[18:11:23] <oojacoboo> that's a terrible location
[18:11:28] <ryanneufeld> at the top
[18:11:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:11:30] <oojacoboo> it should be under the register
[18:11:36] <oojacoboo> with a line like this inbetween
[18:11:43] <oojacoboo> ---------- or ------------
[18:12:00] <ryanneufeld> I'll mention it
[18:12:10] <ryanneufeld> but in the future we're prolly only gonna have oauth logins
[18:12:25] <ryanneufeld> so facebook/twitter only kinda thing
[18:12:29] <ryanneufeld> that's a ways out
[18:12:34] <oojacoboo> yea
[18:12:35] <ryanneufeld> why do you feel it should be lower?
[18:12:52] <oojacoboo> well, your login form is bad all together
[18:12:54] <oojacoboo> to be honest
[18:12:59] <oojacoboo> it's WAY too cluttered
[18:13:05] <oojacoboo> and nothing is aligned properly
[18:22:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/Lxv6U/19/
[18:25:43] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: you're still working on that eh?
[18:26:18] <Whirl3d> most likely till the day I die...which should be soon, hopefully
[18:26:19] <jmaister> hai
[18:27:36] <jmaister> i've created a carousel with $("#name").carousel(). It has a dictionary of attributes (settings). How can I access them?
[18:27:43] <coldhead> we're all hoping that, Whirl3d
[18:28:09] <Whirl3d> for me? nice. Now, at least I see where you were coming from when I first met you...lol
[18:28:42] <coldhead> both for yourself and for us all
[18:28:48] <coldhead> it's nothing personal
[18:29:00] <coldhead> i hope everybody dies soon
[18:29:18] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I hope you die before me
[18:29:28] <coldhead> me too
[18:29:29] <ryanneufeld> cause you're so negative
[18:29:44] <jmaister> I guess what I'm trying to achieve is to get the JavaScript object of my carousel
[18:29:50] <coldhead> no YOU'RE negative to say that deathwishes are negative
[18:30:36] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: that depends on the plugin
[18:31:52] <Whirl3d> what is wrong with the statement: $(".imageClass").load(function () {$(this).once(loadComplete)});
[18:32:34] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: I just thought of something: Would var carousel = $("#name").carousel(); initialise the carousel _and_ give me a reference to the object?
[18:33:05] <anvandare> Whirl3d: your inner function doesn't have a ;
[18:33:16] <anvandare> $(".imageClass").load(function () {$(this).once(loadComplete);});
[18:33:38] <coldhead> $('.imageClass').one('load', loadComplete) ?
[18:33:46] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: that depends again on the carousel plugin
[18:34:39] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: if it's written the way that the jquery team suggests it should return a jquery collection object
[18:35:00] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: it's this one https://github.com/blackdynamo/jQuery-Mobile-Carousel
[18:35:02] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you're so negative, you're almost positive!
[18:35:41] <Whirl3d> ?.one
[18:35:42] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[18:35:54] <Whirl3d> doesn't work.
[18:36:08] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: it returns the jquery collection
[18:36:43] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: so it sould work?
[18:36:53] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:37:01] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: so neg, coldhead's pos? underflow? hahaha
[18:37:16] <coldhead> wat
[18:37:25] <aksnowman> 16:22:04 < ryanneufeld> coldhead: you're so negative, you're almost positive!
[18:37:46] <coldhead> oh it's a computer thing
[18:37:49] <coldhead> i get it now
[18:37:51] <coldhead> hahahahaha
[18:38:02] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: is there any way to get a reference to the object?
[18:38:03] <aksnowman> on a computer, if you keep subtracting from a variable, it either eventually gives you an error, or it wraps from a very large neg to a very large positive
[18:38:06] <aksnowman> lol
[18:38:21] <Whirl3d> where do I check for bug reports? I think .one is broken
[18:38:22] <coldhead> computers are so crazy
[18:38:28] <aksnowman> coldhead: agreed
[18:38:36] <coldhead> test case on jsfiddle is step 1, Whirl3d
[18:38:39] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: read their code
[18:38:40] <Whirl3d> done
[18:38:44] <Whirl3d> next?
[18:38:44] <coldhead> linkage
[18:38:49] <coldhead> assessment
[18:38:50] <coldhead> feedback
[18:38:55] <jmaister> jawol
[18:38:56] <coldhead> criticism of your brace style
[18:39:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/Lxv6U/25/
[18:39:47] <Whirl3d> might try it in firefox, chrome locks up
[18:40:12] <coldhead> yuh that's a bad thing
[18:40:20] <coldhead> can you make it a reduced test case?
[18:40:29] <coldhead> with as little code as possible to reproduce the failure?
[18:40:47] * Whirl3d is reducing
[18:40:58] <coldhead> bless your heart
[18:42:14] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/Lxv6U/26/
[18:42:20] <Whirl3d> simple load function one image
[18:42:38] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: doesn't look like there is a way
[18:42:47] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: what is it that you're trying to do?
[18:42:54] <coldhead> Whirl3d: The handler is executed at most once per element.
[18:43:09] <coldhead> maybe one() is not what you wanted
[18:43:20] <Whirl3d> why is it showing an infinite loop
[18:43:36] <Whirl3d> i want to avoid the load handler being called more than once
[18:43:56] <Whirl3d> and in IE, you have to check the Complete attribute of the image in case it's cached so it wont' fire the load handler
[18:44:00] <coldhead> Whirl3d: you probably want to set jsfiddle to execute ondomready, not onload
[18:44:31] <amh345> is there a way to have a click on a png on an odd shape?  for example http://i.imgur.com/csww3.png   assume each on of those is a href.  is it possible to detect that properly?  im trying to avoid flash like the plague here.
[18:44:33] <Whirl3d> wow. That's ridiculous.
[18:44:55] <coldhead> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[18:45:13] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: I've changed it slightly to also play an mp3 when it changes page if a var is set to true. I need to be able to fetch and alter the var
[18:45:33] <aksnowman> amh345: html map somethign or other
[18:45:49] * aksnowman googles the proper name/usage
[18:46:00] <ryanneufeld> amh345: yeah old skool image mapping skilz
[18:46:08] <amh345> aksnowman: oh man. there are 80 of those images.
[18:46:17] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: then why not bind to an event handler instead
[18:46:24] <aksnowman> amh345: lol
[18:46:30] <amh345> maybe ill use flash. haha
[18:46:34] <aksnowman> amh345: what are you trying to do? XD
[18:46:53] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: https://github.com/blackdynamo/jQuery-Mobile-Carousel/blob/master/README
[18:47:23] <amh345> aksnowman: i have to recreate a schematic of sorts. each piece loads a modal on hover and a href on click.
[18:47:25] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: and use .data() to set the var you want on the parent containre
[18:47:50] <aksnowman> amh345: ahh
[18:47:59] <amh345> and each shape is totally different.
[18:48:05] <amh345> craaaaaappp
[18:48:10] <aksnowman> hahaha
[18:48:34] <aksnowman> amh345: each one is different, as in the 80 or w/e images are all entirely different patterns?
[18:48:56] <amh345> 80 entirely different patterns. rounded edges. too.
[18:49:00] <amh345> this isnt going to be possible.
[18:49:05] <aksnowman> 'cause w/ a little math, you could probably automate the links/coords in an image map... ahh, eww
[18:49:07] <anvandare> imagemap
[18:49:08] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: thanks
[18:49:23] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: yeah, RTFM dude :)
[18:49:51] <aksnowman> amh345: I'd say imagemap could still do it for you, just not sure how efficient it might be, or if there might be a better way, haha
[18:50:19] <amh345> when you say image map..  you mean this?   (i know w3schools hah) http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap
[18:50:31] <ryanneufeld> yup
[18:50:36] * amh345 kills self
[18:50:36] <aksnowman> yeah
[18:50:37] <ryanneufeld> that's what he means
[18:50:48] <jmaister> ryanneufeld: Indeed. It's just that it's 02:50 at night, and i'm slightly stressed. So I need people like you to tell me to rtfm
[18:51:08] <ryanneufeld> jmaister: yes reading the fine manual usually helps :)
[18:51:12] <amh345> it'd take a month to make that map.  i think im going to have to use flash.
[18:51:16] <aksnowman> amh345: lol, it'd be entirely do-able, easiest way would definitely be to come up w/ some kind of equations for each one to automate your coords and modal/href's
[18:51:19] <Spadeski> jamister wanna go over good times we had i know what mood ur in bro
[18:51:23] <Spadeski> lol
[18:51:42] <aksnowman> amh345: you could do it in a few hours, if you're decent w/ geometry :D haha
[18:52:14] <aksnowman> maybe a little trig for the rounded stuff
[18:52:40] <amh345> im terrible with geometry.  :)  i wonder if i could just do the center area of the piece.  square it off.
[18:53:24] <aksnowman> yeah, I wouldn't try to do too many 'corners' on rounded stuff if you do this, just make circles into octagons or such, if you do use imagemaps
[18:54:03] <aksnowman> wish I had the free time, this would be a fun little challenge, haha
[18:54:06] <amh345> each of the 80 images has 2 rounded sides.kinda like a rectangle warped.
[18:54:16] * aksnowman loves things like this
[18:54:28] <amh345> i wish you had time too :)
[18:54:31] <ryanneufeld> amh345: are you doing uml?
[18:55:12] <amh345> no. no uml.
[18:56:20] <amh345> it's basically looks like a concert hall seating plan. sections though. not the actual seats.  so image the nightmare on that.
[18:56:43] <amh345> some areas longer than others.
[18:56:56] <amh345> and it's on a perceptive.
[18:57:02] <amh345> perspective.
[18:57:28] <ryanneufeld> I don't usually suggest flash
[18:57:52] <ryanneufeld> but flash might be a good solution until you can simplifiy your requrements a bit
[18:58:41] <jmaister> silverlight :P
[18:59:03] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: was it you working with the draggable stuff?
[18:59:06] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[18:59:09] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[18:59:20] <ryanneufeld> oh, shit, it was both of you lol
[18:59:25] <amh345> im wondering.. because the pieces are so small-- if i could just use a square/rectangle in the center of each piece.   the edges around the curve would not be clickable.  but it might not be a huge deal.
[18:59:44] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: yeah, was me
[18:59:57] <cook1es> to select several elements am I right to use $('#one')('#two') ?
[19:00:14] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: the fiddle i pasted shows a better way to get the last item added
[19:01:31] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: ahh, the method I ended up using w/ finding the 'ui-draggable' worked pretty well, 'cause I immediately .insertBefore() it, then .remove()'d the 'ui-draggable', haha
[19:02:18] <ryanneufeld> ah
[19:02:31] <aksnowman> what exactly is it doing there? instead of doing a jquery selector search for ui-draggable, it's using a draggable() function w/i ui.item or something?
[19:03:32] <aksnowman> oh, and I don't really *need* to find the newly inserted element anymore either, found a more efficient way to handle that, too, haha
[19:03:55] <aksnowman> learning a lot of jquery forcing myself to jump in neck-deep, haha
[19:03:56] <ryanneufeld> oic
[19:04:12] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: basically I'm storing a reference to the last item added
[19:04:17] <amh345> there's an interesting image map webapp someone wrote. http://www.image-maps.com/
[19:04:20] <ryanneufeld> I should be using data though
[19:04:54] <aksnowman> ahh, the .lastItem part?
[19:05:06] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:05:13] <aksnowman> gotcha
[19:05:19] <Whirl3d> when you change the 'src' attribute of an image, what makes it load the new source?
[19:05:43] <Guest20901> hey I have a very tough question that I couldn't find on the web dealing with $.post and $.get
[19:05:52] <imsky> sounds tough
[19:06:18] <Guest20901> I want to run a certain php function in a page of functions when I use .post or similar
[19:06:23] <Guest20901> how would I do this
[19:06:38] <Guest20901> for ex. I don't want a page for each php function
[19:06:44] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: the act of changing the src
[19:07:11] <Guest20901> I heard its possible
[19:07:13] <dogarrhea2> is there an animate function when you change the image via css?
[19:07:38] <ryanneufeld> Guest20901: you can pass a parameter in post  or get with the name of the function want, and then in your php using an IF you can choose which one to run
[19:07:40] <rook2pawn> Guest20901: when you post specify what things youd like to enact on the server and look for the post values in your php
[19:08:23] <Guest20901> I guess I could do that, but is there another way?
[19:08:40] <ryanneufeld> what are you looking for?
[19:09:16] <ryanneufeld> if you want to have all your functions in a single php file, and then call different ones via ajax
[19:09:28] <ryanneufeld> you need to have a way to know which one to call
[19:09:32] <Guest20901> How would I do that
[19:09:34] <ryanneufeld> it's the only way
[19:09:45] <ryanneufeld> using the data field in the ajax settings
[19:09:53] <Guest20901> oh ok
[19:09:54] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: or instead of a series of if's, a switch would probably work better :P
[19:09:56] <Guest20901> thanks
[19:10:11] <aksnowman> that way you could have an error or such if they didn't select a valid function/usage/whatever
[19:10:19] <aksnowman> @ Guest20901's thing
[19:10:21] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: yeah, but a switch might confuse him more
[19:10:26] <Guest20901> switch?
[19:10:34] <Guest20901> it might
[19:10:34] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: also forget one break, and the whole thing falls appart
[19:10:38] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: ahh
[19:10:38] <amh345> aksnowman: what do you think of this tool?http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/imgmap
[19:10:59] <ryanneufeld> Guest20901: just do and if(){}elseif{}
[19:11:06] <ryanneufeld> and you'll be fine
[19:11:07] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: when I start creating my switch()'s, I always add a break; after every single case before I start any actual code int he sections, heh
[19:11:13] <aksnowman> keeps me pretty safe against them missing
[19:11:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I do too
[19:11:22] <aksnowman> but I can see that being easy to miss for a beginner
[19:11:22] <ryanneufeld> till that time I didn't
[19:11:26] <Guest20901> another question,  when a user uses inspect element, changes the code, could they hack the site that way?
[19:11:33] <ryanneufeld> and had debug settings live on production
[19:11:48] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: if else if wouldn't have let me do that. just sayin
[19:12:02] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: true, a matter of preference I guess
[19:12:07] <Guest20901> yeah
[19:12:21] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: switches are great for some tasks, and would work fine for this problem for sure
[19:12:36] <Guest20901> oh ok, my other Q
[19:13:00] <ryanneufeld> Guest20901: they might be able to, but that's like asking if someone can steal your car if you leave keys in it and the doors unlocked
[19:13:11] <dogarrhea2> hmmm. so i guess i don't have the correct vocabulary for the effect i'm talking about:  Pretend you have a stage. pretend there are images drawn on the curtains.  Then you lower (not raise) the curtains to reveal another image
[19:13:14] <aksnowman> Guest20901: in theory, your php code should *always* assume users are trying to pass data, *always* validate inputs in your back-end code
[19:13:17] <aksnowman> ;)
[19:13:23] <dogarrhea2> what would the above be called
[19:13:26] <ryanneufeld> Guest20901: what aksnowman said
[19:13:45] * RandalSchwartz shakes head at "PHP"
[19:13:56] <dogarrhea2> ok what i want is a "rollover" effect
[19:14:07] <dogarrhea2> when i replace the background image. is this possible with animate?
[19:14:14] <aksnowman> amh345: dunno @ that tool, w/o spending a decent bit of time w/ it, it could definitely do what you want though, haha
[19:14:26] * aksnowman hasn't touched imagemaps in probably about a decade XD
[19:14:34] <aksnowman> holy crap, I'm getting old!
[19:14:36] <aksnowman> XD
[19:14:57] <RandalSchwartz> "if only I could work in a language that restricted my every move to what a beginner might do..."
[19:15:11] <RandalSchwartz> "would that even be possible?"
[19:15:21] <amh345> it's been years since ive done a map.  i  wondering how to ensure that when i move those coord over to map app-- that they are in the right spot.  i mean are image map coords relative to the actual image.. or the page?
[19:15:35] <RandalSchwartz> the image
[19:15:37] <aksnowman> the image
[19:15:46] <amh345> oh well that could save a lot of time.
[19:15:47] <RandalSchwartz> so you get 0,0 from upper? left
[19:15:54] <aksnowman> so as long as your image isn't resized, then you should be good to go
[19:15:58] <aksnowman> yes
[19:16:00] <aksnowman> iirc
[19:16:00] <RandalSchwartz> and some browsers had mapping already
[19:16:14] <RandalSchwartz> so you ddin't have to map it... you get differnt URLs for different regions
[19:16:35] <amh345> this might not be so bad afterall. apparently cs5 illustrator has an image map option too.   oh happy day!!  anyways. this is the wrong chan for this talk. i need #1994 .  thanks for the help guys.
[19:16:45] <RandalSchwartz> but other browsers you had to do the mapping server side
[19:16:50] <RandalSchwartz> hence the animosity
[19:17:19] <dogarrhea2> ugh. why don't random blogs ever have demos with their code
[19:17:20] <aksnowman> amh345: glad we could help :P
[19:17:26] <amh345> :0
[19:17:27] <dogarrhea2> i guess they just want to release broken code so no one can test it
[19:17:32] <RandalSchwartz> random blogs suck
[19:17:37] <aksnowman> also, wonder why my lappy keeps beeping at me :/ not being hilighted/etc... :/
[19:18:15] <RandalSchwartz> why don't random blogs pay my water bill?!!!
[19:19:12] <aksnowman> ahh, bitlbee flipping out on me, all is right w/ the universe again :)
[19:19:19] <dogarrhea2> so there is no way to do rollover except "roll" your own hrm?
[19:20:03] * RandalSchwartz ignores the nick " dogarrhea2 "
[19:20:16] * aksnowman doesn't know enough javascript/jquery for that one...
[19:20:55] * RandalSchwartz chuckles when people come to a public forum for answers, but have a totally crappy nick
[19:22:24] <dogarrhea2> heh he must be antisocial if a nick bugs him so much
[19:24:11] <coldhead> he gets by
[19:27:12] <dogarrhea2> bah why is google searching "hover" instead of "rollover"
[19:27:49] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: cause that's how you do a rollover :P
[19:28:42] <dogarrhea2> hover is just a mouse event when your mouse is on top of an element..
[19:28:55] <dogarrhea2> what i want is an image to be unrolled over another one.
[19:29:54] * RandalSchwartz chuckles
[19:33:20] <dogarrhea2> again it's probably my vocabulary.. imagine a painting rolled up and attached to the top of the ceiling. you release whatever is keeping it rolled up and let it unroll out. that's the effect i'm looking for..
[19:33:33] <dogarrhea2> eh i guess i'll do it myself
[19:33:36] <dogarrhea2> more hacks
[19:36:03] <coldhead> ?slidedown @ dogarrhea2
[19:36:03] <bot-t> dogarrhea2, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[19:36:41] <aksnowman> ha HA! you beat me to it, I knew there was something for it, hahaha
[19:37:14] <dogarrhea2> hrm .i noticed in the example it deforms the image as it is sliding down
[19:37:20] <dogarrhea2> there must be some option to not deform it no?
[19:38:52] <aksnowman> dogarrhea2: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ <-- like that, minus the extra ones of course?
[19:39:45] <coldhead> dogarrhea2: you can often fix that by wrapping the image in something and make that something the target of your animation
[19:39:49] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/
[19:40:42] <dogarrhea2> ryanneufeld: i would like the image that is getting replaced to not really do anything
[19:41:04] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/1/
[19:41:37] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: rather this one http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/2/
[19:41:45] <ryanneufeld> gott the order backwards
[19:42:14] <ryanneufeld> or are you wanting img2 to be the one moving?
[19:42:32] <ryanneufeld> cause that can be done too
[19:42:40] <dogarrhea2> hmmmm. this appears to do what i want (would like it to come down from the top
[19:43:18] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/3/
[19:43:20] <ryanneufeld> like that
[19:43:28] <dogarrhea2> actually it does not.. pretend you have a windshield wiper
[19:43:39] <dogarrhea2> and you are scraping a layer off
[19:43:51] <aksnowman> ?
[19:43:55] <ryanneufeld> look at my last example
[19:44:10] <aksnowman> dogarrhea2: as in, it doesn't re-appear?
[19:44:14] <aksnowman> just disappears the once?
[19:44:25] <ryanneufeld> that's even easier
[19:44:37] <dogarrhea2> ok i found it. http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/wipe.html
[19:44:59] <ryanneufeld> OH
[19:45:10] <dogarrhea2> the effect is "wiping" lolol
[19:46:08] <aksnowman> dogarrhea2: so which kind of wipe are you after? coming in from top-left?
[19:46:17] <dogarrhea2> from the top
[19:46:22] <coldhead> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-starwipe-plugin/
[19:46:25] <aksnowman> just from the top?
[19:46:42] <aksnowman> that's the last one ryanneufeld did, minus half the code, haha
[19:47:08] <aksnowman> unless you're needing to do it multiple times, or w/e, might have to add a bit more, heh
[19:47:12] * aksnowman goes back to making dinner...
[19:47:44] <amh345> amazing. illustrator has a mapping option that will map the object perfectly- rounded edges and all.  9 day task is down to 10 mins. figured i'd let you guys know about the illustrator thing.
[19:48:04] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/zGmCH/4/ :)
[19:48:52] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: he wants the image positiion to stay the sane
[19:48:54] <ryanneufeld> *same
[19:48:56] <ryanneufeld> and then reveal it
[19:49:07] <aksnowman> amh345: nice! good to know :)
[19:49:27] <amh345> :)
[19:52:03] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: gnarf like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/5/
[19:53:04] <dogarrhea2> that is perfect
[19:53:50] <ryanneufeld> doing it this way, you don't even have to set one image as a background
[19:54:49] <dogarrhea2> (the purpose of all this is to animate a picture of a semi quaver over an eighth note)
[19:55:36] <dogarrhea2> which would essentially be  like (almost) animating the extra flag but only vertically
[19:55:53] <dogarrhea2> thanks ryanneufeld
[19:56:18] <ryanneufeld> np
[19:56:22] <ryanneufeld> glad I could help
[19:57:04] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/zGmCH/6/
[19:57:11] <ryanneufeld> I added stop() before animate
[19:57:46] <ryanneufeld> so if you spaz out with the mouse overs it doesn't sit there and twitch like it's having a seizure
[19:57:57] <ryanneufeld> on that note of win, I'm out for the night
[19:58:18] <ryanneufeld> Homer is on the idiot box, and i must pay allegiance to him
[19:58:18] <ziggles> Hey guys, i have some code that looks like this: http://pastie.org/2785853 .  I've noticed that my call to loadTextHighlights() takes place AFTER the page as loaded and the result is that you see the text for a split second, then the highlights are applied -- is there any way to prevent this?  I'd prefer if the page rendered with the highlights already in place.
[19:59:03] <RedOrigin> hey I'm having some trouble with jQuery.parseJSON() . Would someone mind looking at this and telling me what I'm doing wrong? I'm being told that fvsJA is coming back as a null. http://jsfiddle.net/RedOrigin/6BSyg/
[20:01:01] <aksnowman> ziggles: make the element(s) load w/ visibility: none;, then hilight and .show()? or do the hilighting via CSS?
[20:01:26] <aksnowman> my first thoughts, anyways
[20:02:18] <ziggles> aksnowman: that's a good idea.  I was thinking about hiding/showing the entire page... so maybe have the body element be visibility: none; by default... then as the final step in my document.ready i show it
[20:02:31] <ziggles> aksnowman: but i'm not sure if that's good/bad practice
[20:02:37] <ziggles> pretty new here. :)
[20:23:56] <RedOrigin> how do you get parseJSON to parse a php array without giving a property name or value? I'm passing a json encoded php array to parseJSON(), but the array is just a numeric array [1]=>object, [2]=>object. How do I parse that?
[20:42:58] <aksnowman> ziggles: yeah, I dunno either, 'cause it would break the page if a user had javascript disabled
[20:43:10] <aksnowman> the user would never see anything
[20:43:38] <ziggles> aksnowman: so after some research... I'm seeing some people using JS to do a document.write to hide their elements w/ css... then they show after everything is ready.
[20:43:43] <amh345> i have a question.  i have a video that plays then forwards to a page.  the video is an animation that leads to the forwarded page.   the problem is is that the video and forwarded page are suppose to butt together seamlessly but i have a second or so inbetween request/response.  is there any way around that space in the request?  i cant make a request while the video is still playing so im guessing im going to have to use some fancy ajax stuff?
[20:43:54] <amh345> like load the content into a div and have it hidden until the video is done?
[20:43:54] <ziggles> Makes sense bc if JS is disabled then it never gets hidden... have not had a chance to try it out though.
[20:43:59] <aksnowman> ziggles: ahh, makes sense, yeah
[20:44:31] <aksnowman> just gotta make sure the original document.write isn't waiting for document.ready
[20:45:02] <Tobsn> overlay the video as a fullscreen div
[20:45:27] <ziggles> amh345: we are talking about situations where you tweak the UI of the page after it's already loaded.  What happens if you dont hide the element (or containing element) you are modifying is that for a split second it looks normal, THEN your js modifications kick in
[20:45:58] <ziggles> just a bad experience for the user.... In my case i'm loading a bunch of annotations on some text... the annotations are pulled down via an ajax request and applied after the page is loaded/rendered
[20:46:45] <aksnowman> amh345: I'd say what you said, and what Tobsn said would both work well, depending on your particular situation/setup
[20:46:46] <Whirl3d> though it escapes me, jquery api docs has an explanation of how to avoid that.
[20:46:51] <Whirl3d> ? load
[20:46:58] <Whirl3d> ?.load
[20:47:08] <Whirl3d> omg, bot-t is dead?
[20:47:24] <aksnowman> 18:12:49 -!- bot-t [~bot-t@unaffiliated/temp01/bot/bot-t] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
[20:47:37] <aksnowman> 20 minutes ago, lol
[20:48:00] <amh345> ok guys, thanks.   overlaying the video might be the simplest solution.
[21:20:05] <jmaister> does draggable events from jquery ui prevent click events from being sent?
[21:33:50] <greedo> I've almost got this right
[21:33:54] <aksnowman> jmaister: not sure, i know there is an option to prevent selecting text/etc you can set to prevent ambiguity, but not entirely sure about clicks
[21:34:13] <greedo> http://jsfiddle.net/MhpeV
[21:34:53] <greedo> I'm trying to use the contains to find the next matching element
[21:35:26] <greedo> so each of those arrows has a unique number
[21:35:51] <greedo> I need the correct thing to be displayed when I select the corresponding arrow
[21:36:09] <aksnowman> greedo: in the html, shouldn't the href='' be in quotes?
[21:37:01] <greedo> maybe, though it does not appear to be the cause of my problem
[21:37:46] <greedo> so, I set an id and then I just need to find the corresponding id
[21:38:45] <greedo> I take the id of .sliderButton and then I try to find the corresponding id for .inner
[21:46:14] <ndss56> hi, how do i do "has attribute" in jQuery?
[21:47:49] <Forbidd3n> How would I check which radio button is checked when they select a different radio button?
[21:49:56] <ndss56> Forbidd3n: add a class for inputs that have been checked and check for that.
[21:50:40] <Forbidd3n> I have to know which one is checked to add the checked class to it, right?
[21:51:39] <ndss56> Forbidd3n: correct. the current checked one would be (this)
[21:52:19] <Forbidd3n> I have this right now, that returns undefined. -- $('.acct_type').change(function(){ console.log($(this).find(':checked').val()); });
[21:53:59] <Forbidd3n> If I console.log($(this).find(':checked')) it returns the right obj
[21:54:07] <Forbidd3n> Not sure why val() is stating undefined
[21:54:11] <alsu> how do I set the offset of an element independent of the scroll position of the page?
[21:54:46] <alsu> using position:absolute and $(e).offset({left:l, top:t}) seems to result in different positions depending on where the page is scrolled at the time
[21:55:47] <ndss56> Forbidd3n: because attribute checked is not set.
[21:56:01] <aksnowman> Forbidd3n: is it maybe not recognising any checked boxes/radios w/i $(this) ?
[21:56:12] <Forbidd3n> ndss56: nvm if I just do $(this).val()
[21:56:14] <Forbidd3n> it works
[21:57:18] <ndss56> Forbidd3n: i doubt it.
[22:31:34] <greedo> got it guys
[22:32:03] <coldhead> good work, second shooter
[22:49:22] <dogarrhea2> g'night
[22:49:34] <dogarrhea2> don't let the slutty vampires with hepatitis c++ bite.
[22:54:16] <ndss56> lol
[23:02:19] <Whirl3d> coldhead, have you written any jquery plugins? Do you know of any good tutorials for extending Jquery?
[23:18:46] <amh345> what is the term for when you have an animation/text displaying while you wait for something to load in jquery?
[23:18:58] <amh345> im trying to google it but googlefu is failing

[23:31:44] <FloLeBlanc> hi all
[23:32:31] <IWT> Hello
[23:33:04] <FloLeBlanc> could someone help me out with a datepicker question?
[23:33:26] * IWT wishes he could find a c++ or visual studio channel to join as well :(
[23:34:01] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: I normally search the msdn for that
[23:34:31] <IWT> I need some questions answered to help me decide how I want to build the project becuase of the nature of what I need to accomplish
[23:34:37] <eago> hi, when jquery returns many items, what is what it returns? if I try using it as an array I just get the html, what do I have to do to get a specific item and work on it?
[23:35:45] <IWT> I am still catching up on jquery since I have been using YUI otherwise I would help you out eago
[23:35:54] <FloLeBlanc> <input type="text" id="datamints_feuser_1320_date_of_birth" name="tx_datamintsfeuser_pi1[1320][date_of_birth]" value="" /> I'm trying to access this with  $("#datamints_feuser_1320_date_of_birth").datepicker(); - but the error console tells me "no value for property datepicker can be found (the element itself can be found if alerted in the function)
[23:36:01] <eago> thanks IWT
[23:36:23] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: you can try to query me but I only had one bigger project in vb.net yet
[23:36:33] <eago> I think what I get is a collection, and I can loop using each... but what if I want a specific item
[23:36:34] <eago> ?
[23:36:40] <IWT> FloLeBlanc you dont have a value specified there so unless the picker is running before that code you will get that error
[23:37:04] <FloLeBlanc> ooooooh thank you
[23:37:05] <IWT> You need to know the id or some reference point to call it by without looping
[23:37:18] <IWT> Otherwise you can loop thru till you find the one you want
[23:37:28] <IWT> Then kill the loop
[23:37:51] <IWT> Thats only a good way to go when you dont have a way to directly access the element, which usually means a bad design model
[23:38:05] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: sorry didn't get that - I have the id and call by it. (you said the value is missing though?)
[23:38:34] <IWT> Yes, in your html theres no value defined to grab, so your picker needs to run first to set a date into the value
[23:38:44] <IWT> Then you can collect it
[23:38:58] <FloLeBlanc> will try that thank you
[23:39:09] <IWT> If your pickers running first make sure your setting the date value into the value property of the DOM
[23:39:14] <IWT> *DOM element for it
[23:39:27] <FloLeBlanc> I'M a bit puzzled though, the demo at http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ doesn't have that either
[23:39:51] <IWT> oh wait i got ya i read the code wrong
[23:40:23] <IWT> Whats going on there looks to be your trying to call a property of the input that doesnt exist
[23:40:31] <IWT> aka the .datepicker() function
[23:41:04] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: yeah I thought about that too, i enclosed it in a function though like in the link ( $(function() { ... })
[23:41:04] <FloLeBlanc>  ...
[23:41:14] <FloLeBlanc> sorry too many ... :)
[23:41:28] <IWT> Yea im reading the page now
[23:42:35] <IWT> Looks like that line of code is to be used to override the localization
[23:42:50] <IWT> Are you trying to make the date picker populate the value field with the date currently?
[23:43:42] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: actually this is a registration form and all I want is a datepicker to make it easier to input it :)
[23:45:50] <IWT> Its a bit more complex than just using the input and that line of javascript
[23:46:22] <eago> solved
[23:46:38] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: it is? the demo seems rather simple
[23:47:05] <IWT> View the source and find the js file /js/demos.js
[23:47:11] <IWT> That has all the code you need to work with there
[23:48:46] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: the datepicker part is still the short part they posted, just the included files are more (and I have those)
[23:49:18] <IWT> DP_jQuery_1320043261987.datepicker._selectDay('#datepicker',9,2011, this);return false; looks to be the important part not sure what the DP_jQuery_blahblahblah is exactly
[23:49:32] <IWT> Thats the heart of the selection from the popup to actually set the date
[23:49:48] <IWT> So with the other js it should auto build that part long as you make the changes right
[23:49:59] <IWT> I wish I could be more help
[23:50:07] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: thank you for looking into it
[23:50:41] <IWT> np
[23:56:04] <IWT> Jesus why is it every time i need an irc channel I can find everyone but what I need lol
[23:56:30] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: query me with your question, perhaps you are lucky and I happen to know it
[23:57:36] <IWT> I am trying to determine what MFC project settings to utilize are you familiar with MFC projects in visual c++?
[23:58:06] <FloLeBlanc> IWT: I'm sorry - no luck
[23:58:19] <FloLeBlanc> I could have told you about msreporting vs crystal reports :)
[23:58:32] <IWT> Would be so much easier if the settings had one that I want lol
[23:58:49] <IWT> I need a hybrid of the available options it seems :-/
