[03:51:19] <Dro> Hello, I'm trying to extract text between two words, the text is a html code and I need to extract any thing between <body> and </body>
[03:51:53] <Dro> I tried with str.match("<body>(.*)</body>") but it does not work
[03:52:07] <Dro> btw it work when I apply it to some words.
[03:52:43] <Dro> any idea?
[04:25:21] <Cork> Dro: why don't just parse it to dom and grab the element content?
[04:25:36] <meenu> how?
[04:26:36] <Cork> $($.parseHTML(str)).html() if i remember correctly
[04:27:57] <meenu> $($.parseHTML(str)).html()
[04:29:58] <meenu> sorry i did not get you
[04:30:36] <Cork> give me a min
[04:31:02] <Cork> ah, right
[04:32:26] <Cork> meenu: https://jsfiddle.net/m5roxa4s/1/
[04:46:33] <EugenA> why this.$searchbox.position() gives me "undefined"? this.$searchbox is an object.
[04:47:19] <Cork> is searchbox in the page?
[04:47:34] <EugenA> yes
[04:47:42] <Cork> a detatched element would have undefined as position
[04:48:13] <Cork> don't remember if a child of display: none gets it too...
[04:49:19] <Dro> Cork: I tried with parseHTML but it eliminate the <head> and <body>
[04:49:19] <EugenA> https://pastebin.com/nBWzaJxu
[04:49:24] <Dro> any other idea?
[04:55:07] <Cork> Dro: what are you trying to do exactly?
[04:56:11] <Cork> EugenA: what is console.log(this.$searchbox.length) ?
[05:27:55] <EugenA> Cork: this.$searchbox.length is 0
[05:28:13] <Cork> EugenA: there you have why .position() is undefined
[05:28:27] <Cork> the find for searchbox doesn't find the target
[05:32:37] <DreamStiffler> hi hi Cork can i ask you anything about apache?
[05:33:14] <Cork> uh, not really on topic for this channel
[05:33:32] <Cork> prob better asked in #httpd or something like that
[05:33:56] <Cork> #web would be fine too i think
[05:37:07] <DreamStiffler> yeap #httpd is dead
[05:38:51] <thykka> try #webdev
[05:38:53] <thykka> ##webdev
[05:55:35] <EugenA> Cork: why this.$searchRegion.find('.searchbox') and not simply $(".searchbox") ?
[05:56:27] <Cork> EugenA: can't answer that without knowing the structure of the project; but it might be using something to do mvc so this code don't have access to $
[05:56:36] <Cork> for example angular
[06:05:52] <FilipNortic_> if it is jQuery they could atlast call it $jQuery or something like that...
[06:07:08] <dimi1979> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/q4uy6p44/215/ line 78 or 83..this code there checks for an empty input field and warns the user accordingly...how I could possibly target the specific input..I want to style it
[06:08:51] <dimi1979> so that the user can know which input needs filling
[06:10:59] <FilipNortic_> dimi1979: save the results of your find in a variable?
[06:11:17] <FilipNortic_> or filter*
[06:17:48] <dimi1979> if you mean something like that https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/q4uy6p44/218/ line 82...it won't work...see for yourself
[06:19:35] <dimi1979> the result can be either true or false...
[06:28:05] <FilipNortic_> dimi1979: https://jsfiddle.net/q4uy6p44/219/
[07:02:56] <dimi1979> FilipNordic....thanks
[08:09:49] <Rayken> Hello! Anyone able to tell me why after detaching, the jQuery object won't update with new indexes/eq? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/rpNwKQ the point is to keep it rolling from 1-5 repeatedly each 3 seconds. But it only runs once due to I dont know how to update where I thought $( $items ) would *grab* them again after appending.
[08:12:56] <Rayken> replacing $( $items ) with $faq.children(".faq-item") works, but.. why won't $( $items ) work?
[08:14:15] <Cork> Rayken: $() returns a set of matched elements in an array like object
[08:14:19] <Cork> it is not dynamically updating
[08:14:32] <Cork> so if you want to update it after a change you need to fetch a new set
[08:14:51] <Rayken> So what could I do within the setTimeout instead of repeating $faq.children(".faq-item") ?
[08:15:05] <Rayken> I tried updating the "scope" of $items = $faq.children(".faq-item") but no go
[08:15:32] <Cork> what is this code suppose to do?
[08:15:36] <Rayken> oh maybe I do it after the first run above calling itself?
[08:16:03] <Rayken> Cork: in the end, the "centermost" topic should be 'active' and it should simply erm, scroll through the set of items looping infinitely
[08:16:31] <Rayken> hopefully adding some sort of animation going from topic to topic but gotta get the basics to work here I think. I can show you a "ugly" working example, 2 sec
[08:16:33] <Cork> its codepen so i just see the source code
[08:16:41] <Cork> codepen doesn't work well for me
[08:17:20] <Rayken> Cork: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/rpNwKQ if you check it now I updated it "uglymode" that's basically the starting point I want
[08:17:49] <Rayken> Oh, you can't see the result? Would jsFiddle work better?
[08:18:01] <Cork> yes, it normally works at least
[08:18:12] <Rayken> That's odd, okay I'll convert it to a fiddle, 2 sec
[08:19:41] <Rayken> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/dscvhtst/ okay so that's a "working" example with 2 exceptions - it doesn't animate anything nicely nor does it .. erm, I don't like how I need to fetch children again and again
[08:20:04] <Dro> Hello guys, I'm curious why this cause don't work:
[08:20:07] <Dro> str = '<html><head></head><body><div id="content">qsqsqsqsqsq</div></body></html>';
[08:20:20] <Dro> parsed = $.parseHTML(str);
[08:20:30] <Dro> and then str.find('#content');
[08:20:35] <Dro> any idea?
[08:20:49] <Cork> Dro: cause that is a document, and dom can't handle fragments that are a full document
[08:21:13] <Cork> either you will have to error correct/throw away what is outside body or use an iframe
[08:21:36] <Cork> (and iframe would need an url not a string)
[08:22:12] <Dro> Cork: thanks for the information
[08:22:38] <Rayken> Cork: line 10, 14 and 15 in that fiddle is what "bothers" me. Can I somehow update once instead of repeatedly ask for children? Or is this a case of "if it works it works" sort of thing ? ;p
[08:22:43] <Cork> Rayken: don't forget to use an requestAnimationFrame in there so you don't waste cpu updating when the page isn't visible
[08:24:09] <Rayken> ah good point, I'll make sure rAF gets in there somehow in the end, right now I'm just trying to figure out how to "optimize" not having to ask for children 3 times as I'm guessing that it looks it up thrice where I should technically only need to do it once, per iteration ofc.
[08:24:39] <Cork> Rayken: just have a raf inside the timeout function and everything inside the raf callback
[08:24:42] <Cork> it is enough
[08:25:12] <Cork> Rayken: if all you want is to switch through the different values why not just move a class and don't have the detatch?
[08:25:29] <Rayken> So the multiple calls to $faq.children('.faq-item') doesn't matter?
[08:25:57] <Rayken> Cork: I want to be able to have any number of "faq items", but only 3 visible at the time in an infinite loop to the first one comes again but below.. ehrm, like a spinner sort of thing.
[08:26:10] <Rayken> So I figured if I detach first and append last it would give me that result.
[08:28:06] <Rayken> Oh wait I think I got it
[08:29:19] <Rayken> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/dscvhtst/1/ <-- that is what I was trying to do, kinda. That should be better, no? + rAF on top of that, guessing I wrap the setTimeout?
[08:31:03] <Rayken> Cork: like this? https://jsfiddle.net/dscvhtst/2/
[08:37:06] <Cork> Rayken: yup
[08:37:58] <Cork> Rayken: anyway i would prob just set an active class and show the different elements though that instead of ripping them out of the page and inserting them again
[08:38:03] <Rayken> Cork: any suggestions to swapping out detach? I believe my approach is .. okay to do what it does right now. But if i was to try and fadeOut() the first element and sort of add some animation things get iffy.
[08:38:04] <Cork> but ya, both should work
[08:39:42] <Cork> it becomes a bit more complicated if you want to support multiple messages at the same time though
[08:40:55] <Cork> actually...
[08:40:58] <Cork> heh
[08:43:13] <Cork> Rayken: this is how i would do it https://jsfiddle.net/046b39hL/
[08:43:17] <Rayken> Cork: its purpose is to highlight the most frequently asked questions in a "spinner" like manner where the "middle" one simply takes bigger space because it's more highlighted, but as things move along other topics/questions get their spotlight.
[08:45:27] <Rayken> Cork: lol you just reduced my entire thing to a oneliner more or less. But yeah, that is what I'm after. However I think both solutions suffer the same consequence when it comes to animating though? Like, if I were to fadeOut the first question, move up the middle question, "size up" the bottom one and introduce a new one with fadeIn() kinda.
[08:48:00] <Cork> Rayken: https://jsfiddle.net/046b39hL/1/
[08:48:10] <Cork> you don't need to animate the adding back as it is a constant list
[08:48:34] <Cork> hmm gah yes you do
[08:48:44] <Cork> forgot the selector want see that...
[08:48:46] <Cork> hmm
[08:49:06] <Cork> you could use overflow and fade in the bottom though that but...
[08:49:41] <Cork> ya i would prob do that... it will have a height problem if they are different height though...
[08:50:12] <Rayken> ah I see what you mean
[09:10:16] <jquery200> How can I correctly check if an input's value is empty? I tried doing if (input.checkbox.val() == '') but that doesn't seem to work
[09:13:46] <thykka> it's an <input type="checkbox"> ?
[09:16:12] <poboy> :checked?
[09:16:32] <jquery200> yeah, but i'm not looking for it's checked vvalue
[09:16:42] <jquery200> I'm looking for it's 'value=""' string
[09:17:33] <jquery200> <input class="filterable-content__criteria" type="checkbox" name="topics" value="" id="group3-"> if the value is empty, I want to remove it
[09:17:47] <Rayken> Cork: wops, appears I was pinged out. https://jsfiddle.net/046b39hL/2/ is pretty close to what I want, except for the bottom one. Any idea how that could fadeIn?
[09:19:46] <Roldy> if(
[09:20:13] <Roldy> fat fingers, if $(inputname).is(':checked')
[09:22:46] <jquery200> I'm not looking to see if it was checked or not though
[09:23:17] <Roldy> whatre you trying to do
[09:23:27] <Rayken> well, $('input:not(:checked)').remove(); is one way, another is $('input[type="checkbox"][value=""]').remove(); I guess.
[09:25:15] <jquery200> value isn't synonymous to the checkedinp value though.
[09:25:32] <jquery200> checked value*
[09:25:59] <Rayken> A checkbox is either 1 or 0, true or false, checked or not though?
[09:26:26] <Rayken> Which means, yes. The value is "synonymous" whatever that means to its value xD
[09:26:41] <thykka> jquery200, https://jsfiddle.net/zby9uazg/
[09:27:11] <jquery200> but if you look at an input like this:     <input type="checkbox" id="subscribeNews" name="subscribe" value="newsletter">
[09:27:31] <jquery200> I want to check whether it says "newsletter" not whether it's checked
[09:27:36] <thykka> jquery200, ok https://jsfiddle.net/zby9uazg/1/
[09:30:23] <Rayken> or if you specifically want to check for newsletter I guess thykka but https://jsfiddle.net/zby9uazg/2/
[09:31:58] <thykka> > if the value is empty, I want to remove it
[09:32:11] <thykka> ^ my fiddle does exactly this.
[09:32:38] <thykka> of course, if the requirements keep shifting, implementing them can be difficult :-P
[09:33:24] <Rayken> well, your example allows for any value whereas mine requires newsletter so I guess it's up to what he/she really means he/she really wants xD
[09:34:14] <chrisw> Greetings, I don't know if this is the correct place to post this, but have a question RE chosen, Datatable and jquery.
[09:35:15] <chrisw> Specifically how to add a chosen select box to a new datatable row using an element selected wtih jquery.
[09:41:22] <freezo> How can I clear cache at specific time even if I not visit page?
[10:32:04] <dimi1979> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gkgkp5qq/2/ line 81 I want to access the formname of that input there...
[10:32:56] <dimi1979> this conditional returns true where there is an empty input...I want to find the form name of that input
[10:34:52] <Cork> you mean .attr('name') ?
[10:38:04] <dimi1979> give me a minute...I am not sure this will work...
[10:39:57] <dimi1979> I cannot believe it was so easy...I had mistaken something...thanks

[13:35:17] <catbadger> I found weirdness today... I have two .append()'s they are not in async code, yet i watched a customer manage to get the second append below the first. I can't reproduce this as there's no timeouts, or async calls. how is this possible?
[13:35:25] <catbadger> omfg
[13:35:31] <catbadger> the first append is below the second.
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:35:45] <catbadger> it's super strange. anyone have any idea how that happened?
[13:36:17] <catbadger> it's almost like they hit a javascript hiccup.
[13:36:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd have ot see the code.
[13:36:37] <catbadger> *boop* I'm just going to append above the sibling content..
[13:36:45] <catbadger> lol it's literally
[13:37:18] <catbadger> $(one).append(two); $(one).append(three);
[13:37:33] <catbadger> then three gets a jqgrid instantiated
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> you sure you don't have something later on mucking with it
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:38:56] <catbadger> maybe. my system is huge and coded by many
[14:11:54] <poboy> I will stab Select2
[14:59:46] <arnevdl29> are there any good cdn for jquery and jquery ui?
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> google's is popular.
[15:13:04] <hellyeah> finally i have a new job
[15:18:14] <poboy> congrats!
[15:18:35] <poboy> I'm still surprised I haven't been fired from my job
[15:25:50] <hellyeah> why?
[16:08:24] <poboy> hellyeah, I'm pretty terrible  :)  I'm making progress though
[16:19:17] <poboy> ok, this one is confusing me.  idk if it's another Select2 issue or what.  the dropdown is set to disabled and shows as disabled in the view, but I have an onchange function in my JSfile for this field and the user can still use the dropdown
[16:24:18] <freezo> Hi, I got hours and minutes I want to expire my cookie, but how do I put it together

[17:54:17] <Hypnotizes> ColdKeyboard = coldhead?
[19:04:32] <mihkkal> Hey could anyone take a look at this and see where I could possibly go wrong: http://jsbin.com/senawuxosi/edit?html,output - if you change the date it will fetch rows 200 times and at some point the DOM element will be removed completely. I can't seem to recreate the scenario using the demo page for the jquery library: http://fooplugins.github.io/FooTable/docs/examples/advanced/loading-rows.html
[19:10:45] <robertmaxrees> mihkkal why are you doing a $.get() inside of a for loop?
[19:11:02] <mihkkal> Just for debugging purposes
[19:11:08] <amundir> lol
[19:11:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:11:30] <robertmaxrees> so what's the actual problem you're tyring to solve?
[19:11:38] <mihkkal> I was playing around with a system I've made using the footable library and if I spammed the refresh rows button the DOM element would vanish - it's really bugging me
[19:11:52] <robertmaxrees> race conditions.
[19:11:59] <robertmaxrees> they might finish out of order.
[19:12:28] <mihkkal> yes, but I am a little green to jQuery, so I was googling my ass off to try and figure out how to solve it. Can you point me in a direction?
[19:12:46] <amundir> i'd disable the click event on the button until the ajax is done
[19:12:50] <amundir> or throw up an overlay
[19:12:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:13:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery-specific problem.
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> it's an async problem.
[19:14:11] <mihkkal> Yea my problem was mainly how I would go about doing it in jQuery, I don't touch a lot of js :)
[19:14:36] <mihkkal> disabling the click event until the ajax is done seems reasonable
[19:28:32] <robertmaxrees> i might use an overlay to make it clear what's going on.
[19:34:37] <mihkkal> well although it was a tad harder, I was still able to run into problems with race conditions even after binding / unbinding like so: https://pastebin.com/jagXWdf1
[19:36:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:37:04] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to do that.
[19:37:24] <robertmaxrees> does ft.rows.load(rows); overwrite the date input?
[19:38:04] <robertmaxrees> 'cause your overlay should prevent that input from doing anything.
[19:39:16] <mihkkal> no ft.rows.load(rows); simply cleans the table and does a redraw
[19:39:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so your overlay should prevent interaction with that input.
[19:39:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of juggling bindings.
[19:41:06] <mihkkal> so using overlays is recommended over doing on / off bindings?
[19:43:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:43:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the user can still interact with the page but it won't update as they make changes.
[19:46:03] <darkhanb> I have 2 labels with for pointing to the same input element, when I click any of the label input element is focused, how can I get a reference to the label that initiated that focus event?
[19:46:22] <darkhanb> Here is the simple code for it: https://dpaste.de/79E2/raw
[19:48:24] <robertmaxrees> darkhanb not sure you can really do that without binding click handlers.
[19:53:45] <darkhanb> robertmaxrees Is this safe then? https://dpaste.de/hp2U/raw
[19:54:22] <darkhanb> robertmaxrees let's say taking into account the assumption that nothing triggers focus event on the input
[19:55:00] <darkhanb> robertmaxrees and .on("click", ...) is defined before .on("focus", ...)
[19:55:45] <darkhanb> robertmaxrees also in general do all bound events execute in the same order they were defined?
[19:59:30] <robertmaxrees> well.
[19:59:37] <robertmaxrees> why would you need to know which one was clicked?
[19:59:42] <robertmaxrees> kind of an unusual use case.
[20:01:34] <mihkkal> Finally I can sleep sound, no more race conditions messing up my table! This did the trick: https://pastebin.com/iqqYv88T - I had to add the on / off because I was still able to use the arrow keys when the overlay was showing to trigger the race condition :)
[20:01:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:02:09] <robertmaxrees> that can still be prone to race conditions.
[20:02:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:02:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd unfocus the input instead but (shrug)
[20:03:12] <mihkkal> hm yea, but I still think it's nice to let the user keep going through dates with their arrow keys without being disrupted by an unfocused input field
[20:03:26] <robertmaxrees> even though it won't make a difference?
[20:03:30] <robertmaxrees> and it's actually lying to them?
[20:03:41] <robertmaxrees> since they can change the date but the display won't update?
[20:04:04] <mihkkal> heh, that is true actually
[20:04:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:04:15] <robertmaxrees> it's almost like i've dealt with this before :D
[20:04:39] <mihkkal> man you just can't win with web design, let me return to my back end sanctuary please haha
[20:06:29] <robertmaxrees> endusers.gif: http://i.imgur.com/xrX4VV0.gif
[20:06:39] <robertmaxrees> they will never use the thing you've made the way you intend them to.
[20:07:35] <mihkkal> yea fuck that, please let me return to back end, people who will use my scripts are hopefully able to actually read the code and understand how to use the system haha
[20:07:53] <robertmaxrees> just making a POC for them?
[20:08:40] <mihkkal> you were right and you win, this is a better solution.. https://pastebin.com/Kcs14HAR
[20:08:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:09:32] <mihkkal> I'll never agree to do the front end for my boss again haha :p
