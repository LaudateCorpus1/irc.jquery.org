[04:19:57] <scetian> Hi guys. Need some help here. I need to design a customize product plugin, something similar to this: https://www.ton.eu/en/products/detail/alba-armchair/. Can you any of you guys please point me in the right direction?
[04:50:42] <SomeGuy> Hi, I am having a problem with the jquery validate plugin
[04:51:33] <SomeGuy> I want to mark required fields depending if they are required or not, while the requirement is a condition
[04:51:51] <SomeGuy> I couldn't find any method to update it accordingly
[04:52:16] <ksm101> scetian: Maybe using jquery 3d viewers plugins or using your own solution by stocking object position (1/6, 2/6,...) and adjusting background position of a large photo containing all item perspectives ? I would wait for someone who already implemented something similar to answer...
[05:25:11] <ksm101> scetian: just a dirty example I did in a couple of minutes but you get the idea.. (it's not working really well, but ..) -> https://codepen.io/ksm101/pen/WEjRQe
[05:27:09] <ksm101> and then some clickable links/buttons to change the background-image according to user's choice
[05:28:22] <ksm101> maybe that looks a bit rough, but I'm sure you can set up something simple with a few line of code
[05:28:32] <ksm101> lines*
[12:43:22] <codecutter> wait 2 secs before running the function?
[12:45:35] <taplar> hmm?
[12:48:45] <codecutter> i think line 21 is executed too quick, perhaps i should make it wait a few secs before that line runs? https://pastebin.com/tYF8EpEk
[12:49:27] <codecutter> i am closing the window on the client side
[12:49:44] <codecutter> after doing some processing
[12:50:04] <codecutter> but sometimes the window is closed before the processing takes place
[12:50:40] <taplar> you're closing the child window?
[12:50:50] <codecutter> on the client side, yes
[12:51:08] <codecutter> block you see, is on on the serverside.
[12:51:18] <taplar> sounds like that is the part that is happening to quick then
[12:51:23] <taplar> not that processing thing
[12:51:32] <taplar> postMessage
[12:52:14] <codecutter> thats what i said, i need a timeer to wait a few secs before invoking that method or have i missunderstood?
[12:52:38] <taplar> you said you thought line 21 is executing too quick
[12:52:44] <taplar> which is the message send, not the close logic
[12:53:08] <codecutter> let me get you the client side stuff
[12:54:30] <codecutter> https://pastebin.com/ka1mV91V
[12:54:33] <codecutter> bottom
[12:54:48] <codecutter> where do i sleep?
[12:55:25] <taplar> that only happens if a message is received
[12:55:33] <taplar> so the message was sent by the child
[12:55:38] <taplar> what logic are you saying is not happening?
[12:56:33] <codecutter> something line 54 is invoked (closed window) without doing all the stuff that comes before that line
[12:56:41] <codecutter> sometimes*
[12:56:50] <taplar> in that case you have a logic flaw
[12:56:56] <taplar> because none of that logic is async
[12:58:08] <taplar> probably because you are setting the values to 'true'
[12:58:16] <taplar> and your conditionals are doing === 'somestring'
[12:58:52] <taplar> no, that's connSelected
[12:59:07] <taplar> whatever that is
[12:59:34] <taplar> if connSelected isn't any of those three strings, it'd do nothing but close the window
[12:59:44] <codecutter> connSelected is a local field that holds connection button that was clicked
[12:59:51] <codecutter> twiter, fb etc
[13:00:19] <taplar> so you need to do some debugging to find out in what case the logic is not happening
[13:00:25] <codecutter> its always one of those 3 strings
[13:01:20] <codecutter> i don't need sleep function?
[13:01:24] <taplar> no
[13:01:40] <taplar> so far nothing in this says you need a sleep
[13:01:42] <taplar> you got a logic issue
[13:02:00] <codecutter> here is my listener: window.addEventListener("message", this.uiHandlePostMessageReceived.bind(this), false);
[13:02:15] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:02:17] <taplar> debug man
[13:18:36] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[13:18:55] <taplar> :)
[15:16:59] <Mrgoose2> is there a cleaner way to do this?
[15:17:00] <Mrgoose2> $edit_button = '<button class="btn btn-gray" id="editrow">'+(row.friendly_name === null) ? "Activate":"Edit"+'</button>';
[15:17:06] <Mrgoose2> so i dont have to have html in javascript?
[15:17:23] <taplar> how much html do you have like that?
[15:18:15] <Mrgoose2> not a whole lot, i just thought it was frowned upon
[15:18:40] <taplar> if it's a small amount i could let it go.  if it's a lot you should consider a templating engine
[15:18:54] <taplar> but if it just a little, you could leave it like that or build it with js
[15:21:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/663ua9x6/
[15:21:41] <taplar> for a jquery take
[15:29:01] <Cyclohexane> is there a way to detect visible content between elements? https://jsfiddle.net/xw7wmnj2/
[15:29:57] <taplar> there's a :visible filter i think
[15:31:48] <Cyclohexane> there is but it returns text from the class="quote" despite it being style="display: none"
[15:32:15] <taplar> update the fiddle?
[16:12:06] <rizonz> is it possible that this doesn't work on a variable which is actually a selector ? varname.prop('disabled', true);
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[16:13:31] <rizonz> it's still posted
[16:14:12] <taplar> what is varname?
[16:15:05] <ngharo> inb4undefined
[16:15:20] <rizonz> $("input", form)
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> what is posted?
[16:15:26] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:15:29] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.,
[16:15:46] <taplar> console.log(varname.closest('body').length);
[16:15:56] <rizonz> it does not, should the diabled option be shown in the page source ?
[16:16:03] <taplar> no
[16:16:23] <taplar> run that console log before the line that does the disable part
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tc1kht8g/
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[16:17:23] <rizonz> mhh ok
[16:17:30] <rizonz> and then it's not send in the post ?
[16:17:39] <robertmaxrees> it should't.
[16:17:44] <robertmaxrees> *shouldn't.
[16:17:45] <rizonz> ok, thanks!
[16:18:05] <taplar> or not
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:18:19] <taplar> i was ignored
[16:18:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:18:36] <rizonz> taplar: you didn't pay the fee, bring beer
[16:18:40] <robertmaxrees> :E
[16:18:49] <taplar> your the dude asking for help, dude
[16:18:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:19:22] <rizonz> it should work on a dropdown ?
[16:20:23] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to find out
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ can update my fiddle to verify
[16:21:13] <rizonz> yeah just thinking about it
[16:21:18] <rizonz> I need some rest for 30 min or so
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tc1kht8g/1/
[16:23:51] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: but why input, select ?
[16:24:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:24:39] <robertmaxrees> because you want to select inputs and selects?
[16:24:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean "why the comma"? or...
[16:25:05] <rizonz> oh like that indeed, sorry
[16:25:37] <robertmaxrees> because 'input select' means "give me all <select> that are children of <input>
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[16:26:33] <poboy> I have a div "flatFee" that I don't want displayed when a button is clicked.  I've tried this, and also .(hide).  What am I missing?
[16:26:34] <poboy> $(document).on('click', '#newBillTime', function() { 	$("#flatFee").css('display', 'none'); });
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> poboy should work fine.
[16:27:24] <poboy> robertmaxrees the problem is the div is still showing!
[16:27:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8jgn183w/ poboy
[16:28:01] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[16:28:08] <robertmaxrees> you sure you aren't duplicating IDs or something?
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8jgn183w/1/ poboy you can do something like this to see if there's more than 1 or if there aren't any.
[16:31:27] <poboy> thanks.  it shows 0.  geez
[16:31:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:37] <poboy> the div is on my screen though
[16:31:47] <taplar> right click, inspect
[16:31:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:31:53] <taplar> look for the id on it
[16:32:48] <poboy> id="flatFee"
[16:33:15] <robertmaxrees> and the markup is valid?
[16:33:23] <robertmaxrees> update that fiddle with your html.
[16:36:31] <poboy> hmm.  the button is in a different file and opens this partial view. maybe that's it?
[16:36:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> is it on the same page?
[16:36:53] <robertmaxrees> like, in the browser?
[16:37:15] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/8jgn183w/2/
[16:37:26] <poboy> no it is on the previous page
[16:37:38] <poboy> when you click that button, it pops up this window
[16:37:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:37:50] <robertmaxrees> different window.
[16:38:12] <poboy> apologies for my ignorance.  This is my first week doing jquery.  :)   i was brought in as a php dev
[16:38:26] <taplar> good man
[16:38:37] <poboy> how should I handle this?
[16:40:09] <taplar> differnet window?
[16:40:43] <taplar> so you are clicking something on window1 and wanting to hide something on window2?
[16:40:49] <poboy> correct
[16:41:16] <taplar> same domain?
[16:41:34] <poboy> yes
[16:41:54] <taplar> protocol://prefix.domain.ext:port/  <-- that part is the same for both?
[16:42:11] <taplar> i got domain in the wrong place, but whatevs
[16:43:01] <taplar> yes?
[16:43:05] <poboy> um, I' not sure about that
[16:43:19] <poboy> it's just a modal that pops up on the screen
[16:43:28] <taplar> they have to be the same, or else your js won't be able to access the stuff directly
[16:43:35] <taplar> if they are then https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10468136/js-open-popup-window-and-acces-its-element-in-another-page
[16:44:09] <poboy> what if they're not?
[16:44:27] <taplar> probably would have to use a postMessage
[16:44:45] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[16:44:55] <poboy> ok, thanks for the help taplar
[19:44:27] <Gsham> anyone here?
[19:44:41] <Gsham> i am trying to send a huge html string from php to JSON with jquery and then append it to the dom
[19:44:52] <Gsham> but i guess the string has a lot of stuff in it. what can I do?
[19:48:57] <robertmaxrees> Gsham what's the issue with the html?
[19:49:06] <robertmaxrees> like... is there a bug or something popping up?
[19:49:35] <Gsham> its created in php by WordPress so its got quotes and lots of stuff and i save it to an array and send it and when i get it and try to use append i get nothing
[19:49:48] <Gsham> i know its being passed because console.log shows it
[19:49:55] <robertmaxrees> can you share what the markup looks like?
[19:49:59] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle or something?
[19:50:22] <robertmaxrees> also: are you sure you're appending it to an element that exists?
[19:51:33] <Gsham> heres a peice of it
[19:51:33] <Gsham> https://pastebin.com/dhpW9R9w
[19:51:41] <Gsham> yes i need it as a html string
[19:52:11] <Gsham> theres more but i think you can get the picture of whats being passed back
[19:52:17] <robertmaxrees> not...
[19:52:19] <robertmaxrees> not really?
[19:52:26] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't really tell me anything heh
[19:52:36] <Gsham> its just  ahuge bit of html
[19:52:56] <Gsham> WordPress outputs this on a page and i instead saved it to a a variable and passed it thru json
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> when you say "huge", how big?
[19:53:02] <robertmaxrees> like...
[19:53:04] <Gsham> its a form
[19:53:04] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:53:05] <robertmaxrees> so.
[19:53:24] <Gsham> how can i make it easier?
[19:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you're basically saying "this stuff doesn't work" and then telling me things that don't really explain what the issue is or anything.
[19:53:32] <Gsham> should i post whole string?
[19:53:46] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any console errors or anything?
[19:53:59] <Gsham> i have a html string. its got <script> html entities and everything else u could thing of
[19:54:03] <Gsham> no
[19:54:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.  are you trying to append the whole thing??>
[19:54:25] <Gsham> yes
[19:54:35] <Gsham> its one form with a lot of ...stuff
[19:54:37] <robertmaxrees> and it's a whole page, right?
[19:54:45] <Gsham> no. just a form
[19:54:46] <robertmaxrees> with a doctype, head, etc?
[19:54:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[19:54:50] <Gsham> no
[19:54:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it in action.
[19:55:07] <Gsham> ever use wordpress?
[19:55:23] <robertmaxrees> once or twice, but that's not really where your problem lies lol
[19:56:13] <Gsham> here is the full form being sent. this is what is EXACTLY coming back
[19:56:13] <Gsham> https://pastebin.com/Y5QrSLPT
[19:56:26] <robertmaxrees> and what about the code to handle the append?
[19:56:30] <robertmaxrees> jkust that specific part.
[19:56:30] <Gsham> if i try to use jquery on it nothing happens
[19:56:32] <robertmaxrees> not anything else.
[19:57:11] <robertmaxrees> wait, is it that the html isn't appending, or is it that the script tags aren't doing what they should?
[19:57:56] <robertmaxrees> because putting script tags in markup like that in general is a no-no
[19:58:30] <Gsham> it wont even append
[19:58:41] <Gsham> i tried to append to body and it wont work
[19:58:54] <Gsham> i cant change where the script tags are htye come with the form output
[19:58:55] <robertmaxrees> you said something about it coming back as an array or somethijng
[19:58:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:59:13] <Gsham> no i pass it as an array form => "big html string"
[19:59:32] <Gsham> and then i tried $(.body).append(response.form);
[19:59:33] <robertmaxrees> try this - go to your network tab and look for the request in there, then copy the raw response and paste that.
[19:59:52] <robertmaxrees> and also paste the specific code that's handling the append.
[20:00:32] <Gsham> https://pastebin.com/q4sLFuxQ
[20:01:59] <robertmaxrees> that's really not that bad for the payload size.  not ideal, but not huge.
[20:02:13] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mrhwqjLm/
[20:02:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering if maybe your append code is broken.
[20:03:01] <Gsham> :/ sigh... let me see...
[20:03:41] <Gsham> no i literral have the same as you
[20:03:42] <robertmaxrees> you're not, like, trying to append that outside of the success callback for the ajax call are you?
[20:03:53] <Gsham> i was testing with body...
[20:04:17] <robertmaxrees> erm
[20:04:30] <robertmaxrees> https://pastebin.com/dhpW9R9w this is what i have.  can you pull out the specific bits for the append
[20:04:32] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:06:23] <Gsham> ok i got it working somehwat.
[20:06:31] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[20:06:35] <Gsham> oh... i gtg. shoot. ill be on in like 20 if your still here :D
[20:06:37] <Gsham> but thanks
[20:06:45] <Gsham> im embarrased to say
[20:07:09] <Gsham> a letter was off in body
[20:07:12] <Gsham> :P
[20:07:19] <Gsham> i gtg.
[20:07:19] <Gsham> bye
[20:07:34] <Gsham> the truth is i need to use it with replaceWith to replace old form
[20:07:38] <Gsham> that is not working well
[20:07:45] <Gsham> body was just a test
[22:58:29] <javlens> When creating a click even to capture the current x/y of an image, how do you account for the fact that the image has been scaled down so you can get the actual original x/y? I tried using dividing the img.naturalWidth by the img.width to get a scale factor and then multiplying that by the e.pageX, but it isn't giving me an accurate location when I use those coordinate to populate a canvas using drawImage
