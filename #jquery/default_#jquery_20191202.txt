[05:15:19] <pj> Is this usage of .data() safe or is it subject to change in the future?: https://jsfiddle.net/kwdzg049/
[05:17:22] <Cork> pj: it is safe
[05:17:53] <pj> Cork: cool, thanks.
[05:18:04] <Cork> data is a public api in jquery for storing arbitary data alongside a dom element
[05:18:19] <Cork> it won't go away unless it gets depricated first in the api docs
[05:18:29] <Cork> (like any other jquery command)
[05:18:39] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[05:18:47] <pj> right, I just wasn't sure if the object returned by .data() might change in the future from a reference to the actual data object to a copy of it.
[05:19:06] <Cork> pj: note though that is NOT true for $._data() though, so if you ever plan to use that you do not have a guarantee
[05:19:14] <pj> if it ever becomes a copy then modifying the object directly like that wouldn't work.
[05:19:28] <pj> Cork: tbh I've never had any use for $.data()
[05:19:36] <Cork> pj: ya, that would be a api break
[05:19:51] <Cork> pj: and it is $._data not $.data()
[05:20:03] <pj> oh, ok, never used that either.
[05:20:12] <Cork> it is an internal function that some jquery functions use
[05:20:18] <Cork> it is what backs $().data()
[05:20:18] <pj> I would consider the leading _ an indication that it's internal.
[05:20:28] <Cork> ya, it is
[05:20:52] <Cork> might be worth knowing what backs $().data() is just a simple object inside jquery
[05:21:01] <Cork> with the expanded jquery adds to all elements as a key
[05:22:06] <pj> anyways, I just find that $("body").data().foo += 5 is a lot easier to look at and type than $("body").data("foo", $("body").data("foo")+5)
[05:22:26] <Cork> ya, and it is a supported format
[05:22:39] <pj> cool
[05:22:44] <Cork> jquery-ui uses it a lot for example
[05:22:58] <pj> ahhh, ok, well in that case it definately won't be going away.
[05:23:18] <Cork> not silently at least no :)
[05:23:40] <pj> I imagine that fi it did you would see a lot of breakage in a lot of places.
[05:23:43] <pj> *if
[05:23:45] <Cork> it can still go away, but it will be a quite bit notice and a deprication cooldown before it gets removed
[05:23:59] <Cork> ya, hense the comment about deprication
[05:24:17] <pj> yep
[05:24:22] <Cork> similar to how $().live() was removed and so on
[05:24:39] <Cork> it has happened, but it is always cause of a really good reason
[05:24:56] <pj> yeah, I can't imagine this going away, though if it already has widespread usage.  It would have to have a really good reason, as you say.
[05:27:22] <Cork> ya, anyway $().data() is backend by $._data() that is an object inside jquery that uses elm[$.expando] as key
[05:27:33] <Cork> so it is just a property access, nothing more fancy
[05:28:29] <Cork> (it was created back in the day when ie leaked like a sieve if you added attributes to dom elements)
[05:28:52] <Cork> now it is mainly a really good way to stor none string values related to a dom element
[05:47:08] <pj> right, I would consider it bad form to try to manipulate the element attributes to change the data anyways.  I tend to prefer that element attributes stay as static as possible so you can always look at them and know what the original element was set to.
[05:51:02] <Cork> pj: just to be clear, that doesn't manipulate the attribute value, it takes a value jquery put there
[05:51:35] <Cork> and ya, there is attributes you have to change to control newer widgets
[05:51:51] <Cork> so not changing attributes isn't really going to work
[05:53:09] <pj> Cork: yeah, I know, I said I prefer to not change attributes when possible, it's not always possible.
[05:53:18] * Cork nods
[13:04:37] <Kristjan1291983> Who can help me with Javascript ? https://jsfiddle.net/4L825z6f/    ..... There is a point (after about 10 sec load time), whitch has to move from one point to another, but when I try to draw the points on move, then it doesnt draw the points in some reason. Can somebody help ?
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> Kristjan1291983 2 things - 1: you're not actuallly using jquery in that fiddle, so wrong channel.  2: shotgunning the same question out to multiple channels is kinda uncool :)
[13:39:03] <digimer> hi all. New to jquery - I've got a JSON string that's a bit complex (validated against jsonlint though). I've got a nested array, and I can see everything if I loop through the outer array. I was wondering though, is there a way to reference a child-array based on a value in the parent array?
[13:39:21] <digimer> json: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/mc5HKyFbq23qZvybzjdzwA
[13:39:21] <robertmaxrees> digimer would need to see what you've got.
[13:39:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:39:34] <digimer> jquery: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/0KIg8Hvdg3EDf1SHloXjUw
[13:39:40] <digimer> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/LhiVGzHRzHw0kLuJkr900w
[13:39:43] <digimer> console output
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jquery for this.
[13:39:48] <digimer> heh, sorry, slow to type :)
[13:39:53] <digimer> no?
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:40:14] <robertmaxrees> you're just trying to get one object based on a particular value, right?
[13:40:30] <digimer> yup
[13:40:40] <digimer> ie: show all NICs on the host X
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
[13:41:08] <digimer> right now, I can make it work by skipping the hosts that don't match what I am looking for, but it feels a touch inellegent
[13:41:43] <digimer> (reading...)
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> so you want something like https://bpaste.net/show/YSP26
[13:45:29] <digimer> fairly new to javascript, too (been a console developer...), can I mix standard JS in jquery? I'm guessing so...
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[13:46:12] <robertmaxrees> it's just a library, not a separate language.
[13:46:18] <digimer> right, of course
[13:46:24] <digimer> sorry for the dumb questiong :)
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> nah, it's actually a surprisingly common misconception.
[14:31:09] <coldroom> anyone have insight into why the callback for post() uses a string for status?
[14:31:40] <robertmaxrees> what else would it use?
[14:32:11] <coldroom> the codes
[14:32:58] <robertmaxrees> that's in jqXHR.status if memory serves.
[14:33:24] <coldroom> hmmm...
[14:35:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:36:53] <coldroom> I was looking it up. You are right it's in there.
[14:37:14] <robertmaxrees> gotcha
[14:37:30] <coldroom> thanks
[14:41:20] <robertmaxrees> def. :)
