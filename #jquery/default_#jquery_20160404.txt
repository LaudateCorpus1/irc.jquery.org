[00:53:52] <Enerel> i am looking for responsive ad slider what do you recommend?
[01:17:00] <tash> Hi, I realize this fiddle is pretty crappy, but I wanted to start somewhere to ask my question: https://jsfiddle.net/w3zoLkf1/ ... Let's say for example that I click on the first <select> and choose "Complete", my goal is to get the number 91779 (if you inspect the elements you'll see 91779 in the id of the Date input, the Qty input, etc). Sorry if I am not asking the question perfectly =\
[01:50:40] <Sangeet> good morning people
[01:51:29] <Sangeet> why map is not loading in my page?i added it into pop up & embeded it
[02:01:27] <Sangeet> that map is only loading when i click on the pop up during the page loading is going on
[02:19:49] <tash> when I use .change() on a select box, how do I get the id of the nearest <td> ?
[02:29:18] <tash> n/m got it
[03:30:31] <shuva_free> i am using the keypress event to detect the key that is pressed and implementing it in a auto type functionality. Everything works as desired but the only issue is that on first press the first character is typed twice whereas i typed it once in my keyboard. Any help would be appreciated.

[05:00:35] <cuffed_rotator>         $('input#firstname').on('input',function(e){             $('.customer_name span').text($(this).text());
[05:00:40] <cuffed_rotator> The callback works
[05:00:44] <cuffed_rotator> But the span text doesn't change
[05:00:49] <cuffed_rotator> Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[05:02:34] <cuffed_rotator> Nevermind, got it
[05:04:02] <djam90> If I have an <li> with some text inside and a <span> element inside as well.. how can I get JUST the text, without wrapping the text in another span?
[05:04:29] <djam90> So the markup is <li>some text <span>remove</span> </li>    and the text I need to grab is just "some text"
[05:05:10] <djam90> I got it to work in dev tools by removing the <span> from the <li> and then doing .text() but I don't want to remove it
[05:07:50] <calbasi1> I suppose you could use a regex to select text between <li> and <span>
[05:08:19] <calbasi1> and put the output in a variable
[05:08:38] <calbasi1> but I'm a newbie and I don't know the way to do it...
[05:09:13] <calbasi1> The steps could be:
[05:09:26] <calbasi1> 1) Put all <li> text in a variable
[05:10:08] <calbasi1> 2) Select text between <li> and <span> using a regex
[07:15:22] <fuchstronaut> Can you tell me what t(...).data(...) is undefined means?
[07:16:06] <fuchstronaut> it just tells me that there is a typeError, but when I try to track it down using firefox' debugger each step is executed fine and then i get hit with that error
[08:48:23] <plexigras> hey guys i am trying to do a post request with $.ajax but firefox just throws a Cross-Origin Request Blocked
[08:48:59] <taplar> are you trying to access a third party site?
[08:49:27] <plexigras> yes a api
[08:49:29] <shoky> plexigras: you can't do a cross-origin ajax request unless the server supports it (e.g. with CORS headers, or hacks like JSONP)
[08:49:54] <shoky> server must specifically enable it
[08:49:58] <plexigras> you mean my or the apis server
[08:50:11] <taplar> api server
[08:50:12] <shoky> the server you're requesting from
[08:50:21] <shoky> read about same-origin policy
[08:51:55] <taplar> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:SameOriginPolicy.ppt
[08:52:16] <islalobo> Trying to use typeahead and bloodhound to create a autocomplete input field and having issue getting a json file to work as the source
[08:53:25] <decx> what's stopping you if you already use bloodhound
[08:53:40] <decx> set a prefetch
[08:53:41] <decx> done
[08:54:45] <plexigras> can you guys show me a good example for a ajax post request with headers and all.
[08:54:48] <plexigras> or just tell me what i am doing wrong http://ix.io/vx7
[08:56:20] <islalobo> decx so helpful...
[08:58:32] <decx> what else do you need
[08:58:35] <decx> it's easy
[08:58:58] <islalobo> It's not working, that's why I'm reaching out for assistanceâ€¦but thanks for being rude about it. Trying to use typeahead and bloodhound to create a autocomplete input field and having issue getting a json file to work as the source. Creating json results at {URL} but when I set t
[08:59:34] <decx> what's rude is you thinking that was a rude answer
[08:59:40] <shoky> plexigras it looks like you want   contentType: "application/json;charset=utf-8", data: JSON.stringify(body)
[09:00:06] <shoky> plexigras: but again if the server doesn't enable CORS then you can't do an ajax request to it
[09:01:54] <islalobo> decx okay....
[09:02:28] <islalobo> Well, decx I'm going to continue looking for help with my issue but thank you for your assistance
[09:02:38] <taplar> does => automatically return the result of the last statement?
[09:02:46] <decx> it does
[09:02:50] <shoky> plexigras: but it seems they do support CORS if you set the correct origin in your app settings  http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#introduction/cors
[09:02:55] <taplar> interesting (is learning about them)
[09:03:16] <decx> it's cool for one liners but i dont get the hype
[09:03:31] <shoky> => automatically returns the last statement? i don't think so
[09:03:41] <shoky> only if it's not a block but an expression
[09:03:56] <shoky> and then there's only one expression anyway
[09:03:58] <decx> that was it right
[09:04:16] <taplar> ah, so map( x => x.param ) is good but not map( x => { x.param } )
[09:04:27] <shoky> think so yea
[09:04:46] <islalobo> Trying to use typeahead and bloodhound to create a autocomplete input field and having issue getting a json file to work as the source. Creating json results at {URL} but when I set it as the remote value and add filter function I'm not getting any results
[09:05:37] <decx> stop repeating the same thing without actually elaborating your code and json structure
[09:05:41] <decx> that's so rude
[09:06:01] <plexigras> shoky, thanks. do you think it would work if i set the cors origin to http://localhost:3000/ ??
[09:06:05] <islalobo> That was an elaboration decx
[09:06:42] <taplar> islalobo: can you make an example of the issue?
[09:06:43] <shoky> plexigras: think so, if they allow it
[09:06:49] <plexigras> cool
[09:07:08] <islalobo> taplar: just working on getting one into fiddle
[09:07:15] <taplar> cool
[09:26:31] <decx> still waiting huh
[09:26:36] <decx> who's rude now
[09:26:41] <taplar> reading up on es6, :)
[09:32:49] <islalobo> decx get over yourself
[09:32:58] <decx> now that's rude
[09:33:01] <decx> what a rude person
[09:33:09] <islalobo> * sigh *
[09:33:13] <islalobo> Anyway
[09:33:18] <decx> and passive aggressive sighs
[09:33:24] <decx> what are you called, rick rude?
[09:33:45] <islalobo> No, just annoyed because I'm much more interested in figuring out this issue than having this interaction with you
[09:33:56] <decx> jokes on you i'm working with typeahead all day
[09:34:01] <islalobo> Great
[09:34:44] <decx> querying me?
[09:34:47] <decx> that's so rude
[09:35:59] <taplar> o_O interesting start to a monday
[09:39:21] <decx> kinda weird actually
[09:39:35] <decx> gave unspecific answer to an unspecific question and was called rude for it
[09:40:19] <islalobo> So, I'm working on getting typeahead and bloodhound to create an input field. The suggestion engine isn't suggesting values based on the term in the input field. I'm wondering if I'm just missing a step https://jsfiddle.net/hr5wen8p/
[09:41:08] <decx> it's transform not filter
[09:43:32] <islalobo> Updated https://jsfiddle.net/hr5wen8p/3/
[09:43:53] <islalobo> decx it should be transform?

[09:50:51] <Penorsaurus> Hi
[09:50:56] <Penorsaurus> I am having some issues
[09:50:58] <Penorsaurus> targetting an item
[09:50:59] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/EW9QMy6W
[09:51:10] <Penorsaurus> above is the html code
[09:51:19] <Penorsaurus> below is the way i am targetting it but its not finding the items.
[09:51:37] <taplar> woah
[09:51:50] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:51:51] <taplar> that's a lot of html in the js
[09:51:57] <Penorsaurus> taplar, I know, existing code :(
[09:52:15] <jomofcw> Is there a way to cancel an AJAX request having a defined URL ?
[09:52:38] <Penorsaurus> taplar, I just am not su re what I am doing wrong. It seems I am targetting it correctly.
[09:52:41] <taplar> jomofcw: iirc you can force resolve the deferred
[09:53:11] <taplar> Penorsaurus: which part is failing to select?
[09:53:34] <Penorsaurus> I am doing this: alert(mapmetadata)
[09:53:41] <Penorsaurus> which should return me the array of metadata
[09:53:50] <Penorsaurus> but when I do get the alert, it's empty.
[09:54:32] <jomofcw> taplar hello ! Resolve the deferred ?
[09:55:20] <taplar> Penorsaurus: can you provide more context?  your lookup is using 'this'.
[09:55:27] <taplar> jomofcw: one sec
[09:55:47] <Penorsaurus> taplar, my pastebin holds the relevent code I think.
[09:55:59] <Penorsaurus> unless you can think of a way I can specifically target the div the checkbox is in.
[09:56:28] <Penorsaurus> taplar, the checkbox is in a div called drstk-map-metadata
[09:58:06] <Penorsaurus> taplar, I think I actually got it.
[09:58:19] <Penorsaurus> $(".drstk-map-metadata input[type='checkbox']:checked").each(function(){ worked great
[09:59:25] <jomofcw> taplar_brb anyway I store the jqXHR in a data, and then test if that data is an object, if yes, I abort and reset it.
[09:59:30] <jomofcw> It seems to work3.
[10:06:33] <taplar> jomofcw: yeah, i was trying to find were we did that in our project, but yeah that sounds like what we did
[10:17:05] <taplar> hmm, i step away and both people resolve their issue, and I can't find my code.... gonna be a great day
[10:17:25] <taplar> probably on a branch some where...
[10:44:53] <Penorsaurus> Hi
[10:45:08] <Penorsaurus> I have an input: <input id="drstile-0" type="checkbox" class="drstk-include-map" value="neu:180455">
[10:45:16] <Penorsaurus> which is inside a div by the same name.
[10:45:26] <Penorsaurus> how could I specifically target the input in order to append something to it.
[10:45:50] <taplar> it's got an id on it
[10:45:57] <Penorsaurus> right.
[10:46:06] <Penorsaurus> but when I append it to the id, it doesn't append it to the input c heckbox.
[10:46:19] <taplar> how are you appending?
[10:46:31] <Penorsaurus> $("#drstile-0").append("<select> <option value='volvo'>Volvo</option> <option value='saab'>Saab</option> <option value='opel'>Opel</option> <option value='audi'>Audi</option> </select>");
[10:46:47] <taplar> text inputs doing have innerHTML to append to
[10:47:01] <Penorsaurus> how should I do it then?
[10:47:02] <taplar> i'd assume your after after()
[10:47:20] <Penorsaurus> so instead of append
[10:47:21] <Penorsaurus> use after?
[10:47:34] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[10:51:33] <jomofcw> taplar ;).
[10:51:47] <taplar> ?
[11:22:38] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, how would I append to an input id
[11:22:45] <Penorsaurus> where the id for the input and for the div are the same.
[11:23:08] <Penorsaurus> something like: input[id='?
[11:25:17] <taplar_meeting> id's can't be repeated
[11:25:22] <taplar_meeting> they must be unique
[11:28:42] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, I am using: $("label[for='drstile-"+ divid +"']").append(map_color_options);
[11:28:58] <Penorsaurus> its inserting it into the correct place (divid changes whenver a different div is clicked)
[11:29:06] <Penorsaurus> but the append is only working for the first one.
[11:29:46] <taplar_meeting> again, id's must be unique
[11:30:44] <Penorsaurus> id is unique.
[11:30:51] <Penorsaurus> its drstile-0 drstile-1 etc
[11:30:55] <Penorsaurus> I am working with existing code.
[11:31:21] <taplar_meeting> i thought you said the id for the input and div were the same
[11:31:31] <Penorsaurus> I was wrong.
[11:32:03] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, here is the relevent code snippet
[11:32:03] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/yrjg9XUH
[11:32:32] <Penorsaurus> the first alert: alert(divid) changes wh enever I click a different item.
[11:32:48] <Penorsaurus> the second alert in line 16
[11:32:53] <Penorsaurus> will onmly work for the fi rst element.
[11:33:04] <Penorsaurus> I am trying to use each, because simply appending it wasn't working.
[11:34:51] <taplar_meeting> your saying ln 16 doesn't match ln 5?
[11:35:08] <Penorsaurus> line 16 will only trigger once
[11:35:17] <taplar_meeting> right
[11:35:19] <Penorsaurus> yet line 5 triggers whenever an item is clicked (correct)
[11:35:33] <Penorsaurus> I need line16 is trigger everytime an item is clicked, much like line 5.
[11:35:44] <Penorsaurus> this is the issue I am facing.
[11:35:55] <taplar_meeting> do you see any errors in your console?
[11:36:10] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, not with my updated code.
[11:36:28] <Penorsaurus> I also tried: $("label[for='drstile-"+ divid +"']").append(map_color_options);
[11:36:36] <Penorsaurus> but again, it only triggers once.
[11:38:45] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, here is what works for the first item, but not for any other items.
[11:38:45] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/H5vizpKg
[11:38:51] <taplar_meeting> i'm missing something.  not sure why it's only firing once
[11:38:58] <Penorsaurus> yeah
[11:39:02] <Penorsaurus> it makes no sense.
[11:39:14] <Penorsaurus> I could try putting the function right after line 5
[11:39:17] <Penorsaurus> to see what is up.
[11:39:20] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[11:39:22] <taplar_meeting> wait
[11:39:29] <robertmaxrees> 5lbs?
[11:39:30] <taplar_meeting> your setting the value
[11:39:56] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, in line 4, I am, yes.
[11:40:02] <taplar_meeting> ln 10 and 12 are setting the value.  wouldn't that after the first time make the following if always be false?
[11:40:06] <taplar_meeting> *for the same element
[11:40:43] <taplar_meeting> yeah, i think the issue is with that
[11:40:53] <taplar_meeting> maybe 'type' isn't scoped down enough, or not granular enough
[11:40:54] <Penorsaurus> its existing code I'll have to adapt it.
[11:41:20] <Penorsaurus> I could try putting my function before line 9.
[11:41:22] <Penorsaurus> see what happens.
[11:41:31] <taplar_meeting> var selected = $(".selected-"+type).val();
[11:42:05] <taplar_meeting> if multiple elements have the same type, there is a chance that you will get the value set for another item
[11:42:23] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, multile elements have the same type
[11:42:34] <Penorsaurus> but they are uniquely identified by an id
[11:42:37] <Penorsaurus> which is divid.
[11:42:37] <taplar_meeting> so yeah, i think your issue is with how your doing that logic to get the value
[11:43:21] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, what line 10 is doing is
[11:43:29] <Penorsaurus> its setting selected-map (which is a div)
[11:43:35] <taplar_meeting> for all of them matching that
[11:43:37] <Penorsaurus> to have the pid for the selected items.
[11:43:50] <Penorsaurus> this is how it keeps track of what items are selected.
[11:44:03] <Penorsaurus> all i want to do is add a dropdown for selected items
[11:44:08] <Penorsaurus> where they can select those 5 options.
[11:44:11] <taplar_meeting> ln 10 is setting the value for every element matching that class
[11:44:40] <Penorsaurus> correct taplar_meeting it is adding the value of the pid to a div called "selected-maps"
[11:44:46] <taplar_meeting> so if you had two .selected-map it would set all of them
[11:44:54] <taplar_meeting> so it would only do stuff for the first map
[11:44:59] <Penorsaurus> there will never be two selected-map.
[11:45:04] <taplar_meeting> k
[11:45:25] <taplar_meeting> so yeah, what robert said, fiddle would be helpful at this point
[11:45:40] <Penorsaurus> long ass code
[11:46:00] <Penorsaurus> i'll try though
[11:47:38] <Penorsaurus> taplar_meeting, and robertmaxrees
[11:47:39] <Penorsaurus> https://jsfiddle.net/s523rmzc/
[11:48:04] <Penorsaurus> this is an example.
[11:48:10] <Penorsaurus> of the output.
[11:49:13] <taplar_meeting> so what steps do i need to do to see the issue
[11:49:41] <Penorsaurus> click on a single item, then click on another item.
[11:50:17] <Penorsaurus> but fiddle really isn't running it, which sucks.
[11:50:24] <robertmaxrees> it ran some alerts for me.
[11:50:33] <Penorsaurus> no alerts for me.
[11:50:36] <Penorsaurus> but anyways
[11:50:40] <robertmaxrees> need to add jquery.
[11:50:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s523rmzc/1/
[11:51:06] <Penorsaurus> ok perfect
[11:51:12] <Penorsaurus> so you see the first time you click an item
[11:51:19] <Penorsaurus> you will get several alerts.
[11:51:27] <Penorsaurus> the first alert is generated by line 12.
[11:51:37] <Penorsaurus> the second and third by like 53 and 54.
[11:51:53] <Penorsaurus> for the first item it works, as in it inserts the drop down for grouping
[11:52:04] <Penorsaurus> but if you click on another item it will not.
[11:52:53] <Penorsaurus> also, if you notice, <input type="hidden" class="selected-map"></div>
[11:53:05] <Penorsaurus> should be getting values based on the pid.
[11:53:09] <Penorsaurus> it is not doing so.
[11:53:16] <robertmaxrees> slow waaaaaayyyy down.
[11:53:28] <robertmaxrees> so i check 1, i see a dropdown.  what should i see when i check the second one?
[11:53:38] <Penorsaurus> the exact same thing.
[11:53:47] <robertmaxrees> a second dropdown?
[11:53:56] <Penorsaurus> you should see 3 alerts and a dropdown as well when you click a second item.
[11:54:13] <robertmaxrees> so a second dropdown should get appended?
[11:54:25] <Penorsaurus> a second dropdown should append to the second element.
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s523rmzc/2/
[11:57:57] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[11:58:08] <robertmaxrees> selected isn't an empty string.
[11:58:12] <decx> selected-map value is only empty the first time around
[11:58:19] <Penorsaurus> I see.
[11:58:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:58:30] <robertmaxrees> this is why console logs rock.
[11:58:38] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com - you should check this out.
[11:58:50] <robertmaxrees> start playing with your debugger :)
[11:59:00] <Penorsaurus> how do you show console logs in jfiddle/
[11:59:07] <robertmaxrees> the same as anywhere else.
[11:59:10] <robertmaxrees> you're browser's dev tools.
[11:59:13] <Penorsaurus> ok
[11:59:13] <decx> with the console
[11:59:13] <robertmaxrees> *your
[11:59:28] <Penorsaurus> that makes perfect sense actually.
[11:59:40] <Penorsaurus> so I should just check if selected exists then?
[11:59:43] <decx> no i actually am a browers dev tool, got me
[12:00:17] <Penorsaurus> I see the issue
[12:01:30] <Penorsaurus> robertmaxrees, I don't even need to worry about selected
[12:01:33] <Penorsaurus> now that i think about it.
[12:02:01] <Penorsaurus> yupe
[12:02:03] <Penorsaurus> works fine now
[12:02:09] <Penorsaurus> thanks robertmaxrees decx and taplar_meeting
[12:03:21] <decx> if it's legacy code there might be a not obvious reason to require an empty selected-type
[12:04:04] <Penorsaurus> decx, what if I wanted to  grab the value when a select item is set
[12:04:10] <Penorsaurus> I would assume this would be easy e nough to do.
[12:08:22] <decx> eh islalobo ever got it working?
[12:12:14] <islalobo> decx not really. suggestion engine is returning a json value and doesn't appear to be filtering through as expected
[12:12:39] <decx> had an open window from earlier in the background with your fiddle

[12:22:59] <sharkbone> Hi room was your weekend folks
[12:23:39] <robertmaxrees> it was a little rough, but okay otherwise.
[12:23:40] <robertmaxrees> yours?
[12:24:19] <sharkbone> Sports, family and little rest. Feeling very tired today
[12:24:28] <NoiseEee> tough times at the moment there eh robertmaxrees... best wishes
[12:24:47] <sharkbone> if($.browser.mozilla) {
[12:24:47] <sharkbone>    $('.logo').css('top','0px');
[12:24:48] <sharkbone> }             // This doesnt work in firefox
[12:24:50] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:24:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:25:18] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee it's continuation of stuff that started around this time last year.
[12:27:17] <sharkbone> I have general css working in webkit at 36px but had a issue in firefox so i decided set it to 0px using jQuery Dom manipulation. Still misbehaving
[12:27:33] <decx> well browser is no more
[12:27:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:27:46] <sharkbone> browser is no more?
[12:27:49] <sharkbone> ?????
[12:27:54] <decx> deprecated
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't use it anyway.
[12:28:03] <decx> use modernizr or any other feature detection
[12:28:09] <sharkbone> deprecated? what do i have to use then?
[12:28:20] <robertmaxrees> manually test yourself.  or fix your css so it's not an issue.
[12:28:38] <sharkbone> well fixing my CSS manually doesnt work
[12:28:47] <sharkbone> :)
[12:28:49] <sharkbone> wondering
[12:29:02] <sharkbone> i am creating experiments in optimizely
[12:29:24] <sharkbone> dont know if it is due to the optimizely editor but kinda messed up
[12:29:48] <sharkbone> i will check out modernizr
[12:31:19] <decx> maybe check out that css too tho
[12:31:21] <sharkbone> Well i am thinking calling from external jquery libraries into optimizely testing tool will be very cumbersome
[12:31:24] <sharkbone> :)
[12:31:28] <decx> 35px difference for firefox sounds unlikely
[12:31:49] <sharkbone> well i will paste the screen shot and share it here
[12:31:57] <sharkbone> so you know what i am talking about
[12:48:44] <islalobo> decx++
[12:49:43] <islalobo> Reading over more of the documentation to understand your solution
[12:50:27] <decx> the datumtokenizer just has to know it's an object and where it should search
[12:50:46] <decx> but if you have a prefetch you can just use transform to generate a simple array
[13:12:01] <Penorsaurus> decx,
[13:12:02] <Penorsaurus> http://pastebin.com/FVfyBT0j
[13:12:08] <Penorsaurus> can you tell me why my each isn't working?
[13:12:23] <Penorsaurus> I am checking to see if the custom attribute "red_group" is set.
[13:12:55] <Penorsaurus> if it isn't (which it should't be first run), then run line 15, which populates it.
[13:12:57] <Penorsaurus> otherwise, add to it.
[13:13:04] <Penorsaurus> it never finds an empty one.
[13:13:07] <taplar> if(colorgroup + "_var" == '') { would never be true
[13:13:15] <Penorsaurus> that was a typo
[13:13:19] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should use .data() and not create custom attributes.
[13:13:20] <Penorsaurus> if its just colorgroup == ''
[13:13:23] <Penorsaurus> it still returns nothing.
[13:13:30] <taplar> that also would never be true
[13:13:39] <Penorsaurus> why?
[13:13:48] <taplar> none of your strings in the array your looping over are empty
[13:14:13] <Penorsaurus> the array is just the name of the custom attribute fields.
[13:14:18] <taplar> are you assuming that it's going to associate colorgroup with the variable you created earlier?
[13:14:28] <taplar> cause it's not
[13:14:34] <Penorsaurus> red_group is the custom attribute field I am looking for.
[13:14:58] <Penorsaurus> is there a way to do that using each
[13:15:02] <Penorsaurus> or should I just have if statements.
[13:15:18] <taplar> you could put the variables in an object
[13:15:26] <taplar> and then do object[colorgroup]
[13:15:28] <taplar> to reference it
[13:16:54] <decx> wait
[13:17:01] <decx> you used _var like an extension?
[13:17:03] <decx> hehe
[13:17:09] <Penorsaurus> I guess.
[13:17:23] <decx> in js the scope thingy is not accessible
[13:17:26] <decx> chain?
[13:17:30] <decx> scope chain?
[13:17:33] <decx> something like that
[13:17:38] <Penorsaurus> let me try changing it to if st atements
[13:17:43] <Penorsaurus> I'll get that working first.
[13:17:45] <Penorsaurus> thanks guys
[13:19:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/49w71v4r/
[13:20:11] <taplar> typos in the groups creation, but you get the idea
[13:20:58] <sharkbone> http://snag.gy/mHznQ.jpg Please refer to link to get an idea of the issue i was talking about
[13:22:49] <decx> yep, bad css
[13:22:56] <sharkbone> bad CSS?
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> fix your css instead.
[13:23:34] <sharkbone> ok any tips? or clues on what i should be focusing on?
[13:23:38] <sharkbone> in the CSS?
[13:24:10] <decx> you should never need js for this kind ofstuff
[13:24:29] <decx> inline-block most likely culprit
[13:24:40] <decx> or some overflowig margins or lack thereof
[13:24:46] <decx> ##css
[13:26:32] <sharkbone> ok
[13:26:36] <sharkbone> great thanks
[13:26:49] <sharkbone> Jquery is an overkill i guess
[13:26:56] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> it's the wrong tool for the job.
[13:27:15] <sharkbone> okay
[13:27:29] <decx> yeah it's like "hey this window isnt airtight
[13:27:35] <decx> build a wall in front of it
[13:28:05] <sharkbone> ok
[13:28:09] <taplar> build a robot to seal it better, instead of sealing it yourself, :)
[13:28:26] <sharkbone> lol
[13:28:43] <taplar> and not just that, he only seals it when your around
[13:28:51] <taplar> he unseals it, and reseals it constantly
[13:29:03] <decx> that robots name, don quixot-o
[13:29:09] <taplar> heh
[13:29:42] <sharkbone> lol
[13:32:20] <taplar> hmm, or jake werry
[13:34:12] <taplar> this is my robot jake werry.  he takes care of my windows.  he also likes to find stuff, yah now, dum stuff
[13:34:21] <taplar> *know
[13:38:42] <decx> i think he's french
[13:38:44] <decx> jaque
[13:47:48] <taplar> i told my mom i had to explain my angular to her. so i finally admitted that i was jquery.  but she slapped me.  i didn't know how to react...
[13:48:23] <robertmaxrees> that story was a riot.  did you offer her your point of vue?'
[13:48:29] <taplar> lol
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe things are still in flux, then.
[13:49:53] <taplar> it's just hard to explain to her why i'm polling
[13:50:19] <taplar> she tried to call a timeout
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a pretty crazy event.
[13:51:58] <taplar> it threw me i tell ya, but i can handle it
[13:52:29] <taplar> but i appreciate you trying to console me
[13:58:53] <taplar> i guess what i'm really trying to say is that i want something else, ya know, to get me through this, semi-charmed kinda life
[14:04:33] <rogger_h> Hello all , im facing some issue regarding click event, i have a div which have a onclick="" event, in additional to jquery ui drag on it , when i click to drag to item it only trigger the click event, my question is , there is a way to avoid it , so if i drag it it wont trigger the click event ?
[14:05:43] <taplar> you should bind in your logic rather than with an onclick.  other than that, you might prevent the event from bubbling in the drag start if there is such an event
[14:06:23] <rogger_h> taplar , how can i prevent the event?
[14:06:43] <robertmaxrees> you should really use the dragstart/dragend events (or whatever they're called.
[14:07:01] <taplar> start and stop it appears
[14:07:22] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[14:07:48] <rogger_h> i have stop: inside my drag but its not preventing the click event
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not what we mean.
[14:08:01] <taplar> that would be well after the click happened
[14:08:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to not use onclick
[14:08:43] <rogger_h> robertmaxrees : but thats what im using
[14:08:49] <rogger_h> trying to find solution within what i have no
[14:08:52] <rogger_h> now
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> why not just fix the binding?
[14:15:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b9jp9zdy/ <-- it looks like if you bind the click to it afterwards, it's already cancelling it
[14:15:33] <taplar> though, if you don't want it to happen, you wouldn't bind it anyway...
[14:22:58] <bellesanna> I have a div element and i need to select just the input that is inside that div is there a way of doing so?
[14:23:15] <robertmaxrees> just like you would with css.
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> $('div input')
[14:23:38] <bellesanna> so if it had a specific class it would be $('.class input') ?>
[14:23:40] <bellesanna> ?*
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:23:47] <robertmaxrees> just like with css.
[14:23:48] <bellesanna> ok thank you :)
[14:32:52] <gambl0re> hello all
[14:35:36] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[15:08:07] <Ackis> I'm playing around with deferred and promises - http://pastebin.com/gnYrAEYY when I have my when in location 1 it fires immediatly, however when it's in location 2 it waits for all the ajax calls to happen - I understand why it's doing that and it makes sense, but from a code readability perspective is there anyway to have it in location 1 and "work"?
[15:08:45] <robertmaxrees> the ajax calls have to happen first.
[15:08:49] <robertmaxrees> you have to generate the oobject.
[15:08:51] <robertmaxrees> *objects
[15:09:02] <Ackis> that's what I figured
[15:09:11] <robertmaxrees> which, imo, is more readable.
[15:14:26] <Sal> to link together elements like drawer-button and drawer and obfuscator, whats the best way to do it? using the for="" attr , the data-... or classes?
[15:16:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:16:52] <robertmaxrees> how are they related?
[15:21:25] <taplar> kissing cousins
[15:21:40] <Sal> robertmaxrees, just to help me find them better
[15:21:45] <robertmaxrees> classes.
[15:21:48] <robertmaxrees> i guess.
[15:22:50] <Sal> ok
[15:23:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're building to really be helpful.
[15:23:52] <Sal> i told, ja a button that when clicked, should pass to jquery what drawer to open
[15:24:16] <robertmaxrees> then give it a data attribute that references a class.
[15:24:17] <Sal> and also, be able to find the obfuscator div to open it before the drawer opens
[15:24:27] <robertmaxrees> "obfuscator div"?
[15:24:33] <Sal> oh, not the drawer's id?
[15:24:38] <Sal> a class is better?
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:24:44] <robertmaxrees> or an ID.
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> i avoid IDs, but you could use one.
[15:24:59] <Sal> yes, the grayed div under the drawer
[15:25:14] <robertmaxrees> ah, you mean the overlay?
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> you should already have a generic overlay that you can reference.
[15:25:39] <robertmaxrees> no need to add a reference to it on an element.
[15:26:50] <Sal> ok, i got it, ok 1 overlay for all panels, and link the button using data
[15:26:53] <Sal> ok, thanks
[15:27:48] * Sal is going to dinner
[15:41:26] <plexigras> can i do promise.done().fail() ??
[15:41:42] <robertmaxrees> why not just use .then()
[15:44:19] <plexigras> ok robertmaxrees that looks like it would work but i think chaining them toghether is better is that posible ?
[15:44:29] <robertmaxrees> using .then() is preferred.
[15:44:37] <plexigras> ok
[15:53:05] <tash> I've got a .change() that I want to take some action when an option in a select box is chosen, but it only works once on the page.  Each select has the same id b/c I have no other way that I know of to accomplish what I'm trying to do.  When you click on one of the options all I'm doing at this point is grabbing the id of the nearest <td> and alerting it.  How can I get the .change() to work more than just the first time?
[15:57:37] <gambl0re> all of the sites on http://www.awwwards.com/ how are they doing those nice animation/transition effects?
[15:57:49] <SpecialTech> Just wanted to pop in here and say thanks for figuring out my issue before I even got to ask! Very helpful.
[15:58:39] <SpecialTech> Was in the process of coming up with a question and fiddle. Got to working on the fiddle and figured out my own issue
[16:01:02] <tash> https://jsfiddle.net/820tpvpL/2/ Sorry for the poorly crafted HTML, I inspected element and just copied the straight HTML since some of this content is generated dynamically.  Click on the select that says "Location" and choose Complete for example.  It alerts the nearest <td>'s id.  I want to then click on the next select and do the same thing, but the .change seems to only fire once. How can I get it to work on each of them?
[16:06:03] <plexigras> what is the best way to get undefined if a key of an obj does not exist and the value if it does?
[16:06:44] <NoiseEee> if(typeof someObj.somKey !=='undefined') { //the key exists }
[16:07:44] <plexigras> but i want to get undefined if the key doesnt exist and the value to return if he does
[16:08:22] <NoiseEee> plexigras: uh, you should be able to modify my line to do exactly what you need?
[16:08:48] <Munt> Hey folks i'm trying to get the selected value from a jqueryUI autocomplete box.  here's how Im doing it currently http://codepen.io/munt/pen/RajGby       if you type "pota" and select a value the alerted selection is "pota" instead of for example "one potato"  could you help me get the select value once the user has clicked on a search value ?
[16:09:53] <plexigras> NoiseEee, i was hoping i could do something like alert(urlParameters.find(({key}) => key === 'code').value || undefined)
[16:10:43] <NoiseEee> plexigras: write code you'll understand 2 months later. be xplicit
[16:11:58] <plexigras> i am just horible at asking questions sorry NoiseEee
[16:18:15] <YamakasY> heh no, I have data but get a objetct object and no way to trace it :S
[16:20:48] <plexigras> NoiseEee, short update: there was no problem. just me being stupid :/ alert((urlParameters.find(({key}) => key === 'code')||[]).value);
[16:21:43] <tash> I figured out my problem, but don't quite understand it. I just stumbled across a similar question online.
[16:22:47] <tash> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22684992/why-does-jquery-change-only-fires-once-inside-load-function My situation was very similar. So changing $('#thing').change(blah blah to $(document).on("change", '#thing', function(){ blah fixed it ... not sure why though =\
[16:25:03] <fas3r> Hello
[16:28:06] <fas3r> I think I have a problem with jsvalidate, everytime it keeps throwing this error : http://pasteboard.co/2MyIaUTg.png  do you know a way to debug where could be the problem, if related to jsvalidate. Thanks by advance
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> tash pretty simple.
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> $('#thing') binds to that thing.  if you remove it and re-add it later, the binding is lost because the original element is gone.
[16:29:47] <robertmaxrees> the delegated listener, though, still works, because you're bound to the document, not te element directly.
[16:53:21] <skinux> Is ReactJS really needed in order to do what ReactJS does (minus the virtual DOM)?
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> react is one of many toolsets that handles the view layer.
[16:56:08] <skinux> One thing I don't like abut React, is that it seems in order to add or remove an entry from a list of entries, you have to reload all of them.
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> that's the idea.
[16:56:35] <robertmaxrees> stateless.
[16:57:03] <skinux> Well, what if someone is at a scroll position, they'll have to do their scrolling again, which could be annoying.
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:57:14] <robertmaxrees> why would they do it again?
[16:58:04] <robertmaxrees> you're not redoing the entire page.
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> the diffing engine only replaces the things that actually changed.
[16:59:19] <skinux> So, if the list is long enough to require scrolling, a change wont effect their position in the listing?
[16:59:27] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[16:59:30] <skinux> Okay.
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the diffing engine and the virtual dom with the actual dom.
[17:00:11] <skinux> I've also got to figure out how to do a component for the selected option of a select menu without having to put an if condition inside each option.
[17:02:04] <skinux> Does this require RequireJS? var React = require('react');
[17:10:15] <albedoa> https://jsfiddle.net/o92oeeuu/ this is working well for my implementation. now i want to pass another value into hasValue and am striking out any way i try. how do i do that?
[17:22:34] <shoky> albedoa: this works https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/o92oeeuu/1/

[17:42:41] <islalobo> I'm updating an input field value once user has selected query from typeahead autocomplete "$('input[name="din"]').val(suggestionObject.din);": https://jsfiddle.net/sq3wge1u/
[17:43:15] <islalobo> The input field is updated, but on submit the input is not picked up. It's a required field so the form does not pass validation.
[17:51:32] <islalobo> Figured it out!
[17:51:42] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[19:20:11] <Sal> can someone tell me what wrong here: http://img04.imgland.net/kw9MAEs.png
[19:20:26] <Sal> why am i getting an empty array?
[19:21:12] <Sal> the div is present and its the one on first line
[19:28:31] <yurakeshi> Sal, '^' is for starting with attribute. your ow-layout-scroll isn't the first class of the element.
[19:29:23] <yurakeshi> change it to '~', that will check if class contains 'ow-layout-scroll-' in any where of the class attribute, not only the begining
[19:31:11] <yurakeshi> Sal, sorry, actually you need '*'
[19:31:18] <Sal> oh, its works on the entire string
[19:31:33] <Sal> ok, i thought i would make a search in an array of classes
[19:31:43] <Sal> ok, thanks
