[00:17:34] <chatgirl> good morning
[00:17:40] <chatgirl> anyone here?
[00:18:05] <Darkingz> chatgirl: what up
[00:18:15] <chatgirl> i need help with my page
[00:19:03] <chatgirl>   I have some websites I built times ago, that use jquery mouse events...I just got an ipad and i noticed that all the mouse over events are translated in clicks...so for instance i have to do two clicks instead of one..(the first hover, than the actual click)  is there a workaround ready to solve this? maybe a jquery command i shoudl have used instead of mouseover/out etc.. thanks!
[00:20:08] <Darkingz> chatgirl: well you can put this code into your html: <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1">
[00:20:20] <Darkingz> what you're seeing is that the browser will try to zoom in
[00:20:44] <Darkingz> here's a good tutorial on why: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag--webdesign-5972
[00:21:12] <chatgirl> yes it zoom in
[00:23:13] <chatgirl> the thing is....
[00:23:53] <chatgirl> i have some elements tha you can choose by clicking. on desktop there is a mousover effect
[00:24:13] <chatgirl> but on iphone and ipad it just dont work
[00:24:16] <Darkingz> wll you can't have a "mouseover" event fire in the browser
[00:24:20] <Darkingz> on mobile
[00:24:23] <Darkingz> there is no such thing
[00:24:55] <flxfdr> you have an touchmove event for mobile
[00:25:03] <Darkingz> there's a touchmove?
[00:25:09] <flxfdr> yes
[00:25:20] <chatgirl> no i dont :(
[00:25:25] <chatgirl> whats that
[00:25:28] <flxfdr> touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel
[00:25:34] <Darkingz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Touch_events
[00:25:41] <chatgirl> sory i am a noooob :/
[00:26:13] <flxfdr> its the same like a click-event for your desktop, but for mobile devices there is no click-event, only a "touch" event
[00:26:41] <flxfdr> for desktop for example: jQuery('.your-class-name').on('click', function() { alert('Test'); });
[00:26:49] <flxfdr> for mobile for example: jQuery('.your-class-name').on('touchmove', function() { alert('Test'); });
[00:26:52] <Darkingz> flxfdr: that does not seem to be a reasonable alternative to a touchmove though
[00:26:58] <Darkingz> i mean a mouseover
[00:27:53] <flxfdr> well... touchstart sounds for me like a good alternative for click
[00:28:04] <Darkingz> for click but not mouseover
[00:28:25] <Darkingz> i'd rather just add that html i gave earlier if you're just looking to prevent the zooming
[00:29:49] <chatgirl> but its not working @darkingz
[00:30:21] <Darkingz> i'd rather just add that html i gave earlier if you're just looking to prevent the zooming
[00:30:24] <Darkingz> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no" />
[00:31:06] <Darkingz> you're putting it in the head section right?
[00:32:30] <chatgirl> https://saucelabs.com/scout/live/70b2e1f244d64be5889ab7dae0d5f20f
[00:32:40] <chatgirl> here is a live share
[00:32:58] <chatgirl> sorry for the adult images, but this is a prject
[00:33:35] <chatgirl> the idea is, to pic via click 4 topic then you will lead to a second page
[00:34:09] <Darkingz> hmmm
[00:36:04] <chatgirl> @darkingz, can you help me?
[00:36:12] <Darkingz> chatgirl: i can't get through to the url
[00:37:25] <chatgirl> http://www.leckerficken.de/?mlp=15&domain=1100034&ct=cr01cb&idgirl=none&ly=none&WMID=87968&pid=3129-6HVG&camp=DE_WigetMedia_PopUn_RON_Mainstream&bid=LG_LP_cr01cb_ML15_html&crotag=PopUnder_CPM_Mainstream&site=213314&mpt=1405191706
[00:37:29] <chatgirl> thats the url
[00:37:37] <chatgirl> sorry for the content
[00:37:48] <chatgirl> on desktop it works well
[00:38:02] <Darkingz> the meta tag is there
[00:38:03] <chatgirl> but on ipad and iphone it doesnt work :(
[00:38:08] <Darkingz> but commented out?
[00:38:21] <chatgirl> sorry?
[00:51:22] <thesuss> Darkingz:  Any clue on my problem? It is at http://hlt-newsletter.wm3.se/karta/ - In all my browsers its messed up on first visit, but then it works well after a resize of the window, and I dont know if its a JQ, JS or leaflet problem... Also the image "pins" are no-show on mobiles, unsure as to why.
[00:54:21] <flam_> is there some channel for the "end-users" of bootstrap? (not bootstrap devs)
[00:59:59] <Darkingz> flam_: why?
[01:00:33] <flam_> what do you mean why?
[01:01:09] <Darkingz> well i mean the "end-users" of bootstrap is a bit loose
[01:01:17] <Darkingz> do you mean the actual users
[01:01:17] <flam_> like i'm using bootstrap framework in my project(s) and would like to chat about it but i'm not developing the framework itself
[01:01:32] <flam_> no, people who are developing with it but not developing _it_
[01:01:43] <Darkingz> bootstrap chanel can answer any questions
[01:01:48] <Darkingz> but what question do you have?
[01:02:04] <FilipNortic> flam_: do you mean that the ordinary bootstrap channel is for devs?
[01:02:23] <Darkingz> the ordinary one is for devs who both work on and with
[01:02:33] <Darkingz> ##bootstrap
[01:04:08] <flam_> thanks
[01:42:41] <airdem> i have a problem in chrome. the middle mouse click to open in new tab is not working on links within a jquery dialog. is this a common issue? any ideas how to fix it?
[01:43:14] <airdem> instead of opening in a new tab it opens in the same window
[01:43:22] <airdem> CTRL+left click has the same behavior
[01:52:25] <lidw> Hi
[02:44:43] <mdev> i'm passing a form name as a string but in a variable to a function and trying to use it in $.post("test", { variable: val})
[02:44:56] <mdev> but no matter what I do it sends it as "variable" for the request, not tis value
[02:45:20] <mdev> tried var variable = $("#"+passed_this).attr('id');
[02:45:30] <mdev> and all kinds of stuff
[02:47:03] <xec> mdev: can you show us your code?
[02:47:18] <RizziCR> hi
[02:49:40] <mdev> $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[02:49:50] <mdev> I just need the value of name to be sent as its name
[02:49:57] <mdev> not name in itself as the string sent
[02:50:51] <mdev> like var name = 'blah';
[02:50:52] <mdev> then
[02:50:59] <mdev>  $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[02:51:10] <mdev> and it sends blah: "John" etc...
[02:51:23] <xec> i see
[02:51:36] <xec> you want a variable key in the object
[02:51:47] <mdev> sure
[02:52:02] <skullcrasher> is it possible to connect multiple sortables in the way they act equally?
[02:52:15] <skullcrasher> so if i sort in one, the others get sorted accordingly
[02:52:24] <xec> you could do var name = "blah"; var myObj = {}; myObj[name] = "whatever";
[02:52:39] <mdev> ok thanks
[02:52:42] <xec> mdev: then myObj.blah would be "whatever"
[02:53:12] <mdev> seems like lot of steps, all 3 needed?
[02:53:28] <RizziCR> {„“+name: „John“…..} should also work i think
[02:54:27] <xec> RizziCR: no
[02:55:14] <xec> ""+name would not be a valid key for an object literal
[02:55:46] <xec> mdev: the only way i know to create a dynamic key is with [] notation
[02:56:48] <RizziCR> ok..
[02:56:50] <airdem> how can i add the jquery UI library to a js fiddle?
[02:57:02] <xec> airdem: there's a dropdown on the left
[02:57:45] <airdem> i cant find jqueryUI in the drop down on the left "Frameworks & Extensions"
[02:58:24] <RizziCR> i think that object keys can also be a string
[02:58:24] <airdem> or do i have to feed "External Resources" with the url to jqueryui.js and its css ?
[02:58:59] <xec> airdem: if you select one of the (edge) versions of jquery there's a checkbox for jquery ui underneath
[02:59:15] <xec> but the css still needs to be external resource iirc
[02:59:16] <airdem> ah okay i have to select a specific version, thank you
[02:59:33] <mdev> $.post("test", {myObj.blah: val})
[02:59:39] <mdev> complains about the .
[03:00:02] <xec> mdev: after you've created the object, just pass it as is
[03:00:10] <xec> $.post("test", myObj)
[03:00:44] <mdev> ok thanks
[03:01:33] <xec> RizziCR: yes. "test" is a string but "test" + "something" is an expression
[03:02:17] <RizziCR> ok.. thanks for explaining.. ;)
[03:05:06] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/ TypeError: $dialog.dialog is not a function
[03:05:08] <airdem> why?
[03:06:51] <mdev> ok that fixed it, you're very clever one more thing, can I pass other values with it
[03:07:21] <mdev> like $.post("test",myObjb, {test: value, test2:value2})
[03:07:37] <mdev> because that errors, tried moving the comment and the {}
[03:07:51] <mdev> and having no comment between myObjb and {
[03:07:55] <mdev> comma
[03:08:07] <xec> mdev: just pass it in with the same object (not two separate ones)
[03:08:22] <mdev> how do I do that? tried
[03:08:27] <xec> myOjb.test = value; myOjb.test2 = value2;
[03:08:36] <xec> then $.post("test", myObj)
[03:08:38] <mdev> ahh ok thanks
[03:08:46] <mdev> very cool, thanks for being so clever
[03:09:09] <xec> i got a typo there but you get the idea
[03:10:05] <xec> airdem: i dunno to be honest, haven't used jquery ui in jsfiddle in a while, maybe external resources is a better bet after all
[03:11:40] <mdev> works woot
[03:12:56] <paulvd> Hello, If you go to this url http://tinyurl.com/mbq8thp on chrome, you will see an error in Chrome "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" but I am unable to see which line of code is giving that error?
[03:14:03] <airdem> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/5/ if you click on "go to jsfiddle" youll get a same origin error
[03:14:29] <airdem> how can i prevent this. i need to test smth by loading the link destination into the dialofg
[03:15:06] <airdem> forget what ive said
[03:15:14] <airdem> you can still test it now, so my problem is:
[03:15:59] <airdem> in firefox you can use middle mouse or ctrl+left mouse to open the "go to jsfiddle" link in a new tab http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/5/
[03:16:07] <airdem> but on chrome nothing happens
[03:16:11] <airdem> any idea why?
[03:17:12] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/6/ i have added another link
[03:17:39] <airdem> you can middle click or ctrl left click on that link "go to google" in chrome and it works (opens in new tab)
[03:17:59] <airdem> why does the same not work for the first link? (in chrome)
[03:18:03] <xec> seems to be the preventDefault() call preventing it
[03:18:59] <airdem> yeah it has nothing to do with jqueryUI dialog
[03:19:02] <xec> why it only prevents in chrome i don't know
[03:20:02] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/8/ behaves the same way
[03:22:08] <xec> as does http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/9/
[03:22:16] <xec> so nothing to do with jquery basically ;)
[03:23:39] <airdem> "event.preventDefault is supposed to prevent the default action from happening. In this case, opening a new link. So, this is not a bug."
[03:23:50] <airdem> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47406
[03:23:55] <airdem> seems like chrome devs want it that way
[03:25:22] <xec> yeah, i was reading the same thing :)
[03:26:24] <xec> it seems middle mouse click does not trigger click event in firefox
[03:26:47] <xec> or IE for that matter
[03:27:10] <workthrick> hello, I'm running into issues with jquery-transit and .position(). Specifically, I'm getting wrong output in which the *first* call to .position() after a {top, left} transition returns the old position. The second time I call it, I get the new position
[03:29:29] <workthrick> is it a known problem? Or else, is there a specific event I could await to make sure it will be correct? I'm running the callbacks which get things wrong inside Angular watches, so I'm not exactly sure on the timing of things wrt. jQuery's view of the world
[03:29:59] <airdem> xec, there i fexed it, lol http://jsfiddle.net/2xyt9/15/
[03:30:02] <airdem> *fixed
[03:30:36] <xec> yeah that would do the trick :)
[03:30:38] <workthrick> ah damn, I think it might be the thing where ng-animate breaks things again :\
[03:31:04] <airdem> xec, thank you for your support
[03:31:14] <workthrick> calling it from a timeout with $duration delay gives correct results
[03:31:57] <paulvd> Hello, If you go to this url http://tinyurl.com/mbq8thp on chrome, you will see an error in Chrome "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" but I am unable to see which line of code is giving that error?
[03:33:47] <djam90> Hi, I have this code: superbox.append(superboximg).append(superboxclose).append(hidden);   and it is appending those 3 items to the superbox element. However, it is NOT always in THAT order! Sometimes it puts the hidden at the start, sometimes at the end!
[03:33:50] <airdem> how can i get the code of the pressed key inside a click function?
[03:34:10] <airdem> or check what key is pressed dureing a click event
[03:34:33] <djam90> If I have element.append(item1).append(item2).append(item3) does it always do it in that order? left to right? or what?
[03:35:01] <xec> djam90: i would assume so, do you have a demo where it's happening?
[03:35:06] <mooncup> I would assume left to right
[03:36:25] <xec> airdem: key as in keyboard?
[03:36:30] <airdem> yes
[03:36:39] <airdem> i need to know if CTRL is pressed during a click event
[03:36:49] <djam90> I have a "sort of" demo on a working site where it is dodgy... http://goo.gl/Y7y5m4  click on some of the images. In the div that opens up below, the image, the X in the corner and the text on the right is being appended
[03:36:57] <djam90> However they are not always appended in the correct orderr
[03:38:20] <xec> airdem: event.ctrlKey is a boolean
[03:38:39] <djam90> hmm, never mind, think it is an issue on my end, not actual jquery .append
[03:38:41] <djam90> my bad
[03:39:03] <airdem> xec, thats pretty good, did not find it via google, thanks again mate!
[03:39:39] <xec> yw :)
[03:48:56] <jop008> anyone used anchor as free text editor?
[03:51:16] <lilsammy> anyone come across a plugin which displays the week as a small calendar with the ability to toggle the hours of the day like the utorrent scheduler?
[03:51:52] <lilsammy> this type of thing: http://dl.maximumpc.com/galleries/20bittorrent/Scheduler2.jpg
[03:55:22] <paulvd> no one knows?
[03:55:46] <lilsammy> paulvd what was your question?
[03:57:31] <workthrick> paulvd: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[03:57:32] <workthrick> 	
[03:57:34] <workthrick> inerepairs.com/wp/locations/?id=" + zip +"&radius=" + radius" );
[03:57:52] <workthrick> try running it in firebug, it shows exactly where it sees the error\
[03:58:10] <workthrick> line 116
[04:16:27] <doebi> does jquery provide a method to encode an JS object in JSON?
[04:16:48] <doebi> i only seem to find getJSON() and parseJSON()
[04:20:02] <paulvd> workthrick: yes but i dont see any error in line 116
[04:22:37] <paulvd> even if i remove that entire js, i still see it is showing line 116
[04:22:47] <paulvd> and in chrome, it shows a blank space
[04:22:48] <paulvd> nothing else
[04:23:47] <Horacsio> $( '.texto1' ).delay( 600 ).css({opacity:0}).animate({opacity:1,'bottom': ‘-=10px'},750); why the animation doesnt work?
[04:24:24] <workthrick> paulvd: there's " after radius
[04:24:34] <workthrick> ie. it says radius"
[04:24:39] <workthrick> that is clearly not rught
[04:24:59] <Horacsio> http://bias.baannng.com/
[04:28:52] <dewp> hey guys, is someone familiar with jqplot?
[04:30:36] <FernandoBasso> I am not.
[04:30:41] <dewp> i'm a bit, but not really. the same is for arrays. i imported a csv-file into an arrray and parsing it
[04:30:53] <dewp> the problem i experience is, that the array is "shifted" by one
[04:31:02] <dewp> it's starting at 1, not at 0
[04:31:13] <dewp> maybe it's a general problem.
[04:31:49] <dewp> http://csvtest.cwsurf.de thats my test setup
[04:32:08] <dewp> (click to load my sample csv: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26789642/test.csv )
[04:32:31] <dewp> http://pastebin.com/BfvfzbUi that's my code
[04:33:41] <dewp> it seems kind of be stretched as it is not ending by 10 but by 11
[04:33:51] <dewp> hmm. maybe somebody knows
[04:34:22] <Horacsio> why this somehow works $( '.texto1' ).delay( 600 ).css({opacity:0}).animate({opacity:1,'marginTop': '+=10px'},750); and the Top feature does nothing?
[04:34:59] <Horacsio> $( '.texto1' ).delay( 600 ).css({opacity:0}).animate({opacity:1,'Top': '+=10px'},750);
[04:37:53] <Horacsio> can someone help?
[04:38:50] <Horacsio> please? :)
[04:49:24] <workthrick> Horacsio: it seems like it should be 'top', not 'Top'
[04:52:48] <jop008> good tip for a programming text edtior within the browser? No software install needed
[04:53:40] <flam_> why do you need something like that?

[05:36:53] <viknesh> is jquery mobile responsive ?? when i resize the window , the text dont wrap :(
[06:08:25] <palzie> hey, i have this jquery working on mozilla http://puu.sh/avUgu/3cb886606b.png --- thing is that i'd like it to work aswell on chrome, any clue why/solution ?
[06:11:07] <Horacsio> member:workthrick: it seems like caps wont matters :D but thanks
[06:14:11] <Horacsio> why opacity works but movement doesnt? :(
[06:15:48] <viknesh> is jquery mobile responsive ?? when i resize the window , the text dont wrap :(
[06:16:37] <BillCriswell> viknesh: Do you have it in a div with an absolute width set?
[06:16:49] <Ringing> Anyone know how to get this scroll bar to always be visisble? http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/21/
[06:18:07] <BillCriswell> Ringing: Let me see if I can get through the documentation without gagging.
[06:18:23] <Ringing> That'd be great thanks
[06:18:26] <Ringing> I'm looking through it too
[06:19:14] <viknesh> BillCriswell: u mean position:absolute ??
[06:19:42] <viknesh> BillCriswell: here is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vhVvt/2/
[06:20:21] <viknesh> click on the first list ,it opens a new file with a C program , but its not responsive
[06:20:49] <BillCriswell> Ringing: There's no option for it, you'd have to modify the actual code.
[06:21:34] <Ringing> ive been trying to change the dependant css file
[06:21:43] <Ringing> changing any opacity: 0 I could see
[06:21:44] <BillCriswell> Ringing: When you hover over ps-scrollbar-x|y-rail it makes the background color of the actual slider white.
[06:22:10] <viknesh> BillCriswell: and why dont the text on the list wrap , when resized
[06:22:18] <BillCriswell> Ringing: You're loooking for like .ps-scrollbar-y-rail:hover ps-scrollbar-y { background-color: #aaa; }

[06:22:53] <hlvwrk> khnhkjb,hnm;khjnmcbcxbdlkbnd BillCriswell
[06:23:09] <hlvwrk> hi
[06:23:42] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: It's for a plugin.
[06:23:53] <BillCriswell> viknesh: It's in a <pre> tag.
[06:24:17] <BillCriswell> Making code samples responsive is going to drive everyone nuts. Wrap it in a div with overflow scroll
[06:24:37] <Horacsio> Oh perfect scrollbar…
[06:25:08] <viknesh> BillCriswell: but there is a <div> above <pre>
[06:25:58] <viknesh> sorry if i ask silly question :(
[06:35:13] <palzie> sorry to reiterate but i have this jquery working on mozilla http://puu.sh/avUgu/3cb886606b.png --- thing is that i'd like it to work aswell on chrome, any clue why/solution ?
[06:36:39] <BillCriswell> Ringing: http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/22/
[06:37:49] <BillCriswell> viknesh: You need to wrap the <pre> in a <div> with overflow: auto or something.
[06:38:31] <BillCriswell> So <div data-role="content" class="ui-content" role="main"><div style="overflow: auto"><pre>...</pre></div></div>
[06:38:50] <BillCriswell> Then that way they can scroll right without scrolling the rest of the site out of view.
[06:41:27] <BillCriswell> palzie: What's "work"?
[06:42:02] <palzie> BillCriswell: well, the "if" content, so the 0 min-height and the following line
[06:43:29] <BillCriswell> I'd do console.log(menuH, mainContentH, footerH); and make sure they're the same in both browsers.
[06:44:39] <viknesh1> BillCriswell: thanks , but it just adds the scrollbar , text dont wrap
[06:45:40] <BillCriswell> viknesh1: If you want the text to wrap... which will make that area a shit hole, you'd have to do:  pre.classThatCodeIsIn { white-space: normal; }
[06:46:45] <viknesh1> BillCriswell: so we need to hardcode ?? jquery dont do that  ??
[06:51:29] <BillCriswell> viknesh1: pre tags preserve white space.
[06:51:53] <BillCriswell> You can use a tag that's not <pre>.
[06:52:19] <BillCriswell> but breaking lines is the exact opposite of preserving white space.
[06:52:24] <drej> BillCriswell im always impressed at your relentless patience
[06:53:35] <BillCriswell> Haha. I'm sure I put #web through hell in my earlier years. Giving it back!
[06:53:55] <BillCriswell> Earlier years being like... 12 years ago. ='(
[06:54:05] <viknesh1> BillCriswell: oh sorry , yeah it preserves spaces , i forgot it :(
[06:54:12] <BillCriswell> viknesh1: All good!
[06:54:28] <viknesh1> BillCriswell: thanks :)
[06:55:38] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:08:20] <cael_gomes> Hello. I have 5 distinct classes, with same prefix eg. disc-product, disc-notebook, disc-tablet, disc-smartphone, and so on. I want to build a selector which returns all but two classes eg. returns all elements but disc-product and disc-notebook.
[07:08:40] <cael_gomes> Is it possible to achieve without 3rd party libs?
[07:08:57] <cael_gomes> I got it working as $("[class^='disc']").filter("[class!='disc-product']").filter("[class!='disc-smartphone']")
[07:09:06] <cael_gomes> not so sure ig there's a better way
[07:09:30] <cael_gomes> 3rd party plugins*
[07:12:27] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: You can use filter and inArray.
[07:13:01] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: I would put a class of "disc" on all of thoese elements as well to make the selector better and do...
[07:13:14] <threecatstwodogs> Hi, I'm looking for a better way to do this: http://pastebin.com/8rjZP5wN , basically I do an ajax call for form fields and then create a form. I'm sure someone else has already done this, does anyone know of some examples ?
[07:14:40] <BillCriswell> $('.disc').filter(function() { var $this = $(this); return $this.hasClass('disc-foo') || $this.hasClass('disc-bar'); });
[07:15:14] <BillCriswell> Just realized the inArray wouldn't work because ou have multiple classes if you do class="disc disc-smartphone"
[07:15:56] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: I thought about that, but a js delegate isn't slower than jquery "native" selector? just wondering..
[07:16:30] <BillCriswell> A simple class selector would probably use document.getElementsByClassName() which would make it faster.
[07:17:35] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: If you're cool with using $('[class^=foo]') you can do $('[class^=foo]').filter(function(){ return $.inArray(this.className, ['class-one', 'class-two']) > -1; });
[07:18:18] <krambiorix> hi, i use $(myelement).width(175) on a table cell. I see in firebug that the tablecell has a style with width 175px but it's much less width than 175 ... What can be the cause of this?
[07:18:32] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: the best scenario wouldn't be a way to $("[class^='disc']  <AND> [class!='disc-product']" <AND> [class!='disc-smartphone']"). Do you know if there's any way to do that in one selector?
[07:19:07] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: so jquery would apply those three conditions ONCE in each element?
[07:19:43] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: That's really inefficient. I think you could do $('[class^=disc][class!=disc-product][class!=disc-foo]')
[07:20:12] <BillCriswell> Using one class name and filter would be quickest.
[07:20:17] <BillCriswell> AFAIK.
[07:20:43] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: if jquery filter the elements by the first condition, that would be O(n) n being the qty of "disc-*" elements, I think.
[07:21:26] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: But probably it won't, so it will apply the three selectors in ALL elements, which I agree with you, it's really inefficient.
[07:22:32] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: You're really limiting what you can do with the html the way you're approaching it. You can't add classes to any of the disc-* elements or those selectors will break.
[07:23:42] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: please explain it better. You are saying that if a element has two classes, it won't appear in the final resultset?
[07:23:47] <viknesh1> BillCriswell: yeah it wraps the line when i add white-space property , which makes it difficult to read , when i use </br> indentation in the code is not preserved . So how do i preserve indentation and make it responsive
[07:26:14] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: If i have <div class="foo bar baz"> and I do  [class!=bar] that div will still match.
[07:27:45] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: http://jsbin.com/pewusije/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:28:34] <decx> i know i'm late a day of work when i get to my computer and BillCriswell is already helping people
[07:28:43] <decx> to a*
[07:29:15] <BillCriswell> I'm sure you'll make up for it by messing around with some fun code for 6 hours haha.
[07:30:04] <decx> very likely
[07:30:16] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6DmN7/
[07:30:48] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: Make sense?
[07:30:51] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: Thank you. I believe that wouldn't be a problem to me, because the elements has style-related only classes and "functional js-related classes", so that would still work for me. Not sure if I made myself clear. The point is, that's OK if matches elements with more classes in my case.
[07:31:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice. I thought I was supposed to land on the red.
[07:31:34] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: eg. <div class="rounded-element disc-product another-fancy-class">
[07:31:41] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: But [class!=bar] would still match <div class="foo bar baz">
[07:32:54] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: http://jsbin.com/pewusije/2/edit?html,js,output there we go, that example is much clearer than the other one.
[07:32:58] <BillCriswell> Don't know what I was thinking.
[07:33:16] <decx> BillCriswell it isnt? i'm thinking comically large blood splatters make everything better
[07:33:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Always. Especially in real life.
[07:33:52] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: http://jsbin.com/pewusije/3/edit? even clearer.
[07:34:13] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: Definitely not intuitive, eh?
[07:39:16] <[1]ChoboBill> hello, any web designers here?
[07:39:39] <decx> we're all frontend enginieers now
[07:40:06] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: yeah, got it.http://jsbin.com/pewusije/3/
[07:40:30] <[1]ChoboBill> ok, just wanted some advice
[07:40:51] <[1]ChoboBill> I'm looking to head into a career in web design and am looking to get my portfolio site up and running
[07:41:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Is that what I am?
[07:41:24] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: Sweet.
[07:41:36] <[1]ChoboBill> I'm looking to have the site responsive and was wondering what is the best framework for this?
[07:41:44] <ringing> Hey guys, I still can't manage to get my perfect scroll bar to appear not hidden on page load. I figured out how to keep it not hidden after it gets activated though (that was just adjusting the perfectscrollbar.css file. Is there a way to keep it active at the start? http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/21/
[07:41:45] <BillCriswell> cael_gomes: I just didn't want that sneaking up and biting you in the ass later, cause I'm sure it would happen to me.
[07:41:47] <decx> BillCriswell sure why not, upper management can make up titles so why cant we
[07:42:10] <BillCriswell> [1]ChoboBill: CSS
[07:42:37] <BillCriswell> ringing: Sent you think link like an hour ago: http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/22/
[07:42:52] <BillCriswell> I mean... I'm from the future.
[07:43:04] <decx> where's my damn hoverboard
[07:43:22] <[1]ChoboBill> BillCriswell: so your saying to hard code it in instead of a framework like bootstrap or skeleton?
[07:43:37] <cael_gomes> BillCriswell: haha yeah, you are absolutelly right, my friend. :)
[07:43:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Not from that far into the future.
[07:43:41] <ringing> Oh, thank you
[07:43:44] <BillCriswell> Only like 15 minutes.
[07:43:46] <drej> [1]ChoboBill if youre putting together a site that shows your web dev skills, then use your webdev skills?
[07:43:50] <drej> instead of using a framework
[07:44:38] <BillCriswell> [1]ChoboBill: Is the site already built? What kind of requirements are there? Do you need all of what bootstrap or skeleton has to offer? There's a whole lot of ifs before picking the "best" framework.
[07:45:12] <[1]ChoboBill> BillCriswell: site will be pretty basic, only 3 or 4 main pages with portfolio links
[07:45:38] <[1]ChoboBill> drej: in regards to web designers, will I have to focus on coding aswell, or could I go pure design only?
[07:45:45] <BillCriswell> I think bootstrap would be completely overkill for that.
[07:46:37] <[1]ChoboBill> drej: I have some internship experience as a front-end dev, but would prefer to focus on design
[07:47:22] <BillCriswell> Skeleton is pretty sweet... it's not mobile first and it's not fluid, but I think it's the less of the two evils for a project like this.
[07:47:43] <nisseni> is there a way with jquery to activate the keyboard upon document.ready?
[07:48:19] <BillCriswell> nisseni: What do you mean?
[07:48:46] <decx> $(function() { $.pluginKeyboard({ letsget: 'physical' }) })
[07:48:48] <nisseni> BillCriswell: geez, that's not good explanation. I mean when entering with a mobile phone. So that the keyboard pops up when the site is loaded
[07:49:12] <decx> focus an input
[07:49:16] <BillCriswell> nisseni: Autofocus maybe?
[07:49:21] <nisseni> tried that, doesn't work
[07:49:24] <BillCriswell> I wonder if that would work. It would annoy me haha.
[07:49:29] <BillCriswell> haha ok good.
[07:49:47] <BillCriswell> I have no idea then. I'd have to mess around with it. What have you tried besides that?
[07:51:08] <relipse> I have a <table> at the bottom of a long page, as long as a certain condition is met, I want to always show the table at the bottom of the screen until the user scrolls down to where the table is already, then it should go into place, any ideas how to accomplish this?
[07:51:32] <dianan> Greetings! I'm using jQuery-ui for a tabbed effect to create a wizard-type interface for a multi-page entry form. And using jQuery.validate to make sure fields are entered before advancing when they click the next button. It all works great. But the validations don't run if the user clicks the tabs to move between pages. Any ideas how to invoke the validations when the user clicks the tabs?
[07:51:38] <nisseni> BillCriswell: didn't play around that much, to be honest
[07:51:54] <nisseni> might be something in jquerymobile, haven't looked
[07:52:06] <BillCriswell> My first thought would maybe be a setTimeout with a focus?
[07:52:40] <BillCriswell> relipse: Like a sticky table? Stays where it is till you scroll to it then sticks to the top of the screen?
[07:53:00] <relipse> BillCriswell, yes I believe so
[07:53:13] <BillCriswell> I'd google "javascript stick elements"
[07:53:15] <BillCriswell> sticky*
[07:53:48] <relipse> http://stickyjs.com/ <-- will this do it?
[07:54:01] <relipse> the table is at the bottom of the page though and if the user selected something i want to show it
[07:54:15] <dmsuperman> relipse: you tell us, does that page do what you want to have happen?
[07:54:27] <blakespot> Are conditionals like this valid?
[07:54:32] <relipse> dmsuperman, not exactly but  i think its the right idea
[07:54:32] <BillCriswell> relipse: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216114/how-can-i-make-a-div-stick-to-the-top-of-the-screen-once-its-been-scrolled-to
[07:54:33] <blakespot> if($(this).css("background") != "blue") { ... }
[07:55:04] <dmsuperman> blakespot: that's a valid conditional but I expect that won't work how you want
[07:55:05] <BillCriswell> blakespot: Yes, just make sure $(this).css('background') is returning what you think.
[07:55:14] <dmsuperman> you want background-color and it probably won't return "blue"
[07:55:24] <relipse> BillCriswell, i'm actually looking to show the <table> if the user selects a quantity, and then when the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page it goes back into its place
[07:55:30] <blakespot> I need to check if max-height is set to 1000px or not specifically
[07:55:31] <BillCriswell> I think it'll return rgb(0,0,255);
[07:55:43] <blakespot> that was just an example
[07:56:00] <BillCriswell> blakespot: console.log($(this).css('someProp'));
[08:08:54] <converge> can someone help me here ? http://paste2.org/nvpd2sC0
[08:09:03] <converge> Can't find whats wrong when returning the data
[08:09:25] <Woet> why are you using eval?
[08:09:37] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[08:10:00] <Woet> or http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ with json as dataType
[08:10:18] <Woet> also, use console.log on data to figure it out.
[08:15:38] <Trow> how to select the html content of an element inside a string variable ?
[08:16:13] <Trow> example i want to select '<p><a></a></p>' inside this var x= '<div><span><p><a></a></p></span></div>'
[08:16:57] <ringing> Hey, sorry to come back to you guys with my scroll problem but I can't seem to get it to always be there. I know you gave me an answer already but the problem on my site is a bit more complex. I replicated my problem that I have on my site http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/26/
[08:17:13] <ringing> it only happens because of the style: display: none property
[08:17:19] <ringing> I'm not sure how to go about fixing it
[08:17:54] <converge> Woet: it gives me an error exception when using datatype json
[08:18:38] <Es0teric> question about draggable and sortable… i want to make <li> items draggable and sortable… how does it work exactly? do i just call $(‘ul#blockSortable’).sortable(); then $(‘div#block’).draggable({connectToSortable: ‘#blockSortable’})
[08:18:39] <Es0teric> ?
[08:19:56] <BillCriswell> ringing: !important display block on the rail class.
[08:20:23] <ringing> BillCriswell: What?
[08:20:38] <thebope> lol
[08:20:38] <ringing> I need the display none to be there
[08:21:05] <ringing> i'm looking into alternatively using the hide() function which seems to solve the issue
[08:24:14] <BillCriswell> ringing: http://jsfiddle.net/TAkhM/27/
[08:24:56] <BillCriswell> ringing: The issue is it can't put the scroll bars in till it has a height.
[08:25:09] <BillCriswell> I think.
[08:25:12] <ringing> oh okay
[08:25:24] <ringing> so you added an important tag?
[08:25:26] <ringing> was that all?
[08:25:51] <BillCriswell> So, I just trigger a scroll event after the slideToggle has completed.
[08:26:11] <BillCriswell> Overriding that display none was being weird so I just did that instead.
[08:26:34] <ringing> Oh nice
[08:26:46] <ringing> I was thinking of doing that but didn't know what the scroll event syntax was
[08:26:48] <ringing> thanks
[08:27:06] <ringing> I should have just googled that though
[08:27:09] <ringing> I was thinking of the same things
[08:29:12] <BillCriswell> ringing: It's all good.
[08:29:40] <relipse> how do i detect when a certain element has been scrolled into view?
[08:31:36] <duch_kazatel> relipse attach a handler to the window's scroll event and see if the vertical offset of the element is within the current viewport.
[08:31:56] <BillCriswell> relipse: Look at the windows scrollTop an the elements position and comparse on scroll.
[08:32:10] <BillCriswell> relipse: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216114/how-can-i-make-a-div-stick-to-the-top-of-the-screen-once-its-been-scrolled-to this link from earlier pretty much handles it for you.
[08:33:04] <Es0teric> how is jquery draggable-sortable supposed to work? do i need to call draggable if i already have sortable?
[08:39:20] <Es0teric> anyone?
[08:39:52] <decx> it's quite extensively documented on the jquery ui documentation
[08:40:03] <decx> maybe like, you know, read it ^^
[08:41:23] <BillCriswell> A lot better to just read it and get it out of the way. It's like pulling off a band-aid.
[08:43:28] <thebope> If I have a bunch of TDs in a TR, can I come up from within one of the TDs and do a .each loop through the rest of the TDs?
[08:44:04] <thebope> I'm not sure if that makes sense but basically "<tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 3 </td> </tr>"
[08:44:22] <decx> loop through all tds in all trs or just the tds in that one tr
[08:44:30] <thebope> Just that one tr
[08:44:32] <thebope> but the thing is
[08:44:35] <decx> siblings()
[08:44:47] <thebope> I don't want the TDs that are before the TD I'm calling from
[08:44:52] <relipse> can I apply a class and then remove the class but fade it slowly?
[08:45:03] <decx> siblings filter
[08:45:13] <thebope> relipse, http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/fading/
[08:45:16] <thebope> these might be what you want
[08:45:24] <thebope> ahh yea that would make sense
[08:45:37] <relipse> i just want to fade out a border
[08:45:40] <relipse> back to normal
[08:45:42] <relipse> from green
[08:46:12] <Trow> hey
[08:46:15] <Trow> how to select the html content of an element inside a string variable ?
[08:46:19] <Trow> example i want to select '<p><a></a></p>' inside this var x= '<div><span><p><a></a></p></span></div>'
[08:46:59] <thebope> thanks decx, I've got to start employing filter more
[08:47:05] <thebope> its one of my least used jquery tricks
[08:47:08] <thebope> and its so useful
[08:47:48] <thebope> Trow, isn't there a JS function for indexOf("<p><a>")?
[08:48:24] <thebope> You could store the elements you're looking for as a variable
[08:48:30] <thebope> use indexOf(yourVariable)
[08:48:38] <thebope> then add the length of yourVariable to the index returned
[08:48:54] <thebope> to get the index of the first part of what is inside
[08:48:57] <thebope> and if you wanted a range
[08:49:30] <duch_kazatel> Trow convert the string to a fragment and go to down.
[08:49:31] <thebope> Something like x.substring(x.indexOf(yourVariable), x.indexOf(yourClosingTagVariable))
[08:49:47] <thebope> Is your solution better duch_kazatel ?
[08:49:48] <duch_kazatel> *to town
[08:49:52] <duch_kazatel> imo yes.
[08:49:57] <decx> $(x).find('p') ?
[08:49:59] <duch_kazatel> he wants HTML out of HTML
[08:50:05] <thebope> Whats a fragment?
[08:50:13] <duch_kazatel> $('<div><span><p><a></a></p></span></div>') makes a fragment.
[08:50:23] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment
[08:50:29] <thebope> Thanks
[08:50:32] <thebope> let me check that out
[08:51:32] <thebope> duch_kazatel, very cool, thanks I didn't know about that
[08:51:56] <duch_kazatel> lots of folks don't.
[08:52:04] <Trow> i can add an id to simplify the selection like <div><span><p id="sample"><a></a></p></span></div>
[08:52:14] <thebope> I would say that is certainly a substantially better solution
[08:52:14] <duch_kazatel> Trow same story.
[08:52:46] <thebope> Thats one of those things where you should just say yes and drop the imo ;-)
[08:53:00] <duch_kazatel> var x = '<div><span><p id="sample"><a></a></p></span></div>'; var $theSample = $(x).find('#sample');
[08:54:05] <duch_kazatel> the neat thing about fragments is you can operate against them like any other part of the DOM.
[08:55:10] <Trow> and if i have a class like '<div><span><p class="a b c d"><a></a></p></span></div>' is it possible to do $theSample = $(x).find('.a .b .c .d');
[08:55:11] <Trow> ?
[08:55:27] <duch_kazatel> Trow .find() can take any selector.
[08:55:34] <duch_kazatel> but in your case it'd be .a.b.c.d
[08:55:38] <decx> what'S the difference between createDocumentFragment and createElement anyway
[08:56:21] <valkedin> Hi all, do you mind take a look if there are anything I need to fix http://jsfiddle.net/3WEZe/
[08:57:31] <duch_kazatel> decx i... am not sure.  that'll be the thing i learn today!
[08:58:21] <decx> oh i know
[08:58:40] <duch_kazatel> i know that you interact with them differently and that fragments disappear after you append them.
[08:58:42] <decx> createElement creates an alement createDocumentFragment creates an open space
[08:58:49] <duch_kazatel> that makes sense.
[09:01:47] <BillCriswell> What's an open space?
[09:01:56] <decx> valkedin you dont want to fire all this on your change
[09:02:06] <decx> a space where you can append elements
[09:02:08] <duch_kazatel> a fragment - it's a document that you can't see.
[09:02:45] <valkedin> @decx, I am sorry, meaning ?
[09:02:47] <decx> similar to var string = ''; before you do a loop with string += i;
[09:03:09] <BillCriswell> So it's like.. an element you can put whatever you want in?
[09:03:18] <decx> valkedin for example you always show an element based on the vaalue even if it's not relevant
[09:03:22] <duch_kazatel> it's like a full document you can do whatever you want in.
[09:04:21] <Lindrian_> Is it possible to make div#a slide up and div#b take its place under at the exact same time?
[09:04:34] <Lindrian_> So for each pixel div#a moves up, so does div#b, to seamlessly take its place.
[09:05:04] <decx> like an accordion?
[09:05:36] <relipse> how do I do a background pulse
[09:05:44] <Lindrian_> decx: of sorts, yeah
[09:06:01] <Lindrian_> decx: but i dont need all of those fancy features, i just need a oneliner to do this, probably some funky animate() business
[09:06:02] <decx> use an accordion then ^^
[09:06:48] <decx> i like to have both elements at full height absolutely positioned in a masking div, and then moving up and down
[09:06:48] <Lindrian_> An accordion has headers and bla bla.
[09:06:58] <Lindrian_> right
[09:07:32] <decx> so you get the height of the upper element, and use that height to set the middle
[09:07:44] <decx> and from that middle you can control where you want to go
[09:08:35] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian_ why do you think you need a one-liner for this, when what you really want is an accordion?
[09:08:45] <decx> because accordion is ugly
[09:08:45] <duch_kazatel> one-liners are overrated imo.
[09:08:52] <Lindrian_> because *I* know what I want to do, and you don't.
[09:09:02] <decx> and always has that ugly step for content that flows under it
[09:09:04] <Lindrian_> decx is on the money.
[09:09:25] <duch_kazatel> i'm confused, but okay
[09:09:29] <Lindrian_> im just considering if slideUp() with a div under it that automatically slides up would work just as well.
[09:09:35] <decx> money money money money money money i'm standing on the ...
[09:11:03] <relipse> what is wrong with my code? nothing is happening to the background color:         $('#tblTotalCostProducts').animate( { backgroundColor: "#BBFFBB" }, 500)
[09:11:03] <relipse> .animate( { backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }, 2500 );
[09:12:33] <wunz> relipse: you can't animate background color
[09:12:50] <decx> use css() and transition
[09:13:11] <decx> or a class and transition
[09:13:16] <decx> either way, use transition
[09:13:55] <wunz> decx: that's only if he's using css3
[09:14:04] <relipse> how do i use transition?
[09:14:20] <wunz> relipse: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions

[09:18:22] <thebope> I got unrecognized expression
[09:18:40] <thebope> yea
[09:18:52] <BillCriswell> thebope: What are you trying to select? All tds besides the one you're in?

[09:19:25] <thebope> oh wow
[09:19:40] <thebope> Damn I'm about to just have my employer pay me to rtfm

[09:22:10] <BillCriswell> Aw yeah.
[09:22:17] <BillCriswell> Oh shit I think I just time traveled an hour.
[09:24:23] <decx> what was that helper method to do something on click and another thing on the next click
[09:24:29] <decx> was it toggle?
[09:24:40] <decx> toggler
[09:26:07] <Trow> i want to select the <a> from .sample with find in this example <div><span class="sample"><p><a></a></p></span></div>
[09:26:08] <Trow> shall id do find('.sample a') ?
[09:26:39] <decx> you've been asking the same thing that's been answered a few times already. dont be a help vampire
[09:27:33] <Trow> it s not the same
[09:28:10] <duch_kazatel> Trow yes it is.
[09:28:22] <duch_kazatel> all simple CSS style-selectors.
[09:28:25] <Trow> okay sorry
[09:28:56] <duch_kazatel> instead of asking what you should do, try.  if it doesn't work, play around.  if it still doesn't work, feel free to ask for help.

[09:30:26] <z0la> it's site i have three radio buttons
[09:30:57] <duch_kazatel> a small test case would be amazing.
[09:31:13] <z0la> wait a sec
[09:36:40] <decx> did somebody just solve their own problem in the act of making a testcase
[09:36:59] <z0la> here is paste
[09:36:59] <z0la> http://pastebin.com/3GZYWjBL
[09:37:00] <duch_kazatel> i hope.
[09:37:07] <duch_kazatel> :(
[09:37:10] <duch_kazatel> really?
[09:37:25] <decx> that's not a fiddle, that's a spacestation
[09:38:16] <duch_kazatel> "here are three really good services - a small test case would be great" - "rad well here's my entire page in none of those"
[09:38:41] <z0la> any idea?
[09:38:52] <duch_kazatel> z0la make a test case here: http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:42:27] <z0la> duch_kazatel bro u don't listen to me :P it works when i don't have theme for my radio buttons.
[09:42:41] <z0la> and it works on js fiddle because i can't import theme
[09:42:52] <duch_kazatel> "bro" i don't know what you're asking.
[09:43:47] <z0la> okey. i have this theme for my custom radiobuttons http://designmodo.com/futurico/
[09:43:56] <duch_kazatel> i give up.

[09:45:53] <z0la> is this so hard :P
[09:47:39] <duch_kazatel> let's make sure we're clear about the problem here: you have some custom theme applied to these radio buttons that breaks things.  you want me to figure out what's wrong with these radio buttons when said theming is applied, but you can't get me a test case with the theming applied.
[09:47:51] <duch_kazatel> you are effectively asking me to divine an answer for you.
[09:49:30] <z0la> i jsut want to fix thinks to works with theme :D
[09:49:38] <z0la> not that ungly system def
[09:49:58] <duch_kazatel> okay.  how do you expect me to help you if you can't get me a test case that breaks?
[09:50:42] <z0la> http://fronteed.com/iCheck/ download and folow instrustions and then copy my paste into same dir
[09:51:10] <duch_kazatel> so it's on github?

[09:55:16] <BillCriswell> Yes. They were charging me for something for like 10 years but never enrolled me properly.
[09:55:25] <duch_kazatel> z0la i can help if you setup a fiddle or bin that demonstrates the problem.  if somebody else wants to download it and do it for you, they're welcome to.
[09:55:30] <duch_kazatel> oh he left :(
[09:55:33] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell dizzamn
[09:55:37] <decx> good
[09:55:48] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell so you get money and more money
[09:55:59] <BillCriswell> Yes. It's especially nice close to pay day.
[09:56:17] <duch_kazatel> oh i'll bet!
[09:56:37] <MikeD_> any of you know RTF?
[09:56:44] <duch_kazatel> the file format?
[09:56:44] <BillCriswell> rick text format?
[09:56:48] <BillCriswell> rich*
[09:56:52] <MikeD_> yeah
[09:57:03] <duch_kazatel> rich, rick, same diff,.
[09:57:06] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:57:20] <MikeD_> some genius wrote an RTF to HTML translation... but they're not honoring the font-change in the RTF
[09:57:21] <duch_kazatel> mikau what's your question?
[09:57:31] <duch_kazatel> err, MikeD_
[09:58:11] <MikeD_> so i was wondering if there was some way I could wrap the fixed-width font directive in the RTF with something that would get styled correctly in a WYSIWYG html editor (like ckedit)
[09:58:12] <BillCriswell> Instead fo WYSIWYG people should just learn the EXTREME basics of HTML.
[09:58:46] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that's a bigger challenge than you'd think.
[09:58:53] <MikeD_> i'd like to say to the person who opened this ticket:  "Highlight, change font, done"  but i'm sure he'll whine that's too difficult
[09:58:57] <BillCriswell> I'd even take markdown!
[10:01:48] <jimi_> how can i find element with data-id="foo"   i tried $('.classname').find("[data-id='foo']"); but got 0 results
[10:02:01] <decx> filter not find
[10:02:19] <BillCriswell> jimi_: If you're looking for a <div class="classname" data-id="foo"> at least.
[10:02:39] <BillCriswell> Should try to avoid selecting by data attribute all together.
[10:02:57] <decx> eh, it's fine in a filter
[10:03:03] <decx> the footprint is already minimized
[10:03:16] <MikeD_> so it's ok to put all your data access into the classname?
[10:03:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, I was thinking more for $('[data-foo=bar]') cases.
[10:04:08] <decx> actually a pleasent surprise to see somebody preselecting with a class isnt it
[10:04:13] <decx> pleasant?
[10:04:16] <BillCriswell> It sure is.
[10:04:21] <BillCriswell> I think it's a.
[10:04:45] <decx> no i was giving up in a war
[10:04:47] <decx> plea sent
[10:05:10] <BillCriswell> Haha, makes sense.
[10:06:44] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[10:07:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Do you use a host file for like... fake domain stuff?
[10:07:53] <decx> sure
[10:08:28] <BillCriswell> How do you keep chrome from doing a search for the url instead of just trying to resolve it?
[10:08:56] <decx> there's an option somewhere to disable the search
[10:09:05] <BillCriswell> "Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar or the app launcher search box" this option looked promising but it didn't work.
[10:09:07] <BillCriswell> decx: Hmm
[10:09:23] <BillCriswell> I like the search though, I kind of just want it to try the url before searching haha
[10:09:23] <decx> would have to test
[10:09:47] <decx> well dont use a browser from a company that relies on you giving them anything you look for ^^
[10:10:08] <BillCriswell> haha but I love chrome.
[10:10:33] <BillCriswell> Even if I type out http://craft.dev/ fully it still searches for it instead of taking me there
[10:10:50] <BillCriswell> then it'll give me a gray bar "Did you mean to go to http://craft.dev/?"
[10:11:03] <BillCriswell> It's like, being an asshole to me.
[10:11:24] <decx> ah right
[10:11:27] <decx> do a slash
[10:11:30] <decx> word/
[10:11:39] <decx> wait wat?
[10:11:59] <BillCriswell> I don't know what you just did.
[10:12:27] <decx> trailing slash works for me in chrome
[10:12:52] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: http://superuser.com/a/354344/318980
[10:12:55] <BillCriswell> Is that really it.
[10:13:54] <marc_v92> Yeah, might be worth a feature request.
[10:14:04] <marc_v92> Would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut to override the search.
[10:14:06] <BillCriswell> decx: The / definitely works, sweet.
[10:14:15] <BillCriswell> marc_v92: Thanks for that link.
[10:14:29] <BillCriswell> I don't want to kill the search, kind of just want it a little smarter about what I type.
[10:22:28] <blakespot> so
[10:23:08] <blakespot> Does anyone have an iPad or iPhone handy? I am trying to figure out why a jquery event trigger to reveal a div on touchstart is triggering other items on the page...
[10:26:03] <BillCriswell> blakespot: You can try the Chrome emulation?
[10:28:31] <blakespot> BillCriswell: what's that?
[10:28:54] <duch_kazatel> chrome has mobile emulation built in
[10:34:31] <BillCriswell> blakespot: It's a little tricky to get to in my opinion. Open up the dev tools then hit "Esc" and a little pane with 4 tabs will open up. You want emulation.
[10:35:00] <BillCriswell> Or click the icon that looks like a >= thingie
[10:38:38] <blakespot> yes - I see it
[10:43:50] <BillCriswell> Just spend like 10 minutes on something and realized I spelled "entries" wrong.
[10:44:17] <BillCriswell> Not sure if being able to auto correct words in our brains is a good thing for programmers.
[10:44:59] <decx> that's why declared vars have a different color
[10:45:04] <FernandoBasso> I have some message divs that are sometimes inserted dynamically in the DOM. I have a function that detects a click on that those divs and remove them. For that I use $('body').on('click', '.msg-div', ...). How about making something similar that makes the div go away in 10 seconds?
[10:45:46] <decx> setTimeout
[10:45:53] <FernandoBasso> I know how to do that with already existing dom objects, but I'm lost in this situation.
[10:46:28] <duch_kazatel> run the setTimeout setup in a callack for the thing that inserts the div.
[10:46:32] <converge> can I get what is inside of the <b> ? like here <b class="total">hello</b>
[10:46:41] <duch_kazatel> converge sure, .text()
[10:46:51] <duch_kazatel> FernandoBasso there's no elegant way to detect if something was added to the page.
[10:46:53] <FernandoBasso> duch_kazatel: I did that. I was hoping for something like I did for the click.
[10:47:00] <converge> duch_kazatel: thanks!!
[10:48:57] <FernandoBasso> decx, duch_kazatel: Thanks.
[10:49:37] <BillCriswell> decx: This "templating" language isn't too friendly in that case haha.
[10:53:07] <decx> smarty?
[10:55:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Twig.
[10:55:53] <BillCriswell> I'm doing things in a template I never thought I'd have to do.
[10:56:11] <BillCriswell> I don't feel like it's too terrible, but it doesn't feel exactly right.
[10:56:19] <ringing> hey what are some ways i can find any errors on my site? i've checked firebugs debugger and it isn't displaying anything which must be wrong since i know i have some errors
[10:56:35] <BillCriswell> decx: http://pastie.org/pastes/9429813/text
[10:57:34] <duch_kazatel> ringing how do you know there are errors?
[10:57:55] <ringing> because i have a call to a js file which isnt there
[10:57:59] <ringing> duch_kazatel:
[10:57:59] <decx> ah for json. doesnt look so out of the ordinary then
[10:58:09] <duch_kazatel> ringing huh?  start over.
[10:59:18] <BillCriswell> It feels icky with that in a view though doesn't it?
[10:59:29] <BillCriswell> Maybe I'm just being picky.
[10:59:35] <ringing> duch_kazatel: i have a line that is like this
[10:59:36] <ringing> <script type="text/javascript" src="_libraries/js/scrollbar/mCustomScrollbar.js"></script>
[10:59:42] <ringing> but that js file doesnt exist
[10:59:53] <decx> you are
[11:00:13] <duch_kazatel> ringing okay.  that wouldn't be a JS error, that's a network error.
[11:01:39] <BillCriswell> decx: Deal.
[11:01:49] <frank_o> Hi. What'd I miss?
[11:02:06] <duch_kazatel> nothing really
[11:02:34] <frank_o> Fine

[11:08:32] <duch_kazatel> the network tab
[11:08:51] <duch_kazatel> look for 404s
[11:09:15] <BillCriswell> Also, make sure in the console you're not filtering out all the errors haha
[11:09:34] <BillCriswell> Click that little funnel icon and play with things.

[11:24:21] <nicolas_leonidas> I'm having difficulties with running a datatables example that works with array of objects, any help is highly appreciated           <th>Name</th>
[11:24:28] <nicolas_leonidas> http://jsfiddle.net/6b74w/327/
[11:24:34] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric within your function you need to reference $(this)
[11:24:37] <duch_kazatel> that'
[11:24:43] <duch_kazatel> *that'll be the clicked element
[11:25:08] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: -> http://pastie.org/private/5p59hct7bcerjbwi5kag
[11:25:38] <frank_o> Es0teric: use jsfiddle like nicolas_leonidas
[11:25:54] <Es0teric> frank_o: so you cant read that?
[11:25:58] <Es0teric> its literally a function
[11:26:01] <frank_o> Es0teric: i cant run it
[11:26:02] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric show us that it's broken.
[11:26:14] <Es0teric> its not broken.. it works fine it just doesnt do what i want it do
[11:26:16] <Es0teric> *to

[11:26:58] <frank_o> Please see http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ on why fiddles "are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."
[11:26:58] <duch_kazatel> for somebody who does mostly backend stuff, you're sure in here a lot ;)
[11:27:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yeah because i dont work with javascript a lot
[11:27:24] <duch_kazatel> but you do work with it a lot.

[11:28:32] <frank_o> Es0teric: you can at runnable.com
[11:28:48] <duch_kazatel> but his issue isn't php, it's html and javascript.  reduce the problem down to those.
[11:29:08] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i was just wondering because i can just generate list items with php
[11:29:37] <duch_kazatel> or you can type a few out.  or you can copy them from the rendered page.

[11:42:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric $('.item-container') is "get me all elements with this class"
[11:42:35] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric $(this).find('.item-container') is "get me all elements with this class that are descendents of the current element"
[11:42:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i get that
[11:42:47] <duch_kazatel> you're using that same syntax one line up.
[11:42:54] <dmsuperman> I like $('.item-container', this) is there a practical difference between the two?
[11:43:11] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman that uses .find() under the hood
[11:43:22] <dmsuperman> or just syntactical sugar
[11:43:25] <dmsuperman> k
[11:43:39] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i still dont get where you mean use this in which context
[11:43:48] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric huh?
[11:43:59] <duch_kazatel> you need the current clicked thing - "this" refers to that thing.
[11:44:06] <dmsuperman> Es0teric: Right now you are finding every single .item-container on the page
[11:44:13] <Es0teric> dmsuperman: yes i can see that
[11:44:22] <dmsuperman> So you need to supply a context to that selector
[11:44:42] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you want all .item-container that are children of whatever was clicked. $(this) is the thing that was clicked.
[11:45:16] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ok now i get it
[11:45:42] <duch_kazatel> might be good for you to run through learn.jquery.com since you're in here asking the same kinds of questions pretty frequently.
[11:47:14] <paulvd> I am getting an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined" on this line of code http://pastebin.com/gHDZ7XgV How can I fix it ?
[11:47:45] <duch_kazatel> paulvd what is selector set to?
[11:47:59] <duch_kazatel> that usually means your selector isn't actually working.
[11:48:25] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: how would i change the caret on second click which fades .item-container out?
[11:48:31] <decx> animate scrollTop :(
[11:48:35] <paulvd> um
[11:48:45] <Es0teric> doing $(‘.item-container:hidden’) is not really doing it
[11:49:14] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric i'd add a class or data attribute that stores some kind of state and run an if off of that.
[11:49:28] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: like data-id?
[11:49:47] <duch_kazatel> if ($thisThing.hasClass('expanded')) { /* do logic to close */ }
[11:50:10] <paulvd> thats something i cant figure out
[11:50:12] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: why would i do that? i already have fadeToggle working
[11:50:26] <Es0teric> i am trying to detect if its display: none
[11:50:27] <paulvd> is a wordpress plugin
[11:50:43] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric because you're relying on ephemeral, inherent data for state.
[11:50:47] <duch_kazatel> that's fragile.
[11:51:12] <duch_kazatel> be explicit, rather than implicit.
[11:52:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: again.. i already have it working off of fadeToggle
[11:52:45] <Es0teric> i am not trying to do more work than i should
[11:53:07] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric: again.. be explicit rather than implicit.  otherwise you're going to wind up with bug-addled code later that relies on unreliable info for state.
[11:53:13] <duch_kazatel> you're already seeing the side-effects of that.
[11:53:29] <duch_kazatel> if you don't want to take my advice, that's fine ;)
[12:02:55] <Blaster> duch_kazatel, in follow up to our chat yesterday, I'm still getting a reference to a stale element when I try to do my focus() call.  http://jsfiddle.net/bJ5mu/
[12:03:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:03:12] <duch_kazatel> follow up whatnow?
[12:03:19] <Blaster> You helped me out yesterday remember?
[12:03:22] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:03:23] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:03:27] <Blaster> I was firing events inside events.
[12:03:31] <Blaster> You helped me condense it.
[12:03:32] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[12:03:46] <Blaster> But basically, I'm trying to focus() on the element that reloaded the form over AJAX after it's reloaded.
[12:04:03] <Blaster> But the element referenced in $(this) is stale.
[12:04:30] <duch_kazatel> okay.  are you reloading the dropdown as well?
[12:04:33] <Blaster> Yeah.
[12:05:00] <duch_kazatel> then store the value and set the option to that value after the magic has been run.
[12:05:36] <Blaster> Why is that better?
[12:05:44] <Blaster> I just want to focus the element, it would already be set to the proper value.
[12:06:28] <owen1> what does .find('.description, dl dd') mean? and where is it documented?
[12:07:41] <Blaster> It means search through the children and find the first .description or <dd> element inside of a <dl> element.
[12:08:05] <Blaster> owen1, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors

[12:34:57] <jeykook> why is the "Loading" message of my spinner taking the css color i set in the success part of my ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/L4weK/1/
[12:36:00] <antlong> you probably want to specify text color
[12:36:17] <antlong> line 23 is causing it though
[12:36:42] <BillCriswell> jeykook: Does the error have it's own html with inline styles?
[12:36:43] <antlong> actually that could be wrong, what color is the message
[12:37:14] <uskerine> hi, I am trying to load segments of HTML code by doing: $(function(){        $('#sidebar').load("sidebar.html");    });
[12:37:32] <jeykook> BillCriswell:  error is inside <p><small></small></p>
[12:37:54] <BillCriswell> jeykook: Do you have p or small with { color: #somecolor; } in your css?
[12:38:14] <jeykook> BillCriswell:  im just adding the color in the ajax funct
[12:38:21] <uskerine> so HTML blocks of code can be reused. However, while loading blocks by that, how could I later activate a class? $(document).ready does no longer work in that scenario
[12:38:32] <jeykook> BillCriswell:  to the entire div
[12:38:54] <BillCriswell> jeykook: I htink I'd need to see it in action.
[12:40:15] <BillCriswell> uskerine: var template = '<div>Recycle</div'; var $el = $(template).addClass('foo'); would end up with <div class="foo">Recycle</div>.
[12:45:06] <uskerine> BillCriswell not sure if that fits in this case
[12:45:13] <uskerine> what I want to do is, within my HTML code do:
[12:45:22] <uskerine> <div id="reusableBlock"></div>
[12:45:29] <hlvwrk> >:
[12:45:31] <uskerine> and then load a .html in that div
[12:45:38] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[12:45:42] <uskerine> but once loaded, I want to add a class to an item within that div
[12:45:56] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You shouldn't be cloning that because it has an id.
[12:46:16] <uskerine> I am not cloning, I am reusing html code across many html files
[12:46:26] <uskerine> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8988855/include-another-html-file-in-a-html-file
[12:46:38] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[12:46:39] <uskerine> but then I find that $(document).ready() does not count for this embbeded code
[12:47:18] <uskerine> so I can't add a class to an item by doing just .addClass inside $(document).ready(... as it would be normally be done
[12:47:22] <uskerine> any idea is really welcomed
[12:47:33] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I'm really confused by your goal.
[12:47:48] <uskerine> my goal is: I have 10 files with the same menu
[12:47:56] <uskerine> and I am tired of doing copy&paste
[12:47:59] <uskerine> I want to centralize the menu
[12:48:09] <uskerine> which is always the same, except for which item has class "active"
[12:48:22] <BillCriswell> $('<div id="resuableBlock"></div>').load('/nav.html', function () { $(this).find('.somethingInNavHTML').addClass('neat'); });
[12:48:27] <BillCriswell> I think you're looking for something like that.
[12:48:36] <uskerine> Yeah! I think so
[12:48:39] <uskerine> thanks let me try it
[12:48:44] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You don't have the ability to just include the file?
[12:49:04] <uskerine> no I don't, I am using plain html
[12:49:12] <uskerine> I don't want to move into JSP just for reusing code
[12:49:39] <uskerine> if there is another way, please let me know
[12:49:42] <BillCriswell> uskerine: There are other options for you besides JSP, but if this works for you go for it.
[12:49:52] <uskerine> any idea or tip is welcomed
[12:50:19] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You can look into static site generators or many other tools out there.
[12:50:24] <BillCriswell> uskerine: What kind of site are you building?
[12:51:05] <uskerine> web app
[12:51:06] <uskerine> java
[12:51:18] <uskerine> but the front end uses just html and AJAX
[12:52:05] <uskerine> (and CSS and bootstrap and a lot of plugins, of coursE)
[12:52:11] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[12:53:36] <BillCriswell> If you don't mind spending a few bucks mixture.io is really nice and easy to use.
[12:54:28] <BillCriswell> If you're comfortable on the command line there's http://jekyllrb.com/
[12:55:07] <uskerine> for the next one I definitvely have to look for some kind of extra support
[12:55:14] <uskerine> I am doing a lot of copy&paste
[12:55:30] <BillCriswell> Yeah, shouldn't have to do that.
[12:55:49] <BillCriswell> {% include "menu" %} should be all you have to do.
[12:56:02] <uskerine> jekyll is something similar to less.js  for css I guess
[12:56:11] <uskerine> yeah something like that would be really helpful
[12:56:22] <uskerine> you can do it with JSP, but then you are unnecesarily overloading the server
[12:56:37] <uskerine> as JSP are turned into servlets, even if they do not a have a single line of JAVA
[12:56:53] <BillCriswell> uskerine: jekyll does a lot more than that.
[12:59:14] <uskerine> I will check it, for the moment (I am almost done with the app) I will continue without introducing anything new
[12:59:20] <jwmann> Is there a way to calculate the outerHeight() of an element an ignore the current inline height style?
[12:59:21] <uskerine> btw, your solution works
[12:59:24] <uskerine> thanks!
[13:00:05] <jwmann> I'm essentially trying to calculate the outer height of an element on the inital page load (before jQuery modifies it)
[13:01:28] <jeykook> BillCriswell:  i have tried changing to this http://jsfiddle.net/L4weK/2/
[13:03:12] <BillCriswell> uskerine: No problem.
[13:04:13] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Why not get the height before jQuery modifies it?
[13:04:58] <BillCriswell> jeykook: This isn't really helping me figure out the color situation.
[13:08:53] <jwmann> BillCriswell: I doing this through a function that's called many times. The way I have it now is I'm passing the outerHeight into the function on page load however all the other elements are set inside the function. It's more of a semantic thing than anything.
[13:10:40] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Not sure I'm following right, not really a good follower in general haha. Do you have a demo?
[13:13:19] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Not sure if I'd be able to make a demo but here is the code. - http://d.pr/n/FGmb/3ALO5Okt
[13:14:02] <jwmann> BillCriswell: I'm essentially trying to make 1 element sticky to the bottom of the page by modifying the height of 'dynamicElement' (the element above it)
[13:14:40] <jwmann> I'd only want that the element to be sticky if height of the browser has enough room.
[13:15:49] <BillCriswell> jwmann: How about @media ( min-height: 400px ) { .sticky-element { position: fixed; bottom: 0; } } ?
[13:16:14] <jwmann> Without 'jumping' (the height of the element above the sticky element goes from e.g.: 540 => 500
[13:17:23] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Doing this way allows the user to scroll down and the sticky element is a static element functions as a regular page
[13:17:34] <Es0teric> ok so i want to be able to click on the “edit” button without the event doing a toggle http://jsfiddle.net/sxvL4/6/
[13:18:03] <jwmann> The sticky element is only sticky on page load essentially
[13:19:49] <BillCriswell> jwmann: I'm sorry something seems weird.
[13:21:30] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Here's an example of one without a sticky element (aka height of the Hero = Height of Navigation - Height of Window ) http://iloctech.com/
[13:22:22] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Mine is the same thing except I'm doing Height of Hero = Height of Navigation + Height of Sticky Element on the bottom - Height of Window
[13:23:02] <BillCriswell> jwmann: I'm actually more confused now.
[13:23:06] <Es0teric> anyone?
[13:23:26] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Rofl, Perhaps I should've mentioned. Trying Resizing the window. :)
[13:24:07] <BillCriswell> Ok, to what size and what should I see?
[13:24:08] <jwmann> The function is called to adjust this ratio as you resize as well as on page load
[13:24:24] <drej> Jew Man™ - saving bagels for the greater good
[13:24:32] <drej> sorry :(
[13:25:27] <BillCriswell> Christ, drupal.
[13:25:55] <jwmann> BillCriswell: You can start at the smallest size your browser can do (height and width-wise) and then resize with your mouse to any size larger. You should see the Hero height follow the height of your browser
[13:25:55] <BillCriswell> jwmann: The ratio of what?
[13:26:21] <jwmann> (By Hero I'm talking about the banner / header)
[13:26:45] <BillCriswell> jwmann: I'm not seeing anything resize besides the kids picture.
[13:27:01] <jwmann> BillCriswell: That's exactly what I'm talking about. The picture :)
[13:27:38] <jwmann> The specific element that is being resize is #page-header on that page.
[13:27:41] <Es0teric> see the main problem i am having is that on $(‘.editItem’) click, i am trying to unbind the #blockSortable li but it disables it for all of the other li's
[13:28:00] <BillCriswell> jwmann: It looks like they're just using background-size: cover for that.
[13:28:13] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric lol had you taken my advice...
[13:28:31] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: advice on… visibility?
[13:28:44] <duch_kazatel> advice on architecture.
[13:28:57] <jwmann> BillCriswell: For that part, yes. The height of that element is dependant on the browser viewport/window size.
[13:29:03] <Es0teric> dude, duch_kazatel this is a wordpress site i am working on
[13:29:17] <Es0teric> so its very different
[13:29:19] <BillCriswell> jwmann: It looks like it just bumps up the height depending on the width of the browser.
[13:30:09] <jwmann> BillCriswell: That's technically what background-size: cover; is doing. The height of the element is applied through jQuery
[13:31:05] <jwmann> BillCriswell: If this were done with height: 100%; and without jQuery, then reizing the window wouldn't alter the inital height of the element. (non-responsive)
[13:32:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric not really.  one sec and i'll show you.
[13:33:54] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Perhaps I can explain it like this. On inital page load let's say the browser window's height is: 1000px, and the navigation is 200px in height. If we wanted to (through javascript) have that element fit the rest of the screen, we'd have to make that element 800px in height.
[13:34:16] <Es0teric> ok duch_kazatel
[13:34:46] <jwmann> Now this calculation can be done multiple times and trigger based on if the window is resized or not.
[13:35:02] <jwmann> Hence the function.
[13:35:46] <xxx1337> Hey, I want to improve on my writing of jquery and JS. Does any of this Jquery/JS I wrote make you guys cringe? If please let me know: http://jsfiddle.net/bzy4K/
[13:36:20] <jwmann> So now if we have 3 elements and the window size is 1000px in height and the navigation is 200px and the part we want to be sticky at the bottom is 200px in height. Then we'd have to make the middle part 600px in height.
[13:36:27] <jwmann> That's the ratio I'm referring to.
[13:37:11] <duch_kazatel> xxx1337 it makes me cringe a little when people say they "write jquery" ;)
[13:39:25] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/sxvL4/8/
[13:39:28] <duch_kazatel> something like this.
[13:40:16] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: that is a lot of js man...
[13:40:44] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that's not very much at all.  this will be much more maintainable down the road.
[13:41:12] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: so then stopImmediatePropagation() stops it from executing the event again unless a li is clickeD?
[13:41:20] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric no.
[13:41:31] <duch_kazatel> stopImmediatePropagation() stops the event from propagating.
[13:41:44] <duch_kazatel> events bubble up through the document and can trigger handlers bound to parent elements.
[13:41:48] <duch_kazatel> that's what you were experiencing before.
[13:42:07] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ah i see
[13:42:44] <decx> just dont put your handler on the li if you dont want to go on a propagationhike
[13:43:01] <duch_kazatel> xxx1337 some general feedback: if you have jquery available, don't be afraid to use it instead of document.getElementById(), etc.  always use === instead of ==.  use more descriptive variable names.
[13:43:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: oh i see now
[13:43:37] <Es0teric> you are hard coding the status using the data method
[13:43:53] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric correct.  explicit rather than implicit.
[13:45:54] <BillCriswell> jwmann: I'm just having a hard time following what/why/how this thing is working.
[13:48:01] <jwmann> BillCriswell: A function is called on page-load and when the window is resized. To put it simply this function take 1 element on the page and matches it's height with the height of the browser.
[13:48:05] <decx> duch_kazatel still a lot of stuff there
[13:48:25] <duch_kazatel> decx i'm really not a fan of implicit state personally.
[13:48:30] <decx> why not fadetoggle and currennstatus as a bool
[13:48:31] <duch_kazatel> i've been bitten by it too many times.
[13:48:46] <jwmann> BillCriswell: This ensures this element is always fullscreen regardless of the height of the browser.
[13:48:53] <xxx1337> duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:48:56] <decx> like http://jsfiddle.net/decx/sxvL4/9/
[13:49:22] <BillCriswell> jwmann: On the one you sent me if I make my browser window tall it doesn't fill it.
[13:50:34] <duch_kazatel> decx great - now I want to mark one as active by default - http://jsfiddle.net/sxvL4/11/

[13:50:50] <Es0teric> alright duch_kazatel that actually does make a lot more sense =_=
[13:50:58] <Es0teric> i just didnt know about .data
[13:51:17] <decx> hehe aaaw that's too bad ^^
[13:51:39] <duch_kazatel> this is why I prefer the explicit state instead.  i don't care how you convey it.  you could use .data() or classes, but down the road when you want to add/remove stuff, change functionality, whatever, you're going to have an easier time.
[13:54:02] <BillCriswell> jwmann: I only get the height to match in weird situations.
[13:54:19] <spookah> does anyone know how to change the header color of the active accordion?
[13:54:29] * spookah has been trying (and googling) with no luck =[
[13:54:45] <decx> inspect element, find class name apply css directly to the forehead
[13:55:04] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Hmm, oh well. Theoretically, it should always match the height of your browser (be fullscreen) unless your browser window's height is less than "The breakpoint"
[13:56:45] <decx> duch_kazatel i found a perfect excuse, my active class would be on the li and change the h3:after to the right icon instead fontawesomes inflexible stuff ;) *hides*
[13:56:56] <duch_kazatel> decx hahahaha
[13:57:03] <jwmann> BillCriswell: The Breakpoint is the height of all the elements that you want to appear on the fullscreen as they load initally. Element X, Y, Z has the accumulative height of 1200px, the breakpoint is 1200px. If your window's height is only 800px in height, then the function shouldn't trigger.
[13:57:48] <jwmann> However, if the height of your browser reaches above that height, the function triggers.
[13:58:21] <jwmann> This ensures that the sticky element only is sticky from browser windows with the size to spare.
[14:00:44] <BillCriswell> What's sticky though?
[14:02:20] <lombrozo> Can anyone tell me why my jQuery(document).ready(function() {do_positioning();}); isn't hit at http://www.ealteaching.com
[14:02:37] <phoenixsun> Is there is way of retrieving the Title of the Youtube video currently playing when the feed is a youtube playlist?
[14:07:19] <Es0teric> when looking for events on specific elements… can you add an array of elements?
[14:07:25] <jwmann> BillCriswell: I think I just figured out my problem. :P I was grabbing the outerHeight of the elements too early, I needed to change (document).ready to (window).load
[14:07:48] <Es0teric> like $([‘.class1’, ‘.class2’, ‘.class3’]).on(‘hover’, function() {})
[14:08:36] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: $('.class1, .class2')
[14:08:41] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: ah
[14:08:50] <BillCriswell> jwmann: That's good. I'm still a bit lost on the whole thing haha.
[14:09:13] <BillCriswell> jwmann: http://jsbin.com/segekega/1/edit I cam eup with this... wasn't sure if that's what you wanted and came up with this as well http://jsbin.com/tidomoko/1/edit
[14:09:41] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Hahahah, well, once I push this change, I will show you the end result. :P
[14:10:44] <BillCriswell> I'm actually about the run. I'll check back at the logs though. Take care.
[14:11:28] <frank_o> Once I push this change, the world will be mine :P
[14:13:17] <eddiev89> I am wondering why my ajax functions get stucked when my page gets inactive for a certain time. Everything works fine when i reload the page.
[14:13:26] <duch_kazatel> "get stucked"?
[14:13:48] <eddiev89> yeah its like que spinner keeps loading
[14:13:53] <eddiev89> and loading
[14:17:34] <eddiev89> its like every ajax action get stuck after a few minutes of page inactivity
[14:17:51] <duch_kazatel> any network errors or console errors?
[14:20:28] <eddiev89> duch_kazatel: 505 error
[14:21:06] <duch_kazatel> you sure that's not a 504?
[14:21:35] <eddiev89> duch_kazatel:  yes sorry is 504
[14:22:02] <duch_kazatel> that's a gateway timeout.
[14:22:29] <eddiev89> duch_kazatel:  how can i fix that
[14:22:39] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[14:22:50] <duch_kazatel> that's a session thing iirc, not a javascript thing.
[14:23:30] <winterpk> I'm gettting an error with tinymce and I've narrowed it down to the "link" plugin. Here is the error, TypeError: r is null.  Does anyone know what could cause this?
[14:39:40] <winterpk> It appears that my error is because the element I'm trying to init tinymce on is added via ajax. I'm using setInterval and checking for is(':visible') on the target element. Still the problem remains though. Anyone have any suggestions? It works if I set the interval to 5 seconds.
[14:42:57] <duch_kazatel> winterpk init in the .done() callback of the ajax call.
[14:48:10] <winterpk> I don't have access to the xhr request in my script. (using the new media uploader in wordpress)
[14:55:53] <Horacsio> hi again :D
[14:57:27] <Horacsio> so I have $('.section’).find('.titulo2').delay(300).animate({opacity:1}, 1500); and I need to find othe 2 classes where I need diferent delays: .find('.subtitulo2').delay(500).animate({opacity:1}, 1500); .find('.texto2').delay(700).animate({opacity:1}, 1500);
[14:57:28] <Horacsio> How do I do this?
[14:59:45] <Horacsio> I mean: is there a cleaner way to write this: http://jsfiddle.net/wgDnh/
[14:59:50] <duch_kazatel> winterpk you can setup an event handler for ajax event then.
[15:10:02] <mortal1> if i wanted to find an element matching certain text, and then find a checkbox in a neighboring td, and set it to checked
[15:10:09] <mortal1> how would one do so?
[15:10:40] <mortal1> $('td:contains("searchText")')[0]
[15:10:52] <mortal1> .. then some sort of prev selection right?
[15:12:38] <mortal1> $(e).prev(':input') doesn't give me anything :^('
[15:12:52] <Horacsio> how to clean this: http://jsfiddle.net/wgDnh/
[15:13:42] <mortal1> suppose I'll just have to use find
[15:13:50] <duch_kazatel> mortal1 can you create a paste?
[15:13:56] <duch_kazatel> using jsfiddle or something similar?

[15:31:57] <srji> http://tinyurl.com/o9qodxa how is it possible to use the addClass from jquery-ui.effect?
[15:50:07] <Sal> hi
[15:50:51] <Sal> i have a small div that is bottom: -60px. I want to animate it to go to bottom: 16px and then back to -60px
[15:51:19] <Sal> i'm doing this: .animate({bottom: "16px"}, 100); and .animate({bottom: "-60px"}, 100);
[15:51:33] <Sal> it comes up, but it doesn't return to -60
[15:51:38] <Sal> what am i doing wrong?
[15:51:51] <duch_kazatel> you're doing both at the same tiume.
[15:52:01] <Sal> no, i have them in an if
[15:52:15] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Sal
[15:52:15] <b-ot> Sal: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:52:44] <Sal> ok
[16:27:09] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[17:07:12] <duch_kazatel> i think this is the quietest this place ahs ever been
[17:09:40] <decx> shit you might have to do some work
[17:09:57] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:10:08] <duch_kazatel> i always actually get stuff done.
[17:10:20] <decx> OR ... jump around, edit a level and explode http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7V5xJ/show/
[17:11:50] <duch_kazatel> woah
[17:12:15] <decx> finally a use for resizable
[17:13:23] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[17:13:42] <duch_kazatel> that's a surprisingly small amount of js
[17:15:33] <decx> the level elements being controlled by html and css takes away much of the pain
[17:15:51] <decx> like having to create a shadow canvas to minimize redraws
[17:16:16] <decx> basic physics and collision isnt that much
[17:16:25] <decx> and for the editor is all draggable and resizable
[17:16:28] <decx> it's
[17:55:43] <hooligan123> how can i run $each backwards again?
[17:55:52] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[17:57:19] <hooligan123> the html output is going the opposite way to what i desire
[17:58:04] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394020/jquery-each-backwards
[17:59:00] <hooligan123> ah cool
[17:59:11] <hooligan123> so simple as well gd bless jquery
[18:08:59] <decx> how is that simpler than while(lengthvar--){ }
[18:09:26] <decx> oh snap, it's too late
[18:09:30] <decx> nitenite
[18:11:41] <BillCriswell> decx: How much work did you get done today?
[18:11:56] <hooligan123> ok so how do I use reverse with $.each I am doing $.each inside a $.getJSON... i made jquery a reverse function: jQuery.fn.reverse = [].reverse;
[18:12:24] <BillCriswell> hooligan123: What are you trying to reverse?
[18:12:29] <BillCriswell> A collection of elements?
[18:12:35] <hooligan123> the results from $jetJSON
[18:12:59] <hooligan123> not its json objects
[18:13:00] <BillCriswell> jetJSON? Sounds fast.
[18:13:08] <BillCriswell> Just kidding I'm hilarious.
[18:13:11] <hooligan123> hah
[18:13:22] <BillCriswell> With a regular array just doing .reverse() would be plenty.
[18:14:03] <BillCriswell> $.each( items.reverse(), function( index, value ) { });
[18:15:49] <BillCriswell> hooligan123: The jQuery.fn.reverse = [].reverse would be be useful on a jQuery object.
[18:17:35] <hooligan123> yeah but it wont work when i do $.each(json.reverse()...) is complains that undefined is not a function .. should i put the reverse function at the begining of the script
[18:19:26] <BillCriswell> hooligan123: What is json exactly?
[18:19:45] <hooligan123> ah that was it
[18:19:52] <BillCriswell> hooligan123: Sweet.
[18:20:01] <hooligan123> the reverse functions needs to be be at the top of the script
[18:20:04] <hooligan123> der ;)
[18:21:08] <BillCriswell> It shouldn't matter... but I'm not looking at your code so I don't know what you're doing in the mean time haha
[18:22:02] <chriys> hi all
[18:22:11] <BillCriswell> chriys: Ayyyy
[18:22:29] <chriys> how you doing
[18:22:56] <BillCriswell> Breaking things, helping people.
[18:22:57] <BillCriswell> You?
[18:26:56] <yanger> $('#ThisID').attr('disabled','disabled'); = <input id="ThisID" disabled="disabled"/> or something like that, right?
[18:27:08] <yanger> how do i undo it? i tried RemoveAttr but doesn't seem to work.
[18:27:32] <BillCriswell> yanger: $('#id').prop('disabled', false);
[18:27:40] <BillCriswell> and true to set it to disabled.
[18:27:43] <yanger> .prop is prefered?
[18:27:45] <BillCriswell> (is the proper way)
[18:27:48] <BillCriswell> yanger: Yes.
[18:27:54] <yanger> gotcha. makes better sense
[18:28:41] <BillCriswell> yanger: Yeah, prop vs attr still gets me tripped up even though I think I get it.
[18:29:30] <yanger> what's the method to mimic the reset button in a form?
[18:29:43] <yanger> sorry, two that bugged me for 30 minutes ;\
[18:30:25] <yanger> .trigger('reset');
[18:30:28] <yanger> google always helps
[18:30:34] <yanger> with the right words :P
[18:30:37] <yanger> thanks
[18:30:56] <hooligan123> hm no that is failure the strange thing is that other people say that $.each(json.reverse(),......) should work i think the problem is that json is [object object] so it might not have .reverse on the top level object .. i duno i might be smoking crack but .prepending is another way to solve this instead of .appending
[18:35:01] <BillCriswell> yanger: I wouldn't have had to look that up. Never tried it haha
[18:39:01] <Xoro> http://jsfiddle.net/WPaqm/ Can someone help me with this? I want it to clear the default value of an <input> with text after the first click but not the consequetive ones.
[18:40:16] <Zak> is there a way to ensure that you've binded a handler as the first handler to an element?
[18:41:37] <BillCriswell>  Xoro: Can you ask that differently? Not following.
[18:42:21] <Xoro> So there's a text field with a value="" property, all I want is the first button clicked, no matter which to clear it and then add it's string.
[18:42:41] <Xoro> But when I click the next button / number it shouldn't clear it again.
[18:44:28] <BillCriswell> Xoro: so just don't add the value to the field when it's clicked first?
[18:45:41] <Xoro> No, it should clear the value it has from the markup and then add the string from it's click function. If I were to press 1 from the start it should just show 1, if I clicked 2 after it should show 12.
[18:46:28] <Xoro> As it stands it's Wired Address12. My if function doesn't work, because I suck at this.
[18:49:24] <BillCriswell> My internet is being so shitty.
[18:49:38] <Xoro> I think it's jsfiddle. I got 500 errors on it too.
[18:49:43] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/WPaqm/1/ I think this is what you're looking for, it's taking forever to load though.
[18:52:13] <Xoro> That seems to work alright. There was no mapping for the clear button though. It's fine if I add it.
[18:52:24] <Xoro> Thanks BillCriswell.
[18:52:47] <BillCriswell> Xoro: Yeah I forgot about that. Should be easy to adjust though.
[18:57:06] <BillCriswell> Xoro: http://jsfiddle.net/WPaqm/4/ works.
[18:57:53] <Xoro> So it does. Thanks again.
[18:58:54] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:59:52] <ISmithers> Hey all, I have WAMP setup and am testing a local site which reads in some json data from disk. So I've set up the appropriate htaccess rights and can load the initial data no worries. But a second set of data (in the same directory) reports 403 Forbidden.
[19:00:19] <ISmithers> What might be causing that?
[19:01:19] <BillCriswell> Xoro: Also... you probbably just want the placeholder attribute now that I think about it?
[19:01:28] <BillCriswell> Should have caught that like 10 minutes ago.
[19:01:29] <Xoro> Uhhh
[19:01:58] <Xoro> Like, when the user presses clear it should return to default? That would be prefferable.
[19:02:17] <Xoro> I was just going for clear because it was easiest for me to imagine coding.
[19:03:26] <BillCriswell> Xoro: http://jsfiddle.net/WPaqm/6/
[19:03:53] <BillCriswell> Man, jfiddle is taking a dump or something.
[19:04:05] <Xoro> Yeah. You're having a ball with this man.
[19:04:50] <BillCriswell> Always!
[19:12:27] <Xoro> Heh, when the user presses back the input isn't sanitized.
[19:41:53] <yanger> function clearfield(y){	$('input#'+y).val() = "";} ... <input id="this" value="blah" onclick="clearfield('blah');"/>
[19:42:02] <yanger> why doesn't that work?
[19:42:17] <AcidRain> i have a div id #gamedata, inside of it is a tag <p> how do i replace the content of <p> without replacing the <p> tag
[19:42:33] <AcidRain> $('#gamedata').fadeOut().load('jk.php').fadeIn("slow");  currently this
[19:43:50] <yanger> er. clearfield('this') i ment
[19:44:16] <BillCriswell> yanger: You probbably want to do .val('')
[19:44:49] <BillCriswell> If you're passing 'this' like that it would look for an input with an id of "this".
[19:44:56] <yanger> ohh
[19:45:07] <BillCriswell> yanger:
[19:45:13] <yanger> odd.. why would adding the '' make it work? cool
[19:45:24] <BillCriswell> You don't want the = '';
[19:45:37] <yanger> i mean .val('')
[19:45:38] <BillCriswell> Just $('#' + y).val('') would do the trick.
[19:45:48] <yanger> ohh i see
[19:45:55] <BillCriswell> No reason to do the input before it since ids are unique.
[19:46:23] <yanger> that also makes sense. i haven't jqueried for a while.. :P thanks
[19:46:34] <AcidRain> perhaps my question is wrong. how do i reload the #gamedata id and make the <p> tag obey by the css?
[19:46:39] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:47:04] <BillCriswell> AcidRain: Target the p instead.
[19:47:24] <AcidRain> ye. how? #gamedata p     ?
[19:47:35] <BillCriswell> Yes, just like CSS.
[19:49:13] <BillCriswell> AcidRain: Issue with your code is that it'll fade out and fade in quite possibly before the content is loaded.
[19:50:34] <AcidRain> sry. i have a function timer set to 10seconds
[19:51:40] <BillCriswell> Just having that code in a timeout wouldn't prevent the issue I described.
[19:57:48] <Courtney> hi i am new to this and wanted to know if anyone could help me?
[19:58:37] <Courtney> I am using jquery and i have created one
[19:59:05] <Courtney> and I just want to know how to make a change to it, without having to create it all over again?
[20:01:42] <Courtney> is anyone here?.....
[20:19:37] <rahuldroy_work> hey guys, I am trying to do a live search implementation where I want to wait 500ms (no inputs) before a search query is done to reduce the load on the dataabse. I am struggling with the logic to carry this out. http://jsfiddle.net/dCF2z/
[20:20:12] <rahuldroy_work> the code runs each input made after 500 ms instead of running it once.
[20:28:37] <tandroid> rahuldroy_work: http://jsfiddle.net/dCF2z/1/
[20:28:59] <tandroid> you just needed an actual callback function.
[20:30:58] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: let me give that a shot
[20:34:28] <tandroid> rahuldroy_work: underscore.js has a handy method called debounce that is useful for this kind of thing http://underscorejs.org/#debounce
[20:37:41] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: never heard of underscore before
[20:37:47] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: let me give that a shot'
[20:38:52] <tandroid> rahuldroy_work, I like to use jquery for DOM manipulation and underscore for it's js helpers. They work quite well together really.
[20:47:45] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: how would I use debounce for this?
[20:47:54] <Guest34717> anyone knows why $('a', this).attr('id') doesn't return an ID but instead returns the class
[20:49:17] <dleynes661> Hola. Quick question. Trying to setup my wordpress site using HTTPS. Should image references inside the CSS file be in HTTPS as well?
[20:49:21] <rahuldroy_work> could it be because there can be multiple instances of 'a'??
[20:50:36] <arunbabu> Any pointers on how to find out a function called on form submit?
[20:51:10] <MichaelR> there are, but I thought the "This" took care of it
[20:52:10] <rahuldroy_work> MichaelR: I am not exactly sure about it but you might have to use .each()
[20:52:25] <rahuldroy_work> MichaelR: and then this will work
[20:52:44] <MichaelR> yeah I just thought that maybe this desn't actually know what I'm selecting
[20:55:24] <tandroid> Sorry rahuldroy_work, I got distracted. but you could do something like this with debounce http://jsfiddle.net/dCF2z/2/
[20:55:53] <MichaelR> rahuldroy thank you
[20:56:38] <tandroid> arunbabu: what is it you're trying to do exactly?
[20:57:00] <tandroid> arunbabu: find what javascript is fired when you submit the form?
[20:57:09] <arunbabu> tandroid: yeah
[20:57:15] <tandroid> I don't think you can
[20:57:34] <tandroid> I mean there is no easy way to back track it.
[20:58:09] <arunbabu> tandroid: I was in the middle of edit a form and suddenly internet was disconnected. Now the page is dead. I have lots of data filled in form. So it possible to submit a form programmatically thru js?  <form action="javascript:void(0);"> <input type="submit" id="saveList" value="Save List"> <a href="/lists/415115" id="cancelEditing">Cancel Editing</a> </form>
[20:58:15] <arunbabu> This is my exact problem
[20:58:19] <arunbabu> Any other solution?
[20:58:29] <arunbabu> tandroid: ^
[21:00:14] <tandroid> why can't you just click submit now?
[21:00:38] <tandroid> If the internet is back now...
[21:03:44] <tandroid> MichaelR: can you create an example?
[21:03:51] <tandroid> Or give a link to the site?
[21:04:17] <MichaelR> yeah I can though I solved that problem now I have another one :P
[21:04:40] <tandroid> Oh great :)
[21:06:21] <MichaelR> http://mrabinovsky.com/test/
[21:06:34] <MichaelR> you can use the arrow keys and enter to navigate the menus
[21:07:04] <MichaelR> back for some strange reason you can't use the back button yet...
[21:07:17] <MichaelR> well at least you can't use it by pressing enter
[21:08:41] <MichaelR> you can look at the log its supposed to print out the ID of whatever you pressed enter once selected but on the back button it gives undefined even though it has an ID
[21:17:00] <tandroid> MichaelR: to debug that I would start by hardcoding some values like menu_index
[21:17:32] <tandroid> just change eq(menu_index) to the hardcoded value you think it should be and check that against your current menu_index.
[21:17:50] <MichaelR> I see
[21:17:54] <MichaelR> give me a sec
[21:19:33] <MichaelR> same thing, still undefined even when Iset it to 6
[21:21:03] <MichaelR> funny it works when I set it to 5 :/
[21:23:25] <tandroid> So do you need to use menu_select instead?
[21:24:30] <MichaelR> when I set it to 5 everything works as a back button
[21:24:56] <MichaelR> also menu_index works for the three other selectors menu_select doesn't
[21:25:33] <MichaelR> you know what, now its acting as if there is no else if as if there is only an else at the end
[21:26:55] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: sorry for the late response, I was out for lunch
[21:27:05] <rahuldroy_work> tandroid: it works!!!!!!!!!!!
[21:27:13] <tandroid> rahuldroy_work: nice!
[21:27:13] <rahuldroy_work> you are too awesome
[21:27:24] <tandroid> Thanks!
[21:28:32] <tandroid> MichaelR, have you tried putting a console.log in the keypress event to see what the menu_index is at each menu item?
[21:28:58] <MichaelR> yeah I did and it says 6
[21:29:30] <tandroid> So, to me, it looks like the index gets off after you hit enter on the first "page"
[21:30:13] <tandroid> I go to services, hit enter, then go to "software install" hit enter there and I get a console message of "tutorials"
[21:30:30] <MichaelR> that isn't the only problem, when I hit any of the bottom 3 (not including back) it acts as if I"m hitting them on the first page.
[21:30:34] <MichaelR> yeah I just noticed that
[21:30:40] <MichaelR> so my selectors are never moving a page!
[21:31:01] <MichaelR> that explains so much
[21:31:51] <MichaelR> I think I understand whats going on now
[21:32:11] <MichaelR> I assumed there is only an index value to what is visible, but apperantly invisible things also have an index value.
[21:32:19] <MichaelR> thinking back on it, pretty stupid assumption.
[21:32:29] <tandroid> Yes
[21:32:43] <tandroid> Oh not yes to it being a stupid assumption :)
[21:32:52] <MichaelR> lol
[21:33:19] <tandroid> you don't always need an else statement by the way.
[21:33:26] <MichaelR> I wonder if just making it so when I press enter it adds 6 to the value would work
[21:33:47] <tandroid> Nah, that's sloppy.
[21:33:50] <MichaelR> I didn't have one before, I put one there when I was thinking it was using my last else if as an else
[21:34:52] <tandroid> Let me think about this for a second...
[21:37:27] <tandroid> MichaelR: So the indexes wouldn't add up if you weren't in the global scope selecting those anchor tags.
[21:37:55] <MichaelR> what do you mean?
[21:38:23] <tandroid> so if you did so $('#menu1").find("a").eq(index)
[21:38:59] <tandroid> lets say the index was 0, it would return the first a tag in menu1
[21:39:13] <MichaelR> yes
[21:40:11] <dleynes661> I have one insecure script on my site that uses https.... (http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js). Am I okay or should I be worried?
[21:42:51] <tandroid> MichaelR: Am I maybe not understanding what the current problem is?
[21:43:15] <MichaelR> no I think you are understanding it perfectly
[21:43:21] <tandroid> Okay.
[21:43:48] <tandroid> Have you ever used the jquery this?
[21:43:50] <tandroid> $(this)
[21:44:08] <MichaelR> Yes I have though unsuccessfully.
[21:45:04] <tandroid> There are definitely some places you could use it and I think the last keydown function is one of them.
[21:45:54] <tandroid> Although... maybe not
[21:46:32] <MichaelR> I will look into this (pun intended :)
[21:47:16] <MichaelR> but tomorrow, because unfortunately I have work in the  morning and I'll be hung if I sleep in.
[21:47:29] <tandroid> ha yeah me too.
[21:47:45] <MichaelR> Good night, and thank you for all the help.
[21:47:56] <tandroid> Night, no problem.
[21:48:05] <tandroid> Good luck on it!
[21:53:16] <Forbidd3n> How would I set an .on click event of a button with class from within ajax loaded content?
[21:56:23] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[21:56:47] <Uhkis> Forbidd3n: $('something-that-exists-before-ajax').on('click', '.ajaxclass', function() {});
[21:57:06] <Forbidd3n> missing .ajax-class
[21:57:25] <Forbidd3n> can I do $('body')?
[21:58:03] <Forbidd3n> yeah that works thanks Uhkis
[21:58:10] <Uhkis> better make a div for that
[22:00:42] <Courtney> hello
[22:00:52] <Courtney> is there anyone in here?
[22:00:53] <Forbidd3n> so wrap it in a div instead of body?
[22:00:58] <Forbidd3n> Courtney: yeah
[22:01:24] <Courtney> yey! Just a quick question
[22:01:47] <Courtney> i am using jquery user interface to create a jquery
[22:02:07] <Courtney> so i create it and then download it
[22:02:39] <Courtney> but the problem is when I want to make another change how do I put it back into jquery?
[22:03:07] <Forbidd3n> can you do a fiddle with an example of what you are referring to?
[22:03:47] <Courtney> http://jqueryui.com/
[22:03:52] <Courtney> i am on this site
[22:03:59] <Courtney> i build it through this
[22:04:02] <Courtney> then i download it
[22:04:20] <Forbidd3n> ok
[22:04:21] <Courtney> but say i then want to make a change to it, decide i don't like the colour
[22:04:22] <Forbidd3n> and...
[22:04:46] <Courtney> can I reupload it through this user interface again and make the change to the one thing, or do i HAVE TO GO AND RECREATE IT ALL AGAIN... :(
[22:04:56] <Courtney> oppps sorry for caps
[22:05:25] <Forbidd3n> you have to do it over again or do a string replace in the css code for the color
[22:06:00] <Courtney> mmmm I thought so....
[22:06:23] <Courtney> if i want to open to css code how do i do that?
[22:06:29] <Courtney> what do i open it with?
[22:06:51] <Courtney> i have espresso will that work? i don't know much about programming
[22:07:35] <Forbidd3n> notepad would work
[22:07:53] <Courtney> ohhhh ok that sounds good
[22:08:05] <Courtney> so i open the jquery in notepad
[22:08:17] <Courtney> and edit the css code within that?
[22:09:32] <Forbidd3n> find replace the color you want to switch out
[22:10:17] <Courtney> cool so if i want to change the radius of the round cornering on my buttons same thing yeah?
[22:14:30] <star18bi_> I have  $(currentfield).closest('form').find('table > tbody > tr').addClass('ui-selected'); How can i apply this to  data-key=IRkeys
[22:15:16] <Uhkis> ?api data
[22:15:16] <b-ot> Uhkis: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[22:15:42] <star18bi_> I have  $(currentfield).closest('form').find('table > tbody > tr').addClass('ui-selected'); How can i apply this to  data-key=IRkeys within that tr
[22:24:52] <nascro> Hello from Southern California :) I'm working on an accordion menu. Is it possible to fix the height of a menu and "force" a scrollbar in the submenu? For context, see the right-side accordion menu here: http://nathanroberts.com/misc/map/
[22:30:49] <Uhkis> nascro: just use css max-height?
[22:32:55] <nascro> @Uhkis: Thanks for the suggestion. Adding a max-height:500px; (for example) to the .map-menu-container gives me unintended results.
[22:33:50] <nascro> @Uhkis: I don’t want the content under the submenu (namely, the other submenus and the unordered list/buttons) to disappear
[22:37:09] <Uhkis> nascro: i think you want ul.routes, not .map-menu-container
[22:37:41] <Uhkis> or i don't have a clue what you mean
[22:43:23] <nascro> @Uhkis: That seems to work as I explained it. You can see that if all of the menus are open, the map-menu-container extends past the viewport. Any thoughts on how I could keep the entire map-menu-container in the viewport and less of one of the submenus (which would then be scrollable)?
[22:54:39] <kostodo> If I have a json with 3 nested objects. How do I print the value of the last object?
[22:54:51] <kostodo> data.foo.bar.value does not work
[22:55:20] <kostodo> data[‘foo’][‘bar’][‘value’] also doesn’t
[22:59:52] <handoyo> hi all,i have this situation,i'm using isotope to sort products,and i'm trying to load other products via json.Is it possible to use existing js code that apply the isotope instead of applying new to js code?Thanks
[23:38:59] <mdev> I want to restrict certain characters in input boxes
[23:39:14] <mdev> I get how to do this with keypresses but what about pastes
[23:39:41] <mdev> I detect pastest fine, but the content is already there, I suppose i'll have to strip the characters and reset the textbox value?
[23:40:01] <mdev> was hoping for a preventive way though not aftermath
[23:41:33] <Uhkis> mdev: put an on('change') listener on it?
[23:42:11] <Uhkis> it would fix both cases
[23:42:21] <mdev> well I have .change( function(){
[23:42:59] <mdev> same difference or is on better?
[23:44:17] <Uhkis> change() should work fine
[23:45:58] <mdev> well change doesn't fire unless after the fact as in, when you type text/paste it, only when you lose focus/click outside will change detect
[23:46:13] <mdev> that's why I detect paste/cuts and key input as well for more real-time detection
[23:47:01] <mdev> unfortunately on firefox mobile because of auto complete or something it doesn't detect keys being pressed but I googled a work around, anyway I guess all I can do with my issue is strip characters that aren't allowed
[23:47:13] <mdev> and block them when they try and type
[23:52:30] <Unopoo> how do I determine if the selection I made contain an item that .attr("checked")==true?
