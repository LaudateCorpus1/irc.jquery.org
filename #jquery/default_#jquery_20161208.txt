[04:23:46] <emilkarl> Anyone familiar with interactjs?
[04:23:56] <emilkarl> trying to trigger a manual resize.

[05:38:24] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, i have a dozen elements with a class .action, inside a view that is loaded with jquery .load() - I attach the click even on action after the view is loaded... but then each time it reloads the view, it adds another click handler... and when using one() instead of on(), only 1 of the 12 action buttons work... how can this be resolved?
[06:00:44] <AgentCarmichael> My code doesn't work. Any idea  why? https://jsfiddle.net/cgwbmkzx/
[06:01:16] <AgentCarmichael> It's supposed to open two new tabs but nothing happens.
[06:03:16] <AgentCarmichael> Never mind, it works. Must be some browser setting.
[06:41:03] <akkonrad> I've included bootstrap.min.js library, but none of tooltips, dropdowns, tabs etc. is working. I'm using gulp to compile all js into one, so maybe I've messed something there? those are resources I'm compiling into one file: https://www.pastery.net/qbbhhx/
[06:43:12] <akkonrad> there is no errors, no warnings etc. nothign is worknig
[06:43:23] <akkonrad> like files would not be even compiled
[06:55:33] <AdamPDotty> now people come her and complain, they do not have errors
[08:17:16] <KnightsOfNi> Loading some html with .load() and attach some click event handlers after load is complete. How can you avoid that these handlers are attached each time you load the view?
[08:32:40] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: delegate the event handler to a static parent one time instead of for each time you load more
[08:43:19] <`ULT> Hello, I need the sum of all rowPrice`s
[08:43:34] <`ULT> I thougt this will do the trick:
[08:43:34] <`ULT>  $(".rowTotalPrice").find("span").each(function() {
[08:43:34] <`ULT>     totalTotalPrice += Number($(this).text()).toFixed(2);
[08:43:34] <`ULT>   });
[08:43:49] <`ULT> But I get a unexpected result. Any idea?
[08:44:05] <`ULT> I have a Fiddle
[08:45:36] <`ULT> I have read that this is also possible with reduce (maybe better) but I realy dont know why the += solution is not working
[08:46:33] <shoky_> `ULT: .toFixed() returns a string
[08:47:58] <shoky_> if you want to round the number you can e.g.  Math.floor(num*100)/100
[08:48:22] <`ULT> You are right, I see now in the documentation. But also without toFixed it is not working like expected
[08:48:26] <`ULT> I will try your solution
[08:48:36] <shoky_> or wrap Number() again i guess
[08:49:33] <`ULT> this is the fiddle, without the toFixed it is working better
[08:49:37] <`ULT> but still not summing the values
[08:49:38] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/zqt9yh52/2/
[08:49:51] <`ULT> I think I`m missing a very basic thing
[08:50:09] <`ULT> dont look to the html ;)
[09:27:00] <`ULT> Oke the problem was something small, I did totalTotalPrice = "" instead of totalTotalPrice = 0;
[10:10:47] <ExeciN> how can I make a test case substituting $.getJSON(endpoint, function(result)); with the actual JSON array like var myJSON = '["test":"ing"]';
[10:11:32] <taplar> what is your testing framework?
[10:12:12] <taplar> *library
[10:12:48] <ExeciN> no I just want to sent an isolated test case on jsfiddle or something similar
[10:13:22] <taplar> if you look on the LHS of jsfiddle there are some notes on making dummy ajax requests
[10:13:45] <ExeciN> yeah but I want real data
[10:14:04] <taplar> so make a real call?
[10:14:21] <taplar> you can give real data to those dummy ajax calls, btw
[10:14:23] <ExeciN> api end point doesn't accept cross-domain calls
[10:14:24] <taplar> they are echos
[10:14:32] <ExeciN> oh cool
[10:14:38] <taplar> so you didn't read it at all, :)
[10:15:29] <ExeciN> I've seen echo/json but I didn't know it works as an actual endpoint
[10:15:38] <taplar> lol. how else would it work?
[10:16:50] <taplar> but in any case, you can use testing libraries like jasmine to do tests for these things too pretty easily without the need for the ajax call to happen at all
[10:17:00] <taplar> allows you to test -only- the callback logic
[10:17:12] <taplar> *if you don't have it extracted
[10:17:46] <ExeciN> what about other places than jsfiddle? codepen.io for example. I could have my json array in a variable. Can I use that variable in the same way as I was going to use result in $.getJSON(endopoint, function(result));
[10:18:26] <taplar> i'm only familiar with jsfiddle to some degree.  i'm unaware if other sites have an echo option
[10:44:59] <verax5> how do i check if ALL values are empty?
[10:44:59] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/Mka0J
[10:48:55] <taplar> graph_data is an object?
[10:52:34] <taplar> Object.values({a:'1', b:''}).filter(function(val){ return !val === false; }).length    possibly
[10:58:56] <verax5> thanks taplar : )
[11:01:00] <taplar> np, :D
[11:27:08] <geiregjo> Hi
[11:27:17] <taplar> salutations!
[11:27:48] <geiregjo> I've been struggling with this jQuery UI Draggable issue for two days. I was hoping I can get some help here.
[11:28:10] <geiregjo> Since it's IE11 only not a lot of people have interest :D
[11:28:11] <cjohnson> ExeciN: JSON is a string, objects and arrays are data
[11:28:21] <cjohnson> ExeciN: if you have JSON, it doesn't matter hwere it came from, you can always JSON.parse it
[11:28:24] <geiregjo> I made a StackOverflow entry that explains the issue. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41021328/jquery-ui-draggable-pushed-upwards-on-mousedown-in-ie11
[11:28:29] <cjohnson> ExeciN: to get objects
[11:36:18] <geiregjo> If anyone has a hunch
[11:36:21] <geiregjo> ...
[11:59:34] <jquery820> How can I stop a counter that i converted to hh:mm:ss from showing the "hour" counter? I only need MM:SS   http://jsfiddle.net/b62jC/26/
[12:04:37] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/b62jC/27/ ?
[12:05:19] <taplar> do you understand what substr() is doing?
[12:05:52] <jquery820> not entirely, I was just messing around with it though and found out 14, 5 gives me what I'm looking for
[12:06:39] <taplar> substr(x, y) is taking a substring of the string, starting at position x and including y characters from there
[12:07:17] <jquery820> so if I remove the numbers and show the whole timestamp
[12:07:29] <jquery820> 14 is pos. x? and 5 is pos. y?
[12:11:48] <robertmaxrees> 14 is the position.
[12:11:52] <robertmaxrees> 5 is the number of chars.
[12:21:37] <robertmaxrees> g-g-g-g g-unit tests
[12:28:07] <cjohnson> lol
[12:28:14] <cjohnson> I just groaned out loud
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> #boom
[12:38:10] <taplar> mmmm soup
[12:40:33] <porton> I have a plaintext string (with possible <, >, & chars) and need to highlight all occurrences of "http://" in this string. How?
[12:42:11] <taplar> without a plugin, afaik, you'd have to manipulate the string to wrap the pieces in a span or something that you could style
[12:42:27] <porton> taplar: I know. My question is HOW to wrap?
[12:43:06] <taplar> wrapping is hard, but one thing you should know.  you have to cease the moment and don't let it pass you by.  and don't blow it
[12:43:15] <taplar> sease?
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> cease
[12:43:19] <taplar> seeze?
[12:43:24] <taplar> sorry
[12:43:27] <MikeD_> sieze
[12:43:30] <taplar> boom
[12:43:36] <robertmaxrees> *seize
[12:43:49] <MikeD_> carpe diem
[12:44:18] <taplar> porton: first work on tokenizing the string into the pieces that should and should not be wrapped
[12:44:37] <taplar> or this might be a regex solution possibly
[12:45:00] <MikeD_> where are you displaying it to be highlighted?
[12:45:16] <porton> taplar: I think rehex would not work due to character entities (which may meet instead of plain chars)
[12:45:30] <porton> MikeD_: On a Web page I am making for my own use
[12:45:45] <taplar> you mean like &amp; ?
[12:45:51] <porton> taplar: yes
[12:45:55] <MikeD_> literal match on https?:\/\/ shouldn't be difficult at all
[12:45:58] <taplar> fk, lol
[12:46:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd cheat and just .replace('http://', '<span>http://</span>') or something.
[12:46:23] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_'s solutuion works, too.
[12:46:55] <porton> robertmaxrees: Then after HTML-izing the string I would have http://&lt;span&gt;http://&lt;/span&gt;
[12:46:57] <porton> :-(
[12:47:04] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:47:10] <MikeD_> it gets weirder when you're actually trying to parse the path out and then get parameters from both the path and the querystring
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> ah i see what you mean.
[12:47:21] <robertmaxrees> you have to set using .html()
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and we can show you.
[12:47:34] <robertmaxrees> although now i have to ask: why not do this server-side?
[12:47:55] <porton> robertmaxrees: for the same reason
[12:48:33] <robertmaxrees> same reason as...?
[12:48:36] <porton> robertmaxrees: what to put into the fiddle?
[12:48:47] <robertmaxrees> and example.
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> a test-case.
[12:49:05] <porton> robertmaxrees: the same difficulty I have in JavaScript would appear in server-side code
[12:49:38] <robertmaxrees> sure, but at the very least you wouldn't burden the browser with that workload and cause page perf issues :)
[12:52:18] <MikeD_> wait, what workload is there in parsing a string to highlight "http" ?
[12:52:44] <porton> I don't know how to manage Fiddle to work. I will use the idea to tokenize the string. Now I think I know how to do it
[12:52:49] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:52:55] <robertmaxrees> "a string" in this case could potentially be pretty large.
[12:53:05] <robertmaxrees> and adding markup like that on the fly can be sketch.
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> also: porton you just need to put in an example of a string.
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:53:49] <MikeD_> and if you wanted to replace the whole string to be <a href="wholestring"><span>http://</span>the_rest</a>  you wouldn't have to worry about breaking the functionality of the link
[12:53:51] <porton> MikeD_: I need to replace http:// with // because we are switching to HTTPS in some HTML files (after a manual review, for which I need to highlight all http://)
[12:54:05] <taplar> wha?
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:54:12] <taplar> use an ide dude
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:54:19] <robertmaxrees> that's a super quick search/replace.
[12:54:20] <taplar> find all in files
[12:54:23] <porton> robertmaxrees: the string may be any HTML file or HTML file fragment
[12:54:31] <taplar> yup.  find all in files
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't use client-side js for this.
[12:54:44] <taplar> notepad++, sublime, others.  this exists
[12:55:06] <taplar> hell if you want to go commando, heh, you could even probably grep
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> on windows it's ctrl+shift+f in most editors to bring up the find/replace in all files dealiop.
[12:55:12] <MikeD_> ever notice how the first response to "How do i ... " is "You're doing it wrong"  :)
[12:55:19] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[12:55:28] <robertmaxrees> this is just a great XY problem :)
[12:55:30] <porton> robertmaxrees: why? I have an i7 machine. or do you advise me to put the electricity bills burden on my employer instead of myself? :-)
[12:55:30] <taplar> "your making it hard on yourself"
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> porton it's to save you time.
[12:55:47] <taplar> as opposed to "your doing it wrong"
[12:56:03] <robertmaxrees> instead of needing to wade through everything manually.  super quick change.
[12:56:16] <porton> robertmaxrees: the files are on a server, opening them in a text editor and making search-replace would be difficult
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't make anything though.
[12:56:34] <MikeD_> idk, we had a lot of generated content put in blobs and other horrible design legacy... the only place it showed up in a way you could care about as a whole page was after the bits got put together
[12:56:38] <robertmaxrees> and you should be able to download a local copy to work through...
[12:56:50] <taplar> sftp, mget
[12:56:59] <porton> robertmaxrees: the number of files is too big, I won't download them
[12:57:01] <MikeD_> so if you wanted an audit to have someone fix their broken, you'd rather that be on the page before they hit "publish all the things"
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> porton whaaaa
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> do you guys not have a vcs you deploy from?
[12:57:33] <taplar> msg robertmaxrees lmfao
[12:57:35] <MikeD_> but yeah, we could have just left the "notify/highlight" as a "fix all the broken" and that'd be sanctioning the wrong.
[12:57:36] <taplar> oops
[12:57:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:57:41] * taplar blushes
[12:58:00] <porton> robertmaxrees: It is exactly the problem that we don't have a VCS
[12:58:18] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't see the issue with downloading the site.  shouldn't take that long really.
[12:58:22] <porton> why do you advise me to do it on the server, not in my browser?
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> in this case i advise neither.
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:58:46] <porton> robertmaxrees: there is more than million files there
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> so you're going to browse through a million files?
[12:59:14] <robertmaxrees> that won't take too long?
[12:59:17] <MikeD_> sounds like a job for a 301 redirect and leave early for the pub
[12:59:26] <porton> I can write a script to download only needed files, but this way it would cause some troubles
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh
[12:59:37] <taplar> i was actually thinking about that.  .htaccess to the rescue
[12:59:48] <robertmaxrees> hell i'd write a bash script or something and let it run overnight or w/e
[12:59:58] <robertmaxrees> but hey, your time to waste i suppose.
[13:00:41] <MikeD_> we'll never reach the future if we spend the present fixing the past
[13:00:49] <taplar> am i to understand correctly, that these files on the server are not in any sort of a repo?
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:00:58] <porton> taplar: correctly
[13:00:59] <robertmaxrees> no vcs
[13:01:06] <taplar> what happens if the server crashes?
[13:01:13] <porton> taplar: we have a backup
[13:01:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> is the backup onsite?
[13:01:42] <porton> robertmaxrees: I haven't asked this
[13:01:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> and also: is that backup just a copy of the files?
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> because if so, you're facing some real downtime.
[13:02:17] <porton> robertmaxrees: I think, it is compressed and versioned, but I am not suree
[13:02:26] <robertmaxrees> versioned how
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:02:27] <MikeD_> south park just finished a season where they blew up the internet between a massive trolling and a spacex experiment... what if that really happens?  :p
[13:02:32] <taplar> backed up nightly or something?
[13:02:43] <porton> taplar: I think, nightly
[13:02:49] <taplar> probably a timestamped file name
[13:04:22] <robertmaxrees> so if production gets hosed you're doing a file transfer to a new box, and then once that finishes you're unzipping that and waiting.
[13:04:46] <taplar> this server a windows or linux box?
[13:05:13] <porton> taplar: freebsd
[13:05:19] <taplar> so linux
[13:05:39] <robertmaxrees> ish
[13:05:46] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-to-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-on-linux
[13:06:34] <porton> taplar: No need for such an advice. I am a good Linux expert
[13:06:41] <taplar> awesome
[13:07:46] <taplar> could even pipe the results to a text file for your perusing
[13:07:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:08:02] <taplar> but, you'd know this
[13:09:13] <cjohnson> while [ true ]; do cat .zshrc > .zshrc; done
[13:10:21] <porton> What is the easiest way to tokenize a string into two kinds of tokens: 1. "http://"; 2. all the rest combinations of symbolds?
[13:10:25] <porton> *symbols
[13:10:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:16:17] <taplar> i'm still unclear on this
[13:16:27] <taplar> are you writing a greasemonkey script or something?
[13:17:07] <porton> taplar: I don't. I just create a simple client-server system to solve a particular task
[13:17:29] <taplar> but how are you going to apply the script against the files?
[13:17:59] <porton> taplar: http://stackoverflow.com/q/41037415/856090
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need a server-side script at some point anyway.
[13:18:46] <taplar> so... your not going to do this with js now?
[13:18:47] <robertmaxrees> why not start there?
[13:18:49] <taplar> so confused
[13:19:34] <porton> taplar: I see no arguments in either direction whether to do tokenizing and <span>-wrapping in server or in client (except that doing it in the client reduces traffic a little)
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't see much debate between the two because the "right" way is kind of obvious heh.
[13:20:19] <taplar> in that SO post?  it's doing a regex
[13:21:00] <taplar> $Text =~ s{http://}{//}gi; <-- unless i'm misunderstanding that, that's regex
[13:21:10] <porton> taplar: yes, that's a regex
[13:21:27] <taplar> so if your doing the replacement with regex, there is no need to do any of the span business
[13:21:34] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[13:21:38] <robertmaxrees> you can just one-pass all of this.
[13:21:43] <robertmaxrees> no need to manually audit anything.
[13:22:04] <porton> taplar: my work splits into two stages: highlighting http:// and then (by a separate button) replacing http:// with //
[13:22:14] <taplar> why?
[13:22:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:22:39] <taplar> 'highlighting' assumes your going to visit each one in a browser
[13:22:49] <robertmaxrees> is it to make sure you host the asset?
[13:22:50] <porton> taplar: yes
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:06] * taplar bangs his head on the wall
[13:23:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you visiting each one in a browser?
[13:23:16] <porton> robertmaxrees: it is to make sure that replacing http:// -> // won't break anything
[13:23:25] <taplar> why would it?
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> taplar it can cause errors for resources that don't support https
[13:23:41] <porton> taplar: in references to external HTTP-only sites
[13:23:42] <taplar> true, but other than that
[13:23:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:23:49] <porton> taplar: no other
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:54] <robertmaxrees> just do it then.
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> no need to walk through your millions of files.
[13:24:31] <porton> robertmaxrees: I filter out (by path) that folder with million files
[13:24:33] <taplar> hold on
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> porton wait wait wait
[13:24:38] <taplar> unless he is a freelancer
[13:24:44] <taplar> and is paid by the hour
[13:24:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:24:57] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you can download just the files you care about.
[13:25:18] <MassDebates> y'know robertmaxrees
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:25:33] <MassDebates> They say the value of the destination is rated by the distance of the journey ;P
[13:25:35] <porton> robertmaxrees: why to download, when I can do it on the server (and thus reduce the likehood that somebody other will overwrite the same file as me)
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> then just do it server-side.
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm just pokin' holes here.
[13:25:53] <porton> robertmaxrees: why?
[13:25:56] <taplar> MassDebates: sure, gas and airline fuel costs money
[13:26:01] <MassDebates> lol
[13:26:11] <MassDebates> Hey man
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> earlier it was that you couldn't download the whole codebase because it's millions of files.  now it's that you only care about a subset.
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> just run a ser
[13:26:26] <taplar> you set it up, i'll punt it, ;)
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> *server-side script and call it a day.
[13:26:37] <robertmaxrees> seems like an awful lot of roundabout effort is all.
[13:27:15] <MassDebates> More like I say something that seems "awfully prophetic and insightful" and you sandbag me by kicking me in the side :P
[13:27:49] <taplar> i'm just a plebeian.  i don't get these things
[13:28:00] <MassDebates> that's right. Get down, scum.
[13:28:03] <MassDebates> xD
[13:28:10] <taplar> woah, hold on.  i bathe
[13:28:18] <taplar> weekly
[13:28:31] <shoky_> in pig sweat
[13:28:37] <MassDebates> That's pretty good, actually. you'll look like a king cause you ain't got shit all over ya.
[13:28:40] <taplar> what else is there?
[13:28:49] <shoky_> pig vomit, duh
[13:28:49] <MassDebates> i bathe in the sweat of virgins.
[13:28:51] <taplar> nyce
[13:29:00] <taplar> @ the monty reference
[13:29:07] <MassDebates> Thanks
[13:29:14] <MassDebates> I was worried nobody would pick it up.
[13:29:43] <MassDebates> Because usually I reference something way more obscure with less production/writing quality and then I just seem like some crazy fool
[13:29:50] <MassDebates> Now I'm just a fool :P
[13:31:32] <taplar> probably the only one of theirs i have watched
[13:31:44] <taplar> though i think i saw the parrot sketch
[13:31:59] <MassDebates> Nah
[13:32:01] <MassDebates> You were in ipswitch
[13:32:06] <MassDebates> We're in uh
[13:32:10] <MassDebates> Some other place in england
[13:32:30] * taplar glances back at the obscure comment
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> holy cripes today is flying.
[13:39:16] <taplar> oh?
[13:40:20] * taplar asks while submitting a vacation request
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> just a lot going on.  been ordering a bunch of stuff from my site.
[13:46:33] <taplar> nice, getting prepared to move back into the house?
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> not yet.
[13:46:46] <robertmaxrees> middle of january or so.
[13:51:16] <ExeciN> I'm trying to remove a class from an element but it doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bBKKvJ?editors=1011
[13:51:45] <taplar> which one is failing?
[13:51:53] <robertmaxrees> do you mean #subjects .active
[13:53:37] <taplar> does codepen have a tidy option?
[13:53:49] <taplar> yay
[13:56:15] <taplar> $("button.active").removeClass("active");
[13:56:28] <taplar> if i'm understanding your intent
[13:57:01] <z1haze_work> I have a slider-timer animation kinda thing.. just an element that spans underneight my slides than goes from 0 to 100% width
[13:57:20] <z1haze_work> im wondering how I can make it animate rather than jerk into position?
[13:58:15] <taplar> can you show us what you currently have?
[13:58:23] <z1haze_work> yea let me push it live
[13:59:22] <z1haze_work> http://oblivion-networks.hendricksweb.com/
[13:59:40] <z1haze_work> its a template im working from and the slider is custom so i just went in and added a little of my own to try to add this functionality, wasnt too difficult except for the jumping
[13:59:59] <z1haze_work> i think i see why though
[14:00:01] <ExeciN> taplar: ah my selector was wrong
[14:00:06] <z1haze_work> its on a set interval for 1 second
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN like i pointed out?
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:00:57] <taplar> z1haze_work: so it's just a div that you are changing the width on?
[14:01:02] <z1haze_work> basically yea
[14:01:03] <ExeciN> robertmaxrees: yeah I was selecting #subjects I should be selecting button
[14:01:10] <z1haze_work> i think i know what i need to do
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN ah
[14:01:16] <taplar> how are you changing the width?
[14:01:20] <z1haze_work> just need to recalculate more than every second
[14:01:27] <z1haze_work> i tried setting a css transition but that made it not end at the right time
[14:01:28] <taplar> or use css for this
[14:01:35] <z1haze_work> and just with whatever time he had calculated
[14:01:45] <z1haze_work> i gotta get to a meeting i know this was terrible time,  thanks :\
[14:03:52] <`ULT> Hello, is something like this $("td").find("span.class"); faster than $("td span.class"); or even $(".class");
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[14:04:21] <taplar> is that class only on the spans you care about?
[14:04:38] <`ULT> yes only span with class .class (example)
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to read http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[14:05:05] <taplar> ^ in this case i'd probably just use the class
[14:05:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:05:29] <`ULT> Personaly I think it is faster first to declare the td and than search in td for class
[14:05:34] <`ULT> But I realy dont know
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:05:36] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[14:05:39] <taplar> think of it this way
[14:05:52] <taplar> $('.class') ~== document.getElementsByClassName('class')
[14:05:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:06:02] <taplar> one action
[14:06:04] <robertmaxrees> or document.querySelectorAll depending
[14:06:07] <taplar> sure
[14:06:19] <`ULT> Allright, so no fancy stuff
[14:06:25] <`ULT> just (".class");
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> pretty much all the basic css selectors delegate to the browser.
[14:06:35] <robertmaxrees> also: perf is a funny thing.
[14:06:41] <`ULT> But what I see alot in scripts is .find()
[14:06:43] <`ULT> why is that?
[14:06:45] <robertmaxrees> you're talking milliseconds for selecting.
[14:06:47] <taplar> scope
[14:06:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.someThing')
[14:07:05] <robertmaxrees> reduces collisions.
[14:07:17] <taplar> also if the first thing is a basic selector, super fast
[14:07:18] <robertmaxrees> or off of a stored result - $someObject.find()
[14:07:21] <`ULT> oke only than it make sense?
[14:07:38] <taplar> read that page robert linked.  it will help
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:07:43] <`ULT> Thanks, I wil check the url from Robdgreat
[14:07:45] <`ULT> robertmaxrees
[14:07:48] <`ULT> yes haha,
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> also reducing the number of times you call $() is a good idea
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> that's slower than almost all selectors.
[14:08:27] <`ULT> Oke good to know
[14:08:34] <robertmaxrees> also: don'
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> *don't prematurely optimize :)
[14:09:03] <`ULT> right, readybility before performance
[14:09:04] <`ULT> 12/5000
[14:09:04] <`ULT> readability
[14:09:07] <`ULT> hoow
[14:09:19] <taplar> yeah, absorb what best practices you can and then address performance if it becomes an issue
[14:09:25] <robertmaxrees> yup
[14:10:45] <`ULT> I think I should really make a mess of the code when it slows down a browser
[14:10:52] <`ULT> maybe with some loops
[14:11:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:11:52] <`ULT> Sorry, I mean that I should write realy bad code, if it creates significant slowdowns
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> wuh...
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:12:12] <`ULT> for example in a web page.
[14:12:12] <taplar> you should never write really bad code
[14:12:18] <`ULT> No I understand that haha
[14:12:27] <robertmaxrees> heh so then why are you saying you should?
[14:12:36] <`ULT> That`s why I try to write as clean as I can.
[14:12:47] <`ULT> No haha, that is not what I mean.
[14:14:49] <`ULT> I mean that chosing for ("td").find(".class") instead of (".class") is not making that mutch performance profit, or loss, to realy care about.
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:15:13] <taplar> you should also talk to your priest if your writing bad code.  i can understand someone writing inaccurate/flawed code, but bad code?  you needa get you some jesus
[14:15:16] <robertmaxrees> which is why you worry about writing clean code.
[14:15:34] <taplar> :D
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[14:16:00] <`ULT> haaha
[14:16:28] <`ULT> Allright, thx for the info.
[14:17:12] <taplar> the point really isn't about which one is better or worse.  the point is how much time you are spending on finding the 'perfect' solution
[14:17:25] <`ULT> first sentence: Selector optimization is less important than it used to be
[14:17:28] <`ULT> ^^
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:38] <robertmaxrees> knowing when to optimize is important, too.
[14:18:28] <taplar> code the best you can with what you know, fix performance issues when they happen, if you learn something new refactor if you have time, apply the knowledge going forward, and be happy
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> and for the love of all that is good, just keep writing code.
[14:19:16] <`ULT> best way to learn indeed, write!
[14:19:36] <`ULT> interesting article
[14:19:44] <taplar> at some point you will be spending more time solving business problems than coding problems
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:20:28] <`ULT> that should be nice indeed
[14:20:38] <taplar> eh, that can be a pita too, ;)
[14:20:40] <taplar> sometimes more so
[14:20:47] <taplar> cause you have the human element, :D
[14:21:00] <taplar> those guys sux
[14:21:11] <`ULT> hahaaha, right!
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> eventually the codebase should make that trivial.
[14:22:05] <`ULT> I read "drop the middle if possible" I guess the middle because of readability
[14:22:19] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[14:22:27] <`ULT> $( ".data table.attendees td.gonzalez" );   >  $( ".data td.gonzalez" );
[14:22:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:22:34] <`ULT> But could be also $( ".gonzalez" );
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> stop trying to decide how the browser should do things.
[14:22:55] <robertmaxrees> and that assumes you don't have .gonzalez under other elements.
[14:23:04] <`ULT> oke than it is right indeed.
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> the idea is descriptive vs. prescriptive
[14:23:11] <`ULT> but when we have only 1 element .gonzalez
[14:23:15] <`ULT> that would be oke also
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> it's why forEach is better than for loops.
[14:34:07] <newbie007> I have a bunch of div's with the same class.  How can I loop through them and find the one with the largest height and make all of them that same height?
[14:34:27] <taplar> this sounds like a SO question that was asked the otherday
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:34:41] <taplar> if possible you should use display table-cell/table-row to do this
[14:36:15] <taplar> be funny if i gave the same guy the same answer in two different places, :D
[14:36:21] <Ahiiru> hello there
[14:36:47] <Ahiiru> I have this piece of code that I know that is conflicting with a plugin called Revolution Slider: http://pastebin.com/aTLrE4BS
[14:37:09] <Ahiiru> what could I do to avoid the conflit?
[14:37:21] <robertmaxrees> how are they conflicting?
[14:38:10] <Ahiiru> it makes some button/links of Revolution Slider to do nothing when on click
[14:38:31] <robertmaxrees> i wonder why,...
[14:39:14] <Ahiiru> you think there's nothing obvious there?
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> this creates a new method on the jquery object.
[14:39:51] <Ahiiru> I guess I should use jquery noconflict over this code
[14:39:55] <robertmaxrees> no idea why that conflicts with a plugin.
[14:39:56] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> that won't fix the problem.
[14:40:43] <Ahiiru> I'll update the code with the whole code
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle instead.
[14:42:39] <taplar> this is really hard to read
[14:42:49] <Ahiiru> hm ok
[14:45:06] <taplar> something about line 16 seems flawed
[14:45:38] <taplar> like if i'm reading this right it could result in some case as obj[n] = [ obj[n], v ]
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah i wouldn't worry about it.
[14:46:02] * taplar fights his ocd
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> looks like a weird convenience thing,.
[14:46:37] <taplar> seems like it could be easier with a serializeArray and then a reduce
[14:46:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:46:48] <robertmaxrees> or just use serializeArray.
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:47:08] <taplar> but he's wanting an obj, right?  not an array of key values
[14:47:18] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[14:47:22] <taplar> idk, heh
[14:48:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:48:28] <Ahiiru> robertmaxrees: here's the code: https://jsfiddle.net/ahiru1/t3oycqh9/
[14:48:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:48:51] <Ahiiru> wrong again? :(
[14:48:51] <robertmaxrees> when we say "make a fiddle" we mean "make a functioning test case"
[14:48:59] <Ahiiru> oh :(
[14:49:18] <robertmaxrees> that being said, which parts of the code are actually relevant?
[14:49:38] <Ahiiru> that wont be possible/fast, it's in my localhost -sobs
[14:49:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:49:49] <Ahiiru> hmm
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> it's totally possible and could be fast lol.  but which part of this breaks?
[14:50:15] <Ahiiru> its presence makes it break
[14:50:25] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[14:50:37] <Ahiiru> when I remove this .js from the call, the Revolution Slider works again
[14:50:54] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[14:53:02] <Ahiiru> TypeError: $(...).offset(...) is undefined
[14:53:04] <Ahiiru> hmm
[14:53:41] <Ahiiru> line 138
[15:04:05] <Ahiiru> robertmaxrees: maybe this helps? http://imgur.com/a/NoZH3
[15:31:21] <adavia> Hi!!
[15:32:14] <taplar> bonjour
[15:33:01] <adavia> Is there any way using css to apply the checked style to the previous stars http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1722/
[15:33:25] <taplar> that'd be a #css question
[15:33:37] <Calinou> yes but very hard, Lea Verou did it once, but I don't have a link, sorry
[15:33:40] <Calinou> (in pure CSS)
[15:33:45] <adavia> Damn
[15:39:23] <taplar> raitings
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> Ahiiru sorry was away.
[15:40:54] <robertmaxrees> so do you only get that error when that plugin is included?
[15:41:38] <Ahiiru> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:41:47] <adavia> taplar: yes sir
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:42:05] <taplar> ratings
[15:42:36] <robertmaxrees> Ahiiru that means $('.sidebar_roteiro') likely doesn't exist.
[15:43:40] <robertmaxrees> you should check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[15:43:49] <taplar> adavia: any who, i feel you could do this with a simple click handler, if you change them to be checkboxes rather than radios
[15:44:56] <adavia> Thought using radiobuttons and perhaps some tricky css would make it
[15:44:56] <Ahiiru> hm ok thanks
[15:45:03] <taplar> though i do like that your wanting an all css solution, :)
[15:45:29] <taplar> i'm sure you can do it, it's just the css from what i can imagine will be very large
[15:45:45] <taplar> since you have to deal with recursively dealing with sibling logic
[15:45:46] <adavia> well
[15:45:49] <adavia> i have seen this
[15:45:51] <adavia> http://www.cssscript.com/simple-5-star-rating-system-with-css-and-html-radios/
[15:46:13] <adavia> Tried to adapt most of it
[15:46:23] <taplar> oooooh, what does ~ do
[15:46:35] <adavia> i was wondering the same
[15:46:56] <robertmaxrees> general sibling iirc
[15:47:19] <taplar> so just a sibling, not forced to be immediate?
[15:48:37] <adavia> Umm
[15:49:11] <taplar> ahhh
[15:49:15] <taplar> all preceeding selector
[15:49:31] <taplar> well, not all
[15:49:35] <taplar> just the inverse of +
[15:49:50] <adavia> what do you mean
[15:49:51] <taplar> if you can trust w3cschools
[15:50:05] <adavia> Oh i usually not so much
[15:50:12] <taplar> good, ;)
[15:50:33] <taplar> in any case p + q would affect all q that follow a p
[15:50:46] <taplar> p ~ q, if this is right, would affect all p that preceed a q
[15:51:01] <robertmaxrees> quick test :)
[15:51:19] * taplar is adding another tool to his toolbox, ^_^
[16:00:49] <adavia> tried doing ~ i:before
[16:08:42] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1723/ pow
[16:09:13] <taplar> so that seems to say w3c was wrong
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> * w3schools
[16:09:25] <taplar> ~ seems to select all siblings after
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> w3c != w3schools
[16:09:30] <taplar> yeah, true, should make the distinction
[16:11:50] <deepy> w3schools has a history of being wrong
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:11:58] <taplar> bah, sorry
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:12:16] <taplar> it -is- selecting all previous siblings.  just the float reversing it made me think afterwards
[16:13:26] <adavia> taplar: i believe it only works with following siblings
[16:13:32] <taplar> previous
[16:13:41] <adavia> not preceding ones
[16:13:47] <taplar> no, it is preceeding
[16:14:00] <taplar> it looks like following because the css reverses the positions of the elements
[16:14:06] <taplar> but in the markup they are still 1-5
[16:14:17] <taplar> err, dom
[16:14:41] <taplar> that page you gave with the example had them in 5-1
[16:14:48] <taplar> which out of the box worked with ~
[16:15:02] <taplar> but since you swapped the order, you have to flip their position so it still looks like you wanted
[16:15:51] <adavia> taplar: it is kinda hard with my markup i guess
[16:15:53] <taplar> which, in light of that, the stars could probably use some sort of a legend
[16:17:04] <taplar> i think most users are used to LTR displays, but, i'm also american.  idk how like chinese/japanese/korean people would view that without a legend
[16:17:54] <adavia> havent think about that
[16:17:58] <taplar> ;)
[16:18:14] <robertmaxrees> assumes that you want to cater to those languages fwiw.
[16:18:21] <taplar> sure
[16:24:45] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1724/  well, has a legend but it looks like it is still wrong
[16:25:09] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:29:47] <adavia> taplar: applying the style through jquery guess would be easier in this case lol
[16:30:11] <taplar> or flip your arrangement from 1-5 to 5-1
[16:30:41] <adavia> does that affects the original markup?
[16:30:50] <taplar> yep, would have to change that
[16:30:59] <taplar> then you'd just take off the floats, i believe
[16:32:04] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1725/
[16:32:13] <taplar> which is pretty much what that page you linked was doing
[16:37:53] <z1haze> hey taplar are you still here - im sorry i left earlier, i had a dumb meeting - but im at home now still trying to fix that slider progress thing if you're able to look again
[16:38:21] <taplar> yup, though i'm fixing to go to the head.  iirc i had asked how you were changing the width
[16:40:12] <z1haze> looks like the majority of it happens here
[16:40:32] <z1haze> ive added in the percentage var as well as $sliderTimer and its css changes
[16:42:35] <z1haze> dur sorry. http://dpaste.com/3DXF21K
[16:43:17] <taplar> k, and do you have a transition: width 2s; or anything on that element?
[16:46:11] <z1haze> i did but it doesnt end up working right
[16:46:31] <z1haze> it starts at like 20% and ends at like 75% or something and then when it changes slides, it animates back from 75% to 0
[16:48:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pedoamu2/
[16:50:23] <z1haze> its not uniform
[16:50:27] <taplar> nope
[16:50:45] <taplar> cause the speed at which the width is changing is probably exceeding the time given to the css transition
[16:51:19] <taplar> so it gradually is expected to cover more space in 1s because the previous transition didn't finish
[16:51:31] <z1haze> i gotta figure out how this works i guess http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/development/camera_1.0.6/demo/features.htm
[16:52:09] <taplar> so you want it to be consistent like that?
[16:53:08] <z1haze> yea he pointed out that he wants like that lol
[16:53:26] <z1haze> i may have it!
[16:53:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pedoamu2/1
[16:54:23] <z1haze> nice i got it workin
[16:55:58] <z1haze> at least i think
[16:56:07] <z1haze> ill update you tell me what you think
[16:57:13] <z1haze> http://oblivion-networks.hendricksweb.com/ seem a little better?
[16:58:13] <taplar> is it supposed to loop?
[16:59:01] <taplar> ah ok
[16:59:10] <taplar> so its kinda showing the count down until the next slide
[17:00:42] <taplar> looks ok.  if possible to remove the bit where it slides back to the left that might be nicer
[17:02:42] <taplar> which would probably just be, remove the transistion, change it back to the base width, and put the transition back on
[17:43:21] <taplar> 1:17 until a 3 day weekend, ^_^
[17:43:29] <robertmaxrees> very nice
[18:06:20] <Daryn> Is anyone having issues with the jquery CDN?
[18:06:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:06:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to get ahold of somebody.
[18:07:47] <snover> this is just an unfriendly reminder not to rely on third-party hosts for making your web site work
[18:08:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:08:21] <robertmaxrees> is it maxcdn?
[18:08:36] * taplar thumbs up snover
[18:09:09] <Daryn> Thanks snover lol, fortunately I've realized that it's only effecting my def env. The live env seems fine but I'm unable to connect to code.jquery
[18:09:16] <taplar> i saw some code the other day that was pulling in from a cdn and then below was checking if it didn't work and if it didn't was pulling in a local copy.
[18:09:25] <taplar> confused the f out of me for a bit until someone explained that to me
[18:09:35] <snover> that fragment of code has existed for a long time
[18:09:41] <snover> it’s still a bad idea.
[18:10:16] <Daryn> Yeah.. that's probably a good idea. Just move it to local. Still find it odd that I can't connect to the code.jquery page
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> i've been scrambling to find somebody to fix.
[18:10:50] <robertmaxrees> i just reached out to maxcdn.  maybe they can fix it (shrug)
[18:15:08] <taplar> Daryn: if it is only affecting your dev environment you could try changing it to the google cdn for now
[18:15:24] <Daryn> The other CDNs are working at http://jquery.com/download/#other-cdns
[18:15:55] <Daryn> Thanks taplar! I just switched and grabbed a local copy for the future as well.
[18:16:06] <taplar> cool
[18:17:20] <norotartagen> do you get "too many redirects" when you go here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js ?
[18:17:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:26] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:17:29] <robertmaxrees> the CDN is hosed atm.
[18:17:33] <Daryn> same here
[18:17:34] <taplar> the flood begins
[18:17:37] <robertmaxrees> trying to get ahold of somebody.
[18:17:38] <Daryn> haha
[18:18:04] <Daryn> robertmaxrees - the other CDNs are working - http://jquery.com/download/#other-cdns
[18:18:33] <robertmaxrees> Daryn that's not really helpful for me ;)
[18:18:42] <taplar> there may be prod environments else where that are using the failing cdn, so getting it to work is kinda a big thing
[18:18:50] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[18:18:58] <robertmaxrees> i already host jquery myself, but literally thousands of sites were likely just impacted.
[18:19:04] <taplar> that's what i'm saying
[18:19:18] <norotartagen> woohoo
[18:21:45] <Daryn> robertmaxrees - gotcha, definitely worth contacting someone!
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> already fixed.
[18:21:54] <robertmaxrees> so everything is fine.
[18:26:16] <Daryn> That was a quick snaffu..
[18:26:27] <taplar> that's what she said
[18:26:42] <robertmaxrees> *snafu ;)
[18:27:04] <taplar> quick, and inaccurate.  TOTALLY what she said
[18:47:07] <taplar> heh http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41050480/understanding-cdns
[18:47:20] <taplar> go get you some points man
[18:47:28] <taplar> buy some bubble gum with it
[19:11:46] <z1haze> anyone know how to require a certain version ofa package with bower, when you are url the git url?
[19:13:03] <robertmaxrees> point it to that particular sha
[19:13:08] <robertmaxrees> or version tag
[22:04:26] <Jagst3r15> in URL encoding how do you have an empty paramter?
[22:05:21] <Jagst3r15> if you have a url like http://example.com/ranking?position=QB&year=2017 and you have a button called "all years" how do you set &year= to just be blank so it shows all
[22:37:23] <jquery265> uhh hey
[22:38:34] <jquery265> hi
