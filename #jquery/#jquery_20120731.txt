[00:13:27] <mindis|wurk> hola chaps. would anyone happen to know how i could track changes in an iframes documents height?
[00:14:14] <heshanh> cant u check if thres a scroll or not on the iframe
[00:14:36] <heshanh> never done it, just throwing ideas out there
[00:15:04] <mindis|wurk> more specifically perhaps i'm interested in what events i could track for when the height changes
[00:16:47] <heshanh> maybe bubble up a click event from the iframe content for your page and fix the height?
[00:18:16] <coldhead> abandon all hope, ye who use iframes here
[00:18:27] <ktstowell> well it's technically its own window, have you tried calling window.resize on it?
[00:18:33] <mindis|wurk> yes
[00:20:40] <mindis|wurk> the problem with that approach was that it doesn't appear to trigger a resize event when the content of the page changes
[00:31:25] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[00:33:08] <elisa87> Hi do you know how can I add a jQuery/Ajax up/down/ left and right buttons? Is there any specific pluggin for this purpose? like jwplayer for shockwave!
[00:36:11] <xec> elisa87: you'll have to explain closer what you're trying to do, as "ajax up button" doesn't make much sense.
[00:39:29] <coldhead> when someone presses the up button, ajax is done
[00:40:05] <elisa87> xec I want to control a blimp and need to control it using up/down/right/left buttons... do you know any premade pluggins?
[00:40:46] <xec> elisa87: nope, but you can easily listen to keypresses, i'm sure google will help you with that part ;)
[00:45:21] <elisa87> I don't want to listen to keypresses! I want to have a nice button named up/down////
[00:45:21] <elisa87> any help?
[00:45:22] <xec> elisa87: well, you can even more easily listen to click on a button. what part are you struggling with
[00:45:22] <xec> elisa87: is this some homework assignment?
[00:45:22] <coldhead> http://mottie.github.com/Keyboard/
[00:54:06] <coldhead> and everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope in the mouth of the south below
[01:04:42] <rethus> i have this inside of my sourcecode, but the car are not available, why http://jsfiddle.net/mmVRG/1/
[01:05:06] <rethus> A_DISPLAY_GsbTab_SchadenFahrer is not defined, if i try to call it
[01:06:35] <rethus> got it
[01:06:51] <coldhead> do you want a stern lecture about not using global variables anyway?
[01:08:43] <Koopz> howdy
[01:09:09] <coldhead> hiya Koopz
[01:09:15] <hooloovoo> o/
[01:09:46] <Koopz> can i ask for some help here? :P
[01:10:07] <coldhead> please do
[01:10:17] <mindis|wurk> he's lying, you will turn into a toad if you do
[01:10:32] <coldhead> do it anyway, it's worth it
[01:10:34] <coldhead> toad power!
[01:10:43] <gabriel1> Guys, I have an PHP array with X numbers of arrays in each cell. Can I, with jquery fetch this array and traverse it with key/value pair?
[01:10:45] <mindis|wurk> all hail the hypnotoad
[01:10:45] <Koopz> in that case..
[01:11:01] <hooloovoo> gabriel1: yes, with ajax
[01:11:23] <gabriel1> ah great
[01:11:33] <gabriel1> will google
[01:11:44] <Koopz> i need a way to wait for a trigger()-call to complete
[01:12:36] <boulet101010> hail to the toad
[01:12:54] <Koopz> im getting a list of options for my select-box via ajax and set its default value after that
[01:14:44] <elisa87> Hi, how can I create a side bar menu using Ajax? any help or link?
[01:15:18] <coldhead> gabriel1: you will want to use JSON to encode and decode the data
[01:15:21] <coldhead> so google that guy too
[01:15:59] <mindis|wurk> also remember to use utf8 encoded data with json_encode in php, otherwise you won't get anything out of it
[01:16:01] <ravenzz> elisa87 you want to create a sidebar from an ajax request?
[01:16:23] <ravenzz> or are you trying to have an ajax navigation
[01:16:48] <elisa87> yes ravenzz but I need a start point I am totally new to ajax
[01:17:03] <gabriel1> coldhead: yeah, Im reading some tutorials as we speak
[01:17:14] <elisa87> to be honest ravenzz I am not able to differentiate those two things you said
[01:17:22] <gabriel1> but a bit hard to digest
[01:17:27] <gabriel1> for me anyway :)
[01:17:39] <mindis|wurk> what you probably want has little to nothing to do with ajax
[01:17:42] <hooloovoo> elisa87: ummm. i think you need to be a bit more specific. why do you want a sidebar in ajax?
[01:17:46] <coldhead> you'll get the hang of it, gabriel1! #jQuery can help you
[01:18:05] <elisa87> I need a side bar menu to have some external links to some other pages ...
[01:18:24] <hooloovoo> elisa87: ajax is just passing data back and forth to the server without reloading the whole page
[01:18:32] <ravenzz> and whenever you click one of them the content is loaded in the same page?
[01:18:39] <hooloovoo> elisa87: so there are as many ways of making that sidebar as there are programmers.
[01:18:56] <mindis|wurk> usually one wouldn't use javascript for it at all...
[01:19:03] <hooloovoo> right
[01:19:05] <gabriel1> hmm, perhaps this is overkill for my task, I have an array in a hidden input field that I want to traverse and create options from
[01:20:43] <mindis|wurk> gabriel1 if the inputs are there when the document loads you don't need to make an ajax call to generate elements based on them
[01:21:21] <EnginA> can't i use .prop to set custom DOM attributes
[01:21:42] <EnginA> afaik, data-* namespace is 100% legal to use, but it seems like, it does not set my DOM attributes
[01:21:56] <mindis|wurk> it does if you use .attr
[01:22:00] <EnginA> I use custom DOM attributes when I write them manually
[01:22:01] <mindis|wurk> instead of .data
[01:22:02] <hooloovoo> EnginA: or .data
[01:22:04] <hooloovoo> ?
[01:22:05] <EnginA> mindis|wurk: nope
[01:22:17] <EnginA> not whati want, .attr docs tells me to use .prop for DOM attributes
[01:22:25] <EnginA> i tried attr first :)
[01:22:27] <mindis|wurk> :S
[01:22:49] <gabriel1> mindis|wurk: problem is that i need to get the key value aswell, but javascript is not supporting associative arrays right?
[01:22:52] <hooloovoo> EnginA: .prop is for properties. like selected
[01:23:41] <EnginA> ok, let me check what else could be wrong, i was using attr for all these kind of stuff too
[01:23:47] <EnginA> now it didn't work, guess the problem is somewhere else
[01:23:51] <mindis|wurk> gabriel1 it supports them in a sense in the form of objects. for example, {'foo':'bar'} is roughly the same as Array('foo' => 'bar') in php
[01:24:07] <mindis|wurk> though it's not a real array
[01:25:01] <gabriel1> the problem I have is to get the key so I can use it when I create my options
[01:25:25] <EnginA> what was the jq way of classical JS bind snippet ?
[01:25:38] <gabriel1> I found something on stackoverflow that im going to try
[01:28:36] <kolo> hallo in runtime I add element var foo = selector.append(element id="x")  and then into new added element with id="x" I want to add next element, but foo.append(new element)  doesn't go. Can you help me how can i solve it ?
[01:28:59] <EnginA> ok, now it works.
[01:31:12] <Koopz> ... is there some way to wait for a trigger()ed event to complete?
[01:38:28] <Koopz> meep?
[01:39:26] <faraway> no one here sorry
[01:45:12] <frigginCarebear> kolo: append returns a jQuery collection containing the original element, not what was appended
[01:46:32] <frigginCarebear> appendTo returns a collection containing the element that was appended
[01:46:57] <frigginCarebear> so foo.append(bar).append(bar) would get you <foo><bar/><baz/></foo>, baz.appendTo(bar).appendTo(foo) would get you <foo><bar><baz/></bar></foo>
[01:48:24] <frigginCarebear> foo.append(bar).children().append(baz) would also get you <foo><bar><baz/></bar></foo>, but is less reliable, I guess, depends if the element already contains children, otherwise you could filter the children() call with a selector matching bar
[01:57:13] <huntedmitch> frigginCarebear: Was that meant for me?
[01:57:30] <frigginCarebear> nah kolo
[01:57:39] <Koopz> some list of things that could go wrong if i update jquery?...
[01:57:57] <huntedmitch> frigginCarebear: I am using ZNC and sometimes I get random responses. Was SO confused just now! lol
[01:58:17] <joeyjones> frigginCarebear: i had to learn myself the proper way to sue appand, appendto, before, after, insertbefore, insertafter, etc.
[01:59:13] <joeyjones> oh, and after/before can be a pita
[01:59:30] <joeyjones> since after will put it after an opening tag, not after the closing tag :p
[02:05:53] <Koopz> i wonder if i can use this "when()"-thing with "trigger()"
[02:05:57] <r3v3rb> hi all, anyone use fancybox here?
[02:13:50] <r3v3rb> for some reason whether I use autoDImensions true or false the result is wrong in fancybox with inline content. I have specified a width in the css of the inline item, yet fancybox ignores it regardless
[02:34:42] <Koopz> hmm...that jquery gets too fast into my "then"-function ...
[02:40:51] <Koopz> maybe...i could make use of that "queue" i've never heard of...
[02:44:18] <Crucials> If I select more than one element, how can I tell inside a function which element out of the "options" was the one selected
[02:44:29] <Crucials> actually, that sounded really vague, but I dont know how to put it in one sentence
[02:57:04] <joesavage> Anyone know of any easy methods to perform client-side search of an XML sitemap via jQuery? I'm by no means a jQuery expert and need some kind of client-side search on my fully static (i.e. Jekyll-esque) site
[02:59:25] <faraway> Crucials: $("select :selected")  will this work for your case ?
[02:59:58] <ivankuzev> .....it wont
[03:00:13] <faraway> Crucials: or  selectElement.find(":selected");
[03:00:46] <ivankuzev> ....if you try $(select).find(option:selected) it might
[03:01:22] <faraway> ivankuzev: why do you think my example would not work ?
[03:02:02] <ivankuzev> but if you want to get the value of a selected element you can just use .val()
[03:02:57] <Crucials> Basically I have this jquery color picker plugin. I want to set many different elements to the .ColorPicker() method. But when I click each element, an appropriate one should be recolored
[03:03:04] <ivankuzev> i think that the select element doesnt get :selected
[03:03:10] <ivankuzev> the option does
[03:03:35] <Koopz> good point
[03:04:18] <faraway> ivankuzev: always the option element gets the :selected attribute
[03:05:51] <Koopz> the more i search for a way to let my code wait for the event i trigger()ed, the more i get pissed...
[03:06:18] <NodeX> what's the problem?
[03:07:26] <ivankuzev> koopz...yeah can you give us an example of what you need....i may have missed something
[03:08:55] <Koopz> there is a select box... i choose a value and request a list of options for another select box
[03:09:15] <ivankuzev> so far nothing complicated
[03:09:46] <Koopz> after the list has been requested, i trigger the change-event on it to get it formatted
[03:10:07] <Koopz> then i want to set the default-value i get requested too
[03:10:41] <Koopz> the problem is the value is set before the triggered event is finished and gets overwritten
[03:11:13] <NodeX> pastebin / fiddle your code
[03:12:24] <ivankuzev> will it work if you format it after your request is finished?
[03:13:24] <Koopz> nah the format-thing is setting the value too
[03:13:32] <Koopz> thats the problem
[03:14:32] <joesavage> Anyone know of any jQuery solutions (or easy home-made scripts) that could easily perform a client-side search of an XML sitemap? I've got a static, Jekyll-esque, site and need to provide search functionality
[03:15:55] <Koopz> stuff is getting called from multiple positions so turning off the setting of the variable in the formatting-thing isnt an option...
[03:17:11] <Koopz> let me see if i can get that bunch of code converted to an example...
[03:17:39] <ivankuzev> yeah i eat fiddles :)
[03:19:00] <astropirate> :o its ivankuzev!!
[03:19:00] <astropirate> hey ivan
[03:19:00] <ivankuzev> one time i start irc...and you are here......:)
[03:19:02] <ivankuzev> hello
[03:19:15] <astropirate> haha
[03:19:18] <astropirate> i'm always on irc
[03:23:28] <ivankuzev> did i miss somethin
[03:24:25] <astropirate> nope
[03:25:05] <test> hi
[03:25:12] <ivankuzev> hi test
[03:25:29] <test> hello
[03:25:42] <test> so this works
[03:25:55] <Koopz> do you need a working example?
[03:26:19] <Koopz> because ajax...
[03:26:29] <ivankuzev> well if you need help its preferable...but  not neceseary
[03:26:47] <ivankuzev> i can try to sort it out with what you have
[03:28:02] <xzpp> how can i use jquery ui 1.8.16 on a page that has jquery 1.2.6 "imported"?
[03:28:39] <ivankuzev> make it to have higler version of jquery
[03:28:39] <Hardeep> Hi
[03:28:55] <xzpp> ivankuzev: no can do
[03:29:22] <xzpp> the 1.2.6 version has to be on the default namespace etc.
[03:29:24] <xzpp> can't get rid of it
[03:29:25] <xzpp> either
[03:29:33] <Hardeep> how do i call store procedure using only jquery ?
[03:29:53] <xzpp> on a scale from 1 to 10 how fuuucked am i?
[03:29:59] <joesavage> Anyone got any help on my XML parsing/search issue? Pre-existing jQuery solutions to the problem would be most helpful if possible
[03:31:54] <Kingsy> anyone in here use anythingSlider ?
[03:34:26] <letweet> how can I run a function every time my text input's text value is changed?
[03:36:32] <mindis|wurk> depends on the change. you can use .change() for some events like the content changing and focus moving elsewhere, but if you want to monitor what the user is typing then you should look into keyup and keydown events
[03:37:04] <letweet> I just want to make sure that the text is not empty
[03:37:34] <faraway> letweet: then you probably should check on blur if it is empty
[03:37:50] <mindis|wurk> i would assume it would be best to check for that right before submitting the info and then requesting input from the user to fix it
[03:38:44] <faraway> letweet: otherwise you should listen to  keypress if you want to give immediate response while typing
[03:40:51] <letweet> faraway, .keyPress() ?
[03:41:26] <NodeX> $('body').on('blur','.your-class',function(){ var element=$(this); if(element.val().length<=0) { alert('Value cannot be empty'); } };
[03:41:42] <NodeX> or something along those lines
[03:41:44] <mindis|wurk> i would definitely advise against that kind of solution
[03:41:53] <mindis|wurk> it's not very user friendly
[03:42:02] <faraway> letweet: i prefer $(…).on("keypress", ….);
[03:42:36] <faraway> letweet: cause then you could change to  $(…).on("keypress keyup blur change", ….); if needed
[03:42:37] <NodeX> keypress inside an element will mostly make it not empty
[03:42:58] <NodeX> (apart from tab / enter)
[03:43:17] <faraway> NodeX: or the delete key ;)
[03:43:22] <NodeX> or that
[03:43:29] <NodeX> hence the "mostly"
[03:43:47] <NodeX> ergo it fires alot for no reason ... better to check on blur
[03:44:22] <faraway> thats what i sated before, for immediate response keypress, otherwise blur would be better
[03:44:26] <letweet> okay, think it might help if I explained what I want to do...
[03:44:31] <mindis|wurk> in any case using an alert for announcing it is baaaad
[03:44:43] <NodeX> mindis|wurk : it was an example
[03:44:54] <NodeX> I would never advocate using alert() to tell a user somehting
[03:45:04] <faraway> keyup would not work if user has text caret at the and and holds the delete key pressed
[03:45:07] <NodeX> [11:41:34] <NodeX> or something along those lines
[03:45:11] <faraway> eh keydown
[03:45:12] <mindis|wurk> i would
[03:45:13] <NodeX> hence the "something along those lines"
[03:45:30] <faraway> letweet: that always helps :D
[03:45:40] <letweet> basically, the form sends email out to all the users in the database, but I'm adding "test email" functionality that should send just 1 email to the specified email address... So, I want to disable the "main send" button if the test send textbox is not empty
[03:46:35] <NodeX> start the form with the button disabled and enable it on keypress (if the value.length > N
[03:46:35] <faraway> letweet: ah ok, so blur won't work cause the user could click on the "main send" before the input filed blurs
[03:47:05] <NodeX> faraway : I think the blur fires before the submit in that case
[03:47:22] <NodeX> it's higher in the event chain
[03:47:31] <faraway> NodeX: yes just form usability point of view
[03:47:56] <NodeX> eh?
[03:48:38] <NodeX> letweet : I would check the value on submit personaly
[03:48:43] <NodeX> easiest way
[03:50:36] <Jennifer23> hi image_add_html is a string of html like <li><img src=""></li> etc, i need to add it via, this code, how do i do that, it required an object field.insertAfter(image_add_html, jQuery(this).closest('div'))
[03:51:37] <NodeX> jQuery(this).closest('div').insertAfter(image_add_html);
[03:51:57] <faraway> NodeX: short scenario, button "main send" is enabled, user starts to type something in the input filed (so button will get disabled on blur) then user clicks on the button, the button gets disable right at that moment, thats not really nice. same the other way round. user deletes the content of the filed, button is still disable until the input field gets blur event. that what i tired to say.
[03:52:24] <NodeX> which is what I have already said
[03:52:32] <NodeX> [11:46:27] <NodeX> start the form with the button disabled and enable it on keypress (if the value.length > N <------------------
[03:53:35] <Jennifer23> NodeX: i need to add it with field, which is field = jQuery(this).closest('div').find('.custom_image li:last').clone(true);
[03:53:52] <NodeX> there is nothing wrong with doing it on submit - and it's less computation
[03:54:05] <Jennifer23> so changing it to this completely removes the parent element
[03:54:24] <NodeX> jQuery(this).closest('div').find('.custom_image li:last').clone(true).insertAfter(image_add_html);
[03:55:57] <mindis|wurk> what a nasty line that would be :D
[03:56:04] <faraway> NodeX: that message of you appeared just at the moment i send the other one .. so i could not read … probably internet is a bit slow here right now
[03:57:06] <EnginA> looks like the ideal way of cross site requests is still jsonp ?
[03:58:29] <NodeX> or a proxy
[04:02:57] <makin> Hi people, How I can split a string in the first whitespace? For example: string = "HI DAD"; Result ="HI";
[04:07:03] <masak> curious question: in jQuery, why is it .val() and not .value(), like the name of the HTML 4.01 <input> attribute?
[04:07:04] <ravenzz> str.substring(0, str.indexOf(" "));
[04:07:12] <ravenzz> makin ^
[04:08:14] <makin> ravenzz thx! I think that there is an other solution: .match(/[^\s-]+-?/g)[0];
[04:08:28] <ravenzz> or str.split(" ")[0]
[04:09:05] <ravenzz> you can use a regex as well
[04:09:42] <mindis|wurk> masak if i had to hazard a guess i would say it's to prevent it from getting confused with value() in javascript
[04:11:54] <masak> hm. what does value() do in JavaScript?
[04:12:14] <ravenzz> value
[04:12:23] <ravenzz> without ()
[04:12:36] <masak> ok.
[04:13:06] <masak> what is it used for? and why would it clash with .value slots on jQuery objects?
[04:14:06] <sahbeewah> a jquery object is just a javascript function
[04:14:35] <ravenzz> it won't clash, it can confuse
[04:14:46] <mindis|wurk> val() automates a lot of irritating stuff like retrieving the current option value of a select element
[04:15:18] <ravenzz> value is a property val() a function
[04:17:37] <gabriel1> jesus
[04:17:40] <gabriel1> I dont get this
[04:18:40] <gabriel1> I have a multidimensional array on my serverside(php) I want from JQuery make an ajax request to get this array but I have a MVC structure so I dont really want to ask a differentfile then my controller
[04:19:05] <gabriel1> can I put my controller.php as the url ?
[04:19:09] <gabriel1> in my ajax request?
[04:19:12] <zatan> hey I am calling $.get, and getting  data as (" $(function () {   $(document).ready(function() ...") and trying to append in body but I am getting raw html why ?
[04:19:14] <ravenzz> no?!
[04:19:36] <EnginA> NodeX: proxy ? as in iframe hack ?
[04:19:42] <ravenzz> gabriel1 you should create a route to a method in that controller
[04:20:12] <ravenzz> what framework are you working with?
[04:21:34] <CodeFriar> Morning.
[04:22:10] <CodeFriar> I have a select box that is being populated by ajax. What event trigger can I use to fire off a sort method when the select box is done populating ?
[04:22:39] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: just do it on the ajax callback
[04:23:06] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: oh if only it were that easy. I don't control that ajax call.
[04:23:19] <hooloovoo> but you do know when it's done, don't you?
[04:23:23] <gabriel1> ravenzz: we are not really using a framework
[04:23:31] <gabriel1> but taking bits and pieces of zend
[04:23:36] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: only visually
[04:23:37] <mindis|wurk> argh zend :D
[04:23:44] <gabriel1> yeah...
[04:23:44] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: well, the spinner disapears
[04:24:03] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: ummmm... so where is the ajax call done?
[04:24:09] <mindis|wurk> i like the support you get from the zend channel though. "do it yourself"
[04:24:28] <gabriel1> hehe
[04:24:29] <mindis|wurk> a very opensourcy answer i might say
[04:24:34] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: I'm trying to alphabatize a list of names that come back from a third party plugin into jira.
[04:24:41] <CodeFriar> the plugin makes the ajax call
[04:24:54] <hooloovoo> mindis|wurk: best thing is to stay away from php =P
[04:25:17] <ravenzz> gabriel1 oh well, I am not familiar with Zend, but that is the idea
[04:25:19] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: does that plugin have any documentation?
[04:25:29] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: none. it's closed source
[04:25:44] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: but... no documentation at all?
[04:25:45] <gabriel1> i will google routed
[04:25:51] <gabriel1> thanks for directions thou
[04:25:52] <gabriel1> cheers
[04:25:52] <CodeFriar> i know the name of the method that's being called to populate that select box but other than that, nothing
[04:26:00] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: ow well... i guess you'd have to do some ugly hack in that case.
[04:26:05] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: yeah, it's a terrible plugin but it's the best out there.
[04:26:23] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: like check if the option element count has changed with a interval or something
[04:26:27] <hooloovoo> and sort it then
[04:26:41] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: sounds shitty. can't you make your own plugin?
[04:27:02] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: plugin ties jira and salesforce together
[04:27:30] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: that's not a answer =P
[04:27:38] <ravenzz> gabriel1 the idea is that you define a route /foo/bar and assign to it a name/placeholder say foo_bar, so you use foo_bar in your ajax setup
[04:27:40] <CodeFriar> hooloovoo: no, not really
[04:27:56] <hooloovoo> CodeFriar: ask the creators of the plugin if they know how to do it.
[04:27:57] <ravenzz> and /foo/bar can change at any time
[04:28:16] <hooloovoo> the right way to do it is to sort it on the request callback
[04:28:22] <hooloovoo> they should add a event for that
[04:28:27] <Kingsy> does anyone know what "easing" means in relation to sliders?
[04:28:36] <EnginA> looks like i need to modify my server to return jsonp too... now it only returns json
[04:28:41] <Kingsy> apprently there is an "easing plugin" .. ?
[04:28:42] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: yup... hmmm...
[04:28:50] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: it's like... you can get a bounce effect
[04:28:53] <hooloovoo> or swing
[04:28:55] <EnginA> it is very useful for third party apps but ... browsers are restricted by same origin policty
[04:29:06] <hooloovoo> alter the animation speed at different times
[04:29:10] <Kingsy> hooloovoo: what would it mean in regards to a slider using a fade effect?
[04:29:23] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: alter the opacity according to a curve
[04:29:27] <freazy> hi, $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container'); load me the entire page. why?
[04:29:51] <Kingsy> hooloovoo: hmm so it wouldnt change it fading totally out then totally back in? rather than from one to another?
[04:30:16] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: no, it'll just change the transition itself, not the end result
[04:30:38] <Kingsy> ah ok..
[04:31:04] <Kingsy> damn.. I need it to fade all the way out then back in
[04:31:10] <Kingsy> not transition from one to another :S
[04:31:24] <hooloovoo> then you fadeout
[04:31:26] <hooloovoo> then fadein
[04:31:35] <hooloovoo> on the callback of fadeout that is
[04:31:38] <Kingsy> hooloovoo: I am using anythingSlider
[04:31:45] <Kingsy> the effects are just built in
[04:31:51] <hooloovoo> i hate that plugin =(
[04:31:54] <Kingsy> heh
[04:32:02] <hooloovoo> just choose linear if you don't want it
[04:32:04] <Kingsy> it seems to work well apart from this
[04:32:23] <Kingsy> hooloovoo: linear easing? you said the easing doesnt matter
[04:32:45] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: linear easing is... well linear. it's like not having a easing
[04:33:09] <Kingsy> yep.. I set the easing to that.. and the fade is still a transition.. not out then in
[04:33:11] <hooloovoo> it shouldn't affect what you're trying to do tho
[04:33:18] <Kingsy> yup :S
[04:33:39] <gabriel1> oh jesus, can you put a json_encoded array into a hidden input?!
[04:33:44] <gabriel1> please tell me so
[04:34:03] <hooloovoo> Kingsy: if you want it to fade out then back in you could probably use a homemade easing, but it's stupid. fade it back in on the success callback of fadeout
[04:34:44] <hooloovoo> like this $("#el").animate({ "opacity": 0 }, function() { $("#el").animate({ "opacity": 1 }) });
[04:35:19] <Kingsy> you couldnt encorperate that into the slider tho
[04:35:56] <hooloovoo> i have no idea how to do any of this on the slider. i used it for 2 minutes before i made my own instead.
[04:36:06] <Kingsy> yeah np
[04:36:17] <freazy> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container'); load me the entire page. is that correct?
[04:38:04] <granden> Hi, anyone here who uses jCrop?
[04:38:15] <granden> Wonder if it is possible to add some sort of zoom-effect for it.
[04:38:44] <hooloovoo> granden: i used to
[04:39:18] <hooloovoo> granden: iirc jcrop is only the cropping effect with the added bonus of getting coordinates for the marked area.
[04:39:43] <hooloovoo> granden: so no, it's not that easy but it's not impossible! =)
[04:39:43] <aburrabeet> @freazy it will load the ajax/test.html and will extract #container element from the page and then set into #result element.
[04:40:08] <masak> so, both .live() and .delegate() have been superseded by .on(), yes?
[04:40:21] <masak> what was the difference between them? I don't quite understand this from the documentation.
[04:40:40] <hooloovoo> masak: .live had the events bound to document
[04:40:42] <freazy> @aburrabeet yes, that would be nice, but it loads the entire page with html scripts and all the stuff
[04:40:54] <hooloovoo> masak: while you could say where you wanted the event bound in .delegate
[04:41:03] <masak> hooloovoo: ah, so you could emulate .live with .delegate?
[04:41:10] <hooloovoo> masak: yup! =)
[04:41:14] <masak> gotcha. thanks.
[04:41:18] <hooloovoo> masak: and now you can do the same thing with on =)
[04:41:24] <masak> yay \o/
[04:41:42] <hooloovoo> yea it's awesome. soo many ways of doing the exact same thing ^^^
[04:41:54] <masak> I think jQuery is my favorite API of all time.
[04:41:58] <masak> and it just keeps getting better \o/
[04:42:30] <mindis|wurk> it does make js almost bearable
[04:42:39] <hooloovoo> almost
[04:43:27] <masak> js... has good parts :)
[04:43:43] <aburrabeet> @freazy Yes that is true. But every thing out of #continer wrapper will be stripped out.
[04:43:55] <mindis|wurk> not really. unless you compare them to some ancient language that requires libs for strings etc.
[04:43:58] <granden> hooloovoo: Ok, I would only wanna be able to zoom the object if it is a really hi res image.
[04:44:15] <granden> so I could do a more accurate cropping.
[04:44:33] <hooloovoo> granden: it's still just as difficult =P
[04:44:49] <hooloovoo> granden: i'd suggest using some plugin that uses canvas instead of jcrop
[04:45:00] <hooloovoo> granden: it'll most likely already have zooming and cropping
[04:45:52] <hooloovoo> mindis|wurk: well, it's not as bad as php =D
[04:46:00] <freazy> @aburrabeet but should my response contain only the <div id="container">content...</div>?
[04:46:30] <mindis|wurk> hooloovoo i'd say it's a lot worse
[04:46:35] <aburrabeet> @freazy Yes
[04:46:45] <freazy> but its not
[04:47:05] <zatan> hye is there anyway to get a DOM element from which one script is called ?
[04:47:10] <hooloovoo> mindis|wurk: i wouldn't agree. js isn't pretty, but php is reeeeeeeally horrific.
[04:47:21] <hooloovoo> (with some exceptions)
[04:48:18] <freazy> @alburrabeet it contains <!doctype html>.....
[04:48:48] <sokmar> hi, is there a good way to emulate a radio buttonset with an anchor buttonset? if I give one of the anchors ui-state-active, the class gets removed on hover
[04:52:14] <aburrabeet> @freazy Check your browser js/console if you are getting any error?
[04:52:56] <freazy> no i pretty sure the code is correct...firebug shows up no error or something
[04:54:02] <granden> hooloovoo: Any recommendations for plugin that could do it?
[04:54:20] <hooloovoo> granden: nah sorry, you'd have to look around. i don't have time atm. =(
[04:55:19] <freazy> @aburrabeet i fount the solution its the browser... firefox 14 cant handle the command
[04:55:42] <freazy> in safari or earlier versions of firefox all work fine
[04:55:57] <mindis|wurk> wut
[04:56:05] <freazy> @aburrabeet thanks for help
[04:56:30] <aburrabeet> @freazy you save my time :) thank you. I was also trying out in FF14.
[04:56:44] <freazy> :)
[04:58:56] <ximarin> hi all, is someone here familiar with styling jquery dataTables?
[04:59:28] <ximarin> I can't get the wrapper to NOT take 100% width of the viewport, how do I tell it to just take the width it needs?
[04:59:48] <Luffha> hi guys....how do i replace "http://www.mysite.com/image.jpg" with <img src="http://www.mysite.com/image.jpg" /> ?
[05:01:04] <Luffha> i mean find all image links inside an ID, and replace them with viewable pics?
[05:16:35] <ivankuzev> no one chats here anymore?
[05:17:30] <aburrabeet> @ivankuzev guys would be busy :)
[05:17:36] <frankstallone> ivankuzev: I am reviewing code from one of our distributors, what are you up to? =)
[05:18:06] <ivankuzev> trying to find problems
[05:18:51] <Koopz> "theres got to be bug somewhere...SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!"
[05:19:09] <frankstallone> ivankuzev: problem, solver eh?
[05:19:24] <frankstallone> I could show you my code, I am sure you could find all sorts of inefficiencies
[05:19:25] <frankstallone> lol
[05:19:34] * frankstallone n00b @ jQuery
[05:19:47] * frankstallone well versed in HTML & CSS
[05:19:49] <luke--> hi
[05:19:50] <ivankuzev> lol.
[05:20:16] <frankstallone> Hi luke--
[05:20:21] <frankstallone> hello WORLD!
[05:21:04] <ivankuzev> and the world says error, bad command or file name
[05:21:49] <luke--> is there a function like prevAll('.selector') that will only return previous elements with .selector until the prev element does not have the class .selector anymore?
[05:22:01] <frankstallone> lol @ ivankuzev
[05:23:19] <frankstallone> previous elements with .selector... so like if there is a list with the same li.class-name?
[05:23:23] <ivankuzev> @luke i think it will return all previus elements that match(selector)
[05:23:35] <luke--> I know but I need this:
[05:23:42] <luke--> like if I have  <div class="selector" /> <div class="NOTselector" /> <div class="selector" /> <div class="selector" /> <div id="foo" /> and I do $('#foo').prevAll('.selector') it will only return the 2 direct .selector elements
[05:23:53] <luke--> is there a function for this?
[05:24:14] <ivankuzev> well it will do that
[05:26:50] <luke--> ivankuzev: no it will return all .selector elements, even the one before .NOTselector
[05:27:28] <ivankuzev> oh....sorry didnt see one of the ones after selector
[05:28:13] <ivankuzev> damn it.hate when that hapens
[05:28:32] <luke--> I think I got it: $('#foo').prevUntil(':not(.selector)')
[05:28:33] <frankstallone> ivankuzev: PROBLEM? :: looks for solution :: lol
[05:29:24] <smykes> SQL Server is down, I get to go home right?
[05:51:45] <AxonetBE> if this is my html <option value="diesel" data-target="/products/femme/diesel">Diesel</option>, how I can get the data-target value then?
[05:52:31] <AxonetBE> I have an onchange on the select and I tried to use $(this).data('target') but it is undefined, also $(this).attr('data-target') is undefined
[05:52:49] <AxonetBE> $(this).attr('value') works perfect
[05:52:54] <ajpiano> $(this).data("target") or $(this).attr("data-target")
[05:53:00] <ajpiano> assuming this === the option
[05:53:20] <ajpiano> AxonetBE: $(this).find("option:selected").data("target")
[05:55:29] <AxonetBE> ajpiano: but this must also work no? https://gist.github.com/gists/3216876 but always returns undefined
[05:56:07] <ajpiano> AxonetBE: a select is not the same thing as the selected option in the select
[05:56:24] <ivankuzev> axonetbe: try $(this).find(":selected").data("target")
[05:56:42] <AxonetBE> ivankuzev: in the function ?
[05:56:45] <ajpiano> AxonetBE: if my favourite colour is green, and you ask my dad what his favourite colour is, he's not gonna tell you my answer
[05:56:47] <ajpiano> that's the same thing i said
[05:56:52] <ivankuzev> in the change handler
[05:57:52] <AxonetBE> ok thanks
[05:58:00] <ivankuzev> correnction....you better use children instead of find
[05:58:10] <ajpiano> why, pray tell
[05:58:51] <ajpiano> options can have <optgroup>s and in no way will .find be materially slower than .children
[05:58:59] <ajpiano> especially if there only are direct children to begin with
[05:59:23] <lathan> ?hi
[05:59:27] <ivankuzev> oh sorry didnt know

[06:11:24] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Putting the finishing touches on jQuery Mobile 1.2 alpha now…releasing very soon. ★ http://bit.ly/OznkgT
[06:12:30] <DireFog> I'm trying to PUT some data to the server, and have the whole thing act like a regular client request, so basically "a link that PUTs stuff". Somehow my websearch-fu is failing, any pointers?
[06:13:06] <ansolas> using which server side technology ?
[06:13:16] <comet`> hi there
[06:13:23] <ansolas> hello
[06:13:51] <DireFog> ansolas: Rails, but that doesn't really matter for now
[06:15:10] <comet`> I am trying to load an image asyncrously, and then resize it to fit its parent, and fadeIn() when its load event triggers. I have http://jsfiddle.net/tSbkJ/4/ which works for all save some images with a similar width to height ratio as the parent.
[06:15:10] <DireFog> my failure to do things is entirely client-side :-)
[06:15:15] <comet`> any ideas?
[06:16:21] <blackspotwiggins> DireFog, method: "put" should be enough for straight up links
[06:17:49] <ivankuzev> comet`:what happens then?
[06:17:59] <DireFog> blackspotwiggins: I somehow need to attach a bunch of data (JSON in this case) to the request though
[06:18:39] <comet`> ivankuzev: well, it should resize the largest dimension of the image, to fit inside the parent
[06:18:55] <comet`> but sometimes it resizes the wrong dimension
[06:19:09] <comet`> and spills over the edges
[06:19:12] <DireFog> I have the data, all I'd need is a way to somehow send it to the server and have the entire process act like a regular link of form submission, and possibly without replacing the window content with the server response
[06:19:30] <DireFog> … manually
[06:19:51] <comet`> the problem is with how I am checking for the largest dimension, but I really can't think of any other way to do it
[06:20:01] <ansolas> wont just a simpel ajax post work ?
[06:21:05] <faraway> hi, i once saw a library that combined ttouch events and mouse event to on single event class (pointer events or something like this) but i cannot find it anymore. does anyone know such a plugin/library for query ?
[06:21:16] <ivankuzev> comet`: first  //why doesn't $(this).width() or $(this).height() work?
[06:21:16] <ivankuzev>             
[06:21:40] <ivankuzev> well it wont work untill the image is actually loaded
[06:22:14] <ivankuzev> i reccoment putting the whole thing in an onLoad event
[06:22:23] <comet`> ivankuzev: exactly, but being within a callback from the load event, it should be fully loaded, no?
[06:22:38] <comet`> is it not already within a load event?
[06:23:15] <ivankuzev> nope
[06:24:14] <ivankuzev> all images are loaded asynchroniusly...and cuyrently you only set the src...its not loaded
[06:24:41] <hooloovoo> comet`: comet` http://jsfiddle.net/tSbkJ/5/
[06:24:46] <hooloovoo> comet`: check the console =)
[06:28:06] <faraway> never mind .. found it again :D
[06:29:01] <comet`> hooloovoo: that just displays it
[06:29:27] <comet`> i made a mistake typing it in to jsfiddle
[06:29:39] <comet`> that is the wy I had it on my own copy
[06:29:59] <comet`> the latter way of course
[06:30:42] <ivankuzev> comet`:oh and the ofsets are calculated well you shoud use division(/) not addition(+)http://jsfiddle.net/tSbkJ/7/
[06:31:29] <comet`> but ivankuzev """(from .load() documentation;) This method is a shortcut for .bind('load', handler).  The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded."""
[06:32:31] <ivankuzev> my mistake there probably
[06:33:35] <comet`> still doesn't explain why i have to use this.width, rather than $(this).width();
[06:36:09] <comet`> ivankuzev: using division worked, I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier
[06:36:42] <comet`> thanks
[06:37:13] <makin> Hi people, I have a text input to write a phone number. I want to put a whitespace every 3 characters. Example: 634545477 result: 634 545 477

[06:38:11] <ivankuzev> makin:ok ok...wait a secon
[06:38:12] <makin> while the user writeñ.
[06:40:01] <ivankuzev> makin:i think you can use .keypress() to bind a function that rearranges the spaces every time the use types a nunmber\
[06:40:32] <ivankuzev> and yell at him/her if he tries to type letters
[06:45:01] <nagaraj> hi
[06:45:08] <ivankuzev> hello
[06:45:18] <nagaraj> I am new to jquery
[06:45:29] <ivankuzev> we all were at some point
[06:45:42] <nagaraj>  :)
[06:46:14] <nagaraj> do I need to know CSS well before learning jQuery?
[06:47:24] <nagaraj> do I need to know CSS  before learning jQuery?
[06:47:25] <ivankuzev> it helps
[06:47:48] <nagaraj> I know basics of CSS not a master
[06:47:53] <nagaraj> is it ok?
[06:48:10] <ivankuzev> you shoud be ok
[06:48:29] <nagaraj> thank you!
[06:50:50] <nagaraj> thanx to ivankuzev
[06:51:17] <Simplyy> hello you cunts
[06:51:25] <Simplyy> how is your cancer treatment going?
[06:52:35] <faraway> nagaraj: not sure if it is to much info to start with but this is a nice presentation about common mistakes people could do when they use jquery http://www.elijahmanor.com/
[06:58:27] <Gates> is there a lightbox like popup that works cross browsers and mobile?
[07:00:09] <faraway> Gates: for images only ?
[07:00:18] <Gates> it will be a video
[07:00:23] <Gates> and buttons under
[07:03:56] <Gates> faraway: like mixed content
[07:04:34] <faraway> hmmm … sorry then one i remembered is only for image without buttons sorry
[07:04:38] <lathan> Gates, like jQuery UI dialog?
[07:04:54] <Gates> just like a popup on top the website
[07:05:00] <Gates> on first load
[07:05:12] <lathan> jQuery UI's dialog could be configured to be like that
[07:05:21] <lathan> Gates: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[07:05:21] <Gates> and work everywhere?
[07:05:30] <cambazz> hello, one of the functions i wrote will not work in IE7, and i dont know why. it wont work in IE7, sometimes.
[07:05:33] <lathan> Gates, let the jQuery UI team make sure its standard
[07:05:45] <lathan> cambazz, a lot of stuff doesn't work in IE7. IE is picky
[07:05:53] <Gates> i see what u did there
[07:05:56] <Gates> and you can restyle it?
[07:06:01] <Gates> to just be a empty box
[07:06:13] <gabriel1> Guys, perhaps a weird question. I think I got my ajax callback to work but I get this: http://pastebin.com/86Vr0G2G
[07:06:21] <gabriel1> I expect an array
[07:06:29] <lathan> Gates, that's all CSS. there demo has their default CSS, but you can make your own
[07:06:41] <gabriel1> and that can be an array but in a weird form, how can I loop thru this? :s
[07:07:12] <danzik17> gabriel1: don't.  fix your return value to be an array if you want an array.
[07:07:13] <ivankuzev> its a json
[07:07:39] <ivankuzev> use $.parseJSON(data) to convert it to object
[07:07:52] <gabriel1> Thats what I missed...
[07:08:01] <gabriel1> ivankuzev: cheers!
[07:08:31] <gabriel1> danzik17: I appriciate that you helped as well.
[07:09:17] <gabriel1> oh, can I: var myArr = $.parseJSON(data); ?
[07:09:24] <ivankuzev> yes
[07:09:24] <gabriel1> and then loop thru myArr?
[07:09:30] <gabriel1> spot on!
[07:09:33] <gabriel1> thanks!
[07:09:59] <cambazz> hello, I put the code in http://pastebin.ca/2176141
[07:10:17] <cambazz> can someone look over it and produce any idea why it might fail in IE7
[07:10:57] <ivankuzev> the loop shoud be for(var a in b)......standart for(var i;i<myArr.length;i++) wont work...
[07:12:43] <faraway> cambazz: what is the error you get ?
[07:12:54] <makin> ivankuzev but how I can concat a whitespace into a val of the input?
[07:13:47] <faraway> cambazz: i think in IE 7 JSON.stringify  does not exist
[07:13:50] <gabriel1> ah ok, thanks for that tip ivankuzev
[07:14:28] <cambazz> faraway: i dont know what error it gives. i am setting up a virtual box with IE7 at the moment.
[07:14:28] <gabriel1> another pop, isnt JSON playing well with non-ascii characters ?
[07:14:34] <gabriel1> like åäö ?
[07:14:42] <cambazz> but I also suspect, JSON.stringfy does not exist too
[07:14:59] <ivankuzev> well it works well for me when i use cyrilic
[07:15:13] <cambazz> the thing is i was using json_sans_eval_1.js - and I thought JSON.stringify is a part of that
[07:15:15] <gabriel1> hmm, in that case, I must have some kind of bug somewhere else
[07:17:05] <faraway> cambazz: you sure that this provides  JSON.stringify if i remember right it has only a jsonParse function
[07:17:38] <faraway> cambazz: you you include this https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js  just to see if it then works
[07:18:33] <shoky> yea json_sans_eval is only a parser
[07:19:09] <ivankuzev> gabriel1: good luck finding it
[07:19:16] <Whirl3d> cambazz, you will probably want to be using .map
[07:19:35] <bastetmilo> Hi, how to prevent action that is made by some script (that I cant find and turn off, because I cant find id :)) when user is typing in input field?
[07:20:46] <boulet101010> how to prevent bubbling on a click event like this : http://jsfiddle.net/pDky2/
[07:21:07] <ablomen> boulet101010, http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:22:33] <gyzmodo> guys
[07:22:50] <gyzmodo> how to remove input value when user starts typing?
[07:23:11] <ivankuzev> focus(function(){})
[07:23:33] <ivankuzev> thats when use clicks.......actually not very useful
[07:23:47] <boulet101010> ty ablomen
[07:24:53] <ivankuzev> gyzmodo: you can use  the .keypress() to set a function to do what you want when user presses a key
[07:25:57] <Whirl3d> gyzmodo, if you are using html5, you should check out the placeholder attribute, it may be what you are looking for.
[07:28:53] <LindsayMac> is there a function in this room to tell a nick something next time they return?
[07:29:08] <shoky> only when a bot is around
[07:29:56] <gabriel1> when taking an array from $.parseJSON(data) and loop thru it with: for (var a in dataArray), can I somehow do a loop that can fetch both key and value?
[07:30:23] <shoky> gabriel1:  a is the key, dataArray[a] is the value
[07:30:23] <gyzmodo> Whirl3d, i am using placeholder and autofocus
[07:30:23] <ivankuzev> a is the key
[07:30:34] <gabriel1> oooohh
[07:30:42] <shoky> gabriel1: and you should probably use $.each instead of making your own loop
[07:30:44] <ivankuzev> well shoky beat me
[07:31:00] <gyzmodo> but in all browsers except Chrome doestn work like a charm
[07:31:05] <danzik17> gabriel1: what you have is not an array, it's an object.  and for-in does not guarantee the order in which it iterates properties, so that's probably not the right way to do what you're trying to do.
[07:31:15] <gyzmodo> if you use autofocus it removes placeholder
[07:31:17] <gyzmodo> ;(
[07:31:47] <gabriel1> danzik17: that is complete ok, Im not dependent on getting the value by any order, I will sort them accordingly later on
[07:31:55] <gabriel1> but thanks for the heads up
[07:31:56] <LindsayMac> shoky:  how do you know when a bot is around
[07:31:57] <gabriel1> appriciate
[07:32:01] <gabriel1> it
[07:32:02] <LindsayMac> `hello
[07:32:11] <shoky> LindsayMac: bot-t is the main bot here
[07:32:16] <gabriel1> thanks guys
[07:32:22] <shoky> LindsayMac: lately there's been an annoying bo-t  or something too
[07:32:39] <LindsayMac> how does a bot come in and out? I always thought a bot was always on in a room
[07:32:58] <shoky> a bot is a program running on some computer connected to irc
[07:33:03] <shoky> it can disconnect
[07:33:10] <blackspotwiggins> LindsayMac, it occasionally dies
[07:33:14] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe is killed due to spam
[07:33:14] <LindsayMac> like in #wordpress they have doc-bot which is an AWESOME little bot and it's commands work like .tell nick something for later
[07:33:19] <LindsayMac> aw that's sad
[07:33:44] <LindsayMac> they should figure out how to spam the person using the bot in a spammy way instead of the bot itself...
[07:33:59] <LindsayMac> wordpress has it's bot script available.. its open source
[07:34:05] <shoky> their connection is just crap
[07:34:09] <seutje> I miss tempsy :(
[07:34:17] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, we all do :(
[07:34:30] <LindsayMac> is there a page with all the bot commands somewhere?
[07:34:35] <seutje> b-ot: tell b-ot it's just not the same :(
[07:34:37] <ajpiano> shoky: lathan LindsayMac bot-t is made by temp01 and no one else but him has control of it, and he doesn't talk on IRC anymore
[07:34:42] <ajpiano> so bot-t just comes and goes with the connection
[07:34:52] <seutje> and it hates me, apparently
[07:35:00] <ajpiano> a few people are working on b-ot as a replacement but it's a gradual process, and has bugs still
[07:35:12] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, what happened to temp01 ?
[07:36:02] <ajpiano> i donno
[07:36:06] <ajpiano> he's very secretive
[07:36:20] <lathan> planning on taking over the world, perhaps?
[07:36:22] <seutje> now there's an understatement
[07:36:28] <blackspotwiggins> hope he does not end up like _why
[07:36:39] <seutje> pretty sure the world would already have been his if he wanted it
[07:36:45] <lathan> lol
[07:45:42] <geekluc> Hello
[07:45:48] <geekluc> I have a problem
[07:47:17] <geekluc> how can I prohibit the right click of the mouse?
[07:47:30] <Whirl3d> superglue
[07:48:17] <NoiseEee> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+can+I+prohibit+the+right+click+of+the+mouse%3F
[07:48:18] <hlveheart> lol
[07:48:26] <Guilherme> geekluc, http://www.devcurry.com/2009/11/disable-right-click-easily-using-jquery.html
[07:48:37] <hlveheart> <Whirl3d> superglue
[07:48:38] <hlveheart> lol
[07:49:10] <geekluc> my case is more problematic
[07:49:25] <geekluc> I want to ban the right in a specific div
[07:49:39] <gkatsev> does jquery have something like a mutation event listener? Or it wont work unless the browser supports DOM MutationEvent or MutationObserver?
[07:49:40] <geekluc> and the span was added dynamically by jquery
[07:49:45] <Whirl3d> I didn't think Mac Users were allowed to use right click at all. Didn't Steve Jobs decide for y'all that more than one button on a mouse was tooo much to handle?
[07:50:06] <geekluc> so I can not select this div dynamically added
[07:50:11] <Whirl3d> MutationEvent sounds creepy! I love it.
[07:50:18] <gkatsev> lol
[07:50:59] <johnkpaul> gkatsev: there is a jquery plugin that uses timeouts to simulate it
[07:51:10] <johnkpaul> but I'd reconsider your need for that behavior
[07:51:12] <johnkpaul> because it's a pain
[07:51:23] <Whirl3d> wait, wait. What is it? Hey johnkpaul...
[07:51:44] <johnkpaul> it's in the innerds of livequery I believe
[07:51:45] <gkatsev> johnkpaul: thanks, and yeah, I dont *really* need one.
[07:51:46] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/thomaspeklak/jquery-livequery
[07:51:51] <geekluc> I want to ban the right in a specific div.  and the div was added dynamically by jquery. so I can not select this div dynamically added
[07:52:00] <johnkpaul> gkatsev: yeah, if you don't realy need one, don't use it, it's a pain
[07:52:03] <johnkpaul> also, hey Whirl3d!
[07:54:32] <seutje> geekluc: excuse me, "ban" a div?
[07:55:05] <geekluc> seutje, my english is bad. I want "prohibit" the menu
[07:55:12] <djsounds02> Whats that function called where you press add new and it gives you another text field?
[07:56:09] <djsounds02> I want to make a list but I there could be 5 items or more so I need the add new one so I can add more :)
[07:56:37] <gwinh_dev> append the an hmtl string in the dom
[07:56:44] <gwinh_dev> append an html string in the dom
[07:56:58] <djsounds02> that means nothing to me whatso evere
[07:57:05] <geekluc> I want to disable the menu that appears when I click the right mouse button
[07:57:41] <geekluc> I do this in a div dynamically added
[07:58:11] <djsounds02> gwinh_dev: That means nothing to me what so ever!
[07:58:32] <gwinh_dev> ?
[07:58:50] <NoiseEee> geekluc: ​$(reference).on('contextmenu',function() { return false; });​​​​​​​
[07:59:02] <djsounds02> gwinh_dev: do you have a search term I could use?
[07:59:04] <xckpd7> what would be the easiest way for me to follow along with this guide? https://github.com/kjbekkelund/writings/blob/master/published/understanding-backbone.md/
[07:59:10] <NoiseEee> also, geekluc: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+can+I+prohibit+the+right+click+of+the+mouse%3F

[08:00:13] <LindsayMac> ajpiano: Do you think that launching another bot using the WP script ran by someone here all the time would be worth it?
[08:00:45] <geekluc> guess I'm not being clear
[08:01:17] <ajpiano> LindsayMac: no, like i said, we're working on b-ot, we don't need another entrant into the race :)
[08:01:42] <geekluc> NoiseEee, I researched a lot. But I can not select the div. I tried to do something with onclick but I can not
[08:02:22] <LindsayMac> ajpiano:  ahh ok. I didn't see that. I had to walk away for a call.. Well, if you want inspiration, i suggest taking a look at the wordpress irc bot. Its really awesome and I think plenty of people have extended it.
[08:04:10] <HassanS> Hi guys!
[08:04:17] <Whirl3d> geekluc, do you have access to the parent of the div you want to handle the right click for?
[08:04:32] <NoiseEee> geekluc: what have you tried?  paste on jsfiddle.net
[08:05:34] <HassanS> I'm having some trouble.  I want to save a form's contents in localStorage, but only AFTER it validates (i'm using HTML5's pattern= and required attributes in the input tags).  Anyone know how to do this
[08:06:08] <HassanS> right now if someone hits 'submit' on a partially filled out form, it saves it
[08:06:16] <NoiseEee> geekluc: http://jsfiddle.net/4AyJU/
[08:06:18] <Whirl3d> So long as you select the parent (or somewhere up the heirarchy), you can use .on to handle the click event even for dynamic content. $(parent).on("click", "divClass", function (e) { e.preventDefault(). e.stopPropagation(); do stuff()});
[08:08:22] <geekluc> NoiseEee, Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/dDR8B/
[08:09:12] <geekluc> NoiseEee, Whirl3d the menu should be disabled in textarea
[08:10:57] <Whirl3d> geekluc, let's start by not adding click event inline
[08:11:36] <geekluc> Whirl3d, was the only way I found to capture the event of an element dynamically added
[08:11:38] <starsinmypockets> Any idea why my jQuery.getJSON(url) returns     "readyState": 1
[08:11:52] <starsinmypockets> If I visit the url I see the echoed json data I'm after
[08:12:02] <Whirl3d> did you try using on
[08:14:49] <Whirl3d> geekluc, I am not sure what you are trying to do ( probably a language barrier on my part).
[08:15:32] <Whirl3d> I think you want a button that when clicked adds a new textarea to the content div
[08:16:16] <Whirl3d> actually, I have no clue whatsoever
[08:16:29] <Whirl3d> or whensoever as it were
[08:19:31] <geekluc> Whirl3d, $.on() dont work
[08:25:31] <sm`> hello
[08:25:42] <sm`> whats the best way to save json objects on client side
[08:25:50] <sm`> so i can use them multiple times
[08:26:11] <sm`> so i dont have to make ajax calls every time clients navigates back to a page
[08:26:12] <NoiseEee> geekluc: http://jsfiddle.net/dDR8B/5/
[08:26:34] <faraway> sm`: make them cachable
[08:27:02] <faraway> sm`: if possible, this will avoid the browser to request it another time
[08:27:29] <faraway> sm`: for newer browsers you can use session storage
[08:27:39] <sm`> yeah i know the local storage
[08:27:40] <geekluc> NoiseEee, here dont work
[08:27:52] <sm`> but i need a universal solution ;]
[08:28:00] <JeffreyLevesque> anyone here use twitter bootstrap?
[08:28:09] <sm`> and i need to manipulate the objects
[08:28:15] <sm`> during the visit
[08:28:23] <sm`> so making call to the server is not the only reason
[08:29:03] <sm`> http://devpro.it/JSON/files/JSTONE-js.html
[08:29:04] <sm`> i found this
[08:31:19] <faraway> sm`: hmm i don't know this. one think i could say, don't  store it in cookies :D
[08:32:22] <faraway> sm`: ok seems that it uses the window.name  and as i remember right this is limited in the amount of data you can store
[08:34:00] <quicksilver> you can use flash local storage but it's quite nasty.
[08:34:57] <quicksilver> sm`: try http://pablotron.org/?cid=1557
[08:35:48] <pjammer> can a brother talk about theory in here? I'm using jQuery but unsure how to phrase my requirements, as it's above my pay grade.
[08:35:51] <quicksilver> or other answers in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692245/html5-local-storage-fallback-solutions
[08:36:00] <NoiseEee> geekluc: oh well, sorry to hear.  http://jsfiddle.net/dDR8B/5/ works just fine, and stops right-clicks on all textareas.  goodluck.
[08:37:14] <pjammer> I want to post details of a site using my script back to my server. Sort of like google analytics but less involved.
[08:37:18] <sm`> tnx to both of u
[08:37:56] <pjammer> basically act like a JS enabled webhook.
[08:38:59] <pjammer> would it simply be a POST request back, once the script is loaded that sends back the body tag, so i can parse the data on my end?
[08:40:10] <ivankuzev> yeah it needs to make request to the server when page is loaded
[08:40:29] <ivankuzev> not necceseary post
[08:40:56] <faraway> pjammer: from your question i assume that where the site is loaded and where you analyst is not on the same server ? otherwise you would know the content of the body, right ?
[08:41:09] <pjammer> correct.
[08:41:14] <pjammer> sorry i didn't mention that.
[08:41:41] <pjammer> i know there is a gif image approach, a jsonp and CORM(sp?)
[08:42:33] <faraway> pjammer: then you cannot do a post cause of the cross domain , so you need to do a get request (where you data is passed with the url) the maximum length of the url depends on the browser
[08:42:37] <ivankuzev> well...you can probably make a json out of $("body *")
[08:42:49] <pjammer> but if you are on a hosted platform CORS can't be done.
[08:45:08] <pjammer> ivankuzev: true. i guess like google anal does in their ecommerce section, they must pick and choose the fields that are your "main" money/balance fields to parse later... and pass, so they aren't getting crud back.
[08:45:35] <faraway> ivankuzev: do you know if triggering a submit to a form that post to another domain would work?
[08:46:03] <pjammer> this looks awesome: http://enable-cors.org/
[08:46:25] <pjammer> but don't think enough services would have the field or their users would have the know how, on how to implement.
[08:46:33] <ivankuzev> faraway:sorry havent tried yet
[08:46:40] <rburton-> Anyone interested in modifying jquery pageless for money?
[08:47:34] <rburton-> I'm looking to have it modified so it can be 'reset' allowing the same element to be reused on the same page in case of dynamic filtering etc.
[08:49:54] <faraway> pjammer: just for you information if you want to send the body via a json get request (http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html)  you probably need to split it into small requests
[08:56:04] <pjammer> faraway: thanks man. I can't think of any other way to get the following: 'I am on the checkout page, here is my order total, and here is my cookie token'.
[08:56:26] <pjammer> i spoke out what i'd need. obviously. not valid js there.
[08:56:30] <pjammer> i forgot a ;
[08:57:49] <faraway> pjammer: if you know the page you are running on, just do this checks with javascript rand then just send the necessary informations
[08:58:30] <faraway> pjammer: that would be way better then sending the whole page (some people use mobiles or slow connections ;) )
[08:58:30] <pjammer> so i can give my people a link to a JS file on my server, that would do that right?
[08:59:07] <pjammer> again it may be common knowledge here, but i'm missing spots in my knowledge so it's tough to piece together
[08:59:11] <faraway> pjammer: yes and if something on the page changes you can make the fixes on the file on your server
[08:59:44] <pjammer> now is that called server side JS? or is SS JS only when you like dynamically make a js file up on your server to then serve?
[09:01:13] <faraway> pjammer: server side is what is executed on the server. so no
[09:02:11] <pjammer> cool so faraway to recap (for me brain)
[09:02:14] <masak> I've discovered jQuery's .end, and I don't think I like it. :) are there commonly voiced opinions for or against .end floating around already?
[09:02:31] <masak> seems to me it's a way to keep chaining at the expense of readability most of the time.
[09:02:42] <pjammer> just have my user paste a link to a js script i serve, simple and easy....
[09:02:51] <gnarf> P.S. you can do cross domain post, you just can't read the result
[09:03:02] <ajpiano> masak: so don't use it :)
[09:03:05] <faraway> pjammer: but sorry … can help you further … need to go now
[09:03:30] <pjammer> in that script i can then check that i am on the right page, send back info i need, and boom i'm done. if not set cookie, if one is not set.
[09:03:40] <mikepj1> masak: or use indentation to keep track of where you are in the chain for better readability
[09:03:41] <faraway> pjammer: it also more e general question right now and not jquery anymore
[09:03:46] <pjammer> faraway: you've helped in more ways than you know.
[09:03:53] <masak> ajpiano: indeed. but I'll be teaching jQuery in a month, so I wanted to hear how others use it, too ;)
[09:03:55] <pjammer> yeah.
[09:04:04] <masak> ajpiano: indentation is an interesting idea.
[09:04:17] <ajpiano> masak: it can occasionally be useful, but realistically
[09:04:23] <ajpiano> people shouldn't be writing absurdly long chains
[09:04:28] <masak> right.
[09:04:30] <mikepj1> truth
[09:04:44] <duc_> hi, im using this http://www.addfullsize.com/
[09:05:03] <duc_> im trying to make left and right keyboard keys to move close the current "popup" and open the next one
[09:05:21] <duc_> how do i go about closing the current one and opening another?
[09:05:41] <gnarf> ajpiano / masak - the fact that it exists also means that no jQuery object can ever let go of the object that it was created from either
[09:09:58] <mikehaas763> what should I return to the jquery-ui autocomplete ajax if there is no data/matches?
[09:10:17] <mikehaas763> just return nothing or should I return a -1 or something else?
[09:11:12] <ajpiano> an empty array?
[09:11:41] <gnarf> ^^^ empty array
[09:13:26] <mikehaas763> Ok sounds good, so it's not too pick
[09:13:28] <mikehaas763> y
[09:16:45] <dispy> Hi
[09:17:22] <dispy> How can I get the file being uploaded in one of the callbacks in the jquery upload plugin? (e.g.: second, progress)
[09:17:36] <dispy> *(e.g. send, progress)
[09:19:19] <EnginA> hwo to search for multiple attr ?
[09:19:46] <EnginA> .dynamic[data-foo=5 && data-bar = 6] ?
[09:20:15] <Haprog> I think .class[attr1=val1][attr2=val2]
[09:20:18] <Haprog> not sure though
[09:20:20] <dispy> I think so too
[09:20:31] <ajpiano> nope, taht would match both
[09:20:36] <ajpiano> oh yeah, he wants both
[09:20:37] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:20:40] <Haprog> :P
[09:20:50] <EnginA> ok
[09:21:20] <Haprog> if you'd want on OR logit it would be ".class[attr1=val1], .class[attr2=val2]"
[09:21:25] <Haprog> *logic
[09:25:32] <dispy> no idea with respect to the callbacks?
[09:29:25] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/x45zf/18/ the alert is not printing
[09:32:03] <dispy> hm. A general problem with javascript: how can I get the _structure_ of the variables I get?
[09:32:18] <dogarrhea2> nevermind got it http://jsfiddle.net/x45zf/21/
[09:32:39] <dispy> example: I have to data.files. If I put it in JSON.stringify, it's empty. In fact it isn't, as I can iterate over it using jquery and alert its contents directly
[09:32:50] <dispy> however, if I do _not_ know the structures directly, what can I do to get them?
[09:34:19] <tch> hi all :)
[09:35:32] <donics> hi #jquery, what's the best practice for waiting on an external script to load?
[09:36:09] <Drozd> Hello. Is this right place to ask for help?
[09:36:40] <dogarrhea2> depends. i'm sure people in here are up for doing sexual favors in addition to jquery
[09:36:43] <dispy> @donics: $.get has a callback. this is called when the script has finished loading
[09:37:16] <tch> i'm newbie and have some small problem, my code here: https://gist.github.com/3218327
[09:37:51] <ktstowell> input:radio is incorrect
[09:37:56] <donics> dispy: that's what i suspected, getscript. thanks.
[09:38:01] <tch> I want put into spans from some class text from value attribute for this span
[09:38:03] <ktstowell> input[type=radio]
[09:38:10] <Cryp71c> Does JQuery have anything to easily maintain caret position when using .val to assign stuff?
[09:38:14] <tch> ktstowell: works, but thh ;)
[09:38:30] <Cryp71c> Or is there an alternative to doing a .val which does natively maintain caret position?
[09:39:25] <ryanneufeld> Cryp71c: what do you mean?
[09:41:08] <zorph> tch: that paste code with the html..it's too hard to see what you're trying to do
[09:41:44] <ktstowell> Not understanding "spans from some class text"
[09:42:06] <zorph> yaa
[09:42:32] <ktstowell> Really though, the whole sentence. I'm a bit obfuscated.
[09:43:02] <Cryp71c> ryanneufeld, if an input has focus and the caret is at a particular location inside that input and you do a $(this).val($(this).val()+'something'); the caret moves to after the "g" in "something"
[09:43:29] <ryanneufeld> Cryp71c: ah, then you'd need to get the position before you make the change
[09:43:38] <ryanneufeld> then reset it after the change
[09:43:50] <ryanneufeld> there isn't a way to do that built in to jquery
[09:44:05] <ryanneufeld> there may be a plugin, but I don't personally know of any
[09:44:20] <zorph> tch: please clarify
[09:44:29] <tch> zorph: it's code with sinatra (ruby), but: https://gist.github.com/3218327
[09:45:22] <tch> but i show user list of option with radio button and i want (after radio button is pressed) change text next to radio button into input text field
[09:45:35] <ktstowell> tch so you want the innerHtml of the spans injected to teh attributes of the radio inputs?
[09:46:09] <dogarrhea2> hurray.  I give up.  no way to do sound natively on android in a robust manner
[09:46:19] <dogarrhea2> time to prompt users to download my junk app from the store
[09:46:28] <dogarrhea2> and maintain 2 extra branches of development
[09:46:35] <ktstowell> So do it non-rubostly? ;)
[09:46:37] * hlveheart slaps dogarrhea2 around a bit with a large trout
[09:46:39] <ktstowell> erm
[09:46:42] <ktstowell> robustly*
[09:46:44] <hlveheart> your name is so gross
[09:46:45] <hlveheart> lol
[09:47:06] <tch> ktstowell: no...i have in span text or input text field and i want after user press button change all input text into just text
[09:47:12] <dogarrhea2> ? this is what i call my sister
[09:47:34] <hlveheart> o_o
[09:47:34] <zorph> tch: http://bpaste.net/show/QlYvFLY3TiTqzV2f0aRV/
[09:47:45] <dogarrhea2> i was visiting her at google one time and called her "dogarrhea" in front of her coworkers.  now her coworkers call her "dogarrhea"
[09:47:51] <hlveheart> LOL
[09:47:52] <hlveheart> thats s omean
[09:48:49] <Drozd> I do $.ajax, but it error'd to No transport (I've read it's because of cross-site scripting)
[09:49:02] <Drozd> how to override this?
[09:49:38] <Drozd> I tried jQuery.support.cors = true; // force cross-site scripting (as of jQuery 1.5)
[09:49:43] <Drozd> with no use
[09:50:17] <tch> zorph: thx
[09:50:50] <Drozd> i tried crossDomain: false, again no use
[09:50:57] <zorph> tch: or this   http://bpaste.net/show/WSZkCNMee88SvWaQfhHz/
[09:52:39] <zorph> strange to put an input inside of a span though...
[09:57:12] <tch> zorph: hmm...i test your proposition and they don't work exactly i want. They put in every span same value. I wantt put in every span value from this span
[09:57:52] <tch> maybe i can't say what i want :(
[09:59:21] <Drozd> I do $.ajax, but it error'd to No transport (I've read it's because of cross-site scripting). how to override this? I tried jQuery.support.cors = true; and crossDomain: false with no use
[09:59:47] <ajpiano> Drozd: is your server set up to do cors
[10:00:06] <Drozd> ajpiano: not sure
[10:00:11] <ajpiano> in other words, no
[10:00:34] <Drozd> ajpiano: i need to get data from xml
[10:00:44] <ajpiano> cool
[10:00:45] <ajpiano> story
[10:01:17] <ajpiano> most of the cross-origin solutions involve some measure of server support
[10:01:24] <zorph> tch: u can't give the same 'name' attribute to the radio..and the span..
[10:01:28] <Drozd> ajpiano: thanks, but could you help? it's working on one device and not working on other
[10:01:41] <ajpiano> Drozd: http://enable-cors.org/
[10:01:53] <zorph> tch: sorry I didn't read it properly...
[10:01:55] <ajpiano> Drozd: i can't really, i'm just trying to give you anudge in the right direction
[10:02:04] <ajpiano> cors isn't a magic thing you just turn on from where you're making the request
[10:02:08] <ajpiano> both sides have to be in on the bargain
[10:02:23] <Drozd> ajpiano: problem is i have no access to remote server
[10:02:32] <Drozd> ajpiano: (service)
[10:02:39] <ajpiano> do they have a JSONP api ?
[10:02:44] <Drozd> no
[10:02:46] <Drozd> just XML
[10:02:57] <ajpiano> hm
[10:03:03] <zorph> tch: do you want to set the value of the span? Or the input in the span?
[10:03:22] <ajpiano> Drozd: can you write a proxy
[10:03:27] <Drozd> no
[10:03:29] <ajpiano> Drozd: a local page that makes the remote request
[10:03:30] <ajpiano> ?
[10:04:02] <ajpiano> Drozd: you can also setup a yahoo pipes service to consume their xml and then you can get it back as jsonp
[10:04:53] <Drozd> ajpiano: My page Is for embeded devices with closed platform (and browser). Service from which I'm downloading XML is also closed platform.
[10:05:45] <Drozd> ajpiano: I just need to get XML from external service and parse it in my app. It is working on new versions of that device but not on older ones
[10:05:54] <ajpiano> and somehow that has something to do with jquery how
[10:07:47] <Drozd> ajpiano: could you please help me if I send (pastebin) you code?
[10:07:56] <hlveheart> js f i d d l e!
[10:07:57] <hlveheart> >:/
[10:08:10] <ajpiano> Drozd: it might help
[10:08:15] <ajpiano> but it doesn't mean i can help you
[10:08:30] <Drozd> ajpiano: thank you, you are really kind
[10:08:31] <ajpiano> cause it sounds like you have some kind of hardware problem in your hands
[10:08:42] <ktstowell> I also do not understand the affinity to pastebin in this channel
[10:08:54] <ajpiano> ktstowell: this channel has no affinity for it
[10:09:00] <ajpiano> but newish people tend to use it
[10:09:14] <ajpiano> i tend to think cause people hear "use a paste bin" and then they go to pastebin.com
[10:09:17] <ajpiano> it's kinda, the worst
[10:09:18] <ajpiano> :(
[10:09:30] <ktstowell> Ah, true true.
[10:10:16] <zorph> I use bpaste.net
[10:10:29] <Drozd> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/LMaaLkT7
[10:11:59] <ajpiano> Drozd: like i expected, it would seem like it would work in all places at first glance... do you know what browsers are running on the various devices
[10:12:08] <hazamonzo_> Hey folks. Im using fancybox. I just want to display some text. Should this not work? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1121802/
[10:12:21] <hazamonzo_> I get the fancybox but no text
[10:13:10] <jSpike> hi guys, how do i check if $("table td:first[id=blah]") finds anything or not?
[10:13:42] <Drozd> ajpiano: it's the same browser - Samsung Smart TV. It's Maze  browser (probably Gecko core).
[10:14:05] <ktstowell> jSpike: just wrap it in an if statment and if it doesn't it will return '[]'
[10:14:11] <ajpiano> jeez
[10:14:15] <ajpiano> Drozd: what alerts are happening
[10:14:26] <ktstowell> ie. an empty array, so run it against .length
[10:14:35] <zorph> I like to use size()
[10:14:43] <ktstowell> you would!
[10:14:53] <jSpike> aha, great thx!
[10:15:02] <zorph> if($(selection).size() > 0)
[10:16:00] <rmurphey> jSpike: $('#nonexistent').length will be 0
[10:16:02] <Drozd> ajpiano: xhr.status:0 xhr.text:No Transport thrownError:No Transport
[10:16:26] <ajpiano> Drozd: so it isn't making the xdomain request?
[10:17:00] <hazamonzo_> hmm
[10:17:14] <Drozd> ajpiano: this problem, but solution is not working http://jaspermorgan.com/matchmaking-jquery-and-samsung-smart-tv
[10:18:05] <ajpiano> Drozd: which version of juquery are you using
[10:18:33] <Drozd> ajpiano: tried 1.4.2, 1.5.2 and now 1.7.2
[10:19:40] <Drozd> ajpiano: it's exatly same problem as on that page but their solution is not working so I'm looking for other way how to solve it
[10:19:50] <ajpiano> Drozd: i'm sorry, i don't really have a bloody clue off the top of my head
[10:20:00] <ajpiano> this isn't exactly something that comes up every day :p
[10:20:51] <ajpiano> Drozd: is this data that you're supposed to be consuming :p
[10:21:05] <ajpiano> cause normally i'd expect they'd have a provision by which it was available in a cross domain way
[10:21:42] <mikepj1> http://jsperf.com/jquery-size-vs-length
[10:22:06] <zorph> hazamonzo_: did u get that code from the fancybox docs?
[10:22:30] <zorph> hazamonzo_: usually you have your content in an html element, then call fancybox on that element
[10:22:36] <Drozd> ajpiano: when I change the dataType from text/xml to jsonp, it gives me 200 OK but I cannot access data, bcs of parse error (data are xml...).
[10:22:47] <hazamonzo_> zorph: Kinda. I was reading the API
[10:23:03] <zorph> hazamonzo_: any reason you have to pass the "hello world" in the fancybox() function?
[10:23:06] <ajpiano> Drozd: but it actaulyl sends back the data in xml format
[10:23:13] <ajpiano> ?? even with a jsonp?
[10:23:36] <zorph> read the fancybox docs and basic example..then take it from there
[10:23:44] <hazamonzo_> zorph: No reason. i did try to add a div with some html and apply the fancybox to it though
[10:24:29] <Drozd> ajpiano: text dataType gives me: No transport, jsonp dataType gives me parser error (I've read that xsitescripts can be override by settinf dataType to jsonp)
[10:24:36] <Drozd> ajpiano: and it seems working
[10:25:09] <Drozd> ajpiano: but then I get error, bcs parser script is trying to parse jsonp data which are not included (bcs. its xml)
[10:25:52] <ajpiano> hm, so you need to get it to use the jsonp transport and then either leave the result alone or call $.parseXML() on it
[10:26:19] <ajpiano> you might be able to do this with an ajaxTransport
[10:26:45] <Drozd> ajpiano: hmmm
[10:26:50] <ajpiano> Drozd: have you seen this page: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[10:26:52] <danzik17> ajpiano: that won't work due to the way jsonp works, no?
[10:27:18] <ajpiano> danzik17: i have no idea how this crazy getup he's requesting is working, but if it's sending back data, he can probably get it to parse somehow
[10:27:21] <ajpiano> thats all i'm sayin ;)
[10:28:22] <Drozd> ajpiano: could you please apply that to my code on pastebin (or whatever service you prefer :) )?
[10:29:25] <Drozd> ajpiano: I'm pretty new to jQuery and errors like this are stopping me to learn it properly. (too much time spent googling errors)
[10:29:34] <dispy> how can I get a unique identifier out of a string?
[10:29:43] <dispy> a hash would do it, but I don't think jquery provides that out of the box?
[10:30:15] <ajpiano> Drozd: i can't right now, sorry
[10:31:31] <ajpiano> Drozd: i might be able to help if you set up a live demo, that requests the live data
[10:31:45] <ajpiano> so that i can futz with the converting part without having to get the whole thing up and running
[10:32:38] <zorph> hazamonzo_: don't use the iframe property...and put the function within $(document).ready callback
[10:33:25] <zorph> hazamonzo_: http://bpaste.net/show/9viEiOOI9KywBkMOBUGO/
[10:33:58] <Drozd> ajpiano: thank you, but I don't think you could make live demo, bcs. you would need that browser to test it properly
[10:34:06] <hazamonzo_> zorph: Amazing :)
[10:34:08] <hazamonzo_> Thank you
[10:34:22] * hazamonzo_ is still hungover from last night. Not thinking straight
[10:34:33] <ajpiano> Drozd: but assuming you can give me a service that gives back xml when you make a jsonp request, then i can theoretically try to do the jquery part that will make it give you back xml instead
[10:34:36] <ajpiano> but it's up to you
[10:34:37] <zorph> hazamonzo_: np glad to help
[10:34:37] <ajpiano> :p
[10:34:39] <danzik17> Drozd: can you just use YQL?  ( think this was mentioned earlier )  http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/

[10:36:28] <wfq> hi guys

[10:37:10] <wfq> supposed idName contains the id of an textbox element how do I change it to be enabled again? Shouldn't that be $(idName).attr('disabled','')?
[10:38:04] <lathan> Hi b-ot
[10:38:14] <lathan> oops
[10:38:17] <lathan> sorry b-ot
[10:40:08] <christo_m> is there a way to add callback on the fly to a fullCalendar element, as part of the options
[10:40:33] <ajpiano> Drozd: i can't get into a whole long thing here
[10:40:34] <zorph> wfq: $("#myInput").attr("disabled", false);
[10:40:36] <ajpiano> i'm really sorry
[10:40:44] <ajpiano> but i mean
[10:40:48] <ajpiano> you can pm me, that's a thing
[10:40:52] <ajpiano> oh i didn't see that
[10:40:54] <ajpiano> :/
[10:41:18] <wfq> zorph, oh thanks. I just realized that above 1.6 prop is prefered?
[10:45:01] <zorph> ya use prop then
[10:52:12] <LindsayMac> I'm looking for a nice little plugin or tutorial or something that can make a little tab where I can show/hide my navigation (or iphone).

[11:21:49] <beefz0r> hello people
[11:22:05] <shoky> HELLOW
[11:22:09] * hlveheart slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[11:22:22] <shoky> ;x
[11:22:26] <beefz0r> how do I do something similair to this using only selectors ?
[11:22:41] <hlveheart> similar to what./
[11:22:47] <shoky> this
[11:22:51] <hlveheart> this.
[11:22:54] <beefz0r> document.getElementById("id").getElementsByClassName("class");
[11:23:37] <shoky> what have you tried so far?
[11:24:20] <beefz0r> $("#id").$(".class");
[11:24:27] <beefz0r> I'm a rookie so I was just guessing :p
[11:26:29] <hazamonzo_> zorph: hmm. So i have a div with an id email_form. i#ve set this div to display:hidden. I have a button that has a click function. Im using the following code. $("#email_form").fancybox(); Should be fine no?
[11:26:51] <shoky> beefz0r: $('#id .class')
[11:27:01] <beefz0r> thanks
[11:27:26] <shoky> or if you want to chain stuff, that's the same as: $('#id').find('.class')
[11:27:41] <beefz0r> nope it's fine ;)
[11:33:13] <beefz0r> can I use regex in a selector ?
[11:34:52] <amh345> i have a js file with a function for clicking on a div class. im trying to override that click in another js class by changing the class name.  however, even the the class name has changed it's still clickable even though the class name is different.   any ideas why? is this normal behaviour?
[11:39:18] <jammsen> Why isnt that working? http://jsfiddle.net/7kjR9/3/
[11:39:31] <amh345> even my original ('class_name').toggle('mouseover') stops functioning when i change the name.   yet the .submit(); still picks up
[11:41:24] <amh345> oh .live('click', function() on the original class name might do the trick
[11:41:28] <Whirl3d> jammsen your for statement is incorrect
[11:41:48] <jammsen> Whirl3d: how is it right?
[11:42:02] <Whirl3d> I think you mean i<=maxentries

[11:43:07] <amh345> what about my question is a troll?
[11:43:10] <jammsen> Whirl3d: ty, im php progger xD
[11:43:13] <Whirl3d> .live is deprecated.
[11:43:14] <zorph> hazamonzo_: call fancybox on the wrapper div...
[11:43:29] <beefz0r> .parent doesn't work ?
[11:43:39] <amh345> oh, it is?   well i dont see how me not knowing that is trolling

[11:46:57] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:47:06] <Whirl3d> jammsen, every time you do $(selector), jquery has to run through the dom to find your element....which takes time. By caching a reference to the element in a variable, you only have to parse the dom once.

[12:07:40] <LindsayMac> I'm a little confused with slideToggle
[12:07:57] <LindsayMac> from what I read, it gives an element a height from 0 but it also sets display:none if 0?
[12:08:00] <Deele> Please, anyone familiar with this, help me. Is there a special way to make .load(iframeLoadCallback) work inside $.fn.extend({ myfunction: function() { var newIframe = $('<iframe/>').load(iframeLoadCallback); var iframeLoadCallback = function() { ... } } }); ?
[12:08:02] <ravenzz> FernandoBasso that's weird
[12:09:12] <FernandoBasso> Some time ago, I was able to solve it with setTimeout, but now it is not working.
[12:09:43] <FernandoBasso> I thought it could be that I'm assigning .blur to three elements at  time, but I tried with a single one and it didn't work either.
[12:12:59] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: you have multiple elements with the same ID.  that is a major no-no.
[12:13:36] <NoiseEee> oh maybe not sorry
[12:16:31] <freazy> how can i animate the div .inner-content to top: -999 ?  http://jsfiddle.net/v9v5a/
[12:17:53] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: "this" refers to "window" inside your set timeout.
[12:18:34] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, yes it animates to 0 then it sets display to none
[12:18:42] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6Wbk/1/
[12:18:56] <MistuhKurtz> if you need to animate individual properties by themselves then go ahead and use animate() or another animate wrapper method
[12:19:15] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6Wbk/2/ even
[12:19:24] <MistuhKurtz> for example, sometimes I need to fade something out, but I don't want it to lose document flow, so I have to animate opacity instead of using fadeOut();
[12:19:43] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: either way, screw all those ids man, use classes.  IDs like "email0", "email1" etc are terrible/useless
[12:20:04] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  ok i understand.. but when you say loose document flow, what do you mean?
[12:20:48] <MistuhKurtz> Elements with position:relative, floats, and default (position:static;) are all a part of the document flow
[12:20:57] <FernandoBasso> NoiseEee: Let me see.
[12:21:11] <MistuhKurtz> an absolute:position; element, or an element set to display:none; isn't a part of the document flow
[12:22:28] <LindsayMac> oh right
[12:23:01] <FernandoBasso> NoiseEee: Could you get it to work?
[12:23:10] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: did you visit my link?
[12:23:25] <FernandoBasso> Yes. It didn't work on firefox.
[12:23:37] <FernandoBasso> 14.0.1 (linux)
[12:24:07] <Ianrr> I'm detecting if an element is visible with .is(:visible) …. If the element is not visible I want to make sure it becomes visible but I don't know anything about the structure of the HTML.  Any ideas?  What about just setting all the parents() to show()
[12:24:31] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: not sure if you're visiting the correct link; i'm on 14.0.1 on linux too, its fine
[12:25:47] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: but the bigger issue is this:  FORCING a cursor somewhere / NOT LETTING a user do something on a webpage is really, really annoying to users.  Who gives a crap if their email address isn't valid?  If it's not valid, let them know, but don't FORCE them back to the email <input>.
[12:26:00] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: don't try to control your users/children/friends.
[12:26:03] <Deele> Ianrr, if you have selected element and *can* detected if it is visible, then you should be able to use same selector to make it visible, anyway, $(selector).toggle() will toggle display from hidden to block and vica-versa
[12:26:13] <jammsen> how do i scroll to a div container with a classname?
[12:26:21] <jammsen> the entire page
[12:26:45] <FernandoBasso> I am already letting them know, but I'm not the boss, and I'm forced to do that in that case.
[12:27:03] <FernandoBasso> NoiseEee: By the way, I couldn't agree more with you.
[12:27:08] <Ianrr> Deele:  What if its hidden not because the element itself is hidde, but maybe the div its contained within is hidden
[12:27:20] <freazy> how can i animate the div .inner-content to top: -999 ? http://jsfiddle.net/v9v5a/1/
[12:27:24] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: gotcha
[12:27:43] <Deele> Ianrr, then loop through every .parent() of selector
[12:29:12] <Ianrr> $(yourelement).parents().filter(':hidden').show(); the same thing?
[12:30:03] <LindsayMac> So this is my little script that I am working on. Strangely, its the same code as on my site, but here it's starting off opened versus closed. It should be closed to start. ANYWAYS... I know that I need to somehow set the box to display:none to avoid the flash of open content at the begining, but I can't seem to figure that part out http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/gzVDv/1/
[12:31:51] <rufo> if I have - span class="voteContainer"
[12:32:05] <rufo> is it ok to reference it like
[12:32:06] <rufo> '._voteContainer'
[12:32:18] <NoiseEee> rufo: why would it be?
[12:32:25] <NoiseEee> what do you mean by 'reference' ?
[12:32:42] <FernandoBasso> NoiseEee: Oh, the example from the second link worked. Thanks a bunch.
[12:32:43] <rufo> trying to make something like
[12:32:44] <rufo> voteContainer = button.closest('._voteContainer');
[12:32:48] <janthony> Does anyone know if there is a jQuery plugin that will automatically resize text in a container/paragraph based off a min/max font size? For example, BigText jQuery plugin works great for resizing a single line of text, but doesn't work for multiple lines of text.
[12:32:50] <FernandoBasso> By the way, why does this happen?
[12:33:27] <NoiseEee> rufo: why that instead of .voteContainer ?  what makes you even think you could use ._voteContainer?
[12:33:34] <jSpike> hi guys, how can i get a row from a datatable and check if the first cell has certain text?  the first cell/column is hidden
[12:33:42] <mehrdad> before i try to put up a testcase, i'd like to explain the problem first, may there be an answer. i am using the jquery ui to slide three divs up and down upon hover. it works nicely until i move the mouse quicky over the three adjacent divs, in this case the now slid up divs remain stuck in their place and i have to hover over every single one of them to have them slide back down (hide).
[12:33:52] <Deele> Please, anyone familiar with this, help me. Is there a special way to make .load(iframeLoadCallback) work inside $.fn.extend({ myfunction: function() { var newIframe = $('<iframe/>').load(iframeLoadCallback); var iframeLoadCallback = function() { ... } } }); ?
[12:33:56] <mehrdad> any clues what might cause that behavior?
[12:34:06] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: scope.   'this' isn't bound to the same thing in your anonymous function
[12:34:09] <rufo> well it's like that
[12:34:20] <rufo> but I'm not sure how it got that way
[12:34:29] <beefz0r> is there something simpler than "jQuery()" ?
[12:34:30] <rufo> and I'm not sure what ._ means either
[12:34:37] <FernandoBasso> NoiseEee: All right. Thanks.
[12:34:41] <LindsayMac> mehrdad: if you go slow do they slide up  on mouse over and down on mouse out?
[12:35:31] <mehrdad> yes they do
[12:35:50] <Deele> strādāju
[12:35:53] <Deele> pf
[12:35:58] <mehrdad> they are caption divs on images btw
[12:36:07] <dzajdband> beefz0r: you mean $()?
[12:36:27] <LindsayMac> and to slide are you using .animate or something else?
[12:37:31] <mehrdad> LindsayMac: on hover event : $("> div.caption", this).show("slide",{direction:"down"},"fast");   and for hiding:   $("> div.caption", this).hide();
[12:37:37] <beefz0r> oh yea thanks dzajband
[12:37:48] <mehrdad> yes, it is not slide down exactly, it just hides on mouse out
[12:38:41] <LindsayMac> hmm.
[12:39:25] <LindsayMac> you need to use .stop(true, true)
[12:39:39] <LindsayMac> it will clear and stop animations when you click another
[12:41:25] <mehrdad> hmm, so i call that on the target element?
[12:42:00] <LindsayMac> http://api.jquery.com/stop/ mehrdad
[12:42:17] <LindsayMac> put it after your .show
[12:43:19] <mehrdad> ok, so i figure it kinda lags behind when i move the mouse quickly right?
[12:43:56] <LindsayMac> no it just moves on to the other animation before it finishes so you need to clear it
[12:46:14] <mehrdad> that's what i meant tho, it lags behind my mouse movement
[12:46:28] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  you are not understanding
[12:46:34] <mehrdad> btw, no go still, have to read the docs
[12:47:05] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  you NEED to call the .stop() in your animation so that when you start another one, it stops and resets the current one
[12:47:12] <LindsayMac> otherwise it will get stuck.. like yours is
[12:48:13] <mehrdad> i know what you mean, when i move the mouse on to the next element it begins animating that one before the last one is finished. it kinda can't run all in parallel
[12:48:26] <LindsayMac> which is why you need .stop()
[12:48:30] <shoky> your first mistake was your worst: <mehrdad> before i try to put up a testcase, i'd like to explain the problem first
[12:48:49] <shoky> would've been done with all this a long time ago with a fiddle
[12:48:50] <freazy> how can i animate the div .inner-content to top: -999 ? http://jsfiddle.net/v9v5a/1/
[12:49:23] <mehrdad> shoky: i think i got the answer fairly quickly tho and kudos to LindsayMac for that
[12:49:47] <shoky> mehrdad ok sorry, i saw you still saying 'no go'
[12:50:06] <LindsayMac> shoky:  the issue is that his slidedown animations were getting stuck if he moved the mouse across all of them at once
[12:50:14] <mehrdad> well, have to play around with the stop() a little :p
[12:50:28] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  just add it
[12:50:42] <shoky> a fiddle would have been the most clear is all i was saying
[12:50:44] <shoky> nvm
[12:50:50] <LindsayMac> its not hard.. nothing to play with.. how to add it to your code is right in the docs
[12:51:12] <azulsoljah_w> talk test
[12:51:23] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i was pretty clear on what was wrong with it.. he just wasnt listening
[12:51:25] <mehrdad> you are right, i get really lazy when it comes to fiddles, my bad habit i know :/
[12:52:05] <LindsayMac> speaking of fiddles.. anyone wanna lend a hand with mine?
[12:52:07] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/gzVDv/2/
[12:52:14] <shoky> he wouldn't have to listen if you could jsut fiddle with his fiddle
[12:52:19] <LindsayMac> Strangely, its the same code as on my site, but here it's starting off opened versus closed. It should be closed to start. ANYWAYS... I know that I need to somehow set the box to display:none to avoid the flash of open content at the begining, but I can't seem to figure that part out
[12:52:35] <LindsayMac> that sounds dirty
[12:52:38] <shoky> it's starting off open because of the .click()
[12:52:41] <shoky> i know ;p
[12:52:52] <LindsayMac> shoky:  and sometimes its good to tell people what to do versus do it for them.. no?
[12:53:01] <tw2113> wha? people not listening?
[12:53:08] <tw2113> da'fu?
[12:53:10] <shoky> all i was referring to was: <mehrdad> before i try to put up a testcase, i'd like to explain the problem first
[12:53:16] <shoky> which is just wrong for this channel
[12:53:22] <shoky> bad approach
[12:53:39] * shoky jumps on tw2
[12:53:42] <shoky> 113 . .
[12:53:56] <mehrdad> jeez guys :D
[12:54:11] <LindsayMac> Ok.. i figure with simple questions or at least a starting point, you could easily give them a "try adding this" answer.. but thas fine
[12:54:19] <mehrdad> everything's alright
[12:54:32] <shoky> jeez i'm not saying it HAS to be with a fiddle and it CANT work otherwise
[12:54:42] <mehrdad> damn i really need to kick my ass into fiddling :p
[12:54:55] <shoky> but since he specifically pointed it out that he thought of making a testcase, but nahh instead he'll try to explain in words instead
[12:55:11] <LindsayMac> Well I have a test case if you wanna look at mine ;)
[12:55:17] <shoky> i did, and i responded :)
[12:55:21] <LindsayMac> where?
[12:55:23] <shoky> <shoky> it's starting off open because of the .click()
[12:55:28] <LindsayMac> Did it get buried?
[12:55:30] <LindsayMac> i missed it
[12:55:38] <shoky> 3 min ago ;P
[12:55:47] <LindsayMac> Ohh the .click
[12:55:52] <LindsayMac> i thought you were still talking to mehrdad
[12:56:17] <shoky> ya, i shoulda said who it was for
[12:56:17] <LindsayMac> then why.. with the exact same code, does it hide on mine?
[12:56:42] <shoky> exact same code, exact same html, exact same css?
[12:56:46] <shoky> doubts
[12:57:12] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea.. i copied and pasted.
[12:57:23] <LindsayMac> i'd triple check again and paste it all over again.. hold on
[12:57:25] <shoky> your whole site?
[12:57:39] <LindsayMac> shoky:  well no but the parts that interact with that code.
[12:58:04] <LindsayMac> the js on my site doesn't have anything in it that would tell that container to hide..
[12:58:23] <shoky> if you remove the .click()
[12:58:28] <shoky> does it start out visible?
[12:58:51] <LindsayMac> it starts out hidden but then displaying it doesnt work
[12:59:54] <rufo> I'm getting a "not defined" here
[12:59:55] <LindsayMac> I thought .click was just a way to tell this script to run when clicked..
[13:00:03] <rufo>                        voteHistoryContainer.slideDown(1000, voteCotainer.insertAfter(voteHistoryContainer));
[13:00:05] <shoky> LindsayMac: that's the first .click
[13:00:10] <rufo> voteContainer is not defineed
[13:00:11] <shoky> LindsayMac: i was talking about the second one
[13:00:19] <shoky> right at the end   .click()
[13:00:19] <rufo> but the line before I do
[13:00:29] <LindsayMac> shoky:  that was the one I removed..
[13:00:30] <rufo> voteContainer.css and it gets the voteContainer
[13:00:36] <rufo> doesn't say it's not defined
[13:00:37] <LindsayMac> see for yourself in the fiddle
[13:00:58] * mehrdad bites his tongue to keep peace intact
[13:01:01] <shoky> see what in the fiddle?
[13:01:31] <LindsayMac> the one i posted with my question..
[13:01:40] <LindsayMac> the one which you are referencing for the .click()
[13:01:47] <shoky> yes, that fiddle
[13:01:52] <shoky> but see WHAT in it :)
[13:01:58] <shoky> dunno, you said: see for yourself
[13:02:01] <LindsayMac> remove the .click and you can see what I am talking about
[13:02:04] <shoky> donno what you're referring to is all
[13:02:15] <LindsayMac> that removing the .click closes the div but doesnt open it again
[13:02:20] <shoky> i see that the click doesnt happen automatically on load, so it is hidden as expected
[13:02:29] <shoky> it opens again fine when i click
[13:02:40] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/gzVDv/5/
[13:03:09] <LindsayMac> gah my mistake.... I stupidly commented the whole line. I'm sorry..
[13:03:15] <shoky> heh
[13:03:23] <mehrdad> yeah the fiddles :p
[13:03:57] <mehrdad> ...are cool of course
[13:04:21] <shoky> but you wouldn't take them to the beach with you
[13:04:24] <LindsayMac> So for the sake of learning.. WHY does that help? I do not understand exactly what that did..
[13:04:41] <shoky> LindsayMac:  calling  .click()  with no arguments triggers a click
[13:05:19] <LindsayMac> I thought you needed to actually CLICK to trigger a click
[13:05:26] <shoky> nope
[13:05:34] <shoky> ok, it triggers a click event, not a click :P
[13:05:56] <LindsayMac> well yea.. i knew what you were talking about.. but I thought you had to actually CLICK to trigger a click event
[13:06:36] <LindsayMac> this is so weird.. So basically the opposite of what works on the fiddle, works on my site.. wtf
[13:07:00] <shoky> the starting point is opposite
[13:07:11] <shoky> some of your css is doing it, or some code
[13:07:23] <LindsayMac> hmmm...
[13:08:09] <LindsayMac> I just copied and pasted the CSS from my site to the fiddle... no change..
[13:08:29] <LindsayMac> then I copied and pasted ALL of the JS for that specific interaction including the part where i previously commented out the //do something
[13:08:31] <shoky> for example if you got jqmobile on your site
[13:08:39] <shoky> maybe its doing something
[13:09:01] * mehrdad goes back home and thinks about picking up the fiddles and going the beach again
[13:09:12] <shoky> ;D
[13:09:25] <LindsayMac> shoky:  I included jqm on the fiddle to be safe
[13:09:37] <mehrdad> yeah, i'm still stuck, just so you know
[13:09:38] <shoky> i was just giving it as an example
[13:09:48] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  make a fiddle
[13:09:53] <shoky> of something that could be affecting it
[13:09:59] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i know.. but Im going through systematically to try and see what is effecting it..
[13:10:16] <mehrdad> right, after reading the docs throughly
[13:10:17] <shoky> fun ;S
[13:10:38] <LindsayMac> and I dont have a clue because aside from a swipe script (which is called after this code and really I dont see how it could be affecting it)
[13:10:44] <mehrdad> stop() just does nothing it seems, whenever i put it
[13:10:49] <LindsayMac> there isnt much to this
[13:10:59] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  did you include the parameters?
[13:11:09] <mehrdad> yes and no
[13:11:36] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  at this point.. no code , youre not gonna get much help
[13:11:45] <mehrdad> let me read up on the docs and  the great comments,
[13:12:41] <Einzig> Hello. I am trying to make every border of an empty textarea red. But it only works on the first one. Does anyone know why? an alert shows it does iterate over both. http://jsbin.com/uxukof/14/edit
[13:13:33] <shoky> LindsayMac: i see you have display:none on the #stickyheader both in the css and inline style attribute
[13:13:53] <shoky> try keeping it all to one place
[13:13:59] <shoky> just so there's less going on
[13:14:03] <LindsayMac> shoky:  well that was when I was trying to figure out something that was mentioned to me..
[13:14:20] <shoky> k
[13:14:22] <LindsayMac> shoky:  basically my issue with how the script is working on MY site is that when the page loads, it shows the menu content briefly and then hides it
[13:14:41] <LindsayMac> So someone suggested I simply add "display:none" to that element so when it loads, it loads hidden and then let the JS take over
[13:15:11] <shoky> yes, but you added it in 2 places ;p
[13:15:14] <shoky> to the same element
[13:15:32] <LindsayMac> Ahh i probably forgot to remove it from the other when I was testing..
[13:15:42] <shoky> keep to seperate css
[13:15:47] <LindsayMac> Do you wanna see the live site? I can show you.. I just need your IP address and first born ;)
[13:15:57] <shoky> okz
[13:15:58] <garciawebdev> LindsayMac, don't do that, if you put it on display:none, visitors with JS disabled won't see the navbar
[13:16:20] <LindsayMac> garciawebdev:  first, no one for this site is going to browse to it with js disabled.. second.. its a mobile site
[13:16:25] <garciawebdev> (ok, I know not many browse without JS)
[13:16:39] <LindsayMac> its not that not many.. its almost none.. except those paranoid types.
[13:16:49] <garciawebdev> ok, I know
[13:16:59] <garciawebdev> just progressive enhancement suggests that
[13:17:07] <garciawebdev> you can do what you want :)
[13:17:23] <LindsayMac> there isnt a smart phone in the world that I know of that would browse without JS enabled
[13:17:36] <garciawebdev> if it's a mobile site, there are more reasons to provide no-JS alternative
[13:17:47] <garciawebdev> mobile is not smartphones only
[13:18:01] <garciawebdev> my old Nokia 5320 can also browse and has CSS
[13:18:15] <garciawebdev> it depends on your market
[13:18:52] <garciawebdev> but you can use Gmail or Facebook on that device with a basic HTML experience
[13:18:59] <garciawebdev> just my 2cents :)
[13:19:25] <LindsayMac> Honestly.. its less than 1% of people who browse the web with a phone that only does html / css
[13:21:55] <rufo> how do I add an element to the dom
[13:24:33] <NoiseEee> $('<div>').appendTo($('#someID'))  and http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/ , rufo
[13:25:43] <og01> little help I might be missing something - what would $('<div />', {text: 'blah'}); do? what is it (its not a selector i guess?) dunno what to look for
[13:28:53] <faraway> og01: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[13:29:31] <og01> faraway: thanks
[13:39:10] <ejcweb> I'm creating an element ( $('<img>') ) and want to get the html for it as a string. How do I do this?
[13:39:34] <NoiseEee> ejcweb: what do you mean "get the html for it"
[13:39:39] <johnkpaul> ?html @ejcweb
[13:39:53] <faraway> ejcweb: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[13:41:45] <shoky> also $('<img>')[0].outerHTML if you want the img tag included
[13:43:12] <shoky> unless you care about people on old firefox
[13:43:19] <ejcweb> shoky: Yeah, that's what I was looking for. Is that the only way?
[13:43:31] <ejcweb> How old FF?
[13:43:40] <shoky> ejcweb: you can also append it to a container and get the container's html()
[13:43:52] <shoky> ejcweb: since FF 11 (march 2012)
[13:45:40] <ejcweb> shoky: So I could just create a dummy parent, append it, and then call html() of the parent?
[13:45:52] <ejcweb> Seems kind of messy.
[13:46:22] <shoky> yeah, and you'd need to .clone() your img if you don't want to actually append it anywhere
[13:46:30] <shoky> there's no prettier way afaik
[13:46:43] <ejcweb> Like this: $('div').append($('<img>', { src : avatar_src })).html() ?
[13:46:56] <faraway> ejcweb: $("<div/>"). ….
[13:47:02] <shoky> ^^
[13:47:03] <shoky> yes
[13:47:25] <ejcweb> But clone() instead of append?
[13:47:38] <anli__> Too bad I cannot pass an integer to .index setting the childs new position
[13:47:39] <shoky> no
[13:47:52] <shoky> if you don't care about the img being appended then just leave it like that
[13:48:12] <ejcweb> the alternative being?
[13:48:26] <shoky> if you do then:  var i = $('<img/>',...);  $('<div/>').append( i.clone() ).html()
[13:48:33] <faraway> ejcweb: you could also think of extending all pre ff 11  with the outerHtml property using __defineGetter__
[13:52:25] <shoky> anli__:  myElement.siblings(selector).eq(6).after(myElement)
[13:52:51] <anli__> Yeah, but div.index(6) would also be cool
[13:53:08] <shoky> should be easy to make that work, go for it ;P
[13:53:09] <anli__> Must it be detached before inserting?
[13:53:14] <shoky> no
[13:53:21] <anli__> I only reorder
[13:53:33] <anli__> No, I mean that it would be cool if the feature already existed
[13:53:35] <shoky> doing it like i showed should work fine, i think
[13:54:04] <shoky> you can make it exist and a moment later it will have been already existent
[13:54:20] <shoky> then add some unit tests and send a pull request
[13:55:14] <anli__> Maybe you think it would already had existing if I do that, but there is no logic in that
[13:55:20] <anli__> ;)
[13:55:24] <anli__> But maybe I give it a shot
[13:55:27] <shoky> why not ;P
[13:56:50] <Einzig> Hello. I am trying to make every border of an empty textarea red. But it only works on the first one. Does anyone know why? an alert shows it does iterate over both. http://jsbin.com/uxukof/14/edit
[13:57:52] <anli__> shoky: hm, I do a git pull on https://github.com/jquery/jquery then I edit and then?
[13:57:56] <anli__> Its read only
[13:58:41] <anli__> Oh, could not even git pull that
[13:59:50] <shoky> anli__: you fork it, first
[14:00:00] <shoky> and read the contrib guide(s)
[14:00:02] <ryanneufeld> Einzig: you're returning false
[14:00:03] <anli__> ah, git fork url?
[14:00:43] <shoky> i forked it on github site..
[14:00:45] <ryanneufeld> Einzig: Actually, that's not why it's failing, <textarea id="leeg"> </textarea>
[14:00:48] <stuffmc> Hi
[14:00:58] <ryanneufeld> Einzig:  you have a space, so... it's technically not empty
[14:01:27] <ryanneufeld> Einzig: http://jsbin.com/uxukof/17/edit
[14:01:31] <anli__> done fork
[14:01:31] <stuffmc> I have code running in the console working but when added to the page it doesn't
[14:01:31] <stuffmc> kinda weird
[14:01:31] <stuffmc> a click handler
[14:01:54] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: are you using document ready callback?
[14:02:09] <stuffmc> http://pastebin.com/7h16Qyuu
[14:02:17] <anli__> cloning
[14:02:18] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use fullcalendar?
[14:02:21] <stuffmc> pretty simple
[14:02:33] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: that's not enough contect
[14:02:38] <ryanneufeld> ?ready @stuffmc
[14:02:39] <stuffmc> I guess
[14:02:42] <stuffmc> yeah
[14:02:55] <ryanneufeld> ?ready()
[14:03:01] <someprimetime> is gaben in here?
[14:03:04] <Einzig> ryanneufeld: thank you ! But I still have to return false if it is empty, so that it does not get commited. How can I solve that?
[14:03:05] <ryanneufeld> nooooooo bot-t
[14:03:13] <someprimetime> gaben newell
[14:03:16] <ryanneufeld> Einzig: you can keep return false
[14:03:17] <someprimetime> paging gaben newell
[14:03:32] <ryanneufeld> Einzig: you just have to not have spaces between the html tags, they DO matter
[14:03:34] <someprimetime> he's using jquery for half-life 3 if you didn't know
[14:03:57] <stuffmc> ok fixed
[14:04:00] <shoky> Einzig: your 'var status  = true' also should be outside the loop..
[14:04:04] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: see this http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:04:04] <stuffmc> I keep on forgetting
[14:04:11] <stuffmc> using handlebar
[14:04:25] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: how on earth would I have known that?
[14:04:55] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: when asking for help, the entire context of the problem is needed. Sometimes the problem isn't where it seems to be
[14:05:03] <stuffmc> so until I call handlebars.templates JS doesn't have the whole DOM
[14:05:06] <stuffmc> yeah I would/should have mention
[14:05:06] <stuffmc> sorry :)
[14:05:12] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: no
[14:05:15] <ryanneufeld> that's not right
[14:05:35] <ryanneufeld> you're binding your click handler before the document is ready
[14:05:43] <ryanneufeld> which is why it's not working
[14:05:48] <anli__> shoky: I go for manipulation.js
[14:05:53] <stuffmc> I'm not
[14:06:02] <stuffmc> It's in $(document).ready(function () {
[14:06:04] <shoky> anli__: ok
[14:06:22] <stuffmc> anyhow… working now… thanks.
[14:06:24] <Deele> Please, anyone familiar with this, help me. Is there a special way to make .load(iframeLoadCallback) work inside $.fn.extend({ myfunction: function() { var newIframe = $('<iframe/>').load(iframeLoadCallback); var iframeLoadCallback = function() { ... } } }); ?
[14:06:32] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: oh... so the buttons aren't created till your handlebars template is parsed
[14:06:34] <anli__> oh, it was traversing.js, almost there :)
[14:06:38] <ryanneufeld> that makes sense
[14:06:57] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: http://api.jquery.com/on/ check that out
[14:06:57] <Einzig> shoky thanks. I'll use regex to solve the space problem.
[14:07:05] <shoky> Einzig: .trim()
[14:07:07] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: you *can* bind before they exist
[14:07:17] <Einzig> ah, handy
[14:07:44] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });  for example
[14:11:27] <stuffmc> ryanneufeld: cool — good to know. don't really need it here though… but definitely useful
[14:14:36] <cambazz> hello, can json-sans-eval and json2.js be used at the same time?
[14:15:18] <faraway> cambazz: think so
[14:15:56] <cambazz> i am having some problems with IE7 not accepting JSON.stringify - so this is someone elses code
[14:16:19] <cambazz> and in one page, both json_sans_eval and json2.js is included
[14:16:56] <anli__> shoky: hm, but I dunno if I have done it right :) http://pastebin.com/gvbBTCsC
[14:17:03] <anli__> return this in the end of the function?
[14:17:51] <anli__> oh, used elem in the wrong way
[14:19:00] <cambazz> so i am using jsonParse() and JSON.stringfy - and i have IE7 users. what do i do
[14:19:47] <dabear> ?json2 @ cambazz
[14:20:16] <dabear> https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/ @ cambazz
[14:23:36] <cambazz> dabear: thank you. i just could not figure out whether to use json2 or json_parse.js
[14:30:58] <nmeagher> I need some help with using fadeIn with addClass
[14:31:55] <nmeagher> http://jsbin.com/ikinuh/1/
[14:32:19] <nmeagher> Instead of it just toggling I want it to fade into the other class, how can I do this?
[14:35:29] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/vUNaXKpy <-- any familiar with ajax/json... after datatype:'json'; i added data: {},  is this correct?
[14:37:41] <some_dude> http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/PYDWx/4/ why is 'footer text' not aligned to center properly? how to align it to center in a relative way(when a window is resized it should be centered) ?
[14:38:14] <faraway> axscode: it is a normal object and order of properties do no matter !?
[14:38:22] <anli__> If I clone jquery from the git repo, what do I put in the script tag to test stuff? :)
[14:39:43] <faraway> some_dude: cause the left of the footer div is centered and not the div (or content) itself
[14:41:42] <some_dude> faraway: I see. how do I center the content then?
[14:43:00] <nmeagher> hello?
[14:43:44] <faraway> some_dude: thats a css question and not js, and depends on different factors (how to center, which doctype, …) so make a more clear example and ask in a css channel. generally margin left and right auto and/or text-align center will do the trick
[14:44:33] <some_dude> faraway: cheers, will ask there. margins and text align don't work with absolute position tho
[14:46:17] <faraway> some_dude: not directly (absolute conner can have width 100% and content div the margin), anyway as i said it depends on what you want to achieve.
[14:46:31] <faraway> conner = container
[14:47:33] <some_dude> faraway:  I want to have the footer text centered and in a relative way so it doesn't get screwed up on window resize.
[14:49:24] <some_dude> man I hate css...
[14:49:33] <faraway> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/PYDWx/6/ but this will not work for all cases.
[14:50:17] <Benton> css is rad
[14:50:27] <mehrdad> l hate small bakspace keys argh
[14:50:34] <LindsayMac> some_dude:  you are asking the same question in a million places at once..
[14:50:39] <faraway> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/PYDWx/10/
[14:50:40] <LindsayMac> rad is rad
[14:50:55] <some_dude> faraway: thanks a lot man. no idea why text align didn't work before Oo
[14:51:15] <Benton> any thoughts on why <%= @user.first.name %> wouldn't work? I changed the url to reflect the permalink
[14:51:31] <Benton> whoops.. <%= @user.first_name %>
[14:51:52] <gnarf> Benton: ?
[14:51:54] <faraway> some_dude: if you don't see the difference, then it's really your problem ;)
[14:52:12] <nmeagher> Why did you have them in <p> tags?
[14:52:18] <Benton> yes is.. total newb status goin gon
[14:52:45] <faraway> ^^
[14:52:54] <gnarf> Benton: <%= %> seems like some server side language, or a templating language
[14:53:06] <gnarf> but i dunno which, or what relevance it has to jquery
[14:53:08] <Benton> okay thanks @gnarf
[14:53:15] <Benton> rails
[14:53:19] <gnarf> erb?
[14:53:30] <Benton> just though I would throw it out there. yeserb
[14:53:33] <Benton> yes erb
[14:53:34] <nmeagher> I need help making addClass fadeIn, here is my code: http://jsbin.com/ikinuh/1
[14:53:45] <gnarf> Benton: yeah sorry, this isn't #rails ;)
[14:54:04] <nmeagher> Sorry this is this link: http://jsbin.com/ikinuh/1/edit
[14:54:23] <nmeagher> Instead of toggling I want it to toggle with a fade
[14:54:38] <nmeagher> I know I could do this with jQuery-UI but I wanted to see if there was a way to do it without it..
[14:54:39] <faraway> mehrdad: http://jqueryui.com/docs/switchClass/
[14:55:05] <faraway> woos wrong tab completion
[14:55:15] <nmeagher> Is there a way to do it without jQuery-UI?
[14:55:20] <mehrdad> was wondering that
[14:55:22] <faraway> nmeagher: you need query-ui or just another plugin
[14:55:31] <LindsayMac> ugh that jsbin crashed my browser!
[14:57:00] <gnarf> nmeagher: http://jsbin.com/ikinuh/2/ ?
[14:57:26] <gnarf> nmeagher: jQuery-UI effects core has animated add/removeClass
[14:57:35] <gnarf> nmeagher: you don't need all of UI, just effects core
[14:57:52] <gnarf> which also includes color, easing and a few other useful things
[14:57:54] <nmeagher> So you did that with CSS?
[14:58:03] <gnarf> nmeagher: but yeah, simple css works way better
[14:58:10] <gnarf> and who cares if old IE doesn't get the animation
[14:58:14] <gnarf> everyone who matters does
[14:58:14] <nmeagher> hm I didn't know you could do it that way
[14:58:22] <nmeagher> haha true..
[15:00:02] <nmeagher> So there's no way to make that effect with just jQuery?
[15:00:09] <gnarf> nmeagher: http://css3please.com/#box_transition
[15:00:14] <mehrdad> LindsayMac: i can't even reproduce the problem here http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/14/
[15:00:17] <mehrdad> :(
[15:00:23] <gnarf> nmeagher: using css3 + jquery - sure
[15:00:30] <gnarf> you can still do it as addclass/removeclass
[15:00:50] <gnarf> nmeagher: also, you could just .animate() the class properties
[15:00:54] <gnarf> which is all jquery ui doesn
[15:01:11] <nmeagher> ah okay, Im reading up on the link you sent
[15:01:53] <gnarf> nmeagher: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L729-802
[15:02:04] <gnarf> nmeagher: thats how you do it with just jQuery ;)
[15:02:44] <nmeagher> Oh okay :)
[15:02:46] <gnarf> nmeagher: ^^^ or at least thats how I did it with just jQuery
[15:02:51] <nmeagher> Thank you!
[15:03:09] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blame/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L729-802
[15:03:14] <nmeagher> So you think the safest bet is CSS?
[15:03:42] <gnarf> nmeagher: yup
[15:03:47] <mehrdad> LindsayMac: can you tell me why  both divs animate ? it's pretty similar setup to my main problem, but the jsfiddle just hurts my eyes
[15:03:49] <nmeagher> awesome, thank you!
[15:04:36] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  what divs? What are you telling me to look at?
[15:05:35] <mehrdad> LindsayMac: can't you see them? http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/16/
[15:05:46] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  you didnt post that link
[15:06:01] <LindsayMac> what's the problem?
[15:06:17] <mehrdad> seriously, i did post it above
[15:06:32] <LindsayMac> they both animate because they are both called .caption and your code is telling it to animate anything with .caption
[15:06:36] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  not to me..
[15:06:38] <mehrdad> don't both divs animate in your case when you hover on one of them?
[15:07:01] <mehrdad> i'm telling it to animate on hover
[15:07:09] <mehrdad> i hover on one div with that caption
[15:07:34] <mehrdad> see what i mean?
[15:08:18] <Zzaichik> $(this).children('.caption').hide();
[15:08:29] <LindsayMac> you should use children
[15:08:39] <LindsayMac> Zzaichik:  beat me to it
[15:08:57] <Zzaichik> lol barely. :)
[15:08:58] <mehrdad> i swear in my local set up i use this same code and hovering on one doesn't animate others
[15:09:13] <mehrdad> but ok, i'll try that :/
[15:11:32] <Deele> Please, anyone familiar with this, help me. Is there a special way to make .load(iframeLoadCallback) work inside $.fn.extend({ myfunction: function() { var newIframe = $('<iframe/>').load(iframeLoadCallback); var iframeLoadCallback = function() { ... } } }); ?
[15:11:36] <mehrdad> LindsayMac: still broken
[15:11:46] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  post your code
[15:12:00] <mehrdad> http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/17/
[15:12:29] <mehrdad> i am even not that good at jquery and i know that my code was correct in selecting the right child element
[15:12:53] <gnarf> Deele: declare it before you use it?
[15:12:58] <mehrdad> for one thing i know my local code doesn't have that problem
[15:13:06] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  you said that your local code is not the same..
[15:13:12] <gnarf> Deele: when you use var xxxx = function() {}; its not assigned to "xxxx" until that line executes
[15:13:16] <LindsayMac> so why debug entirely different code?
[15:13:24] <mehrdad> the jquery is exactly the same
[15:13:26] <gnarf> thats why you use function statements instead of function expressions, function statements are hoisted
[15:13:38] <LindsayMac> mehrdad:  something is different if it's not acting the same
[15:13:50] <mehrdad> i was trying to reproduce my main problem and faced another along the way :/
[15:13:50] <gnarf> mehrdad: so now we solve two problems? the bug in your demo, and the bug in your code?
[15:14:07] <mehrdad> what's wrong with the demo
[15:14:13] <Deele> gnarf so I should use ordinary function iframeLoadCallback(e) {...} ?
[15:14:30] <mehrdad> maybe that leads me in the right direction to solve my main problem
[15:14:33] <LindsayMac> as you said.. its not the same as your local code..
[15:14:44] <gnarf> Deele: or declare the callback before you assign it to the load handler... i just use function statements instead of function expressions
[15:14:46] <mehrdad> ok, THAT is my problem
[15:14:54] <gnarf> i always hated the look of "var xxxx = function() {}"
[15:15:01] <mehrdad> why both animate?
[15:15:28] <Deele> gnarf I don't know, why I'm using it, saw it in another code and tried now :)
[15:16:08] <gnarf> mehrdad: both animate because you leave one and enter the other
[15:16:12] <gnarf> try hovering from the bottom
[15:16:54] <gnarf> mehrdad: also, why don't you take the time to make the html and the css and the js actually readable...
[15:16:58] <mehrdad> gnarf: what? hover from bottom makes no diff
[15:17:28] <gnarf> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/18/
[15:17:36] <mehrdad> is that it?
[15:17:48] <gnarf> mehrdad: is what it?
[15:18:03] <mehrdad> never mind....
[15:18:34] <gnarf> mehrdad: i formatted it
[15:18:36] <gnarf> now i can read it
[15:18:38] <Zzaichik> mehrdad: you are triggering both hover events with each mouse over.
[15:18:39] <mehrdad> both animate
[15:18:39] <gnarf> please describe the issue
[15:18:49] <mehrdad> it was readable
[15:18:55] <ShaunR> in order to use .reset() does a reset button have to exist?
[15:19:25] <mehrdad> anyway... the issue is that both divs animate on hovering one
[15:19:31] <Zzaichik> mouseenter = hiding div. in hiding div you create a mouseleave event.
[15:21:06] <Whirl3d> do you have to use the fx queue with delay? I would like to do my animations with queue:false, but I rely on delay to cycle the images
[15:21:06] <mehrdad> Zzaichik: thanks, that's it.
[15:21:19] <gnarf> mehrdad: "both divs"
[15:21:20] <gnarf> there are 4
[15:21:22] <uSMS> i'm using fadeToggle for overlay boxes, but I only want to toggle the overlay box div, not its children also. how can I do that?
[15:21:46] <mehrdad> the obvious colored divs in the result area duh
[15:21:49] <gnarf> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/20/ -- it feels like the outer container needs a height, because as you hover one, it is hidden, then immediately no loger hovered, so the other animates
[15:22:19] <gnarf> mehrdad: in other words, the fact that you hide the inner content is making the outer thing no longer the target of the mouse
[15:22:34] <gnarf> mehrdad: console.log() is your friend here...
[15:22:55] <mehrdad> ok, now my main problem that led me to create this testcase, is kinda the reverse, let prepare it now
[15:23:11] <cambazz> hello, i finally corrected the IE7 json problem. but now i have another problem where jquery 1.4.4 and jquery.form-2.36 wont work with IE7. it is strange because, it will give no errors, and will make the ajax form post, but not with variables.
[15:23:32] <mehrdad> gnarf: no, actually i am kinda tired and not paying attention, Zzaichik nailed it nicely
[15:23:55] <Zzaichik> ;)
[15:24:10] <mehrdad> i reversed my main problem in this demo and didn't care what was chaged in effect
[15:24:23] <mehrdad> changed*
[15:24:55] * gnarf shrugs
[15:24:55] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:25:21] <eizdealer> hey guys, quick question: if <input class="bla"> gets focus, the parent's next sibling should become visible. i tried: $(".item input").focus(function(eventObject){   $(eventObject).$(":last-child").css("visibility","visible");   });
[15:25:31] <eizdealer> but this results in an error :/
[15:25:35] <eizdealer> how would i do this?
[15:26:06] <eizdealer> sorry, the input's class is of course .item not .bla
[15:26:18] <Zzaichik> This example makes the problem very obvious. http://jsfiddle.net/LQCAz/23/ Just drag the mouse around on one .caption div and it flickers like crazy. Because both hover states are being triggered by itself.
[15:26:18] <gnarf> eizdealer: um
[15:26:39] <shoky> $.fn.$ ftw
[15:27:07] <gnarf> eizdealer: of course thats an error, you probably want $(this).parent().next().show();
[15:27:18] <gnarf> eizdealer: dont use "visibility" unless you really want visibility
[15:27:34] <eizdealer> ok gnarf thanks!! will try
[15:27:35] <gnarf> display: none; and display: block(or inline, or whatever); are better
[15:27:42] <gnarf> also
[15:27:50] <gnarf> .show() and .hide() in jQuery
[15:28:00] <gnarf> use display:
[15:28:12] <uSMS> i'm using fadeToggle for overlay boxes, but I only want to toggle the overlay box div, but the children get toggled too :( how can i stop that
[15:28:45] <gnarf> uSMS: make the children not be children of the overlay
[15:28:58] <gnarf> uSMS: fading anything fades is children....
[15:29:06] <gnarf> thats just the way it works
[15:29:26] <uSMS> oh, wow i forgot i could just make another div below
[15:29:30] <gnarf> if something is 80% opacity, all of its children are 80% of their opacity....
[15:30:34] <chee> ;//
[15:30:49] <some_dude> got this login form http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/pU2mf/ and I use $.post to give data to a php script to check it in database. if the login is sucessful the php should switch to another .html page but using header('Location: html_file.html') from php screws up completely. I get the page output in the dialog box all over the current box Oo
[15:31:44] <gnarf> ;//P
[15:31:56] <gnarf> thats my noop smily
[15:32:36] <gnarf> some_dude: your ajax request follows the redirect
[15:32:59] <some_dude> gnarf:  and that means?
[15:33:23] <gnarf> some_dude: hard to say without seeing the code that does the $.post also
[15:33:30] <some_dude> sec
[15:34:06] <gnarf> some_dude: but, the "return value" of the post will be the html from html_file.html
[15:34:08] <gnarf> or it should be
[15:34:08] <eizdealer> gnarf: there seems to be a problem with $(this) - $(this).parent().parent().innerHTML returns "undefined" for example...
[15:34:24] <gnarf> eizdealer: of course it does, jQuery objects don't have an innerHTML property
[15:34:31] <gnarf> they have an .html() function
[15:34:46] <gnarf> or they have an [0] to return a DOMElement, and you could [0].innerHTML
[15:35:03] <gnarf> also, .parent().parent() probably not a good idea
[15:35:11] <gnarf> use .closest( ".someSelector" )
[15:35:21] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/closest http://api.jquery.com/html
[15:35:25] <gnarf> eizdealer: ^^^^^
[15:35:32] <eizdealer> ok thx!
[15:36:48] <some_dude> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/fTcAj4dp
[15:37:09] <gnarf> some_dude: thats not the code that deals with the $.post
[15:37:13] <gnarf> at least thats php code
[15:37:16] <gnarf> not jquery code
[15:37:25] <gnarf> some_dude: if you are literally submitting a form, of course it changes pages
[15:37:40] <gnarf> i figured you had a ajax submit happening
[15:37:45] <some_dude> gnarf: the jquery code is in the fiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/pU2mf/
[15:38:06] <gnarf> also really --- plaintext password field without a salt?
[15:38:07] <some_dude> oh shit i forgot to include it sry :D
[15:39:54] <cambazz> hello, i have statements like <input id="acpositif" class="selr" type="radio" name="afeedback" value="POSITIVE"></input> .. for each positive, negative etc, and IE7 / form & validate plugins will not read from the radio box. it will read and work with just text input but not radio boxes. i think it has something to do with my notation
[15:40:28] <some_dude> gnarf:  is it a good idea to pass the html doc name from my php script and have jquery run it?
[15:40:57] <cambazz> the notation is more like : <input id="acpositif" class="selr" type="radio" name="afeedback" value="POSITIVE"></input><label for="acpositif">Pozitif</label>
[15:41:06] <some_dude> gnarf: here's the updated code http://jsfiddle.net/zlikowsky/pU2mf/1/
[15:41:11] <shoky> cambazz: the only thing that could be wrong with your html there is the </input>
[15:41:25] <shoky> otherwise it's fine (and probably the </input> isn't the problem)
[15:42:49] <gnarf> shoky: </input> ? what crack are you smokin
[15:42:55] <gnarf> input tags don't have a closing tag
[15:43:07] <shoky> that's what i'm saying
[15:43:10] <gnarf> oh
[15:43:14] <gnarf> he HAS them
[15:43:23] <gnarf> i read that backwards
[15:43:24] <gnarf> sorry
[15:43:30] <shoky> heh :P
[15:43:39] <gnarf> cambazz: you're the one smokin crack then
[15:43:46] <gnarf> don't close input tags ;)
[15:43:57] <gnarf> they are like <br> or <hr>, etc... they don't have a closing tag
[15:44:59] <cambazz> well I got rid of them
[15:45:06] <cambazz> still the same error
[15:45:35] <gnarf> some_dude: so
[15:45:50] <gnarf> some_dude: in your processData --- "data" will be the contents of html_file.html
[15:46:00] <gnarf> think about what that does when you inject it like that
[15:46:13] <gnarf> the ajax request FOLLOWS the redirect
[15:46:22] <gnarf> so the data = the html file
[15:46:46] <some_dude> gnarf: yes got that the returned data is the actual html and it gets crammed into the dialog. how do I run it properly tho?
[15:47:00] <gnarf> some_dude: don't redirect
[15:47:57] <gnarf> some_dude: instead return something like {"success": true, "goto": "html_file.html"}
[15:47:59] <cambazz> i mean it will work in ff or chrome, but only IE7, it wont read the correct radio box data
[15:48:30] <shoky> cambazz: then it's coming from something else
[15:49:00] <shoky> cause.. IE7 knows radio buttons
[15:49:02] <gnarf> some_dude: usually when doing a login via an ajax request - you want to make a different "endpoint"
[15:49:19] <gnarf> some_dude: an "authentication api" of sorts
[15:50:17] <ShaunR> anybody tell me whats wrong with this? $('#my_form').reset();
[15:50:34] <gnarf> ShaunR: .reset() isn't a jQuery function?
[15:50:36] <ShaunR> I have a <form id="myform"></form>
[15:50:40] <shoky> ShaunR: you probably want $('#my_form')[0].reset()
[15:50:43] <some_dude> gnarf: question, how do I protect the html_file.html from access by someone just typing it in the browser without going through my php login routine?
[15:50:57] <some_dude> gnarf: thanks for help btw, I will try the json return
[15:51:05] <gnarf> shoky: ShaunR: or even document.getElementById( "my_form" ).reset() ;)
[15:51:12] <shoky> indeed
[15:51:20] <gnarf> some_dude: you dont - you make it be served by a php
[15:51:29] <gnarf> some_dude: if you need to check session data
[15:51:39] <gnarf> some_dude: otherwise, you are just pretending to be secure
[15:51:47] <gnarf> kinda like your plain text passwords in that mysql database
[15:51:49] <gnarf> pretend
[15:51:57] <some_dude> hehe
[15:52:00] <gnarf> authentication is not a simple thing
[15:54:18] <some_dude> well it's just a testing example I didn't use any hashing or anything
[15:55:17] <some_dude> what do you mean served by php? should I echo the html straight from php?
[15:55:36] <gnarf> some_dude: <? include("require_user.php"); ?>
[15:55:51] <gnarf> some_dude: then in require_user and your login script you can use $_SESSION to store that the user is logged in
[15:56:09] <gnarf> and if they aren't you can echo your "access denied" and exit;
[15:56:41] <gnarf> give it a .php extension instead of a .html extension
[15:56:48] <gnarf> and suddenly you have a "protected" thing
[15:58:11] <Crimlo> sup mofos
[15:58:17] <some_dude> aaah yes, thanks a bunch. how stupid I am.. :D
[15:59:38] <Crimlo> very stupid
[16:05:07] <gnarf> Crimlo: NO U!
[16:05:27] <Crimlo> excuse me?
[16:06:15] * gnarf shrugs
[16:06:16] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:06:26] * gnarf points at ajpiano and runs off
[16:08:47] <Crimlo> what is with that guy?

[16:38:05] <shoky> mehrdad: what?
[16:39:43] <citric> What would cause jQuery(function($) { ... }); not to run?
[16:40:07] <mehrdad> hey shoky, thanks god you answered. see the blue divs in the test case get stuck when you hover between them quickly
[16:40:16] <shoky> mehrdad: i dont see that
[16:40:23] <mehrdad> it is the test case for the problem i talked about hours back
[16:40:32] <shoky> i dont see anything getting stuck, donno what you mean
[16:43:22] <mehrdad> ah damn, i can't believe i didnt see that in the sea of jsfiddle tabs i have open :/ never mind, another guy solved it for me minutes ago and i noticed only now! thanks anyway :/ at 4:12 AM what do you expect?!

[16:52:20] <shoky> even without
[17:05:21] <sunbeam> when i do this, $(".navigation-items li a").click(function() { } )  .. $(this) in this function should work as the current item being clicked right?
[17:06:51] <tw2113> didja try it?
[17:07:16] <marwan_> hi, any one familiar with the DataTables plugin
[17:07:36] <sunbeam> tw2113: yes and it doesnt work
[17:10:24] <tw2113> running it in a WP install and console.logging $(this) and it's showing the slug for the link
[17:10:39] <sunbeam> ok
[17:11:13] <tw2113> $('#menu-primary li a').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); console.log($(this)); });
[17:11:57] <sunbeam> yep found it thanks
[17:12:09] <sunbeam> whats li a its parent li, how can i find it with .parent() right?
[17:13:08] <tw2113> worth a shot
[17:17:06] <marwan_> hi, any one familiar with the DataTables plugin
[17:29:31] <cincinnatus> I'm building an app with jquery and Twitter Bootstrap. Can someone recommend an html template system (like Moustache, Handlebars, etc)?

[17:37:55] <lcj> css ::-webkit-scrollbar problem in Safari - I would like to apply it with jQuery, but the selector $('::-webkit-scrollbar') does not fly (or maybe jQ is just new to me): http://jsfiddle.net/lasseclaes/DjgZq/
[17:38:24] <lcj> and http://jsfiddle.net/lasseclaes/DjgZq/1/ as I would like it to be (with CSS)
[17:40:50] <shoky> lcj: you can only select elements in the DOM
[17:41:07] <lcj> shoky - so it can't be done?
[17:41:19] <shoky> i dont know, but i doubt it very much
[17:41:40] <lcj> shoky - all right thanks for looking at it
[17:43:17] <cincinnatus> jedimind, tw2113: thanks
[17:44:16] * tw2113 was sarcastic
[17:45:53] <LindsayMac> I can't seem to find info on how to open a fancybox gallery from a single link..
[17:46:27] <LindsayMac> Do i just have a list of images with a rel="gallery" and a link that goes to #gallyer?
[17:48:43] <jedimind> LindsayMac, when you include fancybox, you have to initialize it with a selector of your choice
[17:48:50] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  i know this..
[17:49:07] <LindsayMac> I just didnt see anything on how to group elements to be a gallery with only one link to them
[17:49:15] <LindsayMac> but i think i got it.. just have to workout the php code now
[17:49:54] <tw2113> which version of fancybox?
[17:51:23] <jedimind> oh, single element trigger for a gallery
[17:51:25] <jedimind> got it, i misread
[17:51:34] <tw2113> victory is me!
[17:51:42] <jedimind> its been you all along?
[17:52:03] <tw2113> ..........yes
[17:52:05] <tw2113> *flies away*
[17:57:39] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  does that make sense now?
[18:05:17] <lcj> shoky (or others) could something like this work: http://jsfiddle.net/lasseclaes/DjgZq/2/? - [[[$('head').append.('<style type="text/css">...]]]
[18:06:27] <lcj> right now it does not, think I need to escape some characters (semicolon, curly brackets?) - which and how ? Or will it not get to work for some reason?
[18:14:43] <shoky> lcj it would be like this http://jsfiddle.net/DjgZq/5/
[18:15:10] <shoky> that adds it to <head> successfully, but it has no effect
[18:18:29] <LindsayMac> ok i'm stuck.. how do i open a "gallery" of <div> containers with one link?
[18:19:01] <LindsayMac> Ahh all answers point to PRETTYPHOTO
[18:19:06] <LindsayMac> which was my original choice..
[18:19:07] <LindsayMac> grrr
[18:19:09] <tw2113> http://fancybox.net/howto
[18:19:40] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  yes.. i read it.. it seems all the groups have to do with images..
[18:21:06] <lcj> yeah shoky - I just tried it , it has no effect as you said - thanks for trying it out though
[18:21:32] <defaultro> is jslint for troubleshooting jquery?
[18:21:37] <tw2113> no
[18:21:44] <defaultro> oh
[18:21:58] <drz> can someone help me setup checkboxes for hiding columns using jquery?
[18:22:23] <defaultro> use click event the hide on columns
[18:22:25] <drz> its not hiding
[18:22:36] <defaultro> reference it to proper id or class
[18:23:03] <tw2113> jslint = javascript quality checking, by Douglas Crockford's standards
[18:23:16] <defaultro> thanks tw2113
[18:23:47] <defaultro> i really want to learn how to debug jquery events. I want to know what javascript file is handling the click events on our app
[18:24:01] <defaultro> i tried Visual Event but it doesn't say which js file it is
[18:24:38] <defaultro> the reason I want to do that is because so that I can put a breakpoint and step over it line by line
[18:24:53] <tw2113> i'd say just use the browser tools that you should be using...firebug/chrome inspector
[18:25:38] <drz> ah i give up :/
[18:26:11] <drz> im going to have to write a greasemonkey to add div ids to this entire page
[18:26:21] <drz> work trouble ticket page
[18:27:04] <drz> the page already uses jquery, could it be interfering?
[18:29:20] <defaultro> k
[18:29:56] <tw2113> drz what are you trying again?
[18:30:37] <drz> i want to hide columns from a trouble ticket type page using checkboxes
[18:30:47] <RohanBhangui> hi guys
[18:30:49] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/R26Mj/1/
[18:30:51] <RohanBhangui> ^
[18:31:03] <RohanBhangui> my problem is that wehn i do a mouse enter
[18:31:08] <RohanBhangui> the item animates
[18:31:16] <drz> once i get it working on a static html
[18:31:18] <RohanBhangui> but what i want it to do is switch between two images
[18:31:39] <drz> im going to write a greasemonkey to add the code to every page
[18:31:47] <RohanBhangui> two images being the ones that are in css class logo
[18:31:54] <RohanBhangui> and logohover
[18:32:17] <drz> ive never done anything like this so, excuse my noob
[18:33:02] <RohanBhangui> who me?
[18:33:13] <RohanBhangui> oh also i want to use hover if possible
[18:33:36] <RohanBhangui> cause when i use mouseenter and mouseleave it does this wierd wthing when i smap it that it keeps going
[18:33:52] <RohanBhangui> tw2113: any help? (since i know your boss :)
[18:34:07] <tw2113> since when?
[18:34:19] <RohanBhangui> youve helped me a few times
[18:34:24] <RohanBhangui> in tight situations
[18:34:29] <tw2113> doesn't mean i know anything
[18:34:49] <RohanBhangui> i know but this is simpler comared to things tha tyou have helped me wiht in the past
[18:37:49] <drz> if i sent someone the file, could they fix my checkboxes? is that against the rules
[18:38:30] <RohanBhangui> lol send a jsfiddle
[18:38:32] <RohanBhangui> link
[18:38:38] <RohanBhangui> or if too big i guess
[18:39:11] <drz> yea its big
[18:39:23] <drz> and it has a lot of dependent js's
[18:40:33] <lcj> shoky -  http://jsfiddle.net/DjgZq/5/ throws an - Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL - I think something some characters should be escaped - just don't know which (::, curly brackets, semicolon) and how to do it?
[18:47:23] <coldhead> lcj: it's better not to have CSS in your JS
[18:47:34] <LindsayMac> ok i'm lost.. anyone know how to open multiple images in fancybox from ONE link?
[18:47:47] <coldhead> it's better to put the CSS in your CSS, with some kind of class on body to match it
[18:48:51] <defaultro> hey guys, I'm tired with the other developer. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong. My teammate tells me to not update our env directly. I believe that. It's because it's in svn. He told me that everytime I change something, do it in svn then create a tag. However, there is another developer(backend) today, he asked me 5 times today, to change an url.
[18:48:52] <coldhead> so like .safari ::webkit-scrollbar {etc}; and then $('html').addClass('safari') in your JS
[18:51:12] <zorph> LindsayMac, just use same rel="" on each gallery image...then link to the image in the href..
[18:51:30] <LindsayMac> zorph:  but I dont want them to show on the page.. that doesn't work..
[18:51:35] <LindsayMac> Im working up a fiddle now
[18:52:06] <zorph> so how do you wanna link to the image? without showing a thumb..
[18:53:49] <zorph> defaultro, that's the reality of multiple devs working on code
[18:54:19] <defaultro> k
[18:54:35] <lcj> coldhead - yeah, thanks. I am not sure if that will fly - anyway I came up with a solution inserting it in the head using php instead, and I think that is the best solution.
[18:55:03] <LindsayMac> zorph:  heres my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Cn94A/
[18:55:07] <zorph> although when I make tiny changes I just use -m '' empty message for svn checkins
[18:55:30] <LindsayMac> although I think that you can't launch a lightbox in fiddle
[18:55:45] <coldhead> you're detecting the browser in PHP, lcj ?
[18:56:11] <lcj> coldhead yes
[18:57:23] <LindsayMac> Anyone got a thought on how to open multiple images from one link? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Cn94A/
[18:58:15] <zorph> LindsayMac, what u mean by "multiple images"?   like all the gallery in ONE fancybox?
[18:58:44] <zorph> or the FIRST image, and then clicking will advance to next image..
[18:58:58] <LindsayMac> zorph:  I would like to click ONE link and when I click it, it cycles through multiple images inside the fancybox
[18:59:00] <LindsayMac> one at a time
[18:59:27] <LindsayMac> yes zorph..  click will advance to next image.. basically the same interactions that happen with their "gallery" effect but I only want ONE thumbnail
[18:59:29] <zorph> then link to the first image in the gallery
[19:00:11] <LindsayMac> yes?
[19:01:32] <lcj> shoky - I know it is not jQuery, but that was where we started. Just wanted to share the php-solution. This works: http://jsfiddle.net/lasseclaes/DjgZq/8/. thanks again.
[19:01:53] <felipevieira> I've added new elements to my page dynamicaly using append() but jquery doesn't work on these new elements. Is it normal?
[19:02:09] <shoky> lcj: yes, putting it in the html in the first place works as we saw in your first fiddle
[19:02:47] <shoky> lcj: you sure you can't use coldhead's suggestion of using it in an actual element?
[19:05:41] <lcj> shoky I don't know.  - the selector is a little off "::-web..." Maybe it will work..  anyway I just need it to load for the chrome browser, so no need to adding up where it is not needed
[19:05:43] <defaultro> hey folks, I would like to debug the events on our app. I pressed F12 to bring up Firebug console. I clicked on the image but nothing is happening in console.
[19:06:25] <LindsayMac> apparently i'm not the only one looking for a way to open a lightbox gallery from one link!
[19:06:27] <defaultro> when I click on the image, an infobubble pops up. I wanted to capture what js file does that popping up of infobubble
[19:07:31] <LindsayMac> Hmm i had a thought.. i could do some css hacks where only the first image shows so something like #gallery:first {display:block;} and then #gallery img{display:none;}
[19:12:02] <martisj> morning
[19:18:10] <zorph> LindsayMac, that'll do it :)
[19:18:29] <LindsayMac> zorph:  I am going to test it now.. but i think it's going to work
[19:21:25] <LindsayMac> NoooooooooO!!!!!
[19:21:56] <coldhead> so the test went well?
[19:22:08] <LindsayMac> lol
[19:22:15] <LindsayMac> oops i think it was a typo
[19:22:16] <LindsayMac> take 2
[19:22:28] <LindsayMac> Oh yea..
[19:22:32] * LindsayMac does a dance 
[19:22:43] <LindsayMac> it worked.. but i did it a little differently
[19:22:43] <coldhead> hooray!
[19:22:49] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[19:22:55] <LindsayMac> lol..
[19:23:02] <LindsayMac> sometimes you have to ask the question to get your own answer..
[19:23:09] <LindsayMac> it's happened a couple times to me..
[19:23:36] <LindsayMac> even with wordpress code, which I rarely have issues with these days.. but yea. I think it's also from being overtired
[19:24:47] <LindsayMac> ew fancybox does NOT look good on the iphone..
[19:26:05] <rodd> iphone
[19:26:06] <rodd> ew
[19:26:24] <zorph> uh yah...just use your Swipe js to view image gallery
[19:26:46] <zorph> same way as viewing content, but use images..
[19:27:55] <LindsayMac> zorph:  i dont think i can do a swipe panel within a swipe panel..
[19:28:32] <LindsayMac> but I may try it another day.. for now, this works and it's fine. For now, it's enough to launch it. This wasn't a client project, it was a to learn project..
[19:29:21] <LindsayMac> rodd:  ew on the iphone? How?
[19:29:23] <LindsayMac> why?
[19:29:43] <shoky> defaultro: use the timeline, or you could try http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[19:29:54] <zorph> uh oh..u got her started rodd
[19:30:06] <LindsayMac> No just curious why..
[19:30:08] <zorph> overtired girl with "mac" in her name defending apple
[19:30:25] <rodd> just joking
[19:30:29] <defaultro> shoky, yes, I am using Visual Event but it's not able to tell what really it is
[19:30:53] <shoky> defaultro: timeline will show you what's going on, if you wanna dig in
[19:31:02] <defaultro> timeline in chrome?
[19:31:03] <LindsayMac> Nah.. its only mac in my name because i made the account on my mac...
[19:31:04] <shoky> ya
[19:31:16] <shoky> not always easy to use
[19:31:46] <rodd> thought your middle/last name was mac/mac something
[19:31:47] <defaultro> k
[19:32:29] <LindsayMac> rodd:  you wouldnt be the first person to google LindsayMac and find a girl out there named LindsayMac and think it was me.
[19:32:31] <LindsayMac> thats not me
[19:32:38] <Gates> any suggestions for pulse or shine on button?
[19:32:49] <rodd> ok, didnt google you though
[19:32:55] <LindsayMac> made the account on my mac when I didnt know what IRC was and thought it was tied to the comuter you sign up on
[19:33:08] <Gates> or like gleem
[19:33:20] <LindsayMac> rodd: lol.. haha .. well people have and thinking they were slick trying to be all creepy but I had NO IDEA what they were talking abotu. But anyways. Enough about me.
[19:33:25] <zorph> Gates, flash lol
[19:33:31] <Gates> ./me runs
[19:33:34] <Gates> how dare u
[19:33:58] <zorph> u want to simulate a shimmer using jquery? haha
[19:34:17] <zorph> have fun making that look realistic
[19:34:32] <zorph> animated gif
[19:34:35] <LindsayMac> Ohh ohh i know what you can use!
[19:34:40] <LindsayMac> have you looked at GreenSock.js ?
[19:34:47] <LindsayMac> to make a shimmer
[19:35:10] <LindsayMac> Greensock.js is a tweening engine previously for flash but now they made a js library
[19:35:20] <Gates> like
[19:35:29] <Gates> i have a button that hovers and gets darker using gradients
[19:35:30] <LindsayMac> Gates:  are you familiar?
[19:35:37] <Gates> i was told to do something like that but css3 doesnt support ie9
[19:35:43] <LindsayMac> Gates:  that you can do with CSS
[19:35:47] <Gates> so im trying to find something simular that gets your attension without going crazy
[19:35:51] <Gates> (see last msg)
[19:36:14] <Gates> ill look at GreenSock
[19:36:25] <LindsayMac> Gates:  thats going to be overkill for what you wanna do
[19:36:30] <LindsayMac> I didn tknow you wanted just a button effect.
[19:36:34] <Gates> yea i want simple
[19:36:35] <rodd> how can i work being sleepy and with a concrete block in my intestines
[19:36:39] <LindsayMac> have you seen a website with a similar effect?
[19:36:52] <Gates> i havnt really
[19:36:52] <LindsayMac> rodd:  some colon cleanse for ya?
[19:36:53] <zorph> make an animated gif..and then show it on hover
[19:37:02] <Gates> LindsayMac: i saw a css one let me see
[19:37:09] <rodd> maybe a few punches will do
[19:37:14] <LindsayMac> k
[19:37:30] <amirite> poop
[19:37:42] <LindsayMac> or that
[19:38:00] <Gates> something close to teh pulse demo (mid way down - above comments)
[19:38:02] <Gates> http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/animations/
[19:38:43] <Gates> LindsayMac:  i tried doing this before i realized the lack of IE9 support, http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/jSsZn/56/embedded/result/ - but it doesnt fade it just jumps from 1 to the other.. weird
[19:38:55] <Gates> thats the actual button
[19:39:03] <LindsayMac> Gates: So you just want to fade in and out content on hover?
[19:39:16] <Gates> no just alway
[19:39:20] <Gates> sorry
[19:39:36] <Gates> to draw the attention of the eye to the CTA
[19:39:39] <LindsayMac> Oh just always have it sitting there fading in and out?
[19:40:27] <LindsayMac> Maybe you do want greensock. You can use a timeline and create an "animation" and have it repeat.. which is what you need
[19:41:02] <zorph> good old animated gif...u don't even consider it...haha
[19:41:14] <LindsayMac> I am with zorph on this
[19:41:18] <LindsayMac> that's SIMPLE
[19:41:19] <Gates> it changes a bit with differnt screen sizes zorph
[19:41:25] <Gates> heres the raw, http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/jSsZn/58/embedded/result/
[19:41:31] <Gates> as u see a basic over changes the bg to darker
[19:41:53] <Gates> i like how when u hover and unhover and hover and unhover it almost pulses
[19:42:38] <LindsayMac> Gates:  thats a traditional "hover effect" and that can work on any browser depending on how you code it
[19:42:47] <LindsayMac> its the transitions you want to happen just random
[19:42:57] <Gates> yes
[19:43:21] <LindsayMac> So basically you need to set up a timeline.. you know what an animation timeline is?
[19:43:23] <Gates> i want to take the effect i made for the hover and have it transition
[19:43:23] <rodd> css transitions
[19:43:27] <rodd> #css
[19:43:32] <rodd> no need for js
[19:43:34] <Gates> rodd: it doesnt support IE9
[19:43:44] <rodd> oh, you support IE
[19:43:48] <LindsayMac> rodd:  he wants it to change / pulse colors without any interaction / hover / click
[19:44:03] <Gates> rodd: i know, out of my hands
[19:44:32] <Gates> isnt there a jq solution to have it well animate
[19:44:44] <tw2113> setTimeout?
[19:45:21] <zorph> animated gif...then use a different gif for different screen size  using css @media max-width
[19:45:36] <rodd> maybe a mix of gif and <blink>
[19:45:45] <LindsayMac> I like zorph's idea
[19:46:01] <zorph> just use a <MARQUEE> TAG  ! LOL
[19:46:08] <zorph> good idea no?..
[19:46:16] <zorph> lolss
[19:46:21] <LindsayMac> Gates:  do you know how to do css media queries?
[19:46:28] <Gates> i do
[19:46:47] <rodd> im gonna make a 90s geocities version of every site I work for IE users
[19:46:51] <LindsayMac> Gates:  create your gif in different sizes
[19:46:55] <LindsayMac> i heart gifs
[19:47:23] <Gates> augh i do too
[19:47:30] <Gates> just doesnt seem to be the right thing
[19:47:42] <Gates> cant i just add/remove classes and animation
[19:47:50] <zorph> it allows for the most artistic shimmer
[19:47:55] <zorph> short of using flash
[19:48:09] <zorph> actualy..duh..use flash..then export as animated gif
[19:48:09] <LindsayMac> Gates:  gifs are so in right now.
[19:48:19] <tw2113> LindsayMac does love her gifs
[19:48:21] <zorph> beautiful shine
[19:48:30] <tw2113> she doesn't look a gif horse in the mouth
[19:48:56] <LindsayMac> you're so punny
[19:49:28] <tw2113> naturally
[19:49:46] <rodd> alright poop time
[19:49:49] <Gates> so non gif, jquery solution?
[19:50:16] <LindsayMac> SO just to recap.. if you want to open multiple images with ONE thumbnail or link, you do it by doing one of two things.. Either set the :first element to display: block and the rest display none and go on as if you were making a normal lightbox gallery OR you just make empty <a> tags that href you filename
[19:50:24] <LindsayMac> rodd:  WOO
[19:50:39] <LindsayMac> CSS Transitions dont work on IE9?
[19:51:35] <Gates> nope
[19:51:46] <tw2113> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions
[19:51:55] <tw2113> not even prefixed
[19:52:04] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i'd rather as you guyses
[19:52:04] <tw2113> because IE9 sucks
[19:52:18] <zorph> Gates, then try an animation loop changing the background-color slightly brighter..and then back to the original color
[19:52:28] <zorph> play with the hex code
[19:52:33] <Gates> thats what i dont know how to do it
[19:52:35] <Gates> do*
[19:52:37] <zorph> and animation timings..it may look good
[19:53:10] <LindsayMac> greensock makes timelines easy in javascript
[19:53:14] <LindsayMac> its not jquery though..
[19:54:24] <zorph> make 2 functions...   shine and dim.......each containing an animation on the button.. (with an oncomplete callback calling the other function)
[19:54:40] <zorph> when shine completes...it calls dim...when dim completes...it calls shine
[19:54:48] <Gates> oh an endless call back
[19:54:57] <LindsayMac> hmmm
[19:55:12] <zorph> call shine on document.ready
[19:55:18] <zorph> and you're off to the races
[19:56:52] <Gates> now to remember how to write it lol
[19:57:37] <axscode> hi guys in $.ajax()   i put data: {'name1':'value1', 'name2':}
[19:58:00] <zorph> ya just check the jquery docs animate function
[19:58:16] <zorph> copy paste and play with values...define the 2 functions
[19:58:37] <Gates> kk
[19:58:38] <Gates> thanks
[19:58:40] <codepython777> If a user leaves the mouse on an image, I want to display some details about that image in a popup. Any ideas how to do this?
[19:58:51] <LindsayMac> erm.. i think my text editor is addin g<div> tags into my code. its done it TWICE today and gave me a heart attack
[19:59:04] <Gates> zorph: can i just have it add/remove classes with teh correct styles?
[19:59:04] <tw2113> which editor?
[19:59:21] <axscode> hi guys in $.ajax()   i put data: { 'name1':'value1', 'name2':'value2' } <-- the name using java item.getFieldName() works ok, but item.getString resturns [object Object] <-- any thoughts what i missed?
[19:59:29] <LindsayMac> text wrangler
[20:00:00] <tw2113> codepython777 have a hidden div that's only diplay: block on hover of the parent
[20:00:29] <tw2113> <div class="parent"><img><div class="hidden">Details</div></div>
[20:00:51] <zorph> Gates, no the standard animate doesn't fade from class to class...u could seek a plugin for that perhaps..
[20:00:57] <zorph> just animated css props
[20:01:02] <Gates> ah
[20:01:07] <Gates> well ie9 stupid stupid
[20:01:10] <tw2113> .hidden { display: none; } .parent:hover .hidden { display: block; }
[20:02:24] <zorph> axscode, I think the data params should be  {key:'value',key:'valye'}
[20:02:33] <zorph> keys not strings
[20:02:44] <zorph> but they may be interchangable..I forgot..
[20:03:01] <codepython777> tw2113: is you have a jsfiddle or an example somewhere, that would be lovely.
[20:03:05] <axscode> ok ill try that..
[20:05:40] <Gates> zorph:
[20:05:49] <zorph> yo
[20:06:32] <axscode> zorph: http://pastebin.com/EZd9xA7v <-- var i in data, seems i = name, but what should be the value right now im using data maybe thats why i have object
[20:06:52] <tw2113> codepython777 http://jsbin.com/oneqel/1/edit
[20:07:27] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:08:33] <rodd> back and light as a kite
[20:09:33] <zorph> axscode, I don't get what your trying to do..and what the error is...I need context
[20:09:52] <LindsayMac> YIKES.... managed to open my website in a lightbox on itself.. its like a paradigm
[20:10:34] <codepython777> tw2113: thanks.
[20:11:13] <axscode> zorph: it should be data[i] grr.. thanks a lot.. its fixed now
[20:11:41] <codepython777> tw2113: I'm more looking for something like what netflix does. Have you seen their popup when one hovers over the image?
[20:11:54] <zorph> ok
[20:12:30] <tw2113> nope
[20:13:15] <tw2113> may have to link to an example
[20:14:52] <codepython777> tw2113: http://www.hackingnetflix.com/photos/uncategorized/safaripopup.jpg
[20:14:57] <codepython777> one has to login to get that to work
[20:15:03] <LindsayMac> fancybox hates me
[20:15:15] <defaultro> hey folks, when was timeline in chrome implemented? Is it new?
[20:15:31] <zorph> just create a div....position it relative to the hover link...toggle visibility on hover..
[20:15:35] <tw2113> so....basically the same thing i already did, with some extra css
[20:15:48] <LindsayMac> zorph:  thats where i am headed right now
[20:16:25] <zorph> to codepython777
[20:16:28] <codepython777> tw2113: how does one make a pointer to the element and then draw a box? It looks like a tooltip to me
[20:16:49] <tw2113> and it's possible with css
[20:17:02] <LindsayMac> I am probably going to get to that tomorrow.. its just plain frustrating that these big old scripts meant to save time end up taking it up.. but i guess I should learn my lesson from php dev in that its the same thing with trying to cut corners using WP plugins
[20:17:03] <zorph> codepython777, Have a hidden div..then show it..and position it relative..
[20:17:18] <tw2113> zorph i think he's worried more about the appearance of it
[20:17:22] <tw2113> at this point
[20:17:26] <Gates> whats wrong here
[20:17:29] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:17:50] <zorph> codepython777, so u know how to do it? just want it to look right?
[20:17:51] <LindsayMac> Gates:  you need a callback function...
[20:18:06] <Gates> i dont follow
[20:18:13] <Gates> i thought i was
[20:18:19] <LindsayMac> you also have syntax errors
[20:18:39] <Gates> my function is in a function
[20:18:41] <Gates> ?
[20:19:11] <LindsayMac> Gates:  i am new to this .. but my codng logic shows me you have two functions that stand alone..
[20:19:16] <codepython777> zorph: http://jsbin.com/oneqel/1/edit -- this does the basic trick.
[20:19:19] <LindsayMac> you havent gotten them to interact
[20:19:38] <Gates> read the end of them
[20:20:11] <LindsayMac> OMG.. im sorry
[20:20:20] <LindsayMac> my eyes are all tweaked.. your numbers looked the same to me
[20:20:28] <LindsayMac> but you do have a syntax error
[20:20:45] <LindsayMac> SyntaxError: syntax error
[20:20:45] <LindsayMac> [Break On This Error] 	
[20:20:45] <LindsayMac> });
[20:20:47] <LindsayMac> /_display/ (line 90, col 1)
[20:20:49] <LindsayMac> 	
[20:21:11] <Gates> lol
[20:21:19] <Gates> yes i fixed that but still error
[20:21:54] <LindsayMac> can you repost your fix
[20:21:57] <zorph> Gates, http://jsfiddle.net/ufZXE/9/
[20:22:12] <LindsayMac> zorph:  did it
[20:23:10] <Gates> why isnt it
[20:23:21] <LindsayMac> isn't what?
[20:23:29] <Gates> $(function() { Animate0(); });
[20:24:11] <zorph> cuz in fiddle..you choose the load event...
[20:24:28] <zorph> in real code you place Animate0() in a $(document).ready() callback
[20:27:45] <tw2113> codepython777 http://jsbin.com/oneqel/2/edit
[20:29:05] <zorph> codepython777, http://jsbin.com/oneqel/4/edit
[20:30:08] <tw2113> zorph i like how you have 2 background properties
[20:30:29] <zorph> urs is cuter...I just whipped it together..
[20:30:57] <zorph> I added background..but didn't see he already added a background
[20:31:10] <zorph> but you lost the hover..
[20:31:19] <tw2113> oh the css's, you're so powerful now
[20:32:15] <Gates> any ides why it goes from rounded to sharp edge nice and clean but then pops! - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:32:34] <LindsayMac> Gates:  lol.
[20:32:38] <LindsayMac> you've been at this too long!
[20:32:44] <Gates> im so fucking tired
[20:32:51] <LindsayMac> Look at Animate50 --- you have your radius set to 0px
[20:32:52] <Gates> i just want to finish this and goto bed
[20:32:58] <LindsayMac> Gates:  i feel ya!
[20:33:01] <Gates> yes it fades nice
[20:33:08] <Gates> but it gets it resets and POPS!
[20:33:13] <Gates> not fades backup
[20:33:17] <Gates> i saw it with the opacy too
[20:33:21] <LindsayMac> Gates:  the border radius is what you want.. ohhh
[20:33:31] <Gates> idk what i want
[20:33:36] <Gates> but no matter what i use, it has the problem
[20:33:36] <Gates> lol
[20:33:43] <LindsayMac> Gates:  i see what you are saying
[20:33:57] <LindsayMac> it's animating from 0px - 10px but not from 10px to 00pox
[20:34:02] <Gates> yes
[20:34:10] <zorph> Gates, ur css sets radius to 10px initially..then your first animation tries to animate to 10px..
[20:34:19] <Gates> oohh
[20:34:23] <Gates> <3
[20:34:31] <tw2113> *goes back to wireframing*
[20:34:44] <zorph> your first func should animate to 0...and second should animate back to 10px
[20:34:44] <Gates> but if u start with Animate50 it does the same issue?
[20:34:52] <Gates> zorph: doesnt work :|
[20:35:06] <zorph> why do u wanna animate border-radius?? that looks goofy
[20:35:07] <LindsayMac> its not animating from 10px - 0px
[20:35:18] <LindsayMac> zorph:  it will look like it's pulsing..
[20:35:28] <LindsayMac> i wouldnt judge.. he might have an AWESOME use for it
[20:35:35] <LindsayMac> can't just by a random fiddle..
[20:35:49] <Gates> see, http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:36:05] <Gates> zorph: i was just playing with differnt options
[20:36:22] <Gates> but they all have the issue, its just easiest to see with that
[20:36:25] <zorph> ya I know...
[20:36:42] <Gates> any ideas?
[20:36:44] <zorph> did I hear animated gif anyone?
[20:36:53] <LindsayMac> lol
[20:36:53] * tw2113 waits for LindsayMac to drop her bagel and go "wha? wireframing?"
[20:37:10] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  iw as too bbusy getting my ass outta here!
[20:37:29] <LindsayMac> i wanna see those tomorrow.. your homework is due tomorrow
[20:37:37] <LindsayMac> goodnight all
[20:37:49] <tw2113> pssh
[20:38:05] <zorph> go hibernate linds
[20:38:12] <zorph> dream about code
[20:38:26] <Gates> :[
[20:38:30] <LindsayMac> lol
[20:38:33] <Gates> fml
[20:38:47] <zorph> jsfiddler on the roof
[20:39:15] <Gates> BOOM!
[20:39:18] <Gates> so there is no good
[20:43:08] <Dreamer3> ok
[20:43:38] <Dreamer3> so where is the best place to hook into the ajax cycle if i want to do something like rip out embedded JSON in HTML and stuff it in a method on the jqXHR object?
[20:44:03] <Dreamer3> i was thinking global success, but that runs after local success
[20:44:24] <Gates> fml
[20:45:21] <ajpiano> Dreamer3: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[20:46:07] <Dreamer3> read that, but i'll take a look at transports.. pre filters and converters are no good IIUC
[20:46:47] <ajpiano> yeah, i think a transport is exactly what you need
[20:47:38] <Dreamer3> transports can work if i use a custom datatype for all requests and then return an array of data, but i don't want to do that
[20:47:44] <Dreamer3> i mean converters
[20:47:50] <Dreamer3> that was my first idea
[20:48:05] <Gates> but seriously
[20:48:17] <Gates> can anyone figure out why it "pops" between animations
[20:48:18] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:51:29] <Gates> at the end of the animation the animation doesnt stay?
[20:51:32] <Gates> any idaeas?
[20:53:07] <Gates> it needs to fade up and down in 1 single anmiation
[20:53:10] <Gates> and then loop back to intself
[20:53:15] <Gates> is that possible?
[20:55:13] <zorph> Gates, http://jsfiddle.net/ufZXE/13/ I don't see any pop
[20:55:44] <Gates> zorph: right after it fades up
[20:55:58] <Gates> and before it fades away
[20:57:54] <Gates> zorph: this does not loop, look at it right before it ends, as it fades back up - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[20:57:56] <Gates> do u see it?
[20:58:33] <Dreamer3> yeah this might be a  little too low-level
[20:58:58] <Gates> it seems to bold the text almost
[21:00:16] <Gates> am i crazy
[21:00:34] <zorph> no I don't see it...
[21:01:08] <zorph> sry I'm takin off
[21:02:45] <Gates> :(
[21:03:23] <coldhead> bot-t: tell zorph Gates says thanks for nothing
[21:03:24] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:03:27] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[21:03:28] * bot-t sighs
[21:03:31] <Gates> lol
[21:03:44] <Gates> i can delay between animations?
[21:03:46] <Gates> any ideas?
[21:03:49] <Gates> is it .delay()
[21:04:40] <shoky> Gates: yep
[21:04:50] <coldhead> ?delay
[21:04:51] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:05:18] <Gates> do u guys see the delay?
[21:05:21] <Gates> err the "pop"
[21:05:22] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/ufZXE/
[21:05:26] <Gates> with the delay its more obvious
[21:05:31] <Gates> the font seems to go bold or something
[21:06:26] <Gates> coldhead or shoky : ^
[21:06:40] <shoky> Gates: what's the problem?
[21:06:57] <Gates> the button should fade to 0.8 and back to 1.0 and loop
[21:07:05] <shoky> it does
[21:07:12] <Gates> but after each animation the font does something strange
[21:07:45] <shoky> donno what you mean
[21:08:28] <coldhead> i don't see any font weirdness
[21:08:37] <coldhead> partly because i haven't loaded your demo
[21:08:43] <coldhead> and partly because i have my eyes closed
[21:09:41] <coldhead> no, i really don't see any bolding
[21:09:51] <coldhead> i'm in chrome on ubuntu
[21:11:48] <Gates> heres a screenshot
[21:11:51] <Gates> http://cl.ly/image/1I2l2O0P2q14/o
[21:11:53] <Gates> (1)
[21:12:03] <Gates> http://cl.ly/image/1g1T0u0s0V0x/o
[21:12:04] <Gates> (2)
[21:12:13] <Gates> do you see a difference in the font weight?
[21:12:54] <coldhead> i see it there
[21:12:59] <coldhead> not on my browser
[21:13:27] <coldhead> maybe related to the font-family implementation on that browser
[21:13:59] <Gates> thats true
[21:14:09] <Gates> guess i can only check by removing it in the test area
[21:14:29] <Gates> ..nope
[21:30:58] <Las3r> 'morning
[21:31:28] <tash1> I've never used jsfiddle.net before, so I'm a little confused.  I'm trying to solve an issue and I put some stuff up in the fiddle so I could start asking questions. http://jsfiddle.net/EBzc6/
[21:32:17] <tash1> if you look in my js, you'll see one of the last lines where I'm doing $( "#"+col ).val( val );
[21:32:32] <tash1> val works for all of the <td>'s in the html that aren't a checkbox
[21:33:01] <tash1> how can I get the checked="checked" and put it into a var like I did for val = $( this ).text(); ?
[21:33:56] <Las3r> is this a static structure, or do the TDs change?
[21:33:59] <Las3r> (rel)
[21:34:24] <tash1> static
[21:34:51] <tash1> I just thought of possibly a better question to ask though
[21:35:17] <ivankuzev> tash1: to check if the checkbock is checked you do $("#checkbox").is("[checked=checked]")...if i am not mistaken
[21:35:20] <tash1> <td rel="production-list-received"><input ........................ /></td> ..... the input is a child of the td in this context right?
[21:35:46] <ivankuzev> tash1: yes it is child
[21:35:49] <Las3r> yep
[21:36:03] <tash1> how can I grab the child? is there a .child?
[21:36:20] <ivankuzev> nope there is .children()
[21:36:23] <tash1> $( this ).child().prop('checked', 'checked') is what I'm thinking
[21:36:26] <tash1> oh, hmm
[21:36:48] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[21:36:59] <Las3r> if ($(this).attr("rel") == "production-list-received") { .... }
[21:37:06] <ivankuzev> but you may want to look at the useage of .children()...to get only the <input> you need
[21:38:21] <tash1> Las3r: I've got something like that already
[21:38:23] <tash1> var col = $( this ).attr( "rel" ),
[21:38:30] <tash1> if ( col == "production-list-received" )
[21:38:35] <Las3r> I came here for a question as well - maybe someone can give me a heads up... I'm working on an already built web-application using jquery+ui -> I'm having issues with the UI library, all elements that I created (dialog, datepicker) appear, and don't dissappear. Also they don't listen to their initialisation parameters (e.g. the dialog doesn't hide automatically). Hard for me to do on fiddle, as a normal implementation works properly, it 
[21:38:38] <Las3r> work with my web applicatio
[21:38:54] <tash1> what I'm trying to get is whether or not that input/checkbox is checked for that col
[21:39:43] <ruby_on_tails> tash1: if($("input").is(":checked"))
[21:44:16] <tash1> ruby_on_tails: ty
[21:54:56] <yen_> how to add attach a js callback function to a slide transition , example here http://www.ivillage.com/no-cook-appetizers/3-b-408105#408127
[22:00:33] <tash1> can you assign the value of something with jq?  And, I mean the value attribute, like value="foobar"
[22:01:29] <tash1> so, id is test for example... $( '#test' ).attr( 'value').varl(1);
[22:01:35] <tash1> s/varl/val
[22:01:45] <tash1> what would the correct way of doing it be?
[22:02:03] <ivankuzev> use $(input).val(value) instead
[22:03:48] <ivankuzev> tash1: in your case $("#test").val(1) will do the same as setting the attribute value to 1
[22:04:37] <tash1> oh
[22:05:58] <ENQ> i have a question about css, is it possible to apply styling to parent if its child is in some state? example, checkbox checked
[22:06:08] <ENQ> using only css
[22:06:43] <mindis|wurk> no
[22:06:57] <ENQ> damn :/
[22:07:20] <ENQ> well, then how to style radio buttons to look like buttons? :D
[22:07:33] <ENQ> like twitter bootstrap offers, but it uses js
[22:07:39] <ENQ> or jquery ui
[22:07:42] <mindis|wurk> you can't without js
[22:07:56] <mindis|wurk> css and form elements => bullshit
[22:08:08] <ENQ> hard to syle?
[22:08:15] <mindis|wurk> more like impossible
[22:08:25] <ENQ> i see
[22:08:34] <ENQ> thanks for help :)
[22:08:53] <mindis|wurk> take the file element for example. there's almost nothing you can do to it with just css
[22:09:58] <tash1> ivankuzev: that doesn't seem to be ture in my case.
[22:10:02] <ENQ> i use bootstrap so, i dont style it by myself, but in past had some hard times while trying to do some nicer forms
[22:10:31] <mindis|wurk> of all the things that are bad with css, form elements are probably the worst
[22:10:39] <ivankuzev> tash1:why?\
[22:10:48] <ivankuzev> tash1:whats different?
[22:11:05] <tash1> when I inspect the element with firebug, value=""
[22:11:30] <tash1> this is in some if statment though, one sec
[22:11:43] <ENQ> hmm
[22:11:53] <tash1> http://pastebin.com/5if7uL2T
[22:11:54] <tw2113> ENQ twitter boostrap doesn't use real radio buttons, assuming you're looking at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#buttons
[22:12:01] <tash1> ivankuzev: ^
[22:12:24] <tash1> see the .prop I'm doing there?  That works ... but the .val() on the same id isn't working
[22:12:45] <ENQ> yes tw2113 but if js is disabled, there is no fallback =/
[22:12:47] <ivankuzev> tash1:val wont work on checkboxes
[22:12:56] <ENQ> and it doesnt submit in form
[22:13:05] <tash1> oh damn ..
[22:13:06] <tw2113> anyone with js disabled in 2012, is experiencing a very shitty time online
[22:13:12] <tash1> I need to submit a value of 1 in that case
[22:13:19] <tash1> maybe a hidden type or something?
[22:13:24] <ivankuzev> tash1: try attr("checked","checked") instead
[22:13:38] <ENQ> tw2113, still it doesnt submit in form :/
[22:13:52] <tash1> ivankuzev: why? prop works ... is attr better?
[22:14:10] <mindis|wurk> i'd be surprised if there weren't a jquery/js solution that didn't take existing radio buttons and replace them with custom elements. that way you can have both pretty buttons for most people and crappy ancient shit for those with js disabled
[22:14:15] <ivankuzev> actually ....i think its the same
[22:14:58] <ENQ> hmm
[22:15:12] <mindis|wurk> tbh it's not very hard to write one yourself though
[22:15:53] <ENQ> ill try to search, would be cool to find something for bootstrap
[22:16:08] <tw2113> i say let the no-js people suffer
[22:16:44] <ENQ> well i don't whant to put to much js to page
[22:17:03] <flint> then use a javascript minimizer
[22:17:11] <flint> and it takes a LOT before thats a concern
[22:17:23] <mindis|wurk> replacing stuff on page load is hardly debilitating for any hardware
[22:17:29] <tw2113> technically rule of thumb says the site SHOULD function without
[22:17:36] <tw2113> if it doesn't you're doing something wrong
[22:18:37] <tw2113> i like how facebook just showed me an ad for "Bleeding Edge Javascript!" job opening, and the picture shown with it is some female
[22:18:58] <mindis|wurk> with javascript, every day is that day of the month!
[22:19:49] <ivankuzev> tash1: now that i look at it...checkbox seems to send its value(whatever you set using .val()) only when its checked
[22:20:22] <ivankuzev> tash1: you probably have to do some checking serverside for when its not checked
[22:20:46] <mindis|wurk> "probably"? :D
[22:20:49] <ivankuzev> ...or use a hidden field...or send a asynch $.post()
[22:22:45] <ivankuzev>  /msg NickServ identify peach181
[22:23:05] <mindis|wurk> oops :P
[22:23:29] <Guest91767>  /msg NickServ release ivankuzev peach181
[22:23:44] <Guest91767> yeah ooops
[22:23:52] <snover> cool password bro
[22:25:18] <ivankuzev>  /msg NickServ identify peach181
[22:26:04] <ivankuzev> phew....i managed to change it in time
[22:26:27] <ruby_on_tails> i was just about to crack it
[22:26:55] <yen_> tw2113 you are back
[22:27:04] <tw2113> from where?
[22:27:15] <yen_> You signed off i thought..like for a bit
[22:27:26] <tw2113> i just left #wordpress
[22:27:31] <yen_> ah...
[22:27:46] <yen_> I came here too now, pretty much to find out what u told me :-)
[22:28:01] <tw2113> succeeded?
[22:28:19] <yen_> no havent asked yet
[22:28:59] <yen_> how to do I attach a js callback function to a slide transition so that each image loads a new URL , example here http://www.ivillage.com/no-cook-appetizers/3-b-408105#408127
[22:29:05] <tw2113> [11:54pm] <yen_> how to add attach a js callback function to a slide transition , example here http://www.ivillage.com/no-cook-appetizers/3-b-408105#408127
[22:29:29] <yen_> whats that?
[22:29:33] <tw2113> you earlier
[22:29:41] <yen_> huh? from wordpress?
[22:29:44] <yen_> thanks!
[22:29:48] <tw2113> from #jquery
[22:30:00] <yen_> oh..:-s
[22:30:12] <yen_> did anyone answer?
[22:30:20] <tw2113> nope
[22:30:47] <yen_> :-(
[22:30:56] <ivankuzev> which function u use for sliding?
[22:31:27] <tw2113> for those curious, for some reason yen_ needs to track views on individual slides in a slider
[22:32:10] <yen_> yes! example here http://www.ivillage.com/no-cook-appetizers/3-b-408105#408127  -- u see how every time you click on the next arrow, a new url loads. thats what i need to figure out how to do
[22:32:39] <yen_> this seems to be the only site that i could find that is doing it like that.
[22:33:23] <yen_> ivankuzev was that q for me?
[22:35:17] <yen_> tw2113 looks like its not my day :-s
[22:35:32] <ivankuzev> <yen_>: well i seem to be interested in helping
[22:36:10] <yen_> ah...thanks ivankuzev someone! do u see my dilemma with figure this out?
[22:36:18] <tw2113> it's also 12am in my part of the word, give or take a couple hours one direction or the other
[22:36:33] <yen_> it's 1:30am in mine.
[22:36:37] <yen_> lol
[22:36:40] <tw2113> the dilemma is why you need to track the slide views
[22:36:41] <ivankuzev> morning here so i dont have that problem
[22:36:53] <yen_> ivankuzev -- lucky u
[22:37:20] <yen_> the dilemma is somethng that i just have to solve. They need to track the views, thats not somethng I have to worry about
[22:37:23] <ivankuzev> <yen_>:  from what i understand you want to make a behavour similar to the orange arrows?
[22:37:31] <yen_> ivankuzev yes
[22:37:43] <tw2113> he wants to tack on google analytics to individual slides
[22:37:52] <yen_> she"
[22:37:56] <yen_> she**
[22:37:58] <tw2113> they
[22:38:09] <yen_> oh sorry i thought u were talkng abt me
[22:38:22] <yen_> Yes, each slide has to be a new 'view"
[22:40:14] <ivankuzev> <yen_>:here is one idea, you can get the url of the image and the analythics from a $.post(or $.get) then load the image and analithics and show the image
[22:40:45] <ivankuzev> yen_:will that work?
[22:40:47] <yen_> ivankuzev but wouldnt that just be for one image?
[22:40:55] <yen_> i need for each image in the slide.
[22:41:15] <ivankuzev> well you load different url each time someone presses the arrow
[22:41:28] <yen_> so 100 people could come to a post but not everyone may see each image in a slideshow
[22:42:10] <yen_> ivankuzev -- I guess I didnt follow how you explained it. Sorry. Can you try one more time.
[22:42:13] <ivankuzev> yen_:if you decide to give them a different image...they could even see diferent images
[22:43:32] <yen_> yes, thats right. Each image would have a new URL.
[22:43:38] <ivankuzev> yen_: ok here is one more time.....when the user clicks arrow for the next image...your script(or whatever you have serverside) gives him/her the url of the next image.
[22:43:55] <yen_> ivankuzev ok. awesome. then?
[22:44:40] <yen_> the next image loads within the same slideshow but is counted as a new view?
[22:44:43] <ivankuzev> then you make an $("<img>") element ...wait for the image to load
[22:45:46] <coldhead> HERE YE HERE YE, GORE VIDAL IS DEAD
[22:46:13] <ruby_on_tails> my condolences
[22:46:13] <yen_> the next image loads within the same slideshow but is counted as a new view? ivankuzev
[22:56:20] <djsounds02> heeelllpppppp
[22:57:19] <flint> whats up?
[22:58:03] <djsounds02> kubeonedesign.co.uk/refrigeration
[22:58:11] <djsounds02> http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/refrigeration
[22:58:14] <krz> how do i search all p elements and return the one with 'foo'
[22:58:40] <djsounds02> flint: my rotator at the top has stopped working :(
[22:59:03] <djsounds02> flint: it was working earlier though
[22:59:45] <krz> anyone?
[23:00:15] <ivankuzev> krz:what is foo?
[23:00:33] <krz> <p>foo</p>
[23:00:43] <krz> ivankuzev: ^^
[23:00:55] <krz> contaings?
[23:01:20] <ivankuzev> $("p").text()
[23:01:34] <ivankuzev> $("p").html()
[23:01:35] <Shanecowherd> How can I select the children of the root element?  $(window).children() ???
[23:01:40] <krz> its :contains
[23:02:41] <tw2113> $('p.foo') ?
[23:02:45] <bailus> Shanecowherd: $('html').children()
[23:03:15] <Shanecowherd> bailus: if I don't have an <html> will it still work?
[23:03:52] <bailus> you dont need it in your html... the browser automatically makes one for you
[23:04:07] <Shanecowherd> bailus: thanks
[23:05:07] <Shanecowherd> bailus: I found it for my specific project, its $("html *").children()
[23:05:49] <bailus> html * matches everything
[23:06:00] <bailus> you probably want html > *
[23:06:02] <bailus> or body
[23:07:46] <Shanecowherd> I want to get the first 25 html elements
[23:07:57] <Shanecowherd> I was trying to .slice(0,25) on html *
[23:08:19] <mindis|wurk> i wonder what you're really trying to do :P
[23:08:21] <Shanecowherd> but the file I'm using as a source doesn't have <html> <body>, it starts with a <p>
[23:08:57] <bailus> the browser creates html and body for you
[23:09:16] <Shanecowherd> thanks
[23:09:27] <EnginA> hmmm I have a canvas <div id="canvas"></div>. There's a toolbox where user drag-n-drop widget from, to canvas. All widgets are of class .widget. Each widget has some initalization code which might generate html and insert in them. Also there are configuration UI's generated and embedded in these .widget's. What I want finally is to get the HTML code for all DOM tree elements in #canvas. But I only want to
[23:09:29] <EnginA>  get the .widget elements while preserving the tree structure. Do you think is that possible ?
[23:11:03] <EnginA> maybe a deep copy clone() and remove()
[23:11:11] <tw2113> yen_ see what you can brain up with this http://arplis.com/how-to-track-custom-url-in-google-analytics-manually-with-javascript/
[23:15:39] <coldhead> be specific, give examples
[23:16:21] <Shanecowherd> I have a slice of 25 objects, how can I concatenate their html into one big string?
[23:17:25] <yen_> tw2113 thanks
[23:20:05] <EnginA> Shanecowherd: if they are selected just do an .each(function(){ global_scope_html_string += $(this).html(); }
[23:20:35] <Shanecowherd> EnginA: I'll try that, thanks
[23:20:44] <bailus> wouldn't $(object).html() work?
[23:21:17] <EnginA> haha, now thinking of it, yeah, I don't see why not
[23:21:35] <Shanecowherd> like $(".person").slice(0,25) ….I want to convert all of those objects into a string so I can print it out
[23:22:25] <bailus> $(".person").slice(0,25).html()
[23:22:52] <coldhead> EnginA: that will return the innerHTML not the outerHTML
[23:34:03] <yen_> tw2113 so this short strng can be added to small elements on the page to track viewS?
[23:43:09] <tw2113> what does it say?
[23:44:12] <yen_> talking em me tw2113
[23:44:20] <yen_> to*
[23:44:26] <tw2113> i haven't seen anyone else say anything in 22 minutes
[23:45:20] <yen_> dont be mean!
[23:45:38] <yen_> yes, i think the way i interpretted it was that it is like a pixel tracker
[23:45:57] <yen_> so basically it can track something less than a full pageview
[23:45:57] <yen_> ?
[23:46:33] <tw2113> i found that by searching "toggle google analytics manually"
[23:46:59] <yen_> i think i need it to show up as a page view, a new page view.
[23:47:13] <yen_> so im nt sure if pixel/click tracking will work
[23:47:14] <yen_> :-s
[23:48:51] <tw2113> here's part of what that page showed
[23:48:52] <tw2113> _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
[23:49:10] <tw2113> basically, it pushes to activate an event
[23:49:17] <tw2113> the _trackPageview
[23:49:26] <tw2113> normally, that happens 1 time a page
[23:49:42] <tw2113> <a href="#" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/somelink/']);">Link Tracking</a>
[23:49:53] <tw2113> almost the same thing
[23:49:59] <tw2113> only happens on click
[23:50:04] <tw2113> and you pass in a 2nd parameter
[23:50:16] <tw2113> in this case, a specific link, relative to the page
[23:50:55] <tw2113> with me so far?
[23:51:07] <reqqq> Greetings. A quick question, if I bind into mousedown events using anonymouse functions like $(el).mousedown(function() {});  is there a way I could get a reference to that function later? $(el).mousedown returns a completely different function, so I guess that's not the correct way?
[23:52:32] <Shanecowherd> is outerHtml built into jquery?
[23:53:57] <tw2113> ?outerHTML
[23:53:58] <bot-t> jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[23:54:23] <reqqq> Shanecowherd: I think not, but there's a plugin for that. outerHTML is a browser funtion but I'm not sure if it's 100% cross-browser
[23:54:49] <Shanecowherd> thanks
[23:55:15] <tw2113> yen_ ?
[23:55:52] <tw2113> *wanders off to the bathroom*
[23:56:13] <yen_> yes?
[23:56:31] <yen_> hold on catching up
[23:57:24] <yen_> so ur saying that i dont need any JS, just tracking fix?
[23:57:34] <tw2113> this IS js
[23:57:41] <tw2113> i just stopped to make sure you were with me so far
[23:58:38] <tw2113> yes or no, are you with me so far
[23:58:42] <tw2113> and at least somewhat comprehending
